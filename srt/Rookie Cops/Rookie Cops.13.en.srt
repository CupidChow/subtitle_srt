1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,045
This obviously shows that it's you.

2
00:00:04,587 --> 00:00:06,631
(suspenseful music)

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:12,887
ARI: See? I'm a huge fan.
I even took a photo with him.

4
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:15,932
Isn't that watch gorgeous?
Apparently, it's one of a kind.

5
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,809
It's custom-made by a Swiss artisan.

6
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:19,978
I know who he is.

7
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,651
(suspenseful music continues)

8
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:31,531
EUNKANG: It's Jo Hansol.

9
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:35,577
He was looking for the laptop because
of the watch that can identify him.

10
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:38,246
You're right. It's the same.

11
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:43,585
Do you think the guy who came to our place
was Jo Hansol's man too?

12
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:44,669
I think so.

13
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:47,255
I should hurry
and tell Detective Kang about this.

14
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:48,631
EUNKANG: Hang on, Seunghyun.

15
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:51,342
If the guy in the video
is really Jo Hansol,

16
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:53,803
wouldn't it be better to ask

17
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:56,222
your father to take care of it?

18
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:57,515
My father?

19
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:59,601
EUNKANG: He's a high-ranking official,

20
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:02,562
so it'd be better if he takes care of it.

21
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:06,232
Plus, Detective Kang is in Gangneung.
It'll be a hassle to come here.

22
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:07,817
That's true, but...

23
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:11,196
NAMGI: Don't show the video to anyone
until I get there.

24
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:12,530
Not even the police.

25
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:14,699
EUNKANG: To be honest,

26
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:17,660
we don't really know Detective Kang.

27
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,413
Isn't your father more trustworthy?

28
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:24,000
(suspenseful music)

29
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,132
(music fades)

30
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:38,056
So you're saying this man is Jo Hansol.

31
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:39,766
I think so.

32
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:41,935
We'll have to investigate further, though.

33
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:43,311
You said...

34
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:47,148
Gangneung Police Station is working
on the dead woman's case?

35
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:49,025
I talked to the detective
in charge earlier,

36
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:52,737
and he said the cause of her death
was a drug overdose.

37
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:55,532
Judging by what I've seen,

38
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:59,577
I think this video has something to do
with Min Haeji's death.

39
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,164
All right.

40
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:05,792
I'll hand this laptop...

41
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,753
to the investigations unit.

42
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:12,173
But I was supposed to meet the detective.

43
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:16,386
He's coming from Gangneung tonight.

44
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:19,222
-Who's the detective?
-His name is Kang Namgi.

45
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,850
(ominous music)

46
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:23,977
Mm-mm.
(clicks tongue)

47
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:27,021
This is too big a case for a detective
from a small regional office.

48
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:31,067
I'll take care of it,
so don't worry about it.

49
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,569
(intense music)

50
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:35,071
And make sure
your friends don't speak about this.

51
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,573
Yes, I will.

52
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,409
GANGNEUNG

53
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,619
LEE (over phone): We checked Min Haeji's
travel history,

54
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:44,080
and she visited Guam early last month
with Jo Hansol,

55
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,707
CEO of Changui Investment.

56
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,750
Why did you want to look into this?

57
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:49,669
Did something happen?

58
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,756
I'll tell you later. Okay. Thanks.

59
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:58,303
OPERATOR: The person you have reached
is unavailable. Please...

60
00:02:58,386 --> 00:02:59,345
(phone beeps)

61
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,264
(keypad clacking)

62
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:04,434
SEUNGHYUN: Sir, did you leave already?

63
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:06,269
I don't think you have to come.

64
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:09,522
I gave the laptop to my father,
who is also a cop.

65
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,274
You can rely on him.

66
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,069
TAK: Well done.

67
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,655
I'm sure your father will take care of it.

68
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:18,907
Don't worry.

69
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,826
But you did tell Detective Kang
about it, though, right?

70
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,454
That Jo Hansol was filmed in it.

71
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:25,496
Not yet.

72
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:26,915
(both panting)

73
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:29,542
I was going to when we meet,
but my father said

74
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,669
I shouldn't tell anyone about it.

75
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,047
Gosh, I'm running out of breath.

76
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,798
Are you already tired?

77
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,508
We just started to run.

78
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,887
Hey, you're not going to bed
unless you run 10km today. Okay?

79
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:41,930
(chuckles)

80
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:45,141
Gosh. Stop nagging me. I'm hanging up.

81
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,018
(beeps)

82
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,480
(crickets creaking)

83
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,692
(foreboding music)

84
00:03:57,153 --> 00:04:00,156
-(phone beeps)
-(phone line ringing)

85
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,158
It's Yulma Park.

86
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:13,294
(foreboding music continues)

87
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:15,797
(cellphone buzzing)

88
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,132
-Yes, Detective.
-NAMGI: What are you talking about?

89
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,134
I told you not to give it to anyone!

90
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:21,094
Sorry.

91
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:24,806
But you don't have to worry.
My father is a cop too.

92
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:26,432
Not Commissioner Wi!

93
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,518
-You don't know what kind of person he is.
-What?

94
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:30,812
-What do you...
-NAMGI: Was there...

95
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:32,021
Jo Hansol in the video?

96
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,231
How did you...

97
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:35,817
(sighs)

98
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:40,655
(sighs)
Where are you?

99
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:42,156
SEUNGHYUN: In Yulma Park.

100
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,449
(suspenseful music)

101
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,201
-(engine revving)
-(tire screeches)

102
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,998
(tire screeches)

103
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,339
(keypad clacking)

104
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:03,678
(phone line ringing)

105
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:17,233
INCOMING CALL
SON

106
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:26,534
(sighs)

107
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,079
(ominous music)

108
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,960
(theme music)

109
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,760
EPISODE 13

110
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,181
(sighs)
I'm so glad

111
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,309
it ended up in your hands.

112
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,563
(exhales sharply)
This is the last time.

113
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:58,649
I don't care about the Sinyu Club or
whatever. If you ever blackmail me again,

114
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:02,111
then we'll all be done for.

115
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:05,656
We've been in the same boat for ages now.
Can't we just get along?

116
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:10,495
-I said I'd treat you as a close friend...
-Shut up.

117
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,539
I've never been friends
with the likes of you.

118
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:16,417
(laughing)

119
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,047
HANSOL: Don't be like that.

120
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:24,675
If you wanted to end this,
you should have done it ten years ago.

121
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,304
(suspenseful music)

122
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,060
(group clamoring)

123
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:35,853
(indistinct chattering)

124
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,691
(Inmyeon laughing)

125
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,610
Oh, you're here.

126
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:44,278
(Inmyeon laughing continues)

127
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:47,448
HYUNTAE: Well, this is my son.

128
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:49,700
-Please look favorably upon him.
-(Inmyeon laughing)

129
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,661
Sir. This way.

130
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:52,620
Let's go.

131
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,167
-(breathes heavily)
-HANSOL: It's a simple matter.

132
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:01,045
Just think about what you need to protect.

133
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,591
(suspenseful music continues)

134
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:11,013
(Giyong breathes shakily)

135
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:20,857
Just because there's no evidence

136
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,234
doesn't mean
you haven't committed any crime.

137
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,027
That's not true.

138
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:29,323
No evidence, no crime.

139
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,411
That's what you did back then too.

140
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:37,748
(ominous music)

141
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:39,876
(music fades)

142
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,589
(dramatic music)

143
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:48,593
(sighs)

144
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:54,682
(crickets creaking)

145
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:02,523
(dramatic music continues)

146
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,156
-SEUNGHYUN: Dad?
-(engine starts)

147
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:17,288
What? Secretary Shin?

148
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:19,665
(suspenseful music)

149
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:22,460
(door closes)

150
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,923
(suspenseful music rises)

151
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:38,684
(car engine starts)

152
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:42,104
(engine revving)

153
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:44,649
(music intesifies)

154
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:09,632
(engine stops)

155
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:17,390
NAMGI: Commissioner Wi can't get
a hold of that!

156
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:19,308
Go get it back. Now!

157
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:23,437
My father is not supposed to have it?
What does that mean?

158
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:26,148
(exhales sharply)
You don't need to know. Just go get it.

159
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:27,525
I'll wait here.

160
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,943
Do you know my father?

161
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:32,905
Please tell me.
Otherwise, I can't give it to you.

162
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:37,076
What's the relationship between my father
and Jo Hansol?

163
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,662
Why are you suspecting my father?

164
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:40,955
Why?

165
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,333
Do you really want to know
what kind of person...

166
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:46,794
your father is?

167

AUGUST 2006
CLUB JOKER AT DAMOS HOTEL

169
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,474
NAMGI: Eleven years ago,

170
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:04,520
I got a tip-off from an informant
about Damos Group's CEO Jo Hyuntae

171
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:08,274
that he was offering
sexual favors to politicians

172
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:11,235
in order to evade taxes
and start a duty-free business.

173
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,323
Okay.

174
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:19,910
(engine revving)

175
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:24,790
TRUSTWORTHY POLICE, SAFE COUNTRY

176
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,753
But I couldn't investigate the case alone.

177
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,592
So I asked help from your father, who was
Captain of the DIU in Seoul at that time.

178
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:38,721
(suspenseful music)

179
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,184
(sighs)

180
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,561
So you want to work with me.

181
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:46,520
Yes.

182
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:49,857
I know you're after Jo Hansol.

183
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,235
NAMGI: Because your father
was investigating

184
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:56,322
Jo Hansol's drug trafficking.

185
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,741
(girls screaming)

186
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:02,370
(laughing)

187
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,084
We can catch two birds with one stone.

188
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:11,837
GIYONG: This is the guy.

189
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,256
I want you to give them
all the information

190
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:16,384
you've been collecting about the club.

191
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:19,679
Yes, sir.

192
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:21,806

00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,115
(shouting indistinctly in distance)

197
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:42,368
WAITER: Hey, junior!

198
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:43,869
Yes?

199
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:46,747
Leave that and go clean up
room number three.

200
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,124
Yes, sir.

201

DIRECTOR CHU MANSEOK

208
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:32,293
NAMGI: CEO Jo asked Director Chu
to make a list of those

209
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:34,628
who were offered sexual favors
just in case.

210
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:38,758
And we planted a KNPU student
to get that list.

Yes.

222
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:48,702
You were right, sir.

223
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,538
There was a lot of information.

224
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:52,331
Yes. Gosh.

225
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:54,083
Okay. I'll bring it to you right now.

226
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:55,584
All right.

227
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:57,878
Excuse me.

228
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:58,921
Sorry.

Not yet...

00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,187
Hyunsoo has to come out now.
Or he'll be in serious danger.

236
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,605
It's now or never.

237
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:19,108
We need to get the evidence...

238
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,236
to arrest Jo Hansol too.

239
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,322
NAMGI: As your father had commanded,

240
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:28,409
he went in to get the evidence
to arrest Jo Hansol

241
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,245

00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:52,900
CHIEF INVESTIGATOR WI GIYONG

333
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,903
That's how trashy your father is.

334
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,029
No.

335
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,072
That can't be true.

336
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,200
That can't be my father.

337
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,995
If you're so sure of it,
why don't you go ask him yourself?

338
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:08,207
Ask him what deal he had with Jo Hansol.

339
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:10,375
You'll see.

340
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:11,793
That laptop...

341
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,631
I'm sure it will end up
in Jo Hansol's hands.

342
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,966
(suspenseful music)

343
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,429
(Hansol grunting, screaming)

344
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,098
(grunts)

345
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:26,975
(grunts)

346
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,685
(whoops, yelps)

347
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:31,104
(eerie music)

348
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,859
(Hansol breathing heavily)

349
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:37,569
(groans)

350
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,780
(Hansol sighs)

351
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,202
Who else watched it?

352
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:47,871
There are two more.

353
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:49,706
They're both KNPU students.

354
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,459
EUISEOK: Commissioner Wi
will take care of his son.

355
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,127
What should we do with the rest?

356
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:55,879
Just leave them.

357
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,465
Without evidence,
there's nothing they can do.

358
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:01,218
But still, they watched the video.

359
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:03,762
I'll keep an eye on them
for the time being then.

360
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:09,434
(thuds)

361
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:17,859
(thuds)

362
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:23,407
(thuds)

363
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:29,496
-(grunts)
-(thuds)

364
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:36,878

365
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:40,090
INCOMING CALL
ARI

366
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:41,300
(sighs)

367
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:42,342
Hey, Ari.

368
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,387
I wanted to surprise you.

369
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:48,849
I'll be staying at school
for Police Academy until this weekend.

370
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:51,685
I asked the others for help since
the Promotions Corps is short-handed.

371
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:52,894
You need to help too.

372
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:55,355
What do you want me to do?

373
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,399
Um...

374
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,901
For now...

375
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:04,156
(whimsical music)

376
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:05,949
This.

377
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,793
-What about this?
-It's wild ginseng. I heard it's rare.

378
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:19,129
It's a present my dad got,
but I brought it for you.

379
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:21,173
(sighs)
If your father finds this out...

380
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:23,592
Mm-mm. He can't eat ginseng.

381
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,969
He gave it to me, so don't worry about it.

382
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,055
Then you should eat it. I can't take it.

383
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:29,473
Well...
(smack lips)

384
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:31,808
I'm trying to be a supportive girlfriend.

385
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:32,893
(Ari chuckles)

386
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:35,270
You're practicing for the triathlon thing
these days.

387
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:37,731
You've become so much thinner.

388
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,608
Eat this. It'll make you stronger.

389
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:40,650
(chuckles)

390
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:44,446
-Thanks.
-Also... this.

391
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:51,703
It's a joint supplement.
You said your grandmother had weak joints.

392
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:54,081
You seemed worried, so I got one.

393
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:56,333
You got one for my grandma too?

394
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:58,794
(chuckles)

395
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:04,591
-(phone buzzing)
-Huh?

396
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:06,635
(gasps)
The guys are here. Hide it.

397
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:09,429
They might take them
like the cookies last time. Hurry.

398
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:18,605
JUNIOR POLICE ACADEMY
PROMOTIONAL AND TEACHING MATERIALS

399
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:20,899
Am I the only one
who thinks this is heavy?

400
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:22,109
It's heavy for me too.

401
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:24,986
Gosh. That Ari...

402
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:27,864
JUNIOR POLICE ACADEMY
PROMOTIONAL AND TEACHING MATERIALS

403
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:31,118
-It's so heavy. My arms hurt so much.
-Hi, Tak.

404
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:33,203
-Hey.
-Hey, check the numbers.

405
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:34,913
If any are missing, we're in trouble.

406
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:37,457
We need to edit the school
presentation slides too after this.

407
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,960
All right. Easy, girl.

408
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:42,295
It hasn't even been an hour
since I came back from Mokpo.

409
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:44,297
Yeah, we're not even
in the Promotions Corps.

410
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:47,300
Daeil and Hanna aren't here today.
So you need to work twice as hard.

411
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,678
Tak came to help way before you guys.

412
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:51,763
By the way, when's Seunghyun coming?

413
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,682
ARI: I don't know. He wouldn't pick up.

414
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:57,144
That's strange. He never does that.

415
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:00,397
(dramatic music)

416
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:13,577

is unavailable.

423
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:40,979
-Why won't he answer the phone?
-(phone beeps)

424
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:43,565
(keypad clacking)

(wind chimes tinkle)

427
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:02,584
-EMPLOYEE: Enjoy.
-HANNA: Thank you.

428
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:11,134
HANNA: No, sit down.
You just got the cast removed yesterday.

429
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,053
You should be careful for now.

430
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:15,263
DAEIL: Thanks.

431
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:23,688
So did your student like
the essay-writing lecture?

432
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:25,232
Yes.

433
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:27,150
What a considerate kid.

434
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,070
I mean, you came all the way
to Seoul for it.

435
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:33,657
How did he know his teacher
wanted to come to Seoul?

436
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:36,952
I told him he had to take it
to get into a good school.

437
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:40,121
HANNA: Also, his parents asked me
to take him.

438
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:42,207
And I thought I could see you anyway.

439
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:45,210
Since I felt bad
for not visiting you at the hospital.

440
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,462
So don't read between the lines.

441
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,756
Seeing you make all these excuses,

442
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,675
I guess it does mean something.

443
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:54,219
-Whatever.
-Can't I read a little into it?

444
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:57,639
(light music playing)

445
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,725
(scoffs)

446
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:03,353
Huh?

447
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:04,980
-HANNA: What's that?
-(gasps)

448
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,856
Oh, that...

449
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,317
(whimsical music)

450
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,027
This is...

451
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:15,323
-Is it someone's birthday?
-What?

452
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:18,910
Well, I'm just curious.
Is it someone's birthday?

453
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:24,583
Right. It is.

454
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:27,168
It's my birthday.

455
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:29,671
A friend of mine gave it to me.

456
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,756
Is it your birthday today?

457
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:36,052
I guess you didn't know.

458
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:38,096
I'm disappointed.

459
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:41,266
Sorry. You should have told me.

460
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:46,146
If you're sorry, have dinner with me.

461
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:49,482
I found some good restaurants around here.

462
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:53,778
I booked a bus departing at six.

463
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:56,031
I see.

464
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:59,534
All right. I guess
we can do dinner another time.

465
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,745
Then how about...

466
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:07,334
we do something that we'll remember
for the rest of our lives?

467
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:12,922
(whimsical music continues)

468
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,803
(camera shutter clicks)

469
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:20,263
(camera shutter clicks)

470
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:24,476
(camera shutter clicks)

471
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:29,606
(camera shutter clicks)

472
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:32,192
Come on. Let's take one together.

473
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:35,028
I don't like taking photos.

474
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:36,905
They say photos are the best souvenirs.

475
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,783
-No, I'm good.
-But it's my birthday.

476
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,994
(upbeat music)

477
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:50,669
But do I really have to be holding this?

478
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:53,463
It's my birthday.

479
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:58,968
We look like we're dating
because I'm holding these.

480
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,012
It's my birthday.

481
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:03,556
Hurry it up then.

482
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:05,642
Here we go.

483
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:06,685
(clears throat)

484
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:08,478
One.

485
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:09,646
Two.

486
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:10,814
Three.

487
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:11,981
(camera shutter clicks)

488
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:15,193
(music fades)

489
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,280
What's wrong with this thing?

490
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,825
ARI: Try harder.

491
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:26,287
BUMJU: Come on.

492
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:27,872
That's not how you do it.

493
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:29,457
Watch me.

494
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:32,877
(clears throat)

495
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:36,131
Look. Do it in one motion.

496
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:37,757
(snaps)

497
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:40,260
-(Ari, Tak exclaims)
-(chuckles)

498
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:43,096
(clears throat)
Let me try again.

499
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,348
-(baton snaps)
-(Bumju grunts)

500
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:46,266
Huh!

501
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:49,769
(object clatters)

502
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:50,729
ARI: Oh, no.

503
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:52,313
-JUYOUNG: Hey.
-ARI: Are you all right?

504
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:53,773
-My goodness.
-You...

505
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:55,567
Hold on.

506
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:57,318
Ju...

507
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:58,486
(stammering)

508
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,821
-Hey.
-What do we do?

509
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,948
-Hey.
-Tak, please.

510
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:03,324
You should have been careful.

511
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,243
Maybe we should call an ambulance.

512
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:13,376
I can walk you to the train station.

513
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:16,629
I have to go pick up my student.
since the lecture's over.

514
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:20,884
I'll...

515
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,052
call you.

516
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:24,846
Okay.

517
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:26,681
But don't video call me.

518
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:28,683
Okay.

519
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:32,479
(uplifting music)

520
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:36,608
DAEIL: You take this.

521
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:39,819
What? Why would you give me
your birthday present?

522
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:41,863
Well, I'm a man.

523
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:44,741
It's kind of embarrassing
to take this home.

524
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:46,075
DAEIL: Come on.

525
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:49,913
I'll go then.

526
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:51,706
Hey.

527
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:56,961
HANNA: What's wrong with him?

528
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,088
-(gasps)
-(message tone)

529
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:04,719
YOO DAEIL

530
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:10,934
DAEIL: I bought the flowers for you.

531
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:15,396
Today being my birthday...

532
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,026
was a lie.

533
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:22,529
What?

534
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:25,406
(chuckles)

535
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:30,411
He picked a nice one.

536
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:32,539
(light music)

537
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:36,125
EUNKANG: I'm worried you aren't answering.

538
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:38,795
-Is everything okay?
-(sighs)

539
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,590
(line trilling)

540
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:45,969
Oh, you had an appointment.

541
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:49,305
I thought you were sick or something.

542
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:56,688
Did you give the laptop to your father?

543
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:57,897
SEUNGHYUN: Yes.

544
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:00,191
EUNGKANG: What did he say?
Was he surprised?

545
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:01,109
Yes.

546
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:02,735
Will he work on the case himself?

547
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:05,071
I guess he will.

548
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:08,825
I was so nervous
I couldn't sleep last night.

549
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:12,370
EUNKANG: If it is what we think it is...

550
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:13,538
Eunkang.

551
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:16,040
SEUNGHYUN: I have an appointment now.

552
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:17,876
Can we talk about the details later?

553
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:20,211
What? Okay, sure.

554
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:22,338
Let's talk later.

555
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:23,840
Bye.

EAST GYEONGGI PROVINCIAL POLICE AGENCY

558
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,696
Hey. Is everything all right?

559
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:48,615
-DETECTIVE: Yes, sir.
-Good. Take it easy.

560
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:50,033
(chuckles)

561
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:51,784
Goodness. You're working so hard.

562
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:53,161
-GARDINER: Hello, sir.
-(laughing)

563
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:56,873
Right. Your son's wedding
is next Saturday at three, right?

564
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:58,416
Yes.

565
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:01,169
As an officiant,
I'll make sure to prepare a great speech.

566
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:06,549
My son and in-laws are so excited
about having you as the officiant.

567
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:09,761
Thank you so much
for treating us like family.

568
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:11,346
I really appreciate your kindness.

569
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,556
Please. What are you saying?

570
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,642
We police are all family.

571
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:17,894
Whenever I'm free, anytime.

572
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:19,270
(both laughing)

573
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:20,605
-Thank you, sir.
-No problem.

574
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:22,649
-GIYONG: Then I'll see you then.
-GARDENER: Sure.

575
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,780
Hey, Seunghyun. You came.

576
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,243
-When did you arrive?
-Just now.

577
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:38,498
GIYONG: It'll be my sixth time
officiating at a wedding.

578
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,583
At first, I got so nervous

579
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:43,252
that I confused the bride's name
with the groom's name.

580
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:45,296
But now, I can even improvise jokes.

581
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,798
(laughing)

582
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,676
You haven't seen me officiating
at a wedding, have you?

583
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:51,719
(chuckles)

584
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:54,389
-(slurps)
-Hmm?

585
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:57,558
Hey. Don't drink so fast.

586
00:32:58,017 --> 00:32:59,394
GIYONG: Then you'll get drunk soon.

587
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:01,229
And when you're drunk,
you make mistakes...

588
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:06,234
All right.
You can get drunk in front of me.

589
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,318
But...

590
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:09,112
not anywhere else.

591
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:13,199
-GIYONG: Cops shouldn't get drunk.
-(pours liquid)

592
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:17,078
When I was in the third grade,

593
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:21,916
the two of us visited Grandpa's grave.
And on our way back,

594
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:23,751
we caught a hit-and-run driver

595
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:27,839
after chasing him on the highway
for 30 minutes.

596
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:29,173
Do you remember?

597
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:31,926
(sighs)
Did we?

598
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:35,138
You asked me to bring the handcuffs
from the car,

599
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,598
so I brought them to you.

600
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,810
I even helped you handcuff him.

601
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:44,814
Oh, right. I remember it now.
(laughing)

602
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:46,941
You were fascinated with the handcuffs

603
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,985
-because you haven't seen them before.
-Right.

604
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:51,529
In fact, that's when I decided...

605
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:54,699
to become a cop when I grew up.

606
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:57,910
Because you...

607
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,038
looked so cool then.

608
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,081
(chuckles)
Gosh.

609
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:04,667
You're flattering me.
(chuckles)

610
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:06,961
(slurps)

611
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,171
(cup clinks)

612
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:11,382
Did you...

613
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:12,759
(pours liquid)

614
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:14,343
...hand over the laptop

615
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,304
to the investigation unit?

616
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,973
(ominous music)

617
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:22,852
(breathes deeply)

618
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:24,103
Of course.

619
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:26,731
I told them to investigate it thoroughly.

620
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:30,651
-You don't have to worry about it anymore.
-I'm worried.

621
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:37,366
I haven't told you about it,
but I met CEO Jo Hansol once.

622
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:40,828
I heard you knew each other.

623
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,080
(scoffs)

624
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:46,751
Do you think I can't keep
my work and personal life separate?

625
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:50,463
(sighs)
Don't worry.

626
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:53,132
At my age and in my position,

627
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:55,468
I have rich friends and thug friends.

628
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:57,470
it's normal to know all kinds of people.

629
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:01,974
But, you two have
a special relationship...

630
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:04,977
(suspenseful tense music)

631
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,316
...is what I heard

632
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:12,777
from Detective Kang Namgi.

633
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:14,695
You met Detective Kang?

634
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,240
Yes.

635
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:21,494
He said you gave away the evidence before,

636
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:24,330
and you'd do the same this time.

637
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,625
SEUNGHYUN: I don't believe
everything he said.

638
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:30,211
But I still wanted to check.

639
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:32,964
-What did you want to check?
-SEUNGHYUN: The laptop.

640
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:37,385
Did you really hand it over
to the investigation unit?

641
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:38,386
I said I did.

642
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:41,556
Then why did you meet Mr. Jo last night?

643
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:43,808
It's not like you

644
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:46,310
to secretly meet a suspect

645
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:48,104
at such a late hour.

646
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:53,234
Because you never do anything
that can be misleading.

647
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:56,320
Did you...

648
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:59,282
give the laptop to Mr. Jo?

649
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:04,036
(tense music)

650
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:07,999
I said I didn't.

651
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,506
(slurps)

652
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,554
(slurps)

653
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:22,513
(cup clinks)

654
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:28,102
I hope I'm wrong.

655
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:34,650
(tense music continues)

656
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:39,280

00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,051

00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:01,177
(cellphone clatters)

664
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,056
MAN 1: Hey.

665
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,600
Where's my apology?

666
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:10,937
You're blocking my way, kiddo.

667
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:13,105
Say sorry right now. Hey.

668
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:18,486
(scoffs)
This jerk.

669
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:19,445
Hey.

670
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,113
(passerby clamoring)

671
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:22,615
Come here.

672
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:24,867
You little bastard. You've got no respect.

673
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:26,160
You're supposed to say sorry.

674
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,245
Hey, stop.

675
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:29,872
Get off of me! This kid has lost his mind.

676
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:32,583
Hey. Come here, you bastard.

677
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:34,168
-MAN 1: You bastard.
-MAN 2: Hey, stop.

678
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:38,589
MAN 1: This kid's
an absolute lunatic. Hey!

00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:42,009
INCOMING CALL

680
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:44,345
Hello?

681
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:46,806
Yes, that's me.

682
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:50,059
Where?

683
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:51,143
POLICE

684
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:54,981
(sighs)

685
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:58,067
Professor Cha Ugon?

686
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,443
-Yes.
-Hello.

687
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:01,153
He's over there.

688
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:03,322
(indistinct chattering)

689
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,117
(sighs)

690
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:08,494
(whirring)

691
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:15,418
Great job. You must've called me

692
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,713
because you wanted to be punished, right?

693
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,590
You wanted the school to know, is that it?

694
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:22,883
I'm sorry.

695
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:25,511
I'll gladly accept any punishment.

696
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:28,681
If you wanted to be beaten so much,
you should've asked me.

697
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:34,979
Do you want to go see a doctor?

698
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:37,106
No.

699
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:41,360
So, do you feel better now?

700
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:46,073
(somber music)

701
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:49,160
(breathes deeply)
Detective Kang called me.

702
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,374
Hey. I told you
to leave my students alone.

703
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:57,626
If you have problems with Commissioner Wi,
talk to him!

704
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:58,919
Don't bother the kids!

705
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,379
NAMGI: He needs to know too.

706
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:02,173
Call me a coward if you want.

707
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:03,966
I don't care.

708
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,427
(scoffs)
If you don't care, why did you call me?

709
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:07,928
(sighs)

710
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:09,764
I don't know.

711
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:13,976
I'm not sure why I called you.

712
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:17,271
I shouldn't have to worry
about Commissioner Wi's son.

713
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:19,231
(sighs)

714
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:21,525
NAMGI: Anyway, you're his teacher,

715
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:22,526
so call him.

716
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:24,695
I don't want to lose anyone...

717
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,031
anymore.

718
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:32,078
UGON: Apparently, he felt bad
after you left like that.

719
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:35,373
Do you know Detective Kang?

720
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:39,335
We were on the same team once.
Along with your father.

721
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:42,838
(crickets creaking)

722
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:50,679
(inhales)

723
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:52,056
You can sleep here tonight.

724
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:53,849
Thanks, Professor.

725
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:55,684
Don't stay here for long, though.

726
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:58,437
What if someone finds out
that I hid a runaway student?

727
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:00,022
I'm scared of Commissioner Wi.

728
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:05,694
(breathes deeply)

729
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:08,072
Also,

730
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:11,575
don't blame your father too much.

731
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:14,286
He must have his reasons.

732
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:16,372
If he hadn't told you what they were,

733
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:18,874
there must be reasons for that too.

734
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:22,002
UGON: It could have been for your sake.

735
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:26,841
So you don't have to live your life
feeling guilty.

736
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:29,927
(somber music)

737
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:30,928
(breathes deeply)

738
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:33,681
There's ointment somewhere in that drawer.

739
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:35,850
Put some on before sleeping.

740
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:40,187
(door closes)

741
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:45,776
(somber music continues)

742
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:50,656
(sighs)

743
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:56,203
(music fades)

744
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:03,878
ARI: All right. Let's all stand in line
and go to the Forensic Science Lab.

745
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:04,879
-STUDENTS: Yes, ma'am.
-ARI: All right.

746
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:06,380
BUMJU: Please come this way.

747
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,800
(birds chirping)

748
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:15,931
Hey, Eunkang.
Is Seunghyun not answering you either?

749
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:17,808
No. His phone's still off.

750
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:18,934
-(sighs)
-(phone beeps)

751
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:22,062
-Maybe we should call his home.
-His home?

752
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:27,359
Guys. Come on. We're about to start.

753
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:28,777
-EUNKANG: Okay. Coming.
-TAK: All right.

754
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:32,907
While DNA analysis is
relatively a new investigation method,

755
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:36,076
fingerprint analysis is
the most basic forensic analysis method

756
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,578
been in use for over a century.

757
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:42,249
Today, we're going to detect fingerprints

758
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:48,339
using this carbon-based black powder
called fingerprint powder.

759
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:53,886
-Can it be any fingerprint?
-UGON: Of course.

760
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:57,306
You can dust for any fingerprint
you can find in this room.

761
00:41:57,973 --> 00:42:00,726
UGON: You may think there will be
many fingerprints here,

762
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:03,812
but it won't be that easy
to find clear fingerprints.

763
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,482
Let's begin.

764
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:11,654
(indistinct chattering)

765
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:14,615
(thrilling music)

766
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:16,534
Dust wherever you think
fingerprints could be.

767
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:18,953
Do you see the fingerprints?

768
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:20,162
(students exclaiming)

769
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:27,503
Stick it on and off,
then the fingerprints are caught here.

770
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:30,506
-Stick the tape here and see how it goes.
-Okay.

771
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:33,592
HISTORY OF CRIME SCENE
INVESTIGATION IN KOREA

772
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:39,640
Could you shine here?

773
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:42,226
-It's coming up.
-I see it.

774
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,395
-This is so cool.
-It really works.

775
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:45,854
We got it.

776
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:48,482
All right. Did you all get fingerprints?

777
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,317
-STUDENTS: Yes.
-Let's check Group One first.

778
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:53,195
We detected a fingerprint on this baton.

779
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:54,780
Mm-hm.

780
00:42:58,576 --> 00:42:59,827
-(grunts)
-(Bumju groans)

781
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:06,250
(Ugon exclaims)

782
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:09,795
We found a fingerprint on this table.

783
00:43:09,878 --> 00:43:11,797
-BUMJU: Hey, wait.
-ARI: Try patting his back.

784
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:16,093
ARI: Oh, no. Maybe we should call
an ambulance.

785
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:17,511
(Ugon laughs)
Well done.

786
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,388
There aren't as many fingerprints
as you thought, right?

787
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:20,306
FEMALE STUDENT 1: No.

788
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:23,601
We found a fingerprint on this door.

789
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:26,437
It must have been hard
because so many people touch the doorknob.

790
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:28,814
It wasn't on the doorknob but the door.

791
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:38,991
UGON: Oh...

792
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:40,576
It's very clear.

793
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:42,369
There's another one.

794
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:51,253
UGON: Hmm?

795
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,715
I wonder why
there are fingerprints like that.

796
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:57,926
We also thought it was weird,
so we tried to guess what happened.

797
00:43:58,552 --> 00:43:59,928
And we concluded that

798
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:02,431
there had been
some displays of affection here.

799
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:05,017
(students clamoring)

800
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:06,143
UGON: Quiet down.

801
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:08,270
(students clamoring continues)

802
00:44:11,106 --> 00:44:12,149
And why is that?

803
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:15,361
As you can see, there's one palm on top

804
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:17,196
and two palms on bottom.

805
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:19,907
We have clear fingerprints
of two people here.

806
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:22,326
And considering
where the palms are located...

807
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:28,415
FINGERPRINTS

808
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:33,879
FEMALE STUDENT 1: Presumably,
the man's height is over 180cm

809
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:37,424
and the woman's between 160 and 165cm.

810
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,143
If we check the footprints on the floor,

811
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:51,647
we'll be able to confirm
what their positions were like.

812
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:54,400
(chuckling)
May I?

813
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:01,156
(quirky music)

814
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:08,997
-MALE STUDENT 1: She was right.
-There really are footprints.

815
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:11,166
-MALES STUDENT 2: My gosh.
-FEMALES STUDENT 2: What?

816
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:12,793
Enough.

817
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:16,004
UGON: That was a great theory.

818
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:17,965
You're very creative.

819
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:23,470
I think I know whose they are.
Can I say who?

820
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:26,557
No. Let's wrap it up here.

821
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:30,144
Finding the couple isn't our lesson today.

822
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:33,063
UGON: All right. Good job, everyone.
That's it for today.

823
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:34,148
And you.

824
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:37,943
You should apply to our school later.

825
00:45:38,026 --> 00:45:40,571
-Okay!
-UGON: Good job, everyone.

826
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:41,530
Thank you.

827
00:45:41,613 --> 00:45:42,656
STUDENTS: Thank you.

828
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:45,617
-Where is it?
-Is it real?

829
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:46,702
Lemme see.

830
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,664
JUYOUNG: Who was it?

831
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:54,543
What?

832
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:56,712
(exhales sharply)

833
00:45:57,337 --> 00:45:58,547
It's one of us.

834
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:02,092
Who would do such a...

835
00:46:02,634 --> 00:46:03,469
(sighs)

836
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:06,388
(smack lips)
It's too embarrassing to even say it.

837
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:09,641
Who did such a nasty thing
in this holy place?

838
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:14,396
Gosh. Hey.
Do you actually believe that kid?

839
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,065
I don't necessarily believe her,
but I believe in science.

840
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:20,569
What is the skin secretion
that mainly leaves fingerprints?

841
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:23,113
-Moisture.
-Exactly. Moisture.

842
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:27,284
Moisture, inorganic compounds like
sodium chloride, potassium, and calcium,

843
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:29,077
organic compounds
like amino acid and urea,

844
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:31,163
and sebum produced
in the sebaceous glands.

845
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:33,499
(Juyoung clears throat)
Anyway,

846
00:46:33,832 --> 00:46:36,752
that we had such clear fingerprints

847
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:40,005
means those fingerprints
didn't dry up yet.

848
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:41,548
Which means, they were still moist.

849
00:46:42,007 --> 00:46:43,091
Isn't that right?

850
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:48,055
Look. This room has been locked
for over a month during the vacation,

851
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:50,015
and there were wet fingerprints here?

852
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:54,228
This means that they belonged
to one of the people

853
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:57,064
who visited here within the past two days.

854
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:00,776
Let me ask you once again. Who was it?

855
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:04,238
(comical music)

856
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:06,990
I'm not sure.

857
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:09,451
I wonder who it was.

858
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:12,412
(Juyoung breathes deeply)

859
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:24,675
I might have seen someone...

860
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:30,931
(comical music rises)

861
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:34,101
It was me.

862
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:40,107
I'm the guy who touched the door.

863
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:42,025
TAK: Are you happy now?

864
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:44,862
(clears throat)
What? You?

865
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:47,197
Then who was the girl...

866
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:51,451
(groans)

867
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:54,204
My gosh. My blood pressure...

868
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:56,582
Wow. How could you betray us like this?

869
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,251
Wait. Was it really you guys?

870
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:04,506
-Sorry.
-Hey, Shin Ari.

871
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:05,924
You said you didn't like country boys.

872
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:08,176
JUYOUNG: You said Tak had broad shoulders
but he looked so dumb...

873
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,887
Gosh. What are you talking about?

874
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:11,680
-When did I say that?
-Hey!

875
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:13,849
Bring Eunkang here. She heard it all.

876
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:16,602
SOOKJA: Seunghyun is at school.

877
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:19,813
He went to school, saying he has to help
with the Police Academy or something.

878
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:21,523
Oh.

879
00:48:22,524 --> 00:48:24,818
He's probably busy and not picking up.

880
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:26,528
Is something the matter?

881
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:28,780
No, everything is all right.

882
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:30,949
Yes.

883
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:32,242
Bye.

884
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:33,911
Okay.

885
00:48:35,787 --> 00:48:37,623
-(phone beeps)
-(sighs)

886
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:41,668
Where on earth did he go?
Why doesn't he pick up the phone?

887
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:44,338
EUNKANG: Professor.

888
00:48:45,547 --> 00:48:46,673
Oh, hey.

889
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:50,761
Well...

890
00:48:51,637 --> 00:48:53,764
When you can't reach someone
for more than one day,

891
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:55,140
you can report them missing, right?

892
00:48:55,223 --> 00:48:56,350
If the person is an adult,

893
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:58,977
you should check if they went missing
on their own accord.

894
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:01,855
If they're over 18,
they'll be reported as a runaway.

895
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:04,191
Why? Who's out of contact?

896
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:05,317
Well...

897
00:49:07,694 --> 00:49:10,447
Actually, I can't reach Seunghyun.

898
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:12,366
(breathes)

899
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:15,243

900
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:16,495

901
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:20,999

904
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:45,148
(suspenseful tense music)

905
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:50,028
Please have a seat.

906
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:02,124
(sighs)

907
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:07,337
I was really surprised
to hear that you came.

908
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:09,715
So...

909
00:50:10,465 --> 00:50:11,925
what brings you here?

910
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:15,262
I'll ask you outright.

911
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:19,099
You got the laptop from my father, right?

912
00:50:19,474 --> 00:50:21,351
(scoffs)
Yes. So?

913
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:26,940
You can delete the video,
but my friends and I saw it.

914
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:29,192
You won't be able to get away.

915
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:31,278
My. I'm so scared.

916
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:35,323
(laughing)

917
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:37,284
You see, Seunghyun.

918
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:39,369
Don't think of me as your enemy.

919
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,329
HANSOL: We can be friends

920
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:45,042
or anything we want to be.

921
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:47,002
(Hansol breathes deeply)

922
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:50,338
(suspenseful music)

923
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:55,343
I like you, Seunghyun.

924
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:58,388
Can't we... be on the same team?

925
00:50:58,472 --> 00:51:01,016
I can't be on the same team as a criminal.

926
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:04,061
SEUNGHYUN: If you have committed a crime,

927
00:51:04,352 --> 00:51:05,896
I will make you pay for it.

928
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:09,232
I came here to say that.

929
00:51:15,113 --> 00:51:15,989
(snickers)

930
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:17,741
How adorable.

931
00:51:24,706 --> 00:51:26,416
-Have you looked into it?
-Yes, sir.

932
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:38,220
BROTHER, KIM HYUNSOO,
DIED IN A CAR ACCIDENT

933
00:51:38,303 --> 00:51:39,638
This looks interesting.

934
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:41,807
(ominous music)

935
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:43,350
(door chimes open)

936
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:47,020

EUISEOK: If you want to know
about Kim Hyunsoo's death,

939
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:56,071
come to Alto at 8 o'clock.

940
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:02,911

946
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:51,459
SEUNGHYUN: I didn't know
your brother was a KNPU student too.

947
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:52,878
Which class was he in?

948
00:52:52,961 --> 00:52:54,379
Kim Hyunsoo of the 33rd.

949
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:56,923

(door opens)

952
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:11,980
You're back.

953
00:53:18,236 --> 00:53:19,154
SEUNGHYUN: Professor.

954
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:20,947
Who's Kim Hyunsoo?

955
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:25,702
Is he Tak's brother?

958
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:56,524
Have a seat.

959
00:54:01,529 --> 00:54:03,406
(muffled upbeat music plays)

960
00:54:04,866 --> 00:54:05,700
(door closes)

961
00:54:12,457 --> 00:54:13,917
You know who I am, right?

962
00:54:15,293 --> 00:54:17,671
-Yes.
-I just learned

963
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:21,424
that you were Mr. Kim Hyunsoo's brother.

964
00:54:23,551 --> 00:54:26,680
-If I had known, we...
-How do you know my brother?

965
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:28,556
How could I not?

966
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:31,393
He used to work here in my club.

967
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:35,939
You didn't know?

968
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:39,776
You know,
he was like that thing in the movie.

969
00:54:39,859 --> 00:54:40,735
What's it called?

970
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:42,529
An undercover cop!

971
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:44,406
That's what he was.

972
00:54:44,489 --> 00:54:45,573
(thrilling music)

973
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:46,658
My brother?

974
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:49,411
(exclaiming)

975
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:57,377
You think...

976
00:54:57,877 --> 00:54:59,963
your brother died
in a car accident, don't you?

977
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:04,384
If not,

978
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:06,886
what was it?

979
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:09,889
(thrilling music continues)

980
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:15,270
Tak doesn't know...

981
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:18,523
that his brother died in the line of duty.

982
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:21,901
Does my father know...
(sniffles)

983
00:55:23,611 --> 00:55:25,655
...that Kim Hyunsoo is Tak's brother?

984
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:26,781
(inhales)

985
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:29,451
Maybe.

987
