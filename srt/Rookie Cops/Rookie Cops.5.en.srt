1
00:00:00,917 --> 00:00:03,211
(military march music)

2
00:00:12,303 --> 00:00:15,473
EUNKANG: The human emotion
that is most likely to be exaggerated

3
00:00:16,307 --> 00:00:17,434
is first love.

4
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:18,685
(reflective music)

5
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:21,521
In the movies,
it's described as such a precious feeling,

6
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:24,607
but in fact,
it's just a momentary crush you have

7
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,151
when you're young and naive.

8
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:27,819
Attention!

9
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:30,447
Student squad,
reporting for the student march.

10
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,448
WOOYONG: Salute!

11
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:34,617
EUNKANG: So I'm not sad nor depressed.

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,162
That's for idiots.

13
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:39,539
Student Squad One. 88 present.
Ready to march!

14
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:41,916
Student Squad Two. 88 present.
Ready to march!

15
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,377
Student Squad Three. 88 present.
Ready to march!

16
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,005
Student Squad Four. 88 present.
Ready to march!

17
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,716
Student Squad Five. 48 present.
Ready to march!

18
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:50,842
STUDENT SQUADS: Salute!

19
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:52,594
Salute!

20
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:56,556
A man is definitely not
what I need right now.

21
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:58,433
Chief of Education Corps, step forward.

22
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:03,646
Honor Pledge.

23
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,398
STUDENTS: Honor Pledge.

24
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:07,275
I affirm that I will be an honest...

25
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:09,736
STUDENTS: I affirm
that I will be an honest...

26
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:11,321
SUNYU: ...and honorable KNPU student...

27
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:13,198
STUDENTS: ...and honorable KNPU student...

28
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:14,699
SUNYU: ...who will not give in
to injustice.

29
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:16,576
STUDENTS: ...who will not give in
to injustice.

30
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:20,622
EUNKANG: I want to become
a confident modern woman

31
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:22,707
with great professional knowledge.

32
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:24,709
INSIK: One.

33
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,628
Two.

34
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:28,505
Three.

35
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:30,507
Four.

36
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:35,261
One, two, three, four.

37
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:39,766
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.

38
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:40,809
One.

39
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:42,560
Two.

40
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:45,522
EUNKANG: I, Ko Eunkang,

41
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,525
will completely move on from my first love

42
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:51,236
and become a brand new person.

43
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:54,989
Though I may have started from the bottom,

44
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,658
I will reach the top.

45
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:58,618
I will keep moving forward.

46
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,414
(uplifting music)

47
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:10,505
(theme music)

48
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,428
EPISODE 5

49
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:18,972
EUNKANG: How to move on
from your first crush.

50
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:19,889
Number one.

51
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,976
Out of sight, out of mind.

52
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:27,105
Quit the club you joined to see him.

53
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,148
Well...

54
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:32,110
It makes me feel bad too.

55
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:36,406
But I thought I should rather focus
on my studies.

56
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:39,117
EUNKANG: I'll come back next year
if I can.

57
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,118
I'm sorry.

58
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,369
JUCHAN: Eunkang.

59
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:46,708
(clears throat)

60
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,501
Hi, Juchan.
(chuckles)

61
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:49,419
You're early.

62
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,045
Yes, the thing is,

63
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,173
I have something to tell you. I...

64
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,009
-Thank you, Eunkang.
-What?

65
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,178
To be honest, I was a bit worried.

66
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:00,930
I thought you might quit the club
because you feel awkward around me.

67
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:04,350
JUCHAN: But I guess
I didn't have to worry at all.

68
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:07,061
I mean, you're the first one to show up,
and you even said hi to me.

69
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,772
-You're so cool, Eunkang.
-Well...

70
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,859
-I...
-JUCHAN: Don't worry.

71
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,695
I'll treat you the same as before.
You don't need to feel awkward.

72
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,406
I'm not that inconsiderate.

73
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:19,365
(chuckles awkwardly)

74
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,451
Of course you're not. But I...

75
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:22,368
Let's get inside.

76
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:23,286
Uh...

77
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:26,080
(quirky music)

78
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:31,628
Okay.
(chuckles)

KNPU JUJITSU CLUB

80
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,388
(thumping)

81
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:50,897
-(thuds)
-(grunts)

82
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:54,150
(dreamy music)

83
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:01,407
(grunting)

84
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:08,164
SENIOR STUDENT 1: Sir, don't you think
you're a little showy today?

85
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:11,251
SENIOR STUDENT 2: You must be trying
to impress the newcomers.

86
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,835
JUCHAN: I was just doing it like usual.

87
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,463
-SENIOR STUDENTS: No way.
-SENIOR STUDENT 2: No, you weren't.

88
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:17,131
(clears throat)

89
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:18,383
Anyway,

90
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:21,678
eight freshmen joined
our jujitsu club this year.

91
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,764
Last year, we didn't have
any new female members,

92
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,892
-but we have two this year.
-SENIOR STUDENT 3: Yes!

93
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,352
(applause)

94
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:34,399
Please be extra nice to them
so they don't feel excluded. Understood?

95
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:35,400
SENIOR STUDENTS: Yes!

96
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:36,859
SENIOR STUDENTS: Welcome, juniors!

97
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,486
SENIOR STUDENTS: We love you, juniors!

98
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:40,530
SENIOR STUDENTS: We hope we get along.

99
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:45,868
All right. The best thing about jujitsu.

100
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:49,789
is that you can overpower someone
bigger than you by using techniques.

101
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:52,041
JUCHAN: For women,
it can be a great self-defense skill.

102
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,710
It can also help you

103
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,296
overpower violent or drunk people
later when you're in the field.

104
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:58,756
(Juyoung humming)

105
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,218
(Juyoung munching)

106
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,348
(cellphone chimes)

107
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:11,894
(scoffs)

108
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:15,732
Hey, Juyoung.
What are you doing on the weekend?

109
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:18,484
JUYOUNG: Going to Mokpo. My big brother
is coming on his last military leave.

110
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:19,819
Oh, do you have to go?

111
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:22,405
I haven't seen him
for two years since he enlisted.

112
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:25,241
I mean, he's my brother.
I should at least see if he's still alive.

113
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:26,993
(sighs)
Is that so?

114
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:27,910
(clicks tongue)

115
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:29,662
That's too bad.

116
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:31,581
JUYOUNG: Why?

117
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,126
There's this friend
I met in an academy in high school,

118
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:37,045
and asked me if I'd like to go
on a blind date this weekend.

119
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,254
My gosh!

120
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,964
Oh, my. Ms. Shin!

121
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:44,552
That is so sweet of you!
Hey, you're a real friend. A true friend.

122
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:46,721
-You said you're going home.
-(sucks teeth)

123
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:49,057
First things first.

124
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:51,684
When it comes to family,
no news is good news.

125
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:53,603
(both chuckle)

126
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,021
He's a little old, though.

127
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:57,106
-He's four years older than us.
-My gosh.

128
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,983
They say four years is the best age gap.

129
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,111
We're so meant to be.
I can feel it already.

130
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:03,154
(laughs)

131
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:05,114
Okay. Then I'll say yes.

132
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,282
Okay. Good.

133
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:10,703
I should tell Eunkang
about this good news.

134
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:13,706
JUCHAN: When you do the shoulder throw,

135
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,167
hold the collars with your hands crossed,
then instantly...

136
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,170
(senior student 1 groans)

137
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,089
Perform techniques

138
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:24,008
so your opponent cannot get out.
This is the important part.

139
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:26,344
Juchan is so good, isn't he?

140
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,262
It's all choreographed.

141
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:31,557
No, it's not. Look. He's actually in pain.

142
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,267
-(grunts)
-(thumping)

143
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:41,651
JUCHAN (exhales sharply):
Does anyone want to try it?

144
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:44,612
The more you practice,
the faster you'll improve.

145
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:46,364
So try it while you have the chance.

146
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,033
No one?

147
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,828
Nobody wants to do it
because they're scared.

148
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:52,787
(chuckles)

149
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:57,542
-What?
-I'd like to try.

150
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,419

GRABBING COLLARS, GROWING LOVE
KNPU JUJITSU CLUB

152
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:03,005
All right. Come on out, Seunghyun.

153
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:04,507
Hey.

154
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,345
(upbeat music continues)

155
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:13,641
I'll demonstrate first.
Watch me and copy my moves. Okay?

156
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:14,725
Okay.

157
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:22,942
(class murmuring)

158
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,485
-What is he doing?
-(Juchan grunts)

00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:48,843
(whispers)
Hey, tap out.

165
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,889
(Seunghyun grunting)

166
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,223
Tap out!

167
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,516
What's wrong with him?

168
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,899
(upbeat music)

169
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:05,651
Hey.

170
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:07,570
Hey!

171
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,614
(crickets creaking)

172
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:15,578
See? This is what happens
when you act out like that.

173
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:18,956
If Juchan hadn't gone easy on you,
you could have been in big trouble.

174
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,917
Easy? He was quite struggling too.

175
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,251
Struggling?
(laughs)

176
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,504
Hey! You were no match for him.

177
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,797
Juchan is really good at sports.

178
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,341
He's literally good at all sports.

179
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:30,801
Martial arts, kendo, tennis...

180
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:33,554
He runs a half marathon
and does a triathlon every year.

181
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,181
I'm good at sports too.

182
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:37,350
Soccer, swimming...

183
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:40,436
I can swim freestyle, breaststroke,
backstroke, and butterfly stroke.

184
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,523
I can do taekwondo too. I won first place
at a competition when I was a kid.

185
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,274
-Ahri set us up a group blind date
-I can do basketball too.

186
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,651
Really? When is it?

187
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:48,486
-When it comes to basketball,
-This weekend. Are you free?

188
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:49,654
-SEUNGHYUN: I could go pro.
-Okay.

189
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:51,697
I had to avoid the coach for one year...

190
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:53,699
-What are you doing?
-What?

191
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,035
Right. What sports did you do?

192
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:56,994
Never mind.

193
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:59,121
-What did you do? Tell me again.
-Forget it.

194
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,123
-Come on. Tell me.
-I said forget it.

195
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,625
-Come on and tell me.
-Never mind.

196
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,502
-(emotive music)
-So...

197
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,879
have you come to your senses?

198
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:11,717
Well, if you're asking
if I decided to stay in school...

199
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:16,764
But if you're asking
if I want to be a cop, I'm not sure.

200
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:19,058
-Still?
-What do you mean by, "still"?

201
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:22,895
Before you get double eyelid surgery,
there's so much to think about.

202
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:25,356
"Would it suit me? Should I get it?"

203
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:29,110
You'd spend the whole night flipping
your eyelids inside out repetitively.

204
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:31,404
And you'd read at least 100 reviews
on the surgeons.

205
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:35,491
-I haven't done it, so...
-I didn't either.

206
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,619
Anyway, even getting double eyelid surgery
is not an easy decision to make.

207
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:41,205
Not to mention
a major life decision like this.

208
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:45,710
I'll take my time thinking about it
while studying here.

209
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,049
Why aren't you saying anything?

210
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,761
-What?
-You know, the nagging.

211
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:59,181
Things like, that I'm such an opportunist,
I'm not qualified here,

212
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,725
or I might as well just quit already.

213
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:01,809
That's not true.

214
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:06,397
I think you're more qualified here
than anyone else.

215
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:08,983
You know how to protect yourself.

216
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:12,445
That's why you don't give up
or break down easily.

217
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:16,949
Only people like that
can protect other people.

218
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,327
(emotive music continues)

219
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,911
Take all the time you need.

220
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:22,580
Who cares what others say?

221
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:26,000
It's your life. You're the one
who should worry about it.

222
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,127
(chuckles softly)

223
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,256
(crickets creaking)

224
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,092
Wow, the flowers are blooming.

225
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,846
EUNKANG (gasps):
I guess spring really has come.

226
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,098
You know what?

227
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,560
They say the magnolia
is the most desperate flower of all.

228
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:50,149
Because it stays on the branch
until its petals are all withered.

229
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,360
It's kind of...

230
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:53,486
(breathes deeply)

231
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:55,112
...touching.

232
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:59,408
-Hey, could you take a photo of me?
-What?

233
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:07,166
(dreamy rhythmic music)

234
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,383
-Done?
-What? Hold on.

235
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,301
(cellphone camera clicks)

236
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:19,720
EUNKANG: Let me see.

237
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:23,849
What is this?

238
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:27,395
My legs look so short.

239
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:31,440
My toes are supposed to be
on the bottom of the photo.

240
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,025
So my legs look longer.

241
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,402
Don't you know that?

242
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:36,070
Really?

243
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:38,322
(sighs)
It's common sense.

244
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,408
Body proportion matters so much to women.

245
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,660
Haven't you ever taken photos
for your girlfriend?

246
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:43,744
No.

247
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:45,788
(in English) Sorry.

248
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:48,416
(in Korean)
I didn't know you never had a girlfriend.

249
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,835
It doesn't mean I never had one.

250
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:54,088
-You had one?
-(in English) No comment.

251
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:57,174
(in Korean)
My. I guess you were a cool nerd.

252
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,802
-Give it. Let me take another one.
-Forget it.

253
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,721
-Come on. I'll take another one.
-EUNKANG: It's okay.

254
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,764
-SEUNGHYUN: I can do better this time.
-EUNKANG: Never mind.

255
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,852
FEMALE STUDENT (grunts): You know what?

256
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:09,979
Gi Hanna talked to me
at the cafeteria earlier.

257
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,063
FEMALE STUDENT 2: Really?

258
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,107
-She asked me if she could sit next to me.
-FEMALE STUDENT 2: No way! And?

259
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:16,861
-I said she could. Then I left the table.
-Why did you do that?

260
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:18,571
She probably wanted
to be friends with you.

261
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:20,614
Whatever. She's just acting friendly
because she has no one

262
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,825
-to do the team project with.
-I hate her.

263
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,410
FEMALE STUDENT 1: She's so annoying.

264
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:27,705
(cellphone buzzing)

265
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,711
There will be four guys.
Who else should we bring?

266
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:35,796
Are you crazy?

267
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:41,802
Well, you said we needed one more girl.
We have to match up pairs.

268
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:45,222
But we can't bring Gi Hanna.
You hate her too.

269
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,475
That's true.

270
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:52,271
But we can't be like this forever.
There aren't many girls here.

271
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:54,565
(inhales)
Besides, she seems so down lately.

272
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:57,985
She's right. She's been eating alone
for a month now. I feel a bit bad for her.

273
00:12:58,068 --> 00:12:59,987
Still, I can't bring her. I don't want to.

274
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:03,532
-Then who else?
-There's Semi. And there's Soojung too.

275
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:05,993
I think Soojung's busy this weekend.

276
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:07,620
She's going to her sister's wedding.

277
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:08,746
And Semi has a boyfriend.

278
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:09,830
Then...

279
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,959
Youngji. You know,
the tall girl with glasses.

280
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,128
-Maybe I should ask her.
-Lee Youngji?

281
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,422
I've never talked to her before.

282
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:19,381
Me neither.

283
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,051
I don't want to go on a blind date
with someone I don't really know.

284
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,637
-It's going to be so awkward.
-Right.

285
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,598
At least we once shared a room with Hanna.

286
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:29,809
But Hanna is...

287
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:32,144
(awkward music sting)

288
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:34,980
Whatever!

289
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,148
(grumbles)

290
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,567
-(Eunkang chuckles)
-ARI: Hmph!

291
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,694
She's like a huge worm.
(chuckles)

292
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,157
(door chimes)

293
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,795
(quirky music)

294
00:13:58,546 --> 00:13:59,755
Are you busy?

295
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,512
I was wondering
if you're free this weekend.

296
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:08,556
Why?

297
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,183
If you're not busy,
do you want to go on a group blind date?

298
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:14,812
Well, Ari, Juyoung, and I are

299
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:17,314
going on a group blind date,
and we're supposed to be four.

300
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:20,401
If you have nothing to do,
you can join us.

301
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:22,486
-We can eat together and...
-I'm good.

302
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,696
(wheels rattle)

303
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:26,699
(inhales)
You see,

304
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:30,244
you have to eat with other people
and go on blind dates together

305
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:31,996
if you want to be friends with them.

306
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:34,456
You can't be on your own forever.

307
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,625
I don't have any intentions
of being friends with you.

308
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,002
What?

309
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,590
I don't want to be friends with you.

310
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:43,966
(scoffs)

311
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,968
How could you say that?

312
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,511
I was just worried about you.

313
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:49,013
Why would you?

314
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:51,098
-Who do you think you are?
-What?

315
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:52,391
HANNA: Get over yourself.

316
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:55,603
It seems like you feel superior to me
after stopping me from being expelled.

317
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,022
But you know what? It's really annoying.

318
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,150
I can take care of my own social life.

319
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:03,152
So mind your own business.

320
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:09,783
(dramatic music)

321
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:12,077
(paper rifles)

322
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:14,830
(sighs)
I told you!

323
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,916
Hanna's hopeless!

324
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:20,336
I'm actually glad it turned out like this.
We can do it, just the three of us.

325
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:21,420
It's okay...

326
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,549
(whispers)
I'll call you back.

327
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:28,177
-(phone chimes)
-(door closes)

328
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:31,013
-Hello, sir.
-Hey, Shin Ari.

329
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:34,975
Did you place
the school souvenirs order correctly?

330
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:39,605
Yes. I ordered the hats, the badges,
and the T-shirts. 200 each...

331
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:42,316
-Are you sure?
-Pardon?

332
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:44,318
Do you even check the receipt?

333
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:46,737
What?

334
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,323
RECEIPT
BILL TO MS. SHIN ARI

335
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:51,116
HAT: 200, BADGE: 200, T-SHIRT: 20

336
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:52,076
(gasps)

337
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,370
I'm so sorry.
(gasps)

338
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,246
I'll call the company right away.

339
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,790
WOOYONG: Never mind. Just leave it.

340
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,918
Hyunseok took care of it,
so just leave it.

341
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,380
(sighs)
I'm sorry.

342
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:07,716
There will be 40 visitors tomorrow
coming on a field trip.

343
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,718
Are we giving the T-shirts
to only half of them?

344
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,513
And you didn't even answer my call
after messing this all up.

345
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:14,181
WOOYONG: Do you think this is a joke?

346
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:15,474
I'm sorry, sir.

347
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:18,352
Wooyong, can you go
to the Student Council's office?

348
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,020
Pardon?

349
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:22,648
They're making a Q&A video
for YouTube about college life,

350
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:24,400
and they're asking if we've got any ideas.

351
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,735
-Go check it out.
-Yes, I will.

352
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:36,537
(door opens)

353
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:39,957
(door closes)

354
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,337
Are you going to keep standing there?

355
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:53,846
(sighs)

356
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:57,016
The reason why Wooyong is mad
isn't because he hates you.

357
00:16:57,266 --> 00:17:00,019
It's because your mistake can be
seen as the school's mistake.

358
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:03,063
The Promotion Corps represents
the school. So we should be careful.

359
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,356
I'll be more careful, sir.

360
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,985
Cheer up. Don't let him down.

361
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:10,237
Okay.

362
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,450
(keyboard clacking)

363
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,994
-(mouse clicking)
-(keyboard clacking)

364
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:21,123
HAT: 200, BADGE: 200, T-SHIRT: 200

365
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:23,125
What? The order is right.

366
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,629
I think it was the company's mistake.

367
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,549
I did order 200 each.
I should check what happened.

368
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:32,092
Don't bother. I reordered it already.

369
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:34,428
But we should make it clear
whose mistake it was.

370
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:35,763
So it doesn't happen again.

371
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:37,890
HYUNSEOK: We've done business
with them for a long time.

372
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:40,893
Let's not make things complicated.
I'll talk to them.

373
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:43,729
Let's go have lunch.

374
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:46,940
(suspenseful music)

375
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:47,941
Okay.

376
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:51,779
(door opens)

377
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:59,286
-MAN: Ugon.
-Hey.

378
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,460
(in English) Thank you. Thank you.

379
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:10,089
(in Korean) We haven't met in ages,
and this is what you ask for?

380
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,882
Man, I should cut ties with you.

381
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:13,050
Sorry about that.

382
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,677
You're the only one
I can actually talk to.

383
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:16,970
Only when you need me.

384
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:20,641
We're supposed to return spy cams
when a new model comes out,

385
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:22,059
but some of us didn't.

386
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:25,145
-Why?
-Who knows? Maybe they sold them.

387
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,272
(laughing)

388
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:30,734
Many of them are lost on duty.

389
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:33,737
And no one really cares
unless they're the latest models.

390
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:35,364
Though they should.

391
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,366
2010 RUSSIAN SPY CAM RETURN LIST

392
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:38,575
OH JOON, LOST WHILE ON DUTY
KIM SANGWOO, BROKEN WHILE ON DUTY

393
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,285
(indistinct chatter)

394
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:42,663
"Kang Namgi"?

395
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,206
(suspenseful music)

396
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:47,000
Let me introduce him. He's going to
help us with this operation.

397
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:49,378
He's Detective Kang Namgi
from Gangeun Police Station.

398
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,839
I heard a lot about you.

399
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:54,633
I'm Inspector Cha Ugon,
Drug Investigation Unit.

400
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,305
NAMGI: I've also heard about you.

401
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,351
(suspenseful music continues)

402
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:10,691
Right. I'm Kim Hyunsoo.

403
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,651
This is the guy.

404
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,070
I want you to give them
all the information

405
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:17,781
you've been collecting about the club.

406
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:20,993
Yes, sir.

407
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:24,413
GIYONG: Okay. Let's talk details
over some food.

408
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:26,915
MAN: Do you know him?

409
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:30,377
What? No.
It says his spy cam wasn't returned.

410
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,920
The reason is written there.

411
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,716
MAN: "Lost during relocation."

412
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:40,304
SOUTH GANGNEUNG STATION

413
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,141
NAME: GI HANNA

414
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,268
ADDRESS: GANGNEUNG, GANGWON PROVINCE

415

(suspenseful music continues)

416
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,405
MAN: He'd been transferred
here and there since getting demoted.

417
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:00,324
I heard he's in Gangneung now.
Why do you ask?

418
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:06,538
(suspenseful music)

419
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,375
Why does Hanna have...

420
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,836
Detective Kang's spy cam?

421
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:17,424
GYMNASIUM

422
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:19,426

00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:24,264
(panting)

424
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:29,394
(clanking)

425
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:38,612
(sighs)

426
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,948
(gasps, grumbles)

427
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,992
(breathes heavily)

428
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:48,664
KNPU, THE CRADLE OF GLOBAL TALENTS

429
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:51,083
(indistinct chatter)

430
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,838
I'm so nervous.
I've never been on a blind date before.

431
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,257
Gosh. Just count on me.

432
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,050
-JUYOUNG: Have you done this before?
-ARI: Of course.

433
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:01,927
-Hey. What...
-JUYOUNG: You're so wild.

434
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,263
I can't wait.

435
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:10,686
Who are you?

436
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:17,109
-Do I know you guys?
-Buzz off.

437
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:18,610
I do know you.

438
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:20,612
What's going on today?

439
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:23,115
Why are you so dolled up?
Where are you going...

440
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:25,617
What's going on today?

441
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,327
Sorry, guys!

442
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:30,372
(rapid footsteps)

443
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,043
(dreamy music)

444
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,302
(dreamy music continues)

445
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,182
EUNKANG: Sorry.

446
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,226
I had to change my stockings.

447
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,270
(quirky music sting)

448
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:54,521
JUYOUNG: Hey.

449
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:56,023
Stop staring.

450
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:58,191
-Let's go.
-Okay.

451
00:21:58,275 --> 00:21:59,484
ARI: Let's go.

452
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:03,488
(quirky music continues)

453
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:11,705
What was that?

454
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,624
-SEUNGHYUN: A group blind date?
-BUMJU: Yes.

455
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,168
BUMJU: They're meeting in Apgujeong.

456
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:17,586
Juyoung said so.

457
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:19,796
That's why they looked so excited.

458
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,173
With whom?

459
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,509
-I don't know.
-DAEIL: You know what? Let them go.

460
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,970
They should meet other guys too.
So they can realize...

461
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:27,888
(exhales)

462
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:30,682
...how charming and good-looking
their colleagues are.

463
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:31,725
(Daeil chuckles)

464
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:35,896
By the way, didn't they seem different
all dressed up like that?

465
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,732
I mean, I've only seen them
in ponytails with cruddy eyes.

466
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:39,858
I was really surprised.

467
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:41,943
They even put on perfume.

468
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:45,280
-Not sure. I couldn't really tell.
-DAEIL: You must have a bad sinus.

469
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:48,658
You're so inattentive.
This is why girls don't like you.

470
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:53,580
You need to spot a girl's transformation
to be able to date one.

471
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:56,583
Worry about yourself.
He is doing much better than you.

472
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,877
He's doing better than me?

473
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,588
Is this because of the text?

474
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:05,258
I told you. It was sent to me.

475
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:07,344
Gosh. I can't believe this.

476
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:09,221
Hey, Bumju. Check this out.

477
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:10,972
Look at this. Here.

478
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:13,809
-(Daeil clears throat)
-I hope you're doing well.

479
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,894
It's spring and the weather is so nice.

480
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:17,437
It reminded me of you.

481
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,399
When will you invite me to your school?

482
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:21,983
She's asking me out, right?

483
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,944
-Is this the girl you met last time?
-Yeah.

484
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:25,529
There's more under that.

485
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:27,697
(breathes deeply)

486
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:30,075
P.S. I hope Seunghyun is doing well too.

487
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:32,202
I followed him.
I wonder if he'll follow me back.

488
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:33,995
Let's have a drink together sometime.

489
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,289
She's just being polite here.

490
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:40,293
I heard girls use P.S.
to show what they really want to say.

491
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:42,087
Who... Who said that?

492
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,089
My sisters.

493
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:46,091
Gosh. This is frustrating.

494
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:48,093
She's just trying to be polite there.

495
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:50,303
If she's interested in Seunghyun,
why would she text me?

496
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:51,638
She has his number too.

497
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:53,890
-Did you get her text?
-No.

498
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:54,975
(table thuds)

499
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:58,937
Gosh! You...
You don't know anything, do you?

500
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,648
Even Bumju and I know. Why don't you?

501
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:04,234
Girls talk to the guys

502
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:06,736
next to the guys
they're actually interested in.

503
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,822
You're just a stepping stone.

504
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:10,991
What? A stepping stone?

505
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,452
Are you serious?

506
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:14,578
(sighs)

507
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:16,371
See you guys later. I've got to go.

508
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:17,497
Already?

509
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:19,958
DAEIL (screaming): Where are you going?

510
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,002
To do laundry.

511
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:27,299
-Why?
-Good luck with that.

512
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:28,592
(sucks teeth)

513
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:30,677
(crockery clinks)

514
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:34,014
He built all those muscles
just to do laundry.

515
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:35,974
What a thick skull. Seriously.

516
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,437
That's what you use your muscles for.

517
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,938
-Right.
-For sure.

518
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:43,982
(mysterious music)

519
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:50,197
DAEIL: Gosh,
I'm going to kill him one day.

520
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,449
What am I going to do with him?
I'm even older than him.

521
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:53,658
Eat up.

522
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,578
I'm the one she asked out.

523
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:57,954
BUMJU: I don't think so.

524
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,959
(quirky music)

525
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:09,799
(group laughing)

526
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:12,761
GUY 1: Wow, that sounds tough.
It's practically the army.

527
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:16,306
One of my juniors joined the ROTC,
but this sounds way more extreme.

528
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:20,143
I think our food is better, though.
Our cafeteria has really good food.

529
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:22,437
That's true. I gained 3kg
since I entered the school.

530
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,356
And we run a lot.
(chuckles)

531
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:27,234
If the rules are so strict, I assume
you can't go to places like clubs.

532
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:29,486
Well, we do secretly.

533
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:31,905
It's okay as long as
we stay out of trouble.

534
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:32,864
"Trouble"?

535
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:36,117
Well, getting into a fight
and beating up someone or...

536
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,286
-Drunk driving.
-Yes, something like that.

537
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,956
If we end up in a police station,
our school finds out right away.

538
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,082
Through a background check.

539
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:45,877
Two years ago, I heard one of our seniors
got caught for drunk driving,

540
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:48,088
and he was expelled
only two months before graduation.

541
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:50,257
I guess we can't go drinking today then.

542
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,008
-Don't worry.
-Yes, we can.

543
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,802
-Don't worry about that.
-(groups laughing)

544
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:57,889
(group laughing continues)

545
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:02,018
(soft chuckle)

546
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:12,988
(clicks tongue, breathes heavily)

547
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:23,290
(romantic music playing)

548
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,251
This place is really nice.
(chuckles)

549
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:28,628
I'm glad you like it.

550
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,590
It was my friend's recommendation.
He knows a lot of nice places.

551
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:34,259
He said I could make any girl
fall for me here.

552
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:36,177
(laughs)

553
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:39,514
(glass clinks)

554
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:44,436
(whirring)

555
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,605
WI SEUNGHYUN, KO EUNKANG

556
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:49,399
(sighs)

557
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:52,068
DAEIL: What are you doing?

558
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:59,534
This is Eunkang's.
Do you think I can have it?

559
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:01,703
(exhales)

560
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:03,163
Why do you ask me?

561
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:05,373
You should ask the owner.

562
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:06,833
You think?

563
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,587
-I should call her then.
-Okay.

564
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:17,093
You weren't talking much earlier,
so I thought you were in a bad mood.

565
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:18,511
Me?

566
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:21,473
You seemed a little down
since we were matched.

567
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:25,268
That's not true. I kept looking at you
because I wanted to be your partner.

568
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:27,187
(chuckles)
Really?

569
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:29,064
(Eunkang clears throat)

570
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:30,815
(cellphone buzzing)

571
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:34,110
-(objects clatters)
-(cellphone buzzing continues)

572
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:37,113
WI SEUNGHYUN

573
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:40,325
-You can take it.
-Okay, then...

574
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:42,494
-SEUNGHYUN: Hello?
-Hey. What is it?

575
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:45,038
Can I drink your milk?

576
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:47,707
(sighs)
Sure. You can drink it all. Is that it?

577
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:50,168
Is it still good? Maybe it's gone bad.

578
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:54,255
It's written there. Can't you see it?

579
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:55,298
Where?

580
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:57,592
Oh, it's here.

581
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:00,887
It's still good. I guess I can drink it.

582
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,972
It doesn't have
real bananas inside, does it?

583
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,433
-SEUNGHYUN: It's just the flavor...
-(cellphone beeps)

584
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:06,726
(Eunkang chuckles awkwardly)

585
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,395
Hello? Eunkang?

586
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,649
-(scoffs)
-That was my colleague.

587
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:13,775
It wasn't anything serious.

588
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:16,528
I'm sure there are
a lot of boys at school.

589
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:19,239
There aren't many girls,
so they must all be nice to you.

590
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:20,532
Not at all.

591
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:23,993
They don't see us in a romantic way.
And we don't either.

592
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:28,415
We know too much about each other.
We're just colleagues. That's it.

593
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:30,458
Is that so?

594
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:32,293
I see.

595
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:35,255
Here, try this.

596
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:38,216
(chuckles)

597
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:43,304
(quirky music)

598
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:45,974
It's tasty, right?

599
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:50,770
(munching)

600
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:55,525
Where are you going?

601
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:58,695
-To the cafeteria.
-Let's eat out. I'm feeling down.

602
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:02,115
(engine revving)

603
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:06,453
(Tak munching)

604
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:12,709
-TAK: Is there a problem?
-SEUNGHYUN: No.

605
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:14,252
TAK: Yes, you do.

606
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:16,004
No, I don't.

607
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,715
(Tak munching)

608
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,718
-(slams desk)
-SEUNGHYUN: Look. What does it mean

609
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:24,345
when a girl asks you
if you had a girlfriend before

610
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,347
and gets upset when you don't answer?

611
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:28,433
What does that mean?

612
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:31,728
-What?
-Doesn't it mean she's interested?

613
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:34,898
-I think so.
-But why...

614
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:36,983
(sighs)

615
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,569
Who is this girl that got you upset?

616
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:41,279
(exhales sharply)
Never mind.

617
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:42,238
(sighs)

618
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:44,365
(quirky music)

619
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:48,745
TAK: Hello!

620
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:49,704
SEUNGHYUN: Hello!

621
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:52,290
-Who are they?
-I'm KNPU freshman Wi Seunghyun.

622
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:53,875
I'm KNPU freshman Kim Tak.

623
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:56,669
WOOYONG: Is this okay?
I hope we're not making you uncomfortable.

624
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:58,004
-SEUNGHYUN: You're not, sir.
-TAK: It's okay, sir.

625
00:29:58,087 --> 00:30:00,173
HYUNSEOK: Hey. Of course
they'd say it's okay.

626
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:04,052
Just think of this as free dinner.

627
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:05,720
And feel free to order anything.

628
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,639
It's okay, sir. We're done.

629
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:09,474
Hey, Seunghyun.

630
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:11,851
When your senior is buying you food,
you should eat it even if you're full.

631
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:14,354
-I'm sorry.
-Hey, don't force them.

632
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:18,149
Then how about we grab a drink?

633
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:19,984
-Sounds good.
-Good.

634
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:23,655
-Let me fill your glass.
-Thanks.

635
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:26,699
Hey, drop the formalities.

636
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:29,702
Here, you can just call me casually.

637
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:32,747
Let's just be casual.
It'll make me feel comfortable too. Okay?

638
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:35,416
(quirky music)

639
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:38,461
WOOYONG: This is all because of you.

640
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:40,964
You must've been so mean
to the freshmen during Cheongram.

641
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:43,007
Hey. I was the nicest one.

642
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:45,927
Sunyu was so worried about me
saying I was too soft.

643
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,470
What? He thinks he's soft.
(chuckles)

644
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:49,722
HYUNSEOK: That's the funniest joke
I've heard from you.

645
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:51,766
-Gosh, but it's true.
-(laughing)

646
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:53,643
(laughs awkwardly)

647
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:55,270
INSIK: All right. Let's drink.

648
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:00,525
(both laugh awkwardly)

649
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:02,527
-INSIK: Let's have a toast.
-Thank you.

650
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:05,488
-HYUNSEOK: Wait. My glass is empty.
-Oh, right.

651
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:08,825
(quirky music continues)

652
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:12,412
-This chicken is a bit...
-I know, right?

653
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:14,998
BOTH: Thanks for the food.

654
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:16,958
All right. Have a good rest.

655
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,835
-Bye.
-We'll see you later.

656
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:24,215
(quirky music)

657
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:29,512
-Gosh! Whose idea was it to come here?
-Sorry.

658
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:31,347
I couldn't even swallow the soju.

659
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:33,224
(both sigh)

660
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:36,394
Let's digest the food before we go.

661
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,605
BILLIARD HALL

662
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:39,856
Let's go.

663
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:41,107
(sighs)

664
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:43,860
Wait. I left my phone.

665
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,445
-What?
-Darn it. Go ahead.

666
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:46,946
I'll catch up with you in a minute.

667
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:47,864
(sighs)

668
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:50,325
TAK: I don't want to go back in there.

669
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:52,869
BULLY 1: This looks nice.

670
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:54,162

(foreboding music)

674
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,505
Gosh. This is pathetic.

675
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:06,257
(cash register dings)

676
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,511
No. My boss will dock my pay for the loss.

677
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:11,554
Hm.

678
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:14,057
BULLY 1: Then call the police.

679
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:17,226
You know what's going to happen
to your brother, right?

680
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,103
(snickers)

681
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:21,189

(bully 1 exhales sharply)

683
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:25,777
Let's see...

684
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:29,405
(wind chimes tinkle)

685
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:32,325
(tense suspenseful music)

686
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:35,578
Oh. We're closed.

687
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:38,915
-Already?
-He said we're closed.

688
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:43,711
What a weirdo.

689
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:45,838
-(door closes)
-(wind chimes tinkle)

690

693
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:57,433
SEUNGHYUN: Excuse me.

694
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,686
-BULLY 2: Jeez...
-What is he?

695
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,607
We said we're closed.

696
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:08,069
Did you just push me?

697
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:09,028
Yes, I did.

698
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:10,947
-So what?
-(sighs)

699
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:12,448
Let's not use violence.

700
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,784
I see you're threatening
the part-timer here.

701
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:15,827
I'll call the police.

702
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,415
(scoffs)

703
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,916
Come on, boss.

704
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:26,212
I'm not supposed
to use violence right now.

705
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:29,215

707
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:32,844
BULLY 1: Hey.

708
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:34,679
Who are you?

709
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:37,306
-Tak. Don't touch them.
-Hey.

710
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:38,391
You punk!

711

-BULLY 2: You little...

Hey. Stop it.

729
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:53,508
I said, stop!

730
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:55,635
(bullies clamoring)

731
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,553
BULLY 1: Let's get out of here.

739
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:20,368
How's your hand? Are you hurt?

740
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,454
TAK: I'm all right.

741
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:27,583

-Pardon?

00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,401
I'm okay, sir.

746
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:56,154
I'm okay too, sir.

747
00:35:58,072 --> 00:35:59,782
-You should leave.
-Pardon?

748
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:01,784
You should get out of here now.

749
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:08,082
They won't just go away like that.
Soon, they'll come back with their gang.

750
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,961
Leave before this becomes a big fight.

751
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:13,754
I'll take care of it.

752
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:14,714
But...

753
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:17,800
Don't worry. I didn't see anything.

754
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:21,053
They seem to be bullies around here.

755
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:23,806
I'm sure you did this for a reason.

756
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:26,475
Sorry, sir.

757
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:27,643
Sorry, sir.

758
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:29,437
Come on. Go.

You idiots.

762
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:54,545
Get it together, all right?

763
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,130
SEUN BILLIARD HALL

764
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,049
I said you should keep a low profile

765
00:36:58,633 --> 00:36:59,967
in this neighborhood.

766
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:02,053
Remember?

767
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:06,057
We didn't know they were KNPU students.

768
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:09,727
I told you not to bully people
around here.

769
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:12,563
I don't want to look like
I hang out with some punks.

770
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:16,025
I'm sorry.
Please excuse us just this once.

771
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:17,735
BULLIES: I'm sorry.

(Hyunseok sighs)

773
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:21,572
Do this again,

774
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:23,824
and our deal is off.

775
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:25,701
Understood?

776
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:27,286
Come on. Don't be like that.

777
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,455
All this time,
we've been working together...

778
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:31,791
So fly right.

779
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:33,417
Yes, sir.

780
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,127
We'll be more careful.

781
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:38,005
BULLIES: We'll be more careful.

782
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:42,677
(suspenseful music)

783
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,224
(bully 1 sighs)
What are we going to do now?

784
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:49,517
STUDENT DORMITORY

785
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,018
JUYOUNG: What? 100,000 won?

786
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:54,063
Yes. It was a Napa Valley wine.

787
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:57,358
Was it called Cabernet Sauvignon?

788
00:37:57,441 --> 00:38:00,820
Anyway, it tasted super fancy.
It felt so good in my mouth.

789
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:02,363
Wow, that's crazy.

790
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:04,782
How many bottles of soju
is that with 10,000 won?

791
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:06,242
Wait.

792
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:08,911
That's why your lips are so purple.

793
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:11,872
-JUYOUNG: Let me see.
-What are you doing? You're crazy.

794
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,083
-My gosh.
-What's all this fuss about?

795
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:15,918
Haven't you had wine before?

796
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,129
It was my first time.

797
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:19,171
I haven't yet.

798
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,506

(clears throat)

800
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:25,594
Well, I'm not saying
I liked it because it was expensive.

801
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:28,681
You know, it's about manners.

802
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:31,434
He's got the "Ladies first" etiquette.

803
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:34,103
You know, things like
opening doors and pulling chairs for you.

804
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:35,771
-You know what I mean.
-I do.

805
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:38,316
EUNKANG (sighs): That's what impressed me.

806
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:41,694
I mean, honestly, boys in this school
don't know anything about "Ladies first."

807
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:43,070
When the cafeteria opens,

808
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:46,032
they just push aside all the girls
so they can eat first.

809
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:48,034
(sigh)
Those lame bastards.

810
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:52,455
This is why we should meet
outside people as many as possible.

811
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:54,040
If we just stay here...

812
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:55,541
(groans)

813
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:58,085
-...our standards will get lower.
-Mm-hm.

814
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:01,088
Anyway, sounds like
that guy is interested in you.

815
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:03,341
Guys only spend money on girls they like.

816
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,675
Is that so?

817
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:06,802
-ARI: You're so lucky!
-(giggles)

818
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:08,804
JUYOUNG: That bastard.

819
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:10,556
Why?

820
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:12,391
Did you pay?

821
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:15,186
Well, I had to,
because he didn't bring his wallet.

822
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:17,396
So I paid for dinner and coffee.

823
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,148
But now that I think about it,

824
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:23,069
-he might have been lying.
-Of course, he was.

825
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:25,863
You really must have not been his type.

826
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:28,908
Most guys pay the bills
when they're with younger girls.

827
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:32,078
(quirky music)

828
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:37,208
It's just a joke.
(chuckles awkwardly)

829
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,086
My stomach hurts. Excuse me for a second.

830
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:43,047
You're not going anywhere.
How dare you break my heart!

831
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:44,340
I'm sorry.

832
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:46,926
-You're so dead! Are you even my friend?
-ARI: I'm so sorry!

833
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:49,178
-I should go to bed.
-JUYOUNG: Are you my friend?

834
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:50,388
ARI: I'm so sorry.

835
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:51,639
(music stops)

836
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:57,311
(groans, inhales)

837
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:01,190
-Hey, Seunghyun.
-Yeah?

838
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:02,691
Do you think he might betray us?

839
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:05,027
No way. He seemed nice.

840
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:08,072
Right? Other seniors
wouldn't have done that for us.

841
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:09,657
(breathes heavily)

842
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,825
Okay. Done!

843
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,159
(grunts)

844
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,078
DEFENDANT'S STATEMENTS
AND THE COURT'S DECISION

845
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:16,539
What convinced the police
that the husband was the culprit

846
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:20,584
was the fingernail marks on his arm.

847
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,753
HEESUN: The detectives concluded

848
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:25,214
that those marks were made

849
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:28,592
as she grasped his arm
when he was strangling her.

850
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:31,554
But the husband denied it.

851
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:34,432
He said he self-harmed himself

852
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:37,268
because he was shocked
by his wife's death.

853
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,229
Three fingernail marks.

854
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:45,985
If you see the husband as a suspect,
they are clear evidence of self-defense.

855
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:50,322
But, if you see him
as the victim of this incident,

856
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:53,409
it's evidence of one man's struggles.

857
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:56,829
How should detectives interpret this?

858
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:00,749
-We must explore both possibilities.
-HEESUN: Correct.

859
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:04,462
But it is not practical to put
all the time and people we have

860
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:05,963
into the investigation.

861
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:09,383
That's why we make a hypothesis

862
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:13,512
and investigate the case accordingly.

863
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:16,474
But by doing this, we sometimes miss

864
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:19,477
a very important evidence or witness.

865
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:22,813
That's it for today.

866
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,484
Next week is the midterm.
You know that, right?

867
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:27,693
CLASS: Yes, ma'am.

868
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:29,195
I wish you luck on the exam.

869
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:32,948
CLASS: Thank you.

870
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:35,743
-(door opens then closes)
-(Ari sighs)

871
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:37,578
Starting this week,
I'm not getting any sleep.

872
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:39,747
I have three exams next week.

873
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:41,415
Me too.

874
00:41:42,124 --> 00:41:44,668
I heard Professor Bang's really stingy
when it comes to grading.

875
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:49,173
And we're taking this course
with the seniors. It's unfair for us.

876
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:50,299
Tell me about it.

877
00:41:50,382 --> 00:41:52,801
-Let's go and find seats in the library.
-Okay.

878
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:02,311
(pens scribbling)

879
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:13,781
(quirky music)

880
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:18,118
DAEIL: Bumju.

881
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,913
COME OUT

882
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:26,835
(quirky music continues)

883
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:37,888
(clanking)

884
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:40,474
(grunts)

885
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:42,351
(clanking)

886
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:48,440
Hmm?

887
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:51,360
Why three? Who is it for?

888
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:52,861
Who else?

889
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:59,410
-Do you want to get good grades?
-Of course.

890
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:02,663
Let's go. Take them out.

891
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:07,001
OCCUPIED

892
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:11,046
VACANT

893
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:16,468
(whispers)
I thought you could use some sugar.

894
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:18,262
(object clatters)

895
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:22,433
How considerate.

896
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:23,892
(metal clanks)

897
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:25,394
(slurps)

898
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:27,229
(exhales)

899
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:28,606
It's perfectly sweet.

900
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:30,899
I was actually getting hungry.

901
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:33,611
DAEIL: Here's some beef jerky too.

902
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:37,364
It's made of Korean beef eye of round.

903
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:40,075
Chewing it will
relieve your stress from studying.

904
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,452
You're very thoughtful.

905
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:43,704
Yoo Daeil, was it?

906
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:45,039
Yes, that's my name.

907
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:47,708
It's such an honor

908
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:49,668
that you remember my name.

909
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:53,047
-Thanks for the food anyway.
-DAEIL: My pleasure.

910
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:54,965
I'll get going then.

911
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:02,139
Sir, is there anything else
you'd like to say to me?

912
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,349
Oh, right.

913
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:07,728
STRAIGHT-A STUDENT: Make sure
to use it only for yourself.

914
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:12,816
Thank you, sir!

915
00:44:13,942 --> 00:44:15,194
Do you know who that is?

916
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:18,989
He's the legendary straight-A student.

917
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:20,824
-So this is the legendary...
-(shushes)

918
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:23,535
DAEIL: We're not sharing it
with anyone else. Got it?

919
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:24,536
Okay.

920
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,580
Scores are all that matter,
and that decides what?

921
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:27,581
Where we'll be working.

922
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:30,542
Our grades will decide
where we'll be assigned to later.

923
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:32,878
You need good grades
for the overseas exchange program too.

924
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:34,880
I'll be in first place.

925
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:38,258
And you second. Should I apply
to an American school?

926
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:40,469
-Me too.
-We can't apply for the same country.

927
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:42,888
-You go East. I'll go West.
-(both chuckling)

928
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:44,306
-What are you doing?
-(gasps)

929
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:45,474
(coughs)

930
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,768
-What is that?
-What? Want some coffee?

931
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:49,144
-JUYOUNG: What is it?
-(Daeil laughing awkwardly)

932
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:50,479
-JUYOUNG: Hey.
-(Daeil groaning)

933
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:53,941
-JUYOUNG: What is it?
-Oh, my gosh. My legs.

934
00:44:54,566 --> 00:44:56,610
My feet hurt.
My blood must not be circulating.

935
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:58,320
Probably from sitting for so long.

936
00:44:58,404 --> 00:45:01,448
You're right. The weather is nice.
We should get some exercise.

937
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:03,450
(both breathe deeply)

938
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:05,369
The fine dust level is super high today.

939
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:06,870
(both coughing)

940
00:45:06,995 --> 00:45:09,957
Unbelievable. You know it's not right.

941
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:12,042
What?

942
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:13,377
You're not supposed to

943
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:15,629
keep it to yourself. Share it with me.

944
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,550
JUYOUNG: Gosh.
And I thought we were friends.

945
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:21,260
(breathes deepy, sucks teeth)

946
00:45:21,343 --> 00:45:23,929
-The thing is, Juyoung...
-You see, I mastered

947
00:45:24,012 --> 00:45:26,640
adult comic books when I was nine.

948
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:30,352
JUYOUNG: I've seen most kinds of porn
and adult comic books.

949
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:34,773
(sighs)
I don't know how dirty that is,

950
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:37,317
but keep it to yourself. Selfish bastards.

951
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:38,986
(both groaning)

952
00:45:39,194 --> 00:45:41,905
Well, this one is really hardcore.

953
00:45:43,323 --> 00:45:46,201
I can't open it in broad daylight.

954
00:45:47,035 --> 00:45:48,162
I'll show you later.

955
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:49,371
When it's dark.

956
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,039
Then...

957
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:53,834
-call me.
-I will.

958
00:45:57,129 --> 00:45:58,046
JUYOUNG: Hey.

959
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:01,133
-You have to call me, okay?
-I will.

960
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:06,472
(both sigh in relief)

961
00:46:08,056 --> 00:46:09,266
(chuckles)

962
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:11,268
-(both gasp)
-So dirty.

963
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:13,562
-It's so dirty.
-(both giggling)

964
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:15,564
(breathes deeply)

965
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:16,565
Let's go to America.

966
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:19,026
HYUNSEOK: Honor Pledge.

967
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:23,030
STUDENTS: As a proud student of KNPU,

968
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:26,742
I affirm that I will obey the rules
throughout the exam period,

969
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:29,536
and that all work will be my own.

HEESUN: We'll start the midterm exam now.

973
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:43,717
There will be no supervisors,
but as you made the Honor Pledge,

974
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:47,596
those who cheat
or commit any kind of illegal act

975
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:50,015
will be given a zero
according to school regulations

976
00:46:50,098 --> 00:46:52,392
and will be expelled
or subject to severe punishment.

977
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,770
-HEESUN: You know that, right?
-CLASS: Yes, ma'am.

978
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:55,813
All right, then.

979
00:46:56,563 --> 00:46:57,648
Begin.

980
00:46:58,023 --> 00:46:58,941
(computer beeps)

00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:01,109

00:47:10,702 --> 00:47:11,954
This is...

985
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:18,210

00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:36,788
(exhales sharply)

994
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:41,335
Hey, how did the exam go?

995
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:43,879
-Pardon?
-Do you want to go have a cup of coffee?

996
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:46,715
-(sighs)
-Come on. Let's go.

997
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:50,177
HYUNSEOK: Let's sit over there.

998
00:48:55,515 --> 00:48:56,350
(grunts)

999
00:48:57,809 --> 00:48:59,227
Professor Bang's exam is hard.

1000
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:03,148
She always gives us tricky questions.
I never have enough time for her exams.

1001
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:05,108
Right. I also used up all the time.

1002
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:06,151
I see.

1003
00:49:07,235 --> 00:49:11,114
Man, I had to rush,
but Wooyong kept texting me.

1004
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:14,993
Well...

1005
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:18,413
You saw it, right?
That I was using my phone.

1006
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:20,958
Yes.

1007
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:25,045
Wooyong kept texting me
with Promotion Corps stuff.

1008
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:27,339
HYUNSEOK: I was texting him back
until the last moment,

1009
00:49:27,422 --> 00:49:28,924
I couldn't even hand in my phone.

1010
00:49:30,175 --> 00:49:32,177
(suspenseful music)

1011
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:35,263
Why? You don't believe me?

1012
00:49:36,014 --> 00:49:38,809
Do you want to see the texts?
I'll show them to you.

1013
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,022
Wait.

1014
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:47,192
Actually, I'm not sure if I can show you.
I just realized that

1015
00:49:47,859 --> 00:49:51,154
it's not just about work.
We talked about something private too.

1016
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,115
(sighs)

1017
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:55,659
Hang on a second.

1018
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:58,787
I don't need to see it.

1019
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,498
I believe...

1020
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:05,502
-what you say.
-Good.

1021
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:07,671
Don't worry. Just...

1022
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:10,173
-Just trust me. Okay?
-Okay.

1023
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:15,762
(slurps)

1024
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:17,556
(glass clinks)

1025
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:19,641
I'm doomed.

1026
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,518
(breathes deeply)

1027
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:23,311
I'm so doomed.

1028
00:50:23,603 --> 00:50:24,438
(pouring liquid)

1029
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:26,148
(Bumju grumbles)

1030
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:28,984
I told you we shouldn't trust him.

1031
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:30,527
(shuddering)

1032
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:31,862
(sighs)

1033
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:33,655
It was false hope.

1034
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:36,241
(pouring liquid)

1035
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:37,993

DAEIL: Sir.

1041
00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:03,393
-The problem you gave us...
-STRAIGHT-A STUDENT: Oh, right.

1042
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:05,228
I gave you the wrong one.

1043
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:09,191
But you guys are good.
I'm sure you did well.

1044
00:51:10,942 --> 00:51:11,943
(stammering)
Wait, sir...

1045
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:13,653
-Sir.
-No.

1046
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:14,780
BUMJU and DAEIL: Sir.

1047
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:16,406
-BUMJU: Sir?
-DAEIL: Sir!

1048
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:17,949
DAEIL: Hey!

1049
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:22,788
NO RUNNING, NO DIVING

1050
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:25,040
(whimpers)

1051
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:29,252
That was so selfish of you.
You deserve it, moron.

1052
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:34,424
(screaming)
You!

1053
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:36,301
What the...

1054
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:40,305
(exhales sharply)

1055
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:43,725
My situation is worse.
I submitted an empty paper.

1056
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:45,602
(Tak sighs)

1057
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:49,147
DAEIL: You're right.

1058
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:52,400
What's the point of fighting
amongst us at the bottom?

1059
00:51:57,155 --> 00:51:59,199
-(slurps)
-What do we do now?

1060
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:00,575
(exhales sharply)

1061
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:03,036
We have no other option.

1062
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:09,084
Put all we got into special activities.

1063
00:52:11,044 --> 00:52:12,462
That's a part of our grades too.

1064

1068
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:32,149
KNPU students have been
doing volunteer work for 15 years.

1069
00:52:32,774 --> 00:52:35,360
I know you probably want to enjoy
the first weekend after the exam,

1070
00:52:35,443 --> 00:52:37,195
but we're here to help people in need,

1071
00:52:37,279 --> 00:52:39,197
so I hope you enjoy your time here.

1072
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:40,282
STUDENTS: Yes, ma'am.

1073
00:52:40,365 --> 00:52:43,368
I will treat and love them
like they're my family!

1074
00:52:43,451 --> 00:52:44,744
I will do my best, ma'am!

1075
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:45,954
I got this!

1076

That's so cool.

-JUYOUNG: Isn't it awesome?
-Yes.

1084
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:21,072
You should try making something too.

1085
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:23,074
-JUYOUNG: Follow me.

Thanks.

1093
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:02,113
Is it doable?

1094
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:05,325
Yes. I don't clean at home,
but I get to do it here.

1095
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:07,244
My mom's going to feel so betrayed.
(chuckles)

1097

(crying)

1099
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,169
Did somebody hit you?

1100
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:19,589
(sobs)
He took my notebook.

1101
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:21,716
Where is he? Let me scold him.

1102
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:24,302
(kids shouting in distance)

1103
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:28,390
I'll just take a look
and give it back to you right away.

1104
00:54:28,473 --> 00:54:31,142
Yerin said she wrote her name on it.
I just want to check that.

1105
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:33,812
No. It's mine.

EUNKANG: You'll be in trouble
if you're lying.

1108
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:38,775
You know who I am.

1109
00:54:39,317 --> 00:54:41,152
I'm a cop. A cop.

1110
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:43,530
Not yet.

1111
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:45,490
I will be soon. Anyway,

1112
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:48,910
it seems very suspicious
that you don't want to show it to me.

1113
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:50,453
If you're innocent, show it to me.

1114
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:53,164
Mm-hm?

1115
00:54:58,586 --> 00:55:00,797
Why? Are you embarrassed to say it?

1116
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:06,678
(cheerful music)

1117
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:12,392
EUNKANG: Yerin, I checked the notebook,

1118
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:14,644
and it isn't yours. It's Jiwoong's.

1119
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:17,188
YERIN: No, it is mine.

1120
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:20,400
GIRL 2: Yerin. Here.

1121
00:55:22,068 --> 00:55:23,737
-Isn't it yours?
-Huh?

1122
00:55:24,237 --> 00:55:26,990
I found it over there on the ground.

1123
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:29,826
LEE YERIN

1124
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:31,369
Oh. It's mine.

00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:32,912
Thanks. Let's go.

1126
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:36,624
(in English, Korean) Uh, stop. Stop.
Come back here.

1127
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:39,336
EUNKANG: You can't just go like that.

1128
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:42,213
You should say sorry to Jiwoong
for suspecting him.

1129
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:45,175
Sorry.

1130
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:48,136
Louder.

1131
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:52,474
I'm sorry, Jiwoong.

1132
00:55:56,978 --> 00:55:59,397
EUNKANG: My, we almost framed
an innocent boy.

1133
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:00,774
SEUNGHYUN: I know.

1134
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:02,442
(kids chattering indistinctly)

1135
00:56:03,651 --> 00:56:05,070
Wasn't he kind of cute?

1136
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:06,988
Mm-hm.

1137
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:11,868
(quirky music)

1138
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:17,332
HAPPY BIRTHDAY JIWOONG, SUJIN

1139
00:56:21,669 --> 00:56:23,254
I got it from my girlfriend.

1140
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:27,258
And the other kids
don't know we're dating.

1141
00:56:31,137 --> 00:56:32,931
EUNKANG: He was almost framed as a thief,

1142
00:56:33,014 --> 00:56:34,933
but he wouldn't show it to us
until the end.

1143
00:56:35,016 --> 00:56:37,227
What a man.

1144
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,230
(indistinct chattering in distance)

1145
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:44,317
HYUNSEOK: You don't believe me?

1146
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:48,321
Do you want to see the texts?
I'll show them to you.

1147
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:50,407
Wait.

1148
00:56:51,032 --> 00:56:53,701
Actually, I'm not sure if I can show you.
I just realized that

1149
00:56:54,202 --> 00:56:57,539
it's not just about work.
We talked about something private too.

1150
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:01,084
(sipping)

1151
00:57:03,628 --> 00:57:05,422
-KIDS: Goodbye!
-MALE STUDENT: Bye.

1152
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:06,756
See you later.

1153
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:08,466
Please visit us again!

1154
00:57:09,217 --> 00:57:10,135
Bye!

1155
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:12,220
(kids saying goodbye)

1156
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:14,097
Come again!

1157
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:15,432
We'll come again.

1158
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:17,350
-Bye.
-Let's go.

1159
00:57:18,393 --> 00:57:20,103
(kids saying goodbye)

1160
00:57:29,571 --> 00:57:31,197
(engine revving)

1161
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:39,789
(engine rumbling)

1162
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:46,504
Sir.

1163
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:51,634
Are you still mad at me?

1164
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:54,179
(clears throat)

1165
00:57:54,345 --> 00:57:56,306
I placed the order correctly.

1166
00:57:57,182 --> 00:57:59,017
It was the company's mistake.

1167
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:00,685
(sighs)

1168
00:58:00,768 --> 00:58:02,228
They're doing that again.

1169
00:58:04,522 --> 00:58:07,817
You still should have double-checked
after sending the email. Okay?

1170
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:10,153
Right.

1171
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:14,407
I'll do better next time.
So please don't be mad at me.

1172
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:16,284
(chuckles)

1173
00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:18,203
I wasn't mad at you.

1174
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:20,455
Then why did you ignore my message?

1175
00:58:20,955 --> 00:58:22,916
I texted you saying I was sorry.

1176
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:25,168
Message? When?

1177
00:58:25,293 --> 00:58:26,586
(cellphone keypad clacking)

1178
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:27,712
On Thursday.

1179
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:29,714
Uh...

1180
00:58:31,132 --> 00:58:34,636
Sorry. My phone broke that day,
and I took it to a repair shop.

1181
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:35,678
(foreboding music)

1182
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:38,223
WOOYONG: I got it back last night,
so I didn't see the message.

1183
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:39,516
ARI: I see.

1184
00:58:40,725 --> 00:58:41,976
EXAM: ANALYSIS OF COLD CASES

1185
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:45,605
EXAM DATE: 13:00 - 15:00,
THURSDAY, APRIL 27, 2017

1186
00:58:46,439 --> 00:58:48,983
Wooyong kept texting me
with Promotion Corps stuff.

1187
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:53,655
Excuse me, sir.

1188
00:58:56,449 --> 00:58:58,284
(leaves rustling)

1189
00:59:00,745 --> 00:59:02,914
HYUNSEOK: I told you.
It's a private matter with Wooyong.

1190
00:59:02,997 --> 00:59:04,332
Wooyong said...

1191
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:06,626
he never sent a text that day.

1192
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:08,586
(tense suspenseful music)

1193
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:12,006
That day, his phone was at a repair shop.

1194
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:17,136
I don't know why you lied,

1195
00:59:18,763 --> 00:59:20,598
but I think you should turn yourself in.

1196
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:24,227
(suspenseful music continues)

1197
00:59:28,189 --> 00:59:30,149
Gosh. You're very annoying.

1198
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:38,283
(foreboding music)

1199
00:59:55,883 --> 00:59:57,844
SEUNGHYUN (on phone) Hey. Stop it.

1200
00:59:57,927 --> 00:59:59,387
I said, stop!

1201
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:01,598
(thrilling music)

1202
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:05,143
Let's not complicate things, okay?

1203
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:29,500
(closing theme music)
