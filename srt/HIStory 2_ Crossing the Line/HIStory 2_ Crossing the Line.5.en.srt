6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,599
I don't care how arrogant you were at your old school.

7
00:00:34,599 --> 00:00:37,800
But now that you've come to Zhi Hong, you should be more law-abiding.

8
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,399
Same goes for you two.

9
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,200
Behave yourselves.

10
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,200
You don't want me to ask your mom to come here again, do you?

11
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,600
You can't catch me!

12
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,300
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Xia Yu Hao, come back!

14
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,800
Hello, Director.

15
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,200
Straighten your ties.

16
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,001
Yes, Director.

17
00:01:36,001 --> 00:01:37,200
Got it.

18
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,101
Did you see that?

19
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,100
Yes. He jumped this high.

20
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:43,800
Very high.

21
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,400
What's his name?

22
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,900
Xia Yu Hao.

23
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,760
I think he is a Year One. Find out more about him.

24
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,800
You're so bad. What are you doing?

25
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,400
Hurry! There are no more opportunities.

26
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,900
Hurry! What are you doing?

27
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,200
It hurts! Hurts! Hurts!

28
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:02,900
That's enough, Junior.

29
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,900
Jun-Junior!

30
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:06,500
Do you know him?

31
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,500
I don't.

32
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,800
Baby, just give your body to me.

33
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,800
Crazy!

34
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,700
Hey, is he talking about you or me?

35
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,400
It's definitely you.

36
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,899
Hey, Junior!

37
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,200
Volleyball is really a great sport.

38
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,500
It helps you relieve stress

39
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,000
and it's very good for your kidneys.

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,900
Just like me.

41
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,600
Do you have a girlfriend?

42
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,000
I can introduce a few to you.

43
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,300
What type do you like?

44
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,600
Tell me.

45
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,500
Don't bother me!

46
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,700
Hey, he's ignoring me.

47
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,860
I also want to ignore you.

48
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,800
Flower. Flower.

49
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,400
I can help myself.

50
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,500
Do you need help?

51
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:49,600
Don't be shy. Don't be shy.

52
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,799
Flower!

53
00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:51,900
Wait, I can't find it.

54
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:52,800
Zi Xuan, come and help me.

55
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,200
Hey!

56
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,340
You've thought about it clearly?

57
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,000
You want to join us?

58
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,400
It's really not bad.

59
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,899
What do you guys do after school?

60
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,500
If you're not busy, you can come here and have fun.

61
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,400
It really is fun.

62
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,700
What's so great about this thing?

63
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,900
Hey!

64
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,800
Senior!

65
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,400
You guys are the ones pestering me.

66
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,500
I was wrong.

67
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,440
I saw you wrongly.

68
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,500
You don't have anything or people you cherish?

69
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,400
What?

70
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,299
That's why you don't know what "cherish" means.

71
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,520
And you've never worked hard for anything before, right?

72
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,600
Cherish a ball?

73
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,000
Twelve idiots running all over a court?

74
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,100
What bullshit did you just say?

75
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,499
Senior, don't be like this.

76
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,099
Jun Zhe, Senior, come and help!

77
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,800
That's enough.

78
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,500
Please leave.

79
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,899
Everyone back to training. Start your movements!

80
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,000
Yes, Senior.

81
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,100
What's so hard about playing volleyball?

82
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,560
It's just hitting a ball to the other side.

83
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,400
Even a pig can do that.

84
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,400
Yes, a pig can do that but it doesn't know the rules.

85
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,700
This is the serving line.

86
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,300
This is what we call "serving the ball."

87
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,500
Jia Jun! The ball.

88
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,200
Got it.

89
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,200
Very good.

90
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,600
Now that's what we call volleyball.

91
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,400
Aren't you leaving yet... pig?

92
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,600
Pig, your mother!

93
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,300
What are you doing?

94
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,100
What are you doing?

95
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:39,500
Senior.

96
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,100
What are you trying to do?

97
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,700
Stop it, Jia Jun.

98
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,600
You can't fight.

99
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,000
Do you only know to use picking fights to solve your problems?

100
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,500
All right! Everyone, back to training!

101
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,601
Get back to training.

102
00:05:02,601 --> 00:05:04,200
Yes, Senior.

103
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:09,020
We can start gathering information on Xia Yu Hao.

104
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,900
He's really not bad, you know?

105
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,900
The ball flew so high earlier.

106
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:13,800
That was really good.

107
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,200
But... he's just a little hard to handle.

108
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,500
Let's talk about this later.

109
00:05:18,501 --> 00:05:21,200
Don't worry. Leave this to me.

110
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:23,900
Hey!

111
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,800
Stop pulling on me.

112
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,100
Why did you just leave

113
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,600
just like that?

114
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,200
I wasn't in the mood.

115
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,500
I can crush them for you.

116
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,140
Especially the guy with the glasses.

117
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,660
You just transferred here. Don't cause any trouble.

118
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,800
Mind your own business.

119
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,900
This isn't like you. You're just letting it go like this?

120
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,981
If you're going to keep on nagging, then go back to our old school.

121
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,000
I really don't get you.

122
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,499
I'm the one who was expelled and forced to transfer here,

123
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,000
why did you follow me?

124
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,700
I was afraid you might feel lonely and all alone.

125
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,176
You got expelled because of me.

126
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,500
I couldn't let you come here alone.

127
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,580
Even your older brother transferred.

128
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,900
He wanted to come.

129
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,500
That had nothing to do with me.

130
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,400
Whatever.

131
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,400
Hey, so you're just going to let them off like that?

132
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,900
Say another word and I'll hit you.

133
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,400
Hey!

134
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,600
Hello, Manager! Captain!

135
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,000
You're here to get the log book?

136
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,399
Yes, Xiao Xiao forgot it.

137
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,000
Thanks.

138
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,500
No problem.

139
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,300
What?

140
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,999
Wow, you look fit.

141
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,600
Fitter than you. It feels great!

142
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,500
Wait a second.

143
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,300
What?

144
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,800
Take better care with your appearance, Captain.

145
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,800
Otherwise, the Coach will be scolding you again.

146
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,000
I'll just loosen it a little.

147
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,800
What's the use of having it so tight?

148
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,000
What's the matter?

149
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,500
I have made my decision.

150
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,899
I want him to join the team!

151
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:17,700
Huh?

152
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,000
I want him to join the team.

153
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,300
Who?

154
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,499
Xia Yu Hao.

155
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,800
Don't you think his arm strength and jumping abilities are very good?

156
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,601
What do you think?

157
00:07:25,601 --> 00:07:27,400
I think...

158
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,700
Do whatever you want.

159
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,976
But whoever brings the lunch should be the one to finish it.

160
00:07:30,976 --> 00:07:32,500
Okay?

161
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,899
What kind of logic is that?

162
00:07:34,899 --> 00:07:37,076
The manager should be the one finishing the captain's leftovers.

163
00:07:37,076 --> 00:07:39,600
So, you're just going to throw me everything you don't want?

164
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,180
Then, what are you going to do as captain?

165
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,400
The captain...

166
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,500
The captain is in charge of commanding the manager.

167
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,900
You're hitting me?

168
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:51,400
Hey!

169
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,800
Fuck.

170
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,000
You look really ugly!

171
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,500
Students, right now we're on page 33.

172
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,000
This is the main point.

173
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,999
Okay. Let's look at this now.

174
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,800
The distance across a flat surface

175
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,500
follows a path

176
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,600
to a specific point on the surface.

177
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,800
There is a curve from point A to point B.

178
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,600
Let's look at the diagram here.

179
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,900
Junior... you're only young once.

180
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,300
So you should sweat out (your frustrations) on the court.

181
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,600
Joining the volleyball team is your best choice.

182
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,199
I won't make you regret choosing me.

183
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,000
So what do you think?

184
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,100
There are lots of advantages to volleyball.

185
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:09,000
Like, it can help you with--

186
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,400
Leave!

187
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,100
Quit fooling around. I'm hungry.

188
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,700
Okay. You're really hungry.

189
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,101
What do you want to eat?

190
00:09:23,101 --> 00:09:24,800
Let's eat...

191
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,301
Let me tell you.

192
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:29,400
I know of a new pool club.

193
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,400
It's new and awesome.

194
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,600
Senior!

195
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,341
Jia Jun and Jun Zhe, not bad.

196
00:09:36,341 --> 00:09:38,200
What are you looking at?

197
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,300
Very good.

198
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,000
I heard they were in the top eight last year.

199
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,400
It's all thanks to He Cheng En and the guy with the glasses.

200
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,000
But the guy wearing glasses got injured, so it's all over for him.

201
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,700
Was he really that great?

202
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,900
Yes.

203
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:03,000
He was the best spiker for two years in a row.

204
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,000
What should we eat for lunch?

205
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,700
I'll pay.

206
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,199
Hey, Junior!

207
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,200
If you join the volleyball team,

208
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,376
I'll give you a month's worth of meal coupons.

209
00:10:33,376 --> 00:10:34,101
How about it?

210
00:10:34,101 --> 00:10:36,099
Damn it, stop bothering me! What do you not understand?

211
00:10:36,099 --> 00:10:37,800
Xia Yu Hao!

212
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,600
Hello, Director.

213
00:10:40,601 --> 00:10:42,481
I knew you were going to be trouble.

214
00:10:42,481 --> 00:10:44,200
Come with me to the Office of Academic Affairs. I'm going to call your mother.

215
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,599
Director, they were just fooling around.

216
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,000
We really were just fooling around.

217
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
That's right, Director. We're just fooling around.

218
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,300
We're cultivating our friendship.

219
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,800
Wow! Your abs are trained really nicely.

220
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,899
Right? Right?

221
00:10:52,899 --> 00:10:54,700
Don't cover for him.

222
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,800
Encouraging violence will just make bullying even worse.

223
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,400
Let's go.

224
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,099
Director, we were really just fooling around.

225
00:10:59,099 --> 00:11:00,200
Yes, we're playing this card game.

226
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,800
Pick a card. Pick a card.

227
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,000
For letting Director misunderstand, we're sorry.

228
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,999
If that's really the case,

229
00:11:08,999 --> 00:11:10,300
I'll let you go this time.

230
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,300
But be more careful next time!

231
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,199
And you guys, do you not know how to wear your ties?

232
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,401
Straighten them up, now!

233
00:11:15,401 --> 00:11:17,500
Yes. Thank you, Director.

234
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,301
He's so annoying.

235
00:11:18,301 --> 00:11:21,200
That's right. He cares so much about our ties.

236
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,300
You're really unlucky, being on his radar.

237
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,199
But there's no way to avoid it,

238
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,499
you got transferred here for fighting.

239
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,599
He hates school violence the most.

240
00:11:26,599 --> 00:11:28,400
Get lost!

241
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,100
Xuan, he's a tough catch.

242
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,400
You should do something before trying to catch him.

243
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,300
What?

244
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,100
Hey, what is it?

245
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,000
Tell me!

246
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,399
Average velocity means the total distance traveled over time.
[Year Two Class]

247
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:55,500
- Sorry.
- Here's the formula.

248
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:00,299
- I wasn't intentionally trying to talk about your dark history.
 - V=(X2-X1)/(T2-T1)

249
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,100
I'm sorry.

250
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,800
Forgive me.

251
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,901
Go back to your own classroom!

252
00:12:05,901 --> 00:12:07,700
I'm never joining the volleyball team!

253
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,100
You two, what are you doing?!

254
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,300
I definitely won't!

255
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,900
Stop it right now!

256
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,800
Sit down!

257
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,000
Xia Yu Hao!

258
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,800
Are you here to learn?

259
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:32,900
He Cheng En.

260
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,800
Yes!

261
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,800
You keep coming here to disrupt my class,

262
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,600
do you want me to beat you that much?

263
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,100
How is that possible?

264
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,300
I loved coming to Ms. Zhong Zhong's class so much,

265
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:46,400
I just wanted to find an opportunity to come back and review.

266
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,000
It better be.

267
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,400
Let me warn you. Don't ever come to harass my students.

268
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,700
Xia Yu Hao.

269
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:02,200
You said you definitely won't join the volleyball team,

270
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,400
then... just join them.

271
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,000
Why should I join?

272
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,199
A coach's order is absolute.

273
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,500
So is a teacher's.

274
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,000
Or... do you want to fail Physics?

275
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,800
You're threatening me?

276
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,900
Welcome to the adult world.

277
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,400
Coach, very good!

278
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,500
Let's continue class.

279
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,170
Here, section four...

280
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,200
Pull your shoulders back a little.

281
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,220
How is Da Ke doing?

282
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,800
Listen up, everyone!

283
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,400
From now on,

284
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,999
Xia Yu Hao is our new teammate.

285
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:54,400
Please clap for him.

286
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,000
Welcome. Welcome.

287
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,400
What's going on?

288
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:06,000
No one can resist volleyball's charm.

289
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,800
How come you came?

290
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,600
All right, everyone,

291
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,541
let's get on with practice.

292
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:16,300
I'm not practicing.

293
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Hello.

294
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Zi Xuan, take Yu Hao to the commune to change into sports attire.

295
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,500
What is this?

296
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,399
Who wants this?

297
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,001
Exactly.

298
00:14:31,001 --> 00:14:34,700
Hey, don't think you're great just because the Coach asked you to join.

299
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:38,800
Why are you being so arrogant when you don't even know how to serve?

300
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,199
What does it have to do with you, short legs?

301
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,700
You know how to fight?

302
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,000
Who doesn't know how to fight?

303
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,401
Come at me then!

304
00:14:45,401 --> 00:14:47,500
- Jia Jun!
- You want to fight, is that it?

305
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,000
You can't do that!

306
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,300
Senior.

307
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:58,100
If you want to stay on the team, then don't fight.

308
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,300
Wait a minute.

309
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,300
Did you know we get suspended from the games if we fight,

310
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,676
so you said all that?

311
00:15:02,676 --> 00:15:03,900
So what if that's true?

312
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,500
Wow, you're too cunning.

313
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,960
Aren't we just a bunch of innocent and kind high school students?

314
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,900
You guys threatened my grades just to force me to join this team.

315
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,200
Do you think that's honorable?

316
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,101
That's right.

317
00:15:14,101 --> 00:15:17,800
I'm here now, so you can tell the Coach that.

318
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,100
Forcing him won't work. I'll go talk to the coach.

319
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,200
Wait. Hold on. Hold on.

320
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,200
How about this?

321
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,000
Pick one of us to serve.

322
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,100
If you can catch just one out of the three serves,

323
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,320
then you don't have to practice. What about it?

324
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,400
Bring it on.

325
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,700
All right.

326
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,201
Senior, let me do it!

327
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:38,000
You're done for!

328
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,800
I pick you.

329
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,400
I want to catch your serves.

330
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,200
He's the manager of our team.

331
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,600
I know that, so what?

332
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,900
I just want to catch your serves.

333
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,200
Do you dare?

334
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:09,500
Start practice. Start with fast breaks.

335
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,400
Aren't all ball teams like this?

336
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,600
You don't have any guts?

337
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,400
You're such a coward.

338
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,601
Don't be too much!

339
00:16:20,601 --> 00:16:21,500
Didn't I just tell you? He's our manager.

340
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,300
Be more polite. Be more polite.

341
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,600
What if you lose?

342
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,600
Then I'll do anything you want.

343
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,400
Xuan...

344
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,300
I know.

345
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:55,260
I haven't watched Senior play in a long time.

346
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,400
This is going to be good.

347
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,300
Let's do it.

348
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,000
First ball!

349
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,700
That was so easy, so easy!

350
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,400
He's really strong.

351
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,800
This is going to be 3-0.

352
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,800
Second ball!

353
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,800
This is the first time

354
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,800
I've seen someone get used to Senior Zi Xuan's serves so fast.

355
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,499
The next serve will determine the score. It's the ace serve.

356
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,500
Xuan.

357
00:17:36,501 --> 00:17:39,199
But I think he's more agile than you.

358
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,900
What did you say?

359
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,000
Step back. Everyone step back.

360
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,400
It's going to be a jump serve.

361
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,699
Nice one.

362
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,500
That was really fierce.

363
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,500
Senior!

364
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,400
- Are you okay?
-Zi Xuan!

365
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,000
I'm fine.

366
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,620
What else do you have to say?

367
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,100
Stop forcing yourself.

368
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,700
Let's go.

369
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,500
It's really hot, right?

370
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,000
Yes.

371
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,100
This is your punishment.

372
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,820
You actually really jumped?

373
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,500
I accidentally become too serious.

374
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,600
Don't be angry.

375
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,200
Hey.

376
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,300
Are you sure you want him on the team?

377
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,000
He will ruin the team spirit.

378
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,100
We don't have a choice.

379
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,100
Our team is really lacking a strong spiker

380
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,000
and he really has the potential.

381
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,400
So what if he has potential?

382
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,000
His attitude sucks, so he's useless.

383
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,700
How about we do it like the old times?

384
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,800
I'll take care of his attitude.

385
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,000
The training, I'll leave to you.

386
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,600
That again?

387
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,800
Please.

388
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,400
No.

389
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,800
- Please.
- No.

390
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,400
I'm begging you.

391
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,700
I won't get up if you don't agree.

392
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,800
Okay... Fine.

393
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,600
Promise me?

394
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,900
You're so annoying.

395
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,500
Here, here, here. Let me do it.

396
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,400
Relax. Relax.

397
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,400
Master, doesn't this feel comfortable?

398
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,300
Comfortable, my ass.

399
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,400
Don't do that again.

400
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,300
Okay.

401
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,280
Does this reach the bottom of your knee?

402
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,200
More on this side.

403
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,600
Are you really joining the team?

404
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,600
He Zhong Zhong is threatening me with my grades,

405
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,600
how can I not go?

406
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,900
You're right.

407
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,700
Here, eat this.

408
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,600
We're eating soon.

409
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,600
What about me?

410
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,200
Xia Yu Hao!

411
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,300
Do you remember me?

412
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,200
Who are you?

413
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,500
Hi.

414
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,900
Hi.

415
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,900
They are all afraid of Xia Yu Hao.

416
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,600
Even though you only just transferred, they are still scared of you.

417
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,500
I'd say they know things well; at least, they know who not to mess with.

418
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,700
Xia Yu Hao,

419
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,600
you don't need to be too courteous with me.

420
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,399
You got expelled because of me.

421
00:20:48,399 --> 00:20:52,200
So it's not a big deal treating you to this meal.

422
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,420
He was the one who wanted to help you.

423
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,800
I was just in it for the fight.

424
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,500
But you're the one who fought them off.

425
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,000
In the end, you're still the one who saved me.

426
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,500
Whatever. I need to go now.

427
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:10,900
Hey, just let her finish talking first.

428
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,500
Can't we still be friends?

429
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,600
I don't have many friends.

430
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,900
How would a pretty girl not have friends?

431
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:22,800
Yes, I'm always alone.

432
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Do you have some kind of a problem?

433
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,799
Do you insult people too much? Gossip too much?

434
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,100
Boyfriend snatcher?

435
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,700
How can you say that?

436
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,299
Then why would a pretty girl have no friends?

437
00:21:37,299 --> 00:21:39,300
Are you dumb?

438
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,976
He has a brain that is different from others.

439
00:21:40,976 --> 00:21:43,020
Don't take it too seriously.

440
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,540
How did you know that my brain's different from the others?

441
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,800
Don't say anything stupid.

442
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,900
Hey, I really need to go now.

443
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,000
Wait for me.

444
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,700
Hey. Hey!

445
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:02,800
I'm not done talking yet!

446
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,200
What time do you think it is right now?

447
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,300
All right, I know.

448
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,400
Stinky Zi Xuan.

449
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,199
Watch your footsteps.

450
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,000
Yes, Senior!

451
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,300
Jump higher.

452
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,900
Yes, Senior!

453
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,200
Hey, your posture is off.

454
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,800
Yes, Senior.

455
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,800
Good shot!

456
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,399
Zi Xuan, I looked in the classroom,

457
00:22:41,399 --> 00:22:43,000
but Xia Yu Hao wasn't there either.

458
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,600
I called him many times too, but he's not answering.

459
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,800
What do we do now? He still has so much training to do.

460
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,940
I'll go find him. I'll leave this to you.

461
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:54,000
Listen up!

462
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,980
Xiao Xiao is in charge now.

463
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,700
- Yes, Senior!
- Yes, Senior!

464
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,700
Hurry, hurry up and practice!

465
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,000
- Yes.
- Yes.

466
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,600
Junior,

467
00:23:16,601 --> 00:23:19,100
do you know where Xia Yu Hao is?

468
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,700
A good student like you wouldn't dare go to those places.

469
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,800
Hey.

470
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:26,000
Do you want me to get Ms. Zhong Zhong to come and ask you?

471
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
What's the matter?

472
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,000
Come on, I'll take you there.

473
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,700
Hey, are we there yet?

474
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,800
It's nearby.

475
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:53,000
Hey, where exactly is he?

476
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,600
It's the second shop, the X Club.

477
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,700
You're not coming in with me?

478
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,600
Didn't you want to go find him on your own?

479
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,700
Go on your own then.

480
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,801
Bye.

481
00:24:09,801 --> 00:24:11,900
Hey, Wang Zhen Wen.

482
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,000
Hey!

483
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,800
What are you doing?

484
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,300
You can't do drugs here.

485
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,600
What does that have to do with you?

486
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,500
What did you say?

487
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,700
Please leave.

488
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,700
What?

489
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,300
Xia Yu Hao!

490
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,500
Xia Yu Hao!

491
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,300
What are you doing?

492
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,300
Why did you come here?

493
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,000
Go away!

494
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,300
Go away!

495
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,500
Go away!

496
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,500
Let's go!

497
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,700
What are you guys doing?

498
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:07,000
If you don't leave, I'm calling the police!

499
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,376
You don't even know how to fight so why did you join in?

500
00:25:26,376 --> 00:25:29,000
Take this. Put it on yourself.

501
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,600
Does your family know you're working here?

502
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,000
What does that have to do with you?

503
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,200
Look after yourself first.

504
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,600
Is your leg okay?

505
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,799
I'm leaving first.

506
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,200
Hey.

507
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,100
This--

508
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,000
You're hurt so badly

509
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,920
and you still say you're fine?

510
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
You're actually not a bad person, so why pretend?

511
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,399
Pretend what?

512
00:26:25,399 --> 00:26:27,200
Did I ever say I was a bad person?

513
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,220
Do bad people ever admit they're bad?

514
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,000
Why did you cover for me?

515
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,600
The manager has to protect his teammates,

516
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,900
or should I have let you take the hit?

517
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,600
Did you think you wouldn't get hurt yourself?

518
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,600
Anyway, I can't get on the court and play.

519
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,780
So it doesn't make any difference to me.

520
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,000
Let me take you home later.

521
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,500
Thanks.

522
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,300
Does it still hurt?

523
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,940
It's all right.

524
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,999
Hey, let me say this first though.

525
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:49,699
I won't be good and just show up to practice

526
00:27:49,699 --> 00:27:51,720
because you blocked them for me earlier.

527
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,400
My house is here.

528
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,800
I won't use this as an exchange.

529
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,560
You can't be a good player if you're not playing with your heart.

530
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,800
Since you're so reluctant like this,

531
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,000
I'll talk to Coach tomorrow

532
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,800
and get her permission to excuse you from the team.

533
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,400
Thanks for walking me home.

534
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,800
Hey!

535
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,600
Is it some kind of a joke to you?

536
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,899
Threatening my grades to force me to join the team.

537
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:14,700
Turning my life upside down

538
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,800
and now you're saying it's over just like that.

539
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,300
Why are you getting mad?

540
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,500
I...

541
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,600
You didn't want to join the team, right?

542
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,800
Yes, I didn't want to.

543
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,300
A team like yours has no future,

544
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,240
so I don't want to practice on it.

545
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,800
We were in the top eight in the High School League last year.

546
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,999
This year, we'll definitely make it to the top four.

547
00:28:37,999 --> 00:28:41,000
Everyone is working hard for this goal.

548
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,900
This is also the last opportunity for He Cheng En and myself.

549
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:48,400
If you don't get it, then forget it.

550
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,200
Also,

551
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,700
I won't tell anyone where you're working as a part-timer.

552
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,300
Good night.

553
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,200
Hey, you--

554
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,300
Do you only know how to solve problems through fighting?

555
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,300
What's so fun about this?

556
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,100
Hey, Senior.

557
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,700
Was he really that strong?

558
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:14,800
He was the best spiker for two years in a row.

559
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,700
Let's go!

560
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,000
This--

561
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,499
Why did you help cover for me?

562
00:30:25,499 --> 00:30:26,999
The manager has to protect his teammates.

563
00:30:26,999 --> 00:30:29,800
Did you think you wouldn't get hurt yourself?

564
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,876
Anyway, I can't get on the court and play,

565
00:30:31,876 --> 00:30:33,980
so it doesn't make any difference to me.

566
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,200
What kind of injury would produce such a big scar?

567
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:13,100
No wonder he can't play volleyball.

568
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:20,900
Fuck.

569
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,800
What am I doing?

570
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,400
Everyone is working hard for this goal.

571
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,600
This is also the last opportunity for He Cheng En and myself.

572
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,000
What kind of goal is that?

573
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,600
Why was he trying to act cool?

574
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,000
Let's begin.

575
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:08,620
Remember to switch partners when you reach the blue line.

576
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,100
He Cheng En.

577
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,100
Stop slacking off.

578
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:23,000
Continue. The captain should lead the team.

579
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,500
No.

580
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:29,700
This exercise postion is so ugly; it's not cool at all.

581
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,520
Strength or looking cool: Which is more important?

582
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,900
Looking cool, of course.

583
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,499
Captain's team, do another twenty sets.

584
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,100
Back and forth.

585
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,200
All right!

586
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,076
You're not that cruel, are you?

587
00:32:44,076 --> 00:32:46,000
Without changing partners.

588
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,020
Carry on! Do you guys also want to do more?

589
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:52,000
Get on with it.

590
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,700
Continue!

591
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:01,700
Hey! You finally appeared.

592
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,600
Why are you here?

593
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I'm here to practice.

594
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,100
Very good.

595
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:14,000
Yes, very good.

596
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,500
Come, you and Da Ke are a group.

597
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:20,200
Cheng En, you're taking him.

598
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:20,900
Me?

599
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:21,800
Yes.

600
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,400
Hang on, does that mean...

601
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,100
Yes, twenty rounds.

602
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,000
Follow him. Twenty sets.

603
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,400
I'll be tired to death. Are you even human?

604
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,001
Go on!

605
00:33:31,001 --> 00:33:33,600
- Add 20.
- Continue.

606
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,400
Come on.

607
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,599
Hurry up. Hurry up! Hurry!

608
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,500
Da Ke will hold your legs up, okay?

609
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,700
No, I'm ignoring you.

610
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,299
Let me just rest for a bit.

611
00:33:43,299 --> 00:33:44,399
He's new, you should look after him.

612
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:45,800
Help me out, okay?

613
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,899
Let me rest a bit first.

614
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,600
You're the captain.

615
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,600
Continue. What are you doing?

616
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,020
Hurry! Yes, you.

617
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,800
Aren't you overtraining Xia Yu Hao?

618
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,100
No.

619
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:53,900
After running 5000 meters (3 miles), he immediately did 300 laps on a single leg in circles. Right?

620
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,200
Yes.

621
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,599
Then jumping rope, 500 times?

622
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:58,300
Yes.

623
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:01,300
Back and forth sprinting, 300 meters dash with 200 rounds?

624
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,700
And after that, he still has to practice with the other members?

625
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,699
It's necessary or else he won't have enough training before the competitions start.

626
00:36:05,699 --> 00:36:08,200
Aren't you being too cruel with this?

627
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,300
No, we used to train like that, too. Didn't we?

628
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,576
You also think it's too cruel, right?

629
00:36:12,576 --> 00:36:13,600
Me, too.

630
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,500
Xuan,

631
00:36:14,501 --> 00:36:17,200
not everyone can take it like us, the geniuses.

632
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,520
I agree with that sentence, but I don't think you are.

633
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,500
Serve. Hurry and serve!

634
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,501
Serve!

635
00:36:23,501 --> 00:36:25,300
This side. This side.

636
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:28,200
Now just serve randomly.

637
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,580
You're not catching them. You're not catching them. Hurry!

638
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,900
Serve. Serve it!

639
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,900
Here. Hurry, hurry, hurry!

640
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,200
Hurry up! Hurry!

641
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,900
Behind you.

642
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:43,999
Underhand practice.

643
00:36:43,999 --> 00:36:45,900
Come, number one.

644
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,700
Number two.

645
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,900
Number three.

646
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,700
Four.

647
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:59,000
Aiyo, I didn't serve it right.

648
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,100
What do you want, short legs?

649
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:03,500
What? Newbie, hurry and practice!

650
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,700
Senior, don't fight.

651
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,800
Don't pull me back.

652
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:13,000
What if he can't handle it and quits?

653
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,200
We'll lose a strong player just like that.

654
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,800
We'll just lose a strong player like that.

655
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,700
But, Xiao Xiao,

656
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,100
you can't blame me.

657
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,199
He's the one in charge of the training list.

658
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:25,400
Besides, Coach has agreed to it.

659
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,600
So if you want to blame someone, you can only blame him.

660
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,500
- Hey, you put me in charge of it.
- Zi Xuan!

661
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:31,800
Senior, something's wrong!

662
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,000
They are about to fight.

663
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,400
- Fight?
- Who?

664
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,800
Senior Jia Jun and Xia Yu Hao.

665
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,601
Really?

666
00:37:36,601 --> 00:37:39,000
Yes, they are in the gym.

667
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,500
You did that on purpose!

668
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,300
Yes, I did it on purpose. So what?

669
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:47,300
It annoys me to have a fool like you on our team!

670
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,001
I'll help you.

671
00:37:48,001 --> 00:37:49,400
- What?
- Don't fight!

672
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,900
Don't go.

673
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:51,700
They think they can bully us because there's more of them.

674
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:52,600
Don't cause trouble!

675
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,500
I don't care!

676
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,899
Come, don't you love to fight?

677
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,799
You got expelled because of a fight. Hit me then!

678
00:37:56,799 --> 00:37:58,400
You--

679
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,700
All of you, stop right there!

680
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:01,500
Damn it!

681
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,200
Chen Jia Jun!

682
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,600
Senior.

683
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,100
You, come with me.

684
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,600
It had nothing to do with him.

685
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,600
I wasn't talking to you.

686
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,500
I'll go myself.

687
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,900
What are you looking at?

688
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,100
What do you think you're doing?

689
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,000
It's almost competition time and you still have time to pick fights?

690
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,576
Do you all have that much time

691
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,000
and confidence you'll easily get to the championships?

692
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,500
Raise your hand if you do!

693
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,400
You punk, dared to raise your hand.

694
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,200
Everyone, down for 100 push-ups.

695
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,600
Jia Jun, you'll do 200.

696
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,700
Xiao Xiao, you count.

697
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,300
Okay.

698
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,300
Come on. Hurry.

699
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,899
Let's start.

700
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:55,100
One, two...

701
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,900
That short legs started it first.

702
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:02,099
I've already said to not cause trouble while you're on the team.

703
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:04,700
If you can't handle it, then you don't have to force yourself to stay.

704
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,899
No matter how you guys make trouble for me,

705
00:39:07,899 --> 00:39:09,800
I won't leave.

706
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,699
Junior,

707
00:39:12,699 --> 00:39:14,799
if you're afraid that I'm going to reveal your job,

708
00:39:14,799 --> 00:39:17,300
don't worry, I'm not that bored.

709
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:19,100
No.

710
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,100
I'm doing this for my mom.

711
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,600
What?

712
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,600
Are you a mama's boy?

713
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,200
You're a mama's boy!

714
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,100
I just...

715
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,999
don't want to disappoint her anymore.

716
00:39:52,999 --> 00:39:54,800
She hopes to see me play in the competition,

717
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,300
so I'll play.

718
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,600
Did you think anyone on the team can get on the court?

719
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,800
You can--

720
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,799
I can what?

721
00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:03,099
Train me.

722
00:40:03,099 --> 00:40:04,700
Train me as a starter.

723
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,399
You and He Cheng En kept pestering me,

724
00:40:06,399 --> 00:40:08,200
isn't it because I can?

725
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,700
It's only because you could be one.

726
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,900
Then, just make "could be" into "can be."

727
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,499
What's so hard about playing volleyball?

728
00:40:13,499 --> 00:40:15,000
See?

729
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,400
"What's so hard about playing volleyball?"

730
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,700
Yeah.

731
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,000
Do you really want to try?

732
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,140
You better prepare yourself then.

733
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:39,400
Here. Do it again.

734
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,200
Set the ball overhead.

735
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,560
Keep it right above your forehead.

736
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,299
Put some force into your fingers.

737
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,300
Soften your knees.

738
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,600
Maintain it at forehead level.

739
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:15,400
I didn't ask you to set the ball using your forehead.

740
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:21,000
Did it hit your eye?

741
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,400
Let me take a look.

742
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:52,830
♫ Loneliness is always easily,  ♫

743
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:58,360
♫ Easily camouflaging into independence  ♫

744
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:02,440
♫ Full of craziness, it’s gradually becoming expired  ♫

745
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:05,460
♫ Indulging the accumulation of feelings ♫

746
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:13,380
♫ Slowly, we start to get close ♫

747
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:16,780
♫ I’ve crossed over this boundary ♫

748
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:19,600
♫ No one taking precautions ♫

749
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:25,000
♫ No matter who advances and who retreats ♫

750
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:30,810
♫ We are not different, just again and again we keep passing by ♫

751
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:35,240
♫ The few moments that might have intersected ♫

752
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:38,610
♫ You crossed over this boundary ♫

753
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:41,320
♫ It’s not a violation ♫

754
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:46,760
♫ There won’t be any blame ♫

755
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:49,510
♫ Because love’s limit ♫

756
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:52,500
♫ Has already gone beyond understanding ♫

757
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:55,980
♫ Just let us go forward ♫

758
00:42:55,980 --> 00:43:03,290
♫ Once I’ve crossed over, I won’t retreat ♫
