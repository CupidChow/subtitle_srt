[HIStory 2 - Right or Wrong]

10
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,900
So the life and death cycle that we talk about, this is basically what it means.

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,700
Any questions?

12
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,200
- No.
- No.

13
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,100
No questions? Then that's all for today.

14
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,700
Remember to submit your homework if you haven't.

15
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,200
I won't extend the due date. Class dismissed.

16
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,600
Thank you, Professor.

17
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,600
Ye Wen Ling.

18
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,700
Professor?

19
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,700
What happened to Fei Sheng Zhe?

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Didn't he tell you?

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,200
He did.

22
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,200
He texted me a few days ago saying that he would be absent.

23
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,100
I asked him what happened

24
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,500
but he hasn't replied to me since.

25
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,400
So, what exactly happened?

26
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,100
He's sick.

27
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,800
Sick?

28
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,900
Really?

29
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,400
Of course, it's real.

30
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,500
What kind of sickness?

31
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,100
It's hard to say.

32
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,900
What's so hard to say about appendicitis?

33
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,600
A hernia is worse.

34
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,400
I just think it's very awkward.

35
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,300
Don't you think cutting out an appendix

36
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,700
sounds weird, no matter how you say it?

37
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,100
What's an appendix?

38
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,300
Appendix?

39
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,100
An appendix is located right here.

40
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,200
Do you see this?

41
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,400
It's near the stomach.

42
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,500
It's located inside.

43
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,700
It doesn't have much use,

44
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,700
but when it hurts, it hurts really bad.

45
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,700
So, the doctor had to do surgery and take it out from here.

46
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,000
Surgery must hurt really bad.

47
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,600
It really did hurt so much, so much.

48
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,900
It was like getting bumped really hard by a truck.

49
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,400
Daddy said it would stop hurting if you do this.

50
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,500
It seems like it's really not hurting anymore.

51
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,300
Thanks, Yo Yo.

52
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,500
Let's go. We'll eat in the living room.

53
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,800
I thought you were intentionally avoiding me,

54
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,300
missing work so you could quit.

55
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,300
I did think about it.

56
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,600
I really don't care.

57
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,100
That's why it was just a thought.

58
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,200
Besides, I know Yo Yo needs me. Right?

59
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,000
Yes.

60
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,500
I also need you, too.

61
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,300
I know.

62
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,100
Because without my cooking, you can't eat properly.

63
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,400
Consider it dieting.

64
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,100
What a brat.

65
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,800
You didn't use that thing, did you?

66
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,700
What thing?

67
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,300
Didn't we meet three years ago? Outside a bar?

68
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,200
You remembered?

69
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,200
You ran home crying the other day and so then I remembered.

70
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,900
Who cried?

71
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,600
Why did you cry, Brother Xiao Fei?

72
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,500
Let me tell you.

73
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,000
Brother Xiao Fei was crying so hard.

74
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,600
Brother Xiao Fei is a crybaby.

75
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm not a crybaby.

76
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,500
He is, right?

77
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,100
Yo Yo is much braver.

78
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,300
Daddy's talking nonsense. Don't listen to him.

79
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,000
Brother Xiao Fei, why did you cry?

80
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,900
Adults can't cry.

81
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,900
Who says adults can't cry?

82
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,900
Yo Yo, let me tell you.

83
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,200
Adults can also be sad and heartbroken.

84
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,300
When you're sad, you should cry it out.

85
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,700
All right. Hurry and get better.

86
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,100
I want to eat your cooking.

87
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,100
Me, too.

88
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,100
I want to eat omelette rice and pudding.

89
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,100
Pudding.

90
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,800
Once I'm better, I'll make it for you immediately.

91
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,400
Okay.

92
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,500
I want to order something, too.

93
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,300
What do you want?

94
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,500
Do you know how to make Buddha Jumping Over the Wall?
(T/N: A dish that's considered "high-end" in China and Taiwan)

95
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,700
Buddha Jumping Over the Wall?

96
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,900
That's too hard.

97
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:58,900
Do you want to eat Buddha Jumping Over the Wall?

98
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,800
No.

99
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,600
Have you tried it before, Yo Yo?

100
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,100
The Buddha inside will jump out.

101
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,900
Professor, I bought a lunchbox for you.

102
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,800
Okay.

103
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,200
Eat it while it's hot.

104
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,000
He really has made my tastes spoiled.

105
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,200
Daddy!

106
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,700
Let's go eat Korean food tonight, okay?

107
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,100
We had it for two days already. How about something else?

108
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,200
No.

109
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,600
Should we order pizza?

110
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,500
What do you want to eat?

111
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,600
How about pizza?

112
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,500
No.

113
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,000
I want Korean food no matter what.

114
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,200
Okay.

115
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,500
Shi Ke Yo,

116
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,400
look at you.

117
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,000
You haven't even finished your pudding.

118
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,500
You're even throwing your sketchbook around. Hurry and pick it up.

119
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:16,000
You're the same. You throw your books all over the place.

120
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,600
Fine. I'll pick them up, all right?

121
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,300
Hurry and tidy up.

122
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:33,400
Without Brother Xiao Fei here, you make everything into a big mess.

123
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,200
You're the same.

124
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,900
You dare hit me?

125
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,600
You dare hit me?

126
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,200
Daddy, call Brother Xiao Fei.

127
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,100
Ask him to come back.

128
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,500
Well? Have you decided?

129
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,900
I'm meeting the organizer next month.

130
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:10,800
Do you want to come?

131
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,200
I haven't decided yet.

132
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,600
So, you didn't ask me out here today to talk about this?

133
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,300
Hey, let me ask you something.

134
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:24,400
Have you ever felt like something was missing from your life

135
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,600
and then felt like nothing was meaningful?

136
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,500
Yes.

137
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,800
When I left home during my freshman year in college,

138
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,700
at that time I felt

139
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,400
"Wow! It's so carefree!"

140
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,000
Afterward, when a week had passed, I realized I had no money.

141
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,200
And I also didn't have clean clothes to change into,

142
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,600
Then, I really felt that life is really meaningless.

143
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,800
I think I missed my mom the most.

144
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,400
Without my mom,

145
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,700
I felt like

146
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,700
life was just black and white.

147
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,000
Who's talking to you about that?

148
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,100
If that's not it,

149
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,100
then what did you mean?

150
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,400
I'm not sure.

151
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,500
I don't know how to explain it.

152
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,400
It's just... that someone's missing from my side

153
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,800
and I'm not used to it.

154
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:10,400
Oh, you're not used to being divorced from Zhou Xin Ru. Right?

155
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,700
How is that possible?

156
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,900
It's not like you don't know our situation.

157
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,100
Our divorce was a relief for both of us.

158
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:18,900
So, what is it

159
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,100
that you're not used to?

160
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,700
I'm not used

161
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,200
to not eating the food he makes.

162
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,500
Not used to having a messy house.

163
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,500
Not used to not finding what I need.

164
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,400
Not used to not having him by my side.

165
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,800
So it's like this.

166
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,900
Like what?

167
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,300
I need to go home first.

168
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:50,800
Yo Yo is waiting for me.

169
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,700
Thanks.

170
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,900
Daddy, where exactly did Brother Xiao Fei go?

171
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,200
He's still resting.

172
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,900
I've missed him for 100 days already.

173
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,000
100 days?

174
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,300
You're back?

175
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,900
Brother Xiao Fei!

176
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,400
Where did you go?

177
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,900
I was waiting for you here at home.

178
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,900
I bought a lot of pudding for you. Do you want some?

179
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:12,800
Yes.

180
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,800
Are you making dinner?

181
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,300
Let's make it together.

182
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,300
Okay. Let's do it.

183
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,300
Give me the spoon.

184
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,700
I want to add it.

185
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,100
Why are you stealing my work spoon?

186
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,000
You're better?

187
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,800
Yes.

188
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,700
The doctor said it's fine as long as I avoid any vigorous movements.

189
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,600
Aren't you afraid of your wound being squeezed when you bend over?

190
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,800
Hurry and cook. I'm hungry.

191
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,700
I'll do it.

192
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,000
It's too salty.

193
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,900
It's too salty?

194
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,400
Let me try it.

195
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,800
It really is a bit salty.

196
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,700
Wait a moment.

197
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,900
It should be better now.

198
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:48,800
Try it.

199
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,500
How is it?

200
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,500
It's all right now.

201
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,200
My cooking's not bad, right?

202
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,700
I'll need to drink more to decide.

203
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,500
I can clean up.

204
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,700
Go and help Yo Yo with her homework.

205
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,800
If she can't finish her homework by herself,

206
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,100
what will she be able to do in the future?

207
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,000
You've never helped her with her homework before?

208
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,100
Is that not okay?

209
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,100
Daddy, it's too big.

210
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,800
You need to cut it smaller like 1 cm.

211
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,600
Only 1 cm?

212
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,600
Yes.

213
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,500
Slowly, slowly...

214
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,300
Gosh, Daddy, you broke it.

215
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,800
Why are we cutting strips anyway?

216
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,400
This is using different color strips to

217
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,000
train a child's knowledge of colors and grouping abilities.

218
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,300
If the focus is on the grouping,

219
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,600
why are we wasting so much time cutting strips?

220
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,900
It's to learn how to use the scissors' power.

221
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,000
Where is Daddy going?

222
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,000
Is he perhaps angry?

223
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,100
Angry?

224
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,400
Look.

225
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,900
Wow.

226
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,200
This does the trick, right?

227
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,400
Tools may be dead but humans are alive.

228
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,600
Daddy, it's too small.

229
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,900
I can't stick it on.

230
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,300
I'll do it.

231
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,400
Give it to me.

232
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
See? It's not sticking, right?

233
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,900
It'll stick.

234
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,300
Here. Let me do it.

235
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,900
Yes, give it to Brother Xiao Fei.

236
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:13,900
Let me try.

237
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,100
Wow, this is impossible. You made them too small.

238
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,000
What is this?

239
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,900
I'll smear the glue all over.

240
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,900
Yes, like that.

241
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,500
And then, you guys can sprinkle the bits on.

242
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,300
Yo Yo is so smart.

243
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,000
Okay.

244
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,100
We'll sprinkle them on.

245
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:26,800
Let's sprinkle them, on the count of three.

246
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,400
Okay.

247
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,700
1, 2, 3. Yeah!

248
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,000
I'll just think of it as a nice dream.

249
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,600
Actually, it's not bad if I think about it from a different perspective.

250
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,300
He needs a caretaker.

251
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,300
I can do the job.

252
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,000
It's a win-win situation.

253
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,300
Then, what about your feelings for him?

254
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,400
Are you just going to ignore them?

255
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,900
It's better than telling him.

256
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,400
He was married.

257
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,700
He has a kid.

258
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,900
It's impossible between us.

259
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,500
As long as I can stay like this now and get a little happiness,

260
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,500
I'll be content.

261
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:31,500
You make it sound like it's a cohabiting game.

262
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,800
Must you complain about me like this?

263
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,300
I'm just worried about you.

264
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,600
Dummy.

265
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,800
You're so young so why must you make yourself so miserable?

266
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,700
Why must you like an old, divorced man who gave birth to a kid?

267
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,300
It was Yo Yo's mother that gave birth to her.

268
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,700
Who cares about that?

269
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,100
You have to promise me...

270
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,300
That you'll come to find me no matter how bad you feel.

271
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,100
You definitely can't repeat what happened in Year One of high school.

272
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,200
Understand?

273
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,000
I understand.

274
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,400
Thank you.

275
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,700
Give me a hug.

276
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,100
Let go of that girl.

277
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,700
Split up! Split up! Split up!

278
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,600
You two, split up now.

279
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,600
Split up!

280
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,700
What on earth? I hugged him, not the other way around.

281
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,700
Then, please let go of this guy.

282
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,700
All right.

283
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:37,400
It's too late being jealous now. You're destined for heartbreak.

284
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,100
Heartbreak?

285
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,200
You like Xiao Fei, right?

286
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,500
What?

287
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,500
Me?

288
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,800
- Do you really...
- No!

289
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:49,300
Stop pretending. I knew a long time ago.

290
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,700
You joined the Drama Club because you wanted to pursue Xiao Fei.

291
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,000
Who told you that?

292
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,000
Don't tell me it was Luo Zhi Qiang.

293
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,700
That's right.

294
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,700
But he said you told him.

295
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,100
He made me promise not to tell anyone.

296
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,400
Ye Zi, there must be a misunderstanding.

297
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,100
No way. Luo Zhi Qiang even swore that everything was true.

298
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,200
No way.

299
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,000
You're speechless now, right?

300
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,800
Don't worry. I'm an easy-going person.

301
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,900
Besides, I fully support the love between crew members.

302
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,900
It will help with your drama performance

303
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,600
and deepen your relationship.

304
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,500
Wait, if I'm to pursue someone, then I'd pursue you first.

305
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,800
Who did you say?

306
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,200
Me?

307
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:43,100
I've been pursuing you. Will you let me pursue you?

308
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,700
Ye Zi!

309
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,500
You can't bully her.

310
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,100
However you see it, she's the one bullying me. All right?

311
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,000
Ye Zi! Ye Wen Ling!

312
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,700
I'm home.

313
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,500
I'm home.

314
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:49,100
Ke Yo brought an injured classmate to the nurse's office.

315
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,700
She's a thoughtful child.

316
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,400
Of course. My daughter is the best.

317
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:01,300
Ke Yo is a picky eater. She doesn't eat corn and bell peppers.

318
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,600
I'm sure, Teacher, you also have things you don't like to eat.

319
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,800
For instance, I don't like bean sprouts.

320
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,400
There are many kinds of food.

321
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,900
She can eat other things. No need to worry.

322
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,100
Where's Yo Yo?

323
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,900
Do you know what happened to Yo Yo today?

324
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,900
What right do you have to be a father?

325
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:47,400
Daddy, you keep going the wrong way. We're definitely going to lose.

326
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,700
No way. We have Brother Xiao Fei.

327
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,000
Yes, I'm here.

328
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,700
We'll definitely be first place.

329
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,900
You're not old at all. You're a handsome uncle.

330
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:06,900
Right, Yo Yo?

331
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,600
Yes. Daddy is the most handsome.

332
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,900
Yo Yo, you have food all over your mouth.

333
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,100
You're the same.

334
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,900
You're back.

335
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,100
Don't move around.

336
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,100
It's fine.

337
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,300
Thanks.

338
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,900
Then, I'm going home now.

339
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,900
There aren't any trains left. Stay here for the night.

340
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,600
It's okay. I usually ride a UBike when there are no trains.
(A bike from rental kiosks around Taipei City)

341
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,400
I want you to stay.

342
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,400
Don't say things like that so randomly.

343
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,000
You'll mislead people like us that way,

344
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,600
and make us expect things unnecessarily.

345
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,700
Then, just expect it.

346
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:46,100
What if I told you I purposely wanted you to expect it?

347
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:47,900
Teacher.

348
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,500
Isn't it too despicable to be calling me "Teacher" right now?

349
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,500
But you are my teacher.

350
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,000
I am.

351
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,800
Teacher, I'm a guy.

352
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,600
I can see that.

353
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,900
I'll tell my mom.

354
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,600
You should tell Sister Juan.

355
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,800
Shi Yi Jie.

356
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,000
You do like me.

357
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,400
Daddy!

358
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,300
Daddy!

359
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:23,000
[I have something on this morning. Please take Yo Yo to school. Thank you. - Fei Sheng Zhe]

360
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,200
So you're trying to use this method to avoid me?

361
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,900
The wills this time have greatly improved.

362
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,900
Some of you even said

363
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:37,100
that you finally understood the purpose of a will halfway through writing them.

364
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:40,100
The first time you helped your mom wash dishes.

365
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,300
Students,

366
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,000
I'm not planning on encouraging you.

367
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,700
But I hope there will be a second time, a third time.

368
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:52,600
Maybe even an upgrade into doing other housework.

369
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:57,300
I believe, those who are serious about writing their will

370
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:00,200
will realize that the will is not just homework,

371
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,200
but also a reflection and review of your current life.

372
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,500
You're reminding the living "you" right now

373
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,300
to cherish and live in the moment.

374
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:12,900
Grab hold of the people and things you cherish. Don't let them slip away.

375
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,300
Remember.

376
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,800
The most important things

377
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,600
all come by chance and not by will.

378
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,100
Once it appears before you,

379
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,900
don't be shy and grab onto it bravely.

380
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,000
What happens later, talk about it then.

381
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Never worry about an unpredictable tomorrow

382
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,300
and miss the current

383
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,600
wonderful moment that is placed in front of you.

384
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,600
So, Shi Yi Jie confessed to you?

385
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,800
Not really.

386
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,000
He just wanted me to expect more.

387
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Huh? Expect more?

388
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:56,600
Why is this old uncle so hard to understand?

389
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,300
But what he said in class just now,

390
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,600
sort of means that. Right?

391
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,100
I also don't know.

392
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,600
Then what happened? What happened after the "maybe" confession?

393
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,400
Daddy!

394
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,400
Daddy! Daddy!

395
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,300
Are you okay?

396
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,800
I really should go home now.

397
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:44,000
I'll forgive you for running away.

398
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,700
But then you quietly went back to make him breakfast the next morning?

399
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:51,300
Fei Sheng Zhe, do you know how the ostrich died?

400
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,600
It was shot by a gun?

401
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,100
It died because it stuck its head in the ground for too long.

402
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,800
Do you think this is like playing hide-and-seek?

403
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,500
Or maybe Harry Potter's invisible tent?

404
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,700
It was a cloak.

405
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,800
Who cares what it is.

406
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,400
The first step to solving a problem

407
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,100
is to face it, okay?

408
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,200
I know.

409
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,800
- Then, why are you still--
- Ye Zi!

410
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,600
I'm leaving first.

411
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,600
Hey, Ye Zi.

412
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,800
Don't come any closer!

413
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,400
Ye Zi!

414
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,000
Stay right there!

415
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,100
Hey, Ye Zi. Where are you going?

416
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,000
Stop following me!

417
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,900
What do I need to do to get her heart?

418
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,600
You just need to run a lot faster.

419
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,700
Did you forget?

420
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,700
She's our school's track representative.

421
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,800
How am I supposed to catch up with her?

422
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,300
Good luck, okay?

423
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,500
Good luck to you, too.

424
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,200
Hello?

425
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,300
Hello.

426
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:48,400
May I know if Mr. Shi Yi Jie is in the Research office?

427
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,300
He's in a meeting right now. He'll be back pretty late.

428
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,200
That's great. No, I mean,

429
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,900
I'll go find him later then.

430
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:56,800
Okay.

431
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,700
Okay, thank you.

432
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:58,700
Thank you.

433
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,200
Weren't you not in here?

434
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,600
If I didn't tell the assistant to say that, would you have come?

435
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,700
You tricked me.

436
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,100
Welcome to the adult world.

437
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,700
How long did you think you could hide?

438
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,700
I don't know what I should do with you.

439
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,200
Why are you so cute?

440
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,400
I didn't expect you to like me that much.

441
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,000
I never said that I liked you.

442
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:12,600
You didn't say it. But your actions are clear enough.

443
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:19,800
You want to avoid me but you're still worried about Yo Yo and me.

444
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,400
So, you secretly came to my house,

445
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,100
made breakfast, and even left a note.

446
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:29,200
Fei Sheng Zhe, you're really conflicted.

447
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,700
Your conflict is making me

448
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,500
very touched.

449
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,500
Is admitting it, that hard?

450
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,200
Or are you afraid?

451
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,200
Look at me.

452
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,800
Look at me.

453
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,900
I'm not like the senior who let you down and made you sad.

454
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,900
You know that, right?

455
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:41,200
Then, just think carefully about how to answer me.

456
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Let me tell you first though.

457
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,200
I won't accept no for an answer.

458
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,100
Then, what do you want me to think about?

459
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:41,200
Daddy, did you fight with Brother Xiao Fei?

460
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,100
No.

461
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:45,800
Then, why did he leave right after he finished cooking?

462
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,500
Brother Xiao Fei's busy lately.

463
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,500
He'll be back in a few days.

464
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,400
Really?

465
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,300
Yes.

466
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,100
Yo Yo,

467
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,400
do you like Brother Xiao Fei?

468
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,700
I do. I'm going to marry him in the future.

469
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,100
You can't.

470
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,500
Why not?

471
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,600
Because he already pinky-promised me

472
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,600
that he'll marry me.

473
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:16,200
Really? But only a man and woman can get married.

474
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,600
That's not true.

475
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,500
Two people who love each other can get married.

476
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,700
They can live together and grow old together.

477
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:25,700
Then, I'm going to marry Wu Yi Qian.

478
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,200
Who is Wu Yi Qian?

479
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:33,400
He's the one who protects me

480
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,000
whenever Xiao Pin Yi bullies me.

481
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,400
Okay. When you grow up

482
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,800
and if you still want to marry him, you can.

483
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,800
How long will it take before I grow up?

484
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,500
You're a grown-up when you're as tall as I am.

485
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,700
What? That's still going to be a long time.

486
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,300
Isn't that great?

487
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:51,500
It means you get to stay with me for a long time.

488
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,100
Let's eat.

489
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,400
Eat some egg.

490
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,900
The carrots are so bitter.

491
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,200
But it's good for the eyes.

492
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,500
You want good eyes, right?

493
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,600
Yes.

494
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,300
Good girl.

495
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,800
But you're not eating any carrots either.

496
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,200
All right. We'll eat them together on the count of three.

497
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,100
One...

498
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,900
One point two...

499
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,000
Two... Three!

500
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:38,200
Mom, you don't have to work this morning?

501
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,300
I switched shifts with a colleague.

502
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,900
Why did you switch?

503
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Good morning, Sister Juan.

504
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,500
Good morning, Grandma Nurse. This is for you.

505
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,300
Oh, thank you.

506
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:01,600
I came here to play with Xiao Fei.

507
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,500
What are you two doing here?

508
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,800
Ah Jie,

509
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,800
I haven't agreed yet.

510
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,300
It's because I couldn't wait.

511
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:16,300
I should have told Yo Yo to call you Big Sister.

512
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:19,200
You and your mouth are still as bad as before.

513
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,600
A person's true nature is hard to change.

514
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,100
So, did you come today

515
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,400
to ask for my permission

516
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,000
or to argue with me?

517
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:31,400
It's actually an overdue visit.

518
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,600
As it should be.

519
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,300
Brother Xiao Fei, I can't hear anything.

520
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,400
Shh.

521
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,500
Why Sheng Zhe?

522
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,500
I also don't know.

523
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,900
When I finally realized it,

524
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,400
I didn't want to let him go anymore.

525
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,400
You're still the same.

526
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,300
As long as it's something you really care about,

527
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,200
you want to keep it close to you.

528
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,600
I don't want to lose anything else.

529
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,600
You know it, too.

530
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,400
I have already lost too much.

531
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,400
Go over there and wait for me, okay?

532
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,200
So, you only want to take my son to

533
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,700
fill the emptiness and loneliness you feel, because you need the warmth?

534
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,400
If that's the case, I won't agree.

535
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,700
Sister Juan,

536
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,000
I definitely won't allow anyone to say that about Sheng Zhe.

537
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,400
Even if it's you,

538
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,200
I won't be able to forgive it either.

539
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,100
So?

540
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,700
I really do cherish him.

541
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,800
I won't allow anyone to demean him

542
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,700
and that includes you.

543
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,900
If I didn't feel so strongly about this,

544
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,600
I wouldn't have come to see you today.

545
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,500
Sister Juan,

546
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:04,300
please allow me to date Sheng Zhe.

547
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,100
I'll make him happy.

548
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,100
I didn't know that you liked men.

549
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:21,700
After all, you were married once and even have a daughter.

550
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,800
To be honest, I didn't know it myself.

551
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:30,000
I just know that I like him

552
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,300
and that he happens to be a guy.

553
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:35,100
Do you think by saying that, I'll be reassured?

554
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:40,900
Ah Jie, I don't ever want Sheng Zhe to get hurt again.

555
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,000
Before, because of my negligence, due to work,

556
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,300
he suffered a great deal, emotionally.

557
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,200
He was even physically bullied.

558
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,400
Now, he's finally moved on from all that pain.

559
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:54,100
I don't want him to suffer like that again.

560
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:56,500
I can't promise you anything

561
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:59,300
because the person I need to make the commitment to is him.

562
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,500
This is a fruit knife.

563
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,900
I hope it will not have any other use.

564
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,500
Don't worry.

565
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,800
I won't let you have the chance to use it for any other purpose.

566
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,500
Then, promise me something.

567
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,900
What is it?

568
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:25,000
Before Sheng Zhe turns 20,

569
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,600
any excessive physical interactions are forbidden.

570
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,400
Sister Juan,

571
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,300
Sheng Zhe is already of adult age.

572
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,900
This is my testing of you.

573
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,300
Do you understand?

574
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,800
Sister Juan,

575
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:49,000
what if we accidentally have a bit, a little--

576
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,600
It's forbidden starting right now!

577
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,200
Sister Juan. Sister Juan, relax.

578
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,000
Don't mess with a mother's conviction. Do you understand me?

579
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I understand.

580
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,300
Grandma Nurse, what's wrong with Daddy?

581
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,700
Nothing. Nothing's wrong.

582
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:01,700
Come.

583
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:04,300
I'll cut some apples for you, all right?

584
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:04,800
Okay.

585
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,400
Do you like apples?

586
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,200
All right.

587
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,500
I'll give you some apples.

588
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,200
Mom.

589
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:16,100
This guy here is a bad apple all over.

590
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:18,400
Don't let him walk all over you.

591
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,600
Thank you, Mom.

592
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,600
May I also have one?

593
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,400
Okay.

594
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Hey, did you see my hairdryer?

595
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,900
Goodnight, Yo Yo.

596
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,400
What are you doing?

597
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,800
Are you a child?

598
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,500
I'm seven today.

599
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,900
Dry it yourself then.

600
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,400
Stop. You're splattering water all over me.

601
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,600
Why aren't you talking?

602
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,300
What did you say?

603
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,800
Why aren't you talking?

604
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,700
I was just thinking.

605
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,600
The change in my mood today was huge.

606
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,200
It was like sitting in a roller coaster.

607
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,400
I didn't think you'd come to my house

608
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,200
and say all those things to my mom.

609
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,500
I know I should have given you more time,

610
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,900
but I didn't want to.

611
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,800
While you were still wavering,

612
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,100
I wanted to block all your ways of escape,

613
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:38,600
so you could only pick the one road left ahead

614
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,200
and that is to accept me.

615
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:44,600
This is an adult being despicable.

616
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,500
You really are dark.

617
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,800
I never said I was a good guy.

618
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,100
It's just that there's not much that makes me this determined.

619
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:00,000
And now it's already too late for you to regret it.

620
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,300
Well, I guess... I'll just have to reluctantly accept.

621
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,400
Okay.

622
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,100
Hey!

623
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,400
Don't forget what you promised my mom?

624
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,400
Did I?

625
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,700
What did I promise your mom?

626
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:15,400
How come I don't remember anything? Did I promise her something?

627
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,300
Should I call her so she can remind you?

628
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,900
Hey, Fei Sheng Zhe. Stop messing around.

629
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,100
You get scared, too. Huh?

630
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:23,600
Did you forget what the fruit knife is for?

631
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,700
Fine. Forget it. Forget it.

632
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,600
Be good.

633
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:43,500
Are you really going to pass up the opportunity to go to Mali?

634
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,300
I don't change my decisions once they're made.

635
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,300
You can come to me if you need help with any identifications.

636
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,800
But I'll charge you an advisory fee.

637
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,000
I know.

638
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,500
That's why I always say,

639
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,400
why marry when you're an archaeologist?

640
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,200
Why have a kid after you're married?

641
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,400
Why get a divorce after having a kid?

642
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,200
Look at how nice it is to be like me.

643
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,400
No ties holding me down and no burdens.

644
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,600
- Jiang Zhao Peng,
- Hmm?

645
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,900
Yo Yo is not a burden to me.

646
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,600
Shi Yi Jie,

647
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,700
I need you.

648
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,800
Don't give up on your dream.

649
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:24,600
Dreams change as time goes by and you meet different people.

650
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,900
What is most important right now, might not be so in the future.

651
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,700
What you thought, in the past, was important,

652
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,500
might not be so now.

653
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:37,700
Nonsense. It wouldn't be called a dream if it changes.

654
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:41,200
If you meet someone who truly matters to you,

655
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,900
trust me, you'll change, too.

656
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,600
Although it's not what it initially looks like,

657
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,100
the determination remains the same.

658
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,200
It seems like I won't be able to convince you.

659
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:58,500
The last time you turned me down,

660
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:01,800
your face said, "I'm unwilling."

661
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,100
But this time, it's different.

662
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:05,900
Your face right now is carved with, "I'm willing with all my heart."

663
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:11,900
Are you sure the important person you met

664
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,600
is truly that important?

665
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:22,000
Why did you set an alarm? Do you need to do something?

666
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,100
I have to go home to eat.

667
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,800
He said he would cook all my favorite dishes.

668
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,400
Oh, damn.

669
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,800
I didn't even see you sparkle this bright when you were married.

670
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,300
Is that so?

671
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,400
Yes. It's my first time ever seeing you like this.

672
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,200
It's as if you actually met your fated love while swimming around in the sea of love.

673
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,000
There's no saving you anymore.

674
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,200
You finish it.

675
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:48,900
I'm home.

676
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,500
You're home!

677
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,600
Dinner will be ready in a bit.

678
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,800
Why are you here?

679
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,600
Daddy, let me tell it to you!

680
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,100
Mommy said she'll be living with us from now on.

681
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,900
Just wait a bit. The food's almost ready.

682
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:14,200
Yo Yo, come and help me.

683
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,000
Okay. Bye-bye.

684
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,000
You're so smart, using a plate.

685
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,400
The pot's ready. Be careful.

686
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,100
It's time for hot pot.

687
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,800
♫ The past where I'm thinking of you ♫

688
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:33,000
♫ Is still in your memories ♫

689
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,800
♫ No need to ask, I understand ♫

690
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,800
♫ What kind of excuse ♫

691
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:45,600
♫ Can be used ♫

692
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:50,300
♫ So I don't have to be in this intersection ♫

693
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:53,000
♫ Too many people talking about ♫

694
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,600
♫ Right or wrong ♫

695
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:02,000
♫ It has isolated our feelings ♫

696
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,100
♫ Again and again, the cowardly me ♫

697
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:10,100
♫ Wants to go back ♫

698
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:14,800
♫ Who can give me this courage ♫

699
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,700
♫ We never stop learning ♫

700
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:20,800
♫ Learning how to cherish ♫

701
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:26,700
♫ Never again letting anything make me regret when it's too late ♫

702
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:29,800
♫ Look at my eyes ♫

703
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:34,200
♫ Come close to my heart ♫

704
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,900
♫ Oh ♫
