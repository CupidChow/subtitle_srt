[HIStory 2- Crossing Boundaries]

6
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,600
Why is it like this?

7
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,500
That's what I want to know, too.

8
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,600
It's unreasonable.

9
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,100
Yes, I also think this is pretty unreasonable.

10
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,600
Not only are you daydreaming in class but you're fidgeting non-stop.

11
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,200
Keep it down!

12
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,600
Are you awake now?

13
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,500
Go and stand outside.

14
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,400
Okay, open your books and turn to page 59.

15
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,200
Look at Section Three: Planetary Motion.

16
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,800
Kepler's third law of planetary motion,

17
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,900
also known as the Law of Periods.

18
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,500
The different planets that revolve around the sun

19
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,800
The square of T's motion...

20
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,600
What are you doing here?

21
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,600
It's class time right now.

22
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,200
Aren't you also here?

23
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,400
Year Three students have different schedules, to begin with.

24
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,900
I have a study hall this period.

25
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,100
Hurry and go back to class.

26
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,300
I still have to stand for punishment if I go back,

27
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,600
so there's no point in going back.

28
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,600
Standing punishment?

29
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,000
It's break time.

30
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,600
This is for you.

31
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,800
Go home and make these into flashcards

32
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,300
so you can carry them around with you.

33
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,600
Memorize the vocabulary also as you go along.

34
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,000
You made all these for me?

35
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,100
Obviously.

36
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,800
Just think of it as a review.

37
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,800
It's killing two birds with one stone.

38
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,800
What's the matter?

39
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,100
That...

40
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:50,300
I heard Zeng Zheng Fan is trying to pick holes in our training application.

41
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,700
It's all right. Coach helped put in a good word for us.

42
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,900
So the Director said we could have training if everyone passes the term exams.

43
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,200
He's just doing it to spite me.

44
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,300
He knows my grades are bad.

45
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,400
Don't overthink it.

46
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,600
Even if that's the case,

47
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,800
students are supposed to study more.

48
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,100
You should at least pass your exams

49
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,000
to make your mom proud.

50
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,500
Why do you guys have to have this training event?

51
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,000
All the seniors in past years have done this.

52
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,300
Also, through the few days of intensive training,

53
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,100
plus the interactions of living with each other,

54
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,800
you get to know each other better and it's a good way of building teamwork.

55
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,900
Sometimes, there are gains that you haven't thought about.

56
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,900
Gains?

57
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,400
For example, getting a girlfriend.

58
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,800
That's how He Cheng En and Xiao Xiao became a couple.

59
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,200
They...

60
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,800
They are a couple?

61
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,000
Not you and He Cheng En?

62
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:55,200
He Cheng En and me?

63
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,500
(delete)

64
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,800
Haven't you laughed enough?

65
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,700
Why did you think that me and... me and Cheng En?

66
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,300
Who knows?

67
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,400
(delete)

68
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,700
What are you laughing for?

69
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,700
How would I know about her fondness for boys' love?

70
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,200
That's why it's very troubling

71
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,100
for a guy to have a girlfriend who's always trying to turn him gay.

72
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,700
What about you, then?

73
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,200
Do you have

74
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,800
a girlfriend?

75
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,200
Me?

76
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,200
Between studying and planning training sessions,

77
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,200
I'm already busy enough.

78
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,800
I don't have time to think about that.

79
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,000
You haven't even thought about it a little?

80
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,300
Perhaps I'm like you,

81
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,400
still waiting for the person that, when I see them,

82
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,000
will make me feel like it.

83
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,000
Look!

84
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,800
What's Wang Zhen Wen doing?

85
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,900
Thanks for helping me move all this stuff.

86
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,000
You're a really good person.

87
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,700
It's something I should do. Guys are supposed to help with these things.

88
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,000
You're very thoughtful.

89
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,800
By the way,

90
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,500
you and Wang Zhen Wen are both on the volleyball team.

91
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,400
Is the training hard?

92
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,600
It's not too bad.

93
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,300
Then...

94
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,100
Can I come watch sometimes?

95
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,100
Of course.

96
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,800
If you're free... then, of course, you can.

97
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,500
Hey, what are you doing?

98
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,300
Do you and your brother like the same girl?

99
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,400
Who would like her?

100
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,200
Then why are you following them?

101
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,200
Also,

102
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,200
lately, you've been giving your brother the cold shoulder.

103
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,800
Is it perhaps, because you brothers turned into love rivals?

104
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,000
If you're talking about love rivals, then it's that girl.

105
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,200
Girl?

106
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,210
What does that mean?

107
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,500
What's really going on between the two of you?

108
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,100
I know it's very strange for me to be acting like this,

109
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,800
but it's Zhen Wu that I like.

110
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,800
Ever since Year Three in middle school, I've realized that I liked him.

111
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,500
And...

112
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,800
And what?

113
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,600
And I even dreamt that I kissed him and--

114
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,100
But he's your older brother.

115
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,700
We're not related by blood.

116
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,000
It's just that my dad married his mom,

117
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,600
so we became brothers.

118
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,400
Don't ever let Xiao Xiao find out about this.

119
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,800
What will happen if Senior Xiao Xiao finds out?

120
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,500
You and Zhen Wu will become cover models for her comic.

121
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,300
Huh?

122
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,100
That's not the main point.

123
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,300
The main point is what do you plan on doing now?

124
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,800
What else can I do?

125
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,000
He already has a girlfriend now.

126
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,900
If I can avoid them, then that's what I'll do.

127
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:47,500
Who knew that he'd follow me closer than ever.

128
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,000
I joined the volleyball team

129
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,800
because I thought that

130
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,400
maybe he'd be like he was before,

131
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,200
always caught up in practice, so then he'd ignore me.

132
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,600
It's not like you don't know Zhen Wu protects you like a real brother.

133
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,600
It'd be strange if he didn't.

134
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,200
But it's just because

135
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,600
he feels that he owes me something.

136
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,000
So he feels he must be extra nice to me.

137
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
What does he owe you?

138
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,300
Back in Year One of middle school,

139
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,100
we lived together

140
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,200
and we had a good relationship, too.

141
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:24,000
I was glad to have an older brother

142
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,500
and we went to school together every day.

143
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:30,200
One day, we had an argument

144
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,000
and he left me alone to go to volleyball practice.

145
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,600
But in the end, I got kidnapped

146
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,600
and even got injured.

147
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,300
How can you still laugh after something like that happened?

148
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,800
If I can laugh it means I've put all of it behind me.

149
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:56,400
He's always thought that it was his fault.

150
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,400
So afterward, he became extremely nice to me,

151
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:08,400
to the point where he even gave up volleyball which he loved so much,

152
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,400
just to be around me every minute.

153
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It would have been great if I hadn't found out that I liked him.

154
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,700
Then, I wouldn't be in so much pain right now.

155
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,800
I'm fine.

156
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,700
Maybe he'll get even closer with that girl

157
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,700
and then he won't have time to look after me, then I'll be free.

158
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,100
Wang Zhen Wen,

159
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,000
you can only be free after you let go

160
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,500
of your feelings for your older brother.

161
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,600
I'll try my best.

162
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,400
I'm going back to class now.

163
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,600
What do you think about the fact that Zhen Wen likes Zhen Wu?

164
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,900
Xia Yu Hao,

165
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,200
if you look down on your friend because of this,

166
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,400
I'll be very disappointed in you.

167
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,000
Of course, I won't.

168
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,600
So, would it possible for you to like a guy?

169
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,300
The emphasis on liking someone depends on the person,

170
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,200
regardless of whether they're a girl or a boy.

171
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,900
So, it's possible?

172
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,300
I don't need to answer that question.

173
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,400
You're a guy, be more straightforward with your words.

174
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,000
You're always fooling around, so boring.

175
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,400
If you don't answer me,

176
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,800
on the term exams, I might...

177
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
What about the term exams?

178
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,400
If you dare fail even one subject in the exams,

179
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,400
I'll beat you to death with a volleyball.

180
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,400
Seniors are like wicked stepmothers.

181
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:18,500
I can't believe they gave me an entire year's worth of log books and told me to organize them.

182
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,900
It's almost term exams, did they not think of that?

183
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,400
Sorry.

184
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,900
Oh, it's you.

185
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,800
I need to talk to you.

186
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,100
Let's go home together.

187
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,500
Uh... I'm going to meet Senior Xiao Xiao.

188
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,000
I already told her something happened at home so we have to leave.

189
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,300
You've been avoiding me recently.

190
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,400
Did I do something wrong?

191
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:32,000
Just tell me directly, don't keep it all inside.

192
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,400
I wonder how Xia Yu Hao is doing on his exams.

193
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,200
Passed!

194
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,700
Passed!

195
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,400
Yes! That's great!

196
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,800
I just knew our guys on the team are not only physically fit,

197
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,800
their brains aren't simple either!

198
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,000
Wait a minute.

199
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,800
This only applies to us, okay?

200
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,700
Xia Yu Hao and the rest might not have done as well on the exams.

201
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,200
Especially Xia Yu Hao.

202
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,300
You have a point there.

203
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,200
Xia Yu Hao.

204
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,000
How did you guys do on the exams?

205
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,900
How many classes did you fail?

206
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,800
Jia Jun...

207
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,400
All passed!

208
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,200
That's good!

209
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,000
That's really good!

210
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,800
Everyone deserves a round of applause.

211
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,300
Well done!

212
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,200
All right, everyone. Saturday morning at 6:00 a.m.

213
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,400
gather here in front of the school.

214
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,900
Get some good rest tonight.

215
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:19,700
Bye-bye, Captain.

216
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,900
Everyone, you've worked hard!

217
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:21,700
You've worked hard. You've worked hard.

218
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,300
Bye, senior.

219
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,900
Get some rest.

220
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,800
Well done.

221
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,900
Senior, did we really pay the fee?

222
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,400
Catch up, Xia Yu Hao.

223
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,900
The Captain is here.

224
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:52,800
Hey, Captain.

225
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,200
This place is terrible.

226
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:54,900
Xuan.

227
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,200
I didn't see any convenience store as I was walking here

228
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,000
and there are too many mosquitoes.

229
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,100
Don't tell me there's no hot water for the shower tonight.

230
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,000
Coach.

231
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,800
You guys are chatting away very happily, huh?

232
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,800
Continue chatting.

233
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,500
You're not going to hurry inside?

234
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,700
Yes, Coach!

235
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,900
Move it! Move it!

236
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,800
Hurry!

237
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,600
Hurry!

238
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,600
Blocking exercise. Start!

239
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,400
- Yes!
- Yes!

240
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,600
Jump higher.

241
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,300
Go!

242
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,300
Jump higher.

243
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,000
Aren't I doing great?

244
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
And you're still fooling around?

245
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,400
Fighting!

246
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,500
Okay. That's good.

247
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,200
Again.

248
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,000
Okay, not bad.

249
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,400
Don't run into each other.

250
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,600
Is she really He Zhong Zhong?

251
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,000
She becomes a devil when it's about volleyball training.

252
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,700
She's even scarier than Senior Zi Xuan.

253
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,400
What?

254
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,400
You still have time to chit-chat?

255
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,400
Run ten laps around the court. Go!

256
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,100
Me?

257
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,000
Go on.

258
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,700
You deserved it.

259
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,800
Idiot, we don't even dare to talk.

260
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,600
You're still laughing?

261
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,200
Hurry! Move it. Move it.

262
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:14,900
Be more careful next time.

263
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,800
You're still laughing?

264
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,800
Your shoulder.

265
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,600
All right. That's good.

266
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,100
Jump higher.

267
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,400
Okay, not bad.

268
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,900
Okay, stop!

269
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:42,800
Starting now,

270
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,900
form teams of two to practice style A fastbreaks.

271
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,600
Yes!

272
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,000
Xia Yu Hao.

273
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,800
Do you dare to team with me and fight a bit?

274
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,400
Let's do it.

275
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:50,900
You sure?

276
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:51,300
Yes.

277
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,300
Get a ball, then.

278
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,500
This is not a fight.

279
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,900
You're on the same team.

280
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,900
Practice properly.

281
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,800
Yes, Coach.

282
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,800
Come on.

283
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,600
Do you actually know what style A fastbreaks are?

284
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,600
You should have asked if you didn't know.

285
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,300
If you asked, I would have told you. You'd know after I told you.

286
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,300
You're just over there--

287
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,200
Forget it. Anyway, style A fastbreak

288
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,600
is when I toss the ball to you, at the same time

289
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,700
you jump and hit the ball over.

290
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,300
Okay.

291
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,900
What are you two doing?

292
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,200
Do it again.

293
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,700
Yes.

294
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,600
Ready, go!

295
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,600
Xia Yu Hao, I didn't think that you'd actually be not bad.

296
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,000
Hey.

297
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,300
Did I do it properly this time?

298
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,000
You...

299
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,000
Qiu Zi Xuan trained him well.

300
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,000
Next team, continue.

301
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,700
The point of this is to not miss the ball.

302
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:09,700
All right, everyone.

303
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,100
From today on, we'll be sleeping here.

304
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,200
Here?

305
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,400
Stop complaining already.

306
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,500
Hurry up and move it. Move it!

307
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,000
It's not bad and you're still complaining?

308
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,700
Jia Jun, Jing Yang, Xiao Ji.

309
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,700
Yes.

310
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,200
You guys lay out the mattresses.

311
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:21,800
All right!

312
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,500
Da Ke, Xiao Jia.

313
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,400
Please use the chairs.

314
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,300
Okay.

315
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,300
The rest who are not doing anything,

316
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,200
just help wherever.

317
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,600
So this is the mattress?

318
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,600
What else would it be?

319
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,200
It's so dirty.

320
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,200
Say that again.

321
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,600
Move faster. Move faster.

322
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,500
Those who continue to complain will sleep on the bare floor.

323
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,000
Jing Yang wants to sleep on the floor.

324
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,400
Zhen Wen.

325
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,500
Hey, Jing Yang.

326
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,300
Yes?

327
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,500
Help me put Zi Xuan's mattress

328
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,600
near the toilet.

329
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,000
Senior, just leave that to me.

330
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,600
I leave this great responsibility to you then.

331
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,700
No problem, Captain.

332
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,800
Thanks, Senior.

333
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,800
Captain!

334
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:15,100
Then, will Coach Zhong Zhong and Xiao Xiao be sleeping here with us, too?

335
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,300
Did you say Zhong Zhong and Xiao Xiao?

336
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,600
Yes.

337
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,200
Come here. Come here.

338
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,200
- What did you say?
- It hurts. It hurts.

339
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:27,500
You want two pretty ladies to sleep here with us stinky guys?

340
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,000
You avoiding him like this, isn't it a bit too obvious?

341
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,590
-Pervert.
-Okay. Okay. Okay.

342
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:36,940
Stop thinking dirty. Sleep nicely.

343
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,000
Where is he?

344
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,500
Qiu Zi Xuan!

345
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,100
Qiu Zi Xuan!

346
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,800
Hey.

347
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,600
What's wrong?

348
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,300
I have a leg cramp.

349
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,100
Cramp?

350
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,900
Hang in there.

351
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,600
Ow!

352
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,500
Is it better now?

353
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,200
It doesn't hurt as much.

354
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,400
How about here?

355
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,400
It's all right.

356
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,300
I just occasionally get cramps in my lower leg.

357
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,700
How about here?

358
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:47,900
Qiu Zi Xuan, I think I...

359
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,000
It's shower time!

360
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,000
This place is huge.

361
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,200
Wow!

362
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,800
All right, everyone. Claim your own stall.

363
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,000
The one who showers the slowest will massage everyone.

364
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Let's shower together.

365
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,700
No. No way.

366
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,600
Jiang Jing Yang, shampoo.

367
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,400
It's okay. It's fine.

368
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,640
Senior, quit fooling around.

369
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,100
Okay.

370
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:23,200
But... we're in the guy's bathroom.

371
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,700
There shouldn't be any problems, right?

372
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,400
Oh, that's right. Yes.

373
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:33,600
I'm going to find Zhong Zhong and Xiao Xiao for a meeting.

374
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,700
But um...

375
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:39,300
Can you pick up my towel for me?

376
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,000
I don't think I can bend down that low because of my leg.

377
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,800
Towel?

378
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,300
Xia Yu Hao!

379
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:21,200
So you're here?

380
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,100
Aren't you going to shower?

381
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:26,000
I already showered.

382
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,400
Why are you running again after you have showered?

383
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,100
Are you crazy?

384
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,300
Did any of you see Zhen Wen and Zhen Wu?

385
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,000
No.

386
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,500
This is too awkward.

387
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,500
Why must it be now?

388
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,500
Are you okay?

389
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,000
I'm fine.

390
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,400
You're not mad, but you say I'm being annoying.

391
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,000
I just said it for no reason.

392
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,600
I don't think you're annoying.

393
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,000
I just wanted to train myself to be more independent.

394
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,900
Independent?

395
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,900
Don't you have a girlfriend now?

396
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:23,200
You need time to go on your dates.

397
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,500
That's why... I want to be... more independent.

398
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:30,000
Otherwise, what if I caused you to get dumped?

399
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,100
What's your girlfriend like?

400
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,100
Is she pretty?

401
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:47,000
If you're not busy, remember to introduce her to me,

402
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,000
or bring her home for dinner with Mom and Dad.

403
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,400
Ah... Is it too soon?

404
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,600
We're still in high school.

405
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,200
So lately, you've been thinking about these things?

406
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,000
That's right.

407
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,600
Or else what?

408
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,000
You're my younger brother.

409
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,200
Don't worry,

410
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,600
I'll take care of you.

411
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,800
I'm going to take a shower.

412
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,000
Was he really that great?

413
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,400
He was the best spiker for two years in a row.

414
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,900
For you.

415
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,700
You're gifting me a ball that belongs to the school?

416
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:34,000
That one's mine.

417
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,700
[Zi Xuan]

418
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,200
Ouch!

419
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,200
Just that kind, like you were instantly hit,

420
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,300
making you unable to take your eyes off of the person.

421
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:06,100
That person is the only thing in your eyes, just like...
♫ Loneliness is always easily,  ♫

422
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,400
There's someone you like?

423
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,500
Who is it? Tell me.
♫ Easily camouflaging  ♫

424
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,300
The bottom line is, I don't have those kinds of feelings for your sister.
♫  into independence ♫

425
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,100
My sister put so much effort into this. 
♫ Full of craziness,  ♫

426
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,600
I don't want to see her sad.
♫ it’s gradually becoming expired  ♫

427
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,600
- Let's go.
- What?

428
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,600
Where are we going?
♫ Slowly, ♫

429
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,700
Don't ask.
♫  we start to get close ♫

430
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:34,340
♫ I’ve crossed over this boundary ♫
♫ No one taking precautions ♫

431
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:39,720
♫ No matter who advances and who retreats ♫

432
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:45,530
♫ We are not different, just again and again we keep passing by ♫

433
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:50,510
♫ The few moments that might have intersected ♫

434
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:56,120
♫ You crossed over this boundary ♫
♫ It’s not a violation ♫

435
00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:01,620
♫ There won’t be any blame ♫

436
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:07,380
♫ Because love’s limit ♫
♫ Has already gone beyond understanding ♫

437
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:17,350
♫ Just let us go forward ♫
♫ Once I’ve crossed over, I won’t retreat ♫

438
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,700
(delete)

439
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,400
So it's like this.

440
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,500
Senior...

441
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:37,200
I'll definitely take you to the finals.

442
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,300
Is it too hot?

443
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,800
It's fine. Thank you.

444
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,100
They put your bed nearest to the door

445
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,400
because you didn't want to wake up the others, right?

446
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,600
Why'd you ask if you already knew the answer?

447
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:46,000
Is there no way to cure it?

448
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,400
This...

449
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,000
is already the best condition it'll be.

450
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,300
What?

451
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,500
I'm the one who got injured, not you.

452
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,200
Don't you want to be able to play again?

453
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,600
I'll go change the towel.

454
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,000
Senior...

455
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,200
Senior...

456
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,900
You've worked hard.

457
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,800
Thank you, Senior.

458
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,400
Senior...

459
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,800
Did I write it correctly here?

460
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,600
It looks all right to me.

461
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:39,500
Everyone, listen to me talk while you're resting.

462
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:42,800
In a few days, this special training will be over.

463
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,300
So, to reward you guys for all the effort you put in these few days,

464
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,700
I have prepared a massive gift for all of you.

465
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:50,000
What is it?

466
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,800
A practice competition with Ren He High School.

467
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,400
Wow! Yes!

468
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,300
They were one of the top four teams in Group A.

469
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,600
The Ren He High School whose team has excellent defensive skills?

470
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,600
It's a great chance for us to show our abilities.

471
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,100
Coach, how did you get to invite them?

472
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:06,800
My university senior is not just a supporting role in a drama.

473
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,600
Although he's a bit annoying,

474
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,000
he treats me very well.

475
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,300
Hey, Coach!

476
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,000
Wow!

477
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,300
Coach!

478
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,700
Focus!

479
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,600
We do not have a strong defense like Ren He,

480
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,600
so we can only depend on agility.

481
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,800
Zi Xuan!

482
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,700
Yes.

483
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,200
Next up, we need to strengthen our team. Jun Zhe.

484
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,300
Jun Zhe.

485
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,500
Yes.

486
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,700
You will be the attacker.

487
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,400
Hey, Senior.

488
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,200
I can do it.

489
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,500
Very good. Also...

490
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,400
Wang Zhen Wu,

491
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,800
you'll be the libero player.
(T/N: Best skilled defensive player who wears a contrasting jersey)

492
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,800
Okay.

493
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,900
Let me add something.

494
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,500
Our practice game with Ren He

495
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,500
is to help us gain some experience.

496
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,600
So...

497
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:48,500
as long as you have the skills, you can play.

498
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,300
Veterans, those playing in the first round,

499
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:53,100
you need to remember this.

500
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,400
You better watch out.

501
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,000
Don't get overshadowed by the rookies.

502
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,600
It'll look real ugly.

503
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,400
That's right. Those of you playing in the first round,

504
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,800
you better keep it tight!

505
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,000
We will, okay?

506
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,400
The same goes for the Captain.

507
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,300
The pressure is too much for me.

508
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,100
That's very good.

509
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:11,000
Then shouldn't you... prepare for training?!

510
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,300
Yes!

511
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,800
Those starting the game, start forming the formation first.

512
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,800
The rest of you will toss balls in from the other side.

513
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,300
Move fast!

514
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,700
Regarding the strategy for later...

515
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:23,700
Remember...

516
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:26,900
Hey, Junior! Xiao Jia.

517
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,600
The ball.

518
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,400
Rookie Xia,

519
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,800
why are you standing here?

520
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,500
You should be standing at position number two.

521
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:41,100
Number two. Number two!

522
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,400
Position number two...

523
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,000
Where is that?

524
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,300
Stop! Stop! Stop!

525
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,900
Zi Xuan.

526
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:56,000
Did you not teach him the rules of the game?

527
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,790
Do you understand the shifting of positions and the standing positions now?

528
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,800
Yes.

529
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,900
Also, during the game, you must never touch the net

530
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,600
and you also can't cross the boundary line,

531
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,800
especially with your legs.

532
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,100
You definitely can't do this.

533
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,700
And you can't do this either.

534
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,400
I can't do this.

535
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,000
Then, what about body parts other than the leg?

536
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,400
Anything above the legs.

537
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,100
Lower legs, thighs, body and arms.

538
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,300
You can only cross the boundary when you're saving a ball.

539
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:34,400
But if the ball crosses the boundary line, it's also a lost point.

540
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,500
I'm sorry.

541
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,800
I was too caught up in teaching you the techniques

542
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,600
that I forgot to teach you the rules.

543
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,200
That's okay.

544
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,900
It's still not too late.

545
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,600
That's right.

546
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,000
You still haven't answered my question from yesterday.

547
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,500
Do you really not want to play on the court again?

548
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,600
Even if it's just for five minutes?

549
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,600
Once a true ballplayer gets on the court,

550
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,000
he won't want to leave it.

551
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:03,300
It's true that I have lost the ability to be able to play on the court,

552
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,700
but it doesn't mean that I'm completely out of the game.

553
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:10,400
This is me now, I play with this.

554
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,500
Game strategies, volleyball training,

555
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,100
mobilizing the team,

556
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,900
my volleyball dreams haven't ended,

557
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,100
and they will never end.

558
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,800
I'm just continuing it from another approach.

559
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,200
Also...

560
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,300
Qiu Zi Xuan...

561
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,900
I even plan to do double majors.

562
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,100
I'll major in Information Science

563
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:26,100
and Sports Health.

564
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,600
An additional specialty is an additional share of power

565
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,200
to help the volleyball team do even better thing--

566
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,300
I know I crossed the boundary,

567
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,400
but this isn't a competition.

568
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,000
Qiu Zi Xuan...

569
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,200
I like you.

570
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,300
I was being serious earlier.

571
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,600
We have a competition tomorrow,

572
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:13,000
are you crazy telling me this right now?

573
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,400
I didn't do it on purpose.

574
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:17,900
I just...

575
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:20,600
I can't think about this right now.

576
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,100
Qiu Zi Xuan.

577
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,700
Stop calling my name.

578
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,300
But I...

579
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,500
Stop bothering me!

580
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:14,830
♫ Loneliness is always easily,  ♫

581
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:20,370
♫ Easily camouflaging into independence  ♫

00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:24,410
♫ Full of craziness, it’s gradually becoming expired  ♫

583
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:27,400
♫ Indulging the accumulation of feelings ♫

584
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:35,330
♫ Slowly, we start to get close ♫

585
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:38,770
♫ I’ve crossed over this boundary ♫

586
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:41,490
♫ No one taking precautions ♫

♫ No matter who advances and who retreats ♫

00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:52,740
♫ We are not different, just again and again we keep passing by ♫

♫ You crossed over this boundary ♫

591

♫ It’s not a violation ♫
