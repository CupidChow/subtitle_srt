[HIStory 2- Right or Wrong]

10
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,600
You dare lay your fingers on a high schooler?

11
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,000
Get out of here!

12
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,300
Do you want to do it with me?

13
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,800
Is this something you should say to a stranger?

14
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,800
Really.

15
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,400
I really don't know what young people are thinking nowadays.

16
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,400
Being rejected in a relationship.

17
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,800
Being bullied at school.

18
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,800
Being looked down on by teachers and peers.

19
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,800
So you resort to treating yourself like this?

20
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,100
I'm filthy.

21
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,700
Who said so?

22
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,600
The senior who rejected you?

23
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,300
The students who bullied you?

24
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,900
The teacher who thinks you're sick?

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,400
Or was it yourself?

26
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,600
Listen carefully,

27
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,900
you idiotic brat.

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
The reason you were rejected

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
was only because he didn't like you.

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,300
"Our personalities don't match."

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,200
or "Being friends is better than being lovers,"

32
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,500
are not reasons but excuses.

33
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,700
It just so happened it was someone of the same sex.

34
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,000
What do you know?

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,200
He was the first person I liked.

36
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,900
I liked him so much, so very much.

37
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,900
Plus, he was the one who said he liked me first.

38
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,100
It was he who confessed first.

39
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,700
Love is not all there is in life.

40
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,000
Forget it.

41
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,200
If you really can't get over it

42
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,200
and want to find some stranger

43
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,700
to save you from the pain of a broken heart,

44
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,500
be sure to take this.

45
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,500
But I'm nothing but a stranger to you anyway,

46
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,600
so whether you're dead or alive, it means nothing to me.

47
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,600
But if you have a home

48
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,500
and a family that worries about you,

49
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,100
think about how sad they will feel.

50
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,300
I'm pretty sure you have a family.

51
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,900
So, for them, try to learn to grow up.

52
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,500
Make yourself accept the fact that your relationship failed.

53
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,500
And save that

54
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,200
for someone who truly loves and cherishes you.

55
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,700
You're only 16.

56
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,500
You won't just have one relationship.

57
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,300
What you think is most important now

58
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,200
might not be that important in the future.

59
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
People change.

60
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,700
But I still feel brokenhearted.

61
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,100
Nothing has changed!

62
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,000
It still hurts.

63
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,400
What wrong did I do?

64
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,400
What did I ever do wrong?

65
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,300
Why am I this way?

66
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,400
Was it so wrong to like him?

67
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,900
Go on and cry.

68
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,800
Cry all you want.

69
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,200
After you're done crying, remind yourself

70
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,900
that in the future you'll find the real Mr. Right.

71
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,400
In the end, they have already expired

72
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,600
and I still haven't met the right one.

73
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,700
"To my dearest dad and mom.

74
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,400
I'm sorry I left this way.

75
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,600
I couldn't write the will required for Life and Death class,

76
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,400
so after writing and re-writing, I just decided to leave it like this."

77
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,800
Student.

78
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,400
Life isn't that fragile.

79
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,900
You better revive yourself and pay attention in class.

80
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,000
Rewrite it.

81
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,100
"Dad and mom. If I have any savings,

82
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,200
divide them into four.

83
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,300
One for you alone and one for you guys.

84
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,800
One for my older sister and the other one for my wife and kids."

85
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,800
Student, this isn't a will,

86
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,600
it's a property allocation.

87
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,600
They're totally different.

88
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,700
Rewrite it.

89
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,300
Now, this one is something special.

90
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,600
"To my dearest sister,

91
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,800
to be honest, I really don't like your boyfriend.

92
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,200
But then again, he's really handsome."

93
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,500
Rewrite it.

94
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,100
Students.

95
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,600
None of what you have written are real wills.

96
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,500
Go back and give it more thought.

97
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,000
I'll give you two weeks to submit a proper will.

98
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,000
Being able to write a touching will

99
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,400
means you're able to write a touching love letter.

100
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,600
For your own happy future

101
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,800
put in more effort.

102
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,100
But people use LINE and emails nowadays.

103
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,400
Would you accept someone if they confessed to you using these methods?

104
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,200
It does feel a bit insincere.

105
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,000
Yes.

106
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,800
By the way...

107
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,400
Haven't I told you guys

108
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,800
that this will makes up 60% of the entire course credit?

109
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,400
60%?

110
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,100
That's ridiculous.

111
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,500
He didn't say anything about that.

112
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,100
"Haven't I told you guys

113
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:36,300
that this will makes up for 60% of the entire course credit?"

114
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,300
We're not even dead.

115
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,900
Why should we write a dumb will?

116
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:39,600
Yes.

117
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,600
Shi Yi Jie's brain is definitely crazy.

118
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,700
Fei Sheng Zhe,

119
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,000
do me a favor.

120
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,800
Can I say no?

121
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,500
NT$170 for an hour.

122
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,700
NT$250.

123
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,700
NT$200.

124
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,100
Then you've got to go to Yo Yo's Sports Day event.

125
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,500
Deal.

126
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,000
Hello?

127
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,600
Yes.

128
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,500
The data for the human bones in the 13th Column?

129
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,500
Hold on.

130
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,400
Here.

131
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Hey.

132
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,400
1800 to 500? Hold on.

133
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,700
Hey.

134
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,000
Do you need help?

135
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,600
There a limit to how far your hands can reach.

136
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,700
No, I'm fine.

137
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,700
I can do it, okay?

138
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:18,800
Hey.

139
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,800
Hold on a minute.

140
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,400
Are you okay?

141
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,400
I'm fine.

142
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,100
That's good to hear.

143
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,400
Be careful.

144
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,700
Why are you still standing there?

145
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,100
I'll cut your pay if you slack off.

146
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,400
This one, too.

147
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,500
Okay.

148
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,100
Why are there only two bowls?

149
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,000
Where's Daddy's?

150
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,200
He's busy with work today. He won't be home for dinner.

151
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,100
But he promised me he'll come to your Sports Day event.

152
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,100
Really?

153
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,500
Is he really coming?

154
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,700
Yes. He promised.

155
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,000
Daddy!

156
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,300
Why are you home?

157
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,900
Didn't you say you weren't coming home to eat?

158
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,000
It's all your fault.

159
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,200
My fault?

160
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,300
I couldn't find anything good to eat

161
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,400
in the school's canteen.

162
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,400
My stomach is too used to your food.

163
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,400
I came back just to eat and will go back to school later.

164
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,000
Did anyone ever tell you, that you're a foodaholic?

165
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,400
I'd rather you call me a gourmand.

166
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,300
Yo Yo, help me get a bowl and chopsticks.

167
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,400
Okay.

168
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:28,200
Fei Sheng Zhe, you're really ready to be married off.

169
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:28,900
Nonsense.

170
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,500
No way. Brother Xiao Fei is going to marry me.

171
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,500
Fei Sheng Zhe, you have to go through me first if you want to marry my daughter.

172
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,900
Stop kidding around.

173
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,500
Come on. Let's eat.

174
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,400
Okay.

175
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:47,800
This is Daddy's.

176
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,100
Here.

177
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,500
Thanks.

178
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,200
This is Yo Yo's.

179
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,000
This is Brother Xiao Fei's.

180
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,100
Thanks, Yo Yo.

181
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,200
Do you want me to prepare a lunchbox

182
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,000
for you to take to school?

183
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,400
I don't have any intentions behind it so don't misunderstand.

184
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:15,700
I just want to repay--

185
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,800
You said it yourself.

186
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,700
No skimping on the quality.

187
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:21,800
You're so annoying.

188
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,700
Here, Yo Yo.

189
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,100
I also want a lunchbox you make to eat.

190
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:31,000
Yo Yo, doesn't your school already prepare a nutritious meal?

191
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,600
But I want the lunchbox you make to eat.

192
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,800
Okay, I'll prepare one for you.

193
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,700
Yes.

194
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,900
I want to eat poached eggs.

195
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,700
Poached eggs.

196
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,300
Thank you.

197
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:45,900
What's this?

198
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,500
It's Kung Pao chicken.

199
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,600
Kung Pao chicken.

200
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,200
Hey.

201
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,400
You're even making a lunchbox for him now?

202
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,200
I have to go over there to make breakfast anyway.

203
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,700
It's fine if I make something extra for lunch.

204
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,800
He pays me extra.

205
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,800
Why are you looking at me like that?

206
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,400
Do you know there's a love called,

207
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,100
"Delivering Lunchbox Love?"

208
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,600
Why don't you just capture the throne in his house

209
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,400
and become the family's matriarch?

210
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,300
What are you talking about?

211
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,800
I'm worried about you.

212
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,700
Hey.

213
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,500
You're so invested in Shi Yi Jie's household matters for no reason.

214
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,100
You've even become their caretaker;

215
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,800
a 24-hour nanny.

216
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,500
And now, you're even preparing their lunchboxes.

217
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,000
There's only one reason for doing all this.

218
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,700
You have fallen in love.

219
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,500
Love your face!

220
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,400
I only want to--

221
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,600
Want what?

222
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,400
If it's not love, is it gratitude?

223
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,700
Did I guess correctly?

224
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,400
Is he the savior you told me about before?

225
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,300
No wonder.

226
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,800
Now I know why you agreed so readily

227
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,800
when we took Yo Yo back

228
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,000
and he asked if you could help take care of her.

229
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,000
As expected from our Xiao Fei,

230
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,100
you even know how to repay kindness.

231
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,100
But does he remember you?

232
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,500
No.

233
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,300
Anyway,

234
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,400
don't worry.

235
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,600
I won't act so rashly again.

236
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,000
You said it yourself.

237
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,200
You really scared your mom and me the last time.

238
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,400
Especially your mom.

239
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,000
She was scared to death--

240
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,800
Hey!

241
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,600
Who was scared to death?

242
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,000
You almost scared me to death, Zhou Shao An.

243
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,300
Have you finished the script?

244
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,300
Can you come and do the shoot this week?

245
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,500
I finished the script a long time ago.

246
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,200
But...

247
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,900
my sister is suddenly coming back this week from overseas.

248
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:44,900
So, I probably have

249
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,100
to help clean her room.

250
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:46,800
Hey.

251
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,500
Do you really want to go after Xiao Fei or not?

252
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,100
The one I'm after is--

253
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,200
If you do, then that's good.

254
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,300
Show him your sincerity then.

255
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,600
Otherwise, I won't let you go.

256
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,500
No, I'm--

257
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,500
Hey... guys?

258
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,000
I'm going to deliver this lunchbox.

259
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,300
Bye.

260
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:01,800
Bye-bye.

261
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,600
Bye-bye.

262
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,100
Who's Xiao Fei delivering the lunchbox to?

263
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,400
Shi Yi Jie.

264
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,900
From a nanny to a lunch deliveryman.

265
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,600
I'm not sure if that's a promotion or demotion.

266
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,000
You said he's helping Shi Yi Jie to look after his daughter?

267
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,100
Yes.

268
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,400
Remember to be more proactive.

269
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,000
Okay, I will.

270
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,400
So, have you made up your mind?

271
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,700
Are you going to join us on the Mali archaeological team?

272
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,100
Isn't it still in the process of securing funds?

273
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,600
We can discuss it when it's confirmed.

274
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,900
If you don't reserve a spot now, it'll be too late when it's confirmed.

275
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,100
You need to know

276
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,900
that an archaeological team isn't like the Olympics, occurring once every four years.

277
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,200
It's like the Halley comet.

278
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,100
It only passes by Earth once every 76 years.

279
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:51,900
Your lunchbox is--

280
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,100
You even got your student to deliver a lunchbox?

281
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,100
Are you sure you won't be called out

282
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,500
for abuse of power?

283
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,600
He gets paid.

284
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,900
Can you make him a fresh cup of coffee?

285
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,200
- Okay.
- Thanks.

286
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,500
Hey, you have always been interested in the Sanghai Empire.

287
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,900
You already missed one opportunity when you had that shotgun marriage.

288
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,700
You know these opportunities don't come often and might not come again if passed up.

289
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,000
If you're worried about Yo Yo,

290
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,500
you can hire a professional nanny to look after her.

291
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,400
You told me that you have a good nanny now, right?

292
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,600
Just don't worry and leave the kid with him.

293
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,500
Give me a bit more time to consider.

294
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,400
Okay. Eat your lunch then.

295
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,600
I'll skip the coffee.

296
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,300
Student,

297
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,200
listen to my advice.

298
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,400
Men should have a goal as early as possible.

299
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,400
But don't rush into marriage.

300
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,100
Don't worry about not finding love.

301
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,800
Men are like ancient relics.

302
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,100
The older they get, the more valuable they are.

303
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,400
If you marry too soon,

304
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:00,300
you'll end up like my classmate, your teacher, here.

305
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,200
Jiang Zhao Peng.

306
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,400
What?

307
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,800
You're full of nonsense.

308
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,900
Make up your mind quickly.

309
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,200
Here.

310
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,600
Where's Yo Yo?

311
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,500
She's showering in your bathroom.

312
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,600
Does archaeology require long trips away?

313
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,900
It depends on luck.

314
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,700
One year... two, five or even longer.

315
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,100
A lifetime of digging pits?

316
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,000
Yes.

317
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,100
That's why we need funding and support.

318
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,100
It's hard to set up a team.

319
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,200
No wonder your classmate said that.

320
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,300
Will you go...

321
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,700
and leave Yo Yo here by herself?

322
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,800
Do you have something you want to do?

323
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,700
Of course.

324
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,400
I want to quickly graduate.

325
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,700
I want to complete my army draft quickly.

326
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,200
Find a job quickly to ease my mom's burden.

327
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,200
Then, I want to prepare for the CFA while I work.
(CFA - Chartered Financial Analyst exam)

328
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,200
I didn't think that although you're young,

329
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,400
your thinking would be quite mature.

330
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,200
People can change.

331
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,200
What you think is important now

332
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,900
might not be in the future.

333
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,300
So...

334
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,900
what you thought was important in the past,

335
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,000
might not be at this moment.

336
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,400
My father left when I was very young.

337
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,700
My mother is my only support.

338
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,900
I think it's the same for Yo Yo.

339
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,800
Since her mother has passed away,

340
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,900
she can only depend on you.

341
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,300
Hey, stop killing people off randomly.

342
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,600
Killing people?

343
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,100
Yo Yo's mom is not dead.

344
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,300
We're divorced.

345
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,200
Oh, divorced...

346
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,400
Brother Xiao Fei, I'm done showering.

347
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,900
Okay, I'll be right there.

348
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,900
I'm going to help Yo Yo dry her hair first.

349
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,200
Brother Xiao Fei, I need to start dieting tomorrow.

350
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,300
Why?

351
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,700
You're not fat.

352
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:57,600
Wu Yi Qian said I'll never defeat him at the Sports Day event.

353
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Just ignore him.

354
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,600
Boys always tease the people they like.

355
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,600
Can you braid my hair for tomorrow?

356
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,400
Braid? How do you want it to be?

357
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,400
Just like Elsa's hair.

358
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,200
Elsa?

359
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:11,900
Yes.

360
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,200
Her hair is white. Do you want white hair?

361
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,400
Put this down first.

362
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,600
Let me teach you.

363
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,700
Like this.

364
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:17,800
Okay, and then?

365
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,200
Lastly, you do this.

366
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,400
Okay, I get it now.

367
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,200
Is this okay?

368
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:22,600
Okay, that's enough.

369
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,300
Like this?

370
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,700
After it's done, you need a hair tie.

371
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,900
Where's the hair tie?

372
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,200
Take the hair tie and tie it up.

373
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,800
Cross it over and around.

374
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,800
That's so ugly.

375
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,500
Don't use this.

376
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,600
That's because it's pink.

377
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,300
It's prettier.

378
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,700
Okay, look.

379
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,700
That tickles.

380
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,600
By the way,

381
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,300
a few of you did quite well with the will.

382
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,100
As for the rest of you,

383
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,200
remember to submit your will next week.

384
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,000
Okay.

385
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,500
Class dismissed.

386
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,000
Mr. Shi smiled at me just now. He's so handsome.

387
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,300
I think so, too.

388
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,200
He's a little annoying

389
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,700
but he looks a bit of a badass when he smiles.

390
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,000
Just like a bad boy, you mean.

391
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,600
Yes, it's that kind of feeling.

392
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,600
Indeed. People often say

393
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,900
that women love bad boys.

394
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,400
Even though he's divorced,

395
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,900
a man needs to have a little dark history to be considered bad.

396
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,800
Yes, those dark histories make them more memorable.

397
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,800
Hey.

398
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,400
What do girls actually think about?

399
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,400
Are you sure you want to ask me?

400
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,300
Forget it. You wouldn't know anyway.

401
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,500
That's so rude.

402
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,200
Hey.

403
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,100
Do they know that what they're seeing is an illusion?

404
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,000
He really loves to sleep late.

405
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,700
Usually, I can't even wake him up.

406
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,700
After he's done with something, he doesn't put it back where it was.

407
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,200
Does he think those things have legs and can return by themselves?

408
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,500
Also, he throws his dirty clothes everywhere.

409
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,300
Especially his socks.

410
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,700
He even likes to read while he's bathing.

411
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,900
Does he think he's some prince?

412
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,200
And then there's Vanessa.

413
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,200
Who's Vanessa?

414
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,200
The skull.

415
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,200
Don't you remember?

416
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,500
The first time we went to his house

417
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,600
we saw that skull.

418
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,300
He named it Vanessa.

419
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:19,100
He kicks it like a rubber ball every day.

420
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,200
Or else he steps on it and uses it as a foot massager.

421
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,300
Yo Yo's learning to do it, too.

422
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,600
I have no idea why girls like him.

423
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,500
I don't know what they see in him.

424
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,100
But I think

425
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,400
you like a whole lot about him.

426
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,500
Me?

427
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,500
Like him?

428
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,700
Are you nuts?

429
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,200
I'm just repaying his kindness.

430
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,700
There is a sort of gratitude called, "giving yourself to him

431
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,000
and throwing yourself in his arms."

432
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,000
Hey.

433
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,800
Exchanging one thing for another.

434
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,000
Can you stop being a gossip?

435
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,400
It's a little disgusting.

436
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,400
Let your inner beast free.

437
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,800
Shh, keep your voice down.

438
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,200
Nobody is listening.

439
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,200
What? Is someone going to find out?

440
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,400
Such a gossip.

441
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,000
Embarrassed? So embarrassed.

442
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,200
Teacher, Professor Huang and Professor Ye are busy lately.

443
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,500
The meeting will probably be canceled.

444
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,700
Okay. Then, sort out the rest

445
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,200
and give it to me by Friday.

446
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,100
Yes, Professor.

447
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,800
Wildcat, you're here?

448
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,700
Who's the wildcat?

449
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,600
I heard that when wildcats transform

450
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,600
they will put a leaf on their head.

451
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,100
They jump in the air and somersault, too.

452
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,800
That's not funny.

453
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,200
I'm going to sort the files.

454
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,700
Did something happen?

455
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,800
No.

456
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,700
There's nothing.

457
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,400
I wanted to ask you something.

458
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,200
You could have just asked your assistant to tidy up the place.

459
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,500
You didn't need to pay me to do it.

460
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,800
That's because I like the way you tidy up a room.

461
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,300
Especially the way you sort out files and books.

462
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,000
I just wish for the organization at home and school to be the same.

463
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,100
This way it's easier for me to find things.

464
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,000
So you like my organizing?

465
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,400
Barely.

466
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,000
Hey.

467
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,800
What would happen if you just praised me occasionally?

468
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,000
Being funny and having a lacking mouth are two different things.

469
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,000
A lacking mouth?

470
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,000
Meaning you don't know how to talk to other people.

471
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,800
You must not have liked to talk when you were little.

472
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,700
Perhaps you were always locked in the bathroom and bullied.

473
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,000
In your teens,

474
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,200
you condemned the world and wanted to kill everyone in it.

475
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,500
Your best friend was a skeleton.

476
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,900
How did you know?

477
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,000
Did Sister Juan tell you?

478
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,300
But how did she know?

479
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:25,500
What?

480
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,200
I was just blabbering nonsense. What are you doing?

481
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,800
What's the matter?

482
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,100
Did the orphanage Dean say it?

483
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,800
Shi Yi Jie, what's going on?

484
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,800
Shi Yi Jie!

485
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,200
What's wrong?

486
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,300
Shi Yi Jie.

487
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,200
Don't be like this, okay?

488
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,300
I was just joking with you.

489
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,400
What's going on?

490
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,500
What's wrong, Shi Yi Jie?

491
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,700
Shi Yi Jie, look at me.

492
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,900
Shi Yi Jie.

493
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,700
Don't be like this, Shi Yi Jie.

494
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,800
Shi Yi Jie, don't be like this.

495
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,700
Shi Yi Jie!

496
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,500
You tricked me!

497
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,200
Hey, young man. Don't be so rash.

498
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,300
You've got pretty good reactions though.

499
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,500
Don't touch my head as if it's nothing.

500
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,100
I'm not a little kid.

501
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,000
Get back to tidying up.

502
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,200
You're back?

503
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,400
Yes.

504
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,200
Have you had dinner?

505
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,400
Should I make you some supper?

506
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,500
Sure.

507
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,600
Go on and wash up then.

508
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,800
You can eat when you're finished.

509
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:35,800
Let me explain.

510
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,000
Today's scene is similar to the last.

511
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,400
- But the context is completely opposite from last time.
- Opposite.

512
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,600
Let's try it once.

513
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,300
- Okay.
- Okay.

514
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,400
Right, action.

515
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,600
Xiao An...

516
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,800
Please stay.

517
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,700
For me.

518
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,200
I must go.

519
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,100
Xiao An!

520
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,300
Yes, that's very good.

521
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,400
That's the feeling we're going for.

522
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,700
We'll do the real thing in a bit.

523
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:01,900
- Okay.
- Okay.

524
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,600
Sheng Zhe, I think

525
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,800
that moment when she bumps into you,

526
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,200
your smile can be even cuter.

527
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,800
And then, we'll give you a close-up all the way.

528
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,000
- Okay?
- Okay. Yes.

529
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:09,800
Okay.

530
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,500
All right.

531
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,100
Is that it over there?

532
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:18,900
Yes.

533
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:19,800
Let's go. Let's go

534
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,700
Go find him.

535
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,600
Hurry.

536
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,800
Brother Xiao Fei!

537
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,000
Why are you two here?

538
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,500
Yo Yo said she wanted to see the Drama Club's project.

539
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,500
Yo Yo, have you finished your homework?

540
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:35,500
Daddy said I could only come if I finished it.

541
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,900
Wow, you're such a good girl.

542
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,900
Can I watch your acting later?

543
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:40,900
Of course.

544
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,300
What are you acting as?

545
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,600
I'm the Superman.

546
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,300
Teacher, I'm sorry.

547
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,500
I'm going to borrow Xiao Fei.

548
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,400
You guys can rest over there.

549
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,800
Don't just stand and not move around.

550
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,700
All right.

551
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,100
Here.

552
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,700
Let's change the angle.

553
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,600
You'll kiss from this side.

554
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,400
Okay. We'll go for the real thing now.

555
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,100
Do we really have to kiss?

556
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,100
I thought we're just staging the scene.

557
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,400
This way, it'll have a better effect.

558
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,700
But you're a girl.

559
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:15,000
I'm not complaining. Why are you?

560
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,200
But...

561
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,200
If you keep on blabbering,

562
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,400
I'm going to take the initiative to kiss you later.

563
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,400
All right. We're going to roll it now.

564
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,000
Okay.

565
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,300
Action!

566
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,100
Xiao An!

567
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,300
Xiao An!

568
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,100
Cut!

569
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,400
There's an underage girl here.

570
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,100
Thank you.

571
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:58,900
You've all worked hard today.

572
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,500
You've worked hard. You've worked hard.

573
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,400
This is for you.

574
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,100
Thanks. You're so cute.

575
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,400
Milk tea for you.

576
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,200
Thanks.

577
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,800
I thought you had gone home,

578
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,100
but you actually went to buy drinks.

579
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,700
I felt bad for interrupting your shoot just now.

580
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:24,800
This is compensation.

581
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,600
Actually, I was inwardly relieved.

582
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,800
Thankfully, we only had to stage the shot.

583
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,100
Brother Xiao Fei!

584
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:34,900
Wow, Yo Yo.

585
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:37,900
I'm treating you to a drink, but Daddy paid for it.

586
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,000
Thanks, Yo Yo. I'm so thirsty.

587
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,200
Let's go play on the swings.

588
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,400
Okay, let's go.

589
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,700
Let's fly high, okay?

590
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,700
Yes.

591
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,700
Start.

592
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,900
Is this high enough?

593
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:51,900
No.

594
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:52,800
Higher?

595
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,400
Okay.

596
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,000
Higher?

597
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,900
Brother Xiao Fei, you also have to sit over there.

598
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,600
Okay. Do you want to compete with me?

599
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,600
Yes.

600
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,800
Okay.

601
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,800
Ready? Start.

602
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,300
Brother Xiao Fei, you're swinging really low.

603
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,400
I'm higher than you, okay?

604
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,300
Hey, come here.

605
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,100
Tell your Daddy to come and play, too.

606
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,100
What are you two doing?

607
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,100
What? Are you badmouthing me?

608
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:22,800
What?

609
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,100
What?

610
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,400
Take a seat.

611
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,600
You're going to push me?

612
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,600
Yes.

613
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,900
Do you know how?

614
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,600
Can you do it?

615
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,000
Fei Sheng Zhe, you're so annoying.

616
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,800
We'll push your dad together. One, two.

617
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,000
Fei Sheng Zhe, you better be careful.

618
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:41,900
Three.

619
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:42,600
Fei Sheng Zhe.

620
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,400
Hey, Yo Yo.

621
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,000
So heavy.

622
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,200
Yo Yo, stop helping the outsider.

623
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,400
Three.

624
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,700
Your daddy is so heavy.

625
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,800
Are we done yet?

626
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,800
Not yet.

627
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,700
Fei Sheng Zhe, you be careful.

628
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,500
I'll fail you.

629
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,900
I feel so scared.

630
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,200
One, two, three.

631
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,900
They look like a happy, shining family.

632
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,100
They're shining so brightly.

633
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,400
Are we going to be seeing any BL?
(BL - Boy Love)

634
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,800
It looks promising. Huh?

635
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,500
Not bad. I think there's a chance.

636
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,900
One, two, three.

637
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,300
One, two, three.

638
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,700
One, two, three.

639
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,700
Fei Sheng Zhe, you be careful.

640
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:24,600
I'll fail you.

641
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,600
I feel so scared.

642
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,200
Go... Hurry.

643
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,000
That's so amazing. Who's next?

644
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:28,700
Hurry.

645
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,500
You must break the record from last time. Break the record from last time.

646
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,600
Faster.

647
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,100
Fei Sheng Zhe, you're so slow.

648
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,500
- It's so hard. Your turn.
- My turn.

649
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,700
Take this, hurry.

650
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,600
Did I do it wrong?

651
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:46,800
Ready?

652
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,300
Start.

653
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,900
So childish.

654
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,500
Daddy,

655
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,100
you keep running the wrong way.

656
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,800
We're definitely going to lose.

657
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,900
We won't.

658
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,100
We have Brother Xiao Fei.

659
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,200
Yes, I'm here.

660
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,900
We'll definitely be first place.

661
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,600
I didn't think you'd be pretty agile.

662
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,600
I thought a researcher wouldn't have good physical strength.

663
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,500
I'm 31, not 61.

664
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,500
31?

665
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,900
You're 12 years older than me.

666
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:08,100
So what? Are you discriminating against old uncles?

667
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,200
I wouldn't dare.

668
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,600
It's just that I thought you were at least 20 years older than me.

669
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,000
Fei Sheng Zhe.

670
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,000
I was just kidding.

671
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,100
You're not old at all.

672
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,500
You're a handsome uncle.

673
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,600
Right, Yo Yo?

674
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,200
That's right. Daddy is the most handsome.

675
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,900
Yo Yo, you have food all over your mouth.

676
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,000
You're the same way.

677
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:29,600
What's the matter?

678
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,700
Good luck! We support you.

679
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,000
Yes. Gender is not a problem.

680
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,500
We support multivariable family structures.

681
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,400
You guys are great.

682
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,700
I'm sorry.

683
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,000
I'm going home first.

684
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:05,000
Daddy, where is Brother Xiao Fei going?

685
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,300
Is Yo Yo asleep?

686
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:10,300
Yes. Kids are like that.

687
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,400
You know she's very worried about you.

688
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,200
- I want to quit.
- You like guys.

689
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I won't allow it.

690
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,400
What?

691
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,900
Are you complaining because there's too much work or the pay's too low?

692
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,400
Are you using this as an excuse to get rid of me?

693
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,000
Let me tell you.

694
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,900
Before you graduate, it's not going to happen.

695
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,400
But I like men.

696
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,600
So?

697
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,600
I'm not normal.

698
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,900
I'm filthy.

699
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,900
- I'll be a bad influence on Yo Yo.
- Who says so?

700
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,500
Somebody else or you yourself?

701
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,100
You are you.

702
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,200
You're Yo Yo's favorite big brother.

703
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,700
You're my most dependable student.

704
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,600
I don't know what you went through

705
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,600
that made you so unsure of yourself.

706
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,800
But when you're here,

707
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,600
you can be fully reassured.

708
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,700
What? You don't believe me?

709
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,700
I do.

710
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,500
It must be hard for you.

711
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,100
Do you want to do it with me?

712
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,600
Cry all you want.

713
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,200
After you do, remind yourself

714
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:55,300
that in the future you'll definitely find your Mr. Right.

715
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,200
Hello.

716
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,000
Hello, Ye Zi.

717
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,000
What's the matter?

718
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:15,400
I think I'm in love with Shi Yi Jie.

719
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:58,600
♫ The past where I'm thinking of you ♫

720
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:03,400
♫ Is still in your memories ♫

721
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:07,600
♫ No need to ask, I understand ♫

722
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,600
♫ What kind of excuse ♫

723
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:14,400
♫ Can be used ♫

724
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,800
♫ So I don't have to be in this intersection ♫

725
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,800
♫ Too many people talking about ♫

726
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:26,300
♫ Right or wrong ♫

727
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:30,800
♫ It has isolated our feelings ♫

728
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,800
♫ Again and again, the cowardly me ♫

729
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:39,000
♫ Wants to go back ♫

730
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,600
♫ Who can give me this courage ♫

731
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:46,400
♫ We never stop learning ♫

732
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,600
♫ Learning how to cherish ♫

733
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:55,500
♫ Never again letting anything make me regret when it's too late ♫

734
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:58,600
♫ Look at my eyes ♫

735
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:03,000
♫ Come close to my heart ♫

736
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,900
♫ Oh ♫
