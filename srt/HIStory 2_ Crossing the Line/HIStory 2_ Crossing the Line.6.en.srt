6
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,000
Maintain it at forehead level.

7
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,000
I didn't ask you to set the ball using your forehead.

8
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,700
Did it hit your eye?

9
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,400
Let me take a look.

10
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,800
It's fine.

11
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,900
Hey!

12
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,500
The ball has already fallen, where are you looking?

13
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,400
Sorry. I'm sorry.

14
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,500
Again! Again!

15
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,600
Give me a new one.

16
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,060
Be more focused.

17
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,000
Whose shirt is this?

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,100
It's yours; take it.

19
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,700
Fuck, what right does he have?

20
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,800
What's wrong with Senior Jia Jun?

21
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,700
Senior Zi Xuan is training Xia Yu Hao,

22
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,700
so he's jealous.

23
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,500
Jealous?

24
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:09,000
Xiao Ji Ji, I heard that.

25
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,400
Don't call me like the Captain does.

26
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,500
Hmph!

27
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,900
He doesn't even know how to set a ball.

28
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,400
What right does he have to join our team?

29
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,100
Last year, we were almost in the top four.

30
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,200
That's because the seniors were there.

31
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,200
It has nothing to do with us.

32
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,400
- Isn't that right?
- Yes.

33
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,400
But this year, a lot of the seniors are taking exams,

34
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,800
so only Captain and Da Ke are left.

35
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,000
We'll take the championship this year.

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,500
As long as Xia Yu Hao doesn't mess things up.

37
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,400
I have to find a way to kick him out.

38
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm leaving.

39
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:48,900
Okay. I'm leaving first.

40
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,300
Bye-bye.

41
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,700
It didn't pass.

42
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,800
Don't bend your arm.

43
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,000
This is just giving the ball to the opponent, not serving.

44
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,800
You're just giving them a free point.

45
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,300
Can't you teach me a cooler looking move?

46
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,000
Like...

47
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,400
What?

48
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,700
The one you did last time.

49
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,800
No.

50
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,300
Jump serves are not something for rookies to practice.

51
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,700
An underhand serve is very powerful.

52
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,400
As long as you have a good control of the ball, it's even more lethal.

53
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,800
Out.

54
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,800
I'm going to work now.

55
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,300
Be careful.

56
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,000
What's the matter?

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,600
Since I joined the team,

58
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,000
this is the first time you've cared about me.

59
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,700
Leave.

60
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,500
I'll see you tomorrow.

61
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,100
Hey, wait.

62
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,700
For you.

63
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,300
You're gifting me a ball that belongs to the school?

64
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,900
That's mine.

65
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,000
Practice well.

66
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,700
Thanks.

67
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,500
Why are you here?

68
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,100
I...

69
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,600
I forgot my phone.

70
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,200
Go get it. Don't you still need to get to work?

71
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,900
I'll help you get the balls.

72
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,200
It's fine. I can do it.

73
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,000
It's fine.

74
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:19,600
Okay.

75
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,800
I"m fine, I can do it.

76
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,400
Let's go.

77
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,700
Okay.

78
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,100
Aren't you going to be late?

79
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,200
I asked my boss for leave.

80
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,900
I see.

81
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,800
Your jump was very high just now.

82
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,600
Help me keep this a secret.

83
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,800
Okay.

84
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,400
Watch out.

85
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,600
Thanks.

86
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,000
How about I carry you?

87
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,400
Wait, wait a second.

88
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,900
Wait a second.

89
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,800
I-I'm too heavy.

90
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,500
You're not that heavy.

91
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,000
Thank you.

92
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,300
Hello, Boss.

93
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,400
Thank you for today.

94
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,900
Yes, yes, I will.

95
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,800
I will definitely find time to make up the shift.

96
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,000
Yes.

97
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,800
Okay.

98
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,300
Good night.

99
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,400
He's really an ace.

100
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,000
Hello?

101
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,100
It's me.

102
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,200
Why are you calling me so late?

103
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,600
You played so cool in the top eight quarterfinals.

104
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,800
You called just to say that?

105
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,100
Or are you worried about me?

106
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,200
No.

107
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,000
Dream on.

108
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,000
Hello?

109
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,500
You're still going to volleyball practice later?

110
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,600
Are you really going to be a rebellious youngster

111
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,700
now turned fierce volleyball player?

112
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It gets more interesting the more I play it.

113
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,100
Hey, give it back.

114
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,000
I'm going.

115
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,700
Good ball.

116
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,500
Good ball.

117
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,100
You did that on purpose.

118
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,600
Who are you to take Senior's ball?

119
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,400
Can you get it, short legs?

120
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,000
Fuck.

121
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,800
Jia Jun!

122
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,200
Senior.

123
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,400
It was him.

124
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,200
Not good.

125
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,500
You should be more subtle in the beginning, if you're trying to bully a rookie.

126
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,200
Like when--

127
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,700
He Cheng En.

128
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,700
What's the matter with you guys?

129
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,800
It's almost competition time

130
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,100
and you seniors are still busy with pranking and bullying rookies.

131
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,800
Do you still want to play on this team?

132
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,100
That's why I think it's unnecessary training a rookie.

133
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,400
Jia Jun.

134
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,200
Senior, I have something I want to say.

135
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,800
I think that there aren't many days left before the competition.

136
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,800
We really shouldn't waste time

137
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,100
training a rookie that doesn't know anything.

138
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,600
He's a waste of our time.

139
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,300
We're not trying to be like the team in Slam Dunk.
(Japanese Basketball manga)

140
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,800
What? I thought it was Haikyu.
 (Japanese Volleyball manga)

141
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,100
Hey, why are you dissing me?

142
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,000
Senior, quit arguing.

143
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,800
I joined the team to win,

144
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,700
not to argue and fool around.

145
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,300
Let me know when you're done arguing.

146
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,400
Jun Zhe, don't be like this.

147
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,700
Jun Zhe.

148
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,700
Hey, Xiao Ji Ji!

149
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,300
Did I say you could take a break?

150
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,300
Yes (you didn't), Captain.

151
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,200
But can you not call me by that name?

152
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,800
Wow, Xia Yu Hao.

153
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,800
I've known you for so long

154
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,500
but I have never seen you get bullied before.

155
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,700
It's so magical.

156
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,400
You guys--

157
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,300
Manager, Captain.

158
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,200
I want to join the team.

159
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,500
Join the team?

160
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,800
To protect you.

161
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,200
Welcome.

162
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,800
Zi Xuan, take him to the locker room to change into sports attire.

163
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,700
Wow, this tall already.

164
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,200
How about you? Do you want to join us, too?

165
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,200
You've got good qualifications.

166
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,000
Zi Xuan, take him, too.

167
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,400
Let's welcome them both.

168
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,400
Hey, you don't like sports,

169
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,600
so why did you join the team?

170
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,000
To support my brother.

171
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,400
Brother?

172
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,700
Wherever Yu Hao goes, then I follow.

173
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:14,000
I'm asking you seriously, don't fool around.

174
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,300
Okay, no more jokes.

175
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,300
It's because...

176
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,100
I'm feeling annoyed.

177
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,700
Annoyed about what?

178
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,200
You.

179
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:42,100
Wang Zhen Wen joined and his older brother also followed.

180
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,800
Is this what "buy one get two free" is?

181
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,700
Xuan.

182
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:50,100
Stop talking like He Cheng En.

183
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,800
I think Wang Zhen Wu has good physical strength.

184
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,200
Also, it seems like he's used to training.

185
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,600
He's totally different from his younger brother.

186
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,900
Of course.

187
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,900
We don't have the same parents.

188
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,300
Perhaps, it's...

189
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,800
what the legend says, brother CP (couple) from remarried parents?

190
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,800
What's "CP"?

191
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,100
Stop fooling around, Xiao Xiao.

192
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,800
Fine.

193
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,000
Senior, this is the training log you asked for.

194
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,700
It's recorded very well.

195
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,100
Have you done this before?

196
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,600
Really? Let me see it.

197
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,300
Really.

198
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:39,600
I can't believe you can do this.

199
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,900
I have decided.

200
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:45,200
The next manager in line will be you.

201
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,700
- Senior, that's a joke. Right?
-Take this.

202
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,700
I also think that's a good idea.

203
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,800
- Isn't that right?
- Yes.

204
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,000
Brother!

205
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,100
Hey, sister.

206
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,000
Why are you here?

207
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,300
I bought some delicious muffins for you.

208
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,600
Thanks.

209
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,100
Xia Yu Hao?

210
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,400
Why are you here?

211
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,400
You know him?

212
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,600
She's your sister?

213
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,600
Let's go home together later.

214
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,800
Senior wants me to organize some files.

215
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,800
Then, I'll wait for you.

216
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,000
She asked me out for dinner.

217
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,800
So, you like Xiao Xiao?

218
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,900
It's none of your business.

219
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,400
Today's not the first day you have known Zhong Zhong.

220
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,000
She's definitely a devil.

221
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,400
She's not human.

222
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,200
So you're Zhang Li Qin from An Nan?

223
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,500
Why did you change your name?

224
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,500
My mom remarried.

225
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,500
Then just change your last name.

226
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,100
Why did you change your entire name?

227
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,900
Am I right, Junior?

228
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,400
Who knows what he's thinking?

229
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,900
Hey.

230
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,200
You should have told us earlier that you were from An Nan.

231
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,100
They have quite a good volleyball team.

232
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,400
I see you trained yourself quite well.

233
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,300
But shouldn't you be in Year Three?

234
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,300
Why are you in Year Two?

235
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,100
Did you start school late?

236
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,800
Does he hate me?

237
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,300
Who?

238
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,300
My younger brother.

239
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,600
What?

240
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,200
I don't understand why he thinks I'm annoying.

241
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,800
He used to cling on to me all the time before.

242
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,600
Now, he even joined the volleyball team that he hates the most.

243
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,100
I think it's strange.

244
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,000
What's so strange about it?

245
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,500
Why don't you just go and ask him?

246
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,000
Ask him?

247
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,400
I haven't prepared myself mentally to ask him yet.

248
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,400
What if... I don't know.

249
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,500
He's your younger brother,

250
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,700
just ask him directly.

251
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,300
Hi.

252
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,200
What do you want?

253
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,500
Please help me pass this to Xia Yu Hao.

254
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,400
You just met him once and you're already making lunch boxes for him?

255
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,200
I have met him twice.

256
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,500
He's the person I told you about,

257
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,400
the one who saved me.

258
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,300
He saved you?

259
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,100
Xia Yu Hao?

260
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,600
Even so,

261
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,100
you can't just like him like this.

262
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,000
Hey.

263
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,300
It was love at first sight.

264
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:58,500
He's my one and only true love.

265
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,900
You said that when you met your last boyfriend, too.

266
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:05,700
But this time, it's real.

267
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,800
You also said that when you met the one before the last boyfriend.

268
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,600
Brother, please.

269
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,200
Help me out.

270
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,100
Help me give this to Xia Yu Hao.

271
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:22,400
I love you. Okay?

272
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,300
Fine.

273
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,400
Thank you.

274
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,200
You're the best.

275
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,200
I love you.

276
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,400
This is for you.

277
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,700
You...

278
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,500
You made me this lunch box?

279
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,100
Not me, my sister did.

280
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,200
I just found out this morning

281
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,500
that you got expelled for saving my sister.

282
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,400
I'm sorry for getting you--

283
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,500
I just wanted to fight.

284
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,100
There's no need to apologize.

285
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,600
I'm her brother, so it's my responsibility.

286
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,900
I'm sorry.

287
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,700
And thanks for saving my sister.

288
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,900
If you want to thank me,

289
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,800
teach me your...

290
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,600
Yay!

291
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,400
No way.

292
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,100
I knew it.

293
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,600
Take this back. I don't want it.

294
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,500
This is my sister's sincerity.

295
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:24,000
She said I must give it to you personally.

296
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,800
And watch you eat everything.

297
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,800
What are you doing?

298
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,300
My sister also said

299
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,400
that I must record how you look when you're eating her lunch box.

300
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,700
What?

301
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,500
Hurry up.

302
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,400
Stop delaying it.

303
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,700
Hurry and eat.

304
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,700
You--

305
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,100
Are you sure your sister wants to thank me

306
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,400
and not poison me?

307
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,600
It should be fine.

308
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,100
Zhen Wen,

309
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,400
from now on, you'll be in charge of logging the warm-up sessions.

310
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,000
That's really troublesome.

311
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,600
Then go train with them.

312
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,100
Why is this so easy?

313
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,100
It's so easy. Thanks, Senior.

314
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,700
Take this.

315
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,200
Zi Xuan, this is the log for today.

316
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,500
Do you want to...

317
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,000
Zi Xuan, what's wrong?

318
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,800
I'm fine.

319
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,400
I'm fine.

320
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,900
Hey, Senior...

321
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,600
Zi Xuan! Zi Xuan!

322
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,400
- Hold him, I'll go get the teacher.
- Hey!

323
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,200
Are you crazy?

324
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,600
You finished that kind of lunch box just to support your sister, that's too...

325
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,600
Disgusting.

326
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,500
Do you have a sister's complex?

327
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,800
My sister put a lot of effort into making it,

328
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,600
I didn't want to waste it.

329
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,700
So you used your life to cherish it?

330
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,200
Ending up like this, do you feel honorable?

331
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,000
Sister complex.

332
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,400
Mama's boy.

333
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,800
Sister complex.

334
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,600
Mama's boy.

335
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,100
Sister complex.

336
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,200
Mama's boy.

337
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,100
Hello, sister.

338
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,500
Why are you calling?

339
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,800
The lunch box?

340
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,700
Disgusting.

341
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,300
Yes, I gave it to him.

342
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:12,300
I didn't get the time to take the video.

343
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,300
Was it good?

344
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,500
The flavor he liked?

345
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,600
Okay. I'll tell you when I have the chance to ask him. All right?

346
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,800
All right, I'll see you at home.

347
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,500
Bye.

348
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,500
I'm not going to tell you what I like to eat.

349
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,900
Also,

350
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,300
I'll never like your sister.

351
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,300
Tell her to be calmer.

352
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,700
Being liked by my sister

353
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,200
is your honor.

354
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,300
On you, I can see the unfortunate consequences

355
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,300
of being liked by her.

356
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,700
Zi Xuan.

357
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,600
Oh, no!

358
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,700
Zi Xuan.

359
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,300
Oh, no!

360
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,800
So, did you help me ask him?

361
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,900
Did Xia Yu Hao like the lunch I made?

362
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,300
Also, what does he like to eat?

363
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,700
Come here.

364
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,300
Sit down.

365
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,600
So?

366
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,500
Let me ask you.

367
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,200
When you were making the lunch box,

368
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,700
did you taste what you cooked?

369
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,200
Of course not.

370
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,300
The lunch boxes that I make,

371
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,800
I don't need to try them to know that they're delicious.

372
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,300
So?

373
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,400
Or did Xia Yu Hao not like it?

374
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,600
I don't know.

375
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,200
You don't know?

376
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,700
That's okay. I'll cook for him every day.

377
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:08,000
One day, I'll finally know what he likes.

378
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,500
Younger Sister.

379
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,000
Xia Yu Hao is really busy.

380
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
He needs to study and work,

381
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,900
as well as train.

382
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,200
He really has no time to acknowledge you.

383
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,500
It's fine if I just acknowledge him.

384
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:28,000
I'm really attracted to his cool look.

385
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,300
I'm going to go back to my room and continue researching recipes.

386
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,000
What?

387
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,900
And you'll help me give the lunch box to him tomorrow again.

388
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,500
Bye-bye.

389
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,600
Younger Sister!

390
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,000
Younger Sister!

391
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,800
Are you ready?

392
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,500
These are definitely hugely poisonous.

393
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,700
Whoever eats this will suffer diarrhea for a week.

394
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,300
Her sincerity wins over everything.

395
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,600
If you don't want it, then forget it.

396
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,800
Hey, you're not going to eat this one too, are you?

397
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,700
This is a lunch box that my sister made.

398
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,700
You also need to have a limit to your sister complex, all right?

399
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,600
You can also throw it away.

400
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,500
My sister put so much effort into this.

401
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,600
I don't want to see her sad.

402
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,300
- Let's go.
- What?

403
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,400
Where are we going?

404
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,000
Don't ask.

405
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,800
Eat this.

406
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,400
You won't die after eating this.

407
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,700
My sister's cooking is not that bad.

408
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:09,600
That's right, you'll just get diarrhea.

409
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,300
This is good.

410
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,100
I can't believe you can cook.

411
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,500
Nonsense.

412
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,100
I have been cooking for my mom since elementary school.

413
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,100
I'm a small head of the family.

414
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,700
It must have been hard

415
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,300
since it was just you and your mom.

416
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,800
Let's not talk about this.

417
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,700
Tell your sister that

418
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,000
she and I are impossible.

419
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,400
Why?

420
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,800
We don't have...

421
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,300
This kind of feeling.

422
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,500
You want this kind of feeling?

423
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,800
Just that kind, like you were instantly hit,

424
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,900
making you unable to take your eyes off of the person.

425
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:48,700
That person is the only thing in your eyes,

426
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,600
just like...

427
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,800
There's someone you like?

428
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,100
Who is it? Tell me.

429
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:58,000
Anyway, I don't have those feelings for your sister.

430
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,900
I didn't know you were this girly.

431
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,100
You're the girly one.

432
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,900
Your entire family is girly.

433
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,500
You were a girl to begin with,

434
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,200
that's why this tastes so good.

435
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,600
Try this.

436
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,000
These two go so well together.

437
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,700
Of course.

438
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,400
Try it with this.

439
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,300
Hey, you added too much.

440
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,800
Is it?

441
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,200
Let me try it.

442
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,200
Special ranking chef.

443
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,400
Give me some pickled cabbage.

444
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,300
They really go so well together.

445
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,400
Add some seasoning.

446
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:06,700
Is it gone?

447
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,700
It's gone.

448
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:11,300
Don't you think they're a good match?

449
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,100
What do you mean?

450
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,100
This is good. This angle is nice.

451
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:18,400
Are they...

452
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,700
Senior Xiao Xiao.

453
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:20,300
Oh, I'm coming.

454
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,000
Wait a minute.

455
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,600
Hey, hurry up and tell me.

456
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,400
This is perfect.

457
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,300
Hey, how can you...

458
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,100
Alright, everyone!

459
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,200
Today, we've gathered everyone here

460
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,400
because we have a huge announcement to make.

461
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,900
Our Zi Xuan here

462
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,800
has toiled extremely hard in negotiating

463
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,600
and Director Zeng Zheng Fan has finally approved it,

464
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,100
so we will have a training event during the holidays!

465
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,600
- Yay!
- Yes!

466
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,400
But there's one condition.

467
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,700
Our extra-curricular activities must not affect our grades.

468
00:31:55,700 --> 00:32:00,300
If any one of us fails even one subject,

469
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,500
the event will be called off.

470
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,200
Just to inform you guys,

471
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,300
I have already arranged the training venue

472
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,700
and all the fees have been paid for.

473
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,600
The money is non-refundable.

474
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,300
So, if one of us causes our training to be canceled,

475
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:17,300
then he will have to pay for everything.

476
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,900
That's right! Even if you have to sell your kidneys, you still have to pay us back.

477
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,900
Did you all hear that?

478
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,400
I believe that to us, these are all small problems.

479
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,100
Am I right?

480
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,200
Yes!

481
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,400
Wrong!

482
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,600
This is a huge problem for one person.

483
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:38,000
What is the problem?

484
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Where's your kidney?

485
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,800
All your subjects don't even add up to 150 points?

486
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,200
How can you score just 39 points on the language exam?

487
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,100
Where did you find this?

488
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:02,200
The exams are in less than two weeks,

489
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,300
it's too late to start with the basics.

490
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,500
We can only use other methods now.

491
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,600
I don't want to cheat.

492
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,400
I meant memorizing all the formulas and types of questions.

493
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,000
It's a good thing our teachers don't give tricky questions,

494
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,300
so it shouldn't be hard to predict them.

495
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,600
Hey, where are you going?

496
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,100
I don't want to study.

497
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,900
We must go to the training event.

498
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,800
As your manager,

499
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,600
I'm ordering you to sit down.

500
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,500
Sit down. Very good.

501
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,600
We will start with math.

502
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,300
Every year, there are always questions on coordinates.

503
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,500
Let's start with this question.

504
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,300
There are three coordinates.

505
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,100
A (5, 0, 0)

506
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,600
B (0, 4, 0)

507
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,900
C (0, 0, 3)

508
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:44,600
So first, we must find out the relationship between the three coordinates.

509
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,400
Get a pencil.

510
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:52,000
Start with A minus B, using this formula.

511
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,400
Do you see this formula?

512
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,200
Look here. This is the formula.

513
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,800
This formula is very important,

514
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,000
so you must memorize it.

515
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,400
First, we do A minus B using this formula,

516
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,800
then you'll get this number.

517
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,700
The difference is X.

518
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,900
B minus C equals Y.

519
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,800
A minus C equals Z.

520
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,300
So, it is XYZ.

521
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,100
X, Y, Z.

522
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,400
Yes.

523
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,800
Then, use this formula.

524
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,000
From this second formula,

525
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,200
you'll get this number.

526
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,700
Hey, Junior.

527
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,400
Captain.

528
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,100
How is it? Can you handle the training list?

529
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,200
If you can't handle it, tell me quietly,

530
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,000
I'll help you get some free time.

531
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,200
I heard Zi Xuan say that he's giving you special tutoring for exams.

532
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,900
Not bad, huh!

533
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,000
Just hang in there for a while more.

534
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,400
There are a lot of things to memorize.

535
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,500
But his predictions for the exam questions have always been accurate.

536
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,400
And you would know.

537
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,700
Hey, of course, I would know.

538
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,500
Okay? I was in your spot before.

539
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:00,100
I was the first one who went under his special tutoring.

540
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,500
Besides, if it weren't for me,

541
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,800
he wouldn't be so accurate in his exam predictions.

542
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,700
Without me there wouldn't be him, right?

543
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:08,100
So you're the lucky one.

544
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,100
Not bad.

545
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,500
Your reflexes have really improved.

546
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,500
Zi Xuan taught me that.

547
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,000
Are you two really close?

548
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,200
Hmm.

549
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,500
We're friend-friends.
(T/N: He said a common idiom wrong.)

550
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,000
No, we're childhood friends.

551
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,800
No, that's also not it.

552
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,200
Anyway, our relationship is like this.

553
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,000
Inseparable!

554
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,200
We're almost...

555
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,000
Fortunately, Xiao Xiao was there. Otherwise--

556
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,600
Hey, where are you going?

557
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,900
Your Captain's still talking to you!

558
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,300
Whatever.

559
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,000
What do you mean "inseparable"?

560
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,100
Welcome.

561
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:01,000
Excuse me for disturbing you.

562
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,200
You like Bruce Lee?

563
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,400
What is this turtle doing?

564
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,300
Surfing.

565
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:15,400
Surfing? How cute!

566
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,300
What are you doing?

567
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,600
You're here, I'm just telling my mom that.

568
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,500
Wow. And you still say you're not a mama's boy?

569
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,700
You're so annoying.

570
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:31,700
Is the mama's boy angry?

571
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:32,900
Hey!

572
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:46,300
Are you okay?

573
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,800
Did I accidentally kick your injured leg?

574
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,000
Does it hurt a lot?

575
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,500
It's fine.

576
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,200
Let's start with the special tutoring.

577
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,000
Special tutoring.

578
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,700
Get your book.

579
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,500
Last time, we were looking at this question on page 141.

580
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:18,800
Average velocity means...

581
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,700
Does it hurt a lot? Should I get some ice?

582
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,900
No, it's fine.

583
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:24,800
This question.

584
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,700
Average velocity refers to the displacement of an object over time

585
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:33,200
and the formula is V=(X2-X1)/(T2-T1).

586
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,800
V refers to the average velocity.

587
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,000
X refers to the distance.

588
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,500
T refers to the time.

589
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,600
Memorize this formula.

590
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,300
Concentrate more.

591
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,900
Okay.

592
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,100
This one...

593
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:55,700
V is the average velocity.

594
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:01,700
This minus this will give you this number.

595
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:05,000
T refers to the time, okay?

596
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,400
Xuan.

597
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:14,100
Don't you think you're getting too close to him lately?

598
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,800
You are mine.

599
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,800
I am myself.

600
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,100
You can't look at other people.

601
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,700
You can only have me in your eyes.

602
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,800
Xia Yu Hao!

603
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:59,900
You're blocking me. Move.

604
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,200
This is...

605
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,900
What do you mean you're He Xiao Xiao's model?

606
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,900
You have to call her "Senior."

607
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:21,000
What kind of image has you and He Cheng En doing this and that?

608
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,700
Don't ask. You'll get scared.

609
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,700
So, why were you looking for me?

610
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,200
This is for you.

611
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,000
You're gifting this to me?

612
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,600
You want to bribe me?

613
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,600
I'm not going to go easy on you.

614
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,500
Who asked you to go easy?

615
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,500
You're really rude to your seniors.

616
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,200
Why do you care?

617
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,800
But this thing is really cool.

618
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,900
Do you like it?

619
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,300
Yes.

620
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,700
Don't you think it's really cute?

621
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,400
You can't look at other people.

622
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,600
You can only have me in your eyes.

623
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,300
What?

624
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,000
Th-There was a mosquito.

625
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,500
Where?

626
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:49,180
♫ Loneliness is always easily,  ♫

627
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:54,750
♫ Easily camouflaging into independence  ♫

628
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:58,830
♫ Full of craziness, it’s gradually becoming expired  ♫

629
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:01,750
♫ Indulging the accumulation of feelings ♫

630
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:09,690
♫ Slowly, we start to get close ♫

631
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:13,120
♫ I’ve crossed over this boundary ♫

632
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,850
♫ No one taking precautions ♫

633
00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:21,210
♫ No matter who advances and who retreats ♫

634
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:27,100
♫ We are not different, just again and again we keep passing by ♫

635
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:31,420
♫ The few moments that might have intersected ♫

636
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:34,900
♫ You crossed over this boundary ♫

637
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:37,630
♫ It’s not a violation ♫

638
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:43,090
♫ There won’t be any blame ♫

639
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:45,820
♫ Because love’s limit ♫

640
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:48,790
♫ Has already gone beyond understanding ♫

641
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:52,230
♫ Just let us go forward ♫

642
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:58,500
♫ Once I’ve crossed over, I won’t retreat ♫
