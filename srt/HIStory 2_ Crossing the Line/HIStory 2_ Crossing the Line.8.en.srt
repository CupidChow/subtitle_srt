6
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,200
Fighting, today.

7
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,000
- Okay.
- Here, just put it here.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,600
Everyone, put your things down.

9
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,800
Everyone, get in your positions!

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Jing Yang, you're serving first.

11
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,400
Hey, He Cheng En.

12
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,100
- Hey!
- Hi, twins.

13
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,300
It has been a long time.

14
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,800
You still haven't split up yet?

15
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,900
Trust me. You'll do better if you each fly solo.

16
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:10,900
Fuck. What trash are you saying?

17
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,400
If you and Qiu Zi Xuan are still together,

18
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,400
how could we split up?

19
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,200
How could we split up either?

20
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,700
We're inseparable like glue.

21
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,400
Hey, Qiu Zi Xuan.

22
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,900
Don't you need to warm up?

23
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,300
Why didn't you change along with them?

24
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,400
Is your injury still not healed?

25
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,500
That's none of your business.

26
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,400
Everyone, come here and warm up.

27
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,900
Do you guys not need to warm up?

28
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,200
Playing against you guys, do we need to warm up?

29
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,000
Wow.

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Your trash-talking skills are still sharp.

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,200
But please, don't warm up.

32
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,700
We'll drill you guys into the ground later.

33
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,300
No problem.

34
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,700
Be careful. Be careful.

35
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,400
Hurry and warm up.

36
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,660
Don't be nervous.

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,900
Jing Yang, you're serving first.

38
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,700
Don't be nervous.

39
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,100
Jia Jun.

40
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,100
Yes, Senior.

41
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,400
You'll be the spiker in the first round.

42
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,000
Okay.

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,400
I'll make sure to kill them all!

44
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,400
- Good luck! Be fierce!
- All right.

45
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,000
I was being serious earlier.

46
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
We have a competition tomorrow,

47
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,600
are you crazy for telling me this right now?

48
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,100
I didn't do it on purpose.

49
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:18,700
I just...

50
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,700
I can't think about this right now.

51
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,300
Qiu Zi Xuan.

52
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,000
Stop calling my name.

53
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,600
But I...

54
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,000
Stop bothering me!

55
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,600
Xia Yu Hao!

56
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,100
Warm up!

57
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,200
Why are you spacing out?

58
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,000
Zhen Wen!

59
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,200
Go carry two boxes of water over to Ren He.

60
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,800
Hurry.

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,600
Xia Yu Hao.

62
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,900
What are you looking at?

63
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,800
What? Don't look.

64
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,200
I thought you were watching a video.

65
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,800
I wasn't scolding you.

66
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,200
So,

67
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,900
your girlfriend's name is Li Qi?

68
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,500
You're so anxious about this,

69
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,100
it's probably because you really like her.

70
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,200
Relax.

71
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,600
We're good brothers.

72
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,400
I won't try to take her from you.

73
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,000
That's not what I meant.

74
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,100
I know.

75
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,600
Do you understand the rules now?

76
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,800
You don't?

77
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,500
Put on your shoes and go get your clothes,

78
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,400
we're going to the court.

79
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,000
Move faster.

80
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,000
Hey! No way.

81
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,900
You're still training?

82
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,000
He Cheng En, shut up.

83
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,600
All right, everyone!

84
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,100
Turn in early.

85
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,500
Good luck, tomorrow.

86
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,500

87

Zhen Wu.

88
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,400
Wang Zhen Wu.

89
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,000
I like you.

90
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,000
Not the "like" toward an older brother.

91
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,400
It's the "like" where I'm jealous of your girlfriend.

92
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,200
But you will never know

93
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,500
because I will never say this again.

94
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,800
I'm sorry.

95
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:52,400
I'm unable to think of you as my older brother.

96
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,700
I'm sorry

97
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,400
for waiting until now to give you back your favorite sport, volleyball.

98
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,300
I'm going to look for Jia Jun.

99
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,400
Jia Jun!

100
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,800
Yes, Senior.

101
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,100
Remember, you're Zhi Hong's spiker today.

102
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,000
Yes, I know that.

103
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,600
I'll do my best.

104
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,000
Do you know what "spiker" means?

105
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
What does it mean?

106
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,800
Heads.

107
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,300
We'll be serving first.

Please.

109
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,800
Play well, keep up.

110
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,100
Okay.

111
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,700
Just play relaxed and easy.

112
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,500
Okay?

113
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,000
They're nothing much.

114
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,600
The most important thing is don't get hurt.

115
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,400
Okay?

116
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,400

Did you hear that?

121
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,900
Concentrate

122
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,500
and stay steady.

123
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,800

Everyone, listen up.

177
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,600
Pay attention!

178
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,600
If you win the game today,

179
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,600
I'll treat everyone to steak.

180
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,100
Eat until you are full!

181
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,700
We can eat as much as we want!

182
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,400
Thanks, Coach!

183
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,500
Fighting!

184
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,300
It looks like the twins are up next.

185
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,800
They were baiting us just now.

186
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,000
Play well.

187
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Go on.

188
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,900
Play well!

189
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,400
Ren He's steel defense isn't that good.

190
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,400
We're winning so easily.

191
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,500
Hey!

192
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,900
What?

193
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,300
Watch out for your head.

194
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,400
Try saying that again.

195
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,100
Jia Jun!

196
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,300
Stop!

197
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,500
I'm switching players!

198
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,500
Coach, I can still do this.

199
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,100
Chen Jia Jun, Number 7

200
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,100
being replaced by Xia Yu Hao, Number 13.

201
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,300
Whether you switch players or not, it's all the same.

202
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,400
Just hurry up. Hurry!

203
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,800
Me?

204
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,600
Remember.

205
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,200
Just do as I taught you.

206
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,300
Do you hear me?

207
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,500
That's the first thing you have said to me today.

208
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,900
Focus on playing.

209
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,700
If I gain a point,

210
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,700
then think about what I told you yesterday.

211
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,500
Hey, twins!

212
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,400
- We're so excited.
- We're so excited.

213
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,300
I'm also very excited.

214
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,100
But you don't have Qiu Zi Xuan by your side.

215
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,100
Hey, Zi Xuan.

216
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,900
Hey!

217
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,500
Hey, you two.

218
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,700
Why are you calling him?

219
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,200
Mind your own business.

220
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,500
What?

221
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,600
Hey, Cheng En.

222
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,000
Why are the players on your team all so short?

223
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Stop spewing nonsense!

224
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,700
Do you want to play or not?

225
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,600
Bring it.

226
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,600
Hey, old friends.

227
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,000
Such easy play.

228
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,800
Everyone, stay steady!

229
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,700
Fighting!

230
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,200
All right, let's do this.

231
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,300
Be steady! Be steady!

232
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,200
Good ball! Good ball!

233
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,100
Hey, Zi Xuan.

234
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,600
His stance is the same as yours.

235
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,100
That looks so familiar.

236
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,600
Number 13.

237
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,300
What an interesting guy.

238
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,400
He must have been trained by Qiu Zi Xuan.

239
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,600
This guy, his luck's too good.

240
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,200
You there!

241
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,500
Send another one across if you dare.

242
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,500
Focus!

243
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,500
Got it.

244
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,100
Remember the rhythm.

245
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,800
Got it.

246
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,500
Got it.

247
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,900
Time! Stop the game.

248
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,400
Xia Yu Hao.

249
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,300
He injured his hand.

250
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,400
Coach, switch players.

251
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,700
Okay. Zi Xuan, look after him.

252
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,600
Switch players!

253
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:02,300
Chen Jia Jun, Number 7 replacing Xia Yu Hao, Number 13!

254
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,700
Sit down.

255
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,800
Ouch!

256
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,300
You actually used this dangerous method to save the ball,

257
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,600
are you crazy?

258
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,200
I want to win.

259
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,800
What are you talking about?

260
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,300
I really wanted to score a point,

261
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,100
so that you would consider what you promised me.

262
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,100
But when I stepped on the court,

263
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,300
I guess I finally understood what you meant by

264
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,000
the feeling of not wanting to leave

265
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,600
once you go on court.

266
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,300
You're starting to understand the charm of volleyball.

267
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,600
Probably.

268
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,800
Qiu Zi Xuan.

269
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,000
What?

270
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,200
If I train more diligently,

271
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,900
there's a chance to take you to the finals

272
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,400
and win the championship, right?

273
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,800
Why are you walking back?

274
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,900
Yesterday, I...

275
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,200
Why?

276
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,200
Zhen Wu, how come you didn't reply to me?

277
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,200
Why are you here?

278
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,700
I was waiting for you guys.

279
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,800
You must be Li Qi.

280
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,200
You know me?

281
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,300
Your brother must have told you about me.

282
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:02,900
Oh...

283
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,500
I guess he did.

284
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,000
So, did you get my gift?

285
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,000
Gift?

286
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,100
I'll be waiting for your reply.

287
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,500
I'll see you at school tomorrow.

288
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,200
Thanks.

289
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,800
What gift?

290
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:29,800
Hey!

291
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,400
What's going on here?

292
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,300
So?

293
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,000
What is it that you wanted to tell me?

294
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,100
The person she likes is you!

295
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,600
Please pass this to Wang Zhen Wen.

296
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,400
Zhen Wen?

297
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,600
My phone number is inside.

298
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,000
If he thinks I'm not bad,

299
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,400
please ask him to call me.

300
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,200
Any time is fine.

301
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,100
The person she likes is me?

302
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:21,900
Yes!

303
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,400
Then, what did I see all this time?

304
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,200
Nothing.

305
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,800
When I mistook her for your girlfriend,

306
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,500
why didn't you say something?

307
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,800
When I accidentally looked at your phone,

308
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,900
why did you get mad?

309
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,000
Do I have to say it?

310
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,400
How should I know what you're thinking if you don't tell me?

311
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,400
I didn't want you to know that someone liked you.

312
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,100
Why not?

313
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,600
I don't know.

314
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,200
Do you know this is really too mean?

315
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:54,600
Me?

316
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,500
I'm too mean?

317
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,600
Forget it. Pretend I didn't say anything.

318
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,500
I'm going home.

319
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,400
Give me some time to think clearly!

320
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,700
What do you need to think clearly about?

321
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,500
You and me. This thing between us.

322
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,900
What is there between us?

323
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,300
I heard everything you said last night!

324
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,300
What do you mean, you heard everything?

325
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,800
Everything.

326
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,200
Please give me some more time, all right?

327
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,400
So this is it.

328
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,600
Has everyone looked clearly?

329
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,400
No, Zhong Zhong.

330
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,700
If we eat this menu, then we'll all be superhumans.

331
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:26,000
Isn't that really good?

332
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,200
Or do you want to lose again?

333
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,500
Of course not.

334
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,000
You don't?

335
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,500
If you don't, then start moving right now!

336
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,500
Okay!

337
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,200
Gather at the volleyball court!

338
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,200
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

339
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,800
Xia Yu Hao,

340
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,200
why are you not following the others?

341
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,500
I'm looking for Zi Xuan to give me special training.

342
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,600
That's not necessary.

343
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,900
Zi Xuan says your standard qualifies you for regular training.

344
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,100
So you don't need special training anymore.

345
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,100
Hurry and get changed.

346
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,800
I have decided to add Wang Zhen Wu to the first round list.

347
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,300
I think so, too.

348
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,400
His foundation is not bad,

349
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,400
he just needs to work better with the other teammates.

350
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,200
You're right.

351
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,000
On our team, he's a pretty standard player.

352
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
When he first joined with his brother,

353
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I was hoping to make his brother a libero.

354
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,100
I didn't think it would be him.

355
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,300
What about Xia Yu Hao?

356
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:19,900
What?

357
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,500
His performance in the competition

358
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,500
really amazed the twins from Ren He High School.

359
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,800
They keep pestering me for an introduction but I blocked them out.

360
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,800
Although his foundation isn't stable,

361
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,800
he's much steadier than Jia Jun and much stronger, too.

362
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,400
He could be our secret weapon for upsetting the opponent's rhythm.

363
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,100
Besides, we can use him to replace Jia Jun,

364
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,400
when Jia Jun gets angry.

365
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,700
So that Jia Jun can have some time to cool off.

366
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,500
What do you think?

367
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:40,700
What?

368
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,600
I was talking to you, buddy.

369
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,600
What were you saying?

370
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,300
Fuck, you want me to repeat myself?

371
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,400
Speaking of the devil.

372
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,400
Xia Yu Hao.

373
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,000
I...

374
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,500
I need to get back to class.

375
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,300
We're not done discussing it.

376
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,200
Your classroom isn't even that way.

377
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,600
You two fought?

378
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,600
Can someone tell me what's going on?

379
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,700
Huh?

380
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,300
No problem, I'll just walk alone.

381
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,900
I'll just walk alone.

382
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,800
Do you want some?

383
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,400
Is it tasty?

384
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,100
Yes.

385
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,800
This one?

386
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,300
Don't be picky about your food.

387
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,600
I'll eat later.

388
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,500
Okay.

389
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,200
Thanks.

390
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,500
Hey.

391
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,300
You two made up?

392
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,500
Have you solved your problems?

393
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,300
He knows now, but we haven't solved anything.

394
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,800
But we've decided to let time solve it.

395
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,800
What does that mean?

396
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,500
While we were avoiding one another,

397
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,700
neither one of us was happy.

398
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,500
So... we agreed

399
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,400
to do what we like

400
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,100
and what makes us happy.

401
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,800
Everything else, we'll leave up to time.

402
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,000
So you're still avoiding things.

403
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,600
We're all still facing stuff,

404
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,700
but some things really do need time.

405
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,700
Isn't that right?

406
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,700
It seems like you're the one avoiding something.

407
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,700
How long has it been since you and Qiu Zi Xuan last spoke?

408
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,000
You're leaving?

409
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:28,400
Or else what?

410
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,600
I'm almost going blind now.

411
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,500
Why is he like this?

412
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,600
Why is he going blind?

413
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,400
I don't know either.

414
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:06,900
Brother.

415
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,900
Brother!

416
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,600
What?

417
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,600
Do me a favor.

418
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,400
What?

419
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,700
Tomorrow, I'm using this to win at last.

420
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,600
To win at last?

421
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,300
I'm going to confess to Xia Yu Hao.

422
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,500
You're going to confess to Xia Yu Hao?

423
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,300
Yes.

424
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,300
Times in the past, I've listened to you.

425
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:28,200
I left him alone during the exams and the training period.

426
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,900
But the more I think about it, the weirder it gets.

427
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:32,000
Being straight-forward is more my style.

428
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,900
But he likes someone else.

429
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,300
Really?

430
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,100
Who is it?

431
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,300
Is it someone I know?

432
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,100
I'm not sure.

433
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,600
Sister,

434
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,300
do you really like him?

435
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,600
Of course, I do.

436
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,700
What do you like about him?

437
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,500
He helped me get rid of those boys

438
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,600
who disturbed me at school.

439
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,100
It was so manly.

440
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,500
When he was called to the discipline room to be scolded,

441
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,500
the way he rebutted the teacher was also really manly.

442
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,800
Most importantly, he has such a handsome face.

443
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,400
He's just plain handsome.

444
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,600
Anything else?

445
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,800
What else is there?

446
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,800
Do you know that he has a bad temper?

447
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,000
That he's reckless and likes to sleep a lot?

448
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,500
He's a good cook and he's loyal.

449
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:21,800
When he's being serious, he puts in more effort than anyone else.

450
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,100
Wow.

451
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,800
How do you know him so well?

452
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,100
Perhaps, because I asked you to pass him my lunch boxes,

453
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,600
you became good friends with him?

454
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,300
Yes!

455
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,300
After school tomorrow, I'll come find you.

456
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,400
Go with me to help me confess to him.

457
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,200
You want me to go with you?

458
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,600
Yes.

459
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,100
No. He really does have someone that he likes.

460
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,300
Someone younger than me? Prettier than me?

461
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,400
Better than me?

462
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,000
Then, that's all right!

463
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,900
What is there to be afraid of?

464
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,300
I don't care!

465
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,100
You're coming with me tomorrow to go find Xia Yu Hao.

466
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,700
Otherwise, I'll tell mom and dad

467
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,100
that you're still on the volleyball team.

468
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,100
No, you can't!

469
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,900
You told them you're staying after school for extra studying,

470
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,000
but you're actually still practicing volleyball.

471
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
You really can't.

472
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,400
So, are you going with me?

473
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,500
Go with me.

474
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,200
I can't.

475
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,900
I don't care, go with me.

476
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,200
You're going with me tomorrow.

477
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,400
We've agreed, then!

478
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,200
What should I do? I'm so nervous.

479
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,300
Xia Yu Hao...

480
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,900
Be my boyfriend.

481
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,100
My brother told me that you have someone you like.

482
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,600
But I'm confident that I'm better than her.

483
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,800
Please choose me.

484
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,500
Do you like volleyball?

485
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,800
I like it, but my brother likes it more.

486
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,200
He's a total volleyball fanatic.

487
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,500
Will you help me with my homework?

488
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,600
And write English vocabulary flashcards for me?

489
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,500
No.

490
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,000
But I can learn to.

491
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,200
Can you become 180 centimeters tall

492
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,300
and weigh 65 kilograms?

493
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,800
Someone who wears black framed glasses

494
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,400
and loves to take care of others?

495
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,500
Someone who looks cold on the outside,

496
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,400
but actually is full of warmth on the inside?

497
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,500
Can you love volleyball to the point where

498
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:35,600
you're willing to be the team manager even when you can't play anymore?

499
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,600
Can you become the Qiu Zi Xuan

500
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,500
who keeps working hard and never gives up on his dreams?

501
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,700
Qiu Zi Xuan.

502
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,500
I'm an idiot.

503
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,000
I actually thought that

504
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,900
when you came to find me, it meant that I still had a chance.

505
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,100
If you can become him,

506
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,300
then I'll date you.

507
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,000
I can't believe I lost to my own brother.

508
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:58,900
Qian Ru.

509
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,900
Why didn't you tell me earlier,

510
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,700
that the person Xia Yu Hao likes is you?

511
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:09,000
I didn't know how to explain it to you.

512
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,500
If you had told me earlier,

513
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,400
I wouldn't have bought this box of chocolates.

514
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,800
I'll forget the fact that it was expensive.

515
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,300
Now I even have to finish them by myself.

516
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,200
I'll eat them and then be fat.

517
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,800
And when I'm fat, I'll have to lose the weight by myself.

518
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,000
Qian Ru, please don't cry.

519
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,200
Who's crying?

520
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,200
It's just that I got dumped

521
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,700
but it's not the end of the world.

522
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,400
But you said that

523
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,800
he's your one true love.

524
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,800
When I met my last boyfriend,

525
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,200
I said the same thing.

526
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,700
But you insisted that this time, it was real.

527
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:56,200
I said that too when I met my last last boyfriend.

528
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,700
Qiu Qian Ru,

529
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,900
do you actually like Xia Yu Hao or not?

530
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,100
I do.

531
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,700
I thought he would accept me,

532
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,700
so that when I go out with friends on the weekends,

533
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,500
I won't be looked down on by them.

534
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,500
Sister,

535
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,700
has anyone told you

536
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,700
that you're a real player?

537
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,800
How is this like that?

538
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,500
I'm only trying to get a boyfriend, not a husband.

539
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:47,000
I have heard of taking exams together, sleeping together, and eating together,

540
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
but I have never heard of going with someone while they confess their feelings

541
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,300
and you had to be there on the scene.

542
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,100
I think your sister complex is really at a terminal stage.

543
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,400
If I were Xia Yu Hao,

544
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,400
I'd have beaten you to death.

545
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,200
I know!

546
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,000
Even I felt like beating myself to death.

547
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,300
Do you know, that day, he looked very mad

548
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,800
but also very sad?

549
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,700
I should be the one who's feeling sad.

550
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:13,800
So you have been having an affair behind my back for all this time.

551
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,200
He Cheng En.

552
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,900
I was just joking.

553
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,800
Hey, brother.

554
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,800
Don't deny it.

555
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,900
The fact that you're hesitating means that Xia Yu Hao still has a chance.

556
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,800
So, what should I do?

557
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,700
What kind of expression is that?

558
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:43,400
Remember Jing Yang's cousin who's a lawyer?

559
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,800
Last semester,

560
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,800
he even brought his handsome engineer boyfriend

561
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,000
to watch Jing Yang's training.

562
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,800
Nowadays, these things really aren't peculiar anymore.

563
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,800
You...

564
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,700
get yourself together.

565
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,900
How about this?

566
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,400
Accept him?

567
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,600
Or reject him?

568
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,000
Choose wisely.

569
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
After all, Xia Yu Hao is being serious this time.

570
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,700
Hey, you're going to reject him?

571
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,100
No. Exactly which one do you want to do?

572
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,900
You took both of them?

573
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,500
Yes!

574
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:55,700
You're actually not a bad person, so why pretend?

575
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,000
Who said that?

576
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,100
Did I ever say that I was a bad person?

577
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:02,000
Would bad people admit they're bad?

578
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,800
Since I joined the team,

579
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,100
this is the first time you're showing concern for me.

580
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,200
Leave.

581
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,000
I'll see you tomorrow.

582
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Is the mama's boy angry?

583
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:17,800
Hey!

584
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,200
I'll carry you.

585
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,700
W-Wait a moment.

586
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,200
Wait a moment.

587
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,600
I'm very heavy.

588
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,200
You're not that heavy.

589
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:41,100
Just that kind, like you were instantly hit,

590
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,100
making you unable to take your eyes off of the person.

591
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:43,900
That person is the only thing in your eyes,

592
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,000
just like--

593
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,300
There's someone you like?

594
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,600
Who is it? Tell me.

595
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:53,200
Anyway, I don't have those kind of feelings for your sister.

596
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,400
An additional specialty is an additional share of power

597
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,300
to help the volleyball team do even better thing--

598
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,800
I know I crossed the boundary.

599
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,800
I know I crossed the boundary

600
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,200
Qiu Zi Xuan...

601
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,300
I like you.

602
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:50,700
Hey.

603
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,400
What's the matter?

604
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,400
Hello, Captain.

605
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,700
Where is he going?

606
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,200
Excuse me!

607
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,800
Xia Yu Hao?

608
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,400
Are you having leg cramps again?

609
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,400
About that day...

610
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,400
I didn't bring my sister to see you on purpose.

611
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,500
I know.

612
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,300
Your sister explained it to me.

613
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:23,700
Even if she hadn't, I also know that you aren't able to say no to her.

614
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,600
Since you've got a sister's complex.

615
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,800
It's just that...

616
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,600
Just what?

617
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:33,900
I was really sad that day.

618
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:36,200
I would rather you rejected me

619
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:39,800
than purposely push someone else at me.

620
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,600
I can't accept just anyone.

621
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,600
I'm sorry.

622
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,500
It's okay.

623
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,100
It's all in the past now.

624
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:29,900
Take this.

625
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,800
This is your favorite Calpico drink.

626
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,000
Xia Yu Hao.

627
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,600
I'm in Year Three.

628
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,300
I have to prepare for my entrance exams.

629
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:13,500
I also have to help He Cheng En train the volleyball team; I'm very busy.

630
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,800
I know.

631
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:25,100
I love volleyball. I'm a volleyball fanatic.

632
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,700
I know that, too.

633
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,600
I'm a senior.

634
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:37,800
I'll graduate before you and leave school.

635
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,600
What exactly are you trying to tell me?

636
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:49,400
What I wanted to say is...

637
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:52,000
Even if it's like that,

638
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,300
are you willing to always come and help massage me?

639
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,800
I'll be there whenever you call me.

640
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,300
Even if I have to skip classes.

641
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,100
No skipping classes.

642
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:13,900
I'll endure the pain until your school day ends.

643
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:16,700
So...

644
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,800
You're accepting me?

645
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,700
You're rejecting me?

646
