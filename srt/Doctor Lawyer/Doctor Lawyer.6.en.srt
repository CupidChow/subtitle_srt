1
00:00:00,792 --> 00:00:04,879
THE NAMES OF PEOPLE, INCIDENTS, AND
BACKGROUNDS OF THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:00:05,463 --> 00:00:06,840
The doctor changed.

3
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:09,718
I remember clearly.

4
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:12,012
I saw it and heard it myself.

5
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:16,891
The doctor…
The doctor changed during the surgery.

6
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:19,519
I think we need the head surgeon here.

7
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:22,439
I told you.
The VIP is here, so he can't come.

8
00:00:28,486 --> 00:00:29,696
This is too dangerous.

9
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:32,365
The tumor is in an odd location,
so if we cut it here,

10
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:33,700
we might hurt her nerves.

11
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:35,577
Director Gu Hyunseong left her with us.
So you won't do a thing?

12
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:37,454
Will you take responsibility?

13
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:45,128
Assistant Director, is the patient awake?

14
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:49,883
That was shocking. Her tape came off.

15
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,845
<i>I was frightened.</i>

16
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:56,973
I hoped it was just a nightmare.

17
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:02,896
Does Banseok University Medical Center
know that she remembers

18
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:04,272
the ghost surgery?

19
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:05,273
No.

20
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,025
They won't even hear us out.

21
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,527
We went a few times to complain,

22
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:11,821
but they wouldn't even let us in.

23
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,323
That's why we came to see you.

24
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:15,909
What a relief.

25
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:18,369
Sorry?

26
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:20,246
We can win this case.

27
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:28,379
Soyeon, from today until your trial,

28
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:32,467
you won't remember that
the doctor changed during the surgery.

29
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:38,723
<i>No!</i>

30
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:42,102
I saw and heard everything!

31
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:43,061
Plaintiff.

32
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:45,688
The surgeon in charge wasn't there,

33
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:49,317
and a different surgeon did my surgery!

34
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,614
Plaintiff. Calm down.

35
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,951
If you cause any more disturbance,
you will be removed.

36
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,133
Then it must've been a ghost.

37
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:24,102
A ghost? What kind of nonsense?

38
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:26,146
The victim saw it,

39
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:28,439
but no other surgeon did the surgery?

40
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:31,442
Then the only answer
is that it was a ghost.

41
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:34,237
An operation room ghost
that doctors at Banseok

42
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:36,364
can't see.

43
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:37,615
This is false information.

44
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,075
Please stop speaking.

45
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,285
Sustained.

46
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:43,413
Counsel for the plaintiff.
Please stop and take a seat.

47
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,582
I will prove to everyone here

48
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:50,295
that the operation room ghost does exist.

49
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:52,672
What are you talking about?

50
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:50,730
Tell me.

51
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:52,941
Do you still not see him?

52
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:55,360
I see him clearly.

53
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,783
Let me introduce

54
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:06,120
the Banseok University Medical Center
ghost who did Ms. Gil's surgery.

55
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:39,237
Why are you here?

56
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,823
In this world,

57
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,659
proper doctors
still outnumber those who aren't.

58
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:49,122
Of course, an attorney who only defends
despicable ones wouldn't know.

59
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:01,426
YIHAN

60
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:12,103
Yihan.

61
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:14,814
How did you find…

62
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:18,818
I came to have a talk
with the junior I adore.

63
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,784
EPISODE 6

64
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:28,786
This is…

65
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:32,623
Yes, it's a hospital. It's not much yet,

66
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,208
but it's cardiothoracic surgery.

67
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,002
Cardiothoracic surgery?

68
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:40,631
Even university hospitals have a hard time
keeping one. How can you do it here?

69
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,717
Thankfully, I got
all the medical equipment.

70
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:46,971
All I have to do now is
find trustworthy staff,

71
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,223
someone like you, Yosub.

72
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:59,650
You operated on Gil Soyeon, didn't you?

73
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:04,697
How did you know that?

74
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:06,699
The victim remembers.

75
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:09,410
She remembers that Gu Hyunseong left
during the surgery,

76
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:12,163
and another doctor came
and performed ghost surgery.

77
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:18,086
The only one who can be a ghost surgeon
for Gu Hyunseong is

78
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:19,754
just you.

79
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,967
As you know, Lee Dohyung and Cho Junghyun

80
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,595
won't spill the truth.

81
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:31,349
We need your testimony

82
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:34,018
to resolve the injustice Ms. Gil faced.

83
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,943
And what if

84
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,154
I can't be a doctor anymore?

85
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:49,492
I spent 20 years.

86
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:53,329
I studied hard since middle school
to get into a med school.

87
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,415
Then I did my internship,
residency, and fellowship.

88
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:58,459
I held out for 20 years
without taking a moment off.

89
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:03,548
So if this mistake stops my career…

90
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,513
I know how you feel.

91
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,306
Just like you,

92
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,685
I was Gu Hyunseong's ghost.

93
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:22,358
It must feel unfair and frightening

94
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,778
to have your license suspended

95
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,406
and get kicked out of Banseok.

96
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,200
It might feel like a death sentence.

97
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,245
I felt the same way.

98
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:37,623
However,

99
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:42,336
this may be one mistake for us,

100
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,256
but to our patients, that mistake

101
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,841
lingers forever.

102
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:50,636
We operate on numerous patients,

103
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,138
but to them,

104
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,724
we are their only surgeon.

105
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,523
You told me

106
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:05,651
that you hope I continue
to be a cardiothoracic surgeon

107
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,069
even if it isn't at Banseok.

108
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,406
I hope the same for you.

109
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,493
Even if it isn't at Banseok,
I hope you continue to remain

110
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,786
as a doctor.

111
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:32,970
WITNESS

112
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,972
Let me testify.

113
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,060
I'm the ghost doctor
who performed surgery on Ms. Gil

114
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:42,647
instead of the Head
of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Gu Hyunseong.

115
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:50,029
Are you admitting to your violation
of the Medical Service Act?

116
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:01,332
You're right.

117
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:05,002
I violated the Medical Service Act.

118
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:07,797
But I was threatened in the process.

119
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,299
-Your Honor.
-Stay quiet.

120
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:14,262
Threatened? Who threatened you?

121
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:18,516
A man who's sitting here in the audience.

122
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,936
Assistant Director Lee Dohyung.

123
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:27,024
-By the assistant director?
-He was threatened?

124
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,401
What is going on?

125
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:35,658
-Sorry?
-What are you looking at? Get to it.

126
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,828
But I can't operate on her
without telling her guardians.

127
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:41,872
Then will they be happy
if she leaves with her body part cut open?

128
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,585
It was either you
or Director Gu Hyunseong anyway.

129
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:48,879
We're already short of staff,
so we have to make do with everything.

130
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,131
Just get started.

131
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:02,143
I couldn't turn it down.

132
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:05,855
I knew it was wrong,
but the surgery wasn't hard.

133
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,149
I thought I just had to perform it well.

134
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:09,650
But…

135
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:20,036
But…

136
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:25,249
the location of the tumor was unexpected.

137
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,130
<i>This is too dangerous.</i>

138
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:34,216
The tumor is in an odd location,
so if we cut it here,

139
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,676
we might hurt her nerves.

140
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,553
Director Gu Hyunseong left her with us.
So you won't do a thing?

141
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,430
Will you take responsibility?

142
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:47,480
Assistant Director, is the patient awake?

143
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,693
That was shocking. Her tape came off.

144
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:57,823
What do we do? What if she heard us talk?

145
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,744
She'll think it must've been a dream.

146
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,704
But still…

147
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:04,830
All right.

148
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:09,126
We have no choice now.
You'll have to do this successfully.

149
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:10,795
Then everything will be fine.

150
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:18,594
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

151
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,972
I went into the OR
before checking her CT scan.

152
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:25,434
I saw the danger
once I checked the location of her tumor.

153
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:30,147
Yet I did not stop.

154
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:34,068
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

155
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,490
Witness, did you write yourself down

156
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,742
as the surgeon in charge
on the surgery record?

157
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,496
No, I couldn't.

158
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:47,998
Why couldn't you?

159
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:50,126
The head of the Banseok Legal Team,

160
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:54,672
Attorney Pyo Eunsil over there
gave me an order to stay silent

161
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:56,757
on the change of surgeons.

162
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,384
This is slander.

163
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:02,304
The witness is slandering me
with his one-sided account.

164
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:13,065
According to Article 22, Clause 3
of the Medical Service Act,

165
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,526
when medical records are
different from facts,

166
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:22,658
those who are affiliated
must be imprisoned for up to three years.

167
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,162
That's all for my questions.

168
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:34,253
Defense counsel,
do you wish to question him?

169
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:36,297
No.

170
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:44,346
The accounts of the witnesses
completely disagree.

171
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:48,142
This means
at least one side gave a false witness.

172
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,561
This may be a civil case, but perjury is

173
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,647
punished in the same way
as a criminal case.

174
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:56,525
The witness accounts all align

175
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,944
for the staff of the OR
other than Choi Yosub's account.

176
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:03,783
So isn't it obvious to see
which side committed perjury?

177
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:06,535
And the account of Choi Yosub,
the sole different one,

178
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,246
aligns perfectly
with the victim's statement.

179
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:12,416
In that case, we have
all the reasons to suspect which side is

180
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,877
trying to cover up the truth.

181
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,303
DEFENDANT

182
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,472
We must come to an agreement.

183
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,724
We'll take a break for 30 minutes.

184
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,853
DEFENDANT

185
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:01,257
Man, what will they do?

186
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:07,805
Both of you have done very well.

187
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,891
Do you think we can win?

188
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:13,185
It's a 50-50 chance.

189
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:15,563
Banseok is also prepared well,

190
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:16,689
and above all,

191
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,900
the witness accounts completely disagree.

192
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,376
I'm sorry.

193
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:41,714
No matter what happens,
I will gladly be punished.

194
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,592
If you tell me to quit being a doctor,

195
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,303
I will do that.

196
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:48,971
I mean it.

197
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,515
I am very sorry.

198
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:58,772
Why are you the only one
who's apologizing?

199
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:01,984
The ones who did worse

200
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,154
are making up lies and acting shamelessly.

201
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:09,450
Only you took my side today.
Why are you this sorry?

202
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:12,119
Why do you apologize?
Why are you bowing your head?

203
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:15,247
I'm sorry.

204
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:18,876
I'm… I'm so sorry.

205
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:21,879
I'm sorry.

206
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:29,178
I'm sorry.

207
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:32,264
I'm so sorry.

208
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:37,645
I'm sorry.

209
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,620
Man, that idiot.

210
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,957
I told him to keep quiet,
but he just took himself down.

211
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,210
Why are cardiac surgeons always like this?

212
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,045
Our hospital is a mess.

213
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,465
You don't think we'll lose. Do you?

214
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,760
Don't worry. It's not like
they have hard evidence.

215
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:12,471
The court won't accept ghost surgery.

216
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:16,183
What about awareness during anesthesia?
Are you saying they'll accept that?

217
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,645
I put her to sleep
and witnessed that there wasn't a problem.

218
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,855
What now? Do I get punished?

219
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:23,899
You just said it yourself.

220
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,235
In Korea, awareness under anesthesia
has never been considered

221
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,028
medical malpractice.

222
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:32,116
No need to worry
and keep your faces straight.

223
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:35,119
Let's walk in like winners, not losers.

224
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:39,665
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

225
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,041
<i>I will announce the sentence.</i>

226
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:45,963
In reflection on the account
of Choi Yosub, the witness,

227
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:50,467
it's evident that
the plaintiff remembers the conversation

228
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:52,886
only those who were

229
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,472
in the operating room could know.

230
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:59,101
Therefore, the medical malpractice

231
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:02,312
committed against the plaintiff

232
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:06,900
such as awareness during anesthesia
should be acknowledged.

233
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,946
However, there isn't
enough evidence to discern

234
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:15,159
if the medical records were fabricated
and if the surgeon was switched,

235
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,036
just as the plaintiff presented.

236
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:20,497
However, the plaintiff suffered
from medical malpractice

237
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:25,252
during the mediastinal tumor resection
and awareness during anesthesia.

238
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:30,883
The defendant must pay
for restoring thyroid cartilage, recovery,

239
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:34,720
and compensation for her mental distress.

240
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:41,226
Sentence.
The defendant must pay the plaintiff

241
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:43,604
a total amount of 100 million won.

242
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:09,213
Isn't this enough for us to say
I won by decision?

243
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:13,008
Lady, don't you know
what winning by decision means?

244
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:16,053
You were destroyed by us.
Stop making excuses.

245
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:19,306
You can feel that way
since our malpractice was acknowledged.

246
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,351
But that's not the case for him.

247
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,354
You probably worked hard
to get your hands on the witness.

248
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,689
All such trouble for nothing.

249
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,191
I'm not sure.

250
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,237
I don't think the match is over.

251
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:37,616
You don't think so?
What brings you here, Prosecutor Geum?

252
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:39,910
I came to watch.

253
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,746
As you know,
I am greatly interested in Banseok.

254
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:46,959
And since I came around to watch,
I was thinking…

255
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:50,963
of indicting this case.

256
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,677
My dear junior, you must be oblivious
due to your lack of experience.

257
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:59,888
Even if he's found guilty
of switching the surgeon,

258
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,015
he only gets fined
up to three million won.

259
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,017
It's not even a fine. Just a penalty.

260
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,729
Your hard work
won't even put a scratch on Banseok.

261
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,649
I didn't say I'll indict him
over switching the surgeon.

262
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:14,278
He'll be indicted for attempted murder.

263
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:17,948
What? Attempted murder?

264
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:24,413
He opened up his patient's body
with a scalpel and left the OR.

265
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:26,915
Doesn't that mean he left her to die?

266
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,376
Then it's attempted murder.

267
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,128
You psycho.

268
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:33,463
Do you think that'll work?

269
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:35,841
Why are you so worked up?

270
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:40,679
You can admit it and receive a favor
just like Park Kitae's case.

271
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,222
Right.

272
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,683
I bet you can't do that this time.

273
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:48,729
Because this is
Director Gu Hyunseong of Banseok?

274
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,148
Don't be so cheeky.

275
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,401
You barged in to arrest an innocent man
with a false report

276
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:56,236
only to get humiliated.

277
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,863
Don't be embarrassed again.

278
00:19:58,614 --> 00:19:59,489
Don't worry.

279
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,450
I'll also indict him
for violating the Medical Service Act

280
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:04,161
and professional negligence
resulting in injury.

281
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:08,624
Those are enough for imprisonment
and revocation of his license.

282
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,924
Yes, the trial is over.

283
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:19,927
<i>Mr. Han works like one of us.</i>

284
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:24,014
He quietly turned a witness for their side
and turned the tables at once.

285
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:27,809
I knew I chose the right man.

286
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:31,271
Also, Prosecutor Geum Seokyeong was here.

287
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:32,898
<i>They're leaving together.</i>

288
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:36,485
-Should I follow them?
-<i>No, just come back.</i>

289
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,612
They haven't spent time alone
in a long time.

290
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:40,322
You shouldn't interrupt them.

291
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:47,996
You've watched Banseok R and D Center's

292
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,290
activities and achievements up to now.

293
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:53,710
Now, Ms. Lim Yuna, the new director
of Banseok R and D Center,

294
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:57,172
who will be in charge going forward,
will give a speech.

295
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:58,840
Please give a round of applause.

296
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,320
Thank you for welcoming me.

297
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:23,073
I'm the new director
of Banseok R and D Center,

298
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:26,326
Lim Yuna.

299
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:27,869
First, I'd like to thank

300
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:31,415
and express my respect for
Chairman Gu Jingi for developing Banseok

301
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:35,502
to be the best medical foundation
in Korea over the past 20 years.

302
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:42,217
We're living in a new era.

303
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:45,721
Now anyone can extend their lives,
maintain their health,

304
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:49,641
and improve their quality of life
by using medical devices.

305
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:53,312
But I'll not be satisfied with that.

306
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:58,066
Going forward, as the center director,
I'll recruit outstanding talents

307
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,320
and make the R and D Center
an incubator to lead

308
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:05,240
future medical technology
through proactive exchanges

309
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,451
with both domestic
and global institutions.

310
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:23,842
It's quite good.

311
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,388
-Can you go say hello?
-Sure.

312
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:34,061
Hello. I couldn't make
a proper introduction earlier.

313
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:35,228
She is a CEO
of a biopharmaceutical company.

314
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:40,233
Congratulations. I was worried hearing
that the new center director is so young.

315
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,361
What a passionate inauguration speech.

316
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:44,404
At BioValley in Boston,

317
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:46,656
startups founded by young CEOs
are already recognized

318
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,159
as unicorn companies
worth trillions of wons.

319
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:53,080
If we don't want to fall behind them,
we'll need more young talent.

320
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,498
Yes, of course.

321
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:57,626
I'm very much looking forward
to your accomplishments going forward.

322
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,002
I'll be rooting for you.

323
00:22:59,086 --> 00:22:59,920
Thank you.

324
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:01,088
-Thank you.
-Sure.

325
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:03,882
Let's go that way.

326
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:07,511
Now, the only thing

327
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:11,014
that's really left is
for us to become one family.

328
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:14,226
Well, there is no reason to rush, right?

329
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:17,270
It hasn't even been a month yet
since she got back to Korea.

330
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:21,024
She is our precious daughter.
Hope you understand.

331
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:23,652
Yes, of course. I completely understand.

332
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:26,905
He's my precious one and only son as well.

333
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,492
-Hello.
-Hello, how are you?

334
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,994
Pardon me, Chairman Gu.

335
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,205
Oh, did everything finalize well?

336
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:36,540
Yes. No, actually…

337
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:41,336
I need to speak to you separately
regarding that.

338
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:46,383
<i>Attempted murder?</i>

339
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:50,137
What do you mean, attempted murder?
How did such nonsense come about?

340
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,638
I'm sorry, sir.

341
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:55,434
I've never imagined Prosecutor Geum would
side with a guy who killed her brother.

342
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:58,353
That's why you shouldn't have let it go
all the way to trial!

343
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:01,773
How could you allow one of our doctors
to take the witness stand?

344
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:05,318
You said it wouldn't matter if the victim
testified since she was delusional.

345
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:07,571
But nothing got taken care of properly!

346
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:10,615
I'm sorry, sir. I'll correct
the situation at all costs--

347
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:11,867
Ms. Pyo!

348
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:14,744
Get out. I can't stand the sight of you.

349
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:16,496
Get out!

350
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:22,085
Han Yihan.

351
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:25,755
You're causing me trouble in the end.

352
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:51,656
This way.

353
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:59,206

359
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:03,019
I have people who are helping me.

SEOKJU, VIP'S HEART

361
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:14,739
CHEON HYUNGU, BAEK KANGHO

362
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:17,701
PROSECUTOR-IN-CHARGE OF SEOKJU'S CASE

363
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:20,203
Kangho?

364
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:26,293
When I was held in custody
for Seokju's trial,

365
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:29,921
Gu Jingi hired a convict to assault me

366
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:33,008
and threatened to kill my mother

367
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:36,177
unless I admit to
breaching the Medical Service Act.

368
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,848
-What?
-If I hadn't admitted that way in court,

369
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:42,225
I doubt
I would've come out of there alive.

370
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:45,854
Baek Kangho,
the prosecutor who charged me,

371
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:48,356
is working with Gu Jingi.

372
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:03,580
It's 300 million won in cash.
We found it in your room.

373
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:06,625
Your medical license will be revoked
for pocketing the bribe.

374
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:10,128
If you feel even the slightest remorse
for Seokju's death,

375
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:12,130
admit the medical malpractice charge
and ask for forgiveness.

376
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:13,882
You're not even asking

377
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,593
why my face is all beaten up.

378
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:19,888
Why are you doing this?

379
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,515
You're not even listening to me.

380
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:27,145
Why are trying to blame me

381
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,815
for Seokju's death?

382
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:36,404
Look, Mr. Han Yihan.

383
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:37,822
Do I look like a lawyer to you?

384
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:40,533
I'm here to reveal your crime.

385
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:42,494
Other than the fact
that you're a criminal,

386
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:44,621
it has nothing to do with me
if you get hurt,

387
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:46,915
broken, or killed.

388
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:48,917
Got that?

389
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:00,804
No way.

390
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:07,060
Kangho would never do that. I know so.

391
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,356
If someone who would never do
such a thing actually did so,

392
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,108
there must be another reason.

393
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:16,861
But why?

394
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:20,657
I don't understand it
no matter how hard I think about it.

395
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:24,494
Why would Gu Jingi
go out of his way to put a blame on you

396
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:28,206
and kill Seokju to take away his heart?

397
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:33,670
Answer me.

398
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:36,548
You promised to be honest
and tell me everything.

399
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:39,092
Why? Why in the world did he do that?

400
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:43,138
Explain so that
I can understand and believe it!

401
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:56,735
I said in court there is a ghost doctor at
Banseok University Medical Center, right?

402
00:28:58,319 --> 00:28:59,571
Five years ago,

403
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:01,906
that was me.

404
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:06,619
-What?
-For many years,

405
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,748
I performed surgeries
on numerous patients as a substitute.

406
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:13,710
In order for Gu Hyunseong to become
the next director of the hospital,

407
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:17,380
he needed performance records
of operating on VIP patients.

408
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,133
And as a part of the compensation,

409
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:25,889
I got to operate on Seokju at Banseokwon.

410
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:41,154
The night that I performed
the heart transplant on Seokju,

411
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:46,951
a VIP with a concealed identity
was rushed over to Banseokwon.

412
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:53,166
The patient's heart was already removed,
so a transplant was needed immediately…

413
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:58,838
and Gu Jingi brought a heart.

414
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:09,015
Then, that heart was…

415
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:15,730
You're right. I was deceived by Gu Jingi…

416
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:22,320
and transplanted
Seokju's heart on the VIP patient.

417
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:32,664
How could he…

418
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:35,917
How could he do that…

419
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,628
as a human being?

420
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:46,803
You're lying, right?

421
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,930
How could a doctor…

422
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:53,142
I mean, a human being…

423
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:57,272
A human being shouldn't do such a thing.

424
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:59,732
It just doesn't make sense!

425
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:03,570
I am sorry.

426
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:06,531
Had I known…

427
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,325
Had I stopped the surgery,

428
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,080
Seokju and my mom…

429
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:18,501
would still be by our sides.

430
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:21,504
I am sorry.

431
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:25,925
I am sorry.

432
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:17,310
Why are you looking at me like that?

433
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:19,854
You are wearing the earrings.

434
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:22,357
I promised to wear them
for the inauguration.

435
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:24,233
And the other side?

436
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,195
The other one?

437
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:30,823
-What do you mean?
-The other earring.

438
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:32,367
Are you wearing it?

439
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:36,412
Of course. Who wears one earring?

440
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:39,290
Then show me the other one.

441
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:44,003
Can't you do it?

442
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:02,021
Why are you being scary?

443
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:06,442
I am sorry. I am so sorry.

444
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:09,237
I behaved strangely, right?

445
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:11,948
Yes. Very strangely.

446
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:15,159
But I will forgive you
since today is a good day.

447
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:19,122
You should cool off.
I will change my hairstyle

448
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:20,623
so that both earrings show.

449
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:23,376
Okay. Thank you.

450
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:36,139
That punk. How dare he toy with me?

451
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:45,732
Thank you.

452
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:48,067
Thank you.

453
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,444
Why didn't you tell me?

454
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:35,573
When you got out of the detention center
five years ago,

455
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:39,160
you should have told me the truth.

456
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:43,164
You wouldn't have believed me then.

457
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:47,126
Besides, I couldn't give an excuse.

458
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:50,171
It's true that Seokju died

459
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:53,174
because of my wrong decision.

460
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:56,052
I don't ask for forgiveness.

461
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:59,847
I will also pay my dues
once everything is done.

462
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:18,991
Welcome.

463
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,262
I am sorry
that I wasn't at the inauguration.

464
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:43,349
I didn't want
to make the situation messier.

465
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:46,811
How did Gu Hyunseong react?

466
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:48,980
You were right.

467
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:51,232
He asked to see the other one,

468
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,402
so I let him do that.

469
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:01,701
A prosecutor was here.

470
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:04,412
A prosecutor? What do you mean?

471
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:07,874
Gu Hyunseong was here with a prosecutor.

472
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:10,793
I think he figured out
that we were together.

473
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:12,545
How…

474
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:15,756
Don't worry.

475
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:19,760
If you do as I say, nothing will happen.

476
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:22,930
Actually, he will come to trust you more.

477
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:25,224
How did you prepare it?

478
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:29,437
Neither one of us knew
that Hyunseong would show up.

479
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:31,689
How did you prepare the earrings?

480
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:33,441
I didn't prepare them.

481
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:35,902
Things simply worked out.

482
00:37:06,098 --> 00:37:07,225
My goodness.

483
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:11,020
I thought hard about
which presents would be meaningful to you,

484
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:12,563
the woman who has all.

485
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:15,608
I never imagined such a thing.

486
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:20,529
I bought the same earrings
as the ones Gu Hyunseong gave you.

487
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:24,367
I didn't want
to see you wearing a present from him

488
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:27,245
when you were with me.

489
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:39,048
You always exceed my expectations

490
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:42,385
and amaze me.

491
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:06,075
Don't take action
no matter how he provokes you.

492
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:08,369
I understand.

493
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:18,045
Only the two of you can go in.

494
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:21,215
Okay. Wait at the door.

495
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:22,883
Yes, sir.

496
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:56,584
-What are you doing?
-Hold on.

497
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,086
We will be done soon.

498
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:23,986
Michael started the Queen's Gambit.

499
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:27,281
It's daring and sharp.

500
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:30,242
It's the gambit
that is best suited for the king.

501
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:32,244
However…

502
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:50,304
When the gamble fails,
you must pay the price.

503
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:57,436
How should we pay the price?

504
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:08,197
Restore Han Yihan's medical license.

505
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:13,327
If you decline, Honours Hand will sue.

506
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:15,788
The terms of the stock return
we agreed upon

507
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:18,290
will be called off as well.

508
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:22,711
It's a simple matter,
but I am curious about the reason.

509
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:24,422
Why do you ask for such a thing?

510
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:27,258
The reason.

511
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:31,971
Use your imagination

512
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:35,349
until we meet again.

513
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:43,482
We can't do as he says!
Yihan shouldn't hold the scalpel again!

514
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:44,859
No need to make a fuss.

515
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:49,113
What he asked for was unexpected,

516
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:51,282
but it's a cheap price to pay.

517
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:53,075
-But--
-Don't worry.

518
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:56,078
Han Yihan will never become a doctor

519
00:40:57,663 --> 00:40:58,831
again.

520
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:07,673
Why did you do that?

521
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:11,093
You could have asked for something bigger

522
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:12,887
after a performance like this.

523
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:16,182
The piece that determines the game
is the king.

524
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:19,268
But why is the queen stronger?

525
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:21,562
Because the king needs someone
to fight for him.

526
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:26,358
Let me get this straight. That lawyer guy

527
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:28,235
will be your queen?

528
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:29,695
No.

529
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:32,281
Yuna is the queen.

530
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:36,744
My lovely partner
who will support me by my side.

531
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:39,205
Han Yihan is my knight.

532
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:43,292
And a curveball
you don't know where it will go.

533
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:45,294
Doesn't this look fun?

534
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:47,630
The man Chairman Gu Jingi feels
the most threatened by

535
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:49,757
will be my black knight.

536
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,611
Prosecutor Geum.

537
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,949
Nam Hyukchul is waiting
in the interrogation room.

538
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:17,326
Oh, right. Yes.

539
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:18,953
Let's go.

540
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:22,957
Lawyer Han Yihan.

541
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:26,669
If you want to talk to me,
bring him to me.

542
00:42:27,002 --> 00:42:28,712
Why do you want a lawyer all of a sudden?

543
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:32,800
You said you killed him
because you didn't want to go down alone.

544
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:34,218
I thought I did.

545
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:37,096
But I changed my mind.

546
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:39,223
The murder case six years ago.

547
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:40,808
I'll file an appeal.

548
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:42,518
File an appeal?

549
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:44,520
But why do you want Han Yihan?

550
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:46,438
I may be locked up, but I still have ears.

551
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:49,358
He won the trial against Banseok.

552
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:51,610
I can only trust
competent lawyers like him.

553
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:56,615
What? This isn't bad news to you either.

554
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,201
Once my appeal goes through,

555
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:02,663
you will get to hear all the dirty laundry
Banseok is hiding.

556
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:08,586
I don't think I can do that.

557
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:12,047
You're a death-row convict
who killed two doctors from Banseok.

558
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:15,342
Why would I bring in a lawyer
who used to be a doctor at Banseok?

559
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:18,053
What if he becomes the third victim?

560
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:19,555
Who will take responsibility?

561
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:20,973
I won't kill him!

562
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:26,478
I want to put an end
to this sickening prison life I have.

563
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:28,439
You can talk all you want,
but you're not getting him.

564
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:31,650
So tell me if there's any truth
you've been holding back.

565
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:34,111
Or you can get a public defender.

566
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:39,450
What are you doing?

567
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:41,619
You're crazy.

568
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:45,956
-Get me Han Yihan!
-Hey, get your hands off her!

569
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:49,460
Or I'll kill you too!

570
00:43:49,543 --> 00:43:52,046
I'll kill you and myself next. Okay?

571
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:54,798
Go ahead if you can.

572
00:43:57,593 --> 00:43:59,094
Get your hands off her!

573
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:02,097
-Darn it.
-Prosecutor Geum.

574
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:03,265
Are you okay?

575
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:05,768
I'm fine. Call an ambulance first.

576
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:09,772
And keep an eye on him,
so he doesn't try anything stupid thing.

577
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:11,190
-Yes, ma'am.
-Darn it.

578
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:13,484
I…

579
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:20,157
Are you okay?
You should go to the hospital.

580
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:22,660
I'm good. This is nothing.

581
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:26,789
That crazy punk. He wants to appeal now?

582
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:29,875
So he wanted Han Yihan?

583
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:33,212
Yes. He said he wouldn't talk
without Han Yihan.

584
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:38,467
We have no choice. Give him what he wants.

585
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:40,844
Han Yihan will decide
if he wants the case or not.

586
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:43,180
He needs a lawyer anyway.

587
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,311
What? Is it uncomfortable to talk to him?

588
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:52,356
No.

589
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,274
I'll talk to him.

590
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:01,990
Jayden Lee.

591
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:04,410
He was the first Korean American to become

592
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:06,412
the head of the Asian branch
at Honours Hand five years ago.

593
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:08,914
When Banseok Foundation
acquired a hospital in California

594
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:10,541
and set up the R and D Center,

595
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:12,543
Honours Hand invested 300 billion won.

596
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:14,920
Three hundred billion?
How do they have that much money?

597
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:17,715
The company manages enough funds
that could run an entire country.

598
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:20,342
He invests aggressively.
His mergers and acquisitions are hostile.

599
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:22,720
He does whatever it takes
to lobby his cause.

600
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:25,556
He's known as a notorious lobbyist
in the industry.

601
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:28,225
It's the biggest private equity firm
in the world.

602
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:29,351
No way.

603
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:31,311
Yihan, we should ask a lot for our fee.

604
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:33,397
How about 100 million won?
No. A billion won?

605
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,482
No. I won't ask for money.

606
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:37,234
What? Why not?

607
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,654
He promised to restore my medical license

608
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:42,489
and provide us with medical equipment.

609
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:45,534
He will give us what I need the most.

610
00:45:45,617 --> 00:45:47,870
-Restore your license?
-But how is that possible?

611
00:45:48,036 --> 00:45:49,872
Gu Jingi of all people is stopping it.

612
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,165
We'll see.

613
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:55,544
We also need to check
how competent they are.

614
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:59,757
If he can't get that from Gu Jingi,
we don't need to work with him.

615
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:02,634
Gosh.

616
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:04,136
Lim Yuna.

617
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,514
She's the only child of Im Taemoon,
the former ambassador to the US

618
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:09,558
who will run for president next.

619
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:11,059
She's gorgeous.

620
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:14,313
Her mother is Kim Sunhee.
She's currently a diplomat.

621
00:46:14,396 --> 00:46:17,941
She chairs the UN Human Rights Council
and is an ambassador to Geneva.

622
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:23,363
Lim Yuna majored in medical engineering
at Johns Hopkins University.

623
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:26,200
And last year, she worked
as the youngest senior researcher

624
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:28,702
at a global biotech company
at BioValley in Boston.

625
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:31,371
She was recently scouted as the director
of Banseok R and D Center.

626
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:34,124
As the director?
Isn't she too young for that position?

627
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:37,377
She can if she plans to marry his son.

628
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:41,089
She's dating Gu Hyunseong
with marriage in the future.

629
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:43,175
I guess some people already know.

630
00:46:43,383 --> 00:46:45,886
Rumor has it that they will announce
their engagement soon.

631
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:49,431
But this lady is seeing Jayden too?

632
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:52,309
What is this?
The fiancée of Bankseok's heir

633
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:56,063
is having a secret affair
with Banseok's business partner?

634
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:59,650
Gosh. This is
a crazy soap opera in action.

635
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:09,952
What? Hey.

636
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:14,623
<i>We need to meet now.</i>

637
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:16,625
I need to talk to you about Nam Hyukchul.

638
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:18,669
I'll go to your office.

639
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:22,798
I'm not alone here.

640
00:47:22,881 --> 00:47:24,258
Then come to my house.

641
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:26,927
-Your house?
<i>-Yes.</i>

642
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:28,971
Hurry. It's important.

643
00:47:29,054 --> 00:47:30,347
Okay.

644
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:33,350
Is it Seokyeong?

645
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:36,520
Yes.

646
00:47:36,603 --> 00:47:38,480
She needs to talk to me
about Nam Hyukchul.

647
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:39,815
I'll be back.

648
00:48:26,945 --> 00:48:28,196
Seokyeong.

649
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:29,948
Ta-da!

650
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:32,034
You startled me.

651
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:35,787
Here.

652
00:48:36,371 --> 00:48:37,623
What? Are they for me?

653
00:48:39,958 --> 00:48:41,126
Thank you.

654
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:55,265
I'll make a wish.

655
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:59,227
Let's blow them out together.
One, two, three.

656
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:02,814
-Thank you.
-Happy birthday.

657
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:04,441
Happy birthday.

658
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:11,531
What are you doing?

659
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:15,410
Come in. It's fine.

660
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:17,621
Okay.

661
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:25,379
Do you want coffee? I have tea too.

662
00:49:25,712 --> 00:49:27,798
I'm fine with anything.
I'll have what you're having.

663
00:50:07,921 --> 00:50:10,674
I took it out yesterday.

664
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:15,345
I had a lot on my mind
after hearing about Seokju.

665
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:17,639
I found it
when I was going through my stuff.

666
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:27,065
Nam Hyukchul asked to hire you
as his lawyer.

667
00:50:28,233 --> 00:50:31,236
He wants to appeal against the sentence
of the murder case from six years ago.

668
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:36,283
-Appeal?
-Yes.

669
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:38,535
He said he wouldn't hire anyone else.

670
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:40,537
He said it had to be you.

671
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:43,081
He bit up his hand
and created a scene by harming himself.

672
00:50:43,915 --> 00:50:46,376
Well, I'm suspicious of his intention.

673
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:48,211
But I thought I should tell you at least.

674
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:50,630
Could this be a trap?

675
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:54,926
Even if it's a trap, I can't avoid it.

676
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:59,890
Don't worry. I won't jump in recklessly.

677
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:02,476
Even a murderer

678
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:06,855
must cherish his family.

679
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:16,573
BANSEOK UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF MEDICINE
RESERVE OFFICERS' TRAINING CORPS

680
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:22,996
-Is this a photoshoot?
-Pardon?

681
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,665
Why are you trying to look pretty?
It's not a photoshoot.

682
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:29,711
Since it's a dummy, not a real patient,
you think you can just pretend to do it?

683
00:51:30,128 --> 00:51:31,922
-I'll deduct a point.
-Wait.

684
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:34,841
And what kind of nurse would stop
compression while performing CPR?

685
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:36,468
I'll deduct three points.

686
00:51:36,551 --> 00:51:39,221
Wait, Professor! I can keep going.

687
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:42,516
What's the point?

688
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:44,392
The patient already has a cardiac arrest.

689
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:46,645
To recover your points,

690
00:51:46,728 --> 00:51:49,773
you should have used a defibrillator
instead of continuing with CPR.

691
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:54,236
-Professor, I have a question.
-Okay.

692
00:51:54,694 --> 00:51:56,446
When the patient has a cardiac arrest,

693
00:51:56,530 --> 00:52:00,325
if you compress harder,
wouldn't the heart start beating again?

694
00:52:00,408 --> 00:52:01,785
You must watch a lot of TV shows.

695
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:05,580
What? Should we punch the heart
with our fist next?

696
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:07,624
Like this. Like some cool doctor?

697
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:10,127
It's not impossible.

698
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:15,590
Shocking the heart is
also a part of Advanced Life Support.

699
00:52:16,591 --> 00:52:19,344
Then have you done it yourself too?

700
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:21,388
Several times.

701
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:24,141
In the field, it's very common

702
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:26,643
to break the patient's ribs during CPR.

703
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:30,105
Sometimes, you can feel their hearts
with your fingertips.

704
00:52:30,188 --> 00:52:32,440
But despite that,
if you fail to save the patient,

705
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:33,817
you will feel hopeless.

706
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:36,653
And you'll never get used to it
no matter how many times you feel it.

707
00:52:37,445 --> 00:52:41,283
This process may traumatize
some of you here.

708
00:52:41,783 --> 00:52:44,911
But remember
that we're medical professionals.

709
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:48,540
If there's even a one-percent chance
that their hearts can beat again,

710
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:51,001
we never give up on our patients.

711
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:25,160
Who is it?
We're in the middle of our lecture.

712
00:53:25,243 --> 00:53:26,494
Turn off your cell phone.

713
00:53:42,677 --> 00:53:43,511
You…

714
00:53:45,388 --> 00:53:47,015
Let me ask you a question too.

715
00:53:47,515 --> 00:53:49,684
Have you ever done a surgery

716
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:52,896
where you implant a heart
that was implanted in someone else?

717
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:56,399
You must know better than anyone

718
00:53:57,651 --> 00:53:59,569
that it's not possible.

719
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:07,035
We did it together five years ago
with Seokju's heart.

720
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:15,543
Should we continue here? It's fine by me.

721
00:54:24,552 --> 00:54:27,514
APPOINTMENT CEREMONY IN NURSING DEPARTMENT
BANSEOK UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

722
00:54:27,722 --> 00:54:28,890
Should I congratulate you?

723
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:32,143
You became a professor after becoming
the head of the nursing department.

724
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:35,230
You achieved everything
you could as a nurse

725
00:54:36,022 --> 00:54:37,482
as a reward for killing a patient.

726
00:54:38,984 --> 00:54:40,777
You killed him.

727
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:44,864
You're a criminal who lost your license
for violating the Medical Service Act.

728
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:46,074
How dare you come here?

729
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:52,872
Don't come near me.

730
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:55,250
Stop. I said stop!

731
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:59,379
Couples become more alike.
You act just like your husband.

732
00:55:00,505 --> 00:55:02,257
-What?
-I'm sure you know

733
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:04,134
your ex-husband, Nam Hyukchul,

734
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:06,845
killed Park Kitae on Gu Jingi's order.

735
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:09,639
I know nothing about this.

736
00:55:10,223 --> 00:55:12,851
I already ended things with my husband.

737
00:55:12,934 --> 00:55:14,936
I never knew anything about it,
and I still don't.

738
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:17,355
-I don't know anything!
-Nam Junhwan.

739
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:23,987
A 19-year-old boy.

740
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,824
He had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
at the age of 11.

741
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:30,785
He was treated by an internist
with medication at Banseok for years.

742
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:35,999
Gu Jingi gave him

743
00:55:36,082 --> 00:55:39,461
expensive new drugs that weren't
covered by the insurance for free.

744
00:55:39,878 --> 00:55:42,297
So his symptoms improved
without any transplant surgery.

745
00:55:49,554 --> 00:55:50,889
And I looked into the new drugs.

746
00:55:51,973 --> 00:55:53,850
Patients show great improvement
in the beginning.

747
00:55:54,225 --> 00:55:57,479
But once they develop tolerance,
when they relapse, the symptoms get worse.

748
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,691
Your son who had to be
readmitted to the VIP room

749
00:56:02,984 --> 00:56:04,402
makes a good example.

750
00:56:04,736 --> 00:56:07,530
So what? Are you here to gloat?

751
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:09,199
That I deserved it?

752
00:56:09,282 --> 00:56:12,911
No. You will have to face
the consequence of killing Seokju.

753
00:56:12,994 --> 00:56:14,662
Not your innocent son.

754
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:17,332
Then what do you want from me?

755
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:19,751
I'm interviewing Nam Hyukchul tomorrow

756
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:21,503
at the Central District
Prosecutors' Office.

757
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:26,424
Persuade him to tell the truth.

758
00:56:26,674 --> 00:56:28,051
Then I will

759
00:56:29,761 --> 00:56:31,054
save your son.

760
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:51,741
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

761
00:57:15,348 --> 00:57:16,391
It's been a while, Mr. Han.

762
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:22,814
If you're my lawyer,
shouldn't you sit next to me?

763
00:57:22,897 --> 00:57:24,858
I'm not your lawyer yet.

764
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:26,943
You haven't signed any contract yet.

765
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:29,154
You're hurting my feelings.

766
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:31,406
I was going to share
some stories with you.

767
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:36,453
Do prosecutors attend
the meetings with my lawyer?

768
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:39,497
This breaks the confidentiality clause.

769
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:43,001
-I want you to leave us in private.
-I'm not falling for that.

770
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:45,587
Why would I leave you alone with him?

771
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:49,215
Did you forget this crazy stunt
you pulled on me?

772
00:57:50,675 --> 00:57:52,135
Suit yourself.

773
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:55,472
I'm demanding my rights as the defendant.

774
00:57:57,682 --> 00:57:58,975
With you here,

775
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:03,354
I won't tell you anything.

776
00:58:06,566 --> 00:58:08,026
It's fine.

777
00:58:08,526 --> 00:58:09,736
Leave us in private.

778
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:13,781
-But--
-He said it's fine. Okay?

779
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:17,744
Do you think I'd kill him like this?

780
00:58:24,417 --> 00:58:26,628
Be careful. I'll be right outside.

781
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:45,480
Now, talk.

782
00:58:46,397 --> 00:58:49,984
What do you want to say to me
about the case from six years ago?

783
00:58:56,074 --> 00:58:56,991
Sorry.

784
00:58:58,243 --> 00:59:00,328
I didn't want to do this to you.

785
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:02,664
What?

786
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:13,383
VIDEO RECORDING ROOM

787
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:20,765
Nam Junhwan.

788
00:59:22,183 --> 00:59:25,061
If you stab me now, your son will die too.

789
00:59:26,145 --> 00:59:27,272
How did you…

790
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:29,566
Nam Hyukchul.

791
00:59:30,858 --> 00:59:31,734
Drop your weapon.

792
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:35,572
Answer me. How did you know about my son?

793
00:59:35,905 --> 00:59:37,073
How could I not?

794
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:39,867
He's the only child
between you and your wife.

795
00:59:41,786 --> 00:59:42,787
Three years.

796
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:46,291
That's how long it took
for Seokju to find a donor.

797
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,211
Do you think
your son could wait that long?

798
00:59:53,047 --> 00:59:54,048
I can save

799
00:59:54,966 --> 00:59:56,301
Nam Junhwan.

800
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:00,013
Nam Hyukchul.

801
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:03,391
Three years?

802
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:06,227
-He doesn't have that much time.
-Nam Hyukchul!

803
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:07,520
That's why

804
01:00:08,521 --> 01:00:11,232
-I have to kill you!
-Nam Hyukchul!

805
01:00:56,235 --> 01:00:58,279
<i>Do you think
Nam Hyukchul will do what we want?</i>

806
01:00:58,363 --> 01:00:59,447
<i>We should hope so.</i>

807
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:01,449
<i>The man I want to spend
the rest of my life with</i>

808
01:01:01,532 --> 01:01:03,993
<i>isn't the Director
of Planning and Coordination.</i>

809
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:05,912
<i>Are you asking me to become
the chairman of the foundation?</i>

810
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:07,705
I'm asking you to surpass that position.

811
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:09,165
Surpass even your father.

812
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:10,375
<i>I found something interesting.</i>

813
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:12,960
Where did you find this?

814
01:01:13,044 --> 01:01:15,922
<i>I didn't expect much.
But I hit the jackpot.</i>

815
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:18,883
Then does it mean
this person took Seokju's heart?

816
01:01:18,966 --> 01:01:20,968
<i>You and Chairman Gu
will meet again at last.</i>

817
01:01:21,052 --> 01:01:22,470
<i>I'm getting excited for you.</i>

818
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:25,181
<i>It's your turn to bleed now.</i>

819
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:27,600
<i>I knew it. I can never predict his moves.</i>

820
01:01:36,609 --> 01:01:38,611
