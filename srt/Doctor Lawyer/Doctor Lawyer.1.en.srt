<i>Doctors aren't gods!</i>

<i>-Doctors aren't gods!
-Doctors aren't gods!</i>

<i>Revoke their license to kill!</i>

<i>Stop the coercive investigation!</i>

00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:27,527
<i>-Stop it!
-Stop it!</i>

10
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,070
<i>Banseok University Medical Center,
an evil group!</i>

11
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:31,156
<i>Apologize to the public!</i>

12
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:32,907
<i>-Apologize!
-Apologize!</i>

<i>Repressed doctors. Failed medical system!</i>

<i>-Repressed doctors!
-Failed medical system!</i>

15
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:38,371
<i>Our nation will collapse!</i>

<i>-It will collapse!
-It will collapse!</i>

17

<i>The trial for the Hojun Case is about to…</i>

18
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:47,672
Seven-year-old Hojun, who was brought
to the emergency room for rhabdomyolysis,

19
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:51,009
died of acute renal failure due to
poor medical treatment by the doctor.

20
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:53,094
The conflict between civic groups
and the medical association

21
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:56,139
is intensifying over the passage
of the "Hojun Act," which will strengthen

22
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:57,849
<i>criminal penalties
for medical malpractice.</i>

23
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,477
<i>Dr. Park, who has
repeatedly denied the allegations,</i>

24
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,064
<i>is said to have admitted to the charge
of his poor medical treatment</i>

25
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:05,273
<i>at the trial today.</i>

26
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:07,025
<i>Prosecutor Geum Seokyeong
of the Medical Crime Department</i>

27
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:08,234
<i>at Seoul Central District
Prosecutors' Office</i>

28
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:11,071
<i>asked for a two-year sentence for Dr. Park
of Banseok University Medical Center,</i>

29
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:13,156
<i>who is accused of professional negligence</i>

30
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,866
<i>and violation of medical law.</i>

31
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:16,951
<i>Gu Jingi, director
of Banseok University Medical Center</i>

32
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,119
<i>and chairman of the foundation,</i>

33
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:21,706
<i>is likely to replace Lee Giljae,
the former Minister of Health and Welfare,</i>

34
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,167
<i>who recently resigned on bribery charges.</i>

35
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,627
<i>This is expected to cause a stir.</i>

36
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:28,963
<i>As it is a case of public interest,
some predict that the outcome of the trial</i>

37
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:32,175
<i>may affect the appointment of candidates.</i>

38
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,432
Defendant. Please rise.

39
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:54,697
I will announce the sentence.

40
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,325
It is recognized
that the defendant Park Kitae

41
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:59,744
neglected his duty of care

42
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:02,664
to his patient as a doctor.

43
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:05,208
Accordingly, the court acknowledges

44
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:08,837
that the defendant Park Kitae
caused the death of the young victim

45
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,215
due to professional negligence…

46
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,892
Thus, the court sentences him
to two years…

47
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:25,770
Defendant.

48
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:29,524
Defendant. Are you all right?

49
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:42,120
Defendant!
Please check on him immediately.

50
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,708
Mr. Park Kitae. Can you hear me?

51
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,751
Defendant! Mr. Park Kitae!

52
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:53,590
There is no heartbeat.

53
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,008
What in the world…

54
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:58,261
-AED! Please bring a defibrillator now.
-Yes, Your Honor.

<i>Dr. Park, who was on trial,</i>

57
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:08,730
<i>collapsed due to breathing difficulties

58

59

Cardiac arrest?

60
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:14,819
<i>The court officer
performed CPR on Dr. Park immediately,</i>

61
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,488
<i>but it seems that
he has not yet regained consciousness.</i>

<i>The trial against him has been suspended.</i>

-Quickly.
-Yes, sir.

65
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:47,435
Please step back.

66
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,564
What's going on? Why isn't it working?

67
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,191
Dang.

68
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:57,195
-What about the ambulance?
-I called for it already.

69
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:23,846
-Who is that?
-What?

70
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,234
Han Yihan.

71
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:42,907
What on earth are you doing here?

72
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:57,839
What are you doing?

73
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,300
You're not a doctor anymore.

74
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:03,219
Then, should I just leave him to die?

75
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:07,598
Please step aside.

76
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,767
-Who are you?
-I'm his lawyer.

77
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,019
Pardon?

78
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,827
He is breathing!

79
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,455

<i>Anaphylaxis. It's obstructing his airway.</i>

00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:08,659
Please hold this.

84
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:39,524
Please pour the alcohol.

85
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:46,197
Hold his head and legs down.

86
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:51,828
Please hold him down tighter.
He'll die if he moves.

87
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,837
<i>The courtroom is like an operating room.</i>

88
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:04,132

00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:08,136
<i>or provide a fresh start.</i>

SURGERY IN PROGRESS

92
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,920
All good with the vital signs, right?
Let's stop the pump.

93
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,547
-Clamp.
-Okay.

94
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:49,594
One, two, three.

95
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,558
Anesthesiologist, please check the valve.

96
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,102
Valve leaflets are working fine,

97
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,229
and there is no paravalvular leak.

98
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,731
Well done.

99
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,616
I see that the aorta is a bit thin.

100
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,242
It may bleed, so press it down well.

101
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,470
Gauze.

102
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:36,891
One, two, three.

103
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,673

Army Navy retractor.

105
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,606
What are you doing?

106
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:29,902
Focus.

107
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,990
Gosh, you're so awesome.

108
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:37,410
How do your fingers move
as fast as Usain Bolt?

109
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:41,455
That surgery would take four hours
at least. How can you finish in two hours?

110
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:44,458
The longer it takes,
it puts the patient under extra strain.

111
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:47,169
Hey man, others don’t take longer
on purpose.

112
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,589
You modest, annoying punk.

113
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:53,426
You must be a god.
The rest of us are mere human doctors.

114
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,886
He's not just quick. He's also precise.

115
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,972
Yihan, you're off now, right?

116
00:09:58,055 --> 00:09:59,849
Yes. But I'll still be here,

117
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,392
-so call me if any emergency arises.
-Okay.

118
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:05,146
To the patient, the long-term outcome is
more important than the surgery duration.

119
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,858
-Please check his condition often.
-Yes, I will.

120
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:12,737
He is handsome and is always right,
so I can't even complain.

121
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:15,990
He's going to see Seokju now, right?

122
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,158
Yes.

123
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:19,118
Gosh, he has amazing stamina.

124
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:21,579
He performed
three surgeries back to back today.

125
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:23,581
But it's an important day for Seokju.

126
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,750
Oh, right. It's an important day.

127
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:29,462
-Dang.
-Life isn't fair. We have to work hard.

128
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:30,880
Let's go.

129
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:33,424
What are you doing?
Good hygiene is a must here.

Submit your answer sheet.

134
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,230
How is your condition? Are you okay?

135
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,357
Of course. I am totally fine.

136
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:17,236
Don't overexert yourself.

137
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:20,030
Let me know right away
if you feel shortness of breath or pain.

138
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:21,240
Of course.

139
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,868
By the way, where is my sister?

140
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:26,412
She said she would take half a day off.
She isn't here yet?

141
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,039
You are right. She is late.

142
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:33,878
She must be here.

143
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:36,422

<i>Yihan, I need you to operate.</i>

146
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,478
There is someone we need to save.

147
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,271
He got stabbed in the chest.

148
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:54,315
He is on his way
to Banseok University Medical Center.

149
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:56,066
Stabbed?

150
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:58,944
Switch to video call
and show me the wound.

151
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,112
Okay.

152
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,453
Paramedic, please tell me
about the patient's condition.

153
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:10,456
He has lost a lot of blood
and his vital signs are very low.

154
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:12,333
So that his blood pressure won't drop,
we found the vein…

155
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:13,793
and are injecting IV fluids.

156
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:15,920
Is there a cardiac stimulant?

157
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,588
Yes. We have epinephrine.

158
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:19,215
We can't let his heart stop.

159
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,258
Please administer
one ampule through the IV line.

160
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:24,011
This video is being recorded
and I will take full responsibility.

161
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:25,137
<i>Okay.</i>

162
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,065
<i>Good job.</i>

163
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:39,193
Please come to the entrance
of the main building. I will be there.

164
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:41,028
Not the emergency center,
but the main building?

165
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:44,740
Yes. I will check up on the patient
and operate myself.

166
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,033
Understood.

167
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:53,457
Seokju.

168
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:55,626
Go ahead. I am okay.

169
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:59,797
Call the medical staff
if you feel the slightest pain, okay?

170
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:01,674
Don't worry.

171
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,385
I know my heart better than you.

172
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,637
Okay. I will be back.

173
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,515
Good luck.

174
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,188
BANSEOK UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

175
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,778
AMBULANCE

176
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:27,074
Yihan.

177
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,544
Lift on the count of three.
One, two, three.

178
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,341
What happened?

179
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,468
He was supposed
to be summoned for an investigation.

180
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,429
When I went to him,
he hurt himself with a knife.

181
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:50,431
Call his guardian. We will operate now.

182
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:52,016
-Okay.
-Yihan.

183
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:55,227
Yosub, check his blood
and call the operating room.

184
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,353
Okay.

185
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:03,068
Blood pressure, 80 over 45.
Heart rate, 145bpm.

186
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,194
Oxygen saturation level, 85%.

187
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,863
-Maintain blood volume.
-Yes, doctor.

188
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:07,156
Let's make a bypass first.

189
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,199
If it can't keep up with the blood flow,

190
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,201
we will open up his chest
and add a cannula to the aorta.

191
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,620
Okay.

192
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:26,300
Doctor, the blood bank
has two bags of Blood Type A left.

193
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,011
We won't have enough blood.

194
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:32,014
Even with a blood transfusion,
the BP will fall below 50.

195
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,229
He is in terrible condition.

196
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,358
Yihan, will he be able to survive
this surgery?

197
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,735
Don't say that
when the patient is still breathing.

198
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:46,445
He is barely breathing.

199
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,822
Focus. The surgery has begun.

200
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:56,455
Going in.

201
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,098
-What's the ACT?
-It's going over 320 seconds.

202
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:15,849
Start the pump.

203
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,396
The flow is at 50%.

204
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:23,107
Let's open the chest
and insert a drain to the right atrium.

205
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,110
Skin incision.

206
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,829
SURGICAL TIMER, CURRENT TIME,
ANESTHESIA TIMER

207
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,541
Remove it on the count of three.
Prepare for bleeding.

208
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,835
One, two, three.

209
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:52,928
His blood pressure will drop soon.

210
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,813
BP, 70 over 30. It's dropping.

211
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:05,190
-Shoot in one ampule of epinephrine.
-Epinephrine going in.

212
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,316
Shoot.

213
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,402
It's the left ventricle.
How far did the knife go in?

214
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:09,778
Suction.

215
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,364
BP, 55 over 35.

216
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:13,991
Oxygen saturation level, 55%.
They keep dropping.

217
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,368
Give him norepinephrine
and keep checking the vital signs.

218
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,078
-How about blood?
-What we have now is all.

219
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:20,748
Let's use a suction pump.

220
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:22,207
-Purse-string suture for the right atrium.
-Okay.

221
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:29,089
-Help me see it clearly.
-Okay.

222
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:41,894
Hand me the ACC.

223
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:45,439
Cardioplegia solution going in.

224
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:53,614
Forceps.

225
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,033
One more.

226
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,998
A cut on the left ventricle.

227
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,958
It's a miracle he made it this far.

228
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,669
I will suture the wound.
Teflon felt strip, Four Zero Prolene.

229
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:47,543
BP, 120 over 85.

230
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,837
Heart rate, 70bpm.
Oxygen saturation level, 100%.

231
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,296
His vital signs are good.

232
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,056
Gosh.

233
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,267
You are obstructing my view!

234
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,564
-Suction.
-Suction.

235
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:12,151
The ST segment is too high.

236
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,652
Give me Isoket and prepare
the rapid infusion system.

237
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:15,112
-Yes.
-Isoket.

238
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:17,322
Suction! I can't see anything!

239
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,877
Turn off the music.

240
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:31,503
-Do a gauze count.
-Okay.

241
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,714
-No more epinephrine?
-That was the last ampule.

242
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:35,757
I told you to prepare them.
Go and bring more.

243
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:36,675
Yes, doctor.

244
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:39,761
For goodness' sake.

245
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:00,532
The vital signs are stable.

246
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,785
Han Yihan, you are the best.

247
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:04,995
You are insane.

248
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:08,916
The patient had almost encountered death,

249
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,584
but you managed to bring him back to life.

250
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:16,632
What is this? Who brought a cell phone
to the operating room?

251
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,342
-Wrap it up.
-What?

252
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:19,801
Take over.

253
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,011
Okay.

254
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:24,514
-Where are you going?
-Where are you going?

255
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,016
Close the chest and wrap up.

256
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:28,977
You were so intent on operating.
You should wrap it up.

257
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,188
Gosh, I am anxious.

258
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,899
Let's do well.
It's all about mental fortitude.

259
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:36,944
Focus.

260
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:40,030
Yihan, what happened?

261
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:41,907
It ended well.
They are closing up his chest.

262
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,243
His chest? Then it hasn't ended yet.

263
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,078
Another emergency came up.

264
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:47,996
Don't worry. Dr. Park is in there.

265
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:50,415
You should go to Seokju.

266
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:53,543
He is taking the exam,
so you should be by his side.

267
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:54,920
Okay.

268
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:57,714
-I will be there when I am done.
-Okay. Good luck.

269
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:10,060
BANSEOK UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

270
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,256
<i>He must be in trouble again.</i>

271
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,764
Come on! It's slippery here.
Wipe the blood.

272
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:48,932
BP is 65 over 30.

273
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:50,309
Oxygen saturation level, 85%.

274
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:52,394
-I need more blood here.
-This is all we have.

275
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,479
He's Rh-negative. I barely got three bags.

276
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:55,397
Put an IV fluid on him!

277
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,107
If his blood pressure drops more,
he'll die!

278
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,692
-Yes, sir.
-Your call, Dr. Gu.

279
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:00,235
Should I make an announcement?

280
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,407
He might have a cardiac arrest.

281
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,284
You should at least massage his heart.

282
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:08,410
Dr. Gu. What do we do?

283
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:11,204
-Dr. Gu.
-Dr. Gu. Tell us what to do.

284
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,540
-Dr. Gu.
-Dr. Gu!

285
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:15,667
BP is 50 over 30.
He's about to have a cardiac arrest.

286
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,336
Dr. Gu!

287
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:20,839
-Dr. Gu!
-Dr. Gu.

288
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,417
How's the patient?

289
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,669
BP, 50 over 20.
Oxygen saturation level, 80%.

290
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:01,630
His sinus is bad.
He might have a cardiac arrest.

291
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:02,756
Push two of epinephrine.

292
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,383
Pushing two of epinephrine.

293
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:08,553
-Suction, and start the cell saver.
-Yes, sir.

294
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,850
Doctor! I got it.

295
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:15,560
Water syringe, please.

296
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:21,733
Walk me through.

297
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:23,693
Well…

298
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:26,822
He was performing
a coronary artery bypass graft.

299
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,740
He must have nicked another vessel.

300
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:31,618
Micro forceps.

301
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:37,374
-Keep watering it. Blow it.
-Yes, sir.

302
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:39,251
Keep suctioning.

303
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:10,866
<i>Given the amount of blood loss,</i>

304
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:13,910
<i>he should use a coronary shunt.</i>

305
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:17,038
Give me a shunt.

306
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,345
Suture, Eight Zero Prolene.

307
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:50,405
What a monster.

308
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:58,705
-Cut it short.
-Yes, sir.

309
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:08,757
His rhythm is good.

310
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:13,386
Good work. Thanks to you, the patient…

311
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:24,481
Good work.

312
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:42,541
Dr. Gu.

313
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,126
Dr. Gu!

314
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:48,296
You must perform surgery.

315
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:13,738
I'll close up his chest.

316
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:19,995
<i>Where's your head at?</i>

317
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:22,956
Were you plotting together to screw me?

318
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:24,249
Never.

319
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:27,085
"Good work"? You little…

320
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,337
Do you know who our patient was?

321
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:32,591
He's the father-in-law of the Health
and Welfare Committee's chairman.

322
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,467
He's our biggest VIP patient.

323
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:36,469
The director's son
personally performed the surgery.

324
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:38,888
Can't you read what's going on?

325
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:40,473
Dr. Han was a mere ghost doctor.

326
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:42,809
How dare you compliment him
in front of Dr. Gu?

327
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:45,103
I'm sorry. I had no idea.

328
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:46,521
Keep this in mind.

329
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:49,649
Dr. Han never set foot in this room today.

330
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:52,402
Dr. Gu Hyunseong did the surgery
from start to finish.

331
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:54,321
He saved the patient. Got it?

332
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:55,780
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

333
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,782
-Clean up and go.
-Okay.

334
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:00,952
Jeez.

335
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:05,749
You have five minutes left.
Mark your answers.

336
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,801
KOREAN HISTORY AND SOCIAL STUDIES

337
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:32,859
I'm sorry.
The surgery ran longer than I thought.

338
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:33,943
How's Seokju?

339
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:35,195
He's fine.

340
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:38,198
Daewoong came and checked
his vital signs during his break.

341
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,866
His exam is about to end soon.

342
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:06,184
Kid, are you all right?

343
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:08,728
Can I get a new answer sheet?

344
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:10,814
Your answer sheet?

345
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:14,275
You only have three minutes left.
But shouldn't we get a doctor first?

346
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,485
No.

347
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:17,904
Give me the answer sheet now.
Hurry, please.

348
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:19,823
Okay.

349
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:25,578
Here.

350
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:28,373
GEUM SEOKJU

351
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:41,845
Are you sure you're okay?

352
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:43,513
Gosh. What should I do?

353
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:44,597
I'm…

354
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:47,684
I'm fine.

355
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:51,521
I can finish the exam.

356
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:03,116
Seokju! Geum Seokju!

357
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:04,451
Don't come in!

358
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:07,370
Don't.

359
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:11,624
If they come in now,
my exam won't count. Right?

360
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:13,793
That's the rule, but…

361
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:16,546
I'm fine. Don't come in. Just wait.

362
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:20,258
-It'll be over soon.
-But you…

363
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:22,302
Don't worry.

364
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:25,597
This doesn't even hurt that much anymore.

365
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:29,058
I can do this. No.

366
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:32,604
I will do this no matter what.

367
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:36,941
Seokju.

368
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:40,153
Seokyeong, I'm sure he'll be okay.

369
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,165
Let's believe in him.

370
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:57,045
It's over.

371
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:00,548
Seokju.

372
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:02,801
Seokju. Are you okay?

373
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:05,011
Yihan. Please do something.

374
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:08,348
Seokju.

375
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:14,229
Seriously. You're so fussy.

376
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:17,065
I told you I was fine.

377
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:20,985
Come on.

378
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:23,696
You idiot!

379
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:26,616
-What were you thinking? Seriously!
-Hey.

380
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:29,452
Seokyeong, I'm in pain.

381
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:30,787
I'm still a patient.

382
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,789
Only when you need to get out of trouble?

383
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:35,208
You couldn't have been okay.
I bet it hurt like crazy.

384
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:39,170
You'd better get good grades
after what you just pulled.

385
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:41,339
Otherwise, we're going to…

386
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:45,885
Good job.

387
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:52,725
<i>They are relatively prime,
so you add 17 and 6. And you get 26.</i>

388
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:57,480
<i>Some of you might think why I ended here
when it's a probability question.</i>

389
00:30:57,564 --> 00:31:00,400
<i>Then you will have to study
about conditional probability.</i>

390
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:03,987
<i>In conditional probability,
the total number of outcomes is the same.</i>

391
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:06,823
<i>So you have to remember to…</i>

392
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:11,494
Seokyeong,
can you pull my ear like before?

393
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:14,205
What? Okay.

394
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:17,542
Wait. That doesn't hurt.

395
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:21,963
I must be dreaming. Yes. This is a dream.

396
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:24,883
-Hey, pull mine.
-Okay.

397
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:28,595
-Any pain?
-None.

398
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:30,054
-What?
-We must be dreaming.

399
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:31,764
Is it really happening?

400
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:41,691
Oh, my goodness! You got a perfect score!

401
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:46,446
You did so well!
I'm so proud of you, my baby brother.

402
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:50,158
I can't believe this!

403
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,536
-Seokyeong, I got a perfect score!
-Yes.

404
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,997
-Hey, your heart.
-My heart?

405
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,415
Calm down. Don't get excited.

406
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:59,667
-Whatever! Gosh.
-Gosh!

407
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,878
I don't care if my heart stops beating!

408
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:04,130
How could I not get excited right now?

409
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:09,093
Seokyeong, didn't I tell you?

410
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:10,887
I'll be a med student
at Banseok University.

411
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,889
I'll fix patients
with heart problems like me.

412
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:17,101
I'm going to be the best
cardiothoracic surgeon like Dr. Han!

413
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:21,481
Okay. I'm so proud of you.
You did so well, Seokju.

414
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:24,567
Great job. You were amazing.

415
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:26,945
Well done. My goodness.

416
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,283
A perfect score!

417
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,243
I bet my brother is the first student

418
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:37,497
to take the exam in the hospital
and get a perfect score in history.

419
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,582
I saw it, but I still can't believe it.

420
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,584
Can you believe it?

421
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:44,921
I have news that will make you happier
than Seokju's perfect score.

422
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:47,382
What news? What is it?

423
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:50,134
Come on, tell me.
What could possibly make me happier…

424
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:57,100
No way.

425
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:01,688
Seokju…

426
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:04,816
will get a new heart.

427
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,777
The transplant center called this morning.

428
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:10,863
The donor's family is abroad right now.

429
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:13,533
So we'll procure the organ
and do the transplant in three days.

430
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:16,077
I wanted to tell you sooner.

431
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:18,246
But I didn't want to distract him
before the exam.

432
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:22,792
We…

433
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:25,294
We waited too long for this.

434
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,506
It was painful even for me.

435
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:31,843
Seokju must have been
in so much pain and scared all this time.

436
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:38,433
That means my brother
will be healthy now, right?

437
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:40,852
Just like other kids, he can go to school

438
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:44,397
and make friends too.
He can do all of that, right?

439
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,441
Of course.

440
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:51,362
I will make it my mission
to get him healthy

441
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:55,575
and ready to start his semester
at Banseok University in March.

442
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,953
And once he does,

443
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:01,330
we should…

444
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:13,801
get married.

445
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:30,276
You, Seokju, my mother,

446
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:31,861
and me.

447
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:36,407
The four of us can be happy together.

448
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,080
Thank you.

449
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:46,125
Let's be happy for the rest of our lives.

450
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,728
BANSEOK UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

451
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,443
-Hello.
-Hello.

452
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:16,989
BANSEOK UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

453
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:21,369
<i>We had a 130-billion-won deficit
over the last three years.</i>

454
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:25,081
You spent 200 billion won from
the reserve fund for essential business

455
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:26,707
to set up
a global research and development center.

456
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:27,625
But for three years,

457
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:31,129
the center annually wasted
30 billion won on their research.

458
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:33,673
Technically, it's an investment,
not a waste.

459
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:37,009
We can't survive just by treating patients
and performing operations

460
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:38,636
in the future.

461
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:41,139
To become a global bio-healthcare company

462
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:43,891
from a general hospital,

463
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,893
we must enter the medical market in the US

464
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:47,979
and develop our technology.

465
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:51,899
No. Hospitals must only focus
on treating the patients.

466
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,902
What are you talking about?
A global company?

467
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:57,822
The reserve fund
for essential business was meant

468
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:00,074
to be used to train medical personnel

469
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,076
and to set up the infrastructure.

470
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:05,746
That's why this fund is exempt from taxes.

471
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:09,375
You can't treat this fund
like it's your personal asset.

472
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:10,918
Hey, Jungok.

473
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,379
Are you lecturing me?

474
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:16,174
We're at an official meeting.
Don't call me by my name.

475
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:18,176
Address me as the chairwoman.

476
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:20,094
Director Jang Yoontae.

477
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,721
An official meeting?

478
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:25,725
Jingi, let's be honest here.

479
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:27,602
You're using the foundation's money

480
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:30,646
to set up Banseokwon
and the research and development center

481
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,690
because of your inferiority complex.

482
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:36,652
You were the first work student
our foundation sponsored.

483
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:38,905
You grew up in a poor family.

484
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:41,449
As a man from a humble family,
you have an inferiority complex.

485
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:44,577
You're the one
with the inferiority complex.

486
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,329
-What?
-You know I'm right!

487
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:48,789
Father sent you abroad,
so you could become a doctor.

488
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:51,292
But you kept causing trouble
and couldn't even graduate!

489
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:54,754
So you never became the chairman
nor the hospital director.

490
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:56,005
How dare you?

491
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:58,674
Hey, stop it.
There's no point talking about it.

492
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:00,134
We'll hold you responsible

493
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,178
for your management decisions
at our next board meeting.

494
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:04,263
We won't provide you with any more funds!

495
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:07,975
If you can't cover up the deficit,
be ready to resign from your positions!

496
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:20,154
They only wasted our funds
with their bad investment calls.

497
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:22,865
Since when were they interested
in managing the hospital?

498
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:25,743
Don't they know we made Banseok
one of the top five hospitals?

499
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:28,287
You had to fix politicians

500
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:30,790
and rich businessmen's hearts
all these years to achieve that.

501
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:33,834
They couldn't even squeak
when my father was alive.

502
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,461
How dare they?

503
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:38,464
I'll meet up with other board members
and try to convince them,

504
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,841
but I'm not sure if it will work

505
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,551
since my brothers probably
got to them already.

506
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,012
See you at home.

507
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:47,348
Okay. See you at home.

508
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:04,031
The offer you made.

509
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:06,409
Is it still on the table?

510
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:11,080
They got us good this time.

511
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:13,374
They obviously threw him under the bus.

512
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:15,793
It's obvious, but it's effective.

513
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:18,587
Given the chief aide's condition,
even if he recovers,

514
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,881
I don't think we can investigate.

515
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,592
What about
Assemblywoman Yoon Misun's illegal fund?

516
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:26,095
Our hands are tied. We must close it.

517
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:30,349
We're not giving up.
We're letting it stew.

518
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:32,018
I'm sure you know

519
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:34,812
some things are bound to get out.

520
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:39,942
That's a new ring.

521
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:41,861
Did he propose?

522
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:43,404
Oh, this…

523
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:47,491
He told me he would make us happy.

524
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:48,993
Seokju and me.

525
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:51,954
So I said yes right away.

526
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:53,914
Congratulations.

527
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:57,168
You will get busy with Seokju's surgery
and wedding planning now.

528
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,754
Hand over this case to me.
I'll wrap it up.

529
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:03,132
No. I was the one who found this case.

530
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:04,633
So I'll see it through.

531
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:19,190
Great.

532
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:22,109
All the test results look good.

533
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:25,571
You can get your surgery
in two days as we planned.

534
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:32,161
That's great. I was really worried.

535
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:33,788
Why would you worry?

536
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:36,207
You withstood the long battle.

537
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:39,001
You just need this surgery, and that's it.

538
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:43,172
Well, now that I'm getting the surgery,

539
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:45,257
I'm even more nervous.

540
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:50,346
To be honest,
I've been scared all my life.

541
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:54,600
I never talked about this
because I didn't want to worry Seokyeong.

542
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:58,771
But I was scared because I didn't know…

543
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:01,649
when my heart would stop.

544
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,027
I will be grateful for the rest of my life

545
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:08,489
and become a good doctor
as well as a good adult.

546
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,284
Thank you so much, Dr. Han.

547
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:15,037
Thank you, Yihan.

548
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:19,708
Sure.

549
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:24,422
Be an excellent doctor and give back
to the world for the rest of your life.

550
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:36,559
Yes, Director Gu.

551
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:39,228
Dinner?

552
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:41,355
Okay.

553
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:45,025
I'll go to your house. Okay.

554
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:56,996
Good work yesterday.

555
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:01,459
Because of my lacking son,

556
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:04,378
I'm always in your debt.

557
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:06,172
Don't mention it.

558
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:08,215
I just saved a patient
as any doctor would.

559
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:13,304
Seokju's heart transplant surgery
is in two days, right?

560
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:17,183
Yes. He will now have a chance
to get the transplant surgery

561
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:19,143
thanks to your support.

562
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:23,397
Have the surgery at Banseokwon.

563
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:27,693
I'll settle all the bills. Don't worry.

564
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:30,779
But…

565
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:34,700
all the medical expenses
you covered for us…

566
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:38,412
He's the brother of someone
you deeply care about. Of course, I can.

567
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:40,331
No need to feel bad. Just accept it.

568
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,709
This is nothing
compared to everything you've done

569
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,461
for my son.

570
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:48,839
Thank you so much.

571
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:51,842
-Have a drink.
-Yes.

572
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:57,556
Hey, come here. Join us for a drink.

573
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:02,895
I'm tired. I'll get some rest.

574
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:04,855
Come sit.

575
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:07,483
You should hear it too.

576
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:24,124
During the next personnel transfer,

577
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:28,671
I'm going to appoint you
as Head of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Yihan.

578
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:35,177
Father. What are you talking about?

579
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:37,388
That position should be given to me.

580
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:38,722
Hyunseong.

581
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:42,434
You know one's skills are most important
in cardiothoracic surgery.

582
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:43,394
But…

583
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:50,776
"I think of you as a son.
I treasure you like my own."

584
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:54,113
I can't say those things to you.

585
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:56,448
Because that would be a lie.

586
00:42:57,157 --> 00:42:58,325
In return,

587
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,828
I, Gu Jingi, will repay you

588
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:04,582
for all the help you've given Hyunseong.

589
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:10,838
You should have a drink too.

590
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:14,675
I hope that I could see the two of you…

591
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:18,387
lead Banseok…

592
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,973
together.

593
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:26,937
I'll work harder.

594
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:28,147
Okay.

595
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:52,880
Hello, Mr. Cheon.

596
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:57,092
This is from Director Gu.

597
00:43:57,676 --> 00:43:59,178
It's to repay you for all your help.

598
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:00,846
Oh, I see.

599
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:03,724
Please tell him I said thank you.

600
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:06,477
Okay. Goodbye.

601
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:13,651
Goodness.

602
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:15,944
Was he embarrassed
to give it to me himself?

603
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:17,571
You must be happy.

604
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:20,616
You got the position you always wanted.

605
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,077
Of course I'm happy.

606
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:26,080
We have one of the top cardiothoracic
surgery programs in the world.

607
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:29,249
Right. He must be so happy too.

608
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:31,293
I'm talking about your dead father.

609
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:34,171
Imagine how proud he is.

610
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:37,091
He wanted to become
Head of Cardiothoracic Surgery,

611
00:44:37,257 --> 00:44:39,426
so he did an impossible surgery
and killed his patient.

612
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:42,554
Then he got caught taking bribes,
so he killed himself out of embarrassment.

613
00:44:43,263 --> 00:44:46,058
His son managed to fulfill the dream
he couldn't realize.

614
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:48,560
Should I say this is moving?

615
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:50,688
Or should I say it's tragic?

616
00:44:58,028 --> 00:45:01,323
Regardless,
I don't think you're one to talk.

617
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:03,242
If it wasn't for me,

618
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:05,619
you would've killed a lot of patients too.

619
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:07,788
What?

620
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:11,041
I get you're mad because I've been chosen
as Head of Cardiothoracic Surgery,

621
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:13,252
but don't express
your inferiority complex like this.

622
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:16,296
Or get acknowledged with your talent.

623
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:18,340
Although it won't be easy.

624
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:20,384
Bye.

625
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:30,018
Dang.

626
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:42,156
Dad!

627
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:44,283
Dad. No.

628
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:47,035
No.

629
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:51,582
<i>No, Dad.</i>

630
00:45:52,207 --> 00:45:53,834
<i>-Honey.
-Dad.</i>

631
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:21,779
<i>Clean water is seen before us.</i>

632
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:26,074
Hey. You're home late.

633
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:29,036
Did you drink?

634
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:31,079
Yes. I had a drink with the director.

635
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:33,749
The director? Why?

636
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:37,753
He gave me permission to do
Seokju's surgery at Banseokwon.

637
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:39,671
He's even going to cover the cost.

638
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:44,384
Oh, my gosh. I'm so grateful.

639
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:49,139
When I heard the surgery was going to cost
over 30 million won,

640
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:52,226
I thought that I should help pay for it.

641
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:53,977
My gosh.

642
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:56,939
You care more about Seokyeong than me.

643
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:02,152
I have some more good news.

644
00:47:03,445 --> 00:47:06,740
My angel, Madame Kang, your son is

645
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:08,700
the new Head of Cardiothoracic Surgery
at Banseok University Medical Center.

646
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:10,744
The youngest one in its history.

647
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:12,788
Head of Cardiothoracic Surgery?

648
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:16,959
How can you become the head
when Hyunseong is there too?

649
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:20,754
Your skills are most important
in cardiothoracic surgery.

650
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:22,798
As for Hyunseong…

651
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:26,093
I'm sure the director
will give him a better position.

652
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:30,806
What is it? Aren't you happy?

653
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:34,643
I'm happy. I really am,

654
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:38,063
but I'm reminded of your father.

655
00:47:39,481 --> 00:47:41,066
If he was still alive,

656
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:44,319
he'd be so happy with us.

657
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:49,950
What a terrible man.
How could he leave us like that?

658
00:47:52,494 --> 00:47:54,288
Goodness, Madame Kang.

659
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:57,499
Why are you acting like this
on such a happy day?

660
00:47:57,583 --> 00:48:00,460
-Did you take your medicine today?
-No.

661
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:05,007
When I take it,
my stomach feels uncomfortable.

662
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:06,592
You should still take it.

663
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:09,177
I know you still have a hard time
when you think about Dad.

664
00:48:09,761 --> 00:48:13,390
If it upsets your stomach,
I'll get you a different prescription.

665
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:41,376
Is it more than one bottle?
Why is it so heavy?

666
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:50,719
What is this? Is this money?

667
00:48:51,219 --> 00:48:53,597
<i>I, Gu Jingi, will repay you</i>

668
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,891
for all the help you've given Hyunseong.

669
00:48:57,684 --> 00:48:59,686
When he said repay me, did he mean…

670
00:49:02,397 --> 00:49:03,899
Even still, this is wrong.

671
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:06,610
I should return this to him.

672
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:23,085
Good luck with your surgery.
I'll be waiting outside.

673
00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:24,962
It's not like I'm doing anything.

674
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:27,047
I'll be going to sleep once I'm in there.

675
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:28,799
I'm sure Dr. Han will do his best.

676
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:30,968
Yihan.

677
00:49:33,887 --> 00:49:35,681
So don't worry about anything and wait.

678
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:38,016
I'll come back with a strong new heart.

679
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,310
We'll go in now.

680
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:41,895
-Please take good care of him.
-I will.

681
00:49:43,605 --> 00:49:45,816
-Good luck, Seokju.
-Bye.

682
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:47,567
Good luck. Don't worry.

683
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:49,444
-I'll be back!
-Geum Seokju, you can do it!

684
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:57,494
Yihan.

685
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:00,539
Take good care of Seokju for me.

686
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:03,291
Don't worry. I'll do my best.

687
00:50:04,209 --> 00:50:08,213
No. I'll make sure it's successful.
No matter what.

688
00:50:12,217 --> 00:50:13,510
Good luck.

689
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:34,990
Hand me the ACC.

690
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:41,246
ACC is on.

691
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:43,498
The pump flow is good.

692
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:47,294
-Daewoong, what's the time?
-It's 12:27 p.m.

693
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:53,175
I will now extract the patient's heart.

694
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:20,327
The heart has arrived.

695
00:51:33,006 --> 00:51:34,716
It's 1:21 p.m.

696

CURRENT TIME
SURGICAL TIMER, ANESTHESIA TIMER

697
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:47,521
I'll start suturing the left atrium.

00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:28,562
SURGERY IN PROGRESS
PATIENT NAME: GEUM, SURGEON: HAN YIHAN

701
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:41,783
Raise his body temperature.

702
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:45,162
Turn on the root vent.

703
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:47,664
The ACC is coming off.

704
00:52:50,041 --> 00:52:52,460
When the body temperature goes up,
start weaning the pump.

705
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:55,839
Full flow is starting.

706
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:58,884
The root vent and LA vent
are going on together.

707
00:52:59,384 --> 00:53:00,510
Dr. Lee.

708
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:02,721
Squeeze the Ambu a few times
and inject the cardiac stimulant.

709
00:53:02,804 --> 00:53:04,139
The stimulant? Okay.

710
00:53:05,807 --> 00:53:07,475
The rhythm is coming back.

711
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:08,894
His body temperature is back up.

712
00:53:09,644 --> 00:53:10,896
I'll start the weaning.

713
00:53:10,979 --> 00:53:12,731
I'll start the ventilation.

714
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,876
Stop the LA vent. What percent are we at?

715
00:53:32,959 --> 00:53:36,504
The LA vent is stopping. We're at 50%.

716
00:53:37,088 --> 00:53:39,299
The root vent is keeping up
with how much is coming out.

717
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:41,343
Is there any air in the heart?

718
00:53:41,426 --> 00:53:42,510
How's the left ventricle moving?

719
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:45,347
The LV wall motion is good,
and I don't see any air.

720
00:53:47,849 --> 00:53:50,268
-Stop the root vent.
-Stopping the root vent.

721
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:52,896
Stop the pump.
I'll check the drainage now.

722
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:55,649
I'll give you the sign
for stopping the pump.

723
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:58,235
One, two, three.

724
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:00,946
You have the tubing line.

725
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:04,783
Adjust the meds
according to his condition.

726
00:54:04,866 --> 00:54:05,992
Okay.

727
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:07,869
Let's focus on controlling bleeds.

728
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:09,329
It'll be hard if he starts bleeding.

729
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:12,374
Don't worry. The biggest enemy
of heart surgery is bleeding.

730
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:18,171
SURGICAL TIMER, CURRENT TIME,
ANESTHESIA TIMER

731
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:30,267
Dr. Han Yihan has added
another successful case

732
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:32,894
to heart transplants. Good job, Yihan.

733
00:54:33,478 --> 00:54:35,188
Dr. Park, that's upsetting.

734
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:37,023
It's not like
Dr. Han did the surgery alone.

735
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:39,859
I know. We're all standing right here.

736
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:41,695
Don't be like that.

737
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:44,239
You guys are the mom and dad of Banseok.

738
00:54:44,739 --> 00:54:46,950
You are the dream team in my heart.

739
00:54:47,033 --> 00:54:49,786
It's thanks to all of you guys too. Right?

740
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:51,413
Yes. Congratulations!

741
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:56,793
What's wrong? The surgery went well…

742
00:54:56,876 --> 00:54:58,128
Hold on.

743
00:54:58,211 --> 00:55:00,046
Dr. Lee. Can you check
the pulmonary artery pressure?

744
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:01,339
Okay.

745
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:04,342
It's 70 over 50. It keeps going up.

746
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:08,513
-It's too high.
-Too high? What's too high?

747
00:55:08,596 --> 00:55:09,806
If the pressure is too high,

748
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:11,850
the right ventricle can't handle it,
and the heart will stop.

749
00:55:11,933 --> 00:55:14,769
BP is 90 over 55. Now it's 85 over 50.

750
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:15,979
Heart rate is 50.

751
00:55:16,688 --> 00:55:18,231
It's dropping.

752
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:19,941
The left and right ventricular pressures
might get reversed.

753
00:55:24,195 --> 00:55:25,447
The right ventricle is impaired.

754
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:27,866
Shoot. What went wrong?

755
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:30,368
Did we give him too much blood?
Or the meds…

756
00:55:30,952 --> 00:55:32,704
What? Is an anesthesiologist
an easy target?

757
00:55:32,787 --> 00:55:34,372
I was precise.

758
00:55:35,373 --> 00:55:37,042
What should we do? Turn the pump on again?

759
00:55:39,252 --> 00:55:40,295
Dang.

760
00:55:50,555 --> 00:55:51,473
Yihan.

761
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:02,609
Turn on the nitric oxide to 40bpm.

762
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:04,736
Bring me a 16-gauge needle.

763
00:56:04,819 --> 00:56:07,280
A 16-gauge?
What are you going to do with that?

764
00:56:07,822 --> 00:56:10,158
I'm going to take blood out
of the pulmonary artery. Hurry.

765
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:12,243
Hey! If something happens to the patient…

766
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:25,256
-Another one.
-Shoot.

767
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:31,429
Hey, Yihan. That's enough.

768
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:32,806
Another one.

769
00:56:39,979 --> 00:56:41,439
This is dangerous.
Something bad could happen!

770
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:47,153
Another one. Hurry!

771
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:49,948
How much are you taking out?
It's already over 400ml!

772
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:52,867
BP is 80 over 35.

773
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:57,038
Now it's 90 over 40. It's going up.

774
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:58,373
Keep reading it to me.

775
00:56:58,957 --> 00:56:59,874
It's 95 over 50.

776
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:03,002
It's 100 over 60.

777
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:04,462
It's 110 over 70.

778
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:07,590
The blood pressure is stabilized.

779
00:57:43,585 --> 00:57:44,794
Let's close him up.

780
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:46,421
Give me Four Zero Prolene.

781
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:16,493
Seokyeong.

782
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:18,244
Yihan.

783
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:22,040
Don't worry. The surgery went well.

784
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:30,173
How's Seokju?

785
00:58:31,382 --> 00:58:33,009
<i>He's in an aseptic area.</i>

786
00:58:33,801 --> 00:58:35,470
<i>Then when can I see him?</i>

787
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:38,598
<i>After an organ transplant,
your immunity is compromised.</i>

788
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:40,892
<i>So you need to avoid any contact
with the outside.</i>

789
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:45,772
I know you want to see him,
but wait until he wakes up.

790
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:48,399
I'll watch over him until then.

791
00:58:51,444 --> 00:58:53,154
Thank you so much, Yihan.

792
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:57,575
Thank you for everything.

793
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:22,308
Yes, sir.

794
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:25,144
The operating room?

795
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:29,023
Yes, sir. I'll be right there.

796
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:51,754
SURGERY IN PROGRESS

797
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:56,050
Where's Director Gu?

798
00:59:56,342 --> 00:59:57,260
He's inside.

799
01:00:16,487 --> 01:00:18,698
You're here. Come inside.

800
01:00:40,011 --> 01:00:42,513
Who is that person?

801
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:44,891
You don't need to know.

802
01:00:46,434 --> 01:00:48,227
He came in three hours ago
from a car accident.

803
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:52,190
He had a bad heart,
so he was waiting for a transplant.

804
01:00:52,732 --> 01:00:54,692
We removed it,
and he's on bypass right now.

805
01:00:57,570 --> 01:00:58,863
Then…

806
01:00:58,946 --> 01:01:00,114
He won't last long.

807
01:01:00,573 --> 01:01:02,283
He needs a transplant right now.

808
01:01:03,242 --> 01:01:04,327
A transplant?

809
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:08,456
We don't have a heart,
so how could we do the surgery?

810
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:10,333
We have a heart.

811
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:30,603
Sir.

812
01:01:33,898 --> 01:01:34,941
That heart…

813
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:38,820
Who does it belong to?

814
01:02:29,036 --> 01:02:31,038
WE THANK NAM KEEAE
FOR HER SPECIAL APPEARANCE

815
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:34,917
<i>Do the surgery for me.</i>

816
01:02:35,001 --> 01:02:35,835
<i>I'll assist you.</i>

817
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:39,046
<i>-Why are you doing this?
-Because it's worth it.</i>

818
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:40,298
<i>Where are you? We're in trouble.</i>

819
01:02:40,381 --> 01:02:42,425
What's going on? Give me 200 joules!

820
01:02:42,508 --> 01:02:44,343
Dr. Han. His heart might explode!

821
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:45,678
He passed away.

822
01:02:46,679 --> 01:02:49,557
<i>I'm just telling you the truth
as revealed from the autopsy.</i>

823
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:50,725
There's no way.

824
01:02:50,808 --> 01:02:52,310
Dr. Han Yihan!

825
01:02:52,393 --> 01:02:53,436
<i>Don't do anything you'll regret.</i>

826
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:55,188
Nothing you do will matter anymore.

827
01:02:55,271 --> 01:02:57,148
I already have plenty of regrets.

828
01:02:57,231 --> 01:02:58,691
<i>Why are you doing this?</i>

829
01:02:58,775 --> 01:03:00,443
<i>There's a patient I must find.</i>

830
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:02,403
<i>Then I'll make you admit</i>

831
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:04,238
that you're a murderer.

832
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:06,365
Who is that patient
that you're going this far…

833
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:09,118
Who is that?

834
01:03:10,703 --> 01:03:12,705
