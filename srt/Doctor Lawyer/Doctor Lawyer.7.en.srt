00:00:00,917 --> 00:00:04,879
THE NAMES OF PEOPLE, INCIDENTS, AND
BACKGROUNDS OF THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:00:05,463 --> 00:00:07,966
EPISODE 7

3
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:10,552
I got a call from Banseok.

4
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:13,221
Your son's heart condition
has deteriorated.

5
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:17,475
If he doesn't get a transplant right away,
it might stop working anytime.

6
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,604
It's an obsidian blade.

7
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:25,191
It's much sharper than it looks.

8
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:30,697
Some doctors still use it as a scalpel
for surgeries that require precision.

9
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:32,991
It's not a metal,

10
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:36,077
so it gets past a metal detector too.

11
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:40,540
ALWAYS REALIZE THE VALUE OF LIFE

12
00:00:58,516 --> 00:00:59,768
All good. You may go in.

13
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:04,105
Now, talk.

14
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:08,610
What do you want to say to me
about the case from six years ago?

15
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,111
Sorry.

16
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:13,448
I didn't want to do this to you.

17
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:15,784
What?

18
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:30,799
Nam Junhwan.

19
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:35,095
If you stab me now, your son will die too.

20
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,305
How did you…

21
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:39,682
Nam Hyukchul.

22
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:41,768
Drop your weapon.

23
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:43,895
Answer me.

24
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:45,605
How did you know about my son?

25
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:47,482
How could I not?

26
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:50,068
He's the only child
between you and your wife.

27
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:53,113
Three years.

28
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:56,616
That's how long it took
for Seokju to find a donor.

29
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:59,661
Do you think
your son could wait that long?

30
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:03,665
I can save

31
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,459
Nam Junhwan.

32
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,130
Nam Hyukchul.

33
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:13,550
Three years?

34
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:15,844
He doesn't have that much time.

35
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,053
-Nam Hyukchul!
-That's why

36
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:19,806
I have to kill you!

37
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:21,516
Nam Hyukchul!

38
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:30,775
Cho Junghyun is coming here.

39
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:35,446
I just got a call from the office.
Cho Junghyun

40
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:36,823
is here to see you.

41
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:39,117
-Why would she come here?
-Why else?

42
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,077
She is trying to save her son.

43
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,204
Just like you.

44
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:49,752
She knows that you killed Park Kitae.

45
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,130
-That's why she's coming.
-Don't try to fool me!

46
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:55,383
She would never come here. Never!

47
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,428
Hyukchul! Don't do it.

48
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,680
Don't do it.

49
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:02,015
If you kill him now,

50
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,309
Junhwan will be in greater danger.

51
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:07,395
You choose.

52
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,524
Whether you'll just sit
and watch your son die

53
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,278
or put your last hope in me.

54
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:41,179
Are you all right?

55
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:49,812
Get up.

56
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,441
Get up, Hyukchul!

57
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:01,950
Prosecutor Geum,
could you please give us a minute?

58
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,434
It's bleeding quite a bit.
Shouldn't you go get it treated?

59
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:31,980
It's okay. I can handle this.

60
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,110
-Can you do this for me?
-Sure.

61
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,469
It was close.

62
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:05,888
If I had gotten there even a second later…

63
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:09,017
But you came just in time.
And thanks to you, I'm fine.

64
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,231
Do you think
Nam Hyukchul will do what we want?

65
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:18,359
We should hope so.

66
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:21,654
What's going on?

67
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:26,034
Why… Why would you come here?

68
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:30,747
I told you,
we should never see each other again.

69
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,041
If people were to find out
about me and Gu Jingi--

70
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:34,334
So it is true.

71
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,504
Director Gu Jingi
ordered you to kill Dr. Park Kitae.

72
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:42,091
Dr. Han knows everything.

73
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:45,970
He knows how I helped Director Gu Jingi
and removed the patient's heart too.

74
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,472
Then you should've just let me.

75
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,725
-You should've just let me kill him.
-Then,

76
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:53,895
the chance for Junhwan's survival
goes down too.

77
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:58,024
I came to save our child.

78
00:05:58,107 --> 00:05:59,233
Just like you.

79
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:06,115
Junhwan won't last much longer like this.

80
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:09,786
-He could die.
-That's…

81
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:14,248
That's why we should ask Gu Jingi
to get him one soon by any means.

82
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,708
Yes, of course.

83
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:17,960
But what if he can't?

84
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,339
We need a backup plan.

85
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:26,344
If it appears that
we might side with Dr. Han,

86
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,764
Director Gu Jingi would be
pressured to get him a heart soon.

87
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,141
If not,

88
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:34,852
Junhwan can get the surgery then.

89
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:37,146
We can choose

90
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,400
whoever offers
a higher chance of saving our child.

91
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:53,204
RECORDS MANAGEMENT ROOM
INTERROGATION ROOM

92
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,376
He needs some time to think.

93
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:03,172
Once you get
your medical license restored,

94
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,465
let's talk again.

95
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:07,176
I'll give it more thought too

96
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:11,347
on whether we would choose surgery
or a heart transplant.

97
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,374
PRISONER TRANSPORT

98
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,544
Before the upcoming murder trial
for Park Kitae,

99
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,214
we need him to confess that
Gu Jingi ordered him to commit murder.

100
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,507
It's going to be a race against time.

101
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,135
Now tell me.

102
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,846
How do you plan
to restore your medical license?

103
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:56,058
I made a deal with Jayden.

104
00:07:56,934 --> 00:08:00,104
While he is in Korea,
I'll be his legal advisor.

105
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:02,356
In return, he'll restore my license.

106
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,650
Isn't it payback
for saving him from drug overdose?

107
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,779
I know you can't answer me.

108
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:12,074
Attorney-client privilege is a basic ethic
that lawyers must follow.

109
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,493
But I can't

110
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,620
cooperate blindly either.

111
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:19,707
So let me meet Jayden.

112
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,585
I'll hear from him directly.

113
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:26,756
<i>Failed?</i>

114
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,759
He failed even though I set up
a perfect opportunity for him?

115
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,345
I'll have to confirm the details,

116
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,722
but Nam Hyukchul returned
to prison for sure.

117
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:38,184
Contact the medical director
and find out what happened.

118
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,895
Since his only child's life
is on the line,

119
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,524
I doubt he would betray me.

120
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:47,693
But if he did, by a chance in a million,

121
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:50,863
I'll need to keep his mouth shut.

122
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:52,114
Understood, sir.

123
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,796
Please enjoy.

124
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:13,094
My goodness, Hyunseong. What a surprise.

125
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:15,721
You said it'll be a casual dinner,
but this place is quite fancy.

126
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,181
I wanted some brownie points

127
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:18,891
and to apologize for what happened.

128
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:22,061
You are still worried about that?
I forgot about it already.

129
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:40,079
Let me go touch up my makeup.

130
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,455
Sure, go ahead.

131
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,118
What a clichéd proposal.

132
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:22,705
It suits Hyunseong.

133
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,773
Don't be nervous.

134
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,613
Are you ready?

135
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:57,657
Play music as soon as she enters.

136
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,497
She is coming.

137
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,395
I apologize for surprising you,

138
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:29,897
but I couldn't wait any longer.

139
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:33,317
We began to meet because of our fathers,

140
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,444
but I want to choose my future

141
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:38,030
of my own volition.

142
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:56,006
Forever,

143
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,801
be my woman.

144
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,388
I will be your man.

145
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:13,524
I never thought I would receive
such a confession today.

146
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,367
It's very touching,

147
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,293
but I can't accept it yet.

148
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,713
-"Yet"?
-Yet.

149
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:40,092
You and I

150
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:42,845
still have a lot to achieve.

151
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:47,933
The man I want to spend
the rest of my life with

152
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:51,437
isn't the Director
of Planning and Coordination.

153
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:57,443
Are you asking me to become
the chairman of the foundation?

154
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:58,611
No.

155
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:01,947
I'm asking you to surpass that position.

156
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:06,285
Surpass even your father.

157
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,599
-It has been a while.
-Director Gu.

158
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:30,476
Are you studying?

159
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,686
It's an SAT course.

160
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,897
Although my departure has been delayed,

161
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,065
I shouldn't get behind any further.

162
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:39,109
I am proud of you.
But you shouldn't overexert yourself.

163
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:40,444
I won't.

164
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,905
Let's take a look.

165
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:51,413
EF is 70%.

166
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,292
As for IVSD…

167
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,002
Oh, no.

168
00:13:58,546 --> 00:13:59,463
It became thicker.

169
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,425
There is SAM too.

170
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:06,720
Don't worry.

171
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:11,308
Let's increase the dose.

172
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,645
I don't see Chief Cho.

173
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:19,108
She is usually here all day long
outside her working hours.

174
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:20,693
Is something up?

175
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:22,361
She said she would come late today.

176
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:25,072
She has to meet up with a friend.

177
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:26,740
I see.

178
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:29,535
A friend.

179
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:52,266
Director Gu.

180
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:54,476
How did you…

181
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:58,898
I realized
that I have been too neglectful.

182
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:02,443
From now on,
I will oversee Junhwan's treatment

183
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,737
and be more attentive.

184
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:08,407
I will have to increase the dose.

185
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:12,661
The heart wall shouldn't thicken
before transplantation.

186
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:16,123
But if he develops a tolerance…

187
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:19,710
What is there to worry about?
He will get a transplant before then.

188
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:32,723
BANSEOK UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

189
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:44,526
Don't you know that
such a thing as a personal life exists?

190
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:48,364
I didn't even work overtime
when I was on Wall Street.

191
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,741
I am sorry. It's a pressing matter.

192
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,619
It looks that way.

193
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:08,717
You are the one who stopped me
from entering the penthouse that day.

194
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,720
Correct. That's my job.

195
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,766
Come to think of it, it's a bit strange.

196
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,727
You stopped me
as if something big was going on.

197
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,605
But once I entered,
you simply stood and watched.

198
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:24,817
It seemed like
you had stopped me for a show.

199
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,407
I don't know what you mean.

200
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,075
I am not fluent in Korean.

201
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,912
I understand.
It's not something you can answer.

202
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:02,604
They are here.

203
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:04,273
Good work.

204
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:06,817
You can go now.

205
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:09,111
Okay.

206
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:14,742
Please sit down.

207
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:21,707
Prosecutor, you wanted to see me.

208
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,627
Yes. I wanted to put an end
to what happened the last time.

209
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:27,171
Put an end?

210
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,631
Didn't we do that the last time?

211
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,258
It was your misunderstanding.

212
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:37,514
Naloxone.

213
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:40,017
I found it in the bedroom.

214
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,395
It's a medicine
that is used for a drug overdose.

215
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:47,524
Please don't misunderstand.

216
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:51,278
I wanted to arrest you with this evidence,

217
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,322
but Mr. Han stopped me.

218
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:56,116
Are you saying you want to investigate me

219
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,993
at this point?

220
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:06,919
No. I don't care
whether you did drugs or not.

221
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:08,879
I want to know

222
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:12,257
with what purpose
you dragged us into this.

223
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:23,393
It's a popular phrase in Korea as well.

224
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,813
It's my favorite saying.

225
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:28,690
The winner takes it all.

226
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:34,113
I will enter into a new contract
with Chairman Gu Jingi.

227
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:38,534
Then I will take more shares if the stock
prices fall for Banseok R and D Center.

228
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,245
If you join forces to reveal

229
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,872
the evil deeds of Chairman Gu Jingi
and Banseok University Medical Center,

230
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,999
it will help me greatly.

231
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:50,420
So using us to make the stock prices drop
is your purpose.

232
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:51,839
Correct.

233
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:55,175
I will secure as many shares as possible
by making the stock prices drop

234
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:59,638
and have Banseok R and D Center
belong to Honours Hand.

235
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,392
Does it make you uncomfortable?

236
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:07,187
Despite being your enemy,
the medical group represents Korea.

237
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,816
So perhaps you don't want
a foreign company to take over.

238
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,442
Not at all.

239
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:14,903
Even if that happens,

240
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:18,490
it will be a price for the sin.

241
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:22,661
Now,

242
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,122
let's hear what your purpose is.

243
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:26,999
Is it revenge

244
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:30,752
on Chairman Gu Jingi
for killing your family?

245
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:40,637
It's what the great president of the US,
Abraham Lincoln once said.

246
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,931
However, I disagree.

247
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,976
Killing the dog won't cure
the physical wound,

248
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,522
but it will cure the emotional wound.

249
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:55,277
Revenge is the best way
of proving oneself.

250
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,911
After a successful deal,
Viking warriors clinked the cups.

251
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:05,662
The moment the cups clinked,

252
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,332
drinks overflew and mixed.

253
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:12,336
So it was a ritual of trust
to prove it was not poisonous.

254
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:29,186
From here on out,

255
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:33,023
you must share all of your plans
about Banseok with me through Mr. Han.

256
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:33,941
Of course.

257
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:37,486
There can't be any secrets among us.

258
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:39,321
Cheers.

259
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,162
Are you expecting someone?

260
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,582
No. I'll go check.

261
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:17,401
You didn't call. What's up?

262
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:20,070
I wanted to see you.
And I have to tell you something too.

263
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:23,198
I can't right now. I'm with some people.

264
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:26,201
Some people? Who? It's pretty late.

265
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,203
My lawyer, Han Yihan,

266
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:32,165
and Prosecutor Geum Seokyeong
that Gu Hyunseong brought the other night.

267
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,626
Why are they here together?

268
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,462
I'll explain later. You should go for now.

269
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:40,132
If they see us out here,
it won't be good for either of us.

270
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:43,427
No. I must see them too.

271
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:49,266
Your lawyer already knows about us.

272
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,728
And I'm also curious why that prosecutor

273
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:54,146
came back again.

274
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:56,523
-Yuna.
-I'm disappointed.

275
00:21:56,857 --> 00:22:00,193
Don't tell me you didn't think
I would be able to handle this.

276
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:04,031
Don't worry.

277
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,908
I lived my whole life
as a daughter of a diplomat.

278
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,494
Thanks to that,
I'm good at dealing with people.

279
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:13,290
And this is important to me too.

280
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:16,126
I can't let you always be my middle man.

281
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,201
Nice to meet you.

282
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:52,746
I'm Lim Yuna,
the director of Banseok R and D Center.

283
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:56,041
I'm Prosecutor Geum Seokyeong.

284
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,585
And you…

285
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,254
We've met before, right?

286
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:02,589
Nice to see you again.

287
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:05,509
What brings you here?

288
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:09,429
I needed to discuss the new drug
the center is developing.

289
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:13,642
It must be important
that you came to his house

290
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:14,726
at this late hour.

291
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,771
I don't like my work piling up.

292
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:22,109
I could ask you the same thing.
I would like to know why you're here.

293
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:27,781
I'm sorry, but I can't tell you
the details of my work.

294
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:29,199
I'm here on duty.

295
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:32,661
Then let me ask you a different question.

296
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,669
What's your relationship

297
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:43,004
with Mr. Han?

298
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:50,971
Why? Is your relationship
strictly professional as well?

299
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:57,894
We were once engaged.

300
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:02,941
But now,

301
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:05,652
our relationship is purely professional.

302
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:14,619
All right.
Why don't we end our meeting here?

303
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,164
Now that we've cleared up
our misunderstanding.

304
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:20,250
-Sure.
-I'll call you.

305
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:22,669
To thank you for helping me that day.

306
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:25,672
Let me treat you to a meal
when you're free.

307
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,716
There's something I want to discuss too.

308
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,384
Okay.

309
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:42,856
What's wrong?

310
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:47,194
-Did something happen?
-No. Nothing happened.

311
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:49,779
I'll get going too.

312
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,992
And we should steer clear
of each other for the time being.

313
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:55,785
Why is that?

314
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:59,414
I need time to sort out my thoughts.

315
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:02,250
Time to evaluate…

316
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:05,879
what I really want.

317
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:09,549
Sure. You should do that.

318
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:27,859
What? You openly proposed to Director Lim
at a restaurant on the dock?

319
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:28,944
Yes.

320
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:32,155
The jazz quartet and the proposal ring
were perfect.

321
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:34,658
What was the problem?

322
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,202
Was getting on one knee too much?

323
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:39,829
Come on. That was so awful.

324
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:41,915
You're not some knight who lost a war.

325
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:44,709
You should've proposed, not begged.
Did you do something wrong?

326
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,336
Then what should I have done?

327
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:50,257
You shouldn't do
what you want for the proposal.

328
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:52,467
You must do what she wants.

329
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:55,804
Exactly.
How can I find out what she wants?

330
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:57,597
Gosh.

331
00:25:58,181 --> 00:26:01,768
I shouldn't know the answer to that.
It's not my proposal.

332
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:04,938
Besides, if you don't know what she wants,

333
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:06,648
it's too soon to propose.

334
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:09,526
Gosh.

335
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:19,327
If I surpass my father,
will she really say yes then?

336
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:21,871
-Your father?
-Yes.

337
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:23,498
That's what she said.

338
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,418
She told me to surpass my father.

339
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:33,425
Then you must work hard.

340
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:38,805
Rest up.

341
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,853
Goodness. He's so dense.

342
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:48,440
If she actually liked him,
the place wouldn't matter.

343
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:50,483
She would've even said yes here.

344
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:55,155
Try it in the elevator.
She would've been thrilled.

345
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:02,954
Thank you.

346
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:07,083
I'll need to work a lot with Jayden
going forward.

347
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,835
This way, everything will be in the open.

348
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:13,381
Don't thank me. It's part of my job too.

349
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,345
Earlier,

350
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:22,682
why did you tell her that?

351
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:32,901
Because it's true.
There's no reason to hide it.

352
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:03,181
She needs time to think?

353
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:18,196
NAM HYUKCHUL
MEDICAL DEVICE ENTREPRENEUR

354
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:20,323
<i>He needs some time to think.</i>

355
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:23,618
Once you get
your medical license restored,

356
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:25,161
let's talk again.

357
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:27,706
<i>I'll give it more thought too</i>

358

CHO JUNGHYUN'S EX-HUSBAND,
MURDERED PARK KITAE

359
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:32,210
<i>on whether we would choose surgery
or a heart transplant.</i>

360
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:33,128
GU HYUNSEONG, LEE DOHYUNG
PARK KITAE, CHO JUNGHYUN

361
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:43,680
"You are subpoenaed to appear in court

362
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:46,975

malpractice suit against Banseok…"

363
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:55,817
Ms. Pyo, do I have to appear in court?

364
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,111
No. You don't have to comply.

365
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:00,655
Right. This is distorting the truth.

366
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,450
He dedicated his entire life
to saving lives.

367
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:06,286
What is this? Attempted murder?
So ridiculous. Seriously.

368
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:10,373
-Can't we sue them for slander?
-I'll look into that.

369
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:11,666
That's that.

370
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,918
What will you do about Choi Yosub?

371
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,962
We will advise him to resign--

372
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:18,298
Gosh, no.

373
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:21,176
He caused a lot of damage
to my reputation and the hospital.

374
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:23,636
He's not getting out of this that easily.

375
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,597
-Don't you agree?
-Totally.

376
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,557
That traitor stabbed
a fellow doctor in the back.

377
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,933
We must make an example out of him

378
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:31,436
to show the others
that traitors will rot in misery.

379
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:34,022
I understand.

-No idea.

383
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:47,160
OPERATING ROOM ANNOUNCEMENT

384
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,332
-What are you doing? What did I do?
-We received a tip

385
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:55,251
that you violated
the Narcotics Control Act.

386
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:56,753
Who made that ridiculous report?

387
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:01,633
-It's a misunderstanding. I didn't do--
-Sure.

388
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,301
I got it.

389
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:05,887
We'll search your office thoroughly.

390
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,847
And if we don't find anything,
we'll leave.

391
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,768
We need to check the hospital's laptop.
Unlock it, please.

392
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,901
I'm so nervous. I hope it went through.

393
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:21,528
It couldn't have gotten omitted or…

394
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:26,449
-Come on. Open it.
-Okay.

395
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,620
-I'll check it now.
-Okay.

396
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:48,388
Hey, this isn't fake. Right?

397
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:50,932
This is a real medical license, right?

398
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:53,142
Do you think
they would send us a fake one?

399
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:55,270
This is the seal
of the Minister of Health and Welfare.

400
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:58,189
Jayden kept his promise.

401
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:01,276
Given what he accomplished,
it won't be a bad thing to join hands.

402
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:04,320
Hey, that's not important right now.
He's a doctor again!

403
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:07,699
Yes!

404
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:09,909
Yihan, we should get a new sign.

405
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,579
The first floor is for Dr. Han.
The second floor, Lawyer Han.

406
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:14,664
Let's make it super cool!

407
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:20,044
What?
We haven't even opened the hospital yet.

408
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,171
Is that our first patient?

409
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:27,302
Congratulations.

410
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:34,017
Come on in. We've been waiting…

411
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:52,744
Is this Mr. Han Yihan's law office?

412
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:55,079
Yes, it is.

413
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:58,249
What is a beautiful lady like you
doing at a humble place like this?

414
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,340
How can I help you?

415
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:08,301
-You're here.
-Hey.

416
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:12,513
Nice to meet you.
I'm Ban Soohee, a reporter for MBS.

417
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:14,474
Excuse me.

418
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:18,853
Hey, are you taking a shower?

419
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:21,522
You used up half of the bottle
for a handshake.

420
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:23,691
Nice to meet you.

421
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:27,487
I'm the chief clerk at New-Hope Law Office

422
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:29,197
and the head nurse
at New-Hope Medicine Clinic.

423
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,741
My name is Kang Daewoong.

424
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:36,829
Okay. I hope we get along, Daewoong.

425
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:39,499
Gosh. Yes.

426
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,793
I want nothing more than that.

427
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:45,505
Soohee, don't smile at him
with that pretty face of yours.

428
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:48,174
Guys like him
mistake kindness for affection.

429
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:50,343
-When did I…
-Let's go.

430
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:53,304
Dry your hands before you come up.

431
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:56,849
I won't dry them.

432
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,770
This is what you asked for.

433
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:02,522
Thank you.

434
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:04,315
You weren't lying, right?

435
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:07,860
You said you had a huge scoop
about Banseok and Chairman Gu Jingi.

436
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:09,153
You bet.

437
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,036
News agencies assign reporters

438
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,830
for a promising presidential candidate
like Lim Taemoon.

439
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:22,750
A reporter with a managerial title
at my agency is following him.

440
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:25,628
As you can see from the file,
nothing is out of the ordinary.

441
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:27,922
He's a clean politician
which is hard to see these days.

442
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:30,049
Clean politicians.

443
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:32,510
Aren't they some kind of mythical figures?

444
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:35,430
That's why I looked into him on my own.
And I found something interesting.

445
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:46,941
It's medication for blood pressure.
And cyclosporine.

446
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:48,818
They are immunosuppressants.

447
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:50,653
So you two figured it out right away.

448
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:52,989
Not a lot of people take
this kind of medication, right?

449
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:55,199
Right.

450
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:59,912
Patients who received
transplant surgery have to take it

451
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,040
for the rest of their lives.

452
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:06,961
Where did you find this?

453
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:09,130
From the recycling bin
in front of his house.

454
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:46,626
I didn't expect much.
But I hit the jackpot.

455
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:50,046
If a promising presidential candidate
secretly received transplant surgery,

456
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:52,256
that would be enough
to get people talking.

457
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,384
Of course, I won't stop there.

458
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:58,721
So tell me

459
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,307
about this huge scoop you have for me.

460
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,693
Gu Jingi

461
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:16,531
ordered Nam Hyukchul to kill Park Kitae.

462
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:21,119
Chairman Gu got someone to commit murder?

463
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:22,453
Yes.

464
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:25,873
He even tried to kill me recently
in the interrogation room

465
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:27,708
at a prosecutors' office, but he failed.

466
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,044
Gosh.

467
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:33,297
If this is true,
the whole world will be in a frenzy.

468
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:35,633
Do you have evidence
to support your claim?

469
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:37,760
Nam Hyukchul's son, Nam Junhwan,

470
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:40,555
is in Banseokwon
for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

471
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,432
If I perform the surgery and save his son,

472
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:47,186
he promised
to confess everything in court.

473
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,772
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy?

474
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:51,858
That sounds like a difficult surgery.

475
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,153
Not a lot of doctors in Korea
performed this procedure.

476
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:58,656
And it will be even hard for me to succeed

477
00:35:58,739 --> 00:35:59,991
without help from another surgeon.

478
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:03,744
Then is there a surgeon who will help?

479
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:06,247
You don't have to worry about that.

480
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,541
I have a surgeon I can trust.

481
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:11,210
An emergency patient!

482
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,797
-What's wrong?
-Anaphylaxis.

483
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,258
Give him antihistamine
and prepare to intubate.

484
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:18,509
Okay.

485
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:20,094
Doctor, we need to perform CPR.

486
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,973
Dr. Choi, hurry.

487
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:34,609
Why do I have to wait three hours
just to get my blood drawn?

488
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:36,360
I'm sorry.
I have a lot of emergency patients.

489
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:39,780
It will sting a bit.

490
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,202
You're doing that on purpose, right?

491
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:46,078
Press on it.

492
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:48,206
I'm going to write a post
about this online.

493
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:50,166
Sir, stop moving.

494
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:51,959
-Stay still.
-Where am I?

495
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,503
-Don't move, sir.
-What are you doing?

496
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:57,048
You're trying to mug me, aren't you?

497
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,843
-What are you doing?
-We need help over here!

498
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:19,612
Are you out of your mind?

499
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:20,947
How dare you doze off in the OR?

500
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:22,865
Must I wait for you to cut?

501
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:26,911
You can't even do your job.
How dare you put your nose in my business?

502
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:29,330
Go face the wall with your arms up.

503
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:32,667
I don't need an incompetent surgeon
who can't even cut.

504
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:37,213
Go!

505
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:46,013
Turn around.

506
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:51,686
Seriously.

507
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,421
Please.

508
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:22,008
Please.

509
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:29,807
People often say

510
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:33,269
evil deeds come at a price.

511
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:35,396
But you see,

512
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:39,525
sometimes, good deeds
come at a greater price.

513
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:41,444
Just like you.

514
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:45,114
I'll give you a chance

515
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:48,117
to set your good deed right.

516
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:50,536
Return to your previous role.

517
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:53,873
I'll make you an associate professor.

518
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:56,959
In three years, you'll be a professor.

519
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,919
After that,

520
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:03,924
you will be the Head
of Cardiothoracic Surgery at Banseok.

521
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:07,386
Then what about Gil Soyeon?

522
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:09,889
Don't worry about her.

523
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:13,809
She'll be compensated like the ruling.

524
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,021
It's a gesture of my generosity

525
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:20,691
that I respect your good deed
and forgive your mistake.

526
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:25,196
But I need you
to promise one thing for me.

527
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:29,492
Promise that
you will never associate with Han Yihan

528
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:31,786
in whatever circumstances.

529
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:35,456
Think carefully.

530
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:37,833
This is your last…

531
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:42,630
This really is

532
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:45,841
your last chance.

533
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,605
What? Nam Hyukchul
threatened him with a knife?

534
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:00,815
Yes.

535
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:04,527
He hid a knife made of obsidian
under the bandages on his hand.

536
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:06,821
And he tried to kill Mr. Han with that.

537
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:10,699
Go on. What happened?

538
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:12,952
His neck was wounded a bit.

539
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:14,495
But it's not serious.

540
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:18,833
I should talk
to the deputy chief prosecutor, right?

541
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,460
We should ask the police
to investigate to find out

542
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:22,837
how he got his hands on--

543
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,297
No. Don't do it.

544
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,801
Will Mr. Han be pressing charges?

545
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:30,928
No.

546
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:34,056
He said he'd let it go if Nam Hyukchul

547
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:35,933
hires him as his attorney.

548
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:38,018
That's good.

549
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:41,397
If he says he's okay,
there's no reason to dig into it.

550
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:44,608
A suspect tried to kill his attorney

551
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:47,653
in the interrogation room.
If this gets out,

552
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:51,574
it won't be just me and you in a difficult
position. The chief prosecutor too.

553
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:54,785
What's wrong?

554
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:57,288
You don't seem like the person
I know you to be.

555
00:40:57,997 --> 00:40:59,582
Back in the day,

556
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:02,376
you would tell me to report it
as it happened.

557
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:06,714
That's the person I liked and respected.

558
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:13,304
I'll do what you want me to do this time.
In return,

559
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:17,308
let me be the prosecutor
for Nam Hyukchul's sentencing.

560
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:20,352
Okay. Do that.

561
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:50,549
What's wrong?

562
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:52,510
You're slower than usual.

563
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:55,513
I'm considering
taking a different route this time.

564
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:58,933
If I play with the same opening
and the same defense,

565
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:00,392
it's boring.

566
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:05,731
Even if it's fun, if you don't win,

567
00:42:05,814 --> 00:42:06,732
it's meaningless.

568
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:08,234
I agree.

569
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:10,778
I'm not interested in lessons

570
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:12,488
learned from the losses.

571
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:19,662
When did the queen…

572
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:23,749
-Was this your plan all along?
-No.

573
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:25,334
I just moved around freely.

574
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:29,630
After all, that's the queen's charm.

575
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:35,261
Upon injecting a group of two-year-old
mice with the new drug, A582,

576
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:39,014
their exchange with other entities and
activity level increased by 32%.

577
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:40,432
That's impressive.

578
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:43,477
A two-year-old mouse
is equivalent to an elderly human.

579
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:45,563
It's as though they've gotten younger.

580
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:47,940
The difficulty with finding
a cure for Alzheimer's

581
00:42:48,023 --> 00:42:50,609
is that even if you develop a drug,
the brain can't absorb it.

582
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:53,279
But A582
penetrates the blood-brain barrier.

583
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:56,699
What's more surprising is how effective
it is in developing the frontal lobe.

584
00:42:56,782 --> 00:42:58,909
If you look at the MRIs
of the patients in the trial,

585
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:01,245
all of their frontal lobes
are revitalized.

586
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:03,581
This one drug can cure Alzheimer's

587
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:04,832
and frontal lobe dementia.

588
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:06,875
What's the period of administration?

589
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:09,753
The center's internal standard is 14 days.

590
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:11,547
For 14 days?

591
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:13,340
Let's try it again.

592
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:15,843
Increase the entities and the time frame.

593
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:17,011
Pardon?

594
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:21,682
Fourteen days isn't short
compared to other institutions.

595
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:23,726
Is that necessary?

596
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:25,060
That's domestic standard.

597
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:28,022
It's not long enough
to receive FDA approval.

598
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:29,273
The same goes for Europe.

599
00:43:30,232 --> 00:43:33,360
Plus, we'll be administering it
to more patients in Phase Three,

600
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:34,570
so we must be careful.

601
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:37,615
Yes, ma'am.

602
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:40,534
What's wrong?

603
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,579
I'm sorry,

604
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:45,664
but can we speak in private?

605
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:52,046
We have a deadline.

606
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:53,964
"A deadline"?

607
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:56,091
For what?

608
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:59,845
For Chairman Gu's
Minister of Health and Welfare hearing.

609
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:03,223
We have to pass the rapid approval review
before then.

610
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:06,894
So you don't want to do
a thorough clinical trial?

611
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:08,979
No, it's not that.

612
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:11,732
-I'm saying we've done enough.
-I'm not satisfied.

613
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:16,111
Do as I say. I'm in charge of this place.

614
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:24,703
She wants another clinical trial?

615
00:44:25,287 --> 00:44:27,748
-For double the period?
-Yes.

616
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:29,458
I tried to explain it to her,

617
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:32,461
but she says
she'd take responsibility for it.

618
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:35,881
Do what she wants.

619
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:38,884
-Would that be okay?
-Yes.

620
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:43,138
She'll figure out that
she'll have to follow my plan soon enough.

621
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:44,390
Yes, sir.

622
00:44:52,564 --> 00:44:54,858
The key
to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy surgery

623
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:59,029
is to cut just enough
of the thickened heart muscles.

624
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:02,741
If you cut too little,
the surgery is meaningless.

625
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:06,370
But if you cut too much,
the heart will be ripped.

626
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:08,914
Right. That's why it's hard.

627
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:12,292
It's hard enough to get the scalpel
in the aorta,

628
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:15,879
but you have to cut the muscle
and take it out.

629
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:22,261
What? You lost the knife,
so you couldn't do anything?

630
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:23,971
Are you serious?

631
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:25,556
I had no choice.

632
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,600
It's not like I could kill him
with my bare hands.

633
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:35,274
How could you lose the knife
I wrapped in your bandages?

634
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:37,443
Be honest with me.

635
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:40,195
Do you think Director Gu Jingi
would accept this?

636
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:41,905
Do you think he'd believe you?

637
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:49,121
If you're considering changing your mind,
wake up.

638
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:51,999
Your son…

639
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:54,793
Director Gu Jingi can kill him
whenever he wants.

640
00:45:55,794 --> 00:45:57,504
The same goes for you.

641
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:03,844
HOPEFUL CORRECTIONS

642
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:32,080
That's an additional 0.8g.
It's a total of 6.2g.

643
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:37,461
-Show me more of the inside.
-Okay.

644
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:11,954
I think I cut off too much.

645
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:15,958
I need a first assistant
in order to handle an emergent situation.

646
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:17,376
Don't worry.

647
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:20,170
Dr. Choi is going to assist you
with Nam Junhwan's surgery.

648
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:28,554
CHOI YOSUB

649
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:34,852
<i>Your call cannot be connected.
Please leave your message…</i>

650
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:43,694
Seokyeong!

651
00:47:45,487 --> 00:47:47,823
-Daewoong.
-How long has it been?

652
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:49,408
Have you been well?

653
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:51,618
I'm tearing up.

654
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:53,871
Have you been well too?

655
00:47:54,496 --> 00:47:58,250
I'm sorry. I know you took care
of Seokju for a long time,

656
00:47:58,333 --> 00:47:59,459
but I couldn't call you.

657
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:01,378
What are you saying?

658
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:03,380
I'm grateful you came.

659
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:06,592
-You're here.
-Yes.

660
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:13,140
Were you practicing for the surgery?

661
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:15,893
Yes. I was practicing with a pig's heart.

662
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:18,812
I need to do this,
so I don't lose my touch.

663
00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:21,440
Yihan, you should go up with Seokyeong.

664
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:22,733
I'll clean up.

665
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,776
-Thanks.
-No problem.

666
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:27,529
Let's go up.

667
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:46,131
What's wrong? Do you not have an appetite?

668
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:49,593
You said you wanted to meet in private,

669
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:52,179
so I asked them to stay open late for us.

670
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:57,309
I want Dr. Han Yihan
to do Junhwan's surgery.

671
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:01,188
I'm grateful for your consideration,

672
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:03,732
but I can't wait any longer.

673
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:06,318
I'd like you to stop administering
the new drug…

674
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:17,454
I'll prepare the next course.

675
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:25,545
We stuffed the heart of a suckling pig
marinated in yogurt

676
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,506
and baked it in the oven
with pancetta and rosemary on it.

677
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:29,299
It's a stuffed pork heart.

678
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:31,802
Thank you. We don't need any more food.

679
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,096
You may be excused.

680
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:35,222
Yes, sir.

681
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,523
When I did my first heart surgery,

682
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:47,192
you were with me.

683
00:49:47,275 --> 00:49:50,445
Yes. I couldn't believe
it was your first surgery.

684
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:52,447
It was a perfect success.

685
00:49:53,031 --> 00:49:54,533
In order to succeed,

686
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:58,370
I practiced with pigs' hearts.

687
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:02,958
It wasn't once or twice.
I tried it dozens of times.

688
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:04,835
Do you know what I realized then?

689
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:10,716
There isn't much difference
between a human heart and a pig's heart.

690
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:14,803
Once I came to realize it, I was surprised

691
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:16,930
by how I wasn't nervous anymore.

692
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:21,309
After that, whenever a critical situation
arose during surgery,

693
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:23,103
I told myself,

694
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:26,231
"This isn't a human. This is just a pig.

695
00:50:26,314 --> 00:50:28,025
This is a pig's heart."

696
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:31,987
What's interesting
is that when I did that, my patient lived.

697
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:34,489
Because bold decisions
that are hard to make on humans

698
00:50:35,323 --> 00:50:37,159
are possible on pigs.

699
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:39,661
Sir…

700
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:42,205
I'll put Junhwan on ECMO
to get him higher on the transplant list.

701
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:46,418
That way, if a heart comes up
in our hospital, he can get a transplant.

702
00:50:46,501 --> 00:50:48,920
But what if there are no hearts?

703
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:50,297
We have to make it happen.

704
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:53,300
There's a suitable candidate too.

705
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:56,553
A man in his 20s
who came in from a motorcycle accident.

706
00:50:56,762 --> 00:51:00,223
Luckily, he's an organ donor.

707
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:03,518
There is some possibility
that he'll recover,

708
00:51:04,686 --> 00:51:06,730
but I can take measures
for Junhwan's sake.

709
00:51:07,814 --> 00:51:11,193
What do you mean by taking measures?

710
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:17,449
I'm sorry.

711
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:19,284
Think of him as a pig.

712
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:22,079
Five years ago and even now.

713
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:26,833
If you want to save Junhwan,

714
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:29,127
don't have useless ideas.

715
00:51:30,128 --> 00:51:31,505
Otherwise,

716
00:51:37,844 --> 00:51:39,429
someone precious to you…

717
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:46,186
will end up on the dinner table.

718
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:00,575
A reporter came to see me.

719
00:52:01,326 --> 00:52:03,328
She said she found this
in the recycling bin

720
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:05,872
at Lim Taemoon's home.

721
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:10,585
They're immunosuppressants.

722
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:15,966
It's medication taken by those
who have had organ transplants.

723
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:17,801
What?

724
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:24,307
Lim Taemoon,
former Minister of Foreign Affairs.

725
00:52:24,891 --> 00:52:26,768
Five years ago,
when he was the ambassador to the US,

726
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:31,314
he helped Banseok Foundation
acquire a general hospital in California.

727
00:52:36,778 --> 00:52:37,988
Then does it mean

728
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:40,991
this person took Seokju's heart?

729
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:45,996
Calm down. We can't know for sure yet.

730
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:50,709
I'll find out more about Lim Taemoon
through the reporter.

731
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:54,296
Seokyeong,
you should focus on Baek Kangho.

732
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:57,090
Okay.

733
00:52:57,674 --> 00:52:58,925
I'll look into him.

734
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:01,511
Is it tomorrow?

735
00:53:02,095 --> 00:53:04,347
The day you're meeting Jayden
and Chairman Gu Jingi.

736
00:53:04,931 --> 00:53:06,933
-Yes.
-Will you be okay?

737
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:11,730
Honestly, I don't think
I'd be able to hold myself back.

738
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:14,524
I feel the same way.

739
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:18,069
I'm not sure…

740
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:20,780
how I will face him yet.

741
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:36,338
Return the 300 billion won investment
as shares of the R and D Center…

742
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:40,967
The period being ten business days
after the hearing

743
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,262
for the Minister of Health and Welfare…

744
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:47,974
The higher the price of shares,
the fewer shares we must give them.

745
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:50,810
The higher the stock prices are,
the more advantageous it is for us.

746
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:52,646
Something's bothering me.

747
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:57,025
If the new Alzheimer's drug gets approved,
our stocks will skyrocket.

748
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:58,860
Are you trying to take a gamble?

749
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:00,737
That bothered me too,

750
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:03,949
so I had a law firm that specializes
in foreign companies review it.

751
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:06,785
They said as long as the stocks go up,
it's a non-issue.

752
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:11,081
Gosh.

753
00:54:14,542 --> 00:54:16,086

You and Chairman Gu
will meet again at last.

757
00:54:23,593 --> 00:54:24,928
I'm getting excited for you.

758
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:27,681
Are you going to punch him
when you see him?

759
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:31,268
Do whatever you want.

760
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:33,103
Punch him or curse at him.

761
00:54:34,145 --> 00:54:35,605
I don't care.

762
00:54:38,733 --> 00:54:39,985
Thank you.

763
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:43,238
I feel better thanks to you.

764
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:54,499
You know that
even if you used to work here,

765
00:54:54,582 --> 00:54:56,042
in principle, you must file a request

766
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:59,004
to see the materials that have been
transferred to the storage department.

767
00:54:59,337 --> 00:55:00,797
Of course.

768
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:04,259
I'm only asking you for this favor
since I was in charge of the case.

769
00:55:04,342 --> 00:55:06,261
If it was any other case,
I wouldn't have come.

770
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:09,014
I'm sure you have your reasons,
Prosecutor Geum.

771
00:55:09,097 --> 00:55:11,141
But next time,
please file a request first.

772
00:55:11,224 --> 00:55:12,434
I will.

Hello.

776
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:27,032
-Prosecutor Geum?
-Yes.

777
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:31,119
The Criminal Department One material
from when you worked here is all here.

778
00:55:31,202 --> 00:55:34,289
Thank you.
I'll return it as soon as I'm done.

779
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:35,332

GUKKWANG GANG ABDUCTION AND MURDER CASE

783
00:56:25,006 --> 00:56:27,801
They're late.
We've already waited ten minutes.

784
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:31,679
They're here.

785
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:57,038
We've been waiting for you.

786
00:56:57,455 --> 00:56:59,165
I'm sorry for being late.

787
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:02,293
The thought of two people
who have bad blood meeting

788
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:04,003
made me a bit nervous.

789
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:05,463
We don't have bad blood.

790
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:09,050
It was resolved
according to law and reason.

791
00:57:10,635 --> 00:57:11,553
Don't you agree?

792
00:57:12,178 --> 00:57:15,014
I received the gift you sent me.

793
00:57:16,558 --> 00:57:17,434
"Gift"?

794
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:19,936
I don't know what you're talking about.

795
00:57:20,645 --> 00:57:22,605
I never sent you a gift.

796
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:26,276
Then I should return it

797
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:29,362
since I don't think it was meant for me.

798
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:40,415
I bet there was a lot of blood

799
00:57:41,499 --> 00:57:43,168
when you took out Seokju's heart.

800
00:57:46,045 --> 00:57:48,548
It's your turn to bleed now.

801
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:49,924
Hey!

802
00:57:58,349 --> 00:57:59,726
This is the gift I received.

803
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:02,353
What is this?

804
00:58:02,937 --> 00:58:05,940
I knew it. I can never predict his moves.

805
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:08,026
Hey, you punk.
Move that hand in this instance!

806
00:58:08,109 --> 00:58:09,110
Stay still!

807
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:13,990
-Cut me.
-Father.

808
00:58:14,365 --> 00:58:17,785
If your revenge was to end like this,
you wouldn't have waited five years.

809
00:58:21,122 --> 00:58:22,415
Do it.

810
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:25,418
If you can.

811
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:28,421
You're right.

812
00:58:29,756 --> 00:58:31,674
I waited years for my revenge.

813
00:58:33,092 --> 00:58:34,469
It'd be futile to end it like this.

814
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:41,684
But the thing with revenge

815
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:45,188
is that it's futile when it ends.

816
00:59:47,208 --> 00:59:48,501
Father, are you okay?

817
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:50,295
I'm just returning what I got.

818
00:59:50,378 --> 00:59:52,297
I'll make you
the director of the hospital.

819
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:54,257
Don't marry Gu Hyunseong.

820
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:56,676
Why not? Do you love me?

821
00:59:56,759 --> 00:59:58,052
<i>I'll let you drive fast.</i>

822
00:59:58,136 --> 00:59:59,804
<i>More! Step on it!</i>

823
01:00:00,388 --> 01:00:01,681
<i>Empty your head!</i>

824
01:00:02,348 --> 01:00:04,642
We'll trust you with our son's surgery.

825
01:00:04,726 --> 01:00:08,521
Are you planning on
stealing another patient's heart again?

826
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:10,898
What can I help you with?

827
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:14,319
<i>Can we trust him with something
as important as this?</i>

828
01:00:15,361 --> 01:00:17,238
Didn't you join forces with Han Yihan?

829
01:00:17,822 --> 01:00:19,657
I don't have any loyalties to Han Yihan.

830
01:00:30,501 --> 01:00:32,503
