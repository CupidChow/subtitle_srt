1
00:00:00,834 --> 00:00:04,879
THE NAMES OF PEOPLE, INCIDENTS, AND
BACKGROUNDS OF THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:05,797
PARK KITAE

3
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:21,354
I'm Han Yihan,
a lawyer at New-Hope Law Office.

4
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:22,814
Who is this?

5
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:25,233
Well… There's a problem.

6
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,283
What happened?

7
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,410
Well… There was an accident.

8
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:49,632
<i>Go ahead</i>

9
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,427
if you want to get killed without a trace.

10
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:57,515
Getting rid of you here isn't even hard.

11
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,786
How? How did this happen?

12
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:20,246
He was attacked by an inmate.

13
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:24,918
Right here. He got stabbed in the neck
with a broken toothbrush.

14
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:27,170
His neck was beyond damaged
with cuts in his trachea.

15
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,339
There was nothing I could do to save him.

16
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:32,300
We don't have enough facilities or people,

17
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,178
so we couldn't have proper surgery.

18
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:37,972
Who's the inmate that attacked him?

19
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:39,849
Well…

20
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:41,601
He's a death-row convict.

21
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:44,270
-A death-row convict?
-Yes.

22
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:46,064
The name is Nam Hyukchul.

23
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:49,234
He was sentenced to death
and got imprisoned six years ago.

24
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:50,777
Nam Hyukchul?

25
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:53,238
Can we meet him now?

26
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:55,865
No, he was extremely agitated,

27
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:57,283
so we drugged him to sleep.

28
00:01:57,992 --> 00:02:00,870
He'll wake up tomorrow at the earliest.

29
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:01,788
I'll have him transferred

30
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:04,082
to the jail in Seoul Central
District Prosecutors' Office.

31
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:05,834
What?

32
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:09,003
You can just summon him as needed.
Why do you have to go so far?

33
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:12,924
I'm too worried to leave a murder suspect
with people who have no control over him.

34
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:14,717
Get him ready for the transfer.

35
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:19,097
Let me report this back to the warden.

36
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:20,890
I'll meet the warden with you.
I'll tell him myself.

37
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,103
Then please give us a moment.

38
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:26,688
Go ahead and make a call.

39
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:44,289
Do not touch him.

40
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,875
We'll examine him properly at the NFS.

41
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:49,711
Right.

42
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:52,297
He needs an autopsy.

43
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,140
Prosecutor Geum, come with me.

44
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:03,558
The warden agreed to see you.

45
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:18,615
<i>Yihan, thank you</i>

46
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:20,950
for saving someone who betrayed you.

47
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,661
If you're grateful,
don't betray me ever again.

48
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:26,456
<i>I'll be on your side this time.</i>

49
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,041
<i>I'm serious.</i>

50
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:32,795
<i>Then you have to forgive me a little.
Okay?</i>

51
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:00,657
EPISODE 4

52
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,493
Park Kitae died?

53
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:06,120
He was going to be released tomorrow. Why?

54
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:09,332
It was Gu Jingi.

55
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:12,293
I should have expected him to do this.

56
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:16,339
He cut open Seokju's chest
and took his heart

57
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:18,424
although he was alive.

58
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:22,762
I was too careless. It's my mistake.

59
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:28,017
You may all fall in danger too. So--

60
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,936
Stop going on with that nonsense.

61
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,855
-Hey, you.
-I'm right, aren't I?

62
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:35,984
If you knew this would happen,
you shouldn't be a doctor or a lawyer.

63
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,402
You should be a fortune-teller.

64
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:39,988
Someone else killed that man.
Why do you have to feel guilty?

65
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,864
Am I wrong?

66
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,368
I'm a loyal woman.

67
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,954
Banseokwon is the best hospital in Korea,

68
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:51,749
but no one wanted to do my dad's surgery
and tried to send him to another hospital.

69
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,210
But you did it and saved him.

70
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:57,630
I quit my job as a reporter
to repay your kindness.

71
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,174
If you act like this,
how can I not get frustrated?

72
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,467
She's right.

73
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:05,596
If it hadn't been for you,
I would've been some gangster's minion.

74
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,307
Don't say that.

75
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,358
Right.

76
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:20,528
If I stop now,

77
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,822
it means Gu Jingi will have his way.

78
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,368
Let's make him regret

79
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:30,204
being a doctor

80
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:32,957
who has no regard for human life.

81
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:39,464
<i>Dr. Park, a cardiothoracic surgeon</i>

82
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:41,716
<i>on trial for manslaughter
and professional negligence,</i>

83
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:45,178
<i>was killed by a death-row convict
who was in the same detention center.</i>

84
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:47,138
<i>Mr. Nam was a medical device manufacturer</i>

85
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:49,432
<i>who was sentenced to death six years ago</i>

86
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:52,935
<i>for killing a doctor at Banseok University
Medical Center with a broken bottle</i>

87
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,979
<i>whom he served
at an adult entertainment venue.</i>

88
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:58,524
<i>Most death-row convicts are
held in detention centers,</i>

89
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,526
<i>where unconvicted inmates are confined,</i>

90
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,195
<i>until the day of their execution.</i>

91
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:04,072
<i>That's why Mr. Nam, a death-row convict,</i>

92
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:07,033
<i>was imprisoned in the same center
as the victim, Dr. Park.</i>

93
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,868
A death-row convict who is unconvited?

94
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:12,747
What an interesting nation.

95
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:16,501
<i>Let us hear from Attorney Han Yihan,
a medical lawyer of the victim,</i>

96
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:17,960
<i>-on the details of the case.</i>
-Han Yihan.

97
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:20,588
A lawyer who specializes
in medical malpractice.

98
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,924
<i>My name is Han Yihan,
the victim's attorney.</i>

99
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:25,426
<i>The deceased was
falsely accused of a medical crime</i>

100
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,678
<i>and got confined in a detention center.</i>

101
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:31,182
<i>As an attorney,
I will hold the prosecution</i>

102
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:33,643
<i>and Banseok University Medical Center
accountable for his death.</i>

103
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:37,855
<i>In order to evade responsibility
for the death of a patient,</i>

104
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:40,400
<i>Banseok University Medical Center blamed
all faults to the individual doctor.</i>

105
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:43,111
<i>This led to the forceful arrest
by the prosecution,</i>

106
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:46,572
<i>which became the foundation
for the victim's death.</i>

107
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:49,033
How dare you?

108
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,576
<i>When his autopsy is over,</i>

109
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,745
<i>we will file a complaint
with Banseok University Medical Center</i>

110
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:56,290
<i>and expose the truth
behind the victim's horrendous death</i>

111
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,000
<i>to hold them accountable.</i>

112
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:00,962
<i>Also, we'll represent
all victims of malpractice</i>

113
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:03,965
<i>from Banseok University Medical Center
pro bono.</i>

114
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:06,509
<i>I promise we will fight for them
until the end.</i>

115
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,345
<i>That was Attorney Han Yihan.</i>

116
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,764
<i>He asserts that
the deceased victim is innocent,</i>

117
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:15,560
<i>whereas the prosecution pressed him
regarding the medical crime investigation.</i>

118
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:18,062
Back then,

119
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,274
I should have listened to you.

120
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,777
It's belated,
but we should straighten this out, right?

121
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,029
Before it's too late.

122
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,115
Yes, I'll do that.

123
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,371
Good work.

124
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,417
Soohee.

125
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,253
I think you came off as a little strong.

126
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,546
How so?

127
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:44,589
It's a fact that Nam Hyukchul killed

128
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:47,049
a doctor at Banseok University
Medical Center six years ago

129
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,885
and Park Kitae in confinement.

130
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,178
I only delivered facts.

131
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,597
There's something called
de-facto defamation.

132
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,265
That's like a medal for reporters.

133
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,685
Will you defend me if I get sued?

134
00:07:58,603 --> 00:07:59,645
Of course.

135
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,439
Thanks a lot, Soohee.

136
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:04,734
You've made follow-up reports on the case
since the last trial

137
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,903
and even prepared
a separate segment for us.

138
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,863
It was an exclusive story.
I should thank you.

139
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:10,573
What's your plan now?

140
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:14,327
They were openly denounced,
so they won't just sit back.

141
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,299
Thank you very much
for visiting Banseokwon.

142
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:29,842
Banseokwon aims

143
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:33,095
to have our members feel like
they aren't at a hospital.

144
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,974
You'll be able to enjoy many perks
that come with your membership.

145
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,644
You two are a perfect fit at our center.

146
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,272
We have many different facilities
on each floor.

147
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:46,442
Our fitness center is equipped
with the newest machines

148
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,946
and the most qualified trainers
to help you stay in perfect health.

149
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:50,863
Not bad.

150
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,740
Should we continue? Let's go.

151
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:55,076
We reflected the fields and greens

152
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:57,245
of many famous golf clubs
in Korea and overseas.

153
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:58,913
Give it a try.

154
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,460
And our luxurious anti-aging center

155
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,629
will lift up the body and hearts
of our exhausted members.

156
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:12,885
From the eighth floor and up are
our hotel and the penthouse.

157
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:16,055
There's no problem for our overseas VIPs
to come by and enjoy their stay.

158
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:18,808
Among many VIPs, Banseokwon aims to become

159
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:22,228
the most luxurious anti-aging
and healthcare center

160
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:23,521
for the top one percent.

161
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:27,024
-Sounds great. I love it.
-Thank you.

162
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,526
The chief of the anti-aging center.

163
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,279
My name is Yoo Gayeon. Nice to meet you.

164
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:34,365
Allow me to serve you
with all of my heart. Let us go.

165
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,499
It's an honor to have you.

166
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,625
Which floor are you headed to?

167
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:47,712
Honey, isn't there a floor
only for the VIPs?

168
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:50,256
Right, may we see that place too?

169
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:51,215
I'm sorry.

170
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:55,219
That floor is
only for our special members.

171
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:59,557
You two are still young.
You'll find a chance to become one.

172
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,129
Why are you here?

173
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,799
His bereaved family wants me
to observe the autopsy.

174
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,886
They said it'd crush them
to come and watch this.

175
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:38,971
Why do you need to observe it?

176
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:42,058
He died, so the court
will dismiss the indictment.

177
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,143
Then aren't you done with your job
as an attorney?

178
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,437
The criminal trial is over.

179
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,731
But the civil suit against Banseok
University Medical Center begins now.

180
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,942
And I got things to look over
with the prosecution.

181
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:06,666
Thank you for your time.

182
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:09,418
You were a witness on scene
at the time of his death,

183
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,337
so I wanted to hear your opinion.

184
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,256
Don't worry about it.
I'm more at ease to come here and do this

185
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,633
instead of the prosecution.

186
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:24,558
Current time, 3:32 p.m.
The autopsy begins now.

187
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:26,018
Silent prayers.

188
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:42,827
Right there. Another photo.

189
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:57,800
Scalpel.

190
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:19,321
Yes, well, the cause of his death is

191
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,574
excessive bleeding
due to a severed carotid artery

192
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:23,409
and hematogenic shock.

193
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,036
I couldn't find any underlying diseases.

194
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,539
Is it that easy to cut
one's carotid artery?

195
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:30,791
The culprit stabbed him violently,

196
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,002
so one of the hits
must have gone deep into the artery.

197
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,884
I was on night duty yesterday.

198
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,553
They were almost finished taking showers.

199
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:46,599
The hallway became noisy,
then people came running to the infirmary.

200
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:52,396
Lay him on his back!

201
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:54,982
Ketamine. Now!

202
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:58,986
Hurry!

203
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:02,281
Mr. Park, can you hear me?

204
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:05,576
Don't speak. It'll go worse!

205
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,498
More gauze! Hurry!

206
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,629
This was not medical malpractice.

207
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:20,716
I really did my best,
but he died before I could do anything.

208
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,053
Did he say anything before he died?

209
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:26,472
No.

210
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:30,351
His neck was ragged.
How could he say anything?

211
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,403
When can I receive Kitae's belongings

212
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,447
which the prosecution took?

213
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,115
After we're done with the procedures.

214
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,325
Please hurry.

215
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:48,828
The deceased is
no longer the accused, but the victim.

216
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,621
His possessions are no longer evidence.

217
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:54,083
Let's talk.

218
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,679
We can talk about personal matters now.

219
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,640
We're no longer the prosecutor
and the attorney in a trial.

220
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:11,767
Follow me.

221
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:38,544
Making investments and lobbying.

222
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:43,299
Without these two wheels,
nothing ever happens in the US.

223
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:46,510
Honours Hand will personally invest
and lobby to help Banseok

224
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:47,970
establish the corporate body

225
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:50,931
and have everything approved by the FDA.

226
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,935
From now on, my wife, who is in the US,
and Director Gu Hyunseong will be

227
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:58,230
in charge of everything
for our launch in the US.

228
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:02,943
I hope you look after each other,
help out, and get along.

229
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,029
I look forward to your help.

230
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,406
Sure.

231
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,617
Will you get the meal ready?

232
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:17,458
Let me cut the steak.

233
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,710
Let me have it. I'll do that.

234
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:33,974
What's the best way of serving meat?

235
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,771
Preparing enough meat
to satisfy everyone's appetite.

236
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:42,900
And if possible,
in the parts each person likes.

237
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,949
Director Gu and Mr. Gu.

238
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:52,576
You two will accumulate
an amazing amount of wealth

239
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,162
thanks to Banseok's successful launch
in the US.

240
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:58,999
You two deserve striploin,
the part with the richest flavor.

241
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:07,383
Ambassador Im,
you must keep your heart strong

242
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,843
to stay healthy
through the presidential election.

243
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,931
So you should take
the tenderloin with minimal fat.

244
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,441
Yuna, you should have both.

245
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:32,074
I'm still not sure what you're after.

246
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:47,297
Please, dig in.

247
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:52,302
I don't think you have enough meat.
I think you made a mistake.

248
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:53,971
This is enough for me.

249
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:57,641
Only the best parts
of tenderloin and striploin are here.

250
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,228
You and I want different things.

251
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,547
Each to our own.

252
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:31,967
We aren't in a relationship
to pour one and make a toast.

253
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:54,573
Thanks.

254
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:58,702
I became overly emotional
and almost had an innocent man convicted

255
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,121
while losing the real criminal.

256
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,248
Thank you for preventing that.

257
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:04,875
I mean it.

258
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:08,879
I only did my job as a lawyer.

259
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:11,882
Yes, you're a lawyer.

260
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:16,512
Then let me ask.
Why did you become a lawyer?

261
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:20,849
You admitted to killing Seokju
and got off with probation.

262
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,559
Then you should live quietly in regret.

263
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:26,396
How dare you
shamelessly become a medical lawyer?

264
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,528
Because it makes money.

265
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:36,865
Director Gu Jingi is stopping me
from getting my license restored.

266
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:40,202
So I only found a way to make a living

267
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:42,204
by doing something I'm good at.

268
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:49,044
Are you really that man I always knew?

269
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:55,968
When you showed up in court,

270
00:18:56,051 --> 00:19:00,139
I was surprised and angry at first,
but I became a little hopeful.

271
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:03,475
I thought, "Was there another truth
he couldn't reveal back then?"

272
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,394
"Is that why he became a lawyer?"

273
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:07,771
Did you become a medical lawsuit expert

274
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,273
and defend the medical malpractice case

275
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:10,983
from Banseok University Medical Center
to reveal the truth--

276
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:13,610
Do you really hope
that there's a different truth?

277
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:18,615
If there was a truth I couldn't reveal,

278
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:22,661
and if that's why I was framed for
this medical crime,

279
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,204
then the prosecution

280
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,832
and the Medical Crime Department
will be responsible.

281
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:31,128
The prosecutor who pressed me
and had me framed five years ago is

282
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,923
the current head
of the Medical Crime Department,

283
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:36,675
Baek Kangho.

284
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:40,304
And before you blame me,

285
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,431
we need to have Kitae vindicated.

286
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:45,684
Kitae's murderer, Nam Hyukchul.

287
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:49,771
He was famous in the medical device field
for persistent and dirty sales tactics.

288
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,773
He also had a connection
at Banseok University Medical Center.

289
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,318
What do you mean, a connection?

290
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:55,777
In Banseokwon,

291
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:01,950
the nurse who took part
in Seokju's operation

292
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:03,243
was Nam Hyukchul's wife.

293
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:06,538
She's the head of the nursing department
at Banseok University Medical Center now.

294
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,336
So investigate
all his relationships properly.

295
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,755
He once ran
a successful medical equipment business.

296
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:19,509
There must be a reason
why he ended up killing two doctors.

297
00:20:55,754 --> 00:21:00,592
I wonder how long Jayden, that punk,
has known about my heart.

298
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,720
Are you the one who told him?

299
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,013
Certainly not, sir.

300
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:09,768
Someone must've leaked
your medical records in the US.

301
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:12,688
Honours Hand has enough resources
to obtain such information.

302
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,273
His attitude is so…

303
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:17,150
He is very arrogant.

304
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:19,444
He is in charge of investing and lobbying,

305
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,697
but he is merely just playing
with other people's money.

306
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:25,826
Hyunseong, why don't you go
and spend some time with Yuna?

307
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:27,703
Show her around the garden too.

308
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:29,371
Will do.

309
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:43,427
You have a long way to go
until the presidential election.

310
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,595
We will provide you with full support

311
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,140
so that nothing interferes
with your health.

312
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:50,851
Thank you for your kind words.

313
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:55,480
But I have no intention of trusting
a machine with my heart.

314
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:57,524
What do you mean by that?

315
00:21:57,607 --> 00:22:00,444
Please don't use a robot for my surgery,

316
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:03,280
and ask Hyunseong to perform it himself.

317
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:06,283
Otherwise, I won't do my surgery
at Banseok University Medical Center.

318
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:08,744
I understand your concern,

319
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:12,706
but V-Rock allows you to perform
the surgery without opening the chest.

320
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:15,000
Then the recovery will be much faster--

321
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:19,755
So, are you asking me
to trust my life with that robot,

322
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,840
which is still in its trial phase?

323
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:26,553
You're not using my heart
as a test case, are you?

324
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,013
No way.

325
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:30,766
What? Is it going to be a problem?

326
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:35,312
Even before the development of the robot,

327
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:38,482
Hyunseong was in charge
of all the VIP patients at Banseokwon.

328
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:40,233
I heard his skills are remarkable.

329
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:43,236
It's no problem at all.
Please don't worry.

330
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:47,699
I'll make sure that my son
is the one who performs

331
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,159
your heart surgery.

332
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:00,253
Yes.

333
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:10,847
Oh, I'm sorry.

334
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:14,726
I got it prescribed for medical use.
But I needed it to relax a little.

335
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:16,770
Why did you put it out? What a waste.

336
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:18,980
It’s hard to get a hold of it here.

337
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:23,068
Why do you look so surprised?

338
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,653
You said it was for medical use.

339
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,488
I'm not that close-minded.

340
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,116
It seems like it.

341
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:30,700
Thanks to you, I had a good time earlier.

342
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:34,329
The men here act unnecessarily subservient

343
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,456
to the elders with money and power.

344
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,666
But you didn't do that.

345
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:42,087
Is Director Gu Hyunseong one of those men?

346
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:44,881
I'm not sure.

347
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:49,761
Do you wish that's the case?

348
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,764
Yuna.

349
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,019
I guess he was worried…

350
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,605
that I might be with you.

351
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:02,357
Go relieve his anxiety.

352
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:04,151
You can answer my question next time.

353
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:06,403
Do I have to answer it?

354
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,405
Use your imagination

355
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:10,115
until we meet again.

356
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:16,621
Hyunseong. Is the discussion over?

357
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:18,290
Yes, kind of.

358
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:20,625
Were you alone with him all along?

359
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,502
I just ran into him after taking a walk.

360
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:24,838
I was about to go inside.

361
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:26,214
Were you looking for me?

362
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:32,888
Actually, there is something
I really want to give to you today.

363
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:42,063
What is it? By any chance…

364
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,733
It's okay. Just open it. It's not a ring.

365
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:56,786
You still have a few more days to go,

366
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,580
but it's your director's
inauguration gift.

367
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:00,624
Do you like it?

368
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:02,542
It's so beautiful.

369
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:09,049
I'll wear them
to the inauguration ceremony.

370
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:10,467
Thank you.

371
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:12,344
Sure.

372
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:20,393
Shall we go inside?

373
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,909
-Because of that man…
-Goodness.

374
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:37,160
It's so unfair.

375
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:40,580
-That's what I'm talking about.
-What?

376
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:42,040
My goodness.

377
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:43,833
-Get in line.
-Seriously.

378
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:46,127
-Oh, my.
-What happened to you?

379
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,963
They killed my mom.

380
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:50,340
My mom's life was hanging by a thread.

381
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:53,176
She died because they neglected her
and didn't give her treatment.

382
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,344
This is nonsense.

383
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:56,721
But based on
the hospitalization records you provided,

384
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:59,724
the patient refused
life-sustaining treatment.

385
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,269
I guess you didn't agree to that?

386
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:05,188
-Yes, I agreed.
-I see.

387
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:09,985
So both you and the patient agreed
to refuse life-sustaining treatment,

388
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:13,488
but you want to sue the hospital

389
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,907
for just letting her die?

390
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:19,494
But even if we had agreed,

391
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:20,829
if someone is dying,

392
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:24,165
shouldn't the doctors
save the patient's life first?

393
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,375
Am I wrong about that?

394
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,336
What nonsense…

395
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,463
What? What did you just say?

396
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:32,757
What? Nonsense?

397
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:35,427
-No.
-Is this a joke to you?

398
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:38,263
What on earth is it that you do?
What ridiculous place is this?

399
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:42,392
Look here. Check this out.

400
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:44,519
Gosh, take a proper look!

401
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:50,942
It looks like a scar
from having an appendectomy.

402
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,570
It's medical malpractice, right?
I'm going to sue them.

403
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:56,323
Pardon? That's quite normal

404
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:58,491
-for appendectomy.
-"Normal"?

405
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:01,202
But I can't even wear a bikini
in the summer because of this scar!

406
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,664
Gosh, why are you doing this?

407
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:06,082
Take a closer look!

408
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:08,793
The scar is so large.
Why can't I sue them?

409
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:13,590
Okay, I got it. Please have a seat.

410
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:23,808
Please tell me how you were harmed
by Banseok University Medical Center.

411
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:33,443
Banseok University Medical Center
installed a tapping device in my ear.

412
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:35,528
They're monitoring me.

413
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:45,997
That must be very uncomfortable.

414
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:54,339
Okay, drink this, everyone.

415
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,424
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

416
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:57,425
You're welcome.

417
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:01,638
I was so scared earlier.

418
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:05,809
Why did you have to announce on TV
that we'll represent people pro bono?

419
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:08,853
Stop complaining
if you don't have a death wish.

420
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:10,980
It was my day off after a week.

421
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:16,277
Do you know how to torment someone
the most with the least amount of effort?

422
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:20,240
You sue them.

423
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:23,410
Whether they’ve done wrong or not,
just sue them with anything.

424
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:25,328
Even if they didn't do anything wrong?

425
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:28,665
Getting sued itself is stressful.

426
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:33,586
On top of it, there are
back-to-back cases that involve Banseok.

427
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:36,548
If all these lawsuits are
filed against them all at once,

428
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:37,924
wouldn't it be quite stressful?

429
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:39,634
Of course, among these,

430
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:42,554
there must be victims
who really have been wronged.

431
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:51,229
My child's voice doesn't come out well

432
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:56,151
ever since she got her surgery
at Banseok University Medical Center.

433
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:02,198
Your daughter had

434
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:04,701
a mediastinal tumor resection last fall.

435
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:07,370
The location of the tumor…

436
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:11,791
was on the left side of the heart.

437
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:13,918
The size was five centimeters.

438
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:16,880
It must've been a difficult surgery.

439
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:20,049
What did the hospital say
about the results?

440
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:22,719
They said they did their best,

441
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:25,388
and based on moral principles,
they would waive the hospital fees.

442
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:28,892
This is a terrible situation,

443
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:32,854
but it wouldn't have been easy
to cleanly remove a tumor of this size.

444
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:35,315
Even if the surgeon had made a mistake,

445
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:39,152
criminal proceedings would be difficult.
A civil claim wouldn't have--

446
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:40,987
I wasn't fully anesthetized.

447
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:50,580
-What did you say?
-Soyeon, your throat…

448
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:53,500
It’s okay. I want to tell him myself.

449
00:29:57,837 --> 00:30:00,715
I went inside the operating room
and was put under anesthesia.

450
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,510
I lost consciousness for a short while

451
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:06,137
and woke up again soon afterward. But…

452
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:11,142
I couldn't move my body.

453
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:15,188
<i>Don't do it! I am awake!</i>

454
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,441
<i>Stop! Don't do it! Don't!</i>

455
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:25,198
I shouted as hard as I could to say that

456
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,367
I hadn't been anesthetized.

457
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:30,954
I asked them to stop many times,

458
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:33,373
but no one could hear me.

459
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:35,750
The pain

460
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:39,796
and the feeling
of metal ripping through my flesh

461
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:44,300
are so fresh
that I can't get them out of my head.

462
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,970
Mr. Han.

463
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:49,806
Please watch this.

464
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:55,270
<i>That's right, I have a dream</i>

465
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:58,982
<i>I believe in that dream</i>

466
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:04,696
<i>Watch me</i>

467
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:11,202
<i>A cold wall that is the fate
Stands tall before me</i>

468
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:14,122
<i>But I can face it</i>

469
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:17,458
-<i>With confidence</i>
-Since childhood, she loved to sing.

470
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:19,419
Despite her young age,

471
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:22,213
she trained for seven years
to become a singer.

472
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:25,174
Last year, she became
a candidate for a debut group.

473
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,302
But she lost her voice.

474
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:31,472
Mom, why are you crying again?

475
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:34,893
You are making me cry.

476
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:44,611

00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:48,489
<i>Operating surgeon, Gu Hyunseong.</i>

479
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:51,618
OPERATION RECORD

480
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:57,665
ANESTHESIOLOGIST: LEE DOHYUNG

481
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:07,216
I know it will be painful for you,
but please give me more details.

482
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:10,345
Who operated?

483
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:14,057
What did they talk about
during the operation?

484
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:16,684
Please tell me everything.

485
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:22,023
CHIEF PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE

486
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,027
Come on in.

487
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:32,200
Didn't you go home?

488
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:35,745
Well… We will be interrogating
Nam Hyukchul soon.

489
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:37,205
I came to check the materials.

490
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:38,373
Why the rush?

491
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:40,708
It won't require much work
since he is on death row.

492
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:42,794
I had other reasons.

493
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:45,088
Can we have a chat for a second?

494
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,301
Sure. Take a seat.

495
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:54,055
-Would you like coffee?
-Yes, please.

496
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,559
What is this about?

497
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,898
I went to observe
Park Kitae's autopsy yesterday

498
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:06,484
and ran into Han Yihan.

499
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:10,113
I wanted him to tell me
why he showed up as a lawyer

500
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:12,740
even if he only gave me excuses,
so I had a drink with him.

501
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:16,744
He said something strange.

502
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:18,913
What did he say?

503
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:22,709
"What if there is
another truth to Seokju's trial?"

504
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:26,713
"What if I was framed
for medical malpractice?"

505
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:28,881
"What will you do then?"

506
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:36,055
What a shameless idiot.
He still goes around spouting nonsense.

507
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,684
We should have put him behind bars
no matter what.

508
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:43,187
-"No matter what"?
-Yes. No matter what.

509
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:46,399
We should have appealed
and taken things to the Supreme Court

510
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:47,817
so that he would have been punished.

511
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:53,865
The nurse who participated
in the operation

512
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:56,075
became the head of the nursing department
at Banseok University Medical Center.

513
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:58,911
And her ex-husband is

514
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:01,164
Nam Hyukchul, the death-row convict
who killed Park Kitae.

515
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:02,415
What about it?

516
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:05,209
I won't know for sure
unless I look into Nam Hyukchul,

517
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:06,878
but I don't think it's a coincidence.

518
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:10,131
Park Kitae was also a doctor
who operated on Seokju.

519
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:13,051
The man who killed him
is related to Banseok.

520
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:15,970
Don't have preconceived ideas
about the victim.

521
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:17,847
You will make another mistake.

522
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:20,683
I won't.

523
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:24,353
I can't make a mistake.

524
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:34,030
<i>What do you mean?</i>

525
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:36,699
Why can't we use V-Rock
for the ambassador's surgery?

526
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,619
Ambassador Im
doesn't want to be operated by a robot.

527
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:41,537
What a stubborn man.

528
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:44,165
He watched the demonstration,
but he still doesn't trust the machine.

529
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,212
What should we do?

530
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:51,714
In the past few years,
I used V-Rock for all major surgeries.

531
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:54,175
We need to find someone

532
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:56,969
who will operate instead.

533
00:34:57,845 --> 00:35:01,599
I will take care of it,
so just focus on the hospital.

534
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:05,895
Make sure
Han Yihan doesn't stir anything up.

535
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,232
Understood.

536
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:15,071
<i>I killed him because it was unfair!</i>

537
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:18,908
<i>The doctors who took money from me
didn't even receive punishment.</i>

538
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:20,535
<i>They live a comfortable life.</i>

539
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:23,871
But I will rot away in this place.

540
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,707
<i>Did you know the victim, Park Kitae?</i>

541
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:28,459
Yes.

542
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:32,380
I often paid for the get-together
of the cardiothoracic surgery department.

543
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:35,299
Do you know what's funny?

544
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:38,594
He didn't recognize me
until the moment he got stabbed.

545
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:42,348
Doctors are too high and mighty
to remember someone like me.

546
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:46,519
They only thought of me as a wallet.

547
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:50,731
<i>After years of being an exemplary inmate,</i>

548
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:52,900
<i>you killed a man for such a small reason.</i>

549
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:59,866
Am I supposed to believe that nonsense?

550
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:07,081
<i>Your ex-wife, Cho Junghyun,</i>

551
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,834
became the head of the nursing department.

552
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:13,671
She is now in charge of over 1,000 nurses.

553
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:17,133
Isn't it an overly shocking promotion
for someone

554
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,468
whose husband killed a doctor
at the same hospital?

555
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:20,720
Hey!

556
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:23,222
<i>What does it have to do with me?</i>

557
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:26,267
I don't care what happened
to the witch who filed for divorce

558
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,685
as soon as her husband went down.

559
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:30,188
It has nothing to do with me.

560
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:33,191
Gosh.

561
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,276
If she has nothing to do with you,

562
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:37,695
why are you getting so worked up?

563
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:40,281
Stop acting and give me the real reason.

564
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:42,325
Why did you kill Park Kitae?

565
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:53,085
<i>I told you.</i>

566
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:55,463
A longer sentence won't affect me,
a death-row convict.

567
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,924
I killed him
since it felt unfair to rot here alone.

568
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:00,468
Perhaps…

569
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:03,387
you want me to make up a story
about receiving an order.

570
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:06,515
Is it what you want?

571
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,434
Is it?

572
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:18,903
<i>This is giving me a headache.</i>

573
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:20,738
We can't offer anything

574
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:23,324
to a man who will be in prison for life.
This is driving me crazy.

575
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:25,785
Here is the information on the suspect.

576
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:29,705
He and Cho Junghyun
got divorced six years ago.

577
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:33,084
He has a son.
I guess he broke ties with his father

578
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:34,502
because he hasn't visited once.

579
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:36,254
He doesn't have pocket money either.

580
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:39,215
There isn't anything unusual
about his bank transactions.

581
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:42,009
Hold on. If it happened six years ago,

582
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:44,720
she divorced him
as soon as he killed a man.

583
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,014
It's understandable.

584
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:51,018
She probably didn't want to live
as a murderer's wife.

585
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:54,230
Dig deeper into his family
and acquaintances.

586
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:55,815
Check the visitors

587
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:58,067
and mails he received during imprisonment.

588
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,402
Okay.

589
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:06,200
I think things will get freakishly tiring.

590
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:09,662
"Freakishly"?
I am surprised you use that word.

591
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:11,247
Don't underestimate me.

592
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:14,250
I know all the trendy phrases.
"Whatever, go watch TV."

593
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:17,295
Don't be ridiculous. Go watch TV.

594
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:20,673
What? Where are you going? Wait for me.

595
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:23,884
BANSEOK UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

596
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:28,097
You will sue us for all of these cases.

597
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:31,434
You know most of them will be dismissed.

598
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,810
Why are you doing this?

599
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:36,647
The department of justice
will be the judge.

600
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,774
Please excuse me.

601
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:44,030
100 LAWSUITS FILED AGAINST BANSEOK
UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER IN A MONTH

602
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:47,325
This article has been released.

603
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:51,537
100 LAWSUITS FILED AGAINST BANSEOK
UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER IN A MONTH

604
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:54,290
Banseok won't even bat an eye.

605
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:57,251
We can have that article
taken down in a day.

606
00:38:58,085 --> 00:38:59,670
Go ahead and try.

607
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:02,757
And…

608
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:06,010
I want to take Park Kitae's belongings.
Where are they?

609
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:10,806
How would I know
about such trivial matters?

610
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:13,309
I am sure they are in his office.

611
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,144
I see.

612
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:18,356
In that case, I will collect them myself.

613
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:21,859
You will be busy
going over all of these materials.

614
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,207
Ms. Kang Miok, did you sleep well?

615
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:40,544
I couldn't sleep a wink
because I was nauseous.

616
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:43,798
My goodness. You struggled all night long.

617
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,176
I will ask them to lower the dose.

618
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:50,096
But here is what makes us worried.

619
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:52,515
Because you haven't eaten
breakfast and lunch much,

620
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:53,974
your heart is under a bit of strain.

621
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:58,145
So promise me you will finish your dinner.

622
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,398
I will try to eat

623
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:02,358
because you're so nice.

624
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:04,693
Thank you. Then see you in the evening.

625
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:10,449
Ms. Park Jongsoon.
How are you feeling today?

626
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:13,661
Hey. There's blood.

627
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:15,496
There's blood?

628
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:19,208
-Let me take a look.
-No, I'm not talking about me.

629
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:20,626
Look at your nose.

630
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,378
You have a nosebleed.

631
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,382
I do?

632
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:33,889
I'm all right. We're at a hospital.
And I'm a doctor.

633
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:35,099
I'll be okay.

634
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:37,810
Can you get me some tissue?

635
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:42,148
A nosebleed in front of a patient?

636
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,610
Should I take more health supplements?

637
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:49,238
Drink this, doctor.

638
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:50,948
Gosh. Thank you…

639
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:52,908
Good work.

640
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:54,702
Yihan?

641
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,495
Yihan!

642
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:58,414
How long has it been?

643
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:09,842
This place hasn't changed
even after five years.

644
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:11,635
Do you still pull all-nighters?

645
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,804
Gosh, Yihan.

646
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:16,098
You know things don't change here
just like in the military.

647
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:19,310
These are Kitae's personal belongings.

648
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:22,813
The prosecutor took most of his stuff
during the investigation.

649
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:24,732
So this is all that's left.

650
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:27,943
Thanks for keeping them.

651
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:29,111
Don't mention it.

652
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:33,032
You and Kitae both
were members of the medical staff here.

653
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:38,746
Right. Those were some tough days.

654
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:42,333
How are things here these days?

655
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:44,210
-You're a fellow now, right?
-Yes.

656
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,754
People call me a fellow,
but in real life, I'm like a slave.

657
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:48,547
This is my third year.

658
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:52,801
Third year? Aren't things going
to get better for you now?

659
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:55,304
One can dream.
You saw me with the nosebleed earlier.

660
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:56,764
This is all because of you.

661
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:57,848
When I was an intern,

662
00:41:57,932 --> 00:42:00,935
you said, "You're the only genius
to follow in my footsteps."

663
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:03,562
I wouldn't have joined CS
if you didn't sweet-talk me.

664
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:07,107
Don't you remember other professors tried
to scout me to their departments?

665
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:10,277
Sorry for leaving you alone here.

666
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:13,447
Gosh, Yihan. I was just joking.

667
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:17,284
But I'm glad to see you're doing better.

668
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:19,286
A lawyer after a doctor?

669
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:23,374
I knew it. Some people are bound
to be successful no matter what.

670
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:26,418
But I hope

671
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:30,881
you will come back to medicine someday.

672
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,759
Once everything gets sorted out,

673
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:36,762
I hope you will be
a cardiothoracic surgeon

674
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:39,348
at a hospital even if it's not here.

675
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,602
Okay. Thank you.

676
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:46,689
Let's go. I'll carry this for you.

677
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:56,323
You must be the surgical first assistant
for a lot of surgeries these days.

678
00:42:56,615 --> 00:42:58,742
Not a lot. But only for major ones.

679
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:02,454
After Kitae's recent incident,

680
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:06,250
Dr. Gu Hyunseong and I are
the only cardiothoracic surgeons here.

681
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:09,878
So we usually bring in residents
for most of our surgeries.

682
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:14,258
Yosub, do you know
a patient named Gil Soyeon

683
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:15,718
by any chance?

684
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:18,053
Gil Soyeon?

685
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:20,848
Yes. Gu Hyunseong

686
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:24,560
performed the mediastinal tumor resection
on her.

687
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:27,771
But the damaged laryngeal nerve
changed her voice.

688
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:30,941
And I'm handling her lawsuit.

689
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:35,029
Then you came back here today because…

690
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:46,415
You…

691
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:49,835
How dare you show up here?

692
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:51,045
Hello, sir.

693
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:53,964
I stopped by
to pick up Kitae's belongings.

694
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:54,923
Is there a problem?

695
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:57,468
Your presence in this hospital
is the problem.

696
00:43:57,551 --> 00:43:58,719
Take his things and get out.

697
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:01,764
Who's your ghost these days?

698
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:07,186
What?

699
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:10,439
Gu Jingi must have gotten you a new one.

700
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:12,524
A ghost to replace me.

701
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:15,653
-You…
-Gu Hyunseong.

702
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:24,286
Thanks for inviting me last night.
It was fun.

703
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:26,163
Sure.

704
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:27,706
What brings you here?

705
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:30,542
I have to talk to your father
about the repayment of the investment.

706
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:33,295
-I see. Why don't we go to his office?
-No.

707
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:37,633
I will discuss this matter
only with your father.

708
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,304
You don't have any deciding power.

709
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,435
And who's this?

710
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:54,316
You're Han Yihan. The lawyer.
I saw your interview.

711
00:44:55,317 --> 00:44:57,319
-And you are?
-Jayden Lee.

712
00:44:57,653 --> 00:44:59,488
A business partner
who invested in Banseok.

713
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:02,783
You must be busy preparing
the lawsuits against the hospital.

714
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:04,618
What brings you here?

715
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:07,371
Don't tell me there's a new problem
I should be aware of.

716
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:09,164
It's not new.

717
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:12,292
There's been a problem for a long time.

718
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:15,337
A very big problem.

719
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:20,175
Did I miss something?

720
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:22,553
Thanks for the heads-up.

721
00:45:23,637 --> 00:45:25,806
I'll say hello if we ever meet again.
Goodbye now.

722
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:39,403
Look into that lawyer's background.

723
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:41,613
Why?

724
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:42,823
I need to find out

725
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:46,577
if there's a problem I'm not aware of.

726
00:45:51,623 --> 00:45:52,624
Thanks.

727
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:55,669
I must have taken too much of your time.
You seem busy.

728
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:58,005
-Bye.
-Bye.

729
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:04,386
I guess you have too much time
on your hands.

730
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:07,097
You have time to chitchat with a visitor.

731
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:08,390
No.

732
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:10,559
Don't you know he's suing our hospital?

733
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:14,062
Don't meet him in private.

734
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:17,024
Don't even call him. Understood?

735
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:18,817
Yes, sir.

736
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:33,957
You want to be repaid with the shares

737
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:37,377
of our research and development center,
equivalent to half of the investment

738
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:38,295
you made?

739
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:41,006
Based on the stock price
from five years ago

740
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:43,383
which was when the investment was made.

741
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:47,387
Since we were able
to overcome a crisis with your help,

742
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:48,847
to show good faith for our partner,

743
00:46:49,431 --> 00:46:52,226
I can partially repay the investment
with the shares. However,

744
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:53,602
half is too much.

745
00:46:53,685 --> 00:46:55,604
The price has gone up
compared to five years ago.

746
00:46:57,397 --> 00:46:58,732
Does that mean…

747
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,487
you won't keep your promise?

748
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:06,323
I'm saying that
we need to make a few adjustments.

749
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:10,536
Our legal team reviewed
the investment contract.

750
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:13,872
They found grounds that
the contract could be considered unfair.

751
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:15,582
Your point is?

752
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:17,459
The level of awareness in Korea

753
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,378
has gone up a lot.

754
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:21,547
With the economic crisis in the past
and the Lone Star incident,

755
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:23,382
people have struggled a lot.

756
00:47:23,465 --> 00:47:26,760
So they disapprove of losing
our national assets to foreign companies.

757
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:30,722
How do you think things will pan out
if the lawsuit regarding the contract

758
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:32,599
were to be held in Korea?

759
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:36,687
I don't think you'll get a better offer
than the one I'm making.

760
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:44,152
I'm disappointed.

761
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:46,655
I believed that you would be

762
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:49,324
a reasonable businessman,
unlike the others.

763
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:52,411
How could you use such a petty trick
to break the rule?

764
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:54,371
I apologize if I offended you.

765
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:57,499
I must consider the political side
of things in Korea too.

766
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:03,171
Fine. Then let's make some new rules.

767
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:04,756
We'll make it more interesting.

768
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:08,802
Exactly ten days
after your nomination hearing

769
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:10,512
for the Minister of Health and Welfare,

770
00:48:11,346 --> 00:48:13,682
I wish to be repaid in shares
of your research and development center

771
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:16,226
based on the stock price of the moment.

772
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:19,396
Will you be okay with that?

773
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:23,859
If our new drug for Alzheimer's
passes Phase Three,

774
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:25,652
as you can probably guess,

775
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:29,323
our stock price will go up
beyond your control.

776
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:39,458
Even Isaac Newton,
the greatest man in human history,

777
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,295
lost most of his money because
he couldn't predict the stock prices.

778
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:45,672
I'm sure this won't happen.

779
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:50,886
But what if they were to turn you down
after the hearing?

780
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:54,139
The stock price will plummet.

781
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:57,100
Fine.

782
00:48:57,893 --> 00:49:01,146
In return, I want your word

783
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:03,941
that you will honor our deal
whatever happens in the end.

784
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:06,568
Of course.

785
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:11,114
Then let's have both of our lawyers
draw up the next contract.

786
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:38,767
<i>Who's your ghost these days?</i>

787
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:44,314
-What?
-Gu Jingi must have gotten you a new one.

788
00:49:44,398 --> 00:49:46,483
A ghost to replace me.

789
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:01,957
How dare he?
He was nothing but a ghost doctor.

790
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:15,095
<i>Hyunseong?</i>

791
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,222
Yuna, where are you?

792
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:19,641
Let's get dinner if you're free.

793
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:21,768
Or we can have a glass of wine.

794
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:25,439
Too bad. I'm meeting up with my friend.

795
00:50:25,647 --> 00:50:28,150
I see. No worries.

796
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:30,068
I called you rather at the last minute.

797
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:32,362
Have a good time with your friend.

798
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:34,531
Bye.

799
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:45,667
Is it Gu Hyunseong?

800
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:50,005
Did he figure out about us?

801
00:50:50,088 --> 00:50:52,007
If he caught on that fast,

802
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:55,135
I wouldn't be with you right now.

803
00:50:57,345 --> 00:51:00,640
So did you let your imagination take over?

804
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:03,268
Let's go someplace else.

805
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:05,103
Where?

806
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:06,563
Where my imagination will take over.

807
00:51:25,957 --> 00:51:27,626
You're totally crazy.

808
00:51:28,293 --> 00:51:30,170
How could you bring me here?

809
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:31,421
Tell me.

810
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:34,341
A man desperate for your affection
is right downstairs.

811
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:37,135
But how does it feel to be with me?

812
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,306
Well,

813
00:51:42,682 --> 00:51:44,059
do you want me to say it?

814
00:52:14,756 --> 00:52:16,466
I finally feel alive now.

815
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:19,845
I'm so sick of being
the perfect daughter of a politician.

816
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:23,640
Besides, my father and his father

817
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:26,351
basically set us up to be together.

818
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:54,713
What's that?

819
00:52:56,798 --> 00:52:57,799
Freedom.

820
00:53:46,806 --> 00:53:48,934
<i>Director Gu that evil man.</i>

821
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:51,269
I'm going to make him regret betraying me.

822
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:54,481
Just wait until I get out of here.
I'm going to find that file…

823
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:56,858
-What file?
-Oh, that?

824
00:53:57,651 --> 00:54:00,153
I made a recording just in case…

825
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:13,833
Where did he hide it?

826
00:54:22,717 --> 00:54:23,969
Lawyer Han Yihan speaking.

827
00:54:24,844 --> 00:54:27,889
<i>Mr. Han?
This is Michael, Jayden's colleague.</i>

828
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:30,016
I have a case for you.

829
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:37,941
What case?

830
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:40,443
<i>I can't discuss it over the phone.</i>

831
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:43,154
Jayden said
he needed you to take this case.

832
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:47,284
I'll send a car to where you are.
Could you come to Banseokwon now?

833
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:57,794
BANSEOK UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

834
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:34,622
This way.

835
00:55:40,962 --> 00:55:42,255
This way, sir.

836
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:50,847
What's this about?

837
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:53,016
Get in. I'll explain it on our way up.

838
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:10,367
I need you to sign it before you go in.

839
00:56:12,827 --> 00:56:13,828
What's this?

840
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:16,915
This is the legal service agreement.
For confidentiality.

841
00:56:17,248 --> 00:56:19,918
It's a sensitive matter.
We can only disclose it to our lawyer.

842
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:23,755
If you need a lawyer, you can ask
Banseok Foundation's legal team for help.

843
00:56:24,672 --> 00:56:27,258
Banseok can never find out.

844
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:28,843
Don't you get it?

845
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:32,180
Why Jayden singled you out
to take over this case?

846
00:56:33,598 --> 00:56:36,976
Don't tell me there's a new problem
I should be aware of.

847
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,478
It's not new.

848
00:56:40,271 --> 00:56:41,689
There's been a problem for a long time.

849
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,859
A very big problem.

850
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:49,114
Did I miss something?

851
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:53,868
<i>They must keep their weaknesses
secret from each other?</i>

852
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:55,745
Please.

853
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:58,581
Jayden really wants you
to handle the case.

854
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:01,459
Fine. I'll sign it.

855
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:05,505
HAN YIHAN

856
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:31,823
Mr. Han. Hurry.

857
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:57,140
I knew you'd come.

858
00:58:00,226 --> 00:58:01,102
Han Yihan!

859
00:58:15,074 --> 00:58:17,160
You needed a doctor, not a lawyer.

860
00:58:19,787 --> 00:58:24,501
A doctor who would never speak
of what happened to anyone.

861
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:29,857
-Mr. Han, I want you to work for me.
<i>-I have conditions.</i>

862
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:32,068
The Central District Prosecutors Office's
prosecutor is at the main entrance.

863
00:59:32,151 --> 00:59:34,737
<i>She received a tip that
someone is doing drugs in the penthouse.</i>

864
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:36,489
-Drugs?
<i>-No. Don't let them pass through.</i>

865
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:39,242
I'll make sure
you end up in prison this time.

866
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:41,411
<i>Answer me. Are you the one who used it?</i>

867
00:59:41,494 --> 00:59:43,746
<i>If you stop now, I'll let this slide.</i>

868
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:46,165
<i>I won't waste this chance.</i>

869
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:49,085
<i>It's the perfect chance to bring
you and Han Yihan down together.</i>

870
00:59:49,168 --> 00:59:51,462
Seokju didn't die because of the surgery.
He was murdered.

871
00:59:51,546 --> 00:59:52,964
<i>Don't give me that nonsense.</i>

872
00:59:53,047 --> 00:59:55,466
Do you expect me to believe that now?

873
00:59:57,510 --> 00:59:59,512
