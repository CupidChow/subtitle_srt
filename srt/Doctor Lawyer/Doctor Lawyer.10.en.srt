THE NAMES OF PEOPLE, INCIDENTS, AND
BACKGROUNDS OF THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:07,382
EPISODE 10

3
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:10,593
Time, please.

4
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:13,430
It's now 3:12 p.m.

5
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,269
I'll remove the heart.

6
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:21,813
<i>A ghost doctor?</i>

7
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:26,067
Mr. Han Yihan was the ghost doctor

8
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:29,946
who operated on the VIPs of Banseokwon
in Gu Hyunseong's place?

9
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:30,864
I am sure.

10
00:00:31,614 --> 00:00:33,908
Director Gu Hyunseong
left for the US five years ago

11
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:35,952
and worked hard to develop surgery robots

12
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,288
because Dr. Han left Banseok.

13
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:40,582
What about

14
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:43,793
how he said he'd operate on me?

15
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,587
He was going to leave it
to another doctor.

16
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:50,300
A new ghost doctor to replace Han Yihan.

17
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:55,305
If what you just said is true,

18
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:57,307
I cannot condone this.

19
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:02,312
That ungrateful man must pay
for making an attempt to deceive me.

20
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:06,149
Then why don't you meet him
to confirm this?

21
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,151
Mr. Han Yihan?

22
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,696
You should meet him
as a doctor, not a lawyer.

23
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:14,491
The best cardiac surgeon in Korea,

24
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:15,992
Dr. Han Yihan.

25
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:52,654
I heard the story.

26
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:56,407
That you are
the best cardiac surgeon in Korea

27
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:59,911
who stood in for Director Gu Hyunseong.

28
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:01,621
Is this true?

29
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:06,960
Please give me an answer.

30
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:11,589
Have you been operating

31
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,926
on the hearts of Banseokwon's VIPs

32
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:16,719
in Gu Hyunseong's place?

33
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:24,644
That's correct.

34
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:30,900
I'm the doctor
who operated in Gu Hyunseong's place.

35
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:34,154
I'm his ghost doctor, Han Yihan.

36
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:46,666
It's nice to meet you.

37
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,585
Can you be

38
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:51,254
in charge of my heart?

39
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:04,893
I'll take charge of your heart.

40
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:19,532
<i>I'll remove the heart.</i>

41
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,004
<i>It's now 3:35 p.m.</i>

42
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,843
NEW-HOPE LAW OFFICE
NEW-HOPE MEDICINE CLINIC

43
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:48,353
How is he?

44
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:49,896
He'll need other examinations,

45
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:53,650
but his ventricular septum is thick,
and the pressure difference is very high.

46
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:55,693
He'll need surgery.

47
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,197
You can sit up.

48
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:05,620
By any chance,

49
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:08,289
have you ever received heart surgery?

50
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,087
You can tell him, Dad.

51
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:17,465
He can keep a secret.

52
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:22,512
All right.

53
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,933
You exposed your disgraceful past,
so I must be honest with you.

54
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:32,355
Yes, I've received
heart transplant surgery.

55
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:35,858
When did you receive it?

56
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:40,071
This is probably the fifth year.

57
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:44,033
-Five years.
-Why? Is there a problem?

58
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:47,495
No, it's for the procedure.

59
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:49,205
Thank you for sharing it with me.

60
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:02,677
Thank you. Yihan, I owe you a lot.

61
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,680
You saved me, then you'll save my dad.

62
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:08,266
I can't guarantee that I'll save him.

63
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:11,269
I can't find out
the result of the surgery beforehand.

64
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:14,314
It didn't feel too real until now,

65
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:17,066
but you seem like a real doctor
after what you did today.

66
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,110
Be honest.

67
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,488
Are you operating on my dad
as a part of your revenge

68
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,991
against Chairman Gu Jingi?

69
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:27,660
It doesn't matter
if this is my revenge or not.

70
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:31,456
We know Gu Hyunseong
can't operate on him anyway.

71
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,624
You're right. Nothing will change.

72
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:35,585
But who knows?

73
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:40,465
We can become much closer.

74
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:42,467
Should we become

75
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,178
even closer than this?

76
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:48,806
Do you think I said that
because I wanted to date you?

77
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,017
We both can benefit from this.

78
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:54,228
I don't want the situation
to get the best of me anymore.

79
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:59,692
In order to prevent that,
I must first create the situation I want.

80
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:07,283
-Do you feel all right, Dad?
-Yes, I'm fine.

81
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:14,540
Let's keep our meeting
under the table for a while.

82
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:15,917
And the condition of my heart.

83
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:18,336
Of course.

84
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:19,921
Thank you

85
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,757
for referring me to a trustworthy friend.

86
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:24,967
You should thank Ms. Lim.

87
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,844
She plays a huge part

88
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,430
in my favor upon you.

89
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,476
All right. I'll stay in touch.

90
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:53,746
How close are you to Jayden?

91
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,541
You don't have to worry.

92
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,252
It's unlike my relationship
with Hyunseong.

93
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:05,341
Gu Hyunseong.
If he really had a ghost doctor,

94
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,010
then we must call off the engagement.

95
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,888
Then will you set me up with another guy

96
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,849
who'll be helpful for your career?

97
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:19,939
From now on, I'll choose everything
regarding work and men.

98
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:22,984
And it won't be to help you

99
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,444
but only for myself.

100
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,578
What do you think you're doing?

101
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:37,331
We said it was a top-secret
that he operated in Gu Hyunseong's place.

102
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,250
I'm sorry.

103
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,711
I needed to show what I had

104
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:45,173
in order to bring a big shot
like Lim Taemoon to our side.

105
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,675
Then you should've told us first.

106
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:50,511
Were we the only ones
bound by confidentiality?

107
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:53,014
I thought it'd be a surprise.

108
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,433
Weren't you and Dr. Han

109
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:58,269
trying to get closer to Lim Taemoon?

110
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,105
What are you doing?

111
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,523
Did you put a tail on us?

112
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:05,109
No, it wasn't you.

113
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,861
I put a tail on Mr. Lim.

114
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:09,280
Tens of trillions of won are at stake
in this project.

115
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:12,241
Of course, we put a tail
on key persons in concern

116
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,743
in order to keep the risks down.

117
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:17,413
I'm not sure why you two are after him,

118
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,915
but feel free to make use

119
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,584
of my wealth and influence.

120
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,461
We seek different things,

121
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:27,965
but our goal is the same,
to destroy Gu Jingi.

122
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:32,136
What do you get
once Lim Taemoon becomes the president?

123
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,723
Every business I begin
in this country will be smoothly conducted

124
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,934
thanks to the highest authority

125
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:40,144
who's very close to Honours Hand.

126
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:44,607
It sounds like you want to make
the president of a country as you wish.

127
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:46,067
Please do understand.

128
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:49,237
It's my job as a lobbyist
to assist a politician

129
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,989
and help him take the power
as someone in favor of our side.

130
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,660
If that's what you're after,
why did you choose Lim Taemoon?

131
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,371
Yoon Miseon has a higher approval rating.

132
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:02,375
It doesn't really show
if you jump on the bandwagon.

133
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,335
In order to become the kingmaker,

134
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,921
you must bet on the underdog.

135
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,758
On top of that, unlike Assemblywoman Yoon,
whose power is mostly domestic,

136
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,802
there are many things I can do

137
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,930
for an ambassador like him.

138
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:21,143
Then what if Lim Taemoon is

139
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:24,438
someone who should never be the president?

140
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,400
What do you mean by that?

141
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,162
Five years ago,

142
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:44,208
my brother was hospitalized
after his heart surgery in Banseokwon,

143
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,544
but Gu Jingi took his heart.

144
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,719
He took the heart?

145
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:58,180
What do you mean?

146
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,183
SURGICAL TIMER, CURRENT TIME,
ANESTHESIA TIMER

147
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:10,943
Hold the suture in place.

148
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:12,612
Yes, sir.

149
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:22,163
Cut. Time.

150
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:26,751
It has been 5 hours and 15 minutes.
Time to speed up.

151
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,127
I know that!

152
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,464
I would be done by now
if I had V-Rock here.

153
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:41,515
Let me finish.

154
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:48,648
Sir, please give me your order.

155
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,484
I'll be your hand.

156
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,907
-Change spots with me.
-Yes, sir.

157
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:24,183
Suture the aorta first.

158
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:25,685
Yes, sir.

159
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:44,286
This kid is a monster too.

160
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,502
There's a high possibility
that Lim Taemoon received the heart

161
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,256
that Chairman Gu Jingi stole
from a patient.

162
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:58,259
Do you have any evidence?

163
00:11:58,342 --> 00:11:59,760
Through his exam today,

164
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,763
I confirmed that he received
a heart transplant surgery five years ago.

165
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:06,851
Once I operate on Lim Taemoon,

166
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:08,561
I'll be able to disclose the rest.

167
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,606
I know it's tough to believe.

168
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:16,819
But if you'll side with Lim Taemoon
and benefit from that,

169
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,946
you need to be notified of such a risk.

170
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:22,074
I don't care which one of the VIPs
got my brother's heart.

171
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:26,454
I'll make sure they pay
just as Gu Jingi will.

172
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:28,873
Don't worry.

173
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:31,417
I know I should accept
high risk for a high return,

174
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,211
but I don't plan on
turning a murder accomplice

175
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,838
into the president.

176
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:39,175
If everything you said proves to be true,

177
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:43,679
instead of siding with Lim Taemoon,
I'll side with you and fight to the end.

178
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:46,265
Thank you for telling me.

179
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:48,392
It feels like we've become closer.

180
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:51,145
I'll immediately share the information

181
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:53,522
I find out in the future.

182
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:06,160
Man, today's operation was just perfect.
So smooth.

183
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:08,746
You punk. I remember
how you never listened to me.

184
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:10,122
You should've done this sooner.

185
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:11,749
Life is great for you now, isn't it?

186
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:14,710
Keep your eyes on the patient.

187
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,546
His condition can worsen quickly
even after good surgery.

188
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,465
Yes, sir.

189
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:24,637
Keep it up, okay?

190
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,029
GIL SOYEON, PATIENT

191
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,159
Hello?

192
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:48,994
<i>Dr. Choi Yosub?</i>

193
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,956
<i>I'd like to meet you.</i>

194
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:57,878
Why did you want to see me?

195
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:03,300
Have you not received the thyroplasty yet?

196
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,386
I couldn't.

197
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:09,181
I wanted to get the surgery
as soon as the trial was over.

198
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:13,227
But I couldn't go into the operating room.

199
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:16,230
The memories of that day came back to me.

200
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,776
I want you to do it.

201
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,321
-Sorry?
-If you come

202
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,991
and operate on me
at Dr. Han Yihan's hospital,

203
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:29,159
I think I'll be able to bear through.

204
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,621
I don't think I can do that.

205
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:34,623
Why?

206
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,960
Thyroplasty must be
operated by an ENT specialist.

207
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:42,214
Yihan and I are both cardiac surgeons,
so we have no experience in this.

208
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:45,384
Then can you at least come into the OR?

209
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:48,429
I don't trust any other doctor.

210
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:53,100
You and Mr. Han are
the only doctors I can trust right now.

211
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,695
-I missed you.
-Me too.

212
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:08,032
You've been busy with a drama,
so we haven't met for two months.

213
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:10,618
Then let's stay together all day today.

214
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:14,288
You can't go anywhere. You're mine.

215
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,666
I'll begin the foot massage.

216
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,293
What do you want to eat?

217
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:20,878
I don't know.

218
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:23,797
There's a good pasta place around here.

219
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,973
What's wrong? Is something going on?

220
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:35,267
I'm sorry, sir.

221
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,645
We brought the wrong oil.

222
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:39,897
We'll get the right ones now.

223
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:41,565
Sure.

224
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,279
Are you insane?

225
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:50,199
How dare you take money
in exchange for our VIP's privacy?

226
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:53,619
I'm sorry. I must have gone crazy.

227
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:57,247
They just asked me to take any video
that'll prove their love scandal--

228
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,208
Do you call that an excuse?

229
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,670
Your resignation won't be the end of this.

230
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:06,298
Expect to hear from our legal team
that we filed a lawsuit against you.

231
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,300
-Excuse me, Chief Yoo.
-What?

232
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,803
I'm sorry to interrupt,

233
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:14,723
but thankfully, it was just an attempt.
Why don't we just let it go quietly?

234
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:18,978
This is a sensitive period.
We shouldn't draw any attention.

235
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:24,441
Turn in your resignation to HR right now.

236
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:25,901
What's the reason--

237
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,237
Make up something! Go do it right now!

238
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,530
Yes, ma'am.

239
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:32,866
Am I having bad luck?

240
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,244
I already had enough to deal with.

241
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,289
Cho Darom.

242
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,709
How long have you been with us?

243
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:43,419
Three months, ma'am.

244
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:46,422
Why do you think our members pay
many times the fee compared to other shops

245
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:47,840
just to come here?

246
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,009
Because we give good massages?

247
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:52,386
No, it's their trust.

248
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:56,557
They trust that what happens in here
never gets out.

249
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,017
I'll remember that.

250
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,769
Anyway, you've done
something very important today.

251
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,981
-Thanks.
-I'm just doing my job.

252
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:07,276
I just followed your guidance,
because you told us that

253
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:10,070
confidentiality is the key
here at Banseokwon.

254
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:11,989
Hey.

255
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,284
Do you want to do special work with me?

256
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:22,541
This is…

257
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:26,211
Assemblywoman Yoon Miseon.
She's the top VVIP of Banseokwon.

258
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,005
You'll be my assistant starting tomorrow.

259
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:30,466
Remember everything to a T.

260
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:33,052
And about our security…
I won't have to elaborate, right?

261
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:35,345
<i>"Yang Sunae, her daughter,</i>

262
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,556
<i>is staying long-term in the VIP ward?"</i>

263
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,017
Thank you for giving me this opportunity.

264
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,853
I'll do my best
with my heart and utmost effort.

265
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,614
I met the chief prosecutor today.

266
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,867
He got furious and demanded
I change Nam Hyukchul's prosecutor.

267
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:02,706
It took a lot of effort to stop him
from reappointing you.

268
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,041
I'm sorry.

269
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:05,334
You're sorry.

270
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,336
And that's all?

271
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,964
I'll take my hands off
Nam Hyukchul's trial.

272
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:14,551
And thank you for letting me stay here.

273
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:18,388
Forget it. I should protect my teammates.

274
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:22,851
Right, what about Assemblywoman Yoon?

275
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,062
Will you restart that case?

276
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:30,067
No, I shouldn't make an issue
during the election season.

277
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,819
There's no new suspicion either.

278
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,737
Good. I'm glad you made that decision.

279
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:38,117
Don't mind them and stay low for a while.

280
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,910
Yes, I'll do that.

281
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:48,961
SENIOR PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE

282
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,338
Prosecutor Geum, was he harsh on you?

283
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,049
I'd rather have him yell at me.

284
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,093
Then I'd feel much more at ease.

285
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:57,594
Sorry?

286
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:03,642
What's your plan after work today?
Do you have any plans?

287
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:06,353
No, I don't.

288
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:10,607
You must feel upset.
So? Should we grab a drink?

289
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:12,609
Let's grab a drink next time,

290
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:16,029
but please give me some time.
There are some people you should meet.

291
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,366
People we should meet?

292
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,748
Let me introduce them to you.
You already know Mr. Han Yihan.

293
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:32,880
Cho Darom, our investigator who was
a former entertainment reporter.

294
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:36,925
And he's Kang Daewoong, a former nurse
at Banseok University Medical Center.

295
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:39,052
I'm the nurse and the chief clerk.

296
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:41,555
Yes, right. The nurse and the chief clerk.

297
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:45,100
This is Mr. Park
of Medical Crime Department,

298
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:48,604
and next to him is
Mr. Jung Heekyung, an investigator.

299
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,565
Nice to meet you. My name is Park Bongsik.

300
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:53,567
Bbongsik?

301
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:56,612
His name is Bbongsik?

302
00:19:56,695 --> 00:20:00,616
No, not Bbongsik.
It's Bongsik. Park Bongsik.

303
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:03,202
I see. I'm so sorry.

304
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:07,247
Prosecutor Geum, he comes off as rude
from the first time. May I leave now?

305
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:11,251
We're sorry. He's a half-wit
who doesn't know when to socialize.

306
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:13,545
I'll teach him a good lesson from now on.

307
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:16,840
It's fine. People make mistakes.

308
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:19,009
Mr. Park also makes slips of the tongue.

309
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:23,138
Hey, I didn't say I was fine.
Why do you get to say that it's fine?

310
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,932
-It's fine, right?
-You punk.

311
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:27,893
All right, we can socialize next time.

312
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:30,312
Why don't we talk about work first?

313
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:31,772
Let's go upstairs.

314
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,402
Assemblywoman Yoon Miseon.

315
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,029
The first, the youngest,

316
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:41,448
and the longest-running female newscaster
at a major TV station.

317
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:42,908
A five-term assemblywoman of Daehan Party.

318
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:45,244
The day we took Nam Junhwan
from Banseokwon,

319
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:48,747
she's the VVIP who made them turn off
the security cameras at Banseokwon.

320
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:51,333
Her chief aide, Kwon Yoonseok.

321
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:54,461
He's her right-hand man.
He's been working for her

322
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:55,796
for 15 years since her first term.

323
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:58,590
Five years ago when I investigated
an illegal political fund case,

324
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,843
he refused to comply with the subpoena
and tried to commit suicide.

325
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,845
<i>And I got him to Banseok University
Medical Center in an ambulance.</i>

326
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,307
I remember him.

327
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:08,976
The patient with a knife
lodged in the chest.

328
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,269
We did the surgery together.

329
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:11,520
That's right.

330
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:15,107
Back then, I didn't have time to think
about work because of my brother.

331
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:17,401
But he got discharged
five months after the surgery.

332
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:19,194
And the investigation fizzled out too.

333
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:22,322
Five months.
He didn't have to stay that long.

334
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,741
I remember his post-ops being fairly good.

335
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:28,287
Well, he was probably stalling,
so the investigation would end.

336
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,038
A lot of people use that method.

337
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:33,250
YOON MISEON WILL PULL IT OFF

338
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,335
At the National Assembly session
the year after that,

339
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,004
a bill to register Banseokwon

340
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:39,006
as a non-medical institution
via a back-door listing was passed.

341
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:40,549
Assemblywoman Yoon led it.

342
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:43,468
Gosh. I can smell something rotting
from a mile away.

343
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,263
But why is she always
visiting Banseokwon at late night?

344
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:48,181
Getting a massage isn't a crime.

345
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:49,766
Maybe, she did more than
getting a massage.

346
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,893
Did she get some special procedure done?

347
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,021
I think I can answer that.

348
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:56,898
Seokyeong, it's my turn now.

349
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,320
Gosh. How pretty.

350
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:05,449
What? She looks familiar.
Is she a celebrity?

351
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:06,992
Yang Sunae. She was born in 1996

352
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:08,744
and is the only daughter
of Assemblywoman Yoon.

353
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,329
Wasn't she famous for being pretty?

354
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:12,205
You all know
Assemblywoman Yoon is divorced, right?

355
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:15,917
She changed prejudices about divorce
and rebranded herself as a career woman

356
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,294
with her daughter's help.

357
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:20,088
She raised her daughter
to be an intelligent, beautiful,

358
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,341
and well-behaved girl
without any help from her husband.

359
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:23,884
It definitely gave her a good reputation.

360
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:25,677
She used her family to promote herself

361
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,554
by giving out press releases herself.

362
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:29,598
I see. That's why.

363
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:34,061
But what does that have to do
with her sneaking into Banseokwon?

364
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:35,937
But her precious daughter

365
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,272
received emergency surgery

366
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,232
and has been staying
at Banseokwon for three months.

367
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:43,153
When you look at her registered guardian,
it's Doh Jinwoo.

368
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,446
Not the assemblywoman.

369
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:47,407
Doh Jinwoo? Who's that?

370
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:48,575
Beats me.

371
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:52,204
Anyway, seeing how he registered
as her guardian when she was admitted,

372
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:53,997
he must be close to her.

373
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:56,666
But there's
Banseok University Medical Center.

374
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,085
And there's a regional ER too.

375
00:22:58,168 --> 00:23:02,464
Why did she get the emergency surgery
at Banseokwon?

376
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:06,968
It's just like Seokju's case
from five years ago.

377
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,972
Emergency surgery for a VIP at Banseokwon.

378
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,852
It had to be kept a secret.

379
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:23,527
Who could that be at this hour?

380
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:30,659
Doh Jinwoo.

381
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:31,701
YANG SUNAE, PATIENT
DOH JINWOO, GUARDIAN

382
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:35,622
NEW-HOPE LAW OFFICE
NEW-HOPE MEDICINE CLINIC

383
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,792
Yihan. It's Dr. Choi.

384
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:43,255
Seriously. How dare he show his face here
after betraying us like that?

385
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:45,507
-I'll go see him.
-Okay.

386
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:59,396
Yihan. I have a favor to ask you.

387
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,235
Soyeon is

388
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:09,281
having a hard time
because of the trauma from the surgery.

389
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:13,368
The thought of going into an OR
makes her hyperventilate

390
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:15,203
and gives her nightmares.

391
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:18,206
She can't trust other doctors
and is scared.

392
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:22,419
So she wants to have it done
at your clinic.

393
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:24,754
She said she would be able to trust us

394
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:27,090
and handle the surgery if we performed it.

395
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:31,428
I understand that, but the thyroplasty

396
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:34,431
should be done
by an experienced ENT specialist.

397
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:36,391
Right. But…

398
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:40,020
just being in the OR with her
will help her.

399
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:44,941
What she needs right now
is a doctor she can trust like us.

400
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:48,737
"Us"? You have no shame.

401
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,655
You betrayed us big time to save yourself.

402
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:53,074
Now, you want to do this
to stop feeling guilty?

403
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:56,286
Yihan, don't do it.
Do you think we're some pushovers?

404
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:57,621
Daewoong.

405
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,462
-Let's do it together.
-Yihan!

406
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:10,467
Soyeon dealt with her trauma
from medical malpractice,

407
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:12,177
trusted us, and stayed with us.

408
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:15,514
So we should help her to the end.

409
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,558
I mean, that's…

410
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:20,393
That's true.

411
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:23,688
Thank you, Yihan. And…

412
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:25,273
I'm sorry.

413
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:29,277
Daewoong, I'm sorry.
You got hurt because of me.

414
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:32,906
Well, it's not about the injury.

415
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:46,419
Hyunseong 's mother,

416
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:49,673
Jang Jungok… The Head of the US office
will return to Korea soon.

417
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:53,051
If Chairman Gu Jingi becomes
the Minister of Health and Welfare,

418
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:55,554
he will need someone
to take over his position.

419
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:57,973
And if Gu Hyunseong becomes
the director of the hospital too,

420
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:01,393
Banseok will be
one of those typical family businesses.

421
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:04,396
And they probably think of you,
the R and D Center's director,

422
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:06,147
as their family already.

423
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:07,274
Family.

424
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:11,945
My father had always been the shackles
I wanted to break free from.

425
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:15,949
So I studied medical engineering.

426
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:18,493
But I'm still in his shadow.

427
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,579
If you marry Gu Hyunseong,

428
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:24,082
what will your father get in return?

429
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:25,500
What do you mean?

430
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:28,628
An arranged marriage
is high-level politics.

431
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:31,423
It will never go through unless
both parties gain something in return.

432
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:35,010
Gu Jingi will gain a lot
from having your father as his in-law.

433
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:39,723
But what about your father?
What will he gain from this marriage?

434
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:45,937
To him, not losing something
is more important than gaining something.

435
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:50,692
If you're thinking about investing in
the presidential candidate as a lobbyist,

436
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:51,776
you ought to be more careful.

437
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:57,574
My father comes with a lot of strengths

438
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:59,826
as well as weaknesses.

439
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:57,634
How was your flight?

440
00:27:57,717 --> 00:28:00,428
Good. Let's go to the hospital right away.

441
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:01,680
Yes, ma'am.

442
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:08,520
BANSEOK FOUNDATION
2022 EXTRAORDINARY BOARD MEETING ITEMS

443
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:10,397
CHAIRMAN GU JINGI'S DISMISSAL OF
THE TITLES DUE TO NOMINATION OF MINISTER

444
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,190
Has it been five years
since you came back?

445
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:16,486
Yes. It's already been five years.

446
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:18,488
You're such a workaholic.

447
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:21,366
You must be enjoying your youth.
But you're not even dating.

448
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:23,159
You never leave the hospital.

449
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:26,454
If I didn't ask you,
you wouldn't have come back, right?

450
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:30,083
You're a newly appointed director
at Banseok Foundation, after all.

451
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:32,127
And this is an important moment too.

452
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,839
This is more than I deserve.

453
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:40,635
Once you become the chairwoman,
I plan to go back right away.

454
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,137
Who can stop you?

455
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:45,306
I can leave the office in your hands
because I know you will do a fine job.

456
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,391
So you know, right?

457
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:49,060
When I'm in Korea as the chairwoman,

458
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:53,273
you're the acting head
of the US office. Okay?

459
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:04,868
Next, I will move on
to the highlight of today's auction.

460
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,954
Nineteen whisky masters

461
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:09,789
made this over 72 hours.

462
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:12,083
Only three bottles were produced
in the entire world.

463
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:14,419
It's 65-year-old single malt whisky.

464
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:17,213
It was aged in a carefully selected
sherry oak cask.

465
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:20,008
This is considered
the best product of Macury.

466
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:22,093
A bottle of this was sold
for 1.45 billion won

467
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:25,096
at an auction in Hong Kong last week

468
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,307
and became the highest-priced
single bottle of whisky

469
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,933
throughout auctions in Asia.

470
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,769
We'll begin the bidding
at one billion won.

471
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:32,854
And we'll raise it by 50 million won.

472
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:34,230
Let us begin.

473
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:35,857
One billion won.

474
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:38,234
Thank you. Anyone for 1.05 billion won?

475
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:40,820
That's 1.05 billion won. Thank you.
1.1 billion won.

476
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:43,948
We have a bidder. 1.15 billion won?
Yes, we have another bidder.

477
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:46,451
How about 1.2 billion won?

478
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:48,828
We're at 1.2 billion won.
Anyone for 1.25 billion won?

479
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,955
Okay. 1.25 billion won.

480
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,333
How about 1.3 billion won?

481
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:55,043
Yes. We're at 1.3 billion won now.

482
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:57,170
How about 1.35 billion won?

483
00:29:57,253 --> 00:30:00,340
Okay. The highest bid now
is 1.35 billion won.

484
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:02,008
Anyone for 1.4 billion won?

485
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,218
I call 1.5 billion won.

486
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:06,262
All right. We're at 1.5 billion won.

487
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:09,390
We have the highest bid in Asia,
1.5 billion won.

488
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:12,727
Does anyone want to take it
for 1.55 billion won?

489
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:15,021
If there's no one, I will wrap up.

490
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:17,565
Yes. The gentleman in the back
bid 1.55 billion won.

491
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:22,237
That's amazing. 1.55 billion won.

492
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,113
The highest bid is 1.55 billion won.

493
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:27,575
All right. We will have to raise it
to 1.6 billion won now.

494
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:28,785
Will you bid 1.6 billion won?

495
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:31,663
-Yes, he bid 1.6 billion won.
-What?

496
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:34,999
Yes. 1.65 billion won.
He bid 1.65 billion won right away.

497
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:37,836
You must bid 1.7 billion won
to take this bottle.

498
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:39,671
He's thinking now. 1.7 billion won…

499
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:41,631
-I call 1.7 billion won.
-Okay. He bid 1.7 billion won.

500
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:44,342
I see. The gentleman in the back
bid 1.75 billion won.

501
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:46,094
The highest bid now is 1.75 billion won.

502
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:49,430
You must bid 1.8 billion won
to take this bottle.

503
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:50,723
What about 1.8 billion? Anyone?

504
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:52,642
Go for it.

505
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:56,396
He bid 1.8 billion won, everyone.

506
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:58,773
Would you like to make
the highest bid, 1.85 billion won?

507
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,817
Will you bid?

508
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,027
Let's end this.

509
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:05,154
Two billion won.

510
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:07,824
He just bid two billion won!

511
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:10,910
We just received an incredible bid,
two billion won!

512
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:14,539
How about 2.05 billion won?
Will you bid 2.05 billion won?

513
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:17,208
All right. Unless there's another bidder,
I'll wrap it up at two billion won.

514
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:21,004
Two billion won.

515
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:22,922
Sold!

516
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:28,887
The 65-year-old single malt whisky
from Macury

517
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:32,015
was sold to Number 29 at two billion won.

518
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:33,057
Congratulations.

519
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:36,853
Darn it.

520
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:39,689
Who the heck was that? He spent
two billion won on a bottle of whisky.

521
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:42,150
I was going to show off
in front of the foundation directors.

522
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:43,735
Exactly.

523
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:46,362
I bet everyone is looking forward to this.

524
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:50,617
Even if they got their entire savings,
it wouldn't be enough to buy that.

525
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:53,369
Hey.

526
00:31:56,456 --> 00:32:00,084
It was a nice bidding war.
I had fun thanks to you.

527
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,712
Bidding war?
He was basically showing off his money.

528
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,715
Are you here to gloat?

529
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:10,219
Please take it. This is yours.

530
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:16,267
What is this? Are you making fun of us?

531
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:18,061
It's a present…

532
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:25,193
for the new chairman
of Banseok Foundation.

533
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:29,322
Well…

534
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,913
YOON MISEON WILL PULL IT OFF

535
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:39,958
CERTIFICATE OF APPRECIATION
YOON MISEON

536
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:46,464
ASSEMBLYWOMAN YOON MISEON

537
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:58,226
It will sting a bit.

538
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:05,483
I increased the ratio
for umbilical cord blood,

539
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:07,902
so your skin will glow
during the presidential debate.

540
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:11,406
This is the stem cell cream.

541
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:17,954
Your touches are always pleasant,
Chief Yoo.

542
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:21,666
Is that her? Your new assistant?

543
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:23,960
Yes. Say hello to her.

544
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:26,254
It's an honor to meet you.

545
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:29,966
My name is Cho Darom.
I'll be assisting Chief Yoo from now on.

546
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,552
I still have a lot to learn,
but I will do my best.

547
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:35,888
You're polite, unlike girls at your age.

548
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:37,015
How old are you?

549
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:38,224
I'm 30 years old.

550
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:40,476
Thirty.

551
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,146
You're about the same age as my daughter.

552
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:46,733
Come on in.

553
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,613
There's something I must report.

554
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,617
Go ahead. It's fine.

555
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:59,787
Yes, ma'am. The order
you gave out for your daughter.

556
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:01,581
It will be executed today.

557
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:05,877
Okay. Tell them not to make any mistakes.

558
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:07,086
Yes, ma'am.

559
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:14,343
I'll let you handle the rest.

560
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:17,221
Just let me get some quality sleep
for three hours.

561
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:20,308
I've been having a hard time
falling asleep these days.

562
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:21,434
Yes, ma'am.

563
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,622
GLUCOSE

564
00:34:58,387 --> 00:35:00,431
-Are you sure this is the place?
-Yes.

565
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:04,727
The address on Yang Sunae's hospital file
says it's Unit 607 of this building.

566
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:07,522
Doesn't it look a bit shabby
for an assemblywoman's daughter?

567
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:11,442
Look around the neighborhood.
I'll go upstairs.

568
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:12,527
Okay.

569
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:36,217
Darn it.

570
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:39,637
Mr. Doh Jinwoo?

571
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,305
Who are you? Move out of my way.

572
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:42,431
Move.

573
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:27,143
Daewoong,
come to the entrance of the apartment.

574
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:29,604
Gosh, that darn weasel.

575
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:33,691
You're dead meat. Come here.

576
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:35,151
Come here, you punk!

577
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:40,239
Hey, why don't we just walk down
if you don't mind?

578
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:43,993
Or should I make you crawl on all fours?

579
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:45,328
Come here.

580
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:47,872
Come here, you punk.

581
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:58,966
Hey!

582
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:06,140
Hold on.

583
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:08,851
Come on.

584
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:30,957
Yihan!

585
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:48,599
Excuse me.

586
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:54,397
Sorry.

587
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:06,450
Mr. Doh Jinwoo.

588
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:09,370
You know Ms. Yang Sunae, right?
Let's talk for a moment.

589
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,961
I'm not with them. I'm an attorney.

590
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:20,715
I want to ask you about Ms. Yang Sunae.

591
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:36,981
Don't give me that nonsense.

592
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,482
Sunae and I

593
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:41,193
won't let people like you
take advantage of us anymore.

594
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,373
-You…
-Doctor.

595
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:56,417
It's been a while.

596
00:38:56,959 --> 00:39:00,004
No. Should I call you a lawyer now?

597
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:03,257
Easy.

598
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:10,306
Let's not cross the line.

599
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:15,811
If we start crossing the line,
people will get hurt. You see?

600
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:17,772
Just like before.

601
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:19,065
I'm not sure about that.

602
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:22,276
I think the table has turned today.

603
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:28,908
What's this?

604
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:32,703
Gosh.

605
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:35,247
Yihan, he's the bad guy. Right?

606
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:36,999
I didn't mess up, right?

607
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:39,085
No.

608
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:45,841
So you lost him?

609
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:47,093
I'm sorry.

610
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:52,556
ASSEMBLYWOMAN YOON MISEON

611
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:00,147
Yoonseok.

612
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:04,610
You were nothing but a mere driver.

613
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:08,489
Do you know why I made you the chief aide?

614
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:12,118
Because you were loyal.

615
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:15,037
There are a lot of smart
and competent people.

616
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,874
But you're the only one
who would die for me.

617
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:23,087
That's why I'm giving you one more chance.

618
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:25,631
Do whatever it takes

619
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:27,883
to make sure he never sees

620
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,970
Sunae ever again.

621
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:34,265
-Got it?
-Yes, ma'am.

622
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:37,309
Okay. You can go.

623
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:51,699
ASSEMBLYWOMAN YOON MISEON

624
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:53,200
There's something I must discuss.

625
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:55,453
<i>I'll go to Banseokwon tonight.</i>

626
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:57,329
Okay.

627
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,417
Honey.

628
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:04,837
The meal is ready.
Shall I tell them to wait?

629
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,006
No. I am coming.

630
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:14,013
I am sorry for making you wait
when you haven't come back in a while.

631
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:15,639
It's okay.

632
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:17,600
Let's eat.

633
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:20,936
We can take our time with conversations.

634
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,062
Okay. Let's eat.

635
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:23,981
Okay.

636
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:28,736
NEW-HOPE LAW OFFICE
NEW-HOPE MEDICINE CLINIC

637
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:30,196
<i>Boyfriend?</i>

638
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:32,323
You and the goddess…

639
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:35,576
I mean, you and Sunae are dating?

640
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:38,245
-How?
-Is there something wrong with it?

641
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,789
There isn't anything wrong with it,

642
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:43,209
but the two of you are very different.

643
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:44,376
I apologize.

644
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:47,713
This punk has no sensitivity whatsoever.

645
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:49,298
Apologize to him right now.

646
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:50,424
Okay.

647
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:51,342
I understand.

648
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:55,804
Sunae is way out of my league.

649
00:41:56,388 --> 00:41:58,390
Well… I am sorry.

650
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:01,060
You practically flew
between buildings earlier.

651
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:02,561
You looked so cool.

652
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:05,731
What is it called? Parkour?

653
00:42:05,814 --> 00:42:09,026
-Freerunning.
-I see.

654
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:10,569
It's something similar.

655
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:14,406
In any case, would you explain
what happened earlier?

656
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:18,702
Why did they try to kidnap you?

657
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:26,752
Assemblywoman Yoon Miseon sent them

658
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:28,212
to keep me quiet.

659
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:33,676
Sunae you know isn't real.

660
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:35,761
Assemblywoman Yoon made that image,

661
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:37,513
but Sunae

662
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:39,640
hated it.

663
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:42,101
Tell me.

664
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:44,770
What happened between
Assemblywoman Yoon and her daughter?

665
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:49,525
In fifth grade,

666
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:52,361
she had her first surgery.

667
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:56,323
She is beautiful
because she takes after you,

668
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:59,243
but her protruding ears ruin her looks.

669
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:01,912
-Is it possible to fix them?
-Yes, it is.

670
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:04,456
Ears stop growing
in the early teenage years.

671
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:08,252
But since ears have a lot of nerves,

672
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:09,628
the surgery will be painful.

673
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:12,590
She could suffer a lot
if she gets the surgery at a young age.

674
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:14,091
It's okay. Please fix them.

675
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:15,634
Mom.

676
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:19,763
To be a better person,

677
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:22,224
you need to erase one fault at a time.

678
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:24,852
I will help you

679
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:29,064
so that you can be more perfect.

680
00:43:30,482 --> 00:43:31,692
Okay?

681
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:40,951
Your nutrition and exercises

682
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:43,120
have been taken care of perfectly.

683
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:45,331
Why aren't you growing any taller?

684
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:48,626
Your legs are short and ugly too.

685
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:51,587
Who do you take after?

686
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:57,092
After she became an adult, she was forced
to get limb-lengthening surgery.

687
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:03,307
But Assemblywoman Yoon
is well-known to love her daughter.

688
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:04,892
It's a lie.

689
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:06,602
It isn't love, but abuse.

690
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:10,064
Sunae never wanted that life.

691
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:11,023
It was Yoon Miseon,

692
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:14,193
that woman's greed.

693
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:19,823
It was too painful to see Sunae suffer,

694
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:22,618
<i>so I went to Assemblywoman Yoon
and asked her to set Sunae free.</i>

695
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:26,246
<i>I said I would tell the media outlets
about her abuse otherwise.</i>

696
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:27,331
You punk.

697
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:30,250
-<i>She became extremely angry,</i>
-Let go of me!

698
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:32,544
<i>but she accepted my terms.</i>

699
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:35,381
That was when the two of you…

700
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:36,590
Yes.

701
00:44:37,257 --> 00:44:38,217
We lived together.

702
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:42,346
Our place was old and cramped.

703
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:45,265
There were many inconveniences,

704
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:47,726
but we were happy

705
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:49,812
to be together.

706
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:53,941
But…

707
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:59,613
Sunae! What's wrong?

708
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:01,115
Sunae.

709
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:04,118
Sunae, it's okay.

710
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:07,663
<i>She needed surgery for the aftereffect
of limb-lengthening surgery,</i>

711
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:11,333
so I had no choice
but to contact Assemblywoman Yoon.

712
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:15,212
She got admitted to Banseokwon
and received surgery.

713
00:45:16,463 --> 00:45:17,589
As far as we know,

714
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:21,802
Sunae hasn't left Banseokwon
for over three months.

715
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:24,471
I don't know what Sunae's condition is.

716
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:27,975
After she entered Banseokwon,
Assemblywoman Yoon kept me away.

717
00:45:30,185 --> 00:45:31,729
I am worried sick.

718
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:34,064
I want to know if the surgery went well.

719
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:37,109
I want to know if she is alive.

720
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:53,542
I plan to resign

721
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:57,421
before the board of directors
brings it up.

722
00:45:58,005 --> 00:46:00,048
It's a position I have to give up anyway.

723
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:02,384
It shouldn't look like I am being ousted.

724
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:03,385
I agree.

725
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:06,346
There is no reason
to let them set the pace.

726
00:46:07,055 --> 00:46:10,392
Both positions should be vacant
until the hearing.

727
00:46:10,976 --> 00:46:12,728
Once you become the minister,

728
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:15,564
the directors will yield naturally.

729
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:19,193
No.

730
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:22,070
I will appoint the hospital director
before I resign.

731
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:24,448
My son.

732
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:26,366
You can do well, right?

733
00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:29,203
Father.

734
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:31,413
Honey.

735
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:35,626
I believe Hyunseong will do well,

736
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:39,213
but wouldn't it look bad if you appoint
him before your resignation?

737
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:42,591
If I say it's the last appointment
before my resignation,

738
00:46:42,674 --> 00:46:43,926
it will be justified.

739
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:47,304
He will soon be the head of a family.
We need to help him.

740
00:46:49,014 --> 00:46:51,517
Okay. Do what you want.

741
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:55,020
You dote on your son more than I do.

742
00:46:57,356 --> 00:46:58,857
-You must do well.
-Okay.

743
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:07,074
The aromas are nice.

744
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:09,910
This liquor is on another level.

745
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:11,870
Director Jang Jungtae,
let me pour you a glass.

746
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:13,330
Okay. Thank you.

747
00:47:14,122 --> 00:47:15,457
Goodness.

748
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:19,962
I don't know
if I can receive this precious gift.

749
00:47:20,045 --> 00:47:21,463
Please don't be pressured.

750
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:24,883
Even if it weren't for you,
it would have ended up in your hands.

751
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:28,136
It must have taken a lot of effort
to get this liquor.

752
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:30,514
I don't know
if we should be drinking by ourselves.

753
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:33,934
Three bottles have been made.
Since one bottle is here,

754
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:35,435
someone must have

755
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,230
the other two.

756
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:53,328
Could it be

757
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:55,873
the same liquor?

758
00:47:55,956 --> 00:48:00,294
Did you win it
at the Hong Kong auction as well?

759
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:01,587
I was lucky.

760
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:04,381
I acquired two bottles of nice liquor

761
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:06,884
before a meeting with important people.

762
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:11,513
Please share this
with the directors of Banseok Foundation.

763
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:15,142
Please tell them that it's my small gift.

764
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:17,227
A small gift?

765
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:19,688
I don't know how rich you are,

766
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:22,608
but excessive modesty
comes off as arrogance.

767
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:25,527
I apologize if you felt that way.

768
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:30,198
I simply meant that this is nothing
compared to the wealth

769
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:34,870
the directors and I will enjoy together
in the future.

770
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:41,710
Together? What do you mean?

771
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:43,670
Let's talk more as we drink.

772
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:48,342
The night is still young.

773
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:00,062
Let me see you, my son.

774
00:49:01,396 --> 00:49:03,357
-You can do well, right?
-Of course.

775
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:04,691
Okay.

776
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:16,203
My wife doesn't know what happened, right?

777
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:20,582
-No, sir.
-I am always grateful for you.

778
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:22,584
I was five years ago and I am now.

779
00:49:23,877 --> 00:49:25,796
May I ask you a question?

780
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:28,590
That day,

781
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,760
Geum Seokju's heart

782
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:34,930
was damaged beyond saving.

783
00:49:35,013 --> 00:49:38,266
But it wasn't due to emergency phlebotomy.

784
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:40,060
Okay.

785
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:53,532
<i>It was the heart
of a dilated cardiomyopathy patient,</i>

786
00:49:54,282 --> 00:49:55,951
but there was

787
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:57,828
no cardiac tamponade.

788
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:01,873
"A clear cause of death
minimizes the damage to the hospital,

789
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:03,458
so change the results of the autopsy

790
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:07,170
to a cardiac tamponade
due to the pulmonary artery rupture.

791
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:12,551
Medical malpractice isn't punished,
so Dr. Han won't be harmed."

792
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:17,514
I trusted your words
and changed the autopsy results.

793
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:19,599
Was that the only reason?

794
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:21,560
Was there another reason--

795
00:50:21,643 --> 00:50:22,644
Did you truly believe my words

796
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:26,440
-when you fabricated the results?
-Pardon?

797
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:30,193
You could have refused,
but you followed without a complaint.

798
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:32,237
Now that it seems to be a bigger issue,

799
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:34,364
you say that you trusted my words.

800
00:50:35,323 --> 00:50:36,366
What is it?

801
00:50:36,616 --> 00:50:39,911
Are you scared now that Han Yihan is back
and Park Kitae is dead?

802
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:44,416
Did you realize that your action was
more immoral than you initially thought?

803
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:49,838
You aren't feeling guilty. You are simply

804
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:52,215
afraid.

805
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:55,677
You don't want
your wrongdoing to be revealed.

806
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:58,472
No, it's not like…

807
00:50:58,555 --> 00:50:59,556
If…

808
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:02,559
you are certain
that you won't be punished,

809
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:05,729
your flimsy sense of guilt…

810
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:10,859
will disappear without a trace

811
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:12,527
like snow in spring.

812
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:14,529
No, I…

813
00:51:15,113 --> 00:51:15,947
I promise you

814
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:20,827
that you will never be punished.

815
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:23,789
So you don't need to be afraid.

816
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:26,208
Understood?

817
00:51:32,964 --> 00:51:35,759
Are you done already?
You haven't gone on a date in a while.

818
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:38,970
Forget about a date. I am tired.
The flight was long.

819
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:42,307
What are you going to do?
Do you want to stay the night?

820
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:44,601
She is leaving.

821
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:45,602
Yes.

822
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:49,064
I will get going now.

823
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:51,191
-Get some rest.
-Yes, sir.

824
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:58,073
Why is she so busy? Is she tired?

825
00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:02,244
I should retreat to my room
and get some rest. How about you?

826
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:05,455
Assemblywoman Yoon is at Banseokwon,
so I have to drop by.

827
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:07,666
Does she think she is your superior?

828
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:09,501
She visits all the time.

829
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:11,336
-Get some rest.
-Okay.

830
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:13,547
My goodness.

831
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:25,433
Foolish girl.

832
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:29,980
I raised you like a princess.

833
00:52:31,106 --> 00:52:33,567
You had every reason to be happy.

834
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:37,404
Why did you break my heart?

835
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:40,448
Don't worry now, my daughter.

836
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:43,034
I won't let you go.

837
00:52:44,035 --> 00:52:45,495
I will have your mean heart fixed too

838
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:49,499
as I did with your body.

839
00:53:23,783 --> 00:53:24,993
Doh Jinwoo.

840
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:29,080
He is the punk
who fooled and destroyed my daughter.

841
00:53:30,248 --> 00:53:32,125
Mr. Han Yihan hid him.

842
00:53:32,792 --> 00:53:34,920
Hid him? How…

843
00:53:35,003 --> 00:53:37,505
That's what I want to ask you.

844
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:39,090
How did he find out?

845
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:42,719
From the day she received surgery,

846
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:48,141
my daughter hasn't left Banseokwon.

847
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:51,853
I apologize for inconveniencing you.

848
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:53,230
I don't need your apology.

849
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:55,523
How will you take responsibility?

850
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:57,317
From the start,

851
00:53:58,777 --> 00:54:01,821
he threatened me
with the nonsense of abuse.

852
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:03,657
So I wanted to shut his mouth.

853
00:54:03,865 --> 00:54:07,077
But that lawyer will ruin everything.

854
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:10,747
Why don't we postpone the time
she wakes up?

855
00:54:11,706 --> 00:54:15,001
Postpone the time? What do you mean?

856
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:19,464
As you know, she is in the final stage
of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

857
00:54:19,547 --> 00:54:23,260
Even if she wakes up,
she won't be able to do normal activities.

858
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:27,514
Had Sunae stayed by my side,

859
00:54:27,847 --> 00:54:30,767
her disease
wouldn't have progressed so much.

860
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:32,769
It's a shame.

861
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:36,064
She worsened her condition
by leaving her disease untreated.

862
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:39,442
If she gains consciousness

863
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:42,988
and insists on leaving the hospital
in order to stay by his side,

864
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:45,615
her life will be in danger.

865
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:47,951
What should I do then?

866
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:51,496
Let's inject her with a concoction
that won't hurt her body

867
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:54,582
in order to keep her
in suspended animation

868
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,502
and look for lungs
that can be transplanted.

869
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:01,047
It will also give you time
to retrieve Doh Jinwoo from Han Yihan.

870
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:03,383
So we will use drugs

871
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:05,969
to keep Sunae asleep.

872
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:09,681
For now, that's the most certain way

873
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,850
to protect your daughter.

874
00:55:12,058 --> 00:55:14,185
You shouldn't endanger the life

875
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:16,855
of your precious daughter

876
00:55:17,522 --> 00:55:19,441
because of that classless man.

877
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:22,902
I have a son too.

878
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:26,406
You can't always see
eye to eye with your child.

879
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:28,283
So what can you do

880
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:31,202
other than help your child find

881
00:55:31,786 --> 00:55:33,204
the right path?

882
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:35,498
That's a parent's responsibility.

883
00:55:40,253 --> 00:55:43,757
We'll keep in contact more often
from now on.

884
00:55:44,382 --> 00:55:46,134
Okay. I am in your care.

885
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:57,937
-Let's get going.
-Yes, ma'am.

886
00:56:03,985 --> 00:56:07,489
-Are you okay?
-What kind of a lunatic…

887
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:10,825
Please stay in the car. I will check.

888
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:16,581
We meet again, Chairman Gu Jingi.

889
00:56:16,664 --> 00:56:17,916
What brings you here at this hour?

890
00:56:17,999 --> 00:56:20,585
The guardian of your patient

891
00:56:20,668 --> 00:56:24,089
sued the hospital for negligence and
a violation of the Medical Service Act.

892
00:56:24,172 --> 00:56:25,924
Pardon? What do you mean?

893
00:56:32,847 --> 00:56:34,140
It's nice to meet you.

894
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:35,517
I am Prosecutor Geum Seokyeong

895
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:36,976
of Medical Crime Department in Seoul
Central District Prosecutors' Office.

896
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:38,937
Banseok has been sued

897
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:41,689
for a Medical Service Act violation
regarding your daughter, Yang Sunae.

898
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:43,775
May I ask a few questions?

899
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:50,740
I apologize, Assemblywoman Yoon.
There must be a misunderstanding.

900
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:54,661
Ms. Yang Sunae is recovering
without a problem at the hospital.

901
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:55,995
That's correct.

902
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:58,998
As her guardian, I entrusted the hospital
with her treatment.

903
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:01,543
So stop interfering and go back.

904
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:03,753
I won't put up with more rudeness.

905
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:05,964
No. I can't do that.

906
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:10,135
You are no longer Yang Sunae's guardian.

907
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:12,303
What nonsense…

908
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:23,857
I am her family,

909
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:26,151
not you.

910
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:29,320
What? What nonsense are you spouting?

911
00:57:30,321 --> 00:57:31,322
Check for yourself.

912
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:43,376
MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE
DOH JINWOO, YANG SUNAE

913
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:44,752
Marriage certificate?

914
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:49,549
You are the director of a hospital,
so you would know

915
00:57:50,341 --> 00:57:52,260
whether a parent or a spouse

916
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:56,473
<i>has a say in decision-making
for an unconscious patient.</i>

917
00:57:57,265 --> 00:57:58,808
What nonsense is this?

918
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:01,895
Marriage? My daughter?

919
00:58:02,103 --> 00:58:04,439
Sunae couldn't have gotten married
without my permission.

920
00:58:04,522 --> 00:58:05,440
You have

921
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:08,818
no right to be Sunae's family.

922
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:09,777
Right?

923
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:13,323
I am her mom. What right do I need?

924
00:58:14,532 --> 00:58:18,161
Sunae is mine. You are the one
who ruined my daughter's life.

925
00:58:18,411 --> 00:58:19,954
If it weren't for you…

926
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:24,959
He didn't ruin her life.

927
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:28,630
-Excuse me?
-Sunae's life isn't ruined.

928
00:58:28,713 --> 00:58:30,465
She will get back up again

929
00:58:31,132 --> 00:58:33,635
and live her own life from now on.

930
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:53,112
I doubted it,

931
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:56,866
but you really intended
to have both in your hands.

932
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:02,789
You must be very concerned

933
00:59:03,581 --> 00:59:06,960
about making your daughter fall
into a critical condition.

934
00:59:11,589 --> 00:59:14,676
I am Doh Jinwoo's attorney, Han Yihan.

935
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:18,721
We will move Ms. Yang Sunae
to New-Hope Medicine Clinic.

936
00:59:23,768 --> 00:59:25,895
Even if it's a guardian's request,

937
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:29,983
transferring a critical patient
at such late hours is against our policy.

938
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:32,569
We must think about the patient's safety.

939
00:59:32,777 --> 00:59:34,737
If you care so much about patients,

940
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:37,282
why did you move Nam Junhwan here
right after surgery?

941
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:39,867
You even used violence.

942
00:59:43,162 --> 00:59:46,082
Lead us to Yang Sunae

943
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:48,626
right now.

944
01:00:42,221 --> 01:00:43,348
What do you want me to do?

945
01:00:43,431 --> 01:00:47,268
Wait. It could cause the patient to die.
Are you aware of this?

946
01:00:47,352 --> 01:00:49,479
Chairman Gu, what is he talking about?

947
01:00:49,562 --> 01:00:50,563
<i>Lung transplant is the only way.</i>

948
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:53,983
The person
who can donate lungs the fastest

949
01:00:54,567 --> 01:00:55,652
is her family.

950
01:00:55,735 --> 01:00:57,862
Please donate lungs to Sunae with me.

951
01:00:57,987 --> 01:01:01,324
Michael and I will attend
the board meeting as investors.

952
01:01:01,407 --> 01:01:03,368
<i>We must stop Gu Hyunseong
from becoming the director.</i>

953
01:01:03,451 --> 01:01:05,119
<i>I will assist you properly tomorrow.</i>

954
01:01:05,203 --> 01:01:07,038
Let's decide by vote.

955
01:01:07,121 --> 01:01:09,874
Before we do that,
I would like to say a few words.

956
01:01:09,957 --> 01:01:10,833
Did you wait for me?

957
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:13,711
