1
00:00:00,834 --> 00:00:04,879
THE NAMES OF PEOPLE, INCIDENTS, AND
BACKGROUNDS OF THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:08,383
Ms. Yoon Miseon refused to donate

3
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:10,468
right before general anesthesia.

4
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:51,718
Did you actually want
to donate your organ?

5
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:55,764
Has this been your plan from the start?

6
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,976
Many organ donors change their minds

7
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,686
right before the surgery.

8
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:06,107
Just because she's family,
she isn't obliged to sacrifice.

9
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:10,528
It's unfortunate,
but that's all for today's surgery.

10
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:19,162
She got one lung transplanted,

11
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:20,872
so she'll be better than before, right?

12
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:22,415
Yes, I'm sure.

13
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:26,461
The fibrosis
in her left upper lobe isn't too bad,

14
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:29,631
so I'll take good care of her
until her next transplant surgery

15
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:32,258
is decided.

16
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:33,968
Please do that.

17
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:35,887
Yes, ma'am.

18
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,934
Dr. Han. I detect pulmonary edema.

19
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:43,895
Her right lower lobe seemed smaller.

20
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:46,189
It will be dangerous
if we don't transplant the lungs now.

21
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,151
-Is nitrogen gas ready? Put it in.
-Yes.

22
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:51,945
Increase the drainage to collapse the RA.

23
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:53,238
Yes, Doctor.

24
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,782
Pulmonary arterial pressure at 35
and rising.

25
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:57,617
We're using a draining cannula.

26
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:06,918
-What's going on?
-It looks like pulmonary failure.

27
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:10,630
-Pulmonary failure?
-The transplanted lung was too small,

28
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:13,216
so it's unable to handle
the amount of blood flow

29
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:15,635
coming in from the heart.

30
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:17,262
Then…

31
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:20,640
The surgeon is diverting the flow
with a cardiopulmonary bypass machine

32
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:24,227
and cannulating the pulmonary artery
to decrease the pressure, but…

33
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,479
But what?

34
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,064
It's only a temporary measure.

35
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:30,775
In order to resolve this,

36
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,485
she needs another left lung

37
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:35,363
to disperse the blood flow.

38
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:45,707
Yoonseok.

39
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:52,755
You need to do this.

40
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:55,008
Sorry?

41
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,806
Please save my Sunae.

42
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:05,727
Then once I have
the power over this country,

43
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:08,146
I'll take care of you until the end.

44
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,940
-Ma'am.
-That's impossible.

45
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,610
In order to donate his lung,

46
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:18,198
he needs to apply in advance
and go through many exams and procedures.

47
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:22,744
-I cannot make a decision now.
-Then find another way!

48
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:28,541
I put on this show when you said
we should at least get her one lung.

49
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:32,170
What now? How will you save my daughter?

50
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:33,421
You can do it.

51
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:38,676
You applied and got examined.

52
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,429
If you truly love her
and want to save her,

53
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:43,306
you can donate yours for her.

54
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:47,602
I can't do that.

55
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:52,065
The primary election will be held
in less than a week.

56
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,484
If I get this surgery now…

57
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:57,737
Is your presidency
more important than your daughter's life?

58
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:02,742
Know this.

59
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:05,328
If Ms. Yang Sunae dies today,

60
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,372
it's because of you, her mother.

61
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:08,873
Your…

62
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,919
stupidity and greed are

63
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:15,838
the cause of her death.

64
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:33,189
Pulmonary arterial pressure is at 14.
It went down a lot.

65
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:36,276
We turned from a hefty crisis,
but what now? She won't last long.

66
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,736
We have no other choice
but to keep the pump going.

67
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:40,947
But this is so unfortunate.

68
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,366
It must've been a tough decision
for Mr. Doh Jinwoo.

69
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,077
We wasted his precious lung like this.

70
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,336
EPISODE 12

71
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,923
A little more.

72
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:00,800
Keep blowing.

73
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:05,096
A little more. Good.

74
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,518
Overall, your pulmonary function is

75
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:13,229
about twice as higher

76
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:15,148
as an ordinary male in his 20s.

77
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:18,401
You won't have a problem
carrying out your daily life

78
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,695
without your right lower lobe
with numbers like these.

79
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,741
However, look right here.

80
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:27,869
You once suffered from tuberculosis.

81
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:30,580
That's why the lung we actually use

82
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:33,541
may be much smaller
than what you can see here.

83
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:37,128
But there are two donors,
so there won't be a big problem.

84
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:41,549
What if

85
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:45,470
Ms. Yoon suddenly changes her mind

86
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,514
and decides not to donate her lung?

87
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:50,850
What will happen?

88
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:55,271
She's an egotistic person

89
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:58,358
who'd carelessly use her daughter
for her purpose.

90
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,986
And she said she'd donate her lung

91
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,863
just before the primary election.

92
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:06,616
That's what troubles me.

93
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:10,078
Please promise me.

94
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:13,414
If the worst comes to worst

95
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:16,292
and Ms. Yoon changes her mind,

96
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:19,629
then please cut my left lung
and give it to her.

97
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:20,838
I can't do that.

98
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:23,216
If I cut both your lungs
and transplant them to her,

99
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:25,093
it'll be much more straining on you.

100
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:30,181
You said my pulmonary function is
much better than others.

101
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:31,891
So if I share my half with her--

102
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:33,142
You'll be able to survive.

103
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:36,771
But when the worst happens,

104
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:39,899
you may die on the table.

105
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:45,696
Have you ever lost someone

106
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,241
whom you cherish more than yourself?

107
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:51,994
While Sunae disappeared,

108
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,705
I was unable to run, not even once.

109
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:00,420
Even if I'm unable
to do freerunning again, no.

110
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:03,214
I don't care
even if I'm unable to walk again.

111
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:05,508
So please,
no matter what the situation is,

112
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,510
if Sunae falls in danger during surgery,

113
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:12,181
please cut off the rest of my lungs
and give them to her.

114
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:20,481
-Daewoong, gloves.
-What?

115
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:22,650
Okay.

116
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:24,777
Here.

117
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,371
I need to speak to Dr. Choi.
This is Han Yihan.

118
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,039
<i>Yes, one second.</i>

119
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:40,793
Choi Yosub speaking.

120
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:43,504
Yosub, listen up.

121
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:49,594
Cut the middle lobe
of Mr. Do Jinwoo's right lung.

122
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,263
Sorry? The middle lobe?

123
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:53,639
<i>Dr. Choi Yosub.</i>

124
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,142
Hang up the intercom immediately.

125
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:59,520
Suture the donor's chest
and put an end to the surgery. Otherwise--

126
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:00,897
Wait.

127
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:04,442
If she gets more of Doh Jinwoo's lungs,

128
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,736
she can live.

129
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:08,613
Right?

130
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,781
It's true, but we can't do that.

131
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:14,076
If we attempt a one-on-one lung transplant

132
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:16,954
and something goes wrong with the donor,
we'll be legally responsible--

133
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:20,333
Since when did this hospital
only do things that are allowed?

134
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,044
Don't stop him.

135
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,254
You just said it yourself.

136
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:28,758
The only way to save my daughter is

137
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:31,385
to get both lungs transplanted.

138
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,516
Dr. Choi.

139
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:38,768
<i>Follow Dr. Han's order.</i>

140
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:40,853
<i>I'll take responsibility.</i>

141
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,150
<i>Yosub.</i>

142
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,236
Yes, Yihan.

143
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,904
I rendered the shapes of their lungs

144
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:52,281
and compared the size
of their thoracic ducts.

145
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,283
<i>When I compared the two data,</i>

146
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,868
<i>I saw Doh Jinwoo's right middle lobe is</i>

147
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:58,454
<i>much bigger than
Yang Sunae's left lower lobe.</i>

148
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:02,041
Yang Sunae's left upper lobe
has not become fibrotic.

149
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:05,002
I'll connect Mr. Doh's right middle lobe
with the patient's left lobe.

150
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,713
Sorry? Is that possible?

151
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:08,631
<i>It is.</i>

152
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,800
There was a case reported from Japan.

153
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,718
The shape of their blood vessels

154
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,262
and bronchial tubes are the same.

155
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:15,763
<i>It's anatomically possible.</i>

156
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:17,890
But Yihan,

157
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,018
it's the first time in Korea.

158
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:26,274
It's the first time, and it's dangerous.

159
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:28,693
But it's a way to save Ms. Yang

160
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:31,320
<i>and help Mr. Doh recover the fastest.</i>

161
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:36,117
Trust me, and let's do this.

162
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:40,121
All right.

163
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,492
Room One finished
the extraction of his right middle lobe.

164
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:19,910
Remove her left lower lobe.

165
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,092
Mr. Doh Jinwoo's right middle lobe.

166
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,512
Is this enough?

167
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:39,639
It'll be fine.

168
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:41,390
We're fighting against time now.

169
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:44,644
We must attach and reperfuse this
before her edema becomes serious.

170
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,312
Attach it to the left lung.

171
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:50,316
Forceps.

172
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,321
A little more.

173
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,085
Is it going well?

174
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:12,254
It's not an easy situation,
but it'll be fine.

175
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:14,799
He's a guy who always showed

176
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,969
supernatural strength in times like these.

177
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:24,141
-Suction.
-Suction.

178
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:44,328
Pulmonary arterial pressure, 21.
Oxygen saturation, 100%.

179
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,538
And the right lung?

180
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:48,040
The edema isn't progressing.

181
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,421
Slowly start weaning the pump.

182
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,464
Yes. I'll decrease the drainage.

183
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,383
Pump flow, 70.

184
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:01,512
Wean it some more.

185
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:03,848
Pump flow, 50.

186
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:10,646
Her lungs seem fine.

187
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:11,605
Her vital signs are stable.

188
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,859
Let's stop the pump. Begin the sign.

189
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,694
Pump stop sign.

190
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:19,280
One, two, three.

191
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:20,740
The draining has stopped.

192
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:36,964
Pulmonary arterial pressure, 16.
Oxygen saturation is still at 100%.

193
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,717
I can't… I can't believe this.

194
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,678
That was the first
one-on-one lung transplant in Korea,

195
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,347
and the upper lobe of the receiver
with the middle lobe of the donor.

196
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,683
I can't believe I just witnessed this.

197
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,019
You didn't just witness it.
You were a part of it.

198
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:54,106
The surgery ended safely
thanks to all of you. Great work.

199
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:06,660
I knew it.

200
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,538
I knew Han Yihan could do it.

201
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:16,504
Dr. Han.

202
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,256
He's very cool-headed in court,

203
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,802
but rather humane in operating rooms.

204
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,388
That's who he really is.

205
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:28,682
He's not afraid of anything

206
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,310
if what he does can save a patient.

207
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:15,062
Once Ms. Yang and Mr. Doh
recover their consciousness,

208
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:16,939
I'll transfer them
to New-Hope Medicine Clinic.

209
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:20,150
You'll need more people and equipment.
You should let them--

210
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:22,903
There's enough.
I'm here to support everything.

211
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,949
Also, if we leave the patient
and her guardian here,

212
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,535
who knows what will happen?

213
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,288
I'll keep investigating
the assault and kidnapping of Mr. Doh

214
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,250
and the suspicion of domestic abuse
against your daughter.

215
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:39,920
And there's no settling
in your nullity suit.

216
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,719
Man, I never imagined

217
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:50,389
I would get to do
another surgery with Han Yihan.

218
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:54,727
But he's something, isn't he?

219
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,479
His talent is shaper than ever.

220
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:02,318
That talent is sadly wasted in him.
His great talent.

221
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,777
Man.

222
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,242
It's getting hot.

223
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:13,412
Ms. Jung, what brings you here?

224
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:16,624
May I speak with the two of you?

225
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:20,294
What?

226
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:25,841
Why are you getting all serious?

227
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:30,054
Make it quick.
I'm tired after the long surgery.

228
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:33,098
I want some information

229
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:36,352
on Dr. Han Yihan's trial
from five years ago.

230
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,273
All of a sudden? What about that trial?

231
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,943
There's no need
to hold any secrets back among us.

232
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,028
All three of us were

233
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:50,449
instigated to give false witnesses
by Chairman Gu Jingi.

234
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:58,040
My gosh, man.
What you just said can cause big trouble.

235
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,293
Did you bring us here to talk about this?

236
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:06,382
We're leaving.
I'll consider this never heard.

237
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:09,426
Let's go. What are you doing?

238
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,471
You can go.

239
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:15,015
I'll stay and talk to her.

240
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:17,059
Talk about what?

241
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:21,438
What's going on?
Are you going astray too, Ms. Cho?

242
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:28,988
Okay, sure. Whatever it is,
you two are on your own.

243
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:30,781
I'm out.

244
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:31,865
Goodbye.

245
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,669
What do you want to know?

246
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:45,462
The truth.

247
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:49,800
The truth about Mr. Geum Seokju's surgery
I've been oblivious to.

248
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,447
What was that?
She only made me feel anxious.

249
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:20,664
<i>Judge wisely.</i>

250
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:24,543
The Legal Team at Banseok
might no longer be on your side.

251
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,631
If it all comes down to this,

252
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,843
I must find a way to survive.

253
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:26,939
<i>What's the reason?</i>

254
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:30,567
<i>You discarded the initial contract
which benefitted us</i>

255
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:34,029
<i>and signed another contract
with Banseok at a higher risk.</i>

256
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:37,366
It's simple.
I have more to gain from that.

257
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:40,327
And much more to lose. Terribly more.

258
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:44,206
You always worry about the risk,
whereas I look forward to the return.

259
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:48,001
And that difference is
what made me sit here, not you.

260
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:51,839
Honours Hand's first Korean descent
to become the head of the Asian branch.

261
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:54,842
Sure, until this day,
your recklessness paid off.

262
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,094
<i>But do you think this will continue?</i>

263
00:18:57,177 --> 00:19:01,557
A gambler who only likes to race
cannot sit at the table until the end.

264
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,059
<i>If you want to sit there for a long time,</i>

265
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:07,229
then start doing business
instead of gambling.

266
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:09,773
<i>Thanks for your advice.</i>

267
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,318
I'll take it deep inside my heart.

268
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:15,904
NEW-HOPE LAW OFFICE
NEW-HOPE MEDICINE CLINIC

269
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,364
<i>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.</i>

270
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:20,826
The heart muscle became much bigger,
reducing the size of your ventricles.

271
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:24,872
From now on, you're likely to feel
more discomfort as you breathe.

272
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:29,877
Also, your aorta became quite dilated.

273
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,547
If you leave this as is,
it can become an aortic dissection.

274
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,592
-When should he get the surgery?
-The sooner, the better.

275
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:40,387
If possible, I'd like to postpone this
until after the presidential election.

276
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,431
You must think of this

277
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:46,310
as keeping two ticking time bombs
inside your chest.

278
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:48,645
You won't feel its negative effect now,

279
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,231
but once the bomb goes off,

280
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,151
there's no way to reverse it.

281
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:59,990
Will the debate for his primary election
affect his heart in a bad way?

282
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:02,034
I will prescribe a tranquilizer,

283
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:06,455
but you will be in danger
until you receive the surgery.

284
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,668
I will prepare for the surgery
as soon as the primary election ends.

285
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:14,463
Understood. By the way,

286
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:18,175
if my surgery becomes known to the public,

287
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:23,263
why don't we give Hyunseong's name
as the official surgeon?

288
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,098
Father, what…

289
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:27,100
What do you mean?

290
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:29,978
I am talking about
a hypothetical situation.

291
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:34,441
I hope my surgery stays a secret.
But if words get out,

292
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:37,236
we must consider Banseok's position.

293
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,531
Didn't you end things
with Chairman Gu Jingi?

294
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:45,035
Relationships can't be severed so easily.

295
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:50,791
Please understand the position I am in.

296
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:55,671
Father, you should focus
on the primary debate.

297
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:58,632
I will talk to Yihan
and schedule the surgery.

298
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,051
Okay. Please do that.

299
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,438
GUKKWANG CAPITAL

300
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,607
EARN LIKE A DOG, SPEND LIKE A DOG

301
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,150
CEO GONG GUKKWANG

302
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:25,200
What a smell.

303
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:27,411
It drives me insane.

304
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,871
There are 50 bundles of cash and check.

305
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,039
How long will it take?

306
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,709
The size is considerable.

307
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:37,754
To keep things safe,
it will take about two months.

308
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,256
Finish it in one month.

309
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:43,176
-I will bring 50 more bundles.
-Mr. Kwon.

310
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,304
These days, lending money

311
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:48,974
is harder work than pouring cement
at a construction site in summer.

312
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:50,726
It's completely exhausting.

313
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:54,104
If something goes wrong
with the laundering,

314
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:57,607
will you take responsibility for my life?

315
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:01,737
One month.

316
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,613
The rest is in the car.

317
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:08,910
It seems like the assemblywoman
will become the president.

318
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:11,955
She is receiving so many donations.

319
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:13,707
Don't run your mouth.

320
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,960
If your spittle lands on someone,
your tongue will get pulled out.

321
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:21,798
Your spittle is bound to land on someone
as you live your life.

322
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:25,260
To save your face,

323
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:28,430
I will run the laundry machine

324
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:31,933
until it breaks down.

325
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:42,778
-Take this.
-Yes.

326
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:45,030
-There he is.
-There he is.

327
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:46,573
-I am taking photos.
-That's him, right?

328
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:47,949
Yes. That's him.

329
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:50,994
All right.

330
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:57,501
Is he coming this way?

331
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:58,960
-Is he?
-He is coming this way.

332
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,629
Hide.

333
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:01,922
Hey, lie back.

334
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:04,591
Lying back ruins my hair.

335
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:06,802
Is he gone?

336
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:10,097
Gong Gukkwang is bigger
than I thought he was.

337
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:13,141
You are right. He has ties
with Assemblywoman Yoon's aide.

338
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:16,686
This connects him
to Assemblywoman Yoon too.

339
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:22,234
-Isn't that Gong Gukkwang?
-You are right.

340
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:23,151
He is coming out.

341
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:29,950
They got in a car.

342
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:31,660
Yes. It's a nice car.

343
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,955
They are coming this way. Hide.

344
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:38,041
-I told you to lie back!
-Gosh, my hair will get ruined.

345
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,921
-They are gone, right?
-Where are they going?

346
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:45,674
We will find out once we follow them.

347
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:58,186
PUBLIC SAUNA

348
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,438
WE ARE CLOSED FOR THE DAY

349
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:16,663
Who is that? Take photos.

350
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,714
Gosh, old man.

351
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:28,258
You descended to the earth.

352
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:30,051
Stop talking and come on out.

353
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:32,095
I said I wanted to meet quietly
and you made me come to this place.

354
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:42,105
This place is safe and quiet.

355
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:44,441
The neighborhood is in my hands.

356
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:50,363
Once everything gets bulldozed over
and redeveloped,

357
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:52,115
I will set up

358
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:54,826
the biggest apartment for you.

359
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:56,578
It will be a penthouse.

360
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,414
Stop with your stupid tricks.
I don't need such a thing.

361
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:12,385
-Good work.
-Thank you, boss.

362
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:18,433
-What's this?
-Old man, I am disappointed.

363
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,352
To us, the ox knee soup is like

364
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:22,854
the Oath of the Peach Garden.

365
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:27,359
PROSECUTOR BAEK KANGHO

366
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:39,037
The new prosecutor provides nice service.

367
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:43,208
You even got me food from a restaurant.

368
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:44,709
Enjoy it.

369
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:48,088
You won't be able to eat outside
for the next ten years.

370
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:51,132
What does that mean?

371
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,134
Kidnapping, confinement, special assault,

372
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:55,136
and various financial law violations.

373
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,223
You will eat prison food
for the next ten years.

374
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:00,934
What? Prison food?

375
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:05,647
For goodness' sake!
What nonsense are you spouting?

376
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:09,776
My lawyer told me
that he settled with the victims.

377
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:12,571
Do you know
how much money I spent on that?

378
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:15,448
You are being too noisy.

379
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:19,411
It's only a mitigating circumstance.
It won't make you not guilty.

380
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:23,373
Besides, the price of your crimes
will be determined by me, not your lawyer.

381
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:26,084
For goodness' sake.

382
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:31,339
I should have known when they suddenly put
a different man in charge.

383
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:33,425
Who are you?

384
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:36,761
Why are you doing this to me? Is there

385
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,263
some bad blood between us?

386
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:42,726
It's up to you.

387
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:45,353
You can decide what comes between us.

388
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:56,698
<i>Back then, you acquitted me</i>

389
00:26:57,282 --> 00:27:00,118
in an incredibly neat fashion.

390
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:03,079
That's why I repay you for your kindness.

391
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:05,498
If you want to do that,
lay low for a while.

392
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:08,126
Don't get involved
with Assemblywoman Yoon or Banseok.

393
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:10,754
Why not?

394
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:13,089
Is it because of that lawyer?

395
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:15,091
Stop asking questions and do as I say!

396
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:20,472
Otherwise, you will eat
prison food for years.

397
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:26,353
Even if that happens,

398
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:28,938
I won't eat them alone.

399
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:34,194
PUBLIC SAUNA

400
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:37,864
PUBLIC SAUNA

401
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:43,912
Why does Senior Prosecutor Baek
involve himself

402
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,288
with someone like Gong Gukkwang?

403
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:48,083
I feel like

404
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,627
we witnessed something we shouldn't have.

405
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:58,885
<i>What are you going to do?</i>

406
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:00,720
Your relationship with Gu Jingi is
at its worst,

407
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:02,639
but the stock price keeps rising
for Banseok R and D Center.

408
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:05,517
Don't worry.
Things are going as I planned.

409
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,103
So what exactly is your plan?

410
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:10,980
Helping Mr. Han get his revenge
on Chairman Gu

411
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:12,440
can't be all.

412
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:19,155
Here. It's your turn.

413
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,077
If you think of me as your partner,

414
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,204
you should share your plan.

415
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:29,290
These days, you keep Mr. Han
by your side instead of me

416
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,000
and that makes me jealous.

417
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:34,212
Is that why you keep in contact
with Susie Yoon?

418
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:37,757
Susie… What the… Come on!

419
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:39,759
Why did you distract me like that?

420
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:43,513
Besides, why would I keep in contact
with that control freak?

421
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:45,181
Right?

422
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:48,351
Right. I should have known
that you would do no such thing.

423
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:51,563
Get some practice.

424
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:53,606
Your swing needs work.

425
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,661
<i>It's so beautiful.</i>

426
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,373
I'll wear them
to the inauguration ceremony.

427
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:15,545
Why do you have this?

428
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:16,713
Why do you think?

429
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:19,340
If you're curious, open it and see.

430
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:25,472
-You punk--
-I wonder if you have the guts to do that.

431
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:28,183
Prosecutor Geum Seokyeong
and Mr. Han Yihan

432
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:30,977
who have it out for Banseok are both here.

433
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:35,648
If everyone finds out
that your fiancée is sleeping in there,

434
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:39,694
will you be able to
handle the consequence?

435
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:41,571
Yuna, hold on.

436
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:45,533
I am sorry.

437
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:49,871
But it's quite rude of you to leave
without explaining why you're leaving.

438
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:51,456
You will find out why.

439
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:56,503
I'm sorry that I can't celebrate with you.

440
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:02,175
Did you call for me?

441
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:06,554
Mr. Cheon.

442
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:11,059
I have never asked you
for a personal favor.

443
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:12,185
No.

444
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:16,981
Please install this
in the penthouse elevator.

445
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:20,485
Then should I tell Chairman Gu…

446
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:21,820
Keep it a secret.

447
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:24,572
I will tell him myself
when things become clear.

448
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:27,367
-Yes, sir.
-One more thing.

449
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:30,787
Collect all waste
that comes out of the penthouse.

450
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:33,373
Especially things like hair and nails

451
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:37,126
where drugs can be detected.

452
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:39,128
Yes, sir.

453
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:46,553
Congratulations.
You won't be anyone's woman or wife.

454
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:49,806
You will remain Director Lim Yuna
of Banseok R and D Center.

455
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,933
Thank you for making that happen.

456
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:03,278
The moment Honours Hand becomes
the largest shareholder,

457
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:08,449
I will move the headquarters
to the BioValley in Boston.

458
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,243
Boston.

459
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:13,454
It's the place I miss.

460
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:16,583
Let's go together.

461
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:20,003
After acquiring Banseok R and D Center,

462
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:21,754
I will return to the US.

463
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:25,758
The headquarters promised me
the executive vice president position.

464
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,844
It's an impressive promotion,

465
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:32,265
but one thing troubles my mind.

466
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:34,893
I won't be able to be with you.

467
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:42,066
Come on. Are you proposing to me
without a ring?

468
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:48,448
I told you that I won't propose to you
like Gu Hyunseong did.

469
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:50,700
Please wait a bit longer.

470
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:54,412
My proposal ring will be
Banseok R and D Center.

471
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:05,590
Since people are dissatisfied
with the ruling party,

472
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:08,635
experts predict
that Daehan Party's candidate will win

473
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:09,928
the presidential election.

474
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:12,722
Thus, the first and last primary debate
between the candidates

475
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:15,475
that will air tomorrow is very important.

476
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:17,143
Both candidates
are involved with Gu Jingi,

477
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:19,103
so it will be interesting.

478
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:20,605
Shall we order fried chicken for it?

479
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:22,106
How ironic.

480
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,901
Both of them aren't fit
to become the president.

481
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:27,820
They say you are supposed
to vote for the lesser evil.

482
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:29,781
So what's your plan?

483
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:33,826
Between Lim Taemoon and Yoon Miseon,
which one will you take down first?

484
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:40,416
YOON MISEON, LIM TAEMOON

485
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:46,506
There is nothing wrong.

486
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,717
From now on, you can have a checkup
every six months.

487
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:51,761
Thank you.

488
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:53,972
BAEK KANGHO
ACQUITTED GONG GUKKWANG 5 YEARS AGO

489
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:56,891
So Kangho met up with Gong Gukkwang.

490
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:59,185
We saw it with our own eyes.

491
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:02,146
You aren't very surprised.

492
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,065
Let's keep this among ourselves
for a while.

493
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,818
BAEK KANGHO
ACQUITTED GONG GUKKWANG 5 YEARS AGO

494
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:12,824
GONG GUKKWANG, KWON YOONSEOK

495
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:15,284
Assemblywoman Yoon's aide, Kwon Yoonseok.

496
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,789
He didn't have a suitcase
when he came out.

497
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,666
He left in a different car too.

498
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:24,127
I am sure the car was loaded
with illegal political funds.

499
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:28,006
Gong Gukkwang's nickname is
Laundry Machine.

500
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:29,590
-Laundry Machine?
-Yes.

501
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:32,218
They say he even launders
poop-stained money.

502
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:34,971
He runs a loan shark business
called Gukkwang Capital.

503
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:36,681
So much money pours in.

504
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:39,517
Illegal political funds,
big companies' slush funds…

505
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,185
Even swindlers bring in their profits.

506
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:42,854
He launders the money by lending it.

507
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:46,190
Since the exchange is made in cash,
no records remain.

508
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:48,609
Tracing the serial numbers
doesn't work either.

509
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:51,738
He was under investigation a few times
for financial law violations,

510
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:54,198
but he always got acquitted
or sent away with a fine.

511
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:55,241
Then…

512
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,661
five years ago,
he ended up in a detention center.

513
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:01,080
And Kangho acquitted him.

514
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:05,376
Thanks to that, holding him responsible
for his past crimes became tricky.

515
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,046
He stayed low for about two years.

516
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:10,631
Three years ago, he began
purchasing land in Geumcheon-gu

517
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:11,883
that was up for redevelopment.

518
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:13,843
He took over a construction company
that went under.

519
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:18,139
So he wants to become the CEO
of the construction industry.

520
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,391
It's a textbook example
of an entrepreneurial gang.

521
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:24,062
Shall we issue a subpoena
for Kwon Yoonseok?

522
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:27,815
No. If he makes a suicide attempt
like he did five years ago,

523
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:28,775
we will be back to the beginning.

524
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:31,986
We will need to take a different approach.

525
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:33,946
Different how?

526
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:36,324
A humanistic approach.

527
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:40,995
Mr. Kwon Yoonseok.

528
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:45,792
Thankfully, you look very healthy.

529
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:50,421
Can we talk for a second?

530
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:03,768
The prosecution is investigating

531
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,479
Assemblywoman Yoon's
illegal political funds again.

532
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:10,274
You might be summoned soon.

533
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:15,571
Which decision will you make this time?

534
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:23,412
I will get going now.

535
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:28,167
Live your life this time.

536
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:31,754
You almost died once.

537
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:35,800
Then something ought to change.

538
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:43,224
I am a bit tired these days.

539
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:45,852
I shouldn't appear exhausted on TV.

540
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:49,355
Don't worry, Assemblywoman Yoon.
I will make your skin glow.

541
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,482
I am in your care.

542
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:54,360
Let me get some sleep
during the treatment.

543
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:55,653
Yes, ma'am.

544
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:45,244
<i>We will now begin Daehan Party's
presidential primary debate.</i>

545
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:48,581
As this is the last debate,
I ask both candidates

546
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:52,126
-to wrap up with a fair play.
-Sure.

547
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:55,046
Candidate Yoon, you may speak first.

548
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:59,175
Please ask him a question on any topic
in one minute and 30 seconds.

549
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:03,346
Okay. I will ask right away.

550
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:06,641
Last month, your daughter, Lim Yuna

551
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:11,646
became the director
of a major bio-healthcare center.

552
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:13,773
<i>That's correct.</i>

553
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:17,526
<i>Your daughter is only 34 years old.</i>

554
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:20,446
<i>Doesn't that mean she rode
on her father's coattails?</i>

555
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:22,573
<i>No, it doesn't.</i>

556
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:26,994
My daughter got to where she is
with her capabilities alone.

557
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:30,790
I assure you that she didn't receive
any special treatments

558
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,667
during the process of appointment.

559
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:36,379
A regular 34-year-old in Korea

560
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:39,131
can't even become a manager,
but she became a director of a center.

561
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:43,010
Don't you think that countless youths
who are watching this debate

562
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:46,555
will feel a sense of deprivation?

563
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:47,890
I am not sure.

564
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:51,227
Although you say that,

565
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:53,354
you became

566
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:56,649
the youngest anchor
of a major TV station in your mid-20s.

567
00:37:56,732 --> 00:38:00,403
You didn't receive special treatments
back then, did you?

568
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:01,946
Don't change the subject.

569
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,074
I am asking about your daughter.

570
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:07,868
If my daughter wanted special treatments,

571
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:12,081
she wouldn't have become
a researcher in medical engineering,

572
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:15,251
a field where test results and numbers
are the sole basis of judgment.

573
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:19,422
Please don't see her

574
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:23,426
<i>as the daughter of Lim Taemoon,
a Daehan Party's candidate,</i>

575
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:27,096
<i>but the young woman
who isn't afraid to take risks</i>

576
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:31,892
<i>and became the youngest senior researcher
at BioValley in Boston.</i>

577
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:35,187
That's cool. He met the crisis head-on.

578
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:39,233
<i>This time, Candidate Lim
will be allowed to speak first.</i>

579
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,402
In one minute and 30 seconds,

580
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:43,863
please ask her a question on any topic.

581
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:46,741
Okay. I will ask you a question.

582
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,243
Ms. Yoon. Five years ago,

583
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,662
you were investigated by the prosecution

584
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:54,206
on the suspicion of receiving
illegal political funds.

585
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,667
It's all in the past.

586
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:58,502
It's completely groundless too.

587
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:01,964
Unfortunately, it isn't all in the past.

588
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:06,093
Here are photos…

589
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:10,556
of your aide, Kwon Yoonseok.

590
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,642
He has been your aide for 15 years.

591
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:16,979
This is Gukkwang Capital,

592
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:19,440
<i>a loan shark business
under the guise of a financial business.</i>

593
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:23,110
<i>Why did your aide go there?</i>

594
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:25,154
DAEHAN PARTY'S PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY DEBATE

595
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:28,616
No way. He counterattacked.

596
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:30,242
<i>Please answer.</i>

597
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:33,329
<i>Why did your aide meet up
with a loan shark?</i>

598
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:37,249
<i>Are you admitting
to unlawful surveillance on my employee?</i>

599
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:38,834
<i>Unlawful surveillance?</i>

600
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:42,630
An assemblywoman's aide is
a public figure.

601
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:45,341
Please don't change the subject
and answer the question.

602
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:47,760
I don't know anything about it.

603
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:50,179
After the debate,

604
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:52,681
I will check the matter myself.

605
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:56,435
-That's an evasive answer.
-Candidate Lim, you used up your time.

606
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:58,896
-One more minute, please.
-You used up your time.

607
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:01,232
<i>We will wrap up
the free-answer questions here.</i>

608
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:03,609
What? Come on.
You can't cut them off here!

609
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:05,277
Don't leave me hanging like this!

610
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:10,282
They won't be able to milk it good
if they disclose the scandal in one go.

611
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:13,452
To make it last longer, they must disclose
only a part of it one at a time.

612
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:18,416
Anyway, I can tell this election
will be the biggest scandal yet.

613
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:21,252
<i>-You said you proved your innocence.
-I thought his time was up.</i>

614
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:22,461
<i>But the party members…</i>

615
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:24,880
How much more will you disappoint me?

616
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:29,260
You can have ten home runs, but one
slip-up can end your career in politics.

617
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:32,847
I already gave you a chance to redeem
yourself, but how could you mess up again?

618
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:35,266
I'm sorry.

619
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:38,310
I'll end this as your personal scandal.

620
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:40,563
I'll try to make this go away
as quietly as I can.

621
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:43,441
But if this becomes a bigger problem,

622
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:45,609
you will have to
take responsibility for it.

623
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:51,449
ASSEMBLYWOMAN YOON MISEON

624
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:57,830
My husband and my daughter left me.

625
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,916
You're the only person I can trust

626
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,169
to the end, Yoonseok.

627
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:05,129
You know that, right?

628
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:15,389
Spinning the ball.

629
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:21,937
The game must be boring you.

630
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:26,317
-You…
-I'll make it more fun for you.

631
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:37,661
This got more boring.

632
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:40,873
Have you heard of it?

633
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:43,834
Yes. Once you lose, you keep betting
until you double your loss.

634
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:45,794
But I play it a bit differently.

635
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:49,215
When I lose,
I make sure I win back my loss tenfold.

636
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:51,759
Place your bets now.

637
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:13,489
Next.

638
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:18,661
Place your bets now.

639
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:39,074
Take it. It's yours.

640
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:44,288
What? Why are you giving this to me?

641
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:45,914
Think of it as a deposit

642
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:48,292
for the deal I'm about to offer.

643
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:52,671
There's this Korean saying.

644
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:54,340
"Men must be careful

645
00:43:55,924 --> 00:43:58,093
of three tips."

646
00:43:58,761 --> 00:43:59,970
The tip of their tongue.

647
00:44:00,554 --> 00:44:01,764
Their fingertip.

648
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:03,849
And the last one…

649
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:06,977
I don't have to tell you, right?

650
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,438
But I don't agree.

651
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:13,817
Based on how you utilize the three things,
they can be excellent weapons.

652
00:44:14,693 --> 00:44:16,987
-Weapons?
-I'll buy

653
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:19,907
the tip of your tongue.

654
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:30,000
What do you mean
you won't operate on my father?

655
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:31,293
It's just as I told you.

656
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:34,421
Gu Hyunseong can operate on him
at Banseok University Medical Center.

657
00:44:36,715 --> 00:44:39,093
I'm sorry about what happened. But--

658
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:40,844
He wants me to operate on him,

659
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:43,514
but he will continue
his relationship with Gu Jingi?

660
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:46,433
I don't want to be used like that.

661
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:49,978
And I will never perform surgery
under someone else's name either.

662
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:55,818
Or is there

663
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:59,238
another reason why
your father cannot end his relationship

664
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:01,657
with Gu Jingi?

665
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:10,541
I'll get going then.

666
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:12,543
There is.

667
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:19,258
Like you said, my father can never betray

668
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,510
Chairman Gu Jingi.

669
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:25,973
Is it because of

670
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:28,809
the heart transplant from five years ago?

671
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:33,147
Did your father receive

672
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:36,191
a heart transplant at Banseok
with Gu Jingi's help?

673
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:41,697
My goodness. He loves this drink.

674
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:43,574
It's an honor to serve you.

675
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:47,161
-Let's have a drink.
-Sure.

676
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:49,455
All right.

677
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:54,001
The debate today was very impressive.

678
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:56,837
Personally,
I think you won the debate by a mile.

679
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:00,174
All of us here thought from the get-go

680
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:04,553
that you made a better candidate
to be our president.

681
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:06,388
That's right.

682
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:09,433
To be honest, Assemblywoman Yoon
has nothing but a good image.

683
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:11,059
And there are many rumors about her too.

684
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:12,186
Right.

685
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:20,819
Excuse me.

686
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:28,827
Please excuse me for a while.

687
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:30,162
Sure.

688
00:46:43,258 --> 00:46:46,637
Are you enjoying your meal
with the assemblymen from Daehan Party?

689
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,348
Cut to the chase.

690
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:53,143
Make sure to tell
those assemblymen at the restaurant

691
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:54,770
that they must

692
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:57,856
protect me, Gu Jingi,
at the hearing in two days.

693
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,775
<i>If I ask for such favor</i>

694
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:03,111
and if people were to find out later…

695
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:06,824
The living authority never gets inspected.

696
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:08,992
<i>So please</i>

697
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:10,619
become the president.

698
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:12,913
For you and me, both. No.

699
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:15,958
For your own good.

700
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:18,293
Okay.

701
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:27,135
<i>That's right.</i>

702
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:29,513
My father secretly had

703
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:33,350
a heart transplant at the Banseok
Foundation's hospital five years ago.

704
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:37,145
November 21st, at dawn.

705
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:39,982
Is that when

706
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:42,109
he had the surgery at Banseokwon?

707
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:44,278
No.

708
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:46,864
He didn't get the surgery in Korea.

709
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:49,074
It wasn't in Korea?

710
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:51,076
Where did he get the surgery then?

711
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:55,080
It was at a hospital in California.
The one Banseok acquired.

712
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:57,958
As he kept a tight lid on the surgery,

713
00:47:58,542 --> 00:47:59,960
no one found out.

714
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:02,588
-Are you sure?
-Of course.

715
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:05,966
I waited for him in front of the OR
with my mother that day.

716
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:10,095
Why are you asking me this?

717
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:18,145
I'll be honest with you.

718
00:48:18,854 --> 00:48:20,564
I thought

719
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:23,817
Gu Jingi illegally acquired the heart

720
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:27,404
your father received five years ago.

721
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:29,990
What?

722
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:41,668
Did you think

723
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:45,422
my father was backing Gu Jingi
and couldn't end his ties with him

724
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:48,383
because my father illegally received
a heart transplant through him?

725
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:50,260
If not that,

726
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:54,723
is there another reason why
he can't let go of Gu Jingi?

727
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:06,276
Goodness. Are you all right?

728
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:10,405
Where…

729
00:49:14,826 --> 00:49:16,453
Gosh, I'm sorry.

730
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:19,957
It's been a while since I had a drink.
So I'm a bit tired.

731
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:23,085
You must be exhausted
from the debate today.

732
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:25,921
I'm afraid we might have drained
your energy even more.

733
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:27,506
Gosh, no.

734
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:30,550
We rarely get a chance to do this.
Why don't we have another drink?

735
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:32,344
Sure.

736
00:49:36,848 --> 00:49:37,849
All right.

737
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:40,352
This is great.

738
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:53,490
He has Alzheimer's.

739
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,661
He's been taking the new Alzheimer's drug
of the R and D Center

740
00:49:57,786 --> 00:49:59,746
since the initial stage
of its development.

741
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,748
Only two people know this in this world.

742
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:03,834
Me and Chairman Gu.

743
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:07,671
What do you think
the biggest weakness of a politician is?

744
00:50:08,463 --> 00:50:10,799
The children? Bribery?

745
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:13,135
A heart that can explode at any minute?

746
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:15,971
It's none of the above.

747
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:19,474
People would rather vote for a criminal.

748
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:22,477
They can't vote for an old man
who has Alzheimer's.

749
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:27,816
Is Yuna

750
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:30,193
meeting with Dr. Han?

751
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:33,530
Yes. The way they were
looking at each other was a bit off.

752
00:50:33,613 --> 00:50:35,157
So I had a bodyguard follow her.

753
00:50:35,782 --> 00:50:37,367
It's just the two of them

754
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:40,871
at your favorite wine bar of Sky Lounge.

755
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:42,789
What should I do?

756
00:50:44,249 --> 00:50:45,667
What's there to do?

757
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:48,837
They're working together.
A meeting sounds perfectly fine.

758
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:52,299
Aren't you too cool about it?
It's just the two of them at late night.

759
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:55,135
You know? They aren't having a meal.
They are drinking.

760
00:50:55,802 --> 00:50:57,137
I don't care.

761
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:59,222
My queen on my chessboard

762
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:02,142
is better when she's freer.

763
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:08,482
Keep it a secret for the time being.

764
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:11,777
Even Jayden doesn't know
my father has Alzheimer's.

765
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:14,571
So keep it a secret
from Prosecutor Geum too.

766
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:16,907
To be honest,

767
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:19,743
I don't want my father
to become the president.

768
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:23,497
Incompetent children want
their parents to be powerful.

769
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:25,791
But to me, it's a shackle.

770
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:29,753
I'm sure Jayden thinks otherwise.

771
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:33,215
I won't do what he wants
just because I love him.

772
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:37,636
We are more than capable of succeeding
without my father's stature.

773
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:40,305
I'll handle this matter.

774
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:42,599
This is about my father.

775
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:45,352
I don't want someone else
to take care of this.

776
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:00,158
This is Han Yihan speaking.

777
00:52:00,408 --> 00:52:02,577
<i>-This is Kwon Yoonseok.</i>
-Hello.

778
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:06,873
You told me to live my own life
since I got a second chance at life.

779
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:12,921
Please come to the address
in the message. You must be alone.

780
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:16,716
<i>I will get going now.</i>

781
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:20,554
Live your life this time.

782
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:25,684
You almost died once.

783
00:52:25,767 --> 00:52:29,521
Then something ought to change.

784
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:34,568
If I were

785
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:38,280
to have another knife lodged in me,

786
00:52:39,072 --> 00:52:41,575
will you save me again?

787
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:47,455
So you want to make
the same decision as before?

788
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:51,334
I will save you.

789
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,128
Why?

790
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:57,883
I think I'm doing a lousy job
with the new life you gave me.

791
00:52:57,966 --> 00:52:59,551
I don't care about that.

792
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:02,345
Why? I have information
that you want to know?

793
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,515
Whatever condition you are in,

794
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,810
as long as you're my patient,

795
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:11,188
I'll do my best to save you
as many times as it takes.

796
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:14,274
As a doctor.

797
00:53:56,524 --> 00:53:57,692
Is this a trap?

798
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:22,629
Mr. Kwon Yoonseok.

799
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:30,720
Mr. Kwon Yoonseok!

800
00:56:37,018 --> 00:56:38,019
Mr. Kwon!

801
00:56:39,687 --> 00:56:40,772
Mr. Kwon!

802
00:56:45,318 --> 00:56:46,361
Mr. Kwon.

803
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:13,972
Mr. Kwon, can you hear me?

804
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:53,136
Was this really your decision?

805
00:57:54,345 --> 00:57:55,680
I don't care.

806
00:57:56,806 --> 00:57:58,558
I'll continue to save you.

807
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:07,984
<i>You've reached the 911 situation room.
How may I help you?</i>

808
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:09,444
I have an emergency patient.

809
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:11,488
He has carbon monoxide poisoning.

810
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:13,072
<i>Is the patient conscious?</i>

811
00:58:13,406 --> 00:58:15,158
<i>We'll dispatch a unit.
Tell me your address.</i>

812
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:18,703
Jeungdong-ri, Yangseo-myeon,
Yangpyeong-gun…

813
00:58:26,377 --> 00:58:28,671
<i>Hello? Sir?</i>

814
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:32,008
<i>Is something wrong?</i>

815
00:59:14,842 --> 00:59:15,927
Back off, everyone!

816
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:18,429
<i>What about the patient?</i>

817
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:20,390
<i>There's no pulse.
It might be a cardiac arrest.</i>

818
00:59:20,473 --> 00:59:21,724
Thank you, Yoonseok.

819
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:24,227
I need you to do something for me.

820
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:26,312
Lee Dohyung, what are you doing here?

821
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:27,605
<i>I'm about to take the fall for everything.</i>

822
00:59:27,689 --> 00:59:29,232
So I wanted you to represent me.

823
00:59:29,315 --> 00:59:30,942
If you do one thing for me,

824
00:59:31,025 --> 00:59:33,903
I can destroy Gu Jingi for good.

825
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:36,531
<i>When the hearing starts tomorrow,
the price will skyrocket.</i>

826
00:59:36,614 --> 00:59:38,992
And when it does, short sell the stocks.

827
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:40,493
Isn't that too risky?

828
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:43,288
It's not the time to get scared right now.
It's time to go all-in.

829
00:59:43,371 --> 00:59:46,082
<i>-"I solemnly swear…"
-Today's hearing will be your last chance</i>

830
00:59:46,165 --> 00:59:49,335
to tell the truth and seek forgiveness.

831
00:59:56,509 --> 00:59:58,511
