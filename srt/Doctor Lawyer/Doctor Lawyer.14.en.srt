1
00:00:00,875 --> 00:00:04,879
THE NAMES OF PEOPLE, INCIDENTS, AND
BACKGROUNDS OF THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:06,798
GU JINGI, CANDIDATE
FOR MINISTER OF HEALTH AND WELFARE

3
00:00:06,881 --> 00:00:08,550
My knight…

4
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:11,553
finally got the king.

5
00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:13,930
<i>Don't you know what I did for you?</i>

6
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,558
<i>How dare you do this to me?</i>

7
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:17,934
<i>Sir!</i>

8
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:28,069
Candidate, what is this video?

9
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:31,072
Who are you stabbing?

10
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:32,282
NO TAEHYUN, CHOI SEUNGJUN, JEON DONGSEOK

11
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:33,324
CHAIRMAN OF THE HEARING

12
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:38,413
It's Lee Dohyung, the assistant director
of Banseok University Medical Center.

13
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:45,170
The man who got stabbed in the neck
by Gu Jingi

14
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:47,714
was a witness to this hearing.

15
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:52,761
He is Lee Dohyung, the assistant director
of Banseok University Medical Center.

16
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:08,193
HEARING FOR GU JINGI,
MINISTER OF HEALTH AND WELFARE CANDIDATE

17
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:17,285
ONE DAY BEFORE
GU JINGI'S CONFIRMATION HEARING

18
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:18,286
NEW-HOPE LAW OFFICE
NEW-HOPE MEDICINE CLINIC

19
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:20,830
Was it Gu Jingi's order?

20
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:24,084
Did he make you find out
about Kwon Yoonseok's condition?

21
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,380
You don't have to answer me.

22
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:30,965
I can ask Gu Jingi myself.

23
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:33,927
Don't do that. Fine.

24
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:36,429
You're right.

25
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:38,431
Chairman Gu told me

26
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,518
to find out if Kwon Yoonseok
can recover in any way.

27
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:48,316
Go tell Gu Jingi

28
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,401
that Kwon Yoonseok is brain dead.

29
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,196
Don't tell him that you were caught.

30
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,697
Tell him he's brain dead?

31
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,950
That way, he'll trust you even more.

32
00:01:57,283 --> 00:02:00,703
And meet him tomorrow
before he attends his hearing

33
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:04,124
to ask about that night five years ago.

34
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:12,507
And? Then what?

35
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,384
Just ask him. That's all.

36
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,928
Let me know where you two will meet.

37
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:27,981
As you already know, Gu Jingi is a man

38
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:31,526
who always betrays before he's betrayed.

39
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,029
Dr. Lee Dohyung.

40
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,616
Don't get framed
for other people's crimes.

41
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:41,661
Just be punished for what you did.

42
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:45,623
It's a piece of advice
as an attorney and your junior.

43
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:54,257
NEW-HOPE LAW OFFICE
NEW-HOPE MEDICINE CLINIC

44
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,137
What he said isn't wrong.

45
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,850
Assistant Director Lee Dohyung.

46
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:05,602
Hello.

47
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:09,772
Have you thought about my offer?

48
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:12,567
I didn't get a minute of sleep last night.

49
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,068
I mean, ten billion won?

50
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:17,655
My offer still stands.

51
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,034
Aren't you with Dr. Han Yihan?

52
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:22,452
Why did you tell me to ignore you?

53
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,621
At times, I have to fool my own team

54
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,999
to carry out a perfect plan.

55
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:31,586
It's simple.

56
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,797
We will ruin Gu Jingi to get our freedom,

57
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,966
and you will get ten billion won as well.

58
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:46,226
EPISODE 14

59
00:03:58,112 --> 00:03:59,572
I will get my freedom

60
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,075
and ten billion won too.

61
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:08,790
CHAIRMAN GU JINGI

62
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:10,208
My gosh, he surprised me.

63
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,626
CHAIRMAN GU JINGI

64
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:13,169
It's such odd timing.

65
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:17,131
Yes, sir. This is Lee Dohyung.

66
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,300
Are you ready to appear as a witness?

67
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,261
Yes, I'm ready.

68
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:22,679
But--

69
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,138
Before you go there,

70
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:26,516
I need you to help me one more time.

71
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,977
<i>Tell Ms. Cho and Ms. Jung to come</i>

72
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,271
<i>to the assistant director's office now.</i>

73
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:34,190
Tell them you need to discuss something
as my witness.

74
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,192
Yes, and then what?

75
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,069
Contact the head of the Security Team

76
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,238
and come to my spot
in the underground parking lot.

77
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:42,282
<i>I'll be waiting there.</i>

78
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:46,077
Why? Is that too hard to do?

79
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,038
No.

80
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:53,710
I'll do as you say.

81
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,420
I'll see you soon.

82
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,721
Well. Things worked out by themselves.

83
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:10,727
<i>I'm to meet Chairman Gu Jingi.</i>

84
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,104
I'll see him
at his parking spot in Banseokwon.

85
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:14,314
I'll bring it up then.

86
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:17,358
Don't overdo it.
You might get yourself in trouble.

87
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,403
It feels uncanny

88
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,072
to have you worried about me.

89
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:24,699
<i>I'll call you later.</i>

90
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,665
THREE HOURS BEFORE
GU JINGI'S CONFIRMATION HEARING

91
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:37,754
Hi.

92
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:41,549
I kept them in the room as you instructed,
Chairman Gu. I mean, Minister Gu.

93
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,469
-Good work.
-It was my pleasure.

94
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:46,637
You promised to make me the director
of Banseok University Medical Center.

95
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,765
Mr. Cheon, get in the car.

96
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:49,891
Yes, sir.

97
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:54,062
Yes.

98
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,939
Yes. You will be the director of Banseok
University Medical Center from now on.

99
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,734
I will protect
your medical license as well.

100
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:02,570
Thank you. Thank you so much, Minister Gu.

101
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,156
Thank you.

102
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,116
Sir.

103
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:09,202
What is it?

104
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:11,412
I mean,

105
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,917
I thought I should know this
before I attend the hearing as a witness.

106
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,878
What is it?

107
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:20,380
Well…

108
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:24,217
That incident in Banseokwon
five years ago.

109
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:27,303
-Sure.
-Who was the VIP

110
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,930
that received
the heart transplant surgery?

111
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:32,183
I mean,

112
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:36,729
I couldn't dare to ask until now,
but I've always had a question.

113
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,899
I mean, who could it have been

114
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:43,736
for you to take such a drastic measure
to find the person a heart?

115
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,864
You suddenly wanted to know that?

116
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:52,370
Come to think about it,
we've known each other for a long time.

117
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:55,998
We've worked together

118
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,251
ever since you became an anesthesiologist.

119
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,002
About 20 years now.

120
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:01,629
I see, 20 years.

121
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:03,047
What a long time.

122
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,932
I left you by my side
for such a long time,

123
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,519
but you can never tell
what's on someone's mind.

124
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,563
Sorry?

125
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,484
No, wait.

126
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,283
It looks like
you got an irresistible offer.

127
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:32,702
-I didn't think--
-This is nothing.

128
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,454
-Let go!
-Chairman Gu, it's not--

129
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:50,094
Please spare me.

130
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:55,558
Don't you know what I did for you?

131
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,853
-How dare you do this to me?
-Sir!

132
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,023
Why…

133
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:15,661
Keep it safe
until the confirmation hearing is over.

134
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:19,665
What should I do?

135
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:22,168
We're at the hospital,
so he'll survive once we move him up.

136
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:25,505
Do you know what I regret the most?

137
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:27,924
Five years ago in the detention center,

138
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,344
letting Han Yihan go alive.

139
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:34,347
If I took care of him as you suggested,

140
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:36,349
I wouldn't have been annoyed like this.

141
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:38,893
Deal with him.

142
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:42,104
-And keep this place off-limits.
-Yes, sir.

143
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,440
I am…

144
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:47,944
sick and tired of this.

145
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:49,904
Why does everyone…

146
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,201
annoy me like this?

147
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,251
CANDIDATE FOR OFFICE

148
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:10,925
CHAIRMAN OF THE HEARING

149
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:12,969
WITNESS, CANDIDATE FOR OFFICE

150
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:23,896
Ms. Cho.

151
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,232
What's going on?

152
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:29,443
Did he really kill him?

153
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,238
Why won't he pick up?

154
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:39,787
Move aside.

155
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,455
No, I'm told to keep you two safe--

156
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:43,708
Do you still not get it?

157
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,877
Chairman Gu Jingi is finished.

158
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,963
If you don't want to end with him,

159
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:52,341
give me my phone back and move aside.

160
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:06,647
If I short sold that at the maximum price
just as you said,

161
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:09,400
<i>I would have made over 50%
in today's trade.</i>

162
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,235
It's not just 50%.

163
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,362
It'll plummet for the next few days.

164
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:17,700
We would have made
over 80% of the shorted price.

165
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,453
Thanks a lot.
Thanks to your useless meddling,

166
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:23,331
we lost our chance to make
tens of millions of dollars.

167
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:26,917
I'll make an official request
to have you disciplined over this matter.

168
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:28,336
All of our conversations

169
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,463
are already recorded.

170
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:31,839
You!

171
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,143
Why did you kill him?

172
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:45,436
CANDIDATE FOR OFFICE

173
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,022
All he did was ask you about Seokju.

174
00:10:58,783 --> 00:10:59,825
Gu Jingi.

175
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:03,663
You're under arrest
for the murder of Lee Dohyung.

176
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,123
You may choose to remain silent,

177
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,334
and you have the right to an attorney.

178
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:11,796
Although it'll be useless.

179
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:26,894
We must take the suspect away.
Please move aside.

180
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:29,230
-Move aside!
-Please move.

181
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:43,077
CANDIDATE FOR OFFICE

182
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,162
-He's coming!
-Say something!

183
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,915
-Did Mr. Lee Dohyung die?
-Do you admit?

184
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:50,209
-Any words on the video?
-Please say something!

185
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:52,461
-A word, please.
-What happened in the video?

186
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,922
-Did Mr. Lee die?
-Say something!

187
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:56,132
Can you explain how you got a heart

188
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,592
for a VIP patient
at Banseokwon five years ago?

189
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:01,011
-Say something!
-Do you admit?

190
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:03,889
-Do you admit to your charges?
-Did he die?

191
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,307
Say something!

192
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:09,854
We're both on our own from now on.

193
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:14,567
-Did he die?
-Anything to say?

194
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,194
-Do you admit to your charge?
-What happened?

195
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:20,072
How…

196
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:24,118
How can he kill a man?

197
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:25,661
It makes no sense.

198
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,497
Ms. Pyo, you know, don't you?

199
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,917
Why did my husband hurt
Assistant Director Lee Dohyung?

200
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,837
And what's this
about taking out a patient's heart?

201
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,465
I don't know.

202
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:39,884
You can't just say you don't know
in this situation.

203
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:43,012
I need to know what's going on
before I can take a measure!

204
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,182
I heard about his plan
to stop other witnesses

205
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:50,352
from attending his confirmation hearing
by using Assistant Director Lee Dohyung.

206
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,104
But he didn't tell me anything else.

207
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:56,942
I think he gave a separate order
to Mr. Cheon Hyungu.

208
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,277
Mr. Cheon?

209
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,988
Where is he? Bring him in right now.

210
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:05,117
Well, I haven't been able to reach him
after Chairman Gu was arrested.

211
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:07,745
The police are looking for him too.

212
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,957
Hyunseong, is there anything you know?

213
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,293
He didn't say anything to me either.

214
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:17,880
What on earth have you all done
while I was gone?

215
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,764
I'm sorry, Boss. Forgive me.

216
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,058
"Boss?"

217
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,684
Do you still call me that

218
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,937
after deciding not to follow my order?

219
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:37,316
I was going to, but at that moment,
Susie Yoon called.

220
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:38,859
Yes, I'm sure you were torn.

221
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:40,945
That's why I gave you another chance.

222
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:44,782
Yet you chose to betray me to the end.

223
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,787
You're right. Everything was my mistake.

224
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:53,624
I'll own up to everything,
so please give me just one more chance.

225
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:57,002
You know that I've done
everything you told me until this day.

226
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,258
I'll give you one last chance.

227
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:06,554
Bring me 50 billion won.

228
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,141
-What?
-You lost me a chance

229
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,143
to make at least tens of billions.

230
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:16,605
Do you think your apology was
worth that much?

231
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,234
I forgive you for your betrayal.

232
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:21,527
But you must make up

233
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,405
for my loss with money.

234
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,782
Bring me 50 billion in three days.

235
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,076
If you can't,
don't ever let me see you again.

236
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:44,967
GU JINGI ARRESTED FOR SUSPICION OF MURDER

237
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:51,473
Thanks.

238
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:56,020
<i>Congratulations.
You're the presidential candidate.</i>

239
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:57,813
<i>You won't have to worry
about the primaries.</i>

240
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:00,566
Do end your relationship with Chairman Gu.

241
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:03,152
All of us at Honours Hand will provide you

242
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,696
with even more active support.

243
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,117
Okay.

244
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:12,578
Let's talk again later.

245
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:27,259
<i>I thought I should know this
before I attend the hearing as a witness.</i>

246
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:30,012
<i>That incident in Banseokwon
five years ago.</i>

247
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:33,057
<i>Who was the VIP that received
the heart transplant surgery?</i>

248
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:34,642
<i>What a long time.</i>

249
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,394
<i>Come to think about it--</i>

250
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,799
I think I found it. Come here.

251
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,975
Look at Gu Jingi's eyes.

252
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:18,852
He's looking at Lee Do-hyung's chest
instead of his face.

253
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,062
His chest?

254
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,855
Is he looking at his fountain pen?

255
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,107
I think so.

256
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,861
He continues to look at the fountain pen,

257
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,657
-then he takes it.
-Yes.

258
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:34,827
After that,

259
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:39,039
when Lee Dohyung tries to take it back,
he stabs him in the neck.

260
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,250
The fountain pen.

261
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:46,714
Wait, maybe it's that thing.
A fountain pen camera.

262
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:49,508
Some reporters use it in secret
while covering a case,

263
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,510
although they shouldn't.

264
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:55,055
He found the fountain pen camera

265
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:57,266
and stabbed him abruptly.

266
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,102
He must've been stressed out
right before his hearing.

267
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:02,604
But still, how can he kill a man?

268
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,982
He was once a respected doctor,

269
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,109
but he has hit the rock bottom.

270
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:17,077
Chairman Gu, from now on,

271
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:20,289
you must share everything with me
without hiding anything.

272
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:23,083
That's the only way I can keep you safe.

273
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,295
Did Nam Hyukchul kill Park Kitae

274
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,672
because of your order?

275
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:32,676
You're right. It was my order.

276
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:34,511
What's the reason?

277
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:37,014
I told him to bear false witness
in Geum Seokju's case

278
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:39,975
five years ago,

279
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:43,020
and he tried to share that in court.

280
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:46,398
That's the only reason why you killed him?

281
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:51,070
By any chance, does this have
anything to do with taking out

282
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:54,948
someone's heart five years ago,
just as Assistant Director Lee said?

283
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,116
That's nonsense.

284
00:17:56,742 --> 00:18:00,245
I wouldn't do something that ridiculous.

285
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,044
I'll spend the rest of my life in prison

286
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:10,214
because of my charges of murder
and murder instigation.

287
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:13,258
So you don't need to know anything else.

288
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:16,011
You didn't prepare a weapon beforehand.

289
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,138
You can find a way

290
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:20,849
to reduce your sentence
to involuntary manslaughter.

291
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,894
If Mr. Cheon cooperates
with the murder instigation,

292
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:25,479
you'll find a way out of that too.

293
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:26,897
No.

294
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:30,067
Your job isn't to protect me.

295
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,153
It's to save Banseok.

296
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,822
-But--
-Ms. Pyo.

297
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,491
I'll take all flaws of Banseok

298
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:39,952
with me and go down.

299
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:43,914
So you must not focus on protecting me.

300
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,583
Focus on protecting my family and Banseok.

301
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:50,921
Protect them from Jayden and Honours Hand.

302
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:58,637
Give me an answer.

303
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,348
This is my final request.

304
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:05,394
Yes, sir.

305
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:24,163
How could he hide the body
in the morgue of his hospital?

306
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,290
He probably hid him here to buy time

307
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,626
before he actually
takes care of him later.

308
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,880
Did you find the fountain pen
he used as a weapon?

309
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:35,841
No, I think Cheon Hyungu took it.

310
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:38,719
The police are looking for him,
so he'll be caught soon.

311
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,222
Where's his guardian? Nobody is here yet?

312
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:43,765
I don't think anyone will come.

313
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,267
He's separated from his wife,

314
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:48,061
and their children are still teenagers,
so she can't show him to them.

315
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,606
Let's move him to the NFS for an autopsy.

316
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:56,778
<i>What?</i>

317
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,907
There was a hidden camera
on the fountain pen he used as a weapon?

318
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,241
Yes.

319
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:05,412
I think Lee Dohyung got caught
trying to record their conversation.

320
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,539
That's why Gu Jingi…

321
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:09,708
Why did Lee Dohyung do that?

322
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:13,545
Why did he take such a big risk

323
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:15,797
to film their conversation?

324
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,592
What if someone put him up for it?

325
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,678
Someone might have told him
to film their conversation

326
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:24,765
for something irresistible
so that Lee Dohyung will risk himself.

327
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:30,646
I'll get going.

328
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:35,400
I only have less than a day
to hold Yoon Miseon under custody.

329
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:40,739
Right. If she got a heart transplant,

330
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:43,617
she'll need a daily dose
of immunodepressants and antibiotics.

331
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:47,663
So find out the drugs she took
between yesterday and today.

332
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,498
Okay, I'll check.

333
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,061
<i>What if someone put him up for it?</i>

334
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:13,897
<i>Someone might have told him
to film their conversation</i>

335
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,900
<i>for something irresistible
so that Lee Dohyung will risk himself.</i>

336
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,235
YOON MISEON

337
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:32,708
It's my resignation letter.

338
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,501
Please process it anytime.

339
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:36,044
Sure.

340
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:41,258
A prosecutor confessed to using
coercive measures before the public.

341
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:42,968
Of course, you should resign.

342
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:44,636
I am sorry.

343
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,847
You punk, why did you do that?

344
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,974
I have known you for years.

345
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:50,517
I know you aren't like that.

346
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,020
You don't receive bribes
or special treatments.

347
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:54,229
What was the reason?

348
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,231
I don't know.

349
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:58,483
I must have been insane back then.

350
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:01,445
For goodness' sake. Give me a break.

351
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:05,449
I will wrap things up
as a proper prosecutor.

352
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:11,413
It took a long time.

353
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:15,000
We should have met like this
five years ago.

354
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,543
Unbelievable.

355
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:18,545
How dare you arrest me,

356
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:21,631
a presidential primary candidate
over a fabricated ledger?

357
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:23,508
Listen carefully.

358
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,093
<i>Once I get out of here,</i>

359
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,971
I will cut off your pretty neck first.

360
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:32,809
Go right ahead
if you manage to get out of here.

361
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:47,699
I warned you to lay low for a while.

362
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:53,455
I couldn't do that.
It wasn't a meager amount.

363
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:55,624
Hundreds of billions were at stake.

364
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,627
What's the use of money?
If you're jailed for attempted murder,

365
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:59,961
you'll be there until you're 60.

366
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,757
That's why

367
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,343
you should help me, prosecutor.

368
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:09,388
Did you forget about
the Oath of the Peach Garden?

369
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:12,307
The Oath of the Peach Garden? It's over.

370
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,351
I just turned in my resignation letter.

371
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,104
Resignation letter? Why so suddenly?

372
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:18,563
You don't need to know.

373
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:22,651
And the person you trust as much as me,
Assemblywoman Yoon Miseon,

374
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,319
got arrested and detained yesterday

375
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,655
for abetting murder.

376
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:31,910
If you don't trust me,
call your lawyer and check.

377
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,037
But I am not sure if she will pick up.

378
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:42,462
What's the password?

379
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:44,297
Daejun Construction, 500 million won.

380
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:45,841
Samhong Distribution, 400 million.

381
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:48,343
Jinhang Transportation, 600 million, and…

382
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:52,013
Banseok Foundation, 700 million.

383
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:56,268
300 million, 200 million,
1.3 billion, 21 billion.

384
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,147
The total is 4.6 billion won.

385
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:03,692
My aide had no fear, didn't he?

386
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:06,445
He collected slush funds for himself

387
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:08,280
by using my name.

388
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:10,574
Sure. Let's leave it at that.

389
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:18,373
You got this drug administered
twice a week without fail.

390
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,001
Don't you remember what it is?

391
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:22,502
What's that?

392
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:24,337
I have no idea.

393
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:26,465
I knew you would react that way,

394
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,884
<i>so I prepared evidence.</i>

395
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,095
<i>I am a bit tired these days.</i>

396
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:34,598
<i>I shouldn't appear exhausted on TV.</i>

397
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:38,101
<i>Don't worry, Assemblywoman Yoon.
I will make your skin glow.</i>

398
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,769
I am in your care.

399
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:42,272
<i>Let me get some sleep
during the treatment.</i>

400
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:44,191
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

401
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:48,945
Who recorded this?

402
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:51,781
A third party's recording
can't be used as evidence.

403
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:52,908
It wasn't a third party.

404
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:56,077
It was a Banseokwon employee
who was there with her.

405
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:59,414
If needed, she will testify in court too.

406
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:01,583
Give me a break.

407
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:04,544
Do you think something so small like this
will bring me down?

408
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:08,006
<i>Every politician
who has worked as long as I did</i>

409
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:12,135
has such faults, okay?

410
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:15,555
You are right.
That's the thing with wrongdoings.

411
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:17,724
They begin as tiny specks of dirt.

412
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,936
I am the one who collects them.

413
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:24,481
But when I began collecting them,
I realized that your wrongdoings are

414
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:27,609
as big as a mountain.

415
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:42,040
Assemblywoman Yoon?
What are you doing here?

416
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:43,124
Do you believe me now?

417
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,210
No one has your back.

418
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,673
Assemblywoman Yoon,
tell me that he is wrong.

419
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:52,801
You are a presidential primary candidate,
so you can handle this.

420
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,970
Stop talking nonsense.

421
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:57,138
I don't even know who you are.

422
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,849
Are you kidding me?

423
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,017
I came this far

424
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,602
<i>because I trusted you!</i>

425
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:05,397
Investigate him thoroughly and find out

426
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:08,483
what Kwon Yoonseok did with my name.

427
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:11,987
I can't believe this woman.

428
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,989
You have a knack
for making people go insane.

429
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:16,074
"Woman?"

430
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:18,702
How dare a thug like you call me that?

431
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:21,830
That's right. I am a thug,
so I will be comfortable in prison.

432
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:24,499
But would you be okay with that,
Assemblywoman Yoon?

433
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:27,877
The harsh wind in prison
won't be good for your skin.

434
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:30,255
Your skin will shrivel up
like dried radish.

435
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:32,966
Calm down.

436
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,844
<i>I will find out</i>

437
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:38,513
which one of you is telling the truth

438
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:42,309
so that no one feels victimized.

439
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,902
You helped me in the end.

440
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:55,196
Why were you like that before the hearing?

441
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:57,907
Did you want me to hate you?

442
00:26:58,491 --> 00:27:02,495
Five years ago, I truly believed
that Han Yihan killed Seokju.

443
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:05,749
But when you began to investigate
Park Kitae and Nam Hyukchul

444
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:08,293
and Gu Jingi asked
for my cooperation again,

445
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:09,628
I realized it then.

446
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:12,631
I had helped Gu Jingi entrap Han Yihan.

447
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:14,132
If you knew, why--

448
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:15,050
I just…

449
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:16,843
couldn't admit it.

450
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:21,222
What I had done for you five years ago
made you struggle more.

451
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:24,476
Han Yihan told me

452
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,978
that you trusted me until the end

453
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:31,483
and that the hearing was my last chance
to live up to your trust.

454
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,402
That was why I testified.

455
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:39,366
Thanks to Han Yihan, I got to wrap up

456
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:42,077
as a proper prosecutor.

457
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:52,754
<i>An arrest warrant for Assemblywoman Yoon
has been issued.</i>

458
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:56,299
<i>I checked if she is taking any medication,</i>

459
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:57,217
YOON MISEON

460
00:27:57,884 --> 00:27:59,803
<i>but there was nothing
other than supplements.</i>

461
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:03,390
Immunodepressants weren't
among the items she requested either.

462
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:05,475
So it wasn't Yoon Miseon.

463
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:07,185
If you received an organ transplant,

464
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:10,939
failing to take immunodepressants
can put you in danger.

465
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:11,981
YOON MISEON

466
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:14,234
Then we are back to the beginning.

467
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,194
<i>I will investigate Gu Jingi now.</i>

468
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:18,488
<i>No matter what it takes,</i>

469
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:21,199
I will find out

470
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,035
who took Seokju's heart.

471
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:25,662
I will also meet

472
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:30,083
the person who has the highest chance
of requesting Lee Dohyung to take

473
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:32,127
a video of Gu Jingi.

474
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:36,297
LEE DOHYUNG
DECEASED

475
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:38,174
<i>Five years ago.</i>

476
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:42,053
<i>Who was the VIP that received
the heart transplant surgery?</i>

477
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,931
PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY CANDIDATES OF A PARTY

478
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:47,475
<i>I mean, I couldn't dare to ask until now,</i>

479
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:49,602
<i>but I've always had a question.</i>

480
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:51,020
BANSEOK R AND D CENTER
CURRENT STATE OF STOCK

481
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:52,897
The price has been falling for two days.

482
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:55,817
What a surprise.

483
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,570
I didn't know
the price would fall so much.

484
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:01,406
This is the beginning.

485
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:04,576
When you release an article
about withdrawing the application

486
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:06,745
for the new drug for Alzheimer's disease,

487
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:09,956
Banseok R and D Center's stocks
will be trash.

488
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:14,544
Where are you, Doctor Lawyer?

489
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:16,546
We should celebrate our victory.

490
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:18,465
<i>I don't think
it's a cause for celebration.</i>

491
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:23,553
Lee Dohyung's body
has been found in Banseok's morgue.

492
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:25,680
Is that so?

493
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:27,891
That's unfortunate.

494
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:29,851
Let's meet tonight at New-Hope Law Office.

495
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:31,478
I have something to discuss.

496
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:33,980
Okay. See you later.

497
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:44,824
Han Yihan?

498
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:45,992
Yes.

499
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:47,619
He has something to discuss.

500
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:49,204
Something to discuss?

501
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:51,706
You still need him?

502
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:52,999
What do you mean?

503
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:55,293
Gu Jingi got destroyed

504
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:57,504
and Bankseok R and D Center
fell into our hands.

505
00:29:57,587 --> 00:30:01,007
That means you no longer need him, right?

506
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:08,556
CLOSED TEMPORARILY
DUE TO A PERSONAL MATTER

507
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:12,852
What a surprise.

508
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:16,689
I didn't know such a place was hidden
inside the law office.

509
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:20,735
What is it that you want
to discuss with me?

510
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:30,245
Is that the video from the hearing?

511
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:34,249
What about it?

512
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:36,835
The fountain pen
Gu Jingi used to stab Lee Dohyung

513
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:39,754
had a hidden camera.

514
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:43,550
Did you give him

515
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:46,177
that fountain pen?

516
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:57,355
I can't believe she is investigating
the man who killed her brother.

517
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:59,566
Even watching it
from the sidelines is hard.

518
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:01,109
Seriously.

519
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:03,528
But she needs to put an end to it herself

520
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:05,947
to make up for the past.

521
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,658
It angers me. It does.

522
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:21,087
That's right. I gave it to him.

523
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,507
I offered him ten billion won for a video

524
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:27,343
of his conversation with Gu Jingi.

525
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:29,345
Ten billion.

526
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:31,556
Why did you do that?

527
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,225
You knew I would secure
a video separately.

528
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:36,269
If I hadn't offered him money,

529
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:39,731
I highly doubt
he would have moved as we wanted.

530
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:42,108
I am a bit offended.

531
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:46,070
I thought you would be thankful.

532
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,116
Thanks to my work on Lee Dohyung,
you took down someone as big as Gu Jingi

533
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,493
in one go.

534
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:54,704
I would have taken him down without it.

535
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:58,666
Then Lee Dohyung wouldn't have died.

536
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:02,003
I am sure you knew

537
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:05,048
that Gu Jingi would hurt Lee Dohyung

538
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:07,967
if he caught something like that.

539
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:16,142
At Banseok University Medical Center's
morgue,

540
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:18,770
Assistant Director Lee Dohyung's body
was found.

541
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:21,397
You aren't surprised.

542
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:22,690
It happened that way.

543
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,568
I gave an order.

544
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:28,613
Mr. Cheon Hyungu simply followed my order.

545
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,658
Through the medical director
of the detention center,

546
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:34,077
I ordered Nam Hyukchul to kill Park Kitae.

547
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:36,621
I also ordered perjury

548
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:39,707
at your brother's trial five years ago.

549
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,794
And Assemblywoman Yoon's political funds--

550
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:44,420
What are you playing at?

551
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:48,257
Will you take the fall for everything
now that you are caught?

552
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:51,469
What's the matter?
I am admitting all allegations.

553
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,055
Those aren't all.

554
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:58,309
Geum Seokju.

555
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,355
You killed my brother.

556
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:05,191
<i>I drove him</i>

557
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,402
to his death.

558
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:10,697
Is that what you want to say?

559
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,284
I don't understand.

560
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:18,913
Why are you so hung up
on Lee Dohyung's death?

561
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:23,084
Could it be trauma?

562
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,713
For revenge, you drove the man
who used to be your friend,

563
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,424
Park Kitae, to his death.

564
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:37,306
Lee Dohyung was a bad man

565
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,643
who needed to be punished anyway.

566
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,478
He helped Gu Jingi

567
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:44,856
open Geum Seokju's chest
and take out his heart.

568
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:48,943
Don't tell me you believed his clumsy lie

569
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:51,654
about how Gu Jingi did everything.

570
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:55,116
Even if it was a lie,
the truth needs to be revealed in court.

571
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:57,744
No. Had we taken it to court,

572
00:33:57,827 --> 00:33:59,829
he would have received
a slap on the wrist.

573
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,208
Did you want to end your revenge
in such a lackluster way

574
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:08,629
after five years of preparation?

575
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:17,680
Whom did you give it to?

576
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:20,892
Answer me.

577
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:22,477
Who received

578
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:24,854
Seokju's heart?

579
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,148
Prosecutor Geum.

580
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:30,568
Mr. Geum Seokju died
due to medical malpractice.

581
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:34,614
The talk about taking out the heart
and giving it to someone else

582
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:36,866
is Han Yihan's delusion.

583
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:43,539
Why? You admitted all other allegations.

584
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:46,209
Why are you keeping quiet
about my brother's heart?

585
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:48,503
I have nothing else to say.

586
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:50,880
I will plead the Fifth from now on.

587
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:53,007
Please call Ms. Pyo Eunsil, my lawyer.

588
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:57,929
Fine. Do what you want to do.

589
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:02,266
So that the world knows about
what you and Banseok did to my brother,

590
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:05,394
I will unveil the truth until the end and…

591
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:12,819
Prosecutor Geum.

592
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:14,654
-What?
-Hey.

593
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:18,324
-Prosecutor Geum. Are you okay?
-Ma'am.

594
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,785
I am okay.

595
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:22,662
Stay outside.

596
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:29,752
How pitiful.

597
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,797
You have the same hereditary disease

598
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:35,633
as your brother.

599
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:39,720
Your condition will worsen
if you overexert yourself.

600
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:41,264
Get hospitalized for treatments.

601
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,599
It's a doctor's advice.

602
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:53,276
I don't know.

603
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:56,154
It seems

604
00:35:56,863 --> 00:36:00,575
like you want revenge more than me.

605
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,162
What's the reason?

606
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:07,456
It can't be about money.

607
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:10,710
Why are you obsessed
with Banseok and Gu Jingi?

608
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,177
If you are curious, you should find out.

609
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:22,471
I intend to do so.

610
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:25,975
About what happened
between you and Gu Jingi,

611
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:28,853
I'm dying to know.

612
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,815
I guess this is
where we stop working together.

613
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:37,028
I had a lot of fun thanks to you,

614
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,197
Doctor Lawyer.

615
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:43,492
You are a brilliant man
with good judgment,

616
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:46,245
but there is one thing you lack.

617
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,333
You are overly clean.

618
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:53,586
Even when you are seeking revenge
on someone stronger,

619
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:56,088
you hold fast to your beliefs and values.

620
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:59,383
It's a type of arrogance, you know.

621
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:02,053
That's not how revenge works.

622
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,514
With resolution to push your opponent down
to the deepest gutter,

623
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:08,517
you need to tear him apart.

624
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:11,520
My revenge is different from yours.

625
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:14,106
I don't aim to destroy people,

626
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:17,610
but make them pay for their crimes.

627
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,196
I became a lawyer to do that.

628
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:23,699
Watch how I slaughter Banseok and Gu Jingi

629
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:25,701
and enjoy.

630
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:28,329
It's my last gift for you.

631
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:49,600
I heard that you almost collapsed again.

632
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:51,686
That's not true.

633
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,814
I simply ran out of breath for a second.

634
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:58,359
I heard everything,
so don't think about covering it up.

635
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:01,279
Apply for a leave tomorrow
so that you can receive treatments.

636
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:04,156
I'll take responsibility
and see the investigation through.

637
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:06,826
No.

638
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:09,287
Not yet.

639
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,413
Hey, Geum Seokyeong.

640
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:12,957
I finally have Gu Jingi behind the bars.

641
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:14,583
I will investigate him myself

642
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:18,337
and identify the VIP
who received Seokju's heart.

643
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:21,048
No.

644
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:24,260
If you don't take a leave,
I will notify the chief prosecutor

645
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:25,594
so he will get you off the case.

646
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:26,929
Give me a week.

647
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:31,100
Just one week.
I will finish it in that time period.

648
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:35,396
Even if someone else attends the trials,

649
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:38,566
I want to finish the investigation
with my own hands.

650
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:41,152
Just one week.

651
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:45,114
As soon as it ends,
I will drag you to the hospital.

652
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:47,033
I promise.

653
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:50,661
And…

654
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:55,791
don't tell Han Yihan.

655
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:00,588
I will tell him myself
when everything gets wrapped up.

656
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:07,094
The leaders of Daehan Party

657
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:10,139
released an official statement
about discharging Candidate Yoon.

658
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:14,143
Okay. I will need to hasten the surgery.

659
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:17,521
Now, the period after the primaries
will be more important.

660
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:21,192
Yes, but do you still intend
to make Director Gu Hyunseong

661
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:23,736
the official operating surgeon?

662
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:34,789
Ms. Pyo?

663
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:35,998
<i>It's me, Gu Jingi.</i>

664
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:37,917
I apologize

665
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:40,628
for causing trouble.

666
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:43,047
What do you plan to do from now on?

667
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:45,007
<i>Don't worry.</i>

668
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:47,802
I won't make an unreasonable demand,

669
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:49,845
such as helping me walk free.

670
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:54,225
But if you are going to be
the president of Korea,

671
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,936
you should protect a Korean company

672
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:59,188
from a foreigner who hunts for companies.

673
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:02,817
I admitted all allegations today
to Prosecutor Geum Seokyeong.

674
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,986
So please protect Banseok

675
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:07,738
in my stead,

676
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:10,866
as the next president.

677
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:14,078
Okay.

678
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,789
I will think of a way.

679
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:18,290
Thank you.

680
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:31,637
Do you plan to help Banseok?

681
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,433
Father, you need to cut ties

682
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,726
with Banseok and Gu Jingi.

683
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:00,791
Han Yihan.

684
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:03,878
I wanted to spend

685
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:06,422
more time with him.

686
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:25,483
YOON MISEON

687
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:27,735
Jayden.

688
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:29,278
JAYDEN LEE

689
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:30,696
What are you hiding?

690
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:40,122
YOON MISEON, JADEN LEE, LIM TAEMOON
GU HYUNSEONG, GU JINGI, PYO EUNSIL

691
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,918
BANSEOK FOUNDATION'S GENERAL MEETING
OF STOCKHOLDERS

692
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,002
You can't enter.

693
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:47,588
What are you talking about?

694
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:50,424
Why can't I enter Banseok Foundation's
General Meeting of Stockholders?

695
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:53,677
I am sorry. Mr. Jayden Lee ordered us
to keep you from entering.

696
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:54,970
He did?

697
00:41:56,889 --> 00:42:00,226
Listen. It was just an altercation.

698
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:01,602
Even so. This isn't right!

699
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:07,900
I'm overseeing the Strategy Team for Asia.

700
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:08,984
Do you think it makes any sense

701
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:11,237
that I can't attend
an important meeting like this?

702
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:13,531
-Move.
-I'm sorry.

703
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:14,865
We're just following orders.

704
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:27,503
Thank you all for coming.

705
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:32,049
The stock price of Banseok R and D Center
plummeted three days in a row.

706
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:34,677
If the price hits the floor one more time,

707
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,845
it won't be possible
to return the investment,

708
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:39,682
even with all of your stocks combined.

709
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,519
To make up for the insufficient fund,

710
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:46,897
I would like to take Banseokwon
and Banseok University Medical Center.

711
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,901
What nonsense?
Who said you could take the hospital?

712
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:54,280
Are you all just going to
listen to his ridiculous demands?

713
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:56,574
Ms. Jang Jungok,
you should sit this one out.

714
00:42:56,657 --> 00:43:00,661
In a couple of days, you won't be
the largest stockholder of Banseok.

715
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:02,913
Honours Hand will be.

716
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:05,958
But according to the law in Korea,
a foreigner cannot own

717
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:07,835
a university medical center.

718
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:09,378
You don't have to worry about that.

719
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:11,922
Once Honours Hand takes over
Banseok University Medical Center,

720
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:16,176
we plan to get the permit renewed
as a for-profit hospital.

721
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,928
What nonsense is he talking about?

722
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:19,388
-Seriously?
-Director Lim.

723
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:21,432
-That's not right.
-Of course not.

724
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:24,101
Take a look here.

725
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:27,438
We will combine Banseokwon
and Banseok University Medical Center

726
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:28,814
into a for-profit hospital.

727
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:31,108
As Emergency Medicine suffers
from the largest deficit,

728
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:32,818
we'll minimize its operation.

729
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:34,987
As for OB-GYN, just like Banseokwon,

730
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:37,990
we'll provide tailored services
to a small number of expecting mothers.

731
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:39,491
Restructuring will be done there.

732
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:41,076
As for Cardiothoracic Surgery,

733
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:43,120
it will no longer be operated.

734
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:45,706
-He'll get rid of it?
-That's nonsense.

735
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:48,334
Cardiothoracic Surgery
is the symbol of Banseok.

736
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:49,627
How could you get rid of it?

737
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:51,962
It may have been a good symbol
in the past.

738
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:55,799
But now, it suffers from
the worst social stigma due to scandals.

739
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:57,760
That's not an essential department.

740
00:43:57,843 --> 00:44:00,929
I wonder if operating the department
is worth all the risks.

741
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:03,307
You, the Head of Cardiothoracic Surgery,

742
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:06,185
could lose your medical license
at any minute.

743
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:07,811
I don't think there's any other option.

744
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,864
Once Banseok University Medical Center
becomes a for-profit hospital,

745
00:44:18,947 --> 00:44:22,117
the board members here
will receive a part of the profits

746
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,245
as dividends.

747
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:31,085
You can decide.

748
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:33,462
Will you hold onto the stocks
that don't hold any value in the market?

749
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:36,757
Or will you receive
billions of won every year

750
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:40,135
as your dividends?

751
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:46,225
Is he serious?

752
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:55,442
Gu Jingi admitted to all the charges.

753
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:58,320
But he won't even talk
about the heart transplant

754
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:00,155
from five years ago.

755
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:02,324
I'm sure there's a reason for it.

756
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:05,369
A reason why
he must keep it a secret to the end.

757
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:07,746
How did it go with Jayden?

758
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:13,001
I asked him why he gave
Lee Dohyung the fountain pen.

759
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:15,921
But he kept mentioning revenge.

760
00:45:16,004 --> 00:45:17,047
Revenge?

761
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:19,591
He told me I was doing it the wrong way.

762
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:24,555
He told me to watch
how he would destroy Banseok

763
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:25,597
and Gu Jingi.

764
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,933
That doesn't add up.

765
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:30,269
Why would Jayden want revenge on Gu Jingi?

766
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:31,812
It makes sense if it were vice versa.

767
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:33,731
I don't get that either.

768
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:37,735
That's why I need to meet up with Michael.

769
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:39,069
Michael?

770
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:41,238
He knows about Jayden the best

771
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:43,907
at least in Korea.

772
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:45,325
JAYDEN LEE
HEAD OF HONOURS HAND'S ASIAN BRANCH

773
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,080
Michael.

774
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:51,915
But do you think he will cooperate?

775
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:53,959
He's Jayden's right-hand man.

776
00:45:55,377 --> 00:45:56,754
I should at least try.

777
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:03,761
JAYDEN LEE
HEAD OF HONOURS HAND'S ASIAN BRANCH

778
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:12,770
He made me do all sorts of menial tasks.

779
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:14,271
You're abandoning me like this?

780
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:19,485
I'll kill you.

781
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:20,778
I'll kill you!

782
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:22,988
One more bottle.

783
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:29,203
Are you sure? You already drank a lot.

784
00:46:34,416 --> 00:46:35,626
MR. HAN

785
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:36,919
Han Yihan?

786
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:40,339
Why is he calling me at this hour?

787
00:46:40,422 --> 00:46:42,966
Do you think I work for you?

788
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:51,934
<i>The person you reached is not available.
You'll be directed to voicemail.</i>

789
00:46:52,017 --> 00:46:53,560
<i>After the beep--</i>

790
00:46:54,436 --> 00:46:55,813
He's not answering?

791
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:57,064
No.

792
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:00,818
He must've found out
we're not working with Jayden anymore.

793
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:06,573
<i>The phone has been turned off.
You'll be directed to voicemail.</i>

794
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:12,830
It has been plummeting
for four days in a row.

795
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:16,875
I don't know
if I should be happy or sad about this.

796
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:18,168
Don't worry.

797
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:20,629
Once Honours Hand becomes
a new owner of Banseok,

798
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,131
the stock price will recover.

799
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:24,299
Anyway, congratulations.

800
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:27,302
With this, you have taken control
of Banseok for sure now.

801
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:29,054
We should congratulate your father.

802
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:30,806
He's registering as a candidate today.

803
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:33,100
Shouldn't you be there with him?

804
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:34,810
No.

805
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:37,187
Watching it from here will be enough.

806
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:39,106
<i>The candidate is coming in.</i>

807
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:42,943
LIM TAEMOON OF DAEHAN PARTY,
SPECIAL PRESS CONFERENCE

808
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:48,490
My fellow citizens.

809
00:47:49,074 --> 00:47:52,411
Before I register myself
as the presidential candidate today,

810
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:55,289
I'm standing here

811
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:58,709
to share the direction
our country ought to take

812
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:00,127
in the future.

813
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:04,089
But how come your father
still can't give up on Banseok?

814
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:06,675
Gu Jingi is done for,

815
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:09,469
and he no longer needs
Gu Hyunseong to operate on him.

816
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:12,055
Is there another reason…

817
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:14,725
I'm not aware of?

818
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:17,060
Another reason?

819
00:48:17,644 --> 00:48:19,104
<i>The low birth rate and aging society…</i>

820
00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:20,314
Yes, there is.

821
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:23,233
<i>…will certainly become
more serious problems.</i>

822
00:48:23,942 --> 00:48:24,776
<i>I…</i>

823
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:27,070
Even if Gu Jingi is completely ruined,

824
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:29,948
he can't betray Gu Jingi for this reason.

825
00:48:35,203 --> 00:48:37,873
LIM TAEMOON OF DAEHAN PARTY,
SPECIAL PRESS CONFERENCE

826
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:50,135
Candidate Lim, are you all right?

827
00:48:50,385 --> 00:48:51,345
Candidate?

828
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:53,597
<i>I'm the ambassador to the US, Lim Taemoon.</i>

829
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:54,973
<i>Who are you?</i>

830
00:48:56,516 --> 00:48:57,976
What are you doing?

831
00:48:58,185 --> 00:48:59,770
Stop taking photos of me!

832
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:02,773
Please calm down.
We're in the middle of a press conference.

833
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:04,399
A press conference?

834
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:07,152
Why am I holding a press conference?

835
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:10,113
<i>Stop taking photos of me.</i>

836
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:13,241
<i>-Stop taking photos.
-Move out of the way!</i>

837
00:49:14,576 --> 00:49:18,163
I think it's time
to tell you the truth now.

838
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:25,545
What if my father
should never be the president?

839
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:29,341
What will you do?

840
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:34,888
<i>-Stop taking photos of him.
-Move out of the way!</i>

841
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:38,350
<i>-Stop taking photos! Don't!
-Move! Move over!</i>

842
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:39,267
<i>Move!</i>

843
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:40,310
Don't tell me

844
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:42,145
he has Alzheimer's.

845
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:44,648
That's right.

846
00:49:44,898 --> 00:49:47,859
He's been taking the new drug
the R and D Center developed

847
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:50,195
for a very long time.

848
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:53,323
So his illness recurred
even after he had a heart transplant.

849
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:58,620
My father is actually the victim
of the new drug.

850
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:00,163
But the new drug

851
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:03,709
is significantly effective
in treating Alzheimer's.

852
00:50:04,459 --> 00:50:06,211
He's been taking it for a long time.

853
00:50:06,294 --> 00:50:07,629
Why is he suddenly showing symptoms?

854
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:14,136
Because I swapped it.

855
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:18,348
He's been taking health supplements,
not the new drug for over a month.

856
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:20,892
I thought
the symptoms would show up sooner,

857
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:23,311
but it took longer than I thought.

858
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:29,484
-Why would you do something like that?
-Like you said, only then

859
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:33,405
will I be able to stay as Lim Yuna,
not the daughter of a president

860
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:35,824
or Gu Hyunseong's wife.

861
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:39,077
I told you my secret.

862
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:43,373
So there's something
I need to check with you.

863
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:47,627
I need to see
if you are my true partner I can spend

864
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:49,588
the rest of my life with.

865
00:50:57,179 --> 00:51:01,725
Ambassador Lim
decided not to run for president.

866
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:06,104
He suddenly showed symptoms of
Alzheimer's during the press conference.

867
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:10,650
And Prosecutor Geum Seokyeong
requested your arrest warrant,

868
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:12,652
and the warrant was issued.

869
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:14,654
You'll be transferred
to a detention center tomorrow.

870
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:17,616
I must meet with Jayden.

871
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:20,202
-Jayden?
-Yes.

872
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:24,372
Once I get transferred, call Jayden.

873
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:26,374
And tell him to come see me.

874
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:28,043
Yes, sir.

875
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:39,012
The very first moment I met you,
I was reminded of someone.

876
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:40,347
Salome.

877
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:45,143
She danced before the King of Judea,
Herod, on his birthday.

878
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:47,938
And as a reward,
she asked the king to behead

879
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:50,065
the great prophet, John.

880
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:52,901
Salome.

881
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:55,278
Are you saying I'm evil?

882
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:57,823
It means you're loyal to your desires
more than anyone.

883
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:00,867
If chasing desires is evil,

884
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,912
I will gladly become a villain.

885
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:20,053
Are you stalking me?

886
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:23,515
Do you know how many times
you called me yesterday?

887
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:25,142
I'm sorry.

888
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:28,019
There was something
I had to ask you in person.

889
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:30,647
Ask me? Why?

890
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:32,732
You should talk to the almighty Jayden.

891
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:35,735
I thought you guys were best friends.

892
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:39,281
Jayden didn't talk to you?

893
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:44,578
Are you mocking me?

894
00:52:45,203 --> 00:52:47,372
Don't you know he fired me?

895
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:50,500
I didn't know.

896
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:53,587
And there's something
you didn't know as well.

897
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:56,673
That Jayden and I
aren't working together anymore.

898
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,344
What? You're not?

899
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:02,637
Take a seat.

900
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:05,891
I get the feeling
we might see eye to eye on things.

901
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:18,737
This footage was recorded by the camera
in the elevator to the penthouse.

902
00:53:20,071 --> 00:53:22,532
And the security guards saw

903
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:25,827
Director Lim Yuna enter through
the penthouse entrance this morning.

904
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:29,039
Bring me the master key.

905
00:53:29,122 --> 00:53:30,290
Pardon? But--

906
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:31,583
Are you deaf?

907
00:53:31,666 --> 00:53:33,293
Bring the master key now!

908
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:34,544
Yes, sir.

909
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:47,933
The fountain pen
Lee Dohyung was stabbed with.

910
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:52,187
No. Jayden gave him the fountain pen?

911
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:55,315
You really had no idea?

912
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:57,234
No.

913
00:53:57,609 --> 00:53:59,694
I didn't even know it had a camera.

914
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:02,072
He must have kept everything
under wraps even from you.

915
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:04,366
You were his right-hand man.

916
00:54:05,283 --> 00:54:06,660
Right-hand man, my foot.

917
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:09,579
He fired me over one mistake.

918
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:17,587
We want to know
why Jayden cornered Lee Dohyung to death

919
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:20,882
and why he is so hostile against Gu Jingi.

920
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:23,426
Do you know anything?

921
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:29,766
Actually,
Susie Yoon and I found that odd too.

922
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:32,894
Jayden seemed
to get unnecessarily worked up

923
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:35,772
when it had to do with Banseok Foundation.

924
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:37,983
Susie Yoon? Who's that?

925
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:39,943
She's an executive
at Honours Hand headquarters.

926
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:43,071
She was up for the position of the head
of the Asian branch against Jayden.

927
00:54:45,573 --> 00:54:46,992
It can be anything.

928
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:48,535
Anything that can tell me
about the relationship

929
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:50,745
between Jayden and Gu Jingi.

930
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:13,351
I'm not sure if this will count
as a reason to hate Gu Jingi.

931
00:55:13,893 --> 00:55:17,522
Five years ago, he came to Korea
to invest in Banseok Foundation.

932
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:21,067
And Jayden was in a car accident.

933
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:24,195
A car accident?

934
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:27,240
It happened late at night,
so I wasn't at the scene.

935
00:55:27,532 --> 00:55:30,869
He was transferred to Banseokwon
and had emergency surgery.

936
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:34,456
Afterward, he was in a coma
for two to three weeks.

937
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:37,250
<i>Who is that person?</i>

938
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:39,377
You don't need to know.

939
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:41,463
He came in three hours ago
from a car accident.

940
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:44,507
He won't last long.
He needs a transplant right now.

941
00:55:47,927 --> 00:55:50,889
There really was a car accident.

942
00:55:51,556 --> 00:55:54,100
What is it? Did you remember something?

943
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:09,866
If you're curious, you should find out.

944
00:56:13,286 --> 00:56:15,830
Yes. I finally get it.

945
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:31,304
Salome. I quite like it.

946
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:35,100
She sounds like a woman
who will get anything she wants.

947
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:45,360
-This is…
-Yes.

948
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:47,404
This is the freedom you gave me.

949
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:50,365
If I didn't take this that day,

950
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:52,951
I would still be the daughter
of the presidential candidate,

951
00:56:53,034 --> 00:56:53,952
not Lim Yuna.

952
00:56:55,286 --> 00:56:56,621
So I got this for us

953
00:56:57,539 --> 00:56:59,833
because today is the day
when we both got freedom.

954
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:44,961
What? You can't take it
because it's not yours?

955
00:57:48,006 --> 00:57:49,507
I kept wondering

956
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:55,930
if I passed out from the pill
because you made an honest mistake

957
00:57:57,015 --> 00:57:59,184
or because it was a part of your plan.

958
00:58:07,692 --> 00:58:08,902
You can't come in here.

959
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:11,446
I'm Prosecutor Geum Seokyeong
of the Medical Crime Department.

960
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:27,921
Who is it?

961
00:58:31,257 --> 00:58:32,800
Hyunseong. Why…

962
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:40,141
"Why?"

963
00:58:41,726 --> 00:58:44,771
I should be asking you. Why are you here?

964
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:47,232
Why?

965
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:51,736
I should have done this that night.

966
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:54,531
I was stupid to hesitate.

967
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:57,116
Look who's here.

968
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:02,080
Did you get your daddy's permission?

969
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:03,998
Right.

970
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:06,918
You couldn't have gotten his permission.

971
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:13,758
You scumbag.

972
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:21,140
You…

973
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:23,768
-Open up.
-But I was told to guard--

974
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:28,106
Die!

975
00:59:28,606 --> 00:59:29,899
Die, you punk!

976
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:34,904
Honey, it's dangerous.
You should go upstairs.

977
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:36,406
Okay. Be careful.

978
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:40,618
Yuna.

979
00:59:44,497 --> 00:59:47,542
I didn't know a papa's boy
like you could be this bold.

980
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:49,043
What a surprise.

981
00:59:49,127 --> 00:59:50,378
You lunatic.

982
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:52,880
I'll kill you!

983
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:54,132
Open the door now!

984
00:59:57,635 --> 00:59:58,678
Gu Hyunseong!

985
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:06,561
-Han Yihan.
-Come to your senses, and put that down.

986
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:09,606
Unless you want to join your father.

987
01:00:19,157 --> 01:00:20,658
You should have let him do it.

988
01:00:21,367 --> 01:00:23,911
It was your only chance
to get revenge on me.

989
01:00:25,204 --> 01:00:26,581
No.

990
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:29,208
That won't be enough.

991
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:03,201
You were the VIP patient at Banseokwon.

992
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:08,289
You have Seokju's heart,

993
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:12,669
don't you?

994
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:08,391
You have a wild imagination.

995
01:02:08,474 --> 01:02:10,977
But do you have evidence to back that up?

996
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:13,938
<i>It's a chance for us
to turn the table around in one go.</i>

997
01:02:14,021 --> 01:02:15,898
Chairman Gu, Mr. Cheon brought this.

998
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:18,317
I guess he still has
some tricks left up his sleeve.

999
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:20,486
What about Cheon Hyungu? Any progress?

1000
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:23,030
This rat is determined not to get caught.

1001
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:25,575
<i>We must find him before Gu Jingi's trial.</i>

1002
01:02:25,658 --> 01:02:27,493
<i>I'm sure he has evidence with him.</i>

1003
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:28,703
<i>I'm here to save you</i>

1004
01:02:29,036 --> 01:02:30,872
from Jayden and Honours Hand.

1005
01:02:30,955 --> 01:02:34,083
<i>Don't make me use
the last card I have left.</i>

1006
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:35,918
You are despicable to the end.

1007
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:40,173
Do you really think I don't know
what you did to me that night?

1008
01:02:46,679 --> 01:02:48,681
