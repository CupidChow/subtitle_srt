1
00:00:00,875 --> 00:00:04,879
THE NAMES OF PEOPLE, INCIDENTS, AND
BACKGROUNDS OF THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:06,131
That heart…

3
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:08,383
Who does it belong to?

4
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:13,096
The fellow passenger in the car died.

5
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,223
I took the heart out myself.

6
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:18,184
-That means…
-You're right.

7
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:19,894
It violates the Medical Service Act.

8
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:23,023
The passenger isn't
a registered organ donor,

9
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:25,900
and I didn't notify the guardian
of my action.

10
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:29,154
If this gets out,
my license will be revoked.

11
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:31,698
I might even be jailed.

12
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:34,576
Why are you doing this?

13
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:37,287
Because it's worth it.

14
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,582
No matter what the consequence is,

15
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:43,209
I will save this patient.

16
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,921
So please, do the surgery for me.

17
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:48,798
I'll assist you.

18
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:51,468
You're going to assist me?

19
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,136
You're already better than me.

20
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:56,848
You're the doctor
who's most likely to save him.

21
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:02,312
You have no time to think.

22
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:06,232
Will you let the patient expire
when you could've saved him?

23
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:09,235
You just need
to save the patient as a doctor.

24
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:15,533
This is the last surgery
I'll ask you to perform.

25
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:18,745
After this, you won't have to live
as Hyunseong's ghost.

26
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:21,873
And I'll spend the rest of my life

27
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:24,167
paying this debt back.

28
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:37,514
Then promise me.

29
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,058
That after the surgery,

30
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:44,813
you'll explain everything
to the patient and the donor's family.

31
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:46,147
I promise.

32
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:49,484
I'll take responsibility
for everything that'll happen

33
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:51,653
after this surgery.

34
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:58,660
You have my trust.

35
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,545
SURGERY IN PROGRESS

36
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:14,342
-That's…
-A Rachmaninoff concerto.

37
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:17,011
The patient listens to this very often.

38
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,430
If it hinders the surgery…

39
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:20,723
No, it's all right.

40
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,643
This can help the patient recover.

41
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:25,520
I'll begin.

42
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:10,815
Please cut.

43
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:13,902
Cut.

44
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:15,862
It has been two hours and 30 minutes.

45
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:33,546
Are you all right?

46
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,256
Yes.

47
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,728
SURGICAL TIMER

48
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:50,188
CURRENT TIME, ANESTHESIA TIMER

49
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,190
Removing the ACC.

50
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:00,865
Stop the pump. I'll insert the drain.

51
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:02,951
Giving the sign for stopping the pump.

52
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:07,163
One. Two. Three.

53
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,924
BP, 115 over 80. Heart rate, 110.

54
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:20,802
The patient is stable.

55
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:28,226
Wait.

56
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:33,356
The septum isn't beating very well.
What do we do?

57
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,994
-It's taking too long.
-Forty-five seconds elapsed.

58
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:47,078
Director Gu.

59
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:51,082
The surgeon must make the decision.

60
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:04,387
Epinephrine, two ampules.
Defibrillation, charge to ten joules.

61
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,514
-Charge to ten joules.
-Epinephrine, two ampules.

62
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:07,974
Ten joules.

63
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:14,772
-Twenty joules.
-Twenty joules.

64
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:15,857
Twenty joules.

65
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,576
Epinephrine, one ampule.

66
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,369
There must be air in the coronary.

67
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,046
Dr. Han, he was just sutured.

68
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,298
His heart might explode!

69
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,176
Director Gu.

70
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,597
The rhythm is back.

71
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:52,101
The heart rate is back.

72
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:54,979
It's going up.

73
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,678
-Great work, everyone.
-Great work.

74
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:28,763
Great work.

75
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:31,682
I'll watch him for a moment,
then finish up.

76
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:52,620
You did well.

77
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:57,667
Go get a good rest.

78
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:01,212
I'll talk to the hospital,
so don't worry about it.

79
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:05,550
-Thank you. Great work.
-Sure.

80
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,989
Director Gu put in a lot of thought.

81
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:51,429
I have to go check on Seokju.

82
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,898
EPISODE 2

83
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,246
-Have you seen Dr. Han Yihan?
-No.

84
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,581
Okay. Thank you.

85
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,728
-Hey, Daewoong.
<i>-Yihan, where are you?</i>

86
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:43,814
Why? What's going on?

87
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:46,526
<i>We're in trouble. It's Seokju. Seokju is…</i>

88
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,654
-The gel.
-The gel.

89
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:52,615
-A hundred joules.
-A hundred joules.

90
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:57,995
Check the rhythm.

91
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:00,331
Nothing.

92
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,584
-Again, 150 joules.
-To 150 joules.

93
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,425
-Continue to massage his heart.
-Yes.

94
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:16,514
Yihan, hurry.

95
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:19,850
What happened? Why is the ECMO here?

96
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:22,937
He wasn't doing well, so he was put on it.
But the ECMO flow isn't looking great.

97
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,063
How long has it been?

98
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:26,857
The ECMO line has shaken for a while.
Five minutes into his cardiac arrest.

99
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,402
He might go brain dead
even if his heart went back up.

100
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:30,861
-Keep massaging.
-Yes.

101
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,322
Give him epinephrine every two minutes.
Give me 200 joules.

102
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,240
-He just--
-Give me 200 joules!

103
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:35,992
Two hundred joules.

104
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:44,959
Move.

105
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:47,503
You should stop now.

106
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,380
-Seokju.
-Dr. Han, please stop.

107
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:51,507
Let go! Don't touch me.

108
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,466
Yihan.

109
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,760
Seokju. Seokju!

110
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:56,345
Yihan.

111
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:12,903
Seokyeong.

112
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:25,082
What's… What's going on…

113
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:31,172
You should declare his death.

114
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,215
His guardian is here too.

115
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,718
You performed his surgery,
so you should do it.

116
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,201
Mr. Geum Seokju.

117
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:06,999
November 21st, 2016,

118
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,087
at 2:23 P.M.,

119
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,884
he passed away.

120
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:24,850
No.

121
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,357
This can't be true.

122
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:36,070
No, right? No.

123
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,699
You said the surgery went well.

124
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,243
-Seokyeong.
-You promised.

125
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:47,373
You said Seokju could go to school
like everyone else

126
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,667
and make friends.

127
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:52,253
You said he could live

128
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:56,215
that ordinary and happy life!

129
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:59,844
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Seokyeong.

130
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,929
If you're sorry, bring him back.

131
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:07,017
Bring back my poor Seokju. Bring him back!

132
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:10,438
Bring him back alive! Bring him back!

133
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:13,190
Bring him back.

134
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:16,444
Bring him back…

135
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:19,822
Bring him back.

136
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:27,037
His condition suddenly worsened
from the morning.

137
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:29,915
I called you many times,
but you wouldn't pick up,

138
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,669
so Director Gu put the ECMO on him,

139
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:36,297
but his vitals never came back.

140
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:37,840
The director did it himself?

141
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:40,217
Yes, he was at Banseokwon.

142
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:43,137
He knew where I was.

143
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:46,557
What about at dawn?

144
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:48,768
How was he at dawn?

145
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:51,520
I didn't visit him.

146
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:55,816
Why not?
I asked you to check in on him every hour.

147
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,820
Well, Chief Cho Junghyun
changed the shifts.

148
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:02,698
Chief Cho? Why?

149
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:06,327
She said she has to manage
the VIP aseptic area for security.

150
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,913
You know the system.

151
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,831
The chief nurse always gets her way.

152
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,131
Donation?

153
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:24,762
You want to take
his heart tissues and eyes?

154
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:27,473
We must proceed quickly

155
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:30,351
when we make an attempt
to procure organs--

156
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:32,978
Even so, how can you ask me so quickly?

157
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:35,523
This is a consent form for organ donation.

158
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:40,110
I cannot even fathom

159
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:42,696
how painful this must be for you.

160
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,616
But even at this moment,
there are patients who are dying,

161
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:47,785
waiting for their transplant surgery,

162
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:50,955
just like Seokju did.

163
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,708
Please do not turn
the late patient's noble decision

164
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:57,962
into a wasted promise.

165
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,297
I ask of you.

166
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,719
-Give it to me.
-Thank you.

167
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:07,179
Seokyeong.

168
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:11,725
Transplant Coordinator, why are you here?

169
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:17,106
Wait, are you here to procure his organs?

170
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,732
-Yes.
-No.

171
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:20,568
He needs an autopsy first.

172
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,736
Why does he need that?

173
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,613
We need to know
the exact cause of his death.

174
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:26,156
Do not sign that.

175
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,992
Once they take the heart tissues,

176
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:30,202
it's tough to find the cause
through autopsy.

177
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:33,873
What do you mean?

178
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:38,002
Is there another reason why he died?

179
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:39,712
You should do the autopsy.

180
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:43,674
Nice to meet you.

181
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:46,260
My name is Gu Jingi, the director
of Banseok University Medical Center.

182
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,430
You should do the autopsy.

183
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:52,850
We have a pathologist
who has worked as a forensic pathologist

184
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:54,852
with the National Forensic Service.

185
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:57,187
We'll ask her to perform the autopsy

186
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,356
as we procure his organs.

187
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,692
Then we can disclose the cause of death

188
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:04,862
and save the lives of many other patients

189
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:06,530
who suffer just as he did.

190
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,247
Please do that.

191
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,749
Thank you.

192
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:19,627
We'll do our best
so that his death isn't left

193
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,545
with an inch of doubt.

194
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:29,470
The deceased passed away
at 2:23 P.M. on November 21st.

195
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,599
<i>He generously agreed to donate
his eyes and heart tissues.</i>

196
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:35,017
Thank you.

197
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,686
We must procure organs during the autopsy,
so let's move quickly.

198
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,188
Scalpel.

199
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,286
Are you all right?

200
00:15:57,122 --> 00:16:00,334
If this is too hard for you,
I can listen to the result alone.

201
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,920
In my career as a prosecutor,

202
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,632
I've given dozens and dozens
of orders for an autopsy.

203
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:09,927
I even came and watched a few of them.

204
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,471
But…

205
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,475
this is driving me crazy.

206
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:20,145
In there, Seokju is…

207
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,942
My brother's body is getting taken apart.

208
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,946
It's too tough to bear.

209
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:43,293
We finished the autopsy
and organ procurement of the deceased.

210
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:48,674
His eyes and skin tissues were
good enough to be transplanted.

211
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:50,884
However, his heart was

212
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:54,972
extremely damaged
to a point of dysfunction.

213
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,809
What happened to his heart?

214
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:01,186
It looks like
the hemorrhage of the pulmonary artery

215
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,856
caused cardiac tamponade.

216
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,692
His heart was pressed,

217
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:10,112
so his cardiac output decreased,
causing a shock.

218
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,948
Then he passed
because he wasn't handled quickly enough.

219
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:15,200
This is my opinion.

220
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:18,203
Are you saying Seokju died

221
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,664
because of the surgery?

222
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:23,083
Yes, the autopsy result says--

223
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:24,376
There's no way.

224
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:27,629
That's impossible.

225
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,257
I had to conduct an emergency phlebotomy,

226
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:33,302
but the measure was taken perfectly.
He was sutured well,

227
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:35,179
and his vitals were fine too.

228
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:38,599
I'm just telling you the truth
as revealed from the autopsy.

229
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:41,727
Also, I'm sure you already knew
how dangerous it is

230
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:44,688
to conduct an emergency phlebotomy
immediately after surgery

231
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:47,691
as a cardiothoracic surgeon.

232
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:49,318
But the situation was…

233
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:58,744
Seokyeong.

234
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:01,080
Seokyeong, no.

235
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:03,040
Something must have gone wrong.

236
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:09,630
MAY THE DECEASED REST IN PEACE

237
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:15,219
THE LATE GEUM SEOKJU

238
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:22,726
MAY THE DECEASED REST IN PEACE

239
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,813
Seokju.

240
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:30,109
<i>What will you do about Seokju?</i>

241
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:45,666
What's your plan now?

242
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:50,671
We should leave him at a children's home.

243
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:54,550
I'm sure you can manage yourself,

244
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:57,010
but you won't be able to look after him.

245
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,638
So leave him at a children's home for now,

246
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:01,765
then come find him when you're--

247
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:03,350
I won't let him go alone.

248
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:05,227
Don't be so stubborn.

249
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:08,105
You're too old to go to a children's home.

250
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,984
Seokju is only five years old now.

251
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,696
Do you feel better now that you say that?

252
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:19,116
-What?
-You don't want to take him.

253
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,411
But you want to do something
to save your face as an adult.

254
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:24,204
That's why you said that.

255
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,789
Hey, don't say that.

256
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:29,585
Seokyeong, that's not the way
to talk to your uncle.

257
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,128
I won't ask for your help.

258
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:34,298
So don't do anything at all.

259
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:37,092
I'll protect Seokju
no matter what happens.

260
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,928
Even if I break down,
I'll raise him on my own.

261
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:42,973
Fine. I get it.

262
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,021
Goodness.

263
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:56,904
MAY THE DECEASED REST IN PEACE

264
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:59,072
I said I'd protect you

265
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:01,742
at any cost.

266
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:16,048
Goodness, I feel so bad
for Prosecutor Geum.

267
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:41,240
Here.

268
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:47,204
Eat up.

269
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:50,415
Even if you don't feel like it,
shove it down.

270
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:52,417
That's the only way to hold out.

271
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:58,882
The guy you were going to marry
hasn't come yet?

272
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:03,303
Are you all right?

273
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:05,931
They said Seokju died…

274
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:10,936
because of him.

275
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:13,272
What?

276
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:15,857
The hospital conducted an autopsy.

277
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:22,614
They said Seokju died because
he performed a dangerous procedure.

278
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,995
But no matter how hard I think about it,
I don't believe that's true.

279
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:33,500
He looked after Seokju more than I did.

280
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,421
He assured me that the surgery went well…

281
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:41,216
and that he would keep monitoring him.

282
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:43,260
Why…

283
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:47,848
Why did my dear Seokju…

284
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,645
I'll reveal the truth.

285
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:57,691
I'll confirm
who is responsible for Seokju's death.

286
00:21:57,941 --> 00:21:59,276
So Seokyeong,

287
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,571
you should only focus on sending off
your brother properly for now.

288
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:08,493
Okay.

289
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:11,371
I will. Thank you.

290
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:26,345
Why can't I?

291
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:28,263
He was my patient for over five years

292
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,640
and I performed the transplant myself.
You know that, Ms. Kim!

293
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:33,685
Why can't I look at the surgical record?

294
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:38,023
The thing is… that I received an order.

295
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:39,399
Order?

296
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:41,985
I was told that since you'll be
investigated by the prosecutors,

297
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:47,199
I must limit your access
to the patient's medical records.

298
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:49,576
I'm sorry.

299
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:19,856
<i>That day, the patient was transferred
using the internal elevator</i>

300
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:21,983
<i>after the heart transplant.</i>

301
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:26,863
<i>The patient must still be here.</i>

302
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:39,418
Already?

303
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:42,295
Yihan!

304
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:43,839
Daewoong!

305
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:45,841
Yihan, what happened?

306
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,509
They circulated an internal announcement

307
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,636
that you'll be dismissed
from the Cardiothoracic Surgery Department

308
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:51,388
and a disciplinary committee will be held.

309
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:54,391
Daewoong, your access card.

310
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,726
Okay. Here you go.

311
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:01,398
Yihan, why are you doing this?

312
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:03,191
There is a patient I must find.

313
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:06,236
He got a heart transplant here
in the middle of the night two days ago,

314
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:08,905
so he should still be
in an aseptic area or in an ICU.

315
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:11,908
Heart transplant?
Someone else got one besides Seokju?

316
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:22,002
I guess everyone saw the announcement.

317
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:24,045
But still, how can they treat you
so differently overnight?

318
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:39,144
You stay here
and block people from coming in.

319
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:40,812
Block them? How?

320
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:43,732
By doing what you're good at.
I'll be counting on you.

321
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:46,276
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

322
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:48,570
What I am good at?

323
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:53,783
Using my strength?

324
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:57,120
Gosh, I'm the Crazy Bull of Magok-dong.

325
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:59,664
I get to use my strength.
It's been a while.

326
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:30,445
<i>-That's…
-A Rachmaninoff concerto.</i>

327
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:33,240
The patient listens to this very often.

328
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:37,702
Rachmaninoff.

329
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,439
<i>I need to find out</i>

330
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:09,276
who took Seokju's heart.

331
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:11,695
Dr. Han Yihan!

332
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,119
Dr. Han.

333
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:22,789
We have the director's order to stop you
from entering Banseokwon starting today.

334
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:25,959
Please put that down and come this way.

335
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:28,837
A prosecutor and detectives are
in the lobby.

336
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,089
Don't do anything you'll regret.

337
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:33,341
Nothing you do will matter anymore.

338
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:36,886
I already have plenty of regrets.

339
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:03,580
See? I told you.

340
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,168
There is nothing you can do.

341
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,213
Who is that patient
that you're going this far…

342
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:13,298
Get him out of here.

343
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:22,932
Who is that?

344
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,623
I'm Baek Kangho, a prosecutor
from Criminal Division One

345
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:47,624
of the Seoul Southern District
Prosecutors' Office.

346
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:49,000
Yes, I was notified.

347
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:54,297
It's the patient Geum Seokju's
surgical and medical records.

348
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:58,468
Mr. Han Yihan.

349
00:27:58,593 --> 00:27:59,886
You're under arrest

350
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:02,138
for special destruction
and damage and trespassing.

351
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:05,100
I need to check
your medical malpractice charge too.

352
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:09,229
You have the right to appoint a lawyer
and to remain silent.

353
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:11,940
Okay, let's go.

354
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:13,066
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

355
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:47,767
<i>Have the surgery at Banseokwon.</i>

356
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:50,186
He's the brother of someone
you deeply care about.

357
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:52,522
Of course, I can.

358
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:54,190
No need to feel bad. Just accept it.

359
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:57,694
This is nothing
compared to everything you've done

360
00:28:58,319 --> 00:28:59,988
for my son.

361
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:06,035
Do you agree?

362
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,081
What did you say?

363
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,332
<i>I asked if you agree</i>

364
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,918
<i>with the autopsy results
and surgical records.</i>

365
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:17,172
No, I don't agree with them.

366
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:18,923
I sutured it right after collecting blood.

367
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:20,759
BP and vital signs were normal,

368
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:22,886
and the staff also confirmed them with me.

369
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:29,100
Then, what were your whereabouts

370
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:31,227
while the victim suffered his death?

371
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:38,151
I was resting in the hospital.

372
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:40,695
You were resting
until your morning shift was almost over?

373
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:43,072
They called for you many times,
but you didn't respond.

374
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:46,409
You were his attending physician,

375
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:49,954
yet you never checked the condition
of the patient you operated on…

376
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:52,582
and didn't even show up
until his life was in danger?

377
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:54,959
Why did you go
to the medical record library?

378
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:58,046
Were you trying to tamper
with the surgical records?

379
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,216
You killed him.

380
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:05,011
If you had fulfilled your duties
as a doctor, Seokju wouldn't have died.

381
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:06,930
So plead guilty and ask for forgiveness.

382
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,390
That is

383
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:12,894
the only atonement you can make
for my junior colleague

384
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:15,480
who lost
the only remaining member of her family.

385
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:17,690
No.

386
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:20,401
I can't do that.

387
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:23,488
Because I didn't kill Seokju.

388
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:25,031
Is that so?

389
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:28,952
Then I'll make you admit…

390
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:32,455
that you're a murderer.

391
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,678
PRISONER TRANSPORT

392
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:49,556
Two lines. Over here.

393
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:01,985
We'll move now. Please follow me.

394
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:26,509
RESTRICTED AREA

395
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:37,270
ESTABLISH LAW AND ORDER

396
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:22,982
I used to rule my area.
You'd better stop that.

397
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:30,448
<i>Seokju!</i>

398
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:34,160
<i>Stop it!</i>

399
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:50,677
COUNSEL, DEFENDANT

400
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:01,938
Witness, proceed with the oath.

401
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:05,733
I solemnly swear

402
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:10,113
to tell the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth

403
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:16,077
under pains and penalties of perjury.

404
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:19,330
<i>Our key is the witness.</i>

405
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,916
If the surgery records
and autopsy report are rigged,

406
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,919
the testimony is the only way
to prove that.

407
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,629
Is there someone you can trust

408
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:28,506
among the medical staff members
you worked with?

409
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:34,053
Witness, you could observe the defendant
closest in surgery. Correct?

410
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:35,805
Yes, that's correct.

411
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:37,932
According to the surgery records
from the hospital,

412
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,267
during the surgery,

413
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:42,353
the defendant drew out the patient's blood
from his heart in an emergency.

414
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:45,273
And it doesn't say anything
about closing the affected area.

415
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:47,483
Now, let me ask you.

416
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:50,903
Witness, did you see
the defendant suture the incision?

417
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:59,412
I didn't see it.

418
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:05,960
Actually, I tried to stop him.

419
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:09,338
I said drawing out blood from a patient
who just had the transplant was risky.

420
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:11,841
But he ignored my opinion.

421
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:13,885
He proceeded on his own.

422
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:15,053
Kitae.

423
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:26,397
-What are you doing?
-That's the truth.

424
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,483
I definitely told you it was risky.

425
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:30,359
-But you did it anyway.
-Park Kitae!

426
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:32,737
Witness, quiet down.

427
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,530
Defendant, you too. Sit down.

428
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:37,575
If you cause another disturbance,
you'll be removed from the court.

429
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:40,411
Seriously. This wasn't your first time.

430
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:41,704
I always told you it was risky

431
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:43,831
and we shouldn't have done it,
but you did it anyway.

432
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:45,875
You have no idea how awful that is.

433
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:49,003
I knew that your stubbornness

434
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:51,047
would cost a life one day.

435
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:58,262
WITNESS

436
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:03,976
I solemnly swear

437
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,728
to tell the truth,

438
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:07,146
-the whole truth…
-…the whole truth,

439
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,189
and nothing but the truth

440
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:10,108
-under the pains…
-…under the pains…

441
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:12,151
…and penalties of perjury.

442
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:14,237
Witness Cho Junghyun.

443
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:18,741
I was in charge of filling out the surgery
and medical records of the patient.

444
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:20,660
I recorded everything truthfully.

445
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:23,871
Everything you see on the records is true.

446
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:30,211
Instructions from the lead surgeon
during heart transplants are imperative.

447
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:33,089
As an anesthesiologist,
I followed the lead surgeon's instructions

448
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:34,799
and injected the drugs.

449
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:37,593
He came to my office

450
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:41,305
and demanded to have access
to the patient's medical records.

451
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:43,724
I explained to him I couldn't
because of the investigation.

452
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:46,060
But he kept demanding to see them.

453
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:49,564
I performed the tissue procurement
with the autopsy,

454
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,816
but I can assure you
I was focused on the autopsy too.

455
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,902
As a forensic pathologist,
I performed many autopsies so far

456
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:57,697
and am certain
that the autopsy report is accurate.

457
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,370
This is our last witness.

458
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:09,292
You were the scrub nurse of the surgery.

459
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:11,252
So you were there
to observe the defendant's surgery

460
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:13,296
from the beginning to the end. Correct?

461
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:17,383
Yes. I saw the surgery with my two eyes
and remember it clearly.

462
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:19,886
You can speak softly.

463
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:22,889
I see. Okay.

464
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,017
Did you see Mr. Han Yihan

465
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,686
suture the incision
after he drew out the patient's blood

466
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:30,188
as an emergency treatment?

467
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:32,398
Of course. Yihan…

468
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:37,904
I mean, I put the suture tool
on Dr. Han's hands myself.

469
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:41,699
Was there any bleeding after he closed up?

470
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:44,160
No. There was no bleeding at all!

471
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:45,661
That is all.

472
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:47,663
Prosecution, your witness.

473
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:53,502
-Okay. Mr. Kang Daewoong.
-Yes.

474
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:56,380
What did you call the defendant?

475
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:58,925
I said, Dr. Han.

476
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:03,888
No. Before that,
didn't you call him by his first name?

477
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:05,681
Oh, that. I…

478
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:07,099
I know

479
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:10,061
you two went to the same high school

480
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:12,730
and have a very close friendship.

481
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,192
When the defendant illegally broke
into Banseokwon,

482
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:18,611
you assaulted the security guards
who tried to stop him

483
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:20,488
and caused a scene
to buy the defendant time.

484
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:23,449
Your Honor. This is irrelevant.

485
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:25,284
How is this irrelevant?

486
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:27,662
The witness is
the defendant's close friend.

487
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:30,164
How can we be sure
the witness will not perjure himself?

488
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:33,751
All right. How about this?

489
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:37,004
Did you know
the defendant was an ex-convict

490
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:40,591
who served more than a year in prison
for aggravated assault?

491
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:43,302
-Your Honor!
-Why are you bringing that up now?

492
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:44,762
Quiet!

493
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:48,224
Prosecutor, you must respect the witness.

494
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:50,810
Yes, Your Honor.

495
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:53,938
However, when the medical staff members

496
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,691
are giving us contradictory testimonies
just like now,

497
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,402
whose testimony will be more trustworthy?

498
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:03,155
A licensed cardiothoracic surgeon?

499
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:07,743
Or a man who's been friends
with the defendant for over ten years…

500
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:13,291
Fine. A scrub nurse with a prior.

501
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:17,420
-What is this?
-He was an ex-convict?

502
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:21,465
-I can't believe he was an ex-convict.
-Unbelievable.

503
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:23,968
-Right.
-I can't believe this.

504
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:30,599
-Goodness.
-This is awful.

505
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:33,102
-How could he do this?
-Seriously.

506
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:35,271
-He killed a boy.
-He's a murderer.

507
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:54,999
-What are you doing?
-Step aside.

508
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:57,918
Wait. My son didn't do anything wrong!

509
00:38:58,377 --> 00:39:01,213
How dare you barge into my home
and go through my things?

510
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:03,007
We received a report your son took bribes

511
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,468
from a medical equipment agency,
so we're investigating.

512
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:06,927
Please cooperate.

513
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:09,472
There's no way my son did that!

514
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:10,848
Get out of my house now!

515
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:12,183
I found it.

516
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:16,937
It was under his bed.

517
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:20,983
Where did he get this money?

518
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,986
What's all that?

519
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:27,323
I have no idea. Why is that in my house?

520
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:29,158
Since you don't know,
we'll find out for you

521
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:30,785
and see what kind of crime he committed.

522
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:33,204
Get the computer hard drive
and his belongings.

523
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:34,538
Yes, sir.

524
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:58,229
Hey, come on. Massage it harder.

525
00:39:58,312 --> 00:40:00,564
-You have to do it harder.
-Let me see.

526
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,358
Once I get released…

527
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:04,527
Hey, Doc!

528
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,080
I heard about you.

529
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:19,041
You used to be some hotshot doctor.

530
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:23,254
Gosh. I can't believe
I'm conversing with a smart guy like you.

531
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:27,842
-What do you want?
-Gosh. You're one grumpy doctor.

532
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:32,263
Listen.

533
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:36,016
You see him over there?
My friend hurt his arm.

534
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,269
I want you to take a look at him.

535
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:42,481
Talk to the guard.
They will move him to the infirmary.

536
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:44,859
Goodness. You're dense.

537
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:48,446
Why would I ask you to take a look
if I can just tell the guard about it?

538
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:50,865
I'm asking you for a reason.

539
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,744
You don't want to?

540
00:40:57,121 --> 00:41:00,666
I don't know how long you'll be here, Doc.

541
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:03,669
But if you get on my bad side,

542
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:06,672
your hands might pay for it.

543
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:24,607
Hey. Take him.

544
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:27,610
Let's go.

545
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:39,079
Where's the patient?

546
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:45,920
You must've had your nose in a book
all your life.

547
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:47,338
You are too gullible.

548
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:52,927
Gosh. Look at that strong doctor.

549
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,929
Come on. Get him to loosen up.

550
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:56,222
Yes, boss.

551
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:04,939
Doc.

552
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:07,608
Don't resent me.

553
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:09,151
I'm doing it to survive too.

554
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:11,070
Do it.

555
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:51,610
Who…

556
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,790
Director Gu. How did you get in here?

557
00:43:04,873 --> 00:43:06,333
I asked them for a favor.

558
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:09,712
I wanted to talk to you in private.

559
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:11,880
Talk?

560
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:14,008
Isn't it too late for a talk?

561
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:17,094
Did you buy off
the head of the infirmary too?

562
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:19,471
Just like all the witnesses in my trial?

563
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:21,932
Admit that it was medical malpractice.

564
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:25,311
If you admit
the medical malpractice charge

565
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:27,146
and show remorse,

566
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:29,773
you will lose your medical license,

567
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:32,276
but…

568
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:34,361
you won't serve time.

569
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:35,821
It was Seokju's, wasn't it?

570
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:40,659
The heart the VIP got that night
was from Seokju, wasn't it?

571
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:43,662
That's why you wanted me

572
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:45,623
to do the surgery at Banseokwon.

573
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:47,374
I don't follow you.

574
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:50,461
Enough with your nonsense.

575
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:53,088
Whatever you say,
people won't believe you.

576
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:54,882
And it won't change the result.

577
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:57,718
Are you afraid?

578
00:43:58,677 --> 00:44:01,805
That I might reveal the truth?
Are you scared?

579
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:04,475
Yes. You'll be scared.

580
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:09,813
I'll tell the world that I was your son's
ghost doctor who operated on VIP patients

581
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:11,690
and did the transplant
for a patient I didn't know

582
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:13,817
with a heart
I didn't know where it came from!

583
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:17,488
I'm going to reveal everything in court!

584
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:20,449
Go ahead

585
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:23,285
if you want to get killed without a trace.

586
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:27,247
Getting rid of you here isn't even hard.

587
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:30,918
But do you think
your mother will survive that?

588
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:33,003
What did you say?

589
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:35,964
Your mother is still on her meds, right?

590
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:40,719
The prosecutor seized your belongings
and found a bundle of cash in your room.

591
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:42,971
And your mother passed out.

592
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:46,850
She's fragile when it's been over a decade
since your father's death.

593
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:49,269
How will she feel
once she loses her only son?

594
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:51,772
Can she cope with that?

595
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:53,232
Shut your mouth!

596
00:44:53,315 --> 00:44:56,110
Leave my mother out of this!
If you don't, I'll kill you!

597
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:01,031
Do you get it now?

598
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:03,992
I'm not the one who should be scared.

599
00:45:04,284 --> 00:45:05,327
It's you.

600
00:45:06,328 --> 00:45:08,163
So give up and do what I say.

601
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:10,457
Then you'll live.

602
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:14,628
Both you and your mother.

603
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:19,883
Stop!

604
00:45:20,634 --> 00:45:23,053
You're the one
who took out Seokju's heart!

605
00:45:24,346 --> 00:45:27,349
You killed Seokju!

606
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:29,184
Gu Jingi!

607
00:45:51,373 --> 00:45:52,916
Will this be enough?

608
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:57,129
If you want, we can make it certain
that he never talks.

609
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:59,882
Although he must hate me,

610
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:02,885
I owe him.

611
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:34,708
Thank you, Yihan.

612
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:38,128
<i>I'm sure Dr. Han will do his best.</i>

613
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:40,881
<i>So don't worry about anything and wait.</i>

614
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:43,091
I'll come back with a strong new heart.

615
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:47,888
<i>The heart the VIP got that night
was from Seokju, wasn't it?</i>

616
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:49,932
<i>That's why you wanted me</i>

617
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:52,309
<i>to do the surgery at Banseokwon.</i>

618
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:54,770
<i>Whatever you say,
people won't believe you.</i>

619
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:57,147
<i>And it won't change the result.</i>

620
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:43,694
ESTABLISH LAW AND ORDER
TO RESPECT HUMAN DIGNITY

621
00:47:54,788 --> 00:47:55,914
No visitation allowed?

622
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:57,749
Right.

623
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:01,628
He had a huge fight with another inmate.
So he's in a solitary cell.

624
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:04,047
He had a fight? Why?

625
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:06,675
We don't know because
neither of the parties is willing to talk.

626
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:10,554
Anyway, I can't let you see him
according to the protocol.

627
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:12,556
You're not handling his case either.

628
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:25,736
Gu Jingi.

629
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:26,862
<i>Do you get it now?</i>

630
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:28,530
Gu Jingi.

631
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:31,909
I'm not the one who should be scared.
It's you.

632
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:35,412
<i>So give up and do what I say.</i>

633
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:37,331
Then you'll live.

634
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:40,584
Both you and your mother.

635
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:45,797
Stop! Gu Jingi!

636
00:48:59,227 --> 00:49:01,772
CASE NUMBER 2016-2735
OF SINGLE JUDGE DIVISION

637
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:04,524
HAN YIHAN'S SECOND TRIAL

638
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:10,030
I plead guilty to the charge.

639
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:14,660
The patient died

640
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:17,245
because of medical malpractice on my side.

641
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:21,041
The patient died…

642
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:24,503
because of me.

643
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:27,798
I'm sorry.

644
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:30,384
I'm sorry.

645
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:33,011
Your Honor.

646
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:36,598
As you can see,
the defendant admitted his mistake

647
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:37,975
and is repenting it.

648
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:42,104
And the defendant performed the surgery
to treat the patient, not to harm him.

649
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:44,648
As he clearly showed no intention to harm,

650
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:47,859
I ask that you take this
into consideration for your ruling.

651
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:57,119
I will announce the sentence.

652
00:49:57,202 --> 00:50:00,831
The defendant admitted his mistake,
albeit late.

653
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:03,417
As he performed the surgery
to treat the patient,

654
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:06,169
it is difficult to find the defendant

655
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:08,755
with a hostile intent to harm the patient.

656
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:11,842
Thus, his action cannot be seen
as an intentional injury.

657
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:15,137
However, the defendant proceeded
with the procedure

658
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:17,973
that could harm the patient
against the advice

659
00:50:18,056 --> 00:50:20,684
of his fellow medical staff
and caused the patient to die.

660
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:23,103
Therefore, his action must be punished.

661
00:50:23,311 --> 00:50:28,233
Given the money seized at his house
and his confession,

662
00:50:28,316 --> 00:50:31,737
it is acknowledged that the defendant
illegally received 300 million won.

663
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:33,697
Thus, the court acknowledges

664
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:35,824
the indictment brought up
by the prosecutor

665
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:40,662
and sentences the defendant
to two years in prison

666
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:42,998
with a two-year stay of execution.

667
00:51:23,872 --> 00:51:25,165
Stop!

668
00:51:29,836 --> 00:51:30,796
Why…

669
00:51:31,713 --> 00:51:33,298
Why did you plead guilty?

670
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:36,301
You didn't do it.

671
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:41,431
Seokju didn't die because of you.

672
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:45,685
You told me to believe you.
Why did you suddenly…

673
00:51:48,688 --> 00:51:49,981
Tell me.

674
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:52,859
Tell me you didn't kill Seokju

675
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:56,446
and it wasn't your fault.

676
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,866
Tell me. Come on, do it!

677
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:02,077
No.

678
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:05,664
I killed him.

679
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,339
So let's put an end to our relationship.

680
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:19,386
If we stay together,
we will only hurt each other.

681
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:24,599
I am sorry
that I couldn't keep my promise.

682
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:31,022
Why…

683
00:52:33,024 --> 00:52:34,776
Why did this happen?

684
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:39,698
Why did all the people I love…

685
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:44,661
end up like this?

686
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:37,797
The defendant won't appeal.

687
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:39,716
He will accept the judgment of the court.

688
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:43,261
We could appeal,
but the result won't be different.

689
00:53:44,262 --> 00:53:46,056
Is this the end then?

690
00:53:48,141 --> 00:53:49,768
A person died.

691
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:55,106
Someone died. How can you call it
a mistake and leave it at that?

692
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:58,401
No.

693
00:53:59,861 --> 00:54:02,697
I can't let it end like this.
I will change it.

694
00:54:04,032 --> 00:54:06,743
If doctors don't get punished for murder,

695
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:10,622
I will make them pay.

696
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,884
All vital signs are stable.

697
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:26,179
You will be able
to leave the hospital tomorrow.

698
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:30,392
Congratulations on acquiring
a young and healthy heart.

699
00:54:32,018 --> 00:54:33,186
Now,

700
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:36,523
it's time for you to uphold your promise.

701
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:42,404
<i>Today on Monday, February 7th,</i>

702
00:54:42,487 --> 00:54:44,656
<i>the sky will be clear and blue
for the first time in a while.</i>

703
00:54:44,739 --> 00:54:45,615
FIVE YEARS LATER, PRESENT

704
00:54:45,907 --> 00:54:48,285
<i>When the beautiful weather
lifts up the mood,</i>

705
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:51,871
<i>why don't you contact those
you haven't heard from in years</i>

706
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:56,751
<i>to ask them how they have been
and tell them that you love them?</i>

707
00:55:36,249 --> 00:55:38,126
SEOKJU, REST IN PEACE AT A GOOD PLACE
I LOVE YOU

708
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:53,600
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, SEOKJU

709
00:55:57,687 --> 00:55:58,813
<i>Seokju,</i>

710
00:56:00,231 --> 00:56:04,027
<i>happy 24th birthday.</i>

711
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:15,372
Today, there will be a trial for
a fatal medical malpractice at Banseok.

712
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:19,334
This time, I will make sure
there is proper punishment…

713
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:22,879
for a murderer…

714
00:56:24,923 --> 00:56:26,216
in the guise of a doctor.

715
00:56:27,008 --> 00:56:30,428
SEOKJU, REST IN PEACE AT A GOOD PLACE
I LOVE YOU

716
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:32,347
-Doctors aren't gods!
-Doctors aren't gods!

717
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:34,265
Revoke their license to kill!

718
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:35,975
-Revoke it!
-Revoke it!

719
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:38,311
Banseok University Medical Center,
an evil group!

720
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:40,355
-An evil group!
-An evil group!

721
00:56:40,438 --> 00:56:42,565
Apologize to the public!

722
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:44,484
Repressed doctors. Failed medical system!

723
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:45,902
-Repressed doctors!
-Failed medical system!

724
00:56:45,985 --> 00:56:47,570
Our nation will collapse!

725
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:49,197
-It will collapse!
-It will collapse!

726
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,990
We refuse patients!

727
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:53,827
Gosh, there are so many protesters.

728
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:56,454
-Stop it!
-Stop it!

729
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:58,039
Repressed doctors. Failed medical system!

730
00:56:58,123 --> 00:56:59,541
-Repressed doctors!
-Failed medical system!

731
00:56:59,624 --> 00:57:01,918
You must be happy that this became a hit.

732
00:57:02,001 --> 00:57:03,002
A hit?

733
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:06,047
It's rare for the department
that specializes in medical malpractices

734
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:09,175
to receive the spotlight
on a national scale.

735
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:13,304
This is like a blockbuster.

736
00:57:13,388 --> 00:57:15,473
The prosecution hasn't done much.

737
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:16,766
It's all
on Banseok University Medical Center.

738
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:19,352
People were already talking
about the place,

739
00:57:19,644 --> 00:57:22,230
so the unfortunate accident
added fuel to the fire.

740
00:57:23,898 --> 00:57:26,901
Even if it's a blockbuster,

741
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:29,696
you should know
that it will be meaningless

742
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:32,365
if it gets pulled from the theaters
right away.

743
00:57:33,324 --> 00:57:34,284
See you in there.

744
00:57:34,367 --> 00:57:36,578
-We refuse patients!
-We refuse patients!

745
00:57:36,661 --> 00:57:38,413
Repressed doctors. Failed medical system!

746
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:39,956
-Repressed doctors!
-Failed medical system!

747
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:41,708
Our nation will collapse!

748
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:43,668
-It will collapse!
-It will collapse!

749
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:45,503
CASE NUMBER 2022-4210
OF THREE-JUDGE-PANEL DIVISION

750
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:48,173
We admit to all charges
made by the prosecution.

751
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:50,967
But medical treatments were administered
to heal the patient

752
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:52,927
and the doctor had no intention to harm.

753
00:57:53,011 --> 00:57:55,221
Please consider those facts
when you make the verdict.

754
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:00,393
Your Honor,

755
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:04,481
the defendant denied the charges
throughout the investigation.

756
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:08,193
He posted the victim's medical information
on social media to plead innocence

757
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:10,653
without the slightest show of remorse.

758
00:58:11,362 --> 00:58:14,866
The way he admits to the charges
and begs for a light sentence belatedly

759
00:58:14,949 --> 00:58:19,370
is an insult to the court
and everyone here.

760
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:22,207
Defendant, do you admit to the charges?

761
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:24,417
Yes.

762
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:29,839
As you can see, he is repentant
because he acknowledges his mistakes.

763
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:33,676
Also, Banseok Foundation promises
an appropriate compensation

764
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:36,930
as an ethical responsibility
for leaking the victim's information.

765
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:39,224
Understood.

766
00:58:39,307 --> 00:58:41,059
Defendant. Please rise.

767
00:58:42,810 --> 00:58:45,104
Defendant. Please rise.

768
00:58:46,731 --> 00:58:48,274
DEFENDANT

769
00:58:51,986 --> 00:58:52,946
I will announce the sentence.

770
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:55,031
It is recognized

771
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:58,993
that the defendant Park Kitae
neglected his duty of care

772
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:00,745
to his patient as a doctor.

773
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:05,667
Accordingly, the court acknowledges

774
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:07,252
that the defendant Park Kitae
caused the death of the young victim

775
00:59:07,835 --> 00:59:10,880
due to professional negligence…

776
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:19,889
Thus, the court sentences him
to two years…

777
00:59:22,475 --> 00:59:23,935
Defendant. Are you all right?

778
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:30,775
Defendant.

779
00:59:36,781 --> 00:59:38,491
Defendant! Defendant!

780
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:39,784
Please check on him.

781
00:59:41,786 --> 00:59:43,454
Mr. Park Kitae. Can you hear me?

782
00:59:43,538 --> 00:59:45,248
Defendant! Mr. Park Kitae!

783
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:52,297
-There is no heartbeat.
-What in the world…

784
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:54,257
AED! Please bring a defibrillator now.

785
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:55,258
Yes, Your Honor.

786
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:24,120
What's going on? Why isn't it working?

787
01:00:24,203 --> 01:00:25,413
Dang.

788
01:00:26,914 --> 01:00:28,916
-What about the ambulance?
-I called for it already.

789
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:36,341
-Is he dead?
-There is no hope.

790
01:00:36,424 --> 01:00:39,093
Too much time has passed.

791
01:00:52,732 --> 01:00:53,941
Han Yihan.

792
01:00:57,695 --> 01:00:59,280
What on earth are you doing here?

793
01:01:45,868 --> 01:01:47,912
WE THANK NAM KEEAE AND LEE YUNHUI
FOR SPECIAL APPEARANCES

794
01:01:52,834 --> 01:01:55,253
<i>To be honest, I am surprised.
I didn't expect such a change.</i>

795
01:01:55,336 --> 01:01:57,922
<i>Why are you surprised?
Did you think I would be gone forever?</i>

796
01:01:58,005 --> 01:01:59,882
You made a promise that night.

797
01:01:59,966 --> 01:02:01,467
<i>You will uphold that promise.</i>

798
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:03,052
<i>A lawyer? How could you defend</i>

799
01:02:03,136 --> 01:02:05,930
a doctor
from Banseok University Medical Center?

800
01:02:06,013 --> 01:02:07,056
<i>Let's keep this professional.</i>

801
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:10,268
<i>We are only a prosecutor and a lawyer
who met for a trial.</i>

802
01:02:10,351 --> 01:02:14,105
<i>Banseok University Medical Center
received approval to proceed Phase Two.</i>

803
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:16,566
<i>Honours Hand? A lobbyist?</i>

804
01:02:16,649 --> 01:02:19,777
<i>It's where people
with a demon's tongue and fingers gather.</i>

805
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:21,446
I am the black-haired foreigner
who works there.

806
01:02:21,529 --> 01:02:24,657
I am the head of the Asian branch,
Jayden Lee.

807
