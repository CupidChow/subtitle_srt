We will assess the situation

195
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,740
once the patient wakes up.

196
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:33,660
Thanks.

197
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,060
Master.

198
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,300
Your grandpa asked me
to bring you and Miss. Ji back.

199
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,100
Uncle Guang.

200
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,700
This is my own business,

201
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,100
which has nothing to do with Miss. Ji.

202
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:52,820
Master.

203
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,580
Don't make it hard for me.

204
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:56,580
Take them away.

205
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,220
Uncle Guang.

206
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,860
I don't want to repeat it.
