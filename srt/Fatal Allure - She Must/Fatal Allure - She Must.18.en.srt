Is it because of Ms. Ji?

37

She said yes to Ji Linjiang's proposal.

38

I've been wanting to tell you

00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:32,700
Tell me.

48
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,140
My confession to you back then

49
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,380
was to Jingshu.

50
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,420
Jingya,

51
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,460
it was a misunderstanding.

52
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,100
The person I like is not you.

53
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:47,700
It was actually Jing...

Wait a minute.

55
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,660
I'm going to pick up Jingshu
with my grandmother later.

56

Let's talk about this when I come back.

57
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,260
So that's what you're going to tell me

58
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,420
when Jingshu returns home.

59
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,010
That's right.

60
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,060
Jingshu took your place in school,

61
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,420
and I met her before I met you,

62
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,140
so my confession to you

63
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,900
was to Jingshu.

64
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,060
Did you ever like me?

65
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,460
Sorry, no.

66
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,340

67
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,060
it's all my fault.

68
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,700
It may have been unfair to you,

69
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,000
but you are back now,

70
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,900
so I don't want this mistake
to continue.

71
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,980
Sipu, it's indeed all your fault.

72
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,540
You have to bear the consequences
of this matter.

73
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,700
Even if you don't like me,

74
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,420
my sister is dead now.

75

77

right?

78
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,300
What are you trying to say?

79
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,860

I can try my best to make it up
to you in other things,

82

but when it comes to marriage,

83
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,060
I can't.

84
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,260

85
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,740

86

She is who she is.

87

88

that Ji Chan is Jingshu

90
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,900
because she must have her reasons

91
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,380
