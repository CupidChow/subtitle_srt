Master.

15
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,740
Someone left a note at the door,

16
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:53,860
saying it's for you.

17
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,540
[You didn't perform well last night.
Don't forget to pay me back for the room.]

18
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:05,580
You didn't perform well last night.

19

22
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,260
Last night...

23
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:15,980
How's the investigation?

24
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:18,700
The information shows

25
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,220
that Ji Chan

26
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,180
has a clear

27
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:22,740
resumé.

28
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:24,420
However...

29
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,820
So, she indeed works for him.

30
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:34,900
I'm wondering

31
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,260
what kind of tricks she will play

32
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,820
on the tender meeting later.

Master Ji.

My cousin,

36
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:01,820
we are family.

37
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,060
But why can we only meet

38
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:04,980
at a tender meeting?

39
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:08,860
Family?

40
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,300
I'm a Song,

41
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,220

Tell him

45
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,060
to take care

46
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,140
and not to worry about other things.

47
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:23,580
Fine.

48
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:24,580
I will tell him.

49
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,100
But you know,

50
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,500
I don't think it's wise

51
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,820
to compete with me
for the property of Wang Tang.

52
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,340
I'm afraid
that you will be humiliated later.

53
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:34,860
So,

54
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,500
it seems that you've got the property

55
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,060
by buying Master Qi over.

56
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,200
Master Qi acquired
the property of the Mins

57
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,880
and is now putting it up for bidding.

58
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,940
It's just a way for you
to officially take it over.

59
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,900
Three years ago,
the Min family was shattered.

If it turns out
you're connected to this,

61
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,740
I will definitely make you pay for it.

62
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:03,780
Me? How ridiculous!

63
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,260
Everyone knows

64
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,660
that it was you, Song Sipu,

65
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,500
who made the Min family shattered.

66
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:16,980
Master Qi.

67
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:40,980
Master Qi.

68
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,460
She might reach out to Master Qi

69
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,460
through Ji Linjiang.

70
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,260
Go find it out.

71
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,220
Yes.

72
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,140
Master Qi.

73
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,100
Master.

74
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,020
We found out

75
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,740
that Ji Chan said she was

76
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,020
a good friend of Min Jingshu,

77
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,540
which is why Master Qi
gave her a chance.

78
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:34,900
Besides,

79
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,260
If she gets involved
in the name of the Mins,

80
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,180
I'm afraid

81
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,740
it will be difficult for us
to acquire Wang Tang.

82
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,380
Ji Chan,

83
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,340
take notes later.

84
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,100
You'll be responsible for following up

85
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,300
on the matters
regarding the Wang Tang property.

86
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,500
No problem.

87
00:04:58,860 --> 00:04:59,860
Master Qi.

88
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:07,820
What?

89
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,540
Many people are waiting outside.

90
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,620
Are you that impatient?

91
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,380
Ji Chan.

92
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,420
I've warned you

93
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,700
and offered you one chance.

94
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:18,980
This time,

95
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,260
you really shouldn't

96
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,420
get involved in the name of the Mins.

97
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,140
What?

98
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:25,900
Are you worried

99
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,420
that I might accidentally spill

100
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:28,970
what you did

101
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,940
to the Min family

102
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,380
back then?

103
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,060
Do you think you know the Mins well?

104
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:40,580
Calm down.

105
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,300
This is the bidding information

106
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,820
that Master Qi disclosed to Ji Linjiang.

107
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:49,860
What do you suggest?

108
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:52,940
I want you to win.

109
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,820
Moreover,

110
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,660
I will help you to win.

111
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:00,580
It shows

112
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,900
my sincerity.

113
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,700
Now you can believe me?

114
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:14,460
Master.

115
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,460
Someone forwarded
the bidding information

116
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,300
to everyone before the meeting.

117
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,060
It's also signed
with Ji Linjiang's name.

118
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,660
All the people here received that.

119
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:22,820
Master Qi was mad

120
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:23,940
at Ji Linjiang.

121
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,300
Ji Linjiang's face was like...

122
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:26,640
Hello?

123
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:27,760
Hello?

124
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,900
Since Ji Linjiang offended Master Qi,

125
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,060
he has no chance of winning Wang Tang.

126
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,340
Master Song.

127
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,340
Congratulations, in advance.

128
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,780
Aren't you afraid Ji Linjiang will...

129
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:41,660
Yes.

130
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,540
But what else could I do?

131
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:44,860
I've stolen it anyway.

132
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,660
It's all for you.

133
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,140
What on earth do you want?

134
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,940
I want to leave Ji Linjiang

135
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,100
and come to you.

136
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,020
I never believe a dog

137
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,420
who bites its master.

138
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,020
How stupid you are!

139
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:26,980
Grandpa.

140
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,860
That was the best chance
to get Wang Tang.

141
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,860
Yet you were betrayed by a woman!

142
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,220
Don't worry.

143
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,840
I know what to do.

144
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:44,660
You did this?

145
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,060
Sister!

146
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:17,420
Are you okay?

147
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:19,500
Don't...

148
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:21,520
Ji Chan.

149
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:30,700
Sister.

150
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,040
Sister.

151
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:33,820
No!

152
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:36,740
Grandma.

153
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:37,580
Grandma!

154
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,260
Grandma!

Jingya.

157
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,240
Sister?

158
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:43,940
Jingya?

159
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,740
Why did you call Jingya Sister?

160
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:46,580
Sister.

161
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,260
Who are you?

162
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:47,940
No!

163
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:48,860
Don't leave me.

164
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,220
Don't leave me.

165
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:50,880
No!

166
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,260
Don't leave me!

167
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:04,060
It's fine.

168
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,300
Take a deep breath.

169
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:08,620
Relax.

170
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:13,560
Ji Chan,

171
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:15,560
who are you?

172
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,510
What's your relationship with the Mins?

173
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:26,740
I'm a friend of Min Jingshu.

174
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,720
No way.

175
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,080
Min Jingshu has been sickly
since she was a kid.

176
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:32,970
She has no friends

177
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:33,680
except for her sister.

178
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,860
You can't be her friend.

179
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,950
