♪I cannot live without you♪

192
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,340
Song Sipu did nothing to me.

193
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,460
Instead, he cares about me more.

194
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,420
Did he mistake me

195
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,380
for Jingya?

196
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:22,860
Grandpa.

197
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,820
You let her live in your home?

198
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,580
The scandal will simmer for a few days,

199
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,180
but soon people will forget about it.

200
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,050
You humiliated the Ji family.

201
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,620
If Lin Yaxin finds out

202
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,660
that the man she loves
is taking care of another woman,

203
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,260
Master Qi won't let you go!

204
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:40,580
By then,

205
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,780
don't implicate us.

206
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:44,580
Don't worry.

207
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:45,980
I will handle it well.

208
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,900
You will handle it well?

209
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,140
You...

210
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,620
Take her here.

211
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:54,580
Let me handle her!

212
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:58,460
If you insist on making it hard for her,

213
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,300
just punish me then.

214
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:03,740
Fine.

215
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,460
Fine!

216
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,700
Master Qi wanted
an explanation last time.

217
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,700
Today, I will punish you

218
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,140
to make him satisfied.

219
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:14,260
Guang!

220
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,140
Bring the stick here.

221
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,500
Master, please think it over.

222
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,640
It will kill him.

223
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:18,990
Get lost.

224
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,540
Let me ask you one last time.

225
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,460
Let me ask you one last time.

226
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,420
You still protect her?

227
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,060
You still protect her?

228
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,180
