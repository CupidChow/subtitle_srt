Please.

16
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:41,980
Yes.

17
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:49,980
Will you really marry me?

18
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:55,060
Yes, I will.

19
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:58,280
Then we'll tell Mr. Ji

20
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,630
the news tomorrow and ask him

21
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,660

Mr. Ji has sent another reminder.

27
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,260
They said you have to go
to the family dinner tomorrow,

28
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,380
or he...

29
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,660
Any clues about the dash cam?

30
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,460
So far we've found

31
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,580
that Master Qi secretly
kept the dash cam

32
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,660
when he disposed of the car

33
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,820
because he was worried
that Ji Linjiang would betray him.

34
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,060
What he gave to Ji Linjiang was a copy.

35
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,380
It'd be great if he had it.

36
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:15,180
We have to get this over with
before the wedding date.

37
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,500
So are you going
to the family dinner tomorrow?

38
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:34,620
Sipu.

39
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,750

when you marry me,

41
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,380
and I'll have something to fall back on.

42
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,900
It's the best thing

43
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,020

44
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,180

45
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,660
This is the first family dinner
after our engagement.

46
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,620
I want you to always remember

47
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,300
that you're my fiancée.

48
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:12,580
I know

49
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,420
you didn't want to talk about this,

50
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,260
but you promised to marry me

51
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,860
in front of Ji Chan,

52
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,900
so there's no reason
for you to back out.

53
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,420
Is this what you want to see?

54
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,140
I can't lose her again.

55
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,420
What about me?

56
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,420
This is our destiny.

I'm tired.

58
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,820
Take care of her.

62
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,140
but remember,

63
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,580
I'm the only one for you.

64
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,300
Got it?

65
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,180
Ji Linjiang.

66
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:56,420
Don't push it.

67
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,500
Let go.

68
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,900
Isn't this what you want him to see?

69
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,180
I heard you guys have a wedding date.

70
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,660

Sit down.

80
00:05:58,940 --> 00:05:59,780
Make yourself at home.

81
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,100
Okay, Mr. Ji.

82
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:10,820
Let's eat.

83
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:12,580
Okay.

84
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:35,620
Ji Chan.

85
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,820
My grandpa is good at picking dates.

86
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,460
Let's get married on the same day

87
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:41,820
as my cousin.

88
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,140
No problem.

89
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,060
We can even have
a wedding banquet together.

90
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,340
It'll be more fun that way.

91
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:59,700
How about it, Ji Chan?

92
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:05,700
Excuse me.

93
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,660
I want to go to the bathroom.

94
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,420
Ms. Ji.

95
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:01,940
What happened that night

96
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,700
is not over with me.

97
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,260
Sipu has agreed to marry me,

98
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,260
but I still have to remind you

99
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,660
that as a normal woman,

100
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,460
you should have basic principles.

101
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,340
Stay away from our lives, please.

102
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:18,900
Ms. Min.

103
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,700
I don't want to be your enemy.

104
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,580
I know,

105
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,660
but we are already hostile.

106
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,860
You, as Ji Linjiang's fiancée,

107
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,820
seduced my fiancé

108
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,580
in your room.

109
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,420
Is that how your parents taught you

110
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:35,660
to seduce other men?

111
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:42,460
I get it.

112
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,340
Is that how you made them
take pity on you

113
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,020
with this aggrieved expression?

114
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,740
It's disgusting.

115
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,820
Ms. Min.

116
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,900
You don't have to say that.

117
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,020
I just want to ask you.

118
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,260
Are you really happy

119
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:04,980
to be married to Song Sipu?

120
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,380
Of course.

121
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,140
You don't know

122
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,020
how much my marriage

123
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:11,620
to Song Sipu

124
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,620
means to me.

125
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:15,420
My sister.

126

is more important than anything.
