00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,300
we spend together.

194
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:51,860
Also,

195
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,380
her body

196
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,460
could be described
as riddled with wounds.

197
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,300
There is

198
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,220
hardly a part that is healthy.

199
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,100
It seems

200
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,980
she's basically at the stake.

201
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,140
What's more,

202
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,820
she had plastic surgery
to reconstruct her face.

203
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,380
Song Sipu is investigating me.

204
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,820
But it's not a big deal.

205
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,580
It's common now.

206
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:12,820
She...

207
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,620
Is she Jingshu?

208
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:16,780
She's alive?

209
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,020
Master.

210
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:20,540
Jing...

211
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,100
Ji Chan.

212
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,090
Master.

213
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:26,120
Watch out.

214
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:29,740
Why did you come out alone?

215
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:31,620
Your eyes haven't recovered.

216
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,480
You'd better stay in bed.

217
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,080
I...

218
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,040
I also want to know

219
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,180
the doctor's comments.

220
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:38,240
So...

221
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:40,910
Doctor.

222
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:41,870
This way, please.

223
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:43,020
Okay.

224
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:44,830
The doctor just said

225
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,240
that if your intracranial hematoma

226
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,070
is absorbed quickly,

227
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,040
you might be lucky

228
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:48,990
and recover in a few days.

229
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:50,620
When your eyes are fine...

230
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,080
What if I'm not that lucky?

231
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,180
I will be responsible
for you all my life.

232
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:09,940
In fact,

233
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,800
you don't have to be so kind to me.

234
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:15,800
During those years,

235
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,870
you have experienced

236
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,060
so many agonies alone.

237
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,860
You finally came back to me.

238
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,320
No matter what you become

239
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,380
or what your intentions are,

240
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:27,580
I don't care.

241
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,600
Let me take you back to have a rest.

242
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,340
