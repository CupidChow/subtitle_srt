00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:10,458
MORGUE

2
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,583
<i>Sir, help me!</i>

3
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:05,750
Help me, please!

4
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:08,041
<i>Hello, Jun? What is it?</i>

5
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:09,875
<i>Jun!</i>

6
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:13,958
<i>Jun!</i>

7
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:47,458
Hello.

8
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:49,125
Yes.

9
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:51,833
Okay. I'll be there.

10
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:56,250
I'm good.
I can get there by myself.

11
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:01,750
I just landed three hours ago,
but that's not an issue.

12
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,416
Yes. Now.

13
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,458
Good evening, sir.

14
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,916
FORENSIC LABORATORY CENTER

15
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:32,333
He's here.

16
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:36,666
Sorry to call you here so late, Chief.

17
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,083
What's the matter?

18
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:39,333
Probably robbery.

19
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:41,916
We're investigating what went missing.

20
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:44,458
Right. How was Malaysia?

21
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:46,125
The usual.

22
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:48,250
Paid my daughter a visit.

23
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:51,291
I thought you went home to Pekanbaru.

24
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:52,291
No.

25
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:54,791
This way.

26
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:57,166
Excuse me, Chief.

27
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:01,708
The guard's name is Alim Sujiwo.
He's only worked here for three weeks.

28
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:03,833
This building closes at 8:00 p.m.

29
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:07,541
He checked the ground floor
around half past nine.

30
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:11,250
Before the incident,

31
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:14,875
he called the head of security for help.

32
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,458
He sounded terrified.

33
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:19,708
He didn't get to explain anything.

34
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:21,416
Then I heard glass breaking.

35
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:23,458
He was all by himself?

36
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:25,875
Yes, Chief.
Only one guard works the night shift.

37
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:28,458
For a lab as vital as forensics…

38
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:30,041
Only one guard?

39
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,041
How reckless.

40
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:44,375
Any theft or any missing items?

41
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:47,166
None so far. Except one.

42
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:52,875
One of the bodies went missing, Chief.

43
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,500
A body of a female disappeared.
Sofia Arini.

44
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:07,958
Cause of death, cardiac arrest.
No autopsy yet.

45
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:10,708
Who was the doctor in charge?

46
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:14,000
Doctor Nadia, Chief. Just the one.

47
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:15,250
We've contacted her.

48
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:19,125
TOE TAG - DECEASED
SOFIA ARINI - 50 - FEMALE

49
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:25,041
All the cameras are off but one.
Why is that?

50
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:27,125
Maybe he messed up.

51
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:29,916
Or maybe someone's messing with us.

52
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:36,541
Meaning a group of burglars
came to pick that body up.

53
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:41,083
Are you sure nobody broke in here?

54
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:44,708
Affirmative, sir.
We only have one problem.

55
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:48,291
We couldn't get into the control room
because the passcode was changed.

56
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:52,250
Chief, the forensic team is here.

57
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,458
Go see them.

58
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:55,583
Got it, Chief.

59
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,000
Julie.

60
00:06:58,541 --> 00:06:59,708
Give me the details.

61
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:01,416
Who went missing?

62
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,166
Sofia Arini.

63
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:08,333
Fifty years old, married to Jefri Adam.

64
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:13,041
No children.
Just got back from Berlin on business

65
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:15,458
before finally being found dead.

66
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:17,166
An amazing woman.

67
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,375
ID NUMBER - NAME - ADDRESS
OCCUPATION - SEX

68
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:46,541
Be strong, Jef.

69
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:49,041
We all miss Sofia.

70
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,125
We should get going.

71
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:53,416
Go get yourself some rest.

72
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:15,625
Babe, why are you here?

73
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,583
I've missed you, baby.

74
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:24,708
You can always give me a call.

75
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:32,250
What?

76
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:34,166
You can always give me a call.

77
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:37,250
I don't feel comfortable there.

78
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:40,791
I'm fed up
with all the fake crying all day.

79
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,208
Yeah, I know. But…

80
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:49,083
But what if someone notices
you coming here?

81
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:52,791
Nobody will notice.
I made sure everything's fine.

82
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:56,125
I swear.

83
00:09:57,958 --> 00:09:59,208
Come here.

84
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:07,166
What's wrong?

85
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:15,833
Hey.

86
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,750
I did this for you.

87
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:21,875
For us.

88
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,000
We're safe now.

89
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:29,166
We can be together openly.

90
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:35,708
Don't beat yourself up over it.

91
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:39,791
Okay.

92
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:43,833
I'm thirsty.
Could you get me a drink?

93
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:45,041
One second.

94
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:04,583
You're not answering?

95
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,250
Just someone saying condolences.

96
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:13,500
This late?

97
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:23,166
Hello. Yes.

98
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:25,000
Yes, speaking.

99
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:26,958
Oh, right.

100
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:30,791
About that.

101
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:33,916
I provided all the details
to your partner this afternoon.

102
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:39,083
Disappeared?

103
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:41,916
What do you mean disappeared?

104
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:44,750
Of course.

105
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,166
Okay, I'll be there.

106
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:49,541
Okay.

107
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:51,125
Who was it?

108
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:54,916
The police.

109
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,125
What do they want?

110
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:59,541
They said Sofia's body disappeared
from the morgue.

111
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:02,583
She's really dead, right?

112
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:05,125
Yeah, she… She's dead, baby.

113
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:08,333
Are you sure?

114
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:11,166
I am. Totally.

115
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:14,458
I did it myself.
I made sure it worked.

116
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:15,916
So how could she go missing?

117
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:25,833
Babe.

118
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:27,833
Don't go.

119
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:31,666
What if they're suspicious
and they question you?

120
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,458
The doctor declared a heart attack.

121
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:36,125
A normal death.
There's nothing to be suspicious of.

122
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:38,416
The thing is,

123
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:40,166
if I don't go,

124
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:42,208
they really will suspect me.

125
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:51,375
Good evening.

126
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:55,291
Sorry to summon you here this late
with unpleasant news.

127
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:02,625
So how did my wife's body go missing?

128
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,041
Our first hypothesis,

129
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:09,083
someone stole your wife's body.

130
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:12,083
This is
the Police Forensic Laboratory Center.

131
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,166
Is there no security here?

132
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,500
24 hour surveillance.

133
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:17,958
Complete with cameras.

134
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:19,666
Strangely, they're all turned off.

135
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:22,791
The guard got spooked
and was rushed to the ICU.

136
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:25,541
As if he saw the undead.

137
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:31,750
- So there's no logical explanation?
- There is.

138
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:35,666
The thief is possibly
part of an organ trafficking syndicate.

139
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,333
Or they used black magic.

140
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:41,791
But if it's the former,
they'd steal more than just one body.

141
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:49,000
Did your wife have enemies?

142
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:52,333
I don't think so.

143
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:53,875
But she…

144
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:58,000
She owned the country's
largest pharmaceutical company.

145
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:00,125
She must've had rivals.

146
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,125
I'll set the record straight.

147
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:07,416
When it comes to business,
undoubtedly so.

148
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,666
There are countless new companies
that tried to copy our products.

149
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:14,666
But enemies…

150
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:18,958
Especially someone who would go
so far as to steal her body…

151
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:20,291
I don't think so.

152
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:26,375
How about you?

153
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:28,291
Do you have enemies?

154
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:32,583
Someone who would take revenge
on your loved ones?

155
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:35,916
I don't have enemies.

156
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:41,708
Fine. If it's not you, then…

157
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:45,000
could be some other family member.

158
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:48,250
Go ask Sofia's family.

159
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,500
- She had two siblings.
- We have.

160
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,250
We've talked to them.

161
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:55,291
- Before me?
- Yes.

162
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,541
They even

163
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:03,791
told us about
your prenuptial agreement.

164
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:08,291
We clearly should've talked to you first.

165
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:12,583
But you weren't home at the time, and…

166
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:14,916
they gave us your number.

167
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,750
I went out for a while.

168
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:20,208
I went to buy medicine.

169
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:22,583
I've had a terrible headache all day.

170
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,333
Feeling better now?

171
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:25,708
Absolutely.

172
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:28,375
May I see the medicine you bought?

173
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:57,375
Excuse me, Chief.
Doctor Nadia is here.

174
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:02,166
Excuse me.
We'll pick up where we left off.

175
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:40,250
Yes?

176
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,208
I need your help.

177
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,333
- What?
<i>- The guard who worked at this place.</i>

178
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:45,333
They said he's in the ICU.

179
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:49,500
I think he's in the nearest hospital
from here, Mitra Jasa.

180
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:51,541
<i>- You have friends there, right?</i>
- I do.

181
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,458
I intern there.

182
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:55,458
Find out who the guard is

183
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:57,500
<i>and what he saw that terrified him.</i>

184
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,125
Okay, I'll try.

185
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:01,166
<i>How are you holding up there?</i>

186
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,750
I'm fine. Don't worry about me.

187
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,000
Call you later. I love you.

188
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,291
No smoking on the premises.

189
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:28,708
I thought you'd make exceptions
in situations like these.

190
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:34,708
Our forensic pathologist
would like a word.

191
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:40,416
Your wife just came back
from Berlin, correct?

192
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:42,000
Yes, correct.

193
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:48,750
This states that your wife
had aerophobia, fear of flying.

194
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,750
Yes. She'd already seen a psychiatrist.

195
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:56,166
And I reckon she managed to get over it.

196
00:17:58,125 --> 00:17:59,666
Did you know

197
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:03,791
stress from long flights
can lead to cardiac arrest?

198
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:08,833
Do you think
that's what killed my wife?

199
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:12,708
Could be.
We still haven't made a conclusion.

200
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:15,833
- Anything hereditary?
- No.

201
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:17,458
Asthma, perhaps? Diabetes?

202
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:24,208
What does her medical record
have to do with her body's disappearance?

203
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:27,291
I'm looking from a medical perspective.

204
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:30,750
With her record, I'm…

205
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:33,458
suggesting that it might be…

206
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,583
catalepsy.

207
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:37,916
Catalepsy?

208
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:40,250
Suspended animation.

209
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:50,333
One moment.

210
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,583
Are you sure it's catalepsy?

211
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:58,041
It was me who received
the body when it arrived

212
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:00,958
and it was me
who issued the death certificate.

213
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:03,416
I examined the body properly.

214
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,750
In that case, wouldn't it be weird
if she just up and disappeared?

215
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:12,541
With her in the compartment,
she would've screamed for help.

216
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:13,666
That's true.

217
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:16,583
It would make more sense
if someone came here

218
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:18,625
and stole the body.

219
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:19,541
Fine.

220
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:23,083
Forget about the whole
catalepsy hypothesis.

221
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:28,666
There's a criminology theory that says

222
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:34,041
all deaths are homicide
until proven otherwise.

223
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:37,291
Cardiac arrest can be induced.

224
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:42,375
By putting someone
under high psychological pressure

225
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:47,041
or inserting something
in the body that causes cardiac arrest.

226
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:52,625
That said,
there's only one way to prove it.

227
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:55,500
Autopsy.

228
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:59,083
If there's no body,

229
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:01,791
there's no autopsy.

230
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:16,750
Sorry, Nad.

231
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:20,500
For making you work
in the middle of this rainy night.

232
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:25,583
Lio told me

233
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:29,708
you just got back from Malaysia.

234
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:31,250
Paid Lidya a visit?

235
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:35,125
How's school for her?

236
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:39,666
Finished college.

237
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,875
She just got a job.

238
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,416
Is she well?

239
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:47,916
All good.

240
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:21,375
Hey, your dad is here.

241
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:24,416
- Hi, Dad! Hello!
- Hello!

242
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,666
She's taken her little bath!

243
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:30,458
- Smells nice, doesn't she?
- She does.

244
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:34,833
<i>Blow out the candles</i>

245
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:36,375
Blow out the candle.

246
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:39,708
Yay! Clap your hands!

247
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:42,458
Lidya!

248
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:49,583
We are now in Bandung.

249
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:52,458
That there is our new home.

250
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:57,166
You must be exhausted.

251
00:21:58,208 --> 00:21:59,958
Thanks for the ride.

252
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,208
- It's green.
- Yeah.

253
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:33,166
When will you stop carrying
that guilt everywhere you go?

254
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,958
You need to stop for yourself.

255
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:39,416
For your daughter.

256
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:48,125
I remember that night.

257
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:53,708
It felt just like tonight.

258
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
The exact same date as today.

259
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:13,916
Mr. Jefri, where are you going?

260
00:23:14,666 --> 00:23:16,125
Please go back inside.

261
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:18,208
What do you still need me for?

262
00:23:18,708 --> 00:23:20,291
We're not done investigating.

263
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:22,333
How much do you need?

264
00:23:22,416 --> 00:23:24,208
All of you. Name your price.

265
00:23:24,291 --> 00:23:25,416
Yes, yes.

266
00:23:26,791 --> 00:23:30,083
But I'm afraid I'm still
going to need you to wait inside.

267
00:23:30,166 --> 00:23:31,791
What time is it?

268
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:34,291
I'm still in mourning.

269
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:36,625
What are you holding me back for?

270
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:37,583
Yes, yes.

271
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:40,000
Get your boss here right now.

272
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:41,708
We'll have a little chat.

273
00:23:41,791 --> 00:23:43,166
Get this over with.

274
00:23:47,166 --> 00:23:48,000
What now?

275
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,291
You should wait inside, Mr. Jefri.

276
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:51,875
Hey, you two! Come here!

277
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,791
Bambang, Hardi,
go check the electrical panel.

278
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:00,500
- Go, get a move on!
- Yes, sir.

279
00:24:50,958 --> 00:24:52,416
T-800.

280
00:25:10,333 --> 00:25:12,458
We're working with the Germans.

281
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,375
They're going to invest in us,
so let's celebrate, come on.

282
00:25:16,458 --> 00:25:17,625
Later, okay?

283
00:25:17,708 --> 00:25:19,333
I'll arrange our dinner tonight.

284
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,041
I have to go to work.

285
00:25:21,125 --> 00:25:23,750
We haven't seen each other for five days.

286
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,500
You can skip work just for today.

287
00:25:27,833 --> 00:25:32,208
I just want to talk to you.
Hear your stories and be all romantic.

288
00:25:32,291 --> 00:25:34,791
Let's spend today just the two of us.

289
00:25:34,875 --> 00:25:36,375
I have a meeting, Sof.

290
00:25:39,916 --> 00:25:41,375
Jefri Adam.

291
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:46,416
The director of my family's company.

292
00:25:48,208 --> 00:25:53,833
You can arrange your meetings
or whatever however you like.

293
00:25:54,375 --> 00:25:58,250
Even if you don't go to work,
who's going to fire you?

294
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:01,250
Oh, right.

295
00:26:02,458 --> 00:26:03,291
Me.

296
00:26:05,166 --> 00:26:08,583
Only I can fire you anytime, honey.

297
00:26:09,291 --> 00:26:11,041
I'm sick of this kind of joke.

298
00:26:13,666 --> 00:26:14,916
I work with all my heart.

299
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:19,208
My field of work is in fact
the science that I mastered.

300
00:26:19,291 --> 00:26:22,416
I got here
not because I'm merely your husband.

301
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,958
Sure.
That's why I put you in this position.

302
00:26:27,208 --> 00:26:29,083
Pharmacy is indeed your field.

303
00:26:29,166 --> 00:26:30,583
But also…

304
00:26:32,166 --> 00:26:34,166
So you won't be a lecturer forever.

305
00:26:35,875 --> 00:26:38,000
Pure chemistry lectures? Come on.

306
00:26:40,916 --> 00:26:43,708
- Can you live like this with your salary?
- Enough, Sof!

307
00:26:45,291 --> 00:26:49,541
I'm not leaving for the office upset
because of your condescending remarks.

308
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,333
See you later.

309
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:33,083
What are you doing here?

310
00:27:33,166 --> 00:27:35,583
I heard a noise here,
so I came to check it out.

311
00:27:39,041 --> 00:27:40,208
Chief.

312
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:44,208
Power went out. Either deliberately
turned off or a short circuit.

313
00:27:44,291 --> 00:27:45,541
They're looking into it.

314
00:27:51,833 --> 00:27:53,208
What's this doing here?

315
00:27:53,291 --> 00:27:55,333
These belonged to the body.

316
00:27:55,416 --> 00:27:57,875
This box was supposed to be…

317
00:28:00,708 --> 00:28:02,041
in the locker.

318
00:28:06,125 --> 00:28:08,291
Mr. Jefri, please move out of the way.

319
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:22,458
It's broken open.

320
00:28:30,541 --> 00:28:33,166
Everything is here but the phone.

321
00:28:35,916 --> 00:28:37,041
I didn't take anything.

322
00:28:37,125 --> 00:28:39,125
Did one of the bodies just get up then?

323
00:28:39,916 --> 00:28:42,375
They got bored,
decided to see what's up online?

324
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,250
Empty your pockets.

325
00:28:45,291 --> 00:28:48,166
Why would I steal my own wife's phone?

326
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:50,166
Mr. Jefri, please.

327
00:29:00,041 --> 00:29:01,083
My phone.

328
00:29:03,666 --> 00:29:04,875
Is that everything?

329
00:29:05,791 --> 00:29:07,958
- Hands up.
- For what?

330
00:29:08,041 --> 00:29:10,041
Hands up. This is a frisk.

331
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:13,166
- I'm not going to--
- Hands up, you bastard!

332
00:29:13,791 --> 00:29:14,833
Let me go!

333
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:18,375
- I can sue you!
- Silence!

334
00:29:18,458 --> 00:29:20,666
Sir. Mr. Arya.

335
00:29:22,708 --> 00:29:23,791
Mr. Arya.

336
00:29:26,541 --> 00:29:28,541
What's this?

337
00:29:30,958 --> 00:29:32,458
I don't know. Found it here.

338
00:29:33,125 --> 00:29:36,083
It has your company logo.

339
00:29:36,166 --> 00:29:37,708
Our products are publicly sold.

340
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,375
And this is a forensic laboratory.

341
00:29:40,875 --> 00:29:42,791
It's not weird seeing our product here.

342
00:29:43,666 --> 00:29:45,083
What is T-800?

343
00:29:45,958 --> 00:29:47,208
Some kind of toxin.

344
00:29:47,291 --> 00:29:48,791
What kind of toxin?

345
00:29:48,875 --> 00:29:49,958
I don't know.

346
00:29:50,041 --> 00:29:53,000
- We make toxins for medical use.
- What use?

347
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:54,291
Plenty of them.

348
00:29:55,375 --> 00:29:58,041
It's not within my expertise to explain.

349
00:30:06,375 --> 00:30:07,250
Answer it.

350
00:30:13,208 --> 00:30:14,166
It's my sister.

351
00:30:18,916 --> 00:30:19,833
Yes?

352
00:30:21,791 --> 00:30:23,416
Jef, I found it.

353
00:30:24,416 --> 00:30:25,541
The name of the guard

354
00:30:25,625 --> 00:30:27,416
<i>is Alim Sujiwo.</i>

355
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,833
<i>I'm at the hospital now.</i>

356
00:30:28,916 --> 00:30:30,791
Yeah, I'm still here.

357
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,458
Sofia's body is still missing.

358
00:30:33,541 --> 00:30:37,041
But they promise to keep looking for her.

359
00:30:37,791 --> 00:30:39,208
What's with you?

360
00:30:39,291 --> 00:30:40,958
<i>Are you being watched?</i>

361
00:30:41,041 --> 00:30:42,375
Yes, call you later.

362
00:30:42,458 --> 00:30:43,500
<i>Bye.</i>

363
00:30:45,583 --> 00:30:47,791
My sister. She's worried.

364
00:30:48,625 --> 00:30:50,166
Asked me when will I get home.

365
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,250
Anything else I can help with?

366
00:30:52,958 --> 00:30:55,666
You're going to need
to write a statement letter,

367
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:56,833
then you can go.

368
00:30:56,916 --> 00:30:58,375
Can I use the toilet first?

369
00:32:15,541 --> 00:32:17,291
Mrs. Sofia Arini…

370
00:32:18,583 --> 00:32:20,000
Jefri Adam.

371
00:32:38,416 --> 00:32:42,750
"Every time I close my eyes,
All I see is you."

372
00:33:01,958 --> 00:33:02,916
Where have you been?

373
00:33:03,583 --> 00:33:05,250
We're supposed to go to a dinner.

374
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:10,750
There was trouble at the lab.

375
00:33:18,875 --> 00:33:20,500
Penny said you weren't at the lab.

376
00:33:20,583 --> 00:33:23,000
You weren't in your office since lunch.

377
00:33:23,083 --> 00:33:24,500
I went out for lunch.

378
00:33:25,708 --> 00:33:27,083
Didn't say a word to Penny.

379
00:33:27,791 --> 00:33:30,083
After lunch,
I checked samples in several labs.

380
00:33:30,166 --> 00:33:31,708
I called, why didn't you answer?

381
00:33:31,791 --> 00:33:32,833
Phone was in my bag.

382
00:33:32,916 --> 00:33:35,291
Left it in the car. No idea you called.

383
00:33:37,291 --> 00:33:38,916
- I'll go take a shower.
- Wait.

384
00:33:41,625 --> 00:33:44,125
Wear the gray suit I bought you.

385
00:33:44,666 --> 00:33:46,208
You look great in that.

386
00:33:48,041 --> 00:33:49,708
I prefer the black one.

387
00:33:49,791 --> 00:33:51,666
Do you have a problem with me?

388
00:33:52,708 --> 00:33:54,041
I don't.

389
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:57,125
I'm just tired from work and need rest.

390
00:33:59,291 --> 00:34:00,416
Say it.

391
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,916
Say you still love me.

392
00:34:08,541 --> 00:34:09,750
I love you.

393
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:13,500
Jef, I'm not losing you, am I?

394
00:34:20,041 --> 00:34:21,666
We'll always be together.

395
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:43,041
EVERY TIME I CLOSE MY EYES,
ALL I SEE IS YOU.

396
00:34:59,375 --> 00:35:01,500
EVERY TIME I CLOSE MY EYES,
ALL I SEE IS YOU.

397
00:35:06,041 --> 00:35:07,666
- Not done yet?
- Not yet, sir.

398
00:35:13,791 --> 00:35:15,166
Fine then, I'll take over.

399
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:16,416
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah.

400
00:35:23,541 --> 00:35:25,000
Mr. Jefri!

401
00:35:25,083 --> 00:35:26,541
What's taking so long?

402
00:35:32,541 --> 00:35:33,583
Sir.

403
00:35:35,041 --> 00:35:37,166
You're not allowed to smoke here.

404
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:38,500
Mr. Jefri!

405
00:35:38,583 --> 00:35:40,458
My stomach is churning. Hold on.

406
00:35:40,541 --> 00:35:42,208
You need to come with me.

407
00:35:42,291 --> 00:35:43,666
We have an update.

408
00:35:45,208 --> 00:35:46,250
Sir.

409
00:35:48,875 --> 00:35:50,833
- Mr. Jefri.
- Just hang on!

410
00:35:50,916 --> 00:35:52,541
You can't smoke here.

411
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:56,166
The smoke detector will go off
and you'll get us all drenched.

412
00:35:59,666 --> 00:36:00,708
Mr. Jefri.

413
00:36:03,666 --> 00:36:04,583
Sir!

414
00:36:05,916 --> 00:36:06,958
Sir!

415
00:36:11,291 --> 00:36:12,625
Mr. Jefri!

416
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:15,625
What's taking you so long?

417
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,541
- Sir, hurry up!
- One second.

418
00:36:34,916 --> 00:36:37,666
- Mr. Jefri!
- One second!

419
00:36:41,041 --> 00:36:42,083
Mr. Jefri.

420
00:36:48,583 --> 00:36:49,625
Yeah.

421
00:36:53,416 --> 00:36:54,541
What's the update?

422
00:36:57,291 --> 00:36:58,541
We have a new lead.

423
00:37:08,875 --> 00:37:10,458
So, can we get it open yet?

424
00:37:10,541 --> 00:37:12,666
Yes, sir.
We have reset the entire system.

425
00:37:13,208 --> 00:37:14,041
Go ahead, sir.

426
00:37:14,875 --> 00:37:16,166
Chief.

427
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:18,875
- Why am I here?
- This is the control room.

428
00:37:20,166 --> 00:37:24,000
All the electrical and security systems
of the building are controlled from here.

429
00:37:24,083 --> 00:37:25,541
Including the cameras.

430
00:37:27,375 --> 00:37:30,625
However, there's a part of this building
that's easy to break into.

431
00:37:33,416 --> 00:37:34,625
This vent.

432
00:37:36,541 --> 00:37:38,750
They tore the grid from both sides.

433
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:44,416
And this vent would lead us to the woods.

434
00:37:46,833 --> 00:37:49,000
Our team is looking into it.

435
00:37:53,958 --> 00:37:58,333
Maybe they came through this hole here,
cut off the cameras,

436
00:37:58,416 --> 00:38:00,125
and then stole the body.

437
00:38:00,208 --> 00:38:03,125
Excuse me, ma'am. We found a new trail.

438
00:38:04,416 --> 00:38:07,541
<i>January 10, 2024.</i>
<i>Does that mean anything to you?</i>

439
00:38:10,458 --> 00:38:12,083
Nothing. Why?

440
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:16,000
Somebody changed today's date.

441
00:38:18,375 --> 00:38:20,083
Set us back by eight months.

442
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:28,583
The culprit most likely did it.

443
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,125
From here…

444
00:38:35,541 --> 00:38:38,625
access to the morgue is through this door.

445
00:38:39,791 --> 00:38:43,291
A door only accessible via a passcode.

446
00:38:44,291 --> 00:38:47,333
If the perpetrator can hack the system,

447
00:38:48,083 --> 00:38:50,625
why would they change the passcode…

448
00:38:52,166 --> 00:38:55,041
into a specific set of numbers?

449
00:38:56,416 --> 00:38:57,333
10…

450
00:38:58,125 --> 00:38:59,375
01…

451
00:39:00,916 --> 00:39:02,041
24.

452
00:39:33,416 --> 00:39:34,416
Hey.

453
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:37,708
Goodness, Sofia.
I could've had a heart attack!

454
00:39:37,791 --> 00:39:39,166
Please don't.

455
00:39:42,041 --> 00:39:43,250
How did you get here?

456
00:39:44,375 --> 00:39:46,416
Penny said you'd be here.

457
00:39:48,125 --> 00:39:49,916
Wait, I need to write this down.

458
00:39:56,583 --> 00:39:57,791
I saw you earlier.

459
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:03,250
- Saw me what?
- Punching in the passcode.

460
00:40:07,916 --> 00:40:09,666
Why did you pick that date?

461
00:40:10,583 --> 00:40:11,875
You assume it's a date.

462
00:40:13,666 --> 00:40:18,500
Jefri, my love,
you use dates for all your passcodes.

463
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:21,416
Emails, safes, ATMs, doors at home.

464
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:24,166
They're all dates,
even the unpleasant ones.

465
00:40:31,375 --> 00:40:34,541
Whoever did it,
they must've used this freight elevator.

466
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:38,958
This goes almost directly to the morgue.

467
00:40:40,416 --> 00:40:43,875
It's made to ferry bodies. Come in.

468
00:40:45,708 --> 00:40:46,666
Okay.

469
00:40:47,333 --> 00:40:49,875
We've already figured out
the method and the access.

470
00:40:49,958 --> 00:40:51,166
Now to find the culprit.

471
00:40:52,458 --> 00:40:54,166
We're going to find out soon.

472
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:00,500
Okay.

473
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:02,625
Any leads who did it?

474
00:41:03,625 --> 00:41:05,958
We just found footprints.

475
00:41:06,041 --> 00:41:08,125
<i>They seemingly wore running shoes.</i>

476
00:41:08,208 --> 00:41:12,708
<i>They moved from the woods</i>
<i>through the vent to the control room.</i>

477
00:41:14,708 --> 00:41:16,208
What is your shoe size?

478
00:41:20,375 --> 00:41:22,166
What is your shoe size?

479
00:41:29,166 --> 00:41:31,208
Forty-three.

480
00:41:39,958 --> 00:41:41,000
Lio.

481
00:41:41,958 --> 00:41:43,250
Monitor, monitor.

482
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:46,083
This is Lio with Mr. Arya in the elevator.

483
00:41:46,166 --> 00:41:48,041
We suddenly stopped. What's going on?

484
00:41:52,791 --> 00:41:55,791
Chief, a fire activated the fire alarm.

485
00:41:55,875 --> 00:41:59,041
Okay, everyone, to the lobby!

486
00:41:59,125 --> 00:42:00,166
Yes, Chief!

487
00:42:25,458 --> 00:42:26,875
Gosh, shit.

488
00:42:30,541 --> 00:42:32,458
- Hello, Sarah.
<i>- Are you still there?</i>

489
00:42:32,541 --> 00:42:33,875
I can't speak right now.

490
00:42:33,958 --> 00:42:36,083
<i>- Where are you?</i>
- Hospital parking lot.

491
00:42:36,166 --> 00:42:37,541
I saw the calendar.

492
00:42:37,625 --> 00:42:40,833
The date was changed
to the day we first met.

493
00:42:40,916 --> 00:42:43,791
What calendar?
What's that got to do with us?

494
00:42:45,625 --> 00:42:46,541
<i>Jef?</i>

495
00:42:51,666 --> 00:42:52,583
Jef?

496
00:42:53,291 --> 00:42:55,166
<i>Hello? Are you still there?</i>

497
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:57,083
SARAH ARUDITA, FEMALE, 20

498
00:42:57,166 --> 00:43:01,166
<i>Did you kill me because of Sarah, Jef?</i>

499
00:43:01,958 --> 00:43:03,625
<i>Jef.</i>

500
00:43:09,875 --> 00:43:14,291
<i>My dear Jefri.</i>

501
00:43:22,875 --> 00:43:25,333
<i>I can feel her presence.</i>

502
00:43:25,416 --> 00:43:27,166
Sofia is still alive.

503
00:43:28,166 --> 00:43:30,750
<i>Now she's messing with us.</i>

504
00:43:30,833 --> 00:43:32,958
You said you perfectly
carried out your plan.

505
00:43:33,041 --> 00:43:35,333
I don't know
how she came back to life either!

506
00:43:35,416 --> 00:43:37,041
How do you know she did?

507
00:43:37,625 --> 00:43:39,166
"Every time I close my eyes,

508
00:43:40,541 --> 00:43:41,875
all I see is you."

509
00:43:46,541 --> 00:43:49,708
<i>She knew you sent that message to me.</i>

510
00:43:50,291 --> 00:43:51,625
She checked your phone?

511
00:43:52,875 --> 00:43:54,208
You didn't delete it?

512
00:43:54,291 --> 00:43:57,083
Point is, if she knows you're involved,

513
00:43:57,166 --> 00:43:59,416
you're in danger, Sarah!

514
00:44:01,625 --> 00:44:02,791
And now

515
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:07,041
she made it as if I stole her body.

516
00:44:08,041 --> 00:44:10,833
But is she really capable of doing that?

517
00:44:10,916 --> 00:44:12,250
Not by herself.

518
00:44:12,333 --> 00:44:13,333
Enough, Jef.

519
00:44:13,416 --> 00:44:15,041
You better get out of there.

520
00:44:15,125 --> 00:44:16,291
<i>Let's run away together.</i>

521
00:44:19,041 --> 00:44:20,666
<i>- Jefri?</i>
- Sarah, Sarah.

522
00:44:21,333 --> 00:44:23,416
I'll call you later. Love you.

523
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:24,541
<i>Jef.</i>

524
00:44:26,041 --> 00:44:27,375
If I have to take a guess…

525
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:30,291
That must be your sister.

526
00:44:30,375 --> 00:44:31,416
Yes.

527
00:44:33,125 --> 00:44:35,041
Asked me to come home.
She's worried.

528
00:44:36,458 --> 00:44:38,750
Your phone, please.

529
00:44:57,875 --> 00:45:00,666
We got nothing
out of the phone, sir.

530
00:45:01,375 --> 00:45:04,041
He deleted
all the incoming and outgoing calls.

531
00:45:04,125 --> 00:45:07,083
We can't find out who his last call was.

532
00:45:07,166 --> 00:45:08,166
We found this.

533
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:11,916
Any updates from the others?

534
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,166
K9 is still following the footprints
into the woods on the other side.

535
00:45:17,916 --> 00:45:20,375
Forensic team found
a cigarette butt in the toilet.

536
00:45:20,458 --> 00:45:23,708
Sloppily discarded,
resulting in triggering the fire alarm.

537
00:45:23,791 --> 00:45:25,375
That's certainly his.

538
00:45:25,458 --> 00:45:28,625
When I came to pick him up
in the toilet, I smelled cigarette.

539
00:45:28,708 --> 00:45:31,750
And now the floor in every room
is drenched.

540
00:45:32,791 --> 00:45:35,041
This will make tracing impossible.

541
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:37,125
That bastard!

542
00:45:38,041 --> 00:45:40,166
He's trying to wipe up evidence.

543
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:43,916
I received a report from the lab.

544
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,000
The T-800 serum is some sort of poison
that induces cardiac arrest.

545
00:45:51,875 --> 00:45:55,208
Concocted from the venom
of various reptiles.

546
00:45:55,291 --> 00:45:56,875
It dissolves in blood,

547
00:45:56,958 --> 00:46:00,625
stops the heart within eight hours, and…

548
00:46:03,333 --> 00:46:04,375
leaves no trace.

549
00:46:04,875 --> 00:46:06,291
Get the custody van ready.

550
00:46:06,375 --> 00:46:08,416
I'm transferring him to headquarters.

551
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:09,416
Yes, Chief.

552
00:46:11,791 --> 00:46:14,333
I want him confined and heavily guarded.

553
00:46:14,416 --> 00:46:15,416
Yes, Chief.

554
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:16,458
- Lio.
- Yes.

555
00:46:16,541 --> 00:46:18,250
- Confiscate his cigarettes.
- Got it.

556
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,125
Is it locked?

557
00:46:45,833 --> 00:46:47,208
All done.

558
00:46:47,291 --> 00:46:48,833
Where would he run off to?

559
00:46:48,916 --> 00:46:50,916
Next door is the morgue anyway.

560
00:47:21,541 --> 00:47:24,416
<i>Who's Sarah, Jef?</i>

561
00:48:06,166 --> 00:48:08,583
<i>Can you come pick me up, Jef?</i>

562
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,375
Honey.

563
00:48:30,458 --> 00:48:32,083
We'll be together forever, right?

564
00:51:00,041 --> 00:51:01,166
Sofia?

565
00:51:09,166 --> 00:51:10,083
Hello?

566
00:51:22,666 --> 00:51:24,666
DANI AGUSTINUS, 50, MALE

567
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:42,291
Who's that?

568
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:44,916
Who's that?

569
00:51:45,666 --> 00:51:46,666
Nobody.

570
00:51:47,375 --> 00:51:49,916
A nobody that came here just for you?

571
00:51:51,625 --> 00:51:54,041
Okay, if you must know,

572
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:56,041
he's my lawyer.

573
00:51:56,125 --> 00:51:56,958
For what?

574
00:51:57,041 --> 00:51:59,666
To review the clauses in our prenup.

575
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:02,000
Are they legally binding?

576
00:52:02,083 --> 00:52:02,958
Which clause?

577
00:52:03,041 --> 00:52:04,708
Asset distribution.

578
00:52:04,791 --> 00:52:08,500
In case of infidelity or divorce.

579
00:52:11,041 --> 00:52:12,541
Why are you overthinking?

580
00:52:14,916 --> 00:52:16,541
It's like you're accusing me.

581
00:52:16,625 --> 00:52:18,875
It's not an accusation if I have proof.

582
00:52:20,708 --> 00:52:22,791
It's up to you to admit it or not.

583
00:52:33,125 --> 00:52:35,250
Why the serious face? I was joking.

584
00:52:37,125 --> 00:52:39,541
I wish I recorded your face.

585
00:52:41,166 --> 00:52:42,125
It's not funny, Sof.

586
00:52:44,625 --> 00:52:46,416
If he's not a lawyer, then who is he?

587
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:49,750
Dr. Dani Agustinus, a psychiatrist.

588
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:51,833
I didn't know
you're seeing a psychiatrist.

589
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:55,625
I've only had a few sessions.

590
00:52:57,125 --> 00:52:59,416
I want to take care
of my mental health too.

591
00:53:46,833 --> 00:53:48,833
Sofia?

592
00:53:48,916 --> 00:53:49,750
This isn't Sofia.

593
00:53:50,166 --> 00:53:51,541
But her phone is here.

594
00:53:51,625 --> 00:53:52,666
<i>When will she get it?</i>

595
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:54,833
- Get it where?
- Monomono restaurant.

596
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:58,750
How did my wife's phone end up there?

597
00:53:58,833 --> 00:54:00,500
No clue, sir.

598
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:03,041
It was found in the restroom

599
00:54:03,125 --> 00:54:05,250
<i>by the cleaners. Maybe Mrs. Sofia</i>

600
00:54:05,333 --> 00:54:07,708
was in a rush and forgot it.

601
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:09,333
My wife is dead.

602
00:54:11,291 --> 00:54:13,500
Someone must've put it there on purpose.

603
00:54:14,166 --> 00:54:15,208
<i>But…</i>

604
00:54:16,041 --> 00:54:19,500
It's possible my wife
was at your restaurant last night

605
00:54:19,583 --> 00:54:22,333
<i>and intentionally left her phone there.</i>

606
00:54:23,458 --> 00:54:26,125
Wait, what?
I thought you said she's dead.

607
00:54:26,208 --> 00:54:28,541
Well, she could still be alive.

608
00:54:28,625 --> 00:54:30,916
<i>Sir, I'm so sorry.</i>

609
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,833
I'd rather stay out of
your personal matters.

610
00:54:33,916 --> 00:54:36,208
Again, if you want to collect
Mrs. Sofia's phone,

611
00:54:36,291 --> 00:54:39,541
<i>please come to Monomono Restaurant.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

612
00:54:40,666 --> 00:54:41,875
Hello?

613
00:54:56,958 --> 00:54:57,791
<i>Hello?</i>

614
00:54:57,875 --> 00:54:59,458
Babe, it's me.

615
00:54:59,541 --> 00:55:01,083
<i>The cops took my phone.</i>

616
00:55:01,166 --> 00:55:03,125
I'm stuck in the autopsy room,

617
00:55:03,666 --> 00:55:05,625
and I found this phone.

618
00:55:06,291 --> 00:55:08,791
I think someone did this on purpose.

619
00:55:08,875 --> 00:55:09,875
Did what on purpose?

620
00:55:10,541 --> 00:55:11,750
The only number

621
00:55:14,041 --> 00:55:15,708
saved in this phone

622
00:55:15,791 --> 00:55:16,916
<i>is Sofia's.</i>

623
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,041
- So whose phone is this?
- Dani Agustinus'.

624
00:55:21,416 --> 00:55:25,291
I met him a few weeks ago
before Sofia went to Berlin.

625
00:55:25,375 --> 00:55:29,333
<i>Sofia said Dani Agustinus</i>
<i>was her psychiatrist, but I doubt it.</i>

626
00:55:29,416 --> 00:55:30,458
<i>I'm sure she lied.</i>

627
00:55:30,541 --> 00:55:31,958
I need your help.

628
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:35,416
Find out who this Agustinus really is.

629
00:55:35,916 --> 00:55:37,625
Where did you get this phone?

630
00:55:39,208 --> 00:55:40,041
At…

631
00:55:40,875 --> 00:55:41,791
the morgue.

632
00:55:46,083 --> 00:55:47,291
Dani Agustinus…

633
00:55:48,166 --> 00:55:49,500
<i>is dead.</i>

634
00:55:58,166 --> 00:55:59,333
Sir.

635
00:55:59,416 --> 00:56:02,000
I found an interesting clause
in the prenup.

636
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:23,791
Please.

637
00:56:23,875 --> 00:56:24,791
Thanks.

638
00:56:28,416 --> 00:56:29,916
Why am I still being detained?

639
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,208
I believe

640
00:56:36,375 --> 00:56:40,083
you killed your wife with the T-800 serum

641
00:56:40,166 --> 00:56:42,958
and stole her body to avoid an autopsy.

642
00:56:43,041 --> 00:56:44,541
What's that suspicion based on?

643
00:56:44,625 --> 00:56:46,833
Your behavior over the last few hours.

644
00:56:48,125 --> 00:56:50,416
The bottle of the serum
found in your pocket.

645
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:51,500
That's not mine.

646
00:56:51,583 --> 00:56:53,416
Your company made it.

647
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:56,708
So I'm a suspect because
my company made it and I'm the director?

648
00:56:57,625 --> 00:57:00,750
The serum was produced by the largest
pharmaceutical factory

649
00:57:00,833 --> 00:57:02,458
with high-tech equipment,

650
00:57:02,541 --> 00:57:04,458
and it can cause a cardiac arrest.

651
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,458
You're not just the director,

652
00:57:06,541 --> 00:57:08,083
you're also a chemist.

653
00:57:08,166 --> 00:57:11,291
And your wife died of cardiac arrest.

654
00:57:11,916 --> 00:57:13,041
You take me for a fool?

655
00:57:13,125 --> 00:57:14,791
I didn't kill my wife!

656
00:57:16,208 --> 00:57:18,458
Even if I did kill her,

657
00:57:19,041 --> 00:57:21,458
I'd be an idiot to bring that here.

658
00:57:21,541 --> 00:57:25,333
Why would anyone kill
or poison someone with T-800

659
00:57:25,416 --> 00:57:28,583
and then steal the body
just to avoid an autopsy?

660
00:57:29,125 --> 00:57:31,333
T-800 dissolves in the blood.

661
00:57:31,416 --> 00:57:33,291
Impossible to detect in an autopsy.

662
00:57:35,291 --> 00:57:38,916
Interesting how well you know
about the serum now

663
00:57:40,916 --> 00:57:43,333
when you said
you knew nothing about it before.

664
00:57:43,416 --> 00:57:47,875
Well… I was panicking earlier.
You kept pressuring me.

665
00:57:50,625 --> 00:57:53,166
Rather than accusing me
with your nonsense,

666
00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:56,708
think about what I just said.
See if it makes sense.

667
00:57:56,791 --> 00:57:58,625
Make excuses all you want.

668
00:57:59,416 --> 00:58:04,333
I just need to prove that you
have a reason to steal that body.

669
00:58:04,416 --> 00:58:05,916
I didn't steal it!

670
00:58:07,583 --> 00:58:09,333
How many times do I have to say it?

671
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:13,041
You're supposed to locate my wife's body!

672
00:58:19,416 --> 00:58:20,458
Okay.

673
00:58:24,333 --> 00:58:25,833
Do you mind telling us…

674
00:58:27,416 --> 00:58:29,208
how you met your wife?

675
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:34,333
How's that relevant?

676
00:58:34,416 --> 00:58:35,541
I was just wondering.

677
00:58:36,916 --> 00:58:39,291
Since you two are so different.

678
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:42,625
- Different?
- Age gap.

679
00:58:42,708 --> 00:58:44,583
Social status, and more.

680
00:58:45,666 --> 00:58:46,625
Go on.

681
00:58:47,666 --> 00:58:49,083
Feel free to go into detail.

682
00:58:54,291 --> 00:58:56,083
We met in Bandung by chance.

683
00:58:56,166 --> 00:58:57,333
By chance?

684
00:58:57,416 --> 00:59:00,833
My motorcycle broke down, she passed by
in her car, offered me a ride.

685
00:59:01,375 --> 00:59:02,375
We talked,

686
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:05,666
grew closer, and fell in love.

687
00:59:06,333 --> 00:59:07,166
Pretty much it.

688
00:59:09,416 --> 00:59:13,541
Can coincidences like that really happen?

689
00:59:14,041 --> 00:59:15,833
Like something out of a soap opera.

690
00:59:24,166 --> 00:59:26,708
NATIONAL PHARMACY SEMINAR

691
00:59:28,125 --> 00:59:30,125
Please welcome our speaker,

692
00:59:30,208 --> 00:59:34,041
Ms. Sofia Arini, CEO of Hexa Medica.

693
00:59:38,833 --> 00:59:42,375
<i>We met in Bandung</i>
<i>at a pharmaceutical conference.</i>

694
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:46,250
<i>She was a speaker,</i>

695
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:48,375
<i>I was a participant.</i>

696
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:52,750
<i>Did you go there of your own accord?</i>

697
00:59:53,875 --> 00:59:55,958
<i>I was representing the campus</i>
<i>where I teach.</i>

698
00:59:58,250 --> 01:00:00,041
<i>I had just got my bachelor's degree</i>

699
01:00:00,750 --> 01:00:02,791
<i>and wanted to pursue a master's.</i>

700
01:00:03,416 --> 01:00:05,041
During that conference,

701
01:00:06,041 --> 01:00:07,541
you tried to get close to her?

702
01:00:10,666 --> 01:00:11,541
No.

703
01:00:13,166 --> 01:00:14,750
I just watched from a distance.

704
01:00:39,250 --> 01:00:41,041
Then how did you become close?

705
01:00:41,125 --> 01:00:42,833
One day I was visiting Pangalengan.

706
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:45,833
<i>My rental motorcycle broke down.</i>

707
01:00:48,125 --> 01:00:49,458
<i>There was no reception,</i>

708
01:00:49,541 --> 01:00:51,750
<i>I couldn't call the rental place</i>
<i>or a workshop.</i>

709
01:00:54,541 --> 01:00:56,041
<i>Then Sofia's car passed by.</i>

710
01:01:02,291 --> 01:01:03,291
Did you break down?

711
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:08,125
You were at the conference, right?

712
01:01:08,208 --> 01:01:10,208
<i>I was surprised she recognized me.</i>

713
01:01:10,291 --> 01:01:11,500
Yes.

714
01:01:11,583 --> 01:01:13,833
<i>Even though I didn't stand out at all.</i>

715
01:01:15,625 --> 01:01:19,000
<i>I'm an introvert,</i>
<i>but Sofia is very sociable.</i>

716
01:01:19,666 --> 01:01:21,958
<i>She can make conversations</i>
<i>feel comfortable.</i>

717
01:01:22,916 --> 01:01:26,041
<i>Back then, I was burnt out</i>
<i>from campus life,</i>

718
01:01:27,041 --> 01:01:29,083
<i>and Sofia was still grieving her parents.</i>

719
01:01:29,791 --> 01:01:32,958
<i>We grew close during the three days</i>
<i>of the conference.</i>

720
01:01:34,375 --> 01:01:36,166
What did she see in you?

721
01:01:36,250 --> 01:01:37,291
No idea.

722
01:01:37,375 --> 01:01:41,291
She said she needed young minds
to grow the company.

723
01:01:41,375 --> 01:01:42,666
I told her I was young

724
01:01:43,250 --> 01:01:44,958
and I specialized in pharmacy.

725
01:01:45,875 --> 01:01:48,666
We're working on a new product right now.

726
01:01:49,291 --> 01:01:50,583
And I think…

727
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:53,166
you can help me, Jef.

728
01:01:54,791 --> 01:01:55,666
Okay?

729
01:01:56,916 --> 01:01:58,000
If you trust me,

730
01:01:59,041 --> 01:02:00,125
I'm up for it.

731
01:02:04,291 --> 01:02:06,291
<i>At that time, were you aware</i>

732
01:02:06,375 --> 01:02:08,208
that she inherited one of the biggest

733
01:02:08,291 --> 01:02:10,458
pharmaceutical companies in the country?

734
01:02:10,541 --> 01:02:12,166
I knew once she told me.

735
01:02:12,250 --> 01:02:15,041
And that made you want to
marry her even more,

736
01:02:15,541 --> 01:02:18,791
despite her being 15 years older?

737
01:02:19,458 --> 01:02:20,875
We were in love.

738
01:02:22,166 --> 01:02:23,958
Love knows no age.

739
01:02:24,041 --> 01:02:25,166
Just like

740
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:27,750
a Shakespearean love story.

741
01:02:29,666 --> 01:02:31,083
How beautiful.

742
01:02:31,625 --> 01:02:33,666
Until death do us part.

743
01:02:34,416 --> 01:02:35,916
I was just lucky.

744
01:02:38,333 --> 01:02:41,333
Luck can happen by accident,

745
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:45,541
but some requires real effort.

746
01:02:49,958 --> 01:02:52,333
I love my wife.

747
01:02:52,416 --> 01:02:53,291
Really?

748
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:55,291
Can you tell me about

749
01:02:56,416 --> 01:02:59,333
the moment you reported your wife's death?

750
01:03:02,666 --> 01:03:03,916
I've submitted the report.

751
01:03:04,458 --> 01:03:05,791
I want to hear it from you.

752
01:03:05,875 --> 01:03:06,708
You can read it.

753
01:03:06,791 --> 01:03:08,750
I want to hear it straight from you.

754
01:03:22,875 --> 01:03:24,666
<i>After coming back from work,</i>

755
01:03:26,916 --> 01:03:29,208
<i>I saw my wife lying on the sofa.</i>

756
01:03:30,125 --> 01:03:31,333
Sof?

757
01:03:31,416 --> 01:03:32,416
<i>The music was on,</i>

758
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:34,375
<i>so I thought she was asleep.</i>

759
01:03:41,166 --> 01:03:42,541
<i>But when I checked,</i>

760
01:03:43,708 --> 01:03:45,000
<i>she was already gone.</i>

761
01:04:10,083 --> 01:04:11,041
Love?

762
01:04:12,166 --> 01:04:17,625
I don't sense any grief
in the way you're telling your story.

763
01:04:17,708 --> 01:04:19,583
Because you're making me upset.

764
01:04:20,625 --> 01:04:24,416
I explained everything to the officers
who came to my house!

765
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:25,958
But you keep asking about it!

766
01:04:26,916 --> 01:04:28,958
Reading a written story

767
01:04:29,750 --> 01:04:33,166
and hearing it in person are not the same.

768
01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:38,625
No wonder your wife grew suspicious.

769
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:40,291
What do you mean?

770
01:04:44,458 --> 01:04:46,750
She hired a private investigator.

771
01:04:51,541 --> 01:04:53,541
She suspected you were having an affair.

772
01:04:58,916 --> 01:05:02,666
This is a copy of your prenup.

773
01:05:04,333 --> 01:05:05,333
PRENUPTIAL AGREEMENT

774
01:05:05,416 --> 01:05:06,875
One clause states that

775
01:05:06,958 --> 01:05:08,333
if you have an affair,

776
01:05:10,625 --> 01:05:12,833
your wife will divorce you,

777
01:05:12,916 --> 01:05:16,666
and you won't get a penny from her assets,

778
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:17,875
including…

779
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,291
your contributions to the family business.

780
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,583
Isn't that what you were afraid of?

781
01:05:28,250 --> 01:05:30,333
That's why you considered

782
01:05:30,916 --> 01:05:34,916
killing your wife
once she caught you cheating?

783
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,416
Ridiculous.

784
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:37,625
That's ridiculous!

785
01:05:40,875 --> 01:05:42,291
We're about to prove it.

786
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:44,541
My team

787
01:05:46,375 --> 01:05:50,250
is on the way
to Dani Agustinus' place to verify.

788
01:05:52,875 --> 01:05:53,750
Who?

789
01:05:55,541 --> 01:05:56,916
Dani Agustinus.

790
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:03,125
The private investigator.

791
01:06:11,208 --> 01:06:12,041
He…

792
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,291
He's dead.

793
01:06:19,166 --> 01:06:21,333
Here, take a look.

794
01:06:22,250 --> 01:06:24,000
This is his body.

795
01:06:29,416 --> 01:06:30,500
Yunus Sasmita?

796
01:06:31,250 --> 01:06:32,083
This guy?

797
01:06:34,041 --> 01:06:35,416
YUNUS SASMITA, 50, MALE

798
01:06:37,875 --> 01:06:38,791
Wait.

799
01:06:38,958 --> 01:06:39,958
BURHANNUDIN, 35, MALE

800
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,416
DJUNAEDI KOZANO, 75, MALE

801
01:07:31,291 --> 01:07:33,000
- Yes, Julie?
<i>- Chief.</i>

802
01:07:33,083 --> 01:07:35,916
We're at the investigator's office,
but it's empty.

803
01:07:36,916 --> 01:07:39,208
Dani Agustinus is missing,

804
01:07:39,291 --> 01:07:42,000
and so are his investigation files.

805
01:07:43,166 --> 01:07:45,666
Looks like his computer's hard disk
is stolen.

806
01:07:45,750 --> 01:07:47,458
<i>There are traces of forced removal.</i>

807
01:07:47,541 --> 01:07:49,458
Search Sofia Arini's home as well.

808
01:07:49,541 --> 01:07:52,041
<i>She might have kept some reports.</i>

809
01:07:52,125 --> 01:07:53,833
<i>I'll arrange for a search warrant.</i>

810
01:07:53,916 --> 01:07:55,000
Yes, Chief.

811
01:07:57,208 --> 01:07:58,750
- Lio.
- Sir.

812
01:07:59,625 --> 01:08:00,875
Where's the custody van?

813
01:08:01,416 --> 01:08:02,833
One moment, let me check.

814
01:08:06,208 --> 01:08:07,458
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Sir.

815
01:08:07,541 --> 01:08:08,875
<i>Where's the custody van?</i>

816
01:08:09,416 --> 01:08:12,458
The road is jammed due to a fallen tree.

817
01:08:12,541 --> 01:08:13,791
<i>We're stuck here.</i>

818
01:08:46,541 --> 01:08:48,083
You two, over here!

819
01:08:48,166 --> 01:08:49,000
Yes, sir.

820
01:09:04,958 --> 01:09:06,333
<i>Hello, Sarah.</i>

821
01:09:06,416 --> 01:09:08,541
Dani Agustinus is a private investigator.

822
01:09:09,750 --> 01:09:11,583
Yeah, I know.

823
01:09:12,666 --> 01:09:14,791
How did you find out?

824
01:09:14,875 --> 01:09:16,125
When I got back home,

825
01:09:16,875 --> 01:09:18,666
there was an envelope under the door.

826
01:09:18,750 --> 01:09:19,750
From whom?

827
01:09:20,916 --> 01:09:21,875
The investigator?

828
01:09:21,958 --> 01:09:24,083
No sender's name, just a flash drive.

829
01:09:24,916 --> 01:09:27,833
I checked, and it had a folder
with the investigator's name.

830
01:09:27,916 --> 01:09:28,791
<i>What folder?</i>

831
01:09:31,416 --> 01:09:32,541
It's full of photos.

832
01:09:33,041 --> 01:09:34,166
I'll send them to you.

833
01:09:42,416 --> 01:09:44,166
They must have followed us.

834
01:09:44,250 --> 01:09:45,166
Not only that,

835
01:09:46,666 --> 01:09:49,375
I'm sending an audio file as well.
Listen to it.

836
01:09:50,583 --> 01:09:52,875
Oh, God. What now?

837
01:09:57,083 --> 01:09:59,125
<i>Don't worry, Sofia is scared of flying.</i>

838
01:09:59,208 --> 01:10:00,750
<i>If she suffers cardiac arrest,</i>

839
01:10:00,833 --> 01:10:03,625
<i>they will think it's due to the stress</i>
<i>of a long flight.</i>

840
01:10:08,416 --> 01:10:09,666
Sarah.

841
01:10:09,750 --> 01:10:11,666
<i>Sofia knew everything.</i>

842
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:14,458
<i>If she was able to send this</i>
<i>to your address,</i>

843
01:10:14,541 --> 01:10:18,208
it means she knows you and can hurt you!

844
01:10:18,291 --> 01:10:21,041
<i>You should leave now,</i>
<i>I'll catch up with you later.</i>

845
01:10:28,791 --> 01:10:30,958
Promise me you'll be there?

846
01:10:31,041 --> 01:10:32,958
<i>Yes, I promise.</i>

847
01:10:37,041 --> 01:10:37,875
Sarah?

848
01:10:39,250 --> 01:10:40,083
Sarah.

849
01:10:41,666 --> 01:10:43,166
Sarah, hello?

850
01:10:44,083 --> 01:10:45,458
I think I'm being followed.

851
01:10:46,750 --> 01:10:48,541
Jef. I'm scared.

852
01:10:48,625 --> 01:10:50,000
Where did you park your car?

853
01:10:50,083 --> 01:10:50,916
<i>Jefri.</i>

854
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,083
<i>Jefri!</i>

855
01:10:55,166 --> 01:10:56,000
Sarah.

856
01:10:57,250 --> 01:10:59,833
Sarah? Hello?

857
01:11:00,541 --> 01:11:01,375
Sarah!

858
01:11:03,291 --> 01:11:04,125
Fuck.

859
01:11:11,916 --> 01:11:13,333
Where are you going?

860
01:11:13,416 --> 01:11:14,375
I have to go.

861
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,708
I'm the one who gives orders here.

862
01:11:16,791 --> 01:11:18,500
Let me go!

863
01:11:20,291 --> 01:11:22,708
With all the evidence,
you'll be detained soon.

864
01:11:22,791 --> 01:11:24,583
I have to go, someone needs my help!

865
01:11:24,666 --> 01:11:25,541
Who?

866
01:11:30,875 --> 01:11:32,750
You all have no idea who I am.

867
01:11:34,166 --> 01:11:37,291
I can sue you all if you try to stop me!

868
01:11:37,375 --> 01:11:38,208
Hey.

869
01:11:38,291 --> 01:11:41,291
- Let me go! I must help Sarah!
- Calm down.

870
01:11:43,250 --> 01:11:44,500
Settle down!

871
01:12:00,208 --> 01:12:01,708
Please, help Sarah.

872
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:03,208
Are you two in cahoots?

873
01:12:04,791 --> 01:12:05,916
No, sir.

874
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:09,000
She's innocent,
she's not involved in this.

875
01:12:09,083 --> 01:12:09,958
I swear.

876
01:12:10,041 --> 01:12:11,250
Who is she to you?

877
01:12:11,875 --> 01:12:12,708
Here.

878
01:12:12,791 --> 01:12:14,125
Your so-called "sister"?

879
01:12:14,791 --> 01:12:16,250
I know she's not.

880
01:12:18,333 --> 01:12:19,541
Yes, she's not my sister.

881
01:12:20,041 --> 01:12:22,291
I lied, I'm sorry.

882
01:12:22,375 --> 01:12:25,458
Please help Sarah.
If you don't hurry, she could die.

883
01:12:25,541 --> 01:12:26,583
On one condition.

884
01:12:28,416 --> 01:12:30,333
Tell me everything.

885
01:12:30,416 --> 01:12:31,541
From the beginning.

886
01:12:33,125 --> 01:12:34,166
Check this address.

887
01:12:35,458 --> 01:12:36,291
Yes, sir.

888
01:12:41,416 --> 01:12:42,500
No lies this time.

889
01:12:49,041 --> 01:12:50,500
Her name is Sarah Arudita.

890
01:12:53,250 --> 01:12:55,166
We met eight months ago.

891
01:12:55,250 --> 01:12:57,541
<i>Despite being the director</i>
<i>of the company,</i>

892
01:12:57,625 --> 01:13:03,500
<i>I still make time</i>
<i>to teach one course at my alma mater.</i>

893
01:13:04,625 --> 01:13:06,875
Sorry for being late.

894
01:13:06,958 --> 01:13:08,625
<i>Sarah arrived late that day.</i>

895
01:13:09,250 --> 01:13:10,083
Come in.

896
01:13:16,958 --> 01:13:20,041
<i>Her face was innocent and intelligent,</i>

897
01:13:20,125 --> 01:13:21,833
<i>she captivated me.</i>

898
01:13:25,791 --> 01:13:27,708
I want you guys to find

899
01:13:27,791 --> 01:13:31,750
the endpoint of this chemical reaction.

900
01:13:37,125 --> 01:13:37,958
Excuse me, sir.

901
01:13:39,291 --> 01:13:40,125
Yeah?

902
01:13:41,625 --> 01:13:44,416
Did I miss a lot of the lesson?

903
01:13:46,416 --> 01:13:47,250
You did.

904
01:13:47,333 --> 01:13:50,708
<i>I said she missed</i>
<i>a lot of important things,</i>

905
01:13:50,791 --> 01:13:51,750
<i>which was a lie.</i>

906
01:13:52,166 --> 01:13:54,750
If you like, I can explain it again
at the library.

907
01:13:55,583 --> 01:13:57,791
<i>To get her to depend on me.</i>

908
01:13:58,666 --> 01:14:02,291
So, an example of an organic compound is

909
01:14:02,375 --> 01:14:04,291
aliphatic hydrocarbon

910
01:14:04,375 --> 01:14:09,458
like gasoline, paraffin, methane gas,
acetylene gas, and so on…

911
01:14:10,041 --> 01:14:11,958
<i>I offered her special tutoring sessions</i>

912
01:14:12,041 --> 01:14:16,500
<i>in the library after the class.</i>

913
01:14:17,750 --> 01:14:18,791
You're amazing, sir.

914
01:14:19,750 --> 01:14:20,583
Huh?

915
01:14:20,666 --> 01:14:21,541
I'm serious.

916
01:14:21,625 --> 01:14:26,208
You explain chemistry
as easily as breathing.

917
01:14:26,833 --> 01:14:27,791
So effortless.

918
01:14:29,041 --> 01:14:32,000
<i>I was always belittled at home.</i>

919
01:14:32,083 --> 01:14:33,791
But with Sarah,

920
01:14:36,375 --> 01:14:37,833
I felt like a hero.

921
01:14:38,375 --> 01:14:40,625
Always praised and admired.

922
01:14:41,291 --> 01:14:42,416
Respected.

923
01:14:43,250 --> 01:14:44,541
Yes, go ahead.

924
01:14:44,625 --> 01:14:48,208
<i>It started as a study session together,</i>

925
01:14:48,708 --> 01:14:52,541
<i>but over time, we were looking forward</i>
<i>to seeing each other every day.</i>

926
01:14:53,750 --> 01:14:57,041
<i>I was upfront with Sarah</i>
<i>about being married</i>

927
01:14:57,125 --> 01:15:01,041
<i>and she also told me she had a boyfriend.</i>

928
01:15:03,916 --> 01:15:05,250
<i>My wife grew suspicious.</i>

929
01:15:06,041 --> 01:15:10,416
<i>I tried to stop contacting</i>
<i>and seeing Sarah,</i>

930
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:11,750
<i>but it was hard.</i>

931
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,583
<i>I felt guilty,</i>

932
01:15:14,666 --> 01:15:20,333
<i>but Sarah gave me comfort</i>
<i>that Sofia didn't.</i>

933
01:15:23,291 --> 01:15:24,625
Eventually…

934
01:15:28,291 --> 01:15:30,375
the guilt faded away.

935
01:15:30,458 --> 01:15:32,708
Replaced by a sense of conviction

936
01:15:33,416 --> 01:15:37,416
that what I was doing with Sarah
wasn't wrong.

937
01:15:38,791 --> 01:15:40,458
I started to open up to Sarah.

938
01:15:41,416 --> 01:15:43,000
<i>I told her everything.</i>

939
01:15:43,750 --> 01:15:49,583
<i>Even my secrets that I never shared</i>
<i>with anyone else.</i>

940
01:15:49,666 --> 01:15:53,458
<i>Because we promised</i>
<i>to have no secrets or lies between us.</i>

941
01:15:56,625 --> 01:15:58,541
<i>I didn't want to betray my wife.</i>

942
01:15:59,291 --> 01:16:00,125
However,

943
01:16:01,750 --> 01:16:05,500
I had already fallen for Sarah.

944
01:16:07,541 --> 01:16:12,708
<i>Sarah broke up with her boyfriend</i>
<i>to be with me.</i>

945
01:16:13,416 --> 01:16:16,833
<i>But I was not ready to leave Sofia.</i>

946
01:16:18,250 --> 01:16:19,958
<i>Sarah had grown tired of waiting.</i>

947
01:16:21,250 --> 01:16:22,875
<i>She waited for a long time.</i>

948
01:16:24,208 --> 01:16:26,416
<i>She got mad and refused to see me.</i>

949
01:16:28,125 --> 01:16:28,958
Sarah!

950
01:16:30,791 --> 01:16:34,375
I don't understand.
You cried and got upset for what?

951
01:16:38,250 --> 01:16:40,125
<i>Sarah disappeared for a while.</i>

952
01:16:41,041 --> 01:16:43,208
<i>I tried reaching out</i>
<i>and searching for her.</i>

953
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,083
<i>I got nothing.</i>

954
01:16:57,333 --> 01:16:58,166
Sarah.

955
01:17:00,666 --> 01:17:02,833
I'm sorry.

956
01:17:02,916 --> 01:17:04,541
Hey.
I choose you.

957
01:17:07,833 --> 01:17:08,875
I choose you.

958
01:17:10,416 --> 01:17:14,000
<i>But ever since Sofia suspected something,</i>

959
01:17:14,083 --> 01:17:16,125
<i>she kept a close watch on me.</i>

960
01:17:18,250 --> 01:17:19,458
<i>Always.</i>

961
01:17:19,541 --> 01:17:24,166
<i>I knew it would end in divorce.</i>

962
01:17:24,250 --> 01:17:28,958
<i>And Sofia would destroy me,</i>
<i>my career, my life.</i>

963
01:17:29,041 --> 01:17:30,291
Is this Dani Agustinus?

964
01:17:35,250 --> 01:17:36,541
I need your help.

965
01:17:42,333 --> 01:17:43,708
I'm tired of this, Jef.

966
01:17:47,416 --> 01:17:48,375
Let's break up.

967
01:17:53,166 --> 01:17:54,166
Hey…

968
01:17:57,958 --> 01:17:59,041
I'm sorry.

969
01:18:02,041 --> 01:18:02,875
Sorry.

970
01:18:04,750 --> 01:18:05,750
Actually,

971
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:10,166
I've figured out a way to separate
from Sofia without a divorce.

972
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:14,250
And we would get everything.

973
01:18:55,625 --> 01:18:56,583
Thank you, darling.

974
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:00,666
Where's yours?

975
01:19:01,583 --> 01:19:03,458
It's too early for me.

976
01:19:03,541 --> 01:19:05,583
But I have one question.

977
01:19:05,666 --> 01:19:09,708
If you planned such a meticulous murder

978
01:19:09,791 --> 01:19:12,666
using the T-800 serum,

979
01:19:13,541 --> 01:19:16,375
why didn't she die
and instead disappeared?

980
01:19:17,416 --> 01:19:18,541
What went wrong?

981
01:19:25,541 --> 01:19:27,458
You saw her drink that wine.

982
01:19:28,375 --> 01:19:30,916
How did she escape death?

983
01:19:33,708 --> 01:19:34,791
See you.

984
01:19:40,916 --> 01:19:42,541
<i>Maybe she switched her glass?</i>

985
01:19:55,250 --> 01:19:57,000
<i>After that, then what?</i>

986
01:19:57,083 --> 01:19:59,666
Maybe she took neuroleptic drugs

987
01:20:00,666 --> 01:20:04,041
that could induce catalepsy.

988
01:20:04,125 --> 01:20:06,291
These drugs dissolve in the blood,

989
01:20:06,375 --> 01:20:07,958
slow down the respiratory system,

990
01:20:08,041 --> 01:20:11,041
and… stop the heart for a moment.

991
01:20:11,125 --> 01:20:15,208
After a while, the metabolism returns,

992
01:20:15,958 --> 01:20:18,708
her body could return to normal.
Like suspended animation.

993
01:20:18,791 --> 01:20:21,291
Wouldn't that be
too complex and dangerous?

994
01:20:21,375 --> 01:20:24,291
Not for Sofia.
She likes a challenge.

995
01:20:24,375 --> 01:20:26,041
She hates losing.

996
01:20:27,875 --> 01:20:30,666
I told you everything. Please help Sarah.

997
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:33,916
Hurry up and help her!

998
01:20:36,666 --> 01:20:37,500
Sir.

999
01:20:42,166 --> 01:20:44,166
Wait. We're not done here.

1000
01:20:44,750 --> 01:20:45,666
Sir!

1001
01:20:46,666 --> 01:20:48,083
- Help Sarah!
- Who is it?

1002
01:20:48,166 --> 01:20:49,583
Julie found something.

1003
01:20:49,666 --> 01:20:50,958
- Yes?
<i>- Sir.</i>

1004
01:20:51,041 --> 01:20:53,666
<i>We found the blueprint</i>
<i>of the forensic lab building</i>

1005
01:20:53,750 --> 01:20:56,166
<i>complete with alternative exit routes.</i>

1006
01:20:56,250 --> 01:21:00,000
There's also a manual for the building's
electrical system and cameras.

1007
01:21:00,541 --> 01:21:03,500
<i>This person knew the building inside out.</i>

1008
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,625
Any leads on the missing body?

1009
01:21:05,708 --> 01:21:06,708
<i>Not yet.</i>

1010
01:21:06,791 --> 01:21:09,708
<i>But we found a shovel</i>
<i>and shoes in the car trunk.</i>

1011
01:21:09,791 --> 01:21:12,833
<i>The size matches the footprints</i>
<i>behind the building.</i>

1012
01:21:12,916 --> 01:21:13,833
<i>Anything else?</i>

1013
01:21:14,375 --> 01:21:17,333
<i>We found black clothing</i>
<i>in the pile of dirty laundry.</i>

1014
01:21:17,416 --> 01:21:19,291
The outfit he used to sneak inside?

1015
01:21:20,166 --> 01:21:21,000
Ma'am.

1016
01:21:22,666 --> 01:21:24,000
Updates from the hospital?

1017
01:21:24,083 --> 01:21:25,166
Yes, Ma'am.

1018
01:21:25,250 --> 01:21:26,416
<i>Report to the chief.</i>

1019
01:21:28,083 --> 01:21:29,000
Sir.

1020
01:21:29,583 --> 01:21:30,583
The guard is awake

1021
01:21:30,666 --> 01:21:32,583
<i>and he told me what happened.</i>

1022
01:21:32,666 --> 01:21:34,250
- Tell me.
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

1023
01:22:15,250 --> 01:22:16,166
Sir.

1024
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:17,791
Help me!

1025
01:22:45,166 --> 01:22:46,000
Okay.

1026
01:23:03,916 --> 01:23:05,541
We found some clothes,

1027
01:23:06,125 --> 01:23:07,916
a mask, and black gloves.

1028
01:23:08,458 --> 01:23:11,708
They match
the security guard's description.

1029
01:23:13,875 --> 01:23:16,125
We also found a pair of shoes

1030
01:23:16,833 --> 01:23:19,875
that leaves footprints just like the ones
behind this building.

1031
01:23:19,958 --> 01:23:24,166
And tools capable of dismantling
iron bars.

1032
01:23:26,708 --> 01:23:29,750
Can you guess where we found them?

1033
01:23:35,458 --> 01:23:36,500
At your house!

1034
01:23:38,333 --> 01:23:40,291
Along with the building blueprint

1035
01:23:41,375 --> 01:23:43,708
and the electrical system manual.

1036
01:23:43,791 --> 01:23:46,000
I've never had the items you mentioned.

1037
01:23:46,583 --> 01:23:47,583
They must be Sofia's.

1038
01:23:47,666 --> 01:23:48,875
She's dead!

1039
01:23:48,958 --> 01:23:50,208
You killed her.

1040
01:23:50,291 --> 01:23:51,833
You can't even prove it.

1041
01:23:51,916 --> 01:23:53,833
Her body is still missing right now.

1042
01:23:53,916 --> 01:23:55,208
Because you hid it.

1043
01:23:55,291 --> 01:23:56,750
Because she's still alive!

1044
01:23:58,041 --> 01:23:59,541
Wait!

1045
01:23:59,625 --> 01:24:02,250
Wait. Let me explain.

1046
01:24:02,791 --> 01:24:05,708
The most plausible explanation
why Sofia is behind all this.

1047
01:24:11,125 --> 01:24:12,375
She's not alone.

1048
01:24:12,916 --> 01:24:14,416
<i>Someone helped her.</i>

1049
01:24:15,541 --> 01:24:18,000
<i>She faked her death.</i>

1050
01:24:20,666 --> 01:24:22,166
After that,

1051
01:24:23,541 --> 01:24:25,750
<i>she planned to come back</i>
<i>at the right moment.</i>

1052
01:24:28,916 --> 01:24:31,666
You stole the body.
You created confusion

1053
01:24:31,750 --> 01:24:35,041
<i>as if she came back to life,</i>

1054
01:24:35,125 --> 01:24:37,208
<i>distracting the security guard that night.</i>

1055
01:24:37,750 --> 01:24:39,750
You should check the private investigator.

1056
01:24:40,625 --> 01:24:42,083
Dani Agustinus.

1057
01:24:42,666 --> 01:24:44,458
Sofia must've paid him

1058
01:24:44,541 --> 01:24:47,041
<i>to help her pull off this madness.</i>

1059
01:24:59,083 --> 01:25:00,333
Her plan is flawless.

1060
01:25:01,708 --> 01:25:03,583
Making me the scapegoat.

1061
01:25:07,625 --> 01:25:08,541
Sarah.

1062
01:25:09,125 --> 01:25:10,416
Find Sarah,

1063
01:25:11,041 --> 01:25:13,875
she'll vouch for me.

1064
01:25:14,833 --> 01:25:15,875
Please find her.

1065
01:25:16,833 --> 01:25:17,958
Please.

1066
01:25:56,125 --> 01:25:57,333
Yes, Julie.

1067
01:25:57,416 --> 01:25:58,333
<i>Chief.</i>

1068
01:25:58,416 --> 01:26:00,041
Did you find the apartment?

1069
01:26:00,541 --> 01:26:02,208
There's no one here, Chief.

1070
01:26:02,750 --> 01:26:04,250
<i>Any signs of violence?</i>

1071
01:26:04,958 --> 01:26:06,500
<i>He said she was threatened.</i>

1072
01:26:07,458 --> 01:26:08,375
Nothing.

1073
01:26:09,791 --> 01:26:11,208
<i>She ran away?</i>

1074
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:14,750
More than that.

1075
01:26:15,416 --> 01:26:18,708
It looks like this place has been vacant
for some time.

1076
01:26:19,541 --> 01:26:20,375
Okay.

1077
01:26:31,541 --> 01:26:34,208
<i>Call the entire forensics team.</i>

1078
01:26:34,291 --> 01:26:38,000
Yes. Secure every road
in a one-kilometer radius.

1079
01:26:47,583 --> 01:26:48,583
Chief.

1080
01:26:48,666 --> 01:26:52,250
K9 scoured the forest all night,

1081
01:26:52,333 --> 01:26:54,583
and we've located the body
deep in the forest.

1082
01:27:41,208 --> 01:27:44,375
The address you gave us,
Sarah Arudita's place?

1083
01:27:44,458 --> 01:27:46,458
It's unoccupied.

1084
01:27:46,541 --> 01:27:48,291
It's an empty apartment.

1085
01:27:48,375 --> 01:27:51,833
No one in the neighborhood
recognizes the name Sarah Arudita.

1086
01:27:52,541 --> 01:27:56,041
We also checked the hospital
where you said she interned,

1087
01:27:57,666 --> 01:27:59,625
but there's no record of her.

1088
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:04,500
Now I'm starting to think
you're making up stories.

1089
01:28:04,583 --> 01:28:07,583
You created a fictional character

1090
01:28:08,500 --> 01:28:10,750
named Sarah Arudita in your head

1091
01:28:10,833 --> 01:28:15,125
to give yourself the courage
and motivation to kill your wife.

1092
01:28:21,250 --> 01:28:22,750
Take the body back.

1093
01:28:24,750 --> 01:28:25,583
Lio.

1094
01:28:27,041 --> 01:28:28,083
Remove the barricade.

1095
01:28:29,041 --> 01:28:29,875
Yes, sir.

1096
01:28:29,958 --> 01:28:32,375
We've created an unnecessary traffic jam.

1097
01:28:33,250 --> 01:28:35,250
Julie. Make a report.

1098
01:28:35,333 --> 01:28:37,000
The investigation is over.

1099
01:28:37,875 --> 01:28:40,666
We have enough evidence
to charge with multiple counts.

1100
01:28:42,166 --> 01:28:43,041
Yes, Chief.

1101
01:28:45,750 --> 01:28:46,666
Get up.

1102
01:28:47,541 --> 01:28:49,458
Wait, wait.

1103
01:28:54,250 --> 01:28:55,625
That bastard!

1104
01:29:57,791 --> 01:29:59,250
Where are you going?

1105
01:30:01,791 --> 01:30:05,625
Now I see how hard it is to pretend.

1106
01:30:07,791 --> 01:30:09,708
What's wrong with my body?

1107
01:30:10,541 --> 01:30:13,875
Why do I feel paralyzed?

1108
01:30:17,708 --> 01:30:21,500
We've been stuck in that forensic building
for almost eight hours.

1109
01:30:23,291 --> 01:30:24,583
You must be exhausted.

1110
01:30:24,666 --> 01:30:26,333
Please help me.

1111
01:30:26,833 --> 01:30:29,375
Take me to a hospital.

1112
01:30:29,916 --> 01:30:31,541
Help.

1113
01:30:36,291 --> 01:30:38,833
Would you take someone in pain
to a hospital

1114
01:30:40,750 --> 01:30:43,458
if the someone wasn't yourself?

1115
01:30:49,375 --> 01:30:52,583
I can't help but think of my late wife.

1116
01:30:58,125 --> 01:31:00,333
She passed away ten years ago.

1117
01:31:06,916 --> 01:31:07,833
Are you tired?

1118
01:31:10,166 --> 01:31:11,208
Close your eyes.

1119
01:31:13,291 --> 01:31:14,875
Thank you for the ride.

1120
01:31:20,291 --> 01:31:21,333
Enough.

1121
01:31:25,041 --> 01:31:26,750
- It's green.
- Yeah.

1122
01:31:42,250 --> 01:31:45,500
The official records say
she died in an accident.

1123
01:31:46,750 --> 01:31:48,125
But truth is,

1124
01:31:49,875 --> 01:31:51,250
she was murdered.

1125
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,250
<i>My daughter was also in that car.</i>

1126
01:31:58,250 --> 01:31:59,166
Lidya!

1127
01:31:59,916 --> 01:32:01,958
Are you okay, Sweetie?

1128
01:32:02,041 --> 01:32:03,875
Dad.

1129
01:32:04,541 --> 01:32:06,125
It hurts.

1130
01:32:06,208 --> 01:32:07,375
Mira, wake up.

1131
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:09,125
Mira.

1132
01:32:09,208 --> 01:32:10,458
<i>Taking her to the hospital</i>

1133
01:32:10,541 --> 01:32:15,541
or providing first aid
could have saved my wife.

1134
01:32:18,375 --> 01:32:20,958
But the car that hit us…

1135
01:32:24,041 --> 01:32:29,041
just drove away,
as if nothing happened.

1136
01:32:29,666 --> 01:32:30,791
<i>Help!</i>

1137
01:32:30,875 --> 01:32:31,708
<i>Help!</i>

1138
01:32:34,666 --> 01:32:35,500
Help!

1139
01:32:38,250 --> 01:32:39,166
Mira!

1140
01:32:41,791 --> 01:32:42,875
Help!

1141
01:32:46,208 --> 01:32:47,041
Help!

1142
01:32:49,875 --> 01:32:51,750
An hour passed

1143
01:32:53,333 --> 01:32:55,291
before help arrived.

1144
01:32:59,666 --> 01:33:00,541
Mira.

1145
01:33:11,625 --> 01:33:12,500
Mira!

1146
01:33:25,375 --> 01:33:28,000
My wife died in my arms.

1147
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,583
I tried to remember
the car's license plate.

1148
01:33:36,666 --> 01:33:38,708
But nothing came up.

1149
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:42,333
But one day my daughter remembered.

1150
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:50,958
You're okay.

1151
01:33:51,625 --> 01:33:53,083
Take a break, Sweetie.

1152
01:33:53,166 --> 01:33:54,583
I'm okay, Dad.

1153
01:33:55,958 --> 01:33:56,791
You sure?

1154
01:33:58,541 --> 01:34:00,500
<i>There was another clue.</i>

1155
01:34:01,541 --> 01:34:03,166
<i>A ten year old's drawing,</i>

1156
01:34:04,125 --> 01:34:05,750
<i>even though it wasn't precise.</i>

1157
01:34:08,541 --> 01:34:11,500
<i>But the logo was familiar.</i>

1158
01:34:12,583 --> 01:34:15,541
I had plenty of time to investigate.

1159
01:34:16,666 --> 01:34:19,250
I contacted all my friends
in the police force,

1160
01:34:19,875 --> 01:34:23,500
<i>collected every bit of information.</i>

1161
01:34:24,708 --> 01:34:25,541
<i>And in the end,</i>

1162
01:34:26,166 --> 01:34:28,541
<i>I found you.</i>

1163
01:34:31,541 --> 01:34:33,791
- Jef!
- They have a kid, Sof.

1164
01:34:33,875 --> 01:34:35,416
- Jefri!
- Sof!

1165
01:34:35,500 --> 01:34:36,375
Go.

1166
01:34:48,500 --> 01:34:52,458
How can you live all these years

1167
01:34:52,541 --> 01:34:54,708
carrying the weight of such a crime?

1168
01:34:57,833 --> 01:34:58,666
Okay.

1169
01:35:01,333 --> 01:35:03,833
Let me make you understand.

1170
01:35:07,708 --> 01:35:09,375
This is my daughter.

1171
01:35:10,250 --> 01:35:11,208
Her name is Lidya.

1172
01:35:27,416 --> 01:35:29,208
- Hello?
- Good evening.

1173
01:35:30,500 --> 01:35:32,875
I'm Arya Pradana, from the police.

1174
01:36:10,041 --> 01:36:11,666
Sir! Send help!

1175
01:36:48,541 --> 01:36:51,208
<i>We found a shovel</i>
<i>and shoes in the car trunk.</i>

1176
01:36:51,291 --> 01:36:53,833
<i>The size matches the footprints</i>
<i>behind the building.</i>

1177
01:36:55,291 --> 01:36:57,875
Dad. I've left the phone
at the restaurant.

1178
01:37:02,416 --> 01:37:05,833
She approached you at the campus
without me knowing.

1179
01:37:08,750 --> 01:37:12,958
To make sure she didn't get
the wrong person.

1180
01:37:20,166 --> 01:37:21,958
Promise me you'll be there?

1181
01:37:22,041 --> 01:37:23,791
<i>Yes, I promise.</i>

1182
01:37:25,666 --> 01:37:29,208
<i>Please be careful. Okay?</i>

1183
01:37:29,291 --> 01:37:30,208
Jefri!

1184
01:37:31,625 --> 01:37:32,500
<i>But no.</i>

1185
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:34,291
<i>For herself,</i>

1186
01:37:34,375 --> 01:37:37,041
<i>she had to make you willingly confess</i>

1187
01:37:37,583 --> 01:37:40,750
the worst things you ever did.

1188
01:37:44,541 --> 01:37:45,958
And she did it.

1189
01:37:47,250 --> 01:37:49,833
She made you confess everything,

1190
01:37:49,916 --> 01:37:54,166
all in the name of love.

1191
01:37:58,666 --> 01:38:00,541
There were three people in that car.

1192
01:38:03,166 --> 01:38:06,666
A man, a woman and…

1193
01:38:07,791 --> 01:38:09,000
A little girl.

1194
01:38:10,916 --> 01:38:13,375
I didn't know what to do.

1195
01:38:14,291 --> 01:38:17,458
<i>I wanted to help them back then,</i>

1196
01:38:18,166 --> 01:38:22,000
<i>but Sofia asked me to flee the scene.</i>

1197
01:38:23,750 --> 01:38:25,791
Sarah, what's wrong with you?

1198
01:38:26,250 --> 01:38:27,333
He confessed, Dad.

1199
01:38:28,125 --> 01:38:29,250
He's the culprit.

1200
01:38:34,708 --> 01:38:35,916
We'll finish it, dear.

1201
01:38:38,541 --> 01:38:39,750
We'll finish it.

1202
01:38:40,875 --> 01:38:46,000
That confession was all we needed
to hunt you down.

1203
01:38:53,875 --> 01:38:59,291
<i>The T-800 serum is formulated</i>
<i>from various reptilian venoms.</i>

1204
01:38:59,375 --> 01:39:03,500
<i>It dissolves in blood,</i>
<i>stops the heart within eight hours,</i>

1205
01:39:03,583 --> 01:39:05,458
<i>and leaves no trace.</i>

1206
01:39:08,166 --> 01:39:11,541
<i>This serum also induces hallucinations.</i>

1207
01:39:17,416 --> 01:39:20,833
<i>Panic and fear will take over,</i>
<i>before eventually death.</i>

1208
01:39:24,083 --> 01:39:25,666
Dad, I'm at the airport.

1209
01:39:27,041 --> 01:39:29,583
No one knows I'm here,
no one's following me.

1210
01:39:29,666 --> 01:39:31,458
I've emptied out the apartment.

1211
01:39:32,541 --> 01:39:33,875
I'm going back to Malaysia.

1212
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:40,916
Look.

1213
01:39:42,166 --> 01:39:43,083
Take a look.

1214
01:39:43,416 --> 01:39:48,458
You'll soon be with your wife again.

1215
01:39:56,500 --> 01:39:57,750
You bastard.

1216
01:39:59,791 --> 01:40:01,333
So smug.

1217
01:40:03,708 --> 01:40:05,166
Arrogant.

1218
01:40:11,541 --> 01:40:16,125
Your tears mean nothing.

1219
01:40:23,083 --> 01:40:24,041
Three.

1220
01:40:28,791 --> 01:40:29,708
Two.

1221
01:40:32,416 --> 01:40:33,541
One.
