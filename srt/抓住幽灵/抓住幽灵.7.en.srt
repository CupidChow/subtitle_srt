00:00:16,021 --> 00:00:17,580
(_All characters, organizations,
places, entities, and events...)

2
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,091
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:19,091 --> 00:00:21,396
- The avocado case.
- Avocado?

4
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:24,091
She used to post videos of herself
partying at clubs in Hongdae.

5
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:25,190
I look stupid.

6
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:26,830
This was two weeks ago already.

7
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:29,560
She has been missing ever
since this video was uploaded.

8
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,031
(Previously on Catch the Ghost)

9
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,375
Did she go missing?

10
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,445
I saw a weird one.

11
00:00:34,571 --> 00:00:36,071
He had a weapon,

12
00:00:36,071 --> 00:00:38,216
and took the victim's
wallet and not jewelry.

13
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,686
Maybe that petty thief had something
to do with Avocado's disappearance.

14
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,756
He only robs people on the
first train after Club Day?

15
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:46,710
He pickpockets women on the first train...

16
00:00:46,711 --> 00:00:48,110
from Hongik University Station,

17
00:00:48,111 --> 00:00:49,856
then goes to the woman's house.

18
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,225
He only stole my wallet.

19
00:00:52,351 --> 00:00:54,295
There was nothing else.

20
00:00:54,891 --> 00:00:57,665
How did you know Avocado was
a victim of sexual assault?

21
00:00:57,821 --> 00:01:00,905
After we talked,
I noticed the signs of a rape victim.

22
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,436
She'd flinch if a strange man passed by.

23
00:01:03,761 --> 00:01:05,261
It would've been difficult
to live in the house...

24
00:01:05,261 --> 00:01:06,430
where the crime was committed.

25
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:08,270
Since they partially blamed
themselves to be guilty,

26
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:09,799
it would've been hard to tell others.

27
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,901
If you party all night in Hongdae...

28
00:01:10,901 --> 00:01:12,446
and take the first train, you disappear.

29
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,240
The rumor already had all the answers.

30
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,680
The hardest part of a rape case...

31
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,086
is getting the victim's statement!

32
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:20,925
Metro Detective Division will lead the case.

33
00:01:21,251 --> 00:01:23,556
Work with Subway Police to
solve this case right away!

34
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,996
Let's switch partners.

35
00:01:29,591 --> 00:01:31,095
(Episode 7)

36
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:36,026
We're a joint investigation team now.

37
00:01:37,481 --> 00:01:40,625
If we want to share the
information each team investigated,

38
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,726
I think it would make
sense to switch partners.

39
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,536
Officer Yoo, you should be my partner.

40
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:52,235
- Me?
- Hey.

41
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,476
- I'd like that.
- Woo Hyuk, watch it.

42
00:01:59,371 --> 00:02:02,586
You're so rational. And easy going.

43
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,786
Fine, let's switch.

44
00:02:07,811 --> 00:02:10,656
She seems to be a busybody.

45
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:13,855
Try to control her.

46
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:16,996
Let's go to Park Yoo Mi. You go to Avocado.

47
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:18,365
Yes, ma'am.

48
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,145
You look so cool. I'll drive.

49
00:02:31,771 --> 00:02:34,575
No. I prefer driving.

50
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,585
You'll probably be uncomfortable
having me hold you from behind.

51
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,186
You don't like me.

52
00:02:44,151 --> 00:02:46,795
Then... You drive.

53
00:02:57,091 --> 00:02:59,636
What? She's letting him drive?

54
00:03:00,331 --> 00:03:01,605
Get in.

55
00:03:01,861 --> 00:03:03,006
Okay.

56
00:03:10,371 --> 00:03:12,380
What's the benefit of riding a scooter?

57
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,480
Let's weave through the cars.

58
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,010
We'll get there tomorrow at this rate.

59
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:17,311
We're not in a rush.

60
00:03:17,311 --> 00:03:18,756
Police officers should abide by the law.

61
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,626
We're not in a rush?

62
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,521
Avocado is a rape victim.

63
00:03:22,521 --> 00:03:24,720
I'm worried about how she feels
and scared that she may think...

64
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,436
about doing something drastic.

65
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:29,660
Plus, we need to persuade her
quickly and catch the scumbag.

66
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,290
He may flee.

67
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:32,536
Fine.

68
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,205
Here we go. Hold on tight.

69
00:03:35,901 --> 00:03:39,075
Okay! Speed up! Go!

70
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:44,416
Why is he driving like that?

71
00:03:45,341 --> 00:03:47,485
He's being controlled.

72
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,386
What?

73
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,925
When do you think my mom
will ever approve of me?

74
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,265
No.

75
00:04:00,091 --> 00:04:01,921
How long must I work...

76
00:04:01,921 --> 00:04:04,566
to gain my mom's approval?

77
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:07,036
It's because she cherishes you,

78
00:04:07,401 --> 00:04:08,775
and you have ambition.

79
00:04:12,331 --> 00:04:14,746
You were the first person
I received approval from.

80
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:17,145
That's not true.

81
00:04:17,911 --> 00:04:19,311
You just accepted me...

82
00:04:19,311 --> 00:04:22,285
without even thinking about approving of me.

83
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,395
(Mom)

84
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:35,265
Hey, it's me. What's up?

85
00:04:36,931 --> 00:04:38,366
Yes, that's right.

86
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:41,676
Yes, it's me, Myung Chul.

87
00:04:44,171 --> 00:04:46,676
I'm very busy right now. I'll call you back.

88
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,046
Okay. Bye now.

89
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:52,241
- What was that?
- What?

90
00:04:52,241 --> 00:04:54,316
- Just now.
- Hold on.

91
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,585
The GPS... I was using my phone.

92
00:04:58,351 --> 00:05:00,520
I missed the turn because
I couldn't see the GPS.

93
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,825
Darn it.

94
00:05:02,351 --> 00:05:04,126
We're going the wrong way.

95
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:09,606
Myung Chul's always busy.

96
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,750
Myung Chul!

97
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:36,225
Ae Shim!

98
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,525
Gosh.

99
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,376
You have a son, right?

100
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:53,645
What?

101
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,116
Of all the crazy things...

102
00:05:57,411 --> 00:05:59,856
How could I have a son?

103
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,486
I'm so young.

104
00:06:02,551 --> 00:06:04,556
Excuse me. Just a minute.

105
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,020
She has dementia,

106
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,796
so she doesn't remember her son.

107
00:06:12,921 --> 00:06:16,561
What? Even if she has dementia,

108
00:06:16,561 --> 00:06:18,306
how could she not remember her son?

109
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:19,936
It breaks my heart too.

110
00:06:20,161 --> 00:06:22,376
Her son is such a good son.

111
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,075
He visits her every other day.

112
00:06:25,031 --> 00:06:27,515
He's a detective.

113
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:32,785
- A detective?
- Yes.

114
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,116
What now?

115
00:07:04,811 --> 00:07:07,015
I don't need to find my wallet.

116
00:07:08,681 --> 00:07:10,856
We know what happened to you.

117
00:07:11,781 --> 00:07:13,650
You're not the only victim.

118
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:16,225
That jerk is a serial rapist.

119
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:17,926
What?

120
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:20,491
If you want to rest...

121
00:07:20,491 --> 00:07:23,736
Yoo Mi. You must be strong.
We have to catch the perp.

122
00:07:24,061 --> 00:07:26,275
We can't identify him right now.

123
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,330
What you remember may provide a big lead.

124
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:31,306
I don't remember anything,
and I don't want to remember.

125
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:33,645
Yoo Mi! Hold on. Yoo Mi!

126
00:07:41,111 --> 00:07:44,056
She seemed very anxious.
Is it okay to just leave?

127
00:07:44,981 --> 00:07:47,450
Just as you bruise from physical trauma,

128
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:49,866
your brain gets damaged
from psychological trauma.

129
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,690
You get nervous, depressed,

130
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:53,165
and have negative thoughts.

131
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,996
You can't even think
about solving the problem.

132
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:59,106
But the degree varies by person.

133
00:07:59,431 --> 00:08:01,236
Some are strong and overcome it,

134
00:08:01,561 --> 00:08:03,246
so let's go see another victim.

135
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,845
It'll take too long to persuade Park Yoo Mi.

136
00:08:09,301 --> 00:08:11,070
Taking time isn't the problem.

137
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,415
Her life is at...

138
00:08:20,481 --> 00:08:22,725
What if Choi Do Chul is
in danger right now??

139
00:08:29,531 --> 00:08:30,665
Mister.

140
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,775
How could we ignore it
when we have a victim?

141
00:08:37,301 --> 00:08:38,476
Let's just do it.

142
00:08:42,171 --> 00:08:44,315
- Ji Seok.
- Yes?

143
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,216
Give me the contact information
of the other victim.

144
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,685
Okay.

145
00:08:53,281 --> 00:08:54,356
Ye Na.

146
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,996
We came to tell you something.

147
00:09:00,561 --> 00:09:03,035
We came because we want to help you.

148
00:09:24,751 --> 00:09:27,925
If you tell us everything
that happened that day,

149
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,326
we promise to catch him.

150
00:09:31,751 --> 00:09:33,620
I said nothing happened.

151
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,765
He was caught in your video.

152
00:09:39,531 --> 00:09:41,636
That was...

153
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:45,730
I was just...
I didn't lock my door that day,

154
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,815
so I think someone came in by mistake.

155
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,886
I drank a lot that night...

156
00:09:51,011 --> 00:09:53,541
so I can't remember very well.

157
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:55,356
It isn't your fault.

158
00:09:58,881 --> 00:10:00,655
Cry if you want to.

159
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:06,496
The helplessness, fear,
and rage that you felt that day...

160
00:10:08,421 --> 00:10:11,236
Don't replay it over and
over and torture yourself.

161
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:13,236
Ye Na.

162
00:10:14,631 --> 00:10:16,606
Catch that jerk with me.

163
00:10:17,401 --> 00:10:21,445
We need to catch him in order to heal you.

164
00:10:24,811 --> 00:10:27,011
Why must you hide?

165
00:10:27,011 --> 00:10:30,126
That jerk who did this to
you is out there living well.

166
00:10:31,651 --> 00:10:33,726
You blame me too, don't you?

167
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,226
You can't catch him because I won't talk,

168
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:40,320
so you're being persistent to
get your arrest numbers up.

169
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,336
That's not true. We...

170
00:10:43,031 --> 00:10:44,236
Get out.

171
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,435
Get out now!

172
00:10:49,131 --> 00:10:51,431
Go. Get out!

173
00:10:51,431 --> 00:10:52,840
- Ye Na.
- Get out.

174
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,240
- Ye Na.
- Get out!

175
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,675
Get out!

176
00:11:25,031 --> 00:11:26,271
(Should I report a rape?)

177
00:11:26,271 --> 00:11:28,771
My family found out because I reported it.

178
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:32,240
Seeing my parents hurting
was the hardest part.

179
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,915
I should've just dealt with it on my own.

180
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:38,551
I reported it and kept having
to go in for questioning,

181
00:11:38,551 --> 00:11:41,155
so everyone I knew found out.

182
00:11:55,061 --> 00:11:56,175
(Rooms for Rent)

183
00:11:58,431 --> 00:12:00,271
Are you really going to stay here all night?

184
00:12:00,271 --> 00:12:02,015
You go first.

185
00:12:02,141 --> 00:12:04,545
I can't leave my partner behind.

186
00:12:10,651 --> 00:12:13,525
What you said to Avocado earlier...

187
00:12:14,051 --> 00:12:16,866
Fear, helplessness, rage...

188
00:12:17,921 --> 00:12:19,295
That's about you, isn't it?

189
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:26,636
Looks like Ye Na can't sleep.

190
00:12:27,401 --> 00:12:29,501
It's late. You should go.

191
00:12:29,501 --> 00:12:32,106
I'll leave once she turns off the light.

192
00:12:32,401 --> 00:12:35,545
I'll leave once I see you leave.

193
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:55,265
Why won't they cooperate
and help us catch the perp?

194
00:12:55,921 --> 00:12:58,706
We can't do anything without
the victims' testimonies.

195
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:02,860
Do you still sleep only a few
hours at a time on the couch?

196
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,730
It's more tiring going all the way home.

197
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:07,216
I'll drive you. You should rest tonight.

198
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:14,010
Wasn't that your mother
on the phone earlier?

199
00:13:14,011 --> 00:13:15,315
What?

200
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:17,685
No.

201
00:13:21,381 --> 00:13:24,366
I have some files to go over.
See you tomorrow.

202
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,636
Okay, then. Don't work too hard.

203
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:38,376
Hey, Woo Hyuk.

204
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:41,346
What?

205
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,415
You're going to stay with her all night?

206
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,940
All night? Together?

207
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,511
Okay. See you tomorrow.

208
00:13:48,511 --> 00:13:49,616
Why?

209
00:13:50,881 --> 00:13:52,055
Where?

210
00:13:53,051 --> 00:13:54,420
Darn it.

(Rooms for Rent)

212
00:14:33,061 --> 00:14:36,119
She should report to her superior
if she's staying up all night,

213
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,035
or going home.

214
00:14:48,141 --> 00:14:50,515
Newbie, where are you?

215
00:14:50,771 --> 00:14:52,685
Report in regarding the investigation.

216
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,541
(Newbie, where are you?
Report in regarding the investigation.)

217
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:55,685
3am.

218
00:14:56,881 --> 00:14:58,685
I can't tell her to report in at this hour.

219
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,126
Whatever.

220
00:15:16,131 --> 00:15:18,746
Is he drunk? Should we call the cops?

221
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:27,356
I fell asleep.

222
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:32,726
How could Ryung just leave me?

223
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,525
She's colder than she looks.

224
00:15:35,021 --> 00:15:37,165
You're denser than you look.

225
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,165
How could you sleep so
well on those hard steps?

226
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:46,706
I always sleep well when I'm
with a woman that I like.

227
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:50,305
What's that? Our breakfast?

228
00:15:51,901 --> 00:15:54,915
I'm going to see Ye Na for a minute.

229
00:16:09,021 --> 00:16:10,265
Here.

230
00:16:15,021 --> 00:16:18,206
I thought it would help you.

231
00:16:28,501 --> 00:16:29,876
I'm back.

232
00:16:30,911 --> 00:16:32,086
Hi.

233
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,185
I heard you got a new partner as you wanted.

234
00:16:40,421 --> 00:16:42,781
Yes, I did.

235
00:16:42,781 --> 00:16:44,395
What about Avocado?

236
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,496
Did staying up all night pay off?

237
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:49,590
Not yet.

238
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,866
Newbie.

239
00:16:51,031 --> 00:16:54,636
Did you forget you were on
probation until this case is closed?

240
00:16:55,131 --> 00:16:57,275
Nothing has changed yet.

241
00:16:57,531 --> 00:16:59,401
Don't get some delusion of
grandeur about your position,

242
00:16:59,401 --> 00:17:01,716
and report in regularly
regarding the schedule...

243
00:17:02,216 --> 00:17:03,932
and status of the investigation.

244
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:07,116
- Yes, sir. I'm sorry...
- I'm going to Metro.

245
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:11,856
Bye.

246
00:17:12,051 --> 00:17:13,425
Bye.

(Rooms for Rent)

248
00:17:47,216 --> 00:17:49,460
You had your light on all night.

249
00:17:49,925 --> 00:17:53,831
They say you get more anxious
and depressed if you don't sleep.

250
00:17:54,195 --> 00:17:57,101
Why don't you try to sleep with a candle on?

251
00:17:57,695 --> 00:18:01,311
Candles helped me.

252
00:18:02,095 --> 00:18:03,240
Yoo Ryung.

253
00:18:20,955 --> 00:18:22,061
I'm sorry.

254
00:18:30,895 --> 00:18:33,141
- There's been an update!
- What do you mean?

255
00:18:33,496 --> 00:18:34,796
Avocado's vlog.

256
00:18:34,796 --> 00:18:36,365
A new video has been posted.

(Investigation Team 1)

258
00:18:38,105 --> 00:18:39,210
Really?

(Avocado's Shocking Confession)

260
00:18:42,776 --> 00:18:45,520
(Avocado TV)

261
00:18:47,816 --> 00:18:48,920
I...

262
00:18:49,885 --> 00:18:51,391
haven't gone missing.

263
00:18:53,086 --> 00:18:54,230
I am...

264
00:18:59,955 --> 00:19:01,831
a victim of rape.

265
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:07,141
At first, I was afraid
he'd come back for me...

266
00:19:08,496 --> 00:19:09,641
and hid.

267
00:19:11,306 --> 00:19:12,881
But as time passed,

268
00:19:14,605 --> 00:19:15,911
instead of fear,

269
00:19:17,105 --> 00:19:18,720
the helplessness I felt back then...

270
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:21,791
and rage...

271
00:19:22,945 --> 00:19:24,460
weighed me down.

272
00:19:27,586 --> 00:19:30,661
Why couldn't I do anything then?

273
00:19:32,086 --> 00:19:34,200
Why did I let something
like that happen to me?

274
00:19:36,155 --> 00:19:37,871
I started blaming myself...

275
00:19:39,026 --> 00:19:40,911
and began to hide even more.

276
00:19:45,036 --> 00:19:46,280
But now,

277
00:19:49,135 --> 00:19:50,780
I'm going to overcome it.

278
00:19:52,605 --> 00:19:54,420
Since it's not my fault.

279
00:19:56,716 --> 00:19:58,520
I'm going to the police to file a report.

280
00:19:59,145 --> 00:20:00,391
I'm going to catch him...

281
00:20:01,516 --> 00:20:02,861
and become better.

282
00:20:11,226 --> 00:20:14,141
I admire your courage.

283
00:20:14,466 --> 00:20:16,510
It's not your fault.

284
00:20:16,836 --> 00:20:17,980
Stay strong.

285
00:20:18,435 --> 00:20:20,480
I'm sure he will be caught.

286
00:20:34,986 --> 00:20:37,301
It must've been hard to make this decision.

287
00:20:39,026 --> 00:20:40,871
It's all thanks to Officer Yoo.

288
00:20:41,226 --> 00:20:43,230
- What?
- She protected me...

289
00:20:44,395 --> 00:20:46,000
all night long.

290
00:20:46,395 --> 00:20:47,566
All night long?

291
00:20:47,566 --> 00:20:49,571
She saw the lights stay on in
my room through the window.

292
00:20:49,935 --> 00:20:52,541
I guess she thought I was
anxious and unable to sleep.

293
00:20:55,435 --> 00:20:56,581
So she...

294
00:20:57,405 --> 00:20:59,121
stayed in front of my house all night long.

295
00:21:01,016 --> 00:21:02,220
That's the Newbie I know.

296
00:21:03,586 --> 00:21:06,891
When Officer Yoo came to see me
for the first time, she said...

297
00:21:07,685 --> 00:21:09,061
we need to catch the culprit...

298
00:21:10,455 --> 00:21:12,131
in order for me to be healed.

299
00:21:13,395 --> 00:21:16,026
At first, I thought detectives were
only interested in catching perps...

300
00:21:16,026 --> 00:21:19,071
and doubted she cared about
whether I was healed or not.

301
00:21:20,836 --> 00:21:22,141
But after that night,

302
00:21:23,095 --> 00:21:25,210
I realized how Officer Yoo truly felt.

303
00:21:26,605 --> 00:21:27,811
This way.

304
00:21:31,205 --> 00:21:32,280
Ye Na.

305
00:21:40,855 --> 00:21:42,460
Thank you for mustering up the courage.

306
00:21:45,726 --> 00:21:46,831
No problem.

307
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:55,411
It seemed like he worked
at the subway station.

308
00:21:55,695 --> 00:21:57,881
He said he was working at the station...

309
00:21:58,536 --> 00:22:01,151
and saw me passing by with thick makeup on.

310
00:22:01,675 --> 00:22:03,420
And he also saw me drunk
in the early morning.

311
00:22:04,276 --> 00:22:05,905
He said the reason I had
fun at clubs all night...

312
00:22:05,905 --> 00:22:07,791
was just to flirt with guys.

313
00:22:08,945 --> 00:22:10,220
I remember him saying that.

314
00:22:10,345 --> 00:22:12,720
The light bulb at my house was flickering...

315
00:22:12,945 --> 00:22:15,155
and he said he was familiar
with electric wiring.

316
00:22:15,155 --> 00:22:17,401
He said he'd fix it for
me and opened his bag.

317
00:22:17,685 --> 00:22:19,401
I saw tools inside.

318
00:22:19,526 --> 00:22:21,296
So I thought he worked in that field.

319
00:22:21,296 --> 00:22:24,401
Electric work at the subway station?

320
00:22:25,726 --> 00:22:27,641
Ye Na, is there anything you remember?

321
00:22:28,266 --> 00:22:30,010
He had hurt his ankle.

322
00:22:30,506 --> 00:22:32,905
It was wrapped up in a pretty thick bandage.

323
00:22:32,905 --> 00:22:35,210
- Right, I remember that too.
- Me too.

324
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:37,675
Then he must've limped...

325
00:22:37,675 --> 00:22:38,976
or had trouble walking.

326
00:22:38,976 --> 00:22:40,845
He didn't look uncomfortable at all.

327
00:22:40,845 --> 00:22:42,816
Right, he didn't limp.

328
00:22:42,816 --> 00:22:44,945
He had a thick bandage around his ankle...

329
00:22:44,945 --> 00:22:46,891
but didn't limp?

330
00:22:50,756 --> 00:22:52,700
- Hold on.
- Don't tell me...

331
00:22:53,355 --> 00:22:54,601
- An ankle monitor?
- An ankle monitor?

332
00:22:56,496 --> 00:22:57,726
Let's check with the control center.

333
00:22:57,726 --> 00:22:59,940
We already know the time
and location of the crime.

334
00:23:00,536 --> 00:23:01,895
Let's check the records of ankle monitors,

335
00:23:01,895 --> 00:23:03,940
and if there's someone who
was there at that time,

336
00:23:04,236 --> 00:23:05,365
that will be him.

337
00:23:05,365 --> 00:23:06,811
- I'll call them.
- Okay.

338
00:23:10,875 --> 00:23:12,051
Let's go.

339
00:23:16,076 --> 00:23:17,591
It must've been hard for you.

340
00:23:18,816 --> 00:23:20,230
You made the right choice.

341
00:23:22,316 --> 00:23:25,131
Now, we'll catch him by all means.

342
00:23:29,326 --> 00:23:30,670
We found a match.

343
00:23:32,066 --> 00:23:34,041
Name, Hwang Chi Wol, age 32.

344
00:23:34,095 --> 00:23:36,541
He is currently at... Dodang Station.

345
00:23:36,935 --> 00:23:38,010
Let's move.

346
00:23:42,276 --> 00:23:45,145
Hey, did you see this?
It's Avocado's confession video.

347
00:23:45,145 --> 00:23:47,891
Yes, I saw it.
It seems like there are more victims.

348
00:23:48,175 --> 00:23:50,316
That's so creepy. I hope he's caught soon.

349
00:23:50,316 --> 00:23:53,190
- I feel so bad for her.
- That's so scary.

350
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:18,480
Where is he right now?

351
00:24:19,645 --> 00:24:20,891
This way, through the entrance.

352
00:24:25,945 --> 00:24:27,061
What?

353
00:24:27,685 --> 00:24:29,561
- The signal just stopped.
- Where?

354
00:24:29,816 --> 00:24:31,061
It's around here.

355
00:24:44,905 --> 00:24:46,381
What are you doing?

356
00:24:46,875 --> 00:24:47,980
I'm sorry.

357
00:24:49,175 --> 00:24:50,381
Woo Hyuk, here.

358
00:24:59,246 --> 00:25:00,530
What? He cut it?

359
00:25:00,685 --> 00:25:03,460
We were blocking this exit,
and the other exits are far away.

360
00:25:03,986 --> 00:25:05,486
He probably didn't make it out yet.

361
00:25:05,486 --> 00:25:07,601
What use is that? There are 10 exits here.

362
00:25:07,826 --> 00:25:09,331
We can't block all of them.

363
00:25:12,066 --> 00:25:13,710
You can't go out right now.

364
00:25:15,935 --> 00:25:17,141
It's a civil defense drill.

365
00:25:17,506 --> 00:25:19,010
Then the exits are probably blocked.

366
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:21,151
How long will the drill last?

367
00:25:21,405 --> 00:25:22,705
20 minutes. We can find him before it ends.

368
00:25:22,705 --> 00:25:24,576
All right, let's split up.

369
00:25:24,576 --> 00:25:26,075
Inspector Ko take exits 1 to 3,

370
00:25:26,076 --> 00:25:28,275
Officer Yoo take 4 to 6,
and I'll take the rest.

371
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:29,716
The train is arriving in four minutes,

372
00:25:29,716 --> 00:25:30,986
so you can stay on the platform.

373
00:25:30,986 --> 00:25:32,361
- Okay.
- Wait.

374
00:25:32,845 --> 00:25:35,161
He probably knows the exits are blocked.
He'd use another route.

375
00:25:36,385 --> 00:25:39,301
If he works at the station,
that means he knows this place well.

376
00:25:40,695 --> 00:25:42,796
We need to find a place where he would hide.

377
00:25:42,796 --> 00:25:44,041
What is she saying?

378
00:25:45,296 --> 00:25:46,700
What are you doing...

379
00:25:48,496 --> 00:25:51,780
First, behind the vending
machine at the platform.

380
00:26:05,046 --> 00:26:07,185
If you go down, behind platform 1-3,

381
00:26:07,185 --> 00:26:09,391
there's a small storage room that
stores vending machine items.

382
00:26:09,655 --> 00:26:11,700
It's hidden behind a pillar, so check there.

383
00:26:12,026 --> 00:26:14,056
Next to the stairs past the
turnstiles toward Isu Station,

384
00:26:14,056 --> 00:26:15,625
there's a small room used by janitors.

385
00:26:15,625 --> 00:26:16,901
Please check there too.

386
00:26:17,766 --> 00:26:19,365
If you pass the elevator and go downstairs,

387
00:26:19,365 --> 00:26:21,266
there's a machine room on the right.

388
00:26:21,266 --> 00:26:23,071
- Machine room.
- Check there too.

389
00:26:23,605 --> 00:26:25,911
I'll go check any other secluded areas.

390
00:26:26,036 --> 00:26:27,135
Where are you getting all of this?

391
00:26:27,135 --> 00:26:29,036
I know, what are you saying?
Just follow my instructions...

392
00:26:29,036 --> 00:26:31,220
No. Let's do as Newbie says.

393
00:26:31,945 --> 00:26:33,950
Let's go. Move.

394
00:26:39,746 --> 00:26:40,930
My goodness.

395
00:27:17,786 --> 00:27:18,930
He's not here.

396
00:27:19,586 --> 00:27:21,631
We only have a minute left. What now?

397
00:27:21,726 --> 00:27:24,301
Newbie, think carefully.
Is there any place you missed?

398
00:27:26,566 --> 00:27:28,841
If the Commissioner finds out
we missed him like this...

399
00:27:30,236 --> 00:27:32,736
Woo Hyuk,
we need to search this entire area.

400
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:34,381
Call the station for backup.

401
00:27:34,435 --> 00:27:36,911
- That place.
- What? Where?

402
00:27:38,175 --> 00:27:41,250
If he really does electric
work at the station,

403
00:27:41,345 --> 00:27:42,615
there's a place where a
sign was about to go up...

404
00:27:42,615 --> 00:27:44,321
and the walls were
drilled for electric work.

405
00:27:44,586 --> 00:27:47,230
But that place became a storage
room after the work was canceled.

406
00:27:50,826 --> 00:27:52,101
Hey, can you finish your sentence?

407
00:28:34,895 --> 00:28:36,635
You are under arrest for serial rape...

408
00:28:36,635 --> 00:28:38,740
Move!

409
00:28:41,175 --> 00:28:43,821
Come on. You want a piece of me?

410
00:28:51,816 --> 00:28:53,760
The electric currents
are pretty strong here.

411
00:28:57,016 --> 00:28:58,200
Raise your hands.

412
00:28:59,486 --> 00:29:02,401
Turn around and get up against the wall.

413
00:29:02,996 --> 00:29:05,440
Against the wall! Hey, you!

414
00:29:06,796 --> 00:29:09,010
Do you want to kill us all?

415
00:29:11,336 --> 00:29:12,680
Well, I really don't care.

416
00:29:13,435 --> 00:29:15,551
Get up against the wall now.

417
00:29:16,276 --> 00:29:18,480
Move, now!

418
00:29:27,185 --> 00:29:28,591
Newbie!

419
00:29:45,705 --> 00:29:48,236
Are you awake? Here, look at me.

420
00:29:48,236 --> 00:29:52,081
That was self-defense.
You threatened an officer first.

421
00:29:52,205 --> 00:29:56,051
No matter what excuse you make later
on, it'll be no use.

422
00:29:56,476 --> 00:29:57,891
Let's see.

423
00:30:00,185 --> 00:30:02,716
Get up. You won't die from
being electrocuted for a second.

424
00:30:02,716 --> 00:30:04,530
We're not responsible for that.

425
00:30:05,125 --> 00:30:06,226
What are you doing?

426
00:30:06,226 --> 00:30:09,496
We're sometimes billed for
stuff we didn't even break.

427
00:30:09,496 --> 00:30:10,670
Let me see.

428
00:30:14,066 --> 00:30:17,210
Get up, before I electrocute you again.

429
00:30:20,466 --> 00:30:21,750
Come on, get up.

430
00:30:22,405 --> 00:30:23,874
Chief, here you go.

431
00:30:23,875 --> 00:30:26,780
It was very wise of you to
lower that switch quickly.

432
00:30:26,806 --> 00:30:28,151
Thank you.

433
00:30:28,216 --> 00:30:29,476
No need to thank me.

434
00:30:29,476 --> 00:30:30,545
Let's go.

435
00:30:30,546 --> 00:30:32,321
How dare you mess with electricity?

436
00:30:36,816 --> 00:30:40,000
We thought he was a
pickpocket, but that wasn't it.

437
00:30:40,526 --> 00:30:42,071
Excuse me, Chief.

438
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:48,371
Hello?

439
00:30:49,095 --> 00:30:52,735
Yes. I'm Officer Yoo,
who came to see you before.

440
00:30:52,736 --> 00:30:55,581
Oh, yes. Can I help you?

441
00:30:55,736 --> 00:30:59,405
About that wallet you
said was stolen before.

442
00:30:59,405 --> 00:31:02,051
I remember you saying
someone found it for you.

443
00:31:02,246 --> 00:31:03,546
Did you get it back?

444
00:31:03,546 --> 00:31:05,621
No, I'm on my way to get it now...

445
00:31:07,316 --> 00:31:08,891
What? Hello?

446
00:31:09,655 --> 00:31:10,901
What?

447
00:31:11,425 --> 00:31:12,730
Hello?

448
00:31:13,286 --> 00:31:15,500
I'm here to get it now. What is this about?

449
00:31:15,895 --> 00:31:18,325
There's a pickpocket case
that turned out to be...

450
00:31:18,326 --> 00:31:19,871
for a different purpose, and it worried me.

451
00:31:20,326 --> 00:31:24,141
Yes, I remember you saying you
thought you were pickpocketed.

452
00:31:24,165 --> 00:31:26,311
Okay, Officer.

453
00:31:28,105 --> 00:31:29,180
Get in.

454
00:31:30,236 --> 00:31:31,381
Get in.

455
00:31:32,605 --> 00:31:34,375
I'll leave him to you guys now.

456
00:31:34,375 --> 00:31:36,091
- Okay, good work.
- All right.

457
00:31:47,595 --> 00:31:49,871
(Authorized Personnel Only)

458
00:32:41,076 --> 00:32:42,190
Newbie.

459
00:32:43,716 --> 00:32:45,391
Last time, what you said...

460
00:32:46,415 --> 00:32:48,530
about you wanting to switch partners.

461
00:32:50,355 --> 00:32:52,161
I thought about it...

462
00:32:53,226 --> 00:32:54,930
Let's go, Partner.

463
00:32:55,026 --> 00:32:57,226
- What?
- What are you doing?

464
00:32:57,226 --> 00:32:58,826
We still have some investigation work left,

465
00:32:58,826 --> 00:33:00,595
so she's still my partner.

466
00:33:00,595 --> 00:33:02,371
Take care of it on your own.

467
00:33:03,895 --> 00:33:05,581
We also have work to do.

468
00:33:07,435 --> 00:33:08,811
You can come with me.

469
00:33:09,075 --> 00:33:11,121
Come with me.

470
00:33:15,316 --> 00:33:16,421
Newbie.

471
00:33:17,515 --> 00:33:18,921
Just keep...

472
00:33:20,486 --> 00:33:21,990
being my partner.

473
00:33:29,455 --> 00:33:30,630
To be honest,

474
00:33:32,066 --> 00:33:34,840
I really had a hard time working with you.

475
00:33:35,495 --> 00:33:36,740
Instead of you,

476
00:33:37,705 --> 00:33:39,935
it'll be much more comfortable
working with an obedient officer.

477
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:41,050
But...

478
00:33:44,406 --> 00:33:46,550
I don't know what's wrong with me either.

479
00:33:48,075 --> 00:33:49,990
Whether it's because of a
ridiculous sense of responsibility,

480
00:33:51,015 --> 00:33:52,891
or if I'm just being stubborn.

481
00:33:54,316 --> 00:33:56,331
I really have no idea.

482
00:33:58,386 --> 00:33:59,601
But let's just...

483
00:34:01,256 --> 00:34:02,771
remain as partners.

484
00:34:12,066 --> 00:34:15,311
I'll return after solving this case.

485
00:34:15,736 --> 00:34:16,981
Newbie.

486
00:34:17,506 --> 00:34:18,650
Let's go.

487
00:34:53,605 --> 00:34:55,421
Can I help you?

488
00:34:57,015 --> 00:35:00,391
Oh, I've been transferred
to Wangsoori Team Two.

489
00:35:00,616 --> 00:35:03,391
- Transferred?
- No... It's me.

490
00:35:04,886 --> 00:35:06,161
Chief Inspector Gong.

491
00:35:10,055 --> 00:35:11,200
Yes.

492
00:35:11,426 --> 00:35:12,596
I respect you.

493
00:35:12,596 --> 00:35:14,001
I hear that all the time.

494
00:35:14,995 --> 00:35:17,880
Wait a minute. Where is your partner?

495
00:35:20,605 --> 00:35:22,550
There's something I ordered her to do.

496
00:35:23,236 --> 00:35:24,406
She'll come back after that.

497
00:35:24,406 --> 00:35:27,621
Is that so? She's really good.

498
00:35:28,075 --> 00:35:29,220
Good luck.

499
00:35:36,915 --> 00:35:38,501
Hello?

500
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:41,625
Oh, is there someone who'll buy the house?

501
00:35:41,625 --> 00:35:44,995
But the buyer has a special request...

502
00:35:44,995 --> 00:35:47,736
and is asking if you can
move out within a week.

503
00:35:47,736 --> 00:35:49,811
Of course. I can move out immediately.

504
00:35:49,995 --> 00:35:52,435
That's great.
Let's sign the papers today then.

505
00:35:52,435 --> 00:35:55,180
All right. I'll call you
later before I visit. Okay.

506
00:36:02,116 --> 00:36:04,421
I don't even have a home now.

507
00:36:07,756 --> 00:36:09,891
(Seoun Metropolitan Police Agency)

508
00:36:10,316 --> 00:36:12,925
You have 12 previous
convictions, including rape,

509
00:36:12,926 --> 00:36:14,255
inflicting bodily injury, and assault.

510
00:36:14,256 --> 00:36:18,066
You were teased for being short
and insulted for being uneducated.

511
00:36:18,066 --> 00:36:20,900
That's why your anger
for society grew larger?

512
00:36:22,535 --> 00:36:26,105
Jerks like you stay at the
victims' homes as long as possible.

513
00:36:26,105 --> 00:36:29,711
To enjoy the feeling of superiority
you can't feel in society.

514
00:36:29,875 --> 00:36:32,081
That's why catching punks like you is easy.

515
00:36:32,705 --> 00:36:34,875
The longer you stay,

516
00:36:34,875 --> 00:36:36,990
the more evidence you leave behind.

517
00:36:39,645 --> 00:36:43,430
That's interesting.
Why don't you write a novel?

518
00:36:43,986 --> 00:36:46,400
You have such a huge imagination.

519
00:36:48,055 --> 00:36:50,130
Why does he sound so confident?

520
00:36:51,096 --> 00:36:52,695
I heard you even fixed
the electric wiring...

521
00:36:52,696 --> 00:36:53,800
at someone's house.

522
00:36:55,165 --> 00:36:58,141
We just lifted the
fingerprints from the bulb...

523
00:36:58,705 --> 00:37:01,251
and we have a very clear fingerprint.

524
00:37:02,435 --> 00:37:04,304
Whether it's your body hair or skin tissue,

525
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:06,581
I'm certain there's some
of it left in the room.

526
00:37:07,176 --> 00:37:09,975
Usually, the victim sweeps
and wipes the room...

527
00:37:09,975 --> 00:37:12,285
and cleans the whole house,
so it's difficult to find.

528
00:37:12,285 --> 00:37:13,490
However...

529
00:37:14,555 --> 00:37:18,231
I don't know how much you
humiliated and scared them,

530
00:37:18,386 --> 00:37:21,671
but the victims left without
cleaning their homes at all.

531
00:37:22,296 --> 00:37:25,400
Thanks to that, the evidence will
have been preserved perfectly.

532
00:37:25,495 --> 00:37:29,411

you're just speculating.

00:37:58,196 --> 00:37:59,771
They asked for it!

541
00:38:00,265 --> 00:38:03,494
They wear those skimpy clothes
and look for guys all night.

542
00:38:03,495 --> 00:38:04,981
How perfect.

543
00:38:05,506 --> 00:38:07,481
Evidence and a confession.

544
00:38:27,926 --> 00:38:30,601
Call me if it gets too hard.

545
00:38:33,466 --> 00:38:36,671
If you can't sleep or have a nightmare...

546
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:41,280
Even if you call at 3am, I'll pick up.

547
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:48,276
"The serial rape case that
almost went unnoticed..."

548
00:38:48,276 --> 00:38:51,050
"was uncovered thanks to the
police's tenacious pursuit."

549
00:38:52,446 --> 00:38:54,386
I told them...

550
00:38:54,386 --> 00:38:57,116
to add Lieutenant Ha's
name to the headline...

551
00:38:57,116 --> 00:39:01,256
Check the facts before writing articles.

552
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:03,926
- Pardon?
- The name that belongs there...

553
00:39:03,926 --> 00:39:06,441
is Officer Yoo Ryung of Subway Police.

554
00:39:07,796 --> 00:39:09,411
Yoo Ryung?

555
00:39:10,236 --> 00:39:11,340
Madam Commissioner.

556
00:39:12,935 --> 00:39:15,581
Lieutenant Ha. Don't you know how to knock?

557
00:39:23,216 --> 00:39:24,490
I'll go...

558
00:39:25,386 --> 00:39:26,561
check the facts.

559
00:39:37,495 --> 00:39:39,941
Nothing I do satisfies you, right?

560
00:39:40,995 --> 00:39:42,566
What's gotten into you?

561
00:39:42,566 --> 00:39:45,711
When I was little, I worked hard to
meet my successful mom's standards,

562
00:39:46,506 --> 00:39:50,311
When I grew up, I worked hard to
avoid being compared to my mom.

563
00:39:50,676 --> 00:39:51,676
Ma Ri.

564
00:39:51,676 --> 00:39:54,645
I'll never satisfy you anyway,
so I kind of want to quit,

565
00:39:54,645 --> 00:39:55,720
but then,

566
00:39:56,946 --> 00:39:59,860
I want to succeed and show you.

567
00:40:02,256 --> 00:40:03,360
I don't know.

568
00:40:05,625 --> 00:40:08,371
Here's the report on the
Hongdae Club Serial Rape case.

569
00:40:08,696 --> 00:40:09,800
Please review it.

570
00:40:11,096 --> 00:40:12,601
What's wrong with you now?

571
00:40:16,596 --> 00:40:19,610
You knew why Ji Seok dumped me, didn't you?

572
00:40:20,636 --> 00:40:23,110
What are you talking about?

573
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:26,720
When we were dating,

574
00:40:27,245 --> 00:40:29,691
you liked him more than me.

575
00:40:30,446 --> 00:40:32,946
You said you'd make him
the next head of Metro.

576
00:40:32,946 --> 00:40:36,515
But when he dumped me and said
he'd join the Subway Police...

577
00:40:36,515 --> 00:40:38,400
out of the blue,
why did you let him go without a word?

578
00:40:38,685 --> 00:40:40,260
Why? Why did you do it?

579
00:40:55,776 --> 00:40:57,811
Since your mother's sick,

580
00:40:58,575 --> 00:41:01,691
I won't stop you from
joining the Subway Police,

581
00:41:02,875 --> 00:41:05,391
but why are you asking me to
keep it a secret from Ma Ri?

582
00:41:06,116 --> 00:41:08,030
I have no money and no future.

583
00:41:10,455 --> 00:41:12,030
I feel too bad for Ma Ri.

584
00:41:13,086 --> 00:41:16,300
You're so stupid nice.

585
00:41:23,136 --> 00:41:25,610
Did Ji Seok tell you?

586
00:41:25,836 --> 00:41:26,911
So it's true.

587
00:41:31,176 --> 00:41:33,581
He's pretending to be his late dad.

588
00:41:34,046 --> 00:41:35,820
Goodness, Ji Seok...

589
00:41:40,185 --> 00:41:42,430
Took you long enough, detective.

590
00:41:53,866 --> 00:41:55,010
Gosh.

591
00:42:02,736 --> 00:42:03,880
I'm sorry.

592
00:42:04,236 --> 00:42:07,720
You keep paying me late,
so I can't keep working for you.

593
00:42:09,216 --> 00:42:11,421
I sold my place,

594
00:42:11,816 --> 00:42:14,245
so I'll be able to pay you soon.
Just a few more days.

595
00:42:14,245 --> 00:42:17,561
I use that to pay rent and pay for expenses.

596
00:42:17,816 --> 00:42:20,526
I feel bad always paying late,
even if it's by a few days.

597
00:42:20,526 --> 00:42:22,371
- I'll do...
- Here you are.

598
00:42:23,096 --> 00:42:25,300
The management office is throwing a fit.

599
00:42:25,426 --> 00:42:28,110
The machine your mother fried...

600
00:42:29,796 --> 00:42:31,406
They say to pay for the machine right away,

601
00:42:31,406 --> 00:42:32,935
or you'll get in trouble.

602
00:42:32,935 --> 00:42:35,851
Okay, then. Thank you for everything.

603
00:42:36,776 --> 00:42:38,780
Wait. Ma'am. Ma'am!

604
00:42:46,515 --> 00:42:48,630
(Raise Dementia Awareness)

605
00:42:52,756 --> 00:42:54,061
Come in.

606
00:42:59,926 --> 00:43:02,110
Excuse me, can we talk?

607
00:43:04,765 --> 00:43:07,211
Can you really start right away?

608
00:43:07,535 --> 00:43:09,680
I feel bad for you.

609
00:43:10,776 --> 00:43:12,880
I have a child too,

610
00:43:14,305 --> 00:43:18,320
but as a mom,
I just couldn't ignore your situation.

611
00:43:19,116 --> 00:43:21,530
Thank you.

612
00:43:21,886 --> 00:43:25,325
You can pay me late, as long as you pay me.

613
00:43:25,325 --> 00:43:27,530
Don't worry. I'm a cop,

614
00:43:27,586 --> 00:43:29,671
so I can't stiff you or I'll get in trouble.

615
00:43:33,596 --> 00:43:36,470
Please take good care of my mother.

616
00:43:37,466 --> 00:43:38,581
Also...

617
00:43:39,466 --> 00:43:40,541
May I?

618
00:43:41,836 --> 00:43:42,981
Yes.

619
00:43:50,645 --> 00:43:52,090
Here's my number.

620
00:43:52,415 --> 00:43:53,885
Call me...

621
00:43:53,886 --> 00:43:56,855
whenever you want.
If you'd tell me how she's doing,

622
00:43:56,855 --> 00:43:59,831
how her health is, what food she ate well,

623
00:44:03,055 --> 00:44:04,941
any little thing,

624
00:44:06,026 --> 00:44:07,740
I'd really appreciate it.

625
00:44:08,535 --> 00:44:09,671
Okay.

626
00:44:48,136 --> 00:44:50,081
I'm looking for a place right now.

627
00:44:50,236 --> 00:44:53,081
I'll put my things in
storage for a month for now.

628
00:44:53,475 --> 00:44:57,590
If I can't find a place to live by
then, I can extend it, right?

629
00:44:58,285 --> 00:45:00,021
Yes.

630
00:45:02,955 --> 00:45:04,030
What the...

631
00:45:04,415 --> 00:45:05,630
Let me call you back.

632
00:45:08,495 --> 00:45:10,570
(Moving Equipment Rental)

633
00:46:32,176 --> 00:46:36,791
When I look at you

634
00:46:39,245 --> 00:46:40,791
I remember

635
00:46:41,415 --> 00:46:43,430
You must drive once the light turns green.

636
00:46:44,256 --> 00:46:46,800
Either go straight or turn.

637
00:46:47,926 --> 00:46:49,771
Even if you haven't made a decision,

638
00:46:50,725 --> 00:46:52,101
you must still drive.

639
00:46:53,796 --> 00:46:55,165
The times we shared

640
00:46:55,165 --> 00:46:57,711
That's how my life has
been the past two years.

641
00:47:03,375 --> 00:47:05,351
I drove without knowing where I was going.

642
00:47:07,145 --> 00:47:08,521
I had no time to be hurt,

643
00:47:09,346 --> 00:47:10,990
so I kept driving not
realizing I was hurting.

644
00:47:13,015 --> 00:47:17,260
So why does the wound on the
palm of my hand suddenly hurt?

645
00:47:18,685 --> 00:47:19,900
Why now,

646
00:47:20,986 --> 00:47:22,800
do I want to know where I'm going?

647
00:47:32,006 --> 00:47:35,751
(Wangsoori Station)

648
00:47:39,906 --> 00:47:41,180
Sorry I'm late.

649
00:47:41,946 --> 00:47:43,421
Chief, what happened to your hand?

650
00:47:43,776 --> 00:47:46,220
Good news.
There's an opening in another team.

651
00:47:46,886 --> 00:47:48,220
Hi, Officer Yoo.

652
00:47:54,355 --> 00:47:56,171
I look forward to working with you.

653
00:47:57,796 --> 00:48:00,125
I saw firsthand how hard you work.

654
00:48:00,125 --> 00:48:01,541
Let's see.

655
00:48:03,435 --> 00:48:05,305
Pick up some makeup tips from me,

656
00:48:05,305 --> 00:48:07,041
then you'll be the ace of the Subway Police.

657
00:48:08,105 --> 00:48:10,935
I'll bring some outfits and wigs tomorrow...

658
00:48:10,935 --> 00:48:13,421
that will suit you. See you tomorrow. Later.

659
00:48:18,886 --> 00:48:20,720
We alternate shifts with them,

660
00:48:20,785 --> 00:48:23,615
so even if we share an
office, you'll hardly see me.

661
00:48:23,616 --> 00:48:25,061
Chief.

662
00:48:25,386 --> 00:48:26,885
I understand.

663
00:48:26,886 --> 00:48:27,955
Sorry?

664
00:48:27,955 --> 00:48:31,171
I understand why you don't
want to be my partner.

665
00:48:31,665 --> 00:48:34,225
Chief, it's not that I don't want to...

666
00:48:34,225 --> 00:48:35,911
I had this thought today.

667
00:48:37,935 --> 00:48:40,541
I don't know where I'm going either.

668
00:48:41,165 --> 00:48:43,110
You must have been so anxious...

669
00:48:43,776 --> 00:48:45,621
following someone like me around.

670
00:48:51,176 --> 00:48:52,691
Sorry about everything.

671
00:48:55,156 --> 00:48:58,661
The night duty room must have been
so uncomfortable. I've been so busy.

672
00:49:01,225 --> 00:49:02,930
I'm sorry for so many things.

673
00:49:09,336 --> 00:49:10,911
(Ha Ma Ri)

674
00:49:13,765 --> 00:49:14,935
Hey.

675
00:49:14,935 --> 00:49:16,650
Let's meet.

676
00:49:16,975 --> 00:49:19,150
It's not about work, so let's meet outside.

677
00:49:19,276 --> 00:49:20,621
Just us two?

678
00:49:24,276 --> 00:49:25,461
Now?

679
00:49:26,285 --> 00:49:28,121
Yes, I know the restaurant.

680
00:49:28,855 --> 00:49:30,061
Okay.

681
00:49:30,886 --> 00:49:32,030
(Ha Ma Ri)

682
00:49:32,486 --> 00:49:33,756
I'm going to head out.

683
00:49:33,756 --> 00:49:35,070
- Okay.
- Okay.

684
00:49:38,495 --> 00:49:40,771
- Goodnight.
- Bye.

685
00:49:43,336 --> 00:49:46,680
It's the first time they're meeting
alone since they broke up, right?

686
00:49:47,136 --> 00:49:50,650
What does his first love
and ex-girlfriend want?

687
00:50:04,461 --> 00:50:06,177
First love.

688
00:50:10,501 --> 00:50:12,177
What's it to me?

689
00:50:15,071 --> 00:50:16,286
(Chief Inspector Ko Ji Seok)

690
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:20,686
Yes, Chief.

691
00:50:21,751 --> 00:50:25,427
I forgot to tell you what you
need to do before you leave.

692
00:50:26,921 --> 00:50:28,021
Okay.

693
00:50:28,021 --> 00:50:30,297
I'll tell you now, so record the call.

694
00:50:30,852 --> 00:50:32,067
Okay.

695
00:50:34,662 --> 00:50:38,007
First, go through the
cases you need to pass on.

696
00:50:38,332 --> 00:50:41,102
Case files for the Grasshoppers
and the Avocado case.

697
00:50:41,102 --> 00:50:43,332
Separate the victims' statements.

698
00:50:43,332 --> 00:50:45,001
- The socks are a dollar each.
- Finally,

699
00:50:45,001 --> 00:50:49,016
go through the items you were issued
and check what you must leave.

700
00:50:49,271 --> 00:50:52,717
Especially the team's
equipment must be left behind.

701
00:50:53,582 --> 00:50:55,157
I'm almost at my destination.

702
00:50:56,052 --> 00:50:57,556
Please take care of that stuff.

703
00:50:58,552 --> 00:50:59,726
Yes, sir.

704
00:51:32,052 --> 00:51:33,226
Ma Ri.

705
00:51:35,591 --> 00:51:36,967
Mi Hyun!

706
00:51:40,921 --> 00:51:41,932
When are you done today?

707
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:44,436
Not yet. I need to check her.

708
00:51:45,231 --> 00:51:47,177
Hello.

709
00:51:47,602 --> 00:51:50,872
I'm Ae Shim, I'm kind of close...

710
00:51:50,872 --> 00:51:52,677
with her.

711
00:51:54,202 --> 00:51:57,646
Hello. I'm Yoo Ryung.

712
00:51:58,171 --> 00:52:00,857
What a scary name.

713
00:52:02,812 --> 00:52:04,082
Go on.

714
00:52:04,082 --> 00:52:05,582
- Okay.
- Wait for me.

715
00:52:05,582 --> 00:52:06,896
Bye.

716
00:52:07,222 --> 00:52:08,697
Bye.

717
00:52:10,651 --> 00:52:11,866
Bye.

718
00:52:16,291 --> 00:52:17,536
Ae Shim.

719
00:52:19,662 --> 00:52:22,001
It's time to go home.

720
00:52:22,001 --> 00:52:23,306
Okay.

721
00:52:37,481 --> 00:52:40,122
She looked young. What a shame.

722
00:52:40,122 --> 00:52:42,967
She thinks she's 18 and
doesn't recognize her own son.

723
00:52:43,052 --> 00:52:45,492
But her son is amazing.

724
00:52:45,492 --> 00:52:47,567
He visits his mom every other day.

725
00:52:47,921 --> 00:52:49,266
What a good son.

726
00:52:50,191 --> 00:52:53,007
Don't you have anyone who
can eat noodles with you?

727
00:52:54,202 --> 00:52:57,202
And go grocery shopping
and cook some real food.

728
00:52:57,202 --> 00:52:58,841
You always eat instant foods.

729
00:52:58,841 --> 00:53:01,076
Grocery shopping? That just a pain.

730
00:53:01,972 --> 00:53:03,516
You're lonely, right?

731
00:53:04,041 --> 00:53:06,116
Yes, I'm lonely.

732
00:53:07,211 --> 00:53:09,651
I'm lonely too.

733
00:53:09,651 --> 00:53:12,056
I have work to do later.

734
00:53:13,651 --> 00:53:15,096
Just one.

735
00:53:18,461 --> 00:53:20,036
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

736
00:53:22,691 --> 00:53:24,737
Ever since we broke up...

737
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:26,777
until yesterday,

738
00:53:28,501 --> 00:53:30,146
I wondered every day...

739
00:53:31,102 --> 00:53:33,346
why you dumped me.

740
00:53:34,742 --> 00:53:36,011
Did you find another girl?

741
00:53:36,012 --> 00:53:38,857
Or did you get tired of
hearing people say that...

742
00:53:39,742 --> 00:53:42,556
you were dating the Commissioner's
bad-tempered daughter...

743
00:53:44,312 --> 00:53:47,297
because you were blinded by ambition?

744
00:53:50,952 --> 00:53:52,936
Or were you sick of me...

745
00:53:55,062 --> 00:53:57,166
with my nasty temper?

746
00:53:58,602 --> 00:53:59,976
Sorry for...

747
00:54:01,231 --> 00:54:02,302
not telling you.

748
00:54:02,302 --> 00:54:04,547
Was I that untrustworthy?

749
00:54:05,202 --> 00:54:07,271
If you said you were going
to the Subway Police...

750
00:54:07,271 --> 00:54:09,317
because your mom was sick,
I would've understood.

751
00:54:12,782 --> 00:54:14,416
Our breakup was a misunderstanding.

752
00:54:18,952 --> 00:54:20,096
Ma Ri.

753
00:54:22,291 --> 00:54:24,596
I have nothing to do for you now.

754
00:54:25,861 --> 00:54:27,766
I can't promise a future.

755
00:54:32,461 --> 00:54:33,777
It's not a misunderstanding.

756
00:54:33,832 --> 00:54:35,107
Yes, it is.

757
00:54:35,702 --> 00:54:38,007
I never asked you to promise me a future.

758
00:54:42,171 --> 00:54:44,487
Whether you get sick of me first
or I get sick of you first,

759
00:54:45,041 --> 00:54:46,987
let's break up again...

760
00:54:48,751 --> 00:54:52,257
when we get sick of each other. Not now.

761
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:00,837
You asked him for a new partner?

762
00:55:02,392 --> 00:55:06,231
He was so good to you.
You should've made an excuse.

763
00:55:06,231 --> 00:55:08,702
If you suddenly say you
don't want to work with him,

764
00:55:08,702 --> 00:55:11,246
of course, he'd be hurt.

765
00:55:11,771 --> 00:55:13,102
Do you think he got hurt?

766
00:55:13,102 --> 00:55:14,317
Of course.

767
00:55:15,211 --> 00:55:17,146
Call him right now and apologize.

768
00:55:17,872 --> 00:55:19,782
"It's because of something else."

769
00:55:19,782 --> 00:55:22,627
"It isn't your fault, so don't be hurt."

770
00:55:23,981 --> 00:55:25,326
Now.

771
00:55:25,921 --> 00:55:27,496
- Now.
- Okay.

772
00:55:28,492 --> 00:55:30,127
Let's see.

773
00:55:33,392 --> 00:55:35,507
- Hurry.
- Okay.

774
00:55:41,131 --> 00:55:42,401
He isn't picking up.

775
00:55:42,401 --> 00:55:45,032
He's with his first love,
so I'll try again later.

776
00:55:45,032 --> 00:55:46,541
Leave him a voicemail.

777
00:55:46,541 --> 00:55:50,012
You were horrible to him.
How dare you put it off? Do it.

778
00:55:50,012 --> 00:55:51,286
- A voicemail.
- Go on.

779
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:59,381
- Your call is being forwarded...
- Voicemail.

780
00:55:59,381 --> 00:56:00,657
to voicemail. Please...

781
00:56:07,392 --> 00:56:08,837
Chief.

782
00:56:09,492 --> 00:56:11,166
I'm sorry.

783
00:56:12,302 --> 00:56:15,901
When I asked for a new partner,

784
00:56:15,901 --> 00:56:18,547
it was because something happened.

785
00:56:19,041 --> 00:56:21,547
It wasn't because I don't like you.

786
00:56:22,372 --> 00:56:25,587
I want to keep being...

787
00:56:26,282 --> 00:56:28,627
your partner.

788
00:56:31,012 --> 00:56:32,596
I mean it.

789
00:56:36,091 --> 00:56:37,496
Really.

790
00:56:41,961 --> 00:56:43,137
I want...

791
00:56:44,892 --> 00:56:47,576
to stay by your side.

792
00:56:49,771 --> 00:56:53,947
But if I stay by your side,

793
00:56:55,171 --> 00:56:57,686
I keep wanting to depend on you.

794
00:57:02,881 --> 00:57:05,326
Maybe I should tell you...

795
00:57:06,852 --> 00:57:09,396
why I joined the Subway Police
and what I've been doing...

796
00:57:11,191 --> 00:57:12,596
behind your back.

797
00:57:16,691 --> 00:57:18,607
I want to just tell you everything.

798
00:57:19,202 --> 00:57:20,576
Hey. End it.

799
00:57:22,501 --> 00:57:24,401
I've lost my mind. What did I just say?

800
00:57:24,401 --> 00:57:26,777
Delete it.

801
00:57:28,401 --> 00:57:30,487
- Your message was saved.
- It was saved.

802
00:57:31,872 --> 00:57:32,987
What?

803
00:57:33,242 --> 00:57:35,657
- It was saved.
- Oh no!

804
00:57:35,852 --> 00:57:37,387
I need to delete it.

805
00:57:38,952 --> 00:57:40,782
I need to find the chief.

806
00:57:40,782 --> 00:57:42,666
Do you know where he is?

807
00:57:44,291 --> 00:57:45,396
No, I don't.

808
00:57:48,421 --> 00:57:49,536
I have to find out.

809
00:57:51,361 --> 00:57:52,576
(Recorded call, Chief Inspector Ko Ji Seok)

810
00:57:54,231 --> 00:57:55,802
First, go through the cases...

811
00:57:55,802 --> 00:57:57,976
- you need to pass on.
- The train to Ogeum...

812
00:57:58,131 --> 00:57:59,271
The train to Ogeum...

813
00:57:59,271 --> 00:58:01,001
Ogeum! Then it's line three!

814
00:58:01,001 --> 00:58:03,541
- Case files for the Grasshoppers...
- Of the stores in the station...

815
00:58:03,541 --> 00:58:05,782
Separate the victims' statements.

816
00:58:05,782 --> 00:58:08,142
- Finally...
- Come take a look.

817
00:58:08,142 --> 00:58:09,852
The socks are a dollar each.

818
00:58:09,852 --> 00:58:12,226
- Dollar socks!
- Especially the team's equipment...

819
00:58:12,682 --> 00:58:14,352
- must be left behind.
- Which station has socks stores...

820
00:58:14,352 --> 00:58:16,197
one floor above the platform?

821
00:58:16,722 --> 00:58:17,996
I'm almost at my destination.

822
00:58:18,722 --> 00:58:19,996
Please take care of that stuff.

823
00:58:20,392 --> 00:58:22,507
(Apgujeong)

824
00:58:22,691 --> 00:58:23,837
Found him.

825
00:58:30,702 --> 00:58:32,177
Yes, I know the restaurant.

826
00:58:33,401 --> 00:58:34,616
I'm almost at my destination.

827
00:58:35,341 --> 00:58:36,587
Please take care of that stuff.

828
00:58:36,711 --> 00:58:38,447
His destination...

829
00:58:39,111 --> 00:58:40,786
is a restaurant by the station.

830
00:58:47,282 --> 00:58:48,826
I have to find him.

831
00:58:59,802 --> 00:59:00,907
Is this it?

832
00:59:02,771 --> 00:59:04,206
I'm drawn to it for some reason.

833
00:59:12,912 --> 00:59:14,016
What?

834
00:59:16,611 --> 00:59:17,726
Officer Yoo?

835
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:23,996
I don't think she can see in.

836
00:59:34,702 --> 00:59:37,146
Hello, Chief. Where are you?

837
00:59:37,401 --> 00:59:38,607
In front of you.

838
00:59:40,041 --> 00:59:41,177
What?

839
00:59:43,242 --> 00:59:44,846
I'm where...

840
00:59:45,711 --> 00:59:46,956
you were looking.

841
00:59:49,582 --> 00:59:50,657
Come in.

842
00:59:59,791 --> 01:00:01,536
Did you listen?

843
01:00:01,861 --> 01:00:02,936
To what?

844
01:00:04,091 --> 01:00:05,337
What are you doing here?

845
01:00:06,532 --> 01:00:08,277
I have plans.

846
01:00:08,702 --> 01:00:11,206
- Here?
- Probably.

847
01:00:14,071 --> 01:00:15,317
Were you drinking?

848
01:00:16,111 --> 01:00:17,217
With dinner.

849
01:00:18,541 --> 01:00:19,686
With dinner.

850
01:00:22,352 --> 01:00:23,757
You were meeting your first love.

851
01:00:24,052 --> 01:00:26,427
That's right. His first love.

852
01:00:35,892 --> 01:00:36,992
Oh no.

853
01:00:36,992 --> 01:00:39,507
I'll take this to the bathroom
and dry it right away.

854
01:00:40,001 --> 01:00:41,407
Newbie! New...

855
01:00:52,012 --> 01:00:53,487
Please work.

856
01:00:55,412 --> 01:00:56,527
It worked.

857
01:00:58,352 --> 01:00:59,456
Messages.

858
01:00:59,852 --> 01:01:01,297
(New voice message)

859
01:01:04,191 --> 01:01:06,936
Please enter your password.

860
01:01:10,361 --> 01:01:11,866
Incorrect password.

861
01:01:12,501 --> 01:01:13,677
That's not it.

862
01:01:16,631 --> 01:01:18,377
1, 2, 3, 4.

863
01:01:19,202 --> 01:01:20,777
Incorrect password.

864
01:01:25,642 --> 01:01:26,717
Hold on.

865
01:01:27,512 --> 01:01:29,186
Who checks their voicemail nowadays?

866
01:01:30,952 --> 01:01:32,996
He won't know if I delete the notification.

867
01:01:36,892 --> 01:01:37,921
Delete.

868
01:01:37,921 --> 01:01:39,961
(No messages)

869
01:01:39,961 --> 01:01:41,067
Yes.

870
01:01:41,622 --> 01:01:44,206
I can just bring this back to him.

871
01:01:50,671 --> 01:01:52,346
The phone works. Please give it to him.

872
01:01:56,512 --> 01:01:57,987
You said you had plans here.

873
01:02:00,012 --> 01:02:01,387
My friend says this isn't the place.

874
01:02:01,981 --> 01:02:03,087
Officer Yoo.

875
01:02:12,762 --> 01:02:14,337
Ji Seok doesn't know yet...

876
01:02:14,821 --> 01:02:16,907
why you joined the Subway Police, does he?

877
01:02:18,791 --> 01:02:22,177
That you stole the screen door
key, that you go into the tunnel...

878
01:02:23,001 --> 01:02:26,271
He doesn't know how shamelessly
you've been deceiving him,

879
01:02:26,271 --> 01:02:27,777
does he?

880
01:02:28,872 --> 01:02:30,087
Give it a rest.

881
01:02:31,142 --> 01:02:34,387
I'm using superhuman strength
to keep myself from telling him.

882
01:02:35,312 --> 01:02:36,456
Why?

883
01:02:37,182 --> 01:02:38,887
Why are you keeping it from him?

884
01:02:39,182 --> 01:02:40,396
Don't get the wrong idea.

885
01:02:41,122 --> 01:02:42,427
It's not for you.

886
01:02:43,321 --> 01:02:44,697
It's for him.

887
01:02:45,662 --> 01:02:48,436
Feeling of betrayal by his
partner, skepticism of people...

888
01:02:49,492 --> 01:02:52,007
It'll only upset him if he finds out.
There's no need...

889
01:02:52,461 --> 01:02:54,936
for him to feel that way because of you.

890
01:03:02,512 --> 01:03:04,987
Officer Yoo said she had
the wrong meeting spot.

891
01:03:07,881 --> 01:03:09,387
Let me know once you decide.

892
01:03:13,782 --> 01:03:14,857
Ma Ri.

893
01:03:32,901 --> 01:03:34,217
Our breakup was a misunderstanding.

894
01:03:41,881 --> 01:03:43,027
First love.

895
01:03:47,582 --> 01:03:49,067
It's for the best.

896
01:03:58,492 --> 01:03:59,607
It's for the best.

897
01:04:24,691 --> 01:04:26,338
(Catch the Ghost)

898
01:04:27,361 --> 01:04:28,992
- Your sister was...
- Let's go.

899
01:04:28,992 --> 01:04:30,062
autistic, right?

900
01:04:30,062 --> 01:04:32,576
I wish you'd disappear.

901
01:04:33,602 --> 01:04:35,162
Please help me find my sister.

902
01:04:35,162 --> 01:04:36,976
How did you get separated from her?

903
01:04:37,131 --> 01:04:40,317
The Grasshoppers robbed everyone
while passing through Wangsoori.

904
01:04:40,441 --> 01:04:42,940
- Those punks. Here again?
- Chief.

905
01:04:42,941 --> 01:04:44,217
Fire Chief Ko.

906
01:04:44,912 --> 01:04:47,916
Both Wangsoori and the Grasshoppers
are his responsibilities.

907
01:04:48,012 --> 01:04:49,052
Chief.

908
01:04:49,052 --> 01:04:51,056
We don't need to fight
over things like this anymore.

909
01:04:51,151 --> 01:04:53,826
I need you by my side, Chief.
