{\an8}CATCH THE GHOST

00:00:25,033 --> 00:00:25,967
THIS DRAMA IS FICTION

00:00:26,033 --> 00:00:27,900
THE CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
INSTITUTIONS, AND EVENTS AREN'T REAL

5
00:00:35,233 --> 00:00:37,433
SUBWAY POLICE RECRUITMENT ANNOUNCEMENT

SUBWAY POLICE OFFICE

00:00:39,266 --> 00:00:42,000
{\an8}HIRING : 1 PERSON

00:00:42,066 --> 00:00:43,834
{\an8}APPLIED : 0 PERSON

00:00:44,867 --> 00:00:46,400
{\an8}EPISODE 1

10
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,166
<i>There isn't a problem, right?</i>

11
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,600
There was.

12
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,600
But I took care of it.

13
00:02:53,133 --> 00:02:55,300
{\an8}APPLIED : 1 PERSON

14
00:02:58,033 --> 00:03:00,367
A GHOST ON THE SUBWAY

15
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,367
<i>It is said that eight million people</i>

16
00:03:04,433 --> 00:03:07,800
<i>out of ten million living in Seoun
go underground</i>

17
00:03:07,867 --> 00:03:09,100
<i>at least once a day.</i>

18
00:03:12,533 --> 00:03:15,533
<i>It is because of Seoun's metro system,</i>

19
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,367
<i>which is the third largest in the world
with 15 routes and 300 stations.</i>

20
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:21,867
<i>But because so many people
take the subway,</i>

21
00:03:21,934 --> 00:03:25,367
<i>there are many criminals
targeting subway passengers.</i>

22
00:03:26,834 --> 00:03:30,633
Did you know
that we have separate police officers

23
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,934
protecting the underground?

24
00:03:32,567 --> 00:03:36,600
The Subway Police is

25
00:03:36,667 --> 00:03:39,300
celebrating the 30th anniversary
of its foundation.

26
00:04:20,633 --> 00:04:21,467
{\an8}Salute.

27
00:04:21,533 --> 00:04:23,533
{\an8}SUBWAY POLICE

28
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,467
At ease.

29
00:04:36,834 --> 00:04:38,700
The Subway Police is

30
00:04:39,266 --> 00:04:43,166
made up of 4 investigation teams
and 24 patrol teams.

31
00:04:43,667 --> 00:04:47,767
They arrest about 50 criminals per day.

32
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:53,567
We will show you their competence today.

33
00:04:53,633 --> 00:04:54,667
Captain Ko.

34
00:04:56,633 --> 00:04:59,967
Captain Ko of Wangsuri Subway Police

35
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,166
will demonstrate
how to arrest pickpockets today.

36
00:05:02,967 --> 00:05:04,100
Please look forward to it.

37
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,834
Thank you for coming.

38
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,200
Please write good articles for us.
Thank you.

39
00:05:16,667 --> 00:05:17,834
Captain Ko.

40
00:05:23,567 --> 00:05:24,667
SUBWAY POLICE DETECTIVE

41
00:05:50,734 --> 00:05:52,166
That really hurts.

42
00:06:09,967 --> 00:06:10,800
Stand straight.

43
00:06:17,433 --> 00:06:20,066
As you can see,

44
00:06:20,133 --> 00:06:23,333
thanks to the officers
of the Subway Police,

45
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,166
my wallet is safely in...

46
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,266
My wallet.

47
00:06:34,467 --> 00:06:35,400
Locust?

48
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,400
Locust?

49
00:06:39,367 --> 00:06:40,700
My wallet is gone, too.

50
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:42,333
Mine is gone, too.

51
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,633
-What?
-Everybody! Please stay still.

52
00:06:55,533 --> 00:06:57,100
Right. Turn off the cameras.

53
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,567
Turn off the cameras, please.

54
00:06:58,767 --> 00:07:00,133
IS SEOUN SUBWAY SAFE?

55
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,300
{\an8}One moment, please.

56
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,633
Captain Ko. Stop the train!

57
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:13,600
You see...

58
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:18,100
Ma'am, if one uses the emergency brake
without a good reason,

59
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:20,233
they could be imprisoned
for up to two years or...

60
00:07:21,133 --> 00:07:23,300
-Captain Ko.
-Yes, ma'am.

61
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,300
Move.

62
00:07:27,233 --> 00:07:28,400
EMERGENCY BRAKE

63
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,734
I'll stop the train! One, two, three!

64
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:48,867
Everybody, listen up.

65
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,633
I definitely had my wallet
when I got on the subway.

66
00:07:54,567 --> 00:07:57,300
No one has gotten off
or gotten on since then,

67
00:07:58,667 --> 00:08:02,567
so the culprit is definitely here.

68
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,967
This is no longer a pretend.

69
00:08:07,033 --> 00:08:09,000
This is going to be
an actual investigation.

70
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,834
Search them, Captain Ko.

71
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,200
I'm Captain Ko Ji-seok
of the Subway Police.

72
00:08:17,667 --> 00:08:18,633
I need to search you.

73
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:22,600
I'm a victim, too.
Why are you searching my purse?

74
00:08:22,667 --> 00:08:23,767
Excuse me.

75
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:29,500
Where is the key?

76
00:08:30,767 --> 00:08:32,200
I'm sorry, let me check your purse.

77
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,767
What's this?

78
00:09:03,467 --> 00:09:04,300
What?

79
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:10,767
Excuse me. Could you please stand up?

80
00:09:10,834 --> 00:09:12,300
-What?
-Please excuse me.

81
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,333
Please excuse me.

82
00:09:48,066 --> 00:09:49,934
SUBWAY SERIAL MURDER
FOURTH VICTIM FOUND

83
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,100
THE POLICE HELD A FESTIVAL
BEFORE A CORPSE

84
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:52,633
THE POLICE ARE BEYOND INCOMPETENT

85
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,700
TRENDING : SUBWAY SERIAL MURDER

86
00:10:02,834 --> 00:10:07,834
{\an8}SUBWAY SERIAL MURDER
FOURTH VICTIM FOUND

87
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,500
We found another victim
of the subway serial murder case.

88
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,166
I will take full responsibility

89
00:10:19,533 --> 00:10:22,166
and step down from my post
as the commissioner.

90
00:10:26,934 --> 00:10:29,734
But not now.

91
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,200
Give me three months.

92
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,100
I will catch the killer.

93
00:10:35,066 --> 00:10:37,066
Not only will I catch the serial killer,

94
00:10:37,133 --> 00:10:40,900
but I will also catch the pickpocket group
that mocked the police.

95
00:10:42,133 --> 00:10:43,467
Just three months.

96
00:10:45,033 --> 00:10:47,200
If I fail to keep this promise,

97
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,166
I will resign then.

98
00:10:53,233 --> 00:10:54,867
Have you identified the suspect?

99
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,467
Are you sure you can
catch the killer in three months?

100
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,533
I'm sorry. I did check
under the seats last night, but...

101
00:11:05,033 --> 00:11:06,266
Why? It's amusing.

102
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:08,300
What?

103
00:11:10,066 --> 00:11:12,166
The police invited the reporters

104
00:11:12,233 --> 00:11:14,900
to the subway with a corpse inside.

105
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:18,467
Chief Ha Ma-ri
of Regional Investigation Unit.

106
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,667
You heard it, right?

107
00:11:20,734 --> 00:11:22,600
-We have three months.
-Yes.

108
00:11:22,667 --> 00:11:26,033
You couldn't resolve it
for the past two years.

109
00:11:26,266 --> 00:11:28,266
If you can't do it,
we'll form a new special unit.

110
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:31,333
This isn't the only case
I worked on in the past two years.

111
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,200
Hwangseo-dong kidnapping and murder,
serial murder in Namcheon,

112
00:11:33,266 --> 00:11:35,767
and Mukil-dong serial murder...
I solved them all.

113
00:11:35,834 --> 00:11:39,133
So you can solve
the subway serial murder case

114
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,800
if that's the only case to work on?

115
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:42,133
Yes, I am confident.

116
00:11:43,767 --> 00:11:44,700
Fine.

117
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:48,934
Regional Investigation Unit One.
Focus only on this case now.

118
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,033
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

119
00:11:51,734 --> 00:11:53,000
Don't just stand there.

120
00:11:53,066 --> 00:11:56,100
Go arrest the locusts
and get my wallet back.

121
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:57,200
Yes, ma'am.

122
00:11:57,633 --> 00:12:00,667
Report to me
about the investigations directly.

123
00:12:00,734 --> 00:12:01,567
Yes, ma'am.

124
00:12:01,967 --> 00:12:02,967
It's so hot in here.

125
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:10,734
Ma-ri.

126
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,333
Since I'm with the Subway Police,

127
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:16,633
I will work with you by giving you

128
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,800
all the data you need.

129
00:12:19,033 --> 00:12:20,867
You'll cooperate, not work with me.

130
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,000
And only when I ask for it.

131
00:12:30,533 --> 00:12:33,266
I will now brief you
about the subway serial murder case.

132
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:35,500
A total of three people were
kidnapped and murdered

133
00:12:35,567 --> 00:12:37,667
at the subway stations
in the past two years.

134
00:12:37,734 --> 00:12:41,233
And today, we found the fourth victim.

135
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,567
They pickpocket everyone
on a single train,

136
00:12:44,633 --> 00:12:47,133
so the media started to call them
the Locust Swarm.

137
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,100
Because of the nickname,

138
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:51,767
they started to make cuts
in the shape of a locust's hind leg.

139
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:54,400
The security cameras captured the victims

140
00:12:54,467 --> 00:12:56,467
getting off the subway,

141
00:12:56,533 --> 00:12:59,500
but there were no records of them
going through the turnstile.

142
00:13:00,567 --> 00:13:01,867
So the victims disappeared

143
00:13:02,266 --> 00:13:05,567
somewhere between the platform
and the turnstile.

144
00:13:05,633 --> 00:13:07,900
The culprit kidnapped, murdered,
and abandoned the victims

145
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,900
in public places
where many people walk by,

146
00:13:09,967 --> 00:13:12,433
but no one has seen the killer.

147
00:13:13,433 --> 00:13:14,900
That is why the media gave him

148
00:13:15,767 --> 00:13:18,333
the nickname of the Subway Ghost.

149
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,600
We can't go through thousands
of fingerprints and footprints,

150
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:23,533
and the security cameras
are useless in crowded areas.

151
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,166
So our strategy is to...

152
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,734
FIRST TRAIN, LAST TRAIN

153
00:13:37,533 --> 00:13:40,400
We'll ride the subway
from the first train to the last one.

154
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,834
THE SEA EAGLE BROTHERS

155
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,600
<i>I'm going undercover on the last train.</i>

156
00:14:05,667 --> 00:14:07,667
<i>Line Two, Wangsuri Station,
Carriage Three.</i>

157
00:14:07,734 --> 00:14:08,633
<i>There's a drunk woman here.</i>

158
00:14:22,967 --> 00:14:25,033
She shouldn't be sleeping here like this.

159
00:14:25,867 --> 00:14:27,266
<i>A pickpocket is here.</i>

160
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:28,834
Are you all right?

161
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:32,967
She's not okay.

162
00:14:48,934 --> 00:14:49,967
<i>Locust.</i>

163
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,633
This is my jurisdiction.

164
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,934
-Are you with him?
-What?

165
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Hey, you're mistaken.

166
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,033
Wait. Do you know who I am?

167
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,266
-Let me go.
-Hey!

168
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:21,533
Hey, uncuff me!

169
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,500
Just do one lap. I'll come back for you.

170
00:15:23,567 --> 00:15:24,400
Hey!

171
00:15:24,467 --> 00:15:27,133
<i>Stand clear of the closing doors.</i>

172
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,467
Hey, this is the last train!

173
00:15:31,066 --> 00:15:31,900
What?

174
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,533
So everything,
including the gold necklace, was bait?

175
00:16:13,834 --> 00:16:15,834
<i>There's a 100-meter hallway
around that corner.</i>

176
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,600
<i>At the end of that is an escalator.</i>

177
00:16:17,667 --> 00:16:20,000
<i>Then there are 12 steps,
and then there are stores.</i>

178
00:16:20,066 --> 00:16:23,200
{\an8}<i>The stores are lined up
for about 500 meters, and there's Exit 2.</i>

179
00:16:27,934 --> 00:16:30,000
<i>I can't catch him
in the 500-meter hallway.</i>

180
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,600
<i>I'll get him
in front of the line of stores.</i>

181
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,500
<i>I'm currently at the main stairway
of Wangsuri Station.</i>

182
00:16:54,567 --> 00:16:56,333
<i>There are 22 steps,
and there's a 50-meter hallway.</i>

183
00:16:56,567 --> 00:16:57,633
<i>There are stairs
at the end of the hallway.</i>

184
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,433
<i>If he goes up the stairs,
it'll be Exit Six.</i>

185
00:16:59,867 --> 00:17:00,867
<i>Then what should I do?</i>

186
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,166
{\an8}<i>I must go out through Exit Three.</i>

187
00:17:03,233 --> 00:17:05,233
<i>I go across the intersection,
and there will be Exit Six.</i>

188
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:33,200
Are you a ghost?

189
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,133
No.

190
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:39,266
Yoo Ryeong.

191
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,200
The victim got off here and disappeared.

192
00:17:52,667 --> 00:17:54,734
Ask Ko Ji-seok
for the security camera footage.

193
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:58,066
You know that this isn't
Ji-seok's fault, right?

194
00:17:59,233 --> 00:18:00,300
I don't care.

195
00:18:02,033 --> 00:18:03,367
You do seem to care.

196
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:20,734
I got it.

197
00:18:34,467 --> 00:18:35,967
I got it.

198
00:18:48,633 --> 00:18:49,800
Is anybody there?

199
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:15,867
<i>The doors are opening.</i>

200
00:19:22,834 --> 00:19:24,834
-Ko Ji-seok.
-Mr. Ko.

201
00:19:52,734 --> 00:19:54,200
Hey, about that thing...

202
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,333
Let's clean up here.
It's time for the interview.

203
00:19:59,233 --> 00:20:00,066
Oh, right.

204
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,533
You said once you find a partner,
you'll be nice to them.

205
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,500
Yes. After spending a month
without a partner,

206
00:20:06,567 --> 00:20:08,300
I've realized that I need one
more than I need a girlfriend.

207
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,033
I even ordered the most expensive
matching police batons.

208
00:20:16,567 --> 00:20:17,400
Captain...

209
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,500
Is Captain Ko Ji-seok here?

210
00:20:27,567 --> 00:20:28,934
Yes, I'm Ko Ji-seok...

211
00:20:40,633 --> 00:20:42,367
I'm Shinmok Patrol Station's
Officer Yoo Ryeong.

212
00:20:42,433 --> 00:20:43,767
I'm here for the interview.

213
00:20:45,567 --> 00:20:46,734
She's a woman.

214
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,633
She's in.

215
00:20:49,066 --> 00:20:50,967
Who is this?

216
00:20:52,033 --> 00:20:53,100
He's a locust.

217
00:20:54,767 --> 00:20:55,600
A locust?

218
00:20:55,667 --> 00:20:59,200
I lack experience,
so I wanted to show you my skills.

219
00:20:59,266 --> 00:21:01,467
It's a type of bribery
to ask you to hire me.

220
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:04,600
He's a locust?

221
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,700
Here's the proof.

222
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:09,800
It's true.

223
00:21:10,433 --> 00:21:11,967
Captain, a locust...

224
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,934
-Is he over there?
-Yes.

225
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,066
Hello, Captain.

226
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,567
Are you unwell, Captain?

227
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,200
What's wrong, Captain?

228
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,533
Go.

229
00:21:31,867 --> 00:21:32,700
What?

230
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,233
Go away.

231
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,133
<i>This is my jurisdiction.</i>

232
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,767
Do you know who I am?

233
00:21:44,233 --> 00:21:45,333
The handcuff last night...

234
00:21:48,266 --> 00:21:49,166
Captain.

235
00:21:49,533 --> 00:21:52,000
Captain, are you all right?

236
00:21:52,066 --> 00:21:54,600
I see what happened here.
The bad connection was the issue.

237
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:02,133
Forget it. Let's start the interview now.

238
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,400
When will we start?

239
00:22:15,433 --> 00:22:17,233
-Go get the printed paper.
-Yes, sir.

240
00:22:24,233 --> 00:22:25,300
REASONS FOR DISQUALIFICATION

241
00:22:25,367 --> 00:22:27,300
Reasons for disqualification?

242
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,333
"Making arrests without approval
in another jurisdiction."

243
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,633
"Violation of Article Six of the
Judicial Police Officers Regulations."

244
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,533
"Handcuffing an innocent person."

245
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,734
"Violation of Act on the Performance
of Duties by Police Officers."

246
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,934
"Leaving handcuffs on long-term.
Violation of Human Rights Laws."

247
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,266
"Bribery to the HR team. Violation
of Improper Solicitation and Graft Act."

248
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,467
Can't you just punch me once

249
00:22:49,533 --> 00:22:50,900
and forget the whole thing?

250
00:22:52,066 --> 00:22:54,166
I handcuffed you
because I didn't know who you were,

251
00:22:54,233 --> 00:22:56,433
and I caught a bad guy.
You can't call that bribery.

252
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,967
You said yourself earlier
that it was a type of bribery.

253
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,900
I know you feel uncomfortable
because of last night...

254
00:23:01,967 --> 00:23:04,133
Yes, I do feel uncomfortable
and embarrassed

255
00:23:04,767 --> 00:23:07,066
to work with a rookie who handcuffed me.

256
00:23:07,734 --> 00:23:10,567
But that is not the only reason.

257
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:13,767
You're too much.

258
00:23:13,834 --> 00:23:16,800
You disguised as a drunk woman
to catch a pickpocket

259
00:23:16,867 --> 00:23:18,467
and become one of us.

260
00:23:18,533 --> 00:23:20,166
That actually scares me.

261
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,467
Is there an ulterior reason why
you want to join?

262
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:26,734
Your eyes.

263
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,133
They look suspicious.

264
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,467
Start talking.

265
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,433
-I don't have an ulterior reason.
-I knew it.

266
00:23:37,233 --> 00:23:38,300
You're hiding something.

267
00:23:39,266 --> 00:23:41,333
It's not like you can create
a slush fund here.

268
00:23:42,734 --> 00:23:43,900
Why on earth are you here?

269
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:47,133
If you don't tell me, I'll look into it.

270
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,667
SL.

271
00:23:59,867 --> 00:24:01,767
It means Subway Lovers.

272
00:24:01,834 --> 00:24:04,867
I'm the group's Seoun branch manager.

273
00:24:05,233 --> 00:24:06,066
What?

274
00:24:06,133 --> 00:24:08,200
Everyone has one thing that they love.

275
00:24:08,266 --> 00:24:10,233
To me, that's the subway.

276
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,667
The thrill I get when the subway

277
00:24:12,734 --> 00:24:14,867
travels 110 km per hour underground.

278
00:24:15,834 --> 00:24:19,600
How great would it be if I could
feel that at work every day?

279
00:24:21,867 --> 00:24:22,934
Is she a pervert?

280
00:24:24,834 --> 00:24:28,266
Enjoy your hobby on your days off.

281
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:30,533
You can ride it all day

282
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,800
from Incheon to Chuncheon.

283
00:24:33,867 --> 00:24:36,867
I have memorized
every route of the Seoun Metro.

284
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:39,800
Please use my ability to catch perverts.

285
00:24:39,867 --> 00:24:41,400
I'll just use that big map instead.

286
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:42,967
Captain Ko.

287
00:24:43,734 --> 00:24:44,667
Captain Ko.

288
00:24:45,266 --> 00:24:46,166
Please.

289
00:24:46,633 --> 00:24:48,800
A small hole can sink a ship.

290
00:24:50,367 --> 00:24:51,200
A hole?

291
00:24:51,266 --> 00:24:52,867
The rules you violated...

292
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:56,233
You might think they are trivial,

293
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,734
but they can sink

294
00:24:58,467 --> 00:25:00,567
not only you but also the entire team.

295
00:25:07,867 --> 00:25:09,000
I'm going undercover.

296
00:25:09,066 --> 00:25:12,233
What? You're not going with your partner?

297
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,100
She is not the right fit.

298
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,467
He's not a locust.

299
00:25:18,133 --> 00:25:19,100
What?

300
00:25:19,166 --> 00:25:20,867
He just got out of jail yesterday.

301
00:25:21,467 --> 00:25:23,700
Why would you copy the Locust Swarm?

302
00:25:23,767 --> 00:25:24,800
They're awesome.

303
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:28,100
They stole from the cops
and the commissioner.

304
00:25:28,166 --> 00:25:29,800
Watch your mouth.

305
00:25:29,867 --> 00:25:32,133
It isn't easy to catch the locusts.

306
00:25:33,066 --> 00:25:35,567
Always stay alert when you go undercover.

307
00:25:35,633 --> 00:25:37,066
I'll get going now.

308
00:25:37,133 --> 00:25:38,200
-Okay.
-Bye.

309
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,734
If you order spicy tripe,
you'll get rolled eggs for free.

310
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,400
Free.

311
00:26:26,433 --> 00:26:27,600
Sir.

312
00:26:27,667 --> 00:26:29,900
Come on. This is my jurisdiction.
It's not my first...

313
00:26:30,433 --> 00:26:32,000
I'm working undercover.

314
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:38,066
A police officer is stealing my job.

315
00:26:38,133 --> 00:26:41,533
All right. Come on.
Why would you yell like that?

316
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,600
Come eat rolled eggs.

317
00:26:44,667 --> 00:26:45,900
Rolled eggs. Spicy tripe.

318
00:26:45,967 --> 00:26:47,800
Spicy tripe. Rolled eggs.

319
00:26:47,867 --> 00:26:50,433
If you order spicy tripe,
you'll get rolled eggs for free.

320
00:26:50,667 --> 00:26:52,700
Come eat rolled eggs.

321
00:26:52,767 --> 00:26:57,166
Come eat spicy tripe.

322
00:26:57,233 --> 00:27:00,200
We'll give you free rolled eggs
if you order spicy tripe.

323
00:27:03,233 --> 00:27:04,400
That bastard.

324
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,367
If you order spicy tripe,
you'll get rolled eggs for free.

325
00:27:28,834 --> 00:27:29,734
Excuse me.

326
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,300
Thank you. Free rolled eggs.

327
00:27:35,367 --> 00:27:37,834
If you order spicy tripe,
you'll get rolled eggs for free.

328
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,600
If you order spicy tripe, you'll get...

329
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,300
If you order spicy tripe,
you'll get rolled eggs for free.

330
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,667
I'm Captain Ko Ji-seok
of the Subway Police.

331
00:27:59,266 --> 00:28:00,533
Please take off your shoe.

332
00:28:11,867 --> 00:28:12,900
How original.

333
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:16,033
As of 9:30 a.m., you are under arrest.

334
00:28:16,433 --> 00:28:20,000
You have the right to an attorney
and have the right to explain yourself.

335
00:28:20,066 --> 00:28:21,367
But you don't have proof.

336
00:28:21,934 --> 00:28:22,834
Proof...

337
00:28:24,567 --> 00:28:27,233
We carry these things now, all right?

338
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,700
Look.

339
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,233
The proof is...

340
00:28:32,834 --> 00:28:34,300
FILES NOT FOUND

341
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,667
Where did you send the files?

342
00:28:39,767 --> 00:28:41,567
You can't arrest me without proof, right?

343
00:28:52,667 --> 00:28:53,500
Give it to me.

344
00:28:54,467 --> 00:28:55,567
File.

345
00:28:57,467 --> 00:28:59,967
The police officer looks good in pictures.

346
00:29:00,867 --> 00:29:01,800
<i>Isn't she a cop?</i>

347
00:29:01,867 --> 00:29:03,667
<i>How original. I've never seen a cop here.</i>

348
00:29:03,734 --> 00:29:05,100
<i>This just brightened up my day.</i>

349
00:29:05,166 --> 00:29:06,967
<i>I respect your craftsmanship.</i>

350
00:29:07,033 --> 00:29:08,433
<i>Gosh, that is awesome.</i>

351
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,600
<i>Can't you upload more?</i>

352
00:29:09,667 --> 00:29:11,066
<i>Her legs are more beautiful
than my wife's.</i>

353
00:29:11,133 --> 00:29:12,800
<i>This is definitely worth
showing my friends.</i>

354
00:29:12,867 --> 00:29:13,867
<i>Mr. Shoe Man. I'm impressed.</i>

355
00:29:13,934 --> 00:29:15,033
<i>I've never felt this way before.</i>

356
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:15,967
<i>Please invite me.</i>

357
00:29:16,033 --> 00:29:18,066
Whom should we invite first?

358
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:22,233
<i>Show me the faces first. Then I'll decide.</i>

359
00:29:22,767 --> 00:29:26,333
Here are the faces.

360
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,633
{\an8}COP VS RED SKIRT WOMAN

361
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:30,734
<i>Go away, cop.</i>

362
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,567
<i>The cop is no match
for the red skirt woman.</i>

363
00:29:33,633 --> 00:29:34,834
<i>I don't really like the cop.</i>

364
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,934
<i>The red skirt woman is a goddess.</i>

365
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,533
{\an8}<i>The cop stands no chance.</i>

366
00:29:39,633 --> 00:29:43,166
{\an8}Time for the cop to go.

367
00:29:55,934 --> 00:29:57,133
Be quiet.

368
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,133
Get out of my way.

369
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,400
-I can't go because of you.
-That car is the problem.

370
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:04,033
Come on. Why don't you move first?

371
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,000
CAPTAIN KO JI-SEOK

372
00:30:06,633 --> 00:30:07,667
Petty jerk.

373
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,500
Yes, Captain?

374
00:30:14,033 --> 00:30:15,367
<i>Hello, Ms. Victim.</i>

375
00:30:16,133 --> 00:30:16,967
What?

376
00:30:17,033 --> 00:30:19,500
<i>Please file a report.</i>

377
00:30:20,166 --> 00:30:21,066
A report?

378
00:30:28,867 --> 00:30:31,266
You must file a report
for me to catch the guy.

379
00:30:31,333 --> 00:30:34,433
A police officer can report as a victim

380
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,967
for a spy camera crime. Fine.

381
00:30:36,433 --> 00:30:39,200
But you want me to find the pictures?

382
00:30:39,266 --> 00:30:42,066
You know I can't get a warrant
without proof.

383
00:30:43,133 --> 00:30:45,300
I don't think he'll keep
the pictures to himself.

384
00:30:45,867 --> 00:30:47,934
I'm sure he's going
to release them everywhere

385
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,166
for many people to see.

386
00:30:49,767 --> 00:30:52,200
Particularly, in that world,
police uniforms are...

387
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,867
All right.

388
00:30:59,066 --> 00:31:00,200
Unbelievable.

389
00:31:22,633 --> 00:31:24,667
I'm going to kill him.

390
00:31:25,033 --> 00:31:26,867
I'll delete them
once the investigation's over.

391
00:31:26,934 --> 00:31:28,734
There's a spy camera folder, so...

392
00:31:29,767 --> 00:31:30,633
Don't look.

393
00:31:31,433 --> 00:31:33,533
I won't. I promise.

394
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:37,033
Just save the pictures in that folder.

395
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,433
-Save them?
-I won't look at them. I promise.

396
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,934
I'm not looking, even now.

397
00:31:51,033 --> 00:31:54,266
Captain. Take a look at this.

398
00:31:54,333 --> 00:31:55,433
You told me not to.

399
00:31:55,734 --> 00:31:57,166
Not me. I'm talking about her.

400
00:32:05,967 --> 00:32:07,767
SUBWAY SPY CAMERA
WE INVITE YOU

401
00:32:07,834 --> 00:32:09,400
WE WILL BRING THIS WOMAN WITH US

402
00:32:09,467 --> 00:32:11,600
Men are already lining up.

403
00:32:13,133 --> 00:32:15,066
The location of the party

404
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:20,200
will only be revealed to the ones
who are selected.

405
00:32:21,133 --> 00:32:22,166
Invitation announcement?

406
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,633
That means that they will
knock out the woman

407
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,467
and invite men to rape her, right?

408
00:32:30,367 --> 00:32:32,533
It's the same ID as the man
who posted my pictures.

409
00:32:34,467 --> 00:32:35,333
Let's go.

410
00:32:35,967 --> 00:32:37,767
Let's go ruin this crazy party.

411
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,133
We don't take on violent crime cases.

412
00:32:40,967 --> 00:32:41,800
What?

413
00:32:41,867 --> 00:32:43,767
We have another task.
Arresting the Locust Swarm.

414
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,266
This is
the Cyber Investigation Team, right?

415
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:48,934
There is an invitation announcement.

416
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,600
<i>We're too busy to deal with
petty pranks like that.</i>

417
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,266
This is the Violent Crimes Team, right?

418
00:32:57,333 --> 00:32:59,400
There is
an invitation announcement for tomorrow.

419
00:32:59,467 --> 00:33:01,033
<i>No one has gotten hurt yet, right?</i>

420
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,500
<i>Call us again when someone gets hurt.</i>

421
00:33:03,567 --> 00:33:05,533
Wouldn't it be too late

422
00:33:07,133 --> 00:33:09,633
if we wait until someone gets hurt?

423
00:33:11,133 --> 00:33:12,567
When's the party?

424
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,934
Let's see.

425
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,233
Whom should I call?

426
00:33:32,633 --> 00:33:33,533
FIREARM STORAGE

427
00:33:46,033 --> 00:33:47,033
That isn't mine, is it?

428
00:33:48,767 --> 00:33:50,567
Let me borrow it for a little bit.

429
00:33:50,633 --> 00:33:53,233
As the Seoun branch manager of SL,
I can't just sit back and watch.

430
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,633
What?

431
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,633
What?

432
00:34:05,934 --> 00:34:07,133
Give me my gun back!

433
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,467
You aren't supposed to actually use it.

434
00:34:09,533 --> 00:34:11,867
That was given to us just as a formality.

435
00:34:11,934 --> 00:34:14,533
I'm only taking it as a formality, too.

436
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,700
All right.

437
00:34:15,767 --> 00:34:18,800
We'll take the case, so give me back...

438
00:34:20,967 --> 00:34:23,000
Ms. SL, please go home...

439
00:34:29,934 --> 00:34:31,867
Do you even know where they are?

440
00:34:32,867 --> 00:34:35,633
Please look into it.
The Cyber Investigation Team should know.

441
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,133
Slow down. You're over the speed limit.

442
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,900
There's no time.

443
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:03,600
Hey! It's a red light!

444
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,767
You went over the stop line. Reverse.

445
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,667
Reverse.

446
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:14,133
Why don't you just ride the patrol car?

447
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,200
We don't have one, remember?
We take the subway.

448
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,133
Sorry.

449
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,700
Slow down, will you?

450
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,567
Don't you know motorcycles are supposed to
keep the lanes, too?

451
00:35:39,367 --> 00:35:41,133
Do you not?

452
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,333
I do know.

453
00:36:18,533 --> 00:36:19,367
Put it on.

454
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,533
-Captain Ko.
-Just put it on.

455
00:36:25,734 --> 00:36:27,467
Give me your shirt instead.

456
00:36:30,867 --> 00:36:31,867
What do you want?

457
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,900
We're looking for spy camera suspects.
Please cooperate.

458
00:36:40,967 --> 00:36:43,967
There were two customers here,
but they just left.

459
00:36:49,633 --> 00:36:51,500
Damn it. No.

460
00:36:52,667 --> 00:36:53,834
Those bastards.

461
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,133
Damn it.

462
00:37:09,166 --> 00:37:11,000
That crazy woman.

463
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,767
Wait!

464
00:37:16,767 --> 00:37:18,233
Hurry up, will you?

465
00:37:36,433 --> 00:37:39,266
Let's go get ready for the party.

466
00:37:46,533 --> 00:37:47,567
Be careful.

467
00:38:06,066 --> 00:38:06,900
Sir.

468
00:38:07,633 --> 00:38:09,100
We could've gotten in an accident.

469
00:38:10,133 --> 00:38:11,867
This is a one-way street.

470
00:38:18,467 --> 00:38:22,100
Hey! Why are you going this way?

471
00:38:35,467 --> 00:38:36,734
Watch out! There are people!

472
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:44,333
Have you gone mad?
Do you even know where you're going?

473
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:50,934
{\an8}ONE-WAY STREET

474
00:39:08,266 --> 00:39:09,100
Captain.

475
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,667
Captain!

476
00:39:11,834 --> 00:39:12,667
What?

477
00:39:16,266 --> 00:39:17,467
Bring the scooter with you.

478
00:39:28,266 --> 00:39:30,033
-Darn it.
-Who's that?

479
00:39:30,967 --> 00:39:32,100
Is that the cop from earlier?

480
00:39:34,533 --> 00:39:35,500
What?

481
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,700
Get out of the car.

482
00:39:45,033 --> 00:39:45,967
Those bastards.

483
00:39:59,533 --> 00:40:00,500
Finally.

484
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,767
Where did they go?

485
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:42,567
You jumped off the second floor

486
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:46,166
and went down the stairs on the scooter.

487
00:40:46,233 --> 00:40:48,066
You don't want to live to see another day?

488
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,467
Don't worry. I won't die.

489
00:40:55,533 --> 00:40:56,734
That's not the problem.

490
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:59,467
The amount of fine you have to pay is...

491
00:40:59,533 --> 00:41:02,700
One can make some mistakes
while catching culprits.

492
00:41:03,333 --> 00:41:04,633
It's better than having regrets.

493
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:07,300
I'm doing the regretting now.

494
00:41:08,734 --> 00:41:11,900
We'll do this my way now.
If you're not in, let's split up.

495
00:41:14,967 --> 00:41:16,633
You scared me.

496
00:41:20,066 --> 00:41:22,800
That's the cop
we took pictures of earlier, right?

497
00:41:22,867 --> 00:41:25,900
No wonder she was so desperate to get us.

498
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:28,200
She's a piece of work.

499
00:41:30,633 --> 00:41:34,667
I'll sedate the woman
when she's in a crowded subway station.

500
00:41:35,233 --> 00:41:38,200
You wait for us by the exit and get her.

501
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:41,934
Do you know which station
she gets off at when she goes to work?

502
00:41:42,567 --> 00:41:44,333
Don't worry about a thing.

503
00:41:45,233 --> 00:41:48,100
Our members will help us out.

504
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,000
<i>Here's her SNS account.</i>

505
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,200
{\an8}<i>I got her number.</i>

506
00:41:53,266 --> 00:41:55,633
{\an8}<i>It's 010-177-2289.</i>

507
00:41:56,033 --> 00:41:58,900
{\an8}<i>I just texted her to root for her.</i>

508
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,700
{\an8}<i>I'll send you some underwear.</i>

509
00:42:06,767 --> 00:42:09,700
{\an8}<i>You live in Unit 201, Handeul Mansion,
Sindang-dong, right?</i>

510
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,066
<i>If you report us to the police,</i>

511
00:42:26,934 --> 00:42:28,233
<i>we'll pay you a visit.</i>

512
00:42:30,467 --> 00:42:32,333
Her identity must have been
revealed by now.

513
00:42:34,867 --> 00:42:36,700
It was just here.

514
00:42:36,767 --> 00:42:38,200
{\an8}THIS WEBSITE HAS BEEN SHUT DOWN

515
00:42:38,266 --> 00:42:40,934
{\an8}They do this so they don't get caught.

516
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,500
They always close the website
and open up a new one.

517
00:42:44,867 --> 00:42:47,266
{\an8}<i>Code zero. The Eagle Brothers, move.</i>

518
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,133
Where's the key?

519
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:01,066
I'm sure the owner has it.

520
00:43:02,367 --> 00:43:05,333
I was in a hurry, so I borrowed it.
I found it parked by the station.

521
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,900
This was stolen?

522
00:43:06,967 --> 00:43:08,400
This is not how I do things.

523
00:43:09,667 --> 00:43:11,600
There. Hop on.

524
00:43:15,667 --> 00:43:16,867
Let's go.

525
00:43:22,233 --> 00:43:25,233
Are we finally getting involved
in a violent crime case now?

526
00:43:26,133 --> 00:43:27,400
Why would we?

527
00:43:27,467 --> 00:43:29,667
We're sure they will
take her on her way to work.

528
00:43:29,734 --> 00:43:33,066
But we don't know if they'll take her
where she gets on or off the train.

529
00:43:33,567 --> 00:43:36,033
Then we'll have to split up
and guard both stations.

530
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,066
Let's look at
the security camera footage first.

531
00:43:39,133 --> 00:43:42,567
We just need to check the time
she passed the turnstile and look through

532
00:43:42,633 --> 00:43:44,266
the travel card log of that time.

533
00:43:44,333 --> 00:43:46,600
Call and wake up
the Metro Corporation employee

534
00:43:46,667 --> 00:43:48,400
-and ask to sign off on the request.
-Okay.

535
00:43:48,467 --> 00:43:49,400
"The request"?

536
00:43:49,467 --> 00:43:51,900
We need to file
an official request to look at

537
00:43:51,967 --> 00:43:54,266
the security camera footage
and the turnstile records.

538
00:43:54,333 --> 00:43:55,667
There's someone on duty
at the station office.

539
00:43:55,734 --> 00:43:57,467
Let's ask him. We're in a hurry.

540
00:43:57,533 --> 00:44:00,333
We should follow the protocol.
Let's get an approval first.

541
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,467
We need an approval to save a person?

542
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,533
What now?

543
00:44:11,333 --> 00:44:12,767
What?

544
00:44:12,834 --> 00:44:14,734
-What are you going to do with it?
-What?

545
00:44:15,367 --> 00:44:16,767
Are you going to threaten them?

546
00:44:16,834 --> 00:44:18,333
If you hold a weapon,
that's special intimidation.

547
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,667
If you're a police officer,
you will be imprisoned...

548
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,033
Jeez.

549
00:44:24,967 --> 00:44:25,800
Hey!

550
00:44:25,867 --> 00:44:26,800
-Hey.
-Captain!

551
00:44:27,633 --> 00:44:30,667
STATION OFFICE

552
00:44:32,367 --> 00:44:33,500
That's trespassing.

553
00:44:39,967 --> 00:44:42,400
This is what I meant by the hole
that will sink the ship.

554
00:44:42,467 --> 00:44:43,934
You are the hole.

555
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,567
So are Violent Crimes
and Cyber Investigation.

556
00:44:45,633 --> 00:44:47,533
I'm trying to plug that hole.

557
00:44:51,767 --> 00:44:52,600
Move.

558
00:44:58,533 --> 00:44:59,367
Hurry.

559
00:45:19,767 --> 00:45:22,066
She got on at 7:28:36 a.m.

560
00:45:22,834 --> 00:45:23,967
This is where she got on.

561
00:45:24,467 --> 00:45:27,066
The single ticket shows that she got off

562
00:45:28,367 --> 00:45:29,567
at Oksu Station at 8:02 a.m.

563
00:45:31,033 --> 00:45:31,900
What?

564
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:35,200
-Why won't this open?
-Captain.

565
00:45:35,266 --> 00:45:36,266
Is it broken?

566
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:39,033
I'll go to Oksu Station.
You and Su-ho guard this station.

567
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:40,867
Ms. SL, you may go home...

568
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:42,800
Why won't this open? Goodness.

569
00:45:47,767 --> 00:45:49,667
-What about me?
-Quick.

570
00:45:49,734 --> 00:45:51,767
-What should I do?
-Come on.

571
00:45:51,834 --> 00:45:53,033
Why won't this open?

572
00:46:11,333 --> 00:46:13,700
This damn doorknob.

573
00:46:22,667 --> 00:46:24,100
OKSU STATION

574
00:46:24,867 --> 00:46:27,433
Let's see. This looks familiar.

575
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,266
It looks like a hat for some event.

576
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:31,533
An event?

577
00:46:33,934 --> 00:46:34,900
Oh, that place.

578
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,533
A perspective without prejudice
changes the world.

579
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:38,433
Please sign here.

580
00:46:38,533 --> 00:46:41,166
-This is for the handicapped.
-Please sign here.

581
00:46:41,233 --> 00:46:43,200
I'm Detective Ko Ji-seok
of the Subway Police.

582
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:46,467
Do you recognize her?

583
00:46:46,867 --> 00:46:49,467
Yes, she volunteered here yesterday.

584
00:46:49,533 --> 00:46:50,800
She doesn't work here?

585
00:46:50,867 --> 00:46:52,934
No, she was only here
for one day yesterday.

586
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,767
-Do you know her number?
-Well...

587
00:47:02,567 --> 00:47:04,567
Here you go.

588
00:47:31,934 --> 00:47:32,867
I'm sorry.

589
00:47:45,133 --> 00:47:47,433
Do you have any other information on her?

590
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,467
Maybe where she works?

591
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:51,633
She said she works somewhere near Gangbuk.

592
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:52,867
Gangbuk...

593
00:47:52,934 --> 00:47:54,533
I know her social media account.

594
00:48:00,834 --> 00:48:01,867
ON MY WAY TO WORK

595
00:48:01,934 --> 00:48:04,467
She goes to work at 7:30 a.m., not 8 a.m.

596
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,667
That means we only have 20 minutes left.

597
00:48:08,633 --> 00:48:10,066
Eight. That's the exit number.

598
00:48:10,567 --> 00:48:11,934
There's a coffee shop inside the station.

599
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,333
There's a mirror
between the coffee shop and the exit.

600
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:17,533
Thank you.

601
00:48:22,767 --> 00:48:24,300
Su-ho, how's it going over there?

602
00:48:24,367 --> 00:48:26,233
<i>We haven't seen her yet.</i>

603
00:48:26,533 --> 00:48:28,533
<i>Maybe we missed her
because it's too crowded here.</i>

604
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:29,900
All right. Keep looking.

605
00:48:32,834 --> 00:48:33,700
Ms. Yoo.

606
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,767
<i>The only stations near Gangbuk
that have an Exit Eight are</i>

607
00:48:43,367 --> 00:48:45,734
{\an8}<i>Suyu, Mia, Nowon, Gireum,
Hanlim, and Madeul.</i>

608
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:47,767
<i>Of those stations, the ones
with a coffee shop inside are</i>

609
00:48:47,834 --> 00:48:50,600
Nowon, Sinchon, Hanlim, Madeul,
Hapjeong, Myeongdong, and City Hall.

610
00:48:50,667 --> 00:48:51,600
How do you know that?

611
00:48:52,967 --> 00:48:56,433
The station that has a mirror
between the coffee shop and the exit is...

612
00:49:08,767 --> 00:49:13,867
EXIT 8

613
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:17,567
<i>Hanlim.</i>

614
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:24,333
Look who it is.

615
00:50:27,266 --> 00:50:29,100
Here. This way.

616
00:50:29,166 --> 00:50:30,033
Be careful.

617
00:50:33,066 --> 00:50:34,033
Careful.

618
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:39,133
There you go.

619
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:44,266
Hold on.

620
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:49,100
Where she took the picture
leads to two different exits.

621
00:50:49,767 --> 00:50:51,867
I'll stay here.
You go over to the other side.

622
00:50:51,934 --> 00:50:52,900
Okay.

623
00:50:58,767 --> 00:51:00,367
No. Stay still.

624
00:51:10,433 --> 00:51:11,367
Damn it.

625
00:51:17,333 --> 00:51:18,700
It's that cop again.

626
00:51:18,767 --> 00:51:19,867
Get her to sit up.

627
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:21,967
Get up.

628
00:51:22,033 --> 00:51:23,467
Sit up straight.

629
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,266
Police.

630
00:51:35,934 --> 00:51:37,367
Please roll down your window.

631
00:51:42,633 --> 00:51:44,433
Good morning, officer.
I'll move the car now.

632
00:51:46,033 --> 00:51:47,600
Hey, you!

633
00:51:48,567 --> 00:51:49,867
-Let go.
-Get out of the car.

634
00:51:49,934 --> 00:51:50,934
-Let go of me.
-Get off.

635
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,700
My arm!

636
00:51:52,767 --> 00:51:54,367
-My arm!
-Let go of me.

637
00:51:54,433 --> 00:51:56,200
You let go first.

638
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,333
-My arm hurts!
-Let go of me first.

639
00:51:59,333 --> 00:52:01,433
Hey! My arm!

640
00:52:01,867 --> 00:52:03,333
<i>You are the hole.</i>

641
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:06,033
<i>I'm trying to plug that hole.</i>

642
00:52:25,166 --> 00:52:28,233
Hey. That hurts!

643
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:29,233
Move!

644
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:54,467
Captain.

645
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:15,433
Captain.

646
00:53:16,467 --> 00:53:17,700
Are you all right?

647
00:53:26,633 --> 00:53:28,700
I don't think my heart is beating.

648
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:32,967
I need a defibrillator.

649
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:34,834
Bring a defibrillator.

650
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:36,233
A defibrillator.

651
00:53:37,633 --> 00:53:38,767
A defibrillator.

652
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:42,700
-Be quiet.
-That hurts.

653
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:44,433
Get in.

654
00:53:46,033 --> 00:53:48,233
Go easy, will you?

655
00:53:48,667 --> 00:53:50,567
It's not like I killed anyone.

656
00:53:50,967 --> 00:53:52,200
Yes, you did.

657
00:53:53,033 --> 00:53:54,333
Spy cameras and rape.

658
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:56,667
Those are ways of killing a person too.

659
00:54:00,467 --> 00:54:02,333
Should we take them to a detention center?

660
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,667
What about the car?
Should we take them to our station?

661
00:54:04,734 --> 00:54:06,000
-Let's go.
-What should we do?

662
00:54:06,066 --> 00:54:07,967
-What should we do?
-We're busy already.

663
00:54:08,033 --> 00:54:09,633
Is this the Cyber Investigation Team?

664
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:12,300
One of the victims is a cop,

665
00:54:13,133 --> 00:54:15,000
so make sure you delete her pictures.

666
00:54:15,867 --> 00:54:18,233
I'll send you the new website
for their spy camera pictures,

667
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:19,467
so please check it.

668
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:22,367
And give me a call
once the pictures are deleted.

669
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:24,667
Thank you.

670
00:54:24,734 --> 00:54:26,900
CAPTAIN OF INVESTIGATION TEAM 1
KO JI-SEOK

671
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:31,233
{\an8}LEE MAN-JIN, KANG SU-HO

672
00:54:37,233 --> 00:54:38,500
My picture looks good, right?

673
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:42,066
I look forward to working
with you, partner.

674
00:54:43,533 --> 00:54:44,500
Partner?

675
00:54:51,033 --> 00:54:54,667
You have a sense of duty,
and you're a great police officer.

676
00:54:56,066 --> 00:54:57,934
Thank you. I'll do my best.

677
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:58,834
But...

678
00:54:59,533 --> 00:55:00,934
But we're too different.

679
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,200
To be honest with you,
yesterday felt like a year to me.

680
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:07,333
I can't work like this...

681
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:10,800
every single day.

682
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:19,633
Captain.

683
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:22,867
I'm sorry.

684
00:55:25,433 --> 00:55:26,600
What's this?

685
00:55:27,166 --> 00:55:29,433
A few traffic violations,
speeding tickets,

686
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:30,734
and complaints.

687
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:34,967
I hope everything works out for you.

688
00:55:35,934 --> 00:55:38,266
Get home safely.

689
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:51,033
Let me ask you one thing, though.

690
00:55:55,233 --> 00:55:57,100
You applied to join the Subway Police

691
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,934
and memorized every corner
of every subway station.

692
00:56:02,834 --> 00:56:04,567
Are those because you're a member of SL?

693
00:56:06,667 --> 00:56:07,867
Is that all there is to it?

694
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:14,100
Why on earth have you memorized
the location of the mirrors, too?

695
00:56:18,667 --> 00:56:21,333
I will tell you if you accept me.

696
00:56:30,333 --> 00:56:31,367
You can go now.

697
00:56:45,767 --> 00:56:47,700
<i>The doors are opening.</i>

698
00:56:58,567 --> 00:56:59,967
I didn't memorize them.

699
00:57:07,333 --> 00:57:10,333
<i>A 23-year-old soldier, Mr. Choi,
who disappeared last night</i>

700
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,033
<i>between the platform and the turnstile,</i>

701
00:57:12,433 --> 00:57:15,166
was found dead inside a subway bench.

702
00:57:15,567 --> 00:57:18,200
There are many speculations
around it, but...

703
00:57:18,266 --> 00:57:20,000
At the time, he was wearing...

704
00:57:24,734 --> 00:57:27,934
Please review my sister's disappearance
as a subway murder case.

705
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,700
There's no reason to believe
that she is a victim of this case.

706
00:57:30,767 --> 00:57:32,734
She disappeared the same way.

707
00:57:33,633 --> 00:57:37,000
She disappeared between the platform
and the turnstile, too.

708
00:57:39,166 --> 00:57:40,533
She's 165 cm tall,

709
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,300
and she's my identical twin.

710
00:57:42,367 --> 00:57:43,600
She has level two autism.

711
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:47,100
Please.

712
00:57:47,633 --> 00:57:51,100
Please review her case
as a subway murder case.

713
00:57:51,166 --> 00:57:52,934
Please help me.

00:57:53,367 --> 00:57:55,900
We'll investigate her case
once her body is found.

715
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:57,166
PLEASE FIND MY TWIN SISTER

716
00:57:59,967 --> 00:58:01,000
Take her away.

717
00:58:03,433 --> 00:58:04,900
-Get her out of here.
-I'm sorry.

718
00:58:17,867 --> 00:58:20,300
{\an8}PLEASE FIND MY TWIN SISTER

719
00:58:27,734 --> 00:58:29,667

726
00:59:12,633 --> 00:59:14,066
I didn't memorize them.

727
00:59:17,633 --> 00:59:18,934
It got stuck in my head.

728
00:59:28,633 --> 00:59:31,066
FRESH MORNING JUICE

729
00:59:31,133 --> 00:59:33,934
I heard the Violent Crimes Team
and the Cyber Investigation Team

730
00:59:34,433 --> 00:59:36,100
all ignored my case.

731
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:38,867
If you had ignored me too, I...

732
00:59:43,867 --> 00:59:45,667
When the female officer gets back,

733
00:59:46,266 --> 00:59:48,834
please tell her I said thank you.

734
00:59:50,867 --> 00:59:51,700
Take care.

735
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:59,000
Please tell her she said thank you.

736
00:59:59,066 --> 01:00:00,433
Fine, okay.

737
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,166
It looks like I'm destined
to work to death in this life.

738
01:00:05,233 --> 01:00:07,400
-There's too much work.
-There is too much work.

739
01:00:07,467 --> 01:00:08,767
-Let's stay up for three nights.
-Okay.

740
01:00:08,834 --> 01:00:10,567
-I'll do everything.
-I'll help, too.

741
01:00:10,633 --> 01:00:13,433
Captain wouldn't know. Let's get to work.

742
01:00:24,633 --> 01:00:26,133
OFFICER YOO RYEONG

743
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:28,967
Good work...

744
01:00:34,233 --> 01:00:36,800
The victim

745
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:39,033
wanted to thank...

746
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:43,834
Today...

747
01:00:47,667 --> 01:00:49,200
Today...

748
01:01:05,367 --> 01:01:07,567
<i>I need you to be on night duty tonight.</i>

749
01:01:15,166 --> 01:01:16,400
SUBWAY POLICE POSITION HAS BEEN FILLED

750
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:41,200
The rookie is here.

751
01:01:43,567 --> 01:01:44,633
Good to see you, Rookie.

752
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:48,200
I may be younger, but I am your senior.

753
01:01:48,767 --> 01:01:49,800
Nice to see you, Rookie.

754
01:01:49,867 --> 01:01:51,200
It's nice to see you, sir.

755
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,066
Nine for you.

756
01:01:58,367 --> 01:01:59,200
One for you.

757
01:01:59,834 --> 01:02:01,367
I can't drink them all.

758
01:02:01,633 --> 01:02:02,834
Let's all share.

759
01:02:03,533 --> 01:02:04,800
Captain.

760
01:02:05,266 --> 01:02:06,266
Mr. Kang.

761
01:02:06,867 --> 01:02:08,700
-Mr. Lee.
-Thank you.

762
01:02:09,567 --> 01:02:11,900
So I stay here all night
for my night duty?

763
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:16,266
Once the exits are closed,

764
01:02:16,333 --> 01:02:19,266
no one can come in or leave.

765
01:02:19,333 --> 01:02:23,567
You are buried alive on B4.

766
01:02:23,633 --> 01:02:25,367
-That's not all.
-Right.

767
01:02:25,433 --> 01:02:26,500
Down here,

768
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:29,667
there's the Subway Ghost.

769
01:02:30,367 --> 01:02:33,200
The stationmaster says that at 2 a.m.,

770
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:35,033
the ghost...

771
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:40,967
Stop it.

772
01:02:46,467 --> 01:02:49,266
Go home before you are buried alive.

773
01:02:49,333 --> 01:02:50,166
It's late.

774
01:02:50,233 --> 01:02:51,734
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

775
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:54,367
-Good work, everyone.
-Good work.

776
01:02:54,433 --> 01:02:55,266
Good luck.

777
01:02:55,333 --> 01:02:57,400
Congratulations on your first night duty.

778
01:02:57,467 --> 01:02:59,266
Thank you. Go home safely.

779
01:02:59,333 --> 01:03:01,266
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

780
01:03:01,667 --> 01:03:02,667
Let's go.

781
01:03:07,667 --> 01:03:08,834
You should get ready to sleep.

782
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:12,400
Where is the night-duty room for women?

783
01:03:12,467 --> 01:03:13,867
You see...

784
01:03:14,867 --> 01:03:16,433
We don't have one.

785
01:03:17,033 --> 01:03:19,900
I put in a request,
so it'll be sorted out soon.

786
01:03:20,533 --> 01:03:22,600
I'll sleep out here,
so go ahead and sleep.

787
01:03:22,667 --> 01:03:24,400
No, I'll sleep out here.

788
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:25,567
Go on in.

789
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:28,033
It's okay. I can sleep here.

790
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:32,000
I must look at more camera footage
to catch the Locust Swarm.

791
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:34,533
Go on in.

792
01:03:35,834 --> 01:03:37,633
Okay then.

793
01:03:42,667 --> 01:03:43,633
Good night.

794
01:03:44,333 --> 01:03:45,200
Good night.

795
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:51,133
If they were killed out of revenge,

796
01:03:52,467 --> 01:03:55,066
there must be a link among the victims.

797
01:03:58,200 --> 01:03:59,667
Why can't we find anything?

798
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:02,433
Chief Ha.

799
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,967
What if this woman was the first victim?

MISSING AUTISTIC WOMAN CASE

801
01:04:19,266 --> 01:04:20,767
You've kept this all this time?

802
01:04:20,834 --> 01:04:22,100
Just like Ms. Yoo Ryeong said,

803
01:04:23,667 --> 01:04:26,200
if her sister, Yoo Jin,
is the Subway Ghost's first victim,

804
01:04:27,967 --> 01:04:30,934
we might be able to find a link.

805
01:04:31,934 --> 01:04:33,333
She's not part of this case.

806
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:35,633
Her body was never found.

807
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:38,000
There's no proof that she was killed,

808
01:04:38,066 --> 01:04:40,033
so how can her case be
a serial murder case?

809
01:04:41,734 --> 01:04:45,266
We're missing some footage by the stairs.
Ask Ko Ji-seok to get it for us.

<i>Why did you go in the tunnel?</i>

825

the Subway Police because of the tunnel</i>

826
01:09:26,467 --> 01:09:28,467
<i>and whether the answer is
really in the tunnel?</i>

<i>The man will show up within an hour

<i>We must get him quickly.</i>

Don't move, or I'll shoot.
