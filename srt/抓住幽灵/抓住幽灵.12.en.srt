00:00:00,166 --> 00:00:02,767
CATCH THE GHOST

00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,867
{\an8}CATCH THE GHOST

3
00:00:24,934 --> 00:00:25,867
THIS DRAMA IS FICTION

4
00:00:25,934 --> 00:00:27,800
THE CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
INSTITUTIONS, AND EVENTS AREN'T REAL

5
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,633
Don't move, or I'll shoot.

6
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:32,567
Arrest them.

7
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:34,900
Run.

8
00:00:37,934 --> 00:00:39,133
Damn it.

9
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,433
Locust. Grab them!

10
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,467
Catch him!

11
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,633
I just rented out the ship to them.

12
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,533
They told me that they were going fishing.

13
00:01:05,533 --> 00:01:06,734
Where's the last one?

14
00:01:19,633 --> 00:01:20,667
Son.

15
00:01:23,967 --> 00:01:27,734
I'm exhausted now.

16
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:55,500
{\an8}EPISODE 12

17
00:02:05,266 --> 00:02:06,967
Why are you here when you're suspended?

18
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,734
You don't mind if you get fired?

19
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,667
You said you couldn't join the RIU
because of your mom.

20
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:17,233
That's why you broke up with me, too.
But what is this now?

21
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,200
Explain why you gave up everything...

22
00:02:27,433 --> 00:02:28,467
and ran here.

23
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:40,200
Well...

24
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,233
Ma-ri.

25
00:02:49,667 --> 00:02:51,333
Ever since Rookie joined our team,

26
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,033
she kept stirring me up.

27
00:02:57,033 --> 00:02:59,867
At first, it was uncomfortable
and annoying,

28
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,767
and I wanted to ignore it.

29
00:03:08,233 --> 00:03:10,266
But then I realized
I couldn't avoid it anymore.

30
00:03:13,033 --> 00:03:15,166
The person that I was before.

31
00:03:16,433 --> 00:03:18,300
The reason why
I became a police officer...

32
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:22,200
and where I want to run toward.

33
00:03:25,533 --> 00:03:29,300
Rookie reminded me of them again.

34
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,967
You are your old self again.

35
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,333
The Ko Ji-seok I fell in love with.

36
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,233
But...

37
00:03:46,567 --> 00:03:48,700
You can't come back to me, right?

38
00:03:56,467 --> 00:03:57,633
I'm sorry.

39
00:04:12,934 --> 00:04:14,066
Hey, get off.

40
00:04:14,133 --> 00:04:17,333
We'll go return this car
and take the subway.

41
00:04:17,867 --> 00:04:20,033
Okay. Good work, Detective Lee.

42
00:04:21,767 --> 00:04:22,667
Bye, Su-ho.

43
00:04:23,567 --> 00:04:25,133
Bye. Good work today.

44
00:04:30,433 --> 00:04:31,300
You should go, too.

45
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,233
Okay.

46
00:04:37,467 --> 00:04:38,433
Wait.

47
00:04:42,834 --> 00:04:46,700
I don't want you to be
in a bind anymore because of me.

48
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,633
If you show up like this
when you're suspended...

49
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,533
I'm okay.

50
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,066
I'm not.

51
00:04:55,934 --> 00:04:58,000
You were suspended because of me.

52
00:04:58,734 --> 00:05:01,533
-I can't cause you more trouble.
-I'm really fine.

53
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,033
But I'm not okay with it.

54
00:05:05,533 --> 00:05:06,834
I will call you

55
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:08,967
after I catch him.

56
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,133
After you catch him?

57
00:05:17,033 --> 00:05:18,066
Then I guess

58
00:05:19,567 --> 00:05:21,367
I won't be able to see you for a while.

59
00:05:23,133 --> 00:05:24,033
All right.

60
00:05:24,834 --> 00:05:27,166
That's your top priority, after all.

61
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,667
See you later.

62
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:35,066
Also...

63
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,500
Don't forget to eat...

64
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:43,000
and make sure you get enough sleep. And...

65
00:05:43,066 --> 00:05:44,900
Okay. I'll get going now.

66
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,867
Rookie.

67
00:05:57,367 --> 00:05:59,834
REGIONAL INVESTIGATION UNIT

68
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:00,800
Go inside.

69
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,467
Aren't they the Locust Swarm?

70
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:08,700
Yes, they are.

71
00:06:10,033 --> 00:06:13,600
But why did the RIU
catch the Locust Swarm?

72
00:06:19,934 --> 00:06:22,700
Hello, Director Choi.
I have something to ask you.

73
00:06:22,767 --> 00:06:24,200
-Yes, Detective Park.
-Yes.

74
00:06:24,867 --> 00:06:27,400
<i>We should be investigated
by the Subway Police.</i>

75
00:06:27,467 --> 00:06:30,200
Send us there.

76
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,467
Neither of them is the Subway Ghost.

77
00:06:41,533 --> 00:06:43,467
The DNA from the hideout...

78
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,700
doesn't match either of theirs.

79
00:06:47,767 --> 00:06:48,667
What?

80
00:06:48,734 --> 00:06:50,633
Let's go to the Subway Police.

81
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,333
Sit back down!

82
00:07:00,834 --> 00:07:03,533
So the one that ran away
is the Subway Ghost?

83
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,300
His name, age, and family.
Tell me everything you know.

84
00:07:08,367 --> 00:07:11,667
His name is Boss. He's older than I am.

85
00:07:11,734 --> 00:07:12,967
That's all we know.

86
00:07:15,367 --> 00:07:17,400
Is that what you call an act of loyalty?

87
00:07:19,567 --> 00:07:21,500
He's a serial killer.

88
00:07:25,734 --> 00:07:28,867
A serial killer? Come on.

89
00:07:30,567 --> 00:07:31,400
Chief Ha.

90
00:07:33,433 --> 00:07:36,400
<i>This is the police, right? I'm dying here.</i>

91
00:07:36,467 --> 00:07:38,800
<i>Two murderers are after me.</i>

92
00:07:38,867 --> 00:07:40,166
<i>They are the Locust Swarm.</i>

93
00:07:40,233 --> 00:07:42,767
<i>One of them could be the Subway Ghost.</i>

94
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:50,033
Han Tae-ung, you bastard.

95
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,200
Han Tae-ung? Is that his name?

96
00:07:53,266 --> 00:07:56,066
Han Tae-ung. He is 31 years old.

97
00:07:57,567 --> 00:07:59,000
He's 31 years old, and...

98
00:08:03,967 --> 00:08:05,600
They really don't know anything else?

99
00:08:07,266 --> 00:08:08,800
Han Tae-ung. Thirty-one years old.

100
00:08:13,533 --> 00:08:15,800
What about his family?

101
00:08:15,867 --> 00:08:17,567
-We don't know.
-Where does he live?

102
00:08:17,633 --> 00:08:19,033
We don't know.

103
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,700
We just lived together.

104
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:22,834
Where?

105
00:08:32,266 --> 00:08:34,266
{\an8}NO ENTRY
INVESTIGATION IN PROGRESS

106
00:08:34,734 --> 00:08:37,500
"Podori at the Subway Police's
30th-anniversary event

107
00:08:37,567 --> 00:08:39,767
is the Subway Ghost. Shocking news."

108
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,734
"Podori, the police mascot,
is the Subway Ghost."

109
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,066
How did this article get published?

110
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,300
Well, I tried to stop it, but...

111
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:56,567
We're not even sure
Locust Swarm is the Subway Ghost.

112
00:08:56,633 --> 00:09:00,333
How can you let
this article get published?

113
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,567
-I'm sorry.
-Take care of this right now.

114
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,166
Hey. Stop the reporters.

115
00:09:20,633 --> 00:09:22,133
Ko Ji-seok.

116
00:09:23,934 --> 00:09:27,266
I need you out in order for me to survive.

117
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,667
When the body was found
at the 30th-anniversary event,

118
00:09:33,734 --> 00:09:36,500
it was Boss who insisted
that we get on that train

119
00:09:36,567 --> 00:09:38,033
and steal from the cops.

120
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,233
So he hid the body there
and acted like he was sad

121
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,667
because we weren't trending
on the Internet

122
00:09:42,734 --> 00:09:44,367
because of the Subway Ghost?

123
00:09:44,433 --> 00:09:46,233
Shit. I've got goosebumps.

124
00:09:56,033 --> 00:10:00,000
Han Tae-ung's DNA matches the DNA found

125
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:02,433
in the Subway Ghost's hideout.

126
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,867
So he's definitely
the Subway Ghost, right?

127
00:10:09,133 --> 00:10:12,300
I looked into it. He's not Han Tae-ung.

128
00:10:12,367 --> 00:10:13,200
What?

129
00:10:13,266 --> 00:10:15,900
He stole the identity
of a homeless person named Han Tae-ung.

130
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:19,233
We can't identify him at the moment.

131
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,867
We don't know his identity?

132
00:10:22,066 --> 00:10:26,133
He's not Han Tae-ung?

133
00:10:27,433 --> 00:10:29,000
We even saw his ID card.

134
00:10:29,066 --> 00:10:29,900
No.

135
00:10:31,066 --> 00:10:32,333
You know him.

136
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,033
You lived with him for two years.

137
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,834
Tell us anything you can remember.

138
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,367
Anything!

139
00:10:58,734 --> 00:10:59,834
You...

140
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:06,100
You're his mother.

141
00:11:22,133 --> 00:11:23,500
One, two, three. Shock!

142
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:26,834
-Go bring the epinephrine.
-Okay.

143
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,233
Her BP keeps dropping.

144
00:11:30,467 --> 00:11:31,567
Chest compression.

145
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:34,467
More.

146
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,333
Ms. Choi Mi-ra just passed away.

147
00:12:15,567 --> 00:12:16,400
What?

148
00:12:17,567 --> 00:12:18,467
No.

149
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,066
<i>You totaled the scooter.</i>

150
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,633
I spent my savings to buy the owner
a new one and fixed this one.

151
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,633
This is ours now.

152
00:13:51,867 --> 00:13:55,433
I blew the tire recently, Rookie.

153
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,967
The tire burst while I was racing
with Kim Wu-hyeok,

154
00:14:02,567 --> 00:14:04,233
so I've been mad at this scooter.

155
00:14:07,433 --> 00:14:08,633
But it's still ours...

156
00:14:12,667 --> 00:14:14,834
So I gave it the most expensive tire.

157
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,667
RICE

158
00:14:35,734 --> 00:14:38,533
<i>I bought rice and a few side dishes,</i>

159
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,400
<i>so have proper meals
instead of cup noodles.</i>

160
00:16:02,934 --> 00:16:04,100
Here.

161
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,533
Open wide.

162
00:16:09,367 --> 00:16:10,400
It's good.

163
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:26,734
Ae-Sim, when you miss me,
how do you deal with it?

164
00:16:28,467 --> 00:16:29,734
I just...

165
00:16:31,834 --> 00:16:35,367
go over the memories I made with you.

166
00:16:36,633 --> 00:16:38,100
Go over the memories...

167
00:16:39,433 --> 00:16:40,734
-Honey.
-Yes?

168
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,266
I'm full. I want to stop eating.

169
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:45,533
-Okay.
-I want to sleep.

170
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,867
There.

171
00:16:47,467 --> 00:16:49,400
Lie down, Ae-sim.

172
00:17:10,066 --> 00:17:11,633
These are the only pictures I have.

173
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,834
I don't have a single picture
to remember her with.

174
00:17:24,233 --> 00:17:25,133
Oh, right.

175
00:17:29,533 --> 00:17:30,567
Yes, Detective Lee.

176
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:34,233
<i>Captain. You know, the man
who was tailing Rookie.</i>

177
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:37,300
<i>He was the Subway Ghost.</i>

178
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,433
I'm worried.

179
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,533
It's making me anxious.

180
00:19:10,133 --> 00:19:11,200
Good night.

181
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:45,967
I'd like to ask for your opinion

182
00:19:46,033 --> 00:19:48,000
about Captain Ko Ji-seok's
suspension issue.

183
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,100
Go ahead.

184
00:19:54,767 --> 00:19:57,500
We did lose one
of the Locust Swarm members,

185
00:19:57,567 --> 00:20:02,233
but Captain Ko contributed a lot
to catching the other two.

186
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,133
So?

187
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:09,033
The disciplinary committee is saying
that he should be reinstated soon.

188
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,033
I agree with them, too.

189
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,133
-Really?
-Yes.

190
00:20:15,367 --> 00:20:18,633
Then go ahead.

191
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,667
Thank you.

192
00:20:42,433 --> 00:20:43,400
Yes, Commissioner Kim.

193
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,233
What?

194
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,633
Really?

195
00:20:51,867 --> 00:20:54,500
Thank you.

196
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:59,734
Does that mean I might be able
to return to the Subway Police?

197
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,367
Okay. I'll wait.

198
00:21:04,433 --> 00:21:05,333
Goodbye.

199
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:16,500
She must be busy, right?

200
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,333
{\an8}Rookie.

201
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,967
{\an8}I might go back to the Subway Police.

202
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,100
{\an8}She's not there anyway.

203
00:21:35,133 --> 00:21:36,300
Yes, Detective Lee.

204
00:21:37,734 --> 00:21:39,200
-Father.
-Yes.

205
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:44,166
So you're returning
to the Subway Police, right?

206
00:21:44,233 --> 00:21:45,934
Well, nothing's decided yet, but...

207
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,266
Probably?

208
00:21:50,667 --> 00:21:52,533
Does Detective Yoo know?

209
00:21:53,967 --> 00:21:54,967
No.

210
00:21:56,834 --> 00:21:59,000
I haven't told her
because I thought she'd be busy.

211
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:03,900
What's going on between you two?

212
00:22:03,967 --> 00:22:06,467
I'm sure it's nothing.

213
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:07,400
Hey.

214
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,500
It's not nothing.

215
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:12,834
So are you two dating?
Did you tell her how you feel?

216
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,500
No, I didn't, but...

217
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:17,633
See? They're strangers.

218
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:22,133
Hey, come on. They're not strangers.

219
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:26,033
They have this comradeship between them.

220
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,100
Of course.

221
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:29,800
Comradeship. That's poisonous.

222
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:31,934
Why?

223
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,967
You protected her,
cleaned up her mess for her,

224
00:22:36,033 --> 00:22:37,667
and even got suspended for her.

225
00:22:37,734 --> 00:22:40,200
This is something

226
00:22:40,266 --> 00:22:42,667
even family members
can't do for each other.

227
00:22:42,734 --> 00:22:47,266
But you've done those
under the name of a comrade.

228
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:52,033
So even though you two should've been
boyfriend and girlfriend long ago,

229
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,867
you two have just become comrades.

230
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,033
"Comrades"?

231
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,333
You're right. Yes.

232
00:23:00,266 --> 00:23:03,467
A relationship is hard
to change once it's set.

233
00:23:03,533 --> 00:23:06,767
-It gets awkward.
-Right.

234
00:23:06,834 --> 00:23:08,333
-Love...
-Yes?

235
00:23:09,066 --> 00:23:11,233
-It's all about timing, Captain.
-That's right.

236
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,600
You're about to blow your chance,

237
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,767
so go tell her how you feel now.

238
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,133
Captain.

239
00:23:18,967 --> 00:23:20,400
You can do it.

240
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:21,967
Ma'am.

241
00:23:23,533 --> 00:23:26,567
{\an8}About the reinstatement
of Captain Ko Ji-seok...

242
00:23:26,633 --> 00:23:27,467
{\an8}Yes.

243
00:23:27,533 --> 00:23:30,300
I found the perfect place for him.

244
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:32,467
{\an8}He can be reinstated within a week.

245
00:23:32,533 --> 00:23:35,133
{\an8}Really? Where?

246
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,834
It's the head position
at Narang Island Patrol Station.

247
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,233
Narang Island?

248
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,767
It's an island in Namhae.

249
00:23:41,834 --> 00:23:44,600
It has become well-known
as the backdrop of Korean dramas,

250
00:23:44,667 --> 00:23:46,266
and it has become quite popular.

251
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:48,100
What are you talking about?

252
00:23:48,166 --> 00:23:50,467
The local government wants
to pursue a project

253
00:23:50,533 --> 00:23:54,500
to develop the island
into a tourist destination,

254
00:23:54,567 --> 00:23:57,433
but Narang Island Patrol Station is

255
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:01,967
filled with older officers
who aren't fit for the project.

256
00:24:02,033 --> 00:24:03,467
Therefore, if Captain Ko,

257
00:24:03,533 --> 00:24:06,100
who's handsome enough to be an actor,
fights well and smart,

258
00:24:06,166 --> 00:24:08,000
joins the patrol station,

259
00:24:08,066 --> 00:24:12,033
it could encourage
the Korean police wave trend.

260
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,433
What kind of bull...

261
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,033
That's ridiculous!

262
00:24:16,667 --> 00:24:18,133
Well, you see...

263
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:24,000
Captain Ko has to take care of his mother.

264
00:24:24,066 --> 00:24:25,533
He can't go that far.

265
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:29,266
Namhae is six hours by car
from here and a few hours by boat.

266
00:24:30,734 --> 00:24:31,767
No way.

267
00:24:36,133 --> 00:24:39,133
Oh, did I tell you?

268
00:24:39,934 --> 00:24:43,967
The disciplinary committee is
wondering how Captain Ko,

269
00:24:44,033 --> 00:24:47,066
who was suspended,
caught the Locust Swarm.

270
00:24:47,934 --> 00:24:50,100
You'd get in a lot of trouble

271
00:24:50,166 --> 00:24:53,166
if they find out
that you personally gave an order

272
00:24:53,233 --> 00:24:55,734
to a suspended officer to investigate
a case, you'll be in a bind.

273
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,867
Are you blackmailing me?

274
00:24:57,934 --> 00:25:01,333
No. I'm just worried about you.

275
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,467
On top of that,

276
00:25:03,533 --> 00:25:07,934
Captain Ko is suspended,
so if he gets into a financial problem,

277
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,500
he'll quit.

278
00:25:10,567 --> 00:25:14,834
Once he is reinstated,
he'll be paid every month again,

279
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:20,233
so isn't this better
for his sick mother, too?

280
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,133
I understood what you said,

281
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,700
-so leave.
-Okay.

282
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,600
Rookie, I'll protect you from now on.

283
00:25:48,266 --> 00:25:50,400
No, she wouldn't get what I'm saying.

284
00:25:51,233 --> 00:25:54,400
Nothing is easy with her.

285
00:26:03,867 --> 00:26:04,700
Rookie.

286
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:08,567
May I continue to be

287
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,900
your seat belt?

288
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,333
That's terrible.

289
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,066
That was horrible.

290
00:26:20,133 --> 00:26:22,533
Get a grip, Ji-seok.

291
00:26:29,667 --> 00:26:34,200
Rookie, be my girlfriend.

292
00:26:46,033 --> 00:26:47,033
Yes, Commissioner Kim.

293
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,433
What?

294
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:18,767
I shouldn't have handed you
those handcuffs then.

295
00:27:20,533 --> 00:27:22,734
I made a mistake.

296
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,500
-I'm sorry, Ji-seok.
-It's okay, ma'am.

297
00:27:26,367 --> 00:27:29,233
I would've gone anyway.

298
00:27:31,734 --> 00:27:33,100
I was careless.

299
00:27:38,867 --> 00:27:39,767
By the way...

300
00:27:40,734 --> 00:27:42,200
What about your mother?

301
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,900
She doesn't know anything...

302
00:27:59,166 --> 00:28:01,266
so she'll be asking for me day and night.

303
00:28:02,233 --> 00:28:04,166
If you endure it for a year
on Narang Island,

304
00:28:04,233 --> 00:28:08,233
I will do everything in my power
to get you reinstated.

305
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,133
I'm sorry.

306
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:15,300
Here you go.

307
00:28:15,367 --> 00:28:17,000
Open wide.

308
00:28:21,834 --> 00:28:22,767
It's good.

309
00:28:25,834 --> 00:28:27,934
-I'm going on a business trip.
-What?

310
00:28:28,934 --> 00:28:31,200
Where to? For how long?

311
00:28:31,266 --> 00:28:33,467
A bit far.

312
00:28:33,533 --> 00:28:34,867
For a while.

313
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,700
So I can't see you anymore?

314
00:28:40,567 --> 00:28:46,066
I do such a good job at work
that they are asking me to go.

315
00:28:54,467 --> 00:28:58,967
Don't forget to eat while I'm gone...

316
00:29:01,834 --> 00:29:03,767
and listen to Auntie Gyeong-hui.

317
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,133
Okay?

318
00:29:10,266 --> 00:29:11,967
I'll come as often as possible.

319
00:29:16,133 --> 00:29:17,300
Promise me.

320
00:29:35,867 --> 00:29:38,633
I have a week left.

321
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,867
I can protect you...

322
00:29:45,633 --> 00:29:47,600
for another week, Rookie.

323
00:30:50,533 --> 00:30:51,567
Damn it.

324
00:30:55,166 --> 00:30:58,834
He's been watching her for a long time?

325
00:31:06,333 --> 00:31:08,333
SEOUN METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

326
00:31:12,667 --> 00:31:13,500
Ma-ri.

327
00:31:15,533 --> 00:31:19,433
You have to compare the DNA here
to the Subway Ghost's DNA.

328
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,767
-What?
-I was at Rookie's house

329
00:31:20,834 --> 00:31:21,900
all night last night and...

330
00:31:21,967 --> 00:31:23,233
-What?
-Well...

331
00:31:24,767 --> 00:31:27,333
You see... I wasn't with her.

332
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,133
I was worried about her,
so I stayed in front of her house.

333
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,033
And...

334
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:39,734
A man seemed to be watching her house.

335
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,633
I found these from where he was standing.

336
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:45,100
If he's after Rookie,
he could be the Subway Ghost.

337
00:31:45,166 --> 00:31:47,800
You look absolutely ridiculous right now.

338
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,467
What?

339
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:53,934
Someone was after Officer Yoo,
and you think it's the Subway Ghost?

340
00:31:55,667 --> 00:31:58,367
Yes. You were right to come to me.

341
00:31:58,433 --> 00:31:59,266
But...

342
00:32:01,367 --> 00:32:04,133
You should've at least
calmed your breath before coming in.

343
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,233
You should at least try to hide
such a worried look on your face.

344
00:32:11,333 --> 00:32:13,633
I heard you'll be transferred
to an island in a week.

345
00:32:14,734 --> 00:32:16,433
Mind your own business.

346
00:32:17,266 --> 00:32:18,166
Kim Wu-hyeok.

347
00:32:18,967 --> 00:32:21,233
Go do a stakeout
at Officer Yoo's house all night.

348
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,734
I still have a week left.

349
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,500
I can't stand to listen to this.

350
00:32:26,567 --> 00:32:27,400
I'm sorry.

351
00:32:28,834 --> 00:32:31,667
Wu-hyeok, you must be busy
because of the investigation.

352
00:32:31,734 --> 00:32:33,667
I don't have any work to do
for a week, so...

353
00:32:33,734 --> 00:32:34,934
Staking out is part of the investigation.

354
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:36,900
You should go, Mr. Ko.

355
00:32:38,867 --> 00:32:41,500
Fine. I'll leave.

356
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,567
I'll go undercover starting tonight.

357
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,200
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

358
00:33:01,266 --> 00:33:03,467
Good morning, Chief Ha.

359
00:33:05,967 --> 00:33:08,900
What is that? Did you find some clues?

360
00:33:08,967 --> 00:33:10,400
These were found near your house.

361
00:33:11,266 --> 00:33:15,233
The Subway Ghost came after you last time,
so who knows?

362
00:33:16,867 --> 00:33:19,667
-Let's go to the NFS.
-Okay.

363
00:33:19,967 --> 00:33:20,834
Right.

364
00:33:21,633 --> 00:33:22,967
You too.

365
00:33:23,033 --> 00:33:25,533
The DNA test results
for the fabric must be out, too.

366
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,800
Okay.

367
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,300
Do you have the results?

368
00:33:33,367 --> 00:33:37,200
The DNA from the fabric
and the DNA on this cotton swab

369
00:33:37,266 --> 00:33:39,800
are a 99.9 percent match.

370
00:33:41,333 --> 00:33:45,867
The DNA from the fabric
matches Ms. Yoo's DNA?

371
00:33:45,934 --> 00:33:47,967
I wasn't sure, but I was right.

372
00:33:50,367 --> 00:33:52,734
Your sister was indeed responsible.

373
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,867
My sister doesn't know anything.

374
00:33:55,934 --> 00:33:58,767
She has level two autism,
so she's like an elementary school girl.

375
00:33:58,834 --> 00:34:00,734
How can she be responsible for anything?

376
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,834
She's right.
Ms. Yoo's sister is basically a kid.

377
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,800
When a kid messes up,

378
00:34:05,867 --> 00:34:08,166
the guardian should take
the responsibility.

379
00:34:08,233 --> 00:34:10,266
So try to remember.

380
00:34:10,333 --> 00:34:13,800
What did your kid-like sister do?

381
00:34:15,233 --> 00:34:18,066
Remember everything
down to the smallest things

382
00:34:18,133 --> 00:34:20,000
like stepping on someone's toe
and report to me.

383
00:34:35,467 --> 00:34:37,000
You don't need to watch my house.

384
00:34:38,266 --> 00:34:40,600
There is no reason
for the Subway Ghost to risk

385
00:34:40,667 --> 00:34:42,734
getting caught and come after me.

386
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,800
What if he does come?
I can't let you be in danger.

387
00:34:48,834 --> 00:34:52,166
So you think my sister is
responsible for this

388
00:34:52,233 --> 00:34:54,166
so he will come back to get me, too?

389
00:34:54,233 --> 00:34:58,367
Ms. Yoo, denial isn't the answer here.

390
00:34:58,433 --> 00:34:59,633
Either way,

391
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:02,767
we must find the reason why
your sister's DNA was on the fabric

392
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:05,166
to know the whole story behind this case.

393
00:35:05,233 --> 00:35:06,900
So let's face it head-on.

394
00:35:17,433 --> 00:35:18,467
Captain.

395
00:35:19,233 --> 00:35:20,200
You're late.

396
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:25,867
Thanks, Wu-hyeok, for walking her home.

397
00:35:25,934 --> 00:35:27,500
I said I'll stake out.

398
00:35:28,767 --> 00:35:29,600
Go home.

399
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:33,133
I'll be staying here all night.

400
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:34,734
What?

401
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,934
Both of you should go.

402
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,667
I can protect myself.

403
00:35:38,734 --> 00:35:41,233
Ms. Yoo, we're investigating a case.

404
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,467
Mr. Ko, you shouldn't be here.

405
00:35:45,533 --> 00:35:47,900
He knows what you look like.

406
00:35:47,967 --> 00:35:49,700
He'll run away if he sees you.

407
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:52,066
Just one week.

408
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,066
-Can't you allow me one week?
-One week?

409
00:35:59,133 --> 00:36:00,567
Either way, it's meaningless.

410
00:36:02,266 --> 00:36:03,100
You're right.

411
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:09,433
Don't worry.

412
00:36:13,533 --> 00:36:14,500
Go on in.

413
00:36:15,934 --> 00:36:17,033
Goodbye.

414
00:36:35,967 --> 00:36:39,367
<i>If you have more people
you want to protect,</i>

415
00:36:39,433 --> 00:36:42,633
<i>you must protect yourself first.</i>

416
00:36:45,233 --> 00:36:46,066
She's right.

417
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,667
You can go.

418
00:37:11,633 --> 00:37:13,467
If he does come here,

419
00:37:13,533 --> 00:37:15,934
I won't lose him like a fool
like last time.

420
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,266
I know.

421
00:37:19,867 --> 00:37:21,567
You'll get him.

422
00:37:21,633 --> 00:37:24,600
But I want to be by your side when you do.

423
00:37:26,467 --> 00:37:29,800
Did you know
that I put an umbrella over you

424
00:37:29,867 --> 00:37:32,066
<i>when you were being rained on
two years ago?</i>

425
00:37:32,133 --> 00:37:34,633
<i>I stood there for almost an hour</i>

426
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,600
<i>and I got soaked instead.</i>

427
00:37:37,967 --> 00:37:39,767
<i>That day,</i>

428
00:37:39,834 --> 00:37:42,633
<i>you looked like
a person who couldn't sense</i>

429
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,934
<i>whether it was raining or not.</i>

430
00:37:47,133 --> 00:37:49,100
I just felt a bit bad for you then.

431
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:54,934
Since that day,
I have always been curious about you.

432
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,266
That afternoon, the sun came out.

433
00:38:00,066 --> 00:38:01,633
While I was looking at the sun,

434
00:38:02,467 --> 00:38:06,767
I wondered, "Does she know
the sun's out today?"

435
00:38:06,834 --> 00:38:09,033
The next day, there was
a nice, cool breeze.

436
00:38:09,767 --> 00:38:10,734
I wondered,

437
00:38:11,467 --> 00:38:14,533
"Does she know
there is a nice breeze today?"

438
00:38:16,934 --> 00:38:17,767
Detective Kim.

439
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:24,734
I've said some harsh things to you,

440
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,734
but they weren't directed to you.

441
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,133
They were directed at myself.

442
00:38:36,367 --> 00:38:40,767
Detective Kim, you're a great person.

443
00:38:40,834 --> 00:38:42,834
If you tell me that now,

444
00:38:44,433 --> 00:38:46,567
I can't be petty.

445
00:38:47,834 --> 00:38:49,333
Oh, forget it.

446
00:38:52,033 --> 00:38:54,367
Those cigarette butts...

447
00:38:54,433 --> 00:38:55,967
Mr. Ko found them.

448
00:38:57,133 --> 00:39:00,900
He's been guarding you
from the yard every night.

449
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,900
Captain did?

450
00:39:02,967 --> 00:39:06,567
He saw a suspicious man
watching your house

451
00:39:06,633 --> 00:39:08,200
and found those cigarette butts.

452
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,467
That's how I ended up
coming to watch your place.

453
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,667
Mr. Ko is to be transferred to an island.

454
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:21,000
An island? Why? When?

455
00:39:21,066 --> 00:39:22,533
He's leaving in a week.

456
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,900
Once he goes, he can't return
for at least a year.

457
00:39:31,033 --> 00:39:37,233
{\an8}WE WILL WORK FOR THE CITIZENS' SAFETY

458
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,667
Did we have an appointment?

459
00:40:03,433 --> 00:40:05,367
I'm sorry about barging in
on you like this.

460
00:40:05,433 --> 00:40:08,200
-I have something to tell you.
-What is it?

461
00:40:08,266 --> 00:40:12,300
Please reinstate Captain
to the Subway Police.

462
00:40:12,367 --> 00:40:13,734
What are you doing?

463
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,600
I'm not asking you to do this for free.

464
00:40:16,467 --> 00:40:18,934
Within a week, Captain and I will...

465
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,333
Within a week?

466
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,200
We'll catch the Subway Ghost.

467
00:40:22,266 --> 00:40:24,066
Goodness.

468
00:40:24,967 --> 00:40:29,166
I didn't realize the Subway Police
had such a talented officer.

469
00:40:29,233 --> 00:40:31,633
If it were that simple,
you should've caught him sooner.

470
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,467
Stop with this nonsense and leave.

471
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,934
-Now.
-Wait.

472
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:45,033
Do you have an idea of how you'll do it?

473
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,767
Ma'am.

474
00:40:46,834 --> 00:40:49,900
Even Chief Ha hasn't been able
to resolve it for the past two years.

475
00:40:49,967 --> 00:40:51,734
This petty officer can't...

476
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,433
Officer Jeon.

477
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:56,333
It doesn't cost money
to hear her out, does it?

478
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,233
Sure.

479
00:40:59,767 --> 00:41:02,700
I'm sure you already know
that the Subway Ghost is

480
00:41:02,767 --> 00:41:03,800
one of the Locust Swarm.

481
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:07,467
It was thanks to the Subway Police

482
00:41:07,533 --> 00:41:10,500
that we found out that the Subway Ghost
is one of the Locust Swarm

483
00:41:10,567 --> 00:41:13,300
and we were able
to make the wanted posters.

484
00:41:14,166 --> 00:41:17,700
So I'm going to go after
the Subway Ghost the same way

485
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:19,600
the Subway Police
went after the Locust Swarm.

486
00:41:19,667 --> 00:41:23,133
So you will go after the Locust Swarm,

487
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,767
not the Subway Ghost?

488
00:41:26,834 --> 00:41:28,066
Yes.

489
00:41:28,133 --> 00:41:31,166
Just give me a week. Please.

490
00:41:31,233 --> 00:41:32,266
That...

491
00:41:34,066 --> 00:41:36,800
That would give me
the longer end of the stick.

492
00:41:38,066 --> 00:41:43,033
Captain Ko would be packing up
for the week anyway.

493
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:46,800
We'll ask him to spend
that time investigating.

494
00:41:46,867 --> 00:41:50,667
And if he does catch the Subway Ghost,
that would be a jackpot.

495
00:41:50,734 --> 00:41:52,533
Isn't that right, Officer Jeon?

496
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,500
Yes, it will be a jackpot.

497
00:41:54,567 --> 00:41:56,567
We're transferring Captain Ko
to Narang Island

498
00:41:56,633 --> 00:41:59,433
to promote the police anyway.

499
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:03,600
What better PR is there
than him catching the Subway Ghost?

500
00:42:03,667 --> 00:42:04,767
But...

501
00:42:04,834 --> 00:42:06,967
This decision was made
by the higher-ups already...

502
00:42:07,033 --> 00:42:09,266
It'd be a bigger problem
if the public found out

503
00:42:09,333 --> 00:42:12,333
that the higher-ups sent
a competent detective who caught

504
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,734
the Subway Ghost to an island
to be a straw man.

505
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,266
Can you stop the reporters
from writing articles on that?

506
00:42:17,333 --> 00:42:18,200
No.

507
00:42:21,266 --> 00:42:24,200
So will you give us a chance?

508
00:42:24,266 --> 00:42:25,100
Yes, do it.

509
00:42:26,133 --> 00:42:27,867
I'm sure you can do it.

510
00:42:27,934 --> 00:42:28,934
A week?

511
00:42:30,266 --> 00:42:33,400
If you're desperate,
that will be enough time.

512
00:42:34,133 --> 00:42:35,433
Thank you, ma'am!

513
00:42:36,233 --> 00:42:37,166
Thank you.

514
00:42:43,467 --> 00:42:46,333
Captain, meet me
at the Subway Police office.

515
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,233
Goodness.

516
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:51,767
I hate coming here now.

517
00:42:51,834 --> 00:42:53,633
No one is here to welcome us.

518
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,600
It's so empty.

519
00:42:55,667 --> 00:42:57,133
Detective Lee. Su-ho.

520
00:43:00,233 --> 00:43:02,633
Captain!

521
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:04,233
-Goodness.
-Captain.

522
00:43:08,233 --> 00:43:12,266
Are you not going to the island anymore?

523
00:43:12,333 --> 00:43:14,433
No, I'm just here to see you.

524
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,066
I'm here.

525
00:43:18,166 --> 00:43:19,700
What are you doing here?

526
00:43:19,767 --> 00:43:23,767
We won't take away your desk,
so go focus on working for the RIU.

527
00:43:23,834 --> 00:43:26,633
I won't work with them anymore.

528
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:27,900
-Why not?
-Were you kicked out?

529
00:43:27,967 --> 00:43:29,066
Did you cause trouble?

530
00:43:29,133 --> 00:43:31,433
What? No.

531
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:32,800
I quit of my own accord.

532
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:37,533
I've quit to catch the last one
of the Locust Swarm with Captain.

533
00:43:38,967 --> 00:43:41,333
You mean the Subway Ghost?

534
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,066
I made a deal with the commissioner.

535
00:43:44,033 --> 00:43:46,233
If we catch the Subway Ghost
within a week,

536
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:48,400
you will be reinstated
to the Subway Police.

537
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:51,934
I did a good job, right?

538
00:43:59,066 --> 00:44:00,200
Captain.

539
00:44:00,266 --> 00:44:01,266
Come with me.

540
00:44:18,567 --> 00:44:19,967
Thank you for coming.

541
00:44:25,233 --> 00:44:28,066
I like you a lot.

542
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,467
I can't hide my feelings anymore.

543
00:44:33,367 --> 00:44:37,066
I can only be my true self
when I'm around you.

544
00:44:47,033 --> 00:44:48,233
But...

545
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:51,133
Give your answer once we catch him.

546
00:44:55,233 --> 00:44:59,967
To be honest,
I want us to be official right now,

547
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:03,000
but that would be selfish of me.

548
00:45:05,333 --> 00:45:07,934
I know that you can't do anything else
until you catch him.

549
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:13,400
So give me your answer after we catch him.

550
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,000
Oh, that scared me.

551
00:45:19,066 --> 00:45:20,333
Are you all right?

552
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,400
Oh, my heart is racing.

553
00:45:23,166 --> 00:45:24,967
Why is my heart racing?

554
00:45:25,934 --> 00:45:27,066
Oh, my.

555
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:31,667
We'll go work undercover.

556
00:45:31,734 --> 00:45:34,467
We're going far away.
It'll take a long time.

557
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,300
-Hey.
-Okay, Father.

558
00:45:40,233 --> 00:45:42,400
I miss Donna so much.

559
00:45:50,834 --> 00:45:53,600
This isn't my desk now.

560
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:00,233
So we should go catch
the Locust Swarm now?

561
00:46:02,033 --> 00:46:04,767
Yes. Within a week.

562
00:46:04,834 --> 00:46:08,200
Oh, we must hurry.

563
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:10,300
Then first...

564
00:46:14,266 --> 00:46:15,100
Rookie.

565
00:46:18,667 --> 00:46:20,900
We should've just made it official today.

566
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:23,233
No way.

567
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:31,934
All right. Let's start investigating.

568
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,300
So we're going after the Locust Swarm,
not the Subway Ghost, right?

569
00:46:38,367 --> 00:46:41,233
The Subway Police knows
the Locust Swarm the best.

570
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:43,200
Okay. Then let's call in our family.

571
00:46:44,767 --> 00:46:46,734
<i>Detective Lee.
Are you done with your coffee?</i>

572
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:47,834
I just opened it.

573
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:50,533
Come back. Let's start investigating
the Locust Swarm.

574
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:54,200
Gosh, one week?
We should pour everything into it.

575
00:46:54,266 --> 00:46:58,367
Gosh, Ms. Yoo. What was the great idea
of yours that got you cut a deal

576
00:46:58,433 --> 00:47:00,433
with the commissioner?

577
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:01,834
Okay!

578
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:03,066
Gather around.

579
00:47:04,033 --> 00:47:08,767
He was chased by the police once,
so I'm sure he's completely in hiding.

580
00:47:08,834 --> 00:47:11,100
I thought it'd be impossible
to investigate his acquaintances

581
00:47:11,166 --> 00:47:13,700
because his identity is fake.

582
00:47:13,767 --> 00:47:14,600
But?

583
00:47:14,667 --> 00:47:16,500
Remember how Captain and I

584
00:47:16,567 --> 00:47:18,567
went after Han Tae-ung
at Seolleung Station?

585
00:47:19,567 --> 00:47:20,500
Yes.

586
00:47:20,567 --> 00:47:23,867
That day, Han Tae-ung was meeting
someone at Seolleung Station.

587
00:47:24,567 --> 00:47:27,500
Whom do you think he went to meet?

588
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:31,600
Of course, he must've gone
to meet his fence.

589
00:47:32,934 --> 00:47:35,734
Yes! That fence.

590
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:39,266
You're saying he's
Han Tae-ung's acquaintance, right?

591
00:47:39,333 --> 00:47:40,500
That's right.

592
00:47:40,567 --> 00:47:44,600
Captain, you told me before
that handling stolen goods is quite risky,

593
00:47:44,667 --> 00:47:46,934
so they usually make
the younger ones handle it.

594
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,367
So I thought Han Tae-ung
was one of the lower-rank minions.

595
00:47:50,433 --> 00:47:53,567
But now we know
that Han Tae-ung was the leader.

596
00:47:53,633 --> 00:47:54,900
You're right.

597
00:47:54,967 --> 00:47:57,066
If the leader went to handle
the stolen goods himself,

598
00:47:57,133 --> 00:47:59,100
it means he's friends with the fence.

599
00:47:59,166 --> 00:48:01,800
Since the fence definitely had contact
with Han Tae-ung,

600
00:48:02,667 --> 00:48:04,500
it is well worth it to talk to him.

601
00:48:04,567 --> 00:48:07,767
-Right?
-Gosh, Ms. Yoo.

602
00:48:07,834 --> 00:48:10,700
You've become smart
after working with the RIU.

603
00:48:12,166 --> 00:48:15,000
But do you think we can find him?

604
00:48:15,066 --> 00:48:18,567
Ms. Yoo, there are
a little over 100 fences

605
00:48:18,633 --> 00:48:20,734
on the Subway Police's radar.

606
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,166
It'll take time,

607
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:24,433
but if we question them one by one,
we'll find him.

608
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:28,533
Then I'll call the other Subway Police
and get the list of the fences.

609
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:29,600
Salute!

610
00:48:30,633 --> 00:48:34,900
All right.
Let's talk to every fence on the list.

611
00:48:34,967 --> 00:48:35,800
That's all!

612
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:51,400
Oh, come on. It's not me.

613
00:48:51,467 --> 00:48:53,600
I live a hard life,
so don't ever come here again.

614
00:48:53,667 --> 00:48:55,166
Don't come.

615
00:48:55,233 --> 00:48:57,400
-Hey. Come on.
-All right.

616
00:48:57,467 --> 00:49:00,133
Why do you cause a scene at every house?

617
00:49:01,633 --> 00:49:03,533
That never happened.

618
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:07,834
-Oh, come on.
-Jeez.

619
00:49:09,166 --> 00:49:10,567
I guess it's not him. Cross him off.

620
00:49:10,633 --> 00:49:11,567
Go away!

621
00:49:33,367 --> 00:49:34,967
Goodness.

622
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:39,333
That's not how you do it.
This is how you do it.

623
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:41,333
You should do it like a chicken.

624
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,100
You were good the other day.

625
00:49:45,533 --> 00:49:47,300
Let's go.

626
00:49:47,367 --> 00:49:48,467
Okay.

627
00:49:55,567 --> 00:49:58,900
I don't know anything.
I quit doing that a long time ago.

628
00:49:58,967 --> 00:50:01,300
Who is he? Is he terrifying?

629
00:50:01,367 --> 00:50:03,133
I really don't know.

630
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,600
You have to be truthful
for me to believe you.

631
00:50:07,066 --> 00:50:11,633
You said you quit this a long time ago,
but this is a stolen good, and so is that.

632
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:12,533
What?

633
00:50:15,333 --> 00:50:17,900
I'm sure you removed the initials
because this isn't yours.

634
00:50:17,967 --> 00:50:19,500
You don't strike me as someone

635
00:50:19,567 --> 00:50:22,300
who would put a heart sticker
on a pink cell phone.

636
00:50:22,367 --> 00:50:24,934
If you cooperate with us now,

637
00:50:25,834 --> 00:50:28,800
I'll give these back to the owners
and not hold you accountable.

638
00:50:28,867 --> 00:50:29,734
Or...

639
00:50:30,633 --> 00:50:32,867
I'll investigate this properly

640
00:50:32,934 --> 00:50:37,367
and make you serve
about seven years in prison.

641
00:50:38,233 --> 00:50:39,967
Oh, you're an ex-con, too.

642
00:50:40,033 --> 00:50:42,200
Then you'll get additional punishment.

643
00:50:42,266 --> 00:50:44,166
Maybe you'll get as long as ten years.

644
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:52,333
Promise me that you won't punish me
for what I'm about to tell you.

645
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:53,533
What else did you do?

646
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:56,734
Okay. Just tell us
who the Locust Swarm's fence is.

647
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,900
That fence has a talent.

648
00:51:01,967 --> 00:51:04,266
-What talent?
-Laundering identities.

649
00:51:06,266 --> 00:51:08,900
That fence makes fake IDs
and fake passports

650
00:51:08,967 --> 00:51:11,533
with the ID cards from stolen wallets.

651
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:13,500
They are flawless.

652
00:51:13,567 --> 00:51:18,000
We all have gotten fake IDs
from that fence.

653
00:51:18,066 --> 00:51:22,166
Since we are all involved,
no one will talk.

654
00:51:22,233 --> 00:51:23,567
The identity of Han Tae-ung

655
00:51:24,734 --> 00:51:26,233
could've been fabricated by that fence.

656
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:31,200
He'll need a new ID to run away,
so those two will meet again.

657
00:51:33,467 --> 00:51:36,433
Where can we find that fence?

658
00:51:39,767 --> 00:51:41,266
{\an8}JI HAN-SEOP

659
00:52:03,333 --> 00:52:04,166
What do you want?

660
00:52:06,133 --> 00:52:07,300
Who are you?

661
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:09,467
-Damn it.
-Stay still!

662
00:52:10,166 --> 00:52:11,166
Jeez.

663
00:52:11,233 --> 00:52:12,834
We're the police.

664
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:14,967
-Let go of me!
-Stay still.

665
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:18,633
What kind of police barges
into someone else's house

666
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:20,400
without even identifying himself?

667
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:22,734
I'm a good cop,

668
00:52:23,834 --> 00:52:25,567
but I don't want to be one right now.

669
00:52:27,333 --> 00:52:31,467
Gosh, she's good. They look so real.

670
00:52:33,433 --> 00:52:34,700
Damn it.

671
00:52:34,767 --> 00:52:35,834
Listen up.

672
00:52:36,567 --> 00:52:38,567
As a cop,

673
00:52:38,633 --> 00:52:42,200
I should take all those IDs
to the station,

674
00:52:42,266 --> 00:52:45,600
investigate who those people are,

675
00:52:45,667 --> 00:52:50,166
and write up every single one
and indict you.

676
00:52:50,934 --> 00:52:53,433
I would have to work hard
for at least a week.

677
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:55,667
-So?
-But...

678
00:52:57,233 --> 00:52:59,934
I don't have the time
nor the will to do so.

679
00:53:00,967 --> 00:53:03,100
So I'll just ask you
one question and leave.

680
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:05,467
What's that?

681
00:53:05,533 --> 00:53:07,500
The Locust Swarm's leader, Han Tae-ung.

682
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:11,734
What's his real name?
Where can we find him?

683
00:53:15,133 --> 00:53:17,533
This...

684
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,467
If we decide to investigate this,

685
00:53:19,533 --> 00:53:24,033
you'll be sentenced
to 30 years in prison for forgery.

686
00:53:25,967 --> 00:53:29,400
Oh, right. You're an ex-con, too, right?

687
00:53:29,467 --> 00:53:31,467
Then you'll get additional punishment.

688
00:53:31,533 --> 00:53:36,066
You'll end up spending
about four decades in prison.

689
00:53:36,133 --> 00:53:37,233
Oh, no.

690
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:39,800
He's just one of my clients.

691
00:53:42,567 --> 00:53:46,800
I don't know his real name,
so go ask him yourself.

692
00:53:46,867 --> 00:53:48,500
You know how to get in touch with him?

693
00:53:48,567 --> 00:53:51,000
I'm supposed to meet him
at Hwagok Station in 30 minutes.

694
00:53:51,066 --> 00:53:54,533
He's coming to Hwagok Station
in 30 minutes?

695
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:55,533
Let's go, Rookie.

696
00:54:09,567 --> 00:54:10,567
Chief Ha!

697
00:54:13,467 --> 00:54:17,166
The DNA on these cigarette butts
match the Subway Ghost's DNA.

698
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:19,433
What?

699
00:54:23,133 --> 00:54:23,967
DNA ANALYSIS

700
00:54:24,033 --> 00:54:24,967
What?

701
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:27,667
So he really did go
to Officer Yoo's place?

702
00:54:27,734 --> 00:54:29,266
I didn't think he would.

703
00:54:29,333 --> 00:54:32,233
It's risky to go
to a cop's place on his own

704
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:33,734
while he's on the run.

705
00:54:34,567 --> 00:54:37,300
Why is he going that extra mile?

706
00:54:39,633 --> 00:54:42,266
What is he trying to say?

707
00:54:46,633 --> 00:54:47,600
What is it?

708
00:54:47,667 --> 00:54:50,767
The Subway Ghost will be
at Hwagok Station in 30 minutes.

709
00:54:50,834 --> 00:54:52,100
How do you know that?

710
00:54:52,166 --> 00:54:53,333
It's a long story.

711
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,934
I'm sure about this, so be on the move.

712
00:54:58,500 --> 00:54:59,333
Okay.

713
00:55:02,133 --> 00:55:04,834
The Subway Ghost will be
at Hwagok Station.

714
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:05,967
Let's go right now.

715
00:55:06,033 --> 00:55:07,333
Okay!

716
00:55:19,266 --> 00:55:21,233
The train bound for Banghwa is this way.

717
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:38,300
-Let's search here.
-Okay.

718
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:43,400
Where is he?

719
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:48,734
<i>This train is for Banghwa.</i>

720
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:31,667
He got off on the other side.

721
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,100
Rookie!

722
00:57:02,166 --> 00:57:03,100
-Rookie.
-Over there.

723
00:57:14,734 --> 00:57:15,567
Jin.

724
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:19,300
This is Jin's.

725
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:22,200
I'll go get him.

726
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:46,967
Move.

727
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:57,066
I got you.

728
00:59:42,834 --> 00:59:43,700
Jin...

729
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:47,133
Where is she?

730
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:01,800
Your sister...

731
01:00:06,867 --> 01:00:08,100
She's alive.

732
01:00:59,467 --> 01:01:01,033
CATCH THE GHOST

733
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,500
<i>-Happy birthday to you
-She's alive.</i>

734
01:01:03,567 --> 01:01:06,567
<i>-Happy birthday, dear Jin
-Just focus on that.</i>

735
01:01:06,633 --> 01:01:08,400
I'm a witness,

736
01:01:08,934 --> 01:01:10,300
<i>not a murderer.</i>

737
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:12,266
Stop with your lies.

738
01:01:12,333 --> 01:01:14,066
You killed her!

739
01:01:14,133 --> 01:01:16,667
<i>A mentally-ill homeless person
pushed a child</i>

740
01:01:16,734 --> 01:01:18,934
<i>-onto the tracks at Wangsuri Station.</i>
-Quiet!

741
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,133
I was so scared
that I couldn't say anything.

742
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:24,834
<i>It will never happen again.</i>

743
01:01:24,934 --> 01:01:26,500
Tell me what's going on.

744
01:01:27,333 --> 01:01:28,700
It's Jin's fault.
