00:00:21,451 --> 00:00:22,896
(Episode 11)

4
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,995
Ryung had just one family member.

5
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:32,936
Her twin sister who had autism.

6
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,136
A twin sister?

7
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,475
I never knew.

8
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:40,325
But that sister...

9
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:45,595
was murdered by the Subway Ghost.

10
00:00:49,191 --> 00:00:52,135
She took care of her by herself
ever since they were 10.

11
00:00:52,431 --> 00:00:54,976
She never had a life of her own.

12
00:00:56,301 --> 00:00:59,016
Her sister, for whom she
sacrificed her life went missing,

13
00:00:59,341 --> 00:01:00,885
but the police ignored her.

14
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:03,116
But if the police look away,

15
00:01:04,111 --> 00:01:05,316
those families...

16
00:01:06,881 --> 00:01:09,011
will be tormented all their lives.

17
00:01:09,011 --> 00:01:10,696
You want to join this department...

18
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:14,366
and memorized every corner
of every subway line...

19
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:15,926
Why did you memorize them?

20
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:20,295
She didn't eat or sleep and walked
until her feet blistered up.

21
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:22,735
Eventually,

22
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,905
she memorized everything,
down to where every vending machine was.

23
00:01:33,341 --> 00:01:34,446
I want...

24
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:38,086
to stay by your side.

25
00:01:40,511 --> 00:01:41,625
But...

26
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:44,995
if I stay by your side,

27
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,196
I keep wanting to depend on you.

28
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:56,666
(Seoun Metropolitan Police Agency)

29
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,979
Maybe she wants to join Metro.

30
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:14,980
My point exactly.

31
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:18,096
She must not feel anything looking
at her dead sister's pictures.

32
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,996
If you're done putting them up,
return this to the file room.

33
00:02:26,421 --> 00:02:28,831
And write down the details regarding
the victim Yoo Jin's actions...

34
00:02:28,831 --> 00:02:30,566
on the day of the incident by time.

35
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:32,735
Yes, ma'am.

36
00:02:51,581 --> 00:02:52,656
Ji Seok.

37
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:03,036
Is that...

38
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,506
Is that dead woman...

39
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:09,346
Officer Yoo's sister?

40
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:14,515
Yes.

41
00:03:16,671 --> 00:03:17,756
Ma Ri.

42
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,925
But putting those up like that...

43
00:03:22,051 --> 00:03:23,925
is a bit cruel to her.

44
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:25,526
Cruel?

45
00:03:28,491 --> 00:03:30,526
And you think you're not being cruel?

46
00:03:36,461 --> 00:03:38,376
I'll take that as the answer...

47
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:40,906
I was waiting to hear from you.

48
00:03:42,401 --> 00:03:44,246
If you're done here, please leave.

49
00:03:44,271 --> 00:03:45,746
And Officer Yoo...

50
00:03:47,371 --> 00:03:50,716
isn't your newbie anymore,
so stop telling me what to do.

51
00:03:52,111 --> 00:03:53,585
Don't you feel sorry for her?

52
00:03:53,711 --> 00:03:55,181
Hey, Ko Ji Seok!

53
00:03:55,181 --> 00:03:57,055
You said you pretended not to know.

54
00:03:57,451 --> 00:03:58,726
You're doing this...

55
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,820
because you're sorry.

56
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,166
Stop it.

57
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,096
I'm trying my best...

58
00:04:05,591 --> 00:04:08,906
to behave myself in front
of you two right now.

59
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:11,805
You probably don't know what I mean.

60
00:04:16,331 --> 00:04:17,670
It's better not to know.

61
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:18,976
What does that mean?

62
00:04:20,201 --> 00:04:22,811
- Tell me.
- I can't stand this any longer.

63
00:04:22,811 --> 00:04:26,255
Are you trying to tell us
we're the cruel ones right now?

64
00:04:28,451 --> 00:04:30,055
Here, take a good look.

65
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:32,495
See for yourself who is really cruel.

66
00:04:43,591 --> 00:04:45,505
I don't feel sorry for her...

67
00:04:45,961 --> 00:04:47,445
nor am I sorry.

68
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:51,416
So you should stop pitying her too.

69
00:04:51,441 --> 00:04:53,516
Since this is who she really is.

70
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,166
I don't pity her.

71
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:16,605
Do you know why I couldn't tell you...

72
00:05:17,961 --> 00:05:19,836
the real reason we broke up?

73
00:05:21,331 --> 00:05:22,976
Even if the whole world...

74
00:05:23,831 --> 00:05:25,875
knew how much of a loser I was,

75
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,745
I didn't want you to know.

76
00:05:30,841 --> 00:05:32,185
Because...

77
00:05:33,011 --> 00:05:36,355
if you left me after knowing the
truth, it would hurt more...

78
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:40,995
than you leaving without knowing anything.

79
00:05:43,021 --> 00:05:45,065
Although I was all grown up,

80
00:05:45,561 --> 00:05:47,706
after hearing my mom had Alzheimer's,

81
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,435
I gave up on everything.

82
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:52,605
My dream...

83
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:55,146
and you as well.

84
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,945
Everyone becomes a loser during hard times.

85
00:06:00,841 --> 00:06:02,685
And it takes time...

86
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,485
to overcome that.

87
00:06:06,211 --> 00:06:08,610
You sacrificed yourself for your mom...

88
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:10,511
and she just ran away for her own sake.

89
00:06:10,511 --> 00:06:11,951
How could that be the same?

90
00:06:11,951 --> 00:06:13,055
Sacrifice...

91
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,946
could have been the
justification that I hid behind.

92
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:21,155
Because it's hard.

93
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:24,626
Thinking that this was
the only thing I could do.

94
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,386
It could've been self-justification.

95
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,365
Even a grown-up like me
crumbled down like that.

96
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:37,436
But Newbie had to look after
her sister when she was 10.

97
00:06:42,261 --> 00:06:43,836
At that moment, she just...

98
00:06:46,131 --> 00:06:47,646
acted like a loser...

99
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:51,785
because it was too hard.

100
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:54,415
And she didn't want...

101
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,126
anyone she cared about to
see her act like a loser.

102
00:06:59,381 --> 00:07:01,155
I don't pity her.

103
00:07:04,551 --> 00:07:05,795
I just...

104
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,136
understand her.

105
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,751
Goodness. Darn it!

106
00:07:37,751 --> 00:07:38,790
I'm sorry.

107
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,326
Why are you even here?

108
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,766
This isn't a place for
someone like you. Got it?

109
00:07:47,061 --> 00:07:48,836
Don't ever touch her again.

110
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:53,605
Let's go.

111
00:09:05,741 --> 00:09:07,570
I'll leave this here.

112
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:10,810
This belongs to the Subway Police.
It's not mine anymore.

113
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:12,586
No, thanks. It's yours.

114
00:09:15,581 --> 00:09:19,326
I mean, it's all right,
since we can take the subway.

115
00:09:23,861 --> 00:09:26,530
I'll be going then.

116
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:27,836
Okay.

117
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:33,446
Do you want some instant noodles?

118
00:09:34,871 --> 00:09:35,946
What?

119
00:09:37,241 --> 00:09:40,611
It's just... You seem hungry...

120
00:09:40,611 --> 00:09:43,810
and I think I heard your stomach growling.

121
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:45,025
When we were on the motorcycle?

122
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:50,680
Yes. Where was it?
I think it was around Yangwha Bridge...

123
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,995
- I'm not sure.
- When we were crossing the bridge?

124
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:56,166
I was starving,
and I was literally in tears.

125
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,036
Eggs...

126
00:09:58,131 --> 00:09:59,261
Eggs?

127
00:09:59,261 --> 00:10:01,005
Do you have eggs?

128
00:10:02,261 --> 00:10:03,676
You have eggs?

129
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,145
Yes...

130
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,615
Oh, no.

131
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:14,910
It's the top floor.

132
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,686
- Oh, the top floor?
- Yes.

133
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:27,525
Is she hiding something
precious in there or what?

134
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,765
Leaving me waiting outside like this.

135
00:10:39,971 --> 00:10:41,375
Here you go.

136
00:10:46,011 --> 00:10:47,716
Ta-da!

137
00:10:48,341 --> 00:10:51,056
This is the best place in
Seoul to eat instant noodles.

138
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,625
Well then... Thank you for the meal!

139
00:11:07,261 --> 00:11:08,505
Is it good?

140
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:18,015
By the way, when did you steal my key?

141
00:11:21,641 --> 00:11:26,426
I mean, I'm certain I
had it hooked on my belt,

142
00:11:26,981 --> 00:11:28,450
when and how did you take it?

143
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:32,296
I didn't take it off of you while
you were asleep, so don't worry.

144
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,960
That key just...

145
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:37,635
flew across the air like this...

146
00:11:39,631 --> 00:11:41,005
and landed...

147
00:11:41,731 --> 00:11:42,761
right in front of me.

148
00:11:42,761 --> 00:11:44,361
You're such a liar.

149
00:11:44,361 --> 00:11:45,601
I mean it.

150
00:11:45,601 --> 00:11:49,076
Your lying has even improved,
always trying to deceive me.

151
00:11:49,371 --> 00:11:53,046
It flew across the air?
Your lies are mind-boggling now.

152
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,125
I'm really sorry.

153
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:02,156
Don't worry about it.

154
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:07,225
Anyone can lie in urgent situations.

155
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:09,566
It's better than not doing anything...

156
00:12:11,121 --> 00:12:12,436
like an idiot.

157
00:12:13,631 --> 00:12:16,076
I'll make sure you get reinstated...

158
00:12:16,631 --> 00:12:18,546
and try anything...

159
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:27,586
- Beer?
- Sure!

160
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:33,611
That's a week's worth of beer,

161
00:12:33,611 --> 00:12:35,995
but I'll share it with
you since you forgave me.

162
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,789
All right.

163
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:41,395
Since someone told me...

164
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,436
this is the best place
in Seoul to drink beer.

165
00:12:46,731 --> 00:12:48,105
Here you go.

166
00:12:53,331 --> 00:12:55,615
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

167
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,755
You know last time...

168
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,150
If I think about that time...

169
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,150
How could I know about it?

170
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,826
You should always stay alert.

171
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,895
What an amazing view.

172
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,656
I don't know...

173
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,225
if it's okay to ask you this, but...

174
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:42,225
- What is it?
- I heard...

175
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,426
you memorize everything down to the
locations of vending machines...

176
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,666
because you walked around...

177
00:13:49,091 --> 00:13:51,296
the stations so much
looking for your sister.

178
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,375
Is that true?

179
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,275
It was better than...

180
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:03,076
being home alone.

181
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:40,505
That's not true. You didn't let go
because you wanted to abandon her.

182
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:42,645
There was another reason.

183
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:45,245
Tell them. They're getting the wrong idea.

184
00:15:48,741 --> 00:15:49,916
She just acted like a loser...

185
00:15:51,611 --> 00:15:53,156
because it was too hard.

186
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,180
And it takes time to overcome that.

187
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,296
And she didn't want...

188
00:16:00,221 --> 00:16:02,466
anyone she cared about to
see her act like a loser.

189
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,806
I don't pity her.

190
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:09,505
I just...

191
00:16:12,331 --> 00:16:13,446
understand her.

192
00:16:14,871 --> 00:16:16,216
You're cool, Ji Seok.

193
00:16:24,511 --> 00:16:26,726
(Subway Ghost Evidence)

194
00:16:52,141 --> 00:16:55,586
Do you know why I couldn't tell
you the real reason we broke up?

195
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,786
Because...

196
00:16:59,881 --> 00:17:02,956
if you left me after knowing the
truth, it would hurt more...

197
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:07,466
than you leaving without knowing anything.

198
00:17:30,611 --> 00:17:31,755
Fine,

199
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:33,785
I'm the cruel one.

200
00:17:51,831 --> 00:17:52,946
Hold on.

201
00:18:06,981 --> 00:18:11,866
(Where Hwang Soo Young's body was found)

202
00:18:15,691 --> 00:18:18,306
(Where Hwang Soo Young went missing)

203
00:18:22,031 --> 00:18:23,235
(Where Hwang Soo Young's body was found)

204
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,330
(Janghanpyeong)

205
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:26,905
(Gwanghwamun, Yeouido, Singil)

206
00:18:28,031 --> 00:18:30,076
(Hwang Soo Young, Park Ji Yun,
Choi Jin Kang, Kim Min Jae)

207
00:19:37,998 --> 00:19:39,242
When did I come in?

208
00:19:40,167 --> 00:19:41,843
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

209
00:19:42,238 --> 00:19:44,413
Chief, we'll be forever...

210
00:19:55,467 --> 00:19:56,643
Did he see it?

211
00:20:15,417 --> 00:20:16,592
Where are you going?

212
00:20:16,658 --> 00:20:19,203
I'm so late... I should get to work.

213
00:20:25,527 --> 00:20:27,102
Where are you going?

214
00:20:45,217 --> 00:20:46,623
Why is this here?

215
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:09,413
I'm not saying don't look at it.

216
00:21:10,777 --> 00:21:12,082
But close this at times...

217
00:21:15,777 --> 00:21:17,223
and look at yourself.

218
00:21:23,118 --> 00:21:25,663
I bought some rice and side dishes.

219
00:21:25,727 --> 00:21:28,802
Don't just eat cup noodles.
Eat rice once in a while.

220
00:21:33,398 --> 00:21:35,242
Let's go. I'll drop you off.

221
00:22:02,658 --> 00:22:05,102
(Welcome! Working to keep citizens safe)

222
00:22:25,187 --> 00:22:27,187
That victim, Yoo Jin.

223
00:22:27,187 --> 00:22:29,292
You didn't find a wallet or anything, right?

224
00:22:30,118 --> 00:22:31,588
No, we didn't.

225
00:22:31,588 --> 00:22:34,163
Maybe we should check that tunnel again.

226
00:22:34,658 --> 00:22:36,726
I doubt we'll find anything.

227
00:22:36,727 --> 00:22:38,302
Isn't she dead?

228
00:22:38,667 --> 00:22:41,443
I know. I wonder if we'll find anything.

229
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:58,863
Are you two dating now?

230
00:23:01,017 --> 00:23:02,163
Not yet.

231
00:23:04,517 --> 00:23:05,863
I didn't ask her yet.

232
00:23:05,927 --> 00:23:08,802
Then why are you holding her hand?

233
00:23:10,427 --> 00:23:13,403
It's just that the Metro
guys are such jerks.

234
00:23:13,427 --> 00:23:15,342
Newbie looked uncomfortable.

235
00:23:15,937 --> 00:23:17,312
I wanted to take her to the office.

236
00:23:20,308 --> 00:23:22,483
If someone swears at you
or shoves you around,

237
00:23:22,707 --> 00:23:24,483
call me right away.

238
00:23:25,408 --> 00:23:27,983
You can tell me first since
I'm right next to you.

239
00:23:31,277 --> 00:23:32,693
You didn't ask, did you?

240
00:23:33,818 --> 00:23:35,193
And she didn't answer.

241
00:23:35,417 --> 00:23:36,733
Are you going to the office?

242
00:23:38,017 --> 00:23:39,233
Let's go.

243
00:23:41,658 --> 00:23:43,328
Why are you so tall?

244
00:23:43,328 --> 00:23:45,102
Goodbye, Chief.

245
00:23:47,798 --> 00:23:49,113
Darn it.

246
00:23:49,437 --> 00:23:51,113
That jerk, Woo Hyuk.

247
00:24:03,017 --> 00:24:04,953
Good morning, everyone!

248
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:07,723
Good morning!

249
00:24:17,598 --> 00:24:20,598
We didn't find any DNA
from the clothing or shoes.

250
00:24:20,598 --> 00:24:23,598
Still, since we found DNA
from the piece of cloth...

251
00:24:23,598 --> 00:24:24,936
that Officer Yoo found in the tunnel,

252
00:24:24,937 --> 00:24:27,108
we can compare it when we find a suspect.

253
00:24:27,108 --> 00:24:28,183
That day,

254
00:24:28,838 --> 00:24:31,352
the perp was about to kill
you, but he stopped.

255
00:24:33,177 --> 00:24:35,252
Then he left this piece of cloth behind.

256
00:24:35,417 --> 00:24:37,522
There was something he wanted to say.

257
00:24:39,417 --> 00:24:41,062
A dress was torn.

258
00:24:41,747 --> 00:24:44,032
And he let someone find it.

259
00:24:44,818 --> 00:24:46,532
Why do you think so?

260
00:24:48,288 --> 00:24:51,133
"You tore my dress. Pay me back."

261
00:24:52,128 --> 00:24:53,703
Don't you think it'd be something like this?

262
00:24:55,128 --> 00:24:57,772
The person the Subway Ghost targeted...

263
00:24:58,197 --> 00:24:59,443
was Yoo Jin.

264
00:24:59,808 --> 00:25:03,308
He must've had a grudge
against her to kill her.

265
00:25:03,308 --> 00:25:06,653
And Yoo Ryung was after him...

266
00:25:06,707 --> 00:25:08,522
Are you saying my sister
is also responsible...

267
00:25:08,777 --> 00:25:10,548
for the serial killings?

268
00:25:10,548 --> 00:25:14,123
If the DNA from that torn piece of cloth...

269
00:25:14,217 --> 00:25:18,363
and your sister's DNA match,
my assumption will be proven.

270
00:25:19,328 --> 00:25:21,602
Identical twins have the same DNA.

271
00:25:21,957 --> 00:25:23,733
Let's compare them then.

272
00:25:26,328 --> 00:25:27,403
Why?

273
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:30,572
Are you afraid your sister's
wrongdoings will be revealed?

274
00:25:31,338 --> 00:25:33,067
I guess your priority is
trying to hide things again...

275
00:25:33,068 --> 00:25:35,143
instead of trying to catch the perp.

276
00:25:35,638 --> 00:25:36,777
Lieutenant.

277
00:25:36,777 --> 00:25:38,312
You can take my DNA.

278
00:25:44,917 --> 00:25:47,322
Let's talk later when the results come out.

279
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:52,227
(Wanted Subway Pickpocket Suspects)

280
00:25:52,227 --> 00:25:54,163
These are 200 wanted posters.

281
00:25:54,558 --> 00:25:56,297
Don't put these up on the wall.

282
00:25:56,298 --> 00:25:58,943
Hand them out to the passengers
of Wangsoori Station...

283
00:25:59,227 --> 00:26:00,572
one by one.

284
00:26:00,727 --> 00:26:02,767
- Hand them out?
- What kind of officer...

285
00:26:02,767 --> 00:26:04,267
hands out flyers?

286
00:26:04,267 --> 00:26:06,467
If necessary, we can request
help from the duty police.

287
00:26:06,467 --> 00:26:08,683
You said you wanted to catch
the man who killed your sister.

288
00:26:09,608 --> 00:26:11,582
You want to find her body at least.

289
00:26:13,007 --> 00:26:14,752
Then you should do everything you can.

290
00:26:16,747 --> 00:26:18,118
Here you go.

291
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:19,193
(Wangsoori Station)

292
00:26:19,848 --> 00:26:21,017
Take this too.

293
00:26:21,017 --> 00:26:22,388
Thank you.

294
00:26:22,388 --> 00:26:24,017
- Detective Yoo.
- Hello.

295
00:26:24,017 --> 00:26:26,903
I didn't see you around these past few days.

296
00:26:27,288 --> 00:26:29,027
I don't work here anymore.

297
00:26:29,027 --> 00:26:30,272
What?

298
00:26:30,727 --> 00:26:33,772
Did you change your line of work?
Are we rivals now?

299
00:26:33,868 --> 00:26:37,742
These are wanted posters.
I need to hand them out.

300
00:26:37,937 --> 00:26:40,108
My gosh, no way.

301
00:26:40,108 --> 00:26:43,312
How could our country waste
someone's talent like this?

302
00:26:43,608 --> 00:26:46,108
You're the detective I respect the most.

303
00:26:46,108 --> 00:26:47,477
Stop flattering me.

304
00:26:47,477 --> 00:26:48,578
Give me those.

305
00:26:48,578 --> 00:26:50,177
Leave these with me,

306
00:26:50,177 --> 00:26:53,123
and you should go and catch
another bad guy when you can.

307
00:26:53,417 --> 00:26:55,118
It's okay, give them to me.

308
00:26:55,118 --> 00:26:56,417
- Just go.
- No.

309
00:26:56,417 --> 00:26:58,658
It's okay, don't worry about it.

310
00:26:58,658 --> 00:27:00,858
If you order a dish of spicy tripe,
you get a free rolled omelet.

311
00:27:00,858 --> 00:27:02,527
Thank you, sir.

312
00:27:02,527 --> 00:27:04,497
If you order a dish of spicy tripe,
you get a free rolled omelet.

313
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:06,167
Thank you very much.

314
00:27:06,167 --> 00:27:08,742
Thank you, sir.

315
00:27:09,638 --> 00:27:10,913
Here you go.

316
00:27:11,167 --> 00:27:12,308
I don't need it.

317
00:27:12,308 --> 00:27:13,767
- Ma'am.
- What?

318
00:27:13,767 --> 00:27:16,183
Can't we all just get along?

319
00:27:16,838 --> 00:27:18,848
What is wrong with you, lady?

320
00:27:18,848 --> 00:27:20,582
Be nice, ma'am.

321
00:27:23,318 --> 00:27:26,762
If you order a dish of spicy tripe,
you get a free rolled omelet.

322
00:27:29,217 --> 00:27:30,363
Captain.

323
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:33,532
You know, right?

324
00:27:33,927 --> 00:27:35,828
Who the murderer is among us.

325
00:27:35,828 --> 00:27:39,227
I don't know. I really... don't know.

326
00:27:39,227 --> 00:27:40,903
I know.

327
00:27:41,027 --> 00:27:43,542
It's Hyung Soo. Hyung Soo!

328
00:27:43,638 --> 00:27:45,298
It's that punk, Hyung Soo.

329
00:27:45,298 --> 00:27:46,483
What?

330
00:27:46,737 --> 00:27:50,737
You remember that stray dog
that used to bark every night?

331
00:27:50,737 --> 00:27:53,578
I woke up from my sleep one
time because of that noise.

332
00:27:53,578 --> 00:27:56,492
I woke up,
and I saw Hyung Soo sitting up too.

333
00:27:56,648 --> 00:27:59,592
And he had these strange eyes.

334
00:28:00,048 --> 00:28:02,022
Something looked murderous about them.

335
00:28:03,118 --> 00:28:06,562
Anyway, I asked him why he wasn't
sleeping, and he said,

336
00:28:07,858 --> 00:28:09,633
"Where is the knife?"

337
00:28:10,727 --> 00:28:12,427
He took the knife and went outside...

338
00:28:12,427 --> 00:28:15,502
And the dog didn't bark anymore?

339
00:28:16,237 --> 00:28:17,838
It's not that, is it?

340
00:28:17,838 --> 00:28:19,183
It is.

341
00:28:19,908 --> 00:28:22,007
But do you know what's even scarier?

342
00:28:22,007 --> 00:28:25,723
The next day,
Hyung Soo didn't remember anything.

343
00:28:26,808 --> 00:28:30,352
I think he becomes someone
else when he loses his mind.

344
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:32,717
That could be a murderer.

345
00:28:32,717 --> 00:28:34,163
Bong Man.

346
00:28:36,118 --> 00:28:37,893
We should talk about you first.

347
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:42,903
Since you've really killed someone.

348
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:52,308
Yes, this is Metro Detective Division.

349
00:28:52,308 --> 00:28:53,737
- This is Metro Detective Division.
- Yes, this is Team 1.

350
00:28:53,737 --> 00:28:55,538
- Yes, what is it?
- This is Metro Detective Division.

351
00:28:55,538 --> 00:28:57,408
- Yes?
- Where did you see him?

352
00:28:57,408 --> 00:29:00,282
He looked similar to the
person in the wanted poster?

353
00:29:00,808 --> 00:29:03,522
- Where was it?
- How tall was he?

354
00:29:03,848 --> 00:29:06,693
Could I please get your name?

355
00:29:06,818 --> 00:29:08,123
What happened to the tip?

356
00:29:09,058 --> 00:29:10,832
Some kids pulled a prank.

357
00:29:11,558 --> 00:29:14,658
We may have to leave the office
to check on incoming tips...

358
00:29:14,658 --> 00:29:17,903
so forward all your
calls to your cellphones.

359
00:29:18,328 --> 00:29:20,443
- Yes, ma'am.
- Okay.

360
00:29:22,398 --> 00:29:24,173
Your calls will be forwarded.

361
00:29:25,937 --> 00:29:29,638
Lieutenant. I received a tip,
so I'll go check it out now.

362
00:29:29,638 --> 00:29:31,683
I'll go. Tell me the address.

363
00:29:38,548 --> 00:29:41,923
You should take a short nap at least.
You'll faint at this rate.

364
00:29:45,828 --> 00:29:47,203
Yes, Madam Commissioner.

365
00:29:49,427 --> 00:29:53,203
You found the Subway Ghost's
hideout from an anonymous tip?

366
00:29:53,967 --> 00:29:57,038
Why did you hide the fact that
Officer Yoo made that tip?

367
00:29:57,038 --> 00:29:58,767
Were you jealous of her performance?

368
00:29:58,767 --> 00:30:00,143
Of course not.

369
00:30:01,638 --> 00:30:04,308
I just thought it would
put everyone in trouble.

370
00:30:04,308 --> 00:30:06,308
Why do you think...

371
00:30:06,308 --> 00:30:09,723
Officer Yoo did something that
would put everyone in trouble?

372
00:30:10,217 --> 00:30:11,417
That is...

373
00:30:11,417 --> 00:30:15,417
the part I cannot understand
at all about this incident.

374
00:30:15,417 --> 00:30:17,058
Why didn't Officer Yoo...

375
00:30:17,058 --> 00:30:20,233
request for support from the
Metro Detective Division?

376
00:30:23,927 --> 00:30:26,342
I know why. I didn't accept...

377
00:30:26,697 --> 00:30:28,398
her request for investigation support.

378
00:30:28,398 --> 00:30:30,898
Excluding Officer Yoo's sister
as a victim back then...

379
00:30:30,898 --> 00:30:32,937
was a reasonable decision as a detective.

380
00:30:32,937 --> 00:30:35,538
The lure pattern was different,
we didn't find a body,

381
00:30:35,538 --> 00:30:37,512
and her sister went missing, Officer Yoo...

382
00:30:38,677 --> 00:30:41,123
Even if all the evidence says no,

383
00:30:41,608 --> 00:30:44,653
Officer Yoo was so desperate.

384
00:30:46,517 --> 00:30:48,963
When I said I was proud of you before,

385
00:30:49,858 --> 00:30:52,502
I was speaking as a mom to her daughter.

386
00:30:53,328 --> 00:30:54,703
But today,

387
00:30:56,828 --> 00:30:58,802
my daughter has really...

388
00:31:00,398 --> 00:31:02,302
disappointed me.

389
00:31:13,177 --> 00:31:14,552
Darn.

390
00:31:19,118 --> 00:31:20,423
Captain.

391
00:31:20,687 --> 00:31:23,193
You know the Pyeonghae-dong Zombie Gang?

392
00:31:23,217 --> 00:31:24,658
They're notorious for being cruel.

393
00:31:24,658 --> 00:31:26,187
Zombie Gang?

394
00:31:26,187 --> 00:31:28,032
He was a member of that gang.

395
00:31:28,187 --> 00:31:30,633
I heard he was fighting
against another gang...

396
00:31:31,058 --> 00:31:32,328
and killed someone.

397
00:31:32,328 --> 00:31:34,373
What about that night when you
had that knife in your hand?

398
00:31:35,027 --> 00:31:36,973
- What was that?
- I know.

399
00:31:39,108 --> 00:31:41,183
I become someone else from time to time.

400
00:31:41,808 --> 00:31:43,282
But when I change,

401
00:31:43,808 --> 00:31:46,822
I become a teary, innocent,

402
00:31:46,908 --> 00:31:48,752
and young little boy.

403
00:31:49,417 --> 00:31:50,752
My mom told me.

404
00:31:51,947 --> 00:31:55,693
That night, I probably cut that dog's leash.

405
00:31:56,388 --> 00:31:57,893
That dog was whimpering...

406
00:31:58,687 --> 00:32:02,332
because its collar dug
into its skin all the time.

407
00:32:05,427 --> 00:32:06,643
Guys.

408
00:32:07,068 --> 00:32:08,868
Us turning against one another...

409
00:32:08,868 --> 00:32:11,342
is exactly what the police want us to do.

410
00:32:15,207 --> 00:32:18,012
Captain, I've found a boat.

411
00:32:18,707 --> 00:32:21,282
It's a smuggling boat headed
to China at 6am tomorrow.

412
00:32:22,007 --> 00:32:24,792
We're probably forbidden to fly anyway.

413
00:32:25,888 --> 00:32:28,163
- A boat is safer.
- Safe.

414
00:32:29,987 --> 00:32:31,233
Safety is important.

415
00:32:32,558 --> 00:32:35,933
Okay. It's too dangerous to wait here.

416
00:32:37,098 --> 00:32:39,342
Let's split up for the night
and meet up at the harbor...

417
00:32:40,298 --> 00:32:41,802
first thing in the morning.

418
00:33:17,438 --> 00:33:19,013
- What should we eat?
- Something spicy.

419
00:33:19,237 --> 00:33:21,412
- Spicy? Like chicken feet?
- That sounds good.

420
00:33:21,908 --> 00:33:23,283
Sorry.

421
00:33:30,147 --> 00:33:32,522
Buying refrigerators.

422
00:33:32,848 --> 00:33:34,493
Refrigerators,

423
00:33:34,918 --> 00:33:36,392
washing machines,

424
00:33:36,788 --> 00:33:38,062
stereos...

425
00:33:38,458 --> 00:33:41,562
Buying used household goods.

426
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:43,533
Buying stereos,

427
00:33:44,098 --> 00:33:45,972
broken pianos,

428
00:33:46,467 --> 00:33:48,502
and used books.

429
00:33:49,538 --> 00:33:51,642
Buying refrigerators.

430
00:33:52,297 --> 00:33:53,843
Refrigerators...

431
00:34:05,618 --> 00:34:07,722
And used books.

432
00:34:08,748 --> 00:34:10,892
Refrigerators,

433
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:15,803
washing machines, stereos...

434
00:34:23,538 --> 00:34:25,113
Long time no see, sir.

435
00:34:30,078 --> 00:34:31,182
You punk.

436
00:34:32,377 --> 00:34:34,082
Just for tonight.

437
00:34:36,918 --> 00:34:39,093
I got a studio nearby.

438
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:41,423
- What?
- I have three months off,

439
00:34:41,888 --> 00:34:44,717
so I can come visit you every day.

440
00:34:44,717 --> 00:34:45,863
For real?

441
00:34:47,058 --> 00:34:48,733
You're the best!

442
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:51,602
My gosh.

443
00:34:55,668 --> 00:34:56,943
Sorry for getting mad.

444
00:34:59,237 --> 00:35:02,812
What? When did you get mad?

445
00:35:03,638 --> 00:35:05,312
In my dream.

446
00:35:09,647 --> 00:35:10,752
My gosh.

447
00:35:12,888 --> 00:35:15,817
Ma'am. My honey is here,

448
00:35:15,817 --> 00:35:17,332
so you can go see your son.

449
00:35:18,087 --> 00:35:20,162
- What?
- Son?

450
00:35:21,388 --> 00:35:22,972
You have a son.

451
00:35:23,257 --> 00:35:27,343
Yes. She said her son has
an illness of the heart.

452
00:35:27,527 --> 00:35:29,002
That's why she works here.

453
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,642
- That's not it...
- Really?

454
00:35:31,467 --> 00:35:33,582
Is your son at this hospital?

455
00:35:33,768 --> 00:35:34,843
No.

456
00:35:35,938 --> 00:35:38,312
Your mother must be confused.

457
00:35:39,078 --> 00:35:40,323
I don't have a son.

458
00:35:40,447 --> 00:35:43,478
Don't you remember? You told me last time...

459
00:35:43,478 --> 00:35:45,653
that you're working here
because of your son.

460
00:35:47,487 --> 00:35:48,593
Goodness.

461
00:35:53,058 --> 00:35:54,702
I'll get going now.

462
00:35:55,828 --> 00:35:58,173
Okay. Have a nice day.

463
00:36:03,197 --> 00:36:04,312
Wait.

464
00:36:05,297 --> 00:36:06,383
Wait.

465
00:36:09,737 --> 00:36:10,812
That's right.

466
00:36:15,607 --> 00:36:18,022
- I'll be right back, okay?
- Okay.

467
00:36:18,748 --> 00:36:20,722
Come back quickly.

468
00:36:30,627 --> 00:36:33,202
Who are you to dump my daughter?

469
00:36:33,427 --> 00:36:34,542
I'm sorry.

470
00:36:36,168 --> 00:36:39,312
She can't eat or sleep lately.

471
00:36:40,007 --> 00:36:42,783
It's killing me inside.

472
00:36:45,877 --> 00:36:46,952
Ma'am.

473
00:36:48,647 --> 00:36:52,923
Ma Ri works very hard and
is a skilled detective.

474
00:36:54,388 --> 00:36:57,533
Please acknowledge her skills
and let her know often.

475
00:36:57,558 --> 00:36:58,633
What?

476
00:36:59,728 --> 00:37:01,033
What's this?

477
00:37:01,357 --> 00:37:03,397
Are you saying it's my fault
that she's having a tough time?

478
00:37:03,397 --> 00:37:04,998
Are you turning the blame on me?

479
00:37:04,998 --> 00:37:06,728
No, that's not it.

480
00:37:06,728 --> 00:37:08,343
You big fat jerk.

481
00:37:08,527 --> 00:37:10,743
You little...

482
00:37:10,967 --> 00:37:13,883
I can't hit you again since
you're suspended already.

483
00:37:14,038 --> 00:37:15,213
Sorry, ma'am.

484
00:37:17,507 --> 00:37:18,852
How's your mother?

485
00:37:20,547 --> 00:37:21,653
She's okay.

486
00:37:21,708 --> 00:37:23,923
With the nursing home and caretaker,

487
00:37:24,618 --> 00:37:27,823
I'm sure you spent your
entire salary to pay for them.

488
00:37:28,947 --> 00:37:30,832
What will you do now that's gone too?

489
00:37:36,527 --> 00:37:38,872
Is Officer Yoo that special to you?

490
00:37:39,897 --> 00:37:40,972
Pardon?

491
00:37:41,297 --> 00:37:43,943
The more people you want to protect,

492
00:37:44,967 --> 00:37:49,042
the more you must protect
yourself first, got that?

493
00:37:49,478 --> 00:37:51,053
You frustrating idiot.

494
00:37:54,748 --> 00:37:55,852
Dong Man.

495
00:37:56,677 --> 00:37:58,823
No one's as good with a knife as you are.

496
00:37:59,177 --> 00:38:02,248
If you come back,
I can make sure you make a lot of money.

497
00:38:02,248 --> 00:38:05,062
If I do, the Ax Gang
will come after me again.

498
00:38:05,717 --> 00:38:07,058
I don't want to burden you.

499
00:38:07,058 --> 00:38:09,133
Your family needs money.

500
00:38:09,828 --> 00:38:13,002
Your mom still does janitorial
work at the hospital, right?

501
00:38:13,397 --> 00:38:14,843
Yes, that's right.

502
00:38:14,967 --> 00:38:17,272
Come back anytime you change your mind.

503
00:38:23,138 --> 00:38:25,812
I don't have small bills. Just a minute.

504
00:38:29,478 --> 00:38:30,553
Where is it?

505
00:38:59,808 --> 00:39:01,153
I'll just charge it.

506
00:39:02,078 --> 00:39:03,153
Okay.

507
00:39:17,127 --> 00:39:18,573
This is insane.

508
00:39:21,598 --> 00:39:23,213
Why won't they pick up?

509
00:39:27,168 --> 00:39:29,752
- This is Newbie's.
- Newbie?

510
00:39:30,638 --> 00:39:31,752
Well...

511
00:39:36,078 --> 00:39:38,522
Hello? Officer Yoo Ryung's cell phone.

512
00:39:38,748 --> 00:39:39,823
What?

513
00:39:41,388 --> 00:39:44,533
I'm positive. He just left.

514
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:48,502
- He paid by credit card.
- Okay. Thank you. Okay.

515
00:39:49,328 --> 00:39:50,403
Ma'am,

516
00:39:50,927 --> 00:39:53,303
I just got a tip from Pyeonghae-dong
regarding the Grasshoppers.

517
00:39:53,498 --> 00:39:54,998
- I need to go.
- Okay.

518
00:39:54,998 --> 00:39:57,372
No, you can't go.

519
00:39:57,498 --> 00:39:59,613
- Call Lieutenant Ha.
- Why?

520
00:40:04,538 --> 00:40:06,622
I'm suspended.

521
00:40:15,317 --> 00:40:17,533
She isn't picking up.

522
00:40:20,328 --> 00:40:21,803
I'll call Woo Hyuk.

523
00:40:22,558 --> 00:40:24,502
(Our Chief)

524
00:40:31,897 --> 00:40:33,013
Ma'am.

525
00:40:35,007 --> 00:40:36,852
The day I graduated from
the Police University,

526
00:40:38,038 --> 00:40:41,122
everyone asked the same thing
because I graduated top of my class.

527
00:40:42,748 --> 00:40:44,522
"How high do you want to go?"

528
00:40:48,087 --> 00:40:49,892
Back then, my goal was clear.

529
00:40:51,357 --> 00:40:53,403
I will catch all the bad guys...

530
00:40:54,328 --> 00:40:55,863
in Korea.

531
00:40:55,958 --> 00:40:57,733
I will catch all the bad guys...

532
00:40:58,458 --> 00:41:00,002
in Korea.

533
00:41:03,737 --> 00:41:07,113
But I ended up avoiding the bad
guys instead of catching them.

534
00:41:07,507 --> 00:41:09,343
I'm ashamed of myself.

535
00:41:10,578 --> 00:41:12,783
I want to catch the Grasshoppers...

536
00:41:13,007 --> 00:41:16,122
No, I want to catch the Subway Ghost.

537
00:41:16,578 --> 00:41:18,193
He's after Newbie too.

538
00:41:18,447 --> 00:41:20,662
If you investigate a case
while you're suspended,

539
00:41:21,018 --> 00:41:23,058
you may lose your badge.

540
00:41:23,058 --> 00:41:25,363
Even if my police career
ends right here and now,

541
00:41:26,257 --> 00:41:27,363
let me end it...

542
00:41:28,427 --> 00:41:30,502
as a police officer that
I'm not ashamed of being.

543
00:41:32,357 --> 00:41:33,542
I'm begging you.

544
00:41:46,748 --> 00:41:47,852
Listen.

545
00:41:48,478 --> 00:41:50,478
If you can't catch him after all this,

546
00:41:50,478 --> 00:41:52,993
that is what you really
should be ashamed of.

547
00:41:54,288 --> 00:41:55,693
Cuff him no matter what.

548
00:41:56,518 --> 00:41:57,832
Thank you, Madam Commissioner.

549
00:41:58,357 --> 00:41:59,463
Thank you!

550
00:42:04,558 --> 00:42:05,673
Officer Lee.

551
00:42:06,098 --> 00:42:07,803
I'm heading to Pyeonghae-dong.

552
00:42:08,527 --> 00:42:10,638
Trace the credit card number I sent you,

553
00:42:10,638 --> 00:42:13,682
and get his cell phone
number and locate it for me.

554
00:42:16,237 --> 00:42:17,677
Name Koo Dong Man, age 28.

555
00:42:17,677 --> 00:42:19,823
His number is 010-469-8331.

556
00:42:19,908 --> 00:42:23,153
Please locate a cell phone.
The number is 010-469-8331.

557
00:42:25,018 --> 00:42:27,622
The Commissioner is so awesome.

558
00:42:27,647 --> 00:42:30,688
This is right.
The Grasshoppers belong to our Chief.

559
00:42:30,688 --> 00:42:32,233
That's right.

560
00:42:37,958 --> 00:42:40,472
(Yoo Ryung)

561
00:42:42,828 --> 00:42:44,173
Hey, Ma Ri!

562
00:42:44,967 --> 00:42:48,182
What's going on?
Why are you answering Officer Yoo's...

563
00:43:00,087 --> 00:43:02,823
What? A tip about the Grasshoppers?

564
00:43:04,087 --> 00:43:06,903
Okay. Send me his cell phone number.

565
00:43:08,288 --> 00:43:09,927
We identified one of the Grasshoppers.

566
00:43:09,927 --> 00:43:11,927
Ji Seok is on his way to him now.

567
00:43:11,927 --> 00:43:12,927
How did Chief...

568
00:43:12,927 --> 00:43:14,297
Name, Koo Dong Man.

569
00:43:14,297 --> 00:43:17,142
Cell phone number, 010-469-8331.

570
00:43:17,467 --> 00:43:19,967
Track all the areas where
this phone was used,

571
00:43:19,967 --> 00:43:23,176
and see if any other phones
were used in the same areas.

572
00:43:23,177 --> 00:43:26,622
The Grasshoppers always travel
together, so they're the others.

573
00:43:29,377 --> 00:43:31,252
We found two other cell phone numbers.

574
00:43:31,348 --> 00:43:32,877
The account holder is someone in his 70s.

575
00:43:32,877 --> 00:43:34,087
It must be a burner.

576
00:43:34,087 --> 00:43:35,388
Did you locate it?

577
00:43:35,388 --> 00:43:38,263
Yes. One is in Haseo-dong,
the other in Daegil-dong.

578
00:43:38,388 --> 00:43:40,162
Those punks split up.

579
00:43:40,288 --> 00:43:41,733
We'll split up too.

580
00:43:41,987 --> 00:43:43,598
Where are Detective Kim and Detective Lee?

581
00:43:43,598 --> 00:43:45,927
They went far to follow up on a tip.
I'll call them.

582
00:43:45,927 --> 00:43:47,667
No, we need to go now.

583
00:43:47,668 --> 00:43:49,668
Woo Hyuk, you go to Pyeonghae-dong.

584
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:51,797
Ji Seok is suspended, so he can't do much.

585
00:43:51,797 --> 00:43:53,408
You'll have to catch him by yourself.

586
00:43:53,408 --> 00:43:55,668
Send the two Subway Police
officers to Haseo-dong...

587
00:43:55,668 --> 00:43:57,877
since they know what the
Grasshoppers look like.

588
00:43:57,877 --> 00:43:59,237
Then I'll go to Daegil-dong...

589
00:43:59,237 --> 00:44:00,752
I'll go to Daegil-dong.

590
00:44:00,777 --> 00:44:02,222
I'll go with you.

591
00:44:04,978 --> 00:44:09,323
Cops travel together in
order to protect each other.

592
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:12,263
How can I trust someone like
you who stabs her partner...

593
00:44:12,388 --> 00:44:14,202
in the back?

594
00:44:20,297 --> 00:44:22,272
I will catch him!

595
00:44:22,567 --> 00:44:25,443
Me!

596
00:44:28,507 --> 00:44:29,983
I wasn't speeding.

597
00:44:33,708 --> 00:44:35,452
I wasn't speeding.

598
00:44:36,277 --> 00:44:37,423
Ji Seok.

599
00:44:37,578 --> 00:44:39,752
Woo Hyuk, why are you here?

600
00:44:40,418 --> 00:44:43,593
I see. Are you here to provide back-up?

601
00:44:44,618 --> 00:44:47,403
You're my back-up. Follow me.

602
00:44:49,658 --> 00:44:51,033
Darn it.

603
00:44:51,098 --> 00:44:53,343
I was sent by the Commissioner.

604
00:44:53,697 --> 00:44:55,843
You follow me.

605
00:45:18,388 --> 00:45:19,662
Darn it.

606
00:45:19,688 --> 00:45:22,263
Okay, my baby. Good going!

607
00:45:27,067 --> 00:45:28,743
Darn it.

608
00:45:30,638 --> 00:45:32,872
Darn it. Why won't it go?

609
00:45:33,268 --> 00:45:34,343
A little more.

610
00:45:34,607 --> 00:45:35,743
A little more.

611
00:45:44,078 --> 00:45:46,122
Darn it. Hey!

612
00:45:53,987 --> 00:45:55,662
Darn it!

613
00:45:57,728 --> 00:46:01,502
So why did you speed until the tire blew?

614
00:46:02,797 --> 00:46:03,912
Well...

615
00:46:04,697 --> 00:46:06,343
since it's an emergency.

616
00:46:07,138 --> 00:46:10,653
You were nervous, right?
Because your rival was so tough.

617
00:46:11,038 --> 00:46:12,182
What?

618
00:46:13,038 --> 00:46:15,877
Hey! Why you...

619
00:46:15,877 --> 00:46:17,792
Drive slowly.

620
00:46:29,427 --> 00:46:30,602
(Daegil-dong)

621
00:46:31,627 --> 00:46:33,443
That's a residential area.

622
00:46:51,578 --> 00:46:52,722
What...

623
00:46:53,418 --> 00:46:54,522
Hey.

624
00:46:55,147 --> 00:46:56,363
Who are you?

625
00:47:03,598 --> 00:47:06,897
I'm so out of shape.
He wouldn't attack me, would he?

626
00:47:06,897 --> 00:47:10,312
No. It'll be a bigger pain if he runs.

627
00:47:13,538 --> 00:47:14,668
He's close, Dad.

628
00:47:14,668 --> 00:47:15,743
What?

629
00:47:29,348 --> 00:47:30,558
Check everyone nearby.

630
00:47:30,558 --> 00:47:32,593
He's around here. Check.

631
00:47:33,987 --> 00:47:36,288
- Okay.
- It's that way, right?

632
00:47:36,288 --> 00:47:38,332
- Yes.
- Okay, good.

633
00:47:38,828 --> 00:47:40,943
A tall guy.

634
00:47:51,708 --> 00:47:53,412
He's somewhere around here.

635
00:47:56,277 --> 00:47:57,392
Hold on.

636
00:48:07,158 --> 00:48:09,263
- 1.
- 2.

637
00:48:09,558 --> 00:48:11,033
Three!

638
00:48:26,606 --> 00:48:28,892
- 1.
- 2.

639
00:48:29,077 --> 00:48:30,321
Three!

640
00:48:49,266 --> 00:48:51,106
- Who are you?
- Let's talk.

641
00:48:51,106 --> 00:48:52,106
I don't want to cause trouble.

642
00:48:52,106 --> 00:48:53,652
You're cops.

643
00:48:54,177 --> 00:48:55,737
Hey! Loosen up.

644
00:48:55,737 --> 00:48:57,422
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

645
00:48:57,646 --> 00:48:58,922
Loosen up.

646
00:49:00,177 --> 00:49:02,976
Now, now! There's no need for that.

647
00:49:02,976 --> 00:49:05,462
We came for Koo Dong Man.

648
00:49:05,686 --> 00:49:07,631
We'll just take him quietly.

649
00:49:09,416 --> 00:49:12,431
You won't just take me quietly!

650
00:49:13,186 --> 00:49:14,402
Boss.

651
00:49:14,797 --> 00:49:18,872
They're trying to frame
me and get their stats up.

652
00:49:19,896 --> 00:49:21,942
They'd tack things on to you guys...

653
00:49:22,637 --> 00:49:24,942
and send you away for life.

654
00:49:25,967 --> 00:49:27,911
Why you...

655
00:49:28,476 --> 00:49:29,652
Take out your gun.

656
00:49:29,907 --> 00:49:32,476
Ji Seok, just stand back and watch.

657
00:49:32,476 --> 00:49:33,591
Watch?

658
00:49:33,876 --> 00:49:36,792
Hey, what you learned in school won't cut...

659
00:49:39,617 --> 00:49:41,431
I boxed since I was five.

660
00:49:42,257 --> 00:49:43,661
You started early.

661
00:49:44,726 --> 00:49:46,201
Sounds good.

662
00:50:03,177 --> 00:50:04,252
Get them!

663
00:50:25,297 --> 00:50:27,341
He's within a 100m radius.

664
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:29,712
This way.

665
00:51:18,686 --> 00:51:20,091
If you make a sound,

666
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:22,591
you die.

667
00:52:24,387 --> 00:52:26,161
Freeze! Move, and I'll shoot.

668
00:52:35,996 --> 00:52:37,442
Get him!

669
00:52:42,766 --> 00:52:44,582
Let go.

670
00:52:57,686 --> 00:52:58,761
Koo Dong Man!

671
00:52:59,547 --> 00:53:00,661
Stop...

672
00:53:05,956 --> 00:53:08,772
Where is he? Koo Dong Man.

673
00:53:23,847 --> 00:53:26,982
Darn it. I think he turned off his phone.
We lost the signal.

674
00:53:27,047 --> 00:53:28,122
What?

675
00:53:43,626 --> 00:53:45,672
Woo Hyuk, how did it go?

676
00:53:45,697 --> 00:53:47,642
- Koo Dong Man!
- We lost him.

677
00:53:48,836 --> 00:53:50,911
Officer Lee, what about you?

678
00:53:51,036 --> 00:53:53,741
He hid completely.

679
00:54:05,146 --> 00:54:07,022
I just have to last four more hours.

680
00:54:08,117 --> 00:54:09,392
Four hours.

681
00:54:20,166 --> 00:54:21,571
It's 2am.

682
00:54:40,556 --> 00:54:41,692
I'm so tired.

683
00:54:46,956 --> 00:54:48,232
Grasshoppers...

684
00:54:56,567 --> 00:54:58,111
Don't come.

685
00:54:58,806 --> 00:55:00,442
Don't come.

686
00:55:01,106 --> 00:55:02,212
Don't come.

687
00:55:05,177 --> 00:55:06,321
Hey.

688
00:55:06,976 --> 00:55:08,692
- What did you do?
- What?

689
00:55:09,717 --> 00:55:11,292
The cops came after me.

690
00:55:11,786 --> 00:55:14,292
Why did you resist so much?

691
00:55:15,717 --> 00:55:16,931
What was that?

692
00:55:17,527 --> 00:55:18,701
I mean...

693
00:55:23,097 --> 00:55:24,172
Hey, Hyung Soo!

694
00:55:24,626 --> 00:55:25,701
Captain.

695
00:55:28,436 --> 00:55:29,942
Did you go to a salon?

696
00:55:30,606 --> 00:55:32,911
- What?
- You're wearing glasses too.

697
00:55:33,936 --> 00:55:35,152
What are you talking about?

698
00:55:37,036 --> 00:55:39,522
What's this? My hair looks so tacky!

699
00:55:41,277 --> 00:55:43,122
What's with these glasses?

700
00:55:43,317 --> 00:55:45,321
You talk as if someone else did it.

701
00:55:46,146 --> 00:55:48,991
Well... A broken computer?

702
00:55:49,817 --> 00:55:52,861
I remember that he annoyed
me like nobody's business.

703
00:55:53,027 --> 00:55:56,201
But once I came to,
I was in a small warehouse.

704
00:55:56,327 --> 00:55:58,602
When I checked my watch,
I had only 30 minutes left.

705
00:55:59,067 --> 00:56:01,496
Darn it. I almost missed the boat.

706
00:56:01,496 --> 00:56:03,197
His memory came back in a rush.

707
00:56:03,197 --> 00:56:04,442
- What?
- What?

708
00:56:05,166 --> 00:56:08,681
No, nothing. So...

709
00:56:09,177 --> 00:56:10,652
I need to run to the bathroom.

710
00:56:15,677 --> 00:56:19,361
If I get on the boat with them,
I won't make it off it alive.

711
00:56:20,956 --> 00:56:22,062
Hey.

712
00:56:22,887 --> 00:56:24,402
I'll go with you.

713
00:56:26,456 --> 00:56:27,732
Darn it.

714
00:56:43,536 --> 00:56:45,881
Get out. Get out here!

715
00:56:51,387 --> 00:56:53,761
Police? I'm about to die.

716
00:56:54,317 --> 00:56:56,431
Two murderers are coming after me.

717
00:56:56,717 --> 00:56:58,056
They're the Grasshoppers.

718
00:56:58,056 --> 00:57:00,502
They might be the Subway Ghost.

719
00:57:01,626 --> 00:57:03,931
Send all the cops!

720
00:57:13,336 --> 00:57:14,482
What are you doing?

721
00:57:26,547 --> 00:57:27,631
Hello?

722
00:57:30,516 --> 00:57:31,631
What?

723
00:57:34,356 --> 00:57:35,502
Okay.

724
00:57:36,757 --> 00:57:37,872
What is it?

725
00:57:40,567 --> 00:57:41,996
There's a tip that guys...

726
00:57:41,996 --> 00:57:44,312
suspected to be the Grasshoppers are
attempting murder at Incheon Harbor.

727
00:57:44,637 --> 00:57:45,982
Get there now.

728
00:57:52,376 --> 00:57:54,122
(Restricted Authorized Personnel Only)

729
00:58:12,927 --> 00:58:14,611
Freeze! Move, and I'll shoot!

730
00:58:14,766 --> 00:58:15,911
Arrest them!

731
00:58:16,666 --> 00:58:17,911
Hey.

732
00:58:21,106 --> 00:58:22,212
Darn it.

733
00:58:23,077 --> 00:58:24,852
Get them.

734
00:58:37,327 --> 00:58:38,431
Freeze!

735
00:58:54,206 --> 00:58:56,752
All I did was lend them my boat.

736
00:58:57,206 --> 00:58:59,321
The three of them said
they were going fishing.

737
00:58:59,777 --> 00:59:01,091
Where did one of them go?

738
00:59:50,626 --> 00:59:51,741
Son.

739
00:59:55,067 --> 00:59:56,511
I am...

740
00:59:57,567 --> 00:59:58,781
exhausted too, now.

741
01:00:40,127 --> 01:00:41,872
(Catch the Ghost)

742
01:00:41,966 --> 01:00:43,372
1, 2, 3. Clear!

743
01:00:43,397 --> 01:00:45,872
Choi Mi Ra just died.

744
01:00:46,036 --> 01:00:47,036
What?

745
01:00:47,036 --> 01:00:49,067
The fact that you ordered
a suspended officer...

746
01:00:49,067 --> 01:00:51,176
to investigate a case privately...

747
01:00:51,176 --> 01:00:53,236
Ji Seok is being transferred to an island.

748
01:00:53,236 --> 01:00:56,981
I don't want you to get in trouble
because of me anymore.

749
01:00:57,747 --> 01:01:00,592
I like you. A lot.

750
01:01:00,917 --> 01:01:04,061
Please reinstate our chief
to the Subway Police.

751
01:01:04,156 --> 01:01:06,917
I'll catch the Subway Ghost within the week.

752
01:01:06,917 --> 01:01:09,302
I'll do everything I can.
