00:00:21,286 --> 00:00:23,060
(_Episode 4)

2
00:00:28,546 --> 00:00:29,691
Chief!

3
00:00:30,595 --> 00:00:31,810
It's a suicide note!

4
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:40,480
Honey...

5
00:00:43,646 --> 00:00:44,921
What a nice-looking family.

6
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:48,721
That jerk is telling me to kill a person.

7
00:00:49,615 --> 00:00:53,531
I agreed to do it.

8
00:00:54,685 --> 00:00:56,660
I had no other choice.

9
00:00:57,825 --> 00:01:00,300
You've always believed in
me although I'm a loser.

10
00:01:01,466 --> 00:01:04,210
I'm sorry for letting you down like this.

11
00:01:05,936 --> 00:01:07,141
Please take good care of our son...

12
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:10,080
Ji Hwan.

13
00:01:11,105 --> 00:01:13,880
Your husband, Choi Do Chul.

14
00:01:15,046 --> 00:01:16,281
Murder for hire?

15
00:01:17,016 --> 00:01:19,951
He locked us up so he could go kill someone?

16
00:01:20,115 --> 00:01:21,261
No way.

17
00:01:21,686 --> 00:01:23,830
It's not easy for a
regular person to kill...

18
00:01:27,326 --> 00:01:28,460
It's possible...

19
00:01:29,186 --> 00:01:30,600
if they threatened his family.

20
00:01:34,865 --> 00:01:36,471
Darn it.

21
00:01:37,296 --> 00:01:38,611
Whom does he want killed,

22
00:01:39,736 --> 00:01:41,111
and why?

23
00:01:43,406 --> 00:01:46,111
I think he's the target.
It was with the suicide note.

24
00:01:46,335 --> 00:01:47,680
Walnut Cake Shop?

25
00:01:49,475 --> 00:01:51,615
Boss, everyone's asking for
a cut on their interests...

26
00:01:51,615 --> 00:01:53,820
because of that walnut cake store.

27
00:01:54,215 --> 00:01:55,460
What do you plan on doing?

28
00:01:56,486 --> 00:01:58,130
I told you to take care of it yourself.

29
00:02:00,956 --> 00:02:03,061
- That's what they meant.
- What?

30
00:02:03,355 --> 00:02:07,001
I think the loan sharks had an issue
with the Walnut Cake Shop owner.

31
00:02:07,665 --> 00:02:09,401
They said they'd "take care of it".
Those rats.

32
00:02:11,766 --> 00:02:13,070
But this shop...

33
00:02:13,865 --> 00:02:16,241
I think it's a chain that's
only in subway stations.

34
00:02:19,676 --> 00:02:22,820
You have that subway search skill.

35
00:02:26,215 --> 00:02:28,320
Can you see anything?

36
00:02:28,486 --> 00:02:30,386
It's a chain, so the exteriors are the same.

37
00:02:30,386 --> 00:02:32,285
(Walnut Cake Shop)

38
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:34,531
Plants in front of the door.
Things like that change often.

39
00:02:34,785 --> 00:02:35,931
Right.

40
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:37,700
A wide walkway out front.

41
00:02:42,865 --> 00:02:44,070
This isn't enough...

42
00:02:44,965 --> 00:02:48,281
If you knew that too,
you'd be really frightening.

43
00:02:52,976 --> 00:02:54,305
(Day 2, 8pm)

44
00:02:54,305 --> 00:02:55,651
Major Crimes?

45
00:02:57,115 --> 00:02:59,721
He jotted down a time on the photo...

46
00:03:01,046 --> 00:03:02,290
of the target.

47
00:03:04,655 --> 00:03:06,630
Chief, I think this is
the time of the crime.

48
00:03:07,555 --> 00:03:09,901
- We have 2 hours.
- We have 2 hours. Yes.

49
00:03:10,196 --> 00:03:11,331
Yes.

50
00:03:16,865 --> 00:03:19,535
Major crimes is coming here,
so hand him over to them.

51
00:03:19,535 --> 00:03:20,610
We should...

52
00:03:21,136 --> 00:03:23,341
go our separate ways as
previously discussed.

53
00:03:23,606 --> 00:03:25,805
Major Crimes doesn't know what
Do Chul or those jerks look like.

54
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:28,320
Exactly. Go your way. I won't stop you.

55
00:03:29,245 --> 00:03:30,521
Hey.

56
00:03:33,016 --> 00:03:34,160
(Loan Application)

57
00:03:36,646 --> 00:03:37,831
If you fire me,

58
00:03:38,155 --> 00:03:40,685
I'll report you for going to
borrow money while on duty.

59
00:03:40,685 --> 00:03:42,931
To an illegal loan shark, of all places.

60
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:46,531
Why you... Do you think you scare me...

61
00:03:47,865 --> 00:03:50,170
- Give me that.
- Promise you won't fire me.

62
00:03:50,495 --> 00:03:53,741
Give... Give me that. Give...

63
00:03:54,106 --> 00:03:56,040
Fine, let's talk this out. Let's...

64
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:57,711
Give it.

65
00:04:13,285 --> 00:04:14,730
She's a freakshow.

66
00:04:18,126 --> 00:04:20,496
Even if I find Do Chul in time,

67
00:04:20,496 --> 00:04:23,196
I can't keep the perp and
victim apart on my own.

68
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:25,511
Police officers must always travel in pairs.

69
00:04:26,095 --> 00:04:27,511
You know that.

70
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:34,775
How can we find him with
just one photograph?

71
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,651
We have to do what we can to find him.

72
00:04:37,316 --> 00:04:38,451
Get over here.

73
00:04:41,746 --> 00:04:43,860
Do you know this man or not?

74
00:04:44,186 --> 00:04:45,686
I told you I don't.

75
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:48,525
I told you. All I know is this office.

76
00:04:48,525 --> 00:04:52,025
I hand out the flyers,
get paid by Gold Watch.

77
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:54,025
Hand them out again, get paid again.

78
00:04:54,025 --> 00:04:55,965
Gold Watch? What's that?

79
00:04:55,965 --> 00:04:57,866
It's their nicknames.

80
00:04:57,866 --> 00:05:00,095
The guy with a scar on
his face is Gold Watch.

81
00:05:00,095 --> 00:05:01,965
The clean-cut guy is Bass.

82
00:05:01,965 --> 00:05:03,506
All the money belongs to Bass.

83
00:05:03,506 --> 00:05:05,206
He uses that money to get
all the small vendors...

84
00:05:05,206 --> 00:05:06,834
in the subway stations.

85
00:05:06,835 --> 00:05:10,821
They call them disturbers of
the underground ecosystem.

86
00:05:11,246 --> 00:05:14,290
Gold Watch. Bass?

87
00:05:14,886 --> 00:05:17,886
Let's put those Gold Watch and
Bass guys behind bars this time.

88
00:05:17,886 --> 00:05:18,886
What is "Gold Watch"?

89
00:05:18,886 --> 00:05:22,360
Well, it's just...

90
00:05:22,485 --> 00:05:24,000
There's a new shop selling gold watches.

91
00:05:27,566 --> 00:05:31,441
I think vendors at our station
borrowed money from them too.

92
00:05:31,866 --> 00:05:35,735
We couldn't say anything
because we feared retaliation.

93
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:36,735
Goodness.

94
00:05:36,735 --> 00:05:38,881
That Walnut Cake Shop?

95
00:05:39,076 --> 00:05:42,576
Bass beat up the owner for
not paying his interest,

96
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:44,675
but that was caught on camera.

97
00:05:44,675 --> 00:05:48,784
So the store owner threatened to
have him locked up for assault.

98
00:05:48,785 --> 00:05:50,116
Security cameras.

99
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:51,616
That's what I heard through the grapevine.

100
00:05:51,616 --> 00:05:54,225
I don't know where the Walnut Cake Shop is.

101
00:05:54,225 --> 00:05:56,155
Okay, I got it. By chance...

102
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:58,670
they come back, call me right away.

103
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:03,341
Chief. I can find that Walnut Cake Shop.

104
00:06:03,636 --> 00:06:04,636
What?

105
00:06:04,636 --> 00:06:07,665
I couldn't because I was
looking for clues in the photo.

106
00:06:07,665 --> 00:06:10,675
It isn't what's in the photo,
but where the photo was taken.

107
00:06:10,675 --> 00:06:12,410
The place where it was taken.

108
00:06:13,646 --> 00:06:15,850
- The security camera?
- The security camera.

109
00:06:26,415 --> 00:06:29,261
This store is in 37 stations.

110
00:06:32,256 --> 00:06:33,370
But?

111
00:06:34,095 --> 00:06:36,995
Four have cameras facing
the Walnut Cake Shop.

112
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:39,240
Sillim, Singil, Cheonho, and Yongchon.

113
00:06:39,835 --> 00:06:43,675
Sillim, Singil, Cheonho, Yongchon.

114
00:06:43,675 --> 00:06:46,310
The cameras facing the
shops at this angle are...

115
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:49,081
You even know the locations
and angles of the cameras?

116
00:06:52,275 --> 00:06:53,350
(Walnut Cake Shop)

117
00:06:57,386 --> 00:06:58,461
Yongchon Station.

118
00:06:59,256 --> 00:07:00,425
We have one hour left.

119
00:07:00,425 --> 00:07:01,500
(Goodbye Cash)

120
00:07:04,725 --> 00:07:07,100
Hold on. It's okay.

121
00:07:09,266 --> 00:07:10,540
Detective!

122
00:07:16,866 --> 00:07:18,376
(Walnut Cake)

123
00:07:18,376 --> 00:07:19,475
This is six dollars.

124
00:07:19,475 --> 00:07:21,021
Yes.

125
00:07:26,675 --> 00:07:28,386
I don't think he's here yet.

126
00:07:28,386 --> 00:07:30,761
I'll bring the owner out.

127
00:07:31,686 --> 00:07:32,761
Wait.

128
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:35,131
Let's confirm before we move.

129
00:07:38,196 --> 00:07:40,495
- Hello.
- Hello.

130
00:07:40,496 --> 00:07:42,225
You're looking good.

131
00:07:42,225 --> 00:07:43,540
It's the loan shark.

132
00:07:43,936 --> 00:07:45,441
- What for?
- It's him.

133
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:47,266
The one who lent you money.

134
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:48,581
I didn't borrow...

135
00:07:50,066 --> 00:07:52,235
Anyway, he's the one who put a hit on him.

136
00:07:52,235 --> 00:07:53,480
Let's arrest him.

137
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:57,891
If we lose Do Chul here,
we can't prevent the murder.

138
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:00,151
Yes, sir.

139
00:08:01,285 --> 00:08:04,855
But this doesn't fit.

140
00:08:04,855 --> 00:08:05,886
What?

141
00:08:05,886 --> 00:08:07,755
If he ordered a murder,

142
00:08:07,756 --> 00:08:09,660
he wouldn't be here at the murder scene.

143
00:08:10,525 --> 00:08:13,941
It's obvious he'd be the first
suspect given their relationship.

144
00:08:14,665 --> 00:08:17,235
Wouldn't he go somewhere with
lots of surveillance cameras...

145
00:08:17,235 --> 00:08:19,610
to give himself an airtight alibi?

146
00:08:21,066 --> 00:08:25,110
He came to the murder scene
at the time of the hired hit.

147
00:08:32,575 --> 00:08:34,420
I'll explain one last time.

148
00:08:34,636 --> 00:08:36,771
Don't mind Bass anymore.

149
00:08:36,835 --> 00:08:40,751
I'll knock off the interest.
Bring me all you've got tomorrow.

150
00:08:40,835 --> 00:08:42,235
If not, you die.

151
00:08:42,235 --> 00:08:44,775
I borrowed the money from Bass.

152
00:08:44,776 --> 00:08:46,605
So why are you suddenly...

153
00:08:46,605 --> 00:08:48,891
I said to bring it, so bring it.

154
00:08:49,615 --> 00:08:51,591
I manage the money now.

155
00:08:51,816 --> 00:08:53,215
Got that?

156
00:08:53,215 --> 00:08:55,816
Chief Ko, Gold Watch is here.

157
00:08:55,816 --> 00:08:58,631
He's harassing the general store
owner to pay up tomorrow...

158
00:08:58,686 --> 00:09:02,700
Okay. Go to the office.
Officer Lee should be there.

159
00:09:04,296 --> 00:09:06,241
What's wrong?

160
00:09:06,426 --> 00:09:08,235
Don't worry about Bass.

161
00:09:08,235 --> 00:09:10,464
Gold Watch will manage
the money from now on.

162
00:09:10,465 --> 00:09:12,381
Don't worry about Bass.

163
00:09:30,316 --> 00:09:31,830
What does that mean?

164
00:09:34,056 --> 00:09:35,631
It's Do Chul.

165
00:09:47,005 --> 00:09:50,211
The target isn't the shop owner,

166
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:51,751
but Bass.

167
00:09:52,075 --> 00:09:53,221
What?

168
00:09:53,605 --> 00:09:55,021
- Darn it.
- Let's go after him.

169
00:09:55,546 --> 00:09:56,721
What?

170
00:09:58,215 --> 00:09:59,491
Here.

171
00:10:05,056 --> 00:10:08,231
Gold Watch told the general
store owner to pay him now.

172
00:10:08,526 --> 00:10:10,926
That's Bass' money. It makes no sense.

173
00:10:10,926 --> 00:10:14,011
But if he was going to kill Bass,

174
00:10:14,296 --> 00:10:15,471
it does.

175
00:10:15,536 --> 00:10:17,580
Why would Gold Watch kill Bass?

176
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:22,150
It looked like Gold Watch
was after Bass' money.

177
00:10:22,276 --> 00:10:24,580
I saw murder in his eyes
when he looked at Bass.

178
00:10:25,046 --> 00:10:28,215
Why did he give him a photo of
the shop owner? And the time?

179
00:10:28,215 --> 00:10:30,215
It's the time and place
for when he'll find Bass.

180
00:10:30,215 --> 00:10:34,030
Because Bass would show up here
at this hour to collect interest.

181
00:10:34,355 --> 00:10:36,060
So he told him to use that window.

182
00:10:42,556 --> 00:10:44,625
Hurry. You'll lose him.

183
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:45,700
Where?

184
00:10:46,196 --> 00:10:48,511
Hurry up! Catch up!

185
00:10:51,365 --> 00:10:52,440
(Relief Items)

186
00:10:55,735 --> 00:10:56,810
(Exit)

187
00:11:13,686 --> 00:11:14,930
Why are you following me?

188
00:11:16,156 --> 00:11:20,771
You must have gotten your
interest ready sooner than usual.

189
00:11:22,536 --> 00:11:23,741
What's this?

190
00:11:25,735 --> 00:11:27,111
That's a fake, right?

191
00:11:29,235 --> 00:11:31,820
I locked up the cops earlier
and took it from them.

192
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:34,091
I haven't shot it yet, so I'm not sure.

193
00:11:34,245 --> 00:11:36,615
Should I test it out now to
see whether or not it's real?

194
00:11:36,615 --> 00:11:37,991
Hey.

195
00:11:42,085 --> 00:11:43,330
Where is he?

196
00:12:07,546 --> 00:12:10,315
Chief Gong, it's a murder-for-hire case.

197
00:12:10,316 --> 00:12:12,484
Get all the videos from
near Yongchon Station...

198
00:12:12,485 --> 00:12:13,891
and find someone for me.

199
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:15,790
Yes, please.

200
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,630
Jump.

201
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,161
Don't do this. Please.

202
00:12:26,161 --> 00:12:28,100
This isn't right. Don't do this.

203
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,401
I said to jump.

204
00:12:29,401 --> 00:12:30,830
Why are you doing this?

205
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:32,606
Don't do this.

206
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:35,171
Jump first. I'll be right behind you.

207
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,776
Why are you doing this?

208
00:12:37,171 --> 00:12:39,085
We'll jump together.

209
00:12:39,271 --> 00:12:42,055
Then my son...

210
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,010
can live in a slightly nicer world.

211
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:48,655
Do you think if you and I
disappear, so will your debt?

212
00:12:48,921 --> 00:12:52,195
People may die, but loans never do.

213
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:54,266
That's why I'm in this business.

214
00:12:55,321 --> 00:12:57,990
I get it. You can't afford
to pay off your debt.

215
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:00,506
So let's stop playing
around and get down now.

216
00:13:02,161 --> 00:13:04,035
Okay, I'll be generous.

217
00:13:04,401 --> 00:13:06,346
You don't have to pay two
months' worth of interest.

218
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:08,616
Just jump!

219
00:13:10,071 --> 00:13:11,285
If I die,

220
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:13,785
do you think Gold Watch will
let your family live peacefully?

221
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:18,185
He's the one who made me do this, you fool.

222
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:20,455
He promised...

223
00:13:21,151 --> 00:13:24,266
not to bother my family
if I take you with me.

224
00:13:24,651 --> 00:13:25,691
What?

225
00:13:25,691 --> 00:13:29,636
So just jump!

226
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:35,675
Wait! Wait.

227
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:37,846
This is wrong.

228
00:13:39,031 --> 00:13:40,901
I know you're doing this
because you were threatened.

229
00:13:40,901 --> 00:13:44,016
Our officers figured it
out, so we'll help you.

230
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,945
Stop doing what you're
doing and get back down.

231
00:13:47,271 --> 00:13:48,716
Were you a police officer?

232
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,415
These jerks...

233
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,285
even went to my son's school.

234
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,096
Ji Hwan...

235
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,626
never once got...

236
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,935
a toy he wanted in eight years of his life.

237
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,805
He was afraid of hurting my feelings,

238
00:14:05,561 --> 00:14:08,276
so he'd never whine or complain.

239
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:12,305
What did Ji Hwan do so wrong?

240
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:20,685
I... I won't live as a shameful
father to my son anymore.

241
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,986
I'll end everything here.

242
00:14:23,311 --> 00:14:24,726
- No...
- So,

243
00:14:27,051 --> 00:14:29,996
- please help me.
- No, don't do it.

244
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,496
What is this nonsense?
Officer, what are you doing?

245
00:14:33,921 --> 00:14:36,061
An innocent citizen is about to die here.

246
00:14:36,061 --> 00:14:37,195
Shut your mouth!

247
00:14:40,691 --> 00:14:41,805
Mister,

248
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,106
you said you're ashamed
to face your son, right?

249
00:14:44,901 --> 00:14:47,346
The merchant who found your money...

250
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,401
stands in front of people who
don't bother to glance at him...

251
00:14:50,401 --> 00:14:51,746
to win their pity.

252
00:14:52,271 --> 00:14:54,886
He talks about his son, his
wife, and his circumstance.

253
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,585
He has no other choice if he
wants to protect his family.

254
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,925
Today,

255
00:15:04,891 --> 00:15:07,596
I was humiliated enough to want to die.

256
00:15:08,921 --> 00:15:10,435
I knew it'd be shameful,

257
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,736
but I had no other choice
if I want to protect my mom.

258
00:15:15,401 --> 00:15:17,205
There are many police
officers in this world,

259
00:15:18,931 --> 00:15:22,075
but to my mom, I'm the only family she has.

260
00:15:24,771 --> 00:15:27,146
In order to become a
proud head of the family,

261
00:15:28,141 --> 00:15:30,685
one has to do something shameful every day.

262
00:15:32,411 --> 00:15:33,726
I think that's what it means to
become the head of the family.

263
00:15:35,151 --> 00:15:39,165
But the most shameful thing the
head of the family can do...

264
00:15:40,691 --> 00:15:42,335
is to leave their family.

265
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:46,065
You should fight against them and win.

266
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:48,075
Then you can protect them.

267
00:15:49,161 --> 00:15:50,276
Mister,

268
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:54,205
you're the head of a family, aren't you?

269
00:16:03,811 --> 00:16:04,956
Stop right there!

270
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:07,656
Mister.

271
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,956
You just...

272
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:14,466
made me drop my son's birthday present.

273
00:16:16,591 --> 00:16:17,805
The gun...

274
00:16:18,891 --> 00:16:20,035
and that man too.

275
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,006
No, sir. Don't do it.

276
00:16:27,171 --> 00:16:28,276
Gosh.

277
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:32,145
I lived my life the best I could,

278
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,916
but it's ending like this.

279
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:39,825
No... Don't do it.

280
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:13,926
Mister...

281
00:17:15,081 --> 00:17:16,256
No, don't do it.

282
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,446
I thought she was...

283
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,615
a freakshow.

284
00:17:45,651 --> 00:17:49,555
A rookie police officer
trying to play the hero.

285
00:17:53,921 --> 00:17:55,166
But I was wrong.

286
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,535
Newbie had been...

287
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,236
sincere all this time.

288
00:18:14,341 --> 00:18:15,486
Mister.

289
00:18:16,611 --> 00:18:18,256
Let's go see Ji Hwan.

290
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:34,906
- Mister!
- No!

291
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,295
Mister.

292
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,406
- We made it.
- We made it.

293
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:20,045
I told you.

294
00:19:20,671 --> 00:19:23,115
I need you beside me.

295
00:19:23,381 --> 00:19:24,656
You were right, Newbie.

296
00:19:26,451 --> 00:19:27,825
I should stay with you.

297
00:19:45,401 --> 00:19:47,746
Hey, punk.
You should look where you're going!

298
00:19:49,401 --> 00:19:50,946
I'm looking, that's for sure.

299
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:54,416
Chief Inspector Ko said you'd
run this way like crazy...

300
00:19:54,441 --> 00:19:56,216
and told us to stay on
guard with our eyes open.

301
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:58,956
Gosh, you guys must be hard at work...

302
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:00,325
That hurts.

303
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,266
Step on it!

304
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:08,365
This is so much fun.

305
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,635
Don't hold me so tight, it's disgusting.

306
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:14,605
Gosh. Hey, you!

307
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:20,506
By the way, how do Chief and
Newbie ride on this together?

308
00:20:21,171 --> 00:20:24,540
I wonder who holds onto whose waist.

309
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,686
Get off me. Get off me.

310
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,941
There he is.

311
00:20:28,941 --> 00:20:30,085
Hold tight.

312
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:35,651
(Sungil Police Station)

313
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:38,565
I helped you live like a human
when you had nowhere to go,

314
00:20:38,691 --> 00:20:41,520
and this is how you repay me?
How can you betray me!

315
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,595
How can I live like a human when
you never treated me like one?

316
00:20:44,831 --> 00:20:46,835
- What did you say?
- Am I wrong?

317
00:20:47,191 --> 00:20:49,500
I treated you so well!

318
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,835
What did you ever do for me?

319
00:20:50,861 --> 00:20:53,030
What did you say, you jerk?

320
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:56,045
- I'm the one who provided for you!
- It must be uncomfortable in there.

321
00:20:56,201 --> 00:20:58,615
- Yes.
- You learned everything from me!

322
00:20:58,871 --> 00:21:01,145
If I didn't teach you,
you wouldn't know anything!

323
00:21:01,681 --> 00:21:02,916
Good for you!

324
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,785
You'll get an extenuation...

325
00:21:06,351 --> 00:21:07,726
for the attempted murder charge.

326
00:21:08,451 --> 00:21:10,295
You were unilaterally assaulted,

327
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:13,496
and evidence shows they
threatened you using your family.

328
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,936
Please cheer up.

329
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,065
Thank you for saving me.

330
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:27,145
It'll take some time,

331
00:21:27,671 --> 00:21:31,075
but I'll be able to see
Ji Hwan and my wife again.

332
00:21:31,941 --> 00:21:33,085
That makes me happy.

333
00:21:34,111 --> 00:21:35,315
Thank you.

334
00:21:41,651 --> 00:21:43,956
That guy has a scar this big on his face.

335
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,720
His dad hangs out with a
guy with a bunch of tattoos.

336
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,865
No! My dad is a good man! You're wrong!

337
00:21:50,921 --> 00:21:53,060
- Liar!
- Liar!

338
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,161
- You're wrong!
- You're a liar.

339
00:21:55,161 --> 00:21:56,575
You're wrong.

340
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,035
- You're wrong...
- Ji Hwan!

341
00:22:11,111 --> 00:22:12,285
He's so cool.

342
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:15,926
Police officer, did you find my dad?

343
00:22:19,391 --> 00:22:21,166
- We did.
- Really?

344
00:22:21,921 --> 00:22:24,335
By the way, where was he?

345
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:28,706
I shouldn't actually talk about this, but...

346
00:22:31,331 --> 00:22:33,246
- What is it?
- What?

347
00:22:34,601 --> 00:22:36,916
There were some very bad men,

348
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,055
but your dad taught them a lesson.

349
00:22:43,441 --> 00:22:44,980
- Along with me.
- Amazing.

350
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,726
- Really?
- Of course.

351
00:22:48,851 --> 00:22:50,020
Your dad wants me to pass this to you.

352
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,091
- What is it?
- What is it?

353
00:22:52,091 --> 00:22:54,835
- I'm so jealous.
- That's so cool.

354
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,535
You're so lucky!

355
00:22:59,161 --> 00:23:00,365
Hey.

356
00:23:00,891 --> 00:23:02,476
By the way, Ji Hwan.

357
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:05,845
I really need your dad's help.

358
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,216
So could I...

359
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,941
borrow him for a while?

360
00:23:12,941 --> 00:23:15,385
Yes, I'll lend him to you.

361
00:23:18,411 --> 00:23:21,355
Next time, I'll come over...

362
00:23:21,411 --> 00:23:23,196
and barge in to see you.

363
00:23:23,381 --> 00:23:25,466
- You can play the officer then.
- Okay!

364
00:23:26,851 --> 00:23:28,535
How many times have you shot a gun?

365
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,490
- I want to see it.
- Can I see it too?

366
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:32,861
- Can I see your gun?
- I want to see it too.

367
00:23:32,861 --> 00:23:34,560
Be nice to Ji Hwan, okay?

368
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,161
- Okay!
- Okay!

369
00:23:36,161 --> 00:23:37,800
Don't get into fights.

370
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,401
- Come on.
- Okay.

371
00:23:39,401 --> 00:23:41,276
- Let me see it.
- Can I touch it?

372
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,145
- Do they sell it?
- Can I buy one?

373
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:48,585
(Be careful when handling the shutter.)

374
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,666
Chief.

375
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:10,406
I burned the loan application form.

376
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,799
I'm sorry I threatened you with it.

377
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,946
It's fine. Go to sleep.

378
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:20,916
Okay.

379
00:24:23,111 --> 00:24:26,726
- Chief.
- I said it's fine.

380
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,526
Whenever I go to a crime scene,

381
00:24:30,681 --> 00:24:34,325
my heart races for sure,
but I don't get excited.

382
00:24:38,191 --> 00:24:39,565
I know that.

383
00:24:42,701 --> 00:24:44,406
By the way,

384
00:24:44,661 --> 00:24:47,006
are you not interested
in getting a promotion?

385
00:24:47,401 --> 00:24:50,901
You graduated with the top
marks from the police academy,

386
00:24:50,901 --> 00:24:52,516
so why did you come to Subway Police?

387
00:24:56,111 --> 00:24:58,085
I hereby pledge...

388
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,785
- I hereby pledge...
- I hereby pledge...

389
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:02,956
that I will abide by the
legislation and the constitution,

390
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,996
protect the nation,

391
00:25:05,151 --> 00:25:08,290
and faithfully serve as volunteers...

392
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:10,490
for our citizens.

393
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:13,936
I swear with the utmost solemnity.

394
00:25:14,161 --> 00:25:15,335
Down.

395
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:17,229
Salute.

396
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:18,800
- Salute.
- Salute.

397
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,676
(Police Academy Graduation and Appointments)

398
00:25:23,901 --> 00:25:26,115
I'll catch all the bad guys...

399
00:25:26,671 --> 00:25:28,656
in Korea.

400
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,125
Just because...

401
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,795
I heard Woo Hyuk asked you to join
the Metropolitan Detective Division.

402
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:41,196
Are you going to leave?

403
00:25:41,421 --> 00:25:42,990
No, never.

404
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:45,266
I like it here. It's perfect for me.

405
00:25:46,691 --> 00:25:48,006
Go to bed now.

406
00:25:48,401 --> 00:25:49,676
Goodnight.

407
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:16,421
Firstly, the victims answered
calls made from payphones...

408
00:26:16,421 --> 00:26:18,565
and went to the crime scenes on their own.

409
00:26:19,891 --> 00:26:22,029
This is Park Ji Yun of Eunkwang Bank.

410
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:24,330
They were either threatened
or lured into a trap.

411
00:26:24,331 --> 00:26:26,630
We investigated their assets, acquaintances,

412
00:26:26,631 --> 00:26:28,446
and their whereabouts,

413
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,615
but we couldn't find anything that
could be used to lure them in.

414
00:26:31,911 --> 00:26:34,216
The victims didn't have
anything in common either.

415
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,085
(Location of victims' last phone calls)

416
00:26:38,381 --> 00:26:40,156
The last three calls were made...

417
00:26:40,681 --> 00:26:43,581
from payphones ordinary people could access.

418
00:26:43,581 --> 00:26:44,855
But this time,

419
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:48,020
it's near a desolate brook
and it's hidden by a tree too.

420
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,861
Most people wouldn't be
able to find this place.

421
00:26:49,861 --> 00:26:50,966
The suspect...

422
00:26:51,591 --> 00:26:53,191
might be someone who lives nearby.

423
00:26:53,191 --> 00:26:55,976
This person is meticulous.
Would they use one near their home?

424
00:26:56,901 --> 00:26:59,746
It's the fourth murder already.
They might have been careless.

425
00:27:04,441 --> 00:27:05,516
(Alarm: 2am)

426
00:27:19,851 --> 00:27:21,466
(Use only in emergencies)

427
00:27:23,691 --> 00:27:25,105
I already told you.

428
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,406
We'll both get fired once they
find out we went into that tunnel.

429
00:27:34,871 --> 00:27:36,115
Chief.

430
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,246
I'll take all the punishment
I deserve in due time.

431
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:43,216
Right after I catch the criminal.

432
00:28:13,911 --> 00:28:15,416
This is when I was on night duty.

433
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,526
The stationmaster wasn't here that day,

434
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:23,825
so it was just Chief and me in the station.

435
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:26,926
Same as today.

436
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,865
Does that mean...

437
00:28:31,591 --> 00:28:34,065
someone is hiding inside the station?

438
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:57,080
The Subway Ghost moves the dead
bodies through the subway tunnels.

439
00:28:57,081 --> 00:28:59,226
He isn't the Subway Ghost,

440
00:28:59,391 --> 00:29:01,125
but a Grasshopper.

441
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,075
But that can't be...

442
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,875
Back then,

443
00:29:15,701 --> 00:29:17,345
it felt like someone was there.

444
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:24,156
Could it be the Subway Ghost?

445
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:54,805
Jin, where are you?

446
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:57,045
Where on earth are you?

447
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:00,916
Jin.

448
00:31:04,081 --> 00:31:05,256
I'll...

449
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:08,256
I'll make sure to find you.

450
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,555
Come out.

451
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:39,726
I said, come out here!

452
00:31:40,651 --> 00:31:43,526
Come out and tell me where my sister is!

453
00:31:47,951 --> 00:31:49,295
Jin...

454
00:31:50,891 --> 00:31:53,466
Where is Jin?

455
00:32:16,951 --> 00:32:19,191
("DFC's Nuclear Fist, Kim Won Tae!

457
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:23,595
I think wedding planning is a
lot harder than working out.

458
00:32:24,121 --> 00:32:27,635
But I'm so happy to become
a family with you soon.

459
00:32:27,661 --> 00:32:28,776
Me too.

00:32:42,441 --> 00:32:44,111
(I'm knocked out by your gaze!)

463
00:32:44,111 --> 00:32:46,310
- My gosh!
- Over here!

464
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:47,456

Nuclear fist!

466
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:53,365
- Won Tae!
- This is crazy.

467
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:56,421
- Please look this way.
- We love you!

468
00:32:56,421 --> 00:32:57,460

Why Kim Won Tae of all people?

471
00:33:03,901 --> 00:33:05,645
I heard he makes really good money.

472
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:06,970
I doubt he takes the subway.

473
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:09,776
He was chosen as most desired
to be their bodyguard...

474
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,446
when riding the subway.

475
00:33:11,601 --> 00:33:12,886
He's got a nuclear fist.

476
00:33:12,911 --> 00:33:15,286
He has 18 degrees combined
in several martial arts.

477
00:33:16,081 --> 00:33:17,216
Gosh.

478
00:33:17,981 --> 00:33:19,185
Hey, Newbie.

479
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:21,181
You've been weird lately.

480
00:33:21,181 --> 00:33:23,096
Why don't you listen
when people are talking?

481
00:33:23,121 --> 00:33:24,780
She doesn't obey either.

482
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:27,625
I heard everything.
He has 18 degrees combined...

483
00:33:28,521 --> 00:33:30,295
So do you.

484
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,665
Who do you think would win if they fought?

485
00:33:33,891 --> 00:33:36,176
- Well...
- That's obvious.

486
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:39,070
I know Kim Won Tae is bigger,

487
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:40,931
but Chief is nimble.

488
00:33:40,931 --> 00:33:42,141
If Chief fights Kim Won Tae,

489
00:33:42,141 --> 00:33:44,470
you'll never see Chief
again in this lifetime.

490
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:46,711
- Never ever.
- Amen.

491
00:33:46,711 --> 00:33:49,315
Still, he has 18 degrees. Right, Chief?

492
00:33:49,641 --> 00:33:52,481
Well, I learned them as a
sport, not to fight.

493
00:33:52,481 --> 00:33:53,680
That's right.

494
00:33:53,681 --> 00:33:56,955
Chief Ko isn't the type
to get into fistfights.

495
00:33:57,251 --> 00:33:58,966
He's like a classic scholar. Right?

496
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,696
A classic scholar...

497
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:03,165

- Hello, sir.
- Hey.

This is Kim Won Tae.

It's nice to meet you. I'm Jo Ki Seok.

- I'm Kim Won Tae.
- Hello.

I'm Kang Soo Ho. It's an honor.
I'm a huge fan.

Isn't she pretty? Say hi.

00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,605
- You've prepared it, right?
- Yes. This way, please.

514
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,915
Excuse us.

515
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,141
The clothes are inside.

516
00:34:53,141 --> 00:34:55,070
Go in and change,
and come out when you're ready.

517
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:56,216
Okay. Thank you.

518
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,685
What's wrong?

519
00:35:29,681 --> 00:35:32,355
Are you okay?
You should've been more careful.

520
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,751
Hye Jin was rushing to leave...

521
00:35:36,751 --> 00:35:38,795
to take care of an urgent matter and fell.

522
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:43,536
You fell?

523
00:35:45,121 --> 00:35:46,236
Yes.

524
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:49,676
Ask my manager for a ride. Okay?

525
00:35:50,461 --> 00:35:51,576
Okay.

526
00:35:52,101 --> 00:35:53,975
Go. Be careful.

527
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:55,846
Just a minute.

528
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:01,716
How do I look?

529
00:36:02,311 --> 00:36:03,455
It's so awkward.

530
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:10,795
You look great!

531
00:36:12,891 --> 00:36:14,826
You look so trustworthy.

532
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,096
- This way, please.
- Okay.

533
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,165
You look great!

534
00:36:19,461 --> 00:36:21,891
- Please look this way.
- I love you!

I love you!

536
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:25,205
Please look this way.

537
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:28,101
You look great!

538
00:36:28,101 --> 00:36:29,716
This way.

539
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,446
Chief.

540
00:36:34,041 --> 00:36:36,656
I think Kim Won Tae is abusing his fiancee.

541
00:36:36,911 --> 00:36:37,981
What?

542
00:36:37,981 --> 00:36:40,185
I heard a scream while they were changing,

543
00:36:40,311 --> 00:36:42,256
and when I went in,
Hye Jin was on the floor.

544
00:36:42,851 --> 00:36:44,355
She claims she fell, but...

545
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:46,395
Why are you doing this again?

546
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:48,826
If she says she fell, she fell.

547
00:36:48,851 --> 00:36:50,765
She was shaking. I'm sure of it.

548
00:36:51,621 --> 00:36:53,605
I think she's too afraid of him to talk.

549
00:36:54,061 --> 00:36:56,935
And she was covered in bruises.

550
00:36:57,161 --> 00:36:59,705
They were of different colors,
which means it wasn't just today.

551
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,286
- What?
- This way!

552
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:07,815
- No way.
- No way.

553
00:37:11,181 --> 00:37:12,855
I'm going to go check the security footage.

554
00:37:16,851 --> 00:37:18,656
Seriously.

555
00:37:20,621 --> 00:37:23,165
I'm sure it isn't true.
they seemed to get along very well.

556
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,440
Look this way.

557
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,911
You're so handsome.

558
00:37:40,911 --> 00:37:42,581
If you run into a bad person in the subway,

559
00:37:42,581 --> 00:37:43,641
don't forget!

560
00:37:43,641 --> 00:37:44,886
Call the police!

561
00:37:45,041 --> 00:37:47,986
Subway Police is always there for you.

562
00:37:50,981 --> 00:37:52,866
Is it true?

563
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:56,720
Look this way!

564
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,935
He used that fist? That psycho.
He's a total psychopath.

565
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,205
I'll go get the PR Chief.

566
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:12,245
(I'm knocked out by your gaze!)

567
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:15,786
Over here.

568
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,556
My gosh.

569
00:38:18,041 --> 00:38:19,880
Please line up here.

570
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:20,986
What's this?

571
00:38:23,181 --> 00:38:24,355
Did she report him?

572
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:26,995
No. She says she fell...

573
00:38:29,061 --> 00:38:31,435
She apparently had many old
bruises all over her body.

574
00:38:31,891 --> 00:38:33,931
We should stop the event and
start an investigation...

575
00:38:33,931 --> 00:38:35,065
Are you mad?

576
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:36,601
Pardon?

577
00:38:36,601 --> 00:38:38,875
Was finding a corpse in front
of reporters not good enough?

578
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:40,346
We hired Kim Won Tae...

579
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:42,940
to try to fix the police's image...

580
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,245
that you destroyed.

581
00:38:44,641 --> 00:38:47,745
But what? It turns out the PR Ambassador...

582
00:38:48,041 --> 00:38:49,886
beats his girlfriend?

583
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,986
You want to go public with that?

584
00:38:53,211 --> 00:38:54,286
My job...

585
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:56,895
is on the line here.

586
00:38:58,021 --> 00:39:00,526
- Bury it.
- Bury it?

587
00:39:01,391 --> 00:39:02,466
But...

588
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:04,621
It may get bigger if it outs out later.

589
00:39:04,621 --> 00:39:06,391
How could it possibly become bigger?

590
00:39:06,391 --> 00:39:07,831
She didn't report him.

591
00:39:07,831 --> 00:39:09,731
She said she just fell,

592
00:39:09,731 --> 00:39:11,605
so that's what we know.

593
00:39:12,871 --> 00:39:14,545
We know nothing more.

594
00:39:18,771 --> 00:39:21,116
How could we ignore it
when we have a victim?

595
00:39:23,681 --> 00:39:26,256
Let's just do it. Reporter.

596
00:39:27,981 --> 00:39:29,355
Stop doing this to me.

597
00:39:34,521 --> 00:39:35,966
Let's just do our job.

598
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,231
I need to report to the Commissioner,

599
00:39:39,231 --> 00:39:42,036
so you investigate the Grasshoppers.

600
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:44,036
You saw her get hit.

601
00:39:44,331 --> 00:39:46,070
How can you ignore it?

602
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:47,205
That's...

603
00:39:48,731 --> 00:39:51,375
I'll look for a way, but...

604
00:39:53,211 --> 00:39:54,446
when I get back.

605
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:58,415
Thank you, Chief!

606
00:40:02,521 --> 00:40:04,556
(Seoun Metropolitan Police Agency)

607
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:08,096
A way to take on...

608
00:40:08,791 --> 00:40:12,165
Kim Won Tae's case
without causing trouble...

609
00:40:12,891 --> 00:40:13,966
Ma Ri.

610
00:40:14,291 --> 00:40:16,006
Did you find the screen door key?

611
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:20,245
I've been too busy. I should look properly.

612
00:40:20,331 --> 00:40:21,645
As in, you didn't find it.

613
00:40:22,431 --> 00:40:24,875
Ji Seok, where's your partner?

614
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:26,386
Didn't you come with her?

615
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,685
Our Newbie?

616
00:40:30,581 --> 00:40:33,326
She's focusing on Subway Police
matters and wouldn't come here.

617
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:35,326
She likes it there.

618
00:40:36,021 --> 00:40:37,156
She says it's perfect.

619
00:40:38,121 --> 00:40:40,596
- She does?
- Are you interested in her?

620
00:40:41,391 --> 00:40:43,366
- Yes.
- What?

621
00:40:52,871 --> 00:40:56,216
Did you tell Ji Seok that
we're interested in Yoo Ryung?

622
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:59,645
I didn't say we're interested.
I'm interested.

623
00:41:00,311 --> 00:41:02,855
What? As a woman?

624
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,386
Perhaps?

625
00:41:05,851 --> 00:41:06,986
Hey.

626
00:41:07,351 --> 00:41:10,596
She hates you and me,
second only to the Subway Ghost.

627
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:12,920
You saw her coming at me like a madwoman...

628
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,366
just because I didn't take on her case.

629
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:18,136
Do you think she'll be nice to you...

630
00:41:18,391 --> 00:41:20,205
just because you pity her?

631
00:41:26,201 --> 00:41:28,875
We're focusing on looking
into the payphones.

632
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:32,740
Report as soon as you confirm.

633
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,815
Yes, ma'am.

634
00:41:38,041 --> 00:41:40,826
I heard you caught an illegal loan shark.

635
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:43,395
He even hired a hitman?

636
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,720
Yes.

637
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,851
How did you end up closing a case like that?

638
00:41:47,851 --> 00:41:50,920
Well... Vendors from our
station got caught up in it...

639
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:54,466
What I'm saying is,
you have no time for that.

640
00:41:54,791 --> 00:41:56,461
You should've handed that
case over to Major Crimes...

641
00:41:56,461 --> 00:41:58,875
and focused on the Grasshoppers!

642
00:42:00,001 --> 00:42:01,070
I'm sorry.

643
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:03,145
We'll finish checking
the costume makers today.

644
00:42:03,701 --> 00:42:07,245
How long will you just check them?

645
00:42:07,411 --> 00:42:08,970
You lazy bums.

646
00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:11,415
Finish quickly, and bring them all to me!

647
00:42:11,711 --> 00:42:12,955
Yes, ma'am.

648
00:42:19,391 --> 00:42:21,665
Menopause is really scary, Mom.

649
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:25,561
- What?
- He closed a big case.

650
00:42:25,561 --> 00:42:26,966
Why are you so mad at him?

651
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:28,705
Whatever.

652
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,776
Maybe it's because he dumped my daughter,

653
00:42:32,931 --> 00:42:34,346
but I get so angry.

654
00:42:34,501 --> 00:42:36,045
That was ancient history.

655
00:42:36,201 --> 00:42:38,145
It's a waste, that's why.

656
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:41,711
He was always top-notch
ever since university.

657
00:42:41,711 --> 00:42:43,181
No one compared to him...

658
00:42:43,181 --> 00:42:44,585
physically or intellectually.

659
00:42:45,041 --> 00:42:46,851
If he had gone to Metro Detective Division,

660
00:42:46,851 --> 00:42:48,855
you would've lost the
promotion to lieutenant to him.

661
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:51,855
Gosh. What a waste of talent.

662
00:42:52,521 --> 00:42:53,665
Mom.

663
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:55,696
Bye.

664
00:43:03,931 --> 00:43:06,745
She doesn't even know why they broke up.

665
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,056
Careful.

666
00:43:28,891 --> 00:43:30,161
Hi there.

667
00:43:30,161 --> 00:43:31,765
Let's go.

668
00:43:33,431 --> 00:43:34,506
Okay.

669
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:43,076
Ma Ri!

670
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:48,145
Why you...

671
00:44:23,181 --> 00:44:25,756
Let me see. Are you hurt?

672
00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:28,351
I'll dress like a girl next time.

673
00:44:28,351 --> 00:44:30,495
I'd rather dress like a
girl than send you in...

674
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:31,926
and worry like crazy.

675
00:44:34,521 --> 00:44:36,521
You'd make a pretty girl.

676
00:44:36,521 --> 00:44:37,636
Right?

677
00:44:53,871 --> 00:44:55,085
Ji Seok!

678
00:45:03,621 --> 00:45:04,756
Hey, Ma Ri.

679
00:45:09,461 --> 00:45:11,961
You must have been bored,
being in Subway Police for two years,

680
00:45:11,961 --> 00:45:13,806
seeing as you took on a Major Crimes case.

681
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,605
I know, right?

682
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:18,806
If you want to come to Metro...

683
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:21,170
If you want to come, let me know.

684
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:23,076
I can look into it for you.

685
00:45:37,251 --> 00:45:38,526
Mom!

686
00:45:43,561 --> 00:45:45,935
Mom! Are you okay?

687
00:45:46,161 --> 00:45:48,105
What are you doing here?

688
00:45:48,461 --> 00:45:50,105
Ji Seok.

689
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:54,776
Are you okay?

690
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:58,145
I want to go home,

691
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:01,386
but I don't know...

692
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:05,116
where I am.

693
00:46:05,641 --> 00:46:06,725
What?

694
00:46:11,050 --> 00:46:12,725
It's okay, Mom.

695
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:16,636
It's because the roads are complicated here.

696
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:17,995
It's okay.

697
00:46:19,291 --> 00:46:20,736
It's okay, Mom.

698
00:46:20,831 --> 00:46:23,435
It's okay. Let's go. Let's go home.

699
00:46:23,461 --> 00:46:25,276
It's okay.

700
00:46:27,271 --> 00:46:29,245
Let's go.

701
00:46:31,101 --> 00:46:32,245
Let's go.

702
00:46:36,211 --> 00:46:37,486
It's okay, Mom.

703
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:40,455
It's okay.

704
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:43,625
Hold on.

705
00:46:44,021 --> 00:46:45,096
Hold on.

706
00:46:47,351 --> 00:46:49,521
- Hey, Ma Ri.
- We're getting a special promotion.

707
00:46:49,521 --> 00:46:50,859
Let's go to Metro Detective Division.

708
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:53,065
Might as well take the fast lane!

709
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:22,526
You can't go. There's no way
you're going to the Subway Police.

710
00:47:22,990 --> 00:47:24,335
Ma Ri.

711
00:47:26,891 --> 00:47:29,406
You promised to go all the way with me.

712
00:47:29,561 --> 00:47:32,636
You promised to go as high as we can!

713
00:47:33,201 --> 00:47:34,271
Sorry.

714
00:47:34,271 --> 00:47:36,469
Why would someone as good as you go there?

715
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:38,470
They catch petty criminals there!

716
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:40,271
You can't even dream of being promoted!

717
00:47:40,271 --> 00:47:41,915
Since I'll be catching petty criminals,

718
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:45,116
I'll be able to go home every day,

719
00:47:46,141 --> 00:47:47,625
and I won't get injured.

720
00:47:55,190 --> 00:47:57,466
Were you always this big a loser?

721
00:48:07,970 --> 00:48:09,545
Don't you want to come...

722
00:48:12,201 --> 00:48:14,116
- to Metro Division?
- I am...

723
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:15,986
the same, Ma Ri.

724
00:48:17,211 --> 00:48:18,685
Nothing has changed.

725
00:48:20,711 --> 00:48:23,225
Sure. People don't change.

726
00:48:40,731 --> 00:48:41,806
(Wangsoori Station)

727
00:48:49,681 --> 00:48:51,585
I really...

728
00:48:52,811 --> 00:48:54,656
don't want to go in today.

729
00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:11,629
These four places manufactured
Podori costumes...

730
00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:13,076
in the past two months. Correct?

731
00:49:13,130 --> 00:49:15,570
Yes. If we can track down the
person who placed the order,

732
00:49:15,570 --> 00:49:18,076
we can catch the Grasshoppers.

733
00:49:21,311 --> 00:49:23,886
Newbie, are you still reading that?

734
00:49:23,911 --> 00:49:25,581
I thought the higher-ups said to bury it.

735
00:49:25,581 --> 00:49:26,650
We can't investigate it anyway.

736
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:28,751
Chief said he'd look for a way.

737
00:49:28,751 --> 00:49:29,995
He did?

738
00:49:31,150 --> 00:49:32,395
I'm back.

739
00:49:33,351 --> 00:49:34,995
- Hello.
- Chief.

740
00:49:35,050 --> 00:49:36,820
We found the manufacturers
that made the Podoris.

741
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:38,061
There are four.

742
00:49:38,061 --> 00:49:39,196
Really?

743
00:49:39,521 --> 00:49:41,260
As for Kim Won Tae...

744
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:42,335
Are these the addresses?

745
00:49:42,461 --> 00:49:44,161
Yes. We can visit them right away.

746
00:49:44,161 --> 00:49:46,260
We don't have time, so let's split up.

747
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:48,731
Officer Lee, you go here.
Soo Ho, you go here.

748
00:49:48,731 --> 00:49:50,041
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

749
00:49:50,041 --> 00:49:51,176
Let's get moving.

750
00:49:51,541 --> 00:49:53,470
Chief. I looked into Kim Won Tae, and...

751
00:49:53,470 --> 00:49:54,815
About that.

752
00:49:57,181 --> 00:49:58,415
Let's drop it.

753
00:49:59,811 --> 00:50:01,711
You said you'd look for a way.

754
00:50:01,711 --> 00:50:03,696
It's the Commissioner's orders...

755
00:50:04,650 --> 00:50:06,225
to go all-in on catching the Grasshoppers.

756
00:50:07,951 --> 00:50:10,760
Then let me just meet with
Hye Jin just once, and...

757
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:12,435
I'm not the chief of Major Crimes.

758
00:50:12,661 --> 00:50:14,265
I'm the chief of the Subway Police.

759
00:50:15,431 --> 00:50:17,736
You said you won't go anywhere else, right?

760
00:50:18,561 --> 00:50:21,676
Then focus on our work.

761
00:50:22,570 --> 00:50:24,216
You go here.

762
00:50:29,371 --> 00:50:30,585
Get going.

763
00:50:41,751 --> 00:50:43,021
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

764
00:50:43,021 --> 00:50:44,165
Police.

765
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:48,065
About the recent order for a Podori...

766
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:52,406
I'd like information on the
person who ordered a Podori...

767
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:58,169
It's so dark in there. I can't see a thing.

768
00:50:58,170 --> 00:51:01,346
Anyway, I wanted to ask about
the customer who ordered...

769
00:51:02,570 --> 00:51:04,010
For training purposes.

770
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:06,415
If there were men who came with...

771
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:18,760
- Hello.
- The Podoris were made...

772
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:22,306
to teach safety to kids in kindergarten.

773
00:51:22,561 --> 00:51:25,105
Mine was a bust too. Yes.

774
00:51:26,030 --> 00:51:28,406
Come back. Okay.

775
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:31,116
Chief.

776
00:51:32,070 --> 00:51:33,170
I found them.

777
00:51:33,170 --> 00:51:36,439
Three young men asked them
to make three Podoris.

778
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:39,116
They said they needed them by August 24.

779
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:42,850
That's the date of our
30-year anniversary event.

780
00:51:42,851 --> 00:51:45,820
I got the address of the
person who placed the order.

781
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:48,225
Their address? Let's go.

782
00:51:48,291 --> 00:51:50,466
Start the engine.

783
00:51:52,461 --> 00:51:55,160
3 men ordered 3 Podori costumes,

784
00:51:55,161 --> 00:51:58,375
and they said they must finish
them by the day before our event.

785
00:51:58,961 --> 00:52:00,276
Okay.

786
00:52:02,630 --> 00:52:04,475
- Go faster!
- Yes, sir.

787
00:52:17,751 --> 00:52:18,926
This is it.

788
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:22,565
Let's go right in.
I'll go in and say I have a package.

789
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,835
You wait outside and catch
whoever tries to run.

790
00:52:27,090 --> 00:52:28,090
What?

791
00:52:28,090 --> 00:52:31,076
You're being reckless. It isn't like you.

792
00:52:32,161 --> 00:52:34,946
What if we barge in,
and not all three of them are in?

793
00:52:36,170 --> 00:52:37,875
That's not good.

794
00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:40,585
You've gotten very cautious.

795
00:52:43,981 --> 00:52:45,486
Let's get them in one blow.

796
00:52:47,251 --> 00:52:48,526
This way.

797
00:52:49,081 --> 00:52:50,256
This way.

798
00:53:18,081 --> 00:53:19,756
- Get on.
- What?

799
00:53:20,010 --> 00:53:21,426
What are you doing?

800
00:53:21,951 --> 00:53:23,026
Hurry up.

801
00:53:23,751 --> 00:53:24,826
I...

802
00:53:25,951 --> 00:53:27,165
I'm quite heavy.

803
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:31,935
I'll go up.

804
00:53:48,170 --> 00:53:50,411
If it's too much trouble,
you can let me down.

805
00:53:50,411 --> 00:53:53,116
No. Grasshoppers might be inside.

806
00:53:54,610 --> 00:53:55,986
I can stand this much pain.

807
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:14,406
Do you see anything?

808
00:54:16,101 --> 00:54:17,515
It's hard to see,

809
00:54:19,101 --> 00:54:20,645
but there are two men.

810
00:54:22,541 --> 00:54:24,315
- Really?
- But...

811
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:27,786
there are only two of them.
Let's study them a little bit.

812
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:29,725
Okay.

813
00:55:00,510 --> 00:55:02,225
Why are they so friendly with each other?

814
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,096
Are they friendly?

815
00:55:06,621 --> 00:55:08,265
Between men?

816
00:55:08,521 --> 00:55:11,036
Will they fight each other if
things don't work out well?

817
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:14,435
Fight? Are they fighting?

818
00:55:14,630 --> 00:55:16,736
I dare you to touch each other.

819
00:55:17,931 --> 00:55:20,400
If you do, I'll catch you in the act.

820
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,576
"In the act"?

821
00:55:24,271 --> 00:55:25,375
Wait...

822
00:55:32,481 --> 00:55:33,986
- Get down.
- Pardon?

823
00:55:35,150 --> 00:55:36,286
I said, get down.

824
00:55:40,851 --> 00:55:42,065
Chief.

825
00:55:46,891 --> 00:55:49,536
Now, report to me what you saw.

826
00:55:50,530 --> 00:55:53,105
Who are the people inside?

827
00:55:56,771 --> 00:55:58,475
If you don't tell me,
I'll go and find out in person.

828
00:55:59,641 --> 00:56:01,946
Chief. I'll tell you, sir.

829
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:06,355
Well...

830
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:10,156
Kim Won Tae and Hye Jin are living together.

831
00:56:21,931 --> 00:56:23,065
I'm really sorry.

832
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:27,205
I was really trying to control myself...

833
00:56:28,030 --> 00:56:29,306
I really was...

834
00:56:29,501 --> 00:56:31,676
Newbie, I know you're a righteous fighter.

835
00:56:32,170 --> 00:56:35,041
That's why even when
you put handcuffs on me,

836
00:56:35,041 --> 00:56:37,656
ran away with my gun,
investigated behind my back,

837
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:39,616
and threatened me with a loan application,

838
00:56:41,351 --> 00:56:42,550
I let things go.

839
00:56:42,550 --> 00:56:45,026
Because I know you're righteous.

840
00:56:45,150 --> 00:56:46,225
But,

841
00:56:47,251 --> 00:56:48,625
how can you lie...

842
00:56:48,690 --> 00:56:51,335
to your boss when you're an adult? You lied!

843
00:56:54,590 --> 00:56:56,536
Trust is key between partners.

844
00:56:57,201 --> 00:56:58,435
Once that trust breaks,

845
00:57:00,001 --> 00:57:01,576
the relationship breaks too.

846
00:57:05,641 --> 00:57:06,745
The police...

847
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:12,185
always work in groups of two.

848
00:57:15,211 --> 00:57:16,725
Whenever we rode on the scooter,

849
00:57:18,251 --> 00:57:20,125
having you in the backseat...

850
00:57:22,251 --> 00:57:23,835
felt like a seat belt for me.

851
00:57:26,961 --> 00:57:28,765
I just thought we should move together,

852
00:57:29,190 --> 00:57:30,605
so I lost my mind for a moment.

853
00:57:33,001 --> 00:57:34,176
I'm really sorry.

854
00:57:38,670 --> 00:57:41,245
You're not going to put the
costume company aside, are you?

855
00:57:41,470 --> 00:57:43,145
No, I'm not that bad.

856
00:57:44,211 --> 00:57:46,156
The owner of that company
was a little confused.

857
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,986
It wasn't a Podori costume. It was Posooni.

858
00:57:52,581 --> 00:57:53,665
Posooni.

859
00:57:54,391 --> 00:57:57,565
I'm really sorry I lied.

860
00:57:57,990 --> 00:57:59,065
Are you serious?

861
00:57:59,891 --> 00:58:03,265
If you do this one more
time, you'll be fired...

862
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:07,406
I must be going insane.

863
00:59:25,972 --> 00:59:29,101
You promised to never hit me again.

864
00:59:29,101 --> 00:59:31,687
It's because you keep
on looking at other men!

865
00:59:32,112 --> 00:59:33,647
You looked at someone on the subway earlier.

866
00:59:33,981 --> 00:59:36,757
Isn't that text from a man too?

867
00:59:37,811 --> 00:59:40,757
Hye Jin, you should only have eyes for me.

868
00:59:41,021 --> 00:59:43,156
Is it that hard to only look at me?

869
00:59:43,351 --> 00:59:44,527
Gosh.

870
00:59:44,921 --> 00:59:46,067
Listen.

871
00:59:46,651 --> 00:59:48,397
To have a good life with you,

872
00:59:48,561 --> 00:59:51,536
I earn money by getting beat up every day.

873
00:59:52,032 --> 00:59:53,306
But is this...

874
00:59:55,302 --> 00:59:56,507
all...

875
00:59:57,702 --> 00:59:58,946
you can do for me,

876
00:59:59,472 --> 01:00:00,676
Hye Jin?

877
01:00:01,501 --> 01:00:02,647
Stop it.

878
01:00:03,371 --> 01:00:04,746
I'll really report you.

879
01:00:05,572 --> 01:00:06,647
Report me?

880
01:00:09,882 --> 01:00:11,027
Go!

881
01:00:11,981 --> 01:00:13,926
Do it. Go ahead!

882
01:00:14,251 --> 01:00:15,656
You crazy...

883
01:00:19,392 --> 01:00:21,621
- What is this?
- Open the door! This is the police!

884
01:00:21,621 --> 01:00:24,237
Hey, did you get the police to tail me?

885
01:00:25,331 --> 01:00:27,762
No, it wasn't me.

886
01:00:27,762 --> 01:00:29,401
Don't lie to me.

887
01:00:29,401 --> 01:00:31,946
I know you're in there,
so hurry up and open the door!

888
01:00:32,401 --> 01:00:34,647
You'll get it after this.

889
01:00:40,342 --> 01:00:42,687
- Hye Jin.
- Wait, what are you doing?

890
01:00:43,182 --> 01:00:45,426
Hye Jin, are you all right?

891
01:00:46,481 --> 01:00:47,627
Let me see.

892
01:01:04,072 --> 01:01:06,076
You're under arrest in
the act of an assault.

893
01:01:08,441 --> 01:01:10,076
You have the right to an attorney...

894
01:01:10,671 --> 01:01:12,187
and you will have the
chance to defend yourself.

895
01:01:26,191 --> 01:01:28,837
Newbie brought in a time bomb with her.

896
01:01:29,492 --> 01:01:30,891
If it's going to explode anyway,

897
01:01:30,892 --> 01:01:32,567
we should make it explode
as safely as possible.

898
01:01:35,302 --> 01:01:38,101
What if the PR Chief finds out?

899
01:01:38,101 --> 01:01:39,676
We should let him go.

900
01:01:40,072 --> 01:01:43,846
We're already on their bad side
because of the Grasshoppers.

901
01:01:51,182 --> 01:01:53,257
She's trying to persuade
the woman to file a report,

902
01:01:53,851 --> 01:01:55,426
so once she does, make an official report.

903
01:01:56,822 --> 01:01:59,726
Let's hand over the
investigation and bow out.

904
01:02:00,592 --> 01:02:02,437
Sure, I guess we can do that.

905
01:02:04,432 --> 01:02:05,607
Okay.

906
01:02:11,231 --> 01:02:14,777
Name. Kim Won Tae. Age, 35.

907
01:02:15,271 --> 01:02:16,476
Detective.

908
01:02:18,142 --> 01:02:20,881
I'm the Subway Police's PR Ambassador.

909
01:02:20,882 --> 01:02:24,211
Digging into these minor
things won't help anyone.

910
01:02:24,211 --> 01:02:26,156
Profession, professional fighter.

911
01:02:29,222 --> 01:02:32,826
You're so popular lately,
you make the news just by eating.

912
01:02:33,151 --> 01:02:35,337
You'll make the front page tomorrow.

913
01:02:44,132 --> 01:02:45,806
Hye Jin!

914
01:02:47,441 --> 01:02:49,441
- Hye Jin!
- What are you doing?

915
01:02:49,441 --> 01:02:51,087
- Hye Jin!
- Stop it.

916
01:02:52,441 --> 01:02:55,317
Hye Jin. Ignore him.

917
01:02:56,211 --> 01:02:57,587
Hye Jin!

918
01:02:58,512 --> 01:03:01,096
- Let go!
- Stop it.

919
01:03:02,251 --> 01:03:06,297
Hye Jin! You know what
I did to get this far!

920
01:03:06,621 --> 01:03:09,960
No matter how much it hurt,
I dealt with it because of you,

921
01:03:09,961 --> 01:03:12,906
and I was able to beat it because of you.
You know that.

922
01:03:13,231 --> 01:03:16,762
People can't change overnight.

923
01:03:16,762 --> 01:03:19,901
I tried really hard to
refrain myself this time.

924
01:03:19,901 --> 01:03:22,076
I was trying very hard!

925
01:03:22,342 --> 01:03:23,576
Hye Jin!

926
01:03:24,171 --> 01:03:28,317
This championship fight is our future.
You know that.

927
01:03:28,882 --> 01:03:30,087
Hye Jin.

928
01:03:37,992 --> 01:03:39,326
He punched the wall...

929
01:03:40,392 --> 01:03:41,897
with his fist.

930
01:03:43,992 --> 01:03:45,967
He almost hit me,

931
01:03:46,691 --> 01:03:48,337
but he only pushed me.

932
01:03:49,862 --> 01:03:51,906
I think he was trying to refrain himself.

933
01:03:52,132 --> 01:03:53,846
That's assault.

934
01:03:54,041 --> 01:03:56,001
You don't have to be hit
for it to be assault.

935
01:03:56,001 --> 01:03:57,487
Hye Jin!

936
01:03:57,941 --> 01:03:59,786
If I go down now,

937
01:04:00,142 --> 01:04:03,757
my life and our future are both over.

938
01:04:03,952 --> 01:04:05,056
Okay?

939
01:04:06,882 --> 01:04:08,297
Hye Jin!

940
01:04:08,521 --> 01:04:09,621
Get up.

941
01:04:09,621 --> 01:04:10,722
- Hye Jin!
- Get up.

942
01:04:10,722 --> 01:04:13,821
I'm sorry. Please forgive me just this once.

943
01:04:13,822 --> 01:04:15,337
Come out!

944
01:04:16,021 --> 01:04:17,337
Hye Jin!

945
01:04:17,432 --> 01:04:18,862
I won't report him.

946
01:04:18,862 --> 01:04:22,937
Hye Jin. Domestic violence has over
a 70 percent chance of recurring.

947
01:04:23,231 --> 01:04:25,007
Please reconsider.

948
01:04:26,632 --> 01:04:28,446
I'll be better.

949
01:04:28,601 --> 01:04:30,717
I got hit because I messed up.

950
01:04:32,441 --> 01:04:36,016
He's like that because he doesn't know.

951
01:04:36,612 --> 01:04:39,056
This is how he loves,

952
01:04:39,412 --> 01:04:41,556
and I love that too.

953
01:04:43,621 --> 01:04:46,797
This is something I must deal with.

954
01:04:47,121 --> 01:04:48,866
Assault is not...

955
01:04:49,162 --> 01:04:50,937
a method of love.

956
01:04:51,532 --> 01:04:53,432
- I won't hit you again.
- Calm down, and sit.

957
01:04:53,432 --> 01:04:55,501
- Please trust me!
- You can't go in.

958
01:04:55,501 --> 01:04:56,762
- Hye Jin!
- Hye Jin.

959
01:04:56,762 --> 01:05:00,031
I'm really sorry. Hye Jin.

960
01:05:00,032 --> 01:05:01,616
- Stop.
- Hye Jin!

961
01:05:04,012 --> 01:05:05,487
Here, Chief.

962
01:05:05,642 --> 01:05:08,512
Kim Won Tae was a witness nine years ago.

963
01:05:08,512 --> 01:05:09,987
What was the case about?

964
01:05:10,012 --> 01:05:12,012
It's Hyun Mi Young's robbery and murder.

965
01:05:12,012 --> 01:05:15,226
She was Kim Won Tae's
girlfriend at the time.

966
01:05:15,822 --> 01:05:18,322
Kim Won Tae's past girlfriend was murdered?

967
01:05:18,322 --> 01:05:20,251
The cause of death was brain hemorrhage,

968
01:05:20,251 --> 01:05:21,996
but the medical examiner said...

969
01:05:22,121 --> 01:05:24,467
it was probably a result of an assault.

970
01:05:24,862 --> 01:05:26,632
She died due to an assault.

971
01:05:26,632 --> 01:05:28,862
Was Kim Won Tae the murder suspect?

972
01:05:28,862 --> 01:05:31,532
No. Her ring and wallet were missing,

973
01:05:31,532 --> 01:05:33,406
so they closed the case as a robbery-murder.

974
01:05:34,001 --> 01:05:35,817
Here's the case file.

975
01:05:37,041 --> 01:05:38,886
(Hyun Mi Young Robbery-Murder)

976
01:05:39,171 --> 01:05:40,587
(Hyun Mi Young Robbery-Murder)

977
01:05:44,211 --> 01:05:45,826
(Stolen items)

978
01:05:49,421 --> 01:05:51,021
You should've been more careful.

979
01:05:51,021 --> 01:05:55,366
Hye Jin was rushing to leave to take
care of an urgent matter and fell.

980
01:05:58,032 --> 01:06:01,507
Hye Jin has this stolen ring.

981
01:06:34,182 --> 01:06:35,657
(Catch the Ghost)

982
01:06:36,852 --> 01:06:39,556
No. He's not like that.

983
01:06:39,922 --> 01:06:41,991
I love you. Don't worry anymore.

984
01:06:41,991 --> 01:06:45,961
One person always causes trouble,
and one always fixes them.

985
01:06:45,962 --> 01:06:48,262
I'd like a new partner.

986
01:06:48,262 --> 01:06:50,566
How could you change your mind so easily?

987
01:06:51,332 --> 01:06:52,436
Newbie!

988
01:06:52,561 --> 01:06:55,507
You can't lose Newbie here.

989
01:06:56,472 --> 01:06:57,877
Chief.

990
01:06:58,542 --> 01:07:00,446
It breaks my heart.

991
01:07:00,941 --> 01:07:03,486
It breaks my heart!
