00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,480
(_All characters, organizations,
places, entities, and events...)

2
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,895
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,205
Got you.

4
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,264
Where...

5
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:20,904
is Jin?

6
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,585
Your sister...

7
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,514
is alive.

8
00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:45,394
Where is Jin?

9
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,094
Tell us!

10
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:53,534
I said, tell us.

11
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:57,805
Where is she?

12
00:01:58,329 --> 00:01:59,575
Tell us!

13
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,885
Where is she?

14
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:07,284
Don't you know the procedure?
Mirandize him first.

15
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,654
Ma Ri, Yoo Jin is alive.

16
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,124
He just said that she's alive.

17
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,555
- What?
- You punk.

18
00:02:16,749 --> 00:02:19,895
Where is she? Tell us!

19
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:23,465
If she's alive,
we can take him with us and find out.

20
00:02:25,329 --> 00:02:27,459
You are under arrest for
committing serial murders.

21
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:30,645
You have the right to an attorney
and refuse to answer questions.

22
00:02:39,339 --> 00:02:41,715
Let's go. We can go back and find out.

23
00:03:09,339 --> 00:03:10,844
She's alive.

24
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,585
Just think about that.

25
00:03:25,049 --> 00:03:28,435
Please give me three months.
We'll catch them.

26
00:03:28,619 --> 00:03:30,260
We'll round up all the criminals
including the serial killer...

27
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:33,604
as well as the pickpockets
who ridiculed the police.

28
00:03:34,059 --> 00:03:35,835
All I ask for is three months.

29
00:03:41,869 --> 00:03:44,015
There's one month remaining...

30
00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:46,585
in my life as a police officer.

31
00:03:54,749 --> 00:03:55,995
Yes?

32
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:01,194
What? You caught him?

33
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,564
Who is that?

34
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,164
You really caught him?

35
00:04:06,559 --> 00:04:08,059
- You caught him.
- Yes.

36
00:04:08,059 --> 00:04:10,004
- I can't believe it.
- Bring him over here.

37
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:11,745
You really caught him?

38
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,799
Well, you finally caught him.

39
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,045
The notorious serial
killer, the Subway Ghost.

40
00:04:17,869 --> 00:04:19,170
I can't believe what I'm seeing.

41
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:22,254
(First victim, Yoo Jin)

42
00:04:24,049 --> 00:04:25,824
What are you looking at?

43
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:29,725
Eyes down.

44
00:04:30,619 --> 00:04:33,019
Take his fingerprints first
and check his identity.

45
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,235
Okay.

46
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:44,045
We'll begin questioning him soon.
I'll report to you shortly.

47
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:01,425
You really did it. Within a week.

48
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,355
Now is the important part.

49
00:05:03,749 --> 00:05:05,495
We need to make him confess.

50
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,035
Can you get a confession from him?

51
00:05:09,689 --> 00:05:11,735
- Sorry?
- Ko Ji Seok.

52
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,305
Join Lieutenant Ha and question him.

53
00:05:16,059 --> 00:05:18,069
That's Metro's job...

54
00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:21,975
Ji Seok knows the details about
how we chased and caught him.

55
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:23,910
In order to bring him down,

56
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:26,514
the detective who knows him
best needs to pressure him.

57
00:05:27,939 --> 00:05:31,024
As of this moment,
report back to the Subway Police,

58
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,995
and until you completely bring him down,

59
00:05:34,119 --> 00:05:35,795
provide support for this investigation.

60
00:05:36,049 --> 00:05:37,865
Yes, Madam Commissioner.

61
00:05:50,869 --> 00:05:52,545
Your sister...

62
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,814
is alive.

63
00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:07,524
Name, Kim Hee Joon.
Date of birth, June 7, 1989.

64
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,095
Do you want to know?

65
00:06:18,489 --> 00:06:20,064
What happened to her?

66
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:34,185
I want to know what happened to you.

67
00:06:35,679 --> 00:06:37,410
I know you're upset about something.

68
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:39,624
And that there's something
you want to tell us.

69
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:44,464
We'll hear you out.

70
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,535
There's a lot...

71
00:06:55,629 --> 00:06:56,874
I want to tell you.

72
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,545
I guess I'll start with
that officer's sister.

73
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:12,185
I still remember it vividly.

74
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,524
Start talking.

75
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,735
I...

76
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,504
really like tunnels.

77
00:07:36,239 --> 00:07:37,485
Inside a tunnel,

78
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:40,185
any light from outside,

79
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:42,185
any sound,

80
00:07:42,939 --> 00:07:44,355
or any attention...

81
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,985
can be shut out completely.

82
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,795
It's such a secret place.

83
00:07:52,249 --> 00:07:54,095
So it's the perfect spot...

84
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,504
to do something without anyone knowing.

85
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:01,874
But that day,

86
00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:03,235
What is this?

87
00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:06,545
something unexpected happened.

88
00:08:17,749 --> 00:08:20,124
How could a person be in there?

89
00:08:21,249 --> 00:08:23,355
I was totally shocked.

90
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:26,194
What on earth are you talking about?

91
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,435
Did you think I came to confess?

92
00:08:33,489 --> 00:08:35,505
Did I seem like the real Subway Ghost?

93
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:43,714
It's just that you two were
so immersed in my story.

94
00:08:43,869 --> 00:08:46,814
I felt sorry to let you guys down.

95
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,149
I'm a witness,

96
00:08:52,149 --> 00:08:53,580
not a murderer.

97
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:56,694
You punk. Do you think this is a joke?

98
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,265
A witness?

99
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:01,689
Why does a witness have this necklace then?

100
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:03,964
And what was that about Yoo
Jin still being alive then?

101
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:08,035
My gosh, Chief Inspector Ko.
You and your temper.

102
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,734
I'll explain everything one by one.

103
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:15,614
Look at all this. There's so much!

104
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,944
On that day, we went inside
the tunnel to work as usual.

105
00:09:19,169 --> 00:09:22,285
And when I say work,
I mean collecting the stolen goods.

106
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:24,685
We were about to leave...

107
00:09:24,749 --> 00:09:26,925
when I had to pee.

108
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,895
Then I heard a sound nearby.

109
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:32,395
So I went to check...

110
00:09:32,649 --> 00:09:34,165
and saw something shocking.

111
00:09:36,989 --> 00:09:41,875
But even in that situation,
I acted like a professional.

112
00:09:42,259 --> 00:09:44,970
And then, I found out...

113
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:47,145
that she was alive.

114
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:52,569
She was still breathing.

115
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:55,285
I clearly felt her breath against my hand.

116
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,185
Captain, what's going on?

117
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:01,480
But I had no intention
of becoming some hero.

118
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,454
And I didn't want to be framed or something.

119
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:05,994
So I just ran away.

120
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,765
Anyway, I'm not a murderer.

121
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,175
I'm a witness.

122
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,604
Liar.

123
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:20,074
Ryung.

124
00:10:23,169 --> 00:10:24,539
Don't be ridiculous.

125
00:10:24,539 --> 00:10:26,810
You killed her. You killed her!

126
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:28,779
- What are you doing?
- Newbie!

127
00:10:28,779 --> 00:10:29,984
Calm down.

128
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:32,655
You lunatic.

129
00:10:33,149 --> 00:10:35,655
You stole a necklace from a
girl who was close to dying?

130
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:38,119
How could you call yourself a human being?

131
00:10:38,119 --> 00:10:40,125
When I saw you at Seolleung Station,

132
00:10:40,789 --> 00:10:44,305
I thought to myself that the
girl in that suitcase survived.

133
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,060
I actually felt relieved for you.

134
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,305
Then why...

135
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,675
did you come to my house?

136
00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:55,145
We found cigarette butts
you smoked near my house.

137
00:10:56,769 --> 00:10:58,385
That's just because...

138
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:01,679
we kept being blamed as the Subway Ghost,

139
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,824
so I did some research about
what the big fuss was about.

140
00:11:06,509 --> 00:11:08,854
And I found out you weren't
the girl in that suitcase,

141
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:10,625
but her older sister.

142
00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:12,194
So I was...

143
00:11:12,619 --> 00:11:14,494
thinking of leaving the
necklace there for you.

144
00:11:17,389 --> 00:11:18,905
Leave the necklace?

145
00:11:20,259 --> 00:11:21,600
Leave the necklace?

146
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,474
- Newbie, please.
- The necklace?

147
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:27,405
Please.

148
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:33,045
Was Jin...

149
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:37,984
really breathing?

150
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,395
She was.

151
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:45,964
It was hard for me too!

152
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:49,765
Every night when I tried to
sleep, I saw her face!

153
00:11:50,659 --> 00:11:51,805
Darn it.

154
00:11:54,259 --> 00:11:55,474
Get out right now.

155
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,545
Get out right now.

156
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:01,645
Newbie, go out for now.

157
00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:04,415
Ji Seok.

158
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:07,045
This is an interrogation.

159
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,954
Woo Hyuk, take her out of here!

160
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:18,295
I'll do everything...

161
00:12:19,149 --> 00:12:20,295
I can.

162
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:45,785
These are just your assertions.

163
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:49,125
Hyung Soo and Dong Man were there too.

164
00:12:50,119 --> 00:12:52,350
They may not have seen the dying girl,

165
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:54,224
but they saw the suitcase.

166
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,864
And this.

167
00:12:58,989 --> 00:13:00,905
I said I got this from the suitcase,

168
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:02,734
so go ask them.

169
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,704
I'm sure they remember.

170
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:16,714
Captain found that in the tunnel.

171
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:18,954
When?

172
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,194
- Did you see him?
- Yes, we did.

173
00:13:23,649 --> 00:13:25,224
When was it?

174
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,994
It was a really long time ago.

175
00:13:27,659 --> 00:13:30,635
It was...

176
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:33,604
We went into the tunnel to work...

177
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,499
It was then.

178
00:13:36,499 --> 00:13:38,300
- Let's go.
- Let's go, Captain.

179
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,029
- Hey.
- What?

180
00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:42,314
- Go on.
- He needed to pee,

181
00:13:42,539 --> 00:13:44,310
so we left first.

182
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:46,944
- That night.
- This is awesome.

183
00:13:48,139 --> 00:13:51,385
We were leaving but went back
because we heard him scream.

184
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:53,925
Captain! What's wrong?

185
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:57,425
He said there was a random
suitcase in the tunnel...

186
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:59,425
and tripped over it.

187
00:14:00,019 --> 00:14:02,094
But he was happy he found a necklace there.

188
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,405
What about that necklace, though?

189
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,074
Were you together the entire time?

190
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,344
Of course.

191
00:14:11,769 --> 00:14:13,100
When we work,

192
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,974
we look for a good spot, keep a lookout,

193
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:18,185
rob people, then find a
fence to hand over the goods.

194
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:19,614
There's a lot to do.

195
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,324
But...

196
00:14:26,149 --> 00:14:28,255
is Captain really the Subway Ghost?

197
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,464
It doesn't match.

198
00:14:33,019 --> 00:14:34,994
He is a bit of a freak,

199
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,194
but he's a scaredy-cat.

200
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,135
He's a coward.

201
00:14:53,551 --> 00:14:55,697
Even the little details are consistent.

202
00:14:56,661 --> 00:14:58,837
They say all three of them
were together the entire time.

203
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:00,506
If Kim Hee Joon...

204
00:15:01,761 --> 00:15:04,577
abducted Jin, tried to murder her,

205
00:15:04,732 --> 00:15:06,106
and moved her into the tunnel,

206
00:15:07,572 --> 00:15:09,647
he would've been alone
for at least two days.

207
00:15:11,342 --> 00:15:12,986
Is he really a witness?

208
00:15:14,271 --> 00:15:17,787
Since he traveled through the
tunnel like the Subway Ghost,

209
00:15:18,082 --> 00:15:21,527
he witnessed the Subway Ghost's crime scene.

210
00:15:23,151 --> 00:15:24,626
That makes sense too.

211
00:15:25,222 --> 00:15:26,966
But some things don't make sense...

212
00:15:28,092 --> 00:15:29,897
if he's just a witness.

213
00:15:44,742 --> 00:15:45,947
So you confirmed.

214
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:49,742
If you're a witness,

215
00:15:49,742 --> 00:15:53,011
why was your DNA found
on the victims' wallets?

216
00:15:53,011 --> 00:15:54,157
On their wallets?

217
00:15:55,582 --> 00:15:57,126
My DNA? Why?

218
00:15:57,452 --> 00:15:59,167
That's for you to explain.

219
00:15:59,952 --> 00:16:02,096
Yes, I grab people's wallets.
That's what I do, but...

220
00:16:04,292 --> 00:16:06,066
Did I steal their wallets too?

221
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:07,766
You stole them,

222
00:16:08,132 --> 00:16:09,862
called them to say you'd return them,

223
00:16:09,862 --> 00:16:11,576
and then you killed them.

224
00:16:13,102 --> 00:16:14,246
So,

225
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,887
did the Subway Ghost steal them,

226
00:16:20,072 --> 00:16:21,411
lure them out...

227
00:16:21,411 --> 00:16:23,657
saying he'd return them, then kill them?

228
00:16:25,981 --> 00:16:27,857
Then is the Subway Ghost also a pickpocket?

229
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:36,996
So that's why...

230
00:16:37,421 --> 00:16:40,506
That's why you thought
we were the Subway Ghost!

231
00:16:41,632 --> 00:16:45,006
And since you found my DNA on them...

232
00:16:46,132 --> 00:16:47,546
That totally points to me.

233
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:56,587
How are the police so bad
at reading the evidence?

234
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:58,986
Yes, I may have stolen the wallets.

235
00:16:59,312 --> 00:17:02,251
I stole about 90 percent of
the wallets on the subway.

236
00:17:02,251 --> 00:17:03,357
But...

237
00:17:03,921 --> 00:17:05,966
I sell them right away after I steal them.

238
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:08,522
You know that, Chief.
I went to Seolleung right away...

239
00:17:08,522 --> 00:17:10,097
to sell the goods I stole from Wangsoori.

240
00:17:10,661 --> 00:17:12,466
You must take the money.

241
00:17:12,862 --> 00:17:13,966
Then...

242
00:17:15,062 --> 00:17:17,262
why would they buy wallets
without any money in them?

243
00:17:17,262 --> 00:17:19,647
The IDs. They're worth good money.

244
00:17:20,971 --> 00:17:22,447
Who do you sell them to?

245
00:17:22,572 --> 00:17:24,516
We change fences all the time.

246
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:27,246
If we stick to one and
that fence gets caught,

247
00:17:27,411 --> 00:17:28,957
they'd tie us to that fence right away.

248
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:32,612
I have about 50 fences...

249
00:17:32,612 --> 00:17:34,526
that I work with.

250
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:37,951
Fine. We can verify that
by finding everyone...

251
00:17:37,951 --> 00:17:39,296
you've sold to.

252
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:43,437
The Subway Ghost lives in Pyeonghae-dong.

253
00:17:44,562 --> 00:17:46,806
How do you explain the fact
that you guys live there?

254
00:17:48,931 --> 00:17:51,572
How could I explain that?

255
00:17:51,572 --> 00:17:53,707
It's not like we're the
only people who live there.

256
00:17:54,772 --> 00:17:58,587
Plus, I don't even know
that neighborhood very well.

257
00:17:59,641 --> 00:18:00,746
That...

258
00:18:03,241 --> 00:18:04,357
Hold on.

259
00:18:05,012 --> 00:18:06,326
Come to think of it...

260
00:18:07,782 --> 00:18:09,397
We saw the suitcase together,

261
00:18:09,882 --> 00:18:11,697
so it's obviously not Hyung
Soo or Dong Man either.

262
00:18:12,122 --> 00:18:14,167
I got scared and looked like a coward...

263
00:18:15,122 --> 00:18:16,367
and destroyed our friendship.

264
00:18:20,661 --> 00:18:21,837
Why did I get scared?

265
00:18:23,262 --> 00:18:24,607
Hold on.

266
00:18:25,401 --> 00:18:27,377
I was here, and Dong Man was here.

267
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:31,847
We saw it together.

268
00:18:32,872 --> 00:18:34,246
Lieutenant Ha is being swayed.

269
00:18:40,112 --> 00:18:41,226
Yes, Detective Kim.

270
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:43,326
What?

271
00:18:50,961 --> 00:18:53,036
(Interrogation Room)

272
00:18:55,262 --> 00:18:56,302
What's up?

273
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:58,407
The fingerprints from the
coins from the payphone...

274
00:18:58,901 --> 00:19:00,607
don't match Kim Hee Joon's.

275
00:19:08,141 --> 00:19:11,216
That isn't evidence that
he isn't the Subway Ghost.

276
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:14,026
Even if he isn't the Subway Ghost,

277
00:19:15,171 --> 00:19:16,276
Kim Hee Joon...

278
00:19:17,232 --> 00:19:18,716
has the answer.

279
00:19:24,911 --> 00:19:26,857
Write down everyone who
bought your stolen goods.

280
00:19:28,082 --> 00:19:30,557
This is the only way you can get out of it.

281
00:19:32,722 --> 00:19:35,567
It would be in your best interest
to remember every single one.

282
00:19:50,371 --> 00:19:52,246
How can I remember all of them?

283
00:20:08,151 --> 00:20:10,127
She was alive.

284
00:20:10,552 --> 00:20:12,321
She was still breathing.

285
00:20:12,322 --> 00:20:15,466
I clearly felt her breath against my hand.

286
00:20:25,601 --> 00:20:26,776
Newbie.

287
00:20:32,242 --> 00:20:33,956
She was breathing.

288
00:20:38,582 --> 00:20:42,397
I'll just think she somehow
escaped and survived.

289
00:20:45,022 --> 00:20:47,137
That's what I was already thinking.

290
00:20:47,792 --> 00:20:51,032
She's your sister.
I bet she's not your average girl.

291
00:20:51,032 --> 00:20:53,077
That's exactly what I was thinking.

292
00:20:53,431 --> 00:20:57,807
She escaped, but it was difficult
to find her way back home.

293
00:20:59,201 --> 00:21:00,516
We can find her.

294
00:21:06,411 --> 00:21:09,827
You really did it. Within a week.

295
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:16,827
Officer Yoo.

296
00:21:18,962 --> 00:21:20,620
From tomorrow, don't come to work here...

297
00:21:20,621 --> 00:21:22,331
and go collect all the wanted posters...

298
00:21:22,332 --> 00:21:23,436
of the Grasshoppers.

299
00:21:24,292 --> 00:21:27,302
Are you telling me to back
off this investigation?

300
00:21:27,302 --> 00:21:28,607
Ma Ri.

301
00:21:28,772 --> 00:21:30,502
Lieutenant Ha,
this involves Ryung's sister...

302
00:21:30,502 --> 00:21:31,542
It's protocol to exclude...

303
00:21:31,542 --> 00:21:33,340
the victim's family members
from the investigation.

304
00:21:33,341 --> 00:21:35,147
Since they tend to get too emotional.

305
00:21:36,841 --> 00:21:38,617
Yet I still made an exception.

306
00:21:39,611 --> 00:21:43,087
But as you all saw,
she barged in during an interrogation.

307
00:21:43,282 --> 00:21:44,921
- That's...
- That was...

308
00:21:44,921 --> 00:21:46,597
really Newbie's mistake.

309
00:21:46,782 --> 00:21:50,696
Newbie. Apologize to her and say
this will never happen again.

310
00:21:53,762 --> 00:21:55,861
This will never happen again.

311
00:21:55,861 --> 00:21:57,137
Go collect...

312
00:21:58,502 --> 00:22:00,206
every single wanted poster.

313
00:22:01,431 --> 00:22:03,131
Since it's a waste of time
to receive tips now...

314
00:22:03,131 --> 00:22:05,972
Then I'll go collect them.
Let Newbie follow up on...

315
00:22:05,972 --> 00:22:07,176
Then...

316
00:22:08,242 --> 00:22:09,847
go collect them together.

317
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:14,657
I'm the head of this investigation,
so don't talk back and do as I say.

318
00:22:19,381 --> 00:22:20,627
Lieutenant Ha.

319
00:22:30,232 --> 00:22:32,307
(Wangsoori Station)

320
00:22:36,502 --> 00:22:37,676
I'm here.

321
00:22:38,841 --> 00:22:42,716
Gosh, you actually went out
and collected all the posters?

322
00:22:43,141 --> 00:22:47,211
Seriously, she was just being
stubborn, and yet you obliged?

323
00:22:47,212 --> 00:22:50,782
Ma Ri probably doesn't want anyone
to know she was being stubborn.

324
00:22:50,782 --> 00:22:53,897
- Oh, my.
- Since she keeps getting hurt.

325
00:22:54,181 --> 00:22:57,496
Chief, that's not what's
important right now.

326
00:22:57,651 --> 00:22:59,222
Do you know what day it is today?

327
00:22:59,222 --> 00:23:00,637
What day is it?

328
00:23:01,962 --> 00:23:03,691
Where's Newbie? When is she coming?

329
00:23:03,691 --> 00:23:06,502
She's collecting around Gangnam,
so it'll take some time. What is it?

330
00:23:06,502 --> 00:23:08,037
Today is...

331
00:23:09,931 --> 00:23:12,117
Newbie's birthday.

332
00:23:12,341 --> 00:23:13,972
Really? Today?

333
00:23:13,972 --> 00:23:14,972
Yes.

334
00:23:14,972 --> 00:23:18,617
The day I decided to consider
Newbie as my own sister,

335
00:23:20,381 --> 00:23:22,512
I marked her birthday on my calendar.

336
00:23:22,512 --> 00:23:25,621
You know that family members
never forget birthdays.

337
00:23:25,621 --> 00:23:28,851
Newbie doesn't even have a family.
She almost spent it alone.

338
00:23:28,851 --> 00:23:30,867
Ryung must be having a tough time lately.

339
00:23:32,562 --> 00:23:35,666
So how about a small... you-know-what?

340
00:23:36,391 --> 00:23:37,736
That sounds good.

341
00:23:37,962 --> 00:23:39,706
- That?
- Yes.

342
00:23:40,431 --> 00:23:42,206
Oh, that?

343
00:23:45,601 --> 00:23:47,847
(Subway Police)

344
00:23:59,851 --> 00:24:07,222
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you

345
00:24:07,222 --> 00:24:11,762
- Happy birthday dear Newbie
- Happy birthday dear Newbie

346
00:24:11,762 --> 00:24:17,746
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you

347
00:24:21,072 --> 00:24:22,246
Ta-da.

348
00:24:28,082 --> 00:24:30,127
Congratulations!

349
00:24:31,722 --> 00:24:33,996
Newbie, is this...

350
00:24:34,052 --> 00:24:37,196
strawberry cake not your taste?

351
00:24:38,691 --> 00:24:41,867
Well, we could've gotten red velvet...

352
00:24:42,062 --> 00:24:44,137
- Newbie! Soo Ho, here.
- Yes.

353
00:24:44,532 --> 00:24:45,776
Newbie!

354
00:24:47,931 --> 00:24:49,147
Ryung.

355
00:24:57,841 --> 00:24:59,787
Happy birthday, Ryung.

356
00:25:00,141 --> 00:25:01,357
Newbie.

357
00:25:07,421 --> 00:25:10,291
Newbie. What's the matter?

358
00:25:10,292 --> 00:25:13,337
Did I do something wrong?

359
00:25:18,032 --> 00:25:20,276
Both of you did nothing wrong.

360
00:25:20,661 --> 00:25:21,907
It's just that...

361
00:25:22,931 --> 00:25:26,216
I don't know if I can receive
flowers or eat cake...

362
00:25:27,242 --> 00:25:30,016
and be congratulated like this.

363
00:25:31,411 --> 00:25:33,686
Today is Jin's birthday too.

364
00:25:38,582 --> 00:25:40,052
I'm sorry, I better get going.

365
00:25:40,052 --> 00:25:41,926
Newbie. Wait!

366
00:25:44,351 --> 00:25:45,466
(Wangsoori Station)

367
00:25:59,802 --> 00:26:01,077
Isn't this place nice?

368
00:26:02,941 --> 00:26:07,016
Since it's your birthday,
I found this place for you.

369
00:26:36,841 --> 00:26:40,117
Blow out the candles with
me after the song, okay?

370
00:26:40,881 --> 00:26:41,956
Okay.

371
00:26:42,812 --> 00:26:49,526
Happy birthday to you

372
00:26:49,591 --> 00:26:53,097
Happy birthday dear Jin

373
00:26:53,522 --> 00:26:55,236
Happy birthday to you

374
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:01,176
Happy birthday.

375
00:27:02,332 --> 00:27:06,077
Let's do it again, Ryung. Again. Again!

376
00:28:33,062 --> 00:28:34,466
I'm sorry.

377
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:38,837
I know you just wanted to congratulate me,

378
00:28:39,131 --> 00:28:41,377
but I was being too selfish.

379
00:28:42,232 --> 00:28:45,776
No, I really wish you
become more selfish now.

380
00:28:46,201 --> 00:28:49,072
On days like this,
you can tell us firmly not to bother you...

381
00:28:49,072 --> 00:28:50,341
since you're feeling down.

382
00:28:50,341 --> 00:28:53,716
Or you can ask for consolation
and whine that you're sad.

383
00:28:54,141 --> 00:28:56,526
How nice would it be if you
became a bit more selfish?

384
00:29:00,522 --> 00:29:01,857
I'm sorry.

385
00:29:02,191 --> 00:29:03,567
I'm sorry too.

386
00:29:04,292 --> 00:29:07,037
I had no idea about what
scars you had in your heart...

387
00:29:07,222 --> 00:29:08,807
and I acted out of line.

388
00:29:11,391 --> 00:29:12,736
By the way,

389
00:29:13,431 --> 00:29:14,962
did you get me any gifts?

390
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:16,676
Oh, a gift. Darn.

391
00:29:16,972 --> 00:29:20,147
I prepared things in a hurry.
Is there anything you need?

392
00:29:20,441 --> 00:29:21,701
Just ask, and I'll get it for you.

393
00:29:21,701 --> 00:29:24,047
Ji Seok, that's so lame.

394
00:29:24,141 --> 00:29:25,456
What she needs?

395
00:29:25,841 --> 00:29:27,242
Are you going to get her a
toothbrush and toothpaste or what?

396
00:29:27,242 --> 00:29:28,312
What?

397
00:29:28,312 --> 00:29:31,011
Gifts are not about
giving things people need.

398
00:29:31,012 --> 00:29:33,127
It's about giving something
they don't need but want.

399
00:29:34,052 --> 00:29:36,951
A bag? Shoes? Ask me anything, Ryung.

400
00:29:36,951 --> 00:29:39,867
That punk, Woo Hyuk. There he goes again.

401
00:29:45,401 --> 00:29:46,802
I thought we called a truce.

402
00:29:46,802 --> 00:29:47,931
You really lack sense.

403
00:29:47,931 --> 00:29:50,276
I was just joking.

404
00:29:50,601 --> 00:29:51,907
Also,

405
00:29:52,701 --> 00:29:54,776
I already received my gift.

406
00:29:59,212 --> 00:30:00,340
Cheers!

407
00:30:00,341 --> 00:30:01,416
Cheers.

408
00:30:06,222 --> 00:30:10,666
On my birthday,
I wanted to smile again at least once.

409
00:30:12,062 --> 00:30:13,496
Thank you.

410
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:20,537
Are you going to keep that on?

411
00:30:21,302 --> 00:30:23,407
Yes. To celebrate your birthday.

412
00:30:23,972 --> 00:30:26,347
(Seoun Metropolitan Police Agency)

413
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:30,746
Why isn't Lieutenant Ha reporting in?

414
00:30:31,712 --> 00:30:33,486
She doesn't realize how
crazy her mom is going.

415
00:30:34,982 --> 00:30:37,456
I'm not a fan of Yoo Ryung either...

416
00:30:37,681 --> 00:30:39,857
but making her gather the wanted posters...

417
00:30:40,222 --> 00:30:43,067
Lieutenant Ha is so cold.

418
00:30:43,292 --> 00:30:45,722
You know how greedy she is.

419
00:30:45,722 --> 00:30:49,006
She can't stand that Officer
Yoo is doing better than her.

420
00:30:49,691 --> 00:30:53,006
Seeing Officer Yoo unable to
participate in the investigation,

421
00:30:53,131 --> 00:30:54,762
I do feel sorry for her, don't you?

422
00:30:54,762 --> 00:30:56,502
If you feel so sorry for her,

423
00:30:56,502 --> 00:30:58,647
collect the wanted posters for her.

424
00:30:59,201 --> 00:31:00,377
That's right.

425
00:31:04,712 --> 00:31:05,817
Come in.

426
00:31:10,212 --> 00:31:11,526
Did you want to see me?

427
00:31:12,222 --> 00:31:13,297
Sit down.

428
00:31:23,391 --> 00:31:24,466
Lieutenant Ha.

429
00:31:25,762 --> 00:31:28,476
Why did you remove Officer Yoo
from the investigation team?

430
00:31:32,002 --> 00:31:34,072
Her inability to control
her personal feelings...

431
00:31:34,072 --> 00:31:35,486
interferes with the investigation.

432
00:31:35,542 --> 00:31:38,441
So? You kicked her out
of the office completely,

433
00:31:38,441 --> 00:31:40,657
so she wouldn't know how
the investigation is going?

434
00:31:44,712 --> 00:31:48,097
If you had an ounce of
kindness, you couldn't do that.

435
00:31:49,191 --> 00:31:51,266
All she wants is to find her sister,

436
00:31:51,752 --> 00:31:54,797
even if it's finding her body.

437
00:31:56,792 --> 00:31:58,137
When I look at her,

438
00:31:58,962 --> 00:32:00,176
it hurts right here.

439
00:32:00,931 --> 00:32:03,746
I want to hug her and pat her on the back.

440
00:32:05,171 --> 00:32:08,446
Don't you feel that at all?

441
00:32:09,072 --> 00:32:11,746
Can you sleep at night
after doing that to her?

442
00:32:12,542 --> 00:32:13,787
As the lieutenant,

443
00:32:14,411 --> 00:32:17,087
I made a decision that would
help the investigation.

444
00:32:19,451 --> 00:32:20,557
Ma Ri.

445
00:32:22,891 --> 00:32:25,266
What's the point in running
hard and coming in first,

446
00:32:25,962 --> 00:32:27,421
if you don't even realize...

447
00:32:27,421 --> 00:32:30,206
the person next to you
fell and is crying in pain?

448
00:32:30,792 --> 00:32:32,676
If you stand all alone past the finish line,

449
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:34,907
what do you have left?

450
00:32:38,072 --> 00:32:41,746
You're already the best.
You're doing well enough.

451
00:32:42,841 --> 00:32:47,256
Then you should be able to look
after people who are hurting.

452
00:32:49,611 --> 00:32:50,956
I'm the best?

453
00:32:53,552 --> 00:32:55,256
I'm doing well enough?

454
00:32:58,792 --> 00:33:00,766
Why are you only saying that now?

455
00:33:03,431 --> 00:33:05,637
It hurts here when you look at Officer Yoo?

456
00:33:06,832 --> 00:33:08,871
You want to hug her and pat her on the back?

457
00:33:08,871 --> 00:33:09,977
What about me?

458
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:13,676
Didn't you feel that way
when you saw me running hard?

459
00:33:15,141 --> 00:33:17,272
You always said I was lacking
this, that wasn't enough,

460
00:33:17,272 --> 00:33:19,241
and treated me like a disappointment.

461
00:33:19,241 --> 00:33:20,957
You should've patted me on the back too.

462
00:33:24,712 --> 00:33:26,126
"You're the best."

463
00:33:28,181 --> 00:33:29,966
"You're doing well enough."

464
00:33:32,991 --> 00:33:35,267
You should've said that to me at least once.

465
00:33:44,431 --> 00:33:45,546
Ma Ri.

466
00:34:54,301 --> 00:34:55,417
Ma Ri.

467
00:35:27,942 --> 00:35:29,046
Come in.

468
00:35:41,922 --> 00:35:43,167
Ma Ri is crying.

469
00:35:45,391 --> 00:35:46,597
Is she crying a lot?

470
00:35:50,332 --> 00:35:51,537
It's all my fault.

471
00:35:57,101 --> 00:35:58,707
Everyone needs just one person...

472
00:35:59,942 --> 00:36:01,477
who will accept them...

473
00:36:02,411 --> 00:36:04,046
for who they are.

474
00:36:06,082 --> 00:36:07,787
I was that person for Ma Ri,

475
00:36:08,911 --> 00:36:10,057
but I'm...

476
00:36:11,112 --> 00:36:12,526
no longer by her side.

477
00:36:14,681 --> 00:36:15,896
Now, please be...

478
00:36:18,351 --> 00:36:19,667
that one person.

479
00:36:21,522 --> 00:36:22,667
Please...

480
00:36:23,632 --> 00:36:24,907
accept Ma Ri...

481
00:36:25,732 --> 00:36:26,977
as she is.

482
00:36:38,471 --> 00:36:40,457
(The late Choi Mi Ra)

483
00:37:11,542 --> 00:37:13,316
Mi Ra!

484
00:37:17,252 --> 00:37:19,227
Take me with you!

485
00:37:19,351 --> 00:37:21,327
- No!
- Mom.

486
00:37:22,422 --> 00:37:23,526
Mom.

487
00:37:24,851 --> 00:37:26,196
Please, Mom.

488
00:37:34,132 --> 00:37:36,046
- Don't do this.
- Let's go.

489
00:37:47,712 --> 00:37:50,827
I'll go too. You should stay and eat.

490
00:37:51,882 --> 00:37:53,026
I'll go with you.

491
00:38:07,301 --> 00:38:09,077
You look like police officers.

492
00:38:09,172 --> 00:38:10,977
Did you work with Mi Ra?

493
00:38:12,571 --> 00:38:13,676
Yes.

494
00:38:15,101 --> 00:38:19,557
I'm a detective. I was on a different team.

495
00:38:20,382 --> 00:38:21,687
I work with Dad...

496
00:38:21,982 --> 00:38:24,657
I mean, I'm a detective and
I work with Detective Lee.

497
00:38:25,681 --> 00:38:28,256
She quit almost two years ago.

498
00:38:28,551 --> 00:38:30,367
Thank you for coming.

499
00:38:31,652 --> 00:38:32,867
Of course, I should come.

500
00:38:33,922 --> 00:38:35,097
Well...

501
00:38:35,931 --> 00:38:39,577
Mi Ra worked very hard.

502
00:38:40,261 --> 00:38:43,307
When I heard she had resigned,

503
00:38:44,332 --> 00:38:46,442
I hoped she was doing well since she left...

504
00:38:46,442 --> 00:38:48,046
the difficult cop life.

505
00:38:51,071 --> 00:38:52,216
But...

506
00:38:52,842 --> 00:38:55,017
why did she quit the force?

507
00:38:55,511 --> 00:39:00,196
Well, she suddenly quit
without any specific reason.

508
00:39:00,681 --> 00:39:03,066
I scolded her a lot for it.

509
00:39:04,422 --> 00:39:05,997
But after I heard her story,

510
00:39:06,991 --> 00:39:09,606
I couldn't tell her to keep working.

511
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:14,276
Why? Did something happen?

512
00:39:15,132 --> 00:39:17,232
The people at Metro asked too.

513
00:39:17,232 --> 00:39:20,017
Well, it's stuff I've already said anyway.

514
00:39:21,571 --> 00:39:22,917
My daughter...

515
00:39:23,712 --> 00:39:26,157
had caught a perp filming women secretly.

516
00:39:27,042 --> 00:39:28,117
Hey.

517
00:39:28,842 --> 00:39:31,457
You are under arrest for
recording people without consent.

518
00:39:31,982 --> 00:39:32,982
I didn't do anything.

519
00:39:32,982 --> 00:39:36,296
I recorded you doing it on the subway.

520
00:39:36,592 --> 00:39:39,667
You shouldn't record people secretly
and lie when you're so young.

521
00:39:40,062 --> 00:39:43,367
Detective, please let me
go just this once. Please?

522
00:39:43,792 --> 00:39:46,477
I swear I'll never do it again. Please?

523
00:39:46,601 --> 00:39:48,106
Please let me go.

524
00:39:49,601 --> 00:39:50,946
Darn it... Did it get deleted?

525
00:39:54,842 --> 00:39:55,946
Hey, lady.

526
00:39:57,712 --> 00:40:00,187
- What?
- You were caught...

527
00:40:00,612 --> 00:40:02,517
trying to frame an innocent person,

528
00:40:02,982 --> 00:40:05,787
someone with his future ahead of him too.

529
00:40:06,382 --> 00:40:08,851
You admitted it yourself,
by asking me to let you go.

530
00:40:08,851 --> 00:40:10,767
When did I say that? Do you have proof?

531
00:40:12,292 --> 00:40:13,367
Hey, lady.

532
00:40:13,922 --> 00:40:16,207
My dad's a head judge at
the Seoul District Court.

533
00:40:16,491 --> 00:40:19,267
How should I handle this?

534
00:40:19,601 --> 00:40:21,577
I'm going to have to report you...

535
00:40:21,902 --> 00:40:23,146
for defamation.

536
00:40:24,971 --> 00:40:28,241
I admit I made a mistake. You can go.

537
00:40:28,241 --> 00:40:30,117
I can't just go.

538
00:40:30,212 --> 00:40:32,517
You should apologize!

539
00:40:39,482 --> 00:40:40,597
Sorry.

540
00:40:41,121 --> 00:40:43,196
Happy? Now go.

541
00:40:44,022 --> 00:40:45,267
Get on your knees.

542
00:40:46,062 --> 00:40:48,966
Get on your knees. Then I'll let you go.

543
00:40:49,332 --> 00:40:51,292
If I get you for defamation,

544
00:40:51,292 --> 00:40:53,077
quitting the force won't suffice.

545
00:40:54,232 --> 00:40:56,977
I know the law since my dad's a head judge,

546
00:40:57,402 --> 00:41:00,046
and criminal cases are
a real pain in the neck.

547
00:41:00,502 --> 00:41:03,716
It's a waste of time, money,
and you'll lose your job.

548
00:41:04,312 --> 00:41:05,586
Gosh.

549
00:41:19,051 --> 00:41:20,867
What's going on?

550
00:41:22,592 --> 00:41:26,437
She was humiliated by that young punk.

551
00:41:27,862 --> 00:41:31,707
That jerk. Please let me catch you.

552
00:41:35,801 --> 00:41:38,216
Hey. What's wrong?

553
00:41:40,241 --> 00:41:43,727
I need to go somewhere right away.

554
00:41:43,982 --> 00:41:45,327
I'm sorry.

555
00:41:45,382 --> 00:41:47,327
What? But...

556
00:41:48,551 --> 00:41:50,196
Hello.

557
00:41:54,022 --> 00:41:55,891
You never run. What's wrong?

558
00:41:55,891 --> 00:41:58,437
What's wrong? What is it?

559
00:41:58,491 --> 00:41:59,977
What is it?

560
00:42:05,071 --> 00:42:08,847
This was too humiliating,
so I didn't tell anyone...

561
00:42:08,871 --> 00:42:11,287
for the past two years,

562
00:42:12,781 --> 00:42:14,117
but I will today.

563
00:42:19,281 --> 00:42:21,026
It was about two years ago.

564
00:42:25,491 --> 00:42:26,667
Hey.

565
00:42:28,221 --> 00:42:31,836
You are under arrest for
recording people without consent.

566
00:42:32,192 --> 00:42:33,201
I did not.

567
00:42:33,201 --> 00:42:35,537
I recorded you doing it...

568
00:42:35,931 --> 00:42:38,776
on the subway right here.

569
00:42:40,042 --> 00:42:44,787
You shouldn't record people secretly
and lie when you're so young.

570
00:42:45,511 --> 00:42:48,856
Detective, please let me
go just this once. Please?

571
00:42:48,911 --> 00:42:50,351
I swear I'll never do it again. Please?

572
00:42:50,351 --> 00:42:52,026
Please let me go.

573
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:55,626
Darn it... Did it get deleted?

574
00:42:55,851 --> 00:42:57,727
Darn it.

575
00:43:00,022 --> 00:43:01,736
- Hey, mister.
- What?

576
00:43:02,192 --> 00:43:05,167
You were caught...

577
00:43:05,292 --> 00:43:07,736
trying to frame an innocent person,

578
00:43:07,761 --> 00:43:10,402
someone with his future ahead of him too.

579
00:43:10,402 --> 00:43:13,701
You just admitted it, didn't you?

580
00:43:13,701 --> 00:43:14,902
You asked me to let you go.

581
00:43:14,902 --> 00:43:16,847
When did I say that? Do you have proof?

582
00:43:17,071 --> 00:43:19,046
- Why you...
- Hey, mister.

583
00:43:19,681 --> 00:43:22,787
My dad's a head judge at
the Seoul District Court.

584
00:43:23,112 --> 00:43:25,926
How should I handle this?

585
00:43:26,181 --> 00:43:29,626
I'm going to have to
report you for defamation.

586
00:43:31,051 --> 00:43:34,236
I admit I made a mistake.

587
00:43:34,761 --> 00:43:37,336
- You can go.
- I can't just go!

588
00:43:37,761 --> 00:43:39,661
You should apologize!

589
00:43:39,661 --> 00:43:40,907
What?

590
00:43:45,801 --> 00:43:48,046
Sorry. Happy? Now go.

591
00:43:48,201 --> 00:43:49,477
Get on your knees.

592
00:43:50,871 --> 00:43:53,086
Get on your knees. Then I'll forgive you.

593
00:43:54,812 --> 00:43:56,086
Mister.

594
00:43:56,511 --> 00:43:58,457
If I get you for defamation,

595
00:43:58,482 --> 00:44:00,256
quitting the force won't suffice.

596
00:44:00,582 --> 00:44:04,626
I know the law since my dad's a head judge,

597
00:44:04,692 --> 00:44:07,466
and criminal cases are
a real pain in the neck.

598
00:44:07,592 --> 00:44:11,566
It's a waste of time, money,
and you'll lose your job.

599
00:44:13,701 --> 00:44:15,106
I thought of...

600
00:44:16,402 --> 00:44:18,876
my wife and three kids...

601
00:44:19,871 --> 00:44:21,917
and needed to survive, so...

602
00:44:28,612 --> 00:44:32,312
Hey. What are you doing? Seriously.

603
00:44:32,312 --> 00:44:34,196
I hoped no one saw,

604
00:44:35,321 --> 00:44:36,396
but...

605
00:44:38,491 --> 00:44:40,167
Mi Ra saw.

606
00:44:40,692 --> 00:44:41,966
This...

607
00:44:43,232 --> 00:44:45,867
is why she quit the Subway Police.

608
00:44:46,801 --> 00:44:48,776
I saw it in the case file.

609
00:44:49,801 --> 00:44:53,446
She used someone else's story
as her own to quit the force.

610
00:44:55,141 --> 00:44:56,387
What's this?

611
00:44:56,442 --> 00:44:58,716
It was because she couldn't say...

612
00:44:59,141 --> 00:45:01,486
the real reason for leaving the force.

613
00:45:01,942 --> 00:45:04,687
Something else happened that
she couldn't talk about.

614
00:45:04,851 --> 00:45:06,157
You're right.

615
00:45:06,851 --> 00:45:09,097
When she suddenly said she was quitting,

616
00:45:09,281 --> 00:45:11,267
her parents and colleagues...

617
00:45:11,422 --> 00:45:13,922
probably bugged her to find out why.

618
00:45:13,922 --> 00:45:16,137
She couldn't give the real reason,

619
00:45:17,692 --> 00:45:20,077
so she told them the most humiliating...

620
00:45:20,701 --> 00:45:22,977
and degrading thing she had seen.

621
00:45:23,402 --> 00:45:24,646
That's right.

622
00:45:25,672 --> 00:45:27,046
Detective Lee.

623
00:45:28,442 --> 00:45:30,011
Dad.

624
00:45:30,011 --> 00:45:32,141
Even when Metro was investigating,

625
00:45:32,141 --> 00:45:34,756
they asked why Choi Mi Ra
quit the Subway Police.

626
00:45:35,612 --> 00:45:38,681
But her colleagues and
family said the same thing,

627
00:45:38,681 --> 00:45:40,727
so we never doubted it.

628
00:45:40,781 --> 00:45:42,457
Because she and I...

629
00:45:43,051 --> 00:45:45,292
were the only ones who knew that was a lie.

630
00:45:45,292 --> 00:45:46,537
I think...

631
00:45:47,792 --> 00:45:50,106
something happened to her.

632
00:45:51,431 --> 00:45:54,407
I know the detective who
was her partner at the time.

633
00:45:54,562 --> 00:45:55,707
Hold on.

634
00:46:02,241 --> 00:46:05,172
Hi, Detective Song. It's been a while.

635
00:46:05,172 --> 00:46:09,986
I need to ask you something.
Can you stop by my office?

636
00:46:10,582 --> 00:46:11,756
Yes.

637
00:46:28,301 --> 00:46:31,772
Is this really everyone
you sold your goods to?

638
00:46:31,772 --> 00:46:33,747
- Yes.
- Yes.

639
00:46:41,312 --> 00:46:43,756
I... I missed someone.

640
00:46:43,781 --> 00:46:46,152
You're in no position to protect someone.

641
00:46:46,152 --> 00:46:48,756
He has the same pain I do,

642
00:46:49,752 --> 00:46:51,566
so I want to protect him.

643
00:46:53,422 --> 00:46:54,867
I'll put him down.

644
00:46:58,891 --> 00:47:00,577
(Kim Chul Jin)

645
00:47:05,502 --> 00:47:06,801
(Chungrim Mental Hospital
Room 206 Kim Chul Jin)

646
00:47:06,801 --> 00:47:08,646
A mental hospital?

647
00:47:09,712 --> 00:47:11,646
- Is he a patient?
- Probably.

648
00:47:12,071 --> 00:47:14,687
We shipped the goods to
him, so I never met him.

649
00:47:15,011 --> 00:47:16,187
Lieutenant.

650
00:47:18,181 --> 00:47:19,526
This guy is suspicious.

651
00:47:19,752 --> 00:47:22,526
He has stolen goods shipped
to him at a mental hospital.

652
00:47:22,551 --> 00:47:24,896
I checked with the shipping company,

653
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:28,537
and they were all immediately
before the Subway Ghost cases.

654
00:47:29,161 --> 00:47:30,232
Really?

655
00:47:30,232 --> 00:47:32,390
The account he sent the money from was fake,

656
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:34,437
and he's hiding his identity thoroughly.

657
00:47:36,062 --> 00:47:37,271
Let's go.

658
00:47:37,272 --> 00:47:39,272
If Kim Chul Jin really received the package,

659
00:47:39,272 --> 00:47:41,146
there's a good chance he's our guy.

660
00:47:48,283 --> 00:47:50,528
This is where Ji Seok's mom is.

661
00:47:55,654 --> 00:47:57,723
I'm Lieutenant Ha Ma Ri from the
Metropolitan Detective Division.

662
00:47:57,723 --> 00:47:59,254
May I see the record of packages received...

663
00:47:59,254 --> 00:48:01,269
by Kim Chul Jin in room 206?

664
00:48:01,624 --> 00:48:02,694
Why?

665
00:48:02,694 --> 00:48:04,209
Please, sir.

666
00:48:04,734 --> 00:48:05,968
Give me a minute.

667
00:48:12,734 --> 00:48:14,878
Okay. Here you go.

668
00:48:19,343 --> 00:48:22,613
Kim Chul Jin received and
signed for them himself.

669
00:48:22,613 --> 00:48:24,789
The dates are immediately before the cases.

670
00:48:27,223 --> 00:48:30,453
Does he have a shoulder tic?

671
00:48:30,453 --> 00:48:32,323
I wouldn't know.

672
00:48:32,323 --> 00:48:34,323
May we speak with his doctor?

673
00:48:34,323 --> 00:48:36,064
He's at a seminar.

674
00:48:36,064 --> 00:48:38,834
Then would you give us his
government ID and description?

675
00:48:38,834 --> 00:48:41,064
I can't do that.
That's his personal information.

676
00:48:41,064 --> 00:48:42,479
Please, sir.

677
00:48:43,104 --> 00:48:45,449
Then we'll just see him and leave.

678
00:48:48,444 --> 00:48:52,374
Another reason why Mi Ra would've quit.
I'm not sure.

679
00:48:52,374 --> 00:48:56,654
Detective Song. Did you ever see her
having a hard time or something...

680
00:48:56,654 --> 00:48:58,453
when you were with her?

681
00:48:58,453 --> 00:48:59,754
Not particularly.

682
00:48:59,754 --> 00:49:02,084
Some detectives get traumatized...

683
00:49:02,084 --> 00:49:05,053
after seeing a dead body
while investigating a case...

684
00:49:05,053 --> 00:49:07,223
and quit because they can't forget it.

685
00:49:07,223 --> 00:49:09,723
Was there a case that
may have traumatized her?

686
00:49:09,723 --> 00:49:11,909
You know how it is for the Subway Police.

687
00:49:12,334 --> 00:49:14,334
They're minor violations,
and the perps cooperate.

688
00:49:14,334 --> 00:49:16,209
We rarely even see blood.

689
00:49:16,464 --> 00:49:18,878
I know it's been long and
it's hard to remember,

690
00:49:19,834 --> 00:49:21,843
but please try remembering it one more time.

691
00:49:21,843 --> 00:49:24,418
Yes. Please do us a favor.

692
00:49:27,984 --> 00:49:30,988
There was a big incident
once at Wangsoori Station.

693
00:49:31,584 --> 00:49:33,729
But Major Crimes takes
care of cases like that.

694
00:49:34,024 --> 00:49:35,499
It didn't involve us.

695
00:49:36,053 --> 00:49:37,599
They closed it down with police-lines,

696
00:49:37,953 --> 00:49:39,699
and we weren't even allowed to go near
it, as you know.

697
00:49:40,064 --> 00:49:41,199
What was it about?

698
00:49:43,223 --> 00:49:45,168
About three years ago,

699
00:49:45,363 --> 00:49:48,278
a mentally unstable homeless man
pushed a kid onto the tracks...

700
00:49:48,504 --> 00:49:49,938
at Wangsoori Station.

701
00:49:55,874 --> 00:49:57,188
Just five minutes.

702
00:50:05,154 --> 00:50:06,699
Say it's your fault.

703
00:50:12,794 --> 00:50:15,238
Don't make noise. That's bad.

704
00:50:15,924 --> 00:50:18,608
His condition seems bad.
And he doesn't have a shoulder tic.

705
00:50:22,564 --> 00:50:24,949
Hello, my name is Ha Ma Ri.

706
00:50:25,433 --> 00:50:26,944
What is your name?

707
00:50:26,944 --> 00:50:29,749
The sky and ground, sea and river.

708
00:50:31,143 --> 00:50:34,088
When the almighty rules the world,

709
00:50:35,683 --> 00:50:37,688
bow down and welcome him.

710
00:50:38,854 --> 00:50:40,599
Ask him to save you.

711
00:50:40,783 --> 00:50:42,624
He was homeless for a long time.

712
00:50:42,624 --> 00:50:43,898
He has no family either.

713
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:45,424
If we let someone like him leave,

714
00:50:45,424 --> 00:50:47,068
he causes trouble outside, so we just don't.

715
00:50:47,763 --> 00:50:49,699
I think he hasn't left this place for years.

716
00:50:50,433 --> 00:50:52,809
- That's all I know.
- You can't make noise.

717
00:50:55,404 --> 00:50:56,539
Let's go.

718
00:50:56,904 --> 00:50:58,573
It's hard to even talk to him,
so you won't find out anything.

719
00:50:58,573 --> 00:51:01,148
By any chance, do you like coffee?

720
00:51:16,754 --> 00:51:17,968
I'll throw it out for you.

721
00:51:24,163 --> 00:51:25,369
Lift his fingerprints.

722
00:51:25,694 --> 00:51:28,163
Compare it with the partial prints
from the coins from the payphone,

723
00:51:28,163 --> 00:51:29,933
and ask if it's the same person.

724
00:51:29,933 --> 00:51:31,008
Okay.

725
00:51:31,473 --> 00:51:32,904
I'll send you the warrant
as soon as it's issued...

726
00:51:32,904 --> 00:51:34,548
so wait in front of his room.

727
00:51:34,604 --> 00:51:35,703
- Okay.
- Also,

728
00:51:35,703 --> 00:51:37,444
check if there are any medical records...

729
00:51:37,444 --> 00:51:39,243
or records of him leaving,
and send them to me.

730
00:51:39,243 --> 00:51:40,488
Okay.

731
00:51:40,513 --> 00:51:42,988
Also, please check the hospital's
security camera footage.

732
00:51:43,283 --> 00:51:45,754
Check if Kim Chul Jin really
received the packages...

733
00:51:45,754 --> 00:51:47,254
and the records for the last month.

734
00:51:47,254 --> 00:51:48,398
- All right.
- Okay.

735
00:51:57,694 --> 00:51:58,938
It smells nice.

736
00:52:03,033 --> 00:52:04,179
Ms. Han.

737
00:52:09,674 --> 00:52:10,789
Me?

738
00:52:16,143 --> 00:52:17,229
Oh...

739
00:52:18,613 --> 00:52:19,729
I'm sorry.

740
00:52:20,924 --> 00:52:22,099
It's okay.

741
00:52:28,124 --> 00:52:29,398
It smells lovely.

742
00:52:35,834 --> 00:52:37,079
Ae Shim.

743
00:52:39,334 --> 00:52:40,878
Ae Shim.

744
00:52:43,643 --> 00:52:45,643
Why did you run away?

745
00:52:45,643 --> 00:52:47,513
- You shouldn't wander off.
- Was it a girl?

746
00:52:47,513 --> 00:52:49,918
- Yes, I think so.
- How old was she?

747
00:52:51,484 --> 00:52:52,758
Maybe in elementary school?

748
00:52:59,854 --> 00:53:00,999
What if...

749
00:53:01,464 --> 00:53:03,468
the clothes found in the
closed-down platform...

750
00:53:04,234 --> 00:53:05,468
belong to her?

751
00:53:06,663 --> 00:53:08,878
Then those clothes that
were inside that crate...

752
00:53:09,734 --> 00:53:11,604
must've belonged to that dead girl.

753
00:53:11,604 --> 00:53:12,749
Come on.

754
00:53:13,004 --> 00:53:15,318
Although Major Crimes handled the case,

755
00:53:15,843 --> 00:53:17,243
as long as Choi Mi Ra was working here,

756
00:53:17,243 --> 00:53:18,988
she could've been somehow involved.

757
00:53:19,513 --> 00:53:21,289
The homeless man who pushed
that girl onto the tracks.

758
00:53:22,214 --> 00:53:23,519
We need to find him.

759
00:53:23,913 --> 00:53:25,258
(Pyeonghae-dong payphone,
Choi Mi Ra's phone call)

760
00:53:28,223 --> 00:53:30,599
The results from Kim Chul Jin's
fingerprint analysis aren't out yet?

761
00:53:31,354 --> 00:53:32,599
No, not yet.

762
00:53:36,694 --> 00:53:39,194
If the partial print from the
Pyeonghae-dong payphone...

763
00:53:39,194 --> 00:53:41,579
matches with Kim Chul Jin's fingerprint,

764
00:53:41,663 --> 00:53:45,449
there's a high probability
he is the Subway Ghost.

765
00:53:46,203 --> 00:53:49,048
But still, how on earth did he...

766
00:53:49,143 --> 00:53:51,949
He may be pretending to be mentally ill,

767
00:53:52,913 --> 00:53:54,683
but he's been locked up for two years,

768
00:53:54,683 --> 00:53:57,088
and he was homeless before he was admitted.

769
00:53:58,683 --> 00:54:01,659
There's no reason to fake being homeless.

770
00:54:03,223 --> 00:54:04,329
Right.

771
00:54:05,424 --> 00:54:08,438
He placed the body under a subway seat.

772
00:54:08,823 --> 00:54:11,608
And the clothing that was found
in a crate inside the tunnel.

773
00:54:11,734 --> 00:54:14,778
That could've been the motive for murder.

774
00:54:16,134 --> 00:54:19,449
Among cases where girls were
injured or killed in the subway,

775
00:54:19,774 --> 00:54:22,418
let's check if there's a case
related to a homeless person.

776
00:54:22,743 --> 00:54:23,814
- Let me check.
- Okay.

777
00:54:23,814 --> 00:54:26,849
Yes. It's Seoun-ro 120-2 in Incheon.

778
00:54:27,513 --> 00:54:29,519
- Yes, the number...
- Wait.

779
00:54:29,843 --> 00:54:30,988
Hold on.

780
00:54:31,683 --> 00:54:34,758
I think Metro found that homeless man.

781
00:54:38,254 --> 00:54:39,329
Wait.

782
00:54:40,493 --> 00:54:41,639
I think...

783
00:54:43,163 --> 00:54:44,508
the Subway Police found that case.

784
00:54:48,033 --> 00:54:50,573
So you're saying Kim Chul Jin,
who's in a mental hospital...

785
00:54:50,573 --> 00:54:52,203
is the homeless man...

786
00:54:52,203 --> 00:54:55,444
who pushed a girl onto the
tracks and killed her, right?

787
00:54:55,444 --> 00:54:58,413
Yes, we checked the database,

788
00:54:58,413 --> 00:55:01,559
but didn't find any search results
and couldn't confirm his identity.

789
00:55:01,584 --> 00:55:02,959
I think someone deleted it on purpose.

790
00:55:03,654 --> 00:55:04,889
So...

791
00:55:05,884 --> 00:55:08,153
the homeless man, Kim Chul
Jin, who pushed a girl...

792
00:55:08,154 --> 00:55:09,254
onto the tracks in Wangsoori Station...

793
00:55:09,254 --> 00:55:11,769
was locked up in a mental
hospital after this incident,

794
00:55:11,794 --> 00:55:13,763
and after that, he received the wallets...

795
00:55:13,763 --> 00:55:15,593
stolen by the Grasshoppers
through packages...

796
00:55:15,593 --> 00:55:17,493
and used those wallets
to contact the victims...

797
00:55:17,493 --> 00:55:19,338
pretending to help them,
but actually killed them, right?

798
00:55:19,763 --> 00:55:21,108
We're not certain yet.

799
00:55:21,404 --> 00:55:23,849
We need to see if the partial
print from the coin bin matches,

800
00:55:24,174 --> 00:55:25,933
and furthermore, that ward is a closed one,

801
00:55:25,933 --> 00:55:27,548
so he can't leave as he pleases.

802
00:55:30,814 --> 00:55:32,889
(Metro Kim Yong Do)

803
00:55:33,113 --> 00:55:34,789
- Yes, Detective Kim.
- Lieutenant Ha.

804
00:55:34,884 --> 00:55:37,484
Each time a subway serial murder occurred,

805
00:55:37,484 --> 00:55:39,758
he was transferred to another
hospital due to fascioliasis.

806
00:55:40,013 --> 00:55:41,829
I'm at the hospital
where he was transferred,

807
00:55:41,854 --> 00:55:43,624
but this ward isn't locked down.

808
00:55:43,624 --> 00:55:45,329
Anyone can leave freely.

809
00:55:46,553 --> 00:55:48,769
- All right.
- It's a match.

810
00:55:50,663 --> 00:55:52,938
- The partial fingerprint?
- Yes, they match with Kim Chul Jin.

811
00:55:54,533 --> 00:55:56,679
- Let's go to the hospital now.
- I'll get the car.

812
00:55:57,274 --> 00:55:58,409
Lieutenant Ha.

813
00:55:59,404 --> 00:56:00,479
May I go too?

814
00:56:02,104 --> 00:56:03,818
- Follow me.
- Thank you.

815
00:56:04,573 --> 00:56:06,088
Call your mom.

816
00:56:06,544 --> 00:56:07,889
The hospital Kim Chul Jin is at...

817
00:56:08,783 --> 00:56:10,059
is the same place she's staying in.

818
00:56:10,654 --> 00:56:11,729
What?

819
00:56:13,183 --> 00:56:14,559
The receiver cannot be reached.

820
00:56:15,754 --> 00:56:17,398
Why isn't she answering?

821
00:56:18,223 --> 00:56:19,553
Your mom isn't answering?

822
00:56:19,553 --> 00:56:22,168
No. There's a lady who takes care of her,

823
00:56:22,624 --> 00:56:24,309
but she's not answering her phone.

824
00:56:24,893 --> 00:56:26,269
This is so frustrating.

825
00:56:34,073 --> 00:56:35,449
Then is Jin...

826
00:56:36,303 --> 00:56:38,249
not related to this case?

827
00:56:39,643 --> 00:56:42,214
The owner of those clothes
was pushed by Kim Chul Jin...

828
00:56:42,214 --> 00:56:43,513
onto the tracks and died.

829
00:56:43,513 --> 00:56:45,354
And your sister's DNA was found...

830
00:56:45,354 --> 00:56:47,358
from that dead girl's clothing.

831
00:56:48,024 --> 00:56:50,499
Your sister is probably
responsible for that death somehow.

832
00:56:51,223 --> 00:56:52,898
If she's responsible for that death,

833
00:56:53,223 --> 00:56:56,139
she had to have been present
when that girl was pushed.

834
00:56:57,134 --> 00:56:59,438
But I was always by her side.

835
00:57:00,464 --> 00:57:01,738
She's not related to this case.

836
00:57:01,904 --> 00:57:03,909
Saying she's responsible
seems inappropriate.

837
00:57:04,604 --> 00:57:07,548
But there could be a
connection, so think carefully.

838
00:57:08,104 --> 00:57:10,548
Was there never a time
when you left her side?

839
00:57:12,573 --> 00:57:14,418
When there was something I
really couldn't get out of,

840
00:57:14,814 --> 00:57:16,988
my friend Mi Hyun looked after her.

841
00:57:17,413 --> 00:57:18,688
Nothing happened.

842
00:57:19,683 --> 00:57:21,829
Mi Hyun is my friend and
she won't hide anything.

843
00:57:24,393 --> 00:57:26,993
Sir, about Patient Kim Yeong Ho.

844
00:57:26,993 --> 00:57:29,938
You still didn't check
his insurance benefits?

845
00:57:30,763 --> 00:57:32,309
Oh, right.

846
00:57:32,763 --> 00:57:35,508
Some detectives from Metro Division
suddenly came looking for someone.

847
00:57:35,863 --> 00:57:37,849
- I forgot.
- Metro Division?

848
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:40,679
That's where Ryung works.
Are they still here?

849
00:57:41,343 --> 00:57:42,404
I don't know.

850
00:57:42,404 --> 00:57:44,619
I think a few of them left and some stayed.

851
00:57:45,544 --> 00:57:47,519
Darn, it's bugging me.

852
00:57:48,283 --> 00:57:51,258
The patients will get concerned
with cops coming in and out of here.

853
00:57:52,013 --> 00:57:53,654
I'll go check. Where are they?

854
00:57:53,654 --> 00:57:55,999
Will you? It's room 206 in the closed ward.

855
00:57:56,084 --> 00:57:57,628
- Tell them they can go now.
- Okay.

856
00:58:07,104 --> 00:58:08,479
I guess they left.

857
00:58:30,754 --> 00:58:33,128
Yes, Auntie. Are you with my mom?

858
00:58:33,493 --> 00:58:35,398
We're in the room right now.

859
00:58:37,393 --> 00:58:39,909
It's dangerous,
so please don't leave the room.

860
00:58:40,134 --> 00:58:42,479
There's a murder suspect in that hospital.

861
00:58:43,464 --> 00:58:44,648
Don't let my mom...

862
00:58:45,203 --> 00:58:47,249
wander about until I arrive.

863
00:58:48,803 --> 00:58:49,918
Okay.

864
00:59:02,953 --> 00:59:04,068
Auntie.

865
00:59:05,154 --> 00:59:06,269
Auntie.

866
00:59:42,524 --> 00:59:43,599
(Chungrim Mental Hospital)

867
01:00:49,823 --> 01:00:51,039
Auntie.

868
01:00:55,504 --> 01:00:58,679
You can't let him out.

869
01:01:34,604 --> 01:01:35,979
(Catch the Ghost)

870
01:01:36,544 --> 01:01:38,789
There's a good chance
he's still in the hospital.

871
01:01:38,814 --> 01:01:42,959
Did Kim Chul Jin have something to do
with those serial murders?

872
01:01:43,183 --> 01:01:44,814
Don't be too bitter.

873
01:01:44,814 --> 01:01:46,429
I'm the victim.

874
01:01:46,484 --> 01:01:47,798
Victim.

875
01:01:47,984 --> 01:01:49,798
Isn't my mom in her room?

876
01:01:49,854 --> 01:01:51,298
Where did she go?

877
01:01:51,823 --> 01:01:54,723
I'll get you back for all of it.

878
01:01:54,723 --> 01:01:56,099
Step on it.

879
01:01:58,093 --> 01:02:00,263
My sister. Where's my sister?

880
01:02:00,263 --> 01:02:02,679
What did you do with my sister?

881
01:02:02,964 --> 01:02:04,209
Ryung.
