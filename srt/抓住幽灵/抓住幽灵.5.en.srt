00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,600
CATCH THE GHOST

2
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,867
{\an8}CATCH THE GHOST

3
00:00:24,934 --> 00:00:25,867
THIS DRAMA IS FICTION

4
00:00:25,934 --> 00:00:27,834
THE CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
INSTITUTIONS, AND EVENTS AREN'T REAL

5
00:00:28,834 --> 00:00:29,967
{\an8}PREVIOUSLY

6
00:00:30,033 --> 00:00:32,934
{\an8}<i>He was selected
as the number one guy people want</i>

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,266
{\an8}<i>as a bodyguard on the subway.</i>

8
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:35,967
{\an8}-I'm Kim Won-tae.
-Nice to meet you.

9
00:00:38,667 --> 00:00:41,333
{\an8}<i>I think Kim Won-tae assaults his fiancée.</i>

10
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,166
{\an8}<i>The ambassador committed
domestic violence?</i>

11
00:00:46,467 --> 00:00:47,967
{\an8}-Cover it up.
-Cover it up?

12
00:00:50,834 --> 00:00:52,133
{\an8}Stop it.

13
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,066
{\an8}I will report you for real.

14
00:00:54,133 --> 00:00:55,300
{\an8}Report me?

15
00:00:58,367 --> 00:01:00,767
{\an8}-Wait. What are you doing?
-Ms. Ma!

16
00:01:00,834 --> 00:01:01,834
{\an8}Are you okay?

17
00:01:02,133 --> 00:01:04,033
{\an8}You are under arrest
for assault in the act.

18
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:07,233
{\an8}You have the right to an attorney
and have the right to explain yourself.

19
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:09,333
{\an8}Hye-jin!

20
00:01:09,967 --> 00:01:11,266
{\an8}How dare you!

21
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,033
{\an8}Hye-jin!

22
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,934
{\an8}If this gets in my way,

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
{\an8}my life and our future
will fall apart, too.

24
00:01:19,066 --> 00:01:21,967
{\an8}I'm so sorry. Please forgive me.

25
00:01:22,033 --> 00:01:24,266
-Look at me.
-That's enough.

26
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:25,567
Hye-jin!

27
00:01:25,633 --> 00:01:27,033
I won't report him.

28
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,233
Ms. Ma.

29
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,033
The second offense rate
of domestic violence is over 70 percent.

30
00:01:31,467 --> 00:01:32,900
Please reconsider.

31
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:34,600
It will be okay if I behave.

32
00:01:34,667 --> 00:01:36,266
I got hit because I misbehaved.

33
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,100
This is his way of loving me.

34
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,667
I love him and even his way of loving me.

35
00:01:43,233 --> 00:01:46,934
Violence is not a way to show love.

36
00:01:50,667 --> 00:01:51,533
You can't go inside.

37
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,567
-Hye-jin!
-Kim Won-tae.

38
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,433
Hye-jin, I am so sorry.

39
00:01:54,934 --> 00:01:57,233
Hye-jin.

40
00:02:00,567 --> 00:02:01,467
Captain, take this.

41
00:02:03,233 --> 00:02:04,600
I ran a check on KICS.

42
00:02:04,834 --> 00:02:07,433
Kim Won-tae was investigated
as a witness nine years ago.

43
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,333
What case was it?

44
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,433
Hyeon Mi-yeong's murder by a robber case.

45
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,567
Ms. Hyeon, who was 20 years old,
was killed in an alley.

46
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:16,400
She was Kim Won-tae's girlfriend
back then.

47
00:02:17,533 --> 00:02:19,734
Kim Won-tae's ex-girlfriend got killed?

48
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,700
The cause of death was a brain hemorrhage.

49
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,166
The autopsy report showed

50
00:02:23,633 --> 00:02:25,800
that a brain hemorrhage
was caused by an assault.

51
00:02:26,367 --> 00:02:28,166
She was beaten up to death?

52
00:02:28,233 --> 00:02:30,500
Was the murder suspect Kim Won-tae?

53
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:34,934
No. He had an alibi,
so he was only investigated as a witness.

54
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,667
Mugging was common in that alley
that Hyeon Mi-yeong died in,

55
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:41,600
and her ring and purse were missing,
so it was closed as murder by a robber.

56
00:02:42,734 --> 00:02:44,000
This is the case file.

57
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,667
HYEON MI-YEONG'S MURDER BY A ROBBER CASE

58
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,834
STOLEN ARTICLES

59
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,233
<i>I told you to be careful.</i>

60
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:03,433
She fell while she was rushing back
to take care of an urgent business.

61
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,066
Ms. Ma has

62
00:03:09,367 --> 00:03:10,400
the stolen ring.

63
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,233
Listen...

64
00:03:15,934 --> 00:03:16,800
Hye-jin.

65
00:03:18,633 --> 00:03:19,533
Let's go.

66
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,233
I'm not reporting him.

67
00:03:26,033 --> 00:03:26,867
What?

68
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,633
Wait...

69
00:03:30,467 --> 00:03:31,367
Uncuff me now.

70
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,467
Thanks, Hye-jin.

71
00:03:43,934 --> 00:03:45,133
I won't ever do it again.

72
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,433
Let's go.

73
00:03:49,533 --> 00:03:51,500
Wait, Ms. Ma.

74
00:03:51,567 --> 00:03:54,667
Rookie, let them go.
This isn't for us to get involved in.

75
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:55,567
Captain.

76
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,100
Just give me a minute.

77
00:03:58,967 --> 00:04:00,066
One minute and no more.

78
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,600
Mr. Kim. Come this way, please.

79
00:04:05,667 --> 00:04:06,967
Take your time.

80
00:04:19,767 --> 00:04:21,767
Where's the ring
that you were wearing earlier?

81
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,233
Why do you ask?

82
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,200
Mr. Kim gave it to you, right?

83
00:04:38,567 --> 00:04:40,967
Mr. Kim's ex-girlfriend was murdered.

84
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,767
That ring disappeared
from the murder scene.

85
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,567
Let's go home, Hye-jin.

86
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:56,100
If you submit it as evidence,
we'll check it and give it right back.

87
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:03,467
No, he wouldn't kill someone.

88
00:05:04,133 --> 00:05:04,967
Ms. Ma.

89
00:05:05,533 --> 00:05:07,300
You could be in danger, too.

90
00:05:07,767 --> 00:05:10,166
You must not go back home with him.

91
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,900
Imagine how heartbroken your family
would be if they found out.

92
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,767
I don't have that ring.

93
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,467
Goodbye.

94
00:05:40,867 --> 00:05:43,800
Rookie, are you sure she had the ring?

95
00:05:43,867 --> 00:05:44,934
I'm sure.

96
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,800
It was definitely the same ring.

97
00:05:48,533 --> 00:05:50,166
Ms. Ma is hiding it.

98
00:05:50,233 --> 00:05:53,900
It could be evidence of murder.
She would've submitted it if she'd had it.

99
00:05:53,967 --> 00:05:55,333
She said she loves him,

100
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,166
but I don't understand.

101
00:05:57,233 --> 00:05:58,066
Love, my foot.

102
00:05:58,133 --> 00:06:00,133
I'm sure she's being blackmailed
or something.

103
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,467
It's obvious.

104
00:06:01,533 --> 00:06:02,633
Let's hand over the case.

105
00:06:03,433 --> 00:06:06,000
I'll call the detective who was
in charge of Hyeon Mi-yeong's case.

106
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,333
Tell the detective that you saw the ring.

107
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,000
We could hand over the murder case,
but what about Ms. Ma?

108
00:06:11,066 --> 00:06:14,133
She is a victim that we must save.

109
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,200
Trying to talk to Ms. Ma
will only provoke Kim Won-tae.

110
00:06:17,266 --> 00:06:18,734
Ms. Ma will be safe

111
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,000
only if Kim Won-tae is arrested.

112
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:24,934
So let's have faith in the detectives
in charge of Hyeon Mi-yeong's case.

113
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,767
-Captain.
-Rookie.

114
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:30,166
That's enough.

115
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,133
This is my last warning.

116
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,166
Thank you for trusting me earlier.

117
00:06:50,233 --> 00:06:53,533
Now I have confidence
that you love me very much.

118
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:55,166
Sure.

119
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,667
-Hye-jin.
-What?

120
00:06:59,734 --> 00:07:02,800
I want to have your bean sprout soup.

121
00:07:03,967 --> 00:07:04,867
Okay.

122
00:07:05,867 --> 00:07:07,867
No. I'll clean this up.

123
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,600
Then I'll go get some groceries.

124
00:07:12,567 --> 00:07:13,967
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

125
00:07:34,867 --> 00:07:37,333
Then at least notify her family.

126
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,033
Her family could get her
out of the house, at least.

127
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,633
She doesn't have a family.

128
00:07:44,033 --> 00:07:45,166
She doesn't have a family?

129
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:46,767
No one at all?

130
00:07:46,834 --> 00:07:48,300
No parents, siblings, or grandparents?

131
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:49,400
She has no one.

132
00:07:53,533 --> 00:07:55,767
I'll be right back, Captain.

133
00:07:56,467 --> 00:07:58,734
Don't go there.

134
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:05,000
Don't go.

135
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,734
I'm sorry.

136
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,533
Is she going back to Kim Won-tae?

137
00:08:24,633 --> 00:08:27,533
He beats his fiancée, and he's a fighter.

138
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,700
I'll go with her.

139
00:08:28,767 --> 00:08:31,734
Oh, come on.
We can't focus on the Locust Swarm

140
00:08:32,266 --> 00:08:34,166
-because of the mess she's creating.
-Leave her be.

141
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,467
I'm not going to care anymore.

142
00:08:36,533 --> 00:08:38,700
How can you not care? She's your partner.

143
00:08:38,767 --> 00:08:40,000
I know you can't not care.

144
00:08:40,066 --> 00:08:41,033
So I'll transfer her

145
00:08:42,266 --> 00:08:44,133
-to a different team.
-What?

146
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,033
Sit down.

147
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,700
Where did it go?

148
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,333
Hye-jin.

149
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:27,800
What are you doing?

150
00:09:29,567 --> 00:09:30,500
I'm hungry.

151
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,233
Right.

152
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:35,800
It'll be ready soon.

153
00:09:52,667 --> 00:09:53,533
<i>Hello?</i>

154
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,533
Ms. Ma, this is Detective Yoo Ryeong.

155
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,667
I'm in front of your house.

156
00:09:59,734 --> 00:10:01,500
Can we talk outside for a bit?

157
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,333
<i>I told you that I don't have the ring.</i>

158
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:26,734
<i>Please leave.</i>

159
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,900
<i>I'm not here to catch a murderer.</i>

160
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,400
<i>Then what is it?</i>

161
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,133
<i>Well...</i>

162
00:10:37,633 --> 00:10:40,600
My sister is my only family.

163
00:10:42,066 --> 00:10:42,934
But...

164
00:10:44,133 --> 00:10:47,100
I don't know whether she is alive or not

165
00:10:47,967 --> 00:10:49,233
because some bastard...

166
00:10:54,467 --> 00:10:57,700
I'm going to get him.

167
00:10:59,066 --> 00:11:00,333
I'm going to catch him

168
00:11:01,767 --> 00:11:03,867
and make him pay for what he did.

169
00:11:05,367 --> 00:11:06,533
But if...

170
00:11:08,233 --> 00:11:09,633
If my sister is dead...

171
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,467
It'll be pointless

172
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,367
even if I make him pay.

173
00:11:20,834 --> 00:11:24,700
<i>Even without that ring,
Kim Won-tae will be caught one day,</i>

174
00:11:25,433 --> 00:11:27,133
<i>and he will pay for what he did.</i>

175
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,867
But if something happens
to you before then...

176
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,333
That will be irrevocable.

177
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,533
Ms. Ma.

178
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,200
I know why

179
00:11:48,967 --> 00:11:50,100
you're covering for him.

180
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:56,266
When I asked you

181
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:58,166
how worried your family would be,

182
00:11:59,633 --> 00:12:03,734
you covered for him
by saying that you don't have the ring.

183
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,333
Kim Won-tae was...

184
00:12:09,367 --> 00:12:10,734
family to you, right?

185
00:12:15,433 --> 00:12:17,166
I know how lonely it feels...

186
00:12:19,266 --> 00:12:20,934
to be without any family.

187
00:12:22,667 --> 00:12:26,166
But this is wrong.

188
00:12:27,967 --> 00:12:29,333
Come stay with me.

189
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,233
Come eat with me,

190
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,066
go shopping with me, and go for a walk.

191
00:12:35,867 --> 00:12:37,367
That's what a family does.

192
00:12:41,633 --> 00:12:43,533
I'll help you get away...

193
00:12:45,667 --> 00:12:47,100
from Kim Won-tae.

194
00:13:48,467 --> 00:13:51,667
-Yes?
<i>-Return right now. I need to talk to you.</i>

195
00:15:35,233 --> 00:15:37,700
I'm on my way, Captain.

196
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,800
I'm two stations away.

197
00:15:41,667 --> 00:15:42,767
I'm sorry.

198
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,633
<i>Forget it. We'll talk when you get here.</i>

199
00:15:48,467 --> 00:15:49,300
Okay.

200
00:15:53,633 --> 00:15:54,834
By the way...

201
00:15:56,567 --> 00:15:58,734
Captain... Yes.

202
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,166
I'll be there as soon as I can.

203
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,133
<i>Hello?</i>

204
00:16:24,633 --> 00:16:25,467
<i>Rookie.</i>

205
00:16:26,567 --> 00:16:27,400
<i>Rookie!</i>

206
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,633
<i>Is something wrong? Hello?</i>

207
00:16:31,367 --> 00:16:32,200
<i>Rookie!</i>

208
00:17:02,433 --> 00:17:03,266
Rookie.

209
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,033
What about her?

210
00:17:07,533 --> 00:17:09,600
-Captain.
-Captain!

211
00:17:10,066 --> 00:17:11,900
She said she was two stations away.
Search the trains.

212
00:17:11,967 --> 00:17:13,734
Yes. Line Two to Sindorim,

213
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,066
-Line Five going to Gunja...
-A Gyeongui Jungang train arrives soon.

214
00:17:16,133 --> 00:17:17,734
Detective Lee,
get on the Gyeongui Jungang Line.

215
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,533
I'll get on Line Two.
Su-ho, get on Line Five.

216
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,533
We can't lose her.

217
00:17:22,934 --> 00:17:23,834
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

218
00:17:42,867 --> 00:17:44,667
Rookie.

219
00:18:00,633 --> 00:18:01,467
Rookie.

220
00:18:01,533 --> 00:18:02,433
Rookie!

221
00:18:05,266 --> 00:18:06,133
Rookie.

222
00:18:10,433 --> 00:18:11,600
Rookie.

223
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,867
What happened to you?

224
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,567
Kim Won-tae did it.

225
00:18:19,867 --> 00:18:20,700
Kim Won-tae?

226
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,767
He did this to you?

227
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,734
Rookie.

228
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,967
Stay with me.

229
00:18:28,467 --> 00:18:30,467
Can you hear me?

230
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,033
Rookie.

231
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:33,200
Rookie!

232
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,533
Hang in there.

233
00:18:46,467 --> 00:18:49,633
I need you to hang in there, Rookie.

234
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,633
Come on. Stay with me.

235
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:56,934
There's been an accident
at Wangsuri Station.

236
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,300
Her head is bleeding,

237
00:19:02,233 --> 00:19:04,433
and she's unconscious.

238
00:19:05,467 --> 00:19:07,033
We're at...

239
00:19:07,633 --> 00:19:11,266
Send an ambulance immediately
to Sangwangsuri Station Exit One.

240
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,734
Hurry!

241
00:19:14,533 --> 00:19:17,166
<i>This stop is Sangwangsuri.</i>

242
00:19:17,567 --> 00:19:20,066
I'm sorry.

243
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,066
<i>The doors are opening.</i>

244
00:19:31,767 --> 00:19:33,166
It's an urgent patient.

245
00:19:40,834 --> 00:19:42,867
Her wounds are deep,
and she's bleeding excessively.

246
00:19:42,934 --> 00:19:44,734
I'll get a CT scan of her brain first.

247
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,934
Get it ready now.

248
00:19:49,567 --> 00:19:51,100
This is an emergency. Please move.

249
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,166
Yes, Detective Lee.

250
00:20:03,667 --> 00:20:04,867
Kim Won-tae did this.

251
00:20:07,033 --> 00:20:09,333
Get every security footage
that captured Kim Won-tae.

252
00:20:10,934 --> 00:20:12,433
Zoom in.

253
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,033
That sly bastard.

254
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,000
He knew there weren't
any security cameras on the subways

255
00:20:16,066 --> 00:20:17,200
and beat her up there.

256
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:21,767
We must find footage that shows
he got on the subway with Rookie.

257
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,700
Oh, that's her.

258
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:28,166
Yes.

259
00:20:28,767 --> 00:20:33,333
But this guy here doesn't have
Kim Won-tae's build.

260
00:20:33,767 --> 00:20:34,600
Look carefully.

261
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:36,700
You're right.

262
00:20:40,533 --> 00:20:41,367
I found him.

263
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,300
Yes, Detective Lee?

264
00:20:52,367 --> 00:20:55,200
<i>I found a man who was tailing Rookie,</i>

265
00:20:55,767 --> 00:20:58,633
but we can't tell
if it's Kim Won-tae or not.

266
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:02,200
<i>We may not be able to get him.</i>

267
00:21:03,033 --> 00:21:04,033
All right.

268
00:21:14,934 --> 00:21:16,667
DETECTIVE YOO

269
00:21:23,767 --> 00:21:25,367
DETECTIVE YOO

270
00:21:51,633 --> 00:21:52,700
Won-tae.

271
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,700
That female detective seemed
to be harassing you.

272
00:22:04,033 --> 00:22:05,300
But don't worry anymore.

273
00:22:06,266 --> 00:22:09,233
What did you do?

274
00:22:10,767 --> 00:22:12,066
Does it matter?

275
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:14,000
Does it?

276
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:19,734
Right.

277
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,567
If the police come,
tell them that I've been training here.

278
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:26,166
Okay?

279
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,834
I love you.

280
00:22:49,667 --> 00:22:51,900
<i>I know how lonely it feels</i>

281
00:22:51,967 --> 00:22:54,967
<i>to be without any family.</i>

282
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:57,967
<i>Come stay with me.</i>

283
00:22:58,667 --> 00:23:00,934
<i>Come eat with me and go for a walk.</i>

284
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,533
<i>That's what a family does.</i>

285
00:23:06,433 --> 00:23:08,300
<i>I'll help you get away</i>

286
00:23:09,233 --> 00:23:10,600
<i>from Kim Won-tae.</i>

287
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:47,400
RESIDENT REGISTRATION CARD
HYEON MI-YEONG

288
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:54,266
Hye-jin.

289
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,800
Trust is the most important thing

290
00:24:04,633 --> 00:24:06,100
in a loving relationship.

291
00:24:06,934 --> 00:24:07,867
Isn't that right?

292
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:32,066
<i>I need you by my side.</i>

293
00:24:33,533 --> 00:24:35,133
<i>When I was on the scooter,</i>

294
00:24:36,133 --> 00:24:38,100
<i>you on the back seat</i>

295
00:24:39,567 --> 00:24:41,033
<i>felt like my seatbelt.</i>

296
00:24:48,333 --> 00:24:49,734
Are you awake now?

297
00:24:54,934 --> 00:24:56,900
Can you give me
your family's contact number?

298
00:24:56,967 --> 00:24:58,667
I need your guardian's signature...

299
00:24:58,734 --> 00:24:59,800
My family?

300
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,767
I'm her guardian.

301
00:25:05,333 --> 00:25:06,233
Rookie.

302
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,533
You're awake.

303
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,467
Captain.

304
00:25:15,333 --> 00:25:18,567
I'll go and sign the papers soon.

305
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,633
Get some more sleep.

306
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,333
Okay.

307
00:25:28,734 --> 00:25:31,433
But what about him?

308
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,934
Don't think about anything else

309
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,800
and get some rest for now.

310
00:25:46,834 --> 00:25:48,700
Thank you, Captain.

311
00:25:51,166 --> 00:25:52,467
Thank you for saving my life.

312
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,667
Does being a police officer

313
00:26:54,133 --> 00:26:57,600
give you the right to trespass
someone else's house?

314
00:26:57,667 --> 00:26:58,500
Does it?

315
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,834
What is it this time?

316
00:27:02,333 --> 00:27:04,500
There can't be anything else
you can accuse me of.

317
00:27:06,533 --> 00:27:08,333
Jeez, you scared me.

318
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,633
Hit me.

319
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,233
What?

320
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,033
Don't you need a sparring partner?

321
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,333
I'll be one, so hit me.

322
00:27:31,767 --> 00:27:33,166
What are you trying to pull now?

323
00:27:33,233 --> 00:27:34,166
I was...

324
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,333
supposed to be there with her.

325
00:27:41,533 --> 00:27:43,333
Police officers must be in teams of two.

326
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,033
An officer must not leave
their partner's side.

327
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:50,633
So I was supposed to be

328
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,333
on that train with her.

329
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,667
I should've been beaten up with her.

330
00:28:00,734 --> 00:28:03,500
So hit me like you would've
if I had been there.

331
00:28:04,033 --> 00:28:06,233
I'm not sure if I'm following.

332
00:28:06,767 --> 00:28:09,133
But I'll hit you, too.

333
00:28:12,867 --> 00:28:14,633
It will hurt quite a bit if I hit you.

334
00:28:15,867 --> 00:28:18,066
Not that I care.

335
00:28:20,266 --> 00:28:23,200
Don't blame me later.

336
00:28:38,066 --> 00:28:38,900
Get up.

337
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,834
Get up.

338
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,533
Get up.

339
00:29:36,533 --> 00:29:37,700
It hurts.

340
00:29:37,767 --> 00:29:40,867
I told you earlier
that it would hurt if I hit you.

341
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,533
This is no fun.

342
00:29:46,934 --> 00:29:47,800
Get up.

343
00:29:48,367 --> 00:29:49,266
Get up!

344
00:29:50,934 --> 00:29:51,767
Come on.

345
00:30:00,033 --> 00:30:01,400
That's not what I meant.

346
00:30:04,367 --> 00:30:06,133
It hurts my heart.

347
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:11,533
My heart breaks!

348
00:31:05,667 --> 00:31:09,367
Don't ever mess
with my partner ever again.

349
00:31:10,133 --> 00:31:12,900
I hold a total of 18 dan
in martial arts, too!

350
00:31:13,667 --> 00:31:14,900
You bastard.

351
00:31:19,567 --> 00:31:21,767
Ms. Ma.

352
00:31:26,233 --> 00:31:28,433
Ms. Ma!

353
00:31:33,734 --> 00:31:34,700
Ms. Ma.

354
00:31:37,934 --> 00:31:39,567
I'm sorry, Won-tae.

355
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,100
It's the police, Ms. Ma.

356
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,066
What happened to Kim Won-tae?

357
00:32:08,867 --> 00:32:09,867
Captain.

358
00:32:09,934 --> 00:32:11,967
Are you all right? What happened to you?

359
00:32:15,567 --> 00:32:16,734
Did you two fight?

360
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,200
Did you really fight against him?

361
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:25,400
Gosh!

362
00:32:25,467 --> 00:32:27,967
If I were a woman,
I would've confessed my love to you.

363
00:32:33,533 --> 00:32:35,233
Don't blame me.

364
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,033
Let's go.

365
00:32:42,567 --> 00:32:44,400
You're being arrested.
Why are you smiling?

366
00:32:45,467 --> 00:32:46,700
-Come.
-Get in.

367
00:32:47,433 --> 00:32:49,667
-Get in.
-Let go of me.

368
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,000
-Hold him.
-Okay.

369
00:32:55,266 --> 00:32:57,233
SEOUN POLICE HOSPITAL

370
00:33:11,633 --> 00:33:12,467
Come sit.

371
00:33:14,633 --> 00:33:15,900
Have a seat here.

372
00:33:21,133 --> 00:33:23,467
I'm sorry. It's all because of me.

373
00:33:24,166 --> 00:33:26,667
Are you all right?

374
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,033
When he'd beat me...

375
00:33:33,233 --> 00:33:34,967
Looking into his eyes...

376
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,333
scared me the most.

377
00:33:40,834 --> 00:33:42,400
He had a murderous look in his eyes.

378
00:33:44,967 --> 00:33:46,100
I really thought

379
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,400
he could beat me to death.

380
00:33:51,667 --> 00:33:54,834
But you see...

381
00:33:57,533 --> 00:33:59,200
Becoming alone again scared me more...

382
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,734
than the idea of death did.

383
00:34:08,333 --> 00:34:12,734
No one's ever cared for me the way you do.

384
00:34:24,467 --> 00:34:25,533
I'm sure

385
00:34:27,333 --> 00:34:28,934
she was very lonely, too.

386
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:33,233
Even after she died, not a single person

387
00:34:35,066 --> 00:34:39,300
looked into how she died.

388
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,600
Thank you for plucking up your courage.

389
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:51,633
I heard that you will stay at a shelter.

390
00:34:54,066 --> 00:34:55,066
But let's still

391
00:34:56,266 --> 00:34:58,800
go for walks and eat together.

392
00:35:00,266 --> 00:35:01,100
Okay.

393
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,800
But you already seem to have a family.

394
00:35:08,266 --> 00:35:09,100
What?

395
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,300
Get well soon.

396
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,467
You too.

397
00:35:23,767 --> 00:35:24,600
Okay.

398
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,233
<i>So I was supposed to be
on that train with her.</i>

399
00:35:41,734 --> 00:35:43,433
<i>I should've been beaten up with her.</i>

400
00:35:45,533 --> 00:35:48,834
<i>So hit me like you would've
if I had been there.</i>

401
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,633
<i>Hit me, too!</i>

402
00:36:06,066 --> 00:36:07,000
<i>Get up!</i>

403
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,633
<i>Come on.</i>

404
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,433
<i>It hurts my heart.</i>

405
00:36:14,867 --> 00:36:17,200
<i>My heart breaks!</i>

406
00:36:33,667 --> 00:36:35,800
Your bruise is getting bigger.

407
00:36:36,567 --> 00:36:38,200
Are you hurt anywhere else?

408
00:36:39,967 --> 00:36:40,867
Gosh.

409
00:36:45,033 --> 00:36:46,166
What is it?

410
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:48,834
What happened...

411
00:36:50,967 --> 00:36:52,166
to your face?

412
00:36:53,867 --> 00:36:54,734
Right.

413
00:36:55,567 --> 00:36:56,500
Last night...

414
00:36:58,367 --> 00:37:00,633
I was in a good mood
after catching the bad guy.

415
00:37:02,433 --> 00:37:03,667
I got drunk and tripped.

416
00:37:13,967 --> 00:37:16,133
Right. I must go to my desk
to organize my office.

417
00:37:19,533 --> 00:37:20,400
See you later.

418
00:37:33,667 --> 00:37:34,667
Rest up.

419
00:37:42,066 --> 00:37:43,000
I'm the same.

420
00:37:45,233 --> 00:37:46,533
My heart breaks, too.

421
00:37:54,633 --> 00:37:57,333
Domestic violence is unacceptable.
Give him a heavy punishment!

422
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,133
-Give him a heavy punishment!
-Give him a heavy punishment!

423
00:38:01,233 --> 00:38:03,767
There are so many reporters out there.

424
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,400
We get to be on TV, thanks to Rookie.

425
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:11,567
Will you really transfer her
to another team?

426
00:38:11,633 --> 00:38:14,967
No, she's too much to handle.
People will hate me.

427
00:38:15,934 --> 00:38:17,367
She's my responsibility.

428
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:21,533
Let's go.

429
00:38:21,934 --> 00:38:22,934
-Okay.
-Okay.

430
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,367
-Here he comes!
-He's here.

431
00:38:33,433 --> 00:38:35,834
Punish murder suspect Kim Won-tae!

432
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,633
How do you feel, Mr. Kim?

433
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,900
-Do you admit to your charge?
-Domestic violence is unacceptable.

434
00:38:39,967 --> 00:38:40,900
Give him a heavy punishment!

435
00:38:40,967 --> 00:38:42,934
-Give him a heavy punishment!
-Give him a heavy punishment!

436
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,667
-Punish murder...
-A word, please!

437
00:38:44,734 --> 00:38:46,900
Since when have you been assaulting women?

438
00:38:46,967 --> 00:38:48,166
"Fierce Fist" Kim Won-tae has become

439
00:38:48,233 --> 00:38:51,033
the main suspect in the murder
that happened nine years ago

440
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,934
and is being transferred
to Gangnam Police Station,

441
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,700
which was in charge of the murder case.

442
00:38:55,033 --> 00:38:57,367
<i>He was charged with assaulting an officer
and domestic violence,</i>

443
00:38:57,433 --> 00:39:00,600
{\an8}<i>and now he's been charged with murder.</i>

444
00:39:01,133 --> 00:39:04,066
{\an8}<i>Kim Won-tae headed
into the investigation room</i>

445
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:05,700
<i>without answering any questions.</i>

446
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,934
-You must watch the news, ma'am.
<i>-He hit his partner...</i>

447
00:39:13,467 --> 00:39:14,433
{\an8}KIM WON-TAE INVESTIGATED FOR MURDER

448
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:17,133
{\an8}He was chosen as the ambassador
of the Subway Police.

449
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,166
I caught him early on
before things got worse

450
00:39:19,233 --> 00:39:21,700
and told Captain Ko to solve the case.

451
00:39:22,266 --> 00:39:23,233
Ji-seok?

452
00:39:24,233 --> 00:39:26,433
He should be going after the Locust Swarm.

453
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,734
{\an8}Ji-seok solved the case?

454
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,467
{\an8}What happened to his face?

455
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:35,467
I guess he went through a ruckus
to catch Kim Won-tae.

456
00:39:35,533 --> 00:39:36,800
The rumor has it

457
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,033
that he fought against Kim Won-tae.

458
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:44,734
Apparently, he lost it
after Kim Won-tae beat up his partner.

459
00:39:51,033 --> 00:39:52,967
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

460
00:39:53,033 --> 00:39:54,600
Congratulations on your recovery!

461
00:39:54,667 --> 00:39:56,800
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

462
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,367
I couldn't stand the hospital food.

463
00:40:03,433 --> 00:40:04,734
May I eat some real food now?

464
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,867
You ate so well, though.

465
00:40:06,633 --> 00:40:08,600
You ate three bowls of rice.

466
00:40:08,667 --> 00:40:10,200
Eat up.

467
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,000
Thank you.

468
00:40:12,066 --> 00:40:13,667
Dear my partner.

469
00:40:13,734 --> 00:40:15,433
-What?
-Here you go.

470
00:40:16,233 --> 00:40:17,133
Have your fill.

471
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:19,967
-I'll make you a wrap.
-Sure.

472
00:40:20,934 --> 00:40:22,400
You eat it.

473
00:40:22,467 --> 00:40:24,066
-What was that?
-Sorry. You saw that?

474
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,000
I bought this to give it
to my partner when I got one.

475
00:40:28,066 --> 00:40:30,400
I finally get to give it to you.

476
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:38,967
You know what this is, right?

477
00:40:39,033 --> 00:40:41,867
Of course. This is premium stuff.

478
00:40:41,934 --> 00:40:43,533
It's a 26-inch Duralumin baton.

479
00:40:44,834 --> 00:40:47,467
I've always wanted this.

480
00:40:49,033 --> 00:40:51,867
Thank you, Partner.

481
00:40:51,934 --> 00:40:55,333
Women normally react like that
when they get a designer bag.

482
00:40:57,066 --> 00:40:57,900
Partner.

483
00:40:58,333 --> 00:41:00,500
I've always wanted that, too.

484
00:41:00,567 --> 00:41:02,033
Me too, Partner.

485
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,900
Enjoy.

486
00:41:03,967 --> 00:41:04,867
I'll get you one.

487
00:41:12,066 --> 00:41:14,300
Thank you so much.

488
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:22,767
Stop bragging and have a drink.

489
00:41:23,934 --> 00:41:25,800
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

490
00:41:25,867 --> 00:41:27,867
Next round is on me.

491
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:41,433
KONKUK UNIVERSITY STATION

492
00:41:47,734 --> 00:41:49,066
What's this?

493
00:41:49,133 --> 00:41:53,033
I forgot to hand this over
with Kim Won-tae's case file.

494
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,533
It's the security footage of Kim Won-tae.

495
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,500
I'll send it now.

496
00:41:55,567 --> 00:41:56,967
No, not that.

497
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:03,600
-Who is this man?
-What?

498
00:42:03,667 --> 00:42:05,266
He looks like he's tailing Rookie.

499
00:42:06,467 --> 00:42:07,400
Tailing me?

500
00:42:09,767 --> 00:42:11,033
Hold on.

501
00:42:15,133 --> 00:42:16,400
Do you know who he is?

502
00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:18,400
Do you have an inkling of who it may be?

503
00:42:18,467 --> 00:42:19,433
Let me think.

504
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:39,767
<i>Come out.</i>

505
00:42:41,033 --> 00:42:42,266
Come out!

506
00:42:43,667 --> 00:42:45,867
Come out and tell me where my sister is!

507
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:56,233
Can you think of anyone?

508
00:42:59,734 --> 00:43:02,500
No, I can't.

509
00:43:09,133 --> 00:43:11,567
Give me a copy of it.

510
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:16,567
Oh, I'm late.

511
00:43:17,867 --> 00:43:19,233
I'm going home now.

512
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:20,800
-Okay.
-Okay.

513
00:43:21,233 --> 00:43:22,867
-Good night.
-Good work today.

514
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:24,100
-Good night.
-See you.

515
00:43:24,166 --> 00:43:25,000
Bye.

516
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:46,900
<i>Someone is definitely watching me.</i>

517
00:43:48,266 --> 00:43:51,200
Your mother is near the supply room.

518
00:43:51,266 --> 00:43:54,266
It must be because she's young.
She's full of curiosity.

519
00:43:55,467 --> 00:43:58,266
She looks around the hospital every day.

520
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,400
The caregiver will bring her to her room,

521
00:44:03,467 --> 00:44:04,500
so you can wait there.

522
00:44:04,567 --> 00:44:05,934
-I see. Thank you.
-Sure.

523
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:22,467
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

524
00:44:22,533 --> 00:44:23,900
Oh, I'm sorry.

525
00:44:24,967 --> 00:44:27,300
-It's dirty.
-It's okay. I'll do it.

526
00:44:36,633 --> 00:44:39,500
I've made a list of all ex-cons and people

527
00:44:39,567 --> 00:44:41,066
who were investigated as witnesses,

528
00:44:41,133 --> 00:44:44,233
and they're all within the 3 km radius
around the phone booth he used.

529
00:44:46,867 --> 00:44:48,333
These are the houses we'll search.

530
00:44:50,133 --> 00:44:52,500
Divide up the houses as written here.

531
00:44:53,567 --> 00:44:55,734
Get started now.
I have to make a stop first.

532
00:44:57,066 --> 00:44:57,900
Where?

533
00:45:00,467 --> 00:45:02,266
Right, it's time for the phone call.

534
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:04,767
Good luck.

535
00:45:24,834 --> 00:45:25,867
<i>Nine o'clock.</i>

536
00:45:28,834 --> 00:45:31,734
<i>The murderer called
the fourth victim here.</i>

537
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:35,734
<i>What did he say
to get the victim to come out?</i>

538
00:45:37,567 --> 00:45:40,667
<i>The number you have dialed
is not in service.</i>

539
00:45:40,734 --> 00:45:42,367
<i>Please check the number and call back.</i>

540
00:45:47,667 --> 00:45:50,633
<i>The phone booth is
near an unfrequented stream,</i>

541
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:53,433
<i>hidden by the trees, and there's no light.</i>

542
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:59,633
<i>It's hard to find this booth
unless you live here.</i>

543
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:04,033
<i>He must live close by.</i>

544
00:46:48,233 --> 00:46:50,066
<i>A passage that's not on the blueprint?</i>

545
00:47:08,333 --> 00:47:11,333
<i>Where does this passage lead to?</i>

546
00:47:24,533 --> 00:47:27,233
They are finally coming tonight.

547
00:47:27,834 --> 00:47:30,734
These are the locations
where they might commit a crime.

548
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,967
Their methods are getting
more malicious each time.

549
00:47:34,033 --> 00:47:35,734
If we're not well-prepared,
they'll get us.

550
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:40,200
-How many do you think there will be?
-Probably over 50.

551
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:45,900
What are you doing here? You should sleep.

552
00:47:46,433 --> 00:47:48,367
What is over 50?

553
00:47:48,433 --> 00:47:49,567
The number of perverts.

554
00:47:50,667 --> 00:47:51,800
HOW TO GET PERVERTS ON HONGDAE CLUB DAY

555
00:47:51,867 --> 00:47:53,667
Perverts are coming
from all over the country.

556
00:47:53,734 --> 00:47:54,934
Listen up!

557
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,567
It's the end of the quarter.

558
00:47:56,633 --> 00:47:58,533
Our performance evaluation is coming up,

559
00:47:58,600 --> 00:47:59,767
but we're behind.

560
00:47:59,834 --> 00:48:01,333
If we place number one,

561
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:04,333
will that be considered
when they decide on your penalty?

562
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:08,100
-Well, a little...
-It will definitely be considered.

563
00:48:08,166 --> 00:48:09,467
When deciding on a penalty,

564
00:48:09,533 --> 00:48:13,367
they consider the detective's
attitude and performance.

565
00:48:13,433 --> 00:48:16,000
Then I'll do whatever it takes
to catch those perverts.

566
00:48:16,066 --> 00:48:17,800
Look at you!

567
00:48:17,867 --> 00:48:20,266
You never used to listen to him.

568
00:48:20,333 --> 00:48:22,867
Is this the power of the police baton?

569
00:48:23,834 --> 00:48:27,166
I owe you a lot, Captain.

570
00:48:27,233 --> 00:48:29,834
This is how I'll repay you. Salute!

571
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,333
Salute!

572
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,834
I look forward to it.

573
00:48:34,734 --> 00:48:35,567
At ease!

574
00:48:36,333 --> 00:48:40,166
Captain and Rookie
are having a heartfelt conversation

575
00:48:40,233 --> 00:48:42,567
after the strategy meeting.

576
00:48:42,633 --> 00:48:43,700
Say hello.

577
00:48:43,767 --> 00:48:46,300
They are showing us
what true partnership is about.

578
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:47,734
Cross.

579
00:48:48,533 --> 00:48:51,533
-Whom are you talking to?
-I'm vlogging.

580
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:52,433
Hi.

581
00:48:52,767 --> 00:48:53,767
V... What?

582
00:48:53,834 --> 00:48:55,700
It's a video blog.

583
00:48:55,767 --> 00:48:57,800
I film what I eat, how I work,
and how I play,

584
00:48:57,867 --> 00:48:59,367
and upload the video.

585
00:48:59,433 --> 00:49:02,100
You can make a lot of money
when you have enough subscribers.

586
00:49:02,166 --> 00:49:03,033
You punk.

587
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:05,133
Are you exposing our strategy for money?

588
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,300
Of course not.
I edit out classified information.

589
00:49:07,367 --> 00:49:08,934
Besides, I only have one subscriber.

590
00:49:10,266 --> 00:49:11,467
My mom.

591
00:49:12,734 --> 00:49:14,100
-Right.
-Right.

592
00:49:14,166 --> 00:49:15,867
I don't care about money.

593
00:49:15,934 --> 00:49:18,000
I'm doing it
to see if women would be interested.

594
00:49:18,533 --> 00:49:19,467
Well...

595
00:49:20,567 --> 00:49:21,700
I want a girlfriend, too.

596
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:24,000
-Right.
-Right.

597
00:49:28,834 --> 00:49:29,667
By the way...

598
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:31,633
What?

599
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:33,767
If you don't know about vlogs,
you must not know this too.

600
00:49:33,834 --> 00:49:34,767
Don't know what?

601
00:49:35,233 --> 00:49:36,066
The Avocado case.

602
00:49:36,667 --> 00:49:37,500
Avocado?

603
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:40,400
Her username is Avocado.

604
00:49:40,934 --> 00:49:44,000
She's a woman who used to film herself
clubbing in Hongdae.

605
00:49:44,066 --> 00:49:47,633
But the last video she uploaded
is rather mysterious.

606
00:49:48,066 --> 00:49:48,900
I'll show you.

607
00:49:48,967 --> 00:49:51,066
AVOCADO'S VLOG

608
00:49:54,934 --> 00:49:56,767
AVOCADO TV

609
00:49:56,834 --> 00:49:57,867
She is Avocado.

610
00:49:57,934 --> 00:49:59,700
She stayed at the club until it closed

611
00:50:00,033 --> 00:50:01,433
and got on the first subway.

612
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:03,266
<i>Excuse me.</i>

613
00:50:06,834 --> 00:50:08,400
<i>I look like a fool.</i>

614
00:50:10,367 --> 00:50:12,700
<i>I'm dying here.</i>

615
00:50:13,266 --> 00:50:14,767
<i>-By the way,</i>
-Here it comes.

616
00:50:14,834 --> 00:50:17,033
<i>something annoying happened today.</i>

617
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:32,066
What was that?

618
00:50:32,133 --> 00:50:33,600
This was two weeks ago.

619
00:50:33,834 --> 00:50:36,867
She's been nowhere to be found
since she uploaded this video.

620
00:50:36,934 --> 00:50:38,934
-She's gone missing?
-Yes.

621
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,166
Some say that one of her fans
kidnapped her,

622
00:50:42,233 --> 00:50:45,100
and some say that she's putting on
a show to get more subscribers.

623
00:50:45,166 --> 00:50:48,066
They'll investigate once they decide
which station will take charge.

624
00:50:48,133 --> 00:50:49,133
Let's watch that again.

625
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:50,533
Snap out of it.

626
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:52,834
They will investigate.

627
00:50:55,834 --> 00:50:57,066
Let's go to Hongdae.

628
00:51:01,967 --> 00:51:05,700
The number one rule of going undercover is
to blend in like a shadow.

629
00:51:08,633 --> 00:51:09,867
Let's get ready and go.

630
00:52:17,367 --> 00:52:18,233
Captain Gong.

631
00:52:19,266 --> 00:52:21,667
Look at you all dressed up
when this is my jurisdiction.

632
00:52:23,633 --> 00:52:25,300
Today is a Club Day.

633
00:52:25,367 --> 00:52:27,367
It's our field day.

634
00:52:29,166 --> 00:52:32,133
Okay. I'll let you be here
since it's a big day.

635
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:35,467
You're rocking the rocker outfit.

636
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:39,834
Hey!

637
00:52:41,967 --> 00:52:43,700
You look like you've got the skills.

638
00:52:43,767 --> 00:52:44,800
What?

639
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,467
Does that mean we don't have the looks?

640
00:52:50,934 --> 00:52:53,333
You're the girl from that day, right?

641
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,533
Yes, I am. How have you been?

642
00:52:56,033 --> 00:52:58,166
We're working
in the same jurisdiction today,

643
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:00,533
so don't cross the line.

644
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:01,700
Yes, sir.

645
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:04,333
Good luck.

646
00:53:04,834 --> 00:53:06,900
-Good luck.
-Good luck.

647
00:53:06,967 --> 00:53:08,934
-That wig suits you.
-Good luck.

648
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,100
Avocado took the first train
at Hongik University Station

649
00:53:12,166 --> 00:53:13,200
and disappeared.

650
00:53:13,467 --> 00:53:15,633
That First Train Horror Story is real.

651
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:18,700
My friend's friend took
the first train after clubbing all night

652
00:53:18,767 --> 00:53:20,100
-and is unreachable now.
-Avocado?

653
00:53:20,166 --> 00:53:23,233
She's not at home
and absolutely nowhere to be found.

654
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:25,533
Also, the hardcore partier
that'd always be at S Club.

655
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:26,433
What about her?

656
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:28,500
She took the first train home
after a Club Day,

657
00:53:28,567 --> 00:53:30,100
-but she's nowhere to be seen now.
-What?

658
00:53:30,166 --> 00:53:31,800
-Isn't it scary?
-Yes, let's go.

659
00:53:34,967 --> 00:53:36,533
There's a horror story about it now.

660
00:53:41,266 --> 00:53:42,100
Snap out of it.

661
00:53:42,834 --> 00:53:44,033
It's the end of the quarter.

662
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:46,233
If we hear them out,

663
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:48,567
we might learn about more missing women.

664
00:53:49,934 --> 00:53:51,800
Snap out of it. We're here to get arrests.

665
00:53:53,467 --> 00:53:54,667
Oh, right.

666
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:57,066
I'm sorry.

667
00:53:57,467 --> 00:53:58,567
Let's go.

668
00:53:58,633 --> 00:54:00,500
I'm going to get all those perverts.

669
00:54:03,967 --> 00:54:04,967
That was close.

670
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,033
You've heard
about the Avocado case, right?

671
00:54:08,734 --> 00:54:09,567
Yes.

672
00:54:09,633 --> 00:54:12,500
I looked into it because I heard
it's become an urban myth.

673
00:54:14,133 --> 00:54:17,700
And the urban myth in question
is quite disturbing.

674
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:21,100
I watched it, too.
She disappeared from her home.

675
00:54:21,166 --> 00:54:23,266
It has nothing to do
with the Subway Ghost.

676
00:54:24,166 --> 00:54:25,700
How can you be so sure?

677
00:54:26,467 --> 00:54:27,300
What?

678
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:30,400
Come on.

679
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:34,033
You must come to a conclusion
by investigating.

680
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:36,700
Why would a detective
go after an urban myth?

681
00:54:37,767 --> 00:54:38,734
Chief Ha.

682
00:54:39,333 --> 00:54:40,967
The RIU will take this case!

683
00:54:41,433 --> 00:54:44,734
Find out if this really isn't related
to the Subway Ghost.

684
00:54:45,133 --> 00:54:46,066
Yes, ma'am.

685
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:50,100
Let's go our separate ways here.

686
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:52,066
You two take the exits.

687
00:54:52,133 --> 00:54:53,166
Yes, sir.

688
00:54:53,233 --> 00:54:54,467
Let's go, Father.

689
00:54:54,533 --> 00:54:56,934
Stop calling me that.
I'm not that much older.

690
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:57,967
Oh, come on.

691
00:54:58,033 --> 00:54:59,633
HONGIK UNIVERSITY STATION

692
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:02,233
Let's get started.

693
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:04,700
Keep your eyes only on me.

694
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:08,433
Yes, sir.

695
00:55:38,033 --> 00:55:41,000
The dinosaur's eyes don't look innocent.

696
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:44,000
-Go and check!
-Yes, sir.

697
00:55:46,033 --> 00:55:47,967
I'm Detective Yoo Ryeong
of the Subway Police.

698
00:55:48,033 --> 00:55:49,700
Please cooperate.

699
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:53,967
This is a gift for my kid.

700
00:55:57,533 --> 00:55:59,967
You're under arrest for illegal filming.

701
00:56:01,333 --> 00:56:02,166
Congratulations.

702
00:56:02,233 --> 00:56:05,300
You joined the team three weeks ago,
and this is your first arrest.

703
00:56:05,367 --> 00:56:06,934
But Captain.

704
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,533
Your eyesight...

705
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:12,834
It's not my eyesight. It's my creativity.

706
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:15,600
The expansion of thought
that any object could be used

707
00:56:15,667 --> 00:56:16,867
for spy cameras.

708
00:56:17,567 --> 00:56:18,533
Creativity.

709
00:56:20,467 --> 00:56:23,333
You can't see anything
if you try to look for cameras.

710
00:56:23,934 --> 00:56:26,867
Keep all possibilities open.

711
00:56:27,567 --> 00:56:29,066
This guy earlier... Give it to me.

712
00:56:29,133 --> 00:56:29,967
He was smiling...

713
00:56:32,333 --> 00:56:33,734
and walking like this, right?

714
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,867
He had to get the target in the shot,

715
00:56:35,934 --> 00:56:38,300
and that's why he was walking funny.

716
00:56:38,367 --> 00:56:40,133
When you think something is off,

717
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:41,200
you take a closer look.

718
00:56:41,266 --> 00:56:42,800
The tape was torn off once already,

719
00:56:42,867 --> 00:56:45,633
and the eyes of the T-Rex
are strangely shiny.

720
00:56:49,867 --> 00:56:50,767
Captain.

721
00:56:51,567 --> 00:56:52,533
I respect you.

722
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,600
-Creativity.
-Creativity.

723
00:56:57,033 --> 00:56:58,233
-Stay still.
-Detective Lee.

724
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:01,300
We caught a man
with a spy camera by Exit Eight.

725
00:57:01,367 --> 00:57:03,767
Please take him.

726
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,133
-Go!
-I'm going.

727
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:15,934
Are you all right?

728
00:57:29,667 --> 00:57:30,934
Get him!

729
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:32,934
You bastard!

730
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:55,633
Get up.

731
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:04,000
She stole him from us.

732
00:58:04,767 --> 00:58:06,600
What is up with you two?

733
00:58:06,667 --> 00:58:08,633
You won't give us time to catch bad guys.

734
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:12,066
Detective Lee, take them
to Wangsuri and write a report.

735
00:58:12,133 --> 00:58:14,400
We'll stay here until the last train.

736
00:58:14,467 --> 00:58:15,900
Okay. Keep up the good work.

737
00:58:15,967 --> 00:58:17,400
-Keep it up.
-That was awesome.

738
00:58:19,266 --> 00:58:20,300
Come this way.

739
00:58:20,367 --> 00:58:21,467
Let's get going now.

740
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:25,333
At this rate, we'll be number one.

741
00:58:26,367 --> 00:58:29,166
Then your penalty will...

742
00:58:29,233 --> 00:58:30,467
Let's get going again.

743
00:58:30,533 --> 00:58:31,900
How dare you!

744
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,500
I told you not to cross the line.

745
00:58:37,266 --> 00:58:41,467
We were undercover near the exits.
Why did you arrest the pervert there?

746
00:58:41,533 --> 00:58:43,934
I chased after him from the plaza.

747
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:44,834
I don't care!

748
00:58:46,567 --> 00:58:47,934
This is my jurisdiction.

749
00:58:48,533 --> 00:58:50,300
I'll tell you where you'll go undercover.

750
00:58:51,166 --> 00:58:52,133
You take

751
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:54,400
Exit Seven.

752
00:58:54,467 --> 00:58:57,400
Captain Gong!

753
00:59:02,133 --> 00:59:09,133
{\an8}HONGIK UNIVERSITY STATION

754
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:13,433
{\an8}Is this really Hongdae?

755
00:59:13,934 --> 00:59:16,400
It's over if we don't do well today.

756
00:59:16,934 --> 00:59:18,367
Shall we just go to Gangnam?

757
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,867
No. Even if we go now,
we will miss the peak hour.

758
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:34,133
Ko Ji-seok?

759
00:59:35,767 --> 00:59:36,633
Oh, Ma-ri.

760
00:59:37,066 --> 00:59:37,900
What are you up to?

761
00:59:40,133 --> 00:59:42,567
Right. We're working undercover.

762
00:59:43,333 --> 00:59:45,033
It's a Club Day.

763
00:59:45,233 --> 00:59:46,433
I see.

764
00:59:46,934 --> 00:59:47,800
You look nice.

765
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:49,834
What?

766
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:51,133
What are you doing here?

767
00:59:51,867 --> 00:59:54,333
A woman named Avocado disappeared.

768
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,633
Yes, I've heard about her.
The RIU's in charge?

769
00:59:56,700 --> 01:00:01,033
The story has turned into an urban myth
so the commissioner got worried.

770
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:01,967
By the way...

771
01:00:02,033 --> 01:00:04,934
She told us to see if it is
related to the Subway Ghost.

772
01:00:06,734 --> 01:00:08,834
Ms. Yoo, can I have a word with you?

773
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:12,400
What is it? Talk to her here.

774
01:00:12,467 --> 01:00:13,333
It won't take long.

775
01:00:14,066 --> 01:00:15,433
We're working undercover.

776
01:00:16,233 --> 01:00:17,467
I'll be right back.

777
01:00:29,166 --> 01:00:30,200
What is it?

778
01:00:30,266 --> 01:00:32,734
Are you really going into the tunnels?

779
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:34,533
Why do you ask?

780
01:00:35,066 --> 01:00:36,500
I don't want you to.

781
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:40,567
When you asked me to join the RIU,

782
01:00:41,867 --> 01:00:43,333
what did you mean by that?

783
01:00:44,233 --> 01:00:46,700
You ignored me two years ago.

784
01:00:48,367 --> 01:00:50,233
But now you believe what I said?

785
01:00:52,934 --> 01:00:57,433
I personally think it's impossible
to move the bodies through the tunnels.

786
01:00:58,033 --> 01:00:59,533
Your sister went missing

787
01:01:01,033 --> 01:01:01,934
the same way, but...

788
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,133
But her body wasn't found?

789
01:01:04,667 --> 01:01:05,700
So why do you ask?

790
01:01:07,934 --> 01:01:09,633
You won't believe me anyway.

791
01:01:10,133 --> 01:01:12,433
So why are you asking me to join the RIU?

792
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:14,200
Because you're not going to stop.

793
01:01:16,533 --> 01:01:17,533
Take her away.

794
01:01:38,934 --> 01:01:40,500
<i>If you're not going to stop anyway,</i>

795
01:01:41,333 --> 01:01:42,967
let's go after him together.

796
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:45,467
If we do,

797
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:48,300
you will be freed from this too.

798
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:51,333
I...

799
01:01:56,633 --> 01:01:58,934
I need a detective
who will find my sister...

800
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:03,066
not someone who pities me.

801
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,834
<i>He fought against Kim Won-tae.</i>

802
01:02:14,367 --> 01:02:19,000
<i>Apparently, he lost it
after Kim Won-tae beat up his partner.</i>

803
01:02:27,333 --> 01:02:28,834
You came all this way in disguise.

804
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:31,200
I hope you catch a big pervert.

805
01:02:32,533 --> 01:02:33,367
Goodbye.

806
01:02:36,867 --> 01:02:38,000
Bye, Mr. Ko.

807
01:02:38,333 --> 01:02:39,633
Goodbye, Ms. Yoo.

808
01:02:48,333 --> 01:02:50,300
Why does the chief of the RIU

809
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:52,567
always belittle you like that?

810
01:02:52,633 --> 01:02:54,400
You said you were classmates in college.

811
01:02:55,066 --> 01:02:57,767
You should've joined
the Regional Investigation Unit too.

812
01:02:57,834 --> 01:03:00,633
You graduated from the police university
with the highest grade.

813
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:03,533
So if you had gone there,
you would've been her boss.

814
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:04,433
Well...

815
01:03:05,333 --> 01:03:07,200
The higher the rank,
the bigger the burden.

816
01:03:07,967 --> 01:03:09,633
I like it in the Subway Police.

817
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:11,500
And why do you like it?

818
01:03:12,166 --> 01:03:15,467
You can get stabbed
in the Regional Investigation Unit.

819
01:03:15,533 --> 01:03:18,266
You could be beaten by gangs
working on the Violent Crimes Team.

820
01:03:18,333 --> 01:03:20,734
You could get involved
in many cases in a patrol station.

821
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,800
But in the Subway Police,

822
01:03:24,867 --> 01:03:27,500
the worst culprit you meet
is a pickpocket with nail clippers.

823
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:31,700
Although things are more complicated
with the Locust Swarm.

824
01:03:32,233 --> 01:03:35,033
That's why you joined the Subway Police?

825
01:03:35,567 --> 01:03:37,433
Because nail clippers
are the worst you deal with?

826
01:03:38,834 --> 01:03:40,367
Is it wrong for a police officer

827
01:03:40,433 --> 01:03:42,567
to want a stable lifestyle?

828
01:03:48,233 --> 01:03:49,133
Let's go home.

829
01:03:50,266 --> 01:03:51,467
Just like that?

830
01:03:51,533 --> 01:03:53,033
It's past the rush hour.

831
01:03:54,567 --> 01:03:55,867
Even if we stay longer...

832
01:03:57,667 --> 01:03:58,500
Okay.

833
01:04:19,166 --> 01:04:20,800
It's your first time at a club, right?

834
01:04:23,133 --> 01:04:24,800
You seem out of place, too.

835
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:31,033
Are you jealous?

836
01:04:33,266 --> 01:04:35,066
No, not at all.

837
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:38,900
I just...

838
01:04:39,734 --> 01:04:41,900
I just wonder what makes them so hyped.

839
01:04:43,233 --> 01:04:44,967
Why is it so hard

840
01:04:46,633 --> 01:04:49,233
for us to cross this street?

841
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:52,967
I don't even want to cross the street.

842
01:04:57,600 --> 01:04:58,467
Let's cross it.

843
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:01,800
Let's go have fun.

844
01:05:05,133 --> 01:05:06,934
-No, thanks.
-I'm serious.

845
01:05:08,867 --> 01:05:09,700
Come on.

846
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:11,767
Let's go.

847
01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:21,266
What's this?

848
01:05:21,633 --> 01:05:22,734
I don't know.

849
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:25,700
Let's go, Captain. This is...

850
01:05:25,767 --> 01:05:27,567
Why? We've already crossed the street.

851
01:05:27,633 --> 01:05:28,467
No.

852
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:41,033
Put it on.

853
01:05:45,166 --> 01:05:47,667
I thought you weren't afraid
of anything in the world.

854
01:05:47,734 --> 01:05:49,467
Why are you frozen up?

855
01:05:49,533 --> 01:05:50,734
I'm not.

856
01:05:56,133 --> 01:05:58,767
What's that move? You look like a chicken.

857
01:06:00,266 --> 01:06:01,800
That's why I said I wouldn't do it.

858
01:06:01,867 --> 01:06:02,700
Seriously.

859
01:06:12,266 --> 01:06:14,767
Come on, Captain.

860
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:17,467
I'm a horrible dancer, too.

861
01:06:17,533 --> 01:06:19,867
It'll be fun
because we're both horrible dancers.

862
01:06:19,934 --> 01:06:20,767
Come with me.

863
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,400
CATCH THE GHOST

864
01:08:14,333 --> 01:08:15,433
<i>Captain.</i>

865
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:16,800
<i>Don't go.</i>

866
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:18,266
You like him.

867
01:08:18,333 --> 01:08:19,500
<i>I want to change partners.</i>

868
01:08:19,834 --> 01:08:20,734
You want to get me replaced?

869
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:24,000
<i>You once said I was like your seatbelt.</i>

870
01:08:24,066 --> 01:08:25,767
How can you change your mind so easily?

871
01:08:26,133 --> 01:08:28,433
<i>There is a pickpocket
with a knife on that train.</i>

872
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:30,266
<i>I can catch a pickpocket myself.</i>

873
01:08:30,333 --> 01:08:32,200
<i>He's not just an ordinary pickpocket.</i>

874
01:08:32,266 --> 01:08:34,033
<i>There's something strange about him.</i>

875
01:08:35,367 --> 01:08:36,333
Who are you?
