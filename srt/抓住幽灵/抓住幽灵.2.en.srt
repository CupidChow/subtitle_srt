1
00:00:45,772 --> 00:00:48,211
_The only path the Subway Ghost can
take to transport dead bodies...

2
00:00:48,211 --> 00:00:50,156
without being seen...

3
00:00:50,711 --> 00:00:51,786
is the tunnel.

4
00:00:55,052 --> 00:00:56,256
Subway Ghost.

5
00:00:57,221 --> 00:00:58,697
I'll put an end to you personally.

6
00:01:43,962 --> 00:01:45,537
Where's my wallet?

7
00:01:55,672 --> 00:01:57,356
It fell out in that short time.

8
00:02:03,822 --> 00:02:05,096
The Grasshoppers.

9
00:02:06,551 --> 00:02:07,696
That's what they do.

10
00:02:09,621 --> 00:02:11,936
Sir. Please turn the car around.

11
00:02:30,241 --> 00:02:32,716
Newbie! Get out here!

12
00:02:35,111 --> 00:02:36,256
Newbie!

13
00:02:59,002 --> 00:03:00,216
Newbie!

14
00:03:03,442 --> 00:03:04,557
Newbie!

15
00:03:34,241 --> 00:03:36,186
(Wangsoori)

16
00:04:45,142 --> 00:04:46,357
Newbie!

17
00:04:51,181 --> 00:04:52,326
Are you okay?

18
00:04:54,922 --> 00:04:57,922
We need to catch him.
It was the Subway Ghost.

19
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:59,037
What?

20
00:05:08,931 --> 00:05:10,347
Stop right there!

21
00:05:13,241 --> 00:05:14,446
Freeze!

22
00:05:48,342 --> 00:05:50,157
(Kim Hyung Ja)

23
00:06:02,051 --> 00:06:03,537
Did you lose him?

24
00:06:05,392 --> 00:06:08,706
Based on what evidence do you
say he's the Subway Ghost?

25
00:06:09,532 --> 00:06:10,776
Well...

26
00:06:14,402 --> 00:06:16,477
The Subway Ghost moves the dead bodies...

27
00:06:17,142 --> 00:06:18,646
through the subway tunnels.

28
00:06:19,042 --> 00:06:20,217
Who said that?

29
00:06:21,111 --> 00:06:23,741
The SLA members.

30
00:06:23,741 --> 00:06:26,657
You and your stupid SLA.
You're a cop! You need evidence!

31
00:06:28,611 --> 00:06:30,026
He dropped this.

32
00:06:35,352 --> 00:06:37,537
He isn't the Subway Ghost,

33
00:06:38,261 --> 00:06:40,037
but a Grasshopper.

34
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:57,657
Chief.

35
00:07:28,371 --> 00:07:30,857
The wallets were there
before we got on the subway,

36
00:07:30,941 --> 00:07:33,427
but they were gone once we were in the car.

37
00:07:34,381 --> 00:07:38,227
That means they fell into the gap
between the train and the platform.

38
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:42,352
It was Podori.
The Podoris were Grasshoppers.

39
00:07:42,352 --> 00:07:46,196
Podori? Of all the...
I thought they came from the county office.

40
00:07:49,061 --> 00:07:53,847
So, the Grasshoppers came
back to collect the wallets,

41
00:07:54,001 --> 00:07:55,677
and Newbie kicked them out?

42
00:07:56,672 --> 00:07:58,876
We're in big trouble.

43
00:07:59,042 --> 00:08:02,516
I know you're a clueless rookie,
but don't you know anything?

44
00:08:02,542 --> 00:08:05,441
Now that we know how they did it,
all we had to do was catch them.

45
00:08:05,441 --> 00:08:06,441
But you ruined it.

46
00:08:06,441 --> 00:08:08,227
Why were you in the tunnel?

47
00:08:10,121 --> 00:08:13,227
I was patrolling and heard something.

48
00:08:13,652 --> 00:08:15,526
Still, how could you open the screen doors?

49
00:08:15,951 --> 00:08:19,436
I could get fired for that.
Do you understand?

50
00:08:19,761 --> 00:08:20,761
Yes, sir.

51
00:08:20,761 --> 00:08:22,861
Long time ago, a detective...

52
00:08:22,861 --> 00:08:25,977
went into the tunnel to catch a
vandal who was drawing graffiti.

53
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:28,407
But he forgot to close the screen doors,

54
00:08:28,772 --> 00:08:30,776
and someone was hit by a train and died.

55
00:08:31,371 --> 00:08:34,087
The tunnel is off-limits.

56
00:08:34,172 --> 00:08:36,447
The chief inspector was fired
for not training him properly,

57
00:08:36,512 --> 00:08:38,441
and so was the detective.

58
00:08:38,441 --> 00:08:39,756
I'm sorry, sir.

59
00:08:42,451 --> 00:08:44,756
If you act without permission
just one more time,

60
00:08:45,252 --> 00:08:47,327
you'll be transferred to a local precinct.

61
00:08:52,061 --> 00:08:54,207
Don't go into the tunnel.

62
00:08:58,331 --> 00:09:00,747
(Screen Door)

63
00:09:03,601 --> 00:09:07,987
(Knowing you have family who
will return if you wait...)

64
00:09:28,632 --> 00:09:30,136
There she is.

65
00:09:30,561 --> 00:09:32,707
- Thank you.
- Sure.

66
00:09:37,701 --> 00:09:40,516
He's so handsome.

67
00:09:58,122 --> 00:09:59,467
Excuse me.

68
00:10:00,461 --> 00:10:02,166
How old are you?

69
00:10:03,191 --> 00:10:05,437
Why do you ask?

70
00:10:05,632 --> 00:10:08,406
You're just so pretty.

71
00:10:10,341 --> 00:10:13,317
I'm turning 17 this year.

72
00:10:13,841 --> 00:10:16,886
What a great age.

73
00:10:19,142 --> 00:10:20,687
What about you, mister?

74
00:10:21,351 --> 00:10:22,827
I'm 33.

75
00:10:24,721 --> 00:10:26,867
You're totally old.

76
00:10:30,662 --> 00:10:31,896
Right?

77
00:10:32,922 --> 00:10:34,437
I'm all grown up now,

78
00:10:36,461 --> 00:10:37,707
Mom.

79
00:10:41,632 --> 00:10:43,006
Are you waiting for someone?

80
00:10:43,742 --> 00:10:45,376
My boyfriend.

81
00:10:47,742 --> 00:10:49,717
He must be busy.

82
00:11:07,532 --> 00:11:08,791
Would you please tell Ms. Han Ae Shim...

83
00:11:08,792 --> 00:11:11,561
that her boyfriend will be here tonight?

84
00:11:11,561 --> 00:11:12,837
Okay.

85
00:11:13,402 --> 00:11:14,646
Thank you.

86
00:11:20,872 --> 00:11:23,242
(Wangsoori Station)

87
00:11:23,242 --> 00:11:27,081
The rolled omelets are free.
Take one with you.

88
00:11:27,081 --> 00:11:28,227
Ma'am.

89
00:11:28,652 --> 00:11:32,081
Check it out.
The rolled omelets are really good.

90
00:11:32,081 --> 00:11:34,551
The spicy tripe is to die for.

91
00:11:34,551 --> 00:11:36,252
Excuse me, ma'am.

92
00:11:36,252 --> 00:11:39,662
We're conducting official government
business. Please go somewhere else.

93
00:11:39,662 --> 00:11:42,766
Miss, I'm doing this to survive.

94
00:11:43,731 --> 00:11:46,676
The police...

95
00:11:47,032 --> 00:11:49,471
are harassing a citizen...

96
00:11:49,471 --> 00:11:51,841
- Okay.
- Woe to me.

97
00:11:51,841 --> 00:11:54,046
- Okay, ma'am.
- This is so unfair.

98
00:11:54,711 --> 00:11:56,171
We won't...

99
00:11:56,172 --> 00:11:58,882
Please take one.

100
00:11:58,882 --> 00:12:02,327
I told you. You cause trouble,
you'll go to a local precinct.

101
00:12:09,152 --> 00:12:10,491
Should we look for people...

102
00:12:10,492 --> 00:12:12,737
looking at their phones to
catch people who sneak pics?

103
00:12:15,032 --> 00:12:18,006
Newbies are pretty much community service.

104
00:12:18,262 --> 00:12:22,607
It takes at least three months to catch on.

105
00:12:24,701 --> 00:12:26,876
Although I don't know if
you'll last that long...

106
00:12:51,402 --> 00:12:52,536
No way.

107
00:12:53,061 --> 00:12:54,406
I can see it now.

108
00:13:13,522 --> 00:13:14,926
Gosh, I'm sorry.

109
00:13:16,122 --> 00:13:17,561
- Thank you.
- Are you all right, sir?

110
00:13:17,561 --> 00:13:18,967
Yes. Thank you.

111
00:13:19,191 --> 00:13:22,437
Which floor did you say the lockers are at?

112
00:13:22,831 --> 00:13:24,502
Yes, yes. I'll be quick.

113
00:13:24,502 --> 00:13:27,132
Yes, yes. Please wait just a moment.

114
00:13:27,132 --> 00:13:28,607
I'll be right up.

115
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:45,896
Yes, I'm here now.

116
00:13:46,181 --> 00:13:48,526
Locker number six, right?

117
00:13:50,022 --> 00:13:51,296
What's the password?

118
00:13:51,762 --> 00:13:53,237
4325.

119
00:13:54,191 --> 00:13:55,337
4325.

120
00:13:57,601 --> 00:13:58,776
Take out what's inside,

121
00:13:59,762 --> 00:14:01,947
and send it to the number I tell you.

122
00:14:05,542 --> 00:14:06,872
Do I just call this number...

123
00:14:06,872 --> 00:14:09,146
and ask which address I
should make the delivery to?

124
00:14:09,272 --> 00:14:11,617
Yes. Please make sure
you deliver without fail.

125
00:14:16,382 --> 00:14:18,857
Those who didn't pay up
after taking my goods...

126
00:14:19,622 --> 00:14:21,166
all ended up paying me in the end.

127
00:14:25,792 --> 00:14:28,067
Don't worry.
You'll be able to pay me back too.

128
00:14:29,532 --> 00:14:32,406
It doesn't necessarily have
to be in the form of money.

129
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:36,546
(Locker Fees)

130
00:14:53,892 --> 00:14:55,067
Freeze.

131
00:14:56,691 --> 00:14:58,636
You're under arrest while
in the act of a crime.

132
00:14:59,922 --> 00:15:01,107
What is this?

133
00:15:01,892 --> 00:15:03,532
You shouldn't have committed a crime.

134
00:15:03,532 --> 00:15:05,376
- Hey.
- I'm sorry, Chief Inspector Gong.

135
00:15:05,931 --> 00:15:07,447
"Chief Inspector"?

136
00:15:12,002 --> 00:15:13,711
- He's coming.
- What's going on?

137
00:15:13,711 --> 00:15:17,046
You're under arrest for sexual molestation.

138
00:15:21,851 --> 00:15:23,882
Hey, why did you let
someone untrained loose...

139
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:25,522
during our peak time?

140
00:15:25,522 --> 00:15:27,727
I'm sorry, Chief. I'm sorry.

141
00:15:29,652 --> 00:15:31,997
This is Chief Inspector Gong of
Dangsan Station Subway Police.

142
00:15:33,461 --> 00:15:34,607
I'm sorry.

143
00:15:35,231 --> 00:15:36,992
But why are you wearing climbing gear...

144
00:15:36,992 --> 00:15:38,306
and holding a hiking stick?

145
00:15:38,331 --> 00:15:40,306
Wearing a disguise is the
basic of being on a stakeout.

146
00:15:40,601 --> 00:15:43,146
Forget it. Where are we right now?

147
00:15:43,571 --> 00:15:44,772
Dangsan Station.

148
00:15:44,772 --> 00:15:46,847
Stay in your own territory, okay?

149
00:15:47,412 --> 00:15:48,672
Don't you know it's against
Subway Police ethics...

150
00:15:48,672 --> 00:15:50,070
to invade someone else's territory?

151
00:15:50,071 --> 00:15:52,516
- I'm sorry.
- That's all you know how to say.

152
00:15:52,912 --> 00:15:55,327
- Let's go. There's the evidence.
- Wait.

153
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:06,591
An officer should just be
able to catch a pervert.

154
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:07,806
Why is he bringing up ethics?

155
00:16:10,902 --> 00:16:13,207
- I'll do my best!
- This is your problem.

156
00:16:13,532 --> 00:16:15,947
Please don't do your best.

157
00:16:16,772 --> 00:16:17,916
Okay.

158
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:25,481
Chief.

159
00:16:25,481 --> 00:16:26,841
You know we have to report...

160
00:16:26,841 --> 00:16:28,386
the Grasshopper case to
the Commissioner, right?

161
00:16:28,481 --> 00:16:30,697
Right, I almost forgot. Thank you.

162
00:16:36,191 --> 00:16:37,666
Thank goodness we have this at least.

163
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,837
Keep this safe.

164
00:16:42,362 --> 00:16:43,437
Yes, sir.

165
00:16:48,402 --> 00:16:50,276
Hello, there.

166
00:16:50,971 --> 00:16:52,201
Can I help you?

167
00:16:52,201 --> 00:16:55,416
I lost my cell phone.

168
00:16:55,672 --> 00:16:57,987
I need it to make my deliveries.

169
00:16:59,441 --> 00:17:01,382
You're the delivery man from earlier.

170
00:17:01,382 --> 00:17:04,127
Gosh, are you a detective?

171
00:17:04,721 --> 00:17:06,556
Yes. Please come and have a seat.

172
00:17:06,652 --> 00:17:07,822
- Okay.
- Take a seat.

173
00:17:07,822 --> 00:17:09,627
Thank you. Thank you.

174
00:17:10,451 --> 00:17:11,596
Okay.

175
00:17:12,622 --> 00:17:14,066
Gosh, thank you.

176
00:17:14,362 --> 00:17:16,931
I'll call the station office
and the lost and found.

177
00:17:16,931 --> 00:17:17,931
Please wait a moment.

178
00:17:17,931 --> 00:17:21,776
While I wait,
would it be okay to eat my food?

179
00:17:21,971 --> 00:17:23,247
Of course.

180
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,316
Gosh, thank you.

181
00:17:32,281 --> 00:17:34,756
You should eat slowly.
You could get an upset stomach.

182
00:17:36,152 --> 00:17:37,657
Okay. Thank you.

183
00:17:38,882 --> 00:17:40,127
That looks a bit dry.

184
00:17:41,221 --> 00:17:42,596
You should have this too.

185
00:17:43,552 --> 00:17:45,897
Gosh. Thank you.

186
00:17:46,362 --> 00:17:47,566
The thing is,

187
00:17:48,491 --> 00:17:50,006
I have to run around all day...

188
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:52,707
to earn maybe 10 dollars or so.

189
00:17:53,102 --> 00:17:54,306
These days,

190
00:17:55,332 --> 00:17:58,377
even rice soups cost 6 or 7 dollars.

191
00:17:59,441 --> 00:18:02,516
You won't be able to make deliveries
until you find your phone.

192
00:18:02,812 --> 00:18:03,987
Well,

193
00:18:05,511 --> 00:18:10,256
I just have to go to Shinsegae
and Lotte department stores.

194
00:18:10,882 --> 00:18:12,457
There's just one delivery
that's tying me down.

195
00:18:12,951 --> 00:18:17,637
Gosh. I shouldn't have saved
that number on my phone.

196
00:18:18,392 --> 00:18:19,596
Gosh.

197
00:18:19,922 --> 00:18:22,467
You're giving me instant noodles.
Thank you so much.

198
00:18:25,961 --> 00:18:27,276
Thank you.

199
00:18:29,072 --> 00:18:32,046
My goodness. I must be going crazy.

200
00:18:32,642 --> 00:18:34,447
This is no time to eat.

201
00:18:34,511 --> 00:18:36,541
- What is it?
- My customers are waiting.

202
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:38,157
I have to hurry up and make deliveries.

203
00:18:38,241 --> 00:18:39,612
I'm so sorry.

204
00:18:39,612 --> 00:18:41,812
I'll quickly deliver these...

205
00:18:41,812 --> 00:18:43,582
then come back here later.

206
00:18:43,582 --> 00:18:45,852
- My apologies.
- No problem.

207
00:18:45,852 --> 00:18:48,497
- I'm late. Thank you so much.
- No problem.

208
00:18:50,892 --> 00:18:52,937
We should get going too.
Go grab the Commissioner's wallet.

209
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:55,667
Yes, sir.

210
00:19:08,741 --> 00:19:09,887
No, no.

211
00:19:10,412 --> 00:19:12,356
You haven't returned this yet?
What's with all this?

212
00:19:13,112 --> 00:19:14,987
You broke the moped.

213
00:19:15,382 --> 00:19:17,026
I closed my installment savings
to buy a new one for the owner...

214
00:19:17,181 --> 00:19:19,481
and got this one fixed to use as our ride.

215
00:19:19,481 --> 00:19:22,397
"Installment savings"?
Are you sure you bought them a new one?

216
00:19:25,991 --> 00:19:28,137
Isn't it illegal remodeling
to attach a siren?

217
00:19:36,172 --> 00:19:37,247
(Police)

218
00:19:37,572 --> 00:19:38,717
Get on.

219
00:19:47,281 --> 00:19:48,387
We're off.

220
00:19:53,052 --> 00:19:55,191
We're analyzing the security footage
from the spots they went missing...

221
00:19:55,191 --> 00:19:58,021
to see if anyone looks
suspicious around the victims.

222
00:19:58,021 --> 00:19:59,422
We're also figuring out
all possible routes...

223
00:19:59,422 --> 00:20:00,761
that lead to the outside.

224
00:20:00,761 --> 00:20:03,806
Don't focus on the case,
and focus on the victims.

225
00:20:03,862 --> 00:20:06,737
We're researching any hatred
relationships as well.

226
00:20:07,531 --> 00:20:09,447
What I mean is,

227
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:13,147
don't try to solve the case with your head.

228
00:20:13,602 --> 00:20:16,987
Use your heart. Okay?

229
00:20:23,582 --> 00:20:25,526
We found a clue.

230
00:20:26,822 --> 00:20:27,897
Come in.

231
00:20:34,392 --> 00:20:36,237
- What is it?
- Please take a look.

232
00:20:41,672 --> 00:20:43,606
Chief Inspector Ko, I think you overdid it.

233
00:20:44,172 --> 00:20:47,516
No, ma'am. I don't mind going
to such lengths for you.

234
00:20:49,441 --> 00:20:52,741
"Hot flashes, migraine, insomnia,"

235
00:20:52,741 --> 00:20:55,756
"tinnitus, sudden heart rate increase..."

236
00:20:56,711 --> 00:20:59,281
"For menopause in your
50s, take Rejuvenamin".

237
00:20:59,281 --> 00:21:00,991
What? What is that?

238
00:21:00,991 --> 00:21:02,697
What are you trying to pull?

239
00:21:03,021 --> 00:21:04,397
Are you crazy?

240
00:21:04,491 --> 00:21:05,991
You insulted me in front of the nation...

241
00:21:05,991 --> 00:21:08,407
on our 30th-anniversary event.

242
00:21:08,931 --> 00:21:11,536
What is this for?
Are you doing this on purpose?

243
00:21:13,701 --> 00:21:15,707
I think the bags were switched.

244
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:19,977
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

245
00:21:20,741 --> 00:21:21,917
I'll switch them back.

246
00:21:30,441 --> 00:21:32,116
(Public Order is Science and Strategy)

247
00:21:45,711 --> 00:21:47,117
That woman...

248
00:21:48,711 --> 00:21:49,857
(Seoun Metropolitan Police Agency)

249
00:21:52,376 --> 00:21:55,507
What did she say? Is she happy?

250
00:21:55,507 --> 00:21:57,552
She was so happy...

251
00:21:57,576 --> 00:21:59,116
that I regret being there alone.

252
00:21:59,116 --> 00:22:00,177
What is it?

253
00:22:00,177 --> 00:22:02,661
I've got such bad luck with my partner.

254
00:22:03,616 --> 00:22:05,191
Is the moped's engine on?

255
00:22:05,287 --> 00:22:08,102
- I was going to...
- Why didn't you turn it on?

256
00:22:12,997 --> 00:22:15,241
What happened?

257
00:22:15,697 --> 00:22:16,872
Woo Hyuk.

258
00:22:17,396 --> 00:22:18,772
What are you staring at?

259
00:22:19,396 --> 00:22:20,711
What is it?

260
00:22:23,007 --> 00:22:24,411
That woman...

261
00:22:25,237 --> 00:22:27,082
I think she joined the Subway Police.

262
00:22:27,707 --> 00:22:29,447
Subway Police? Why?

263
00:22:29,447 --> 00:22:32,092
Last time, she mentioned that the
Subway Ghost is in the tunnel.

264
00:22:32,116 --> 00:22:33,951
She said the answer is in the tunnel.

265
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:36,661
You think that's why she
joined the Subway Police?

266
00:22:37,146 --> 00:22:38,762
No way.

267
00:22:41,056 --> 00:22:43,701
But why is she following Ji Seok?

268
00:22:46,197 --> 00:22:48,227
How did they get switched?

269
00:22:48,227 --> 00:22:49,901
My gosh.

270
00:22:50,997 --> 00:22:54,681
It makes more sense for him to
go to Lotte before Shinsegae.

271
00:22:54,806 --> 00:22:56,312
Let's go to Yeongdeungpo-gu.

272
00:22:56,767 --> 00:22:57,881
Okay.

273
00:23:13,687 --> 00:23:15,262
Gosh. Gosh.

274
00:23:15,987 --> 00:23:17,062
My goodness!

275
00:23:19,257 --> 00:23:21,471
- Did you say this is mine? This?
- Gosh.

276
00:23:22,297 --> 00:23:24,911
How are you so fearless at your age?

277
00:23:25,267 --> 00:23:26,797
Where did you hide my goods?

278
00:23:26,797 --> 00:23:29,741
- Well?
- No, I didn't hide anything.

279
00:23:31,237 --> 00:23:34,007
I'm an old man who earns
his living day by day.

280
00:23:34,007 --> 00:23:36,346
This delivery job is my lifeline.

281
00:23:36,346 --> 00:23:37,916
Why would I do such a thing?

282
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,191
Be quiet and just tell me
where my goods are.

283
00:23:54,527 --> 00:23:56,572
Gosh...

284
00:23:58,096 --> 00:23:59,211
(Exit)

285
00:24:01,866 --> 00:24:03,812
He should be coming this way.

286
00:24:06,906 --> 00:24:09,622
- Why is it locked?
- This is crazy.

287
00:24:10,177 --> 00:24:11,592
Wait right here.

288
00:24:18,517 --> 00:24:19,762
(Seoun Metro)

289
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:26,131
Is there anyone inside?

290
00:24:32,767 --> 00:24:35,711
While I wait,
would it be okay to eat my food?

291
00:24:38,507 --> 00:24:39,752
It's him.

292
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:45,721
Move out of the way.

293
00:24:46,217 --> 00:24:48,092
No, that would be an act of vandalism.

294
00:25:01,527 --> 00:25:05,372
Sir! Sir! What are we going to do?

295
00:25:06,396 --> 00:25:07,612
Sir.

296
00:25:08,806 --> 00:25:10,012
Sir.

297
00:25:10,906 --> 00:25:13,707
Sir, can you hear me?

298
00:25:13,707 --> 00:25:15,881
- Sir. Gosh...
- What do we do?

299
00:25:15,977 --> 00:25:18,451
- Try to open your eyes.
- Is this 911?

300
00:25:19,277 --> 00:25:21,346
There's a first aid kit on
the third basement floor.

301
00:25:21,346 --> 00:25:22,517
Please bring some bandages.

302
00:25:22,517 --> 00:25:24,221
The third basement floor? Okay?

303
00:25:24,386 --> 00:25:26,592
Shoot. Stop right there!

304
00:25:27,886 --> 00:25:29,062
Hey!

305
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:47,881
How did this happen?

306
00:25:49,406 --> 00:25:50,951
I'm sorry.

307
00:25:51,977 --> 00:25:53,177
Are you all right, sir?

308
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:56,891
Yes. Thank you. Which floor
did you say the lockers are at?

309
00:25:58,156 --> 00:25:59,691
The subway lockers.

310
00:26:14,636 --> 00:26:16,181
These contain narcotics.

311
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:17,436
"Narcotics"?

312
00:26:17,437 --> 00:26:19,105
Drug dealers store drugs in subway lockers,

313
00:26:19,106 --> 00:26:20,951
then pass the goods using deliverymen.

314
00:26:21,547 --> 00:26:23,605
It's a typical tactic they use...

315
00:26:23,606 --> 00:26:25,252
to avoid getting tracked by the police.

316
00:26:25,846 --> 00:26:27,352
Those jerks.

317
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,792
Let's go catch him.

318
00:26:32,056 --> 00:26:35,401
Is this the Narcotics Unit?
This is Ko Ji Seok, Subway Police.

319
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:38,332
I'd like to report a narcotics case.
Are you...

320
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:41,326
An officer should try to solve
cases, not report them.

321
00:26:41,326 --> 00:26:42,997
This isn't a simple assault case.

322
00:26:42,997 --> 00:26:44,396
That's why we need to catch him fast.

323
00:26:44,396 --> 00:26:46,767
Because it's not simple
and his crime is malicious.

324
00:26:46,767 --> 00:26:49,106
Narcotics cases often involve gangs.

325
00:26:49,106 --> 00:26:51,537
We could cause problems by
getting involved recklessly.

326
00:26:51,537 --> 00:26:53,707
Until Narcotics catches the one in charge,

327
00:26:53,707 --> 00:26:55,707
they'll use the man who
assaulted the old man as bait.

328
00:26:55,707 --> 00:26:57,282
What if he runs away in the meantime?

329
00:26:57,576 --> 00:26:58,846
I told you not to do your best.

330
00:26:58,846 --> 00:27:01,187
Why do you keep on saying that?

331
00:27:01,187 --> 00:27:04,092
All you do is your best
but without thinking!

332
00:27:04,217 --> 00:27:06,386
A few days ago, you were dragged
along with your arm stuck in a car.

333
00:27:06,386 --> 00:27:08,701
And yesterday you were
lying down on the tracks.

334
00:27:09,356 --> 00:27:11,356
We can ignore the fact that
you're putting me in trouble,

335
00:27:11,356 --> 00:27:13,332
but don't you ever think
about your family at home?

336
00:27:13,356 --> 00:27:16,201
Do they not care if you get
hurt or get in trouble at work?

337
00:27:29,707 --> 00:27:32,217
(Sorry for the shabby lunch, Dad.)

338
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:34,391
(I'll make your favorite for
dinner and wait for you.)

339
00:27:37,586 --> 00:27:39,131
That old man...

340
00:27:40,987 --> 00:27:42,901
is someone's family too.

341
00:27:46,856 --> 00:27:50,042
Have you ever thought
of the family members...

342
00:27:50,697 --> 00:27:52,542
who are being neglected by the police?

343
00:27:57,166 --> 00:27:58,706
If my dad...

344
00:27:58,707 --> 00:28:01,507
carries bags around all day on the subway...

345
00:28:01,507 --> 00:28:03,381
to make 10 dollars a day,

346
00:28:03,876 --> 00:28:05,746
then gets hit on the head
because he was unlucky...

347
00:28:05,747 --> 00:28:07,076
and got involved with a drug dealer,

348
00:28:07,076 --> 00:28:08,862
where can I go to complain?

349
00:28:10,086 --> 00:28:13,391
Most people have nowhere else to rely on...

350
00:28:13,487 --> 00:28:15,461
when such things happen except the police.

351
00:28:15,987 --> 00:28:18,302
But if the police look away,

352
00:28:19,257 --> 00:28:20,631
those people...

353
00:28:21,967 --> 00:28:24,002
will be tormented all their lives.

354
00:28:34,707 --> 00:28:35,947
(Sorry for the shabby lunch, Dad.)

355
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:37,075
(I'll make your favorite for
dinner and wait for you.)

356
00:28:37,076 --> 00:28:38,451
They're waiting for him?

357
00:28:46,757 --> 00:28:49,562
Hello, this is Han Ae Shim's son.

358
00:28:50,487 --> 00:28:51,602
Yes.

359
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:53,356
Could you tell her...

360
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:57,102
that her boyfriend can't make it today?

361
00:29:04,237 --> 00:29:05,352
(Exit)

362
00:29:09,507 --> 00:29:10,651
Let's go.

363
00:29:12,777 --> 00:29:13,891
I'm sorry?

364
00:29:14,987 --> 00:29:16,421
I said, let's go...

365
00:29:16,687 --> 00:29:17,961
to do our best.

366
00:29:24,386 --> 00:29:26,395
Why are we dealing with a major crime...

367
00:29:26,396 --> 00:29:27,901
instead of catching the Grasshoppers?

368
00:29:28,697 --> 00:29:30,971
Drugs mean gangs.

369
00:29:32,797 --> 00:29:34,297
Please consider it an assault case...

370
00:29:34,297 --> 00:29:36,306
instead of a drug case.

371
00:29:36,306 --> 00:29:37,336
But...

372
00:29:37,336 --> 00:29:39,206
This is the security footage
from Yeongdeungpo Station.

373
00:29:39,207 --> 00:29:40,451
Can you look for the suspect?

374
00:29:43,346 --> 00:29:45,947
Soo Ho, call the service
provider to get the call records.

375
00:29:45,947 --> 00:29:47,376
- Okay.
- Let's get going.

376
00:29:47,376 --> 00:29:48,721
- Okay.
- Okay.

377
00:29:49,886 --> 00:29:51,355
What should I do?

378
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:52,855
Take a seat.

379
00:29:52,856 --> 00:29:54,292
Okay.

380
00:29:55,487 --> 00:29:56,661
Stay still.

381
00:29:58,096 --> 00:29:59,126
(Yeongdeungpo Station)

382
00:29:59,126 --> 00:30:00,297
There he is.

383
00:30:00,297 --> 00:30:02,272
Yes, please check right away.

384
00:30:02,497 --> 00:30:04,126
Can you zoom in?

385
00:30:04,126 --> 00:30:07,366
Okay. Gosh, I thought he
was wearing a turtleneck.

386
00:30:07,366 --> 00:30:09,782
Okay. Just a second, Chief.

387
00:30:10,806 --> 00:30:11,905
What is this?

388
00:30:11,906 --> 00:30:13,805
He didn't take the subway,

389
00:30:13,806 --> 00:30:15,352
so we don't have any records
of his transportation card.

390
00:30:15,646 --> 00:30:18,391
He used a burner phone to call the old man.

391
00:30:18,947 --> 00:30:20,792
We can't get his fingerprints
because he wore gloves.

392
00:30:21,076 --> 00:30:24,322
He's a professional.
It'll be hard to catch him right away.

393
00:30:26,856 --> 00:30:28,201
What about his tattoos?

394
00:30:28,356 --> 00:30:31,131
Why don't we visit tattoo
parlors with this picture?

395
00:30:31,797 --> 00:30:33,431
You're right.

396
00:30:33,596 --> 00:30:34,772
Why didn't I think of that?

397
00:30:35,197 --> 00:30:37,542
We'll be able to catch him in a year.

398
00:30:38,596 --> 00:30:41,641
I wish your head would
run as fast as you act.

399
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:48,007
Let's look at all the footage
near the locker the drugs were in.

400
00:30:48,007 --> 00:30:49,981
- Okay.
- I'll get on it.

401
00:30:53,846 --> 00:30:54,921
(Station Office)

402
00:31:02,856 --> 00:31:04,971
Isn't it too fast to catch anything?

403
00:31:05,297 --> 00:31:09,072
I look at security
footage more than my wife.

404
00:31:09,227 --> 00:31:10,971
I can catch it even if
it's sped up eight times.

405
00:31:14,767 --> 00:31:15,881
I found it.

406
00:31:31,217 --> 00:31:32,391
A mustache?

407
00:31:32,517 --> 00:31:33,792
It's someone else.

408
00:31:33,987 --> 00:31:35,787
These lockers are past the turnstiles,

409
00:31:35,787 --> 00:31:37,302
so he must have used
his transportation card.

410
00:31:40,126 --> 00:31:41,941
Let's catch this punk first.

411
00:31:42,666 --> 00:31:44,502
Check his transportation
card to find out who he is.

412
00:31:44,866 --> 00:31:46,697
Get the transaction history
of his credit card...

413
00:31:46,697 --> 00:31:48,481
- to see what he did where.
- Yes, sir.

414
00:32:19,767 --> 00:32:21,272
It's your first time at a club, right?

415
00:32:25,106 --> 00:32:26,451
You stand out like a sore thumb too.

416
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:33,752
Why haven't you been to one yet?

417
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:36,092
What about you?

418
00:32:36,447 --> 00:32:37,562
I didn't because...

419
00:32:40,156 --> 00:32:41,461
it's not my scene.

420
00:32:42,856 --> 00:32:44,362
I was busy too.

421
00:32:44,757 --> 00:32:46,131
Hi sweetie.

422
00:32:47,527 --> 00:32:49,302
Nice to meet you.

423
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:51,572
Who are you?

424
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:53,812
You're so cute.

425
00:32:54,336 --> 00:32:56,082
Sweetie, let's go play.

426
00:32:56,166 --> 00:32:57,582
- Where?
- Let's go!

427
00:32:58,136 --> 00:32:59,282
Where?

428
00:33:19,626 --> 00:33:23,772
You see, I'm on a stakeout.

429
00:33:24,666 --> 00:33:26,611
I'm sorry. I'm a cop.

430
00:33:33,476 --> 00:33:35,181
Let's put this on.

431
00:33:36,007 --> 00:33:39,491
Come on, play with me.

432
00:33:42,016 --> 00:33:44,931
- Give me that.
- What are you doing?

433
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:53,931
What's this?

434
00:33:55,797 --> 00:33:57,641
Give me that. Please.

435
00:33:57,927 --> 00:33:59,712
Give it to me slowly.

436
00:33:59,896 --> 00:34:02,841
Okay, slowly now. Okay.

437
00:34:08,307 --> 00:34:10,352
Hey, you! Why you...

438
00:34:10,646 --> 00:34:11,891
Give me that. Scram.

439
00:34:13,876 --> 00:34:15,022
Chief.

440
00:34:15,547 --> 00:34:17,347
That must hurt so much. Oh no.

441
00:34:17,347 --> 00:34:18,462
It doesn't hurt.

442
00:34:31,666 --> 00:34:33,611
It looks like Mustache.

443
00:34:34,266 --> 00:34:36,382
Hurry. Hurry. It's Mustache.

444
00:34:38,737 --> 00:34:40,611
We'll just confirm it's
him and call for backup.

445
00:34:47,976 --> 00:34:49,122
Are you mad?

446
00:34:51,447 --> 00:34:52,531
No.

447
00:34:54,956 --> 00:34:56,301
Pull your foot out. Now.

448
00:34:57,257 --> 00:34:59,531
Let go.

449
00:34:59,896 --> 00:35:01,272
What's going on out there?

450
00:35:02,226 --> 00:35:03,801
Sweeties.

451
00:35:05,637 --> 00:35:07,071
Hi there.

452
00:35:12,976 --> 00:35:14,982
- Who are you?
- Nice to meet you.

453
00:35:16,746 --> 00:35:17,852
She's cute.

454
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:19,622
Sit here, babe.

455
00:35:20,577 --> 00:35:21,861
I don't want to.

456
00:35:22,686 --> 00:35:23,792
Sweetie.

457
00:35:24,217 --> 00:35:26,591
Sweetie. Sweetie patootie.

458
00:35:27,387 --> 00:35:28,801
Play with me.

459
00:35:30,286 --> 00:35:32,801
I don't want you either. Go over there.

460
00:35:36,166 --> 00:35:37,301
Sweeties.

461
00:35:38,396 --> 00:35:41,011
I heard you have something good.

462
00:36:10,766 --> 00:36:12,071
(Rejuvenamin)

463
00:36:15,266 --> 00:36:16,411
Take your pick.

464
00:36:17,106 --> 00:36:19,482
I came to the right room.

465
00:36:20,876 --> 00:36:22,082
How about my sweetie's?

466
00:36:23,007 --> 00:36:25,617
That's pretty strong. Are you sure?

467
00:36:25,617 --> 00:36:26,692
Let me try.

468
00:36:33,686 --> 00:36:35,661
You're so cool.

469
00:36:37,286 --> 00:36:38,801
You crazy little...

470
00:36:39,797 --> 00:36:40,902
Hey.

471
00:36:41,356 --> 00:36:43,341
What's your problem?

472
00:36:59,347 --> 00:37:01,077
- Go.
- What?

473
00:37:01,077 --> 00:37:02,692
Hurry.

474
00:37:04,086 --> 00:37:05,232
What's going on?

475
00:37:05,657 --> 00:37:08,761
Take this and run to Cheongdam
Station, exit number nine.

476
00:37:09,827 --> 00:37:11,557
- What are they?
- They're...

477
00:37:11,557 --> 00:37:12,772
Get her!

478
00:37:13,197 --> 00:37:15,066
- Just run. Please.
- What are these?

479
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,372
Where are you going?

480
00:37:18,936 --> 00:37:20,071
Get over here.

481
00:37:21,336 --> 00:37:22,511
Get him!

482
00:37:25,907 --> 00:37:27,212
Get him!

483
00:37:27,737 --> 00:37:28,852
Get back here!

484
00:37:31,577 --> 00:37:32,652
Get him!

485
00:37:33,277 --> 00:37:34,391
Hey, you!

486
00:37:35,547 --> 00:37:37,022
Cheongdam Station, exit number nine.

487
00:37:38,617 --> 00:37:39,861
Go downstairs and make a right.

488
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:42,132
Go through the turnstile, down the stairs,

489
00:37:42,257 --> 00:37:43,761
and make a right at the end of the walkway.

490
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:46,602
Just get there safely.

491
00:37:46,927 --> 00:37:48,031
Hey, you!

492
00:37:52,836 --> 00:37:54,166
What are you up to?

493
00:37:54,166 --> 00:37:55,967
- Go down and make a right.
- What?

494
00:37:55,967 --> 00:37:56,967
Get him!

495
00:37:56,967 --> 00:37:58,777
Take two flights down past the turnstile,

496
00:37:58,777 --> 00:37:59,976
and make a right at the end of the walkway.

497
00:37:59,976 --> 00:38:01,582
- What?
- Wait for me there.

498
00:38:01,807 --> 00:38:02,907
Stop him!

499
00:38:02,907 --> 00:38:04,122
(Cheongdam)

500
00:38:07,347 --> 00:38:09,122
Hey! Stop!

501
00:38:09,746 --> 00:38:10,991
Get him.

502
00:38:12,157 --> 00:38:13,861
Right. Stairs. Left.

503
00:38:14,217 --> 00:38:15,226
Right.

504
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:16,902
Why you...

505
00:38:18,427 --> 00:38:20,071
- Sorry!
- Hey, you!

506
00:38:43,987 --> 00:38:45,091
Stop!

507
00:39:00,197 --> 00:39:02,341
(This walkway is closed
due to construction.)

508
00:39:04,367 --> 00:39:05,451
Darn it.

509
00:39:10,807 --> 00:39:11,922
Got him.

510
00:39:12,316 --> 00:39:14,617
Just kill him.

511
00:39:14,617 --> 00:39:17,321
Hey, you. Did you run like mad
so you wouldn't get beat up...

512
00:39:17,617 --> 00:39:18,931
in front of people?

513
00:39:19,356 --> 00:39:21,062
Newbie, you little...

514
00:39:24,186 --> 00:39:26,632
Listen! I'm a cop.

515
00:39:27,257 --> 00:39:28,602
If you assault an officer,

516
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:31,995
it's obstruction of justice.
as well. Got that?

517
00:39:31,996 --> 00:39:33,641
What is that punk saying?

518
00:39:33,867 --> 00:39:35,641
Hey. Give me that.

519
00:39:37,066 --> 00:39:38,181
Hand it over.

520
00:39:41,036 --> 00:39:42,522
7 to 1.

521
00:39:55,887 --> 00:39:57,962
What the...

522
00:40:17,646 --> 00:40:19,091
Stop glaring.

523
00:40:23,016 --> 00:40:24,192
Seriously.

524
00:40:25,286 --> 00:40:28,062
Hey. Where's your freak of a girlfriend?

525
00:40:28,757 --> 00:40:29,861
Hold on.

526
00:40:39,666 --> 00:40:41,272
Where is she?

527
00:40:42,336 --> 00:40:44,082
Over here!

528
00:40:46,976 --> 00:40:48,111
Newbie!

529
00:40:53,949 --> 00:40:55,695
Where is she?

530
00:40:56,435 --> 00:40:58,950
Over here!

531
00:41:01,287 --> 00:41:02,463
Newbie!

532
00:41:03,988 --> 00:41:05,103
Hey.

533
00:41:07,127 --> 00:41:08,333
Wait!

534
00:42:08,218 --> 00:42:09,333
Hey.

535
00:42:10,017 --> 00:42:11,233
Yes, ma'am?

536
00:42:11,417 --> 00:42:12,632
Hey!

537
00:42:13,758 --> 00:42:15,273
Move it!

538
00:42:15,428 --> 00:42:16,572
Punks.

539
00:42:16,997 --> 00:42:18,057
Shape up.

540
00:42:18,057 --> 00:42:19,472
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

541
00:42:20,968 --> 00:42:22,197
Hey.

542
00:42:22,198 --> 00:42:24,968
What's the name of the guy with
the tattoo on the back of his neck?

543
00:42:24,968 --> 00:42:29,182
- Darn it.
- Over here!

544
00:42:40,287 --> 00:42:42,762
Do you want to take another shower?

545
00:42:43,187 --> 00:42:44,693
Do you want to take another shower?

546
00:42:45,888 --> 00:42:47,488
Want me to spray you so you can cool down?

547
00:42:47,488 --> 00:42:49,127
So your mouth will open automatically?

548
00:42:49,127 --> 00:42:51,333
I'm lacking sleep. That's what it is.

549
00:42:54,298 --> 00:42:57,237
- Spill it.
- I don't know him.

550
00:42:57,238 --> 00:42:58,868
Why not? You're in the same gang.

551
00:42:58,868 --> 00:43:00,682
I'm not in a gang.

552
00:43:01,877 --> 00:43:03,508
Why you little...

553
00:43:03,508 --> 00:43:05,552
Interrogations are about mind games, Newbie.

554
00:43:07,707 --> 00:43:08,853
Ma'am.

555
00:43:11,247 --> 00:43:13,623
You... You can't do this.

556
00:43:15,287 --> 00:43:18,293
Hey. If you're not with a gang, who are you?

557
00:43:18,488 --> 00:43:20,857
He said to put it in the locker,

558
00:43:20,857 --> 00:43:22,758
and he'd pay me 50 bucks. It was a side job.

559
00:43:22,758 --> 00:43:25,972
- A side job.
- A side job.

560
00:43:26,227 --> 00:43:29,072
What are you doing?

561
00:43:29,397 --> 00:43:31,713
Call him and tell him you want to meet.

562
00:43:31,767 --> 00:43:32,912
Wait.

563
00:43:33,167 --> 00:43:34,282
Give me that.

564
00:43:34,568 --> 00:43:36,552
- You can't call him.
- Why not?

565
00:43:38,307 --> 00:43:41,253
Tattoo was the one to call him every time.

566
00:43:41,307 --> 00:43:44,552
If he suddenly calls,
it'll be like a warning to run.

567
00:43:47,147 --> 00:43:50,132
You're the transporter. What's his role?

568
00:43:57,497 --> 00:43:59,273
Are you awake?

569
00:44:05,807 --> 00:44:07,043
Gramps.

570
00:44:07,307 --> 00:44:11,412
You can't take what belongs to
me and lie comfortably in bed.

571
00:44:16,618 --> 00:44:17,923
He abducted someone?

572
00:44:18,718 --> 00:44:22,262
A nurse saw the guy with the
tattoo take him in a wheelchair.

573
00:44:22,787 --> 00:44:24,132
For what?

574
00:44:25,328 --> 00:44:26,632
Thank you.

575
00:44:37,497 --> 00:44:38,983
Listen carefully.

576
00:44:39,238 --> 00:44:41,182
This is about your life.

577
00:44:41,807 --> 00:44:45,052
You'll lose five years
for transporting drugs.

578
00:44:45,078 --> 00:44:47,348
It's my first offense.
They won't give me time.

579
00:44:47,348 --> 00:44:49,318
Dealing drugs.

580
00:44:49,318 --> 00:44:50,992
You took some too,

581
00:44:53,848 --> 00:44:55,793
so there goes another five years.

582
00:44:56,857 --> 00:45:00,328
If you forced drugs onto someone
else, tack on another five years.

583
00:45:00,328 --> 00:45:02,598
The intent of forcing drugs on
someone was probably quasi-rape.

584
00:45:02,598 --> 00:45:04,403
That adds up to 20 years... No.

585
00:45:04,598 --> 00:45:06,868
There were several of you,
so it's aggravated rape.

586
00:45:06,868 --> 00:45:08,227
(30 years)

587
00:45:08,227 --> 00:45:11,643
Hey. How old will you be 30 years from now?

588
00:45:11,968 --> 00:45:13,607
Look, so...

589
00:45:13,607 --> 00:45:15,778
We have security footage of you
putting the drugs in the locker...

590
00:45:15,778 --> 00:45:17,607
and a witness of the crimes at the club.

591
00:45:17,607 --> 00:45:19,578
There are tons of cameras
in front of the club,

592
00:45:19,578 --> 00:45:21,382
so it'll be a piece of
cake to find the victims!

593
00:45:24,778 --> 00:45:26,262
Our nation...

594
00:45:26,787 --> 00:45:29,793
doesn't officially allow plea bargains.

595
00:45:30,587 --> 00:45:32,988
Pardon? Plea... What?

596
00:45:32,988 --> 00:45:34,733
Cutting a deal.

597
00:45:35,397 --> 00:45:38,227
However, it is permitted in drug cases...

598
00:45:38,227 --> 00:45:41,143
in order to catch those
higher up the food chain.

599
00:45:44,138 --> 00:45:46,043
Tell us what your system is.

600
00:45:46,307 --> 00:45:48,242
Tell us the role of the guy with the tattoo.

601
00:45:50,807 --> 00:45:53,423
Then you can get out before you're all grey.

602
00:45:59,417 --> 00:46:01,318
Call the Narcotics Unit and Major Crimes.

603
00:46:01,318 --> 00:46:04,287
- Yes, sir.
- Hold on. Hold on.

604
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:07,862
- Is this Major Crimes?
- Hold on, detective. Okay. Hold on.

605
00:46:11,298 --> 00:46:12,968
Every few weeks,

606
00:46:12,968 --> 00:46:17,043
a Chinese vendor brings
goods to Incheon Harbor.

607
00:46:17,397 --> 00:46:19,008
You made it. Hurry it up.

608
00:46:19,008 --> 00:46:21,943
Then I take it and wait.

609
00:46:22,678 --> 00:46:24,612
That guy takes all the orders.

610
00:46:25,008 --> 00:46:26,882
Once he takes the orders and gets the money,

611
00:46:27,008 --> 00:46:28,348
he contacts me.

612
00:46:28,348 --> 00:46:29,793
How does he get paid?

613
00:46:29,917 --> 00:46:32,193
I'm sure they don't wire him drug money.

614
00:46:32,287 --> 00:46:35,862
I heard they tape the money
under the blue vending machine.

615
00:46:37,118 --> 00:46:40,057
Then he'll go to the blue
vending machine for the money.

616
00:46:40,057 --> 00:46:41,333
Where is it?

617
00:46:41,488 --> 00:46:44,028
I... I don't know that part.

618
00:46:44,028 --> 00:46:47,698
I only overheard him talking
with someone through the phone.

619
00:46:47,698 --> 00:46:49,373
I mean it.

620
00:46:50,868 --> 00:46:54,313
We must find the blue vending
machine before the next drug deal.

621
00:46:54,408 --> 00:46:56,078
There are about 300 stations,

622
00:46:56,078 --> 00:46:59,282
so each of us has to search about 75.

623
00:46:59,908 --> 00:47:01,822
This is insane.

624
00:47:02,877 --> 00:47:05,218
He's an old man in his 70s,

625
00:47:05,218 --> 00:47:07,092
but he's in good shape.

626
00:47:07,488 --> 00:47:10,262
Come on, give me more.

627
00:47:10,888 --> 00:47:12,903
Fine. I'll bring him right over.

628
00:47:17,698 --> 00:47:21,972
Even some kids in their 20s die.
Don't be so upset.

629
00:47:23,337 --> 00:47:24,873
Let's get ready and go.

630
00:47:31,207 --> 00:47:32,382
It's him.

631
00:47:35,178 --> 00:47:36,592
Act natural.

632
00:47:42,048 --> 00:47:43,262
Hello?

633
00:47:44,957 --> 00:47:47,786
He'll be at the blue vending
machine within the hour.

634
00:47:47,787 --> 00:47:50,833
Even if we ask for backup
and get 30 people looking,

635
00:47:51,158 --> 00:47:53,403
it'll take time to find
that vending machine...

636
00:47:58,868 --> 00:48:01,813
Blue vending machines in the 330 stations...

637
00:48:05,408 --> 00:48:08,552
You know where the blue vending
machines are, don't you?

638
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:11,222
There are too many.

639
00:48:11,618 --> 00:48:13,722
We can't check them all in time.

640
00:48:14,388 --> 00:48:16,362
Just tell me where they are.
I'll take it from there.

641
00:48:18,287 --> 00:48:19,503
Quickly.

642
00:48:19,888 --> 00:48:21,003
Yes, sir.

643
00:48:22,957 --> 00:48:24,698
Gangbyeon, Gwanghwamun, Oryu-dong,

644
00:48:24,698 --> 00:48:26,298
Ewha, Jeungsan, Noryangjin,

645
00:48:26,298 --> 00:48:28,543
Samgakji, Sangbong, Dodang Mangu,

646
00:48:28,598 --> 00:48:30,238
Sosa, Eungam, Seoul Grand Park,

647
00:48:30,238 --> 00:48:33,242
Doksu, Hapjeong, Isu, Sinchon, Hoegi,

648
00:48:33,307 --> 00:48:35,313
Daebang, Boramae, Sang-dong,

649
00:48:36,037 --> 00:48:37,282
That's all.

650
00:48:37,877 --> 00:48:39,207
Is there a way?

651
00:48:39,207 --> 00:48:41,753
She knows this off the
top of her head? How...

652
00:48:46,087 --> 00:48:48,623
An old man who delivers packages
via subway was abducted.

653
00:48:48,857 --> 00:48:51,957
The abductor will appear by
a blue vending machine...

654
00:48:51,957 --> 00:48:54,162
at one of the stations marked above.

655
00:48:54,957 --> 00:48:57,673
I need help from the
Subway Police detectives.

656
00:48:57,798 --> 00:48:59,928
I'll go to Ewha Station.
I'm three stops away.

657
00:48:59,928 --> 00:49:03,173
I'm five stops from Jeungsan.
Heading over now.

658
00:49:03,698 --> 00:49:05,397
Ewha and Jeungsan are taken.

659
00:49:05,397 --> 00:49:07,483
Isu, Sinchon, Samgakji.

660
00:49:08,068 --> 00:49:09,213
We're good.

661
00:49:09,908 --> 00:49:11,777
Soo Ho, you go to Gangbyeon and Doksu.

662
00:49:11,778 --> 00:49:13,853
- Okay.
- Detective Lee, take Gwanghwamun.

663
00:49:14,348 --> 00:49:15,653
- Yes, sir.
- Let's get moving.

664
00:49:33,667 --> 00:49:36,112
Money found under blue vending
machine at Ewha Station.

665
00:49:36,337 --> 00:49:37,773
Found it.

666
00:49:39,937 --> 00:49:41,043
(Ewha Womans University)

667
00:49:55,787 --> 00:49:57,063
It's him.

668
00:49:59,587 --> 00:50:01,432
- Stay still.
- Stay still.

669
00:50:26,017 --> 00:50:28,222
Taxi!

670
00:50:40,897 --> 00:50:43,242
Sir, you can't lose him.

671
00:50:50,278 --> 00:50:51,353
Go faster.

672
00:50:59,988 --> 00:51:01,118
Where are you going?

673
00:51:01,118 --> 00:51:03,092
My arm!

674
00:51:05,318 --> 00:51:07,362
A little faster.

675
00:51:09,528 --> 00:51:10,632
Hey...

676
00:51:14,028 --> 00:51:15,867
You can't shoot this.

677
00:51:15,868 --> 00:51:17,213
You'll be disciplined even
if you hit him perfectly.

678
00:51:17,698 --> 00:51:19,537
Why are you giving it to me
if I can't even shoot it?

679
00:51:19,537 --> 00:51:21,943
To threaten the perp,
since it may get dangerous.

680
00:51:31,718 --> 00:51:32,862
Please let go.

681
00:51:33,888 --> 00:51:35,992
- You'll shoot, won't you?
- I will not.

682
00:51:36,357 --> 00:51:38,532
You'll kick me out if I get disciplined.

683
00:51:40,328 --> 00:51:42,357
The first is a blank. The rest are live.

684
00:51:42,357 --> 00:51:43,673
If you really can't hold back,

685
00:51:44,497 --> 00:51:45,702
shoot just once.

686
00:51:47,028 --> 00:51:48,103
Got that?

687
00:51:54,437 --> 00:51:57,753
Yes, Chief. The first bullet is a blank.

688
00:52:04,678 --> 00:52:05,893
Hey, Gramps.

689
00:52:06,917 --> 00:52:08,123
Wait long?

690
00:52:11,388 --> 00:52:12,532
Gramps.

691
00:52:13,357 --> 00:52:15,262
It's time to pay me back.

692
00:52:17,627 --> 00:52:20,472
Come on. Let's go.

693
00:52:20,767 --> 00:52:21,943
Have mercy.

694
00:52:22,698 --> 00:52:23,873
Let's go.

695
00:52:24,337 --> 00:52:26,512
Why is an old man so strong?

696
00:52:27,468 --> 00:52:29,083
After you pay for your crimes!

697
00:52:37,678 --> 00:52:38,822
Hands up.

698
00:52:42,488 --> 00:52:45,233
Stop right there! Move, and I'll shoot.

699
00:52:48,888 --> 00:52:51,233
Hey. Shoot.

700
00:52:52,298 --> 00:52:53,543
Does that even fire real bullets?

701
00:52:54,497 --> 00:52:57,572
Korean cops' guns are all just accessories.

702
00:52:59,807 --> 00:53:02,653
Just leave him. I won't chase you then.

703
00:53:03,037 --> 00:53:04,412
Please, leave him!

704
00:53:29,738 --> 00:53:30,873
No!

705
00:53:48,287 --> 00:53:50,417
The first is a blank. The rest are live.

706
00:53:50,417 --> 00:53:51,632
If you really can't hold back,

707
00:53:52,258 --> 00:53:53,463
shoot just once.

708
00:53:54,287 --> 00:53:55,432
Got that?

709
00:54:04,238 --> 00:54:05,443
Darn it.

710
00:54:09,707 --> 00:54:11,083
The second bullet is live.

711
00:54:18,147 --> 00:54:20,693
Hey. Go ahead and shoot.

712
00:54:22,488 --> 00:54:23,693
Shoot!

713
00:54:28,227 --> 00:54:29,773
Just like a cop.

714
00:54:43,537 --> 00:54:44,853
I said not to shoot!

715
00:55:08,468 --> 00:55:09,773
I said not to shoot.

716
00:55:26,017 --> 00:55:27,123
Kimchi.

717
00:55:30,388 --> 00:55:32,963
It was kimchi. Kimchi.

718
00:55:33,057 --> 00:55:34,503
I didn't know.

719
00:55:35,658 --> 00:55:38,132
I thought you were dead!

720
00:55:40,598 --> 00:55:42,603
I really thought you were dead.

721
00:55:44,837 --> 00:55:46,443
I thought I was dead too.

722
00:55:48,638 --> 00:55:49,882
I'm not though.

723
00:55:52,848 --> 00:55:54,452
It smells.

724
00:55:55,408 --> 00:55:58,753
This is... Oh, this.

725
00:55:59,687 --> 00:56:01,348
You thought it was blood.

726
00:56:01,348 --> 00:56:03,632
I thought it was blood and...

727
00:56:04,187 --> 00:56:05,563
You must have been scared.

728
00:56:06,627 --> 00:56:07,802
I'm okay.

729
00:56:10,627 --> 00:56:11,873
Let go.

730
00:56:13,698 --> 00:56:15,727
- Let go!
- Go quietly.

731
00:56:15,727 --> 00:56:17,173
- Stay still.
- Stop whining.

732
00:56:17,537 --> 00:56:18,612
Get in.

733
00:56:20,037 --> 00:56:22,882
The vendor will bring more goods
into Incheon Harbor next week.

734
00:56:23,107 --> 00:56:25,307
Please catch them all,
including whoever's at the top.

735
00:56:25,307 --> 00:56:26,423
Thank you.

736
00:56:34,988 --> 00:56:37,592
Thank you for being alive.

737
00:56:38,457 --> 00:56:39,603
I'm the one...

738
00:56:40,388 --> 00:56:41,632
who's thankful.

739
00:56:44,758 --> 00:56:45,903
Dad.

740
00:56:47,928 --> 00:56:49,098
I told you to stay home.

741
00:56:49,098 --> 00:56:51,512
Why did you go out and
have this happen to you?

742
00:56:54,138 --> 00:56:56,408
Why did you come here? It's dangerous.

743
00:56:56,408 --> 00:56:59,983
How do you expect me to live if you die?

744
00:57:11,388 --> 00:57:13,532
Did you save my dad?

745
00:57:13,988 --> 00:57:15,333
Are you his daughter?

746
00:57:15,787 --> 00:57:18,373
I had no idea. I'm so sorry.

747
00:57:18,598 --> 00:57:20,598
Thank you.

748
00:57:20,598 --> 00:57:23,072
It wasn't me. It was our newbie.

749
00:57:23,598 --> 00:57:24,742
Pardon?

750
00:57:28,868 --> 00:57:30,036
(Sorry for the shabby lunch, Dad.)

751
00:57:30,037 --> 00:57:31,207
(I'll make your favorite for
dinner and wait for you.)

752
00:57:31,207 --> 00:57:34,282
Cook him his favorite dinner.

753
00:57:35,048 --> 00:57:36,123
I will.

754
00:57:37,818 --> 00:57:38,923
Thank you.

755
00:57:40,147 --> 00:57:41,463
Thank you so much.

756
00:57:43,287 --> 00:57:44,432
Thank you.

757
00:57:54,568 --> 00:57:56,512
Did you really cry?

758
00:57:58,098 --> 00:57:59,342
- No, I did not.
- Hello?

759
00:58:01,167 --> 00:58:03,882
I'll be right there. Okay.

760
00:58:04,877 --> 00:58:06,153
I need to go.

761
00:58:06,908 --> 00:58:09,722
- Is something wrong?
- I want to go see my family.

762
00:58:10,678 --> 00:58:11,952
Me too.

763
00:58:12,048 --> 00:58:14,348
I'm going to brag to my girls...

764
00:58:14,348 --> 00:58:15,722
that Daddy caught a villain.

765
00:58:16,258 --> 00:58:18,032
I'll go to my mom.

766
00:58:19,627 --> 00:58:23,302
Spend time with your family
today and get some rest.

767
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:25,202
Okay.

768
00:58:26,227 --> 00:58:27,643
- Let's go.
- Goodbye.

769
00:58:28,727 --> 00:58:30,873
How about a team dinner tomorrow?
Pork belly and soju.

770
00:58:31,238 --> 00:58:32,337
Yes!

771
00:58:32,337 --> 00:58:36,782
That sounds good.

772
00:58:45,218 --> 00:58:48,393
I told you, I don't want it!

773
00:58:48,618 --> 00:58:52,762
My boyfriend said he'd bring
me my favorite Samguri Chicken.

774
00:58:55,428 --> 00:58:58,873
Still, you can't starve
yourself for two days.

775
00:59:00,028 --> 00:59:01,503
When is he coming?

776
00:59:16,318 --> 00:59:17,793
Myung Chul.

777
00:59:20,247 --> 00:59:23,492
My sweet Ae Shim. Sorry I'm late.

778
00:59:25,357 --> 00:59:27,503
Come give me a hug.

779
00:59:29,158 --> 00:59:30,773
Sweetie.

780
00:59:33,328 --> 00:59:34,603
Ta-da.

781
00:59:35,428 --> 00:59:37,713
My favorite Samguri Chicken.

782
00:59:38,198 --> 00:59:40,083
Okay.

783
00:59:42,337 --> 00:59:43,512
Here.

784
00:59:51,118 --> 00:59:52,253
It's delicious.

785
01:00:04,428 --> 01:00:08,403
(Ko Ji Seok)

786
01:00:10,167 --> 01:00:11,713
Dad.

787
01:00:14,537 --> 01:00:16,578
How many husbands receive this much love...

788
01:00:16,578 --> 01:00:17,983
even after they die?

789
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:22,832
Especially as how you looked when
you were young in your prime.

790
01:00:25,367 --> 01:00:28,973
You are so blessed, Mr. Ko Myung Chul.

791
01:00:38,048 --> 01:00:40,252
Gosh.

792
01:00:42,478 --> 01:00:44,362
You're so pretty.

793
01:00:48,487 --> 01:00:50,263
Wait, give it to me.

794
01:00:53,197 --> 01:00:54,732
Open up.

795
01:01:28,927 --> 01:01:30,243
Goodness.

796
01:02:23,887 --> 01:02:25,062
Yoo Jin.

797
01:02:26,088 --> 01:02:27,763
Can you leave it alone?

798
01:02:34,197 --> 01:02:35,533
Stop it.

799
01:02:36,967 --> 01:02:39,073
Stop doing that.

800
01:02:39,097 --> 01:02:42,243
Give it back! Give it back!

801
01:02:43,407 --> 01:02:45,283
You're unbelievable.

802
01:02:51,677 --> 01:02:53,752
- Is it fun?
- Yes.

803
01:03:42,927 --> 01:03:44,268
Once the trains start running,

804
01:03:44,268 --> 01:03:46,913
it's impossible to load corpses
without having anyone notice.

805
01:03:47,037 --> 01:03:49,137
I'm sure he loaded the
corpse from the garage.

806
01:03:49,137 --> 01:03:51,567
But we could only find
footprints and cigarette butts...

807
01:03:51,568 --> 01:03:53,212
that belonged to employees.

808
01:03:58,847 --> 01:04:00,752
I think she joined the Subway Police.

809
01:04:01,318 --> 01:04:03,263
Subway Police? Why?

810
01:04:04,217 --> 01:04:07,093
Last time, she mentioned that the
Subway Ghost is in the tunnel.

811
01:04:07,588 --> 01:04:09,462
She said the answer is in the tunnel.

812
01:04:10,958 --> 01:04:12,732
You're thinking about Yoo Ryung, aren't you?

813
01:04:13,757 --> 01:04:15,458
"Did she really join the Subway Police..."

814
01:04:15,458 --> 01:04:17,042
"because of the tunnel?"

815
01:04:17,798 --> 01:04:20,042
"Is the answer really in the tunnel?"

816
01:04:20,637 --> 01:04:24,112
No. We searched the tunnel too.

817
01:04:31,907 --> 01:04:34,648
How can he load a body by
entering through the tunnel?

818
01:04:34,648 --> 01:04:36,562
It's not like he can board a running train.

819
01:04:39,188 --> 01:04:41,387
Had he taken the corpse into the tunnel,

820
01:04:41,387 --> 01:04:44,062
he'll end up exiting this way anyway.

821
01:04:48,028 --> 01:04:49,768
But no one was seen on security cameras.

822
01:04:49,768 --> 01:04:51,002
It's not the tunnel.

823
01:04:53,637 --> 01:04:54,873
Kim Woo Hyuk.

824
01:04:55,467 --> 01:04:57,107
Bring me all the documents...

825
01:04:57,108 --> 01:04:58,467
we collected in the last
two years for this case.

826
01:04:58,467 --> 01:05:00,053
Let's go through them again from the top.

827
01:05:00,108 --> 01:05:01,208
All of it?

828
01:05:01,208 --> 01:05:03,977
We have over 2,000 testimonies.

829
01:05:03,978 --> 01:05:06,223
Even if we have more than
10,000, I'll look at them again.

830
01:06:26,997 --> 01:06:28,632
(Catch the Ghost)

831
01:06:29,057 --> 01:06:30,228
Why are you acting like
we've never met before?

832
01:06:30,228 --> 01:06:31,768
Are you the one who
shattered the screen doors?

833
01:06:31,768 --> 01:06:33,368
I told you not to mind me.

834
01:06:33,368 --> 01:06:34,538
A disciplinary committee?

835
01:06:34,538 --> 01:06:37,137
You need to draw the line and
say it's Officer Yoo's fault.

836
01:06:37,137 --> 01:06:38,582
They went missing?

837
01:06:38,637 --> 01:06:40,778
People have such nerve after
borrowing someone else's money.

838
01:06:40,778 --> 01:06:43,948
Please don't hurt my son and wife.

839
01:06:43,948 --> 01:06:45,223
- Hey!
- What?

840
01:06:47,377 --> 01:06:48,922
I think he's the target.

841
01:06:52,188 --> 01:06:53,893
Why is he trying to kill?
