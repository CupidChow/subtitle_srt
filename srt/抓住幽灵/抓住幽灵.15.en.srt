(_All characters, organizations,
places, entities, and events...)

2
00:00:18,183 --> 00:00:19,659
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:27,303 --> 00:00:28,479
Ms. Choi Kyung Hee.

4
00:00:33,363 --> 00:00:35,038
We know you're inside.

5
00:00:35,164 --> 00:00:37,038
If you don't open up,
we'll force the door open.

6
00:00:38,234 --> 00:00:39,339
Ryung.

7
00:00:43,033 --> 00:00:44,218
Ms. Choi Kyung Hee.

8
00:00:46,274 --> 00:00:47,389
Ryung.

9
00:01:00,594 --> 00:01:02,029
Newbie, step back.

10
00:01:18,574 --> 00:01:20,249
(Episode 15)

11
00:01:24,283 --> 00:01:25,358
Chief.

12
00:01:35,693 --> 00:01:36,798
Ryung.

13
00:01:39,124 --> 00:01:41,639
Do you think she got the same ones
because she couldn't forget Sae Rom?

14
00:01:42,133 --> 00:01:43,869
Then they'd be children's shoes.

15
00:01:48,473 --> 00:01:49,608
Darn it.

16
00:01:52,544 --> 00:01:53,679
She fled.

17
00:01:55,814 --> 00:01:57,559
- Search the place.
- Yes, sir.

18
00:03:04,843 --> 00:03:06,459
It looks like she got far away already.

19
00:03:08,884 --> 00:03:09,989
But...

20
00:03:10,854 --> 00:03:12,029
It's strange, isn't it?

21
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:14,623
Kim Yi Joon was her only child.

22
00:03:14,623 --> 00:03:15,799
That's right.

23
00:03:16,993 --> 00:03:18,168
Whose room is this?

24
00:03:40,014 --> 00:03:43,288
The guy the police pegged
as the Subway Ghost...

25
00:03:43,954 --> 00:03:45,959
was the Subway Ghost's victim.

26
00:03:49,194 --> 00:03:51,098
How does the media look?

27
00:03:51,194 --> 00:03:53,668
They have reporters camping out at Metro,

28
00:03:53,924 --> 00:03:57,438
so word already spread that we
went to the mental hospital.

29
00:03:58,234 --> 00:04:00,004
They're calling dozens of times a day,

30
00:04:00,004 --> 00:04:01,933
asking what happened there.

31
00:04:01,933 --> 00:04:03,978
It's so hard avoiding
answer their question...

32
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:06,948
If that gets out,
the police will fall apart.

33
00:04:07,204 --> 00:04:08,918
That's what he's after.

34
00:04:09,574 --> 00:04:12,459
We'll tell them the
truth after we catch him.

35
00:04:13,143 --> 00:04:17,799
So you must stop it from
getting out until then. Okay?

36
00:04:18,183 --> 00:04:20,198
Yes, ma'am. Understood.

37
00:04:26,894 --> 00:04:28,133
We'll chase Choi Kyung Hee...

38
00:04:28,133 --> 00:04:30,294
once we get the lab results
of the items from her house.

39
00:04:30,294 --> 00:04:32,539
First, let's focus on Kim Yi Joon.

40
00:04:33,034 --> 00:04:34,433
He met with Kim Chul Jin,

41
00:04:34,433 --> 00:04:36,578
his target, at the mental hospital.

42
00:04:36,703 --> 00:04:39,604
I'm sure he killed him right there.

43
00:04:39,604 --> 00:04:42,044
He killed Kim Chul Jin at the
place the police gathered...

44
00:04:42,044 --> 00:04:43,448
to catch Kim Chul Jin.

45
00:04:44,443 --> 00:04:46,183
It's the best way to humiliate the police.

46
00:04:46,183 --> 00:04:48,253
He'll display the body after murdering him.

47
00:04:48,253 --> 00:04:50,229
Do you think he'll put it
under the subway bench again?

48
00:04:50,313 --> 00:04:51,398
No way.

49
00:04:51,784 --> 00:04:53,898
It's obvious the police
would focus on the subway.

50
00:04:54,654 --> 00:04:56,053
And we know what he looks like.

51
00:04:56,053 --> 00:04:59,068
No. He'll display it in the subway again.

52
00:04:59,464 --> 00:05:01,208
That way, his message will be complete.

53
00:05:02,433 --> 00:05:05,338
On face value,
it's the subway that killed Sae Rom.

54
00:05:06,363 --> 00:05:08,979
But when you look inside,
people were involved.

55
00:05:09,774 --> 00:05:13,148
The people who caused her death,
and those who didn't stop it.

56
00:05:13,674 --> 00:05:15,919
He put their bodies on the
subway and made it race along...

57
00:05:16,613 --> 00:05:18,059
to say this to the world.

58
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:21,188
"It wasn't the subway that killed my child."

59
00:05:22,284 --> 00:05:23,458
"It was these people."

60
00:05:28,693 --> 00:05:31,469
He'll show up on the first
train tomorrow morning.

61
00:05:32,263 --> 00:05:34,394
There's no way he can load the body...

62
00:05:34,394 --> 00:05:36,568
onto a train where people are already on it.

63
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:39,479
An empty first train.

64
00:05:40,534 --> 00:05:42,479
That's his only opportunity.

65
00:05:43,073 --> 00:05:45,373
People start boarding as soon
as the first train stops...

66
00:05:45,373 --> 00:05:47,078
at the first stop.

67
00:05:47,144 --> 00:05:48,274
We checked...

68
00:05:48,274 --> 00:05:51,659
every surveillance video of
passengers on the first train,

69
00:05:51,914 --> 00:05:54,258
and he never appeared on the platform.

70
00:05:54,584 --> 00:05:57,999
There was no one suspicious
holding a suitcase...

71
00:05:58,183 --> 00:06:00,028
big enough to fit a body in it.

72
00:06:01,924 --> 00:06:04,739
There was no way to move the
body onto the first train.

73
00:06:04,924 --> 00:06:08,208
We'll find out how he did it this time.

74
00:06:09,234 --> 00:06:12,179
Since he'll come back to dump the body.

75
00:06:13,734 --> 00:06:17,109
All right, then.
Let's head to Wangsoori Station.

76
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,378
Stop right there!

77
00:07:25,573 --> 00:07:26,878
Darn it.

78
00:07:28,313 --> 00:07:30,188
Hey. Stop...

79
00:07:42,924 --> 00:07:45,838
Shall I start working out again?

80
00:07:46,323 --> 00:07:48,638
They were the punks Metro failed to catch.

81
00:07:49,933 --> 00:07:51,378
My gosh.

82
00:07:57,003 --> 00:07:59,479
- Dad.
- What?

83
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:02,489
Chief Ko didn't call, right?

84
00:08:02,644 --> 00:08:04,758
He's probably busy.

85
00:08:05,313 --> 00:08:06,659
I guess.

86
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,729
Shall we call him and
ask if he needs any help?

87
00:08:16,654 --> 00:08:18,369
- Shall we?
- Yes.

88
00:08:23,234 --> 00:08:25,638
- Chief.
- Chief.

89
00:08:27,604 --> 00:08:28,878
Now?

90
00:08:29,774 --> 00:08:32,548
Yes, sir. I'll be there right away.

91
00:08:33,103 --> 00:08:34,178
I'll go with you.

92
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:36,849
Chief! Newbie!

93
00:08:41,414 --> 00:08:42,689
Did you have dinner?

94
00:08:42,754 --> 00:08:44,398
Do you know how late it is?

95
00:08:46,624 --> 00:08:49,668
Well, is the investigation going well?

96
00:08:49,924 --> 00:08:51,199
Let's hurry.

97
00:08:58,664 --> 00:09:01,374
Line Two heading to Sindang
and Hanyang University.

98
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,674
Line Five headed towards
Haengdang and Majang Station.

99
00:09:03,674 --> 00:09:05,743
As for Gyeonguiâ€“Jungang and Bundang lines...

100
00:09:05,744 --> 00:09:07,048
- We will...
- Us.

101
00:09:08,174 --> 00:09:10,449
Metro Team Two will provide support.

102
00:09:13,414 --> 00:09:15,989
We need to blend in with
the passengers naturally.

103
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:21,654
- The basic rule of a stakeout is...
- Disguise.

104
00:09:21,654 --> 00:09:24,494
Those belong to Chief Inspector Gong
of Team Two, so keep them clean.

105
00:09:24,494 --> 00:09:26,394
There's no need for this.

106
00:09:26,394 --> 00:09:27,469
No?

107
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:30,209
- Well, then...
- Hold on.

108
00:09:30,794 --> 00:09:32,109
- Hold it.
- Okay.

109
00:09:32,703 --> 00:09:36,303
You can wear this and sell hotteok.
"Buy some hotteok!"

110
00:09:36,303 --> 00:09:38,178
- A hiker.
- Here.

111
00:09:39,573 --> 00:09:40,678
Take this.

112
00:09:43,544 --> 00:09:44,719
Well then,

113
00:09:44,843 --> 00:09:46,888
I'll take this.

114
00:09:49,053 --> 00:09:50,459
Let's see.

115
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:52,928
I'll take this one.

116
00:10:01,664 --> 00:10:02,739
We will...

117
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,638
know once we catch him.

118
00:10:06,563 --> 00:10:08,349
If Jin is alive.

119
00:10:16,374 --> 00:10:18,489
(Wangsoori Station)

120
00:10:48,644 --> 00:10:51,119
(This is not a boarding location.)

121
00:10:55,284 --> 00:10:57,459
There's no one with a suitcase.

122
00:11:10,693 --> 00:11:15,349
The train to Sinorim is now approaching.

123
00:11:16,103 --> 00:11:17,678
Yes, Ma Ri. How's it going?

124
00:11:20,473 --> 00:11:22,018
No? We didn't find anyone either.

125
00:11:22,943 --> 00:11:24,148
Okay.

126
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:27,119
They didn't find anyone suspicious either.

127
00:11:34,053 --> 00:11:35,924
It's impossible if it isn't the first train.

128
00:11:35,924 --> 00:11:39,469
Let's get on. You can search from here.
I'll go to the front.

129
00:12:19,634 --> 00:12:21,749
- Anyone suspicious?
- No.

130
00:12:22,303 --> 00:12:24,109
- Let's keep searching.
- Okay.

131
00:12:32,713 --> 00:12:33,989
(Car 7)

132
00:12:34,313 --> 00:12:35,489
Seven?

133
00:12:36,754 --> 00:12:38,099
What's wrong?

134
00:12:40,154 --> 00:12:41,953
That boarding location sticker we saw.

135
00:12:41,953 --> 00:12:44,128
It's used when six-car trains approach.

136
00:12:45,424 --> 00:12:46,794
Since there aren't many
passengers in the morning,

137
00:12:46,794 --> 00:12:48,709
I thought six-car trains would be running.

138
00:12:50,034 --> 00:12:51,878
But this is a 10-car train.

139
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:55,602
He put up stickers intentionally...

140
00:12:55,603 --> 00:12:56,878
so people won't get on
the remaining four cars.

141
00:12:57,303 --> 00:12:58,378
Let's go.

142
00:13:00,274 --> 00:13:01,388
(Car 7)

143
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:06,859
(Car 8)

144
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:09,128
(Car 9)

145
00:13:14,953 --> 00:13:16,168
There he is.

146
00:13:17,424 --> 00:13:18,599
Open the door!

147
00:13:19,193 --> 00:13:20,599
Open it!

148
00:13:30,203 --> 00:13:31,278
Move.

149
00:13:42,053 --> 00:13:43,329
My sister.

150
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:46,128
Where is my sister?

151
00:13:50,024 --> 00:13:54,099
Tell me! What did you do with my sister?

152
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:02,709
My sister.

153
00:14:03,404 --> 00:14:05,678
Is she alive or dead?

154
00:14:07,504 --> 00:14:09,388
Just tell me that.

155
00:14:14,414 --> 00:14:17,558
Do you think she's dead or alive?

156
00:14:20,124 --> 00:14:21,798
That's what I want to know too.

157
00:14:23,624 --> 00:14:25,239
You punk.

158
00:15:02,864 --> 00:15:04,339
No!

159
00:15:15,374 --> 00:15:17,148
Newbie.

160
00:15:18,014 --> 00:15:19,614
- Newbie.
- Let go!

161
00:15:19,614 --> 00:15:22,014
I said let go of me!

162
00:15:22,014 --> 00:15:25,128
- Newbie!
- Let go of me!

163
00:15:25,506 --> 00:15:27,381
Let go!

164
00:16:21,645 --> 00:16:23,890
Newbie, look at me.

165
00:16:26,514 --> 00:16:27,720
Look at me.

166
00:16:29,385 --> 00:16:31,359
When he looked you in the eye,

167
00:16:32,385 --> 00:16:33,999
I felt my blood boil.

168
00:16:35,295 --> 00:16:38,769
When I lost him, I thought I'd lose my mind.

169
00:16:40,295 --> 00:16:43,370
But the only reason I can hang on now...

170
00:16:44,534 --> 00:16:45,980
is because I've found hope.

171
00:16:50,105 --> 00:16:51,549
He doesn't know either.

172
00:17:03,014 --> 00:17:05,184
We sent a team to the vent
that goes from the tunnel...

173
00:17:05,184 --> 00:17:06,555
to the surface.

174
00:17:06,555 --> 00:17:08,569
I made sure the train
can go to the rail yard.

175
00:17:10,895 --> 00:17:13,240
He ran into the tunnel? The tunnel?

176
00:17:14,365 --> 00:17:15,640
Are you okay, Ryung?

177
00:17:17,865 --> 00:17:19,009
I'm fine.

178
00:17:20,565 --> 00:17:23,549
He disappeared between the
platform and the turnstile.

179
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:27,319
I think I understand how now.

180
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,990
The night before the murders,

181
00:17:31,345 --> 00:17:33,960
after the Subway Ghost
prepared for the murder,

182
00:17:43,994 --> 00:17:45,924
he entered the station
and awaited his target...

183
00:17:45,924 --> 00:17:47,024
in a restricted area.

184
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:48,395
(Restricted Area)

185
00:17:48,395 --> 00:17:51,380
After he murdered his target,
he waited for nighttime again.

186
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:09,990
He went back into the tunnel,

187
00:18:10,555 --> 00:18:12,960
and went to Wangsoori Station
through which all four lines passed,

188
00:18:13,454 --> 00:18:15,194
stuck a notice not to board...

189
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:16,970
on the door of the car where
the body would be displayed.

190
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:21,940
He waited in the tunnel
for the first train...

191
00:18:27,234 --> 00:18:29,809
and opened the door from the
tunnel to place the body inside.

192
00:18:33,075 --> 00:18:36,519
He probably released the emergency
door look the night before.

193
00:18:37,145 --> 00:18:41,259
He stayed up two nights straight
and walked in the tunnel for hours.

194
00:18:42,115 --> 00:18:45,529
We're learning more and more about
him, so we'll catch him soon.

195
00:18:50,055 --> 00:18:52,069
(NFS)

196
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:55,240
Hello? Do you have the lab results?

197
00:18:56,795 --> 00:18:58,740
Yes.

198
00:19:02,105 --> 00:19:03,249
Chief.

199
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:06,845
Please send this to NFS
and have it compared...

200
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:08,849
to my DNA.

201
00:19:09,845 --> 00:19:11,220
Your DNA?

202
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:13,759
Are you saying the person here...

203
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:17,130
Just in case...

204
00:19:20,155 --> 00:19:21,329
Please, sir.

205
00:19:27,424 --> 00:19:28,539
Yes.

206
00:19:29,734 --> 00:19:30,809
Okay.

207
00:19:36,174 --> 00:19:38,279
The hairbrush we obtained
at Choi Kyung Hee's house...

208
00:19:39,805 --> 00:19:41,150
The DNA from it...

209
00:19:42,615 --> 00:19:44,450
and your DNA matched.

210
00:19:46,744 --> 00:19:48,930
- What?
- Choi Kyung Hee...

211
00:19:50,484 --> 00:19:51,960
had Jin.

212
00:19:54,024 --> 00:19:55,200
She's alive.

213
00:20:04,065 --> 00:20:07,339
Then he tried to murder her and failed.

214
00:20:07,964 --> 00:20:10,079
He didn't know where she was after that.

215
00:20:11,105 --> 00:20:12,249
That's why...

216
00:20:12,905 --> 00:20:14,749
he was curious whether
she was alive or dead.

217
00:20:36,595 --> 00:20:37,740
That's why...

218
00:20:41,165 --> 00:20:44,309
Jin has a burn scar on the back of her neck.

219
00:20:46,145 --> 00:20:49,650
He realized I wasn't her, and backed off.

220
00:20:53,115 --> 00:20:54,319
She's alive.

221
00:20:57,355 --> 00:20:59,930
Jin is alive.

222
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:05,240
Jin is alive?

223
00:21:07,325 --> 00:21:09,140
We got the DNA test results.

224
00:21:10,034 --> 00:21:11,569
The woman living in Choi
Kyung Hee's house...

225
00:21:13,135 --> 00:21:14,309
was Jin.

226
00:21:16,534 --> 00:21:17,680
I'm so glad.

227
00:21:33,585 --> 00:21:35,900
We'll look for Choi Kyung Hee.

228
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:37,900
We'll take Kim Yi Joon.

229
00:21:38,194 --> 00:21:40,125
We'll check every surveillance
video of passengers...

230
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:42,140
at stations within a
10km radius of Wangsoori.

231
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:43,964
We didn't find anything in the vent...

232
00:21:43,964 --> 00:21:45,910
leading from the tunnel to the surface.

233
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:49,835
If that's not it,
I'm sure he exited through the platform.

234
00:21:49,835 --> 00:21:51,774
We'll track Choi Kyung
Hee's credit card usage...

235
00:21:51,774 --> 00:21:54,249
and locate her cell phone
to figure out where she is.

236
00:21:54,444 --> 00:21:55,549
Okay.

237
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:01,730
Make sure...

238
00:22:02,684 --> 00:22:03,829
to find Jin.

239
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:08,299
We'll make sure to catch Kim Yi Joon.

240
00:22:10,895 --> 00:22:11,999
Yes, ma'am.

241
00:22:17,734 --> 00:22:19,779
I'm sure it rolled in here somewhere.

242
00:22:19,835 --> 00:22:21,934
- Did you find it?
- No.

243
00:22:21,934 --> 00:22:24,549
- Did you find it?
- How did I lose something this big?

244
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:38,460
Don't you know the details of an
investigation are confidential?

245
00:22:39,284 --> 00:22:41,700
I thought maybe I could help.

246
00:22:43,155 --> 00:22:44,700
It's not like I can trust you.

247
00:22:47,865 --> 00:22:49,240
I'll be blunt.

248
00:22:49,734 --> 00:22:52,609
I asked you to guard the hospital exit.

249
00:22:52,905 --> 00:22:55,480
But you lost Kim Yi Joon because
you ran after the Grasshoppers.

250
00:22:56,534 --> 00:22:57,609
Well...

251
00:22:58,034 --> 00:23:01,244
You're Subway Police,
so you saw them as the Grasshoppers.

252
00:23:01,244 --> 00:23:02,490
But to me,

253
00:23:03,145 --> 00:23:05,990
they would've looked like rats
trying to get Kim Yi Joon out.

254
00:23:07,184 --> 00:23:09,684
We need to check the
surveillance videos here,

255
00:23:09,684 --> 00:23:12,460
so go to the platform and gather the videos.

256
00:23:14,524 --> 00:23:15,599
Yes, ma'am.

257
00:23:44,585 --> 00:23:47,299
Hello, this is Chief Inspector
Ko Ji Seok of the Subway Police.

258
00:23:47,684 --> 00:23:49,155
Thank you for your cooperation.

259
00:23:49,155 --> 00:23:50,295
You worked with Choi Kyung Hee recently...

260
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:51,900
- at a hospital, right?
- Yes.

261
00:23:52,295 --> 00:23:55,694
Did you hear her say she
was going to meet someone...

262
00:23:55,694 --> 00:23:58,194
or heard about any of her friends or family?

263
00:23:58,194 --> 00:24:00,609
(Wangsoori Station)

264
00:24:00,835 --> 00:24:04,150
Choi Kyung Hee turned off her phone
and isn't using her credit cards.

265
00:24:04,504 --> 00:24:06,150
We can't find her with these.

266
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:09,049
Then we'll have to take the analog route.

267
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:11,150
- Pardon?
- I found...

268
00:24:11,545 --> 00:24:14,559
every one of her distant relatives,

269
00:24:15,155 --> 00:24:17,230
and there aren't many.
I'm sure we'll find something.

270
00:24:17,815 --> 00:24:18,930
Okay.

271
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:23,069
Okay. How should we plan our route?

272
00:24:23,924 --> 00:24:25,799
You can go here.

273
00:24:26,165 --> 00:24:27,240
What?

274
00:24:27,295 --> 00:24:29,440
It's near your mother's hospital.

275
00:24:29,665 --> 00:24:32,579
It may take a few days.
You should go see her.

276
00:24:35,234 --> 00:24:36,349
I will.

277
00:24:39,545 --> 00:24:41,319
We won't get anywhere like this.

278
00:24:41,974 --> 00:24:43,774
People keep pouring out,

279
00:24:43,774 --> 00:24:45,759
but all we see are the top of their heads.

280
00:24:51,555 --> 00:24:53,355
These cameras are there for looks,

281
00:24:53,355 --> 00:24:55,029
not for people to watch.

282
00:25:18,815 --> 00:25:20,160
What are you doing?

283
00:25:20,315 --> 00:25:22,859
Not there. Not there.

284
00:25:26,184 --> 00:25:27,400
Not there.

285
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:30,170
Not there.

286
00:25:47,674 --> 00:25:49,950
- Wait. Right there.
- No.

287
00:25:50,444 --> 00:25:51,513
What?

288
00:25:51,514 --> 00:25:54,284
His build is different.
The security cameras here...

289
00:25:54,284 --> 00:25:56,784
normally make people look bigger than usual.

290
00:25:56,784 --> 00:25:59,529
And look at his hair
sticking out from his hat.

291
00:25:59,555 --> 00:26:00,960
The length is different.

292
00:26:02,095 --> 00:26:03,900
You can actually see that?

293
00:26:04,595 --> 00:26:06,569

294
00:26:19,905 --> 00:26:22,549

295
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:30,130
What if I ruin your investigation?

296
00:26:30,184 --> 00:26:31,259
That's...

297
00:26:34,585 --> 00:26:35,970
I'm sorry.

298
00:26:41,595 --> 00:26:42,940
Well, you know,

299
00:26:43,694 --> 00:26:46,440
- it's partially our fault too.
- Right.

300
00:26:46,734 --> 00:26:47,980
Right?

301
00:26:48,534 --> 00:26:49,779

Hey...

305
00:27:38,254 --> 00:27:41,029
Ae Shim, are you asleep?

306
00:27:49,165 --> 00:27:52,779
Mom, I won't be able to come for a few days.

used to be your caretaker.

310
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:08,730

Myung Chul, was that you?

317
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:11,849
It's been a long time since
I lost touch with her.

318
00:29:12,545 --> 00:29:17,029
Well, if you get in touch with
her, can you please call me?

319
00:29:18,085 --> 00:29:19,359

00:33:16,724 --> 00:33:18,895
I'm not sure if this will reassure you,

364
00:33:18,895 --> 00:33:20,669
but you saw that house too.

365
00:33:22,224 --> 00:33:24,509
There were no traces of
her being locked inside.

366
00:33:24,594 --> 00:33:27,740
She might've been protecting her
in case her son tried to kill her.

367
00:33:29,505 --> 00:33:31,549
Protect the person who
killed her granddaughter?

368
00:33:33,204 --> 00:33:34,549
For two years?

369
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:42,060
If Jin was really alive,

370
00:33:43,085 --> 00:33:46,029
I thought there would be
nothing else to wish for.

371
00:33:47,554 --> 00:33:49,799
But now that I think she is actually alive,

372
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,770
I keep wondering how she lived,

373
00:33:53,994 --> 00:33:56,140
and if something bad happened.

374
00:33:58,434 --> 00:33:59,779
There is...

375
00:34:00,965 --> 00:34:02,680
something Woo Hyuk told me.

376
00:34:03,105 --> 00:34:04,675
They were often seen...

377
00:34:04,675 --> 00:34:06,879
grocery shopping at a
nearby traditional market.

378
00:34:08,404 --> 00:34:12,020
Everyone just thought she
was her granddaughter.

379
00:34:12,985 --> 00:34:14,359
I think...

380
00:34:15,585 --> 00:34:17,560
Jin has been doing well.

381
00:34:28,094 --> 00:34:30,669
Now, all we have to do is find her.

382
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,680
She remembers me...

383
00:34:38,434 --> 00:34:40,120
letting go of her hand.

384
00:34:42,645 --> 00:34:44,120
What if we find her,

385
00:34:45,045 --> 00:34:47,120
and she doesn't forgive me?

386
00:34:47,184 --> 00:34:48,560
Say it was a misunderstanding.

387
00:34:49,684 --> 00:34:52,029
From the moment you let go of her hand,

388
00:34:52,585 --> 00:34:54,729
tell her you've been searching for her.

389
00:34:55,895 --> 00:34:57,129
That's what you have to say.

390
00:35:01,965 --> 00:35:03,109
Would she believe me?

391
00:35:05,534 --> 00:35:07,080
I'll be your witness if she doesn't.

392
00:35:13,704 --> 00:35:15,419
"Your sister bugged me to no end,"

393
00:35:15,945 --> 00:35:18,049
"trying to find you."

394
00:35:19,485 --> 00:35:20,485
"She tied me up on the subway and ran..."

395
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:23,259
"when we first met so that she
could join the Subway Police."

396
00:35:24,054 --> 00:35:25,259
"At nights,"

397
00:35:28,855 --> 00:35:30,029
"she didn't sleep..."

398
00:35:31,025 --> 00:35:32,740
"and went into the subway tunnel."

399
00:35:33,565 --> 00:35:35,100
"How could she go there?"

400
00:35:38,565 --> 00:35:39,680
"There's more."

401
00:35:40,434 --> 00:35:42,649
"She was cursed out at Metro,"

402
00:35:43,105 --> 00:35:46,049
"but she put up with it
so she could find you."

403
00:35:48,744 --> 00:35:51,149
"Eventually,
she dragged me into Metro as well..."

404
00:35:51,645 --> 00:35:52,959
"and is making me suffer."

405
00:35:53,244 --> 00:35:55,359
It would take all night.

406
00:35:59,154 --> 00:36:00,259
You're right.

407
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:03,100
You're the best witness.

408
00:36:08,594 --> 00:36:09,669
Let's see.

409
00:36:10,395 --> 00:36:11,810
There are two places left.

410
00:36:12,804 --> 00:36:15,709
Let's go to Choi Kyung Hee's aunt's place.

411
00:36:22,775 --> 00:36:23,919
Son.

412
00:36:25,145 --> 00:36:28,089
See if there's pus oozing out of my eyes.

413
00:36:29,255 --> 00:36:30,390
Seriously.

414
00:36:31,855 --> 00:36:33,454
If we catch the Subway Ghost,

415
00:36:33,454 --> 00:36:35,200
you should get a special promotion too.

416
00:36:41,864 --> 00:36:43,140
A special promotion...

417
00:36:44,264 --> 00:36:46,979
would pay for my eldest's piano school.

418
00:36:47,904 --> 00:36:49,750
Let's go. Special promotion!

419
00:37:20,105 --> 00:37:22,109
(We race today for tomorrow)

420
00:37:24,235 --> 00:37:25,549
Found you, Yi Joon.

421
00:37:43,355 --> 00:37:44,470
Auntie.

422
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:47,339
My gosh. Kyung Hee.

423
00:37:47,864 --> 00:37:50,439
How long has it been? 10 years? 20 years?

424
00:37:50,835 --> 00:37:53,709
I'm sorry for not visiting.

425
00:37:54,434 --> 00:37:59,279
Please let me and her stay for a few days.

426
00:37:59,474 --> 00:38:01,145
Stay as long as you want.

427
00:38:01,145 --> 00:38:02,479
- Come in.
- Okay.

428
00:38:02,545 --> 00:38:03,890
- Come in.
- Let's go in.

429
00:38:54,594 --> 00:38:59,540
(Youngshin Station,
Pharmacy, Alteration shop)

430
00:39:08,175 --> 00:39:13,060
(Real Estate Agency, Our home)

431
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:24,500
(Youngshin Station, Pharmacy)

432
00:39:37,134 --> 00:39:44,950
(Our home)

433
00:39:46,344 --> 00:39:47,459
Ryung.

434
00:39:49,485 --> 00:39:53,500
(Our home)

435
00:39:55,054 --> 00:39:56,129
Ryung.

436
00:40:05,195 --> 00:40:06,709
How's Yi Joon doing?

437
00:40:08,904 --> 00:40:09,979
He's good.

438
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:13,250
- Auntie.
- Yes?

439
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:16,189
I have a favor to ask.

440
00:40:16,744 --> 00:40:19,660
If Yi Joon calls by any chance...

441
00:40:21,284 --> 00:40:23,029
The phone is ringing. Hold on.

442
00:40:27,684 --> 00:40:30,299
Hey. I haven't heard from you in so long.

443
00:40:32,454 --> 00:40:33,770
Your mom's here.

444
00:40:34,494 --> 00:40:35,569
Auntie.

445
00:40:36,735 --> 00:40:37,910
Do you want to talk to her?

446
00:40:47,304 --> 00:40:48,720
87-9.

447
00:40:49,415 --> 00:40:50,819
We're almost there.

448
00:40:56,684 --> 00:40:58,729
Did I hurt your feelings?

449
00:40:59,625 --> 00:41:01,324
You said you'd stay a few days.

450
00:41:01,324 --> 00:41:04,525
If Yi Joon comes, tell him I came alone.

451
00:41:04,525 --> 00:41:05,895
Just do that for me.

452
00:41:05,895 --> 00:41:08,925
If you're not in a rush, eat before you go.

453
00:41:08,925 --> 00:41:10,270
Did you hear me?

454
00:41:11,695 --> 00:41:13,810
You have to tell him that I came alone.

455
00:41:14,204 --> 00:41:17,310
You can't tell Yi Joon
that you saw her, okay?

456
00:41:28,715 --> 00:41:29,830
Taxi!

457
00:41:46,134 --> 00:41:48,540
- Please get out of here.
- Okay.

458
00:41:49,165 --> 00:41:50,250
Ryung.

459
00:41:51,105 --> 00:41:52,350
Just a minute, sir.

460
00:42:14,395 --> 00:42:15,770
Go to your sister now.

461
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:30,149
Hey.

462
00:42:34,085 --> 00:42:35,160
Little girl.

463
00:43:50,855 --> 00:43:51,930
It's okay.

464
00:43:54,324 --> 00:43:56,609
It's okay.

465
00:43:56,695 --> 00:43:58,370
My baby.

466
00:43:59,534 --> 00:44:02,379
You're okay, baby. It's okay.

467
00:44:02,904 --> 00:44:05,479
It's okay.

468
00:44:08,645 --> 00:44:09,720
I'm sorry.

469
00:44:10,945 --> 00:44:12,049
I'm sorry.

470
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:16,560
I'm so sorry.

471
00:44:31,764 --> 00:44:33,439
Grandma will stay with you,

472
00:44:34,565 --> 00:44:35,779
my dear Sae Rom.

473
00:44:38,134 --> 00:44:39,549
Whatever happens,

474
00:44:41,105 --> 00:44:42,379
I'll protect you.

475
00:45:03,735 --> 00:45:04,939
Jin.

476
00:45:08,835 --> 00:45:10,479
I'm sorry...

477
00:45:12,375 --> 00:45:15,149
I kept calling you Sae Rom.

478
00:45:20,114 --> 00:45:21,259
Go on now.

479
00:45:25,085 --> 00:45:27,729
I'm fine. Go on. Go.

480
00:45:28,554 --> 00:45:29,660
Go.

481
00:45:49,445 --> 00:45:51,020
Who is it?

482
00:45:53,715 --> 00:45:54,990
Are you in?

483
00:45:55,315 --> 00:45:57,560
Would you please let us in?

484
00:46:15,605 --> 00:46:17,850
Should I just keep going straight?

485
00:46:18,335 --> 00:46:19,750
Well...

486
00:46:20,844 --> 00:46:22,049
So...

487
00:46:23,545 --> 00:46:27,214
Please take us to Chungrim
Mental Health Hospital.

488
00:46:27,215 --> 00:46:28,319
Yes, ma'am.

489
00:46:35,025 --> 00:46:36,200
(Restricted Area)

490
00:46:44,335 --> 00:46:46,009
Please.

491
00:46:46,295 --> 00:46:49,279
Come to Sunil Motel.

492
00:46:52,235 --> 00:46:53,379
No.

493
00:47:10,125 --> 00:47:11,399
Auntie!

494
00:47:13,864 --> 00:47:15,600
Turn yourself in.

495
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:18,410
I... I saw everything.

496
00:47:20,634 --> 00:47:23,910
I told you to keep quiet.
Pretend you didn't see anything.

497
00:47:24,034 --> 00:47:27,244
But... The detective...

498
00:47:27,244 --> 00:47:30,990
will catch you and that man.

499
00:47:32,415 --> 00:47:33,620
Auntie.

500
00:47:37,384 --> 00:47:39,560
I have someone I must protect.

501
00:47:40,355 --> 00:47:42,500
You may not understand things like that.

502
00:47:45,755 --> 00:47:48,770
Someone you must protect.

503
00:47:49,494 --> 00:47:50,939
Newbie...

504
00:47:53,235 --> 00:47:55,410
is very precious to me.

505
00:47:55,835 --> 00:47:59,005
And I want to protect her as much as you.

506
00:47:59,005 --> 00:48:00,850
That detective out to catch me,

507
00:48:01,804 --> 00:48:04,120
the guy you call "Sweetie,"

508
00:48:04,974 --> 00:48:06,390
is your son.

509
00:48:07,585 --> 00:48:09,359
Recognize him already.

510
00:48:10,355 --> 00:48:12,790
Stop breaking your child's heart.

511
00:48:15,654 --> 00:48:17,100
Excuse me.

512
00:48:18,025 --> 00:48:19,754
How old are you?

513
00:48:19,755 --> 00:48:23,094
My sweet Ae Shim. Sorry I'm late.

514
00:48:23,094 --> 00:48:25,335
- Mom.
- Get out!

515
00:48:25,335 --> 00:48:26,640
Mom!

516
00:48:28,134 --> 00:48:30,850
It's me, Mom. It's me.

517
00:48:30,934 --> 00:48:33,109
It's me, Ji Seok.

518
00:48:34,105 --> 00:48:35,350
Mom.

519
00:48:56,665 --> 00:48:58,370
Ji Seok.

520
00:48:59,094 --> 00:49:00,879
I'm so sorry.

521
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:05,149
I need to find the woman who
used to be your caretaker.

522
00:49:05,934 --> 00:49:07,819
No.

523
00:49:14,114 --> 00:49:16,359
I have someone I need to protect too.

524
00:49:19,985 --> 00:49:21,585
My son said...

525
00:49:21,585 --> 00:49:25,855
he wants to catch you so
he can protect someone.

526
00:49:25,855 --> 00:49:27,195
Let go.

527
00:49:27,195 --> 00:49:28,665
You know my son, right?

528
00:49:28,665 --> 00:49:30,240
The poor thing.

529
00:49:30,934 --> 00:49:34,204
He gave up everything he had because of me.

530
00:49:34,204 --> 00:49:36,310
His dreams, his future, everything.

531
00:49:37,204 --> 00:49:41,680
I can't take her away from him too.

532
00:49:43,614 --> 00:49:45,549
The person my son cherishes...

533
00:49:45,715 --> 00:49:48,689
I must protect her.

534
00:49:50,085 --> 00:49:51,890
If I don't go now,

535
00:49:53,184 --> 00:49:55,700
my son will kill the girl named Yoo Jin.

536
00:49:56,355 --> 00:49:58,200
Then my son...

537
00:49:59,525 --> 00:50:02,970
My son will kill himself too.

538
00:50:03,594 --> 00:50:05,009
Then I...

539
00:50:05,735 --> 00:50:09,540
I'd lose two children. So, please...

540
00:50:10,034 --> 00:50:11,950
Please let go.

541
00:50:12,005 --> 00:50:14,720
Please let me go!

542
00:50:24,815 --> 00:50:26,259
Ms. Han.

543
00:50:29,312 --> 00:50:31,956
Ms. Han.

544
00:50:48,037 --> 00:50:50,011
Mom.

545
00:50:51,736 --> 00:50:53,252
Mom.

546
00:50:54,646 --> 00:50:56,776
What happened?

547
00:50:56,776 --> 00:50:58,977
She has a concussion.

548
00:50:58,977 --> 00:51:01,391
We called the police.

549
00:51:01,517 --> 00:51:04,916
She had a scuffle with her caretaker.

550
00:51:04,916 --> 00:51:06,761
The caretaker was running away,

551
00:51:06,887 --> 00:51:09,657
and Ms. Han held onto her
and fought with her...

552
00:51:09,657 --> 00:51:10,896
when the caretaker pushed her away.

553
00:51:10,896 --> 00:51:12,132
The caretaker...

554
00:51:13,666 --> 00:51:15,426
She was here?

555
00:51:15,427 --> 00:51:19,112
Yes. I think so. Okay, then.

556
00:51:27,376 --> 00:51:28,681
But...

557
00:51:29,307 --> 00:51:31,192
why did Mom and that woman...

558
00:51:31,416 --> 00:51:32,891
Ji Seok.

559
00:51:54,836 --> 00:51:56,042
Mom.

560
00:51:57,006 --> 00:51:58,411
Do you recognize me?

561
00:52:00,376 --> 00:52:01,552
Yes.

562
00:52:04,916 --> 00:52:06,592
I'm sorry...

563
00:52:07,617 --> 00:52:10,031
for not recognizing you for so long.

564
00:52:13,986 --> 00:52:15,331
No, no.

565
00:52:17,896 --> 00:52:21,002
It's Sunil Motel.

566
00:52:22,626 --> 00:52:25,612
Auntie Kyung Hee said she was going there.

567
00:52:26,566 --> 00:52:27,811
What?

568
00:52:28,407 --> 00:52:30,411
Sunil Motel.

569
00:52:32,537 --> 00:52:34,922
I'm sorry...

570
00:52:35,407 --> 00:52:37,851
this is all I can do for you.

571
00:52:40,617 --> 00:52:41,922
Mom.

572
00:52:43,986 --> 00:52:45,617
Why did you stop her?

573
00:52:45,617 --> 00:52:48,761
Why did you do it? Why?
Why did you stop her?

574
00:52:49,657 --> 00:52:52,302
My son said...

575
00:52:53,526 --> 00:52:56,302
he wanted to protect her.

576
00:52:57,896 --> 00:52:59,141
Mom.

577
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:03,281
Here.

578
00:53:14,646 --> 00:53:15,991
Ji Seok.

579
00:53:19,316 --> 00:53:22,632
When you were first born,

580
00:53:23,657 --> 00:53:25,272
your chest...

581
00:53:25,827 --> 00:53:27,772
was this big.

582
00:53:28,396 --> 00:53:30,672
When I leaned...

583
00:53:31,796 --> 00:53:34,612
against that tiny chest,

584
00:53:36,006 --> 00:53:39,212
it made me feel so secure...

585
00:53:39,836 --> 00:53:41,721
and comforted.

586
00:53:44,316 --> 00:53:45,891
Now, it's...

587
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:51,531
Well, it goes without saying.

588
00:53:53,856 --> 00:53:55,061
To me,

589
00:53:56,557 --> 00:53:57,902
your chest...

590
00:53:58,896 --> 00:54:01,072
is the broadest in the
world, and it makes me...

591
00:54:01,967 --> 00:54:03,101
feel secure.

592
00:54:10,037 --> 00:54:11,212
So...

593
00:54:13,336 --> 00:54:16,022
don't try so hard because of me.

594
00:54:19,617 --> 00:54:22,661
My son doesn't need to do that.

595
00:55:25,776 --> 00:55:29,061
Police. Did two women check into a room?

596
00:55:29,086 --> 00:55:31,316
I just started my shift, so I'm not sure.

597
00:55:31,316 --> 00:55:32,491
Let's split up and check.

598
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:49,181
Police.

599
00:55:55,546 --> 00:55:57,752
Police. Your cooperation is requested.

600
00:55:58,046 --> 00:56:01,022
If you don't open up,
I'll have to force my way in.

601
00:56:11,526 --> 00:56:13,371
Jin.

602
00:56:18,267 --> 00:56:19,371
Jin.

603
00:56:28,347 --> 00:56:29,482
Jin.

604
00:57:13,387 --> 00:57:14,561
Don't come closer.

605
00:57:16,787 --> 00:57:18,302
I'm not here for you.

606
00:57:21,626 --> 00:57:22,971
I came to find my sister.

607
00:57:25,497 --> 00:57:26,572
Jin.

608
00:57:27,736 --> 00:57:29,081
Where's Jin?

609
00:57:29,867 --> 00:57:31,181
If you want to find your sister,

610
00:57:33,307 --> 00:57:34,652
catch my son first.

611
00:57:36,847 --> 00:57:38,652
When Yi Joon goes to meet Sae Rom,

612
00:57:39,646 --> 00:57:42,362
the last person he wants
to take with him is Jin.

613
00:57:42,447 --> 00:57:45,387
So tell me right now before he finds her!

614
00:57:45,387 --> 00:57:49,331
He knows that I'm running with Jin.

615
00:57:50,626 --> 00:57:52,331
Obviously, he knows...

616
00:57:53,327 --> 00:57:56,172
that I'll give her to you if I'm cornered.

617
00:57:56,566 --> 00:58:00,112
It's more dangerous for
her if she's with you.

618
00:58:03,137 --> 00:58:04,281
You know...

619
00:58:05,776 --> 00:58:07,252
how frightening Yi Joon is,

620
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:10,081
and what he's capable of.

621
00:58:12,747 --> 00:58:14,462
Stop talking as if you care about Jin.

622
00:58:16,117 --> 00:58:18,161
What you did was kidnapping.

623
00:58:18,586 --> 00:58:22,061
For the past two years,
my life has been pure torment.

624
00:58:23,657 --> 00:58:24,931
I'm sure it was...

625
00:58:25,727 --> 00:58:26,971
the same for Jin.

626
00:58:31,666 --> 00:58:32,811
I'm sorry.

627
00:58:36,807 --> 00:58:37,882
But...

628
00:58:40,706 --> 00:58:42,822
if even Jin dies now,

629
00:58:45,517 --> 00:58:47,962
I'll have no reason to live.

630
00:59:03,367 --> 00:59:04,811
You were good...

631
00:59:06,967 --> 00:59:08,382
to Jin, right?

632
00:59:10,376 --> 00:59:13,011
She ate well, slept well,

633
00:59:13,606 --> 00:59:15,121
and was well, right?

634
00:59:23,247 --> 00:59:24,391
But...

635
00:59:27,787 --> 00:59:29,862
I can't do that anymore.

636
00:59:35,267 --> 00:59:37,112
If I tell you where she is,

637
00:59:38,197 --> 00:59:39,411
can you make sure...

638
00:59:40,137 --> 00:59:42,612
Yi Joon never finds her?

639
00:59:47,177 --> 00:59:48,322
Where is she?

640
00:59:49,006 --> 00:59:50,252
Jin is...

641
00:59:56,017 --> 00:59:57,292
I don't know where she is.

642
01:00:08,896 --> 01:00:09,971
Mom.

643
01:00:11,637 --> 01:00:13,112
Why did you stop talking?

644
01:01:03,816 --> 01:01:05,617
(Catch the Ghost)

645
01:01:05,617 --> 01:01:07,287
Jin!

646
01:01:07,287 --> 01:01:10,772
Should I tell you how your sister
looked when I last saw her?

647
01:01:11,097 --> 01:01:13,672
I'm so sorry, Jin.

648
01:01:13,867 --> 01:01:15,641
I know your sister abandoned you.

649
01:01:15,896 --> 01:01:20,371
But she has been waiting for you
without resting for a single minute.

650
01:01:20,666 --> 01:01:23,181
If you don't kill me now,
your sister will die.

651
01:01:23,637 --> 01:01:26,951
Because as long as I'm breathing,
I will find her and kill her.

652
01:01:26,977 --> 01:01:29,252
This is my final warning. Drop the knife!

653
01:01:32,077 --> 01:01:33,152
Jin.

654
01:01:50,197 --> 01:01:52,471
New drama, "Black Dog".
