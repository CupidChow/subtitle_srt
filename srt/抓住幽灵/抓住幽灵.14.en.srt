00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,800
CATCH THE GHOST

2
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,867
{\an8}CATCH THE GHOST

3
00:00:24,934 --> 00:00:25,867
THIS DRAMA IS FICTION

4
00:00:25,934 --> 00:00:27,834
THE CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
INSTITUTIONS, AND EVENTS AREN'T REAL

5
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:31,200
{\an8}<i>Within a week,
we'll catch the Subway Ghost.</i>

6
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,600
{\an8}<i>I'll go get him.</i>

7
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:34,266
{\an8}<i>Stop right there!</i>

8
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:39,667
{\an8}PREVIOUSLY

9
00:00:39,734 --> 00:00:40,934
{\an8}<i>I got you.</i>

10
00:00:41,734 --> 00:00:43,433
{\an8}Jin... Where is she?

11
00:00:43,767 --> 00:00:45,033
{\an8}Your sister...

12
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:49,200
{\an8}<i>She's alive.</i>

13
00:00:51,367 --> 00:00:53,533
{\an8}<i>I'm a witness,</i>

14
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,867
{\an8}not a murderer.

15
00:00:57,567 --> 00:00:58,867
{\an8}Stop with your lies.

16
00:00:58,934 --> 00:01:01,266
{\an8}You killed her!

17
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:03,066
{\an8}-What are you doing?
-Rookie!

18
00:01:03,133 --> 00:01:04,166
{\an8}Jin...

19
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:07,367
{\an8}<i>Was she really breathing?</i>

20
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:09,867
{\an8}Write down every fence
who bought the stolen goods from you.

21
00:01:10,233 --> 00:01:12,567
{\an8}He receives stolen goods
at the hospital only by mail.

22
00:01:12,633 --> 00:01:13,767
{\an8}This man seems suspicious.

23
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,900
{\an8}This is where Ji-seok's mom
is hospitalized.

24
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:20,000
{\an8}Be quiet.

25
00:01:20,367 --> 00:01:22,266
{\an8}<i>It happened about three years ago.</i>

26
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:26,567
{\an8}<i>A mentally-ill homeless man pushed a child
onto the tracks at Wangsuri Station.</i>

27
00:01:26,633 --> 00:01:29,767
{\an8}I think the Regional Investigation Unit
found that homeless man.

28
00:01:29,834 --> 00:01:32,200
{\an8}<i>It seems like the Subway Police
found that case.</i>

29
00:01:32,266 --> 00:01:34,667
{\an8}So you're saying that Kim Cheol-jin,
who's in a psychiatric ward,

30
00:01:34,734 --> 00:01:37,600
{\an8}<i>is the homeless man
who pushed the girl onto the tracks</i>

31
00:01:37,667 --> 00:01:39,333
{\an8}<i>and killed her?</i>

32
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,333
{\an8}Hello, ma'am.

33
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,934
{\an8}It's dangerous, so don't leave the room.

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,033
{\an8}There's a murder suspect at that hospital.

35
00:01:55,133 --> 00:01:56,200
{\an8}Auntie.

36
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:58,567
{\an8}EPISODE 14

37
00:02:05,867 --> 00:02:08,000
Turn left over there
and we'll reach the hospital.

38
00:03:13,734 --> 00:03:14,567
Auntie.

39
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,367
You shouldn't let him out.

40
00:03:46,867 --> 00:03:48,033
Excuse us.

41
00:03:49,433 --> 00:03:50,266
We're the police.

42
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:52,767
-Please cooperate with our investigation.
-Investigation?

43
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:55,667
-Which way is the closed ward?
-That way.

44
00:04:05,834 --> 00:04:06,734
Quiet.

45
00:04:08,934 --> 00:04:10,100
Quiet.

46
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,967
Don't follow us.

47
00:04:31,233 --> 00:04:32,166
This way, please.

48
00:04:46,834 --> 00:04:47,934
Where is this bastard?

49
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,734
Who opened the door for him? And when?

50
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,467
Who could've...

51
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:02,867
I don't know. About 20 minutes ago,

52
00:05:02,934 --> 00:05:05,367
when I came to give him
his medicine, he was here.

53
00:05:05,433 --> 00:05:08,600
If it's been 20 minutes, it's very likely
that he's still in the hospital.

54
00:05:08,667 --> 00:05:10,934
Guard the front and back gates.
I'll call for backup.

55
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,700
-Should I...
-I'll take the back gate.

56
00:05:12,767 --> 00:05:13,800
Okay.

57
00:05:13,867 --> 00:05:16,200
-Kim Wu-hyeok, check the security footage.
-Okay.

58
00:05:16,266 --> 00:05:18,934
Detective Yoo, go through
Kim Cheol-jin's visitor list.

59
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,934
If he's left, we must
search his acquaintances first.

60
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Okay.

61
00:05:22,066 --> 00:05:23,834
-We will search this area first.
-Okay.

62
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:24,967
I'll go search the second floor.

63
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,900
-I'll take the third floor.
-I'll go to the first floor.

64
00:05:52,467 --> 00:05:53,433
Excuse me.

65
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:58,433
I need to check something.
May I take a look at your ID card please?

66
00:06:02,266 --> 00:06:05,834
Hello. We need to check your identity.
May we take a look at your ID card?

67
00:06:16,266 --> 00:06:17,100
Thank you.

68
00:06:19,266 --> 00:06:20,700
Medical records.

69
00:06:20,767 --> 00:06:22,000
Names of the doctors and nurses

70
00:06:22,066 --> 00:06:23,800
and every treatment history
are written here, right?

71
00:06:23,867 --> 00:06:24,700
Yes.

72
00:06:31,967 --> 00:06:33,567
Are you looking for Ae-sim?

73
00:06:34,033 --> 00:06:34,867
Yes.

74
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,266
Is Mom not in her room?

75
00:06:38,567 --> 00:06:41,967
Her caretaker ran off,

76
00:06:42,033 --> 00:06:45,767
and Ae-sim came out
and ran after the caretaker.

77
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,433
Something must be going on.

78
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,734
<i>It's dangerous, so don't leave the room.</i>

79
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,800
There's a murder suspect at that hospital.

80
00:06:54,867 --> 00:06:55,700
<i>Okay.</i>

81
00:06:56,834 --> 00:06:58,433
I told her not to leave the room.

82
00:06:59,734 --> 00:07:02,667
She told me that her son is sick at heart.

83
00:07:02,734 --> 00:07:04,400
That's why she works here.

84
00:07:04,467 --> 00:07:06,667
Your mother is mistaken.

85
00:07:07,633 --> 00:07:08,767
I don't have a son.

86
00:07:08,834 --> 00:07:09,767
Wait.

87
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:11,800
Wait!

88
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,467
The son who is sick at heart.

89
00:07:15,533 --> 00:07:16,934
<i>I'm on the Subway Police.</i>

90
00:07:18,467 --> 00:07:20,000
Then...

91
00:07:20,066 --> 00:07:23,900
You must be investigating
the subway serial murder case.

92
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,033
The subway serial murder?

93
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,400
Where's the wheelchair storage room?

94
00:08:07,467 --> 00:08:09,066
Well...

95
00:08:09,133 --> 00:08:11,300
It's next to the pharmacy
on the first floor.

96
00:08:12,233 --> 00:08:13,233
I see.

97
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,800
Thank you.

98
00:08:51,433 --> 00:08:52,834
Have you seen anyone suspicious?

99
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,567
Where's she gone?

100
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,567
Auntie.

101
00:09:13,633 --> 00:09:14,567
Auntie.

102
00:09:16,133 --> 00:09:17,066
Auntie.

103
00:09:20,967 --> 00:09:22,734
RESTRICTED AREA

104
00:09:53,734 --> 00:09:57,133
It's okay. I'll protect you.

105
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,433
{\an8}KIM CHEOL-JIN'S MEDICAL RECORDS

106
00:10:06,266 --> 00:10:07,500
He hasn't had any visitors.

107
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,800
Art treatment twice a week
by Park Seon-yeong.

108
00:10:13,867 --> 00:10:15,400
Kinesiotherapy once a week.

109
00:10:15,467 --> 00:10:16,934
KINESIOTHERAPIST KIM I-JUN

110
00:10:18,633 --> 00:10:19,734
Why is his name on here?

111
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:32,867
I told you not to follow me.

112
00:12:22,734 --> 00:12:23,600
<i>Kim I-jun.</i>

113
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,166
Kim I-jun.

114
00:12:33,734 --> 00:12:36,300
Detective Kim,
did you look into Kim I-jun's family?

115
00:12:36,367 --> 00:12:38,433
<i>I was just taking a look at it.</i>

116
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,166
Does he have a daughter?

117
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,200
He has a deceased daughter?

118
00:12:53,266 --> 00:12:54,200
Chief Ha.

119
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,333
Kim I-jun's daughter was the victim
that was pushed onto the tracks.

120
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,133
What? What are you talking about?

121
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:04,500
The case file was just restored,
so we checked the identity of the victim.

122
00:13:04,567 --> 00:13:06,633
The victim who was pushed
by Kim Cheol-jin and died

123
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,633
was a ten-year-old named Kim Sae-rom.

124
00:13:09,867 --> 00:13:11,166
And Kim I-jun's daughter is...

125
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,734
KIM I-JUN'S DAUGHTER
KIM SAE-ROM, DECEASED

126
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,633
It's Kim Sae-rom.

127
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,166
She died when she was ten years old.

128
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,266
So, Kim I-jun is...

129
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:24,166
He was the one who set the police up
to go after Kim Cheol-jin.

130
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,266
Kim Cheol-jin was transferred
to another hospital

131
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,633
every time there was a murder
by the Subway Ghost.

132
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,800
The records said he had kinesiotherapy
every time before his seizures.

133
00:13:32,867 --> 00:13:34,800
The kinesiotherapist's name was Kim I-jun.

134
00:13:43,967 --> 00:13:44,967
Detective Kim.

135
00:13:45,767 --> 00:13:48,433
Start questioning Kim I-jun immediately.

136
00:13:48,734 --> 00:13:49,867
Okay, I will...

137
00:13:51,734 --> 00:13:52,567
Detective Lee.

138
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:54,633
Detective Lee!

139
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,667
<i>What? What is it?</i>

140
00:13:57,266 --> 00:13:58,600
Kim I-jun escaped.

141
00:14:08,266 --> 00:14:11,533
In order to frame
Kim Cheol-jin for all the murders,

142
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,300
Kim I-jun left Kim Cheol-jin's fingerprint
on the payphone coin

143
00:14:14,367 --> 00:14:15,600
and mimicked his tic.

144
00:14:15,667 --> 00:14:17,133
To make up his alibi...

145
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:21,033
The Locust Swarm members said
they saw the suitcase and necklace.

146
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,266
They didn't seem to be lying.

147
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:25,000
I think he formed
the Locust Swarm that travels

148
00:14:25,066 --> 00:14:27,266
through the tunnel
in order to make his alibi.

149
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,133
The night they saw the suitcase together

150
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,567
probably wasn't the day
he actually killed someone.

151
00:14:32,266 --> 00:14:35,533
He left an empty suitcase there
and formed his alibi.

152
00:14:35,867 --> 00:14:39,367
The only one who saw the inside
of the suitcase was Kim I-jun.

153
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,700
Why did someone so thorough

154
00:14:43,767 --> 00:14:46,300
leave his real name
in the hospital records?

155
00:14:51,033 --> 00:14:53,500
He set it up so that
Kim Cheol-jin is accused

156
00:14:53,567 --> 00:14:56,066
and his identity would be
revealed in the end.

157
00:14:56,934 --> 00:15:00,066
His plan is to kill Kim Cheol-jin
and let the world know about the truth

158
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:01,734
and his daughter's wrongful death.

159
00:15:03,066 --> 00:15:05,000
Kim Cheol-jin is his last target.

160
00:15:05,633 --> 00:15:07,533
Kim I-jun is the one
who took Kim Cheol-jin.

161
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,433
No.

162
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:12,066
The person who took Kim Cheol-jin
was caught on the security camera.

163
00:15:21,867 --> 00:15:23,934
-Ms. Choi.
-Do you know her?

164
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,300
She's my mother's caretaker.

165
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:30,600
-Ms. Choi Gyeong-hui.
-Wait.

166
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Choi Gyeong-hui...

167
00:15:38,834 --> 00:15:43,934
{\an8}KIM I-JUN'S MOTHER
CHOI GYEONG-HUI

168
00:16:02,967 --> 00:16:03,934
Please.

169
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,300
Kim I-jun is definitely in this hospital.

170
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:28,367
Search the convalescent ward,
outpatient ward,

171
00:16:28,433 --> 00:16:30,400
closed ward, and restricted areas.

172
00:16:30,467 --> 00:16:31,500
-Okay.
-Okay.

173
00:16:37,867 --> 00:16:39,567
Your mother followed Choi Gyeong-hui,

174
00:16:39,633 --> 00:16:41,300
and Kim I-jun will look for
Choi Gyeong-hui.

175
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:43,433
So there is a high chance
that they are together.

176
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,500
Once we find Kim I-jun,
we'll find your mother, too.

177
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:57,734
I'm begging you.

178
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,266
Please stop, I-jun.

179
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,633
Move.

180
00:17:03,467 --> 00:17:04,500
Please.

181
00:17:06,367 --> 00:17:07,600
Look at this bastard's eyes.

182
00:17:09,767 --> 00:17:10,867
He's scared.

183
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,100
He's scared that he's going to die.

184
00:17:15,967 --> 00:17:17,700
You're scared of your own death,

185
00:17:19,633 --> 00:17:21,567
but you think
other people's deaths are funny?

186
00:17:48,633 --> 00:17:50,100
My baby!

187
00:17:50,834 --> 00:17:52,000
Sae-rom!

188
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,033
What the heck?

189
00:18:17,233 --> 00:18:18,266
That bastard.

190
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,400
What is that bastard doing?

191
00:18:50,567 --> 00:18:53,166
-You're under arrest for theft.
-Let go of me.

192
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:54,367
I saw everything.

193
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,767
-You can't get away with it this time...
-Let go of me!

194
00:18:59,834 --> 00:19:03,667
<i>This train is for Sinorim.</i>

195
00:19:03,734 --> 00:19:05,734
-Let's go.
-I said, let go!

196
00:19:06,567 --> 00:19:07,567
You bastard!

197
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,700
<i>The train is now approaching.</i>

198
00:19:19,767 --> 00:19:20,600
Wait!

199
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,367
Wait.

200
00:19:24,667 --> 00:19:25,667
No!

201
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,066
Sae-rom!

202
00:20:08,367 --> 00:20:09,767
Why are you here, Mom?

203
00:20:13,734 --> 00:20:15,467
Is it the accomplices who killed Sae-rom

204
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:18,934
helping each other?

205
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,066
I-jun.

206
00:20:20,967 --> 00:20:23,266
You took Sae-rom,
saying that you'll take care of her.

207
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,233
But you left her alone
to go to work all the time.

208
00:20:30,533 --> 00:20:31,433
That day...

209
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,633
You got her killed
because you made her go out by herself.

210
00:20:39,533 --> 00:20:40,834
I told you.

211
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,734
When I was young...

212
00:20:47,667 --> 00:20:49,934
I hated being alone
more than anything in the world.

213
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,767
I told you that I would earn the money

214
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,166
so please don't leave Sae-rom alone.

215
00:21:00,934 --> 00:21:03,900
So why are you
protecting this bastard here?

216
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:06,834
Are you afraid the cops might take him?

217
00:21:08,633 --> 00:21:10,367
Because he's innocent?

218
00:21:10,667 --> 00:21:12,800
Because I'm the one
who murdered all those people?

219
00:21:13,934 --> 00:21:16,066
Because you're afraid
he would be falsely accused?

220
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,567
Just why are you here?

221
00:21:20,934 --> 00:21:22,533
To save you.

222
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,834
What?

223
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,900
The fact that the cops are
looking for him means

224
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,200
everything is going as you planned.

225
00:21:36,767 --> 00:21:38,767
And I know

226
00:21:40,266 --> 00:21:41,734
what the end of that plan is.

227
00:21:45,033 --> 00:21:45,934
This...

228
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,133
This is your last stop.

229
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,000
Once he dies,

230
00:21:55,533 --> 00:21:58,834
you're going to join Sae-rom, too.
I can't let that happen.

231
00:21:59,367 --> 00:22:01,333
No.

232
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,467
I can't lose you, too.

233
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,233
I can't lose you, too. I won't.

234
00:22:13,567 --> 00:22:14,400
I-jun.

235
00:22:33,767 --> 00:22:36,100
PERSONNEL ONLY

236
00:22:40,266 --> 00:22:41,433
What's going on?

237
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,900
Mi-hyeon, we are doing an investigation.

238
00:22:44,967 --> 00:22:46,767
In this ward, are there
more restricted areas

239
00:22:46,834 --> 00:22:49,567
other than here, the night-duty room,
and the janitors' storage?

240
00:22:50,533 --> 00:22:51,467
No, that's it.

241
00:22:51,533 --> 00:22:54,633
Is there anywhere that people
don't know about or can't access?

242
00:22:55,467 --> 00:22:58,400
There is a machine room on B1.

243
00:22:58,467 --> 00:23:01,900
Once the building was rebuilt,
it is now used as a storage room.

244
00:23:01,967 --> 00:23:04,700
They store old stuff there,
so I've never been there either.

245
00:23:04,767 --> 00:23:05,600
B1.

246
00:23:06,433 --> 00:23:08,700
-Let's go.
-Wait, Ryeong.

247
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:13,367
Are you investigating
the Subway Ghost now?

248
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:17,367
Do those murders have something
to do with Mr. Kim Cheol-jin?

249
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,600
Do you know Kim Cheol-jin?

250
00:23:19,667 --> 00:23:22,633
No, I heard his name
when the cops were looking for him.

251
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,934
Let's talk later.
I have something to ask you, too.

252
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,934
Bye.

253
00:23:36,533 --> 00:23:37,800
"Defendant Kim Cheol-jin...

254
00:23:40,734 --> 00:23:43,166
perceived other people
as the targets at the time of his crime

255
00:23:44,967 --> 00:23:47,100
due to the delusion
caused by schizophrenia."

256
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,767
"Based on Article Ten Clause One
of the Criminal Procedure Act...

257
00:23:52,834 --> 00:23:54,734
he is recognized as someone
who can't make...

258
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:00,133
his own decision
due to a mental and physical disorder."

259
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,700
"So the Court finds the defendant...

260
00:24:07,033 --> 00:24:08,500
not guilty."

261
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,600
I still don't understand what that means.

262
00:24:17,233 --> 00:24:18,867
I don't agree with the ruling, either.

263
00:24:30,667 --> 00:24:32,166
I'll judge you again.

264
00:24:34,266 --> 00:24:35,800
Defendant Kim Cheol-jin...

265
00:24:38,166 --> 00:24:40,567
brutally murdered

266
00:24:42,467 --> 00:24:43,633
Kim Sae-rom...

267
00:24:46,734 --> 00:24:49,066
who is Kim I-jun's one and only daughter.

268
00:24:52,967 --> 00:24:54,700
Hence, the judge sentences him to death.

269
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,433
I-jun!

270
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,734
No. Don't do it.

271
00:25:17,734 --> 00:25:19,467
No, I-jun.

272
00:25:19,533 --> 00:25:22,266
No, I-jun. Stop!

273
00:25:23,433 --> 00:25:24,567
No.

274
00:25:26,934 --> 00:25:28,200
Don't do it.

275
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,367
I-jun.

276
00:26:24,867 --> 00:26:26,166
I killed

277
00:26:27,233 --> 00:26:28,533
Kim Cheol-jin.

278
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,367
I'll turn myself in.

279
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:36,934
So run away and live your life.

280
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,367
Please, I-jun.

281
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:43,567
Don't worry. I won't die.

282
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,734
No, I can't die.

283
00:26:49,133 --> 00:26:50,967
I still have one thing left to do.

284
00:26:57,367 --> 00:26:58,367
"One thing left to do"?

285
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:16,033
RESTRICTED AREA

286
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:24,600
Captain!

287
00:27:46,734 --> 00:27:47,567
Mom.

288
00:27:50,967 --> 00:27:52,000
Mom.

289
00:27:53,633 --> 00:27:54,767
Mom!

290
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:57,900
Mom...

291
00:28:10,233 --> 00:28:11,066
Mom.

292
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:14,133
Mom!

293
00:28:17,567 --> 00:28:18,400
I'm scared.

294
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:24,600
What are you doing here?

295
00:28:24,967 --> 00:28:26,367
Come here.

296
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,367
Let me see. Are you all right?

297
00:28:30,433 --> 00:28:32,900
Are you hurt? Let me see.

298
00:28:32,967 --> 00:28:33,834
Let me have a look.

299
00:28:35,934 --> 00:28:37,133
What happened to your hand?

300
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:41,967
Are you okay? Talk to me.

301
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,700
Mom.

302
00:28:47,633 --> 00:28:49,300
It's me. Look at me.

303
00:28:49,667 --> 00:28:51,967
Look at my face. Don't you recognize me?

304
00:28:52,734 --> 00:28:55,066
It's me, Mom. It's me.

305
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:58,266
<i>Ae-sim. I'm late, aren't I?</i>

306
00:29:02,433 --> 00:29:03,934
Open wide.

307
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,066
Please remember me, Mom.

308
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,734
Right? I'm all grown up now.

309
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:15,600
I'm your son. Mom, it's me, Ji-seok!

310
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,033
What's wrong, Mom?

311
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,333
Please say something, Mom!

312
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,633
Look at me, Mom.

313
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,734
-Captain.
-Let go of me!

314
00:29:30,834 --> 00:29:33,033
-Let go.
-She's not in her right mind now.

315
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,600
Miss.

316
00:29:50,066 --> 00:29:52,700
Are you all right?

317
00:29:54,567 --> 00:29:55,400
Yes.

318
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,567
Are you hurt?

319
00:30:01,567 --> 00:30:02,500
No.

320
00:30:05,633 --> 00:30:06,900
It's a relief.

321
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:11,734
Did you meet anyone here?

322
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,333
I remember.

323
00:30:28,767 --> 00:30:29,600
I saw that man.

324
00:30:40,533 --> 00:30:43,266
You didn't see anyone else?

325
00:30:43,333 --> 00:30:44,700
No.

326
00:30:47,333 --> 00:30:50,533
I got lost.

327
00:30:54,467 --> 00:30:57,834
Please take her to her room.
She needs to rest.

328
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,300
Let's go.

329
00:31:03,166 --> 00:31:07,066
I'll walk you to your room.

330
00:31:30,133 --> 00:31:30,967
Chief Ha.

331
00:31:32,133 --> 00:31:35,100
They were in the storage room
of the convalescent ward on B1.

332
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,033
Please keep everyone out.

333
00:31:39,867 --> 00:31:41,567
LIGHTNING COURIER SERVICE

334
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:44,066
Shit.

335
00:31:44,133 --> 00:31:46,800
This has been the best week of my life.

336
00:31:46,867 --> 00:31:49,867
I was called the Subway Ghost,
and I escaped from the police.

337
00:31:51,133 --> 00:31:52,166
By the way...

338
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,767
-When did Boss prepare this truck?
-I guess he felt bad for turning us in.

339
00:31:57,834 --> 00:31:59,467
He went the extra mile.

340
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,333
He even went to get my medicine for me.

341
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,467
I forgive you, Boss.

342
00:32:06,834 --> 00:32:08,467
He told us to come to the parking lot.

343
00:32:09,367 --> 00:32:11,200
Going in isn't a problem, but...

344
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,400
Oh, forget it.

345
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,467
{\an8}INSPECTION IN PROGRESS

346
00:32:28,233 --> 00:32:31,100

347
00:33:51,333 --> 00:33:54,033
I'M THE VICTIM

348
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:57,166
"I'm the victim."

349
00:34:02,133 --> 00:34:03,133
Victim...

350
00:34:13,834 --> 00:34:15,967
Excuse us. We are doing an inspection.

351
00:34:16,033 --> 00:34:17,333
Sure. Good afternoon.

352
00:34:28,467 --> 00:34:30,834
Wait. Let me check the back.

353
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,166
Damn it.

354
00:34:35,233 --> 00:34:36,266
{\an8}Thank you.

355
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:43,900
It's the Locust Swarm!

356
00:34:43,967 --> 00:34:46,433
Hey! Get out. Stop!

357
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,100
Hey! Stop the car.

358
00:34:49,967 --> 00:34:50,800
Oh, no.

359
00:34:51,567 --> 00:34:52,967
Hey!

360
00:34:53,033 --> 00:34:54,533
-Give me the keys.
-What is it?

361
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,767
Who are they?

362
00:34:55,834 --> 00:34:56,834
Goodness.

363
00:35:07,166 --> 00:35:08,200
Jin.

364
00:35:19,567 --> 00:35:20,567
The victims...

365
00:35:28,734 --> 00:35:30,667
<i>They were all there at the scene.</i>

366
00:36:19,233 --> 00:36:20,233
Captain.

367
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,233
SON

368
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,834
No. Ha Ma-ri.

369
00:36:23,667 --> 00:36:24,500
Oh, forget it.

370
00:36:24,567 --> 00:36:25,467
SON

371
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,333
Yes, Father?

372
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,467
What? The Locust Swarm?

373
00:36:36,967 --> 00:36:37,800
I'm on my way.

374
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,233
-Excuse me.
-What are you doing?

375
00:37:00,533 --> 00:37:02,867
Damn it. What do we do now?

376
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,667
Should we lose him when the lights change?

377
00:37:05,734 --> 00:37:08,000
Yes. Step on it
when it's the yellow light.

378
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,834
Then we'll get out of the car
and get Boss out.

379
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:11,800
Then we'll run.

380
00:37:27,233 --> 00:37:30,400
What's wrong? Pull yourself together!

381
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,900
What's going on here?

382
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,934
Hey, bastard. Kim Hyeong-su.

383
00:37:43,433 --> 00:37:44,633
How do I work this?

384
00:37:54,533 --> 00:37:55,633
Kim Hyeong-su.

385
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:56,834
Hyeong-su.

386
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,133
Hyeong-su!

387
00:38:15,767 --> 00:38:17,934
Those bastards are bold.

388
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,500
All right.

389
00:38:26,667 --> 00:38:28,700
I can't help it. I'm going to do this.

390
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,533
What?

391
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,433
When I was on the Violent Crimes Team,

392
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,166
I was second to none.

393
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:48,367
Goodness!

394
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,767
Oh, Lord.

395
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,767
If you want to live, run!

396
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,266
Stop right there!

397
00:39:11,367 --> 00:39:12,200
Stop!

398
00:39:14,066 --> 00:39:15,000
Stop right now!

399
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,967
Stop, you bastards!

400
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:22,233
Those bastards.

401
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,400
Hey!

402
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,834
Stop...

403
00:39:30,467 --> 00:39:31,467
Stop...

404
00:39:41,133 --> 00:39:42,000
Damn it.

405
00:39:42,667 --> 00:39:43,800
I'll shoot if you move.

406
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:53,633
-I must be getting old.
-Goodness, Father.

407
00:39:54,967 --> 00:39:56,433
Come on, guys.

408
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:59,533
I love this. I feel protected.

409
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,734
Son. I can't believe
we caught the Locust Swarm.

410
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:09,367
Why were they at the mental hospital?

411
00:40:09,433 --> 00:40:10,266
Well...

412
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,367
Turn the car around!

413
00:40:21,467 --> 00:40:22,300
{\an8}What?

414
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:21,033
<i>This train is for Sinorim.</i>

415
00:41:32,734 --> 00:41:35,000
<i>The train is now approaching.</i>

416
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,633
Sae-rom!

417
00:42:01,567 --> 00:42:08,567
I'M THE VICTIM

418
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,934
<i>I'm the victim.</i>

419
00:42:33,667 --> 00:42:34,500
Mi-hyeon.

420
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:38,934
Mi-hyeon.

421
00:42:40,166 --> 00:42:41,433
That day...

422
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:44,000
When I left Jin with you
because I had an interview...

423
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,233
Nothing happened that day, right?

424
00:42:58,066 --> 00:43:00,200
I'll be right back,

425
00:43:00,266 --> 00:43:03,667
so stay here and wait for me, okay?

426
00:43:03,734 --> 00:43:04,867
I'll be right back.

427
00:43:14,533 --> 00:43:16,100
Hey. What are you doing?

428
00:43:22,734 --> 00:43:24,433
-I think someone's dead.
-Oh, no.

429
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:25,700
-I can see the body.
-Oh, no.

430
00:43:25,767 --> 00:43:27,300
She looks like a young girl.

431
00:43:27,367 --> 00:43:29,266
-What happened? When did it happen?
-It's a young girl.

432
00:43:29,333 --> 00:43:31,533
-I don't know.
-Jin.

433
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,000
Jin!

434
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:49,834
Jin.

435
00:43:58,066 --> 00:43:59,667
I'm sorry, Ryeong.

436
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:06,934
I was so scared
that I couldn't say anything.

437
00:44:51,867 --> 00:44:55,133
Tell me what's going on.

438
00:44:59,433 --> 00:45:00,333
Rookie.

439
00:45:05,967 --> 00:45:07,266
Sae-rom's died...

440
00:45:12,934 --> 00:45:14,367
because of Jin.

441
00:45:17,767 --> 00:45:19,834
Kim Cheol-jin pushed Jin,

442
00:45:21,333 --> 00:45:24,100
and as she fell, she grabbed Sae-rom.

443
00:45:26,367 --> 00:45:27,633
In the end...

444
00:45:30,934 --> 00:45:32,200
Sae-rom fell onto the tracks.

445
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,467
{\an8}APRIL 5TH
I-JUN'S RELEASE DATE FROM PRISON

446
00:46:21,734 --> 00:46:23,633
<i>I don't ever want to see you again...</i>

447
00:46:25,834 --> 00:46:26,667
<i>Mom.</i>

448
00:46:28,834 --> 00:46:31,433
<i>He would go to the place
where Sae-rom died first, right?</i>

449
00:46:41,033 --> 00:46:45,266
<i>This train is for Sinorim.</i>

450
00:46:49,967 --> 00:46:52,300
<i>The doors are opening.</i>

451
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:36,266
PERSONNEL ONLY
DRIVERS' ROOM

452
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:39,633
POLICE

453
00:49:32,333 --> 00:49:35,734
Excuse me. I lost my sister.

454
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:38,033
She looks just like me. Have you seen her?

455
00:49:39,834 --> 00:49:42,200
No, I haven't.

456
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:45,000
Thank you.

457
00:49:47,033 --> 00:49:48,066
Jin.

458
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:50,467
Jin.

459
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,300
Jin.

460
00:50:37,867 --> 00:50:38,800
Sae-rom.

461
00:50:41,166 --> 00:50:42,567
I punished her instead.

462
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:46,367
She was walking around freely
after killing you.

463
00:50:47,633 --> 00:50:49,433
There was no intention of murder?

464
00:50:51,133 --> 00:50:53,300
I'm living in hell.

465
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:57,633
I'm going to punish them all.

466
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:00,533
That crazy homeless bastard

467
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:04,700
and everyone who just stood there
and watched him.

468
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:25,734
{\an8}SCREEN DOOR
ONLY FOR EMERGENCY

469
00:53:37,033 --> 00:53:37,900
This...

470
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:41,433
I'll be sure to give it back.

471
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,033
Hey.

472
00:55:00,333 --> 00:55:01,233
Hey.

473
00:55:16,734 --> 00:55:17,734
Sae-rom.

474
00:55:19,633 --> 00:55:20,600
Sae-rom.

475
00:55:22,767 --> 00:55:24,867
Sae-rom!

476
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:29,500
Sae-rom.

477
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,934
<i>I still have one thing left to do.</i>

478
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:45,700
Grandma will protect you, Sae-rom.

479
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:47,934
Don't worry.

480
00:55:49,233 --> 00:55:50,467
That will...

481
00:55:51,066 --> 00:55:54,133
That will never happen again.

482
00:55:57,433 --> 00:56:02,000
I'm going to withdraw some money
and be back soon.

483
00:56:02,066 --> 00:56:04,333
Don't open the door for anyone.

484
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:05,400
Okay?

485
00:56:06,333 --> 00:56:07,166
Okay.

486
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:34,934
-It's this house.
-Let's go.

487
00:56:43,266 --> 00:56:44,266
It's the police.

488
00:56:49,033 --> 00:56:49,934
Ma'am!

489
00:56:53,934 --> 00:56:54,967
Is anyone home?

490
00:56:57,166 --> 00:56:58,300
It's the police!

491
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:05,834
It's the police.

492
00:57:08,467 --> 00:57:09,767
Is anyone home?

493
00:57:12,667 --> 00:57:13,700
It's the police!

494
00:57:20,734 --> 00:57:22,567
I know you're in there!

495
00:57:24,066 --> 00:57:26,100
If you don't open the door,
we'll break it open.

496
00:57:28,667 --> 00:57:29,700
Ryeong.

497
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:35,333
Ms. Choi Gyeong-hui.

498
00:57:35,967 --> 00:57:36,934
Ryeong.

499
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:42,667
Ms. Choi Gyeong-hui.

500
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:12,900
CATCH THE GHOST

501
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:16,834
{\an8}<i>She remembers me letting go of her hand.</i>

502
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:18,667
{\an8}<i>What if she doesn't forgive me?</i>

503
00:58:18,734 --> 00:58:19,767
Ryeong.

504
00:58:20,033 --> 00:58:21,533
<i>Tell her it was a misunderstanding</i>

505
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:23,767
and that you've been
looking for her all this time.

506
00:58:24,767 --> 00:58:26,533
<i>He'll abandon the body
in the subway this time too</i>

507
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:28,000
<i>in order to complete his message.</i>

508
00:58:28,467 --> 00:58:30,333
<i>The first train that is still empty.</i>

509
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,166
<i>That will be his only chance.</i>

510
00:58:33,166 --> 00:58:38,000
<i>The person I-jun's planning to kill
before killing himself is Jin.</i>

511
00:58:39,166 --> 00:58:40,333
No!
