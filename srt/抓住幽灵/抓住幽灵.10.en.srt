00:01:35,384 --> 00:01:37,229
Open the door. We're the police.

9
00:01:48,434 --> 00:01:50,578
What is it?

10
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:53,309
I thought this was the maintenance room.

11
00:01:53,374 --> 00:01:57,104
It was turned into the
cleaning staff lounge.

12
00:01:57,104 --> 00:01:59,274
Where was the maintenance room moved to?

13
00:01:59,274 --> 00:02:02,518
On the other side. Next to the turnstiles.

14
00:02:24,903 --> 00:02:27,149
No. Choi Mi Ra.

15
00:02:29,104 --> 00:02:30,318
Ms. Choi Mi Ra.

16
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:38,083
She's breathing.

17
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:40,183
We're in the maintenance room in
the basement of Munseong Station.

18
00:02:40,183 --> 00:02:41,489
Send an ambulance.

19
00:02:44,484 --> 00:02:46,993
Ma Ri, it's Munseong Station.
We need backup.

20
00:02:46,993 --> 00:02:48,198
Hurry.

21
00:02:50,824 --> 00:02:53,739
Ms. Choi Mi Ra.

22
00:03:16,354 --> 00:03:17,959
What if he exited the station?

23
00:03:18,354 --> 00:03:20,098
No, there are too many cameras outside.

24
00:03:20,794 --> 00:03:22,493
This is the last train of the day.

25
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:23,598
The last train.

26
00:03:24,363 --> 00:03:26,209
Please make your way...

27
00:03:40,173 --> 00:03:41,389
No.

28
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:55,493
When we found her, she was barely conscious.
We stopped the bleeding,

29
00:03:55,493 --> 00:03:57,339
but her pulse was weak.

30
00:03:57,963 --> 00:04:01,008

Don't die.

36
00:04:49,284 --> 00:04:50,758
You are...

37
00:04:50,914 --> 00:04:53,588
the only one who knows his face.

38
00:04:54,284 --> 00:04:56,458
Five people died already.

39
00:04:58,584 --> 00:04:59,969
You can't die...

40
00:05:02,464 --> 00:05:04,498
so irresponsibly.

41
00:05:16,173 --> 00:05:18,748
She always takes everything on herself.

42
00:05:19,673 --> 00:05:22,258
She doesn't realize it's wearing her down.

43
00:05:25,084 --> 00:05:26,854
(Seoun Metropolitan Police Agency)

44
00:05:26,854 --> 00:05:30,024
You had the Subway Ghost but you lost him?

45
00:05:30,024 --> 00:05:32,898
Can't you do anything right?

46
00:05:33,594 --> 00:05:35,799
This time, it ended as
only an attempted murder.

47
00:05:36,063 --> 00:05:40,063
If the victim wakes up,
we can get information on the killer.

48
00:05:40,063 --> 00:05:41,263
What about the media?

49
00:05:41,263 --> 00:05:43,309
I think the reporters caught on.

50
00:05:43,633 --> 00:05:46,433
We're saying it is unrelated to
the Subway Serial Murders, but...

51
00:05:46,433 --> 00:05:49,203
If that makes it on the news,
forget the three months.

52
00:05:49,204 --> 00:05:52,673
The press will stomp on us and kill us.
You know that, right?

53
00:05:52,673 --> 00:05:54,612
We finally took one step forward.

54
00:05:54,613 --> 00:05:57,188
It'll all be over before we
can investigate anything!

55
00:05:57,484 --> 00:05:59,854
Make sure to stop the
story from getting out!

56
00:05:59,854 --> 00:06:00,914
Yes, ma'am.

57
00:06:00,914 --> 00:06:03,229
If you can't find lead even after this,

58
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:06,099
you're unqualified to be a
lieutenant of the Metro Division.

59
00:06:11,464 --> 00:06:12,909
How's Choi Mi Ra?

60
00:06:13,094 --> 00:06:14,768
She's still unconscious.

61
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:18,803
Did you get the analysis results
of the coins from the payphone?

62
00:06:18,803 --> 00:06:19,878
Yes.

63
00:06:23,104 --> 00:06:25,203
There were 22 coins in the coin box.

64
00:06:25,204 --> 00:06:27,349
There were five fingerprints on them.

65
00:06:27,714 --> 00:06:30,659
All but one have been identified,

66
00:06:31,243 --> 00:06:34,359
and all four of those
people have been cleared.

67
00:06:35,084 --> 00:06:37,458
Then find that last person.

68
00:06:38,834 --> 00:06:41,948
It's a partial print,
so it's hard to search the database.

69
00:06:42,313 --> 00:06:45,089
They say they can do a partial
comparison against a sample.

70
00:06:46,584 --> 00:06:49,954
This has the best angle and clarity.

71
00:06:49,954 --> 00:06:51,959
Let's make the wanted posters with this.

72
00:06:52,384 --> 00:06:55,223
How many should we print? 1,000? 2,000?

73
00:06:55,223 --> 00:06:58,068
Let's see. If we want to put
them all over all the stations...

74
00:07:00,123 --> 00:07:01,238
Newbie.

75
00:07:02,634 --> 00:07:04,808
She's completely checked out this morning.

76
00:07:05,534 --> 00:07:07,539
Newbie. Go wash your face.

77
00:07:09,433 --> 00:07:10,878
I'm fine.

78
00:07:16,473 --> 00:07:18,048
Hello, Detective Kim.

79
00:07:20,113 --> 00:07:22,888
I'll be right back.

80
00:07:27,284 --> 00:07:28,459
Just a moment.

81
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:39,979
Yes.

82
00:07:42,834 --> 00:07:44,678
Tonight is good.

83
00:07:44,834 --> 00:07:46,019
Tonight?

84
00:07:47,243 --> 00:07:49,188
What's "good"?

85
00:08:11,594 --> 00:08:14,508
Yes. Tonight is good.

86
00:08:53,843 --> 00:08:54,918
(Check! Remove lock before activating)

87
00:09:12,693 --> 00:09:13,898
Let's go.

88
00:09:24,404 --> 00:09:25,878
No.

89
00:09:26,244 --> 00:09:29,918
She wouldn't get up at
this hour to meet a guy.

90
00:09:31,313 --> 00:09:34,158
No. No way.

91
00:09:34,913 --> 00:09:36,459
Newbie wouldn't do that.

92
00:09:48,864 --> 00:09:49,969
(Restricted Area)

93
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,199
(Restricted Area)

94
00:10:41,884 --> 00:10:43,729
There's a platform.

95
00:11:23,423 --> 00:11:24,528
Officer Yoo,

96
00:11:25,323 --> 00:11:26,398
come look at this.

97
00:12:01,124 --> 00:12:04,809
(Choi Mi Ra)

98
00:12:05,663 --> 00:12:06,839
"Choi Mi Ra"?

99
00:12:13,974 --> 00:12:15,573
(Park Ji Yun)

100
00:12:15,573 --> 00:12:16,689
"Park Ji Yun".

101
00:12:20,484 --> 00:12:21,658
"Hwang Soo Young".

102
00:12:23,683 --> 00:12:24,829
"Choi Jin Kang".

103
00:12:28,224 --> 00:12:29,359
"Kim Min Jae".

104
00:12:30,323 --> 00:12:32,839
This is his hideout.

105
00:12:44,034 --> 00:12:46,378
What about my sister?
What about Jin's wallet?

106
00:12:47,173 --> 00:12:48,449
There aren't any more wallets.

107
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:57,189
Jin...

108
00:12:57,913 --> 00:12:59,258
What about Jin?

109
00:12:59,884 --> 00:13:01,559
It means she could be alive.

110
00:13:01,953 --> 00:13:04,998
Where could Jin be?

111
00:13:34,484 --> 00:13:36,998
I bet he hides here until
the lights turn off at night.

112
00:13:37,823 --> 00:13:40,339
Then he would climb up that way
to Wangsoori Station's platform.

113
00:13:41,693 --> 00:13:45,138
That's how he avoided the cameras
on the platform and the turnstiles.

114
00:13:46,604 --> 00:13:48,278
He used the tunnel to get in and out?

115
00:13:49,364 --> 00:13:50,648
I had my doubts,

116
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:53,648
but you were right.

117
00:14:01,183 --> 00:14:03,689
But why are there so
many wallets and phones?

118
00:14:03,754 --> 00:14:05,059
I think he stole them first,

119
00:14:05,953 --> 00:14:08,299
then chose the targets from these.

120
00:14:10,894 --> 00:14:12,939
He stole so many.

121
00:14:13,823 --> 00:14:15,138
The Subway Ghost...

122
00:14:16,693 --> 00:14:17,868
was a pickpocket.

123
00:14:26,573 --> 00:14:28,648
(Restricted Area)

124
00:14:48,923 --> 00:14:51,538
Why is there a girl's dress?

125
00:15:05,644 --> 00:15:08,144
The piece of cloth I picked
up from the tunnel...

126
00:15:08,144 --> 00:15:09,888
was a piece torn from this dress.

127
00:15:11,354 --> 00:15:13,528
It seems to be precious to him.

128
00:15:14,953 --> 00:15:16,998
I doubt he dropped it by accident.

129
00:15:17,043 --> 00:15:18,318
He put it there on purpose,

130
00:15:19,143 --> 00:15:20,448
hoping I'd pick it up.

131
00:15:21,643 --> 00:15:23,059
The day I picked up this cloth,

132
00:15:24,013 --> 00:15:25,659
he attacked me.

133
00:15:28,113 --> 00:15:29,929
He stepped back just before killing me.

134
00:15:31,224 --> 00:15:33,029
He placed this piece of cloth in the tunnel.

135
00:15:35,924 --> 00:15:37,992
I think the reason why he didn't kill me...

136
00:15:37,993 --> 00:15:39,608
might have to do with this cloth.

137
00:15:39,734 --> 00:15:41,934
If he has something to say to
you, and that's why...

138
00:15:41,934 --> 00:15:44,238
he didn't kill you and
dropped this on purpose,

139
00:15:45,363 --> 00:15:48,509
his message must be in this clothing.

140
00:15:53,043 --> 00:15:55,588
We have one hour left.
Let's search the platform first.

141
00:16:35,314 --> 00:16:36,458
Jin?

142
00:16:40,153 --> 00:16:41,269
Yoo Jin.

143
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,424
The receiver cannot be reached.

144
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,535
There's no way...

145
00:18:55,329 --> 00:18:57,074
she'd go out without taking this.

146
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:05,185
Let's call Forensics right away.

147
00:19:08,579 --> 00:19:09,755
No.

148
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,124
Newbie!

149
00:19:18,819 --> 00:19:19,965
Newbie!

150
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:22,265
Newbie...

151
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,205
Newbie!

152
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:28,035
New...

153
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:55,935
You mean...

154
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:00,074
notifying everyone right now would
put Ji Seok in trouble, right?

155
00:20:01,259 --> 00:20:03,644
He's the one who is responsible...

156
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:06,545
for the screen door key.

157
00:20:09,239 --> 00:20:10,985
Once trains start running,

158
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:14,015
no one can approach that area.

159
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,525
Please have Metro Detective
Division search the area,

160
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:21,995
and act as if your team was
the first to discover it.

161
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,725
I'll do that.

162
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:50,424
Where is the screen door key?

163
00:20:52,049 --> 00:20:53,255
Well...

164
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:59,124
Let's go home for today.
We'll search for it tomorrow.

165
00:21:02,989 --> 00:21:04,634
No...

166
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,235
Chief.

167
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:23,025
Newbie.

168
00:21:26,349 --> 00:21:27,725
Woo Hyuk.

169
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,324
Ji Seok.

170
00:21:31,489 --> 00:21:33,094
Let me explain.

171
00:21:41,499 --> 00:21:44,305
I want you to explain. What happened?

172
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:48,644
Why are you...

173
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:51,445
in the tunnel?

174
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,154
No...

175
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,384
Since when did you start...

176
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,995
going in the tunnel without telling me?

177
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:08,035
I said, when did you start?

178
00:22:11,329 --> 00:22:13,705
I asked you. Since when?

179
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:24,245
Since when...

180
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:27,755
were you pretending?

181
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,455
Was it from the beginning?

182
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:36,695
No, right?

183
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,495
You wouldn't do that to me.

184
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,634
Right?

185
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,265
Officer Yoo.

186
00:23:34,309 --> 00:23:35,755
Just tell him.

187
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:39,785
He'd understand if you tell
him you did it for your sister.

188
00:24:08,579 --> 00:24:10,849
Didn't you go home?

189
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:12,685
Did you have fun with Ryung?

190
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:14,579
I'm sorry?

191
00:24:14,579 --> 00:24:16,455
I'm talking about
investigating behind my back.

192
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,225
I heard you talking on the phone yesterday.

193
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,364
I doubted myself when I did.

194
00:24:22,289 --> 00:24:24,334
If there's a team you want to go
to, tell me.

195
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,190
I'm sorry.

196
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:27,435
I don't want to hear it.

197
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:29,235
Pack your stuff right away.

198
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:32,705
The criminal was really using the tunnel.

199
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:41,185
We found his hideout...

200
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:43,354
in Wangsoori Station's tunnel.

201
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,225
There were pictures of the victims
he took without their permission,

202
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,965
as well as the victims' belongings.

203
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:52,725
Who else knows...

204
00:24:53,789 --> 00:24:55,289
there is such a place?

205
00:24:55,289 --> 00:24:57,035
Just Ryung and me.

206
00:24:57,989 --> 00:25:00,235
You're the first one I'm reporting this to.

207
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:03,275
But, please don't tell anyone
that we found this out today.

208
00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:05,245
If people find out,

209
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:07,975
it'll put Ji Seok in trouble.

210
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,545
That's why I plan on contacting
the Subway Corporation today...

211
00:25:11,569 --> 00:25:13,939
to request an official investigation.

212
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:17,185
We can make it look like Metro
Detective Division found it first.

213
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,384
This is Officer Yoo's idea, isn't it?

214
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,880
Yes.

215
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,824
Why does she have her chin up so high?

216
00:25:24,049 --> 00:25:26,124
Who does she think she is?

217
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:28,564
How could she just give such a thing to us?

218
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:33,705
I spent two full years
giving my all on this case.

219
00:25:34,059 --> 00:25:35,660
If she just hands it over
to me like it's nothing,

220
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,945
what does that make me?

221
00:25:37,069 --> 00:25:39,074
Well, what?

222
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,179
Request the Subway
Corporation for cooperation...

223
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,785
so I can go in there tonight.

00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:35,435
She has level two autism.

232
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:38,935
I'm begging you.

233
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:42,700
Please look it over as a
Subway Serial Murder case.

234
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:45,005
Please help me...

235
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,079
What is all this?

236
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:03,788
Does this mean we've been sleeping
underground with closed shutters...

237
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:05,864
with the Subway Ghost this whole time?

238
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,989
Dad, I'm scared.

239
00:27:07,989 --> 00:27:09,695
Be a man and don't be scared.

240
00:27:10,089 --> 00:27:12,730
Then the first victim isn't Park Ji Yun.

241
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:14,435
It's the woman in that picture, right?

242
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:19,475
Where did the jerk hide the body?

243
00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:22,640
Is there another victim?

244
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,715
Are you here to watch? Go back upstairs.

245
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:27,584
This isn't a show.

246
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,114

00:27:29,339 --> 00:27:32,354
This is our turf.
Why are they acting like the boss?

248
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,854
- Wait.
- Yes?

249
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:48,904
These items were precious enough
for him to put into this crate.

250
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,199
Why do you think he left
it at the crime scene?

251
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,314
To look at whenever his drive to kill...

252
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,084
got weak.

253
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:58,945

Please stop, honey.

261
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:49,935
There was really a
hideout inside the tunnel?

262
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,235
What kind of person could he be?

263
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:56,005
By the way,

264
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,705
how did you find out?

265
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:03,068
We received an anonymous report...

266
00:29:03,069 --> 00:29:04,685
that there's something in the tunnel.

267
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:08,985
But, we have one more victim now.

268
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:11,680
What? Was there a body there?

269
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,078
No, there was a picture...

270
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:16,455
beside the other victims who were killed.

271
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,824
We haven't found the body,

272
00:29:18,989 --> 00:29:21,664
but it's likely she was
murdered by the perp.

273
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:23,488
Who is she?

274
00:29:23,489 --> 00:29:26,205
A woman with autism in her 20s.

275
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:28,935
She's been missing for about two years.

276
00:29:28,999 --> 00:29:30,134
Also,

277
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:34,745
her sister is an officer whom you also know.

278
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,144
Who?

279
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:38,844
Officer Yoo Ryung.

280
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:42,354
The bright officer with the Subway Police?

281
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:45,654
Yes.

282
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:49,650
How could she work so
hard and not show it...

283
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:52,525
when something so tragic happened to her?

284
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,319
That's why...

285
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:57,929
I'd like to recruit her into
our team on a temporary basis.

286
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:59,759
Don't you know an officer is excluded...

287
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:01,730
from investigating a case
if the victim is a relative?

288
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:02,904
Of course, I do.

289
00:30:02,999 --> 00:30:04,829
Why do you need her so badly,

290
00:30:04,829 --> 00:30:06,374
that you'd break protocol?

291
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:08,745
- It's not that I need her...
- Lieutenant Ha.

292
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:12,945
I meant it as a humanitarian act.

293
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:15,079
Now that we all know it's
connected to this case,

294
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:17,485
she'd probably be interested.

295
00:30:18,809 --> 00:30:20,424
I don't need her.

296
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:25,624
Okay.

297
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:27,995
You did great the past two years.

298
00:30:29,789 --> 00:30:31,864
Mom's very proud of you.

299
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,914
What do you want to have for dinner?

300
00:30:42,039 --> 00:30:43,884
I'll make the reservation.

301
00:30:46,739 --> 00:30:48,914
Read the room before you make a joke.

302
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,084
What?

303
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,594
Okay.

304
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:01,265
The other victim we found out about
after going into the tunnel...

305
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,205
Why didn't he put her body under a seat?

306
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:07,799
Hey. He was probably not as good
at it since it was his first time.

307
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:11,904
It's not easy to do that under a seat.

308
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:13,715
She may not have died.

309
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:16,140
Major Crimes is investigating it secretly,

310
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,545
be careful about letting it get out.

311
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,685
Lieutenant Ha will flip...

312
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:27,455
- Ma Ri.
- Officer Yoo,

313
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,324
come with me.

314
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,015
Officer Yoo,

315
00:31:48,739 --> 00:31:50,614
report to our office starting tomorrow.

316
00:31:51,339 --> 00:31:52,745
- Sorry?
- What?

317
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,555
You don't want to?

318
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:56,884
Isn't this what you wanted?

319
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:59,555
Catching the Subway Ghost yourself?

320
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:05,924
I guess you're scared,
now that I'm giving you the opportunity.

321
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,064
Forget it.

322
00:32:10,789 --> 00:32:11,965
I'll go...

323
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:14,634
to Metro.

324
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,814
Officer Yoo will report to
Metro starting tomorrow.

325
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:24,970
What?

326
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:26,009
- Metro?
- Metro?

327
00:32:26,009 --> 00:32:27,839
She'll be providing support indefinitely.

328
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:29,015
What...

329
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:31,854
are you guys doing behind my back?

330
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,924
Ask your partner that.

331
00:32:34,749 --> 00:32:36,594
She stabbed me in the back too.

332
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:51,805
We found...

333
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,975
the Subway Ghost's hideout in the tunnel.

334
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,614
As you know,

335
00:32:59,009 --> 00:33:00,985
I was interested in that case,

336
00:33:01,809 --> 00:33:04,685
and I had been investigating it on my own.

337
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:09,594
If that can help Metro's
investigation in any way at all,

338
00:33:12,849 --> 00:33:14,065
I'd like to go.

339
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,634
I asked during your interview...

340
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:26,105
why you wanted to join the
Subway Police so badly.

341
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,145
You talked about loving the subway
but never gave me the real reason.

342
00:33:30,909 --> 00:33:32,685
I asked several times since,

343
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:34,384
but as always,

344
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,355
you never gave me an answer.

345
00:33:39,349 --> 00:33:40,555
Why did you...

346
00:33:42,679 --> 00:33:43,864
join the Subway Police?

347
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:46,725
You stole the key as soon as you joined,

348
00:33:47,289 --> 00:33:49,019
and went into the tunnel without telling me.

349
00:33:49,019 --> 00:33:51,265
Now that you found something,
you want to join Metro.

350
00:33:54,329 --> 00:33:56,404
How am I supposed to take his?

351
00:34:00,099 --> 00:34:01,344
The title of being in Metro?

352
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:04,944
Was that really it?

353
00:34:15,849 --> 00:34:17,665
What is this all about?

354
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:21,765
(Subway Police)

355
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,404
I told you to go.

356
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,599
After the first case,

357
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:33,774
I said we don't mesh and told you to go.

358
00:34:33,999 --> 00:34:35,400
When you caught me trying
to borrow from a loan shark,

359
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,800
I told you to leave
because I was humiliated.

360
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,510
When you lied to me that
a Grasshopper was there...

361
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:40,444
and took me to that MMA fighter's house,

362
00:34:40,809 --> 00:34:43,214
I told you to go because I was furious!

363
00:34:43,309 --> 00:34:44,884
When you said you wanted
to go save Jung Hoon...

364
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,294
when I had to catch the Grasshoppers,

365
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:49,654
I said to go because I looked like a loser.

366
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:53,065
You stayed with me after seeing how
pathetic and what a loser I was,

367
00:34:53,349 --> 00:34:54,535
so maybe I misunderstood...

368
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,475
But all of that...

369
00:35:03,659 --> 00:35:04,904
was to join Metro?

370
00:35:08,499 --> 00:35:09,714
Is that all?

371
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:14,154
Was that really all it was?

372
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:17,884
I think...

373
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:24,765
that was all.

374
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:29,935
I'm sorry.

375
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:48,880
(Subway Police)

376
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:53,585
(Metropolitan Detective Division)

377
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:10,105
Ryung.

378
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:13,245
I mean, Officer Yoo.

379
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:26,355
(First Victim, Yoo Jin)

380
00:36:33,249 --> 00:36:35,364
She's here to help with
the Subway Serial Murders.

381
00:36:35,659 --> 00:36:36,895
Officer Yoo Ryung.

382
00:36:38,289 --> 00:36:40,464
I'm also the family of the first victim.

383
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:43,435
I heard you found that jerk's hideout.

384
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:44,875
Not bad.

385
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:46,745
How did you know he was in the tunnel?

386
00:36:50,969 --> 00:36:54,415
This is the evidence that made
me sure he used the tunnel.

387
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:56,714
For two years,

388
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,185
I investigated it alone.

389
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:01,424
Let's see.

390
00:37:02,179 --> 00:37:04,225
Talk about dedication.

391
00:37:04,449 --> 00:37:07,594
You should've shared this with us sooner.

392
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:09,464
I wanted to share them.

393
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,535
Desperately.

394
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:20,815
Woo Hyuk. Bring me the Yoo Jin case file.

395
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,745
- Sorry?
- Right now!

396
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,944
Yes, ma'am.

397
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:32,154
Read aloud...

398
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:35,719
Yoo Ryung's statement about how
she was separated from Yoo Jin...

399
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:36,855
when she went missing.

400
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,234
"I was on my way home with my sister..."

401
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:47,960
"and lost my sister in the crowd."

402
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,875
She lost her sister.

403
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:54,214
When you investigate a case,

404
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,315
there's a moment when a victim
looks like the perpetrator.

405
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:01,955
The moment the victim lies.

406
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:07,555
Just like when you said
you "lost" your sister.

407
00:38:17,789 --> 00:38:19,464
You left your disabled sister,

408
00:38:20,659 --> 00:38:22,730
but you cried and begged,

409
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:24,375
saying it was murder.

410
00:38:25,269 --> 00:38:28,114
How could I not see that as a total lie?

411
00:38:28,369 --> 00:38:29,475
Ryung.

412
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:32,745
What is this?

413
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:36,185
I didn't ignore your request to
investigate this from the start.

414
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:39,424
I looked into it and found this.

415
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,955
You looked like you went crazy
after abandoning your sister,

416
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,895
so I held back and didn't share this video.

417
00:38:50,059 --> 00:38:53,205
You're the one who made me ignore this case,

418
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,305
and you're the one who
caused your sister to die.

419
00:38:57,999 --> 00:38:59,805
It's all your doing.

420
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:04,269
No matter how hard it is,
how can you abandon your family?

421
00:39:04,269 --> 00:39:06,868
Especially one who's disabled.
That's like a death sentence.

422
00:39:06,869 --> 00:39:07,980
This is an abandonment case.

423
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,955
That's not true. You didn't let go
because you wanted to abandon her.

424
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:13,125
There was another reason.

425
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:15,754
Tell them. They're getting the wrong idea.

426
00:39:19,349 --> 00:39:20,424
I...

427
00:39:27,929 --> 00:39:29,074
left her.

428
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:31,205
How dare she come here
after committing a crime?

429
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,475
People are the most frightening.

430
00:39:41,409 --> 00:39:44,855
(Metro Team 1)

431
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,605
Hey.

432
00:40:02,329 --> 00:40:03,634
Never mind.

433
00:40:13,809 --> 00:40:15,415
Let's recruit a new member.

434
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:19,380
Newbie is there only temporarily.
She'll come back...

435
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:22,855
She has a goal.
She'll survive there somehow.

436
00:40:22,949 --> 00:40:25,749
Otherwise, she'll find a
place suitable for her,

437
00:40:25,749 --> 00:40:27,634
like Major Crimes or elsewhere.

438
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,234
Post the recruiting notice.

439
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,535
Okay.

440
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:33,634
I'm going to NFS.

441
00:40:33,659 --> 00:40:36,335
I'm sure the analysis results are
out for the Grasshoppers' bag.

442
00:40:36,499 --> 00:40:40,274
We'll go pick up their wanted posters.

443
00:40:40,369 --> 00:40:41,475
Okay.

444
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,515
Woo Hyuk.

445
00:40:51,249 --> 00:40:52,585
Did you find something?

446
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:58,289
It's the day Choi Mi Ra was attacked.

447
00:40:58,289 --> 00:40:59,794
He was caught on camera.

448
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,030
You said he has a shoulder tic, right?

449
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:10,460
Yes. Officer Yoo said she
felt it when she was attacked,

450
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:12,669
and you said it was caught on
camera when you were followed.

451
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:13,875
Yes.

452
00:41:19,469 --> 00:41:23,355
We thought he may be the Subway
Ghost, but didn't have any proof.

453
00:41:24,039 --> 00:41:25,448
We know for sure now.

454
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:27,949
He attacked an officer and stopped,

455
00:41:27,949 --> 00:41:30,395
and left a piece of clothing in the tunnel.

456
00:41:31,349 --> 00:41:34,594
That means that piece of
clothing is a message.

457
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:38,265
Why did he leave that for us?

458
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:41,360
Because I found out his method...

459
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,305
Then he would've just killed you.

460
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,145
But trying to kill you and
stopping doesn't match up.

461
00:41:47,329 --> 00:41:49,574
Maybe he's hiding something else.

462
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:54,740
We'll get a hint from the
clothing once we get the analysis.

463
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:56,539
We'll need a detailed analysis,

464
00:41:56,539 --> 00:42:00,555
but looking at the screen
door, he's about 180cm tall.

465
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:04,078
See if any of the
pickpockets are that height.

466
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:05,194
Yes, ma'am.

467
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:14,134
There's a suspect.

468
00:42:14,659 --> 00:42:16,035
The Grasshoppers.

469
00:42:16,099 --> 00:42:18,570
All of them are above 180cm and fit.

470
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:20,369
They move through the tunnel too.

471
00:42:20,369 --> 00:42:21,574
Hold on.

472
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:24,915
The Grasshoppers were also there
at the 30-year anniversary event.

473
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:26,740
They're the reason we found the body.

474
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:29,740
They robbed everyone in order to
uncover the body dramatically?

475
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:32,424
They both began their
crime spree two years ago.

476
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:35,995
I think one of the Grasshoppers
is the Subway Ghost.

477
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:39,765
Do you have a sketch of the Grasshoppers?

478
00:42:40,119 --> 00:42:41,294
Yes.

479
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,535
Lieutenant.

480
00:42:49,059 --> 00:42:51,205
We got the analysis of the stolen goods...

481
00:42:51,269 --> 00:42:54,774
found in the hideout, and they found DNA.

482
00:42:57,710 --> 00:43:01,484
A common DNA was found on 23
cell phones and wallets...

483
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:04,079
that were stolen.

484
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:07,050
If the same DNA was found
on all those items means...

485
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:08,280
it's the thief's DNA.

486
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,249
And that thief is the Subway Ghost.

487
00:43:10,249 --> 00:43:13,294
If that DNA matches the DNA
of one of the Grasshoppers,

488
00:43:13,449 --> 00:43:14,590
it'll be conclusive evidence.

489
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:17,460
We obtained the Grasshoppers'
bag of stolen goods recently.

490
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:21,099
Our chief said we may find their DNA in it,

491
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:22,774
and sent it in for analysis.

492
00:43:25,869 --> 00:43:28,969
Ji Seok, did they finish
analyzing the Grasshoppers' bag?

493
00:43:28,969 --> 00:43:32,315
They just finished, but it's clean.
They found nothing.

494
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:34,415
Why do you ask?

495
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,710
I'll go to your office. Let's talk there.

496
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:39,754
Something bugs me though.

497
00:43:39,949 --> 00:43:41,055
What?

498
00:43:41,179 --> 00:43:42,449
The shoulder tic.

499
00:43:42,449 --> 00:43:44,364
None of the Grasshoppers have a tic.

500
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:46,920
That's not something you can control.

501
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:50,265
It may only manifest when
he feels the desire to kill.

502
00:43:50,289 --> 00:43:52,705
It may be brought on by extreme excitement.

503
00:43:52,829 --> 00:43:55,559
Or he may have dissociative
identity disorder.

504
00:43:55,559 --> 00:43:56,829
(Dissociative Identity Disorder:
multiple personality disorder)

505
00:43:56,829 --> 00:44:00,004
When the other identity takes over,
their thoughts and actions change.

506
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:04,415
Do you still feel sick?

507
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:08,415
Yes. My gastritis just won't get better.

508
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:14,024
What about Vietnam?

509
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,150
What? Let's go have some pho.

510
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:17,579
Why? I don't like noodles.

511
00:44:17,579 --> 00:44:18,849
It's better than going to jail.

512
00:44:18,849 --> 00:44:20,749
I don't want to go.

513
00:44:20,749 --> 00:44:22,159
Something good may happen if we go.

514
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:24,294
- What?
- If we're lucky,

515
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,074
we may get on Interpol's wanted list.

516
00:44:28,159 --> 00:44:30,360
Pickpockets that Interpol is after.

517
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:34,574
That's much cooler than being
the most trending search term.

518
00:44:38,539 --> 00:44:41,754
Who cares if there's no DNA?

519
00:44:44,179 --> 00:44:45,884
We have this.

520
00:44:46,579 --> 00:44:48,019
My pretty things.

521
00:44:48,019 --> 00:44:50,895
They were such a pain in the neck.
Will they be useful now?

522
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:54,119
- Useful?
- Your punishment...

523
00:44:54,119 --> 00:44:56,395
is deferred right now.

524
00:44:56,659 --> 00:44:58,205
If you catch them,

525
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:02,159
they'll cancel your punishment right away.

526
00:45:02,159 --> 00:45:03,335
That's right.

527
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:13,909
We'll catch the Grasshoppers now.

528
00:45:13,909 --> 00:45:15,185
What?

529
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,515
Hey.

530
00:45:17,749 --> 00:45:19,349
Why are you taking our Grasshoppers?

531
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:22,824
One of the Grasshoppers is the Subway Ghost.

532
00:45:23,449 --> 00:45:24,995
What?

533
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:32,130
It's not good to alert them,
so we'll keep the wanted posters as is.

534
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:33,289
Give me the original.

535
00:45:33,289 --> 00:45:35,234
What? Okay.

536
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:44,444
Later.

(Wanted Subway Pickpocket Suspects)

538
00:45:53,449 --> 00:45:56,424
Did something just happen?

539
00:45:56,949 --> 00:45:59,294
They suddenly showed up, took our babies,

540
00:45:59,849 --> 00:46:02,035
and said they were actually theirs.

541
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:04,389
What? Is that it?

542
00:46:04,389 --> 00:46:06,364
We chased them for two years.

key you took all the way home.

544
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:14,875
Sure.

545
00:46:16,499 --> 00:46:17,840
Sorry about that.

546
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,015
It's there.

547
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:24,315
Did you bring this from home?

548
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:26,225
Yes.

549
00:46:32,019 --> 00:46:33,495
Okay. Get back to work.

550
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,105
Why are they...

551
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:42,335
taking everything?

552
00:46:45,769 --> 00:46:49,674
Can you believe a serial
killer lived in the tunnel?

553
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,344
And at Wangsoori...

554
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:57,855
People will avoid this station
if they found out, right?

555
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:02,794
I need to stop by somewhere.

556
00:47:05,949 --> 00:47:07,065
So?

557
00:47:07,449 --> 00:47:10,090
Why is the head of security
of the Subway Corporation...

558
00:47:10,090 --> 00:47:12,535
Where did you get the tip
that the serial killer...

559
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:14,230
had his hideout in the tunnel?

560
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:15,329
It was an anonymous tip...

561
00:47:15,329 --> 00:47:18,004
I'm a smart man.

562
00:47:19,469 --> 00:47:20,705
What?

563
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:24,475
I can see what the police are up to.

564
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:28,785
I went to the Subway Police at
Wangsoori for the screen door key.

565
00:47:29,139 --> 00:47:32,449
Chief Ko Ji Seok couldn't give it to me.

566
00:47:32,449 --> 00:47:33,585
However,

567
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:36,694
right after the hideout was found,

568
00:47:37,349 --> 00:47:39,495
he gave me the screen door key.

569
00:47:40,389 --> 00:47:42,665
He couldn't give it to me before...

570
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:45,665
because...

571
00:47:46,159 --> 00:47:48,329
he needed to use it that night.

572
00:47:48,329 --> 00:47:50,030
So, what you're saying is,

573
00:47:50,030 --> 00:47:52,774
the police found it first...

574
00:47:52,929 --> 00:47:54,869
but lied about the tip...

575
00:47:54,869 --> 00:47:58,269
in order to cover up an
illegal investigation?

576
00:47:58,269 --> 00:47:59,844
Find out for yourself.

577
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:02,015
I'm sure there was no tip.

578
00:48:05,749 --> 00:48:07,650
After I figured out their method,

579
00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:10,050
I chased one down like
crazy in the tunnel...

580
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:11,719
But, we have one more victim now.

581
00:48:11,719 --> 00:48:14,935
Her sister is an officer. Officer Yoo Ryung.

582
00:48:19,389 --> 00:48:20,734
Okay.

583
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:24,375
I will check all the facts.

584
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:27,504
If what you say is true,

585
00:48:27,769 --> 00:48:31,844
I will hold the responsible
party accountable.

586
00:48:39,449 --> 00:48:40,949
Is something wrong?

587
00:48:40,949 --> 00:48:42,225
Wait.

588
00:48:42,949 --> 00:48:45,194
Your accomplice will be here soon.

589
00:48:45,449 --> 00:48:47,424
Accomplice?

590
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:05,384
How long have you been
going into the tunnel?

591
00:49:05,639 --> 00:49:06,915
Sorry?

592
00:49:08,539 --> 00:49:11,154
You even made up a fake tip.

593
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:14,820
You probably thought it was a perfect crime.

594
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:17,380
Madam Commissioner.
I'm the one that went in.

595
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:19,019
I did it all by myself.

596
00:49:19,019 --> 00:49:20,895
Ko Ji Seok. Tell me.

597
00:49:21,289 --> 00:49:23,835
When you brought me my wallet,

598
00:49:24,119 --> 00:49:26,864
you said a station worker
found it in the tunnel.

599
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:28,634
Was that true?

600
00:49:30,659 --> 00:49:32,745
I'm sorry. I had...

601
00:49:34,329 --> 00:49:35,915
gone in.

602
00:49:36,099 --> 00:49:37,444
Chief.

603
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:40,740
That was only because I went in first...

604
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:43,915
Why did you go into the
tunnel without permission?

605
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:48,125
I wanted to catch the Subway Ghost.

606
00:49:51,619 --> 00:49:55,864
Every officer in Korea
wants to catch the criminal.

607
00:49:56,119 --> 00:49:58,530
But, if they all went around
ignoring regulations...

608
00:49:58,530 --> 00:50:02,035
and deceiving others,
what would become of this organization?

609
00:50:03,030 --> 00:50:04,134
Especially you.

610
00:50:04,869 --> 00:50:06,774
You're a chief.

611
00:50:07,499 --> 00:50:10,214
It's your job to manage your subordinates!

612
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,415
If you didn't know what was going on,

613
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:15,285
it means you're a lousy chief!

614
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:18,484
It's all my fault.

615
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:21,125
The disciplinary committee got
together to have a discussion.

616
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:25,125
Everyone agrees we should
keep it confidential.

617
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:27,094
I'll tell you...

618
00:50:28,019 --> 00:50:29,694
what disciplinary action
we'll take against you.

619
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:35,375
Officer Yoo Ryung.

620
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:38,205
What you did was bad enough
to get you a suspension,

621
00:50:38,969 --> 00:50:41,745
but some thought that we should
take your performance into account.

622
00:50:42,699 --> 00:50:44,015
You'll get a wage
reduction for three months.

623
00:50:44,570 --> 00:50:45,685
Yes, ma'am.

624
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:48,285
Chief Inspector Ko Ji Seok.

625
00:50:49,639 --> 00:50:52,524
Since we were holding off on
taking disciplinary action,

626
00:50:53,449 --> 00:50:55,125
we decided to give you a harsher punishment.

627
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:58,024
You're suspended for three months.

628
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:01,535
A suspension?

629
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:04,134
- No, ma'am.
- Lieutenant Ko Ji Seok.

630
00:51:05,090 --> 00:51:08,335
Starting this minute,
back out from all cases.

631
00:51:16,199 --> 00:51:17,315
I'm sorry.

632
00:51:20,639 --> 00:51:21,785
It's okay.

633
00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:24,214
We won't be seeing each other anymore.

634
00:51:45,035 --> 00:51:47,504
Chief, you should file for an appeal.

635
00:51:47,504 --> 00:51:49,780
My mom's friend's son is a lawyer, so...

636
00:51:51,515 --> 00:51:52,590
Forget it.

637
00:51:53,214 --> 00:51:54,415
It's my responsibility.

638
00:51:54,415 --> 00:51:56,220
They'll reassign you once
your suspension ends.

639
00:51:57,415 --> 00:51:59,030
You won't be able to return here.

640
00:51:59,955 --> 00:52:01,289
I'll come back.

641
00:52:03,825 --> 00:52:05,495
Getting a suspension isn't a joke.

642
00:52:05,495 --> 00:52:07,430
Do you just have to accept
it if they give it to you?

643
00:52:07,794 --> 00:52:09,499
I won't be making any
money for three months.

644
00:52:09,794 --> 00:52:12,769

648
00:52:32,015 --> 00:52:33,090
Don't see me out.

649
00:52:33,415 --> 00:52:35,030

- What is it, Ae Shim?
- What?

- What is it?
- Gosh. Who are you?

I do. That punk beat her up.

723
00:59:29,535 --> 00:59:32,274
I almost died trying to stop him.

724
00:59:32,274 --> 00:59:36,419
She was passed out,
but he was trying to beat her up even more.

725
00:59:37,075 --> 00:59:38,380
You're right.

726
00:59:38,475 --> 00:59:41,444
When he loses it, he'll beat up anyone.

727
00:59:41,444 --> 00:59:43,919
Is he a psychopath?

728
00:59:44,515 --> 00:59:47,085
I don't want to end my
life under a subway seat.

729
00:59:47,085 --> 00:59:48,430
Me neither.

730
00:59:49,154 --> 00:59:53,130
Captain. Let's leave him
and make a run for it.

731
00:59:53,455 --> 00:59:56,625
Okay. I'll find the next available boat out.

732
00:59:56,625 --> 00:59:58,769
I'll pack a bag.

733
01:00:00,364 --> 01:00:02,380
This is why you need to
choose your friends wisely.

734
01:00:04,464 --> 01:00:06,450
You found that photo in the tunnel?

735
01:00:07,205 --> 01:00:09,619
How could you bear to look at it?

736
01:00:09,944 --> 01:00:11,419
How?

737
01:00:12,645 --> 01:00:16,689
I asked the most recent victim not to die.

738
01:00:18,915 --> 01:00:21,430
I said since she's the only person
who knows what he looks like,

739
01:00:22,355 --> 01:00:24,424
she can't die so irresponsibly.

740
01:00:24,424 --> 01:00:26,869
That's because you want to catch him.

741
01:00:27,154 --> 01:00:28,970
Because you want...

742
01:00:29,665 --> 01:00:31,470
to find Jin.

743
01:00:33,165 --> 01:00:35,110
I hate myself too, now.

744
01:00:36,564 --> 01:00:38,610
Even if Chief hates me,

745
01:00:39,475 --> 01:00:40,950
I can't blame him.

746
01:00:41,035 --> 01:00:42,249
Tell him.

747
01:00:42,745 --> 01:00:46,519
You said your chief thinks
you just wanted to join Metro.

748
01:00:46,745 --> 01:00:49,160
Why won't you tell him?

749
01:00:50,515 --> 01:00:51,919
Because...

750
01:00:52,915 --> 01:00:56,059
that starts with me
letting go of Jin's hand.

751
01:00:57,085 --> 01:00:58,559
Because both you and he...

752
01:00:59,154 --> 01:01:00,930
will think I'm a monster...

753
01:01:01,555 --> 01:01:03,499
if you find out I did that.

754
01:01:06,064 --> 01:01:07,269
See you.

755
01:01:20,114 --> 01:01:23,519
What's this? Soo Ho. Soo Ho.

756
01:01:24,484 --> 01:01:25,729
Look at this.

757
01:01:26,355 --> 01:01:28,484
Look. The guy who followed Newbie...

758
01:01:28,484 --> 01:01:30,883
looks like the Subway Ghost
who attacked Choi Mi Ra,

759
01:01:30,884 --> 01:01:32,200
right?

760
01:01:34,024 --> 01:01:36,169
You're right, he does.

761
01:01:44,134 --> 01:01:45,510
(Medicine)

762
01:01:46,475 --> 01:01:48,720
(Kim Hyung Soo)

763
01:01:53,814 --> 01:01:54,944
Hello?

764
01:01:54,944 --> 01:01:58,360
Chief. Remember that guy who
followed Newbie last time?

765
01:01:58,444 --> 01:02:01,889
That guy is the Subway Ghost.

766
01:02:02,085 --> 01:02:03,329
What?

767
01:02:04,254 --> 01:02:06,269
The guy who followed Newbie...

768
01:02:07,194 --> 01:02:08,869
is the Subway Ghost?

769
01:02:12,564 --> 01:02:14,669
Send me the video. Yes.

770
01:02:18,464 --> 01:02:22,419
Did your dissociative identity
disorder manifest again?

771
01:02:27,114 --> 01:02:28,320
No,

772
01:02:29,085 --> 01:02:30,789
it did not.

773
01:02:37,625 --> 01:02:38,999
I need...

774
01:02:40,024 --> 01:02:41,630
a lot more of the medicine.

775
01:02:42,265 --> 01:02:44,740
I'm taking a long trip abroad.

776
01:02:57,305 --> 01:02:58,579
What's this?

777
01:03:01,114 --> 01:03:03,289
What does your son do?

778
01:03:04,645 --> 01:03:06,189
Is he good looking?

779
01:03:17,564 --> 01:03:18,895
Wait.

780
01:03:18,895 --> 01:03:20,110
Auntie!

781
01:03:21,564 --> 01:03:22,780
Wait!

782
01:03:23,564 --> 01:03:24,939
Wait!

783
01:03:25,035 --> 01:03:26,150
Auntie.

784
01:03:27,174 --> 01:03:28,479
Auntie.

785
01:03:29,004 --> 01:03:30,220
Auntie!

786
01:03:30,774 --> 01:03:32,375
Wait!

787
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:34,749
Auntie. Are you okay?

788
01:03:37,944 --> 01:03:39,260
I'm fine.

789
01:03:39,455 --> 01:03:40,729
Who was that?

790
01:03:41,254 --> 01:03:44,499
I thought it was someone I knew.

791
01:03:46,524 --> 01:03:47,700
Excuse me.

792
01:03:53,335 --> 01:03:55,539
(You have an unchecked voicemail)

793
01:03:56,605 --> 01:03:58,773
Press one to listen to the message.

794
01:03:58,774 --> 01:04:01,749
Please enter your password.

795
01:04:02,174 --> 01:04:04,119
New message.

796
01:04:04,174 --> 01:04:08,150
Chief. When I asked for a new partner...

797
01:04:08,214 --> 01:04:11,959
It wasn't because I don't like you.

798
01:04:12,015 --> 01:04:13,430
I want...

799
01:04:13,555 --> 01:04:17,059
to keep being your partner.

800
01:04:18,524 --> 01:04:19,930
Really.

801
01:04:20,294 --> 01:04:21,499
I want...

802
01:04:22,165 --> 01:04:24,599
to stay by your side.

803
01:04:25,864 --> 01:04:27,269
But...

804
01:04:27,564 --> 01:04:29,939
if I stay by your side,

805
01:04:31,464 --> 01:04:34,050
I keep wanting to depend on you.

806
01:04:35,174 --> 01:04:38,079
Maybe I should tell you...

807
01:04:39,444 --> 01:04:42,419
why I joined the Subway Police
and what I've been doing...

808
01:04:43,745 --> 01:04:45,689
behind your back.

809
01:04:47,254 --> 01:04:49,559
I want to just tell you everything.

810
01:04:55,294 --> 01:04:56,970
"Maybe I should..."

811
01:04:57,895 --> 01:04:59,639
"tell you everything"?

812
01:05:03,064 --> 01:05:06,579
I'll tell you everything.

813
01:05:14,375 --> 01:05:18,220
Ryung had just one family member.

814
01:05:19,355 --> 01:05:22,130
Her twin sister who had autism.

815
01:05:22,424 --> 01:05:24,229
A twin sister?

816
01:05:25,924 --> 01:05:27,470
I never knew.

817
01:05:27,555 --> 01:05:29,240
But that sister...

818
01:05:30,165 --> 01:05:34,570
was murdered by the Subway Ghost.

819
01:05:38,464 --> 01:05:41,174
She walked around in all the stations...

820
01:05:41,174 --> 01:05:44,079
over and over, to figure out
where the Subway Ghost went.

821
01:05:45,274 --> 01:05:48,789
She didn't eat or sleep and walked
until her feet blistered up.

822
01:05:49,384 --> 01:05:53,289
The police ignored her although
her sister went missing,

823
01:05:53,814 --> 01:05:56,400
so she started to handle it all by herself.

824
01:05:57,254 --> 01:05:58,499
I want...

825
01:06:00,154 --> 01:06:02,740
to stay by your side.

826
01:06:28,514 --> 01:06:29,960
(Catch the Ghost)

827
01:06:30,184 --> 01:06:33,024
Newbie, I'll protect you from now on.

828
01:06:33,024 --> 01:06:35,024
You made me realize again...

829
01:06:35,024 --> 01:06:37,364
why I became a cop,

830
01:06:37,364 --> 01:06:39,839
and who I really am.

831
01:06:39,864 --> 01:06:41,639
Do you want some instant noodles?

832
01:06:42,364 --> 01:06:43,540
What?

833
01:06:44,035 --> 01:06:47,303
Police? Two murderers are chasing me.

834
01:06:47,304 --> 01:06:51,443
They're the Grasshoppers,
the guys in the Subway Ghost's gang.

835
01:06:51,444 --> 01:06:54,019
Mom's exhausted now.

836
01:06:54,274 --> 01:06:56,219
I will catch them!

837
01:06:56,385 --> 01:06:58,620
Me!
