{\an8}CATCH THE GHOST

3
00:00:24,934 --> 00:00:25,867
THIS DRAMA IS FICTION

4
00:00:25,934 --> 00:00:27,834
THE CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
INSTITUTIONS, AND EVENTS AREN'T REAL

00:00:29,433 --> 00:00:30,633
{\an8}LOW BALANCE

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,600
{\an8}The balance is low.

{\an8}EPISODE 3

8
00:00:36,633 --> 00:00:37,867
Well, then...

9
00:00:42,867 --> 00:00:44,834
I'll pay 400,000 won with this card.

10
00:00:45,367 --> 00:00:46,834
And the remaining 800,000 won...

11
00:00:47,967 --> 00:00:49,967
I will transfer it
by the day after tomorrow.

12
00:00:50,033 --> 00:00:51,767
Okay.

13
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,300
Her caretaker said
she hasn't gotten paid 2,000,000 won yet.

14
00:00:58,367 --> 00:00:59,567
-You know, right?
-Yes.

15
00:01:05,533 --> 00:01:06,967
-Thank you.
-Bye.

16
00:01:12,567 --> 00:01:13,667
Hello, Detective Lee.

17
00:01:16,734 --> 00:01:17,567
What?

18
00:01:18,066 --> 00:01:20,834
There's going to be a disciplinary
committee for Detective Yoo?

19
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,533
<i>It's hard to avoid it after shooting.</i>

20
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,533
<i>But the gun was yours,</i>

21
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,367
<i>so you might have to take responsibility.</i>

22
00:01:28,433 --> 00:01:29,266
What?

23
00:01:29,567 --> 00:01:31,400
I'm sorry for Detective Yoo, but...

24
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,667
Be sure to blame it all on Detective Yoo.

25
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,633
Hello, Captain.

26
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,867
<i>I told you not to shoot!</i>

27
00:01:49,834 --> 00:01:50,667
Sorry?

28
00:01:50,734 --> 00:01:53,233
The disciplinary committee
will be held for you tomorrow.

29
00:01:53,667 --> 00:01:56,166
Salary reduction is a given.
The worst could be suspension.

30
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,133
{\an8}DISCIPLINARY COMMITTEE

31
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,967
{\an8}It's obviously the reason for suspension.

32
00:02:15,033 --> 00:02:17,900
-It was too much for self-defense.
-Right.

33
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,433
What if the hostage had gotten shot?

34
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,000
Let's wrap up after listening
to the colleague who was on the site.

35
00:02:23,266 --> 00:02:24,233
Captain Ko Ji-seok.

36
00:02:26,266 --> 00:02:27,500
Do you have anything to say?

37
00:02:37,633 --> 00:02:39,800
This is a picture of Detective Yoo

38
00:02:40,367 --> 00:02:45,266
sitting on the stolen scooter.

39
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:48,166
She added on the siren illegally.

40
00:02:48,767 --> 00:02:52,900
This is the bill for the vandalism
from the Yeongdeungpo Station Office.

41
00:02:52,967 --> 00:02:56,834
Detective Yoo broke
the glass door of the restroom.

42
00:02:57,133 --> 00:02:59,433
I disapproved of it.

43
00:03:01,667 --> 00:03:05,367
Actually, her shooting was expected too.

44
00:03:06,233 --> 00:03:09,100
Detective Yoo acts before she thinks.

45
00:03:11,734 --> 00:03:12,867
Especially in front of bad guys.

46
00:03:14,867 --> 00:03:17,100
This is the doctor's note
for the deliveryman.

47
00:03:17,533 --> 00:03:20,200
If we hadn't broken the glass door
and stopped the bleeding,

48
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,100
he could have bled to death.

49
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:24,133
That's what it says.

50
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,300
With the stolen scooter,

51
00:03:28,734 --> 00:03:30,834
we saved a woman who almost got raped.

52
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,433
To save more citizens,

53
00:03:32,734 --> 00:03:34,166
she spent all her money on repairing it.

54
00:03:34,233 --> 00:03:37,133
And she upgraded the scooter
to the Subway Police's vehicle.

55
00:03:39,633 --> 00:03:40,800
In this case,

56
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:44,133
she shot the gun only to save the victim.

57
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,433
If Korean police officers
shoot their guns,

58
00:03:48,133 --> 00:03:50,367
we have a lot to lose and nothing to earn.

59
00:03:52,367 --> 00:03:55,066
That day, the culprit also mocked
Korean police officers

60
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,734
because he knew that this was our reality.

61
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,133
Penalizing her will undermine

62
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,767
the honor of the police.

63
00:04:08,033 --> 00:04:09,433
Please give us another chance.

64
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,233
I will teach her to be a better detective.

65
00:04:20,467 --> 00:04:21,300
I apologize.

66
00:04:21,367 --> 00:04:24,567
What would you do
if you're put in a similar situation?

67
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,433
I...

68
00:04:33,667 --> 00:04:36,033
I would shoot again.

69
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,100
-Jeez.
-Seriously?

70
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,100
As a police officer,

71
00:04:41,734 --> 00:04:44,367
I can't tell the daughter
that I couldn't save her father

72
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,967
because I'm afraid of penalty.

73
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,033
We'll decide by majority.

74
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,767
Who's for penalty?

75
00:04:56,834 --> 00:04:57,700
I am.

76
00:04:58,367 --> 00:04:59,300
I am.

77
00:05:02,567 --> 00:05:05,200
Four in favor and three in opposition.
She will be penalized...

78
00:05:05,266 --> 00:05:06,166
Wait.

79
00:05:06,834 --> 00:05:11,166
I raised my hand
to say something to Officer Yoo.

80
00:05:11,633 --> 00:05:12,533
Go on, ma'am.

81
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,734
Her heart is beating for the victims.

82
00:05:16,633 --> 00:05:18,633
She reminds me of when I was younger.

83
00:05:21,433 --> 00:05:22,667
I'm against penalizing her.

84
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,633
-You're good now.
-Thank you, Captain.

85
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,166
A person got hurt,

86
00:05:32,233 --> 00:05:34,400
and no one's being held
responsible for it?

87
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:36,800
Human rights groups won't sit back.

88
00:05:36,867 --> 00:05:37,700
I agree.

89
00:05:37,767 --> 00:05:39,500
It's all over the news,

90
00:05:39,567 --> 00:05:41,233
saying that it's a violation
of human rights!

91
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,000
So we must show some regret
by taking disciplinary action.

92
00:05:44,066 --> 00:05:46,633
I heard that the gun was
Captain Ko Ji-seok's.

93
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:48,000
Is that right?

94
00:05:48,967 --> 00:05:52,467
-Wait.
-The boss gave his own gun

95
00:05:52,533 --> 00:05:54,934
to the rookie who was not fully trained.

96
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,900
Isn't this a problem, Commissioner Kim?

97
00:06:04,467 --> 00:06:05,600
Well, ma'am.

98
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,700
I warned her 13 times not to shoot.

99
00:06:08,767 --> 00:06:11,166
We argued over
whether I would give her the gun or not.

100
00:06:11,233 --> 00:06:12,367
Captain Ko Ji-seok

101
00:06:14,066 --> 00:06:16,333
should be penalized
with a salary reduction.

102
00:06:18,133 --> 00:06:20,734
You should've shot first, not stop her.

103
00:06:21,633 --> 00:06:25,200
It's the citizens that give the guns
to the police officers

104
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,567
so the officers can protect them

105
00:06:27,967 --> 00:06:29,500
and save them from danger.

106
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,333
Captain Ko was passed out, so...

107
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,533
Do some self-reflection.

108
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:42,900
You were passed out...

109
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,533
Passed out?

110
00:06:48,633 --> 00:06:50,200
<i>We could have a team dinner another time.</i>

111
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,600
Hey, Rookie.

112
00:06:55,734 --> 00:06:58,867
He doesn't have a mean bone,
but you made him look bad, Rookie.

113
00:06:59,734 --> 00:07:00,633
I mean, Ms. Yoo.

114
00:07:03,967 --> 00:07:04,900
I am sorry.

115
00:07:05,834 --> 00:07:06,967
I'm okay.

116
00:07:07,467 --> 00:07:08,300
Eat up.

117
00:07:10,266 --> 00:07:11,266
You know,

118
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:14,033
about the picture and the bill...

119
00:07:15,033 --> 00:07:17,967
When did you prepare them?

120
00:07:18,033 --> 00:07:19,767
When you were running like a racehorse,

121
00:07:20,467 --> 00:07:22,500
I took pictures and prepared.

122
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,934
When did you find out
about the disciplinary committee?

123
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,233
The moment I met you.

124
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,600
I knew it at first sight.

125
00:07:30,266 --> 00:07:33,433
Thank you for saving me today, and...

126
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,166
It was to avoid responsibility,
not because I care.

127
00:07:38,633 --> 00:07:41,233
This is the last favor I'm doing for you.

128
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,266
I won't cover for you next time.

129
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:47,367
-Don't expect anything from me.
-Yes.

130
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,700
-Eat.
-Okay.

131
00:07:52,433 --> 00:07:54,400
I'm going to the lady's room.

132
00:07:58,133 --> 00:08:01,100
Two pork cheeks and steamed eggs, please.

133
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:02,000
Okay.

134
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,800
Isn't the salary reduction a problem?

135
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,767
You took out a loan to pay
for your mother's hospital bills.

136
00:08:07,367 --> 00:08:09,133
You shouldn't have covered for her.

137
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I am sorry, Captain.

138
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,033
What are you doing?

139
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:45,333
You always sleep outside because of me.

140
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,066
You can sleep inside now.

141
00:08:52,433 --> 00:08:54,333
No, that's okay. I can sleep on the chair.

142
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,567
It will take months
to build women's night-duty room.

143
00:08:57,633 --> 00:08:59,600
Will you sleep outside for months?

144
00:08:59,667 --> 00:09:01,433
I sleep better on the chair.

145
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,333
Well, then.

146
00:09:04,734 --> 00:09:06,266
I'll sleep outside.

147
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,533
I can't let my boss sleep outside
just because I'm a woman.

148
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,700
You rarely respect me as a boss.

149
00:09:14,834 --> 00:09:16,500
Anyway, I'm going out.

150
00:09:18,667 --> 00:09:19,834
Okay.

151
00:09:20,967 --> 00:09:22,133
Sleep here.

152
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:27,200
You're nothing but stubborn.

153
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:29,667
How can a person be so stubborn?

154
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,166
Jeez.

155
00:09:36,266 --> 00:09:37,400
Oh, goodness.

156
00:09:43,867 --> 00:09:45,333
-I will close the curtains.
-Sure.

157
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,266
-I'll close them.
-Okay.

158
00:10:03,367 --> 00:10:05,967
-Good night, sir.
-Yes, sleep tight.

159
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,533
Seriously.

160
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,700
Do you want to eat <i>ramyeon</i>?

161
00:11:37,233 --> 00:11:39,600
Which came first, the chicken or the egg?

162
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,133
That's random.

163
00:11:42,133 --> 00:11:42,967
Eggs?

164
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,934
No. Chicken must've come first.

165
00:11:46,834 --> 00:11:47,667
Why?

166
00:11:47,734 --> 00:11:50,400
Eggs can't hatch themselves
without the hens.

167
00:11:51,133 --> 00:11:52,800
Hens should keep the eggs warm

168
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,500
so that the chicks think
the world is a warm place to live in.

169
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,700
Then they'll try to crack the shell.

170
00:11:59,767 --> 00:12:00,900
The chicken keeps the egg warm.

171
00:12:02,467 --> 00:12:03,767
Then I guess chickens come first.

172
00:12:06,967 --> 00:12:08,133
Can we eat now?

173
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,033
Sure. Go ahead.

174
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,767
All right.

175
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,400
Did you learn taekwondo?

176
00:12:23,467 --> 00:12:26,800
I learned not only taekwondo,
but judo, hapkido, and karate.

177
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,200
It's 18 dan altogether.

178
00:12:29,266 --> 00:12:30,567
No way.

179
00:12:30,633 --> 00:12:33,300
You couldn't even reach your arm
when you got beaten.

180
00:12:33,967 --> 00:12:36,166
I learned sports, not how to fight.

181
00:12:39,533 --> 00:12:41,300
Even so, I can't believe it.

182
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:43,500
Do you want me to show you?

183
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,266
-Sure.
-Shall I do a turning kick here?

184
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,934
-Really?
-I wasn't going to do it, but...

185
00:12:52,066 --> 00:12:55,433
I trained at Laura Taekwondo.
Don't underestimate me.

186
00:12:58,033 --> 00:12:59,433
Are you ready?

187
00:13:22,433 --> 00:13:23,300
Awesome.

188
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,400
It's not a big deal.

189
00:13:28,967 --> 00:13:29,800
It's nothing.

190
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,700
-You do hold 18 dan.
-Of course.

191
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,567
Why?

192
00:13:35,633 --> 00:13:37,133
Let's stop eating. It's late.

193
00:13:38,266 --> 00:13:40,266
No way we'll stop eating.

194
00:14:02,066 --> 00:14:02,967
I'll throw it away.

195
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,800
SCREEN DOOR

196
00:14:44,433 --> 00:14:47,300
Sorry, Captain.

197
00:15:19,667 --> 00:15:21,734
It's me!

198
00:15:22,667 --> 00:15:25,066
What are you doing
in the women's restroom?

199
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:27,900
You didn't seem to know
the lights were almost out.

200
00:15:27,967 --> 00:15:30,100
You scared me to death.

201
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,033
Let's go.

202
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,567
Am I at fault here?

203
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,133
I was startled.

204
00:15:41,967 --> 00:15:43,233
I was more frightened.

205
00:15:44,433 --> 00:15:46,600
I'm sorry about the screaming.

206
00:15:53,533 --> 00:15:56,500
The lights suddenly went out,
so I came to check on you.

207
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,066
We must get him quickly.
It's the Subway Ghost.

208
00:16:00,133 --> 00:16:03,100
What makes you think
that it's the Subway Ghost?

209
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:06,367
The Subway Ghost moves
the bodies through the tunnel.

210
00:16:19,033 --> 00:16:21,166
SEOUN METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

INVESTIGATION REPORT

PLEASE FIND MY TWIN SISTER

214
00:16:54,767 --> 00:16:56,834
That security footage by the stairs.

215
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,567
Ko Ji-seok promised to give it.
You haven't received it, right?

216
00:17:00,633 --> 00:17:01,867
No. I'll call him now.

217
00:17:01,934 --> 00:17:03,700
No. We'll go to him.

218
00:17:11,433 --> 00:17:14,800
The Locust bastards.
If only there were fingerprints.

219
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:18,133
So where did you find it?

220
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,400
As soon as they got your wallet,

221
00:17:20,467 --> 00:17:22,700
they let it fall to the tracks to hide it.

222
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,333
I found out the method

223
00:17:24,734 --> 00:17:26,934
and chased after him in the tunnel...

224
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,834
Chased after him?

225
00:17:29,033 --> 00:17:30,266
In the tunnel?

226
00:17:31,734 --> 00:17:34,700
The Subway Police had an issue
with the tunnel before.

227
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:37,500
The tunnel is a restricted area.

228
00:17:37,567 --> 00:17:39,166
Yes, I'm aware.

229
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,967
So I wanted to chase after him
in the tunnel,

230
00:17:45,767 --> 00:17:48,166
but I couldn't get into the tunnel.

231
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,500
A station employee got it out

232
00:17:49,767 --> 00:17:52,066
after operation hours,
which is the policy.

233
00:17:53,533 --> 00:17:56,433
As soon as they got the wallet,
they let it fall to the tracks.

234
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,467
That creative method

235
00:17:58,533 --> 00:18:00,800
was figured out by the police
in only one day.

236
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:03,300
Ma'am, this could be good PR.

237
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,767
No, you can't do that.

238
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:06,834
What? Why not?

239
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,433
They were

240
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,800
wearing the Podori costumes.

241
00:18:12,533 --> 00:18:13,667
Podori?

242
00:18:13,734 --> 00:18:16,667
So I, the police commissioner,
got pickpocketed by Podoris?

243
00:18:19,967 --> 00:18:20,967
Officer Jeon.

244
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,600
Didn't the PR Team prepare the Podoris?

245
00:18:23,667 --> 00:18:27,967
Well, we didn't actually bring them.

246
00:18:28,033 --> 00:18:30,467
Didn't you think it was suspicious
the Podoris were there

247
00:18:30,533 --> 00:18:32,133
when you didn't even call them?

248
00:18:33,734 --> 00:18:38,100
I thought my juniors called them.

249
00:18:42,834 --> 00:18:45,100
So, how are you planning to investigate?

250
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,300
We're planning to ask around

251
00:18:46,367 --> 00:18:48,967
costume shops for people
who ordered the Podori costumes.

252
00:18:49,033 --> 00:18:51,700
Find them as soon as possible
and close the case. Okay?

253
00:18:51,767 --> 00:18:54,300
Don't humiliate me again.

254
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:55,200
Yes, ma'am.

255
00:18:58,533 --> 00:19:01,867
COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE

256
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,233
Ji-seok.

257
00:19:08,233 --> 00:19:09,333
Yes, sir.

258
00:19:09,734 --> 00:19:13,133
You took out the corpse
in front of reporters.

259
00:19:13,934 --> 00:19:16,433
To clean up the mess you made then,

260
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,600
I still go home once every three days.

261
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:25,200
And now you're saying
Podoris are the Locust Swarm?

262
00:19:30,667 --> 00:19:32,900
You're waiting for your penalty
to be finalized, right?

263
00:19:34,266 --> 00:19:37,734
I don't think
the salary reduction is enough.

264
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,266
No way.

265
00:19:44,467 --> 00:19:46,233
This is driving me crazy.

266
00:19:48,967 --> 00:19:52,033
So, you don't want to cut the deal?

267
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,667
It's not that I don't want to.
It's the amount.

268
00:19:57,533 --> 00:20:00,200
I think 5,000 is a good offer.

269
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:03,934
Stop it.

270
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:07,033
My side is very sensitive.
Don't bother me on such a hot day!

271
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,133
Just give it to me at 5,000 won.

272
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,400
It's 10,000 won.

273
00:20:11,233 --> 00:20:13,967
Okay. I'm accepting it
only because it's your son's birthday.

274
00:20:14,033 --> 00:20:14,967
Thank you.

275
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,000
Ji-hwan will be over the moon.

276
00:20:20,667 --> 00:20:22,200
Give me the new one.

277
00:20:22,266 --> 00:20:24,533
Gosh, move aside.

278
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,800
-Thank you. Have a good day!
-You too.

279
00:20:29,867 --> 00:20:31,300
Water.

280
00:20:33,834 --> 00:20:35,133
-Bye.
-Okay.

281
00:20:39,467 --> 00:20:40,333
Do-cheol!

282
00:20:44,033 --> 00:20:46,600
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Choi.

283
00:20:47,934 --> 00:20:51,066
But if you're late again,
I think you'll be more sorry.

284
00:20:51,133 --> 00:20:54,633
Yes. I'm so sorry.

285
00:20:57,967 --> 00:20:58,800
My goodness!

286
00:20:58,867 --> 00:21:00,967
-Gosh, my toe.
-My hands are sweaty, so it slipped.

287
00:21:01,033 --> 00:21:02,000
You bastard!

288
00:21:02,367 --> 00:21:03,433
You did it on purpose!

289
00:21:05,533 --> 00:21:06,633
It's already time?

290
00:21:07,533 --> 00:21:09,033
I will wire the money right away.

291
00:21:09,767 --> 00:21:10,934
Damn.

292
00:21:16,433 --> 00:21:19,900
"Gosh, my toe. You bastard!
You did it on purpose!"

293
00:21:19,967 --> 00:21:21,467
-Wasn't I good?
-The best!

294
00:21:21,533 --> 00:21:23,600
Those bastards.

295
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,834
Why hasn't the Grim Reaper
taken them already?

296
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,033
Hello.

297
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,100
Hi, Captain Ko.

298
00:21:30,266 --> 00:21:32,767
I guess you want chili <i>gimbap</i>
and fishcake broth?

299
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:34,834
-Bingo.
-I got it.

300
00:21:39,266 --> 00:21:42,667
Just tell Captain Ko everything.

301
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:45,700
Until when will you
suck up to those bastards?

302
00:21:45,767 --> 00:21:49,033
Just get rid of those bastards,
Gold Watch and Bass.

303
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:49,934
Gold Watch?

304
00:21:52,567 --> 00:21:53,400
Well...

305
00:21:53,467 --> 00:21:55,834
It's a new place that sells gold watches.

306
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:59,266
It's 14K. The plated one.

307
00:22:00,567 --> 00:22:02,367
-Bye.
-It is plated with pure gold.

308
00:22:02,433 --> 00:22:05,633
SURI SNACK BAR

309
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,900
-Thank you.
-Have some more.

310
00:22:06,967 --> 00:22:07,834
Captain!

311
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,400
How did the briefing go?

312
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,266
It wasn't a briefing.
It was a fabrication.

313
00:22:19,834 --> 00:22:21,433
-Okay.
-I told you.

314
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,233
We'll lose our jobs if they find out
that we went into the tunnel.

315
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,533
I told them a station employee got it.

316
00:22:29,233 --> 00:22:30,333
I'm sorry.

317
00:22:31,633 --> 00:22:34,133
I should return the screen door key too.

318
00:22:36,767 --> 00:22:39,000
Wait. Where's it gone?

319
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:42,433
I'm sure it was here.

320
00:22:43,467 --> 00:22:46,367
You saw I had it
when I was on night duty, right?

321
00:22:46,967 --> 00:22:48,333
Did I?

322
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,200
I am sure it was here
when I was on night duty.

323
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,100
Maybe it's in my sweatpants.

324
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:58,734
I was going to take it out
because it pokes me when I'm sleeping.

325
00:23:00,367 --> 00:23:02,800
Then, you must have taken it out
while you were sleeping.

326
00:23:03,734 --> 00:23:06,667
I will go check the night-duty room.

327
00:23:10,367 --> 00:23:11,200
I'm sorry.

328
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,867
Ma-ri.

329
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,600
What are you doing here?

330
00:23:23,934 --> 00:23:27,100
I'm here because you aren't
doing your job right.

331
00:23:28,433 --> 00:23:29,266
What?

332
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,433
-Is this your partner?
-Partner?

333
00:23:32,967 --> 00:23:34,166
This is our rookie.

334
00:23:34,633 --> 00:23:37,433
This is Chief Ha Ma-ri
of the Regional Investigation Unit.

335
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,834
This is Detective Kim Wu-hyeok.

336
00:23:41,867 --> 00:23:43,000
Nice to meet you.

337
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,333
Yes.

338
00:23:44,867 --> 00:23:47,900
-Seriously. What brings you here?
-We're here for the security footage.

339
00:23:48,567 --> 00:23:52,200
Right. I got in a taxi to go to you,
but something happened in the tunnel.

340
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,667
The tunnel? What happened?

341
00:23:56,734 --> 00:23:58,867
No, it was nothing big.

342
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,400
What?

343
00:24:02,467 --> 00:24:04,333
Look in every corner.

344
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,934
The screen door key is so small
that it could be anywhere in the room.

345
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,233
Okay?

346
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,233
You lost the screen door key?

347
00:24:11,667 --> 00:24:13,166
I think I dropped it somewhere.

348
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,367
I have to go there
for the security footage anyway.

349
00:24:16,433 --> 00:24:17,266
I will go get it.

350
00:24:22,066 --> 00:24:23,667
Why do you act as if we've never met?

351
00:24:28,367 --> 00:24:30,467
Did you always want to be
a police officer?

352
00:24:31,633 --> 00:24:33,834
What about the Subway Police?
Did you apply to join?

353
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,133
Mind your own business.

354
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,633
Did you steal the screen door key?

355
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,767
Did you go into the tunnel?

356
00:24:46,834 --> 00:24:48,467
I told you to mind your own business.

357
00:24:54,834 --> 00:24:56,834
Did she really join to find her sister?

358
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,767
I'll get the security footage.
Wait for me in the car.

359
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,233
Ms. Yoo!

360
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,033
Ms. Yoo.

361
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,700
Yes, you're right.

362
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,734
I stole the screen door key
to get into the tunnel. Happy now?

363
00:25:18,967 --> 00:25:19,900
<i>Please.</i>

364
00:25:20,834 --> 00:25:24,100
Please review her case
as a subway murder case.

365
00:25:24,166 --> 00:25:26,133
Please help me.

366
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,233
Join the RIU.

367
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,800
Catch the Subway Ghost with us.

368
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,166
Bye.

369
00:25:46,033 --> 00:25:47,900
Here is the security footage.

370
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:52,133
Do you know each other?

371
00:25:52,533 --> 00:25:53,367
Yes.

372
00:25:54,166 --> 00:25:55,734
-How?
-We just do.

373
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,033
I see.

374
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,266
-What did you talk about?
-I asked her to join the RIU.

375
00:26:03,734 --> 00:26:05,300
What did she say?

376
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,233
I guess she'll join.
We share the same goal.

377
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,400
You share the same goal?

378
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:12,367
Well, everyone has their own skills.

379
00:26:12,433 --> 00:26:15,000
She seems to be a better fit
for physical tasks.

380
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,133
I'm fine with it.

381
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,934
Don't mind me. Good job asking her.

382
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,700
Then, take care.

383
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,433
Thanks.

384
00:26:25,233 --> 00:26:26,066
Bye.

385
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,033
Why do you act as if we've never met?

386
00:26:46,266 --> 00:26:47,767
Did you steal the screen door key?

387
00:26:48,834 --> 00:26:50,700
<i>I have to hurry
before Ha Ma-ri says something.</i>

388
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,300
BLUEPRINT OF TUNNEL
WANGSURI STATION

389
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:18,834
<i>There's no way
the Subway Ghost could get out</i>

390
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,934
<i>without being captured
on security cameras inside the station.</i>

391
00:27:23,367 --> 00:27:26,567
<i>The tunnel is the only area
without security cameras.</i>

392
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,633
<i>He must have moved through the tunnel.</i>

393
00:27:46,867 --> 00:27:49,500
<i>The lines where the bodies were found
or the victims went missing</i>

394
00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:52,100
<i>all go through Wangsuri Station.</i>

395
00:27:52,333 --> 00:27:55,500
<i>Especially the missing locations
were less than three stops from Wangsuri.</i>

396
00:27:56,467 --> 00:27:58,734
<i>It's a walking distance
through the tunnel.</i>

397
00:28:00,967 --> 00:28:04,200
<i>He must've transferred here.</i>

398
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,700
<i>If I follow the route he possibly took,</i>

399
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,900
<i>I'll be able to find a trace of him.</i>

400
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,700
If you get 10 discs,
I'll give you each at 10,000 won.

401
00:28:45,433 --> 00:28:47,433
It's the Best 100 Songs
from the '80s and '90s.

402
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,834
Why, thank you.

403
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,367
The Best Songs in the '80s and '90s.

404
00:28:51,433 --> 00:28:52,567
Okay, thank you.

405
00:28:53,033 --> 00:28:55,066
Shall we get him? It's illegal.

406
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,333
Sorry for causing a nuisance.
I have a family to support.

407
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,266
Please excuse me.

408
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,100
If no one wants to buy one,
I'll say goodbye.

409
00:29:04,166 --> 00:29:06,033
He's leaving. I'll catch him.

410
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,967
When I was young,

411
00:29:19,033 --> 00:29:21,967
I tried on my father's shoes
because they looked amazing.

412
00:29:22,767 --> 00:29:24,266
They were heavier than I expected.

413
00:29:24,767 --> 00:29:27,433
I thought it was
because I was too small for them.

414
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,233
Now they are heavier than before.

415
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,967
A youngster like you wouldn't understand.

416
00:29:36,033 --> 00:29:37,734
It's called responsibility as a father.

417
00:29:39,233 --> 00:29:40,600
Let's not make it hard for him.

418
00:29:42,066 --> 00:29:42,900
Okay.

419
00:29:43,233 --> 00:29:44,066
Father.

420
00:29:44,767 --> 00:29:45,667
Don't.

421
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:46,767
Focus.

422
00:29:58,133 --> 00:30:01,333
Ones who keep looking around
and ones who push against women.

423
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,934
Look out for those guys.

424
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,266
Of course, you wouldn't care
about this kind of stuff.

425
00:30:07,633 --> 00:30:08,700
Captain.

426
00:30:09,867 --> 00:30:11,667
The other day,

427
00:30:11,734 --> 00:30:15,100
you seemed to know Chief Ha Ma-ri well.

428
00:30:15,867 --> 00:30:17,700
We went to the police university together.

429
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:22,467
Oh, so you're friends from college.

430
00:30:26,233 --> 00:30:27,633
We may be friends,

431
00:30:28,233 --> 00:30:29,900
but we don't do favors for a job position.

432
00:30:29,967 --> 00:30:32,133
-Sorry?
-Focus on your current job.

433
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,533
Sure.

434
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,533
GOODBYE CASH

435
00:30:57,467 --> 00:30:58,834
<i>The doors are closing.</i>

436
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,700
These flyers are all illegal.

437
00:31:02,467 --> 00:31:03,333
Let's get rid of them.

438
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,266
-Give it to me.
-What are you doing?

439
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:18,133
-Give it to me.
-What a weirdo.

440
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,367
Where's my money? I know you took it.

441
00:31:20,433 --> 00:31:21,467
Have you gone crazy?

442
00:31:21,533 --> 00:31:23,967
Where's my two million won?

443
00:31:24,567 --> 00:31:26,600
Hey, man. You took it, didn't you?

444
00:31:28,667 --> 00:31:30,967
-No. It's not me.
-Get out of my way!

445
00:31:31,033 --> 00:31:32,867
Where's my two million won?

446
00:31:37,166 --> 00:31:38,433
Calm down, sir!

447
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:41,433
Who are you? Let me go.

448
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,800
-Calm down.
-Two million won!

449
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:43,700
We're police officers.

450
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,900
-Give me my two million won back.
-Sir!

451
00:31:45,967 --> 00:31:47,900
I lost two million won.

452
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,000
Two million...

453
00:32:12,333 --> 00:32:15,433
The Best 100 Songs in the '80s and '90s.

454
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,734
Excuse me. Coming through.

455
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:33,767
Have some tea.

456
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,700
Sorry.

457
00:32:39,066 --> 00:32:41,500
I lost my money... Oh, goodness.

458
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:50,333
Why did you suddenly stop earlier?

459
00:32:52,467 --> 00:32:54,066
Oh, that.

460
00:32:55,233 --> 00:32:56,100
That...

461
00:33:00,066 --> 00:33:03,700
<i>If I were the sky</i>

462
00:33:04,367 --> 00:33:08,066
<i>I'd want to be tinged with your face</i>

463
00:33:09,934 --> 00:33:11,166
How adorable.

464
00:33:11,367 --> 00:33:12,667
He is, right?

465
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,700
But...

466
00:33:15,367 --> 00:33:18,467
I thought of only one thing
at this moment.

467
00:33:18,934 --> 00:33:22,333
"I will do everything
to support my family."

468
00:33:22,867 --> 00:33:23,834
And...

469
00:33:24,667 --> 00:33:29,367
I want to see my boy, Ji-hwan,
smile all the time.

470
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,700
Please wait at home.
We'll call you when we find the money.

471
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,700
Goodbye.

472
00:33:45,767 --> 00:33:47,000
Please find my money.

473
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,133
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

474
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,100
He had the money
when he entered the station.

475
00:33:56,734 --> 00:33:59,567
Let's look at the security footage
from the exits to the platform.

476
00:33:59,633 --> 00:34:00,600
I will go get it.

477
00:34:02,233 --> 00:34:03,133
Send a request first.

478
00:34:05,133 --> 00:34:06,033
Yes, sir.

479
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,533
Mom!

480
00:34:14,867 --> 00:34:18,567
<i>Honey, make sure to bring
Ji-hwan's birthday present.</i>

481
00:34:18,867 --> 00:34:21,834
<i>He's waiting for you, so come home early.</i>

482
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:29,233
GOODBYE CASH

483
00:34:48,133 --> 00:34:49,900
Ji-hwan, are you okay?

484
00:34:49,967 --> 00:34:50,800
Yes.

485
00:34:50,867 --> 00:34:51,867
Oh, good.

486
00:34:53,367 --> 00:34:56,633
Why did you come here?
It's Ji-hwan's school.

487
00:34:56,700 --> 00:35:00,500
So don't dodge my calls.
I didn't want to come all the way, either.

488
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,467
Let's go.

489
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:04,800
Is Ji-hwan's dad a gangster?

490
00:35:04,867 --> 00:35:07,367
I'm scared. I'm leaving.

491
00:35:07,433 --> 00:35:08,300
Me too.

492
00:35:11,333 --> 00:35:14,433
Dad, who is this?

493
00:35:14,934 --> 00:35:15,767
Well...

494
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,367
He's my friend.

495
00:35:21,367 --> 00:35:23,633
I don't usually do this in front of kids.

496
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,433
I'm not buying it. Not here.

497
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,567
Well, yes.

498
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:31,367
This gentleman is a watch seller.

499
00:35:31,433 --> 00:35:32,834
Where I deliver water...

500
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,967
You bastard. Have you gone mad?

501
00:35:37,133 --> 00:35:40,100
Hey, buddy. Don't do this.

502
00:35:40,934 --> 00:35:44,633
This looks authentic up close.

503
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:47,667
I will buy this from you, buddy.

504
00:35:47,734 --> 00:35:52,533
But I don't have cash on me right now.

505
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,867
I will pay you there.

506
00:35:57,233 --> 00:36:00,433
Let's go, buddy.
Ji-hwan, I'm off with my friend.

507
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,367
-Go home. See you later.
-Okay.

508
00:36:02,433 --> 00:36:03,333
Okay.

509
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,700
He dropped it there.

510
00:36:12,734 --> 00:36:14,400
Who picked it up?

511
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,834
What? It's the disc seller.

512
00:36:22,667 --> 00:36:23,500
This man.

513
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,166
I should've caught him earlier.

514
00:36:26,967 --> 00:36:29,667
How stupid. I've lost my hunch.

515
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,133
I got fooled by the family story.

516
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,266
Let's get him.

517
00:36:33,633 --> 00:36:36,500
It's embezzlement of a lost article
if he takes a lost property it.

518
00:36:36,567 --> 00:36:38,600
He'll return it
unless he wants to be convicted.

519
00:36:38,667 --> 00:36:41,333
I will track him down.

520
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:44,166
Gosh. He's such a bad guy.

521
00:36:54,767 --> 00:36:58,266
I may have a shameful job,

522
00:36:58,767 --> 00:37:00,433
but I'm not a shameful father.

523
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,233
Thank you.

524
00:37:10,367 --> 00:37:11,266
Please forgive me.

525
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,500
I take back what I said.

526
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:19,867
Your father is awesome.

527
00:37:20,467 --> 00:37:23,367
He knows 100 songs.

528
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,800
Isn't he great? I know only one song.

529
00:37:26,867 --> 00:37:28,900
He knows 100 songs?

530
00:37:28,967 --> 00:37:30,066
I'm so sorry.

531
00:37:30,133 --> 00:37:32,467
Have a seat over there. Let's go.

532
00:37:32,533 --> 00:37:34,233
-Give me 10,000 won.
-I don't have cash.

533
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,033
Just give me 10,000 won.

534
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,166
Take a seat.

535
00:37:38,233 --> 00:37:39,934
-Do you want some cold water?
-Sure.

536
00:37:41,233 --> 00:37:43,200
I'm going home now.

537
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:46,767
He knows 100 songs? How amazing.

538
00:37:46,834 --> 00:37:48,600
Call the man that we found the money.

539
00:37:48,667 --> 00:37:50,300
-Yes.
-Goodbye.

540
00:37:50,367 --> 00:37:51,367
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

541
00:37:51,433 --> 00:37:53,500
The man's phone number...

542
00:37:53,834 --> 00:37:57,667
I think there was a misunderstanding
because there are so many cases.

543
00:37:57,734 --> 00:38:01,300
<i>The phone is turned off.
You'll be connected to...</i>

544
00:38:01,367 --> 00:38:02,200
It's off.

545
00:38:02,266 --> 00:38:04,233
Gosh, he's so amazing.

546
00:38:08,066 --> 00:38:09,066
Damn it.

547
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,400
You didn't know you'd get beaten
by a watch seller?

548
00:38:16,066 --> 00:38:18,667
You sucked up to me,
saying your son was sick.

549
00:38:18,734 --> 00:38:20,734
And now you're playing me?

550
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,867
I should be able to work to pay you back.

551
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,667
But you, Mr. Gold Watch,
follow me everywhere I work,

552
00:38:27,734 --> 00:38:30,967
and it gets me fired.
So how can I pay you back?

553
00:38:31,033 --> 00:38:31,967
You bastard.

554
00:38:35,467 --> 00:38:36,967
This customer seems unhappy.

555
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,533
How badly did you manage your customers?

556
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,400
I am sorry.

557
00:38:43,166 --> 00:38:44,166
Manage him properly.

558
00:38:45,934 --> 00:38:48,934
Also, take care of this
walnut cake shop customer.

559
00:38:49,533 --> 00:38:52,033
So many people borrow money
and do not pay back.

560
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,100
It gives me a headache.

561
00:38:54,066 --> 00:38:54,900
Hey!

562
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:56,633
Do it right.

563
00:38:56,967 --> 00:38:58,100
I'm off.

564
00:39:18,767 --> 00:39:19,600
Ji-hwan.

565
00:39:20,266 --> 00:39:21,600
There are many ways,

566
00:39:21,667 --> 00:39:23,500
but threatening with family
works the best.

567
00:39:26,567 --> 00:39:28,533
No. Please don't!

568
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,266
Especially, there are many ways
a woman can make money.

569
00:39:32,734 --> 00:39:35,333
Kids need their mom.

570
00:39:36,767 --> 00:39:38,500
How will Ji-hwan live alone from now on?

571
00:39:38,567 --> 00:39:39,400
Please don't.

572
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:48,600
Please don't hurt Ji-hwan and my wife...

573
00:39:49,467 --> 00:39:52,066
I don't care what happens to me.

574
00:39:52,133 --> 00:39:54,000
I will do whatever you tell me to do.

575
00:39:54,066 --> 00:39:58,900
So don't hurt Ji-hwan and my wife, please.

576
00:40:01,734 --> 00:40:02,600
Please.

577
00:40:09,767 --> 00:40:12,533
Do you want me to remove
your debt at once?

578
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:15,734
What?

579
00:40:16,533 --> 00:40:17,967
It takes only one task.

580
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,900
It's time for your checkup.

581
00:40:39,967 --> 00:40:40,800
What?

582
00:40:40,867 --> 00:40:42,967
No, ma'am.

583
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:46,734
My boyfriend will come soon.

584
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,300
It won't take long.

585
00:40:48,633 --> 00:40:49,467
What?

586
00:40:50,166 --> 00:40:52,266
He said he's almost here.

587
00:40:52,967 --> 00:40:54,033
We can't do this.

588
00:40:56,533 --> 00:40:57,367
Ma'am.

589
00:40:58,066 --> 00:40:59,467
You fancy my boyfriend, right?

590
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,767
Every time you see him,

591
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:04,467
you flirt with him
with that smile of yours.

592
00:41:04,533 --> 00:41:06,300
What are you talking about?

593
00:41:06,367 --> 00:41:09,367
Even now, you're trying to stop us
from seeing each other.

594
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:10,934
I know everything.

595
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,033
Don't look down on me because I'm young.

596
00:41:13,734 --> 00:41:14,600
It's not that.

597
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,533
It's ten million won.

598
00:41:24,767 --> 00:41:25,600
Sorry?

599
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,333
The machine is worth ten million won.

600
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,467
It's completely broken down.

601
00:41:32,066 --> 00:41:35,433
We were supposed to use it
for over ten patients today.

602
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:37,600
Mom...

603
00:41:38,967 --> 00:41:39,800
Honey.

604
00:42:03,033 --> 00:42:04,100
Yes, right.

605
00:42:04,867 --> 00:42:06,567
I already have a mortgage on the house.

606
00:42:07,133 --> 00:42:09,066
Can't I take out more loans?

607
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,734
<i>No, you can't.</i>

608
00:42:11,166 --> 00:42:14,300
<i>You know your current mortgage
will mature in two months?</i>

609
00:42:14,367 --> 00:42:16,400
Yes, I do.

610
00:42:17,333 --> 00:42:18,166
Okay.

611
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,700
GOODBYE CASH

612
00:42:31,767 --> 00:42:33,567
"Regard to the legal interest rate."

613
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,800
"Pay back in seven days,
and you may pay no interest."

614
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:13,967
Hello.

615
00:43:15,433 --> 00:43:17,533
Let's make a list of costume shops.

616
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,734
We have to look for one
that made Podori costumes.

617
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,500
-Okay.
<i>-The phone is turned off...</i>

618
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,033
Captain.

619
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,533
About the man
who lost his money yesterday...

620
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,934
I've tried to reach him,
but he's not answering.

621
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,033
Run a check on his ID
and call him at home.

622
00:43:32,567 --> 00:43:33,400
Yes, sir.

623
00:43:33,734 --> 00:43:36,600
Detective Lee.
I will search around Gangnam-gu.

624
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,834
You search the shops
near Wangsuri Station.

625
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:39,734
Yes.

626
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:41,567
There are too many.

627
00:43:44,266 --> 00:43:45,233
Hello?

628
00:43:45,467 --> 00:43:46,934
Is this Mr. Choi Do-cheol's house?

629
00:43:47,867 --> 00:43:48,800
This is the police.

630
00:43:48,867 --> 00:43:52,233
We have Mr. Choi's lost property.

631
00:43:54,633 --> 00:43:56,934
What? Missing?

632
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,867
Please find my husband.

633
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:07,266
I've already called the police.

634
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,100
They said he can't be filed as missing
because he's an adult.

635
00:44:12,533 --> 00:44:15,734
Have you contacted all the places
that he might have gone to?

636
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:16,767
I have.

637
00:44:17,767 --> 00:44:18,700
Apparently,

638
00:44:19,433 --> 00:44:20,800
at my son's school yesterday...

639
00:44:21,133 --> 00:44:24,100
Some kind of a seller stopped by.

640
00:44:24,166 --> 00:44:26,734
My husband went with the man.

641
00:44:27,333 --> 00:44:29,700
If it's a seller, could he be a coworker?

642
00:44:31,867 --> 00:44:35,100
Contact Mr. Choi's acquaintances
and wait a few days...

643
00:44:35,166 --> 00:44:37,266
Dad said he'd barge in.

644
00:44:38,033 --> 00:44:38,867
What?

645
00:44:39,467 --> 00:44:41,567
Yesterday was my birthday.

646
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,300
We promised to play the cops.

647
00:44:44,934 --> 00:44:47,867
We said I'd catch him when he barges in.

648
00:44:49,266 --> 00:44:52,233
Dad always keeps his promises.

649
00:44:53,667 --> 00:44:54,533
Detective.

650
00:44:55,834 --> 00:44:58,700
My husband didn't run away.

651
00:44:59,533 --> 00:45:01,066
I know him better than anyone.

652
00:45:02,367 --> 00:45:03,567
He didn't run away.

653
00:45:04,934 --> 00:45:06,333
He's gone missing.

654
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:13,567
Please review my sister's disappearance
as a subway murder case.

655
00:45:13,633 --> 00:45:16,233
We'll investigate her case
once her body is found.

656
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:17,133
Take her away.

657
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:19,133
-Get her out of here.
-I'm sorry.

658
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,834
Don't worry.

659
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:25,333
We'll...

660
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,967
In the case of adults,
to investigate as a missing person,

661
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,867
we need proof that
the disappearance is linked to a crime.

662
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,266
I am sorry,

663
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,834
but there's nothing we can do now.

664
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:54,333
-I will look into it.
-Rookie.

665
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,100
Don't worry too much.

666
00:45:56,166 --> 00:45:59,300
You have a child, so I think
you should go home and wait there.

667
00:46:01,834 --> 00:46:02,867
Thank you.

668
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:08,400
Detective. Thank you so much.

669
00:46:09,567 --> 00:46:11,900
Please find my husband.

670
00:46:12,867 --> 00:46:14,767
-I will call you.
-Okay.

671
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:31,000
My goodness.

672
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,433
I'll do the location tracking
on Mr. Choi Do-cheol, and...

673
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:38,600
A missing case exposes
the details of a person's life.

674
00:46:39,066 --> 00:46:41,667
Checking the phone log
shows all the personal texts.

675
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:45,400
Talking to his acquaintances would expose
the relationships he might want to hide.

676
00:46:45,967 --> 00:46:48,800
Proceeding a missing case
without any evidence of a crime

677
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:51,033
is a human rights violation.

678
00:46:51,467 --> 00:46:53,834
Investigating husbands
that simply slept somewhere else

679
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:56,734
have gotten the police accused
in many cases.

680
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,133
Call the wife and tell her

681
00:46:58,633 --> 00:47:01,667
that we can't investigate this case.

682
00:47:02,066 --> 00:47:03,066
What if

683
00:47:04,567 --> 00:47:06,834
Mr. Choi Do-cheol is in danger right now?

684
00:47:07,734 --> 00:47:09,200
The wife said

685
00:47:09,734 --> 00:47:11,800
he wouldn't disappear without a word.

686
00:47:11,867 --> 00:47:14,166
You can't be 100 percent sure
about the other person!

687
00:47:15,133 --> 00:47:17,400
Don't you know that everyone has a secret?

688
00:47:17,467 --> 00:47:19,100
-But...
-That's enough.

689
00:47:19,767 --> 00:47:20,767
I'm not allowing this.

690
00:47:23,367 --> 00:47:25,266
How many costume shops
have you looked into?

691
00:47:25,333 --> 00:47:27,266
We've contacted half of them,

692
00:47:27,333 --> 00:47:29,633
but no place was asked to make
Podori costumes.

693
00:47:29,934 --> 00:47:31,266
Look into the others.

694
00:47:31,333 --> 00:47:33,500
I'll go to the ones
that we can't reach over the phone.

695
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:35,934
Rookie.

696
00:47:36,667 --> 00:47:38,834
Take every train from now on.

697
00:47:39,967 --> 00:47:41,266
Work until the last train

698
00:47:42,367 --> 00:47:43,600
and make arrests.

699
00:48:04,367 --> 00:48:06,767
Penguin, pig, pig, penguin, pig.

700
00:48:08,233 --> 00:48:10,600
Pig... Don't you have any other logs?

701
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:11,934
No, we don't.

702
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:14,700
Okay. Thank you for your cooperation.

703
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:16,967
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

704
00:48:28,166 --> 00:48:29,166
This is Ko Ji-seok.

705
00:48:29,233 --> 00:48:33,200
<i>It's your mother's hospital.
We have your invoice.</i>

706
00:48:34,066 --> 00:48:37,066
So it's 9,270,000 won...

707
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:41,200
I'll let you know
as soon as the money is ready.

708
00:48:41,734 --> 00:48:43,333
<i>It must've been tough for you.</i>

709
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:46,000
<i>But you haven't paid the bills, too.</i>

710
00:48:46,066 --> 00:48:48,467
<i>The administration keeps
telling us to discharge her.</i>

711
00:48:48,934 --> 00:48:52,734
<i>Because we don't have the machine,
it's affecting other patients negatively.</i>

712
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:56,000
<i>You have to pay us
by the end of this week, otherwise...</i>

713
00:48:56,066 --> 00:48:58,834
Yes. I understand.

714
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,266
GOODBYE CASH

715
00:49:14,867 --> 00:49:17,233
REASON : TO INVESTIGATE
CHOI DO-CHEOL'S DISAPPEARANCE

716
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:20,133
Yes. It's not Hodori.

717
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,800
Right. It's the mascot of the police.

718
00:49:21,867 --> 00:49:24,900
Hodori is
from the 1988 sports competition.

719
00:49:24,967 --> 00:49:28,033
This is a cute character of the police.

720
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:29,367
We, police officers, made it.

721
00:49:29,867 --> 00:49:31,767
We're the Subway Police.

722
00:49:31,834 --> 00:49:32,834
PHONE LOG RECEIVED CALL 010-500-2580

723
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:36,033
There's something fishy about this number.

724
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:38,133
I'm not saying that you were there.

725
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:40,200
No. We are the Subway Police.

726
00:49:40,266 --> 00:49:43,800
Is Subway Police a real thing?
Yes, it is a real thing.

727
00:49:43,867 --> 00:49:45,333
-Gosh, sir.
-It's driving me crazy.

728
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,033
Yes. Sure.

729
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:48,266
No, that's not it.

730
00:49:48,333 --> 00:49:51,467
I think we were mistaken. Sorry, goodbye.

731
00:49:51,533 --> 00:49:53,033

734
00:49:58,100 --> 00:49:58,967
Approval...

735
00:49:59,033 --> 00:50:01,433
-Oh, the business is closed?
-Oh, goodness.

736
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,734
Okay, got it. Take care.

737
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:04,633
What?

738
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:06,200
-What?
-Why?

739
00:50:06,734 --> 00:50:08,900
No, it's nothing.

740
00:50:09,533 --> 00:50:10,467
Hey, you...

741
00:50:11,066 --> 00:50:12,233
We're so busy right now.

742
00:50:16,967 --> 00:50:18,867
GOODBYE CASH

743
00:50:18,934 --> 00:50:20,934
OWNER INFORMATION AND CALL LOG
FOR 010-500-2580

744
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:22,834
Loan.

745
00:50:25,934 --> 00:50:26,800
By the way,

746
00:50:27,333 --> 00:50:28,800
don't you need to go make arrests?

747
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:31,633
I was just about to head out.

748
00:50:32,433 --> 00:50:33,934
See you later.

749
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,734
-Hello?
-Goodness.

750
00:50:37,767 --> 00:50:39,200
I want to take out a loan.

751
00:50:39,834 --> 00:50:40,800
Where should I go to?

752
00:50:40,867 --> 00:50:43,567
GOODBYE CASH

753
00:50:46,467 --> 00:50:47,767
I must've gone mad.

754
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:51,734
GOODBYE CASH

755
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:52,900
It doesn't hurt to ask.

756
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:55,300
You bastards.

757
00:50:57,133 --> 00:50:58,567
Also,

758
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,400
you guys gave out flyers
in my jurisdiction first.

759
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,800
This is for the investigation.

760
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:06,734
Right. That's it.

761
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,033
These bastards.

762
00:51:30,934 --> 00:51:33,800
LOAN APPLICATION

763
00:51:33,867 --> 00:51:36,667
TEN MILLION WON

764
00:51:39,533 --> 00:51:43,166
Once you sign the paper,
you'll get the money right away today.

765
00:51:51,333 --> 00:51:54,166
TEN MILLION WON

766
00:51:54,633 --> 00:51:56,800
Because of the walnut cake shop,

767
00:51:56,867 --> 00:51:59,433
everyone's asking us
to lower the interest.

768
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:01,033
What are you going to do?

769
00:52:01,934 --> 00:52:03,767
I told you to take care of it.

770
00:52:09,233 --> 00:52:10,667
I'm sorry.

771
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:36,367
Once you sign this, it's there.

772
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,900
Regard to the legal interest rate, right?

773
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:41,133
Yes.

774
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,533
And no interest
if I pay you back in seven days, right?

775
00:52:47,934 --> 00:52:48,767
What?

776
00:52:49,233 --> 00:52:52,533
It's six million won.
I asked for ten million won.

777
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:56,767
In terms of day loans,
we don't know for sure

778
00:52:56,834 --> 00:52:58,667
if you're able to pay back.

779
00:52:59,166 --> 00:53:01,567
We deduct 10 percent for that risk.

780
00:53:01,633 --> 00:53:05,100
It's 24 percent for future interest.
And 8 percent for cash commission.

781
00:53:05,166 --> 00:53:09,367
Anyway, if you pay back in seven days,
you only need to pay the principal back.

782
00:53:09,433 --> 00:53:10,300
What...

783
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:13,033
But the principal is ten million won.

784
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:13,934
That's right.

785
00:53:17,133 --> 00:53:19,734
You gave me six million,
but I must pay you ten million back?

786
00:53:20,667 --> 00:53:23,100
This is illegal.

787
00:53:23,166 --> 00:53:24,100
Take it or leave it.

788
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:52,867
What is she doing here?

789
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,300
Why is she here?

790
00:54:24,934 --> 00:54:26,433
She's gone nuts again.

791
00:54:39,633 --> 00:54:40,467
Password...

792
00:54:41,433 --> 00:54:42,266
Hey.

793
00:55:07,934 --> 00:55:09,233
Who are you?

794
00:55:17,667 --> 00:55:19,200
Who are you?

795
00:55:20,967 --> 00:55:22,400
I'm here to look for someone.

796
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,433
Mr. Choi Do-cheol's here, right?

797
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:06,533
Oh, I see.

798
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:08,200
There are police officers outside.

799
00:56:09,667 --> 00:56:13,266
Please block off the front door,
the back door, and the exit on the right.

800
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:25,734
You keep looking over here.

801
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:29,533
Did you lock him up in here?

802
00:56:39,533 --> 00:56:40,367
Damn it.

803
00:56:43,166 --> 00:56:44,000
Rookie.

804
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:46,467
Gosh, that bastard.

805
00:56:47,834 --> 00:56:48,767
She's all right.

806
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:56,066
Sir!

807
00:56:57,033 --> 00:56:58,266
Are you okay?

808
00:56:59,233 --> 00:57:00,467
Can you get up?

809
00:57:06,633 --> 00:57:07,467
Sir.

810
00:57:12,166 --> 00:57:14,500
Sir!

811
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:19,734
Mr. Choi!

812
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:21,467
Why are you doing this?

813
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,300
Mr. Choi!

814
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:28,033
Why are you doing this?

815
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:29,734
We found the money!

816
00:57:32,333 --> 00:57:33,233
What?

817
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,233
Oh, my.

818
00:57:39,066 --> 00:57:40,000
Gosh, you scared me.

819
00:57:41,266 --> 00:57:42,133
Hello?

820
00:57:43,133 --> 00:57:44,300
Are you okay?

821
00:57:45,667 --> 00:57:48,567
How could those bastards
lock people up in here?

822
00:57:50,567 --> 00:57:51,400
Hey...

823
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:53,133
Look.

824
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:57,200
Have you been beaten up?

825
00:57:59,433 --> 00:58:01,967
It's okay. I'm a police officer.

826
00:58:03,333 --> 00:58:04,834
Hey.

827
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,433
You are safe now.

828
00:58:10,233 --> 00:58:13,300
Let me see your face. Did you get hurt?

829
00:58:13,367 --> 00:58:16,600
Let me see your face.

830
00:58:22,367 --> 00:58:23,200
Hey.

831
00:58:25,533 --> 00:58:26,367
Excuse me.

832
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:28,300
Hey.

833
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:29,633
Hey!

834
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:33,500
I'm not hurt.

835
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:35,300
I'm fine.

836
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:36,633
Captain.

837
00:58:37,033 --> 00:58:39,300
You're really stubborn.

838
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:42,400
What are you doing here?

839
00:58:42,967 --> 00:58:44,433
I had business here.

840
00:58:44,734 --> 00:58:46,400
Business? Here?

841
00:58:48,033 --> 00:58:49,100
I'm leaving now.

842
00:58:52,166 --> 00:58:53,233
Right, it's locked.

843
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:11,834
What?

844
00:59:12,667 --> 00:59:13,734
Why is there no signal?

845
00:59:15,333 --> 00:59:16,734
LOAN APPLICATION TEN MILLION WON

846
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:19,700
Did you come here to take out a loan?

847
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:23,033
Why?

848
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:25,767
Is something going on?

849
00:59:25,834 --> 00:59:26,667
Well...

850
00:59:29,734 --> 00:59:31,233
I wanted to buy a car.

851
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:33,767
I'm sick of taking the subway.

852
00:59:36,066 --> 00:59:36,900
What?

853
00:59:41,934 --> 00:59:43,133
So what you are saying is...

854
00:59:44,333 --> 00:59:46,967
When the wife asked us

855
00:59:47,033 --> 00:59:50,066
to find her husband with her young son,

856
00:59:50,133 --> 00:59:51,867
you dismissed them so coldly.

857
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,467
I thought you were a man of integrity.

858
00:59:57,533 --> 01:00:00,934
Now I know
that you are nothing but selfish.

859
01:00:01,567 --> 01:00:02,900
That's rich coming from you.

860
01:00:03,467 --> 01:00:06,166
I'm going to get penalized because of you.

861
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:08,967
You don't even care whether
others get punished or not.

862
01:00:09,033 --> 01:00:10,800
Who is the real selfish one here?

863
01:00:13,934 --> 01:00:16,433
It's for the better.

864
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:19,266
You hate working with me, and so do I.

865
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:22,667
-I've never said I hate it.
-We have different paths to take.

866
01:00:22,734 --> 01:00:24,734
We shouldn't have boarded
the same ship to begin with.

867
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:31,266
After we get out here, get off my ship.

868
01:00:31,934 --> 01:00:34,767
-Let's go our separate ways.
-The Subway Police is where I belong.

869
01:00:36,333 --> 01:00:37,467
Are you okay?

870
01:00:38,467 --> 01:00:39,967
You're standing in my way.

871
01:00:40,033 --> 01:00:41,367
Stick to the wall.

872
01:00:55,667 --> 01:00:56,500
Hello.

873
01:00:56,967 --> 01:01:00,066
Oh, my. Is the screen all right?

874
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:05,367
-What a wonderful family.
-Thank...

875
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:07,734
Thank you.

876
01:01:32,033 --> 01:01:33,734
You like taking the subway.

877
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:34,700
But why are you here?

878
01:01:35,266 --> 01:01:36,333
What are you doing here?

879
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:42,200
Be honest. You want to do
violent crime cases, don't you?

880
01:01:43,333 --> 01:01:44,900
Your heart beats
for violent crimes, right?

881
01:01:45,834 --> 01:01:48,633
You feel responsible
for catching bad guys.

882
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:51,300
You get excited like you're
a heroine in a superhero movie.

883
01:01:51,934 --> 01:01:53,467
-Stop it.
-But...

884
01:01:54,633 --> 01:01:56,333
The reality is not like in movies.

885
01:01:56,734 --> 01:01:59,100
If you act before you think,
you end up like this.

886
01:02:00,467 --> 01:02:03,100
-I'm not doing this because I'm excited.
-Then what is it?

887
01:02:04,333 --> 01:02:06,500
Do you want to get promoted?

888
01:02:07,533 --> 01:02:08,533
The reason why I'm...

889
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:20,567
Boss, I've come to pick up flyers.

890
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:28,867
Can I just take them?

891
01:02:44,834 --> 01:02:47,367
Please open it. Please.

892
01:02:48,066 --> 01:02:50,900
They always go to play golf.

893
01:02:51,533 --> 01:02:53,734
Wouldn't it hurt to do
fun things together?

894
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:55,300
They only make me run errands.

895
01:02:59,533 --> 01:03:01,734
-What?
-Get up. Give me your hand.

896
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:03,567
The other hand.

897
01:03:04,033 --> 01:03:05,233
-Who are you?
-Good job.

898
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:06,467
It hurts, right?

899
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:14,133
Captain!

900
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:15,367
I'M SORRY PLEASE TAKE CARE OF JI-HWAN

901
01:03:15,433 --> 01:03:16,400
It's a suicide note.

902
01:03:42,533 --> 01:03:43,900
CATCH THE GHOST

903
01:03:44,333 --> 01:03:46,367
<i>I've tried my best to survive.</i>

904
01:03:46,433 --> 01:03:47,834
<i>But this is how my life ends.</i>

905
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:49,066
<i>No, Mr. Choi.</i>

906
01:03:49,133 --> 01:03:50,400
I will end it here.

907
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:52,266
Don't!

908
01:03:52,333 --> 01:03:54,200
<i>Don't you want to join the RIU?</i>

909
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:56,667
<i>I haven't changed.</i>

910
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:58,533
<i>I'm still the same, Ma-ri.</i>

911
01:03:58,767 --> 01:03:59,600
Mom!

912
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:03,033
I don't know where I am now.

913
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:03,967
What?

914
01:04:04,266 --> 01:04:06,700
<i>I think someone was there.</i>

915
01:04:07,066 --> 01:04:09,066
<i>Is someone hiding in the station?</i>

916
01:04:09,433 --> 01:04:11,500
<i>Could it have been the Subway Ghost?</i>
