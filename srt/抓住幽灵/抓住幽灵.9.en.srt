The Grasshoppers have raided a
train passing Wangsoori Station.

(Previously on Catch the Ghost)

5
00:00:27,741 --> 00:00:29,215
Those punks are here again.

6
00:00:29,441 --> 00:00:30,616
Chief.

7
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,525
Park Jung Hoon!
I told you to stop messing around.

8
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:40,995
Mine. That's mine!

9
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,696
- Mine! Mine!
- I told you to stop.

10
00:00:43,081 --> 00:00:45,489
You make my life miserable.

11
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:46,565
I'm scared.

12
00:00:47,821 --> 00:00:49,966
I have your son.

13
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:53,705
If you want your son back,
I want 100,000 dollars.

14
00:00:54,901 --> 00:00:56,006
No.

15
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:59,230
Chief, you know how things work
underground better than anyone.

16
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:00,476
Let's help them.

17
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:03,315
I need to go catch the Grasshoppers.

18
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:06,286
You filmed their
performance for a full hour?

19
00:01:06,711 --> 00:01:08,256
the Grasshoppers stole the phone.

20
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,185
Then we need to catch
the Grasshoppers first.

21
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:14,396
Hurry.

22
00:01:14,851 --> 00:01:16,055
- Sorry.
- For what?

23
00:01:22,661 --> 00:01:23,805
What was that?

24
00:01:24,461 --> 00:01:25,566
Hey!

25
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:28,036
Stop right there!

26
00:01:34,901 --> 00:01:35,976
Fine.

27
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,616
I was wrong.

28
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,185
I was wrong!

29
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:48,926
I lived only for you.

30
00:01:51,551 --> 00:01:54,465
I wanted to live my own life too.

31
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,575
Sorry.

32
00:02:04,071 --> 00:02:07,476
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

33
00:02:08,741 --> 00:02:09,876
Please.

34
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,515
"I was wrong."

35
00:02:19,481 --> 00:02:21,355
"I wanted to live my own life"?

36
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,895
Please.

37
00:02:32,331 --> 00:02:33,506
Chief.

38
00:02:37,171 --> 00:02:38,276
Whatever.

39
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:41,145
Why are you doing this to me?

40
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,015
We almost had the Grasshoppers.

41
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,485
We could've chased them first,

42
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,355
and handed the garbage
truck over to Major Crimes.

43
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,585
I can't do it anymore.

44
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:55,496
Either you leave the
Subway Police or I will...

45
00:02:58,290 --> 00:02:59,365
I mean...

46
00:03:01,961 --> 00:03:04,906
You're the one who messed up.
Why do you keep crying?

47
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,876
It's not like Jung Hoon died.

48
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,346
Do you think I'm like this
because I'm heartless?

49
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,756
Anyway, I came here.

50
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,395
I found it!

51
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,335
Found it!

52
00:04:08,861 --> 00:04:10,135
I found it!

53
00:04:14,401 --> 00:04:16,301
The cell phone! Yes!

54
00:04:16,301 --> 00:04:17,746
- Yes!
- We found it!

55
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,575
Yes!

56
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,006
Leave already. Let me run my business.

57
00:04:44,491 --> 00:04:45,591
Sir.

58
00:04:45,591 --> 00:04:50,106
With kidnapping, we must find them
even without the parent's consent.

59
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,106
Gosh.

60
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,645
- Chief Ko...
- Detective Ko.

61
00:04:58,341 --> 00:04:59,840
You found it?

62
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:01,616
The kidnapper was caught on this.

63
00:05:05,481 --> 00:05:06,655
But...

64
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,095
(Connecting to USB)

65
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,645
Mister.

66
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,876
Jung Hoon followed the kidnapper willingly.

67
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:31,746
I think he knows her.

68
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:42,950
I don't know her.

69
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,221
If you don't cooperate,

70
00:05:44,221 --> 00:05:47,566
we'll arrest you for child
abuse, so look carefully.

71
00:05:52,661 --> 00:05:54,060
I don't remember her.

72
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,801
Keep watching until you do!

73
00:05:55,801 --> 00:05:57,570
What's your problem, woman?

74
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,471
Why don't you both stop?

75
00:05:59,471 --> 00:06:02,246
- Fine.
- It says something here.

76
00:06:05,671 --> 00:06:07,356
Eve Sculpting School?

77
00:06:08,111 --> 00:06:11,126
Look for Eve Sculpting School in Seoul.

78
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,126
There's a lot of Eves.

79
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,281
There are six in the search results alone.

80
00:06:16,281 --> 00:06:19,450
Officer Lee. Look for videos of
where she came from and went,

81
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:21,621
and find out which turnstiles she used...

82
00:06:21,621 --> 00:06:23,390
to get the history of
her transportation card.

83
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,635
Yes, sir.

84
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:28,075
Once you do,
we can find out where she got off.

85
00:06:28,301 --> 00:06:31,705
I'm sure Eve Sculpting School is near there.

86
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,936
Now,

87
00:07:01,101 --> 00:07:03,135
it's time to part ways.

88
00:07:04,301 --> 00:07:05,606
I'm scared.

89
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,546
I'm scared.

90
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,515
I'm scared.

91
00:07:15,481 --> 00:07:17,885
Chief, I checked her card history.

92
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,981
She got on at Wangsoori and off at Hapjeong.

93
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,655
Hapjeong Station.

94
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,926
There's an Eve Sculpting
School at Hapjeong Station.

95
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:27,635
Okay, let's get over there.

96
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,655
You don't need to go with us.

97
00:07:49,781 --> 00:07:52,926
Our people are waiting above.

98
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,955
There's no room in the car either.

99
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,965
It's fine. We have our own vehicle.

100
00:07:58,051 --> 00:08:00,020
It's a scooter,
so it's good when there's traffic.

101
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,335
A scooter?

102
00:08:01,921 --> 00:08:05,091
We'll handle it from here, okay?

103
00:08:05,091 --> 00:08:06,736
It's really fine.

104
00:08:07,101 --> 00:08:09,200
Police officers should help
out in times like these.

105
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,345
Okay. Thank you.

106
00:08:11,931 --> 00:08:13,100
Chief.

107
00:08:13,101 --> 00:08:15,845
Chief. Chief. Why?

108
00:08:16,171 --> 00:08:17,440
They're trying to claim the case.

109
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,041
Since whoever puts the
cuffs on get the case.

110
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,246
What?

111
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:24,285
Who cares who handles the
case in this situation?

112
00:08:24,911 --> 00:08:26,126
I'm going.

113
00:08:28,281 --> 00:08:29,955
You've done all you could.

114
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,735
(Eve Sculpting School)

115
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,316
Darn it.

116
00:08:50,611 --> 00:08:52,085
Where did she go?

117
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,951
Yes. I'm going now.

118
00:08:57,951 --> 00:09:00,821
I'm giving you a chance only
because you lost the cops.

119
00:09:00,821 --> 00:09:03,581
If you lose my trust again,
I won't give you another chance.

120
00:09:03,581 --> 00:09:04,821
Don't worry.

121
00:09:04,821 --> 00:09:07,091
I did as you said from the start.

122
00:09:07,091 --> 00:09:09,760
You said to kick out the
cops, so I told them to leave.

123
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,105
And I told you that they
went to the art school.

124
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:17,676
My son Jung Hoon is safe, right?

125
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,371
Hapjeong Station, toward Gimpo Airport.

126
00:09:19,371 --> 00:09:22,146
Platform 2-3 at 5pm on the dot.

127
00:09:22,701 --> 00:09:24,670
If you're a second late,
you'll never see your son again.

128
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:28,656
Okay. I got it. Thank you. Thank you.

129
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:40,365
The train is approaching the station.

130
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,835
Please watch your step.

131
00:09:51,071 --> 00:09:52,806
Please be careful of the opening doors.

132
00:09:54,201 --> 00:09:55,646
Mr. Park.

133
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,946
Where's Jung Hoon?

134
00:10:00,211 --> 00:10:01,916
I'll tell you after you give me that.

135
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,981
Return him to me first.

136
00:10:04,981 --> 00:10:07,255
If this door closes,
you won't get another chance.

137
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,495
Return him to me first.

138
00:10:25,471 --> 00:10:27,176
Jung Hoon.

139
00:10:38,851 --> 00:10:40,225
Jung Hoon.

140
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,556
Jung Hoon!

141
00:10:43,451 --> 00:10:44,696
Jung Hoon!

142
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,475
(Priority seating for pregnant women)

143
00:11:14,221 --> 00:11:15,926
Whose is that?

144
00:11:17,591 --> 00:11:20,296
Why won't they pick up?

145
00:11:24,491 --> 00:11:25,666
(Officer Yoo Ryung)

146
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,255
You should answer if the phone rings.

147
00:11:43,841 --> 00:11:45,255
Let go!

148
00:11:45,851 --> 00:11:47,225
Oh my gosh.

149
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,266
Let go!

150
00:11:59,491 --> 00:12:02,676
This is the end. The end of your life.

151
00:12:12,371 --> 00:12:13,711
So,

152
00:12:13,711 --> 00:12:16,380
when the Major Crimes officers
went to catch the kidnapper,

153
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,585
you put this in the bag?

154
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,196
- Okay, let's get over there.
- Okay.

155
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,875
My hands are so quick, aren't they?

156
00:12:41,601 --> 00:12:42,701
But...

157
00:12:42,701 --> 00:12:47,755
how did you know Mr. Park
would go to see this woman?

158
00:12:48,311 --> 00:12:50,955
I saw Mr. Park and Jung Hoon for two years.

159
00:12:51,581 --> 00:12:54,056
He may have yelled at him,

160
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,825
but he never looked down on him.

161
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:00,666
He responded to everything
Jung Hoon did and taught him.

162
00:13:01,121 --> 00:13:03,266
And when he got frustrated, he got angry.

163
00:13:04,331 --> 00:13:06,505
That was all because he loved him.

164
00:13:07,601 --> 00:13:09,036
That's how I knew...

165
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,676
he'd never give up on Jung Hoon.

166
00:13:16,471 --> 00:13:17,886
Mr. Park...

167
00:13:18,571 --> 00:13:21,016
must be so happy to see Jung Hoon again.

168
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,995
Thanks.

169
00:13:34,061 --> 00:13:35,266
Hold on.

170
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:38,536
I put this one on,

171
00:13:38,691 --> 00:13:41,505
and our chief put this one on.

172
00:13:42,601 --> 00:13:43,760
You know, right?

173
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,800
The case goes to the person who
puts the handcuffs on first.

174
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,670
Then why did you call us?

175
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:51,010
We don't have a holding cell.

176
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,786
We'll interrogate her later.

177
00:13:53,371 --> 00:13:54,656
Okay, then.

178
00:13:54,941 --> 00:13:56,656
Watch her well for us.

179
00:14:06,351 --> 00:14:07,495
Yes, Officer Lee.

180
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:11,436
Jung Hoon?

181
00:14:30,481 --> 00:14:33,755
He followed her because
of the art school sign.

182
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,825
He wants to become a sculptor,

183
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:40,125
but I didn't buy anything for him.

184
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,595
I'm sorry I misunderstood.

185
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:47,105
I had no idea you were being threatened.

186
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:53,245
You didn't misunderstand.

187
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,946
It's true I find him...

188
00:14:57,841 --> 00:14:59,146
to be a burden.

189
00:15:00,981 --> 00:15:03,085
I sometimes run out of breath in my sleep.

190
00:15:04,211 --> 00:15:05,855
When I die,

191
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,556
how will my son live by himself?

192
00:15:10,221 --> 00:15:11,495
I want him to die...

193
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,835
the day I die.

194
00:15:15,991 --> 00:15:18,536
That's my prayer every night.

195
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,975
What happened to Jung Hoon...

196
00:15:26,371 --> 00:15:27,615
is all my fault.

197
00:15:31,871 --> 00:15:33,316
It's not your fault.

198
00:15:37,211 --> 00:15:39,085
Taking care of a sick family member alone...

199
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,396
is like running a marathon
with no finish line.

200
00:15:43,481 --> 00:15:44,995
Even when you're out of breath,

201
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:48,136
no one can take your place.

202
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,436
You can't stop running either.

203
00:15:55,361 --> 00:15:58,345
In the end, you came back.

204
00:16:00,231 --> 00:16:03,245
You're ready to run harder for Jung Hoon.

205
00:16:05,571 --> 00:16:07,886
I will cheer you on.

206
00:16:11,581 --> 00:16:13,125
Thank you, Chief.

207
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,556
We saved him together.

208
00:16:21,091 --> 00:16:22,196
Jung Hoon.

209
00:16:23,121 --> 00:16:24,235
Jung Hoon.

210
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,266
My baby.

211
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:28,806
I bet you were frightened.

212
00:16:30,061 --> 00:16:31,475
Dad...

213
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:33,776
Yes.

214
00:16:35,601 --> 00:16:36,946
Jung Hoon.

215
00:16:38,111 --> 00:16:40,186
If you show this to your dad,

216
00:16:40,241 --> 00:16:42,556
I bet he'll smile everyday.

217
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,755
Can I give it to him?

218
00:17:27,591 --> 00:17:28,735
Thank you.

219
00:17:29,821 --> 00:17:30,965
Thank you.

220
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,366
I'm sorry I'm returning it so late.

221
00:18:04,121 --> 00:18:06,761
Evidence of a major crime case
was recorded with the performance.

222
00:18:06,761 --> 00:18:08,775
I had to get Major Crimes
to review it first.

223
00:18:09,061 --> 00:18:11,930
I could've gone to your office tomorrow.
Thank you.

224
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:13,545
Of course, I should bring it to you.

225
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:18,785
Then...

226
00:18:31,351 --> 00:18:32,420
What do I do?

227
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,626
(Don Na, I'm sorry but are
you free tomorrow at 3pm?)

228
00:18:40,091 --> 00:18:41,975
(Ma Don Na)

229
00:18:45,101 --> 00:18:46,376
Why won't he pick up?

230
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:14,505
Jackson?

231
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,106
Don Na...

232
00:19:18,271 --> 00:19:19,775
Why didn't you tell me?

233
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:45,890
You! I heard you let the Grasshopper
go when you almost had him.

234
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:47,136
I'm sorry.

235
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,031
Don't you know what the Grasshoppers did?

236
00:19:51,031 --> 00:19:55,400
The Grasshoppers stole my wallet.
I, Kim Hyung Ja,

237
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,846
am the commissioner who can easily fire you.

238
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:03,656
Good work.

239
00:20:05,351 --> 00:20:07,581
If you went to catch the Grasshopper...

240
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,150
instead of the kid who was kidnapped,

241
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:11,025
I would've really fired you.

242
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,096
I had them hold off on taking
disciplinary action for now.

243
00:20:15,561 --> 00:20:18,606
We can't punish a police
officer who saved a kid's life.

244
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,436
Thank you, Madam Commissioner.

245
00:20:22,831 --> 00:20:25,331
How did they find out
about Seolleung Station?

246
00:20:25,331 --> 00:20:27,470
That's not important.

247
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:30,140
We were supposed to pass over
the goods at Seolleung Station.

248
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,646
Shoot.

249
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:33,646
We could've earned enough...

250
00:20:34,071 --> 00:20:35,880
to spend a whole month at the bar.

251
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,715
The problem is...

252
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:43,295
that the police know our faces now.

253
00:20:45,551 --> 00:20:48,096
- What are we going to do?
- Dong Man.

254
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:55,235
I should send you somewhere so
you could learn your manners.

255
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:59,275
You keep on losing your
temper towards your elders.

256
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,876
I'll look for a solution.

257
00:21:08,611 --> 00:21:10,985
Just... Just sit.

258
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:36,015
Is she not going home,
or is she not allowed?

259
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,086
I'm back.

260
00:21:46,251 --> 00:21:48,156
Can't they just get past that divider?

261
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,826
- Chief.
- Hey.

262
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,926
That's the bag the Grasshoppers
used for stolen goods, right?

263
00:21:54,051 --> 00:21:56,521
Yes. Please get it tested for DNA.

264
00:21:56,521 --> 00:21:57,735
Okay.

265
00:21:58,361 --> 00:22:02,235
This handle is perfect to get
fingerprint readings from.

266
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,775
We have them now.

267
00:22:04,301 --> 00:22:05,505
Also,

268
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:08,946
they'll hold off on my disciplinary action.

269
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,846
- Really?
- Really?

270
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:12,815
Congratulations!

271
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:16,386
That's the same thing as
getting an exemption, isn't it?

272
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:20,686
Well, they haven't set a new date,

273
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,455
so they'll likely forget about it.

274
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:26,025
We're finally seeing some rays of hope.

275
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,061
We'll head over to the
National Forensic Service.

276
00:22:31,061 --> 00:22:32,159
Good.

277
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,361
Okay, let's go.
Should we take the scooter, Dad?

278
00:22:33,361 --> 00:22:35,331
Hey. You have Don Na now.

279
00:22:35,331 --> 00:22:37,001
- Don't touch me.
- Come on.

280
00:22:37,001 --> 00:22:38,531
- See you later.
- Okay.

281
00:22:38,531 --> 00:22:39,775
- Bye!
- Bye!

282
00:22:44,341 --> 00:22:48,616
(Investigation Team 1)

283
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:57,856
Commissioner Kim praised you too.

284
00:23:00,591 --> 00:23:02,565
- I see.
- Yes.

285
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:08,601
The suspect who abducted an
autistic man named Park...

286
00:23:08,601 --> 00:23:11,406
was arrested just six
hours after the abduction.

287
00:23:11,571 --> 00:23:14,001
Hwang, who was struggling
with credit card debt...

288
00:23:14,001 --> 00:23:15,740
heard about Park's
installment savings account...

289
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:18,841
at the bakery on her way to work.

290
00:23:18,841 --> 00:23:22,715
She planned the crime against Park's son.

291
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,650
- Credit card debt?
- The victim...

292
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:27,611
temporarily lost consciousness
due to tranquilizer overdose,

293
00:23:27,611 --> 00:23:30,051
but he regained consciousness
just two hours later.

294
00:23:30,051 --> 00:23:32,220
Thank goodness Jung Hoon woke up.

295
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,791
33-year-old Hwang who was
arrested by the police...

296
00:23:34,791 --> 00:23:37,390
- had a debt of 60,000 dollars,
- If something happened to him,

297
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:39,261
and claimed that she committed
the crime on impulse.

298
00:23:39,261 --> 00:23:42,430
Jung Hoon's father wouldn't
have a life anymore.

299
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:44,601
Hwang waited until Park was absent...

300
00:23:44,601 --> 00:23:46,975
before she lured the victim around 2pm...

301
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,275
If the police look the other way,

302
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,616
the victim's family...

303
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,356
will be tormented all their lives.

304
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,116
I was wrong.

305
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:00,856
I was wrong!

306
00:24:03,121 --> 00:24:05,326
I lived only for you.

307
00:24:07,291 --> 00:24:08,995
Sorry.

308
00:24:11,061 --> 00:24:12,836
I'm sorry.

309
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:19,505
Ryung.

310
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:21,876
Yes?

311
00:24:22,001 --> 00:24:24,146
I'm asking out of curiosity.

312
00:24:25,771 --> 00:24:28,955
Did one of your family members...

313
00:24:33,111 --> 00:24:34,555
Did someone in your family...

314
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:40,751
(New voice message)

315
00:24:40,751 --> 00:24:42,265
I keep getting these.

316
00:24:42,791 --> 00:24:46,265
I want to keep being your partner.

317
00:24:47,091 --> 00:24:48,505
I want...

318
00:24:50,061 --> 00:24:52,745
to stay by your side.

319
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:55,416
Wait.

320
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:57,346
What?

321
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,785
Don't check it.

322
00:25:01,371 --> 00:25:02,656
Why not?

323
00:25:07,351 --> 00:25:08,656
It's voice phishing.

324
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,281
They sent out an official document.

325
00:25:10,281 --> 00:25:12,250
If you click it,
it'll charge you 500 dollars.

326
00:25:12,251 --> 00:25:13,890
There is no such thing.

327
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:16,090
It's a new kind of fraud.

328
00:25:16,091 --> 00:25:18,636
I think it erases all of your contacts too.

329
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:19,936
Really?

330
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,535
If you don't trust me,

331
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:26,545
you should click it.

332
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,545
Did you listen?

333
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,010
Oh no.

334
00:25:36,011 --> 00:25:38,525
I'll take this to the bathroom
and dry it right away.

335
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:52,106
I erased it.

336
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:54,005
That was close. Thank you.

337
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:55,606
It's nothing.

338
00:25:56,331 --> 00:25:57,936

to help you wake up.

368
00:28:40,956 --> 00:28:42,726
- What?
- Grab his jacket.

369
00:28:42,726 --> 00:28:43,956
- Okay.
- What?

370
00:28:43,956 --> 00:28:46,700
- Gosh.
- Am I glad to see you.

371
00:28:47,296 --> 00:28:49,595
- Hey. Watch it.
- Who do you think you are?

372
00:28:49,595 --> 00:28:50,966
- Mister.
- Let go!

373
00:28:50,966 --> 00:28:53,036
- You...
- No, no, Mister.

374
00:28:53,036 --> 00:28:55,006
Okay, okay.

375
00:28:55,006 --> 00:28:56,736
Stop talking casually to us.

376
00:28:56,736 --> 00:28:58,035
We're police officers.

377
00:28:58,036 --> 00:28:59,381
Giddy-up!

378
00:28:59,575 --> 00:29:00,650
- A horse?
- Giddy-up!

379
00:29:16,925 --> 00:29:19,041
I enjoy this time the most.

380
00:29:20,966 --> 00:29:23,841
Taking a night train
while crossing over water.

381
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:26,740
It feels like I'm getting complimented.

382
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:30,276
I've been knocked down by people all day.

383
00:29:30,276 --> 00:29:33,420
It feels like I'm being
acknowledged for the hard work.

384
00:29:34,675 --> 00:29:38,690
I diligently rode on the subway all day,

385
00:29:39,686 --> 00:29:41,861
so it's finally giving me
a beautiful night view...

386
00:29:42,956 --> 00:29:44,761
as a reward.

387
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:56,601
(Wangsoori Station)

388
00:30:57,726 --> 00:30:59,726
You looked really tired.

389
00:30:59,726 --> 00:31:02,041
Your neck was tilting back like this.

390
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:05,611
Let's go straight home from here.

391
00:31:06,206 --> 00:31:08,236
Yes, sir. Take care.

392
00:31:08,236 --> 00:31:10,281
- I will. Goodnight.
- Bye.

393
00:31:18,046 --> 00:31:21,321
Hey, Mi Hyun. What are you doing?

394
00:31:28,355 --> 00:31:32,226
You asked me last time if I have a son,

395
00:31:32,226 --> 00:31:34,900
so I thought you were a strange person.

396
00:31:35,196 --> 00:31:36,470
I'm sorry.

397
00:31:37,335 --> 00:31:39,811
I asked you instead of
telling you that I have a son.

398
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:43,750
You must have a son.

399
00:31:43,806 --> 00:31:46,821
How old is he? What does he do?

400
00:31:56,186 --> 00:31:57,631
My son...

401
00:31:59,625 --> 00:32:01,660
suffers from a broken heart.

402
00:32:02,526 --> 00:32:05,301
That's why I work here.

403
00:32:06,895 --> 00:32:08,541
Myung Chul.

404
00:32:10,365 --> 00:32:12,041
Did you buy some egg bread for me?

405
00:32:12,736 --> 00:32:15,311
- Ta-da.
- Gosh.

406
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:19,920
You have to sleep soon, so eat just one.

407
00:32:20,075 --> 00:32:21,420
- Okay.
- Good.

408
00:32:22,345 --> 00:32:27,016
Sweetie, I really like the new caretaker.

409
00:32:27,016 --> 00:32:29,591
Look. She can braid hair really well.

410
00:32:29,815 --> 00:32:33,085
Let me see. You're not kidding.

411
00:32:33,085 --> 00:32:34,585
Are you a queen?

412
00:32:34,585 --> 00:32:37,500
Where's your crown?

413
00:32:38,966 --> 00:32:42,111
There it is. It was there.

414
00:32:46,865 --> 00:32:49,075
Hey, eat slowly.

415
00:32:49,075 --> 00:32:51,311
- I'll bring you some water.
- Okay.

416
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:03,561
I can take it for her.

417
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:05,801
Not at all.

418
00:33:06,726 --> 00:33:07,861
But...

419
00:33:09,226 --> 00:33:12,040
you're a detective, right? In Major Crimes?

420
00:33:13,666 --> 00:33:15,241
I'm in the Subway Police.

421
00:33:16,496 --> 00:33:17,710
Subway.

422
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:22,080
If you're in the Subway Police,

423
00:33:22,306 --> 00:33:26,281
you must investigate the
Subway Serial Murders too.

424
00:33:26,445 --> 00:33:28,750
No, that's not us.

425
00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:33,020
You should go.

426
00:33:33,385 --> 00:33:36,091
You may leave early once I come.

427
00:33:36,655 --> 00:33:38,655
Okay. Goodbye.

428
00:33:38,655 --> 00:33:39,801
Thank you.

429
00:34:16,126 --> 00:34:17,201
Chief...

430
00:34:17,356 --> 00:34:19,465
- Should we go left?
- Chief...

431
00:34:19,465 --> 00:34:22,095
- Right turn.
- Should we go right?

432
00:34:22,095 --> 00:34:23,536
Left.

433
00:34:23,536 --> 00:34:26,940
Let's go left. Here we go.

434
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:29,681
Isn't he so handsome?

435
00:34:30,536 --> 00:34:31,611
Hey.

436
00:34:32,845 --> 00:34:34,020
He's back.

437
00:34:34,905 --> 00:34:36,945
What a waste.
She gave birth to a handsome son,

438
00:34:36,945 --> 00:34:38,891
but she doesn't recognize him.

439
00:34:39,385 --> 00:34:40,560
She doesn't recognize...

440
00:34:41,445 --> 00:34:42,661
Chief?

441
00:34:43,215 --> 00:34:46,301
So he's the chief you talked about?

442
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,730
What a small world.

443
00:34:51,755 --> 00:34:56,396
Anyway, your chief struggled so
much, paying for the hospital...

444
00:34:56,396 --> 00:34:58,411
and a caretaker all by himself.

445
00:34:59,106 --> 00:35:02,281
His mother caused trouble
big time not long ago too.

446
00:35:02,735 --> 00:35:04,710
I don't know how he paid for that?

447
00:35:06,405 --> 00:35:09,491
Chief, did you come here to get a loan?

448
00:35:10,175 --> 00:35:11,816
I'm trying to buy a car.

449
00:35:11,816 --> 00:35:15,060
I'm sick of riding the subway.

450
00:35:15,485 --> 00:35:18,186
When the wife came with
her young child in hand...

451
00:35:18,186 --> 00:35:19,755
to beg us to find her husband,

452
00:35:19,755 --> 00:35:21,385
you turned her away so coldly.

453
00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:24,870
I thought you were a
man of your own beliefs.

454
00:35:24,896 --> 00:35:28,370
But it turns out you're totally selfish.

455
00:35:40,775 --> 00:35:41,881
Chief.

456
00:35:45,686 --> 00:35:47,391
Are you going somewhere?

457
00:35:48,316 --> 00:35:50,091
Me? Home. Home.

458
00:35:52,155 --> 00:35:53,155
You?

459
00:35:53,155 --> 00:35:55,730
I met up with a friend and am heading home.

460
00:35:56,255 --> 00:35:58,301
- Do you want a ride?
- No, no.

461
00:35:59,695 --> 00:36:02,141
- I'm fine.
- Get on.

462
00:36:02,836 --> 00:36:04,666
- Where do you live?
- No, no.

463
00:36:04,666 --> 00:36:06,635
Get on. Hurry.

464
00:36:06,635 --> 00:36:08,141
Well...

465
00:36:09,106 --> 00:36:10,810
I have work left to do.

466
00:36:11,706 --> 00:36:13,781
Take me to the office then.

467
00:36:20,715 --> 00:36:22,431
(Slowly)

468
00:36:30,825 --> 00:36:32,701
I think you made a wrong turn.

469
00:36:34,396 --> 00:36:36,241
We'll take the scenic route.

470
00:36:37,766 --> 00:36:39,440
Where are we going now?

471
00:36:40,766 --> 00:36:42,650
We're almost there.

472
00:36:42,775 --> 00:36:46,080
I'm really tired today, that's why.

473
00:36:47,606 --> 00:36:49,250
I won't take you anywhere weird.

474
00:36:52,586 --> 00:36:54,460
Chief, look!

475
00:37:36,195 --> 00:37:39,170
The moon looks the biggest
here in all of Seoul.

476
00:37:39,996 --> 00:37:41,241
You're right.

477
00:37:43,836 --> 00:37:45,810
I come here whenever I feel down.

478
00:37:47,936 --> 00:37:50,011
Sometimes, the moon is cut in half,

479
00:37:51,806 --> 00:37:54,080
and sometimes, it's too cloudy to see it,

480
00:37:56,476 --> 00:37:58,620
but when it's like this,

481
00:37:59,086 --> 00:38:02,261
it makes me happy like I won a raffle.

482
00:38:02,516 --> 00:38:03,631
You're right.

483
00:38:04,556 --> 00:38:05,661
It does.

484
00:38:07,456 --> 00:38:08,600
But...

485
00:38:09,556 --> 00:38:13,540
I never came here after
joining the Subway Police.

486
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:17,940
Why not?

487
00:38:18,795 --> 00:38:20,111
Because you were too busy?

488
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:22,750
Well,

489
00:38:24,836 --> 00:38:27,321
I don't think I need to.

490
00:38:37,755 --> 00:38:40,500
I guess I called you
back so I could see this.

491
00:38:41,786 --> 00:38:42,900
What?

492
00:38:45,295 --> 00:38:46,370
Nothing.

493
00:39:19,166 --> 00:39:22,841
(Wangsoori Station)

494
00:39:22,896 --> 00:39:25,806
- You have to make it quick. Okay?
- Okay.

495
00:39:25,806 --> 00:39:26,905
- Ready?
- Now?

496
00:39:26,905 --> 00:39:29,275
Okay. Hold tightly with your right hand,

497
00:39:29,275 --> 00:39:30,551
and push.

498
00:39:34,376 --> 00:39:35,545
Nice.

499
00:39:35,545 --> 00:39:38,876
Newbie. You should do that
only in dangerous situations.

500
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:39,960
Yes, sir.

501
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:43,190
- Okay.
- Excuse me.

502
00:39:43,615 --> 00:39:45,730
(Detective Kim Woo Hyuk)

503
00:39:46,825 --> 00:39:48,201
Hello, Detective Kim.

504
00:39:48,755 --> 00:39:49,900
Woo Hyuk?

505
00:39:51,425 --> 00:39:53,741
Yes. I'll go now.

506
00:39:55,325 --> 00:39:56,536
I need to step out.

507
00:39:56,536 --> 00:39:58,841
We're going to have
something good for dinner.

508
00:40:00,135 --> 00:40:01,666
I'll be back soon. Wait for me.

509
00:40:01,666 --> 00:40:03,580
We have to stand in line, so we can't wait.

510
00:40:04,836 --> 00:40:07,250
- I'll be right back.
- But...

511
00:40:09,316 --> 00:40:11,016
I'll look for a restaurant.

512
00:40:11,016 --> 00:40:12,916
- One where you have to line up.
- Okay.

513
00:40:12,916 --> 00:40:14,761
I already found a place.

514
00:40:14,916 --> 00:40:15,956
Sure.

515
00:40:15,956 --> 00:40:17,060
Hey...

516
00:40:21,425 --> 00:40:22,531
Ryung.

517
00:40:24,396 --> 00:40:25,500
Detective Kim.

518
00:40:26,195 --> 00:40:27,540
What's up?

519
00:40:27,666 --> 00:40:31,241
I found out something about
that locked door in the tunnel.

520
00:40:31,536 --> 00:40:32,641
What?

521
00:40:36,936 --> 00:40:39,350
(Change in Subway Route for the Line 3)

522
00:40:42,845 --> 00:40:43,845
(Change in Subway Route for the Line 3)

523
00:40:43,845 --> 00:40:45,091
30 years ago,

524
00:40:45,175 --> 00:40:48,091
there was a plan to bring Line
Three to Wangsoori Station.

525
00:40:49,056 --> 00:40:50,161
Really?

526
00:40:50,456 --> 00:40:52,755
The plan got changed with
the change in government,

527
00:40:52,755 --> 00:40:54,460
but the tunnels were already dug.

528
00:40:56,556 --> 00:40:57,755
I think everyone buried it...

529
00:40:57,755 --> 00:40:59,965
because they spent all that
money but it was changed...

530
00:40:59,965 --> 00:41:01,741
just because someone high up said so.

531
00:41:02,166 --> 00:41:03,911
I think that's why no one knew about it.

532
00:41:04,266 --> 00:41:06,306
If they finished digging the tunnel...

533
00:41:06,306 --> 00:41:08,741
That means Line Three can
come into Wangsoori Station.

534
00:41:09,036 --> 00:41:10,350
You were right.

535
00:41:10,836 --> 00:41:15,480
It's totally possible that he moved
the bodies through the tunnel.

536
00:41:18,816 --> 00:41:19,920
Ryung,

537
00:41:20,885 --> 00:41:21,991
are you okay?

538
00:41:24,016 --> 00:41:25,460
Do you think Jin...

539
00:41:27,755 --> 00:41:29,431
was also moved through the tunnel?

540
00:41:30,825 --> 00:41:32,870
You don't think she's somewhere
in the tunnel, do you?

541
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:35,911
Ryung.

542
00:41:36,766 --> 00:41:37,870
We're almost there.

543
00:41:38,865 --> 00:41:40,480
Once we open that door...

544
00:41:41,135 --> 00:41:43,080
and confirm it connects to Line Three,

545
00:41:44,436 --> 00:41:46,520
we can request an official
investigation by Metro.

546
00:41:46,845 --> 00:41:50,091
Then we can find your sister.

547
00:41:55,916 --> 00:41:57,060
Thank you.

548
00:41:58,155 --> 00:42:00,801
Let's open that door tonight.

549
00:42:11,166 --> 00:42:13,011
(Station Office)

550
00:42:15,606 --> 00:42:17,451
(Station Office)

551
00:42:22,715 --> 00:42:23,790
Hello, sir.

552
00:42:24,215 --> 00:42:25,451
Is it ready?

553
00:42:25,816 --> 00:42:26,891
Of course.

554
00:42:27,115 --> 00:42:30,131
The Subway Police is in lower-level three.

555
00:42:30,286 --> 00:42:31,391
Let's go.

556
00:42:36,795 --> 00:42:38,870
I'm not too late, am I?

557
00:42:39,825 --> 00:42:42,465
Okay, then. Shall we go eat?

558
00:42:42,465 --> 00:42:43,641
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

559
00:42:45,836 --> 00:42:46,980
Hello everyone.

560
00:42:47,806 --> 00:42:50,310
Stationmaster. Hello.

561
00:42:51,505 --> 00:42:55,150
This is Mr. Cha, the head of
safety of the Subway Corporation.

562
00:42:55,476 --> 00:42:58,350
I see. Hello. But what brings you here?

563
00:42:58,916 --> 00:43:00,215
I'm doing a safety check...

564
00:43:00,215 --> 00:43:01,721
on the station's structure and equipment.

565
00:43:02,985 --> 00:43:04,115
Your cooperation is appreciated.

566
00:43:04,115 --> 00:43:07,100
I see. Thank you for your hard work.
Please take a look around.

567
00:43:16,595 --> 00:43:18,440
Fire extinguisher is in place.

568
00:43:20,206 --> 00:43:23,051
The smoke detectors are in place.

569
00:43:33,786 --> 00:43:35,856
Why don't you have some tea first?

570
00:43:35,856 --> 00:43:38,491
Coffee, buckwheat tea,
or Solomon's seal tea is good too.

571
00:43:39,485 --> 00:43:41,000
(File cabinet 1, File cabinet
2, File cabinet 3)

572
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:52,940
Where's the screen door key?

573
00:43:54,306 --> 00:43:56,175
Well, so...

574
00:43:56,175 --> 00:44:00,120
We decided to confiscate all screen
door keys from Subway Police.

575
00:44:01,945 --> 00:44:04,250
We must control who enters the tunnel.

576
00:44:04,376 --> 00:44:07,286
It should only be handled
by the corporation.

577
00:44:07,286 --> 00:44:08,686
Where is the key?

578
00:44:08,686 --> 00:44:09,891
I...

579
00:44:14,186 --> 00:44:15,761
left it at home.

580
00:44:15,925 --> 00:44:18,531
I always carried it on my
belt since it's so important.

581
00:44:22,496 --> 00:44:23,870
Go get it.

582
00:44:24,135 --> 00:44:26,540
What? Right now?

583
00:44:26,706 --> 00:44:28,011
By any chance...

584
00:44:28,405 --> 00:44:30,475
it gets into the hands of
someone with ill intent,

585
00:44:30,476 --> 00:44:32,350
it may result in a big tragedy.

586
00:44:33,646 --> 00:44:34,821
Go get it.

587
00:44:38,545 --> 00:44:39,761
But...

588
00:44:40,385 --> 00:44:42,956
I'm on duty right now.

589
00:44:42,956 --> 00:44:45,856
Look! The arrest warrant for
the murder suspect came in.

590
00:44:45,856 --> 00:44:48,755
- Chief, you need to go right now.
- Yes.

591
00:44:48,755 --> 00:44:51,301
Since when does the Subway
Police handle murder...

592
00:44:51,496 --> 00:44:54,370
He's a violent monster.
We must catch him right away.

593
00:44:54,795 --> 00:44:56,741
I'll give you the key tomorrow.

594
00:45:01,505 --> 00:45:02,781
Then...

595
00:45:04,575 --> 00:45:06,551
I'll be back at this time tomorrow.

596
00:45:10,215 --> 00:45:12,175
- Let's go.
- Get ready.

597
00:45:12,175 --> 00:45:14,261
Get the gun and handcuffs.

598
00:45:15,545 --> 00:45:16,790
Goodnight.

599
00:45:19,115 --> 00:45:22,286
I had completely forgotten. Where's my head?

600
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:24,471
Chief, we're detectives.

601
00:45:24,655 --> 00:45:27,126
We find a single piece of
hair left in a crime scene.

602
00:45:27,126 --> 00:45:30,471
Finding a key is child's play.

603
00:45:30,766 --> 00:45:33,235
Thank you. Let's look for it.

604
00:45:33,235 --> 00:45:34,781
- Okay.
- Okay.

605
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,620
We can keep questioning people,

606
00:45:46,845 --> 00:45:48,944
but we won't find anything.

607
00:45:48,945 --> 00:45:52,330
He kept flinching his shoulder.

608
00:45:55,186 --> 00:45:58,270
I had a dream last night.

609
00:45:58,496 --> 00:46:02,301
I saw the Subway Ghost
make a call at a payphone.

610
00:46:02,396 --> 00:46:06,411
But he had a shoulder tick.

611
00:46:07,066 --> 00:46:08,411
Like this.

612
00:46:09,976 --> 00:46:13,674
You can call it my sixth sense as a cop.

613
00:46:13,675 --> 00:46:14,775
A precognitive dream.

614
00:46:14,775 --> 00:46:16,650
You punk.

615
00:46:16,746 --> 00:46:18,321
Stop talking nonsense.

616
00:46:19,016 --> 00:46:20,045
I'm sorry.

617
00:46:20,045 --> 00:46:22,790
Seriously.

618
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:46,480
Excuse me. Just a minute.

619
00:46:49,876 --> 00:46:51,190
Police.

620
00:46:52,376 --> 00:46:54,215
You always run at this hour, right?

621
00:46:54,215 --> 00:46:56,391
Do you always take this route?

622
00:46:56,556 --> 00:46:58,286
Yes, I do.

623
00:46:58,286 --> 00:46:59,861
On August 23,

624
00:46:59,985 --> 00:47:02,186
did you see a man at that payphone?

625
00:47:02,186 --> 00:47:03,996
August 23?

626
00:47:03,996 --> 00:47:06,701
That was a month ago. I'm not sure.

627
00:47:07,766 --> 00:47:11,235
Hold on. I don't remember the exact date,

628
00:47:11,235 --> 00:47:13,040
but I did see a suspicious man.

629
00:47:13,336 --> 00:47:16,705
You did? What was he like?
What was suspicious about him?

630
00:47:16,706 --> 00:47:18,451
So, the thing is...

631
00:47:19,845 --> 00:47:23,051
I stopped briefly to tie my shoelaces,

632
00:47:23,575 --> 00:47:26,290
and I heard a man's voice from the payphone.

633
00:47:26,945 --> 00:47:28,560
The strange thing is...

634
00:47:28,985 --> 00:47:31,560
My phone's broken, so I'm getting it fixed.

635
00:47:32,186 --> 00:47:34,801
That's why I'm calling from a payphone.

636
00:47:36,095 --> 00:47:38,301
That sounded so suspicious.

637
00:47:38,556 --> 00:47:40,040
Because he had...

638
00:47:41,295 --> 00:47:43,241
his phone in his hand.

639
00:47:44,896 --> 00:47:48,036
Do you remember anything
else from his conversation?

640
00:47:48,036 --> 00:47:50,306
He asked the other person to meet.

641
00:47:50,306 --> 00:47:52,681
That he found a wallet
and wanted to return it.

642
00:47:52,806 --> 00:47:57,250
He lured her out saying
he'll return what he found?

643
00:47:59,686 --> 00:48:02,261
Return what he found?

644
00:48:02,646 --> 00:48:03,960
Why...

645
00:48:04,286 --> 00:48:07,025
Did you hear where he said to meet?

646
00:48:07,025 --> 00:48:09,056
I didn't hear that.

647
00:48:09,056 --> 00:48:12,496
Did you see his face?
Or anything unusual about him?

648
00:48:12,496 --> 00:48:14,770
It was too dark to see his face,

649
00:48:14,896 --> 00:48:18,540
but he kept flinching his shoulder.

650
00:48:18,695 --> 00:48:20,411
His shoulder?

651
00:48:21,766 --> 00:48:23,111
But...

652
00:48:24,235 --> 00:48:26,881
he had a shoulder tick.

653
00:48:27,476 --> 00:48:28,875
Like this.

654
00:48:28,876 --> 00:48:30,821
That punk...

655
00:48:30,976 --> 00:48:33,585
That's right. That man...

656
00:48:33,586 --> 00:48:36,045
was using the payphone a few days ago too.

657
00:48:36,045 --> 00:48:38,591
A few days ago? 3 days? 4 days?

658
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:41,925
It was raining,
so I considered not going out.

659
00:48:41,925 --> 00:48:44,295
But it stopped right
away, so I came out later.

660
00:48:44,295 --> 00:48:46,670
It rained.

661
00:48:48,695 --> 00:48:51,310
Did he say he found the
person's wallet again?

662
00:48:51,496 --> 00:48:55,210
I ran right by that time,
so I didn't hear what he said.

663
00:48:56,476 --> 00:48:58,980
Okay, thank you.

664
00:49:03,916 --> 00:49:05,920
Whom did he call?

665
00:49:09,856 --> 00:49:12,060
Did he find another target?

666
00:49:16,655 --> 00:49:18,870
I came here every night too.

667
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:20,301
What...

668
00:49:21,325 --> 00:49:23,141
did I see that night?

669
00:49:26,566 --> 00:49:28,940
(No cards - Out of Order)

670
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:34,445
The Subway Ghost always
used a phone card until now.

671
00:49:34,445 --> 00:49:38,821
But he couldn't use his card that night.

672
00:49:45,556 --> 00:49:50,094
Woo Hyuk. Call the phone company.
Ask them to empty the coin box.

673
00:49:50,095 --> 00:49:54,270
Get the call history of
this phone on September 11.

674
00:49:54,766 --> 00:49:56,571
Here's the list of calls from the payphone.

675
00:49:57,896 --> 00:50:00,781
010-493-0951.

676
00:50:00,806 --> 00:50:02,841
The number belongs to Choi Mi Ra.

677
00:50:13,586 --> 00:50:14,686
Why won't she pick up?

678
00:50:14,686 --> 00:50:18,690
So the Subway Ghost called Choi
Mi Ra five days ago already.

679
00:50:19,885 --> 00:50:21,801
If she's the target,

680
00:50:22,385 --> 00:50:24,396
we would've found the body by now.

681
00:50:24,396 --> 00:50:27,741
There may have been a glitch
in his plan for some reason.

682
00:50:28,226 --> 00:50:30,465
Find her address and go there right now.

683
00:50:30,465 --> 00:50:32,270
Let's check her workplace.

684
00:50:38,536 --> 00:50:39,775
Lieutenant.

685
00:50:39,775 --> 00:50:43,920
Choi Mi Ra was a Subway Police
officer at Wangsoori two years ago.

686
00:50:44,376 --> 00:50:45,750
Subway Police?

687
00:50:53,925 --> 00:50:56,056
It's so late. All because of me.

688
00:50:56,056 --> 00:50:59,071
Go home. Let's look again tomorrow.

689
00:50:59,456 --> 00:51:00,701
Okay.

690
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:10,810
Do you know her?
She used to work at Wangsoori Station.

691
00:51:14,545 --> 00:51:16,150
She looks familiar.

692
00:51:16,675 --> 00:51:20,690
Choi Mi Ra. She was on Team Two.

693
00:51:20,816 --> 00:51:24,956
She worked here before you came, Chief.

694
00:51:24,956 --> 00:51:27,031
I didn't see her here.

695
00:51:27,485 --> 00:51:28,900
Recently...

696
00:51:29,286 --> 00:51:31,556
You had reported that you lost your wallet.

697
00:51:31,556 --> 00:51:34,571
I thought someone had stolen it.

698
00:51:34,595 --> 00:51:38,511
Newbie, isn't she the victim
we went to see before?

699
00:51:38,865 --> 00:51:42,181
What about her? Did something happen to her?

700
00:51:42,505 --> 00:51:44,480
I was nervous about her.

701
00:51:45,005 --> 00:51:47,845
She was going to pick up her wallet,
but I had a strange feeling...

702
00:51:47,845 --> 00:51:49,620
She went to pick up her wallet?

703
00:51:51,945 --> 00:51:53,591
She really was his target.

704
00:51:53,686 --> 00:51:54,786
Target?

705
00:51:54,786 --> 00:51:56,261
Choi Mi Ra...

706
00:51:56,385 --> 00:51:58,730
is the Subway Ghost's next target.

707
00:52:09,325 --> 00:52:11,070
(Choi Mi Ra)

708
00:52:12,164 --> 00:52:15,769
(Friday, September 20, 2019, 8pm)

709
00:52:20,535 --> 00:52:21,575
Who is that?

710
00:52:21,575 --> 00:52:22,935
(Call)

711
00:52:22,935 --> 00:52:24,705
(I'll just put your wallet in a mailbox.)

712
00:52:24,705 --> 00:52:26,544
(It should get to you in a week.
Have a good day.)

713
00:52:26,544 --> 00:52:28,345
What? It wasn't a weird person after all.

714
00:52:28,345 --> 00:52:29,889
I almost wasted my ticket.

715
00:52:34,914 --> 00:52:38,354
Hello. Something came up last
time, so I couldn't make it.

716
00:52:38,354 --> 00:52:39,429
I'm sorry.

717
00:52:41,225 --> 00:52:43,570
There's a ticket in my wallet,

718
00:52:43,794 --> 00:52:44,865
and it's for a show tomorrow.

719
00:52:44,865 --> 00:52:47,039
If you put it in a mailbox, I'll miss it.

720
00:52:48,035 --> 00:52:50,280
If it's okay with you,
could I get it from you right now?

721
00:52:51,504 --> 00:52:54,710
Yes. I'll see you later, then. Thank you.

722
00:52:56,405 --> 00:52:57,519
Awesome.

723
00:53:02,414 --> 00:53:03,559
Yes, Officer Kim.

724
00:53:06,044 --> 00:53:07,159
I'm sorry?

725
00:53:08,615 --> 00:53:09,730
Okay.

726
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:13,469
They just met with Choi Mi Ra's family,

727
00:53:13,754 --> 00:53:15,900
and they say she just
left to get her wallet.

728
00:53:16,495 --> 00:53:18,469
- They don't know where she went.
- No...

729
00:53:19,664 --> 00:53:20,969
She'll die if she goes there.

730
00:53:22,535 --> 00:53:24,139
We have to stop her no matter what.

731
00:53:27,834 --> 00:53:29,050
It's the same number.

732
00:53:36,484 --> 00:53:37,820
The phone is turned off.

733
00:53:39,584 --> 00:53:40,714
She turned off her phone.

734
00:53:40,714 --> 00:53:43,599
The criminal will lure the
target to a subway station again.

735
00:53:43,725 --> 00:53:45,385
The last trains will stop
running in the next hour.

736
00:53:45,385 --> 00:53:46,670
That means Choi Mi Ra...

737
00:53:47,325 --> 00:53:50,039
is meeting the criminal
within the next hour.

738
00:53:50,095 --> 00:53:52,269
There are too many subway stations.
How will we find her?

739
00:53:52,325 --> 00:53:54,340
We don't have to search all the stations.

740
00:53:55,394 --> 00:53:57,265
All the victims went missing...

741
00:53:57,265 --> 00:53:59,239
within three stations away
from Wangsoori Station.

742
00:53:59,734 --> 00:54:01,675
We just have to search the
stations up to three stops away...

743
00:54:01,675 --> 00:54:04,244
on the four subway lines that pass here.

744
00:54:04,245 --> 00:54:05,550
Also, Line Three, since it's close by.

745
00:54:10,814 --> 00:54:13,084
If he really does electric
work at the station,

746
00:54:13,084 --> 00:54:14,185
there's a place where a
sign was about to go up...

747
00:54:14,185 --> 00:54:16,924
and the walls were drilled for
electric work. But that place...

748
00:54:16,925 --> 00:54:19,230
You mean he really did
have a shoulder tic, right?

749
00:54:19,385 --> 00:54:22,630
That person kept on flinching.

750
00:54:22,694 --> 00:54:24,070
What Officer Yoo said was right.

751
00:54:25,664 --> 00:54:27,893
We'll search the stations
up to three stops away,

752
00:54:27,894 --> 00:54:29,269
including Line Three.

753
00:54:29,694 --> 00:54:30,834
I'll summon our team.

754
00:54:30,834 --> 00:54:33,880
This is an emergency.
Please follow my orders from now.

755
00:54:34,234 --> 00:54:35,435
- Okay.
- Okay.

756
00:54:35,435 --> 00:54:37,349
- Which line do you want us to take?
- Gyeongui–Jungang line.

757
00:54:37,874 --> 00:54:40,519
Shinbundang line. Line 5. I'll take Line 2.

758
00:54:40,774 --> 00:54:42,289
We'll start searching right away.

759
00:54:43,214 --> 00:54:44,360
Wait.

760
00:54:45,584 --> 00:54:48,789
Mi Ra almost went out to
get her wallet before.

761
00:54:51,484 --> 00:54:52,754
This is the record of our call.

762
00:54:52,754 --> 00:54:55,294
Can we track where she made the call from?

763
00:54:55,294 --> 00:54:57,139
Do you think he would've
called her to the same station?

764
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:58,394
The criminal is someone careful.

765
00:54:58,394 --> 00:55:00,865
It's unlikely he would have
called her to the same place.

766
00:55:00,865 --> 00:55:02,639
I'm not saying we should
go to the same station.

767
00:55:02,964 --> 00:55:06,480
I want to know exactly where in
the station he called her to.

768
00:55:08,205 --> 00:55:09,880
We have to get to him...

769
00:55:10,405 --> 00:55:12,044
before he realizes and runs away.

770
00:55:12,044 --> 00:55:14,750
We can't figure that out right now.
We're tight on time!

771
00:55:16,345 --> 00:55:17,789
I think I can do it.

772
00:55:19,044 --> 00:55:20,190
Please.

773
00:55:20,584 --> 00:55:22,659
If we lose the criminal because of you,

774
00:55:23,624 --> 00:55:24,860
you're going to get it.

775
00:55:27,225 --> 00:55:28,925
This is Ha Ma Ri of the
Metropolitan Detective Division.

776
00:55:28,925 --> 00:55:31,995
The phone number is 010, 493, 0951.

777
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:35,064
A call was made on September 14th at 3:23pm.
Please track...

778
00:55:35,064 --> 00:55:37,035
- where the call was made from.
- Does Metro get answers this fast?

779
00:55:37,035 --> 00:55:38,380
- Be quiet.
- Yes.

780
00:55:41,705 --> 00:55:42,880
Seonheul Station.

781
00:55:43,444 --> 00:55:44,543
Seonheul Station?

782
00:55:44,544 --> 00:55:46,449
(Bring down the Grasshoppers, D-66)

783
00:55:48,745 --> 00:55:51,615
There are two staircases with
wheelchair lifts installed.

784
00:55:51,615 --> 00:55:53,829
He must have lured her to a place nearby.

785
00:55:54,214 --> 00:55:56,090
First, the stairs to the
first basement floor.

786
00:55:57,225 --> 00:55:58,955
There's a square at the bottom.

787
00:55:58,955 --> 00:56:00,929
The criminal can't escape from
being seen by people there.

788
00:56:01,624 --> 00:56:03,639
There are washrooms below the stairs,

789
00:56:03,995 --> 00:56:05,469
but there are security cameras there.

790
00:56:05,825 --> 00:56:07,340
Then, the stairs to the
second basement floor...

791
00:56:07,865 --> 00:56:10,340
There's a convenience store and a snack bar.

792
00:56:11,164 --> 00:56:12,309
No, not there.

793
00:56:13,205 --> 00:56:15,805
Above the stairs is...

794
00:56:15,805 --> 00:56:17,150
(Restricted Area)

795
00:56:17,944 --> 00:56:19,119
A restricted area.

796
00:56:20,015 --> 00:56:21,119
"A restricted area"?

797
00:56:21,214 --> 00:56:24,420
The criminal was murdering
people in restricted areas.

798
00:56:30,624 --> 00:56:31,885
(Restricted Area)

799
00:56:31,885 --> 00:56:34,024
(Haengdang Station, Singeumho
Station, Cheonggu Station)

800
00:56:34,024 --> 00:56:35,024
(Seoul Forest Station)

801
00:56:35,024 --> 00:56:37,300
(Munseong Station)

802
00:56:38,524 --> 00:56:39,663
There are 2 restricted areas
in the 2nd basement level...

803
00:56:39,664 --> 00:56:40,809
of Haengdang Station.

804
00:56:41,495 --> 00:56:43,064
There's 1 in Singeumho Station
on the 1st basement floor.

805
00:56:43,064 --> 00:56:44,434
In Cheonggu Station,
there's 1 on the 1st basement level,

806
00:56:44,435 --> 00:56:45,539
and 2 on the 2nd.

807
00:56:45,734 --> 00:56:46,805
At Seoul Forest Station...

808
00:56:46,805 --> 00:56:50,449
Everyone, focus your search
on these restricted areas.

809
00:56:51,444 --> 00:56:53,205
- Yes, ma'am.
- Starting from now,

810
00:56:53,205 --> 00:56:55,449
- we'll split up.
- Hurry up.

811
00:56:58,385 --> 00:57:00,090
The screen doors are opening.

812
00:57:16,035 --> 00:57:17,480
Doors are closing.

813
00:57:17,765 --> 00:57:19,380
- Doors are closing.
- That way?

814
00:57:25,245 --> 00:57:26,380
That way.

815
00:58:00,175 --> 00:58:01,544

You're...

821
00:58:50,865 --> 00:58:52,000
Stay still!

822
00:59:20,055 --> 00:59:21,130

823

(Restricted Area)

824
00:59:43,214 --> 00:59:44,289
Is this it?

825
00:59:59,725 --> 01:00:01,769
Open the door. We're the police.

826
01:00:03,234 --> 01:00:04,380
Open the door!

827
01:00:26,794 --> 01:00:28,570
(Catch the Ghost)

828
01:00:28,995 --> 01:00:30,124
You have to stay alive.

829
01:00:30,124 --> 01:00:33,400
You're the only one who knows his face.

830
01:00:33,935 --> 01:00:36,639
Hey, what does your son do?

831
01:00:38,164 --> 01:00:40,409
This is his hideout.

832
01:00:40,504 --> 01:00:43,309
Who else knows there is such a place?

833
01:00:43,575 --> 01:00:44,943
Since when did you start...

834
01:00:44,944 --> 01:00:46,380
going in the tunnel without telling me?

835
01:00:46,504 --> 01:00:49,849
Ryung had just one family.

836
01:00:50,544 --> 01:00:52,820
Her twin sister who had autism.

837
01:00:53,314 --> 01:00:54,530
