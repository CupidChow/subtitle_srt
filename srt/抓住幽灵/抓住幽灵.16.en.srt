1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,600
CATCH THE GHOST

2
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,867
{\an8}CATCH THE GHOST

3
00:00:24,934 --> 00:00:25,867
THIS DRAMA IS FICTION

4
00:00:25,934 --> 00:00:27,834
THE CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
INSTITUTIONS, AND EVENTS AREN'T REAL

5
00:00:28,734 --> 00:00:30,667
If I tell you where Jin is...

6
00:00:31,934 --> 00:00:34,633
can you make sure I-jun never finds her?

7
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,200
Where is she?

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,300
Jin is...

9
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,433
I don't know where she is.

10
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:58,600
Mom.

11
00:01:00,567 --> 00:01:02,033
What's with the cliffhanger?

12
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:35,066
I'm truly sorry about Sae-rom.

13
00:01:36,633 --> 00:01:37,767
It's my fault...

14
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,767
because I'm Jin's guardian.

15
00:01:44,533 --> 00:01:45,400
But...

16
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,767
What happened that day was an accident.

17
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,133
See?

18
00:01:57,066 --> 00:01:59,066
You're just brushing it off
because it isn't your life.

19
00:02:01,633 --> 00:02:02,500
An accident?

20
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,500
Would you be able to say that
if it was your sister who died that day?

21
00:02:08,433 --> 00:02:12,000
I would've felt wronged
and hated the world.

22
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,767
It would've hurt so much.

23
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,100
But the moment you chose to kill
in order to heal,

24
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:24,166
you became a murderer and nothing else.

25
00:02:24,767 --> 00:02:25,633
Heal...

26
00:02:30,533 --> 00:02:32,233
I don't care about that.

27
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,266
If I am healed,

28
00:02:37,033 --> 00:02:38,900
it'll be like it never happened.

29
00:02:41,667 --> 00:02:43,700
If I pretend
that it never happened as well...

30
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:47,333
I'd feel too bad for Sae-rom.

31
00:02:55,533 --> 00:02:57,133
You miss your sister, too, right?

32
00:03:01,567 --> 00:03:03,767
Do you want me to tell you how it was

33
00:03:05,533 --> 00:03:06,400
when I saw her last?

34
00:03:07,133 --> 00:03:08,033
No.

35
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,333
Don't.

36
00:03:10,734 --> 00:03:11,967
I strangled her,

37
00:03:13,467 --> 00:03:15,200
so it must've been difficult to breathe.

38
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,300
But she was trying to say something.

39
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:24,567
I thought she had something left to say,
so I let her breathe for a second.

40
00:03:31,266 --> 00:03:32,467
Ryeong.

41
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,066
-Ryeong.
-Stop it!

42
00:03:38,266 --> 00:03:39,200
Will you shoot me?

43
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:43,867
Go ahead. I'll give you a chance to do so.

44
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,300
-What are you doing?
-You've been wanting to kill me, too.

45
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,734
You thought I killed your sister,
so you came after me to kill me, right?

46
00:03:54,533 --> 00:03:55,700
I don't kill people.

47
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,133
Put your hands up
if you want to turn yourself in.

48
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,867
If you don't kill me now,
your sister will die.

49
00:04:01,934 --> 00:04:02,800
Why?

50
00:04:03,767 --> 00:04:07,834
Because as long as I am alive,
I will find her and kill her.

51
00:04:15,934 --> 00:04:17,233
If I run into Jin again...

52
00:04:19,367 --> 00:04:24,200
should I tell her that she's about to die
because you failed to kill me?

53
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,867
This time,

54
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:30,700
she won't be calling your name.

55
00:04:33,734 --> 00:04:34,567
That's enough.

56
00:04:35,633 --> 00:04:36,467
Shoot.

57
00:04:37,266 --> 00:04:38,300
Shoot me!

58
00:04:39,367 --> 00:04:41,400
Don't you want to kill me?

59
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,700
Kill me. Shoot!

60
00:04:53,133 --> 00:04:54,033
See?

61
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,967
You and I are the same.

62
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,500
No, I-jun!

63
00:05:51,834 --> 00:05:52,700
Die!

64
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,500
Die.

65
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,233
How come

66
00:06:33,033 --> 00:06:34,300
you're never on my side, Mom?

67
00:06:36,467 --> 00:06:39,033
Where's Jin?

68
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:52,967
Please do me a favor.

69
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,333
Come to Sunil Motel, please.

70
00:07:04,767 --> 00:07:05,767
Jin.

71
00:07:07,367 --> 00:07:11,100
Please keep Jin in hiding
until the Subway Ghost is caught.

72
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:15,567
He knows that I have Jin.

73
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,166
Please.

74
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:26,333
We have to go.
Please listen to me just this once.

75
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,900
Jin.

76
00:07:31,133 --> 00:07:32,000
Let's go.

77
00:07:35,033 --> 00:07:36,500
<i>Where is she?</i>

78
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,100
I don't know.

79
00:07:42,133 --> 00:07:44,133
I don't know what you're talking about.

80
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,834
That's because you've lost your mind.

81
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,667
You took her in because
you lost your mind after Sae-rom died.

82
00:07:53,367 --> 00:07:55,000
But she's not Sae-rom.

83
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,900
She's the one who killed Sae-rom!

84
00:07:59,133 --> 00:08:02,667
I really don't know where she is, I-jun.

85
00:08:02,734 --> 00:08:05,867
-Please trust me.
-How can you be on her side?

86
00:08:07,367 --> 00:08:09,600
She's the one who killed Sae-rom!

87
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:22,934
Until now,

88
00:08:24,567 --> 00:08:26,367
I thought I was protecting my pitiful son

89
00:08:27,567 --> 00:08:30,700
who lost his mind
because of his daughter's death.

90
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,834
-But I guess I was wrong.
-Where is Jin?

91
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,000
I didn't want to admit...

92
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:41,900
that my son is a serial killer.

93
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,300
No, I couldn't admit it.

94
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,467
So I justified your killings
and overlooked everything.

95
00:08:49,533 --> 00:08:50,367
But...

96
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,333
Now I know for sure.

97
00:08:56,867 --> 00:08:58,300
You and I...

98
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,467
We're just murderers.

99
00:09:06,266 --> 00:09:07,200
I should've stopped

100
00:09:08,467 --> 00:09:11,400
this misfortune with my own hands earlier.

101
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,934
It's all my fault.

102
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,600
Ms. Choi Gyeong-hui!

103
00:09:37,567 --> 00:09:40,400
Ms. Choi Gyeong-hui.
Come down. It's too dangerous.

104
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,033
Come on down.

105
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm sorry about your mother.

106
00:10:10,734 --> 00:10:11,567
No.

107
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,033
No.

108
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,166
No!

109
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:33,900
Mom.

110
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:37,000
Mom.

111
00:10:38,567 --> 00:10:39,734
That bastard.

112
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,200
What happened?

113
00:10:48,133 --> 00:10:50,567
I'm fine. Go after him.

114
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:52,700
That bastard.

115
00:11:13,934 --> 00:11:14,767
Mom.

116
00:11:35,367 --> 00:11:36,200
Mom.

117
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,233
Mom!

118
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,100
Grandma.

119
00:12:15,233 --> 00:12:16,300
Grandma.

120
00:12:24,233 --> 00:12:25,367
Drop the knife!

121
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,500
Jin.

122
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:32,533
This is the last warning.
Drop your knife and put your hands up.

123
00:12:37,567 --> 00:12:38,500
Grandma.

124
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,000
Let's go.

125
00:12:43,633 --> 00:12:46,266
Let's go home, Grandma.

126
00:12:49,233 --> 00:12:50,200
Grandma.

127
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,633
Grandma!

128
00:12:58,734 --> 00:13:01,000
I'll be Sae-rom, Grandma.

129
00:13:02,066 --> 00:13:03,700
Grandma!

130
00:13:05,533 --> 00:13:08,467
I'll be Sae-rom, Grandma.

131
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,033
I mean it.

132
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,533
Grandma!

133
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,567
-Sae-rom.
-Grandma.

134
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:23,066
Grandma.

135
00:13:24,734 --> 00:13:25,567
No.

136
00:13:29,033 --> 00:13:32,233
I'll be Sae-rom, Grandma.

137
00:13:46,266 --> 00:13:47,166
Grandma.

138
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:49,166
Jin.

139
00:13:52,667 --> 00:13:54,066
Jin.

140
00:14:05,734 --> 00:14:06,567
Jin.

141
00:14:12,367 --> 00:14:13,967
Jin!

142
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,667
Jin!

143
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,333
Jin...

144
00:14:22,567 --> 00:14:23,533
Jin!

145
00:14:24,533 --> 00:14:25,367
Jin!

146
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,233
Jin.

147
00:14:32,266 --> 00:14:34,767
Jin!

148
00:14:35,967 --> 00:14:37,066
STOP

149
00:14:38,133 --> 00:14:39,100
Jin!

150
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,166
Jin!

151
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,567
Jin. It's me.

152
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,734
It's me, Jin.

153
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,900
Stay right there. I'll come over to you.

154
00:14:59,967 --> 00:15:01,133
Stay right there.

155
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,033
Jin.

156
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,000
Jin!

157
00:15:18,066 --> 00:15:19,333
Jin.

158
00:15:19,934 --> 00:15:21,033
Jin.

159
00:15:21,934 --> 00:15:23,000
Jin.

160
00:15:25,667 --> 00:15:27,000
Jin.

161
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,700
Jin!

SEOUN METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

168
00:16:53,433 --> 00:16:55,533
You're part of the Subway Police,
not the RIU.

169
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,667
How did you end up arresting Kim I-jun?

170
00:16:57,734 --> 00:17:02,233
What is your secret to arresting
the serial killer of the century?

171
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:05,767
There is news of your double promotion.
Please make a comment on that.

172
00:17:05,834 --> 00:17:08,967
-How do you feel? Please make a comment.
-All right.

173
00:17:09,033 --> 00:17:13,133
Please raise your hand
and ask a question one by one.

174
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,667
The Subway Ghost went as far as
leaving the bodies

175
00:17:19,734 --> 00:17:21,467
inside a subway bench.

176
00:17:21,533 --> 00:17:22,967
Do you know why he did that?

177
00:17:23,734 --> 00:17:26,400
I think he wanted to let
many people know about

178
00:17:26,467 --> 00:17:27,934
his daughter's wrongful death.

179
00:17:29,367 --> 00:17:32,066
He wanted to tell people that

180
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,800
what killed his daughter wasn't the subway
but the passengers' indifference.

181
00:17:37,867 --> 00:17:41,767
If that was his goal,
he may have been arrested,

182
00:17:41,834 --> 00:17:44,533
but he has achieved his goal.

183
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,400
What is your opinion on that?

184
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,967
Just because this case has become famous

185
00:17:52,667 --> 00:17:56,467
doesn't mean people agree
with or understand Kim I-jun.

186
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,000
No matter what the circumstance was,
murders cannot be justified.

Excuse me?

210
00:20:20,367 --> 00:20:21,567
Three months ago,

211
00:20:22,266 --> 00:20:24,166
I put my pride as a cop

212
00:20:24,867 --> 00:20:28,300
and my career at stake
and made a promise to the people.

213
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,066
I said that if I don't catch
the Subway Ghost,

214
00:20:31,867 --> 00:20:33,633
I will step down from my post.

215

What?

219
00:20:58,467 --> 00:21:00,233
-What are you talking about?
-Why is that?

220
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,300
Is Kim I-jun not the Subway Ghost?

221
00:21:02,367 --> 00:21:04,767
We did catch the Subway Ghost,

222
00:21:04,834 --> 00:21:08,000
but we haven't solved the case
completely yet.

223
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,567
During the investigation,

224
00:21:11,734 --> 00:21:14,967
we found out
that the first victim was someone else.

225
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:18,767
She is the only survivor of this case,

226
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:22,433
but she is also the first victim
that we didn't save for a long time.

227
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,433
And we still haven't found her.

228
00:21:27,633 --> 00:21:30,200
The victim's sister asked the police
to find her many times,

229
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,700
but the police

230
00:21:34,266 --> 00:21:37,166
failed to listen to her.

231
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,767
I will take the responsibility
and step down.

232
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,433
We have our next case.
It's a serial robbery.

233
00:22:44,367 --> 00:22:46,834
Yes, we do need to get on the next case.

234
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,133
But I need to finish this case first.

235
00:22:59,166 --> 00:23:00,900
I'm going to look for Jin.

236
00:23:03,033 --> 00:23:04,066

237
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,233
Me.

238
00:23:09,166 --> 00:23:11,200
There's a mosquito here.

239
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:16,133
-I haven't done much for Detective Yoo.
-Me neither.

240
00:23:17,166 --> 00:23:18,133

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,600
We'll go look around the nearby stores.

243
00:23:25,667 --> 00:23:27,667
I'll hand out missing-person fliers.

Let's go.

245
00:23:29,066 --> 00:23:31,767
I'll go check the nearby security cameras.

246
00:23:31,834 --> 00:23:32,667
Okay.

247
00:23:33,567 --> 00:23:35,633

You're indeed my daughter.

250
00:23:44,967 --> 00:23:47,233
You are so cool.

251
00:24:18,266 --> 00:24:21,233
Please show yourself, Jin.
You're hanging your sister out to dry.

252
00:24:22,066 --> 00:24:24,033
Rookie must be really upset.

253
00:24:24,834 --> 00:24:28,900
She looked everywhere to find her sister
and even went into the tunnel.

254
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:30,133
I know.

255
00:24:30,467 --> 00:24:33,166
This situation is worse than
when she thought Jin was dead.

256
00:24:35,333 --> 00:24:36,567
Help me find her.

257
00:24:36,633 --> 00:24:37,934

-Watch carefully.

269

270

for a little bit?

272
00:25:56,934 --> 00:25:58,233
You can do that for me, right?

273
00:26:08,834 --> 00:26:10,533
I know that your sister abandoned you.

274
00:26:13,767 --> 00:26:14,767

275
00:26:17,066 --> 00:26:19,100

every single second since then.

280
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,734
I know that you want
to go back to your sister, too.

281
00:26:44,233 --> 00:26:45,533
You're just afraid

282
00:26:46,934 --> 00:26:48,900
that you'll be abandoned again
if you go back.

283
00:26:50,667 --> 00:26:55,500

That's right. I did.

330

because you were so pretty.

334
00:35:46,834 --> 00:35:50,900
My mother has dementia,
so she doesn't recognize me.

335
00:35:52,533 --> 00:35:54,734
That must be upsetting.

336
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,533
No, I'm not upset at all.

My mom...

338
00:36:00,233 --> 00:36:03,867
She seems to be happier
than when she remembered me.

339
00:36:04,767 --> 00:36:07,700
Even so, you must be upset.

340
00:36:09,533 --> 00:36:10,967

You see, Jin is a homebody.

359
00:37:47,667 --> 00:37:52,166
She's scared to be in crowded places,
so I brought her here.

360
00:37:53,834 --> 00:37:58,300
But when we were here,
she still had her eyes only on me.

361
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,300
That's when I realized

362
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,600
that I was the one
who made her a homebody.

363
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:07,800
To be honest,

364
00:38:08,333 --> 00:38:10,533
I'm the one who hates
going to crowded places.

365
00:38:12,367 --> 00:38:16,734
When Jin makes a loud noise,
people try hard not to stare.

00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,033
Since Jin feels everything I feel,

367
00:38:24,133 --> 00:38:25,767
she didn't like crowded places either.

368
00:38:32,233 --> 00:38:35,066
But I don't care about
people staring at us now.

369
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:41,767
Jin does feel everything that you feel.

370
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,800
Since you're happy,
she's enjoying the flowers.

371
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,467
Wait.

372
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:50,600
It must've been hard for Jin
to look after her sister.

373
00:38:51,533 --> 00:38:54,467
Oh. You're right.

374
00:38:54,533 --> 00:38:55,934
-I was the problem.
-Gosh.

375
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,934
You were.

376
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,333
-Jin.
-Let's go get Jin.

377
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,133
-I'll go get her.
-Okay.

378
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,300
-Gosh.
-I'm sorry.

379
00:39:02,367 --> 00:39:03,734
-I'm so tired.
-Jin.

380
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,467
Let's go eat.

381
00:39:22,767 --> 00:39:24,100
Now this is what I call a vacation.

382
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:30,700
-The water is so clear here.
-Yes.

383
00:39:30,767 --> 00:39:33,033
-Father.
-Hey!

384
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,867
-That's cold.
-It's okay.

385
00:39:34,934 --> 00:39:35,967
Hey.

386
00:39:46,333 --> 00:39:47,734
-It's so clear!
-Hey.

387
00:39:49,533 --> 00:39:50,367
Hey.

388
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,934
-Hey.
-It's so cold.

389
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,800
-It's cold.
-Jin.

390
00:39:57,233 --> 00:39:59,066
-It's deeper than I thought.
-Brain freeze.

391
00:39:59,934 --> 00:40:03,333
-There are fish here.
-Hey. Let's go over there, too.

392
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:13,834
Jin. Su-ho caught some fish.

393
00:40:14,367 --> 00:40:15,467
Would you like to see them?

394
00:40:15,834 --> 00:40:18,600
Be careful.

395
00:40:18,667 --> 00:40:20,000
Careful.

396
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,700
-Look. These are fish.
-Fish!

397
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:29,533
Rookie.

398
00:40:34,767 --> 00:40:36,567
Well...

399
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,400
Did you find a place for Jin?

400
00:40:40,734 --> 00:40:43,433
There is a group home near our place.

401
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,834
-I see.
-People like Jin gather there

402
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,934
to learn how to get along
with others and be independent.

403
00:40:50,567 --> 00:40:53,600
She can stay there overnight
when I'm on night duty.

404
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:57,266
That's great. I hope she likes it there.

405
00:40:59,734 --> 00:41:00,667
Rookie.

406
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,200
I have something for you.

407
00:41:18,066 --> 00:41:19,834
What is this?

408
00:41:21,066 --> 00:41:21,900
Open it.

409
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,500
YOO JIN

410
00:41:37,967 --> 00:41:39,100
I...

411
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,233
I was going to give it to Jin myself,
but she won't give me a glance.

412
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,600
Your number is on here, too.

413
00:41:49,967 --> 00:41:51,700
I need to be close enough with Jin

414
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,834
so she can trust me and call me
when something happens to her.

415
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,333
No.

416
00:42:49,934 --> 00:42:52,433
-You're not going to wash up?
-No.

417
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:53,467
Oh, you won't...

418
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,533
You won't wash up.

419
00:42:56,967 --> 00:43:00,200
You never change.

420
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:01,767
Right?

421
00:43:02,867 --> 00:43:03,967
It's no use.

422
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:09,800
Let's go to bed now.

423
00:43:13,367 --> 00:43:14,200
Oh, my.

424
00:43:36,767 --> 00:43:38,367
-Rookie.
-Yes?

425
00:43:46,266 --> 00:43:49,800
The answer that you haven't given me...

426
00:43:51,767 --> 00:43:52,867
I want to hear it now.

427
00:43:56,967 --> 00:44:01,834
To be honest,
I want us to be official right now,

428
00:44:02,567 --> 00:44:04,133
but that would be selfish of me.

429
00:44:05,266 --> 00:44:08,166
So give me your answer after we catch him.

430
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,266
The answer?

431
00:44:13,834 --> 00:44:14,767
Should we...

432
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:16,133
starting today...

433
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,567
Should we be official starting today...

434
00:44:21,166 --> 00:44:22,033
Okay.

435
00:44:24,667 --> 00:44:25,500
What?

436
00:44:27,166 --> 00:44:28,600
What did you say?

437
00:44:31,133 --> 00:44:34,667
I'll be your girlfriend starting today.

438
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,166
Really? I should've asked sooner.

439
00:44:39,233 --> 00:44:41,900
Thank you.
I'll be good to you forever. I mean...

440
00:44:41,967 --> 00:44:43,266
I'll keep being good to you.

441
00:44:48,233 --> 00:44:50,767
-Thank you.
-Thank you more.

442
00:45:12,667 --> 00:45:13,500
Then...

443
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,166
Shall we go to bed now?

444
00:45:17,133 --> 00:45:18,700
Good night.

445
00:45:28,533 --> 00:45:29,667
Good night.

446
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:35,767
It won't close all the way.

447
00:46:28,433 --> 00:46:29,934
STAFF LOUNGE

448
00:46:37,266 --> 00:46:39,867
-Let's go for our morning undercover.
-Gosh.

449
00:46:40,667 --> 00:46:44,633
You sound like
we're going for our morning walk.

450
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:47,233
You make me feel...

451
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:50,166
so refreshed.

452
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:42,500
You may be my boyfriend
but don't get in the way of my job.

453
00:47:42,567 --> 00:47:44,367
Don't cross the line at work.

454
00:47:44,433 --> 00:47:47,667
You beat me to it. Don't cross the line.

455
00:47:47,734 --> 00:47:50,900
You may be my girlfriend,
but I won't forgive you for being rude.

456
00:47:50,967 --> 00:47:53,000
How is a detective going after
a bad guy being rude?

457
00:47:53,066 --> 00:47:54,633
He had a weapon with him.

458
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:58,033
Why would you go after him unarmed?
I told you to go bring a stun gun.

459
00:47:58,100 --> 00:47:59,567
What if something happened
while I was gone?

460
00:47:59,633 --> 00:48:01,266
What would happen when I was on him?

461
00:48:02,533 --> 00:48:04,000
You don't trust me?

462
00:48:09,467 --> 00:48:10,400
Jeez.

463
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:51,500
She shot the gun only to save the victim.

464
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:56,867
Please give us another chance.
I will teach her to be a better detective.

465
00:48:57,367 --> 00:49:00,166
I bought this to give it
to my partner when I got one.

466
00:49:01,033 --> 00:49:03,300
I finally get to give it to you.

467
00:49:06,166 --> 00:49:09,400
Thank you, Partner.

468
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:17,433
-Let's get started.
-Keep your eyes only on me.

469
00:49:29,066 --> 00:49:30,767
I'm Shinmok Patrol Station's
Officer Yoo Ryeong.

470
00:49:30,834 --> 00:49:32,567
I'm here for the interview.

471
00:49:32,633 --> 00:49:35,500
The thrill I get when the subway
travels 110 km per hour underground.

472
00:49:35,567 --> 00:49:39,700
How great would it be
if I could feel that at work every day?

473
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:42,767
Is she a pervert?

474
00:49:46,367 --> 00:49:48,233
I'm here.

475
00:49:51,834 --> 00:49:54,734
I thought you were dead.

476
00:50:20,266 --> 00:50:23,266
Don't ever mess
with my partner ever again.

477
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,767
I hold a total of 18 dan
in martial arts, too!

478
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:41,567
I have a cut here, too.

479
00:51:02,867 --> 00:51:05,300
I'll be careful from now on.

480
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:07,834
Can I trust you this time?

481
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:11,166
-Trust me.
-I'm telling you.

482
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:14,767
You'd better not get a cut
on your pretty face.

483
00:51:16,667 --> 00:51:17,934
Look at this. Let me see.

484
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,266
-It hurts, right?
-No.

485
00:51:24,734 --> 00:51:25,567
Give me your hand.

486
00:52:24,333 --> 00:52:25,734
You're here early.

487
00:52:28,266 --> 00:52:29,100
Yes.

488
00:52:29,967 --> 00:52:31,333
I got excited since it's our first date.

489
00:52:38,367 --> 00:52:39,767
Where should we go?

490
00:52:40,367 --> 00:52:43,266
Rookie, what do you like to do
besides catching bad guys?

491
00:52:46,567 --> 00:52:47,633
Well...

492
00:52:48,533 --> 00:52:49,467
I...

493
00:52:52,533 --> 00:52:54,567
-I like to stay still and do nothing.
-What?

494
00:52:55,767 --> 00:52:57,934
I thought you couldn't stay still
for a second.

495
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,033
That's exactly why.

496
00:52:59,834 --> 00:53:02,266
I want to do something
that I've never done.

497
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:04,133
That's nice.

498
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,867
I like staying still
and doing nothing, too.

499
00:53:11,233 --> 00:53:12,200
All right.

500
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:13,867
Then...

501
00:53:14,834 --> 00:53:17,967
Let's not do anything
and stay still today.

502
00:53:35,867 --> 00:53:37,300
This is nice.

503
00:53:39,567 --> 00:53:41,633
What were you like as a child?

504
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:44,400
I can imagine you being
a bossy little devil.

505
00:53:46,266 --> 00:53:47,700
I...

506
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:49,333
I was the chatty one.

507
00:53:49,934 --> 00:53:51,767
Chatty?

508
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:54,500
You know how class presidents
wrote down names

509
00:53:54,567 --> 00:53:57,333
of the students who were chatty?

510
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:58,900
My name was always on the list.

511
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:03,967
-What about you?
-I was...

512
00:54:05,667 --> 00:54:08,433
I was the one writing the names
of the chatty students.

513
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:09,767
I was a leader back then too.

514
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:17,200
What did you want to be as a child?

515
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:21,700
Superman.

516
00:54:22,734 --> 00:54:26,066
It was my dream to catch
even the villains in space.

517
00:54:26,133 --> 00:54:27,433
You were ambitious.

518
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:31,700
I thought I could fly
if I practiced a bit more.

519
00:54:31,767 --> 00:54:34,934
So I jumped off passionately.

520
00:54:36,033 --> 00:54:36,934
Then what happened?

521
00:54:37,533 --> 00:54:40,100
Well... The result was terrible.

522
00:54:40,166 --> 00:54:43,066
I got scrapes and broken bones.

523
00:54:44,133 --> 00:54:46,867
I managed to put up with you,
thanks to that experience.

524
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:51,400
Put up with me? You're dramatic.

525
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:57,467
Gosh.

526
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,467
This feels like someone else's patio.

527
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:04,166
Someone else's? What do you mean?

528
00:55:04,233 --> 00:55:05,533
Well...

529
00:55:06,567 --> 00:55:08,734
I'm sitting on my patio as usual,

530
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:12,266
but it feels different
because I'm with you.

531
00:55:14,033 --> 00:55:14,900
So...

532
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:17,600
Do I make you feel uncomfortable?

533
00:55:17,967 --> 00:55:19,667
That's not what I meant.

534
00:55:20,433 --> 00:55:21,700
It's just that...

535
00:55:23,266 --> 00:55:26,700
I wonder if the sky has always
looked this beautiful from here

536
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:30,166
and if the neighborhood always
sparkled like this.

537
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:35,600
That's what I meant.

538
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:41,033
So you're saying that
even if you're doing nothing,

539
00:55:42,066 --> 00:55:45,300
it's nice because you're with me?

540
00:55:49,266 --> 00:55:52,900
I was getting sick of Wangsuri Station,

541
00:55:54,433 --> 00:55:56,800
but it feels like a different station now.

542
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:00,600
What kind of nonsense is that?

543
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:15,834
Captain.

544
00:57:18,333 --> 00:57:19,767
I saw him.

545
00:57:19,834 --> 00:57:22,000
-Who are you talking about?
-Fruit Knife.

546
00:57:22,066 --> 00:57:24,233
I ran after him but lost him
because of the crowd.

547
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:25,500
Fruit Knife? Are you sure?

548
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:28,333
We've been after him for so long.
I'm sure it was him.

549
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:29,266
Who's that?

550
00:57:29,333 --> 00:57:31,200
He's a pickpocket
who carries a fruit knife.

551
00:57:31,266 --> 00:57:32,567
About a year ago,

552
00:57:32,633 --> 00:57:34,233
a drunk passenger woke up and grabbed him,

553
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:35,667
and he stabbed the guy and ran.

554
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:39,800
Since then, he's been lying low,
and it became an unresolved case.

555
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,767
Bastard. I'll get him.

556
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:45,033
But since he used a knife,

557
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:48,934
he was considered a robber,
so the Violent Crimes Team took the case.

558
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:49,834
So...

559
00:57:50,867 --> 00:57:53,767
Shouldn't we hand this case
over to the Violent Crimes Team?

560
00:57:57,700 --> 00:58:01,133
We also have the right
to investigate violent crime cases.

561
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:03,734
Let's investigate ourselves.

562
00:58:05,667 --> 00:58:08,600
We have the right to investigate
and the ability to do so.

563
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:11,667
We're more than capable.

564
00:58:12,533 --> 00:58:15,600
Then shall we go undercover
starting today?

565
00:58:15,667 --> 00:58:17,500
We'll ride the subway...

566
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,600
from the first train to the last one!

567
00:58:58,533 --> 00:58:59,367
Sir.

568
00:59:03,867 --> 00:59:04,700
Sir.

569
00:59:18,767 --> 00:59:22,333
Fruit Knife. It's been a long time.
You still have the same hairstyle.

570
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:23,533
Damn it, you...

571
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:27,133
Hey!

572
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:29,533
-What's going on here?
-What?

573
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:32,066
-How long have you been here?
-Three stations before you got on.

574
00:59:32,133 --> 00:59:35,166
Why did you go over to him?
I have so much jewelry on me.

575
00:59:35,233 --> 00:59:36,800
It's because we have the experience.

576
00:59:36,867 --> 00:59:39,300
-He's a serial robber. It's our case.
-Jeez.

577
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:42,300
We're onto him, too.
I've already cuffed him.

578
00:59:42,367 --> 00:59:44,300
The person to cuff him first
takes the credit.

579
00:59:44,367 --> 00:59:45,400
Good job, Rookie.

580
00:59:45,467 --> 00:59:47,500
-Salute. Let's go.
-Let's go.

581
00:59:47,567 --> 00:59:48,900
-He's ours.
-What do you mean?

582
00:59:48,967 --> 00:59:50,433
-Where are we?
-On the subway.

583
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:52,200
Then it's our jurisdiction. Let go!

584
00:59:52,266 --> 00:59:54,200
-Let go!
-Don't hold back, Rookie.

585
00:59:54,266 --> 00:59:55,200
Hey!

586
00:59:56,367 --> 00:59:57,767
Let go.

587
00:59:58,367 --> 00:59:59,834
-You little...
-It's ours!

588
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:01,166
Let go.

589
01:00:01,233 --> 01:00:02,467
Hey!

590
01:00:02,533 --> 01:00:08,533
{\an8}THANK YOU FOR WATCHING CATCH THE GHOST

591
01:00:32,367 --> 01:00:33,867
CATCH THE GHOST
