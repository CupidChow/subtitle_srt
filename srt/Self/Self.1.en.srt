1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,343
I've to do this because of you..

2
00:00:41,753 --> 00:00:44,311
 

3
00:00:45,288 --> 00:00:47,710
I've to do this because of you..

4
00:00:59,177 --> 00:01:06,283
Hello everyone, My name is Tang,My dream to be solo artist will come true soon

5
00:01:06,861 --> 00:01:10,583
being able to audition with music record is really what i have been waiting for

6
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:14,189
I'll never let anything stand in my way.

7
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:27,343
Okay guys, we shall start if you're ready.

8
00:01:40,691 --> 00:01:44,782
When our heart's calling

9
00:01:45,309 --> 00:01:47,309
When will the love come..

10
00:01:50,775 --> 00:01:55,180
I can't find out why

11
00:01:55,758 --> 00:01:58,461
Like our hearts want it to be

12
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:05,283
so i try searching for something i'm not sure of

13
00:02:05,883 --> 00:02:08,830
to understand

14
00:02:33,563 --> 00:02:40,303
Wow!! you're both pretty good.
but what's wrong with you today Tang?

15
00:02:40,303 --> 00:02:44,443
Why didn't you sent audition video in the duet version? why the solo one?

16
00:02:44,443 --> 00:02:46,882
He can only do the basics.

17
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:52,001
 May are very good at this almost like a pro

18
00:02:52,403 --> 00:02:53,656
 thank you

19
00:02:53,784 --> 00:02:58,378
 But umm.. just a little comment for you, Tang, I want you to make more "eye contact"

20
00:02:58,503 --> 00:03:01,963
 or you can practice it in front of the mirror

21
00:03:01,963 --> 00:03:04,683
 If you stay this way, I think it's not attractive though

22
00:03:04,683 --> 00:03:08,163
 

23
00:03:08,163 --> 00:03:09,795
 

24
00:03:09,795 --> 00:03:13,227
 Uhh, but he's usually very good at this

25
00:03:13,553 --> 00:03:16,683
 oh yes i think he a little tired today

26
00:03:18,692 --> 00:03:21,703
 Or.. you have an insomnia? I think you look a bit run-down today

27
00:03:21,703 --> 00:03:27,363
 Or.. you have an insomnia? I think you look a bit run-down today

28
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:29,763
tomorrow just do it like today

29
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,723
 I will sent you the link

30
00:03:33,723 --> 00:03:35,823
 and there will be chief producer joining online too

31
00:03:35,823 --> 00:03:39,325
 So.. Tang and May, please be well-prepared okay?

32
00:03:39,325 --> 00:03:41,083
 Ok.. ok

33
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:44,612
And don't forget .Practise in front of the mirror more..  

34
00:03:44,612 --> 00:03:50,048
 like a lot more and try to entertain the producer too okay? See you bye.

35
00:03:50,048 --> 00:03:52,048
 

36
00:03:53,338 --> 00:03:57,023
 See! and you plan to let me play the cord

37
00:03:57,023 --> 00:04:01,703
 But got asked to be the duo, I think I have a chance to be an popstar.

38
00:04:01,703 --> 00:04:05,675
 but normally, did the artist like have to practise in front of the mirror? I just know that

39
00:04:07,483 --> 00:04:10,166
 Oh! Baimon.. Jack.. you guys come to rehearse?

40
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:14,019
 Yes, and hey.. isn't that P'Nep from Sky Records?

41
00:04:14,923 --> 00:04:18,043
 I heard both of you play and it was fantastic

42
00:04:18,043 --> 00:04:20,117
 It's like listen to 

43
00:04:21,574 --> 00:04:23,574
 Can we do back-up for your band then?

44
00:04:25,533 --> 00:04:30,000
 Woah so you guys would be my back-up? please don't be bothered.

45
00:04:30,489 --> 00:04:34,303
 No! there's no problem, we are more than ready to play for you!

46
00:04:34,403 --> 00:04:38,410
 I mean don't bother me, iterally. It's quite disgusting for my audiences to see you both

47
00:04:38,887 --> 00:04:40,529
 Go make yourself look better

48
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:43,071
 Tang....

49
00:04:43,071 --> 00:04:43,819
 Why?

50
00:04:44,623 --> 00:04:49,036
 you want me to look at you right? here it's not that hard.

51
00:04:56,003 --> 00:04:59,243
 my friend are just foul-mouted, don't mind him

52
00:04:59,243 --> 00:05:03,392
 Just keep fighting okay? I know you guys are so good! I can't wait to see you guys on the stage

53
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:15,663
 Er.. Tang.. I think what P'Nep said is quite right.

54
00:05:15,663 --> 00:05:20,223
 when you perform, ypu seem to focusing on yourself but not the audience

55
00:05:20,223 --> 00:05:24,203
 have you tried practicing in front of the mirror like P'nep said

56
00:05:24,203 --> 00:05:27,863
 Why are you guys so serious?? It's gonna be an online audition..

57
00:05:27,863 --> 00:05:30,503
 I just have to look into the camera, not the judges

58
00:05:30,503 --> 00:05:31,980
 That's it. 

59
00:05:32,683 --> 00:05:34,683
 

60
00:05:34,743 --> 00:05:36,780
 so you gonna be a jerk now?

61
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,463
 What the heck is wrong with you guys?

62
00:05:39,141 --> 00:05:42,999
 why? so you got some compliment then you gonna brag it on me?

63
00:05:44,983 --> 00:05:52,777
 Hey/ Tang where are you going?

64
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:55,164
 that's more than enough/ but i'm just joking

65
00:05:56,143 --> 00:05:59,072
 how did the facial and acne treatment go?

66
00:06:03,483 --> 00:06:05,803
 Actually, your face looks really brighter.

67
00:06:05,803 --> 00:06:07,863
 So much better than the last time 

68
00:06:07,863 --> 00:06:12,503
 But I think get a less sleep lately

69
00:06:12,503 --> 00:06:14,417
 someone said that me face look a bit run down so i'm not very confident about it

70
00:06:14,517 --> 00:06:18,947
 Okay I got you, let's go up stairs to do the acne treatment.

71
00:06:58,643 --> 00:07:02,612
 just practice it in front of the mirror please Tang?

72
00:08:18,738 --> 00:08:20,257
 I didn't do it

73
00:08:21,739 --> 00:08:23,739
 i didn't kim P'foei

74
00:09:08,063 --> 00:09:10,523
 Hey guys look!

75
00:09:10,523 --> 00:09:11,023
 

76
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,422
 i can't see myself

77
00:09:14,943 --> 00:09:17,287
 I see you, normally

78
00:09:17,287 --> 00:09:19,287
 Hey look

79
00:09:20,141 --> 00:09:24,577
 It's ordinary / What's wrong with you?

80
00:09:26,403 --> 00:09:32,163
 

81
00:09:32,163 --> 00:09:35,763
 Really mess up, come sit here I'll brush for you

82
00:09:35,763 --> 00:09:41,203
 Are you run to here? 
Have you been to the wild? the war?

83
00:09:41,203 --> 00:09:44,803
 Hey dude, I'm serious I can't see my reflaction

84
00:09:44,803 --> 00:09:48,863
 I think it's clear now/ what? This dude has a artist phobia

85
00:09:48,863 --> 00:09:52,583
 He's going to be the artist, so he has to have a weird phobia

86
00:09:53,261 --> 00:09:56,803
I practicing/ i get it i've seen some celebrility afraid of orange. Afraid of tomatoes, something like that. 

87
00:09:57,004 --> 00:09:59,368
 But you're so chic!

88
00:09:59,368 --> 00:10:00,676
 I'm serious

89
00:10:01,631 --> 00:10:06,460
 Ok i believe you now.but it's not like even if you can't see yourself you still think you look handsome

90
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:09,239
 No, it's not what you think

91
00:10:09,616 --> 00:10:10,118
 

92
00:10:11,483 --> 00:10:15,303

100
00:11:14,603 --> 00:11:20,363
 Hi everyone from SKY record, I'm Tang and i'm 17 now

101
00:11:20,363 --> 00:11:21,994
 i'm come from saint august in chaing ma.and this is my friend, May

102
00:11:23,124 --> 00:11:25,124
 ..and this is my friend, May

103
00:11:25,124 --> 00:11:26,806
 I will play guitar

104
00:11:28,614 --> 00:11:33,650
 Hi, I am P'Job. If you guys ready then we can start now

105
00:11:47,063 --> 00:11:49,803
 Maybe it's just the wind slowly blowing through 

106
00:11:52,829 --> 00:11:56,329
 it might be the floating cloud in the sky

107
00:12:00,323 --> 00:12:07,063
 but how would it be to wait for love to come

108
00:12:13,271 --> 00:12:17,876
 Like a lost person among the crowd

109
00:12:19,595 --> 00:12:23,095
 It may just come and be gone in just a second we walk pass

110
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,500
 someone who i look into the eye

111
00:12:31,629 --> 00:12:33,466
 today might be exciting for you

112
00:12:33,466 --> 00:12:37,613
 I might need to leave now. Thanks so much for being with us today.

113
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,285
 what happen today?

114
00:12:43,285 --> 00:12:48,251
 i think your performance drop off a bit

115
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:49,697
 i'm really sorry 

116
00:12:49,823 --> 00:12:52,343
 Umm.. I think it's because of the online audition.. we're little stiff

117
00:12:52,343 --> 00:12:54,188
 It was May who changed the beat and didn't tell me

118
00:12:55,017 --> 00:12:57,017
 I told you he can only do the basics

119
00:12:58,483 --> 00:13:04,883
 It's gonna be ashamed if that's so.. okay okay

120
00:13:04,883 --> 00:13:09,383
 thanks both of you for today

121
00:13:09,383 --> 00:13:13,141
 until we meet again

122
00:13:13,643 --> 00:13:15,671
 but i haven't show you another song yet

123
00:13:16,123 --> 00:13:20,907
 after you upload the video on youtube, you send me the link then

124
00:13:22,841 --> 00:13:25,992
 ok / thank you / goodbye

125
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:29,102
 

126
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:36,543
 Tang talk to me!!

127
00:13:37,622 --> 00:13:39,622
 what the fuck is wrong with you

128
00:13:39,983 --> 00:13:44,043
 you said i changed the beat but actually you just trying to interrupt me 

129
00:13:44,043 --> 00:13:45,601
 I just answer it randomly.

130
00:13:45,601 --> 00:13:47,601
 Don't be so silly

131
00:13:47,601 --> 00:13:52,563
 Randomly? Random my ass! WTF? This is since you told them about the composer of the song

132
00:13:52,563 --> 00:13:56,063
 i let you take all the credit to yourself

133
00:13:57,093 --> 00:14:00,783
 Only chord without lyrics.. do you want to play Classic?

134
00:14:00,783 --> 00:14:02,548
 did you think it through

135
00:14:02,548 --> 00:14:04,103
 Hey!! Calm down, let's not have a figth!

136
00:14:05,763 --> 00:14:10,203
 Nam-mei!! I already told you right? He's a jerk and can not change! 

137
00:14:10,354 --> 00:14:11,734
 That's why you don't have any friends left

138
00:14:12,412 --> 00:14:13,734
 you are such a foul-mouthed

139
00:14:13,743 --> 00:14:16,813
 hey!! calm down and listen to me

140
00:14:16,813 --> 00:14:21,772
 so the first song, you wrote the cords, and you wrote the lyrics right? This song's credit is for you both. 

141
00:14:22,023 --> 00:14:25,136
 Then.. why do you guys have to fight

142
00:14:25,136 --> 00:14:26,743
 you guys said you would help me out on the audition

143
00:14:26,743 --> 00:14:29,184
 why did you ruin "my" show

144
00:14:29,184 --> 00:14:32,763
 huh!! "your" stupid show i don't want any of it

145
00:14:32,763 --> 00:14:35,903
 I helped you a lot and you aren't even grateful!

146
00:14:35,903 --> 00:14:37,617
 It's because I couldn't see my reflect!

147
00:14:37,617 --> 00:14:39,617
 calm down!! /  you are still as disgusting as you used to be 

148
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:41,617
Tang!!!!!

149
00:14:43,593 --> 00:14:45,966
 I'm done with you

150
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,532
 Tang.. please go talk to May..

151
00:15:32,003 --> 00:15:36,936

 I'll fucking kill you all..

157
00:15:53,563 --> 00:15:57,750
 Who the hell are you? Is it because of you? that i can't see myself in the mirror

158
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,979
 I'll fucking kill you ..

159
00:16:04,135 --> 00:16:05,356
