Where did the cat "Meow" go? 

9
00:00:58,053 --> 00:01:00,963
I think Neo has slaughtered it already.

10
00:01:01,082 --> 00:01:03,250
Damn, he's a psycho.

11
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:06,423
I guess you're the next one to be killed.

12
00:01:06,542 --> 00:01:08,539
What the fuck?? Take back what you said!!

13
00:01:09,422 --> 00:01:11,231
Fuck..the psycho's here.

14
00:01:22,587 --> 00:01:24,445
(Killer)

15
00:01:24,991 --> 00:01:27,294
Okay...you guys have already matched up , right?

16
00:01:27,723 --> 00:01:30,615
Today, we are going to talk about "Resultant force of an equilibrium.

17
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:34,934
And at the end of the class, we will study "Circular motion" also.

18
00:01:35,602 --> 00:01:36,314
Hey, teacher

19
00:01:37,077 --> 00:01:38,298
I don't have a partner yet.

20
00:01:38,823 --> 00:01:40,919
Can we do a group of three?

21
00:01:41,158 --> 00:01:42,919
Me, Mark and Kla together.

22
00:01:43,162 --> 00:01:45,983
Why so complicated? Neo was sitting alone.

23
00:01:45,983 --> 00:01:47,221
Go pair up with Neo one.

24
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:48,550
I don't want to, sir.

25
00:01:49,559 --> 00:01:52,950
If I pair with him... I wouldn't know if I will lose one of my hand or not.

26
00:01:53,289 --> 00:01:55,289
Hey, Mark! watch your mouth.

27
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:58,730
Or maybe... he will probably hit my head with a meter ruler.

28
00:01:59,126 --> 00:02:01,416
Like P'Fei.. who has been killed by...

29
00:02:03,993 --> 00:02:05,285
Please! Don't kill me

30
00:02:05,285 --> 00:02:06,047
Neo stop! /Neo.

31
00:02:06,285 --> 00:02:07,261
Do you want to die, huh?

32
00:02:07,589 --> 00:02:08,674
I told you I didn't do it.

33
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,841
Neo don't Neo...

34
00:02:16,463 --> 00:02:19,103
Between a promise and finding himself

35
00:02:29,347 --> 00:02:30,383
See you, Nam Mei

36
00:02:31,027 --> 00:02:31,834
Wait..

37
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:43,370
Mei.. can I ask you something?

38
00:02:44,997 --> 00:02:47,081
Just a sec, let me brush your hair first before asking me something.

39
00:02:47,892 --> 00:02:48,842
Can you turn around?

40
00:02:51,303 --> 00:02:52,574
What are you gonna ask me?

41
00:02:53,337 --> 00:02:56,005
Well... can you help me find someone?

42
00:02:57,178 --> 00:03:01,037
He's a student with "W.P." embroidery on his shirt.

43
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,204
W.P.?

44
00:03:03,681 --> 00:03:06,000
Wiang Panya Lamphun High School?

45
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,097
Whoa!!! So.. your target is in the Lamphun now?

46
00:03:10,075 --> 00:03:12,175
No.. it's man actually

47
00:03:12,604 --> 00:03:15,125
Hmm!! So you're up to a man??? 

48
00:03:15,126 --> 00:03:16,683
Slow down, That's not what I mean

49
00:03:16,683 --> 00:03:21,064
No, I understand you. It's okay, the world is wide open and I'm just shocked.

50
00:03:21,183 --> 00:03:23,407
So.. where did you find this guy?

51
00:03:26,253 --> 00:03:27,765
In the mirror..

52
00:03:28,099 --> 00:03:30,672
Mirror again? what's now

53
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:33,938
You can't see your own reflection in the mirror. And see his instead?

54
00:03:33,938 --> 00:03:34,984
How do you know??

55
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:36,443
What the hell?

56
00:03:36,443 --> 00:03:40,806
I'm just kidding, are you crazy or something?

57
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:41,873
Whatever

58
00:03:42,183 --> 00:03:44,767
You want me to find his social media right? Well,

59
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:48,651
there's a trade off

60
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:49,920
What???

61
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,630
You have to promise me that you're going to apologize May this evening.

62
00:03:52,773 --> 00:03:54,324
And make it up

63
00:03:55,565 --> 00:03:57,973
What does it have to do with me asking you to help me find someone?

64
00:03:59,023 --> 00:04:00,389
Then, do it yourself

65
00:04:02,059 --> 00:04:05,061
I... will go apologize may, okay?

66
00:04:05,809 --> 00:04:08,198
No...No, not "okay". 

67
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:10,387
You have to "promise" me you'll go apologize him.

68
00:04:10,649 --> 00:04:12,000
Well, I promise

69
00:04:12,415 --> 00:04:15,192
Yay!! Detective "Nam-mei" is on the mission.

70
00:04:15,693 --> 00:04:17,363
Is it a man or a woman??

71
00:04:17,363 --> 00:04:22,124
Man.. / Man? Randomly..

72
00:04:22,315 --> 00:04:25,413
This person? / No / Isn't him?

73
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:28,988
This person? / I told you it's a man...

74
00:04:30,283 --> 00:04:32,505
Sorry..

75
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:37,940
Is this person? / No / This is so tough...

76
00:04:39,202 --> 00:04:40,631
Is it this person?

77
00:04:41,872 --> 00:04:43,797
Hey!! Yes, yes!

78
00:04:44,362 --> 00:04:46,483
this is that guy... you're so good at this

79
00:04:47,151 --> 00:04:48,797
Yeah.. and don't forget what you promise okay?

80
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:52,745
Yeah.. / yeah yeah yeah

81
00:04:57,953 --> 00:05:03,115
(heard from my friends in Lamphun that there's a student got push from the abandoned building. The guy who pushed him still out there! what is wrong with the world!!)

82
00:05:05,637 --> 00:05:09,337
I will kill you, bastards

83
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:15,194
(Isn't that from Wiang Panya Lamphun???)

84
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:17,604
(Hey! it's about Neo and Fei!!) 

85
00:05:18,368 --> 00:05:21,680
(The police said that there is no evidence that Neo push Fei, wasn't that so?)

86
00:05:22,078 --> 00:05:25,178
(Why he's still out there?? The school should punish him or something!)

87
00:05:30,043 --> 00:05:32,231
Do you have family issue?

88
00:05:33,305 --> 00:05:34,756
Why didn't your parents come?

89
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,927
Apart from that high school senior, are there any other problems?

90
00:05:42,401 --> 00:05:43,880
Neo, do you know that you're wrong?

91
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:48,766
no matter what your friends say, but you shouldn't act in a violent manner.

92
00:05:51,687 --> 00:05:54,267
During the time you got suspended.... go clean yourself.

93
00:05:55,914 --> 00:05:58,380
About Mark, I will compromise his parents.

94
00:05:59,382 --> 00:06:00,857
But that's all I can help.

95
00:06:33,136 --> 00:06:34,120
Hey.. man.

96
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:35,690
Yes?

97
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,050
Do you know someone named "Neo"??

98
00:06:39,102 --> 00:06:40,562
Why are you looking for Neo?

99
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:41,799
Oh well...

100
00:06:42,781 --> 00:06:44,662
I'm a school reporter from Chiang Mai.

101
00:06:47,334 --> 00:06:48,690
Are you a reporter?

102
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:52,100
That thing about Neo killed a senior in school?

103
00:06:53,126 --> 00:06:53,977
Hmm...

104
00:06:54,131 --> 00:06:56,553
but I got the rumors that Neo didn't do it?

105
00:06:57,412 --> 00:06:59,865
Bro! the school's just covering it up.

106
00:07:00,943 --> 00:07:04,829
This guy didn't just kill seniors in school. He also picked on his classmate and had a fight.

107
00:07:04,948 --> 00:07:06,958
Now he has been suspended from school.

108
00:07:10,992 --> 00:07:14,123
Are you really a reporter? Seems like you barely know anything

109
00:07:14,243 --> 00:07:17,748
Of course! Umm.. I'm a trainee reporter.

110
00:07:18,573 --> 00:07:21,169
Hey, do you his address?

111
00:07:21,803 --> 00:07:23,340
I know, bro...

112
00:07:24,771 --> 00:07:28,250
But if I tell you, I don't know how you gonna write about this.

113
00:07:32,664 --> 00:07:33,781
100 Baht, deal?

114
00:07:34,003 --> 00:07:37,325
Come on!! I don't want it

115
00:07:37,587 --> 00:07:42,534
How can I be sure that you're not gonna destroy my school's reputation?

116
00:07:43,059 --> 00:07:46,163
Dude, just tell the me the truth if you didn't know.

117
00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:47,883
I don't have time for this.

118
00:07:50,075 --> 00:07:51,264
Bro!!

119
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:56,479
I can tell you... he lives in Kittitat dorm.

120
00:07:59,467 --> 00:08:03,759
2nd floor, near the stairs, room 201

121
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:06,674
It's a bit shabby.

122
00:08:07,123 --> 00:08:10,582
Why did you know so thoroughly? Are you teasing me?

123
00:08:11,512 --> 00:08:12,582
I'm really telling you the truth!

124
00:08:13,683 --> 00:08:14,652
Well, I used to be close to him.

125
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:19,549
But since that happened.. I started to get away from him.

126
00:08:21,648 --> 00:08:24,698
Ok, brother. Thank you very much. See you around

127
00:09:09,438 --> 00:09:10,916
Hello..

128
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:15,123
Tang, where are you? I'm waiting here at the coffee shop next to the school.

129
00:09:15,123 --> 00:09:17,610
Well, I saw you didn't answer LINE so I call

130
00:09:20,473 --> 00:09:21,299
(Mom)

131
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,998
(Mark)

132
00:09:39,974 --> 00:09:41,220
Where you think you going?

133
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,120
What are you guys doing?

134
00:09:43,438 --> 00:09:44,555
Where are you going?

135
00:09:44,892 --> 00:09:46,020
What did you do to me?

136
00:09:46,664 --> 00:09:47,618
What did you do???

137
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,859
Uh, I'll be there in a moment... Uh, uh, okay

138
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:58,291
You bastards!

139
00:10:01,297 --> 00:10:02,898
You see this? wanna die so bad, huh?

140
00:10:03,661 --> 00:10:04,161
Don't!!!!!!

141
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,981
Maybe half an hour, just a moment..

142
00:10:10,911 --> 00:10:12,169
No!!!!

143
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:16,367
You went too far this time!!. / Why did you do that??

144
00:10:18,538 --> 00:10:19,209
Let's go

145
00:10:22,525 --> 00:10:24,599
See you soon. / Ok,

146
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:26,710
(Nam-Mei)

147
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:55,316
Excuse me, we will close in five minutes.

148
00:10:56,258 --> 00:10:57,653
Oh okay.

149
00:10:58,607 --> 00:11:00,822
Nam-Mei, I don't think Tang will be here.

150
00:11:02,146 --> 00:11:03,246
...I understand you

151
00:11:03,648 --> 00:11:05,171
I know you give it all to him

152
00:11:05,675 --> 00:11:07,347
but If there's nothing coming back...

153
00:11:07,973 --> 00:11:09,257
I think that's enough.

154
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,950
Are you leaving now?

155
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:16,412
What's the point to wait for him? The shop is gonna close now.

156
00:11:19,126 --> 00:11:20,859
If you gonna wait, just wait. I'll leave now.

157
00:12:17,859 --> 00:12:19,125
Tang : Hey, my battery was dead so I couldn't answer your phone.

158
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:20,328
Nam-mei : You okay right?

159
00:12:20,456 --> 00:12:22,549
Tang : Yeah, I went to see you guys but the shop has already closed.

160
00:12:27,173 --> 00:12:28,939
(May left the chat group)

161
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:36,292
He lives in Kittitat dorm. 2nd floor, near the stairs, room 201. It's a bit shabby.

162
00:14:01,538 --> 00:14:04,680
June : Hey, it's me "June" we met this evening :P. 
This is the clip of Neo hitting his friend.

163
