1
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:42,292
THIS DRAMA IS A WORK OF FICTION.
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,

2
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,961
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGIONS, AND INCIDENTS
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:51,509
Min-cheol, are you really thinking of
reporting me to the prosecution?

4
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:54,345
You received bribes
and let them off the hook so many times.

5
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:55,722
Oh, come on.

6
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:58,892
Do you think I took that money
because I wanted to?

7
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,352
As you already know, I have three kids.

8
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:02,854
I only took it a few times

9
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:05,315
so I could pay my eldest kid's tuition.

10
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:08,651
That will end up becoming a habit,
and you'll eventually get caught.

11
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,070
Haven't you seen our superiors?

12
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:12,739
And don't you think you're being
an embarrassing dad?

13
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:14,741
Who do you think you are?

14
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:16,659
What about you? Are your hands clean?

15
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:18,745
How could you report your own partner?

16
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:20,663
Yes, my hands are clean.

17
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:24,667
Dae-yong, you really need
to get your head straight!

18
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,753
An armed robbery has occurred
in Yangjae-dong.

19
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:29,088
The suspect is on the run. We need backup.

20
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:30,799
Aren't you going to get to work?

21
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,903
We have eyes on the suspect!

22
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:53,863
He's on the first basement floor!

23
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,449
The suspect has a knife,
and I'm being threatened!

24
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:58,576
I need backup right now!

25
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:11,297
Drop the knife, you jerk!

26
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:13,633
No!

27
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:19,055
You bastard! Drop the knife!

28
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:27,480
You bastard!

29
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:33,862
You asshole!

30
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:38,491
Dae-yong.

31
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:04,809
Dae-yong...

32
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:07,812
It's okay.

33
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:09,480
Dae-yong...

34
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:14,819
It's okay.

35
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:43,723
What?

36
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,517
How did you...

37
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,771
It took me a lot of effort to find this.

38
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,649
I noticed you went through a lot

39
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,901
to get rid of the evidence.

40
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:59,447
What would happen
if I took this to the police?

41
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:03,117
The statute of limitations
hasn't expired yet.

42
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:06,537
So you'll surely get charged
for abetting murder.

43
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:12,752
Should I start out by sending this
to Detective Park's family?

44
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:19,008
Or I could just send it
to your family instead.

45
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:22,679
If your family finds out

46
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,474
what kind of person you really are,

47
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,310
they'll be very shocked.

48
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:34,941
What do you want?

49
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:38,069
I need someone

50
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,239
in the police force to help me.

51
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:42,991
And I think

52
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,326
you're perfect for the job.

53
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:48,663
I won't be asking for much.

54
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:05,847
You just need to forge a case for me.

55
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:14,314
DISCLOSURE

56
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:16,983
Why did you do it?

57
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,570
Ho-gyu.

58
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,698
Why did you kill him?

59
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:30,330
Me?

60
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:32,999
You didn't do it?

61
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,210
Tae-sik.

62
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,838
I understand that people make mistakes.

63
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,967
I understand that you acted
in the heat of the moment.

64
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:45,136
But

65
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,181
you've gone too far.

66
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,018
Now, you can't undo this.

67
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,772
-Turn yourself in.
-What on earth are you talking about?

68
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,815
-Turn yourself in.
-Dae-yong.

69
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:00,735
I know you were at the scene
when Ho-gyu died.

70
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:02,653
I also know that the record
of my gun is gone.

71
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,157
Was it you

72
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,284
who killed Ho-gyu

73
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:11,412
and framed me for the murder?

74
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:14,665
Tae-sik, I really have

75
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,251
no idea what you're talking about.

76
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,671
Turn yourself in.

77
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,299
You can't be on the run forever.

78
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,426
Why did you do it?

79
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:27,595
Why?

80
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:33,142
How could you shoot Ho-gyu?

81
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,311
How could you do that?

82
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:38,981
Why...

83
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,317
Why did you do it?

84
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:47,740
I told you not to do it.

85
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:51,911
-What?
-I told you not to do it.

86
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:54,997
I asked you to turn a blind eye to it.

87
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,916
I even begged you.

88
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:01,420
Why didn't you listen to me? Why?

89
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,298
It's all your fault, you jerk!

90
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:08,344
If you had stopped back then,

91
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:10,972
I wouldn't have come this far.

92
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,142
Ho-gyu wouldn't have died,

93
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:16,978
and I wouldn't be
in this situation either!

94
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,189
What are you talking about?

95
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:22,733
Is this about Choe Su-hyeon?

96
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:27,113
Does that case have something to do
with why you turned out like this?

97
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:30,158
Who was it?

98
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,410
You'd never do something like this
on your own.

99
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,911
Who told you to do it?

100
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,330
Who's giving you orders?

101
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:38,332
Tell me.

102
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:42,670
Is it JQ Group?

103
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,507
Jeong Yeong-mun? In Dong-gu?
Jin Yeong-min?

104
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,510
Which one was it?
Or was it all three of them?

105
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:51,512
Tell me.

106
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:55,057
Who the hell is behind you?
Why are you going this far?

107
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:58,144
Even if I told you,

108
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:01,856
what can you do?

109
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:05,651
There's nothing you can do.

110
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,654
You don't know

111
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,699
how frightening they can be.

112
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,411
You don't know
what they're capable of doing.

113
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,039
Tae-sik.

114
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:20,750
Let's...

115
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:22,793
Let's drop it.

116
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:26,339
We need to stop here.

117
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,050
-Tae-sik.
-How...

118
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:32,929
How could you do this?

119
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:42,855
Who's there?

120
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,026
Are you okay?

121
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,200
Excuse me, sir.

122
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:56,369
Are you okay?

123
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,163
-Yes, I'm okay.
-Oh, dear.

124
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:01,207
I'm fine.

125
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:34,865
Detective Jo.

126
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:40,997
Detective Jo, are you here?

127
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,634
Hey, Detective Kang. It's me.

128
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,137
Detective Jo isn't here. Do you know--

129
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,056
I think the guy who killed Ho-gyu
and framed Detective Jo

130
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,142
-was our captain.
-What?

131
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,811
Detective Jo suddenly left
as soon as he heard that.

132
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:30,963
-You haven't eaten, have you?
-No.

133
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,174
-What did you bring?
-Dumplings.

134
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,220
By the way, shouldn't you be
at your new office by now?

135
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,764
Yes, I know.

136
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,808
But I need to get this done
before I leave.

137
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:48,522
-Did you drink?
-Yes.

138
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,358
With whom?

139
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:53,361
You never drink with me,
so I drank by myself.

140
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:57,281
Gosh, you're such a loser.
You're really pathetic.

141
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,117
Will you please go home?

142
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:03,412
Hey.

143
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:05,373
-Stop it.
-Tae-sik.

144
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:07,124
-Hey, stop it.
-Tae-sik.

145
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:11,879
It's not easy, is it?

146
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,385
Fate is so cruel.

147
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:20,012
It hasn't even been that long
since your sister died.

148
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,223
And now, your mother?

149
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,600
Fate really is merciless.

150
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:30,481
Hey, how about I go and see your mother

151
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:34,235
and make her laugh?
Don't you think that'll cheer her up?

152
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:36,779
Should I do that for her?

153
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,823
"Laughter is the best medicine."
How is that?

154
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:41,242
What do you think?

155
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:42,952
Is it a bad idea?

156
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,540
Fine, let's go. My gosh, seriously.

157
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,418
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

158
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,921
You know I hate you, right?

159
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:55,256
-Of course.
-Really?

160
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:56,924
But I probably hate you even more.

161
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,175
-Really?
-Yes.

162
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,427
I'm a bit offended.

163
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,637
-Let's go.
-Let's have some soju.

164
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,806
Yes, that's what I'm talking about.

165
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:05,891
Aren't you too full though?

166
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:08,018
Don't worry. I can drink some more.

167
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,895
-Oh, gosh.
-Why? What's wrong?

168
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,107
-The dumplings.
-They've already turned cold.

169
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,443
So what? We can still eat them.

170
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:03,949
Four o'clock.

171
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:08,078
Yes, this is Dongrok Precinct Station.

172
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:12,041
Okay, I'll be right there. Bye.

173
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:15,669
Is someone drunk again?

174
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:17,755
Yes, I'll see you when I get back.

175
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,089
Okay, see you.

176
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:44,990
Did you bring it?

177
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,120
CALL LOGS
YU DAE-YONG

178
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:52,456
It's the captain's call logs
starting from the beginning of

179
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,749
Choe Su-hyeon's case until now.

180
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,376
Thanks.

181
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:57,628
How is that going to help you
at this point?

182
00:13:57,711 --> 00:13:59,797
If Dae-yong has been working
for JQ all this time,

183
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,715
there should be
some kind of a call record.

184
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:03,759
I need to find out

185
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:06,929
who's behind this
and where things started to go wrong.

186
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:11,559
I want you to find out
whom he was talking to on the phone

187
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,060
when Ho-gyu died.

188
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,271
You're unbelievable.

189
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,816
I can't believe you're still
sane enough to investigate.

190
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:23,737
I honestly don't care who made him do it.
The fact that our captain

191
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:29,243
killed Ho-gyu and tried to frame you
for his death is more shocking to me.

192
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,579
I can't even sleep at night

193
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,497
because I get so angry
thinking about that.

194
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:36,792
The person who died could've been me.
It could've happened to you too.

195
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,253
Ho-gyu just got unlucky.

196
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:43,132
That innocent punk

197
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,634
had to die because he just got unlucky.

198
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:48,804
How can you be so cold-hearted?

199
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,181
-Jin-gyeong.
-You know how I felt?

200
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,851
I just wanted to get a knife
and kill everyone who did this

201
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:56,395
including the captain
and the guys working at JQ.

202
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:58,314
Then should I just kill them all?

203
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:01,650
Should we kill them
just like how they killed Ho-gyu?

204
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,194
I guess we'll just get caught
and go to prison.

205
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,863
-Tae-sik.
-Listen to me.

206
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:08,866
We need to find out

207
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,745
why Ho-gyu had to die like that.

208
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:17,583
Do you think I'm being like this
because I'm okay with what happened?

209
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,046
Rather than beating the shit out of them,

210
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:24,798
I'd rather

211
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,093
take responsibility for Ho-gyu's death.

212
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:32,181
Then I'll at least be able
to face him later on.

213
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:41,941
So don't

214
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,944
do anything rash.

215
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:49,281
Just keep an eye on Dae-yong and the guys
at the Regional Investigation Unit

216
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:50,991
and keep me updated about it.

217
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,788
Jin-gyeong.

218
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,457
We're the only people

219
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,167
who can do this.

220
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:12,763
There's a car parked over there
that can't be traced.

221
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:13,973
Be careful with it.

222
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:16,558
And you should go and see Ms. Kim.

223
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:19,019
She's been looking for you
ever since last night.

224
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:20,896
I'll be off now.

225
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:33,450
WE WELCOME THE NEW RENEWABLE
ENERGY BUSINESS COMPLEX

226
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:42,042
-Lower it a little bit more.
-Okay.

227
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:54,346
At first,

228
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:57,850
I thought I had anemia.

229
00:16:58,434 --> 00:16:59,685
But when I went to the hospital,

230
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,605
they told me I had terminal lung cancer.

231
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:08,986
I even went to a shaman
hoping she might be able to help me.

232
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:13,866
I tried all sorts of things,
but they were all useless.

233
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,161
And now,

234
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,748
I don't even have much money left.

235
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,544
I wouldn't even have been able
to afford the medicine

236
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,505
if it wasn't for JQ Hospital's help.

237
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:35,054
I heard

238
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:40,601
that's the hospital's new welfare policy.

239
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:42,352
SUPPORTED BY JQ

240
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:45,689
They offered to pay
for all of my medical expenses.

241
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:48,942
I really can't thank them enough.

242
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,819
JQ PAID ALL THE EXPENSES

243
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:10,881
Hello, I have a question to ask.

244
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:15,302
Are these patients currently
getting treated here?

245
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:17,054
Just a second.

246
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:22,768
PATIENT INFORMATION

247
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:26,980
Yes, these patients are
getting treated at our hospital.

248
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:29,191
But may I ask why you're asking this?

249
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:33,028
I noticed that the hospital's paying
for their medical expenses.

250
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:34,822
Can I ask why?

251
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:38,075
They're receiving financial aid
based on our hospital's welfare policy.

252
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:41,078
Their illnesses and financial situations
seem to vary a lot.

253
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,747
And I'm curious about who can receive aid.

254
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:48,961
I'm sorry, but it's against
the hospital rules to tell you that.

255
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:53,757
Then can I at least meet the doctor
who's in charge of these patients?

256
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:56,343
He's currently out of town
to attend a seminar.

257
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:58,220
You should make an appointment
and visit again.

258
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,473
Then can I look at their medical records?

259
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:05,185
We can't show that to anyone
other than the patients themselves.

260
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,440
CALL LOGS
YU DAE-YONG

261
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:11,567
An illegal cell phone.

262
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,319
The number is "248-7332."

263
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,655
I can't check whom the captain
was talking to on the phone

264
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:19,074
when Ho-gyu died. The person
was using an illegal cell phone.

That's when Choi Chi-deuk went missing.

268
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:32,254
March 19. The day Kim Pil-yeon died.

269
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,048
March 3. The day Kim Seung-cheol died.

270
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:40,304

YU DAE-YONG

Every time something happened,
he always called...

00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,270
The number "7332."

274
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:50,689
This is the guy Dae-yong's spying for.

275
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:04,286
Now that we're done
dealing with everything,

276
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:06,580
we just need to tear down the factory.

277
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,333
Once they pass the bill
at the end of this month,

278
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,460
we'll begin tearing down the RMC factory.

279
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,962
It'll take about two weeks to finish.

280
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:16,215
If things go as planned,

281
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:19,301
the groundbreaking of our new business
will be in the last week of next month.

282
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,265
You're living up to your new role.

283
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:26,934
You know how to push ahead.

284
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,149
How are Assemblywoman Kim and the cops?

285
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:37,527
Have you noticed anything in particular
after what happened?

286
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:39,738
They're being careful these days.

287
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:42,491
The team was changed as well.

288
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,202
And now that she's even had an accident,

289
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,497
it won't be easy for Seo-hui
to be reckless like she was before.

290
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:52,751
I've already agreed
to let you deal with that matter,

291
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,837
so I trust that you'll take care of it.

292
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:09,935
Just a second.

293
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:12,479
Hello?

294
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,859
I think it's going to take me
about an hour and a half.

295
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:21,029
Yes, I'll be there before then.

296
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:46,805
-Hello?
-I heard you looked for me.

297
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:49,266
Detective Jo? Where are you?

298
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,518
Let's meet at the empty house.

299
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,606
It won't be easy to catch him.

300
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:00,277
Tae-sik is a smart guy.

301
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:03,030
I've ordered my guys to look for him,

302
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:05,657
so give us some time.

303
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,161
About Detective Park Min-cheol...

304
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:12,914
Your partner who died ten years ago.

305
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:18,378
I suddenly got curious about
how his family is doing these days.

306
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,255
So I looked into it.

307
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,633
And they're living a difficult life.

308
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:25,927
They're even about to lose their house.

309
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:29,639
I bet it's been a while
since you last visited them.

310
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:35,645
Shouldn't you be helping them out?

311
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:38,774
You're responsible

312
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:41,735
for his death.

313
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,947
I guess you don't like talking about this.

314
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:51,328
But I can't help but think about that
every time I see you.

315
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:55,749
You left your partner to die,
and you seemed pretty tormented by that.

316
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:57,167
Enough!

317
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:00,253
I'm doing everything you ask.

318
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:07,094
Jo Tae-sik.

319
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:09,888
Why did you not get rid of him?

320
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:13,517
What did you two talk about?

321
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:18,605
Once you get rid of him,

322
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:21,817
the whole thing will be over.
That's what I said.

323
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:25,737
Tae-sik knows everything.

324
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:28,490
All about it.

325
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,119
Not just about Ho-gyu.
He knows the whole thing.

326
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:35,080
I guess

327
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:37,749
he already sensed

328
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:40,460
that we're involved.

329
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:46,883
Are you sure the captain

330
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:49,719
framed you for his doing?

331
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,056
He didn't do it alone.
There's someone behind him.

332
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,016
Who?

333
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:57,060
In Dong-gu.

334
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:02,065
It seems he's been in league with
In Dong-gu since Choe Su-hyeon's case.

335
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:04,860
Those who've been killed

336
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:07,487
might have something
to do with In Dong-gu.

337
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:10,615
But there's something strange.

338
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:13,076
What's strange?

339
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:17,497
Nothing. I heard
you found something from the list.

340
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:18,748
Right.

341
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:21,501
It turns out we were right about it.

342
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:25,297
All the people on the list
are seriously ill.

343
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:26,840
SUPPORTED BY JQ

344
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:28,800
"Medical expenses supported by JQ"?

345
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:30,427
Yes. The JQ Hospital in Songju

346
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,345
has been supporting
their medical expenses.

347
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:34,431
JQ has?

348
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:36,933
And...

349
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:42,856
I marked their addresses on a map.

350
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:47,986
SONGJU

351
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:49,112
Look.

352
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:52,240
This is the land for their new building.

353
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:55,076
-So they all live in the building site.
-Yes.

354
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:59,164
JQ is paying their medical expenses,

355
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:03,501
and Hong Min-guk is trying to let JQ

356
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:05,253
buy this land no matter what.

357
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:09,257
It's the land.

358
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,843
The secret is in this land.

359
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:16,973
The secret JQ is desperately
trying to hide.

360
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:26,149
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

361
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:32,697
Residents in a neighborhood
fell ill collectively?

362
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:36,409
Yes. I met them all one by one.

363
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:39,829
They have all kinds of cancer
like blood cancer and lung cancer.

364
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,498
Some of them had a miscarriage.

365
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:44,292
And there are young kids
who went blind or deaf.

366
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:49,172
About one fourth
of the people there are seriously ill.

367
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:51,091
How is that possible?

368
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:54,511
Are you sure about that?

369
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:58,306
Yes. Have you ever seen
anything like this before?

370
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:02,352
I have. It's an example
from abroad though.

371
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:06,273
I can't tell the exact cause
before checking their medical history,

372
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:08,566
but a collective disease like this

373
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:11,611
usually happens
due to a virus infection or pestilence.

374
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:15,490
But in the case you mentioned,
the types of diseases are too various.

375
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:16,950
Then...

376
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:20,328
It means there's only one possible cause.

377
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:29,379
When natural resources

378
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:34,467
such as air, soil, or water
are contaminated,

379
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:38,138
people who live in the neighborhood
are exposed to the pollution.

380
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:42,892
There's a good chance that resources
in the area are contaminated.

381
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:45,353
Resources shared by everyone.

382
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:50,442
We've talked to Mr. Park about the shares.

383
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:55,322
For the funds, he started to buy
stocks of JQ E&F.

384
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:58,074
All we need to do now
is win Mr. Gong over to our side.

385
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:02,120
Then we will be able to secure
all the stocks we need by next month.

386
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,580
Thank you for your hard work.

387
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:07,834
I'll meet with Mr. Gong.

388
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:09,836
Okay. I'll arrange an appointment.

389
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:13,840
And there's something you should see.

390
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:16,843
Here.

391
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:22,891
Assemblywoman Kim asked JQ Hospital

392
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:26,436
for the medical history of some patients.

393
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:28,855
Some patients?

394
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:33,985
I guess she's got the list of names.

395
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:38,573
So we've ended up like this.

396
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:40,200
What do we do?

397
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:42,202
Sir?

398
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:46,623
-Leave her be.
-Pardon?

399
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:50,752
Just leave her alone. Don't do anything.

400
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:53,755
-But...
-It will eventually help our plan.

401
00:27:56,633 --> 00:28:00,678
Chairman Jeong and Mr. In should
never know about this though.

402
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:02,430
Okay.

403
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:08,853
SUPPORTED BY JQ
JQ PAID ALL THE EXPENSES

404
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:24,744
The land is contaminated?
And that's why people fell ill.

405
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,956
Yes. We need to check
their medical history

406
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,666
in order to find the exact cause.

407
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:33,753
But the hospital wouldn't
share it with us.

408
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:36,089
I'll find a way.

409
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,467
You should look more deeply
into the contamination.

410
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:42,429
-Okay, I will.
-Be careful.

411
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:51,229
Hey.

412
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:53,606
Let's go.

413
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:55,358
Where are we going?

414
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:57,569
I took today off.

415
00:28:58,445 --> 00:28:59,904
What should we do now?

416
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:02,115
What? Why are you being
so enthusiastic all of a sudden?

417
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:04,200
I've thought about it.

418
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:07,162
I guess you are right.

419
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:11,291
Getting angry without doing anything

420
00:29:11,374 --> 00:29:13,376
won't bring Ho-gyu back.

421
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:16,129
I just have to do something.

422
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:25,138
I need the medical records
of the patients on this list.

423
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:27,557
But I can't get it in a legitimate manner.

424
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:31,561
Some of them went to smaller
local hospitals before JQ Hospital.

425
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:35,565
We might be able to get the records
from a small hospital like that.

426
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:38,443
I know it's only a local hospital,

427
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:40,278
but we can't ask for it without a warrant.

428
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:42,405
You just said we have to do something.

429
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:45,909
Your experience in the RIU
will finally pay off.

430
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:49,496
All right then.

431
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:56,586
CALL HISTORY

432
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:58,755
IN DONG-GU

433
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:01,591
Tae-sik knows everything.

434
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:10,683
Track a phone number.

435
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:13,311
Insurance fraud?

436
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:14,646
KANG JIN-GYEONG

437
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:19,651
His name is Park Jeong-ho.
and he's 56 years old.

438
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:22,070
-Do you have his medical records?
-What?

439
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,113
Just check and see if you have them.

440
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:29,536
PARK JEONG-HO

441
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:32,121
We do have them, but...

442
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:33,665
My goodness.

443
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:37,085
We got a report from the insurance company

444
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:40,880
that the patient conspired with a hospital
and collected his insurance illegally.

445
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,591
We are not involved.

446
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,802
I'm not saying it was this hospital.

447
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:49,681
We are just investigating
all the hospitals he's been to.

448
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:51,808
We need your cooperation.

449
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:54,769
-Cooperation?
-I need to see his medical records.

450
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:56,896
Now.

451
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:03,611
MEDICAL RECORD

452
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:05,321
Ms. No Jeong-sun?

453
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:14,080
If this hospital doesn't cooperate,
it may look suspicious.

454
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,041
MEDICAL RECORD

455
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:18,501
They all cooperated with us.

SONGJU PEDIATRICS

in Buheung-myeon, fish died en masse."

00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,654
there was damage to the crops."

suffered death en masse."

467
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:58,583
Songju RMC?

468
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,628
CEMENT DUST FROM SONGJU RMC

469
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:04,088
"Cement dust from Songju RMC.

470
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:06,215
Local residents protesting."

471
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:07,467
What is this?

472
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:10,553
Did Songju RMC contaminate the area?

473
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:19,354
Excuse me.

474
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:22,440
Can I take a look at the materials

475
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:24,150
about Songju RMC?

476
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:26,235
-Please wait a second.
-Okay.

477
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:30,239
So there's a chance that Songju RMC
might be the cause of contamination?

478
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:38,414
Yes. All the clues are pointing
to that place.

479
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:42,043
Fish and chickens in the area
died en masse before.

480
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:44,879
And residents suffered
a lot of crop damage.

481
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:47,840
They even went on a demonstration
because of the issue.

482
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:50,343
If it's about Songju RMC...

483
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,470
Kim Pil-yeon, Choi Chi-deuk...

484
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:55,598
They all have something
to do with Sang-hun's case.

485
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:58,434
So it was all about the contamination.

486
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:00,687
And

487
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:02,981
Kim Pil-yeon

488
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:05,692
was in charge of wastewater
management in the company.

489
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,617
It's an unidentified prepaid phone.

490
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:18,121
The call was made near your office.

491
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:23,751
DONGROK PRECINCT STATION

492
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:34,929
Hey.

493
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:38,099
You know it's not right.

494
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:40,393
You can't ask for medical records
without a warrant.

495
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:42,770
How many did you get?

496
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:44,647
-Thirty-four.
-Is that it?

497
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:48,901
I worked so hard to get this.
I even broke the law.

498
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:51,821
If it leaks out,
you and I will be doomed--

499
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:54,240
Okay. I'll just take pictures of it.

500
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:56,200
MEDICAL RECORD

501
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,828
You know I met Dr. Han.

502
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:00,538
Oh, right. How did it go?

503
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:03,124
There's a trace of a fight

504
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:05,001
before Ho-gyu's death.

505
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:08,963
But no other DNA was found.

506
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:12,508
This is driving me crazy.

507
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:14,886
What do we do to clear your name?

508
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:17,138
Was there anything else other than that?

509
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:18,431
Oh, right.

510
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,895
We found a piece of fiber under his nails.

511
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:26,981
-Fiber?
-But it's so small. I can't even see it.

512
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:29,567
There's no way we can catch
the criminal with it.

513
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:31,944
What was Dae-yong wearing that day?

514
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,615
I told you not to run.

515
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:46,292
Who are you?

516
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:51,672
Hello.

517
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:53,466
Why are you here again?

518
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:55,843
I need to ask you something
about Kim Pil-yeon.

519
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:58,429
I have nothing to tell you. Get out.

520
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:00,723
-Let's go inside.
-I heard Mr. Kim was

521
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:03,184
in charge of wastewater management.

522
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:04,894
Did you hear anything about it?

523
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:06,521
I don't know anything. Please leave.

524
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:08,189
This is important.

525
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:12,527
It might have something to do
with your husband's death.

526
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:15,488
Please do me a favor.

527
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:20,076
He never told me about his work.

528
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:24,122
He just wanted to leave this place.

529
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:28,668
Was it Mr. Kim

530
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:30,795
who blocked the faucet?

531
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:33,923
Dad told us not to drink it.
He sounded really upset.

532
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:58,656
Jo Tae-sik.

534
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:38,613
Hello.

535
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:41,324
Excuse me. May I ask you something?

536
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:43,951
I guess you use groundwater in this house.

537
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,369
Yes, I do.

538
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:48,664
Do people in this village
use groundwater a lot?

539
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:51,834
Of course. Most of them use it.

540
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:54,503
We all installed faucets
to use groundwater.

541
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:55,713
I see.

542
00:36:55,796 --> 00:36:57,632
-Yes.
-I went to Kim Pil-yeon's house.

543
00:36:58,132 --> 00:37:00,468
He blocked the faucet in the front yard

544
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:02,428
and told his family not to use it.

545
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:03,846
Stop right there.

546
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:06,015
Hey!

549
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:23,115
This is the map
for underground water in Songju.

550
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:24,742
Thank you.

551
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,286
Does the black line
show underground water?

552
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:31,040
Yes. It shows the stratum
of underground water local residents use.

553
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:33,125
What about the circles?

554
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:34,502
They are called tube wells.

555
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:37,004
They are like wells for underground water.

556
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,714
There are a lot of them only in this area.

557
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:43,135
It means people in this area use
underground water a lot.

558
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:47,640
Yeongil-myeon, Buheung-myeon,
Hagye-myeon...

559
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,609
YEONGIL-MYEON, BUHEUNG-MYEON,
HAGYE-MYEON

560
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:00,611
SONGJU

561
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:04,407
People living in the building site
for the new business

562
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,912
share the same underground water.

563
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,542
It's the water that's contaminated.

564
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:16,002
It's the water.

565
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:19,505
SONGJU JQ HOSPITAL
SPECIAL PATIENTS

566
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:21,882
Songju JQ Hospital has been trying

567
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,760
to grasp the number of people
with blood contamination

568
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:28,723
through free medical check-up service.

569
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:31,267
And the number

570
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:33,436
has been increasing, sir.

571
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,397
We even installed
the water supply and sewage system,

572
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,523
but it didn't work.

573
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:40,276
They keep using underground water

574
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:43,612
not to pay water bills.

575
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:48,326
They go crazy for free things
without thinking.

576
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:52,955
We're still in charge
of the water quality investigation,

577
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:55,249
so local residents in the lot

578
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:58,002
don't know anything about its harmfulness.

579
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:02,089
We will have to kick them out of the lot

580
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:03,632
if this continues to occur.

581
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:07,595
We never know
when environmental organizations

582
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:09,972
and civic groups will sense something.

583
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:11,682
We have to hurry

584
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:14,852
with the new business project

585
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:18,022
so no one can associate

586
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:20,232
the residents' diseases with the land.

587
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,818
Once the bill is passed tomorrow,

588
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:25,112
it won't be long
before the general meeting.

589
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:27,698
Please don't worry about it.

590
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:33,162
A few weeks feel like a really long time.

591
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:38,042
I hope nothing happens in the meantime.

592
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:40,044
I will make sure of that.

598

Mr. Yu.

599
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:19,208
Jo Tae-sik dropped
by the company yesterday.

600
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,962
I attached the footage in the email.
Please check.

601
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:34,515
Dad told us not to drink it.
He sounded really upset.

602
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:39,395
Kim Pil-yeon told his family
not to drink the groundwater.

603
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:42,273
Then, was the groundwater contaminated?

604
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:46,068
What on earth got leaked into the water

605
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:48,028
that so many people became sick?

606
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:54,535
MEDICAL RECORD

607
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:58,706
I don't understand the medical jargon.

608
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:17,766
It's a piece of fiber.

609
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:20,102
It's from the victim's nails.

610
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:22,688
But this is all I could find
about the suspect.

611
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:25,024
What was Dae-yong wearing that day?

612
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:30,029
I definitely ran into Captain that day.

613
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:37,244
Captain.

614
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:42,041
Ho-gyu...

615
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:46,170
What are we going to do?

616
00:41:56,138 --> 00:41:57,097
Yes?

617
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,478
Hey, Jin-gyeong.

618
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:04,104
Hello.

619
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:05,314
-Did you come alone?
-Yes.

620
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:07,566
Dae-yong sent me on an errand.

621
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:10,277
-He asked me to bring his jacket.
-I see. Come on in.

622
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:13,405
He could have called me
to bring the jacket.

623
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:15,032
He shouldn't have asked you.

624
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:16,951
I feel bad. You must be busy
with your own work.

625
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:19,119
Oh, no. I'm not busy at all.

626
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:20,579
I just follow his orders

627
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:22,831
whether he tells me to pick up stuff
or whatever.

628
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:24,500
But still.

629
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:26,502
This...

630
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:30,839
-Ma'am.
-Yes?

631
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:32,716
Could I have a cup of water?

632
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,387
Where are my manners? I haven't
even offered you a drink yet. Gosh.

633
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:38,722
This is what happens
when you live with Dae-yong.

634
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:40,432
-Give me a second.
-Okay.

635
00:42:43,852 --> 00:42:46,188
A dark gray jacket and a black T-shirt.

636
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:49,858
A dark gray jacket...

637
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:52,027
-This is the one.
-Jin-gyeong.

638
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:54,071
Have your pick. Coffee or green tea?

639
00:42:54,154 --> 00:42:55,656
-Green tea, please.
-Sure.

640
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:57,283
Please make it warm.

641
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:58,701
Sure.

642
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:09,128
GENE ANALYSIS LAB

643
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:10,921
Gosh, this is driving me insane.

644
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:14,550
What's taking so long?

645
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:31,233
You're still not done yet?

646
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,027
It'll be done soon.

647
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:34,570
Goodness.

648
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:38,073
So far, I haven't found any fiber

649
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:40,117
that matches the one
we found on the victim.

650
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:42,703
Keep trying.

651
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:26,121
We got him on camera when he was
exiting the tollgate in Songju.

652
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:27,873
After stopping at the JQ headquarters,

653
00:44:27,956 --> 00:44:29,333
he went back to Songju.

654
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:30,793
Songju.

655
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:33,420
I'm sure he has a hideout somewhere there.

656
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:37,633
Check every single dashcam
and security cameras nearby.

657
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:40,010
And get me his final destination.

658
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:50,896
Who is it?

659
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:53,565
It's too early for me to have a guest.

660
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:58,028
Wait.

661
00:44:58,570 --> 00:44:59,655
Hey.

662
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:00,989
Hey, you...

663
00:45:06,578 --> 00:45:08,247
Are you out of your mind?
Why are you here?

664
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:10,165
I have no one to turn to.
Only you can help me.

665
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:12,292
You trust me too much.
I'm about to call the police.

666
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:14,002
If you do, I'll just get arrested.

667
00:45:14,086 --> 00:45:15,712
-Shall I call?
-No.

668
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,798
Jeez.

669
00:45:19,007 --> 00:45:21,135
You're such a troublemaker.

670
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:26,598
Fine. What do you need me to do? Tell me.

671
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:29,393
Here.

672
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:31,520
This is it.

673
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:33,605
Please take a look.

674
00:45:34,731 --> 00:45:36,066
-Is this a medical record?
-Yes.

675
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:38,193
Can you check and see
if there's anything unusual?

676
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:40,737
A hematologic malignancy.

677
00:45:41,947 --> 00:45:43,115
A hematologic malignancy.

678
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:45,242
Uterine fibroids.

679
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,286
Brain tumor?

680
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:49,329
What's all this?

681
00:45:49,955 --> 00:45:51,498
-What do you think?
-What do I think?

682
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:52,541
I'm heartbroken.

683
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:54,626
All of these patients
have serious illnesses.

684
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:56,712
What's all this?

685
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,339
Medical records of people who reside

686
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,757
in a particular region.

687
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:02,926
What kind of area?
Why are there so many patients?

688
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:06,054
That's my point.
Can you take a closer look?

689
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:07,723
Is there anything unusual?

690
00:46:07,806 --> 00:46:09,558
There's no special reason
for getting sick.

691
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:14,521
Age, name, gender, and diagnosis.
Everything is different.

692
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:17,733
Perhaps, everyone got unlucky...

693
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:20,486
What?

694
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:22,654
-Hold on.
-There's something, right?

695
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:52,267
Look.

696
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:53,560
NOTES: CR6, PLUS

697
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:55,270
"Cr6, plus"?

698
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:56,438
Chromium.

699
00:46:57,105 --> 00:47:00,400
This means that they found chromium
in all of these patients' blood.

700
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,945
-Chromium?
-Zinc dichromate.

701
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:04,655
-What's that?
-Chromium.

702
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:06,406
So what is that exactly?

703
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:09,785
Don't you know?
Chromium means zinc dichromate.

704
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:11,161
Look.

705
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:14,873
It's in a group one carcinogen.

706
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:19,127
Hey, once this gets into your body,

707
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:20,295
you can't get it out.

708
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:21,630
That's how deadly it is.

709
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:27,386
You know what?
Unless they were forced to swallow this,

710
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:30,556
it's hard to find such a huge amount
in human bodies.

711
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:36,478
What on earth have you brought me?

712
00:47:44,778 --> 00:47:48,282
This explains how so many people
in that area got sick.

713
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:51,743
The level of hexavalent chromium
found in the water is too high.

714
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:53,954
-How high is it?
-Let me think.

715
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:55,581
How should I explain this to you?

716
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:57,332
Given the amount,

717
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:59,918
you ought to move
all the residents in that area.

718
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:04,381
Before that, they should get
a medical checkup.

719
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:06,466
If they have been exposed
for over 20 years,

720
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:07,884
-they are probably--
-Pardon?

721
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,012
How many years?

722
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:13,015
The residents have been exposed
to this for 20 years?

723
00:48:13,098 --> 00:48:16,184
Yes. They have probably been exposed
for 20 years, at least.

724
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:18,979
To measure the half-life
of the contamination,

725
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:22,357
we usually use the level of concentration
in the growth rings from the area.

726
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:25,319
I found hexavalent chromium
even in the inner ring.

727
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:29,531
We must conclude that the contamination
began around at least 20 years ago.

728
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:38,707
MASS DEATHS OF CHICKENS IN SONGJU

729
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:41,209
Songju RMC was built in 2004.

730
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:44,338
But the chickens died in 1999.

731
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:49,843
The contamination began
even before building Songju RMC.

732
00:48:52,804 --> 00:48:53,639
Then,

733
00:48:54,973 --> 00:48:57,392
it means the factory wasn't
the source of the contamination.

734
00:49:11,865 --> 00:49:13,992
THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY
OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA

735
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:16,244
I believe everyone is present.

736
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:18,163
Since everyone is present,

737
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:20,082
we will now commence the second meeting

738
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:23,710
of the Judiciary Committee
by the 356th National Assembly.

739
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:29,174
You said you were looking for factories
in Songju before 1999, correct?

740
00:49:29,257 --> 00:49:30,217
Yes.

741
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,010
The records of factories before 1999

742
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:34,012
should be around here.

743
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:36,807
Right here.

744
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:38,850
Here.

745
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:40,435
Thank you.

746
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:47,192
MINING AND MANUFACTURING

747
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:58,912
Make sure you don't miss anything
from the security footages.

748
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:00,330
-Got it.
-Got it.

749
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:05,419
I found him.

750
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:06,753
Where?

751
00:50:09,214 --> 00:50:10,465
Rewind it.

752
00:50:15,303 --> 00:50:17,472
-Where is this?
-Yeongil-myeon in Songju.

753
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:20,392
Form a team and get started.

754
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:22,269
-Yes, sir.
-Detective Lee, start the car.

755
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:24,438
-And request for backup.
-Yes, sir.

756
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:35,115
MINING AND MANUFACTURING

757
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:37,909
"Jeonggeon Steelwork"?

758
00:50:40,954 --> 00:50:42,205
This is Father's name.

759
00:50:54,092 --> 00:50:56,344
JEONGGEON STEELWORK

760
00:50:58,680 --> 00:50:59,723
IMAGES

761
00:51:09,357 --> 00:51:12,110
Now, we plan to pass the revised draft

762
00:51:12,194 --> 00:51:14,654
of the bill regarding clause 5.

763
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:15,739
Is there any objection?

764
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:18,742
-No.
-No.

765
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:20,202
I hereby declare

766
00:51:20,285 --> 00:51:22,746
clause 5 of the special bill

767
00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:25,791
on the new renewable energy business
complex in Songju has been passed.

768
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:35,926
Don't be a coward. Step on it.

769
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:37,219
Yes, sir.

770
00:51:39,387 --> 00:51:40,764
So you confirmed

771
00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:43,308
the water is contaminated
and hexavalent chromium is the cause,

772
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:45,519
but are you saying Songju RMC

773
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:47,103
didn't contaminate the water?

774
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:50,774
No, they didn't. I checked it
with the lab before coming here.

775
00:51:51,107 --> 00:51:54,402
The contamination began
at least 20 years ago.

776
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:56,905
In other words,

777
00:51:57,030 --> 00:52:00,492
the contamination started
even before they built Songju RMC.

778
00:52:00,575 --> 00:52:02,077
MINING AND MANUFACTURING

779
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:06,540
These are companies that handled
hexavalent chromium 20 years ago.

780
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:09,376
There is only one company I suspect.

781
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:12,212
"Jeonggeon Steelwork."

782
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:13,505
JEONG YEONG-MUN

783
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:15,298
"Jeong Yeong-mun"?

784
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:18,260
Yes. JQ used to be Jeonggeon.

785
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:22,389
JQ first started
as a steelwork company in Songju

786
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:24,182
where the lot for the new business is.

787
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:28,895
How far have we come?

788
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:30,730
We're almost there.

789
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:40,156
When I assumed that Songju RMC
was the source of the contamination,

790
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:44,244
I thought that this all happened
because of money.

791
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:46,580
Once people found out
about the contamination,

792
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:48,248
the business would fall through

793
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:51,960
and all the investment they made
in Songju would come to nothing.

794
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:55,505
And the price of the land they bought
in Songju would plummet.

795
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:58,466
If that happened, JQ would probably
end up with astronomical losses.

796
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:00,385
But what if it was the opposite?

797
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:05,015
JQ started to cover
the patients' medical bills

798
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:08,351
even before the National Assembly
began talking about the new business.

799
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,272
Even before they tried
to set up the new business,

800
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:16,234
JQ was aware of the patients
and their conditions?

801
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:17,527
Yes.

802
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:20,947
Then, JQ and Hong Min-guk aren't

803
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:24,618
trying to cover up the contamination
for the sake of the new business.

804
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:26,411
To cover up the contamination,

805
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:28,663
they came up with the new business

806
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:32,292
because they were the ones

807
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:34,127
who contaminated the land.

808
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:38,298
20 YEARS AGO

809
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:42,093
JEONGGEON STEELWORK

810
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:44,888
JEONGGEON STEELWORK

811
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:56,167
Poor baby.

812
00:55:14,602 --> 00:55:17,147
Then, the news article
Choe Su-hyeon was trying to write...

813
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:20,984
Then, can you tell me
when the illness started?

814
00:55:21,067 --> 00:55:22,485
It started about ten years ago.

815
00:55:23,236 --> 00:55:27,073
Right. Where do you get
your drinking water?

816
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:29,743
We get the water from the yard

817
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:31,327
-if I need it quickly.
-Yes, we do that.

818
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:35,206
By the way, how's your health?

819
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:38,668
When I went to the hospital,
I was diagnosed with renal cancer.

820
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:39,919
Renal cancer?

821
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:42,630
-I see.
-Yes. I still don't know what caused it.

822
00:55:46,342 --> 00:55:48,136
Mr. Kim Seung-cheol and Mr. Jeong Sang-hun

823
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:51,473
had no choice but to oppose
the new business in Songju...

824
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:53,558
SONGJU

825
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:56,227
This is a lot bigger than I thought.

826
00:55:57,103 --> 00:55:58,938
I didn't think it'd be this huge.

827
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:01,649
We must reveal this to the world.

828
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:05,111
It won't be easy.

829
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:08,198
Those people will do whatever it takes

830
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:10,533
to stop us.

831
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:13,953
Yes, they will.

832
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:20,710
It was because he found out
the real agenda of the new business.

833
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:23,630
Dad and Sang-hun...

834
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:26,925
They were trying to tell the public

835
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:31,137
that JQ contaminated the land

836
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:33,765
and that people were dying because of it.

837
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:41,272
2ND RESERVED LOT: HUI-DONG
1ST RESERVED LOT: BUHEUNG-MYEON

838
00:56:57,831 --> 00:56:59,040
JEON HO-GYU

839
00:57:57,932 --> 00:57:59,642
I know everything.

840
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:01,519
You contaminated the land, Father.

841
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:02,854
In case people find out,

842
00:58:02,937 --> 00:58:05,356
you're trying to set up
the new business complex there.

843
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:08,276
Yeong-min, you said
you would take care of Seo-hui.

844
00:58:08,359 --> 00:58:09,694
Forgive me.

845
00:58:11,779 --> 00:58:12,947
Let's cut him off.

846
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:19,787
Why are you here?

847
00:58:19,871 --> 00:58:21,206
Stop it now.

848
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:24,626
Do you have the result?

849
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:27,378
Something has gone wrong.

850
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:30,548
If not, why do we keep
having problem after problem?

851
00:58:31,132 --> 00:58:32,759
Let's handle the most urgent matter first.

852
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:34,928
Track her location or something!

853
00:58:35,553 --> 00:58:36,846
It doesn't matter what I say.

854
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:38,723
Isn't the answer already decided?

855
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:40,558
Who are you?

856
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:42,852
Over there!

857
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:47,649
You're finally getting things
done properly.

858
00:58:47,732 --> 00:58:48,858
Admit it.

859
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:51,819
I will never say what you want me to say.

860
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:52,862
Sang-hun.

861
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:55,240
Sang-hun is still alive.
