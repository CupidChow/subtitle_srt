1
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:42,250
THIS DRAMA IS A WORK OF FICTION.
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,

2
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:44,961
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGIONS, AND INCIDENTS
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:52,010
PREVIOUSLY

4
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:54,929
He was driving at 120km per hour
on a highway in the middle of the night.

5
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:57,724
He wasn't wearing his seat belt,
and he didn't even step on the brakes.

6
00:00:57,807 --> 00:00:59,350
He just drove into the traffic barrier.

7
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:03,396
MEMORIAL SERVICE

8
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:06,191
Sang-hun.

9
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:13,907
-Hello?
-Do you want to find him?

10
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,116
If you do as I say,

11
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,952
I'll tell you who did it and why
it happened. I'll tell you everything.

12
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:19,704
You're Kim Pil-yeon, right?

13
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:26,586
Track her location at once
and request for backup.

14
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:29,214
I said, enough.

15
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:34,219
Do you see all the scrapes and wounds?
They're a few days old.

16
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:35,970
This is confusing me.

17
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:39,766
Do you know the guy named Choi Chi-deuk?

18
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:42,352
He's the CEO of Songju RMC
that Kim Pil-yeon worked for.

19
00:01:44,103 --> 00:01:45,730
Kim Pil-yeon and Choi Chi-deuk?

20
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,399
Why does everything seem
to be circling around Kim Seo-hui?

21
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:54,405
Dae-yong, Choi Chi-deuk. We must check
if he's still at the hospital.

22
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:55,657
It's like a hit list.

23
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,284
Everyone under suspicion is dying.

24
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,912
Who's the bastard that's behind all this?

25
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:02,539
WANT TO SAVE YOUR HUSBAND?

26
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,126
JEONG SANG-HUN

27
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,961
No!

28
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:15,176
I have decided to run
in the upcoming by-election.

29
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,053
I have to do this. I must do it.

30
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,930
-Two, one.
-Two, one.

31
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:23,977
Kim Seo-hui of Liberal Democratic Party.
has received 51 percent of the vote.

32
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,728
It's been confirmed that she's elected.

33
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:26,855
THIS IS MY PRESENT FOR YOU

34
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,858
What an impeccable timing.

35
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:33,194
Someone came to the building
before the foot appeared.

36
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:34,904
What do you think?

37
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,157
Who do you think

38
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:39,492
put the foot there?

39
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:42,871
YOU MUST PROPOSE THE BILL
FOR THE NEW BUSINESS

40
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,040
Why won't you?

41
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,127
We'll pass the bill for the new business

42
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,920
-in two months.
-We're counting on you.

43
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,589
The lot for the new business.

44
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:55,258
That is the only common denominator
among the victims so far.

45
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,512
So the person
who took Jeong Sang-hun was...

46
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,055
It was the person who drove that car.

47
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:03,308
Tae-sik. Yes, it's In Dong-gu's car.

48
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:05,018
It's Yanggye-myeon, a town in Gangneung.

49
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:08,062
See if there's a place in the area
that has any connection to In Dong-gu.

50
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:12,025
His mother was hospitalized
at Yanggye Mental Hospital for many years.

51
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:14,903
I think I know what was happening
to Jeong Sang-hun and Kim Seung-cheol.

52
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:41,512
Your phone...

53
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:44,307
Can I please use your phone?

54
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:04,577
THE OTHER SIDE

55
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:34,250
IN DONG-GU

56
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,756
IN DONG-GU

57
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:51,684
IN DONG-GU

58
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,415
Jeez, that bastard. He got home hours ago.

59
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,417
How come he never turns on the lights?

60
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:20,922
Does he go to bed without even washing up?

61
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:35,645
So he just works and goes home?
That's all he does?

62
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:37,605
What a boring life he has.

63
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:39,440
Is he on probation or what?

64
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:43,611
He's practically glued
to Jeong Yeong-mun all the time.

65
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:48,241
I can try to summon him if I catch him
meeting up with Dr. Park, but he's...

66
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,744
He doesn't go anywhere near the hospital
and doesn't call him.

67
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,579
I couldn't get the search warrant.

68
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,291
-You couldn't get it issued?
-They wouldn't even budge.

69
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,670
Unless we can prove it's directly related
to Jeong Sang-hun's case.

70
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:03,214
The fact that they manipulated
the security footage proves it.

71
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:06,801
-Did you not tell them?
-I did, obviously.

72
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,137
I brought it up
as I was turning the doorknob.

73
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,556
They said we have to bring
the original footage.

74
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,725
Have those pricks
all gone nuts or something?

75
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:17,770
We need the warrant to get the footage.
They're making no sense.

76
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,899
Think about it. If they had
nothing to hide, why did they bother

77
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,860
manipulating the security footage?

78
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,486
They locked up Jeong Sang-hun there

79
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,406
and cut off his hand and foot.
That's why they manipulated the footage.

80
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,366
Well...

81
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,328
Hey, can't we just bring In Dong-gu in
and interrogate him?

82
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:37,623
Ask him where he took Jeong Sang-hun
and how he knows the hospital.

83
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,041
Do you think he will tell us?

84
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:42,920
If we make such a clumsy move,
he might show up with a lawyer

85
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,922
like Choi Chi-deuk did and walk out on us.

86
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:47,550
Why show him all our cards for nothing?

87
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:50,178
What if he feels threatened
and moves Jeong Sang-hun--

88
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:51,179
We have no choice.

89
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:55,183
We have to find that car In Dong-gu used
to pick up Jeong Sang-hun.

90
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:58,102
We'll find something inside that car
if we manage to track it down.

91
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,607
We should be able to arrest In Dong-gu
if we find evidence, right?

92
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,860
I don't even know.
I really wasn't expecting this.

93
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,743
What is it?

94
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,704
Why is it so hard for you to bring it up?

95
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:17,622
Mr. Kang.

96
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:19,874
When my dad was alive,

97
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,045
he consulted you
whenever anything happened.

98
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:26,881
Right, he did.

99
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:29,175
You see,

100
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,427
the bill for the new business...

101
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:35,556
My dad didn't want to propose it.
Did you know about it?

102
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:40,811
I read the letter he wrote
to the members of Songju RMC labor union.

103
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,147
He wrote he'd stop the new business

104
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,066
and that he'd protect Songju RMC.

105
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:52,698
A little while before he passed away,

106
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:56,661
he brought it up during a meeting
with the party leaders.

107
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:00,706
We'll put the new business bill on pause.

108
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,416
Pardon me?

109
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,753
The new renewable energy business
will be put on hold.

110
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:08,422
-What?
-But why...

111
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:09,757
We need to reconsider

112
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:12,218
the value of the project.

113
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:14,804
What about the general
and presidential elections next year?

114
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,723
If we do that, they'll support
the opposition party instead.

115
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,183
I made this decision for everyone,

116
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:23,813
so I'd appreciate it if you all
could understand my intentions.

117
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,022
That's all for today.

118
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:28,109
-My gosh.
-Can you really handle it?

119
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:32,780
I'm sure you know
what kinds of consequences await us.

120
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:34,615
Are you threatening me now?

121
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,325
I'm just worried whether you'll be

122
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:39,537
able to handle what lies ahead of you,
all by yourself.

123
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:42,832
If that is the right path,
I will gladly go alone.

124
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,127
-Sir!
-Wait.

125
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:49,255
-This is crazy.
-Gosh.

126
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:51,882
After that incident,

127
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,719
he gradually became ostracized.

128
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:57,054
No one sided with him.

129
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:00,433
Mr. Hong egged everyone on
to turn against your father.

130
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:02,727
Then how come you've kept this from me

131
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:04,687
all this time?

132
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,481
Because they're not
the kinds of people you can handle.

133
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:13,529
Hey, Ho-gyu.

134
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:17,992
You used to work at JQ. Is there
anything you know about In Dong-gu?

135
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:21,495
Jeez, do you know
how many employees JQ has?

136
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,789
Even the departments...

137
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:29,170
There are over 100 departments.
How would I know everyone in the company?

138
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:31,964
Captain, are you close to the chief
of the National Police Agency?

139
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:35,051
I'd like to be.
I'd be his servant if I could.

140
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,720
But he won't let me get close to him.

141
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,349
Jin-gyeong! It's getting dusty here
because of you.

142
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:44,101
Anyway, I don't really know anything
other than the rumors I heard.

143
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:47,063
Tae-sik, I'll help you.

144
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:51,108
Right.

145
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,778
I actually met him once.

146
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,617
Excuse me.

147
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,422
-Isn't he the strategic planning director?
-In Dong-gu, right?

148
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,507
He is.

149
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,467
Some people

150
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,719
just exude a strong charisma, you know?

151
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,972
He did look like a big shot.
I couldn't even talk to him.

152
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,016
-Like our supervisor?
-Whose supervisor?

153
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,771
-My gosh! Oh, no.
-Hey!

154
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:31,232
-Darn it.
-Goodness. Lift it.

155
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:32,608
Jeez.

156
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:36,112
Why did you say you'd help me?

157
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,614
-I'm sorry.
-And In Dong-gu

158
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:41,826
was known as a self-made man.

159
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,786
He didn't even go to college.

160
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,413
Do you think it's easy to become

161
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:48,207
the director of Strategic Planning
without a college degree?

162
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,376
-My apologies.
-Do you come to work to...

163
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:52,878
-Hello.
-And some may say Strategic Planning

164
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,547
is one of the key departments,

165
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,715
-Hello.
-but all they do is clean up messes.

166
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,384
-Let's drink.
-Cheers!

167
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,471
-Chairman Jeong is very pleased.
-Every company has a henchman,

168
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:06,559
who takes care of the dirty work
such as lobbying and managing contractors.

169
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:08,811
Stop it immediately!

170
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,354
-Stop it!
-Stop it!

171
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,189
When anything got
in Jeong Yeong-mun's way,

172
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:15,234
In Dong-gu completely got rid of it
like a bulldozer.

173
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,570
Like "cleaners" you see in movies.

174
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:25,327
Gosh, I'm hot. We got enough exercise.

175
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:26,954
I'm exhausted.

176
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:29,373
We only worked out for 20 minutes.

177
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:43,179
-Captain.
-Yes?

178
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,513
I'll wash up at the residence.

179
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:47,183
What? Did you shower with your clothes on?

180
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,602
-No, that thing turned on suddenly.
-Goodness.

181
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,563
Hey, finish what you were saying earlier.
Where were we?

182
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:56,525
I was going to say,
some people didn't like him.

183
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,111
People were like, "He'll actually

184
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,655
take his own life
if Jeong Yeong-mun tells him to die.

185
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:05,367
That's how an ex-bodyguard
managed to get that far." And so on.

186
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,660
But the thing is,

187
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:10,498
why would he do something like that
if he was that loyal to Chairman Jeong?

188
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:12,041
I don't get it.

189
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,877
You only stay loyal when there's something
you can get from that person.

190
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,462
You wouldn't do it for no reason.

191
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:19,381
Jeong Sang-hun suspected

192
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:22,426
that someone probably gave
Choi Chi-deuk the money to buy the land.

193
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:24,762
What if that's In Dong-gu?

194
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:26,639
Doesn't it make sense, then?

195
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,683
I mean, some people even kill
their families for money.

196
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:33,479
Then shouldn't he have bought
Choi Chi-deuk's land?

197
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:37,066
And you said Muyeon Industries
has nothing to do with In Dong-gu.

198
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,818
Right. The CEO of that company
is an ex-convict.

199
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:42,196
Fine, that's where that theory ends.

200
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,658
Then what about Dr. Park?

201
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:49,078
Anything else other than In Dong-gu's mom
was hospitalized there?

202
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,289
There were a few accidents
caused by medical malpractice.

203
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:55,084
But strangely enough,
they never got in trouble for them.

204
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:59,964
Tae-sik, what if In Dong-gu
took care of problems for the hospital

205
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:01,549
to keep Dr. Park under his thumb?

206
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:04,552
For example, "Cooperate and help me
abduct Jeong Sang-hun

207
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:07,137
unless you want the hospital
to be shut down."

208
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,139
Are you Jin-gyeong's avatar?

209
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,433
Well, I'm just...

210
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,435
You're learning useless things so quickly.

211
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:16,564
Well, what if Jeong Sang-hun
really is at the hospital?

212
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:18,983
We should do something.

213
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:20,901
Without a warrant?

214
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:23,112
Can't we just raid them?

215
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,490
Why do you have the 80s mindset
when you weren't even born back then?

216
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,326
Things like that can get us
in deep shit these days.

217
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:31,453
We need firm evidence.

218
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:33,914
What if we sneak in?

219
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:37,042
They won't tell us anything
even if we interrogate them.

220
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:40,838
We'll sneak in and find something
about Jeong Sang-hun.

221
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:44,884
You make it sound so easy.

222
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:47,595
Who's going to do it?

223
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:57,271
Jin-gyeong? Hey, we can't send her there.
She's not mentally sound.

224
00:14:57,354 --> 00:15:00,524
The patients' conditions will worsen.
We need to think about them too.

225
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,818
-I didn't think about that.
-I can't do it.

226
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,654
They all saw me
when Tae-sik and I went there earlier.

227
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,782
-You can't go even if they never saw you.
-Why don't you just shave your head

228
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:10,409
and check yourself into that hospital?

229
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,006
What?

230
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,970
-Shall I go and pick up some beer?
-Yes, sure.

231
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:39,146
All right. You're thinking
the same thing, right?

232
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,440
-That prick, right?
-Yes, he's perfect for the job.

233
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:45,069
-Let's see if you're ticklish!
-I shouldn't have left JQ.

234
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:48,197
Let's laugh together!

235
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:51,951
Let's clap!

236
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:56,914
Clap, clap, clap

237
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:00,876
Say hello, clap, clap, clap

238
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,087
The car you're looking for

239
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:06,048
was last caught on that camera
after passing through

240
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:09,843
Gangneung Expressway on March 6.
Then it disappeared.

241
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:13,263
So the footage shows the car
going in there

242
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:15,516
but not leaving this place.

243
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:16,600
That's right.

244
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:18,602
Then let's go and find it.

245
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:20,396
What?

246
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:25,025
Never mind. I'm sure you went
through hoops to find the footage.

247
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,444
Get going. I'll get off here.

248
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:50,217
Jeong Sang-hun, where are you?

249
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:54,138
Jeez, where do I start?

250
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:01,353
No, that's not him.

251
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:05,357
Gosh, where could he be?

252
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,696
I mean, he needs to eat, right?

253
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:16,160
Jeong Sang-hun, where are you?

254
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,164
This won't work.

255
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,334
I'm In Dong-gu.

256
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,880
I'm driving like this.

257
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,757
While driving like this,

258
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:31,884
I try to turn left here,

259
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:34,678
then make a right.

260
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:38,557
All right, let's try it one more time.

261
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,476
GAS STATION

262
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,186
-A little more.
-Sorry?

263
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:43,729
-This way.
-Which way?

264
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:45,898
-Toward you.
-Is this better?

265
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:48,776
A little more to the right.
That's too much.

266
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:51,653
Sir, may I check your security footage?

267
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:05,417
Sir, please calm down. Sir!

268
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:08,754
Move aside. Mr. Jeong Sang-hun!

269
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:11,965
Calm down!

270
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:15,594
Please calm down.

271
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:20,390
You can fast-forward this part.

272
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,605
Please play it again from here,
but don't speed up.

273
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:34,488
That's 3784.

274
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:37,241
It's In Dong-gu's car.

275
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:39,493
Gosh, I finally caught him.

276
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:46,625
What's that?

277
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,047
Where is his car? He walked out of there.

278
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,154
Sir, don't you remember this man?

279
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,655
He was here about a month ago.

280
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:20,492
I even forget my wife's face
from time to time these days.

281
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,911
How could I remember someone
whom I saw over a month ago?

282
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,706
Then what about this car?
Do you remember it at all?

283
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:27,749
It was brand new,
and it worked fine as well.

284
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,293
People rarely scrap a car like this.

285
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,003
I told you I don't remember.

286
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,631
Where's your ledger?

287
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,509
Where's it?
I'll take a quick look and leave.

288
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:38,719
Here it is.

289
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:43,599
What are you doing?

290
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,268
Let's see. March 6.

291
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,061
MARCH 5, 2019
MARCH 7, 2019

292
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:51,899
-It really isn't here.
-I told you I never saw such a car.

293
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:53,817
Why wouldn't you believe me?

294
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,110
But,

295
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,572
your handwriting looks so neat
as if you wrote all of this in one day.

296
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:00,824
I don't have time to write it all down
when I'm busy,

297
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:03,452
so there are times when I fill in
a few days' worth at once.

298
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:06,663
-What's wrong with that?
-Nothing. I understand it can happen.

299
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,291
Gosh.

300
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,251
I guess you can foresee the future.

301
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:15,380
-This goes all the way to 2020.
-Gosh.

302
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,927
I don't understand what happened.
Goodness.

303
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:24,348
Sir, I have to ask you this
because I'm really curious.

304
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,226
This man drove this car into an alley.

305
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:29,937
But he walked out of the alley later.

306
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:32,231
In that alley, there is nothing

307
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:34,483
but this junkyard.

308
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,777
Where do you think the car went?

309
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,154
I'm asking because I'm really curious.

310
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:41,365
Where on earth

311
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,159
could this car be?

312
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,328
Where is your business license?

313
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,413
And the card machine?

314
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,875
I suppose you've set up
a lucrative yet illegal business

315
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,794
that only accepts cash,

316
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:56,213
but I don't care about that.

317
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,382
If you tell me

318
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:01,134
exactly what you did with this car,

319
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,388
I'll turn a blind eye
to the aforementioned. Like this.

320
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:07,641
But if you don't tell me,
I'll search every nook and cranny

321
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:09,851
-with my eyes wide open.
-Well...

322
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:12,396
Shall I teach you a lesson?

323
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:16,650
Gosh, young lady.
Why are you so impatient?

324
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:19,486
Your memories are coming back, right?
This car.

325
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,997
DO YOU WANT TO SAVE YOUR HUSBAND?

326
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:33,375
BECOME AN ASSEMBLYWOMAN IF YOU WANT
TO SAVE JEONG SANG-HUN'S LIFE

327
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,169
So we'd like you to carry on the work
left unfinished by your father.

328
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,672
It will be something worthwhile.

329
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,389
WHAT IS IT THAT YOU WANT FROM ME?

330
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:48,515
PROPOSE A BILL

331
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:50,350
Don't waste your time and energy.

332
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,853
Just go and propose that bill tomorrow.

333
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:56,189
If you don't want to end up
like your dad, that is.

334
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:05,032
What's wrong, Assemblywoman Kim?

335
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:07,367
-Mr. Hong isn't here at the moment.
-Where is he?

336
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:10,287
He just left for the day.
If it's regarding an urgent matter...

337
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,797
Sir.

338
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:22,549
Sir.

339
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:46,698
Tae-sik, In Dong-gu scrapped that car.

340
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:49,159
-What?
-Gosh,

341
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:51,119
isn't it considered
destruction of evidence?

342
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:53,830
That bastard must've done something.

343
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:55,582
That son of a bitch.

344
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,469
Hey, I have to go.

345
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:13,266
That man...

346
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,909
What an odd combination.

347
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:35,580
My gosh, Mr. In.
I guess you're very busy these days.

348
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,459
I feel like I see the President
more often than you.

349
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:42,587
How's Kim Seo-hui doing?

350
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,589
She's doing pretty well.

351
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:47,634
I'm keeping a firm grip on her.

352
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,848
Who'd think
she's Kim Seung-cheol's daughter?

353
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,307
She's just like a pushover.

354
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:57,394
Still, you should stay vigilant.

355
00:23:58,145 --> 00:23:59,563
She's got his blood.

356
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:03,859
Mr. In, I'm quite experienced
in this field.

357
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:05,485
Don't you trust me?

358
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:07,779
We're working on a big plan together.

359
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:08,822
Here.

360
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:15,579
You can just let me
pour you a drink. All right.

361
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,292
So what happened to Mr. Choi?

362
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:23,211
I thought his physiognomy indicated
that he'd enjoy a long life.

363
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:27,924
I guess the land is
truly a dangerous thing.

364
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:31,761
Please watch what you are saying.

365
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:34,431
-What?
-In the recent election,

366
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:37,934
you got yourself into trouble
with a slip of the tongue.

367
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:43,899
If things go wrong
both you and I will be screwed.

368
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:45,066
You know that, right?

369
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:48,820
I know I can rely on your discretion,

370
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:50,906
but just in case you forgot.

371
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:57,412
It's disappointing
that you talk to me like that.

372
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:00,040
It's not like you're not getting anything.

373
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:02,334
What was it? Muyeon Industries?

374
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:04,502
Why did you not count it in?

375
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:09,132
Apparently Mr. Choi's land
passed into their possession.

376
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:12,302
You don't have to struggle
to make ends meet anymore.

377
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:15,055
You will soon get a lot of money.

378
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:28,485
Have a nice time, Assemblyman Hong.

379
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:39,329
What are you doing here?

380
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:42,415
How did you get in?
You're not supposed to be here.

381
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:45,252
-Please leave.
-Gosh, this isn't the room.

382
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:49,506
She has a poor sense of direction.
I guess she was lost.

383
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:50,924
Let's go.

384
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:51,967
I'm sorry.

385
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:55,136
Don't look that way.

386
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:59,975
It's like you're shooting
a James Bond movie alone.

387
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:02,310
What are you doing here?

388
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,855
It's not like you're here to eat alone.

389
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:11,695
-I was shadowing Assemblyman Hong.
-Hong Min-guk?

390
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:13,738
Why?

391
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:18,034
You just don't want to share
anything with me, do you?

392
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:21,830
What were you doing here then?

393
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,206
Me?

394
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:26,084
I was...

395
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:28,295
chasing In Dong-gu.

396
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:29,462
You know Mr. In, right?

397
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,965
Yes. Why?

398
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:34,134
It turns out

399
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:37,220
Jeong Sang-hun got in In Dong-gu's car
before he went missing.

400
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:39,472
What do you mean?

401
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:43,768
Did Mr. In take Sang-hun?

402
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:45,895
Why?

403
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:49,399
To where? Where is Sang-hun now?

404
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:50,317
Well...

405
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:52,402
We're not quite there yet.

406
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:57,157
So did you hear anything
in the room earlier?

407
00:26:58,408 --> 00:26:59,409
That's why...

408
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:03,204
They were talking about some land.

409
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,332
-Land?
-Yes.

410
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:07,250
Mr. Hong

411
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:10,170
was talking about a company.

412
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:13,298
It sounded like In Dong-gu
got Choi Chi-deuk's land.

413
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:15,008
-Okay.
-But,

414
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:17,177
In Dong-gu cut in.

415
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:20,305
Was the company
Muyeon Industries by any chance?

416
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:23,099
I think it was.

417
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:25,810
So it was his company.

418
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:27,604
Why? What about the company?

419
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,315
-Nothing.
-Detective Jo.

420
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:33,193
What does the company
have to do with Sang-hun?

421
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:34,486
I'll tell you later.

422
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:40,909
Nurse, my grandma seems strange.
Please come and check her.

423
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:41,868
Okay.

424
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,674
Here are the medical records.

425
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,385
Jeong Sang-hun.

426
00:27:58,468 --> 00:27:59,719
NO MATCHING INFORMATION

427
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:01,346
Darn, why isn't he there?

428
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,562
The year 2019.

429
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:12,190
March.

What are you doing here?

434
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:44,222
It's not like that.

435
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:46,558
I wasn't doing anything.

436
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:49,519
-How should I explain?
-You were playing a game, right?

437
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:51,312
What?

438
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:55,775
I heard it from your guardian.
Your parents put you in the hospital

439
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:57,736
because you're
a serious video game addict.

440
00:28:58,486 --> 00:28:59,988
And you're doing it again?

441
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:02,866
Move over.

442
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:06,077
You should get some sleep.

443
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,164
Hello, Mom.

444
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:10,915
It's me, Ho-gyu.

445
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:12,625
How are you doing?

446
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:16,921
Gosh, you sound so cheerful.
I guess you're doing just fine.

447
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:18,131
Hey, is it Ho-gyu?

448
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:19,632
Are you kidding me?

449
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:20,967
Just let me out.

450
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:25,680
I searched around
the whole hospital all day.

451
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:28,475
There's no trace
of Jeong Sang-hun here at all.

452
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:31,060
-Just let me out.
-Are you serious?

453
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:32,479
He's not there?

454
00:29:33,396 --> 00:29:34,814
That can't be right.

455
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,649
Is it right to put me in here?

456
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:38,943
That's not what I mean.

457
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:41,780
If Jeong Sang-hun isn't in the hospital,

458
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,741
why would the director switch
the security camera footage?

459
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:48,787
How can you be so sure
that he didn't change anything else?

460
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:50,830
I'll call you back.

PAY PHONE

462
00:29:58,254 --> 00:29:59,255
Hello?

463
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:02,550
What did he say?
Jeong Sang-hun isn't there?

464
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,677
I guess he didn't find anything.

465
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:08,264
We spent a fortune to put him in there.

466
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:10,975
What do we do?
Shall we raid the hospital now?

467
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:14,646
Kim Cheol-su. March 3rd.

PATIENT RECORD

469
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:18,316
Special treatment of the director?

470
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:24,072
Is Kim Cheol-su Jeong Sang-hun?

471
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:27,450
We should just go for it
and find Jeong Sang-hun there.

472
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:30,328
Then we can request an arrest warrant.

473
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:33,331
What if we fail to find him?
Will you take full responsibility?

474
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:37,001
We have you to take
responsibility for things like that.

475
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:41,798
Let's wait and see until tonight.

476
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,175
If it doesn't work, get them ready.

477
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:48,179
You've still got it.

478
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,265
Jin-gyeong, come here.

479
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:51,975
My gosh.

480
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:54,269
If you came close, I would hit you.

481
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,397
Ready to move out.

482
00:30:57,897 --> 00:30:59,107
Jeez.

483
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,650
She should be hospitalized instead.

484
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:02,861
Yes.

485
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:07,407
Okay. I'll tell him that.

486
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:12,829
Detective Jo,
Mr. Hong isn't in his office now.

487
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:14,289
He left early today.

488
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:15,790
That's ridiculous.

489
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:19,252
I just talked to the secretary
and checked his schedule.

490
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:21,129
I see.

491
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,256
But still, he's not in the office.

492
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:26,885
All right, then.

493
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:31,431
Assemblyman Hong Min-guk.

494
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,184
Gosh.

495
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:37,812
I was worried
I might have to wait for a long time.

496
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:40,231
Thank you for coming out so early.

497
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:42,400
Excuse me. He's busy now.

498
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:45,236
-Give me a moment.
-Yes, sir.

499
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:50,491
You know Jeong Sang-hun of JQ Group.

500
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:52,744
I'm busy looking for him now.

501
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,580
What does it have to do with me?

502
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:58,374
When someone dies or goes missing,

503
00:31:58,583 --> 00:31:59,876
I should find a person

504
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,045
who benefits most from it.

505
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:04,213
-What?
-I know Kim Seung-cheol

506
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:06,466
and Jeong Sang-hun
were against the new business.

507
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:08,927
After Assemblyman Kim died,

508
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,845
you became
the strongest presidential candidate.

509
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:14,390
And you pushed forward
the new business as planned.

510
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:17,644
It's not just you benefited from it.

511
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:19,270
I must say you hit the jackpot.

512
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:22,357
Was your name Detective Jo Tae-sik?

513
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:25,234
-Yes.
-Do you know who I am?

514
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:30,365
I don't think you did it yourself
getting blood on your hands.

515
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:32,742
Was it In Dong-gu?

516
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,410
The one who's being your hands.

517
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:36,704
I don't even know who he is.

518
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:39,082
That's absurd.

519
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:41,084
You even drank with him last night.

520
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:44,087
What did you say?
Have you been shadowing me?

521
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,049
You two had a talk over the drinks.

522
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,426
What was that about?

523
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:54,305
You said Muyeon Industries
is In Dong-gu's company.

524
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:59,060
That's interesting.
Why don't you share the story with me?

525
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:03,147
The CEO of the company
has nothing to do with him.

526
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,066
Why would you say it's In Dong-gu's?

527
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:08,403
Is that so?

528
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:11,197
Interesting.

529
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:15,034
Good luck with the investigation,
Detective Jo.

530
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:41,602
Now President Jeong Sang-hun
will give his inaugural speech.

531
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,312
Please give him a round of applause.

532
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:50,903
Right.

533
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:54,574
He didn't like Sang-hun to begin with.

534
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:58,327
I think it is Jeong Sang-hun's hand.

535
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:01,247
Mom.

536
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:02,290
Mom.

537
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:04,751
That can't be.

538
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:08,588
He didn't seem surprised back then.

539
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:12,967
It seemed like he knew it would happen.

540
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:15,428
No way.

541
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:18,139
Is it really Mr. In?

542
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:20,391
Mr. In...

543
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:36,949
Mr. Hong was talking about a company.

544
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:40,620
It sounded like In Dong-gu
got Choi Chi-deuk's land.

545
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:44,540
You said Muyeon Industries
is In Dong-gu's company.

546
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:46,667
That's interesting.

547
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:50,338
The CEO of the company
has nothing to do with him.

548
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,507
Why would you say it's In Dong-gu's?

549
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:55,259
It brought about the change
in his attitude.

550
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:58,054
Interesting.

551
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:01,933
Good luck with the investigation,
Detective Jo.

552
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,480
Does that mean
there's a connection between them?

553
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:08,523
SON DU-GANG, IN DONG-GU

554
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:13,402
That's right. He can't be the CEO
when he has nothing to do with In Dong-Gu.

555
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,030
If it's really In Dong-Gu's company.

556
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:17,573
They look alike.

557
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:20,284
My goodness.

558
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:23,287
No, I can't do this anymore.
I won't give you more drinks.

559
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:25,039
-You darn wench.
-My gosh.

560
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,750
I said my son will pay you.

561
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:29,418
Give me just one more drink, okay?

562
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:30,753
Okay, my ass.

563
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:33,714
You didn't even pay your tab.
Stop talking about your son

564
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,883
-and let me see him.
-Hello. Can I come in?

565
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,886
Sure. Please come on in.

566
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,805
I'm alone. Would you like to join me?

567
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:42,223
Okay.

568
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:43,808
-Let's go.
-Stop it. My gosh.

569
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,101
Well...

570
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:49,397
You remind me of my dad, so I'm paying.

571
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:51,524
But you need to stop drinking so much.

572
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:54,318
You look so sallow and weak.

573
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:55,695
You'll be in big trouble.

574
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:58,197
Go tell your dad

575
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:00,449
to quit drinking.

576
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:03,244
My dad passed away
because he didn't quit drinking.

577
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:05,496
Drink some water.

578
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,465
How old are you?

579
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:17,633
I'm 36.

580
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:19,677
You're 36?

581
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:21,679
Right.

582
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:23,890
My son

583
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,558
is your age.

584
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:27,059
Is he?

585
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:31,355
I guess, even if I die, my son

586
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:33,357
won't miss me.

587
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:35,234
That's impossible.

588
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:38,779
I'm serious. He will probably

589
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,198
feel glad.

590
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:44,202
I know you are a drunkard with no money,

591
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:46,454
but he can't be that hard on you.

592
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,206
I mean, In Dong-gu.

593
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:50,333
What?

594
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:52,335
Who are you?

595
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:54,545
Aren't I right? Your son is In Dong-gu.

596
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:57,006
Who are you? What do you want?

597
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:59,050
-Who on earth are you?
-My goodness.

598
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:00,009
Calm down. Just sit.

599
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:01,802
-You brat!
-Have a seat.

600
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:05,223
It's all right. Why are you so upset?

601
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,266
You must be surprised. I understand.

602
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,559
Let me pour you a drink.

603
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:13,105
Let's drink.

604
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:20,613
Gosh, this is nice.

605
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:26,494
It's not like I'm trying to pry
something out of you.

606
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,664
I'm just here to tell you something.

607
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:32,416
Speaking of which,

608
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:35,461
how has Mr. Choi
been getting along lately?

609
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,173
I mean, Mr. Choi Chi-deuk.

610
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:42,343
You don't know him?

611
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:45,846
Then,

612
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:48,599
you don't know Muyeon Industries either?

613
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:50,977
Gosh,

614
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:55,147
stop pretending not to know anything.
Muyeon Industries is your company.

615
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:56,065
Hey!

616
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:57,942
Keep your mouth shut.

617
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:01,779
Sir, it's not like that. The thing is

618
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:04,532
In Dong-gu put some money aside for you.

619
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:06,701
He also bought Mr. Choi's land
in your name.

620
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:09,620
What? Dong-gu did?

621
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:13,624
Yes. So I'm here
to recommend some investment.

622
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:16,294
Seriously, Dong-gu did that for me?

623
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,170
Sure.

624
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:12,058
YANGGYE MENTAL HOSPITAL

625
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:14,852
This isn't it.

626
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:16,187
No.

627
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:18,064
Where is it?

628
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:49,720
Gosh, my car key.

629
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:58,562
Patient register of 2019.

630
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:00,773
HER NIGHTLESS CITY
A FEMALE DOCTOR AND A MALE NURSE

631
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:03,901
Gosh, this is what a hospital director
watches at work.

632
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:06,028
PATIENT REGISTER OF 2019

633
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:07,405
PATIENT LIST OF 2019

634
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:09,573
Kim Cheol-su?

635
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:24,130
Jeong Sang-hun is really here.

636
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,633
The car key...

637
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:44,942
How clumsy of me.

638
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:48,821
I forgot my keys. There they are.

639
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,326
Did I

640
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:56,537
leave it there?

641
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:01,750
Where's my head at?

642
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:10,426
Goodness. Damn it.

643
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:21,520
Hello. What a surprise to hear
from you directly.

644
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:23,981
I see. Well,

645
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:26,525
I am very sorry.

646
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:29,361
Well, that was...

647
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:32,490
I am truly sorry.

648
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:38,245
I was sad

649
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:42,208
So I scream

650
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:44,210
And my heart

651
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:47,922
Okay. Try to stand up
on your own, will you?

652
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:51,926
You know what? Ever since he was a kid,

653
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:54,386
he was sort of caring, you know.

654
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:56,514
That's right.

655
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:58,390
I'll tell you what.

656
00:41:58,474 --> 00:42:00,476
When I went home very late,

657
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:03,521
he used to get a bucket of water

658
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:05,814
-and wait for me. I'm serious.
-Sure.

659
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:07,483
-That's right.
-Okay.

660
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:09,902
-He's a bad son for making you
-He's kind.

661
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:11,111
to live like this.

662
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:13,113
No. Hey, you.

663
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:16,867
-No, he's a nice son. He's very kind.
-My gosh. Come on.

664
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:19,078
My son, Dong-gu.

665
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:20,162
Jeez.

666
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:22,706
-It's all my fault
-Sir.

667
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,917
that he turned out that way.

668
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,253
Sir. Goodness.

669
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:30,172
I have brought this nightmare upon myself.

670
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:32,132
I have brought this nightmare upon myself.

671
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:36,470
Had I not caused the accident that day...

672
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:38,722
Accident?

673
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,934
Because of that accident...

674
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:45,104
What kind of accident, sir?

675
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:49,775
Sir.

676
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:52,069
Sir, sir.

677
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:53,612
Leave me alone.

678
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:56,490
Don't come in. Get lost!

679
00:42:56,991 --> 00:43:00,828
Don't tell anyone that you met me here.

680
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:03,914
Okay. I won't tell anyone.
Just take this with you.

681
00:43:19,054 --> 00:43:20,514
I'll leave it in front of your door.

682
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:25,811
COMMUNITY
PORK INTESTINE RESTAURANT

683
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:30,316
After his dad, Son Du-gang, drove drunk,
and the victim of the car accident died,

684
00:43:30,482 --> 00:43:32,985
his mom, In Yeong-mi,
was admitted to a mental institution.

685
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:35,779
Because of that, In Dong-gu
dropped out of high school.

686
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:38,073
Gosh, why are you being like this?

687
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:39,408
Dong-gu...

688
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:45,456
I bet he extremely resented his father

689
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:48,292
to the point that he took
his mother's last name.

690
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:54,465
And Chairman Jeong Yeong-mun who lent
a helping hand must've been his savior.

691
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:56,967
That's why he was loyal to the chairman.

692
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:59,136
"Muyeon Industries"?

693
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:01,388
"CEO Son Du-gang."

694
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:03,974
But he's been pocketing money
somewhere else?

695
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:07,269
It's all my fault

696
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:09,938
that he turned out that way.

697
00:44:10,522 --> 00:44:13,525
Had I not caused the accident that day...

698
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:19,281
"Accident."

699
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:22,910
Is that accident relevant to this case?

700
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:29,792
Why are you looking for that
ancient case report at this hour?

701
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:32,086
You know, how it is. That's our job.

702
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:35,464
I think we only have
the case report in written form.

703
00:44:35,547 --> 00:44:36,715
Well, let's go and check.

704
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:46,892
Goodness.

705
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:51,563
Oh, my. All right.
You need to look for it here.

706
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:55,734
Okay, thank you. I'll look around.

707
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:57,694
-Take your time.
-Okay.

708
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:02,658
My gosh. This is going to take forever.

709
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:10,666
Damn it. These aren't even organized.

710
00:45:35,732 --> 00:45:38,610
We'll raid the place first thing
tomorrow morning. Understood?

711
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:39,945
-Okay.
-Wait.

712
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:41,405
What about the warrant?

713
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:44,283
Well, get the warrant based on
the fabrication of the security footage.

714
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:46,702
Even if the warrant is denied,

715
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:49,246
we'll find something on the hospital
to see the medical record.

716
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:50,998
If they make an issue out of it,

717
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:53,083
we should use that
to save our asses. Okay?

718
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:54,501
-Okay.
-I got it.

719
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:56,295
And I want you guys to be on standby

720
00:45:56,378 --> 00:45:57,671
-at the hospital entrance.
-Okay.

721
00:45:57,754 --> 00:46:00,048
And as for detectives,
we'll split into pairs

722
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:02,301
-and raid each floor.
-Okay.

723
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:03,844
If you look at the map I gave out...

724
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:05,721
Are there photos
of the inside of the hospital?

725
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:07,347
There are about six floors.

726
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,269
Why isn't she answering her phone?

727
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:20,068
What's Jin-gyeong's phone number?

728
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:30,496
The hours of operation for the payphone
are up. Go back to your room.

729
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:32,956
No. Let me make one call.

730
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:35,167
Why aren't you sleeping at this hour?

731
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:38,629
Go to your room now.
Don't even think about playing games.

732
00:46:44,092 --> 00:46:45,427
Am I the only one working?

733
00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:48,972
I'm working my ass off here.

734
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:56,772
I know that you got a transfer there.

735
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:00,526
You go without me.

736
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:12,538
Where's Sang-hun?

737
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:15,123
What brings you here?

738
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:16,625
Where is Sang-hun?

739
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:26,927
Why are you asking me that?

740
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:30,806
You were the last person
who saw Sang-hun before he disappeared.

741
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:34,601
Where did you take him to?

742
00:47:36,853 --> 00:47:37,729
So,

743
00:47:38,438 --> 00:47:39,940
are you suspecting me?

744
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:43,068
Why?

745
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:44,903
Why would I

746
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,656
do such a thing to him?

747
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:52,619
I know that my father and Sang-hun
were against the new business.

748
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:56,373
Didn't you and Mr. Hong have to stop them

749
00:47:57,332 --> 00:47:59,543
from going against it
by any means necessary?

750
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:03,880
I know Choi Chi-deuk's land
belongs to you now.

751
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:06,758
It's just some land.

752
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:10,596
Did you harm people for mere money?

753
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,686
"Mere money."

754
00:48:18,186 --> 00:48:19,813
IN DONG-GU

755
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:24,067
I guess people like Mr. Jeong and you

756
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:27,112
can say something like that
as if it's nothing.

757
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:29,448
What?

758
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:31,867
Is it because you've never had
to struggle for a living

759
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:33,702
thanks to your rich parents?

760
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:36,538
If you eavesdrop on other people

761
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:39,082
and interrogate people,

762
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:41,627
do you think that'll bring him back?

763
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:45,839
I think there has been
a huge understanding.

764
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:49,426
I am doing my best to find Mr. Jeong, too.

765
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:51,470
So if you truly wish

766
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:54,514
that your husband comes back alive,

767
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:58,101
just do what you're supposed to do.

768
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:02,481
What am I supposed to do?

769
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:15,369
Seo-hui.

770
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:31,093
It happened in 1994.

771
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:32,010
DRIVER: SON DU-GANG

772
00:49:33,178 --> 00:49:34,638
"Son Du-gang."

773
00:49:39,726 --> 00:49:42,896
All right. "Traffic Collision
Against Guardrail on Yongin Expressway.

774
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:46,608
Driver, Son Du-gang.
And two passengers in the car died.

775
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:51,446
Son Du-gang had minor injuries.

776
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:53,615
Seo Eun-suk died on the scene."

777
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:56,535
"Seo Eun-suk"?

778
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:04,626
JEONG SANG-HUN

779
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:05,669
MOTHER: SEO EUN-SUK

780
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:08,880
If Seo Eun-suk on this file
was his late mother,

781
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:15,887
Jeong Yeong-mun's wife died
because of In Dong-gu's father.

782
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:52,048
Hello, Mom.

783
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:54,301
-It's me.
-Ho-gyu.

784
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:55,635
Go ahead.

785
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:57,471
I found something.

786
00:50:57,679 --> 00:50:58,597
Did you find him?

787
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,974
Hey, what did he say?
Did he find evidence?

788
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:04,895
I know what the hospital is
trying to hide.

789
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:06,188
What is that?

790
00:51:07,856 --> 00:51:09,357
Hey, what is he talking about?

791
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:12,611
-What?
-What? What is it?

792
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:18,200
-Captain, we have a problem.
-What?

793
00:51:18,283 --> 00:51:19,868
This case just got out of hand.

794
00:51:19,951 --> 00:51:21,036
-Dae-yong.
-What do you--

795
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:24,372
-Hold on. Wait.
-Captain.

796
00:51:25,081 --> 00:51:26,708
You need to listen to this first.

797
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:28,084
This is unbelievable.

798
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:29,711
-This is crazy.
-You should come in, too.

799
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:31,213
-Seriously.
-Go inside.

800
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:33,006
Tae-sik.

801
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:37,302
What brings you here?

802
00:51:40,013 --> 00:51:41,389
Why did you meet with Mr. In?

803
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:43,517
Yeong-min.

804
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:49,272
This is a hypothetical question.

805
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:53,902
Let's say that you have to do
something to save Sang-hun.

806
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:58,615
And what you have to do
might not be the right thing to do.

807
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:01,243
But if you must do it for him,

808
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:03,453
what would you do?

809
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:09,292
But you don't know for sure
if it will bring back Sang-hun.

810
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:10,961
-Would you still--
-Seo-hui, I must do it.

811
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:15,382
Whatever that may be,

812
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:18,009
if I can save Sang-hun, I must do it.

813
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:23,849
I wish I could have

814
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:27,102
a chance to make a decision like you.

815
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:37,112
You know why you're here, right?

816
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:44,744
Mr. In.

817
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:46,746
Why?

818
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:48,957
Why did you do it?

819
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:52,502
Mr. Jeong was emotionally unstable.

820
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:55,505
When he was young,

821
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,591
he had been treated
for an anxiety disorder.

822
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:01,511
I thought that he had gotten better,

823
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:04,890
but his condition worsened
after taking on the new business.

824
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:08,018
He couldn't cope under pressure, so--

825
00:53:08,101 --> 00:53:10,145
So you put him in a mental institution?

826
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:12,522
Driving a car,
registered under a fake name?

827
00:53:13,106 --> 00:53:15,066
Goodness, that's quite scary.

828
00:53:16,776 --> 00:53:19,821
Jeong Sang-hun went missing on March 6th.

829
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:23,325
You canceled a scheduled meeting
and disappeared for about two hours.

830
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:25,160
What did you do?

831
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,003
All right. Let's try again.

832
00:53:35,086 --> 00:53:37,672
Why were you
on Gangneung Expressway at that time?

833
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:44,846
You went to the hospital
to hide Jeong Sang-hun.

834
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:47,641
I went there because I received a call
that he had gone missing.

835
00:53:48,516 --> 00:53:51,603
You drove a fake vehicle again that day
and scrapped the car that night.

836
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:53,855
Did you scrap it
in case we found his traces there?

837
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:56,232
I was only trying to cover up
his traces at the hospital.

838
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:57,484
You're going to keep lying?

839
00:53:58,693 --> 00:54:01,571
Do you think you can weasel
your way out of here with that excuse?

840
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:04,866
What will you do?

841
00:54:08,244 --> 00:54:09,871
You've been following me for some time.

842
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:11,998
So you should know better than anyone.

843
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:15,126
Do you have direct proof

844
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:18,046
that I kidnapped Mr. Jeong
and cut off his limbs?

845
00:54:20,256 --> 00:54:21,341
What?

846
00:54:22,133 --> 00:54:24,386
You've been barking up
the wrong tree the whole time.

847
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:27,681
And I get that you're excited to have
something that looks like a lead.

848
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:29,224
But you should know when to stop.

849
00:54:30,308 --> 00:54:33,436
-You bastard.
-How much longer will you waste your time

850
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:35,522
like an idiot?

851
00:54:42,862 --> 00:54:44,406
What did you say?

852
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:56,167
Jeez.

853
00:54:57,293 --> 00:55:00,130
Oh, no. What made you fall off the tree?

854
00:55:03,758 --> 00:55:05,093
Poor thing.

855
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:07,012
You know what? I can't let this be.

856
00:55:08,763 --> 00:55:10,807
I'll bring you to your mother.

857
00:55:12,892 --> 00:55:15,854
Let me see. This bird fell off the tree.

858
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:25,363
Goodness, look at you. You had no idea
that your baby fell off your nest.

859
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:27,532
Stay still. There you go.

860
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:45,050
You don't look so good, sir.

861
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:49,471
We ought to find your son
as soon as possible.

862
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:50,972
We're very sorry.

863
00:55:52,557 --> 00:55:53,558
Thank you.

864
00:55:54,934 --> 00:55:55,935
Tell me.

865
00:55:57,687 --> 00:56:00,065
What is the investigation going?

866
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:01,649
Well,

867
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:04,110
we haven't made any progress yet.

868
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:10,158
I'm only telling you this
not to give you any false hope.

869
00:56:10,992 --> 00:56:14,079
For cases like this,
there's something called the golden time.

870
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:18,083
If we can't find the missing person
within 48 hours,

871
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:20,168
it's likely it will remain unsolved
for a long time.

872
00:56:20,835 --> 00:56:21,878
As you know,

873
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:24,130
a lot of time has already passed.

874
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:25,381
So what?

875
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,343
You're calling it quits?

876
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:31,638
Are you here to tell me
that since the police have given up,

877
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:34,390
I should give up on my son, too?

878
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:35,600
If so,

879
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:38,645
will you be able to give up?

880
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:42,690
We haven't given up yet.

881
00:56:43,024 --> 00:56:44,734
We should do as much as we can.

882
00:56:45,777 --> 00:56:46,611
I was just

883
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:48,530
disappointed.

884
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:50,740
As I continued to investigate the case,

885
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:54,244
I thought that we could have been able
to find your son sooner.

886
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:57,997
That just crossed my mind.

887
00:56:59,415 --> 00:57:00,416
What do you--

888
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:03,294
My colleagues and I gave this case our all

889
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:04,796
and barely managed to come thus far.

890
00:57:04,879 --> 00:57:06,214
But only to find out

891
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:08,883
that this was all where it began.

892
00:57:10,051 --> 00:57:13,138
Sir, why didn't you tell me
in the first place

893
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:16,808
that he was admitted
in Yanggye Mental Hospital

894
00:57:16,891 --> 00:57:18,560
on the day of his disappearance?

895
00:57:19,394 --> 00:57:22,439
And that you were the one
who put your son in there.

896
00:57:26,192 --> 00:57:29,237
Hello. What a surprise to hear
from you directly.

897
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:31,739
I am very sorry.

898
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:36,953
Well, we searched the entire hospital
in order to find him,

899
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:38,872
but strangely, we couldn't--

900
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:41,082
I'm sorry.

901
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:43,460
The police didn't get anything from us.

902
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:47,338
We have erased all the traces

903
00:57:47,922 --> 00:57:50,133
of Mr. Jeong at the hospital.

904
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:53,928
In fact, I have already
informed Mr. In about it.

905
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:55,889
Even if something goes wrong,

906
00:57:56,764 --> 00:57:59,642
I will make sure that you won't be
affected by this, Chairman Jeong.

907
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:02,479
Please trust me, sir.

908
00:58:04,355 --> 00:58:05,440
Is it because

909
00:58:06,107 --> 00:58:07,150
the new business?

910
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:13,072
Kim Seung-cheol, Jeong Sang-hun,
Kim Pil-yeon, Choi Chi-deuk, In Dong-gu,

911
00:58:13,364 --> 00:58:14,782
and you included.

912
00:58:16,117 --> 00:58:19,787
The only connection that ties in everyone
is the new business.

913
00:58:21,414 --> 00:58:24,375
Assemblyman Kim and your son were
against the business, weren't they?

914
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:28,379
Well, I think Kim Pil-yeon
got caught in the crossfire.

915
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:33,009
And Choi Chi-deuk and In Dong-gu were
probably in favor of the new business.

916
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:37,138
Then, which side were you on?

917
00:58:39,557 --> 00:58:41,309
Of course, you would be in favor of it.

918
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:44,687
That's why you locked your son up
in a mental hospital.

919
00:58:45,813 --> 00:58:47,023
What are you accusing me of?

920
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:49,150
What kind of father

921
00:58:49,817 --> 00:58:53,029
would throw away his only son
just to set up a new business?

922
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:55,532
Your only son?

923
00:58:57,742 --> 00:58:58,576
Right.

924
00:58:58,952 --> 00:59:00,411
Well, you do have a point.

925
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:03,748
Then, how will the story change
in this case?

926
00:59:06,334 --> 00:59:09,504
What if Jeong Sang-hun,
isn't your only son?

927
00:59:10,755 --> 00:59:11,923
That is...

928
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:14,175
He is your son.

929
00:59:15,176 --> 00:59:16,135
JEONG SANG-HUN

930
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:18,179
But what if he's not your birth son?

931
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:21,099
JEONG SANG-HUN
BRAIN DEAD WHILE PERFORMING CPR

932
00:59:21,766 --> 00:59:23,309
Will that give you a good enough reason?

933
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:28,106
The man we're looking for,
Jeong Sang-hun...

934
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:34,779
Who is he, really?

935
01:00:05,977 --> 01:00:07,395
Are you telling me Jeong Sang-hun

936
01:00:07,478 --> 01:00:08,688
disappeared from the hospital?

937
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:11,482
Do you think there isn't any problem?

938
01:00:11,566 --> 01:00:13,610
Tell him that he has to keep
his promise now.

939
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:17,572
The day after Jeong Sang-hun went missing,
a part-timer quit.

940
01:00:17,655 --> 01:00:20,033
Father, did you really know all along?

941
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:23,494
I should have stopped him.
I let him trick me.

942
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:26,039
Have you seen this man before?

943
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:29,167
The entire plan is ruined because of him.

944
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:31,002
I'm going to save you first

945
01:00:31,085 --> 01:00:33,671
even if there's only a slim chance.

946
01:00:34,839 --> 01:00:36,841
