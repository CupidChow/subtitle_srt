1
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,250
THIS DRAMA IS A WORK OF FICTION.
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,

2
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:44,961
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGIONS, AND INCIDENTS
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,299
I couldn't turn a blind eye to it
any longer. I'll help you.

4
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:53,470
PREVIOUSLY

5
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,180
We must reveal this to the world.

6
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:58,767
Those people will do whatever it takes
to stop us.

7
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:09,027
We believe that Jeong Sang-hun
was kidnapped through the vent

8
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,613
and he ran away to the hill
behind the hospital after getting out.

9
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:14,157
Jeong Sang-hun went missing on March 6.

10
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:16,326
You canceled a scheduled meeting

11
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,203
and disappeared for about two hours.

12
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:19,162
What did you do?

13
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:21,372
Do you have direct proof

14
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,541
that I kidnapped Mr. Jeong
and cut off his limbs?

15
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:26,628
-You bastard.
-How much longer will you waste your time

16
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,129
like an idiot?

17
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,131
We'll start the search from this point

18
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:32,425
while keeping the distance
to the left and right.

19
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:34,969
Isn't that a tire mark?

20
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:37,347
RESULTS ON TIRE MARK

21
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:41,726
This is from my car.

22
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,812
Yeong-min is a suspect?

23
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:47,774
Yes. He was the last person
Mr. Jeong spoke to on the phone

24
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:49,234
before he disappeared.

25
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:52,153
He was also the one
who went to the woods to pick him up.

26
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,657
Where is Jeong Sang-hun?

27
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,867
-I don't know.
-That's a lie.

28
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:01,788
That's enough.

29
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:06,918
Wait. Please ask him this question.

30
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:09,379
Jin Yeong-min.

31
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:11,798
Do you actually

32
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:15,844
want Sang-hun to come back alive?

33
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:19,973
-Ms. Kim.
-Ms. Kim!

34
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:24,269
So you have been receiving these messages
from the culprit all this time?

35
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:25,270
That's why I'm here.

36
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:27,272
I wanted to ask someone for help,

37
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:29,732
and you were the only person
I could think of.

38
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,651
February 14th...

39
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:33,653
The horrible things.

40
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:35,864
How long did you think
you could hide them?

41
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:39,117
Did you actually think
you could hide them to the end?

42
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:43,496
She's a reporter for Bareun News.

43
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:47,917
The number 0214 means the date she died.

44
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:50,044
I know.

45
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:52,005
I investigated the case.

46
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:55,758
DEATH LEAP DUE TO DEPRESSION
LIEUTENANT JO TAE-SIK

47
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,428
Please reinvestigate the case
from scratch.

48
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:11,065
Please find my daughter.
Please find Ga-yeon for me.

49
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:13,318
Where is my daughter?

50
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:16,738
I'm begging you.

51
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:18,990
-Where's Ga-yeon?
-Please find her.

52
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:21,743
Please find my sister.

53
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:23,703
It's all my fault.

54
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:25,663
I'm so sorry.

55
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,832
-This is my fault.
-Please find her for me.

56
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,835
Please find my sister.

57
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:34,422
Find my sister, please.

58
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,215
-Find her, please.
-Please find her.

59
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,259
Please find my daughter.

60
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:41,512
-Please. It's all my fault.
-Please.

61
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,308
Please. I'm begging.

62
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:48,645
Please find my sister.

63
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:52,232
-Please. Please find her.
-I'm begging you.

64
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:03,826
Is it her?

65
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:07,830
It's not your sister.

66
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,337
Are you all right?

67
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:17,006
Whenever you said that it wasn't her,

68
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,760
I was relieved.

69
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:26,015
"She must be alive somewhere.
That's why I can't find her body."

70
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:28,685
I used to think that.

71
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:32,397
But now,

72
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,655
I'd rather

73
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:44,993
find something even if it's her body.

74
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,248
So I'll at least know
if she's dead or alive.

75
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:00,591
Hey, Tae-sik.

76
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:03,428
Yes. What is it? Are you already done?

77
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:05,555
No, it's not that. Well...

78
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,432
Tae-sik,

79
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:12,103
we recently apprehended a child kidnapper.

80
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:15,565
Well,

81
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,192
he confessed to his previous crimes, too.

82
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:20,737
Twenty-five years ago,

83
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:24,824
he also kidnapped a girl in your hometown
and buried her.

84
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:28,828
But it can't be your sister, right?

85
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,205
It can't be.

86
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:34,667
Hey.

87
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,919
Hey, go with him.

88
00:05:55,688 --> 00:06:00,193
KOREAN CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION

89
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:38,231
REPORT OF TRANSFER

90
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:39,774
JO TAE-SIK, POLICE AGENCY

91
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:52,912
NAME: JO TAE-SIK

92
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:57,875
No, my baby...

93
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,211
Su-hyeon!

94
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:05,925
My daughter, Su-hyeon. My gosh.

95
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:07,760
Su-hyeon! Please...

96
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:12,682
Su-hyeon.

97
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,690
It does seem like she died from the fall,

98
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,859
but a drug was detected in her blood.

99
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,152
An antidepressant?

100
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:26,529
No. Gamma-hydroxybutyrate.

101
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:31,409
-GHB.
-GHB? The psychoactive drug?

102
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:33,578
And the fact that the drug
still remains in the blood

103
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:35,955
means that she died
within 20 minutes of ingesting it.

104
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:40,293
Did you say she jumped off
from the roof of a building?

105
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,086
Yes.

106
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,671
Judging from the amount of GHB,

107
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:46,174
she must've lost her consciousness
as soon as she ingested it.

108
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:48,384
She wouldn't even have been able
to move her fingers.

109
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:51,387
-It was a homicide, right?
-One thing I can say

110
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:53,806
is that she must've
had no idea what was happening.

111
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:57,101
Whether she was taking her own life,

112
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,978
or if she was being forced into it.

113
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,358
Dae-yong.

114
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:07,028
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

115
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,579
You must think I'm a joke.

116
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:18,915
Take me seriously.

117
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:22,668
I told you not to do it. Didn't I?

118
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,046
I even begged you not to do it.

119
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,715
I'm sorry I did this behind your back.

120
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:29,967
I'm sorry about that.

121
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,345
-But Dae-yong, this is--
-Hey!

122
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,974
Hey, I'm not trying to
save my own ass here.

123
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,895
I told you there was a good reason for it.
I told you that!

124
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,021
What do you mean?

125
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,066
The higher-ups

126
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:48,069
told me not to investigate this case.

127
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:52,156
You can just go around
and dig things up as you please.

128
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:55,660
-Then, how will that make me look?
-This is a homicide.

129
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,745
Choe Su-hyeon was murdered.

130
00:08:58,412 --> 00:08:59,789
Should we still bury this case?

131
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,208
And it's connected
to Jeong Sang-hun's case.

132
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:05,545
You wanted to find him. You said
we needed to find his body at least.

133
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,005
I don't even need to go that far.

134
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:11,509
The victim of the case we took on
was murdered.

135
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:12,927
She didn't take her own life.

136
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:15,054
You want to turn a blind eye to that?

137
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:16,973
Is that it?

138
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,810
I can't do that. I can't do it
for the sake of my dignity.

139
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:29,527
I know that you're in a tight spot.
I thought about your situation. But...

140
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:31,445
But if we don't reinvestigate,

141
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:34,490
this is just wrong.

142
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:37,743
Tae-sik.

143
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:41,330
Go back to your hometown.

144
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,251
For me to live

145
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:48,129
and not to turn my back on you,

146
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:50,673
this is the best way.

147
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,218
Go back to your hometown quietly.

148
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,600
I withdrew it.

149
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,108
I withdrew my request of transfer.

150
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,111
I can't leave like this.

151
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:30,921
COMMISSIONER-GENERAL PARK DO-SIK

152
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:36,218
You're here.

153
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,223
Hello. My apologies
for not introducing myself earlier.

154
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:43,100
Congratulations on your appointment.

155
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:44,935
-Take a seat.
-Okay.

156
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,529
So you're Captain Yu Dae-yong?

157
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:56,864
Yes.

158
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:59,075
I was debriefed
about the Jeong Sang-hun case.

159
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:00,868
You must be busy these days.

160
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,787
No, it's all right.

161
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,665
You must be busy,
investigating Bareun News.

162
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,627
That's giving me a headache, you know.

163
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:12,505
I'm sure you must have heard.

164
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,925
The former commissioner-general
resigned because of that case.

165
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:18,177
I'm sorry.

166
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:23,057
You know, the flame spurts
from the bottom to the top.

167
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:25,976
When a junior-ranking officer
is too enthusiastic,

168
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:30,856
that enthusiasm ends up jeopardizing
the senior-ranking officer for no reason.

169
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:35,069
Is that what you want for yourself?

170
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,446
Well,

171
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:40,408
we already have the autopsy result.
If we cover it up--

172
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:43,244
I think you're mistaken.

173
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:45,663
Do you think

174
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,417
this warning is coming from me?

175
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:04,765
Excuse me.

176
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:07,852
Where should I go to make
an inquiry about an article?

177
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:09,562
One moment, please. Let me check.

178
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:11,063
Ms. Kim Seo-hui?

179
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:13,607
We haven't met.

180
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:16,652
-Sorry, who are you?
-Please join me in my office.

181
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,828
You must be busy. What brings you here?

182
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,455
BAREUN NEWS, NAM SU-MI

183
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:28,789
Please have a seat.

184
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,545
I can meet you
where it's convenient for you next time.

185
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:35,963
A lot of people do that.

186
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:41,510
So what brings you
all the way to my office?

187
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,721
It's about the reporter, Choe Su-hyeon.

188
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,391
I can't explain it in detail.

189
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:52,938
But I think her case and my husband's case
are connected in some way.

190
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,775
I tried to find articles she wrote,

191
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:00,279
but I couldn't find any articles online.
All of them were deleted.

192
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,616
Please tell me why.

193
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:09,955
That girl, Choe Su-hyeon,
is causing trouble even in her grave.

194
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:13,459
I heard they performed an autopsy on her.

195
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:16,337
I'm sorry.

196
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,796
What about Yeong-min?

197
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,091
Do you have him under control?

198
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:23,302
Yes.

199
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:25,679
I don't know

200
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,307
how much I should trust him.

201
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:31,560
As he's connected to Ms. Choe's death,

202
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,938
it will be hard for him
to switch sides now.

203
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:36,357
Nonetheless, I'll keep an eye on him.

204
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,150
The problem is

205
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,737
that detective, Jo Tae-sik.

206
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:44,365
Because of that bastard,

207
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:47,326
even Seo-hui is trying to get
information about Choe Su-hyeon.

208
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:49,870
At this rate,

209
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:53,082
there will be a serious problem
if the article

210
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,750
she tried to write gets disclosed.

211
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:57,878
We must stop that at all costs.

212
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:02,925
I had a word with the newly appointed
commissioner-general about this,

213
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:05,553
but I don't feel good about it.

214
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:10,516
My warning doesn't seem
to scare that bastard, Jo Tae-sik.

215
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,685
Make him stop even if

216
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,312
you have to cut off his limbs.

217
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,607
Yes, sir.

218
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:23,237
Choe Su-hyeon was born on April 23, 1986

219
00:14:23,862 --> 00:14:25,155
in Seoul.

220
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:28,742
She would be 33 years old this year.

221
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:32,246
After graduating from Ganghyeon University
as a sociology major,

222
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:33,873
she got a job at Bareun News.

223
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:36,917
After working at the editorial
and social news departments,

224
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,169
she moved to the entertainment department
this January.

225
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,463
Right after the assignment...

226
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,465
Do you have to listen to this in the car?

227
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,635
I think I'm going to get carsick.

228
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,972
You already know all of this.
This was your case.

229
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,767
Look at the weather.

230
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,811
It's a great day to beat up my junior.

231
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,272
It's just that I don't understand this.

232
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:02,276
Isn't trying to figure out
who killed Choe Su-hyeon our main focus?

233
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:04,862
If it is, we shouldn't check
her personal profile.

234
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:07,406
We must figure out who came
to her on the day she died

235
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:10,784
and drank the juice together.
That person probably drugged her, too.

236
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,578
Then, we might be able to find out

237
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:15,623
if that bastard is connected to
Kim Seung-cheol or Jeong Sang-hun's case.

238
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:18,292
Or at least, it means that that bastard
is connected to the culprit.

239
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:21,921
You asshole. Do you really think
Tae-sik doesn't know that?

240
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:25,090
The case happened months ago,
so there's no security footage.

241
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:28,135
Forget about the cup.
All the evidence is gone.

242
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:29,803
And there was no eyewitness.

243
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:31,597
How will you investigate?

244
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,391
How are you going to catch the culprit?

245
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,562
That's why we should start
with Choe Su-hyeon's personal profile.

246
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:41,148
Let's find out what she was up to,
why she had to die,

247
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:43,484
how she was connected to Jeong Sang-hun,

248
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:46,195
and who would visit her at her apartment.

249
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:47,780
Let's find out first.

250
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:49,949
Did you get that?

251
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:52,952
Stop acting like you know everything,
and finish reading it.

252
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,828
TRANSFERRED
TO THE ENTERTAINMENT DEPARTMENT

253
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,374
Right after the transfer,
she took a leave of absence.

254
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:01,752
It's suspected that she had been in Songju
right before she died.

255
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:02,962
Songju?

256
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,172
Why Songju?

257
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,216
We should find out.

258
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:10,970
Out of all places, she was in Songju
right before she died.

259
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:15,015
Choe Su-hyeon was
working on a story about JQ?

260
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,645
It's embarrassing to say this,
but a newspaper agency is a business, too.

261
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,981
It's hard to run the company
without the ads

262
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:23,941
and sponsorships from conglomerates.

263
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,319
When I heard that
Ms. Choe was digging stories about JQ,

264
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,029
I had no choice.

265
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:31,949
I sent her to the entertainment department
to take a break,

266
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:33,701
she submitted a leave of absence.

267
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:37,496
Even so, how could you delete
all of her published articles?

268
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:41,792
As you know, your husband's eye
was delivered to our agency.

269
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:43,585
Everyone including our competitors

270
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:47,047
are trying to figure out
what his connection was to our agency.

271
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:49,383
I thought it would be safer
to leave no loose ends.

272
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,386
I did what I did to protect the agency.

273
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:55,305
What did Ms. Choe write about JQ?

274
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:56,557
I don't know

275
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:58,934
the content of her article.

276
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,103
You did that
without even knowing the content?

277
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:05,649
Shouldn't the news desk
review all the articles beforehand?

278
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,110
One thing I know for sure

279
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:11,113
is that JQ didn't want
her article to be published

280
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:15,117
and that they didn't want anyone
to read Ms. Choe's article on JQ.

281
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,911
-Who was it?
-Pardon?

282
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:20,956
The person who made that request from JQ.
Who was it?

283
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,836
JIN YEONG-MIN

284
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:29,131
Sir, please take a look.

285
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,301
Please check the order
of your inaugural ceremony.

286
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:34,887
Let me brief you on your schedule.

287
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:38,599
Go to the headquarters in Seoul by 2 p.m.
The rehearsal will last for 30 minutes.

288
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,060
The ceremony will begin at 3 p.m.,
and end at 4 p.m.

289
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:42,519
And after the ceremony,

290
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:45,230
you have a dinner appointment
with the chairman and other executives.

291
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,900
-Will that be okay?
-No, I have another appointment.

292
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:52,196
But the chairman set up the appointment.

293
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,156
I'm sure he'll understand.

294
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,657
Okay.

295
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,832
It's about Choe Su-hyeon.

296
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,418
Where in Songju
do you think she stayed for a month?

297
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:09,630
Given her movement,
I'm certain she did stay in Songju.

298
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,883
-She didn't pay for accommodations.
-Does she have a friend in Songju?

299
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,052
That's why I looked into it.

300
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:18,305
-Her friend from middle school lives here.
-Okay.

301
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:20,974
She didn't answer my call,
so I left her a message.

302
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,560
I'll inform you as soon as I get a reply.

303
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:27,272
Starting today, look
into every acquaintance of Jeong Sang-hun.

304
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:30,609
What? We already looked
into his acquaintances.

305
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,070
-Do you know Seo Ju-hyeong is?
-Pardon?

306
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:35,322
Jeong Sang-hun's elementary school friend.

307
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,783
-How about Yount Steffen?
-Yount...

308
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,828
He was Jeong's next-door neighbor
when he studied in Germany.

309
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:43,038
So did you check everyone out?

310
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,126
No, but that guy, Yount--

311
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,711
Follow my order.
Why do you keep talking back?

312
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:54,633
If you're going to talk back at me,
get out of my team.

313
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:57,052
I'm sorry.

314
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,062
Hey, take half.

315
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:16,613
Dae-yong.

316
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,615
Can we talk?

317
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:32,171
Jin-gyeong.

318
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:33,922
Are you all right?

319
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,508
Was I that out of line?

320
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,678
-No, you weren't.
-Why did he yell at me like that?

321
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:44,850
I think we need to keep our investigation
a secret for the time being.

322
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:48,020
It's because of that, right?

323
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,114
-You won't change your mind?
-You're still going to

324
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,699
investigate Choe Su-hyeon's case?

325
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:02,409
I told you it wasn't suicide.

326
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:05,787
It's only circumstantial.
It's not connected to our case.

327
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,581
Don't drag them into it and waste time.

328
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:10,667
I'm trying to figure out
if it's connected or not.

329
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,085
How much longer...

330
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,756
How much longer will you investigate
as you please?

331
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:17,549
Are you the captain?

332
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:21,929
Report everything to me
when you investigate. Got it?

333
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,475
Why are you going this far?

334
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:32,606
You told me that the higher-ups
don't like us to look into this.

335
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:33,857
Are you telling me

336
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:37,402
that they are pressuring you
to stop investigating? Is that why?

337
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,571
Don't jump to conclusions.

338
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,615
The moment we admit Choe Su-hyeon

339
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:43,700
was murdered
and Jeong Sang-hun is connected,

340
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,161
we'll be admitting that we made a mistake.

341
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:50,415
Don't you know people are criticizing us
for not being able to find him?

342
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,626
Is that all?

343
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,172
Tae-sik.

344
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,424
If you

345
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,761
want to investigate
however you want, leave my team.

346
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:06,265
Or...

347
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:09,017
I'll leave the team.

348
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,092
Drink this and calm down.

349
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:52,602
It's Choe Su-hyeon's call history
when she was in Songju.

350
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:57,065
You know? I recognized some names
we're quite familiar with.

351
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,614
The meeting ran long.

352
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:06,908
I'm heading to Seoul now.
Please get the car ready.

353
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,745
Mr. Jin,
you have a visitor in your office.

354
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,830
CEO'S OFFICE

355
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:14,458
JIN YEONG-MIN

356
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:32,350
Seeing you in Sang-hun's seat feels weird.

357
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:35,604
What brings you here?

358
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:39,524
You know Choe Su-hyeon, right?

359
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:44,654
You were the one who stopped her
from publishing her last article.

360
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:47,699
Yes, it was me.

361
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:49,951
Why? What was the article about?

362
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:53,038
-I don't know, either.
-That makes no sense.

363
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:55,415
You stopped it
without knowing the content?

364
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:58,251
-Do you expect me to believe it?
-I had no choice.

365
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,463
That article messed Sang-hun up.

366
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:03,799
What do you mean?

367
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:05,967
Ever since that reporter visited him
at the company,

368
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,262
he said he wouldn't set up
the new business in Songju.

369
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,807
-Why not?
-I don't know why, either.

370
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:15,685
Both of them tried to hide it from me.

371
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:20,607
What I know for certain is that
Sang-hun changed his side because of her.

372
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:24,528
And because of that, I only gave
Bareun News a call. That's it.

373
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:28,907
Is that really all you know?

374
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:38,750
CALL HISTORY

375
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:41,211
JIN YEONG-MIN
IN DONG-GU

376
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,590
Jin Yeong-min and In Dong-gu.

377
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:48,885
These two knew Choe Su-hyeon.

378
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:52,556
They called her
even on the day of her death.

379
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:57,435
Does that mean it is one of them
who visited her place?

380
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,730
Jeon Ho-gyu of RIU.

381
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:02,899
Yes?

382
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,277
Choe Su...

383
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:08,864
Nothing. Please go ahead.

384
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:12,450
Yes.

385
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:14,494
There?

386
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:17,831
Okay. Thank you.

387
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:41,188
CHOE SU-HYEON STAYED
AT HER FRIEND'S IN SONGJU

388
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:44,149
Choe Su-hyeon stayed
at her friend's in Songju.

389
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:07,964
-Hey. Here.
-No thanks.

390
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:16,181
-Are you here because of Choe Su-hyeon?
-Did you reinvestigate?

391
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:17,807
Get in the car.

392
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:33,323
It's murder. Drugs were found
to be present in her body.

393
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:37,744
But I can't conduct
the proper investigation now.

394
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,288
I even had the autopsy in secret.

395
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,082
Why not?

396
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:46,044
The Commissioner-General
is putting some pressure on us.

397
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:50,298
I guess some higher-ups are involved.

398
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,342
Someone above the Commissioner-General?

399
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:54,970
Could it be Father?

400
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:57,847
We can't be sure about anything yet.

401
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:05,605
Can I talk to you later?
I have to go somewhere now.

402
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:09,234
-Where are you going?
-It's about Choe Su-hyeon.

403
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:11,820
-I'll come with you.
-Did you see Detective Jo?

404
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,697
-Jo Tae-sik.
-He went this way.

405
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,323
-This way?
-Yes.

406
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:18,368
All right. Let's go.

407
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:28,712
What is he up to?

408
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:33,008
While Choe Su-hyeon stayed in Songju,

409
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:35,552
she was in touch
with Jin Yeong-min and In Dong-gu.

410
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,556
CALL HISTORY

411
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:45,687
I heard Yeong-min stopped Su-hyeon
from publishing her article.

412
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:49,774
But Yeong-min says he doesn't know
what the article was about.

413
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:51,901
I guess In Dong-gu had similar reasons.

414
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,655
But they called and put pressure on her

415
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:59,701
even on the day of her death when they
didn't even know what it was about?

416
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,412
That doesn't sound right.

417
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:06,666
Anyway, I need to find out what
Choe Su-hyeon was trying to do in Songju.

418
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,127
What was her article about?

419
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:11,671
And why did they have to stop her
by killing her?

420
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:18,053
So are you sure you can come with me?

421
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:20,930
I should.

422
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:25,810
I found out that Su-hyeon died
only a few days ago.

423
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:29,898
I found it strange
that I didn't even get a call.

424
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:33,318
She stayed in my place
until the day before she died.

425
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:37,364
I still can't believe this.
It's so sudden.

426
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:40,742
Were you two close?

427
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:43,161
Yes. Since when we were young.

428
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:47,082
My family moved to Songju
as I entered high school.

429
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:49,542
But I kept in touch with Su-hyeon.

430
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:54,631
And a few months ago,
my sister fell ill and died.

431
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:56,966
Back then, Su-hyeon came
all the way here to Songju

432
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,760
and stayed with me all
through the funeral.

433
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:01,179
Then...

434
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:03,598
is that why she stayed with you?

435
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:05,600
Not really.

436
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:09,604
She was writing an article about Songju.

437
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:11,564
So she asked me to let her stay.

438
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,816
An article?

439
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,193
Do you know what it was about?

440
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:17,153
No, I don't know.

441
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:20,615
I don't know what it was,
but it seemed quite important.

442
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:21,950
She was being very sensitive.

443
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:25,203
She didn't sleep well,
and she was running around everywhere.

444
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:29,332
Do you know if she met someone back then?

445
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,584
Or did anyone come to visit her?

446
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:35,588
Was there anything strange or unusual?

447
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,051
It may be nothing,

448
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:43,972
but Su-hyeon went
to Songju Station quite often.

449
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:46,975
Songju Station?

450
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:54,899
I'll get going. Thanks.

451
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:02,657
I drove her to the station
even the day before she died.

452
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:07,162
That was the strange part if you ask me.

453
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:10,415
She often went to the station.

454
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:13,126
Does that mean she had to go somewhere?

455
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:15,003
No.

456
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:18,047
There's no train
that stops at the station.

457
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:27,015
I've seen these two for a long time.

458
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:31,352
Mr. In sometimes seems too forward,

459
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:37,233
but there's no question
about his loyalty to me.

460
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:41,780
One bad thing about Yeong-min
is that he's too greedy.

461
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:45,658
But he's always been quick-witted
since when he was young.

462
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:47,994
He's always on the side

463
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:50,997
of those who are advantageous to him.

464
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:54,042
He's got a good sense of reality.

465
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:58,171
As long as you treat him well
like you do now,

466
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:00,799
he wouldn't turn his back on you.

467
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:06,679
But I was wondering if you were
prepared for the worst.

468
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:10,767
In case the truth
about the past comes out,

469
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:14,521
which one would you have
to take the bullet?

470
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,648
If you were me,

471
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:19,359
who would you choose?

472
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:22,862
I don't know.

473
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:29,369
Yeong-min says

474
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:31,955
Sang-hun opposed the new business

475
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:33,873
after he met Choe Su-hyeon.

476
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,836
And Choe Su-hyeon was writing
an article in Songju

477
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,712
until just before she died.

478
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:45,218
The message from the culprit
points to Choe Su-hyeon, Kim Seung-cheol,

479
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,391
and Jeong Sang-hun.

480
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:55,478
Now it all makes sense.

481
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:58,648
The night Choe Su-hyeon died,

482
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:01,693
Assemblyman Kim and Mr. Jeong
had a big fight, right?

483
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:03,319
-Yes.
-After that day,

484
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:06,447
Assemblyman Kim sent a message
to the people of Songju RMC

485
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,533
that he'd stop the new business.

486
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:11,327
And he talked with Mr. Jeong
about moving the site.

487
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:13,037
It means

488
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:16,165
they weren't on the same page at first,

489
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:18,751
but after Choe Su-hyeon's death,

490
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:21,296
they joined hands together.

491
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:26,634
Choe Su-hyeon was the one
who brought them together

492
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:29,053
in opposing the new business in Songju.

493
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:31,431
If that's the case,

494
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:35,310
Choe Su-hyeon's article must've been
against the business too.

495
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:40,857
So are you saying Dad, Sang-hun,
and Choe Su-hyeon were working together

496
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:43,318
to stop the new business in Songju?

497
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:45,904
And all three of them are eliminated.

498
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:51,075
But why has the culprit been telling me
everything he did?

499
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:54,913
To warn you?

500
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:57,123
I guess he tried to warn you

501
00:31:57,206 --> 00:32:00,418
that something more terrible will happen
if you oppose the new business.

502
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:04,756
So he wanted you
have the bill passed as soon as possible.

503
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:07,592
Something more terrible?

504
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:13,598
What could be more terrible than this?

505
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:22,982
Choe Su-hyeon's article was stopped.

506
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:27,654
Assemblyman Kim and Mr. Jeong
had to work on it hiding in a hotel.

507
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:30,448
I'm sure they were threatened as well.

508
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,493
Why do you think they opposed it

509
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:36,663
when they were being threatened like that?

510
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:39,707
There must be a good reason for that.

511
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:45,588
Choe Su-hyeon's article
will probably tell us the answer.

512
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:48,883
It looks like
that's what started all of this.

513
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:58,726
Please let me introduce the history of JQ.

514
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:01,562
In 1989, Jeonggeon Metal was established.

515
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:04,357
In 1993, there was
the new factory dedication ceremony

516
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,150
in Gangwon Province.

517
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,945
In 1994, Jeonggeon Steelwork
was established.

518
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:12,156
In 1997, Jeonggeon Trades was established.

519
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,119
And in 1999, there was the 10-year
anniversary ceremony of Jeonggeon.

520
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:18,871
Again in 1999, Jeonggeon Constructions
was established

521
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:21,874
and Jeonggeon Chemicals
was started in 2001.

522
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:23,835
In 2003, there was the new factory

523
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:26,170
dedication ceremony
in North Gyeongsang Province.

524
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:29,340
Hey, Yeong-min. Are you out of your mind?

525
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:31,467
We can never have
the new Headquarters in Songju.

526
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:33,594
You know that better than anyone.

527
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:36,097
Choe Su-hyeon is doing
the right thing now.

528
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:37,515
"The right thing"?

529
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:41,853
I only do things that help me survive.

530
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:45,106
She's the person closest to you.

531
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:48,026
Can you abandon her?

532
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:51,904
I already told Chairman Jeong

533
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:56,034
about what Assemblyman Kim,
Su-hyeon, and you are planning.

534
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:03,541
Yeong-min.

535
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,670
I know I will never change.

536
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:13,301
Sang-hun.

537
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:28,149
Please allow me to introduce
Mr. Jin Yeong-min,

538
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,401
the new CEO of JQ E and F to you.

539
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:44,332
INAUGURATION OF CEO JIN YEONG-MIN

540
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:51,089
I'm CEO Jin Yeong-min

541
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:52,799
of JQ E and F.

542
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:12,235
Excuse me, sir.

543
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:13,861
How may I help you?

544
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,154
I'm a cop.

545
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:18,199
There's no train here.

546
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:19,826
I know that.

547
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,371
Have you seen this woman before?

548
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:11,544
You try so hard.

549
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:13,337
Hey, you'll mess things up

550
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,047
if you keep making a fuss like that.

551
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,718
Hey, you should hide.

552
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:22,430
-Stop being ridiculous and have a seat.
-Dae-yong should never know about this.

553
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:23,639
Okay.

554
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:27,810
Hey, did you get a call from Tae-sik?

555
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:29,687
Did you find out anything
about her article?

556
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:32,398
What was she writing
about the new business?

557
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:36,152
I checked all the email accounts
and uploaded articles under her name,

558
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:39,780
but the whole files were
infected with some virus

559
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:42,575
-and I couldn't find out anything.
-Virus?

560
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:43,784
It was hacked.

561
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:46,120
All right.

562
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:48,039
Like Tae-sik said,

563
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:50,750
she died because of the article
she was writing.

564
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:52,251
I also

565
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:55,171
visited her family
and went through all her stuff,

566
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:57,048
but I couldn't even find

567
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:58,716
one single notebook.

568
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:00,468
After killing Choe Su-hyeon,

569
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:03,596
they destroyed all the data about her.

570
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:08,017
How can we conduct an investigation
with everything gone?

571
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:10,937
Our only hope depends

572
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,564
on how much of this

573
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,735
Choe Su-hyeon anticipated before she died.

574
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:20,821
I mean, she was a reporter.

575
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:23,658
She must've backed up the file,
don't you think?

576
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:26,911
-Backup files?
-Think about it. JQ exercised pressure

577
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:29,372
to have her demoted
to the entertainment team.

578
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:32,124
She wouldn't have kept the original
without a backup.

579
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:36,212
So are you saying there should be
a backup file hidden somewhere?

580
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:40,466
Sure. Even I make several backups
for important data.

581
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:42,218
Unless she's a fool,

582
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:44,762
she must've hidden it somewhere.

583
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:46,681
You know what I mean?

584
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:47,932
Good job, Smarty-pants.

585
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:53,688
Try this. It's good.

586
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:55,564
Okay. I'm eating it.

587
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:59,527
Is something wrong?

588
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:01,195
What do you mean?

589
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,239
You look awful these days.

590
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,491
I thought

591
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:08,619
you promised
not to say that again 15 years ago.

592
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:10,788
I thought you would stop
looking like that one day.

593
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:12,540
But it's just getting steadily worse.

594
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:15,751
Why would you say that about my face?

595
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:18,587
-Dad!
-You startled me.

596
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:21,007
-I haven't seen you for so long.
-Gosh.

597
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,466
You sweetheart.

598
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:27,221
My gosh. Don't be silly.

599
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:28,889
Did you go to the English class?

600
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,391
Yes, I just did.

601
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:32,101
You had a test today. How did it go?

602
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:33,894
Of course it went well.

603
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:36,772
No way. You're not that smart.

604
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:38,774
-Gosh.
-I really did well.

605
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:40,985
-Why are you being like that to her?
-What?

606
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:42,778
She's got the DNA of you and me.

607
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:44,155
There's no way she can be smart.

608
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:45,698
But she's nice and pretty.

609
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:48,617
-Don't you think so?
-What is the good of being nice?

610
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:49,660
She should be smart.

611
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:52,496
It's okay. She just needs to be nice.

612
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,622
Right? Put your bag down.

613
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:54,915
-Let's eat.
-Hey.

614
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,417
What's that thing on your neck?

615
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,002
Did you buy it for her?

616
00:38:58,085 --> 00:39:00,588
Dad's friend gave it to me
in front of my school.

617
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:03,215
Who? Tae-sik?

618
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:06,552
No. What was his name?

619
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:08,679
I got his business card.

620
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:12,308
Anyway, he said he's your close friend,
so I could take it.

621
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:15,061
Really? Give me the business card.

622
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:16,604
Business card?

623
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:20,358
Isn't it expensive?

624
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:22,234
IN DONG-GU, JQ

625
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:23,361
Who is he?

626
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:27,156
It's nothing. Eat your meal.

627
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:28,324
Keep eating.

628
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:32,453
Dad, where are you going?

629
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,001
You're lucky.

630
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:41,128
We're closing down on February,

631
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:43,547
so we're not using
the security camera anymore.

632
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:45,883
The files aren't overwritten,
so we still have the footage.

633
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:47,927
When was it again?

634
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:51,806
I need the footage of February 13 first.

635
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,891
February 13?

636
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,228
Is this her?

637
00:39:57,895 --> 00:40:00,356
She came here for several days in a row.

638
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:02,149
Right.

639
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:08,447
Jeong Sang-hun?

640
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:13,327
Did Choe Su-hyeon come here to meet him?

641
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,206
I wonder why they met up.

642
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:20,918
Are there no security cameras outside?

643
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:25,005
We have one near the lockers.

644
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,430
That's a book, right?

645
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:35,933
They did exchange something in secret.

646
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,103
Will we be able to check that locker?

647
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:43,691
-It's no longer here.
-Pardon?

648
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:45,317
We donated things we don't use

649
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:47,570
after it was decided
that the station would be shut down.

650
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:48,863
Where to?

651
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:50,239
To Songju Library.

652
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:51,574
Let's go.

653
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:56,704
She said she understood.

654
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:58,706
She didn't seem suspicious of it at all.

655
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,167
Come on.
We can't be sure just based on that.

656
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,170
Seo-hui may seem slow-witted,

657
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:07,173
but she has a knack
for blindsiding others once in a while.

658
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:09,633
Then what else could I have done
in that situation?

659
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:11,802
I have to say,
you're hurting my feelings here.

660
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:14,013
Are you trying to blame me for everything?

661
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:15,097
I simply did as you said--

662
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:17,725
Don't try to wash your hands of it
like this.

663
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:19,560
It's not like you did it for free.

664
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:22,354
You blocked the articles
in return for the CEO position.

665
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:25,649
In that regard, you're worse than me.

666
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,902
You went from a party leader
to a presidential candidate.

667
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:29,695
Among us, who has benefited the most?

668
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:31,572
How rude.

669
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:34,533
This is why I can't work
on important things with women.

670
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:36,785
They complain even when
their feelings are slightly hurt.

671
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:37,995
Goodness.

672
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:43,042
My gosh! Mr. Jin is here.

673
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,295
Come on in.

674
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:50,132
DESTINATION - SONGJU LIBRARY

675
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:53,093
Are you really not scared?

676
00:41:56,222 --> 00:42:00,059
Well, it's just that we don't know
what kind of situation awaits us.

677
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:04,438
It could be something
that is too much for you to handle.

678
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:09,318
Don't be too fearless.

679
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:14,114
You feel like you can handle anything
before you experience it,

680
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:15,991
but when you actually encounter it,

681
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:18,410
you fall apart.

682
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:19,912
Nine out of ten people.

683
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:23,791
I've seen many cases like that
while on the job.

684
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:28,671
Do you think

685
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,550
Sang-hun is dead?

686
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:40,266
At some point,

687
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:44,061
I noticed that everyone
looked at me with pitying eyes.

688
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:49,066
In the beginning, everyone I ran into

689
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:50,943
said this to me.

690
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:54,446
"Your husband will come back soon.

691
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:56,532
I'm sure you'll find him."

692
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:58,659
But these days,

693
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:03,831
no one says that to me anymore.
People just tell me to cheer up.

694
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:09,920
And hearing that

695
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,299
is actually hurtful.

696
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:18,721
Am I that much of an idiot for believing
that Sang-hun is still alive?

697
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,015
Just ignore

698
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:24,310
what others say.

699
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:27,354
Ignore what I said earlier too.

700
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:38,657
Are you all right?

701
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:39,742
Yes.

702
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:53,297
Damn it.

703
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,591
Jeez, this is nuts.

704
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:58,761
I'm so anxious.

705
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:01,138
I feel like things have been going haywire

706
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:03,390
since his eye was sent to the news agency.

707
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:05,351
We managed to get this one sorted out,

708
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:08,062
but Seo-hui and those detectives...

709
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:10,147
Those reckless punks

710
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:11,940
won't back down easily.

711
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:15,069
Ms. Nam, are you sure
you got rid of that article completely?

712
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:16,862
Yes, I did my part.

713
00:44:16,945 --> 00:44:19,323
My employees will surely
keep their lips sealed.

714
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:21,367
If word gets out, it won't be from my end.

715
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:23,744
Jeez, you always sound so confident.

716
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:25,454
Anyway, let's push ahead with it quickly.

717
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:27,206
If the bill passes,

718
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:29,291
and if we get started
on the new business right away,

719
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,335
what can they do? Am I wrong, Mr. Jin?

720
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:34,254
He's right.
I'm counting on you as well, Mr. Jin.

721
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:35,839
Don't worry.

722
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:37,716
I'll take care of it and make sure

723
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:39,718
nothing bad happens to you both.

724
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:41,261
Yes, you'd better.

725
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:43,931
After all, that's why
you got the CEO position.

726
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:49,144
All right, let's drink.

727
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,190
I'll remember that.

728
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:59,655
You said earlier
that you were almost here.

729
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:01,323
How much longer?

730
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:03,909
Fifteen minutes, again?

731
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:06,078
All right.

732
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:09,164
In any case, please try to get here
as quickly as possible.

733
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:10,416
Okay.

734
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:17,214
Is everyone in this town
holding a shamanic ritual or what?

735
00:45:20,634 --> 00:45:22,052
Have you ever done it?

736
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:24,471
A shamanic ritual.

737
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:26,515
No, I'm Catholic.

738
00:45:26,598 --> 00:45:28,183
I was born a Christian.

739
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:32,604
Even so, my family held
a shamanic ritual every year.

740
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:36,692
We'd do it in our front yard on Saturday.

741
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:38,861
Then on Sunday,
we'd go to church and pray.

742
00:45:39,945 --> 00:45:42,030
Back then,
I didn't even know that was odd.

743
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:45,451
Your parents must've been desperate
for something.

744
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:50,038
My sister disappeared,

745
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:51,248
right behind me.

746
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:57,421
Tae-sik.

747
00:45:57,588 --> 00:46:00,424
Jo Tae-sik, wait for me.

748
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:02,217
I'm not going with you.

749
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:04,136
Go away!

750
00:46:04,636 --> 00:46:05,637
Stop it.

751
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:07,931
Stop following me!

752
00:46:08,223 --> 00:46:10,517
You're so mean!

753
00:46:13,228 --> 00:46:15,898
Hey, are you really leaving?

754
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:19,693
It happened in a flash,

755
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:22,821
so I still can't believe
that actually happened.

756
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:28,535
I remember hearing her footsteps
following me.

757
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:33,874
I think I heard her shouting at me
to wait up.

758
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:37,586
But when I turned around,
she wasn't there.

759
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:40,464
That was when

760
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:43,050
I learned that someone

761
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:47,137
can just vanish into thin air.

762
00:46:51,808 --> 00:46:54,645
I sort of went through
what you're going through now.

763
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:58,774
One day, two days...
And decades have passed now.

764
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:01,193
The police had given up,

765
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:04,613
and even my mom was saying
it was time to give up.

766
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:07,616
But I just couldn't.

767
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:15,082
I kept being reminded of that moment,
and I got angry whenever that happened.

768
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:18,877
That cycle continued,
and it was wearing me out,

769
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:22,339
but I still couldn't stop

770
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:25,968
because I felt like it was my fault

771
00:47:26,426 --> 00:47:28,053
that my sister went missing.

772
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:35,018
So?

773
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:49,575
This time, I'll do it properly.
I want to find him

774
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:51,368
before it's too late.

775
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:57,124
Because I want your story
to be different from mine.

776
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:12,848
Finally, he's here.

777
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:45,339
-Did you want to talk about something?
-I'll be honest with you.

778
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:49,718
I'd like to join hands with you.

779
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:55,641
This is just between you and me,
but Mr. In is so condescending, you know.

780
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:58,644
He's so stuck-up

781
00:48:59,227 --> 00:49:01,688
that I just assumed he was from
a powerful family. Goodness.

782
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:06,068
His background is worse than mediocre.

783
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:08,904
I can't believe he had the nerve
to boss me around.

784
00:49:08,987 --> 00:49:11,323
I guess you've been harboring a grudge
against him.

785
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:13,742
Well, that's not the only reason.

786
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:18,664
I can't stop thinking
that Jeong Sang-hun's disappearance

787
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:20,749
was his doing.

788
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:23,627
As they say, "Like father, like son."

789
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:27,214
If that bastard killed
Choe Su-hyeon and Kim Seung-cheol,

790
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:29,925
I'm sure he did something
to Jeong Sang-hun as well.

791
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:32,594
He's so loyal to Chairman Jeong

792
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:34,429
that he would even go as far as to kill

793
00:49:34,596 --> 00:49:36,515
the families of those who go against him.

794
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:38,642
I thought it was odd

795
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:41,937
that he struck the deal with Kim Seo-hui
without telling anyone.

796
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:47,234
He's probably trying to keep her
under his thumb

797
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:51,154
and wanted to use Jeong Sang-hun as bait
to do just that.

798
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:55,283
But I have to say, he went
way too far with this one.

799
00:49:57,285 --> 00:49:59,037
If it really was Mr. In's doing,

800
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:01,707
he'll sort out the mess himself.

801
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:04,751
Let's wait and see.

802
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:14,052
Hey, will this tell us?

803
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:17,013
Will we be able to find out
who stole Choe Su-hyeon's file?

804
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:19,683
Yes, it'll take some time though.

805
00:50:22,936 --> 00:50:24,438
This virus...

806
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:26,815
We must track down the IP address
of the one who spread it.

807
00:50:26,898 --> 00:50:28,525
-It's almost done.
-Yes.

808
00:50:28,734 --> 00:50:30,485
Everyone, stop what you're doing.

809
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:33,697
We're from Internal Affairs.
Please cooperate.

810
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:38,410
Everyone in RIU, stop what you're doing

811
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:39,870
and come with us.

812
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:42,914
Sergeant Kang Jin-gyeong
and Corporal Jeon Ho-gyu, right?

813
00:50:44,082 --> 00:50:45,709
-We have to take the computer.
-What?

814
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:47,252
-What are you doing?
-Move aside!

815
00:50:47,335 --> 00:50:49,629
-Move. Hands off!
-Let go!

816
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:51,465
Where is Detective Jo Tae-sik?

817
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:54,009
Where is he?

818
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:56,803
Detective Jo.

819
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:08,064
SONGJU LIBRARY

820
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:13,528
-Just a moment.
-Sure.

821
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:14,488
-Open up!
-What's up?

822
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:17,157
Hello? Tae-sik, we have a problem.

823
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,075
-Ms. Kang, come out!
-I found the key, sir.

824
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:20,619
-Come out!
-What's going on?

825
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:22,954
Some guys from Internal Affairs raided us.

826
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:26,541
I have to keep this short.
Tae-sik, don't come here.

827
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:28,668
-Just don't!
-Damn it.

828
00:51:29,544 --> 00:51:31,713
Hey, what are you talking about?
Can't you explain...

829
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:34,716
What's wrong?

830
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:37,427
I think I should rush back
to the station now.

831
00:51:37,552 --> 00:51:39,179
-Now?
-Yes.

832
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,723
It sounds like something's come up.

833
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:44,810
I'll be back shortly.
Why don't you just head in?

834
00:51:45,393 --> 00:51:46,603
Okay, hurry.

835
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:47,604
All right.

836
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:52,067
Call me if anything happens.

837
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:53,026
Okay.

838
00:51:55,654 --> 00:51:57,239
The lockers from Songju Station?

839
00:51:57,322 --> 00:51:59,199
Yes, they said they donated them
to this library.

840
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:00,742
Just a moment, please. I'll check.

841
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:01,827
Thank you.

842
00:52:07,123 --> 00:52:09,459
I'm sorry. We did receive those lockers,

843
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:12,128
but we threw them out
because they were too old.

844
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:14,756
-What about the things inside them?
-We threw them all out.

845
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,258
Everything?

846
00:52:17,175 --> 00:52:19,094
There were a few books
in one of the lockers.

847
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:21,304
I'm pretty sure we threw everything out.

848
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:24,683
Oh, sir. I think you put them aside.

849
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:27,686
You're right. Those thick books?

850
00:52:27,769 --> 00:52:30,105
-Yes.
-Yes, they're thick books.

851
00:52:30,188 --> 00:52:31,898
-Were they in one of the lockers?
-Yes.

852
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:33,942
Where can I go to have a look at them?

853
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:37,863
I found three or four books
in one of the lockers.

854
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:41,157
I kept them here instead of chucking them
because they were in good condition.

855
00:52:41,741 --> 00:52:44,953
Let's see. I think I put them
somewhere around here.

856
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:46,621
Here they are.

857
00:52:50,041 --> 00:52:53,336
May I borrow these books?

858
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:54,880
-You bastard!
-Come on out!

859
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:57,841
-Hey, what is wrong with police officers
-Come on.

860
00:52:57,924 --> 00:53:00,760
-investigating a case? Why take our stuff?
-Come here.

861
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:02,345
Let go, will you?

862
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:04,264
What the heck is this about?

863
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:08,184
From what I know, even the prosecution
has no right to forcefully--

864
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:09,185
You have some nerve.

865
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:12,564
Do you even know
what you guys are accused of?

866
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:35,587
It looks like a science book.

867
00:53:49,517 --> 00:53:50,477
What is this?

868
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:18,254
A flash drive.

869
00:54:30,141 --> 00:54:31,935
-What's going on?
-Tae-sik.

870
00:54:33,812 --> 00:54:35,146
Detective Jo Tae-sik.

871
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:37,565
I'm Kim Tae-won,
the head of Internal Affairs.

872
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:39,025
So? What are you doing here?

873
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:41,111
I guess you haven't heard the news.

874
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:43,279
Everyone
in the Regional Investigation Unit

875
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:45,949
including yourself
has been removed from all your duties

876
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:48,910
due to an allegation that your team
forged an official document.

877
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:51,788
-What did you say?
-Hand over your phone and ID

878
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:53,415
and come with us.

879
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:58,545
Please hand over your ID and phone.

880
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:10,932
-Take everything!
-Yes, sir.

881
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:12,392
Hurry.

882
00:55:26,197 --> 00:55:30,702
GO YEON-U, GU JIN-JU,
GI HAN-YEONG, KIM YUN-JU

883
00:55:31,911 --> 00:55:33,455
It's a list of people's names.

884
00:55:33,538 --> 00:55:35,957
GO YEON-U, GU JIN-JU,
GI HAN-YEONG, KIM YUN-JU

885
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:39,461
"Gu Jin-ju, Gi Han-yeong..."

886
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:41,463
"Songju, Gangwon Province."

887
00:55:42,213 --> 00:55:43,840
What is this list for?

888
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:51,306
GO YEON-U, GU JIN-JU

889
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:00,398
It's me, sir.

890
00:56:00,982 --> 00:56:03,193
It looks like Kim Seo-hui
got her hands on the list.

891
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:04,944
What should we do?

892
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:08,239
Get started right away.

893
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:23,088
DETECTIVE JO TAE-SIK

894
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:27,675
What?

895
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:29,511
What's going on?

896
00:56:44,025 --> 00:56:45,276
What just happened?

897
00:56:56,371 --> 00:56:58,289
JIN YEONG-MIN

898
00:57:03,002 --> 00:57:04,254
Hello, Mr. Lee.

899
00:57:06,881 --> 00:57:08,174
Mr. In did what?

900
00:57:10,718 --> 00:57:12,720
Follow him right away
and find out where he's headed.

901
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:23,022
STATEMENT

902
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:26,067
We will now begin
the interrogation of Lieutenant Jo Tae-sik

903
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:28,945
regarding the accusation of
forging an official document.

904
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:31,614
This interrogation is being recorded.

905
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:33,032
I'd also like to inform you

906
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:36,453
that anything you say here may affect
the disciplinary decisions against you.

907
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:39,581
All right. Shall we get started, then?

908
00:57:39,664 --> 00:57:40,790
KIM SEO-HUI

909
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:01,311
Your call cannot be connected.

910
00:58:01,394 --> 00:58:03,646
-Please leave a message...
-Why isn't he picking up?

911
00:59:12,006 --> 00:59:13,883
He's killing people to hide it,

912
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:16,177
which means there's something.

913
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:18,930
There were people's names and addresses.

914
00:59:19,013 --> 00:59:20,557
It looked like a list for something.

915
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,642
Find out if this can be restored.

916
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:25,770
What if someone deliberately deleted
the footage?

917
00:59:25,853 --> 00:59:28,106
So they're both from the same village?

918
00:59:28,189 --> 00:59:29,440
Why is Sang-hun in that photo?

919
00:59:29,524 --> 00:59:31,609
I think I can understand him.
Mr. Jeong Sang-hun.

920
00:59:31,693 --> 00:59:33,611
I found something.

921
00:59:33,695 --> 00:59:35,154
She had left a copy of the file.

922
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:36,781
You should've just finished her.

923
00:59:36,864 --> 00:59:38,825
Why did you spare her life?

924
00:59:40,118 --> 00:59:42,120
