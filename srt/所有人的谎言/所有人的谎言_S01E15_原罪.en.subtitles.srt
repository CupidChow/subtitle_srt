1
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:42,459
THIS DRAMA IS A WORK OF FICTION.
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,

2
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:45,170
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGIONS, AND INCIDENTS
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:00,977
Get on his tail.

4
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:05,148
Closer. Surround him.

5
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:17,744
This should be enough.

6
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:22,957
What?

7
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,093
POLICE

8
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:36,012
-Everyone, come with me.
-Get out of the car.

9
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:38,389
Go Seung-won, get out of the car now!

10
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:40,558
Did you not hear us? Go Seung-won!
Get out of the car!

11
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:44,062
Go Seung-won, get out of the car.

12
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,156
Turn around.

13
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:57,784
Turn...

14
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:01,788
Turn around, you bastard!

15
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:16,678
Where's Jeong Sang-hun?

16
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:20,515
Tell me where Jeong Sang-hun is,
you bastard!

17
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:32,610
I'm almost there.

18
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:35,697
I'll be there shortly.

19
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:46,332
ORIGINAL SIN

20
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:55,133
The thing is, I didn't see his face,
so I really don't remember anything.

21
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:56,968
Memory is a funny thing.

22
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:01,806
You may suddenly have flashbacks
if you keep looking at these.

23
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,391
Focus and look.

24
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:06,436
If anyone's face shape or jawline

25
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:09,647
reminds you of his at all, let me know.

26
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:11,274
Next.

27
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:14,360
I really have no idea.

28
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:15,570
Focus, please.

29
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:17,488
Look.

30
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,832
Wait. Can we go back for a second?

31
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:33,254
It could be this guy.

32
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:46,768
UNTIL THE DAY WHEN MOUNT BAEKDU
IS WORN AWAY AND THE EAST SEA RUNS DRY

33
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:49,604
MAY GOD PROTECT AND PRESERVE OUR COUNTRY

34
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:04,244
BAREUN NEWS ENTERTAINMENT TEAM

35
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,004
It's the same handwriting.

36
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,272
YEONG-MIN

37
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:36,150
But will you be okay?

38
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:39,070
Sang-hun might die
if you don't listen to the culprit.

39
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:41,948
Then you should do it.

40
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:44,867
It's what the culprit wants.

41
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,788
Would Sang-hun still be alive?

42
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,376
Hello, Detective.

43
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:55,712
Mr. Go.

44
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,258
On March 6,
you cut off Jeong Sang-hun's hand.

45
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:01,968
Then on the next day, March 7,

46
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:06,556
you sent the hand to Assemblyman Kim's
memorial ceremony. Do you admit it?

47
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:08,641
Yes.

48
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,144
Then do you also admit

49
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:14,022
to cutting off his foot

50
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,983
and leaving it inside the elevator
at Songju RMC

51
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:19,110
on April 3?

52
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,112
Yes.

53
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:23,197
What about extracting his eyeball
and sending it

54
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:25,533
to Bareun News' entertainment team?

55
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:28,536
Yes, that too.

56
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:30,663
Why?

57
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,876
I don't quite get it.

58
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,920
Why did you do all that?

59
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:39,881
What do you get from it?

60
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:43,968
Is it because of Yeon-u?

61
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,889
Did you want to get back at JQ
for what they did to Yeon-u?

62
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:51,726
Is that why you abducted Jeong Sang-hun
and dismembered him alive?

63
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,187
You wanted Chairman Jeong

64
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:56,606
to go through the pain

65
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:58,816
you experienced.

66
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:05,156
What do you think

67
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:07,700
Yeon-u will say?

68
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:11,662
Do you think he'll say,
"Thank you for taking revenge on them"?

69
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:15,083
Will I see him

70
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:18,294
ever again?

71
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,423
I'm sure

72
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,343
he's in a better place by now.

73
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:30,890
How could I see him?

74
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,563
I did it with the full knowledge
of the consequences I'd face. All of it.

75
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,983
I wanted them to experience
the same thing.

76
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,069
It wasn't

77
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,406
just about avenging Yeon-u.

78
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,034
It was something that I had to do

79
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:54,247
to better cope
with the rest of my unfair life.

80
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:00,128
That's why I did it.

81
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:02,213
So?

82
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:06,634
Where is he now?

83
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:10,763
Jeong Sang-hun.

84
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,854
Tae-sik, I don't think he's here.

85
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:20,064
We searched the entire area,

86
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,108
but he's not here.

87
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,152
I see. All right.

88
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:37,165
If he was already outside
when we got there...

89
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:52,555
He's driving away now.

90
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:57,310
He should've fled sooner
if he'd had extra time.

91
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,312
Why was he still there?

92
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:10,323
Did you

93
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:12,366
kill Jeong Sang-hun?

94
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:18,247
Where's the body?

95
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,041
Where did you leave it?

96
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:22,168
I buried it.

97
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:30,218
-I buried the corpse.
-Oh, is that so?

98
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:36,474
Where?

99
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:38,935
Where did you bury him?

100
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:43,272
What's wrong?
Is the location not on this map?

101
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,484
Did you bury him overseas?

102
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,615
He's alive, isn't he?

103
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:01,165
Starting in Cheongju, we've searched
every place that is related to you,

104
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:04,835
but we found no traces of him
except for in the basement of the villa.

105
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:08,923
You had blood on your hands
when you got caught,

106
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,716
as if you had just killed him
or something.

107
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,178
But except for the steering wheel,

108
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,389
not one drop of his blood
was found inside your car.

109
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:17,473
You deliberately smeared

110
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,350
the blood on your hands.

111
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:24,522
You wanted to make us believe
that you killed Jeong Sang-hun.

112
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,027
Where is

113
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:33,864
Jin Yeong-min now?

114
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:40,746
That day, you had over an hour
from the time you arrived at the villa

115
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:43,082
to when you ran into us.

116
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:47,086
What were you doing there
for over an hour and a half?

117
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:51,007
You waited there on purpose
until we arrived, didn't you?

118
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,218
You bought time

119
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,846
so that Jin Yeong-min could flee
with Jeong Sang-hun.

120
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,938
That day, he headed to Cheongju
right after the shareholders' meeting.

121
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,481
But how come we only saw you?

122
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:10,192
Well, you plotted the whole thing

123
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:13,112
so that we couldn't go after him.

124
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,951
He took Jeong Sang-hun.

125
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:22,997
And that means
Jeong Sang-hun is still alive.

126
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:32,256
Why?

127
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,593
Why did you scheme all this
with Jin Yeong-min?

128
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,597
I get that you did it because of Yeon-u,
but in his case,

129
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:43,309
all he cares about is getting rid of
everyone that may get in his way

130
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:46,020
so that he can make JQ his.

131
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,481
Why did you let him rope you

132
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:51,400
into committing such a terrible crime?

133
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,196
Jin Yeong-min

134
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,199
is just taking advantage of you.

135
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:01,494
He used you.

136
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,082
No, you're wrong.

137
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:15,132
We share the same wound.

138
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:17,468
And that's why

139
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,304
we began the whole thing together.

140
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,644
Jin Yeong-min, that guy...

141
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:29,855
Just like me,

142
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:37,238
he also lost someone
who was dearest to him.

143
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:40,866
"Someone who was dearest"?

144
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:43,369
What do you mean?

145
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:49,792
Choe Su-hyeon.

146
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,517
I really don't know anymore.

147
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,772
Did all of this begin because of you?

148
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,943
Or was it because of me?

149
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,827
-Hey, Eun-seong!
-Yeong-min.

150
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:27,663
It's been such a long time.

151
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:28,914
-Right?
-Yes.

152
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:31,834
-How have you been?
-Good, of course. What about you?

153
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,712
-I've been well too, of course.
-Yeong-min.

154
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,297
-Mr. Jeong.
-Hi.

155
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,676
Call him Sang-hun from now on.

156
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:42,386
Sorry?

157
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,513
You mean, Eun-seong?

158
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:48,684
Yeong-min, I need you
to look after Sang-hun from now on.

159
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,187
Make sure no one bullies him

160
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,523
and that he doesn't put himself in danger.
Take good care of him, okay?

161
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,487
You can take him.

162
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:02,448
Let's go, Sang-hun.

163
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:05,451
Did you have fun on your bike?

164
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,668
All my life,

165
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:18,255
I was never chosen by anyone.

166
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,549
Do you know how that feels?

167
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,142
The cafeteria food sucks.
Let's just go to the snack shop.

168
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,478
-Let's go.
-Oh, hey.

169
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,772
-Sang-hun.
-Hi.

170
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:36,941
-I heard you're getting the new phone.
-Yes.

171
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:40,653
You can use it as an MP3 player as well.
Can you just give me your old phone?

172
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,739
Don't be ridiculous.
He'll obviously give it to Yeong-min.

173
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:46,992
Why do you even study?

174
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,995
Exactly. Just be Sang-hun's minion
for the rest of your life.

175
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,289
All right.

176
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,291
I don't want to be called a minion,

177
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,460
so I'll be his butler from now on.
You all got that?

178
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,629
-"Butler"?
-That sure is something to brag about.

179
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,048
-I think it'd be pretty nice.
-Come on.

180
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:02,758
But that became my everyday life,

181
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,344
and I got used to it.

182
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:17,856
Are you bored?

183
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:19,942
No.

184
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:22,069
Why do you keep checking the time?

185
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,321
It's just a habit.

186
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,326
All right.

187
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:31,328
-From now on--
-Gosh.

188
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,414
Don't work so hard.

189
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,336
Don't be too anxious,
and don't try too hard.

190
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,549
I like you just the way you are now.

191
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:47,553
Let's just take it easy
and live happily ever after.

192
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,098
Okay?

193
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:56,687
That was my first time

194
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,815
hearing that I don't have to try so hard

195
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:04,987
and that I can be loved
for just the way I am.

196
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,954
But I lost her like that.

197
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,918
I never even had a chance to thank her.

198
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:21,003
Because of you.

199
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,506
And because of me.

200
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:36,060
Mr. Choi will purchase the land
for the business complex.

201
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:38,479
-And because of them.
-I see.

202
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,023
What about the price?

203
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:52,868
Why Sang-hun? Why did it have to be him?

204
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,453
-Ms. Kim.
-How...

205
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,081
Why are you using Sang-hun
to get your revenge?

206
00:15:57,164 --> 00:16:00,542
-Calm down.
-He tried to help you!

207
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:01,627
But he did nothing.

208
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:06,548
That guy

209
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,635
did nothing after all.

210
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:16,767
Can you do anything?

211
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,443
What do you mean?
What do you mean by that?

212
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:27,903
-Enough.
-What does that mean?

213
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,905
-Stop.
-What do you mean by that?

214
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,545
My gosh, sir.

215
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,213
Sir! Please...

216
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,511
I'm a worthless good-for-nothing,

217
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:56,140
so I don't care what happens to me,

218
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:57,683
but Dong-gu...

219
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,643
Dong-gu is...

220
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,646
Not him, sir.

221
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,693
Please, I beg you.

222
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:13,323
Please help him just this one time.

223
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:17,036
Please help my son, Dong-gu.

224
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,747
Just this once, please.

225
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,752
Please save him, sir.

226
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:28,047
Sir...

227
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:30,966
Look, Mr. Son.

228
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:38,057
Raising a child is certainly
not an easy job, right?

229
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,893
I've lived long enough,

230
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:46,482
so I feel that I can have my way
with most things.

231
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:49,193
But strangely enough,

232
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:52,654
I don't feel that way with my son.

233
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,617
What can you do though?

234
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:02,623
Only parents give unconditional love
no matter what their children do.

235
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:09,797
Right?

236
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:40,536
Sang-hun

237
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:42,913
is probably with Yeong-min, right?

238
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:45,958
Yes, probably.

239
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:50,671
We've put out an APB, and I sent
the entire team out to find him.

240
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,841
I failed to put a stop
on the new business,

241
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:57,970
so I guess he doesn't want
to send Sang-hun home.

242
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,684
If things end like this...

243
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:04,601
No.

244
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:08,897
Focus on how far we've come.
Don't give up just yet.

245
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:17,865
Tae-sik, In Dong-gu was released
from the detention center.

246
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:19,616
What do you mean?

247
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,286
Apparently, someone turned himself in
instead of In Dong-gu.

248
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,414
Damn it.

249
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:30,586
This is nuts.

250
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,754
There's firm evidence that proves
he is the killer.

251
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:34,548
"Firm evidence"?

252
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,718
We're only going by Yu Dae-yong's words.

253
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,429
Aside from Yu Dae-yong's statement,
there's nothing.

254
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:43,015
We have nothing other than the statement

255
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:44,600
about how In Dong-gu gave some orders.

256
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:47,102
He got information from Yu Dae-yong
using a burner phone

257
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,104
and gave him orders.
Isn't that enough evidence?

258
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:54,067
There's no evidence to prove
that it was In Dong-gu's phone.

259
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,777
It's not like he confessed.

260
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,197
He's denying all the allegations
at the moment.

261
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,450
And Son Du-gang turned himself in,
saying he did it

262
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:02,743
and that the phone was his.

263
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:05,037
He gave us a detailed statement
about the crimes,

264
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:06,788
so we have no choice.

265
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,586
We found Choi Chi-deuk
and Kim Pil-yeon's clothes

266
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,464
as well as Assemblyman Kim's dashcam
at Son Du-gang's place.

267
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:18,342
This is nuts.
You know that this makes no sense.

268
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:23,305
This man, Son Du-gang, is just trying
to take the fall for his son.

269
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,099
Then what about
the attempted murder charge?

270
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,268
What will you do about that?

271
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,771
All the officers who were at the scene

272
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:33,523
heard In Dong-gu
giving an order to kill me

273
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,317
and even saw him
trying to kill me himself.

274
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,071
Is Son Du-gang saying
that was his doing as well?

275
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:42,282
We decided to investigate it
without detaining him.

276
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,244
So regarding the other charges,

277
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,455
you'll have to bring firm evidence
to prove that In Dong-gu is the culprit.

278
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,874
Then we'll issue
another arrest warrant then.

279
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,797
It's better that I do this

280
00:20:57,547 --> 00:21:01,093
because I've been behind bars before.

281
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:06,306
And you don't deserve
to be locked up here.

282
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:07,933
Don't kid yourself.

283
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:10,560
Do not think

284
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:13,146
that I'll forgive you

285
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,482
for what you did to Mom and me

286
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,612
just because you're doing this for me.

287
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:25,867
I stopped thinking of you as my family
years ago.

288
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,043
Take care of yourself.

289
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:50,559
I know that you're a busy man,

290
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,352
but you must've been all over the place

291
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:54,896
because you've had to assist the chairman

292
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,941
while helping Mr. Jin
organize the shareholders' meeting.

293
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,697
Where is Mr. Jin?

294
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:05,907
I don't know.

295
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:11,413
Chairman Jeong knows everything.

296
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:14,791
Well, had I known his whereabouts,

297
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,210
I would've told you
as soon as the meeting was over.

298
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:19,421
I mean, I need to survive too.

299
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:21,673
Why would I protect someone
who has nothing now?

300
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,217
Anyway, I really don't know where he is.

301
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:29,306
I should've known when they entrusted
Kim Seo-hui with that huge task.

302
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:36,063
Jeong Yeong-mun has figured out

303
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:38,815
that Jin Yeong-min
is holding his son hostage

304
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:40,734
to destroy his company.

305
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:45,864
That's probably why he got In Dong-gu out.
It was to catch Jin Yeong-min.

306
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,367
He wants to use In Dong-gu
to get rid of Jin Yeong-min

307
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:51,036
and get Jeong Sang-hun back.

308
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:53,705
Then what about Jin Yeong-min?

309
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:58,001
What if Jin Yeong-min sensed all that?

310
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,504
What could he have done?

311
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:03,381
Where would Jin Yeong-min go?

312
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:09,262
-Hey. What?
-Tae-sik.

313
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,264
You were right about that.

314
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:15,685
Jin Yeong-min, that jerk went the opposite
direction that Seung-won headed.

315
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:21,983
But the place where he was last filmed
by the security camera is Seoul tollgate.

316
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,068
SEOUL TG

317
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:25,237
I must say he's very gutsy.

318
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:27,697
Why do you think he came
back to Seoul after running away?

319
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:32,953
He came back to Seoul?

320
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:39,167
Who would cooperate with Jin Yeong-min
to help him achieve his goal?

321
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,005
Kim Seo-hui?

322
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,222
NO CALLER ID

323
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:55,142
Hello?

324
00:23:57,811 --> 00:23:58,770
Hello?

325
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:01,690
Hello?

326
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:06,319
Yeong-min?

327
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:09,823
Sang-hun is doing...

328
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:11,950
I mean, he's still alive.

329
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,913
But he won't last for a long time.

330
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,665
No.

331
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,334
No, Yeong-min.

332
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,378
So, Seo-hui.

333
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:26,256
Listen carefully to what I say.

334
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:28,717
This is the last time.

335
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:31,845
I have no other choice.

336
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:36,016
Okay. What is it?

337
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:39,603
Your father had the evidence.

338
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:42,355
You have to find it.

339
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:45,400
"Evidence"? My dad had it?

340
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:47,444
What evidence?

341
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,206
From the beginning,

342
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,168
you were the only one who could do this.

343
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:06,129
Seo-hui.

344
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:07,756
Find it no matter what.

345
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:09,883
Yeong-min?

346
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:13,094
Yeong-min, I don't know
what you are talking about.

347
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:15,764
What am I supposed to find?

348
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:20,477
Yeong-min.

349
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:23,146
Yeong-min. Yeong-min!

350
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:24,940
Yeong-min!

351
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,161
Yeong-min...

352
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,211
JIN YEONG-MIN

353
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,935
Mr. Jin was going to use Kim Seo-hui
from the beginning.

354
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:06,064
He just let her do what she wanted
knowing what she was up to.

355
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:08,858
To make her stop the new business.

356
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:35,719
Seo-hui.

357
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:58,992
I asked the patrol division for help.

358
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:00,910
They will start the search soon.

359
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,331
What did Jin Yeong-min say?

360
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:07,208
Did he say anything about Mr. Jeong?

361
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:09,002
Evidence.

362
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:11,129
He told me to find evidence.

363
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:12,672
What evidence?

364
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:17,093
I guess he meant the evidence
that JQ contaminated Songju.

365
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,180
And he says my dad had the evidence.

366
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:24,059
He wants me to find it,
but I'm not sure what he means.

367
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:27,020
He said this is the last chance.

368
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:29,147
It will be all over once he gets caught.

369
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:31,691
And he still wants to find the evidence?

370
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:36,488
He still wants to stop the new business.

371
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:40,742
Why...

372
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:15,545
Where's Mr. Jeong?

373
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:19,674
Where did you hide Jeong Sang-hun?

374
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:32,687
How would I know that, you idiot?

375
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:03,134
Mr. Hong.

376
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:04,969
"Consent to her arrest"?

377
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:08,556
Isn't it enough that you've already
dismissed her from the party?

378
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:10,308
Do you really have to do this?

379
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:13,686
She's under suspicion
of a serious offense, so we had no choice.

380
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,563
She's done as she was told.

381
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:17,899
Seo-hui

382
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:20,026
became an assemblywoman

383
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,070
and proposed the bill.

384
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:24,280
-She did all that. But why--
-I wish

385
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:27,659
she only did what she was told to do.

386
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:31,621
I gave you Assemblyman Kim's documents
only on one condition.

387
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:35,208
I just wanted your daughter
to simply do her job well

388
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:38,127
until the bill was passed

389
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,713
without causing any problem
or arousing suspicion.

390
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:44,384
But look at what she's done.

391
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:47,428
It's you who broke your promise, not me.

392
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:52,725
Why did you let her do
whatever she wanted?

393
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:55,270
You knew how she would end up.

394
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:59,399
You've already learned your lesson
with your husband's case.

395
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:04,612
Ma'am.

396
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:08,324
It's all my fault.

397
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:10,285
I'm begging you for mercy.

398
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:13,454
Please spare my daughter.

399
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,081
Please.

400
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,667
Please forgive my family, sir.

401
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,752
There's no use in begging me like this.

402
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,088
You already know

403
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:25,341
who's behind all this.

404
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,624
What are you doing in there?

405
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:03,546
What's all this?

406
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,715
Why are you searching
through your dad's stuff?

407
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:11,220
Did you not hear me? What are you doing?

408
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:14,349
Mom, Dad had the evidence

409
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:16,893
that Father contaminated
the land in Songju.

410
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,603
Do you know anything?

411
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:22,899
Was there any stuff
that Dad tried to keep safe?

412
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:24,233
What would you do with that?

413
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:27,445
Why? Will you hold a press conference
or something again?

414
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:29,155
Do you still not get it?

415
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:31,574
Do you want to fall even further down
than now?

416
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:35,244
Please.

417
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:37,205
Seo-hui, please.

418
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:40,500
Please don't do anything.

419
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:43,378
Just stay still unless you want to die.

420
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:46,547
Do you want to end up like your dad?

421
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:54,555
You knew it, Mom.

422
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:58,309
You knew that Dad had the evidence.

423
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:00,269
Right.

424
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:03,523
That's why Dad was killed, right?

425
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:06,067
I can't believe this.

426
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:09,904
Why did you pretend not to know
all that when you actually did?

427
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:13,324
Tell me. What's the evidence?

428
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:16,160
Mom.

429
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:18,705
What is it you know?

430
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:22,041
This isn't just
about Chairman Jeong's crime.

431
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,465
PHARMACY

432
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:30,883
Hello.

433
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,761
I need antiphlogistic
and compression bandage.

434
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,263
Okay. Please wait.

435
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:38,766
Here.

436
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:40,435
Thank you.

437
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:45,064
Sir, you didn't take your change.

438
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:51,571
This is Road 1278, Yeonhwa-dong.

439
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:53,072
He was filmed here.

440
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:55,116
Then he moved in his car.

441
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:57,785
As you can see,

442
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:00,538
he was last filmed by the security
camera at Seoul tollgate.

443
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:03,833
But we haven't been able to locate him
after that.

444
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:05,877
He hasn't even used his cards.

445
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,879
And there's nothing in his call history.

446
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:08,963
A pharmacy?

447
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,506
We just can't narrow it down.

448
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:13,134
He must've used national highways
not to get caught.

449
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:14,260
What's the address?

450
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:16,387
Check all the security cameras
on national highways.

451
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:18,514
-And set up roadblocks for inspection.
-Thank you.

452
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:19,682
-Okay.
-There's a witness.

453
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:22,185
A guy who looks like Jin Yeong-min bought

454
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:24,687
bandage and antiphlogistic
at a pharmacy 30 minutes ago.

455
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:26,272
"Bandage and antiphlogistic"?

456
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:28,066
Yes. Apparently, he was bleeding.

457
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,152
Where was he witnessed?

458
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:33,071
Road 34, Yeongil-myeon, Songju.

459
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:35,073
Songju...

460
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,577
We should go there first.

461
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,703
-Okay.
-Okay.

462
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:47,960
Tae-sik.

463
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:51,214
Do you really think
Jeong Sang-hun is there?

464
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:53,341
He can't carry
Jeong Sang-hun around in a car

465
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:55,510
when he's in critical condition.

466
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:57,470
People might have seen him if he did.

467
00:34:57,553 --> 00:35:00,056
I'm sure they are there somewhere.

468
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:02,558
Jin Yeong-min and Jeong Sang-hun.

469
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:06,646
Here. See for yourself.

470
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:14,403
AGREEMENT

471
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,115
What is this?

472
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:20,618
KIM SEUNG-CHEOL, JEONG YEONG-MUN

473
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:25,456
AGREEMENT

474
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,542
Please trust me, Assemblyman Kim.

475
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:31,921
This is the only way
that can protect everyone.

476
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,715
We can keep our power this way

477
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:39,387
and atone for the past by using that power
to improve the world.

478
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:40,888
Once

479
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:43,141
you sign the agreement,

480
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:45,810
JQ will step forward

481
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:50,356
to help your legislative activities
in the National Assembly.

482
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:52,233
That's not what I'm asking for.

483
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:53,776
It was you

484
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,655
who brought Jeonggeon Steelwork
into Songju

485
00:35:58,197 --> 00:35:59,574
20 years ago.

486
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:01,617
Thanks to the economic effect,

487
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:04,453
you became the first assemblyman
of the ruling party

488
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:08,124
in Songju, which typically supports
the opposition party.

489
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:10,626
Once this is made public,

490
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:14,714
even you won't be
able to get away with it.

491
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:18,384
Even if you say you didn't know,

492
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:20,803
no one will believe you.

493
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:24,891
It was you

494
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:27,351
who was in charge of
the environmental assessment

495
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:29,520
and lift the restrictions
on Jeonggeon Steelwork.

496
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:31,522
Chairman Jeong, you...

497
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:35,026
It's not like

498
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:37,987
your reputation is your own.

499
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:40,364
You should think of your family.

500
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:47,205
Instead of raking over the past
that will only tarnish our reputations,

501
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:51,250
we should rather work together
for a better future.

502
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:53,794
Don't you think that would be better
for both of us?

503
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:03,221
They agreed not to reveal

504
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:06,349
that Jeonggeon Steelwork was
the cause of contamination?

505
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:09,977
KIM SEUNG-CHEOL, JEONG YEONG-MUN

506
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:11,812
Dad did this?

507
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:16,442
He knew all this?

508
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:22,114
Dad knew that people were dying,

509
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:25,993
but he still covered up for JQ?

510
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:30,665
-My dad?
-Yes.

511
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:34,669
That's the evidence
you've been looking for.

512
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:37,713
And it's the truth about your dad.

513
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:44,845
-Ma'am.
-Mr. Kang.

514
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:46,931
Did you know all this?

515
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:49,976
Mr. Kang had been with your dad

516
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:52,228
since he ran for election in Songju.

517
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:54,021
Do you think he didn't know?

518
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:57,858
Did you...

519
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,944
Did you really know all this?

520
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,244
Everything...

521
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:11,664
The whole thing has been
right in front of me.

522
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:15,293
The truth I've been looking for

523
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:17,795
was right in front of my eyes.

524
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:23,843
Why did you not say anything?

525
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:26,762
You watched the whole thing beside me.

526
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:29,098
Because he couldn't kill your dad twice.

527
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,934
He devoted his whole life
to helping others.

528
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:34,270
He overlooked this one thing.

529
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:38,774
And your dad's life was about to fall
into a ditch because of that.

530
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:41,569
Do you expect me
to have sat by and let it happen?

531
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:44,530
What about our family? I mean,

532
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:48,284
Chairman Jeong wouldn't have
left us in peace if things were revealed.

533
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:50,870
It was the agreement that kept him quiet.

534
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,582
You want to know why I did all that?

535
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:57,168
Do you think we even had a choice?

536
00:38:58,044 --> 00:39:00,963
We didn't do it because we wanted to.

537
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:03,215
We had to survive.

538
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:05,009
We needed to survive.

539
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:08,012
When we were living a good life
and keeping our silence,

540
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:11,432
people in Songju died
without even knowing why.

541
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:15,353
Had at least one of us

542
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:18,147
spoken up and exposed them,

543
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:21,400
we wouldn't have been here
in the first place.

544
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:25,363
We could have been able to stop Father.

545
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:29,867
And Sang-hun wouldn't have been kidnapped.

546
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:31,285
So what's your plan?

547
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:34,747
You're going to throw dirt
on your father's name?

548
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,374
Can you really do that to him?

549
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:39,043
Seo-hui.

550
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:42,463
You have already seen the consequences.

551
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:44,423
So you should

552
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:47,510
just turn a blind eye. Okay?

553
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:51,722
Can we

554
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:53,849
just

555
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:56,519
live a quiet life?

556
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:10,282
GONGWON-RI IN YEONGIL-MYEON, SONGJU
WAS SELECTED AS REDEVELOPMENT AREA

557
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:17,998
Everyone, get to your assigned places. Go.

558
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,333
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

559
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:45,276
Hello, ma'am. I'm from the police.

560
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,069
Have you seen any suspicious man
around here?

561
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:48,696
No, I haven't.

562
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:50,239
Okay. Thank you.

563
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:06,172
Tae-sik.

564
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:47,713
Damn it.

565
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:14,448
Shit.

566
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:50,359
Okay. So you couldn't find him?

567
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:53,612
We're still searching for him,

568
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:55,406
so please be patient for a bit longer.

569
00:42:57,783 --> 00:42:58,617
Okay.

570
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:01,829
We're holding an inspection.

571
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:07,751
WILL ASSEMBLYWOMAN KIM
BE ARRESTED FOR MISUSING FUNDS?

572
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:15,676
AGREEMENT

573
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:25,853
Ms. Kim.

574
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,564
Are you sure about your decision?

575
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:31,358
The party will consent

576
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:33,944
to me being arrested
either today or tomorrow.

577
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:36,697
I must disclose this before that happens.

578
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:38,782
To me,

579
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:40,909
today's audit is my last chance.

580
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:42,995
If you disclose the agreement
during the audit,

581
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:45,205
it will have a huge impact on the audit.

582
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:48,083
Both the late assemblyman and you

583
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:50,210
will be criticized.

584
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:52,212
I've braced myself for it.

585
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:56,759
Please get in.

586
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:16,528
This isn't the way to Yeouido.

587
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:19,990
Mr. Kang.

588
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:22,117
Where are we going?

589
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:23,452
I'm sorry, Ms. Kim.

590
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:26,997
I cannot let the entire life
of the late assemblyman be tainted

591
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:29,416
just because of one mistake in his past.

592
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:32,419
Turn the car around now.

593
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:34,296
Mr. Kang.

594
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:08,497
Please go in.

595
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:25,597
Father.

596
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:49,288
AGREEMENT

597
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:06,513
How could you be so dense?

598
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:11,226
I gave you so many chances.

599
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:13,270
You are

600
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:16,732
disappointing me even to the very end.

601
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:22,779
The audit is about to begin.

602
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:24,490
Why hasn't Ms. Kim arrived yet?

603
00:46:24,781 --> 00:46:26,408
Do you think something happened to her?

604
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:31,121
Get me the list for tomorrow's
groundbreaking ceremony in Songju.

605
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:33,290
Let me go this instant.

606
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:36,251
This will not make me change my mind.

607
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:39,129
Why are you going so far?

608
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:42,549
I should ask you, Father.
Why are you going so far?

609
00:46:43,008 --> 00:46:44,885
You know what Yeong-min wants.

610
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:47,554
And you also know
Sang-hun's life depends on it.

611
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:48,680
So

612
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:52,476
you're going to cave
into that bastard's blackmail

613
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:55,229
and be a traitor
to your own father and me?

614
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:57,022
You are the traitor, Father.

615
00:46:58,273 --> 00:46:59,691
Do you still not see it?

616
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:02,611
This all happened because of you.

617
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:06,865
Father, do you not care
about losing Sang-hun?

618
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:10,994
I will not lose anything.

619
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:13,413
Sang-hun or my company.

620
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:16,667
You really won't change your mind.

621
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:21,505
If you are not going to stay silent,

622
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:25,842
I'll make you stay silent.

623
00:47:33,433 --> 00:47:34,601
As soon as the audit is over,

624
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:37,271
the national assembly will consent
to your arrest.

625
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:40,232
Once you get investigated
by the prosecution,

626
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:43,652
you will never think
of going against my decision.

627
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:48,323
You did not

628
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:52,202
care about anyone, to begin with.

629
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:55,205
Not even about Sang-hun.

630
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:58,625
You only care about yourself.

631
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:02,087
You murderer.

632
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:06,967
You're the real devil.

633
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:10,846
I...

634
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:13,098
contributed a lot

635
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:16,226
to the good of this country
as well as the world.

636
00:48:16,768 --> 00:48:19,646
The good of your father
and Yeong-min, too.

637
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:22,941
You guys are at fault
for trying to bring me down

638
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:26,153
just because of a mere mistake I made,
despite everything I've done for you.

639
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:28,614
I was right to punish such ungratefulness.

640
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:34,786
And you will also pay
for your actions, Seo-hui.

641
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:37,956
And Yeong-min will soon
pay for his action, too.

642
00:48:42,127 --> 00:48:43,337
Mark my words.

643
00:48:44,504 --> 00:48:45,631
You will

644
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:50,802
have to pay for all of the crimes
you have committed.

645
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:04,316
Give her a day to think about it.

646
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:06,902
If she changes her mind, bring her
to the groundbreaking ceremony.

647
00:49:06,985 --> 00:49:07,986
If she doesn't,

648
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:09,780
hand her over to the prosecution.

649
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,658
Yes, sir.
I will escort you to Songju Hotel.

650
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:27,214
Tae-sik, we searched everywhere,
but we still couldn't find him.

651
00:49:27,422 --> 00:49:28,924
I don't think he's in Yeongil-myeon.

652
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:33,887
-I couldn't find him.
-Same here.

653
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:35,222
Expand our search.

654
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:36,640
Search other districts as well.

655
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:37,683
Yes, sir.

656
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:39,059
I'm sure he's in Songju.

657
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:41,436
He probably couldn't have left
given his current situation.

658
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,354
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

659
00:49:42,437 --> 00:49:44,272
-Okay.
-Let's go.

660
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:56,702
I have located Jin Yeong-min in Songju.

661
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,121
The police have expanded their search

662
00:49:59,204 --> 00:50:00,872
and are continuing their search
in the area.

663
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:02,374
Okay.

664
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:06,002
Let me know as soon as you hear something.

665
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:13,593
I want to be alone.

666
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:35,866
You...

667
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:42,956
I thought

668
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:48,503
that you and I needed to have
an honest conversation at least once.

669
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:11,943
Where is Sang-hun right now?

670
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:18,909
Even now, you only want to know

671
00:51:21,661 --> 00:51:22,662
about Sang-hun.

672
00:51:28,126 --> 00:51:29,252
Do you remember

673
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:34,299
how I was brought to your house
in the first place?

674
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:40,555
Several days after you adopted Eun-seong,

675
00:51:41,973 --> 00:51:44,059
he ran away to the orphanage.

676
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:47,103
He said that he was scared of you.

677
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:50,315
He said that he did not belong there.

678
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:53,902
He said he didn't need new parents

679
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:59,324
and asked if he could continue
to live at the orphanage with me.

680
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:10,544
That's when he started to confuse me.

681
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:18,593
I desperately wanted to have parents,

682
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:24,599
but it was so easy for him to say
that he didn't need them.

683
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:30,897
I hated him, but at the same time,

684
00:52:31,356 --> 00:52:32,858
I couldn't abandon him.

685
00:52:37,779 --> 00:52:39,573
He was the only one

686
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:42,534
who needed me in this world.

687
00:52:48,206 --> 00:52:49,374
I shouldn't

688
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:53,920
have brought you to my house that day.

689
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:07,475
I was really young back then.

690
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:15,358
But I already knew

691
00:53:18,737 --> 00:53:20,113
that you brought me

692
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:25,535
only so that Eun-seong could
form an attachment to you more easily.

693
00:53:31,082 --> 00:53:34,336
When you were using me, you pretended
that you were being generous with me.

694
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:38,840
Sometimes, you would pretend
that you actually cared for me

695
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:41,343
and you made me obey your orders

696
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:53,188
because you knew what I feared.

697
00:53:58,485 --> 00:54:00,862
I was always anxious
that you might abandon me

698
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:06,993
which made me hang onto you
more desperately like a pathetic loser.

699
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:16,586
That's how you always used people.

700
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:24,302
You got hold of people's weaknesses

701
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:27,013
they buried deep in their hearts

702
00:54:29,307 --> 00:54:31,101
and strangled people with them.

703
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:16,271
Are you saying

704
00:55:16,896 --> 00:55:19,274
that this is all my fault?

705
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:22,569
Do you have the right to say that to me?

706
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:27,032
It was you who came up
with the plan for the new business

707
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:30,493
and told me what that reporter

708
00:55:31,077 --> 00:55:32,454
was investigating.

709
00:55:33,705 --> 00:55:35,957
I know why you did that.

710
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:39,711
You were probably scared

711
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:44,924
that your girlfriend might find out
how much you were involved in this.

712
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:49,137
That's why you wanted me to stop her.

713
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:50,680
Isn't that right?

714
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:54,684
I wanted you to stop her, not kill her.

715
00:55:55,268 --> 00:55:57,395
You have yourself to blame
for being short-sighted.

716
00:55:58,897 --> 00:56:02,192
How dare you plot a scheme against me
just to take revenge for your girl!

717
00:56:03,401 --> 00:56:04,819
Don't make excuses.

718
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:06,654
You just

719
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:10,158
wanted to get rid of Sang-hun
and oust me from my position.

720
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:14,537
That is the real reason
behind plotting this scheme of yours.

721
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:18,083
You were simply greedy

722
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:20,794
for things that you don't deserve.

723
00:56:23,505 --> 00:56:24,422
"Greedy"?

724
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:30,804
It's disgusting to hear such an accusation
from you of all people.

725
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:35,517
Everything was a mirage.

726
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:39,729
Everything I chased after

727
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:43,024
and everything you gave me.

728
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:48,279
You do have a point.

729
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:53,618
I was unable to let go
of that useless mirage

730
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:57,997
and caused her to face such an end.

731
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:01,918
That's how we all got here.

732
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:36,703
So you should tell the world
what you have done and give up.

733
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:39,998
Cancel the groundbreaking ceremony
and tell the truth.

734
00:57:40,081 --> 00:57:43,418
Because of what you did,
residents of that area died

735
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:46,504
and more residents are still dying.

736
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:52,510
And tell the world about all the victims
you sacrificed to cover this up.

737
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:55,472
All of it.

738
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:00,518
To cover up your mistake,

739
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:03,521
you committed too many crimes.

740
00:58:06,524 --> 00:58:07,984
You must end it now

741
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:27,003
for you and me.

742
00:58:28,421 --> 00:58:29,881
And for Sang-hun as well.

743
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:34,010
What has Sang-hun done wrong?

744
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:36,638
-Why did you drag him into this?
-You adopted him.

745
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:43,228
And he had me as his friend.
I could say that's what he did wrong.

746
00:58:45,104 --> 00:58:47,857
And the only person who can stop you

747
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:52,403
is Sang-hun, isn't it?

748
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:57,075
I only have one demand.

749
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:01,412
Confess to all of your crimes

750
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:03,706
and resign
from your chairmanship voluntarily.

751
00:59:06,292 --> 00:59:08,336
This is your last chance from me.

752
00:59:14,425 --> 00:59:15,301
Choose.

753
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:20,056
Choose between your only son's life

754
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:21,641
and your company.

755
01:00:12,734 --> 01:00:15,028
Ambulance. Call the ambulance now!

756
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:16,696
Did you find Sang-hun?

757
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:20,283
I believe that revealing the truth

758
01:00:20,366 --> 01:00:23,036
is a way to repent
of my father's wrongdoing.

759
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:25,580
It's all Yeong-min's doing!

760
01:00:26,164 --> 01:00:27,624
Why won't you admit your fault?

761
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:30,293
No one can dare lay a finger on us.

762
01:00:30,835 --> 01:00:34,130
Jin Yeong-min, that bastard.
What the heck is he thinking?

763
01:00:34,213 --> 01:00:36,215
Now, you need to find me.

764
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:37,592
That can't be.

765
01:00:37,675 --> 01:00:40,053
If I can, I want to bring
everything back to its places.

766
01:00:42,096 --> 01:00:44,098
