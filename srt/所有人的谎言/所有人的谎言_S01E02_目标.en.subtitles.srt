3
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,037
Jeong Sang-hun!

4
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,416
-Honey.
-You knew it was me. Why didn't you stop?

5
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:28,505
-Will you keep on avoiding me?
-I know what you're thinking.

6
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,715
-You know? And this is what you do?
-Later.

7
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:32,717
-Let go of me.
-Later.

8
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:36,137
I'll tell you everything later.

9
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:38,389
Just let me go for now.

10
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:42,936
Since when have I become
a stranger to you?

11
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:48,608
Don't go.

12
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:51,736
Don't.

13
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:55,073
-I'm sorry.
-Don't go.

14
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:04,082
TARGET

15
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:06,918
ASSEMBLYMAN KIM SEUNG-CHEOL'S
MEMORIAL SERVICE

16
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,628
"As you silently embraced us

17
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,298
with your profound feelings of love

18
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,009
for a long time,

19
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:20,223
you had grown thin like a branch.

20
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,810
Please leave behind

21
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:26,980
all the troubling
and painful memories in this life.

22
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:31,359
Take only happy
and heartwarming memories."

23
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:37,532
-What's going on?
-Are you okay?

24
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:58,761
Step aside.

25
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,205
Sang-hun.

26
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:43,348
Have you gone mad?

27
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:46,267
You're saying that's Sang-hun's hand?

28
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,312
The ring...

29
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:52,607
There are countless rings
that look just like this.

30
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:55,568
How could you ruin the service
because of a mere ring?

31
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:58,571
She's right, Seo-hui.

32
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,241
I'm sure you're mistaken.

33
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:04,619
That can't be my son's hand.

34
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,043
Do you have the results?

35
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:15,672
Yes.

36
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:23,137
I think it is Jeong Sang-hun's hand.

37
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:28,518
That can't be.

38
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,061
Mom.

39
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:33,147
That's really my son's hand?

40
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,652
Doctor, are you sure
you ran the test properly?

41
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:38,903
Are you sure?

42
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,990
I'm sure there must be
something wrong with the test.

43
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:44,575
Doctor, let's run the test again.

44
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,869
Run the test properly again--

45
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:50,581
-Sir, please come with me.
-No.

46
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:02,760
Will she be okay?

47
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:04,429
It's quite gruesome.

48
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:08,975
Ms. Kim.

49
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:13,479
Please tell me.

50
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,150
Okay.

51
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:25,116
Looking at the cross-section, an ax
or a butcher's knife must've been used.

52
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,999
Seeing how the surface isn't smooth,
it was done by an amateur.

53
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,628
And this is the most important part.

54
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:40,340
I got the estimated time of amputation.

55
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,593
The hand isn't decomposed.

56
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:46,888
Seeing how the blood vessels on the hand
have expanded,

57
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:48,556
it's probably been one or two days.

58
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:53,019
And seeing how I only see
minor blood clots on the hand,

59
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,565
I think his hand was severed
when he was alive.

60
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:01,444
Is Sang-hun alive?

61
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:08,618
You're saying
that he could be alive, right?

62
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,958
I can't believe I'm in Songju.

63
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,628
Crap.

64
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,096
RELIABLE POLICE IN SONGJU

65
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:29,931
Are you in charge of this case?

66
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:32,725
-Is it related to Kim's case?
-Is it Jeong's hand?

67
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,435
-Could he be alive?
-Coming through.

68
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,937
-Move back!
-Is this a murder?

69
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:39,357
This afternoon,
during Assemblyman Kim's memorial service,

70
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,237
a severed hand of Jeong Sang-hun
was found in the middle of the square.

71
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:48,116
As the location of the incident
and the victim's residence are in Songju,

72
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,743
we've quickly set up
an investigation office here.

73
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:54,789
Of course, the Seoul Regional
Investigation Unit will be in charge,

74
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:58,960
but I would like to ask the officers here
for cooperation as well.

75
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:01,087
Before we came down here,

76
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,214
we were working on Kim's case.

77
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,634
As the nature of this recent case
is more urgent,

78
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:09,387
-other officers must take--
-We have to do both.

79
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:12,723
-What?
-We must investigate the cases together.

80
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,852
One of them died, and the other
vanished on the same day.

81
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:19,605
And the missing person's hand was found
at the memorial service of the deceased.

82
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:23,151
You can't separate the cases
even if you tried.

83
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:29,991
Okay. I will consider his suggestion, too.

84
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:31,826
Gosh.

85
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:37,790
Are you trying to undermine me
in front of the whole station?

86
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:40,251
-Are you upset?
-Beef brisket.

87
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:41,919
What the...

88
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:45,465
-Must I buy you beef for this?
-You annoying bastard.

89
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:52,805
Can I ride this?

90
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,226
Is this the only chair?

91
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:05,776
SONGJU

92
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:10,239
I don't get this guy Jeong Sang-hun.

93
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,575
His father owns JQ, you know.

94
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:17,246
The only son of Chairman Jeong Yeong-mun.

95
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:22,793
His father desperately tried
to hand off his enterprise to him.

96
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,963
He turned that down and lived abroad.

97
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:29,592
I heard that he went to Germany
to study photography.

98
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:33,846
Oh, my. What a free spirit.

99
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:36,682
And he came back to Korea
four months ago out of the blue

100
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:39,852
and became the new business' CEO.
What made him change his mind?

101
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:43,105
I don't know what caused it,
but that's when he changed.

102
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,234
After becoming the CEO,
he went against Kim.

103
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,985
And he and his wife separated.

104
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:50,071
What about his wife?

105
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,031
Anything suspicious?

106
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,548
What are you doing?

107
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:54,594
So you found the place.

108
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,471
I heard you asked where it happened.

109
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,976
To tell you the truth, I thought

110
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:05,062
Jeong Sang-hun was the culprit.

111
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:08,566
But things have gotten unclear now.

112
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:12,653
I wasn't the only one
who suspected him, was I?

113
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,408
Do you know

114
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,369
who harmed your father and your husband?

115
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:25,708
-How would I know that?
-It was you, Ms. Kim.

116
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:28,961
The last person to see Jeong.

117
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:34,300
You told me he went on a business trip,
but you tailed him that day.

118
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,554
What did you do
when you saw him that day?

119
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:43,100
Should I get a warrant
and investigate you?

120
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:44,727
Will you tell me then?

121
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:48,689
It's a private matter.

122
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,149
Pardon?

123
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,526
Your father passed away,

124
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:55,196
and you don't even know
if your husband is alive.

125
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,864
But what? "Private matter"?

126
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:58,449
Do you not want to find him?

127
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:02,161
Do you think this is a joke?

128
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:03,704
I followed him

129
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:08,417
to give him the divorce papers,
so I can get a divorce.

130
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:11,253
I came back after that. Satisfied?

131
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,195
Captain.

132
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:37,780
Captain!

133
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:38,864
What is it?

134
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,075
-What?
-Take a look at this.

135
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,244
What is it?

136
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:48,874
Pause.

137
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:53,337
Get the plate number of that motorcycle.

138
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:54,338
On it.

139
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:56,590
Zoom in.

140
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:00,845
Look at this bastard.

141
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:03,139
You know what I mean?

142
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:05,433
Hello.

143
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:07,476
I just had a question.

144
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,604
I have a package
that needs to be delivered quickly.

145
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,189
Who drives this motorcycle?

146
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:13,524
Why do you ask?

147
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,735
I heard this one is the fastest.

148
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:20,114
Chung-sik! Someone's looking for you.

149
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,827
Anyone can make the delivery.

150
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:26,328
What is it?

151
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,664
Let me ask you a question.

152
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,292
Did you deliver the box in the footage?

153
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:33,919
-Hey!
-You bastard!

154
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,131
Let me borrow this. I'll be quick.

155
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:38,507
-Who are you?
-I'll be quick.

156
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,634
You jerk!

157
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,181
Hey, move out of my way! Move!

158
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:46,891
You!

159
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,896
I really had no idea what was inside!

160
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:53,272
Why did you bolt, then?

161
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:56,233
Because you sounded scary.
I didn't do it. I'm serious.

162
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,154
I guess he found out
what was inside from the news.

163
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:03,115
He was scared shitless
in case he got framed for it.

164
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,702
But he said something was off.

165
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,871
He got a call and went to pick it up.

166
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,873
It was in the middle of nowhere.

167
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:15,294
He only found the money and the box
in a refrigerator.

168
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,591
The caller was a man,

169
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:22,635
but it turns out it was a burner phone.

170
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,098
What is this?

171
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,484
I have a bad feeling about this.

172
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,447
-Tae-sik.
-What?

173
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,491
-Come on!
-What?

174
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:48,285
Wear some overshoes before coming in.

175
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:49,703
Seriously?

176
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:52,498
You're such a stickler for the rules.

177
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,459
Why did you scrap the car that day
without telling me?

178
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:59,213
Come on, seriously?
You're talking about ancient times.

179
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:00,256
Find anything?

180
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:04,510
Right. No signs of forced entry.
I checked footages and fingerprints.

181
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:07,847
There's nothing strange.
He did leave voluntarily.

182
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,228
Didn't he study photography?

183
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:18,941
Did he stop his studies?
What's up with this photo?

184
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,652
Why? It's a nice photo.

185
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:39,169
-Did you check the desk?
-No, not yet.

186
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,005
Wow.

187
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:43,841
I guess it was worth cheating on his wife.
Look at her.

188
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:45,301
That's his wife.

189
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:48,554
Actually, I get why he got sick of her.

190
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:49,555
-Right?
-Yes, a bit.

191
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:54,727
What's that?

192
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,229
My goodness.

193
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,190
"I blended the tomatoes.

194
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:03,277
Drink this juice instead of coffee.
From Seo-hui."

195
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,822
-Seo-hui? That's his wife.
-That's right.

196
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:09,617
Gosh. They must have been happy together.

197
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,536
-I thought he had a mistress.
-I know, right?

198
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,204
This place is clean.

199
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:18,375
There's only one spoon and one toothbrush.
No traces of a woman at all.

200
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,631
She writes like a schoolgirl.

201
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:26,550
Yes.

202
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:33,557
I called you because he didn't check out
when his reservation ended.

203
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,229
-Did you call the police?
-As I told you, I called them.

204
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:47,613
I thought I probably shouldn't touch them,
so I left them as they are.

205
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,531
Okay. I'll take a look.

206
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:02,586
Hello.

207
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,255
You were here.

208
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,056
The beds are a mess.

209
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:16,850
Two cups. Two toothbrushes.

210
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:20,521
The traces of a woman are all here.

211
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:23,816
Are there cameras in the hall?

212
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:25,275
Yes.

213
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:32,282
There were two beds in the room.

214
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:33,993
He wasn't alone, was he?

215
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:36,120
Do you know whom he was with?

216
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:39,748
The room was just booked under his name.

217
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,250
How long has he been here?

218
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:47,589
He stayed here
from February 25 to March 2.

219
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:51,635
That's the day before he went missing.
He was here?

220
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:54,888
Let me check the surveillance footage
during his stay.

221
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,711
This belonged to Dad.

222
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:31,175
Was he with Dad?

223
00:17:57,326 --> 00:18:00,996
SECURED EVIDENCE
WITNESS?

224
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:05,793
We should check this first.

225
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,046
Let me know what you think.

226
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,131
Where are they located?

227
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:14,176
Pretty much all around this area.
And this.

228
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:18,472
If you look at this,
you can find some statistics here.

229
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:20,307
Please refer to these numbers.

230
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,310
What were they doing in here?

231
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,731
LOBBY

232
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:30,275
Jeong Sang-hun.

233
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:34,696
Goodness, nothing is happening.

234
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:36,907
That woman.

235
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:41,286
She's super hot.

236
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:46,583
Tae-sik, she went inside his room. See?

237
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:49,086
Come back here. That's not his room.

238
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:51,964
It's the room next to his.

239
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,056
Isn't that Kim Seung-cheol?

240
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:04,685
Did Jeong have an affair
with Kim?

241
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:07,104
You're losing it again.

242
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:11,066
If that's not it, what were they doing
in that room for a week?

243
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,735
Stop it.
Go up and get everything in the room.

244
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:15,529
Hurry.

245
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:21,410
Hey, don't forget to bring the papers
inside the shredder. Got it?

246
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:22,744
Got it.

247
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,665
Did anything unusual happen
during the time they stayed here?

248
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,085
They requested not to clean their room
during their stay.

249
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:33,297
Come to think of it, they never
requested for any staff, either.

250
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,592
They made sure no one went inside.

251
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:40,179
HALLWAY

252
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:44,850
JEON HO-GYU

253
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,144
What is it?

254
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:50,647
It was on the vehicle list
for illegal parking.

255
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,194
This doesn't make sense at all.

256
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:58,447
Why did Jeong come to such a rural area?

257
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:01,658
How can we open this?

258
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:05,370
Right. I should call the KCSI first.

259
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:07,581
What are your hands for?

260
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:19,760
GANGSIM LAW FIRM

261
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:27,017
CONSENSUAL DIVORCE INTENTION
CONFIRMATION DOCUMENT

262
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:30,103
She told the truth about one thing.

263
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:35,776
Detective Jo, this is what I found.

264
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:40,364
RECEIPT

265
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,245
MIRI-DONG, HUI-SUK

266
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,082
-Are we in Miri-dong?
-Yes.

267
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:51,750
"Miri-dong, Hui-suk."

268
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:53,669
Hui-suk?

269
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:57,005
There's a low chance that
it's a man's name, right?

270
00:20:58,465 --> 00:20:59,883
He came here to see a woman.

271
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:01,927
The rumor was true, after all.

272
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:05,973
I get it. They should meet at places
like this not to draw attention.

273
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:08,809
But why did he leave his car here?

274
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:11,770
I guess he couldn't go in with it.

275
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:21,238
Hello, ma'am.

276
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:25,117
Does a woman named Hui-suk
live in this neighborhood?

277
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:28,537
Ma'am.

278
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,163
"Hui-suk"?

279
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,456
Who is Hui-suk?

280
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,667
That's what I'm asking you.

281
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:42,092
Gosh. Oh, no.

282
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:44,469
Hello. May I ask a question?

283
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,346
Do you know someone named Hui-suk here?

284
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:47,973
-"Hui-suk"?
-Yes.

285
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:50,517
Jeong-ja's second daughter's name is...

286
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:51,852
Is that Hyang-suk?

287
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:53,228
-Hyang-suk.
-She was pretty.

288
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,896
Not Hyang-suk. Hui-suk.

289
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,857
Hyang-suk was really pretty.

290
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,235
Gosh, looks were all she had.
She never got good grades in school.

291
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,279
-But she was still pretty.
-That's true.

292
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:08,035
HUI-SUK'S TEAHOUSE

293
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,840
Why are you asking about him?

294
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:23,800
Do you remember him?

295
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:28,305
Jeez. Shouldn't you ask me questions
after buying a cup of tea or something?

296
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:31,058
You're trying to get stuff for free.

297
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:32,601
I'll have a blueberry yogurt.

298
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:34,311
I don't know what that is.

299
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:37,105
But I have good Shiquan Dabu tonics.

300
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:38,732
Okay.

301
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:40,567
Then,

302
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:43,028
we'll get two of those.

303
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,907
Two glasses of Shiquan Dabu tonics here!

304
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:47,824
Okay.

305
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,995
-Is he dead?
-Pardon?

306
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:56,208
It did look like something
was going to happen.

307
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,668
What did you say, you bastard?

308
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,212
-Say that again.
-What?

309
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:02,923
-This is your last chance.
-It was quite a scene.

310
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:04,633
I didn't like you from the get-go.

311
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:07,260
He talked back to the other guy.
He didn't back down.

312
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:08,762
I didn't know he had a temper.

313
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:09,930
Damn it.

314
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:15,268
After making a huge scene,
both of them left through the back door.

315
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:18,897
I just thought

316
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,900
that they were going
to finish their argument outside.

317
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:23,068
That's what I thought.

318
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:24,361
What did they fight about?

319
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:26,988
How would I know that?

320
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,701
Actually, I think I heard a certain name

321
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:33,537
-a couple of times.
-What name?

322
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,539
The man who just died...

323
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,124
Who was it?

324
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:39,835
-Kim Seung-cheol.
-That's right. It's him.

325
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:43,630
Don't you dare get cute with me.
Do you think this will solve things?

326
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,757
Don't underestimate me.

327
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:49,219
You go tell Kim Seung-cheol.
This won't change anything!

328
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,471
Damn it.

329
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,561
I think they were talking about him.

330
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:00,814
Did you see the guy whom he fought with?

331
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:06,153
Gosh, detective.
You’re asking too much of me.

332
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:08,989
All I could see was the back of his head.

333
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,159
I'll have another Shiquan Dabu tonic.

334
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:16,288
Sir, I really don't remember.

335
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:19,374
Get him another glass.

336
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,459
Yes, ma'am.

337
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:24,004
Seriously, I don't remember his face,

338
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:26,089
but...

339
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:28,258
His smell.

340
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,803
Right. I remember what he smelled like.

341
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:33,763
What smell?

342
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,766
Maybe you guys don't know what it is like.

343
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,519
It's like the smell
of construction workers.

344
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:45,609
It's a stinging and pungent smell.

345
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:51,615
Ma'am.

346
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:53,658
What?

347
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:56,203
Who is Hui-suk?

348
00:24:57,787 --> 00:24:59,039
Darn it.

349
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:04,377
Do you want to know?

350
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:11,343
This is where Jeong was last seen.

351
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:16,640
There are no security cameras around here.

352
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:19,267
Who did he meet here?

353
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,895
It's like the smell
of construction workers.

354
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:26,066
It's a stinging and pungent smell.

355
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:30,362
Is there a construction site
around here?

356
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,697
I didn't see any on my way here.

357
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,909
What about employment agencies
or construction companies?

358
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:37,410
There are tons.

359
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:40,747
Stinging and pungent?

360
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:48,046
SONGJU READY MIXED CONCRETE

361
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:54,844
Where are you going?

362
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:57,430
I think it's here.

363
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:09,484
WE WANT OUR WORKPLACE BACK

364
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,279
They are on strike.

365
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:22,289
SONGJU READY MIXED CONCRETE LABOR UNION

366
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,169
THE GOVERNMENT IS KILLING LABORERS

367
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:31,631
STOP MASS TERMINATION AND RESTRUCTURING

368
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:34,009
NO MORE MASS TERMINATION

369
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:52,944
"Labor union retreat"?

370
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:55,030
Kim Seung-cheol?

371
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,873
Dad helped them a lot

372
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:07,667
when the factory was built.

373
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:10,920
So I heard

374
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:15,634
the factory workers supported him.

375
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:20,513
-But recently...
-They must've turned away.

376
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:23,558
The factory was about to lose out
to the new business.

377
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:30,440
Is the man who tried to burn himself
in the picture?

378
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,944
-Is he one of them?
-It's possible.

379
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:37,656
You traitor!

380
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:39,407
Kim Seung-cheol!

381
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:43,286
You have to apologize, Kim Seung-cheol!

382
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:45,497
-Stop it.
-You traitor.

383
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:48,124
-Calm down.
-Kim Seung-cheol! Apologize!

384
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:51,878
-Calm down, sir.
-You have to apologize.

385
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:53,672
Put it out.

386
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:55,382
Kim Seung-cheol!

387
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:57,300
You have to apologize!

388
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,309
I'm sorry, but I don't know.

389
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:10,188
I didn't see his face.

390
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:13,525
It said Songju Ready Mixed Concrete
on his back.

391
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:16,361
I think this is the uniform.

392
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:17,946
I see.

393
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:20,782
I'll look into it.

394
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:23,410
Thank you, anyway.

395
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,584
Oh, right.

396
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:37,048
About your husband...

397
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:40,218
I didn't see any evidence of an affair.

398
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:44,055
At least not yet.

399
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:46,266
Detective Jo.

400
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:49,811
Please

401
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:52,856
find Sang-hun. I'm begging you.

402
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:57,152
Okay.

403
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,821
The guy who tried to burn himself.

404
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:01,990
His name is Kim Pil-yeon.

405
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,075
He's the union representative.

406
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,535
BUTCHER'S SHOP

407
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:07,829
But we can't get in touch with him.

408
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:11,666
I heard his wife runs
a butcher's shop in Songju.

409
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:13,376
Excuse me.

410
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:15,628
Is anyone in there?

411
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:21,092
FOR LEASE

412
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:23,553
Who are you?

413
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,434
I'm a cop.

414
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,936
Is your husband's name Kim Pil-yeon?

415
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:34,230
Wait inside.

416
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:44,616
We're moving out within this week.

417
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,827
We are looking for your husband.

418
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:49,496
Do you know where he is?

419
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:51,956
I haven't seen him for a week.

420
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:54,292
A week?

421
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:57,295
That's when Kim died
and Jeong went missing.

422
00:29:58,129 --> 00:29:59,047
But

423
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:01,007
you don't seem curious at all.

424
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:04,636
A cop is looking for your husband,
but you're not even asking why.

425
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:10,016
Ma'am, please tell me
if you know where--

426
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:12,143
Please tell him once you find him.

427
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,439
Tell him not to come here.

428
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,360
Even after his death.

429
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,159
Mom, I'm hungry.

430
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:29,911
Okay. Wait upstairs.

431
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:42,340
Looking at the cross-section, an ax
or a butcher's knife must've been used.

432
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:18,501
I don't eat with people
who bring boxed lunches.

433
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:20,587
You're so odd.

434
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:22,547
-Jin-gyeong.
-Yes?

435
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:23,506
-Are you busy?
-Huh?

436
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,884
If you're not busy,
unwrap the pickled radish.

437
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:26,843
Okay.

438
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,053
Ho-gyu, you're not busy, right?

439
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:30,471
So what?

440
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,724
Jeong Sang-hun and Kim Seung-cheol

441
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:35,727
seemed to be on good terms
with no discord.

442
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:39,564
So they were staying
at a hotel in Songju and doing something?

443
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:40,523
Right.

444
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:43,192
I don't want to imagine it at all.

445
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:44,777
Hey.

446
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,071
It's not like that.

447
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:50,199
I guess they were
just stuck in a hotel room

448
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:51,659
doing something together.

449
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:54,746
-Doing what?
-Ho-gyu, bring the paper.

450
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:56,247
One second.

451
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,000
Here.

452
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:00,752
What is this?

453
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:06,257
"Relocation of the Songju
renewable energy business site"?

454
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:07,759
You did a good job.

455
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:12,555
So it means Kim supported
the new business Jeong was working on.

456
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:16,225
So what does the new business have to do

457
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:18,144
with Kim Pil-yeon?

458
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:20,563
Gosh, I think you have

459
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:22,857
a poor understanding of human beings.

460
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:24,567
Look.

461
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:27,403
Who created jobs here
by building the factory?

462
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:29,405
It's Kim Seung-cheol.

463
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:33,034
To Kim Pil-yeon,
he wasn't just an assemblyman.

464
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:34,953
He was an idol.

465
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:37,372
An idol. A role model.

466
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:40,500
But things started to go wrong

467
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:41,584
because of a man.

468
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:44,462
Who do you think it is?
It's Jeong Sang-hun.

469
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:49,425
He announced he'd shut down the factory
and start the new business there.

470
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:54,055
And Kim Seung-cheol
whom they trusted took his side.

471
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:57,100
So Kim Pil-yeon flipped his lid
and went to see Kim Seung-cheol.

472
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:58,726
He set fire to himself

473
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:01,437
saying he'd kill himself,
but it didn't work.

474
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:04,983
If you watch Jeong Sang-hun carefully,

475
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:09,237
he's actually very handsome.
And he's rich.

476
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:13,616
That's when he got so jealous.

477
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,160
So he decided to destroy them.

478
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:18,705
-And he killed them all.
-Jin-gyeong!

479
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:24,335
-When does your story end?
-Let me explain again.

480
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:26,170
Kim and Jeong joined hands

481
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:29,173
to shut down the factory
and push forward with the new business.

482
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:32,593
That's why Kim Pil-yeon ended up
holding a grudge against them.

483
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,262
-I see.
-That's what I was saying.

484
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:36,305
Hey, it was completely different.

485
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:38,891
Gosh, that's mean.

486
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:43,646
I guess Jin-gyeong
is interested in literature.

487
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,064
It's a disease.

488
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,899
Hey, stop it.

489
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:49,569
You should hear me out.

490
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:50,611
TEST RESULTS

491
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,030
MATCH

492
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:53,865
Captain.

493
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,325
They found it.

494
00:33:56,617 --> 00:33:57,452
What?

495
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:00,455
Jeong Sang-hun's DNA.

496
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:02,832
It was found on one of the knives.

497
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:11,632
The police believe the labor union
representative of Songju RMC

498
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:14,469
is a suspect for the kidnapping of
Jeong Sang-hun of JQ Group

499
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:16,012
and put him on the wanted list.

500
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:18,056
We have Reporter Jeong Hyeon-cheol here.

501
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:21,934
The police found a knife
with CEO Jeong's bloodstain

502
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:24,479
at the butcher's shop run by Kim's wife.

503
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:26,230
The factory where Kim works at

504
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:28,649
is about to go out of business

505
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:31,110
due to the new renewable
energy business of JQ Group,

506
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:33,237
which may be the reason
for his alleged crime.

507
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:35,990
He was put on the wanted list
throughout the country.

508
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:38,659
And it shows
that Kim may have been involved in

509
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,411
Assemblyman Kim Seung-cheol's death.

510
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,413
The police are investigating this as well.

511
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:28,459
What's going on?

512
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:56,821
The guy

513
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:01,117
whom Sang-hun met last.

514
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:03,327
Did you find Kim Pil-yeon?

515
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:06,455
I'm sorry, sir.
We're looking for him everywhere.

516
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:09,750
What's taking you so long to find him?

517
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:14,797
The police are after him now.

518
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:17,008
We will find him soon.

519
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:18,176
I'm sorry, Mr. Jeong.

520
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:21,053
This all started because of you.

521
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,556
Bear that in mind.

522
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,350
If Sang-hun doesn't come back,

523
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:28,978
there will be no place

524
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:31,772
for you here.

525
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:33,399
Okay?

526
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:34,859
Get out.

527
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:56,797
SONGJU RMC, CEO CHOI CHI-DEUK

528
00:36:57,173 --> 00:37:00,092
Kim Pil-yeon?
I don't know very much about him.

529
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:02,637
He's the union representative, though.

530
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,972
That's why.
We're not exactly friends.

531
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,142
I'm not saying we were enemies, though.

532
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:11,812
We weren't on either
good terms or bad terms.

533
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:12,813
That's what I mean.

534
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:15,358
Do you have any idea where he'd be?

535
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:17,902
I don't know.

536
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:20,529
I think I heard he was seen at the casino.

537
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:22,114
But I don't know.

538
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:25,326
You should go ask the union members.

539
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:27,995
Please have some.

540
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,123
It's turmeric tea.
It's really good for your health.

541
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:37,088
-Hello.
-Darn it. Can anyone answer the phone?

542
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:40,841
Hey, you did a good job.

543
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,969
-Did you find out anything?
-No.

544
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:45,721
I checked all the security
footages in the neighborhood,

545
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:48,683
but Jeong Sang-hun just disappeared
since he left the teahouse.

546
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:50,601
It's like looking for a ghost.

547
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:52,144
Tae-sik, what about you?

548
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:53,437
Did you find anything?

549
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:56,649
The CEO and union members
didn't say much about Kim Pil-yeon.

550
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:59,485
Did we get any helpful reports?

551
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:01,570
Just several prank calls. Darn it.

552
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:04,156
His phone is turned off,
so we can't track him.

553
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:07,201
-Where is he hiding?
-You must've been surprised.

554
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:10,413
Who is speaking again?

555
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,624
-Hello.
-Jeongseon, Gangwon Province.

556
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:18,379
I don't know. I think I heard
he was seen at the casino.

557
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:20,339
-I'm listening.
-Jeongseon, Gangwon--

558
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:22,216
Hey, give me the phone.

559
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,218
-Did you see Kim Seung-cheol?
-Please hold.

560
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:26,053
Kim Seung-cheol is dead.

561
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:27,555
-Yes?
-Hello?

562
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:29,890
-Hello?
-What's the address?

563
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:00,796
Go away.

564
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:12,516
What are you doing here?
What's your name?

565
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:15,561
What's your name?

566
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:36,016
What the fuck!

567
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:42,523
Where is he?

568
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:45,443
I don't know. I have no idea--

569
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:55,202
Where is Jeong Sang-hun hiding?

570
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:57,037
I don't know, you fucker!

571
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:16,891
You won't tell me?

572
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:19,518
I don't know!

573
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:30,654
Fuck.

574
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:52,885
Hey.

575
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:56,305
Seo-hui.

576
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,390
Father.

577
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:07,525
Oh, dear. What were you doing?

578
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:12,154
You must be devastated.

579
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:15,366
I can't even imagine.

580
00:42:16,575 --> 00:42:19,703
Even I am having such a hard time.
You must be utterly distraught.

581
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:24,959
I saw the news.

582
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:27,711
Father.

583
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:33,384
How could someone do such a thing?

584
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:38,597
Just for a reason like that...

585
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:42,726
How could someone do that?

586
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:46,063
You get blinded by a single thing you lose

587
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:48,482
even if you have 100 things.
It's human nature.

588
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:51,193
But I understand.

589
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:56,115
Even I'm having such a hard time
believing it when I'm fully aware of that.

590
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:01,078
I'm sorry, Father.

591
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:05,374
Father, I'm sorry.

592
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:11,255
The day I last saw Sang-hun,

593
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:15,759
I was so mean to him.

594
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:21,765
What if I never see him again, Father?

595
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:24,685
No.

596
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:27,021
That won't happen.

597
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:29,064
I know

598
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:30,941
that Sang-hun will come back.

599
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:32,568
I'm sure of it.

600
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:41,201
I'm sure he'll come back,

601
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:42,995
so don't worry.

602
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:45,456
-All right?
-Okay.

603
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:11,482
Sang-hun.

604
00:44:17,863 --> 00:44:19,490
Hey, Sang-hun!

605
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:21,450
Sang-hun!

606
00:44:28,957 --> 00:44:30,167
You've gotten quite heavy.

607
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:32,795
Hey!

608
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:36,924
Where have you been?

609
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:38,801
Tell me!

610
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:41,053
I've been so anxious waiting for you.

611
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:43,597
Why didn't you answer your phone?

612
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:46,266
Why did you do this to me?
Where have you been?

613
00:44:47,309 --> 00:44:49,103
You're such a jerk.

614
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:54,483
-I'm sorry.
-I've been desperately waiting for you.

615
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:58,779
I missed you. I really missed you.

616
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:00,030
I missed you, too.

617
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:03,742
I missed you too, Sang-hun.

618
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:05,244
I missed you so much.

619
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:09,289
Let me see.

620
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:11,750
Are you all right?

621
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:14,837
Are you okay?

622
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:23,303
I'm so relieved.

623
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:25,347
I'm so glad you're back.

624
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:39,338
Sang-hun...

625
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:41,381
No!

626
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,685
Sang-hun...

627
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:54,686
No!

628
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:01,610
DO YOU WANT TO SAVE YOUR HUSBAND?

629
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:08,659
BECOME AN ASSEMBLYWOMAN IF YOU WANT
TO SAVE JEONG SANG-HUN'S LIFE

630
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:13,956
THAT IS THE ONLY WAY

631
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:19,294
IF YOU TELL ANYONE

632
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:20,963
JEONG SANG-HUN WILL DIE

633
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:26,718
What?

634
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:30,097
No...

635
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:31,723
No!

636
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:33,684
No!

637
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:37,855
What do I do?

638
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:40,732
No!

639
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:02,004
I told you to wait.
Didn't you see the poll results?

640
00:48:02,087 --> 00:48:04,715
No one even knows the candidate
you guys are endorsing.

641
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:07,676
For Songju, we need someone
from Kim's bloodline.

642
00:48:10,929 --> 00:48:12,347
-Is he inside?
-Yes.

643
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:14,558
-Wait!
-I have to go.

644
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:16,935
Sir, I'm going to do it. I will do it.

645
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:21,315
-What do I do first?
-I was actually waiting for you.

646
00:48:21,648 --> 00:48:25,235
I guess this is my lucky day,
Assemblywoman Kim.

647
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:27,863
Please help me, sir.

648
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:29,948
I'll do my best.

649
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:34,369
Look.
This is all that bastard's doing.

650
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:37,080
-Sir.
-Yes?

651
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:38,916
Are you sure it was this man?

652
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:42,169
How many times must you ask?
I told you that it's him.

653
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:45,380
I saw him running out of here
with my own two eyes.

654
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:47,132
Goodness.

655
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:50,594
All the doors were locked.

656
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:52,763
I wonder how he snuck in.

657
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:56,558
And why fight in someone else's building?

658
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:57,643
They fought?

659
00:48:57,768 --> 00:48:59,436
-What?
-Did you see it?

660
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:02,272
No, I didn't. But I heard it.

661
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:05,984
It sounded serious,
so I called the police.

662
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:09,196
And when I got back,
the whole place was already in this mess.

663
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:10,864
All right, let's think.

664
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:13,241
The day Jeong Sang-hun went missing,

665
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:16,578
Kim Pil-yeon fought with someone
in that abandoned building.

666
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:19,247
Who do you think that person was?

667
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:21,959
-Jeong Sang-hun.
-Right?

668
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:25,045
Kim Pil-yeon cut Jeong Sang-hun's hand off
in there.

669
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:27,714
Then he set the place on fire
to get rid of the evidence.

670
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:29,091
Doesn't it sound plausible?

671
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:30,467
Then where is Jeong?

672
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:34,930
-Wouldn't he be buried somewhere there?
-What? You think he's dead?

673
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:37,641
It's highly likely.

674
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:41,353
You don't have much
field experience, so you might not know.

675
00:49:41,603 --> 00:49:44,356
Victims are usually dismembered alive,
but they always die.

676
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:47,484
Then why did you talk
as if he's still alive at the briefing?

677
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:50,195
Hey, the whole nation was watching.
Was I supposed to say,

678
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:53,198
"He's probably dead by now,
but we'll find his corpse"?

679
00:49:53,281 --> 00:49:55,575
Jeong Yeong-mun is hounding us
to find his son.

680
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:57,661
Why invite trouble?

681
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:01,206
About the knife...

682
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:04,001
Why did he put it back there?

683
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:10,298
I'm talking about Kim Pil-yeon.
Why did he bring the knife back

684
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:12,759
to Songju
when he cut the hand off in Jeongseon?

685
00:50:13,301 --> 00:50:14,469
Don't you think it's odd?

686
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:20,350
Well, he probably has OCD.

687
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:23,562
Like Ho-gyu. He always
puts things back in their places.

688
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:24,730
No, I don't do that.

689
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:26,565
-You prick.
-What?

690
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:28,984
That woman. What's she doing there?

691
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:32,446
My fellow citizens of Songju

692
00:50:33,613 --> 00:50:36,908
and all the reporters that are here today.

693
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:40,412
Hello, I am Kim Seo-hui.

694
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:45,542
A while ago,

695
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:48,170
I suffered the most tragic event

696
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:50,756
I'll probably experience
throughout my entire life.

697
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:55,802
I had to unexpectedly say goodbye
to my father,

698
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:00,807
the person whom I loved
and respected the most.

699
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:06,063
However,

700
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:10,108
I'd like to set my sorrow aside
for the time being

701
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:14,738
because my father,
who devoted his entire life to Songju,

702
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:18,325
passed away before he could achieve
his longtime goal.

703
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:20,911
To honor his wishes,

704
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:24,414
I have decided to run
in the upcoming by-election.

705
00:51:26,374 --> 00:51:29,711
If you choose me,

706
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:31,713
I will lead our city, Songju,

707
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,925
with a warm and thoughtful heart.

708
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:39,513
-My father truly loved and cherished
-Sir.

709
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:41,890
-the people of Songju...
-Will it work?

710
00:51:41,973 --> 00:51:43,934
Mr. Hong has her back, you know.

711
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:46,186
We should do our best.

712
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:47,521
I, Kim Seo-hui,

713
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:50,065
will do my best.

714
00:51:50,982 --> 00:51:52,192
-Thank you.
-Well...

715
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:55,570
Some are speculating that
Assemblyman Kim's death was a homicide.

716
00:51:55,654 --> 00:51:57,322
-Is it true?
-You don't even know

717
00:51:57,405 --> 00:51:58,990
-if your husband is alive.
-Gosh.

718
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:02,077
-That woman is finally causing trouble.
-Has she lost her mind?

719
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,745
Her husband got his hand cut off.

720
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:05,705
She doesn't even know
if he's alive.

721
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:08,500
-She's going to do what?
-Did you know he was against it?

722
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:10,794
-Did JQ Group pressure you?
-We apologize.

723
00:52:14,714 --> 00:52:15,715
I...

724
00:52:16,758 --> 00:52:19,302
firmly believe that my husband

725
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,346
will come back.

726
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:25,851
Has she gone mad?

727
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:28,395
She looks like a different person.

728
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:31,815
She's using her father's death
to get a seat, isn't she?

729
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:34,734
She looks all innocent,

730
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:37,112
but she's obviously
brimming with ambition inside.

731
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:38,446
Right?

732
00:52:39,364 --> 00:52:40,907
Hey, where are you going?

733
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:44,870
That must've been nerve-racking.

734
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:48,373
I need to use the ladies' room.

735
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:49,457
Sure.

736
00:52:52,794 --> 00:52:54,129
It's okay.

737
00:52:54,212 --> 00:52:55,172
All right.

738
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:15,734
NO CALLER ID

739
00:53:17,402 --> 00:53:18,528
Hello?

740
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:23,241
Hello?

741
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:26,578
Hello? Who's this?

742
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:28,538
Hello?

743
00:53:28,955 --> 00:53:31,291
-Hello? Say--
-Do you want to find Jeong Sang-hun?

744
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:38,465
My gosh...

745
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:41,176
Yes, please don't kill him.

746
00:53:41,676 --> 00:53:43,345
Please spare his life.

747
00:53:44,095 --> 00:53:45,597
You're Kim Pil-yeon, right?

748
00:53:58,401 --> 00:53:59,736
KIM SEO-HUI

749
00:54:00,779 --> 00:54:02,739
Jeez, this woman...

750
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:07,786
Hello, this is Jo Tae-sik.

751
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:09,704
May I speak to Ms. Kim Seo-hui?

752
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:12,207
Well, she's...

753
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:14,501
She's not in there.

754
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:15,627
-Are you serious?
-Yes.

755
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:26,137
WITHDRAWAL DETECTED IN THE ACCOUNT

756
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:29,182
What? A withdrawal?

757
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:31,309
What is it? What now?

758
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:34,729
Detective Jo asked me to keep an eye on
Jeong's family's bank accounts,

759
00:54:34,854 --> 00:54:36,189
so I've been monitoring them.

760
00:54:36,564 --> 00:54:37,691
But some money was just

761
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:39,818
-withdrawn from Kim Seo-hui's account.
-What?

762
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:42,404
-How much?
-The amount is 50 million won.

763
00:54:42,487 --> 00:54:44,864
-What? 50 million won?
-What is going on?

764
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:47,117
Captain is saying
he's getting a bad feeling.

765
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:48,576
So Kim Seo-hui is gone,

766
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:51,162
-and money has been withdrawn.
-Come again?

767
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:54,291
Track her location at once

768
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:56,209
-and request for backup.
-Okay, will do.

769
00:55:57,395 --> 00:55:59,147
A blue shipping container.

770
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:01,775
LTCK...

771
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:04,486
LTCK.

772
00:56:05,236 --> 00:56:06,363
Sang-hun.

773
00:56:06,988 --> 00:56:09,324
I must find him.

774
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:11,910
Sang-hun.

775
00:56:24,964 --> 00:56:27,175
What is your problem?
Are you out of your mind?

776
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:29,469
Did you have a female customer from Seoul?

777
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:31,471
-Yes.
-Where is she now?

778
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:33,056
I dropped her off over there.

779
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:37,185
Sang-hun, where are you?

780
00:56:37,685 --> 00:56:38,937
Where are you, Sang-hun?

781
00:56:40,271 --> 00:56:42,899
LTCK...

782
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:49,197
Where is it?

783
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:53,993
Sang-hun.

784
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:57,497
A blue shipping container, LTCK.

785
00:56:57,747 --> 00:56:58,915
I must find it.

786
00:56:59,457 --> 00:57:02,710
"LTCK."
There it is.

787
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:25,233
Sang-hun?

788
00:57:27,735 --> 00:57:29,070
Sang-hun.

789
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:12,549
Why is everything
circling around Kim Seo-hui?

790
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,133
This is confusing me.

791
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:16,970
-Seo-hui, quit the campaign.
-The traitor's daughter

792
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:18,763
should give up the election!

793
00:59:18,846 --> 00:59:20,974
My fellow citizens of Songju.

794
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:24,769
-Stay strong, Ms. Kim.
-Start with people around Kim Pil-yeon.

795
00:59:24,852 --> 00:59:27,772
I heard the police are investigating
Mr. Choi at the moment.

796
00:59:27,855 --> 00:59:28,940
Why did you lie?

797
00:59:29,023 --> 00:59:31,734
Who's the bastard that's behind all this?

798
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:32,860
The exit poll...

799
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:35,113
Snap out of it and answer my question.

800
00:59:35,196 --> 00:59:36,781
What do I do now?

801
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:41,411
