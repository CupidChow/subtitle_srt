1
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,167
THIS DRAMA IS A WORK OF FICTION.
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,

2
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,878
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGIONS, AND INCIDENTS
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:58,266
Sir.

4
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:01,394
Sir.

5
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:09,944
Sir,

6
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:12,072
are you all right?

7
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,666
Jin Yeong-min just left
after meeting with the chairman.

8
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,460
Call the police and follow his car.

9
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:00,537
Sang-hun.

10
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:04,415
I don't even know how long it's been

11
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,001
since we last spent time together
like this.

12
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,589
I'm so happy that you're back.

13
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:14,509
I'm happy too, Dad.

14
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:15,885
By the way,

15
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,097
what's gotten into you?

16
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:24,227
You didn't even listen to me
when I told you to come back to Korea.

17
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,105
There's no special reason.

18
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,066
I figured

19
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,610
it was about time for me to come back.

20
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:35,363
By any chance,

21
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,825
is something wrong?

22
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:41,244
Well...

23
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,085
I wanted to come home
and be with the people I love.

24
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,214
I wanted to see them as often as I could

25
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:55,800
and thought it'd be nice

26
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,596
to return the love I've received.

27
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:04,559
Before it's too late.

28
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:54,150
You should get going now.

29
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,994
Have you decided where you're going?

30
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:07,914
The groundbreaking ceremony.

31
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:09,999
Please get in.

32
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,718
You made a wise decision.

33
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:25,098
Things would've been easier for both of us
had you been like this from the beginning.

34
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:29,477
We're ready, Assemblywoman Kim.

35
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,860
Do you plan to expose the agreement
during the annual audit?

36
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:41,739
No, they even managed
to mess up the press conference.

37
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,951
They'll obviously influence
the audit as well.

38
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:48,454
But this time,
we'll actually use it to our advantage.

39
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,291
-What do you mean?
-Father and JQ

40
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,377
will probably attend
the groundbreaking ceremony as planned.

41
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,045
That's when we'll make our move.

42
00:04:57,338 --> 00:05:00,883
The agreement will be given out to
all the reporters, assemblymen and women,

43
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:04,345
and residents of Songju
who will be at the ceremony.

44
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,265
That way, everyone there
will be a witness.

45
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,185
Then they won't be able to stop us

46
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,104
unless they kill all of them.

47
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:15,315
Even my father-in-law

48
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:18,151
won't be able to stop us this time.

49
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,579
Where does this road lead?

50
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,874
I've checked,
and it leads to Buheung-myeon.

51
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,501
Buheung-myeon?

52
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,839
BUHEUNG-MYEON, YEONGIL-MYEON, HAGYE-MYEON

53
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:41,841
"Yeongwon Children's Home"?

54
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,303
Isn't this where Jeong Sang-hun
and Jin Yeong-min grew up?

55
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,555
Yes, it is.

56
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:57,899
Hello, was Jin Yeong-min here
by any chance?

57
00:05:57,982 --> 00:05:58,858
Pardon?

58
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,152
No, why would Yeong-min...

59
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:04,072
Then is there a shed
or an empty building around here

60
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:06,282
that people don't use?

61
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:07,992
GROUNDBREAKING CEREMONY

62
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,744
It has already been

63
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:13,414
almost 30 years
since I first founded Jeonggeon Steelwork

64
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:15,958
here in Songju.

65
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,044
Since that day,

66
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,546
I have been single-mindedly running

67
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:25,093
toward the goal of making
the small city, Songju,

68
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:27,762
one of the best cities in the country.

69
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,848
Starting with
this groundbreaking ceremony,

70
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:34,185
Songju will be the center of

71
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:38,314
all renewable energy businesses
in the future.

72
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:42,777
I'd like to ask everyone here

73
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:47,156
to show us their support
and join us in taking

74
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,784
the meaningful first step.

75
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,664
NEW ENERGY BUSINESS COMPLEX
GROUNDBREAKING CEREMONY

76
00:06:56,165 --> 00:07:00,628
Now, we will unveil
the scale model of the business complex.

77
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:03,714
Please proceed to the podium.

78
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,594
You should go too, Assemblywoman Kim.

79
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:09,679
No, I'm fine.

80
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,352
ALL CONTACTS

81
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,104
CHOOSE CONTACTS

82
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:26,863
Now, we will all get to see
the scale model of the business complex.

83
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,407
Three,

84
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:30,908
two,

85
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,453
one.

86
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:47,925
What's going on?

87
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:53,973
THOSE WHO WERE SILENT
THOSE WHO WERE NOT

88
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,243
-You two, go that way.
-Yes, sir.

89
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,093
-What is that?
-My gosh!

90
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,721
-What's that?
-What the heck?

91
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:37,475
-What on earth is that?
-What's going on?

92
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:40,811
-My gosh!
-This is terrible.

93
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:44,565
-Is this...
-How can this be?

94
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,569
-Search the place.
-Yes, sir.

95
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:56,494
Jeong Sang-hun...

96
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:14,011
-Goodness!
-This is so terrible.

97
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,471
-I can't believe this.
-Let's go.

98
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,723
-Hey, take photos.
-Gosh, let's get out of here.

99
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,350
I can't believe this!

100
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:21,310
-My gosh!
-This is crazy.

101
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,729
-Gosh!
-Take photos.

102
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:30,111
-My goodness.
-How...

103
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:31,028
Hurry.

104
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:21,621
How...

105
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,263
-What is happening?
-What's going on?

106
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:40,890
-Gosh, what is that?
-What is it?

107
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:43,684
-Shit!
-No. This can't be.

108
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,686
Don't come near me!

109
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,521
Don't come anywhere near me.

110
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,900
Don't you dare touch me.

111
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:55,029
You have no right.

112
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:56,697
Look! It must be Jeong Sang-hun's.

113
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:01,994
Sir.

114
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,086
Gosh! It's a heart!

115
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,046
I can't believe
someone put a heart in there.

116
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:15,508
-This is crazy.
-God.

117
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,844
My gosh, what is going on?

118
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:20,805
What is happening?

119
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,266
First, let's preserve the scene.

120
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,685
And call Forensics right away.

121
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:30,815
Detectives, please continue
to search the site.

122
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,617
JIN YEONG-MIN

123
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,288
Did you find Sang-hun?

124
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:47,957
You.

125
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,294
Now, you need to find me.

126
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,611
The view is actually better
than I expected.

127
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,325
Should I be glad?

128
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,628
After Su-hyeon died,

129
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:37,965
I could deal with most things.

130
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,596
But I couldn't bring myself to come here.

131
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:47,183
She must've been terrified.

132
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:51,770
And it must've been so painful.

133
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:55,566
Why did you do that?

134
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,694
She didn't do anything wrong.

135
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:01,071
Yes, she did.

136
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,868
She put Chairman Jeong in a tight spot.

137
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:12,833
Jin Yeong-min, that bastard.

138
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:15,169
What the heck is he thinking?

139
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:18,589
Do you know why we feel uneasy
around each other?

140
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,177
I used to be like you.

141
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:26,055
I wanted to be acknowledged.

142
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,641
I wanted to be esteemed.

143
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,519
I wanted to be chosen.

144
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:36,398
I felt as if that was
my only goal in life.

145
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,984
Back then, I thought that was everything.

146
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:43,697
But taking just one step back

147
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,617
made everything clear.

148
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,329
It was all so useless.

149
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,334
I know why you went
to such extreme lengths.

150
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:58,921
I know why you had to kill Su-hyeon

151
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,591
as well as Assemblyman Kim Seung-cheol.

152
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:10,307
You wanted Chairman Jeong to notice you.

153
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,728
You wanted him to need you.

154
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,398
But you know what?

155
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:20,818
Do you think he finds you worthy?
Do you think you mean

156
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:24,196
anything to him?

157
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,450
Probably not.

158
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,246
Look.

159
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,749
Whom did you commit all those crimes for?

160
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,295
And who's in jail now?

161
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,423
What are you trying to say?

162
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:46,010
I always feel bad for you

163
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,389
because I used to be just like you.

164
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:52,766
Enough.

165
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:01,752
In Dong-gu!

166
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:03,253
-Hey!
-Drop the knife!

167
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:04,421
Don't move!

168
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:06,674
Stay still!

169
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,094
Ambulance. Call the ambulance now!

170
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:12,054
-Yes, sir.
-Stay still.

171
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,306
In Dong-gu.

172
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:16,058
If you get locked up this time,

173
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,811
you won't get out until the day you die,
you bastard.

174
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:19,937
-Take him!
-Okay.

175
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,071
What the hell?

176
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,282
This was my choice.

177
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:38,163
I don't want any more regrets.

178
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:44,044
Hey, Jin Yeong-min.

179
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:46,588
Jin Yeong-min! Hey!

180
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:15,826
Excuse me.

181
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,458
Here.

182
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,337
I found this in his pocket.

183
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,699
TO SEO-HUI

184
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:26,688
Seo-hui.

185
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:29,900
If you're reading this letter,

186
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:34,530
it probably means you now know
what I was trying to do.

187
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:36,698
It also means

188
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:40,661
that I'm dead.

189
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:45,165
It would've been so nice if I'd been able
to tell you everything

190
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:47,084
from the beginning.

191
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:49,461
But all my life,

192
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:52,714
I learned to hide myself,

193
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,299
so I still

194
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,094
don't really know where and how

195
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,513
I should begin the story.

196
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,308
I decided to come back to Korea

197
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,561
because I wanted to spend

198
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:09,523
the time that I had left
with you and my father.

199
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,282
That was also why I returned
to the company,

200
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,492
which I hated so much.

201
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,414
Mr. Jeong.

202
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:31,211
But after the reporter, Choe Su-hyeon,
came to see me,

203
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:33,630
everything changed.

204
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:39,261
One day, a completely innocent person

205
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,804
was found dead

206
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:43,515
just because she knew the truth

207
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:45,767
and tried to reveal it.

208
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:51,273
Does my father know
that you killed Choe Su-hyeon?

209
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:53,817
I have never done anything

210
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,321
Chairman Jeong didn't approve.

211
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:00,073
What?

212
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,119
If you don't stop,

213
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:09,499
those who help you
will get hurt in your place.

214
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,753
Don't forget

215
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:16,006
that others will be hurt because of you.

216
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,510
That was when I realized something.

217
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:24,765
Dad, you know everything.

218
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:29,394
You know how many people
lost their lives because of JQ.

219
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:32,022
Why won't you admit your fault? Why not?

220
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:34,733
"Fault"?

221
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:40,280
I didn't do anything wrong.

222
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:46,453
Don't worry, Sang-hun.

223
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:50,707
No one can dare lay a finger on us.

224
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:58,507
-I won't
-I finally learned what kind of person

225
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,425
-let it happen.
-my father is,

226
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:04,429
what kind of life he's led,

227
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:06,390
and

228
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,726
how powerless I am

229
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,146
in front of him.

230
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,726
But after your father passed away,

231
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:53,228
I had to muster up
all my remaining courage.

232
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,023
If even I remained silent,

233
00:21:57,899 --> 00:21:59,484
it'd be so unfair...

234
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:02,070
Yeong-min.

235
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,739
...for all the innocent victims.

236
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,116
Help me, please.

237
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:10,829
If I could, I'd really love

238
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,165
to turn everything back.

239
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:18,128
Had I never sided
with Chairman Jeong in the first place...

240
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,673
-Yeong-min.
-How can we stop them?

241
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:24,801
What can we do to stop them now?

242
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:27,804
That was when I thought

243
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:33,393
of the only way to stop my father.
I thought of you as well.

244
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:37,689
My father won't stop.

245
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:41,234
Now that my father-in-law is dead,

246
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:46,490
he'll need a new face to pass the bill
and launch the new business.

247
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:50,577
He'll probably

248
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,748
try to use Seo-hui.

249
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,918
And she'll end up helping him

250
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,545
without knowing anything.

251
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,299
I can't let that happen.

252
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:06,343
So you want to tell Seo-hui?

253
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:08,136
No, you mustn't tell her anything.

254
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,264
It'll only put her in danger.

255
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,643
We can never stop my father

256
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:17,521
with the things that I've tried so far.

257
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:21,441
More people will die.

258
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,362
Except for me.

259
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:30,408
We need to do something

260
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:33,703
that my father and Mr. In

261
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,084
can't even imagine.

262
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:43,505
Something that can get
the world's attention.

263
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:48,426
Someone who can help Seo-hui
get closer to the truth.

264
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:52,848
The only person my father will never

265
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:55,433
want to lose.

266
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:00,605
We must use that person.

267
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:03,567
Who is that?

268
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:08,530
Jeong Sang-hun.

269
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:11,658
Sang-hun.

270
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:24,129
OPEN FOLDER

271
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:43,899
No...

272
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:45,901
Yeong-min.

273
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:49,988
It's okay.

274
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:56,912
I don't want to die

275
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:00,373
without accomplishing anything.

276
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,669
I want to do something.

277
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:07,505
You know what I mean.

278
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:32,530
I made Kim Pil-yeon a suspect at first

279
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:37,160
because he also kept his silence
knowing the whole thing.

280
00:25:39,537 --> 00:25:41,039
If he was spotted as the culprit,

281
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:44,626
I thought he would tell you
and the police the truth.

282
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:53,218
And I did the same thing to Choi Chi-deuk
who only tried to make money

283
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:55,178
using the whole thing
when he knew the truth.

284
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:58,848
I thought they all were accomplices.

285
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:07,065
But after they were killed
by Dad and Mr. In,

286
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:09,526
I had no other choices.

287
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:15,865
Even after Choe Su-hyeon was revealed,
Dad still tried to cover it up.

288
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:19,286
And he even tried
to make you the scapegoat.

289
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:29,671
We had only one choice left.

290
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:57,866
I can't do this.

291
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,838
I know how cruel it was to you

292
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:58,343
and how selfish it was of me.

293
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:07,977
But, Seo-hui...

294
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,529
It had to be you.

295
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:22,283
I really wanted you to do this.

296
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:24,786
Because

297
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,706
the whole thing
started with our dads' wrongdoings.

298
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:00,530
I'm sorry.

299
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:02,490
I'm really sorry.

300
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,285
I'm sorry, Sang-hun.

301
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,415
I'm so sorry.

302
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:19,048
I'm sorry. It must've hurt so much.

303
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,218
Please come back.

304
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:24,429
Come back to me, Sang-hun.

305
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:03,802
Sir, there are
a lot of reporters camping outside.

306
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,805
I don't think we can
control the press reports.

307
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:10,433
After the agreement is revealed,
the shareholders are reeling.

308
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:11,935
What should we do?

309
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:14,729
-No.
-Pardon?

310
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,065
No.

311
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:21,486
My son wouldn't do such a thing.

312
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,866
Sang-hun would never...

313
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:34,332
Did you

314
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:36,709
do the whole thing on purpose?

315
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:40,880
Did you not even want to live
in the first place?

316
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:49,222
Did you want to stop the business
that badly?

317
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:10,827
Detective Jo.

318
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,621
You did as much as you could.

319
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:18,418
I know you were done

320
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:21,921
with the life here already.

321
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:25,133
But it felt like the old times
when we were working on this case.

322
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:29,846
You weren't afraid of anything.

323
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:33,933
Is that what you think?

324
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:39,647
But I couldn't find him
until things had gone this far,

325
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:42,859
even though I tried to do my best.

326
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:49,657
We can't find out what he was thinking
right before he died

327
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:52,452
with an autopsy, can we?

328
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:56,956
I mean...

329
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:00,668
I'm just curious.

330
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,839
What could those two

331
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,175
have been thinking of?

332
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:10,720
The man named Jeong Sang-hun
must've been in a lot of pain.

333
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:13,806
Given what he went through,
I can tell how painful it was.

334
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:15,642
Brain tumor.

335
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,145
It had grown a lot.

336
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:22,857
He wouldn't have lasted for long anyway.

337
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:26,194
And I'm pretty sure
he knew about his condition.

338
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:36,120
He even used the euthanasia drug.

339
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:39,415
There was no way you could stop him.

340
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:46,673
Tae-sik.

341
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:50,343
Don't beat yourself up.

342
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:52,178
Okay?

343
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:12,240
But still...

344
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,499
It must've been hard.

345
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:25,837
For you.

346
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:29,924
The disappearance case
of CEO Jeong Sang-hun of JQ Group

347
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,968
that caused quite a stir
across the country

348
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:33,761
finally came to an end

349
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,805
yesterday afternoon after three months.

350
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:39,183
Jeong was found dead
in a deserted building

351
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:41,060
located in Yeongil-myeon, Songju,

352
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:42,895
and his body had been mutilated

353
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:45,606
when it was discovered.

354
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:49,652
According to the report,
the criminal who murdered Jeong

355
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:52,655
is Jin, who became the new CEO
of Songju JQ after Jeong's disappearance.

356
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:54,741
He allegedly committed

357
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:57,618
the crime due to personal grudges.

358
00:33:58,077 --> 00:34:03,291
JQ Group hasn't yet made
any official announcement about this case.

359
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:09,756
According to the agreement, your father,
the late Assemblyman Kim Seung-cheol

360
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,508
was involved in the contamination case
of Jeonggeon Steelwork.

361
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:15,595
Were you not afraid
to reveal the agreement?

362
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:19,307
Before my father passed away,

363
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:23,770
he was going to confess his crime.

364
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:25,980
And...

365
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:30,068
I also realized something
going through this incident.

366
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:33,863
I realized that it's wrong to reveal

367
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:38,785
only parts of the truth
that will benefit you.

368
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:40,078
It's no different

369
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:43,081
from telling a lie.

370
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:46,209
Too many people have become

371
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,628
victims of such lies.

372
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:52,173
I believe that

373
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:54,675
revealing the truth

374
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,887
is a way to repent
of my father's wrongdoing.

375
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:01,099
Your husband was recently found dead.

376
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:03,226
Apparently, the criminal
was the CEO of Songju JQ

377
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:05,436
and the best friend of your husband.

378
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:09,482
Why do you think he committed those crimes
and harmed your husband?

379
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:12,193
CEO Jin also tried

380
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:15,363
to correct all the mistakes.

381
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:17,573
And...

382
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:21,452
my husband

383
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:24,580
asked him to do it.

384
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:27,959
-What's she talking about?
-He asked him to do it?

385
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:31,337
-I don't understand.
-What does she mean?

386
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,506
The criminal who murdered my husband

387
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:36,509
was CEO Jin Yeong-min.

388
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,010
But it was also

389
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:40,471
my husband, Jeong Sang-hun, himself.

390
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:43,683
-What do you mean?
-What makes you say such a thing?

391
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:47,395
-Can you tell us more details?
-Do you mean he killed himself?

392
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:50,439
-How is it even possible?
-Please answer it.

393
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:52,024
JQ is a company of murderers

394
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:53,776
and it must be punished.

395
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:57,363
-It must be punished.
-My husband believed

396
00:35:57,446 --> 00:36:01,075
that he should reveal JQ's brutality
and accuse those who tried to cover it up.

397
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,953
And he thought
he had to sacrifice himself

398
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:08,207
for those who suffered
from the contamination.

399
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:10,543
Have the car ready.

400
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:11,878
Assemblyman Hong.

401
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:14,338
We'd like you to go
to the police station with us.

402
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:15,923
Where am I going?

403
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:17,383
Do you know who I am?

404
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:18,384
I know it well.

405
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:21,387
Mr. Hong Min-guk,
I'd like you to go voluntarily

406
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,805
to the police station

407
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:25,766
on the charge of accepting bribes
and sexual advances from JQ.

408
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:28,644
How dare you...

409
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:31,606
If you don't want to,
I can interrogate you here.

410
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:32,732
It doesn't matter to me.

411
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:34,317
Are you okay with that?

412
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:43,367
NAM SU-MI

413
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:44,827
Ms. Nam Su-mi.

414
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:48,164
You are under arrest
for dereliction of duty.

415
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,709
Get your hand off the mouse and come here.

416
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:53,586
Go and handcuff her.

417
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:57,089
Handcuff her.

418
00:36:58,257 --> 00:37:00,176
-You might get hurt.
-Let go of me.

419
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:03,971
You have the right to talk to an attorney
and defend yourself.

420
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:08,142
You can also ask for habeas corpus
and remain silent.

421
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,435
I clearly told you.

422
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:10,394
Take her.

423
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,313
Take all the stuff in here.

424
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:13,439
-Okay.
-Shoot.

425
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:21,197
Chairman Jeong.

426
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:25,201
You're under suspicion of offering bribes.
You should come to the police station.

427
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:28,996
Let's go.

428
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:35,711
Mr. Kim, you don't have to come.

429
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:39,257
Call my attorney, Mr. Choe.

430
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:45,638
We've had enough of this, right?

431
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:48,057
Facing each other in here like this.

432
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:49,934
But,

433
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:52,853
you're not getting out this time.

434
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:56,691
I can fill this place with people

435
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:59,944
who saw you killing Jin Yeong-min.

436
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:01,362
He...

437
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:03,114
enticed me.

438
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:05,116
Whether he enticed you or not,

439
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:09,412
the fact that you killed him
doesn't change.

440
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:12,123
And now you know

441
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:14,667
why Jin Yeong-min did all that.

442
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:16,544
You know what?

443
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:19,714
Jin Yeong-min and you are quite similar.

444
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:22,258
Though his last choice

445
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:24,844
was totally different from yours.

446
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:28,889
So...

447
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:33,436
are you not going to admit
that Chairman Jeong was involved?

448
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:39,650
Chairman Jeong

449
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,445
has nothing to do with this.

450
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:45,197
You're unbelievable.

451
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,577
That's impressive.

452
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:55,499
You never change.

453
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,169
It's like

454
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:01,547
a long crush on someone

455
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:03,799
has turned into your belief.

456
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:07,219
I guess you don't know

457
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:10,222
how to live your life in a different way.

458
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:16,854
It's not my business
how you live your life.

459
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:19,940
But what about your father?

460
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:21,984
Will you leave him there?

461
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:25,196
You'll end up in jail anyway.

462
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,906
Now that it's happening,

463
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:29,992
it might be better

464
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:34,330
not to do anything you'd regret.

465
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:39,377
Are you saying

466
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,837
the agreement is fabricated

467
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,507
and Jeong Sang-hun didn't kill himself,

468
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,467
but murdered by Jin Yeong-min?

469
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,886
Is this your claim?

470
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:52,223
No matter how many times you ask,
my answer won't change.

471
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,849
That's enough

472
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:56,519
of the tiring squabbling.

473
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:58,312
I came all the way here

474
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:01,107
to talk to you when you don't
even have an arrest warrant.

475
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,441
I believe

476
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:05,152
I did all I could do.

477
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:09,907
CEO Nam Su-mi of Bareun News
and Assemblyman Hong Min-guk.

478
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:13,160
They've already admitted
the charge of accepting bribes

479
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:14,829
from you.

480
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:18,374
We found the borrowed name bank account
and circumstantial evidence for bribery.

481
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:23,003
I guess you guys weren't very loyal
to each other.

482
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:27,591
Apparently they are already seeking
for a way of escape.

483
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:29,969
It's just their claims.

484
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,929
False statements can't be
used as evidence--

485
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:33,305
I already know that.

486
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:37,476
So?

487
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,979
Are you not going to admit the charge?

488
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,149
"I'm sorry. It's all my fault."

489
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:45,609
How hard is it to say such a thing?

490
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,319
Remaining silent

491
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:49,280
doesn't make what you did go away.

492
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:53,659
That's why your son ended up like that,
so now you should...

493
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:54,785
Hey.

494
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,203
Shut your mouth.

495
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:58,831
Don't say

496
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:02,376
a word about my son.

497
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,380
Time's up.

498
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:09,925
He answered your questions
as best as he could.

499
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:12,887
You don't have the legal rights
to keep him here.

500
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,555
We should get going now.

501
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:16,807
Chairman Jeong, let's go.

502
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,651
That's too bad.

503
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:30,946
-I'm afraid you can't leave.
-What do you mean?

504
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:32,823
The arrest warrant

505
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:34,492
has just been issued.

506
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:39,121
Please have a seat.

507
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:42,541
Mr. Jeong Yeong-mun.

508
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:46,045
Sit.

509
00:41:55,971 --> 00:41:57,389
Let's get started.

510
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:02,603
I have never dealt with such awful people
in my life before.

511
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:06,148
You know what?
In Dong-gu at least admitted

512
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:08,359
to the crimes
his father took the blame for.

513
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:10,444
But look what Jeong Yeong-min said.

514
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:12,029
His own son

515
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:14,990
came up with this dreadful plan
because of what he did

516
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:16,909
and even sacrificed his life.

517
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:19,453
He said it was Jin Yeong-min's doing
and he was being framed.

518
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:21,747
How could a human being say such a thing?

519
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:24,833
To that bastard, apologizing is harder

520
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:27,711
than killing someone.

521
00:42:28,337 --> 00:42:30,130
That's how he lived his whole life.

522
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:32,633
He thinks the world will collapse

523
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:34,385
the moment he admits his mistakes.

524
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:37,179
He doesn't know that it already collapsed.

525
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:43,519
Ms. Kim.

526
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:47,523
I would like to talk to my father-in-law.

527
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:53,028
There is...

528
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:55,573
There's no way
my son would do such a thing to me.

529
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:57,700
Yeong-min planned everything.

530
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:00,452
It's all Yeong-min's doing!

531
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:03,497
Father, I knew

532
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:06,917
you wouldn't accept the truth.

533
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:16,552
Read it.
Sang-hun wrote the letter himself.

534
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:42,995
Do you still refuse to accept it?

535
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:47,416
Sang-hun started all of this

536
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:49,877
only to stop you, Father.

537
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,003
No.

538
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:53,714
-No.
-He tried everything,

539
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:55,299
but he still couldn't stop you.

540
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:57,718
Because he couldn't stop you,

541
00:43:57,801 --> 00:44:00,220
he thought
he must tell the world the truth

542
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:04,224
even if it meant he had to sacrifice
the remainder of his life.

543
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:07,728
Here's what I think, Father.

544
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:10,105
Regardless of your relationship
with Sang-hun,

545
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:12,024
I believe

546
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:14,818
that Sang-hun truly loved you.

547
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:18,072
That's why he just couldn't let you walk

548
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:20,866
on the wrong path
or see people die because of it.

549
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:23,535
No one

550
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:26,789
would go this far
for someone they don't even love.

551
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:30,250
What about you, Father?

552
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:32,961
Did you love Sang-hun?

553
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:35,005
Of course.

554
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:36,674
Do you mean it?

555
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:38,759
Are you sure you loved him?

556
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:44,682
Father, if you loved Sang-hun as your son

557
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:47,393
even for a moment,

558
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,231
and if you can understand
what Sang-hun had gone through,

559
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:54,900
you should answer his wish.

560
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:59,029
You have already hurt him enough as it is.

561
00:45:00,322 --> 00:45:01,990
Do you want his death

562
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:04,660
to be a waste, too?

563
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:10,416
Will you abandon him

564
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:13,710
even in his death?

565
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:37,503
The lieutenant in charge of the case
will explain

566
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:40,547
the result of the investigation
in detail now.

567
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:54,436
Hello. I'm the lieutenant in charge
of the case. My name is Jo Tae-sik.

568
00:46:55,729 --> 00:46:59,775
We obtained the videotapes Jeong Sang-hun
had filmed when he was alive.

569
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:02,778
We have found out that this case
was not executed by Jin alone

570
00:47:02,861 --> 00:47:07,824
and that it was a planned crime
Jeong Sang-hun was also part of.

571
00:47:08,825 --> 00:47:10,369
At the end of our investigation,

572
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:13,205
we found out that
these two individuals planned the act

573
00:47:13,288 --> 00:47:16,625
in order to expose the corruption
of Jeonggeon Steelwork.

574
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:19,878
-Please say something to the people.
-Mr. Hong. Please answer our questions.

575
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:23,799
-Are the accusations all true?
-How much money have you received?

576
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:25,842
-How do you feel right now?
-Mr. Hong.

577
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:28,554
As of now, we are investigating

578
00:47:28,887 --> 00:47:30,138
and summoning

579
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:32,558
every politician and businessman related

580
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:34,309
to the contamination in Songju.

581
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:37,062
-Please answer our questions.
-You'll hurt yourself. Be careful.

582
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:38,021
Through this case,

583
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:41,066
we had to repent of our ineffective
protocol for initial investigations.

584
00:47:41,149 --> 00:47:43,735
We also discovered corrupt relationships
between police officers

585
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:45,988
-and those who wield political power.
-Mr. In Dong-gu.

586
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:49,116
We also had to bear
the pain of countless sacrifices

587
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:50,576
which stemmed from these.

588
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:53,620
Some of the sacrifices
belong to innocent people

589
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:55,080
who were devastatingly hurt.

590
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:58,292
Among them, there was a death

591
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:02,296
of a young detective
who had just begun his career.

592
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:05,090
We, the police,
will reflect on our actions

593
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:07,593
so that a tragedy like this
never happens again.

594
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:12,180
And we will do our best to dedicate
our lives to bringing justice.

595
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:26,278
LATE JIN YEONG-MIN

596
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:49,885
I...

597
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:54,723
don't understand it yet.

598
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:59,519
I don't get how we ended up here.

599
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:08,362
But I know one thing for sure.

600
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:13,909
That the decision you made suits you.

601
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:16,912
YEONGWON CHILDREN'S HOME

602
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:18,246
Yeong-min.

603
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:23,418
Jin Yeong-min.

604
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:32,052
Rest in peace now.

605
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:38,600
Just be yourself.

606
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:43,271
And rest.

607
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:46,400
JEON HO-GYU

608
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:51,988
Ho-gyu.

609
00:49:54,574 --> 00:49:55,951
How are you?

610
00:49:57,035 --> 00:49:58,286
We...

611
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:00,580
caught the culprits.

612
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:03,834
People who hurt you like this...

613
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:07,546
We caught all of them.

614
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:11,591
Had we caught them a bit sooner,

615
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:14,302
you could have stayed with us.

616
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:18,682
You got promoted.

617
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:22,728
Goodness.

618
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:26,440
You punk. Aren't you a big shot now?

619
00:50:28,734 --> 00:50:31,653
Things could have been awkward
between us with your promotion.

620
00:50:33,655 --> 00:50:35,115
I just dropped by.

621
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:36,992
Congratulations.

622
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:39,077
Sergeant Jeon Ho-gyu.

623
00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:41,455
Good job.

624
00:50:43,081 --> 00:50:44,207
And thank you.

625
00:50:48,503 --> 00:50:49,880
I miss you.

626
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:54,468
I miss you a lot, Ho-gyu.

627
00:50:57,095 --> 00:50:58,722
Hey, pour him a glass of soju.

628
00:50:59,347 --> 00:51:00,348
Okay.

629
00:51:02,058 --> 00:51:04,936
You know, he's not good
at holding his liquor.

630
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:07,063
I need to pour him just a little bit.

631
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:12,360
If I give him two glasses,
he'll get drunk.

632
00:51:15,113 --> 00:51:17,073
It sounds like
you two had drinks together.

633
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:20,035
That day when you yelled at him,
I comforted him.

634
00:51:20,118 --> 00:51:22,162
So we had a few drinks together.

635
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:25,248
I see. You knew he can't hold his liquor,
but you still made him drink?

636
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:27,876
It's not what you think.

637
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:30,212
Nothing happened, right?

638
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:32,631
I think

639
00:51:33,089 --> 00:51:34,925
Ho-gyu sort of had a thing for me.

640
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:36,927
Really?

641
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:39,846
-Hey, he's probably listening.
-No.

642
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,348
Don't make up stuff now.

643
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:44,476
-Have you finished packing?
-Yes.

644
00:51:45,685 --> 00:51:46,853
Let's go.

645
00:51:49,731 --> 00:51:51,316
Are you emigrating or something?

646
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:54,778
Does my stuff duplicate itself
or something?

647
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:56,655
Why do I have so much stuff?

648
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:58,949
Let's go before the traffic jam starts.

649
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:07,624
Detective Jo.

650
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:10,210
-Thank you for your help.
-Good job.

651
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:12,629
-I appreciate your help.
-Goodbye.

652
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:16,049
Did you park the car over there?

653
00:52:16,132 --> 00:52:18,009
-Yes, it's parked over there.
-Okay.

654
00:52:19,886 --> 00:52:21,930
-Ms. Kim.
-What's going on?

655
00:52:22,013 --> 00:52:24,182
How could you not even say goodbye?

656
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:27,102
You didn't tell her?

657
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:29,020
No wonder she's disappointed.

658
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:32,482
Since our case is wrapped up,

659
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:34,484
we're going back to Seoul.

660
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:36,611
I don't think I can survive
in the countryside.

661
00:52:38,154 --> 00:52:38,989
What's wrong?

662
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:42,534
If you feel sad about saying goodbye,
should we have some gukbap

663
00:52:42,617 --> 00:52:43,952
-and soju? What do you say?
-Hey.

664
00:52:44,035 --> 00:52:45,954
Go and wait in the car. Hey.

665
00:52:46,621 --> 00:52:47,622
Take this.

666
00:52:48,081 --> 00:52:49,249
And wait in the car.

667
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:52,335
Ms. Kim.

668
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:03,054
Thank you.

669
00:53:04,764 --> 00:53:06,600
You found Sang-hun.

670
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:08,768
No. I...

671
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:11,771
I wish I'd done a better job.

672
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:13,398
Detective Jo.

673
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:15,525
I'll tell you what.

674
00:53:18,236 --> 00:53:21,197
There were several times
when I wanted to give up on everything.

675
00:53:22,657 --> 00:53:24,284
I was really scared.

676
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:26,202
Things looked bleak.

677
00:53:27,412 --> 00:53:29,789
I just wasn't confident that I could deal

678
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:32,208
with those hellish moments by myself.

679
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,795
But whenever I looked around,

680
00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:38,506
you were trying so hard with the case.

681
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:42,844
It wasn't like Sang-hun was your husband.

682
00:53:43,845 --> 00:53:45,931
Come on. Why are you saying that?

683
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:51,227
Anyway, I was able to finish it
thanks to you.

684
00:53:53,438 --> 00:53:54,898
I'm pretty sure

685
00:53:55,273 --> 00:53:57,609
I could have never done it by myself.

686
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:00,570
And I'm sure

687
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:03,990
Sang-hun is really grateful
for your help, too.

688
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:10,121
Do you hate Mr. Jeong Sang-hun?

689
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:15,335
I'll hate him for the rest of my life.

690
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:20,548
And I'll miss him
for the rest of my life, too.

691
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:25,679
I can't

692
00:54:28,306 --> 00:54:30,266
picture myself

693
00:54:30,892 --> 00:54:33,144
spending time without Sang-hun yet.

694
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:37,440
I'm sure you'll get through it.

695
00:54:39,192 --> 00:54:41,027
We won't probably see each other again.

696
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:42,862
Right.

697
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:45,615
We shouldn't.

698
00:54:58,753 --> 00:54:59,921
All right.

699
00:55:00,213 --> 00:55:01,673
Watch your step.

700
00:55:03,883 --> 00:55:05,010
Goodness.

701
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:07,387
This is nice, isn't it?

702
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:09,723
-Home is the best place to be, isn't it?
-Yes.

703
00:55:10,348 --> 00:55:13,435
Gosh, you've gotten so old now.

704
00:55:13,601 --> 00:55:15,228
Well, I do age, too.

705
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:20,483
We should say goodbye to the hospital

706
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:23,820
and live a healthy
and long life at home. Okay?

707
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:26,823
The house must be in a mess.
What should we do?

708
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:29,534
I told you to clean up
whenever you had time.

709
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:33,580
To be honest, I thought
my back was going to break yesterday.

710
00:55:34,205 --> 00:55:36,124
Good job, my son.

711
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:37,542
Take a seat.

712
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:46,593
When I was young,
this house looked so big.

713
00:55:50,555 --> 00:55:52,474
-Mom.
-Yes?

714
00:55:53,725 --> 00:55:55,852
How come you never talked about Ga-yeon?

715
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:01,191
Come to think of it,

716
00:56:03,234 --> 00:56:04,778
after that incident,

717
00:56:05,653 --> 00:56:07,238
you never talked about her.

718
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:09,491
You never brought her up.

719
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:13,328
Well, you're talking about her
for the first time, too.

720
00:56:15,413 --> 00:56:16,539
That's true.

721
00:56:17,999 --> 00:56:19,709
Gosh, it took quite a long time.

722
00:56:22,837 --> 00:56:23,963
Mom, how are you?

723
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:26,007
Do you still

724
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:28,134
think about her a lot?

725
00:56:31,012 --> 00:56:32,847
I think about her from time to time.

726
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:39,354
On some days, I don't know
what had gotten into me.

727
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:42,982
I would wake up in the middle of the night

728
00:56:43,441 --> 00:56:45,235
and cry my eyes out.

729
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:47,821
And on some days,

730
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:53,660
it surprises me
that I didn't think about her

731
00:56:53,993 --> 00:56:55,286
even once.

732
00:56:57,163 --> 00:56:59,249
And after all those years, I'm here.

733
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:03,169
My days

734
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:05,922
aren't always excruciatingly painful.

735
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:10,885
My days aren't always
without thoughts about her.

736
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:14,806
It goes back and forth.
The line gets blurred.

737
00:57:16,558 --> 00:57:17,892
-That's life, I guess.
-Okay.

738
00:57:22,897 --> 00:57:24,691
It must have been hard for you, too.

739
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:31,322
No. I've been okay
because I have you, Mom.

740
00:57:32,323 --> 00:57:34,451
I've been able to live until now
thanks to you, too.

741
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:51,593
Jo Tae-sik.

742
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:53,845
Tae-sik!

743
00:57:56,848 --> 00:57:57,682
Hey, Tae-sik.

744
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:00,351
I told you to wait for me.

745
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:06,566
Let's go together.

746
00:58:15,408 --> 00:58:17,327
When did you grow so tall?

747
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:20,330
You are still skinny.

748
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:22,165
Do you skip meals?

749
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:23,374
What are you talking about?

750
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:26,294
I eat a lot and gained weight, too.

751
00:58:27,712 --> 00:58:29,589
By the way, I'm a cop now.

752
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:32,383
I know that, too.

753
00:58:36,721 --> 00:58:38,014
It's all right, Tae-sik.

754
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:42,227
You heard what Mom said earlier, right?

755
00:58:43,144 --> 00:58:44,646
That's how life is.

756
00:58:44,729 --> 00:58:46,856
There are some good days and bad days.

757
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:52,695
I know that you've been torturing yourself
because of what happened to me.

758
00:58:52,904 --> 00:58:54,822
So I want you to stop thinking
about me now.

759
00:59:02,747 --> 00:59:05,208
Ga-yeon, where are you?

760
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:08,920
Ga-yeon.

761
00:59:09,754 --> 00:59:12,799
-Ga-yeon.
-Goodness, you guys are such crybabies.

762
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:14,968
Ga-yeon, where are you?

763
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:16,970
Stop pranking me.

764
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:18,638
Ga-yeon.

765
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:21,307
-Have a good life, my dear brother.
-Where are you, Ga-yeon?

766
00:59:54,507 --> 00:59:56,593
Take this!

767
00:59:58,261 --> 01:00:00,221
Let's go!

768
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:02,807
Charge forward!

769
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:31,252
Eun-seong.

770
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:37,508
It's my first time calling you
by your real name.

771
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:47,143
Eun-seong.

772
01:00:51,064 --> 01:00:52,565
Yu Eun-seong.

773
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:11,501
I'm sorry

774
01:01:13,252 --> 01:01:15,088
that we couldn't stay together longer.

775
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:17,919
