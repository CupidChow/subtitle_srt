1
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:42,167
THIS DRAMA IS A WORK OF FICTION.
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,

2
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,919
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGIONS, AND INCIDENTS
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,132
When our company was first established,

4
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,593
we produced great results

5
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:55,555
thanks to our bold
business expansions and investments.

6
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:00,101
I'm sure you're all well aware of that

7
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,270
since you all witnessed it.

8
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,357
But now, our company

9
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,612
is pathetic.

10
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:15,075
I'm sure you all agree.

11
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:20,663
The chairman turned his back on you guys
just because you didn't agree

12
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,290
with his opinions

13
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:26,294
and always remained dogmatic.

14
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:28,129
And as a result,

15
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:32,008
JQ Group is currently
facing the biggest crisis ever.

16
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:35,970
Our stock price plummeted
due to the disappearance

17
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,096
of Mr. Jeong Sang-hun.

18
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,225
And the recent exposure
of Mr. In Dong-gu's irregularities

19
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,144
has tainted our brand image.

20
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:48,441
If it turns out that Chairman Jeong
had been involved

21
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,819
in any of the recent happenings,

22
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,155
our company will end up
facing enormous pressure.

23
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:56,866
Before we end up being ruined altogether,

24
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:00,120
we must act first and get rid of

25
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:04,374
the actual root of all our problems.

26
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:06,417
How do you plan to do that?

27
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:08,920
We need an emergency
shareholders' meeting.

28
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:10,880
What will the agenda be?

29
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:12,757
The dismissal

30
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:15,927
of Chairman Jeong Yeong-mun.

31
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,224
Will that be possible?

32
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:23,852
We might be able to hold the meeting,

33
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:26,896
but Chairman Jeong still has
strong supporters.

34
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:31,067
It's going to take more than this
to make them turn their backs on him.

35
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:32,735
What if the new business gets canceled?

36
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,656
The chairman's been
putting in his best efforts

37
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,200
into the new business.

38
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:42,996
Mr. In committed those irregularities in
the process of carrying out the business.

39
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,876
There are already numerous suspicions
of murder and blackmailing.

40
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,130
What if the business he's been
risking everything for

41
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:54,465
ends up coming to nothing?

42
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:04,434
Then Chairman Jeong will be

43
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:06,603
left with nothing.

44
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,610
SURVIVOR

45
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,074
I heard about everything.

46
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,078
And I heard you helped catch In Dong-gu.

47
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:25,288
But,

48
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,124
I'll never forgive you.

49
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,587
The stuff you've done

50
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:36,633
are unforgivable.

51
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:43,056
I'm really sorry

52
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:47,769
about all that I've done.

53
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,111
I'm never...

54
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,489
I'm never going to see you again.

55
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:04,035
You won't be able to wash away your sins
just by going to jail.

56
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,414
You'd better repent
for the rest of your life.

57
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,458
And I mean, forever.

58
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,973
I heard you're getting sent
to the detention center tomorrow.

59
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,520
Tae-sik.

60
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:33,898
I'm really...

61
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,321
sorry.

62
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:47,954
I'll check

63
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:50,832
on your wife and kids.

64
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:55,295
Thank you.

65
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:01,134
Dae-yong.

66
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:03,428
It's about In Dong-gu.

67
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:06,306
If he was also looking for Jeong Sang-hun,

68
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,225
whom was he suspecting?

69
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:13,855
Every time a new suspect came up,

70
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:17,483
I gave the investigation materials
to In Dong-gu.

71
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,111
When we found the tire tracks

72
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:22,822
of Jin Yeong-min's car near the hospital,

73
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,577
In Dong-gu also seemed suspicious
of Jin Yeong-min just like you.

74
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,330
He also thought Jin Yeong-min

75
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:34,917
was the person who sent
the fake employee to the factory.

76
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,590
The uniform that Jin Yeong-min had...

77
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,259
That was In Dong-gu's doing.

78
00:05:58,483 --> 00:05:59,776
What's up?

79
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:05,907
Sang-hun is alive.

80
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:09,660
You know that, too.

81
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:12,246
You called me, let me hear his voice,

82
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,541
and told me to stop the new business.

83
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,293
What are you talking about?

84
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:21,422
You were the one who started this.

85
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:23,549
So I'm sure you know

86
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,303
who polluted the soils of Songju

87
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,472
and why the residents are sick.

88
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,309
If this goes public

89
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,520
and the new business gets canceled,

90
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:38,648
it'll affect my father-in-law.

91
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,652
And you're the one
who will benefit the most.

92
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,696
"Benefit"?

93
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:51,452
Would I do that just for the benefit?

94
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,080
You always felt inferior to Sang-hun.

95
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:57,375
You felt betrayed by the chairman
and was upset because of him.

96
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,086
You've had those emotions pent up
for the past 25 years.

97
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,047
Even an average guy
would turn into a monster like you.

98
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,882
If what you're saying is true,

99
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,218
then I wouldn't be the only one
who holds a grudge against

100
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,096
Sang-hun and the chairman.

101
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,141
If you know about the contamination,

102
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,978
then you also know
how many people got sacrificed.

103
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:19,105
You're just like Father.

104
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:22,859
You sacrificed Sang-hun
to take Father's position.

105
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,611
You really think I was the one
who did that to Sang-hun?

106
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:31,784
Then why am I still here?

107
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,621
It's because there's no evidence.

108
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:39,709
I was with you
even when his eye got delivered.

109
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:41,752
Detective Jo was there too.

110
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:46,090
I see you're still denying everything.

111
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,678
Then what if I don't stop
the new business?

112
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,015
What if the new business goes as planned

113
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,601
and puts my father-in-law at an advantage?

114
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:00,396
Then it'll make it hard for you
to take his place.

115
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:04,901
Is that okay with you?

116
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:09,572
Do whatever you want. I don't care.

117
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,659
But will you be okay?

118
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,872
Sang-hun might die
if you don't listen to the culprit.

119
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,417
Didn't you say you'll do everything

120
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:23,961
to save Sang-hun?

121
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,840
Then you should do it.

122
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,594
It's what the culprit wants.

123
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,568
We're finally back,

124
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:51,239
but our team has got cut in half.

125
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,245
Gosh.

126
00:08:58,496 --> 00:08:59,664
Can we use this?

127
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,335
Are these the only chairs?

128
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:11,717
Hello.

129
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,469
We got dispatched to this team.

130
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,930
-I'm Seo Seok-gyo.
-I'm Kim Seung-hyeon.

131
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:18,599
-Hello.
-Hello, I'm Jo Tae-sik.

132
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:26,107
Show them their desks
and give them an update.

133
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:27,692
Come inside.

134
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:30,987
You can choose where to sit
between the two desks.

135
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,908
How did Jin Yeong-min react?

136
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:39,203
He's definitely the culprit. It was him.

137
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:42,540
He definitely wants me to stop
the new business.

138
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:45,626
Did you get anything
regarding the accomplice?

139
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,547
If Jin Yeong-min is the culprit,
he would've received help.

140
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:52,883
Remember when the eye got delivered?

141
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:55,636
He got released thanks to his alibi.

142
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,389
And you and I were there
to prove his alibi.

143
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:01,851
There must be an accomplice.

144
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:06,063
Someone else has Jeong Sang-hun
and is harming him instead

145
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:10,318
so that Jin Yeong-min will stay innocent
and continue to have an alibi.

146
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,238
If we want to arrest him,
we need to find his accomplice.

147
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,449
We don't have any evidence.

148
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,660
If we want to save Jeong Sang-hun
as quickly as possible,

149
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,829
we must find who the accomplice is.

150
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,833
How about I meet Yeong-min
and call his bluff?

151
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:29,128
He obviously won't tell you the truth.

152
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,548
That depends on what I say to him.

153
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,259
If what you're saying is true,

154
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,971
then I wouldn't be the only one
who holds a grudge against

155
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,016
Sang-hun and the chairman.

156
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,685
If you know about the contamination,

157
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:49,440
then you also know
how many people got sacrificed.

158
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:52,693
It might be someone

159
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:54,945
who holds a grudge

160
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,784
against my father-in-law or JQ Group
just like Yeong-min.

161
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:01,452
Well, of course.

162
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:05,164
You'd have to hold a grudge
to be involved in something like this.

163
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:09,877
But when I looked into Jin Yeong-min's
call logs or acquaintances,

164
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,213
I couldn't find anyone
that seemed strange.

165
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,048
How is that possible?

166
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:18,719
If there really is an accomplice,
he'd surely be keeping in touch.

167
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,389
How could there be no traces of contact?

168
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:23,682
Jin Yeong-min's a very meticulous guy.

169
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:27,978
He could've avoided any types of contact
that might leave a record.

170
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:31,315
Especially if he knows
that we're already suspicious of him.

171
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:39,532
Do you really think he'll kill Sang-hun

172
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,161
if I don't stop the new business?

173
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:46,914
No, wait.

174
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:49,500
Do you think he'll free Sang-hun

175
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:53,712
even if I do stop the new business?

176
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:55,798
We don't have

177
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,509
any other options at this point.

178
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:03,180
We'll at least be able to buy some time.
And while we do that,

179
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,309
I'll find the accomplice no matter what.

180
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:11,856
I promise.

181
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,152
HEAVY METAL CONTENT

182
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:17,653
CONCLUSION

183
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:25,327
Is this all true?

184
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:28,122
Yes, everything you just read is true.

185
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:31,459
They really planned the new business
to conceal the contamination?

186
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:34,795
And Mr. Hong and the ruling party
helped JQ Group do this?

187
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:37,339
Only a few people know

188
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,258
what's really going on.

189
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:43,512
Most of them are just looking forward
to the profit they'll be getting from JQ.

190
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:47,808
Why are you showing me this?

191
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:50,811
We're not in the same party,
and it's not like we're close.

192
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:54,857
I'm sure you already know
that I don't really like you.

193
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,694
I need to do everything I can
to stop this business.

194
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:04,325
And you've been against this business
more than anyone I know.

195
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:06,827
So I'm asking you for a favor.

196
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:12,082
The general meeting is in two days.
We don't have much time.

197
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,294
We need to stop them
from passing the bill.

198
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:21,175
You want me to convince
the opposition party to oppose the bill?

199
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,010
Yes.

200
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,513
It's too late.

201
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:30,017
It's not just the ruling party
who expect to benefit from the business.

202
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:32,186
Is there any other way?

203
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:36,148
The two of us have no power
to delay the general meeting.

204
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:39,068
And it's practically impossible

205
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,695
to change people's minds in just two days.

206
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:44,240
Maybe we could convince
a bit over a dozen people,

207
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,535
but we'll need way more than that
to outvote the opponents.

208
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,411
How about a press conference?

209
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,206
-A press conference?
-Yes.

210
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:55,042
-Before the general meeting?
-If we use the public opinion,

211
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:58,921
it will pressure
those who are in favor of the bill.

212
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:02,007
They might not want to go against
the public opinion

213
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,260
and end up changing their minds.

214
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:05,844
That's not a bad idea.

215
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:08,722
Then I'll gather the reporters.

216
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:11,850
-But before that, we need something.
-Okay.

217
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:15,563
We need a testimony to prove that JQ
is responsible for the contamination.

218
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:18,399
-Everything is on that report.
-No,

219
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:21,610
this only proves the contamination
of the underground water in Songju.

220
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,280
It's not enough to prove
that JQ was directly involved with it.

221
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:27,783
When it comes to stuff like this,
it's important to have someone

222
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,952
who actually witnessed the scene
or took part in it.

223
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:34,373
Without that, you could get condemned
for making an unreasonable argument.

224
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:36,667
A testimony from an insider?

225
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,016
A funeral hall?

226
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:41,398
TAXI

227
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:46,695
I guess not.

228
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:50,616
I knew it.

229
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:03,921
BOOKSTORE

230
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:35,369
I'm sure he's not here to buy a book.

231
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,249
What is that jerk doing?

232
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:47,798
Hello.

233
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:51,135
I'm Yeon-u's dad.

234
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:53,470
Oh, right. Hello.

235
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:55,639
-Have you been well?
-Yes.

236
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,142
How come you are here?

237
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:02,438
I had some business near the area.

238
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,481
What brings you here?

239
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,316
My workplace is nearby.

240
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,360
Oh, I see.

241
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:22,249
I should get going now. Bye.

242
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:34,887
There were about four guys

243
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,639
who were in charge of disposing
the wastewater in Jeonggeon Steelwork.

244
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:41,060
And everyone passed away
except for one guy.

245
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,061
HA JUNG-SEOP

246
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:48,567
Ha Jung-seop.
He's the only one who's still alive.

247
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,081
Twenty years ago?

248
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:08,545
I always knew I should be prepared

249
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:11,423
for something like this.

250
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:15,052
Can you tell me

251
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:18,347
what happened back then
at Jeonggeon Steelwork?

252
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:24,478
There used to be a lake.

253
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,565
There used to be a lake

254
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,693
where RMC is currently located.

255
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:36,657
I...

256
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,493
I mean, we...

257
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:42,454
We threw

258
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:44,832
everything away in the lake.

259
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:05,686
JEONGGEON STEELWORK

260
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:07,980
JEONGGEON STEELWORK

261
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:32,880
I knew what it was.

262
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,507
But I had to pretend like I didn't know.

263
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:38,760
I had no choice back then.

264
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:45,726
But I still felt uneasy
every once in a while.

265
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:50,731
I felt even more uneasy when I heard
that the lake was going to be replaced

266
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:52,232
with an RMC lot.

267
00:19:56,195 --> 00:20:00,616
JEONGGEON STEELWORK

268
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:12,544
Even though it's been a long time,

269
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:16,506
it still makes me feel restless at times.

270
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,302
I wonder what eventually happened

271
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:22,804
and worry that something
might've gone wrong.

272
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:25,557
Every time I think of that,

273
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,644
I feel so uneasy

274
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:31,271
that I can't even sleep at night.

275
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,733
I thought avoiding the place might help.

276
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:36,777
So I never once

277
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:41,156
visited that place after what happened.

278
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:45,827
A lot of the residents there are sick.

279
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:49,665
The wastewater

280
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,126
flew into the underground water.

281
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:58,090
People who knew nothing about that
drank and used that water.

282
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,885
My goodness. Oh, dear.

283
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,097
Sir.

284
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:08,100
I'm planning to hold a press conference

285
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:09,851
about what Jeonggeon did.

286
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:14,189
I'll disclose this to the public.

287
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,025
Do you think

288
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:19,653
you can help me do that?

289
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:23,532
It's not too late.

290
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:29,830
I'll do it.

291
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,542
I don't have much time left
in this world anyway.

292
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:36,795
Okay.

293
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:41,300
Let's do the press conference.

294
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:43,051
Thank you.

295
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:46,054
Thank you, sir.

296
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,557
Thank you so much.

297
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:51,226
Jin Yeong-min is so weird.

298
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,479
So he drove his car to the funeral hall.

299
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:57,190
Then he grabbed a cab
and went to a bookstore.

300
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:58,817
Then he just went back to his office?

301
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,653
I'm sure he went there
to meet the accomplice.

302
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:07,659
Unless he went there to meet with someone,
his route doesn't make sense.

303
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:09,995
There's a bookstore near his workplace.

304
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,081
Maybe he noticed
that you were following him.

305
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,751
Maybe that's why he didn't meet
with anyone.

306
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:17,294
That could be a possibility.

307
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:19,880
If not...

308
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:31,767
Maybe he never planned to meet with anyone
in the first place.

309
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:39,357
Where did he go?

310
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,896
Mr. In was transferred
to the detention center today.

311
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:23,068
He hasn't said anything yet.

312
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:26,863
I don't think he would do something
you should worry about.

313
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:30,951
The general meeting is coming up.

314
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:35,122
Do we have enough members
to vote for the bill?

315
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:39,543
Yes. Assemblyman Hong is contacting
the opposition members.

316
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,128
What about Mr. Gong?

317
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:46,842
He should be making a move by now.

318
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:50,095
Has he shown any signs?

319
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:53,765
No. He hasn't done anything special yet.

320
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:57,477
And there's nothing he can do

321
00:23:58,228 --> 00:23:59,563
with his shares.

322
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,023
Please don't worry.

323
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,359
He still bothers me.

324
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:07,279
I should've gotten rid of him sooner.

325
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:09,531
Once the bill is approved,

326
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:10,740
I should

327
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,618
take care of Mr. Gong as soon as possible.

328
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,415
Don't let your guard down
and keep an eye on him.

329
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:22,294
He'll try to find an opportunity

330
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,505
to make his comeback

331
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:28,967
as Sang-hun's seat is vacant for now.

332
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,804
I'll make sure to watch him closely.

333
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,352
BOOKSTORE

334
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:45,025
What?

335
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:50,488
This guy...

336
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:53,241
Can I check the footage
of the security camera on the other side?

337
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:54,242
Sure.

338
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:04,878
-Play it again.
-Okay.

339
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:11,259
A note?

340
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,596
That's how they made contact.

341
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:20,644
The 11 directors you met with
the other day

342
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:22,604
will attend the shareholders' meeting.

343
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:28,109
And they all promised to vote for you.

344
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:30,528
What about Mr. Gong?

345
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:32,447
I just talked to him on the phone.

346
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:34,908
He said he'll support you.

347
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:39,204
I'm pretty sure we will win the majority.

348
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:41,873
Thank you for your work.

349
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,252
Once the shareholders' meeting is over,

350
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:47,379
I'll give you my position

351
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,632
as I promised.

352
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,700
Hello.

353
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:19,619
I'm Yeon-u's dad.

354
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:22,038
I see. Nice to meet you.

355
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:24,165
Have you been well?

356
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,542
What brings you here?

357
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,044
My workplace is nearby.

358
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:33,466
Why would he contact Jin Yeong-min?

359
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:40,432
Hey, Jin-gyeong.

360
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:42,642
-Did you find it?
-Yes.

361
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,146
GO SEUNG-WON

362
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:48,648
Why are you running
a background check on this guy?

363
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:53,361
It might be someone who holds a grudge

364
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:59,034
against my father-in-law or JQ Group
just like Yeong-min.

365
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:01,619
Someone Jin Yeong-min might need
in order to

366
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,830
get rid of Jeong Yeong-mun and In Dong-gu.

367
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:05,999
It's been a few months
since my son is gone.

368
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,626
But I haven't got rid of his stuff yet.

369
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:13,006
I just couldn't do it.

370
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:16,509
Once he found out the truth, he would have
the biggest vendetta against JQ.

371
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:19,137
Is the suspect from the medical field?

372
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:24,684
The way it was extracted...

373
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:28,271
It was well-executed.

374
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:32,359
Someone from the medical field
who can chop off a body part

375
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:34,319
without actually killing the person.

376
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:35,653
VETERINARIAN

377
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:38,239
Yeon-u's dad...

378
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:41,701
It's him. He was the accomplice.

379
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:43,745
What?

380
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:49,626
He's feeling much better now.

381
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:51,586
Thank you.

382
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:54,798
Please give him the medicine twice a day.

383
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,176
-This is a gift.
-Thank you.

384
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:00,136
You can give it to him after a meal.

385
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:03,723
-Thank you. Bye.
-Thank you. Have a nice day.

386
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:17,529
WE'RE CLOSED TODAY

387
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:37,757
Let's go.

388
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:40,510
It's important to locate
Jeong Sang-hun's whereabouts.

389
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:42,554
We're going to his clinic and house
in two groups.

390
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:44,347
-Hurry.
-Let's go.

391
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:05,618
-Let's break in.
-Okay.

392
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:11,166
Go and find Jeong Sang-hun's traces.

393
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:16,379
Go that way.

394
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:20,216
Hurry.

395
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:30,143
Not here.

396
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:36,065
-He's not here.
-No?

397
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:38,568
-Isn't he in that room?
-No.

398
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:44,157
Come here.

399
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:48,119
His dog is here.

400
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,289
VETERINARY CLINIC

401
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:52,499
Thank you.

402
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,339
-No one's here.
-He's not here either.

403
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,925
Search every corner.
Find Jeong Sang-hun's traces.

404
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:03,301
Okay.

405
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:16,105
-Yes.
-Hello?

406
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:19,192
Tae-sik, he's not home.
And his car isn't here.

407
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:21,486
There's no trace of Jeong Sang-hun.

408
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:23,238
He's not here either.

409
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:31,996
ANESTHETIC

410
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:35,917
Go Seung-won might have
gone to where Jeong Sang-hun is.

411
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:40,004
Track his phone now and check
the security cameras in the vicinity.

412
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:41,381
Okay, I will.

413
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:45,385
Call KCSI to examine the place.

414
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:46,511
-Okay.
-Yes, sir.

415
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:47,720
Make a call.

416
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:51,099
-What's going on?
-Do you guys know anything?

417
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:54,227
It seems to be top secret.
What is it about?

418
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:56,813
If Kim Seo-hui's doing a conference,
isn't it about her husband?

419
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:58,314
-That'd be a scoop.
-She's here.

420
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:10,159
Thank you all for coming here.

421
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:11,828
I'm Assemblywoman Kim Seo-hui.

422
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:14,539
Today, I'd like to talk

423
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:16,499
about the special bill

424
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,544
for the new renewable energy project

425
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:22,714
I proposed the other day

426
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:25,383
and fix the problems
regarding the project.

427
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,510
That's why I'm here today.

428
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:29,888
-What about the bill?
-What's wrong with it?

429
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,814
When I first became an assemblywoman,

430
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,317
I believed it's the right thing to do

431
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,068
to propose a bill about the project.

432
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:46,487
But I recently realized

433
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,699
that it was a huge mistake

434
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:53,119
to have proposed the bill.

435
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:55,705
-What?
-Why was it a mistake?

436
00:31:55,788 --> 00:31:57,707
Contrary to what was known
at the beginning,

437
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:00,585
the new renewable energy project

438
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:02,420
was started with impure purposes

439
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:05,673
hidden in it from the beginning.

440
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,718
Are you saying that the project
had a problem when your father,

441
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:10,386
Assemblyman Kim Seung-cheol, began it?

442
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,805
What do you mean by "impure purposes"?

443
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:18,603
The energy companies
selected for the project

444
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:22,148
as well as the main members
of Liberal Democratic Party

445
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:25,234
made unfair profit due to the bill.

446
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:27,070
In the process,

447
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:30,281
they tried to cover up the wrong
they had committed.

448
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:33,576
They even took many people's lives

449
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:36,079
without hesitation.

450
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:38,998
-What?
-Does she mean that people died?

451
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:48,758
Are you doing all right?

452
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:51,678
-It's time to go.
-Okay.

453
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:57,350
The general meeting is tomorrow.

454
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:59,811
This is such a sudden crisis.

455
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:01,646
We can't just sit back and watch.

456
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:04,357
We have to stop this no matter what.

457
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,443
This isn't something I can stop.

458
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:10,196
What do we do now?

459
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:13,616
Do you think Seo-hui will
stop the whole thing

460
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:15,994
even if we block the press conference?

461
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,036
Then

462
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:19,372
what are you going to do?

463
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,008
Do you mean they committed murder?

464
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:33,428
Are you talking about JQ Group?

465
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,555
Is JQ Group involved in the murders?

466
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:37,473
Does Chairman Jeong know
about this conference?

467
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:40,226
-Are you saying people are killed?
-Why are you revealing this?

468
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:41,894
-Can you tell us more?
-Please answer us.

469
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:45,606
Yes. We have a witness
who will give testimony

470
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,567
about the whole thing.

471
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:52,613
Ever since I first established Jeonggeon

472
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:55,616
and made it into JQ Group of today,

473
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,785
the biggest challenge for me

474
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:00,913
has been not to be swayed

475
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:03,249
by personal feelings.

476
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:06,294
Even just tiniest feelings

477
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:08,379
can ruin the whole thing

478
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:10,923
when you run a huge company.

479
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:15,511
I've witnessed situations like that
my whole life.

480
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:19,182
That's how I've run JQ Group.

481
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:21,267
Sir.

482
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:23,978
It's about Seo-hui.

483
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,523
Is she still useful to us?

484
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:32,403
Thanks to her, we proposed the bill

485
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:34,906
and secured enough votes for it.

486
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,574
We won't have a problem at the meeting.

487
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:42,038
Are you saying...

488
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:46,250
She managed to salvage and finish the work

489
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:48,252
Kim Seung-cheol had messed up.

490
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:52,256
I think that's enough for us.

491
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:15,905
It was hard for me
to decide to stand at this place.

492
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:20,243
But it always takes a lot of nerve

493
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:23,412
to keep the faith and do the right thing.

494
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,791
I believe now is the time.

495
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:28,709
That's why I'm standing here today.

496
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:31,170
Twenty years ago,

497
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:34,382
I was in charge
of the wastewater treatment

498
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:36,717
at JQ Group, which was formerly

499
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:39,345
Jeonggeon Steelwork.

500
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:42,181
Chairman Jeong Yeong-mun was

501
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:45,351
nothing like other CEOs back then.

502
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:48,980
He took care of every detail

503
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:51,149
of the factory process.

504
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:53,276
He also ordered

505
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:55,570
to take extra care

506
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:58,322
on wastewater treatment

507
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:01,742
even better than other departments.

508
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:05,997
I'd like to make this clear right here

509
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,167
with my whole life of 68 years.

510
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,377
The contamination in Songju

511
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,380
was caused by Songju RMC.

512
00:36:14,463 --> 00:36:18,467
It has nothing to do
with Jeonggeon Steelwork.

513
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:20,636
Sir, what are you doing?

514
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,055
-The company...
-Something is wrong. Please wait.

515
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:24,265
-He also...
-Please get out.

516
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:26,267
-Hey, stop it!
-He focused on the clean-up work

517
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,560
-and medical support
-Hey!

518
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:30,563
-for the local residents.
-This is a fraud!

519
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:33,149
He worked hard to normalize...

520
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:35,693
-No, that's not true.
-the lot

521
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:36,986
-Sir.
-for the new business.

522
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:38,404
Sir.

523
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:39,822
Why are you doing this?

524
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:42,325
What are you talking about?

525
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:47,705
But Assemblywoman Kim Seo-hui asked me

526
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:52,418
to give false testimony
that JQ is the cause of the contamination

527
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:55,171
as she failed to receive the sponsorship

528
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:56,714
-No, that's not true.
-she expected.

529
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:58,591
-She forced me...
-No, I've never done that.

530
00:36:58,674 --> 00:36:59,550
Please stop, sir.

531
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:01,928
-In order to threaten
-That's not true at all.

532
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:03,971
Chairman Jeong Yeong-mun.

533
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,307
What are you talking about, sir?

534
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,851
Assemblywoman Kim, is that true?

535
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:10,561
-What does that mean?
-Please answer it.

536
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:13,356
Please tell us what happened.

537
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:30,456
I think we made a pact

538
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:35,795
when I helped you
keep your son out of jail

539
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:38,923
five years ago.

540
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:43,344
How could you disappoint me like that?

541
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:45,513
I'm sorry, sir.

542
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:47,932
I can't

543
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:50,434
ignore my conscience anymore--

544
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:53,479
It's not hard for me to send your son

545
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,273
back to jail.

546
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:59,235
I can even isolate him from the world

547
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:03,281
so you won't be able
to see him ever again.

548
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:06,492
It would be very easy for me.

549
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:09,870
You should make a choice.

550
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:13,124
Is it your son

551
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:16,335
or your guilty conscience?

552
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,884
I see you knew all about it, sir.

553
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,387
You knew what Kim Seo-hui was up to.

554
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:29,056
Do you know what makes people

555
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:34,645
like the late Mr. Kim and Seo-hui
dare to stand against me?

556
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:39,483
They have the power called morals.

557
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:41,819
They believe it's their exclusive property

558
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:43,571
and power.

559
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,197
But,

560
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,660
it is easily knocked down
like a sandcastle.

561
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,288
I should respond

562
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:55,249
to a show with another show.

563
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:58,419
Ms. Nam.

564
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:02,673
I'll need you to do something for me.

565
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,387
BAREUN NEWS
ASSEMBLYWOMAN KIM PUTS ON A SHOW

566
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:11,640
Go ahead.

567
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:13,309
Let's start.

568
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:14,352
Upload it.

569
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:15,978
-Okay.
-Yes, sir.

570
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,319
ARTICLE UPLOADED

571
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:26,572
KIM SEO-HUI BUYS OFF
WITNESSES TO SLANDER JQ

572
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:29,241
That is not true. I did not coerce him
to make a statement.

573
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:31,994
I do not understand why

574
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,955
he has suddenly changed his mind.

575
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:37,333
I can explain everything.

576
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:38,751
Please direct your attention here.

577
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:41,045
This is the analysis report from the lab.

578
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:42,588
The source of the contamination...

579
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:44,673
-What is this?
-What?

580
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:47,051
-What is this?
-JQ's statement?

581
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:48,844
-Did you read this?
-Is this true?

582
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:50,179
This was just published.

583
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:51,597
What's going on?

584
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:54,683
Ms. Kim, JQ just made a statement
regarding this matter.

585
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:56,227
After you've been elected,

586
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:58,813
JQ claimed that you've been
demanding too much political fund.

587
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:00,856
-Pardon?
-What's your response to that?

588
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,150
Can you rebut the statement from JQ?

589
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:04,902
Please explain this.
What's this all about?

590
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:07,029
-Is this true?
-Please explain this statement.

591
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:08,280
-Political fund?
-What's this?

592
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:10,491
-Did you ask for money?
-It says you asked for it.

593
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:12,368
-That's absurd.
-What's this statement about?

594
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:14,370
I am not aware of this statement
you speak of.

595
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:15,746
That is not true.

596
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,165
-You must know what's going on.
-Explain it to us in detail.

597
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,419
Mr. Lee.

598
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:24,046
The press conference didn't go well.

599
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,506
Chairman Jeong beat us to it.

600
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:30,052
We must have the shareholders' meeting
sooner. We must make our move first.

601
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:34,598
"False witness"?

602
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:37,810
What's this? What's going on here?

603
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:41,480
If the press conference failed,

604
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:43,566
Jin Yeong-min would have found out by now.

605
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:46,068
Then, what about Jeong Sang-hun?

606
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:48,737
Tae-sik.

607
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:50,156
Hey. Update me.

608
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:53,325
We can't track his phone
because that bastard turned off his phone.

609
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:55,703
And we have the security footage
of him leaving his house.

610
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:57,580
The guys are working on the rest.

611
00:40:57,663 --> 00:40:59,665
We don't have time to wait around
until we get that.

612
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:01,459
He took the anesthetic.

613
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:03,627
What if he left
because he figured out that I know?

614
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:07,089
I doubt that bastard will
kill Jeong Sang-hun.

615
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:08,757
No,

616
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:10,718
he's more than capable.

617
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:13,345
What? What do we do then?

618
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:17,057
If Jeong Sang-hun is still alive
after losing his hand, foot, and eye,

619
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:19,185
it means Go Seung-won
has been taking care of him

620
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:20,769
-so he doesn't die.
-Right.

621
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:24,523
To ensure no one finds out what he's up to
while looking after a man in such a state,

622
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:26,734
I'm sure he picked a familiar place

623
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:28,360
that he knows inside and out.

624
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:30,154
A familiar place?

625
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:31,739
GPS.

626
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:34,200
Damn it. He took his car.

627
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:35,868
We can't get our hands on it.

628
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:38,120
The record at the tollgate.

629
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:42,291
If you use Hi-Pass, the Transport
Authority gets all of your records.

630
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:43,751
Get me Go Seung-won's records.

631
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:44,877
I'm on it.

632
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:56,096
Ms. Kim.

633
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,891
The accusation about the political fund
isn't true, right?

634
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:02,853
I can't believe they used
the witness against us.

635
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:04,146
I won't give up.

636
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:05,981
There still will be a chance.

637
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:08,192
The general meeting hasn't started yet.

638
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,320
I'm sure some people will believe me.

639
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:14,323
Let's do everything we can.

640
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:16,784
Assemblymen and women
in leadership positions won't join us,

641
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:19,662
but first-term assemblymen and women
will be different.

642
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:21,413
Let's try whatever we can.

643
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:29,547
Tae-sik.

644
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:32,550
This is the record of Go Seung-won's
Hi-Pass from March until now.

645
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:33,634
Okay.

646
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:36,971
Jeong Sang-hun's hand was found
on March 7.

647
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:39,890
They said it was delivered within
24 hours after the amputation.

648
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:43,143
The hand was probably severed
between March 6 and 7.

649
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:45,354
His foot and his eye

650
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:48,107
were cut and extracted a day
before we found them.

651
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:51,819
His foot was severed on April 2,
and his eye was extracted on April 28.

652
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:53,779
CHEONGJU

653
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:56,824
"Cheongju."

654
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:59,201
We haven't been able to reach you
since yesterday.

655
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:00,828
Where were you?

656
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:02,663
I was out of town for work.

657
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:06,458
Before the culprit sent the eye,

658
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:07,876
we couldn't reach Jin Yeong-min.

659
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,211
He said that he was out of town.

660
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:10,588
-Yes.
-Where did he go?

661
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:12,172
Let me check.

662
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:15,593

WEEKLY SCHEDULE

665
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:18,971
STATEMENT

666
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:20,973
It says here that he went to Cheongju.

667
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:26,437
Go Seung-won went to Cheongju
when his body parts were severed.

668
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,691
It's Cheongju. They are hiding
Jeong Sang-hun in Cheongju.

669
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:35,487
Find out if there are places Go Seung-won
might be related to in Cheongju.

670
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:36,864
Got it.

671
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:44,163
-Hello, sir.
-Ms. Kim.

672
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:46,332
I'd like to discuss something with you.

673
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:48,167
After JQ set up a factory there,

674
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:50,002
the groundwater got completely tainted.

675
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:52,588
They are pushing for the new business
to cover this up.

676
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:55,257
There's not much our party can do.

677
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:04,266
Sir, this bill cannot be passed
no matter what.

678
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:08,187
TEMPORARY MEETING OF JQ GROUP SHAREHOLDERS

679
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:17,613
I hope everything's fine.

680
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:30,125
VOTE ON THE BILL
ABOUT THE NEW ENERGY BUSINESS

681
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:39,551
This way.

682
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:52,564
As the minimum number
of assemblymen and women is met,

683
00:44:53,315 --> 00:44:56,360
the first session of the general meeting
will commence now.

684
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:01,407
Sir.

685
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:07,830
A temporary meeting of shareholders
is being held at the headquarters.

686
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:10,457
What's the agenda?

687
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:12,376
The agenda is

688
00:45:13,335 --> 00:45:14,545
your dismissal.

689
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:24,596
The agenda for today's temporary meeting
of shareholders

690
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:27,141
is the dismissal
of Chairman Jeong Yeong-mum.

691
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:29,935
We will now proceed with the vote.

692
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:41,155
Please make a vote on the special bill
proposed by Assemblywoman Kim Seo-hui

693

along with 20 other assemblymen and women

694
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:48,495
for the establishment of the new renewable
energy business complex in Songju.

695
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:53,125
VOTE ON THE BILL

696
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:54,084

00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:26,366
BALLOT BOX

705
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:38,128
The total of 256 assemblymen
and women are present.

706
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:40,881
There were 148 votes in favor of the bill.

707
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:43,717
There were 102 votes against the bill.

708
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:45,969
And six votes were blank.

709
00:46:46,553 --> 00:46:48,722
I will announce the result of the vote.

710
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:51,850
As 41 percent of the shareholders
were in favor,

711
00:46:52,434 --> 00:46:54,394
and 52 percent of the shareholders
were against it,

712
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:57,105
I declare the dismissal
of Chairman Jeong Yeong-mum

713
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:59,274
has been voted down.

714
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:02,444
I declare the special bill proposed
by Assemblywoman Kim Seo-hui

715
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:06,031
along with 20 other assemblymen and women

716
00:47:06,114 --> 00:47:10,118
for the new renewable energy business
complex in Songju has been passed.

717
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:11,453
IN FAVOR 148
AGAINST 102

718
00:47:12,287 --> 00:47:13,330
Congratulations.

719
00:47:13,705 --> 00:47:14,998
Good work.

720
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:16,375
Well done.

721
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:17,501
Gosh.

722
00:47:41,066 --> 00:47:43,860
I don't understand
how things have gotten this bad.

723
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:49,658
Mr. In and I were doing everything
in our power to control the situation.

724
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:51,910
In that case,

725
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:56,915
there was only one explanation.

726
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:02,254
I realized that
unless someone very close to me

727
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,924
have been keeping information from me

728
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:08,427
and plotting against me behind my back,

729
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:10,596
this would have never happened.

730
00:48:20,897 --> 00:48:22,357
Explain to me

731
00:48:23,191 --> 00:48:26,028
what kind of scheme
Mr. Jin is plotting against me.

732
00:48:26,903 --> 00:48:29,906
Sir, I did not do anything.

733
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:31,074
I will

734
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:33,910
appoint you as the vice-chairman.

735
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:38,332
You have been working for me
ever since I established Jeonggeon.

736
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:40,208
We have worked so hard for JQ.

737
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:43,170
Will you let a mere opportunist

738
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:47,674
who's been eyeing Sang-hun's seat
take control over this company?

739
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:51,136
Don't you think working for me
is a much better deal

740
00:48:51,219 --> 00:48:54,723
than working
for a greedy peasant like him?

741
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:58,685
Make your decision now.

742
00:48:58,977 --> 00:48:59,978
This is

743
00:49:01,146 --> 00:49:02,606
my only offer.

744
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:08,278
GONG JONG-HO

745
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:09,821
AGAINST

746
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:24,753
-How is this possible?
-Something's gone wrong.

747
00:49:24,836 --> 00:49:27,547
-Is it over now?
-I guess so.

748
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:30,133
-What now?
-We'll have to wait and see.

749
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:31,551
-What's this?
-What just happened?

750
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:33,637
-Now we have to...
-Gosh.

751
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,639
-What's going on?
-How...

752
00:49:35,722 --> 00:49:37,766
-Damn it.
-I can't believe this.

753
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:39,893
-How could this happen?
-Come on.

754
00:49:39,976 --> 00:49:42,104
-Damn it.
-I can't believe this.

755
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:01,331
Tae-sik.

756
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:04,376
Go Seung-won has
a vacation home in Cheongju.

757
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:06,253
It's under his son's name.

758
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:10,674
Tae-sik. Tae-sik!

759
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:13,552
All right. Let's go.

760
00:50:13,635 --> 00:50:14,886
-Okay. Let's go.
-Everyone, move.

761
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:16,513
Let's go to Cheongju now!

762
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:28,316
-This all worked out.
-My goodness.

763
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,401
-Great.
-I know, right?

764
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:32,404
Right. Yes.

765
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:36,867
-I was very worried, you know.
-Look.

766
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:39,244
-It can't end like this.
-Go on another trip.

767
00:50:40,078 --> 00:50:41,413
Not like this.

768
00:51:02,934 --> 00:51:04,436
-You guys, go inside.
-Okay.

769
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:06,188
-Go through the back.
-Yes, sir.

770
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:12,903
-Over there.
-Okay.

771
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:19,743
-Search every corner.
-Yes, sir.

772
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:20,952
You guys, check upstairs.

773
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:22,037
Yes, sir.

774
00:51:42,307 --> 00:51:44,351
I found a path to the basement.

775
00:51:45,143 --> 00:51:46,144
Tae-sik.

776
00:51:51,691 --> 00:51:53,527
-Where is it?
-Right here.

777
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:11,211
What kind of place is this?

778
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:12,838
This place looks creepy.

779
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:32,042
Check outside.

780
00:53:41,593 --> 00:53:43,929
Come here and take a look, Detective Jo.

781
00:53:44,012 --> 00:53:45,013
What is it?

782
00:53:46,264 --> 00:53:47,933
I think we might have just missed him.

783
00:53:52,437 --> 00:53:53,939
Damn it.

784
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:56,816
Tae-sik.

785
00:53:57,859 --> 00:53:59,569
I think I smell blood here.

786
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:08,870
Call the KCSI,

787
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:11,289
and tell them to check the blood reaction.

788
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:14,960
KCSI, come down to the basement now.

789
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:17,545
KCSI, to the basement now.

790
00:54:22,884 --> 00:54:24,094
Detective Jo, it's ready.

791
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:26,846
Hey, turn off the light.

792
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:49,244
Damn it.

793
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,387
He's driving away now.

794
00:55:07,929 --> 00:55:09,014
What?

795
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:11,182
Hey, let's go.

796
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:12,892
-Shit.
-Damn it.

797
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:44,841
Hey, Commissioner-General Park. It's me.

798
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:50,847
Where is In Dong-gu now?

799
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:00,250
Get on his tail.

800
00:57:03,336 --> 00:57:04,796
Closer. Surround him.

801
00:57:10,176 --> 00:57:12,011
-Gosh.
-That bastard.

802
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:23,106
You guys stop him from the opposite side.

803
00:57:30,738 --> 00:57:32,073
Has that jerk lost his mind?

804
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:38,288
Is he trying to get himself killed?

805
00:57:38,371 --> 00:57:40,915
Tae-sik, are you all right? Be careful.

806
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:58,433
What the heck? Move! Get out of our way!

807
00:57:58,516 --> 00:57:59,642
Pull back.

808
00:58:03,188 --> 00:58:04,772
This should be enough.

809
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:10,278
Damn it.

810
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:13,698
What?

811
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:16,659
What's he doing?

812
00:58:19,704 --> 00:58:21,581
-Everyone, come with me.
-Get out of the car.

813
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:23,833
Go Seung-won, get out of the car now!

814
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:25,376
Did you not hear us? Go Seung-won!

815
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:26,544
Get out of the car!

816
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:30,548
Go Seung-won, get out of the car.

817
00:58:32,717 --> 00:58:35,136
Go Seung-won. Get out now!

818
00:58:46,981 --> 00:58:47,982
Turn around.

819
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:50,777
Turn...

820
00:58:53,238 --> 00:58:55,365
Turn around, you bastard!

821
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:09,003
Where's Jeong Sang-hun?

822
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:12,882
Tell me where Jeong Sang-hun is,
you bastard!

823
00:59:15,009 --> 00:59:16,719
-Search his car.
-Yes, ma'am.

824
00:59:21,432 --> 00:59:22,517
-Did you find him?
-Damn it.

825
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:23,893
-No.
-No.

826
00:59:55,633 --> 00:59:58,886
Someone who would cooperate
with Jin Yeong-min to achieve his goal.

827
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:01,097
This is the last time.

828
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:03,099
Your father had the evidence.

829
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:05,184
Find it no matter what.

830
01:00:05,685 --> 01:00:08,313
I have located Jin Yeong-min in Songju.

831
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:11,649
Do you remember
how I was brought to your house?

832
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:15,695
You wanted Chairman Jeong
to go through the pain you experienced.

833
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,948
Did you kill Jeong Sang-hun?

834
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:21,701
Why are you using Sang-hun
to get your revenge?

835
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:25,163
