1
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:41,875
THIS DRAMA IS A WORK OF FICTION.
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,

2
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:45,003
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGIONS, AND INCIDENTS
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:09,069
-Hey, go!
-Pass it over!

4
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:14,407
Pass it to me.

5
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:19,704
-Hey, you can't do that.
-I got this.

6
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:58,868
-This is crazy.
-Is she dead?

7
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:03,623
This is very high.

8
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:29,899
-My gosh.
-Have you checked the rooftop yet?

9
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,193
-I'll go now.
-I don't know her at all.

10
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,279
-Did she jump off the roof?
-I guess so.

11
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:37,407
Jeez, will this be covered by insurance?

12
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:39,200
What's this?

13
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:43,955
LIFE HAS BEEN SO PAINFUL THAT I HAD
NO CHOICE BUT TO DO THIS. FORGIVE ME.

14
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,206
I knew it.

15
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,750
I saw antidepressants at her place.

16
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:50,503
-I wonder what pained her so much.
-Who knows?

17
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:55,049
Did her boyfriend break up with her?
I'd rather live than take my own life.

18
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,344
-Let's go.
-She's so young.

19
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:01,764
Hey, how does insurance work
if this is suicide?

20
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:13,818
CEO JEONG SANG-HUN

21
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,385
Hey.

22
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,013
Jeez, you prick. You scared me.

23
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:44,390
Look at your reflexes.
You still got it.

24
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:46,267
Detective Jo, what...

25
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,146
-Detective Yu!
-Now that you're a free man,

26
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,106
you need to do something about that face.

27
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,234
Why grimace so much?
Shall I iron your face?

28
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,527
These days,
people tell me that I look cute.

29
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,446
-Hey, give us some drinks.
-Oh, sure.

30
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:00,907
Enjoy.

31
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,494
-Did you actually do this yourself?
-You saw me doing it.

32
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:05,703
Will this kill us?

33
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,747
It'll kill you because it's so damn good.

34
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,041
Hey, what's this?

35
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,335
That's you.

36
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,006
-Is he making fun of me or what?
-It's handsome.

37
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,133
It ruined the whole thing.

38
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:23,304
This is on me.
Please stop by whenever you're in Seoul.

39
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:25,890
Enjoy. Eat as much as you'd like.

40
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,725
Why don't you deliver the food to us?

41
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:30,103
Jeez, that fool.

42
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:34,274
You made that moron
become a decent human being.

43
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:37,944
Why would you want to work
at a substation in the countryside?

44
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:39,237
Here.

45
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:42,782
Anyway, I'm glad we could wrap up
your last case fairly easily.

46
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:47,578
-Are you happy now?
-Yes. Of course I am.

47
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:49,497
What?

48
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,667
Hey, what took you so long?

49
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,252
-What time--
-First, let me drink.

50
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,088
-Hey, why...
-Hey.

51
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:58,381
-What's wrong?
-Hey.

52
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:00,758
Did something happen?

53
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:07,056
What's she doing?

54
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:08,850
I'm sorry.

55
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:12,437
"Dear Tae-sik.

56
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:15,898
Hi, Tae-sik. I'm Jin-gyeong."

57
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,775
-Hey, what are you doing?
-"Tae-sik.

58
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:20,069
It seems like only yesterday
that we first met,

59
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,822
but two years have passed since then.

60
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:24,532
Do you remember?

61
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:28,328
When I first joined the team,
you belittled me like crazy

62
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:31,789
for being a woman,
saying I'm rough around the edges

63
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,125
and ignorant."

64
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,835
I heard you, so get back here.

65
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:39,130
"You always made fun of me
and picked on me,

66
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:41,549
but you took such good care of me."

67
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:43,384
Enough.

68
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:45,511
"I was always so grateful.

69
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,724
-I know you're leaving."
-What's with her?

70
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,101
"Always take care of your health.

71
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:54,354
Thank you for everything."

72
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:56,522
Get back here.

73
00:05:58,524 --> 00:05:59,359
Come here.

74
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:02,445
-Hey.
-Tae-sik, please don't leave us.

75
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,323
-Can we please make him stay?
-What?

76
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:09,410
Captain, can we please make Tae-sik stay?

77
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:10,912
Jin-gyeong. Enough, okay?

78
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:13,664
I'll make him stay.
I won't let him go anywhere.

79
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,083
-Sit down.
-Sit down, please.

80
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,543
I'll teach you a lesson when you sober up.

81
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,629
Pour me a drink, please.

82
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:22,799
Hey, he only has two weeks left.

83
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:26,386
What will you do for the next two weeks
if you're already crying like that?

84
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:30,765
Pour me one first.

85
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:33,935
Eat up.

86
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:35,895
It's good.

87
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,399
How dare you say such a thing to me?

88
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:42,860
What are you so afraid of?

89
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,864
Your reputation collapsing in one blow?

90
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:50,743
-Are you afraid you'd sink to the bottom?
-Enough.

91
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,454
You see,

92
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,249
she'd never take her own life.

93
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,668
You know that too.

94
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:00,336
Don't you feel bad?

95
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:02,922
Don't you even feel guilty?

96
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:04,841
What did you say?

97
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:18,438
It won't change anything.

98
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:28,489
Whether anything changes or not,

99
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,035
I'll do everything in my power.

100
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,832
When did things start to go wrong?

101
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:40,668
What is hidden?

102
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,839
And why did she have to suffer
such a tragedy?

103
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,095
I will find out everything.

104
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:08,404
Sang-hun, wait. Hey!

105
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,741
Sang-hun, what is going on?

106
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,201
Why is Dad so angry?

107
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:16,454
-What did you do?
-Why do you assume I did something?

108
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:31,219
Are you seeing another woman?

109
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,013
What did you say?

110
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,933
If that is the case,
just be honest with me.

111
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:40,645
-Let's talk another time.
-When?

112
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:45,900
-I'll call you.
-When?

113
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,117
You won't call me.

114
00:08:56,953 --> 00:09:00,248
Goodness, you always know everything.

115
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:01,958
I only had a sip of alcohol,

116
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,460
when I was having dinner
with Dae-yong and Jin-gyeong.

117
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:09,549
By the way, you'll be so bored
when you transfer here.

118
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:12,301
Gosh, it's not like
there are no bad guys there.

119
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:16,597
Ma'am, I really enjoyed
the kimchi you made!

120
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,015
Is that your captain?

121
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:20,977
Tell him that I'll keep
sending him kimchi.

122
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:24,689
-I love you!
-Jeez, get off me.

123
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:29,652
Don't forget to take your medications.
I'll call you again soon.

124
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:33,239
All right. Don't drive, okay?

125
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:34,615
All right, I won't.

126
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:46,544
I heard treating colon cancer is
as easy as treating a cold these days.

127
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,130
You prick.

128
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:54,093
Get back inside.
I said, get your ass back inside.

129
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:55,595
What's wrong with her?

130
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,930
-Come here.
-Why?

131
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:02,768
Captain, don't be mean to me.

132
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:12,612
The phone is turned off.

133
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:16,782
JEONG SANG-HUN

134
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,909
The phone is turned off.

135
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:55,655
HAND

136
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,574
Are there any security cameras around?

137
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,702
This area is so remote.
There are no cameras within a 1km radius.

138
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:04,955
-Maybe another car crashed into it.
-No, it doesn't seem so at all.

139
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,166
Tae-sik.

140
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,714
Hey, what time is it now?

141
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,092
It's 5:30 a.m.

142
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:18,552
-Who's the victim?
-Kim Seung-cheol.

143
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:20,429
Oh, the singer?

144
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:22,515
No, the assemblyman.

145
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,433
The Liberal Democratic Party.

146
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,352
The one who was most likely to run for--

147
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:27,770
-That politician.
-Be careful.

148
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,360
Oh, no dashcam?

149
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:37,363
I heard politicians in Yeouido
don't have dashcams in their cars.

150
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:40,408
He really doesn't have one.
The GPS unit is shattered.

151
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,535
There are no security cameras around.

152
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:45,663
Where should we begin?

153
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,666
Hey! Who stepped on this?

154
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,001
Not us. It was left like that
when we got here.

155
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,962
Someone obviously stepped on it.

156
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:55,840
-You took photos, right?
-Yes, I did.

157
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:59,510
At every scene, there's always someone
who makes such a thoughtless blunder.

158
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:03,639
What? There are no skid marks.

159
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:06,475
Did he not step on the brakes?

160
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,186
Kim Seung-cheol died instantly.

161
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:11,981
It doesn't look like
another car crashed into it,

162
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:13,858
but I'll go check the camera

163
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:16,110
-that's 1km away--
-Nothing unusual, right?

164
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,280
-Yes.
-Have you eaten?

165
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:22,032
-Sorry?
-What's good in Songju?

166
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:23,701
Breaking news.

167
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:25,494
Assemblyman Kim Seung-cheol

168
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:28,664
died in a car accident last night.
According to the police,

169
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,584
-The phone is turned off.
-he crashed into the pavement

170
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:33,878
on Highway Eight
while driving to Songju

171
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:36,338
-at around 10:55 p.m.
-Why isn't he picking up?

172
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,593
Dad...

173
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:42,970
1 DAY AFTER KIM SEUNG-CHEOL'S DEATH

174
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:45,389
Kim led the pro-democracy movement
in the 80s.

175
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:48,225
His hard work, conscientious endeavors,
and devotion

176
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:51,228
since becoming a politician
earned him many supporters.

177
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,730
Due to Assemblyman Kim's death,

178
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:56,317
a by-election has to be held
in Songju in April.

179
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,111
-Well, he's dead.
-Watch what you say.

180
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:02,448
But considering the situation...

181
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:05,743
Even though Chairman Jeong Yeong-mun
of JQ Group is his in-law,

182
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:08,204
he was always strongly against

183
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,915
family-run conglomerates,
which earned him support

184
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:12,958
from both the ruling
and opposition parties.

185
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,711
Seo-hui must be devastated.

186
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,891
Dad...

187
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,061
No!

188
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,193
Dad?

189
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:41,654
No.

190
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:43,697
Why are you lying there?

191
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,835
I'm sorry I couldn't go
to your son's wedding.

192
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,503
-You got what I sent?
-Yes, I did.

193
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,046
-Take it easy.
-Thank you, sir.

194
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,589
-Get back safely.
-Let's go.

195
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:02,383
I'll be in touch, sir.

196
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:04,093
-What the hell?
-I'm sorry.

197
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,679
Are you kidding me?
Are you really pulling this on me?

198
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:11,308
You said that case would be my last case.

199
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,018
This is really the last one.

200
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,604
Everyone else got pulled into
the club case.

201
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,523
I don't care.
I finished my last case.

202
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:19,859
This is really the last one. For real.

203
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,945
It won't take long to wrap up this case.

204
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:26,115
The victim was an assemblyman,
but you just have to make a report.

205
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,241
Then you do it.

206
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:29,702
Jeez. It's hot in here. Come with me.

207
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,538
-I'll...
-What? Why?

208
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:35,124
There are some people
you should meet. Look.

209
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,586
Over there, you see his wife,
his elder daughter, and her husband.

210
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:40,337
Why are you telling me this?

211
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,339
This information will help you. Look.

212
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,758
-Whatever. I saw nothing.
-That's odd.

213
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:48,554
His younger son-in-law isn't here.
He's a real hotshot.

214
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,558
Hey, that's his younger daughter.

215
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,394
-What do you want from me?
-Well, I just...

216
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:58,898
-Interview them for me.
-I said I won't work on the case.

217
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,024
Sir!

218
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:03,569
Look at him trying so hard.

219
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:16,832
I heard you were the last person
who saw Assemblyman Kim.

220
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,376
-Yes.
-Did he tell you where he was headed?

221
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:22,713
No, he didn't.

222
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:24,506
You didn't notice anything unusual?

223
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:28,177
-No.
-Then do you know

224
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,095
if he was on any medication?

225
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,389
No, nothing in particular.

226
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,224
-Any health issues?
-None.

227
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:37,144
Then was he stressed out
about something recently?

228
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:40,564
Did he seem depressed
or emotionally distressed?

229
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,238
I inspected the scene.

230
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:52,785
He was driving at 120km per hour
on a highway in the middle of the night.

231
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:56,121
He wasn't wearing his seat belt,
and he didn't even step on the brakes.

232
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,748
He just drove into the pavement.

233
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,461
-So, I'm thinking--
-You think he took his own life?

234
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,467
My father would never do that.

235
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:12,513
Right, I understand
his family can think like that.

236
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:18,227
This is why we need dashcam footage.

237
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,396
Why do politicians not have
them in their cars?

238
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:23,941
There was no dashcam?

239
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,193
Did he have one?

240
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,740
Hey, where is Kim Seung-cheol's car now?

241
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:36,036
Okay. Call the NFS and ask them
to check the car thoroughly.

242
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:39,331
Jeez, what a hassle.

243
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,668
How are you holding up, sir?
Please say a few words.

244
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:45,295
Are you all right, sir?
Please make a comment.

245
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:48,757
-Please say a few words.
-Just one comment, please.

246
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,606
I'm so sorry for your loss.

247
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:07,026
I don't even know

248
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,486
what to say to console you.

249
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:12,239
I know you're a busy man.

250
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,533
Still, I should be here.

251
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:31,216
You must stay strong at a time like this.

252
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:33,343
-Okay?
-Yes.

253
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,937
-Are you all right?
-Where is Sang-hun?

254
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:45,856
He's away for work.

255
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:50,277
He must've heard the news,
so he'll be here soon.

256
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:09,171
It's been scrapped?

257
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:13,092
I can't believe you let that happen.

258
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:14,802
Tae-sik, I...

259
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:17,012
It really isn't my fault.

260
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:21,058
I clearly told the tow truck driver
to wait for me.

261
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,185
-Okay.
-But when I got back,

262
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:24,978
-he was gone.
-I see.

263
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:31,276
-I thought he went to the NFS, but--
-Jeez. Look. Victim Kim Seung-cheol.

264
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,238
His job and the location and time
of the incident are here.

265
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:36,490
What do I write
for the cause of the accident?

266
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:37,491
-The...
-What?

267
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:39,201
-Well...
-"The car,

268
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,702
which was crucial evidence,

269
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:43,872
got scrapped due to
Detective Kang Jin-gyeong's mistake.

270
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:47,417
Therefore, this case will remain
unsolved." Should I write that?

271
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:50,587
Tae-sik, that is too cruel.

272
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:51,964
Hold on.

273
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:54,299
If this becomes an unsolved case...

274
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,385
How will you earn a living?

275
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,096
-What?
-Do you have any money saved up?

276
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:01,557
Wait, am I getting fired?

277
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,310
Yes. So you'd better pray
with all your heart.

278
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,146
Just get married
if things go well.

279
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,107
I'm not sure
if you can pull that off.

280
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,528
Gosh...

281
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:18,740
I will get married, to you.

282
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:25,414
You punk!

283
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,499
Does this look like a joke to you?

284
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,751
No, I'm not joking. If I get fired,

285
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,087
-I'll really marry you.
-What is wrong with you?

286
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,505
Will you let me get fired?

287
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,549
Jeez, I heard you! Come here.

288
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,510
You have to act like
you're my boss, don't you?

289
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:44,308
All right. Then this is
just between us for now, okay?

290
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:45,475
-Really?
-Yes.

291
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,644
You have to get married
if the higher-ups know.

292
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:48,937
Take it easy.

293
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:53,358
Who are you?

294
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:56,653
I'm Jeon Ho-gyu.
I'm here to help with the hacking case.

295
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,449
When did you get here?

296
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,620
I've been here all day.

297
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:09,082
Then did you overhear
our entire conversation just now?

298
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:11,335
I'm off.

299
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:15,255
Tae-sik, what do we do?

300
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:16,548
Hey.

301
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:21,929
What's your car?

302
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,439
DISTANCE TO EMPTY 293KM

303
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:38,904
When will you pay off your auto loan?

304
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:41,114
I have 56 months left.

305
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:43,617
That means you practically
only own one wheel.

306
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:45,994
I feel so bad.

307
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,624
It's okay.

308
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,960
Tae-sik has done this a few times.

309
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:56,213
He's caused a couple of accidents,
so he'll be careful this time.

310
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,340
-Accidents?
-Shall I get going?

311
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,592
-Okay.
-Then this...

312
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:03,387
Text him that he'd better drive carefully.

313
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,597
-I mean, tell him via the walkie-talkie.
-Go!

314
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,015
Here I go!

315
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:21,780
Let's trust him.

316
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:24,992
How can I? I barely know him.

317
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:26,618
-Where are you going?
-Damn it!

318
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:28,537
Hey! Jeez.

319
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,498
Tae-sik, Ho-gyu is chasing you.
Be careful.

320
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:36,878
Hey!

321
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:39,298
Jeez, that punk.

322
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:41,925
-Stop!
-Be careful. Ho-gyu!

323
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:46,054
Fuck!

324
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:48,598
Hey!

325
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,021
Tae-sik, please stop.

326
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:56,315
Please!

327
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:01,445
The brakes!

328
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,574
-Shit.
-Gosh!

329
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:11,496
Jeez!

330
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:13,749
-Wasn't that so precise?
-Have you gone mad?

331
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:16,376
-Nice.
-What the hell? Do you want to die?

332
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,795
You fool. You made
so much fuss over nothing.

333
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:20,380
Goodness.

334
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,132
-Are you all right?
-My car...

335
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,388
-I almost had a heart attack.
-I knew it.

336
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:30,307
It's simply impossible.

337
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:33,685
Hey, anyone would step on the brakes
if they wanted to live.

338
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:36,480
-Right.
-That results in skid marks like this.

339
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:40,734
They weren't any at the scene.
So he did it intentionally.

340
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:43,779
-We have the answer then, right?
-Hang on.

341
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:46,281
-You think it was suicide?
-Why?

342
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:48,158
You don't think so?

343
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:51,161
Did you use my car to confirm that?

344
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:53,997
Why did you have to reenact it
with my car?

345
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:55,999
It's not like I wanted to do this.

346
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:58,126
If some idiot didn't let the car
get scrapped.

347
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:01,880
Tae-sik, remember that thing? What was it?

348
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:06,635
What did his daughter say to you?
So there was a dashcam in his car?

349
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,261
Maybe she was mistaken.

350
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:11,098
Had there been one,
we could've totally checked the footage.

351
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:16,478
Why would he kill himself
when he was planning to run for president?

352
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:18,438
It's a little...

353
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:20,649
Is it

354
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:24,611
that a wild boar popped out of nowhere?

355
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:27,280
Listen. Let's say it popped out.

356
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:30,200
-You'd cut the wheel sharply in surprise.
-A wild boar?

357
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,202
Over the bush?

358
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:35,664
-Does it have wings, too?
-That's it.

359
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:39,960
He's an old man.
His vision must've been blurry at night.

360
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:41,920
I guess he could've been seeing things.

361
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:49,845
What is this?

362
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:10,740
Now please put your hands
on the body of the deceased.

363
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:14,828
And please say what you'd like to
tell him for the last time.

364
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:22,043
Goodbye and rest in peace.

365
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,337
Dad.

366
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:26,214
Thank you.

367
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:28,925
I love you.

368
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:56,620
It's not like you're going away for good.

369
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:01,458
Still...

370
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:07,464
I was afraid
you'd want to live with me forever

371
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:09,549
without getting married. You know that?

372
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:13,887
You should go.

373
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:17,891
Have a good time with Sang-hun there.

374
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,563
Don't be such a baby.

375
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:26,983
Your mom wouldn't like it.

376
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:29,319
Just go.

377
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,948
Stay healthy.

378
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:35,700
Okay.

379
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,954
And don't work too much.

380
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,122
All right.

381
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,918
-If you have any problem--
-Seo-hui.

382
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:51,841
I'm not going anywhere.

383
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:54,803
I'll stay right here.

384
00:25:58,473 --> 00:25:59,724
So don't worry about me.

385
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:03,687
Just stay healthy
and take good care of yourself.

386
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:10,777
Have a safe trip.

387
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:13,572
Take care.

388
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:30,130
Dad.

389
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:34,634
Have a safe trip. Take care.

390
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,264
I love you, Dad.

391
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,292
JAMSIL BRIDGE, SEOKCHON LAKE, SEONGNAM

392
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:10,045
He had no problem stepping on the brakes.

393
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:12,172
BUSAN, PANGYO, YANGJAE, SEOUL

394
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:13,089
Oh dear.

395
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:18,595
BUSAN, HOENGSEONG, HONGCHEON

396
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,640
He stepped on the brake,
but the car didn't stop.

397
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:25,435
Did the oil leak?

398
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:27,729
Tae-sik,

399
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:29,397
I guess it's thinner.

400
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:33,485
-Thinner?
-The smell has gone away,

401
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:35,195
but it does taste like one.

402
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:37,989
Hey, what does thinner taste like?

403
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:39,866
It stings your nose.

404
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:43,203
I'm pretty sure. But who would
pour thinner on the road?

405
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:48,041
-What do you need thinner for?
-It's used for paintwork.

406
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:49,334
That's not all.

407
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:52,045
It is also used to dilute or remove paint.

408
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:54,339
-Remove?
-Don't you think

409
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:57,008
they look like skid marks?

410
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,970
Exactly. It does look like skid marks.

411
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,474
Did someone remove
Kim's skid marks?

412
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:06,267
Hang on.

413
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:09,604
But his skid marks
should've gone this way.

414
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:12,816
They are in the opposite direction.

415
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:14,984
If it's not Kim's...

416
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:01,906
It could've been a wild boar.

417
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:03,742
What?

418
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:07,245
I don't think

419
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:11,708
it was an accident.

420
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:24,888
2 DAYS AFTER KIM SEUNG-CHEOL'S DEATH

421
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:30,018
I feel truly bad
about Assemblyman Kim Seung-cheol's death,

422
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,729
but to be honest, we've gone through

423
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:35,648
a lot of distress because of him.

424
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,650
Now that the obstacle is gone,

425
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:39,694
we need a new candidate
as soon as possible.

426
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:41,780
This time,

427
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:44,991
we need someone we can bend to our will.

428
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:52,248
People think grafting is

429
00:29:53,082 --> 00:29:56,544
just about attaching some twigs.

430
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:00,548
Sir, isn't this too precious
to give to me?

431
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:05,178
But the grafter must be skilled

432
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:07,806
to keep the main tree intact.

433
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:11,267
I'll make sure to do things right.

434
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,530
I'm flattered that you think
highly of my daughter.

435
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:27,283
-We're grateful, but--
-Please help

436
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:29,828
Assemblyman Kim

437
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:32,497
leave with honor.

438
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:40,046
This is the original I mentioned before.

439
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:43,633
LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY

440
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:47,428
I believe you will

441
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:49,430
manage it well..

442
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:59,232
Assemblyman Kim will be able
to rest in peace, won't he?

443
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:20,128
Jeong Sang-hun?

444
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:22,297
He's Kim Seung-cheol's second son-in-law.

445
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,257
The only son of the chairman of JQ Group.

446
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,175
How would I know his family relations?

447
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:30,179
He kept making calls
right before the accident.

448
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:31,848
And Jeong Sang-hun didn't answer.

449
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:33,892
Was there anything going on?

450
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:36,769
What kind of man
would like his in-law's call?

451
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:38,438
I didn't see him at the funeral.

452
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:39,355
Detective Jo.

453
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:42,859
-Give me money for the repairs.
-What?

454
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:46,404
My car got a lot of scratches
because of your reckless driving.

455
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:47,947
It's not even three months old.

456
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:49,908
The scratches were there already.

457
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,117
Detective Jo.

458
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:53,995
I check my car every day

459
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:56,039
before going to work and leaving work.

460
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:58,499
There were no scratches before.

461
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:00,293
I'm sure you did it.

462
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:02,211
-Hey.
-What?

463
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:03,963
Don't be like this. We're a team.

464
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:06,549
-Detective Jo.
-Hey.

465
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,551
Did you not hear it yet?

466
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:11,763
He asked the Investigation Division
to let you work here for a while.

467
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:15,475
Who said so?

468
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:16,935
Let's keep up the good work.

469
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:22,065
Hey, I got your desk on the sunny side

470
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:23,524
of the office.

471
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:24,859
You will love it.

472
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,113
They are like a pair of blackmailers.

473
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:37,705
He kept making a lot of calls
right before he died.

474
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:41,125
Jeong Sang-hun.

475
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:46,422
She's not even close to being good enough.

476
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,634
She doesn't have
a good academic background,

477
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:51,552
and she's just a cafe owner.

478
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:53,763
Isn't it too unprecedented?

479
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:56,432
She's Kim's child
and the daughter-in-law of JQ Group.

480
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:58,643
It alone attracts
half of the people in Songju.

481
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:01,688
What?

482
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:05,066
How could I...

483
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:07,735
That's how people feel at first.
You must be afraid.

484
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:11,239
But being an assemblyman is no big deal.
Look. Even I'm doing it now.

485
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:14,075
I mean...

486
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,913
No, I don't know anything about politics.

487
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:22,875
And at a time like this--

488
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:26,629
As you know, there'll be
an Assembly by-election soon.

489
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:29,298
Do you want to turn Songju
over to the opposition party?

490
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:33,678
It was just a small town
which supported the opposition,

491
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:37,390
but Assemblyman Kim devoted his life
to turn it into the Songju of today.

492
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:40,476
Now that JQ is moving to Songju,

493
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,437
the whole city is in an uproar.

494
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,273
It'd be a shame
to end things just like this.

495
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:48,526
So we'd like you to carry on the work
left unfinished by your father.

496
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:51,112
It will be something worthwhile.

497
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:53,948
She has a lot to learn.

498
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:57,368
Please help her and guide her well.

499
00:33:57,452 --> 00:34:00,538
Please don't say that.

500
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:02,832
I believe she will be good.

501
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:04,917
But since she's a talent I selected,

502
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:07,462
it's my job
to guide her to the right path.

503
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,714
Please take good care of her.

504
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:11,132
Sure.

505
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:16,679
JQ SONGJU

506
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:18,389
He's on a business trip.

507
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:20,058
A business trip?

508
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:21,768
Where?

509
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:23,269
He's in Germany.

510
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:28,316
He should still come.
His father-in-law just passed away.

511
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:30,359
It must be something important.

512
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:34,280
I heard he went to attend the forum
about a renewable energy business.

513
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:36,199
What time was his flight?

514
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:37,575
Please wait a second.

515
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:42,622
His flight was at 7 p.m. on the 3rd.

516
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:45,374
That's the evening
when Kim died.

517
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:50,088
-I guess you didn't see him leave.
-Pardon?

518
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,757
When a boss goes on a business trip,

519
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:56,385
his secretary usually books a flight
and drives him to the airport, right?

520
00:34:58,262 --> 00:34:59,305
You didn't see him off?

521
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:03,726
Are you sure Jeong Sang-hun
is on a business trip now?

522
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:08,022
It's me.

523
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,566
Check Jeong Sang-hun's records
of entry and exit.

524
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:13,194
Yes. Immediately.

525
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,240
Yeong-min.

526
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:19,909
Are you sure
Sang-hun is on a business trip?

527
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:21,577
Why isn't he still calling me?

528
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:23,538
He must've heard something by now.

529
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,250
The whole country is in an uproar.
How could he not know it yet?

530
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,001
Calm down first.

531
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:31,003
He must have a good reason.

532
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:33,214
Is this about me?

533
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,300
If it is that he's trying to avoid me,

534
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,219
just tell me the truth.

535
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,471
I wish that were the case, Yeong-min.

536
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:43,432
Seo-hui, I don't think that's the case.

537
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:45,434
Yeong-min.

538
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:49,021
I heard Dad didn't have
a dashcam in his car.

539
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:50,565
What?

540
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:53,192
That day, Dad told me he'd meet Sang-hun.

541
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,988
And a few days ago,
I saw them having a huge fight.

542
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,490
It was terrifying.

543
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,535
-I think something's going on.
-Hang on.

544
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:04,495
What do you mean?

545
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,040
Whom do you suspect?

546
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:11,544
Are you all right?

547
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:13,921
I feel like I'm going crazy.

548
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:17,758
Will you tell me
once you get a call from Sang-hun?

549
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,719
Please.

550
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:21,888
Okay.

551
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:38,946
Hey.

552
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,282
Is it you?

553
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:47,872
-What?
-Is it you?

554
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:50,124
-Pardon?
-Are you the one Tae-sik brought in?

555
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,752
Why are you staring at me?

556
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:57,048
-Nothing.
-It's okay. Sit.

557
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:01,385
I heard you used to work at JQ.

558
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:04,430
You do look smart.

559
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:06,098
Yes, well...

560
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:10,102
So many interesting people out there.

561
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:12,146
Like the one who quits a good job

562
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,273
just to be a petty official.

563
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:17,276
And the one who leaves
the Investigation Unit

564
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,278
to work at a substation
in the countryside.

565
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,990
-What was your name again?
-It's Jeon Ho-gyu.

566
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:24,283
Is your name Ho-gu?

567
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:26,869
It's Jeon Ho-gyu.

568
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:28,996
I see. It's Ho-gyu.

569
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:31,457
I heard you want to go
to Information Division.

570
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,210
-Yes.
-I see.

571
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:37,046
Just make sure to finish this case well.

572
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:38,381
Then you'll be transferred.

573
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:42,051
The case may seem like a big deal,
but it's actually not.

574
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:45,846
Once you do a good job
with a huge case like this,

575
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,974
you can make a good impression

576
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:49,976
on your superiors.

577
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:52,812
-Are you serious?
-Sure.

578
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:57,525
Then it will just be smooth sailing.
There will be no stop sign.

579
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:01,237
This is the perfect timing.

580
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:02,488
Stay seated.

581
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:09,287
What are you doing?

582
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:13,374
DEPARTURE RECORD

583
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:17,169
Do you need help?

584
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:18,587
Take a look at this.

585
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:20,756
Find Jeong Sang-hun.

586
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,466
-Jeong Sang-hun?
-Yes.

587
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,058
Mom, what was all that about?

588
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,810
You should've refused him.

589
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:34,437
Why would I be an assemblywoman?

590
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,440
We'll take care of everything.
Just do as you're told.

591
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:38,816
Mom.

592
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:40,860
Do you

593
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:43,946
not know why Sang-hun is not showing up?

594
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:46,574
When your dad was alive,

595
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:47,908
he could protect you

596
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:50,453
and make up for what you lack.

597
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:51,996
What do you have now?

598
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:55,666
Sang-hun is the best thing
you've done in your life.

599
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,209
Pull yourself together.

600
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:00,296
You were going to move in with him
in Songju long ago.

601
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:02,798
Is it...

602
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:07,720
Are you sure he's not keeping
his distance from you on purpose?

603
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:11,432
Please stop.
I'm a human being. And I'm your daughter.

604
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,142
Yes, I'm worried about you.

605
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,817
Why was he driving alone late at night?

606
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:27,323
People say they admire
his integrity only when he's alive.

607
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:29,492
But now that he's dead,

608
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:31,744
they only try to find fault with him.

609
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:34,205
Do you think

610
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:37,875
your dad had a flawless life?

611
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:40,252
What do you mean?

612
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:42,088
It means

613
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:45,007
there's no time for us
to be sentimental like this.

614
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:48,219
We have to figure out how we will survive.

615
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:51,347
So make sure to keep Sang-hun with you.

616
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:00,523
There's no departure record?

617
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:03,192
No, he didn't leave
the country on the 3rd.

618
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,236
On top of that, there's no record of him

619
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:07,488
leaving at all
after he came back to Korea.

620
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10,449
I can't reach him.
And he's not at his house.

621
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:13,285
So, on the day when Kim Seung-cheol died,
Jeong Sang-hun

622
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:15,079
turned off his phone and disappeared.

623
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,374
And he didn't show up
at his father-in-law's funeral?

624
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:25,423
-What's so funny?
-Hey.

625
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:29,510
A man keeps calling his son-in-law,
but he suddenly dies in an accident.

626
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:31,720
His son-in-law lies
about a business trip

627
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:33,431
and goes off the radar that day.

628
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:38,269
The phone is turned off.

629
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:39,437
That night,

630
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,440
if Kim Seung-cheol was indeed on his way
to see Jeong Sang-hun,

631
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:45,109
he must've run out of the oil.

632
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:47,445
So the brakes wouldn't have worked
no matter what.

633
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,989
He didn't put on his seat belt.

634
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:14,346
But a car came head-on
toward his car out of nowhere

635
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,807
where there were no security cameras.

636
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:42,458
I yelled asking who stepped
on the glasses.

637
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:44,376
-Right.
-He didn't put on his seatbelt.

638
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,170
And his airbag didn't go off, either.

639
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:48,172
On top of that, his dashcam disappeared.

640
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:49,965
There are too many coincidences.

641
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:53,511
If there was someone else at the scene,

642
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:56,597
that person was probably
behind everything.

643
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,517
So are you saying that the culprit is...

644
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:19,036
What? Jeong Sang-hun?

645
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,664
-You, moron. Damn it.
-Come on.

646
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:24,291
Do you expect me
to not get pissed off right now?

647
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,126
I told you to make a report. But what?

648
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,170
It wasn't an accident, but a murder?

649
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:31,507
-And you have whom as your suspect?
-I told you.

650
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:34,468
Rigged vehicle, destroyed evidence,
and a missing person.

651
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:36,512
Those are the leads.

652
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:40,057
I don't want leads.
I want evidence. Evidence. Got that?

653
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:43,394
What if Jeong Sang-hun shows up
several days later?

654
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:45,646
What will you do then? Damn it.

655
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:47,731
Hey, hey.

656
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:50,067
Listen. Don't you know that
by going after him,

657
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:52,194
you're going
after something bigger than him?

658
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:54,029
You'll be going after JQ.

659
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:56,365
Going after Jeong Sang-hun means
going after JQ.

660
00:42:57,324 --> 00:43:00,327
Don't make such a big deal out of it
when you can't handle it.

661
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:02,788
Right?
Since I can't handle the consequence,

662
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:05,332
wouldn't I be better off
going to my mom instead?

663
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:08,377
I'll hand this over to Jin-gyeong.

664
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:09,587
Help her out.

665
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:13,048
She should take on a big case, too.
She has the promotion exam.

666
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:14,800
You mean you'll pursue it as murder?

667
00:43:14,883 --> 00:43:17,553
I'll help out until the end of the week.
And I'm done here.

668
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:20,264
-Hey, hold on. I just have one question.
-No.

669
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:24,518
Why would Jeong kill his father-in-law?
There must be a motive for murder.

670
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,438
I should tell her to look into that
starting now.

671
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:29,982
Hey.

672
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:33,444
He's ditching us
after giving us a load of crap.

673
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:35,154
You instated your son-in-law

674
00:43:35,237 --> 00:43:37,740
for a new business in Songju,
that government supports.

675
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:39,617
How could you be shameless?

676
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:43,078
If my son-in-law truly becomes
the CEO of the new business,

677
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:44,163
I will be the first--

678
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:47,499
Let me tell you about the new business
they're talking about.

679
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:49,084
The government...

680
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:53,172
Give me a second.

681
00:43:54,256 --> 00:43:56,133
It's a public-private partnership.

682
00:43:56,216 --> 00:43:57,801
A new renewable energy project

683
00:43:57,885 --> 00:44:00,471
led by the government
and invested by a private company.

684
00:44:00,554 --> 00:44:01,764
Right. But--

685
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:04,183
In other words, they're trying
to build power plants

686
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:07,144
such as solar and wind energy plants
on a large scale

687
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:09,355
in Songju, Kim Seung-cheol's district.

688
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:12,149
-Right. So--
-JQ will be investing in that business.

689
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:13,651
Hey, do you remember this?

690
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:15,778
I paid a lot of money for this.

691
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,697
-It's yours.
-Really?

692
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:20,199
-Of course.
-Thank you.

693
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:22,159
-Of course.
-I really wanted to have this.

694
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:23,160
But what?

695
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:25,954
-But--
-But...

696
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:30,459
But he was strongly against his son-in-law

697
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:32,961
becoming the CEO of the business.

698
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:36,173
So this punk disregarded all of that.

699
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:38,634
Out of the blue, he became the CEO.

700
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:41,470
But when he did,
that was the talk of the town.

701
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:43,472
People at JQ also talked a lot about this.

702
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:45,265
People said Jeong was incompetent

703
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:47,643
and wondered
if there was something wrong with him.

704
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:49,728
I get why there were rumors though.

705
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:51,480
He was the only son, but instead of

706
00:44:51,563 --> 00:44:54,817
-taking over JQ, he lived abroad.
-So that incompetent son-in-law

707
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,777
got the job thanks to his father-in-law.

708
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:58,320
When these rumors circulated,

709
00:44:58,404 --> 00:45:00,364
it was a green light
for his election.

710
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:01,532
You mean, red light.

711
00:45:03,158 --> 00:45:07,287
Anyway, the point is that this would
have infuriated Kim Seung-cheol, right?

712
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:08,288
I see.

713
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:10,708
Okay. I got it. Everything makes sense.

714
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:14,128
Then shouldn't Kim have killed Jeong?

715
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:16,171
Why would Jeong kill him?

716
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:18,757
Kim should have killed Jeong.
Oh, you're right.

717
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:19,842
"Oh, you're right"?

718
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:22,928
Gosh. And I thought
things were going so smoothly.

719
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:24,930
Smarty-pants.

720
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:27,850
Did you hear anything else from JQ?

721
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:28,892
Right.

722
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:31,979
I did hear a rumor about his wife.

723
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:34,982
I heard that they were separated

724
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:37,735
or Jeong Sang-hun
had a mistress in Songju.

725
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:39,361
Something like that.

726
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:42,156
It has been four days
since the death of Assemblyman Kim.

727
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:44,908
The citizens have voluntarily
set up altars of incense.

728
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:47,995
And the whole country
is in mourning for the tragedy.

729
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,913
People from young students

730
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:51,832
to elders are deeply saddened

731
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:55,377
by the sudden death
of Assemblyman Kim Seung-cheol.

732
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:58,046
This is Kim Ha-neul reporting from OCS.

733
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:02,176
SANG-HUN: I'M SORRY

734
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:07,347
SANG-HUN: I'M SORRY

735
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:11,018
What do you mean by this?

736
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:23,071
Hello.

737
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:25,282
What brings you here?

738
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:27,451
I just had a few questions
about your father.

739
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:32,206
Do you know about the new business
your father was doing?

740
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:35,292
He was going to build
the industrial complex in Songju.

741
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:39,463
Do you not know about it?

742
00:46:41,006 --> 00:46:41,840
No.

743
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:47,346
Then, you must know how your husband
became the CEO of the business.

744
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:50,974
No, I don't know much about his business.

745
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:53,310
So you don't know.

746
00:46:54,686 --> 00:46:55,687
What should I do?

747
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:57,940
How about this?

748
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:02,027
Well, can I get something to drink first?

749
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:30,180
INTRODUCTION TO ENERGY

750
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:38,939
Hello?

751
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:43,110
What are you doing there?

752
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:46,113
There are a few books on the new business.

753
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:47,739
Let's talk outside.

754
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:49,199
This was my father's study.

755
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:51,702
Right.
That's why I came in.

756
00:47:52,786 --> 00:47:55,622
You told me that you didn't know anything
about his business.

757
00:47:56,456 --> 00:47:57,499
Please leave this room.

758
00:47:59,459 --> 00:48:01,420
You kept saying "I don't know."

759
00:48:01,503 --> 00:48:04,256
I can't even look at these books.
Then, how do I investigate?

760
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:06,300
Investigate what?

761
00:48:08,343 --> 00:48:09,469
Investigate whom?

762
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:13,390
How can you ask me that first?

763
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:18,103
Why? Is there someone
you want me to investigate for you?

764
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,776
Your husband didn't come
to the funeral.

765
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:28,822
-He's on a business trip.
-That's not true.

766
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:31,408
I checked
with the Immigration Office.

767
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:35,954
After returning to Korea four months ago,
he never left the country.

768
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:40,792
Are you telling me
that my husband is in Korea?

769
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:44,254
Where is he now?

770
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:46,798
You shouldn't be asking me that.

771
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:50,969
I heard your father
and Jeong didn't get along.

772
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:53,722
Why are you so surprised?

773
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:57,392
I saw the news. They were in a conflict
because of the new business.

774
00:48:58,644 --> 00:49:02,314
But I doubt that it was only
because of the new business.

775
00:49:03,982 --> 00:49:04,816
Was it

776
00:49:06,568 --> 00:49:07,402
because of you?

777
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:10,072
What are you implying right now?

778
00:49:10,822 --> 00:49:12,616
-Leave now.
-Why...

779
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:15,869
Why are you separated?

780
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:19,498
You moved to Germany after marriage.

781
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:22,000
But you returned a year ago
by yourself.

782
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:23,877
And Jeong came back
four months ago.

783
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:26,463
Even after he came back,
you still lived separately.

784
00:49:26,546 --> 00:49:28,882
He lives in Songju.
And you live here.

785
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:32,177
Well, that was because

786
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:34,554
-he was busy with work.
-I heard

787
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:36,556
several rumors going around.

788
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:39,518
Rumor has it that your husband

789
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:42,688
is seeing another woman.

790
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:45,315
Watch your tongue.

791
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:47,192
We can talk outside this room.

792
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:55,492
-What is that?
-What?

793
00:49:56,451 --> 00:49:57,452
Move.

794
00:49:58,286 --> 00:49:59,621
Out of my way.

795
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:05,252
Is this

796
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:08,588
blood?

797
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:12,342
Whose blood is this?

798
00:50:16,221 --> 00:50:17,597
Must I call in the KCSI?

799
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:20,642
That's my husband's blood.

800
00:50:21,643 --> 00:50:24,354
My husband was helping
my father move his desk

801
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:27,024
and bumped himself
into the corner of the desk.

802
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:30,569
You're good at playing innocent,
but not at lying.

803
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:34,698
It's obvious that this didn't come
from the desk.

804
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:38,118
I can tell it was
from getting hit by an object.

805
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:41,455
What is it?

806
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:45,876
Did your father throw
this book at your husband?

807
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:50,213
-I told you that wasn't true.
-Ms. Kim.

808
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:52,549
I don't think
you know the situation.

809
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:55,886
We found a lead
that your father's vehicle was rigged.

810
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:59,514
And we also found traces
of someone else being at the scene.

811
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:00,849
Do you know what it means?

812
00:51:02,267 --> 00:51:03,560
Your father

813
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:05,729
did not die in an accident.

814
00:51:06,813 --> 00:51:07,898
He was murdered.

815
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:12,027
Jeong Sang-hun...

816
00:51:14,112 --> 00:51:14,946
Where is he now?

817
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:07,165
HO-GYU

818
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:11,419
What is it?

819
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:13,672
This is Ho-gyu. I got it.

820
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:15,340
-I located him.
-Go ahead.

821
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:19,094
You should write this down.
The last phone call by Jeong Sang-hun--

822
00:52:19,177 --> 00:52:22,013
Okay. Hold on a second.

823
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:27,394
-Go ahead.
-The call was made at 6 p.m.

824
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:29,563
on the day of Kim's death
around the scene.

825
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:32,566
It was at 6 p.m. on March 3rd.

826
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:35,443
The plate number is 86N 7360.

827
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:37,821
Okay, 86N 7360.

828
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:38,864
Yes.

829
00:52:56,298 --> 00:52:57,215
Mr. Jeong,

830
00:52:57,966 --> 00:52:59,843
thank you for attending the funeral.

831
00:52:59,926 --> 00:53:02,053
Please don't mention it.

832
00:53:03,138 --> 00:53:05,307
It's the least I could do.

833
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:08,226
By the way,

834
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:11,396
I would like to see my son-in-law today.

835
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:14,608
I guess you still
haven't reached Sang-hun yet.

836
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:18,737
Yes.

837
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:40,508
Here it is.

838
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:41,885
URBAN SAFETY CENTER

839
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:43,929
Could you zoom in the footage?

840
00:53:45,805 --> 00:53:46,890
86N 7360.

841
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:49,267
That's Jeong Sang-hun.

842
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:52,229
Please keep playing the footage.

843
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:57,400
Wait.

844
00:53:57,817 --> 00:53:59,402
Can you replay the part just now?

845
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:02,864
Stop.

846
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:17,212
Late Assemblyman Kim Seung-cheol

847
00:54:17,295 --> 00:54:19,881
maintained the balance of our society.

848
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:23,218
The spirit of the reformation
he strived for

849
00:54:23,301 --> 00:54:24,552
must be kept alive

850
00:54:25,136 --> 00:54:28,848
by us regardless of
which party we belong to.

851
00:54:29,557 --> 00:54:30,558
Please

852
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:37,065
rest in peace now, Seung-cheol.

853
00:54:37,148 --> 00:54:40,568
KIM SEUNG-CHEOL'S MEMORIAL SERVICE
WE WON'T FORGET YOU

854
00:54:45,031 --> 00:54:47,993
A eulogy poem will be read next.

855
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:50,912
Seo-hui.

856
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:53,832
It's better if you read it.

857
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:56,084
Me?

858
00:55:17,188 --> 00:55:19,316
Kim Seo-hui was the last one

859
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:21,401
to see Jeong Sang-hun?

860
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:31,453
"As you silently embraced us

861
00:55:32,954 --> 00:55:35,540
with your profound feelings of love

862
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:37,834
for a long time,

863
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:43,298
you had grown thin like the branch.

864
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:49,387
As I admire a flower petal,
happily fluttering away

865
00:55:50,805 --> 00:55:53,141
in the fleeting breeze,

866
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:56,895
my yearning for you

867
00:55:58,605 --> 00:56:00,398
pierces through

868
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:04,319
my heart

869
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:07,864
today.

870
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:13,453
Please be the wind.

871
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:18,124
Please let there be
a memory of love in the wind.

872
00:56:20,668 --> 00:56:22,921
My yearning brings back my father.

873
00:56:25,298 --> 00:56:27,050
You aspired to live a more honest

874
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:31,262
and better life.

875
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:38,770
I will remember you until the end of time.

876
00:56:41,773 --> 00:56:45,193
Please leave behind all the troubling
and painful memories

877
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:47,862
in this life.

878
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:52,826
Take only happy
and heartwarming memories."

879
00:56:58,456 --> 00:56:59,874
-What's going on?
-Are you okay?

880
00:57:14,889 --> 00:57:15,849
What's going on?

881
00:57:16,558 --> 00:57:18,017
Mom!

882
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:20,728
Step aside.

883
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:47,630
Sang-hun.

884
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:01,186
Sang-hun.

885
00:58:03,855 --> 00:58:04,981
Sang-hun!

886
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,373
Sang-hun!

887
00:58:56,783 --> 00:59:00,370
5 DAYS AFTER KIM SEUNG-CHEOL'S DEATH

888
00:59:19,305 --> 00:59:21,849
-I think it is Sang-hun's hand.
-That can't be.

889
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:23,768
Is Sang-hun alive?

890
00:59:23,851 --> 00:59:25,562
Are you sure it's Jeong Sang-hun's?

891
00:59:26,187 --> 00:59:27,605
What did they do here?

892
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:29,899
Isn't that Kim?

893
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:32,569
The police are looking for him, too.

894
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:35,280
This all started because of you.

895
00:59:36,155 --> 00:59:39,450
Do you know who harmed
your father and your husband?

896
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:40,618
You want to find him?

897
00:59:40,702 --> 00:59:42,579
I am announcing my candidacy...

898
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:45,665
Locate her right now. Request for backup.

899
00:59:47,792 --> 00:59:49,794
