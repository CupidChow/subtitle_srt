1
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:41,958
THIS DRAMA IS A WORK OF FICTION.
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,

2
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:45,086
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGIONS, AND INCIDENTS
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:11,696
Father.

4
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:19,287
I couldn't turn a blind eye to it
any longer.

5
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:21,664
Well, I didn't want to.

6
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,252
I'll help you.

7
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:28,922
Thank you.

8
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:35,095
All right, let's go inside.

9
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:38,473
SONGJU

10
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:41,142
This is a lot bigger than I thought.

11
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,436
I didn't think it'd be this huge.

12
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,980
We must reveal this to the world.

13
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:49,984
It won't be easy.

14
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,904
Those people will do whatever it takes

15
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:55,448
to stop us.

16
00:01:57,742 --> 00:01:58,868
Yes, they will.

17
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:07,460
BAIT

18
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,107
Sang-hun?

19
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:32,527
Sang-hun.

20
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:36,072
Mr. Kim Pil-yeon?

21
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,320
Is that you, Sang-hun?

22
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,572
Is that you over there?

23
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:36,174
No.

24
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,509
No!

25
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:41,012
Sang-hun.

26
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,101
No!

27
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:56,694
-No!
-What was that?

28
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:57,904
No!

29
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,574
No, please!

30
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:04,869
No!

31
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:08,164
No!

32
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,043
No!

33
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,851
-Enough.
-No!

34
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:29,978
I said, enough.

35
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:32,730
Let's go.

36
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,400
No, wait!

37
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:45,451
Ms. Kim, how did you find out
that he'd be here?

38
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,415
What is your relationship with the victim?

39
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,460
Hey, wait. Just a second.

40
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:58,756
Damn it.

41
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:04,095
-Hey, where is Jeong Sang-hun?
-He's not here.

42
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:07,765
We searched every single container
but didn't even find his hair.

43
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,393
This is crazy.

44
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,479
Guys, search every building
within a 5km radius--

45
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,398
Forget it.

46
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:18,776
Search every corner of Ansan
and find Jeong Sang-hun. Get moving!

47
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,986
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

48
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:25,116
Excuse me. Just a moment.

49
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,160
-Mr. Kim Pil-yeon.
-Ma'am.

50
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:28,828
-Mr. Kim.
-Ma'am, please.

51
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:30,413
-Mr. Kim.
-You can't do this.

52
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:32,540
-Please step back.
-Get up. Get up!

53
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:34,751
Wake up! You said you'd tell me.

54
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,045
-You said you'd tell me.
-Let me talk to her.

55
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:38,504
-Ms. Kim.
-Wake up!

56
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,631
-Enough. Please!
-Let go.

57
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,258
-Stop.
-No, I have to wake him up.

58
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,551
-Just a second.
-He's dead.

59
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:47,221
He can't die like that.
Just a second. Wait!

60
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:48,890
-Please.
-Wait!

61
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:52,101
He said he'd tell me where Sang-hun is
and that it wasn't his doing.

62
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,270
-What do you mean?
-He said he'd tell me

63
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,356
who took Sang-hun and where he is now.

64
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,899
Kim Pil-yeon said that to you?

65
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,027
Is Sang-hun going to be okay?

66
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:02,862
It wasn't my doing.

67
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:04,614
Bring 50 million won.

68
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:05,990
If you do as I say,

69
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,326
I'll tell you who did it
and why it happened.

70
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,204
I'll tell you everything.

71
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:15,458
Don't forget. You must come alone.

72
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:17,877
What do I do now?

73
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,297
Is Sang-hun going to be okay?
What should I do?

74
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:23,966
Detective Jo, what do I do now?

75
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,386
Please help me, Detective Jo.

76
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:29,180
How am I going to save Sang-hun now?

77
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,858
-I heard you asked for me, sir.
-Yes.

78
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:45,363
What do you think?

79
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,953
Do you think Kim Pil-yeon
really took his own life?

80
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:58,126
Is there someone
you're suspicious of, sir?

81
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,294
Yeong-min.

82
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:01,963
Yes, sir.

83
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,132
Find out

84
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,427
what Mr. In was up to

85
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,263
on the day when Sang-hun went missing.

86
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,061
I want

87
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,439
an hourly breakdown of what he ate,

88
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:21,190
where he went,

89
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:25,736
and whom he met that day.
Find out everything.

90
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,031
I'm sure that punk

91
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,368
is plotting something behind my back.

92
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,330
He's hiding something.

93
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:52,138
What's with those sad eyes?

94
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,726
People might think you were fond of him.

95
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:00,146
Let's see.

96
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:03,107
Cyanide, nitrate, alkaloid...

97
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,735
The toxicology report seems fine.

98
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:08,779
And no wounds left from defending himself.

99
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:10,323
So he took his own life?

100
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:12,783
According to this, yes.

101
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,453
Look. It's pretty bad, isn't it?

102
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:17,622
It's from before he died.

103
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,416
Do you see all the scrapes and wounds?

104
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:24,045
They're a few days old.
I'll show you this too.

105
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:33,012
Someone broke his ankle.

106
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,226
This prick...

107
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,270
This is confusing me.

108
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,027
-What do you want to drink?
-Give me the big one.

109
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,992
Dozens of police officers
searched every corner of Ansan.

110
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,160
And we found nothing.

111
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,996
-Did you find anything?
-No, sir.

112
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:00,957
This is for you guys.

113
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,750
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

114
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,877
Keep searching. Go on.

115
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:07,004
-Keep it up.
-Yes, sir.

116
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:12,218
Hey, what if that bastard
really buried him somewhere?

117
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:15,179
I mean, why not? If he was going to
kill himself.

118
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,308
Do you also believe
that Kim Pil-yeon took his own life?

119
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,477
He hanged himself,
so it's obviously suicide.

120
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,272
He told her that the real culprit
is someone else, so why?

121
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:25,731
Why suddenly kill himself?

122
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,568
Have you ever seen a criminal
admitting he is a criminal?

123
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:31,279
He obviously hanged himself
because he felt cornered.

124
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:32,863
There are no signs of homicide.

125
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:36,325
But I think he fought with someone.
He was beaten up pretty badly.

126
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,994
His ankle is broken.

127
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:41,080
Hey, that's not important now.

128
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:45,167
Jeong Yeong-mun has been calling the chief
of the National Police Agency every day,

129
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,669
asking about his son's case.

130
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:50,798
We might end up on the chopping block
before we can find Jeong Sang-hun.

131
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:51,757
Sure.

132
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:56,262
-Shall I go ask a fortune-teller?
-Don't be silly. Just keep on looking.

133
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,055
You go that way.

134
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:02,476
This is driving me nuts.

135
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:09,483
Hello. Have you seen this man
by any chance?

136
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,068
-No, I haven't.
-Never?

137
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:33,799
THE REED FIELD WITH SANG-HUN

138
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:53,235
It's me.

139
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:55,488
Are you all right?

140
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:57,490
Seo-hui.

141
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,117
Quit the campaign.

142
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:04,538
It's the right thing to do.
You're distraught now.

143
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,876
I don't know why you suddenly decided
to announce your candidacy,

144
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,003
but you don't have to listen to Mr. Hong.

145
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:13,673
I know that your father
wouldn't have wanted it either.

146
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,676
But Mr. Kang--

147
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:19,512
You're struggling
to even pull yourself together.

148
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:22,306
I'll sort everything out.

149
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:26,102
What? She wants to resign?

150
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:30,272
Is it because she's stupid?
She clearly can't gauge the situation.

151
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,482
You're out of line, sir.

152
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:33,734
Then she shouldn't have agreed to do it.

153
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,778
What are we going to do
if she quits?

154
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:39,532
Does she not care about the party at all?
We're totally screwed.

155
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,450
I'm sure she knows all of that.

156
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,744
She just can't be campaigning
at the moment.

157
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:46,664
-Even holding herself together--
-Be quiet!

158
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:48,666
You need to know when not to butt in!

159
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:51,502
I'm already fuming mad,
so don't get on my nerves.

160
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:53,838
I don't care if you have to drag her here.

161
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:55,005
Just bring her to me.

162
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,049
Actually, no. Where is she? I'll go--

163
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,136
I'm sorry.

164
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,388
I'm a little late.

165
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:06,183
My gosh, Ms. Kim.
We're all human after all.

166
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:09,603
Don't push yourself too hard.
You should've rested.

167
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:12,231
Have a seat. Please sit.

168
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:15,693
Do you know of
any good medicinal clinics in Songju?

169
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:17,445
She'll faint at this rate.

170
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:20,197
-What do I need to do first?
-You don't even need to ask.

171
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,992
We've already arranged everything for you.

172
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,410
You just need to be there.

173
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:26,370
-You called Mr. Choi, right?
-Yes, sir.

174
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:30,332
He'll secure
at least 10,000 votes for you,

175
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,252
so all you need to do today
is meet Mr. Choi

176
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:34,712
and have a meal with him.

177
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:44,513
-Hello, ma'am.
-How can I help you?

178
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:46,182
I'm here to look at your house.

179
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,309
-But we're not selling our house.
-Excuse me.

180
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:50,644
Wait. I told you
that we're not selling our house.

181
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,062
Isn't it for sale?

182
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,731
No, it's not.

183
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:56,233
That's odd.
The realtor said that it is.

184
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,235
The realtor was probably confused.

185
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,696
Get out. Leave, please.

186
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,198
Do you live here alone, ma'am?

187
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:05,576
-Yes, I do. Please leave now.
-I see.

188
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:08,788
-But if you live alone, why--
-No! Don't open that door.

189
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,123
Don't. Please leave.

190
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:12,792
Gosh, I told you to leave!

191
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:18,297
Wait! Leave, please.

192
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,801
There is nothing to see.

193
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,427
Wait. My gosh.

194
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:26,680
Ma'am, didn't you say that you live alone?

195
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:30,226
Well, my grandson visited me.

196
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,436
-Please leave now.
-I see, your grandson.

197
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:34,396
Who? Mr. Kim Pil-yeon?

198
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,358
-Well...
-He was hiding here, wasn't he?

199
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,361
No, I don't know anyone by that name.

200
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:42,404
Come on. Don't lie.

201
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:46,283
I saw you pouring soju
and lighting the cigarette earlier.

202
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:48,410
Well...

203
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:51,497
Ma'am, you have to be honest with me.

204
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,166
You know what he did.

205
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:59,088
What they said on the news is all a lie.

206
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:02,800
He said it was unfair

207
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:06,387
and that someone was trying to kill him.

208
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:10,850
He was scared and felt wronged.
That's all he said before he died.

209
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,857
If only he had made it onto the ship...

210
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,234
Then he would've lived.

211
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:23,946
If only he had made it onto the ship...

212
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:25,906
"The ship," ma'am?

213
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:29,159
Let's have soju.

214
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,036
-Dig in.
-Oh, my.

215
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,165
-Mr. Choi.
-Yes, sir.

216
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:38,043
Please take good care of Ms. Kim.

217
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,380
Knowing how influential you are in Songju,

218
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:44,174
I bet even a corpse
can win any election.

219
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,595
Gosh, I can't do that!

220
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,972
But I'm sure Ms. Kim

221
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,808
will get plenty of votes
even without my help.

222
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,896
All right. Ms. Kim.

223
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:01,275
-I mean, Assemblywoman Kim.
-That's right.

224
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:02,568
Let me pour you a drink.

225
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:05,404
Gosh, you don't need to get up.
Please sit.

226
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:06,906
You can just use one hand.

227
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,329
All right, everyone.
The daughter of Songju, Kim Seo-hui.

228
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:14,371
Let's go!

229
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,415
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

230
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:31,013
You're brave, unlike Mr. Jeong.

231
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:34,892
You know my husband?

232
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:38,687
I've probably seen him more than
anyone else has since he moved to Songju.

233
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:42,483
My heart breaks
whenever I think about him.

234
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:46,528
-He was such a virtuous, kindhearted man.
-Oh, dear.

235
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:50,658
He should've become a professor
instead of a businessman.

236
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,952
Assemblyman Kim
was a wonderful man as well.

237
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:56,872
That tenderhearted man
died such a tragic death

238
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,375
-because he listened to those commies--
-Enough.

239
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,836
My apologies.
I'm being such a downer.

240
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:07,007
It's all my fault.
I'll take the blame for everything.

241
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,218
All of this happened because I failed

242
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,011
to take care of the labor union.

243
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,763
It's not your fault.

244
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,933
Those bastards are all in the wrong.

245
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:19,937
All they do is try to figure out
how they can leech off others.

246
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:24,108
Under the Chun Doo-hwan administration,
they would've been bulldozed with a tank

247
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:26,860
and dumped into the sea.

248
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,488
There will be no improvement in Songju

249
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:32,074
as long as commies like them
are allowed to wreak havoc.

250
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,575
Totally.

251
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:37,121
Everyone here should support Ms. Kim
to the best of their ability!

252
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:38,205
Sure thing!

253
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:53,721
Look at you, Kim Seo-hui.

254
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:55,639
Did you drink?

255
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:57,933
Yes, a little.

256
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:03,772
Who knew I'd ever see you running
for a seat in the National Assembly?

257
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:07,651
Assemblywoman Kim Seo-hui.

258
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:10,529
Hey, Assemblywoman Kim.

259
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:14,908
It's so weird.

260
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:21,582
I feel the same way.

261
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:23,917
Yeong-min.

262
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,546
I really don't want to do this.

263
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:30,257
Isn't he so cruel?

264
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,051
How could he worry me this much?

265
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:33,927
How?

266
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:36,930
How could he hang me out to dry like this?

267
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:38,724
Sang-hun, that jerk.

268
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:42,352
What a jerk.

269
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,064
He's such a jerk.

270
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,609
I'll teach that prick a serious lesson
when he comes back.

271
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:52,112
You're cursing him nonstop.

272
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,075
Should I tell him?

273
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,371
Sang-hun!

274
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:05,042
Seo-hui says you're cruel.

275
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:08,420
She thinks you're so damn mean.

276
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:12,966
I'm going to teach you a lesson
when I see you.

277
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,970
I hope we can see him soon, Yeong-min.

278
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,692
So he was trying to extort money
from her to get on the ship?

279
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:33,821
-Yes.
-If he was indeed planning to stow away,

280
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:36,406
that means he had no intention
of taking his own life.

281
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:40,702
-Then who killed Kim Pil-yeon?
-The real culprit, probably.

282
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:46,750
On March 3, Kim Seung-cheol died
and Jeong Sang-hun disappeared.

283
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:53,674
And there was a fire in the building
where Kim Pil-yeon was hiding.

284
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:57,594
Grandma!

285
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:00,973
Then he fled to Ansan
at the crack of dawn on the 4th.

286
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:02,391
My gosh.

287
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,227
And he stayed there until the day he died.

288
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,646
He stayed there since the 4th?

289
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,190
The hand and the knife.

290
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:12,776
He couldn't have put them there.

291
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:13,944
That's right.

292
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,574
See? What did I say the other day?

293
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:21,326
How many times did I tell you
that Tae-sik is right?

294
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,411
You never said that.

295
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:25,706
You said he put them there
because he probably has OCD.

296
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,541
Well, in any case...

297
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,294
What was I going to say?

298
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,130
Right. Judging from
what Kim Pil-yeon told her,

299
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:35,132
I think he knew who the real culprit is.

300
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:38,760
Start with people around Kim Pil-yeon.
I'm sure it's someone he knows.

301
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,721
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir. I'm on it.

302
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:45,767
Jeong Sang-hun
or whatever his name is...

303
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,896
I never heard Pil-yeon saying
he knows people in such high places.

304
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:52,524
That's right. That prick probably knew
some gamblers, but that's about it.

305
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:57,905
But didn't he set himself on fire once
to protect the factory?

306
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:00,157
Gosh, that was a long time ago.

307
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:03,535
When all of us were fighting
and suffering injuries,

308
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,495
He didn't even show up.
You all know that.

309
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,831
-Yes.
-I just made this. Try it.

310
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,082
This looks delicious.

311
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,126
By the way, why did Pil-yeon do that?

312
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,670
Life is tough, you know.

313
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:17,049
I wasn't going to bring this up,

314
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:21,220
but do you know how much he brought
to my son's wedding as a gift?

315
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:24,473
He only brought 5,000 won.

316
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,517
What? 5,000 won? Seriously?

317
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:29,102
Yes, seriously.

318
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:32,564
Then how could he afford to gamble?

319
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,442
I heard his wife's butcher shop went bust
because of him.

320
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:37,486
-Really?
-Then where did he get the money?

321
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,529
You should never gamble, period.

322
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,823
-That's right.
-It ruins your life.

323
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,159
I guess there's a gambling den
in this area.

324
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,704
Someone saw it at the fish market.

325
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:50,123
Yes, I heard that too.

326
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,168
-It's horrible.
-Let me fill up your glass.

327
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:56,296
ASSEMBLYMAN KIM SEUNG-CHEOL

328
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:06,348
ALWAYS BY YOUR SIDE, CANDIDATE NUMBER 1

329
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:10,185
-She should look barefaced,
-Okay.

330
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,561
but we can't forgo makeup.

331
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:14,856
People don't like seeing too much makeup
on the eyes and lips.

332
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:18,110
Seo-hui,
you should take your earrings off.

333
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:21,363
People will assume that you spend lavishly
and gossip about it.

334
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:22,823
Okay.

335
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:24,908
-Hello.
-This is Kim Seo-hui of Songju.

336
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,493
My gosh, can I shake your hand?

337
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:28,787
Let's see. You look beautiful.

338
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,372
One, two, three.

339
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:33,792
Your father was a regular here.
Please take a seat. Here.

340
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:39,756
Have as much as you'd like.
Your father always had two bowls.

341
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,633
Thank you, ma'am.

342
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:45,345
Make sure you address everyone
as either "ma'am" or "sir."

343
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:46,763
You'll win the election.

344
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:49,474
When you're shaking hands,
use both hands and be polite.

345
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,310
-Hello.
-Hello.

346
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:55,522
Even if you don't want to, you have to eat
all the foods that people offer you.

347
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:59,067
Refusing such offers
or eating like a bird is so off-putting.

348
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,528
-Try this. Good!
-Eat everything and enjoy it.

349
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:05,949
My gosh, we should shake hands too.

350
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,161
Why are you so startled?

351
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:11,288
-You're just so adorable.
-Please, sir.

352
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:13,665
-Sir.
-You have such a pretty face.

353
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,418
-Can we take a picture with you?
-Just one photo, please.

354
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:21,757
Please allow me to introduce

355
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,260
Ms. Kim Seo-hui, the daughter of Songju.

356
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:30,766
THE CITY FOR EVERYONE, SONGJU
THE BEST CANDIDATE FOR SONGJU

357
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,649
Hello.

358
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:48,241
Well, I'm...

359
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:51,912
Hello,

360
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:54,081
I'm Kim Seo-hui.

361
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,459
Hey.

362
00:22:58,251 --> 00:22:59,086
Did you fart?

363
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:04,883
-This smell isn't from a fart.
-What is this smell?

364
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:06,885
Clean your car, please.

365
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,262
How long has it been?

366
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,056
He went in about an hour ago.

367
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,517
I wonder if he's doing a good job.

368
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:17,771
I'm worried because we sent that kid
all by himself.

369
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,690
Our budget is so little.

370
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:23,860
He's probably spent it all by now.

371
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:25,654
Hey,

372
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:29,866
if you're that worried,
why don't you go in too?

373
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,289
Jeez, I'm out.

374
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:38,458
Gosh, already?

375
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:41,044
I'm sorry. I got two nine cards.

376
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:42,671
Hold on.

377
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:46,591
The ten cards again?

378
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,805
Hey, our stomachs are turning,
so put in extra cream.

379
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:53,974
Sure.

380
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:57,227
Mr. Lee, I need to borrow
some money from you.

381
00:23:57,394 --> 00:24:00,522
You do? Well, let me see.

382
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:02,691
Let's see.

383
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,110
How much have you lost?

384
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:09,698
Oh, boy. The man from Seoul
is crushing you guys today.

385
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:12,159
-How much do you need?
-Three big ones.

386
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:14,578
Three? Hold on.

387
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,789
I guess you're new. Are you new?

388
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:20,041
Yes, this is my first day here.

389
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:23,920
I guess you're from Gyeongsang Province.
I'm from Gyeongsang Province too.

390
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:27,132
What made you come
all the way here to Songju?

391
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:30,010
I'm here hoping to get some tips
from guys like you.

392
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,764
Where are the guys who work at the RMC?

393
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,684
I heard they are generous
when it comes to tipping.

394
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:40,353
RMC? You mean Kim?

395
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:43,273
Hey, don't you even watch the news?

396
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:45,025
He's dead.

397
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:47,444
Why would you talk about a dead man?

398
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:51,781
It just makes me miss
that pushover, Pil-yeon.

399
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:56,161
Pil-yeon, you darn pushover Pil-yeon.

400
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:58,538
Did he come here quite often?

401
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:00,123
He hung around here all the time.

402
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:04,085
He never seemed to run out of money.

403
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,256
I guess he lost a lot of money here.

404
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:11,593
Why are you being so inquisitive?

405
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:15,388
-Never mind. Have some coffee.
-Regional Investigation Unit?

406
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:18,391
-Let me see.
-No, that's not it.

407
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:19,851
-Run, guys!
-No!

408
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:21,520
Darn it!

409
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,731
Go catch them.

410
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:27,567
-You jerk.
-Stop right there.

411
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,110
You idiots.

412
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:30,529
Run!

413
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:32,781
What's going on?

414
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:34,241
Damn it.

415
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:36,660
-Hey!
-Run!

416
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,411
Stop chasing me!

417
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:40,872
-Don't come.
-Stop right there.

418
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:42,165
-You jerk.
-Don't follow.

419
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:43,792
Wait, you punks.

420
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,672
-Get changed and catch up!
-Hey, where's the head?

421
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:49,631
He went that way.

422
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:51,216
Captain.

423
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:53,134
-Hey!
-What?

424
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,095
-Move over.
-He's right there. Hurry.

425
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,430
Go chase him!

426
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:59,975
Move over!

427
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:01,768
-Stop right there.
-Move over.

428
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:04,688
Don't come near me. Stop chasing me!

429
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:06,022
You punk.

430
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:08,233
You jerk...

431
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:11,152
-Don't come near me.
-Catch him.

432
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,154
Just follow him.

433
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:16,658
-Hello.
-Guys, there's a cop.

434
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,285
Stop him.

435
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:20,287
What?

436
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:28,128
Hey!

437
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:31,798
-Keep running.
-Stop, you jerk!

438
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:33,258
Move over.

439
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:36,052
-Hey, where's the banker?
-That way.

440
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:37,178
Hey!

441
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:39,556
You jerk.

442
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:48,523
This way.

443
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:51,651
Stop right there.

444
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:53,695
They're so fast.

445
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:55,822
Just stop running.

446
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:57,741
Stop there.

447
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:02,787
Darn it. Come here.
Just turn yourselves in.

448
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,789
Give yourselves up.

449
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,962
Damn! You darn coward.

450
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:21,806
FOOD WASTE

451
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:35,362
How dare you...

452
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:36,696
Hey.

453
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,783
How dare you touch my butt?

454
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:42,118
Hey, that's enough. What's wrong with you?

455
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:43,078
You idiot.

456
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:44,704
Why are you being like this?

457
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:46,748
-Gosh, my back.
-I should break that wrist!

458
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:47,874
Hey.

459
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:50,960
So are you saying you're a victim?

460
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:53,880
I lent Kim Pil-yeon about 200 million won.

461
00:27:57,884 --> 00:28:00,970
Why did you lend him money
when he didn't even pay you back?

462
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:04,224
Well... That's just...

463
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:08,478
Don't you dare lie to us.

464
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:10,105
I was told to do so.

465
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:11,856
By whom?

466
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:15,360
If I told you that, I'd be dead already.

467
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:24,077
-I'll just beat the crap out of you--
-It's Mr. Choi! The CEO!

468
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:28,039
Mr. Choi?

469
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:30,542
Which Mr. Choi?

470
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:35,046
Mr. Choi Chi-deuk, the CEO of Songju RMC.

471
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:37,507
Choi Chi-deuk?

472
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:39,050
Who's the brat?

473
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:41,094
Songju Times was
the first one to write it.

474
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:43,471
And it spread all over in a day.

475
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,306
Can't you even stop it from happening?

476
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,226
The approval rating has halved
just in a couple of days.

477
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:51,813
The opposition party is busy finding
fault with her. What do we do?

478
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:54,774
I didn't know you'd use
rough words there like that.

479
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:57,527
So you should've worked harder, Ms. Kim.

480
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:00,822
They couldn't dare
to mess with us like this.

481
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:02,365
What do you want me to do then?

482
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:04,784
This isn't her fault though.

483
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:06,244
Yes, it is.

484
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,830
She can't even say her name right.

485
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:12,167
She seems unreliable
even with her father's reputation.

486
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,626
That's why it's happening.

487
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:16,296
We're trying to spoon-feed her,
but she can't take it.

488
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:18,715
I'll try harder, Mr. Hong.

489
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:20,842
I have to win the election. Please help.

490
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:23,219
Please don't worry.
I'll take care of it somehow.

491
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:26,264
Forget it. We have to take care
of that darn reporter first.

492
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:27,599
No, it's Choi Chi-deuk.

493
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:31,102
That stupid idiot didn't even know
there was a reporter.

494
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,646
-Call Mr. Choi immediately.
-Yes, sir.

495
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,523
I'm so sorry.

496
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:38,777
I should've been more thorough.

497
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:43,573
I'll find some salable reporters
to water it down.

498
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:46,951
Yes. Please take care. Okay.

499
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:49,287
Darn it. I'm screwed.

500
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:53,917
-Sorry. I'm getting a lot of complaints.
-No problem.

501
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,169
You seem really busy.

502
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,004
Well, yes. How may I help you?

503
00:29:58,797 --> 00:29:59,672
Why did you lie?

504
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:01,633
What did I lie about?

505
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:03,551
Kim Pil-yeon.

506
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:07,847
You said you have nothing to do with him.
Apparently, he got tons of money from you.

507
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:10,558
It's not like I gave him money.

508
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:12,477
He was in urgent need of money,

509
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,271
so I lent him some.
That's something you can do out of pity.

510
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:17,565
Stop talking nonsense.

511
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:22,111
You led the banker by the nose
to watch on Kim Pil-yeon's every move.

512
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:24,113
Mr. Choi.

513
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:27,158
What did you do that night?

514
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:29,786
The night Kim Pil-yeon died.

515
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:34,666
Kim...
Kim Pil-yeon died?

516
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:39,712
Where's your clicker?
Turn on the TV and watch it.

517
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:41,548
The whole nation is in an uproar.

518
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:44,425
It's your employee.
How could you not know that?

519
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:49,138
This is unfortunate for me too.
I'm a victim here.

520
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:52,767
Kim Pil-yeon, that jerk
showed up out of nowhere

521
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:56,187
and asked me for money
saying he'd disband the labor union.

522
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:00,483
He asserted that he'd expel
about 15 members or so.

523
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,360
Think about it.

524
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:05,655
With about 15 members expelled,
we can't even call it the labor union.

525
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:08,616
I just fell for his petty tricks

526
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,578
and got ripped off.

527
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:14,706
It's not a bad thing to watch someone
who borrowed my money.

528
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:18,918
It just doesn't appeal to me.

529
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:20,503
It doesn't?

530
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:30,263
Please take care, detectives.

531
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:33,600
Mr. Choi.

532
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:36,811
Next time we meet,
I won't let you get away.

533
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:39,856
I'll make sure

534
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:42,150
we will never meet again.

535
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:48,239
Darn it.

536
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:53,912
He's really suspicious, right?

537
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:56,372
Was he home alone
the night Kim Pil-yeon died?

538
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:59,500
I'll check all the footage
in the neighborhood.

539
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:01,502
Make sure to check them all.

540
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,380
Then let's see
if we should meet him again or not.

541
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:10,595
Sir, I sincerely beg for your forgiveness.

542
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:14,349
I'll make sure to fix it.
Please give me another chance.

543
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:21,773
It's not like I can give you a chance.

544
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:24,692
You're supposed to prove yourself.

545
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:27,654
Yes, sir. I'll prove myself for sure.

546
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:31,157
I will make sure
to get your daughter-in-law elected

547
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:34,285
and move everything forward as planned.

548
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:36,162
I'll risk my life for it.

549
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:38,414
Don't risk your life for trifles.

550
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:40,667
Remember

551
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:45,213
that I have a big stake in this game.

552
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:46,839
Yes, sir.

553
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:49,217
Let's just go and eat.

554
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,226
My fellow citizens of Songju.

555
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:01,020
I'm your neighbor, number two,

556
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:02,772
Bae Cheon-sik.

557
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:04,732
NUMBER 1, KIM SEO-HUI

558
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:06,859
Everyone.

559
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:09,070
Now that her approval rating has fallen,

560
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:11,280
doesn't Ms. Kim even join the campaigns?

561
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:12,949
How may I help you?

562
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,786
I need to meet with her.
Where is she now?

563
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:18,913
She's in the back.

564
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:22,083
Is this Mr. Kim Seung-cheol's...

565
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,627
I can do this. I really can.

566
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:29,340
I have to do this.

567
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:32,218
I must do it.

568
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:38,808
Hey, Kim Seo-hui.

569
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:40,643
Who are you?

570
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:44,439
SONGJU RMC

571
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:46,899
How dare you call us a commie!

572
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:49,610
Is that how your father taught you?
You traitor's daughter.

573
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,488
We're the ones who revived Songju.

574
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:54,198
But you just dumped us like trash.

575
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:57,201
Get out of here now, you traitor.

576
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:58,911
Hey.

577
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,122
Get out of Songju, okay?

578
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:05,877
Are you all right?

579
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,253
Over here.

580
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:10,506
Gosh, are you okay?

581
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:21,184
You'd lose your voice for a while.
Try not to talk much.

582
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:23,770
And watch what you eat
until it gets better.

583
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,022
I'll prescribe some medicine.

584
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,234
Get some rest.
I'll go get the prescription filled.

585
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:34,405
-Please excuse me.
-Okay.

586
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:42,789
Thank you.

587
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:46,292
The doctor said you shouldn't talk.
Did you not hear him?

588
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:58,554
Why are you doing this?

589
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:06,229
Do you know the guy named Choi Chi-deuk?

590
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:08,815
He's the CEO of Songju RMC
that Kim Pil-yeon worked for.

591
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:14,237
-Do you know him?
-Well...

592
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,321
Wait.

593
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:27,583
HE HELPS ME WITH THE CAMPAIGN

594
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:29,919
He helps you with the campaign?

595
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:36,801
HE SAYS HE KNOWS MY HUSBAND TOO

596
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:38,719
How does he know him?

597
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:42,515
-I heard they met for business.
-For the new business?

598
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:46,853
Why?

599
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:49,272
Nothing. I'll tell you later.

600
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:52,775
Be careful with him just in case.

601
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:55,987
And make sure to tell me
if anything happens.

602
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:58,322
I'll see you later.

603
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:05,997
Kim Pil-yeon and Choi Chi-deuk?

604
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,546
Why does everything seem
to be circling around her?

605
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:23,931
SECURITY CAMERAS OF JEONGSEON

606
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:32,440
-Detective Kang.
-Leave her be.

607
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:35,651
Detective Jo.

608
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:40,031
-About Choi Chi-deuk.
-Yes?

609
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:42,575
It turns out he's the chairman
of Songju Rotary.

610
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:47,538
He's the chairman of Songju Rotary Club.

611
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,957
He's in close association
with local worthies.

612
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:52,960
And he's got some power
with local newspapers.

613
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:55,421
I just found out something
while looking into him.

614
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:57,632
Apparently, he's quite rich.

615
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:00,384
You know the sites
for the new business, right?

616
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:01,677
Yes.

617
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:03,679
Most of the sites belong to Choi Chi-deuk.

618
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:07,600
He spent almost
20 billion won on the sites.

619
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:10,102
-He spent 20 billion won?
-Yes.

620
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:12,813
But what's funny about him is that

621
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:16,317
he doesn't even have
two million won in his account.

622
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,194
Isn't that strange?

623
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:20,863
Are you sure you read the numbers right?

624
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,658
Of course. It says right here.

625
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,495
Hello? This is Investigation Headquarters.

626
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:31,123
Yes, this is Investigation Headquarters
of Songju.

627
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:33,042
Who?

628
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:35,586
Yes, he's here.

629
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:38,589
Please hang on.

630
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:41,884
-What?
-It's from a prosecutor.

631
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,138
Yes?

632
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:50,393
Why did you check
Choi Chi-deuk's bank account?

633
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:53,688
Did you call me here to ask me that?
You could've asked on the phone.

634
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:56,065
Just answer my question.

635
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:02,655
If you tell me first.

636
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:04,699
HAN JUN-SEOK

637
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:07,076
Us prosecutors got to Choi Chi-deuk first.

638
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:08,953
For what?

639
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:12,415
You're even monitoring his bank account.
It must be something.

640
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:13,749
What a nuisance.

641
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:16,919
Are you expecting me
to brief you on every single detail?

642
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:18,796
To us,

643
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:21,549
he's a suspect in a murder case.

644
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:24,385
-A murder case?
-I don't know what this is about,

645
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,304
but I guess this is more urgent.

646
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:30,182
We got a tip-off last month.

647
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,394
The CEO of Songju RMC
is buying all sites

648
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:35,479
for the new business
with inside information.

649
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,064
Once I sign this contract,

650
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,900
will I live like a rich man
in a fancy apartment?

651
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:41,610
Of course you will.

652
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:43,070
You can live well-off

653
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:44,947
without your children's support.

654
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:47,992
You will get a bed of roses in later life.

655
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:51,203
He preyed on naive old men
who had no idea about the new business.

656
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:55,458
If it's true, it's against
the fair-trade act. Anyway, the problem is

657
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:58,419
that he can never afford to buy the sites.

658
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:00,588
According to the informant,

659
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:03,174
there must be someone
keeping him in money.

660
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:05,843
So there's a financier,
and he is just a puppet?

661
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:08,721
-It's possible.
-Who's the informant?

662
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:12,808
That's actually quite tricky.

663
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:20,483
Everyone, Songju used to be
a small and poor city.

664
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:22,068
Who do you think is

665
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:24,987
the father of Songju
who worked night and day

666
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:27,281
to make the city rich and powerful

667
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:29,116
like how it is now?

668
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:32,870
-Kim Seung-cheol!
-Kim Seung-cheol!

669
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:37,625
And right here, we have someone
to carry on his unfinished work.

670
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:39,460
Please support her.

671
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:44,173
She's Candidate Kim Seo-hui,
Assemblyman Kim Seung-cheol's daughter.

672
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:47,385
-Kim Seo-hui!
-Kim Seo-hui!

673
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:50,805
-Kim Seo-hui!
-Kim Seo-hui!

674
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:53,224
Hello.

675
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:57,978
Hello.

676
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:01,816
I'm Assemblyman Kim's daughter,
Kim Seo-hui.

677
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:06,195
I appreciate your support.

678
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:09,198
-Get lost, Kim Seo-hui!
-Get lost!

679
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:12,201
The traitor's daughter
should give up the election!

680
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:13,744
You have to apologize.

681
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:16,038
You're a traitor's daughter.

682
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:18,791
Get lost, you betrayer!

683
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:20,042
Get lost!

684
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:23,879
-Are you all right?
-I'm fine.

685
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:25,673
Get lost!

686
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:28,259
-Get out of Songju.
-Get lost!

687
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:30,386
Dae-yong,

688
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:32,471
I think I know what was happening

689
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:35,933
-to Jeong and Kim.
-What do you know?

690
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,352
I'll tell you when I get there.

691
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,646
Just make sure
to keep Choi Chi-deuk with you.

692
00:40:40,729 --> 00:40:41,564
What did you say?

693
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:46,861
What is going on?

694
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:53,909
-Get lost!
-You traitor, Kim Seo-hui.

695
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:56,495
-Get out of Songju.
-Get out of Songju.

696
00:40:58,164 --> 00:40:59,248
NUMBER 1 KIM SEO-HUI

697
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:02,918
-Get out of Songju.
-Get out of Songju.

698
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:06,422
-Get out of Songju.
-Get out of Songju.

699
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:08,674
What do we do with Seo-hui?
What do we do now?

700
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,342
Why do you even ask?

701
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:12,595
Will you let her give a speech
reeking of eggs?

702
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:13,846
-Go and get her.
-Me?

703
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:15,473
Just go and bring her!

704
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:22,771
DAUGHTER OF SONGJU, KIM SEO-HUI

705
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:24,356
NUMBER 1, KIM SEO-HUI

706
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:28,360
CANDIDATE KIM SEO-HUI
OF LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY

707
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:31,238
My fellow...

708
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:37,328
citizens of Songju...

709
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:41,540
KIM SEO-HUI, LEAVE!

710
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:56,847
Hey, learn how to drive!

711
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:59,391
-Okay. Just go.
-You'd better drive properly.

712
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:12,238
NUMBER 1, KIM SEO-HUI

713
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:14,198
A while ago,

714
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,493
I looked at an album.

715
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:23,916
I noticed that my dad and I didn't
take a lot of photos together.

716
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:27,711
He was always in Songju.

717
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:31,757
Actually, he couldn't
even attend my high school

718
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,218
and college graduation.

719
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,471
When I was young...

720
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:38,681
No.

721
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:41,517
Even up until a few days ago,

722
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:45,104
I felt as if I have lost my dad to Songju.

723
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:48,983
So I was very scared

724
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:53,779
to come face to face with Songju
where my dad was no longer in.

725
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:55,364
Hey, cut it. Cut that out.

726
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:57,950
Hold on, sir. That's a nice speech.

727
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:01,495
But when I went around the city
for my campaign,

728
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:04,707
I saw traces of my dad here and there.

729
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:10,629
It's on the house.

730
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:12,673
Eat up.

731
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:16,427
What will you do
if my stomach ruptures?

732
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:19,096
I'll take full responsibility.
That's not that hard.

733
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:23,684
My gosh, thank you for the food.

734
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:25,894
I know you have a tough job.
Eat a lot.

735
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:28,355
At the kalguksu restaurant in the market,

736
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:32,860
-Sir.
-my dad always had two bowls of noodles.

737
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:36,071
So the owner gave me two bowls of noodles.

738
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:42,536
I saw a memory of my dad in the owner.

739
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:45,748
And at a community center for elderlies...

740
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:49,209
Everyone, this is my third go. Get ready.

741
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:53,088
-All right. It worked. It's my third go.
-Damn it.

742
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:55,883
-Wait. No, I won't play this.
-Jeez.

743
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:58,385
-This makes no sense.
-I worked so hard for this.

744
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:01,555
-If that's true, don't hand me that card!
-There he goes again.

745
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:05,267
"Goodness, that man was so chatty.

746
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:07,978
But he sucked at playing cards."

747
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,524
So later, they shared their winnings
with him because they felt bad.

748
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:18,447
I also saw a memory of my dad
in the elderly, too.

749
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:31,502
I know that I will never surpass my dad.

750
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:33,087
But

751
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:37,800
I want to stay in Songju,

752
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:42,221
the city my dad loved his whole life
and next to my dad.

753
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:45,557
You can scold me
if I do a bad job.

754
00:44:46,725 --> 00:44:48,435
You can yell at me.

755
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:52,064
You can throw eggs at me and spit at me.

756
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:55,526
If you teach me and lead me,

757
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:58,570
I promise you to do my very best.

758
00:44:59,905 --> 00:45:01,657
I will do my best

759
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:05,452
to bring Songju closer
to the city my dad, Kim Seung-cheol,

760
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:09,123
had worked so hard to achieve.

761
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:13,001
And if I keep going at this, one day,

762
00:45:14,002 --> 00:45:16,213
I might be able to see my dad in my dream.

763
00:45:20,634 --> 00:45:23,262
And I hope this is what he tells me then.

764
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:24,763
"Gosh,

765
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:27,433
my youngest daughter.

766
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:35,149
You're working so hard
to follow in my footsteps."

767
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:37,693
-Withdraw your candidacy!
-Withdraw your candidacy!

768
00:45:37,776 --> 00:45:40,487
-Withdraw your candidacy!
-Withdraw your candidacy!

769
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:43,490
-Withdraw your candidacy!
-You're a piece of shit!

770
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:46,744
-Let go of me, you asshole.
-Withdraw your candidacy!

771
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:47,995
Please give me a chance.

772
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:52,624
Not to mar the good name of my father,

773
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,878
I will give everything I have
for this position.

774
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:59,923
Please give me a chance.
I need your help.

775
00:46:01,633 --> 00:46:03,635
-Yes. Let's give her a chance.
-Kim Seo-hui!

776
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:06,555
-Kim Seo-hui!
-Kim Seo-hui!

777
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:10,476
-Kim Seo-hui!
-Kim Seo-hui!

778
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:15,147
-Kim Seo-hui!
-Kim Seo-hui!

779
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:23,155
We meet again.

780
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:27,117
You said you'll live
your life carefully.

781
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:34,082
Pull up your chair.

782
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:40,506
-Detective.
-Oh, my.

783
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:42,758
-You're quite the big landowner.
-Pardon?

784
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:45,344
-Did you inherit all of your land?
-Inherit, my ass.

785
00:46:45,427 --> 00:46:46,970
This jerk bought all of them.

786
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:49,598
How did you know
the business was going to set up there?

787
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:51,433
You stole inside information?

788
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:53,519
If the new business
was a green light,

789
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:56,355
the lots you bought dirt cheap
will become expensive.

790
00:46:56,438 --> 00:46:58,148
You must've finished the calculation.

791
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:01,777
And you were just waiting
for the price to skyrocket.

792
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:03,862
But Kim Seung-cheol and Jeong Sang-hun

793
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:06,907
stabbed you in the back.

794
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:08,867
If they set it up somewhere else,

795
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:11,203
you would be livid, of course.

796
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:14,331
Five-billion-won land would easily
increase twentyfold.

797
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:16,834
Your dream was about to be shattered
because of Jeong.

798
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:18,502
-Right?
-Detective.

799
00:47:19,127 --> 00:47:22,798
-This is a misunderstanding.
-By the way, Jeong told a prosecutor

800
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:27,010
that Choi Chi-deuk didn't have
any means to buy this land.

801
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:29,388
Since the source of the money
was suspicious,

802
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:31,515
he told the prosecutor
to look into it.

803
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:34,101
I knew it.

804
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:37,855
You can't run this kind of operation
on your own.

805
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:41,275
Something was off about Kim Pil-yeon, too.
Fighting for the company?

806
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:46,071
He got so wrapped up in gambling.
He wasn't interested in the factory.

807
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:50,826
It makes me wonder
why both you and Jeong Sang-hun

808
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:55,163
were so eager to give Kim Pil-yeon money.

809
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:58,750
It means he knew something.

810
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:02,129
For example,

811
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:06,717
he might have known
who was backing you up, Mr. Choi.

812
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:15,767
You know what? Let's clear up
this misunderstanding and talk about this.

813
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:18,604
Just tell me who's backing you up.

814
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,772
Then, we'll just let you go as a free man.

815
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:23,442
How about that?

816
00:48:44,963 --> 00:48:47,049
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
I wasn't going to laugh.

817
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:48,800
Did he seriously just laugh?

818
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:51,136
Can't we do something?

819
00:48:51,219 --> 00:48:53,764
-On my way here,
-Don't get riled up. Just watch.

820
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:55,474
I decided not to say a thing.

821
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:58,810
But it's so hard not to tell you
since this is hilarious.

822
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,688
Detectives.

823
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:03,482
Detectives!

824
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:08,153
You shouldn't lead your investigation
based on your imagination. Okay?

825
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:13,367
Hey.

826
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:16,536
Hey. Is this funny to you?

827
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:22,084
-Why did you kill Kim Pil-yeon?
-Why do you keep saying that I killed him?

828
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:27,089
I can't even kill an ant.
I'm too weak-hearted to kill anything.

829
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:31,843
You made me come all the way here to talk
about this nonsense.

830
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:33,345
Do you have proof?

831
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:34,930
Do you?

832
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:39,309
Seriously.
Korean police officers are so... Damn it.

833
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:55,242
What's that?

834
00:49:58,286 --> 00:49:59,454
All right.

835
00:50:00,205 --> 00:50:01,206
Where did he get that?

836
00:50:04,459 --> 00:50:05,669
We won.

837
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:08,964
Gosh, you look much better in the video.

838
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:19,141
The building where Kim Pil-yeon
was hiding in was set on fire that night.

839
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:23,562
As it so happens, on the same day
around the same time,

840
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:27,232
you bought oil from a gas station nearby.

841
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:28,942
That's odd, you know.

842
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:33,947
I doubt that you went to Jeongseon
from Songju just to buy oil.

843
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:37,325
You set it on fire.

844
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:39,995
To kill Kim Pil-yeon.

845
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:47,502
You failed to kill him that night,
so you followed him all the way to Ansan.

846
00:50:51,089 --> 00:50:52,049
Didn't I tell you?

847
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:54,843
I said I won't let you get away
next time we meet.

848
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:58,388
Mr. Choi, what do you think
about our imagination now?

849
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:04,686
That's enough.

850
00:51:05,353 --> 00:51:06,313
Who's that?

851
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:08,565
-Who's that?
-Wait.

852
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:11,109
JANG AND JANG LAW FIRM

853
00:51:13,528 --> 00:51:16,615
He was with his mistress
when the incident took place and the 19th,

854
00:51:16,698 --> 00:51:19,785
-the day of Kim Pil-yeon's death.
-Hey, this is bad.

855
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:22,204
Here's her statement.

856
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:26,666
You'd rather go
with adultery than murder?

857
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:30,212
Why didn't you tell us that sooner?

858
00:51:30,295 --> 00:51:32,464
He's in a divorce lawsuit with his wife.

859
00:51:32,714 --> 00:51:35,175
If she finds out,
he'll be at a disadvantage.

860
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:39,596
The land is under his name,
so there's nothing illegal about that.

861
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:40,972
The fire.

862
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:43,892
And he went to Jeongseon on the third

863
00:51:43,975 --> 00:51:47,104
to travel with his friend.
And his car ran out of gas.

864
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:51,608
I'm sure the lady will testify
if it's necessary.

865
00:51:51,691 --> 00:51:54,569
-That friend of his is quite useful.
-Darn it.

866
00:51:55,237 --> 00:51:56,488
Where did she come from?

867
00:51:58,448 --> 00:52:00,992
You can't implicate
that he was involved in the murder

868
00:52:01,076 --> 00:52:04,621
of Kim Pil-yeon because he bought gas
at a gas station nearby.

869
00:52:04,704 --> 00:52:06,998
Besides, he didn't die that day, either.

870
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:09,543
Do you have other evidence?

871
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:13,380
So you don't have anything
to hold my client here.

872
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:16,925
How were you able to prepare this much
during that short period of time?

873
00:52:17,425 --> 00:52:20,554
It's as if you had everything prepared,
knowing this would happen.

874
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:25,892
If you have any further questions,
you can contact me.

875
00:52:26,768 --> 00:52:28,979
-We should go.
-Okay.

876
00:52:33,608 --> 00:52:34,526
Damn it.

877
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:38,989
One more thing.

878
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:42,742
I'm dying to know.

879
00:52:43,451 --> 00:52:45,579
You hardly have any money
in your bank account.

880
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:47,914
Where did you get all that money
to buy the land

881
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:50,584
and have the luxury to hire
an expensive lawyer like him?

882
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:01,928
-Hey.
-"Hey"? Are you talking to me?

883
00:53:04,097 --> 00:53:05,015
Wait for me.

884
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:08,018
I'll catch you no matter what.

885
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:11,396
Okay. Have a good day.

886
00:53:13,481 --> 00:53:14,316
Long time no see.

887
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:17,444
-What? You piece of--
-You're scaring me.

888
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:19,821
Damn it!

889
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:36,796
I heard the police are investigating
Mr. Choi at the moment.

890
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:42,469
They believe that he is connected
to Kim Pil-yeon's murder.

891
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:46,640
The thing you asked me the other day.

892
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:50,352
Mr. In was in a meeting
with his team in the morning

893
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:52,270
of the day when Sang-hun disappeared.

894
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:54,522
In the afternoon,
he met with a subcontractor,

895
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:56,191
so he wasn't in his office.

896
00:53:57,484 --> 00:53:58,318
Is that all?

897
00:53:58,985 --> 00:54:01,655
I checked with the subcontractor.
They had a meeting,

898
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:03,740
but it was replaced with e-mails

899
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:05,659
as Mr. In's request.

900
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:10,747
I cannot confirm his whereabouts
for two hours that day.

901
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:17,420
Sir, why are you keeping him around
if you don't trust him?

902
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:19,714
Is there a reason?

903
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:23,885
You're suspecting him.

904
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:25,512
Yeong-min.

905
00:54:28,014 --> 00:54:30,809
Keep your friends close,

906
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:34,312
but keep your enemies closer.

907
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:38,358
Keep an eye on him.

908
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:57,919
Nothing happened. Nothing at all.

909
00:54:58,003 --> 00:55:00,130
If something happened,
do you think I'd be here?

910
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:02,966
Gosh, it's all because of that bastard,
Kim Pil-yeon.

911
00:55:03,216 --> 00:55:04,718
But I'm relieved, you know.

912
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:07,345
Kim Pil-yeon and Jeong Sang-hun are dead.

913
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:10,473
Seeing how everything is going smoothly,
God must be on our--

914
00:55:19,065 --> 00:55:20,358
Watch your tongue.

915
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:24,321
Don't you want to sell the factory?

916
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:27,407
I'm sorry.

917
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:34,581
But,

918
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:37,792
let's get one thing straight.

919
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:40,253
It's not that I want to sell it,

920
00:55:42,213 --> 00:55:44,007
it's more like you want to buy it.

921
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:46,092
I don't have to sell the factory,

922
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:49,179
but if things go wrong,

923
00:55:49,971 --> 00:55:51,681
won't you be in big trouble?

924
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:56,978
I think I have the upper hand
in this round.

925
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:04,694
See you when we sign the contract.
Mr. In.

926
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:22,587
Let me present our candidate.

927
00:56:23,421 --> 00:56:25,090
She's a proud daughter of Songju.

928
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:27,300
Candidate Kim Seo-hui!

929
00:56:28,259 --> 00:56:29,469
Hello!

930
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:34,891
I'm Candidate Number One Kim Seo-hui,
the daughter of Songju.

with the utmost attention.

932
00:56:39,312 --> 00:56:43,191
I will be the first one to make an effort
for the better of Songju.

933
00:56:43,274 --> 00:56:45,026
I will always try my best.

934
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:46,486
Please vote for me.

00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:48,488
I'm Candidate Number One Kim Seo-hui.

942
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:09,300
I will do my best!

943
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:11,302
I'd like to ask for your support!

944
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:13,513
-Thank you. Please support me.
-Thank you.

Mr. Lee will represent him.

948
00:57:31,197 --> 00:57:33,992
I will make no mistakes this time.

Who's the bastard that's behind all this?

957
00:58:42,894 --> 00:58:43,895
Captain.

958
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:45,605
Captain.

959
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:49,359
Choi Chi-deuk is leaving
to the Philippines tonight.

960
00:58:49,984 --> 00:58:51,444
-What?
-What?

961
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:53,905
-He's leaving the country tonight.
-He's on the run.

962
00:58:53,988 --> 00:58:55,740
If he leaves, we'll never get him.

963
00:58:55,823 --> 00:58:58,660
You two, stop Choi Chi-deuk
from leaving the country.

964
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:01,079
-How?
-Be creative.

965
00:59:01,162 --> 00:59:04,290
Until Tae-sik arrives at the airport,
hold him for any reason.

966
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:06,376
-Okay.
-Okay. What time is his flight?

967
00:59:06,459 --> 00:59:08,503
-I'm on it.
-Text me the flight information.

973
00:59:32,694 --> 00:59:35,613
As you can see,
the candidates are nervously waiting

974
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:38,157
for the result of the exit poll
at their base camps.

975
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:47,584

Detective, please stop this. Please.

996
01:02:15,648 --> 01:02:18,359
Someone came to the building
before the foot appeared.

997
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:19,986
Guess who put the foot there?

998
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:22,989
We'll pass the bill for the new business
in two months.

999
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:24,574
The lot for the new business.

1000
01:02:24,699 --> 01:02:28,035
That's the only common ground
of all the victims we found so far.

1001
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:30,288
Dad, you were against this bill?

1002
01:02:30,371 --> 01:02:34,333
I know exactly where Jeong Sang-hun is.
