THIS DRAMA IS A WORK OF FICTION.
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,

00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:45,086
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGIONS, AND INCIDENTS
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:50,008
TERMINATION IS MURDER

4

GUARANTEE OUR RIGHT TO LIVE

5
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:55,847
WE WANT OUR WORKPLACE BACK

6
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,860
I will start the countdown now.

00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:13,114

10
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:25,001
Kim Seo-hui of Liberal Democratic Party.
She has received 51 percent of the vote.

11
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,087
It's been confirmed that she's elected.

12
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,923
-Kim Seo-hui.
-Kim Seo-hui.

13
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:33,802
-I'd like to thank the residents of Songju
-Kim Seo-hui.

14
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:37,889
-for casting their valuable votes for me.
-Kim Seo-hui.

15
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:44,646
-Kim Seo-hui.

-Hong Min-guk.
-Hong Min-guk.

17
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:50,151
-Hong Min-guk.
-Please stop it.

18
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,195
NEW MESSAGE

19
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:54,531
CONGRATULATIONS.
THIS IS MY PRESENT FOR YOU.

20
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:21,141
-What is it?
-Where are you now?

21
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:24,018
-What is it? I'm almost at the airport.
-Turn around.

22
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:26,563
What are you talking about?
I can't turn around here.

23
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:29,607
What?

24
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:36,573
Sir.

25
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:39,117
You didn't see anyone suspicious?

26
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,744
I didn't leave my seat
except for going to the restroom.

27
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,872
-I can't believe this.
-Okay, then.

28
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:46,207
I'd like to see
the list of visitor log for today.

29
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,001
There's no such thing here.

30
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:50,086
Only a few people came
because of the strike.

31
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,338
Then I'll take a look
at the security footages.

32
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:53,715
Suit yourself.

33
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:56,759
PROTECT THE RIGHT
TO AN ADEQUATE STANDARD OF LIVING

34
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:00,221
That's Detective Jo's car.

35
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:15,236
Dae-yong.

36
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:16,863
Tae-sik.

37
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:20,783
Damn it.

38
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:24,078
He found it.

39
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,417
Mr. Choi.
Did you see him?

40
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:33,171
He's not himself.
He can't answer any of our questions.

41
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:34,547
-Hey.
-Yes?

42
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,634
Get a grip, and answer my question!

43
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:40,386
-Did you see who dropped that off here?
-Hey.

44
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,513
-You must've seen something!
-Hey.

45
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:43,890
-Tae-sik.
-Damn it.

46
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,394
What's wrong with him?

47
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,104
-Hey.
-Choi Chi-deuk.

48
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:52,523
-Choi Chi-deuk! What's wrong with him?
-Damn it.

49
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:53,650
Choi Chi-deuk. Hey.

50
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,110
Tae-sik. Come on, somebody, help me.

51
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:03,409
DETECTIVE JO TAE-SIK

52
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,412
Ms. Kim.

53
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,791
I need you to come
to the autopsy room now.

54
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,334
What?

55
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:13,795
Why?

56
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:16,297
We found

57
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:18,174
Mr. Jeong's foot.

58
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:24,097
THE CITY FOR EVERYONE, SONGJU

59
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,646
-Seo-hui.
-Yeong-min, Sang-hun...

60
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:35,066
Seo-hui!

61
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:38,528
KIM SEO-HUI OF LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY
GETS ELECTED

62
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,072
What an impeccable timing.

63
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:54,836
Where is it?

64
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,589
-Where is it?
-It's not here.

65
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,883
We moved it after the autopsy.

66
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,390
Why is this happening?

67
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,187
Why...

68
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,106
Why does it keep happening?

69
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,528
Did Sang-hun do something wrong?

70
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,783
Did he? Who did this?

71
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,206
Why...

72
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,251
Why does this keep happening?

73
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:42,633
I did everything I was asked to do.

74
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:50,641
I did everything I was asked to do.
What else must I do?

75
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:58,358
What am I supposed to do?

76
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,152
What do I do now?

77
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,491
What do I do?

78
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,964
What am I supposed to do now?

79
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,805
-Why on earth...
-I did everything.

80
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:32,100
is this happening?

81
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:37,105
-Detective,
-What else do you want me to do?

82
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:39,649
-please stop this. Please.
-What else do you want?

83
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:42,360
What am I supposed to do?

84
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:43,820
Please. I'm begging you.

85
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:03,464
Damn it. Do you want some?

86
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:04,382
No.

87
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:08,511
I did find the footage.
Do you want to take a look?

88
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:12,515
Captain.

89
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:14,350
Captain!

90
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,061
Yes? I'm here. Did you find anything?

91
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,104
Yes.

92
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:20,773
-Gosh.
-This is all I have for now.

93
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:26,070
Choi Chi-deuk installed only one
security camera at that big factory.

94
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,114
Only in the hallway near his office.

95
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:29,949
Something definitely feels off.

96
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:33,244
He was the only one at the factory
at that hour.

97
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,998
Jeez, our suspect is our only eyewitness?

98
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,877
Is it possible he staged it himself?

99
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:42,712
The foot was severed a day ago.

100
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:45,047
How could he if he was in his office
at the time?

101
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:48,342
Hey, he could have gotten
someone else to do the job,

102
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,594
so we don't suspect him.

103
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:51,095
Why would he want that?

104
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:56,684
He already booked a ticket
to the Philippines to leave Korea.

105
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,312
Who the heck put the foot there?

106
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,107
Someone came
before the foot appeared.

107
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:04,484
Who's that?

108
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:10,448
What's happening? That's an hour
and a half before the foot. Who's that?

109
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:17,413
This guy...

110
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,999
-Where did I see him?
-Where did I see him?

111
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:22,502
Remember the guy

112
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:26,506
who's always with Jeong Yeong-mun?
And he's in Strategic Planning Department.

113
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,674
Gosh, his name was In...

114
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,343
-In Dong-gu.
-Yes.

115
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,054
Why was he at the factory?

116
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:46,317
NO CALLER ID: CONGRATULATIONS
THIS IS MY PRESENT FOR YOU

117
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:53,616
The number you have dialed
does not exist. Please check again--

118
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:04,418
Where is Sang-hun?

119
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,172
MESSAGE DELIVERY FAILED

120
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,511
Is this the present you told me about?

121
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,847
MESSAGE DELIVERY FAILED

122
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,224
I did everything you wanted.

123
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,184
Send Sang-hun back.

124
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,187
What is it that you want from me?

125
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:24,772
MESSAGE DELIVERY FAILED

126
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:38,953
I will do everything you tell me to do.

127
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:43,416
Please send back Sang-hun.
I'm begging you. Please send him back.

128
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,127
Please spare him.

129
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,854
NOW YOU MUST PROPOSE THE BILL
FOR THE NEW BUSINESS

130
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,155
Why won't you answer my questions?

131
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:15,489
Why won't you?

132
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,584
"New business."

133
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,628
New business...

134
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,172
New business...

135
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:33,090
New business...

136
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:43,142
Why did you go to Songju RMC last night?

137
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,186
I needed to wrap up a contract.

138
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:46,646
What contract?

139
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,192
The sale of the factory.

140
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:53,402
I see.

141
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,574
TOMORROW'S ECONOMY

142
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,663
I guess you and Mr. Choi are pretty close

143
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:07,625
seeing he called you
right after finding the foot.

144
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:11,754
But he called the police
only 30 minutes after finding the foot.

145
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:15,966
Did you two have that much
to talk about the severed foot?

146
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,680
No, it was the contrary.
I couldn't talk to him at all.

147
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:24,433
Mr. Choi was panicking,
so I calmed him down.

148
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,061
And it was me who told him
to call the police.

149
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:32,191
Are you aware of what Mr. Choi did?

150
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,985
He bought the land where Songju RMC is

151
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,779
as well as all the land
around there.

152
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,614
He probably wanted to make some money

153
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:40,908
when JQ set up the new business there.

154
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:46,163
-And?
-You don't seem surprised.

155
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,040
You already knew.

156
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,167
Then, do you know this, too?

157
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,712
Mr. Jeong reported this
to the prosecution.

158
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:58,759
Well, Mr. Jeong has never handled
a project like this one before.

159
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,971
When you do business, you're bound to find

160
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:04,765
people like him
who's good at making money.

161
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:07,518
If we take legal action every time,
it'll be a hassle.

162
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:08,853
Hold on a second.

163
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:12,356
Was that you

164
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:14,024
who got him a lawyer?

165
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:15,776
Yes.

166
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:19,363
-Why?
-I needed to close the deal quickly

167
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:20,906
to proceed with our business.

168
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:24,201
To be precise,
I wasn't protecting Mr. Choi,

169
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:27,329
I was protecting the land Mr. Choi owned.

170
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,915
Mr. Jeong's hand and foot
might have been severed

171
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,334
because Mr. Choi wanted
to make money off the land.

172
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,086
But you're protecting what?

173
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:37,631
Can all the rich people separate
business and personal life this easily?

174
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:49,727
I have answered
all of the questions I can for you.

175
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:02,031
No, I have one more question.

176
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:07,077
What do you think?

177
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,371
Who do you think

178
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:11,457
put the foot there?

179
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,139
RECORDING

180
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:39,527
TOMORROW'S ECONOMY

181
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,536
Look at the blueprint first.
Right here.

182
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:52,081
That's just the blueprint.
But in fact, we'll build from there

183
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:57,044
to all the way over there.
All the way to the end there.

184
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:00,923
Well, once the bill passes,

185
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,759
it will go up by five times
given the current rise.

186
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:07,930
Then, the profits will amount
to at least 200 billion won from the land.

187
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:20,442
HUGE DISCOUNTS, GIFT WITH PURCHASE

188
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,655
It's impossible to trace it.

189
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,283
There's no information
about the owner.

190
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:30,786
It was probably sent by a canceled number.
That way, we can't trace it.

191
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,415
Why don't you ask the police for help?
I doubt that they can trace it though.

192
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:38,627
What do you want me to do?

193
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,921
What do you want?

194
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,756
I did everything you asked for.

195
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,050
I did everything!

196
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:47,094
What have I done wrong?

197
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,513
Send him back to me!

198
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:59,273
REPRESENTATIVE HONG MIN-GUK

199
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:19,585
Well, it makes me wonder
if she'll be on the same page with us.

200
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:23,505
You got an owner of a coffee shop elected.

201
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,383
I mean, look what happened to her husband.

202
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,761
Do you think she'll be
in her right mind to work?

203
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:31,388
-I'm here to see Mr. Hong.
-Please follow me.

204
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,140
That means it'll be easy to use her.

205
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:36,268
When she's not in her right mind,
we should push forward.

206
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,687
No, no. Let's go easy on her today.

207
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,982
Let's not scare her away.

208
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,235
-You don't need to worry.
-What do you mean?

209
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:47,905
Hello, Assemblywoman Kim. Come in.

210
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:50,032
Come in.

211
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,078
-I'm sorry I'm late.
-Come and sit down.

212
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:58,707
The assemblymen here helped
your father a lot when he was with us.

213
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:03,420
And now, they have gathered here
to help you this time.

214
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,881
Of course, we ought to help.

215
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:08,884
As you all know,
Late Kim Seung-cheol worked so hard

216
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,886
on the bill for the new business.

217
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:13,430
And it was also
an important business for our party.

218
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,642
It was utterly heartbroken to see

219
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:19,103
he couldn't fulfill
his long-cherished goal.

220
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:21,313
But his daughter is going
to carry on his plan.

221
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:24,066
Of course, I ought to help her
with every means I have.

222
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:25,901
So the new business--

223
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,903
When is the public hearing for it?

224
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,822
-I heard it's tomorrow.
-I see.

225
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:33,367
-Did you get enough people?
-Come on, I did that long ago.

226
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:37,788
Ms. Kim, all you need to do tomorrow
is just be there for the party. Okay?

227
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:39,331
Yes.

228
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:44,169
Goodness, Mr. Hong. Don't you think
you're favoring her too much?

229
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:48,507
No other assemblymen or women
could have it as easy as Ms. Kim here.

230
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,093
Mr. Yang, if you were
as pretty as Ms. Kim,

231
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,220
I'd favor you even if you didn't want it.

232
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:58,183
My goodness, I can be
pretty good-looking, you know.

233
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,603
I'll inject the sedatives now.

234
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:07,109
I injected the sedatives just now,
but he's still in shock.

235
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:09,236
-He's not ready to make a statement.
-Okay.

236
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,863
We'll only ask a few questions.

237
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:14,533
-Don't provoke the patient no matter what.
-We won't.

238
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,627
Hey, Choi Chi-deuk.
You can hear me, right?

239
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,588
Listen carefully.

240
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,425
Who left Jeong's foot
at the factory last night?

241
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:32,509
It was you, wasn't it?

242
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,139
His foot...

243
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:42,686
He's showing some incredible acting
since yesterday.

244
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,688
What are you mumbling about?

245
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:45,981
Land...

246
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:49,485
Land?

247
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:51,945
Is it because of that land?

248
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:55,074
This all happened
because of the land you have, right?

249
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,619
What the heck is with that land?

250
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:01,914
Why is everyone connected
to the land dying? Why?

251
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:04,416
Hold on.

252
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,251
Hey, it looks like he knows something.

253
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,629
-You'd better talk now.
-Come on.

254
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:10,214
Stop trying to hurt him.

255
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:13,050
It's all right, Mr. Choi. You're okay.

256
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:15,761
Tell you what.
Let's have an honest conversation.

257
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:19,723
Are you a victim or an assailant
in this mess with the land?

258
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,726
Please save me.

259
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,896
-Pardon?
-Please protect me.

260
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:27,731
I'll tell you everything.

261
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,608
Hey, tell us what? What is it?

262
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:32,569
Protect me. Please keep me safe.

263
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,488
-Okay. We got it.
-Okay.

264
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:35,781
-Calm down.
-Please.

265
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:38,367
-Okay. Calm down.
-I'll tell you everything.

266
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,703
We'll protect you and keep you safe.
Just trust us.

267
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,456
It's all right. Just tell us.
What is this about?

268
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,416
I know.

269
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:52,047
Jeong...

270
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:53,966
-Jeong Sang-hun?
-I know

271
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:57,803
exactly where

272
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:00,806
-Jeong Sang-hun is.
-You do?

273
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,191
Tae-sik, did you find him?

274
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:57,446
-What about you, Jong-cheol?
-Not here.

275
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,199
Not here, either.

276
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,547
Come and dig here.

277
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:20,302
Hey! Come and dig here!

278
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,012
Did you find something?

279
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:41,823
Isn't that a bone?

280
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:45,953
Hey, be careful not to damage it.

281
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,040
Are you sure this is a human bone?

282
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,209
It's too small.

283
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,591
-I think this is a dog's bone.
-Damn it.

284
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,469
Don't just stand there and watch.
Dig somewhere else.

285
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:03,679
-Okay.
-Okay.

286
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:07,557
Dae-yong.

287
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:10,811
-Choi Chi-deuk.
-What?

288
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:14,523
This bastard. We must check
if he's still at the hospital.

289
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:20,779
Damn it.

290
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:22,864
Are you okay, Detective Jang?

291
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:24,408
I'm sorry.

292
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:26,994
-Didn't you major in Judo in college?
-What happened?

293
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:29,538
All of a sudden--

294
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:32,582
-Were you alone?
-Yes. I'm sorry.

295
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,209
How... Damn it.

296
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:36,295
That rat. Damn it.

297
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:45,387
HOSPITAL

298
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:28,305
So is this how he ended up?

299
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:31,350
Gosh, that crazy bastard.

300
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:33,602
Did he come all the way here?

301
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:42,861
It's just a customary public hearing
before legislation.

302
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:45,238
It's more like a show.

303
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:46,615
You don't have to worry.

304
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,325
What if they ask questions?

305
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,077
I don't know anything.

306
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:53,372
Mr. Hong has found some experts for you.

307
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:54,790
They will take care of it.

308
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:58,960
Please go in.

309
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:05,509
Today we will hear various opinions
from the debaters

310
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:07,135
and put them together

311
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:11,139
to propose the special bill within today.

312
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:12,891
And we will work on it

313
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:16,436
as the party platform
of Liberal Democratic Party.

314
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,480
We will try our best

315
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:22,234
to contribute to the country's development
with the new renewable energy business.

316
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:26,696
I, Hong Min-guk, promise you, on my honor.

317
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:30,575
PUBLIC HEARING FOR NEW RENEWABLE
ENERGY BUSINESS COMPLEX IN SONGJU

318
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:37,124
Finally, we will take one last question.

319
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,167
I have a question.

320
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,293
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY

321
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:41,211
Please go ahead.

322
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:47,634
Assemblywoman Kim Seo-hui,
it sounds like a good bill.

323
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:49,553
So I was wondering
when it'll take place.

324
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,183
-Assemblywoman Kim.
-Yes.

325
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:01,898
I'm Kang Man-su, the chief of staff
of Assemblywoman Kim.

326
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:07,028
If the bill is approved quickly,
we're hoping to push for the establishment

327
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:11,533
of the new renewable energy complex
in three to six months at the latest.

328
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:13,869
Thank you for your answer.

329
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:16,663
As we are pressed for time,
we'd like to finish--

330
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:18,415
Aren't you taking more questions?

331
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:23,170
Now Assemblywoman Kim Seo-hui
will give a closing address.

332
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:26,548
Why do you think the problems
brought up with the recommendations

333
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,175
have not been settled at all?

334
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:30,093
Assemblyman Yoon,
I didn't give you--

335
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:31,970
If the bill is passed,

336
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:35,682
it is estimated
to cost 96 billion won a year.

337
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:38,810
Is it reasonable
a company monopolizes the national budget

338
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:41,396
-of almost 100 billion won?
-Hey, Assemblyman Yoon!

339
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:45,066
I'd like to ask Assemblywoman Kim
who's hosting the hearing.

340
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:48,153
Do you believe it is okay

341
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:49,905
to promulgate the new law?

342
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:52,866
-Assemblyman Yoon, please stop.
-Of course, it's okay.

343
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:54,951
We never propose a bad bill.

344
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:57,996
Assemblywoman Kim, do you
even understand what the bill is about?

345
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,582
I mean, did you even read it?

346
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:04,211
Assemblyman Yoon, you can just enjoy it
when you're in someone else's party.

347
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:06,713
-Why would you pour cold water?
-Who's this party for?

348
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:09,633
-Is it just for Liberal Democratic Party?
-That's enough.

349
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:11,676
-Stop it.
-Answer the question.

350
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:13,094
Everyone, please.

351
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:22,729
Today's public hearing is over.

352
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:24,189
Thank you.

353
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:29,528
It's like a hit list.

354
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:31,738
Everyone under suspicion is dying.

355
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:35,075
He just jumped into the sea
after running away? Can you believe it?

356
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:38,870
It's just ridiculous.
And we didn't even find the dead body yet.

357
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:47,879
Kim Seung-cheol, Jeong Sang-hun,
Kim Pil-yeon, and Choi Chi-deuk.

358
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:49,798
What do they have in common?

359
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:52,259
Those four people?

360
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:57,305
-They all are men.
-My goodness.

361
00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:59,766
I just said it. Don't yell at me.

362
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:02,686
The land. They all knew
about the land worth 20 billion won.

363
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:05,313
If that's why they were killed,
we should be dead by now.

364
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:08,400
I wish you were dead.

365
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,070
Wait.

366
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:15,615
If Choi Chi-deuk is dead,
what will happen to the land?

367
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:17,158
Why do you even ask?

368
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,703
It will go to his wife
who's divorcing him.

369
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:24,082
I feel like I'm lost.

370
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:27,627
It's like a roller coaster.
It keeps going up and down.

371
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:31,631
You know what it's like.
Once it goes down, it'll go up again.

372
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,762
Dae-yong.

373
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,348
You think Jeong will return alive?

374
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,811
I just hope we can find his body.

375
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:49,107
Tae-sik, are you all right?

376
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:52,485
This is just part of your work.

377
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:01,786
ASSEMBLYWOMAN KIM SEO-HUI

378
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:05,957
CONGRATULATIONS, THIS IS MY GIFT FOR YOU

379
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:08,168
WHERE IS SANG HUN?

380
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:10,295
WHAT IS IT THAT YOU WANT FROM ME?

381
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:12,130
PROPOSE A BILL FOR THE NEW BUSINESS

382
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:17,636
The new business.

383
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:19,763
The new business...

384
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:22,140
The new business...

385
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:25,477
Assemblywoman Kim, do you
even understand what the bill is about?

386
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:28,188
I mean, did you even read it?

387
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,607
What about the new business?

388
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:33,818
THE SPECIAL LEGISLATIVE BILL

389
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:40,075
The new renewable energy complex...

390
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:43,745
The energy business...

391
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:49,959
What am I doing now?

392
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:54,839
This isn't what I'm supposed to do now.
What am I doing?

393
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:02,013
What do I do? What should I do, Sang-hun?

394
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:14,150
Tae-sik.

395
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:18,488
Tae-sik.

396
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:21,658
Jo Tae-sik, wait for me.

397
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:23,827
I'm not going with you.

398
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,995
Jo Tae-sik, stop right there.

399
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,414
I won't stop.

400
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:31,167
Play with me.

401
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:33,962
No, I'll play with other boys.

402
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,255
Go away!

403
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:37,215
Stop it.

404
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:39,551
Don't follow me.

405
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,595
You're so mean!

406
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:54,065
Hey, are you really leaving?

407
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:27,599
Hey.

408
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:32,771
Hey.

409
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,023
Hey.

410
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:36,649
Where are you?

411
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,827
Hey, where are you?

412
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:50,455
Hey!

413
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:53,625
Where are you? Stop hiding.

414
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:56,586
Hey.

415
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:17,398
FORENSIC INVESTIGATION

416
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,694

ASSEMBLYWOMAN KIM SEO-HUI

418
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:18,918
DETECTIVE JO TAE-SIK

419
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:20,628
Seo-hui. Ha...

420
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:26,134
SEO-HUI. HA...

421
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:37,228
KIM SEO-HUI

422
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:49,198
Hello?

423
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:53,620
Is something wrong?

424
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:55,747
I'm sorry.

425
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:01,169
That I can't find your husband.

426
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:07,216
Just hang in there.

427
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,888
This isn't what I like to say,

428
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:16,726
but there's nothing else I can say to you.

429
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,774
Hang in there, Seo-hui.

430
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:26,778
Just hold up

431
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:31,407
somehow.

432
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,183
I'm holding up.

433
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:00,103
I can do this.

434
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:02,981
I'll make it through.

435
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,025
I can.

436
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:18,496
RENDEZVOUS RESTAURANT

437
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:24,377
Goodness.

438
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:26,421
My gosh.

439
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:30,466
Detective.

440
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:33,469
Detective Jo.

441
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,139
Detective Jo!

442
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:39,892
I haven't even started my day yet.

443
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:42,520
What are you doing
in front of someone else's store?

444
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:46,107
You can come when you're sober, you know?

445
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,783
My goodness.

446
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:59,704
Jeong Sang-hun should know
what I'm going through now.

447
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:02,331
SONGJU FOOD

448
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:06,544
Oh dear.

449
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:10,256
Don't drink too much.
It's not good for your health.

450
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:13,968
Detective Jo, stay healthy.

451
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:16,888
-Thank you.
-This is Shiquan Dabu tonic. Drink it up.

452
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:26,230
-Gosh, I feel better now.
-All right.

453
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:29,609
Thank you.

454
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:31,652
-I appreciate your hard work.
-It's nothing.

455
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:42,121
SONGJU FOOD

456
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:50,421
Excuse me.

457
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,465
Let me ask you something.

458
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:54,550
How often do you come here a day?

459
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:57,678
-Twice a day. In the morning and evening.
-What time in the evening?

460
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,349
I'm asking you.

461
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:02,892
At eight. Okay?

462
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:07,313
Can I check your dashcam? For March 3rd.

463
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:08,439
I wasn't here that day.

464
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:09,524
Wait.

465
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:12,360
Darn it.

466
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:21,327
SONGJU FOOD

467
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:24,580
It was close, but we still won.

468
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,916
I guess we're off to a good start.

469
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,960
We should carry out the next step.

470
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:30,211
Sure.

471
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:33,005
We'll pass the bill
in two months at the latest.

472
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:36,134
Then there will be news articles,
and it will become an issue.

473
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:39,387
And we'll win the general election.
Then the presidential election...

474
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:42,765
Of course, it's not like

475
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:45,101
I'm rushing things for my sake.

476
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:49,063
If we fail to pass the bill
before the new assembly convenes,

477
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,732
all the efforts JQ has been made
for the past four years

478
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:52,942
will come to nothing.

479
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:55,611
They will start all over from the bid.

480
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,990
In fact, this might be our last chance--

481
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:00,449
We're counting on you.

482
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:02,910
Of course.

483
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:05,913
Kim Seo-hui is now in the palm of my hand.

484
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:08,207
By pressuring her a few times,

485
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:10,918
I can lead her by the nose.

486
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:21,929
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY

487
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,598
The door is closing.

488
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,187
What's the point of holding
a public hearing?

489
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:31,147
Pardon?

490
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,816
Did you borrow some books?
Now you want to learn about it?

491
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:37,153
I'm not sure if they'd help.

492
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:39,238
The crux of the matter isn't in the books.

493
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:43,492
What's the crux of the matter?

494
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:46,454
Excuse me. Wait.

495
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:49,749
I don't know much about this.
Can you please help me with it?

496
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:00,343
-The election.
-What?

497
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:03,930
Do you know Assemblyman Hong
is running for presidency?

498
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:08,684
It's not his turn yet,
but it's been moved up a little.

499
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:12,688
Because Assemblyman Kim Seung-cheol
passed away.

500
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:16,984
When he was alive,

501
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:19,654
the entire Songju
supported the Liberal Democratic Party.

502
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:22,240
So everyone had forgotten

503
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:25,284
that the city was
the opposition party's turf.

504
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:27,578
Then they realized

505
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:30,081
that they need votes from Songju

506
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:31,958
to win the elections.

507
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:35,461
But Assemblyman Kim Seung-cheol
isn't around anymore.

508
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:39,006
Then they decided to establish
a big business complex there

509
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,549
so the land price goes up.

510
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:43,010
They hope to get more votes that way.

511
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:50,393
That's why they are trying
to push the new business forward.

512
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:53,980
I guess

513
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:57,233
you are one of the chess pieces here.

514
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:00,903
But you don't seem to know anything.

515
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,584
That's right.

516
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:17,628
Yes. That was my area until last month.

517
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:18,838
-Miri-dong.
-I see.

518
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:21,132
Just a moment. Let's see.

519
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:24,302
You said the 3rd, right? The 3rd...

520
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:26,721
By the way, did something happen?

521
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,055
-No.
-There it is.

522
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,890
"Miri-dong." Yes, I was there.

523
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:34,562
That evening around 8 p.m., were you
at the restaurant behind Hui-suk's--

524
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:37,315
Hui-suk's Teahouse?
Their Shiquan Dabu tonic is very good.

525
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:38,274
-That's right.
-Yes.

526
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:41,986
-I need to check your dashcam.
-My dashcam? Sure.

527
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:44,238
RENDEZVOUS RESTAURANT

528
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,157
HUI-SUK'S TEAHOUSE

529
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:47,992
That's Kim Pil-yeon.

530
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,454
-That's Jeong Sang-hun, right?
-Yes.

531
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:55,249
RENDEZVOUS RESTAURANT

532
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:02,006
Hey, where's this dashcam footage from?

533
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:04,133
It's from the supplier's delivery truck.

534
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:08,095
Look.

535
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:15,269
What are they saying?

536
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:20,816
What?

537
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:23,402
So the person
who took Jeong was--

538
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:24,945
It was the driver of that car.

539
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:27,365
-Whose car is it?
-The vehicle registration is fake.

540
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:30,117
Kim Pil-yeon ran out first,
so it obviously wasn't him.

541
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:32,620
It must've been Choi Chi-deuk.

542
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,622
Didn't he say he knows
where Jeong is?

543
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:35,790
I'm not sure.

544
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:39,668
Anyway, look through
all the traffic camera footage

545
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:41,504
and find out where this van went.

546
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:44,256
Comb through them.
This was the last time he was seen.

547
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,216
-Yes, sir.
-Yes.

548
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,842
You mean, now?

549
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:48,803
-Will you do it later, then?
-I'm on it.

550
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:57,353
Hey, Ho-gyu.

551
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:02,983
Come here.

552
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:07,613
Find out who bought Choi Chi-deuk's land.

553
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:09,824
Let's see.

554
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:10,908
BUSINESS REGISTRATION

555
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:12,535
"Muyeon Industries"?

556
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:16,163
They bought Choi Chi-deuk's land
that's worth 20 billion won

557
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:17,456
for only five billion won.

558
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,460
"CEO Son Du-gang."

559
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:24,213
Son Du-gang?

560
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:26,048
Son Du-gang.

561
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:28,092
Son Du-gang?

562
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,554
Thank you.

563
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:34,140
What?

564
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:37,226
Is he still sleeping here?

565
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:39,770
Sir.

566
00:40:40,729 --> 00:40:43,649
You really need to quit drinking.
It'll wreck your stomach.

567
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:46,944
-Okay?
-Mr. Son, we've seen enough of you.

568
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:49,697
Mr. Son's guardian,
please take him immediately.

569
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:00,124
Son Du-gang.

570
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,376
PERSONAL INFORMATION

571
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,919
Age, 67.

572
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:06,130
He has no family.

573
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:09,341
In 1994, he served a jail sentence
due to a DUI accident.

574
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:11,135
What? He's an ex-convict?

575
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,598
A dine and dash?

576
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:18,642
In 2001, 2003, and 2019.

577
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:22,188
This man bought that land?

578
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:25,524
Gosh, why are you being like this?

579
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:28,569
Dong-gu...

580
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:39,955
Don't ever call me again
for something like this.

581
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:44,502
Dong-gu...

582
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:04,355
Dong-gu...

583
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:07,566
Excuse me.

584
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:10,945
Here's your sea bass with wine sauce.

585
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:13,948
He's allergic to cucumber.

586
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:15,991
We informed the kitchen staff.

587
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:19,203
I apologize. I'll have them make it again.

588
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:23,082
I'm sorry, sir.
I should have double-checked.

589
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:25,167
We'll change the place from now on.

590
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,911
SPECIAL BILL PROPOSAL
PRINT

591
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:18,596
Hello?

592
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:21,223
Hello, I'm calling
from Songju Police Station.

593
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:24,226
We've finished inspecting Mr. Jeong's car.

594
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:27,479
When would you be able
to pick up the vehicle?

595
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:35,487
All right, let's look for the vehicle.
The one registered under a fake name.

596
00:43:36,071 --> 00:43:37,239
This is Songju.

597
00:43:38,907 --> 00:43:39,867
It just passed by.

598
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:43,162
-Where?
-Jeez.

599
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:45,664
You've already missed it so many times.

600
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:47,458
Can't you write down the time?

601
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:49,752
Well, I was just about to do that.

602
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:52,421
Are you annoyed with me?

603
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:56,467
You keep making me
do the same thing twice.

604
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:59,637
You're weird for being able
to spot that car right away.

605
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:03,140
-Your vision is unnecessarily good.
-I'm in the Traffic Division, you know.

606
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,811
Good point. Let's see.

607
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:11,190
-Right here.
-Here?

608
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:16,945
He got in the car voluntarily,
so it must've been someone he knows.

609
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:24,161
I hear someone saying something,
but it isn't audible.

610
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:36,423
Jeez, what's he saying?

611
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:40,636
-What about the rest?
-I'll be back tomorrow.

612
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:42,304
-It's so loud.
-You can't be late.

613
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:44,431
-Tae-sik.
-I've never been late.

614
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,558
Have some manners.

615
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:48,477
Use your earphones, please.

616
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,603
That rude punk.

617
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:52,106
She thinks she's the boss.

618
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:56,860
Damn it.

619
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:04,743
Yes, this is Jo Tae-sik
in the Regional Investigation Unit.

620
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,374
How are you going to take the car?

621
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:14,211
Shall I push it all the way
to the tollgate for you?

622
00:45:17,172 --> 00:45:18,924
You have a spare key.

623
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:25,347
What's going on with Choi Chi-deuk?

624
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:28,851
You probably saw on the news.
He's gone missing.

625
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:31,729
I think we can assume that he's dead.

626
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:38,360
I feel like I'm getting struck
by lightning every day.

627
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:42,740
But that phone call...

628
00:45:44,783 --> 00:45:47,202
It was so late at night. I'm sorry.

629
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:54,042
Maybe you'll know
since you're an assemblywoman.

630
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:56,378
-About what?
-You know, that thing.

631
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:58,839
That "new energy" something.
It has a long name.

632
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:02,509
-What about it?
-The lot for the new business.

633
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:06,805
That is the only common denominator
among the victims so far.

634
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:10,809
Songju RMC,
where Kim Pil-yeon used to work, is there.

635
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:13,353
And Choi Chi-deuk bought
all the land in that area.

636
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:17,900
But your husband and your father
tried to move the project to elsewhere.

637
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:21,445
-It may be related to--
-They wanted to change the location?

638
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:23,906
Sorry?

639
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:26,825
Didn't you know?

640
00:46:45,093 --> 00:46:46,136
Hi, Mom.

641
00:46:49,097 --> 00:46:50,641
No, I'm in Songju.

642
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:53,268
I'm going to sleep here tonight.

643
00:46:53,352 --> 00:46:55,145
I had dinner. Don't worry.

644
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:58,148
You should call the housekeeper
to clean the house.

645
00:46:58,357 --> 00:47:00,692
It's been empty for a while,
so it's probably messy.

646
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:03,570
Don't sleep there tonight.

647
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:05,405
FROM KIM SEUNG-CHEOL

648
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:07,658
Hey, Seo-hui.

649
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:21,880
"Dear members of Songju RMC Labor Union.

650
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:27,386
We've already known each other
for over 20 years.

651
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:30,138
Thanks to your support,

652
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:33,976
I could embark on this journey
with new aspirations and goals."

653
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:36,061
"But my misjudgment

654
00:47:36,144 --> 00:47:40,357
hugely disappointed all of you, who have
been supporting me all these years.

655
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:43,986
I feel horrible for what happened
even as I'm writing this.

656
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:47,865
You trusted my words
that I will protect the factory

657
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:50,826
and have been persevering
in this tough fight.

658
00:47:51,326 --> 00:47:54,288
First, I'd like to apologize
and thank all of you.

659
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:57,332
I, Kim Seung-cheol,

660
00:47:57,833 --> 00:47:59,835
give you my word once again.

661
00:48:01,086 --> 00:48:04,965
I will do everything in my power
to make sure your workplace stays intact.

662
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:09,845
I assure you that the bill will not pass.

663
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:12,055
As long as I am alive,

664
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:15,267
I will hold out
until the end of this fight.

665
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:19,730
March 3, from Kim Seung-cheol.

666
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:27,070
He wrote this on the day
that he passed away.

667
00:48:27,654 --> 00:48:29,323
TO SONGJU RMC LABOR UNION

668
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:30,657
"Return to sender"?

669
00:48:31,491 --> 00:48:33,285
The lot for the new business.

670
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:36,663
That is the only common denominator
among the victims so far.

671
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:39,333
But your husband and your father

672
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:41,793
tried to move the project
to elsewhere.

673
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:44,796
Dad,

674
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:48,133
you were against this bill?

675
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,471
-There are three boxes.
-You can leave them here.

676
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:54,181
Yes, it's this part.

677
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:56,808
Can you capture the voice
coming from inside the car?

678
00:48:57,059 --> 00:48:57,893
I'll try.

679
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:01,897
You can leave them here.

680
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:04,274
-What about the rest?
-I'll be back tomorrow.

681
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:05,943
-You can't be late.
-For this part,

682
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:08,403
is it possible to remove
the background noise?

683
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:10,030
I'll lower her voice.

684
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:12,824
-Okay.
-You can leave them here.

685
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:15,077
-What about the rest?
-Please get in, Mr. Jeong.

686
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,370
Can I hear that again?

687
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:19,539
-Please get in, Mr. Jeong.
-Just a second.

688
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:27,130
Why did you go to Songju RMC last night?

689
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:29,216
I needed to wrap up a contract.

690
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:33,470
Well, Mr. Jeong...

691
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:34,471
Play it again.

692
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,682
-Well, Mr. Jeong
-Please get in, Mr. Jeong.

693
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:38,767
has never handled
a project like this before.

694
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:42,229
-Well, Mr. Jeong
-Please get in, Mr. Jeong.

695
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:44,314
has never handled
a project like this before.

696
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:54,074
A shining day

697
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:56,076
Ms. Kim?

698
00:49:58,787 --> 00:50:00,205
Come on in.

699
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:05,419
Tae-sik, we've found out
where the van was last seen.

700
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:06,753
-Really?
-Yes.

701
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:07,754
Where?

702
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:11,258
-Is that it?
-Yes, it's In Dong-gu's car.

703
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:12,801
Where is that place?

704
00:50:12,884 --> 00:50:14,302
It's Yanggaeng-myeon.

705
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:16,805
It's Yanggye-myeon.
It's a town in Gangneung.

706
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:19,891
-Gangneung?
-Why did they go all the way to Gangneung?

707
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:21,435
-It was last seen here?
-Yes.

708
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:25,480
That means Jeong Sang-hun is in Gangneung.

709
00:50:25,897 --> 00:50:29,234
See if there's a place in the area
that has any connection to In Dong-gu.

710
00:50:29,317 --> 00:50:31,695
Yes, do your best.

711
00:50:31,778 --> 00:50:34,072
I'll head to Gangneung right away.

712
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:38,618
Here.

713
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:40,787
Try one.

714
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:44,833
I'm addicted to these cookies these days.
They're so good. They're not too sweet.

715
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:48,170
-Assemblywoman Baek.
-Yes, what is it?

716
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:50,922
Was my father...

717
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:52,841
Assemblyman Kim?
What about him?

718
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:57,095
The new business project...

719
00:50:57,763 --> 00:51:00,932
-The new business project?
-Yes, I'm talking about the bill.

720
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:05,812
I'm wondering if my dad was against it.

721
00:51:07,814 --> 00:51:09,066
What are you talking about?

722
00:51:13,862 --> 00:51:18,158
This letter was returned to our address
in Songju yesterday. My dad wrote it.

723
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:22,204
He wrote this letter?

724
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:26,708
From the letter, it sounds like
my dad was against the project.

725
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:31,922
But why is everyone telling me otherwise?

726
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:34,508
Assemblywoman Kim,
I'll look into this. All right?

727
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:37,469
-Don't worry. Have some tea.
-Okay.

728
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:42,057
Those American crime shows are to blame.

729
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:45,560
Find everything in Gangneung
that has connection to Mr. In.

730
00:51:46,394 --> 00:51:49,022
Does he think I can find
things with just one click?

731
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:56,363
In Dong-gu. Place of birth, no.

732
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:59,449
Did he go to college there? No.

733
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:03,620
There doesn't seem to be any connection.
Why did he go there?

734
00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:07,457
FAMILY RELATION

735
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:10,877
All right, his family.
He doesn't have a father.

736
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:12,754
And his mother passed away.

737
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:17,008
Mother, In Yeong-mi.

738
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:18,593
Place of birth...

739
00:52:19,052 --> 00:52:20,011
It's not Gangneung.

740
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:23,390
No connections.

741
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:26,893
I don't see any connections.

742
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:28,228
NOTES

743
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:32,774
From 1994 to 2004,
she was at Yanggye...

744
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:35,569
"Yanggye Mental Hospital"?

745
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:37,404
GANGNEUNG

746
00:52:38,071 --> 00:52:40,574
Yanggye-myeon, Gangneung.

747
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:42,450
YANGGYE MENTAL HOSPITAL

748
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:43,827
Yanggye Mental Hospital.

749
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:47,664
All right. In Dong-gu was last caught
on the footage in Yanggye-myeon,

750
00:52:47,747 --> 00:52:50,417
and his mother was hospitalized
at Yanggye Mental Hospital.

751
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:53,920
Okay. That means In Dong-gu
is familiar with Yanggye-myeon.

752
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:57,299
And we can assume
that he took Jeong Sang-hun

753
00:52:58,091 --> 00:53:01,720
to Yanggye Mental Hospital,

754
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:03,513
can we?

755
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:07,309
Is it too far-fetched?

756
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:15,233
I'm not sure if this is relevant,

757
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:17,235
but he does seem to have a connection

758
00:53:17,652 --> 00:53:19,446
to the place where he was last seen.

759
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:21,448
There's a record that shows

760
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:25,410
his mother was hospitalized
at Yanggye Mental Hospital for many years.

761
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:27,495
YANGGYE MENTAL HOSPITAL

762
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:30,665
I doubt that Jeong Sang-hun is here.

763
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:33,293
If he's actually here,

764
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:35,337
I'll gladly carry him home on my back.

765
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:38,465
Why are you being like this?

766
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:40,550
We can't show you anything
without a warrant.

767
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:43,428
Gosh! You've never requested
a warrant yourself, have you?

768
00:53:43,511 --> 00:53:47,599
You probably think it's like getting
a copy of your certificate of residency.

769
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:50,644
The thing is, it takes a long time
for a warrant to be issued,

770
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:52,187
and we don't have time now.

771
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:54,356
-Still, we can't show you.
-Darn it.

772
00:53:58,485 --> 00:53:59,444
Then let's do this.

773
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:02,322
You make a compromise,
and I'll do the same.

774
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:05,283
I'll look at it with only one eye.
We're good now?

775
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:07,369
-Wait!
-It's okay.

776
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:09,454
It's all right.

777
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:11,456
Show them.

778
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:14,793
I'll go with you.

779
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:16,628
Sure.

780
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:19,172
It's okay. Get back to work.

781
00:54:23,718 --> 00:54:24,719
Assemblywoman Kim.

782
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:27,681
You got here fast.
There was no traffic?

783
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:28,682
No.

784
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:30,433
Mr. Hong is over there.

785
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:35,146
Nice shot, sir!

786
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:38,400
Oh, my. Good shot!

787
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:40,819
Assemblywoman Kim.

788
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:44,406
I heard you think
your father was against the bill.

789
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:48,243
I've told you in a way
that you could understand.

790
00:54:48,326 --> 00:54:50,787
You just need to do as I say.

791
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:54,416
Do you think no one's above you
because I've been nice to you?

792
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:56,751
Who are you to even question it?

793
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:58,586
You used to run a coffee shop.

794
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:01,381
I took you under my wing
and got you a seat in the Assembly.

795
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:02,549
Are you all eager now?

796
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:05,844
-Sir.
-I don't need you to use your brain.

797
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:08,179
Know your place.

798
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:19,524
Why are you being like this?
Please don't do that.

799
00:55:19,607 --> 00:55:21,901
Why are you doing this? Please don't.

800
00:55:25,363 --> 00:55:26,656
Look, Assemblywoman Kim.

801
00:55:27,365 --> 00:55:31,077
Don't waste your time and energy.
Just go and propose that bill tomorrow.

802
00:55:32,871 --> 00:55:34,247
Or you'll end up
like your dad.

803
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:46,092
My gosh. No...

804
00:55:46,217 --> 00:55:47,969
Dad wrote this.

805
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:00,982
Our hospital

806
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:03,443
is not like walk-in clinics
or pediatric hospitals,

807
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:06,988
where dozens of patients
walk in and out all day long.

808
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:10,658
They could have used a different entrance.

809
00:56:10,742 --> 00:56:14,245
There's no road behind the building
because of the mountains.

810
00:56:14,412 --> 00:56:17,665
All cars and people
must enter through here.

811
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:20,251
Are you sure it's from March 3?

812
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:21,669
Don't you see the date?

813
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:25,507
Right.
Take a picture of it.

814
00:56:26,966 --> 00:56:28,510
-Of the footage?
-Yes.

815
00:56:37,685 --> 00:56:39,229
Thank you for your cooperation.

816
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:42,982
-Take care.
-Take care.

817
00:56:46,945 --> 00:56:47,946
Did you see that?

818
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:49,489
See what?

819
00:56:52,325 --> 00:56:54,327
-The moon?
-Show me the photo you took.

820
00:56:58,331 --> 00:57:00,458
Today is the 16th.

821
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:03,461
-There was a full moon on the 3rd?
-What?

822
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:06,631
They changed the date.

823
00:57:07,882 --> 00:57:10,510
You mean, they manipulated the footage?

824
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:14,139
Then what should the moon
have looked like?

825
00:57:14,222 --> 00:57:15,974
How many full moons are in a month?

826
00:57:16,057 --> 00:57:17,600
Twice, every 15 days.

827
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:19,477
You fool. You got it all wrong.

828
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:21,271
You only see it once a month.

829
00:58:13,781 --> 00:58:15,450
MET KIM SEUNG-CHEOL, JEONG SANG-HUN

830
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:21,247
KIM PIL-YEON, DEAD

831
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:23,875
ADDRESS, KIM PIL-YEON
YU DAE-YONG, SENIOR DETECTIVE

832
00:58:23,958 --> 00:58:25,460
JO TAE-SIK, DETECTIVE

833
00:58:25,543 --> 00:58:28,087
KANG JIN-GYEONG, DETECTIVE
JEON HO-GYU, DETECTIVE

834
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:29,172
KIM'S ACCIDENT SCENE

835
00:59:09,921 --> 00:59:12,048
An accident? What kind of accident, sir?

836
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:16,010
Tell him that he has to keep
his promise now.

837
00:59:16,177 --> 00:59:18,012
The Jeong Sang-hun
we're looking for...

838
00:59:18,596 --> 00:59:19,722
Who is he, really?

839
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:22,600
If things go wrong
both you and I will be screwed.

840
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:23,601
You know it, right?

841
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:26,187
Where did you take him? Where is Sang-hun?

842
00:59:26,271 --> 00:59:28,398
If they planted someone
inside the hospital...

843
00:59:28,481 --> 00:59:29,983
Then it makes sense, right?

844
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:32,944
What if we sneak in?
We'll find something about Jeong Sang-hun.

845
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:36,447
I found it. I know
what the hospital is trying to hide.
