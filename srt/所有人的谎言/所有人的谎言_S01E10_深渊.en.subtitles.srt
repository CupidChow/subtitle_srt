00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:42,000
THIS DRAMA IS A WORK OF FICTION.
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,

2
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,836
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGIONS, AND INCIDENTS
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

SEOUL POLICE AGENCY

4
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:51,760
Lieutenant Jo Tae-sik.

5
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:54,971
Why did you dig into a case from the past

6
00:00:55,054 --> 00:00:57,599
without even receiving any approval
from your superiors?

7
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:03,605
I thought the case was relevant
to the case we're currently investigating.

8
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:05,106
How is it relevant?

9
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:08,359
How does the disappearance
of JQ Group’s heir

10
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:10,236
have anything to do

11
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,322
with the suicide of a reporter?

12
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:14,491
I’d really like to know
what made you carry out

13
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,035
such a reckless investigation.

14
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,664
Who made that judgment?

15
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:26,878
It's not like one person
made that judgment on his or her own.

16
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:30,215
We all investigated the case together.
It wasn't just one person.

17
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,425
Fine, let's just say I did it.

18
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:35,011
As I was investigating the case
on Jeong Sang-hun,

19
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:37,680
I found out that his eye
went to the newspaper agency.

20
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:40,433
And you're telling me
that among all those employees,

21
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:42,352
you just happened to investigate
Choe Su-hyeon?

22
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:45,063
Do you think that makes sense?

23
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:46,940
Why doesn't it make sense?

24
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:50,193
As we were going through
Jeong Sang-hun's case,

25
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,572
we figured it had something to do
with Choe Su-hyeon's case.

26
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:56,449
-That's why Tae-sik--
-That means he gave you

27
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:57,826
the orders.

28
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:59,536
-What?
-You secretly

29
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:02,163
carried out an autopsy
by forging the captain's approval

30
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:04,582
because Lieutenant Jo asked you to.
Am I correct?

31
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,836
Why do you keep concluding it like that?

32
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:10,505
You're really making me feel flustered.

33
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:14,300
You know what?
I get that you're trying to protect him.

34
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:16,469
But you need to tell me the truth.

35
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:19,305
Why can't you give me an answer?

36
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,683
Let me ask you one more time.

37
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:24,769
Do you admit that you illegally logged in
with Detective Yu's user ID

38
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:27,313
and forged an official document?

39
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:29,607
Do you admit it or not?

40
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,443
Yes, I admit it.

41
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,989
You don't seem like you mean that.

42
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:41,536
I have to say, you must feel
really upset about all this.

43
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,039
I heard you got transferred to this team
against your will.

44
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,084
Look at what you're going through
because of your superior.

45
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:49,961
He completely ruined your career.

46
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:52,422
But,

47
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:54,841
there is a way out of this.

48
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:57,510
You're pretty close

49
00:02:58,386 --> 00:02:59,804
with Lieutenant Jo, right?

50
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:02,015
You worked together for quite a while.

51
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,641
Yes.

52
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:07,979
My gosh, it says here
that you worked with him for ten years.

53
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,940
Is that a problem?

54
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:13,902
I'm not sure.

55
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,321
That depends on

56
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:18,990
what you decide to tell me.

57
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,076
Captain Yu.

58
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:25,622
You were totally unaware
of what your teammates were doing

59
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:28,499
behind your back, right?

60
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:32,378
Yes, that's correct.
Captain Yu knew nothing about this.

61
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:37,508
Jin-gyeong and Ho-gyu were also
just following my orders.

62
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:40,762
They had no say or control
over what they were doing.

63
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:42,513
Well,

64
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:45,266
that's what we already thought.

65
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:50,021
Lieutenant Jo,
you know this is a serious issue, right?

66
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,608
Forging an official document
is a criminal case.

67
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:57,904
The disciplinary committee
will take this very seriously.

68
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:21,195
BOTTOMLESS PIT

69
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,364
INTERROGATION ROOM

70
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,618
KIM SEO-HUI

71
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:30,038
She called me so many times.

72
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,248
Why aren't you answering your phone?

73
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,250
I'll be on my way.
See you at the police station.

74
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,460
I have something to tell you.

75
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,045
I guess she would've come and left.

76
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:38,588
KIM SEO-HUI

77
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,430
Hey, where are you?

78
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:49,891
What?

79
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,405
What happened?

80
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:08,159
-It's not a big deal.
-What are you talking about?

81
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,912
I heard your car got destroyed.

82
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:14,540
Did you see the vehicle or the driver?

83
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,334
No.

84
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:21,672
What's wrong?

85
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,433
Are you looking for something?

86
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:33,559
Where did it go?

87
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,395
I'm sure I put it here.

88
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:37,855
What is it?

89
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,111
Seo-hui.

90
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:46,823
The flash drive.

91
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,242
What?

92
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:58,501
Didn't I tell you

93
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:01,879
not to hurt Seo-hui?

94
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:10,930
I went to the library and found the book
that Choe Su-hyeon had hidden.

95
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:13,891
I took it home and opened it

96
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,102
and found a flash drive inside.

97
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:24,986
It seemed like she hid it there
so no one could find it.

98
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,456
So I opened the file.

99
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,041
"Gu Jin-ju..."

100
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:42,044
-But my laptop suddenly froze.
-What? What's going on?

101
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:45,840
I got really scared and wanted to see you.

102
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:48,342
So I took the flash drive
and came out of my house.

103
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:52,263
And on my way to see you,
I got into an accident.

104
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,436
I don't think the accident
happened by coincidence.

105
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:01,272
The laptop suddenly froze,
and I suddenly got into an accident.

106
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:03,316
None of that feels like a coincidence.

107
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:05,485
I think the culprit wanted
to take the flash drive

108
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:07,570
after having found out that I had it.

109
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,113
What was in the flash drive?

110
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,867
I barely got to see the first page.

111
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:16,370
GO YEON-U, GU JIN-JU,
GI HAN-YEONG, KIM YUN-JU

112
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,873
It looked like a list for something.

113
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:20,625
"A list"?

114
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:29,550
Choe Su-hyeon had left a copy
of the file inside this flash drive.

115
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,970
Do you still think
I shouldn't have done anything?

116
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:36,557
How are you going to deal with this?

117
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:41,979
I know you're very competent.

118
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:44,815
But we shouldn't let our guard down.

119
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,570
It seems like you're going easy on her
because she's your friend.

120
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,074
But that might get you in trouble.

121
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:55,451
You should've just finished her.

122
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,163
Why did you spare her life?

123
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:04,627
It's because you know
that we still need Seo-hui.

124
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:09,423
Isn't that why you didn't hurt her enough

125
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,509
to kill her?

126
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:16,806
IN DONG-GU

127
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:18,975
Mr. In.

128
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,811
From now on,

129
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:24,689
don't you dare

130
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:27,692
make a move without my consent.

131
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:34,198
You don't want to cause trouble
before the bill gets passed.

132
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,878
I'm not as patient as the chairman.

133
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,482
It looked like a list of names.

134
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:12,111
There were people's names and addresses.

135
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:16,824
The file was named "List,"
but it didn't say what kind of list.

136
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:18,784
"Go..."

137
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:24,081
Okay, that's enough.

138
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,002
You should get some rest.
You might remember it out of the blue.

139
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:30,671
Oh, I almost forgot.

140
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:34,133
I'll have someone investigate
the hit-and-run case.

141
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:35,718
Who?

142
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,512
Why aren't you going to investigate it?

143
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,516
I should look into it as well.

144
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,644
Get some rest.

145
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,648
I, Lieutenant Jo Tae-sik, am here

146
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,858
to receive my penalty
from the disciplinary committee.

147
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:57,031
We will now begin the meeting
regarding Lieutenant Jo Tae-sik

148
00:10:57,865 --> 00:11:00,534
who is suspected of having forged
an official document.

149
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:02,995
Lieutenant Jo Tae-sik.

150
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:06,040
Do you admit that you've forcefully
proceeded with investigating a case

151
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,959
without having reported it
to your superiors?

152
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,045
Yes, I do.

153
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:17,009
You've neglected the hierarchical system
of the police force

154
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:20,179
and forged an official document.

155
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:22,390
That is a violation of Article 227
of the Criminal Law

156
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:26,102
which could put you in jail
for a maximum of seven years.

157
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:29,397
Therefore, the disciplinary committee
has decided to demote you

158
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,358
and give you a suspension of six months.

159
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:42,535
Director In stepped up
and did what he had to do.

160
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:46,455
He did the right thing
by getting rid of Jo Tae-sik.

161
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,499
But he still shouldn't

162
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,668
have hurt Seo-hui.

163
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:55,881
Sir. I'm worried how Director In keeps
crossing the line.

164
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:59,593
It will end up backfiring on us for sure.

165
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:04,515
He does tend to cross the line at times.

166
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,643
That also worries me.

167
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:09,687
But,

168
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,898
it's not like Seo-hui died.

169
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,695
I care about her

170
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,114
like my own child.

171
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:23,534
And we also need her

172
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,954
for next year's general election.

173
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:44,763
Dae-yong.

174
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:53,314
You fool.

175
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:57,026
I'm sorry.

176
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,073
You know what I mean, right?

177
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:09,997
Here's our next news.

178
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,917
Today, the police announced
that they'll be

179
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,629
replacing the team that was in charge
of investigating the disappearance

180
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:20,049
of JQ’s CEO, Jeong Sang-hun,
with a whole new team.

181
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:23,260
According to an insider,
they say it was an inevitable choice

182
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:25,888
due to the reckless investigation method
carried out by the person

183
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,140
-They're replacing the team?
-who was initially in charge

184
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:31,101
and that it won’t cause any troubles
regarding the investigation.

185
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:03,300
JEONG SANG-HUN'S DISAPPEARANCE

186
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,780
JEONG SANG-HUN'S DISAPPEARANCE

187
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,366
How am I going to find you now?

188
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:48,554
PLEASE TURN OFF THE LIGHTS

189
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,649
I guess this is really the end.

190
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,777
I kind of liked this place.

191
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,286
I guess this is our last meal in Songju.

192
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:17,499
I was really annoyed
when I first got dispatched to Songju.

193
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:21,295
I had no idea how I was going to live
in the countryside.

194
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:23,797
What? You loved it here.
It was as if this was your hometown.

195
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:27,968
Now that I got used to this place,
I'm being sent back.

196
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,387
They really do everything as they please.

197
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,476
To be really honest,

198
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,437
I'm a little disappointed in Captain Yu.

199
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:41,148
They totally got rid of our team,

200
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,026
but he just stood there and watched.

201
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,612
He has no power to stop this.

202
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:48,656
I shouldn't have overreacted.

203
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:51,075
I was too reckless and blinded by passion.

204
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:55,788
Where are you guys going?

205
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,375
I got demoted and got dispatched

206
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,460
to a precinct station.

207
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:05,047
But he got dispatched
to the Information Division.

208
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,049
The Information Division?

209
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:11,553
WRITTEN STATEMENT

210
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,389
If you sign this

211
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,766
written statement,

212
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:18,852
I'll report to the superiors
that you had nothing to do

213
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,896
with this case.

214
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,398
WRITTEN STATEMENT

215
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:26,443
You don't want to end your career
as a corporal, do you?

216
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:31,824
IN MAY 3, 2019, I RECEIVED ORDERS
FROM LIEUTENANT JO TAE-SIK...

217
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:33,450
JEON HO-GYU

218
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:43,794
JEON HO-GYU

219
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:49,758
That's great.
You always wanted to go there.

220
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:54,680
They're probably taking him
because they know he's smart.

221
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:57,224
I know, right? He's such a bright kid.

222
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,310
Anyway, thanks for working so hard.

223
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:01,603
Cheers.

224
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:05,899
Once you get dispatched, don't do anything
that requires too much work.

225
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,651
Keep a low profile,

226
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:10,029
and slack around from time to time
just like all the others.

227
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:12,114
You're the one who shouldn't try so hard.

228
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:14,658
Stop taking care of everyone else.

229
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,327
What's with you?

230
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:20,372
Why do you have to be so pessimistic?

231
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:23,584
Hey, this isn't the end for us.

232
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:27,504
We'll get to investigate the case again,
and drink together just like this.

233
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:30,549
Right? We need to get back together
and investigate the case again.

234
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:33,052
We can't let everything go to waste.

235
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,763
You told me you're suspicious
of Assemblywoman Kim's accident.

236
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:37,723
If we just give up like this,

237
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:41,185
it'll make us feel really uncomfortable.

238
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:43,145
Anyway,

239
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:46,190
we'll forever be a team.

240
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:49,193
So call us whenever if you need any help.

241
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,163
PATIENT: KIM SEO-HUI

242
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:04,750
Come in.

243
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,340
They let you leave already?

244
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:15,010
No, I told them that I want to leave.

245
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:19,098
It seems like everyone's packing today.

246
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:23,310
-Seo-hui--
-I'm sorry.

247
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:26,688
About what?

248
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:30,025
I saw the news
and heard that you got suspended.

249
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:32,111
Oh, you heard about that?

250
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:36,115
My gosh, that wasn't even
a newsworthy topic.

251
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:41,286
Gosh, it's okay.

252
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,498
That kind of stuff happens often
when you investigate a case.

253
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:48,418
Plus, I was always at the police station,
so I never really had enough time.

254
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,547
Now, I'll be able to focus
on the investigation.

255
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,299
You're going to keep investigating?

256
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,593
Why wouldn't I?

257
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,303
Well, I mean...

258
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,850
Do you think I'm useless
now that I don't have my police badge?

259
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,732
Like I said, I want to do it properly

260
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:12,234
this time.

261
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,405
Is this all?

262
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,490
It's okay. I'll carry it.

263
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,201
Get some rest while you can.
That will help you recover.

264
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,506
-Did you eat breakfast?
-I'm okay.

265
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:36,592
I heard there's a problem

266
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,219
with the Judiciary Committee.

267
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:41,805
They couldn't reach an agreement.

268
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,392
The opposition party
is trying to draw things out.

269
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,729
I think they're trying to pass it
onto the subcommittee

270
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:50,898
and stop the bill from being discussed

271
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,150
at the general meeting.

272
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:57,779
Mr. Hong is going to meet the delegate
of the opposition party today.

273
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:00,199
I'll let you know about the results.

274
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:07,956
SONGJU

275
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,418
One thing I know
is that all the addresses were in Songju.

276
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,128
SONGJU, GANGWON PROVINCE

277
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:15,881
"Gongwon-ri."

278
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:17,216
GONGWON-RI

279
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:21,094
GO HYEONG-U

280
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:27,643
GO HYEONG-U, GO YEON-U

281
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:29,937
"Go Hyeong..."

282
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,941
GU JIN-JU

283
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,150
"Gu..."

284
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:37,819
"Gu Jin-ju"?

285
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,865
-You jerk!
-Stop it.

286
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,409
-Who do you think you are?
-Will you please stop?

287
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:46,662
-How dare you?
-Who do you think you are?

288
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:48,872
Get out of my face!

289
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,457
My gosh.

290
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,542
This is Seo-hui's laptop.

291
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,294
Find out if this can be restored.

292
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:57,839
I don't expect much from you,
but I might be wrong.

293
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:01,426
Of all the things, why did it have to be
the one thing I'm really bad at?

294
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,428
Damn it.

295
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,640
Who do you think you are?

296
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:09,518
JEON HO-GYU

297
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,357
Let's not bother him.

298
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,194
Corporal Kang!

299
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,737
Yes, sir?

300
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:24,074
-Calm down.
-Did you ask for me?

301
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:25,951
-Isn't that why you're here?
-Yes, sir!

302
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:27,286
If you're done with your break,

303
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,663
I want you to control the traffic
in the other neighborhood

304
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:31,790
because they're currently
having their roads repaired.

305
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:33,709
-Right now, sir?
-Yes, right now!

306
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,086
-Yes, sir!
-My gosh, you're so slow.

307
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:37,713
I wonder what goes on in your mind.

308
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,464
I'll be off now, sir!

309
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:47,681
JEONG SANG-HUN

310
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:49,641
THE INVESTIGATION TEAM HAS BEEN CHANGED

311
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,060
I wonder how things are going.

312
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,731
These files are from
Information Division 2 and 3.

313
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:58,608
I want you to organize them by today.
This won't take long, right?

314
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:01,278
-I have to organize all this?
-Why do you look so surprised?

315
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:03,280
This is easier than doing fieldwork.

316
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,157
You'll soon get the hang of it.

317
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,491
But...

318
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,288
Who?

319
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,540
Kim Seo-hui's accident?

320
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:24,051
Why are you calling us
to ask about a security camera defect?

321
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:26,845
You should be calling
the Digital Analysis Division.

322
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:28,847
Shouldn't you know that by now?

323
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:58,543
SONGJU POLICE STATION

324
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:01,421
"The security camera footage
in the vicinity has been checked,

325
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:04,508
but nothing was recorded
due to the mechanical defect."

326
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:06,927
NOTHING WAS RECORDED
DUE TO THE MECHANICAL DEFECT

327
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:09,012
INVESTIGATION PROGRESS

328
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:14,559
What are we having for lunch?

329
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:17,604
Tae-sik...

330
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,982
Let's just go to the cafeteria.

331
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:24,111
No. You go ahead and eat.

332
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:26,446
Okay. Let's go.

333
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:31,243
-Make sure to have lunch.
-Okay.

334
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:49,469
Darn it. Those jerks won't leave.

335
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:56,643
Who is he?

336
00:23:58,228 --> 00:23:59,437
I guess he's a gasman.

337
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:05,235
I'm here to check the gas appliances.

338
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:17,038
Hey.

339
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,373
Who is this?

340
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:21,501
-I'm here to check the gas appliances.
-Okay.

341
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:27,340
-Hello.
-Hello.

342
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,801
-Excuse me.
-Please come in.

343
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:43,106
Do you have any problems using it?

344
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,191
No.

345
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,944
Where's the boiler room?

346
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,613
This way.

347
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:00,123
It's important to ventilate

348
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:01,583
-the boiler room.
-I see.

349
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,512
It's quite dusty outside.

350
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:16,806
Would you like something to drink?

351
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:18,516
Yes, please.

352
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:20,644
Wait a moment.

353
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:25,315
Are we working all night again?

354
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:30,528
Who is he? Isn't he the gasman?

355
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:33,448
Hey, that's not what he was wearing.

356
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:35,617
Darn it!

357
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:47,295
Jo Tae-sik. Jo Tae-sik!

358
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:48,880
Gosh.

359
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:52,634
What was that? Where did he go?

360
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:54,427
What is going on?

361
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:11,486
Who is it?

362
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:13,488
Please open. I'm a cop.

363
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:15,949
What is going on?

364
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:18,285
Please excuse me.

365
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:25,333
I guess he jumped off here. Go that way.

366
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,836
Okay. Shoot.

367
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:39,681
What's up with your clothes?

368
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,850
They put a tail on me,
so I had to ditch them.

369
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:43,310
A tail?

370
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:47,689
I mean, they're from Internal Affairs.
Why are they working so hard?

371
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:52,610
Gosh, there you go again.

372
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,988
Stop wearing that expression.

373
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:59,909
Here. This is the accident report
you asked for.

374
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:02,746
I had to ask around to get it.

375
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:04,664
But it had nothing special.

376
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:07,208
There's no witness
or security camera footage.

377
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:09,002
Is that so?

378
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:11,963
Did you recall anything in the meantime?

379
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:13,965
Yes. But...

380
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:20,388
This is the list
I found in the flash drive.

381
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:22,974
Go Hyeong-u, Gu Jin-ju...

382
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,685
It had names, dates of birth,

383
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:28,229
addresses and stuff like that.

384
00:27:28,646 --> 00:27:30,482
But I recalled only two names.

385
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:32,150
And I'm not sure if it's correct.

386
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:34,778
It says Gongwon-ri, Yeongil-myeon,
Songju for both.

387
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:36,696
So they're both from the same village?

388
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,864
I guess so.

389
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:42,619
Why do you think
Choe Su-hyeon had this list?

390
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:45,413
We should go and meet them anyway.

391
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:20,615
Detective Kang.

392
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:24,285
Detective Kang.

393
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:27,414
-Ho-gyu.
-Come closer.

394
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,165
What are you doing here?

395
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:30,875
I just had lunch over there.

396
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:32,794
Jin-gyeong...

397
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:34,504
I mean, did you eat lunch?

398
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:37,340
Jin-gyeong? Are we friends now?

399
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:39,592
No, it's just a mistake.

400
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:42,178
Hey, you look so much better.

401
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:43,763
I bet you feel comfortable now.

402
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:45,265
Not really.

403
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:49,602
Now that we both stay in Seoul,
we run into each other. This is nice.

404
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:51,020
I know.

405
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,190
What about Detective Jo?

406
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:58,695
He's still working on it stealthily,
but it's not going well.

407
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:01,197
He doesn't have his badge,
and he's got a tail.

408
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,743
That's it. You don't have to worry.

409
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:07,203
Why not? We were a team.

410
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:10,206
We were a team, but not anymore.

411
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,792
Why do you even care
when you're in a different team?

412
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:14,878
-Still, I--
-Just go. The light changed.

413
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:17,714
-But--
-Go. Keep walking. Hurry.

414
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,966
Just go.

415
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:30,018
Detective Kang.

416
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:33,480
If there's anything I can do, tell me.

417
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:36,733
I'll wait.

418
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:40,487
Be careful.

419
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:45,742
Excuse me.

420
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:47,368
May I ask something?

421
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,746
Do you know a person named

422
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:52,540
Go Hyeong-u or Gu Jin-ju
in the neighborhood?

423
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,709
I don't know.

424
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:55,794
-You don't?
-No.

425
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:58,046
-Okay. Thank you.
-Sure.

426
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:06,012
Hello. May I ask you something?

427
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:10,099
Hello, ma'am. May I ask you something?

428
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:12,519
Have you heard of the name

429
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,479
-Go Hyeong-u and Gu Jin-ju?
-I know the name.

430
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:16,356
He lives next door.

431
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:19,984
-Hey.
-Yes?

432
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:21,486
Where do you live?

433
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:22,904
Over there.

434
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:25,281
Can you take us to your place?

435
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:34,374
Over there.

436
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:35,750
-Is this it?
-Yes.

437
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,794
Okay. Thank you. Go and play now.

438
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:39,629
Bye.

439
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:47,345
-Excuse me.
-No one's in the house now.

440
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:50,306
I see. Do you know where they are?

441
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:53,017
Jin-ju's family
is in the village hall now.

442
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:56,145
I see. Where is the village hall?

443
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:58,189
It's over there.

444
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:00,316
-Okay. Thank you.
-You're welcome.

445
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:35,226
What's the biggest problem?

446
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:38,897
The articles about
the taxation and national land.

447
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:42,942
We can discuss it as much as we please,

448
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:45,069
but the problem is
that we don't have time.

449
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:48,990
If the Judiciary Committee doesn't
pass the bill this week,

450
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:51,951
there's no way we can bring it up
at the general meeting next month.

451
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:54,871
Then we'll fail in the general
and presidential elections--

452
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:56,080
Concede it.

453
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:58,541
-Pardon?
-Go ahead and concede it.

454
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:01,961
-Yes, sir.
-Concede the articles

455
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,964
about tax support
and program management support.

456
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:09,260
Then JQ will suffer
a loss of about 40 billion won.

457
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:10,637
All we need

458
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:14,891
is the article
about the purchase of national land.

459
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:17,769
Yes, sir. I'll make sure to defend it.

460
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:20,313
The land

461
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:23,149
must be ours.

462
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:24,734
Yes, sir.

463
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:58,017
All right.

464
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:00,687
I didn't want to be there anyway.

465
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:03,356
I wanted to work
in the Information Division.

466
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:06,484
That filthy and damp motel room, gosh.

467
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:09,028
There's no place like home. It's clean.

468
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,282
TEXT MESSAGE

469
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:14,283
CHAUFFEUR SERVICE

470
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,078
Darn.

471
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:19,330
I can't believe this.

472
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:23,501
Now that we're not a team,
they don't even call me.

473
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,462
They are so heartless.

474
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:29,257
Gosh.

475
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,513
Who would it be at this hour?

476
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,141
Who is it?

477
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:40,518
The door is open.

478
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:45,106
What are you doing? How...
I mean, why are you here?

479
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,151
Hey, why are you pretending not to know?

480
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:51,237
Earlier today, you said, "Jin-gyeong."

481
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:53,906
If there's anything I can do, tell me.

482
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:58,327
"If you need my help,
make sure to call me."

483
00:33:58,578 --> 00:33:59,996
I'll wait.

484
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,248
"I'll wait."

485
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,667
-You said that, didn't you?
-I didn't sound so frivolous.

486
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,419
So is this your place?

487
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:08,296
Gosh, it looks pretty good.

488
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:11,215
Your shoes... Take off your socks.
Your socks.

489
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:13,801
-Gosh, look at the sofa.
-Darn it.

490
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,096
Gosh.

491
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,348
-Cool.
-You're so uncultured.

492
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:21,142
-Take off your socks.
-Take them off?

493
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:22,602
-Okay. Happy now?
-Wait.

494
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:25,271
-Don't put them...
-Here. I took them off.

495
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,192
Get down before I call the police.

496
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:30,943
You said you'd wait.

497
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:32,737
I didn't mean tonight.

498
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:35,073
You should try spending a whole day
directing traffic.

499
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:36,949
I'm so tired.

500
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:38,493
This is comfortable.

501
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,036
Where did you get this sofa?

502
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:42,163
-It's so nice.
-Just get down here.

503
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:43,623
It's done.

504
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:45,625
Thank you so much.

505
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:46,876
-Well done.
-Your kid.

506
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:48,586
It must've been hard.

507
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:51,964
Hello, ma'am. Is this girl Gu Jin-ju
by any chance?

508
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,217
She's my granddaughter.

509
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:57,345
-Who are you?
-May I ask you something?

510
00:34:57,845 --> 00:35:00,264
Do you know this woman?

511
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,226
-Why do you ask?
-Do you know her?

512
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:05,353
She was here
asking questions the other day.

513
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,939
So I kicked her out. Let's go, Jin-ju.

514
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:09,690
-Wait.
-Ma'am, but...

515
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:10,775
It's her.

516
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:12,360
You're Assemblyman Kim's daughter.

517
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:13,486
-That's right.
-Hello.

518
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:15,530
What are you doing here?

519
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,741
I was just wondering
if everything was okay.

520
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:21,994
You look just like your father.

521
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:23,955
May I ask you something?

522
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:27,625
Have you seen this woman
in this neighborhood before?

523
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:29,252
She does seem familiar.

524
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:31,045
-Oh, right.
-Did you see her?

525
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:33,673
She's the one who kept visiting

526
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:35,675
Mr. Go's house a few months ago.

527
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:37,844
Oh, that's right. I remember. It's her.

528
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:39,762
Mr. Go?

529
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:41,848
Are you talking about Go Hyeong-u?

530
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:43,975
-Go Hyeong-u?
-Well...

531
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:46,144
It's not Go Hyeong-u.

532
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:48,771
His son's name is Go Yeon-u.

533
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:50,898
-Right. It's Yeon-u.
-He's Yeon-u.

534
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:54,152
I see. Where is his house?

535
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:55,695
It's right over there.

536
00:35:56,696 --> 00:36:00,032
What do you think is in the flash drive?

537
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:02,535
It must be something important.

538
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:04,871
That's why the whole thing happened.

539
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,206
Why are you being quiet?

540
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,249
Well...

541
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:10,251
I'm not sure what's in it.

542
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:12,420
About the accident.

543
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:15,840
The hit-and-run accident
of Assemblywoman Kim.

544
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:19,510
The security cameras in the vicinity
were off at the moment of the accident.

545
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:22,388
Right at the moment of the accident.

546
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:25,558
Isn't it strange?

547
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:28,144
-It's very strange.
-I know.

548
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:32,773
What if someone deliberately deleted
the footage?

549
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:35,401
Someone inside the police.

550
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:37,320
Are you sure?

551
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:39,363
Who inside the police?

552
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:41,657
It's just a guess. I'm just saying it.

553
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:44,911
What we need now
is something we can be sure.

554
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:46,787
Concrete evidence.

555
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:50,166
Gosh, is that why
you're drinking some alcohol here?

556
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:51,626
You're not doing things right.

557
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:53,836
What did you just say?

558
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,214
-Come over here, you punk.
-Gosh.

559
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:58,257
How dare you say
such a thing to your senior?

560
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:00,301
-I'll just...
-It hurts.

561
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:03,846
Darn it.

562
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:06,015
Hey. I forgot something.

563
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,310
Here.

564
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:13,022
-What is this?
-Assemblywoman Kim's laptop.

565
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:15,858
I guess it got hacked or something.

566
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:18,277
I turned it off and on,
but it doesn't work.

567
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:20,238
The hacker should have
some sense of honor.

568
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:22,949
If it gets back on so easily,
we can't even call him a hacker.

569
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:25,701
And you Smarty-pants should have
some sense of honor.

570
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:27,453
A cop from the Information Division.

571
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,539
-Do you want to try?
-I knew you'd say that.

572
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:35,711
Tae-sik told me
not to put pressure on you.

573
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:38,839
But if we find out something,

574
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:40,883
it will help him get reinstated.

575
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:42,802
So? You said you wanted to see me.

576
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:45,012
But this is actually about Tae-sik.

577
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:48,474
No, it's not like that.

578
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:50,059
Are you emotionally deprived or what?

579
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:51,519
I'm not emotionally deprived.

580
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:54,021
Ho-gyu, I love you a lot.

581
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,564
You rascal.

582
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:57,358
-Hey.
-I knew it.

583
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:02,655
-Hello.
-Who are you?

584
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:04,740
Are you Go Yeon-u's father?

585
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:06,158
Yes. Why?

586
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:08,119
We're here to ask you something.

587
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,997
Do you know this woman?

588
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:12,957
She's a social worker.

589
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:25,845
It's been a few months
since my son is gone.

590
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:28,014
But I haven't got rid of his stuff yet.

591
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,099
I just couldn't do it.

592
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,810
What was ailing him?

593
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:34,729
He had lung cancer.

594
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:37,773
When he was first diagnosed with it,

595
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:40,359
I just couldn't believe it.

596
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:42,528
I don't even smoke.

597
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:44,697
And he was only nine. How...

598
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:47,325
Why did Choe Su-hyeon come to see you?

599
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:49,702
She said she worked at the city hall.

600
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:53,247
She asked some questions
saying she'd help us.

601
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:54,957
What did she ask?

602
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,587
She asked how long we'd been living here

603
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:02,048
and when my son had become ill.

604
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:05,801
This is Sang-hun.

605
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:09,430
Why is Sang-hun in that photo?

606
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:18,647
-Sir.
-What?

607
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:21,525
Have you ever tried to recover

608
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:23,444
a hacked laptop?

609
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:27,239
Why would you ask such an obvious
question? Of course I have.

610
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:30,076
Well, the laptop was hacked pretty badly.

611
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:33,412
I can't even turn on the laptop.
It's totally fried.

612
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:35,081
What happened to it?

613
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:37,124
Bring it.

614
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:38,501
I can't do that.

615
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:41,837
It's because of the files on the laptop.

616
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:45,049
Jeez. I didn't peg you
to gather such files.

617
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:47,218
-Pardon?
-First, disassemble

618
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:48,469
-the laptop.
-Hold on.

619
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:51,889
I'm ready.

620
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:53,808
First, disassemble the laptop.

621
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:56,227
Connect the hard drive
to a functioning laptop.

622
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:57,686
Run an anti-virus program.

623
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,188
Run it in each sector.

624
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:02,358
It's highly likely that it might've been
infected through an Internet server.

625
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:04,485
Make sure to redirect the VPN route first.

626
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:07,405
When you monitor all the traffic
that passes through other servers,

627
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:09,782
you'll figure out the source.

628
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:14,578
How do you know my husband?

629
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:17,748
The social worker visited us alone
for the first few times.

630
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:20,793
And she came with him afterward,
saying he's her husband.

631
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:22,336
Look.

632
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:26,549
-Do you want to kiss it, Yeon-u?
-No.

633
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:32,221
Actually, I adopted Yeon-u.

634
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:34,390
So after hearing that,

635
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:36,058
he tried to help us the best he could.

636
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:39,145
He switched us to a nice room
at the hospital.

637
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:41,313
And when I was busy,

638
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:43,482
he looked after my son for me.

639
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,444
I think that was
why Yeon-u was fond of him.

640
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:49,155
And he also

641
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:51,866
got this puppy for us.

642
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:53,951
It would have been nicer

643
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:57,288
if Yeon-u had more time to play with it.

644
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:00,833
I pronounce Patient Go Yeon-u

645
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:05,171
dead on February 5, 2019, at 6:30 p.m.

646
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,803
Yeon-u.

647
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:15,264
SONGJU HOSPITAL

648
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:17,266
Yeon-u.

649
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:24,690
Sir,

650
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:28,736
would it be all right
if I kept this photo?

651
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:40,122
How could he smile so broadly like this?

652
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:44,585
I thought he hated kids

653
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:49,465
because he said
he didn't want to have kids.

654
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:52,134
I'll do everything. Hear me out.

655
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:53,719
I'll feed,

656
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:55,888
wash, sleep,

657
00:41:55,971 --> 00:41:57,306
and love the baby.

658
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:00,392
I'll do everything for the baby.

659
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:02,353
You don't have to lift a finger.

660
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:04,188
What are you talking about?

661
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:06,482
Can't we have just one child?
Just one, please?

662
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:08,734
-I mean...
-Please.

663
00:42:08,817 --> 00:42:11,111
We can be a family of three, not two.

664
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:13,197
The baby will have your hair

665
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:15,824
and your nose. Fine, your eyebrows, too.

666
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:18,661
Eyes...

667
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:21,247
Yes, the baby should have
the color of my eyes.

668
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:25,209
The baby can have your nose and chin.

669
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:27,086
Seo-hui.

670
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:28,879
I'm just...

671
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:31,966
I'm not just confident to be a dad yet.

672
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,592
I'll take care of everything.

673
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:36,345
All you have to do is
just stay next to us.

674
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:41,517
I'm sorry, Seo-hui.

675
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:51,151
Back then,

676
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:54,405
I couldn't understand
why he didn't want a child.

677
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:57,491
That was why we drifted apart.

678
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:02,288
It's so upsetting to see him smile
like this in the photo.

679
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:04,540
I think I can understand him.

680
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,835
This is probably what he felt.

681
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:11,797
No matter how much
Chairman Jeong cherished him,

682
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:13,674
Chairman Jeong loved him

683
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,218
because Mr. Jeong resembled his late son.

684
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:19,430
He couldn't even tell his own wife
what his real name was

685
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:21,765
and where he had come from.

686
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:24,602
It was probably not easy

687
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:27,104
living someone else's life.

688
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:31,191
He had no idea
where he should put down his roots.

689
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:32,860
Given his circumstance,

690
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,697
he was probably uncertain about whether

691
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:39,491
he could become a good dad.

692
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:43,787
Perhaps, he might have seen himself

693
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:47,499
in that boy, Yeon-u.

694
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:49,960
This feels like crap.

695
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:55,382
Only after losing him,

696
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:58,927
I can understand how he must have felt.
That feels like crap.

697
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:02,139
You haven't lost him yet.

698
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:07,144
We must find Mr. Jeong.

699
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:11,940
When you see him again, tell him

700
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:15,527
to make up for everything

701
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:17,946
he put you through
for the rest of your life together.

702
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:21,325
Make sure to tell him that.

703
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:32,419
After that...

704
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:34,380
CONNECT THE HARD DRIVE

705
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:35,881
"Connect the hard drive.

706
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:39,635
Redirect the VPN route and monitor
the traffic in the other servers."

707
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:42,930
Will this actually work?

708
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:49,186
What? It worked.

709
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:51,230
KIM SEO-HUI

710
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:56,402
Let's see.

711
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:01,448
The virus code is

712
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:04,034
"Kebechet".

713
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:06,245
"Kebechet"?

714
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:10,707
VIRUS ON CHOE SU-HYEON'S FILE
KEBECHET

715
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:12,918
It's the same virus.

716
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:18,006
I see. It was done by the same hacker.

717
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:19,883
Okay, then.

718
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:21,427
HOW TO REVERSE HACK

719
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:23,303
"How to reverse hack.

720
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:25,556
Redirect the VPN route.

721
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:28,934
Monitor all the traffic

722
00:45:29,017 --> 00:45:32,396
that passes through other servers."

723
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:38,569
Let's see.

724
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:57,629
It's me. Someone
just hacked into my computer.

725
00:45:57,713 --> 00:46:00,424
I think the hacker is looking
for the list Kim Seo-hui saw.

726
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:02,968
Once I locate the hacker,
I'll call you again.

727
00:46:03,051 --> 00:46:04,052
Okay.

728
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:09,475
I'll stop the car over there.

729
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:11,268
-Here?
-Yes.

730
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:12,895
People are watching my house.

731
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:14,521
I'll go home on my own from here.

732
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:21,028
I'll look into the family
we visited today first.

733
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:22,404
And I'll call you, then.

734
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:23,489
Okay.

735
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:32,039
Detective Jo.

736
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:34,458
Thank you for today.

737
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:38,086
Drive safely.

738
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:47,763
GO YEON-U, GU JIN-JU

739
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:50,140
So he took this list from her?

740
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:57,356
Let me save it in my backup drive first.

741
00:46:58,524 --> 00:46:59,608
Then I'll print it.

742
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:02,194
PRINT

743
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:06,114
Wait, I need paper.

744
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:09,201
I'm out of paper.

745
00:47:12,287 --> 00:47:13,455
What's going on?

746
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:24,091
Look at this jerk.

747
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:27,844
He's hacking me again
because I saw this list?

748
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:29,763
Okay.

749
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:32,808
So this list is that important?

750
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:45,153
Why did Choe Su-hyeon go to that village?

751
00:47:45,612 --> 00:47:47,781
She asked how long we'd been living here

752
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:51,159
and when my son had become ill.

753
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:01,420
A shamanic ritual?

754
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:06,425
What were you trying to do, Sang-hun?

755
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,970
I wish someone could just tell me.

756
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:15,517
JQ SONGJU HOSPITAL

757
00:48:18,103 --> 00:48:19,479
JQ Hospital?

758
00:48:20,105 --> 00:48:21,106
JQ?

759
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:28,780
GO YEON-U

760
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:36,330
Hello?

761
00:48:37,914 --> 00:48:38,999
Yes.

762
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:41,335
That's right.

763
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:43,712
I just had a question.

764
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:47,299
Did Yeon-u get treated

765
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:48,925
at JQ Hospital?

766
00:48:50,802 --> 00:48:54,139
Yes. Yeon-u stayed at that hospital
until his last day.

767
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:58,435
I see. Thank you.

768
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:07,903
Hey, little one. Hold on.

769
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:11,657
Hold on.

770
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:17,746
Assemblywoman Kim.

771
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:23,210
How's your preparation
for the Judiciary Committee coming along?

772
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:25,921
-Yes.
-By the way,

773
00:49:27,422 --> 00:49:30,425
it looks like you're
in dire need of passing the bill.

774
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:32,803
-Pardon?
-It's about the bill for the new business.

775
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:35,222
You're giving up quite a lot for the bill.

776
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:39,017
But it's a business, after all.
It looks like you'll be only losing money.

777
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:40,727
I don't follow you.

778
00:49:41,603 --> 00:49:43,814
See? I find this intriguing.

779
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:46,191
Judging from your decisions,

780
00:49:46,274 --> 00:49:49,027
it looks like you're desperately
trying to pass the bill.

781
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:51,822
But seeing how you're not interested
in the content,

782
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:53,615
it makes me wonder
if that's what you want.

783
00:49:55,575 --> 00:49:57,369
Your goal is to pass the bill, isn't it?

784
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:00,580
What are you talking about?

785
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:01,540
Are you aware that

786
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:04,918
Mr. Hong met with
the representative of my party

787
00:50:05,001 --> 00:50:06,002
yesterday afternoon?

788
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:10,882
Then, I doubt that you know
what they discussed.

789
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:15,011
He must have thought

790
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:18,557
that the representative of my party
wouldn't pass the bill that easily.

791
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:22,227
Mr. Hong personally
made the trip to negotiate.

792
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:23,520
I'll tell you what he said.

793
00:50:24,396 --> 00:50:25,647
He said if my party wanted,

794
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:27,983
he would include anything
we wanted whether it was a clause

795
00:50:28,066 --> 00:50:30,652
on taxation or on inspection
of the budget. On top of that,

796
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:33,822
he said that he would concede
all the bills proposed by my party

797
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:35,741
that your party was opposing.

798
00:50:36,658 --> 00:50:37,659
Why?

799
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:40,162
Why would he do that?

800
00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:43,248
I came to you
because I wanted to ask you that.

801
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:48,378
Here's my guess.

802
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:49,838
I think it's because of the land.

803
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:51,548
The land?

804
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:54,843
Are you talking about the land
for the new business?

805
00:50:54,926 --> 00:50:55,969
There's no way

806
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:58,805
he would make such a demand
unless that's what he was going after.

807
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:00,849
What kind of demand did he make?

808
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:03,727
He said that he would comply
with all of our demands

809
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:05,395
under one condition.

810
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:08,023
Clause 15.

811
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:13,236
He asked to protect the clause
on the purchase of national land.

812
00:51:16,531 --> 00:51:18,116
What's so special about the land?

813
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:20,243
Did you guys bury gold in the land
or something?

814
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:22,162
If not,

815
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:26,541
why would he practically beg my party's
representative to leave that land alone?

816
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:49,564
RENEWABLE ENERGY COMPLEX

817
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:51,483
CLAUSE 15: PURCHASE OF LAND

818
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:54,486
"Clause 15. When proceeding
with the new business,

819
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:57,489
the national land in Songju

820
00:51:57,781 --> 00:52:01,868
will be purchased by the assigned company
that specializes in energy resources."

821
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:06,832
JQ will purchase the national land
for the new business.

822
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:08,875
That's what this clause means.

823
00:52:10,168 --> 00:52:13,171
Why is Mr. Hong
trying so hard to protect this land?

824
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:25,475
Hey, Ho-gyu. What's up?

825
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:26,810
Where are you, Detective Jo?

826
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:29,229
What? What is this about?

827
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:31,064
I found something.

828
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:34,276
I'll tell you what I found in person.

829
00:52:34,359 --> 00:52:35,485
It's urgent.

830
00:52:35,777 --> 00:52:38,238
-What is it about?
-Can I go to your house now?

831
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:40,323
You can't come to my house now.

832
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:42,325
Internal Affairs is surveilling the area.

833
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:45,954
Come to my neighborhood.
I'll call when I get there.

834
00:52:46,037 --> 00:52:47,622
Okay. You're on your way now, right?

835
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:49,040
Yes. I'm on my way now.

836
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:13,523
I'M AT A NEARBY CONSTRUCTION SITE

837
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:39,132
Where are you?

838
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:41,843
I'm at a nearby construction site
to avoid Internal Affairs.

839
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:45,805
Sir, please make a left turn
at the intersection up ahead.

840
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:47,057
Okay.

841
00:53:55,523 --> 00:53:57,776
Why are you here?

842
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:14,709
It wasn't you, right?

843
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:21,716
I'm getting the wrong idea, right?

844
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,433
Then were you behind...

845
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:38,400
Were you behind the hit-and-run accident?

846
00:54:40,151 --> 00:54:42,070
Were you the one who deleted
the security footage?

847
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:47,867
Why did you do it?

848
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:25,673
DETECTIVE JO TAE-SIK

849
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:48,006
Ho-gyu!

850
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:57,223
Hey.

851
00:57:57,682 --> 00:57:58,766
Hey.

852
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:00,018
Why...

853
00:58:00,685 --> 00:58:01,895
Why are you...

854
00:58:07,108 --> 00:58:08,109
Who is it?

855
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:10,278
Who did this to you?

856
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:12,822
Who is it? Who?

857
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:24,417
Hey. Hey!

858
00:58:24,792 --> 00:58:27,212
Hey! Ho-gyu!

859
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:29,923
Hey, Ho-gyu. Ho-gyu.

860
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:31,299
Ho-gyu.

861
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:32,634
Damn it.

862
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:34,636
Damn it.

863
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:39,724
Hey.

864
00:58:39,807 --> 00:58:41,768
Ho-gyu. Hey.

865
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:48,942
Hey!

866
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:56,783
Hey.

867
00:58:56,991 --> 00:58:59,327
Hey, Ho-gyu.

868
00:59:00,161 --> 00:59:01,412
Open your eyes.

869
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:04,332
Come on!

870
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:09,671
Get yourself together!

871
00:59:19,097 --> 00:59:20,557
What am I going to do?

872
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:26,563
I'm really scared.

873
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:34,445
For now, the most likely suspect

874
00:59:34,529 --> 00:59:35,905
is Lieutenant Jo Tae-Sik.

875
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:37,198
Was that your doing?

876
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:39,951
Tell him to come out and clear his name.

877
00:59:40,368 --> 00:59:43,413
Ms. Kim, let me ask you for a favor.

878
00:59:43,496 --> 00:59:46,249
Are you saying that he deliberately
put your gun on the scene?

879
00:59:46,332 --> 00:59:48,334
Ho-gyu called me that day.

880
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:49,794
He had found something

881
00:59:49,877 --> 00:59:52,088
-and had to see me urgently.
-What did he find?

882
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:53,756
Everyone on the list...

883
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:56,050
They all might be ill.

884
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:57,385
I'll take this to the end.

885
00:59:57,468 --> 00:59:59,721
Now, this has become my business.
