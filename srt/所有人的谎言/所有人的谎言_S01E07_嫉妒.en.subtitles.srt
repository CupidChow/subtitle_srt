THIS DRAMA IS A WORK OF FICTION.

00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:44,062
Sang-hun.

4
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:50,401
Sang-hun, look at me.

5
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:52,403
Are you all right?

6
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:53,905
Yeong-min.

7
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:57,617
You came. Thank you.

8
00:01:58,576 --> 00:01:59,911
Thanks, Yeong-min.

9
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:02,580
How's my father-in-law?

10
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,875
Is he okay?

11
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,127
He passed away.

12
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,964
Three days ago, in a car crash.

13
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,134
I'm coming from his funeral.

14
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:17,595
Father...

15
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,474
died in a car accident?

16
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,520
Does that make sense to you?

17
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:28,898
What the hell did they do to him?

18
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,234
Sang-hun, who did what?

19
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:32,443
Tell me.

20
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,654
What were you doing?

21
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:38,366
-What?
-What the heck were you doing

22
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:41,619
until he ended up like that?

23
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,249
I thought you'd help us.

24
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:50,336
I want to help.

25
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,091
That's why I came here.

26
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,010
Then...

27
00:02:58,469 --> 00:02:59,804
Let's get out of here.

28
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:01,598
We'll go and see the chairman.

29
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:05,351
What did you say?

30
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:06,936
Let's meet him together

31
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:08,980
and try to persuade him again.

32
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:11,649
We're practically begging him.

33
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,735
I'm sure he'll change his mind.

34
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:16,863
I suppose you're not on my side.

35
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:24,746
You're well aware of all the things
that my dad has done to me.

36
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:27,832
And what? We should persuade him?

37
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:33,254
Sang-hun, let's go.

38
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,215
Okay?

39
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:44,474
Sang-hun!

40
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:46,309
Jeong Sang-hun!

41
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:09,684
JEALOUSY

42
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:21,279
He got this in return for helping him.

43
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,240
Apparently, he just let him use his phone

44
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,117
and helped him escape
through the rear exit.

45
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:27,869
Then why did he run away?

46
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:29,579
He saw the news and got scared,

47
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,706
so he confessed everything
to his uncle, Dr. Park.

48
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,042
And Dr. Park told him
that he should lie low,

49
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,252
thinking he might take the rap
for the whole thing.

50
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,546
We thoroughly searched his motel room

51
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:40,214
but found nothing related to Jeong.

52
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:41,799
Jeez, this is nuts.

53
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:45,762
What is going on, then?
That punk isn't In Dong-gu's snitch.

54
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:50,099
So Jeong Sang-hun walked out on his own
and got abducted again or something?

55
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:52,560
I wonder why.

56
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,439
Why do you think he hid the fact
that he spoke to Jeong Sang-hun?

57
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:03,404
Sir.

58
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:07,325
TEAM LEADER OF NEW BUSINESS

59
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,952
Where did Mr. Jin go?

60
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,622
Well, I haven't been able to reach him
since the weekend.

61
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,540
He's never done this before.

62
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:53,871
Yes, the results are out.

63
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:56,124
We've found a tire that matches the marks.

65
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,724
YEONGWON CHILDREN'S HOME

66
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:16,727
What's the time, Mr. Wolf?

67
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:19,647
What's the time, Mr. Wolf?

68
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:25,653
I'm here!

69
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:32,285
We went through all our records
after receiving your call yesterday.

70
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:33,661
-I see.
-But

71
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,122
we found nothing on him, which is strange.

72
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:37,665
Pardon? What do you mean?

73
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:41,335
This is a list of all the children
we were looking after at the time.

74
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:45,423
CHILD PROFILE

75
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:47,925
Look. We found records on Jin Yeong-min,

76
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:50,052
but nothing on Yu Eun-seong.

77
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,723
Then do you remember anything about him
by any chance?

78
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:57,018
I wasn't here back then.

79
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,022
Then,

80
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:04,859
do you know if this person is still here?

81
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:06,652
Sister Choi?

82
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,863
She is still here,

83
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:10,948
but she is volunteering abroad
at the moment.

84
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,159
She'll be back in a few days.

85
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:15,912
Then please call me when she's back.

86
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:21,876
Search every nook and cranny.
We must find something.

87
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,669
Go that way.

88
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:27,882
KOREAN CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION

89
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:37,350
There's nothing.

90
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:48,236
No traces of blood.
There isn't a single strand of hair here.

91
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:51,197
Darn it. Did this bastard
clean the whole house and flee?

92
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,324
Can you find out if he used bleach?

93
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:28,985
Did you find anything?

94
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,406
-Tell them to rush it.
-Yes, sir.

95
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:36,033
So, you found nothing?

96
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,286
-Yes.
-That's right.

97
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,038
We searched the entire house.
There's nothing here.

98
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:44,959
Wait.

99
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,217
What's going on here?

100
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:58,306
We haven't been able to reach you
since yesterday. Where were you?

101
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:00,224
I was out of town for work.

102
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,811
None of your colleagues knew about it.

103
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:05,646
I don't tell them
everything on my schedule.

104
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,941
It was an emergency, so I couldn't
even find time to call the office.

105
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:12,028
And the connection was bad
because I was in a remote area.

106
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,780
I can give you their number if you'd like.

107
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,365
Call them and check.

108
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:19,410
I heard you and Mr. Jeong
have been friends for a long time.

109
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:21,329
Yes.

110
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:23,247
Then you must care about him a lot
as a friend.

111
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:26,208
I'm sure you want to find him
more than anyone else does.

112
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,045
-Right.
-Is that why

113
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,256
you went to see him?

114
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,846
RESULTS ON TIRE MARK

115
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:46,520
This is from my car.

116
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:50,816
I got a call from Sang-hun that day.

117
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,862
That was when I first found out
he had been confined there

118
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:56,530
and how he ended up there as well.

119
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,157
I see.

120
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,493
And?

121
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,994
He asked me for help.

122
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,665
He said he figured out a way
to get out and asked me

123
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:07,958
to come and get him.

124
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:10,836
Then what did you do? You just went there?

125
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,422
Fully knowing
that Chairman Jeong sent him there?

126
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,758
I was going to get him out first,

127
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,594
and then try to persuade Chairman Jeong.

128
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,472
I wanted to help Sang-hun
if he ended up there

129
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:24,183
against his will

130
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:26,852
because he's my friend.

131
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:30,064
But he didn't show up.

132
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:34,568
So, I just came back.

133
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:37,488
Nothing else happened.

134
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,240
That's a simple story.

135
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:44,161
Your friend, who asked you for help,
didn't show up, but you just came home?

136
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:47,248
Were you not worried?

137
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:52,086
I just assumed he got caught by
the hospital staff while trying to escape.

138
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:55,297
I was going to call the hospital
the next day

139
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,341
but heard he disappeared.

140
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,593
Then why haven't you told anyone
about this?

141
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:04,014
Chairman Jeong said nothing about you,
which means he had no idea either.

142
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:06,016
I didn't want any misunderstanding.

143
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,145
-"Misunderstanding"?
-The speculations

144
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,564
that you are making about me.

145
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,277
You're an interesting guy.

146
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:18,612
You were worried about him,

147
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:20,781
so you rushed there
without telling Chairman Jeong.

148
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:23,617
But you've been keeping your lips sealed
because you were afraid

149
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,244
that you'd be pegged as a suspect?

150
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:27,413
Knowing it'd cause confusion
in the investigation?

151
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:31,333
Which side of the story is true?

152
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,098
Yeong-min is a suspect?

153
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:47,558
Yes.

154
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:51,395
He was the last person Mr. Jeong spoke to
on the phone before he disappeared.

155
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:54,190
He was also the one
who went to the woods to pick him up.

156
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:57,526
Yeong-min

157
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,403
picked him up?

158
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,363
Then where did he take him?

159
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:04,783
He said Mr. Jeong didn't show up.

160
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,953
I wonder why he never told me.

161
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,832
So, what did Yeong-min say?

162
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,752
There must've been a reason.

163
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:16,212
What reason?

164
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:19,840
Will you be understanding
if he had a reason?

165
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:32,603
YEONGWON CHILDREN'S HOME

166
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:34,188
It's a photo of Sang-hun and Yeong-min.

167
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:39,568
They grew up together
at the same children's home.

168
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:41,862
Yeong-min

169
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:44,365
has probably spent more time

170
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:48,035
with Sang-hun
than even I or his father has.

171
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:51,872
And Yeong-min was the one
whom he trusted and confided in the most.

172
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,835
-Maybe that's why he called him first.
-Do you have a dog?

173
00:13:58,295 --> 00:13:59,964
-Sorry?
-If I were you,

174
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:01,632
I'd even be suspicious of my dog.

175
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:06,845
Has anyone around you
been completely truthful with you?

176
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,140
Take a good look at yourself and find out

177
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:14,562
if you really believe him
or if you just want to believe his words.

00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:58,105
The person you're trying to...

180
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,441
YEONG-MIN

181
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,575
Yeong-min, are you busy?

182
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,786
I need to talk to you about something.
Call me.

183
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:21,587
Mr. In.

184
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:27,843
Sir.

185
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:40,064
Go on.

186
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:48,739
Hey, Ho-gyu. Why don't you get it?

187
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:50,574
Are you still suspecting In Dong-gu?

188
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,368
The tire marks match Jin Yeong-min's car.

189
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,704
But we can't eliminate him
from the list of possible suspects.

190
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,748
He was at the hospital
when Sang-hun went missing.

191
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:59,500
And did you not hear what Yeong-min said?

192
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,126
He said Sang-hun didn't show up.

193
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,129
Are you religious?
What's with this unbending belief?

194
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:06,423
Look.

195
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:10,177
Captain, Jin Yeong-min is benefiting
from Chairman Jeong's help

196
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:13,430
and can earn a living,
all thanks to Jeong Sang-hun.

197
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:16,809
So, why on earth
would he dismember a friend like that?

198
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,687
I think In Dong-gu
is much more suspicious.

199
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:23,273
He couldn't stand Jeong Sang-hun
because of the new project.

200
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,818
And what else? He even took him
to the mental hospital.

201
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:28,362
What about the unregistered vehicle
he scrapped on that day?

202
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:31,532
You brat, how dare you talk back to me?

203
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:35,035
Hey, what's the story between
Jeong Sang-hun and Jin Yeong-min?

204
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,454
Kim Seo-hui was right.

205
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:40,374
They grew up together
in a children's home.

206
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:43,085
Apparently, Chairman Jeong
took in Jin Yeong-min as well

207
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:44,962
when he was adopting Jeong Sang-hun.

208
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,549
Only Jin Yeong-min was raised
by the housekeeper though.

209
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:53,303
Back in school, his nickname was
"Jeong Sang-hun's Butler."

210
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,529
I haven't seen you
at the head office in a while.

211
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:11,947
Why don't we have some tea?

212
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:20,831
Let's be honest.

213
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,208
That's what I was hoping.

214
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:27,046
I know you've been tailing me.

215
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,717
I was just following the chairman's order.

216
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,595
You went there that day
to get Mr. Jeong out, didn't you?

217
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:37,139
From what I know, I'm not the only one.

218
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,307
About Mr. Jeong...

219
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:40,893
Was it your doing?

220
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:49,026
I thought it was your doing.

221
00:17:57,701 --> 00:18:01,038
You were supposed to be
the head of the new business team.

222
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:05,709
Until your most trusted friend
stole it from you, that is.

223
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,254
And after all, he's not even
Chairman Jeong's real son.

224
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:14,009
You had devoted your entire life
to this one person.

225
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:16,053
But one day, you looked back

226
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,931
and realized that you're just a manager.

227
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:21,892
You're a mere manager after all.

228
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:26,188
I'd say, that's enough of a motive.

229
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:32,361
They went to the same schools
from grade 1 to 12 and even college.

230
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:36,907
Yes. Their major is the same too.
They were even in the same clubs.

231
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:40,119
It seems like his job was to pave
all the ways for Jeong Sang-hun

232
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,453
so that he'd have it easy.

233
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:47,751
Gosh. If you had to do this
your whole life,

234
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:49,962
you'd think it's unfair.

235
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:53,132
If it was me, there will come a time
when I'll lose it.

236
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:55,592
I'd be like, "I want to live my own life."

237
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:01,265
I'd be lying if I told you
I had never been upset.

238
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,518
But the thing is,

239
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:07,604
the human mind

240
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:11,358
consists of more than
just one kind of emotion.

241
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:17,406
Although I guess
single-minded people like you

242
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,324
who try to achieve your one goal
at all costs

243
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:23,245
wouldn't really understand.

244
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:28,667
I'd love to stay and chat,

245
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:31,086
but I'm quite busy today.

246
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:42,014
Nothing related to Mr. Jeong was found

247
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:44,099
at any of the properties
that Mr. Jin owns.

248
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,727
The police didn't find anything either.

249
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,438
What about the GPS records?

250
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,523
It matches Mr. Jin's statement.

251
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,483
We've confirmed that he was meeting

252
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:56,653
with a solar panel specialist in Cheongju
when we couldn't reach him.

253
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,865
Shall I continue to keep an eye on him?

254
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:03,285
Yes, continue to keep an eye
on both Yeong-min and Mr. In.

255
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,037
Also,

256
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,207
have someone tail Yeong-min.

257
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,628
All right. Let's go through everything
one more time.

258
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:14,338
-Write it down.
-Yes, sir.

259
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:18,467
We don't know Jeong Sang-hun's whereabouts
after he escaped Yanggye Mental Hospital

260
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:20,052
on March 6.

261
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:21,887
So let's check

262
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:24,890
Jin Yeong-min and In Dong-gu's alibis
for that day and go from there.

263
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:26,391
Okay. In Dong-gu first.

264
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,936
He said he went to the hospital
to visit Jeong Sang-hun

265
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:31,146
but couldn't see him,
so he went straight home.

266
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,899
Jin Yeong-min also said that he went home

267
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:36,193
because Jeong Sang-hun didn't show up.

268
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:38,153
But all we have are their statements.

269
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,321
Right,

270
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:42,658
so one of them must be lying.

271
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:46,161
In Dong-gu said he didn't see
Jeong Sang-hun, but he scrapped the car.

272
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:49,539
Jin Yeong-min said Jeong Sang-hun
didn't show up when he called for help.

273
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,668
But the thing is, we don't have
any evidence to help us figure out

274
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:55,587
which one of them took Jeong Sang-hun.

275
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:57,172
Then why don't we

276
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:59,633
look into the dates
when the hand and foot were found?

277
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:01,134
Right, the hand.

278
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,388
The hand was found first
at Kim Seung-cheol's memorial ceremony.

279
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:09,268
But both of them were there
when that happened,

280
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:10,560
so their alibis check out.

281
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:14,231
And we tried to track down
the express courier the culprit hired,

282
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:15,774
but our attempt failed.

283
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:18,485
So, let's revisit their alibis for the day
when the foot was found.

284
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:19,569
The foot.

285
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:21,154
As we all know,

286
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:25,575
In Dong-gu visited the factory 1.5 hours
prior to the incident. Remember?

287
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:28,912
WE WANT OUR WORKPLACE BACK

288
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:33,375
Right, he did. As for Jin Yeong-min,

289
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,544
he had to attend a seminar that afternoon.

290
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:37,379
From 4 to 9 p.m.

291
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,673
But coincidentally,

292
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:43,135
they were replacing their security cameras
that day, so there's no footage.

293
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:47,014
However, all the employees said
that he didn't leave the office.

294
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,852
I have to say,
I don't think it's Jin Yeong-min.

295
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,855
-I think it's In Dong-gu.
-In Dong-gu isn't an idiot.

296
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:56,481
He knew he'd be suspected.

297
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,608
Why would he put the foot there?

298
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:01,987
Reverse psychology. Maybe he thought
it's too obvious for him to be suspected.

299
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:04,656
Hey, there were other people
who visited the factory that day.

300
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:08,035
The juice delivery guy
and the maintenance guy. That's all.

301
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:10,412
I see. Then I'll take a look
at the security footage.

302
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:11,330
Suit yourself.

303
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:14,499
He said a juice delivery guy
and a maintenance technician

304
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,126
all came in the morning.

305
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:17,586
-In the morning?
-Yes.

306
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,922
That's not what I read in the report...

307
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:22,966
Hold on. A maintenance technician.

308
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,970
He came in the evening. Around 7 p.m.

309
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,680
-Can you check?
-Sorry?

310
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:34,895
Here it is.

311
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:39,149
"The maintenance technician
came by between 7:10 and 7:20 p.m."

312
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,610
Didn't you check this?

313
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:44,780
What's wrong? Why are you all quiet?

314
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:47,115
Well...

315
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:52,454
The janitor says he comes every month.

316
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:55,540
So you didn't even check it?

317
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:06,218
April 3, Songju RMC?

318
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:07,886
-Yes.
-This is strange.

319
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:09,805
We go there on the last day
of every month.

320
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:12,265
Can you please double-check just in case?

321
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:13,767
Please wait a minute.

322
00:23:14,684 --> 00:23:19,397
Right. We didn't send a technician
to the factory that day.

323
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:22,275
Is there a chance the record is missing?

324
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:24,194
That never happens.

325
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:26,488
Ho-gyu, that silly punk.

326
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:32,285
Are they the service technicians?

327
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:33,620
Yes, they are.

328
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,167
Ho-gyu.

329
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:40,836
Come on in.

330
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,887
REGIONAL INVESTIGATION UNIT

331
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:55,642
Hey.

332
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:57,894
Do you think this is a joke?

333
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:58,937
No.

334
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,815
Then how could you give it
a lick and a promise like that?

335
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:06,611
You're supposed to have a spot inspection
and investigate those who are involved.

336
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:09,948
-Tae-sik, he's new here, so...
-Get out.

337
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:15,954
Hey.

338
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:17,789
Do you just write down what people say?

339
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:20,000
How did it go?

340
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:23,211
They didn't send out
a technician that day.

341
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:27,215
Listen, you punk.
While you miss leads like this,

342
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,967
his family are going crazy,
waiting for him.

343
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:30,927
I'm sorry.

344
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:32,721
You stupid idiot.

345
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:36,057
You can't do your job right.
All you do is talk shit.

346
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:47,944
Hey!

347
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,405
You beat me to the punch.

348
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,783
You little punk.

349
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:57,704
What am I supposed to say
when you yell at him like that?

350
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,957
You're just covering for your man.

351
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:06,588
So what does that mean?

352
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:10,800
The criminal sneaked in as a technician
and put the foot there?

353
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:13,720
It means both In Dong-gu
and Jin Yeong-min are off.

354
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:16,640
This is driving me crazy.

355
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:19,684
We confirmed
that In Dong-gu left the building

356
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,186
before the technician came in.

357
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:25,649
But do you think Jin Yeong-min was
stuck in there for the whole five hours?

358
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:28,818
He could've at least gone
to the restroom or something.

359
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,403
Is it Ho-gyu who checked out the alibi?

360
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,405
Yes.

361
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:36,243
I should go and check it again.
There might be another mistake.

362
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:41,414
Gosh, I just got here. Darn it.

363
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:46,628
Cheers.

364
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:53,927
Did you get me
a tracking device or something?

365
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:55,971
Excuse me.

366
00:25:56,763 --> 00:26:00,267
Please bring me
a bottle of soju and a glass.

367
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,352
-Okay.
-Go sit over there.

368
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:05,146
Hey, there are no other seats.
I'm sitting here.

369
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:08,525
-Thank you.
-Please enjoy.

370
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:10,986
Don't worry.

371
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:14,531
I'm here to side with you.
Let me pour you a glass.

372
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:17,117
Gosh, it's brimming over with love.

373
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,161
Cheers.

374
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,086
Do you know

375
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:31,339
who's making me go through all this?

376
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:32,382
It's Jo Tae-sik.

377
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:36,678
He forced me to come here
when I kept saying no.

378
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:38,638
That was my first spot inspection.

379
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,557
And he didn't even teach me anything.

380
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,851
-We didn't.
-No, you didn't.

381
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:46,604
And now that we have a problem,

382
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:48,523
he's saying it's all my fault.

383
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:50,692
You're right. I understand how you feel.

384
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:54,696
If it were that important,
he should've done it himself.

385
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:59,367
All he does is let his subordinates
do all the hard work.

386
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:03,330
He only cares about going back
to his hometown. What can I say?

387
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:05,999
You're totally right about that, Ho-gyu.

388
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:09,461
I wanted to do this right.

389
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:14,007
But my pride is going out the window.

390
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:17,635
Hey, you're doing just fine.

391
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,012
Don't be like that.

392
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:25,018
The other day,

393
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:29,022
you asked me
why I quit my job at JQ Group.

394
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:31,316
Right. Why did you quit?

395
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:34,736
There are so many people
who are just too good.

396
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:40,408
And those competent people struggle
so hard to go up the ladder.

397
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:44,829
I just couldn't compete with them.

398
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,541
You know what?

399
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:52,545
One day, on my way to work,

400
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:56,424
I felt so insignificant.

401
00:27:58,551 --> 00:27:59,469
So I quit.

402
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:04,808
I thought I couldn't give up on my pride.

403
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:06,142
That's good.

404
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,269
You did the right thing.

405
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,730
But I'm being like this again here.

406
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:14,901
So is this all I'm capable of?

407
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:16,319
I can't help but feel that way.

408
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:18,696
It's just one mistake.
What's the big deal?

409
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:22,909
This is how you grow bigger
and take one step further.

410
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,787
Is it supposed to cheer me up?

411
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,665
Do you think I liked Jo Tae-sik
from the beginning?

412
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:30,583
I really hated that jerk.

413
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:34,796
Do you know what made me
open my mind to him?

414
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:38,216
What's wrong with Jin-gyeong?

415
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:40,176
What the hell is in her brain?

416
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:41,970
She has stones in her brain.

417
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:44,097
I think she has a thick head.

418
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:47,517
She's new from the country,
so she's totally out of touch.

419
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:49,102
Hey,

420
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,396
how fast can you guys run 100 meters?

421
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,023
Maybe about 15 seconds?

422
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:56,109
There's no way
you run 100 meters in 15 seconds.

423
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,861
If that's your record, mine is 13 seconds.

424
00:28:57,944 --> 00:28:58,903
That's enough.

425
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:02,198
Kang Jin-gyeong runs
100 meters in 11 seconds.

426
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:04,701
-What?
-How would a girl do that?

427
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:05,744
I'm serious.

428
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:08,204
No one in the RIU runs 100 meters
in 11 seconds.

429
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:10,373
Did you guys not know
she's a track and field athlete?

430
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:13,835
Do you remember the mugger in Gangnam?

431
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:16,838
We all missed him,
but Jin-gyeong caught up with him.

432
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:20,341
That's when she got hit by a car.

433
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:22,135
Are you siding with her?

434
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:25,346
I'm just saying we all are
good at different things.

435
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:26,639
It's not that someone is bad.

436
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:30,059
And it's true that I'm siding with her.

437
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,816
What was that all about?

438
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:38,902
Does he like her?

439
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:50,288
He rarely opens his heart to others.

440
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,958
So people often get him wrong.

441
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:57,295
And it frustrates you a lot.

442
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:03,259
About him going back to his hometown.
It's not what it looks like.

443
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:05,094
His mom is very sick.

444
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:10,350
So he's trying to wrap things up
and return to his hometown. Okay?

445
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,311
You said you're here to take my side,

446
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:16,356
but you're eventually
siding with Detective Jo.

447
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:17,899
Hey.

448
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,568
Eat this and let it slide.

449
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:22,654
Just eat it.

450
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:26,491
Excuse me.

451
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:29,828
-How may I help you?
- Hello.

452
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:34,207
Are you here to meet Mr. Jin?

453
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:38,002
He's in Seoul now.
He'll be back in the afternoon.

454
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:39,379
I see.

455
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:41,840
I'm not here to meet him though.

456
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:44,425
Can I talk with you a moment
if you don't mind?

457
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:45,635
Okay.

458
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:54,727
I answered all the questions
Chairman Jeong asked,

459
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,688
but he still seems to have big doubts.

460
00:30:57,522 --> 00:31:00,483
I think he will soon put
more tails on you.

461
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:05,113
If Mr. Jeong didn't come back

462
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:08,116
and take on the new business,

463
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:11,452
things wouldn't have
been delayed like this.

464
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,705
I had no idea

465
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:16,165
he'd oppose the project.

466
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:19,168
If we had a little more time,

467
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:22,547
I could've convinced Sang-hun.

468
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:23,756
You're right.

469
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:27,302
By the way, does Assemblywoman Kim know

470
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,054
that you're going
to the National Assembly today?

471
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:33,266
No.

472
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,731
I haven't seen you around for a while.

473
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:44,152
Stop acting like you're too busy.
I'd forget your face.

474
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,864
You should be speaking German
in your dreams by now.

475
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:49,115
What are you talking about?

476
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:50,575
Just give it a try.

477
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:54,329
If you're done traveling around Germany,

478
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,789
stop playing house with Seo-hui
and come back.

479
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:58,917
And take a job at the company.

480
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:02,420
Chairman Jeong misses you a lot.

481
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,505
He's trying to be understanding,

482
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:06,549
but it doesn't mean
he's comfortable with it.

483
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:11,179
I've made up my mind.

484
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:14,390
-About what?
-The new business.

485
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:19,479
Earlier today,

486
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:22,106
I told Dad that I'd do it.

487
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:27,445
That's good.

488
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:37,455
When you had the seminar here on April 3,

489
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:39,666
you said Jin Yeong-min
never left the office, right?

490
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:42,543
Yes. He was going to give
the presentation that day.

491
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:46,631
He stayed in the office all day except
when he went out to buy us some snacks.

492
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:48,049
-Snacks?
-Yes.

493
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:50,760
Macaroon, cake, and stuff like that.

494
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:54,013
-I already told the police.
-What time was it?

495
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:57,016
It was after dinner,
so maybe around seven?

496
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,518
Around seven?

497
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:00,937
Are you sure?

498
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:04,065
I don't know.
It's not that I saw it myself.

499
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:07,694
Mr. Im, you had
the snacks that night, right?

500
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:08,987
When we had the seminar.

501
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,280
Yes, I did. Why?

502
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:13,825
Are you sure you saw
Jin Yeong-min that night?

503
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:17,620
I don't think I did.
Right, I didn't see him.

504
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:19,163
Then what?

505
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:22,250
You said Jin Yeong-min bought
some snacks for you.

506
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,002
I just heard everyone say that.

507
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:27,380
Seung-yeon, didn't you say
that Mr. Jin got us some snacks?

508
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:30,383
Mr. Jin texted me that day.

509
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:32,427
So I thought he left some snacks.

510
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:36,514
Did anyone of you see Jin Yeong-min

511
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:38,099
when he brought the snacks?

512
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:48,234
So it means no one saw
Jin Yeong-min that night.

513
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,904
Mr. Jin Yeong-min, the head
of the new renewable energy team

514
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:54,365
of JQ Group shall take the witness stand.

515
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:57,785
KIM SEO-HUI

516
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,123
Let me ask the witness a question.

517
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:06,669
Were you the first one to propose
this new business at your company?

518
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:08,379
WITNESS STAND

519
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:10,715
-Yes.
-And before Mr. Jeong was appointed,

520
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:12,759
you were to assume the position.

521
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:16,220
And apparently,
you're currently the interim CEO.

522
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:17,388
Is that correct?

523
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:22,060
Yes, it is.

524
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:24,437
When it comes to a wind power plant,

525
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:27,732
the geographical conditions are crucial.
You know that, right?

526
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:28,941
-Yes.
-But

527
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:32,278
instead of Myeongseon or Jinpyeong
with better conditions,

528
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:35,615
why do you think Songju was selected?

529
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:37,950
-Excuse me, Assemblyman Yoon. What--
-Assemblywoman Baek.

530
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:39,077
CHAIRPERSON IM YOON-BIN

531
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:43,664
It was decided

532
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:46,250
after an in-depth discussion
of the Energy Resources Committee.

533
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:50,213
JQ Group took over
a large area of land in Songju.

534
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,882
Isn't it that they chose Songju

535
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:55,134
to make a profit from the business?

536
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:58,471
I believe the bill was suggested

537
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:01,307
to give JQ Group a special treatment.

538
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:04,185
-That's ridiculous.
-Assemblyman Yoon, why would you...

539
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:06,270
-Come on.
-What do you mean?

540
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:08,689
-That's nonsense.
-Please be silent.

541
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:10,775
It is

542
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:13,194
a special treatment.

543
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:20,201
We are selected as a company to contribute
to the future value of Korea.

544
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:22,370
-It is a special treatment.
-That's not what I mean.

545
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,955
The cities you mentioned

546
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:26,707
might have better conditions than Songju.

547
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:29,627
But let me tell you as an expert.

548
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,130
That's not true.

549
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:33,172
What?

550
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:34,549
In the energy industry,

551
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:37,718
distribution costs
more money than production.

552
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:40,012
It's all about accessibility.

553
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:43,307
The fastest route inland
and to overseas countries.

554
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:45,351
Keeping all that in mind,

555
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:47,603
do you think Songju
is the second-best option?

556
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:51,399
No. I believe it's the best choice.

557
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:54,694
JQ Group is banking on this project

558
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:56,946
tolerating the deficit
of tens of billions of won

559
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:58,573
and taking possible risks.

560
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:02,285
With only one goal
for the national competitiveness

561
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,162
of Korea.

562
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:06,122
Excuse me, Mr. Jin Yeong-min.

563
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:08,749
You can be charged with perjury
if you give false testimony here.

564
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:12,295
-What are you talking about?
-That's absurd.

565
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:14,547
Please be silent.

566
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,673
Assemblyman Yoon,

567
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:18,593
you can't press him for an answer.

568
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:20,052
Mr. Im, it's not like that.

569
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:21,888
Then why

570
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:24,473
did Mr. Jeong Sang-hun

571
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:27,185
consider relocating the site
for the new business?

572
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:31,689
Is that true?

573
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,693
I asked if it's true.

574
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:41,490
I've never heard of it.

575
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:45,661
I believe you've been given enough time.

576
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:47,163
We have other items to discuss.

577
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:49,624
About the clause 12 on the agenda,

578
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:52,710
on the special bill proposal
for the new renewable energy complex,

579
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:54,378
we will take a vote.

580
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:56,505
Mr. Im, we can't just
push it forward like this.

581
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:58,424
Let us proceed with the vote.

582
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,676
-Raise hands if you oppose the bill.
-Chairman Im.

583
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,887
Raise hands if you approve.

584
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:05,640
The bill has been approved.

585
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:14,065
Hello, sir.

586
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:15,441
It's nice to see you.

587
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:17,151
Thank you, sir.

588
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:19,695
-Have you been doing well?
-Yes.

589
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,615
YOENGWON CHILDREN'S HOME

590
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:49,809
-Do you think so?
-It could be.

591
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:53,271
But really, it is...

592
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:54,939
-What?
-What's going on?

593
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:57,608
Due to the power problem in the building,

594
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:59,944
the elevator is currently out of service.

595
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:01,988
We are trying hard to fix it
as soon as possible.

596
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:04,365
Your patience will be appreciated.

597
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,178
JIN YEONG-MIN

598
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:21,525
JQ SONGJU BRANCH

599
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:24,904
Jin Yeong-min doesn't have any meetings.
Where's he going?

600
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,282
Listen, you punk.
While you miss leads like this,

601
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,326
his family are going crazy,
waiting for him.

602
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:33,245
You can't do your job right.
All you do is talk shit.

603
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:38,292
He'll throw a fit
if I don't check this out.

604
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:39,960
Fine. Let me check this out.

605
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,338
WEEKLY SCHEDULE FOR IMPORTANT MEETINGS

606
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:44,715
He doesn't have any meetings
outside his office.

607
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:47,385
There's no reason for him
to leave the building today.

608
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:49,178
JQ SONGJU BRANCH

609
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:51,305
And that's the opposite direction
to his house.

610
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:55,184
Someone visited the factory,
pretending to be an employee there

611
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:57,645
around 7:10 p.m. to 7:20 p.m.

612
00:39:58,854 --> 00:40:00,356
As it so happens,

613
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:03,275
Jin Yeong-min doesn't have
an alibi around that time.

614
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:07,279
-Detective Jo.
-What is it?

615
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:08,948
You told me to report to you

616
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:11,450
if something seemed off about
Jin Yeong-min's movements.

617
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:30,678
Hey, he's never gone off his schedule

618
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,680
-after we installed a tracker, right?
-No.

619
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:34,765
Shouldn't he be working
at the company now?

620
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:36,183
Exactly.

621
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:39,353
I have no idea where this guy is headed.

622
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:42,022
SONGJU WASTE FACILITY

623
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:43,774
Tae-sik, turn right from here.

624
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:45,359
-From here?
-Yes.

625
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:48,654
What?
Why did he come to a place like this?

626
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:51,740
This is leading to a mountain.

627
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:53,534
Did you get any other signals?

628
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,454
What do you expect from junk like this?

629
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:58,038
We barely got his location with this.

630
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,874
Even so, try to see
if there's anything else.

631
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:01,542
-What the heck?
-What is it?

632
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:04,211
-Damn it.
-What is it?

633
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,630
The screen went off.

634
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:08,591
Damn it. Didn't you pack batteries?

635
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:09,800
Damn it.

636
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:12,052
Hey, come on.
Hitting that won't solve our problem.

637
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:13,053
Come on.

638
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,783
Damn it. It's the same road again.

639
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:36,660
Tae-sik, I'm sorry.

640
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:38,579
Can you drop me off somewhere here?

641
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:40,331
I'll go get the batteries
from the station.

642
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:43,417
Sure. Why not? I bet Jin Yeong-min
will stay here until you come back.

643
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:48,380
What is this place?

644
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:50,674
Why did they stop building
these apartments?

645
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:53,010
Why are we going in there?

646
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:56,180
He must have come to this place.

647
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:58,182
Hey, what's the smoke over there?

648
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:06,857
-Hey, come and put out the fire.
-Gosh.

649
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,068
Damn it.

650
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:28,254
"SJ".

651
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:32,007
Isn't this uniform from the facility
maintenance branch we visited yesterday?

652
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:43,394
Mr. In.

653
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:46,438
Was that you?

654
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:49,984
Did you put that box in my office?

655
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:53,571
I don't know what you're talking about.

656
00:42:57,199 --> 00:42:58,075
You don't know?

657
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:01,620
You're the only person

658
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:04,873
who would do something like that to me.

659
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,044
Did you just smile?

660
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:12,423
Do you think this is funny?

661
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:15,801
I was wondering
when you would quit pretending

662
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:18,220
to be a nice guy.

663
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:21,098
I am dying to know

664
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:24,184
what was in the box

665
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:27,396
to have made you this angry.

666
00:43:28,897 --> 00:43:31,233
You don't think I can't see
right through your little game?

667
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:33,444
You got the wrong person.

668
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:37,990
You can't eliminate me
like you got rid of Sang-hun.

669
00:43:38,907 --> 00:43:40,034
I would like to

670
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:43,162
tell you the exact same thing.

671
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:50,711
YEONGWON CHILDREN'S HOME

672
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:52,296
EUN-SEONG AND YEONG-MIN

673
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:54,298
STAY HEALTHY,
AND ALWAYS BE THERE FOR EACH OTHER

674
00:43:58,552 --> 00:44:00,054
I got rid of the record

675
00:44:00,554 --> 00:44:02,473
because the chairman asked me to.

676
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:04,683
He didn't want Eun-seong...

677
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:08,437
No. He didn't want there to be anything
that could harm Sang-hun later.

678
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:11,857
I thought about those kids

679
00:44:12,274 --> 00:44:13,984
for a very long time.

680
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:16,320
Anyway,

681
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:20,449
I sent them to him because I thought
they could have a happy life.

682
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:22,993
How could this happen to him?

683
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:25,996
Well, do you think

684
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:30,668
you can tell me about them
when they were here?

685
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:38,175
Yeong-min was abandoned at birth,

686
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:40,094
so he had grown up here since birth.

687
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:43,347
And Eun-seong was sent here
at the age of five

688
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:45,140
when his parents died in an accident.

689
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:49,770
From the first time they met,
Yeong-min liked Eun-seong very much.

690
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:53,399
As he was a few months older,
he acted like Eun-seong's big brother

691
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:55,776
and stopped other kids from bothering him.

692
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:59,822
So naturally, Eun-seong
was fond of Yeong-min, too.

693
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:01,949
When sponsors or parents

694
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:04,159
who were interested in adoption came,

695
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:07,037
they always thought
that those two were brothers.

696
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:11,959
It was so nice to see two boys
taking such good care of each other.

697
00:45:13,752 --> 00:45:15,963
Well, that changed a bit after the visit

698
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:17,965
from Chairman Jeong.

699
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:19,341
Eun-seong.

700
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,093
Eun-seong.

701
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:23,387
CHARITY EVENT

702
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:25,389
Here. It's the snack you like.

703
00:45:27,015 --> 00:45:28,392
I brought a lot.

704
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:31,395
Did you have some?

705
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:33,522
I ate a lot.

706
00:45:34,189 --> 00:45:37,109
They gave me tons.
I guess it's because it's Chuseok.

707
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:38,819
I'm so stuffed.

708
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:42,239
I know you didn't eat it.

709
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:44,450
-Here.
-I'm full.

710
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:45,659
Take it.

711
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:47,744
Didn't I tell you?

712
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:51,331
If you get sick here,
no one is here to take care of you.

713
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:53,625
Stop getting sick. Okay?

714
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:54,960
Take it.

715
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:56,503
No.

716
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:04,636
Mister!

717
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:07,931
Mister, I haven't seen you for ages!

718
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:11,143
-The boy Chairman Jeong liked at first was
-Have you been well?

719
00:46:11,768 --> 00:46:13,395
-Yeong-min.
-I played soccer at school.

720
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:16,607
He spent a lot of time with Yeong-min

721
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:18,400
and talked a lot, as well.

722
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:21,111
And I was the best
at blowing the balloons, too.

723
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:22,779
Hello, sir.

724
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:25,699
-Thank you so much for your support.
-Don't mention it.

725
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,660
Eun-seong, come here.

726
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,288
Later, I found out

727
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:34,333
that he only donated generously
to ask about Eun-seong.

728
00:46:37,836 --> 00:46:41,673
Eun-seong resembles his late son so much.

729
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:42,883
JQ CHARITY EVENT OF HAPPINESS

730
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:46,803
When it was settled
that he would adopt Eun-seong,

731
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:50,182
it was very hard on Yeong-min.

732
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:52,976
CHILD PROFILE
YU EUN-SEONG

733
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:02,861
Ma'am.

734
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:04,696
Yeong-min.

735
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:06,573
Why did he choose

736
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:08,951
Eun-seong?

737
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:12,829
Why

738
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:15,791
didn't he pick me?

739
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:21,338
Yeong-min. Oh, Yeong-min.

740
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:12,639
Mr. Jin.

741
00:48:13,682 --> 00:48:15,434
Please come with us.

742
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:20,772
You're under arrest for abduction
and battery of Jeong Sang-hun.

743
00:48:22,524 --> 00:48:25,861
You have the right to consult an attorney,
the chance to exonerate yourself,

744
00:48:25,944 --> 00:48:28,405
and file for habeas corpus
in challenging the arrest.

745
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:31,116
Are you aware of your rights?

746
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:34,578
Come with us.

747
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:44,921
YEONGWON CHILDREN'S HOME

748
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:02,814
He was the last person Mr. Jeong spoke to
on the phone before he disappeared.

749
00:49:03,398 --> 00:49:06,234
He was also the one
who went to the woods to pick him up.

750
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:08,570
Yeong-min, I feel like I'm going crazy.

751
00:49:09,988 --> 00:49:12,449
Will you tell me
once you get a call from Sang-hun?

752
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:14,117
Please.

753
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:16,203
Okay.

754
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:19,873
He already knew that Sang-hun was
at the hospital when I called him.

755
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:23,126
But he kept pretending to be clueless.

756
00:49:26,505 --> 00:49:30,133
And he was well-acquainted
with Mr. Hong, too.

757
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:33,261
Were you the first one to propose
this new business

758
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:34,554
at your company?

759
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:37,933
-Yes.
-And before Mr. Jeong was appointed,

760
00:49:38,016 --> 00:49:41,019
-He came up with the business plan,
-you were to assume the position.

761
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:43,939
-but he lost the seat to Sang-hun.
-You're currently the interim CEO.

762
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:45,315
-Is that correct?
-Yes, it is.

763
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:48,360
When my father and Sang-hun went
against the new business,

764
00:49:48,443 --> 00:49:51,697
-he must have hated that the most.
-...the national competitiveness of Korea.

765
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:55,450
PROPOSE THE BILL FOR THE NEW BUSINESS

766
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:56,993
Seo-hui, I must do it.

767
00:49:58,036 --> 00:49:59,121
Whatever that may be,

768
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:01,832
if I can save Sang-hun, I must do it.

769
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:05,544
So he must have wanted me
to propose the bill for the new business.

770
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:13,468
Did Yeong-min really do it?

771
00:50:17,305 --> 00:50:19,975
DETECTIVE JO TAE-SIK

772
00:50:21,643 --> 00:50:22,769
Yes, Detective Jo.

773
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:27,733
Okay.

774
00:50:28,233 --> 00:50:29,651
I'll head over there now.

775
00:50:41,663 --> 00:50:42,664
Detective Jo.

776
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:44,583
Smoking isn't allowed here.

777
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:49,463
Did you set up everything?

778
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:52,591
Yes. I set it up perfectly
and didn't make any mistakes this time.

779
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:57,262
And sir.

780
00:50:58,305 --> 00:51:00,599
I'm sorry about the report.

781
00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:04,269
Good job today.

782
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:17,365
Where is he?

783
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:22,996
Are you a man?

784
00:51:23,705 --> 00:51:24,831
Yes.

785
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:27,459
What is your name?

786
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:28,668
It's Jin Yeong-min.

787
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:33,006
Let's move on.

788
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:36,134
Where is

789
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:37,385
Jeong Sang-hun?

790
00:51:38,303 --> 00:51:39,179
I don't know.

791
00:51:40,013 --> 00:51:42,849
On April 3, his foot was found
at the RMC factory.

792
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:44,851
You attended a seminar at work, correct?

793
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:47,646
-Yes.
-Where were you and what were you doing

794
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:49,147
that day at 7 p.m.?

795
00:51:50,023 --> 00:51:51,983
I bought some snacks for the employees.

796
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:56,029
But no one actually saw you
around that time.

797
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:58,532
When I went to the office,
no one was inside.

798
00:51:58,615 --> 00:51:59,825
You didn't deliberately go

799
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:01,952
when it was empty?

800
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:06,832
The employees saw you again at 7:30 p.m.

801
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:09,209
It was when the seminar had resumed.

802
00:52:09,334 --> 00:52:10,627
In other words,

803
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:13,630
no one had seen you
during those 30 minutes.

804
00:52:14,339 --> 00:52:15,757
And half an hour

805
00:52:16,007 --> 00:52:18,176
is more than enough to make a round trip

806
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:20,262
from your company to the RMC factory.

807
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:23,473
Let me ask you again.

808
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:25,225
Mr. Jin,

809
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:27,060
did you leave

810
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:29,938
Jeong Sang-hun's foot at the factory?

811
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:34,693
Never.

812
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:38,280
He must have gotten ready for this.

813
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:40,866
I don't see any changes in the graph.

814
00:52:48,164 --> 00:52:49,541
What about this, then?

815
00:52:53,169 --> 00:52:54,004
What is this?

816
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:58,633
Why did you have this uniform?

817
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:03,346
It's not mine.

818
00:53:11,187 --> 00:53:13,648
Then, how can you explain your DNAs

819
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:15,233
found on this uniform?

820
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:19,279
When I went to my office,
a box was on my desk.

821
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:21,072
And the uniform was inside the box.

822
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:24,159
The secretary didn't know
who had put it in my office.

823
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:27,120
-I was only trying to see what--
-That's a lie.

824
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:31,458
That's enough.

825
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:36,755
I didn't see anyone going
into your office in the security footages

826
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:40,008
except for you, Mr. Jin.

827
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:45,347
There was a blackout today
at our building.

828
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:47,974
-I think that's when--
-Why did you burn it then?

829
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,728
Why did you have to burn it?

830
00:53:56,691 --> 00:54:00,195
The culprit dressed up as an employee
from the facility maintenance branch.

831
00:54:00,278 --> 00:54:02,405
And no one knew except for the police

832
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:03,823
and the culprit.

833
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:06,743
You knew that this would be
considered evidence,

834
00:54:06,826 --> 00:54:08,578
so you were trying to get rid of it.

835
00:54:12,123 --> 00:54:15,293
Something felt off because it came
in the same box used for Sang-hun's limbs.

836
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:19,422
Whatever was inside the box,
I thought it had to be a trap.

837
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:23,718
Can't you see?

838
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:27,347
I'm being set up right now.

839
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:32,185
Someone set this up,
so I'll be framed for this.

840
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:36,064
The real culprit who harmed Sang-hun.

841
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:46,616
Wait.

842
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:56,376
QUICK QUICK

843
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:14,310
-Give me that.
-Try it one more time.

844
00:55:16,187 --> 00:55:17,647
-Are you done?
-Yes. Almost.

845
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:19,983
I need to look this over.

846
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:21,317
Where's the entertainment team?

847
00:55:24,237 --> 00:55:25,196
The entertainment team?

848
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:26,990
Over there.

849
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:28,491
Come over here.

850
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:30,285
Hey, put this up for me.

851
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:32,203
-Check it quickly.
-Okay.

852
00:55:32,912 --> 00:55:35,081
Excuse me.

853
00:55:38,084 --> 00:55:40,545
Sir, are you waiting for a parcel?

854
00:55:40,628 --> 00:55:41,755
No.

855
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:42,881
BAREUN NEWS

856
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:46,843
Please ask him this question.

857
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:50,221
Ask him

858
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:53,224
if he had ever been jealous
of Sang-hun in his life.

859
00:55:57,395 --> 00:56:00,690
Have you never been jealous
of Jeong Sang-hun? Not even once?

860
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:03,109
No, never. Not even once.

861
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:05,862
Even when Sang-hun became

862
00:56:06,738 --> 00:56:08,531
the CEO of the new business
and you didn't?

863
00:56:09,282 --> 00:56:11,034
Even when Jeong Sang-hun stole

864
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:12,994
the CEO seat from you?

865
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:15,246
No.

866
00:56:16,414 --> 00:56:17,665
Even when

867
00:56:20,001 --> 00:56:22,670
Father chose Sang-hun as his son,
instead of you?

868
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:27,801
Then, how about
when Chairman Jeong Yeong-mun chose

869
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:31,554
Yu Eun-seong as his son?

870
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:35,767

BAREUN NEWS, ENTERTAINMENT TEAM

877
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:46,087
This is a bottle.

878
00:57:47,672 --> 00:57:48,756
Jin Yeong-min.

879
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:51,259
Do you actually

880
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:54,471
want Sang-hun to come back

881
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:56,806
alive?

882
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:06,608
Yeong-min.

883
00:58:19,787 --> 00:58:22,248
-What's wrong?
-Hey, what's going on?

884
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:23,541
Sir, it's...

885
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:24,918
-Are you all right?
-What is it?

886
00:58:29,088 --> 00:58:30,715
-What is it?
-What's inside?

CRIME DIVISION

889
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:41,851
Hey, I just got a call.

890
00:58:41,935 --> 00:58:44,604
-What's going on?
-They just got an eye.

891
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:46,981
-What?
-Speak slowly.

892
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:48,274
A newspaper agency got an eye.

893
00:58:48,983 --> 00:58:50,360
What?

894
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:52,487
I just received a call.

895
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:55,156
A newspaper agency received his eye.

896
00:58:57,075 --> 00:58:58,076
Jeong Sang-hun's eye.

897
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,081
What?

898
00:59:33,027 --> 00:59:35,905
His hand, foot, and eye this time.

899
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:38,324
Do you really think
the culprit left a message?

900
00:59:38,616 --> 00:59:41,786
The woman who jumped off
the rooftop of her apartment.

901
00:59:41,869 --> 00:59:44,372
Perhaps, she might not have
committed suicide.

902
00:59:44,455 --> 00:59:46,291
It cannot be a coincidence, sir.

903
00:59:46,374 --> 00:59:49,460
I am certain that someone
is trying to dig up that incident.

904
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:53,006
I keep thinking
that it's connected to our case.

905
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:55,758
I'm scared, too. The sides of Sang-hun
I don't know about...

906
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:58,261
Do you think
Jeong Sang-hun is still alive?

907
00:59:58,344 --> 01:00:00,263
Which side is the real you?
