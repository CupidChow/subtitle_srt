THIS DRAMA IS A WORK OF FICTION.

PROMOTION AND RECOGNITION CEREMONY

00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:49,883
You all had to overcome
the fierce competition to be here.

5
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:52,802
We welcome you

of the people of Seoul.

00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:08,359
Once again, I'd like to emphasize
the importance of being faithful

10
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:09,944
to your duty in your own positions.

11

On March 12, 2016.

15
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:26,252
Park Yeong-jin, the Commissioner-General
of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency."

16
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:33,259
About face.

17
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:35,470
Present arms.

18
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:52,946
FRAMED

19
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:55,615
Tell us if there was anything notable.

20
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:58,743
Detective Jeon was already dead
when we got here.

21
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,370
-Over here.
-And Jo Tae-sik...

22
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:03,665
-Yes.
-He was right beside him.

23
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:07,085
So we were going to arrest Jo Tae-sik,

24
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:08,795
but he hit us and ran.

25
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,046
-Captain.
-Which way?

26
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,131
Captain.

27
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,383
-Yes.
-It's over here.

28
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:16,469
-Search this area.
-Yes, sir.

29
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,764
-What about over there?
-There was nothing.

30
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:23,852
-What about the gun?
-We haven't found it yet, sir.

31
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:27,063
-Where is Detective Kim?
-He's over there.

32
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,734
-How about the area behind the site?
-Not yet.

33
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:33,653
-Search that area too.
-Yes, sir.

34
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:35,321
We'll check over there.

35
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,073
Why are you both going there?
One's enough.

36
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,032
I'll go.

37
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,242
-Go check.
-Yes, sir.

38
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:41,703
-Hey, let's go together.
-Sure!

39
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:43,246
Please check over here.

40
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:46,374
I don't think we'll find anything here.

41
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:48,293
I'll look again, just in case.

42
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:51,462
Search thoroughly.
There has to be something. Focus, guys.

43
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:52,547
Yes, sir.

44
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:55,049
-Hey, Detective Seo!
-Yes, sir!

45
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:03,474
Yes, sir.

46
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,771
Isn't that one of ours?

47
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:11,274
-Check the serial number.
-Yes, sir.

48
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:14,277
Hey, KCSI!

49
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:18,573
Check the serial number.

50
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:31,628
Next news.

51
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:34,714
Detective Jo of
Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency's

52
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:38,384
Regional Investigation Unit who was
in charge of Jeong Sang-hun's case

53
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,553
shot and killed his colleague

54
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,514
nearby his residence
earlier this evening and fled.

55
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:46,351
-The police
-That can't be.

56
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:48,519
suspect that he committed such an offense

57
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:50,688
as a retaliation
for being suspended from work

58
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:53,524
due to forging an official document.

59
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,871
This is regarding
the murder of Corporal Jeon Ho-gyu

60
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:09,290
which took place around 10 p.m. yesterday.

61
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:11,960
For now, the most likely suspect

62
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:15,797
is Lieutenant Jo Tae-Sik
of the Regional Investigation Unit.

63
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:18,591
According to Internal Affairs,

64
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,385
Corporal Jeon was already dead

65
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:23,638
when they arrived at the scene.

66
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:25,974
Based on the gun found at the scene

67
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:29,519
and the text message Corporal Jeon sent
right before the murder took place--

68
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,479
A text message? What did it say?

69
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:35,191
He wrote that he was being threatened
by Detective Jo

70
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,610
and asked them to come to where he was.

71
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:40,321
So? Do we know Jo Tae-sik's whereabouts?

72
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:43,157
It seems like he fled
in the direction of the main street

73
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:46,035
through the woods behind the scene.

74
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:50,623
We're currently trying to find out
where he went from there.

75
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:54,377
I'd like you and RIU 3 to be in charge
of the investigation team.

76
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:57,714
And all other teams should support them
as much as they can.

77
00:04:58,172 --> 00:04:59,799
Arrest him quickly,
or we'll be humiliated.

78
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:02,385
Arrest him as soon as possible.
Understood?

79
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,344
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

80
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:04,345
You're dismissed.

81
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:12,061
Will you be all right?

82
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,397
You and Jo Tae-sik were close.

83
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:17,066
We were, but I'll be all right.

84
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:21,487
We should arrest him quickly
for his own sake.

85
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:23,281
All right.

86
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:34,083
I got all the security footage
from the cameras around the main street.

87
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:35,460
What else, sir?

88
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:39,297
Monitor everyone around Tae-sik
as well as their phones.

89
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:40,590
Yes, sir.

90
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:47,930
NAME: JO TAE-SIK
DATE OF BIRTH: AUGUST 20, 1984

91
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:50,516
Where's his car?

92
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,727
This is nuts. I can't find it anywhere.

93
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:56,314
Do you know of any place
where Detective Jo might be now?

94
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:02,945
What on earth happened?

95
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:34,060
Jeon Ho-gyu.

96
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:36,854
Ho-gyu.

97
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,860
What are you doing here?

98
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,154
Hey.

99
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:54,580
What the heck are you doing here?

100
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:58,501
Get up, okay?

101
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:01,003
Ho-gyu.

102
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:02,797
Hey.

103
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:04,632
Jeon Ho-gyu...

104
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:07,510
Why the hell are you here?

105
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:18,688
Ho-gyu.

106
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,318
Did you ask for me, sir?

107
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:29,115
POLICE PUT OUT APB FOR DETECTIVE
WHO SHOT AND KILLED A COLLEAGUE

108
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:30,491
Was this your doing?

109
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,829
You stopped him at the right time.

110
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:41,461
That detective, Jo Tae-sik, doesn't know
how scary this world can be.

111
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:43,713
He doesn't know how scary people are.

112
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,632
It's been ages
since I last saw the likes of him.

113
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,051
And I must say,
it's quite amusing to watch him.

114
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:54,182
I'm intrigued to find out
how far he'll go.

115
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:56,809
But the thing is,

116
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,562
there's a right time for everything.

117
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,230
Right now,

118
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:04,525
I'm not in the mood to play with him.

119
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:06,736
That's what matters.

120
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:11,699
This will teach him
that he should stop snooping around.

121
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:14,285
But we never know,

122
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,247
so you need to take care of him perfectly.

123
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,960
I don't want to see him
making trouble around Seo-hui

124
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,296
ever again.

125
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:31,135
Do you understand?

126
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,387
Yes, sir.

127
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:40,895
Hong Min-guk is meeting
the leader of the opposition party

128
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:43,105
at a Japanese restaurant at 7 p.m.

129
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:46,150
You should call him before they meet.

130
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:52,448
I heard Mr. In had a one-on-one meeting
with Chairman Jeong.

131
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:55,117
Who could it be?

132
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,788
I don't think Detective Jo Tae-sik did it.

133
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,123
Do you think he's being framed?

134
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:02,833
Please find out more

135
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,211
about this case.

136
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,630
So what's going on with that girl?

137
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:10,007
Come on. Why are you even asking?
It's obvious.

138
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:11,551
Goodness.

139
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,219
Tae-sik, where are you?

140
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,930
Why aren't you picking up?

141
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:17,932
Are your fingers broken or what?

142
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:19,058
Tae-sik.

143
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:20,601
You're alive, right?

144
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:22,728
Hey, Jo Tae-sik.

145
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,106
Are you all right?

146
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,609
Say something, please.

147
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,152
-Shall I ask her?
-Yes, ask her.

148
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:31,779
-For real?
-Yes, do it.

149
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:40,746
Hey, Sergeant Kang.

150
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:45,209
Is it really true?
The murder case on the news.

151
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:48,170
Is it really about your previous team?

152
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,882
I guess it is true.

153
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,219
How could he do such a thing?

154
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:57,888
I can't believe he killed his teammate...

155
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:01,767
Captain.

156
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:03,394
Yes, what's up?

157
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:06,397
May I go on patrol?

158
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,566
Sure, go ahead.

159
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:15,615
All right, be safe. See you later.

160
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,580
Hey, Jin-gyeong!

161
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,042
Captain.

162
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:33,674
You haven't heard anything
from Tae-sik, have you?

163
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:35,926
No.

164
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,012
What about you?

165
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,315
Up until a week ago,
I thought that we were doing well

166
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:51,734
and that things

167
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:54,070
were going great.

168
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:58,783
Even after the team's disbandment
and Tae-sik getting suspended,

169
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:01,535
I kept thinking,

170
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:06,248
"It's okay. Things happen.

171
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:07,875
It's all right."

172
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,378
I kept telling myself that.

173
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:13,047
But now...

174
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:18,677
I mean, why...

175
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:22,098
I just can't believe it.

176
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,811
You know him better
than anybody else does.

177
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:29,271
Why on earth would Tae-sik kill Ho-gyu?

178
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:33,359
Something's gone awfully wrong.

179
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:36,612
He has no reason to kill Ho-gyu.

180
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,031
Ho-gyu

181
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,534
wrote a statement

182
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:43,953
during the internal investigation.

183
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:48,249
He wrote that Tae-sik forced him to do it.

184
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,251
That's what I heard.

185
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,545
Ho-gyu wrote that?

186
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,005
People are saying

187
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:59,385
that's probably why Tae-sik killed Ho-gyu.

188
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:03,347
But as you know,
Tae-sik is not that kind of guy.

189
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,225
So,

190
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:09,520
if you hear from him,

191
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:12,440
tell him to come out and clear his name

192
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:14,692
as soon as he can.

193
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,111
And before that,

194
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,655
make sure you call me first.

195
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:27,329
Sir, if we make concessions
to all of the three conditions,

196
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:30,166
we'll end up losing
tens of billions of won.

197
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,710
Why did you make such a decision?

198
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:35,463
Are we running a charity here or what?

199
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,923
How could you make such a compromise

200
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,675
without consulting any of us?

201
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:42,219
You should've at least gotten approval
from JQ Foundation

202
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,472
and the subsidiaries
that are investing in the business.

203
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:46,348
Excuse me.

204
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:50,352
It is my company.
Must I obtain your approval

205
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:53,856
prior to making every single decision?

206
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:58,444
Sir, you're not the sole owner of JQ.

207
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:01,947
But you and I both know
that it's not your company.

208
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:08,621
You're just the head of the foundation,
and I think I'm being more than generous

209
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:10,873
by letting you attend our board meeting.

210
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,793
You'd better not cross the line.

211
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:20,633
I think I've made myself clear
to all of you.

212
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:23,010
Do you have anything else to say?

213
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,391
Directors, when we launch the business
after the bill passes,

214
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,101
we'll get money from the government

215
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:33,854
and quickly recover from the loss.

216
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:37,107
I'll readjust the profit-sharing ratios
so that you're not affected by

217
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,276
the loss at all.

218
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:11,100
-Hello?
-It's me.

219
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:13,978
Detective Jo.

220
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:16,438
I can't talk long.

221
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,439
Would you

222
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,275
be able to come to where I am?

223
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,360
Yes, I'll meet you there. Hold on.

224
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,571
Tell me where you are.

225
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:26,198
Yes.

226
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:28,200
And...

227
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,078
I have to ask you a favor.

228
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,956
THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY
OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA

229
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:37,251
You should just call it a day.

230
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:39,128
-Pardon?
-Mr. Kang

231
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:42,840
wants to speak with me about the bill.
I have to go and meet him now.

232
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:44,091
Now?

233
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:45,467
I think he's overwhelmed because

234
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,303
the Judiciary Committee
is around the corner.

235
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,806
-Where are you headed, ma'am?
-It's okay. It's getting late.

236
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,017
Don't worry. You should just go home.

237
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,435
But still...

238
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:00,357
PRECINCT STATION

239
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:10,951
Assemblywoman Kim, what brings you here?

240
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,078
Why don't you get in?
I'll give you a ride home.

241
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:16,040
No, it's okay. I can just take the bus.

242
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:17,041
Get in, quick.

243
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,910
Assemblywoman Kim, where are we now?

244
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:54,662
Detective Jo, are you there?

245
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,041
We're here.

246
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:02,127
I came with Detective Kang.

247
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:25,985
What the hell?

248
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,278
Where have you been?

249
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,573
You don't care about those
who have been worried about you.

250
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,331
How could you ditch me
and leave me all alone like that?

251
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:43,085
With both you and Ho-gyu gone,

252
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:46,130
do you know how scared I've been?

253
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:50,259
Tae-sik.

254
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,220
Ho-gyu...

255
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:00,728
I'm sorry.

256
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,023
I'm sorry.

257
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:09,111
Ho-gyu is...

258
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:14,408
Take care.

259
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:24,543
That arrogant prick.

260
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:26,920
He has no right.

261
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:30,257
He doesn't even do anything,
yet he's so greedy.

262
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:33,343
Please don't mind them, sir.

263
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:36,972
The directors are reacting like that
because they don't know

264
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,224
why JQ has to purchase the national land.

265
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:44,146
From now on, I'll handle
the board members' complaints

266
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,731
and just keep you updated, sir.

267
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,358
Dealing with the police
is keeping you busy enough

268
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:50,819
at the moment.

269
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:55,491
It's all because of those morons.

270
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,244
Both you and Mr. In have
so much work to do because of them.

271
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:01,163
No, sir.

272
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:02,831
It's my job.

273
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,084
Please don't worry.

274
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:08,420
All they have to do is
just sit back and keep quiet.

275
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,097
Now, tell us.

276
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,391
What the hell is happening?

277
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:25,145
I have no idea either.

278
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,400
When I got there, Ho-gyu was already...

279
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:38,075
Ho-gyu!

280
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:45,707
Hey.

281
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,587
Who is it? Who did this to you?

282
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:52,714
Who is it? Who?

283
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,759
Hey. Hey!

284
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,470
Hey! Ho-gyu!

285
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:00,222
Hey, Ho-gyu.

286
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,266
Ho-gyu.

287
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,441
Hey, Ho-gyu.

288
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:14,528
Ho-gyu. Get yourself together!

289
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:15,654
Detective Jo Tae-sik!

290
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,781
-Here--
-Hands up.

291
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:19,366
And get up slowly.

292
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:22,119
-What are you guys doing?
-I'll repeat.

293
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:23,662
Put your hands up and get up slowly.

294
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,290
-What the hell are you doing?
-It's an order!

295
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:28,584
Hands up, and get up at once.

296
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,296
-This is--
-Hands up!

297
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:36,717
You got the wrong idea.

298
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:55,319
Someone called Internal Affairs
to the scene right at that time.

299
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:58,530
That way, they can get me arrested
without a hitch.

300
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:01,909
What about your gun?

301
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:06,246
Why didn't you return it on time?

302
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:09,833
Things got out of hand
because of that gun.

303
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:11,877
What do you mean? What gun?

304
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:17,466
I returned mine
after the disciplinary hearing...

305
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:21,261
What?

306
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:26,683
Then,

307
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:32,022
Are you saying that someone deliberately
placed your gun at the scene?

308
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,818
Someone tampered with the scene?

309
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,863
At the moment,
that is the only plausible explanation.

310
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,033
Everything was set up from the start.

311
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,077
But why?

312
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,455
Why would anyone go to such lengths?

313
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,375
To stop us.

314
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,419
Ho-gyu called me that day.

315
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:57,714
He had found something
and had to see me urgently.

316
00:20:58,465 --> 00:20:59,716
What did he find?

317
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:02,010
What was it?

318
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:03,845
I don't know.

319
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,183
Ho-gyu

320
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,479
must've found something

321
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:14,898
on your laptop.

322
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:19,861
I took

323
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,322
your broken laptop

324
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:24,908
to his place

325
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:27,953
and asked him to fix it,

326
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,665
saying we should do something

327
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:33,917
to help Tae-sik

328
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:36,336
return to work.

329
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,006
I said that to him.

330
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:48,598
Had I not gone to his place that day,

331
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,143
he wouldn't have...

332
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:54,396
It's my fault
that Ho-gyu ended up like that.

333
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,274
Hey.

334
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:01,862
He died because of me.

335
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:07,701
Why is it your fault?

336
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,246
What do I do now?

337
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:15,083
It might be uncomfortable to stay here.

338
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:18,545
I'm not in a position to be picky.

339
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:21,256
I'm fine.

340
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:24,885
Please just comfort her on your way back.

341
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:28,638
Okay. I should leave now.

342
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:40,108
I'm sorry.

343
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:43,779
That you're going through all this.

344
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:46,573
Are you the criminal?

345
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:48,950
What?

346
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:55,123
It's the criminal
who should be sorry, not you.

347
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,628
I once felt the same way.

348
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:02,422
I was really upset and frustrated.

349
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:07,636
I feel really bad for Ho-gyu.

350
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:12,808
But if I quit just like this

351
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:16,228
and just give up without solving anything,

352
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:20,440
it will make Ho-gyu's death

353
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,860
come to nothing.

354
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,406
I'll take this to the end.

355
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:31,284
Now, this has

356
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:33,912
become my business.

357
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,252
SEOUL POLICE AGENCY

358
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:47,259
ARMORY, RESTRICTED AREA

359
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,014
Come here.

360
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:56,393
You really came here.

361
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:59,521
I told you not to step foot in here
for the time being.

362
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,606
Hey, you, of all people,

363
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,567
can't be in here now.

364
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:05,193
Because of your team,

365
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,237
the Seoul Police Agency
is in utter chaos now.

366
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,322
I just don't understand the whole thing.

367
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:12,409
What's so hard to understand?

368
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:13,702
Tae-sik...

369
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:17,122
Detective Jo Tae-sik
handed in all his guns.

370
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:19,708
The day he was suspended,
he came right here

371
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:22,210
and returned all his guns.
That's what he said.

372
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:23,170
Did you meet him?

373
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:25,589
Are you crazy?

374
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:27,841
How would I meet him?
I heard it before it happened.

375
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:29,801
You're so naive.

376
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:31,678
Do you trust him?

377
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:33,471
Who handed in what?

378
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:35,891
Jo Tae-sik didn't return his guns.

379
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,350
You sounded so convinced

380
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:39,144
that I just checked it again.

381
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:42,272
There's no record
in the management ledger.

382
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:44,149
It only says that he took them out.

383
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:47,360
Hey, are you serious?

384
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:49,905
Yes, I am. Are you done now?

385
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,198
You should go now.

386
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:53,742
-What if someone sees--
-What about the security cameras?

387
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:56,036
There are security cameras in there.

388
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:59,122
If he returned them, it must've been
recorded on the cameras.

389
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:00,874
If he didn't,
he wouldn't be in the footage.

390
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:02,792
Let me just check it.

391
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:04,836
If he's not in the footage,

392
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:07,589
I will never ask you
a favor like this again.

393
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:09,090
Hey.

394
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:13,553
About the security cameras...

395
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,892
This is why I told you not to come.

396
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:21,853
Actually that's why
things are so tense in here.

397
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:22,812
What do you mean?

398
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:27,525
All the security camera footage is gone.

399
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:30,862
There's no footage recorded
around that day.

400
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:38,411
I guess he tussled with someone a lot
before he died.

401
00:25:39,537 --> 00:25:42,415
He got beaten up all over his body.

402
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:45,377
Darn it.

403
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:49,089
Whoever killed him shouldn't have at least
beaten him up.

404
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:52,217
Why would they hit him so hard
when they were going to kill him?

405
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:55,011
-I heard Detective Jo is a suspect.
-He can't be.

406
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:58,974
He's falsely accused.

407
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,059
You know him.

408
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:02,978
He's not the sort of person
who'd kill someone.

409
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:05,897
Detective Kang, I'm an autopsy doctor.

410
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:09,818
An autopsy doctor
only judges evidence from a body.

411
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:13,697
And I can't find anything from the body.

412
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:15,907
Not even the DNA of a suspect.

413
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:20,370
So I can't be sure
that Detective Jo isn't a suspect.

414
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:21,663
My gosh.

415
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:27,168
Doctor, is there anything else
you found out?

416
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:31,548
Is there any evidence
to prove that Tae-sik isn't the suspect?

417
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:38,221
-What is this?
-It's from the victim's nails.

418
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:43,268
-I don't see anything.
-It's a piece of fiber.

419
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:48,523
I'm not sure
if it's from clothes or shoes.

420
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:52,152
But this is all I could find
about the suspect.

421
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:55,739
Doctor, does that mean
we can catch the criminal with this?

422
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:56,948
Not a chance.

423
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:59,492
There's no sample to compare.

424
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:02,454
-A sample to compare?
-Yes.

425
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:15,175
About the accident. The hit-and-run
accident of Assemblywoman Kim.

426
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:17,802
The security cameras in the vicinity

427
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:21,181
were off at the moment of the accident.

428
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,433
Right at the moment of the accident.

429
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,935
-It's very strange.
-What if

430
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:29,064
someone deliberately deleted the footage?

431
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:30,899
Someone inside the police.

432
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:34,194
Right after it happened,
the investigation team came down

433
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:37,238
to check the management ledger
and the footage.

434
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:40,283
But the footage was all gone.

435
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:43,078
It has never happened before.

436
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:45,455
It is a little strange.

437
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:49,042
There's someone

438
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:51,836
inside the police?

439
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:04,682
I'm going to have dinner.
Make sure this place is well guarded.

440
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:07,644
-You can go to eat dinner in 30 minutes.
-Yes, sir.

441
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:17,654
What brings you all the way here?

442
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:22,158
I know you've been working hard.

443
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:24,369
But I didn't come to see you even once.

444
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:28,373
And I didn't even thank you properly.

445
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:37,549
Here. I opened an account in your name.

446
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:40,927
Once the bill is approved

447
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,012
and the project goes ahead,

448
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,598
you will have a lot more work to do.

449
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:47,809
Use it at your own discretion.

450
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:53,982
In a situation like now,

451
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:58,361
you even have the time
to take care of things like this.

452
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:02,949
I just don't understand it, Father.

453
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:05,410
What?

454
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:07,412
I've always thought

455
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:10,749
we were feeling the same way
about Sang-hun.

456
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:15,628
But now, you don't seem
to care about Sang-hun at all.

457
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:18,089
Seo-hui, how could you

458
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,300
say such a thing?

459
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:23,470
I thought about
when you started to change like this.

460
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:27,182
That's when Sang-hun's eye was
delivered to Bareun News.

461
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:30,268
I will ask you outright.

462
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:32,937
Stopping the investigation of Choe's case

463
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:35,148
and changing the investigation team.

464
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,066
Was that your doing?

465
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:41,029
Why did you do that?

466
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:45,575
What is it Choe Su-hyeon tried to do?
Why are you doing all this?

467
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,913
He said he'd be back in 30 minutes.

468
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,414
Are you right here?

469
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:54,167
Wait there.

470
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:13,812
I've run a business for a long time.

471
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:19,192
I can't say I've led
a flawless life the whole time.

472
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:24,989
But I at least didn't do
anything to be ashamed of.

473
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,991
I just needed

474
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:31,371
an investigation team who can focus
on Sang-hun's case.

475
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:34,499
There's no other reason.

476
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,626
Choe Su-hyeon clearly

477
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:39,963
had something to do with Sang-hun.

478
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:42,048
That's what I believe.

479
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:47,929
Apparently, you've been
influenced by Detective Jo.

480
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:54,102
So do you trust the cop
who killed his colleague

481
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,854
even more than me?

482
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,273
Detective Jo didn't do it.

483
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:00,066
Then why do you think he ran away?

484
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:02,610
They have definite evidence.

485
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:05,405
You can't tell what he's like
just by looking at him.

486
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:10,076
It's a good thing
that you trust people easily.

487
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:14,330
But you also need to be careful

488
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:16,332
with the people around you.

489
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:19,419
Then do you

490
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:23,506
really trust

491
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:26,801
Mr. In and Yeong-min?

492
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:30,889
Keeping someone close
because you need them

493
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:34,183
and keeping someone close because
you trust them are different things.

494
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:38,730
You're the only person I've ever trusted.

495
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:43,610
That's why I'm worried about you.

496
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,974
What on earth did he see?

497
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:21,981
THERE IS NO PAPER FOR PRINTING

498
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,113
Where did he go?

499
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,788
Damn it. He just took off
without changing the shifts?

500
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:38,915
That stupid jerk.

501
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:50,426
Damn it.

502
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:11,883
Hey.

503
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,679
I heard others often benefit
from their colleagues' help.

504
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:19,057
But what's wrong with my colleague?
She just drags me down.

505
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:21,267
Did you bring it?

506
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:25,772
Hey, let go of it.

507
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:26,939
Hands off.

508
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,026
Are you kidding me now?

509
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:31,944
Why did you bring something I can't see?

510
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:34,280
I didn't bring this to show you.

511
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:36,115
I just took it for my sake.

512
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,992
Let me make it clear, okay?

513
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,828
-All right.
-So you're saying

514
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:43,581
there's someone else
who shot your colleague that day.

515
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,166
-Not Detective Jo.
-Right.

516
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:47,376
So he switched the guns,

517
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,378
deleted the security camera footage,

518
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:52,006
and put the whole blame on your senior?

519
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:53,800
My gosh.

520
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:58,262
And it has to be one of the cops
who had a gun on the day of the murder.

521
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,766
Hey. Seriously, you'll be in big trouble
if you keep doing this.

522
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,435
You can't suspect an innocent person

523
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:06,896
-only with suspicion--
-Can't I suspect an innocent person?

524
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:08,731
Another innocent person just died.

525
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:12,860
It's not like I'm doing this
with great expectations.

526
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,321
If I don't do this,

527
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:17,448
I feel like I'll just go insane.

528
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:20,243
Just do me a favor.

529
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:24,372
So when was it again?

530
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:26,040
The 8th.

531
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:28,793
Gosh.

532
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:31,629
Gosh, don't be silly.

533
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:34,340
Say it.

534
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:35,758
Kim Pil-hun.

535
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:39,971
He checked out a gun on April 27.

536
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:41,347
He hasn't returned it yet.

537
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:42,473
Park Jin-su.

538
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,642
He checked it out on April 15.

539
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:47,770
Oh, no. He returned it already.

540
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:49,188
So it's not him.

541
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:51,941
And...

542
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,985
There's Yu Dae-yong.

543
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:57,530
He checked out a gun when he went to
Songju and hasn't returned it yet.

544
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:00,950
Hey.

545
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:03,870
Gosh.

546
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:06,497
YU DAE-YONG
JO TAE-SIK

547
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,961
What?

548
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:16,507
Do you belatedly have
a guilty conscience or what?

549
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,426
Are you crazy?

550
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:20,928
Now even Tae-sik?

551
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:23,431
You already finished one.

552
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:25,474
Getting rid of one more

553
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:27,768
won't make much difference.

554
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,021
How much...

555
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:32,648
How much more do you want me to do?

556
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:36,360
You already did this to Ho-gyu.
Isn't that enough for you?

557
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:39,864
How long are you going to drag me around?

558
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,741
Mr. Yu.

559
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,912
You seem to believe
that your life is stuck

560
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:48,414
in a mire because of me.

561
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:50,333
But think about it.

562
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,919
We met in the mire

563
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:55,713
in the first place.

564
00:36:57,757 --> 00:36:59,717
It's been ten years already, right?

565
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:06,474
You threw yourself

566
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:08,726
into the mire.

567
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:12,521
And that's why I chose you.

568
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,776
Now you're whining that you can't do this,

569
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:18,611
but I know

570
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:22,031
you will do it when the time comes.

571
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:26,452
Since you started it,

572
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:29,914
you must end it yourself.

573
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:34,001
Before the whole world finds out

574
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:37,255
what kind of person you really are.

575
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,053
Jo Tae-sik is the last one.

576
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,640
I promise.

577
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:50,851
After that,

578
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:52,645
you and I will never

579
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:54,939
see each other again.

580
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:31,350
This means
Ho-gyu also got his hands on the list.

581
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:33,936
Who the heck are these people?

582
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:00,546
Captain.

583
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,175
How did you find me here?

584
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:06,010
Hey, Ho-gyu.

585
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:08,304
Tae-sik called me.

586
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:10,139
He said he would be late

587
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:11,932
and asked me to come here instead.

588
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:14,518
Do you have

589
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:18,814
the flash drive from Ms. Kim's laptop?

590
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:22,109
Give me that. I'll give it to him.

591
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:25,446
You will?

592
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:34,538
Ho-gyu.

593
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:38,542
When our team got disbanded like that,

594
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:41,712
I didn't feel good about it.

595
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:45,883
When I saw how you guys
didn't give up and kept trying,

596
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:47,259
I felt even worse.

597
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:48,969
I am here

598
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:51,013
to help you guys.

599
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:54,975
So just hand me over the flash drive.

600
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,394
I'll give it to him.

601
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:01,273
Wait.

602
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:05,444
How did you know
that I had the flash drive?

603
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:10,991
I didn't tell Detective Jo
that I had the flash drive.

604
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:14,412
Captain.

605
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:19,875
You're not here
because Detective Jo called you, right?

606
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:27,550
Was it you?

607
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:32,012
Were you the one
who hacked Ms. Kim's laptop

608
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:34,056
and deleted the security footage?

609
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,516
You were behind all that?

610
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:36,767
Hey, Ho-gyu.

611
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:41,355
It was you.

612
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:45,484
It was odd the security cameras
didn't work only around that time.

613
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:48,487
I doubt the hit-and-run driver had
enough time to destroy the evidence

614
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:49,655
before vanishing.

615
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:52,658
"The security camera footage
in the vicinity has been checked,

616
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:56,245
but nothing was recorded
due to the mechanical defect."

617
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:59,248
It was Captain Yu who closed this case?

618
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:08,132
You covered up Choe Su-hyeon's case
a long time ago just like this.

619
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:11,260
Hey, you're mistaken about that.

620
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:12,553
Then, tell me.

621
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:15,556
Didn't you delete the footage

622
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,268
and cover up Choe Su-hyeon's case
as a suicide?

623
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:24,773
Why did you do it?

624
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:28,068
Captain.

625
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:32,865
I thought we were a team.

626
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:34,825
Why did you do it? Why?

627
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:36,368
Hey, Ho-gyu.

628
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:40,539
In life,

629
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:43,542
some things happen
regardless of your intentions.

630
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:46,712
Now is one of those moments.

631
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,965
Just give me the flash drive quietly.

632
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:52,384
I'll explain everything later.

633
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:54,553
No. This isn't right.

634
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:56,889
Captain, I'm sorry.

635
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,349
Hey.

636
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:29,588
Let go.

637
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:33,717
-Wait.
-Hey. Let go.

638
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:41,934
Let go!

639
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:09,753
Ho-gyu! Damn it.

640
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:13,340
DETECTIVE JO TAE-SIK

641
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:44,830
Damn it.

642
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:46,165
You bastard.

643
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:47,750
You bastard!

644
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:53,130
You bastard.

645
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,466
You bastard.

646
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:01,221
Damn it.

647
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:08,896
Jerk. You jerk.

648
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:10,522
Jerk.

649
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:14,276
How could...

650
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:16,570
How...

651
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:18,113
Captain.

652
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:19,865
I'm really scared.

653
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:23,827
Please don't leave me.

654
00:44:37,257 --> 00:44:38,258
Damn it.

655
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:08,622
Ho-gyu!

656
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:14,086
Hey.

657
00:45:14,711 --> 00:45:15,838
Who did this to you?

658
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:23,137
Why...

659
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:25,389
Why...

660
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:28,725
Why!

661
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:30,519
Since you started it,

662
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:33,564
you must end it yourself.

663
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:35,732
Before the whole world finds out

664
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:37,943
what kind of person you really are.

665
00:45:38,026 --> 00:45:39,027
Why...

666
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:02,718
It is as you expected, sir.

667
00:46:03,802 --> 00:46:05,971
The two of them plotted it

668
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:09,475
and framed Detective Jo Tae-sik
for the crime.

669
00:46:12,644 --> 00:46:15,439
Will you not take any action?

670
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:19,067
It seems to me

671
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:21,445
they did a nice job
of cleaning up the mess.

672
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:25,866
By any chance, if Detective Jo Tae-sik

673
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:29,203
does end up
taking the fall for the murder...

674
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:31,413
What would you do
if you were in his shoes?

675
00:46:31,997 --> 00:46:33,248
I'm not sure.

676
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:36,668
I wouldn't want to just sit by
and be framed for something I didn't do.

677
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:39,838
I think I would hire an expensive lawyer.

678
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:42,216
Judging from his personality, I doubt

679
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:44,343
he would hire an expensive lawyer
to clear his name.

680
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:47,304
And I'm certain

681
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:49,848
that he would never stay quietly
in hiding and be on the run.

682
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:53,685
Keep a close eye on Seo-hui.

683
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:56,021
I can assure you

684
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:58,440
that those two will meet pretty soon.

685
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:00,275
GO YEON-U, GU JIN-JU

686
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:04,321
LEE SEO-YEON, LEE HA-EUN

687
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,116
Yes, this is the file I saw.

688
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:11,203
The file was
in Choe Su-hyeon's flash drive.

689
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:13,163
The list is longer than I expected.

690
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:14,957
There are more than 100 names.

691
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,000
Then, is this the list

692
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:19,795
-the late detective saw?
-Probably.

693
00:47:20,837 --> 00:47:22,422
It makes me wonder what this list means.

694
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:25,467
Whatever it is, they were willing
to kill people to keep it hidden.

695
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:29,012
They caused a car accident
to take it away from you.

696
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:31,974
And seeing how they killed people
to keep this a secret,

697
00:47:32,057 --> 00:47:35,394
I thought there must be
something hidden in this list.

698
00:47:38,063 --> 00:47:39,439
Perhaps, this could mean...

699
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:42,276
What is it? Do you have a hunch?

700
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:45,404
Something is just bothering me.

701
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:49,241
Remember the families
we visited the other day?

702
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:50,450
They were on the list.

703
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:52,202
-Go Yeon-u and Gu Jin-ju.
-Yes.

704
00:47:52,786 --> 00:47:55,205
Go Yeon-u had lung cancer.

705
00:47:56,623 --> 00:47:59,293
And that girl, Gu Jin-ju,
has a hematologic malignancy.

706
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:03,255
-Yes.
-And when we visited this town,

707
00:48:04,506 --> 00:48:07,050
there were a lot of shamanic rituals.
Remember?

708
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:09,845
-Yes.
-That's bothering me.

709
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:12,723
GO YEON-U, GU JIN-JU,
GI HAN-YEONG, KIM YUN-JU

710
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:16,310
I wonder if everyone on the list...

711
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:20,564
They all might be ill.
Is that what you're saying?

712
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:40,584
There were three people
who could have fired the gun that day.

713
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:43,045
KIM PIL-HUN

714
00:48:43,128 --> 00:48:45,297
Kim Pil-hun was in Gangnam

715
00:48:45,547 --> 00:48:47,090
at 9:14 p.m.

716
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:48,342
He's not the one.

717
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:54,598
At 9:34 p.m., Choe Hyeon-u

718
00:48:55,974 --> 00:48:57,184
was at the Police Agency.

719
00:48:57,809 --> 00:48:59,686
He stayed there throughout the night.

720
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:04,524
YU DAE-YONG

721
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:07,569
At 9:24 p.m., he was

722
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:11,573
in Bakmo-dong, Jongno-gu.

723
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:13,075
345-12, BAKMO-DONG, JONGNO-GU, SEOUL

724
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:19,247
Captain was really at the scene.

725
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:29,800
GO YEON-U, GU JIN-JU,
GI HAN-YEONG, KIM YUN-JU

726
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:37,516
SONGJU, HUI-DONG

727
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:39,643
YEONGIL-MYEON, BUHEUNG-MYEON

728
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:43,730
Here's my guess.

729
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:46,066
I think it's because of the land.

730
00:49:46,566 --> 00:49:48,944
Are you talking about the land
for the new business?

731
00:49:49,027 --> 00:49:49,986
There's no way

732
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:52,781
he would make such a demand
unless that's what he was going after.

733
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:54,866
What kind of demand did he make?

734
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:57,661
He said that he would comply
with all of our demands

735
00:49:57,744 --> 00:49:59,413
under one condition.

736
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:02,040
Article 15.

737
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:07,045
He asked to protect the article
on the purchase of national land.

738
00:50:10,215 --> 00:50:12,300
He doesn't want the other party
to go after the article

739
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:13,719
on the purchase of national land.

740
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:17,889
"Purchase of national land."

741
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:21,476
"National land..."

742
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:26,898
BUHEUNG-MYEON, HAGYE-MYEON,
YEONGIL-MYEON

743
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:28,859
All of them reside in...

744
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:35,532
ASSEMBLYWOMAN, KIM SEO-HUI

745
00:50:39,494 --> 00:50:40,579
...Yeongil-myeon,

746
00:50:41,621 --> 00:50:42,831
Buheung-myeon,

747
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:45,083
and Hagye-myeon.

748
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:52,549
So let's say that everyone
on this list is ill.

749
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:59,514
What do they have to do
with the new business?

750
00:51:07,981 --> 00:51:11,151
She asked how long we'd been living here

751
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:13,445
and when my son had become ill.

752
00:51:15,363 --> 00:51:16,406
Location.

753
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:22,871
Are the locations
of the patients relevant

754
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:24,623
to the new business?

755
00:51:29,544 --> 00:51:31,797
Damn it. Why did you come here
at such a late hour?

756
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:32,923
Tae-sik.

757
00:51:43,558 --> 00:51:44,726
Dae-yong.

758
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:54,402
He stood in our way
of reinvestigating Choe Su-hyeon's case.

759
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:57,948
-Who is it?
-And he killed Ho-gyu.

760
00:51:58,031 --> 00:51:59,074
Who did this to you?

761
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:02,869
No. He forced me to take
Kim Seung-cheol's case

762
00:52:03,328 --> 00:52:05,747
because I was going to leave soon.

763
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:07,624
That was why.

764
00:52:07,707 --> 00:52:09,960
He didn't want me to find out anything.

765
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:12,170
It was Captain.

766
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:15,549
I checked that he made a call
around the scene that night

767
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:17,676
and that a gun was in his possession.

768
00:52:18,009 --> 00:52:19,678
I checked everything.

769
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:22,764
It was our Captain

770
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:25,475
who killed Ho-gyu in cold blood.

771
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:38,905
YEONGIL-MYEON, BUHEUNG-MYEON
HAGYE-MYEON

772
00:52:39,447 --> 00:52:41,074
SONGJU

773
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:44,619
It really is true.

774
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:46,496
YEONGIL-MYEON, SONGJU RMC

775
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,123
These sick people

776
00:52:49,207 --> 00:52:51,001
are really living

777
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:54,337
on the land
where the new business will be set up.

778
00:52:55,297 --> 00:52:57,716
LAND RESERVED
FOR NEW RENEWABLE ENERGY BUSINESS

779
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:02,220
2ND RESERVED LOT: HUI-DONG
1ST RESERVED LOT: BUHEUNG-MYEON

780
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:06,725
Soon,

781
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:09,436
it will be mine.

782
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:15,317
It will happen soon enough.

783
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:26,745
Dae-yong.

784
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:42,677
Why did you do it?

785
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:45,639
Ho-gyu.

786
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:48,558
Why did you kill him?

787
00:54:03,198 --> 00:54:04,783
We have a problem.

788
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:07,661
Then, we only have one option.

789
00:54:09,454 --> 00:54:12,332
We must make a suspect
who will be framed for your act.

790
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:16,503
Put Jo Tae-sik's gun at the scene.

791
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:18,046
What?

792
00:54:20,298 --> 00:54:21,716
Switch my gun with Tae-sik's?

793
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:25,470
Shut up, and just do what I say
unless you want to be arrested for murder.

794
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:28,056
I'll clean this up.

795
00:54:28,139 --> 00:54:29,432
Just do what I say.

796
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:42,946
ARMORY, RESTRICTED AREA

797
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:46,574
UNLOCKED

798
00:55:01,172 --> 00:55:03,425
RECORD OF WEAPON AND AMMUNITION

00:55:10,765 --> 00:55:12,976
GUN, JO TAE-SIK, 3.8 PISTOL

800
00:55:38,084 --> 00:55:38,918
3.8 PISTOL

801
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:43,214
3.8 PISTOL

802
00:56:15,288 --> 00:56:16,664
Hey, Detective Seo!

803
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:17,665
Yes, sir!

804
00:56:20,293 --> 00:56:21,294
Yes, sir.

805
00:56:26,007 --> 00:56:27,842
Isn't that one of ours?

806
00:56:28,093 --> 00:56:29,511
Check the serial number.

807
00:56:29,594 --> 00:56:30,595
Yes, sir.

808
00:56:30,845 --> 00:56:33,264
Hey, KCSI!

809
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:40,480
I know you were at the scene
when Ho-gyu died.

810
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:42,982
I also know that the record
of my gun is gone.

811
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:45,902
Was it you

812
00:56:45,985 --> 00:56:48,613
who killed Ho-gyu
and framed me for the murder?

813
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:51,699
Me?

814
00:56:53,034 --> 00:56:54,369
You didn't do it?

815
00:56:56,371 --> 00:56:57,580
Tae-sik.

816
00:56:58,331 --> 00:57:00,333
I understand that people make mistakes.

817
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:04,337
I understand that you acted
in the heat of the moment.

818
00:57:05,463 --> 00:57:06,589
But,

819
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:10,135
you've gone too far.

820
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:13,763
Now, you can't undo this.

821
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:16,432
Turn yourself in.

822
00:57:17,225 --> 00:57:18,685
What on earth are you talking about?

823
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:20,186
Turn yourself in.

824
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:21,896
Dae-yong.

825
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:49,716
The secret is in this land.

826
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:50,633
SONGJU DAILY

827
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:54,012
The secret JQ is desperately
trying to hide.

828
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:56,764
If Dae-yong has been working
for JQ all this time,

829
00:57:56,848 --> 00:57:58,892
there should be
some kind of a call record.

830
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:01,144
Find out whom he was talking to
on the phone

831
00:58:01,227 --> 00:58:02,645
when Ho-gyo died.

832
00:58:04,939 --> 00:58:08,276
These people are getting financial support
from here. Please tell me why.

833
00:58:08,359 --> 00:58:11,029
I need the medical records
of the patients on this list.

834
00:58:11,112 --> 00:58:12,864
The patient conspired with a hospital.

835
00:58:12,947 --> 00:58:16,493
If this hospital doesn't cooperate,
it may look suspicious.

836
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:19,871
I worked so hard to get this.
I even broke the law.

837
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:23,500
It was because he found out
the real agenda of the new business.

838
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:25,001
They were trying to tell the public.

839
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:26,711
I dispatched my officers to find him.

840
00:58:27,378 --> 00:58:28,588
Just be patient.

841
00:58:29,964 --> 00:58:31,049
Let's hurry.

842
00:58:31,216 --> 00:58:33,009
I clearly told you

843
00:58:33,092 --> 00:58:35,970
that I will put an end to everything
if you just handle Jo Tae-sik.

844
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:38,681
Who's giving you orders?

845
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:41,267
Who the hell is behind you?
Why are you going this far?

846
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:43,937
You don't know

847
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:46,189
how frightening they can be.
