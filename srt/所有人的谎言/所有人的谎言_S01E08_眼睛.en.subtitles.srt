00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:42,167
THIS DRAMA IS A WORK OF FICTION.
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,

2
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,961
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGIONS, AND INCIDENTS
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:51,426
Hello.

4
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:55,346
I'm Mun Jeong-beom, Commissioner General
of Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency.

5
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,099
I will now share
the course of police investigation

6
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:00,185
regarding the CEO of JQ Group,

7
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:02,645
Jeong Sang-hun's disappearance
and battery step by step.

8
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,649
On March 7, we have discovered

9
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:10,361
Jeong Sang-hun's first severed body part.

10
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,822
Considering the gravity of the case,

11
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:14,699
immediately after the incident,

12
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,119
we have set up
the Investigation Headquarters in Songju

13
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,664
where the incident took place
by putting Seoul RIU in charge.

14
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:27,087
The culprit has become more clever
about his mode of operation day by day

15
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,297
which continued to cause confusion

16
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,341
during the police investigation.

17
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:33,384
And last night,

18
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,720
another body part was delivered
to a newspaper agency.

19
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,305
According to the autopsy result,

20
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:41,476
it is confirmed that the body part belongs
to the CEO of JQ, Jeong Sang-hun again.

21
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:44,562
We have confirmed that it was
extracted when he was still alive.

22
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:48,733
We believe that there is a possibility
that Jeong Sang-hun

23
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,610
may still be alive.

24
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:53,488
We will do everything
in our power to identify the culprit

25
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:56,449
as soon as we can
and apprehend the culprit.

26
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:05,333
Who is it? Who?

27
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,796
Who's doing this to him? Who?

28
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,215
Who is it? Who...

29
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,261
Meanwhile, Chairman Jeong Yeong-mun

30
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:17,887
had collapsed after hearing the news.

31
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,556
When the news broke out that he fainted,

32
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,558
there was a sharp dive
in JQ's stock price.

33
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,352
It's been a day since the incident.

34
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:26,938
However, JQ has not made
any official statements

35
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:29,607
regarding Chairman Jeong's health.

36
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:32,861
Ms. Kim, how do you feel right now?

37
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:35,405
Who do you think is behind this?

38
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:36,906
Do you have anyone in mind?

39
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,200
Did anyone hold a grudge against him?

40
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:41,452
What will be the next body part
and who will get it?

41
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,288
Do you think
that your husband is still alive?

42
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,175
EYE

43
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,727
I really can't be sure.

44
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:09,230
Why not? Did you find any signs
that he's dead?

45
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:12,025
Well, not really.
But I just thought perhaps,

46
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:14,193
we should assume that,
given the current situation.

47
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:17,071
Even if he's alive, he must be a mess.

48
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:20,617
When do you think the eye was extracted?

49
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,787
Do you see that?
It's just water. Plain water.

50
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:30,084
Organs and eyes get
decomposed first in corpses.

51
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:34,672
But it was delivered in the water
without any preservative agents.

52
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,507
And it still hasn't decomposed.

53
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:40,011
It was extracted 24 hours ago at max.

54
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,222
It's been less than a day?

55
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:46,100
Yes. I'm sure of it. The eye was extracted
a day ago when he was alive.

56
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,323
Is the suspect from the medical field?

57
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:03,034
Why do you ask?

58
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:08,081
The way it was extracted...

59
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:11,709
It was well-executed.

60
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:47,578
You've probably heard.

61
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:49,998
This time, his eye was found.

62
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:52,750
According to the medical examiner,

63
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:55,003
the estimated time of the extraction

64
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:56,629
is less than a day.

65
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:58,423
Then, you can't be the culprit

66
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:02,343
because you've been in our custody
since yesterday.

67
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,762
Right?

68
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:07,932
How do you feel?

69
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:11,227
Are you angry and sad as his friend?

70
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:14,856
Or are you just happy and relieved to be

71
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,607
off our suspect list?

72
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,197
I'm really dying
to know one thing from you.

73
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:27,535
Do you think
Jeong Sang-hun is still alive?

74
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:31,706
No, let me rephrase it.
Do you want him to be alive?

75
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:43,259
-You can go home.
-When Sang-hun was young,

76
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:45,470
he got easily scared.

77
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,350
One time, Sang-hun got hurt

78
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:54,062
when we were playing together.

79
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,525
He lost his pinky fingernail
when it got stuck between the door.

80
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:05,698
He kept crying about his fingernail
for three days in a row.

81
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,953
I actually got annoyed by it.

82
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:15,416
I asked him later
why he had cried so much.

83
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:20,379
He said he was so scared.

84
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,178
He must've thought
his nail wouldn't grow ever again.

85
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,725
I teased him about it for a long time.

86
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,522
Whenever I was on the phone with him
after he left for Germany,

87
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,151
I asked if his nails were intact.

88
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:47,657
I keep thinking about that day.

89
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,162
Since the day he came to the orphanage,

90
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,291
he cried in terror every night.

91
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,085
I keep thinking
about six-year-old Sang-hun.

92
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,386
I don't care if you believe me or not.

93
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,432
I want Sang-hun to come back alive.

94
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:17,770
That's what I truly want.

95
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,130
You're out.

96
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,176
When I first heard
that you were a suspect,

97
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,803
I didn't want to believe it.

98
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:54,432
I would've lost it
if I had to suspect you too.

99
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:58,436
I hoped that it wasn't you.

100
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:02,064
I knew that it couldn't possibly be you.

101
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,525
I thought

102
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:07,445
I was wrong to have suspected you, but...

103
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:09,989
But you weren't wrong.

104
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,076
You looked like a different person.

105
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,455
What happened to Jin Yeong-min
I used to know?

106
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:19,749
Which side is the real you?

107
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,292
You really had nothing

108
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:24,337
to do with Sang-hun's case?

109
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:28,883
Shouldn't you at least try to
explain it to me?

110
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,218
If I do, will you believe me?

111
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,014
You won't believe me whatever I say.

112
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,142
Believe whatever you want.

113
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:49,028
-Hey, she's here.
-She's here.

114
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:50,321
Hey, come with me now. Hurry.

115
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,031
-Ms. Kim.
-Ms. Kim. A word, please.

116
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:54,867
-Please share a word with us.
-We'd like to interview you.

117
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,160
-Ms. Kim!
-Hold on!

118
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:57,745
-How do you feel now?
-Wait.

119
00:08:57,995 --> 00:09:00,331
-Please do an interview with us.
-Move back!

120
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:03,000
-How do you feel right now?
-Will you keep your position?

121
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,586
-Did anyone hold a grudge against him?
-Do you know who did it?

122
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,547
-Do they have any suspects yet?
-Please comment.

123
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:09,924
-Anything you want to say to your husband?
-Move.

124
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:12,552
-What did the police tell you?
-Will you give us an interview?

125
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,220
-Any words for the press?
-Ms. Kim!

126
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:16,639
-Ms. Kim.
-Ms. Kim!

127
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:22,937
-Ms. Kim.
-Just a word, please.

128
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,400
At first, it was a hand. A foot was next.

129
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,110
And this time, it's an eyeball.

130
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,946
What's your take on the current case?

131
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:35,283
I'm not sure if you remember
the murder of a village supervisor

132
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,951
in Jeonggyeong-ri in 1998.

133
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:41,247
After Park, the village supervisor,
had been murdered,

134
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:44,166
his corpse was hanging under a tree
at the entrance of the village.

135
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,668
It was a gruesome case.

136
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:47,670
Right after the arrest,

137
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,298
this is the statement
the culprit made about the motive.

138
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:53,551
"I was going to reveal
my crime at some point.

139
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,553
That's why I left a message."

140
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:57,430
What kind of message?

141
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,850
When the culprit was arrested,
he was only 19 years old.

142
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:02,393
While growing up,

143
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:06,564
the victim, Park, had sexually assaulted
the culprit on multiple occasions.

144
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:11,110
The culprit told that to other people
in the village, but no one believed him.

145
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:14,572
And the incident escalated his hostility
against the whole village as well.

146
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:18,159
In the end, the corpse was hanging
under the tree at the entrance.

147
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:21,120
The act of displaying the corpse

148
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,164
was the message from the culprit.

149
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:25,958
-Then, are you implying that
-Why this agency?

150
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,752
these cases are similar?

151
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,253
Yes.

152
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:32,548
These cases may seem as separate cases
without anything in common,

153
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:36,344
but I'm sure there must be a message
from the culprit for this case as well.

154
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,679
The culprit is trying to make a statement.

155
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,681
We must be able to read the message.

156
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,020
Who is it?

157
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:47,897
Who is it?

158
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,858
He's in the crowd. I must find him.

159
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:56,572
I must find him.

160
00:10:58,366 --> 00:10:59,992
I can't see anything.

161
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:05,831
I can't find him.

162
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,344
What does this mean?

163
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:21,889
"Zero, two, one, four. Zero, three,
zero, three. Zero, three, zero, six."

164
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,933
Why did he give me the note?

165
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:29,105
"Zero, two, one, four. Zero, three,
zero, three. Zero, three, zero, six."

166
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,315
These numbers must mean something.

167
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,193
March 3.

168
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:37,738
March 3. That's the day Dad passed away.

169
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,240
Third...

170
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:43,077
Dad died on the 3rd.
And Sang-hun was taken on the 6th.

171
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,204
Zero, two, one, four.

172
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:47,790
February 14th.

173
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,127
What did I do on February 14th?

174
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:54,213
CHOI SU-HYEON: ARE YOU DOING WELL?

175
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,551
When the eyeball was delivered,
I received this message.

176
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,302
Who...

177
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:04,265
Who sent this message?

178
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:05,933
I'm looking into that as we speak.

179
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,269
If this message...

180
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:09,520
ARE YOU DOING WELL?

181
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:11,355
...was sent by the culprit,
at least it means

182
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:16,026
the culprit can't be from our side.

183
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,448
Then,

184
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,909
was Sang-hun's eyeball
delivered to the newspaper agency...

185
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:25,870
It cannot be a coincidence, sir.

186
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:29,748
I'm sure it's because of
the reporter, Ms. Choi.

187
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:34,462
I am certain that someone
is trying to dig up that incident.

188
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:39,550
I'm well aware
that you cherish Mr. Jeong very much.

189
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:44,054
However, if you let
the police investigate this further--

190
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:45,306
Are you asking me

191
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:48,934
to give up on Sang-hun? Are you?

192
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:53,063
If that incident surfaces,

193
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:56,609
all the effort you and I have made

194
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:58,360
will come to nothing.

195
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,446
Do you think

196
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:05,075
Mr. Jeong will be happy to have come
back alive if he finds out JQ collapsed?

197
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:06,952
Hey.

198
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:15,836
I agree with him, sir.

199
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:25,679
Tae-sik, can I ask you a question?

200
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:26,639
Don't.

201
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:32,186
Tae-sik, do you want
Jeong Sang-hun to come back alive?

202
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:35,064
-Or--
-Let's just drive in silence.

203
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,983
He doesn't have a hand.

204
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:41,654
He's missing a foot.
And he can't see with one of his eyes.

205
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:43,822
If he survives, that won't be living.

206
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,909
Then, are you telling me
that you'd rather have him dead?

207
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:50,663
That's not it. Would I say this
if things weren't this bad?

208
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,540
Even if he comes back alive,

209
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:55,709
I'd feel awful for Jeong Sang-hun
and Ms. Kim Seo-hui.

210
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:59,922
That's the cruelest way
to torture someone.

211
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:02,132
It doesn't matter how awful it is.

212
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,469
His family must want him
to come back alive.

213
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:09,932
If you have time for that,
think about how we can catch him.

214
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,433
Okay. We must catch the culprit.

215
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:14,436
I'm going to catch that crazy psychopath.

216
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:17,731
I'll ask the culprit the reason
behind this crazy act.

217
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:20,609
I'd like to ask
why the culprit is going this far, too.

218
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:23,862
The culprit didn't ask for ransom money.

219
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:27,449
Here's what I think.
The culprit must be a lunatic who feels

220
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:29,994
some kind of messed-up thrill
whenever he cuts off a piece.

221
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:31,328
I doubt that.

222
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:35,499
The culprit is telling us a message
with a definite agenda.

223
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:39,253
If the culprit isn't a lunatic,
and is doing this for some kind of agenda,

224
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,714
that sounds scarier.

225
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,466
What kind of agenda is
enough to torture a man like this?

226
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,970
I guess the culprit must want
to achieve the agenda despite the trouble.

227
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:55,644
BAREUN NEWS

228
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:59,315
The delivery company said
they didn't dispatch anyone for a parcel.

229
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,650
Do you remember
how the delivery man looked?

230
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:05,070
I can't describe his face
because he was wearing a helmet.

231
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,782
He had an average build for a guy.
But he was tall.

232
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:10,326
He was wearing the courier uniform.

233
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,329
-So you're saying he just looked ordinary?
-Yes.

234
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,372
How many times must he repeat himself?

235
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,875
Stop bothering our rookie.

236
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:21,295
We already made the statements
to the other detective yesterday.

237
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:23,964
You should ask that detective.
Let us get back to our work.

238
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:26,425
So there are 99 times left.

239
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:29,094
Until we solve our case,

240
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,971
we ask for statements all the time.

241
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,223
I'd appreciate your cooperation.

242
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:35,768
When you received the box yesterday,

243
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:38,479
was there anything else in the box?
Anything other than the eyeball?

244
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:40,731
-Anything suspicious?
-No, not really.

245
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:42,900
Nothing was written
for the sender and recipient.

246
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,777
Only your department was written on it?

247
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,487
Yes. It said our department on the box.

248
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:49,573
And nothing was inside?
Like a note or anything?

249
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:50,908
No, nothing.

250
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:52,993
Why the entertainment department of all?

251
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:57,456
Does anyone here have connections to JQ
or personally know Jeong Sang-hun?

252
00:15:57,831 --> 00:16:00,334
Or did anyone write an article
about JQ or Jeong Sang-hun?

253
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:02,378
This is the entertainment department.

254
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:04,630
We don't cover current issues or politics.

255
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,340
Why would we do that?

256
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:08,133
Oh, right.

257
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:11,178
We heard that Mr. Jeong
and his wife were separated at the time.

258
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:14,348
Isn't it because he had an affair?
Isn't that true?

259
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,392
-It was with a celebrity, right?
-An actress?

260
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,560
That is why the eyeball was sent
to our department.

261
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,729
Celebrity? Who? Actress?

262
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:24,274
When he and his wife separated, I--

263
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,276
Thank you for your cooperation.

264
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:35,494
Yes. They just left.

265
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:37,579
Is that all?

266
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,832
Did they ask about anything else?

267
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:44,753
Okay. Let me know immediately
if they come back again.

268
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,302
They just left.

269
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,934
Don't worry.
I don't think they found anything here.

270
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:02,604
Even if they come back, they won't
find out more than what they did today.

271
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:07,609
We blocked out everything
including the articles and the e-mails.

272
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:11,530
Please tell the chairman

273
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:14,450
that it will not leak from our side.

274
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:20,247
I think your concern should be
directed somewhere else, not here.

275
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,542
You don't need to worry about the police.

276
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:27,629
The chairman will make a decision soon.

277
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:33,343
Kim Seung-cheol's memorial service
and Songju RMC.

278
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,764
Up until now, the body parts were found

279
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:39,141
at places
Jeong Sang-hun had a connection to.

280
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:42,227
With that being said,

281
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:45,105
he must have
something to do with the newspaper agency.

282
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:51,445
Look at her. She's dozing off
when her senior detective is driving.

283
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,704
Tae-sik. Come on, can't you drive better?

284
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:03,874
Isn't that Ms. Kim?

285
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:11,215
At first, I thought Mr. Hong
and Mr. In were behind this.

286
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,050
Later, I even suspected Yeong-min.

287
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:15,219
But now, I don't know who's behind this

288
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,347
or why the culprit is doing this.

289
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:23,685
His hand, foot,

290
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,606
and eye this time.

291
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,777
Do you really think
the culprit left a message?

292
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,988
Yes. Probably.

293
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:38,033
I don't know what it is yet.

294
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:39,743
What could it be?

295
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:42,996
We must

296
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,582
find out what the message is.

297
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,585
I thought I sort of knew
what it was about,

298
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,295
but now, I'm completely lost.

299
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:52,589
We have to find out what that is.

300
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:55,217
What do you want?

301
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,177
Can you help me?

302
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:01,890
SEOUL POLICE AGENCY

303
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,643
How's Songju? Isn't the air fresh there?

304
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,729
Yes. I feel as if my lungs
are getting cleansed.

305
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,648
My gosh, stop exaggerating it.

306
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:13,193
It's about the JQ Jeong Sang-hun's case.

307
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,195
Where was it found this time?

308
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:18,031
At the entertainment department
of Bareun News.

309
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:22,077
Why did that eyeball end up there?
It's putting me in a tight spot.

310
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,997
So listen. It's nothing serious.

311
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:28,542
I guess there are some silly rumors
because Jeong Sang-hun's eyeball

312
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:31,420
was sent to the entertainment department.

313
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:36,717
How is he doing?

314
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,261
The guy who always follows you around.

315
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,848
Remember that guy?
I even awarded him a commendation.

316
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,141
Yes.

317
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:46,977
He's very talented.

318
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,105
And he's strong-willed too.

319
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:59,406
So you have been receiving these messages
from the culprit all this time?

320
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:03,285
But you didn't tell me
anything about it at all.

321
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,413
You're unbelievable.

322
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,166
Why do you people keep things from us?

323
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,293
You never give us straight answers.

324
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,503
No. You even hide what you know.

325
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:16,590
But you people ask me to find
your husband, your son, and your friend.

326
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:20,093
Why don't you just tell me what to do?

327
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,721
Forget it. I can't

328
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,641
work like this. This is beyond me.

329
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:27,267
Good luck.

330
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,313
Or he would have been killed.

331
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:34,066
If I told anyone, he would be dead.

332
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:35,275
How could I have told you?

333
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,152
How could you not?
This is crucial information.

334
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:40,572
Why? Were you worried I'd tell people?

335
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:45,786
You just couldn't trust me.
You didn't trust me.

336
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:47,371
No, Detective Jo.

337
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,665
That's why I'm here.
I'm telling you everything now.

338
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:53,085
Do you think this has been easy for me?

339
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,379
I did everything I was asked.

340
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:57,464
But when his body parts were found,

341
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:00,217
do you know how scared I was?

342
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,344
That's why I'm here.

343
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,763
I wanted to ask someone for help,

344
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:06,932
and you were the only person
I could think of.

345
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,528
I will not repeat myself.

346
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:23,323
We're looking for the same person.
Let's not work separately.

347
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:33,417
Zero, three, zero, three.
Zero, three, zero, six.

348
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:34,918
That's for Mr. Kim Seung-cheol?

349
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,837
Yes. That's the date when he passed away.

350
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:38,839
That's when Sang-hun went missing.

351
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,718
If these numbers signify dates,
this one must be a date, too.

352
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,678
February 14th...

353
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:48,932
That's before the incident.
Is it some kind of anniversary?

354
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:50,934
No.

355
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,811
Did anything suspicious happen
on this day?

356
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:57,190
It doesn't have to be suspicious.
Just tell me what you remember.

357
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:00,277
I kept thinking about the date.

358
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,572
I think that was the day.

359
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:07,784
Sang-hun, wait. Hey!

360
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:11,204
Sang-hun, what is going on?

361
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,792
Are you seeing another woman?

362
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:17,252
Let's talk another time.

363
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:22,215
-What happened then?
-Pardon?

364
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,468
Where did Jeong Sang-hun go after that?

365
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:27,346
You don't know?

366
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,105
A threatening message.

367
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,149
That's why.

368
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:41,193
That's why the culprit cut him alive.

369
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,404
He wanted Kim Seo-hui to believe
that her husband was alive.

370
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:46,823
Then, she'd comply with the demands.

371
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,450
MARCH 6, YANGGYE MENTAL HOSPITAL

372
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:49,409
Jeong Sang-hun.

373
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:52,412
He's still alive.

374
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:59,127
This person wanted Kim Seo-hui
to become an assemblywoman.

375
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:02,506
This person wanted to set up
the new business in Songju.

376
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:05,133
And

377
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,637
this person wanted
to take Jeong Sang-hun's seat.

378
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,055
JEONG SANG-HUN'S DISAPPEARANCE

379
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,646
Let's see which one of you

380
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:21,650
is the culprit.

381
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:26,446
KIM SEUNG-CHEOL'S DEATH,
JEONG SANG-HUN'S DISAPPEARANCE

382
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:47,467
WELCOME, MR. JEONG SANG-HUN

383
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:48,426

00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:02,149
HANDONG FUNERAL HALL

388
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:05,110
A funeral hall?

389
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,825
Hey.

390
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:13,451
Hey.

391
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:16,163
When is the foundation day of Bareun News?

392
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:18,206
-You have a computer there.
-Hey.

393
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:20,000
All right.

394
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:26,006
It's February 3.

395
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:30,260
When is the chairman's birthday?

396
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:32,387
Why do you keep asking things like that?

397
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:35,098
-Did you find out anything?
-No.

398
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,270

FOR YOUTHS STARTING BUSINESS

401
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,737
-February 14?
-Yes.

402
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:52,532
It was three months ago. I don't think
we have the security camera footage.

403
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,244
I'm sorry,

404
00:24:57,037 --> 00:25:00,040
but can I see the list of people
whose funeral was held that day?

405
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:02,125
That's...

406
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:04,294
This is important. Please help.

407
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,130
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY

408
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:08,757
Please wait.

409
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:16,014
I'm not sure whose funeral
Sang-hun attended that day.

410
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,141
Look.

411
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:20,227
I checked the list,

412
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:22,646
but there's no name I know.

413
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:23,730
HANDONG FUNERAL HALL

414
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:28,276
I thought it might be one of Father's
acquaintances or people from work,

415
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,861
but that wasn't the case.

416
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,073
Why did he go there?

417
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:38,453
I'm going to visit
all the people on the list.

418
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:43,541
-What's wrong, Detective Jo?
-Nothing.

419
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:45,877
I'll look into it too.

420
00:25:57,555 --> 00:25:58,682
As you said,

421
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,309
I told the investigation team

422
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,520
not to dig into Bareun News.

423
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:04,938
In that case,

424
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:07,315
it can't be helped

425
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:10,652
that it will be more difficult
to find your son.

426
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:15,532
Are you going to give up
on finding your son?

427
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:16,533
No way.

428
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,288
My people are also trying hard
to find Sang-hun.

429
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,082
I just need you

430
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:28,169
to take care of things as I've asked.

431
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:30,714
Okay. I'll be sure to do that.

432

LIEUTENANT JO TAE-SIK

443
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,405
I'm sorry I couldn't help you.

444
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,366
It's okay. I'm the one
who should apologize.

445
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:58,885
CHOI SU-HYEON

446
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:03,139
Right. It was February 14.

447
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,142
That's...

448
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:09,562
when she died.

449
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:12,565
I'm sorry,

450
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:16,403
but can you please check one thing?

451
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:18,113
That day,

452
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:21,991
did you see this man at the funeral?

453
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:26,788
Honey.

454
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:29,874
Come and take a look at this.

455
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:38,550
This man...

456
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:41,511
Isn't he that guy?

457
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:45,432
There was a man who came
late at night and cried a lot.

458
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:47,100
He cried?

459
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,144
I was out of my mind,

460
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,730
so I couldn't ask how he knew her.

461
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:55,525
But he was crying so much.

462
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:59,028
I just assumed he was
very close with Su-hyeon.

463
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:00,321
It's him, right?

464
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:05,076
When I saw him on the news, I wasn't sure.

465
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:10,081
Did he say anything else?

466
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,168
He said he was sorry.

467
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:16,379
He just kept saying that.

468
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:20,508
He just kept being like that
without saying anything else.

469
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,137
And he said he knew

470
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:27,348
she wouldn't leave like that.

471
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:30,935
He said he knew all that.

472
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:35,899
The police says Su-hyeon took her own life

473
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,818
after taking some pills,

474
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:43,072
but that's not true. That can't be right.

475
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:47,660
The night before she died, she called me
and said she wanted to eat my food.

476
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:50,497
She even told me she'd come the next day.

477
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,456
But why...

478
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:59,088
We asked the police
to continue the investigation,

479
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:04,260
but they wouldn't budge,

480
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:06,012
saying there's no evidence.

481
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:08,348
It's all water under the bridge.

482
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:10,099
No, it's not.

483
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:16,064
I still feel furious thinking about her.

484
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,071
Ma'am... I mean, Ms. Kim.

485
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:25,865
Please help us

486
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:29,202
find out what happened to Su-hyeon.

487
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,996
No one would listen to us.

488
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:36,793
Please help us.

489
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:39,754
Please help, Ms. Kim.

490
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:45,718
Someone died in the place,
so no one has moved in for months.

491
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:47,387
I see.

492
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:57,480
Thank you.

493
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:17,876
Hey, I found some pills.

494
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,753
Fluoxetine?

495
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:21,921
IDENTIFICATION CARD

496
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:23,840
I guess she'd been taking pills.

497
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:25,800
-What about a prescription?
-What?

498
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:28,845
Is there a prescription for the pills?

499
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:31,723
-I don't know. I'll look into it.
-Gosh,

500
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:34,559
what is her family going to do
when she leaves just like that?

501
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:39,355
-Dae-yong.
-Yes?

502
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:42,108
How long has it been since the accident?

503
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:44,903
We came right away after the report,
so it's been a couple of hours.

504
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,572
What more is there to think about?

505
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:49,657
We found her pills and suicide note.
That's it.

506
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:51,284
Darn.

507
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:53,244
I can't believe this is your last case.

508
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:54,495
There's no blood.

509
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,247
You're lucky.

510
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:59,626
Let's just go and have a drink.

511
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:01,920
Okay. Let's go.

512
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:05,006
Captain. Give me the pill bottle.

513
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:06,049
Okay.

514
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:09,260
Oh, right. Did you call Jin-gyeong?

515
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:16,142
I was out of my mind,

516
00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:18,269
so I couldn't ask how he knew her.

517
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:20,313
But he was crying so much.

518
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:24,150
I just assumed he was
very close with Su-hyeon.

519
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:42,418
Gosh, you startled me. What are you
doing here with the lights off?

520
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:44,545
Darn it.

521
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:47,048
What is going on?

522
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:50,551
Is anything wrong?

523
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:53,054
Dae-yong, do you remember Choi Su-hyeon?

524
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:55,223
The woman who jumped

525
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:57,558
off the rooftop of her apartment
a few months ago.

526
00:32:58,351 --> 00:32:59,435
Do you remember?

527
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:03,106
I guess she has something
to do with this case.

528
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:04,899
What are you talking about?

529
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:08,569
Bareun News. Choi Su-hyeon was a reporter
of the entertainment team there.

530
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,571
What about it?

531
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:14,242
And Jeong Sang-hun attended
Choi Su-hyeon's funeral.

532
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:16,494
How did they know each other?

533
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:19,038
There wasn't his number
in her call history.

534
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:21,874
We will find it out
after the investigation.

535
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:23,167
Investigation?

536
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:27,880
What? Are you going
to reinvestigate the case?

537
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:29,132
Think about it.

538
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:32,093
We got the hand
after Kim Seung-cheol died.

539
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:33,970
And we got the foot
after Kim Pil-yeon died.

540
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:35,888
If this is a routine,

541
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:39,809
the one thing we missed
from the beginning is

542
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:41,269
that they were murdered.

543
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:45,773
Kim Seung-cheol's case wasn't an accident,
and Kim Pil-yeon's wasn't a suicide.

544
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:48,860
So the eye delivered means
Choi Su-hyeon's case wasn't a suicide,

545
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:50,570
but a murder.

546
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:53,031
Tae-sik.

547
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,450
Are you writing a novel or what?

548
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:59,620
Choi Su-hyeon was suspended from work

549
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,330
and received psychotherapy.

550
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:03,499
We found antidepressant in her place,

551
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:05,626
and you're the one
who found her suicide note.

552
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,171
Besides her family's claim,

553
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:09,589
there's no evidence for murder.

554
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:11,007
The pills.

555
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:13,634
There was no prescription for them.

556
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:16,345
I checked the report again.

557
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,307
We didn't check the prescription.

558
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,434
We didn't even investigate
people around her.

559
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:23,686
-What?
-I remember seeing

560
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:27,023
two cups in her sink.

561
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:30,568
Right before Choi Su-hyeon died,

562
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,862
she was with someone in her place.

563
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:38,242
Okay. Fine.

564
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:40,495
It's absurd, but let's say you're right.

565
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:42,914
But it's been three months.

566
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:44,999
What are you going to do about it now?

567
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:46,876
We still have some

568
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:49,796
evidence left.

569
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:53,549
Choi Su-hyeon's body.

570
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:56,761
-It's not cremated.
-You crazy punk.

571
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:19,867
Hey, Tae-sik.

572
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:23,704
Will you cut me some slack?

573
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:29,836
I'm the one who made the report
for the case.

574
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:32,797
If you poke around the case
and find out something,

575
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:35,383
you might just be disciplined,

576
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:38,344
but I might be discharged.

577
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:40,388
I know, but we can't just let this--

578
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:41,347
Hey, Tae-sik.

579
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,767
You know I have five people
in my family to support.

580
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:46,978
If something goes wrong,

581
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,689
my whole family will
end up on the streets.

582
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:53,776
Do me a favor.

583
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:55,653
Will you

584
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:57,738
just stay quiet?

585
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:02,702
You know what I mean.

586
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,539
Please.

587
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:13,296
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY
CHOI SU-HYEON, 34, FEMALE

588
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:20,720
EVIDENCE

589
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:30,897
So...

590
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:34,066
what were you thinking

591
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:37,320
when you messed with Mr. Jeong?

592
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:41,741
I thought all the people from JQ
were just like you.

593
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:45,745
It turns out some of them
had a conscience.

594
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,289
And Mr. Jeong was one of them.

595
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,043
The horrible things.

596
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:54,837
How long did you think
you could hide them?

597
00:36:57,381 --> 00:37:00,343
Did you actually think
you could hide them to the end?

598
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:09,727
Things like that

599
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:12,104
are bound to be revealed in the end.

600
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:16,901
You'll see.

601
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:24,867
I'll be sure...

602
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:28,621
to shout out the truth...

603
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:31,624
until the end...

604
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:46,741
CHOI SU-HYEON: ARE YOU DOING WELL?

605
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:03,049
CHOI SU-HYEON

606
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:07,511
CHOI SU-HYEON

607
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:14,226
It's done.

608
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:17,730
All the online traces
of the target are deleted

609
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:18,981
except the basic information.

610
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:20,399
As you requested,

611
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:21,901
I set up the system

612
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:23,903
where you can get a message

613
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:25,654
when someone searches the name online.

614
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:27,114
Please check your email.

615
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,282
One more thing.

616
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:30,743
I'll send you a text message now.

617
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,746
Find out who sent the message.

618
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:38,125
CHOI SU-HYEON: ARE YOU DOING WELL?

619
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:14,036
It was Choi Su-hyeon
whom Sang-hun went to see.

620
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:15,621
Choi Su-hyeon.

621
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,540
She's a reporter for Bareun News.

622
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:19,375
The number 0214

623
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:21,836
means the date she died.

624
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:24,422
Perhaps, she might not have

625
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:26,549
committed suicide.

626
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:28,551
Her parents don't believe it. And...

627
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:31,637
Sang-hun said she wouldn't die like that.

628
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:35,266
The whole thing has been like that.
My dad and Kim Pil-yeon.

629
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:37,143
-She might not--
-I know.

630
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:39,895
-What?
-I investigated the case.

631
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:45,192
I recalled it
when I saw the list you gave me.

632
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:48,070
Right before Assemblyman Kim passed away,

633
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:49,905
I took care of the case.

634
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:51,782
Then...

635
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,872
The detective in charge was...

636
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:59,832
Yes, it was me.

637
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:03,919
Why did you close the case as suicide?

638
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:06,088
Because it felt like a nuisance.

639
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:09,216
Regardless of my situation back then,

640
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:13,012
I do admit that I ignored it.

641
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,061
Look into it again, then.

642
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:25,483
You can reinvestigate the case.

643
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:27,985
Are you scared?

644
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:32,323
Because you might have
actually made a mistake back then?

645
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:35,784
I'm scared too.

646
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:40,664
I keep finding out things about Sang-hun
that I didn't know.

647
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:43,375
But you see,

648
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:45,753
I'll deal with anything

649
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:47,922
if I can save Sang-hun.

650
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:49,757
Whatever it is,

651
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:51,592
I'll put up with it all.

652
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:56,180
So please help me.

653
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:00,935
Please reinvestigate the case
from scratch.

654
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:31,882
Look at me eating like a pig.

655
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:39,723
You bastard,
I can't believe you can eat now.

656
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:04,248
What's going on?

657
00:43:04,623 --> 00:43:06,208
Why did you call?

658
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,086
Are you still awake?

659
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:11,547
Is something wrong?

660
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,425
No, nothing's wrong.

661
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:18,137
How are you feeling? Any better?

662
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:21,640
I'm always the same, you know.

663
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:24,476
Have you been eating well?

664
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:28,314
Goodness, you ask me that question
all the time.

665
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:29,732
I'm not a kid.

666
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:31,483
I should

667
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:34,528
visit you and look after you.

668
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:37,114
I keep saying that I will
without actually doing it.

669
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,491
Don't worry about me.

670
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:41,160
Just do your job well.

671
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:42,786
And look after your health.

672
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:46,498
Whenever I see the news, I think...

673
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:47,666
Gosh.

674
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:50,544
What's this world turning into?

675
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:53,047
Right? It's a crazy world.

676
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:56,425
But...

677
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:59,219
I can't blame everything
on this crazy world anymore.

678
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:02,097
Tae-sik, if it's too hard,

679
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:05,476
just move back here.

680
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:07,895
It's nice to know you've got my back.

681
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:09,605
I'm okay though.

682
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:12,191
I'll be fine.

683
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:14,318
I have to be.

684
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:18,072
Gosh, you should go to sleep now.

685
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:21,325
All right.

686
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:47,309
The investors are getting anxious

687
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:49,728
because Mr. Jeong's case is blowing up.

688
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:52,731
A few foreign investors
have already backed out.

689
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:55,234
They'll pass the bill

690
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:57,861
in a few months.

691
00:44:58,153 --> 00:45:00,697
People equate the new business

692
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:02,408
with Mr. Jeong.

693
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:05,244
If his case remains unsolved,

694
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:08,580
it'll continue to tarnish
the new business' public image.

695
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,541
Sir.

696
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:13,752
At the moment, reassuring the investors

697
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:15,546
should be our priority.

698
00:45:16,588 --> 00:45:18,006
Since the case was made public,

699
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:19,967
our stock price has been dropping.

700
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:22,261
With all due respect, sir,

701
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:25,556
I think we now need
to dissociate ourselves from Mr. Jeong

702
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:27,099
and find a new face

703
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:30,686
who can represent the new business,
as soon as possible.

704
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:37,234
NOTICE OF APPOINTMENT

705
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:42,448
Are you serious?

706
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:44,158
He has the most knowledge

707
00:45:45,617 --> 00:45:48,620
of almost everything that's happened,
including Choi Su-hyeon's case,

708
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:50,831
so we should make him the face

709
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:53,041
of the business and not keep him
behind-the-scenes.

710
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:55,210
And we need

711
00:45:55,627 --> 00:45:57,963
someone who will take the fall

712
00:45:58,797 --> 00:46:01,884
just in case things go wrong.

713
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:05,220
NOTICE OF APPOINTMENT

714
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:07,306
I'll think about it.

715
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:09,683
You can leave now.

716
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:25,115
Tae-sik.

717
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:26,992
Hey.

718
00:46:27,784 --> 00:46:28,994
Why did you want to see me?

719
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:30,579
Why did you...

720
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:34,541
You called him too?

721
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:36,585
-You didn't get caught?
-You mean, by Captain?

722
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:39,046
You told me to sneak out,

723
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:40,797
so I acted like I was taking a phone call.

724
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:43,759
Well, what's going on?

725
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:46,178
Why did you want us to meet you here?

726
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:50,140
What is it?

727
00:46:52,392 --> 00:46:54,978
It's really embarrassing for me
to ask you this,

728
00:46:58,857 --> 00:47:00,484
but I made a mistake a while ago,

729
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:01,985
so I need to get it sorted out.

730
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:03,904
-What?
-Sorry? Come again?

731
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:07,157
What did you say?

732
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,787
Is he going to tell us next year or what?

733
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:13,997
What did he say?

734
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:15,582
Did something happen?

735
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:17,459
Say it louder, one more time.
What did you say?

736
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:19,753
Tae-sik.

737
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:21,547
Help me out.

738
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:27,261
I'll make sure you guys won't be affected
even if any problems arise,

739
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:29,972
so help me out.

740
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:32,891
Please, guys.

741
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:34,810
Help you with what?

742
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:39,565
Well...

743
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:41,858
Captain!

744
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:43,777
Captain.

745
00:47:44,444 --> 00:47:46,029
We received a tip.

746
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:48,240
An anonymous tip about knowing
where Jeong Sang-hun is.

747
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:50,284
-What?
-Tae-sik and Ho-gyu

748
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:52,244
already left. We should hurry.

749
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:53,704
-Hurry up.
-Where are we going?

Gosh, I knew it.

761
00:49:06,818 --> 00:49:08,528
Hey, I can't believe you thought

762
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:10,530
the prank caller
was actually giving us a tip.

763
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:12,366
I'm sorry, Captain.

764
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:14,743
I wanted to check it out just in case.

765
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:17,245
But this time, I'm sure of it.

766
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:18,747
Let's check one more place.

767
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,291
-Where?
-Well...

768
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:23,251
It's only 2km away from here.

769
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:26,129
I heard from the tipper again just now.

770
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:27,923
He saw Jeong Sang-hun in the area.

771
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:29,716
We should hurry.

772
00:49:30,008 --> 00:49:32,219
Hey, pull over.

773
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:34,763
-Sorry?
-I said, pull over.

774
00:49:35,597 --> 00:49:37,933
-Why?
-Pull over!

775
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,394
How dare you lie to my face?

776
00:49:41,603 --> 00:49:42,521
I'm sorry.

THIS PAGE HAS BEEN DELETED

799
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:23,413
I figured out
where that text message came from.

800
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:26,875
I think it's a burner phone
using Choi Su-hyeon's old number.

801
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:28,460
It was sent from

00:51:57,322 --> 00:51:58,740
I guess I'm moving.

810
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:03,578
JIN YEONG-MIN

811
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:14,923
Su-hyeon, please.

812
00:52:17,175 --> 00:52:18,844
You heard what I said.

813
00:52:20,345 --> 00:52:21,596
I practically begged you.

814
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:24,724
Why must you go to such great lengths
to help Sang-hun?

815
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:28,979
This won't change anything.

816
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:31,940
Nothing can stop the new business.

817
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:33,942
-So please--
-I will stop it.

818
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:36,862
I'll do my best until the end.

819
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:39,322
-What?
-Yeong-min.

820
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:42,158
Don't stay by Chairman Jeong's side.

821
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:43,869
You should leave.

822
00:52:44,911 --> 00:52:46,580
Just pretend you don't know anything

823
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:48,582
unless you're going to help us.

824
00:52:52,919 --> 00:52:53,962
Don't go.

825
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:56,798
You shouldn't go up there.

826
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:09,769
I'm sorry, Yeong-min.

827
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:30,874
Hello.

828
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:33,168
-Come on in.
-Thank you.

829
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:43,595
Could you show me the location?

830
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:46,431
Well, just a moment.

831
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:49,601
Oh, here. Have a look at this.

832
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:52,896
It'll be around here.

833
00:53:53,855 --> 00:53:55,357
That's what I'm thinking.

834
00:53:56,691 --> 00:54:00,570
It's very close to the location
I was looking into.

835
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:02,614
-Really?
-Yes.

836
00:54:02,864 --> 00:54:05,408
Then there must be a connection.

837
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:19,381
The text message was sent
from this apartment?

838
00:54:20,715 --> 00:54:22,217
Who's this bastard

839
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:24,678
that pulled such a prank?

840
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:29,015
Then you should've taken care of it
in advance.

841
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:31,893
I don't care what you do.
Do whatever it takes

842
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:33,269
to stop them.

843
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:42,487
It seems like Detective Jo Tae-sik
caused some trouble.

844
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:46,282
Will you just sit back and watch?

845
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:49,995
The news somehow reached you
as quickly as it reached me.

846
00:54:50,078 --> 00:54:51,871
If the Choi Su-hyeon case is exposed,

847
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:54,374
things can get very serious.

848
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:57,002
Choi Su-hyeon...

849
00:54:58,753 --> 00:55:02,465
You're talking as if she was
a complete stranger to you.

850
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:09,264
I am responsible for making sure
that the plan for the business

851
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:11,141
is executed without any issues.

852
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:16,146
I'm trying

853
00:55:16,938 --> 00:55:18,314
to find a way to do just that.

854
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:21,192
Results are what matters.

855
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:24,362
Bury the Choi Su-hyeon case
no matter what.

856
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:26,573
Do whatever it takes.

857
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:29,242
Let's try to get along,

858
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:32,037
Mr. Jin.

859
00:55:33,788 --> 00:55:35,165
No, my baby...

860
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:37,375
Su-hyeon!

861
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:43,423
My daughter, Su-hyeon. My gosh.

862
00:55:43,965 --> 00:55:46,968
Su-hyeon! Please...

863
00:55:48,803 --> 00:55:50,722
Su-hyeon.

864
00:55:53,266 --> 00:55:55,727
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

865
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:10,450
Are you all right?

866
00:56:11,576 --> 00:56:12,702
How did it go?

867
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:16,539
The direct cause was
a depressed fracture in the cranium.

868
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:19,667
It does seem like she died from the fall,

869
00:56:20,251 --> 00:56:22,003
but a drug was detected in her blood.

870
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:23,838
-An antidepressant?
-No.

871
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:26,216
Gamma-hydroxybutyrate.

872
00:56:27,675 --> 00:56:28,760
GHB.

873
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:30,845
GHB? The psychoactive drug?

874
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:35,391
Yes. But no signs of rape were found.

875
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:39,479
And the fact that the drug
still remains in the blood

876
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:41,648
means that she died
within 20 minutes of ingesting it.

877
00:56:44,109 --> 00:56:47,487
Did you say she jumped off
from the roof of a building?

878
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:48,696
Yes.

879
00:56:48,947 --> 00:56:50,406
Judging from the amount of GHB,

880
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:52,909
she must've lost her consciousness
as soon as she ingested it.

881
00:56:52,992 --> 00:56:55,078
She wouldn't even have been able
to move her fingers.

882
00:56:55,161 --> 00:56:56,412
-Then--
-Do you think

883
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:59,165
she went up to the roof on her own
in that state?

884
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:01,835
It was a homicide, right?

885
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:08,216
One thing I can say is that she must've
had no idea what was happening.

886
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:11,344
Whether she was taking her own life,

887
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:13,263
or if she was being forced into it.

888
00:57:16,432 --> 00:57:17,809
Detective Jo.

889
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:19,811
Are the higher-ups

890
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:21,771
really okay with this?

891
00:57:22,355 --> 00:57:25,024
You even dug her grave
to reinvestigate this case.

892
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:26,151
They didn't object?

893
00:57:32,073 --> 00:57:33,283
Dae-yong.

894
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:20,682
It was a homicide, right?

895
00:59:20,765 --> 00:59:23,434
Choi Su-hyeon was
working on a story about JQ?

896
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:24,936
I mean, she was a reporter.

897
00:59:25,019 --> 00:59:27,105
She must've backed up the file,
don't you think?

898
00:59:27,188 --> 00:59:28,565
This time, I'll do it properly.

899
00:59:28,648 --> 00:59:31,234
I want to find him before it's too late.

900
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:32,986
Tae-sik, we have a problem.

901
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:34,404
It's only circumstantial.

902
00:59:34,487 --> 00:59:36,155
Don't drag them into it and waste time.

903
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:38,741
But why has the culprit been telling me

904
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:39,909
everything he did?

905
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:42,453
Choi Su-hyeon's article
will probably tell us the answer.

906
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:44,914
It looks like
that's what started all of this.

907
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:46,332
Get started right away.

908
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:50,253
