THIS DRAMA IS A WORK OF FICTION.
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,

2
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:45,003
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGIONS, AND INCIDENTS
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:49,090
One, two.

4
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:51,342
-One, two.
-Stop that.

5
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:53,344
-That's enough.
-One, two.

6
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:54,846
I said stop!

7
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:56,598
Where is Sang-hun?

8
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:58,057
Tell me where Sang-hun is!

9
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:03,480
-Sang-hun!
-One, two.

10
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:06,649
-One, two.
-Sang-hun!

11
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,443
One, two.

12
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:10,278
What is he doing here?

13
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:12,697
-Well...
-I'm his dad.

14
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:16,242
Honey. Wake up.

15
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:19,245
Sang-hun, let's go home. What's wrong?

16
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:20,705
He's dead.

17
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:23,458
Pronounce him dead.

18
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:26,002
Jeong Sang-hun. May 26, 1994--

19
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,338
Get him up! Just pick him up.

20
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:29,964
-At 5:34 a.m...
-Quick.

21
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,925
That's not true. He's fine.
Sang-hun is fine.

22
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:33,343
He passed away.

23
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:34,886
Just help me.

24
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:38,807
Help me get him up. Now! Wake Sang-hun up!

25
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:57,033
Sang-hun, we're home.

26
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:01,037
It's been a long time, right?

27
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,622
YU EUN-SEONG, GRADE 2, CLASS 4

28
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:03,832
Let's go in.

29
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,585
Good. Slow down.

30
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,673
Hold it tight. That's good. Keep trying.

31
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:15,844
Are you all right? Let's try it again.

32
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,514
You can do this. Be careful.

33
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:21,975
Press down the pedals hard.

34
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:25,145
Good. There you go.

35
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:27,438
Sang-hun, what's wrong?

36
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:29,524
Come here. Let's do it again.

37
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:32,652
I can't ride a bike.

38
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,280
Sang-hun, what's wrong?

39
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:38,199
I'm not Sang-hun. I'm Eun-seong.

40
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:40,827
You're Sang-hun.

41
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:43,413
You can do this. Just try.

42
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,504
Good. That's right.

43
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:53,756
You're good, right?

44
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:57,218
Keep pedaling. Go ahead.

45
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,684
DISAPPEAR

46
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:18,907
What did Jeong Yeong-mun say?
Did he say he did it?

47
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,825
-Dae-yong.
-Yes?

48
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,493
We should bring him in.

49
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:24,162
Who?

50
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,167
You know why you're here, right?

51
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:31,586
I met your boss.

52
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:36,049
It turns out you two have been
hiding a lot of things from us.

53
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,222
When I first saw him at the orphanage

54
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,642
my wife was sponsoring,

55
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:50,313
I thought Sang-hun came back alive.

56
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:55,235
I felt like I got
another chance from up above.

57
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,156
He was just my son.

58
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:03,910
It didn't matter

59
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:07,163
whether he was my biological child or not.

60
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,040
Sang-hun is just my son.

61
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:11,292
Why did you put him away

62
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,295
when he means that much to you?

63
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:24,639
Mr. In.

64
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:27,475
Let go of me.

65
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,146
Mr. In. Why...

66
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:37,151
Why are you doing this to me, Mr. In?

67
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:40,571
-Why are you being like this?
-I heard it was your idea.

68
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:43,741
Why? Why did you do it?

69
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:48,246
Mr. Jeong was emotionally unstable.

70
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,917
When he was young, he had been treated
for an anxiety disorder.

71
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:56,838
I thought that he had gotten better,

72
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:00,300
but his condition worsened
after taking on the new business.

73
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:03,845
He couldn't cope under pressure, so...

74
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,932
I just thought it'd be good for Sang-hun.

75
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:12,770
I should have stopped him.

76
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,858
I let him trick me.

77
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:18,568
So you put him in a mental institution?

78
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,321
Driving a car,
registered under a fake name?

79
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,407
Goodness, that's quite scary.

80
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,535
In this field,

81
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,496
rumors get around really fast.

82
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:35,918
I've seen a lot of companies going under
because of some bogus rumors.

83
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:41,466
What would've happened
if the rumor about Mr. Jeong spread out?

84
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,093
It would've destroyed

85
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:47,055
the company as well as Mr. Jeong's future.

86
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:50,391
So are you saying it's not like

87
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,186
he went missing on March 3
in Miri-dong, Songju,

88
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:55,229
but he disappeared in the hospital
on March 6?

89
00:05:57,482 --> 00:06:00,568
Do you not know the place and time is
important for a case of a missing person?

90
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:04,989
Scores of policemen have investigated it
with false information for over a month.

91
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:09,368
Do you even want to find your son?

92
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,329
It's not like I didn't try anything.

93
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,484
Mr. Jeong, are you all right?

94
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,820
Mr. Jeong, are you okay? Nurse!

95
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,156
Do you hear me? Calm down. Breathe!

96
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,575
It's okay. Calm down and keep breathing.

97
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:52,036
Take a deep breath. It'll be okay.

98
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,473
What are you guys talking about?

99
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,433
-Hello, Doctor.
-Hello.

100
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,352
I'm starving.

101
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,020
-Do you want some?
-Thanks.

102
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,277
When I heard he disappeared,

103
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:26,487
I looked in every nook and corner.

104
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:29,407
But...

105
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:33,077
we had no idea who took him.
There was no trace.

106
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:37,498
There was no one
in the security camera footage.

107
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:42,503
And all I heard from Dr. Park
and Mr. In was that they had no idea.

108
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,631
Can you believe this?

109
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:48,759
Only the three of us knew

110
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:51,596
that Sang-hun was in the hospital.

111
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,599
I looked into it,

112
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:57,977
but there was nothing fishy
about Dr. Park.

113
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,605
And there was something about In Dong-gu?

114
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,484
Muyeon Industries.

115
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:07,570
It's your company.

116
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:08,863
Why?

117
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,908
If you cut your father off
and had him stand for a figurehead,

118
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,659
did you think I wouldn't figure it out?

119
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:20,708
JQ had to buy the land
from Mr. Choi anyway.

120
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,211
And I had no choice but to step up

121
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:25,254
when Mr. Choi ended up like that.

122
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:28,716
We had no time
to follow normal procedures,

123
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:32,011
so I just used the company
named Muyeon Industries.

124
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,805
But the land has nothing to do with me.

125
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:37,016
After Sang-hun was gone,

126
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,561
I looked into Mr. In's background

127
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,523
and found a familiar name.

128
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:45,525
Son Du-gang?

129
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:47,902
A long while ago,

130
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,573
he worked as my driver.

131
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:56,911
Because of him,

132
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:00,581
my wife and son died.

133
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,502
I had no idea.

134
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:08,339
That Mr. In was his son.

135
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,008
I was completely fooled by him.

136
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:14,679
He's been looking for a chance
staying at my side.

137
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:17,098
That brat knew

138
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:20,977
that Sang-hun wasn't my biological son.

139
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:24,313
He was waiting for the right time

140
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,817
to take Sang-hun's position.

141
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,779
I only stayed by Chairman Jeong's side

142
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,325
because I wanted

143
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,578
to pay for my father's crime.

144
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:41,247
But that's not what Chairman Jeong thinks.

145
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:45,167
You just wanted to take over
Jeong Sang-hun's position.

146
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,086
That's why you killed him.

147
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:49,213
I didn't do it.

148
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:57,305
Jeong Sang-hun went missing on March 6th.

149
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:01,267
You canceled a scheduled meeting
and disappeared for about two hours.

150
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,227
What did you do?

151
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:14,030
All right. Let's try again.

152
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,699
Why were you
on Gangneung Expressway at that time?

153
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:24,415
You went to the hospital
to hide Jeong Sang-hun.

154
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:27,209
I went there because I received a call
that he had gone missing.

155
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:31,130
You drove a fake vehicle again that day
and scrapped the car that night.

156
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,424
Did you scrap it
in case we found his traces there?

157
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:35,801
I was only trying to cover up
his traces at the hospital.

158
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,053
You're going to keep lying?

159
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:41,098
Do you think you can weasel
your way out of here with that excuse?

160
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:43,809
What will you do?

161
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:55,905
You've been following me for some time.
So you should know better than anyone.

162
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:00,785
Do you have direct proof

163
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,788
that I kidnapped Mr. Jeong
and cut off his limbs?

164
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:06,248
What?

165
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,002
You've been barking up
the wrong tree the whole time.

166
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:13,547
And I get that you're excited to have
something that looks like a lead.

167
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,132
But you should know when to stop.

168
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:16,967
You bastard.

169
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:20,805
How much longer will you waste your time
like an idiot?

170
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:29,688
What did you say?

171
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,327
OBSERVATION ROOM

172
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:45,037
That brazen jerk.

173
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,082
Can't we just put him in jail?

174
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,793
For what? We don't have any evidence.

175
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:52,545
He fabricated the security camera footage,

176
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:55,047
and bought Choi Chi-deuk's land
with a fake name.

177
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,007
He even drove an unregistered car.

178
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:59,844
He admits his guilt
and is willing to pay the penalty.

179
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,262
He didn't say anything wrong.

180
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:03,764
We can't issue a warrant
when there's no evidence.

181
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,057
Gosh.

182
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,226
We have In Dong-gu's attorney here.

183
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,437
So you're not suspicious of him?

184
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,856
Of course I am.
I'm just telling you the truth.

185
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,443
I'm so fond of him.

186
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,070
Let's just find out that darn evidence.

187
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:21,157
Do we have the search warrant
for the hospital?

188
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,616
Yes, I got one.

189
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,203
You're always so drastic.

190
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:27,830
What did you say?

191
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,957
Hey, what did you just say?

192
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:38,591
Seo-hui.

193
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:43,387
What?

194
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,183
When did you come?

195
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,358
Did you eat?

196
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,071
We can eat at home.

197
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,073
The weather is nice, so I want to walk.

198
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:04,783
Okay.

199
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:38,108
So if you truly wish
that your husband comes back alive,

200
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,361
just do what you're supposed to do.

201
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:43,989
I'm...

202
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,283
going to save you first

203
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:49,995
even if there's only a slim chance.

204
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:01,549
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY

205
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:02,550
MEETING ROOM

206
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:14,270
Assemblywoman Kim,
that's definitely a big decision.

207
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:16,939
Why did you not give me a heads-up?

208
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,525
I should've brought a cake or something.

209
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:23,070
Assemblywoman Kim, how do you feel?

210
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:25,823
I was really excited and emotional
when I first proposed a bill.

211
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:29,285
It's like sending my kid to school
for the first time.

212
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,995
That's how it feels.

213
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:32,121
Goodness.

214
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:34,790
Mr. Hong. We should gather everyone
on a historical day like this

215
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,042
and have a meal together.

216
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,211
We ought to.

217
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:45,926
We can eat whatever you want
or do whatever you want to do.

218
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:49,680
-Relay this message for me.
-What?

219
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,018
Tell him that he has to keep
his promise now.

220
00:14:58,272 --> 00:14:59,356
Hey, Assemblywoman Kim.

221
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,691
-What is it?
-Assemblywoman Kim.

222
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,068
-Assemblywoman Kim.
-Are you not coming?

223
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:05,112
What's going on?

224
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:18,834
Great work. I know that you
probably didn't want to go ahead with it.

225
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:24,423
I wonder if that was
the right thing to do.

226
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,927
If you didn't go through with it,
things would've been hard.

227
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:33,057
I know that my father
was against this bill.

228
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:37,478
I'm sure he had good reasons
to stand against it.

229
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,232
Do you think I made the right decision?

230
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:47,237
Your father said something like this
a long time ago.

231
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:51,700
"If the waves are too high,
stay out of the water.

232
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:55,037
If you try to stay in the water,
you'll be swept away."

233
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,540
When he told me that,
I thought it was quite random.

234
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,709
I guess he wanted me to tell you this.

235
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,590
I am sure your father probably

236
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,884
approved of your decision.

237
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,975
I told you not to worry, didn't I?

238
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:19,311
Kim Seo-hui isn't like that old man.

239
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:25,943
By the way, she said something odd today.

240
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,987
She said something
about keeping a promise.

241
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,489
Mr. In,

242
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:34,493
did you make a deal with her
behind my back?

243
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:38,956
We are just getting started now.

244
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,792
You should just focus on our next step.

245
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:43,460
And watch your tongue.

246
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,675
What a rude bastard.

247
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:57,975
As for now, the merger between
JQ Chemicals and JQ Industrial

248
00:16:58,058 --> 00:16:59,601
went smoothly.

249
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:03,230
The division of stocks you instructed
will go smoothly as well.

250
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,776
And Mr. Hong contacted me this morning.

251
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,320
The bill for the new business
was proposed.

252
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:14,199
The evaluation committee
will pass the bill without any problem.

253
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:15,993
There's no problem?

254
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:20,914
Is that what you think?

255
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:27,588
For now,

256
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:31,550
the police will consider me
the prime suspect.

257
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,972
I am well aware that you're also

258
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:39,683
suspecting me.

259
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:43,103
I will find him.

260
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:45,022
I will find Mr. Jeong

261
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,399
myself

262
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,152
and prove it to you.

263
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:01,789
Is that so?

264
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,251
Seo-hui finally proposed the bill.

265
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:11,173
That means that I don't need
to worry about this any longer, correct?

266
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:14,551
Since we complied with their request,

267
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:17,387
Mr. Kim Seung-cheol's reputation
will be maintained.

268
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,265
What about Seo-hui?

269
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:22,726
You're certain she has no idea, right?

270
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,520
Yes.

271
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:28,190
She will never know
how Mr. Hong threatened you

272
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:32,277
and why you had no choice
but to pressure her to run for office.

273
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:36,573
I am not complying

274
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:41,203
with their demand or staying quiet
because I think their demands are just.

275
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:44,623
However, to protect my family,

276
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:46,834
playing nice is the best card I have.

277
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,337
Please

278
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,882
take good care of Seo-hui, Mr. Kang.

279
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,844
I cannot let her walk

280
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,638
the same path her father chose.

281
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,265
Please help her.

282
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:03,559
I will.

283
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:12,568
There are no security cameras inside.

284
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:14,444
Okay.

285
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:24,121
How did this guy escape from here?

286
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:26,790
YANGGYE MENTAL HOSPITAL

287
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,083
Can you see me?

288
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,293
Yes.

289
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,505
But Jeong Sang-hun was never caught
on camera when he left the room.

290
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:35,424
That's probably the case.

291
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,303
Let's check if that's possible.

292
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,641
Okay.

293
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,911
I don't think that's it. No.

294
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:19,176
Unbelievable. She's got to
be the silliest detective ever.

295
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,221
Watch. You won't see me this time.

296
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:26,433
Jeez. Seriously?

297
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:33,649
Is she messing with me right now?

298
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,651
Unbelievable.

299
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,654
She sure tries her best.
I'll give her that.

300
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,075
Did you see me leave the room?

301
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:45,244
Yes.

302
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,579
Nothing worked?

303
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,748
Nothing.

304
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:54,461
What? How did this guy
get out of the hospital?

305
00:20:57,506 --> 00:21:00,217
Hey, mister! Hey!

306
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:02,803
Let's drink some cool makgeolli first.
Come over here.

307
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:04,429
-Okay.
-Have some snacks. Hurry.

308
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,431
-It's nice and cool. Come over now.
-Hello.

309
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:07,557
Hello.

310
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:08,767
-Hello.
-Hi.

311
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,728
-What brings you here?
-We just had a few questions.

312
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:14,356
Have you seen a man like this around here?

313
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:17,150
I don't know him.

314
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:18,986
Please take a look, sir.

315
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:22,614
Hello, ma'am. I just have a few questions.

316
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:25,867
Have you seen this man
recently around here?

317
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:29,621
-No, I haven't.
-I don't think so.

318
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,415
What about this guy?

319
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:33,000
I've never seen him, either.

320
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,167
-No?
-No.

321
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:35,377
He's handsome though.

322
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,754
Sir, have you seen this man around here?

323
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,840
-No, I haven't.
-Sir.

324
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:44,011
Okay. I got it. I'm sorry to bother you.
Have a good day.

325
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:45,470
Sir, you won the game.

326
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:48,307
Hello, sir.

327
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:50,684
-I'm sorry to bother you on your break.
-Hi.

328
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:52,894
Have you given a ride
to this man recently?

329
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:55,272
I'm not sure.

330
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:57,274
This is a small town.

331
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,735
If he escaped,
the locals would've seen him.

332
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,820
But no one has seen him at all.

333
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:06,033
Right. A guy like him would definitely
have had to leave the town.

334
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:09,328
He would've left ages ago.

335
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:11,371
To where though?

336
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,541
That's what we're trying to find out.

337
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:19,629
Wait, so no one outside the hospital
saw Jeong Sang-hun?

338
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:23,091
Right. We searched every nook
and corner of this town, but nothing.

339
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:24,843
Anything from the hospital?

340
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:28,305
I tried everything I could think of to
escape without getting caught on camera,

341
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:31,725
but there is no way he could've escaped
without getting caught on camera.

342
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:34,978
Even if you avoid the camera at the front,
there's one on the side.

343
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:36,438
Then there's also one in the back.

344
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:37,939
Perhaps, you were too slow.

345
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:42,277
My gosh, Detective Jo. She tried
everything she could at that moment.

346
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,321
-You saw that, right?
-But,

347
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,907
avoiding the security cameras
is impossible.

348
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,575
Show him. Spread it out.

349
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:52,537
You can't avoid being seen
on all these cameras even if you're good.

350
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:55,082
-There are a lot.
-To sum it up,

351
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:58,126
he can't avoid the security cameras.

352
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:00,587
But that doesn't mean
the cameras were off.

353
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:03,381
I mean, Jeong Sang-hun isn't a ghost.
He has to be seen on camera.

354
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:05,133
He must have found a way to escape.

355
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:10,138
That means there must be someone
who knows about that escape route.

356
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:14,726
Therefore, if they planted someone
inside the hospital...

357
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:17,979
-Then it makes sense, right?
-Right. Someone from the inside.

358
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,149
We must look into the staff more, then.

359
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:35,372
63D 5630

360
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,214
Damn it.

361
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:47,509
It was awful to see you
when my mom was there then,

362
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,427
it's still awful now.

363
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:52,931
How could you make mistakes
every single time?

364
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:57,769
Well, I was going to do
what you told me to do, but--

365
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,271
The entire plan is ruined

366
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:01,439
because of him.

367
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:04,901
Where is he?

368
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:07,404
I don't know, either.

369
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,072
Where is he?

370
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:13,034
I really don't know where he is. I swear.

371
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,413
I haven't been able to reach him
after that day.

372
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:20,917
I will report to you right away
when that bastard calls me.

373
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:22,919
Trust me.

374
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:29,718
I'll ask you a few questions now.

375
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,845
Before we proceed...

376
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,723
I am not addicted to games.

377
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:37,851
Okay.

378
00:24:40,478 --> 00:24:43,565
So no one knew
that the patient was Jeong Sang-hun?

379
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:45,859
Is that possible?

380
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:47,736
Well, it's not like he's famous.

381
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:50,989
Except for that day,
he didn't come out of the closed ward.

382
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:52,073
How would we have known?

383
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:55,118
Besides, no one would have thought

384
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:57,329
that a son of a rich family
would end up here.

385
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:01,291
You're in charge of the closed ward.

386
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:03,543
You were working on March 6th.

387
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:06,463
Do you remember anything
about Jeong Sang-hun from that day?

388
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,966
Or did anyone from the staff show
special interest in Jeong Sang-hun?

389
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:15,055
He required special care from the staff,
so I paid attention to the patient.

390
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:16,514
Special care?

391
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:18,058
High-risk patients.

392
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:20,185
We always accompany the patients

393
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:23,313
when they eat or go out for walks
to ensure they don't do anything risky.

394
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:26,233
And we ensure they have
no outside contact. Things like that.

395
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:29,319
Jeong Sang-hun required
that much special care from the staff?

396
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,696
Did he cause a ruckus or something?

397
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,991
No, except for that day,
he didn't even throw a fit.

398
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:39,204
If I had to pick something odd about him,
that must be it.

399
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:41,706
He was way too quiet and calm.

400
00:25:45,543 --> 00:25:47,837
Have you seen this man before?

401
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:52,133
No.

402
00:25:57,847 --> 00:26:00,225
So he disappeared from this room.

403
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:21,454
My gosh, how did he get
Jeong Sang-hun out of this hospital?

404
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:43,018
Did you get any leads?

405
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:47,105
No, they know nothing
about Jeong Sang-hun.

406
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:49,024
And they've never heard of In Dong-gu.

407
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:51,860
How could they not know a thing about him?

408
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:55,864
Do they really not know
or are they just pretending?

409
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:58,742
I'm certain that one of them
has to be lying to us.

410
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:02,037
How can we find that person?

411
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:03,913
Is it possible

412
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:08,335
-that everyone is telling us the truth?
-What?

413
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:09,919
Think about it.

414
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:13,548
If someone from the hospital indeed took
Jeong Sang-hun under In Dong-gu's order,

415
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,550
he or she'll be too scared to stay.

416
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:18,762
When Jeong Yeong-mun and we are
turning the place upside down?

417
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:23,350
You're right. Let's go.

418
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:46,247
Damn it.

419
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:59,177
So this was the escape route.

420
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,972
He crawled his way out of here to survive.

421
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:00,405
What is this?

422
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:06,202
It only leads up to here.

423
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,123
Excuse me.

424
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:13,126
Right here. Up here.

425
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:15,503
Where is this place?

426
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:17,547
My gosh, my apologies.

427
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,257
There's a man! A man!

428
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,593
Wait! Ma'am!

429
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:23,303
Damn it.

430
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:29,434
Can I open this from inside?
How can I open this?

431
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:31,019
REGISTRATION

432
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:33,021
-Here's the list of the staff.
-Thank you.

433
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:35,732
LIST OF EMPLOYEES

434
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:39,486
Jeong Sang-hun disappeared on March 6.

435
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:40,737
That's not it.

436
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:45,867
This isn't it.

437
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:51,164
There's one on March 7.

438
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,959
Let's see.

439
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:57,962
You're right.

440
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:00,924
This bastard quit right
after Jeong Sang-hun had gone missing.

441
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:02,967
It has to be him.

442
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:07,597
Hey, you found us a lead.
Highlight his name. Do it now.

443
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,809
PARK SEONG-JAE

444
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,524
Goodness, look at these eggs.

445
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:19,442
FOOD STORAGE

446
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:22,362
"Food storage."

447
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:27,408
Let's see.

448
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:31,704
Jeong Sang-hun disappeared at 7:30 p.m.

449
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:36,793
Okay. Please play the footage from here,
but the one in front of the food storage.

450
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:37,919
Okay.

451
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:44,175
Why did the laundry cart...

452
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:46,886
Is the laundry room connected
to the food storage?

453
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,012
No.

454
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:57,063
Wait. Can you rewind the footage
to when he took the laundry cart inside?

455
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:07,574
Play the footage
when the cart went in and out.

456
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:28,928
FOOD STORAGE

457
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,600
JEON HO-GYU

458
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:00,228
What is it?

459
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,399
DOCTOR PARK

460
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:08,361
You have quite the appetite.

461
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:12,407
How could you have your meal
when your hospital is in a mess?

462
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:17,620
I already told you what I know.

463
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:21,749
The day after Jeong Sang-hun went missing,

464
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:23,835
a part-timer quit.

465
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,256
Must I know about a part-timer who quit?

466
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:31,092
I'm talking about your nephew.

467
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:33,594
PARK SEONG-JAE

468
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,763
Park Seong-jae. He's your nephew, right?

469
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:39,475
Come on.

470
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:43,771
Park Seong-jae was the one who kidnapped
Jeong Sang-hun under In Dong-gu's order.

471
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:45,690
Right.

472
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,817
Isn't that true?

473
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:50,903
Where is this guy right now?

474
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:30,318
We believe that Jeong Sang-hun
was kidnapped through the vent

475
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:33,237
and that he ran away to the hill
behind the hospital after getting out.

476
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:36,115
Therefore, as of now,
we will divide into two teams

477
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,575
to proceed with our search.

478
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,828
One of the teams will
check Park Seong-jae's card statements

479
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:44,290
and call history to find out
about his whereabouts now.

480
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:47,543
As for the search team, try to find
a route Jeong Sang-hun could have taken

481
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:48,669
if he ran away to the hill

482
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:52,381
or thoroughly investigate
if he is actually buried at the hill.

483
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:54,050
We'll start the search from this point

484
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:56,719
while keeping the distance
to the left and right.

485
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:59,388
-Begin!
-Yes, sir.

486
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:03,851
Don't do a half-hearted job. Be thorough.

487
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,186
-Okay.
-Okay.

488
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,984
Logically speaking, we won't find
anything here. It's been over a month.

489
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:14,821
We're searching this place
because we're that desperate.

490
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:17,782
Hey, hey. Come over here. Dig up here.

491
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:20,660
No, we need another way to do this.
You think digging it up will do?

492
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,538
Hey, take out your hands from your pocket.

493
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:24,997
Come and dig this up.

494
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:39,428
Why haven't I heard from him?

495
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,349
Is there more for me to do?

496
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:53,776
Hello?

497
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:56,946
I need you to come here.

498
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:06,289
Hey, this is it for the day.

499
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:07,707
Let's come back tomorrow morning.

500
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:10,293
Didn't you see the forecast?
There will be a rainstorm tomorrow.

501
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:13,963
If it rains, whatever traces
of Jeong Sang-hun left here will be gone.

502
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:14,881
Damn it.

503
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:17,466
Hey, when we find Jeong Sang-hun,

504
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,886
we should ask Jeong Yeong-mun
for some stocks. You know?

505
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:21,804
We're working our ass off here.
He can give us--

506
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:24,056
Hey. My goodness.

507
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,933
-Hey, no! Don't step on it!
-What?

508
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,602
-Don't!
-Are you all right?

509
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:31,022
Hey, you stay right there.
Stay right there. Don't move.

510
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:34,192
-Hey, I'm your senior officer!
-Don't move.

511
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:45,161
-Isn't that a tire mark?
-Yes.

512
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:49,207
I don't think
people would drive cars up here.

513
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,213
The culprit came to pick him up?

514
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:41,092
-Hey, when can I get up?
-Okay.

515
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:43,052
Be careful not to step on it.

516
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:46,097
Goodness, look at you.
You found us a lead, Captain.

517
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,181
-Jeez.
-My gosh.

518
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,892
Did you see that? Did you? I did it.

519
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:52,395
Hey, you've still got it.
Did you see that?

520
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:54,772
-I told you we'd find something.
-Yes, we did.

521
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:56,607
-Admit that you were wrong.
-What's this?

522
00:37:56,857 --> 00:37:59,694
Damn it. They said it'd rain tomorrow.
They never get it right!

523
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:02,029
Hey, KCSI! Hurry up!

524
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:03,364
-Hurry up.
-Tae-sik.

525
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:05,700
-Right here.
-Did you call her here?

526
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:09,578
She didn't have to come all the way here.

527
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:12,915
You should go down.
I'll be down there in a minute.

528
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,209
Hey, try to cover it up.

529
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:18,713
Hurry. It can't get wet.

530
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:26,137
-Give me that umbrella.
-What?

531
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,054
Give me the umbrella.

532
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:31,559
Take this.

533
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:38,858
What is going on?

534
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:41,527
Why was Sang-hun at a place like this?

535
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:43,070
Your husband actually went missing

536
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:44,613
on March 6,

537
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:46,198
not March 3.

538
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:48,701
What do you mean?

539
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:52,330
He was at this hospital for three days
before he disappeared.

540
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:54,790
We're trying to find out
how he got out of the hospital

541
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:56,375
and where he went.

542
00:38:58,586 --> 00:38:59,712
But who...

543
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:03,174
Who brought Sang-hun to a place like this?

544
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,679
It's Mr. In, isn't it?

545
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:11,974
He's the one who did this, right?

546
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:16,103
Mr. In abducted Sang-hun
and brought him here, didn't he?

547
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:19,315
Then why aren't you arresting him?

548
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:21,776
You have to go arrest him immediately.
Sang-hun...

549
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:24,111
We need to find out where Sang-hun is.

550
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:26,030
Why aren't you arresting him?

551
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:29,200
Sang-hun's father doesn't know yet, right?

552
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:32,370
Don't call him.

553
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:33,746
Why not?

554
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:35,831
Chairman Jeong

555
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:40,336
knows that his son was here
and that this is where he disappeared.

556
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,338
Also...

557
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:47,927
You should meet Chairman Jeong.

558
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:52,014
There are more things
that you need to hear from him.

559
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:57,228
NEW HOPE CHILDREN'S FOUNDATION
20TH ANNIVERSARY

560
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:58,562
These days,

561
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:02,733
being a socially responsible company
is a must,

562
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:04,985
not a choice.

563
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,446
Someone once said

564
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:09,073
that making donations

565
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:13,202
is like rescuing a child
drowning in a shallow pond.

566
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:15,413
We donate...

567
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:23,295
We donate to those in need of help
because we can do it.

568
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:27,716
The photo isn't clear. Do you think
you can find out anything?

569
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:29,885
Give me a few minutes, please.

570
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:32,847
What do you want me to compare this to?

571
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:35,891
This car.

572
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:38,686
How long will it take?

573
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:40,729
I'll have a better idea
once I get started.

574
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:44,525
I came from Gangneung.

575
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:49,238
I heard Sang-hun was there.

576
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:52,867
He was there
before he went completely missing.

577
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:54,410
But how...

578
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:56,662
I mean, how did Sang-hun end up there?

579
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,167
Father,

580
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:04,837
did you really know all along?

581
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:10,593
Mr. In took Sang-hun to that hospital.

582
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:13,471
Did you really know about it, Father?

583
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:17,016
But how...

584
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:21,437
How could you not tell me anything? How?

585
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,480
Sang-hun...

586
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:25,566
was very ill.

587
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:27,485
Back then,

588
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:30,613
I thought I had no other choice.

589
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:34,366
I didn't know how to bring it up to you.

590
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:40,247
I just couldn't tell you.

591
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:43,000
Still, you should've told me.

592
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,794
I, of all people, should have known.

593
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:46,837
Well...

594
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:49,381
I'm sorry.

595
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:52,426
I...

596
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:54,970
didn't expect
something like that would happen.

597
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:01,393
I can't believe that I was the only one
who didn't know anything.

598
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:09,068
I thought I knew everything
about Sang-hun.

599
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:11,403
I was sure I knew him better
than anybody else did.

600
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:14,740
But I knew nothing, Father.

601
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:20,120
I do have the right
to know everything, don't I?

602
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:24,708
Can't you please just tell me
everything about Sang-hun?

603
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:29,380
Please, Father.

604
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:36,887
Seo-hui.

605
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:12,840
A TIRE MARK WAS DISCOVERED

606
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:20,306
BANK TRANSACTIONS

607
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:22,891
Hey, anything new?

608
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:26,895
That's odd. My sixth sense tells me

609
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:29,315
that it's about time
Park Seong-jae did something.

610
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:32,276
Your sixth sense?

611
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:34,778
Do you even know what it means?

612
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:37,489
Then what are the six senses?

613
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:38,949
The six senses?

614
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:41,285
They're the bodily senses.

615
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:43,871
Whatever.

616
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:46,206
Jin-gyeong, use your common sense.

617
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:48,292
If he's trying to lie low,

618
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:51,337
he obviously won't use
his credit cards or his phone.

619
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:55,466
In my opinion, it's highly likely
that Park Seong-jae is already dead.

620
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:59,303
Why? Take Kim Pil-yeon
and Choi Chi-deuk for example.

621
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:01,764
And seen from the perspective
of criminal psychology as well,

622
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:04,767
would In Dong-gu spare his life
after using him in a crime?

623
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:06,310
No way. He's already dead.

624
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,231
Wait, excuse me.

625
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:15,069
When are you going to pay for your room?
You just keep saying that you'll pay me.

626
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:16,612
Hold on.

627
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:19,406
Your wallet is right here.

628
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:25,621
You think he's dead?

629
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:30,209
Jin-gyeong, I'll let the higher-ups know
about the inefficacy of this system,

630
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:33,545
where we're just sitting
in front of the computer...

631
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:34,505
MESSAGE FROM THE BANK

632
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:36,215
-What is this?
-What?

633
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:38,467
A TRANSACTION DETECTED IN THE ACCOUNT

634
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:47,351
CREDIT CARD TRANSACTION, CHOGANG MOTEL

635
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:51,230
"Chogang Motel"?

636
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:54,733
Take your card. Here you go.

637
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,154
What is it?

638
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:00,864
What happened?

639
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:03,742
Gosh, he actually used this credit card.

640
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:04,743
I'm sorry.

641
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:06,829
I'll call Tae-sik.

642
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:09,665
Send me the location, okay?

643
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:11,083
-All right.
-I'll go and catch him.

644
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:12,376
Okay, see you.

645
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:21,468
-Are the results out?
-Yes. It's not that car.

646
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:22,678
What?

647
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:23,971
Are you sure?

648
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:27,683
Yes. Initially, I thought he changed
the tires, but that's not the case.

649
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:29,476
The tire width is completely different.

650
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:32,646
This tire can't be used for vans.

651
00:45:32,729 --> 00:45:35,732
Then whose car is that?

652
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:38,485
-You're asking me whose car that is?
-Hey.

653
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:40,446
Detective Jo,
we got Park Seong-jae's location.

654
00:45:40,779 --> 00:45:41,947
-Where is he?
-Hey.

655
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:44,950
-What do you mean?
-Move your car.

656
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:46,910
You suddenly cut in front of me.

657
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:48,787
-You cut in out of the blue.
-Mister.

658
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:51,748
-Move your car, will you?
-Jeez, why are they blocking the road?

659
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:53,250
You're blocking traffic.

660
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:54,960
-Seriously!
-Move your car, please!

661
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:56,378
-Gosh.
-I'm in a rush.

662
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:57,963
Move your car and wait for the police.

663
00:45:58,046 --> 00:46:00,466
It's been almost an hour
since the card transaction took place.

664
00:46:00,632 --> 00:46:01,800
He'd still be there, right?

665
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:04,470
-Ma'am!
-How will you compensate me for this?

666
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:06,638
-Move your car!
-We're all in a rush!

667
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:10,017
-Hang on.
-Gosh, these people...

668
00:46:10,976 --> 00:46:12,895
Hey, let's just wait.

669
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:15,063
Who knows when
the accident will be cleared?

670
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:17,524
-I'll meet you there.
-Wait, hey! That little...

671
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:20,360
Driving would still be faster.

672
00:46:57,564 --> 00:47:00,275
It's the day we first met.

673
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:03,028
Sang-hun.

674
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:06,949
I didn't know you were still
using the date as your password.

675
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:50,242
Seo-hui.

676
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:55,455
Come on. What was that?

677
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:58,834
-Show me.
-No, I can't.

678
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:05,007
I love this place.

679
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:07,926
-Really?
-Yes.

680
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:15,642
How did you find out about this place?

681
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:18,604
Well, you know.

682
00:48:21,189 --> 00:48:23,150
You came here with your ex-girlfriend,
didn't you?

683
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:25,319
Yes.

684
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:29,656
I was just kidding.

685
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:34,244
This place reminds me of you.

686
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:37,414
How?

687
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:39,541
It just does.

688
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:44,463
A while ago,

689
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:47,174
I happened

690
00:48:48,216 --> 00:48:49,301
to stumble upon this place.

691
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:52,846
It was covered in snow that day.

692
00:48:52,929 --> 00:48:54,931
Really? It must've looked beautiful.

693
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:56,058
Yes.

694
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:57,809
And seeing

695
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:01,021
that snowy landscape

696
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:05,484
really comforted me for some reason.

697
00:49:06,985 --> 00:49:09,029
Thank you for bringing me
to such a beautiful place.

698
00:49:14,951 --> 00:49:17,162
Since that day,
I've come here alone a number of times

699
00:49:18,705 --> 00:49:20,290
on the days when I was stressed out.

700
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:24,586
Alone?

701
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:30,550
Really? Why?

702
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:36,223
From now on,

703
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:39,267
you have to tell me everything
when you're stressed out about anything.

704
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:41,436
I'll be...

705
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:44,856
a great listener.

706
00:49:47,859 --> 00:49:48,735
Okay?

707
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:50,946
You have to tell me everything first.

708
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:55,409
Aren't we getting married to be there
for each other at such times, after all?

709
00:49:58,578 --> 00:50:00,455
You're the last person I'd open up to.

710
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:01,456
Hey.

711
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:03,291
Come here.

712
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:05,210
Hey, get back here. Hey.

713
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:06,545
-Hey!
-Gosh, be careful.

714
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:08,588
Tell me everything!

715
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:12,342
-Okay? Tell me, please.
-Goodness.

716
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:15,595
-Answer me at once.
-Hey, I can't talk like this.

717
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,681
-What did you say?
-You're...

718
00:50:46,668 --> 00:50:48,503
I miss you, Sang-hun.

719
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:07,606
I'm just baffled.

720
00:51:37,552 --> 00:51:40,096
Darn it. Excuse me!

721
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,473
What was that about?

722
00:51:48,104 --> 00:51:49,147
Hello?

723
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:53,193
Hello.

724
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:56,321
I'm a police officer.
This guy is staying here, right?

725
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:59,574
Gosh, I knew there was something sketchy
about this guy. He didn't pay for the room

726
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:00,951
and refused to check out.

727
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:02,619
-What's the room number?
-He's weird.

728
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:03,578
-Which floor?
-Why?

729
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:05,956
-What floor?
-Go to Room 504.

730
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:09,334
-Room 504.
-I knew something would happen.

731
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:13,088
Room 504.

732
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:20,178
Damn it.

733
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:21,555
Chogang...

734
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:23,098
Chogang Motel.

735
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:25,642
Chogang.

736
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:32,440
-Open up!
-Goodness.

737
00:52:33,066 --> 00:52:35,151
-What's the room number?
-That is

738
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:37,028
-Room 504.
-Do you have... Is this the key?

739
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:38,488
That's the master key.

740
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:39,447
Wait!

741
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:41,700
Park Seong-jae!

742
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:44,202
Open up.

743
00:52:44,786 --> 00:52:48,498
I'll count to three. One, two, three!

744
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:52,460
-Hey, what the heck are you doing?
-Tae-sik.

745
00:52:54,796 --> 00:52:55,922
Park Seong-jae.

746
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:57,215
Park Seong-jae...

747
00:52:58,091 --> 00:53:01,052
Hey. Don't do that. Jeez.

748
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:03,388
-Damn it.
-Damn it.

749
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:05,640
That guy...

750
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:09,519
God damn it.

751
00:53:11,104 --> 00:53:12,898
Oh, boy. Jeez.

752
00:53:13,481 --> 00:53:15,066
Tae-sik, don't. Tae-sik!

753
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:18,612
-Hey, go down and chase him.
-Go down...

754
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:20,405
Okay! Damn it.

755
00:53:41,426 --> 00:53:42,928
Shit.

756
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:44,512
Jeez, that bastard.

757
00:54:57,836 --> 00:54:59,337
Where did he go?

758
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:25,071
Hey!

759
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:31,494
-You bastard!
-Gosh.

760
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:34,456
Had I run like this
back when I was in the national team,

761
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:36,916
I would've definitely won a gold medal.

762
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:38,376
I caught him.

763
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:39,669
Gosh, this bastard.

764
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:41,504
-Let's get him up.
-Get up.

765
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:44,049
-Gosh, that hurts!
-Pipe down. Don't be such a baby.

766
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:49,929
Park Seong-jae, you got
Jeong Sang-hun out of the hospital, right?

767
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:51,431
-No, I didn't.
-Bullshit.

768
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:54,726
Then why did you quit your job
at the hospital and disappear?

769
00:55:54,809 --> 00:55:56,478
Where is Jeong Sang-hun now?

770
00:55:56,561 --> 00:55:58,104
He's not at the motel.

771
00:55:58,188 --> 00:56:00,607
How would I know where that man is?

772
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:01,858
You punk.

773
00:56:01,983 --> 00:56:04,319
Hey, we know that you got him out
through the vent

774
00:56:04,402 --> 00:56:06,696
and took him to the woods
through the rear exit.

775
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,907
It's all caught on the security footage,
you bastard.

776
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:10,909
Let me explain what happened.

777
00:56:11,284 --> 00:56:14,788
He approached me first, saying
he wants to get out of the hospital.

778
00:56:15,955 --> 00:56:17,248
I should just cuff you.

779
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:18,875
-What do you want from me?
-Come on.

780
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:20,043
-Come on!
-Hold on.

781
00:56:20,835 --> 00:56:23,463
Look at this prick.
This watch isn't yours, right?

782
00:56:23,588 --> 00:56:26,341
You stole Jeong Sang-hun's watch,
didn't you?

783
00:56:26,424 --> 00:56:28,760
Damn it. He gave it to me.

784
00:56:29,761 --> 00:56:34,224
If you're going to lie,
at least say something that is believable.

785
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:36,935
Hey, who put you up to this?

786
00:56:37,018 --> 00:56:38,645
What the hell are you talking about?

787
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:40,897
He walked out of there of his own accord.

788
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:43,149
Shut it. Let's just talk
at the station, then.

789
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:45,235
Jeez, seriously!

790
00:56:45,318 --> 00:56:46,277
I told you.

791
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:51,908
He approached me first. He asked me
to lend him my phone, so I did.

792
00:56:52,492 --> 00:56:55,411
Then I helped him escape the hospital.
That's really all.

793
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:57,330
Sure, we heard you.

794
00:56:57,413 --> 00:56:58,289
Hey, hold on.

795
00:56:58,998 --> 00:57:01,209
You lent Jeong Sang-hun your phone?

796
00:57:02,043 --> 00:57:05,588
He said his wife had no idea
about him being there.

797
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:08,716
I felt bad, so I let him use my phone
to call his wife.

798
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:09,634
His wife?

799
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:14,055
Hey, check his phone.

800
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:15,557
-Give me your phone.
-Damn it.

801
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:17,016
-Where is it?
-Jeez.

802
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,977
-Where's your phone?
-Here you go.

803
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:29,737
YEONGWON CHILDREN'S HOME

804
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:31,614
Children's home?

805
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:40,331
Is this really where you grew up?

806
00:57:48,214 --> 00:57:49,382
This must be it.

807
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:50,550
What's the number?

808
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:51,593
Zero, one, zero.

809
00:57:52,218 --> 00:57:53,636
One, four, six.

810
00:57:55,722 --> 00:57:56,973
And?

811
00:57:57,056 --> 00:57:58,349
Four, one, five, nine.

812
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:05,523
YEONGWON CHILDREN'S HOME

813
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:16,409
Eun-seong and Yeong-min.

814
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:18,244
Stay healthy

815
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:20,872
and always be there for each other
like you're doing now.

816
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:27,587
That's Yeong-min?

817
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:38,056
JIN YEONG-MIN

818
00:58:54,113 --> 00:58:55,406
POWER OFF

819
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:52,088
Why do you think he hid the fact

820
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:55,174
-that he spoke to Jeong Sang-hun?
-I didn't want any misunderstanding.

821
00:59:56,217 --> 00:59:58,094
"Misunderstanding"?
You're an interesting guy.

822
00:59:58,761 --> 01:00:01,139
You can reinvestigate the case.

823
01:00:01,681 --> 01:00:04,767
Why did Mr. Jeong Sang-hun consider
relocating the site for the new business?

824
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:07,478
Let's say you and Yeong-min
know each other well.

825
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:09,188
Let's be honest.

826
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:11,733
Do you think
that your husband is still alive?

827
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:16,029
Yeong-min, do you actually want Sang-hun
to come back alive?
