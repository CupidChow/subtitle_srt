1
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,375
THIS DRAMA IS A WORK OF FICTION.
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,

2
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:45,045
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGIONS, AND INCIDENTS
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:50,401
We've collected 95 percent

4
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:53,196
of the waste from Jeonggeon Steelwork.

5
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:56,032
Then is the RMC factory
the only one that's left now?

6
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:59,035
Yes. The factory was built on land

7
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,578
reclaimed from a lake,

8
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:04,666
so it's not easy to collect all the waste
buried underneath.

9
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:09,963
I heard some odd symptoms are starting
to arise among the residents in the area.

10
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:12,799
We'd need at least four years

11
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:14,217
for the bill to pass.

12
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,594
When will we draft the bill,
make sure it passes,

13
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:21,099
tear down the factory,
and dig that all up? Goodness.

14
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,184
We should rush things.

15
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:27,272
We just need to dig up what's buried
underneath Songju RMC.

16
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:29,023
Then we'll be able

17
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,860
to completely bury the truth.

18
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:42,996
Please do your best.

19
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,080
I'll make sure

20
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:48,126
all of you are well compensated
for your work.

21
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,656
REAL INTENTION

22
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:23,369
So you confirmed the water is contaminated
and hexavalent chromium is the cause,

23
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:27,290
but are you saying Songju RMC
didn't contaminate the water?

24
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,376
No, they didn't. I checked it
with the lab before coming here.

25
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:34,255
The contamination began
at least 20 years ago.

26
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:36,507
In other words,

27
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,678
the contamination started
even before they built Songju RMC.

28
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,263
MINING AND MANUFACTURING

29
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:46,643
These are companies that handled
hexavalent chromium 20 years ago.

30
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:49,562
There is only one company I suspect.

31
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:50,605
JEONGGEON STEELWORK

32
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:52,398
"Jeonggeon Steelwork."

33
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:53,691
JEONG YEONG-MUN

34
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:55,485
"Jeong Yeong-mun"?

35
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,862
Yes. JQ used to be Jeonggeon.

36
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:02,158
JQ first started
as a steelwork company in Songju

37
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,369
where the lot for the new business is.

38
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,247
When I assumed that Songju RMC
was the source of the contamination,

39
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:11,918
I thought that this all happened
because of money.

40
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,462
Once people found out
about the contamination,

41
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:15,838
the business would fall through

42
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:19,634
and all the investment they made
in Songju would come to nothing.

43
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,804
And the price of the land they bought
in Songju would plummet.

44
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:26,140
If that happened, JQ would probably
end up with astronomical losses.

45
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:27,475
But what if it was the opposite?

46
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:32,438
JQ started to cover
the patients' medical bills

47
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:36,025
even before the National Assembly
began talking about the new business.

48
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,779
Even before they tried
to set up the new business,

49
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:43,324
JQ was aware of the patients
and their conditions?

50
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:45,201
Yes.

51
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,329
Then, JQ and Hong Min-guk aren't

52
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,292
trying to cover up the contamination
for the sake of the new business.

53
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,753
To cover up the contamination,
they came up with the new business

54
00:04:57,922 --> 00:05:01,342
because they were the ones
who contaminated the land.

55
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:06,764
Detective Jo.

56
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:16,065
Kim Pil-yeon, Choi Chi-deuk,

57
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:18,026
Choe Su-hyeon,

58
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:20,194
Kim Seung-cheol,

59
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:21,863
and Jeong Sang-hun.

60
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,700
All of them knew
about the land being contaminated.

61
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:28,786
That's why they killed them.

62
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,081
Because they knew about the contamination.

63
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:38,713
JQ is launching a whole new business
just to cover up the contamination.

64
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:42,633
Do you think they'd let people
who know about it walk around freely?

65
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:44,927
Are you saying

66
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,765
JQ killed all of them?

67
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:50,767
My father-in-law killed them?

68
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:55,313
That can't be.

69
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,315
Gosh, that's insane.

70
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,193
How could he do that to Sang-hun?

71
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:11,746
What was that?

72
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:21,422
Captain, isn't that the vehicle
Jo Tae-sik is using?

73
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:23,674
-Follow the car.
-Okay.

74
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:33,935
Go faster.

75
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,813
-Beat that car.
-Yes, sir.

76
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,648
Hey, go faster.

77
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:42,652
Faster.

78
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:54,080
-Hey, the brakes.
-Yes, sir.

79
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,415
Turn the car around.

80
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:05,842
There.

81
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,343
-Turn right.
-Here?

82
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:08,553
-Turn right!
-Yes, sir.

83
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:27,989
Jo Tae-sik, get out!

84
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,534
Get out at once!

85
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,561
Where is Detective Jo Tae-sik?

86
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:01,022
Why are you asking me?

87
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:04,066
-Weren't you with him until just now?
-Me?

88
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,276
Were you not?

89
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,360
No, I wasn't.

90
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,405
Then why did you come out of the car?

91
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,991
Why did you go to the empty house?

92
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:15,328
I was looking for places
where Sang-hun might be.

93
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,331
No one seemed interested
in finding my husband

94
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,833
after what happened to Detective Jo,

95
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,127
so I was trying to find him on my own.

96
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,467
So you went there to find your husband

97
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,928
and took the car
Jo Tae-sik has been using?

98
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,057
Do you think that makes sense,
Assemblywoman Kim?

99
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:36,974
This car?

100
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,268
Is this Detective Jo's car?

101
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:42,897
My secretary said
he left the keys in the car,

102
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,441
so I thought this car was the one.

103
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,696
I had no idea. I'm sorry.

104
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,490
Assemblywoman Kim.

105
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,283
Stop speaking nonsense, please.

106
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,661
You met Tae-sik there, didn't you?

107
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:58,329
Did you meet him there every time?

108
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,623
What on earth are you talking about?

109
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,584
You chased me
and even pointed your gun at me.

110
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:05,962
At this rate,

111
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:09,966
you'll soon shoot innocent people
who did nothing wrong.

112
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:44,584
What on earth

113
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:46,961
are you talking about?

114
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:50,298
The reason you chose that location
for the new business.

115
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:53,009
I know everything.

116
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,013
You contaminated the land, Father.

117
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:00,808
That's why the people there are ill.

118
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:02,893
In case people find out,

119
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:06,230
you're trying to set up
the new business complex there.

120
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:09,525
I'm not following at all.
What kind of contamination?

121
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,571
I know nothing about it.

122
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:15,781
Jeonggeon Steelwork.

123
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:19,994
I looked into it myself.

124
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:24,999
A massive amount of hexavalent chromium
was found in the underground water there,

125
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,502
and the contamination began 20 years ago.

126
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:30,838
Back then in Songju, only your company

127
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:35,593
dealt with that much hexavalent chromium.

128
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:40,931
There seems to have been
a serious misunderstanding.

129
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,224
Then give me an explanation.

130
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:46,354
Why is JQ Hospital
taking care of those patients?

131
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,648
And why are you trying so hard
to buy that land?

132
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,776
Shall I give the answers for you?

133
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,779
Because those patients and the land

134
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,115
are evidence of the contamination.

135
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:02,912
You need to buy that land
and drive the patients out of there

136
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:06,332
in order to gain full control
over all the evidence.

137
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:08,834
That's why you plotted all of this.

138
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:12,546
You were the one behind

139
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,467
Choi Chi-deuk, In Dong-gu,
and even Mr. Hong.

140
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:19,470
You were the one who made me

141
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:22,932
an assemblywoman and forced
me to propose the bill, weren't you?

142
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:24,892
Stop talking utter nonsense.

143
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:27,895
Father, please stop lying to me.

144
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:30,815
Ms. Choe, Dad, and Sang-hun

145
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,859
all tried to reveal the truth.

146
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:36,695
That's why you got Mr. In
to do such things to them.

147
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:38,697
What?

148
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:43,494
Zero, one, four, zero, three, zero, three,
zero, three, zero, six.

149
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:46,247
Isn't that the message you sent?

150
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:49,917
Wasn't it a warning that I will die too

151
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,962
if I object to the new business?

152
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,463
What message?

153
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:57,049
What are you talking about?

154
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:01,178
Tell me everything.
What the heck are you talking about?

155
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:08,686
What was that about?

156
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,605
He seemed surprised
when I mentioned the message,

157
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:14,608
as if he had no idea about it.

158
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:17,319
No.

159
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,197
He's still lying about the contamination.

160
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,324
Everything's a lie.

161
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:41,635
Yeong-min?

162
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:55,983
Yeong-min, you said
you would take care of Seo-hui.

163
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:59,445
What the hell have you been doing?

164
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,780
I'm sorry, sir. Forgive me.

165
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:06,076
There's a bigger problem. Apparently,
the culprit sent Seo-hui a message

166
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,538
every time Sang-hun's body part turned up.

167
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:13,334
-Pardon?
-If what Seo-hui told me is true,

168
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,419
we've been fooled.

169
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:19,215
Who is doing this,
and what does this bastard want?

170
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,100
Mr. Lee.

171
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:32,686
We should hurry.

172
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:16,689
Is that Mr. Lee?

173
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,610
Doesn't he work for Father?

174
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,576
Aren't they JQ's directors?

175
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,915
Why are they gathered at this hour?

176
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:41,797
I heard from Mr. Park

177
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,299
that you, Mr. Jin,

178
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:47,094
are planning something very interesting.

179
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,430
I also heard you've been buying

180
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:51,849
the company's shares
behind Chairman Jeong's back.

181
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:55,477
And you keep organizing these meetings

182
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:59,189
with us unimportant old folks
who are now retired.

183
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:01,609
What on earth are you trying to do?

184
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,029
Just as you're speculating, sir.

185
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,782
-Are you--
-We won't have this opportunity again.

186
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:12,202
I'd like all of you to join hands with me.

187
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,545
Do you think Mr. Gong will side with us?

188
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:26,675
Even though he's a founding contributor,
he's only been managing the foundation

189
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,929
for the past seven years because
he got on the wrong side of the chairman.

190
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,222
He must be holding a deep grudge.

191
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:34,558
I'm sure he'll join hands with us.

192
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,769
We currently own 41 percent of the shares.

193
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:40,272
Combined with Mr. Gong's shares,
we have about 52 percent,

194
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,274
so it'll pass without any issues.

195
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,694
But will we be okay
until the general shareholders' meeting?

196
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:48,364
If Mr. In finds out--

197
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,990
That's why this is a golden opportunity.

198
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:51,700
At the moment,

199
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,578
Mr. In can't afford to worry about this.

200
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:57,331
What is he talking about?

201
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,801
Why didn't you pick up?
Did you lose your phone?

202
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,765
Jin-gyeong came by yesterday.
You got the clothes, right?

203
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:17,726
-Why did she come by?
-You sent her on an errand.

204
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,812
-She picked up your clothes and shoes.
-Shit.

205
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:22,064
What is it?
What are you looking for? Why...

206
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:24,817
Honey, where are you going?

207
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,946
Hey, find out where Jin-gyeong is.

208
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:31,490
Track her location or something!

209
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:42,167
Ma'am, we have the result.

210
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:44,461
I'll give it to her.

211
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,881
Do you have the result?

212
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,259
Tae-sik didn't do it. It's not him, right?

213
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:53,679
I'm sorry.

214
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:28,922
MOTEL

215
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,362
Get him!

216
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:54,573
Stop right there, you prick!

217
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:07,920
Stop, you bastard!

218
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,672
You'd better stop. Hey!

219
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:15,511
Detective Lee, go!

220
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:28,107
-You three, go that way.
-Okay.

221
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:29,858
Guys, hurry.

222
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:40,035
Over there!

223
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,079
-Okay, got it.
-Catch him.

224
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:31,920
Jo Tae-sik!

225
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:43,182
Enough.

226
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:54,860
Well done.

227
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,573
You're finally getting things
done properly.

228
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:06,163
Okay. I'll see you later, then.

229
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:18,217
You knew you'd get caught.
Why did you drag it out for so long?

230
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,595
Jo Tae-sik.

231
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:25,098
Do you admit to killing
Corporal Jeon Ho-gyu in the empty lot

232
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,684
near your place on May 8
at around 10 p.m.?

233
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,020
Do you

234
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:31,939
admit it?

235
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:37,694
We have the text you sent him that day,
the gun found at the scene,

236
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:41,240
and statements from the inspectors
who witnessed you fleeing the scene.

237
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,368
Admit it.

238
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:46,787
It doesn't matter what I say.

239
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:49,998
Isn't the answer already decided?

240
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:52,793
Do whatever you want.

241
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:54,378
But just know

242
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:57,339
I will never say

243
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:00,300
what you want me to say.

244
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:01,927
Do you know why?

245
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,180
Because I did not kill Ho-gyu.

246
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,432
Jo Tae-sik!

247
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:17,859
Weren't Father, Mr. In, and Yeong-min
on the same side?

248
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:21,947
Based on what he said at the hotel,
it didn't sound like they were.

249
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:24,283
It sounded like Yeong-min is trying

250
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,828
to use this opportunity
to gain control over the company.

251
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:32,457
And it doesn't seem to have anything
to do with Sang-hun either.

252
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:35,335
Gosh, what is going on?

253
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,756
DETECTIVE KANG JIN-GYEONG

254
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,885
-Hello, Detective Kang.
-Assemblywoman Kim.

255
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,765
Tae-sik got arrested.

256
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,352
He got arrested?

257
00:21:57,899 --> 00:22:00,360
-Then what should we do now?
-He is held in custody,

258
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:03,071
but there's a reason.

259
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,451
The thing is...

260
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:18,295
He's so stubborn. He's not even budging.

261
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:22,382
What should we do, sir?
He's been sitting like that for hours.

262
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:24,718
He won't last long.

263
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:36,063
We have evidence and witness statements,

264
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,024
so we can indict him
either today or tomorrow.

265
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:41,526
Isn't this enough?

266
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:44,404
Like you told me to do,

267
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,282
I framed Tae-sik for the murder
and got him arrested,

268
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:49,284
so can't this be over now?

269
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,286
You killed

270
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:54,122
Choe Su-hyeon and Kim Seung-cheol,

271
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,333
but I covered it up for you.

272
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,169
I dealt with Kim Pil-yeon
and Choi Chi-deuk

273
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:01,213
and even Kim Seo-hui's accident.

274
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:02,964
Because of you,

275
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,970
I even had to kill Ho-gyu.

276
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:12,432
And now I've arrested Tae-sik.

277
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:15,727
I've done enough.

278
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,940
Helping you kill people
and fabricating cases.

279
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:23,151
I'm done with all that.

280
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:26,863
So give the video back to me.

281
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,784
Stop cornering me.

282
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:35,413
Okay.

283
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:00,063
RECORDING

284
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:04,234
So this is why you were babbling so much.

285
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,364
You know what?

286
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:12,242
I hate it

287
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:17,080
when someone makes me say things twice.

288
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:22,043
I told you to take care of Jo Tae-sik.

289
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:24,462
Once you get rid of him,

290
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:30,093
I'll end things as you want.
Didn't I say that?

291
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,305
But why...

292
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:39,603
are you being like this?

293
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:46,109
Say something.

294
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:00,790
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

295
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:07,547
-Tae-sik.
-Hey.

296
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,300
TEST RESULT

297
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:13,845
Ho-gyu's blood was found
on Captain's shoe.

298
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:17,098
And the fabric found in his nails
matches his clothes.

299
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:18,600
We've finally got it.

300
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:20,769
You can prove your innocence with this.

301
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:22,354
And we can catch Captain Yu.

302
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:24,481
Let's go and get him.

303
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:26,816
Hey, wait.

304
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:29,069
If we catch Dae-yong now,

305
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:32,405
In Dong-gu will find it out immediately.
What do you think he'll do?

306
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:36,076
He'll put all the blame on Dae-yong
and leave the country.

307
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:37,619
Then...

308
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:41,039
Dae-yong will take all the blame,
and we'll lose the one behind him.

309
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:44,251
What do we do then?

310
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,211
He must've found out

311
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:49,881
that you took his clothes by now.

312
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:53,176
I should go and meet him first.

313
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,703
I guess you washed
your clothes to make sure.

314
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:23,373
But you didn't know Ho-gyu's blood
was on your shoe.

315
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:27,294
And the fiber found in Ho-gyu's nails

316
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:29,045
matches with the fiber from your clothes.

317
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,048
Jin-gyeong already went to the inspector

318
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:35,093
with the test results
and your phone location history.

319
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:36,594
With them,

320
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:39,973
she can prove that you were
with Ho-gyu before he died,

321
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:43,143
and you killed him after a tussle.

322
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:47,105
It's all over, Dae-yong.

323
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:50,525
It's over.

324
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:52,360
Then...

325
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:55,030
Why are you here?

326
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:58,825
Did you come here to tell me
to get ready to be arrested?

327
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,329
What is it you want?

328
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:04,998
Why did you not arrest me the other day?

329
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:07,042
-What?
-When I was put

330
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,836
on the wanted list and went to your place,
you could've caught me.

331
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:12,505
You could've killed me if you wanted.

332
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:16,384
You didn't mean

333
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,012
to kill Ho-gyu in the first place, right?

334
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:23,850
And you didn't mean to frame me.

335
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:27,937
If you did, you would've gone
with my gun in the first place.

336
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:30,940
But you stole my gun

337
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:33,902
after Ho-gyu died.

338
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:38,990
Dae-yong.

339
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:41,326
I know you too well.

340
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:45,038
What made you do all this?

341
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:49,918
What did In Dong-gu do
to make you be like this?

342
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,045
Why do you ask?

343
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:53,963
If you know,

344
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:57,300
will you kill In Dong-gu for me?

345
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:00,095
I can kill him.

346
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:02,931
I will kill him.

347
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:06,726
If that's the only way
you can be free from him,

348
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,729
I'll kill him for you.

349
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,191
So turn yourself in, Dae-yong.

350
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:17,070
Turn yourself in
and help us catch In Dong-gu.

351
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:21,366
That's the only way
you can pay for your sin.

352
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,454
The only way you can
be rid of In Dong-gu, that jerk.

353
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:29,749
Dae-yong.

354
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,978
Let go of him, you jerk!

355
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:33,354
Stop it, Dae-yong.

356
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,149
Don't do that.

357
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,067
Just don't!

358
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:40,987
Dae-yong, stop!

359
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:43,490
No, Dae-yong.

360
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:47,118
Hey.

361
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,165
What? Was it a gun?

362
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:54,083
Go. Start the car.

363
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,888
You're so done.

364
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,351
-In Dong-gu!
-It's not over.

365
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:12,769
Tae-sik.

366
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:14,938
Give me that.

367
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,025
In Dong-gu, let go of him
and raise your hands.

368
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:23,446
Hands up, you bastard!

369
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:39,420
Do you want me to make
In Dong-gu admit what he did?

370
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:41,422
Don't you know him?

371
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:44,634
I'm sure he'll sense it.

372
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:46,344
What if that's part of our plan?

373
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:52,183
This is where In Dong-gu
and Captain Yu are meeting.

374
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:55,812
Captain Yu will go to meet In Dong-gu
with a bug attached to his clothes.

375
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,022
We will stake out in the vicinity.

376
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,067
Once In Dong-gu says something crucial,

377
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:03,152
we will make a raid.

378
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:04,320
-Okay.
-Okay.

379
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:13,997
Tae-sik.

380
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,843
I told you to take care of Jo Tae-sik.

381
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:29,053
Once you get rid of him,

382
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:31,514
I'll end things as you want.

383
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:35,768
Didn't I say that?

384
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:41,900
In Dong-gu.

385
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,027
You are under arrest

386
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,613
for murdering

387
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:48,948
Choe Su-hyeon, Kim Seung-cheol,

388
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:51,367
Choi Chi-deuk, and Kim Pil-yeon.

389
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:59,208
You have the right to have an attorney

390
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,253
and explain yourself...

391
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,591
Forget it.

392
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:09,802
You know it too well.

393
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:13,056
You're a real professional.

394
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:14,933
Hey.

395
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:16,017
Here.

396
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:18,353
Take him.

397
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:35,703
Hey, Kang Jin-gyeong.

398
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:37,997
Go ahead and cuff me.

399
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:53,888
Let's go.

400
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:00,311
In this situation,

401
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:03,147
Mr. In isn't likely to be acquitted.

402
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,566
Commissioner-General Park.

403
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:07,652
Is there anything you can do?

404
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:09,153
I'm sorry, sir.

405
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:11,572
With the definite evidence they have,

406
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,534
there's no way we can cover it up.

407
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:19,122
Something's wrong.

408
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:22,542
Something has gone wrong.

409
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:26,754
If not, why do we keep
having problem after problem?

410
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:29,674
Sir, let's handle
the most urgent matter first.

411
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:32,468
There's nothing else we can do for now.

412
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:36,139
Let's cut him off.

413
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:44,939
When did it start?

414
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:48,609
When did you start getting

415
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:50,695
tangled up with In Dong-gu?

416
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:55,908
Min-cheol, are you really thinking of
reporting me to the prosecution?

417
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:58,703
You received bribes
and let them off the hook so many times.

418
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:00,747
Who do you think you are?

419
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:03,499
-What about you? Are your hands clean?
-Yes, my hands are clean.

420
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:05,418
An armed robbery has occurred
in Yangjae-dong.

421
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:07,962
The suspect is on the run. We need backup.

422
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,297
Aren't you going to get to work?

423
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,840
Damn it!

424
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:16,804
Drop the knife!

425
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:22,935
You bastard!

426
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:28,691
You asshole!

427
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:33,279
Dae-yong...

428
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:39,202
I was going to help him,

429
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:43,748
but somehow,
I couldn't take a step forward.

430
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:51,923
If he was gone...

431
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:54,425
If I overlooked it this once,

432
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,512
I thought everything would be okay.

433
00:34:58,763 --> 00:34:59,764
It's okay.

434
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:01,724
Dae-yong...

435
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:06,979
It's okay.

436
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,649
I was out of my mind.

437
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:21,285
It took me a lot of effort to find this.

438
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,872
-How...
-I won't be asking for much.

439
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:31,587
You just need to

440
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:34,090
forge a case for me.

441
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:40,471
You've been threatening
Captain Yu Dae-yong, using the murder

442
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:43,099
of Detective Park Min-cheol
that took place ten years ago.

443
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:47,728
On February 14, you went
to Choe Su-hyeon's house

444
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,814
and pushed her off the rooftop
using drugs.

445
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:51,774
Then you threatened Captain Yu

446
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:54,485
to make it look like a suicide.

447
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:56,612
Do you admit it?

448
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:01,033
What about the car accident
of Assemblyman Kim Seung-cheol?

449
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:05,663
It was your doing,

450
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:07,665
wasn't it?

451
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:26,911
Then...

452
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:31,332
is it you who scrapped
Kim Seung-cheol's car?

453
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,377
Did In Dong-gu make you do that?

454
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:40,591
Please leave.

455
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:47,723
What about Kim Pil-yeon's
and Choi Chi-deuk's death?

456
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:52,270
You contacted In Dong-gu
right before they died.

457
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:56,774
-Captain Yu.
-Yes?

458
00:37:56,857 --> 00:38:00,027
I guess Kim Seo-hui
is heading to Ansan Port now.

459
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:02,571
Are you sure?

460
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,156
-Yes.
-Okay.

461
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,037
Yes, Detective.

462
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:13,040
It seems Kim Seo-hui
is going to Ansan Port now.

463
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:30,433
I guess that jerk lied to us.

464
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:32,184
What about the hospital?

465
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:33,602
Do you know who are there?

466
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:35,229
I'll check it now.

467
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:39,317
MR. IN

468
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:43,946
CHOI CHI-DEUK IS ALONE IN HIS WARD

469
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:10,222
Is that right?

470
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:13,267
You got a tip-off from Detective Yu

471
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,852
and killed Kim Pil-yeon

472
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:16,645
and Choi Chi-deuk.

473
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:22,860
You should have ruined only your life.

474
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:27,156
Why did you get Dae-yong involved?

475
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,077
Why?

476
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:40,169
You knew what In Dong-gu
would do to those guys,

477
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:42,004
but you still helped them?

478
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,674
How could you...

479
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:03,776
How could...

480
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:08,072
How could you do that?

481
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:10,324
How could you go that far?

482
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,121
I had no choice.

483
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:18,040
I was in hell.

484
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:21,460
I had no choice but to follow his orders.

485
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:24,922
When I came to my senses,

486
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:28,634
I realized that I'd gone too far.

487
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:33,472
What you just said...

488
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:37,643
Can you tell the family of Detective Park

489
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:39,979
what you just told me?

490
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:46,485
What about to Choe Su-hyeon's parents,
Ms. Kim, and Ho-gyu?

491
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:48,946
Can you tell them?

492
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:55,286
Had you come forward ten years ago...

493
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:59,748
No, had you corrected this
when In Dong-gu started to have

494
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:04,378
control over you,
you wouldn't have come this far.

495
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:07,506
Why did you...

496
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:12,094
Why did you do that?

497
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:14,889
Why? Why did you?

498
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:19,518
You should have told me, at least.
You should've told me the truth!

499
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:23,814
Then I could've done something
before this happened! Damn it.

500
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:54,136
I gave some thought
to why you were committing

501
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:56,305
such awful crimes.

502
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:01,101
Contamination.

503
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:06,690
That's what all the victims you killed
had in common.

504
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:10,611
They all knew that the land
for the new business was contaminated.

505
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:14,823
Wait. I shouldn't count
Jeong Sang-hun as a victim.

506
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:16,408
Well, for now.

507
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:18,744
Is that why?

508
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:21,705
Is that why you killed them
under Chairman Jeong's order

509
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,290
to cover up what JQ did?

510
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:28,170
Chairman Jeong

511
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:31,340
has nothing to do with this.

512
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:37,263
Seeing how you're so loyal to him
even when you're about to go to jail,

513
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:41,433
I ought to praise your faithfulness.

514
00:42:42,768 --> 00:42:44,603
Chairman Jeong
didn't order you to do this,

515
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:47,314
but you did all those things on your own?
All of those crimes?

516
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:49,858
Are you some kind of psychopath?

517
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:56,115
Well, yes. I doubt that Chairman Jeong
ordered you to harm Jeong Sang-hun.

518
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:57,741
He even quashed the adoption documents

519
00:42:57,825 --> 00:43:00,160
to make it look like Jeong Sang-hun
is his real son.

520
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:02,538
Even if Jeong Sang-hun's behaviors
had displeased him,

521
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:05,708
he wouldn't have ordered you
to cut off his body parts.

522
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:08,002
That's a bit gruesome, right?

523
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,796
Did you have

524
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,591
a personal vendetta
against Jeong Sang-hun?

525
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:18,637
Because he had betrayed
Chairman Jeong whom you so loyally serve,

526
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:20,931
were you trying
to get back at him for that?

527
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:27,021
Where is Jeong Sang-hun?

528
00:43:28,647 --> 00:43:29,857
Where is he?

529
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:36,822
NO CALLER ID

530
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:44,788
Hello?

531
00:43:47,082 --> 00:43:48,208
Hello.

532
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:50,461
Talk.

533
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:51,795
Seo-hui.

534
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:54,923
Seo-hui, it's me.

535
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:58,260
Sang-hun?

536
00:43:58,719 --> 00:43:59,720
Yes.

537
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:02,264
Is that you, Sang-hun?

538
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:04,892
Yes, it's me.

539
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:09,188
Sang-hun.

540
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:12,775
Sang-hun.

541
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:15,277
Sang-hun, where are you now?

542
00:44:17,863 --> 00:44:19,114
Sang-hun.

543
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:21,200
Hello?

544
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:22,660
Are you all right?

545
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:24,912
Are you well?

546
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:29,375
It's not the time to worry about me now.

547
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:31,168
Where are you, Sang-hun?

548
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:33,962
Sang-hun, tell me where you are.

549
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:36,799
I'll go there now.
Please tell me where you are.

550
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:39,468
Hello?

551
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:42,763
Hello.

552
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:46,058
Sang-hun.

553
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:50,020
Sang-hun.

554
00:44:51,563 --> 00:44:53,273
Hello? Sang-hun.

555
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:56,318
Hello? Sang-hun.

556
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:57,736
Ms. Kim.

557
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:01,615
Who are you?

558
00:45:08,705 --> 00:45:09,706
Where is

559
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:11,875
Jeong Sang-hun?

560
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:15,587
Where is he?

561
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:17,256
I don't know.

562
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:18,424
Hey.

563
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:22,136
I do not know.

564
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:25,139
I didn't abduct him.

565
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,724
You bastard.

566
00:45:29,726 --> 00:45:30,936
My answer back then

567
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:33,272
and my answer now

568
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:36,108
are the same.

569
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:40,320
I did not harm

570
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:42,698
Mr. Jeong Sang-hun.

571
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,667
Tae-sik, do you believe him?

572
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:57,880
All the victims we have
were murdered by that bastard.

573
00:45:58,046 --> 00:46:00,716
When you found that out,
he even tried to kill you.

574
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:03,093
That's why this is even stranger.

575
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,388
Why is he denying his charge
regarding Jeong Sang-hun?

576
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:08,974
Do you think he could be sending
signals to Chairman Jeong?

577
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:11,185
It could mean if the chairman doesn't

578
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:13,645
get him out of here,
he'll never tell where Jeong Sang-hun is.

579
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:15,939
Do you think
that's what he's trying to do?

580
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:27,201
Yes.

581
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:28,994
Sang-hun...

582
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:33,916
Sang-hun is still alive.

583
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:47,054
Hey.

584
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:49,515
Where is Dong-gu?

585
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:51,391
Answer me.

586
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:53,936
Hey, I'm his father.

587
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,813
His father wants to see his son
before going to sleep.

588
00:46:57,189 --> 00:47:00,192
Who are you to stop me from seeing him?

589
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:04,780
Dong-gu!

590
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:09,910
Dong-gu!

591
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:12,871
Your dad is here.

592
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:15,707
-Don't look at me, Mom.
-Dong-gu!

593
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:18,961
-Don't look at me, Mom.
-Your dad is here.

594
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:26,760
-I'm sorry.
-Come on.

595
00:47:26,843 --> 00:47:28,762
Cars get scratched when you drive.

596
00:47:28,845 --> 00:47:31,515
It's all right. Just be careful next time.

597
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:33,267
-Yes, sir.
-Sang-hun.

598
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:34,768
Your dad is home.

599
00:47:34,851 --> 00:47:35,978
Your dad is home.

600
00:47:36,061 --> 00:47:37,813
-Go to your dad.
-Sang-hun.

601
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:39,982
-Oh, dear.
-Let me see you.

602
00:47:40,065 --> 00:47:41,608
-Goodness.
-Let me see.

603
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,151
Are you that happy?

604
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:45,237
All right.

605
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:51,034
JQ SHOULD APOLOGIZE
FOR ABUSING SUBCONTRACTORS

606
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:58,458
You son of bitch, Jeong Yeong-mun.

607
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:03,463
-Move back.
-What are you doing?

608
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:05,132
Let go. Let go of me!

609
00:48:05,632 --> 00:48:07,175
JQ must apologize!

610
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:09,344
Let go of me. Let go!

611
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,888
JQ must apologize!

612
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:20,647
Your name is In Dong-gu, isn't it?

613
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:24,526
Yes, sir.

614
00:48:24,776 --> 00:48:27,529
Everyone has their rightful place.

615
00:48:27,904 --> 00:48:29,615
I'm saying this

616
00:48:29,948 --> 00:48:32,451
because I think you could be
more than a mere bodyguard.

617
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:42,753
Get in.

618
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:45,047
Let's talk on my way up.

619
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:54,222
Well, is your hand okay?

620
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:56,141
Yes, sir.

621
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:15,744
Mr. In.

622
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:19,081
Your attorney is here to see you.

623
00:49:26,588 --> 00:49:29,508
What did Chairman Jeong say?

624
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:33,303
He's very worried about you.

625
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,764
He said there's a tough road ahead of you.

626
00:49:36,598 --> 00:49:40,060
He also said that he trusts you

627
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:44,022
to endure the hardship that lies ahead.

628
00:49:47,984 --> 00:49:49,069
Mr. Lee.

629
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:54,700
Could you do me a favor?

630
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:05,502
I was trying to save it,

631
00:50:06,878 --> 00:50:08,880
but look at what's happened.

632
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:12,801
Sir, Mr. Lee is calling you.

633
00:50:13,009 --> 00:50:15,512
Mr. In wishes to speak to you
on the phone.

634
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:45,751
You got a call from him?

635
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:47,127
Your face...

636
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:48,545
It's nothing.

637
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:50,255
Go on. He called you?

638
00:50:52,841 --> 00:50:53,842
Just now...

639
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:56,261
I talked to Sang-hun just now.

640
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:59,431
It was definitely Sang-hun's voice.

641
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:01,892
He's still alive.

642
00:51:07,981 --> 00:51:10,066
In Dong-gu has been arrested,

643
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:12,360
but the culprit called you.

644
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:14,529
How does this make sense?

645
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:15,781
I'm sure of it.

646
00:51:15,947 --> 00:51:18,742
When the culprit let me talk to Sang-hun,

647
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:21,953
the culprit said something odd to me.

648
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:23,872
What?

649
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:27,292
Hello? Sang-hun.

650
00:51:28,084 --> 00:51:30,337
Hello? Sang-hun.

651
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:32,339
Ms. Kim.

652
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:35,675
Who are you?

653
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:38,887
Now, you've found out
everything you need to.

654
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:41,431
It's time to stop the new business.

655
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:43,225
What?

656
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:45,310
What do you mean?

657
00:51:45,852 --> 00:51:49,189
You wanted me to propose the bill to push
the new business forward, didn't you?

658
00:51:49,397 --> 00:51:50,857
What the heck are you saying?

659
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:52,734
Put Sang-hun on the phone.

660
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:54,277
Put him on the phone!

661
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:56,655
Ms. Kim. Stop the new business
from taking place.

662
00:51:56,738 --> 00:51:58,490
Put Sang-hun on the phone!

663
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:03,745
No. No, Sang-hun.

664
00:52:11,753 --> 00:52:13,380
"Stop the new business"?

665
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:16,591
-That's what the culprit said?
-Yes.

666
00:52:17,175 --> 00:52:18,343
Why all of a sudden?

667
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:21,012
The culprit made you propose
the bill for it.

668
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:22,848
I don't understand that part, either.

669
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:27,519
He told me that since I've found out
everything I need to,

670
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:30,146
it's time for me to stop the new business.

671
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:31,815
"Everything you need to"?

672
00:52:33,024 --> 00:52:34,776
Did he mean the contamination?

673
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:38,989
Wait. Does this mean the culprit
wanted you to find out the truth

674
00:52:39,072 --> 00:52:41,408
about the land for the new business?

675
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,410
But something doesn't add up.

676
00:52:44,035 --> 00:52:45,287
To cover up

677
00:52:45,745 --> 00:52:47,205
the contamination,

678
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:50,041
JQ killed people who were trying
to expose the truth

679
00:52:50,792 --> 00:52:53,545
and kidnapped Sang-hun to blackmail me.

680
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:56,047
Then, why do they want me
to find out the truth?

681
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:57,299
Right.

682
00:52:57,674 --> 00:53:00,302
They've tried so hard
to cover up the truth.

683
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:02,429
Why now?

684
00:53:03,138 --> 00:53:05,056
Cover it up, or expose it.

685
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:07,350
The agendas are contrary.

686
00:53:09,102 --> 00:53:10,270
My answer back then

687
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:12,522
and my answer now

688
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:15,233
are the same.

689
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:17,944
I did not harm

690
00:53:19,112 --> 00:53:20,322
Mr. Jeong Sang-hun.

691
00:53:22,407 --> 00:53:23,950
If what he said is true...

692
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:26,202
What is it?

693
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:29,956
If...

694
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:32,792
What if

695
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:34,461
there are

696
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,172
two culprits?

697
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:39,090
Pardon?

698
00:53:39,507 --> 00:53:40,675
I know for sure In Dong-gu

699
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:43,386
killed Choe Su-hyeon, your father,
Kim Pil-yeon, and Choi Chi-deuk.

700
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:45,513
Dae-yong also testified to that,

701
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:46,932
and we found evidence as well.

702
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:50,352
Something bothered me
when I was interrogating In Dong-gu.

703
00:53:50,518 --> 00:53:52,896
He refused to answer
every other question I asked him.

704
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:55,690
But when I asked about Jeong Sang-hun,

705
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:58,234
he answered me
and said it wasn't his doing.

706
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:03,406
What message?

707
00:54:04,115 --> 00:54:05,200
What are you talking about?

708
00:54:05,283 --> 00:54:07,494
What on earth do you mean by that?

709
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:09,996
Wasn't it a warning that I will die too

710
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:12,082
if I object to the new business?

711
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:13,750
Tell me everything.

712
00:54:13,833 --> 00:54:15,669
What the heck are you talking about?

713
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,254
Father, too.

714
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:21,341
It was the same way with Father.

715
00:54:22,008 --> 00:54:24,094
When I asked him about the contamination,

716
00:54:24,177 --> 00:54:26,680
he really acted as if he had no idea
about the blackmail message

717
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:28,765
I received.

718
00:54:30,308 --> 00:54:32,602
It seemed as if it was
his first time hearing about it.

719
00:54:33,269 --> 00:54:35,939
When he behaved that way,
I just thought he was lying to me.

720
00:54:37,023 --> 00:54:39,275
What if he wasn't faking it?

721
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:41,152
Even Chairman Jeong didn't know about it?

722
00:54:42,696 --> 00:54:45,156
Killing these four victims,
Choe Su-hyeon, your father,

723
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,700
Kim Pil-yeon, and Choi Chi-deuk suits

724
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:50,662
Chairman Jeong and In Dong-gu's agenda.
They are covering up the contamination.

725
00:54:51,579 --> 00:54:53,581
But kidnapping your husband,

726
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:55,834
cutting off his body parts
to let the world know,

727
00:54:56,334 --> 00:54:58,670
sending you the message with 0214 on it

728
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,922
to reveal the truth
behind Choe Su-hyeon's death,

729
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:03,967
and calling you to stop
the new business from taking place.

730
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:05,510
The agendas aren't the same.

731
00:55:05,593 --> 00:55:08,638
They are not covering it up.
They're actually exposing the truth

732
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:11,349
about the contamination caused by JQ.

733
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:17,313
The culprit who kidnapped your husband
and cut off his body parts to threaten you

734
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:19,607
isn't In Dong-gu.

735
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:21,860
It's someone else.

736
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:43,006
Then, who on earth kidnapped

737
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:45,759
Sang-hun?

738
00:55:47,635 --> 00:55:50,346
If the culprit's agenda
was to stop the new business,

739
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:52,932
why did the culprit tell me
to become an assemblywoman

740
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:54,684
and propose the bill for the new business?

741
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:57,020
Think about it.

742
00:55:57,854 --> 00:55:59,647
Ever since getting the blackmail message,

743
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:01,733
whom did you start to suspect?

744
00:56:03,276 --> 00:56:04,694
Mr. Hong and Mr. In.

745
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:08,448
What if that was
also part of the culprit's plan?

746
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:11,284
When you started to take an interest

747
00:56:11,367 --> 00:56:12,869
in the new business and suspect JQ,

748
00:56:12,952 --> 00:56:16,247
we ended up finding out
about the contamination.

749
00:56:17,373 --> 00:56:18,416
Are you saying the culprit

750
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:22,087
wanted to guide us to the truth

751
00:56:22,587 --> 00:56:24,756
and that's why the culprit sent
the message on purpose?

752
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:30,386
Who on earth could it be?

753
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:32,347
It's probably one of the people

754
00:56:32,972 --> 00:56:35,642
who knew about the contamination

755
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:38,686
and what Choe Su-hyeon, your father,
and your husband

756
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:39,813
were trying to do.

757
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:43,733
But the culprit

758
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:47,821
wouldn't face any responsibility
even if the truth was revealed.

759
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:51,741
When people found out
that Jeonggeon Steelwork caused it,

760
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:54,160
Chairman Jeong won't be able
to avoid taking responsibility.

761
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:57,664
And the Liberal Democratic Party will lose
the election as they sided with him.

762
00:56:58,456 --> 00:57:02,043
Hong Min-guk's road to becoming
the President would be disrupted.

763
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:05,755
As for In Dong-gu,
all of his murders will be revealed.

764
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:08,550
And that only leaves...

765
00:57:10,468 --> 00:57:13,888
He had a personal vendetta
against JQ and wanted

766
00:57:15,473 --> 00:57:17,767
Jeong Sang-hun to disappear
at the same time.

767
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:19,644
And

768
00:57:20,645 --> 00:57:23,314
he's trying to take over the company
by driving out

769
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:25,984
Father and In Dong-gu.

770
00:57:27,235 --> 00:57:29,446
To ensure you are not concerned,

771
00:57:30,071 --> 00:57:32,740
In Dong Gu, the Strategic Planning
Department Director,

772
00:57:33,074 --> 00:57:34,868
won't be resuming his position
anytime soon.

773
00:57:36,744 --> 00:57:38,079
There's only one man left.

774
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:41,541
Chairman Jeong Yeong-mun.

775
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:47,714
Let's turn it around.

776
00:57:51,342 --> 00:57:52,427
Let's turn the table around.

777
00:58:00,518 --> 00:58:01,811
That leaves only one person.

778
00:58:27,545 --> 00:58:29,047
Let me ask you one question.

779
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:32,425
If he was also looking for Jeong Sang-hun,

780
00:58:33,301 --> 00:58:34,552
whom was he suspecting?

781
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:37,722
Sang-hun is alive.

782
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:39,516
You know that, too.

783
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:41,684
You're just like Father.

784
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:44,229
You sacrificed Sang-hun
to take Father's position.

785
00:58:44,312 --> 00:58:45,688
Didn't you say you'll do everything

786
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:47,607
to save Sang-hun?

787
00:58:48,107 --> 00:58:49,817
I'm planning to hold a press conference.

788
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:51,611
I'll disclose this to the public.

789
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:53,655
It's about Seo-hui.

790
00:58:53,738 --> 00:58:56,366
Is she still useful to us?

791
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:02,622
Unless he went there to meet with someone,
his route doesn't make sense.

792
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:04,624
Don't let your guard down,
and keep an eye on him.

793
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:06,417
He'll try to find an opportunity

794
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:07,961
to make his comeback

795
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:10,547
as Sang-hun's seat is vacant for now.

796
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:13,258
I doubt that bastard will
kill Jeong Sang-hun.

797
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:14,717
No, he's more than capable.

798
00:59:15,301 --> 00:59:17,345
Why are you running
a background check on this guy?

799
00:59:18,346 --> 00:59:20,056
Once he found out the truth,

800
00:59:20,139 --> 00:59:22,016
he would have
the biggest vendetta against JQ.

801
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:24,978
It's him. He was the accomplice.

802
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:28,982
