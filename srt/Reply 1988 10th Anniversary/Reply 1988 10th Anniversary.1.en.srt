1
00:00:23,474 --> 00:00:26,944
"Reply 1988" began airing in the fall of 2015.

2
00:00:27,304 --> 00:00:29,614
With the heartwarming episodes,

3
00:00:29,644 --> 00:00:31,984
the drama filled our winter.

4
00:00:32,284 --> 00:00:34,784
Perhaps you don't remember much because ten years have passed.

5
00:00:35,084 --> 00:00:38,454
Then I'll go back to the time period in the drama...

6
00:00:38,484 --> 00:00:40,684
and introduce the Ssangmun-dong families.

7
00:00:40,824 --> 00:00:43,224
Hello, I'm Sung Deok Sun.

8
00:00:43,494 --> 00:00:46,023
I live in Bonghwangdang Alley, Ssangmun-dong,

9
00:00:46,024 --> 00:00:48,064
Dobong-gu, Seoul.

10
00:00:48,334 --> 00:00:50,694
This alley is a bit important to me.

11
00:00:51,334 --> 00:00:54,333
It's because the five friends I've spent my youth with...

12
00:00:54,334 --> 00:00:56,134
and their families live here.

13
00:00:56,634 --> 00:00:58,974
When something good happens, we laugh together.

14
00:00:59,144 --> 00:01:01,914
When something bad happens, we cry and console each other.

15
00:01:02,044 --> 00:01:04,044
When there's tasty food, we share it.

16
00:01:04,274 --> 00:01:06,984
Even when a physical fight occurs, we turn around and make up.

17
00:01:07,544 --> 00:01:10,414
Five families, who cherish and love each other more than anyone,

18
00:01:10,454 --> 00:01:12,454
live together in this alley.

19
00:01:13,054 --> 00:01:14,823
Firstly, my family...

20
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:17,994
lost its entire fortune when Dad stood surety for someone.

21
00:01:18,064 --> 00:01:20,293
We're renting a semi-basement room in Jung Hwan's house.

22
00:01:20,294 --> 00:01:21,893
My dad, Dong Il, has always been...

23
00:01:21,894 --> 00:01:23,763
- Hanil Bank's associate manager.
- Hey!

24
00:01:23,764 --> 00:01:25,263
My mom, Il Hwa,

25
00:01:25,264 --> 00:01:27,033
- cooks food in bulk.
- Come and eat!

26
00:01:27,034 --> 00:01:28,873
Then there are my older sister, who has the biggest power...

27
00:01:28,874 --> 00:01:30,273
- in the family, Bo Ra, - Hey, Sung Deok Sun!

28
00:01:30,274 --> 00:01:32,243
and my younger brother, who is the youngest in the trio,

29
00:01:32,244 --> 00:01:33,773
despite looking like he's 40 years old,

30
00:01:33,774 --> 00:01:35,113
- No Eul.
- Bo Ra.

31
00:01:35,114 --> 00:01:37,343
I'm the childish second daughter...

32
00:01:37,344 --> 00:01:40,013
with many interests and big dreams, Deok Sun.

33
00:01:40,014 --> 00:01:41,183
That makes up my family.

34
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:43,484
- Hey, come here!
- Hey!

35
00:01:44,154 --> 00:01:46,283
Jung Hwan's family turned over a new leaf...

36
00:01:46,284 --> 00:01:47,753
when Jung Bong won the lottery.

37
00:01:47,754 --> 00:01:49,423
Now, they're the richest family in Ssangmun-dong...

38
00:01:49,424 --> 00:01:51,424
that lives in a two-storey, Western-style house.

39
00:01:51,764 --> 00:01:52,923
My comedy partner,

40
00:01:52,924 --> 00:01:54,463
- Uncle Sung Kyun...
- Long life!

41
00:01:54,464 --> 00:01:56,363
and Ms. Cheetah,

42
00:01:56,364 --> 00:01:57,693
- Aunt Mi Ran.
- You said you'd eat outside!

43
00:01:57,694 --> 00:01:58,733
Jung Bong has studied for CSAT for six years.

44
00:01:58,734 --> 00:01:59,763
Mother.

45
00:01:59,764 --> 00:02:01,503
Jung Hwan seems cold and aloof, but he's a softie...

46
00:02:01,504 --> 00:02:02,973
- who does everything for me.
- What's up?

47
00:02:02,974 --> 00:02:05,703
I can't forget to mention Mi Ok, my best friend...

48
00:02:05,704 --> 00:02:07,873
who fell in love with Jung Bong.

49
00:02:07,874 --> 00:02:08,874
Confirmation.

50
00:02:12,144 --> 00:02:14,814
I'll introduce the remaining three families at once.

51
00:02:15,784 --> 00:02:17,513
Dong Ryong, who loves dance,

52
00:02:17,514 --> 00:02:19,653
lives with his dad, Uncle Jae Myung.

53
00:02:19,654 --> 00:02:21,123
My dad is a supervisor

54
00:02:21,124 --> 00:02:23,923
Aunt Sun Young raises two children by herself.

55
00:02:23,924 --> 00:02:25,764
There are Sun Woo, who has matured early on,

56
00:02:25,824 --> 00:02:29,194
and Jin Ju, who is the most popular star in the alley.

57
00:02:29,234 --> 00:02:31,633
They're well-known to be a loving family in Ssangmun-dong.

58
00:02:31,634 --> 00:02:32,634
Yeong Gu isn't here.

59
00:02:32,635 --> 00:02:34,734
Lastly, there are Taek, a genius go player, who is...

60
00:02:34,804 --> 00:02:36,473
- the pride of Ssangmun-dong, - Deok Sun.

61
00:02:36,474 --> 00:02:38,704
and Uncle Moo Sung, who runs Bonghwangdang.

62
00:02:38,944 --> 00:02:40,903
Let me tell you something that isn't exactly a secret.

63
00:02:40,904 --> 00:02:43,573
Sun Woo and Taek become a family in the end.

64
00:02:43,574 --> 00:02:46,084
It's cold. How about we live together?

65
00:02:47,044 --> 00:02:49,914
Back then, we were the most pure and passionate.

66
00:02:50,454 --> 00:02:53,924
The five families that kept the alley noisy in Ssangmun-dong...

67
00:02:54,024 --> 00:02:56,854
reunited in the fall of 2025.

68
00:02:57,124 --> 00:02:59,193
To the reunion after ten years,

69
00:02:59,194 --> 00:03:01,233
we invite everyone...

70
00:03:01,234 --> 00:03:02,934
who has loved "Reply 1988."

71
00:03:03,564 --> 00:03:06,134
Now, let's begin.

72
00:03:06,234 --> 00:03:12,574
(October 2025, Gapyeong-gun, Gyeonggi Province)

73
00:03:13,074 --> 00:03:18,114
(A family gathers in a cafe in Gapyeong.)

74
00:03:19,744 --> 00:03:22,214
(This is the first family.)

75
00:03:22,584 --> 00:03:25,053
I haven't filmed your entrance yet.

76
00:03:25,054 --> 00:03:26,153
Other cameramen filmed it.

77
00:03:26,154 --> 00:03:27,853
No, they didn't. Walk over here one more time.

78
00:03:27,854 --> 00:03:28,953
For goodness' sake.

79
00:03:28,954 --> 00:03:30,253
Hey, since it has been a while...

80
00:03:30,254 --> 00:03:31,323
What? Hey.

81
00:03:31,324 --> 00:03:33,123
- Film him first.
- It'll take forever.

82
00:03:33,124 --> 00:03:35,694
He'll go home soon.

83
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,593
- Let's film him.
- It's autumn.

84
00:03:37,594 --> 00:03:38,964
It's autumn.

85
00:03:39,404 --> 00:03:40,704
Will you film me using a helicam?

86
00:03:40,764 --> 00:03:41,874
Send it up.

87
00:03:43,234 --> 00:03:45,244
In 1, 2, 3.

88
00:03:47,204 --> 00:03:48,944
My goodness.

89
00:03:49,414 --> 00:03:51,614
We're meeting at a very nice place.

90
00:03:53,214 --> 00:03:54,214
(Sung Dong Il playing Sung Dong Il)

91
00:03:54,215 --> 00:03:55,714
Autumn is here.

92
00:04:02,824 --> 00:04:04,093
Hello.

93
00:04:04,094 --> 00:04:05,564
(Hye Ri playing Sung Deok Sun)

94
00:04:11,434 --> 00:04:13,633
(Lee II Hwa playing Lee II Hwa)

95
00:04:13,634 --> 00:04:14,804
How pretty.

96
00:04:17,074 --> 00:04:19,004
- Let's go inside.
- Let's go inside.

97
00:04:20,904 --> 00:04:22,713
- I think I heard Dad's voice.
- Really?

98
00:04:22,714 --> 00:04:23,814
(Choi Sung Won playing Sung No Eul, Ryu Hye Young playing Sung Bo Ra)

99
00:04:24,644 --> 00:04:26,143
Should we keep our shoes on?

100
00:04:26,144 --> 00:04:27,244
We should keep our shoes on.

101
00:04:28,654 --> 00:04:29,854
My goodness.

102
00:04:30,584 --> 00:04:32,453
Hello.

103
00:04:32,454 --> 00:04:36,324
(Dad, Mom, and the three siblings)

104
00:04:37,294 --> 00:04:39,223
- Someone is here. Hello.
- We need to keep our shoes on.

105
00:04:39,224 --> 00:04:41,063
- Who is it?
- Hello. It's this way.

106
00:04:41,064 --> 00:04:42,233
Hello.

107
00:04:42,234 --> 00:04:44,194
- Hello.
- Hello.

108
00:04:44,234 --> 00:04:45,503
- Hello.
- What a fake girl.

109
00:04:45,504 --> 00:04:46,964
Hello.

110
00:04:47,064 --> 00:04:48,833
- Hello.
- Give me a break.

111
00:04:48,834 --> 00:04:50,304
(They bicker as soon as they see each other.)

112
00:04:50,774 --> 00:04:52,174
(Giggling)

113
00:04:52,644 --> 00:04:54,143
Happy New Year.

114
00:04:54,144 --> 00:04:55,273
- What?
- It isn't the new year.

115
00:04:55,274 --> 00:04:56,444
(Last week was Chuseok.)

116
00:04:56,814 --> 00:04:58,344
You're still all over the place.

117
00:04:59,144 --> 00:05:00,883
- You still haven't gotten a grip.
- I want a sip.

118
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:03,284
- No. Dad's spit got in.
- Why not?

119
00:05:03,414 --> 00:05:05,223
Hello.

120
00:05:05,224 --> 00:05:06,283
- Hello.
- What is it?

121
00:05:06,284 --> 00:05:07,583
(People come in one at a time as the dad and daughter bicker.)

122
00:05:07,584 --> 00:05:08,593
- Hi.
- Hurry up.

123
00:05:08,594 --> 00:05:09,653
There they are.

124
00:05:09,654 --> 00:05:10,654
- Hi.
- Come on in.

125
00:05:10,655 --> 00:05:12,223
- My son and daughters.
- You guys brought many things.

126
00:05:12,224 --> 00:05:14,163
- "My son and daughters." - My son and daughters.

127
00:05:14,164 --> 00:05:16,293
- Mom.
- Hello.

128
00:05:16,294 --> 00:05:18,004
My goodness.

129
00:05:18,064 --> 00:05:19,563
- Hurry up.
- You became prettier.

130
00:05:19,564 --> 00:05:20,664
- Yes.
- Dad.

131
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:23,204
You guys never keep in touch. Hurry up and sit down.

132
00:05:24,034 --> 00:05:25,504
You guys never keep in touch.

133
00:05:25,744 --> 00:05:27,574
- We're beginning to get scolded.
- Here.

134
00:05:27,674 --> 00:05:30,043
- The outfits seem to be...
- Have you been well?

135
00:05:30,044 --> 00:05:31,983
from that time period.

136
00:05:31,984 --> 00:05:34,854
The head of the wardrobe team for the drama...

137
00:05:35,014 --> 00:05:37,713
prepared these outfits.

138
00:05:37,714 --> 00:05:39,184
- I knew it.
- Yes.

139
00:05:39,324 --> 00:05:41,053
I'm so happy to see you guys.

140
00:05:41,054 --> 00:05:43,053
This show will bring back...

141
00:05:43,054 --> 00:05:45,223
the good memories of "Reply 1988" for the viewers.

142
00:05:45,224 --> 00:05:46,724
They'll be very happy.

143
00:05:46,824 --> 00:05:50,134
For Reply 1988 10th Anniversary,

144
00:05:50,334 --> 00:05:51,934
we're having the opening at three locations.

145
00:05:52,234 --> 00:05:53,503
(That means...)

146
00:05:53,504 --> 00:05:54,773
Not just our family?

147
00:05:54,774 --> 00:05:58,803
(different families are gathered...)

148
00:05:58,804 --> 00:06:04,044
(at different locations.)

149
00:06:04,414 --> 00:06:08,214
(They'll be revealed soon.)

150
00:06:09,054 --> 00:06:11,923
How did the talk of the retreat start?

151
00:06:11,924 --> 00:06:14,554
You suddenly began to say that you needed a retreat.

152
00:06:14,754 --> 00:06:16,353
The older members gathered around.

153
00:06:16,354 --> 00:06:18,093
- Just the older members?
- Yes, just the older members.

154
00:06:18,094 --> 00:06:20,893
We talked all night long during a two-day trip.

155
00:06:20,894 --> 00:06:23,093
We talked about the past and shared how we've lived.

156
00:06:23,094 --> 00:06:25,864
The two-day trip was so much fun.

157
00:06:26,204 --> 00:06:28,133
(June 2025, the older members' meeting)

158
00:06:28,134 --> 00:06:29,973
- "Reply 1988." - Has it been 10 years already?

159
00:06:29,974 --> 00:06:31,743
- It'll be ten years in November.
- Ten years.

160
00:06:31,744 --> 00:06:33,073
- Ten years? My goodness.
- It has been ten years.

161
00:06:33,074 --> 00:06:34,744
It has already been ten years.

162
00:06:35,114 --> 00:06:37,374
That's right. We should do something as a team.

163
00:06:37,474 --> 00:06:39,613
- We should do that.
- We should have a retreat.

164
00:06:39,614 --> 00:06:41,354
- That's right. Let's do that.
- That sounds good.

165
00:06:41,414 --> 00:06:44,654
(A few days later, it leads to a younger members' meeting.)

166
00:06:45,024 --> 00:06:46,854
(2 weeks later, the younger members' meeting)

167
00:06:47,024 --> 00:06:48,893
In September or October,

168
00:06:48,894 --> 00:06:51,723
we'll gather everyone around for a two-day retreat...

169
00:06:51,724 --> 00:06:53,224
- or something.
- That sounds great.

170
00:06:53,394 --> 00:06:54,663
- With all the seniors?
- A two-day retreat.

171
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,464
- That's right.
- That sounds fun.

172
00:06:56,734 --> 00:06:58,164
- It's exciting.
- Yes.

173
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:00,834
(Everyone was for the idea.)

174
00:07:01,064 --> 00:07:03,133
Let's keep it simple and go...

175
00:07:03,134 --> 00:07:05,143
- to Switzerland or Hawaii.
- Okay.

176
00:07:05,144 --> 00:07:08,044
(The location became Gangwon Province.)

177
00:07:08,874 --> 00:07:12,043
"Dong Il, it was so much fun. Let's gather around again."

178
00:07:12,044 --> 00:07:14,013
"Let's do that." That talk developed...

179
00:07:14,014 --> 00:07:15,353
and led to this.

180
00:07:15,354 --> 00:07:17,014
It snowballed.

181
00:07:17,084 --> 00:07:19,683
The younger members heard the news...

182
00:07:19,684 --> 00:07:21,924
- and said, "Let's do the same." - Yes.

183
00:07:22,054 --> 00:07:23,953
- Then came the tenth anniversary.
- The world has changed,

184
00:07:23,954 --> 00:07:25,423
but I don't drink with children.

185
00:07:25,424 --> 00:07:26,863
(He's a cutie.)

186
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:29,133
Thanks to that,

187
00:07:29,134 --> 00:07:30,994
I'm seeing Sung Won and everyone.

188
00:07:31,064 --> 00:07:32,364
It's nice.

189
00:07:33,034 --> 00:07:34,733
Let me ask you this.

190
00:07:34,734 --> 00:07:36,533
Among your 2 daughters and 1 son,

191
00:07:36,534 --> 00:07:39,774
who kept in touch once in a while?

192
00:07:39,844 --> 00:07:41,614
Honestly speaking,

193
00:07:42,714 --> 00:07:44,674
- no one.
- I kept in touch.

194
00:07:45,014 --> 00:07:48,154
Honey, you kept in touch because you needed living expenses.

195
00:07:48,514 --> 00:07:51,983
But keeping in touch isn't what's important.

196
00:07:51,984 --> 00:07:53,584
It's best...

197
00:07:53,684 --> 00:07:55,994
to see them work diligently...

198
00:07:56,554 --> 00:07:58,893
- in their respective places.
- When you hear news about them,

199
00:07:58,894 --> 00:08:01,864
do you feel proud as a real dad would?

200
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:03,693
That's right.

201
00:08:03,694 --> 00:08:06,033
I half think that they're my children...

202
00:08:06,034 --> 00:08:08,434
and half think that they're my good junior actors.

203
00:08:09,134 --> 00:08:12,304
This child has one strength, and that child has another strength.

204
00:08:12,344 --> 00:08:14,814
Every time I meet them, it feels new.

205
00:08:15,144 --> 00:08:18,074
Even when it has been ten years...

206
00:08:18,614 --> 00:08:20,784
Even when it has been a while, she remains the same.

207
00:08:21,314 --> 00:08:23,214
- She's cheerful and optimistic.
- She's always cheerful.

208
00:08:23,714 --> 00:08:25,024
Sung Won is the same.

209
00:08:25,124 --> 00:08:27,023
Honestly speaking, he was the nicest.

210
00:08:27,024 --> 00:08:28,693
- They...
- What does that make the girls?

211
00:08:28,694 --> 00:08:32,264
I didn't mean it like that. They're nice as well, but...

212
00:08:32,364 --> 00:08:34,624
I saw this from Sung Won's material.

213
00:08:34,724 --> 00:08:36,463
He felt like he wouldn't get the role,

214
00:08:36,464 --> 00:08:39,233
so he sat there in a dejected state.

215
00:08:39,234 --> 00:08:41,104
The casting director thought he suited the character's image.

216
00:08:41,704 --> 00:08:43,403
- That's right.
- It's true.

217
00:08:43,404 --> 00:08:46,974
I still remember that I had Chil Bong's lines.

218
00:08:47,104 --> 00:08:49,013
I went, "Until the waters of the East Sea run dry..."

219
00:08:49,014 --> 00:08:50,914
"and Mount Paektu wears down,"

220
00:08:51,274 --> 00:08:53,383
- "may the higher power..." - That's No Eul.

221
00:08:53,384 --> 00:08:55,354
The director chuckled.

222
00:08:55,514 --> 00:08:58,054
I was like, "What?" Then he asked me to stay still.

223
00:08:58,384 --> 00:09:00,423
(Answer: Sung No Eul)

224
00:09:00,424 --> 00:09:01,424
That's No Eul!

225
00:09:01,425 --> 00:09:04,494
(Even at a second glance, he's No Eul.)

226
00:09:04,554 --> 00:09:05,924
- He laughed.
- That's No Eul.

227
00:09:06,094 --> 00:09:08,933
Then he told me to come back for the second round.

228
00:09:08,934 --> 00:09:10,764
(Thus, he met a fitting role like a miracle.)

229
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:12,904
She's the one who has changed the most.

230
00:09:12,964 --> 00:09:14,303
The first daughter.

231
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:15,333
Please tell us about your first daughter.

232
00:09:15,334 --> 00:09:17,434
She has undergone a complete makeover.

233
00:09:18,444 --> 00:09:20,244
- Seriously.
- Why?

234
00:09:20,344 --> 00:09:22,444
I used to stay in the shade.

235
00:09:23,274 --> 00:09:25,143
I had a dark character.

236
00:09:25,144 --> 00:09:27,584
- I was that kind of person.
- Back in the day?

237
00:09:27,744 --> 00:09:29,983
She only cared about acting.

238
00:09:29,984 --> 00:09:33,523
She stayed serious and committed herself to acting.

239
00:09:33,524 --> 00:09:35,594
- She didn't know how to have fun.
- Right.

240
00:09:35,994 --> 00:09:38,053
I actually asked her how she had changed.

241
00:09:38,054 --> 00:09:40,064
One day, she looked in the mirror.

242
00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:42,233
She thought, "You're still very pretty."

243
00:09:42,234 --> 00:09:44,293
"Why are you being like this? Go outside."

244
00:09:44,294 --> 00:09:47,964
She felt like she needed to change.

245
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:50,273
She had that thought when she looked in the mirror.

246
00:09:50,274 --> 00:09:53,244
- She transformed after that moment.
- That's right.

247
00:09:53,474 --> 00:09:54,743
- I changed my mind.
- Really?

248
00:09:54,744 --> 00:09:55,813
- Yes.
- Yes.

249
00:09:55,814 --> 00:09:57,343
I had always looked in the mirror,

250
00:09:57,344 --> 00:09:59,814
but I seemed like a different person that day.

251
00:09:59,884 --> 00:10:01,144
I thought that.

252
00:10:01,854 --> 00:10:03,013
- So...
- It's like a drama.

253
00:10:03,014 --> 00:10:04,953
- I know.
- While filming "Reply 1988,"

254
00:10:04,954 --> 00:10:06,683
she didn't use this tone.

255
00:10:06,684 --> 00:10:08,994
- This tone. Not at all.
- She didn't talk much.

256
00:10:09,694 --> 00:10:12,793
Hye Young didn't talk much from the start.

257
00:10:12,794 --> 00:10:14,964
I watch what I say to her since then.

258
00:10:15,334 --> 00:10:16,833
(Bo Ra has a temper.)

259
00:10:16,834 --> 00:10:18,193
I don't want to get beaten up.

260
00:10:18,194 --> 00:10:19,763
Since then, I began to think,

261
00:10:19,764 --> 00:10:22,434
"Let's live like this. Let's focus on today and tomorrow."

262
00:10:23,374 --> 00:10:24,533
Congratulations.

263
00:10:24,534 --> 00:10:26,104
- Seriously. It's a big change.
- You're cool.

264
00:10:26,704 --> 00:10:29,044
(It sounds really fun.)

265
00:10:29,914 --> 00:10:32,444
(She became an icon of optimism.)

266
00:10:32,684 --> 00:10:34,984
(She has changed so much.)

267
00:10:35,314 --> 00:10:38,454
(She'll surprise everyone.)

268
00:10:39,354 --> 00:10:41,224
One more thing. If there's...

269
00:10:41,324 --> 00:10:42,453
a cherished item...

270
00:10:42,454 --> 00:10:46,193
that'll bring back memories of the past, please take it out.

271
00:10:46,194 --> 00:10:48,764
Has anyone brought an item?

272
00:10:48,934 --> 00:10:51,663
- I'm a model student, - Okay.

273
00:10:51,664 --> 00:10:53,063
so I brought these items.

274
00:10:53,064 --> 00:10:55,034
(The model student, Hye Ri, brought many items.)

275
00:10:55,474 --> 00:10:58,643
This is Deok Sun's cassette player.

276
00:10:58,644 --> 00:11:01,344
- Really? Is it yours or...
- Yes.

277
00:11:02,444 --> 00:11:04,873
- This is...
- This is for a show. Be honest.

278
00:11:04,874 --> 00:11:06,844
This is for a show. The production crew prepared it.

279
00:11:07,784 --> 00:11:09,784
(My daughter is cute.)

280
00:11:09,914 --> 00:11:11,414
The director asked me...

281
00:11:11,824 --> 00:11:13,924
to use it for the entrance.

282
00:11:14,384 --> 00:11:15,754
- Yes.
- My goodness.

283
00:11:16,224 --> 00:11:17,893
- They prepared a cassette player.
- I'm sorry.

284
00:11:17,894 --> 00:11:19,824
- What? Is that the script?
- Yes.

285
00:11:19,964 --> 00:11:21,193
My goodness.

286
00:11:21,194 --> 00:11:22,393
I brought the script.

287
00:11:22,394 --> 00:11:23,633
- Which episode is it?
- It's worn.

288
00:11:23,634 --> 00:11:24,693
Episodes 1 and 2.

289
00:11:24,694 --> 00:11:25,964
Episodes 1 and 2?

290
00:11:26,434 --> 00:11:28,134
It's covered in your notes.

291
00:11:28,304 --> 00:11:29,933
- You worked hard.
- You checked many things.

292
00:11:29,934 --> 00:11:31,433
My goodness. Look at this.

293
00:11:31,434 --> 00:11:33,774
I can't believe you kept it.

294
00:11:34,274 --> 00:11:36,614
You put so much effort into it.

295
00:11:36,974 --> 00:11:38,543
There are no notes toward the back.

296
00:11:38,544 --> 00:11:39,683
They're only in the beginning.

297
00:11:39,684 --> 00:11:41,343
It's like studying only the beginning part.

298
00:11:41,344 --> 00:11:42,684
- That's right.
- Like "The Essence of Mathematics."

299
00:11:42,954 --> 00:11:45,384
I only studied the beginning like Deok Sun.

300
00:11:45,424 --> 00:11:46,854
(She stayed true to her character.)

301
00:11:47,084 --> 00:11:48,393
- The front turned yellow.
- Yes.

302
00:11:48,394 --> 00:11:49,653
There are some notes toward the back too.

303
00:11:49,654 --> 00:11:51,293
Are the pages clean toward the back?

304
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:52,493
No, there are notes.

305
00:11:52,494 --> 00:11:53,724
- I see.
- There are notes.

306
00:11:54,064 --> 00:11:57,193
I wasn't used to acting back then.

307
00:11:57,194 --> 00:11:58,733
When the director gave me a direction,

308
00:11:58,734 --> 00:12:00,934
I wrote it down religiously...

309
00:12:01,004 --> 00:12:02,534
and tried to follow.

310
00:12:02,834 --> 00:12:04,003
"Big explosion."

311
00:12:04,004 --> 00:12:05,803
Which scene was it for?

312
00:12:05,804 --> 00:12:08,573
- "Why is my name Deok Sun?" - "Why is my name Deok Sun?"

313
00:12:08,574 --> 00:12:11,813
- I remember filming that scene.
- That's right.

314
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,983
Which scene is it? Please explain.

315
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:15,883
- All three of you know it.
- Yes.

316
00:12:15,884 --> 00:12:17,854
- It's Bo Ra's birthday party.
- It's Bo Ra's birthday party.

317
00:12:18,454 --> 00:12:19,923
It's Bo Ra's birthday party.

318
00:12:19,924 --> 00:12:22,253
Deok Sun wanted a separate birthday party,

319
00:12:22,254 --> 00:12:25,094
but she got a joint birthday party with her sister that year as well.

320
00:12:25,994 --> 00:12:28,433
(The birthday party seems to end.)

321
00:12:28,434 --> 00:12:30,064
- Thank you for the cake.
- Wait.

322
00:12:31,164 --> 00:12:32,803
Hold on a second.

323
00:12:32,804 --> 00:12:35,133
(Deok Sun senses that something is wrong.)

324
00:12:35,134 --> 00:12:37,034
Hold on a second.

325
00:12:39,104 --> 00:12:41,813
Now comes a birthday party for my second daughter.

326
00:12:41,814 --> 00:12:43,774
In 1, 2, 3.

327
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:45,914
- Happy...
- Stop it already!

328
00:12:47,144 --> 00:12:50,814
I told you that I didn't want a joint birthday party with Bo Ra!

329
00:12:51,014 --> 00:12:52,023
(The beginning of the big explosion)

330
00:12:52,024 --> 00:12:53,724
Why do you never listen to me?

331
00:12:54,284 --> 00:12:55,993
I told you that I didn't want...

332
00:12:55,994 --> 00:12:58,194
a joint birthday party with Bo Ra!

333
00:13:00,064 --> 00:13:01,064
Deok Sun.

334
00:13:01,324 --> 00:13:04,464
Why is my name Deok Sun?

335
00:13:05,104 --> 00:13:06,563
(The second child's pent-up frustration explodes.)

336
00:13:06,564 --> 00:13:08,364
Why is my name Deok Sun?

337
00:13:09,134 --> 00:13:11,204
She's Bo Ra, and he's No Eul,

338
00:13:11,534 --> 00:13:13,373
so why is my name Deok Sun?

339
00:13:13,374 --> 00:13:15,414
Why is my name Deok Sun?

340
00:13:16,644 --> 00:13:19,683
(Deok Sun leaves the house right away.)

341
00:13:19,684 --> 00:13:22,553
She explodes in anger.

342
00:13:22,554 --> 00:13:23,613
She did an amazing job.

343
00:13:23,614 --> 00:13:25,423
I still remember the shoot...

344
00:13:25,424 --> 00:13:27,353
- because of her amazing take.
- Right. I remember the shoot.

345
00:13:27,354 --> 00:13:29,724
I come outside...

346
00:13:29,794 --> 00:13:31,993
and buy her a separate cake in front of a supermarket.

347
00:13:31,994 --> 00:13:33,423
"It's my first time being a dad."

348
00:13:33,424 --> 00:13:34,963
That's right.

349
00:13:34,964 --> 00:13:36,564
- That's right.
- That's right.

350
00:13:36,764 --> 00:13:39,603
(Let's enjoy the scene.)

351
00:13:39,604 --> 00:13:40,934
Ta-da!

352
00:13:43,834 --> 00:13:45,574
Deok Sun, happy birthday.

353
00:13:49,314 --> 00:13:50,574
Mom and Dad...

354
00:13:51,574 --> 00:13:52,744
are sorry.

355
00:13:55,254 --> 00:13:56,954
I wasn't born...

356
00:13:58,454 --> 00:13:59,784
a dad.

357
00:14:00,954 --> 00:14:02,724
It's my first time being a dad.

358
00:14:04,124 --> 00:14:06,493
(Dad's sincere words stops Deok Sun's tears.)

359
00:14:06,494 --> 00:14:09,094
So please forgive me.

360
00:14:09,834 --> 00:14:12,433
I think that scene became big...

361
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:15,204
among the dads of Korea.

362
00:14:15,504 --> 00:14:18,674
The dads who didn't know how to show their love.

363
00:14:19,104 --> 00:14:21,103
- Those days.
- It has been ten years,

364
00:14:21,104 --> 00:14:23,943
but you still remember the scene...

365
00:14:23,944 --> 00:14:26,414
and the emotions you felt while filming it.

366
00:14:26,584 --> 00:14:28,783
It wasn't focused on how moving it was. It was so windy...

367
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,414
that we had to do so many retakes.

368
00:14:31,984 --> 00:14:34,884
He's lying. Dad cried a lot too.

369
00:14:35,024 --> 00:14:36,293
Won Ho told me to cry.

370
00:14:36,294 --> 00:14:37,594
(The director of "Reply 1988")

371
00:14:37,724 --> 00:14:39,924
Dong Il just says those things.

372
00:14:40,024 --> 00:14:41,224
It has become a habit.

373
00:14:41,394 --> 00:14:43,794
(Dads always say something they don't mean.)

374
00:14:43,994 --> 00:14:45,333
I told you...

375
00:14:45,334 --> 00:14:46,703
- that there were other teams.
- Yes.

376
00:14:46,704 --> 00:14:47,963
I don't know...

377
00:14:47,964 --> 00:14:49,674
who are meeting where.

378
00:14:49,874 --> 00:14:52,504
Aside from the members of your family,

379
00:14:52,644 --> 00:14:56,273
is there anyone you wondered how they were doing?

380
00:14:56,274 --> 00:14:57,644
- None.
- "None?"

381
00:14:58,514 --> 00:15:00,584
I'm not curious about anyone at all.

382
00:15:02,154 --> 00:15:03,613
(The next family is here.)

383
00:15:03,614 --> 00:15:05,324
Cheetah.

384
00:15:06,224 --> 00:15:07,324
How loud.

385
00:15:08,384 --> 00:15:09,924
It's tiresome.

386
00:15:10,454 --> 00:15:11,554
Honey.

387
00:15:12,064 --> 00:15:13,464
In the meantime,

388
00:15:14,524 --> 00:15:16,734
you must have won another lottery.

389
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:18,704
(This family became rich by winning the lottery.)

390
00:15:19,034 --> 00:15:21,933
(The second family that suits the western-style house the most)

391
00:15:21,934 --> 00:15:24,234
(It's Jung Bong's family.)

392
00:15:24,604 --> 00:15:26,143
(Kim Sung Kyun, Ra Mi Ran)

393
00:15:26,144 --> 00:15:28,143
It's like today will bring back...

394
00:15:28,144 --> 00:15:31,744
the memories I've forgotten about.

395
00:15:33,114 --> 00:15:34,543
This must be the place.

396
00:15:34,544 --> 00:15:35,884
(A western-style coffee shop)

397
00:15:36,014 --> 00:15:37,154
Let me open...

398
00:15:38,184 --> 00:15:39,724
- Hold on.
- What are you doing?

399
00:15:40,354 --> 00:15:41,584
How do you open it?

400
00:15:42,354 --> 00:15:43,794
Why is this making me nervous?

401
00:15:47,494 --> 00:15:49,634
(Ryu Jun Yeol playing Kim Jung Hwan)

402
00:15:51,834 --> 00:15:53,004
Is anyone home?

403
00:15:53,404 --> 00:15:55,203
- Here, Mi Ok.
- Right.

404
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,804
- Goodness.
- Hello.

405
00:15:58,334 --> 00:16:00,603
Don't I look like a bear right now?

406
00:16:00,604 --> 00:16:01,643
No, you look pretty.

407
00:16:01,644 --> 00:16:04,644
- Like a bear with a cheetah's fur.
- Really pretty.

408
00:16:05,044 --> 00:16:07,613
- For a day.
- That's not what matters.

409
00:16:07,614 --> 00:16:08,814
Goodness.

410
00:16:09,754 --> 00:16:11,054
Why are you over there?

411
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:13,724
I'm Shin Won Ho, doing variety shows under Na Yeong Seok.

412
00:16:14,484 --> 00:16:16,054
You must be new.

413
00:16:16,254 --> 00:16:17,793
Didn't you come thinking all the families...

414
00:16:17,794 --> 00:16:19,323
- were getting together?
- Yes.

415
00:16:19,324 --> 00:16:20,663
I was going to surprise everyone...

416
00:16:20,664 --> 00:16:22,734
and then take this off quickly.

417
00:16:23,394 --> 00:16:25,364
- How embarrassing.
- It really suits you.

418
00:16:25,764 --> 00:16:27,063
- Let me.
- Someone's here.

419
00:16:27,064 --> 00:16:28,464
Oh, my. Who is she?

420
00:16:28,604 --> 00:16:29,874
We don't have a daughter.

421
00:16:29,974 --> 00:16:31,473
- Here, Mi Ok.
- Right.

422
00:16:31,474 --> 00:16:34,404
(It's the Kim family's eldest son and his girlfriend.)

423
00:16:34,974 --> 00:16:37,513
(That greeting when welcoming someone)

424
00:16:37,514 --> 00:16:38,813
(What was it again?)

425
00:16:38,814 --> 00:16:40,013
Jung Bong.

426
00:16:40,014 --> 00:16:42,684
You should say, "It's so good to see you."

427
00:16:42,954 --> 00:16:44,014
Gosh, honey.

428
00:16:44,154 --> 00:16:45,754
Goodness.

429
00:16:46,524 --> 00:16:47,654
(Laughing)

430
00:16:47,684 --> 00:16:49,653
- Dad.
- It's so...

431
00:16:49,654 --> 00:16:51,823
- good to see you.
- Good to see you.

432
00:16:51,824 --> 00:16:54,263
(They barely succeed in reenacting the greeting.)

433
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:56,494
- You still have good knee joints.
- Hey.

434
00:16:56,664 --> 00:16:58,734
- Oh, our daughter-in-law is here.
- Gosh.

435
00:16:59,864 --> 00:17:02,204
- My daughter-in-law.
- It's been a while.

436
00:17:02,934 --> 00:17:04,433
- You two haven't changed.
- I'm your daughter-in-law,

437
00:17:04,434 --> 00:17:05,904
but we are meeting for the first time today.

438
00:17:06,474 --> 00:17:08,874
- We never got the chance to meet.
- It's our first time meeting.

439
00:17:09,444 --> 00:17:11,414
Have you stopped with the margarine?

440
00:17:11,514 --> 00:17:13,344
- Margarine.
- I've been holding back.

441
00:17:13,444 --> 00:17:15,383
So you two have yet to get married.

442
00:17:15,384 --> 00:17:16,513
- Is that so?
- Gosh.

443
00:17:16,514 --> 00:17:17,814
I'm not sure.

444
00:17:17,884 --> 00:17:19,653
You've got to confirm it.

445
00:17:19,654 --> 00:17:21,224
- Confirm? How about it?
- Yes.

446
00:17:21,254 --> 00:17:22,954
(Confirm what?)

447
00:17:22,994 --> 00:17:23,994
(The "confirm" they're talking about is...)

448
00:17:23,995 --> 00:17:26,524
It's been a while, so confirm it.

449
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:28,594
Confirmation.

450
00:17:29,594 --> 00:17:32,964
(Whether his pounding heart was due to a disease or Mi Ok,)

451
00:17:34,164 --> 00:17:37,104
(it was Jung Bong's way of confirming it.)

452
00:17:38,704 --> 00:17:40,303
- Can you do it right now?
- Of course.

453
00:17:40,304 --> 00:17:41,744
(Laughing)

454
00:17:41,904 --> 00:17:43,074
Is anyone home?

455
00:17:43,414 --> 00:17:44,874
- Someone's here.
- Who is it?

456
00:17:45,384 --> 00:17:46,484
Anyone home?

457
00:17:46,884 --> 00:17:48,714
(The youngest is here!)

458
00:17:49,154 --> 00:17:50,584
For real?

459
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:53,284
- I heard you couldn't make it.
- You couldn't make it, no?

460
00:17:53,824 --> 00:17:55,524
Nice to meet you. Hey.

461
00:17:55,724 --> 00:17:56,794
Gosh, really...

462
00:17:56,994 --> 00:17:59,123
(Once again, since it's nice to see him)

463
00:17:59,124 --> 00:18:01,023
Gosh, Mr. Kim.

464
00:18:01,024 --> 00:18:02,233
- "Mr. Kim" again.
- How embarrassing.

465
00:18:02,234 --> 00:18:03,263
It's so...

466
00:18:03,264 --> 00:18:05,533
- good to see you.
- Good to see you.

467
00:18:05,534 --> 00:18:07,234
(But twice a day isn't easy.)

468
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:09,833
My gosh.

469
00:18:09,834 --> 00:18:11,173
- Oh, dear.
- It's nice but embarrassing.

470
00:18:11,174 --> 00:18:12,803
(The family welcomes him with a big hug.)

471
00:18:12,804 --> 00:18:14,973
- The greeting comes out naturally.
- Gosh.

472
00:18:14,974 --> 00:18:16,014
Right?

473
00:18:16,214 --> 00:18:18,573
- We're wearing similar colors, - Is he still a Kim?

474
00:18:18,574 --> 00:18:19,813
- just in different fabrics.
- In the past,

475
00:18:19,814 --> 00:18:21,013
siblings...

476
00:18:21,014 --> 00:18:23,054
- wore similar colors.
- Take a seat.

477
00:18:23,084 --> 00:18:25,253
Jun Yeol actually had...

478
00:18:25,254 --> 00:18:27,783
prior plans and couldn't miss them.

479
00:18:27,784 --> 00:18:31,653
But he was able to make it to the morning family gathering.

480
00:18:31,654 --> 00:18:34,094
- Fortunately, the shoot is nearby.
- Exactly.

481
00:18:34,194 --> 00:18:35,594
It's in Gangwon Province.

482
00:18:35,834 --> 00:18:37,393
He'll be with us for this shoot.

483
00:18:37,394 --> 00:18:38,594
This shoot? I see.

484
00:18:39,464 --> 00:18:40,733
Even though it's a coffee shop,

485
00:18:40,734 --> 00:18:42,033
it really feels...

486
00:18:42,034 --> 00:18:43,304
- Like our house, right?
- like our old house.

487
00:18:43,474 --> 00:18:45,003
It actually has a basement.

488
00:18:45,004 --> 00:18:46,074
(Where Jung Bong's family has gathered)

489
00:18:47,104 --> 00:18:49,873
(Looking exactly like the house...)

490
00:18:49,874 --> 00:18:52,614
(Jung Bong's family lived in in the drama)

491
00:18:53,984 --> 00:18:57,054
(No matter...)

492
00:18:58,214 --> 00:19:00,984
(how you look at it,)

493
00:19:02,854 --> 00:19:05,924
(it's a western-style house renovated into a coffee shop.)

494
00:19:07,024 --> 00:19:09,893
You haven't seen each other in a while, have you?

495
00:19:09,894 --> 00:19:11,964
- We haven't.
- It's been ages.

496
00:19:12,134 --> 00:19:14,133
Jae Hong and Mi Ran...

497
00:19:14,134 --> 00:19:15,364
Should I be calling her "Mom?"

498
00:19:15,804 --> 00:19:17,503
- Mom.
- It was the same during the shoot.

499
00:19:17,504 --> 00:19:18,904
You kept calling your mom by her name.

500
00:19:19,374 --> 00:19:21,674
I met Jung Bong and Mom...

501
00:19:21,704 --> 00:19:23,913
- during a movie preview.
- Right.

502
00:19:23,914 --> 00:19:25,883
- We bumped into each other, right?
- Yes.

503
00:19:25,884 --> 00:19:27,214
- At award ceremonies.
- Yes.

504
00:19:27,314 --> 00:19:28,314
As for Sung Kyun...

505
00:19:28,315 --> 00:19:29,514
No.

506
00:19:29,914 --> 00:19:31,214
(Failed to get into character)

507
00:19:31,384 --> 00:19:32,923
- Just call me Sung Kyun.
- Dad...

508
00:19:32,924 --> 00:19:33,954
Here's the thing.

509
00:19:33,984 --> 00:19:35,494
I haven't seen them in a while,

510
00:19:35,594 --> 00:19:36,693
but none of them seem to have aged.

511
00:19:36,694 --> 00:19:38,723
- Didn't they become younger?
- Well...

512
00:19:38,724 --> 00:19:40,294
No, are those two different?

513
00:19:40,394 --> 00:19:42,394
Dressed up in this outfit makes me hungry.

514
00:19:43,334 --> 00:19:45,504
I'm constantly hungry.

515
00:19:45,564 --> 00:19:47,263
You feel the need to fuel up, right?

516
00:19:47,264 --> 00:19:48,604
So you're hungry.

517
00:19:48,974 --> 00:19:50,173
- Did you bring something?
- Do you have something?

518
00:19:50,174 --> 00:19:51,834
For my dear Jung Bong.

519
00:19:52,144 --> 00:19:53,504
- Some eggs.
- Goodness.

520
00:19:53,974 --> 00:19:55,174
- Mom.
- For real?

521
00:19:55,674 --> 00:19:57,213
Are the other families also meeting...

522
00:19:57,214 --> 00:19:58,743
- at the same time?
- Yes.

523
00:19:58,744 --> 00:20:00,444
- Really?
- Is that so?

524
00:20:00,514 --> 00:20:01,814
- As for Min Ji, - Right.

525
00:20:02,554 --> 00:20:03,683
- she's the daughter-in-law.
- The daughter-in-law.

526
00:20:03,684 --> 00:20:05,354
- Sister-in-law.
- As my sister-in-law.

527
00:20:05,724 --> 00:20:06,924
Did your father not come with you?

528
00:20:07,084 --> 00:20:08,183
I can't get...

529
00:20:08,184 --> 00:20:09,623
- in touch with my dad.
- Isn't her father...

530
00:20:09,624 --> 00:20:11,253
- Go Chang Suk?
- Yes.

531
00:20:11,254 --> 00:20:12,864
- You're right.
- The thing is,

532
00:20:13,094 --> 00:20:15,934
the director told me about it just before the shoot.

533
00:20:16,264 --> 00:20:19,803
Back then, spoilers were...

534
00:20:19,804 --> 00:20:21,264
The scripts were always kept secure.

535
00:20:21,604 --> 00:20:22,933
It would've been the end if we had lost any.

536
00:20:22,934 --> 00:20:24,703
- We grilled you to always keep...
- To keep them well.

537
00:20:24,704 --> 00:20:25,843
your scripts and schedule sheet.

538
00:20:25,844 --> 00:20:28,403
Let me explain the scripts of the "Reply" series.

539
00:20:28,404 --> 00:20:29,413
It's just that...

540
00:20:29,414 --> 00:20:32,984
I brought them, as the notes I took ten years ago were impressive.

541
00:20:33,344 --> 00:20:35,314
During "Reply 1994," it was a role...

542
00:20:35,654 --> 00:20:38,883
- that was too young for me.
- A college student.

543
00:20:38,884 --> 00:20:42,424
To establish a mindset,

544
00:20:43,024 --> 00:20:45,524
I wrote, "I'm young."

545
00:20:46,164 --> 00:20:47,723
- I kept telling myself...
- "I'm young."

546
00:20:47,724 --> 00:20:49,494
"I'm young" whenever I looked at it.

547
00:20:49,594 --> 00:20:53,063
In the next work, "Reply 1988,"

548
00:20:53,064 --> 00:20:54,904
this is what I wrote.

549
00:20:55,304 --> 00:20:57,203
- "I'm old." - "I'm old."

550
00:20:57,204 --> 00:20:58,834
(I'm old.)

551
00:20:59,544 --> 00:21:00,703
This role...

552
00:21:00,704 --> 00:21:04,643
was older than me.

553
00:21:04,644 --> 00:21:08,244
It was just interesting to me.

554
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:09,783
That's why I brought them.

555
00:21:09,784 --> 00:21:10,813
As for me...

556
00:21:10,814 --> 00:21:11,913
(Next is Jae Hong's treasure)

557
00:21:11,914 --> 00:21:13,353
It's what I wore during the drama.

558
00:21:13,354 --> 00:21:14,884
Gosh, really?

559
00:21:15,484 --> 00:21:16,593
- You kept it?
- Jung Bong's shirt.

560
00:21:16,594 --> 00:21:18,794
To think that he actually wore it several times at home.

561
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:20,493
Did you wear it at home?

562
00:21:20,494 --> 00:21:22,763
I wore it every now and then,

563
00:21:22,764 --> 00:21:24,494
- "Every now and then?" - but not outside.

564
00:21:24,834 --> 00:21:26,603
Back then,

565
00:21:26,604 --> 00:21:29,574
he tucked the shirt into the sweatpants.

566
00:21:29,604 --> 00:21:31,603
- So it was quite baggy...
- True.

567
00:21:31,604 --> 00:21:33,074
around the waist.

568
00:21:33,504 --> 00:21:35,873
Did you actually make this shirt?

569
00:21:35,874 --> 00:21:37,074
- Yes, we did.
- I see.

570
00:21:38,514 --> 00:21:40,584
The drama had quite a few details,

571
00:21:40,644 --> 00:21:43,053
- including the props.
- Right.

572
00:21:43,054 --> 00:21:45,853
There were several props I wanted to take with me.

573
00:21:45,854 --> 00:21:47,583
- I recall the cocoa container.
- They're expensive.

574
00:21:47,584 --> 00:21:49,053
- Was it Milo?
- Yes.

575
00:21:49,054 --> 00:21:50,093
(From food to daily props)

576
00:21:50,094 --> 00:21:51,123
Things like that.

577
00:21:51,124 --> 00:21:52,523
- In those days...
- The containers.

578
00:21:52,524 --> 00:21:53,693
Finding them wasn't easy.

579
00:21:53,694 --> 00:21:56,794
(Spotting old props in the drama was fun.)

580
00:21:58,194 --> 00:21:59,934
(Spaghetti)

581
00:22:00,304 --> 00:22:01,904
(Creamer)

582
00:22:02,374 --> 00:22:04,104
(Ham)

583
00:22:04,374 --> 00:22:07,374
(And even actual ice cream)

584
00:22:08,344 --> 00:22:12,914
(Aside from actual props, there were also hidden details.)

585
00:22:13,714 --> 00:22:15,044
(Vinyl records)

586
00:22:15,244 --> 00:22:16,683
(Cassette tapes)

587
00:22:16,684 --> 00:22:18,284
(Pride, the car)

588
00:22:18,354 --> 00:22:19,553
(Others include social studies, math, and English textbooks,)

589
00:22:19,554 --> 00:22:20,783
("The Essence of Mathematics," an English-to-Korean dictionary,)

590
00:22:20,784 --> 00:22:22,084
(a pencil case, and notebooks)

591
00:22:22,394 --> 00:22:25,293
Jung Bong had opened a canned ham in one scene.

592
00:22:25,294 --> 00:22:26,523
Right, a canned ham like that...

593
00:22:26,524 --> 00:22:27,793
- couldn't be found.
- The one you open like this.

594
00:22:27,794 --> 00:22:28,963
- Yes.
- Right.

595
00:22:28,964 --> 00:22:31,333
Finding such a ham was impossible,

596
00:22:31,334 --> 00:22:32,934
but the props team bought it...

597
00:22:33,504 --> 00:22:34,804
- from Sweden.
- Really?

598
00:22:35,234 --> 00:22:38,104
- Gosh.
- The delivery took 1.5 to 2 months.

599
00:22:38,234 --> 00:22:39,843
One bad shot, and it would've been over.

600
00:22:39,844 --> 00:22:41,603
How many did you have?

601
00:22:41,604 --> 00:22:42,773
Two? Or was it one?

602
00:22:42,774 --> 00:22:43,943
- Was it 1 or 2?
- I succeeded in 1 take.

603
00:22:43,944 --> 00:22:45,474
I was able to eat a spoonful in one go.

604
00:22:45,514 --> 00:22:47,643
- The reaction was great.
- And so, you can see...

605
00:22:47,644 --> 00:22:49,254
my hand trembling as I eat it.

606
00:22:50,754 --> 00:22:52,423
But those who watched it...

607
00:22:52,424 --> 00:22:54,923
would've thought it was due to your appetite.

608
00:22:54,924 --> 00:22:57,094
I thought you were shaking from excitement.

609
00:22:57,824 --> 00:23:00,464
(Opening the only 2 hams available)

610
00:23:03,834 --> 00:23:07,234
(Starting to shake)

611
00:23:09,234 --> 00:23:10,874
(Impressed)

612
00:23:11,674 --> 00:23:14,204
(Director Won Ho: Okay, cut.)

613
00:23:16,114 --> 00:23:17,674
- Goodness.
- The props team had it tough.

614
00:23:17,844 --> 00:23:19,714
- Really.
- That's amazing.

615
00:23:19,914 --> 00:23:21,883
When dramas ended in the past,

616
00:23:21,884 --> 00:23:23,983
- they were forgotten quickly.
- Yes.

617
00:23:23,984 --> 00:23:26,753
But these days, dramas have become like songs and movies.

618
00:23:26,754 --> 00:23:29,254
- Like old songs.
- People rewatch them again.

619
00:23:29,424 --> 00:23:31,493
I had no idea the "Reply" series was watched...

620
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:33,323
- so much overseas.
- Same here.

621
00:23:33,324 --> 00:23:34,363
So...

622
00:23:34,364 --> 00:23:36,363
Not long ago, around last year,

623
00:23:36,364 --> 00:23:38,863
I went to India to shoot a documentary.

624
00:23:38,864 --> 00:23:41,204
An Indian was passing by when they asked,

625
00:23:41,364 --> 00:23:42,674
"Jung Bong?"

626
00:23:42,704 --> 00:23:43,973
- Really?
- I'm serious.

627
00:23:43,974 --> 00:23:45,134
"Jung Bong?"

628
00:23:45,334 --> 00:23:47,843
At least they remember your name.

629
00:23:47,844 --> 00:23:48,873
As for me,

630
00:23:48,874 --> 00:23:50,144
it's "Jung Bong's mom?"

631
00:23:50,874 --> 00:23:52,344
"Jung Bong's mom?"

632
00:23:53,144 --> 00:23:56,213
The movie "No Other Choice" was released recently.

633
00:23:56,214 --> 00:23:58,484
Director Park Chan Wook rarely watches dramas.

634
00:23:58,584 --> 00:24:00,784
But he really enjoyed "Reply 1988."

635
00:24:01,184 --> 00:24:02,724
I remember him telling me that.

636
00:24:03,524 --> 00:24:04,624
He watched it several times.

637
00:24:04,754 --> 00:24:05,863
Apparently, the director knows...

638
00:24:05,864 --> 00:24:06,963
- everyone.
- Yes.

639
00:24:06,964 --> 00:24:09,093
To be honest,

640
00:24:09,094 --> 00:24:10,263
I'm quite emotional right now.

641
00:24:10,264 --> 00:24:11,663
- Why?
- Little did I expect you...

642
00:24:11,664 --> 00:24:13,064
to come dressed up like that.

643
00:24:13,164 --> 00:24:15,873
I did ask you to come in clothes...

644
00:24:15,874 --> 00:24:17,734
that were worn in the drama.

645
00:24:17,834 --> 00:24:20,273
But I thought you wouldn't listen.

646
00:24:20,274 --> 00:24:21,973
- Come on, we do as asked.
- Didn't we...

647
00:24:21,974 --> 00:24:23,613
Weren't we the most docile people?

648
00:24:23,614 --> 00:24:24,843
And I mean our family.

649
00:24:24,844 --> 00:24:26,344
- We did everything as asked.
- Exactly.

650
00:24:26,414 --> 00:24:27,744
We ate everything as asked.

651
00:24:28,184 --> 00:24:29,313
We acted as asked.

652
00:24:29,314 --> 00:24:31,154
- We ate everything as asked.
- Even when we were full.

653
00:24:32,014 --> 00:24:33,023
Don't tell me...

654
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:34,754
it's only us who have worn such clothes.

655
00:24:35,824 --> 00:24:36,894
The others dressed up more.

656
00:24:37,394 --> 00:24:38,493
- Imagine if...
- The other families...

657
00:24:38,494 --> 00:24:40,423
couldn't have dressed up...

658
00:24:40,424 --> 00:24:41,493
more than me.

659
00:24:41,494 --> 00:24:43,394
Dong Ryong came in the MBC Cheongnyong setup.

660
00:24:43,894 --> 00:24:46,263
- He did?
- That's his daily outfit.

661
00:24:46,264 --> 00:24:48,863
(Reply 1988)

662
00:24:48,864 --> 00:24:51,774
(The last place the rest of the families will gather)

663
00:24:52,704 --> 00:24:55,644
(Which Ssangmun-dong families will meet here?)

664
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:58,374
Hi.

665
00:24:58,544 --> 00:24:59,683
Hi.

666
00:24:59,684 --> 00:25:02,314
(Ko Kyung Pyo playing Shin Sun Woo, Kim Sun Young playing Kim Sun Young)

667
00:25:02,514 --> 00:25:03,654
- Hi.
- Gosh.

668
00:25:04,014 --> 00:25:05,453
- We got here first.
- Hi.

669
00:25:05,454 --> 00:25:07,554
- Hi.
- Hi.

670
00:25:08,554 --> 00:25:11,854
(Sun Woo's family has arrived first.)

671
00:25:12,024 --> 00:25:13,563
- Where?
- The middle. Sit inside.

672
00:25:13,564 --> 00:25:14,964
No, sit here.

673
00:25:15,024 --> 00:25:16,493
I'm tall even when I sit.

674
00:25:16,494 --> 00:25:17,534
- Is that so?
- Yes.

675
00:25:17,734 --> 00:25:19,734
I heard the farther from the camera, the better.

676
00:25:19,804 --> 00:25:20,864
- Really?
- Yes.

677
00:25:21,204 --> 00:25:22,264
(Laughing)

678
00:25:22,704 --> 00:25:24,004
Do we start the game now?

679
00:25:24,674 --> 00:25:25,703
No?

680
00:25:25,704 --> 00:25:28,174
- Everyone needs to come.
- So everyone needs to come.

681
00:25:28,544 --> 00:25:30,943
Jin Ju is also a family member.

682
00:25:30,944 --> 00:25:32,443
- Exactly, but she's not here.
- Right.

683
00:25:32,444 --> 00:25:34,113
Neither my husband nor Jin Ju is here.

684
00:25:34,114 --> 00:25:35,144
But you have a husband.

685
00:25:35,314 --> 00:25:36,484
Oh, right, I do have one.

686
00:25:38,054 --> 00:25:39,684
But why isn't he here?

687
00:25:39,924 --> 00:25:41,653
Why isn't he here when we're a family?

688
00:25:41,654 --> 00:25:42,853
Bo Gum should be here too.

689
00:25:42,854 --> 00:25:44,453
Why did you split us apart?

690
00:25:44,454 --> 00:25:46,523
I've got two sons now that I think of it.

691
00:25:46,524 --> 00:25:48,024
(Son 1)

692
00:25:49,064 --> 00:25:50,094
(Son 2)

693
00:25:50,864 --> 00:25:53,264
- Your hair is hilarious.
- Don't I look the same?

694
00:25:53,364 --> 00:25:54,364
Not bad, is it?

695
00:25:54,434 --> 00:25:56,334
No, but it's too funny.

696
00:25:57,274 --> 00:25:58,804
It's like we've traveled back ten years.

697
00:25:59,944 --> 00:26:01,804
- I'll open it.
- Thank you.

698
00:26:02,614 --> 00:26:03,674
It opens like this?

699
00:26:05,014 --> 00:26:06,043
(Taek's family enters quite flashily.)

700
00:26:06,044 --> 00:26:07,644
- Hi.
- Hi.

701
00:26:07,884 --> 00:26:08,943
Hi.

702
00:26:08,944 --> 00:26:10,014
(But they still hold hands.)

703
00:26:13,054 --> 00:26:14,984
(Smiling)

704
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:16,623
Bo Gum.

705
00:26:16,624 --> 00:26:17,653
- Taek.
- Hi.

706
00:26:17,654 --> 00:26:19,524
- Oh, my.
- My mom.

707
00:26:19,964 --> 00:26:21,394
(My wife)

708
00:26:21,424 --> 00:26:23,164
- Hello.
- Hi.

709
00:26:23,634 --> 00:26:24,634
- Bo Gum.
- Dad.

710
00:26:24,635 --> 00:26:26,003
It's been a while.

711
00:26:26,004 --> 00:26:27,233
- Moo Sung.
- Have you been well?

712
00:26:27,234 --> 00:26:28,403
- Gosh.
- Long time no see.

713
00:26:28,404 --> 00:26:30,333
Moo Sung. We met not long ago.

714
00:26:30,334 --> 00:26:31,404
Right.

715
00:26:31,574 --> 00:26:32,843
- Where do we sit?
- Bo Gum.

716
00:26:32,844 --> 00:26:34,173
You got your haircut too.

717
00:26:34,174 --> 00:26:35,743
Yes. Did you get your hair done for this show?

718
00:26:35,744 --> 00:26:37,244
- Yes.
- It's not a wig, is it?

719
00:26:37,874 --> 00:26:39,583
- Did you get a haircut?
- It's a wig.

720
00:26:39,584 --> 00:26:40,883
- A wig.
- Is it a wig?

721
00:26:40,884 --> 00:26:42,214
I couldn't tell it was one.

722
00:26:42,344 --> 00:26:43,883
Because of the amount of hair,

723
00:26:43,884 --> 00:26:45,983
I thought Bo Gum was still young.

724
00:26:45,984 --> 00:26:47,523
Because of the wig,

725
00:26:47,524 --> 00:26:49,593
it feels like my whole face has been lifted up.

726
00:26:49,594 --> 00:26:50,754
You still look like Bo Gum.

727
00:26:50,954 --> 00:26:52,024
You do.

728
00:26:52,524 --> 00:26:53,594
Taek.

729
00:26:54,224 --> 00:26:56,093
It ended with you all becoming a family, right?

730
00:26:56,094 --> 00:26:57,294
- Yes.
- Yes.

731
00:26:57,434 --> 00:26:59,464
That's right. Who are the other two?

732
00:27:00,464 --> 00:27:01,503
I'm curious.

733
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:02,774
(One family has gathered.)

734
00:27:02,934 --> 00:27:04,173
Who are the other two?

735
00:27:04,174 --> 00:27:05,874
(What's with the 2 chairs?)

736
00:27:06,404 --> 00:27:09,274
(2 colorful guys have appeared.)

737
00:27:09,314 --> 00:27:10,773
(Lee Dong Hwi, Ryu Jae Myung)

738
00:27:10,774 --> 00:27:13,983
It's my first variety show in ten years.

739
00:27:13,984 --> 00:27:16,754
- Has it been that long?
- I didn't appear in any.

740
00:27:16,884 --> 00:27:19,153
Making rejection a habit makes it hard for me to be in one.

741
00:27:19,154 --> 00:27:21,754
- It's best not to be in one.
- True.

742
00:27:21,884 --> 00:27:23,324
- You haven't changed.
- That's not true.

743
00:27:23,454 --> 00:27:25,624
- I tried this setup after years.
- Right.

744
00:27:26,064 --> 00:27:27,794
It felt humiliating.

745
00:27:28,124 --> 00:27:29,633
- It felt humiliating.
- How come?

746
00:27:29,634 --> 00:27:31,694
I just heard "humiliating."

747
00:27:32,294 --> 00:27:34,033
- Dong Hwi.
- Hi.

748
00:27:34,034 --> 00:27:35,204
Hi.

749
00:27:35,804 --> 00:27:38,174
- Look at Jae Myung.
- Goodness.

750
00:27:39,204 --> 00:27:41,204
- Isn't that the real outfit?
- Wait.

751
00:27:41,304 --> 00:27:42,503
The outfit is exactly the same.

752
00:27:42,504 --> 00:27:44,173
Isn't that the outfit from the drama?

753
00:27:44,174 --> 00:27:45,874
- Yes, it is.
- Have you been well?

754
00:27:46,484 --> 00:27:47,513
Hi.

755
00:27:47,514 --> 00:27:48,583
(Ssangmun High School's supervisor greets everyone.)

756
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:51,554
Jae Myung, that's... I can't believe it.

757
00:27:52,184 --> 00:27:54,284
You know,

758
00:27:54,384 --> 00:27:56,193
after getting into this outfit,

759
00:27:56,194 --> 00:27:58,153
I was worried I would...

760
00:27:58,154 --> 00:27:59,764
- stand out the most.
- I see.

761
00:27:59,824 --> 00:28:01,024
But I've lost.

762
00:28:01,824 --> 00:28:05,334
If you don't mind me asking, is my mom not coming?

763
00:28:08,304 --> 00:28:09,774
Your mom doesn't exist.

764
00:28:09,874 --> 00:28:12,134
(Mom, the Queen of Insurance)

765
00:28:12,334 --> 00:28:13,973
Have you all met in private?

766
00:28:13,974 --> 00:28:15,403
Do the adults and kids meet separately?

767
00:28:15,404 --> 00:28:17,343
- Yes, that's how we meet.
- That's how we hang out.

768
00:28:17,344 --> 00:28:20,013
But when they perform, and we go watch it.

769
00:28:20,014 --> 00:28:21,814
Or at award ceremonies.

770
00:28:21,884 --> 00:28:23,413
- At previews, award ceremonies, - Yes.

771
00:28:23,414 --> 00:28:24,954
or performances.

772
00:28:25,154 --> 00:28:26,984
I often get in touch with Bo Gum.

773
00:28:27,354 --> 00:28:30,053
Through Bo Gum,

774
00:28:30,054 --> 00:28:31,923
I get something from a brand.

775
00:28:31,924 --> 00:28:33,323
Bo Gum is the ambassador,

776
00:28:33,324 --> 00:28:35,664
and we can get a discount through him.

777
00:28:35,824 --> 00:28:36,833
- For real?
- Wait.

778
00:28:36,834 --> 00:28:38,493
- Just say it outright.
- Which brand?

779
00:28:38,494 --> 00:28:39,603
- Stop hesitating.
- Get...

780
00:28:39,604 --> 00:28:41,133
Get permission from Bo Gum later on.

781
00:28:41,134 --> 00:28:42,303
It's Celine.

782
00:28:42,304 --> 00:28:43,574
(Bo Gum is the ambassador for Brand C.)

783
00:28:43,774 --> 00:28:45,274
- If you need it...
- How much is the discount?

784
00:28:45,804 --> 00:28:48,873
How much is the discount?

785
00:28:48,874 --> 00:28:50,643
Come on, that's a bit...

786
00:28:50,644 --> 00:28:52,374
- Let me get some too.
- It's just...

787
00:28:52,684 --> 00:28:54,483
What's Celine? A fashion brand?

788
00:28:54,484 --> 00:28:56,484
- It's a fashion brand.
- Is that so?

789
00:28:56,754 --> 00:29:00,024
I contact Bo Gum all the time.

790
00:29:00,084 --> 00:29:03,494
And every time I do, he takes great care of me.

791
00:29:03,894 --> 00:29:05,024
I'm sorry.

792
00:29:05,654 --> 00:29:06,793
But do you mind putting this down?

793
00:29:06,794 --> 00:29:09,293
It holds bad memories.

794
00:29:09,294 --> 00:29:11,333
I've been hit by it many times. Please put it away.

795
00:29:11,334 --> 00:29:13,634
It feels perfect in my hand.

796
00:29:13,734 --> 00:29:15,634
To even bring your cane.

797
00:29:16,074 --> 00:29:17,573
Isn't that what you wore in the drama?

798
00:29:17,574 --> 00:29:19,003
I've got several at my house.

799
00:29:19,004 --> 00:29:20,073
How interesting.

800
00:29:20,074 --> 00:29:21,243
Most of my clothes are like this.

801
00:29:21,244 --> 00:29:22,443
(No one has changed in the last 10 years.)

802
00:29:22,444 --> 00:29:23,874
- Oh, my gosh.
- Cool.

803
00:29:24,674 --> 00:29:27,584
(During Ssangmun High School's supervisor days)

804
00:29:28,984 --> 00:29:32,214
(What's the difference from 10 minutes ago?)

805
00:29:33,454 --> 00:29:35,324
Is your outfit from the drama, Moo Sung?

806
00:29:35,854 --> 00:29:37,023
- It's similar.
- Gosh.

807
00:29:37,024 --> 00:29:38,224
- Yes, it's similar.
- Right?

808
00:29:39,664 --> 00:29:41,064
It's cold.

809
00:29:42,224 --> 00:29:44,563
(That very scene where he calmly proposed)

810
00:29:44,564 --> 00:29:48,264
How about we live together?

811
00:29:50,274 --> 00:29:52,673
(Even Sun Young, who got proposed to,)

812
00:29:52,674 --> 00:29:54,543
I remember.

813
00:29:54,544 --> 00:29:55,673
(is the same as 10 years ago.)

814
00:29:55,674 --> 00:29:56,774
I remember back then.

815
00:29:57,474 --> 00:30:00,284
Everyone looks a lot better now.

816
00:30:00,344 --> 00:30:01,744
- When it's been ten years, right?
- Yes.

817
00:30:02,114 --> 00:30:03,153
- No one has changed.
- It's been...

818
00:30:03,154 --> 00:30:04,513
- exactly 10 years, right?
- It's been 10 years.

819
00:30:04,514 --> 00:30:06,423
- Is that a wig?
- No, it's my actual hair.

820
00:30:06,424 --> 00:30:08,284
- Is that so?
- Yes, this is my hair.

821
00:30:08,754 --> 00:30:10,153
I came dressed like this.

822
00:30:10,154 --> 00:30:11,994
(Even Kyung Pyo is the same as 10 years ago.)

823
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:13,924
Bo Ra.

824
00:30:14,224 --> 00:30:15,464
Bo Ra isn't here.

825
00:30:16,334 --> 00:30:17,594
Where did she go?

826
00:30:17,934 --> 00:30:20,564
(Back when all he asked for was Bo Ra)

827
00:30:21,504 --> 00:30:23,234
Bo Gum has a wig on.

828
00:30:23,274 --> 00:30:24,674
- Bo Gum's is a wig.
- Yes.

829
00:30:25,174 --> 00:30:26,704
- It looks real.
- Really?

830
00:30:27,544 --> 00:30:30,013
The drama that I'm reminded of when it comes to winter...

831
00:30:30,014 --> 00:30:31,743
is "Reply 1988."

832
00:30:31,744 --> 00:30:35,043
I remember Taek, who wore coats,

833
00:30:35,044 --> 00:30:36,684
so I came wearing one.

834
00:30:37,184 --> 00:30:40,654
(One winter day in the alleyway of Ssangmun-dong)

835
00:30:41,784 --> 00:30:43,794
Walk with your shoulders open.

836
00:30:44,424 --> 00:30:45,554
Keep your head up too.

837
00:30:45,694 --> 00:30:47,794
(When he lifts his head,)

838
00:30:48,164 --> 00:30:50,734
(they look more alike.)

839
00:30:51,064 --> 00:30:52,693
- I see.
- We two should have also...

840
00:30:52,694 --> 00:30:54,434
I know, right?

841
00:30:54,604 --> 00:30:55,933
But neither of us wore...

842
00:30:55,934 --> 00:30:58,433
such normal clothes during our shoot.

843
00:30:58,434 --> 00:31:00,004
I only wore the school uniform.

844
00:31:00,174 --> 00:31:03,573
(Even now and back then, all he wore was...)

845
00:31:03,574 --> 00:31:05,343
After the shoot,

846
00:31:05,344 --> 00:31:07,543
- What is that?
- I was given this setup...

847
00:31:07,544 --> 00:31:08,783
- You were gifted.
- Nice.

848
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:10,213
- I see.
- from the wardrobe team,

849
00:31:10,214 --> 00:31:11,653
kept it at my house,

850
00:31:11,654 --> 00:31:12,923
and brought it today.

851
00:31:12,924 --> 00:31:14,623
So it's from the wardrobe team.

852
00:31:14,624 --> 00:31:16,953
- I begged them.
- I should've asked for something.

853
00:31:16,954 --> 00:31:18,053
Right? We had a bunch of props.

854
00:31:18,054 --> 00:31:19,924
- There were so many pretty ones.
- You could've taken some.

855
00:31:20,464 --> 00:31:23,293
Not long ago, I moved to a new place.

856
00:31:23,294 --> 00:31:26,134
And during the move, I found this.

857
00:31:26,504 --> 00:31:28,564
I was determined to bring it today.

858
00:31:28,764 --> 00:31:31,673
It's the commemorative soundtracks.

859
00:31:31,674 --> 00:31:33,543
The original soundtracks.

860
00:31:33,544 --> 00:31:34,643
It's packed with classics.

861
00:31:34,644 --> 00:31:36,744
"Don't Worry," "Hyehwa-dong,"

862
00:31:36,874 --> 00:31:38,843
"As Time Goes By," "Let's Forget It,"

863
00:31:38,844 --> 00:31:40,543
- and "Violet Fragrance." - "Violet Fragrance."

864
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:42,144
- "Everyday with You." - "Everyday with You."

865
00:31:42,244 --> 00:31:44,354
Gosh, these are all classics.

866
00:31:45,754 --> 00:31:47,024
It's that song for me.

867
00:31:47,284 --> 00:31:51,153
(All the things I confessed to you on that drunken night)

868
00:31:51,154 --> 00:31:54,694
Yes, that song. I loved it too.

869
00:31:55,894 --> 00:31:58,194
As for me, I also like "A Little Girl."

870
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:01,763
Either way, I like doing nothing...

871
00:32:01,764 --> 00:32:04,804
with some music on days I'm quite emotional.

872
00:32:05,334 --> 00:32:06,343
I remember...

873
00:32:06,344 --> 00:32:07,943
- when we took that photo.
- Right?

874
00:32:07,944 --> 00:32:10,413
- We were all at the set to take...
- Yes.

875
00:32:10,414 --> 00:32:11,873
- that photo.
- With the background.

876
00:32:11,874 --> 00:32:14,513
It was my first-ever...

877
00:32:14,514 --> 00:32:17,013
poster photoshoot in my entire life.

878
00:32:17,014 --> 00:32:18,813
A poster for a work.

879
00:32:18,814 --> 00:32:19,883
It must have been memorable.

880
00:32:19,884 --> 00:32:21,853
That's why, when we were taking that,

881
00:32:21,854 --> 00:32:25,124
I was like, "I better get in character for this poster."

882
00:32:25,594 --> 00:32:27,163
"Then I shall pose like this."

883
00:32:27,164 --> 00:32:30,434
That's me acting a bit.

884
00:32:31,934 --> 00:32:33,164
I can tell.

885
00:32:34,034 --> 00:32:37,074
Being on a poster is something incredible.

886
00:32:37,434 --> 00:32:40,944
(10 years ago at the poster photoshoot site)

887
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:44,814
(Sun Young's first-ever poster photoshoot)

888
00:32:45,344 --> 00:32:47,414
(Acting like Sun Woo's mom)

889
00:32:47,544 --> 00:32:48,643
(Reply 1988)

890
00:32:48,644 --> 00:32:51,784
(Thanks to their acting, a lively poster was created.)

891
00:32:52,114 --> 00:32:53,783
- This tumbler.
- Gosh.

892
00:32:53,784 --> 00:32:56,453
- I remember.
- Since I'm holding a broomstick,

893
00:32:56,454 --> 00:32:59,053
- it must be Sun Young and me.
- Correct.

894
00:32:59,054 --> 00:33:00,524
Did you lose the lid?

895
00:33:01,064 --> 00:33:02,094
It...

896
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:04,034
I couldn't find it all of a sudden.

897
00:33:04,564 --> 00:33:07,103
(The lid ran away.)

898
00:33:07,104 --> 00:33:08,134
That's it.

899
00:33:08,234 --> 00:33:10,904
- Carry on with yours.
- As for me...

900
00:33:11,274 --> 00:33:14,344
- It's what I wore as Taek.
- Right.

901
00:33:14,604 --> 00:33:17,474
I still have the hoodie I wore back then.

902
00:33:17,674 --> 00:33:20,614
Is it called underclothing? I have this T-shirt.

903
00:33:20,744 --> 00:33:23,113
It's a "Taek" hat that a fan gave me.

904
00:33:23,114 --> 00:33:24,853
I have the 1988 hat too.

905
00:33:24,854 --> 00:33:25,883
Good.

906
00:33:25,884 --> 00:33:27,354
He even has a newspaper.

907
00:33:28,284 --> 00:33:29,923
The newspaper from back then.

908
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:31,423
So you still have that newspaper...

909
00:33:31,424 --> 00:33:33,624
of Choi Taek reaching nine-dan.

910
00:33:34,394 --> 00:33:35,693
- This is my autograph.
- Right.

911
00:33:35,694 --> 00:33:37,564
- This right here is Taek's.
- That one? I see.

912
00:33:37,734 --> 00:33:39,393
You made Choi Taek's autograph...

913
00:33:39,394 --> 00:33:41,603
and signed it, right?

914
00:33:41,604 --> 00:33:43,234
Goodness, that's cool.

915
00:33:43,734 --> 00:33:45,473
It's not a physical one...

916
00:33:45,474 --> 00:33:47,843
as I couldn't bring it due to my other shoot.

917
00:33:47,844 --> 00:33:50,043
This is a snowball...

918
00:33:50,044 --> 00:33:52,674
of Sun Woo and Bo Ra together.

919
00:33:53,284 --> 00:33:55,983
Some fans loved us...

920
00:33:55,984 --> 00:33:58,053
- and nicknamed us "Sun Bo Ra." - "Sun Bo Ra."

921
00:33:58,054 --> 00:34:00,354
You remember the German bakery?

922
00:34:00,484 --> 00:34:02,523
The fans made miniature versions...

923
00:34:02,524 --> 00:34:05,424
of Sun Woo and Bo Ra out of clay.

924
00:34:05,624 --> 00:34:07,223
That's really pretty.

925
00:34:07,224 --> 00:34:08,963
Right? I couldn't throw it away.

926
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:10,233
It would have been great if you brought them.

927
00:34:10,234 --> 00:34:11,434
I know, right?

928
00:34:11,894 --> 00:34:14,103
(A short break)

929
00:34:14,104 --> 00:34:16,534
Is this how you do it?

930
00:34:16,904 --> 00:34:18,004
Yes.

931
00:34:18,574 --> 00:34:22,874
It's his 1st variety show in 10 years.

932
00:34:23,844 --> 00:34:25,273
- This is all...
- There are many cameras.

933
00:34:25,274 --> 00:34:27,944
This is a new scene for him.

934
00:34:28,044 --> 00:34:29,214
There are many cameras.

935
00:34:29,814 --> 00:34:31,653
Thank you for sparing some time for us.

936
00:34:31,654 --> 00:34:32,713
- No.
- Of course.

937
00:34:32,714 --> 00:34:34,554
- We know you're busy.
- No.

938
00:34:35,084 --> 00:34:36,953
- Thank you for preparing this.
- It's not easy to meet up.

939
00:34:36,954 --> 00:34:39,053
I really missed everyone,

940
00:34:39,054 --> 00:34:41,823
- Same here.
- including the other families.

941
00:34:41,824 --> 00:34:42,863
I seriously missed everyone.

942
00:34:42,864 --> 00:34:45,163
But it's hard to meet up if it's not...

943
00:34:45,164 --> 00:34:46,433
for such a situation.

944
00:34:46,434 --> 00:34:47,803
Everyone welcomed it.

945
00:34:47,804 --> 00:34:48,904
Of course.

946
00:34:49,204 --> 00:34:50,474
It's just my mom who's...

947
00:34:51,304 --> 00:34:53,604
(The same joke)

948
00:34:53,774 --> 00:34:55,803
Dong Hwi, I don't know if I should say this,

949
00:34:55,804 --> 00:34:57,343
but I also lost my little sister.

950
00:34:57,344 --> 00:34:59,174
You're right.

951
00:34:59,674 --> 00:35:01,014
Jin Ju is too grown now.

952
00:35:01,844 --> 00:35:05,014
(10 years ago, Jin Ju was 5 years old.)

953
00:35:05,314 --> 00:35:06,383
Gosh.

954
00:35:06,384 --> 00:35:07,623
Goodbye.

955
00:35:07,624 --> 00:35:09,554
(Jin Ju, Sun Woo's once tiny younger sister)

956
00:35:13,824 --> 00:35:17,064
(One day after 10 years)

957
00:35:17,434 --> 00:35:18,564
- Goodness!
- What?

958
00:35:19,494 --> 00:35:22,163
(The special guest who surprised everyone)

959
00:35:22,164 --> 00:35:23,274
- Really?
- Gosh, look who it is.

960
00:35:23,304 --> 00:35:25,634
- Jin Ju?
- Kyung Pyo's little sister is here.

961
00:35:28,444 --> 00:35:30,044
- It's your older brother.
- Greet your older brother.

962
00:35:30,114 --> 00:35:31,274
It's your older brother.

963
00:35:33,614 --> 00:35:35,584
It's like watching a TV show.

964
00:35:35,914 --> 00:35:37,154
Sun Young.

965
00:35:37,684 --> 00:35:38,954
Why are you crying?

966
00:35:39,454 --> 00:35:41,253
(The one who brought the entire set in tears)

967
00:35:41,254 --> 00:35:42,754
- Kyung Pyo is crying as well.
- He's crying.

968
00:35:44,454 --> 00:35:45,523
Come on.

969
00:35:45,524 --> 00:35:47,763
I never even imagined it.

970
00:35:47,764 --> 00:35:50,194
(An unimaginable encounter comes their way.)

971
00:35:51,534 --> 00:35:53,034
(Coming back...)

972
00:35:53,164 --> 00:35:56,674
Now, you will have to head to Goseong.

973
00:35:57,104 --> 00:35:58,674
But before you go,

974
00:35:58,774 --> 00:36:00,543
it won't be fun if you just go.

975
00:36:00,544 --> 00:36:01,743
- Why? It's fun to just go.
- What is it?

976
00:36:01,744 --> 00:36:03,914
No, it's no fun if you just go.

977
00:36:04,544 --> 00:36:06,213
You won't make us skip lunch, will you?

978
00:36:06,214 --> 00:36:07,514
Is it skipping lunch?

979
00:36:07,614 --> 00:36:09,314
Then we should fill up now.

980
00:36:09,384 --> 00:36:12,353
I think we should eat more of this.

981
00:36:12,354 --> 00:36:14,353
Drink this up.

982
00:36:14,354 --> 00:36:15,484
Fill up before we leave.

983
00:36:15,654 --> 00:36:18,153
Your outfits, the drama itself,

984
00:36:18,154 --> 00:36:20,223
and even this very space here...

985
00:36:20,224 --> 00:36:21,423
You are all...

986
00:36:21,424 --> 00:36:23,534
still trapped in 1988.

987
00:36:24,064 --> 00:36:25,434
(Stifling a laugh)

988
00:36:25,594 --> 00:36:28,434
(Looking around)

989
00:36:28,864 --> 00:36:30,674
There are electric cars outside.

990
00:36:31,334 --> 00:36:33,473
(Loving it)

991
00:36:33,474 --> 00:36:34,574
But we're trapped?

992
00:36:34,774 --> 00:36:36,643
(Let's focus back.)

993
00:36:36,644 --> 00:36:39,044
So, what I want to say is...

994
00:36:40,044 --> 00:36:41,844
We will play a very simple game...

995
00:36:41,944 --> 00:36:44,053
to prove that you are not from 1988,

996
00:36:44,054 --> 00:36:46,823
and that you are living in the modern world,

997
00:36:46,824 --> 00:36:47,853
and if you succeed...

998
00:36:47,854 --> 00:36:49,453
You will be able to change...

999
00:36:49,454 --> 00:36:52,724
into your comfortable clothes from your current costume.

1000
00:36:53,094 --> 00:36:55,224
If you fail, you will keep that costume on.

1001
00:36:56,194 --> 00:36:57,263
(What?)

1002
00:36:57,264 --> 00:36:58,794
I'm quite comfortable now.

1003
00:36:58,894 --> 00:37:00,404
- I like this outfit better.
- You look so comfortable.

1004
00:37:00,834 --> 00:37:01,933
I like this better.

1005
00:37:01,934 --> 00:37:03,633
We're all comfortable.

1006
00:37:03,634 --> 00:37:05,873
It doesn't matter if you keep that outfit on.

1007
00:37:05,874 --> 00:37:07,273
The problem is...

1008
00:37:07,274 --> 00:37:08,603
You need to eat lunch, right?

1009
00:37:08,604 --> 00:37:10,413
While you're heading to Goseong,

1010
00:37:10,414 --> 00:37:13,044
you will have to eat lunch at a rest stop.

1011
00:37:13,074 --> 00:37:15,244
If you succeed with the game,

1012
00:37:15,444 --> 00:37:17,053
we will pay you based on today's cost of living.

1013
00:37:17,054 --> 00:37:18,314
- What?
- Okay.

1014
00:37:18,584 --> 00:37:20,853
If you want to eat and have some coffee,

1015
00:37:20,854 --> 00:37:22,383
you will need more than ten dollars per person.

1016
00:37:22,384 --> 00:37:24,294
- About 20 dollars per person.
- Gosh.

1017
00:37:24,494 --> 00:37:26,563
- It's so expensive to eat out.
- Yes.

1018
00:37:26,564 --> 00:37:28,424
- We will give you 100 dollars.
- Okay.

1019
00:37:28,694 --> 00:37:30,734
But if you fail, the amount will be...

1020
00:37:31,034 --> 00:37:34,664
based on the cost of living of 1988.

1021
00:37:36,234 --> 00:37:39,134
- If we fail?
- The cost of living back then?

1022
00:37:40,044 --> 00:37:41,704
- Gosh.
- That means it's a dollar.

1023
00:37:41,944 --> 00:37:44,344
- A sausage costs four dollars.
- I know.

1024
00:37:44,444 --> 00:37:46,274
- You're right.
- Rest stops are expensive.

1025
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:47,883
Back in 1988,

1026
00:37:47,884 --> 00:37:50,013
do you know how much a bowl of jajangmyeon cost?

1027
00:37:50,014 --> 00:37:51,213
- It's 30 cents.
- Or 40 cents?

1028
00:37:51,214 --> 00:37:52,214
No.

1029
00:37:52,215 --> 00:37:53,524
Isn't it less than a dollar?

1030
00:37:53,554 --> 00:37:55,224
- It's 50 cents.
- Or 80 cents?

1031
00:37:55,654 --> 00:37:58,593
Back in 1988, a bowl of jajangmyeon in average...

1032
00:37:58,594 --> 00:37:59,724
- cost 70 cents.
- Gosh.

1033
00:38:00,324 --> 00:38:02,494
But a cup of coffee was 50 cents.

1034
00:38:03,764 --> 00:38:06,033
So, it's about 1.5 dollars.

1035
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:07,463
But that's too stingy,

1036
00:38:07,464 --> 00:38:08,763
so we will be generous,

1037
00:38:08,764 --> 00:38:10,504
and give you 2 dollars each. So, 10 dollars in total.

1038
00:38:10,934 --> 00:38:12,633
- A total of ten dollars for us?
- Yes.

1039
00:38:12,634 --> 00:38:13,803
A total of ten dollars?

1040
00:38:13,804 --> 00:38:15,674
You are 6, so it will be 12 dollars for you.

1041
00:38:15,774 --> 00:38:18,414
We need to have a meal with that?

1042
00:38:18,644 --> 00:38:20,184
That's a lot. Not bad.

1043
00:38:21,084 --> 00:38:22,214
It's ten dollars.

1044
00:38:22,544 --> 00:38:25,014
We can go to the convenience store at the rest stop.

1045
00:38:25,654 --> 00:38:27,254
They have packaged bread there.

1046
00:38:27,354 --> 00:38:29,153
Or we can each buy one...

1047
00:38:29,154 --> 00:38:30,523
and have a bite each.

1048
00:38:30,524 --> 00:38:31,653
You can have it all.

1049
00:38:31,654 --> 00:38:32,654
(Hooray)

1050
00:38:32,655 --> 00:38:34,194
You have become really positive.

1051
00:38:34,364 --> 00:38:35,723
Yes, she has become positive.

1052
00:38:35,724 --> 00:38:37,433
- She only lives today.
- Yes.

1053
00:38:37,434 --> 00:38:39,394
We can still eat, no matter what.

1054
00:38:39,904 --> 00:38:41,834
It's a simple game, called...

1055
00:38:41,904 --> 00:38:43,674
I will tell you the game.

1056
00:38:43,804 --> 00:38:44,904
Now...

1057
00:38:45,704 --> 00:38:48,373
May we reveal the game that will decide...

1058
00:38:48,374 --> 00:38:50,213
the fate of your family?

1059
00:38:50,214 --> 00:38:51,444
- Yes.
- Yes.

1060
00:38:51,544 --> 00:38:54,184
It's a game we recently played in "Earth Arcade."

1061
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:58,113
We will play Reverse Perfect Pitch.

1062
00:38:58,114 --> 00:38:59,253
- What?
- What is that?

1063
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:00,754
Do you know what having perfect pitch is?

1064
00:39:00,954 --> 00:39:03,253
This was so hard.

1065
00:39:03,254 --> 00:39:04,994
- It's going the opposite.
- It's the opposite.

1066
00:39:05,224 --> 00:39:06,553
Show us the demonstration.

1067
00:39:06,554 --> 00:39:09,123
Usually, it goes, Reply.

1068
00:39:09,124 --> 00:39:10,863

00:39:12,464 --> 00:39:14,003
- Reply - Reply, right?

1071
00:39:14,004 --> 00:39:15,933
For this, you reverse it.

1072
00:39:15,934 --> 00:39:17,133
- Reverse it.
- Now, it's...

1073
00:39:17,134 --> 00:39:18,674

00:39:20,074 --> 00:39:22,044

1075
00:39:22,374 --> 00:39:24,413
- What is...
- Reply.

1076
00:39:24,414 --> 00:39:25,944
- Reply.
- What is that?

1077
00:39:26,544 --> 00:39:27,883
- I don't get it.
- I don't get it.

1078
00:39:27,884 --> 00:39:29,313
This is so...

1079
00:39:29,314 --> 00:39:30,413
I can't even get the first part.

1080
00:39:30,414 --> 00:39:32,614
- We don't get it.
- Just watch.

1081
00:39:32,684 --> 00:39:33,984
Starting from the first part,

1082
00:39:34,054 --> 00:39:36,424
you stress each letter in order.

1083
00:39:36,484 --> 00:39:37,593
But you do a lower key.

1084
00:39:37,594 --> 00:39:41,093
Reply, reply, reply, reply.

1085
00:39:41,094 --> 00:39:43,024
This is how you do it. Then, you succeed.

1086
00:39:43,194 --> 00:39:45,234

1087
00:39:46,164 --> 00:39:48,933

1088
00:39:48,934 --> 00:39:50,604
Ply.

1089
00:39:50,734 --> 00:39:51,803
(Going on)

1090
00:39:51,804 --> 00:39:53,373
Reply.

1091
00:39:53,374 --> 00:39:54,443
Reply.

1092
00:39:54,444 --> 00:39:55,643
- That's it.
- I got it.

1093
00:39:55,644 --> 00:39:57,074
- You can do it.
- It's a success, right?

1094
00:39:57,174 --> 00:39:58,314
- Yes.
- Do you get it, Dong Il?

1095
00:39:58,414 --> 00:40:00,044
But the problem is,

1096
00:40:00,184 --> 00:40:03,854
we're going to give you a longer word than this.

1097
00:40:04,084 --> 00:40:07,183
And we won't show you the word.

1098
00:40:07,184 --> 00:40:08,584
- Then we need to write it down.
- That will be so hard.

1099
00:40:09,454 --> 00:40:10,693
- Starting with Hye Ri.
- Okay.

1100
00:40:10,694 --> 00:40:12,393
It's one-way.

1101
00:40:12,394 --> 00:40:13,923
- Then we only need to do it once?
- Yes.

1102
00:40:13,924 --> 00:40:15,263
You get 20 seconds each.

1103
00:40:15,264 --> 00:40:16,423
So, 100 seconds in total.

1104
00:40:16,424 --> 00:40:17,533
I'm giving you enough time.

1105
00:40:17,534 --> 00:40:18,664
Just 100 seconds?

1106
00:40:19,234 --> 00:40:20,304
It's long.

1107
00:40:20,364 --> 00:40:21,704
(Laughing)

1108
00:40:22,334 --> 00:40:24,333
- She got the right character today.
- An icon of positivity.

1109
00:40:24,334 --> 00:40:25,673
- We can do it, for sure.
- How cute.

1110
00:40:25,674 --> 00:40:26,803
We can do it.

1111
00:40:26,804 --> 00:40:28,544
We can do it quickly and give them more time.

1112
00:40:29,044 --> 00:40:31,373
I think they will be better than you.

1113
00:40:31,374 --> 00:40:32,473
You're right.

1114
00:40:32,474 --> 00:40:34,183
- We saw her do it.
- You're right.

1115
00:40:34,184 --> 00:40:35,684
But the problem is,

1116
00:40:35,744 --> 00:40:37,653
if Hye Ri succeeds,

1117
00:40:37,654 --> 00:40:39,814
- but Dong Il fails, - Yes.

1118
00:40:39,884 --> 00:40:41,924
then you have to start over.

1119
00:40:42,454 --> 00:40:44,754
- Should we change seats?
- Let's switch.

1120
00:40:45,154 --> 00:40:48,664
(They send the weakest one to the end.)

1121
00:40:48,894 --> 00:40:51,433
And we're also going to give you five chances.

1122
00:40:51,434 --> 00:40:52,833
So you only need to succeed within five attempts.

1123
00:40:52,834 --> 00:40:53,834
Okay.

1124
00:40:54,404 --> 00:40:56,234
Let's hype ourselves up before we start.

1125
00:40:56,304 --> 00:40:57,374
Should we...

1126
00:40:57,404 --> 00:40:58,934
"Let's go, Sung Family." Should we do that?

1127
00:40:59,004 --> 00:41:00,173
One, two, three.

1128
00:41:00,174 --> 00:41:02,173
- Let's go, Sung Family!
- Let's go, Sung Family!

1129
00:41:02,174 --> 00:41:03,243
Show them like this?

1130
00:41:03,244 --> 00:41:04,414
Show us for ten seconds.

1131
00:41:05,814 --> 00:41:07,413
We will show you for that long.

1132
00:41:07,414 --> 00:41:08,484
- Okay.
- We will show you now.

1133
00:41:08,614 --> 00:41:10,254
- The keyword is...
- I'm nervous.

1134
00:41:12,154 --> 00:41:14,953
Glutinous rice cake, honey rice cake, bean rice cake.

1135
00:41:14,954 --> 00:41:16,084
(The hardest one)

1136
00:41:16,324 --> 00:41:18,824
Glutinous rice cake, honey rice cake, bean rice cake.

1137
00:41:19,324 --> 00:41:20,423
For this,

1138
00:41:20,424 --> 00:41:22,624
it means you don't want to give us the money.

1139
00:41:22,664 --> 00:41:24,794
- Honey rice cake.
- We will begin in three seconds.

1140
00:41:24,864 --> 00:41:26,664
- It's 100 seconds.
- What do we do?

1141
00:41:27,304 --> 00:41:30,203
It's "glutinous rice cake, honey rice cake, bean rice cake."

1142
00:41:30,204 --> 00:41:31,233
It's 100 seconds.

1143
00:41:31,234 --> 00:41:32,404
Start.

1144
00:41:32,504 --> 00:41:34,904
Glutinous rice cake, honey rice cake, bean rice cake.

1145
00:41:35,442 --> 00:41:38,312
It's "glutinous rice cake, honey rice cake, bean rice cake."

1146
00:41:38,442 --> 00:41:40,542
It's 100 seconds. Start.

1147
00:41:40,582 --> 00:41:42,812
Glutinous rice cake, honey rice cake, bean rice cake.

1148
00:41:43,482 --> 00:41:45,881
Glutinous rice cake, honey rice cake, bean rice cake.

1149
00:41:45,882 --> 00:41:48,452
Glutinous rice cake, honey rice cake, bean rice cake.

1150
00:41:48,582 --> 00:41:49,882
Squeeze rice cake...

1151
00:41:50,392 --> 00:41:51,622
- Oh, no.
- Incorrect. Again.

1152
00:41:51,692 --> 00:41:53,221
(He just finds it funny.)

1153
00:41:53,222 --> 00:41:54,392
(He's just worried.)

1154
00:41:54,522 --> 00:41:56,931
Glutinous rice cake, honey rice cake, bean rice cake.

1155
00:41:56,932 --> 00:41:59,162
Glutinous rice cake, honey rice cake, bean rice cake.

1156
00:41:59,192 --> 00:42:01,401
Glutinous rice cake, honey rice cake, bean rice cake.

1157
00:42:01,402 --> 00:42:03,871
Glutinous rice cake, honey rice cake, bean rice cake.

1158
00:42:03,872 --> 00:42:05,631
Glutinous rice cake...

1159
00:42:05,632 --> 00:42:06,702
That's a warning.

1160
00:42:07,002 --> 00:42:08,972
Honey rice cake, bean rice cake.

1161
00:42:09,172 --> 00:42:11,372
Glutinous rice cake, honey rice cake, bean rice cake.

1162
00:42:11,412 --> 00:42:12,612
- Pass.
- Did she pass?

1163
00:42:12,772 --> 00:42:14,182
- II Hwa.
- Why am I nervous?

1164
00:42:14,882 --> 00:42:18,052
Glutinous rice cake, honey rice cake, bean rice cake.

1165
00:42:18,112 --> 00:42:20,982
Glutinous rice cake, honey rice cake, bean rice cake.

1166
00:42:21,122 --> 00:42:25,021
Glutinous rice cake, honey rice cake, bean rice cake.

1167
00:42:25,022 --> 00:42:27,991
Glutinous rice cake, honey rice cake, bean rice cake.

1168
00:42:27,992 --> 00:42:29,222
Wrong.

1169
00:42:30,492 --> 00:42:31,791
(That was close.)

1170
00:42:31,792 --> 00:42:32,861
Wrong.

1171
00:42:32,862 --> 00:42:34,101
Glutinous...

1172
00:42:34,102 --> 00:42:35,562
You got it wrong, Il Hwa.

1173
00:42:35,632 --> 00:42:36,801
- Do we have to start over?
- You have to start over.

1174
00:42:36,802 --> 00:42:37,971
- I'm sorry.
- Glutinous rice cake...

1175
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:39,901
Glutinous rice cake, honey rice cake, bean rice cake.

1176
00:42:39,902 --> 00:42:42,101
Squeeze... Glutinous rice cake, honey rice cake, bean rice cake.

1177
00:42:42,102 --> 00:42:45,342
Squeeze... Glutinous rice cake, honey rice cake, bean rice cake.

1178
00:42:45,472 --> 00:42:47,641
Squeeze... Glutinous rice cake...

1179
00:42:47,642 --> 00:42:48,781
It's not "squeeze."

1180
00:42:48,782 --> 00:42:50,251
(She has said it 3 times.)

1181
00:42:50,252 --> 00:42:53,521
Glutinous rice cake, honey rice cake, bump cake.

1182
00:42:53,522 --> 00:42:55,121
It's not "bump." Incorrect. Again.

1183
00:42:55,122 --> 00:42:56,681
Gosh, this is so hard.

1184
00:42:56,682 --> 00:42:58,021
- Hye Young.
- You passed earlier.

1185
00:42:58,022 --> 00:43:00,051
- I can't do it. Wait.
- I'll try.

1186
00:43:00,052 --> 00:43:01,292
- Is this allowed?
- Let's try.

1187
00:43:01,562 --> 00:43:03,792
(Go that way, youngest one.)

1188
00:43:04,132 --> 00:43:06,431
(Go further, youngest one.)

1189
00:43:06,432 --> 00:43:07,661
(She has already started.)

1190
00:43:07,662 --> 00:43:08,732
- Honey rice cake.
- Change with Mom.

1191
00:43:09,532 --> 00:43:12,371
Glutinous rice cake, honey rice cake, bean rice cake.

1192
00:43:12,372 --> 00:43:14,871
Glutinous rice cake, honey rice cake, bean rice cake.

1193
00:43:14,872 --> 00:43:17,141
Glutinous rice cake, honey rice cake, bean rice cake.

1194
00:43:17,142 --> 00:43:19,311
Glutinous rice cake, honey rice cake, bean rice cake.

1195
00:43:19,312 --> 00:43:21,412
Glutinous rice cake, honey rice cake, bean rice cake.

1196
00:43:21,482 --> 00:43:22,811
- Yes, you passed.
- Glutinous...

1197
00:43:22,812 --> 00:43:23,951
- rice cake, - You can't use your hands.

1198
00:43:23,952 --> 00:43:25,552
(They can't use their hands anymore.)

1199
00:43:25,782 --> 00:43:28,122
Glutinous rice cake, honey rice cake, bean rice cake.

1200
00:43:28,182 --> 00:43:29,381
Glutinous fall...

1201
00:43:29,382 --> 00:43:30,452
Incorrect.

1202
00:43:31,522 --> 00:43:32,651
(Screaming)

1203
00:43:32,652 --> 00:43:34,361
(Focusing again)

1204
00:43:34,362 --> 00:43:35,561
Glutinous rice cake, honey rice cake, bean rice cake.

1205
00:43:35,562 --> 00:43:37,332
Glutinous rice cake, bump rice cake...

1206
00:43:37,492 --> 00:43:38,531
Incorrect. You were wrong.

1207
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:40,431
Your 100 seconds are up. You failed.

1208
00:43:40,432 --> 00:43:42,002
- That was so hard.
- It's hard.

1209
00:43:42,102 --> 00:43:43,872
I'm sure my turn won't come.

1210
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:46,271
I feel much more comfortable now.

1211
00:43:46,272 --> 00:43:47,302
(Dong Il is about to give up.)

1212
00:43:47,502 --> 00:43:49,201
Glutinous rice cake, honey rice cake, bean rice cake.

1213
00:43:49,202 --> 00:43:50,411
I can't get it, no matter how many times I try.

1214
00:43:50,412 --> 00:43:51,571
Right.

1215
00:43:51,572 --> 00:43:54,281
- But you haven't tried yet, right?
- No.

1216
00:43:54,282 --> 00:43:55,482
You should give it a try.

1217
00:43:55,642 --> 00:43:58,312
Glutinous rice cake, honey rice cake, bean rice cake.

1218
00:43:58,382 --> 00:44:01,582
Glutinous rice cake, honey rice cake, bean rice cake.

1219
00:44:02,382 --> 00:44:04,752
(Their heads all fall together.)

1220
00:44:04,852 --> 00:44:07,391
Glutinous rice cake, honey rice cake, bean rice cake.

1221
00:44:07,392 --> 00:44:10,362
Glutinous rice cake, honey rice cake, bean rice cake.

1222
00:44:10,492 --> 00:44:13,162
Glutinous rice cake, honey rice cake, bean rice cake.

1223
00:44:13,262 --> 00:44:15,762
Glutinous rice cake, honey rice cake, bean rice cake.

1224
00:44:16,302 --> 00:44:17,302
(Did you see that?)

1225
00:44:17,303 --> 00:44:18,871
- That's not too bad.
- He's good.

1226
00:44:18,872 --> 00:44:19,872
- Pass?
- That's not bad.

1227
00:44:19,873 --> 00:44:21,241
- You should go first, Dad.
- You should be first.

1228
00:44:21,242 --> 00:44:22,942
No way. I can't be seen like this.

1229
00:44:23,172 --> 00:44:24,372
You're the dad.

1230
00:44:24,612 --> 00:44:26,371
- You're the dad.
- Yes.

1231
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:27,441
"You're the dad?"

1232
00:44:27,442 --> 00:44:28,582
(A shy grin)

1233
00:44:28,712 --> 00:44:30,812
It's Dad's first time playing this kind of game.

1234
00:44:33,152 --> 00:44:34,722
That's such a touching line.

1235
00:44:35,122 --> 00:44:36,752
"It's Dad's first time playing this kind of game."

1236
00:44:37,552 --> 00:44:39,152
I will give you the keyword when you are ready.

1237
00:44:39,552 --> 00:44:40,561
It's your second chance.

1238
00:44:40,562 --> 00:44:42,222
- Yes.
- I said I would change it.

1239
00:44:42,562 --> 00:44:44,191
(They warm up their mouths.)

1240
00:44:44,192 --> 00:44:45,361
Yes, the pronunciation is important.

1241
00:44:45,362 --> 00:44:48,132
The pronunciation gets confusing, rather than the intonation.

1242
00:44:48,262 --> 00:44:49,362
The keyword is...

1243
00:44:50,332 --> 00:44:52,432
"Richly sweet chestnut red bean jelly."

1244
00:44:52,732 --> 00:44:54,341
Richly sweet chestnut red bean jelly.

1245
00:44:54,342 --> 00:44:55,672
I can't even say it as is.

1246
00:44:55,902 --> 00:44:57,512
- Richly sweet chestnut...
- Okay?

1247
00:44:57,912 --> 00:44:59,072
It's 100 seconds.

1248
00:44:59,542 --> 00:45:02,242
From Dong Il, start.

1249
00:45:02,482 --> 00:45:04,311
Richly sweet chestnut red bean jelly.

1250
00:45:04,312 --> 00:45:06,211
Richly sweet chestnut red bean jelly.

1251
00:45:06,212 --> 00:45:08,221
Richly sweet chestnut red bean jelly.

1252
00:45:08,222 --> 00:45:10,152
Richly sweet chestnut red bean jelly.

1253
00:45:10,252 --> 00:45:12,622
(Surprising skills)

1254
00:45:12,852 --> 00:45:14,461
Richly sweet chestnut red bean jelly.

1255
00:45:14,462 --> 00:45:16,121
- Success.
- Oh, no.

1256
00:45:16,122 --> 00:45:17,331
- What?
- He's good.

1257
00:45:17,332 --> 00:45:18,961
Richly sweet chestnut red bean jelly.

1258
00:45:18,962 --> 00:45:20,661
Richly sweet chestnut red bean jelly.

1259
00:45:20,662 --> 00:45:22,261
Richly sweet chestnut red bean jelly.

1260
00:45:22,262 --> 00:45:23,831
Richly sweet chestnut red bean jelly.

1261
00:45:23,832 --> 00:45:25,731
Richly sweet chestnut red bean jelly.

1262
00:45:25,732 --> 00:45:27,171
Richly sweet chestnut red bean jelly.

1263
00:45:27,172 --> 00:45:28,202
Success.

1264
00:45:28,472 --> 00:45:30,972
(The father and daughter had good speed.)

1265
00:45:31,112 --> 00:45:33,472
(Now, it's the mom's turn.)

1266
00:45:33,612 --> 00:45:35,541
Richly sweet chestnut red bean jelly.

1267
00:45:35,542 --> 00:45:38,311
Richly sweet chestnut red bean jelly.

1268
00:45:38,312 --> 00:45:40,051
Richly sweet chestnut red bean jelly.

1269
00:45:40,052 --> 00:45:43,282
Richly sweet chestnut red bean jelly.

1270
00:45:43,582 --> 00:45:44,652
Wrong.

1271
00:45:44,922 --> 00:45:46,122
You should have let it slide.

1272
00:45:46,492 --> 00:45:47,791
It's your turn, Dong Il.

1273
00:45:47,792 --> 00:45:49,922
(Displeased)

1274
00:45:50,162 --> 00:45:51,891
Richly sweet chestnut red bean jelly.

1275
00:45:51,892 --> 00:45:53,661
Richly sweet chestnut red bean jelly.

1276
00:45:53,662 --> 00:45:54,731
Richly sweet chestnut red bean jelly.

1277
00:45:54,732 --> 00:45:55,732
He's really good.

1278
00:45:55,733 --> 00:45:56,931
Richly sweet chestnut red bean jelly.

1279
00:45:56,932 --> 00:45:58,331
- Why are you so good?
- Richly sweet chestnut red bean...

1280
00:45:58,332 --> 00:45:59,572
- Why are you so good?
- He's so good.

1281
00:46:00,032 --> 00:46:01,441
He's a machine.

1282
00:46:01,442 --> 00:46:02,741
Richly sweet chestnut red bean jelly.

1283
00:46:02,742 --> 00:46:04,211
Richly sweet chestnut red bean jelly.

1284
00:46:04,212 --> 00:46:05,711
Richly sweet chestnut red bean jelly.

1285
00:46:05,712 --> 00:46:07,111
Richly sweet chestnut red bean jelly.

1286
00:46:07,112 --> 00:46:08,611
Richly sweet chestnut red bean jelly.

1287
00:46:08,612 --> 00:46:09,612
Richly sweet chestnut red bean jelly.

1288
00:46:09,612 --> 00:46:10,612
Success!

1289
00:46:11,482 --> 00:46:13,381
Richly sweet chestnut red bean jelly.

1290
00:46:13,382 --> 00:46:15,051
Richly sweet chestnut red bean jelly.

1291
00:46:15,052 --> 00:46:16,851
Richly sweet chestnut red bean jelly.

1292
00:46:16,852 --> 00:46:17,891
Richly sweet...

1293
00:46:17,892 --> 00:46:18,892
(Stopping)

1294
00:46:19,652 --> 00:46:20,892
(Lowering her head)

1295
00:46:21,192 --> 00:46:22,221
Chestnut red bean jelly.

1296
00:46:22,222 --> 00:46:24,461
Richly sweet chestnut red bean jelly.

1297
00:46:24,462 --> 00:46:26,291
Richly sweet chestnut red bean jelly.

1298
00:46:26,292 --> 00:46:27,361
Correct.

1299
00:46:27,362 --> 00:46:28,931
Richly sweet chestnut red bean jelly.

1300
00:46:28,932 --> 00:46:30,771
Richly sweet chestnut red bean jelly.

1301
00:46:30,772 --> 00:46:32,571
Richly sweet chestnut red bean jelly.

1302
00:46:32,572 --> 00:46:34,441
Richly sweet chestnut red bean jelly.

1303
00:46:34,442 --> 00:46:36,001
Richly sweet chestnut red bean jelly.

1304
00:46:36,002 --> 00:46:37,041
- Richly sweet chestnut red bean...
- Wrong.

1305
00:46:37,042 --> 00:46:38,042
- jelly.
- You're wrong.

1306
00:46:38,072 --> 00:46:39,111
Why?

1307
00:46:39,112 --> 00:46:40,172
(He has no clue.)

1308
00:46:40,242 --> 00:46:41,481
Your 100 seconds are up.

1309
00:46:41,482 --> 00:46:42,712
(And the 100 seconds are up...)

1310
00:46:42,982 --> 00:46:46,451
This time, there really was a chance of success.

1311
00:46:46,452 --> 00:46:47,452
I'm sweating.

1312
00:46:47,453 --> 00:46:49,352
Which part made you...

1313
00:46:49,852 --> 00:46:51,922
I actually don't even know what I got wrong.

1314
00:46:52,492 --> 00:46:54,091
You were wrong at "chestnut."

1315
00:46:54,092 --> 00:46:55,591
- You saw it by his side, right?
- Yes.

1316
00:46:55,592 --> 00:46:56,992
- He was clearly wrong, right?
- Yes.

1317
00:46:57,292 --> 00:46:59,362
(Their second try was also a failure.)

1318
00:46:59,932 --> 00:47:01,562
Should we go? It's your third try.

1319
00:47:01,732 --> 00:47:04,002
(They change seats beforehand.)

1320
00:47:04,402 --> 00:47:06,572
- Dad should be first.
- Will you start, Dong Il?

1321
00:47:06,772 --> 00:47:07,842
- Since you're the best.
- Gosh.

1322
00:47:09,042 --> 00:47:11,441
Since you need to prove...

1323
00:47:11,442 --> 00:47:13,811
that you are living in the modern world,

1324
00:47:13,812 --> 00:47:15,212
I will give you a newly coined word.

1325
00:47:15,742 --> 00:47:17,751
- A newly coined word?
- What would it be?

1326
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:18,911
Heo-geo-deong-geo-deong-seu.

1327
00:47:18,912 --> 00:47:20,552
(The hardest difficulty level)

1328
00:47:20,822 --> 00:47:22,021
- What?
- "Heo-geo-deong-geo-deong-seu?"

1329
00:47:22,022 --> 00:47:23,651
- Do people actually say that?
- Heo-geo-deong.

1330
00:47:23,652 --> 00:47:25,092
- What does that even mean?
- I've never heard of it before.

1331
00:47:25,192 --> 00:47:27,361
Heo-geo-deong. They say that.

1332
00:47:27,362 --> 00:47:29,392
(You can tell that it's his first time using it today.)

1333
00:47:29,862 --> 00:47:31,931
No, I've never heard of it before. I'm serious.

1334
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:33,132
I've never heard that before.

1335
00:47:33,562 --> 00:47:35,362
(They all jeer.)

1336
00:47:35,562 --> 00:47:36,831
I've never heard that before. What about you?

1337
00:47:36,832 --> 00:47:38,071
- Me, too.
- See?

1338
00:47:38,072 --> 00:47:39,831
- Heo-geo-deong.
- We don't know what that means.

1339
00:47:39,832 --> 00:47:41,341
- A different one.
- Yes. Give us something else.

1340
00:47:41,342 --> 00:47:42,541
They want a different one.

1341
00:47:42,542 --> 00:47:45,211
- I don't get what that means.
- He's so funny.

1342
00:47:45,212 --> 00:47:46,212
(Doubtful)

1343
00:47:46,242 --> 00:47:48,142
Then...

1344
00:47:48,842 --> 00:47:50,411
If you two get it within 20 seconds...

1345
00:47:50,412 --> 00:47:51,451
Okay.

1346
00:47:51,452 --> 00:47:52,751
No, even II Hwa.

1347
00:47:52,752 --> 00:47:54,482
If you get it within 30 seconds, I will let you finish.

1348
00:47:54,582 --> 00:47:57,691
(The 3 of them, including Mom, a total of 30 seconds)

1349
00:47:57,692 --> 00:47:58,692
- Sounds good.
- Really?

1350
00:47:58,693 --> 00:48:00,451
Hey, but...

1351
00:48:00,452 --> 00:48:02,421
It's 3-5th. Why is it 30 seconds?

1352
00:48:02,422 --> 00:48:04,131
(She is right!)

1353
00:48:04,132 --> 00:48:06,332
Bo Ra is a Seoul National University student, for sure.

1354
00:48:06,462 --> 00:48:07,931
Three-fifths...

1355
00:48:07,932 --> 00:48:09,801
out of 100 seconds is...

1356
00:48:09,802 --> 00:48:10,901
You should give us 60 seconds.

1357
00:48:10,902 --> 00:48:12,431
Sixty seconds?

1358
00:48:12,432 --> 00:48:13,432
Bo Ra is a Seoul National University student, for sure.

1359
00:48:13,433 --> 00:48:14,601
Let's go.

1360
00:48:14,602 --> 00:48:16,271
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1361
00:48:16,272 --> 00:48:17,341
It's the challenge of the mom...

1362
00:48:17,342 --> 00:48:18,372
- and two daughters.
- I'll go first.

1363
00:48:18,442 --> 00:48:20,111
- Mom and daughters, let's go.
- Let's go.

1364
00:48:20,112 --> 00:48:21,112
Let's go.

1365
00:48:21,113 --> 00:48:22,612
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1366
00:48:23,042 --> 00:48:24,751
The challenge of the mom and two daughters.

1367
00:48:24,752 --> 00:48:26,152
It's "heo-geo-deong-geo-deong-seu."

1368
00:48:26,312 --> 00:48:28,651
It's 2, 4, and 6. It's 60 seconds.

1369
00:48:28,652 --> 00:48:29,821
(The time limit is 60 seconds.)

1370
00:48:29,822 --> 00:48:31,891
We will start with II Hwa. "Heo-geo-deong-geo-deong-seu."

1371
00:48:31,892 --> 00:48:34,092
Get ready, and start.

1372
00:48:34,322 --> 00:48:36,021
Heo-geo-deong-geo-deong-seu.

1373
00:48:36,022 --> 00:48:37,531
Heo-geo-deong-geo-deong-seu.

1374
00:48:37,532 --> 00:48:39,391
Heo-geo-deong-geo-deong-seu.

1375
00:48:39,392 --> 00:48:41,302
Heo-geo-deong-geo...

1376
00:48:41,332 --> 00:48:42,332
Wrong. Again.

1377
00:48:42,333 --> 00:48:44,402
Heo-geo-deong-geo-deong-seu.

1378
00:48:44,602 --> 00:48:46,472
Heo-geo-deong-geo-deong-seu.

1379
00:48:46,672 --> 00:48:48,771
Heo-geo-deong-geo-deong-seu.

1380
00:48:48,772 --> 00:48:50,571
Heo-geo-deong-geo-deong-seu.

1381
00:48:50,572 --> 00:48:52,671
Heo-geo-deong-geo-deong-seu.

1382
00:48:52,672 --> 00:48:55,081
Heo-geo-deong-geo-deong-seu.

1383
00:48:55,082 --> 00:48:56,142
Pass.

1384
00:48:56,312 --> 00:48:57,881
Heo-geo-deong-geo-deong-seu.

1385
00:48:57,882 --> 00:48:59,481
- Heo-geo-deong-geo-deong-seu.
- Don't get excited.

1386
00:48:59,482 --> 00:49:01,151
- Slowly.
- Heo-geo-deong-geo-deong-seu.

1387
00:49:01,152 --> 00:49:02,781
Heo-geo-deong-geo-deong-seu.

1388
00:49:02,782 --> 00:49:04,451
Heo-geo-deong-geo-deong-seu.

1389
00:49:04,452 --> 00:49:06,592
- Heo-geo-deong-geo-deong-seu.
- Pass.

1390
00:49:06,722 --> 00:49:08,421
Heo-geo-deong-geo-deong-seu.

1391
00:49:08,422 --> 00:49:09,921
Heo-geo-deong-geo-deong-seu.

1392
00:49:09,922 --> 00:49:11,361
Heo-geo-deong-geo-deong-seu.

1393
00:49:11,362 --> 00:49:12,731
Heo-geo-deong-geo-deong-seu.

1394
00:49:12,732 --> 00:49:14,031
Heo-geo-deong-geo-deong-seu.

1395
00:49:14,032 --> 00:49:15,402
Heo-geo-deong-geo-deong-seu.

1396
00:49:15,432 --> 00:49:16,902
(They all pass.)

1397
00:49:17,162 --> 00:49:18,602
(Mouth open wide)

1398
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:20,202
(Screaming)

1399
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:21,441
Did we get it?

1400
00:49:21,442 --> 00:49:22,641
(The total time was...)

1401
00:49:22,642 --> 00:49:24,412
(It was 39 seconds!)

1402
00:49:24,712 --> 00:49:25,741
Success.

1403
00:49:25,742 --> 00:49:28,142
(The mom and daughters succeeded.)

1404
00:49:28,582 --> 00:49:31,312
(Touched)

1405
00:49:31,412 --> 00:49:32,881
It's 100 dollars.

1406
00:49:32,882 --> 00:49:35,221
- It's 100 dollars.
- This was the hardest one.

1407
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:36,222
"Heo-geo-deong-geo-deong-seu."

1408
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:37,292
- Really?
- Really?

1409
00:49:37,722 --> 00:49:39,221
But Mom was so good.

1410
00:49:39,222 --> 00:49:40,821
- You're the best, Mom.
- II Hwa,

1411
00:49:40,822 --> 00:49:42,492
you especially did a good job.

1412
00:49:42,892 --> 00:49:43,892
(He gives the award directly to the mom.)

1413
00:49:43,893 --> 00:49:44,931
Congratulations.

1414
00:49:44,932 --> 00:49:46,161
We're saved.

1415
00:49:46,162 --> 00:49:47,832
(They can get changed, and they won 100 dollars.)

1416
00:49:47,932 --> 00:49:49,902
- You should try, Dad.
- Yes, you should try.

1417
00:49:50,062 --> 00:49:51,301
I will get the energy after seeing the money.

1418
00:49:51,302 --> 00:49:53,071
(He carefully checks the money.)

1419
00:49:53,072 --> 00:49:54,172
- Now...
- Forget the past.

1420
00:49:55,172 --> 00:49:56,601
With this at stake,

1421
00:49:56,602 --> 00:49:59,272
- What do you mean?
- the two of us will get 30 seconds,

1422
00:49:59,342 --> 00:50:01,881
and if we fail, we will return this,

1423
00:50:01,882 --> 00:50:03,711
but if we succeed, why don't you give us 100 dollars more?

1424
00:50:03,712 --> 00:50:04,812
(Extra 100 dollars)

1425
00:50:05,112 --> 00:50:06,551
- The 2 of you? In 30 seconds?
- In 30 seconds?

1426
00:50:06,552 --> 00:50:07,581
- In 30 seconds.
- In 30 seconds.

1427
00:50:07,582 --> 00:50:09,781
You have put this money at stake.

1428
00:50:09,782 --> 00:50:11,122
If you succeed, you get twice the amount,

1429
00:50:11,222 --> 00:50:14,322
but if you fail, you only get ten dollars.

1430
00:50:15,092 --> 00:50:16,622
Life is all or none.

1431
00:50:16,992 --> 00:50:18,292
Let's do this.

1432
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:20,031
- He said, "Let's do this." - Gosh.

1433
00:50:20,032 --> 00:50:21,132
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1434
00:50:21,762 --> 00:50:23,632
I will give you the keyword.

1435
00:50:23,762 --> 00:50:25,631
It might be new to you, Dong Il.

1436
00:50:25,632 --> 00:50:26,632
Again?

1437
00:50:28,042 --> 00:50:30,142
- "Hambuggy-buggy-ham." - Hambuggy-buggy-ham.

1438
00:50:31,042 --> 00:50:32,811
"Hambuggy-buggy..."

1439
00:50:32,812 --> 00:50:34,042
- This one is hard.
- Is it the opposite way?

1440
00:50:34,442 --> 00:50:35,582
Now you know, right?

1441
00:50:36,282 --> 00:50:38,181
- Buggy-buggy.
- Let's go it this way.

1442
00:50:38,182 --> 00:50:39,981
Since we're at it, let's add Mom.

1443
00:50:39,982 --> 00:50:41,321
- Yes.
- Let's add Mom.

1444
00:50:41,322 --> 00:50:43,381
- It will be 60 seconds.
- Yes, 60 seconds.

1445
00:50:43,382 --> 00:50:44,751
Good, let's go.

1446
00:50:44,752 --> 00:50:46,192
I was relaxed.

1447
00:50:46,492 --> 00:50:48,192
We will go when you are ready, Dong Il.

1448
00:50:48,592 --> 00:50:50,662
- Are you ready?
- I think "buggy-buggy" is the trap.

1449
00:50:50,732 --> 00:50:52,031
- No, it's easy.
- Is it?

1450
00:50:52,032 --> 00:50:53,662
It's going to help us.

1451
00:50:53,862 --> 00:50:55,732
(Somewhat relieved)

1452
00:50:55,932 --> 00:50:57,801
- You're so positive.
- Thank you, buggy-buggy.

1453
00:50:57,802 --> 00:50:59,002
She said it's helping.

1454
00:50:59,472 --> 00:51:01,301
- I will go.
- Slowly.

1455
00:51:01,302 --> 00:51:02,302
You can do it.

1456
00:51:02,303 --> 00:51:04,211
It will end if even II Hwa succeeds.

1457
00:51:04,212 --> 00:51:06,472
- How many seconds?
- It's 60 seconds.

1458
00:51:06,842 --> 00:51:08,312
We will start with Dong Il.

1459
00:51:08,382 --> 00:51:11,082
Get ready, and start.

1460
00:51:11,212 --> 00:51:12,851
Hambuggy-buggy-ham.

1461
00:51:12,852 --> 00:51:14,451
Hambuggy-buggy-ham.

1462
00:51:14,452 --> 00:51:16,381
Hambuggy-buggy-buggy-ham.

1463
00:51:16,382 --> 00:51:17,691
- Wrong. You got it wrong.
- Hambuggy...

1464
00:51:17,692 --> 00:51:19,392
You said, "Hambuggy-buggy-buggy-ham."

1465
00:51:19,922 --> 00:51:21,192
Hambuggy-buggy...

1466
00:51:21,392 --> 00:51:22,921
- From the start.
- Hambuggy-buggy-ham.

1467
00:51:22,922 --> 00:51:25,532
- Hambuggy-buggy-buggy-ham.
- Wrong.

1468
00:51:25,992 --> 00:51:28,202
This won't work.

1469
00:51:28,862 --> 00:51:30,201
This is more confusing to me.

1470
00:51:30,202 --> 00:51:31,231
You go first.

1471
00:51:31,232 --> 00:51:32,501
(Laughing)

1472
00:51:32,502 --> 00:51:33,502
Buggy-buggy.

1473
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:34,972
(The handful daughter is excited.)

1474
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:37,341
Hambuggy-buggy-ham.

1475
00:51:37,342 --> 00:51:38,711
Hambuggy-buggy-ham.

1476
00:51:38,712 --> 00:51:40,041
Hambuggy-buggy-ham.

1477
00:51:40,042 --> 00:51:42,781
Hambuggy-buggy-ham.

1478
00:51:42,782 --> 00:51:45,181
Hambuggy-buggy-ham.

1479
00:51:45,182 --> 00:51:46,782
(Using her whole body to give hints)

1480
00:51:46,912 --> 00:51:47,952
Pass.

1481
00:51:48,022 --> 00:51:50,252
(The speed has gotten faster.)

1482
00:51:50,652 --> 00:51:52,151
Hambuggy-buggy-ham.

1483
00:51:52,152 --> 00:51:53,821
Hambuggy-buggy-ham.

1484
00:51:53,822 --> 00:51:55,822
Hambuggy-buggy-buggy-ham.

1485
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:56,921
Wrong.

1486
00:51:56,922 --> 00:51:58,262
(A buggy trap)

1487
00:51:58,492 --> 00:52:00,862
- Wrong.
- You're just like Dad.

1488
00:52:00,962 --> 00:52:02,632
Hambuggy-buggy-ham.

1489
00:52:02,662 --> 00:52:04,601
(You're already wrong, sir.)

1490
00:52:04,602 --> 00:52:05,832
Wrong.

1491
00:52:06,002 --> 00:52:07,272
- Ham...
- Ham...

1492
00:52:07,442 --> 00:52:08,472
Ham...

1493
00:52:08,602 --> 00:52:10,001
(The daughters are loving it.)

1494
00:52:10,002 --> 00:52:11,671
Hambuggy-buggy-ham.

1495
00:52:11,672 --> 00:52:13,111
(Mom starts right away.)

1496
00:52:13,112 --> 00:52:14,541
Hambuggy-buggy-ham.

1497
00:52:14,542 --> 00:52:15,711
Hambuggy-buggy-ham.

1498
00:52:15,712 --> 00:52:17,041
Hambuggy-buggy-ham.

1499
00:52:17,042 --> 00:52:18,551
Hambuggy-buggy-ham.

1500
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:19,912
Hambuggy-buggy-ham.

1501
00:52:20,112 --> 00:52:21,151
Pass.

1502
00:52:21,152 --> 00:52:22,852
(They still have a chance.)

1503
00:52:23,022 --> 00:52:24,521
Hambuggy-buggy-ham.

1504
00:52:24,522 --> 00:52:26,121
Hambuggy-buggy-ham.

1505
00:52:26,122 --> 00:52:27,591
Hambuggy-buggy-ham.

1506
00:52:27,592 --> 00:52:29,661
Hambuggy-buggy-ham.

1507
00:52:29,662 --> 00:52:31,461
Hambuggy-buggy-ham.

1508
00:52:31,462 --> 00:52:33,232
- Hambuggy-buggy-ham.
- Pass.

1509
00:52:33,292 --> 00:52:35,862
- Dad.
- You did well.

1510
00:52:36,102 --> 00:52:37,832
Hambuggy-buggy-ham.

1511
00:52:38,202 --> 00:52:39,972
Hambuggy-buggy-ham.

1512
00:52:40,132 --> 00:52:42,172
- Hambuggy-buggy-buggy-ham.
- Wrong.

1513
00:52:42,342 --> 00:52:45,312
(They failed the challenge.)

1514
00:52:45,772 --> 00:52:47,111
It is over.

1515
00:52:47,112 --> 00:52:49,011
Good job. We will get going.

1516
00:52:49,012 --> 00:52:51,081
- Gosh. Good job.
- Yes.

1517
00:52:51,082 --> 00:52:52,752
- Good job.
- Good job.

1518
00:52:53,052 --> 00:52:54,622
That was so hard.

1519
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:56,152
- Here.
- It's really ten dollars.

1520
00:52:57,022 --> 00:52:58,392
This is our family.

1521
00:52:58,952 --> 00:53:01,191
The Sung family is about that single strike.

1522
00:53:01,192 --> 00:53:02,722
- It's the single strike.
- It's the single strike.

1523
00:53:02,762 --> 00:53:04,062
That's why you were living in a semi-basement.

1524
00:53:04,192 --> 00:53:05,261
That's why we were living there.

1525
00:53:05,262 --> 00:53:06,291
That's why?

1526
00:53:06,292 --> 00:53:07,531
Yes.

1527
00:53:07,532 --> 00:53:08,961
We won the lottery,

1528
00:53:08,962 --> 00:53:10,202
so we have to be different.

1529
00:53:10,462 --> 00:53:11,902
If we succeed, we get 100 dollars?

1530
00:53:12,032 --> 00:53:13,071
Yes.

1531
00:53:13,072 --> 00:53:14,672
(He has the winning habits of a kid from a wealthy family.)

1532
00:53:15,042 --> 00:53:16,072
So each person gets...

1533
00:53:16,572 --> 00:53:18,412
- It's 20 dollars.
- Gosh.

1534
00:53:18,712 --> 00:53:19,872
Can we get pork cutlet?

1535
00:53:20,912 --> 00:53:22,382
- Pork cutlet sounds good.
- That's good.

1536
00:53:23,482 --> 00:53:26,211
I will tell you the game that will decide...

1537
00:53:26,212 --> 00:53:27,982
on the quality of your lunch today.

1538
00:53:28,352 --> 00:53:31,321
I'm sure you saw this often, and you played it, as well.

1539
00:53:31,322 --> 00:53:33,292
It's the signature game here.

1540
00:53:33,692 --> 00:53:34,722
Guess Who Quiz.

1541
00:53:35,622 --> 00:53:36,722
I'm not good at that.

1542
00:53:37,492 --> 00:53:39,031
You will need to know the people these days...

1543
00:53:39,032 --> 00:53:40,661
to prove that you are from the modern days.

1544
00:53:40,662 --> 00:53:42,101
- People these days?
- I can't remember...

1545
00:53:42,102 --> 00:53:43,831
- names that well.
- Yes.

1546
00:53:43,832 --> 00:53:45,901
I'm so nervous.

1547
00:53:45,902 --> 00:53:47,471
Why don't we have a chant,

1548
00:53:47,472 --> 00:53:49,372
or something?

1549
00:53:49,572 --> 00:53:52,412
There's no way you'll get these right.

1550
00:53:52,812 --> 00:53:55,581
I'll be showing you a photo of someone,

1551
00:53:55,582 --> 00:53:57,781
and you have three seconds to guess who it is.

1552
00:53:57,782 --> 00:53:59,811
If we start here, you only succeed when you make it...

1553
00:53:59,812 --> 00:54:01,621
all the way down and back up.

1554
00:54:01,622 --> 00:54:02,821
There's no practice round?

1555
00:54:02,822 --> 00:54:03,851
There's no practice round.

1556
00:54:03,852 --> 00:54:05,191
You only get five chances.

1557
00:54:05,192 --> 00:54:06,921
- Five chances. Yes.
- And we only have to succeed once?

1558
00:54:06,922 --> 00:54:09,262
- We go down and back up?
- You go down and back up.

1559
00:54:09,892 --> 00:54:11,732
- We get five chances.
- Each person guesses twice.

1560
00:54:11,792 --> 00:54:13,831
- That's not bad. We got this.
- Right.

1561
00:54:13,832 --> 00:54:15,262
Also, this is great for you.

1562
00:54:16,002 --> 00:54:17,361
Is this your first time playing the Guess Who Quiz?

1563
00:54:17,362 --> 00:54:18,431
Who's played it before?

1564
00:54:18,432 --> 00:54:20,502
- I have.
- I've also played it once.

1565
00:54:20,702 --> 00:54:21,902
I've played it before.

1566
00:54:23,372 --> 00:54:24,471
Well, this is my first time.

1567
00:54:24,472 --> 00:54:25,672
(Well, this is my first time.)

1568
00:54:26,212 --> 00:54:27,811
This is my first time too.

1569
00:54:27,812 --> 00:54:29,311
- Let's just insist, then.
- He might not be strict about time.

1570
00:54:29,312 --> 00:54:30,612
- We'll just insist we're right.
- Yes.

1571
00:54:30,712 --> 00:54:31,712
Don't insist.

1572
00:54:31,713 --> 00:54:33,151
I don't know what to do when you insist.

1573
00:54:33,152 --> 00:54:34,652
- Then we should do it.
- Okay.

1574
00:54:35,722 --> 00:54:37,051
The order.

1575
00:54:37,052 --> 00:54:38,291
Do you want to go this way?

1576
00:54:38,292 --> 00:54:39,451
- Sure.
- All right.

1577
00:54:39,452 --> 00:54:41,192
It would be better if the younger ones start us off.

1578
00:54:41,292 --> 00:54:43,891
- We'll decide after playing once, - Right.

1579
00:54:43,892 --> 00:54:45,092
since we have five chances.

1580
00:54:45,432 --> 00:54:46,592
The quiz flusters you.

1581
00:54:46,632 --> 00:54:48,631
When the three seconds are up,

1582
00:54:48,632 --> 00:54:51,272
- you freeze, even if you know.
- The name won't come out.

1583
00:54:51,532 --> 00:54:53,371
Why am I nervous about this?

1584
00:54:53,372 --> 00:54:54,902
Same. For no reason too.

1585
00:54:55,142 --> 00:54:56,701
I do this and flip.

1586
00:54:56,702 --> 00:54:58,071
(The director is more nervous than they are.)

1587
00:54:58,072 --> 00:54:59,411
- Director Shin.
- Director Shin.

1588
00:54:59,412 --> 00:55:01,582
You're making us even more nervous.

1589
00:55:01,782 --> 00:55:03,782
This isn't "Qualifications of Men."

1590
00:55:04,012 --> 00:55:05,811
It’s been ages since he last directed a variety show,

1591
00:55:05,812 --> 00:55:06,851
so he's very nervous.

1592
00:55:06,852 --> 00:55:09,182
Hey, it's been ten years since I last directed a variety show.

1593
00:55:09,852 --> 00:55:11,751
All right. Let's begin.

1594
00:55:11,752 --> 00:55:13,792
Start.

1595
00:55:14,022 --> 00:55:15,321
- In 1, 2, 3.
- Jang Won Young.

1596
00:55:15,322 --> 00:55:16,362
Correct.

1597
00:55:16,762 --> 00:55:18,331
In 1, 2, 3.

1598
00:55:18,332 --> 00:55:20,362
- Kim Yeon Koung.
- Correct.

1599
00:55:21,032 --> 00:55:22,032
In 1, 2, 3.

1600
00:55:22,033 --> 00:55:23,532
- Lee Dong Wook.
- Correct.

1601
00:55:23,632 --> 00:55:25,632
(Those earlier in the order now feel more relaxed.)

1602
00:55:25,702 --> 00:55:26,831
(Maximum tension)

1603
00:55:26,832 --> 00:55:28,071
Start.

1604
00:55:28,072 --> 00:55:29,172
- In one...
- Kim Moo Yul.

1605
00:55:29,702 --> 00:55:31,941
- Correct.
- What a relief.

1606
00:55:31,942 --> 00:55:33,142
(Shaking)

1607
00:55:33,242 --> 00:55:34,342
I don't think I'll know.

1608
00:55:34,482 --> 00:55:35,541
Who could it be?

1609
00:55:35,542 --> 00:55:36,942
In 1, 2, 3.

1610
00:55:37,712 --> 00:55:38,852
Wrong.

1611
00:55:39,082 --> 00:55:40,312
(Who is that?)

1612
00:55:40,452 --> 00:55:41,681
In 1, 2, 3.

1613
00:55:41,682 --> 00:55:42,722
Jonathan.

1614
00:55:43,652 --> 00:55:45,792
(Gosh!)

1615
00:55:45,892 --> 00:55:47,091
(Frozen)

1616
00:55:47,092 --> 00:55:48,092
That's Jonathan.

1617
00:55:48,092 --> 00:55:49,092
- Right.
- Right, I know who he is.

1618
00:55:49,093 --> 00:55:50,591
I just couldn't remember his name.

1619
00:55:50,592 --> 00:55:51,792
That happens.

1620
00:55:51,862 --> 00:55:54,362
I suddenly couldn't remember Moo Yul's name, either.

1621
00:55:54,762 --> 00:55:55,802
So I...

1622
00:55:55,862 --> 00:55:57,402
Everyone else guessed correctly.

1623
00:55:58,402 --> 00:56:00,301
Let's move on to Round 2 with 100 dollars on the line.

1624
00:56:00,302 --> 00:56:01,371
The thing is,

1625
00:56:01,372 --> 00:56:03,372
- the pace needs to be faster.
- Right.

1626
00:56:03,602 --> 00:56:05,672
Which part? The count to three?

1627
00:56:05,742 --> 00:56:07,542
- No, the pace of the photos.
- The photos.

1628
00:56:07,782 --> 00:56:09,841
Really? All right, if you say so.

1629
00:56:09,842 --> 00:56:11,881
(The original pace: 1, 2, 3!)

1630
00:56:11,882 --> 00:56:15,452
(Normally, the quiz should move this fast and nonstop.)

1631
00:56:15,482 --> 00:56:18,022
Let's begin. Start.

1632
00:56:18,322 --> 00:56:19,651
- In 1, 2, 3.
- Jang Won Young.

1633
00:56:19,652 --> 00:56:21,292
(Won Ho weakly shouts, "Correct.")

1634
00:56:21,392 --> 00:56:22,662
- Correct!
- That made me nervous.

1635
00:56:22,722 --> 00:56:23,992
- In 1, 2, 3.
- All right.

1636
00:56:24,222 --> 00:56:25,432
Correct!

1637
00:56:25,532 --> 00:56:27,062
- In 1, 2, 3.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1638
00:56:27,232 --> 00:56:28,301
- Pass.
- Kim Yeon Koung.

1639
00:56:28,302 --> 00:56:29,362
- In 1, 2, 3.
- Correct.

1640
00:56:29,662 --> 00:56:30,902
- Correct!
- Am I going too slow?

1641
00:56:31,172 --> 00:56:33,072
(Yeong Seok: 4 questions, Won Ho: 1 question)

1642
00:56:33,172 --> 00:56:34,471
Start.

1643
00:56:34,472 --> 00:56:36,041
- In 1, 2, 3.
- Lee Dong Wook.

1644
00:56:36,042 --> 00:56:38,212
(He was going unbelievably slow.)

1645
00:56:38,272 --> 00:56:39,911
Gosh, that's how fast Director Na...

1646
00:56:39,912 --> 00:56:41,482
does it every time.

1647
00:56:41,582 --> 00:56:42,711
He doesn't know much.

1648
00:56:42,712 --> 00:56:43,811
(They're openly comparing Won Ho to Yeong Seok.)

1649
00:56:43,812 --> 00:56:45,881
- I'll go a bit faster.
- Let's go.

1650
00:56:45,882 --> 00:56:47,952
Let's begin Round Two.

1651
00:56:48,152 --> 00:56:49,381
Start.

1652
00:56:49,382 --> 00:56:50,651
- In 1, 2, 3.
- Kim Dong Hyun!

1653
00:56:50,652 --> 00:56:51,722
Correct!

1654
00:56:52,292 --> 00:56:53,292
Moving on.

1655
00:56:53,592 --> 00:56:54,721
In 1, 2, 3.

1656
00:56:54,722 --> 00:56:56,262
- Go A Ra.
- Correct.

1657
00:56:56,322 --> 00:56:58,162
(He correctly guessed another actor from the "Reply" series.)

1658
00:56:58,192 --> 00:56:59,231
Start. In one...

1659
00:56:59,232 --> 00:57:00,262
Gosh.

1660
00:57:01,032 --> 00:57:02,901
(Without even showing the photo,)

1661
00:57:02,902 --> 00:57:04,501
(he began counting.)

1662
00:57:04,502 --> 00:57:07,331
My bad. Start. In 1, 2, 3.

1663
00:57:07,332 --> 00:57:09,402
- Cho Hye Lyun.
- Gosh.

1664
00:57:09,472 --> 00:57:10,901
Moving on. Starting...

1665
00:57:10,902 --> 00:57:12,011
(Whispering)

1666
00:57:12,012 --> 00:57:13,611
Now. In 1, 2, 3.

1667
00:57:13,612 --> 00:57:14,841
- What?
- Gosh, Sung Kyun!

1668
00:57:14,842 --> 00:57:15,942
- Wrong!
- Wait.

1669
00:57:16,012 --> 00:57:17,852
- That's Joo Woo Jae.
- It's Joo Woo Jae.

1670
00:57:18,652 --> 00:57:20,081
Did you tell him?

1671
00:57:20,082 --> 00:57:21,252
- Excuse me?
- Did you tell him?

1672
00:57:21,322 --> 00:57:22,721
- No, he didn't.
- I didn't tell him.

1673
00:57:22,722 --> 00:57:23,782
But...

1674
00:57:24,822 --> 00:57:26,052
you should enunciate next time.

1675
00:57:26,422 --> 00:57:28,322
(Here's what happened.)

1676
00:57:28,522 --> 00:57:31,662
(Right before Won Ho flipped the photo, it was faintly visible.)

1677
00:57:31,762 --> 00:57:33,261
Moving on. Starting...

1678
00:57:33,262 --> 00:57:34,262
- Joo Woo Jae.
- Now.

1679
00:57:34,662 --> 00:57:38,172
(But Sung Kyun didn't catch it.)

1680
00:57:38,372 --> 00:57:40,532
(Jun Yeol made a quick move.)

1681
00:57:40,732 --> 00:57:42,472
That's it for Round Two.

1682
00:57:42,672 --> 00:57:44,201
Are you going to maintain this order?

1683
00:57:44,202 --> 00:57:45,341
Maybe...

1684
00:57:45,342 --> 00:57:46,542
you should move to the front.

1685
00:57:46,612 --> 00:57:48,211
- This is the most difficult spot.
- Your spot is very difficult.

1686
00:57:48,212 --> 00:57:50,382
- It's the most difficult one.
- You have to go again right away.

1687
00:57:50,742 --> 00:57:52,012
- Can we change seats?
- Of course.

1688
00:57:52,352 --> 00:57:54,281
- I'll move over here.
- But I still have to...

1689
00:57:54,282 --> 00:57:56,221
I still have to get it right again at the end.

1690
00:57:56,222 --> 00:57:58,291
But after you go first, you'll feel more relaxed.

1691
00:57:58,292 --> 00:58:00,522
- No, my heart will beat faster.
- Really?

1692
00:58:00,622 --> 00:58:03,061
- Right, if he fails at the end...
- That's right. At the end.

1693
00:58:03,062 --> 00:58:04,932
But if he fails at the beginning, the round will be over anyway.

1694
00:58:05,032 --> 00:58:06,661
- Round 3.
- Round 3.

1695
00:58:06,662 --> 00:58:08,202
Let's begin.

1696
00:58:08,302 --> 00:58:10,462
- I don't think he'll get it.
- Start.

1697
00:58:10,602 --> 00:58:11,631
In 1, 2, 3.

1698
00:58:11,632 --> 00:58:12,831
(Gibberish)

1699
00:58:12,832 --> 00:58:14,071
- Gosh, Sung Kyun.
- No. Wait!

1700
00:58:14,072 --> 00:58:15,202
Wrong!

1701
00:58:16,042 --> 00:58:18,442
(What?)

1702
00:58:20,842 --> 00:58:22,211
- Gosh, Sung Kyun.
- No. Wait!

1703
00:58:22,212 --> 00:58:23,712
(Laughing)

1704
00:58:23,842 --> 00:58:26,482
I told you he wouldn't get it.

1705
00:58:27,152 --> 00:58:28,822
- You really don't know?
- Wait.

1706
00:58:29,082 --> 00:58:30,151
- It's Woo Shik. Choi Woo Shik.
- That photo of him...

1707
00:58:30,152 --> 00:58:31,622
Choi Woo Shik. That's right.

1708
00:58:31,852 --> 00:58:34,191
- That photo feels a bit odd.
- He looks oddly unfamiliar, right?

1709
00:58:34,192 --> 00:58:36,021
You should have...

1710
00:58:36,022 --> 00:58:38,992
brought a photo that's clearly Choi Woo Shik.

1711
00:58:39,162 --> 00:58:41,462
This is unmistakably Choi Woo Shik.

1712
00:58:41,632 --> 00:58:44,262
Let's just redo this round.

1713
00:58:44,402 --> 00:58:46,571
Aside from Sung Kyun, the rest of you knew the answer.

1714
00:58:46,572 --> 00:58:48,201
No, but ultimately...

1715
00:58:48,202 --> 00:58:49,541
That photo is low quality, though.

1716
00:58:49,542 --> 00:58:50,971
It should have shown Choi Woo Shik clearly.

1717
00:58:50,972 --> 00:58:52,672
The photo should have been unmistakably Choi Woo Shik.

1718
00:58:52,742 --> 00:58:54,141
(Judging from the photo, the person resembles Choi Woo Shik the most.)

1719
00:58:54,142 --> 00:58:55,642
(That’s enough.)

1720
00:58:55,812 --> 00:58:57,411
I guess five chances aren't that many.

1721
00:58:57,412 --> 00:58:59,352
- We have two left.
- You have two chances left.

1722
00:58:59,482 --> 00:59:00,881
We have to succeed this time...

1723
00:59:00,882 --> 00:59:02,622
- to be safe.
- Right.

1724
00:59:02,852 --> 00:59:04,621
Are you going to stay in this order?

1725
00:59:04,622 --> 00:59:06,552
Wait.

1726
00:59:06,622 --> 00:59:08,221
- He should...
- I'll go first.

1727
00:59:08,222 --> 00:59:10,191
Going first could be too much for Sung Kyun.

1728
00:59:10,192 --> 00:59:12,462
(Sung Kyun and Jae Hong switch seats.)

1729
00:59:12,892 --> 00:59:14,801
All right. Let's go.

1730
00:59:14,802 --> 00:59:17,602
Let's begin Round Four. Start.

1731
00:59:17,802 --> 00:59:19,131
In 1, 2, 3.

1732
00:59:19,132 --> 00:59:20,331
- Kim Sook.
- Correct.

1733
00:59:20,332 --> 00:59:21,501
- Look how relaxed he is.
- Gosh.

1734
00:59:21,502 --> 00:59:22,602
(An unexpected ace with 0 wrong answers)

1735
00:59:23,402 --> 00:59:24,612
- Jun Ji Hyun.
- Gosh.

1736
00:59:24,912 --> 00:59:26,942
Everyone knows Jun Ji Hyun.

1737
00:59:27,142 --> 00:59:29,342
Moving on. Start.

1738
00:59:29,582 --> 00:59:30,741
- Lee Young Ji.
- In 1, 2...

1739
00:59:30,742 --> 00:59:31,751
Gosh. Correct.

1740
00:59:31,752 --> 00:59:33,452
(She's correct, but...)

1741
00:59:33,682 --> 00:59:34,821
- What was that?
- Nothing.

1742
00:59:34,822 --> 00:59:35,822
He's just...

1743
00:59:35,823 --> 00:59:36,982
What are you looking at?

1744
00:59:37,222 --> 00:59:39,321
(Normally,)

1745
00:59:39,322 --> 00:59:41,562
(the photos should be pulled out from right behind the partition.)

1746
00:59:41,722 --> 00:59:43,692
(But our rookie host...)

1747
00:59:43,822 --> 00:59:45,992
(keeps holding the photos above the partition.)

1748
00:59:46,932 --> 00:59:49,202
(And Jun Yeol just took advantage of this.)

1749
00:59:49,462 --> 00:59:50,601
This should be fine.

1750
00:59:50,602 --> 00:59:52,401
(Better late than never, the partition is put to use.)

1751
00:59:52,402 --> 00:59:53,872
- Whose turn is it? It's you.
- All right. Moving on.

1752
00:59:54,572 --> 00:59:56,401
- In 1, 2, 3.
- Kim Tae Ri!

1753
00:59:56,402 --> 00:59:58,371
Correct.

1754
00:59:58,372 --> 01:00:00,371
I'm the wild card now.

1755
01:00:00,372 --> 01:00:01,382
Here.

1756
01:00:02,042 --> 01:00:03,181
In 1, 2, 3.

1757
01:00:03,182 --> 01:00:04,312
- Jin.
- Yes, correct!

1758
01:00:05,182 --> 01:00:06,781
(She correctly guessed the global superstar.)

1759
01:00:06,782 --> 01:00:08,021
You could have gotten in trouble if you didn't know him.

1760
01:00:08,022 --> 01:00:09,822
(She correctly guessed the global superstar.)

1761
01:00:09,882 --> 01:00:11,022
We made it halfway.

1762
01:00:11,592 --> 01:00:12,692
Moving on.

1763
01:00:13,652 --> 01:00:15,292
In 1, 2, 3.

1764
01:00:15,392 --> 01:00:17,022
- Hey! You don't know him?
- Wrong!

1765
01:00:17,422 --> 01:00:19,062
Hey! You don't know him?

1766
01:00:19,262 --> 01:00:21,562
You don't know TARZZAN?

1767
01:00:21,702 --> 01:00:24,062
How can you not know TARZZAN of ALLDAY PROJECT?

1768
01:00:24,402 --> 01:00:26,302
(Bowing his head deeply)

1769
01:00:26,472 --> 01:00:27,571
(The entire team is in low spirits.)

1770
01:00:27,572 --> 01:00:29,071
(Jumping up)

1771
01:00:29,072 --> 01:00:31,812
My outfit is similar to TARZZAN's.

1772
01:00:33,042 --> 01:00:34,111
Right.

1773
01:00:34,112 --> 01:00:35,342
Cheetah's friend, TARZZAN.

1774
01:00:36,182 --> 01:00:37,281
How do you not know TARZZAN?

1775
01:00:37,282 --> 01:00:38,982
- I'm not very familiar with idols.
- That's right.

1776
01:00:39,582 --> 01:00:41,622
(They failed Round 4 as well.)

1777
01:00:41,882 --> 01:00:43,351
Gosh, I didn't think it would be me.

1778
01:00:43,352 --> 01:00:44,621
(Gosh, I didn't think it would be me.)

1779
01:00:44,622 --> 01:00:45,952
Wait, so we...

1780
01:00:46,092 --> 01:00:47,121
- We have 1 left.
- We have 1 left?

1781
01:00:47,122 --> 01:00:48,161
Yes, we have one left.

1782
01:00:48,162 --> 01:00:49,262
This is the last chance.

1783
01:00:49,462 --> 01:00:51,632
This is the last round.

1784
01:00:51,792 --> 01:00:53,131
Shall we begin the final round?

1785
01:00:53,132 --> 01:00:54,461
- Sure.
- Yes.

1786
01:00:54,462 --> 01:00:55,632
Let's just quickly wrap up and leave.

1787
01:00:55,732 --> 01:00:57,462
I don't care if we only get ten dollars.

1788
01:00:57,602 --> 01:01:00,072
- We'll just starve.
- Don't give up.

1789
01:01:00,172 --> 01:01:01,341
Come on.

1790
01:01:01,342 --> 01:01:03,402
The final round. Start.

1791
01:01:03,642 --> 01:01:04,741
In 1, 2, 3.

1792
01:01:04,742 --> 01:01:06,072
- Son Ye Jin.
- Correct.

1793
01:01:07,172 --> 01:01:08,311
- In 1, 2...
- Park Myung Soo.

1794
01:01:08,312 --> 01:01:09,412
Correct.

1795
01:01:10,942 --> 01:01:12,181
- In 1, 2...
- Lee Kwang Soo?

1796
01:01:12,182 --> 01:01:13,281
Correct.

1797
01:01:13,282 --> 01:01:14,822
I was confused about his last name.

1798
01:01:14,982 --> 01:01:16,722
I have a feeling this will be the last one.

1799
01:01:17,382 --> 01:01:18,992
- In 1, 2, 3.
- Hello Miffy.

1800
01:01:19,822 --> 01:01:21,151
- Is it not?
- Did you say "Hello Miffy?"

1801
01:01:21,152 --> 01:01:22,521
- That's correct.
- Isn't that Miffy?

1802
01:01:22,522 --> 01:01:24,021
- That's correct.
- It's Miffy.

1803
01:01:24,022 --> 01:01:25,591
It is Miffy.

1804
01:01:25,592 --> 01:01:28,001
- Wait, it's Hello Kitty.
- What did you say?

1805
01:01:28,002 --> 01:01:29,731
- No, you got Miffy right.
- It's Miffy.

1806
01:01:29,732 --> 01:01:31,772
You just said Miffy.

1807
01:01:32,272 --> 01:01:33,371
Hello, Miffy.

1808
01:01:33,372 --> 01:01:34,671
- He was saying hello.
- Hello.

1809
01:01:34,672 --> 01:01:35,771
- Hello, Miffy.
- I was...

1810
01:01:35,772 --> 01:01:37,641
- so happy to see Miffy.
- He was glad to see Miffy.

1811
01:01:37,642 --> 01:01:38,911
I was happy, so I said, "Hello, Miffy."

1812
01:01:38,912 --> 01:01:40,011
Did you even say "Miffy?"

1813
01:01:40,012 --> 01:01:41,242
- I said, "Miffy." - He said, "Miffy."

1814
01:01:41,272 --> 01:01:43,641
Miffy is from abroad. Miffy is from overseas.

1815
01:01:43,642 --> 01:01:46,952
(Okay, Jun Yeol.)

1816
01:01:46,982 --> 01:01:49,152
Moving on. Start.

1817
01:01:49,352 --> 01:01:50,451
- In 1, 2...
- Kim Yuna.

1818
01:01:50,452 --> 01:01:51,592
Gosh, correct.

1819
01:01:52,352 --> 01:01:53,352
Here.

1820
01:01:53,353 --> 01:01:55,091
- In 1, 2, 3.
- Kim Da Mi.

1821
01:01:55,092 --> 01:01:56,191
- Gosh.
- Correct.

1822
01:01:56,192 --> 01:01:57,792
We're with the same management agency.

1823
01:01:57,862 --> 01:01:58,891
- The same management agency.
- Gosh, we did it.

1824
01:01:58,892 --> 01:01:59,892
- Okay.
- The same management agency.

1825
01:02:01,232 --> 01:02:02,531
- In 1, 2, 3.
- Lee Juck.

1826
01:02:02,532 --> 01:02:03,732
Gosh, correct.

1827
01:02:04,772 --> 01:02:08,201
(And now, the final 2)

1828
01:02:08,202 --> 01:02:09,402
Hey, Sung Kyun.

1829
01:02:10,102 --> 01:02:11,302
Honey!

1830
01:02:12,072 --> 01:02:13,372
- In 1, 2...
- Joon Park!

1831
01:02:14,342 --> 01:02:15,411
(Yes!)

1832
01:02:15,412 --> 01:02:16,441
(Shaking)

1833
01:02:16,442 --> 01:02:17,811
Let's go eat.

1834
01:02:17,812 --> 01:02:18,851
(Switching gears immediately)

1835
01:02:18,852 --> 01:02:19,982
This is the last one.

1836
01:02:20,752 --> 01:02:22,021
- In 1, 2, 3.
- Chimchakman.

1837
01:02:22,022 --> 01:02:23,882
- Yes!
- Correct!

1838
01:02:24,152 --> 01:02:25,292
Success.

1839
01:02:25,352 --> 01:02:26,451
(In awe)

1840
01:02:26,452 --> 01:02:28,592
(Cheering)

1841
01:02:28,792 --> 01:02:31,392
(Victory for Jung Bong's family)

1842
01:02:31,662 --> 01:02:32,891
We get to go enjoy the food.

1843
01:02:32,892 --> 01:02:34,192
I knew you'd get it!

1844
01:02:34,262 --> 01:02:36,862
Take it. You were so calm.

1845
01:02:37,632 --> 01:02:39,672
You can change outfits if you want.

1846
01:02:39,702 --> 01:02:42,072
I'm fine with wearing this all day.

1847
01:02:42,172 --> 01:02:43,501
No, we have to show them.

1848
01:02:43,502 --> 01:02:44,771
- Right.
- Let's go to Goseong like this.

1849
01:02:44,772 --> 01:02:46,711
We have to show that we're unbeatable.

1850
01:02:46,712 --> 01:02:48,282
We'll stay like this all the way to Goseong.

1851
01:02:48,342 --> 01:02:49,811
(Jung Bong's family successfully escaped 1988,)

1852
01:02:49,812 --> 01:02:51,282
(but they chose not to change clothes.)

1853
01:02:51,752 --> 01:02:53,011
Thank you for your efforts.

1854
01:02:53,012 --> 01:02:54,651
- Thank you for your efforts.
- Thank you for your efforts.

1855
01:02:54,652 --> 01:02:56,381
Jun Yeol.

1856
01:02:56,382 --> 01:02:59,251
I hear you have to leave because of your schedule.

1857
01:02:59,252 --> 01:03:01,292
- Anyway...
- "Anyway."

1858
01:03:01,422 --> 01:03:02,891
(Feeling awkward)

1859
01:03:02,892 --> 01:03:04,321
I'm really sad that I have to leave,

1860
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:06,692
but we're near the end of filming, so I have to be there.

1861
01:03:07,062 --> 01:03:08,232
I feel bad about having to go.

1862
01:03:08,262 --> 01:03:09,802
Why don't you call me?

1863
01:03:10,002 --> 01:03:12,132
Other people's sons call me way more often than you do.

1864
01:03:12,232 --> 01:03:14,272
(Mother...)

1865
01:03:14,332 --> 01:03:15,501
Do you want me to tell a heartwarming story about you?

1866
01:03:15,502 --> 01:03:16,541
Yes, please.

1867
01:03:16,542 --> 01:03:17,741
This is what Jun Yeol did.

1868
01:03:17,742 --> 01:03:19,441
My son.

1869
01:03:19,442 --> 01:03:21,481
When I said I wanted something from Nike,

1870
01:03:21,482 --> 01:03:22,512
(I thought this would be heartwarming.)

1871
01:03:23,082 --> 01:03:24,952
Jun Yeol bought it with his own money and sent it to me.

1872
01:03:25,012 --> 01:03:26,411
How is this a heartwarming story?

1873
01:03:26,412 --> 01:03:27,812
It was just a gift I gave you as your son.

1874
01:03:28,122 --> 01:03:30,182
(Son. What about me, your dad?)

1875
01:03:30,352 --> 01:03:32,021
Was that a good, heartwarming story?

1876
01:03:32,022 --> 01:03:34,292
(She embarrassed him and then asked if it’s all right.)

1877
01:03:34,422 --> 01:03:35,762
Anyway,

1878
01:03:35,862 --> 01:03:37,391
I hope you all have fun,

1879
01:03:37,392 --> 01:03:38,531
enjoy the food,

1880
01:03:38,532 --> 01:03:40,231
- and make good memories.
- Okay.

1881
01:03:40,232 --> 01:03:41,561
Thank you for inviting me.

1882
01:03:41,562 --> 01:03:43,502
- We'll enjoy the food.
- Thank you for your efforts.

1883
01:03:44,632 --> 01:03:45,801
(Hugging)

1884
01:03:45,802 --> 01:03:47,371
We can order a dish for Jun Yeol...

1885
01:03:47,372 --> 01:03:49,202
and share it among ourselves.

1886
01:03:50,402 --> 01:03:53,141
The money will be shared by four now, so that should be better.

1887
01:03:53,142 --> 01:03:54,271
- Right.
- Thank you for your efforts.

1888
01:03:54,272 --> 01:03:56,441
- Let's get moving.
- Thank you for your efforts.

1889
01:03:56,442 --> 01:03:57,512
Thank you for your efforts.

1890
01:03:57,842 --> 01:03:59,711
- Gosh.
- Do you have a heartwarming story?

1891
01:03:59,712 --> 01:04:00,851
Well, Jun Yeol...

1892
01:04:00,852 --> 01:04:02,482
(Let's head over to the last family now.)

1893
01:04:03,052 --> 01:04:04,891
I'm sorry to tell you this, but the members here...

1894
01:04:04,892 --> 01:04:06,792
will have a lot of difficulties.

1895
01:04:06,952 --> 01:04:09,521
There's a huge chance that we'll be stuck here until tomorrow.

1896
01:04:09,522 --> 01:04:11,531
I don't think Bo Gum knows much about this.

1897
01:04:11,532 --> 01:04:12,861
No, he doesn't.

1898
01:04:12,862 --> 01:04:13,961
That's right.

1899
01:04:13,962 --> 01:04:15,702
(They can't help but be worried about Bo Gum.)

1900
01:04:16,102 --> 01:04:19,571
And I think these two will be stuck here for a long time.

1901
01:04:19,572 --> 01:04:23,242
We'll still try our best and attempt to do well.

1902
01:04:23,502 --> 01:04:24,771
Let's do this.

1903
01:04:24,772 --> 01:04:27,411
The game is simple.

1904
01:04:27,412 --> 01:04:28,481
It's called...

1905
01:04:28,482 --> 01:04:29,482
(What kind of game could it be?)

1906
01:04:29,582 --> 01:04:31,481
the Category Initial Quiz.

1907
01:04:31,482 --> 01:04:32,651
- An initial quiz.
- The Category...

1908
01:04:32,652 --> 01:04:34,581
- Initial Quiz.
- Initial Quiz.

1909
01:04:34,582 --> 01:04:35,582
(What's that?)

1910
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:37,852
We'll tell you the category in advance.

1911
01:04:38,052 --> 01:04:39,951
- Then we'll show you initials.
- Okay.

1912
01:04:39,952 --> 01:04:43,422
Each of you has to come up with a word for the given initials.

1913
01:04:43,522 --> 01:04:45,792
- For example, the theme is winter.
- Sure.

1914
01:04:45,862 --> 01:04:47,062
I'll go first.

1915
01:04:47,392 --> 01:04:49,301
- Christmas.
- Yes, correct.

1916
01:04:49,302 --> 01:04:51,532
- Since it's winter, it's Christmas.
- Gosh, Dong Hwi.

1917
01:04:51,602 --> 01:04:53,231
In 1, 2, 3.

1918
01:04:53,232 --> 01:04:54,402
Wait? No, that's not it.

1919
01:04:54,772 --> 01:04:56,242
That's something you say to me.

1920
01:04:56,902 --> 01:04:58,511
Do we have to go down and back up to succeed?

1921
01:04:58,512 --> 01:05:00,642
- We have to make it back up.
- That's impossible.

1922
01:05:00,942 --> 01:05:02,941
I just think you're...

1923
01:05:02,942 --> 01:05:04,812
overestimating us.

1924
01:05:05,112 --> 01:05:06,351
I knew this would happen.

1925
01:05:06,352 --> 01:05:07,382
(Concerned)

1926
01:05:07,612 --> 01:05:09,681
We're giving you a total of five chances.

1927
01:05:09,682 --> 01:05:10,982
That's a relief.

1928
01:05:11,452 --> 01:05:13,521
As you all may know,

1929
01:05:13,522 --> 01:05:16,592
I'm quite good at the Initial Quiz and the Guess Who Quiz.

1930
01:05:16,892 --> 01:05:17,892
(That's good news.)

1931
01:05:17,893 --> 01:05:20,031
On the Guess Who Quiz prepared by Director Na,

1932
01:05:20,032 --> 01:05:21,931
I correctly guessed 15 people in a row.

1933
01:05:21,932 --> 01:05:23,301
- You knew as soon as you saw them?
- Of course.

1934
01:05:23,302 --> 01:05:25,232
- Right away.
- That's so cool.

1935
01:05:25,632 --> 01:05:26,972
- We have to train.
- I'm in trouble.

1936
01:05:27,702 --> 01:05:29,542
I don't think I can do this.

1937
01:05:29,902 --> 01:05:32,341
So all we have to do is remember the theme accurately.

1938
01:05:32,342 --> 01:05:34,411
Right. You have to tell us what the category is.

1939
01:05:34,412 --> 01:05:36,711
- They will.
- Then the thing is,

1940
01:05:36,712 --> 01:05:37,941
do these usually have an answer each?

1941
01:05:37,942 --> 01:05:39,512
Like a predetermined answer?

1942
01:05:40,412 --> 01:05:42,082
Can we come up with our own answer?

1943
01:05:42,422 --> 01:05:43,751
You can persuade them.

1944
01:05:43,752 --> 01:05:44,992
- You can persuade them.
- You can persuade them.

1945
01:05:45,422 --> 01:05:46,791
It doesn't matter as long as it's grammatically correct.

1946
01:05:46,792 --> 01:05:48,021
- Right.
- Like earlier,

1947
01:05:48,022 --> 01:05:49,891
- if you go with "waiting," - Waiting?

1948
01:05:49,892 --> 01:05:51,661
you could argue that you're waiting for Santa.

1949
01:05:51,662 --> 01:05:53,662
Instead of trying to get it right, you're thinking of loopholes.

1950
01:05:53,892 --> 01:05:55,931
So you have to tell us the category.

1951
01:05:55,932 --> 01:05:57,601
- We'll be telling you the category.
- Just tell us the category.

1952
01:05:57,602 --> 01:05:59,131
- Sake.
- Sake is perfect for winter.

1953
01:05:59,132 --> 01:06:00,831
- I don't think that will work.
- It is possible.

1954
01:06:00,832 --> 01:06:01,941
- It's possible.
- Is it?

1955
01:06:01,942 --> 01:06:03,002
(Things might not go smoothly with this family.)

1956
01:06:03,172 --> 01:06:05,011
The way I see it, seating is important.

1957
01:06:05,012 --> 01:06:06,811
- You're right.
- Seating is important.

1958
01:06:06,812 --> 01:06:08,412
The person sitting here goes only once, right?

1959
01:06:09,012 --> 01:06:10,111
- Then...
- That's right.

1960
01:06:10,112 --> 01:06:11,911
You and Kyung Pyo should switch seats.

1961
01:06:11,912 --> 01:06:12,912
Okay.

1962
01:06:12,913 --> 01:06:14,751
- I have to...
- That's the most difficult seat.

1963
01:06:14,752 --> 01:06:16,081
I've never guessed correctly before.

1964
01:06:16,082 --> 01:06:17,982
- You should be sitting here.
- Right.

1965
01:06:18,352 --> 01:06:20,091
- You should go twice.
- I have to go twice at the end too.

1966
01:06:20,092 --> 01:06:22,091
- I see.
- I go first, and we make it...

1967
01:06:22,092 --> 01:06:23,121
back up. It's the same.

1968
01:06:23,122 --> 01:06:25,191
So the person who's worst at this should sit here, right?

1969
01:06:25,192 --> 01:06:26,261
- Because they'll go once.
- They'll go once, so it's fine.

1970
01:06:26,262 --> 01:06:27,491
Then you should be sitting here.

1971
01:06:27,492 --> 01:06:29,502
I think you’re worse at this than I am. No?

1972
01:06:30,262 --> 01:06:32,702
- I think he's hurt by that.
- He's worse at this than I am.

1973
01:06:33,702 --> 01:06:34,732
Am I right?

1974
01:06:35,342 --> 01:06:36,571
I'm serious.

1975
01:06:36,572 --> 01:06:37,941
Doing something like this is exciting for me.

1976
01:06:37,942 --> 01:06:39,072
(Whatever. Doing something like this is exciting for me.)

1977
01:06:39,212 --> 01:06:40,742
You're excited or nervous?

1978
01:06:41,142 --> 01:06:43,382
If your heart is pounding, it means you're excited.

1979
01:06:43,442 --> 01:06:44,951
- Usually...
- Because you're scared.

1980
01:06:44,952 --> 01:06:46,882
- Scared? I got what you meant.
- It's okay, Dad.

1981
01:06:47,852 --> 01:06:49,152
Is there a time limit?

1982
01:06:49,252 --> 01:06:50,421
- Yes, 3 seconds.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1983
01:06:50,422 --> 01:06:51,822
You have to answer within three seconds.

1984
01:06:52,052 --> 01:06:54,122
Within 5 seconds. In 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

1985
01:06:54,922 --> 01:06:57,091
How about this? Since this is the 10th anniversary,

1986
01:06:57,092 --> 01:06:58,492
- let's do 10 seconds.
- In 10 seconds?

1987
01:06:58,962 --> 01:07:00,592
But we'll do ten seconds at steady speed.

1988
01:07:00,832 --> 01:07:01,832
Steady...

1989
01:07:02,132 --> 01:07:03,361
Is ten seconds too long?

1990
01:07:03,362 --> 01:07:04,632
The tenth anni... Yes.

1991
01:07:04,902 --> 01:07:05,902
(Thinking)

1992
01:07:05,903 --> 01:07:07,732
Since this is "Reply 1988," let's go with 8 seconds.

1993
01:07:08,172 --> 01:07:09,872
I think having a shorter time limit is better.

1994
01:07:10,442 --> 01:07:13,011
Not getting it right because of the time limit is less embarrassing.

1995
01:07:13,012 --> 01:07:15,512
You're right.

1996
01:07:15,742 --> 01:07:17,641
- Since we have five chances, - Let's do a shorter time limit.

1997
01:07:17,642 --> 01:07:20,011
we'll go with 3 seconds on the 1st round.

1998
01:07:20,012 --> 01:07:21,312
And if that doesn't work, let's...

1999
01:07:21,452 --> 01:07:23,182
- All right.
- Good.

2000
01:07:23,452 --> 01:07:25,422
I don't think my turn will even come.

2001
01:07:26,252 --> 01:07:27,292
Let's give it a try.

2002
01:07:28,022 --> 01:07:29,221
You got this.

2003
01:07:29,222 --> 01:07:30,362
Let's do this.

2004
01:07:30,462 --> 01:07:32,061
- Focus, everyone.
- Okay.

2005
01:07:32,062 --> 01:07:33,132
Focus.

2006
01:07:33,662 --> 01:07:34,662
I'll go first.

2007
01:07:34,663 --> 01:07:36,202
- I'll tell you the category first.
- Okay.

2008
01:07:36,302 --> 01:07:37,832
The first category.

2009
01:07:38,262 --> 01:07:40,402
- It's fruits.
- Fruits.

2010
01:07:40,502 --> 01:07:41,801
This could be easy.

2011
01:07:41,802 --> 01:07:43,242
- Let's begin right away.
- Okay.

2012
01:07:43,872 --> 01:07:44,971
Here.

2013
01:07:44,972 --> 01:07:46,512
- In one... Correct.
- Banana.

2014
01:07:46,872 --> 01:07:48,982
- Banana.
- I should have done that one.

2015
01:07:50,112 --> 01:07:52,452
In 1, 2, 3.

2016
01:07:52,552 --> 01:07:53,581
- Peach. Let's go.
- Correct.

2017
01:07:53,582 --> 01:07:54,582
Nice.

2018
01:07:54,782 --> 01:07:56,021
Correct. That's a warning.

2019
01:07:56,022 --> 01:07:57,051
Focus.

2020
01:07:57,052 --> 01:07:58,451
- In 1, 2, 3.
- Watermelon.

2021
01:07:58,452 --> 01:07:59,522
- Okay!
- Correct.

2022
01:07:59,992 --> 01:08:01,592
- Okay!
- Yes, nice.

2023
01:08:02,662 --> 01:08:04,462
In 1, 2, 3.

2024
01:08:04,892 --> 01:08:06,592
- Wrong!
- It's Korean melon!

2025
01:08:07,432 --> 01:08:08,832
- In 1, 2, 3.
- You know this.

2026
01:08:09,202 --> 01:08:10,802
- Wrong!
- It's Korean melon!

2027
01:08:12,002 --> 01:08:13,502
Hey!

2028
01:08:14,132 --> 01:08:15,202
Goodness.

2029
01:08:15,402 --> 01:08:16,541
- Did you know this?
- I did.

2030
01:08:16,542 --> 01:08:18,442
- Gosh, I knew this one.
- It's Korean...

2031
01:08:18,612 --> 01:08:19,912
This isn't easy.

2032
01:08:20,242 --> 01:08:22,611
- I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
- What I'm thinking is that...

2033
01:08:22,612 --> 01:08:25,211
Moo Sung and Jae Myung...

2034
01:08:25,212 --> 01:08:26,812
are so amazing right now.

2035
01:08:27,612 --> 01:08:28,621
I was shocked.

2036
01:08:28,622 --> 01:08:30,021
Please remember that I got at least one right.

2037
01:08:30,022 --> 01:08:31,081
Gosh, amazing.

2038
01:08:31,082 --> 01:08:32,952
I did it within three seconds.

2039
01:08:33,152 --> 01:08:34,321
I'm sorry.

2040
01:08:34,322 --> 01:08:35,622
No, Bo Gum.

2041
01:08:35,762 --> 01:08:37,591
I could get it wrong as soon as we begin a round.

2042
01:08:37,592 --> 01:08:39,161
We still have four chances left.

2043
01:08:39,162 --> 01:08:41,862
Do you usually not like Korean melon?

2044
01:08:42,162 --> 01:08:43,602
- I do.
- No way.

2045
01:08:43,632 --> 01:08:46,102
For some reason, I was suddenly thinking of grapefruit.

2046
01:08:46,632 --> 01:08:47,932
- I felt at ease...
- But it wasn't grapefruit.

2047
01:08:48,172 --> 01:08:49,801
I felt at ease because you got it wrong.

2048
01:08:49,802 --> 01:08:51,541
You know when an actor gets their line wrong,

2049
01:08:51,542 --> 01:08:53,672
- the next person feels at ease.
- That's right.

2050
01:08:53,842 --> 01:08:55,381
That was Bo Gum's intention all along.

2051
01:08:55,382 --> 01:08:56,641
- That's right.
- I see.

2052
01:08:56,642 --> 01:08:57,781
(Just how far ahead was Bo Gum thinking?)

2053
01:08:57,782 --> 01:08:59,211
If the actor before you delivers their lines perfectly...

2054
01:08:59,212 --> 01:09:01,152
Thank you for seeing it that way.

2055
01:09:01,252 --> 01:09:02,781
- I'll do better this time.
- I'm nervous.

2056
01:09:02,782 --> 01:09:03,822
(Focus)

2057
01:09:03,982 --> 01:09:05,621
Are you okay with the current seating?

2058
01:09:05,622 --> 01:09:07,291
I think it will be fine. I have faith.

2059
01:09:07,292 --> 01:09:09,022
- Let’s keep it as it is.
- Okay.

2060
01:09:09,292 --> 01:09:11,161
I'll tell you the category for Round Two.

2061
01:09:11,162 --> 01:09:12,362
What could it be this time?

2062
01:09:13,062 --> 01:09:14,431
- What's the category?
- The category is...

2063
01:09:14,432 --> 01:09:16,231
- countries.
- We're in trouble.

2064
01:09:16,232 --> 01:09:17,402
- We're in trouble.
- Countries?

2065
01:09:17,432 --> 01:09:19,301
- This one's hard.
- Goodness.

2066
01:09:19,302 --> 01:09:21,471
I don't even know the full names, let alone the initials.

2067
01:09:21,472 --> 01:09:23,171
- That's right.
- I really don't know much.

2068
01:09:23,172 --> 01:09:24,942
Countries? Gosh.

2069
01:09:25,112 --> 01:09:26,771
- The USA.
- How are we supposed to guess...

2070
01:09:26,772 --> 01:09:28,011
- countries like Venezuela?
- Right.

2071
01:09:28,012 --> 01:09:29,581
- Macedonia, Venezuela...
- Switzerland,

2072
01:09:29,582 --> 01:09:31,812
Spain, Chile,

2073
01:09:31,912 --> 01:09:33,611
- Paraguay.
- Macedonia, Venezuela,

2074
01:09:33,612 --> 01:09:35,951
- Chile, Paraguay.
- The Dominican Republic.

2075
01:09:35,952 --> 01:09:37,081
- Argentina.
- Ethiopia.

2076
01:09:37,082 --> 01:09:38,792
Puerto Rico.

2077
01:09:38,922 --> 01:09:40,951
- Moo Sung.
- Puerto Rico.

2078
01:09:40,952 --> 01:09:42,721
- What did you say?
- Belgium.

2079
01:09:42,722 --> 01:09:44,991
- Belgium, France, Germany.
- How are we supposed to do this?

2080
01:09:44,992 --> 01:09:47,191
- Brazil.
- The Republic of South Africa.

2081
01:09:47,192 --> 01:09:48,392
The Republic of South Africa.

2082
01:09:48,902 --> 01:09:50,432
- Zimbabwe.
- How are we supposed to do this?

2083
01:09:50,502 --> 01:09:51,602
All right.

2084
01:09:52,132 --> 01:09:53,501
- The names won't be that hard.
- Let's do this.

2085
01:09:53,502 --> 01:09:54,801
- Let's begin.
- We're starting with Dong Hwi.

2086
01:09:54,802 --> 01:09:56,342
Yes, this way.

2087
01:09:57,702 --> 01:09:59,311
- In 1, 2, 3.
- Greece.

2088
01:09:59,312 --> 01:10:01,982
- Correct.
- Gosh, that was a hard one.

2089
01:10:02,612 --> 01:10:03,811
- In 1, 2, 3.
- Canada.

2090
01:10:03,812 --> 01:10:04,812
- Correct.
- Nice.

2091
01:10:04,982 --> 01:10:06,852
(The supervisor nailed it effortlessly.)

2092
01:10:07,782 --> 01:10:09,322
In 1, 2, 3.

2093
01:10:09,382 --> 01:10:11,282
(This was one of the supervisor's predicted questions!)

2094
01:10:11,352 --> 01:10:13,151
In 1, 2, 3. Wrong!

2095
01:10:13,152 --> 01:10:14,822
This one's so difficult.

2096
01:10:15,662 --> 01:10:18,122
It was one of the countries we mentioned earlier.

2097
01:10:18,222 --> 01:10:20,032
(The screen isn't frozen.)

2098
01:10:20,332 --> 01:10:22,601
The Republic of South Africa! I told you!

2099
01:10:22,602 --> 01:10:24,732
You should have whispered it to me!

2100
01:10:25,172 --> 01:10:27,131
How am I supposed to hear you mutter?

2101
01:10:27,132 --> 01:10:28,172
No, when we were practicing earlier.

2102
01:10:28,232 --> 01:10:30,141
(Seeing the fathers so invested in the game...)

2103
01:10:30,142 --> 01:10:32,072
(makes the sons laugh out loud.)

2104
01:10:32,172 --> 01:10:33,871
We can't keep doing this.

2105
01:10:33,872 --> 01:10:36,112
That one's so long and complex.

2106
01:10:36,182 --> 01:10:37,381
Let's do countries one more time.

2107
01:10:37,382 --> 01:10:38,511
Countries one more time?

2108
01:10:38,512 --> 01:10:40,382
- Right. Countries one more time.
- Out of the ones we mentioned.

2109
01:10:41,852 --> 01:10:43,351
You should think about this.

2110
01:10:43,352 --> 01:10:44,981
There are other categories too.

2111
01:10:44,982 --> 01:10:47,892
That doesn't mean we get extra chances, right?

2112
01:10:48,052 --> 01:10:50,321
We'll see what the remaining categories are, then.

2113
01:10:50,322 --> 01:10:51,821
- What are the remaining categories?
- Right.

2114
01:10:51,822 --> 01:10:53,331
We'll decide after we hear what they are.

2115
01:10:53,332 --> 01:10:54,731
- What's left?
- Show us.

2116
01:10:54,732 --> 01:10:56,431
Just spread them out. Show us once.

2117
01:10:56,432 --> 01:10:57,802
(No way.)

2118
01:10:57,962 --> 01:10:59,931
Countries could be very difficult.

2119
01:10:59,932 --> 01:11:01,201
- You think?
- I think so too.

2120
01:11:01,202 --> 01:11:02,801
- Okay, then we won't do it.
- Should we move on, then?

2121
01:11:02,802 --> 01:11:03,841
- All right.
- That would be better.

2122
01:11:03,842 --> 01:11:05,611
- Okay.
- I'll show you the next category.

2123
01:11:05,612 --> 01:11:07,341
- Whatever you've prepared.
- Let's move on right away.

2124
01:11:07,342 --> 01:11:08,442
We'll begin right away.

2125
01:11:08,742 --> 01:11:09,882
The next category is...

2126
01:11:10,182 --> 01:11:11,741
- animals.
- Animals?

2127
01:11:11,742 --> 01:11:13,152
Someone start saying difficult animal names.

2128
01:11:13,452 --> 01:11:14,512
Let's begin right away.

2129
01:11:15,352 --> 01:11:17,421
- In 1, 2, 3.
- Tiger.

2130
01:11:17,422 --> 01:11:18,792
- Correct.
- That's easy.

2131
01:11:19,522 --> 01:11:20,651
- In 1, 2, 3.
- Hippopotamus.

2132
01:11:20,652 --> 01:11:21,722
- Nice.
- Correct.

2133
01:11:22,092 --> 01:11:23,792
(Nice!)

2134
01:11:24,992 --> 01:11:26,532
In 1, 2, 3.

2135
01:11:26,792 --> 01:11:28,162
- Wrong!
- Darn it.

2136
01:11:28,392 --> 01:11:29,932
I said "hye."

2137
01:11:30,332 --> 01:11:31,432
- Hye.
- Wrong.

2138
01:11:32,002 --> 01:11:33,272
- Hye.
- Hyena.

2139
01:11:33,432 --> 01:11:34,602
(Too late. Bye.)

2140
01:11:35,132 --> 01:11:36,171
This is hard.

2141
01:11:36,172 --> 01:11:37,502
Why do I keep getting the hard ones?

2142
01:11:37,902 --> 01:11:39,011
It happens to me too.

2143
01:11:39,012 --> 01:11:40,871
I keep thinking "Gosh, I don't know that, either."

2144
01:11:40,872 --> 01:11:43,841
When we go on to the next category, just like we did with countries,

2145
01:11:43,842 --> 01:11:46,151
we should keep brainstorming out loud.

2146
01:11:46,152 --> 01:11:47,311
Right. We should think of the tough ones.

2147
01:11:47,312 --> 01:11:48,751
Is this our last chance?

2148
01:11:48,752 --> 01:11:50,582
- Yes. We have two?
- You have two left.

2149
01:11:50,852 --> 01:11:51,991
Should we change seats?

2150
01:11:51,992 --> 01:11:54,592
- Should we change seats?
- Isn't Moo Sung so bad at this?

2151
01:11:55,122 --> 01:11:56,261
Then why don't we...

2152
01:11:56,262 --> 01:11:58,162
Hyena was a tough one.

2153
01:11:58,322 --> 01:11:59,531
I mean, he had no choice.

2154
01:11:59,532 --> 01:12:00,631
Score-wise, they were difficult ones.

2155
01:12:00,632 --> 01:12:02,302
- Kyung Pyo, you come here.
- I thought about it,

2156
01:12:02,402 --> 01:12:05,372
and, at the end of the day, if you get it wrong, we fail.

2157
01:12:05,602 --> 01:12:07,271
He can still get it right once.

2158
01:12:07,272 --> 01:12:09,201
I think if he's over there,

2159
01:12:09,202 --> 01:12:10,641
- he'll get used to it.
- The thought process?

2160
01:12:10,642 --> 01:12:11,942
All right.

2161
01:12:12,042 --> 01:12:13,571
Let's change seats.

2162
01:12:13,572 --> 01:12:15,612
But now, after you answer, you have to go again right away.

2163
01:12:15,782 --> 01:12:17,642
- No, he can't!
- You should sit over here.

2164
01:12:17,882 --> 01:12:19,181
(Turning pale with shock)

2165
01:12:19,182 --> 01:12:20,182
- Wait.
- You should sit over here.

2166
01:12:20,183 --> 01:12:21,451
That can't happen.

2167
01:12:21,452 --> 01:12:23,251
- The two of you should change.
- Let's try it once.

2168
01:12:23,252 --> 01:12:24,351
All we have to do is get through.

2169
01:12:24,352 --> 01:12:26,322
The two of you can switch seats.

2170
01:12:26,592 --> 01:12:27,992
Me? I can't do that.

2171
01:12:28,252 --> 01:12:30,422
- What should we do then?
- I don't know. Let's just go.

2172
01:12:31,262 --> 01:12:32,591
Why don't we do this?

2173
01:12:32,592 --> 01:12:33,791
- What?
- We'll show you the category...

2174
01:12:33,792 --> 01:12:35,461
and give you time to brainstorm.

2175
01:12:35,462 --> 01:12:36,901
- That sounds good.
- All right.

2176
01:12:36,902 --> 01:12:38,261
You should give us ten seconds.

2177
01:12:38,262 --> 01:12:40,071
We'll give you ten seconds. Once we tell you the category,

2178
01:12:40,072 --> 01:12:41,101
- We'll count 10 seconds.
- Okay, 10 seconds.

2179
01:12:41,102 --> 01:12:42,901
- You can talk during that time.
- Okay.

2180
01:12:42,902 --> 01:12:43,941
- That's great.
- Okay.

2181
01:12:43,942 --> 01:12:45,671
- You focus on the tough ones.
- Okay.

2182
01:12:45,672 --> 01:12:46,672
The long ones.

2183
01:12:46,812 --> 01:12:48,342
- Listen carefully, okay?
- Okay.

2184
01:12:48,612 --> 01:12:49,711
Let's do this.

2185
01:12:49,712 --> 01:12:51,441
All right. We'll tell you the category first.

2186
01:12:51,442 --> 01:12:53,352
- Take your time to predict.
- All right.

2187
01:12:53,512 --> 01:12:55,621
- The category is names of ramyeon.
- Ramyeon.

2188
01:12:55,622 --> 01:12:56,651
Someone should say something.

2189
01:12:56,652 --> 01:12:58,321
- Wait.
- Yukgaejang.

2190
01:12:58,322 --> 01:13:00,491
- Shin Ramyeon, Jin Ramyeon.
- Jin Jjamppong.

2191
01:13:00,492 --> 01:13:02,191
- You have eight seconds left.
- Jin Jjamppong.

2192
01:13:02,192 --> 01:13:03,761
- What else? Ansungtangmyeon.
- Bibimmyeon...

2193
01:13:03,762 --> 01:13:05,291
- It ends with "Tangmyeon." - Paldo Bibimmyeon.

2194
01:13:05,292 --> 01:13:06,631
- Sagol Gomtang?
- Tempura Udon.

2195
01:13:06,632 --> 01:13:08,061
- Tempura Udon.
- Buldak Ramyeon.

2196
01:13:08,062 --> 01:13:09,701
- Shin Ramyeon.
- Buldak Ramyeon.

2197
01:13:09,702 --> 01:13:11,161
- Buldak Carbonara.
- Buldak Carbonara.

2198
01:13:11,162 --> 01:13:12,532
- What?
- Time's up.

2199
01:13:12,602 --> 01:13:13,831
Buldak Carbonara.

2200
01:13:13,832 --> 01:13:15,202
- Let's begin.
- This category is difficult.

2201
01:13:16,402 --> 01:13:18,141
- In 1, 2, 3.
- Neoguri.

2202
01:13:18,142 --> 01:13:19,542
- Correct.
- That was tough.

2203
01:13:19,872 --> 01:13:20,941
That was tough.

2204
01:13:20,942 --> 01:13:22,182
You got this.

2205
01:13:23,212 --> 01:13:24,681
- In 1, 2, 3.
- Mupama.

2206
01:13:24,682 --> 01:13:25,712
- Okay!
- Correct!

2207
01:13:26,112 --> 01:13:27,451
What else is there? I don't know anything.

2208
01:13:27,452 --> 01:13:28,452
- In one...
- Chapagetti.

2209
01:13:28,453 --> 01:13:29,582
- Nice!
- Correct.

2210
01:13:29,622 --> 01:13:30,982
(Things are going smoothly.)

2211
01:13:32,022 --> 01:13:33,651
In 1, 2, 3.

2212
01:13:33,652 --> 01:13:34,752
- Sagol Gomtang.
- Okay.

2213
01:13:34,922 --> 01:13:36,191
- Wrong!
- It's Sari Gomtang!

2214
01:13:36,192 --> 01:13:37,362
- It's Sari Gomtang!
- Sari Gomtang!

2215
01:13:38,092 --> 01:13:39,662
- Okay! What?
- Wrong!

2216
01:13:39,862 --> 01:13:41,132
It's Sari Gomtang!

2217
01:13:42,332 --> 01:13:43,761
Wait.

2218
01:13:43,762 --> 01:13:45,502
- Did you say Sagol Gomtang?
- No!

2219
01:13:45,672 --> 01:13:47,232
They're the same thing!

2220
01:13:47,402 --> 01:13:48,632
This is tough.

2221
01:13:49,142 --> 01:13:51,242
Sagol Gomtang and Sari Gomtang.

2222
01:13:51,472 --> 01:13:53,271
- The milky beef soup.
- But that is...

2223
01:13:53,272 --> 01:13:55,242
(The unexpected ox bone is driving them crazy.)

2224
01:13:55,582 --> 01:13:56,681
Hold on.

2225
01:13:56,682 --> 01:13:59,251
- Only me and my son...
- He must be under pressure.

2226
01:13:59,252 --> 01:14:01,111
(Only the two of them keep getting it wrong.)

2227
01:14:01,112 --> 01:14:02,981
- Sorry.
- The next one.

2228
01:14:02,982 --> 01:14:04,852
- That's the only thing written.
- No, after Sari Gomtang.

2229
01:14:04,952 --> 01:14:06,422
- Let's experiment with it.
- Let's give it a try.

2230
01:14:07,392 --> 01:14:08,961
In 1, 2, 3.

2231
01:14:08,962 --> 01:14:10,422
- An...
- Ansungtangmyeon.

2232
01:14:10,662 --> 01:14:11,761
(Amazed)

2233
01:14:11,762 --> 01:14:13,062
- Sun Young goes last.
- I have no idea.

2234
01:14:13,632 --> 01:14:15,662
In 1, 2, 3.

2235
01:14:16,162 --> 01:14:17,661
- Even I have no idea.
- This is...

2236
01:14:17,662 --> 01:14:19,401
- Teumsae Ramyeon.
- Oh, I didn't know.

2237
01:14:19,402 --> 01:14:20,501
(Exclaiming)

2238
01:14:20,502 --> 01:14:21,731
We were going to fail anyway.

2239
01:14:21,732 --> 01:14:22,941
- We were going to fail anyway.
- We were going to fail anyway.

2240
01:14:22,942 --> 01:14:24,171
- No one could get it.
- I didn't know there was one.

2241
01:14:24,172 --> 01:14:26,011
- I've tried Teumsae Ramyeon.
- I've heard of it.

2242
01:14:26,012 --> 01:14:27,741
It's hard. I didn't know.

2243
01:14:27,742 --> 01:14:28,781
Sun Young would've ended it anyway.

2244
01:14:28,782 --> 01:14:30,381
- Or I'll go first.
- Yes.

2245
01:14:30,382 --> 01:14:32,752
- It's easier at first.
- Right.

2246
01:14:32,852 --> 01:14:34,952
- I'll switch with Bo Gum.
- Okay.

2247
01:14:35,252 --> 01:14:36,351
Then...

2248
01:14:36,352 --> 01:14:37,651
is this the last chance?

2249
01:14:37,652 --> 01:14:38,652
Yes, this is your last chance.

2250
01:14:38,653 --> 01:14:40,522
Does that mean we have to wear this?

2251
01:14:40,652 --> 01:14:42,821
You'll move to Goseong in that outfit.

2252
01:14:42,822 --> 01:14:43,992
This is really embarrassing.

2253
01:14:44,192 --> 01:14:46,092
I'm sorry. I really am.

2254
01:14:46,192 --> 01:14:47,331
- No.
- No.

2255
01:14:47,332 --> 01:14:49,301
I couldn't answer Teumsae Ramyeon anyway.

2256
01:14:49,302 --> 01:14:51,602
This isn't an absurd suggestion.

2257
01:14:51,862 --> 01:14:54,432
(What is it this time?)

2258
01:14:54,702 --> 01:14:56,272
Can I say, "Wait?"

2259
01:14:57,002 --> 01:14:59,041
- "Wait?" - What for?

2260
01:14:59,042 --> 01:15:00,071
- When?
- What for?

2261
01:15:00,072 --> 01:15:01,442
What? Are you waiting for the signal?

2262
01:15:01,512 --> 01:15:02,742
For example...

2263
01:15:03,242 --> 01:15:04,611
Before you take it out,

2264
01:15:04,612 --> 01:15:06,881
say, "Wait," because we get worked up.

2265
01:15:06,882 --> 01:15:07,952
My heartbeat...

2266
01:15:08,312 --> 01:15:10,481
- Then only one at a time.
- My heartbeat rises.

2267
01:15:10,482 --> 01:15:11,882
If one person uses it, no one else can.

2268
01:15:12,052 --> 01:15:13,452
Can someone else say it for others?

2269
01:15:13,752 --> 01:15:15,522
- Yes.
- Okay.

2270
01:15:15,622 --> 01:15:16,821
- Say, "Time out." - "Time out."

2271
01:15:16,822 --> 01:15:19,132
- But only once.
- Okay.

2272
01:15:19,632 --> 01:15:21,092
Why am I getting nervous?

2273
01:15:21,762 --> 01:15:23,302
If you get nervous, say, "Wait."

2274
01:15:24,402 --> 01:15:25,801
It feels like I'm at my relative's house.

2275
01:15:25,802 --> 01:15:27,002
- Everyone...
- So cute.

2276
01:15:27,102 --> 01:15:30,072
- doesn't know what to do.
- Seriously...

2277
01:15:30,472 --> 01:15:31,701
Since this is your last chance,

2278
01:15:31,702 --> 01:15:33,541
it'll be one way.

2279
01:15:33,542 --> 01:15:35,511
- Oh, yes! Good.
- That's good.

2280
01:15:35,512 --> 01:15:38,582
- But I'll count to three exactly.
- Okay.

2281
01:15:38,812 --> 01:15:39,981
- All right.
- Let's start.

2282
01:15:39,982 --> 01:15:41,112
- We can do it.
- This is our last chance.

2283
01:15:42,552 --> 01:15:43,721
I'll tell you the category...

2284
01:15:43,722 --> 01:15:45,352
- and give you time to discuss.
- Okay.

2285
01:15:45,422 --> 01:15:46,751
- I'll show you.
- Okay.

2286
01:15:46,752 --> 01:15:47,791
- This is the last round.
- Sports.

2287
01:15:47,792 --> 01:15:49,662
Baseball, dodge ball, baseball, or...

2288
01:15:49,792 --> 01:15:51,291
- wrestling.
- Wrestling.

2289
01:15:51,292 --> 01:15:52,292
What else?

2290
01:15:52,293 --> 01:15:53,532
- Handball.
- Handball.

2291
01:15:53,892 --> 01:15:55,331
- Foot baseball.
- Foot baseball.

2292
01:15:55,332 --> 01:15:56,431
- Soccer.
- Soccer.

2293
01:15:56,432 --> 01:15:57,661
- Football.
- Ice hockey.

2294
01:15:57,662 --> 01:15:58,831
- Ice hockey.
- What's that called?

2295
01:15:58,832 --> 01:15:59,871
The one you play with your feet.

2296
01:15:59,872 --> 01:16:01,501
- Hockey...
- Spectacle...

2297
01:16:01,502 --> 01:16:03,241
- Spec...
- Beach volleyball.

2298
01:16:03,242 --> 01:16:04,471
- Handball.
- What is that?

2299
01:16:04,472 --> 01:16:05,671
- Sepaktakraw.
- Sepaktakraw.

2300
01:16:05,672 --> 01:16:07,411
- Sepaktakraw?
- Sepaktakraw.

2301
01:16:07,412 --> 01:16:09,041
- Sepaktakraw.
- Sepaktakraw.

2302
01:16:09,042 --> 01:16:10,082
Get ready.

2303
01:16:10,112 --> 01:16:11,241
- But don't just focus on that.
- All right.

2304
01:16:11,242 --> 01:16:12,282
- Focus.
- Let's start.

2305
01:16:12,882 --> 01:16:14,352
- Badminton.
- Correct.

2306
01:16:14,912 --> 01:16:16,022
Let's go.

2307
01:16:16,052 --> 01:16:17,452
In 1, 2, 3.

2308
01:16:17,582 --> 01:16:18,751
- Wrong.
- That...

2309
01:16:18,752 --> 01:16:20,122
Table tennis.

2310
01:16:21,122 --> 01:16:23,021
(Failing to receive)

2311
01:16:23,022 --> 01:16:24,362
Table tennis.

2312
01:16:24,792 --> 01:16:25,792
Jae Myung!

2313
01:16:25,793 --> 01:16:26,831
(Jae Myung, the ace collapses in the last round.)

2314
01:16:26,832 --> 01:16:27,992
You said table tennis.

2315
01:16:28,092 --> 01:16:29,461
(When?)

2316
01:16:29,462 --> 01:16:30,501
Did you?

2317
01:16:30,502 --> 01:16:32,272
I did. I went, "Table tennis."

2318
01:16:32,472 --> 01:16:33,502
Table tennis.

2319
01:16:33,872 --> 01:16:35,332
- What?
- But I heard it.

2320
01:16:35,702 --> 01:16:37,472
He also made the table tennis gesture.

2321
01:16:37,542 --> 01:16:39,172
He went, "Table tennis!"

2322
01:16:39,572 --> 01:16:40,971
- He has to say it accurately.
- I heard the T in table tennis.

2323
01:16:40,972 --> 01:16:42,941
- But that was...
- "Table tennis!"

2324
01:16:42,942 --> 01:16:44,542
He didn't say it out loud.

2325
01:16:44,682 --> 01:16:45,881
When one is certain,

2326
01:16:45,882 --> 01:16:48,481
- he gets worked up.
- Right.

2327
01:16:48,482 --> 01:16:49,752
"Table tennis."

2328
01:16:49,952 --> 01:16:51,582
- Did you hear that too?
- I did.

2329
01:16:52,392 --> 01:16:53,851
- I'm serious.
- For real.

2330
01:16:53,852 --> 01:16:55,292
(Their method acting makes him cry.)

2331
01:16:55,522 --> 01:16:58,292
(Wasting their talents for no good)

2332
01:16:58,422 --> 01:16:59,861
I want the VAR.

2333
01:16:59,862 --> 01:17:01,992
The VAR. We need to see it.

2334
01:17:02,192 --> 01:17:03,632
(VAR verifying)

2335
01:17:03,762 --> 01:17:05,771
(Stuttering)

2336
01:17:05,772 --> 01:17:07,832
(No T in table tennis is said.)

2337
01:17:08,172 --> 01:17:10,401
What else does this other than table tennis?

2338
01:17:10,402 --> 01:17:12,772
I'm sorry. I didn't say it. Sorry.

2339
01:17:12,972 --> 01:17:14,171
He didn't say it out loud.

2340
01:17:14,172 --> 01:17:16,211
- He didn't say it.
- Well,

2341
01:17:16,212 --> 01:17:18,411
I said the Ts,

2342
01:17:18,412 --> 01:17:19,712
but I went, "T..."

2343
01:17:21,052 --> 01:17:22,522
- "T..." - Sorry.

2344
01:17:23,052 --> 01:17:24,652
- Actually...
- By chance,

2345
01:17:25,352 --> 01:17:28,292
if I play alone and get everything right,

2346
01:17:28,552 --> 01:17:31,022
(A hero in a turbulent age?)

2347
01:17:31,192 --> 01:17:32,592
can I get changed alone?

2348
01:17:34,092 --> 01:17:35,631
- An individual round?
- Hey.

2349
01:17:35,632 --> 01:17:36,902
Because this is embarrassing.

2350
01:17:36,932 --> 01:17:39,102
- If I get all 10 questions alone, - Only if you get all 10.

2351
01:17:39,202 --> 01:17:40,231
this is really...

2352
01:17:40,232 --> 01:17:41,572
No, this is what we should do.

2353
01:17:41,632 --> 01:17:43,541
If you get it, we all get changed.

2354
01:17:43,542 --> 01:17:45,572
(If he's wrong, everyone sticks to the current outfit.)

2355
01:17:45,672 --> 01:17:47,042
- That's a good idea.
- That's what we should do.

2356
01:17:47,372 --> 01:17:48,411
If he succeeds,

2357
01:17:48,412 --> 01:17:49,412
- we all get changed.
- Do you...

2358
01:17:49,413 --> 01:17:50,441
If you don't, you wear it alone.

2359
01:17:50,442 --> 01:17:51,942
watch variety shows a lot at home?

2360
01:17:52,752 --> 01:17:53,881
That's amazing.

2361
01:17:53,882 --> 01:17:55,181
That way, it's only more fun.

2362
01:17:55,182 --> 01:17:57,022
- I think that's a good idea.
- That's a good idea.

2363
01:17:57,252 --> 01:17:58,652
- I'll do that.
- I knew it.

2364
01:17:58,722 --> 01:18:00,951
(Dong Hwi's sudden challenge)

2365
01:18:00,952 --> 01:18:02,221
(Bonus round. If he succeeds, everyone gets changed.)

2366
01:18:02,222 --> 01:18:03,391
(If he fails, no one can get changed.)

2367
01:18:03,392 --> 01:18:04,592
(Their budget is 12 dollars.)

2368
01:18:04,862 --> 01:18:05,991
- I won't be able to do it.
- And...

2369
01:18:05,992 --> 01:18:07,291
- Don't say that. You can do it.
- regardless of your outfits,

2370
01:18:07,292 --> 01:18:09,432
your budget is 12 dollars.

2371
01:18:09,562 --> 01:18:12,602
Then are we all sharing 12 dollars?

2372
01:18:12,702 --> 01:18:13,772
That's right.

2373
01:18:14,002 --> 01:18:16,002
Right. Consider we don't have any money.

2374
01:18:16,042 --> 01:18:17,201
- Okay.
- That's not bad.

2375
01:18:17,202 --> 01:18:18,842
- As long as we get to change.
- Yes, let's get changed.

2376
01:18:18,902 --> 01:18:20,812
Relax.

2377
01:18:21,312 --> 01:18:24,211
- You can get them all.
- It's ten questions in a row.

2378
01:18:24,212 --> 01:18:25,481
- The category is...
- The same one?

2379
01:18:25,482 --> 01:18:27,052
- sports.
- It's the same.

2380
01:18:27,612 --> 01:18:28,752
You can do it, Dong Hwi.

2381
01:18:29,222 --> 01:18:30,722
- Golf?
- Okay.

2382
01:18:30,752 --> 01:18:32,052
- Let's go.
- Swimming.

2383
01:18:32,392 --> 01:18:34,621
(Will he get all 10 answers right by himself?)

2384
01:18:34,622 --> 01:18:35,762
Here we go.

2385
01:18:37,198 --> 01:18:38,797
- Golf?
- Okay.

2386
01:18:38,798 --> 01:18:40,138
- Let's go.
- Swimming.

2387
01:18:40,368 --> 01:18:42,538
(Will he get all 10 answers right by himself?)

2388
01:18:42,578 --> 01:18:43,638
Here we go.

2389
01:18:44,378 --> 01:18:45,747
One, two, three.

2390
01:18:45,748 --> 01:18:46,978
- Soccer.
- Correct.

2391
01:18:47,008 --> 01:18:48,308
Good. You're laid-back.

2392
01:18:48,948 --> 01:18:50,417
In 1, 2, 3.

2393
01:18:50,418 --> 01:18:51,548
- Hockey.
- Correct.

2394
01:18:52,888 --> 01:18:54,047
In 1, 2, 3.

2395
01:18:54,048 --> 01:18:55,218
- Swimming.
- Correct.

2396
01:18:55,488 --> 01:18:56,888
(Good job, my son.)

2397
01:18:57,458 --> 01:18:58,587
In 1, 2, 3.

2398
01:18:58,588 --> 01:18:59,788
- Tennis.
- Correct.

2399
01:19:01,028 --> 01:19:02,127
In 1, 2, 3.

2400
01:19:02,128 --> 01:19:03,358
- Basketball.
- Correct.

2401
01:19:03,498 --> 01:19:05,998
(Only five more to go)

2402
01:19:06,728 --> 01:19:07,867
In 1, 2, 3.

2403
01:19:07,868 --> 01:19:09,028
- Golf.
- Correct.

2404
01:19:09,138 --> 01:19:10,298
- Golf?
- Correct.

2405
01:19:12,538 --> 01:19:13,807
In 1, 2, 3.

2406
01:19:13,808 --> 01:19:15,237
- Volleyball?
- Wrong.

2407
01:19:15,238 --> 01:19:16,807
- That...
- What is that?

2408
01:19:16,808 --> 01:19:17,838
Bowling.

2409
01:19:18,038 --> 01:19:19,577
- It's bowling.
- My goodness.

2410
01:19:19,578 --> 01:19:20,748
That was so close.

2411
01:19:21,108 --> 01:19:22,977
- Wrong.
- Isn't he amazing?

2412
01:19:22,978 --> 01:19:24,447
- You were so close.
- That was his sixth one.

2413
01:19:24,448 --> 01:19:25,748
How many did he have left?

2414
01:19:26,148 --> 01:19:27,917
- Only three more.
- Bowling.

2415
01:19:27,918 --> 01:19:29,048
Bowling.

2416
01:19:29,458 --> 01:19:30,517
But...

2417
01:19:30,518 --> 01:19:31,917
(About to be stuck in 1988)

2418
01:19:31,918 --> 01:19:34,728
It was confusing. Volley was confusing.

2419
01:19:34,858 --> 01:19:36,657
Oh, my gosh. He was so good.

2420
01:19:36,658 --> 01:19:37,697
It's such a shame.

2421
01:19:37,698 --> 01:19:39,428
Why don't we have the seniors play?

2422
01:19:40,698 --> 01:19:42,798
Why do you keep saying that?

2423
01:19:42,868 --> 01:19:44,768
Then...

2424
01:19:45,068 --> 01:19:47,267
- if he gets the rest...
- Why me?

2425
01:19:47,268 --> 01:19:49,277
- I'm not doing it.
- No, wait.

2426
01:19:49,278 --> 01:19:50,537
- I don't want to.
- We...

2427
01:19:50,538 --> 01:19:52,447
- Since Dong Hwi did it for us, - Right.

2428
01:19:52,448 --> 01:19:53,748
let's save Dong Hwi.

2429
01:19:53,848 --> 01:19:55,348
- Good.
- Good.

2430
01:19:55,378 --> 01:19:57,047
Because everyone in Ssangmun-dong is united.

2431
01:19:57,048 --> 01:19:58,547
- Ssangmun-dong unites us.
- That's good.

2432
01:19:58,548 --> 01:20:00,117
Yes, let's save Dong Hwi.

2433
01:20:00,118 --> 01:20:01,447
- I...
- Moo Sung, let's do it.

2434
01:20:01,448 --> 01:20:02,887
- So we can save Dong Hwi.
- Moo Sung, let's do it.

2435
01:20:02,888 --> 01:20:03,918
- Why me?
- No.

2436
01:20:03,988 --> 01:20:07,057
Taek's dad looked after Dong Ryong a lot.

2437
01:20:07,058 --> 01:20:08,457
- I'm serious.
- Why me?

2438
01:20:08,458 --> 01:20:09,597
Let's do it.

2439
01:20:09,598 --> 01:20:10,758
Then...

2440
01:20:10,858 --> 01:20:11,997
how about the three adults?

2441
01:20:11,998 --> 01:20:13,728
- The 3 adults.
- The 3 adults.

2442
01:20:14,128 --> 01:20:16,237
The three adults. Okay.

2443
01:20:16,238 --> 01:20:17,297
Okay.

2444
01:20:17,298 --> 01:20:18,697
(The sons quickly switch.)

2445
01:20:18,698 --> 01:20:20,238
But I don't want to do it.

2446
01:20:21,308 --> 01:20:22,837
- Please do it for me.
- Yes.

2447
01:20:22,838 --> 01:20:24,177
I really want to do it for him.

2448
01:20:24,178 --> 01:20:25,277
Okay. Let's try.

2449
01:20:25,278 --> 01:20:26,278
Please do it for me.

2450
01:20:26,279 --> 01:20:27,747
This is the last round. Let's keep it neat.

2451
01:20:27,748 --> 01:20:29,007
Yes, it's the last round for real.

2452
01:20:29,008 --> 01:20:30,947
- Only then it's fun to watch.
- Okay.

2453
01:20:30,948 --> 01:20:32,117
(If they succeed, everyone gets changed.)

2454
01:20:32,118 --> 01:20:33,188
(If they fail, no one gets changed.)

2455
01:20:33,218 --> 01:20:34,547
- What's the question?
- All right.

2456
01:20:34,548 --> 01:20:35,787
- Both ways.
- Good.

2457
01:20:35,788 --> 01:20:37,217
Five seconds. The end.

2458
01:20:37,218 --> 01:20:38,787
- Okay.
- Okay.

2459
01:20:38,788 --> 01:20:40,087
- Both ways for five seconds.
- Please.

2460
01:20:40,088 --> 01:20:42,328
- We're bad at it.
- Five seconds.

2461
01:20:42,358 --> 01:20:43,657
- Both ways.
- I'll count to five accurately.

2462
01:20:43,658 --> 01:20:44,758
- Both ways.
- Okay.

2463
01:20:44,898 --> 01:20:46,498
- You can do it. Good luck.
- Good luck.

2464
01:20:46,998 --> 01:20:48,198
I should've left out.

2465
01:20:48,868 --> 01:20:50,297
No, Dad.

2466
01:20:50,298 --> 01:20:51,298
(The people of Ssangmun-dong are of one mind.)

2467
01:20:51,299 --> 01:20:53,267
- Let's see it first.
- Okay.

2468
01:20:53,268 --> 01:20:54,307
Here's the category.

2469
01:20:54,308 --> 01:20:55,878
- It's the cafe menu.
- What?

2470
01:20:55,938 --> 01:20:57,377
- This is bad.
- No.

2471
01:20:57,378 --> 01:20:59,607
- I don't know anything.
- Say something.

2472
01:20:59,608 --> 01:21:01,007
(For their discouraged parents, they quickly provide the cafe menu.)

2473
01:21:01,008 --> 01:21:02,277
Even if they look at it, they can't do it.

2474
01:21:02,278 --> 01:21:04,678
Wait. Americano. Vanilla latte.

2475
01:21:04,878 --> 01:21:07,417
(Too discouraged to study)

2476
01:21:07,418 --> 01:21:08,587
- Einspanner.
- Moo Sung, memorize it.

2477
01:21:08,588 --> 01:21:10,417
- Peach udon tea.
- Einspanner.

2478
01:21:10,418 --> 01:21:13,028
- All I know is Americano.
- Einspanner?

2479
01:21:13,058 --> 01:21:14,428
But it's not from this place, is it?

2480
01:21:14,888 --> 01:21:16,357
- No, just the regular menu.
- Grapefruit honey black tea.

2481
01:21:16,358 --> 01:21:17,397
- Affogato.
- The regular items.

2482
01:21:17,398 --> 01:21:18,957
- Avogato.
- Affogato.

2483
01:21:18,958 --> 01:21:20,067
- Affogato.
- Not avocado. Affogato.

2484
01:21:20,068 --> 01:21:21,767
- Affogato.
- Affogato. What else?

2485
01:21:21,768 --> 01:21:23,767
- Einspanner.
- Einspanner.

2486
01:21:23,768 --> 01:21:25,867
- All I know is Americano.
- Moo Sung.

2487
01:21:25,868 --> 01:21:28,107
Memorize it. You need to try hard.

2488
01:21:28,108 --> 01:21:29,707
- How can I do that all of a sudden?
- Einspanner.

2489
01:21:29,708 --> 01:21:31,307
- Let's stand in the back.
- Hot chocolate.

2490
01:21:31,308 --> 01:21:32,377
Where? Are you coming to tell us?

2491
01:21:32,378 --> 01:21:34,207
- No, to support you.
- To support you.

2492
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:36,017
- We're here to support you.
- You can do it.

2493
01:21:36,018 --> 01:21:37,717
- To support you.
- Cafe latte.

2494
01:21:37,718 --> 01:21:38,977
Caramel latte. Yuzu tea.

2495
01:21:38,978 --> 01:21:41,047
(The sons look more nervous than their parents.)

2496
01:21:41,048 --> 01:21:42,187
Moo Sung, hurry up and memorize it.

2497
01:21:42,188 --> 01:21:43,587
- Memorize it.
- For him...

2498
01:21:43,588 --> 01:21:44,987
- What was that?
- Einspanner?

2499
01:21:44,988 --> 01:21:46,027
- Einspanner.
- Einspanner.

2500
01:21:46,028 --> 01:21:47,128
Let's go.

2501
01:21:47,628 --> 01:21:50,028
- I'll count to five.
- I'm counting on you.

2502
01:21:50,058 --> 01:21:51,098
But why...

2503
01:21:51,798 --> 01:21:52,898
Here we go.

2504
01:21:52,968 --> 01:21:54,497
- In 1, 2...
- Green tea.

2505
01:21:54,498 --> 01:21:55,628
Correct.

2506
01:21:56,638 --> 01:21:57,697
- In one...
- Americano.

2507
01:21:57,698 --> 01:21:58,738
- Okay.
- Correct.

2508
01:21:59,038 --> 01:22:00,408
(Focusing on one item worked.)

2509
01:22:01,268 --> 01:22:02,578
- Cafe latte.
- Correct.

2510
01:22:03,538 --> 01:22:06,008
(Surprised by her loud voice)

2511
01:22:06,608 --> 01:22:08,107
In 1, 2...

2512
01:22:08,108 --> 01:22:09,948
(Wait, that is...)

2513
01:22:10,218 --> 01:22:12,517
Three, four, five.

2514
01:22:12,518 --> 01:22:14,117
- Red bean shaved ice.
- Correct.

2515
01:22:14,118 --> 01:22:15,118
(Buzzer beater)

2516
01:22:15,119 --> 01:22:16,557
(Gasping)

2517
01:22:16,558 --> 01:22:17,818
(Good job, Dad.)

2518
01:22:18,118 --> 01:22:20,358
(Now, only the supervisor remains.)

2519
01:22:20,688 --> 01:22:22,187
- The last one. One...
- Cappuccino.

2520
01:22:22,188 --> 01:22:23,358
Correct.

2521
01:22:23,828 --> 01:22:26,698
(Ssangmun-dong Avengers did it.)

2522
01:22:26,768 --> 01:22:28,697
Dong Hwi!

2523
01:22:28,698 --> 01:22:30,168
(Mother!)

2524
01:22:30,438 --> 01:22:31,468
How did you know?

2525
01:22:32,098 --> 01:22:33,538
We did it. Dong Hwi.

2526
01:22:33,868 --> 01:22:35,008
Oh, red bean shaved ice.

2527
01:22:35,408 --> 01:22:36,907
- Why did you...
- Good job.

2528
01:22:36,908 --> 01:22:38,078
give me the hard one?

2529
01:22:38,978 --> 01:22:40,108
This is exciting.

2530
01:22:40,208 --> 01:22:41,407
(Yet they did it.)

2531
01:22:41,408 --> 01:22:43,618
- Red bean shaved ice...
- It was such a hard game.

2532
01:22:43,918 --> 01:22:46,217
- Thank you. Thank you so much.
- My goodness.

2533
01:22:46,218 --> 01:22:47,287
Dong Hwi.

2534
01:22:47,288 --> 01:22:48,747
- I almost felt bad for you.
- Thank you so much.

2535
01:22:48,748 --> 01:22:50,718
That was so close. Thank you.

2536
01:22:51,718 --> 01:22:53,728
- Let's move to the rest area.
- Let's go.

2537
01:22:53,928 --> 01:22:55,257
- That was hard.
- Good work.

2538
01:22:55,258 --> 01:22:56,328
Well done.

2539
01:22:56,728 --> 01:22:59,828
(The fun game is now over.)

2540
01:23:00,098 --> 01:23:02,397
(The 3 sons gathered.)

2541
01:23:02,398 --> 01:23:04,937
This is easy to take.

2542
01:23:04,938 --> 01:23:06,208
I'm familiar with it.

2543
01:23:06,838 --> 01:23:08,137
Take one each.

2544
01:23:08,138 --> 01:23:09,977
(Bo Gum takes care of them before the trip.)

2545
01:23:09,978 --> 01:23:11,607
I was just about to get tired. This is perfect.

2546
01:23:11,608 --> 01:23:12,948
I know. Everyone...

2547
01:23:13,348 --> 01:23:14,807
Thanks to Bo Gum...

2548
01:23:14,808 --> 01:23:18,017
I went to check my body type,

2549
01:23:18,018 --> 01:23:19,488
and I was told my body was cold.

2550
01:23:19,548 --> 01:23:21,818
It's best to boost your immune system.

2551
01:23:22,448 --> 01:23:23,857
Especially in the change of the season like now.

2552
01:23:23,858 --> 01:23:26,157
People with a cold body.

2553
01:23:26,158 --> 01:23:27,428
This is an easy way to take red ginseng.

2554
01:23:29,628 --> 01:23:31,557
I should get them for the seniors later.

2555
01:23:31,558 --> 01:23:33,197
I know. Let me...

2556
01:23:33,198 --> 01:23:34,667
give this to my dad.

2557
01:23:34,668 --> 01:23:35,928
(Taking his chance to be a good son)

2558
01:23:36,268 --> 01:23:37,738
I look forward to your cooperation today.

2559
01:23:41,368 --> 01:23:44,908
(Now that they're recharged, they set off.)

2560
01:23:44,938 --> 01:23:50,848
(Cafe, rest area, accommodation)

2561
01:23:51,118 --> 01:23:52,317
Well done, Dong Hwi.

2562
01:23:52,318 --> 01:23:53,518
Not at all.

2563
01:23:53,718 --> 01:23:54,817
(Sun Woo, Taek, and Dong Ryong's families arrive at the rest area.)

2564
01:23:54,818 --> 01:23:55,848
Let's hop off.

2565
01:23:57,058 --> 01:23:58,718
This isn't an ordinary rest area.

2566
01:23:58,888 --> 01:24:00,428
It is an ordinary rest area,

2567
01:24:00,628 --> 01:24:02,458
but it's pretty famous.

2568
01:24:03,098 --> 01:24:04,397
Did everyone leave already?

2569
01:24:04,398 --> 01:24:06,728
Right. I guess everyone left already.

2570
01:24:07,468 --> 01:24:10,168
This is very small.

2571
01:24:10,298 --> 01:24:12,068
If it were big,

2572
01:24:12,238 --> 01:24:13,667
there would be so much to eat.

2573
01:24:13,668 --> 01:24:14,807
We'd be upset that we couldn't eat them.

2574
01:24:14,808 --> 01:24:17,407
- But there's barely anything...
- Still, you'll find good stuff.

2575
01:24:17,408 --> 01:24:18,738
- What?
- You'll find delicious stuff.

2576
01:24:19,478 --> 01:24:21,508
(About this rest area located on the route,)

2577
01:24:22,178 --> 01:24:26,548
(it's the specialty of Route 44 with the retro vibe.)

2578
01:24:27,188 --> 01:24:29,558
(It looks small, but it has everything you need.)

2579
01:24:29,958 --> 01:24:31,858
(Starting with reminiscent snacks...)

2580
01:24:32,358 --> 01:24:34,658
(to the famous rest area snacks)

2581
01:24:34,688 --> 01:24:35,887
(Dried pollack soup)

2582
01:24:35,888 --> 01:24:37,497
(Jjajangmyeon)

2583
01:24:37,498 --> 01:24:38,758
(Fishcake udon)

2584
01:24:39,198 --> 01:24:40,928
(Bibimbap)

2585
01:24:41,498 --> 01:24:43,868
(It's the delicious rest area with an iron hand in a velvet glove.)

2586
01:24:44,368 --> 01:24:46,938
- They have corndogs.
- Right.

2587
01:24:48,538 --> 01:24:50,438
That can't be a meal, though.

2588
01:24:50,938 --> 01:24:53,178
(Touching)

2589
01:24:53,778 --> 01:24:55,148
Can I have this?

2590
01:24:55,378 --> 01:24:56,678
- Go ahead.
- Of course.

2591
01:24:56,918 --> 01:24:59,177
- What is it?
- The injeolmi snack looks good.

2592
01:24:59,178 --> 01:25:01,317
- Go ahead.
- Then I'm having cup noodles.

2593
01:25:01,318 --> 01:25:03,057
(Everyone picks one each.)

2594
01:25:03,058 --> 01:25:04,757
- Shall we?
- Instead of a snack,

2595
01:25:04,758 --> 01:25:07,587
it might be better to have cup noodles like Kyung Pyo.

2596
01:25:07,588 --> 01:25:09,087
Right. Have cup noodles.

2597
01:25:09,088 --> 01:25:10,657
This is 1.50 dollars.

2598
01:25:10,658 --> 01:25:13,027
- I'll take it.
- Cup noodles for 1.50 dollars.

2599
01:25:13,028 --> 01:25:14,898
- One cup of noodles.
- That's eight dollars.

2600
01:25:15,028 --> 01:25:16,028
No, it's six dollars.

2601
01:25:16,668 --> 01:25:18,738
- I'm taking soy milk. Done.
- Okay.

2602
01:25:19,638 --> 01:25:20,667
Soy milk.

2603
01:25:20,668 --> 01:25:21,707
(Sun Young chose soy milk instead of ramyeon.)

2604
01:25:21,708 --> 01:25:23,737
We need to check how much it is so far.

2605
01:25:23,738 --> 01:25:25,877
- Do we have 50 cents left?
- We have 50 cents left?

2606
01:25:25,878 --> 01:25:26,907
- Yes.
- Yes.

2607
01:25:26,908 --> 01:25:28,548
What can we get with 50 cents here?

2608
01:25:29,618 --> 01:25:31,717
The bubble gum for kids.

2609
01:25:31,718 --> 01:25:34,348
- The bubble gum.
- The bubble gum.

2610
01:25:34,488 --> 01:25:35,947
Let's take one for the driver.

2611
01:25:35,948 --> 01:25:37,387
- Sure. Let's do that.
- Yes.

2612
01:25:37,388 --> 01:25:39,188
We spent all 12 dollars.

2613
01:25:39,928 --> 01:25:41,227
(Including the bubble gum, they spend all 12 dollars.)

2614
01:25:41,228 --> 01:25:43,228
- You pay for it.
- Okay.

2615
01:25:44,328 --> 01:25:45,857
(Sun Woo, Taek, and Dong Ryong's receipt)

2616
01:25:45,858 --> 01:25:48,098
(Total 12 dollars)

2617
01:25:48,498 --> 01:25:49,598
It's...

2618
01:25:50,538 --> 01:25:51,898
It's kind of empty here.

2619
01:25:52,738 --> 01:25:53,937
(A humble composition on a wide table)

2620
01:25:53,938 --> 01:25:56,307
- It's empty here.
- Open this.

2621
01:25:56,308 --> 01:25:57,378
Sounds good.

2622
01:25:58,238 --> 01:25:59,677
(He opens it manly...)

2623
01:25:59,678 --> 01:26:01,548
(and places it securely.)

2624
01:26:01,708 --> 01:26:03,518
- Sun Young, try it.
- What...

2625
01:26:03,578 --> 01:26:04,977
This is ridiculous.

2626
01:26:04,978 --> 01:26:07,148
We only spent 12 dollars here.

2627
01:26:07,348 --> 01:26:09,218
- This is good. Try it.
- You eat.

2628
01:26:09,248 --> 01:26:10,287
We're not university students.

2629
01:26:10,288 --> 01:26:11,488
- Only ramyeon...
- This is my favorite.

2630
01:26:11,958 --> 01:26:14,028
- with a snack...
- This is very good.

2631
01:26:14,328 --> 01:26:16,397
(While they're looking pitiful...)

2632
01:26:16,398 --> 01:26:20,828
(by having snacks and ramyeon,)

2633
01:26:21,168 --> 01:26:24,068
(a boisterous family appears.)

2634
01:26:24,438 --> 01:26:25,598
- I'm hungry.
- So tired.

2635
01:26:25,798 --> 01:26:26,868
Are you hungry?

2636
01:26:28,238 --> 01:26:29,307
(Raising)

2637
01:26:29,308 --> 01:26:30,478
Cool.

2638
01:26:31,038 --> 01:26:33,608
The successful man's composure.

2639
01:26:34,608 --> 01:26:36,648
Why am I walking like this?

2640
01:26:37,448 --> 01:26:39,178
I'm walking like this.

2641
01:26:39,478 --> 01:26:41,617
Me too. I walk differently.

2642
01:26:41,618 --> 01:26:43,918
(This family has unique gaits.)

2643
01:26:44,558 --> 01:26:47,188
(They soon see who's arrived.)

2644
01:26:47,358 --> 01:26:48,827
Right. They're all here.

2645
01:26:48,828 --> 01:26:50,197
(Laughing)

2646
01:26:50,198 --> 01:26:51,558
(Checking)

2647
01:26:51,928 --> 01:26:53,397
Do they have money?

2648
01:26:53,398 --> 01:26:54,427
I'm the expert.

2649
01:26:54,428 --> 01:26:56,837
I think we're the richest.

2650
01:26:56,838 --> 01:26:58,068
(As always)

2651
01:26:58,268 --> 01:26:59,438
What are we having?

2652
01:26:59,968 --> 01:27:01,207
- Well...
- There's a lot to eat.

2653
01:27:01,208 --> 01:27:02,467
We can order a few.

2654
01:27:02,468 --> 01:27:03,577
The dried pollack soup is 11 dollars.

2655
01:27:03,578 --> 01:27:05,107
There are pictures.

2656
01:27:05,108 --> 01:27:06,138
(They dream of having 3 items per person.)

2657
01:27:06,208 --> 01:27:08,507
The signature item. I'll have the dried pollack soup.

2658
01:27:08,508 --> 01:27:09,647
I'll have the dried pollack soup.

2659
01:27:09,648 --> 01:27:10,678
(Ms. Cheetah chooses the dried pollack soup.)

2660
01:27:10,748 --> 01:27:13,018
Since that's the signature, I will have the dried pollack soup too.

2661
01:27:13,348 --> 01:27:14,387
Okay.

2662
01:27:14,388 --> 01:27:16,918
Then I'll also have the dried pollack soup.

2663
01:27:17,018 --> 01:27:18,257
- Bibimbap, jjajang rice...
- And...

2664
01:27:18,258 --> 01:27:19,827
- Shall we get that to share?
- Yes.

2665
01:27:19,828 --> 01:27:21,888
- For us to share.
- To share.

2666
01:27:22,628 --> 01:27:25,058
We'll get four servings of dried pollack soup.

2667
01:27:25,558 --> 01:27:27,597
One jjajangmyeon, one fishcake udon,

2668
01:27:27,598 --> 01:27:29,267
one jjajang rice, and one bibimbap.

2669
01:27:29,268 --> 01:27:30,638
(That is 2 dishes per person.)

2670
01:27:30,738 --> 01:27:31,738
Your total is 77 dollars.

2671
01:27:31,739 --> 01:27:33,168
That doesn't exceed our budget.

2672
01:27:33,538 --> 01:27:34,607
- Is it 77 dollars?
- Yes.

2673
01:27:34,608 --> 01:27:36,038
We can get coffee too.

2674
01:27:37,378 --> 01:27:38,537
We have 23 dollars left.

2675
01:27:38,538 --> 01:27:40,107
- Really?
- We have 23 dollars left?

2676
01:27:40,108 --> 01:27:41,307
(Even after getting 2 dishes per person,)

2677
01:27:41,308 --> 01:27:42,648
(they still have more money left than Sun Woo, Taek, and Dong Ryong.)

2678
01:27:43,448 --> 01:27:45,517
- This is so good.
- I can hear them.

2679
01:27:45,518 --> 01:27:48,218
- What?
- But...

2680
01:27:48,588 --> 01:27:50,488
That's Jung Bong and...

2681
01:27:51,388 --> 01:27:53,057
- What?
- What? They're here.

2682
01:27:53,058 --> 01:27:54,128
Are they here?

2683
01:27:54,758 --> 01:27:57,197
- They're here.
- Oh, it's Jung Bong.

2684
01:27:57,198 --> 01:27:58,228
They're here.

2685
01:27:58,598 --> 01:28:00,298
- Hi.
- They're wearing it.

2686
01:28:00,928 --> 01:28:02,198
Your clothes...

2687
01:28:02,468 --> 01:28:03,698
How have you been?

2688
01:28:04,298 --> 01:28:06,338
- Hi.
- Bo Gum.

2689
01:28:06,438 --> 01:28:09,037
- It's been a long time.
- I know.

2690
01:28:09,038 --> 01:28:10,907
(Hugging as much as they missed each other)

2691
01:28:10,908 --> 01:28:11,978
Have a seat.

2692
01:28:12,138 --> 01:28:13,908
I've seen you a lot on TV.

2693
01:28:14,448 --> 01:28:15,848
The mask.

2694
01:28:16,048 --> 01:28:17,647
- That was fun to watch.
- Really?

2695
01:28:17,648 --> 01:28:18,718
Oh, yes.

2696
01:28:18,778 --> 01:28:21,447
- Are you having cup noodles?
- Get us some food.

2697
01:28:21,448 --> 01:28:22,547
Get us some food.

2698
01:28:22,548 --> 01:28:24,787
- Let's share.
- Sure. Since we're rich.

2699
01:28:24,788 --> 01:28:27,187
Are they allowed to buy us food? You are.

2700
01:28:27,188 --> 01:28:29,828
You know what? That's what happened in the drama too.

2701
01:28:29,928 --> 01:28:30,928
Oh, yes.

2702
01:28:30,929 --> 01:28:32,597
- We burrowed everything from them.
- Right.

2703
01:28:32,598 --> 01:28:33,968
Only Deok Sun's family isn't here yet.

2704
01:28:34,668 --> 01:28:36,168
Oh, it's Deok Sun's family.

2705
01:28:36,398 --> 01:28:37,868
They're here.

2706
01:28:38,598 --> 01:28:40,638
- We got to meet everyone here.
- They're...

2707
01:28:41,168 --> 01:28:42,767
- What's going on?
- They didn't get changed either.

2708
01:28:42,768 --> 01:28:44,338
You look neat.

2709
01:28:45,638 --> 01:28:47,007
- Hello.
- Hi.

2710
01:28:47,008 --> 01:28:48,307
- Hi.
- What's going on?

2711
01:28:48,308 --> 01:28:49,878
You look neat.

2712
01:28:50,018 --> 01:28:51,918
- Mi Ran.
- Come here.

2713
01:28:53,848 --> 01:28:56,357
- How have you been?
- How have you been?

2714
01:28:56,358 --> 01:28:57,817
- I missed you so much.
- Me too.

2715
01:28:57,818 --> 01:28:59,217
You lost weight.

2716
01:28:59,218 --> 01:29:00,457
- What?
- You lost weight.

2717
01:29:00,458 --> 01:29:01,488
I didn't.

2718
01:29:01,888 --> 01:29:03,528
You look beautiful.

2719
01:29:04,198 --> 01:29:05,758
It's so embarrassing.

2720
01:29:06,398 --> 01:29:07,597
This is so embarrassing.

2721
01:29:07,598 --> 01:29:09,228
(You look pretty.)

2722
01:29:09,328 --> 01:29:10,737
This is so embarrassing.

2723
01:29:10,738 --> 01:29:12,668
(Laughing)

2724
01:29:14,738 --> 01:29:16,808
(Stealing the cup noodles naturally)

2725
01:29:17,208 --> 01:29:18,938
(Slurping)

2726
01:29:19,038 --> 01:29:21,978
(Eating ramyeon naturally)

2727
01:29:22,508 --> 01:29:24,018
Oh, good to see you again.

2728
01:29:24,478 --> 01:29:26,488
They just got here.

2729
01:29:27,088 --> 01:29:28,148
Hi.

2730
01:29:28,488 --> 01:29:29,617
Hi.

2731
01:29:29,618 --> 01:29:30,688
(Good to see you.)

2732
01:29:30,818 --> 01:29:33,228
(The 3 fathers still say hi.)

2733
01:29:34,028 --> 01:29:37,528
(Focusing on the ramyeon amidst the crowd)

2734
01:29:39,628 --> 01:29:42,327
(His daughter on the other side also slurps ramyeon.)

2735
01:29:42,328 --> 01:29:44,868
(Like father, like daughter.)

2736
01:29:46,138 --> 01:29:48,168
We all met in the end.

2737
01:29:48,838 --> 01:29:49,878
Director Shin.

2738
01:29:50,238 --> 01:29:52,978
I'm asking you again because everyone is here.

2739
01:29:53,148 --> 01:29:54,708
Where is my mother?

2740
01:29:54,848 --> 01:29:56,877
- Oh, I heard.
- Because of me...

2741
01:29:56,878 --> 01:29:58,017
(Ssangmun-dong hasn't changed even after 10 years.)

2742
01:29:58,018 --> 01:30:00,518
- It feels like a holiday.
- I know.

2743
01:30:01,548 --> 01:30:03,357
(Between a holiday and a picnic,)

2744
01:30:03,358 --> 01:30:05,018
(their exciting fall outing begins.)

2745
01:30:06,116 --> 01:30:07,969
(Next week)

2746
01:30:08,139 --> 01:30:11,309
(They catch up on each other after 10 years.)

2747
01:30:11,439 --> 01:30:13,008
Did you lose weight for filming?

2748
01:30:13,009 --> 01:30:14,279
You became so handsome.

2749
01:30:14,679 --> 01:30:19,678
(Let's catch up...)

2750
01:30:19,679 --> 01:30:22,019
(and eat.)

2751
01:30:22,279 --> 01:30:24,449
Everyone, I can't just give it to you.

2752
01:30:24,619 --> 01:30:26,319
You need to show us something.

2753
01:30:26,389 --> 01:30:29,519
(Oh, right. Jung Bong's family is our financier.)

2754
01:30:29,719 --> 01:30:31,088
Oh, is that jjajang?

2755
01:30:31,089 --> 01:30:32,189
(Will you give us some?)

2756
01:30:32,759 --> 01:30:34,159
Will you pass me the chopsticks?

2757
01:30:34,759 --> 01:30:36,799
(Moving quickly)

2758
01:30:37,329 --> 01:30:41,869
(Ssangmun-dong residents rely on rich Jung Bong's family.)

2759
01:30:43,409 --> 01:30:44,768
Did you win a gold medal?

2760
01:30:44,769 --> 01:30:45,969
(Shy)

2761
01:30:46,139 --> 01:30:47,338
You should be careful in Gangwon Province.

2762
01:30:47,339 --> 01:30:48,538
It's the hunting season.

2763
01:30:48,539 --> 01:30:49,639
(Bitter)

2764
01:30:49,779 --> 01:30:52,849

(Back to "Reply 1988" as soon as they meet)

2766
01:30:55,949 --> 01:30:59,119
(Let's head to Goseong with the "Reply 1988" vibe.)

(Tchaikovsky)

2770
01:31:06,459 --> 01:31:08,059
The byword for probiotics.

2771
01:31:08,829 --> 01:31:11,229
(What does he have to do with probiotics?)

2772
01:31:12,069 --> 01:31:13,739
(Beef cutlet)

2773
01:31:14,369 --> 01:31:15,699
(I don't know.)

2774
01:31:15,739 --> 01:31:17,138
(This is crazy.)

2775
01:31:17,139 --> 01:31:18,939
(Just say pass, you wench!)

2776
01:31:19,139 --> 01:31:21,178

01:31:26,479 --> 01:31:28,019
(He's up already. You can't change him.)

2780
01:31:28,119 --> 01:31:29,679
(I know.)

2781
01:31:29,779 --> 01:31:31,289
(Hey, you idiot.)

2782
01:31:32,519 --> 01:31:36,689
(They may quarrel, but they're still close.)

2783
01:31:37,429 --> 01:31:40,499
(Their crazy family retreat is coming soon.)

2784
01:31:40,529 --> 01:31:41,858
(And...)

2785
01:31:41,859 --> 01:31:43,699
(If it hadn't been for "Reply 1988...")

2786
01:31:45,969 --> 01:31:48,399
(The touching story that wasn't told anywhere else)

2787

It really is an unforgettable drama.

01:31:51,639 --> 01:31:52,808
"Reply..."

2790
01:31:52,809 --> 01:31:54,008
- "1988," - "1988,"

2791
01:31:54,009 --> 01:31:55,808
- let's go!
- let's go!

2792
