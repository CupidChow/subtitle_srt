1
00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:27,425
(The Ssangmun-dong family gathered one at a time.)

2
00:00:27,426 --> 00:00:28,755
(Deok Sun's family)

3
00:00:28,756 --> 00:00:31,125
(At different places,)

4
00:00:31,126 --> 00:00:35,495
(they said hello with the same appearances.)

5
00:00:35,496 --> 00:00:37,265
(What awaited them...)

6
00:00:37,266 --> 00:00:39,406
(was a separate game for allowance.)

7
00:00:39,536 --> 00:00:41,035
(Success meant 20 dollars per person.)

8
00:00:41,036 --> 00:00:43,406
(Failure meant 2 dollars per person.)

9
00:00:43,536 --> 00:00:44,645
Two, three.

10
00:00:44,646 --> 00:00:47,276
(Sun Woo, Taek, and Dong Ryong's family couldn't speak.)

11
00:00:48,076 --> 00:00:51,585
(Deok Sun's family spoke too freely.)

12
00:00:51,586 --> 00:00:53,085
(The two families failed.)

13
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:54,586
(Each person got 2 dollars as an allowance.)

14
00:00:55,286 --> 00:00:58,156
(Meanwhile, Jung Bong's family did pretty well.)

15
00:00:58,356 --> 00:01:00,726
(The ace of Guess Who Quiz wrapped up calmly...)

16
00:01:00,926 --> 00:01:02,625
(and Jung Bong's family succeeded in the game!)

17
00:01:02,626 --> 00:01:04,566
(Each person got 20 dollars as an allowance.)

18
00:01:04,966 --> 00:01:07,566
(After the game, the three families went to the rest stop.)

19
00:01:07,796 --> 00:01:13,065
(The family that failed the game got food at a convenience store.)

20
00:01:13,066 --> 00:01:14,575
(The rich family that succeeded in the game)

21
00:01:14,576 --> 00:01:16,005
(4 pollack soups, 1 jjajangmyeon, 1 fishcake udon,)

22
00:01:16,006 --> 00:01:17,275
(1 jjajang rice, and 1 bibimbap)

23
00:01:17,276 --> 00:01:18,706
(They ordered so much food.)

24
00:01:18,846 --> 00:01:19,945
It's 77 dollars.

25
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:21,216
It didn't go over the limit.

26
00:01:21,716 --> 00:01:24,045
(They still had some money left.)

27
00:01:24,046 --> 00:01:25,116
(What?)

28
00:01:25,246 --> 00:01:26,645
What? It's Deok Sun's family!

29
00:01:26,646 --> 00:01:27,956
(What? It's Deok Sun's family!)

30
00:01:28,286 --> 00:01:31,016
(Deok Sun's family arrived last.)

31
00:01:31,756 --> 00:01:37,026
(The Ssangmun-dong family finally gathered in one place.)

32
00:01:37,896 --> 00:01:40,025
(They say hello to each other after 10 years.)

33
00:01:40,026 --> 00:01:42,136
(We filmed with the permission of the rest stop.)

34
00:01:42,196 --> 00:01:43,295
Sit here.

35
00:01:43,296 --> 00:01:44,835
In the end, all of us met.

36
00:01:44,836 --> 00:01:46,006
Sit here.

37
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:49,476
(After the greetings, the members sit down.)

38
00:01:50,206 --> 00:01:51,546
Can everyone sit down?

39
00:01:52,006 --> 00:01:53,176
Everyone sat down.

40
00:01:53,946 --> 00:01:54,975
(Five families sit together.)

41
00:01:54,976 --> 00:01:56,076
Did you cry?

42
00:01:56,546 --> 00:01:57,575
(Sun Woo, Taek, and Dong Ryong's family)

43
00:01:57,576 --> 00:01:58,585
(Jung Bong's family)

44
00:01:58,586 --> 00:02:00,145
(Deok Sun's family)

45
00:02:00,146 --> 00:02:01,256
Enjoy the food.

46
00:02:02,116 --> 00:02:04,585
You had to see a celebrity's face and guess his or her name, right?

47
00:02:04,586 --> 00:02:06,425
- We played the Initial Quiz.
-  Initial Quiz?

48
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:07,555
We played different games.

49
00:02:07,556 --> 00:02:08,725
- That sounds hard too.
-  We had the Guess Who Quiz.

50
00:02:08,726 --> 00:02:09,796
Which game did you play?

51
00:02:09,926 --> 00:02:11,625
- Reverse Perfect Pitch.
-  Reverse Perfect Pitch.

52
00:02:11,626 --> 00:02:13,525
- You change where you stress.
-  Yes.

53
00:02:13,526 --> 00:02:14,665
- That's a difficult game.
-  It's very difficult.

54
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:15,765
Were the games different?

55
00:02:15,766 --> 00:02:17,435
We had the Guess Who Quiz.

56
00:02:17,436 --> 00:02:18,805
- The games were different.
-  We guessed names from photos.

57
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:21,175
I should've played the Guess Who Quiz.

58
00:02:21,176 --> 00:02:22,275
Gosh.

59
00:02:22,276 --> 00:02:23,476
Did you win ten dollars?

60
00:02:23,536 --> 00:02:24,645
This is all we have.

61
00:02:24,646 --> 00:02:26,605
- We only have ten dollars.
-  We made predictions.

62
00:02:26,606 --> 00:02:28,875
This family will fail because of Dong Il.

63
00:02:28,876 --> 00:02:30,876
That family will fail because of Moo Sung.

64
00:02:32,216 --> 00:02:33,286
As for my team,

65
00:02:33,346 --> 00:02:34,416
it's over.

66
00:02:35,286 --> 00:02:36,616
It's over because of me.

67
00:02:36,816 --> 00:02:38,555
(He understands himself perfectly.)

68
00:02:38,556 --> 00:02:40,126
Did you fail?

69
00:02:40,656 --> 00:02:42,126
We succeeded in it,

70
00:02:42,156 --> 00:02:43,255
but Dad went,

71
00:02:43,256 --> 00:02:44,965
"Double the money!"

72
00:02:44,966 --> 00:02:45,996
Then we failed.

73
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:47,495
Why did you up the stakes?

74
00:02:47,496 --> 00:02:48,636
To 200 dollars?

75
00:02:49,566 --> 00:02:50,936
We upped the stakes and failed.

76
00:02:51,406 --> 00:02:53,636
(They tried to double the prize and failed.)

77
00:02:54,136 --> 00:02:56,506
Again, Dad stood surety.

78
00:02:57,636 --> 00:03:00,275
(Life is all about a big break.)

79
00:03:00,276 --> 00:03:01,976
Reverse Perfect Pitch.

80
00:03:02,446 --> 00:03:03,816
- You know, - It was fun.

81
00:03:04,016 --> 00:03:06,546
- it feels like a holiday.
-  I know.

82
00:03:07,016 --> 00:03:10,656
(It feels like a holiday meal after a round of Go-stop.)

83
00:03:10,886 --> 00:03:12,086
Our food is here.

84
00:03:12,126 --> 00:03:13,755
- Our food is here.
-  Our food is here.

85
00:03:13,756 --> 00:03:15,055
What's this?

86
00:03:15,056 --> 00:03:16,855
- I want to eat too.
-  Our food is here.

87
00:03:16,856 --> 00:03:18,325
We ordered a lot of food.

88
00:03:18,326 --> 00:03:20,525
We ordered two dishes per person.

89
00:03:20,526 --> 00:03:21,635
Don't you have money?

90
00:03:21,636 --> 00:03:23,195
We have a lot of food.

91
00:03:23,196 --> 00:03:24,606
(Why is he standing up?)

92
00:03:24,636 --> 00:03:25,965
- Is that jjajangmyeon?
-  Be careful.

93
00:03:25,966 --> 00:03:27,166
- Be careful.
-  That's incredible.

94
00:03:27,836 --> 00:03:29,375
- We won.
-  We'll have leftovers.

95
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:30,576
(The food looks delicious.)

96
00:03:30,806 --> 00:03:32,276
Gosh, it's pollack soup.

97
00:03:32,906 --> 00:03:34,615
Pollack soup is their signature dish.

98
00:03:34,616 --> 00:03:35,946
- Pollack soup?
-  Yes.

99
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:39,086
(Introducing the food of Jung Bong's family)

100
00:03:39,516 --> 00:03:41,556
(A popular dish at the rest stop, pollack soup)

101
00:03:42,116 --> 00:03:45,386
(It has the milky white broth and plump pollack pieces.)

102
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:47,726
(Plump)

103
00:03:48,356 --> 00:03:51,026
(The second popular dish, jjajangmyeon...)

104
00:03:51,866 --> 00:03:54,096
(and 3 other tasty dishes are here as well.)

105
00:03:54,426 --> 00:03:56,336
- Be careful.
-  Would you give me some chopsticks?

106
00:03:56,796 --> 00:03:58,605
(Moving at once)

107
00:03:58,606 --> 00:04:01,006
(They move quickly in order to get a bite.)

108
00:04:01,036 --> 00:04:02,335
(Jung Bong's family gets ready to eat.)

109
00:04:02,336 --> 00:04:03,375
Let's scoop some out.

110
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:04,505
Dong Il, will you eat?

111
00:04:04,506 --> 00:04:05,905
- Why would you scoop it out?
-  No.

112
00:04:05,906 --> 00:04:07,005
I won't eat.

113
00:04:07,006 --> 00:04:08,815
We'll eat two dishes per person.

114
00:04:08,816 --> 00:04:09,916
Really?

115
00:04:10,576 --> 00:04:11,815
Hold on. Who are the family members?

116
00:04:11,816 --> 00:04:13,715
- Are these the family members?
-  That's right.

117
00:04:13,716 --> 00:04:15,215
- The daughter-in-law too.
-  The daughter-in-law too.

118
00:04:15,216 --> 00:04:16,655
- The daughter-in-law.
-  The daughter-in-law too.

119
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:17,815
The daughter-in-law too?

120
00:04:17,816 --> 00:04:19,126
(The daughter-in-law is included in the family.)

121
00:04:19,226 --> 00:04:21,356
Shall we give them...

122
00:04:21,456 --> 00:04:22,926
the pollack soup?

123
00:04:22,956 --> 00:04:24,765
Of course not. We'll eat by ourselves.

124
00:04:24,766 --> 00:04:25,895
Don't you know how to play a game?

125
00:04:25,896 --> 00:04:27,026
(Don't be like that.)

126
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:29,135
- Why are you holding chopsticks?
-  This table is too crowded.

127
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:30,866
Let's move things to that table.

128
00:04:31,706 --> 00:04:33,135
Let's put rice in one soup...

129
00:04:33,136 --> 00:04:35,005
- and share.
-  Half and half.

130
00:04:35,006 --> 00:04:36,876
Don't think about sharing. Rules are rules.

131
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:38,776
Rules are rules.

132
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:41,546
Even if our stomachs burst, we'll eat all the food.

133
00:04:41,846 --> 00:04:44,116
Honey, shall we distribute food?

134
00:04:45,446 --> 00:04:46,815
Shall we do that?

135
00:04:46,816 --> 00:04:47,845
(Everyone's meal depends on Ms. Cheetah.)

136
00:04:47,846 --> 00:04:48,916
Give it over there.

137
00:04:49,086 --> 00:04:50,455
(Ms. Cheetah allows the food distribution.)

138
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:51,526
Will they share food?

139
00:04:51,956 --> 00:04:54,026
(They're graced with food.)

140
00:04:54,056 --> 00:04:55,125
It's so funny...

141
00:04:55,126 --> 00:04:57,156
because this is exactly what happened on "Reply 1988."

142
00:04:57,556 --> 00:04:59,395
Here are the bowls.

143
00:04:59,396 --> 00:05:00,995
Use them to share food.

144
00:05:00,996 --> 00:05:02,635
Thank you.

145
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,705
- Bo Gum, take this.
-  Okay.

146
00:05:04,706 --> 00:05:06,036
Let's share.

147
00:05:06,266 --> 00:05:07,506
Let's put rice in it.

148
00:05:08,636 --> 00:05:09,935
- Bo Gum.
-  Yes?

149
00:05:09,936 --> 00:05:11,235
- Take this.
-  All right.

150
00:05:11,236 --> 00:05:12,375
Thank you.

151
00:05:12,376 --> 00:05:13,806
(Jung Bong's family is so generous.)

152
00:05:14,476 --> 00:05:16,145
(The distribution continues for a while.)

153
00:05:16,146 --> 00:05:17,146
Thank you.

154
00:05:17,147 --> 00:05:18,445
- Jung Bong, mix it well.
-  The thing is,

155
00:05:18,446 --> 00:05:19,646
- I was acting up, so...
-  Mix it well.

156
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:21,216
My goodness.

157
00:05:21,386 --> 00:05:24,185
- One family should be rich.
-  After ten years,

158
00:05:24,186 --> 00:05:25,385
I'm mixing bibimbap.

159
00:05:25,386 --> 00:05:26,926
Gosh, Jung Bong...

160
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:29,296
Jung Bong is mixing bibimbap.

161
00:05:29,456 --> 00:05:30,495
Bibimbap.

162
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:33,426
(The same skills he used to mix bibimbap on the drama)

163
00:05:33,896 --> 00:05:34,896
Shall I try it?

164
00:05:34,897 --> 00:05:36,095
- May I try it?
-  Go ahead.

165
00:05:36,096 --> 00:05:37,236
Thank you.

166
00:05:38,066 --> 00:05:39,405
Thank you for the food.

167
00:05:39,406 --> 00:05:40,636
(Thank you for the food.)

168
00:05:40,836 --> 00:05:42,306
Who doesn't have spoons and chopsticks?

169
00:05:42,636 --> 00:05:44,176
Who doesn't have spoons and chopsticks?

170
00:05:44,576 --> 00:05:45,706
- You don't have them.
-  Thank you for the food.

171
00:05:46,006 --> 00:05:47,176
- Do you have them?
-  Yes.

172
00:05:47,776 --> 00:05:49,146
Dong Il, here.

173
00:05:50,346 --> 00:05:51,346
Here.

174
00:05:51,347 --> 00:05:52,386
(Il Hwa takes care of her husband first.)

175
00:05:52,746 --> 00:05:54,955
(Dad eats jjajangmyeon first.)

176
00:05:54,956 --> 00:05:57,486
(It's tastier because it's from his wife.)

177
00:05:58,656 --> 00:05:59,925
(The daughter eats rice instead of noodles.)

178
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:00,985
How about you?

179
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:02,326
- I have food.
-  Okay.

180
00:06:02,356 --> 00:06:04,866
(The taste makes her clap.)

181
00:06:05,496 --> 00:06:06,895
(Bo Ra enjoys Jung Bong's bibimbap.)

182
00:06:06,896 --> 00:06:08,365
Let's use this spoon to scoop out food.

183
00:06:08,366 --> 00:06:09,395
(Furrowing her brows)

184
00:06:09,396 --> 00:06:10,536
(Clenching her fists)

185
00:06:10,866 --> 00:06:11,866
That's right.

186
00:06:11,867 --> 00:06:13,605
(Mom finally takes a spoonful.)

187
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:14,636
It's so tasty.

188
00:06:14,736 --> 00:06:17,006
Try it. It's so tasty.

189
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:18,246
It's so tasty.

190
00:06:18,306 --> 00:06:20,706
What's this? It looks like that thing.

191
00:06:21,576 --> 00:06:22,576
It's...

192
00:06:22,577 --> 00:06:24,446
- seasoned pollack.
-  I see. Pollack.

193
00:06:25,046 --> 00:06:26,186
It's nice.

194
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:30,385
(Bo Gun trusts Sun Young and takes a bite.)

195
00:06:30,386 --> 00:06:32,026
- It's tasty.
-  It's tasty.

196
00:06:32,956 --> 00:06:34,626
(Eating)

197
00:06:34,796 --> 00:06:37,126
(Bo Gum's appetite gets stimulated.)

198
00:06:37,426 --> 00:06:39,825
(Slurping)

199
00:06:39,826 --> 00:06:43,036
(He drinks from the bowl.)

200
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,266
See? You were hungry.

201
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,706
Bo Gum is always like that.

202
00:06:49,436 --> 00:06:50,936
This place...

203
00:06:51,076 --> 00:06:52,576
makes tasty food.

204
00:06:53,406 --> 00:06:54,475
That's right.

205
00:06:54,476 --> 00:06:55,646
(I agree.)

206
00:06:55,676 --> 00:06:57,276
When you're with other people,

207
00:06:57,616 --> 00:06:58,816
you want to eat more.

208
00:06:59,816 --> 00:07:01,586
- Dong Il, try this.
-  I'm eating it.

209
00:07:01,886 --> 00:07:03,115
I can't believe this is a side dish.

210
00:07:03,116 --> 00:07:04,585
- It's so tasty.
-  It's so tasty.

211
00:07:04,586 --> 00:07:05,825
(Food tastes better...)

212
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:07,056
(since they're eating together after 10 years.)

213
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:10,426
We had many scenes in which we ate together.

214
00:07:10,526 --> 00:07:11,526
That's right.

215
00:07:11,566 --> 00:07:12,795
Remember?

216
00:07:12,796 --> 00:07:14,195
(Memories from 10 years ago come back...)

217
00:07:14,196 --> 00:07:15,536
(now that they're together.)

218
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:22,706
(The drama had many scenes in which they ate together.)

219
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:29,946
(Adults had a drink to take their edges off.)

220
00:07:31,246 --> 00:07:36,956
(Children gathered in the room after school.)

221
00:07:38,016 --> 00:07:43,296
(Ramyeon was a popular menu.)

222
00:07:44,556 --> 00:07:46,996
(Sometimes, fusion ramyeon appeared.)

223
00:07:47,796 --> 00:07:51,966
(They shared affection through food in Ssangmun-dong back in the day.)

224
00:07:52,636 --> 00:07:53,806
It's tasty.

225
00:07:55,736 --> 00:07:56,876
Thanks.

226
00:07:57,506 --> 00:07:58,646
It's like a holiday.

227
00:07:58,746 --> 00:08:00,006
It really feels like a holiday.

228
00:08:00,276 --> 00:08:01,916
Who drove for Mi Ran's family?

229
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:03,476
- The oldest son.
-  I did.

230
00:08:04,576 --> 00:08:06,946
The sons drove. My son drove as well.

231
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:08,585
Who drove for that family?

232
00:08:08,586 --> 00:08:10,016
(Dong Hwi)

233
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:11,156
We had Grandeur.

234
00:08:11,286 --> 00:08:13,155
Really? The old model?

235
00:08:13,156 --> 00:08:14,356
- Hold on.
-  No.

236
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:16,195
How many cars are there?

237
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:17,456
(Why is she so serious?)

238
00:08:17,496 --> 00:08:18,795
- Three, right?
-  Three, right?

239
00:08:18,796 --> 00:08:20,925
Then who else drove?

240
00:08:20,926 --> 00:08:22,295
- I see. Did you drive?
-  Yes.

241
00:08:22,296 --> 00:08:23,696
Who drove for that family?

242
00:08:23,766 --> 00:08:24,905
I did.

243
00:08:24,906 --> 00:08:26,205
- You?
-  Yes.

244
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:27,206
- You?
-  For information,

245
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:29,136
they need to ask the same question four times.

246
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:32,376
Who drove for that family?

247
00:08:33,906 --> 00:08:35,016
Listen.

248
00:08:35,946 --> 00:08:37,576
Write it on your chest.

249
00:08:38,076 --> 00:08:39,915
Write it on your chest if you drove.

250
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:41,286
(Dong Ryong's dad has a sense of humor.)

251
00:08:41,886 --> 00:08:44,085
(They marvel at the teacher's wits.)

252
00:08:44,086 --> 00:08:45,756
You should ask once more.

253
00:08:46,056 --> 00:08:47,755
What great timing.

254
00:08:47,756 --> 00:08:50,555
- Seriously. What great timing.
-  Who drove for that family?

255
00:08:50,556 --> 00:08:53,926
(So, who was the driver?)

256
00:08:54,996 --> 00:08:56,636
Did you lose weight for a role?

257
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:58,096
- Yes, I lost weight.
-  My goodness.

258
00:08:58,136 --> 00:08:59,336
Why did you become so handsome?

259
00:08:59,866 --> 00:09:02,076
- You seem unapproachable, Jae Hong.
-  You seem unfamiliar.

260
00:09:02,106 --> 00:09:03,135
He's perfect.

261
00:09:03,136 --> 00:09:04,275
- You seem unfamiliar.
-  He's handsome.

262
00:09:04,276 --> 00:09:05,446
(Mom is proud.)

263
00:09:06,006 --> 00:09:07,906
(Embarrassed)

264
00:09:08,246 --> 00:09:10,316
What? Mi Ran.

265
00:09:12,616 --> 00:09:13,886
Why do you look so pretty today?

266
00:09:14,546 --> 00:09:16,686
(After the son, it's the mom's turn to receive compliments.)

267
00:09:16,816 --> 00:09:18,085
You're a retro beauty.

268
00:09:18,086 --> 00:09:19,186
Do I look pretty?

269
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:22,456
I was so embarrassed that I didn't want to come out.

270
00:09:23,526 --> 00:09:25,766
This is the prettiest I've seen you.

271
00:09:26,426 --> 00:09:28,595
You've become very pretty.

272
00:09:28,596 --> 00:09:30,195
I wore this outfit to be funny.

273
00:09:30,196 --> 00:09:31,935
- No, you don't look funny at all.
-  You look pretty.

274
00:09:31,936 --> 00:09:33,205
- You look pretty.
-  Yes.

275
00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:34,665
You don't look funny at all.

276
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:36,336
- You look beautiful.
-  My plan failed.

277
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:38,175
- Your plan failed.
-  Exactly.

278
00:09:38,176 --> 00:09:39,876
- You look very pretty.
-  I wanted to make people laugh.

279
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:42,776
(Although she complains, smile spreads on her face.)

280
00:09:43,076 --> 00:09:44,076
(Chuckling)

281
00:09:44,077 --> 00:09:47,246
Look at her belt. Mi Ran, show everyone your belt.

282
00:09:48,146 --> 00:09:50,386
Look at her belt. It's ridiculous.

283
00:09:52,956 --> 00:09:54,286
You won a gold medal.

284
00:09:55,226 --> 00:09:56,696
(She has two medals.)

285
00:09:56,726 --> 00:09:57,825
They're on her belly.

286
00:09:57,826 --> 00:10:00,025
- Look at how skinny she is.
-  It's a retro style.

287
00:10:00,026 --> 00:10:03,066
- Her waist is so small.
-  Are you a champion?

288
00:10:03,396 --> 00:10:05,565
She should be careful in Gangwon Province...

289
00:10:05,566 --> 00:10:07,106
since it's the hunting season.

290
00:10:08,576 --> 00:10:09,976
It's the hunting season.

291
00:10:11,176 --> 00:10:13,446
(Be careful not to catch a cheetah.)

292
00:10:13,906 --> 00:10:16,376
Hunters might mistake her for a wild animal...

293
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:17,945
and shoot her.

294
00:10:17,946 --> 00:10:21,145
I have a fur coat too.

295
00:10:21,146 --> 00:10:23,186
- She has a fur coat too.
-  I wore a fur coat...

296
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:24,615
and sunglasses.

297
00:10:24,616 --> 00:10:26,425
She'll be a target today.

298
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:27,956
(Thank goodness they're going to the sea, not the mountains.)

299
00:10:28,456 --> 00:10:30,826
(They have a good laugh.)

300
00:10:30,996 --> 00:10:32,695
- We ate so much. Let's go.
-  Let's hurry up and go.

301
00:10:32,696 --> 00:10:34,226
Let's go.

302
00:10:34,966 --> 00:10:36,965
- Let's hurry up and go.
-  You lost so much weight.

303
00:10:36,966 --> 00:10:38,296
(The happy mealtime ends.)

304
00:10:38,766 --> 00:10:40,935
- Thank you for the food.
-  Thank you for the food.

305
00:10:40,936 --> 00:10:42,375
- Thank you for the food.
-  Thank you for the food.

306
00:10:42,376 --> 00:10:44,036
(Thanks to Jung Bong's family, everyone ate well.)

307
00:10:44,136 --> 00:10:45,876
We work so fast.

308
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:50,616
(The noisy cleanup is reminiscent of Ssangmun-dong.)

309
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,515
- Shall we get some coffee?
-  Coffee.

310
00:10:52,516 --> 00:10:54,015
- Shall we buy some coffee?
-  Shall we buy some coffee?

311
00:10:54,016 --> 00:10:55,816
Mi Ran, I have something to say.

312
00:10:56,386 --> 00:10:58,826
- Come here.
-  Dong Il, you have ten dollars.

313
00:10:59,786 --> 00:11:01,626
Who's the accountant in the team?

314
00:11:01,856 --> 00:11:03,525
- The accountant?
-  I'm holding on to the money.

315
00:11:03,526 --> 00:11:04,795
- Really?
-  No.

316
00:11:04,796 --> 00:11:05,866
No.

317
00:11:05,996 --> 00:11:06,996
Hey, Mi Ran.

318
00:11:06,997 --> 00:11:08,065
(Mi Ran apprehends Dong Il because her husband is clueless.)

319
00:11:08,066 --> 00:11:10,365
For goodness' sake. Will you make me look small?

320
00:11:10,366 --> 00:11:11,936
- Go away.
-  Mi Ran.

321
00:11:12,066 --> 00:11:14,135
- Honey.
-  Will you make me look small?

322
00:11:14,136 --> 00:11:15,336
(Feeling scared, he calls for his wife.)

323
00:11:15,706 --> 00:11:17,035
- Sung Kyun, come here.
-  Hold on to the money.

324
00:11:17,036 --> 00:11:18,746
- Give it to our daughter-in-law.
-  Sung Kyun, come here.

325
00:11:18,876 --> 00:11:20,105
Sung Kyun, come here.

326
00:11:20,106 --> 00:11:21,846
Hey, don't make me look small.

327
00:11:23,076 --> 00:11:26,016
(The husband and daughter-in-law follow with bated breath.)

328
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:28,815
- By the way, sir, - Yes?

329
00:11:28,816 --> 00:11:30,586
are there no ripe persimmons yet?

330
00:11:31,056 --> 00:11:32,155
The seedless ripe persimmons.

331
00:11:32,156 --> 00:11:33,485
We don't sell them here.

332
00:11:33,486 --> 00:11:35,426
I see. You don't sell them here.

333
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:37,456
(Before arriving at the rest stop, inside Jung Bong's family's car)

334
00:11:37,556 --> 00:11:38,826
The seedless ripe persimmons.

335
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:41,226
Let's buy some seedless ripe persimmons.

336
00:11:42,096 --> 00:11:43,366
- Shall we do that?
-  Yes.

337
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:45,835
- We can eat them together.
-  That sounds good.

338
00:11:45,836 --> 00:11:47,566
We'll have a lot of money left.

339
00:11:48,266 --> 00:11:49,935
(Mi Ran has a plan,)

340
00:11:49,936 --> 00:11:52,206
(but an unwanted guest barges in.)

341
00:11:52,676 --> 00:11:54,575
- Let's hurry. Sung Kyun, hurry up.
-  Where are we going?

342
00:11:54,576 --> 00:11:56,715
Dong Il will steal our money. Hurry up.

343
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:57,946
- Okay.
-  It isn't like that. Hey.

344
00:11:58,376 --> 00:12:00,285
- Get in the car.
-  You have over 20 dollars left.

345
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:02,056
- Combine it with our ten dollars.
-  Hurry up and get in the car.

346
00:12:02,186 --> 00:12:03,186
We'll buy seedless ripe persimmons...

347
00:12:03,187 --> 00:12:04,916
- with that money.
-  Don't make me look bad.

348
00:12:06,086 --> 00:12:08,496
You guys have 23 dollars left, and we have 10 dollars left.

349
00:12:09,026 --> 00:12:10,555
Let's buy seedless ripe persimmons...

350
00:12:10,556 --> 00:12:12,095
- They sound delicious.
-  on our way there.

351
00:12:12,096 --> 00:12:13,625
The total is 32 dollars.

352
00:12:13,626 --> 00:12:15,635
- They sound delicious.
-  We don't know how much they are.

353
00:12:15,636 --> 00:12:17,535
Let's buy them and share.

354
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:19,235
That's right. There won't be enough for everyone.

355
00:12:19,236 --> 00:12:20,806
So these two families should eat.

356
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:22,436
I think we'll be able to buy them.

357
00:12:22,906 --> 00:12:24,775
- Really?
-  There'll be one per person.

358
00:12:24,776 --> 00:12:26,845
There'll be one for each member of your family and my family,

359
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:27,905
but not other families.

360
00:12:27,906 --> 00:12:29,815
If it doesn't work out like that,

361
00:12:29,816 --> 00:12:31,475
- So...
-  we won't buy them.

362
00:12:31,476 --> 00:12:33,386
we'll follow your car.

363
00:12:34,016 --> 00:12:36,156
- We'll do that.
-  You're so meticulous.

364
00:12:36,286 --> 00:12:37,315
He wants to ride on our coattails.

365
00:12:37,316 --> 00:12:38,316
Seriously.

366
00:12:38,317 --> 00:12:40,225
Here. Trust us. Here.

367
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:41,795
- Don't take it.
-  Let's go.

368
00:12:41,796 --> 00:12:42,956
You punk, come here.

369
00:12:43,656 --> 00:12:45,865
We'll follow quietly.

370
00:12:45,866 --> 00:12:48,636
- You even got food from them.
-  Don't tell the others.

371
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:50,395
- Let's go.
-  Let's go.

372
00:12:50,396 --> 00:12:52,305
- Do you need to use the restroom?
-  You don't want them to follow.

373
00:12:52,306 --> 00:12:53,306
Okay. Let's go.

374
00:12:53,736 --> 00:12:55,875
(Deok Sun and Jung Bong's families team up...)

375
00:12:55,876 --> 00:12:58,336
(and get on the same boat.)

376
00:12:59,076 --> 00:13:01,376
- We'll follow your car.
-  Okay.

377
00:13:01,506 --> 00:13:03,146
Don't leave without us. Go slowly.

378
00:13:04,446 --> 00:13:05,686
What will you do?

379
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:07,845
We have a plan.

380
00:13:07,846 --> 00:13:09,515
- We have a plan.
-  Suit yourself.

381
00:13:09,516 --> 00:13:11,786
(While the adults come up with a plan)

382
00:13:13,256 --> 00:13:15,025
All right. Thank you.

383
00:13:15,026 --> 00:13:16,125
- This looks good.
-  It came out well.

384
00:13:16,126 --> 00:13:17,995
- The last one.
-  Only I might be in the frame.

385
00:13:17,996 --> 00:13:19,166
- Nice.
-  Seriously.

386
00:13:19,396 --> 00:13:21,296
- Let's get in the car.
-  Okay.

387
00:13:22,236 --> 00:13:24,036
Hey, who will drive?

388
00:13:24,466 --> 00:13:25,665
The eldest son, Jung Bong.

389
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:27,206
- Jung Bong.
-  Jung Bong.

390
00:13:27,936 --> 00:13:29,505
Drive slowly. We'll follow you.

391
00:13:29,506 --> 00:13:31,236
- Of course. We...
-  Okay.

392
00:13:31,676 --> 00:13:33,875
need to stop to buy seedless ripe persimmons.

393
00:13:33,876 --> 00:13:35,575
Okay. Drive slowly.

394
00:13:35,576 --> 00:13:37,116
- Let's go.
-  So,

395
00:13:37,446 --> 00:13:38,545
do we need to lose the others?

396
00:13:38,546 --> 00:13:40,245
- Yes, it's something like that.
-  Really?

397
00:13:40,246 --> 00:13:41,316
Okay.

398
00:13:41,646 --> 00:13:43,856
(They secretly form the Ripe Persimmon Fellowship.)

399
00:13:44,116 --> 00:13:45,955
I got it from Dong Il.

400
00:13:45,956 --> 00:13:47,156
- I got ten dollars.
-  Really?

401
00:13:47,886 --> 00:13:48,925
(It isn't much.)

402
00:13:48,926 --> 00:13:51,125
He only gave ten dollars.

403
00:13:51,126 --> 00:13:52,726
(Laughing)

404
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:55,895
We combined our money and Jung Bong's family's money...

405
00:13:55,896 --> 00:13:57,235
to buy ripe persimmons on our way.

406
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:59,236
- Yes!
-  Yes!

407
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:01,535
- Ripe persimmons!
-  Follow Jung Bong's family's car.

408
00:14:01,536 --> 00:14:03,906
- The black one?
-  Let's go after everyone leaves.

409
00:14:04,606 --> 00:14:06,876
- Dad is thorough.
-  He's thorough.

410
00:14:07,506 --> 00:14:08,645
Did Deok Sun's family leave?

411
00:14:08,646 --> 00:14:10,916
- They'll follow us.
-  They'll follow us? Okay.

412
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:12,216
- Let's go.
-  For ripe persimmons.

413
00:14:12,946 --> 00:14:14,686
- To eat ripe persimmons?
-  Yes.

414
00:14:14,886 --> 00:14:16,256
It's just like "Reply 1988."

415
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:18,625
- It's so similar.
-  Yes. Deok Sun's family.

416
00:14:18,626 --> 00:14:20,086
- Is it the white car behind us?
-  It's that one.

417
00:14:20,856 --> 00:14:21,925
- That one?
-  Yes.

418
00:14:21,926 --> 00:14:24,226
They're leaving at the same time as us.

419
00:14:24,726 --> 00:14:27,026
Put our car behind Jung Bong's family's car.

420
00:14:27,296 --> 00:14:28,395
Okay.

421
00:14:28,396 --> 00:14:30,666
(Ripe Persimmon Fellowship sets off.)

422
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:34,706
(It takes about 1 hour to reach the lodging.)

423
00:14:35,006 --> 00:14:37,535
I felt so lost when we only had ten dollars.

424
00:14:37,536 --> 00:14:38,976
Seriously. I can't believe it worked.

425
00:14:39,146 --> 00:14:40,276
We found a way to live.

426
00:14:40,806 --> 00:14:43,116
The family members split up,

427
00:14:43,276 --> 00:14:45,176
sat in every corner, and ate well.

428
00:14:45,486 --> 00:14:46,816
- That's right.
-  Seriously.

429
00:14:47,516 --> 00:14:49,115
We blended in perfectly.

430
00:14:49,116 --> 00:14:50,186
We sat down quickly.

431
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:52,725
We only had ten dollars, but we each had a bowl of food.

432
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:53,786
I know.

433
00:14:54,056 --> 00:14:55,755
Seriously.

434
00:14:55,756 --> 00:14:57,096
(After having 1 bowl of food each, they'll have a dessert.)

435
00:14:57,796 --> 00:14:58,995
(As Deok Sun's family reminisces about lunch)

436
00:14:58,996 --> 00:15:01,066
Where was the ripe persimmon store?

437
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,265
- There it is.
-  There it is.

438
00:15:02,266 --> 00:15:03,665
- There it is. It's close.
-  There it is.

439
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,195
- I see it.
-  I see it.

440
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:07,505
Do the ripe persimmons have market price?

441
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:08,606
Seedless ripe persimmons.

442
00:15:09,106 --> 00:15:10,435
There are ripe persimmons.

443
00:15:10,436 --> 00:15:12,205
- Where?
-  The truck is right here.

444
00:15:12,206 --> 00:15:13,475
Turn on the hazard lights.

445
00:15:13,476 --> 00:15:14,975
(They only have 33 dollars. How many will they get?)

446
00:15:14,976 --> 00:15:16,276
There you go. Let's get out.

447
00:15:17,976 --> 00:15:20,716
(The Ripe Persimmon Fellowship looks extraordinary.)

448
00:15:21,016 --> 00:15:23,256
- How much do we have?
-  We have 33 dollars.

449
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:25,186
- We have 33 dollars.
-  Did you say 34 dollars?

450
00:15:25,486 --> 00:15:28,156
- We have 32 dollars.
-  We have 32 dollars.

451
00:15:28,486 --> 00:15:30,055
Would it be possible to get two?

452
00:15:30,056 --> 00:15:31,396
I'll give you two boxes.

453
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,365
See? It wouldn't have worked had you guys done it alone.

454
00:15:35,366 --> 00:15:37,066
Our ten dollars were essential.

455
00:15:37,396 --> 00:15:39,535
- We'll put a box in our car.
-  One box in our car,

456
00:15:39,536 --> 00:15:41,166
- one box in your car.
-  Okay.

457
00:15:41,266 --> 00:15:42,306
Let's go.

458
00:15:42,406 --> 00:15:44,676
- Thank you.
-  Thank you.

459
00:15:44,936 --> 00:15:46,246
- Thank you.
-  Let's go.

460
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:47,805
- Thank you.
-  We'll enjoy them.

461
00:15:47,806 --> 00:15:49,176
(Smiling)

462
00:15:50,046 --> 00:15:53,786
(Laughing merrily)

463
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:57,916
(Jung Bong's family puts the persimmons in the trunk.)

464
00:15:59,226 --> 00:16:01,426
They took off merrily with the persimmons.

465
00:16:02,056 --> 00:16:05,296
I think they'll eat in the car.

466
00:16:05,496 --> 00:16:06,965
(Smiling)

467
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,465
Dad!

468
00:16:08,466 --> 00:16:13,006
(He returns in glory.)

469
00:16:13,066 --> 00:16:14,335
(They give Dong Il a round of applause.)

470
00:16:14,336 --> 00:16:16,906
- This is incredible.
-  It really is.

471
00:16:17,806 --> 00:16:20,106
With ten dollars, we had a satisfying meal...

472
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:22,376
and got a box of persimmons.

473
00:16:22,946 --> 00:16:25,015
These persimmons are the top grade.

474
00:16:25,016 --> 00:16:26,085
(The happiness of ten dollars)

475
00:16:26,086 --> 00:16:27,716
- Here.
-  Can we eat them?

476
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:29,015
Peel them.

477
00:16:29,016 --> 00:16:30,315
(Mi Ran was right.)

478
00:16:30,316 --> 00:16:32,285
- Open the box.
-  How will we do that?

479
00:16:32,286 --> 00:16:34,056
- I want to eat them.
-  This is amazing.

480
00:16:34,486 --> 00:16:36,455
Let's film a close shot.

481
00:16:36,456 --> 00:16:38,356
- Will you film an insert?
-  Let's film an insert.

482
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,565
(Hye Ri's camera)

483
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:42,595
- Hold on.
-  Aren't they incredible?

484
00:16:42,596 --> 00:16:43,796
(The amazing persimmons you want to see up close)

485
00:16:43,896 --> 00:16:46,236
(The orange persimmons are glossy.)

486
00:16:46,406 --> 00:16:49,805
Gosh, the texture is soft. It's to die for.

487
00:16:49,806 --> 00:16:51,236
- Oh, my.
-  Gosh.

488
00:16:51,676 --> 00:16:53,676
- My son, here.
-  Okay.

489
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:56,976
Hold it and eat it, you punk. Here. Try it.

490
00:16:57,576 --> 00:16:58,576
(Impressed)

491
00:17:00,316 --> 00:17:01,685
It's so tasty.

492
00:17:01,686 --> 00:17:02,856
(The persimmons are ripe since it's autumn.)

493
00:17:03,586 --> 00:17:05,526
Make sure it doesn't get on your clothes.

494
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:07,156
Try it.

495
00:17:07,286 --> 00:17:08,356
I don't want to do the laundry.

496
00:17:09,126 --> 00:17:10,126
What do you think?

497
00:17:10,127 --> 00:17:11,325
(They're absorbed in the taste.)

498
00:17:11,326 --> 00:17:12,496
Isn't it amazing?

499
00:17:13,096 --> 00:17:15,065
- It's like a candy.
-  Is it like a candy?

500
00:17:15,066 --> 00:17:16,866
- Yes.
-  Yes. Totally.

501
00:17:17,366 --> 00:17:18,366
(Impressed)

502
00:17:19,536 --> 00:17:21,365
My family is enjoying the trip the most.

503
00:17:21,366 --> 00:17:24,336
You're right. It really feels like a trip.

504
00:17:26,176 --> 00:17:27,775
Going on a trip is nice...

505
00:17:27,776 --> 00:17:31,015
because you can enjoy the seasonal food and fruits.

506
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:33,115
- Ripe fruits are so pretty.
-  You're right.

507
00:17:33,116 --> 00:17:34,246
Mom.

508
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:35,856
Honey, eat with your chin up.

509
00:17:36,316 --> 00:17:37,856
Eat with your chin up.

510
00:17:38,156 --> 00:17:39,685
That's so funny.

511
00:17:39,686 --> 00:17:40,686
(It's too tasty.)

512
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:43,426
It's my first time seeing Mom eat so well. Seriously.

513
00:17:43,526 --> 00:17:45,465
We don't have much money,

514
00:17:45,466 --> 00:17:47,226
but we eat the best food.

515
00:17:47,626 --> 00:17:50,496
(They understand themelves perfectly.)

516
00:17:50,896 --> 00:17:53,705
Do you want to give these persimmons to anyone?

517
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:56,035
- I do.
-  Not anyone in our family...

518
00:17:56,036 --> 00:17:57,305
or Jung Bong's family.

519
00:17:57,306 --> 00:17:58,775
- I do.
-  Who?

520
00:17:58,776 --> 00:17:59,846
Taek.

521
00:18:00,476 --> 00:18:01,546
Sun Woo.

522
00:18:02,176 --> 00:18:03,246
Do you want to give it to Taek?

523
00:18:03,846 --> 00:18:06,046
They only look after their boyfriends.

524
00:18:06,646 --> 00:18:09,316
I'll tell Jae Myung, Moo Sung, and Sun Young.

525
00:18:10,086 --> 00:18:11,956
- Jung Bong.
-  We...

526
00:18:12,056 --> 00:18:14,356
(We just like them.)

527
00:18:14,786 --> 00:18:16,426
My belly became big.

528
00:18:17,056 --> 00:18:19,365
- Her belly became big.
-  You don't need to show us.

529
00:18:19,366 --> 00:18:20,395
(Covering up)

530
00:18:20,396 --> 00:18:23,995
Hey, she was like that even when we filmed the drama.

531
00:18:23,996 --> 00:18:26,066
- That's right.
-  She has always been like that.

532
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:27,506
I want to take off...

533
00:18:27,636 --> 00:18:29,335
She always unbuttons her pants when she eats.

534
00:18:29,336 --> 00:18:30,876
- Yes, she always unbuttons them.
-  I see.

535
00:18:31,406 --> 00:18:32,976
Even during the drama shoot,

536
00:18:33,006 --> 00:18:34,045
she went upstairs...

537
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:35,445
- and freeloaded numerous times.
-  Yes.

538
00:18:35,446 --> 00:18:36,446
- I remember.
-  She did.

539
00:18:36,447 --> 00:18:38,216
(Today is no different from 10 years ago.)

540
00:18:38,346 --> 00:18:40,116
There was a scene of me...

541
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:42,155
eating dried yellow corvina at Jung Bong's place.

542
00:18:42,156 --> 00:18:44,486
I even ripped the head off and ate it whole.

543
00:18:44,586 --> 00:18:45,725
You did.

544
00:18:45,726 --> 00:18:47,885
(Dong Il and Il Hwa were invited over for dinner at Jung Bong's.)

545
00:18:47,886 --> 00:18:49,326
Dig in, Dong Il.

546
00:18:51,526 --> 00:18:53,296
Goodness gracious.

547
00:18:53,926 --> 00:18:54,995
Goodness.

548
00:18:54,996 --> 00:18:56,466
(Trying his first-ever dried yellow corvina)

549
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:02,405
(Eating dried yellow corvina without a thought for his wife)

550
00:19:02,406 --> 00:19:03,605
(Besides this...)

551
00:19:03,606 --> 00:19:04,776
It's delicious.

552
00:19:05,106 --> 00:19:06,805
(What Deok Sun's family was treated to)

553
00:19:06,806 --> 00:19:09,715
(Spaghetti)

554
00:19:09,716 --> 00:19:12,246
(Ginseng liquor)

555
00:19:12,486 --> 00:19:14,246
(Big cake)

556
00:19:17,116 --> 00:19:19,485
(To the point of wanting to stay at Jung Bong's forever,)

557
00:19:19,486 --> 00:19:21,926
(Deok Sun's family overstayed their welcome.)

558
00:19:22,226 --> 00:19:24,525
We were a wealthy family in "Reply 1988."

559
00:19:24,526 --> 00:19:25,626
True.

560
00:19:25,866 --> 00:19:28,466
(Living by noblesse oblige)

561
00:19:29,366 --> 00:19:30,495
This feels like...

562
00:19:30,496 --> 00:19:31,795
- a national holiday.
-  I know, right?

563
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:33,405
- It did when we were all together.
-  Yes.

564
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:35,675
Like gathering at the main house...

565
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:37,436
and catching up with the relatives after some time.

566
00:19:37,936 --> 00:19:39,745
Drinking all day.

567
00:19:39,746 --> 00:19:41,345
And there's one uncle who keeps picking fights.

568
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,616
(A typical holiday thing)

569
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:44,916
How old are you?

570
00:19:45,016 --> 00:19:46,215
I'm now 41 years old.

571
00:19:46,216 --> 00:19:47,985
- Really?
-  Yes.

572
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:49,185
- Dong Hwi.
-  Yes?

573
00:19:49,186 --> 00:19:50,585
You're old now.

574
00:19:50,586 --> 00:19:51,656
Of course.

575
00:19:52,056 --> 00:19:53,586
- You're 41?
-  Yes.

576
00:19:53,726 --> 00:19:55,596
International age-wise, I'm 40.

577
00:19:55,956 --> 00:19:57,226
Goodness, 40?

578
00:19:57,326 --> 00:19:58,426
You're at the age of clarity.

579
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:00,695
How old are you, Bo Gum?

580
00:20:00,696 --> 00:20:02,535
- I'm 32.
-  You're 32.

581
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:04,536
Does that mean you were 22 back then?

582
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:06,536
- A total baby.
-  Gosh.

583
00:20:06,566 --> 00:20:08,336
I was 22 years old 10 years ago.

584
00:20:08,736 --> 00:20:10,906
Back then, were you all in your 20s?

585
00:20:11,136 --> 00:20:12,136
Yes.

586
00:20:12,137 --> 00:20:13,206
(Back then, 28 and 30 years old)

587
00:20:13,476 --> 00:20:14,746
We were really young.

588
00:20:15,176 --> 00:20:16,816
Especially, Sung Kyun.

589
00:20:17,546 --> 00:20:20,245
- Sung Kyun was in his 30s.
-  Weren't you 34?

590
00:20:20,246 --> 00:20:21,386
- I was a baby.
-  Totally.

591
00:20:21,516 --> 00:20:22,685
He played a father...

592
00:20:22,686 --> 00:20:25,215
- in his 30s.
-  A father.

593
00:20:25,216 --> 00:20:26,755
- That was funny.
-  And his son was...

594
00:20:26,756 --> 00:20:28,256
only six years younger.

595
00:20:28,286 --> 00:20:29,725
I never called him "Dad."

596
00:20:29,726 --> 00:20:32,196
- It was always "Father." - Father.

597
00:20:32,566 --> 00:20:33,625
Father is home.

598
00:20:33,626 --> 00:20:34,665
(Being polite)

599
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,795
- Normally, there are scenes...
-  Yes?

600
00:20:36,796 --> 00:20:39,005
of families going on trips...

601
00:20:39,006 --> 00:20:41,465
in dramas, like outdoor scenes.

602
00:20:41,466 --> 00:20:42,976
But "Reply 1988" didn't have any.

603
00:20:43,436 --> 00:20:44,536
Our shoots...

604
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:46,876
- were only at the set.
-  Yes.

605
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,015
- We never left the area.
-  The farthest...

606
00:20:49,016 --> 00:20:50,275
we went...

607
00:20:50,276 --> 00:20:51,516
was the pork cutlet place.

608
00:20:51,946 --> 00:20:53,016
Right.

609
00:20:53,716 --> 00:20:55,515
I recall the three of us sitting in the back on our way...

610
00:20:55,516 --> 00:20:57,155
to the pork cutlet place.

611
00:20:57,156 --> 00:20:59,885
- The top was made for that...
-  Right.

612
00:20:59,886 --> 00:21:01,786
shoulder pad scene with the kids.

613
00:21:02,086 --> 00:21:03,895
So the kids were squeezed in the back...

614
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:06,466
because of the shoulder pads.

615
00:21:10,236 --> 00:21:13,536
(Ms. Cheetah dressed up for the family's dine-out)

616
00:21:14,236 --> 00:21:15,936
(Flinching)

617
00:21:16,806 --> 00:21:17,875
Honey,

618
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:19,646
what did you stuff in your shoulders?

619
00:21:26,686 --> 00:21:28,915
(Because of the wide shoulders,)

620
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:31,156
(there wasn't much space in the back.)

621
00:21:33,356 --> 00:21:37,396
(Jung Bong's family came to a trendy Western-style diner.)

622
00:21:39,866 --> 00:21:42,836
(Taking an elegant bite)

623
00:21:43,266 --> 00:21:47,136
(Jung Bong family's only memory outside of Ssangmun-dong)

624
00:21:47,266 --> 00:21:49,205
All of our soundtracks are nice.

625
00:21:49,206 --> 00:21:50,676
- Exactly.
-  They're a killer.

626
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:53,676
(Park Bo Gum, playlist curator)

627
00:21:53,806 --> 00:21:55,106
(Stay)

628
00:21:56,216 --> 00:21:59,616
(Admiration on play)

629
00:22:00,016 --> 00:22:02,386
How are you all so good at singing?

630
00:22:02,916 --> 00:22:04,915
- Oh, my.
-  Not me.

631
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:05,985
- Me neither.
-  No way.

632
00:22:05,986 --> 00:22:07,625
Nonsense. You're the best singer.

633
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:10,256
- Everyone's amazing at singing.
-  Gosh.

634
00:22:12,396 --> 00:22:15,996
(This is Dong Hwi.)

635
00:22:18,396 --> 00:22:20,965
(A half-singer who even sang...)

636
00:22:20,966 --> 00:22:23,876
(on "Show! Music Core" as MSG Wannabe)

637
00:22:23,936 --> 00:22:25,205
You're a total singer.

638
00:22:25,206 --> 00:22:27,376
(Acting cute)

639
00:22:27,406 --> 00:22:29,515
- This is all I can do.
-  Did you want to become a singer?

640
00:22:29,516 --> 00:22:31,115
No, never.

641
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:32,746
(But Dong Hwi has released over 10 tracks.)

642
00:22:33,016 --> 00:22:35,146
The video of Kyung Pyo singing.

643
00:22:35,246 --> 00:22:37,416
It hit over ten million views.

644
00:22:37,716 --> 00:22:39,086
What? Which video is it?

645
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:45,325
(Hitting a whopping 18 million views...)

646
00:22:45,326 --> 00:22:48,626
(is Kyung Pyo's live performance of "We Used to Love.")

647
00:22:48,766 --> 00:22:50,795
- Bo Gum is incredible at singing.
-  Bo Gum is...

648
00:22:50,796 --> 00:22:52,566
even good at playing the piano.

649
00:22:53,866 --> 00:22:55,905
(Bo Gum hosted KBS's music show,)

650
00:22:55,906 --> 00:22:58,205
("Park Bo Gum's Cantabile.")

651
00:22:58,206 --> 00:23:02,776
(Hosted, performed, and sang flawlessly)

652
00:23:04,576 --> 00:23:06,715
I actually wanted to become a singer-songwriter.

653
00:23:06,716 --> 00:23:07,915
I knew it.

654
00:23:07,916 --> 00:23:09,916
Did you train as a singer first?

655
00:23:10,116 --> 00:23:11,986
I didn't undergo training.

656
00:23:12,356 --> 00:23:15,025
I simply recorded videos of myself singing while playing the piano...

657
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:16,456
and applied for auditions.

658
00:23:16,696 --> 00:23:19,126
But I was told I was more suited to acting than singing.

659
00:23:20,196 --> 00:23:22,365
- You do both now.
-  Yes.

660
00:23:22,366 --> 00:23:23,736
- Your dream came true.
-  That's nice.

661
00:23:25,296 --> 00:23:26,505
I'm grateful.

662
00:23:26,506 --> 00:23:27,536
(Bo Gum is good at everything!)

663
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:29,276
I'm most jealous of people who can sing well.

664
00:23:29,776 --> 00:23:31,005
- If...
-  But you're good at it.

665
00:23:31,006 --> 00:23:33,805
I could be born again, I would want...

666
00:23:33,806 --> 00:23:35,506
- to become a singer.
-  Same.

667
00:23:35,676 --> 00:23:38,116
- Aren't singers so cool?
-  Absolutely.

668
00:23:38,246 --> 00:23:40,215
For me,

669
00:23:40,216 --> 00:23:41,646
those are dancers.

670
00:23:42,016 --> 00:23:43,516
People who dance.

671
00:23:43,856 --> 00:23:45,015
Humans...

672
00:23:45,016 --> 00:23:47,526
- want what they don't have.
-  Yes.

673
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:49,625
- Aren't you good at dancing?
-  No.

674
00:23:49,626 --> 00:23:50,955
He's good at dancing.

675
00:23:50,956 --> 00:23:52,665
- Right? He's a dancer, isn't he?
-  He's got a good sense of rhythm.

676
00:23:52,666 --> 00:23:55,196
During the "Reply 1988" shoot,

677
00:23:55,396 --> 00:23:57,595
Sobangcha almost killed me.

678
00:23:57,596 --> 00:23:58,766
(Sobangcha almost killed me.)

679
00:23:59,166 --> 00:24:01,005
(The behind-the-scenes video of "Reply 1988")

00:24:02,436 --> 00:24:03,976
(A klutz playing an expert)

682
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,775
Copying her is confusing.

683
00:24:05,776 --> 00:24:07,306
I know, right? What now?

684
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:12,215
(Dong Hwi, who practiced hard through the hardship)

685
00:24:12,216 --> 00:24:13,445

686
00:24:13,446 --> 00:24:16,616

(Serious)

(They melted the hearts of Ssangmun Girls' High students...)

690
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:29,566
(with the perfectly synced performance.)

691
00:24:31,836 --> 00:24:35,466
(He wrapped it up as the ending fairy.)

692
00:24:35,876 --> 00:24:37,306
We're ten minutes away now.

693
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:38,836
Good.

694
00:24:38,976 --> 00:24:41,605
(Bo Gum chooses the last song before they arrive.)

695
00:24:41,606 --> 00:24:42,676
Isn't that...

696
00:24:44,016 --> 00:24:46,016
(We're here.)

697
00:24:46,286 --> 00:24:49,256
(An overwhelming rhythm wakes everyone in the car)

698
00:24:49,916 --> 00:24:53,026
(Driving along the vast Goseong beach,)

699
00:24:56,056 --> 00:24:59,055

00:25:04,396 --> 00:25:07,166
(Arrived at the house in Goseong)

704
00:25:08,066 --> 00:25:09,905
It's right in front of the ocean.

705
00:25:09,906 --> 00:25:10,906
(Amazed)

706
00:25:12,376 --> 00:25:14,845
- Great work. Thank you, Sung Won.
-  Thank you.

707
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:15,915
Good job.

708
00:25:15,916 --> 00:25:18,046
- Thank you.
-  You did well.

709
00:25:18,376 --> 00:25:20,145
- Are we first?
-  I think so.

710
00:25:20,146 --> 00:25:22,146
- First.
-  We beat everyone.

711
00:25:22,446 --> 00:25:23,955
- First.
-  Yes, first.

712
00:25:23,956 --> 00:25:25,216
(Deok Sun's family is happy to have arrived first.)

713
00:25:25,356 --> 00:25:26,456
What?

714
00:25:26,926 --> 00:25:28,456
- What nice breeze.
-  Right?

715
00:25:28,626 --> 00:25:30,656
(Impressed)

716
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:32,125
You're loud, girl.

717
00:25:32,126 --> 00:25:33,996
(Screaming)

718
00:25:35,096 --> 00:25:38,196
(The reason Hye Ri is excited)

719
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:41,336
(Before her eyes)

720
00:25:41,736 --> 00:25:43,535
"I hear, I reply,"

721
00:25:43,536 --> 00:25:44,875
"and longing answers."

722
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:45,906
(A welcome banner, a must on trips)

723
00:25:46,946 --> 00:25:50,016
(Because a big house welcomes the family.)

724
00:25:50,946 --> 00:25:54,016
(Here's the house we'll stay in for 2 days and 1 night.)

725
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,956
(The big dining table, right before the entrance,)

726
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:01,256
(will soon be full.)

727
00:26:01,986 --> 00:26:04,796
(Go up to the 4th floor,)

728
00:26:06,296 --> 00:26:08,766
(and there's a space for the YB.)

729
00:26:09,226 --> 00:26:12,095
(On the dining table with the East Sea view,)

730
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:16,276
(the YB will chat all night long.)

731
00:26:16,536 --> 00:26:18,205
(Past the dining table...)

732
00:26:18,206 --> 00:26:20,206
(is a cozy living room.)

733
00:26:22,376 --> 00:26:24,276
(Next to it are Min Ji's room,)

734
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:26,446
(and Hye Young and Hye Ri's room.)

735
00:26:27,286 --> 00:26:29,956
(Go up the stairs next to the entrance,)

736
00:26:30,616 --> 00:26:33,856
(and there's a spacious attic for the sons.)

737
00:26:35,186 --> 00:26:39,096
(This is Goseong Ssangmun-dong, where we'll be staying.)

738
00:26:42,066 --> 00:26:43,365
(Impressed)

739
00:26:43,366 --> 00:26:44,665
What a big house.

740
00:26:44,666 --> 00:26:45,666
I know, right?

741
00:26:45,667 --> 00:26:47,766
- We won't have to fight over rooms.
-  Exactly.

742
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:50,106
What a warm welcome.

743
00:26:50,576 --> 00:26:51,705
How is this a welcome?

744
00:26:51,706 --> 00:26:54,006
There's only one banner up.

745
00:26:54,706 --> 00:26:57,015
That's right. Mi Ran came with you, right?

746
00:26:57,016 --> 00:26:58,046
Yes.

747
00:26:59,846 --> 00:27:00,946
Hey.

748
00:27:01,446 --> 00:27:02,486
(Laughing)

749
00:27:02,686 --> 00:27:03,686
What...

750
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:06,886
Looking at you from here...

751
00:27:06,956 --> 00:27:08,086
Mother.

752
00:27:08,186 --> 00:27:09,526
You really stand out.

753
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,925
It's different from before.

754
00:27:10,926 --> 00:27:12,126
Do I stand out too much?

755
00:27:13,026 --> 00:27:14,626
Does anyone have an air gun?

756
00:27:15,666 --> 00:27:17,195
- An air gun, anyone?
-  Bang.

757
00:27:17,196 --> 00:27:18,436
(It hurts.)

758
00:27:19,296 --> 00:27:20,906
(Amazed)

759
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:23,206
(What's welcoming them?)

760
00:27:23,676 --> 00:27:24,776
They are in different sizes.

761
00:27:25,436 --> 00:27:27,546
The medium seems like mine.

762
00:27:28,306 --> 00:27:30,476
(Peeking)

763
00:27:30,646 --> 00:27:33,086
(Impressed)

764
00:27:33,146 --> 00:27:35,316
- It must be some merchandise.
-  Seems like it.

765
00:27:36,416 --> 00:27:38,916
(A merchandise kit for the Ssangmun-dong family)

766
00:27:40,086 --> 00:27:41,926
(There's literally everything inside.)

767
00:27:42,326 --> 00:27:44,125
(From must-have props for a trip...)

768
00:27:44,126 --> 00:27:46,396
(to cute goodies)

769
00:27:48,196 --> 00:27:52,596
(It's packed with memories from "Reply 1988.")

770
00:27:55,036 --> 00:27:58,075
(In their rooms throughout the trip)

771
00:27:58,076 --> 00:27:59,235
(Amazed)

772
00:27:59,236 --> 00:28:00,305
(Amazed)

773
00:28:00,306 --> 00:28:01,706
- This one's so pretty.
-  Right?

774
00:28:02,206 --> 00:28:06,716
(They open it again and again.)

775
00:28:07,086 --> 00:28:08,386
(Impressed)

776
00:28:08,886 --> 00:28:12,556
(Tomorrow, the families will wear the merchandise jacket together.)

777
00:28:12,686 --> 00:28:15,326
- I'll call out the last row.
-  Okay.

778
00:28:15,386 --> 00:28:17,826
Kim Sun Young, Lee Il Hwa, Ra Mi Ran.

779
00:28:17,926 --> 00:28:20,196
Take your hat off. It's covering our faces.

780
00:28:21,026 --> 00:28:22,095
(Taking off)

781
00:28:22,096 --> 00:28:23,536
(Laughing)

782
00:28:24,096 --> 00:28:26,306
- Bo Gum.
-  Bo Gum isn't here.

783
00:28:26,766 --> 00:28:28,635
- Bo Gum.
-  Bo Gum's hair.

784
00:28:28,636 --> 00:28:30,175
- Hey.
-  Because of his wig.

785
00:28:30,176 --> 00:28:31,505
Is he wearing a wig?

786
00:28:31,506 --> 00:28:32,846
Bo Gum!

787
00:28:33,306 --> 00:28:34,505
Hurry up!

788
00:28:34,506 --> 00:28:35,606
I'm sorry!

789
00:28:35,676 --> 00:28:37,145
- Over here.
-  Be careful of your wig.

790
00:28:37,146 --> 00:28:38,345
- Be careful.
-  Oh, dear.

791
00:28:38,346 --> 00:28:39,785
It's slippery, Bo Gum.

792
00:28:39,786 --> 00:28:41,816
- Sorry.
-  Over here.

793
00:28:41,946 --> 00:28:43,416
It's hard to gather up.

794
00:28:44,386 --> 00:28:45,655
Fix your bangs.

795
00:28:45,656 --> 00:28:47,455
- What do we look at?
-  Where do we look?

796
00:28:47,456 --> 00:28:48,856
What did we do with our hands?

797
00:28:49,326 --> 00:28:51,396
- We sat on the ground.
-  Two, three.

798
00:28:53,166 --> 00:28:54,265
(Ta-da!)

799
00:28:54,266 --> 00:28:56,296
(A lousy pose in a rush)

800
00:28:56,596 --> 00:28:58,236
(Meanwhile, the 2nd row is...)

801
00:28:58,296 --> 00:28:59,365
(Proud two thumbs-ups)

802
00:28:59,366 --> 00:29:00,465
That wasn't what you did.

803
00:29:00,466 --> 00:29:02,266
(Feeling small)

804
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,876
I need her.

805
00:29:05,606 --> 00:29:08,346
(Information: Sun Woo had Jin Ju in his arms.)

806
00:29:09,406 --> 00:29:12,986
(Sun Woo left Jin Ju's space open.)

807
00:29:13,316 --> 00:29:14,716
Let's make the tenth anniversary pose.

808
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:16,586
- Like this.
-  Okay.

809
00:29:16,816 --> 00:29:18,155
(Like this?)

810
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:19,626
- Ten.
-  The tenth anniversary?

811
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:22,125
(A Morse code?)

812
00:29:22,126 --> 00:29:23,556
- Hold up your right.
-  Okay.

813
00:29:23,726 --> 00:29:24,796
I'm going to do this.

814
00:29:25,056 --> 00:29:26,195
Do as you fit.

815
00:29:26,196 --> 00:29:28,396
(Someone always takes his own course.)

816
00:29:28,696 --> 00:29:30,265
Hold up your right. I'll hold up my left.

817
00:29:30,266 --> 00:29:31,336
Let's make ten together.

818
00:29:32,096 --> 00:29:33,535
(United)

819
00:29:33,536 --> 00:29:35,465
(Someone always takes the easy way out.)

820
00:29:35,466 --> 00:29:37,236
- Let's move on right away.
-  All done.

821
00:29:37,506 --> 00:29:39,106
- Good.
-  All set.

822
00:29:39,576 --> 00:29:42,376
(With that, the photo became a beautiful poster.)

823
00:29:43,376 --> 00:29:46,386
(Isn't it the same as 10 years ago?)

824
00:29:46,986 --> 00:29:48,645
(YB takes the 4th floor. OB takes the 2nd and 3rd floors.)

825
00:29:48,646 --> 00:29:50,886
- Nice.
-  What's this?

826
00:29:51,116 --> 00:29:53,386
- The place is great.
-  For real.

827
00:29:53,486 --> 00:29:54,655
Amazing.

828
00:29:54,656 --> 00:29:56,326
Gosh, nice.

829
00:29:57,256 --> 00:29:59,355
An attic.

830
00:29:59,356 --> 00:30:00,395
(The YB members gather on the 4th floor.)

831
00:30:00,396 --> 00:30:01,496
There's more.

832
00:30:01,596 --> 00:30:02,725
- Gosh.
-  My gosh.

833
00:30:02,726 --> 00:30:04,696
You take this room, and we take the attic.

834
00:30:05,436 --> 00:30:08,305
(Each finds their rooms while admiring)

835
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:10,035
- Gosh.
-  How cute.

836
00:30:10,036 --> 00:30:12,075
It says, "Ryu Hye Young and Hye Ri."

837
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:13,445
- It does?
-  Yes.

838
00:30:13,446 --> 00:30:15,475
- Do I get special treatment?
-  Special treatment?

839
00:30:15,476 --> 00:30:16,715
Nice.

840
00:30:16,716 --> 00:30:18,215
(Laughing)

841
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:20,015
- She said, "Nice." - Nice.

842
00:30:20,016 --> 00:30:21,046
(For being old)

843
00:30:21,116 --> 00:30:24,916
(Dong Hwi heads to the attic that's half a floor up.)

844
00:30:25,186 --> 00:30:28,126
(Attic, YB boys' room)

845
00:30:28,256 --> 00:30:29,286
Gosh.

846
00:30:29,526 --> 00:30:30,526
Goodness.

847
00:30:30,527 --> 00:30:32,396
(He can't help but groan.)

848
00:30:33,596 --> 00:30:36,736
(For some reason, No Eul looks slouched.)

849
00:30:36,896 --> 00:30:38,795
I'd love to get some Thai massage.

850
00:30:38,796 --> 00:30:40,865
Jae Hong.

851
00:30:40,866 --> 00:30:43,176
- Have some coffee, Sung Won.
-  Jae Hong.

852
00:30:43,476 --> 00:30:45,975
It's been two years since I last drove out...

853
00:30:45,976 --> 00:30:47,706
- Yes?
-  beyond Gyeonggi Province.

854
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:49,716
I rarely go outside.

855
00:30:49,746 --> 00:30:52,716
It was also raining.

856
00:30:53,546 --> 00:30:55,316
As you said,

857
00:30:55,646 --> 00:30:57,385
we had to drive safely.

858
00:30:57,386 --> 00:30:58,386
(No Eul)

859
00:30:58,416 --> 00:31:00,526
Because Park Bo Gum was sitting in the passenger seat,

860
00:31:00,756 --> 00:31:02,486
I broke out in a cold sweat.

861
00:31:03,326 --> 00:31:05,596
Driving with Park Bo Gum in the car...

862
00:31:06,196 --> 00:31:07,666
isn't easy.

863
00:31:07,896 --> 00:31:10,796
I had Sung Kyun and Mi Ran with me in the back.

864
00:31:11,296 --> 00:31:12,335
It felt like my parents...

865
00:31:12,336 --> 00:31:13,365
- were in the car.
-  Right?

866
00:31:13,366 --> 00:31:14,706
(Hazardous driving conditions)

867
00:31:16,276 --> 00:31:17,705
We won't drive the way back, will we?

868
00:31:17,706 --> 00:31:19,136
No, that'll be...

869
00:31:19,606 --> 00:31:21,245
- All the way to Chuncheon.
-  That's...

870
00:31:21,246 --> 00:31:22,945
I'm afraid I must decline.

871
00:31:22,946 --> 00:31:24,476
I'm taking the bullet train.

872
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:25,816
It's just too tiresome.

873
00:31:25,876 --> 00:31:28,386
(While the drivers rest a bit,)

874
00:31:28,716 --> 00:31:31,056
(those downstairs are unpacking.)

875
00:31:31,156 --> 00:31:32,926
- Shall I show you my pajamas?
-  Yes.

876
00:31:33,456 --> 00:31:35,326
- I brought really cute ones.
-  It's so you.

877
00:31:35,726 --> 00:31:37,795
- These are what I brought.
-  Cute.

878
00:31:37,796 --> 00:31:39,595
You brought a set of pajamas?

879
00:31:39,596 --> 00:31:40,766
(Showing off to the girls)

880
00:31:41,396 --> 00:31:42,866
What are you going to wear?

881
00:31:43,166 --> 00:31:44,596
Sweatsuits?

882
00:31:44,966 --> 00:31:46,806
Probably. What about you?

883
00:31:46,936 --> 00:31:48,436
Me? I'm not sure.

884
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:50,536
- I'll just wear sweatsuits.
-  How about...

885
00:31:50,736 --> 00:31:52,036
Like what? Show me.

886
00:31:52,946 --> 00:31:54,275
(Outfit check by Hye Ri on the other side)

887
00:31:54,276 --> 00:31:56,475
This top with gray pants.

888
00:31:56,476 --> 00:31:57,916
It's nice, very fashionista-like.

889
00:31:57,946 --> 00:31:59,016
I like it.

890
00:32:00,016 --> 00:32:02,186
What's this? That's a pretty outfit.

891
00:32:02,416 --> 00:32:04,055
I brought separate pajamas.

892
00:32:04,056 --> 00:32:06,156
(Scanning how dressed up she is)

893
00:32:06,386 --> 00:32:08,986
So it's not full-on sweatsuits. Okay.

894
00:32:09,526 --> 00:32:12,196
(While Min Ji is back to her dilemma,)

895
00:32:12,826 --> 00:32:15,166
(Deok Sun helps put makeup on Bo Ra.)

896
00:32:15,226 --> 00:32:16,836
Why does it smell delicious?

897
00:32:17,596 --> 00:32:18,936
Delicious?

898
00:32:19,336 --> 00:32:20,436
It smells sweet.

899
00:32:20,806 --> 00:32:21,836
Is it your lips?

900
00:32:22,066 --> 00:32:23,905
What? Are you flirting with me?

901
00:32:23,906 --> 00:32:24,935
No.

902
00:32:24,936 --> 00:32:26,746
(A sudden flirt attack)

903
00:32:26,906 --> 00:32:29,176
That's weird. For real.

904
00:32:29,476 --> 00:32:30,875
It smells sweet.

905
00:32:30,876 --> 00:32:32,016
- Is it your lips?
-  "Is it your lips?"

906
00:32:33,946 --> 00:32:35,045
Isn't that flirting?

907
00:32:35,046 --> 00:32:36,046
(The room has suddenly become hot.)

908
00:32:36,047 --> 00:32:37,616
- That's flirting.
-  I'm shocked myself.

909
00:32:38,086 --> 00:32:41,286
- Hold on. You were flirting.
-  No, that was the truth.

910
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,995
- It's 4pm.
-  What?

911
00:32:43,996 --> 00:32:45,196
It's 4pm.

912
00:32:45,556 --> 00:32:46,566
Come on down.

913
00:32:47,666 --> 00:32:49,526
(He's now the gatekeeper.)

914
00:32:49,966 --> 00:32:51,465
You really had it tough.

915
00:32:51,466 --> 00:32:52,535
Don't worry about it.

916
00:32:52,536 --> 00:32:54,136
(Hugging Dong Hwi for driving the car)

917
00:32:55,466 --> 00:32:58,206
(Shall we go and play some games?)

918
00:32:58,506 --> 00:32:59,805
- Do we sit anywhere?
-  Yes, anywhere.

919
00:32:59,806 --> 00:33:01,275
- Sit anywhere, - Sit anywhere?

920
00:33:01,276 --> 00:33:02,975
- and they'll reassign our seats.
-  Sit wherever...

921
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:03,976
you think is your seat.

922
00:33:04,546 --> 00:33:05,745
Sit,

923
00:33:05,746 --> 00:33:08,046
- and we'll reassign your seats.
-  Got it.

924
00:33:08,686 --> 00:33:10,155
(At the center of the wall...)

925
00:33:10,156 --> 00:33:12,155
(is a strange banner.)

926
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:13,825
This is Reply 1988 10th Anniversary,

927
00:33:13,826 --> 00:33:15,485
but why is it you two?

928
00:33:15,486 --> 00:33:16,725
- I know, right?
-  Sorry.

929
00:33:16,726 --> 00:33:18,456
- What is that?
-  We made the wrong order.

930
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:20,865
As the theme is "Family Entertainment,"

931
00:33:20,866 --> 00:33:23,535
- we tried to look like Heo Cham.
-  Listen.

932
00:33:23,536 --> 00:33:26,466
I couldn't recognize you two because of the sharp jawlines.

933
00:33:27,166 --> 00:33:29,875
I thought I'd be hosting with Won Ho,

934
00:33:29,876 --> 00:33:31,575
but he's not here.

935
00:33:31,576 --> 00:33:33,205
- Where is he?
-  Where did he go?

936
00:33:33,206 --> 00:33:34,275
Judging by the game...

937
00:33:34,276 --> 00:33:35,306
- we did earlier, - Is he sleeping?

938
00:33:35,576 --> 00:33:37,346
Won Ho shouldn't be hosting.

939
00:33:37,976 --> 00:33:39,376
He gets nervous.

940
00:33:40,086 --> 00:33:42,916
(Hosting after 20 years was too much for Won Ho.)

941
00:33:43,186 --> 00:33:45,686
- Maybe he wants to leave.
-  He must be tired. Extremely tired.

942
00:33:46,116 --> 00:33:48,955
The theme this time is "Family Entertainment..."

943
00:33:48,956 --> 00:33:51,196
together with the Ssangmun-dong residents.

944
00:33:51,496 --> 00:33:53,595
We'd appreciate it if you sat with your families.

945
00:33:53,596 --> 00:33:55,896
- Five from Deok Sun's family.
-  Okay.

946
00:33:56,296 --> 00:33:58,095
- Five from Jung Bon's family.
-  Okay.

947
00:33:58,096 --> 00:33:59,166
Taek's family.

948
00:33:59,666 --> 00:34:01,436
Give instructions for our family too.

949
00:34:01,566 --> 00:34:02,836
The problem is that...

950
00:34:03,076 --> 00:34:05,605
Lee Dong Hwi kept avoiding...

951
00:34:05,606 --> 00:34:07,275
- his father.
-  True.

952
00:34:07,276 --> 00:34:09,875
Being with your father might make things uncomfortable.

953
00:34:09,876 --> 00:34:12,115
Dong Hwi will join Jung Bong's family.

954
00:34:12,116 --> 00:34:14,385
- Got it.
-  Please make your way there.

955
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:17,286
That's only going to weaken our team strategy.

956
00:34:19,616 --> 00:34:21,285
(Teams for Family Entertainment)

957
00:34:21,286 --> 00:34:22,955
(Team Deok Sun)

958
00:34:22,956 --> 00:34:24,195
(Sung Dong Il, Lee II Hwa,)

959
00:34:24,196 --> 00:34:25,396

(Kim Jung Bong, Jang Mi Ok, Ryu Dong Ryong)

963
00:34:29,596 --> 00:34:31,535
(Team Taek, Sun Woo, and Dong Ryong's Dad)

964
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:32,765
(Choi Moo Sung, Kim Sun Young,)

965
00:34:32,766 --> 00:34:34,006
(Choi Taek, Sung Sun Woo, Ryu Jae Myung)

966
00:34:34,536 --> 00:34:35,605
The theme is Family Entertainment.

967
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:37,876
Over there is Team Deok Sun.

968
00:34:38,606 --> 00:34:40,246
(Team Deok Sun)

969
00:34:40,376 --> 00:34:42,605
Team Deok Sun. Sung Dong Il is the father, yes?

970
00:34:42,606 --> 00:34:43,675
- Yes.
-  Good.

971
00:34:43,676 --> 00:34:45,316
Please boast about your family.

972
00:34:46,316 --> 00:34:48,485
- Our family already made it...
-  Yes?

973
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:49,985
- quite obvious today, - Okay.

974
00:34:49,986 --> 00:34:52,786
but we're very brazen despite being poor, cling to others easily,

975
00:34:52,956 --> 00:34:54,986
and are full of energy.

976
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:57,526
The minute you came to the service area,

977
00:34:57,796 --> 00:34:59,195
you ate other people's food...

978
00:34:59,196 --> 00:35:01,226
as if it were yours, even though you had no money.

979
00:35:01,926 --> 00:35:03,365
That's how I educated my children...

980
00:35:03,366 --> 00:35:05,095
- from a young age.
-  How?

981
00:35:05,096 --> 00:35:06,935
The one who eats the food owns it.

982
00:35:06,936 --> 00:35:08,235
- Yes.
-  I see.

983
00:35:08,236 --> 00:35:10,475
Our very generous Lee Il Hwa.

984
00:35:10,476 --> 00:35:13,075
Do you trust anyone in your family...

985
00:35:13,076 --> 00:35:15,776
when it comes to games?

986
00:35:17,446 --> 00:35:18,775
- Your son and daughter?
-  My son and daughter.

987
00:35:18,776 --> 00:35:20,485
- What about your eldest?
-  I...

988
00:35:20,486 --> 00:35:22,546
- My eldest is...
-  I'm a cheerleader.

989
00:35:22,746 --> 00:35:24,255
As my eldest...

990
00:35:24,256 --> 00:35:26,215
- did a 180, - Yes?

991
00:35:26,216 --> 00:35:27,526
- I believe she's the dark horse.
-  I see.

992
00:35:28,056 --> 00:35:30,155
It was a shocker. I wonder if the others noticed.

993
00:35:30,156 --> 00:35:31,695
If I were to put it melodramatically,

994
00:35:31,696 --> 00:35:33,266
she returned as a wacko after ten years.

995
00:35:33,966 --> 00:35:35,796
- Her personality changed entirely.
-  True.

996
00:35:36,596 --> 00:35:37,865
(Ssangmun-dong Family Entertainment's Second Team)

997
00:35:37,866 --> 00:35:39,395
All right, Team Jung Bong.

998
00:35:39,396 --> 00:35:41,006
Ms. Ra Mi Ran.

999
00:35:41,236 --> 00:35:42,665
- Is there anyone you trust?
-  Yes?

1000
00:35:42,666 --> 00:35:44,436
- Like a dark horse.
-  Well...

1001
00:35:44,636 --> 00:35:46,775
- All of our family members...
-  Yes?

1002
00:35:46,776 --> 00:35:49,475
- were good at games.
-  Who did well earlier today?

1003
00:35:49,476 --> 00:35:51,146
- Who?
-  Who did well earlier today?

1004
00:35:51,446 --> 00:35:53,485
- Jae Hong got everything right.
-  I knew it.

1005
00:35:53,486 --> 00:35:55,246
Everyone did a great job.

1006
00:35:55,346 --> 00:35:56,886
I think our family...

1007
00:35:56,956 --> 00:35:59,156
has a fundamental trait that attracts wealth.

1008
00:35:59,686 --> 00:36:01,085
A family blessed by the deity.

1009
00:36:01,086 --> 00:36:02,825
You are the wealthiest...

1010
00:36:02,826 --> 00:36:04,195
in Ssangmun-dong.

1011
00:36:04,196 --> 00:36:05,725
- Yes.
-  As a matter of fact,

1012
00:36:05,726 --> 00:36:06,726
that family treated us...

1013
00:36:06,727 --> 00:36:07,765
- to all the food today.
-  True.

1014
00:36:07,766 --> 00:36:10,065
- Just like in the drama, - That's right.

1015
00:36:10,066 --> 00:36:11,165
you earn well and give back to society.

1016
00:36:11,166 --> 00:36:12,965
We show kindness to others.

1017
00:36:12,966 --> 00:36:14,265
There are seedless...

1018
00:36:14,266 --> 00:36:15,766
- ripe persimmons.
-  I see.

1019
00:36:16,006 --> 00:36:17,135
Please have some.

1020
00:36:17,136 --> 00:36:18,606
- Seedless ripe persimmons?
-  Thank you.

1021
00:36:18,636 --> 00:36:21,106
(Even generously providing dessert!)

1022
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:22,845
Giving back is indeed cool.

1023
00:36:22,846 --> 00:36:24,346
We bought them with the leftover money.

1024
00:36:25,076 --> 00:36:27,016
- We still have some left.
-  Exactly.

1025
00:36:27,286 --> 00:36:28,416
Team Taek.

1026
00:36:29,046 --> 00:36:32,386
Please choose a member, Jae Myung.

1027
00:36:32,516 --> 00:36:33,825
- A member you think...
-  Yes?

1028
00:36:33,826 --> 00:36:35,756
will do a decent job.

1029
00:36:35,886 --> 00:36:37,255
- I...
-  Honestly,

1030
00:36:37,256 --> 00:36:39,095
- as long as I'm not with him, - keep avoiding my dad.

1031
00:36:39,096 --> 00:36:40,495
I'm totally fine.

1032
00:36:40,496 --> 00:36:42,065
I simply have to be away from him.

1033
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:44,436
I found out earlier that he was the weak link.

1034
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:48,136
- Is your son that bad?
-  Did we just gain a weak link?

1035
00:36:48,766 --> 00:36:50,135
You'll find out once you watch the show.

1036
00:36:50,136 --> 00:36:52,006
Wait, is Bo Gum bad at games?

1037
00:36:52,876 --> 00:36:55,075
Moo Sung, Sun Young, he, and I...

1038
00:36:55,076 --> 00:36:56,946
- are all a mess.
-  The weak links.

1039
00:36:57,146 --> 00:36:59,075
- I thought I was good at games.
-  But the prize is a big one.

1040
00:36:59,076 --> 00:37:00,885
- Really?
-  I'll do my best.

1041
00:37:00,886 --> 00:37:02,846
- Your best?
-  Bo Gum will do his best.

1042
00:37:03,086 --> 00:37:04,485
- Is there a prize?
-  The prize.

1043
00:37:04,486 --> 00:37:05,816
- Yes.
-  We do have a prize.

1044
00:37:06,186 --> 00:37:08,086
- Gold?
-  When it comes to family...

1045
00:37:08,186 --> 00:37:09,585
and holiday gatherings,

1046
00:37:09,586 --> 00:37:11,496
- food is the best, right?
-  Yes.

1047
00:37:11,956 --> 00:37:13,295
To the family that comes in...

1048
00:37:13,296 --> 00:37:14,666
first place in Family Entertainment...

1049
00:37:15,226 --> 00:37:16,395
What is Gangwon Province famous for?

1050
00:37:16,396 --> 00:37:18,336
- Hoengseong Korean beef.
-  Hoengseong Korean beef.

1051
00:37:18,696 --> 00:37:20,606
(Giving out a Hoengseong Korean beef set)

1052
00:37:20,766 --> 00:37:22,306
Nice.

1053
00:37:22,966 --> 00:37:24,276
It looks delicious.

1054
00:37:25,206 --> 00:37:27,006
(Only provided to the final winner)

1055
00:37:28,046 --> 00:37:31,246
(The finest Korean beef set with an assortment of cuts)

1056
00:37:31,546 --> 00:37:34,186
Each member gets a set.

1057
00:37:34,386 --> 00:37:36,145
(Unbelievable.)

1058
00:37:36,146 --> 00:37:37,956
You can take one home tomorrow morning.

1059
00:37:39,186 --> 00:37:40,625
You've watched "Family Entertainment" before, yes?

1060
00:37:40,626 --> 00:37:41,686
- Yes.
-  Yes.

1061
00:37:41,756 --> 00:37:44,525
We'll stick to the original version from back then...

1062
00:37:44,526 --> 00:37:46,966
and play some classic games.

1063
00:37:47,866 --> 00:37:49,026
"Games?"

1064
00:37:49,596 --> 00:37:50,766
How many have you planned?

1065
00:37:51,896 --> 00:37:54,206
We'll do quite a few until we get enough footage.

1066
00:37:54,436 --> 00:37:55,566
- Oh, dear.
-  No way.

1067
00:37:56,206 --> 00:37:58,176
(In pain)

1068
00:37:58,476 --> 00:38:01,006
- Not bad, right?
-  It sounds fun.

1069
00:38:02,146 --> 00:38:04,175
(One word from the eldest daughter, and the vibe changes.)

1070
00:38:04,176 --> 00:38:06,345
- The Icon of Optimism.
-  The Icon of Optimism.

1071
00:38:06,346 --> 00:38:08,345
- I'm loving it.
-  You've changed so much.

1072
00:38:08,346 --> 00:38:09,416
I'm really excited.

1073
00:38:09,816 --> 00:38:11,615
You raised your eldest daughter well.

1074
00:38:11,616 --> 00:38:12,786
(Succeeded in raising good children)

1075
00:38:13,016 --> 00:38:15,585
All right, let's begin Ssangmun-dong Family Entertainment.

1076
00:38:15,586 --> 00:38:17,056
(It begins now!)

1077
00:38:17,196 --> 00:38:20,126
(Let's go.)

1078
00:38:21,566 --> 00:38:25,796
(Ssangmun-dong Family Entertainment, Game Introduction)

1079
00:38:27,206 --> 00:38:28,565
(Game Information, First Game: Speed Quiz)

1080
00:38:28,566 --> 00:38:31,276
(Second Game: Unknown, The scores will be added up!)

1081
00:38:31,436 --> 00:38:33,805
I will reveal the first game.

1082
00:38:33,806 --> 00:38:35,006
The first game is...

1083
00:38:35,206 --> 00:38:37,215
a classic game that you may have seen...

1084
00:38:37,216 --> 00:38:38,346
on television.

1085
00:38:38,876 --> 00:38:40,386
Speed Quiz.

1086
00:38:40,686 --> 00:38:41,786
"Speed Quiz?"

1087
00:38:45,216 --> 00:38:46,686
(After seeing the keyword,)

1088
00:38:46,926 --> 00:38:49,925
(one family member will explain,)

1089
00:38:49,926 --> 00:38:51,795
(while the other four guess the answer.)

1090
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:54,366
(If they get it right, they will change the player!)

1091
00:38:54,596 --> 00:38:55,995
You explain with your mouth,

1092
00:38:55,996 --> 00:38:59,065
but you can't say what is in the keyword.

1093
00:38:59,066 --> 00:39:00,265
For example,

1094
00:39:00,266 --> 00:39:01,535
if it's "jjajangmyeon,"

1095
00:39:01,536 --> 00:39:03,976
- "It's jjajang." - you can't say that it's noodles.

1096
00:39:04,306 --> 00:39:06,105
"The one you eat like a pasta dish."

1097
00:39:06,106 --> 00:39:07,245
(You need to put it differently like that!)

1098
00:39:07,246 --> 00:39:09,506
Then, who will go first?

1099
00:39:10,006 --> 00:39:11,376
- Should I go first?
-  Okay.

1100
00:39:11,746 --> 00:39:13,316
- Us.
-  Us.

1101
00:39:13,616 --> 00:39:15,485
- Yes.
-  Will you go first?

1102
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:16,616
Are you okay?

1103
00:39:16,786 --> 00:39:18,116
She's full of enthusiasm.

1104
00:39:18,616 --> 00:39:20,355
(And...)

1105
00:39:20,356 --> 00:39:22,626
(The 3 drawing pads are laid in front of them.)

1106
00:39:22,726 --> 00:39:24,696
Just so you know, the categories are...

1107
00:39:24,926 --> 00:39:27,265
food, places, and people.

1108
00:39:27,266 --> 00:39:29,395
- "Places?" - Food must be the easiest.

1109
00:39:29,396 --> 00:39:30,596
People will be hard.

1110
00:39:30,736 --> 00:39:32,566
We are in trouble if it turn out to be people.

1111
00:39:32,696 --> 00:39:33,735
For me,

1112
00:39:33,736 --> 00:39:36,035
I'm usually okay with the first one.

1113
00:39:36,036 --> 00:39:37,535
That's good. Let's go with number one.

1114
00:39:37,536 --> 00:39:38,735
- Number one.
-  Number one.

1115
00:39:38,736 --> 00:39:40,075
- Will you go with number one?
-  Yes.

1116
00:39:40,076 --> 00:39:41,345
- Then we will bring out...
-  Yes.

1117
00:39:41,346 --> 00:39:42,946
Deok Sun's family.

1118
00:39:44,676 --> 00:39:45,945
- You go, Deok Sun.
-  The four of you come out,

1119
00:39:45,946 --> 00:39:48,286
and the one who will go first will stand here.

1120
00:39:48,346 --> 00:39:49,485
Let's do a chant.

1121
00:39:49,486 --> 00:39:50,955
- "Sung family, let's go." - The one we did.

1122
00:39:50,956 --> 00:39:52,556
- What was it?
-  "Sung family, let's go."

1123
00:39:52,786 --> 00:39:53,825
One, two, three.

1124
00:39:53,826 --> 00:39:55,826
- Sung family, let's go.
-  Sung family, let's go.

1125
00:39:55,856 --> 00:39:58,026
(Positive energy)

1126
00:39:58,426 --> 00:39:59,955
It's three minutes.

1127
00:39:59,956 --> 00:40:00,996
- Three minutes?
-  Per person?

1128
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:03,026
There are 15 questions.

1129
00:40:03,536 --> 00:40:04,865
Get ready...

1130
00:40:04,866 --> 00:40:05,896
(How will the Sung family's Speed Quiz skills be?)

1131
00:40:05,996 --> 00:40:07,206
Start.

1132
00:40:07,636 --> 00:40:08,706
Start.

1133
00:40:11,436 --> 00:40:13,376
- What is this?
-  Come on.

1134
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,410
Start.

1135
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,240
(Well, it is in the food category, for sure...)

1136
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,009
- What is this?
-  Come on.

1137
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:23,519
- It must not be food.
-  Time is ticking.

1138
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,750
I think it's like that.

1139
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:26,279
(Deok Sun never tried it...)

1140
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,719
I think it's like that. I think it's something fried.

1141
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,719
- It's food?
-  Yes.

1142
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,260
- Fried dumplings.
-  No.

1143
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:34,629
Outside, it's...

1144
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:35,929
- Rain? Pajeon.
-  Pajeon.

1145
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:36,959
Wait, no.

1146
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,159
- What's happening outside?
-  Rain.

1147
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,360
- It's raining.
-  And?

1148
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,729
- Gosh, this is driving me crazy.
-  It's raining.

1149
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:43,229
Just pass it, kid!

1150
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:44,299
Pass.

1151
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,569
- What is this?
-  Pass it?

1152
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:46,700
- Do they move on?
-  It's hard.

1153
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,470
(Fish and chips)

1154
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,809
Wait, this is an iconic dish of the UK.

1155
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:52,139
Good, that's nice.

1156
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:54,249
- Chips and fish.
-  The UK.

1157
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:55,710
- Fish and chips.
-  Yes.

1158
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,749
- Fish and chips.
-  Yes.

1159
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:58,880
- That's good.
-  Is that the answer?

1160
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:02,190
(Guobaorou)

1161
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:03,620
A Chinese...

1162
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,189
- traditional dish.
-  Hot pot.

1163
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:06,359
- No.
-  Jjajangmyeon.

1164
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,529
- No.
-  Malatang.

1165
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:08,630
Tangsuyuk.

1166
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:10,959
Tangsuyuk.

1167
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,299
- That's right.
-  Similar to that?

1168
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,629
- I know what that is.
-  Yes.

1169
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:14,930
- Guobaorou.
-  Correct.

1170
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,600
(It is finally the dad's turn.)

1171
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:19,240
Good.

1172
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:20,570
(Chuckling)

1173
00:41:20,571 --> 00:41:21,909
That's the thing...

1174
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:23,839
that I loved the most in the show.

1175
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,109
- Cockle.
-  Cockle salad.

1176
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:26,440
Do you eat them as they are?

1177
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:29,280
- You need to do something.
-  Rice.

1178
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:30,849
Fried egg.

1179
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:32,319
With soy sauce and all that.

1180
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,189
- Soy sauce marinated crab.
-  It's getting more confusing.

1181
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:35,549
- What do you need to add?
-  Cockle.

1182
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:37,259
What do you add to the cockles?

1183
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:38,989
- Seasonings.
-  Seasonings.

1184
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:40,159
That's it.

1185
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,590
- Seasoned cockle.
-  Correct.

1186
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:43,900
- "What do you add?" - Seasoned cockle.

1187
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,459
- Hye Ri is good.
-  She's good.

1188
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:47,870
(French toast)

1189
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:49,600
They eat this in the morning in the United States.

1190
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,440
- Breakfast.
-  American breakfast.

1191
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:52,639
No.

1192
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,709
- Sandwich, - It's sweet.

1193
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:55,309
- Scrambled eggs.
-  It's sweet.

1194
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:56,409
- No.
-  Toast.

1195
00:41:56,410 --> 00:41:57,580
That one.

1196
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:58,879
- Pancake.
-  Omelette.

1197
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,110
- He's like a shotgun.
-  Pancake.

1198
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:02,910
You are so bad.

1199
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:04,779
You put egg wash on it and fry it in the pan.

1200
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:06,479
- Sunny side up.
-  French toast.

1201
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,620
- Correct.
-  That's it.

1202
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:08,919
(Oh, that's it.)

1203
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,460
(The mom is happy after getting the answer.)

1204
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:12,419
(It is Deok Sun's turn again.)

1205
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:13,420
(Blade-end fatback)

1206
00:42:13,421 --> 00:42:14,660
(Screaming)

1207
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:16,290
(It's another hard question.)

1208
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:17,629
- Just pass it!
-  It's a cut of meat.

1209
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:18,929
(He can see how she will end up.)

1210
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:20,729
It's a cut of meat that you grill.

1211
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:22,270
- A cut of beef.
-  Bulgogi.

1212
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,299
- Skirt meat.
-  No, a cut of meat.

1213
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:25,869
- Not that one.
-  Top blade. Thin skirt.

1214
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:27,169
- Thin skirt.
-  Is it pork?

1215
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:28,510
- Sirloin.
-  Pork belly.

1216
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:30,169
- Pork jowl.
-  No.

1217
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:31,210
It's a good cut.

1218
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,779
- It's a special cut.
-  Pork skirt meat.

1219
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:34,910
- It's special.
-  Short rib.

1220
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:36,449
- Leftover meat.
-  Maybe it's not special?

1221
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:37,550
I don't know.

1222
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:39,549
(Acting cute)

1223
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:40,619
- Pass.
-  Pass.

1224
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:41,620
(Deok Sun passes 2 in a row.)

1225
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:43,219
(The older sister is here to fix her mess.)

1226
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:44,520
(Japchae)

1227
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:45,959
You eat this during the holidays.

1228
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,029
- Songpyeon.
-  Jeon.

1229
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:48,459
You eat this during the holidays,

1230
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:49,530
and it's noodles.

1231
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:52,260
- Janchi guksu.
-  You eat this during the holidays,

1232
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:54,429
and it's a stir-fried...

1233
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:55,430
- Japchae.
-  Japchae.

1234
00:42:55,431 --> 00:42:56,470
Correct.

1235
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,770
(She handles a hudred tasks of the family.)

1236
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:00,100
(Gnocchi)

1237
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:02,539
(What?)

1238
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:04,509
- How will you do that?
-  Just pass if you're not confident.

1239
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:05,580
- Pass.
-  No, don't.

1240
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:07,810
(They are all sloppy except for the oldest daughter.)

1241
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:09,810
What is "gnocchi?"

1242
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:11,219
- It's like potato cakes.
-  Potatotes.

1243
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:13,319
(Difficulties are expected.)

1244
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,920
(Curry udon)

1245
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:16,219
Yellow food of India.

1246
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:17,260
- Curry.
-  Curry.

1247
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:19,659
- Naan.
-  In our country,

1248
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:21,060
what is the thick noodles?

1249
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:22,290
With a clear broth.

1250
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:23,899
- Kalguksu.
-  Yes!

1251
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:25,430
No, not noodles.

1252
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:27,269
Curry noodles.

1253
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:28,529
- Garakguksu?
-  No.

1254
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:29,999
The thick one. It's simple.

1255
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,200
Garaetteok.

1256
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:32,699
It's curry something.

1257
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:34,310
- Ten, nine...
-  Curry fried noodles.

1258
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:37,409
(His wife and kids have no idea.)

1259
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:38,709
- Six, - Curry noodles.

1260
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:40,040
- five, four, - No, it's just curry, and...

1261
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:41,349
- four, - Not noodles.

1262
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:42,680
- three, two, - Curry udon.

1263
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:43,950
- one.
-  Curry udon.

1264
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:45,319
Correct.

1265
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,549
(The husband and wife truly are in sync!)

1266
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:48,050
- That's it.
-  The end.

1267
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:50,990
That was hard.

1268
00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:52,490
Gosh, this is hard.

1269
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,489
- In the beginning...
-  "Blade-end fatback?"

1270
00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:56,129
What is beef cutlet?

1271
00:43:56,130 --> 00:43:57,260
- Beef cutlet.
-  Hey.

1272
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:58,800
Hey, sit down.

1273
00:43:58,930 --> 00:44:00,030
Do we have some left?

1274
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,729
Why are you sitting down?

1275
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:02,829
- Go back in.
-  Come here.

1276
00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:04,139
- Go on in.
-  Go back in.

1277
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:05,400
- Go back in.
-  Is that so?

1278
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:07,439
- It's over.
-  But...

1279
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,570
- Let's do this.
-  Go on.

1280
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:09,910
Go on, sir.

1281
00:44:09,911 --> 00:44:12,110
Let's not allow two passes in a row.

1282
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:13,950
- Why?
-  All of a sudden?

1283
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:15,950
- You already did that.
-  I mean...

1284
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:17,780
- I'm sorry.
-  Let's not do that anymore.

1285
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,180
Let's go in.

1286
00:44:19,350 --> 00:44:20,449
What is wrong with you?

1287
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:22,719
No way.

1288
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:23,789
Gosh, you.

1289
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:24,819
(They end the situation with a couple's skit.)

1290
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:25,989
He's working the hardest...

1291
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:27,160
when he said he didn't want to play.

1292
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:29,829
But the funny thing was,

1293
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:31,759
Deok Sun acted like she was going to be the best,

1294
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,629
- but she got zero points.
-  I know.

1295
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:35,030
- Deok Sun got zero points.
-  It was hard.

1296
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:36,899
Deok Sun got the hard ones.

1297
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:38,439
- She kept passing.
-  Yes, they were hard.

1298
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:40,069
(Ssangmun-dong is still full of humanity.)

1299
00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:42,069
- What is beef cutlet?
-  They were hard.

1300
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:43,109
What is a beef cutlet?

1301
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:44,139
- Who can explain?
-  I don't know.

1302
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:46,010
Hey, pork cutlets...

1303
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:48,580
are made with pork.

1304
00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:50,110
Beef cutlets...

1305
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:52,480
- are made with beef.
-  Is that so?

1306
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,749
- They exist.
-  It's like a pork cutlet.

1307
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:56,550
- You'd only know if you'd tried it.
-  We...

1308
00:44:56,590 --> 00:44:58,889
I never fed them that.

1309
00:44:58,890 --> 00:45:00,020
I'm sorry.

1310
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:02,090
We never had the chance to try it.

1311
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:06,830
(Forget beef cutlets.)

1312
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:10,000
(They only ate greens at Deok Sun's house.)

1313
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:12,270
(On the other hand...)

1314
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:13,710
Would you like to order?

1315
00:45:14,370 --> 00:45:16,210
The beef cutlet is our specialty.

1316
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:18,410
(Jung Bong's family went to eat fancy food, like beef cutlets.)

1317
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:21,950
(Yummy)

1318
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:24,880
Our family can have a nice meal out together like this.

1319
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:27,590
There's no other family...

1320
00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:30,120
that can match how close-knit we are.

1321
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,359
- They never tried it.
-  I never tried it.

1322
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:33,990
I never fed them that.

1323
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:35,959
How many did we get?

1324
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:37,830
The score is...

1325
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:41,069
at 60 points for Deok Sun's family.

1326
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:42,499
- You did well.
-  It's not bad.

1327
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:43,899
- Did we get six?
-  Yes, six.

1328
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:45,640
- You did well.
-  I have a question.

1329
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:47,039
When explaining "beef cutlet,"

1330
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,609
can we say, "Not pork cutlets."

1331
00:45:48,610 --> 00:45:49,769
You can't say "cutlet."

1332
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:51,380
Right? You can't do that.

1333
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,150
He knew that.

1334
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:57,549
You can't say, "It is a cutlet?"

1335
00:45:57,550 --> 00:45:58,580
No.

1336
00:45:58,650 --> 00:45:59,650
See?

1337
00:45:59,651 --> 00:46:01,850
But if they mentioned "cutlet,"

1338
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:04,790
can they say, "What kind of cutlet?"

1339
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:06,419
Rather than that,

1340
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:08,189
why not say "gas?"

1341
00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:09,389
- Yes, you can say that.
-  No.

1342
00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:11,959
If they mentioned "cutlet" while explaining.

1343
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:13,360
Then it's okay.

1344
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:15,270
Dong Hwi, what is possible?

1345
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:17,339
If the people sitting...

1346
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:18,399
- "Cutlet" is...
-  If they said it?

1347
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,669
He says it's okay if they mentioned "cutlet."

1348
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:21,270
- If the people sitting...
-  From that side?

1349
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:22,909
Hey, is this game...

1350
00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:24,480
supposed to be this complicated?

1351
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:27,479
- It's okay if they mentioned it.
-  It's really confusing.

1352
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:28,480
You can say it if they mentioned it.

1353
00:46:28,481 --> 00:46:29,749
Director, I'm sorry,

1354
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:31,050
but I think I'm going to lose my voice.

1355
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:32,520
(Stop now.)

1356
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:35,249
Next, which team will play?

1357
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:36,690
Yes, we will go.

1358
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:38,360
Team Taek.

1359
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:40,660
Team Taek, please choose one.

1360
00:46:41,230 --> 00:46:42,390
- Choose one.
-  What should we do, Mom?

1361
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:43,999
This is really important.

1362
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,730
One is places, and what is the other one?

1363
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,100
I really don't know people's names.

1364
00:46:48,370 --> 00:46:49,529
- It's okay. Anything's fine.
-  Number two.

1365
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:51,099
- Number 2.
-  Number 2?

1366
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:53,670
Bo Gum, do you like places or people?

1367
00:46:54,870 --> 00:46:56,510
I don't really like either.

1368
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:57,840
(Laughing)

1369
00:46:58,540 --> 00:46:59,679
Still,

1370
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,179
try explaining a place.

1371
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:02,750
- Place.
-  Think of something in your head.

1372
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:04,449
(For Taek, who is strained...)

1373
00:47:04,450 --> 00:47:05,880
Where Sejong the Great...

1374
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:07,150
Where Sejong the Great...

1375
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:09,590
has his statue.

1376
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:11,319
- Gwanghwamun Square.
-  Gwanghwamun Square.

1377
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:12,320
Was that right?

1378
00:47:12,321 --> 00:47:14,060
- Try doing a person.
-  A person?

1379
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:15,360
A person?

1380
00:47:16,330 --> 00:47:17,460
A person?

1381
00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:19,730
He's going to cry.

1382
00:47:19,830 --> 00:47:21,870
- Do you not want to play?
-  Don't make him cry.

1383
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:24,169
Please give him some courage.

1384
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:25,999
- We can do it.
-  Yes.

1385
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,069
- Yes.
-  We can.

1386
00:47:27,070 --> 00:47:30,140
I'm not worried about him. I'm worried about us.

1387
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:31,710
You can do it. You can do it, right?

1388
00:47:32,210 --> 00:47:34,979
Doesn't this team have any kind of chant?

1389
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:36,409
- You should make one now.
-  We should...

1390
00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:37,519
(Thinking)

1391
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:38,550
Sun Taek.

1392
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:40,949
It's supposed to be Deok Sun and Taek, but we have Sun Woo.

1393
00:47:40,950 --> 00:47:42,489
- That's mine.
-  Okay, Sun Taek.

1394
00:47:42,490 --> 00:47:44,390
That's mine.

1395
00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:45,659
One, two, three.

1396
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:47,390
- Sun Taek, let's go.
-  Sun Taek, let's go.

1397
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,060
Good luck, in-laws.

1398
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:50,430
- In-laws.
-  My son-in-law.

1399
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:52,160
Get ready.

1400
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:53,560
Let's go.

1401
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:55,399
- Set...
-  I can't look back, right?

1402
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:57,569
- Hey.
-  You didn't tell us.

1403
00:47:57,570 --> 00:47:58,769
"I can't look back, right?"

1404
00:47:58,770 --> 00:48:00,710
- Right from the start?
-  Come on.

1405
00:48:00,770 --> 00:48:01,840
I'm dizzy.

1406
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:04,940
Get ready, set, start.

1407
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:07,780
(They got Brazil Tteokbokki of the location category.)

1408
00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:10,110
(Brazil Tteokbokki is a favorite store for Ssangmun-dong students.)

1409
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:13,349
Do you know which country says, "Obrigado?"

1410
00:48:13,350 --> 00:48:14,519
(A fresh approach)

1411
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:16,150
- You're going to do it like that?
-  Obrigado.

1412
00:48:16,350 --> 00:48:17,959
They have a green and yellow flag.

1413
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:19,419
- Brazil.
-  And...

1414
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:20,560
Finland?

1415
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:24,300
Do you know the place where Deok Sun and I always ate at?

1416
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:26,159
Korean street food.

1417
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,329
- France.
-  Korean street food.

1418
00:48:28,330 --> 00:48:29,969
- The most iconic one.
-  Korean street food? Restaurant.

1419
00:48:29,970 --> 00:48:31,899
- The most iconic street food.
-  My heart aches.

1420
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:33,539
- Gimbap Heaven.
-  No.

1421
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:34,769
In the show?

1422
00:48:34,770 --> 00:48:35,969
No, don't think of that.

1423
00:48:35,970 --> 00:48:39,810
In the show, the most iconic Korean street food made with rice cakes.

1424
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:41,010
Tteokbokki.

1425
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:44,079
What? You can't do that. Out.

1426
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:45,520
(The rule enforcer of Ssangmun-dong is tough.)

1427
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:47,219
No, he can. Say that it's right.

1428
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:48,589
- It's right.
-  Yes, it's right.

1429
00:48:48,590 --> 00:48:50,819
Then, if you add the flag with that?

1430
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:52,060
- Brazil Tteokbokki.
-  Yes.

1431
00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:55,130
- That was good.
-  This was how you explained it?

1432
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:57,829
(Wonhyo Bridge)

1433
00:48:57,830 --> 00:48:59,829
- What is that?
-  This was a Buddhist monk in Korea.

1434
00:48:59,830 --> 00:49:02,229
He ate the skull.

1435
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:04,339
- Wonhyo. Wonhyo Bridge.
-  He didn't eat the skull.

1436
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:06,099
- That's it.
-  Wonhyo Bridge.

1437
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:07,170
- Correct.
-  Gosh.

1438
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:10,139
How did you do that?

1439
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:11,840
(DDP)

1440
00:49:12,110 --> 00:49:13,639
These aren't the letters,

1441
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:16,549
so say the abbreviation of Dongdaemun Design Plaza.

1442
00:49:16,550 --> 00:49:18,080
- DDP.
-  Correct.

1443
00:49:18,350 --> 00:49:19,419
- What?
-  That was good.

1444
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:21,189
- He's good.
-  That was good.

1445
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:22,190
(It is the old man's turn again.)

1446
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:23,990
(Daecheon Beach)

1447
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:25,590
It's a beach, right?

1448
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,690
It's a famous beach in Chungcheong Province.

1449
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:31,299
- In Chungcheong Province?
-  A famous beach in Chungcheong.

1450
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:33,559
- Daecheon...
-  The beach.

1451
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:35,199
Is it Daecheonpo?

1452
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,969
- No, Daecheon Beach.
-  It is.

1453
00:49:36,970 --> 00:49:38,740
- That's right.
-  Correct.

1454
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,070
You're so good.

1455
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:42,709
- That was good.
-  You're so good.

1456
00:49:42,710 --> 00:49:44,309
(The National Museum of Korea)

1457
00:49:44,310 --> 00:49:47,379
This is the biggest place in our country,

1458
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:50,180
- with artifacts.
-  National Park.

1459
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:53,079
Bulguksa. No, Gyeongbokgung Palace. No, what is it?

1460
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:55,919
- That place in Gyeongju.
-  National Museum.

1461
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,589
- National...
-  Cemetery.

1462
00:49:57,590 --> 00:49:59,559
- National... Someone said "museum." - Art Museum.

1463
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:01,129
- Modern and Contemporary Art.
-  What comes after that?

1464
00:50:01,130 --> 00:50:03,230
- The National Museum of Korea.
-  That's it.

1465
00:50:03,590 --> 00:50:05,859
- Isn't that too easy?
-  It's okay if they said it.

1466
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:06,860
They said it.

1467
00:50:06,861 --> 00:50:07,870
(He understood the rules 120 percent.)

1468
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:09,999
- Hurry up and do it.
-  Wait.

1469
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,939
(Gampo Noodle Restaurant: Dong Ryong's restaurant)

1470
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:14,970
This is where you eat naengmyeon.

1471
00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:16,669
What comes to mind when you think of autumn?

1472
00:50:16,670 --> 00:50:17,710
Pyongyang naengmyeon.

1473
00:50:18,110 --> 00:50:19,510
- Yes.
-  That is right, but...

1474
00:50:19,910 --> 00:50:20,910
- Hamhung naengmyeon?
-  No.

1475
00:50:20,911 --> 00:50:22,679
- I don't know what that is.
-  Bibim naengmyeon?

1476
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:23,809
Pass it if you don't know.

1477
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:24,850
Sashimi naengmyeon?

1478
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:27,350
What is the naengmyeon that you eat in the fall?

1479
00:50:27,450 --> 00:50:28,889
I'll pass.

1480
00:50:28,890 --> 00:50:30,219
What kind of naengmyeon was it?

1481
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:31,690
You need to sit here.

1482
00:50:31,790 --> 00:50:34,159
That place where we hid...

1483
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,329
during the protest.

1484
00:50:35,330 --> 00:50:36,330
During the protest?

1485
00:50:37,930 --> 00:50:40,199
The protesters all hid in here.

1486
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,269
And the priests blocked it for them.

1487
00:50:42,270 --> 00:50:43,600
- Myeongdong Catholic Cathedral.
-  Yes.

1488
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,099
- Let's go.
-  Myeongdong Catholic Cathedral?

1489
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:46,640
(The parents are doing way better than the kids!)

1490
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:48,369
- What?
-  Gosh, this is...

1491
00:50:48,370 --> 00:50:49,710
- Is that how you explained it?
-  Gosh.

1492
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:52,279
Take it easy.

1493
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:53,810
- Pass. I can't do that.
-  Okay.

1494
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:55,209
I don't know.

1495
00:50:55,210 --> 00:50:56,749
In Yangpyeong...

1496
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:58,419
It's the next one.

1497
00:50:58,420 --> 00:50:59,450
(Gyeongdong Market, this one.)

1498
00:50:59,650 --> 00:51:00,749
Now...

1499
00:51:00,750 --> 00:51:01,890
(Father)

1500
00:51:01,990 --> 00:51:04,459
You can buy vegetables and meat here.

1501
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:05,619
- The market.
-  You have ten seconds left.

1502
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:07,530
- It's in...
-  Ten, nine...

1503
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:09,190
- Gangbuk.
-  Eight.

1504
00:51:09,430 --> 00:51:10,690
- Pyeonghwa Market.
-  Seven.

1505
00:51:11,230 --> 00:51:12,299
- Pyeonghwa Market.
-  Six.

1506
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:13,300
- Is it the name of the market?
-  Five.

1507
00:51:13,301 --> 00:51:14,400
It's famous for medicinal herbs.

1508
00:51:14,430 --> 00:51:15,469
- Four.
-  Wait...

1509
00:51:15,470 --> 00:51:16,599
- Gyeongdong Market.
-  Okay.

1510
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:17,640
- Correct.
-  Gyeongdong Market.

1511
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:18,999
- This is it.
-  You're good.

1512
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,269
I got one.

1513
00:51:20,270 --> 00:51:22,770
- Now...
-  Gyeongdong Market.

1514
00:51:22,870 --> 00:51:24,479
- I have an objection.
-  You did so well.

1515
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:25,709
Wait a minute.

1516
00:51:25,710 --> 00:51:27,179
Sung Kyun has an objection.

1517
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:28,510
- I have an objection.
-  What is it?

1518
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:30,149
- Back there, - He has an objection.

1519
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:31,519
When they were doing Brazil Tteokbokki,

1520
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,079
he said it was made with tteok.

1521
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:34,819
- That's right.
-  Does that count?

1522
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:36,589
- And with National Museum of Korea, - Does that count?

1523
00:51:36,590 --> 00:51:38,789
- We said "National Museum." - he said "in the middle."

1524
00:51:38,790 --> 00:51:40,259
- Hey.
-  I object.

1525
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:42,429
- We mentioned tteokbokki first.
-  Look here.

1526
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:44,259
- Yes?
-  You object first.

1527
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:45,999
Let's do it one by one.

1528
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,699
- One by one. Be clear.
-  Okay.

1529
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:50,330
Yes, during "Brazil Tteokbokki,"

1530
00:51:50,470 --> 00:51:52,269
he said it was made with tteok,

1531
00:51:52,270 --> 00:51:53,969
and he mentioned the word "tteok."

1532
00:51:53,970 --> 00:51:55,909
- That's not right.
-  He's right. And...

1533
00:51:55,910 --> 00:51:58,140
with "the National Museum of Korea,"

1534
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,709
- he said "in the middle," - The middle.

1535
00:51:59,710 --> 00:52:01,309
and mentioned "of."

1536
00:52:01,310 --> 00:52:03,109
But with "the National Museum of Korea,"

1537
00:52:03,110 --> 00:52:05,319
it just has the same sound...

1538
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:07,719
as "in the middle," but it has a different meaning.

1539
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:08,889
- I knew it.
-  Correct.

1540
00:52:08,890 --> 00:52:10,149
- That was a wise assessment.
-  You are correct.

1541
00:52:10,150 --> 00:52:11,320
I knew it.

1542
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:12,720
- But...
-  "But?"

1543
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:14,790
- With "Brazil Tteokbokki," - Yes.

1544
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:17,759
I will ask the conscience of the era.

1545
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,759
The one who was in charge of the question.

1546
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,100
- You're right.
-  Let's do that.

1547
00:52:21,270 --> 00:52:22,700
- That one is for sure.
-  Be confident.

1548
00:52:22,770 --> 00:52:24,469
- I've never seen...
-  Yes, Bo Gum.

1549
00:52:24,470 --> 00:52:25,539
- Bo Gum lie.
-  Yes.

1550
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:26,699
He will never lie.

1551
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:28,170
- Bo Gum doesn't lie.
-  That's right.

1552
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:29,670
- Bo Gum.
-  Yes?

1553
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:31,680
When you were doing "Brazil Tteokbokki,"

1554
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:34,209
was there any foul play?

1555
00:52:34,210 --> 00:52:35,880
There was no foul play.

1556
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:37,620
- Yes.
-  Because...

1557
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:39,519
I said that it was the most iconic street food of Korea,

1558
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,619
and she said, "Gimbap Heaven."

1559
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:42,819
So after that,

1560
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:44,719
I said that it's the most iconic street food made with tteok...

1561
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,219
- No way!
-  See?

1562
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:48,689
- Hey! What's wrong with you?
-  We got him.

1563
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:50,229
- We got him.
-  Get him.

1564
00:52:50,230 --> 00:52:52,599
Why did you say that?

1565
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:54,229
- Arrest complete.
-  Seriously.

1566
00:52:54,230 --> 00:52:55,329
Arrest complete.

1567
00:52:55,330 --> 00:52:57,669
- He is such an honest person.
-  Yes.

1568
00:52:57,670 --> 00:52:59,000
He will not lie.

1569
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:01,210
Gosh.

1570
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:03,469
He has an incredible conscience.

1571
00:53:03,470 --> 00:53:05,640
- His conscience...
-  The conscience of the era.

1572
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:08,249
(Shy)

1573
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:09,309
Goodness.

1574
00:53:09,310 --> 00:53:10,609
We still got at least seven words right.

1575
00:53:10,610 --> 00:53:13,249
I will announce the score.

1576
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:14,450
We have three left.

1577
00:53:14,590 --> 00:53:16,849
The initial score was 70,

1578
00:53:16,850 --> 00:53:19,360
but since "Brazil Tteokbokki" was marked as incorrect,

1579
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:20,860
it will be 60 points.

1580
00:53:21,530 --> 00:53:22,960
- It will be 60 points.
-  We need to give them demerits.

1581
00:53:23,230 --> 00:53:25,599
- That needs to be given demerits.
-  "Demerits?"

1582
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,569
- "Demerits?" - We need to give them demerits.

1583
00:53:27,570 --> 00:53:30,570
- We need to get seven.
-  That was foul play.

1584
00:53:32,570 --> 00:53:34,239
He keeps changing the rules.

1585
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:35,240
I know. What's wrong with you?

1586
00:53:35,241 --> 00:53:36,870
You keep changing it.

1587
00:53:37,010 --> 00:53:40,180
I'm sorry, but your scores are not that different, so it's okay.

1588
00:53:40,810 --> 00:53:41,879
Okay.

1589
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:43,710
Lastly, Jung Bong's family.

1590
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:45,719
- Let's go.
-  It's Jung Bong's family.

1591
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:47,380
(The last family to play is Jung Bong's.)

1592
00:53:47,550 --> 00:53:49,050
I can't wait for this team.

1593
00:53:49,490 --> 00:53:51,220
What was our chant?

1594
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:53,690
"Hoengseong Korean beef, let's go."

1595
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:56,090
- Hoengseong Korean beef, let's go.
-  Hoengseong Korean beef, let's go.

1596
00:53:56,830 --> 00:53:59,530
(Will Jung Bong's family surpass the tricky 60 points?)

1597
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:01,470
We will begin.

1598
00:54:01,630 --> 00:54:03,670
It is 3 minutes with 15 questions. Get ready,

1599
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:07,470
set, start.

1600
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:10,910
This is a hip-hop artist.

1601
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:12,279
He has really big ears.

1602
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:13,340
CO KUN.

1603
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:15,079
- Make it longer.
-  CODE KUNST

1604
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:16,109
- Correct.
-  Correct.

1605
00:54:16,110 --> 00:54:17,510
Hurry up and go.

1606
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:18,649
Hurry up and give it.

1607
00:54:18,650 --> 00:54:19,880
(Shin Won Ho)

1608
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,590
Our...

1609
00:54:23,250 --> 00:54:25,120
- Well...
-  What?

1610
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:26,960
You're not Jung Bong.

1611
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:30,129
Jung Bong, slow down. You're overexcited.

1612
00:54:30,130 --> 00:54:31,429
Slow down.

1613
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:33,500
- He can't focus.
-  He has come with us,

1614
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:34,769
but he is not here.

1615
00:54:34,770 --> 00:54:35,770
- Shin Won Ho.
-  Shin...

1616
00:54:35,771 --> 00:54:36,870
- Correct.
-  Correct.

1617
00:54:37,130 --> 00:54:38,299
(He got the answer with Dong Il's coaching!)

1618
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:39,300
Good job.

1619
00:54:39,301 --> 00:54:40,340
(Proud)

1620
00:54:40,370 --> 00:54:41,709
(Yun Soo Il)

1621
00:54:41,710 --> 00:54:42,940
Gosh, pass.

1622
00:54:43,010 --> 00:54:44,280
- What?
-  Like that?

1623
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:47,380
(Park Jeong Min)

1624
00:54:47,610 --> 00:54:49,079
He's not that good.

1625
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:50,710
This person was in our show.

1626
00:54:51,350 --> 00:54:52,580
Bo Ra's...

1627
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:53,949
Park Jeong Min.

1628
00:54:53,950 --> 00:54:55,519
- Correct.
-  Hurry up.

1629
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:56,819
(Park Jeong Min appeared as Bo Ra's ex-boyfriend.)

1630
00:54:56,820 --> 00:54:58,560
- They have it too easy.
-  Hurry up.

1631
00:54:59,190 --> 00:55:00,320
Pass.

1632
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:01,830
(Quick self-assessment)

1633
00:55:02,190 --> 00:55:03,330
(Kim Seol)

1634
00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:04,799
(It is Hesitant Jung Bong's turn again.)

1635
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:07,930
- Slow down.
-  It's one of our cast members,

1636
00:55:08,530 --> 00:55:11,039
- but she is not here.
-  Seol. Kim Seol.

1637
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,070
- Correct.
-  Amazing.

1638
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:14,710
- That's too easy.
-  Hurry up.

1639
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:16,709
- What? Wait.
-  Do it.

1640
00:55:16,710 --> 00:55:18,279
- It's a foreign actor, - Yes?

1641
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:19,680
and she's very beautiful,

1642
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:21,609
and...

1643
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:23,109
- Julia Roberts.
-  Sophie Marceau.

1644
00:55:23,110 --> 00:55:24,550
- Sophie Marceau.
-  Correct.

1645
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,250
- Hurry up.
-  They are in first place.

1646
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:28,249
- We only need 1 or 2 more.
-  Hurry up.

1647
00:55:28,250 --> 00:55:29,550
- This is...
-  Let's go.

1648
00:55:29,850 --> 00:55:30,920
I don't know her.

1649
00:55:31,890 --> 00:55:33,389
Go on.

1650
00:55:33,390 --> 00:55:34,560
(Mark Zuckerberg)

1651
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:36,330
He's a genius.

1652
00:55:36,430 --> 00:55:37,630
"He's a genius?"

1653
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:39,100
Pass.

1654
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:41,130
- You can do it.
-  Come on.

1655
00:55:41,430 --> 00:55:42,500
(Park Nam Jung)

1656
00:55:43,430 --> 00:55:44,470
Park Nam Jung.

1657
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,870
- Okay.
-  Correct.

1658
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:48,040
(Beyonce)

1659
00:55:48,041 --> 00:55:50,169
- Well...
-  Let's go.

1660
00:55:50,170 --> 00:55:52,609
- You can do it.
-  It's a female singer.

1661
00:55:52,610 --> 00:55:54,450
She's the symbol of sexiness.

1662
00:55:54,550 --> 00:55:56,050
- Beyonce.
-  Correct.

1663
00:55:56,510 --> 00:55:59,719
It's the chef of Mosu.

1664
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:01,250
- Anh Sung Jae.
-  Anh Sung Jae.

1665
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:02,720
(Freddie Mercury)

1666
00:56:03,190 --> 00:56:04,990
This became a movie.

1667
00:56:05,290 --> 00:56:06,489
He's a famous singer.

1668
00:56:06,490 --> 00:56:07,490
You can sing the song.

1669
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:10,160
- Freddie Mercury.
-  Correct.

1670
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,399
Do you know that?

1671
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,230
He has a toothpick like this.

1672
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,429
- Leslie Cheung.
-  Chow Yun Fat.

1673
00:56:16,430 --> 00:56:17,670
- Correct.
-  That's it.

1674
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:19,200
They are so good.

1675
00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:21,170
(But...)

1676
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:24,039
The ones from before. The ones that they passed.

1677
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:26,139
There were too many passes, so that's it for the questions.

1678
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:27,310
Go to the front.

1679
00:56:27,850 --> 00:56:29,110
(They go back to the ones that they passed.)

1680
00:56:29,210 --> 00:56:30,849
The original singer of "Apartment."

1681
00:56:30,850 --> 00:56:32,350
- Yun Soo Il.
-  Correct.

1682
00:56:32,850 --> 00:56:34,649
(Jung Bong's final drive)

1683
00:56:34,650 --> 00:56:35,689
Okay.

1684
00:56:35,690 --> 00:56:36,819
(Tchaikovsky)

1685
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:39,590
- He's looking for it.
-  The icon of probiotics.

1686
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:41,020
What?

1687
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:42,760
Helicobacter.

1688
00:56:43,230 --> 00:56:45,700
- No, wait.
-  Lee Gyeong Gyu.

1689
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:47,100
What?

1690
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:48,429
- Kim Sung Kyun - That's not it.

1691
00:56:48,430 --> 00:56:49,499
Kim Sung Kyun.

1692
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:50,770
- Again.
-  I completely...

1693
00:56:50,970 --> 00:56:53,269
- I completely...
-  Kim Sung Kyun.

1694
00:56:53,270 --> 00:56:55,409
- I was completely off.
-  Again.

1695
00:56:55,410 --> 00:56:56,969
- I was stupid. But...
-  Again.

1696
00:56:56,970 --> 00:56:59,479
It's a similar kind of name.

1697
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:01,079
"Probiotics?"

1698
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:02,649
- Did you confuse it?
-  Ten, nine,

1699
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:04,080
- "The Swan Lake." - eight,

1700
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:06,349
seven, six,

1701
00:57:06,350 --> 00:57:08,520
- The one who spins?
-  five, four,

1702
00:57:09,150 --> 00:57:12,090
- three, two, one.
-  Is it Esther Park?

1703
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:14,060
- There must be a song like that.
-  The end.

1704
00:57:14,190 --> 00:57:15,559
- That's it.
-  What was that probiotic one?

1705
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:16,960
"The icon of probiotics?"

1706
00:57:17,290 --> 00:57:19,500
Hey, what does Tchaikovsky have anything to do with...

1707
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,870
Why did you think like that?

1708
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:23,729
What is he saying?

1709
00:57:23,730 --> 00:57:25,939
How did you connect Helicobacter and Tchaikovsky?

1710
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:27,040
- I hae no idea.
-  Come on.

1711
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:28,170
- You know what?
-  I was confused.

1712
00:57:28,370 --> 00:57:29,439
This was given again.

1713
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:30,740
I could have gotten this one.

1714
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:33,040
Tchaikovsky is known for probiotics.

1715
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:35,950
They're in first place.

1716
00:57:36,310 --> 00:57:38,050
I think we got a lot right.

1717
00:57:38,650 --> 00:57:41,120
There were some tough moments along the way,

1718
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:43,319
but you got 11 questions right. Nice work.

1719
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:44,560
(Since they got 11 questions right, they get 110 points.)

1720
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:46,259
Hoengseong Korean beef!

1721
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:48,059
(Jung Bong's family is a symbol of wealth and good fortune.)

1722
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:49,229
- I...
-  It's not over yet.

1723
00:57:49,230 --> 00:57:50,289
I'm sorry, Dad.

1724
00:57:50,290 --> 00:57:51,529
- I'm sorry.
-  It's all right.

1725
00:57:51,530 --> 00:57:52,560
I'm sorry, Dad.

1726
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:54,130
It's not over until it's over.

1727
00:57:55,130 --> 00:57:56,630
It's not over until it's over.

1728
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:58,740
We only finished one game.

1729
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:00,669
So far, you have 60 points,

1730
00:58:00,670 --> 00:58:03,410
110 points, and 60 points.

1731
00:58:03,510 --> 00:58:06,010
There's still plenty of time to turn things around.

1732
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:07,480
Shall we continue right away?

1733
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:10,149
For the actors' well-being,

1734
00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:11,279
let's not play too many games.

1735
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:12,980
Jae Myung says he's really dizzy right now.

1736
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:15,289
(The professional game player)

1737
00:58:15,290 --> 00:58:17,319
This last one...

1738
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:20,389
will swing the scores massively...

1739
00:58:20,390 --> 00:58:22,230
because it...

1740
00:58:22,390 --> 00:58:23,590
includes point deductions.

1741
00:58:24,230 --> 00:58:25,359
Goodness.

1742
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:26,730
They do whatever they want.

1743
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,429
This game is...

1744
00:58:30,430 --> 00:58:32,269
the Music Scholarship Quiz.

1745
00:58:32,270 --> 00:58:33,270
(The second game is the Music Scholarship Quiz.)

1746
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:35,209
(A classic and legendary quiz show meets music.)

1747
00:58:35,210 --> 00:58:36,309
Music Scholarship Quiz?

1748
00:58:36,310 --> 00:58:37,840
(A classic and legendary quiz show meets music.)

1749
00:58:38,110 --> 00:58:40,080
I'm really not sure about this.

1750
00:58:40,580 --> 00:58:42,709
- Our family won't be good at this.
-  Right.

1751
00:58:42,710 --> 00:58:46,520
(In "Reply 1988," Deok Sun's family often watched "Scholarship Quiz.")

1752
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:48,749
(Deok Sun's living room)

1753
00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:51,089
I have a wish.

1754
00:58:51,090 --> 00:58:52,489
What is it, Dad? Tell me.

1755
00:58:52,490 --> 00:58:53,689
I'll make it come true, no matter what.

1756
00:58:53,690 --> 00:58:55,290
I want you to enter that.

1757
00:58:56,030 --> 00:58:57,289
Scholarship Quiz.

1758
00:58:57,290 --> 00:58:59,229
I don't care even if you get everything wrong.

1759
00:58:59,230 --> 00:59:01,299
Just seeing you standing there...

1760
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:02,600
would be enough for me.

1761
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:04,870
I'm sorry, Dad.

1762
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,070
Why?

1763
00:59:06,270 --> 00:59:08,040
I don't think I can make that wish come true.

1764
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:11,580
(This is what Deok Sun said at the time.)

1765
00:59:11,710 --> 00:59:13,480
(Coming up: Scholarship Quiz)

1766
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:15,150
You only loved me

1767
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:21,590
(Mr. Sung, Deok Sun will be appearing on Scholarship Quiz.)

1768
00:59:23,090 --> 00:59:24,820
(Stay tuned)

1769
00:59:25,090 --> 00:59:26,159
(They're still buzzing about the game reveal.)

1770
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:27,660
- Music Scholarship Quiz?
-  You listen to music the most.

1771
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:29,859
So they play a song,

1772
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:31,030
and we guess the title?

1773
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:32,500
I don't know many songs.

1774
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:35,370
Songs. I'm in trouble.

1775
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:37,299
Dong Hwi's good at this.

1776
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:39,000
You listen to music a lot.

1777
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:40,140
Me?

1778
00:59:40,870 --> 00:59:42,869
You probably listen to the most music out of all of us.

1779
00:59:42,870 --> 00:59:44,309
- I don't know K-pop songs.
-  Scholarship Quiz.

1780
00:59:44,310 --> 00:59:45,310
Me neither.

1781
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:47,980
Are they old or recent songs?

1782
00:59:48,010 --> 00:59:49,879
Some of you know songs that are more recent.

1783
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:52,120
Some of you know songs that are older.

1784
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:53,420
So you get to choose.

1785
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:56,250
All right. We'll show you...

1786
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:58,420
the scoreboard for the quiz.

1787
00:59:58,490 --> 01:00:00,259
(The scoreboard is revealed.)

1788
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:01,429
Take a look.

1789
01:00:01,430 --> 01:00:04,030
(Category, points)

1790
01:00:04,090 --> 01:00:06,130
Are those 10 points, 20 points, 30 points, and 40 points?

1791
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:07,560
- Yes.
-  So, they show the difficulty.

1792
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:09,430
Higher points mean a higher level of difficulty, right?

1793
01:00:09,870 --> 01:00:10,969
(Obviously)

1794
01:00:10,970 --> 01:00:12,069
Of course.

1795
01:00:12,070 --> 01:00:13,640
Songs from the 80s and 90s.

1796
01:00:13,970 --> 01:00:15,670
Movie original soundtracks.

1797
01:00:15,770 --> 01:00:17,209
Show theme music?

1798
01:00:17,210 --> 01:00:18,840
- Show theme music?
-  What's "show theme music?"

1799
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:21,079
You listen to the music...

1800
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:24,180
and guess which show it was the theme music of.

1801
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:26,619
You have to guess the name of the show.

1802
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:28,150
(They have to guess the titles of the movies and TV shows.)

1803
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:30,019
We have to guess who the artist is too?

1804
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:31,559
This is too difficult.

1805
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:32,720
(For others, they have to guess both the song title and artist.)

1806
01:00:32,860 --> 01:00:36,390
Let's say I choose the 30-point song from the 80s and 90s.

1807
01:00:37,030 --> 01:00:39,300
We'll show you the keyword for that 30-point song.

1808
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:41,729
If we're wrong, do we lose 30 points?

1809
01:00:41,730 --> 01:00:42,870
- Are we guessing the titles?
-  That's right.

1810
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:44,129
- Gosh.
-  If we're wrong?

1811
01:00:44,130 --> 01:00:45,699
(The correct answer gets 30 points. The wrong answer loses 30 points.)

1812
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:47,200
(This is how the game will go.)

1813
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:49,170
Each team will send out one player.

1814
01:00:49,310 --> 01:00:51,680
The 3 players will be given 4 questions.

1815
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:55,380
(Each round consists of 4 questions and 3 players.)

1816
01:00:55,450 --> 01:00:57,179
Once we go through the four questions,

1817
01:00:57,180 --> 01:00:58,349
we'll get a new set of players for the next round.

1818
01:00:58,350 --> 01:00:59,379
So everyone...

1819
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:02,620
will be playing at least once.

1820
01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:05,190
(After 5 rounds and 20 questions, the final scores will be tallied.)

1821
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:06,789
You can now discuss...

1822
01:01:06,790 --> 01:01:08,990
who will be starting off for your teams.

1823
01:01:09,090 --> 01:01:10,830
(Team Deok Sun)

1824
01:01:10,860 --> 01:01:11,899
Do you want to go?

1825
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:13,400
I don't know anything about songs.

1826
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:14,500
I don't have a TV at home.

1827
01:01:14,670 --> 01:01:17,670
Let's see who the other teams choose.

1828
01:01:17,970 --> 01:01:20,870
(Team Deok Sun is trying to choose based on the other teams' players.)

1829
01:01:21,270 --> 01:01:22,669
(Team Taek and Sun Woo)

1830
01:01:22,670 --> 01:01:24,340
What are they talking about?

1831
01:01:25,410 --> 01:01:26,910
We should discuss too.

1832
01:01:27,010 --> 01:01:28,309
What do we have to discuss?

1833
01:01:28,310 --> 01:01:29,750
What categories are we the most confident about?

1834
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:31,009
We should...

1835
01:01:31,010 --> 01:01:32,879
go for movies and the 80s and 90s.

1836
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:34,549
The two of you go for the 2000s and the present.

1837
01:01:34,550 --> 01:01:35,589
I don't know anything about popular music.

1838
01:01:35,590 --> 01:01:38,660
I think the show theme music will be easy up to 30 points.

1839
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:40,090
They'll be very familiar.

1840
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:41,890
Who wants to go first?

1841
01:01:41,930 --> 01:01:42,990
Jae Hong, you should do it.

1842
01:01:43,030 --> 01:01:44,289
I did it earlier.

1843
01:01:44,290 --> 01:01:45,460
I actually don't understand the game.

1844
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:47,760
I'm sorry, Dong Hwi,

1845
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:49,270
but I'm going to have to watch you play first.

1846
01:01:49,630 --> 01:01:52,099
We can't tell what's what right now,

1847
01:01:52,100 --> 01:01:54,000
so I'll go first.

1848
01:01:54,100 --> 01:01:55,309
(Sung Kyun steps forward for Jung Bong.)

1849
01:01:55,310 --> 01:01:57,139
- We should...
-  Awesome.

1850
01:01:57,140 --> 01:01:58,639
Kim Sung Kyun, you're awesome.

1851
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:00,139
(Deok Sun's dad steps up as well.)

1852
01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:03,309
- Go, Dad!
-  Go, Dad!

1853
01:02:03,310 --> 01:02:06,620
(The cheering match for the two dads is intensifying.)

1854
01:02:06,750 --> 01:02:08,550
(Taek?)

1855
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:11,820
(This team saw the dads step up.)

1856
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:13,190
Bo Gum!

1857
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:15,160
(Targeting their weak point)

1858
01:02:15,730 --> 01:02:18,830
(Youngblood Bo Gum was rushed in.)

1859
01:02:21,130 --> 01:02:22,969
I want to know...

1860
01:02:22,970 --> 01:02:25,039
what your strategies are.

1861
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:26,839
- We don't have a strategy.
-  My team explicitly told me...

1862
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:27,970
that I'm a throwaway card.

1863
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:30,009
(A card with no second chance)

1864
01:02:30,010 --> 01:02:32,739
At first, they have to see how the game goes.

1865
01:02:32,740 --> 01:02:34,009
So that's why they chose me.

1866
01:02:34,010 --> 01:02:35,079
(The same reason)

1867
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:36,409
Then is Bo Gum a throwaway card too?

1868
01:02:36,410 --> 01:02:38,009
- No.
-  No, he's our ace.

1869
01:02:38,010 --> 01:02:40,080
- We're going to win.
-  The others are throwaway cards.

1870
01:02:40,220 --> 01:02:41,789
- No, he's our winning card.
-  No.

1871
01:02:41,790 --> 01:02:43,389
- He's our ace.
-  We're going to win.

1872
01:02:43,390 --> 01:02:44,820
- The others are throwaway cards.
-  We're seizing the upper hand.

1873
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:46,059
- No, he's our winning card.
-  We're seizing the upper hand.

1874
01:02:46,060 --> 01:02:47,560
(Too much pressure)

1875
01:02:47,820 --> 01:02:50,360
(Deok Sun approaches her dad.)

1876
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:52,060
You have to win the rock-paper-scissors...

1877
01:02:52,460 --> 01:02:55,230
- and choose the 80s and 90s.
-  Okay.

1878
01:02:55,270 --> 01:02:56,370
(Got it.)

1879
01:02:57,300 --> 01:02:58,640
Dad, we can lose points in this game.

1880
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:00,270
We can lose points in this game.

1881
01:03:01,870 --> 01:03:03,469
I'm sorry,

1882
01:03:03,470 --> 01:03:04,939
but maybe you should send out someone else.

1883
01:03:04,940 --> 01:03:06,209
Be prudent.

1884
01:03:06,210 --> 01:03:08,210
Dad, don't worry about losing points.

1885
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:10,050
What are you...

1886
01:03:10,780 --> 01:03:12,649
- Do whatever you want.
-  You're being too optimistic.

1887
01:03:12,650 --> 01:03:14,080
- Hye Young!
-  Aren't you being too optimistic?

1888
01:03:14,450 --> 01:03:16,389
What do you think your chants are?

1889
01:03:16,390 --> 01:03:17,550
Team Deok Sun.

1890
01:03:17,650 --> 01:03:18,689
- Team Jung Bong.
-  Team Jung Bong.

1891
01:03:18,690 --> 01:03:20,060
- Team Taek.
-  Okay.

1892
01:03:20,660 --> 01:03:21,760
Those will be your chants.

1893
01:03:21,790 --> 01:03:23,459
And if you're correct, you receive points.

1894
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:26,460
And if you're wrong, you get points deducted.

1895
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:28,499
- Do we play rock-paper-scissors?
-  Yes.

1896
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:30,229
- The winner chooses the question?
-  That's right.

1897
01:03:30,230 --> 01:03:31,429
After that,

1898
01:03:31,430 --> 01:03:33,069
- the person who was correct.
-  The person who was correct...

1899
01:03:33,070 --> 01:03:34,700
will choose the next question.

1900
01:03:34,910 --> 01:03:36,110
Okay.

1901
01:03:36,140 --> 01:03:37,839
Shouldn't the ace go first, then?

1902
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:39,840
No, you already sent someone out. You can't switch players.

1903
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:41,179
(What?)

1904
01:03:41,180 --> 01:03:42,379
We all have to go at least once anyway.

1905
01:03:42,380 --> 01:03:43,449
Hey!

1906
01:03:43,450 --> 01:03:45,250
We all have to go at least once anyway.

1907
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:48,150
Let's just quickly play rock-paper-scissors!

1908
01:03:48,250 --> 01:03:50,150
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors!
-  Rock-paper-scissors!

1909
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:51,350
- Rock-paper-scissors!
-  Rock-paper-scissors!

1910
01:03:51,590 --> 01:03:52,890
(Dong Il wins.)

1911
01:03:53,020 --> 01:03:54,659
(They all stand up and cheer.)

1912
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:55,859
He didn't get the answer right yet.

1913
01:03:55,860 --> 01:03:57,330
He didn't get the answer right yet.

1914
01:03:57,590 --> 01:03:59,529
Both in "Reply 1988..."

1915
01:03:59,530 --> 01:04:01,300
and earlier,

1916
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:02,700
we all showed our worst moments.

1917
01:04:02,930 --> 01:04:04,029
That is why...

1918
01:04:04,030 --> 01:04:05,199
we're choosing...

1919
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:06,500
the 50-point question of the 80s and 90s.

1920
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:09,140
(Cheering)

1921
01:04:09,470 --> 01:04:10,509
Let's go!

1922
01:04:10,510 --> 01:04:13,210
Revealing the 50-point question of the 80s and 90s.

1923
01:04:13,710 --> 01:04:15,510
The hint is "backwards word."

1924
01:04:15,650 --> 01:04:17,879
It's the keyword. That's your clue.

1925
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:19,719
We'll play the song now.

1926
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:20,780
Play the song.

1927
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:22,050
Goodness.

1928
01:04:23,990 --> 01:04:25,120
This is...

1929
01:04:25,420 --> 01:04:26,519
Team Jung Bong!

1930
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:28,660
(Already?)

1931
01:04:28,930 --> 01:04:29,959
- It's long.
-  What's the answer?

1932
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:31,560
- The singer is Kang San Eh.
-  Kang San Eh.

1933
01:04:32,060 --> 01:04:33,659
"Like the Energetic Salmons..."

1934
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:35,229
"That Travel..."

1935
01:04:35,230 --> 01:04:36,399
"Upriver."

1936
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:38,600
- Wait. Repeat that.
-  He was right.

1937
01:04:38,670 --> 01:04:40,269
You got one word wrong.

1938
01:04:40,270 --> 01:04:41,739
(Wrong! He got the singer right.)

1939
01:04:41,740 --> 01:04:43,609
(Yes!)

1940
01:04:43,610 --> 01:04:45,340
- You have to guess now.
-  Right. You got this.

1941
01:04:45,610 --> 01:04:46,639
- One syllable.
-  You have to guess correctly.

1942
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:47,679
He got one word wrong.

1943
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:49,379
- One word.
-  You can do this.

1944
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:50,380
- You got this.
-  You have to get it right.

1945
01:04:50,381 --> 01:04:51,509
Team Jung Bong!

1946
01:04:51,510 --> 01:04:52,679
He's tried already.

1947
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,119
You have to change one word.

1948
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:56,989
For 10 seconds, the other 2 get their chances.

1949
01:04:56,990 --> 01:04:58,259
- No, but...
-  Dad, you got this.

1950
01:04:58,260 --> 01:04:59,889
Give us a clue.

1951
01:04:59,890 --> 01:05:00,890
- Give us a clue.
-  But this is...

1952
01:05:01,090 --> 01:05:02,789
(No one but Sung Kyun has an idea about what the song is.)

1953
01:05:02,790 --> 01:05:04,230
But you have to understand that...

1954
01:05:04,290 --> 01:05:06,099
Nine, eight...

1955
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:07,900
(In the flowing river, swimming upstream)

1956
01:05:08,130 --> 01:05:09,769
(The opening line of the song is very striking.)

1957
01:05:09,770 --> 01:05:11,769
- Three, two, one.
-  Three, two, one.

1958
01:05:11,770 --> 01:05:13,700
- Team Jung Bong!
-  He's tried already.

1959
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,739
- It's been 10 seconds.
-  It's been 10 seconds.

1960
01:05:15,740 --> 01:05:16,840
Kang San Eh's

1961
01:05:16,940 --> 01:05:19,109
"Like the Energetic Salmons..."

1962
01:05:19,110 --> 01:05:21,310
- That Travel..." - That travel.

1963
01:05:21,410 --> 01:05:23,309
- "Upriver." - Upriver.

1964
01:05:23,310 --> 01:05:24,550
- Wrong!
-  What?

1965
01:05:24,850 --> 01:05:26,920
Do they lose 50 points, then?

1966
01:05:26,980 --> 01:05:28,789
They've lost 100 points so far.

1967
01:05:28,790 --> 01:05:30,319
- He went twice.
-  Should I stop?

1968
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:31,920
- They lost 100 points?
-  Should I stop?

1969
01:05:31,990 --> 01:05:33,159
We lost 100 points.

1970
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:34,290
We're in trouble.

1971
01:05:34,820 --> 01:05:37,490
Your attempt was 99.8 percent correct.

1972
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:39,460
But what I said was correct.

1973
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:41,360
- You were.
-  Then go again.

1974
01:05:41,430 --> 01:05:42,729
Go again.

1975
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:44,600
- Wait.
-  I was right.

1976
01:05:44,730 --> 01:05:46,999
You have to change one word. You're so close.

1977
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,239
(Revealing the one word)

1978
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:50,109
(Sung Kyun's first attempt)

1979
01:05:50,110 --> 01:05:54,239
("Like the Energetic Salmons That Travel Upriver")

1980
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:56,910
(The answer: "Like the Energetic Salmons That Travel Upstream")

1981
01:05:57,210 --> 01:05:59,380
You have to change one word.

1982
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:00,949
- Team Taek!
-  What?

1983
01:06:00,950 --> 01:06:02,519
(Team Taek and Sun Woo's first attempt)

1984
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:05,060
Kang San Eh's "Strong Salmons..."

1985
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:07,089
"Swimming..."

1986
01:06:07,090 --> 01:06:09,490
"Upriver."

1987
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:11,960
- Wrong!
-  Like! "Like Strong Salmon!"

1988
01:06:13,030 --> 01:06:14,399
- What's that?
-  So you...

1989
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:15,599
changed the word "travel," right?

1990
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:17,300
- You changed "travel?" - Yes. "Travel."

1991
01:06:17,670 --> 01:06:19,099
- Wrong!
-  We did that first.

1992
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:20,640
We already did that and got it wrong.

1993
01:06:21,070 --> 01:06:22,440
I'm just going to sit still.

1994
01:06:23,010 --> 01:06:24,240
Team Taek!

1995
01:06:24,470 --> 01:06:25,680
Team Taek!

1996
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:27,979
- You're losing points.
-  Again?

1997
01:06:27,980 --> 01:06:30,310
Just say which one you're changing.

1998
01:06:30,450 --> 01:06:31,580
- I'll take out "Up." - Up?

1999
01:06:32,180 --> 01:06:33,380
- I'll take out "Up." - Up?

2000
01:06:33,820 --> 01:06:35,219
- You're taking out "Up?" - The river.

2001
01:06:35,220 --> 01:06:36,849
- The river.
-  The river.

2002
01:06:36,850 --> 01:06:38,220
Wrong!

2003
01:06:38,860 --> 01:06:40,920
Taking out "Up" doesn't make sense!

2004
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:42,690
Listen!

2005
01:06:42,930 --> 01:06:45,229
(Moo Sung has achieved an empty mind.)

2006
01:06:45,230 --> 01:06:46,299
What is he saying?

2007
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:47,599
(Collapsed)

2008
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:48,770
What is he saying?

2009
01:06:49,370 --> 01:06:50,529
- All right.
-  He's going!

2010
01:06:50,530 --> 01:06:52,000
- Kang San Eh.
-  Kang San Eh.

2011
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:53,669
- "Like the Energetic..." - Like the Energetic.

2012
01:06:53,670 --> 01:06:54,899
- "Salmons..." - Salmons.

2013
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:56,169
- "That Travel..." - That Travel.

2014
01:06:56,170 --> 01:06:57,309
"Upstream."

2015
01:06:57,310 --> 01:06:58,410
Correct!

2016
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:01,309
(Finally, Yeong Seok shouts "Correct" for the first time.)

2017
01:07:01,310 --> 01:07:03,380
Bo Gum, you did your best.

2018
01:07:04,050 --> 01:07:06,080
(Bitter)

2019
01:07:06,180 --> 01:07:08,920
They lost 50 points.

2020
01:07:08,990 --> 01:07:10,419
How many turns did they go? Was it 4 or 5?

2021
01:07:10,420 --> 01:07:11,860
- They went 4 times.
-  They went 4 times.

2022
01:07:11,990 --> 01:07:13,290
So, what happens to us?

2023
01:07:13,790 --> 01:07:14,919
I got it wrong twice before I got it right.

2024
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:16,029
Let's not think about it.

2025
01:07:16,030 --> 01:07:17,030
Just focus on getting these next ones right.

2026
01:07:17,031 --> 01:07:18,929
The staff will be tallying the scores.

2027
01:07:18,930 --> 01:07:21,129
That's not important right now. Hold on.

2028
01:07:21,130 --> 01:07:23,870
- Why did he take out "Up?" - Why would he take out "Up?"

2029
01:07:24,170 --> 01:07:26,270
I mean... I was...

2030
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:29,509
(Even his teammates aren't standing up for him.)

2031
01:07:29,510 --> 01:07:31,569
I really wanted to ask too.

2032
01:07:31,570 --> 01:07:32,579
Park Bo Gum,

2033
01:07:32,580 --> 01:07:33,779
- the conscience of the era.
-  I just...

2034
01:07:33,780 --> 01:07:35,409
- Are you going through something?
-  No.

2035
01:07:35,410 --> 01:07:36,410
You're okay?

2036
01:07:36,411 --> 01:07:37,509
My brain wasn't functioning.

2037
01:07:37,510 --> 01:07:39,220
- Your brain. All right.
-  I'm sorry.

2038
01:07:39,450 --> 01:07:40,649
(Park Bo Gum)

2039
01:07:40,650 --> 01:07:42,390
(Park Bo Um)

2040
01:07:42,620 --> 01:07:44,189
I didn't think he'd take out "Up."

2041
01:07:44,190 --> 01:07:45,990
- Right.
-  Seriously.

2042
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:47,320
Sung Kyun.

2043
01:07:48,060 --> 01:07:49,089
You're amazing.

2044
01:07:49,090 --> 01:07:50,559
- You're amazing.
-  Unexpectedly,

2045
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:52,500
Kim Sung Kyun is in the lead.

2046
01:07:52,530 --> 01:07:53,829
He's amazing.

2047
01:07:53,830 --> 01:07:55,300
I know a lot of songs from the 80s and 90s.

2048
01:07:55,870 --> 01:07:57,930
(Sung Kyun keeps going for the 80s and 90s.)

2049
01:07:58,100 --> 01:08:00,700
The 40-point question of the 80s and 90s.

2050
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:01,869
(Again?)

2051
01:08:01,870 --> 01:08:03,270
He keeps choosing the tough ones.

2052
01:08:03,740 --> 01:08:05,010
That's a good strategy.

2053
01:08:05,180 --> 01:08:06,980
All right. We'll go with the 40-point one.

2054
01:08:07,210 --> 01:08:10,279
Your keyword is "needle."

2055
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:12,520
(The keyword for the 40-point question of the 80s and 90s: Needle)

2056
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:15,189
(You said you only loved me)

2057
01:08:15,190 --> 01:08:16,249
You're doing great!

2058
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:17,390
(You said you only loved me)

2059
01:08:17,950 --> 01:08:21,420
(KOYOTE's hit song is lifting everyone's spirits.)

2060
01:08:22,590 --> 01:08:23,830
You really don't know this song?

2061
01:08:24,460 --> 01:08:25,629
I know who the singer is.

2062
01:08:25,630 --> 01:08:26,730
You know who the singer is.

2063
01:08:27,430 --> 01:08:29,030
Team Jung Bong!

2064
01:08:29,570 --> 01:08:31,700
- The title is? Three, two...
-  "Broken Heart!"

2065
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:33,640
Correct!

2066
01:08:35,110 --> 01:08:37,610
(Team Jung Bong got 2 correct answers in a row.)

2067
01:08:37,810 --> 01:08:39,579
- Amazing!
-  What do needles...

2068
01:08:39,580 --> 01:08:40,709
have to do with a thread?

2069
01:08:40,710 --> 01:08:42,110
(Where a thread goes, a needle follows.)

2070
01:08:42,250 --> 01:08:43,909
(His next question of choice is...)

2071
01:08:43,910 --> 01:08:46,120
The 30-point question of the 80s and 90s.

2072
01:08:46,150 --> 01:08:48,049
The 30-point question of the 80s and 90s.

2073
01:08:48,050 --> 01:08:50,520
(He chose from the same category 3 times in a row.)

2074
01:08:50,690 --> 01:08:53,859
This means that when Moo Sung and Jae Myung...

2075
01:08:53,860 --> 01:08:55,230
take their turns later, they won't be able to guess.

2076
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:56,460
That's our strategy.

2077
01:08:56,830 --> 01:08:58,260
Reveal the keyword, please.

2078
01:08:58,860 --> 01:09:00,329
- Your clue is "mirror." - Mirror.

2079
01:09:00,330 --> 01:09:01,360
(The keyword for the 30-point question of the 80s and 90s: Mirror)

2080
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:03,969
(Compared to a rose)

2081
01:09:03,970 --> 01:09:05,070
You know this.

2082
01:09:07,170 --> 01:09:08,200
You know this.

2083
01:09:08,510 --> 01:09:10,069
- Team Jung Bong!
-  Wait!

2084
01:09:10,070 --> 01:09:11,140
Team Jung Bong!

2085
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:12,609
- Wait!
-  Team Jung Bong!

2086
01:09:12,610 --> 01:09:13,610
- Team Jung Bong!
-  Team Jung Bong!

2087
01:09:13,611 --> 01:09:16,150
(If he gets this right, he'll have 3 correct answers in a row.)

2088
01:09:16,750 --> 01:09:18,410
- Shin Seung Hun.
-  Shin Seung Hun.

2089
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:20,049
"Reflection of You in Your Smile."

2090
01:09:20,050 --> 01:09:21,050
Correct!

2091
01:09:23,190 --> 01:09:24,520
(Disappointed)

2092
01:09:24,890 --> 01:09:27,490
(Team Jung Bong got 3 correct answers in a row.)

2093
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:29,830
Dad! You're amazing!

2094
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:32,899
(I don't want to cry)

2095
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:36,370
(I want to laugh again)

2096
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:38,770
(Put your hand down if you want to cry.)

2097
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,600
Is listening to songs all you do?

2098
01:09:40,740 --> 01:09:42,269
- Gosh.
-  Amazing.

2099
01:09:42,270 --> 01:09:44,169
You're awesome. You're the ace.

2100
01:09:44,170 --> 01:09:45,280
Gosh.

2101
01:09:45,740 --> 01:09:48,310
Bo Gum. I feel bad for him.

2102
01:09:48,710 --> 01:09:49,909
Bo Gum, you got this.

2103
01:09:49,910 --> 01:09:51,680
- You can do this!
-  Bo Gum, you got this.

2104
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:53,520
I'm sorry, but Bo Gum, but did you have absolutely no clue?

2105
01:09:53,820 --> 01:09:55,149
No, I did know.

2106
01:09:55,150 --> 01:09:56,990
You knew what it was? This is an old song.

2107
01:09:57,050 --> 01:09:58,449
I knew it was Shin Seung Hun's song,

2108
01:09:58,450 --> 01:10:00,359
but I wasn't sure what the title was.

2109
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:02,929
- I didn't remember the title too.
-  It's long.

2110
01:10:02,930 --> 01:10:05,560
Bo Gum is letting...

2111
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:07,129
his seniors win.

2112
01:10:07,130 --> 01:10:08,999
He's so nice. He's definitely the conscience of the era.

2113
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,700
- Let's stop being nice.
-  Okay.

2114
01:10:12,100 --> 01:10:14,199
- The pressure.
-  All right.

2115
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:16,040
- Let's stop being nice.
-  Let's continue the game.

2116
01:10:16,210 --> 01:10:17,339
- Sung Kyun.
-  Again?

2117
01:10:17,340 --> 01:10:19,409
Yes. You already got all three questions right.

2118
01:10:19,410 --> 01:10:21,980
Let's do the 20-point and the 10-point questions.

2119
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:23,309
I'll choose from the 80s and 90s then.

2120
01:10:23,310 --> 01:10:25,220
- Good.
-  The 20-point question.

2121
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:26,519
(The 4th consecutive question from the 80s and 90s category.)

2122
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:27,979
- You're doing great.
-  The 80s and...

2123
01:10:27,980 --> 01:10:29,289
You're like a genius right now.

2124
01:10:29,290 --> 01:10:31,319
I'm sorry, but the way I see it,

2125
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:33,820
Jae Myung and Moo Sung won't have anything to do now.

2126
01:10:33,890 --> 01:10:35,159
(Only one question remains in the 80s and 90s category.)

2127
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:36,229
It's over.

2128
01:10:36,230 --> 01:10:37,260
(The 10-point question)

2129
01:10:37,930 --> 01:10:40,459
You never know. They might listen to recent songs.

2130
01:10:40,460 --> 01:10:41,599
And we still have the movie category.

2131
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:42,969
That's right. They can do the movie questions.

2132
01:10:42,970 --> 01:10:44,129
(The final keyword of Round 1)

2133
01:10:44,130 --> 01:10:45,870
- Rice?
-  Rice.

2134
01:10:46,340 --> 01:10:47,370
Really?

2135
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:48,609
I can't think of any title.

2136
01:10:48,610 --> 01:10:50,010
There are a few songs.

2137
01:10:50,310 --> 01:10:51,670
I don't know any.

2138
01:10:52,580 --> 01:10:55,110
(Tension is in the air.)

2139
01:10:55,350 --> 01:10:56,609
(A familiar tune starts playing.)

2140
01:10:56,610 --> 01:10:58,210
I know this.

2141
01:10:59,950 --> 01:11:01,679
(The crowd figured it out right away.)

2142
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:03,350
This is the final song in Round One.

2143
01:11:05,050 --> 01:11:06,459
(Honey)

2144
01:11:06,460 --> 01:11:08,160
(Don't you know this?)

2145
01:11:08,260 --> 01:11:09,429
Team Jung Bong!

2146
01:11:09,430 --> 01:11:11,059
- Team Jung Bong!
-  Goodness.

2147
01:11:11,060 --> 01:11:12,060
(Sung Kyun was the fastest again.)

2148
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:15,830
(Will he successfully dominate Round 1?)

2149
01:11:16,070 --> 01:11:17,770
- Kim Wan Sun.
-  Kim Wan Sun?

2150
01:11:17,830 --> 01:11:19,040
- Wrong! That's incorrect.
-  Wrong.

2151
01:11:19,300 --> 01:11:20,500
Wrong! That's incorrect.

2152
01:11:21,100 --> 01:11:22,410
- It's not her?
-  No, it's not.

2153
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:23,970
- Wrong.
-  It's not her.

2154
01:11:24,370 --> 01:11:25,410
It's not her.

2155
01:11:25,510 --> 01:11:27,339
(Who is the singer that the YB doesn't recognize?)

2156
01:11:27,340 --> 01:11:28,780
- It's not her.
-  We'll listen again.

2157
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:30,850
Is it Na Mi?

2158
01:11:31,410 --> 01:11:32,580
It's Na Mi!

2159
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:34,179
(The singer's name is Na Mi.)

2160
01:11:34,180 --> 01:11:35,450
It's not Kim Wan Sun.

2161
01:11:35,590 --> 01:11:37,020
It's not Kim Wan Sun.

2162
01:11:37,990 --> 01:11:41,119
(Then, what is the title of the song?)

2163
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:42,560
- I recognize the song.
-  Right.

2164
01:11:42,690 --> 01:11:44,689
(The song features electronic-based rhythms...)

2165
01:11:44,690 --> 01:11:46,700
(and Na Mi's distinctive straightforward vocal style.)

2166
01:11:47,060 --> 01:11:50,730
(This is Na Mi's hit song.)

2167
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:55,770
(My heart is like an Indian doll)

2168
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:58,510
(The song title: "Like an Indian Doll")

2169
01:11:58,740 --> 01:12:00,780
I can't think of the singer.

2170
01:12:02,510 --> 01:12:04,179
- She knows the song.
-  Hye Ri knows the song.

2171
01:12:04,180 --> 01:12:05,210
Hye Ri knows.

2172
01:12:05,580 --> 01:12:07,650
Tell me whatever you can think of.

2173
01:12:08,050 --> 01:12:09,519
Did you figure it out?

2174
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:11,650
- Is it...
-  The vibe is good.

2175
01:12:12,220 --> 01:12:13,260
Team Jung Bong!

2176
01:12:13,660 --> 01:12:14,660
Team Jung Bong.

2177
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:16,990
If I'm wrong, we're totally...

2178
01:12:17,190 --> 01:12:18,259
- Na Mi.
-  Na Mi!

2179
01:12:18,260 --> 01:12:19,330
Okay.

2180
01:12:19,430 --> 01:12:20,799
- "Pierrot Smiling at Us." - Goodness.

2181
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:22,000
- Wrong!
-  That's not it?

2182
01:12:22,070 --> 01:12:23,229
- "Pierrot Smiling at Us." - Goodness.

2183
01:12:23,230 --> 01:12:24,700
(Pierrot?)

2184
01:12:24,870 --> 01:12:27,000
Gosh, I can't believe he said pierrot.

2185
01:12:27,170 --> 01:12:29,310
(Sung Kyun wasn't able to steer away from Kim Wan Sun.)

2186
01:12:29,510 --> 01:12:30,909
- Na Mi!
-  Na Mi!

2187
01:12:30,910 --> 01:12:32,109
"Like an Indian Doll."

2188
01:12:32,110 --> 01:12:33,210
Correct!

2189
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:37,479
(Sung Kyun said "Pierrot,")

2190
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:39,780
(but the answer was "Indian.")

2191
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:42,420
(Happy, sad)

2192
01:12:43,250 --> 01:12:44,919
That's Kim Wan Sun's song.

2193
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:45,989
I got it confused.

2194
01:12:45,990 --> 01:12:46,990
You did well.

2195
01:12:47,190 --> 01:12:49,060
You did well.

2196
01:12:49,490 --> 01:12:52,229
- What is it?
-  "Like an Indian Doll."

2197
01:12:52,230 --> 01:12:53,500
He wouldn't know the song.

2198
01:12:54,330 --> 01:12:56,970
(Hye Ri continues her encore performance.)

2199
01:12:57,770 --> 01:12:59,669
Hye Ri, stop. Enough.

2200
01:12:59,670 --> 01:13:00,940
We have to continue with the game.

2201
01:13:01,470 --> 01:13:03,039
(Sung Deok Sun, the daughter of the person who answered correctly)

2202
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:04,470
Hye Ri, you're good.

2203
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:06,080
She's adorable.

2204
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:07,709
- Bo Gum.
-  Yes.

2205
01:13:07,710 --> 01:13:09,509
- Do you understand the game now?
-  Yes.

2206
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:10,909
This round is over. Return to your seats, please.

2207
01:13:10,910 --> 01:13:12,419
- It is?
-  Why?

2208
01:13:12,420 --> 01:13:14,150
I got one right!

2209
01:13:15,420 --> 01:13:17,389
- You didn't lose points, either.
-  I didn't lose points, either.

2210
01:13:17,390 --> 01:13:19,120
- You didn't lose points, either.
-  I didn't expect this.

2211
01:13:19,620 --> 01:13:20,860
I should have stayed quiet.

2212
01:13:21,020 --> 01:13:22,430
(Sung Kyun made many attempts, but only got 3 right.)

2213
01:13:22,590 --> 01:13:23,989
You still got a lot of them right.

2214
01:13:23,990 --> 01:13:25,729
- You still got a lot of them right.
-  I cost us a lot of points.

2215
01:13:25,730 --> 01:13:27,229
We shouldn't lose more points.

2216
01:13:27,230 --> 01:13:28,769
Let's strategize. What should we do?

2217
01:13:28,770 --> 01:13:30,899
- We've been doing great.
-  We don't need a strategy.

2218
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:33,200
If you don't know, stay quiet. If you're sure, say it.

2219
01:13:33,870 --> 01:13:35,570
(Kyung Pyo stood up.)

2220
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:37,609
Kyung Pyo stepped up.

2221
01:13:37,610 --> 01:13:39,210
- Yes.
-  I thought it was that.

2222
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:40,579
Do you want to go?

2223
01:13:40,580 --> 01:13:42,350
(Since Sun Woo's playing, will Bo Ra too?)

2224
01:13:43,650 --> 01:13:45,920
We're...

2225
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:47,449
Min Ji, do you want to go?

2226
01:13:47,450 --> 01:13:49,019
- Me?
-  You go, Min Ji.

2227
01:13:49,020 --> 01:13:50,389
(Team Jung Bong's 2nd player: Min Ji)

2228
01:13:50,390 --> 01:13:51,390
- She's a strong player.
-  Min Ji!

2229
01:13:51,391 --> 01:13:53,460
This round is between the youngbloods.

2230
01:13:53,620 --> 01:13:54,789
Let's go!

2231
01:13:54,790 --> 01:13:55,989
(Round 2: Hye Young versus Min Ji versus Kyung Pyo)

2232
01:13:55,990 --> 01:13:57,260
We have to play rock-paper-scissors.

2233
01:13:57,330 --> 01:13:59,899
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

2234
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:01,160
(Hye Young lost.)

2235
01:14:01,300 --> 01:14:02,300
That's fine.

2236
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,299
You're so optimistic.

2237
01:14:04,300 --> 01:14:05,369
- She's adorable.
-  What's fine?

2238
01:14:05,370 --> 01:14:07,570
- Choosing is more difficult for me.
-  I see.

2239
01:14:07,740 --> 01:14:08,940
Rock-paper-scissors.

2240
01:14:09,810 --> 01:14:11,139
All right, Kyung Pyo. Choose the question.

2241
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:12,810
The 50-point question of movie soundtracks.

2242
01:14:13,580 --> 01:14:14,779
(Kyung Pyo boldly starts off with the 50-point question.)

2243
01:14:14,780 --> 01:14:15,909
- He's a movie producer.
-  Really?

2244
01:14:15,910 --> 01:14:16,910
Impressive!

2245
01:14:16,911 --> 01:14:18,250
Let's get everything right.

2246
01:14:18,510 --> 01:14:19,649
(The keyword: 132 minutes)

2247
01:14:19,650 --> 01:14:20,850
What's 132 minutes?

2248
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:23,049
(The keyword for the 50-point movie soundtrack question: 132 minutes)

2249
01:14:23,050 --> 01:14:24,150
We'll know when we hear it.

2250
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:27,489
(Hye Young got into college in 2010 as a film major.)

2251
01:14:27,490 --> 01:14:29,359
- I think she knows.
-  What is this?

2252
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:30,389
(Min Ji got into college in 2007 as a theater and film major.)

2253
01:14:30,390 --> 01:14:32,530
- I know this one.
-  Are we guessing the movie title?

2254
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:34,329
(Kyung Pyo got into college in 2009 as a film major.)

2255
01:14:34,330 --> 01:14:35,600
Are you sure this isn't a TV drama?

2256
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:36,899
Min Ji, don't say anything.

2257
01:14:36,900 --> 01:14:39,840
(The 3 film majors are competing to guess the movie soundtrack.)

2258
01:14:41,540 --> 01:14:43,040
I feel like I know this.

2259
01:14:43,670 --> 01:14:45,139
Isn't this music from that show,

2260
01:14:45,140 --> 01:14:46,610
- "In-Depth 60 Minutes?" - I know.

2261
01:14:46,710 --> 01:14:48,109
Isn't this from the show "Sponge?"

2262
01:14:48,110 --> 01:14:49,150
"Sponge."

2263
01:14:49,550 --> 01:14:50,750
It is from "Sponge."

2264
01:14:51,810 --> 01:14:54,550
(Yes, the music was featured in "Sponge.")

2265
01:14:54,820 --> 01:14:56,789
- It was used a lot in "Sponge." - Yes.

2266
01:14:56,790 --> 01:15:00,459
But actually, a very famous Korean movie...

2267
01:15:00,460 --> 01:15:02,089
- Korea?
-  A Korean movie?

2268
01:15:02,090 --> 01:15:03,789
was where this music was first featured in.

2269
01:15:03,790 --> 01:15:04,889
- Korea?
-  A Korean movie?

2270
01:15:04,890 --> 01:15:07,160
You'd be considered a spy if you don't know this director.

2271
01:15:07,330 --> 01:15:08,429
- Really?
-  Who is it?

2272
01:15:08,430 --> 01:15:09,670
(A movie so iconic, not knowing it makes you seem like a spy)

2273
01:15:09,870 --> 01:15:10,929
"Memories of Murder."

2274
01:15:10,930 --> 01:15:12,900
("Memories of Murder")

2275
01:15:13,140 --> 01:15:14,739
I can't think of anything.

2276
01:15:14,740 --> 01:15:15,910
(This music was in Bong Joon Ho's "Memories of Murder?")

2277
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:18,610
(Listen carefully.)

2278
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:23,180
(It's the track that plays in the movie's opening scene.)

2279
01:15:23,910 --> 01:15:25,520
Can we get another clue?

2280
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:27,920
- The clue is Bong Joon Ho.
-  Hurry.

2281
01:15:28,180 --> 01:15:29,550
- Bong Joon Ho.
-  Hurry.

2282
01:15:29,820 --> 01:15:31,119
- Hurry.
-  Min Ji.

2283
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:32,459
- Hey.
-  Come on.

2284
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:34,319
- Min Ji!
-  Hye Young!

2285
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:36,989
(In contrast, the 3 film majors are quiet.)

2286
01:15:36,990 --> 01:15:38,259
- Min Ji, it's his most famous film.
-  Three, two...

2287
01:15:38,260 --> 01:15:39,329
- His most famous film.
-  Hurry.

2288
01:15:39,330 --> 01:15:40,659
Team Deok Sun!

2289
01:15:40,660 --> 01:15:41,960
- Your answer is?
-  "The Host."

2290
01:15:42,230 --> 01:15:43,930
- "The Host!" - Wrong!

2291
01:15:44,130 --> 01:15:45,429
- What else is there?
-  Team Jung Bong!

2292
01:15:45,430 --> 01:15:47,040
- Team Jung Bong!
-  Gosh.

2293
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:48,270
"Memories of Murder."

2294
01:15:49,370 --> 01:15:50,440
Correct!

2295
01:15:50,740 --> 01:15:51,869
I didn't think of "Memories of Murder."

2296
01:15:51,870 --> 01:15:54,110
- Gosh. Yes.
-  This was in "Memories of Murder?"

2297
01:15:54,610 --> 01:15:56,510
- It's okay. Things happen.
-  He could have gotten it.

2298
01:15:56,710 --> 01:15:59,080
Gosh, we were doing such a good job at not losing points.

2299
01:15:59,980 --> 01:16:01,650
(I'm sorry, Dad.)

2300
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:03,749
Min Ji is a film major too.

2301
01:16:03,750 --> 01:16:05,049
- Choose whatever you want.
-  Choose whatever you want.

2302
01:16:05,050 --> 01:16:06,690
(Film Major Min Ji chooses...)

2303
01:16:06,790 --> 01:16:09,930
The 30-point question of movie soundtracks.

2304
01:16:10,090 --> 01:16:11,559
The 30-point question of movie soundtracks.

2305
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:13,430
- That was difficult.
-  Nice.

2306
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:14,600
Team Jung Bong!

2307
01:16:14,601 --> 01:16:15,730
- Team Jung Bong.
-  "A Tale of Two Sisters."

2308
01:16:16,230 --> 01:16:17,230
Correct!

2309
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:18,800
It's "A Tale of Two Sisters?"

2310
01:16:19,340 --> 01:16:20,899
I thought it was "Welcome to Dongmakgol."

2311
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:22,509
- By Director Kim Jee Woon.
-  Right.

2312
01:16:22,510 --> 01:16:25,240
(The younger film majors are in despair.)

2313
01:16:28,380 --> 01:16:31,050
- Why was the clue rain?
-  I thought it was a Ghibli film.

2314
01:16:31,350 --> 01:16:33,420
- A Ghibli film?
-  You wear rain boots in the rain.

2315
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:35,420
Why was the clue rain?

2316
01:16:35,690 --> 01:16:37,450
You wear rain boots in the rain.

2317
01:16:38,350 --> 01:16:39,359
(I got it.)

2318
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:40,589
(Eureka!)

2319
01:16:40,590 --> 01:16:41,690
Unbelievable.

2320
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:43,490
The clues are confusing us more.

2321
01:16:44,090 --> 01:16:45,429
(The next clue is...)

2322
01:16:45,430 --> 01:16:47,029
- Don't rush.
-  Let's go!

2323
01:16:47,030 --> 01:16:48,199
All right.

2324
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:49,229
"The?"

2325
01:16:49,230 --> 01:16:50,269
(The keyword for the 40-point question of movie soundtracks: The)

2326
01:16:50,270 --> 01:16:52,029
That's even more confusing.

2327
01:16:52,030 --> 01:16:53,099
What's "The" for?

2328
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:54,769
I don't know. The clues are not helpful at all.

2329
01:16:54,770 --> 01:16:57,070
How is that a clue?

2330
01:16:58,070 --> 01:17:00,710
(Wait. "The?")

2331
01:17:01,580 --> 01:17:03,679
- Team Taek.
-  We have an attempt. Team Taek!

2332
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:05,350
- "The Good, the Bad, the Weird." - He got it.

2333
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:06,720
Correct!

2334
01:17:08,450 --> 01:17:10,219
(Screaming)

2335
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:11,920
- You finally did it.
-  Well done.

2336
01:17:12,220 --> 01:17:13,859
You did it!

2337
01:17:13,860 --> 01:17:15,889
"The" as in "The Good, the Bad, the Weird."

2338
01:17:15,890 --> 01:17:17,459
It's in front of each word.

2339
01:17:17,460 --> 01:17:18,489
(They realized now why "The" was the clue.)

2340
01:17:18,490 --> 01:17:19,629
"The."

2341
01:17:19,630 --> 01:17:20,759
What?

2342
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:22,199
(Speechless)

2343
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:23,200
This is how you give out the clues.

2344
01:17:23,201 --> 01:17:25,470
I think our team is good at movie soundtracks.

2345
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:28,169
So we'll keep that for later, and I'll do something else.

2346
01:17:28,170 --> 01:17:29,339
From the 2000s to the present.

2347
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:31,239
You're the only one who can work on the 2000s to the present.

2348
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:32,639
- Among the 3 of us left...
-  Try the 2000s to the present?

2349
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:33,710
- Yes.
-  From the 2000s to the present?

2350
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:34,909
Sun Young, sit down.

2351
01:17:34,910 --> 01:17:35,979
Sit on your chair.

2352
01:17:35,980 --> 01:17:37,209
(Oh, right.)

2353
01:17:37,210 --> 01:17:38,949
I'll try the 2000s to the present...

2354
01:17:38,950 --> 01:17:40,149
- for 50 points.
-  Gosh.

2355
01:17:40,150 --> 01:17:41,350
- For 50 points?
-  Yes.

2356
01:17:41,550 --> 01:17:42,890
- What?
-  Let's go.

2357
01:17:42,950 --> 01:17:44,520
That's also favorable for my daughter.

2358
01:17:44,990 --> 01:17:46,319
(The next keyword is...)

2359
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:47,360
(Hospital)

2360
01:17:47,490 --> 01:17:48,560
Hospital?

2361
01:17:48,690 --> 01:17:49,889
I think I know.

2362
01:17:49,890 --> 01:17:51,529
The keywords are strange.

2363
01:17:51,530 --> 01:17:52,960
The hint isn't simple.

2364
01:17:53,230 --> 01:17:54,260
Just answer it right away.

2365
01:17:55,330 --> 01:17:56,770
Wait. It's not that song.

2366
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:57,969
I know this song.

2367
01:17:57,970 --> 01:18:00,769
(The K-pop ghost)

2368
01:18:00,770 --> 01:18:02,509
- Why is this...
-  Never mind.

2369
01:18:02,510 --> 01:18:03,569
Team Jung Bong.

2370
01:18:03,570 --> 01:18:05,780
(Min Ji from Team Jung Bong again)

2371
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:07,610
- i-dle.
-  i-dle?

2372
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:09,479
"My Destiny."

2373
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:11,310
"My Destiny."

2374
01:18:11,780 --> 01:18:12,880
- Wrong.
-  Oh, no.

2375
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:14,220
Team Taek.

2376
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:16,320
"My Fate" by i-dle.

2377
01:18:16,720 --> 01:18:18,349
- That's the same thing.
-  "My Fate?"

2378
01:18:18,350 --> 01:18:19,420
Did you change it from destiny to fate?

2379
01:18:19,490 --> 01:18:20,560
"My Fate?"

2380
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:22,090
- Wrong.
-  Wrong?

2381
01:18:23,230 --> 01:18:24,730
Hye Young, dance only.

2382
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:26,960
- i-dle...
-  I get it.

2383
01:18:26,961 --> 01:18:28,829
- Team Deok Sun.
-  Team Deok Sun.

2384
01:18:28,830 --> 01:18:31,529
- By i-dle...
-  "Fate."

2385
01:18:31,530 --> 01:18:32,569
- Wrong.
-  Correct.

2386
01:18:32,570 --> 01:18:33,900
("Fate")

2387
01:18:34,170 --> 01:18:35,199
(Hye Young ends Round 2.)

2388
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:37,009
How did you know?

2389
01:18:37,010 --> 01:18:38,809
Of course, I know this song.

2390
01:18:38,810 --> 01:18:40,009
Awesome.

2391
01:18:40,010 --> 01:18:41,040
- Wrong.
-  Correct.

2392
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:42,649
(Bitter)

2393
01:18:42,650 --> 01:18:43,710
Did you know?

2394
01:18:43,750 --> 01:18:44,780
I didn't know.

2395
01:18:45,380 --> 01:18:46,749
(Both Taek...)

2396
01:18:46,750 --> 01:18:47,919
(and Sun Woo approve.)

2397
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:48,949
Awesome.

2398
01:18:48,950 --> 01:18:50,020
Really?

2399
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:51,819
She redeemed herself.

2400
01:18:51,820 --> 01:18:53,220
- Fifty points.
-  We're doomed.

2401
01:18:53,420 --> 01:18:54,819
- Next.
-  We're all doomed.

2402
01:18:54,820 --> 01:18:56,230
(The oldest daughter of the Sungs)

2403
01:18:56,430 --> 01:18:58,060
The next players.

2404
01:18:58,530 --> 01:18:59,629
- Is it me now?
-  Your turn.

2405
01:18:59,630 --> 01:19:01,460
- Go.
-  This is crazy.

2406
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:03,630
I don't know any songs.

2407
01:19:04,630 --> 01:19:05,839
Should I go? I'll go.

2408
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:06,869
Good luck.

2409
01:19:06,870 --> 01:19:07,870
(The ace players are participating from other teams.)

2410
01:19:07,871 --> 01:19:08,900
You go.

2411
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:11,169
(Round 3, Hye Ri versus Dong Hwi versus Moo Sung)

2412
01:19:11,170 --> 01:19:12,340
- Let's go.
-  How am I going to beat him?

2413
01:19:13,210 --> 01:19:15,110
This composition is...

2414
01:19:15,140 --> 01:19:17,709
young songs, in-between songs, and old songs.

2415
01:19:17,710 --> 01:19:20,219
This combination basically covers all songs.

2416
01:19:20,220 --> 01:19:21,349
Rock-paper-scissors is important.

2417
01:19:21,350 --> 01:19:22,649
- So...
-  That's very important.

2418
01:19:22,650 --> 01:19:24,120
Rock-paper-scissors is important.

2419
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:26,189
Ready for the rock-paper-scissors?

2420
01:19:26,190 --> 01:19:27,490
(The remaining questions)

2421
01:19:27,620 --> 01:19:28,620
Rock-paper-scissors.

2422
01:19:28,621 --> 01:19:29,760
We have to play rock-paper-scissors.

2423
01:19:30,330 --> 01:19:31,560
- Rock-paper-scissors.
-  Rock-paper-scissors.

2424
01:19:31,930 --> 01:19:32,930
(Dong Hwi wins.)

2425
01:19:32,931 --> 01:19:34,030
- Dong Hwi.
-  See?

2426
01:19:34,530 --> 01:19:36,329
Can you tell us the current score?

2427
01:19:36,330 --> 01:19:37,600
I won't tell you.

2428
01:19:37,970 --> 01:19:39,139
(It's revealed only to the viewers.)

2429
01:19:39,140 --> 01:19:40,940
(Team Deok Sun 30, Team Jung Bong 60, Team Taek and Sun Woo 10)

2430
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,069
I'll go for the 80s and 90s for 10 points.

2431
01:19:43,070 --> 01:19:44,309
- The 80s and 90s for 10 points.
-  Yes.

2432
01:19:44,310 --> 01:19:45,669
- The 80s and 90s for 10 points.
-  Okay.

2433
01:19:45,670 --> 01:19:46,980
(Here is the keyword.)

2434
01:19:48,540 --> 01:19:51,910
(It's important to be fast for a 10-point question.)

2435
01:19:53,780 --> 01:19:54,819
You know this one, right?

2436
01:19:54,820 --> 01:19:56,650
- I do.
-  It sounds so familiar.

2437
01:19:57,750 --> 01:19:58,819
What is it?

2438
01:19:58,820 --> 01:20:00,459
(He can't recall off the top of his head.)

2439
01:20:00,460 --> 01:20:01,520
- I got it.
-  Yes?

2440
01:20:02,360 --> 01:20:03,530
- I got it.
-  Yes?

2441
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:05,429
Three, two...

2442
01:20:05,430 --> 01:20:06,630
"Short Hair" by Cho Yong Pil.

2443
01:20:06,830 --> 01:20:10,500
- Correct.
-  Oh, I'd known.

2444
01:20:10,670 --> 01:20:11,799
- Oh, you got it.
-  It's okay.

2445
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:12,870
I almost had it.

2446
01:20:12,940 --> 01:20:15,500
(Dong Hwi, the game expert, got it.)

2447
01:20:16,570 --> 01:20:18,370
(The giyeok and nieun performance)

2448
01:20:19,410 --> 01:20:21,310
(The short hair performance)

2449
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:23,109
Good job.

2450
01:20:23,110 --> 01:20:25,150
(Why is she dancing?)

2451
01:20:25,580 --> 01:20:27,250
She's there to dance.

2452
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:28,920
(Correct)

2453
01:20:29,050 --> 01:20:31,020
- Right.
-  Dong Hwi, congratulations.

2454
01:20:31,190 --> 01:20:32,720
- Pick the present, Dong Hwi.
-  Choose now.

2455
01:20:32,820 --> 01:20:33,820
The present.

2456
01:20:33,821 --> 01:20:35,359
Movie soundtrack...

2457
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:36,460
(Grunting)

2458
01:20:36,660 --> 01:20:37,860
For 20 points.

2459
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:39,859
(Lee Min Ji)

2460
01:20:39,860 --> 01:20:41,830
- Lee Min Ji?
-  Then she should be here.

2461
01:20:42,730 --> 01:20:44,329
- That's interesting.
-  But there's nothing.

2462
01:20:44,330 --> 01:20:45,969
I don't have much experience of watching yours.

2463
01:20:45,970 --> 01:20:47,939
(When the music plays,)

2464
01:20:47,940 --> 01:20:49,169
(people in the room groan.)

2465
01:20:49,170 --> 01:20:50,769
- Moo Sung, this is so famous.
-  Hye Ri.

2466
01:20:50,770 --> 01:20:52,040
- I got it.
-  Team Deok Sun.

2467
01:20:52,410 --> 01:20:54,140
- Deok Sun?
-  "Lady Vengeance."

2468
01:20:54,540 --> 01:20:55,880
"Lady Vengeance?"

2469
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:58,109
- Wrong.
-  Moo Sung, go.

2470
01:20:58,110 --> 01:20:59,480
"Oldboy."

2471
01:20:59,580 --> 01:21:00,679
- What?
-  "Oldboy."

2472
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:01,779
"Oldboy..."

2473
01:21:01,780 --> 01:21:03,019
- Wrong. It's not.
-  No?

2474
01:21:03,020 --> 01:21:04,619
- What is it?
-  It's not?

2475
01:21:04,620 --> 01:21:05,719
It's okay.

2476
01:21:05,720 --> 01:21:06,960
(2 people got it wrong.)

2477
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:09,989
(This man looks as serious as the music.)

2478
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:12,030
- This movie isn't...
-  Do you know?

2479
01:21:12,130 --> 01:21:13,330
a Korean movie.

2480
01:21:14,430 --> 01:21:16,469
- I got it.
-  Yes?

2481
01:21:16,470 --> 01:21:18,399
- "Lust, Caution." - "Lust, Caution."

2482
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:20,340
Hey, you prick.

2483
01:21:20,370 --> 01:21:22,370
- Hey, you prick.
-  "Hey, you prick."

2484
01:21:23,410 --> 01:21:24,709
(Frozen)

2485
01:21:24,710 --> 01:21:27,080
- It is "Lust, Caution." - Stay still.

2486
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:29,080
- Team Deok Sun.
-  Team Deok Sun.

2487
01:21:29,210 --> 01:21:30,479
"Chungking Express."

2488
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:31,779
("Chungking Express")

2489
01:21:31,780 --> 01:21:32,880
Wrong.

2490
01:21:33,250 --> 01:21:35,179
(Focus on the hint, Lee Min Ji.)

2491
01:21:35,180 --> 01:21:36,650
The hint is Lee Min Ji.

2492
01:21:36,790 --> 01:21:38,119
- Joey Wong.
-  Who is Lee Min Ji?

2493
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:40,520
It's not Joey Wong. What is her face?

2494
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:42,189
Lee Min Ji, what did you do?

2495
01:21:42,190 --> 01:21:43,289
(In the drama, Lee Min Ji's nickname was...)

2496
01:21:43,290 --> 01:21:44,560
My nickname.

2497
01:21:45,130 --> 01:21:46,600
I have a friend...

2498
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,530
named Joey Wong.

2499
01:21:49,870 --> 01:21:51,169
I have one more,

2500
01:21:51,170 --> 01:21:52,500
and her name is Maggie Cheung.

2501
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:55,540
Her name is Wang Ja Hyeon. We call her Joey Wong.

2502
01:21:55,910 --> 01:21:57,010
Hello.

2503
01:21:57,410 --> 01:21:59,640
She's Jang Mi Ok. We call her Maggie Cheung.

2504
01:22:01,210 --> 01:22:02,379
Hello.

2505
01:22:02,380 --> 01:22:03,549
(Maggie Cheung)

2506
01:22:03,550 --> 01:22:05,249
(One of Maggie Cheung's famous works)

2507
01:22:05,250 --> 01:22:07,550
("In the Mood for Love" directed by Wong Karwai)

2508
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:10,149
Lee Min Ji, say out loud...

2509
01:22:10,150 --> 01:22:11,450
what your nickname is.

2510
01:22:11,550 --> 01:22:13,560
- Maggie Cheung.
-  Yes, Maggie Cheung.

2511
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:15,620
- Isn't it "Chungking Express?" - No.

2512
01:22:15,660 --> 01:22:17,890
- "In the Mood for Love." - Yes.

2513
01:22:18,130 --> 01:22:19,189
"In the Mood for Love."

2514
01:22:19,190 --> 01:22:20,230
Correct!

2515
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:22,529
(Moo Sung instantly becomes a hero.)

2516
01:22:22,530 --> 01:22:24,029
- Oh, right.
-  "In the Mood for Love."

2517
01:22:24,030 --> 01:22:25,600
Oh, right. That was it.

2518
01:22:26,100 --> 01:22:28,270
- Oh, that was hard.
-  Starred with Tony Leung.

2519
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:30,469
- It's all in vain.
-  Can you believe "Lust, Caution?"

2520
01:22:30,470 --> 01:22:32,009
Can you believe "Lust, Caution?"

2521
01:22:32,010 --> 01:22:33,279
Congratulations.

2522
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:34,409
- Moo Sung, the present.
-  Moo Sung.

2523
01:22:34,410 --> 01:22:35,909
- Moo Sung, why don't you pick one?
-  You can pick one now.

2524
01:22:35,910 --> 01:22:37,550
- The present.
-  All you can do is...

2525
01:22:37,950 --> 01:22:39,879
Why are you disregarding him?

2526
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:41,180
He knows idol songs.

2527
01:22:41,750 --> 01:22:43,619
- Really?
-  From the 2000s to the present.

2528
01:22:43,620 --> 01:22:44,649
No.

2529
01:22:44,650 --> 01:22:45,919
(Blocking immediately)

2530
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:48,220
(Whispering)

2531
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:52,330
She said choose the show theme music for 50 points and stay still.

2532
01:22:52,730 --> 01:22:53,860
How did you hear that?

2533
01:22:54,130 --> 01:22:55,600
- I saw it.
-  But I don't know the answer.

2534
01:22:55,860 --> 01:22:56,999
Hey, follow your will...

2535
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,500
for at least this one.

2536
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:01,999
I... Okay.

2537
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,239
Then 50 points.

2538
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:04,340
The show theme music.

2539
01:23:04,610 --> 01:23:06,679
(Free will)

2540
01:23:06,680 --> 01:23:09,309
- Things are going great.
-  I'm going to stay still.

2541
01:23:09,310 --> 01:23:10,949
Stay still.

2542
01:23:10,950 --> 01:23:12,010
It's short?

2543
01:23:14,350 --> 01:23:17,790
(Very intense intro)

2544
01:23:20,490 --> 01:23:22,220
You should know upon hearing it.

2545
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:23,760
- What was that?
-  I've never heard of it.

2546
01:23:23,860 --> 01:23:26,159
You might have heard...

2547
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:27,900
the pong pong sound in the beginning.

2548
01:23:29,230 --> 01:23:30,599
- This is the important part.
-  Here.

2549
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:31,829
(This part)

2550
01:23:31,830 --> 01:23:33,340
- This is the important part.
-  It's the beginning.

2551
01:23:33,970 --> 01:23:38,070
(Have you noticed?)

2552
01:23:39,246 --> 01:23:40,476
(This part)

2553
01:23:41,788 --> 01:23:43,388
- This is the important part.
-  It's the beginning.

2554
01:23:43,994 --> 01:23:47,234
(Have you noticed?)

2555
01:23:48,434 --> 01:23:49,904
("2 Days 1 Night")

2556
01:23:50,334 --> 01:23:52,303
("2 Days 1 Night")

2557
01:23:52,304 --> 01:23:54,074
(Korea's top traveling and wild variety show on KBS)

2558
01:23:54,504 --> 01:23:56,774
(Na Yeong Seok once directed "2 Days 1 Night.")

2559
01:23:56,874 --> 01:23:58,044
I have no idea.

2560
01:23:58,504 --> 01:23:59,644
Is it from eggiscoming?

2561
01:24:00,314 --> 01:24:02,043
It's related to me...

2562
01:24:02,044 --> 01:24:03,814
- Team Deok Sun.
-  Team Deok Sun.

2563
01:24:03,984 --> 01:24:05,083
"Earth Arcade?"

2564
01:24:05,084 --> 01:24:06,214
"Earth Arcade."

2565
01:24:06,484 --> 01:24:07,984
- Wrong.
-  What a relief.

2566
01:24:08,214 --> 01:24:09,754
- That's 50 points deducted.
-  Points deducted.

2567
01:24:10,054 --> 01:24:11,984
You lost patience and failed to stay still.

2568
01:24:12,654 --> 01:24:14,224
It's the old one.

2569
01:24:14,294 --> 01:24:15,823
- The old one.
-  The old one.

2570
01:24:15,824 --> 01:24:17,523
We did it before.

2571
01:24:17,524 --> 01:24:18,524
No?

2572
01:24:18,664 --> 01:24:20,063
- Team Deok Sun.
-  Team Deok Sun.

2573
01:24:20,064 --> 01:24:21,134
"2 Days 1 Night."

2574
01:24:21,634 --> 01:24:22,663
Correct.

2575
01:24:22,664 --> 01:24:23,763
("2 Days 1 Night")

2576
01:24:23,764 --> 01:24:25,434
Good job.

2577
01:24:25,664 --> 01:24:27,704
- Yes. Good job.
-  It's okay. You did a good job.

2578
01:24:27,904 --> 01:24:29,174
She resolves it in the end.

2579
01:24:29,704 --> 01:24:30,873
My wonderful daughter.

2580
01:24:30,874 --> 01:24:32,043
Nice defense.

2581
01:24:32,044 --> 01:24:33,473
You may have lost your score,

2582
01:24:33,474 --> 01:24:36,314
but you still get to pick the question.

2583
01:24:36,884 --> 01:24:38,613
- Hye Ri?
-  The present for 40 points.

2584
01:24:38,614 --> 01:24:40,214
- The present for 40 points.
-  Yes.

2585
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:40,640
- This is the important part.
-  Here.

2586
01:24:40,314 --> 01:24:41,383
She knows it.

2587
01:24:41,384 --> 01:24:43,584
(So, Hye Ri's one-man show begins.)

2588
01:24:44,024 --> 01:24:47,723
(The breeze is just fresh enough that it feels great)

2589
01:24:47,724 --> 01:24:49,123
(Yoo-hoo)

2590
01:24:49,124 --> 01:24:51,524
She's performing even though she knows it.

2591
01:24:52,624 --> 01:24:53,764
Team Deok Sun.

2592
01:24:54,434 --> 01:24:56,203
- Please.
-  Please.

2593
01:24:56,204 --> 01:24:57,363
- Wrong.
-  Deok Sun.

2594
01:24:57,364 --> 01:24:58,564
Minus 40 points?

2595
01:24:59,804 --> 01:25:01,733
- That's...
-  Say what's certain first.

2596
01:25:01,734 --> 01:25:02,904
"Hello."

2597
01:25:03,404 --> 01:25:04,573
(Is that it?)

2598
01:25:04,574 --> 01:25:06,314
No. Look.

2599
01:25:06,774 --> 01:25:08,914
(Jeering)

2600
01:25:09,014 --> 01:25:10,613
Hey, you're late. Time's up.

2601
01:25:10,614 --> 01:25:12,184
- You have to name the artist too.
-  Time's up.

2602
01:25:12,414 --> 01:25:13,453
The artist?

2603
01:25:13,454 --> 01:25:15,154
"Nice to Meet You" by Lee Sang Mi.

2604
01:25:15,454 --> 01:25:16,623
Correct.

2605
01:25:16,624 --> 01:25:17,853
("Nice to Meet You" by Lee Sang Mi)

2606
01:25:17,854 --> 01:25:18,883
But...

2607
01:25:18,884 --> 01:25:19,894
(It is correct, but...)

2608
01:25:20,024 --> 01:25:21,753
That counts.

2609
01:25:21,754 --> 01:25:23,223
(Something's wrong.)

2610
01:25:23,224 --> 01:25:25,023
But...

2611
01:25:25,024 --> 01:25:26,493
- for getting one word wrong...
-  We...

2612
01:25:26,494 --> 01:25:27,693
- Because of the river...
-  We lost so many points...

2613
01:25:27,694 --> 01:25:28,894
because of the river.

2614
01:25:29,464 --> 01:25:32,463
(Like energetic Hye Ri who travels upstream)

2615
01:25:32,464 --> 01:25:33,534
Good job.

2616
01:25:33,804 --> 01:25:35,873
It's not wrong...

2617
01:25:35,874 --> 01:25:38,303
because Lee Sang Mi is the lead vocalist.

2618
01:25:38,304 --> 01:25:39,373
That's true.

2619
01:25:39,374 --> 01:25:41,113
Bo Gum has something to say.

2620
01:25:41,114 --> 01:25:43,214
The conscience of the era, Park Bo Gum, you may speak.

2621
01:25:43,584 --> 01:25:44,913
- What is it?
-  Bo Gum.

2622
01:25:44,914 --> 01:25:46,353
- You have to say the group.
-  Sit down.

2623
01:25:46,354 --> 01:25:47,384
Congratulations.

2624
01:25:48,284 --> 01:25:49,823
(Agreed)

2625
01:25:49,824 --> 01:25:51,184
So gentle.

2626
01:25:51,284 --> 01:25:53,454
- You're so gentle.
-  That's cool.

2627
01:25:53,524 --> 01:25:55,653
You deserve to be my son-in-law.

2628
01:25:55,654 --> 01:25:56,863
All right.

2629
01:25:56,864 --> 01:25:58,094
(The husband is Taek.)

2630
01:25:58,194 --> 01:25:59,633
Good job.

2631
01:25:59,634 --> 01:26:00,964
(Round 3 ends.)

2632
01:26:01,294 --> 01:26:03,703
He's going play after you, Mom.

2633
01:26:03,704 --> 01:26:05,104
Right. Go.

2634
01:26:05,464 --> 01:26:06,703
The moms.

2635
01:26:06,704 --> 01:26:08,573
Mom!

2636
01:26:08,574 --> 01:26:10,544
(So, Round 4 becomes the match of the moms.)

2637
01:26:10,744 --> 01:26:13,174
(Watch. This is how moms fight.)

2638
01:26:13,574 --> 01:26:15,614
I'm sorry, but where is my mom?

2639
01:26:16,514 --> 01:26:17,944
Mom.

2640
01:26:18,314 --> 01:26:19,483
Where is my mom?

2641
01:26:19,484 --> 01:26:21,784
It's the movie soundtrack for ten points.

2642
01:26:22,754 --> 01:26:23,854
The gathering.

2643
01:26:24,924 --> 01:26:27,223
(Grand music echoes in the room.)

2644
01:26:27,224 --> 01:26:28,254
Wait.

2645
01:26:28,424 --> 01:26:31,424
(Pretty familiar)

2646
01:26:31,664 --> 01:26:32,864
This is so easy.

2647
01:26:33,464 --> 01:26:34,563
This is so easy.

2648
01:26:34,564 --> 01:26:35,793
This is so easy.

2649
01:26:35,794 --> 01:26:37,033
(If Taek's dad knows, it's super easy.)

2650
01:26:37,034 --> 01:26:38,434
- It's a very famous...
-  What is it?

2651
01:26:39,064 --> 01:26:40,704
But this is so famous. Wait.

2652
01:26:41,474 --> 01:26:42,474
It's worth only ten points?

2653
01:26:44,674 --> 01:26:45,873
She knows it.

2654
01:26:45,874 --> 01:26:46,874
(Her body remembers the song.)

2655
01:26:46,875 --> 01:26:48,374
Mi Ran, what are you doing?

2656
01:26:48,744 --> 01:26:50,183
- Team Jung Bong.
-  Team Jung Bong.

2657
01:26:50,184 --> 01:26:51,944
- "Superman." - No!

2658
01:26:53,284 --> 01:26:54,354
Wrong.

2659
01:26:54,554 --> 01:26:56,384
I never expected "Superman."

2660
01:26:56,454 --> 01:26:57,953
But this is so famous.

2661
01:26:57,954 --> 01:26:59,753
- You got it.
-  It's a very famous...

2662
01:26:59,754 --> 01:27:01,524
foreign blockbuster movie.

2663
01:27:01,594 --> 01:27:03,063
- Wait. What is this?
-  The blockbuster.

2664
01:27:03,064 --> 01:27:05,164
- Don't take it too hard.
-  Don't take it too hard?

2665
01:27:05,224 --> 01:27:06,294
Team Sun Woo.

2666
01:27:07,434 --> 01:27:08,434
"The Avengers?"

2667
01:27:08,794 --> 01:27:10,204
- Okay.
-  Correct.

2668
01:27:11,164 --> 01:27:12,804
(I love you 3,000.)

2669
01:27:13,004 --> 01:27:14,674
Good job.

2670
01:27:15,504 --> 01:27:17,673
But there's nothing I can do.

2671
01:27:17,674 --> 01:27:20,643
I don't know anything other than the movie soundtrack.

2672
01:27:20,644 --> 01:27:22,913
No, you can do the 2000s to the present.

2673
01:27:22,914 --> 01:27:24,613
No, I'm terrible at it. Not that.

2674
01:27:24,614 --> 01:27:25,744
Hey, take the most expensive one.

2675
01:27:25,984 --> 01:27:27,613
- "The most expensive one." - The most expensive one.

2676
01:27:27,614 --> 01:27:28,753
The show theme music...

2677
01:27:28,754 --> 01:27:29,883
- for 40 points.
-  Just go for it.

2678
01:27:29,884 --> 01:27:32,324
Okay. The show theme music for 40 points.

2679
01:27:32,724 --> 01:27:33,753
For 40 points.

2680
01:27:33,754 --> 01:27:34,893
(Right now, the most expensive keyword is...)

2681
01:27:34,894 --> 01:27:36,054
(Lie)

2682
01:27:36,594 --> 01:27:38,564
(Show theme music for 40 points, and the keyword is lie.)

2683
01:27:40,194 --> 01:27:41,194
Oh, wait.

2684
01:27:42,394 --> 01:27:43,933
(The children already noticed.)

2685
01:27:43,934 --> 01:27:45,903
- It's very famous.
-  You have to name the show?

2686
01:27:45,904 --> 01:27:48,004
I don't know. I don't watch TV.

2687
01:27:48,034 --> 01:27:49,503
It's that one.

2688
01:27:49,504 --> 01:27:50,643
(Still new to the three moms)

2689
01:27:50,644 --> 01:27:52,574
Is this a show theme music?

2690
01:27:52,774 --> 01:27:53,914
Isn't this a song?

2691
01:27:54,014 --> 01:27:57,314
I think you've all been on this before.

2692
01:27:58,044 --> 01:27:59,413
Did I appear on this one?

2693
01:27:59,414 --> 01:28:00,954
Yes, you did.

2694
01:28:01,284 --> 01:28:02,454
Me too?

2695
01:28:02,654 --> 01:28:04,524
(Yes.)

2696
01:28:04,954 --> 01:28:06,453
- What about my mom?
-  I did?

2697
01:28:06,454 --> 01:28:07,624
- What about my mom?
-  Sun Young, take it easy.

2698
01:28:08,554 --> 01:28:10,994
- Lee II Hwa appeared too.
-  You appeared too.

2699
01:28:11,094 --> 01:28:12,664
- Team Deok Sun.
-  Team Deok Sun.

2700
01:28:13,564 --> 01:28:14,634
"Happy Together."

2701
01:28:15,264 --> 01:28:16,603
- Wrong.
-  Nice.

2702
01:28:16,604 --> 01:28:17,803
- Sorry.
-  It's close.

2703
01:28:17,804 --> 01:28:19,464
- It's okay.
-  Nice.

2704
01:28:19,564 --> 01:28:20,573
(Haven't you noticed based on the pictures?)

2705
01:28:20,574 --> 01:28:21,933
All three of you appeared.

2706
01:28:21,934 --> 01:28:25,143
All three of you appeared as guest stars.

2707
01:28:25,144 --> 01:28:26,373
(All 3 moms appeared.)

2708
01:28:26,374 --> 01:28:28,144
(The answer is "Radio Star.")

2709
01:28:28,414 --> 01:28:29,844
Is it still on?

2710
01:28:30,214 --> 01:28:31,244
No, right?

2711
01:28:31,514 --> 01:28:33,483
He's the main host.

2712
01:28:33,484 --> 01:28:34,484
(Lie)

2713
01:28:34,784 --> 01:28:35,814
Lie?

2714
01:28:36,354 --> 01:28:37,653
Can I try one more time?

2715
01:28:37,654 --> 01:28:38,883
- Yes.
-  Go ahead.

2716
01:28:38,884 --> 01:28:40,894
- Mom, go.
-  Go.

2717
01:28:41,254 --> 01:28:42,594
- Team Deok Sun.
-  Team Deok Sun.

2718
01:28:42,754 --> 01:28:44,124
- "Radio Star." - Correct.

2719
01:28:45,364 --> 01:28:46,794
(Mom kept her promise.)

2720
01:28:46,864 --> 01:28:48,234
Why is it a lie?

2721
01:28:48,864 --> 01:28:50,863
("Gura" in Kim Gu Ra means a lie.)

2722
01:28:50,864 --> 01:28:51,864
Good job!

2723
01:28:51,865 --> 01:28:54,003
Because I don't appear on variety shows,

2724
01:28:54,004 --> 01:28:55,503
"Radio Star" was all I could think of.

2725
01:28:55,504 --> 01:28:56,743
You have to keep going.

2726
01:28:56,744 --> 01:28:57,844
Do I keep going?

2727
01:28:58,604 --> 01:28:59,643
I appeared on that show...

2728
01:28:59,644 --> 01:29:00,674
- ten years ago.
-  Did you?

2729
01:29:01,044 --> 01:29:03,384
I appeared before "Reply 1988." That's 11 years ago.

2730
01:29:04,014 --> 01:29:05,443
II Hwa, choose one.

2731
01:29:05,444 --> 01:29:07,853
The show theme music for 30 points.

2732
01:29:07,854 --> 01:29:09,283
The show theme music for 30 points.

2733
01:29:09,284 --> 01:29:10,453
(Show theme music for 30 points, and the keyword is spicy.)

2734
01:29:10,454 --> 01:29:11,553
What is it?

2735
01:29:11,554 --> 01:29:14,254
(The intense intro that seizes the audience)

2736
01:29:14,694 --> 01:29:18,064
(The drum beat is as pounding as the heartbeat.)

2737
01:29:18,464 --> 01:29:19,464
Spicy?

2738
01:29:23,034 --> 01:29:24,434
It's a competition show.

2739
01:29:25,364 --> 01:29:26,704
It was very famous.

2740
01:29:27,734 --> 01:29:28,734
Team Jung Bong.

2741
01:29:28,735 --> 01:29:29,943
- What? What are you doing?
-  No.

2742
01:29:29,944 --> 01:29:32,304
- What? What are you doing?
-  No.

2743
01:29:32,504 --> 01:29:34,443
- No way.
-  "Superstar K."

2744
01:29:34,444 --> 01:29:35,444
I think it's correct.

2745
01:29:36,384 --> 01:29:38,184
- Wrong.
-  Wrong?

2746
01:29:38,714 --> 01:29:40,654
This show is on that channel.

2747
01:29:41,384 --> 01:29:44,924
(Deok Sun suddenly pulls her sister.)

2748
01:29:47,494 --> 01:29:48,994
It has nothing to do with that.

2749
01:29:49,224 --> 01:29:50,763
Just do it. It has nothing to do with that.

2750
01:29:50,764 --> 01:29:52,864
- That's the one.
-  That's the one?

2751
01:29:53,634 --> 01:29:55,134
- Oh, I know.
-  The dancing show.

2752
01:29:55,294 --> 01:29:57,633
- Oh, that one.
-  Really?

2753
01:29:57,634 --> 01:29:59,133
(Everyone starts to get it...)

2754
01:29:59,134 --> 01:30:00,634
(as the passionate dance battle continues.)

2755
01:30:00,874 --> 01:30:01,904
Team Jung Bong.

2756
01:30:02,074 --> 01:30:03,973
- Team Jung Bong.
-  "Street Woman Fighter."

2757
01:30:03,974 --> 01:30:05,044
Correct.

2758
01:30:06,144 --> 01:30:08,214
(They danced for nothing.)

2759
01:30:08,744 --> 01:30:10,884
- I almost forgot. It's the same.
-  We're back to square one.

2760
01:30:11,044 --> 01:30:13,654
Why did you do that for nothing?

2761
01:30:13,984 --> 01:30:15,884
Thank you.

2762
01:30:16,314 --> 01:30:18,624
Hey, give us 15 points.

2763
01:30:19,584 --> 01:30:20,824
Since it's worth 30 points.

2764
01:30:20,994 --> 01:30:23,494
All right. The 2000s to the present.

2765
01:30:24,194 --> 01:30:25,294
For 30 points.

2766
01:30:26,434 --> 01:30:27,434
Cool.

2767
01:30:27,435 --> 01:30:28,864
- Let's go.
-  Cool.

2768
01:30:29,294 --> 01:30:30,834
- Blank blank blank?
-  Is that a song title?

2769
01:30:31,834 --> 01:30:34,133
- Do I guess the song title?
-  Blank blank blank?

2770
01:30:34,134 --> 01:30:37,473
(I shed tears)

2771
01:30:37,474 --> 01:30:40,213
(When I walk this road)

2772
01:30:40,214 --> 01:30:42,314
- Oh, I know this one.
-  The song title and the singer?

2773
01:30:42,444 --> 01:30:43,884
The singer and the song title.

2774
01:30:45,044 --> 01:30:46,983
(I can't stop thinking)

2775
01:30:46,984 --> 01:30:48,454
- I...
-  Team Jung Bong.

2776
01:30:48,714 --> 01:30:49,953
Team Jung Bong was faster.

2777
01:30:49,954 --> 01:30:51,653
- Lim Young Woong.
-  Lim Young Woong?

2778
01:30:51,654 --> 01:30:52,884
"Love Always Run Away."

2779
01:30:53,524 --> 01:30:54,594
Correct.

2780
01:30:54,994 --> 01:30:56,694
(Getting 2 questions in a row including the last one)

2781
01:30:57,464 --> 01:30:59,364
(Disappointed)

2782
01:30:59,494 --> 01:31:01,993
Even though I starred in it, I missed it.

2783
01:31:01,994 --> 01:31:03,703
- Really?
-  I starred in it.

2784
01:31:03,704 --> 01:31:05,204
My mom starred in it.

2785
01:31:05,964 --> 01:31:08,934
(Sorry, Young Woong.)

2786
01:31:09,404 --> 01:31:12,703
It's on Mi Ran's playlist.

2787
01:31:12,704 --> 01:31:16,274
It's been on her playlist for years.

2788
01:31:16,714 --> 01:31:17,943
It's "Young Lady and Gentleman."

2789
01:31:17,944 --> 01:31:19,043
Jae Hong?

2790
01:31:19,044 --> 01:31:20,583
- Jae Hong, good luck.
-  Good luck.

2791
01:31:20,584 --> 01:31:21,784
It's your turn now.

2792
01:31:21,984 --> 01:31:23,013
(Finally, the last round)

2793
01:31:23,014 --> 01:31:24,784
But the present...

2794
01:31:25,024 --> 01:31:26,894
- But they're...
-  Just don't do anything.

2795
01:31:27,194 --> 01:31:28,423
It's an iffy group.

2796
01:31:28,424 --> 01:31:29,453
(Jae Hong from Team Jung Bong)

2797
01:31:29,454 --> 01:31:30,693
It's iffy. It's unpredictable.

2798
01:31:30,694 --> 01:31:32,524
Even if we get everything, it's only worth 60 points.

2799
01:31:33,124 --> 01:31:35,733
(The 3 last players...)

2800
01:31:35,734 --> 01:31:38,634
(will have the last round on 4 questions.)

2801
01:31:39,064 --> 01:31:41,204
(Once again, the winner...)

2802
01:31:41,604 --> 01:31:43,804
I said the winner gets the Korean beef set.

2803
01:31:43,974 --> 01:31:46,373
You can take one home each.

2804
01:31:46,374 --> 01:31:48,013
(On the other hand, the bottom team...)

2805
01:31:48,014 --> 01:31:50,244
(gets a small penalty which will be coming soon.)

2806
01:31:50,414 --> 01:31:51,984
The present songs for 20 points.

2807
01:31:53,084 --> 01:31:56,824
(The hint is 1988 when it's Team Reply 1988.)

2808
01:31:57,324 --> 01:31:59,523
- You have a chance.
-  Get yourself together.

2809
01:31:59,524 --> 01:32:01,094
It appeared in "Reply 1988."

2810
01:32:02,054 --> 01:32:03,794
(Exclaiming)

2811
01:32:04,094 --> 01:32:05,964
- Get yourself together.
-  It appeared in "Reply 1988."

2812
01:32:06,464 --> 01:32:09,234
(Sun Young reacts as soon as she hears it.)

2813
01:32:09,434 --> 01:32:10,804
- You don't know this one?
-  Jae Hong.

2814
01:32:11,504 --> 01:32:12,834
Jae Hong, you should know.

2815
01:32:13,434 --> 01:32:15,474
(The physical hint)

2816
01:32:16,334 --> 01:32:18,103
- You don't know?
-  It appears.

2817
01:32:18,104 --> 01:32:19,104
- The English title appears...
-  It appeared in the drama.

2818
01:32:19,105 --> 01:32:20,114
in the song.

2819
01:32:20,474 --> 01:32:21,544
Jae Hong.

2820
01:32:23,144 --> 01:32:24,914
But it's such a famous song.

2821
01:32:25,844 --> 01:32:28,014
- Jung Bong.
-  That's it. That's the one.

2822
01:32:28,084 --> 01:32:31,223
- "Too Bad" by G-DRAGON.
-  Yes.

2823
01:32:31,224 --> 01:32:32,284
Correct.

2824
01:32:33,024 --> 01:32:34,193
Good job.

2825
01:32:34,194 --> 01:32:35,323
(Team Jung Bong's off to a good start.)

2826
01:32:35,324 --> 01:32:36,394
- Correct.
-  Correct.

2827
01:32:36,664 --> 01:32:37,994
(Groaning)

2828
01:32:38,094 --> 01:32:40,034
- I had no idea.
-  How are you supposed to get it?

2829
01:32:40,334 --> 01:32:42,893
- It's okay.
-  It's okay.

2830
01:32:42,894 --> 01:32:44,663
- It's okay.
-  There are still three left.

2831
01:32:44,664 --> 01:32:46,234
There are still three left for you to answer.

2832
01:32:46,534 --> 01:32:48,833
- It's a bummer.
-  It's okay.

2833
01:32:48,834 --> 01:32:50,073
(However, Jung Bong the Tchaikovsky continues to thrive.)

2834
01:32:50,074 --> 01:32:51,203
That was so close.

2835
01:32:51,204 --> 01:32:52,543
- Good job.
-  Good job.

2836
01:32:52,544 --> 01:32:54,343
The show theme music for 20 points.

2837
01:32:54,344 --> 01:32:56,014
The show theme music for 20 points.

2838
01:32:57,014 --> 01:33:00,283
(The loud trumpet sound that wakes up the morning)

2839
01:33:00,284 --> 01:33:01,383
This is so easy.

2840
01:33:01,384 --> 01:33:02,483
- I got it.
-  I got it.

2841
01:33:02,484 --> 01:33:03,823
- Jung Bong said it first.
-  Jung Bong.

2842
01:33:03,824 --> 01:33:05,124
- Wait.
-  "Scholarship Quiz."

2843
01:33:05,584 --> 01:33:06,594
Wrong.

2844
01:33:06,754 --> 01:33:08,224
- No?
-  Mr. Ryu!

2845
01:33:08,394 --> 01:33:09,454
"Backpack Travels."

2846
01:33:09,494 --> 01:33:11,493
- No!
-  Wrong.

2847
01:33:11,494 --> 01:33:12,894
(Because No Eul also got it wrong...)

2848
01:33:12,994 --> 01:33:14,364
- "Morning Forum." - Correct.

2849
01:33:15,164 --> 01:33:17,104
(He got 2 questions in a row.)

2850
01:33:17,304 --> 01:33:19,333
Next is the show theme music for ten points.

2851
01:33:19,334 --> 01:33:20,404
The show theme music for ten points.

2852
01:33:22,374 --> 01:33:23,574
- Jung Bong.
-  Jung Bong.

2853
01:33:23,974 --> 01:33:25,104
"You Quiz on the Block."

2854
01:33:25,644 --> 01:33:26,644
Correct!

2855
01:33:27,444 --> 01:33:29,914
That's hard for Jae Myung.

2856
01:33:30,044 --> 01:33:34,054
(Dazed)

2857
01:33:36,184 --> 01:33:37,684
(Jung Bong is good at everything except studying.)

2858
01:33:38,284 --> 01:33:40,954
Good job. My team is great.

2859
01:33:41,224 --> 01:33:42,993
It's already the last question.

2860
01:33:42,994 --> 01:33:45,464
- Jae Myung, do your best.
-  Yes.

2861
01:33:45,694 --> 01:33:48,034
- Automatically the last question...
-  There's only one left.

2862
01:33:48,194 --> 01:33:49,664
- Kang Ha Neul.
-  Kang Ha Neul.

2863
01:33:50,234 --> 01:33:52,403
The one who gets the last question wins.

2864
01:33:52,404 --> 01:33:54,604
- The speed is crucial.
-  It's worth ten points.

2865
01:33:55,234 --> 01:33:56,373
(From the 2000s to the present, and the keyword is Kang Ha Neul.)

2866
01:33:56,374 --> 01:33:58,544
Don't say anything until Jae Myung answers it.

2867
01:34:00,844 --> 01:34:02,714
(No Eul, copy me.)

2868
01:34:07,554 --> 01:34:08,683
They don't know it.

2869
01:34:08,684 --> 01:34:10,654
- Stay still.
-  Stay still.

2870
01:34:12,054 --> 01:34:13,223
Team Deok Sun.

2871
01:34:13,224 --> 01:34:14,293
(Finally, Team Deok Sun)

2872
01:34:14,294 --> 01:34:15,793
- He got it.
-  He got it.

2873
01:34:15,794 --> 01:34:16,864
It's SHINee.

2874
01:34:17,024 --> 01:34:18,894
- SHINee?
-  I don't know the title.

2875
01:34:19,164 --> 01:34:21,094
- "Lucifer." - What's the title again?

2876
01:34:21,434 --> 01:34:23,293
- Sixty percent?
-  "Lucifer."

2877
01:34:23,294 --> 01:34:24,704
- "Lucifer." - "Lucifer."

2878
01:34:24,834 --> 01:34:25,834
Correct.

2879
01:34:27,404 --> 01:34:28,734
You still got one.

2880
01:34:29,034 --> 01:34:30,243
Love will be bound too

2881
01:34:30,244 --> 01:34:32,244
(Deok Sun's filling in for No Eul.)

2882
01:34:32,644 --> 01:34:33,873
(Love will be bound too)

2883
01:34:33,874 --> 01:34:34,943
Good job.

2884
01:34:34,944 --> 01:34:36,174
(Even the future will be bound)

2885
01:34:36,344 --> 01:34:38,044
(Giving up)

2886
01:34:38,184 --> 01:34:39,784
How can she dance to all songs?

2887
01:34:40,614 --> 01:34:42,854
- She's a singer.
-  No more.

2888
01:34:42,954 --> 01:34:44,854
Why am I getting sweaty over this?

2889
01:34:45,654 --> 01:34:47,323
- Because you danced.
-  Is that right?

2890
01:34:47,324 --> 01:34:48,694
All right then.

2891
01:34:49,094 --> 01:34:50,893
You'll have dinner soon,

2892
01:34:50,894 --> 01:34:53,964
and the menu is barbecue. We'll prepare it.

2893
01:34:54,734 --> 01:34:57,604
Unlike the first place, the bottom place...

2894
01:34:58,364 --> 01:34:59,904
will go out...

2895
01:35:00,174 --> 01:35:01,803
to grill the meat...

2896
01:35:01,804 --> 01:35:03,544
for the other families.

2897
01:35:03,904 --> 01:35:06,103
Why are you telling me that now?

2898
01:35:06,104 --> 01:35:08,314
I'm amazing at grilling. I'll do it.

2899
01:35:08,814 --> 01:35:10,683
But nothing guarantees that we are at the bottom.

2900
01:35:10,684 --> 01:35:12,143
- Right. That's true.
-  Yes.

2901
01:35:12,144 --> 01:35:13,384
(Yes, that's true.)

2902
01:35:13,714 --> 01:35:15,113
- It won't be us.
-  So...

2903
01:35:15,114 --> 01:35:16,554
As long as they didn't place the bottom.

2904
01:35:16,724 --> 01:35:17,753
- Why?
-  Why?

2905
01:35:17,754 --> 01:35:19,323
Because they'll end up eating everything as they grill.

2906
01:35:19,324 --> 01:35:20,723
- Right.
-  We won't get anything.

2907
01:35:20,724 --> 01:35:22,424
We might end up eating only doenjang.

2908
01:35:22,554 --> 01:35:23,563
- As long as Team Deok Sun...
-  We might...

2909
01:35:23,564 --> 01:35:24,564
- didn't place last.
-  be having doenjang only.

2910
01:35:24,624 --> 01:35:26,394
Let him finish his sentence.

2911
01:35:26,464 --> 01:35:27,593
(Speed up, please.)

2912
01:35:27,594 --> 01:35:29,594
All right. Here are your scores.

2913
01:35:29,764 --> 01:35:31,004
First, Team Deok Sun.

2914
01:35:31,504 --> 01:35:34,073
- What did we get?
-  Your original score was 60.

2915
01:35:34,074 --> 01:35:37,344
- Okay.
-  After the music quiz,

2916
01:35:38,804 --> 01:35:40,643
it's minus 50 points. Congratulations.

2917
01:35:40,644 --> 01:35:42,774
(Make some noise.)

2918
01:35:42,914 --> 01:35:45,044
- Good job.
-  That's still good.

2919
01:35:45,084 --> 01:35:46,343
That's pretty good.

2920
01:35:46,344 --> 01:35:48,984
- Our score might be below zero too.
-  No.

2921
01:35:49,254 --> 01:35:50,624
Let's hear him first.

2922
01:35:50,654 --> 01:35:51,754
Team Jung Bong.

2923
01:35:51,984 --> 01:35:53,593
Your original score was 110.

2924
01:35:53,594 --> 01:35:54,924
That was so high.

2925
01:35:55,094 --> 01:35:57,124
You got 120. Congratulations.

2926
01:35:57,294 --> 01:35:59,064
- Ten points.
-  That's ten points higher.

2927
01:35:59,624 --> 01:36:01,134
Why did we bother?

2928
01:36:01,694 --> 01:36:03,133
We got ten points in the end.

2929
01:36:03,134 --> 01:36:04,833
(They struggled to get 10 points.)

2930
01:36:04,834 --> 01:36:06,333
Despite answering so many questions.

2931
01:36:06,334 --> 01:36:07,834
I won ten points.

2932
01:36:07,904 --> 01:36:09,104
(Reality hit)

2933
01:36:09,404 --> 01:36:10,644
Lastly, Team Taek.

2934
01:36:10,974 --> 01:36:12,303
Is it neck and neck?

2935
01:36:12,304 --> 01:36:14,213
You began with 60 points.

2936
01:36:14,214 --> 01:36:15,273
- Okay.
-  They did a good job at the end.

2937
01:36:15,274 --> 01:36:16,614
After the music quiz,

2938
01:36:17,714 --> 01:36:19,544
with minus 160 points, you are at the bottom.

2939
01:36:19,744 --> 01:36:21,954
(The total, minus 160 points)

2940
01:36:22,054 --> 01:36:24,783
(The absolute bottom place)

2941
01:36:24,784 --> 01:36:25,784
That's so funny.

2942
01:36:25,785 --> 01:36:27,754
Did we do so badly?

2943
01:36:28,794 --> 01:36:29,794
How cool.

2944
01:36:29,795 --> 01:36:31,494
We'll grill meat well.

2945
01:36:31,524 --> 01:36:32,993
Team Taek and Sun Woo, go out...

2946
01:36:32,994 --> 01:36:34,463
- and prepare to grill meat.
-  Okay.

2947
01:36:34,464 --> 01:36:37,003
Tomorrow morning, we'll load your vehicle...

2948
01:36:37,004 --> 01:36:38,403
with the Korean beef set.

2949
01:36:38,404 --> 01:36:39,664
- Congratulations.
-  Thank you.

2950
01:36:39,864 --> 01:36:42,134
(It's time for dinner.)

2951
01:36:42,474 --> 01:36:44,474
I need some fresh air. It's so hot.

2952
01:36:44,874 --> 01:36:46,073
I know. It's hot.

2953
01:36:46,074 --> 01:36:47,514
(Ssangmun-dong got heated up thanks to Family Entertainment.)

2954
01:36:47,914 --> 01:36:50,384
(Charcoal gets heated up as well.)

2955
01:36:51,084 --> 01:36:53,914
(They'll get a fiery taste today.)

2956
01:36:54,484 --> 01:36:56,584
(Pork, beef, sausage, mushroom, potato)

2957
01:36:57,484 --> 01:36:59,454
(From juicy and plump pork...)

2958
01:37:00,154 --> 01:37:02,594
(to well-marbled beef)

2959
01:37:03,124 --> 01:37:05,724
(It's a complete barbecue set.)

2960
01:37:06,124 --> 01:37:07,863
- Will you go and grill meat?
-  Yes.

2961
01:37:07,864 --> 01:37:08,934
Okay.

2962
01:37:09,364 --> 01:37:11,764
I can't wait to eat grilled meat.

2963
01:37:12,034 --> 01:37:13,404
(Determined)

2964
01:37:13,504 --> 01:37:15,204
It's okay. I'll grill meat alone.

2965
01:37:15,804 --> 01:37:16,873
(Leave the barbecue to Kyung Pyo today.)

2966
01:37:16,874 --> 01:37:17,904
Okay.

2967
01:37:18,074 --> 01:37:19,774
It's insane.

2968
01:37:23,684 --> 01:37:26,514
(He puts beef on the grill.)

2969
01:37:26,884 --> 01:37:27,984
It's just...

2970
01:37:28,254 --> 01:37:29,984
It's just insane.

2971
01:37:31,424 --> 01:37:32,853
This meat will taste amazing.

2972
01:37:32,854 --> 01:37:34,654
(Glossy meat gets grilled in an appetizing way.)

2973
01:37:34,894 --> 01:37:37,863
(Cooked meat)

2974
01:37:37,864 --> 01:37:39,964
(A big pile)

2975
01:37:40,164 --> 01:37:42,194
(Running over)

2976
01:37:42,994 --> 01:37:45,734
(He assists Kyung Pyo by cutting the meat.)

2977
01:37:46,004 --> 01:37:47,233
I'll do it.

2978
01:37:47,234 --> 01:37:48,604
(It's okay.)

2979
01:37:48,804 --> 01:37:50,773
(He cuts the meat into bite-sized pieces...)

2980
01:37:50,774 --> 01:37:52,474
(and delivers it.)

2981
01:37:52,544 --> 01:37:53,674
It's grilled meat.

2982
01:37:53,914 --> 01:37:55,074
Is it grilled already?

2983
01:37:55,644 --> 01:37:57,283
(He dips it in the oil sauce.)

2984
01:37:57,284 --> 01:37:58,444
It's so tasty.

2985
01:37:59,844 --> 01:38:01,184
It's so tasty.

2986
01:38:01,954 --> 01:38:03,384
(Eating)

2987
01:38:03,954 --> 01:38:05,654
Eating it right after it's grilled...

2988
01:38:06,724 --> 01:38:07,893
Is it salt?

2989
01:38:07,894 --> 01:38:09,794
(Il Hwa dips it in salt and takes a bite.)

2990
01:38:10,824 --> 01:38:11,924
It's tasty.

2991
01:38:12,894 --> 01:38:14,434
(Salt)

2992
01:38:15,064 --> 01:38:17,264
(Dong Il dips it in salt as well.)

2993
01:38:17,634 --> 01:38:18,804
It's nice.

2994
01:38:19,504 --> 01:38:21,634
(Bo Gum makes a wrap right away.)

2995
01:38:21,774 --> 01:38:22,904
We need more.

2996
01:38:23,304 --> 01:38:25,444
(He feeds Kyung Pyo who is manning the grill.)

2997
01:38:26,074 --> 01:38:27,614
(Even after that)

2998
01:38:28,314 --> 01:38:30,174
(A wrap)

2999
01:38:30,214 --> 01:38:31,284
This meat...

3000
01:38:31,784 --> 01:38:33,213
- Thank you.
-  I don't know if it's cooked.

3001
01:38:33,214 --> 01:38:34,253
It's so tasty.

3002
01:38:34,254 --> 01:38:35,254
(Bo Gum is in charge of Kyung Pyo's wraps.)

3003
01:38:35,514 --> 01:38:36,854
What is it? Is it beef?

3004
01:38:37,024 --> 01:38:38,024
It's beef.

3005
01:38:38,025 --> 01:38:39,353
Are there pork and beef?

3006
01:38:39,354 --> 01:38:40,423
- Yes.
-  That's incredible.

3007
01:38:40,424 --> 01:38:42,023
- That's amazing.
-  It's incredible.

3008
01:38:42,024 --> 01:38:43,153
- It's incredible.
-  Do you need help?

3009
01:38:43,154 --> 01:38:44,664
Help me cut meat later.

3010
01:38:45,064 --> 01:38:47,963
Most people sprinkle pepper to eliminate the smell of pork.

3011
01:38:47,964 --> 01:38:50,093
- But doing so shrinks the meat.
-  Shall I grill this?

3012
01:38:50,094 --> 01:38:51,663
- Pork shoulder?
-  Let's grill pork shoulder.

3013
01:38:51,664 --> 01:38:52,763
Let's grill pork shoulder.

3014
01:38:52,764 --> 01:38:53,804
(He assists with grilling.)

3015
01:38:55,774 --> 01:38:56,903
Pork shoulder is so tasty.

3016
01:38:56,904 --> 01:38:58,174
- It's so tasty.
-  Seriously.

3017
01:38:59,604 --> 01:39:00,873
Why are you here?

3018
01:39:00,874 --> 01:39:02,113
- I came to help.
-  He came to help.

3019
01:39:02,114 --> 01:39:03,174
Really?

3020
01:39:03,914 --> 01:39:06,014
I'll grill the pork shoulder more after cutting it.

3021
01:39:06,644 --> 01:39:07,853
- It's so thick.
-  It's thick.

3022
01:39:07,854 --> 01:39:09,214
(Juice comes out of the thick meat that has been cut.)

3023
01:39:13,024 --> 01:39:14,293
Put it here.

3024
01:39:14,294 --> 01:39:15,994
(They fill a plate with grilled meat in no time.)

3025
01:39:16,554 --> 01:39:17,763
- Thank you.
-  Okay.

3026
01:39:17,764 --> 01:39:19,224
(She assists in delivering the meat.)

3027
01:39:19,594 --> 01:39:21,594
Meat is here.

3028
01:39:22,364 --> 01:39:23,534
Pork is here.

3029
01:39:24,034 --> 01:39:26,004
(He tries the pork that has just come off the grill.)

3030
01:39:26,164 --> 01:39:27,303
(Impressed)

3031
01:39:27,304 --> 01:39:28,904
Pork is also very tasty.

3032
01:39:29,034 --> 01:39:31,174
(Mi Ran prepares a wrap right away.)

3033
01:39:31,344 --> 01:39:34,314
(She puts the whole thing in her mouth.)

3034
01:39:34,374 --> 01:39:35,874
(Another wrap)

3035
01:39:35,974 --> 01:39:37,513
I see that you prefer pork as well.

3036
01:39:37,514 --> 01:39:38,744
- Yes.
-  I prefer pork.

3037
01:39:39,544 --> 01:39:40,913
Pork is tasty.

3038
01:39:40,914 --> 01:39:41,984
- Mi Ran.
-  We have the same tastes.

3039
01:39:42,114 --> 01:39:44,954
(Hye Young eats a wrap just like Mi Ran does.)

3040
01:39:45,124 --> 01:39:46,823
(Clapping)

3041
01:39:46,824 --> 01:39:47,994
It's so tasty.

3042
01:39:48,454 --> 01:39:49,594
- Is it tasty?
-  Yes.

3043
01:39:50,824 --> 01:39:52,324
(Hye Ri dips the meat in ssamjang.)

3044
01:39:52,424 --> 01:39:54,134
(Eating)

3045
01:39:55,434 --> 01:39:56,834
It's so tasty.

3046
01:39:57,104 --> 01:39:58,263
(Impressed)

3047
01:39:58,264 --> 01:39:59,804
(The more she chews, the tastier it gets.)

3048
01:40:00,734 --> 01:40:02,133
Look at Jae Hong.

3049
01:40:02,134 --> 01:40:04,204
Why is he grilling meat?

3050
01:40:04,374 --> 01:40:06,073
He wants to eat hot meat fast.

3051
01:40:06,074 --> 01:40:08,374
(He wants to eat hot meat fast.)

3052
01:40:08,814 --> 01:40:10,214
(Impressed)

3053
01:40:10,684 --> 01:40:13,643
(Kyung Pyo gets a bite.)

3054
01:40:13,644 --> 01:40:15,314
(He gets two bites.)

3055
01:40:15,354 --> 01:40:16,914
Thank you.

3056
01:40:17,554 --> 01:40:18,653
Jae Hong, hurry up and eat.

3057
01:40:18,654 --> 01:40:20,023
Let's grill as we eat.

3058
01:40:20,024 --> 01:40:21,424
(People at the barbecue zone eat hot meat faster than anyone.)

3059
01:40:21,594 --> 01:40:23,593
I'll eat all the meat here.

3060
01:40:23,594 --> 01:40:24,694
It's so nice.

3061
01:40:26,564 --> 01:40:27,593
Have you eaten any meat?

3062
01:40:27,594 --> 01:40:28,733
Yes, I have. I've been eating a lot of meat.

3063
01:40:28,734 --> 01:40:29,794
Bo Gum, go ahead and eat.

3064
01:40:30,164 --> 01:40:32,433
You made a perilla leaf wrap with one piece of beef, right?

3065
01:40:32,434 --> 01:40:33,604
We ate 2 to 3 pieces at a time.

3066
01:40:34,574 --> 01:40:37,004
(Bo Gum gets freshly-grilled meat.)

3067
01:40:37,044 --> 01:40:38,173
Isn't it tasty?

3068
01:40:38,174 --> 01:40:40,004
(Amazed)

3069
01:40:41,074 --> 01:40:42,413
They haven't eaten.

3070
01:40:42,414 --> 01:40:43,444
(People at the barbecue zone)

3071
01:40:43,884 --> 01:40:44,884
Eat.

3072
01:40:44,885 --> 01:40:46,943
- Are you guys eating?
-  We had two plates of meat here.

3073
01:40:46,944 --> 01:40:48,653
- We had two plates of meat here.
-  No wonder the meat wasn't coming.

3074
01:40:48,654 --> 01:40:50,054
- That's right.
-  It was coming too slowly.

3075
01:40:50,114 --> 01:40:51,824
(I'm joking.)

3076
01:40:51,924 --> 01:40:52,983
(Sung Kyun tries a piece since he's outside.)

3077
01:40:52,984 --> 01:40:54,294
The meat you eat here is tasty.

3078
01:40:55,294 --> 01:40:57,024
The meat you eat here is tasty.

3079
01:40:58,024 --> 01:41:00,264
Everyone is eating outside.

3080
01:41:00,564 --> 01:41:01,993
(I'll do the same.)

3081
01:41:01,994 --> 01:41:04,064
- There's so much meat.
-  This place is the real deal.

3082
01:41:04,534 --> 01:41:05,634
Let's grill more pork.

3083
01:41:05,834 --> 01:41:07,073
Here's meat. Taek, here.

3084
01:41:07,074 --> 01:41:08,604
Hurry up and eat here.

3085
01:41:09,174 --> 01:41:11,103
It'll be tasty to make...

3086
01:41:11,104 --> 01:41:12,303
- and eat jjigae here.
-  Okay.

3087
01:41:12,304 --> 01:41:13,673
It's nice to eat standing up.

3088
01:41:13,674 --> 01:41:14,844
(Jjigae is a must when you eat meat.)

3089
01:41:14,874 --> 01:41:16,214
- I'm craving jjigae.
-  Right?

3090
01:41:16,544 --> 01:41:18,943
I've eaten this a lot ever since I was little.

3091
01:41:18,944 --> 01:41:21,253
There are aged kimchi jjigae and beef brisket doenjang jjigae.

3092
01:41:21,254 --> 01:41:22,354
Which one shall we eat?

3093
01:41:22,414 --> 01:41:23,714
- Let's eat both.
-  Okay. One each.

3094
01:41:23,924 --> 01:41:25,284
Rip of the top...

3095
01:41:26,124 --> 01:41:27,323
and pour it in.

3096
01:41:27,324 --> 01:41:28,524
(Pour in the mixture without unfreezing it.)

3097
01:41:28,794 --> 01:41:30,123
There are so many vegetables.

3098
01:41:30,124 --> 01:41:31,324
There are so many solid ingredients, right?

3099
01:41:31,964 --> 01:41:33,593
Then you add one and a half cups of water.

3100
01:41:33,594 --> 01:41:34,864
(One and a half cups of water)

3101
01:41:34,994 --> 01:41:36,364
Now, you just need to boil it.

3102
01:41:37,164 --> 01:41:39,764
(3 minutes after boiling)

3103
01:41:40,304 --> 01:41:42,804
(The simple jjigae is done.)

3104
01:41:43,204 --> 01:41:45,544
(Kyoung Pyo picks kimchi jjigae.)

3105
01:41:48,774 --> 01:41:49,774
What?

3106
01:41:49,814 --> 01:41:51,684
Gosh, it's so rich.

3107
01:41:52,414 --> 01:41:55,254
(Jae Hong tries doenjang jjigae.)

3108
01:41:55,454 --> 01:41:56,714
It's so refreshing.

3109
01:41:58,054 --> 01:42:00,594
(He tries one more spoon.)

3110
01:42:00,994 --> 01:42:02,593
It really feels like I'm sharing a meal...

3111
01:42:02,594 --> 01:42:05,123
- with everyone in Ssangmun-dong.
-  Right?

3112
01:42:05,124 --> 01:42:07,634
- It's so nice to come here.
-  That's right.

3113
01:42:07,764 --> 01:42:09,634
It was my first time playing such games.

3114
01:42:10,934 --> 01:42:12,364
Mi Ran was good at games.

3115
01:42:13,664 --> 01:42:15,434
- Seriously.
-  I'm really bad at games.

3116
01:42:15,974 --> 01:42:17,303
You aren't as bad as I am.

3117
01:42:17,304 --> 01:42:19,404
But some people are worse.

3118
01:42:19,804 --> 01:42:20,843
She was strategic.

3119
01:42:20,844 --> 01:42:21,914
(People who are worse)

3120
01:42:22,114 --> 01:42:23,513
In retrospect,

3121
01:42:23,514 --> 01:42:25,743
I perfectly knew that it was "Upstream," not "Upriver."

3122
01:42:25,744 --> 01:42:26,744
- Really?
-  Yes.

3123
01:42:26,745 --> 01:42:27,914
- Really?
-  I knew it right away.

3124
01:42:28,284 --> 01:42:30,653
When you're sitting in the back, the answer is so clear.

3125
01:42:30,654 --> 01:42:31,654
But when you're up...

3126
01:42:31,655 --> 01:42:32,854
- You can't remember.
-  You can't remember.

3127
01:42:33,924 --> 01:42:35,623
I still don't understand...

3128
01:42:35,624 --> 01:42:37,364
why Bo Gum omitted "Up."

3129
01:42:37,824 --> 01:42:39,363
I didn't expect him to say "Stream" instead of "Upstream."

3130
01:42:39,364 --> 01:42:40,493
My head...

3131
01:42:40,494 --> 01:42:41,934
- Was it a pop song?
-  My head...

3132
01:42:42,394 --> 01:42:43,663
My head went blank.

3133
01:42:43,664 --> 01:42:44,864
(They still don't understand.)

3134
01:42:45,034 --> 01:42:47,634
Tchaikovsky was something else.

3135
01:42:48,034 --> 01:42:49,774
I confused it with probiotics.

3136
01:42:50,874 --> 01:42:52,304
But probiotics...

3137
01:42:52,574 --> 01:42:53,774
I sat in the back and watched.

3138
01:42:54,214 --> 01:42:56,114
Jung Bong was standing the whole time.

3139
01:42:56,644 --> 01:42:59,144
When we had a five-minute break, I went upstairs...

3140
01:42:59,584 --> 01:43:01,254
and looked up "Tchaikovsky probiotics."

3141
01:43:02,214 --> 01:43:04,084
I wanted to understand where I had messed up.

3142
01:43:05,124 --> 01:43:06,283
It was the highlight of the day.

3143
01:43:06,284 --> 01:43:07,453
The name of probiotics.

3144
01:43:07,454 --> 01:43:08,654
(It was the highlight of the day. The name of probiotics.)

3145
01:43:08,794 --> 01:43:09,823
Then...

3146
01:43:09,824 --> 01:43:10,863
The atmosphere is nice.

3147
01:43:10,864 --> 01:43:12,824
I thought of "Show Me the Money."

3148
01:43:13,024 --> 01:43:14,494
It feels like a retreat.

3149
01:43:14,534 --> 01:43:16,494
Now, the retreat has begun.

3150
01:43:17,764 --> 01:43:19,564
(No, the real game is beginning now.)

3151
01:43:20,134 --> 01:43:22,404
(The production crew moves busily.)

3152
01:43:24,374 --> 01:43:26,444
(They put mysterious items on the table.)

3153
01:43:28,544 --> 01:43:31,284
(They enter the room with the mysterious items.)

3154
01:43:32,114 --> 01:43:34,984
(What kind of a game will it be?)

3155
01:43:35,113 --> 01:43:37,073
(Next week)

3156
01:43:37,113 --> 01:43:40,953
This mission perfectly matches the dads' characters.

3157
01:43:41,013 --> 01:43:43,682
(Dad's mission!)

3158
01:43:43,683 --> 01:43:44,782
What does my family want?

3159
01:43:44,783 --> 01:43:45,953
(This one.)

3160
01:43:46,053 --> 01:43:47,992
My dad is the best at this.

3161
01:43:47,993 --> 01:43:49,352
Mountain rabbit

3162
01:43:49,353 --> 01:43:51,163
(What are you doing?)

3163
01:43:51,263 --> 01:43:52,593
Do I press this again?

3164
01:43:53,863 --> 01:43:58,202
(The 4 dads have a mysterious mission.)

3165
01:43:58,203 --> 01:43:59,532
- Dad, good luck.
-  Good luck.

3166
01:43:59,533 --> 01:44:00,663
Let's go, Supervisor!

3167
01:44:01,573 --> 01:44:04,443
(As dads struggle,)

3168
01:44:04,843 --> 01:44:07,002
(love blossoms in the families.)

3169
01:44:07,003 --> 01:44:08,613
(But it only lasts a day.)

3170
01:44:09,373 --> 01:44:13,682
(The mom and the son meet as enemies overnight.)

3171
01:44:13,683 --> 01:44:15,413
- You farty butt!
-  Correct.

3172
01:44:16,453 --> 01:44:20,853
(They desert their families for the Famous Line Quiz.)

3173
01:44:22,423 --> 01:44:25,422
(The son pops his veins to deliver a line passionately.)

3174
01:44:25,423 --> 01:44:27,433
(The mom denies it outright.)

3175
01:44:27,533 --> 01:44:28,662
He's your son.

3176
01:44:28,663 --> 01:44:29,833
(Go easy on him.)

3177
01:44:30,033 --> 01:44:31,033
How can love...

3178
01:44:31,033 --> 01:44:32,033
(My son, how can love...)

3179
01:44:32,034 --> 01:44:33,062
(Trembling)

3180
01:44:33,063 --> 01:44:34,273
Change?

3181
01:44:35,003 --> 01:44:36,402
(The changed love...)

3182
01:44:36,403 --> 01:44:37,573
(leaves the parents flustered.)

3183
01:44:37,703 --> 01:44:39,273
I feel dizzy.

3184
01:44:40,103 --> 01:44:42,542
(Ssangmun-dong that's about to explode is coming soon.)

3185
01:44:42,543 --> 01:44:44,643
(And...)

3186
01:44:46,583 --> 01:44:52,023
(Jin Ju who has grown up a lot in 10 years will come.)

3187
01:44:54,023 --> 01:45:00,492
(Jin Ju's surprise visit...)

3188
01:45:00,493 --> 01:45:07,673
(makes everyone tear up.)

3189
01:45:07,903 --> 01:45:09,472
I never imagined it.

3190
01:45:09,473 --> 01:45:13,543
(The last episode they never imagined is coming soon.)

3191
01:45:46,973 --> 01:45:48,143
(Congratulations on Reply 1988 10th Anniversary)

3192
01:45:50,173 --> 01:45:51,243
(Congratulations on Reply 1988 10th Anniversary)
