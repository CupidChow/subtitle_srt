7
00:00:37,353 --> 00:00:39,153
(Team Deok Sun was full of spirit.)

8
00:00:39,383 --> 00:00:40,483
(Screaming)

9
00:00:40,683 --> 00:00:41,753
(What?)

10
00:00:41,923 --> 00:00:44,493
(They did terribly because they could only scream.)

11
00:00:44,623 --> 00:00:46,563
(Team Taek and Sun Woo was full of confidence.)

12
00:00:46,763 --> 00:00:48,033
I don't know that one.

13
00:00:48,933 --> 00:00:49,962
Pass.

14
00:00:49,963 --> 00:00:52,463
(They did terribly because they couldn't even speak.)

15
00:00:53,033 --> 00:00:54,933
(Meanwhile, Team Jung Bong with Dong Hwi)

16
00:00:55,103 --> 00:00:56,472
(Charismatic)

17
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:58,103
- Chow Yun Fat!
- Correct.

18
00:00:58,343 --> 00:00:59,502
(Without saying a single word)

19
00:00:59,503 --> 00:01:00,573
(Correct)

20
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:01,712

(Points can be deducted.)

26
00:01:09,983 --> 00:01:13,553
(Music got played amidst silence.)

27
00:01:13,653 --> 00:01:14,752
- Let me answer.
- Go ahead.

(Points deducted)

32
00:01:22,533 --> 00:01:25,033

Let's eat.

41
00:01:40,043 --> 00:01:42,053
(The night at Ssangmun-dong begins now.)

42
00:01:42,383 --> 00:01:44,483
A video of Park Bo Gum opening a bottle of wine.

43
00:01:45,183 --> 00:01:46,752
- His nose is red already.
- I'll open it...

44
00:01:46,753 --> 00:01:49,029
- I'll open it so that it's tasty.
- I'll cook it so that it's tasty.

45
00:01:49,053 --> 00:01:50,693
Twist it. No.

46
00:01:50,753 --> 00:01:51,992
- Do you know what you're doing?
- Twist it.

47
00:01:51,993 --> 00:01:53,992
- That's right. You can take it out.
- Don't take it out.

48
00:01:53,993 --> 00:01:55,739
- You don't know how to do it.
- I'm nervous.

49
00:01:55,763 --> 00:01:58,003
- You don't know how to do it.
- It's okay. I'll try it.

50
00:01:59,003 --> 00:02:00,162
Oh, no.

51
00:02:00,163 --> 00:02:01,573
What a waste!

52
00:02:01,733 --> 00:02:04,133
- Give it to Mom first.
- Well done.

53
00:02:04,473 --> 00:02:06,073
- Thank you for the drink.
- Enjoy it.

54
00:02:07,173 --> 00:02:08,773
It smells great.

55
00:02:09,443 --> 00:02:10,772
- Let's clink our glasses.
- Okay.

56
00:02:10,773 --> 00:02:11,959
(Since the glasses are full, a toast is in order.)

57
00:02:11,983 --> 00:02:13,112
Let's go!

58
00:02:13,113 --> 00:02:16,853
- Reply 1988!
- Reply 1988!

59
00:02:17,713 --> 00:02:18,822
Bottoms up.

60
00:02:18,823 --> 00:02:19,883
"Bottoms up."

61
00:02:20,823 --> 00:02:22,553
- Just once.
- It's a film camera.

62
00:02:23,653 --> 00:02:25,092
(The Ssangmun-dong families put their faces together.)

63
00:02:25,093 --> 00:02:26,993
One, two, three.

64
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:32,503
When are we playing the next games?

65
00:02:33,103 --> 00:02:34,103
Sun Young.

66
00:02:34,103 --> 00:02:35,103
(Laughing)

67
00:02:35,104 --> 00:02:37,903
- Sun Young is a game addict.
- She's addicted to games.

68
00:02:38,043 --> 00:02:39,302
- Sun Young is a game addict.
- I didn't know this, but...

69
00:02:39,303 --> 00:02:40,872
- Games are fun, right?
- I'm competitive.

70
00:02:40,873 --> 00:02:42,712
That's right. You got on your knees a lot.

71
00:02:42,713 --> 00:02:43,772
I'm competitive.

72
00:02:43,773 --> 00:02:46,293
- You got on your knees six times.
- I'm not usually like that.

73
00:02:46,343 --> 00:02:48,383
Do you know what Jae Myung said earlier?

74
00:02:48,453 --> 00:02:49,853
"Dong Il,"

75
00:02:50,013 --> 00:02:51,353
"I'm so dizzy right now."

76
00:02:52,183 --> 00:02:53,483
(Squeezing his eyes shut)

77
00:02:53,623 --> 00:02:56,192
- My heart rate kept going up.
- Really?

78
00:02:56,193 --> 00:02:57,673
I got a cramp in the back of my head.

79
00:02:57,923 --> 00:02:59,392
I became angry when I couldn't answer correctly.

80
00:02:59,393 --> 00:03:01,369
(I became angry when I couldn't answer correctly.)

81
00:03:01,393 --> 00:03:02,762
- You couldn't even open your mouth.
- No.

82
00:03:02,763 --> 00:03:03,763
I became so angry.

83
00:03:03,764 --> 00:03:06,303
I've never seen anyone become so angry on a variety show.

84
00:03:07,433 --> 00:03:09,102
- Jae Myung, you did well...
- Yes, Dong Il?

85
00:03:09,103 --> 00:03:10,173
Despite the headache.

86
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:14,042
(The conversation deepens, )

87
00:03:14,043 --> 00:03:19,883
(but the table becomes empty.)

88
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:21,953
Shall I cook some ramyeon?

89
00:03:22,653 --> 00:03:24,012
I want a bite as well.

90
00:03:24,013 --> 00:03:25,323
(She wants more food.)

91
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:26,652
Is this the first one?

92
00:03:26,653 --> 00:03:28,192
(Meanwhile, the group in black looks serious.)

93
00:03:28,193 --> 00:03:29,193
There are three bottles.

94
00:03:29,194 --> 00:03:30,834
Three bottles? Shall we open all of them?

95
00:03:31,223 --> 00:03:32,393
Not this one.

96
00:03:32,563 --> 00:03:34,362
Let's go with this one for now.

97
00:03:34,363 --> 00:03:35,463
- Ramyeon.
- Here.

98
00:03:35,593 --> 00:03:38,733
Let me give you a sneak peek of today's schedule.

99
00:03:39,133 --> 00:03:41,203
You can eat freely...

100
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:43,973
and enjoy conversing with each other.

101
00:03:44,273 --> 00:03:45,903
But as you do that...

102
00:03:46,503 --> 00:03:47,503
Don't be like that.

103
00:03:47,504 --> 00:03:49,243
We have it good right now.

104
00:03:49,573 --> 00:03:52,182
But you might think, "I want to drink nice liquor."

105
00:03:52,183 --> 00:03:54,013
(I want to drink nice liquor.)

106
00:03:54,113 --> 00:03:55,382
- There are prizes.
- Yes.

107
00:03:55,383 --> 00:03:56,853
"I want to eat something nice."

108
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:59,382
- I want to do that.
- "I want some 30-year-old liquor."

109
00:03:59,383 --> 00:04:00,522
What was that?

110
00:04:00,523 --> 00:04:02,092
- "Some 30-year-old liquor." - "I want..."

111
00:04:02,093 --> 00:04:03,953
- "some 30-year-old liquor." - Okay.

112
00:04:04,523 --> 00:04:07,192
Shall I explain what prizes there are?

113
00:04:07,193 --> 00:04:08,663
- Yes!
- Yes!

114
00:04:08,763 --> 00:04:10,762
You could take a look at the goods...

115
00:04:10,763 --> 00:04:12,602
and decide to enjoy the night without them.

116
00:04:12,603 --> 00:04:13,702
"You could take a look at the goods."

117
00:04:13,703 --> 00:04:15,002
Let's do that.

118
00:04:15,003 --> 00:04:16,443
(Yeong Seok, let me see your cards.)

119
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:19,473
(The production crew moves busily before revealing the prizes.)

120
00:04:22,643 --> 00:04:23,972
Will we drink all of them?

121
00:04:23,973 --> 00:04:25,913
Aren't they too much?

122
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:28,282
The first prize.

123
00:04:28,283 --> 00:04:29,913
(What will be the first prize?)

124
00:04:29,953 --> 00:04:31,922
It's a famous and expensive Chinese liquor,

125
00:04:31,923 --> 00:04:33,322
- baijiu.
- Baijiu.

126
00:04:33,323 --> 00:04:35,652
In the drama, there was a scene where you drank it in secret...

127
00:04:35,653 --> 00:04:36,752
since it was very valuable.

128
00:04:36,753 --> 00:04:38,162
- It was what Taek brought home.
- That's right.

129
00:04:38,163 --> 00:04:39,322
- That's right.
- Taek...

130
00:04:39,323 --> 00:04:41,393
brought it home after competing...

131
00:04:41,663 --> 00:04:44,093
in a go competition in China.

132
00:04:45,733 --> 00:04:49,873
(The day of Taek's return home and birthday party)

133
00:04:50,403 --> 00:04:55,143
(Without congratulating him, they went through Taek's bag.)

134
00:04:55,813 --> 00:04:58,213
(It was Chinese baijiu!)

135
00:04:58,783 --> 00:05:01,412
(They got drunk in the end.)

136
00:05:01,413 --> 00:05:05,653
(It's a hard liquor children shouldn't drink.)

137
00:05:06,683 --> 00:05:07,753
What's this?

138
00:05:07,783 --> 00:05:09,753
We're out of alcohol already.

139
00:05:10,293 --> 00:05:12,893
(He became annoyed that the nice liquor was gone.)

140
00:05:13,163 --> 00:05:16,292
He only brought one bottle.

141
00:05:16,293 --> 00:05:18,233
It wasn't enough for all of us.

142
00:05:18,303 --> 00:05:21,133
(It's a precious liquor adults absolutely love.)

143
00:05:21,603 --> 00:05:23,083
We won't be able to go home tomorrow.

144
00:05:24,273 --> 00:05:26,803
(The first prize, Chinese baijiu that brings back memories)

145
00:05:27,003 --> 00:05:28,102
The second prize.

146
00:05:28,103 --> 00:05:29,243
(What's the second prize?)

147
00:05:29,343 --> 00:05:31,512
We bought three bottles of the same wine.

148
00:05:31,513 --> 00:05:32,583
What is it?

149
00:05:32,843 --> 00:05:34,142
Are we mixing all sorts of alcohol today?

150
00:05:34,143 --> 00:05:35,783
(The name is hard.)

151
00:05:35,883 --> 00:05:37,682
- Cabernet sauvignon.
- Chateau...

152
00:05:37,683 --> 00:05:38,752
It's a good wine.

153
00:05:38,753 --> 00:05:40,029
(In any case, it's a good wine.)

154
00:05:40,053 --> 00:05:41,493
But here's the important thing.

155
00:05:42,023 --> 00:05:45,023
- The vintage is 1988.
- It's from 1988.

156
00:05:45,623 --> 00:05:46,792
Really?

157
00:05:46,793 --> 00:05:48,733
(The old vintage impresses everyone.)

158
00:05:49,093 --> 00:05:50,432
Then we need to decant it.

159
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,733
Open it in advance.

160
00:05:52,433 --> 00:05:54,563
One bottle costs about 800 dollars.

161
00:05:56,303 --> 00:05:59,173
(The 2nd prize, 3 bottles of 1988 wine)

162
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:01,972
After drinking and conversing for a while,

163
00:06:01,973 --> 00:06:03,042
you could think, "I want a snack."

164
00:06:03,043 --> 00:06:04,442
I love it.

165
00:06:04,443 --> 00:06:05,742
"I want something refreshing."

166
00:06:05,743 --> 00:06:07,843
- You could think that.
- Are those mangoes?

167
00:06:08,013 --> 00:06:09,213
They look like plastic models.

168
00:06:10,113 --> 00:06:11,622
- I think they're plastic models.
- Are those plastic models?

169
00:06:11,623 --> 00:06:13,522
- They're real fruits.
- Really?

170
00:06:13,523 --> 00:06:15,653
- I have more of these.
- They're real fruits.

171
00:06:15,923 --> 00:06:17,963
(The third prize, A set of refreshing, real fruits)

172
00:06:18,323 --> 00:06:20,604
Let's say it's late at night and you want some more food.

173
00:06:21,393 --> 00:06:24,093
(That's what we're talking about.)

174
00:06:24,563 --> 00:06:26,763
(The last prize, Ramyeon that's a must at a retreat)

175
00:06:27,533 --> 00:06:30,803
These are four prizes.

176
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:33,303
Pick the prizes you want and try to win them.

177
00:06:33,503 --> 00:06:34,603
But...

178
00:06:35,073 --> 00:06:36,913
we need to know what kind of games we'll play.

179
00:06:36,943 --> 00:06:38,742
The last game...

180
00:06:38,743 --> 00:06:40,182
- that remains is...
- We've never been this serious.

181
00:06:40,183 --> 00:06:41,183
Liquor is on the line.

182
00:06:41,184 --> 00:06:42,352
Dads' Challenge.

183
00:06:42,353 --> 00:06:43,712
(Special Mission, Ssangmun-dong Dads' Challenge)

184
00:06:43,713 --> 00:06:44,812
Dads' Challenge.

185
00:06:44,813 --> 00:06:46,753
(Special Mission, Ssangmun-dong Dads' Challenge)

186
00:06:48,023 --> 00:06:52,693
(Special Mission, Ssangmun-dong Dads' Challenge)

187
00:06:52,823 --> 00:06:56,092
(Four Ssangmun-dong dads, Dong Il, Moo Sung, Jae Myung, and Sung Kyun, )

188
00:06:56,093 --> 00:07:00,403
(will take on a challenge for the prizes!)

189
00:07:00,933 --> 00:07:03,272
(The missions that perfectly suit...)

190
00:07:03,273 --> 00:07:06,103
(the dads' characters are ready.)

191
00:07:06,143 --> 00:07:07,823
- Is it related to the drama?
- Of course.

192
00:07:08,313 --> 00:07:09,413
Is it related to the drama?

193
00:07:10,073 --> 00:07:13,242
(4 dads will take on a different mission...)

194
00:07:13,243 --> 00:07:15,282
(and win the prize their families want!)

195
00:07:15,283 --> 00:07:16,752
(If they succeed in it, they'll get the prize they want.)

196
00:07:16,753 --> 00:07:18,633
(If they fail, the next dad will get a chance.)

197
00:07:19,483 --> 00:07:20,723
Father!

198
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:22,923
- What do you want?
- Father!

199
00:07:24,093 --> 00:07:25,723
(Determined)

200
00:07:25,793 --> 00:07:29,392
The children should decide on what they want to eat.

201
00:07:29,393 --> 00:07:30,763
Then we'll decide on the order.

202
00:07:31,433 --> 00:07:33,132
Dong Hwi, what do you want?

203
00:07:33,133 --> 00:07:36,632
- I want the 1988-vintagish wine.
- "Vintagish."

204
00:07:36,633 --> 00:07:38,802
Say it clearly.

205
00:07:38,803 --> 00:07:40,773
I want the 1988-vintage wine.

206
00:07:40,843 --> 00:07:42,312
- Okay.
- Wine.

207
00:07:42,313 --> 00:07:44,712
- The 1988-vintage wine?
- For the 1988-vintage wine,

208
00:07:44,713 --> 00:07:46,043
Sung Kyun will give it a go.

209
00:07:47,213 --> 00:07:49,113
- Oh, yes!
- Kim Sung Kyun!

210
00:07:49,253 --> 00:07:51,283
- Kim Sung Kyun!
- Did you see that?

211
00:07:51,923 --> 00:07:52,982
He's cool.

212
00:07:52,983 --> 00:07:54,543
- We need to go out there.
- Good luck.

213
00:07:54,923 --> 00:07:56,352
I'll let you drink the old-vintage wine.

214
00:07:56,353 --> 00:07:57,653
Let's go.

215
00:07:57,753 --> 00:08:00,123
(The first dad is determined.)

216
00:08:00,263 --> 00:08:02,592
- We believe in you.
- Kim Sung Kyun!

217
00:08:02,593 --> 00:08:04,963
- Father.
- Kim Sung Kyun!

218
00:08:06,933 --> 00:08:09,873
Min Ji, your father-in-law is trying so hard.

219
00:08:09,973 --> 00:08:11,032
Good luck!

220
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:12,679
(She gets a scolding from her mother-in-law.)

221
00:08:12,703 --> 00:08:15,013
(My daughter-in-law is good.)

222
00:08:15,073 --> 00:08:17,613
In this group, who has the youngest style?

223
00:08:18,413 --> 00:08:20,513
- Hye Ri.
- Hye Ri, come on out.

224
00:08:20,683 --> 00:08:22,083
- I'm the youngest.
- It suits her.

225
00:08:22,253 --> 00:08:23,653
- Hye Ri, come on out.
- Okay.

226
00:08:24,353 --> 00:08:25,852
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

227
00:08:25,853 --> 00:08:28,282
- President Kim.
- President Sung.

228
00:08:28,283 --> 00:08:30,152
- It's so good to see you.
- Good to see you.

229
00:08:30,153 --> 00:08:31,322
- Good to see you.
- Hurry up.

230
00:08:31,323 --> 00:08:32,362
- Good to see you.
- Stop it.

231
00:08:32,363 --> 00:08:33,722
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

232
00:08:33,723 --> 00:08:34,723
Hurry up and do it.

233
00:08:34,724 --> 00:08:35,932
(The partners finally do the greeting.)

234
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:37,092
- All right.
- The mission is out.

235
00:08:37,093 --> 00:08:38,762
The mission comes from this scene.

236
00:08:38,763 --> 00:08:40,832
- That's right.
- In the drama,

237
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:42,272
- Kim Sung Kyun...
- Yes.

238
00:08:42,273 --> 00:08:43,902
Is absorbed in copying the catchphrases...

239
00:08:43,903 --> 00:08:46,573
- from "Gag Concert." - That's right.

240
00:08:49,113 --> 00:08:51,683
(Let us tell you about Jung Bong's dad.)

241
00:08:52,443 --> 00:08:53,912
(Name: Kim Sung Kyun Job: President...)

242
00:08:53,913 --> 00:08:55,582
(of Goldstar Electronics branch, but practically jobless)

243
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:59,223
(Talent: Analyzing and copying catchphrases)

244
00:09:01,153 --> 00:09:03,522
(Lethal move 1, "Excuse, cuse me...")

245
00:09:03,523 --> 00:09:06,023
(from "Fan Guru" of "Humor No. 1")

246
00:09:08,323 --> 00:09:11,062
(Lethal move 2, "Sungguri dang dang...")

247
00:09:11,063 --> 00:09:13,933
(from "Fortune-Telling Restaurant" of "Hurrah for the Youth")

248
00:09:14,563 --> 00:09:17,473
(And we can't miss Sung Kyun's best move.)

249
00:09:17,533 --> 00:09:19,702
President Sung.

250
00:09:19,703 --> 00:09:22,673
Gosh, President Kim.

251
00:09:23,073 --> 00:09:25,212
(Favorite lethal move, "It's so good to see you...")

252
00:09:25,213 --> 00:09:27,783
(from "Bukcheong Water Seller" of "Humor No. 1")

253
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:30,212
(What will be the game for Jung Bong's dad, )

254
00:09:30,213 --> 00:09:31,853
(the copying machine of catchphrases?)

255
00:09:32,523 --> 00:09:33,752
Now...

256
00:09:33,753 --> 00:09:34,883
You'll get the hambugi meme.

257
00:09:35,023 --> 00:09:38,962
How well do you know the modern short forms...

258
00:09:38,963 --> 00:09:41,363
- and catchphrases?
- It'll be hard.

259
00:09:41,523 --> 00:09:42,692
(Sung Kyun's challenge:)

260
00:09:42,693 --> 00:09:43,869
(Guess the meaning of modern catchphrases and short forms)

261
00:09:43,893 --> 00:09:45,562
When Hye Ri shows you one,

262
00:09:45,563 --> 00:09:46,962
explain the meaning...

263
00:09:46,963 --> 00:09:49,702
and I'll yell either "Correct" or "Wrong."

264
00:09:49,703 --> 00:09:51,503
There'll be ten questions.

265
00:09:51,773 --> 00:09:53,242
- Ten?
- How many correct answers?

266
00:09:53,243 --> 00:09:54,473
Among ten questions,

267
00:09:54,673 --> 00:09:56,373
- answer five correctly...
- Okay.

268
00:09:56,643 --> 00:09:58,283
- to succeed in the mission.
- Good luck.

269
00:09:59,143 --> 00:10:00,383
At home,

270
00:10:00,743 --> 00:10:02,613
I have children in middle school.

271
00:10:03,253 --> 00:10:05,723
(We're set!)

272
00:10:05,783 --> 00:10:08,123
But here's the important thing. We don't talk much.

273
00:10:09,623 --> 00:10:11,693
(This dad can relate.)

274
00:10:12,023 --> 00:10:13,993
That's so funny.

275
00:10:14,423 --> 00:10:15,792
But the questions are mixed.

276
00:10:15,793 --> 00:10:17,562
- You'd know...
- Okay.

277
00:10:17,563 --> 00:10:18,763
Some of them.

278
00:10:18,933 --> 00:10:20,762
- Shall we begin?
- Maybe I'll do too well.

279
00:10:20,763 --> 00:10:22,103
Among ten questions...

280
00:10:22,203 --> 00:10:23,332
Don't get ahead of yourself.

281
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:24,573
Really? Okay.

282
00:10:25,473 --> 00:10:26,503
Get ready.

283
00:10:26,803 --> 00:10:28,302
- Start.
- I can do it.

284
00:10:28,303 --> 00:10:29,412
(The game begins.)

285
00:10:29,413 --> 00:10:30,873
Start.

286
00:10:31,143 --> 00:10:32,382
(BBCC)

287
00:10:32,383 --> 00:10:34,543
- BBCC.
- What is it?

288
00:10:34,643 --> 00:10:35,952
It's so easy.

289
00:10:35,953 --> 00:10:37,282
- Explain it.
- What is it? I don't know.

290
00:10:37,283 --> 00:10:39,283
See? He doesn't talk to his children.

291
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:41,952
No one knows.

292
00:10:41,953 --> 00:10:43,793
(Bermuda Triangle)

293
00:10:43,853 --> 00:10:45,453
I bet he doesn't know what B stands for.

294
00:10:45,723 --> 00:10:47,493
- Best.
- Best.

295
00:10:48,123 --> 00:10:49,192
No.

296
00:10:49,193 --> 00:10:50,262
(Don't go in that direction.)

297
00:10:50,263 --> 00:10:52,303
- Best of the best.
- Best of the best.

298
00:10:53,503 --> 00:10:54,602
Car of the cars?

299
00:10:54,603 --> 00:10:56,102
- Bias?
- I don't know.

300
00:10:56,103 --> 00:10:57,802
Best of the best.

301
00:10:57,803 --> 00:10:59,203
(The youngsters don't know either.)

302
00:10:59,473 --> 00:11:00,842
What is it? I don't know.

303
00:11:00,843 --> 00:11:02,049
(Jung Bong and his wife don't know either.)

304
00:11:02,073 --> 00:11:04,172
- Wrong. You don't know.
- What is it?

305
00:11:04,173 --> 00:11:05,983
- It's impossible.
- Next question.

306
00:11:06,243 --> 00:11:07,912
- You know this one.
- I know this one.

307
00:11:07,913 --> 00:11:09,912
- My goodness.
- You know this one.

308
00:11:09,913 --> 00:11:11,083
- I know this one.
- Yes.

309
00:11:11,113 --> 00:11:13,152
Iced Americano even if I freeze to death.

310
00:11:13,153 --> 00:11:14,599
(Iced Americano even if I freeze to death)

311
00:11:14,623 --> 00:11:15,792
(Congratulations on the first correct answer.)

312
00:11:15,793 --> 00:11:16,892
Correct.

313
00:11:16,893 --> 00:11:18,692
- It's an easy one.
- I know this one.

314
00:11:18,693 --> 00:11:20,162
On your own, do it well...

315
00:11:20,163 --> 00:11:22,332
(On your own, do it well...)

316
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:23,333
What?

317
00:11:23,863 --> 00:11:25,462
- It's correct.
- On your own, do it well,

318
00:11:25,463 --> 00:11:27,602
- It's correct.
- cleanly, and sensibly.

319
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:28,603
Correct.

320
00:11:28,733 --> 00:11:30,032
(The youngest dad answers well, cleanly, and sensibly!)

321
00:11:30,033 --> 00:11:31,033
Oh, yes.

322
00:11:31,034 --> 00:11:32,342
- He knows that one.
- I see.

323
00:11:32,343 --> 00:11:34,103
I bought it with my own money and...

324
00:11:34,343 --> 00:11:36,243
(Halting for the 2nd time)

325
00:11:36,413 --> 00:11:38,172
An item I bought with my own money.

326
00:11:38,173 --> 00:11:39,283
- Correct.
- Correct.

327
00:11:39,683 --> 00:11:41,113
He's good.

328
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:42,612
(The fifth keyword: Goal aesthetics)

329
00:11:42,613 --> 00:11:43,883
Goal... It's...

330
00:11:44,283 --> 00:11:47,482
the ideal I want to be.

331
00:11:47,483 --> 00:11:49,252
- Correct.
- Okay.

332
00:11:49,253 --> 00:11:50,253
Four.

333
00:11:50,254 --> 00:11:52,239
You'll succeed in it if you get one more question right.

334
00:11:52,263 --> 00:11:53,992
- NAC?
- Shall we go?

335
00:11:53,993 --> 00:11:55,662
- Shall we go?
- Shall we go?

336
00:11:55,663 --> 00:11:57,032
- Shall we go?
- Shall we go?

337
00:11:57,033 --> 00:11:58,033
I know.

338
00:11:58,463 --> 00:11:59,663
Nice atmosphere...

339
00:11:59,703 --> 00:12:01,362
(That's right, Father.)

340
00:12:01,363 --> 00:12:03,233
- to take out a card?
- Wrong!

341
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:05,403
- Next one.
- No.

342
00:12:05,843 --> 00:12:07,542
Nice and atmospheric cafe.

343
00:12:07,543 --> 00:12:09,573
- Nice and atmospheric cafe.
- FG.

344
00:12:09,773 --> 00:12:10,773
Fully good.

345
00:12:11,673 --> 00:12:12,743
Wrong!

346
00:12:13,213 --> 00:12:14,513
(What's the answer?)

347
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:16,253
- Feel-good.
- Feel-good.

348
00:12:16,553 --> 00:12:18,273
- Just get one more question.
- This one...

349
00:12:18,313 --> 00:12:19,783
Bo Gum will do it tomorrow morning.

350
00:12:20,253 --> 00:12:21,893
Bo Gum will do it tomorrow morning.

351
00:12:22,593 --> 00:12:24,753
(Mr. Kim, please.)

352
00:12:24,923 --> 00:12:26,422
Running on a rainy day.

353
00:12:26,423 --> 00:12:27,463
- Okay!
- Correct.

354
00:12:27,693 --> 00:12:29,409
(He succeeds in it with over 30 seconds remaining.)

355
00:12:29,433 --> 00:12:30,692
- No way.
- All right.

356
00:12:30,693 --> 00:12:31,693
You got five correct answers.

357
00:12:31,694 --> 00:12:32,762
- Success.
- Okay.

358
00:12:32,763 --> 00:12:33,939
(Jung Bong's dad succeeds in the mission.)

359
00:12:33,963 --> 00:12:37,302
- Kim Sung Kyun!
- Kim Sung Kyun!

360
00:12:37,303 --> 00:12:39,443
- Kim Sung Kyun!
- Kim Sung Kyun!

361
00:12:39,903 --> 00:12:42,213
- Congratulations.
- Do you know what that is?

362
00:12:42,443 --> 00:12:43,512
- What's that?
- What's that?

363
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:44,542
- BBCC.
- How many bottles will we get?

364
00:12:44,543 --> 00:12:45,682
- Three?
- Guess the meaning.

365
00:12:45,683 --> 00:12:47,282
Sung Dong Il, guess the meaning.

366
00:12:47,283 --> 00:12:48,343
- What's that?
- BBCC.

367
00:12:49,253 --> 00:12:51,083
I know what "Tsk-tsk" is.

368
00:12:51,283 --> 00:12:52,753
- Mi Ran.
- What?

369
00:12:53,553 --> 00:12:54,633
- Do you know?
- It's hard.

370
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:56,192
Choi Soo Jong.

371
00:12:56,193 --> 00:12:57,869
(Choi Soo Jong has nothing to do with it.)

372
00:12:57,893 --> 00:13:00,322
- Is it correct?
- Che Si Ra.

373
00:13:00,323 --> 00:13:01,692
- Choi...
- No.

374
00:13:01,693 --> 00:13:03,132
- Choiza.
- I see.

375
00:13:03,133 --> 00:13:04,263
Cha In Pyo. Cha Si Ra.

376
00:13:04,733 --> 00:13:06,202
- Who's Cha Si Ra?
- Who's Cha Si Ra?

377
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:07,403
Who's Cha Si Ra?

378
00:13:07,463 --> 00:13:08,802
Park Bo Gum, what's this?

379
00:13:08,803 --> 00:13:09,832
Bo Gum.

380
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:10,902
I don't know either.

381
00:13:10,903 --> 00:13:12,972
Does no one know?

382
00:13:12,973 --> 00:13:14,242
- Bias...
- Don't you know?

383
00:13:14,243 --> 00:13:16,413
(No one knows! We'll reveal the answer.)

384
00:13:16,443 --> 00:13:17,872
(Answer: A bias is a bias, but Cha Eun Woo is Cha Eun Woo.)

385
00:13:17,873 --> 00:13:20,383
(It means Cha Eun Woo is that charming.)

386
00:13:20,613 --> 00:13:21,643
A bias...

387
00:13:22,313 --> 00:13:23,413
(That's right.)

388
00:13:23,653 --> 00:13:25,982
- A bias is a bias.
- A bias is a bias,

389
00:13:25,983 --> 00:13:27,383
but a conversion is a conversion.

390
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:29,552
- A close 2nd is a close 2nd.
- You're close.

391
00:13:29,553 --> 00:13:31,392
- A close 2nd is a close 2nd.
- The best is Choi Soo Jong,

392
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:33,563
but the close second is Cha In Pyo.

393
00:13:34,423 --> 00:13:36,632
- My goodness. Correct.
- Correct.

394
00:13:36,633 --> 00:13:37,862
- It's the same thing.
- Is it wrong?

395
00:13:37,863 --> 00:13:39,632
- It's something like that.
- It's something like that.

396
00:13:39,633 --> 00:13:41,972
A bias is a bias,

397
00:13:41,973 --> 00:13:43,633
but a close second is Cha Eun Woo.

398
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:44,903
No.

399
00:13:45,643 --> 00:13:47,172
A bias is a bias,

400
00:13:47,173 --> 00:13:49,242
- but Cha Eun Woo is Cha Eun Woo.
- Come on. It's Park Bo Gum.

401
00:13:49,243 --> 00:13:50,772
Change it to BBCP.

402
00:13:50,773 --> 00:13:52,683
(She roots for Bo Gum.)

403
00:13:52,783 --> 00:13:54,882
- Is it BBCB then?
- CP.

404
00:13:54,883 --> 00:13:56,253
CP.

405
00:13:56,383 --> 00:13:57,552
The bias is Park Bo Gum,

406
00:13:57,553 --> 00:13:59,723
- the close second is Park Bo Gum.
- BBCP.

407
00:13:59,783 --> 00:14:01,552
- Thank you.
- The close second is Park Bo Gum.

408
00:14:01,553 --> 00:14:03,552
The bias is Park Bo Gum, the close second is Park Bo Gum.

409
00:14:03,553 --> 00:14:04,752
Congratulations.

410
00:14:04,753 --> 00:14:06,199
(He returns in glory with the old-vintage wine.)

411
00:14:06,223 --> 00:14:08,933
Thank you. Let's put it here.

412
00:14:09,033 --> 00:14:10,592
Let's hurry up and decant it.

413
00:14:10,593 --> 00:14:11,833
We can't drink it right away.

414
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,662
She's excited.

415
00:14:13,663 --> 00:14:15,062
- Calm down.
- Sun Young, you're drooling.

416
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:17,102
- Let me take a photo.
- Nineteen eighty-eight.

417
00:14:17,103 --> 00:14:18,602
It's from 1988.

418
00:14:18,603 --> 00:14:19,743
Is it white wine?

419
00:14:19,943 --> 00:14:21,973
- I think it's red.
- Then...

420
00:14:22,113 --> 00:14:24,843
Let me take a look. Gosh, it's so fascinating.

421
00:14:25,213 --> 00:14:27,913
(She takes a photo of the father-in-law's gift.)

422
00:14:28,183 --> 00:14:30,482
Who will be...

423
00:14:30,483 --> 00:14:31,752
- the next player?
- So...

424
00:14:31,753 --> 00:14:33,182
either Dong Il or Moo Sung.

425
00:14:33,183 --> 00:14:34,583
Who will go next?

426
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,192
Moo Sung, go next.

427
00:14:36,193 --> 00:14:37,823
Do you want me to play that game?

428
00:14:37,953 --> 00:14:38,992
- No.
- A different game.

429
00:14:38,993 --> 00:14:40,992
- A different game.
- Don't all four dads need to go?

430
00:14:40,993 --> 00:14:42,939
- You'll need to go anyway.
- I didn't know a single one.

431
00:14:42,963 --> 00:14:44,062
All right.

432
00:14:44,063 --> 00:14:45,632
(2nd player: Choi Moo Sung)

433
00:14:45,633 --> 00:14:47,262
- Oh, yes.
- Taek's dad.

434
00:14:47,263 --> 00:14:48,832
- I don't know what I'm doing.
- Choi Moo Sung!

435
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:51,072
What was your job in the drama?

436
00:14:51,073 --> 00:14:53,102
- He ran a jewelry store.
- A jewelry store.

437
00:14:53,103 --> 00:14:54,472
What do you sell at a jewelry store?

438
00:14:54,473 --> 00:14:55,972
- Gold.
- Gold.

439
00:14:55,973 --> 00:14:57,872
- Silver. Watches.
- That's right.

440
00:14:57,873 --> 00:14:59,282
- Watches.
- Watches.

441
00:14:59,283 --> 00:15:00,682
(Many jewelry stores sell gold, silver, and watches.)

442
00:15:00,683 --> 00:15:01,683
- All right.
- I'm nervous.

443
00:15:01,684 --> 00:15:03,682
- Stop the clock at the right time.
- Stop it at the right time.

444
00:15:03,683 --> 00:15:05,499
(The clock enters as soon as he finishes talking.)

445
00:15:05,523 --> 00:15:07,953
It's something Moo Sung is the best at!

446
00:15:08,353 --> 00:15:09,792
What is it?

447
00:15:09,793 --> 00:15:11,393
- Guess the time.
- A round of applause.

448
00:15:11,593 --> 00:15:13,162
(Icon of Optimism gives him courage.)

449
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:14,393
Icon of Optimism.

450
00:15:14,823 --> 00:15:17,993
He sold watches at Bonghwangdang all his life...

451
00:15:18,193 --> 00:15:20,902
and supported Bo Gum to become the best go player.

452
00:15:20,903 --> 00:15:23,072
- He's an incredible dad.
- That's right.

453
00:15:23,073 --> 00:15:25,443
Watches are his life.

454
00:15:26,473 --> 00:15:27,672
(Bonghwangdang)

455
00:15:27,673 --> 00:15:32,642
(Taek's dad was surrounded by watches...)

456
00:15:32,643 --> 00:15:37,283
(day and night.)

457
00:15:38,053 --> 00:15:40,952
(Although he didn't get any customers, )

458
00:15:40,953 --> 00:15:44,153
(he always manned the store.)

459
00:15:44,523 --> 00:15:47,623
(He protected Bonghwangdang at all times.)

460
00:15:48,523 --> 00:15:51,263
Thus, we'll celebrate...

461
00:15:51,463 --> 00:15:52,963
Reply 1988...

462
00:15:53,103 --> 00:15:55,473
by stopping the clock at 19.88 seconds.

463
00:15:56,403 --> 00:15:58,603
(Moo Sung's challenge: Stop the clock at 19.88 seconds)

464
00:15:59,243 --> 00:16:01,572
Going down to the centiseconds is a bit too much.

465
00:16:01,573 --> 00:16:03,019
(She becomes pessimistic right away.)

466
00:16:03,043 --> 00:16:04,572
It'll be too hard.

467
00:16:04,573 --> 00:16:06,812
It'll be too hard. Thus, we'll count it as a success...

468
00:16:06,813 --> 00:16:08,282
if it's between 19 and 20 seconds.

469
00:16:08,283 --> 00:16:09,382
Okay.

470
00:16:09,383 --> 00:16:10,629
(They'll count it as a success if it's between 19 and 20 seconds.)

471
00:16:10,653 --> 00:16:12,682
At 19 seconds...

472
00:16:12,683 --> 00:16:14,752
The centiseconds don't matter.

473
00:16:14,753 --> 00:16:16,433
- Really?
- The centiseconds don't matter.

474
00:16:16,493 --> 00:16:19,293
- Stop it at ten seconds as a test.
- It's hard.

475
00:16:19,863 --> 00:16:21,923
(A practice round)

476
00:16:22,493 --> 00:16:25,703
(Will he be able to stop it at 10 seconds?)

477
00:16:25,963 --> 00:16:27,462
(Mumbling)

478
00:16:27,463 --> 00:16:28,703
(Hitting)

479
00:16:29,233 --> 00:16:30,902
(He hits the button with confidence.)

480
00:16:30,903 --> 00:16:32,202
- It's 8 seconds.
- It's 8.08 seconds.

481
00:16:32,203 --> 00:16:33,672
I was too fast.

482
00:16:33,673 --> 00:16:34,902
(Chuckling)

483
00:16:34,903 --> 00:16:36,613
(Disappointing, encouraging)

484
00:16:36,643 --> 00:16:38,143
You got a sense of it, right?

485
00:16:38,673 --> 00:16:40,382
What do you mean?

486
00:16:40,383 --> 00:16:41,383
I...

487
00:16:41,384 --> 00:16:42,412
- I was too fast.
- I see.

488
00:16:42,413 --> 00:16:43,912
- He was too impatient.
- I thought he meant the clock.

489
00:16:43,913 --> 00:16:45,412
- The clock wasn't too fast.
- Practice.

490
00:16:45,413 --> 00:16:47,083
Moo Sung, pick a prize.

491
00:16:47,723 --> 00:16:49,052
- Maotai.
- What does my team want?

492
00:16:49,053 --> 00:16:50,093
Baijiu.

493
00:16:50,393 --> 00:16:51,393
Maotai.

494
00:16:51,493 --> 00:16:52,493
Maotai? Okay.

495
00:16:52,494 --> 00:16:53,722
He'll play for Maotai.

496
00:16:53,723 --> 00:16:55,039
(He picks baijiu as his children want.)

497
00:16:55,063 --> 00:16:56,692
You can start when you're ready.

498
00:16:56,693 --> 00:16:59,332
- Press once to start.
- Okay.

499
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:01,103
Press once more to stop.

500
00:17:01,203 --> 00:17:03,202
- If I could run through time - The clock wasn't too fast.

501
00:17:03,203 --> 00:17:06,643
(And become an adult)

502
00:17:07,043 --> 00:17:09,373
When you're ready, please say, "Here I go!"

503
00:17:10,373 --> 00:17:11,672
- Here I go!
- Let's go!

504
00:17:11,673 --> 00:17:12,683
Good luck!

505
00:17:13,143 --> 00:17:14,143
Let's go!

506
00:17:15,513 --> 00:17:17,453
(He starts.)

507
00:17:17,883 --> 00:17:20,153
(Time begins to flow.)

508
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,723
It's slower than you think.

509
00:17:22,593 --> 00:17:24,893
(It's more nerve-racking to watch.)

510
00:17:25,493 --> 00:17:28,323
(Taek's dad focuses calmly.)

511
00:17:28,933 --> 00:17:31,793
(Hye Young helps with the rhythm by bobbing her head.)

512
00:17:33,533 --> 00:17:35,833
(The father and the daughter are in sync.)

513
00:17:36,203 --> 00:17:37,903
(8 seconds have passed.)

514
00:17:38,033 --> 00:17:39,102
Nine.

515
00:17:39,103 --> 00:17:40,902
(He's a bit fast, but the difference is slight!)

516
00:17:40,903 --> 00:17:42,473
You have a long way to go.

517
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:45,143
Not yet.

518
00:17:46,543 --> 00:17:47,623
It's slower than you think.

519
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:50,483
(17 seconds have passed.)

520
00:17:50,883 --> 00:17:53,723
(As it approaches 19 seconds, the spectators get nervous.)

521
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,892
Now!

522
00:17:56,893 --> 00:17:58,493
(The mission ends.)

523
00:17:59,163 --> 00:18:02,193
(What's the meaning of their smiles?)

524
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:04,562
- It's 20.86 seconds.
- He made it.

525
00:18:04,563 --> 00:18:06,302
- I went over the time.
- You failed.

526
00:18:06,303 --> 00:18:07,463
- Why?
- He failed.

527
00:18:07,663 --> 00:18:09,772
- Between 19 and 20 seconds, right?
- It's hard.

528
00:18:09,773 --> 00:18:11,549
- He didn't reach 21 seconds.
- I went over the time.

529
00:18:11,573 --> 00:18:12,742
- I'm sorry.
- Between 19 and 20 seconds.

530
00:18:12,743 --> 00:18:15,102
Exactly. You said it should be between 19 and 20 seconds.

531
00:18:15,103 --> 00:18:16,913
You should've said 21 seconds or under.

532
00:18:17,113 --> 00:18:18,242
- Between 19 and 20 seconds.
- That's right.

533
00:18:18,243 --> 00:18:20,712
- So 20.86 seconds should count.
- You didn't say it correctly.

534
00:18:20,713 --> 00:18:21,883
(3 minutes ago)

535
00:18:22,313 --> 00:18:23,782
We'll count it as a success if it's between 19 and 20 seconds.

536
00:18:23,783 --> 00:18:24,883
Okay.

537
00:18:26,183 --> 00:18:27,222
At 19 seconds...

538
00:18:27,223 --> 00:18:29,252
The centiseconds don't matter.

539
00:18:29,253 --> 00:18:30,323
- Yes.
- Really?

540
00:18:30,423 --> 00:18:32,943
- So 20.86 seconds should count.
- You didn't say it correctly.

541
00:18:33,263 --> 00:18:35,062
(Cheering)

542
00:18:35,063 --> 00:18:36,133
I mean...

543
00:18:36,293 --> 00:18:37,493
Thank you.

544
00:18:37,733 --> 00:18:40,002
You said the centiseconds didn't matter.

545
00:18:40,003 --> 00:18:41,832
- So 20 seconds should count.
- It's below 21 seconds.

546
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:43,432
You said it was between 19 and 20 seconds.

547
00:18:43,433 --> 00:18:44,872
You said the centiseconds didn't matter.

548
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:46,872
- It's below 21 seconds.
- That's right.

549
00:18:46,873 --> 00:18:48,173
The conscience of the era.

550
00:18:48,273 --> 00:18:50,873
- The conscience of the era.
- Bo Gum, please get up.

551
00:18:51,273 --> 00:18:52,919
- The conscience of the era.
- That's right.

552
00:18:52,943 --> 00:18:54,342
- So...
- What's right?

553
00:18:54,343 --> 00:18:55,682
You said it was...

554
00:18:55,683 --> 00:18:57,089
- between 19 and 20 seconds.
- You said that.

555
00:18:57,113 --> 00:18:59,253
- Then 20 seconds should count.
- That's right.

556
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:02,693
If you're upset about it, let Bo Gum give it a go.

557
00:19:02,823 --> 00:19:04,352
- Then it'll be clean.
- He's the son.

558
00:19:04,353 --> 00:19:06,292
- The son's challenge.
- The son's challenge.

559
00:19:06,293 --> 00:19:07,492
- Let's go.
- The son's challenge.

560
00:19:07,493 --> 00:19:09,262
- You practiced.
- A revenge match.

561
00:19:09,263 --> 00:19:10,732
Bo Gum, let's go.

562
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:11,993
- Bo Gum can do it.
- Let's go.

563
00:19:12,903 --> 00:19:14,362
(Bonus player: Choi Moo Sung's son, Choi Taek)

564
00:19:14,363 --> 00:19:15,833
I bet Bo Gum will succeed in it.

565
00:19:16,303 --> 00:19:17,432
- I'll give it a go.
- Let's go.

566
00:19:17,433 --> 00:19:19,403
- Get ready.
- Play some background music.

567
00:19:19,503 --> 00:19:21,943
(I'm proud of you, my son!)

568
00:19:22,443 --> 00:19:24,342
- How many seconds?
- Here I go!

569
00:19:24,343 --> 00:19:25,512
- Good luck.
- Let's go.

570
00:19:25,513 --> 00:19:27,182
- The son's challenge.
- The son's challenge.

571
00:19:27,183 --> 00:19:28,489
(This time, he needs to stop it at 19 seconds!)

572
00:19:28,513 --> 00:19:30,783
(The game starts.)

573
00:19:31,213 --> 00:19:33,653
(Ssangmun-dong's pride lies in Taek's hands.)

574
00:19:34,753 --> 00:19:37,853
(He closes his eyes and focuses.)

575
00:19:38,053 --> 00:19:40,323
He closed his eyes. Gosh, look at him.

576
00:19:42,193 --> 00:19:45,133
(Dong Il is bobbing his head again.)

577
00:19:45,593 --> 00:19:48,163
(It's as nerve-racking as a game of go.)

578
00:19:48,203 --> 00:19:50,233
- His hand is a bit low.
- Oh, my.

579
00:19:50,303 --> 00:19:52,473
(Taek counts the seconds with his hand!)

580
00:19:52,873 --> 00:19:54,642
(Good luck, my son!)

581
00:19:54,643 --> 00:19:56,373
(15 seconds have passed.)

582
00:19:56,613 --> 00:19:58,573
(He's nearing 19 seconds.)

583
00:19:59,343 --> 00:20:00,743
(He presses it!)

584
00:20:03,013 --> 00:20:04,082
(Taek did it!)

585
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:05,923
Oh, my!

586
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:07,982
(Some might think he won a game of janggi.)

587
00:20:07,983 --> 00:20:09,152
- What?
- For real?

588
00:20:09,153 --> 00:20:10,873
(Some might think he won a game of janggi.)

589
00:20:11,023 --> 00:20:12,422
- Park Bo Gum!
- Park Bo Gum!

590
00:20:12,423 --> 00:20:14,123
(The name echoing through Ssangmun-dong)

591
00:20:14,193 --> 00:20:15,663
- What?
- Park Bo Gum!

592
00:20:16,033 --> 00:20:18,292
(Park Bo Gum is the beast!)

593
00:20:18,293 --> 00:20:19,633
- Park Bo Gum!
- What was that?

594
00:20:19,803 --> 00:20:20,962
(While enjoying the victory to the fullest)

595
00:20:20,963 --> 00:20:22,802
- Hold on.
- Park Bo Gum!

596
00:20:22,803 --> 00:20:23,903
Wait.

597
00:20:24,233 --> 00:20:25,502
What's that? What happened?

598
00:20:25,503 --> 00:20:26,503
(Why stop celebrating?)

599
00:20:26,504 --> 00:20:27,572
Look at him.

600
00:20:27,573 --> 00:20:29,172
- What is that? Rice?
- Rice.

601
00:20:29,173 --> 00:20:30,742
Rice Bo Gum!

602
00:20:30,743 --> 00:20:32,343
- Rice Bo Gum!
- Rice Bo Gum!

603
00:20:32,483 --> 00:20:35,313
(Pieces of rice are stuck to his black top.)

604
00:20:35,383 --> 00:20:37,182
I thought it was part of the pattern.

605
00:20:37,183 --> 00:20:38,252
How did that happen?

606
00:20:38,253 --> 00:20:39,552
- Rice?
- I thought it was the design.

607
00:20:39,553 --> 00:20:40,623
How did rice get on him?

608
00:20:40,953 --> 00:20:41,953
- Gosh.
- Like a baby.

609
00:20:42,753 --> 00:20:43,792
Why did you have rice on you?

610
00:20:43,793 --> 00:20:44,852
Either way...

611
00:20:44,853 --> 00:20:47,692
- Why did he have rice on himself?
- To even turn rice into fashion.

612
00:20:47,693 --> 00:20:49,263
Bo Gum ate rice with his chest.

613
00:20:50,033 --> 00:20:51,192
Congratulations.

614
00:20:51,193 --> 00:20:52,903
- Thank you.
- Where did that come from?

615
00:20:52,963 --> 00:20:54,063
He did it.

616
00:20:54,733 --> 00:20:56,502
(Completed a collection of high-end drinks)

617
00:20:56,503 --> 00:20:57,932
- When did it get on me?
- Amazing.

618
00:20:57,933 --> 00:20:59,272
- Oh, dear.
- Do you have some in your hair?

619
00:20:59,273 --> 00:21:01,043
- Take them out quickly.
- I found some.

620
00:21:01,403 --> 00:21:02,442
There are some on both sides.

621
00:21:02,443 --> 00:21:03,842
How did you eat dinner?

622
00:21:03,843 --> 00:21:04,942
Are you even full?

623
00:21:04,943 --> 00:21:06,183
- Are you?
- Do you feel full?

624
00:21:06,383 --> 00:21:07,842
How did you eat your dinner?

625
00:21:07,843 --> 00:21:08,882
That's weird.

626
00:21:08,883 --> 00:21:10,359
- How did it get on me?
- Any wet wipes?

627
00:21:10,383 --> 00:21:13,282
Okay, the last...

628
00:21:13,283 --> 00:21:14,452
It's Jae Myung's turn.

629
00:21:14,453 --> 00:21:16,452
Ryu Jae Myung will need a bit of space.

630
00:21:16,453 --> 00:21:19,293
His game needs some good space.

631
00:21:19,493 --> 00:21:21,092
- Sung Dong Il will go first.
- Is that so?

632
00:21:21,093 --> 00:21:22,123
Let's go.

633
00:21:22,433 --> 00:21:23,692
Good luck.

634
00:21:23,693 --> 00:21:25,393
(3rd player: Sung Dong Il)

635
00:21:25,693 --> 00:21:27,763
(What's Dad Dong Il's game?)

636
00:21:28,033 --> 00:21:31,472
What is Sung Dong Il's praiseworthy job in the drama,

637
00:21:31,473 --> 00:21:32,873
Sung Deok Sun?

638
00:21:33,373 --> 00:21:34,402
What?

639
00:21:34,403 --> 00:21:35,519
What does your dad do for a living?

640
00:21:35,543 --> 00:21:37,243
- A bank clerk.
- A bank clerk.

641
00:21:38,013 --> 00:21:39,813
You know where my dad works, right?

642
00:21:40,643 --> 00:21:41,813
Hanil Bank.

643
00:21:42,983 --> 00:21:48,152
(Hanil Bank Inspection Department)

644
00:21:48,153 --> 00:21:50,493
(And the oldest manager)

645
00:21:50,993 --> 00:21:53,362
(Even the bank's manager becomes small...)

646
00:21:53,363 --> 00:21:55,693
(when it comes to counting his salary.)

647
00:21:56,933 --> 00:21:58,292
A bank clerk's specialty is counting cash.

648
00:21:58,293 --> 00:21:59,933
He must need to count cash.

649
00:22:00,463 --> 00:22:02,873
- That's what I believe.
- It's what Dad's the best at.

650
00:22:03,273 --> 00:22:05,103
(The Icon of Optimism is back.)

651
00:22:05,403 --> 00:22:07,172
The games are what we're best at.

652
00:22:07,173 --> 00:22:09,972
- Exactly.
- The mission for our Sung Dong Il,

653
00:22:09,973 --> 00:22:12,373
who has devoted his life to making ends meet.

654
00:22:12,483 --> 00:22:15,013
Counting cash. Let's get on with it.

655
00:22:15,183 --> 00:22:17,012
- It's easy-peasy for Dad.
- Don't touch them.

656
00:22:17,013 --> 00:22:19,282
No. Trust me when I say I've never counted cash.

657
00:22:19,283 --> 00:22:21,129
- Everyone transfers money.
- It's okay. You can try now.

658
00:22:21,153 --> 00:22:23,023
Everything has become computerized.

659
00:22:23,053 --> 00:22:24,829
- It's not coins, is it?
- I'll open it for a few seconds.

660
00:22:24,853 --> 00:22:25,923
Don't touch them.

661
00:22:26,663 --> 00:22:27,823
Something like this, okay?

662
00:22:28,063 --> 00:22:29,392
- Good?
- It's a mix of cash.

663
00:22:29,393 --> 00:22:30,393
There were ten-dollar bills.

664
00:22:30,394 --> 00:22:32,093
- Even five-dollar bills.
- Really?

665
00:22:32,503 --> 00:22:34,002
Even an elementary school student...

666
00:22:34,003 --> 00:22:36,733
can easily count cash, right?

667
00:22:37,173 --> 00:22:39,472
Manager Sung Dong Il,

668
00:22:39,473 --> 00:22:41,803
who has dedicated his life at Hanil Bank,

669
00:22:42,243 --> 00:22:44,042
can count cash while singing.

670
00:22:44,043 --> 00:22:45,219
(He must count while singing!)

671
00:22:45,243 --> 00:22:46,782
- He must even sing.
- Dong Il must sing...

672
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:48,312
"Little Bunny" nonstop.

673
00:22:48,313 --> 00:22:49,582
The time limit is one minute.

674
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:50,853
- That's tough.
- Somehow...

675
00:22:51,013 --> 00:22:52,312
You must start once you grab the money.

676
00:22:52,313 --> 00:22:53,653
No putting it down, okay?

677
00:22:54,683 --> 00:22:57,753
(Dong Il's game: Count cash while singing)

678
00:22:57,923 --> 00:22:59,022
How can someone do that?

679
00:22:59,023 --> 00:23:00,792
But my dad drank.

680
00:23:00,793 --> 00:23:01,822
I get it now.

681
00:23:01,823 --> 00:23:03,893
He has to count cash while singing.

682
00:23:05,033 --> 00:23:06,432
- Which one? Fruits?
- Fruits.

683
00:23:06,433 --> 00:23:07,462
- Fruits.
- Fruits.

684
00:23:07,463 --> 00:23:08,933
- Fruits.
- Yes.

685
00:23:09,203 --> 00:23:10,372
We'll win everything.

686
00:23:10,373 --> 00:23:11,433
(Good luck, Dad!)

687
00:23:11,533 --> 00:23:13,373
(With the support from the eldest daughter)

688
00:23:13,903 --> 00:23:16,242
Here he goes.

689
00:23:16,243 --> 00:23:20,612
- Little bunny - Look at him focus.

690
00:23:20,613 --> 00:23:22,582
- You can't place them down.
- No? Okay.

691
00:23:22,583 --> 00:23:27,253
Where are you going?

692
00:23:27,983 --> 00:23:29,152
(Laughing)

693
00:23:29,153 --> 00:23:31,593
- While hopping - Why is it so funny?

694
00:23:32,423 --> 00:23:34,792
(It's not funny for me.)

695
00:23:34,793 --> 00:23:36,233
- Oh, dear.
- What did he do?

696
00:23:36,263 --> 00:23:38,462
- Twenty seconds in.
- Dong Il will make it.

697
00:23:38,463 --> 00:23:40,703
- He looks rich.
- Little bunny

698
00:23:41,633 --> 00:23:45,533
(Where's the cash going?)

699
00:23:45,773 --> 00:23:46,972
(The audience is enjoying it.)

700
00:23:46,973 --> 00:23:48,242
Thirty seconds in.

701
00:23:48,243 --> 00:23:49,443
(The audience is enjoying it.)

702
00:23:50,273 --> 00:23:51,513
It's like a children's show.

703
00:23:52,073 --> 00:23:54,683
(Using separating currency denomination skills)

704
00:23:55,743 --> 00:23:57,052
Hanil Bank's pride.

705
00:23:57,053 --> 00:23:58,153
(Featuring)

706
00:23:58,983 --> 00:24:00,353
Forty seconds in.

707
00:24:01,053 --> 00:24:02,223
He'll make it.

708
00:24:03,393 --> 00:24:06,823
(Almost done counting the money)

709
00:24:06,993 --> 00:24:08,963
(Is Dong Il done counting it?)

710
00:24:09,023 --> 00:24:10,392
- Fifty seconds in.
- Again.

711
00:24:10,393 --> 00:24:11,462
- Is he counting again?
- Oh, no.

712
00:24:11,463 --> 00:24:12,903
Counting again is bad.

713
00:24:13,733 --> 00:24:14,862
(Help me.)

714
00:24:14,863 --> 00:24:16,302
Six, seven.

715
00:24:16,303 --> 00:24:17,903
(This is bad.)

716
00:24:18,503 --> 00:24:19,802
Time's up. How much is it?

717
00:24:19,803 --> 00:24:20,803
(Taking the money away)

718
00:24:20,804 --> 00:24:21,842
How much is it?

719
00:24:21,843 --> 00:24:24,412
- Five, four, three, - Say a number.

720
00:24:24,413 --> 00:24:26,483
- two, one.
- Just say a number.

721
00:24:27,283 --> 00:24:29,882
- Fifty-seven dollars.
- Fifty-seven dollars.

722
00:24:29,883 --> 00:24:31,383
(What?)

723
00:24:32,153 --> 00:24:33,183
Good grief.

724
00:24:33,283 --> 00:24:35,003
- There's a fifty-dollar note.
- Incorrect.

725
00:24:35,483 --> 00:24:37,692
(The answer is 112 dollars.)

726
00:24:37,693 --> 00:24:38,892
It was fun.

727
00:24:38,893 --> 00:24:41,793
They mixed up the currency denomination in between.

728
00:24:42,393 --> 00:24:44,462
- It was a great plan.
- That was...

729
00:24:44,463 --> 00:24:45,893
It was a really good one.

730
00:24:46,803 --> 00:24:48,032
Either way, well done.

731
00:24:48,033 --> 00:24:49,302
The game was actually fun.

732
00:24:49,303 --> 00:24:50,503
- That was funny.
- Good job.

733
00:24:50,533 --> 00:24:52,333
The last player.

734
00:24:53,043 --> 00:24:54,143
- Jae Myung.
- Come.

735
00:24:54,473 --> 00:24:56,212
- Ryu Jae Myung!
- Ryu Jae Myung!

736
00:24:56,213 --> 00:24:57,642
- Ryu Jae Myung!
- Don't get your hopes up.

737
00:24:57,643 --> 00:24:59,272
- Just drink.
- Ryu Jae Myung!

738
00:24:59,273 --> 00:25:00,782
- Don't expect too much.
- Ryu Jae Myung!

739
00:25:00,783 --> 00:25:02,912
Please head over to the empty space.

740
00:25:02,913 --> 00:25:04,912
Stand before "Family Entertainment."

741
00:25:04,913 --> 00:25:06,082
(Director Na directs him to the open space.)

742
00:25:06,083 --> 00:25:09,083
(The production team brings in something big.)

743
00:25:09,153 --> 00:25:11,052
- What's that?
- It looks hard.

744
00:25:11,053 --> 00:25:12,522
- Is it something physical?
- What is it?

745
00:25:12,523 --> 00:25:13,769
(A blackboard with a circle on it?)

746
00:25:13,793 --> 00:25:16,263
- Wait. It's a circle, Jae Myung.
- It's a circle.

747
00:25:16,493 --> 00:25:18,133
- What?
- Drawing a circle.

748
00:25:19,263 --> 00:25:20,433
But...

749
00:25:20,833 --> 00:25:22,133
- Okay.
- That's new.

750
00:25:22,563 --> 00:25:25,072
The dad that even Dong Ryong was scared of.

751
00:25:25,073 --> 00:25:26,903
- Throw the chalk?
- Throwing the chalk.

752
00:25:27,103 --> 00:25:31,643
He was also a teacher who risked his life throwing chalk.

753
00:25:32,443 --> 00:25:34,883
- He'll surely hit the bull's eye.
- Jae Myung is good at it.

754
00:25:35,213 --> 00:25:37,282
(Dong Ryong's dad was...)

755
00:25:37,283 --> 00:25:39,603
(Ssangmun High School's supervisor and chemistry teacher.)

756
00:25:40,983 --> 00:25:42,923
You're all dead.

757
00:25:43,953 --> 00:25:45,193
Too bad for you.

758
00:25:46,593 --> 00:25:48,923
(Help Dong Ryong.)

759
00:25:49,633 --> 00:25:55,603
(The charismatic supervisor who subdued the class with just a chalk)

760
00:25:55,763 --> 00:25:57,733
The dad's mission is to throw the chalk.

761
00:25:57,933 --> 00:26:00,602
- He'll certainly hit it from here.
- Of course.

762
00:26:00,603 --> 00:26:02,473
Yes, it's not hard.

763
00:26:03,273 --> 00:26:05,513
You must spin five times first.

764
00:26:05,673 --> 00:26:07,583
- Five times.
- Spin five times.

765
00:26:07,613 --> 00:26:09,912
If the chalk hits within the circle, it's a success.

766
00:26:09,913 --> 00:26:11,013
- What?
- Only one?

767
00:26:11,253 --> 00:26:13,682
(Jae Myung's game: Spin and hit the target with a chalk)

768
00:26:13,683 --> 00:26:17,053
(The chalk must hit within the circle.)

769
00:26:17,293 --> 00:26:19,663
You must throw it in three seconds after you spin.

770
00:26:19,823 --> 00:26:21,323
- Only once?
- Once.

771
00:26:21,723 --> 00:26:22,863
- Once.
- How many throws?

772
00:26:22,893 --> 00:26:25,563
- One.
- That's impossible just as it is.

773
00:26:25,733 --> 00:26:27,303
But the circle is big.

774
00:26:27,633 --> 00:26:29,202
He's right. The chalk will surely land inside.

775
00:26:29,203 --> 00:26:30,402
- Isn't it the small one?
- The tiny one.

776
00:26:30,403 --> 00:26:32,603
No, that'd be absurd.

777
00:26:32,803 --> 00:26:34,042
Don't spin beforehand.

778
00:26:34,043 --> 00:26:35,073
(Worried)

779
00:26:35,143 --> 00:26:36,542
- In the past...
- Jae Myung.

780
00:26:36,543 --> 00:26:37,872
- Yes?
- Please stand over here.

781
00:26:37,873 --> 00:26:39,543
- This is where you'll play.
- Okay.

782
00:26:39,783 --> 00:26:41,683
- Here's your chalk.
- Okay.

783
00:26:41,883 --> 00:26:43,883
When you're ready, shout "Here I go!"

784
00:26:43,983 --> 00:26:45,082
- Don't expect too much.
- Good luck.

785
00:26:45,083 --> 00:26:46,152
- Just drink.
- Okay.

786
00:26:46,153 --> 00:26:47,482
- Good luck, Dad!
- Good luck!

787
00:26:47,483 --> 00:26:49,022
- Good luck!
- Good luck!

788
00:26:49,023 --> 00:26:51,092
- Good luck, Supervisor!
- Good luck, Jae Myung!

789
00:26:51,093 --> 00:26:52,392
Throw it within three seconds...

790
00:26:52,393 --> 00:26:53,663
- Okay.
- after you spin.

791
00:26:53,763 --> 00:26:55,093
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

792
00:26:55,493 --> 00:26:56,532
All right.

793
00:26:56,533 --> 00:26:57,633
Go.

794
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,093
Go.

795
00:26:59,363 --> 00:27:00,962
- One.
- One.

796
00:27:00,963 --> 00:27:02,002
- Two.
- Two.

797
00:27:02,003 --> 00:27:03,733
- Not yet. Two.
- Three.

798
00:27:03,933 --> 00:27:05,572
- Three.
- Three.

799
00:27:05,573 --> 00:27:06,773
- Is it three now?
- Wait.

800
00:27:06,973 --> 00:27:08,142
- Three.
- Three.

801
00:27:08,143 --> 00:27:09,242
- Wait.
- What's wrong?

802
00:27:09,243 --> 00:27:10,573
- Four.
- Gosh.

803
00:27:10,873 --> 00:27:12,813
(He's finally on his last spin!)

804
00:27:12,913 --> 00:27:14,242
Five. Okay.

805
00:27:14,243 --> 00:27:16,813
In 3, 2, 1.

806
00:27:17,013 --> 00:27:19,283
(Will the supervisor succeed?)

807
00:27:19,532 --> 00:27:21,227
(He's finally on his last spin!)

808
00:27:21,493 --> 00:27:22,792
Five. Okay.

809
00:27:22,793 --> 00:27:25,263
In 3, 2, 1.

810
00:27:25,633 --> 00:27:28,133
(Will the supervisor succeed?)

811
00:27:28,203 --> 00:27:29,433
Two, one.

812
00:27:30,473 --> 00:27:31,632
(After throwing it with all his might, )

813
00:27:31,633 --> 00:27:34,973
(he dove into his son's arms.)

814
00:27:35,373 --> 00:27:37,813
(The first and last shot he put everything into)

815
00:27:38,173 --> 00:27:40,143
(Gosh, how cool he is.)

816
00:27:40,513 --> 00:27:42,012
It totally went in.

817
00:27:42,013 --> 00:27:44,213
(Throwing a ceremony)

818
00:27:44,283 --> 00:27:45,352
Well done.

819
00:27:45,353 --> 00:27:46,682
- Father!
- Good job.

820
00:27:46,683 --> 00:27:48,322
- Father!
- Father!

821
00:27:48,323 --> 00:27:49,482
(A gold medal-like finale)

822
00:27:49,483 --> 00:27:50,722
Success.

823
00:27:50,723 --> 00:27:52,923
(The supervisor has succeeded at the game.)

824
00:27:53,023 --> 00:27:55,162
Jae Myung, that was cool.

825
00:27:55,163 --> 00:27:57,593
- You kept your eyes on the target.
- Yes.

826
00:27:58,193 --> 00:27:59,762
He fell down after throwing it.

827
00:27:59,763 --> 00:28:00,863
(The dad's game has ended.)

828
00:28:01,033 --> 00:28:02,432
- It's fun.
- But she's...

829
00:28:02,433 --> 00:28:04,473
bad at games!

830
00:28:04,873 --> 00:28:06,502
(Trying the prize)

831
00:28:06,503 --> 00:28:07,603
Nice scent, right?

832
00:28:08,643 --> 00:28:10,443
- It'll last for three days.
- Bring it over.

833
00:28:10,513 --> 00:28:12,013
It's like a perfume.

834
00:28:12,413 --> 00:28:14,983
(Kyung Pyo cautiously tries a glass.)

835
00:28:15,143 --> 00:28:16,213
(Exhaling)

836
00:28:16,483 --> 00:28:17,553
It's different, right?

837
00:28:17,753 --> 00:28:19,253
(Impressed)

838
00:28:20,153 --> 00:28:21,983
I love how it has that cheesy taste.

839
00:28:22,023 --> 00:28:23,822
So this is what vintage wine tastes like.

840
00:28:23,823 --> 00:28:25,152
I've heard people talk about vintage wine,

841
00:28:25,153 --> 00:28:26,693
but it's really expensive.

842
00:28:26,963 --> 00:28:28,393
I want to try some.

843
00:28:28,893 --> 00:28:30,933
(Hye Ri also tries the vintage wine.)

844
00:28:31,863 --> 00:28:33,833
It's too bitter for me.

845
00:28:33,963 --> 00:28:35,832
- Where's the director?
- Where's the director?

846
00:28:35,833 --> 00:28:37,602
- Shin Won Ho!
- Shin Won Ho!

847
00:28:37,603 --> 00:28:39,273
- Shin Won Ho!
- Shin Won Ho!

848
00:28:39,373 --> 00:28:41,372
- Hurry up.
- Come here right now.

849
00:28:41,373 --> 00:28:43,173
- Come in - Shin Won Ho!

850
00:28:43,413 --> 00:28:45,543
(Coming in reluctantly)

851
00:28:45,643 --> 00:28:47,513
(The director has been summoned.)

852
00:28:47,713 --> 00:28:49,042
(Staring)

853
00:28:49,043 --> 00:28:50,112
Won Ho.

854
00:28:50,113 --> 00:28:51,783
Why did you pick Sung Kyun?

855
00:28:52,353 --> 00:28:53,753
- What?
- I've been really curious.

856
00:28:54,523 --> 00:28:55,752
When I first saw him on the set,

857
00:28:55,753 --> 00:28:56,993
I couldn't drop the formality.

858
00:28:57,223 --> 00:28:59,023
(Sung Kyun is 16 years younger than Dong Il.)

859
00:28:59,223 --> 00:29:00,692
His looks got him the role.

860
00:29:00,693 --> 00:29:02,122
The only actor chosen for his looks.

861
00:29:02,123 --> 00:29:03,262
(Cast by his looks)

862
00:29:03,263 --> 00:29:04,393
He looks like a young boy...

863
00:29:04,593 --> 00:29:05,863
as well as an old man.

864
00:29:06,163 --> 00:29:07,463
I was genuinely shocked.

865
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:09,803
I was told someone was a year older than me.

866
00:29:11,973 --> 00:29:14,742
Originally, his role was supposed to be a year older than mine.

867
00:29:14,743 --> 00:29:16,942
- Originally?
- Yes.

868
00:29:16,943 --> 00:29:19,883
But in the drama, I speak casually while he speaks formally.

869
00:29:20,483 --> 00:29:24,082
He told me to drop the formality,

870
00:29:24,083 --> 00:29:25,183
but I just couldn't.

871
00:29:25,683 --> 00:29:27,653
(Found it hard to drop the formality)

872
00:29:27,923 --> 00:29:30,993
From what I see, it's been ten years.

873
00:29:31,353 --> 00:29:32,892
- Yes.
- But everyone has become...

874
00:29:32,893 --> 00:29:34,722
younger than they were ten years ago.

875
00:29:34,723 --> 00:29:35,793
True.

876
00:29:36,363 --> 00:29:38,433
In short, I'm happy for all of us.

877
00:29:39,093 --> 00:29:41,333
It makes me happy to see you...

878
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:43,533
in different dramas.

879
00:29:44,133 --> 00:29:46,132
There are many great works.

880
00:29:46,133 --> 00:29:48,242
But this was the first one to make me...

881
00:29:48,243 --> 00:29:51,472
so emotional and to bring us together again.

882
00:29:51,473 --> 00:29:53,543
Despite seeing each other every day,

883
00:29:53,613 --> 00:29:55,843
we cry for the same reason again and again.

884
00:29:56,413 --> 00:29:58,413
Our eyes get puffy from all the crying.

885
00:29:59,453 --> 00:30:02,992
When Bo Gum appears in commercials and stuff,

886
00:30:02,993 --> 00:30:06,363
I recall one sentence almost immediately.

887
00:30:06,923 --> 00:30:10,032
"When do you miss your mom the most?"

888
00:30:10,033 --> 00:30:11,693
- That scene?
- Right.

889
00:30:11,933 --> 00:30:14,002
We were on the wooden bench.

890
00:30:14,003 --> 00:30:15,862
- It left the deepest impression.
- Yes.

891
00:30:15,863 --> 00:30:18,803
He's crying. Why did you have to make him cry?

892
00:30:18,973 --> 00:30:21,273
(Let's watch the scene that made Bo Gum cry.)

893
00:30:22,803 --> 00:30:25,272
(Dong Il and Taek talk...)

894
00:30:25,273 --> 00:30:27,883
(after the funeral of Dong Il's mom.)

895
00:30:28,513 --> 00:30:30,683
Everyone misses their mom the most.

896
00:30:32,513 --> 00:30:34,383
Gosh, how I miss my mom.

897
00:30:36,953 --> 00:30:38,053
Taek.

898
00:30:39,353 --> 00:30:42,123
When do you miss your mom the most?

899
00:30:45,533 --> 00:30:46,533
Every day.

900
00:30:47,803 --> 00:30:50,932
I miss Mom every day.

901
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:52,933
(Dong Il's question that made the mature Taek cry)

902
00:30:53,073 --> 00:30:55,573
It was one of the best scenes.

903
00:30:55,803 --> 00:30:58,972
Right before the guy whose mom had just passed away.

904
00:30:58,973 --> 00:31:01,143
It wasn't a cry-a-bucket scene.

905
00:31:01,913 --> 00:31:04,713
But Bo Gum wasn't able to shed a single tear.

906
00:31:05,913 --> 00:31:06,922
He did...

907
00:31:06,923 --> 00:31:08,022
when the camera turned...

908
00:31:08,023 --> 00:31:09,123
- toward Dong Il.
- Yes.

909
00:31:09,223 --> 00:31:10,223
(Bo Gum had to act out an emotionally difficult scene.)

910
00:31:10,224 --> 00:31:12,492
But when the camera turned to him again, Bo Gum stopped.

911
00:31:12,493 --> 00:31:13,793
You know how he couldn't cry?

912
00:31:14,123 --> 00:31:16,633
"Don't move. No one is to move."

913
00:31:17,093 --> 00:31:20,133
That made it worse for him. "Don't move."

914
00:31:20,733 --> 00:31:22,432
- "Don't move." - Really?

915
00:31:22,433 --> 00:31:24,032
- I remember.
- "Again."

916
00:31:24,033 --> 00:31:25,502
- "Don't move. Again." - To make him cry?

917
00:31:25,503 --> 00:31:27,402
"I'll help you from the top again."

918
00:31:27,403 --> 00:31:29,812
That made Bo Gum cry just when Director Won Ho wanted.

919
00:31:29,813 --> 00:31:31,142
He didn't burst into tears,

920
00:31:31,143 --> 00:31:32,873
- but it was enough.
- Yes.

921
00:31:33,043 --> 00:31:35,183
I remember the line I said to Dad.

922
00:31:35,443 --> 00:31:38,912
When Dad asked if he could date Sun Young again,

923
00:31:38,913 --> 00:31:41,783
- Right, that line.
- I told him,

924
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:44,953
"I want you to eat warm meals every day."

925
00:31:45,893 --> 00:31:48,393
With Sun Woo's mom, as good friends,

926
00:31:49,893 --> 00:31:51,592
I want to talk...

927
00:31:51,593 --> 00:31:52,992
(Moo Sung asked if he could marry Sun Woo's mom.)

928
00:31:52,993 --> 00:31:56,603
and spend the rest of my life with her.

929
00:31:58,033 --> 00:31:59,233
But listen, Taek.

930
00:32:01,703 --> 00:32:04,243
If you're against it,

931
00:32:05,573 --> 00:32:08,083
I won't befriend her.

932
00:32:09,343 --> 00:32:10,913
I want you to have...

933
00:32:12,683 --> 00:32:15,553
warm meals even when I'm not here, Dad.

934
00:32:16,283 --> 00:32:18,853
(Taek's answer was him accepting Moo Sung's remarriage.)

935
00:32:19,123 --> 00:32:23,333
That scene didn't require him to cry,

936
00:32:23,963 --> 00:32:25,362
but the emotions...

937
00:32:25,363 --> 00:32:26,762
- were just perfect.
- I know, right?

938
00:32:26,763 --> 00:32:29,103
- I thought it was nice.
- She's all skin and bones.

939
00:32:29,233 --> 00:32:32,072
The emotions that children and adults feel are the same.

940
00:32:32,073 --> 00:32:33,943
Family is the core.

941
00:32:34,173 --> 00:32:35,373
That never changes.

942
00:32:36,003 --> 00:32:38,442
I heard from many people that this drama stayed with them...

943
00:32:38,443 --> 00:32:40,443
- Same.
- because of that.

944
00:32:41,183 --> 00:32:42,213
Should I boil them all?

945
00:32:42,583 --> 00:32:44,263
(Mi Ran boils the ramyeon won as a prize.)

946
00:32:44,513 --> 00:32:45,852
(Sung Kyun gets the water ready.)

947
00:32:45,853 --> 00:32:47,623
- Mi Ran, until the fourth mark.
- Leave it.

948
00:32:49,453 --> 00:32:51,523
(Setting up the tongs in advance)

949
00:32:51,853 --> 00:32:52,893
The tongs.

950
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:56,533
(Cooking everything)

951
00:32:57,163 --> 00:32:59,193
(Making the noodles firm)

952
00:32:59,363 --> 00:33:01,633
- Who wants ramyeon?
- Made by Mi Ran.

953
00:33:02,363 --> 00:33:03,472
Here.

954
00:33:03,473 --> 00:33:04,702
He hasn't eaten anything.

955
00:33:04,703 --> 00:33:06,463
- You should cook more ramyeon.
- No, but...

956
00:33:06,973 --> 00:33:08,042
Isn't it funny?

957
00:33:08,043 --> 00:33:09,642
We, Koreans, have to wrap up...

958
00:33:09,643 --> 00:33:11,513
- The final meal.
- any meal with ramyeon.

959
00:33:12,213 --> 00:33:13,243
(Blowing on it)

960
00:33:13,343 --> 00:33:14,883
(Slurping noodles right away)

961
00:33:15,583 --> 00:33:16,612
Good, right?

962
00:33:16,613 --> 00:33:18,382
- Mi Ran cooked it perfectly.
- Right?

963
00:33:18,383 --> 00:33:19,383
Gosh.

964
00:33:19,683 --> 00:33:21,422
- It's delicious.
- For real?

965
00:33:21,423 --> 00:33:22,982
- You call this a technique.
- Gosh.

966
00:33:22,983 --> 00:33:24,393
(Shout-out to Mi Ran)

967
00:33:24,893 --> 00:33:25,922
(Holding up the glass out of shyness)

968
00:33:25,923 --> 00:33:27,063
Our juniors.

969
00:33:27,993 --> 00:33:29,932
We always met up separately.

970
00:33:29,933 --> 00:33:31,032
Cheers.

971
00:33:31,033 --> 00:33:32,763
Is it fun when you hang out together?

972
00:33:33,263 --> 00:33:34,603
We don't meet up.

973
00:33:35,203 --> 00:33:37,833
You should've organized one, Deok Sun.

974
00:33:38,203 --> 00:33:39,403
I do at times.

975
00:33:41,203 --> 00:33:43,542
So we're all here together because of Bo Gum today?

976
00:33:43,543 --> 00:33:45,312
- No.
- As expected.

977
00:33:45,313 --> 00:33:46,883
Give him a round of applause.

978
00:33:47,013 --> 00:33:48,782
- No.
- Park Bo Gum!

979
00:33:48,783 --> 00:33:50,382
- Park Bo Gum!
- It's not me.

980
00:33:50,383 --> 00:33:53,783
- Handsome, kind, cute, and cool - And cool

981
00:33:54,153 --> 00:33:55,382
(Enjoying it as he can't escape)

982
00:33:55,383 --> 00:33:57,423
- Park Bo Gum!
- Nice.

983
00:33:57,693 --> 00:33:58,992
Good job, everyone.

984
00:33:58,993 --> 00:34:00,222
Cheers.

985
00:34:00,223 --> 00:34:01,762
No doubt, okay?

986
00:34:01,763 --> 00:34:03,533
(Bo Gum quietly makes a ssam.)

987
00:34:04,463 --> 00:34:06,333
Gosh, Bo Gum is really the best.

988
00:34:07,133 --> 00:34:09,933
I finally get the reason Bo Gum works without a break.

989
00:34:10,633 --> 00:34:12,533
(Expressing his love)

990
00:34:12,973 --> 00:34:15,003
- Jae Hong, show them.
- Really?

991
00:34:15,603 --> 00:34:16,943
The hermit crab.

992
00:34:17,213 --> 00:34:18,972
No, the corone.

993
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:20,783
I've never done the hermit crab before.

994
00:34:20,943 --> 00:34:23,043
- Isn't this the hermit crab?
- Kwon Sang Woo.

995
00:34:23,953 --> 00:34:25,782
- It's impossible.
- It needs to come over.

996
00:34:25,783 --> 00:34:27,882
- His fingers became thin.
- Everyone is trying it.

997
00:34:27,883 --> 00:34:29,383
Show us, Jae Hong!

998
00:34:30,023 --> 00:34:32,353
(This is the corone.)

999
00:34:33,123 --> 00:34:35,193
- It became too small.
- The bones...

1000
00:34:35,863 --> 00:34:38,593
That's what he showed off as his talent at our first meeting.

1001
00:34:38,863 --> 00:34:39,933
Really?

1002
00:34:40,133 --> 00:34:41,933
He said, "I'm very flexible."

1003
00:34:42,263 --> 00:34:43,672
"Just how flexible?"

1004
00:34:43,673 --> 00:34:47,173
I thought he'd do acrobatics or something.

1005
00:34:47,943 --> 00:34:49,243
Man Ok, by any chance...

1006
00:34:51,113 --> 00:34:52,543
Do you like corone?

1007
00:34:54,143 --> 00:34:55,183
(Laughing)

1008
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:57,453
(The corone that made Man Ok burst into laughter)

1009
00:34:57,653 --> 00:34:59,913
I just baked us a corone.

1010
00:35:00,853 --> 00:35:03,923
(The cute scene that highlighted Jae Hong's flexibility)

1011
00:35:04,353 --> 00:35:05,552
- Did you laugh?
- When...

1012
00:35:05,553 --> 00:35:07,292
did you find out you could do that?

1013
00:35:07,293 --> 00:35:08,293
I know, right?

1014
00:35:08,393 --> 00:35:11,393
I wanted to do anything I could in that spot.

1015
00:35:11,563 --> 00:35:13,403
- Even if I got hurt.
- Jae Hong.

1016
00:35:14,633 --> 00:35:17,032
His desperation made it possible.

1017
00:35:17,033 --> 00:35:19,573
- I could've done more.
- You must do anything.

1018
00:35:19,973 --> 00:35:21,442
Just a bit more, Jae Hong.

1019
00:35:21,443 --> 00:35:23,873
(Confirmed his flexibility)

1020
00:35:24,273 --> 00:35:25,313
I'm flexible too.

1021
00:35:25,543 --> 00:35:26,682
- Good.
- You're right.

1022
00:35:26,683 --> 00:35:28,043
(See this, Ahn Jae Hong?)

1023
00:35:28,313 --> 00:35:30,312
Is your back straight or not?

1024
00:35:30,313 --> 00:35:31,633
- Straighten it.
- She can do it.

1025
00:35:32,053 --> 00:35:33,823
(An encore)

1026
00:35:34,483 --> 00:35:35,583
Straighten it.

1027
00:35:36,353 --> 00:35:37,753
Straighten it.

1028
00:35:37,853 --> 00:35:38,953
It's a competition.

1029
00:35:39,823 --> 00:35:41,362
- Straighten it.
- Straighten it.

1030
00:35:41,363 --> 00:35:43,063
(A flexibility competition for no reason)

1031
00:35:43,333 --> 00:35:45,662
- How did you do that?
- Hye Ri's toes can do...

1032
00:35:45,663 --> 00:35:47,163
the coin.

1033
00:35:47,403 --> 00:35:49,832
- Point?
- Yes.

1034
00:35:49,833 --> 00:35:51,172
Coin is cash, Dong Il.

1035
00:35:51,173 --> 00:35:53,343
No, she can do the coin.

1036
00:35:53,603 --> 00:35:55,343
Straighten your back, Bo Gum.

1037
00:35:56,103 --> 00:35:59,413
(I can even do this.)

1038
00:35:59,673 --> 00:36:01,412
What Jae Hong can do with his fingers,

1039
00:36:01,413 --> 00:36:03,683
- Hye Ri can do with her body.
- Gosh.

1040
00:36:04,213 --> 00:36:05,583
You'll hurt yourself.

1041
00:36:05,683 --> 00:36:06,683
I must do it.

1042
00:36:08,153 --> 00:36:09,883
- I must do it.
- I must do it.

1043
00:36:11,323 --> 00:36:13,593
(Hye Ri rolls while doing the split)

1044
00:36:13,663 --> 00:36:15,463
- I must do it.
- I must do it.

1045
00:36:16,063 --> 00:36:18,532
- Of course.
- With our phones...

1046
00:36:18,533 --> 00:36:19,862
But...

1047
00:36:19,863 --> 00:36:21,363
(One leg... No, she put up two legs.)

1048
00:36:21,633 --> 00:36:23,133
She can do both.

1049
00:36:23,833 --> 00:36:25,372
(Acknowledged)

1050
00:36:25,373 --> 00:36:26,773
She's the real deal.

1051
00:36:27,573 --> 00:36:29,743
The daughters of that family are weird.

1052
00:36:29,843 --> 00:36:31,512
Sung family,

1053
00:36:31,513 --> 00:36:32,773
- let's go!
- Let's go!

1054
00:36:33,483 --> 00:36:34,512
(After the flexibility competition)

1055
00:36:34,513 --> 00:36:35,783
Both are...

1056
00:36:35,843 --> 00:36:37,782
If I could,

1057
00:36:37,783 --> 00:36:39,483
I'd love to stay until the end.

1058
00:36:40,083 --> 00:36:41,723
Be careful on your way back.

1059
00:36:42,053 --> 00:36:43,182
Let go of me.

1060
00:36:43,183 --> 00:36:46,693
(Lee Il Hwa and Choi Sung Won leave for their next schedule.)

1061
00:36:47,093 --> 00:36:48,862
- Goodnight.
- See?

1062
00:36:48,863 --> 00:36:49,963
Bye.

1063
00:36:50,433 --> 00:36:52,033
(Everyone is going to bed now!)

1064
00:36:52,163 --> 00:36:54,003
Let's get started.

1065
00:36:54,803 --> 00:36:57,233
(YB goes for round 2 on the 4th floor.)

1066
00:36:57,833 --> 00:36:59,503
- In 1, 2, 3.
- I love you.

1067
00:36:59,833 --> 00:37:01,603
(Taking a group photo first)

1068
00:37:02,403 --> 00:37:03,413
Thank you.

1069
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:05,342
We didn't take many photos.

1070
00:37:05,343 --> 00:37:06,413
I know, right?

1071
00:37:07,083 --> 00:37:08,112
All that stays behind are...

1072
00:37:08,113 --> 00:37:10,282
When I went on a trip with Bo Gum,

1073
00:37:10,283 --> 00:37:12,082
I said, "Can't we stop taking photos?"

1074
00:37:12,083 --> 00:37:13,453
"Let's remember it with our eyes."

1075
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:15,452
Even back then, you were Bad Boy Ko Kyung Pyo.

1076
00:37:15,453 --> 00:37:18,593
Yes. I thought I could change him into me.

1077
00:37:18,953 --> 00:37:21,092
But he changed me into him.

1078
00:37:21,093 --> 00:37:22,993
- Really?
- When we returned,

1079
00:37:23,093 --> 00:37:24,862
- Did you regret it?
- all that was left were photos.

1080
00:37:24,863 --> 00:37:26,733
- Yes.
- Of course.

1081
00:37:27,363 --> 00:37:28,933
I really respect him.

1082
00:37:29,133 --> 00:37:31,433
Did you have to take such a detour to figure that out?

1083
00:37:33,133 --> 00:37:35,043
Was it something hard to realize?

1084
00:37:35,273 --> 00:37:36,542
I sent them to you, right?

1085
00:37:36,543 --> 00:37:37,543
You sent all of them to me.

1086
00:37:37,544 --> 00:37:39,572
- But that phone...
- Did you lose it?

1087
00:37:39,573 --> 00:37:40,612
- Gosh.
- No.

1088
00:37:40,613 --> 00:37:41,882
I lost the photos while backing up my phone.

1089
00:37:41,883 --> 00:37:43,212
- To the...
- While backing up.

1090
00:37:43,213 --> 00:37:44,852
- I still have them.
- What a bummer.

1091
00:37:44,853 --> 00:37:45,853
I back up my phone.

1092
00:37:45,854 --> 00:37:47,282
Send them to him again.

1093
00:37:47,283 --> 00:37:48,582
Okay, I have them at home.

1094
00:37:48,583 --> 00:37:49,723
Good.

1095
00:37:49,883 --> 00:37:51,193
Can I browbeat you if you don't?

1096
00:37:51,523 --> 00:37:53,323
- Beat him?
- Browbeat him.

1097
00:37:53,563 --> 00:37:54,622
If you don't send them to him...

1098
00:37:54,623 --> 00:37:56,293
(A browbeat fight)

1099
00:37:56,463 --> 00:37:58,562
- A browbeat fight.
- Browbeat.

1100
00:37:58,563 --> 00:38:00,403
- He's a funny guy.
- Right?

1101
00:38:00,463 --> 00:38:02,602
- But really.
- Why is he always so hilarious?

1102
00:38:02,603 --> 00:38:04,573
- Doesn't he have perfect timing?
- Yes.

1103
00:38:04,873 --> 00:38:06,673
(Born to make others laugh)

1104
00:38:06,733 --> 00:38:07,972
But did you know?

1105
00:38:07,973 --> 00:38:09,703
Jae Hong gets shy around strangers.

1106
00:38:09,773 --> 00:38:11,813
No matter how many tests I take,

1107
00:38:12,013 --> 00:38:14,943
all change except for the introvert part.

1108
00:38:15,013 --> 00:38:17,182
- Me too.
- Jae Hong is relaxed around us,

1109
00:38:17,183 --> 00:38:18,783
but he's actually the shy type.

1110
00:38:19,383 --> 00:38:22,083
Would you be able to shoot "Youth Over Flowers" at this age?

1111
00:38:22,423 --> 00:38:25,452
- Was it to Africa?
- I want to give it a shot.

1112
00:38:25,453 --> 00:38:27,063
- Me too.
- I see.

1113
00:38:27,293 --> 00:38:29,093
If I had a chance to go again,

1114
00:38:29,263 --> 00:38:31,363
I'm not sure about Africa,

1115
00:38:31,593 --> 00:38:33,533
- but I'd love to go there.
- Where?

1116
00:38:33,703 --> 00:38:34,902
The reward vacation place.

1117
00:38:34,903 --> 00:38:36,133
- Phuket?
- Phuket.

1118
00:38:36,363 --> 00:38:39,002
I want us to go to Phuket...

1119
00:38:39,003 --> 00:38:40,503
and have more fun.

1120
00:38:40,773 --> 00:38:41,803
Gosh.

1121
00:38:42,243 --> 00:38:44,242
I wonder when we can meet up again.

1122
00:38:44,243 --> 00:38:45,473
After several years, right?

1123
00:38:46,713 --> 00:38:48,843
Can't we meet up more often when we can?

1124
00:38:49,083 --> 00:38:50,182
Can't we take a selfie?

1125
00:38:50,183 --> 00:38:52,152
Just one for ourselves, not others.

1126
00:38:52,153 --> 00:38:53,553
Let's meet on the 20th anniversary.

1127
00:38:53,923 --> 00:38:56,853
(A photo out of happiness as well as sadness)

1128
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:58,622
I was happy on our way here.

1129
00:38:58,623 --> 00:39:00,052
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

1130
00:39:00,053 --> 00:39:01,293
Goodnight, Kyung Pyo.

1131
00:39:04,033 --> 00:39:06,062
(The lights on the 4th floor...)

1132
00:39:06,063 --> 00:39:09,102
(that has been on the longest are finally off.)

1133
00:39:09,103 --> 00:39:10,302
(Min Ji)

1134
00:39:10,303 --> 00:39:12,002
(Everyone is sound asleep at the YB's lodging.)

1135
00:39:12,003 --> 00:39:14,643
(Hye Ri)

1136
00:39:14,973 --> 00:39:17,973
(And an empty spot is found.)

1137
00:39:18,543 --> 00:39:20,982
(Current time: 6:05am)

1138
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:24,083
(Hye Young is ready to head out for some reason.)

1139
00:39:24,453 --> 00:39:25,552
Hi.

1140
00:39:25,553 --> 00:39:27,623
- Did you have a good sleep?
- Yes.

1141
00:39:27,983 --> 00:39:32,193
(Why are they up at dawn when they slept at dawn?)

1142
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:35,799
(Last night, the two called Director Na.)

1143
00:39:36,259 --> 00:39:38,798
- We're going to see the sunrise.
- The sunrise.

1144
00:39:38,799 --> 00:39:39,799
Are you going to film it?

1145
00:39:40,269 --> 00:39:42,615
- Should we film it ourselves?
- We'll do it if it's okay with you.

1146
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:44,509
Let's ask when the sun will come up.

1147
00:39:45,269 --> 00:39:46,569
It'll be 6:33am.

1148
00:39:46,909 --> 00:39:49,539
- Is it 6:33am?
- Yes. It's 6:33am.

1149
00:39:49,639 --> 00:39:50,949
Should we meet at 6:10am, then?

1150
00:39:51,209 --> 00:39:52,548
At 6:10am? Okay.

1151
00:39:52,549 --> 00:39:53,618
- At 6:10am.
- Okay.

1152
00:39:53,619 --> 00:39:54,818
- Will it be okay?
- Yes.

1153
00:39:54,819 --> 00:39:56,778
But her running speed is... Tell him.

1154
00:39:56,779 --> 00:39:57,888
Are you going to run at my pace?

1155
00:39:57,889 --> 00:39:59,048
- Or vice versa?
- I'll match your pace.

1156
00:39:59,049 --> 00:40:00,288
- Really?
- He should.

1157
00:40:00,289 --> 00:40:01,718
- The better runner should.
- Right.

1158
00:40:01,719 --> 00:40:03,318
- I run at a ten-minute pace.
- Hye Young is...

1159
00:40:03,319 --> 00:40:04,429
She runs like this.

1160
00:40:04,589 --> 00:40:06,269
- I run at a ten-minute pace.
- Like this.

1161
00:40:07,099 --> 00:40:08,698
- I run at a 13-minute pace.
- Isn't it...

1162
00:40:08,699 --> 00:40:10,568
- At 13 minutes per kilometer?
- Isn't walking 12 minutes?

1163
00:40:10,569 --> 00:40:11,569
You're right. So...

1164
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:13,328
- The walkers walk past me.
- I see.

1165
00:40:13,329 --> 00:40:14,598
Is there such a thing as a 13-minute pace?

1166
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:15,699
That's amazing.

1167
00:40:15,899 --> 00:40:17,209
- It's actually harder.
- I see.

1168
00:40:17,509 --> 00:40:19,138
Because I have to run slower than my walking pace.

1169
00:40:19,139 --> 00:40:20,778
I heard that was popular lately.

1170
00:40:20,779 --> 00:40:22,438
(They'll do the slow running, which is popular lately.)

1171
00:40:22,439 --> 00:40:23,479
She really runs like that.

1172
00:40:24,349 --> 00:40:27,419
(The running mates head outside after getting ready.)

1173
00:40:28,819 --> 00:40:30,289
It's raining, isn't it?

1174
00:40:31,049 --> 00:40:32,818
- What?
- It's raining, right?

1175
00:40:32,819 --> 00:40:33,959
Yes. It's raining.

1176
00:40:35,189 --> 00:40:38,528
(They start running through the early morning rain.)

1177
00:40:38,529 --> 00:40:39,629
Which way should we go?

1178
00:40:39,689 --> 00:40:40,828
Should we go this way?

1179
00:40:40,829 --> 00:40:42,058
Okay. This way?

1180
00:40:42,059 --> 00:40:43,159
- Yes.
- Okay.

1181
00:40:44,099 --> 00:40:46,829
- You can run ahead of me.
- Okay.

1182
00:40:47,739 --> 00:40:49,068
- Then I'll follow you.
- Yes.

1183
00:40:49,069 --> 00:40:50,429
(They'll run at Hye Young's pace.)

1184
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:51,839
- Yesterday, - Yes.

1185
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:55,079
- what did you say we can prevent...
- Yes.

1186
00:40:55,309 --> 00:40:58,309
And benefit from by running at a 13-minute pace?

1187
00:40:58,509 --> 00:41:01,179
Right. When we run at a 13-minute pace,

1188
00:41:01,919 --> 00:41:04,218
we can run while maintaining...

1189
00:41:04,219 --> 00:41:06,119
the low heart rate.

1190
00:41:06,149 --> 00:41:07,718
(Slow running's benefits: It helps strengthen your heart.)

1191
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:09,458
(It increases your stamina.)

1192
00:41:09,459 --> 00:41:11,658
(Once you get used to it, your body changes...)

1193
00:41:11,659 --> 00:41:13,799
(so that it burns your fat first.)

1194
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:16,558
But I'm still getting used to it.

1195
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:18,029
(A slow-running beginner)

1196
00:41:18,429 --> 00:41:19,628
It's raining.

1197
00:41:19,629 --> 00:41:21,175
(She has gotten used to the weather, though.)

1198
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:22,639
We're getting rained on.

1199
00:41:22,969 --> 00:41:24,238
- A run in the rain.
- It's crazy, isn't it?

1200
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:25,269
(A run in the rain)

1201
00:41:25,709 --> 00:41:26,908
Yo!

1202
00:41:26,909 --> 00:41:29,469
(Though they slept for 3 hours, they're unbelievably energetic.)

1203
00:41:29,739 --> 00:41:31,078
We're running too fast.

1204
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:32,485
(Current pace: 7 minutes 30 seconds)

1205
00:41:32,509 --> 00:41:34,649
- You can run at your normal pace.
- Okay.

1206
00:41:35,379 --> 00:41:38,049
Then I'll slow down to run at an eight-minute pace.

1207
00:41:38,689 --> 00:41:39,849
You can walk now.

1208
00:41:40,189 --> 00:41:41,758
(Laughing)

1209
00:41:41,759 --> 00:41:43,659
That's right. It's not going to be that tough.

1210
00:41:45,389 --> 00:41:47,670
I don't think we can see the sunrise. Don't you think so?

1211
00:41:48,059 --> 00:41:50,229
- Will we be able to see it?
- It's cloudy.

1212
00:41:54,269 --> 00:41:55,668
(Cloudy)

1213
00:41:55,669 --> 00:41:57,839
(It seems it'll be hard to see the sunrise.)

1214
00:41:58,409 --> 00:42:00,139
Gosh. How can it be...

1215
00:42:02,409 --> 00:42:03,578
this cloudy?

1216
00:42:03,579 --> 00:42:04,949
(Sad)

1217
00:42:05,049 --> 00:42:06,308
I like the rain,

1218
00:42:06,309 --> 00:42:07,749
but we won't be able to see the sun.

1219
00:42:09,749 --> 00:42:11,189
It's 6:31am, right now.

1220
00:42:11,789 --> 00:42:12,948
- Really?
- Yes.

1221
00:42:12,949 --> 00:42:14,389
It's one minute before the sunrise.

1222
00:42:15,959 --> 00:42:17,789
- When it gets bright, - Right.

1223
00:42:18,259 --> 00:42:19,729
- that's it.
- It is what it is.

1224
00:42:19,929 --> 00:42:21,498
- The sun is up.
- The sun is up.

1225
00:42:21,499 --> 00:42:23,699
(When it gets bright, they'll assume it's the sunrise.)

1226
00:42:24,169 --> 00:42:26,198
(Looking around)

1227
00:42:26,199 --> 00:42:27,199
(Looking around again)

1228
00:42:27,799 --> 00:42:30,399
(He starts to see the view around after giving up the sunrise.)

1229
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:32,209
Isn't it so pretty?

1230
00:42:32,769 --> 00:42:33,779
I know.

1231
00:42:34,839 --> 00:42:36,409
When you stand still,

1232
00:42:36,539 --> 00:42:39,748
you can hear the rain making noise.

1233
00:42:39,749 --> 00:42:41,249
- The sound of the raindrops?
- Yes.

1234
00:42:41,379 --> 00:42:43,248
You can hear the rain falling into the water.

1235
00:42:43,249 --> 00:42:45,089
(The two run while enjoying the morning view.)

1236
00:42:45,449 --> 00:42:47,589
- Should we make a turn there?
- Okay.

1237
00:42:48,159 --> 00:42:49,519
That'll be almost 5km.

1238
00:42:50,259 --> 00:42:52,429
We've run 2.32km so far.

1239
00:42:52,629 --> 00:42:54,328
(Lodging, halfway point, lighthouse)

1240
00:42:54,329 --> 00:42:57,299
(They ran about 20 minutes and reached the halfway point.)

1241
00:42:57,929 --> 00:42:59,429
Turn.

1242
00:42:59,729 --> 00:43:01,069
(Let's go.)

1243
00:43:01,369 --> 00:43:03,939
(They pass the halfway point at 6:40am.)

1244
00:43:04,169 --> 00:43:06,169
When you work out in the morning,

1245
00:43:06,909 --> 00:43:08,908
don't you go back to sleep afterward?

1246
00:43:08,909 --> 00:43:09,979
(Laughing)

1247
00:43:10,279 --> 00:43:12,308
- I fall asleep no matter what.
- I see.

1248
00:43:12,309 --> 00:43:13,655
(It looks like it isn't the case for Bo Gum.)

1249
00:43:13,679 --> 00:43:15,679
- You get sleepy. Yes.
- Right?

1250
00:43:15,779 --> 00:43:17,148
The day before yesterday,

1251
00:43:17,149 --> 00:43:18,618
I told you that I ran 10km.

1252
00:43:18,619 --> 00:43:20,589
- I ran in the morning.
- Right.

1253
00:43:20,659 --> 00:43:21,919
Since it's a marathon.

1254
00:43:22,019 --> 00:43:24,459
- Did you participate in a marathon?
- Yes. The Disney Run.

1255
00:43:24,989 --> 00:43:26,229
- The Disney Run?
- Yes.

1256
00:43:26,429 --> 00:43:29,859
- It was Korea's first Disney Run.
- Exactly.

1257
00:43:29,999 --> 00:43:33,769
The characters from the studio were on the back of the T-shirts.

1258
00:43:33,899 --> 00:43:35,638
- It was random.
- I see.

1259
00:43:35,639 --> 00:43:37,208
Isn't it crazy?

1260
00:43:37,209 --> 00:43:38,668
Which character did you get?

1261
00:43:38,669 --> 00:43:39,769
Daisy Duck.

1262
00:43:40,139 --> 00:43:42,479
It's so adorable.

1263
00:43:42,679 --> 00:43:44,049
Was it your first marathon?

1264
00:43:44,249 --> 00:43:47,249
I participated in the Nike Run in May.

1265
00:43:47,379 --> 00:43:48,618
So, it was my second time.

1266
00:43:48,619 --> 00:43:49,619
(It was my second time.)

1267
00:43:50,019 --> 00:43:52,989
When I ran the Nike Run, I was filming "Law and the City."

1268
00:43:53,219 --> 00:43:56,159
- I had run 7km to 8km before, - Right.

1269
00:43:56,189 --> 00:43:57,989
So I thought I'd be able to do it.

1270
00:43:58,089 --> 00:43:59,428
But it was my first time running 10km,

1271
00:43:59,429 --> 00:44:00,699
and I felt like dying.

1272
00:44:00,799 --> 00:44:02,028
- At your 1st 10km marathon?
- Yes.

1273
00:44:02,029 --> 00:44:03,828
It was so hard.

1274
00:44:03,829 --> 00:44:05,299
But I didn't die.

1275
00:44:05,669 --> 00:44:07,199
- That's right.
- That's why...

1276
00:44:07,539 --> 00:44:10,099
Because I didn't die, it gives me courage...

1277
00:44:10,199 --> 00:44:11,439
to participate in the next one.

1278
00:44:11,539 --> 00:44:13,108
I did it anyway.

1279
00:44:13,109 --> 00:44:14,709
- You're right.
- I didn't die that day.

1280
00:44:15,739 --> 00:44:17,849
So, I thought I could run in the Disney Run too.

1281
00:44:18,009 --> 00:44:20,619
- The fact you finish the race...
- That's right.

1282
00:44:20,879 --> 00:44:22,719
- is already so...
- I don't feel greedy.

1283
00:44:23,819 --> 00:44:25,349
I don't need good records.

1284
00:44:26,189 --> 00:44:27,959
I don't desire anything, I just...

1285
00:44:28,089 --> 00:44:30,589
- Me too. I don't need good records.
- Right.

1286
00:44:31,059 --> 00:44:33,759
I just run with Sean every morning.

1287
00:44:33,789 --> 00:44:35,229
And we run 10km.

1288
00:44:35,799 --> 00:44:37,429
- Do you run 10km every morning?
- Yes.

1289
00:44:37,569 --> 00:44:38,669
- Gosh.
- So...

1290
00:44:39,069 --> 00:44:40,968
Sean asked me first about running together.

1291
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:42,115
(Sean asked me first about running together.)

1292
00:44:42,139 --> 00:44:44,839
He's the symbol of good influence.

1293
00:44:44,939 --> 00:44:46,509
He wants his successor.

1294
00:44:46,569 --> 00:44:48,339
(Laughing)

1295
00:44:48,379 --> 00:44:50,579
He needs to find the next Sean.

1296
00:44:50,909 --> 00:44:53,079
Bo Gum is the only option.

1297
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:56,578
- That's cool.
- I haven't been able to run lately.

1298
00:44:56,579 --> 00:44:57,619
(Busy schedule)

1299
00:44:57,649 --> 00:44:59,118
It's been a really long time...

1300
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:00,619
- since I ran in Korea.
- I know.

1301
00:45:01,189 --> 00:45:02,419
Good.

1302
00:45:04,089 --> 00:45:08,498
(They continue to run for a long time.)

1303
00:45:08,499 --> 00:45:10,259
- We're here.
- You're right.

1304
00:45:10,459 --> 00:45:13,199
(They are close to the lodging.)

1305
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:14,945
How many kilometers have we run?

1306
00:45:14,969 --> 00:45:16,499
We've run 4.64km.

1307
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:18,408
Let's run another 400m, then.

1308
00:45:18,409 --> 00:45:20,038
- Should we? To reach 5km?
- Should we?

1309
00:45:20,039 --> 00:45:21,239
- Should we run 5km?
- Yes.

1310
00:45:22,439 --> 00:45:24,248
Should we run to that red thing?

1311
00:45:24,249 --> 00:45:26,379
- Yes. Sounds good.
- To that white thing.

1312
00:45:26,649 --> 00:45:27,749
To the lighthouse?

1313
00:45:28,219 --> 00:45:29,719
Come to think of it,

1314
00:45:30,249 --> 00:45:31,919
when will we ever run together again?

1315
00:45:32,519 --> 00:45:34,719
This could be our first and the last time.

1316
00:45:34,759 --> 00:45:36,358
It won't be our last time.

1317
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:37,659
- Really?
- Yes.

1318
00:45:38,289 --> 00:45:39,409
We can run together again...

1319
00:45:39,629 --> 00:45:41,558
- whenever we want to.
- That's right.

1320
00:45:41,559 --> 00:45:43,458
"What are you doing today? What about tomorrow?"

1321
00:45:43,459 --> 00:45:44,659
We can run together like that.

1322
00:45:46,429 --> 00:45:47,569
We're at 5km!

1323
00:45:47,739 --> 00:45:49,769
(Excited)

1324
00:45:50,969 --> 00:45:52,908
We'll make a quick stop over there.

1325
00:45:52,909 --> 00:45:54,179
We'll stop for a second.

1326
00:45:54,939 --> 00:45:56,338
(Clicking)

1327
00:45:56,339 --> 00:45:58,549
(Striking a pose automatically)

1328
00:45:58,709 --> 00:46:00,608
(Checking the photo right away)

1329
00:46:00,609 --> 00:46:01,678
Okay.

1330
00:46:01,679 --> 00:46:02,749
(It's a pass.)

1331
00:46:03,749 --> 00:46:06,419
(It's Bo Gum's turn.)

1332
00:46:10,789 --> 00:46:13,589
(Standing tall)

1333
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:14,759
(Laughing)

1334
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:16,428
Are you going to stand still like that?

1335
00:46:16,429 --> 00:46:18,149
- I'll take a photo of you.
- Do something.

1336
00:46:18,329 --> 00:46:19,829
(Like this.)

1337
00:46:20,129 --> 00:46:22,299
(Or like this.)

1338
00:46:22,939 --> 00:46:23,939
(When you pretend to be happy, the photo will look good.)

1339
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:25,139
Let's laugh.

1340
00:46:26,069 --> 00:46:27,139
Good.

1341
00:46:29,879 --> 00:46:32,309
(With finishers' photos, )

1342
00:46:34,119 --> 00:46:35,348
(Bo Gum and Hye Young)

1343
00:46:35,349 --> 00:46:38,419
(Their early morning run is complete.)

1344
00:46:39,849 --> 00:46:43,819
(The greens wake up while embracing the morning dew.)

1345
00:46:44,459 --> 00:46:47,859
(It's the morning of the second day.)

1346
00:46:48,399 --> 00:46:51,399
(Running into Jung Bong who is enjoying the outside air)

1347
00:46:53,299 --> 00:46:55,339
(Me?)

1348
00:46:55,769 --> 00:46:58,008
(Good morning, everyone.)

1349
00:46:58,009 --> 00:47:00,539
(Starting a refreshing morning with happy Jung Bong)

1350
00:47:01,279 --> 00:47:03,539
(Min Ji suddenly springs up.)

1351
00:47:04,649 --> 00:47:08,349
(She stretches her sore body.)

1352
00:47:09,149 --> 00:47:11,549
(Then she makes the bed nice and clean.)

1353
00:47:12,619 --> 00:47:13,619
(Groaning)

1354
00:47:13,989 --> 00:47:16,689
(Kyung Pyo wakes up with a groan.)

1355
00:47:17,559 --> 00:47:19,928
(The YB's lodging, the living room on the 4th floor)

1356
00:47:19,929 --> 00:47:21,498
- Where did you go?
- Good morning.

1357
00:47:21,499 --> 00:47:23,159
- Did you have a good run?
- Hi.

1358
00:47:23,259 --> 00:47:24,768
- We bought some bread.
- Jae Hong.

1359
00:47:24,769 --> 00:47:25,899
Thank you.

1360
00:47:26,229 --> 00:47:28,098
(The running mates came back with the bread for everyone.)

1361
00:47:28,099 --> 00:47:29,969
- Something smells good.
- Have some bread.

1362
00:47:30,239 --> 00:47:31,438
Dumplings?

1363
00:47:31,439 --> 00:47:32,609
- Bread.
- Bread.

1364
00:47:32,709 --> 00:47:33,969
What's with the dumplings?

1365
00:47:34,139 --> 00:47:36,219
- We bought some bread.
- Dumplings sound delicious.

1366
00:47:36,439 --> 00:47:38,199
- You didn't sleep, Bo Gum?
- Did you do it?

1367
00:47:38,509 --> 00:47:40,979
- I ran.
- You're amazing.

1368
00:47:41,919 --> 00:47:43,279
Hey, Kyung Pyo.

1369
00:47:43,679 --> 00:47:44,819
Yes?

1370
00:47:45,719 --> 00:47:47,759
Are you all right?

1371
00:47:47,959 --> 00:47:49,059
Why?

1372
00:47:50,459 --> 00:47:53,059
I had never hated you.

1373
00:47:53,329 --> 00:47:54,759
Gosh. You snored so loud...

1374
00:47:55,759 --> 00:47:58,169
I thought a tank was passing by.

1375
00:47:58,529 --> 00:48:01,168
(Dong Hwi, Kyung Pyo)

1376
00:48:01,169 --> 00:48:06,209
(Kyung Pyo snored like a chainsaw last night.)

1377
00:48:08,209 --> 00:48:11,379
(Startled)

1378
00:48:14,849 --> 00:48:16,379
Everyone wakes up early, though.

1379
00:48:17,549 --> 00:48:19,389
Who just said everyone woke up early?

1380
00:48:19,819 --> 00:48:21,158
- Did you?
- What?

1381
00:48:21,159 --> 00:48:22,818
Did you say everyone woke up early, Kyung Pyo?

1382
00:48:22,819 --> 00:48:24,379
I couldn't sleep at all because of you.

1383
00:48:25,729 --> 00:48:26,928
(Sorry, Dong Hwi.)

1384
00:48:26,929 --> 00:48:28,459
Not even an hour.

1385
00:48:29,529 --> 00:48:31,329
I thought you set this place on fire.

1386
00:48:31,369 --> 00:48:33,198
- Hello.
- Good morning.

1387
00:48:33,199 --> 00:48:34,298
Hello. You're up.

1388
00:48:34,299 --> 00:48:36,138
- Of course, I'm up.
- Good morning.

1389
00:48:36,139 --> 00:48:38,115
(Dong Il and Sung Kyun have come to tour YB's place.)

1390
00:48:38,139 --> 00:48:40,208
- Gosh. This place is very nice.
- Morning.

1391
00:48:40,209 --> 00:48:42,038
- Do you want some coffee?
- Sounds good.

1392
00:48:42,039 --> 00:48:43,539
Goodness. This place is cozy.

1393
00:48:44,479 --> 00:48:46,248
- Do you want some ramyeon?
- Hey, you.

1394
00:48:46,249 --> 00:48:47,649
You slept on your right side.

1395
00:48:47,849 --> 00:48:49,449
(Embarrassed)

1396
00:48:49,949 --> 00:48:51,818
- Please have a piece.
- Okay.

1397
00:48:51,819 --> 00:48:53,339
(Checking the view outside the window)

1398
00:48:53,689 --> 00:48:55,318
It's amazing.

1399
00:48:55,319 --> 00:48:56,695
(The dads start touring the rooms.)

1400
00:48:56,719 --> 00:49:01,299
Guys, we had a serious talk yesterday.

1401
00:49:01,829 --> 00:49:04,298
I'll say it again since Hye Young and Bo Gum didn't hear it.

1402
00:49:04,299 --> 00:49:05,329
Okay.

1403
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:09,199
Because Kyung Pyo made a little contribution yesterday,

1404
00:49:09,539 --> 00:49:11,569
for the battle for second place today,

1405
00:49:12,169 --> 00:49:14,239
he'll try to take second place.

1406
00:49:14,839 --> 00:49:17,079
Jae Hong is in first place with Tchaikovsky.

1407
00:49:17,909 --> 00:49:19,979
(What is he talking about?)

1408
00:49:21,249 --> 00:49:22,848
I was shocked by Jae Hong.

1409
00:49:22,849 --> 00:49:24,918
- When he said the "byword..." - That was...

1410
00:49:24,919 --> 00:49:26,248
- The byword for probiotics?
- That was crazy.

1411
00:49:26,249 --> 00:49:27,918
- It's game over.
- He's a genius.

1412
00:49:27,919 --> 00:49:30,519
Honestly, if I did that, I went home after that.

1413
00:49:30,689 --> 00:49:31,989
"I'll get going, then."

1414
00:49:32,329 --> 00:49:33,958
- Seriously.
- I find it hilarious...

1415
00:49:33,959 --> 00:49:35,599
I get compliments for that.

1416
00:49:36,059 --> 00:49:38,398
Why couldn't I contribute anything today?

1417
00:49:38,399 --> 00:49:40,128
(Suddenly?)

1418
00:49:40,129 --> 00:49:41,638
- That's not it.
- That's what you wanted to say.

1419
00:49:41,639 --> 00:49:43,838
I really want to do something. Is there anything?

1420
00:49:43,839 --> 00:49:45,008
You do it tomorrow.

1421
00:49:45,009 --> 00:49:46,909
- Try harder tomorrow.
- Well...

1422
00:49:46,969 --> 00:49:48,508
- Tomorrow, - You have to respond well.

1423
00:49:48,509 --> 00:49:50,239
Let's compete for second place.

1424
00:49:50,409 --> 00:49:52,478
- First place is locked in.
- For second place.

1425
00:49:52,479 --> 00:49:54,649
- Jae Hong is in first place.
- Go for second place.

1426
00:49:55,579 --> 00:49:56,848
He wants your help. He wants us to set the mood.

1427
00:49:56,849 --> 00:49:57,948
(Conclusion)

1428
00:49:57,949 --> 00:50:00,118
I can't start when you tell everyone about it.

1429
00:50:00,119 --> 00:50:01,719
I had to team up with only a few.

1430
00:50:02,819 --> 00:50:04,179
It's for me to be in second place.

1431
00:50:04,959 --> 00:50:05,988
I want second place.

1432
00:50:05,989 --> 00:50:08,058
- What are you going to do?
- I don't know.

1433
00:50:08,059 --> 00:50:09,298
(Two actors are suspiciously wanting to get laughs so badly.)

1434
00:50:09,299 --> 00:50:11,129
- It's crazy.
- It has begun.

1435
00:50:11,799 --> 00:50:13,328
- It's tasty.
- I know.

1436
00:50:13,329 --> 00:50:15,768
(Enjoying bread for breakfast thanks to the runners)

1437
00:50:15,769 --> 00:50:17,198
I love having bread for breakfast.

1438
00:50:17,199 --> 00:50:18,519
- I see.
- I'm glad to hear that.

1439
00:50:18,839 --> 00:50:21,538
That's why Dong Il always says...

1440
00:50:21,539 --> 00:50:23,279
"M-bread."

1441
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:24,979
It's morning-bread.

1442
00:50:25,379 --> 00:50:26,708
M-bread.

1443
00:50:26,709 --> 00:50:27,879
(A reckless move)

1444
00:50:28,349 --> 00:50:29,548
You're still drunk, aren't you?

1445
00:50:29,549 --> 00:50:30,718
(Dong Il)

1446
00:50:30,719 --> 00:50:33,489
(Kyung Pyo is blinded by greed to make them laugh.)

1447
00:50:33,589 --> 00:50:34,958
He wants our help.

1448
00:50:34,959 --> 00:50:37,189
He thinks he had a little role yesterday.

1449
00:50:38,229 --> 00:50:40,829
Stop telling them everything.

1450
00:50:40,889 --> 00:50:43,728
- Don't. Come on.
- He's competing for second place.

1451
00:50:43,729 --> 00:50:45,468
He wants to be in second place.

1452
00:50:45,469 --> 00:50:47,129
(Enough.)

1453
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:49,599
I think we slept at 5am. Was it 5am?

1454
00:50:50,169 --> 00:50:51,868
- Because you were talking?
- Yes.

1455
00:50:51,869 --> 00:50:53,169
- Really?
- Yes.

1456
00:50:53,409 --> 00:50:55,739
Sung Kyun and I had limited topics to talk about.

1457
00:50:56,839 --> 00:50:58,808
(For the fathers, it was a bit hard to have a profound conversation.)

1458
00:50:58,809 --> 00:51:00,248
I can totally see it.

1459
00:51:00,249 --> 00:51:03,178
We sat on the beds...

1460
00:51:03,179 --> 00:51:05,318
- and talked for about 30 minutes.
- I see.

1461
00:51:05,319 --> 00:51:06,888
It wasn't fun for me, so I said, "Let's go to bed."

1462
00:51:06,889 --> 00:51:07,958
"Let's go to bed."

1463
00:51:07,959 --> 00:51:10,088
Exactly. Geez.

1464
00:51:10,089 --> 00:51:11,969
(They had a deep sleep which they didn't plan.)

1465
00:51:12,259 --> 00:51:13,729
- Hi.
- Hi.

1466
00:51:14,329 --> 00:51:16,158
Good morning, Mi Ran.

1467
00:51:16,159 --> 00:51:18,028
- Geez.
- Good morning.

1468
00:51:18,029 --> 00:51:19,328
What's that jacket?

1469
00:51:19,329 --> 00:51:21,338
- Nice.
- They gave it to us yesterday.

1470
00:51:21,339 --> 00:51:22,668
(Mi Ran is wearing a windbreaker, celebrating 10th year anniversary.)

1471
00:51:22,669 --> 00:51:23,798
It was a windbreaker.

1472
00:51:23,799 --> 00:51:25,438
I forgot about it.

1473
00:51:25,439 --> 00:51:27,939
- I'm going to wear that too.
- Me too.

1474
00:51:28,609 --> 00:51:29,878
(Hye Young grabs the windbreaker.)

1475
00:51:29,879 --> 00:51:31,309
(Satisfied)

1476
00:51:31,849 --> 00:51:35,149
(Min Ji doesn't forget to wear it too.)

1477
00:51:35,449 --> 00:51:37,479
- They don't have 2XL, do they?
- I don't know.

1478
00:51:38,749 --> 00:51:41,389
(It's exciting to wear the team uniform.)

1479
00:51:41,689 --> 00:51:43,488
- Should we go downstairs?
- Come downstairs.

1480
00:51:43,489 --> 00:51:46,169
(They go downstairs to play a game while wearing the windbreakers.)

1481
00:51:46,889 --> 00:51:48,029
Good morning.

1482
00:51:48,899 --> 00:51:50,858
Good morning. Hello.

1483
00:51:50,859 --> 00:51:52,619
(Starting with Taek, who came down first...)

1484
00:51:52,729 --> 00:51:53,729
Geez.

1485
00:51:54,199 --> 00:51:56,869
What games will we play now? I'm worried.

1486
00:51:56,969 --> 00:51:58,108
What games are we going to play?

1487
00:51:58,109 --> 00:51:59,509
Exactly. I'm curious.

1488
00:52:00,209 --> 00:52:02,209
Moo Sung's stare is fierce right now.

1489
00:52:03,779 --> 00:52:07,819
Why don't you wear socks that cover your ankles, Moo Sung?

1490
00:52:08,219 --> 00:52:10,218
You look so cold.

1491
00:52:10,219 --> 00:52:11,818
I feel like I'm getting used to this after a day.

1492
00:52:11,819 --> 00:52:14,049
- Of course.
- It's not that bad.

1493
00:52:14,289 --> 00:52:16,059
What's really funny is...

1494
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:19,028
when we wrapped up the morning yesterday,

1495
00:52:19,029 --> 00:52:21,298
you told me, "I get it now. This is how it is."

1496
00:52:21,299 --> 00:52:24,428
When there were so many people at first, I was...

1497
00:52:24,429 --> 00:52:25,469
That's right.

1498
00:52:25,829 --> 00:52:27,069
Director Na.

1499
00:52:27,499 --> 00:52:29,469
Will you give Min Ji a sketchbook?

1500
00:52:29,699 --> 00:52:31,208
- Her voice...
- I lost my voice.

1501
00:52:31,209 --> 00:52:32,238
(An aftermath from yesterday)

1502
00:52:32,239 --> 00:52:34,409
I think I need a sketchbook to communicate.

1503
00:52:35,009 --> 00:52:36,508
Does she have a hoarse voice?

1504
00:52:36,509 --> 00:52:38,208
Really? Thank you.

1505
00:52:38,209 --> 00:52:39,649
Yes. That's better.

1506
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:41,218
(The example of how to use it)

1507
00:52:41,219 --> 00:52:42,319
(I'm very satisfied.)

1508
00:52:42,849 --> 00:52:45,449
Kyung Pyo, she's making a fast move.

1509
00:52:46,019 --> 00:52:48,619
I told you to stop. I'll take care of it on my own.

1510
00:52:48,689 --> 00:52:51,128
We have to compete fiercely for second place.

1511
00:52:51,129 --> 00:52:53,458
Kyung Pyo said he'd be fully prepared...

1512
00:52:53,459 --> 00:52:55,729
and have a stellar performance during this game.

1513
00:52:55,959 --> 00:52:57,328
- I'm in trouble.
- He's competing...

1514
00:52:57,329 --> 00:52:58,669
against Moo Sung and me.

1515
00:52:58,769 --> 00:52:59,868
(Surprised)

1516
00:52:59,869 --> 00:53:01,769
- What?
- Are you looking down on us?

1517
00:53:03,269 --> 00:53:05,309
Why are you having a fast start?

1518
00:53:05,439 --> 00:53:07,168
- You should bring it on too.
- It's a battle of the three.

1519
00:53:07,169 --> 00:53:08,209
What?

1520
00:53:08,539 --> 00:53:11,149
Moo Sung and Jae Myung practiced playing games,

1521
00:53:11,349 --> 00:53:12,448
- They practiced?
- instead of going to bed.

1522
00:53:12,449 --> 00:53:13,548
Because they didn't know what game we'd be playing.

1523
00:53:13,549 --> 00:53:15,519
- They're prepared.
- Really?

1524
00:53:15,679 --> 00:53:17,718
I played it in my head while lying down on my bed.

1525
00:53:17,719 --> 00:53:18,749
(Laughing)

1526
00:53:18,989 --> 00:53:21,119
I can be something about food again.

1527
00:53:21,259 --> 00:53:22,959
They were the games we already played.

1528
00:53:23,459 --> 00:53:25,888
How do you feel right now, Moo Sung,

1529
00:53:25,889 --> 00:53:26,988
after spending one day?

1530
00:53:26,989 --> 00:53:29,029
After getting a few questions right,

1531
00:53:29,229 --> 00:53:30,299
I'm excited for the game.

1532
00:53:30,659 --> 00:53:31,929
(Totally confident)

1533
00:53:32,129 --> 00:53:33,769
Kyung Pyo, we're not an easy match.

1534
00:53:34,299 --> 00:53:36,198
I'm getting more anxious about today.

1535
00:53:36,199 --> 00:53:37,699
(He's out of confidence.)

1536
00:53:38,039 --> 00:53:39,138
You've ruined everything.

1537
00:53:39,139 --> 00:53:41,178
- You told everyone about my plan.
- No. Let's take a short break.

1538
00:53:41,179 --> 00:53:43,979
Go and put a dove in your hat or something.

1539
00:53:44,109 --> 00:53:45,749
- A dove in my hat?
- Yes.

1540
00:53:46,379 --> 00:53:48,319
Anyway,

1541
00:53:48,619 --> 00:53:50,278
did you run in the morning?

1542
00:53:50,279 --> 00:53:52,618
- Yes, they did.
- Who? Who ran?

1543
00:53:52,619 --> 00:53:53,795
- Bo Gum and Hye Young.
- Bo Gum.

1544
00:53:53,819 --> 00:53:55,388
- Hye Young.
- Bo Gun and Hye Young.

1545
00:53:55,389 --> 00:53:56,488
You're truly amazing.

1546
00:53:56,489 --> 00:53:57,619
They bought bread too.

1547
00:53:57,829 --> 00:53:59,888
Where were the bread and coffee?

1548
00:53:59,889 --> 00:54:02,358
They were all right there if you would open the door.

1549
00:54:02,359 --> 00:54:03,458
You were the last to wake up.

1550
00:54:03,459 --> 00:54:05,498
Girl, you were the last one to wake up...

1551
00:54:05,499 --> 00:54:07,839
after making a fuss while splitting your legs.

1552
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:09,499
(Embarrassed)

1553
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:10,869
I did my best.

1554
00:54:11,439 --> 00:54:13,468
This is our second day.

1555
00:54:13,469 --> 00:54:16,178
Before we leave today,

1556
00:54:16,179 --> 00:54:17,678
we'll play a fun game.

1557
00:54:17,679 --> 00:54:20,448
- Then we'll eat.
- They're crazy about games.

1558
00:54:20,449 --> 00:54:22,148
Will it be the last game?

1559
00:54:22,149 --> 00:54:24,248
Before we reveal what game it is,

1560
00:54:24,249 --> 00:54:26,088
we'll divide into teams first.

1561
00:54:26,089 --> 00:54:27,958
- It'll be a new team.
- Yes.

1562
00:54:27,959 --> 00:54:29,588
Yesterday, we had three teams,

1563
00:54:29,589 --> 00:54:31,688
according to family.

1564
00:54:31,689 --> 00:54:33,989
Today, we'll divide into two teams.

1565
00:54:34,999 --> 00:54:36,158
That's what we'll do.

1566
00:54:36,159 --> 00:54:38,629
This side will be Team Sung Dong Il.

1567
00:54:39,199 --> 00:54:42,269
The other side will be Team Ahn Dong Il.

1568
00:54:43,099 --> 00:54:45,308
- Team Ahn Dong Il.
- With different last names?

1569
00:54:45,309 --> 00:54:47,069
The ones with different last names.

1570
00:54:47,209 --> 00:54:49,638
If there is someone who has the same last name,

1571
00:54:49,639 --> 00:54:51,408
you're in Team Sung Dong Il.

1572
00:54:51,409 --> 00:54:53,048
If you're the only one with your last name,

1573
00:54:53,049 --> 00:54:54,518
- you're in Team Ahn Dong Il.
- Good. I don't have to move.

1574
00:54:54,519 --> 00:54:55,578
You can move now.

1575
00:54:55,579 --> 00:54:58,018
There are many Kims and Lees. Wait, Chois.

1576
00:54:58,019 --> 00:54:59,718
- I'm Kim. You too.
- Kims and Lees.

1577
00:54:59,719 --> 00:55:00,748
Come here, Kim.

1578
00:55:00,749 --> 00:55:02,189
Kims and Lees.

1579
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:03,619
Jae Myung,

1580
00:55:04,159 --> 00:55:05,159
do we have the same last name?

1581
00:55:05,159 --> 00:55:06,159
You're Ryu, while I'm Yoo.

1582
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:07,759
- I see.
- So, you sit here.

1583
00:55:07,859 --> 00:55:11,128
Of course, Dong Il is in Team Sung Dong Il.

1584
00:55:11,129 --> 00:55:12,329
I see.

1585
00:55:12,899 --> 00:55:16,599
(People with the same last names and with different last names)

1586
00:55:16,639 --> 00:55:17,768
(Sung, Kim, Kim, Lee, Lee, Lee)

1587
00:55:17,769 --> 00:55:19,145
(Choi, Ahn, Park, Ryu, Ryu, Ra, Ko)

1588
00:55:19,169 --> 00:55:20,709
- Okay.
- You can sit here.

1589
00:55:21,069 --> 00:55:22,778
The three competitors are in the same team.

1590
00:55:22,779 --> 00:55:24,109
This is bad.

1591
00:55:24,209 --> 00:55:26,679
This isn't right. I'm in trouble.

1592
00:55:27,109 --> 00:55:28,719
How did they even sit like this?

1593
00:55:28,779 --> 00:55:30,649
(Laughing)

1594
00:55:30,879 --> 00:55:32,718
In the meantime,

1595
00:55:32,719 --> 00:55:35,518
- Jae Hong looks very relaxed.
- You're right.

1596
00:55:35,519 --> 00:55:37,889
- He is on top of everything.
- Exactly.

1597
00:55:38,029 --> 00:55:40,888
I'll play it in a bit relaxed manner.

1598
00:55:40,889 --> 00:55:42,229
I'm so jealous.

1599
00:55:43,329 --> 00:55:45,228
After this game,

1600
00:55:45,229 --> 00:55:47,998
you'll have lunch together before wrapping up.

1601
00:55:47,999 --> 00:55:50,168
We will play the game to compete...

1602
00:55:50,169 --> 00:55:51,838
- for the lunch menus.
- Sounds delicious.

1603
00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:53,338
Will you show them the food?

1604
00:55:53,339 --> 00:55:55,038
- Goodness.
- Geez.

1605
00:55:55,039 --> 00:55:56,378
This is torture.

1606
00:55:56,379 --> 00:55:57,509
Goodness.

1607
00:55:57,639 --> 00:55:58,978
- I'm so...
- Nice.

1608
00:55:58,979 --> 00:56:00,378
- The food is...
- What is that?

1609
00:56:00,379 --> 00:56:02,418
It's chicken, the classic one.

1610
00:56:02,419 --> 00:56:04,018
- And seasoned cockles.
- It's old-fashioned chicken.

1611
00:56:04,019 --> 00:56:05,448
- Awesome.
- And hamburg steak.

1612
00:56:05,449 --> 00:56:06,589
Cockles.

1613
00:56:06,689 --> 00:56:08,059
What is the white soup?

1614
00:56:08,659 --> 00:56:10,188
I think it's cream soup.

1615
00:56:10,189 --> 00:56:11,988
- I see.
- We've prepared...

1616
00:56:11,989 --> 00:56:13,288
- six dishes.
- Bibimbap!

1617
00:56:13,289 --> 00:56:14,558
Take a guess, everyone.

1618
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:16,758
- They're all related to you.
- It's bibimbap.

1619
00:56:16,759 --> 00:56:17,858
They're the food from our drama.

1620
00:56:17,859 --> 00:56:18,968
- They were in our drama.
- Right.

1621
00:56:18,969 --> 00:56:21,668
- Bibimbap.
- Mi Ran made them in the drama,

1622
00:56:21,669 --> 00:56:23,368
- You're right.
- didn't you?

1623
00:56:23,369 --> 00:56:26,308
- Because our family was well-off.
- Right.

1624
00:56:26,309 --> 00:56:28,908
That's bibim guksu, a Western-style mixed noodle dish.

1625
00:56:28,909 --> 00:56:31,109
- It's spaghetti.
- I see.

1626
00:56:31,239 --> 00:56:33,048
What's ghetti?

1627
00:56:33,049 --> 00:56:35,379
It's called spaghetti. It's American noodles.

1628
00:56:36,219 --> 00:56:40,619
(It tastes just like when she mixed it with her hand.)

1629
00:56:40,789 --> 00:56:43,659
- That looks good.
- And seasoned cockles,

1630
00:56:44,059 --> 00:56:46,858
- which Dong Il loved. And...
- They are seasoned cockles.

1631
00:56:46,859 --> 00:56:48,259
(Seasoned cockles)

1632
00:56:49,529 --> 00:56:51,058
(The multiple stories are the highlight...)

1633
00:56:51,059 --> 00:56:52,659
(of the seasoned cockles in Reply 1988.)

1634
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:54,329
Goodness, honey.

1635
00:56:54,469 --> 00:56:55,598
Bibimbap.

1636
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:57,469
(Jung Bong's bibimbap in a big metal bowl)

1637
00:56:59,139 --> 00:57:03,209
(Jung Bong, a bibimbap lover, approves of it.)

1638
00:57:03,279 --> 00:57:04,538
(Thumbs up)

1639
00:57:04,539 --> 00:57:06,448
And the old-fashioned chicken.

1640
00:57:06,449 --> 00:57:07,908
- When was it shown in the drama?
- Yes.

1641
00:57:07,909 --> 00:57:09,979
(The old-fashioned chicken from the good old days)

1642
00:57:10,949 --> 00:57:13,619
Deok Sun, enjoy it.

1643
00:57:14,019 --> 00:57:16,389
Someone said it looked like a runny nose.

1644
00:57:17,059 --> 00:57:18,059
It's soup.

1645
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:19,689
(Soup in a large bowl)

1646
00:57:20,829 --> 00:57:24,129
Okay. Let's try this soup or sap.

1647
00:57:25,069 --> 00:57:27,699
We can take a bath in here for three days.

1648
00:57:28,569 --> 00:57:30,899
Mi Ran, where's the steak? Hurry!

1649
00:57:32,069 --> 00:57:34,309
(The much-anticipated last dish)

1650
00:57:34,439 --> 00:57:36,739
(Hamburg steak and young radish kimchi)

1651
00:57:36,879 --> 00:57:39,549
What's with the young radish kimchi? They don't belong here.

1652
00:57:39,779 --> 00:57:41,778
The steak is very greasy.

1653
00:57:41,779 --> 00:57:44,578
So, I made a fusion dish today.

1654
00:57:44,579 --> 00:57:46,288
- Help yourselves.
- Thanks for the food.

1655
00:57:46,289 --> 00:57:47,888
- Thank you.
- Thank you for the food.

1656
00:57:47,889 --> 00:57:50,189
(Mi Ran made the last dish herself.)

1657
00:57:51,019 --> 00:57:53,729
(But we don't see the young radish kimchi here.)

1658
00:57:54,259 --> 00:57:55,828
This is young radish kimchi.

1659
00:57:55,829 --> 00:57:57,129
(It's right next to it.)

1660
00:57:57,999 --> 00:58:00,329
We have young radish kimchi. Goodness.

1661
00:58:00,869 --> 00:58:02,839
What? It has a breathing hole.

1662
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:06,409
Maybe it stays better here because there's a hole to breathe.

1663
00:58:06,569 --> 00:58:08,639
I guess it allows the air to go in and out.

1664
00:58:08,839 --> 00:58:10,279
Let me try it.

1665
00:58:10,679 --> 00:58:11,949
That looks good.

1666
00:58:13,509 --> 00:58:14,819
(Exclaiming)

1667
00:58:15,019 --> 00:58:16,178
(Exclaiming)

1668
00:58:16,179 --> 00:58:17,349
This is good.

1669
00:58:18,149 --> 00:58:19,748
- This is good.
- Yes.

1670
00:58:19,749 --> 00:58:24,389
(The fresh young radish kimchi completes the last dish.)

1671
00:58:25,629 --> 00:58:27,088
- The hamburg steak.
- That's right.

1672
00:58:27,089 --> 00:58:28,729
Which one is the hamburg steak, Jae Hong?

1673
00:58:28,859 --> 00:58:30,428
The hamburg steak is...

1674
00:58:30,429 --> 00:58:31,545
(He gets up without hesitation.)

1675
00:58:31,569 --> 00:58:32,968
With the young radish kimchi...

1676
00:58:32,969 --> 00:58:34,028
(Serious)

1677
00:58:34,029 --> 00:58:36,498
The oriental and the western cultures are combined.

1678
00:58:36,499 --> 00:58:37,538
- For example, - For example,

1679
00:58:37,539 --> 00:58:38,539
the Hellenistic style.

1680
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:40,709
It feels like trying Hellenism culture.

1681
00:58:41,009 --> 00:58:43,739
(The same line and the same face even after 10 years)

1682
00:58:43,809 --> 00:58:44,809
(Laughing)

1683
00:58:44,810 --> 00:58:46,378
Jae Hong.

1684
00:58:46,379 --> 00:58:47,908
- Good job.
- Hellenism.

1685
00:58:47,909 --> 00:58:49,048
Kyung Pyo, how are you going to beat that?

1686
00:58:49,049 --> 00:58:50,219
Look at Kyung Pyo's face.

1687
00:58:50,349 --> 00:58:51,418
Hellenism.

1688
00:58:51,419 --> 00:58:53,149
(Unlikely to be funny today)

1689
00:58:53,689 --> 00:58:55,589
And here.

1690
00:58:56,719 --> 00:58:58,258
One team might not be able to...

1691
00:58:58,259 --> 00:58:59,788
- eat anything.
- No.

1692
00:58:59,789 --> 00:59:02,729
- In that case, - The emergency crops.

1693
00:59:02,759 --> 00:59:04,458
You're lying.

1694
00:59:04,459 --> 00:59:05,928
Are they steamed?

1695
00:59:05,929 --> 00:59:07,199
Thank you.

1696
00:59:09,399 --> 00:59:11,569
Let's hurry up before they get cold.

1697
00:59:11,709 --> 00:59:15,339
- Now, shall we reveal the game?
- Yes.

1698
00:59:15,639 --> 00:59:18,378
This game will determine...

1699
00:59:18,379 --> 00:59:21,919
how loyal you've been to your career.

1700
00:59:22,679 --> 00:59:25,948
Bo Gum, do you watch Korean movies and dramas a lot?

1701
00:59:25,949 --> 00:59:27,818
(Do you watch Korean movies and dramas a lot?)

1702
00:59:27,819 --> 00:59:29,459
You have no chance.

1703
00:59:29,989 --> 00:59:31,358
- He can't lie.
- He can't lie.

1704
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:32,728
- Be honest with me.
- He's so honest.

1705
00:59:32,729 --> 00:59:33,758
Park Bo Gum,

1706
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:34,798
- the conscience of the era.
- He can't lie.

1707
00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:37,559
Do you watch Korean movies and dramas a lot?

1708
00:59:38,229 --> 00:59:39,429
Only the ones I appeared in.

1709
00:59:40,469 --> 00:59:42,268
- He's so honest.
- I knew it.

1710
00:59:42,269 --> 00:59:43,768
- So conscientious.
- So conscientious.

1711
00:59:43,769 --> 00:59:44,909
(Laughing)

1712
00:59:45,269 --> 00:59:46,408
This game is...

1713
00:59:46,409 --> 00:59:47,808
the Famous Line Quiz.

1714
00:59:47,809 --> 00:59:49,289
- The famous line.
- The famous line.

1715
00:59:49,779 --> 00:59:53,408
(A picture of a scene will be shown.)

1716
00:59:53,409 --> 00:59:55,849
(For example)

1717
00:59:57,879 --> 00:59:58,889
Here it is.

1718
00:59:59,019 --> 01:00:00,288
"Do you even eat?"

1719
01:00:00,289 --> 01:00:01,349
Correct.

1720
01:00:01,789 --> 01:00:04,459
There are foreign movies too.

1721
01:00:05,189 --> 01:00:06,989
(4 people from each team will play together.)

1722
01:00:07,059 --> 01:00:08,429
Team Ahn Dong Il.

1723
01:00:08,599 --> 01:00:09,699
- Correct.
- Correct.

1724
01:00:10,729 --> 01:00:13,999
(The person who answers it will move to the back.)

1725
01:00:14,499 --> 01:00:17,599
(The first team to have all 4 people leave wins.)

1726
01:00:18,269 --> 01:00:19,869
(It'll be a round of 3.)

1727
01:00:20,469 --> 01:00:24,109
(Every time they win, they can choose 2 dishes.)

1728
01:00:24,409 --> 01:00:27,279
(The team that doesn't win a single round will have steamed potatoes.)

1729
01:00:27,809 --> 01:00:29,078
Do we get salt with potatoes?

1730
01:00:29,079 --> 01:00:30,479
We'll give you both salt and sugar.

1731
01:00:30,719 --> 01:00:33,189
Pick four members from each team.

1732
01:00:33,389 --> 01:00:34,865
- Then...
- To guess the famous line?

1733
01:00:34,889 --> 01:00:36,219
Are you good with the lines?

1734
01:00:36,519 --> 01:00:37,719
- Because I'm not.
- No.

1735
01:00:39,759 --> 01:00:41,089
I'm sorry,

1736
01:00:41,289 --> 01:00:42,799
give up on the two of us.

1737
01:00:43,499 --> 01:00:45,069
We must win this game.

1738
01:00:45,199 --> 01:00:47,068
- So the four of you should play.
- Okay.

1739
01:00:47,069 --> 01:00:48,768
- The 4 of you, move forward.
- The 4 of us.

1740
01:00:48,769 --> 01:00:50,268
- Okay.
- For now...

1741
01:00:50,269 --> 01:00:51,745
(Dong Hwi, Min Ji, Sung Kyun, and Sun Young play in Round 1.)

1742
01:00:51,769 --> 01:00:53,309
(Team Sung Ahn Dong Il)

1743
01:00:53,369 --> 01:00:54,369
Jae Myung.

1744
01:00:54,370 --> 01:00:56,179
I think I'll be able to remember a few.

1745
01:00:56,279 --> 01:00:57,685
What about you? Are you feeling confident?

1746
01:00:57,709 --> 01:00:59,408
- It looks like I have to play.
- Play for now.

1747
01:00:59,409 --> 01:01:01,249
- Play for now.
- Kyung Pyo, Jae Myung...

1748
01:01:01,509 --> 01:01:02,748
- You.
- Yes, me.

1749
01:01:02,749 --> 01:01:03,778
You.

1750
01:01:03,779 --> 01:01:05,389
- Let's do that.
- Okay.

1751
01:01:05,519 --> 01:01:06,888
You have to play again in the next round anyway.

1752
01:01:06,889 --> 01:01:08,358
- I...
- Yes.

1753
01:01:08,359 --> 01:01:09,959
- Okay.
- We have to play anyway.

1754
01:01:09,989 --> 01:01:11,288
See? Look at them.

1755
01:01:11,289 --> 01:01:12,459
We're guaranteed to win.

1756
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:15,358
But she watches dramas at home.

1757
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:17,229
Right. She watches TV so much.

1758
01:01:17,259 --> 01:01:19,568
- She watches it over and over.
- But the famous lines are hard.

1759
01:01:19,569 --> 01:01:21,669
- Right.
- She watches it over and over.

1760
01:01:21,839 --> 01:01:23,639
- So, are you ready?
- Yes.

1761
01:01:23,969 --> 01:01:25,008
You are?

1762
01:01:25,009 --> 01:01:26,208
- Team Sung Dong Il.
- Team Sung Dong Il.

1763
01:01:26,209 --> 01:01:27,608
(Team Sung Dong Il)

1764
01:01:27,609 --> 01:01:28,908
- You are?
- Team Ahn Dong Il.

1765
01:01:28,909 --> 01:01:29,938
Team Sung Ahn Dong Il.

1766
01:01:29,939 --> 01:01:31,648
- That's too hard.
- Team Sung Ahn Dong Il.

1767
01:01:31,649 --> 01:01:32,708
Let's go with Team Ahn Dong Il.

1768
01:01:32,709 --> 01:01:34,048
- Team Ahn Dong Il.
- Team Ahn Dong Il.

1769
01:01:34,049 --> 01:01:35,849
(Team Ahn Dong Il)

1770
01:01:36,149 --> 01:01:37,278
Min Ji?

1771
01:01:37,279 --> 01:01:38,919
- Min Ji.
- You don't have to write that.

1772
01:01:39,719 --> 01:01:40,749
Team Sung Dong Il.

1773
01:01:41,319 --> 01:01:42,459
The first question.

1774
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:44,189
Here it is.

1775
01:01:47,229 --> 01:01:48,869
- Team Sung Dong Il.
- Team Sung Dong Il.

1776
01:01:49,299 --> 01:01:50,728
- To the room of the truth.
- You got it.

1777
01:01:50,729 --> 01:01:52,269
("The Outlaws")

1778
01:01:52,669 --> 01:01:54,528
(The smile of the truth)

1779
01:01:54,529 --> 01:01:55,599
What?

1780
01:01:56,369 --> 01:01:58,449
- Oh, I'm getting dizzy.
- To the room of the truth.

1781
01:01:58,669 --> 01:02:00,809
- We couldn't beat that.
- Good job.

1782
01:02:01,269 --> 01:02:02,478
Awesome.

1783
01:02:02,479 --> 01:02:03,778
- You can't take it yet.
- No.

1784
01:02:03,779 --> 01:02:04,978
Not yet?

1785
01:02:04,979 --> 01:02:06,985
- After all four people get it.
- Oh, I didn't know.

1786
01:02:07,009 --> 01:02:08,678
What?

1787
01:02:08,679 --> 01:02:09,818
I can't try it again?

1788
01:02:09,819 --> 01:02:12,189
- No.
- I feel like I'll be good at it.

1789
01:02:12,589 --> 01:02:14,218
- You can't give them a hint.
- Okay.

1790
01:02:14,219 --> 01:02:15,858
If you feel pity...

1791
01:02:15,859 --> 01:02:18,088
- or get too immersed...
- She can't help it.

1792
01:02:18,089 --> 01:02:19,328
- She has the temper.
- She has emotions.

1793
01:02:19,329 --> 01:02:22,329
- "She has the temper." - Yes. She has the temper.

1794
01:02:22,459 --> 01:02:24,299
Then I can't even say Team Sung Dong Il?

1795
01:02:26,029 --> 01:02:27,709
- Why would you say that?
- Why would you?

1796
01:02:28,639 --> 01:02:30,738
This game is so much fun.

1797
01:02:30,739 --> 01:02:32,209
- Awesome.
- Awesome.

1798
01:02:32,269 --> 01:02:33,639
Are you ready?

1799
01:02:34,009 --> 01:02:35,108
Here's the next question.

1800
01:02:35,109 --> 01:02:36,439
(The second famous scene)

1801
01:02:38,949 --> 01:02:40,179
Oh, what is that?

1802
01:02:40,509 --> 01:02:41,719
What is that?

1803
01:02:41,849 --> 01:02:42,948
"My Love from the Star."

1804
01:02:42,949 --> 01:02:44,378
- That's Cheon Song Yi.
- "My Love from the Star."

1805
01:02:44,379 --> 01:02:46,119
That's Cheon Song Yi.

1806
01:02:46,419 --> 01:02:48,558
- Team Ahn Dong Il.
- Team Ahn Dong Il said it first.

1807
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:50,289
"I'm Cheon Song Yi."

1808
01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:51,988
Wrong. That's not it.

1809
01:02:51,989 --> 01:02:53,258
- I got it.
- I got it.

1810
01:02:53,259 --> 01:02:54,389
- Yes?
- Lee Min Ji.

1811
01:02:54,529 --> 01:02:57,059
My name is Cheon Song Yi

1812
01:02:57,099 --> 01:02:58,499
- Close, but wrong.
- Cheon Song Yi

1813
01:02:58,929 --> 01:03:00,829
- My name is Cheon Song Yi - While driving,

1814
01:03:01,529 --> 01:03:02,638
she sings.

1815
01:03:02,639 --> 01:03:03,898
Team Sung Dong Il.

1816
01:03:03,899 --> 01:03:05,438
Cheon Song Yi is rapping

1817
01:03:05,439 --> 01:03:06,808
Hong hong hong

1818
01:03:06,809 --> 01:03:08,809
- Correct.
- Correct. Nice.

1819
01:03:09,179 --> 01:03:10,679
Good job.

1820
01:03:11,379 --> 01:03:13,879
- I have to get up.
- Good job.

1821
01:03:13,949 --> 01:03:15,919
You must watch so much TV.

1822
01:03:16,319 --> 01:03:18,078
One person from each team left.

1823
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:19,448
I'm sorry, but Ko Kyung Pyo.

1824
01:03:19,449 --> 01:03:21,788
I'm sorry, but I didn't see it.

1825
01:03:21,789 --> 01:03:24,059
When are you going to participate?

1826
01:03:24,319 --> 01:03:25,658
Do you know what he said yesterday?

1827
01:03:25,659 --> 01:03:26,688
"Hey, Hye Ri."

1828
01:03:26,689 --> 01:03:28,259
"Just make a good reaction."

1829
01:03:28,929 --> 01:03:31,928
(I told you to make only reactions.)

1830
01:03:31,929 --> 01:03:33,528
If he says anything?

1831
01:03:33,529 --> 01:03:35,998
How can I make any reaction when he's not doing anything?

1832
01:03:35,999 --> 01:03:37,168
Hey, the game...

1833
01:03:37,169 --> 01:03:38,769
We're not even halfway through yet.

1834
01:03:38,869 --> 01:03:40,308
Give him a chance, will you?

1835
01:03:40,309 --> 01:03:41,909
Yes, give him a chance.

1836
01:03:42,409 --> 01:03:44,709
Then to help Kyung Pyo get it...

1837
01:03:45,309 --> 01:03:46,348
(Shouting)

1838
01:03:46,349 --> 01:03:47,378
(Finally a chance for him?)

1839
01:03:47,379 --> 01:03:48,718
- Team Ahn Dong Il.
- Team Ahn Dong Il.

1840
01:03:48,719 --> 01:03:50,019
Please.

1841
01:03:50,549 --> 01:03:52,388
"Have Mojito in Maldives."

1842
01:03:52,389 --> 01:03:54,019
- Wrong.
- It's the other way around.

1843
01:03:54,289 --> 01:03:55,988
- The other way around.
- Wrong.

1844
01:03:55,989 --> 01:03:56,989
Wrong.

1845
01:03:56,990 --> 01:03:58,558
Team Sung Dong Il.

1846
01:03:58,559 --> 01:03:59,659
Team Sung Dong Il.

1847
01:03:59,889 --> 01:04:01,059
"Have Maldives..."

1848
01:04:01,999 --> 01:04:03,259
"in Mojito."

1849
01:04:03,329 --> 01:04:04,429
Correct.

1850
01:04:05,069 --> 01:04:06,429
Oh, right.

1851
01:04:06,999 --> 01:04:08,539
He said it correctly?

1852
01:04:09,139 --> 01:04:10,768
- Thank you, Kyung Pyo.
- That's a bummer.

1853
01:04:10,769 --> 01:04:12,268
Why did you say it right?

1854
01:04:12,269 --> 01:04:13,909
What happened?

1855
01:04:14,909 --> 01:04:17,178
Team Sung Dong Il is getting ahead.

1856
01:04:17,179 --> 01:04:18,648
- The next question.
- I told you.

1857
01:04:18,649 --> 01:04:21,078
The speed matters for this question.

1858
01:04:21,079 --> 01:04:22,478
- Hey. Be ready.
- I can't get ready.

1859
01:04:22,479 --> 01:04:24,219
It must be something everyone knows.

1860
01:04:24,919 --> 01:04:26,019
Here it is.

1861
01:04:28,049 --> 01:04:29,689
- Team Sung Dong Il.
- Team Sung Dong Il.

1862
01:04:30,159 --> 01:04:31,928
"It's the sweet potato."

1863
01:04:31,929 --> 01:04:33,029
Correct.

1864
01:04:33,589 --> 01:04:35,459
(Bummer)

1865
01:04:36,159 --> 01:04:38,159
"The sweet potato."

1866
01:04:38,499 --> 01:04:39,968
"Yes, the potato sweet."

1867
01:04:39,969 --> 01:04:41,699
"Mother, the sweet potato."

1868
01:04:41,939 --> 01:04:43,369
(Who are you?)

1869
01:04:43,539 --> 01:04:45,439
"Yes, the potato sweet."

1870
01:04:46,009 --> 01:04:48,809
"Mother, the sweet potato."

1871
01:04:48,979 --> 01:04:50,509
"Yes. It's the sweet potato."

1872
01:04:50,779 --> 01:04:52,009
(Perfect)

1873
01:04:52,149 --> 01:04:53,249
"Happy now?"

1874
01:04:53,979 --> 01:04:55,009
(Impressed)

1875
01:04:55,149 --> 01:04:56,718
(The answer)

1876
01:04:56,719 --> 01:04:58,749
- The potato sweet...
- The sweet potato.

1877
01:04:58,789 --> 01:05:00,249
Yes. The sweet...

1878
01:05:01,589 --> 01:05:02,819
The sweet?

1879
01:05:03,219 --> 01:05:05,558
- The sweet potato...
- The sweet potato.

1880
01:05:05,559 --> 01:05:06,789
The sweet potato!

1881
01:05:08,599 --> 01:05:11,328
The elder of the Ras.

1882
01:05:11,329 --> 01:05:12,829
I should've done that.

1883
01:05:12,899 --> 01:05:15,198
"I should've done that?"

1884
01:05:15,199 --> 01:05:16,399
("I should've done that?")

1885
01:05:17,899 --> 01:05:19,308
Now,

1886
01:05:19,309 --> 01:05:21,879
only Min Ji remains in this team.

1887
01:05:21,939 --> 01:05:23,338
This round...

1888
01:05:23,339 --> 01:05:25,449
- might determine the result.
- You must get it.

1889
01:05:26,149 --> 01:05:27,349
Here we go.

1890
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:29,179
Here it is.

1891
01:05:30,679 --> 01:05:32,218
- Here it is.
- Team Ahn Dong Il.

1892
01:05:32,219 --> 01:05:33,919
- Team Ahn Dong Il.
- He got it.

1893
01:05:34,219 --> 01:05:35,589
It's that one.

1894
01:05:36,089 --> 01:05:37,389
- This is bad.
- That's not it.

1895
01:05:37,419 --> 01:05:38,419
Three...

1896
01:05:38,420 --> 01:05:39,588
"How can love change?"

1897
01:05:39,589 --> 01:05:40,759
- Hurry.
- That's right.

1898
01:05:40,829 --> 01:05:42,759
- That's wrong.
- You need to count.

1899
01:05:42,799 --> 01:05:43,959
"How can love change?"

1900
01:05:44,159 --> 01:05:47,428
(Yeong Seok hesitates for some reason.)

1901
01:05:47,429 --> 01:05:49,038
(From "One Fine Spring Day")

1902
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:50,539
How could love change?

1903
01:05:50,669 --> 01:05:51,939
"How can love change?"

1904
01:05:52,209 --> 01:05:54,239
(Only the order is different.)

1905
01:05:54,469 --> 01:05:56,309
(Yeong Seok hesitates.)

1906
01:05:56,409 --> 01:05:57,679
- Hurry.
- That's right.

1907
01:05:57,879 --> 01:05:58,908
- That's wrong.
- You need to count.

1908
01:05:58,909 --> 01:06:00,748
- That's wrong.
- That's wrong.

1909
01:06:00,749 --> 01:06:01,749
That's wrong.

1910
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:02,848
- He got the ending wrong.
- That's wrong.

1911
01:06:02,849 --> 01:06:04,079
How can love...

1912
01:06:04,749 --> 01:06:05,889
How can love...

1913
01:06:06,149 --> 01:06:07,448
(Using his fatal skills)

1914
01:06:07,449 --> 01:06:09,119
How can it change?

1915
01:06:09,819 --> 01:06:11,258
(Trembling)

1916
01:06:11,259 --> 01:06:13,389
(As he puts presents trembling emotional acting, )

1917
01:06:14,229 --> 01:06:17,859
(the other team approves without a question.)

1918
01:06:18,059 --> 01:06:19,199
How can it change?

1919
01:06:19,569 --> 01:06:20,699
- How can it...
- Correct.

1920
01:06:20,829 --> 01:06:22,769
(Touched)

1921
01:06:22,999 --> 01:06:24,568
- With that much emotion...
- We will...

1922
01:06:24,569 --> 01:06:25,768
- With that much emotion...
- We will reenact it.

1923
01:06:25,769 --> 01:06:28,009
It's, "How could love change."

1924
01:06:28,509 --> 01:06:29,879
How could love change?

1925
01:06:32,279 --> 01:06:33,909
Do you want to come in for ramyeon?

1926
01:06:34,509 --> 01:06:35,678
(Okay. Cut.)

1927
01:06:35,679 --> 01:06:36,819
Good job.

1928
01:06:36,879 --> 01:06:40,348
(A scene of a complete waste of skills)

1929
01:06:40,349 --> 01:06:43,089
That means this team...

1930
01:06:43,219 --> 01:06:45,588
- I did it.
- I'm going to get addicted to it.

1931
01:06:45,589 --> 01:06:47,059
Are you ready?

1932
01:06:47,089 --> 01:06:48,159
It's neck-and-neck.

1933
01:06:49,799 --> 01:06:51,428
- Here it is.
- Team Ahn Dong Il.

1934
01:06:51,429 --> 01:06:52,775
Team Ahn Dong Il. I said it first.

1935
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:54,298
- Here it is.
- Team Ahn Dong Il.

1936
01:06:54,299 --> 01:06:56,138
- Team Ahn Dong Il. I said it first.
- Team Ahn Dong Il said it first.

1937
01:06:56,139 --> 01:06:58,809
"Why is the restaurant thriving?"

1938
01:06:58,939 --> 01:07:00,108
Correct.

1939
01:07:00,109 --> 01:07:01,109
("Extreme Job")

1940
01:07:01,169 --> 01:07:02,609
- Correct.
- No.

1941
01:07:03,179 --> 01:07:04,709
- I didn't say it like that.
- No?

1942
01:07:04,739 --> 01:07:05,978
No?

1943
01:07:05,979 --> 01:07:08,008
The original actor...

1944
01:07:08,009 --> 01:07:10,089
- The original actor...
- I didn't say it like that.

1945
01:07:10,479 --> 01:07:11,918
I'm the original actor.

1946
01:07:11,919 --> 01:07:12,988
I didn't say it like that.

1947
01:07:12,989 --> 01:07:14,448
- That doesn't count.
- If you don't approve...

1948
01:07:14,449 --> 01:07:15,959
How did you do it?

1949
01:07:16,319 --> 01:07:18,989
Why is the restaurant thriving?

1950
01:07:19,189 --> 01:07:20,459
It's the same.

1951
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:21,729
Isn't that the same?

1952
01:07:22,229 --> 01:07:23,798
(What's the difference?)

1953
01:07:23,799 --> 01:07:27,198
What is... Why is the restaurant thriving?

1954
01:07:27,199 --> 01:07:28,768
- It's the same.
- What's the difference?

1955
01:07:28,769 --> 01:07:30,138
- Let me try it one more time.
- Is impression different?

1956
01:07:30,139 --> 01:07:31,745
Only the person is different, but it's the same...

1957
01:07:31,769 --> 01:07:33,568
(We don't know why they're doing this match.)

1958
01:07:33,569 --> 01:07:35,538
It's completely different.

1959
01:07:35,539 --> 01:07:36,579
Try.

1960
01:07:38,039 --> 01:07:40,809
(This is the end.)

1961
01:07:41,149 --> 01:07:42,418
(The fathers love it.)

1962
01:07:42,419 --> 01:07:43,679
- Right.
- It's the same.

1963
01:07:44,049 --> 01:07:45,348
(Dramatically agreeing that Kyung Pyo got it)

1964
01:07:45,349 --> 01:07:46,419
Okay.

1965
01:07:46,619 --> 01:07:48,249
(Remaining members)

1966
01:07:48,349 --> 01:07:50,789
- Jung Bong, let's go.
- Okay.

1967
01:07:50,959 --> 01:07:53,688
Now, it's a match between Jae Hong and Min Ji.

1968
01:07:53,689 --> 01:07:55,158
- It's neck-and-neck.
- Jung Bong.

1969
01:07:55,159 --> 01:07:56,459
It's a couple's match.

1970
01:07:56,859 --> 01:07:58,059
A couple's match.

1971
01:07:58,329 --> 01:07:59,898
- Let's go.
- Ahn Jae Hong's not answering...

1972
01:07:59,899 --> 01:08:02,438
- on purpose to take the spotlight.
- To the end.

1973
01:08:02,439 --> 01:08:04,138
He's so sly.

1974
01:08:04,139 --> 01:08:06,408
- He's full of ambition.
- He's so ambitious.

1975
01:08:06,409 --> 01:08:09,579
Let's end the last match with this.

1976
01:08:09,939 --> 01:08:11,239
Here it is.

1977
01:08:15,209 --> 01:08:16,378
Okay. Min Ji.

1978
01:08:16,379 --> 01:08:19,218
"Why is my name Deok Sun?"

1979
01:08:19,219 --> 01:08:21,349
Wrong. That's wrong.

1980
01:08:21,689 --> 01:08:23,859
- "Why is it Sung Deok Sun?" - Wrong.

1981
01:08:24,089 --> 01:08:25,688
- Team Ahn Dong Il.
- That's wrong.

1982
01:08:25,689 --> 01:08:27,458
Min Ji didn't say the exact line.

1983
01:08:27,459 --> 01:08:28,698
No.

1984
01:08:28,699 --> 01:08:30,828
The original actor, please get up.

1985
01:08:30,829 --> 01:08:33,599
If Jae Hong says the line...

1986
01:08:33,869 --> 01:08:35,129
perfectly...

1987
01:08:35,299 --> 01:08:37,038
Hye Ri, are you ready to evaluate him?

1988
01:08:37,039 --> 01:08:38,638
- Of course. I'm always ready.
- On your conscience...

1989
01:08:38,639 --> 01:08:39,968
- Here we go. Ahn Jae Hong.
- You can do it.

1990
01:08:39,969 --> 01:08:43,079
Why am I Sung Deok Sun?

1991
01:08:45,349 --> 01:08:46,678
- What do you think?
- I was shocked.

1992
01:08:46,679 --> 01:08:47,679
(Behind her significant smile...)

1993
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:48,718
What does that mean?

1994
01:08:48,719 --> 01:08:50,478
(A little bummer?)

1995
01:08:50,479 --> 01:08:52,119
(Here is the answer.)

1996
01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:55,858
Why am I Deok Sun?

1997
01:08:55,859 --> 01:08:57,319
(They're both wrong.)

1998
01:08:57,659 --> 01:08:59,558
We have no choice,

1999
01:08:59,559 --> 01:09:01,588
but to move onto the next question.

2000
01:09:01,589 --> 01:09:02,728
- I agree.
- They're about the same, right?

2001
01:09:02,729 --> 01:09:05,058
They're too similar to decide.

2002
01:09:05,059 --> 01:09:06,168
Can you show us?

2003
01:09:06,169 --> 01:09:07,628
Let's see the original version before we move on.

2004
01:09:07,629 --> 01:09:09,598
- Show us the original version.
- The original version.

2005
01:09:09,599 --> 01:09:11,559
Let's see the original version before we move on.

2006
01:09:11,669 --> 01:09:12,708
On a chair?

2007
01:09:12,709 --> 01:09:14,009
(Synchronizing with Deok Sun)

2008
01:09:14,169 --> 01:09:15,709
She's immersing.

2009
01:09:15,779 --> 01:09:17,208
- The volume...
- Are you saying it to your dad?

2010
01:09:17,209 --> 01:09:18,879
The volume is on another level.

2011
01:09:18,979 --> 01:09:20,579
(Watch out for the loud voice.)

2012
01:09:20,749 --> 01:09:24,019
Why am I Deok Sun?

2013
01:09:26,049 --> 01:09:28,589
(Bursting into tears)

2014
01:09:28,649 --> 01:09:29,788
(In awe)

2015
01:09:29,789 --> 01:09:31,088
I approve.

2016
01:09:31,089 --> 01:09:33,028
- She's different.
- The original actor.

2017
01:09:33,029 --> 01:09:34,158
- She's...
- Her voice...

2018
01:09:34,159 --> 01:09:35,679
- She is different.
- She's different.

2019
01:09:36,159 --> 01:09:37,599
Oh, my. Hye Young behind you.

2020
01:09:38,159 --> 01:09:39,829
- Why?
- My goodness.

2021
01:09:40,569 --> 01:09:42,499
- Gosh.
- It's my favorite scene.

2022
01:09:43,799 --> 01:09:46,508
Why is the Icon of Optimism crying?

2023
01:09:46,509 --> 01:09:48,508
- I'm touched.
- Deok Sun's...

2024
01:09:48,509 --> 01:09:50,539
voice and sound.

2025
01:09:50,739 --> 01:09:52,278
- It's so sad.
- It's resonating.

2026
01:09:52,279 --> 01:09:54,179
- Right.
- It was sad.

2027
01:09:54,249 --> 01:09:56,449
(The 1st read-through 10 years ago)

2028
01:09:57,249 --> 01:10:00,049
(Even on the first day Hye Ri said it, )

2029
01:10:01,019 --> 01:10:03,959
(Bo Gum cried.)

2030
01:10:04,419 --> 01:10:05,929
It's making me cry.

2031
01:10:06,329 --> 01:10:09,059
(On the day she acted it out...)

2032
01:10:09,329 --> 01:10:11,659
Because I'm younger, it's sad.

2033
01:10:12,669 --> 01:10:14,199
I get immersed.

2034
01:10:15,299 --> 01:10:18,599
(Hye Young cried.)

2035
01:10:18,809 --> 01:10:22,308
Sometimes when I can't focus while acting,

2036
01:10:22,309 --> 01:10:24,379
- then I watch that scene.
- Oh, my.

2037
01:10:24,839 --> 01:10:27,079
- You were there.
- Yes.

2038
01:10:28,249 --> 01:10:29,548
- I'm sorry, but...
- Don't cry, Moo Sung.

2039
01:10:29,549 --> 01:10:30,848
Why are you crying?

2040
01:10:30,849 --> 01:10:31,849
What?

2041
01:10:32,149 --> 01:10:34,148
I'm sorry, but don't pretend to cry.

2042
01:10:34,149 --> 01:10:35,558
(Laughing)

2043
01:10:35,559 --> 01:10:36,688
"Pretend to cry."

2044
01:10:36,689 --> 01:10:37,719
Good job.

2045
01:10:38,219 --> 01:10:40,429
- I agree.
- What's wrong?

2046
01:10:40,829 --> 01:10:41,829
I'm touched.

2047
01:10:42,999 --> 01:10:45,228
The final's been carried forward.

2048
01:10:45,229 --> 01:10:46,528
Min Ji and Jae Hong.

2049
01:10:46,529 --> 01:10:48,198
- Yes.
- It's the last round.

2050
01:10:48,199 --> 01:10:49,539
It's a foreign movie.

2051
01:10:49,669 --> 01:10:50,968
A foreign movie.

2052
01:10:50,969 --> 01:10:52,069
Here it is.

2053
01:10:54,109 --> 01:10:55,138
Come on. That's so easy.

2054
01:10:55,139 --> 01:10:56,685
- Team Ahn Dong Il.
- Team Ahn Dong Il.

2055
01:10:56,709 --> 01:10:59,009
(Jung Bong, are you...)

2056
01:10:59,079 --> 01:11:00,609
Do I have to say it in English?

2057
01:11:01,279 --> 01:11:02,719
I am Dobby.

2058
01:11:03,149 --> 01:11:04,679
What are you saying? Wrong.

2059
01:11:04,949 --> 01:11:06,288
I am Dobby.

2060
01:11:06,289 --> 01:11:08,249
(Why is he introducing himself?)

2061
01:11:08,519 --> 01:11:09,618
- Min Ji.
- It's wrong?

2062
01:11:09,619 --> 01:11:11,658
- That's almost like Helicobacter.
- Dobby is free.

2063
01:11:11,659 --> 01:11:13,828
Correct.

2064
01:11:13,829 --> 01:11:14,829
(Team Sung Dong Il wins Round 1.)

2065
01:11:14,830 --> 01:11:16,629
"I am Dobby?" Seriously?

2066
01:11:16,899 --> 01:11:17,899
Are you Dobby?

2067
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:19,969
You were just trying to be funny.

2068
01:11:20,329 --> 01:11:22,105
- We have to choose the dish.
- What should we choose?

2069
01:11:22,129 --> 01:11:23,438
How many can we pick?

2070
01:11:23,439 --> 01:11:24,738
- Two.
- Do we pick two?

2071
01:11:24,739 --> 01:11:25,968
Oh, two.

2072
01:11:25,969 --> 01:11:27,568
Bibimbap.

2073
01:11:27,569 --> 01:11:29,308
- Everything looks good.
- Aren't you playing?

2074
01:11:29,309 --> 01:11:31,539
Let's just get this.

2075
01:11:31,809 --> 01:11:34,178
- Sure. Sounds good.
- These two?

2076
01:11:34,179 --> 01:11:36,118
- Okay.
- Are you okay without cockles?

2077
01:11:36,119 --> 01:11:37,878
Even if they take cockles, they won't be able to finish it.

2078
01:11:37,879 --> 01:11:39,588
- That's true.
- That's true.

2079
01:11:39,589 --> 01:11:40,818
That's true.

2080
01:11:40,819 --> 01:11:42,688
- I knew he was smart.
- We'll take this.

2081
01:11:42,689 --> 01:11:43,818
Okay.

2082
01:11:43,819 --> 01:11:46,628
We'll take bibimbap and the hamburg steak.

2083
01:11:46,629 --> 01:11:47,928
The next team.

2084
01:11:47,929 --> 01:11:49,428
- The next team is up.
- That's awesome.

2085
01:11:49,429 --> 01:11:51,728
- Those who haven't played yet.
- Those who haven't played?

2086
01:11:51,729 --> 01:11:53,728
- Sun Young, you're up.
- She has to play for sure.

2087
01:11:53,729 --> 01:11:55,899
- You two haven't played yet.
- We have to play.

2088
01:11:55,969 --> 01:11:57,969
We need one more. Dong Hwi?

2089
01:11:58,069 --> 01:12:00,208
- Dong Hwi. Sure.
- I'll go.

2090
01:12:00,209 --> 01:12:01,638
- The reaction...
- From this team,

2091
01:12:01,639 --> 01:12:03,938
Hye Ri and Sung Dong Il newly joined.

2092
01:12:03,939 --> 01:12:04,939
Yes.

2093
01:12:05,479 --> 01:12:07,779
The conscience of the era...

2094
01:12:08,279 --> 01:12:09,378
and Hye Young.

2095
01:12:09,379 --> 01:12:10,678
(Newbie 1, 2, 3)

2096
01:12:10,679 --> 01:12:12,948
- Kyung Pyo, get the cockles.
- Okay.

2097
01:12:12,949 --> 01:12:14,019
Here we go.

2098
01:12:14,319 --> 01:12:17,189
(The first famous scene)

2099
01:12:17,519 --> 01:12:19,389
Are you ready? The first question.

2100
01:12:19,759 --> 01:12:20,829
I can't see.

2101
01:12:20,929 --> 01:12:21,988
The first question.

2102
01:12:21,989 --> 01:12:23,928
Wait. Moo Sung...

2103
01:12:23,929 --> 01:12:26,068
- He can't see.
- He can't see.

2104
01:12:26,069 --> 01:12:27,098
I'll approach.

2105
01:12:27,099 --> 01:12:28,599
Why don't you move forward?

2106
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:31,239
It's embarrassing to do that from the beginning.

2107
01:12:31,769 --> 01:12:33,608
It's embarrassing to do this from the beginning.

2108
01:12:33,609 --> 01:12:34,709
(Quietly simulating)

2109
01:12:34,939 --> 01:12:36,738
I'll approach him if it's something I know.

2110
01:12:36,739 --> 01:12:38,279
(Give me a break.)

2111
01:12:38,409 --> 01:12:39,809
Here we go.

2112
01:12:40,609 --> 01:12:41,609
Here it is.

2113
01:12:43,249 --> 01:12:44,879
(Sun Woo and Jin Ju in "Reply 1988")

2114
01:12:45,719 --> 01:12:46,919
(Moo Sung dashes.)

2115
01:12:47,249 --> 01:12:48,419
Oh, I have no idea.

2116
01:12:49,259 --> 01:12:51,089
- What is that?
- Kyung Pyo.

2117
01:12:51,919 --> 01:12:53,489
- Hey, that's you.
- That's you.

2118
01:12:54,329 --> 01:12:56,128
I think you have to sing.

2119
01:12:56,129 --> 01:12:57,498
But I don't know the lyrics.

2120
01:12:57,499 --> 01:12:59,129
- No one?
- Team Sung Dong Il.

2121
01:12:59,199 --> 01:13:00,568
- Mother. Finally, the mom.
- Mother.

2122
01:13:00,569 --> 01:13:01,698
The mom comes forward.

2123
01:13:01,699 --> 01:13:03,199
"Sally the Witch?"

2124
01:13:03,499 --> 01:13:04,538
Wrong. That's not it.

2125
01:13:04,539 --> 01:13:06,709
- Team Ahn Sung Il.
- Who's Ahn Sung Il?

2126
01:13:06,769 --> 01:13:07,838
Team Sung Dong Il.

2127
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:09,208
He said Sung Dong Il.

2128
01:13:09,209 --> 01:13:10,909
"Magical Princess Minky Momo."

2129
01:13:11,439 --> 01:13:13,279
Wrong. It's not that song.

2130
01:13:13,379 --> 01:13:14,978
- Do you not remember?
- I don't remember.

2131
01:13:14,979 --> 01:13:16,059
I can't remember it at all.

2132
01:13:16,779 --> 01:13:19,419
(The song Jin Ju sings in the drama)

2133
01:13:19,589 --> 01:13:23,158
Even though the mom and the son are here,

2134
01:13:23,159 --> 01:13:25,318
- it's best to reveal the answer.
- Yes.

2135
01:13:25,319 --> 01:13:27,129
I'll play the answer for you.

2136
01:13:27,189 --> 01:13:28,388
Play the answer.

2137
01:13:28,389 --> 01:13:30,028
(From "The Mysterious Cities of Gold")

2138
01:13:30,029 --> 01:13:31,529
This is from the show.

2139
01:13:32,299 --> 01:13:34,728
Oh, that's right.

2140
01:13:34,729 --> 01:13:38,099
(Unlike Mom who recalls it immediately...)

2141
01:13:38,399 --> 01:13:39,808
He doesn't know even after listening to it.

2142
01:13:39,809 --> 01:13:41,769
- It's so old.
- "The Mysterious Cities of Gold."

2143
01:13:43,479 --> 01:13:48,009
(At that moment, someone approaches them.)

2144
01:13:49,249 --> 01:13:50,549
Is that a name of ointment?

2145
01:13:54,274 --> 01:13:55,643
He doesn't know even after listening to it.

2146
01:13:55,644 --> 01:13:57,604
- It's so old.
- "The Mysterious Cities of Gold."

2147
01:13:59,384 --> 01:14:03,884
(At that moment, someone approaches them.)

2148
01:14:05,154 --> 01:14:06,424
Is that a name of ointment?

2149
01:14:15,364 --> 01:14:16,434
What?

2150
01:14:17,204 --> 01:14:18,904
- Oh, my goodness.
- Who is it?

2151
01:14:19,434 --> 01:14:21,303
(The last member of Ssangmun-dong)

2152
01:14:21,304 --> 01:14:23,203
- Who is it?
- Look who it is.

2153
01:14:23,204 --> 01:14:25,004
- No way.
- Come here.

2154
01:14:25,104 --> 01:14:27,713
- Oh, my.
- Kyung Pyo's sister is here.

2155
01:14:27,714 --> 01:14:29,813
Nice to meet you.

2156
01:14:29,814 --> 01:14:30,883
- I can't believe it.
- Have a seat.

2157
01:14:30,884 --> 01:14:32,383
(Kim Seol as Sung Jin Ju)

2158
01:14:32,384 --> 01:14:33,384
Is anyone sitting there?

2159
01:14:33,385 --> 01:14:36,454
Come here. Have a seat.

2160
01:14:37,284 --> 01:14:38,284
(Unlike the neighbors who are glad to see her...)

2161
01:14:38,285 --> 01:14:39,924
My goodness.

2162
01:14:40,494 --> 01:14:41,824
This is unbelievable.

2163
01:14:44,764 --> 01:14:45,863
My gosh.

2164
01:14:45,864 --> 01:14:50,833
(Her family can't easily approach her.)

2165
01:14:50,834 --> 01:14:53,633
Why don't we sit down and talk?

2166
01:14:53,634 --> 01:14:55,603
Move down.

2167
01:14:55,604 --> 01:14:56,644
Oh, my.

2168
01:14:58,004 --> 01:15:00,114
- How old are you?
- I'm in Grade Eight.

2169
01:15:00,974 --> 01:15:02,484
Grade Eight?

2170
01:15:03,514 --> 01:15:04,684
Sun Young.

2171
01:15:05,184 --> 01:15:06,854
Why are you crying?

2172
01:15:09,584 --> 01:15:12,724
(Seol finds it strange because she was 5 at the time.)

2173
01:15:14,094 --> 01:15:15,923
- Kyung Pyo's crying too.
- Kyung Pyo's crying.

2174
01:15:15,924 --> 01:15:17,363
(Sun Young and Kyung Pyo remember the emotion clearly.)

2175
01:15:17,364 --> 01:15:20,134
- That family's crying.
- But why?

2176
01:15:20,294 --> 01:15:21,334
Tissue...

2177
01:15:21,894 --> 01:15:25,664
(They played a family in the drama.)

2178
01:15:26,904 --> 01:15:29,773
(Sun Woo's family was the closest in Ssangmun-dong.)

2179
01:15:29,774 --> 01:15:31,303
I'm leaving.

2180
01:15:31,304 --> 01:15:32,544
Jin Ju, I'm leaving.

2181
01:15:33,814 --> 01:15:35,214
Jin Ju, something wrong today?

2182
01:15:36,484 --> 01:15:39,753
(They spent a lot of time together during the shoot.)

2183
01:15:39,754 --> 01:15:41,184
- Okay.
- Okay.

2184
01:15:43,354 --> 01:15:44,383
Really?

2185
01:15:44,384 --> 01:15:46,693
- Again. Let's try again.
- Let's try again.

2186
01:15:46,694 --> 01:15:48,794
- Did I say that too late?
- Yes. Here we go.

2187
01:15:49,924 --> 01:15:53,594
(They're more fond of those memories.)

2188
01:15:56,364 --> 01:15:58,733
(To see Jin Ju all grown up after 10 years...)

2189
01:15:58,734 --> 01:16:00,733
You should cry too.

2190
01:16:00,734 --> 01:16:02,974
I feel like crying too.

2191
01:16:03,544 --> 01:16:05,573
(Everyone who was there cries.)

2192
01:16:05,574 --> 01:16:07,413
Oh, my. What's wrong? Why are you crying?

2193
01:16:07,414 --> 01:16:09,143
It's because you're crying.

2194
01:16:09,144 --> 01:16:12,114
- We had no father in the drama.
- Right.

2195
01:16:12,214 --> 01:16:15,513
We had a lot of sad events.

2196
01:16:15,514 --> 01:16:18,353
To have all three of us sitting here,

2197
01:16:18,354 --> 01:16:20,893
- we're getting emotional.
- That's right.

2198
01:16:20,894 --> 01:16:22,023
You're witty.

2199
01:16:22,024 --> 01:16:23,523
This is crazy. I don't normally...

2200
01:16:23,524 --> 01:16:26,094
- You got it. This is it.
- This is crazy.

2201
01:16:26,134 --> 01:16:28,033
You did it. That settles it.

2202
01:16:28,034 --> 01:16:29,804
That will beat Tchaikovsky.

2203
01:16:31,804 --> 01:16:33,933
But I never saw it coming.

2204
01:16:33,934 --> 01:16:35,604
True. I never saw it coming.

2205
01:16:35,944 --> 01:16:37,603
Let's first listen...

2206
01:16:37,604 --> 01:16:39,314
- to Kim Seol's introduction.
- Yes.

2207
01:16:39,614 --> 01:16:42,473
Hello. I'm Kim Seol who played Jin Ju.

2208
01:16:42,474 --> 01:16:45,044
I am now in Grade Eight.

2209
01:16:45,784 --> 01:16:48,654
(It's so good to see you.)

2210
01:16:48,854 --> 01:16:51,024
Did you know she was that eloquent?

2211
01:16:51,684 --> 01:16:54,423
She couldn't remember it.

2212
01:16:54,424 --> 01:16:56,564
- My daughter is her age.
- Right.

2213
01:16:56,924 --> 01:16:58,663
They don't remember that time.

2214
01:16:58,664 --> 01:17:01,364
I still remember the last day of the shoot.

2215
01:17:01,464 --> 01:17:04,403
The back view of her being carried away,

2216
01:17:04,404 --> 01:17:05,950
- sleeping on her mom's back.
- That's right.

2217
01:17:05,974 --> 01:17:08,974
It really felt like sending away my own daughter.

2218
01:17:09,844 --> 01:17:13,013
That's when I made up my mind...

2219
01:17:13,014 --> 01:17:15,544
that I shouldn't get that emotionally attached again.

2220
01:17:15,674 --> 01:17:17,314
It was so hard for me.

2221
01:17:17,444 --> 01:17:19,283
After then on, when there were child stars,

2222
01:17:19,284 --> 01:17:21,013
I purposely kept my distance...

2223
01:17:21,014 --> 01:17:22,853
when we weren't filming.

2224
01:17:22,854 --> 01:17:24,953
It was so hard to part when I got emotionally attached.

2225
01:17:24,954 --> 01:17:27,694
I still remember her getting carried away.

2226
01:17:27,754 --> 01:17:29,023
That scene.

2227
01:17:29,024 --> 01:17:30,193
You don't remember, do you?

2228
01:17:30,194 --> 01:17:31,194
(Laughing)

2229
01:17:32,634 --> 01:17:33,994
Goodness.

2230
01:17:34,134 --> 01:17:35,864
What about you, Kyung Pyo?

2231
01:17:35,964 --> 01:17:38,034
Are the memories coming back?

2232
01:17:38,104 --> 01:17:40,534
- I always held her in my arms.
- That's right.

2233
01:17:40,934 --> 01:17:41,934
- That's right.
- Did you?

2234
01:17:41,935 --> 01:17:43,704
But now,

2235
01:17:43,804 --> 01:17:45,244
she's so big now,

2236
01:17:45,344 --> 01:17:46,973
and I'm so happy to see her and surprised,

2237
01:17:46,974 --> 01:17:48,444
but I can't approach her.

2238
01:17:49,284 --> 01:17:51,004
- Like back then?
- I get what that's like.

2239
01:17:51,384 --> 01:17:52,783
It feels so weird.

2240
01:17:52,784 --> 01:17:54,913
It's not something good or sad.

2241
01:17:54,914 --> 01:17:57,084
It's a feeling I've never felt before.

2242
01:17:57,484 --> 01:17:58,824
She can suddenly...

2243
01:17:59,494 --> 01:18:00,623
She can suddenly...

2244
01:18:00,624 --> 01:18:02,053
talk so well now.

2245
01:18:02,054 --> 01:18:03,223
(She's tall and can speak clearly now.)

2246
01:18:03,224 --> 01:18:04,424
She's a grown-up now.

2247
01:18:05,064 --> 01:18:06,594
We heard that...

2248
01:18:06,664 --> 01:18:08,393
she's a very smart student.

2249
01:18:08,394 --> 01:18:09,904
She attends a school for the gifted.

2250
01:18:09,934 --> 01:18:11,963
Goodness.

2251
01:18:11,964 --> 01:18:14,673
I attended gifted programs through elementary school,

2252
01:18:14,674 --> 01:18:17,943
and now, I am attending another school for the gifted.

2253
01:18:17,944 --> 01:18:19,103
Goodness.

2254
01:18:19,104 --> 01:18:21,074
- Do you need to take a test?
- Yes.

2255
01:18:21,744 --> 01:18:23,014
(Good job)

2256
01:18:23,144 --> 01:18:24,383
Does that mean you study well?

2257
01:18:24,384 --> 01:18:25,643
Rather than studying well,

2258
01:18:25,644 --> 01:18:27,654
it's more about coming up with clever ideas.

2259
01:18:28,154 --> 01:18:29,484
(Gosh...)

2260
01:18:29,584 --> 01:18:31,853
Seol, could you give Kyung Pyo...

2261
01:18:31,854 --> 01:18:33,354
- a few of those...
- Yes?

2262
01:18:33,694 --> 01:18:34,793
- clever ideas?
- You're driving me crazy.

2263
01:18:34,794 --> 01:18:35,900
(Could you give some to Kyung Pyo?)

2264
01:18:35,924 --> 01:18:38,064
Do you not have any fun ideas, Seol?

2265
01:18:38,394 --> 01:18:39,893
- Some clever, funny ideas.
- Kyung Pyo needs them.

2266
01:18:39,894 --> 01:18:42,094
That requires a certain level of personal aptitude.

2267
01:18:42,734 --> 01:18:45,563
(Gosh!)

2268
01:18:45,564 --> 01:18:46,673
It's all good,

2269
01:18:46,674 --> 01:18:48,074
but if you say "personal aptitude,"

2270
01:18:48,434 --> 01:18:50,544
that makes me feel really small.

2271
01:18:50,574 --> 01:18:52,473
Then were you watching...

2272
01:18:52,474 --> 01:18:54,044
- from back there, Seol?
- Yes.

2273
01:18:54,644 --> 01:18:56,543
- Did you see everything?
- Yes.

2274
01:18:56,544 --> 01:18:57,584
Goodness.

2275
01:18:57,644 --> 01:18:59,554
Did you miss your mom...

2276
01:18:59,784 --> 01:19:01,184
more than your brother?

2277
01:19:01,714 --> 01:19:02,824
A bit.

2278
01:19:03,424 --> 01:19:06,154
Do you remember that scene?

2279
01:19:06,354 --> 01:19:07,793
I don't remember what that song was.

2280
01:19:07,794 --> 01:19:08,953
- You don't?
- No.

2281
01:19:08,954 --> 01:19:12,624
(Seol didn't know the answer, either.)

2282
01:19:12,994 --> 01:19:16,063
Seol ate a lot of things back then.

2283
01:19:16,064 --> 01:19:18,634
She was famous for her eating shows.

2284
01:19:18,964 --> 01:19:21,673
- Is there anything you remember?
- The...

2285
01:19:21,674 --> 01:19:23,803
giant carp-shaped dalgona.

2286
01:19:23,804 --> 01:19:25,020
(The giant carp-shaped dalgona)

2287
01:19:25,044 --> 01:19:26,844
- The one this big?
- Yes.

2288
01:19:27,414 --> 01:19:29,013
- Gosh.
- She ate it like this.

2289
01:19:29,014 --> 01:19:31,814
I remember my mouth feeling sore from eating it.

2290
01:19:32,784 --> 01:19:34,914
- It was too sweet?
- I'm sure it hurt.

2291
01:19:35,154 --> 01:19:38,623
I remember her eating the gimbap whole,

2292
01:19:38,624 --> 01:19:40,293
without slicing it,

2293
01:19:40,294 --> 01:19:42,824
- even when she's a baby.
- Right.

2294
01:19:43,024 --> 01:19:46,033
(That wasn't it...)

2295
01:19:46,034 --> 01:19:47,794
(Banana milk)

2296
01:19:47,994 --> 01:19:49,403
(Dalgona)

2297
01:19:49,404 --> 01:19:50,934
Guys, let me take Jin Ju.

2298
01:19:51,904 --> 01:19:54,203
(Sausage)

2299
01:19:54,204 --> 01:19:57,274
(Giant sausage)

2300
01:19:57,504 --> 01:19:59,814
(Jjondeugi)

2301
01:20:00,144 --> 01:20:02,444
Gosh, it's a snowman.

2302
01:20:02,744 --> 01:20:04,514
(Not a snowman, but ice cream)

2303
01:20:04,744 --> 01:20:07,283
(And Santa's gift box)

2304
01:20:07,284 --> 01:20:09,684
I told her that Santa didn't exist.

2305
01:20:09,984 --> 01:20:11,254
Can I have a bite?

2306
01:20:11,624 --> 01:20:14,493
No, Santa gave it to me.

2307
01:20:14,494 --> 01:20:15,554
Jin Ju,

2308
01:20:15,924 --> 01:20:17,394
it's from your mom.

2309
01:20:18,424 --> 01:20:20,294
Santa doesn't exist.

2310
01:20:21,294 --> 01:20:24,803
(Sandora's box was opened...)

2311
01:20:24,804 --> 01:20:26,133
"Santa doesn't exist."

2312
01:20:26,134 --> 01:20:27,134
Santa...

2313
01:20:27,135 --> 01:20:28,273
Does Santa still exist?

2314
01:20:28,274 --> 01:20:31,103
To be honest, I think that scene is the most memorable.

2315
01:20:31,104 --> 01:20:32,703
- It must have been quite a shock.
- See?

2316
01:20:32,704 --> 01:20:35,844
Everyone spoiled Jin Ju,

2317
01:20:35,914 --> 01:20:37,083
but she said "Santa doesn't exist,"

2318
01:20:37,084 --> 01:20:39,913
so I think it stuck deep in my mind.

2319
01:20:39,914 --> 01:20:41,414
- I'm sorry.
- Goodness.

2320
01:20:41,814 --> 01:20:43,124
Hye Young is crying.

2321
01:20:43,284 --> 01:20:46,123
Did you actually get shocked, then?

2322
01:20:46,124 --> 01:20:48,154
Actually, I wasn't that shocked...

2323
01:20:48,224 --> 01:20:51,063
because I was already suspecting his existence.

2324
01:20:51,064 --> 01:20:52,424
When you were five years old?

2325
01:20:52,794 --> 01:20:54,934
- She's gifted.
- She's gifted, for sure.

2326
01:20:54,994 --> 01:20:56,710
- She's gifted, for sure.
- It's because she's gifted.

2327
01:20:56,734 --> 01:20:59,033
Then, let's do it this way.

2328
01:20:59,034 --> 01:21:00,673
Since Seol is here,

2329
01:21:00,674 --> 01:21:02,204
for the third round,

2330
01:21:02,304 --> 01:21:05,143
she can join Team Sung Dong Il...

2331
01:21:05,144 --> 01:21:06,573
- to play the game.
- Sounds good.

2332
01:21:06,574 --> 01:21:08,373
Seol, you can watch from behind...

2333
01:21:08,374 --> 01:21:10,083
- and see how it goes.
- Okay.

2334
01:21:10,084 --> 01:21:12,213
Auntie will show you how it works, okay?

2335
01:21:12,214 --> 01:21:13,653
Here...

2336
01:21:13,654 --> 01:21:16,260
These are your four team members. Do you think they will win or lose?

2337
01:21:16,284 --> 01:21:17,953
- You need to win.
- Sure.

2338
01:21:17,954 --> 01:21:19,953
- "You need to win." - "You need to win."

2339
01:21:19,954 --> 01:21:21,293
Not "I think you will win."

2340
01:21:21,294 --> 01:21:23,463
- "You need to win." - You need to do well...

2341
01:21:23,464 --> 01:21:26,734
- in order to finally see Seol eat.
- Okay.

2342
01:21:26,934 --> 01:21:28,263
It's "Ahn Dong Il", right?

2343
01:21:28,264 --> 01:21:29,503
- "Ahn Dong Il." - "Ahn Dong Il."

2344
01:21:29,504 --> 01:21:30,903
It's "Sung Dong Il" and "Ahn Dong Il."

2345
01:21:30,904 --> 01:21:32,364
Let's go. Are you ready?

2346
01:21:32,664 --> 01:21:34,433
(Round 2, Back to the 1st famous scene)

2347
01:21:34,434 --> 01:21:35,534
Here it is.

2348
01:21:37,044 --> 01:21:38,073
Here it is.

2349
01:21:38,074 --> 01:21:39,544
- Sung Dong Il.
- Sung Dong Il?

2350
01:21:39,874 --> 01:21:41,074
Get into it.

2351
01:21:41,514 --> 01:21:42,744
"Another one..."

2352
01:21:43,414 --> 01:21:44,913
"from the bottom."

2353
01:21:44,914 --> 01:21:46,313
(Another one from the bottom.)

2354
01:21:46,314 --> 01:21:48,914
What do you mean, "Another one from the bottom?"

2355
01:21:49,754 --> 01:21:51,624
Ahn Dong Il.

2356
01:21:52,024 --> 01:21:54,253
"Why is your tongue still going on?"

2357
01:21:54,254 --> 01:21:55,794
"If you're scared, go and die."

2358
01:21:56,924 --> 01:21:58,863
Wrong. This scene is actually...

2359
01:21:58,864 --> 01:22:01,363
an internal monologue.

2360
01:22:01,364 --> 01:22:02,634
(Answer revealed)

2361
01:22:02,794 --> 01:22:04,403
(From the movie "Tazza", The air feels cold...)

2362
01:22:04,404 --> 01:22:06,574
(A blade comes straight for my heart.)

2363
01:22:07,204 --> 01:22:08,904
- Ahn Dong Il.
- Ahn Dong Il?

2364
01:22:09,074 --> 01:22:10,143
"Tell Madam Jeong..."

2365
01:22:10,144 --> 01:22:11,504
No.

2366
01:22:11,574 --> 01:22:13,413
(Closing his mouth shut)

2367
01:22:13,414 --> 01:22:14,443
Wrong.

2368
01:22:14,444 --> 01:22:15,813
- Sung Dong Il.
- Sung Dong Il?

2369
01:22:15,814 --> 01:22:17,844
(After Sun Woo, it is Mom's turn.)

2370
01:22:17,944 --> 01:22:19,113
"The air feels cold."

2371
01:22:19,114 --> 01:22:21,253
(It's right until here.)

2372
01:22:21,254 --> 01:22:22,853
- "The air feels cold." - Wrong.

2373
01:22:22,854 --> 01:22:24,023
- What?
- There's more.

2374
01:22:24,024 --> 01:22:25,184
- Ahn Dong Il.
- Ahn Dong Il?

2375
01:22:25,254 --> 01:22:26,354
"The air feels cold."

2376
01:22:26,494 --> 01:22:28,323
"A blade comes straight for my heart."

2377
01:22:28,324 --> 01:22:29,454
- Correct.
- Correct.

2378
01:22:29,764 --> 01:22:30,863
Hey, but...

2379
01:22:30,864 --> 01:22:33,264
I gave him the first part.

2380
01:22:33,594 --> 01:22:35,333
Sun Young, do you know what the conscience of the era said?

2381
01:22:35,334 --> 01:22:36,604
He's your son.

2382
01:22:37,504 --> 01:22:39,304
Why can't you let me have it?

2383
01:22:39,504 --> 01:22:41,173
You didn't do that when I asked for it...

2384
01:22:41,174 --> 01:22:42,674
yesterday.

2385
01:22:42,904 --> 01:22:45,203
- Bo Gum, that's disappointing.
- Why can't you let him have it?

2386
01:22:45,204 --> 01:22:47,373
It's been ten years since.

2387
01:22:47,374 --> 01:22:48,414
(I'll give you a heart.)

2388
01:22:48,474 --> 01:22:50,414
Let's move on to the next question.

2389
01:22:50,844 --> 01:22:52,083
(Round 2, Second famous scene)

2390
01:22:52,084 --> 01:22:53,154
Here it is.

2391
01:22:55,714 --> 01:22:57,653
- Sung Dong Il!
- Sung Dong Il was faster.

2392
01:22:57,654 --> 01:22:58,983
- What is that?
- What is it?

2393
01:22:58,984 --> 01:23:01,024
- Sung Dong Il!
- Please get up.

2394
01:23:01,394 --> 01:23:02,454
"Room 304?"

2395
01:23:02,794 --> 01:23:04,664
- Wrong!
- What was it?

2396
01:23:04,724 --> 01:23:05,924
What?

2397
01:23:06,124 --> 01:23:08,134
Where did she get that?

2398
01:23:08,494 --> 01:23:10,664
- "Room 304?" - Sung Dong Il.

2399
01:23:11,304 --> 01:23:12,403
This team was first.

2400
01:23:12,404 --> 01:23:13,473
"Hey, 3885..."

2401
01:23:13,474 --> 01:23:15,234
- It's not "3885." - No.

2402
01:23:15,604 --> 01:23:16,873
Sung Dong Il.

2403
01:23:16,874 --> 01:23:19,144
It's short, so you need to be precise.

2404
01:23:19,274 --> 01:23:22,473
(From the movie, "The Chaser", It's short, so listen carefully.)

2405
01:23:22,474 --> 01:23:24,513
Hey, 4885. It's you, right?

2406
01:23:24,514 --> 01:23:25,543
(It's not Room 304 or 3885.)

2407
01:23:25,544 --> 01:23:26,704
(Hey, 4885. It's you, right?)

2408
01:23:26,814 --> 01:23:28,883
"Hey, 4885. Right?"

2409
01:23:28,884 --> 01:23:31,023
Wrong! It's not "Right?"

2410
01:23:31,024 --> 01:23:32,084
This team.

2411
01:23:32,184 --> 01:23:34,354
- Three, two, one.
- "It's you, right? 4885."

2412
01:23:35,224 --> 01:23:36,723
- No?
- You need to be precise. Wrong.

2413
01:23:36,724 --> 01:23:38,444
- Sung Dong Il.
- This is driving me crazy.

2414
01:23:38,864 --> 01:23:40,294
"Hey, 4885."

2415
01:23:40,394 --> 01:23:42,263
Wrong! You can't do that.

2416
01:23:42,264 --> 01:23:43,864
- After that?
- "Hey, 4885."

2417
01:23:44,004 --> 01:23:45,533
- "Room 301." - "Is it you?"

2418
01:23:45,534 --> 01:23:46,604
Wrong!

2419
01:23:46,734 --> 01:23:48,334
- That's not it?
- That's not it?

2420
01:23:48,474 --> 01:23:50,343
- Ahn Dong Il.
- "Hey, 4885. It's you, right?"

2421
01:23:50,344 --> 01:23:51,504
Correct!

2422
01:23:53,074 --> 01:23:54,244
Gosh, "4885."

2423
01:23:54,344 --> 01:23:56,244
We got one, somehow.

2424
01:23:56,684 --> 01:23:58,083
"Room 304?"

2425
01:23:58,084 --> 01:23:59,654
Are you the landlord?

2426
01:23:59,854 --> 01:24:02,554
It's the room she stayed at last night.

2427
01:24:02,714 --> 01:24:03,884
Really?

2428
01:24:04,554 --> 01:24:06,154
It's currently 4 to 2.

2429
01:24:06,794 --> 01:24:08,423
Team Ahn Dong Il is taking the lead.

2430
01:24:08,424 --> 01:24:09,863
- Ahn Dong Il.
- Ahn Dong Il.

2431
01:24:09,864 --> 01:24:11,024
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

2432
01:24:12,764 --> 01:24:13,833
Let's start.

2433
01:24:13,834 --> 01:24:15,434
It was a very popular drama.

2434
01:24:15,594 --> 01:24:16,863
(Round 2, Third famous scene)

2435
01:24:16,864 --> 01:24:18,004
Here it is.

2436
01:24:19,834 --> 01:24:21,804
- Sung Dong Il!
- Ahn Dong Il.

2437
01:24:21,974 --> 01:24:23,903
What? Ahn Dong Il.

2438
01:24:23,904 --> 01:24:25,044
(Gibberish)

2439
01:24:25,274 --> 01:24:26,674
Sung Dong Il!

2440
01:24:26,844 --> 01:24:28,343
Sung Dong Il was fast.

2441
01:24:28,344 --> 01:24:30,024
(Team Sung Dong Il was fast and accurate.)

2442
01:24:31,584 --> 01:24:33,113
- Sit down, Room 304.
- Room 304.

2443
01:24:33,114 --> 01:24:34,484
- Room 304.
- Wait.

2444
01:24:34,684 --> 01:24:35,713
- "Why are you..." - Two...

2445
01:24:35,714 --> 01:24:37,083
- No, wait.
- Wrong.

2446
01:24:37,084 --> 01:24:38,584
- Wait...
- Ahn Dong Il.

2447
01:24:39,554 --> 01:24:41,194
"How can I do that?"

2448
01:24:41,524 --> 01:24:43,064
That's 80 points.

2449
01:24:43,124 --> 01:24:44,163
- Wrong.
- Wait.

2450
01:24:44,164 --> 01:24:45,263
What's the keyword?

2451
01:24:45,264 --> 01:24:48,693
Her looks seem to say that...

2452
01:24:48,694 --> 01:24:50,233
- she's not quite prepared.
- Sung Dong Il.

2453
01:24:50,234 --> 01:24:52,204
"This man is my man..."

2454
01:24:52,704 --> 01:24:54,403
- "Why can't you say that?" - "Why can't you say that?"

2455
01:24:54,404 --> 01:24:55,533
It's the line after that.

2456
01:24:55,534 --> 01:24:57,174
- It's the line after that.
- Is it?

2457
01:24:57,404 --> 01:24:58,473
(Gibberish)

2458
01:24:58,474 --> 01:24:59,844
- Ahn Dong Il.
- Ahn Dong Il.

2459
01:25:00,744 --> 01:25:02,173
"How can I do that looking like this?"

2460
01:25:02,174 --> 01:25:03,244
Correct!

2461
01:25:04,084 --> 01:25:05,713
- "Looking like this?" - "Looking like this?"

2462
01:25:05,714 --> 01:25:07,114
She's pretty like that, though.

2463
01:25:07,554 --> 01:25:08,753
That was good.

2464
01:25:08,754 --> 01:25:09,983
This is too much of a burden.

2465
01:25:09,984 --> 01:25:11,724
- Gosh, they're good.
- Now...

2466
01:25:12,424 --> 01:25:14,493
- What's with us?
- Come on.

2467
01:25:14,494 --> 01:25:16,364
- "Room 304." - Seol, we're sorry.

2468
01:25:16,394 --> 01:25:18,694
- I'm sorry.
- It did come to my mind, though.

2469
01:25:18,994 --> 01:25:20,293
"You need to win, Mother."

2470
01:25:20,294 --> 01:25:22,294
She came all this way. We can't feed her potatoes.

2471
01:25:22,534 --> 01:25:23,833
- Let's do this. Work hard.
- Seol.

2472
01:25:23,834 --> 01:25:25,203
Seol, how did it seem?

2473
01:25:25,204 --> 01:25:26,834
Could you tell some of them?

2474
01:25:26,934 --> 01:25:28,533
- Not one, right?
- But these dramas...

2475
01:25:28,534 --> 01:25:30,080
are from the olden days, so they are a bit confusing.

2476
01:25:30,104 --> 01:25:32,373
- "From the olden days?" - "Olden."

2477
01:25:32,374 --> 01:25:34,914
They were made before I was even born.

2478
01:25:35,244 --> 01:25:36,644
You're right.

2479
01:25:36,684 --> 01:25:39,014
You have only Bo Gum left.

2480
01:25:39,444 --> 01:25:40,753
Luckily, Bo Gum...

2481
01:25:40,754 --> 01:25:42,954
mainly watches his own movies.

2482
01:25:43,354 --> 01:25:45,983
Let's win against him one by one.

2483
01:25:45,984 --> 01:25:47,894
- That's good.
- Okay.

2484
01:25:48,694 --> 01:25:50,664
Let's go with this, since it's a movie.

2485
01:25:50,794 --> 01:25:51,964
- A movie?
- Okay.

2486
01:25:52,094 --> 01:25:53,934
Let's go. Here it is.

2487
01:25:56,064 --> 01:25:57,634
(At the sight of the popular piece, )

2488
01:25:57,964 --> 01:25:59,103
(the audience immediately reacts.)

2489
01:25:59,104 --> 01:26:00,804
It's a famous line.

2490
01:26:00,934 --> 01:26:02,574
"Decision to Leave."

2491
01:26:03,344 --> 01:26:05,574
- Sung Dong Il.
- Hye Ri.

2492
01:26:05,704 --> 01:26:07,113
"I'm ruined."

2493
01:26:07,114 --> 01:26:08,613
(I'm ruined.)

2494
01:26:08,614 --> 01:26:10,483
- That's not it.
- Is it Park Hae Il's line?

2495
01:26:10,484 --> 01:26:12,243
- Or is it Tang Wei's line?
- Whose line is it?

2496
01:26:12,244 --> 01:26:14,453
It's Tang Wei's line.

2497
01:26:14,454 --> 01:26:16,054
(Sighing)

2498
01:26:16,214 --> 01:26:17,854
(The film major is frustrated.)

2499
01:26:18,324 --> 01:26:19,684
- Ahn Dong Il.
- Ahn Dong Il.

2500
01:26:20,124 --> 01:26:21,253
Ahn Dong Il.

2501
01:26:21,254 --> 01:26:22,294
(Gasping)

2502
01:26:22,394 --> 01:26:25,494
(If Bo Gum gets it, Team Ahn Dong Il will win Round 2.)

2503
01:26:25,824 --> 01:26:27,293
It's Tang Wei's line, right?

2504
01:26:27,294 --> 01:26:28,364
(Blinking)

2505
01:26:28,464 --> 01:26:29,633
You like Tang Wei.

2506
01:26:29,634 --> 01:26:30,874
You even shot a movie together.

2507
01:26:30,904 --> 01:26:33,080
(Bo Gum and Tang Wei starred in the movie "Wonderland.")

2508
01:26:33,104 --> 01:26:34,904
"Am I that..."

2509
01:26:35,934 --> 01:26:37,774
- "bad?" - Correct!

2510
01:26:37,904 --> 01:26:38,943
That's right.

2511
01:26:38,944 --> 01:26:39,974
(Am I that bad?)

2512
01:26:40,114 --> 01:26:42,014
(He is even more shocked.)

2513
01:26:42,874 --> 01:26:44,543
(Team Ahn Dong Il wins Round 2.)

2514
01:26:44,544 --> 01:26:46,184
- Gosh!
- Hey.

2515
01:26:46,414 --> 01:26:47,513
Seol.

2516
01:26:47,514 --> 01:26:48,853
I'm sorry.

2517
01:26:48,854 --> 01:26:50,323
Our team is wiped out.

2518
01:26:50,324 --> 01:26:51,653
- It's wiped out.
- It's wiped out.

2519
01:26:51,654 --> 01:26:53,794
Are you all sitting there?

2520
01:26:53,824 --> 01:26:55,130
- Which ones should we choose?
- Cockles.

2521
01:26:55,154 --> 01:26:56,353
- Cockles.
- Yes, cockles are better.

2522
01:26:56,354 --> 01:26:57,664
We will take the cockles.

2523
01:26:57,824 --> 01:26:59,093
- Cockles and fried chicken.
- Cockles and fried chicken.

2524
01:26:59,094 --> 01:27:00,363
- Yes, cockles and chicken.
- Cockles and chicken.

2525
01:27:00,364 --> 01:27:02,524
(Team Ahn Dong Il, seasoned cockles and fried chicken)

2526
01:27:02,764 --> 01:27:07,204
The last one left on the menu is soup and spaghetti.

2527
01:27:07,404 --> 01:27:09,303
You don't have a limit anymore.

2528
01:27:09,304 --> 01:27:10,974
Anyone can come up.

2529
01:27:11,074 --> 01:27:12,943
Four members will team up...

2530
01:27:12,944 --> 01:27:14,844
and do the final round.

2531
01:27:15,174 --> 01:27:17,183
Why not just do it all together?

2532
01:27:17,184 --> 01:27:18,813
- Seven against seven?
- Yes, do it at once.

2533
01:27:18,814 --> 01:27:20,713
- Yes, let's do that.
- Sounds good.

2534
01:27:20,714 --> 01:27:22,330
- We need some mercy.
- Seven against seven.

2535
01:27:22,354 --> 01:27:24,053
- Seven against seven.
- Seven against seven.

2536
01:27:24,054 --> 01:27:25,583
- Five points.
- For five points.

2537
01:27:25,584 --> 01:27:26,924
- Okay.
- Five points.

2538
01:27:26,994 --> 01:27:28,893
Anyone can answer, and you can do it multiple times.

2539
01:27:28,894 --> 01:27:29,894
- Okay.
- Okay.

2540
01:27:29,895 --> 01:27:31,123
Seol can play, too.

2541
01:27:31,124 --> 01:27:32,794
- That's good.
- You can answer, Seol.

2542
01:27:33,064 --> 01:27:34,893
- Seol, good luck.
- Good luck.

2543
01:27:34,894 --> 01:27:36,393
You are our hope.

2544
01:27:36,394 --> 01:27:37,404
Do you watch dramas?

2545
01:27:37,734 --> 01:27:39,703
I have bad memories.

2546
01:27:39,704 --> 01:27:41,604
(Will Seol be able to help Team Sung Dong Il?)

2547
01:27:41,904 --> 01:27:43,544
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

2548
01:27:43,744 --> 01:27:44,744
Here it is.

2549
01:27:47,074 --> 01:27:49,044
- Sung Dong Il!
- Sung Dong Il!

2550
01:27:49,174 --> 01:27:51,284
- "You farty butt!" - Correct!

2551
01:27:52,244 --> 01:27:53,353
That was good.

2552
01:27:53,354 --> 01:27:55,414
- Good job.
- What was that?

2553
01:27:55,614 --> 01:27:57,083
"You farty butt!"

2554
01:27:57,084 --> 01:27:58,324
(She responds with a ceremony.)

2555
01:27:58,484 --> 01:28:00,594
(Her acting makes them marvel.)

2556
01:28:00,724 --> 01:28:02,393
- Is that you?
- It's me.

2557
01:28:02,394 --> 01:28:04,223
- Hae Ri.
- That's amazing.

2558
01:28:04,224 --> 01:28:05,293
Nice.

2559
01:28:05,294 --> 01:28:06,693
You farty butt!

2560
01:28:06,694 --> 01:28:08,433
"You farty butt!"

2561
01:28:08,434 --> 01:28:09,934
(Perfect synchronization)

2562
01:28:10,404 --> 01:28:13,273
You're very good at "pumpkin sweet potato" and "farty butt."

2563
01:28:13,274 --> 01:28:14,634
"Pumpkin sweet potato!"

2564
01:28:15,034 --> 01:28:16,803
"You farty butt!"

2565
01:28:16,804 --> 01:28:18,203
- You're a singer, for sure.
- I know.

2566
01:28:18,204 --> 01:28:20,684
- You have great voice projection.
- Yes, my voice projection.

2567
01:28:21,174 --> 01:28:22,243
It's 1 to 0.

2568
01:28:22,244 --> 01:28:25,313
Let's go with an old movie.

2569
01:28:25,314 --> 01:28:27,583
Watch carefully, Moo Sung and Jae Myung.

2570
01:28:27,584 --> 01:28:28,813
An old movie?

2571
01:28:28,814 --> 01:28:30,723
(Round 3, Second famous scene)

2572
01:28:30,724 --> 01:28:31,724
Here it is.

2573
01:28:34,294 --> 01:28:35,894
- Ahn Dong Il.
- Ahn Dong Il.

2574
01:28:36,724 --> 01:28:40,533
"When goodwill continues, people think they are entitled."

2575
01:28:40,534 --> 01:28:41,594
Correct!

2576
01:28:42,334 --> 01:28:43,363
(Team Ahn Dong Il gets a speedy answer!)

2577
01:28:43,364 --> 01:28:44,403
- Gosh.
- Good job.

2578
01:28:44,404 --> 01:28:46,873
Kyung Pyo, how could you get the answer?

2579
01:28:46,874 --> 01:28:48,103
What do you mean?

2580
01:28:48,104 --> 01:28:49,703
You need to get the answer wrong correctly.

2581
01:28:49,704 --> 01:28:51,043
You can't get it right.

2582
01:28:51,044 --> 01:28:53,513
Now, I'm getting in trouble for getting it right.

2583
01:28:53,514 --> 01:28:55,814
You should have said, "People think they are Dooly."

2584
01:28:56,074 --> 01:28:57,514
You should have gone with "Dooly."

2585
01:28:58,044 --> 01:29:00,054
What am I supposed to do?

2586
01:29:00,584 --> 01:29:02,284
(Sung Dong Il, 1: Ahn Dong Il, 1)

2587
01:29:02,384 --> 01:29:04,153
- Should we move on?
- Let's go.

2588
01:29:04,154 --> 01:29:06,823
For this, if you add the gesture,

2589
01:29:06,824 --> 01:29:08,384
- it will be nice.
- There's a gesture?

2590
01:29:08,654 --> 01:29:09,724
Here it is.

2591
01:29:11,824 --> 01:29:13,463
- Sung Dong Il.
- Sung Dong Il.

2592
01:29:13,464 --> 01:29:16,393
"Woo to the Young to the Woo. Dong to the Geu to the Rami."

2593
01:29:16,394 --> 01:29:17,474
- Correct!
- That was good.

2594
01:29:18,964 --> 01:29:20,634
(Sung Dong Il, 2: Ahn Dong Il, 1)

2595
01:29:20,834 --> 01:29:23,273
Seol, goodness.

2596
01:29:23,274 --> 01:29:25,443
(Good job, my daughter.)

2597
01:29:25,444 --> 01:29:26,873
Amazing.

2598
01:29:26,874 --> 01:29:29,143
- That's amazing.
- "Extraordinary Attorney Woo."

2599
01:29:29,144 --> 01:29:31,144
(They all clap at Seol's outstanding performance.)

2600
01:29:31,214 --> 01:29:32,683
- You raised your daughter well.
- How cute.

2601
01:29:32,684 --> 01:29:34,313
How cute.

2602
01:29:34,314 --> 01:29:36,314
Thank you.

2603
01:29:36,584 --> 01:29:37,584
That's cute.

2604
01:29:37,684 --> 01:29:39,053
(Round 3, 4th famous scene)

2605
01:29:39,054 --> 01:29:40,953
This one is...

2606
01:29:40,954 --> 01:29:43,463
The younger ones will know this easily.

2607
01:29:43,464 --> 01:29:44,493
It's a foreign movie.

2608
01:29:44,494 --> 01:29:45,623
- "A foreign movie?" - "A foreign movie?"

2609
01:29:45,624 --> 01:29:47,364
Here it is.

2610
01:29:49,534 --> 01:29:51,134
- Ahn Dong Il.
- Ahn Dong Il.

2611
01:29:53,104 --> 01:29:55,903
- Three.
- "Wingardium Leviosa."

2612
01:29:55,904 --> 01:29:57,744
- Correct.
- Gosh.

2613
01:29:58,004 --> 01:30:00,043
That was amazing.

2614
01:30:00,044 --> 01:30:01,373
That was amazing.

2615
01:30:01,374 --> 01:30:04,414
(The middle-aged muggle is impressed by the magical spell.)

2616
01:30:04,844 --> 01:30:06,583
- It's 2 against 2, a tie.
- Yes.

2617
01:30:06,584 --> 01:30:08,083
It's tense.

2618
01:30:08,084 --> 01:30:10,253
Yesterday, when we were playing as a family,

2619
01:30:10,254 --> 01:30:12,084
she got all the points deducted.

2620
01:30:12,284 --> 01:30:15,024
(The eldest daughter is doing well with another family.)

2621
01:30:15,324 --> 01:30:17,300
You ruined your family, and now you're doing well there.

2622
01:30:17,324 --> 01:30:20,264
(She thrives in social life.)

2623
01:30:20,564 --> 01:30:21,634
Should we do this?

2624
01:30:22,064 --> 01:30:24,163
- We will go with a recent drama.
- Okay.

2625
01:30:24,164 --> 01:30:25,304
Here it is.

2626
01:30:27,534 --> 01:30:28,733
- Ahn...
- Ahn Dong Il.

2627
01:30:28,734 --> 01:30:30,343
- Ahn Dong Il.
- It's me, again?

2628
01:30:30,344 --> 01:30:32,643
- Go on.
- Please get into it.

2629
01:30:32,644 --> 01:30:34,644
"Do you know how many grains of rice are in here?"

2630
01:30:34,914 --> 01:30:36,273
- Not quite.
- Wrong.

2631
01:30:36,274 --> 01:30:38,313
- Is it something else?
- You need the number, as well.

2632
01:30:38,314 --> 01:30:39,314
Answer? Lee Min Ji.

2633
01:30:39,315 --> 01:30:41,553
We need the number? There's a number?

2634
01:30:41,554 --> 01:30:42,584
Try it.

2635
01:30:42,684 --> 01:30:44,084
"How many grains of rice?"

2636
01:30:44,284 --> 01:30:45,524
Yes, and after that,

2637
01:30:45,724 --> 01:30:47,423
they say how many.

2638
01:30:47,424 --> 01:30:48,653
They mention that?

2639
01:30:48,654 --> 01:30:50,194
- "It's 218." - Wrong.

2640
01:30:51,924 --> 01:30:53,394
- There's a number?
- Ahn Dong Il.

2641
01:30:54,534 --> 01:30:55,534
How many?

2642
01:30:55,535 --> 01:30:56,834
The grains of rice.

2643
01:30:57,404 --> 01:30:58,434
How many?

2644
01:30:58,764 --> 01:31:01,733
Both the fish and the rice are portioned at exactly 15 grams each.

2645
01:31:01,734 --> 01:31:02,834
So, how many?

2646
01:31:04,144 --> 01:31:07,744
(How many grains of rice are needed for the sushi to be 15g?)

2647
01:31:08,114 --> 01:31:09,213
Just wing it.

2648
01:31:09,214 --> 01:31:10,383
- You should...
- Ahn Dong Il.

2649
01:31:10,384 --> 01:31:11,583
- Ahn Dong Il.
- The rice...

2650
01:31:11,584 --> 01:31:13,104
"Do you know how many grains of rice?"

2651
01:31:13,484 --> 01:31:14,653
"It's 280."

2652
01:31:14,654 --> 01:31:16,654
- No, it's not 280.
- Ahn Dong Il.

2653
01:31:17,424 --> 01:31:18,653
- Ahn Dong Il.
- Go on.

2654
01:31:18,654 --> 01:31:20,023
- They did it.
- You get the chance.

2655
01:31:20,024 --> 01:31:21,323
"How many? The rice."

2656
01:31:21,324 --> 01:31:23,424
"Do you know how many grains of rice? It's 270."

2657
01:31:23,594 --> 01:31:25,463
"It's 270?" Wrong.

2658
01:31:25,464 --> 01:31:27,394
(It is Team Ahn Dong Il's turn again.)

2659
01:31:27,434 --> 01:31:28,464
Ahn Dong Il.

2660
01:31:29,364 --> 01:31:30,934
"Do you know how many grains of rice?"

2661
01:31:31,464 --> 01:31:33,004
"It's 282."

2662
01:31:33,234 --> 01:31:35,533
- "It's 282?" - "It's 282."

2663
01:31:35,534 --> 01:31:36,903
Wrong.

2664
01:31:36,904 --> 01:31:38,343
- Sung Dong Il.
- Sung Dong Il.

2665
01:31:38,344 --> 01:31:40,744
"Do you know how many grains of rice? It's 281."

2666
01:31:41,374 --> 01:31:42,613
Just tell us how many.

2667
01:31:42,614 --> 01:31:45,014
- It's too many.
- For 280,

2668
01:31:45,144 --> 01:31:46,443
it's when it's a small piece.

2669
01:31:46,444 --> 01:31:47,853
- When it's a meal, - "Do you know..."

2670
01:31:47,854 --> 01:31:49,683
- it should be over 300.
- Sung Dong Il.

2671
01:31:49,684 --> 01:31:51,284
"Do you know how many grains of rice?"

2672
01:31:51,824 --> 01:31:53,123
"It's 320."

2673
01:31:53,124 --> 01:31:54,794
Correct!

2674
01:31:54,924 --> 01:31:56,193
- How did you know?
- How did you know?

2675
01:31:56,194 --> 01:31:57,493
How did you know?

2676
01:31:57,494 --> 01:31:58,494
Do you count the rice?

2677
01:31:58,495 --> 01:32:01,533
If it's for a meal, it's 320,

2678
01:32:01,534 --> 01:32:04,463
and if it's with drinks, it's 270.

2679
01:32:04,464 --> 01:32:06,704
(Gosh)

2680
01:32:06,974 --> 01:32:08,834
(Answer explanation)

2681
01:32:09,674 --> 01:32:12,803
A trained sushi chef typically uses about 320 grains of rice...

2682
01:32:12,804 --> 01:32:15,144
for one piece of sushi.

2683
01:32:15,614 --> 01:32:18,384
For lunch, 320 grains may be fine,

2684
01:32:19,144 --> 01:32:22,154
but on days like today or when people are drinking,

2685
01:32:23,414 --> 01:32:25,023
use only 280.

2686
01:32:25,024 --> 01:32:26,794
(Explanation complete)

2687
01:32:27,054 --> 01:32:28,653
That's cool.

2688
01:32:28,654 --> 01:32:30,424
(He had the same answer as Chairman Jin.)

2689
01:32:30,824 --> 01:32:31,824
Dad, you're so cool.

2690
01:32:31,825 --> 01:32:34,193
- That was cool.
- "There are 320 grains of rice."

2691
01:32:34,194 --> 01:32:36,094
I've never even seen the drama.

2692
01:32:36,434 --> 01:32:37,434
You don't know it?

2693
01:32:37,435 --> 01:32:39,203
- I don't.
- You're cool.

2694
01:32:39,204 --> 01:32:41,204
I only know the grains of rice for sushi.

2695
01:32:41,234 --> 01:32:42,503
- I didn't know.
- I didn't know.

2696
01:32:42,504 --> 01:32:44,803
- He's a father, for sure.
- That's cool.

2697
01:32:44,804 --> 01:32:46,204
(Sung Dong Il, 3: Ahn Dong Il, 2)

2698
01:32:46,444 --> 01:32:47,743
You need to get the tone...

2699
01:32:47,744 --> 01:32:49,074
- right for this.
- Tone?

2700
01:32:49,274 --> 01:32:50,414
I don't remember anything.

2701
01:32:50,684 --> 01:32:51,714
Here it is.

2702
01:32:53,754 --> 01:32:55,814
- I don't know.
- What is that?

2703
01:32:56,184 --> 01:32:58,384
(Hye Ri is sensing it.)

2704
01:32:58,454 --> 01:32:59,923
- Ahn Dong Il.
- What is it?

2705
01:32:59,924 --> 01:33:01,754
- Ahn Dong Il.
- Ahn Dong Il was first.

2706
01:33:01,954 --> 01:33:03,393
Hye Ri just stood up,

2707
01:33:03,394 --> 01:33:04,563
and didn't call out the name.

2708
01:33:04,564 --> 01:33:06,004
- Go ahead.
- Ahn Dong Il was first.

2709
01:33:06,864 --> 01:33:09,364
"Am I that pretty?"

2710
01:33:10,064 --> 01:33:11,304
- Wrong! That's not it.
- What?

2711
01:33:12,464 --> 01:33:13,873
It's similar.

2712
01:33:13,874 --> 01:33:15,103
- It's similar.
- It's our turn.

2713
01:33:15,104 --> 01:33:17,003
- Sung Dong Il.
- But it's much longer than that.

2714
01:33:17,004 --> 01:33:18,373
"I don't want to be cute."

2715
01:33:18,374 --> 01:33:20,943
- "I was just born cute." - Yes, that's it.

2716
01:33:20,944 --> 01:33:22,543
It's not "cute."

2717
01:33:22,544 --> 01:33:23,713
But that is the tone. Wrong!

2718
01:33:23,714 --> 01:33:24,884
"Pretty?"

2719
01:33:25,514 --> 01:33:27,383
- Do it again.
- If anyone knows,

2720
01:33:27,384 --> 01:33:29,213
it's open for anyone from now on.

2721
01:33:29,214 --> 01:33:30,253
Sung Dong Il!

2722
01:33:30,254 --> 01:33:32,084
- Sung Dong Il first.
- Go ahead.

2723
01:33:33,024 --> 01:33:36,093
"I was just born pretty."

2724
01:33:36,094 --> 01:33:37,623
That's it. That's the answer.

2725
01:33:37,624 --> 01:33:38,824
- Correct!
- Correct.

2726
01:33:39,324 --> 01:33:41,094
(Sung Dong Il, 4: Ahn Dong Il, 2)

2727
01:33:41,664 --> 01:33:44,063
What's the full line?

01:33:44,064 --> 01:33:48,334
"Ae Ra..."

2729
01:33:48,474 --> 01:33:50,743
"is not trying to be pretty, but just born pretty."

2730
01:33:50,744 --> 01:33:52,003
Oh, "Not trying to be pretty?"

2731
01:33:52,004 --> 01:33:53,374
(Model answer)

2732
01:33:53,644 --> 01:33:55,844
Gosh, how do you know the full version?

2733
01:33:56,014 --> 01:33:57,313
- We just need one more, right?
- Yes.

2734
01:33:57,314 --> 01:33:59,543
- It's the end.
- It will be it for them.

2735
01:33:59,544 --> 01:34:01,753
Please shout it out if you know the answer, Seol.

2736
01:34:01,754 --> 01:34:02,754
Let's go.

2737
01:34:02,755 --> 01:34:03,783
(Round 3, 7th famous scene)

2738
01:34:03,784 --> 01:34:04,784
Here it is.

2739
01:34:06,424 --> 01:34:08,224
- I don't know.
- Sung Dong Il.

2740
01:34:08,294 --> 01:34:09,294
Sung Dong Il.

2741
01:34:09,295 --> 01:34:10,864
"Do I like you?"

2742
01:34:11,294 --> 01:34:12,463
Correct!

2743
01:34:12,464 --> 01:34:14,234
(Team Sung Dong Il won Round 3!)

2744
01:34:14,464 --> 01:34:16,634
Seol got it?

2745
01:34:17,164 --> 01:34:20,903
The game is over, with 5 against 3.

2746
01:34:20,904 --> 01:34:23,033
- Amazing. What is that?
- Gosh.

2747
01:34:23,034 --> 01:34:25,004
Which show is that?

2748
01:34:25,504 --> 01:34:26,773
How did you know?

2749
01:34:26,774 --> 01:34:28,343
I saw it through a short video clip.

2750
01:34:28,344 --> 01:34:29,673
She was so good.

2751
01:34:29,674 --> 01:34:30,913
She saw it through a short video clip.

2752
01:34:30,914 --> 01:34:32,434
She saw it through a short video clip.

2753
01:34:32,944 --> 01:34:34,714
Fair enough. I fully admit it.

2754
01:34:34,914 --> 01:34:36,013
That was cool.

2755
01:34:36,014 --> 01:34:38,853
Good job, everyone.

2756
01:34:38,854 --> 01:34:40,423
We're very precise about these things.

Take it with Seol.

2762
01:34:48,334 --> 01:34:49,533
He took it alone.

2763
01:34:49,534 --> 01:34:51,374
(The brother and sister take a reunion photo.)

2764
01:34:53,804 --> 01:34:55,833
- She's so big now.
- I know.

2765
01:34:55,834 --> 01:34:57,773
- She's so tall, too.
- She still has the face, though.

2766
01:34:57,774 --> 01:34:59,173
- Yes, she's the same.
- Of course.

2767
01:34:59,174 --> 01:35:00,774
Of course, it stays.

2768
01:35:01,074 --> 01:35:03,043
Are you attending a school for the gifted, then?

2769
01:35:03,044 --> 01:35:04,313
- For middle school?
- It's not a school.

2770
01:35:04,314 --> 01:35:06,584
It's more like an academy.

2771
01:35:07,054 --> 01:35:08,283

I don't paint.

She never did.

01:35:26,704 --> 01:35:27,933
Eating.

2782
01:35:27,934 --> 01:35:29,274
- You remember eating?
- Yes.

2783
01:35:29,674 --> 01:35:32,343
I also remember sleeping in the living room.

2784
01:35:32,344 --> 01:35:34,474
I remember that. You were so sleepy.

2785
01:35:34,644 --> 01:35:36,573
And sometimes when you were sleeping,

2786
01:35:36,574 --> 01:35:39,344
we would just go ahead with the shoot.

2787
01:35:39,614 --> 01:35:41,913
You were really asleep. It was the scene when...

2788
01:35:41,914 --> 01:35:43,684
I think it was...

2789
01:35:43,954 --> 01:35:46,123
Was it the scene where I fell asleep after drinking banana milk?

2790
01:35:46,124 --> 01:35:47,224
Yes.

2791
01:35:48,254 --> 01:35:53,064
(In consideration of Seol, who had fallen asleep...)

2792
01:35:54,434 --> 01:35:58,134
(They captured her sleeping like an angel.)

2793
01:35:58,704 --> 01:36:00,374
I also remember that.

2794
01:36:00,504 --> 01:36:03,073
The time when I fell and cried.

2795
01:36:03,074 --> 01:36:05,174
- You remember that?
- Yes.

2796
01:36:06,674 --> 01:36:08,744
(While Sun Young was looking away, )

2797
01:36:09,514 --> 01:36:12,744
(Jin Ju fell from the stairs...)

2798
01:36:12,984 --> 01:36:15,383
I was supposed to cry since I fell from the stairs,

2799
01:36:15,384 --> 01:36:18,384
so I remember everyone trying to make me cry.

2800
01:36:18,824 --> 01:36:20,753
- Did we?
- Even the directors...

2801
01:36:20,754 --> 01:36:23,893
tried to make me cry with goblin calls.

2802
01:36:23,894 --> 01:36:26,264
That's right. I think we did that.

2803
01:36:27,064 --> 01:36:30,634
(Seol was able to cry with the goblin call.)

2804
01:36:30,804 --> 01:36:32,964
Goodness, what happened?

2805
01:36:33,164 --> 01:36:36,904
(Director Won Ho says, "I was sorry, Seol.")

2806
01:36:37,844 --> 01:36:39,774
(Sun Young remembers another scene.)

2807
01:36:39,974 --> 01:36:42,313
The scene where I got mad at my mother-in-law.

2808
01:36:42,314 --> 01:36:43,343
Yes.

2809
01:36:43,344 --> 01:36:45,643
By instinct, since I had to yell,

2810
01:36:45,644 --> 01:36:47,313
I covered your ears like this.

2811
01:36:47,314 --> 01:36:49,184
In case my voice gets too loud.

2812
01:36:50,684 --> 01:36:51,954
So, Mother,

2813
01:36:52,754 --> 01:36:54,053
please!

2814
01:36:54,054 --> 01:36:55,593
(Worried that her loud voice might scare Seol...)

2815
01:36:55,594 --> 01:36:57,694
Please stop coming to see us!

2816
01:36:58,164 --> 01:37:00,534
So that the three of us can live in peace.

2817
01:37:00,694 --> 01:37:03,834
(Sun Young instinctively covered Seol's ears.)

2818
01:37:05,864 --> 01:37:09,774
(There was a thin boundary between acting and reality.)

2819
01:37:09,934 --> 01:37:11,474
You don't remember, do you?

2820
01:37:11,544 --> 01:37:13,303
I remember carrying...

2821
01:37:13,304 --> 01:37:15,574
- the briquettes.
- Right.

2822
01:37:16,944 --> 01:37:18,514
- Right.
- Do you remember me?

2823
01:37:18,584 --> 01:37:20,114
- Yes.
- Do you remember me?

2824
01:37:20,214 --> 01:37:22,414
- We were like soulmates.
- That's right.

2825
01:37:23,154 --> 01:37:24,984
I'm Dong Ryong.

2826
01:37:25,184 --> 01:37:26,923
- Come in and take a seat.
- Okay.

2827
01:37:26,924 --> 01:37:28,293
Tell Kyung Pyo and others to take a seat.

2828
01:37:28,294 --> 01:37:29,670
(Reminisce about the past after eating.)

2829
01:37:29,694 --> 01:37:31,294
It's pretty nice.

2830
01:37:31,394 --> 01:37:32,493
- There's more sesame oil.
- Shall I add...

2831
01:37:32,494 --> 01:37:34,534
- more to the food?
- Yes.

2832
01:37:34,834 --> 01:37:36,394
- This is it.
- I'll try it.

2833
01:37:37,304 --> 01:37:38,504
You're mixing it again.

2834
01:37:40,674 --> 01:37:42,304
It looks so tasty.

2835
01:37:42,334 --> 01:37:44,204
- Seriously.
- Give the youngest one...

2836
01:37:44,344 --> 01:37:45,874
some hamburg steak.

2837
01:37:46,474 --> 01:37:47,573
Give the youngest one...

2838
01:37:47,574 --> 01:37:49,074
some hamburg steak.

2839
01:37:49,274 --> 01:37:51,314
- Yes. There are only two.
- What do you like?

2840
01:37:51,684 --> 01:37:53,143
- I eat everything with gusto.
- Really?

2841
01:37:53,144 --> 01:37:54,514
What are you doing here?

2842
01:37:54,684 --> 01:37:56,114
(Approaching)

2843
01:37:56,914 --> 01:37:58,283
- I eat everything with gusto.
- Really?

2844
01:37:58,284 --> 01:37:59,453
What are you doing here?

2845
01:37:59,454 --> 01:38:00,494
I like home-cooked food.

2846
01:38:00,594 --> 01:38:04,064
(Jae Myung gets caught in his attempt to steal some food.)

2847
01:38:04,694 --> 01:38:06,324
I thought you'd fall for it.

2848
01:38:07,864 --> 01:38:10,034
(Team Sung Dong Il has a feast.)

2849
01:38:11,134 --> 01:38:15,174
(Team Ahn Dong Il has food items that don't go together.)

2850
01:38:16,074 --> 01:38:18,274
It's my first time eating cockles and chicken together.

2851
01:38:18,844 --> 01:38:22,713
(A unique combination of savory food items)

2852
01:38:22,714 --> 01:38:24,520
- Are you eating fried chicken only?
- Fried chicken.

2853
01:38:24,544 --> 01:38:26,214
- Is there no rice?
- There's no rice.

2854
01:38:27,414 --> 01:38:28,654
Our meal is healthy.

2855
01:38:28,714 --> 01:38:30,114
Isn't it okay to eat rice?

2856
01:38:30,214 --> 01:38:31,354
Rice is complimentary.

2857
01:38:31,424 --> 01:38:32,683
Shall we eat?

2858
01:38:32,684 --> 01:38:33,753
- Yes.
- Let's eat.

2859
01:38:33,754 --> 01:38:35,100
- Enjoy the food.
- It looks tasty.

2860
01:38:35,124 --> 01:38:37,164
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

2861
01:38:37,264 --> 01:38:38,394
My goodness.

2862
01:38:39,624 --> 01:38:41,224
- Hey, spaghetti is tasty.
- It's tasty.

2863
01:38:41,294 --> 01:38:42,434
- It's tasty.
- Yes.

2864
01:38:42,964 --> 01:38:44,004
It's good.

2865
01:38:44,364 --> 01:38:46,033
- Would you like some soup?
- Eat chicken.

2866
01:38:46,034 --> 01:38:47,374
It's the best.

2867
01:38:49,234 --> 01:38:51,744
- Bibimbap is so tasty.
- Three stars.

2868
01:38:52,274 --> 01:38:53,704
Who made it?

2869
01:38:54,114 --> 01:38:56,073
Who made it?

2870
01:38:56,074 --> 01:38:58,114
Would you give me some bibimbap?

2871
01:38:58,684 --> 01:38:59,814
Bibimbap?

2872
01:39:00,444 --> 01:39:01,553
I want some.

2873
01:39:01,554 --> 01:39:03,714
(He gives some bibimbap to his daughter right away.)

2874
01:39:05,084 --> 01:39:06,384
Thank you.

2875
01:39:08,224 --> 01:39:10,223
(Eating)

2876
01:39:10,224 --> 01:39:12,194
Seol, eat a lot.

2877
01:39:12,694 --> 01:39:14,374
- Eat a lot.
- Are you done? May I eat it?

2878
01:39:15,094 --> 01:39:16,863
They have cockles, but no rice!

2879
01:39:16,864 --> 01:39:18,184
(They have cockles, but no rice!)

2880
01:39:18,234 --> 01:39:20,033
Fried chicken and cockles make...

2881
01:39:20,034 --> 01:39:21,333
a fantastic combination.

2882
01:39:21,334 --> 01:39:22,334
Chicken and cockles.

2883
01:39:22,634 --> 01:39:25,544
(Jealous)

2884
01:39:26,044 --> 01:39:27,674
Does anyone want cockles?

2885
01:39:27,974 --> 01:39:29,243
- Me.
- Shall we exchange it...

2886
01:39:29,244 --> 01:39:30,473
- with spaghetti?
- Cockles?

2887
01:39:30,474 --> 01:39:32,783
Ten cockles for a plate of spaghetti.

2888
01:39:32,784 --> 01:39:33,883
- Okay.
- Oh, yes.

2889
01:39:33,884 --> 01:39:35,414
Twenty cockles.

2890
01:39:35,684 --> 01:39:36,753
Fifteen cockles.

2891
01:39:36,754 --> 01:39:38,154
Forget it then.

2892
01:39:38,184 --> 01:39:39,223
Forget it then.

2893
01:39:39,224 --> 01:39:40,853
Fine. Forget it then.

2894
01:39:40,854 --> 01:39:41,994
He called it off.

2895
01:39:42,054 --> 01:39:43,354
I wasn't going to eat.

2896
01:39:45,194 --> 01:39:46,694
- Hey.
- A shoulder wrestling.

2897
01:39:46,794 --> 01:39:47,833
A shoulder wrestling.

2898
01:39:47,834 --> 01:39:50,354
(She sets out to steal food after the agreement falls through.)

2899
01:39:50,604 --> 01:39:53,333
(Eating)

2900
01:39:53,334 --> 01:39:54,503
Hey.

2901
01:39:54,504 --> 01:39:56,774
The motive of the drama is...

2902
01:39:57,004 --> 01:39:58,744
the neighborly love.

2903
01:39:59,574 --> 01:40:00,743
Give me a plate.

2904
01:40:00,744 --> 01:40:01,873
- Jae Myung.
- Give me a plate.

2905
01:40:01,874 --> 01:40:03,014
You only gave me a bit.

2906
01:40:03,344 --> 01:40:04,344
Give it to me.

2907
01:40:04,584 --> 01:40:05,843
Give us the cockles.

2908
01:40:05,844 --> 01:40:06,913
(The families share food as if it was 1988.)

2909
01:40:06,914 --> 01:40:09,083
- Cockles.
- Here's spaghetti.

2910
01:40:09,084 --> 01:40:10,213
- Oh, yes.
- Yes.

2911
01:40:10,214 --> 01:40:11,754
(Happy)

2912
01:40:12,424 --> 01:40:13,723
Gosh, those beggars.

2913
01:40:13,724 --> 01:40:14,854
(Gosh, those beggars)

2914
01:40:15,424 --> 01:40:16,693
Eat some cockles.

2915
01:40:16,694 --> 01:40:17,964
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2916
01:40:21,494 --> 01:40:23,734
(He eats seasoned cockles, his favorite dish.)

2917
01:40:24,434 --> 01:40:28,804
(They inhale spaghetti they desperately wanted.)

2918
01:40:29,334 --> 01:40:30,533
It's so tasty.

2919
01:40:30,534 --> 01:40:31,804
(It's so tasty.)

2920
01:40:32,274 --> 01:40:34,914
"If you're going to be like that, gather around and eat."

2921
01:40:35,714 --> 01:40:36,814
It was a good line.

2922
01:40:37,984 --> 01:40:39,313
She gave me this.

2923
01:40:39,314 --> 01:40:40,444
It looks tasty.

2924
01:40:41,314 --> 01:40:42,354
Hold on.

2925
01:40:44,084 --> 01:40:50,154
(Food was shared between neighbors back then.)

2926
01:40:50,664 --> 01:40:51,923
(The Reply 1988 families still share dishes.)

2927
01:40:51,924 --> 01:40:53,093
What did you eat?

2928
01:40:53,094 --> 01:40:54,693
- A drumstick.
- A drumstick?

2929
01:40:54,694 --> 01:40:56,593
The quality is insane.

2930
01:40:56,594 --> 01:40:57,733
A drumstick.

2931
01:40:57,734 --> 01:40:59,134
Hey, eat a drumstick.

2932
01:41:00,234 --> 01:41:02,174
- She ate a drumstick.
- Don't pressure her.

2933
01:41:02,274 --> 01:41:03,334
Is there no makgeolli?

2934
01:41:04,344 --> 01:41:06,144
(Crunchy)

2935
01:41:09,714 --> 01:41:11,144
Eat chicken.

2936
01:41:12,344 --> 01:41:14,684
I'm suddenly reminded of that time.

2937
01:41:14,954 --> 01:41:17,354
It wasn't like that when we met by ourselves.

2938
01:41:17,524 --> 01:41:18,624
But...

2939
01:41:19,484 --> 01:41:20,854
when she walked in,

2940
01:41:21,624 --> 01:41:24,223
six to eight months of that time...

2941
01:41:24,224 --> 01:41:26,094
came back to me.

2942
01:41:26,624 --> 01:41:28,294
I bet it was the same for Kyung Pyo.

2943
01:41:29,234 --> 01:41:31,204
Why did you tear up?

2944
01:41:31,934 --> 01:41:32,963
What?

2945
01:41:32,964 --> 01:41:34,904
When I saw Seol? I felt so strange.

2946
01:41:35,404 --> 01:41:36,503
I told you earlier.

2947
01:41:36,504 --> 01:41:37,573
I carried her all the time.

2948
01:41:37,574 --> 01:41:39,874
- It was like a family reunion.
- It's understandable.

2949
01:41:40,074 --> 01:41:42,243
- You didn't know what to do.
- No.

2950
01:41:42,244 --> 01:41:43,314
I felt so strange.

2951
01:41:44,844 --> 01:41:47,213
I found it fascinating too.

2952
01:41:47,214 --> 01:41:49,554
I'm not the type to cry a lot.

2953
01:41:50,784 --> 01:41:52,983
I felt emotions...

2954
01:41:52,984 --> 01:41:55,094
I couldn't describe with words.

2955
01:41:55,524 --> 01:41:57,993
It wasn't sadness or happiness,

2956
01:41:57,994 --> 01:42:00,064
but tears rolled down my face.

2957
01:42:01,194 --> 01:42:02,793
I think I'm happy...

2958
01:42:02,794 --> 01:42:04,404
because she has grown up so well.

2959
01:42:05,264 --> 01:42:07,674
When Seol walked toward us,

2960
01:42:09,004 --> 01:42:10,174
I realized...

2961
01:42:10,634 --> 01:42:13,544
how much years had passed for the first time.

2962
01:42:13,674 --> 01:42:16,444
I felt like time was walking toward us.

2963
01:42:17,784 --> 01:42:19,614
Seeing a girl...

2964
01:42:19,984 --> 01:42:23,054
who has grown so much in the past ten years...

2965
01:42:23,454 --> 01:42:25,053
made me realize it.

2966
01:42:25,054 --> 01:42:26,654
So it was...

2967
01:42:26,724 --> 01:42:28,424
both touching...

2968
01:42:28,524 --> 01:42:31,464
and emotional.

2969
01:42:32,464 --> 01:42:33,493
Seol, how was it...

2970
01:42:33,494 --> 01:42:35,134
to see us after so many years?

2971
01:42:35,364 --> 01:42:36,663
You know,

2972
01:42:36,664 --> 01:42:38,333
I hadn't realized it before.

2973
01:42:38,334 --> 01:42:39,663
But meeting everyone again...

2974
01:42:39,664 --> 01:42:41,404
made me feel like...

2975
01:42:41,504 --> 01:42:44,574
I had gone back to being a five-year-old.

2976
01:42:44,844 --> 01:42:46,003
Really?

2977
01:42:46,004 --> 01:42:48,674
I could feel love for the family.

2978
01:42:50,214 --> 01:42:52,044
We felt the same emotions.

2979
01:42:52,884 --> 01:42:54,384
You also became absorbed in emotions.

2980
01:42:54,454 --> 01:42:55,784
You were the same.

2981
01:42:57,354 --> 01:43:00,524
It's very fascinating. The sentimentality of 1988...

2982
01:43:00,584 --> 01:43:03,153
when there was neighborly love...

2983
01:43:03,154 --> 01:43:04,894
isn't something we possess.

2984
01:43:06,064 --> 01:43:07,563
But it's magical...

2985
01:43:07,564 --> 01:43:10,193
how we ended up having that sentimentality.

2986
01:43:10,194 --> 01:43:12,504
The actors get pulled into that era.

2987
01:43:12,964 --> 01:43:15,704
It's like the magic...

2988
01:43:15,804 --> 01:43:17,573
of Reply 1988.

2989
01:43:17,574 --> 01:43:19,454
(Everyone felt the magical love in Reply 1988.)

2990
01:43:19,974 --> 01:43:21,713
Why do I feel like I had more children?

2991
01:43:21,714 --> 01:43:22,843
(Laughing)

2992
01:43:22,844 --> 01:43:25,414
I feel like I had more children.

2993
01:43:25,844 --> 01:43:27,653
I feel like...

2994
01:43:27,654 --> 01:43:31,424
all the children in the neighborhood were my own.

2995
01:43:31,624 --> 01:43:33,623
For the first time in a while,

2996
01:43:33,624 --> 01:43:35,354
I was surrounded by people.

2997
01:43:35,894 --> 01:43:37,764
It was very nice.

2998
01:43:38,224 --> 01:43:39,323
You know,

2999
01:43:39,324 --> 01:43:40,963
there's something I hear a lot.

3000
01:43:40,964 --> 01:43:42,193
"How are you these days?"

3001
01:43:42,194 --> 01:43:43,933
"When I go to a drama set with thoughts of Reply 1988,"

3002
01:43:43,934 --> 01:43:45,833
"it's scary and difficult..."

3003
01:43:45,834 --> 01:43:47,804
"because it's so hard."

3004
01:43:48,334 --> 01:43:50,203
My first-ever set...

3005
01:43:50,204 --> 01:43:53,644
had the familial atmosphere.

3006
01:43:53,974 --> 01:43:55,844
That was how I learned things.

3007
01:43:56,314 --> 01:43:59,284
Even now, when I go to a new set,

3008
01:43:59,444 --> 01:44:01,053
I wonder why...

3009
01:44:01,054 --> 01:44:04,584
I give the staff members and actors so much affection.

3010
01:44:04,984 --> 01:44:08,793
- I think this drama started it.
- That's right.

3011
01:44:08,794 --> 01:44:11,893
The filming experience was very warm and nice.

3012
01:44:11,894 --> 01:44:14,493
When I film a new drama,

3013
01:44:14,494 --> 01:44:17,764
I keep trying to befriend people and give them affection.

3014
01:44:18,104 --> 01:44:19,833
It became a habit of mine.

3015
01:44:19,834 --> 01:44:21,734
- Everyone is like that.
- Yes.

3016
01:44:24,034 --> 01:44:26,473
When I filmed the drama,

3017
01:44:26,474 --> 01:44:29,073
I was 1 or 2 years older...

3018
01:44:29,074 --> 01:44:30,414
than Dong Hwi currently is.

3019
01:44:30,884 --> 01:44:32,084
I was ambitious,

3020
01:44:32,344 --> 01:44:34,814
passionate, and competitive.

3021
01:44:35,054 --> 01:44:36,254
He shouldn't try too hard.

3022
01:44:37,684 --> 01:44:39,324
He shouldn't struggle too much.

3023
01:44:39,424 --> 01:44:41,924
If he's struggling or feeling pain, he should let it happen.

3024
01:44:42,494 --> 01:44:44,193
If he spends the next ten years like that,

3025
01:44:44,194 --> 01:44:46,164
he'll become an actor who is better, cooler,

3026
01:44:46,564 --> 01:44:49,334
and more relaxed.

3027
01:44:49,594 --> 01:44:51,163
I want him to be comfortable.

3028
01:44:51,164 --> 01:44:52,403
(He doesn't want Dong Hwi to experience the same pain.)

3029
01:44:52,404 --> 01:44:55,204
I have that thought often these days.

3030
01:44:55,674 --> 01:44:57,074
So... What's wrong?

3031
01:44:57,804 --> 01:45:00,144
I want to tell Dong Hwi that.

3032
01:45:00,574 --> 01:45:01,644
What's wrong?

3033
01:45:05,544 --> 01:45:06,784
To be honest,

3034
01:45:07,614 --> 01:45:10,753
my desire to be an actor like Jae Myung...

3035
01:45:10,754 --> 01:45:15,724
became even stronger in the past ten years.

3036
01:45:16,054 --> 01:45:19,994
So I want him to struggle for about 30 more years.

3037
01:45:20,494 --> 01:45:22,093
If he wants, it can be 40 to 50 years.

3038
01:45:22,094 --> 01:45:23,693
People live up to the age of 100 these days.

3039
01:45:23,694 --> 01:45:25,033
My child is seven,

3040
01:45:25,034 --> 01:45:26,334
so I need to work diligently.

3041
01:45:29,674 --> 01:45:31,273
It has totally been ten years.

3042
01:45:31,274 --> 01:45:33,003
Let's eat the Reply cake as a dessert.

3043
01:45:33,004 --> 01:45:34,104
Okay.

3044
01:45:34,814 --> 01:45:36,214
Let's slice it...

3045
01:45:36,444 --> 01:45:38,043
so that staff members can eat.

3046
01:45:38,044 --> 01:45:40,584
(Let us tell you about this cake.)

3047
01:45:40,714 --> 01:45:43,913
We prepared a cake to celebrate the tenth anniversary.

3048
01:45:43,914 --> 01:45:45,183
(The production crew prepared a cake to celebrate the 10th anniversary.)

3049
01:45:45,184 --> 01:45:46,223
This is incredible.

3050
01:45:46,224 --> 01:45:47,464
- Thank you.
- It really has...

3051
01:45:47,824 --> 01:45:50,393
- the retro vibe.
- Dong Il will say a few words...

3052
01:45:50,394 --> 01:45:52,124
and blow out the candle.

3053
01:45:53,094 --> 01:45:54,863
It has already been ten years. When we filmed it,

3054
01:45:54,864 --> 01:45:56,163
it was ridiculously hard.

3055
01:45:56,164 --> 01:45:57,864
We pulled so many all-nighters.

3056
01:45:58,464 --> 01:46:01,904
We met up in a healthy state for the tenth anniversary.

3057
01:46:02,134 --> 01:46:03,404
I hope...

3058
01:46:03,874 --> 01:46:06,174
we'll meet again for the 20th anniversary.

3059
01:46:06,804 --> 01:46:08,243
So that everyone will stay healthy,

3060
01:46:08,244 --> 01:46:09,473
blow out the candle.

3061
01:46:09,474 --> 01:46:10,644
That's right, Seol.

3062
01:46:10,984 --> 01:46:13,244
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

3063
01:46:14,084 --> 01:46:15,984
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

3064
01:46:17,754 --> 01:46:18,823
(Congratulations on the 10th anniversary of Reply 1988.)

3065
01:46:18,824 --> 01:46:19,883
Thank you for your hard work.

3066
01:46:19,884 --> 01:46:21,723
- Thank you for your hard work.
- Thank you for your hard work.

3067
01:46:21,724 --> 01:46:23,593
(Congratulations on the 10th anniversary of Reply 1988.)

3068
01:46:23,594 --> 01:46:25,223
We want to know...

3069
01:46:25,224 --> 01:46:27,933
what Reply 1988 means to you.

3070
01:46:27,934 --> 01:46:30,664
(What is Reply 1988 to you?)

3071
01:46:31,164 --> 01:46:35,534
It's very hard to wrap it up with one sentence.

3072
01:46:41,774 --> 01:46:43,414
It's a big blessing...

3073
01:46:44,114 --> 01:46:47,113
that suddenly entered my life...

3074
01:46:47,114 --> 01:46:50,014
when I least expected it.

3075
01:46:50,354 --> 01:46:51,753
It's an endless honor.

3076
01:46:51,754 --> 01:46:54,283
"Will I be able to participate in another drama like this?"

3077
01:46:54,284 --> 01:46:55,724
I can't help but have that thought.

3078
01:46:56,124 --> 01:46:59,664
It helped me make a living as an actor,

3079
01:46:59,694 --> 01:47:01,964
so I'm thankful for it.

3080
01:47:02,294 --> 01:47:06,334
When I look back on my childhood,

3081
01:47:06,834 --> 01:47:08,234
that era comes to mind.

3082
01:47:08,434 --> 01:47:12,204
I continued to act after this drama.

3083
01:47:13,044 --> 01:47:15,673
I wanted to keep doing well,

3084
01:47:15,674 --> 01:47:17,443
but there were hardships.

3085
01:47:17,444 --> 01:47:20,284
This drama gave me strength every time that happened.

3086
01:47:27,894 --> 01:47:29,193
- It sounds like...
- Yes.

3087
01:47:29,194 --> 01:47:30,924
We share the same thoughts.

3088
01:47:31,094 --> 01:47:35,164
Without even realizing it, I experienced, learned,

3089
01:47:35,334 --> 01:47:38,003
and felt a lot...

3090
01:47:38,004 --> 01:47:41,274
thanks to Reply 1988.

3091
01:47:48,144 --> 01:47:50,474
You're crying again. I knew it.

3092
01:48:02,094 --> 01:48:03,194
I'm thankful...

3093
01:48:04,924 --> 01:48:07,564
that Reply 1988 is a part of my filmography.

3094
01:48:10,794 --> 01:48:11,834
Why are you crying?

3095
01:48:13,404 --> 01:48:15,204
It looks like we'll have...

3096
01:48:15,404 --> 01:48:17,774
the most amount of screen time thanks to you.

3097
01:48:17,944 --> 01:48:19,043
No.

3098
01:48:19,044 --> 01:48:20,644
- You cry so easily.
- Yes.

3099
01:48:22,474 --> 01:48:23,943
(And)

3100
01:48:23,944 --> 01:48:25,920
- Give me your number.
- Thank you for your hard work.

3101
01:48:25,944 --> 01:48:27,343
- Thank you for your hard work.
- Dad.

3102
01:48:27,344 --> 01:48:30,013
Let's take a group photo while Won Ho is here.

3103
01:48:30,014 --> 01:48:31,724
- Okay.
- That sounds good.

3104
01:48:32,854 --> 01:48:34,223
Please huddle closer for the photo.

3105
01:48:34,224 --> 01:48:35,354
The last photo.

3106
01:48:36,124 --> 01:48:37,863
The tenth anniversary.

3107
01:48:37,864 --> 01:48:39,764
Two, three.

3108
01:48:41,464 --> 01:48:44,834
(They take the last group photo of the 10th anniversary.)

3109
01:48:45,134 --> 01:48:48,473
- All done.
- Thank you for your hard work.

3110
01:48:48,474 --> 01:48:51,644
(It's time to part ways.)

3111
01:48:53,674 --> 01:48:55,874
(However, )

3112
01:48:57,014 --> 01:48:58,743
(it's hard for the families to leave.)

3113
01:48:58,744 --> 01:49:00,504
- Thank you for your hard work.
- Take care.

3114
01:49:00,544 --> 01:49:01,654
Hey.

3115
01:49:03,084 --> 01:49:04,183
Let's survive and meet again.

3116
01:49:04,184 --> 01:49:07,054
You never know when you'll die. Let's have a hug.

3117
01:49:07,954 --> 01:49:09,394
See you later.

3118
01:49:09,494 --> 01:49:10,753
- All right.
- Okay.

3119
01:49:10,754 --> 01:49:12,624
- All right.
- Take it.

3120
01:49:12,724 --> 01:49:14,634
Are you crying again?

3121
01:49:15,094 --> 01:49:16,893
- She's crying again.
- Come on.

3122
01:49:16,894 --> 01:49:18,580
- I guess she won't see us again.
- She held back tears.

3123
01:49:18,604 --> 01:49:19,933
Will you go to the afterparty?

3124
01:49:19,934 --> 01:49:21,334
(Deok Sun bursts into tears again.)

3125
01:49:21,434 --> 01:49:24,173
- Thank you for your hard work.
- Thank you for your hard work.

3126
01:49:24,174 --> 01:49:25,873
- Thank you.
- Look at the way...

3127
01:49:25,874 --> 01:49:27,990
- they're crying again.
- Don't leave anything behind.

3128
01:49:28,014 --> 01:49:29,743
- What's wrong with them?
- What's wrong with them?

3129
01:49:29,744 --> 01:49:32,444
They're facing each other and crying.

3130
01:49:32,714 --> 01:49:34,754
- All right.
- What's wrong with them?

3131
01:49:36,284 --> 01:49:37,353
Thank you.

3132
01:49:37,354 --> 01:49:40,854
This won't do. Let's have them get married.

3133
01:49:40,984 --> 01:49:42,393
Let's have them get married.

3134
01:49:42,394 --> 01:49:44,124
They're ridiculous.

3135
01:49:44,764 --> 01:49:46,123
Why are you guys crying?

3136
01:49:46,124 --> 01:49:48,033
It's for the trailer.

3137
01:49:48,034 --> 01:49:50,194
- Let's go.
- Thank you for your hard work.

3138
01:49:50,294 --> 01:49:51,563
- Thank you for your hard work.
- Bye.

3139
01:49:51,564 --> 01:49:53,084
(It's time to go their separate ways.)

3140
01:49:53,434 --> 01:49:54,633
- I'll get going now.
- Okay.

3141
01:49:54,634 --> 01:49:55,934
- Bye.
- Let's go.

3142
01:49:57,534 --> 01:49:59,174
Thank you.

3143
01:49:59,374 --> 01:50:01,573
- Thank you for your hard work.
- Okay.

3144
01:50:01,574 --> 01:50:02,973
- Let's meet up often.
- Okay.

3145
01:50:02,974 --> 01:50:04,043
Bye.

3146
01:50:04,044 --> 01:50:05,113
(Ssangmun-dong left us 10 years ago.)

3147
01:50:05,114 --> 01:50:06,683
- Bye.
- Bye.

3148
01:50:06,684 --> 01:50:08,313
- Bye.
- Thank you.

3149
01:50:08,314 --> 01:50:11,584
(It waves goodbye to us again after 10 years.)

3150
01:50:13,884 --> 01:50:17,094
(A video message to the viewers who have stayed behind)

3151
01:50:19,394 --> 01:50:20,664
I'll go first.

3152
01:50:21,194 --> 01:50:22,464
- You go last.
- Okay.

3153
01:50:24,034 --> 01:50:26,934
I just want to thank you.

3154
01:50:27,564 --> 01:50:29,473
I hope you'll continue to watch Reply 1988...

3155
01:50:29,474 --> 01:50:32,374
and feel the familial love.

3156
01:50:32,604 --> 01:50:35,844
I hope it remains as something that moistens your heart...

3157
01:50:36,544 --> 01:50:38,813
when you think about it.

3158
01:50:38,814 --> 01:50:40,190
(May it be remembered as a drama that gives warmth.)

3159
01:50:40,214 --> 01:50:43,654
If you continue to remember us,

3160
01:50:44,114 --> 01:50:46,954
we'll welcome the 20th and 30th anniversaries...

3161
01:50:47,484 --> 01:50:49,924
together and... Shall I say that we'll grow old together?

3162
01:50:50,024 --> 01:50:52,924
I hope we'll be together for a long time.

3163
01:50:53,024 --> 01:50:54,664
I hope everyone will stay healthy.

3164
01:50:54,864 --> 01:50:56,533
You've worked hard in the past ten years.

3165
01:50:56,534 --> 01:50:59,304
See you again after ten years.

3166
01:50:59,364 --> 01:51:00,404
Thank you.

3167
01:51:01,874 --> 01:51:03,604
As for Reply 1988...

3168
01:51:04,104 --> 01:51:06,544
During the past ten years and even now,

3169
01:51:07,144 --> 01:51:08,773
I can feel the love.

3170
01:51:08,774 --> 01:51:12,284
It goes without saying. I'm very grateful.

3171
01:51:12,714 --> 01:51:14,913
It was thanks to the love...

3172
01:51:14,914 --> 01:51:16,913
that I gained the courage...

3173
01:51:16,914 --> 01:51:18,953
to make a new drama...

3174
01:51:18,954 --> 01:51:20,754
and attempt new things.

3175
01:51:21,424 --> 01:51:23,923
It's thanks to the viewers...

3176
01:51:23,924 --> 01:51:26,293
that we're living.

3177
01:51:26,294 --> 01:51:30,393
Seriously, I'm eternally grateful.

3178
01:51:30,394 --> 01:51:31,464
Thank you.

3179
01:51:31,834 --> 01:51:34,463
Thank you for loving us to this day.

3180
01:51:34,464 --> 01:51:37,634
Thank you for the love and support you'll send us in the future.

3181
01:51:38,504 --> 01:51:40,044
I hope you'll be happy.

3182
01:51:40,944 --> 01:51:43,174
- Thank you for your love.
- Thank you.

3183
01:51:43,644 --> 01:51:47,384
When I shared how I felt after filming Reply 1988,

3184
01:51:48,054 --> 01:51:49,853
I said, "I hope..."

3185
01:51:49,854 --> 01:51:52,553
"it becomes a drama that stays in your memories..."

3186
01:51:52,554 --> 01:51:54,454
"for a long time."

3187
01:51:55,524 --> 01:51:58,023
My wish came true,

3188
01:51:58,024 --> 01:52:00,923
so I sincerely want to thank...

3189
01:52:00,924 --> 01:52:02,734
the viewers.

3190
01:52:03,394 --> 01:52:04,934
Thank you so much.

3191
01:52:09,034 --> 01:52:10,774
The era we miss with all our hearts...

3192
01:52:11,404 --> 01:52:13,603
because it was hot and pure.

3193
01:52:13,604 --> 01:52:15,043
(The narration of the last episode of Reply 1988)

3194
01:52:15,044 --> 01:52:16,314
Do you hear me?

3195
01:52:16,744 --> 01:52:18,384
Reply if you do.

3196
01:52:19,314 --> 01:52:20,844
My 1988,

3197
01:52:21,754 --> 01:52:23,314
my youthful days.

3198
01:52:29,024 --> 01:52:36,534
(Congratulations on the 10th anniversary of Reply 1988.)
