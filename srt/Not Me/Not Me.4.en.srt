2
00:00:18,306 --> 00:00:22,457
UNAR is well-known but he’s anonymous.

3
00:00:22,638 --> 00:00:25,973
Nobody knows who he truly is.

4
00:00:27,896 --> 00:00:28,995
Don’t follow me

5
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:30,057
if you want no regrets.

6
00:00:30,919 --> 00:00:33,657
You’ve been worse after the fire, Black.

7
00:00:34,226 --> 00:00:36,226
I just feel like Black has changed.

8
00:00:36,226 --> 00:00:37,346
It isn’t like him at all.

9
00:00:37,781 --> 00:00:39,200
Stay with me at the garage.

10
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,096
I will train you to be as good as you once were.

11
00:01:21,441 --> 00:01:23,441
No.

12
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,280
It’s not true.

13
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,040
Sean.

14
00:01:29,143 --> 00:01:30,631
Help me.

15
00:01:36,822 --> 00:01:38,822
Sean.

16
00:01:40,766 --> 00:01:42,766
Sean.

17
00:01:45,083 --> 00:01:47,083
Sean.

18
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:48,730
Help me.

19
00:03:53,313 --> 00:03:55,313
Why are you huddling me?

20
00:03:55,313 --> 00:03:57,275
I’m not. You are.

21
00:03:57,275 --> 00:03:58,645
It’s like you’re having a fever last night.

22
00:03:58,978 --> 00:04:01,859
I checked up on you. Then you pulled my hand close and hugged me tightly.

23
00:04:01,859 --> 00:04:03,590
That’s how I ended up like this.

24
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,444
Did I really do that?

25
00:04:13,201 --> 00:04:15,201
It’s tear gas. Watch out!

26
00:04:43,129 --> 00:04:45,129
Open up!

27
00:04:45,684 --> 00:04:47,684
Move.

28
00:05:04,742 --> 00:05:06,742
Take it.

29
00:05:07,814 --> 00:05:09,056
Don’t rub your eyes.

30
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,323
You two took so long to realize it and get out.

31
00:05:14,467 --> 00:05:16,070
What the heck are you playing?

32
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:19,170
I’m not playing. I’m coaching you.

33
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:20,728
Coaching what? We almost died.

34
00:05:20,728 --> 00:05:24,014
If you could put out the gas quickly, you wouldn’t end up like this.

35
00:05:25,251 --> 00:05:26,841
That’s your way of coaching?

36
00:05:26,841 --> 00:05:28,174
We were sleeping.

37
00:05:32,575 --> 00:05:34,575
In the real situation,

38
00:05:34,575 --> 00:05:36,291
you will get shot if you act like a sitting duck.

39
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:38,461
They don’t care what’s right or wrong.

40
00:05:38,827 --> 00:05:40,823
You must always be wide awake.

41
00:05:40,823 --> 00:05:42,439
Be ready for what’s to come.

42
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:43,689
What could we have done?

43
00:05:43,689 --> 00:05:45,017
That’s a bedroom.

44
00:05:45,017 --> 00:05:46,552
We must flee as soon as possible.

45
00:05:46,552 --> 00:05:49,826
Black, there are blankets and water in your room.

46
00:05:49,826 --> 00:05:52,084
You have things to use to put out the gas.

47
00:05:52,084 --> 00:05:54,573
Remember to extinguish it as soon as possible.

48
00:05:54,573 --> 00:05:56,435
Who could even concentrate in that situation?

49
00:05:59,648 --> 00:06:01,648
Always have a presence of mind, Sean.

50
00:06:31,195 --> 00:06:33,195
You’ve changed so much.

51
00:06:33,697 --> 00:06:35,697
Why?

52
00:06:35,697 --> 00:06:37,221
You’ve never been this kind.

53
00:06:38,654 --> 00:06:42,354
Do you remember the first day we went out for a mission?

54
00:06:42,864 --> 00:06:47,363
(I just never thought dilemma could come from such a small thing like this.)

55
00:06:47,613 --> 00:06:49,733
Why do you look like you don’t remember?

56
00:06:51,281 --> 00:06:53,281
You can’t remember, can you?

57
00:06:53,744 --> 00:06:54,843
Why?

58
00:06:54,843 --> 00:06:57,600
Did you bring that up just to reopen my memory?

59
00:06:58,305 --> 00:07:00,305
No, I don’t want to.

60
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:03,457
But what you just did today was odd.

61
00:07:04,239 --> 00:07:05,915
What did I do?

62
00:07:05,915 --> 00:07:07,214
You helped me.

63
00:07:08,527 --> 00:07:12,084
You never cared about me or helped me before.

64
00:07:13,074 --> 00:07:15,074
You were an asshole, you know that?

65
00:07:20,111 --> 00:07:24,057
You’re the one that formed our group after we ousted the chancellor.

66
00:07:24,057 --> 00:07:27,891
You couldn’t tolerate him because he deprived the students’ right to share their views.

67
00:07:37,981 --> 00:07:39,981
You do that end.

68
00:07:39,981 --> 00:07:40,825
Quickly.

69
00:07:40,825 --> 00:07:42,169
I know.

70
00:07:42,536 --> 00:07:44,691
Come on. Someone is here.

71
00:07:44,691 --> 00:07:45,887
Sean, faster.

72
00:07:45,887 --> 00:07:46,995
Let’s go.

73
00:07:48,443 --> 00:07:50,443
What are you guys doing? Stop!

74
00:07:50,443 --> 00:07:51,398
Stop!

75
00:07:51,398 --> 00:07:52,172
Freeze!

76
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:55,159
Let go of me!

77
00:07:57,966 --> 00:07:59,065
Black!

78
00:08:20,387 --> 00:08:22,674
You got me suspended, remember?

79
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:28,499
You also said if we got caught, we must admit what we did.

80
00:08:29,003 --> 00:08:32,131
If we didn’t want to go down, try to survive the situation.

81
00:08:32,606 --> 00:08:35,307
You remember every word I said?

82
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:36,553
You forgot your own words.

83
00:08:36,553 --> 00:08:38,110
What a scumbag!

84
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:39,192
I am a scumbag.

85
00:08:39,192 --> 00:08:40,290
So?

86
00:08:48,913 --> 00:08:52,368
I helped you because I knew Gumpa was testing us.

87
00:08:52,511 --> 00:08:53,328
Yeah?

88
00:08:54,004 --> 00:08:56,640
If I didn’t help, he would yell at me.

89
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,246
So you’re afraid of him yelling now?

90
00:08:59,907 --> 00:09:01,907
No. I’m just annoyed.

91
00:09:04,239 --> 00:09:05,337
Is that so?

92
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:06,247
Yes.

93
00:09:06,844 --> 00:09:09,689
If that was real, I would just let you die.

94
00:09:10,403 --> 00:09:12,403
Don’t hold me back next time.

95
00:09:24,724 --> 00:09:26,724
Don’t you want to know who hurt Black?

96
00:09:26,724 --> 00:09:29,523
Think about it. A girlfriend must be someone close to him.

97
00:09:29,523 --> 00:09:31,551
And someone close should know everything.

98
00:09:31,551 --> 00:09:32,799
Call her.

99
00:09:33,495 --> 00:09:35,845
Is she Black’s girlfriend?

100
00:09:35,845 --> 00:09:37,845


101
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:25,572
‘I’m sharing my old paintings for now.’

102
00:10:25,572 --> 00:10:29,168
‘I might stop going out there to paint for a while since I’m being watched.’

103
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:49,030
Why did he paint me?

104
00:11:15,701 --> 00:11:17,701
He must have lost his mind.

105
00:11:24,697 --> 00:11:25,852
Who is this?

106
00:11:25,975 --> 00:11:29,869
‘Don’t share it anywhere. I’m afraid you might be in danger.’

107
00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:38,309
(Hello. My name is Black.)

108
00:11:38,309 --> 00:11:41,002
(Let’s see what I’m gonna do today.)

109
00:11:41,002 --> 00:11:42,303
(Don’t.)

110
00:11:42,303 --> 00:11:43,597
Just a little.

111
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:46,625
Black, I don’t have a video of you.

112
00:11:46,877 --> 00:11:49,045
Can’t I keep some?

113
00:11:49,045 --> 00:11:50,462
Let me record a video.

114
00:11:50,881 --> 00:11:51,529
(No.)

115
00:11:51,529 --> 00:11:52,572
Why not?

116
00:11:53,758 --> 00:11:55,572
(Are you done with the dance practice?)

117
00:11:55,572 --> 00:11:57,083
I am.

118
00:11:58,172 --> 00:11:59,678
So tired.

119
00:11:59,678 --> 00:12:01,155
(Show me the dance.)

120
00:12:01,155 --> 00:12:02,818
What will I get if I do?

121
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:07,450
What will I get?

122
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:09,279
Is she Black’s girlfriend?

123
00:12:09,532 --> 00:12:11,793
Are they keeping their relationship a secret?

124
00:12:19,725 --> 00:12:24,417
(Why did you send me a picture of Eugene?)

125
00:12:28,233 --> 00:12:32,579
(Where do they normally do the dance rehearsal?)

126
00:12:33,164 --> 00:12:35,164
(But you two broke up, didn’t you?)

127
00:12:36,564 --> 00:12:42,861
(I just have something to talk to her about.)

128
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,889
(Try the faculty.)

129
00:12:46,889 --> 00:12:48,589

00:12:58,806 --> 00:13:01,212

Wow! She’s good.

154
00:14:13,656 --> 00:14:15,656
Excuse me one second.

155
00:14:16,249 --> 00:14:18,654
Black.

156
00:14:19,194 --> 00:14:21,009
Black!

157
00:14:39,551 --> 00:14:41,551
Mr. White is here, sir.

158
00:14:49,381 --> 00:14:50,862
This is your room?

159
00:14:50,862 --> 00:14:52,462
How much is the rent?

160
00:14:52,462 --> 00:14:53,705
I’m not renting it.

161
00:14:53,705 --> 00:14:54,579
It’s my building.

162
00:14:54,579 --> 00:14:55,586
Your building?

163
00:14:56,422 --> 00:14:58,192
Is it over 10 billion?

164
00:14:58,192 --> 00:14:59,553
No idea.

165
00:14:59,553 --> 00:15:01,327
I got it after my dad died.

166
00:15:01,327 --> 00:15:02,492
Follow me.

167
00:15:04,854 --> 00:15:06,854
What is your father’s business?

168
00:15:06,854 --> 00:15:10,361
Import, export, produce, retail,

169
00:15:10,361 --> 00:15:11,863
whatever there is, I do it all.

170
00:15:11,863 --> 00:15:13,096
You’re imperial.

171
00:15:13,096 --> 00:15:15,661
I should start calling you President Todd now.

172
00:15:15,661 --> 00:15:16,508
Nope!

173
00:15:16,508 --> 00:15:18,779
Call me Mr. President Todd.

174
00:15:27,006 --> 00:15:30,759
So why did you sound anxious over the phone?

175
00:15:33,768 --> 00:15:35,768
I found a girl.

176
00:15:39,967 --> 00:15:41,967
Is she Black’s girlfriend?

177
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:46,799
I am not very sure.

178
00:15:53,689 --> 00:15:55,689
I just met her.

179
00:15:55,689 --> 00:15:57,073
You met her already?

180
00:15:57,567 --> 00:15:59,567
I didn’t talk to her though.

181
00:15:59,567 --> 00:16:00,908
She saw me and I ran away.

182
00:16:00,908 --> 00:16:03,348
You ran away from her? What a chicken!

183
00:16:03,348 --> 00:16:06,083
I’m not Black. Why would I want to see her?

184
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,673
All the more reason to see her.

185
00:16:07,673 --> 00:16:09,160
Don’t you want to know who hurt Black?

186
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,919
Think about it. A girlfriend must be someone close to him.

187
00:16:12,919 --> 00:16:14,750
And someone close should know everything.

188
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,271
Call her.

189
00:16:16,271 --> 00:16:17,568
No.

190
00:16:17,568 --> 00:16:18,105
I don’t want to get caught.

191
00:16:18,105 --> 00:16:19,268
Caught?

192
00:16:19,268 --> 00:16:21,112
You two are like two peas in a pod.

193
00:16:21,112 --> 00:16:22,828
She can never tell. Trust me.

194
00:16:22,828 --> 00:16:24,076
What did you say her name was again?

195
00:16:24,076 --> 00:16:25,281
Eugene.

196
00:16:25,572 --> 00:16:26,784
Eugene.

197
00:16:27,051 --> 00:16:28,311
Eugene.

198
00:16:28,757 --> 00:16:30,457
Are you calling her?

199
00:16:30,827 --> 00:16:32,827
Eugene.

200
00:16:42,716 --> 00:16:43,802
She didn’t pick up.

201
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:44,877
She might not be available.

202
00:16:44,877 --> 00:16:47,320
If she calls back, ask her to meet up.

203
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,367
Meet up?

204
00:16:48,367 --> 00:16:49,675
Yes, at your place.

205
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:50,760
My place?

206
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,616
If you take her out to eat and talk, you might get caught.

207
00:16:54,616 --> 00:16:57,292
But if you two meet at your place, you can just stay quiet.

208
00:16:57,292 --> 00:16:58,483
It won’t be weird.

209
00:16:58,483 --> 00:17:00,205
Do you think it’s a good idea?

210
00:17:02,142 --> 00:17:04,142
Are you afraid?

211
00:17:04,142 --> 00:17:07,276
You’re afraid something sexy might happen.

212
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:08,521
Are you nuts?

213
00:17:08,521 --> 00:17:10,112
I won’t do anything to my brother’s girlfriend.

214
00:17:12,062 --> 00:17:14,062
You guys are twins.

215
00:17:14,062 --> 00:17:15,367
You are exactly alike.

216
00:17:16,231 --> 00:17:17,429
Or maybe you don’t have it?

217
00:17:17,429 --> 00:17:18,498
I do.

218
00:17:18,498 --> 00:17:21,042
I just don’t want to make her look bad.

219
00:17:21,042 --> 00:17:23,120
Stop joking around. What should I do?

220
00:17:27,952 --> 00:17:31,829
If I were you, I’d definitely meet her.

221
00:17:32,826 --> 00:17:34,826
She might know something about Black.

222
00:17:36,884 --> 00:17:40,366
And I’m sure you can get out of any troubling situation.

223
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:58,160
(Please call me back. I’m waiting.)

224
00:18:14,685 --> 00:18:17,376
You’ve been very punctual these days.

225
00:18:17,376 --> 00:18:19,197
You are 15 minutes early.

226
00:18:21,628 --> 00:18:23,628
Honey.

227
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,060
Are you keeping up with the news on the fire?

228
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,800
Not really. I’ve been busy.

229
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,879
What’s up?

230
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,852
It’s becoming quiet.

231
00:18:36,852 --> 00:18:38,538
Tawi isn’t even charged with anything.

232
00:18:38,538 --> 00:18:40,505
We did everything we could.

233
00:18:40,505 --> 00:18:42,183
If the media won’t be our mouthpiece,

234
00:18:42,183 --> 00:18:43,861
and the officers don’t dig into it,

235
00:18:43,861 --> 00:18:45,878
things will always end up the same way.

236
00:18:45,878 --> 00:18:47,154
It’s always been like this.

237
00:18:47,154 --> 00:18:48,949
How can we just stand and watch, right?

238
00:18:56,704 --> 00:18:58,704
Sean.

239
00:18:59,424 --> 00:19:00,992
Why is he here?

240
00:19:00,992 --> 00:19:03,904
It’s a special lecture class for both faculties.

241
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,613
What’s the problem between you two?

242
00:19:07,255 --> 00:19:08,921
Tired of seeing his face.

243
00:19:17,137 --> 00:19:23,681
We’re honored to welcome one of the most anticipated guests.

244
00:19:23,681 --> 00:19:28,425
He is a specialist in Thai history and has a significant number of academic work.

245
00:19:28,425 --> 00:19:32,703
Please welcome Dr. Charus Kanchananiran.

246
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:41,429
I’m just going to leave this class to you.

247
00:19:41,429 --> 00:19:42,916
Thank you very much.

248
00:19:44,567 --> 00:19:49,530
Thanks to Professor Supoj and every one of you for having me.

249
00:19:49,530 --> 00:20:00,012
Today, I've been requested to go in-depth on the exemption from punishment, or, in a nutshell, Impunity.

250
00:20:00,892 --> 00:20:06,492
Impunity is a legal privilege to conduct wrong acts without being penalized.

251
00:20:08,724 --> 00:20:13,440
It’s the privilege that absolutely breaches rule of law principles.

252
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,310
It’s has become an identity of the Thai legal system.

253
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:23,873
This privilege is exercised both indirectly and publicly.

254
00:20:23,873 --> 00:20:27,326
Indirect uses of this type of power include using connections

255
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:33,109
or powerful people asking or ordering someone to do something for them secretly.

256
00:20:33,109 --> 00:20:38,721
And to use the privilege publicly is to make any legal case disappear.

257
00:20:42,172 --> 00:20:46,691
When we have conflicts with the rich, the powerful, or bureaucrats,

258
00:20:46,691 --> 00:20:49,657
these guys are always clear of charges.

259
00:20:49,657 --> 00:20:51,456
Yes, sir. You’re right.

260
00:20:51,978 --> 00:20:53,234
Just pay attention.

261
00:20:53,234 --> 00:20:59,218
(Thai political histories are mentioned as examples in this lecture class.)

262
00:20:59,218 --> 00:21:01,736
(Some of these I learned and heard from my father.)

263
00:21:02,137 --> 00:21:08,192
(I've been told to learn it and keep it within when discussing these topics.)

264
00:21:08,412 --> 00:21:11,896
And how great is the impact of impunity?

265
00:21:12,686 --> 00:21:24,098
We can understand it by taking back old legal cases and reopening them with the rightful justice system,

266
00:21:24,746 --> 00:21:31,009
Impunity for those powerful people will be very unlikely to happen.

267
00:21:31,531 --> 00:21:38,414
Because we now have a standard that says no one is above the law in this country.

268
00:21:38,414 --> 00:21:42,375
Everybody is equal under the law.

269
00:21:46,593 --> 00:21:54,421
It's unfortunate that the reality of our history is the complete opposite.

270
00:21:56,058 --> 00:22:06,330
Students, now that you’ve listened to all of it, can you name one impunity case for me, please?

271
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:11,610
Please.

272
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:15,329
The extrajudicial execution of a truck driver of Tawi’s company in 2018.

273
00:22:15,329 --> 00:22:19,487
Tawi was free of the drug trafficking charge since he claimed he wasn’t involved with the man.

274
00:22:19,487 --> 00:22:22,740
The police didn’t even investigate further or question witnesses.

275
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:27,094
The blame was all on the scapegoat who was extrajudicially killed.

276
00:22:27,517 --> 00:22:29,323
Thank you very much.

277
00:22:29,767 --> 00:22:36,299
If you follow political news, you may know who Tawi is

278
00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:38,675
and the powerful people he’s connected with.

279
00:22:38,675 --> 00:22:41,692
And you will get the concept of impunity.

280
00:22:42,966 --> 00:22:46,056
(That was only the first example brought up in a classroom.)

281
00:22:46,056 --> 00:22:49,921
(A small case that I and many others had never heard about.)

282
00:22:50,258 --> 00:22:57,071
(I'm curious why a reserved person like him chose to be the first to speak.)

283
00:22:57,902 --> 00:23:02,221
Thank you so much. Is there any other case you all would like to mention?

284
00:23:02,221 --> 00:23:04,056
What’s that case?

285
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,950
It was a long time ago.

286
00:23:08,422 --> 00:23:10,422
Then why did he bring it up?

287
00:23:11,993 --> 00:23:13,993
Sean hates Tawi’s guts.

288
00:23:13,993 --> 00:23:17,156
Anything about Tawi is worth mentioning.

289
00:23:25,847 --> 00:23:27,230
Guys.

290
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:29,324
For the next mission,

291
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:31,668
we will let the crocodile decide.

292
00:23:32,687 --> 00:23:34,687
You first, Black.

293
00:23:34,687 --> 00:23:36,687


294
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:58,319
He sounded very sensible.

295
00:23:58,913 --> 00:24:00,123
Gram.

296
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,900
When did Sean leave the class?

297
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,280
I need to talk to him.

298
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,673
You guys didn’t even look at each other’s faces when the class began.

299
00:24:07,673 --> 00:24:09,351
And now you’re asking for him.

300
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:14,115
You can talk to him when we meet him later.

301
00:24:14,115 --> 00:24:16,886
By the way, Sean’s example was so on point.

302
00:24:16,886 --> 00:24:19,497
Tawi bribed his way out before the case even gets to court.

303
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,465
Hey, how do you know he bribed?

304
00:24:22,465 --> 00:24:24,685
The information on this case is very weak.

305
00:24:24,685 --> 00:24:26,382
It isn’t even on the way to court yet.

306
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:28,215
It’s pretty obvious.

307
00:24:28,215 --> 00:24:31,859
One man couldn’t manage to run that huge amount of drugs.

308
00:24:32,254 --> 00:24:35,262
If Tawi wasn’t rich, he would be in jail by now.

309
00:24:35,262 --> 00:24:37,987
We quarrel every single day.

310
00:24:37,987 --> 00:24:42,317
Well, well. I’m just a trans ex-girlfriend you forgot about.

311
00:24:42,757 --> 00:24:45,676
I know you’re courting someone in Fine and Applied Arts.

312
00:24:46,086 --> 00:24:48,058
What are you even talking about?

313
00:24:48,058 --> 00:24:49,943
I’m always with Black.

314
00:24:49,943 --> 00:24:51,008
Right?

315
00:24:51,542 --> 00:24:53,692
Come on. I’ll take you home.

316
00:24:54,141 --> 00:24:55,117
Bye.

317
00:24:55,117 --> 00:24:56,389
See you later.

318
00:24:58,723 --> 00:25:00,723
Let’s go. I have something else to do.

319
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:10,530
[Eugene]

320
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:11,872
Don’t you want to know who hurt Black?

321
00:25:11,872 --> 00:25:15,033
Think about it. A girlfriend must be someone close to him.

322
00:25:15,033 --> 00:25:16,835
And someone close should know everything.

323
00:25:16,835 --> 00:25:18,391
Call her.

324
00:25:25,084 --> 00:25:25,952
Sean.

325
00:25:25,952 --> 00:25:27,911
Sean, hold on.

326
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:31,181
Can I ride with you to the garage?

327
00:25:31,181 --> 00:25:32,530
Where is your bike?

328
00:25:33,375 --> 00:25:34,967
Gumpa took it back for repair.

329
00:25:34,967 --> 00:25:37,497
He chew me out saying I wasn’t careful with his bike.

330
00:25:37,595 --> 00:25:39,684
You’ve been riding a lot to where?

331
00:25:41,191 --> 00:25:43,191
To get inspiration.

332
00:25:43,191 --> 00:25:44,322
Hop on.

333
00:25:47,569 --> 00:25:48,754
Sean.

334
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:52,790
Can I ask you something?

335
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:55,330
Has Namo ever painted or drawn for you?

336
00:25:55,562 --> 00:25:56,898
No.

337
00:25:56,898 --> 00:25:58,744
You two are in a relationship but you never got a drawing from her?

338
00:25:58,744 --> 00:26:00,584
I never asked her to be my girlfriend.

339
00:26:00,584 --> 00:26:01,988
So you guys are just talking?

340
00:26:01,988 --> 00:26:03,621
Why so many questions?

341
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,325
Hop on.

342
00:26:05,325 --> 00:26:06,594
Stop talking nonsense.

343
00:26:20,436 --> 00:26:22,436
It won’t catch fire if you light it like that.

344
00:26:22,436 --> 00:26:24,059
When will we get to eat?

345
00:26:24,847 --> 00:26:25,810
Give it here. I’ll do it.

346
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:27,206
I can do it.

347
00:26:27,206 --> 00:26:29,017
I said give it here.

348
00:26:44,871 --> 00:26:45,837
Here.

349
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:48,689
Add them in.

350
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:58,072
Why are you staring at me?

351
00:26:58,392 --> 00:27:00,392
You’ve been staring since the lecture class.

352
00:27:00,591 --> 00:27:04,732
I just wondered why you mentioned that case.

353
00:27:05,038 --> 00:27:06,511
How is that related to you?

354
00:27:06,948 --> 00:27:11,132
Everything about Tawi is always related to me.

355
00:27:13,579 --> 00:27:15,579
I think it’s more to the story.

356
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:22,338
It’s burning me. Can’t you see?

357
00:27:22,338 --> 00:27:23,218
I can.

358
00:27:23,849 --> 00:27:28,140
Now you know how it’s like to play with fire.

359
00:27:31,333 --> 00:27:33,333
To Black’s plan.

360
00:27:34,898 --> 00:27:36,898
Cheers!

361
00:27:42,382 --> 00:27:44,382
For the next mission,

362
00:27:44,382 --> 00:27:46,809
is there any issue in our society you’d like to address?

363
00:27:48,386 --> 00:27:49,722
Me.

364
00:27:49,722 --> 00:27:51,808
I want to reform the justice system.

365
00:27:51,808 --> 00:27:54,752
I’m a law student but it doesn’t apply in real life.

366
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:56,864
I want to rebuild it from scratch.

367
00:27:57,465 --> 00:27:59,465
How are you going to do that?

368
00:28:01,302 --> 00:28:02,326
I don’t know.

369
00:28:02,326 --> 00:28:03,629
Why did you even start it?

370
00:28:03,629 --> 00:28:05,708
I will tell you later when I figure it out.

371
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,993
If you really want to do it,

372
00:28:10,671 --> 00:28:12,671
let this crocodile decide.

373
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:17,210
And you, Yok?

374
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:19,350
I want to address disability rights.

375
00:28:20,004 --> 00:28:23,565
I don’t want them to be more privileged than other people.

376
00:28:23,565 --> 00:28:25,552
I want them to have equal rights to us.

377
00:28:25,552 --> 00:28:28,465
They should have work opportunities, access to public transport,

378
00:28:28,465 --> 00:28:31,243
and easy stuff like being treated like normal people.

379
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,510
Your mom must have been through so much.

380
00:28:37,423 --> 00:28:39,423
And you, Sean?

381
00:28:42,265 --> 00:28:44,753
I want to destroy every business Tawi is running.

382
00:28:47,242 --> 00:28:49,242
Damn! That’s personal.

383
00:28:49,242 --> 00:28:50,737
But it’s not.

384
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:56,265
His business runs on his connections with the powerful lads who abuse people.

385
00:28:56,265 --> 00:28:57,797
If we can bring him down,

386
00:28:57,797 --> 00:28:59,596
it won’t be just me who benefits from it.

387
00:29:03,689 --> 00:29:05,689
And you, Black?

388
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:12,610
I’m not telling.

389
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:13,861
Try to act cool?

390
00:29:14,173 --> 00:29:15,917
I wish you don’t get a chance to speak at all.

391
00:29:16,117 --> 00:29:18,163
Let’s do as I said.

392
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:20,563
We will let the crocodile decide.

393
00:29:24,415 --> 00:29:26,415
Start with you, Black.

394
00:29:36,797 --> 00:29:38,797
Why are you doing nothing?

395
00:29:38,797 --> 00:29:40,049
Press a tooth.

396
00:29:40,444 --> 00:29:41,962
Did you forget?

397
00:29:54,858 --> 00:29:56,858
My turn.

398
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:43,570
Hey!

399
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:45,212
That tooth is reserved.

400
00:30:45,212 --> 00:30:46,397
Go for some other ones.

401
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:48,230
And why must I do that?

402
00:30:54,988 --> 00:30:55,797
Damn you!

403
00:30:55,797 --> 00:30:57,900
What the hell? You also got it last time.

404
00:30:58,725 --> 00:31:01,696
Will you tell me now what you want to do?

405
00:31:08,516 --> 00:31:10,516
Let’s do what Sean proposed.

406
00:31:11,228 --> 00:31:14,130
Let’s not follow my plan twice, or he might be fussy like a child.

407
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:15,526
Quit bullshitting!

408
00:31:15,526 --> 00:31:17,083
I pressed the tooth you wanted.

409
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:18,562
But you’re the one that pressed it.

410
00:31:19,106 --> 00:31:20,210
Will you take it or not?

411
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:21,818
If you won’t, give it to me, Black.

412
00:31:24,913 --> 00:31:26,523
You’re normally a control freak.

413
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:30,231
Why are you going easy on me? What do you want?

414
00:31:32,047 --> 00:31:36,622
I'm curious to see if you can attack Tawi harder than last time.

415
00:31:37,824 --> 00:31:38,926
Yeah?

416
00:31:39,321 --> 00:31:41,728
Someone like you will let me lead?

417
00:31:41,728 --> 00:31:44,441
Did I say I would let you lead?

418
00:31:44,441 --> 00:31:46,771
Then why did you give me the shot if you wouldn’t let me lead?

419
00:31:47,139 --> 00:31:48,391
You make a plan.

420
00:31:49,082 --> 00:31:52,466
Every time I make a plan, you always interrupt.

421
00:31:52,466 --> 00:31:53,885
What is the matter now?

422
00:31:53,885 --> 00:31:55,687
Why are you letting me do it easily?

423
00:31:57,112 --> 00:32:01,416
I want to see a super privileged man like Tawi get punished too.

424
00:32:02,034 --> 00:32:03,039
Fine.

425
00:32:03,293 --> 00:32:04,944
Just wait and see.

426
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:09,330
I will make a man with impunity like Tawi pay.

427
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,240
Are you not wearing the perfume I bought you?

428
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,206
I thought I’d put it on before I met you.

429
00:32:16,206 --> 00:32:17,649
But you came first.

430
00:32:17,649 --> 00:32:19,178
You, you, and you.

431
00:32:19,348 --> 00:32:21,177
Why aren’t you calling me like you used to?

432
00:32:21,177 --> 00:32:23,177


433
00:33:07,708 --> 00:33:09,708
Hi, Black.

434
00:33:11,959 --> 00:33:13,959
What’s wrong?

435
00:33:13,959 --> 00:33:16,170
You called me but you seem surprised.

436
00:33:18,442 --> 00:33:21,000
I just didn’t expect you would be in my room like that.

437
00:33:22,493 --> 00:33:24,750
Why not? I missed you.

438
00:33:34,123 --> 00:33:36,123
What’s the matter?

439
00:33:44,471 --> 00:33:46,471
What do you want from me?

440
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:50,151
I just wanted to see you.

441
00:33:55,708 --> 00:33:57,708
You’re so mean.

442
00:33:57,708 --> 00:34:01,282
You pushed me away with no explanation.

443
00:34:01,282 --> 00:34:03,282
And now you want to see me?

444
00:34:05,205 --> 00:34:07,205
You never let out what’s on your mind, Black.

445
00:34:07,548 --> 00:34:10,765
(Shit! Black’s girlfriend is sulking. What should I do?)

446
00:34:28,877 --> 00:34:30,877
Didn’t you miss me too?

447
00:34:31,877 --> 00:34:33,877
I did.

448
00:34:50,175 --> 00:34:53,385
I have something for you. Just wait here.

449
00:35:23,014 --> 00:35:25,014
Vodka?

450
00:35:25,468 --> 00:35:27,601
Why do you want to drink it?

451
00:35:27,601 --> 00:35:28,656
To cool it down.

452
00:35:28,656 --> 00:35:29,988
You’re crazy.

453
00:35:30,311 --> 00:35:32,031
It will make us even hotter.

454
00:35:38,294 --> 00:35:39,317
Who’s calling?

455
00:35:39,573 --> 00:35:41,333
You can take it.

456
00:35:43,397 --> 00:35:46,119
It’s fine. I want to be with you.

457
00:35:53,167 --> 00:35:54,479
It’s very strong.

458
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:56,866
Drink up. You won’t get drunk.

459
00:36:06,032 --> 00:36:08,032
Hold this.

460
00:36:22,592 --> 00:36:24,592
Here. Bottoms up.

461
00:36:32,708 --> 00:36:34,708
Are you not wearing the perfume I bought you?

462
00:36:37,812 --> 00:36:39,812
I went to class today.

463
00:36:40,018 --> 00:36:42,574
I thought I’d put it on before I met you.

464
00:36:42,574 --> 00:36:43,873
But you came first.

465
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:46,850
You, you, and you.

466
00:36:47,296 --> 00:36:49,463
Are you still mad at me?

467
00:36:49,788 --> 00:36:51,914
Why aren’t you calling me like you used to?

468
00:36:52,932 --> 00:36:56,772
(Damn it! What did Black call his girlfriend?)

469
00:36:56,772 --> 00:36:58,930
Fine. Call me whatever.

470
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:02,313
No one can make Black do anything he doesn’t want.

471
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:03,964
Right?

472
00:37:25,769 --> 00:37:27,769
I like it when you’re drunk.

473
00:37:28,752 --> 00:37:33,376
When you’re drunk, you become very gentle.

474
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:35,141
You’re sweet.

475
00:37:43,832 --> 00:37:48,438
I’m so sorry for being foul-mouthed to you.

476
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:54,774
I was so scared you wouldn’t want to see me again.

477
00:37:58,022 --> 00:38:01,069
Can we go back to what we used to be?

478
00:38:16,421 --> 00:38:18,421
Do you still love me, Black?

479
00:38:22,708 --> 00:38:26,268
Drink up and I’ll tell you.

480
00:38:41,011 --> 00:38:43,011
So?

481
00:38:43,813 --> 00:38:45,813
What are you telling me?

482
00:38:56,663 --> 00:38:58,663
I love you, Black.

483
00:39:34,268 --> 00:39:36,268
Black.

484
00:39:45,458 --> 00:39:47,458
[Are you meeting up with Black?]

485
00:39:47,458 --> 00:39:52,235
[I wanna talk to you. Meet me tomorrow at…]

486
00:39:58,846 --> 00:40:03,987
(Maybe Black was injured because of Eugene?)

487
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:15,693
Directed by Anucha Boonyawatana

488
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:19,877
I think Gram might be the one that hurt Black.

489
00:43:19,877 --> 00:43:21,263
Black is acting really weird.

490
00:43:21,263 --> 00:43:22,985
And you are too, Sean.

491
00:43:22,985 --> 00:43:23,948
How?

492
00:43:23,948 --> 00:43:25,878
You’ve been taking extra interest in him.

493
00:43:25,878 --> 00:43:27,117
Are you all ready?

494
00:43:27,117 --> 00:43:29,116
This is nothing like when we burned his house.

495
00:43:29,116 --> 00:43:31,380
His business unit is full of his employees.

496
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:34,111
So I asked Gumpa to train us exclusively.

497
00:43:35,041 --> 00:43:37,041
Prepare to jump.

498
00:43:39,266 --> 00:43:42,891
