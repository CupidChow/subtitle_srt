3
00:00:18,322 --> 00:00:20,972
This is Techit, Tawi’s right-hand man.

4
00:00:20,972 --> 00:00:21,739
We can’t underestimate him.

5
00:00:21,739 --> 00:00:23,886
We will sneak into his beverage manufacturer

6
00:00:23,886 --> 00:00:25,449
and add a substance to the product.

7
00:00:25,449 --> 00:00:29,537
Yok and Gram, do whatever you want to distract them.

8
00:00:29,537 --> 00:00:33,643
Black, get up there and pour all the bitterant into this tank.

9
00:00:34,723 --> 00:00:37,161
Black, what are you doing?

10
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:41,920
Sean!

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,395
Why didn’t you follow the plan?

12
00:00:43,395 --> 00:00:45,065
What the hell is wrong with you?

13
00:00:50,156 --> 00:00:53,890
My dad died because of the shit they do.

14
00:01:01,232 --> 00:01:02,900
Sean, stop!

15
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,020
He’s dying.

16
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,220
Sean!

17
00:01:05,424 --> 00:01:06,256
Black.

18
00:01:08,756 --> 00:01:09,877
Are you OK?

19
00:01:21,785 --> 00:01:23,198
So this is about your dad?

20
00:01:23,198 --> 00:01:25,063
Don’t f*cking ask!

21
00:01:27,103 --> 00:01:29,103
Listen.

22
00:01:29,103 --> 00:01:32,524
Your plan was to get people to boycott his product.

23
00:01:32,524 --> 00:01:36,177
But if we had really added that bitterant and customers drank it,

24
00:01:36,177 --> 00:01:38,259
they may have been seriously harmed.

25
00:01:38,259 --> 00:01:42,238
The more people affected, the more they will oppose what we're doing.

26
00:01:42,596 --> 00:01:46,232
Those who used to be on our side might change their minds.

27
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:53,920
I thought if we added the bitterant, it wouldn't pass the QC system in the first place.

28
00:01:54,178 --> 00:02:00,282
All we need is news that his security system is faulty, allowing outsiders to enter and disrupt operations.

29
00:02:00,282 --> 00:02:02,959
It’s enough to make people afraid to buy.

30
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:06,152
This way we don’t have to risk causing people trouble.

31
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,600
If you wanted to do that,

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,134
why didn’t you say anything when we went through the plan?

33
00:02:13,782 --> 00:02:17,220
The idea just popped in my head when I was about to pour the substance.

34
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,333
You’re so problematic.

35
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:19,336
That’s enough!

36
00:02:26,167 --> 00:02:28,167
Let go of me!

37
00:03:05,954 --> 00:03:07,954
Are you alright?

38
00:03:12,456 --> 00:03:14,456
Drink some water.

39
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,950
Can you get up?

40
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:21,687
Come on.

41
00:03:21,687 --> 00:03:23,244
Sure you’re okay?

42
00:03:27,388 --> 00:03:29,092
Do you know about Sean’s father?

43
00:03:29,092 --> 00:03:30,000
I don’t.

44
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,296
He never mentioned him.

45
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,950
Was I that wrong?

46
00:03:35,781 --> 00:03:37,781
Wrong or not, you already did it.

47
00:03:37,781 --> 00:03:39,055
What do you think?

48
00:03:40,834 --> 00:03:42,834
I don’t think your idea is gonna work.

49
00:03:43,793 --> 00:03:45,793
Why not?

50
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:48,535
It isn't strong enough to provoke people's rage

51
00:03:48,535 --> 00:03:50,420
because it doesn’t directly affect them.

52
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,957
When they aren’t poked, they don’t care.

53
00:03:52,957 --> 00:03:54,728
It’s always been like this.

54
00:03:54,728 --> 00:03:56,407
What should I do?

55
00:03:56,407 --> 00:03:59,394
I don’t want us to cause any more problems.

56
00:04:00,655 --> 00:04:02,655
Your thoughts have changed a lot.

57
00:04:02,655 --> 00:04:03,914
If I said this back then,

58
00:04:03,914 --> 00:04:05,976
you’d say I was too naive.

59
00:04:06,435 --> 00:04:07,840
Hold on tight.

60
00:05:18,677 --> 00:05:20,116
Hey.

61
00:05:21,844 --> 00:05:23,844
Are you okay?

62
00:05:26,303 --> 00:05:28,303
You should spend the night at my house.

63
00:05:29,354 --> 00:05:31,633
I don’t want you to go back and see Black.

64
00:05:31,633 --> 00:05:33,704
You almost strangled him to death.

65
00:05:33,704 --> 00:05:35,340
You shouldn’t meet him now.

66
00:05:35,511 --> 00:05:37,380
I won’t do anything to him.

67
00:05:37,683 --> 00:05:40,130
I also have something to discuss with you.

68
00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:43,742
About your dad.

69
00:05:44,694 --> 00:05:46,694
I don’t want to talk about that.

70
00:05:49,429 --> 00:05:52,169
Have a couple of beers with me then.

71
00:05:53,681 --> 00:05:55,000
Come on.

72
00:05:56,831 --> 00:05:58,831
Fine. I’ll crash here.

73
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:16,424
Yok.

74
00:06:17,652 --> 00:06:19,652
I think we’re done.

75
00:06:20,323 --> 00:06:22,323
Nothing went as planned.

76
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,315
When I saw that Black wasn’t doing what we planned,

77
00:06:25,315 --> 00:06:26,802
I was furious.

78
00:06:27,436 --> 00:06:29,436
I didn't even delete the footage.

79
00:06:29,436 --> 00:06:31,848
I did not demolish the computer server.

80
00:06:33,383 --> 00:06:35,383
I wasn’t being cautious enough.

81
00:06:37,249 --> 00:06:38,968
Come on.

82
00:06:38,968 --> 00:06:40,772
Let bygones be bygones. Get over it.

83
00:06:41,384 --> 00:06:44,481
I’ve thought about what we have done.

84
00:06:44,481 --> 00:06:47,135
We set fire to Tawi's house. We broke into his business unit.

85
00:06:47,135 --> 00:06:50,385
These two charges can get us many years in prison.

86
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:53,503
If you want to know how long exactly, ask Gram.

87
00:06:53,503 --> 00:06:55,520
I’m sure he knows the exact period.

88
00:06:55,928 --> 00:06:56,877
Asshole!

89
00:06:57,144 --> 00:06:59,863
Can’t you just cheer me up?

90
00:07:00,731 --> 00:07:02,577
I’ll cheer you up now.

91
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:04,108
Your plan sucked.

92
00:07:04,108 --> 00:07:06,018
It sucked so bad.

93
00:07:07,404 --> 00:07:10,781
What happens in the manufacturer stays in the manufacturer.

94
00:07:10,781 --> 00:07:12,639
They saw us in there.

95
00:07:13,282 --> 00:07:15,563
Of course, any substance in their product will be scrutinized.

96
00:07:15,563 --> 00:07:17,603
Did you even use your brain, dumbass?

97
00:07:18,123 --> 00:07:20,123
Thank you.

98
00:07:20,123 --> 00:07:22,222
That’s your way of cheering people up?

99
00:07:22,222 --> 00:07:23,947
Wait until I finish.

100
00:07:26,437 --> 00:07:29,738
No one knows what will happen after what we did.

101
00:07:29,738 --> 00:07:33,861
What Black did might work since it won’t affect other people.

102
00:07:33,861 --> 00:07:36,599
As a result, attacking his manufacturer may be only a symbolic movement.

103
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:39,160
Are you taking Black’s side now?

104
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,921
Be reasonable, Sean.

105
00:07:42,213 --> 00:07:48,955
Gram and I went along with your plan since we knew it’d be on the news.

106
00:07:48,955 --> 00:07:53,120
Tawi can't cover it up no matter how hard he tries.

107
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,935
And when it’s on the news, people can at least see that we’re against Tawi.

108
00:07:58,935 --> 00:08:01,426
It might trigger them to become more willing to fight.

109
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:04,295
Can it even happen?

110
00:08:04,295 --> 00:08:06,127
We can look on the bright side,

111
00:08:06,127 --> 00:08:09,268
when we burned Tawi’s house down, the press was silent,

112
00:08:09,268 --> 00:08:12,088
but there were some undercurrents against him on social media.

113
00:08:12,671 --> 00:08:18,339
An invasion of his manufacturer could show how evil Tawi is.

114
00:08:18,339 --> 00:08:21,293
And it may inspire people to be more courageous to fight against him.

115
00:08:27,067 --> 00:08:29,883
Get some rest. Put it out of your mind.

116
00:08:29,883 --> 00:08:32,794
Wake up in the evening and you can think again.

117
00:09:10,688 --> 00:09:12,688
Let’s go.

118
00:09:14,351 --> 00:09:16,351
Good morning.

119
00:09:16,351 --> 00:09:18,364
(Long time no see. How have you been?)

120
00:09:18,644 --> 00:09:20,281
She’s greeting you,

121
00:09:20,281 --> 00:09:22,281
asking how you are since she hasn’t seen you in a long time.

122
00:09:22,998 --> 00:09:24,621
I’m doing great.

123
00:09:24,894 --> 00:09:26,661
Why are you home early? Are you taking a day off?

124
00:09:28,207 --> 00:09:31,149
(The manufacturer is temporarily closed since some people set it on fire.)

125
00:09:32,133 --> 00:09:34,541
Are you working for that jerk Tawi?

126
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,718
(Why are you addressing him as such?)

127
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:39,051
Why can’t I?

128
00:09:39,051 --> 00:09:40,652
He's a nasty man.

129
00:09:40,652 --> 00:09:44,456
(Stop saying that, Yok. Mr. Tawi is a decent man.)

130
00:09:44,456 --> 00:09:48,750
(He offered disabled folks like myself the opportunity to work just like normal people.)

131
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,703
That’s just for his image. He will fire you later.

132
00:09:51,703 --> 00:09:54,861
(You have no idea. Don’t say things you don’t know.)

133
00:09:54,861 --> 00:10:01,108
(Even when pricks invade his manufacturer, he promises to take care of his employees.)

134
00:10:01,465 --> 00:10:04,222
Mom, how do you they are pricks?

135
00:10:04,222 --> 00:10:06,961
They could be some people who can’t take being tormented by Tawi.

136
00:10:06,961 --> 00:10:10,487
(Good guys don’t damage other people's property or cause trouble.)

137
00:10:10,487 --> 00:10:13,833
(The employees are asked to stop working and will lose their wages.)

138
00:10:31,052 --> 00:10:33,052
So your mother works at Tawi's manufacturer?

139
00:10:33,573 --> 00:10:34,669
Yes.

140
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:37,267
I knew that just now too.

141
00:10:38,543 --> 00:10:41,106
She was suspended from work because of the mess we made.

142
00:10:47,244 --> 00:10:52,024
The more people affected, the more they will oppose what we're doing.

143
00:10:52,024 --> 00:10:56,289
Those who used to be on our side might change their minds.

144
00:10:58,363 --> 00:11:00,363
I am sorry.

145
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,449
Sorry my plan got your mom in trouble.

146
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,870
It isn’t your fault.

147
00:11:10,611 --> 00:11:12,611
I don’t know anymore

148
00:11:13,222 --> 00:11:17,762
if what we’re doing is the right thing.

149
00:11:22,231 --> 00:11:24,231
Don’t overthink it.

150
00:11:24,231 --> 00:11:25,533
We’ve come this far.

151
00:11:25,533 --> 00:11:27,522
It’s not like we can back off now.

152
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,956
I’ll deal with things on my side.

153
00:11:38,691 --> 00:11:40,691
First of all,

154
00:11:40,691 --> 00:11:46,498
I must reassure you that our manufacturer has a high-quality security system.

155
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:50,002
We have lots of production cycles before we deliver the items to retail stores.

156
00:11:50,002 --> 00:11:55,791
So, I can certify that each product is of high quality.

157
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:58,659
And we're ready to pass them on to you.

158
00:11:58,659 --> 00:12:05,952
However, we need to temporarily shut down the manufacturer in order to inspect the damage.

159
00:12:05,952 --> 00:12:13,044
I assure you any employee affected by this scenario will be looked after.

160
00:12:13,044 --> 00:12:16,484
I treat them all as if they were part of my own family.

161
00:12:16,484 --> 00:12:18,841
How come we’re the villains now?

162
00:12:18,841 --> 00:12:21,437
Because he knows people will take his side if he says that.

163
00:12:21,437 --> 00:12:25,279
Turns out what we want people to know isn't even addressed.

164
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:30,714
Many people are rooting for him.

165
00:12:31,994 --> 00:12:33,994
We're so damned.

166
00:12:33,994 --> 00:12:36,446
Watching the news from mass media won’t do us any good.

167
00:12:36,446 --> 00:12:38,513
Go to the page called Lynch The News.

168
00:12:39,253 --> 00:12:40,843
Page what?

169
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,200
When we burnt down his house, it was the page that dug into the story.

170
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,393
I suppose they despise Tawi as well.

171
00:12:45,393 --> 00:12:48,280
Do you recall what we discussed in your house?

172
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:53,162
I gathered all of the information and forwarded it to them.

173
00:12:54,259 --> 00:12:57,766
Do you really think this page can be your mouthpiece?

174
00:12:57,766 --> 00:13:00,219
The page has a sizable number of followers.

175
00:13:00,714 --> 00:13:04,362
We should explain to society why we attacked Tawi's business unit.

176
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,400
[Monopoly.]

177
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,640
A lot of people are sharing the news.

178
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,613
[Adding a substance to Tawi’s products reflects smuggling drugs among his goods.]

179
00:13:12,801 --> 00:13:15,311
Shit! We’re screwed.

180
00:13:15,311 --> 00:13:16,886
There’re our pictures here too.

181
00:13:16,886 --> 00:13:18,826
Sean didn’t destroy the server?

182
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:21,734
Look. It is so far away.

183
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:23,150
We were having the masks on.

184
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,950
No one knows who we are.

185
00:13:26,488 --> 00:13:29,100
Don’t let them fight alone.

186
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,371
Let’s fight alongside our friends.

187
00:13:31,371 --> 00:13:33,685
#ROL

188
00:13:35,383 --> 00:13:36,796
Rol?

189
00:13:36,796 --> 00:13:38,088
What is it?

190
00:13:39,699 --> 00:13:41,699
My fake account.

191
00:13:41,699 --> 00:13:44,251
The one I used to send them the information.

192
00:13:44,251 --> 00:13:45,476
Rol?

193
00:13:45,476 --> 00:13:50,770
I was in a hurry. I didn’t have time to think so I used what we were discussing, rule of law.

194
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:52,679
ROL.

195
00:13:53,335 --> 00:13:55,517
Let’s check Twitter.

196
00:13:57,782 --> 00:14:02,434
Meet us in front of Tawi's company if you want to express your rage.

197
00:14:02,434 --> 00:14:03,760
Who would show up?

198
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,760
It doesn’t get many Likes.

199
00:14:10,992 --> 00:14:13,227
Black.

200
00:14:15,533 --> 00:14:18,426
Black, where are you going?

201
00:14:19,207 --> 00:14:21,377
We started everything.

202
00:14:22,134 --> 00:14:24,134
Have faith in what we're doing.

203
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:27,843
Do you even need to ask if I’m going?

204
00:14:28,557 --> 00:14:31,478
I'll go even if there are just two people there.

205
00:14:40,387 --> 00:14:42,387
Citizens!

206
00:14:42,693 --> 00:14:48,145
Put up the signs and tell them we will no longer tolerate oppression.

207
00:14:48,145 --> 00:14:49,354
Right?

208
00:14:49,354 --> 00:14:51,063
Right!

209
00:14:51,063 --> 00:14:53,063


210
00:15:14,402 --> 00:15:16,402
Citizens!

211
00:15:19,683 --> 00:15:21,683
Citizens!

212
00:15:24,981 --> 00:15:29,399
Labors are those who build this country.

213
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:30,942
Am I right?

214
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:37,008
This country moves forward because of each one of them.

215
00:15:37,194 --> 00:15:41,110
We must help build the country with fairness.

216
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:46,933
People of all genders from everywhere must be inclusive, am I right?

217
00:15:48,852 --> 00:15:51,804
But in this inequitable society,

218
00:15:51,804 --> 00:15:55,450
there is no equality in professions.

219
00:15:55,450 --> 00:16:00,999
Tawi companies not only practice monopoly

220
00:16:00,999 --> 00:16:09,333
but also discrimination, preventing persons of certain sexual orientations from working or being promoted.

221
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:15,422
Females and LGBTQ+ people are underrepresented…

222
00:16:15,532 --> 00:16:17,532
Black, we did it.

223
00:16:18,129 --> 00:16:20,129
Right?

224
00:16:20,863 --> 00:16:22,267
Citizens!

225
00:16:22,932 --> 00:16:24,705
Citizens!

226
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:31,039
Put up the signs and tell them we will no longer tolerate oppression.

227
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:32,298
Right?

228
00:16:32,298 --> 00:16:33,847
Right!

229
00:16:34,258 --> 00:16:38,079
The Labour Union must stand with us.

230
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:47,984
This is the patriarchal system that should be abolished in this nation.

231
00:17:38,134 --> 00:17:39,538
Black.

232
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:42,217
You’re here too?

233
00:17:42,217 --> 00:17:44,147
Wait for me at the tent. I have something to talk to you about.

234
00:17:44,537 --> 00:17:45,720
What tent?

235
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,341
The one in the front,

236
00:17:47,341 --> 00:17:50,050
where people sign a petition for the law amendment.

237
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,209
Black, water.

238
00:18:07,209 --> 00:18:08,072
Thank you.

239
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:09,951
Let’s check out the tent.

240
00:18:12,609 --> 00:18:14,609
Step in, please.

241
00:18:14,609 --> 00:18:16,567
Get the brochure and read the information.

242
00:18:17,493 --> 00:18:20,465
Wow! So many things here.

243
00:18:20,465 --> 00:18:26,961
Petition for the Natural Resources and Environment Committees to hear Tawi's forest trespassing case.

244
00:18:26,961 --> 00:18:29,792
Black, what we did actually matters.

245
00:18:29,792 --> 00:18:31,667
Tawi is being questioned.

246
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,500
Give me your ID card.

247
00:18:37,513 --> 00:18:39,513
I forgot to bring it.

248
00:18:39,513 --> 00:18:41,869
Attending a protest without any registration is meaningless.

249
00:18:41,869 --> 00:18:44,447
It should be driven by our rights and voices as well.

250
00:18:44,447 --> 00:18:46,925
You may register by scanning the QR code.

251
00:18:47,254 --> 00:18:48,834
It’s nice.

252
00:18:48,834 --> 00:18:51,493
You can call out for whatever you want in here.

253
00:18:57,911 --> 00:18:59,911
I think this is what’s happening.

254
00:18:59,911 --> 00:19:02,250
Everyone hates Tawi.

255
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:06,080
When they see someone standing against him, they do the same.

256
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,822
And it’s become a mob.

257
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:12,191
What’s that?

258
00:19:12,191 --> 00:19:14,970
Petition for Trade Competition Act amendment.

259
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:17,511
Gram, you must sign up for this one.

260
00:19:17,511 --> 00:19:19,131
You’re so into this.

261
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:22,541
You can put it here.

262
00:19:30,054 --> 00:19:32,628
Hey, would you excuse me?

263
00:19:32,628 --> 00:19:35,691
I'll go over to the other tents and see what else I should sign up for.

264
00:19:53,945 --> 00:19:56,740
Why don’t you ever pick up my calls?

265
00:19:57,397 --> 00:19:59,397
I've been preoccupied.

266
00:19:59,819 --> 00:20:01,819
Are you mad at me again?

267
00:20:03,297 --> 00:20:05,297
No, I’m not.

268
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:08,114
You’re worrying me.

269
00:20:08,648 --> 00:20:11,781
Please tell me what I did this time that got you upset.

270
00:20:20,107 --> 00:20:22,107
I saw you and Gram hugging.

271
00:20:25,034 --> 00:20:27,034
You followed me?

272
00:20:27,553 --> 00:20:29,897
Are you two secretly dating?

273
00:20:31,193 --> 00:20:33,193
We’re not.

274
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:35,570
I will tell you the truth

275
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:37,729
but you need to wait until I finish the whole story.

276
00:20:44,695 --> 00:20:46,695
I kissed Gram.

277
00:20:50,036 --> 00:20:52,919
Don’t frown. Don’t get mad yet.

278
00:20:53,944 --> 00:20:55,944
Let me finish.

279
00:20:56,409 --> 00:21:01,166
You broke up with me and said you would risk your life doing something.

280
00:21:01,586 --> 00:21:03,462
I didn’t get anything you said.

281
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:05,926
You didn’t answer anything I asked.

282
00:21:07,373 --> 00:21:09,373
Know what?

283
00:21:09,373 --> 00:21:13,157
Knowing nothing is the worst thing ever.

284
00:21:14,557 --> 00:21:16,557
Black, talk to me.

285
00:21:16,557 --> 00:21:18,341
Whatever it is, say it.

286
00:21:18,341 --> 00:21:19,849
What? Talk to me, Black.

287
00:21:19,849 --> 00:21:21,160
Where are you going?

288
00:21:22,843 --> 00:21:24,843
Say what’s on your mind.

289
00:21:25,572 --> 00:21:27,572
I’m sorry.

290
00:21:27,976 --> 00:21:29,976
I don’t want to risk you too.

291
00:21:31,069 --> 00:21:33,069
Doing what?

292
00:21:33,069 --> 00:21:35,321
Whatever it is, just tell me.

293
00:21:36,011 --> 00:21:38,673
I can’t make sense of that little information you give.

294
00:21:40,569 --> 00:21:42,569
I can get killed any minute.

295
00:21:43,324 --> 00:21:45,324
Why?

296
00:21:46,042 --> 00:21:48,042
Fill me in.

297
00:21:49,846 --> 00:21:51,846
I am your girlfriend.

298
00:21:54,178 --> 00:21:56,178
That’s all you should know.

299
00:21:56,178 --> 00:21:58,203
You won’t get it.

300
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:01,630
We’re over. Don’t waste your time on me.

301
00:22:13,115 --> 00:22:15,115
You’ll be okay.

302
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,915
I am sorry.

303
00:22:59,853 --> 00:23:01,345
Screw it.

304
00:23:01,345 --> 00:23:03,214
Just forget it happened.

305
00:23:11,971 --> 00:23:13,971
That day when I went to see Gram,

306
00:23:13,971 --> 00:23:18,827
I asked him not to tell you about the kiss.

307
00:23:19,675 --> 00:23:22,413
I wanted him to keep it a secret.

308
00:23:26,979 --> 00:23:28,979
I was crying.

309
00:23:30,049 --> 00:23:32,049
And Gram was just comforting me.

310
00:23:32,669 --> 00:23:37,189
(So the conflict between Gram and Black is now out of the picture.)

311
00:23:37,785 --> 00:23:41,156
(Black wasn’t in trouble just because of his love life.)

312
00:23:41,156 --> 00:23:45,391
(There’s just one person left who can harm Black, and that’s Tawi.)

313
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:49,805
Thank you so much for telling the truth.

314
00:23:52,802 --> 00:23:56,411
But I honestly have no idea of what I should do now.

315
00:23:59,706 --> 00:24:01,706
Do you still want me by your side?

316
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:06,702
If you don’t, you can tell me honestly.

317
00:24:10,504 --> 00:24:12,504
I want to stop thinking things in my head.

318
00:24:12,504 --> 00:24:14,553
I want clarification.

319
00:24:15,284 --> 00:24:18,278
Eugene, you need to perform the next show.

320
00:24:20,148 --> 00:24:22,148
Answer me.

321
00:24:25,625 --> 00:24:27,625
Black.

322
00:24:29,906 --> 00:24:31,906
Black, answer me.

323
00:24:32,911 --> 00:24:37,495
(My brother must have his own way of protecting someone he loves.)

324
00:24:37,495 --> 00:24:41,076
(And this girl must love Black very much.)

325
00:24:52,462 --> 00:24:55,875
(Saying nothing is probably the best option.)

326
00:24:58,607 --> 00:25:03,677
(It’s better than pretending to be Black and causing her more pain.)

327
00:25:39,399 --> 00:25:40,747
Black.

328
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,716
Let’s visit some other tents.

329
00:25:53,075 --> 00:25:55,075
Let’s witness

330
00:25:55,075 --> 00:25:57,075
the marriage equality fashion show!

331
00:25:57,075 --> 00:25:59,075


332
00:26:23,294 --> 00:26:26,060
Petition for same-sex marriage law amendment.

333
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:29,876
Support same-sex marriage law amendment, please.

334
00:26:31,888 --> 00:26:33,888
Hey, Nuch.

335
00:26:33,888 --> 00:26:35,529
You’re here too?

336
00:26:35,529 --> 00:26:36,846
What a surprise.

337
00:26:36,846 --> 00:26:41,321
LGBT folks need to get support from a place full of people.

338
00:26:41,452 --> 00:26:46,742
Especially, any event addressing basic human rights and social injustice,

339
00:26:46,742 --> 00:26:48,029
of course, I’d come.

340
00:26:48,029 --> 00:26:50,507
We even get 2-3 thousand supporters today.

341
00:26:50,638 --> 00:26:53,028
If you want to sign up, you can.

342
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:56,165
You can do it on paper and online.

343
00:26:56,493 --> 00:26:57,919
Scan here.

344
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:03,019
Whether it’s a male-male, male-female, or female-female couple,

345
00:27:03,019 --> 00:27:07,119
we’ll all benefit equally from this law amendment.

346
00:27:08,094 --> 00:27:12,209
Most people might not think it’s necessary

347
00:27:12,209 --> 00:27:14,128
but consider it,

348
00:27:14,128 --> 00:27:21,431
you or people around you might be needing this.

349
00:27:22,274 --> 00:27:24,274
Have you signed up?

350
00:27:24,274 --> 00:27:27,137
Your trans wife has been waiting here.

351
00:27:27,137 --> 00:27:28,853
I already did, sweetheart.

352
00:27:28,853 --> 00:27:32,250
Do you want me to go home and show you the proof?

353
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:34,731
You’re too much.

354
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:37,821
I need to get going.

355
00:27:37,821 --> 00:27:39,009
Leaving?

356
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:41,359
See you later, Nuch.

357
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:44,608
Are you staying until late at night?

358
00:27:44,608 --> 00:27:48,295
If you are, you’ll get to see the highlight.

359
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:50,301
What highlight?

360
00:27:50,845 --> 00:27:52,845
Citizens!

361
00:27:55,539 --> 00:27:57,539
Citizens!

362
00:28:01,242 --> 00:28:03,242
Let’s witness

363
00:28:03,242 --> 00:28:06,436
the marriage equality fashion show!

364
00:29:36,193 --> 00:29:38,193
Tawi, get out!

365
00:29:40,754 --> 00:29:42,754
Marriage equality!

366
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,558
Tawi, get out!

367
00:29:46,768 --> 00:29:48,768
Marriage equality!

368
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,739
Tawi, get out!

369
00:29:50,994 --> 00:29:52,599
Tawi, get out!

370
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:55,359
Marriage equality!

371
00:29:55,574 --> 00:29:57,205
Marriage equality!

372
00:29:58,078 --> 00:30:00,078
Tawi, get out!

373
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:02,678
Marriage equality!

374
00:30:02,678 --> 00:30:04,330
Tawi, get out!

375
00:30:04,478 --> 00:30:05,943
You’re here too?

376
00:30:05,943 --> 00:30:07,380
Yeah, just stop by to see.

377
00:30:08,167 --> 00:30:10,167
Do you have anything to say to me?

378
00:30:10,167 --> 00:30:10,931
No.

379
00:30:10,931 --> 00:30:12,698
What? I can’t hear you.

380
00:30:12,698 --> 00:30:14,095
I don’t have anything to say to you.

381
00:30:15,198 --> 00:30:17,198
Are you sure?

382
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:20,107
Tawi, get out!

383
00:30:20,357 --> 00:30:22,024
Tawi, get out!

384
00:30:22,243 --> 00:30:23,715
Tawi, get out!

385
00:30:23,983 --> 00:30:25,983
Tawi, get out!

386
00:30:26,618 --> 00:30:28,027
Marriage equality!

387
00:30:28,356 --> 00:30:29,961
Marriage equality!

388
00:31:19,318 --> 00:31:21,318
Shit! I have never felt this great before.

389
00:31:21,318 --> 00:31:23,098
I watched the latest news,

390
00:31:23,098 --> 00:31:26,338
Tawi said there were some people trying to attack him.

391
00:31:26,338 --> 00:31:30,529
When the reporters asked if what is going on is related to his forest trespassing case,

392
00:31:30,529 --> 00:31:33,050
he became enraged and stormed out in front of them.

393
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:34,582
It was very satisfying.

394
00:31:36,143 --> 00:31:38,997
That suggests our efforts were somewhat effective.

395
00:31:40,875 --> 00:31:43,451
Black, why didn’t you come up with a different group name?

396
00:31:43,451 --> 00:31:45,772
ROL doesn’t sound very cool.

397
00:31:45,772 --> 00:31:48,069
I was in a rush. I didn’t get enough time to be creative.

398
00:31:48,069 --> 00:31:50,204
I didn’t know they would use this name to call us.

399
00:31:50,204 --> 00:31:52,440
It can mean various things though.

400
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,105
It can be ‘Rolling.’

401
00:31:54,105 --> 00:31:57,104
When we fall, there are still people who keep rolling.

402
00:31:57,104 --> 00:31:59,177
Because this is for everyone.

403
00:31:59,714 --> 00:32:01,072
You’re just rambling.

404
00:32:01,072 --> 00:32:02,244
You are right.

405
00:32:04,246 --> 00:32:06,246
What did you just do?

406
00:32:06,246 --> 00:32:07,538
Come on.

407
00:32:07,538 --> 00:32:11,146
Now everyone knows how filthy Tawi is.

408
00:32:11,146 --> 00:32:13,863
Let’s see how many people are coming to the street.

409
00:32:13,863 --> 00:32:16,598
Then let’s celebrate Black’s achievement.

410
00:32:16,598 --> 00:32:17,918
Cheers.

411
00:32:22,549 --> 00:32:26,498
Hey, this is huge.

412
00:32:26,498 --> 00:32:29,083
I heard from my guys in the inner circle that Tawi is enraged.

413
00:32:29,083 --> 00:32:31,612
He ordered his troops to capture you.

414
00:32:31,612 --> 00:32:34,142
There's even a bounty on your head now.

415
00:32:34,292 --> 00:32:36,437
Just be careful.

416
00:32:38,004 --> 00:32:40,004
A douchebag is always doing douchebag things.

417
00:32:40,418 --> 00:32:42,935
Because we jeopardized his benefit.

418
00:32:43,473 --> 00:32:48,385
The more people that speak out against his evilness, the more money he’ll lose.

419
00:33:00,803 --> 00:33:05,321
The project I’m presenting here is called Proletariat Expressionism.

420
00:33:05,321 --> 00:33:07,726
Interesting term. Not widely mentioned.

421
00:33:07,726 --> 00:33:10,428
What does it mean to you, Yok?

422
00:33:10,713 --> 00:33:13,898
It is to utilize nude pictures to express the proletariat.

423
00:33:13,898 --> 00:33:18,027
Its purpose is to demonstrate human beauty using signs of the proletariat.

424
00:33:18,027 --> 00:33:20,645
Why proletariat?

425
00:33:20,645 --> 00:33:22,236
Why can’t it be?

426
00:33:22,236 --> 00:33:24,242
Of course, it can be anything.

427
00:33:24,242 --> 00:33:27,502
But how does this concept appeal to you?

428
00:33:32,612 --> 00:33:34,612
Nude, to me, can be a variety of things

429
00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:44,719
My idea is to utilize nude pictures to depict the signs and bodies of the proletariat, those who are socially victimized by injustice.

430
00:33:44,916 --> 00:33:48,035
My work will be in expressionism style.

431
00:33:48,035 --> 00:33:52,083
The colors used will represent pain and cruelty.

432
00:33:52,298 --> 00:33:58,062
I'll blend those colors to create a nude picture that indicates the tormented second class.

433
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:00,890
And I'd want to question

434
00:34:02,348 --> 00:34:06,869
why we can't convey beauty via the suffering of the proletariat

435
00:34:07,424 --> 00:34:11,052
and who says that beauty is only for a certain group of people.

436
00:34:15,281 --> 00:34:17,281
Interesting. It’s a yes from me.

437
00:34:17,281 --> 00:34:19,573
You can start working on this project now.

438
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:22,960
Those who don’t get your projects approved yet,

439
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,252
please do more research…

440
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:28,208
Excuse me. I haven’t finished my class yet.

441
00:34:30,207 --> 00:34:35,642
Professor Montian, there’s police asking to see your student, Mr. Jade.

442
00:34:36,815 --> 00:34:38,815
Yok, what did you do?

443
00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:42,136
I heard from my guys in the inner circle that Tawi is enraged.

444
00:34:42,136 --> 00:34:43,865
He ordered his troops to capture you.

445
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:47,650
There's even a bounty on your head now.

446
00:34:47,968 --> 00:34:50,491
Professor, would you please excuse me?

447
00:34:50,491 --> 00:34:54,841
Did he say what he wanted to talk to him about?

448
00:34:55,684 --> 00:34:58,041
He just needs some piece of information.

449
00:34:58,923 --> 00:35:00,923
Where is he right now?

450
00:35:01,131 --> 00:35:02,717
Downstairs.

451
00:35:03,406 --> 00:35:06,457
OK, then please take care of…

452
00:35:06,457 --> 00:35:07,305
Hey!

453
00:35:07,352 --> 00:35:08,582
Yok!

454
00:35:28,848 --> 00:35:29,999
Gotcha.

455
00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:33,362
Let go of me!

456
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,416
Let go!

457
00:35:52,759 --> 00:35:54,474
I said let go.

458
00:35:55,065 --> 00:35:56,720
Where are you taking me?

459
00:35:56,878 --> 00:35:58,159
What did I do?

460
00:35:59,692 --> 00:36:01,692
Stop talking.

461
00:36:05,323 --> 00:36:06,995
Get in.

462
00:36:11,089 --> 00:36:13,396
Are you that afraid I’d run away?

463
00:36:24,844 --> 00:36:26,844
Where are you taking me?

464
00:36:38,096 --> 00:36:40,687
If you don’t stop messing around, you’ll be put in jail.

465
00:36:40,687 --> 00:36:42,551
Say where you’re taking me then.

466
00:36:44,565 --> 00:36:45,645
Hey!

467
00:36:57,142 --> 00:37:00,302
My card that you took, where is it?

468
00:37:00,302 --> 00:37:02,194
If you want it back, search for it, officer.

469
00:37:02,194 --> 00:37:04,194


470
00:37:50,202 --> 00:37:51,945
Why did you take me to a deserted building?

471
00:37:51,945 --> 00:37:53,249
You’re a cop.

472
00:37:53,329 --> 00:37:55,426
Why didn’t you take me to a police station?

473
00:38:09,318 --> 00:38:11,318
It’s right there.

474
00:38:11,318 --> 00:38:12,972
Why don’t you take me there?

475
00:38:14,031 --> 00:38:16,336
Police, I’m being kidnapped!

476
00:38:16,336 --> 00:38:17,683
Be quiet.

477
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:21,363
Let go of me. I will stop shouting.

478
00:38:27,103 --> 00:38:29,103
Keep walking.

479
00:38:34,404 --> 00:38:36,404
Cross it.

480
00:38:40,969 --> 00:38:42,969
Do it.

481
00:39:08,463 --> 00:39:10,065
Should have uncuffed me a long time ago.

482
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,331
I will.

483
00:39:14,419 --> 00:39:16,419
Hey! What are you doing?

484
00:39:19,602 --> 00:39:21,602
Let’s have a fistfight if you dare.

485
00:39:21,602 --> 00:39:23,269
Don’t think I can’t take you down.

486
00:39:23,794 --> 00:39:27,089
My card that you took, where is it?

487
00:39:32,369 --> 00:39:33,854
Shit! He’s a cop.

488
00:39:33,854 --> 00:39:35,525
You’re looking for it, huh?

489
00:39:37,179 --> 00:39:40,202
If you want it back, search for it, officer.

490
00:39:54,572 --> 00:39:56,572
Where would it be?

491
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:03,447
Wonder where it is.

492
00:40:03,447 --> 00:40:05,370
Should I take off my pants?

493
00:40:21,854 --> 00:40:23,854
What kind of cop are you?

494
00:40:23,854 --> 00:40:25,387
You took so long to find something.

495
00:40:28,622 --> 00:40:30,014
How do you feel?

496
00:40:30,014 --> 00:40:31,316
About what?

497
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:36,372
Being both a cop and an artist who runs from cops.

498
00:40:40,202 --> 00:40:42,202
What are you doing it for?

499
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:46,724
I want to make things better than they are now.

500
00:40:48,213 --> 00:40:50,213
You can't do it as a cop, can you?

501
00:40:50,353 --> 00:40:52,353
‘Police Serve The People’

502
00:40:52,353 --> 00:40:54,245
That motto is a bit surreal, I guess.

503
00:40:55,856 --> 00:40:59,073
When you are interested in or focused on something,

504
00:40:59,073 --> 00:41:00,930
it is all you see.

505
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:04,177
But in reality, police officers are responsible for far more than what you see.

506
00:41:04,692 --> 00:41:11,162
The issues that receive public attention make up a small percentage compared to other tasks that you do not focus on.

507
00:41:11,163 --> 00:41:13,959
It isn’t right to focus only on what you care about

508
00:41:13,959 --> 00:41:16,882
and say we don’t do anything at all.

509
00:41:16,882 --> 00:41:18,170
What now?

510
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:19,959
Loving your organization all of a sudden?

511
00:41:21,548 --> 00:41:23,548
What I see in your artwork

512
00:41:23,548 --> 00:41:26,950
contradicts what you've just said.

513
00:41:29,607 --> 00:41:31,607
I like your skill so much.

514
00:41:33,183 --> 00:41:34,682
My skill?

515
00:41:34,682 --> 00:41:35,824
Yes.

516
00:41:36,073 --> 00:41:38,658
I've seen a lot of social satire artwork.

517
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:41,565
But I'm more interested in the quality here.

518
00:41:52,949 --> 00:41:57,570
You’re the first to look at the quality rather than the story behind it.

519
00:41:58,617 --> 00:42:00,617
I appreciate your lines

520
00:42:01,846 --> 00:42:04,712
and the beauty you created.

521
00:42:05,845 --> 00:42:07,845
I think they are very honest.

522
00:42:11,117 --> 00:42:13,117
I didn’t graduate arts.

523
00:42:13,611 --> 00:42:16,487
I can’t tell if what you said is good or bad.

524
00:42:16,487 --> 00:42:17,555
It is good.

525
00:42:17,555 --> 00:42:21,809
Art is art. It has nothing to do with your field of study.

526
00:42:22,552 --> 00:42:27,153
Artists who studied art and those who did not are both unique.

527
00:42:31,779 --> 00:42:34,639
Will you uncuff me so we can have a proper conversation?

528
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:40,090
I won’t run away.

529
00:42:40,202 --> 00:42:42,010
I’m serious.

530
00:42:42,396 --> 00:42:44,232
It hurts.

531
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:48,660
Fine.

532
00:43:01,915 --> 00:43:03,915
Can I see your work?

533
00:43:15,741 --> 00:43:20,432
I looked for you because I wanted to understand you better.

534
00:43:21,681 --> 00:43:23,681
I wanted to know what you were thinking.

535
00:43:26,176 --> 00:43:27,521
Ask me.

536
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:30,808
Why did you become a cop instead of an artist?

537
00:43:34,624 --> 00:43:37,513
I’ve enjoyed painting since I was a kid.

538
00:43:37,988 --> 00:43:41,760
I just didn’t think I could make a serious living out of it.

539
00:43:42,430 --> 00:43:44,430
But guess what?

540
00:43:44,430 --> 00:43:47,894
It turns out that NFT earns me more than being a cop.

541
00:43:49,699 --> 00:43:52,752
How did you get in here? Isn't it guarded by someone?

542
00:43:52,752 --> 00:43:55,890
There is one. I spoke with him.

543
00:43:55,890 --> 00:43:57,534
He’s an old man.

544
00:43:57,534 --> 00:44:00,483
I told him I just wanted to store some things here

545
00:44:00,483 --> 00:44:01,952
And he didn’t get suspicious?

546
00:44:01,952 --> 00:44:04,656
I’m a cop around here. Who could possibly have doubts about me?

547
00:44:04,656 --> 00:44:05,928
Wow!

548
00:44:06,797 --> 00:44:08,797
Yes, officer.

549
00:44:10,634 --> 00:44:12,634
Ask me questions.

550
00:44:12,634 --> 00:44:14,774
You took me here.

551
00:44:14,774 --> 00:44:17,006
I guess you’re interested in me somehow.

552
00:44:26,047 --> 00:44:30,738
I want to know why you and your pals chose to do that.

553
00:44:31,748 --> 00:44:33,748
Do you think it will work?

554
00:44:36,163 --> 00:44:40,527
And what you’ve been doing, does it work?

555
00:44:43,771 --> 00:44:45,771
We chose our own way

556
00:44:45,771 --> 00:44:48,429
because those guys thought our voices were quiet.

557
00:44:48,429 --> 00:44:51,532
They're so silent that no matter how loud we shouted,

558
00:44:51,532 --> 00:44:53,119
they wouldn’t hear us.

559
00:44:55,756 --> 00:44:57,756
That's why we had to create our own voices.

560
00:44:58,658 --> 00:45:02,904
Do you realize that what you’re doing is also wrong?

561
00:45:02,904 --> 00:45:04,559
Just like those people.

562
00:45:04,873 --> 00:45:06,161
I do.

563
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:08,126
I have always realized it.

564
00:45:08,126 --> 00:45:11,698
I never consider myself a hero who fights for justice.

565
00:45:12,212 --> 00:45:15,787
I just feel like I need to do something

566
00:45:15,787 --> 00:45:18,513
to make them see that what they do

567
00:45:18,513 --> 00:45:20,621
is exploiting others.

568
00:45:23,898 --> 00:45:27,115
That means you’re willing to be arrested from the start, right?

569
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:29,449
Arrest me if you want.

570
00:45:29,449 --> 00:45:31,295
I’m up for it.

571
00:45:31,295 --> 00:45:32,798
Do it.

572
00:45:40,061 --> 00:45:42,061
What if I don’t?

573
00:45:42,459 --> 00:45:44,278
Can I take it as a favor?

574
00:45:46,045 --> 00:45:48,045
Are you sure it’s a favor?

575
00:45:48,876 --> 00:45:50,876
I see it as a quid pro quo.

576
00:46:00,073 --> 00:46:02,073
Let’s make a deal.

577
00:46:02,073 --> 00:46:03,524
I won’t say anything about you.

578
00:46:03,945 --> 00:46:06,341
You won’t say anything about me.

579
00:46:07,017 --> 00:46:09,017
As the matter of fact,

580
00:46:09,441 --> 00:46:12,787
you painted me the last time without asking for my consent.

581
00:46:18,836 --> 00:46:20,836
I just got busted.

582
00:46:23,153 --> 00:46:25,153
Of course, you can paint me.

583
00:46:25,366 --> 00:46:27,968
Let’s call it even then.

584
00:46:32,851 --> 00:46:34,851
Come here.

585
00:46:37,434 --> 00:46:38,943
Sit down.

586
00:46:38,943 --> 00:46:40,733
Sit and don’t move.

587
00:46:50,202 --> 00:46:52,202
What are you doing?

588
00:46:52,608 --> 00:46:54,918
You painted me.

589
00:46:55,671 --> 00:46:57,671
It’s my turn to draw you.

590
00:47:02,048 --> 00:47:03,159
Draw what?

591
00:47:04,078 --> 00:47:06,078
A portrait.

592
00:47:40,977 --> 00:47:42,649
I want to talk to you.

593
00:47:43,028 --> 00:47:45,028
About what?

594
00:47:45,707 --> 00:47:47,707
You know what it’s about.

595
00:47:49,058 --> 00:47:51,058
But I don’t want to talk to you.

596
00:47:59,868 --> 00:48:01,868
Get inside.

597
00:48:08,024 --> 00:48:12,271
Directed by Anucha Boonyawatana

598
00:48:14,592 --> 00:48:16,592
Fake sleeping?

599
00:48:16,592 --> 00:48:18,259
You’re so inebriated.

600
00:48:18,259 --> 00:48:22,703
My project is about people who are victims of our society's injustice.

601
00:48:22,703 --> 00:48:24,502
Can you take off your clothes?

602
00:48:24,806 --> 00:48:26,059
What? Do I really have to?

603
00:48:26,059 --> 00:48:27,425
Tawi keeps his drugs here.

604
00:48:27,425 --> 00:48:29,322
I want you to keep an eye on it.

605
00:48:29,322 --> 00:48:31,191
Why didn't you ask Gram and Yok along?

606
00:48:31,636 --> 00:48:33,861
They're not very skilled at spying.

607
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:36,067
You’re the right one.
