4
00:00:18,209 --> 00:00:19,786
If I hadn’t gotten involved in this,

5
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:20,733
things wouldn’t have turned out this way.

6
00:00:20,894 --> 00:00:22,400
But you had.

7
00:00:22,478 --> 00:00:23,931
And now you decide to just disappear?

8
00:00:23,931 --> 00:00:24,953
I’m sorry.

9
00:00:24,953 --> 00:00:26,561
You wanna pay?

10
00:00:26,561 --> 00:00:27,931
Be dead just like my father.

11
00:00:27,931 --> 00:00:28,602
Hey!

12
00:00:28,874 --> 00:00:29,705
What are you doing?

13
00:00:29,705 --> 00:00:30,823
You’re all talk.

14
00:00:30,823 --> 00:00:31,910
Why didn’t you shoot?

15
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:34,497
I told you to never show your face again.

16
00:00:34,497 --> 00:00:35,593
I was wrong.

17
00:00:35,593 --> 00:00:36,936
I thought I could walk away from you.

18
00:00:37,066 --> 00:00:39,066
I’m not going anywhere. I promise.

19
00:00:39,066 --> 00:00:40,394
Did you get the photos, Sean?

20
00:00:40,518 --> 00:00:41,198
We did.

21
00:00:41,611 --> 00:00:43,885
A guy standing next to me isn’t Black.

22
00:00:43,885 --> 00:00:46,194
I’m White, Black’s twin brother.

23
00:00:46,494 --> 00:00:47,798
Stay with me.

24
00:01:06,255 --> 00:01:10,000
Are these photos enough to build a case?

25
00:01:11,256 --> 00:01:12,410
For a drug case,

26
00:01:12,918 --> 00:01:14,918
even with small evidence, we can get a search warrant issued.

27
00:01:15,758 --> 00:01:20,480
But I’m not sure if these photos are strong enough to be considered probable cause.

28
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:22,769
How much do you need then?

29
00:01:23,398 --> 00:01:25,100
Do you want me to catch them and bring the drug here to show you?

30
00:01:25,307 --> 00:01:26,262
I haven’t finished.

31
00:01:26,765 --> 00:01:30,000
I will leave it to someone I trust so he can take on the job.

32
00:01:31,096 --> 00:01:33,096
His warehouse is going to be searched as you planned it.

33
00:01:34,773 --> 00:01:37,047
What are you going to do after that?

34
00:01:39,704 --> 00:01:41,032
Those guys will be like rats rushing out of their holes.

35
00:01:41,354 --> 00:01:42,832
They will relocate the drugs.

36
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,811
Then we will take their truck.

37
00:01:45,048 --> 00:01:46,720
Dump the drugs and revile them publicly.

38
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,367
You should report the drugs to the police.

39
00:01:48,537 --> 00:01:50,720
It’s hard to keep them under control if they are dumped on the street.

40
00:01:51,023 --> 00:01:53,321
If people take the drugs, it will be an issue.

41
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,982
If you don’t contact the police in advance and you have the exhibit with you,

42
00:01:56,982 --> 00:01:58,563
you will become a suspect.

43
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,349
Don’t teach me.

44
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:03,968
If the police are reliable, we won’t have to risk ourselves like this.

45
00:02:07,013 --> 00:02:08,416
He just wants to explain.

46
00:02:09,304 --> 00:02:10,334
Why don’t you try to listen?

47
00:02:10,884 --> 00:02:11,665
It’s a waste of time.

48
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,011
Words alone aren’t trustworthy enough for me.

49
00:02:15,459 --> 00:02:16,962
I want to see his actions.

50
00:02:18,163 --> 00:02:18,869
Sure.

51
00:02:19,441 --> 00:02:20,412
Don’t worry about that.

52
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:24,349
(I understand Dan’s attempt here.)

53
00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:27,520
(He’s like me who used to be blind before.)

54
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,444
(We both try to fix the wrong things our own way.)

55
00:03:47,409 --> 00:03:48,398
Does it still hurt?

56
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:51,697
No.

57
00:03:58,164 --> 00:03:59,368
What’s that look on your face then?

58
00:04:01,236 --> 00:04:02,664
Are you thinking about what’s going to happen?

59
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,000
What can be happening?

60
00:04:10,431 --> 00:04:11,635
Tell me. I’d like to know.

61
00:04:13,244 --> 00:04:14,846
If things don’t go as expected,

62
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,863
I might be disciplined

63
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:20,960
or sent to the border somewhere.

64
00:04:22,414 --> 00:04:25,434
What’s worst is that I might be gone for goods.

65
00:04:33,386 --> 00:04:34,540
Where can you go?

66
00:04:36,532 --> 00:04:37,736
You can’t run away from me.

67
00:04:37,925 --> 00:04:38,831
You know that, don’t you?

68
00:04:45,499 --> 00:04:47,574
I might not come back here for a while.

69
00:04:54,001 --> 00:04:55,840
If you want to go, why don’t you just go tonight?

70
00:04:58,824 --> 00:05:00,152
I will even help you pack.

71
00:05:16,342 --> 00:05:17,447
You’re not okay, are you?

72
00:05:19,441 --> 00:05:20,197
No.

73
00:05:25,622 --> 00:05:28,940
When everything is over, I’ll take you to a place.

74
00:05:33,657 --> 00:05:34,533
Where?

75
00:05:34,831 --> 00:05:35,955
My home in Chanthaburi.

76
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,443
My parents live there.

77
00:05:40,428 --> 00:05:41,533
They have a longan farm.

78
00:05:45,851 --> 00:05:47,627
You want to take me to your parents now?

79
00:05:48,773 --> 00:05:50,350
You’re planning far ahead, officer.

80
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,912
I saw you living with your mom.

81
00:06:10,868 --> 00:06:12,346
That reminded me of my own home.

82
00:06:16,128 --> 00:06:17,129
Wait for me.

83
00:06:19,193 --> 00:06:20,000
Do you understand that?

84
00:06:29,528 --> 00:06:31,304
I will not let this go wrong.

85
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:34,796
I will win this fight together.

86
00:06:36,711 --> 00:06:37,508
I promise.

87
00:06:47,626 --> 00:06:51,093
Gather round and see Tawi’s nastiness together.

88
00:06:51,294 --> 00:06:54,264
Apart from his warehouses and companies,

89
00:06:54,264 --> 00:06:56,667
he has this place as a shell corporation.

90
00:06:56,823 --> 00:06:58,450
It’s his dog food shop.

91
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:01,481
A place for crazy-dog politicians to gang up.

92
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:09,280
There must be no more monopoly.

93
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,507
We will destroy their dog house.

94
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:16,296
If the dogs come, we will capture them.

95
00:07:16,552 --> 00:07:17,284
But…

96
00:07:17,678 --> 00:07:22,364
if the dog owner comes, we will definitely go all out.

97
00:07:22,563 --> 00:07:24,789
Tawi, get out.

98
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:27,362
Get out!

99
00:07:27,362 --> 00:07:29,068
[Get the hell out!]

100
00:07:29,068 --> 00:07:36,915
Get out!

101
00:07:37,619 --> 00:07:38,823
Hi, Namo.

102
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:39,660
Hey.

103
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,292
You’re here too?

104
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:43,513
I thought you guys stopped painting already.

105
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,520
Haven’t seen your signature street art anywhere for a while.

106
00:07:49,111 --> 00:07:50,887
I actually changed my style.

107
00:07:51,148 --> 00:07:54,093
I’m now doing social satire artwork.

108
00:07:54,093 --> 00:08:00,801
Seeing this kind of energy makes me realize that it's worthwhile to contribute to society.

109
00:08:03,161 --> 00:08:04,116
That’s good.

110
00:08:04,515 --> 00:08:06,217
Does it mean you got over him already?

111
00:08:08,698 --> 00:08:09,761
Wanna help?

112
00:08:12,522 --> 00:08:13,310
Of course.

113
00:08:13,681 --> 00:08:14,424
How?

114
00:08:14,523 --> 00:08:15,307
I just paint it?

115
00:08:15,736 --> 00:08:17,736
Just follow the pattern I drew.

116
00:08:18,893 --> 00:08:22,880
Actually, I do have a much bigger thing to focus on.

117
00:08:23,659 --> 00:08:27,524
If I can’t get rid of a tiny little thing that bugs me,

118
00:08:28,109 --> 00:08:30,805
my goal will never be achieved.

119
00:08:35,805 --> 00:08:36,453
Hey!

120
00:08:36,453 --> 00:08:37,507
Tawi’s in that van.

121
00:08:48,101 --> 00:08:50,250
How do you want me to handle this, sir?

122
00:08:50,858 --> 00:08:54,052
The customers at this avenue might get troubled.

123
00:09:00,796 --> 00:09:01,776
That’s okay.

124
00:09:02,599 --> 00:09:04,251
Assign them the protest area.

125
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,237
It’s their right to protest.

126
00:09:08,765 --> 00:09:11,760
Make sure to tell our men not to harm them.

127
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,474
I want no more problems.

128
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:17,643
[Where there is power, there is a scapegoat.]

129
00:09:32,334 --> 00:09:34,160
That was satisfying.

130
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,163
Hey, Gram.

131
00:09:37,163 --> 00:09:38,062
Just got here?

132
00:09:38,574 --> 00:09:39,679
You missed the highlight.

133
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,021
Tawi’s car just passed through.

134
00:09:43,328 --> 00:09:45,477
I should get going.

135
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,956
Still got work to do.

136
00:09:47,889 --> 00:09:48,480
Let’s go.

137
00:09:48,579 --> 00:09:49,269
See you.

138
00:09:50,649 --> 00:09:51,505
What is it?

139
00:09:52,764 --> 00:09:54,490
We haven’t talked again since then.

140
00:09:55,798 --> 00:09:57,040
Can I talk to you?

141
00:09:58,831 --> 00:09:59,763
Sure.

142
00:10:06,604 --> 00:10:08,131
Drink some water.

143
00:10:08,131 --> 00:10:09,380
Thank you.

144
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,235
So?

145
00:10:16,732 --> 00:10:17,674
What do you want to say to me?

146
00:10:21,719 --> 00:10:22,973
I wanted to see you.

147
00:10:23,857 --> 00:10:25,000
I need reassurance.

148
00:10:26,463 --> 00:10:27,713
What reassurance?

149
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,750
I don’t know.

150
00:10:31,691 --> 00:10:33,691
I’m going to do something so dangerous.

151
00:10:34,531 --> 00:10:35,835
I don’t know what will happen.

152
00:10:36,474 --> 00:10:37,479
How dangerous?

153
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,968
I’m sorry.

154
00:10:42,913 --> 00:10:43,985
I can’t tell you that.

155
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:47,434
Not this again.

156
00:10:47,753 --> 00:10:48,440
Why?

157
00:10:49,087 --> 00:10:51,146
Why isn't anyone telling me anything?

158
00:10:51,227 --> 00:10:52,800
Am I not trustworthy enough?

159
00:10:53,256 --> 00:10:54,004
Hey

160
00:10:54,302 --> 00:10:55,256
it’s not that.

161
00:10:57,137 --> 00:10:57,943
Gram,

162
00:10:58,743 --> 00:11:01,760
I know exactly what you and Black are doing.

163
00:11:02,917 --> 00:11:04,270
Black didn’t tell me.

164
00:11:04,948 --> 00:11:06,426
I figured it out myself.

165
00:11:07,256 --> 00:11:08,783
And don’t worry.

166
00:11:09,547 --> 00:11:10,751
I won’t tell anybody about this.

167
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:18,256
Listen to me.

168
00:11:19,807 --> 00:11:22,827
I promise I won’t hurt you like you’ve been hurt before.

169
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:27,281
When all of this is over, I will tell you everything.

170
00:11:29,956 --> 00:11:30,961
Literally everything.

171
00:11:44,086 --> 00:11:45,000
Can you wait for me?

172
00:11:51,238 --> 00:11:52,517
I’ve been waiting for so long already.

173
00:11:53,022 --> 00:11:54,208
A little longer won’t kill me.

174
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,152
What?

175
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,000
You said you’re doing something dangerous.

176
00:12:04,529 --> 00:12:05,271
Dangerous, huh?

177
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,498
Did you really think I didn’t know?

178
00:12:07,902 --> 00:12:11,569
Damn you! I’ve always known.

179
00:12:27,816 --> 00:12:30,240
(Hello. I’m headed to our meeting spot.)

180
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,326
Almost there myself.

181
00:12:31,425 --> 00:12:32,320
See you.

182
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:32,907
(Okay.)

183
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:12,487
I want you to obtain a search warrant on this drug warehouse that belongs to Tawi.

184
00:13:13,073 --> 00:13:14,128
Seriously?

185
00:13:14,128 --> 00:13:15,235
This is risky.

186
00:13:15,578 --> 00:13:17,677
Tawi has everything under control.

187
00:13:18,845 --> 00:13:19,601
Not everything.

188
00:13:20,797 --> 00:13:22,560
More people are against him now.

189
00:13:22,804 --> 00:13:24,804
But there are people who still follow his orders.

190
00:13:26,162 --> 00:13:27,136
Back then,

191
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:29,505
nobody dared to touch him.

192
00:13:30,212 --> 00:13:31,441
But you see how it is now.

193
00:13:32,613 --> 00:13:35,000
Many people declare themselves to be on the opposite side of him.

194
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,378
His foundation deteriorated.

195
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,971
We just need a little shove to collapse his empire.

196
00:13:52,148 --> 00:13:53,476
Prepare to lit the fire.

197
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,655
It’s my button.

198
00:13:59,748 --> 00:14:00,977
I thought you’d keep it.

199
00:14:01,246 --> 00:14:01,910
Give it back.

200
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:02,923
I don’t want to throw it away anymore.

201
00:14:03,105 --> 00:14:03,819
Wait.

202
00:14:04,167 --> 00:14:05,179
I’ll give it to you later.

203
00:14:28,396 --> 00:14:29,825
Sean, White, get up.

204
00:14:29,825 --> 00:14:31,825
Dan said the photos are with someone in the inner circle now.

205
00:14:32,161 --> 00:14:32,904
Gumpa,

206
00:14:33,494 --> 00:14:34,259
get up.

207
00:14:35,515 --> 00:14:37,097
Gram, wake up.

208
00:14:41,492 --> 00:14:43,050
The photos have been handed to our guy.

209
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:48,183
In a few days, Tawi will learn this from his rats and relocate the drugs before the search takes place.

210
00:14:50,171 --> 00:14:51,286
Get yourselves ready.

211
00:14:51,637 --> 00:14:53,505
They might move the drugs tonight.

212
00:14:53,649 --> 00:14:55,379
You two go to the warehouse.

213
00:14:55,725 --> 00:14:57,505
Yok and I will be nearby.

214
00:14:57,505 --> 00:14:58,738
So we can catch up with them when they make a move.

215
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,200
Time for payback, finally.

216
00:15:39,326 --> 00:15:40,417
It’s my button.

217
00:15:41,034 --> 00:15:42,297
I thought you’d keep it.

218
00:15:50,138 --> 00:15:51,585
Because I needed to get over you,

219
00:15:52,382 --> 00:15:53,522
I left it here.

220
00:15:54,693 --> 00:15:55,223
Give it back.

221
00:15:55,395 --> 00:15:56,585
I don’t want to throw it away anymore.

222
00:15:56,585 --> 00:15:57,240
Wait.

223
00:15:58,288 --> 00:15:59,268
I’ll give it to you later.

224
00:16:14,604 --> 00:16:15,624
Still no movement.

225
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:17,955
No cars in the area.

226
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:23,007
Sean,

227
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:27,163
if you’re through with this mission,

228
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:29,527
what will you do next?

229
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:35,517
Back to wearing a mask

230
00:16:36,849 --> 00:16:38,259
and fight alongside everyone.

231
00:16:39,092 --> 00:16:40,674
It can’t be over that easily.

232
00:16:41,632 --> 00:16:42,944
We need to keep fighting.

233
00:16:43,898 --> 00:16:45,628
We will take turns watching.

234
00:16:46,476 --> 00:16:47,395
You take a rest first.

235
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:54,245
Here.

236
00:18:25,423 --> 00:18:26,095
Sean.

237
00:18:26,242 --> 00:18:27,005
Sean.

238
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:28,221
They’re on the move.

239
00:18:31,514 --> 00:18:32,998
There are three trucks.

240
00:18:32,998 --> 00:18:33,951
Which one should we follow?

241
00:18:34,163 --> 00:18:36,705
We must get to the front of the warehouse now and follow the last truck.

242
00:18:36,828 --> 00:18:37,555
Let’s move.

243
00:19:04,906 --> 00:19:06,169
Hey, what happened?

244
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:56,060
Gram,

245
00:19:56,385 --> 00:19:58,938
how much longer until we reach Tawi’s company headquarter?

246
00:19:58,938 --> 00:20:00,552
I’ll dump these drugs in front of his company.

247
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:02,472
Go straight this way 20 more minutes.

248
00:20:02,472 --> 00:20:03,585
I’ll tell you the direction.

249
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:05,650
Sean,

250
00:20:05,985 --> 00:20:07,326
I know you don’t like Dan.

251
00:20:07,737 --> 00:20:09,614
But what he said makes sense.

252
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:11,308
If people take the drugs,

253
00:20:11,701 --> 00:20:12,705
it’ll be chaotic.

254
00:20:12,805 --> 00:20:14,305
Stop listening to the outsider.

255
00:20:17,454 --> 00:20:18,072
Sean,

256
00:20:18,367 --> 00:20:20,388
there are people protesting in front of his company.

257
00:20:20,546 --> 00:20:21,882
We can’t just park the truck there.

258
00:20:21,882 --> 00:20:23,676
The situation will be out of hand.

259
00:20:24,246 --> 00:20:25,582
We need to think of a new plan.

260
00:20:26,214 --> 00:20:27,182
What should we do, Gram?

261
00:20:28,862 --> 00:20:29,854
I have no clue.

262
00:20:30,617 --> 00:20:32,322
Why do you never think of backup plans?

263
00:20:41,585 --> 00:20:43,438
There must be some crowd control police on the scene.

264
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:45,345
We will park the truck there.

265
00:20:45,687 --> 00:20:47,318
Then we will let the police take it from there.

266
00:20:47,976 --> 00:20:49,878
Thousands of people will be watching.

267
00:20:50,623 --> 00:20:52,033
They won’t dare to do anything dirty.

268
00:20:53,092 --> 00:20:54,576
I think this plan is much better than the first one.

269
00:20:56,862 --> 00:20:59,550
When I speak, you don’t listen. But when White speaks, you fall down at his feet.

270
00:21:10,827 --> 00:21:12,827
Stop being lovebirds when we’re on a mission.

271
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:14,501
It’s distracting.

272
00:21:16,385 --> 00:21:17,396
It’s annoying!

273
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,705
Ignore them.

274
00:21:21,381 --> 00:21:22,496
Just keep hugging me.

275
00:21:22,945 --> 00:21:24,650
Our mission will be over in a few minutes.

276
00:22:59,106 --> 00:23:00,368
You came to kill me?

277
00:23:01,106 --> 00:23:01,746
Yes.

278
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:03,273
What will you get out of it?

279
00:23:04,191 --> 00:23:05,185
Think about it.

280
00:23:05,812 --> 00:23:07,615
Tawi’s power is about to run out.

281
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:11,306
People are gathering to oppose him.

282
00:23:11,924 --> 00:23:14,833
The more people show up, the more difficult it is for him to control.

283
00:23:15,472 --> 00:23:17,275
Everyone is desperate to get their hands on him.

284
00:23:18,218 --> 00:23:19,186
And at that moment,

285
00:23:20,123 --> 00:23:23,745
my men, wearing masks just like you guys do, will kill him.

286
00:23:24,206 --> 00:23:26,452
This way, nobody knows who did it.

287
00:23:26,855 --> 00:23:28,065
They will surely think it’s you.

288
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:29,296
Who would believe you?

289
00:23:29,595 --> 00:23:33,185
It’s hard to believe that people who never used violence would murder Tawi.

290
00:23:33,399 --> 00:23:34,785
Be realistic here.

291
00:23:35,059 --> 00:23:37,870
If you are on my side, I can offer you anything.

292
00:23:37,996 --> 00:23:41,323
Whatever you want, whatever you want to change, I can give you that.

293
00:23:42,406 --> 00:23:43,595
You just need to listen to me.

294
00:23:45,011 --> 00:23:46,785
You have come so far, Black.

295
00:23:46,901 --> 00:23:48,655
You get people to stand with you.

296
00:23:50,099 --> 00:23:51,105
Now what?

297
00:23:52,802 --> 00:23:54,145
You can’t take him down anyway.

298
00:23:54,576 --> 00:23:55,740
Just admit it.

299
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:58,980
You guys don’t have the power to change anything.

300
00:24:00,935 --> 00:24:02,493
Protesting might play a role.

301
00:24:02,847 --> 00:24:06,125
But it isn’t something that changes anything in this country.

302
00:24:07,031 --> 00:24:08,072
Power is.

303
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,268
Without power,

304
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:13,345
this nation can never be changed.

305
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:06,170
Tie him up.

306
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:15,582
Take his gun.

307
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:19,837
Go outside.

308
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:20,887
I’ll take it from here.

309
00:25:33,646 --> 00:25:35,105
You will never win, Black.

310
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,305
Just realize that.

311
00:25:38,734 --> 00:25:42,332
It isn’t just me who wants to fight against this shit.

312
00:25:42,804 --> 00:25:44,112
We won’t surrender.

313
00:25:45,095 --> 00:25:46,205
If you want me to yield,

314
00:25:46,573 --> 00:25:47,425
shoot.

315
00:25:56,704 --> 00:25:57,401
Kill me.

316
00:25:58,287 --> 00:25:59,673
Do it like you did before.

317
00:26:12,731 --> 00:26:13,920
If I really could,

318
00:26:16,854 --> 00:26:18,313
you wouldn't be standing here.

319
00:26:21,843 --> 00:26:23,007
You’re my friend.

320
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:35,351
I have a question for you.

321
00:26:36,949 --> 00:26:38,433
If you could turn back time,

322
00:26:39,634 --> 00:26:41,462
would you kill me and get it over with?

323
00:26:46,461 --> 00:26:48,461
Give me countless chances to turn back time,

324
00:26:49,933 --> 00:26:50,925
my decision would remain the same.

325
00:26:52,526 --> 00:26:54,084
We can’t kill each other, Black.

326
00:26:56,252 --> 00:26:57,908
Our paths may have taken a different turn

327
00:26:59,476 --> 00:27:01,329
but our intentions

328
00:27:03,169 --> 00:27:04,210
are just the same.

329
00:27:09,768 --> 00:27:10,982
Don’t be so confident.

330
00:27:13,605 --> 00:27:15,113
The outcomes might be different.

331
00:27:17,426 --> 00:27:18,369
But you must accept this.

332
00:27:19,595 --> 00:27:21,300
Whether we do it your way or mine,

333
00:27:23,624 --> 00:27:25,157
we need to live on in this cycle.

334
00:27:29,227 --> 00:27:31,585
Should I finish you off right now, Todd?

335
00:27:39,663 --> 00:27:40,418
Go ahead.

336
00:27:43,195 --> 00:27:44,170
If you can.

337
00:27:50,297 --> 00:27:51,585
Shit! There are cops up ahead.

338
00:27:52,943 --> 00:27:56,385
Holy shit! If we get caught, we become drug smugglers.

339
00:27:56,846 --> 00:27:58,010
I think we’ve been betrayed.

340
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:36,915
Shit! There are cops up ahead.

341
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,021
Why is this happening, Yok?

342
00:28:43,134 --> 00:28:45,555
Did you talk to Dan about our route?

343
00:28:45,555 --> 00:28:46,382
I did.

344
00:28:46,749 --> 00:28:49,822
Holy shit! If we get caught, we become drug smugglers.

345
00:28:51,291 --> 00:28:52,454
I think we’ve been betrayed.

346
00:28:53,449 --> 00:28:54,485
What should we do, Sean?

347
00:28:54,699 --> 00:28:59,337
Sean, should we tell them honestly that we took this truck from Tawi’s warehouse?

348
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:01,530
Dan is a policeman. He can help prove our words.

349
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:02,624
I don’t trust them.

350
00:29:03,076 --> 00:29:04,112
What are you going to do then?

351
00:29:04,522 --> 00:29:05,254
Stay put.

352
00:29:05,581 --> 00:29:06,675
Listen to what I say.

353
00:29:20,489 --> 00:29:21,875
[Gumpa, our plan failed.]

354
00:29:38,639 --> 00:29:39,298
Sean?

355
00:29:46,502 --> 00:29:47,079
Sean.

356
00:29:47,188 --> 00:29:48,183
Sean!

357
00:29:48,504 --> 00:29:49,142
Hey!

358
00:29:50,125 --> 00:29:50,706
Hey!

359
00:29:59,529 --> 00:30:02,275
Sean, what you just did makes us criminals.

360
00:30:02,275 --> 00:30:03,789
We will surely get caught if they follow us.

361
00:30:03,789 --> 00:30:04,452
What do we do now?

362
00:30:04,967 --> 00:30:07,240
I’ll call Dan and check what happened.

363
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:07,924
Don’t call him.

364
00:30:08,177 --> 00:30:09,504
Isn’t this obvious?

365
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,078
Something must have happened.

366
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:14,668
Dam you, Yok!

367
00:30:14,668 --> 00:30:15,901
Stop being crazy over a guy!

368
00:30:16,255 --> 00:30:17,673
Sean, what are you going to do?

369
00:30:17,673 --> 00:30:18,173
Gram!

370
00:30:18,678 --> 00:30:19,859
Don’t panic.

371
00:30:20,063 --> 00:30:21,875
I already asked Gumpa for help.

372
00:30:24,689 --> 00:30:25,634
Sean, listen.

373
00:30:25,872 --> 00:30:27,399
We will leave the truck on the street.

374
00:30:27,399 --> 00:30:29,195
We must climb a wall and go across the street.

375
00:30:29,195 --> 00:30:30,609
Gumpa will be waiting for us there.

376
00:30:38,862 --> 00:30:39,825
Pull over.

377
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:45,147
Guys, get out.

378
00:30:52,715 --> 00:30:53,727
Over that wall.

379
00:30:53,727 --> 00:30:54,442
Sean, hurry up.

380
00:30:57,431 --> 00:30:58,030
White, come on.

381
00:31:14,446 --> 00:31:15,518
They’re following us.

382
00:31:15,518 --> 00:31:16,433
Gram, let’s go.

383
00:31:22,682 --> 00:31:23,529
Yok is shot!

384
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:24,973
Yok, come here.

385
00:31:25,181 --> 00:31:26,052
White, lead the way.

386
00:31:26,052 --> 00:31:27,836
You okay, Yok?

387
00:31:27,836 --> 00:31:28,747
Come on.

388
00:31:31,488 --> 00:31:32,251
You all right, Yok?

389
00:31:51,172 --> 00:31:51,953
It hurts.

390
00:31:52,154 --> 00:31:52,918
Can we take a break?

391
00:31:53,282 --> 00:31:54,045
We’re almost there.

392
00:32:00,137 --> 00:32:01,173
Yok, are you okay?

393
00:32:05,029 --> 00:32:05,828
Yok, how are you?

394
00:32:06,125 --> 00:32:07,361
Leave me here.

395
00:32:07,579 --> 00:32:08,687
I’ll find a way to catch up with you guys later.

396
00:32:09,069 --> 00:32:09,797
Are you nuts?

397
00:32:11,145 --> 00:32:14,255
White, try to get Gram and Yok out of here.

398
00:32:14,458 --> 00:32:15,541
I will meet up with you soon.

399
00:32:19,889 --> 00:32:20,533
Sean.

400
00:32:22,458 --> 00:32:23,294
I’ll see you soon.

401
00:32:32,676 --> 00:32:33,512
Come on, White.

402
00:32:41,927 --> 00:32:42,563
Let’s go.

403
00:32:42,924 --> 00:32:43,978
Yok, get up.

404
00:33:21,946 --> 00:33:22,618
Guys, hurry.

405
00:33:25,702 --> 00:33:26,683
Get in the car!

406
00:33:26,998 --> 00:33:27,579
Get in.

407
00:33:43,878 --> 00:33:44,378
Yok.

408
00:33:45,214 --> 00:33:45,810
Yok.

409
00:33:46,264 --> 00:33:46,877
Are you okay?

410
00:33:47,473 --> 00:33:48,208
I am.

411
00:33:48,445 --> 00:33:49,801
White, stop the bleed.

412
00:33:50,563 --> 00:33:53,036
Sean, check if they’re following us.

413
00:33:56,627 --> 00:33:57,194
Yok.

414
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,229
There’s nobody.

415
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:03,836
They might stop following us already.

416
00:34:08,424 --> 00:34:10,133
Gumpa, he’s getting worse.

417
00:34:10,268 --> 00:34:11,486
He won’t stop bleeding.

418
00:34:11,951 --> 00:34:12,603
White,

419
00:34:12,694 --> 00:34:14,406
don’t let him go unconscious.

420
00:34:14,675 --> 00:34:15,694
Try to stay awake, Yok.

421
00:34:15,931 --> 00:34:16,631

422
00:34:16,931 --> 00:34:17,431

Damn it!

427
00:34:27,791 --> 00:34:29,791
Gumpa, I think we should take him to a hospital.

428
00:34:30,678 --> 00:34:32,041
Take me to the safe house.

429
00:34:32,930 --> 00:34:33,930
Don’t think that’s a good idea.

430
00:34:34,148 --> 00:34:34,835
It’s too risky.

431
00:34:35,113 --> 00:34:36,315
Let’s go to a hospital.

432
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:37,986
He has a gunshot wound.

433
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:39,612
The nurse must inform the police.

434
00:34:40,067 --> 00:34:41,235
What should we say?

435
00:34:41,405 --> 00:34:43,405
We can say we had a fight with some teen gangsters.

436
00:34:43,405 --> 00:34:44,464
And they ran away.

437
00:34:44,942 --> 00:34:46,615
It can’t be that simple with a gunshot wound.

438
00:34:46,771 --> 00:34:47,955
We sure will be investigated.

439
00:34:47,955 --> 00:34:49,456

I’m sorry.

447

I was overthinking it.

448

If they want to arrest us, let them.

Yok.

458
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,258
Sean, White, go watch the front of the hospital

459
00:35:25,258 --> 00:35:26,193
in case they followed us here.

460
00:35:26,193 --> 00:35:27,723
I will examine the escape route.

461
00:36:19,134 --> 00:36:19,774
Guys,

462
00:36:21,171 --> 00:36:24,253
the doctor said Yok wasn’t badly injured so they didn’t give him anesthetics.

463
00:36:24,638 --> 00:36:26,304
He should wake up in 3-6 hours.

464
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:27,830
Can’t he wake up sooner?

465
00:36:28,179 --> 00:36:30,179
I am not an expert so I don’t know.

466
00:36:30,415 --> 00:36:31,773
How about you ask the anesthetist?

467
00:36:33,957 --> 00:36:35,613
We will escape immediately after he wakes up.

468
00:36:36,067 --> 00:36:37,542
I will examine the escape route.

469
00:36:37,811 --> 00:36:40,646
Sean, White, go watch the front of the hospital

470
00:36:40,784 --> 00:36:41,693
in case they followed us here.

471
00:36:42,647 --> 00:36:44,647
Gram, look after Yok.

472
00:36:45,672 --> 00:36:46,408

474
00:37:24,927 --> 00:37:27,452
I should have trusted my own gut from the start.

475
00:37:28,193 --> 00:37:29,740
I shouldn’t have listened to that f*cking cop.

476
00:37:30,509 --> 00:37:31,617
Don’t jump to that conclusion yet.

477
00:37:32,285 --> 00:37:33,535
It might not be what you think.

478
00:37:34,472 --> 00:37:35,828
Who else would it be?

479
00:37:40,555 --> 00:37:42,841
If they can track us to this hospital,

480
00:37:43,794 --> 00:37:45,484
that means the cops and Tawi work together.

Yes.

It’s better to let people know everything.

00:39:58,518 --> 00:40:00,279
There is a special force waiting downstairs.

513
00:40:01,147 --> 00:40:02,360
You can’t flee.

514
00:40:06,538 --> 00:40:07,653
Don’t listen to him.

515
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,249
Move.

516
00:40:12,249 --> 00:40:12,907
Freeze!

517
00:40:12,907 --> 00:40:13,555
Let go!

518
00:40:13,602 --> 00:40:14,102
Freeze!

519
00:40:14,102 --> 00:40:14,766
Let me go!

520
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:16,132
I told you not to resist!

521
00:40:25,878 --> 00:40:27,653
Just save your own life first.

522
00:40:36,164 --> 00:40:36,782
Sean,

523
00:40:37,951 --> 00:40:38,713
calm down.

524
00:40:47,513 --> 00:40:48,583
Finally,

525
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:51,137
you get to arrest me for real.

526
00:41:27,654 --> 00:41:28,509
I’m sorry.

527
00:41:32,286 --> 00:41:33,189
Sub-Lieutenant Danai.

528
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:35,742
Please step outside with me.

529
00:41:35,957 --> 00:41:37,155
Sergeant, take him.

530
00:41:37,155 --> 00:41:37,773
This way.

531
00:41:46,932 --> 00:41:47,835
Please, Lieutenant Dan.

532
00:41:48,746 --> 00:41:49,932
Someone would like to have a chat with you.

533
00:41:52,253 --> 00:41:53,067
Please, get in.

534
00:42:07,686 --> 00:42:09,686
I’m sorry I failed you.

535
00:42:10,526 --> 00:42:12,955
The more you try to escape, the more dangerous it is for you.

536
00:42:21,373 --> 00:42:22,514
Believe me.

537
00:42:24,227 --> 00:42:25,750
Enter the justice system.

538
00:42:27,661 --> 00:42:31,736
It’s the best thing I can offer you now.

539
00:42:39,029 --> 00:42:41,363
Do you still believe in the justice system?

540
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:52,516
You said you’d like to redeem yourself and fix what you did wrong.

541
00:43:02,009 --> 00:43:03,699
You didn’t want to be part of the system.

542
00:43:06,257 --> 00:43:07,470
Why are you doing this?

543
00:43:11,441 --> 00:43:12,237
It’s necessary.

544
00:43:12,237 --> 00:43:13,441
Don’t make excuses!

545
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,341
This is really necessary.

546
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:20,930
Otherwise, you all won’t get to stay alive.

547
00:43:59,564 --> 00:44:02,280
Police Sub-Lieutenant Danai Ratchapakdee, sir.

548
00:44:03,903 --> 00:44:05,402
Let’s get down to business.

549
00:44:14,908 --> 00:44:17,791
Our society is now divided into two groups,

550
00:44:18,586 --> 00:44:20,109
people like you and me.

551
00:44:20,708 --> 00:44:23,877
Certain things have their limits and boundaries.

552
00:44:24,792 --> 00:44:29,440
We need to do something to remind you of who you are,

553
00:44:29,963 --> 00:44:31,128
who I am,

554
00:44:32,423 --> 00:44:34,017
who among us is superior.

555
00:44:34,737 --> 00:44:35,997
Do you get what I said?

556
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:39,436
But we are all humans.

557
00:44:49,373 --> 00:44:51,516
We can’t get everything we desire.

558
00:44:51,827 --> 00:44:53,827
You have the right to be angry and express it.

559
00:44:54,197 --> 00:44:57,843
You can paint it on the wall and condemn us.

560
00:44:59,379 --> 00:45:00,806
But not this.

561
00:45:03,442 --> 00:45:05,853
Someone just wants to finish you off.

562
00:45:06,344 --> 00:45:08,654
But I know you’re not a fool.

563
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:12,080
I'm giving you a chance to redress.

564
00:45:13,548 --> 00:45:15,023
Come back to where you’re supposed to be.

565
00:45:15,551 --> 00:45:18,863
If you’re angry, go out there and paint until you feel better.

566
00:45:19,572 --> 00:45:21,119
But if you don’t listen to me,

567
00:45:21,871 --> 00:45:24,873
I might need to send someone to talk to your parents instead.

568
00:45:25,588 --> 00:45:28,065
Maybe they can change your mind.

569
00:45:52,171 --> 00:45:54,493
(However, at that moment I sympathize with Dan.)

570
00:45:54,891 --> 00:45:58,251
(Since it's not like everyone can stand up against this oppressive system.)

571
00:46:29,555 --> 00:46:30,270
Go now.

572
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:31,453
This is all I can do for you.

573
00:46:31,698 --> 00:46:32,410
Come on, Gumpa.

574
00:46:37,099 --> 00:46:37,906
Get in, Gram.

575
00:46:39,057 --> 00:46:40,341
Do you remember what you told me?

576
00:46:41,341 --> 00:46:44,343
You told me not to look for you if I wanted no regrets.

577
00:46:46,609 --> 00:46:47,965
I should have believed you then.

578
00:46:50,024 --> 00:46:50,844
Please go.

579
00:46:50,844 --> 00:46:51,404
Move!

580
00:46:52,049 --> 00:46:52,761
Now.

581
00:47:11,877 --> 00:47:13,877
Directed by Anucha Boonyawatana

582
00:47:15,237 --> 00:47:17,237
We will go down to the 6th floor and use the fire exit.

583
00:47:18,653 --> 00:47:20,653
You take Yok to the 2nd floor.

584
00:47:20,653 --> 00:47:21,903
I think there are police on the first floor.

585
00:47:21,903 --> 00:47:24,352
I will lure the police out front away.

586
00:47:24,709 --> 00:47:26,709
Sean, take care of my brother.

587
00:47:30,532 --> 00:47:31,292
Freeze!

588
00:47:31,993 --> 00:47:32,872
Put down your weapon.

589
00:47:36,518 --> 00:47:38,828
My job is to make you all vanish.
