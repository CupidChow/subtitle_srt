Viewer discretion is advised.

5
00:00:18,874 --> 00:00:20,289
It’s not like when we burned his house.

6
00:00:20,476 --> 00:00:22,687
His business unit is full of his employees.

7
00:00:22,687 --> 00:00:24,481
So I asked Gumpa to train us exclusively.

8
00:00:24,624 --> 00:00:25,600
Prepare to jump.

9
00:00:27,471 --> 00:00:28,640
Black is acting really weird.

10
00:00:28,804 --> 00:00:30,804
You’ve been taking extra interest in him.

11
00:00:31,409 --> 00:00:34,508
I’m not sure if Gram is someone who hurt Black

12
00:00:35,278 --> 00:00:36,717
or actually loves Black.

13
00:00:36,961 --> 00:00:37,557
(Ouch!)

14
00:00:38,187 --> 00:00:39,040
Sean.

15
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:40,200
Sean!

16
00:00:41,246 --> 00:00:42,132
Sean!

17
00:00:45,725 --> 00:00:46,465
Let me go.

18
00:01:00,335 --> 00:01:01,446
You haven’t used that?

19
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,590
I’ll try it now.

20
00:01:07,588 --> 00:01:08,465
Who is this?

21
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:09,637
Black

22
00:01:09,754 --> 00:01:10,674
it’s me.

23
00:01:10,674 --> 00:01:11,493
Sean?

24
00:01:11,966 --> 00:01:12,867
Don’t move.

25
00:01:19,857 --> 00:01:20,519
Black,

26
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:22,652
get closer slowly

27
00:01:23,223 --> 00:01:24,498
and untie me.

28
00:01:30,876 --> 00:01:31,753
Quickly.

29
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,280
Black, faster.

30
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:40,627
What are you up to?

31
00:01:51,013 --> 00:01:52,662
Move one more inch,

32
00:01:53,632 --> 00:01:55,000
and I’ll blow your head off.

33
00:01:55,308 --> 00:01:58,431
Who else is in your gang?

34
00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:00,386
Say it.

35
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,160
I told you to talk.

36
00:02:07,605 --> 00:02:10,564
I know you guys are sneaking into the manufacturer.

37
00:02:11,271 --> 00:02:14,066
And we know it’s not just the two of you.

38
00:02:15,586 --> 00:02:16,814
I’m giving you a chance to speak

39
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,866
before you won’t get to speak at all.

40
00:02:19,866 --> 00:02:20,776
Don’t hurt my friend.

41
00:02:20,862 --> 00:02:22,230
- I’ll just hurt you then.
- Don’t!

42
00:02:24,058 --> 00:02:25,894
If you don’t want your friend to die,

43
00:02:26,421 --> 00:02:28,140
say it before I count to three.

44
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,263
One.

45
00:02:38,765 --> 00:02:39,876
Two.

46
00:02:44,418 --> 00:02:45,693
There are three more.

47
00:02:48,288 --> 00:02:49,212
What did you say?

48
00:02:50,856 --> 00:02:52,692
Yok, Gram, and Gumpa, the garage owner.

49
00:02:53,696 --> 00:02:55,360
Shit!

50
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:58,567
Black, you asshole!

51
00:03:03,043 --> 00:03:04,505
How did you sell out your friends like that?

52
00:03:05,206 --> 00:03:06,340
Why did you do it?

53
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:08,960
Thanks, guys.

54
00:03:13,923 --> 00:03:15,245
Why did you do that?

55
00:03:17,584 --> 00:03:19,256
So you all just deceived me?

56
00:03:19,953 --> 00:03:20,807
We didn’t deceive you.

57
00:03:21,139 --> 00:03:22,400
We just tested you.

58
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,699
For what shit?

59
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:25,642
To prove you don't fit for the mission.

60
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:27,360
You're going to get us killed.

61
00:03:27,451 --> 00:03:28,468
Do you realize that?

62
00:03:28,534 --> 00:03:30,160
I told them just to help you.

63
00:03:30,691 --> 00:03:32,691
Your life is worth more than you think.

64
00:04:49,021 --> 00:04:50,881
Drink up and cool yourself down.

65
00:04:56,537 --> 00:04:58,116
Did you really need to do all that?

66
00:04:58,963 --> 00:05:00,963
Sean asked me to come up with the test.

67
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,580
The rest, you can just ask him.

68
00:05:09,317 --> 00:05:12,800
You’re aware that sneaking into the manufacturer is dangerous.

69
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,281
What do you think will happen if we get caught and our identities are exposed?

70
00:05:15,841 --> 00:05:17,163
It’s better than you all die,

71
00:05:18,066 --> 00:05:20,066
die with no one knowing who you are.

72
00:05:22,678 --> 00:05:25,497
When you were at my house, why were you being skeptical?

73
00:05:26,448 --> 00:05:27,863
What exactly is your standpoint?

74
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:34,754
I just wanted to make sure what we’re doing is right in people’s eyes,

75
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:36,460
and that we’re not doing it pointlessly.

76
00:05:36,716 --> 00:05:39,394
People might think we attack him just because we hate him.

77
00:05:39,681 --> 00:05:43,178
We can never earn people’s support

78
00:05:43,472 --> 00:05:44,864
if we don’t have clear principles.

79
00:05:48,299 --> 00:05:49,784
Black is starting to make sense.

80
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,495
If all we do is crash,

81
00:05:51,881 --> 00:05:54,559
the outcome might be more and more disastrous.

82
00:05:55,766 --> 00:05:57,438
I want Black back in.

83
00:05:59,002 --> 00:06:00,160
What you said is not wrong.

84
00:06:00,432 --> 00:06:01,156
Not wrong,

85
00:06:02,022 --> 00:06:02,924
but not right either.

86
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:05,786
I appreciated your help

87
00:06:06,544 --> 00:06:08,146
but this job is risky.

88
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:12,880
You can’t hold back if anyone gets caught.

89
00:06:14,881 --> 00:06:16,132
What’s your plan?

90
00:06:16,281 --> 00:06:17,369
What was the test for?

91
00:06:18,034 --> 00:06:20,034
We will sneak into his beverage manufacturer

92
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:22,074
and add a substance to the product.

93
00:06:22,074 --> 00:06:22,672
What?

94
00:06:22,785 --> 00:06:23,990
Isn’t it dangerous?

95
00:06:24,235 --> 00:06:25,463
Wait until I finish.

96
00:06:26,324 --> 00:06:30,570
What we’re adding is bitterant which will only make the product taste bitter.

97
00:06:30,926 --> 00:06:32,131
It isn’t unhealthy.

98
00:06:32,604 --> 00:06:35,446
When people drink his foul-tasting beverage,

99
00:06:35,702 --> 00:06:38,123
they will boycott it.

100
00:06:38,494 --> 00:06:40,962
Why didn’t you consult with me when you plotted this?

101
00:06:41,274 --> 00:06:42,596
You gave me the shot.

102
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:46,239
And I tested you because this is my plan.

103
00:06:46,905 --> 00:06:47,946
I don’t want any failure.

104
00:06:49,119 --> 00:06:50,183
But we’re the ones doing it.

105
00:06:50,371 --> 00:06:52,207
Society must be questioning our action.

106
00:06:53,471 --> 00:06:56,243
I don’t care what people think of us.

107
00:06:57,074 --> 00:07:00,000
Then we’re no different than those we hate.

108
00:07:00,643 --> 00:07:02,175
What is your boundary, Sean?

109
00:07:03,369 --> 00:07:06,702
Someone like you is teaching me about boundaries?

110
00:07:08,432 --> 00:07:10,000
Let me tell you this.

111
00:07:10,593 --> 00:07:13,412
If I can trade my life for his death,

112
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,484
I will.

113
00:07:45,237 --> 00:07:46,699
I want to talk things out.

114
00:07:47,396 --> 00:07:49,256
What the heck?

115
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,127
You don’t seem like the same person.

116
00:08:01,418 --> 00:08:02,810
The Black that I used to know.

117
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:08,399
Time changes and people change too.

118
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,622
I used to have different thoughts before

119
00:08:10,832 --> 00:08:13,838
but I’m seeing a bigger picture now.

120
00:08:15,091 --> 00:08:16,693
I can’t go back to who I was anymore.

121
00:08:19,051 --> 00:08:21,753
Your eyes are opened, right?

122
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,701
Think whatever you want.

123
00:08:26,346 --> 00:08:29,586
Just don’t kick me out because I don’t think like you.

124
00:08:31,838 --> 00:08:35,242
I didn’t do that because I wanted to kick you out.

125
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:39,837
I just wanted to make sure you’re still the same.

126
00:08:40,155 --> 00:08:40,985
That’s all.

127
00:08:41,653 --> 00:08:43,115
Listen to me, Sean.

128
00:08:44,203 --> 00:08:46,881
I was berserk back then

129
00:08:47,481 --> 00:08:48,543
but now

130
00:08:49,596 --> 00:08:51,633
I’m more concerned about our lives.

131
00:08:53,043 --> 00:08:55,815
If we’re alive and walk together,

132
00:08:56,185 --> 00:08:57,694
we can go further.

133
00:09:01,885 --> 00:09:08,377
Since when did you think your life is more important than your ideology?

134
00:09:09,328 --> 00:09:11,936
Tell me what changed you.

135
00:09:13,926 --> 00:09:15,271
Is it…

136
00:09:18,011 --> 00:09:20,011
that moment when you almost died?

137
00:09:22,217 --> 00:09:27,515
Are you sure dying for what you believe is the right thing?

138
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:31,082
I’ll give you a clear example.

139
00:09:31,563 --> 00:09:34,709
You cross the street in a crosswalk without looking right or left

140
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,220
because you’re sure it’s the right thing.

141
00:09:37,508 --> 00:09:39,508
You don’t care if the approaching car is going to stop or not.

142
00:09:39,692 --> 00:09:41,692
It hits you to death.

143
00:09:42,101 --> 00:09:44,616
Can your life even prove anything?

144
00:09:45,254 --> 00:09:50,389
Who would know that you did it to prove what’s right,

145
00:09:50,572 --> 00:09:53,391
that the car must stop to let people cross, as the law says?

146
00:09:53,921 --> 00:09:56,800
People will just say you’re dumb not to look before you cross it.

147
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,125
So you’re going to let those jerks continue what they're doing?

148
00:09:59,421 --> 00:10:01,093
Our society has become accustomed to it.

149
00:10:03,498 --> 00:10:07,486
Although the crosswalk case is small, it signifies a variety of things;

150
00:10:08,034 --> 00:10:09,449
the laws that are too weak,

151
00:10:09,787 --> 00:10:11,576
poor law enforcement, .

152
00:10:11,576 --> 00:10:12,921
street design,

153
00:10:12,921 --> 00:10:14,067
common sense,

154
00:10:14,067 --> 00:10:15,157
and traffic discipline

155
00:10:15,856 --> 00:10:20,149
How many people do you think will care about your death and see the real problem?

156
00:10:20,645 --> 00:10:25,140
Do you realize now that death won’t do you any good?

157
00:10:25,701 --> 00:10:26,882
You don’t get it.

158
00:10:27,174 --> 00:10:29,174
You don’t know how much this means to me.

159
00:10:29,933 --> 00:10:31,629
I’ve been waiting for so long.

160
00:10:32,059 --> 00:10:34,240
Whatever it takes, I’m willing to do it.

161
00:10:34,319 --> 00:10:36,997
I’m not stopping you from taking revenge on Tawi.

162
00:10:37,205 --> 00:10:39,813
All I ask is that you be more careful.

163
00:10:46,481 --> 00:10:48,000
That isn’t your job.

164
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:50,914
Just focus on my plan.

165
00:10:56,511 --> 00:10:57,552
Are you even listening to me?

166
00:10:57,857 --> 00:10:58,639
Sean,

167
00:10:59,154 --> 00:11:00,980
have you been listening to what I’ve said?

168
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,108
I’m listening.

169
00:11:02,376 --> 00:11:03,417
Stay put.

170
00:11:03,417 --> 00:11:04,802
I am.

171
00:11:05,737 --> 00:11:07,386
Don’t play with my hair.

172
00:11:08,197 --> 00:11:09,893
Let go.

173
00:11:10,161 --> 00:11:12,161
I am listening.

174
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:16,793
You’re damn heavy.

175
00:12:19,732 --> 00:12:22,720
This thing is too damn bitter.

176
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,888
Don’t you think it’s too much?

177
00:12:24,137 --> 00:12:26,511
This plan is going to get people to hate us.

178
00:12:26,511 --> 00:12:28,328
It’s not like everyone agrees with us.

179
00:12:59,049 --> 00:12:59,807
Mom.

180
00:13:02,963 --> 00:13:05,753
This is an extrajudicial execution case.

181
00:13:05,753 --> 00:13:11,673
An autopsy is usually performed by forensic and police officers who are working on the case.

182
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:15,427
I'll do everything I can to assist you.

183
00:13:16,011 --> 00:13:19,403
The way I see it, the police used excessive force.

184
00:13:23,513 --> 00:13:31,144
However, it appeared that your spouse was clearly involved with the drugs.

185
00:13:34,553 --> 00:13:35,846
I don’t believe it.

186
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,040
He would never do it.

187
00:13:39,853 --> 00:13:45,150
If you wish to fight the drug case, you have a little chance of succeeding.

188
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:50,423
I suggest you fight the case I mentioned earlier.

189
00:14:00,543 --> 00:14:01,365
Who shot my father?

190
00:14:01,669 --> 00:14:03,033
Stop asking questions.

191
00:14:03,204 --> 00:14:04,412
You’re on his side, right?

192
00:14:04,412 --> 00:14:05,507
- You’re helping him cover it up.
- Stop that.

193
00:14:05,507 --> 00:14:07,372
- Who killed my father?
- Let go of him.

194
00:14:07,372 --> 00:14:10,253
Tell me who killed him!

195
00:14:11,539 --> 00:14:12,444
Answer me!

196
00:14:12,697 --> 00:14:14,055
Who killed my father?

197
00:14:14,557 --> 00:14:15,701
Enough.

198
00:14:23,544 --> 00:14:24,553
Who killed him?

199
00:14:27,205 --> 00:14:27,985
Sean.

200
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:36,785
Are you sick?

201
00:14:38,155 --> 00:14:38,913
Sean.

202
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:18,726
What are you doing?

203
00:15:20,612 --> 00:15:22,612
Why did you put your arm under my neck?

204
00:15:22,783 --> 00:15:24,553
You’re the one that pulled my arm close.

205
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:26,482
Me pulling your arm?

206
00:15:27,981 --> 00:15:29,981
I stuck it out just to support your neck, I guess.

207
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:37,002
What are you doing?

208
00:15:37,596 --> 00:15:38,277
What is it?

209
00:15:38,769 --> 00:15:40,088
Do you lack calcium?

210
00:15:41,226 --> 00:15:42,776
My arm is numb because of you.

211
00:15:49,196 --> 00:15:50,853
So what did I do exactly last night?

212
00:15:53,321 --> 00:15:55,235
You were dreaming.

213
00:15:55,634 --> 00:15:56,906
I tried to wake you but failed.

214
00:15:57,868 --> 00:15:58,840
You hugged me very tight.

215
00:16:06,626 --> 00:16:08,947
Aren’t you going to ask what I dreamt about?

216
00:16:09,696 --> 00:16:10,326
No.

217
00:16:11,397 --> 00:16:13,012
If you wanted to tell, you’d have done it already.

218
00:16:16,441 --> 00:16:17,906
If I dream again next time,

219
00:16:18,129 --> 00:16:19,808
kick me to wake me up.

220
00:16:20,042 --> 00:16:22,213
So your arm won’t get under my neck again.

221
00:16:23,555 --> 00:16:24,720
Sure.

222
00:16:29,107 --> 00:16:31,728
Go get ready.

223
00:16:33,505 --> 00:16:34,553
Get ready for what?

224
00:16:36,135 --> 00:16:37,450
We have the mission tonight.

225
00:16:41,907 --> 00:16:42,622
Get up.

226
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,380
What the heck?

227
00:16:50,847 --> 00:16:51,433
Hey!

228
00:16:51,669 --> 00:16:52,612
Get up!

229
00:17:00,034 --> 00:17:01,117
This is Techit,

230
00:17:01,417 --> 00:17:02,655
Tawi’s right-hand man.

231
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:05,444
He always cleans up after Tawi.

232
00:17:05,615 --> 00:17:06,694
We can’t underestimate him.

233
00:17:06,694 --> 00:17:07,795
He can do anything.

234
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:09,094
If he sees us,

235
00:17:09,553 --> 00:17:10,691
we’re finished.

236
00:17:11,471 --> 00:17:12,615
Remember his face.

237
00:17:18,056 --> 00:17:20,399
The manufacturer consists of two units.

238
00:17:20,634 --> 00:17:22,270
The warehouse is the first.

239
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,134
The production unit is the second.

240
00:17:24,441 --> 00:17:25,606
Yok and Gram,

241
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:30,873
you two get into the warehouse.

242
00:17:30,964 --> 00:17:31,960
You’ll get in from here,

243
00:17:32,063 --> 00:17:33,082
through the garden,

244
00:17:33,425 --> 00:17:34,706
then the grease trap.

245
00:17:34,861 --> 00:17:35,993
Enter from the backdoor.

246
00:17:36,292 --> 00:17:39,353
Do whatever you want to distract them.

247
00:17:39,423 --> 00:17:42,879
Bring in all of the security guards and staff.

248
00:17:47,893 --> 00:17:49,893
Black and I will go to the production unit.

249
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,673
I get into the monitor room.

250
00:17:51,728 --> 00:17:55,398
Black, take this bitterant with you, go to the last belt here.

251
00:17:55,798 --> 00:17:58,269
His most famous drink is produced here.

252
00:17:58,269 --> 00:18:02,401
You will follow the pipe, and you’ll see the mixing tank.

253
00:18:02,401 --> 00:18:06,097
Pour all the bitterant into this tank.

254
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,334
Give me the substance.

255
00:18:15,086 --> 00:18:16,444
Do you get what I said?

256
00:18:17,426 --> 00:18:18,377
I do.

257
00:18:18,623 --> 00:18:21,244
But do we really need to add this thing into the tank?

258
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,221
Just do it and get out of there.

259
00:18:24,221 --> 00:18:26,652
Are you sure this substance isn’t toxic?

260
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:29,910
You taste it.

261
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:33,560
You don’t even want to taste it.

262
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,381
How can we be sure it’s not dangerous?

263
00:18:46,314 --> 00:18:47,222
It gives no scent.

264
00:18:47,222 --> 00:18:48,066
Gram, you try it.

265
00:18:49,401 --> 00:18:50,161
No.

266
00:18:50,332 --> 00:18:51,208
I don’t eat vegetables.

267
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:52,369
What does it have to do with vegetables?

268
00:18:52,593 --> 00:18:54,101
I don’t eat anything bitter.

269
00:18:54,715 --> 00:18:57,113
If you want to know, you taste it.

270
00:19:04,328 --> 00:19:05,129
Are you sure?

271
00:19:05,261 --> 00:19:06,169
I am.

272
00:19:06,442 --> 00:19:07,833
I did the research.

273
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:10,108
You did the research but refused to eat it.

274
00:19:20,699 --> 00:19:21,843
It’s f*cking bitter.

275
00:19:22,212 --> 00:19:23,548
Of course, it is.

276
00:19:23,548 --> 00:19:24,946
You ate it alone without anything else.

277
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,353
My tongue can still taste the bitterness.

278
00:19:31,353 --> 00:19:32,291
Do you have any other symptoms?

279
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:33,185
No.

280
00:19:33,357 --> 00:19:34,217
You’re still alive.

281
00:19:34,217 --> 00:19:35,250
But it’s bitter.

282
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,377
Open your mouth.

283
00:19:41,876 --> 00:19:42,611
Why?

284
00:19:43,133 --> 00:19:44,553
I said open your mouth.

285
00:19:46,592 --> 00:19:49,106
Chew it. You’ll get the sweetness. The bitterness will be gone.

286
00:19:58,553 --> 00:20:00,125
When we get to the production unit,

287
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:02,125
Black and I will take care of this bitterant business.

288
00:20:02,498 --> 00:20:03,727
Get your stuff.

289
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:08,153
Guys,

290
00:20:08,386 --> 00:20:10,873
but this thing is too damn bitter.

291
00:20:10,873 --> 00:20:12,035
Don’t you think it’s too much?

292
00:20:12,562 --> 00:20:14,990
It’s the best way.

293
00:20:15,699 --> 00:20:18,513
And don’t you dare ruin the plan.

294
00:20:18,847 --> 00:20:19,669
Got it?

295
00:20:21,211 --> 00:20:22,612
Think it through.

296
00:20:22,975 --> 00:20:24,975
Even I can’t take it.

297
00:20:24,975 --> 00:20:27,969
What will the customers be after they drink it?

298
00:20:28,157 --> 00:20:30,393
This plan is going to get people to hate us.

299
00:20:30,937 --> 00:20:33,087
Every time we do something, we get condemned.

300
00:20:33,383 --> 00:20:35,383
It’s not like everyone agrees with us.

301
00:20:36,461 --> 00:20:37,102
Come on.

302
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:40,152
People who buy the drink get directly impacted.

303
00:20:40,152 --> 00:20:42,660
It affects them more than the news they watch.

304
00:20:46,784 --> 00:20:47,887
If you’re that scared,

305
00:20:48,508 --> 00:20:49,553
just stay.

306
00:20:52,326 --> 00:20:53,662
Stop saying that to me.

307
00:20:54,483 --> 00:20:55,384
I’m not scared.

308
00:20:55,512 --> 00:20:56,611
I want this plan to work.

309
00:20:57,034 --> 00:20:58,220
Then give me your word.

310
00:20:58,696 --> 00:21:00,696
You will not do anything that jeopardizes the plan again.

311
00:21:02,233 --> 00:21:03,291
Promise me.

312
00:21:07,803 --> 00:21:08,583
Yeah.

313
00:21:16,269 --> 00:21:16,969
We’re ready.

314
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:17,733
Let’s go.

315
00:21:24,218 --> 00:21:25,169
Stop right here.

316
00:21:31,072 --> 00:21:32,644
Go one by one. You first.

317
00:21:33,379 --> 00:21:34,116
Come on.

318
00:21:37,043 --> 00:21:37,887
Be careful.

319
00:22:18,347 --> 00:22:19,705
Do you see these wooden pallets?

320
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:22,890
Up ahead is where Tawi uses to distribute his products.

321
00:22:22,989 --> 00:22:24,553
You wait here.

322
00:22:24,948 --> 00:22:26,327
At 5 a.m.,

323
00:22:26,694 --> 00:22:28,416
his employees will switch their shifts.

324
00:22:28,678 --> 00:22:31,577
When the alarm goes off, you get inside and make a mess.

325
00:22:31,577 --> 00:22:33,068
Try your best to get people’s attention.

326
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,742
Black and I will be in his production unit.

327
00:22:36,861 --> 00:22:37,769
Got it?

328
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,193
Black, come.

329
00:22:53,486 --> 00:22:55,293
Did you really need to do that?

330
00:22:55,478 --> 00:22:59,276
You said you wouldn't get anyone else in trouble, except Tawi.

331
00:22:59,437 --> 00:23:00,302
What is this?

332
00:23:01,054 --> 00:23:03,054
I do whatever needs to be done

333
00:23:29,161 --> 00:23:31,161
How about your wear gloves?

334
00:23:31,448 --> 00:23:33,699
You’re leaving your fingerprints everywhere.
You might get caught.

335
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:34,918
What are you afraid of?

336
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:36,737
No one in our group has a criminal record.

337
00:23:36,934 --> 00:23:39,617
Fingerprint analysis isn’t that easy to conduct.

338
00:23:39,763 --> 00:23:41,398
Stop questioning my plan.

339
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:43,524
Let’s go.

340
00:24:12,469 --> 00:24:14,035
This is the entrance of the research department.

341
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,983
It’s connected to the product department.

342
00:24:16,518 --> 00:24:19,137
You go that way and see whether anyone is still working.

343
00:24:19,251 --> 00:24:20,122
I’ll look this way.

344
00:24:21,584 --> 00:24:23,652
It’s very dark. I don’t think anyone is here.

345
00:24:23,968 --> 00:24:25,169
Go check carefully.

346
00:24:25,837 --> 00:24:27,198
I don’t want any failure.

347
00:24:27,198 --> 00:24:27,954
Move.

348
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:40,077
What are you doing here?

349
00:25:45,213 --> 00:25:48,171
Mr. Techit asked me to get the research on the latest drink.

350
00:25:49,135 --> 00:25:51,820
I wasn’t informed about this at all.

351
00:25:53,005 --> 00:25:54,868
Mr. Techit said it was urgent.

352
00:25:54,868 --> 00:25:55,853
He needs it by tomorrow.

353
00:25:58,294 --> 00:26:01,321
Do you want me to open the QC unit?

354
00:26:03,072 --> 00:26:04,091
That’s okay.

355
00:26:04,731 --> 00:26:05,716
I already looked at the file.

356
00:26:08,773 --> 00:26:09,788
Don’t!

357
00:26:23,595 --> 00:26:25,321
Help me drag him inside.

358
00:26:26,768 --> 00:26:28,061
You went too far.

359
00:26:28,832 --> 00:26:30,337
I talked my way out of it.

360
00:26:30,492 --> 00:26:31,693
Why did you reveal your face?

361
00:26:32,203 --> 00:26:34,956
If he can recognize you, we’ll all be screwed.

362
00:26:38,231 --> 00:26:42,125
You said you wouldn't get anyone else in trouble, except Tawi.

363
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:43,297
What is this?

364
00:26:43,413 --> 00:26:45,504
He won’t die. He’ll wake up soon.

365
00:26:46,269 --> 00:26:48,269
I do whatever needs to be done

366
00:26:49,415 --> 00:26:50,867
to make my plan work.

367
00:26:51,956 --> 00:26:52,937
Now help me.

368
00:27:15,887 --> 00:27:16,897
Get something to tie his arms.

369
00:27:21,392 --> 00:27:22,656
What’s your limit?

370
00:27:25,801 --> 00:27:26,817
You said it was necessary.

371
00:27:27,132 --> 00:27:28,858
But he doesn’t have anything to do with it.

372
00:27:30,623 --> 00:27:33,217
Shut up if you don’t want to get caught.

373
00:27:35,776 --> 00:27:36,822
Get me something to cover his mouth.

374
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:41,564
You tie his legs.

375
00:27:53,802 --> 00:27:55,802
Sean, you should wear a gown.

376
00:27:55,802 --> 00:27:57,368
This way you won’t have to hurt anyone.

377
00:27:57,368 --> 00:27:58,831
If we meet anyone else, I’ll talk to them.

378
00:27:59,014 --> 00:28:00,512
Why are you so problematic?

379
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:03,056
Or you don’t get to lead this time.

380
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:04,240
That’s why you’re being troublesome.

381
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:09,924
What you’re doing to them is also wrong.

382
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:17,009
If you don’t want to do it, fine.

383
00:28:18,505 --> 00:28:19,980
Just don’t get in my way.

384
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:24,645
Cover your mouth.

385
00:28:54,646 --> 00:28:56,349
Hey, come on.

386
00:29:11,638 --> 00:29:13,273
You did all this too?

387
00:29:14,712 --> 00:29:15,662
That’s enough.

388
00:29:22,508 --> 00:29:24,097
Can’t you just give me a little encouragement?

389
00:29:27,897 --> 00:29:30,650
Do you think I’m enjoying it?

390
00:29:32,268 --> 00:29:33,606
Do you think I’m not scared?

391
00:29:46,886 --> 00:29:47,937
I am sorry.

392
00:29:52,602 --> 00:29:53,758
I said all that

393
00:29:54,485 --> 00:29:56,485
because I wanted you to get what you desire.

394
00:29:57,686 --> 00:29:59,481
People stand with you, not oppose you.

395
00:30:02,378 --> 00:30:03,283
Whatever.

396
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:07,200
Just add that thing into the tank. That’s all.

397
00:30:08,055 --> 00:30:10,055
And take off this damn gown.

398
00:30:14,466 --> 00:30:15,850
Don’t ever ruin the plan again.

399
00:30:26,217 --> 00:30:27,396
Sit here for now.

400
00:30:28,767 --> 00:30:30,767
We’ll act again at 5.

401
00:30:46,025 --> 00:30:47,060
It’s nothing yet.

402
00:30:48,543 --> 00:30:49,508
What time is it, Gram?

403
00:30:51,484 --> 00:30:52,389
Wait a little longer.

404
00:30:54,391 --> 00:30:55,138
Yok,

405
00:30:55,412 --> 00:30:56,665
do you think our plan will work?

406
00:30:57,495 --> 00:30:58,491
It will.

407
00:30:58,967 --> 00:31:00,214
We’re prepared.

408
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,343
But all we have is smoke bombs.

409
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:05,202
What if we couldn't cause enough confusion and those two got caught?

410
00:31:05,254 --> 00:31:06,227
What would we do?

411
00:31:06,755 --> 00:31:07,842
I have handheld fireworks too.

412
00:31:08,478 --> 00:31:09,953
I think we can cause some chaos.

413
00:31:10,367 --> 00:31:11,295
Fireworks?

414
00:31:12,271 --> 00:31:14,841
If we cause too much chaos and they all come here, then we can’t flee.

415
00:31:16,097 --> 00:31:16,853
Gram,

416
00:31:17,127 --> 00:31:18,143
just relax.

417
00:31:18,805 --> 00:31:19,937
Stop stressing me out.

418
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,821
I'm just giving the worst-case scenario.

419
00:31:22,137 --> 00:31:23,777
We should have a backup plan.

420
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:25,177
It doesn’t happen yet.

421
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:26,877
Don’t overthink it.

422
00:31:28,116 --> 00:31:28,911
(Gram and Yok.)

423
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:30,801
(Can you hear me?)

424
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,782
(Gram and Yok.)

425
00:31:33,649 --> 00:31:34,411
(Gram and Yok.)

426
00:31:34,411 --> 00:31:35,123
What’s up?

427
00:31:35,601 --> 00:31:36,460
How is it going over there?

428
00:31:37,938 --> 00:31:39,297
We’re in the control room.

429
00:31:39,297 --> 00:31:41,365
They will switch shifts in 20 minutes.

430
00:31:41,365 --> 00:31:42,684
Their alarm will go off.

431
00:31:42,938 --> 00:31:44,619
You can get in then.

432
00:31:45,431 --> 00:31:45,952
Okay.

433
00:31:45,952 --> 00:31:46,815
We’re ready.

434
00:31:48,908 --> 00:31:49,714
See?

435
00:31:50,193 --> 00:31:51,524
I told you not to worry.

436
00:32:15,276 --> 00:32:15,937
Gram,

437
00:32:19,068 --> 00:32:20,087
can I ask you something?

438
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,275
Have you ever looked into someone’s eyes

439
00:32:28,943 --> 00:32:30,509
and knew that person was so different than others?

440
00:32:32,695 --> 00:32:33,623
What’s got into you now?

441
00:32:42,182 --> 00:32:43,777
It doesn’t work with your eyes.

442
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:47,629
Of course, it doesn’t.

443
00:32:49,837 --> 00:32:51,016
You’re a sucker for love.

444
00:32:53,212 --> 00:32:54,961
You’ve never been one. You don’t know.

445
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:05,229
How do you know that?

446
00:33:07,207 --> 00:33:08,865
You’re always with Black.

447
00:33:09,065 --> 00:33:10,403
You can’t have time for anyone else.

448
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,259
I’m not in a relationship,

449
00:33:17,172 --> 00:33:18,627
but I do know that feeling.

450
00:33:20,324 --> 00:33:22,689
The first time our eyes locked, I fell right away.

451
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:25,302
That one is more than a friend to me.

452
00:33:26,896 --> 00:33:28,440
The closer we are, the stronger my feeling is.

453
00:33:35,482 --> 00:33:38,418
I’m afraid it’s just one-sided love, so I keep it within.

454
00:33:40,795 --> 00:33:42,407
I’m scared things will change.

455
00:33:43,681 --> 00:33:45,133
You said I was a sucker for love.

456
00:33:45,541 --> 00:33:47,085
You’re even worse, you know that?

457
00:33:49,021 --> 00:33:50,565
Who is it? Someone I know?

458
00:33:52,487 --> 00:33:53,382
No.

459
00:33:59,246 --> 00:34:00,191
It’s weird.

460
00:34:01,598 --> 00:34:03,598
For someone I’d never met before,

461
00:34:05,025 --> 00:34:07,025
in a few seconds when our eyes connected,

462
00:34:09,248 --> 00:34:11,933
that person drew me in more than anyone I have ever met.

463
00:34:15,017 --> 00:34:15,711
Weird, huh?

464
00:34:16,257 --> 00:34:18,088
You have a cheesy side too.

465
00:34:22,782 --> 00:34:23,961
Only for the right one.

466
00:34:35,468 --> 00:34:36,365
You ready?

467
00:34:38,578 --> 00:34:39,886
Let’s wait until they’re all gone.

468
00:34:43,499 --> 00:34:44,313
Come on.

469
00:34:52,004 --> 00:34:54,483
It’s time to put the bitterant in the tank.

470
00:34:55,763 --> 00:34:56,897
What are you waiting for?

471
00:34:57,234 --> 00:34:57,975
Black,

472
00:34:58,294 --> 00:34:59,553
add it now.

473
00:35:23,393 --> 00:35:24,096
Come on.

474
00:35:43,603 --> 00:35:44,328
Black,

475
00:35:45,813 --> 00:35:48,301
it’s time to put the bitterant in the tank.

476
00:36:26,941 --> 00:36:28,585
Walk down the spiral staircase.

477
00:36:29,141 --> 00:36:30,723
The production line is on your left.

478
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,161
Get to the innermost

479
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,386
and pour that substance into the tank

480
00:36:34,765 --> 00:36:38,062
After that, I’ll erase all the CCTV footage.

481
00:36:39,095 --> 00:36:40,168
Get going.

482
00:36:43,208 --> 00:36:45,208
Yok, I think that’s enough.

483
00:36:46,561 --> 00:36:47,284
Yok!

484
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:48,980
Are you really doing this?

485
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:49,681
Yes.

486
00:36:52,413 --> 00:36:53,785
The guards are here, Yok

487
00:36:56,483 --> 00:36:58,483
Yok!

488
00:36:59,905 --> 00:37:01,248
Yok, let’s go.

489
00:37:05,767 --> 00:37:06,721
Yok.

490
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:08,323
Come on.

491
00:37:10,044 --> 00:37:11,048
Yok, the guards are here.

492
00:37:12,036 --> 00:37:12,718
Yok.

493
00:37:13,635 --> 00:37:14,359
Yok.

494
00:37:17,216 --> 00:37:18,254
Yok, wait for me.

495
00:37:27,834 --> 00:37:29,604
Go to The Assembly Point 1.

496
00:37:30,226 --> 00:37:30,992
Go!

497
00:37:44,285 --> 00:37:45,010
Black,

498
00:37:45,658 --> 00:37:47,048
do you see the production line?

499
00:37:47,463 --> 00:37:48,459
Yes, I'm here.

500
00:37:49,671 --> 00:37:54,035
Make sure that drink is the most popular one.

501
00:39:23,406 --> 00:39:24,115
Black,

502
00:39:24,826 --> 00:39:25,740
add it.

503
00:39:27,116 --> 00:39:27,960
What are you waiting for?

504
00:39:31,955 --> 00:39:32,818
Damn it, Black!

505
00:39:33,195 --> 00:39:34,463
I told you to pour it.

506
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:41,637
What the heck are you doing?

507
00:39:41,943 --> 00:39:42,897
Damn you!

508
00:39:50,717 --> 00:39:51,504
Black,

509
00:39:52,171 --> 00:39:54,171
I said add the bitterant in the tank.

510
00:40:23,256 --> 00:40:24,064
Asshole!

511
00:40:24,396 --> 00:40:25,873
Why did you not put the substance in the tank?

512
00:40:26,806 --> 00:40:28,534
I asked you why?

513
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:37,608
You’re dead!

514
00:40:37,755 --> 00:40:38,625
Holy shit!

515
00:40:38,625 --> 00:40:39,636
Go the other way.

516
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,739
Stop!

517
00:41:46,651 --> 00:41:47,368
Come on.

518
00:41:47,829 --> 00:41:48,490
Black!

519
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:49,423
Sean!

520
00:41:50,667 --> 00:41:51,688
Black, get up.

521
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:52,701
Black.

522
00:41:54,193 --> 00:41:55,105
Let’s go.

523
00:42:00,296 --> 00:42:01,204
Are you okay?

524
00:42:10,209 --> 00:42:11,048
Sean!

525
00:42:12,671 --> 00:42:13,897
Why didn’t you follow the plan?

526
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:15,424
What the hell is wrong with you?

527
00:42:17,033 --> 00:42:17,945
Damn it, Sean!

528
00:42:17,945 --> 00:42:18,917
Sean, calm down.

529
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:21,248
- Sean!
- Everything is ruined because of you.

530
00:42:24,961 --> 00:42:25,608
Sean!

531
00:42:25,608 --> 00:42:26,501
Don’t intervene.

532
00:42:26,501 --> 00:42:27,258
Go away!

533
00:42:37,653 --> 00:42:39,130
That mission was so important to me.

534
00:42:39,734 --> 00:42:40,667
I trusted you.

535
00:42:41,319 --> 00:42:42,728
How did you do that to me?

536
00:42:56,370 --> 00:42:59,604
My dad died because of the shit they do.

537
00:43:04,587 --> 00:43:06,943
(In the second I almost lost my consciousness,)

538
00:43:07,288 --> 00:43:08,891
(my breaths were nearly out,)

539
00:43:09,683 --> 00:43:11,599
(I was almost dead because of Sean,)

540
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:15,284
(I started to doubt what I did.)

541
00:43:15,721 --> 00:43:19,436
(If it didn’t work, he’d want me to compensate for it with my life.)

542
00:43:28,132 --> 00:43:32,810
Directed by Anucha Boonyawatana

543
00:43:33,712 --> 00:43:35,048
If you wanted to do that,

544
00:43:35,617 --> 00:43:37,261
why didn’t you say anything when we went through the plan?

545
00:43:37,261 --> 00:43:39,872
I hope people can at least see that we’re against Tawi.

546
00:43:39,872 --> 00:43:41,747
It might trigger them to become more willing to fight.

547
00:43:41,747 --> 00:43:43,718
Citizens!!

548
00:43:44,524 --> 00:43:50,143
Put up the signs and tell them we will no longer tolerate oppression.

549
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:51,029
Right?

550
00:43:51,029 --> 00:43:52,743
Right!

551
00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:56,783
I never thought some people would have malicious intent towards me.

552
00:43:56,783 --> 00:43:58,519
Stop talking like you’re a saint.
