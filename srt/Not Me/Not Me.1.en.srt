3
00:01:25,756 --> 00:01:28,514
When you see someone who looks precisely like you,

4
00:01:28,514 --> 00:01:30,796
every part of his body resembles yours,

5
00:01:30,974 --> 00:01:33,447
you must feel really strange.

6
00:01:34,321 --> 00:01:37,369
But for me, it’s special.

7
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,926
I call that specialness ‘twins.’

8
00:01:57,861 --> 00:01:59,125
You lost again, White.

9
00:01:59,125 --> 00:02:00,866
One more round, Black.

10
00:02:00,866 --> 00:02:03,262
You’re going to lose again.

11
00:02:03,262 --> 00:02:04,173
Just give up.

12
00:02:04,173 --> 00:02:06,386
I’m not. It was so close.

13
00:02:06,386 --> 00:02:08,106
What’s my time, Todd?

14
00:02:08,106 --> 00:02:09,805
1:20 minutes.

15
00:02:09,805 --> 00:02:11,137
And Black’s?

16
00:02:11,137 --> 00:02:12,394
1:17 minutes.

17
00:02:12,394 --> 00:02:14,106
3 seconds only.

18
00:02:14,106 --> 00:02:15,706
You lost no matter how close it was.

19
00:02:15,706 --> 00:02:18,098
Beat Todd first and we’ll have a race again later.

20
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:23,083
Todd, let’s have a round.

21
00:02:23,313 --> 00:02:24,607
Just one, all right?

22
00:03:03,893 --> 00:03:05,269
Black.

23
00:03:10,654 --> 00:03:12,654
Is he okay now?

24
00:03:13,421 --> 00:03:15,220
Yes, he’s now conscious.

25
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:18,333
It’s okay.

26
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,780
Breathe slowly.

27
00:03:24,473 --> 00:03:26,473
Can you please look after them for a while?

28
00:03:27,778 --> 00:03:29,778
We need to talk.

29
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:36,422
Please.

30
00:03:36,422 --> 00:03:38,755
I can’t stand seeing them like this anymore.

31
00:03:38,755 --> 00:03:40,712
Tell me what your plan is.

32
00:03:41,063 --> 00:03:43,990
When our parents split up,

33
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:47,052
they used this incident as an excuse to separate Black and me

34
00:03:47,052 --> 00:03:49,174
and put us in different parts of the world.

35
00:03:49,693 --> 00:03:51,779
Are they fighting again?

36
00:04:08,505 --> 00:04:12,333
I haven’t felt our twin connection for so long,

37
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:15,762
since I decided to relocate to Russia with dad.

38
00:04:15,762 --> 00:04:18,122
That connection faded away a long time ago.

39
00:04:30,746 --> 00:04:32,746
Finished shower?

40
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:40,955
I know you don’t want to break up with me.

41
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,044
I don’t believe in long-distance relationships.

42
00:04:48,443 --> 00:04:51,915
Are you ready for work?

43
00:04:51,915 --> 00:04:54,746
No. I don’t even want to go back to Thailand.

44
00:04:54,746 --> 00:04:58,374
And your father? Where is he now?

45
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:07,995
He retired and went back to Thailand two years ago.

46
00:05:10,298 --> 00:05:12,298
It isn’t going to be so hard.

47
00:05:12,499 --> 00:05:15,451
Your dad has everything ready for you.

48
00:05:16,446 --> 00:05:19,960
You will be a diplomat like him in a few years.

49
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:54,875
Hi, Dad.

50
00:05:56,858 --> 00:05:58,858
Welcome home, White.

51
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:01,966
Why are you speaking Russian?

52
00:06:01,966 --> 00:06:05,272
I don’t know whom I should speak Russian to if not you.

53
00:06:05,272 --> 00:06:08,230
Do you want to go back to work?

54
00:06:08,676 --> 00:06:10,138
Don’t tease me.

55
00:06:10,138 --> 00:06:12,379
Take his luggage upstairs.

56
00:06:12,607 --> 00:06:14,479
Let’s get inside.

57
00:06:23,789 --> 00:06:26,606
White, it’s a ramp over there. Let’s go play.

58
00:06:26,807 --> 00:06:28,340
Okay.

59
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,990
Don’t be afraid. Do it again.

60
00:06:47,522 --> 00:06:50,726
Black, White, what are you two playing?

61
00:06:54,283 --> 00:06:56,283
Who just hit my car?

62
00:06:58,296 --> 00:07:00,296
It’s me, Black.

63
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:16,469
White, come on in.

64
00:07:23,923 --> 00:07:30,650
I’m not sure if this weird feeling I’m having is because I’m back here again,

65
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:34,004
or because of the connection between Black and me.

66
00:07:38,212 --> 00:07:40,212
Fill your stomach for now.

67
00:07:40,703 --> 00:07:43,144
I’ll take you out for dinner later.

68
00:07:52,027 --> 00:07:54,027
You seem hungry.

69
00:07:54,764 --> 00:07:56,792
Drink up.

70
00:08:01,346 --> 00:08:04,460
Do you know where Mom moved to?

71
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:09,926
Why would I care for someone who left us for someone else?

72
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,879
What about Black?

73
00:08:15,455 --> 00:08:17,455
I have no idea where he is.

74
00:08:18,241 --> 00:08:23,339
All I know is your mom took Black with her when we moved to Russia.

75
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:26,296
It was more than 10 years ago.

76
00:08:27,077 --> 00:08:29,077
Stop thinking about them.

77
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:31,371
Just live your life.

78
00:08:31,716 --> 00:08:34,452
And let them live theirs. It’s better this way, White.

79
00:08:38,741 --> 00:08:40,741
Thank you for coming.

80
00:08:42,079 --> 00:08:44,547
White, meet Mr. Vichian.

81
00:08:44,547 --> 00:08:46,599
He works in The Department.

82
00:08:47,812 --> 00:08:51,194
White just graduated International Relations from Russia.

83
00:08:51,194 --> 00:08:54,704
He completed an advanced test, which allowed him to graduate ahead of peers his age.

84
00:08:54,704 --> 00:08:56,086
How’s the education there?

85
00:08:56,086 --> 00:08:57,263
Is it the same as in Thailand?

86
00:08:58,123 --> 00:09:01,446
I'm not really certain. I think it’s a bit different.

87
00:09:01,446 --> 00:09:05,269
I made friends from all around the world when I was there.

88
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:09,031
They are both from Europe, Asia, and Russia.

89
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,191
They introduced me to diverse cultures and perspectives.

90
00:09:14,479 --> 00:09:17,705
He will be just fine working in my department.

91
00:09:18,907 --> 00:09:20,881
Mr. Vichian,

92
00:09:20,881 --> 00:09:23,406
White is taking a test for a position in The Ministry next week.

93
00:09:23,562 --> 00:09:25,182
Do you want some books to study?

94
00:09:25,182 --> 00:09:27,422
I have a ton of questions from the previous tests.

95
00:09:27,422 --> 00:09:30,510
The first round will consist of a general knowledge test.

96
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:33,827
We shouldn't be concerned about your foreign affairs knowledge.

97
00:09:33,827 --> 00:09:37,044
But are you aware of the situation in Thailand?

98
00:09:39,193 --> 00:09:41,193
White is smart.

99
00:09:41,193 --> 00:09:45,750
He never stays behind. He always keeps up with the news in Thailand.

100
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,497
We have nothing to worry about.

101
00:09:47,497 --> 00:09:49,463
Is that so?

102
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:52,905
You are great and have a bright future ahead of you, just like your father.

103
00:09:53,462 --> 00:09:55,456
Thank you.

104
00:09:55,590 --> 00:10:01,446
White, these two right here were my trainees back then.

105
00:10:01,704 --> 00:10:06,130
I can put my mind at ease if you get to work with them.

106
00:10:08,289 --> 00:10:12,362
Please help advise my son.

107
00:10:15,549 --> 00:10:17,549
Follow him!

108
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:23,087
Thank you.

109
00:10:48,711 --> 00:10:50,711
White!

110
00:10:51,446 --> 00:10:53,446
White, are you all right?

111
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,216
Black is dying.

112
00:11:00,216 --> 00:11:02,028
What happened to him? Who hurt him?

113
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:04,081
If you still want to see him,

114
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:06,317
come meet me at the hospital.

115
00:11:06,317 --> 00:11:08,317


116
00:11:35,363 --> 00:11:38,172
The result reveals nothing out of the ordinary.

117
00:11:38,707 --> 00:11:41,200
Perhaps he is unfamiliar with the weather?

118
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,034
He'd recently returned from Russia.

119
00:11:43,034 --> 00:11:44,837
I don’t think that’s the case.

120
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:46,963
Anyway, we'll get another medical checkup tomorrow.

121
00:11:52,254 --> 00:11:54,254
How are you feeling, White?

122
00:11:55,105 --> 00:11:57,105
It’s better now.

123
00:11:57,418 --> 00:11:59,063
It was weird.

124
00:11:59,194 --> 00:12:01,433
I just couldn’t breathe normally all of a sudden.

125
00:12:01,973 --> 00:12:05,311
Let’s stay here one more night to get closely checked.

126
00:12:05,311 --> 00:12:06,357
Sure.

127
00:12:39,294 --> 00:12:40,794
Hello, White.

128
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:42,366
Hello.

129
00:12:42,589 --> 00:12:43,824
Todd?

130
00:12:44,277 --> 00:12:46,277
Yes, it’s me.

131
00:12:46,277 --> 00:12:48,439
Still remember me?

132
00:12:48,756 --> 00:12:50,718
I do.

133
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:54,410
I have news about Black to tell you.

134
00:12:55,977 --> 00:12:58,669
Black is dying.

135
00:12:59,964 --> 00:13:01,964
What happened to him? Who hurt him?

136
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,302
If you still want to see him,

137
00:13:05,302 --> 00:13:07,291
come meet me at the hospital.

138
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:09,361
I’ll share with you the location.

139
00:13:18,749 --> 00:13:20,180
White.

140
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,124
Let’s visit him in ICU.

141
00:13:22,124 --> 00:13:23,170
Really?

142
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:25,337
Is it that bad?

143
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:28,302
I don’t know.

144
00:13:28,302 --> 00:13:30,470
He called and said he was being hunted down.

145
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:31,856
Hunted down?

146
00:13:31,856 --> 00:13:33,156
What did he do?

147
00:13:35,179 --> 00:13:36,895
Didn’t you guys talk at all?

148
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,676
No.

149
00:13:37,676 --> 00:13:39,550
What happened to him?

150
00:13:43,003 --> 00:13:45,003
After you moved to Russia,

151
00:13:45,346 --> 00:13:47,574
Black and I have always gone to the same school.

152
00:13:47,574 --> 00:13:50,051
In university, he’s been dropping out and re-enrolling in classes.

153
00:13:50,051 --> 00:13:52,906
He's always argued with his mom, so I asked him to stay with me.

154
00:13:53,295 --> 00:13:56,429
But lately, he’s had a new group of friends to hang out with.

155
00:13:56,429 --> 00:13:58,176
They seem savage.

156
00:13:58,176 --> 00:14:00,489
So I warned him not to trust them so much.

157
00:14:00,489 --> 00:14:01,822
He just wouldn’t listen.

158
00:14:01,822 --> 00:14:05,240
I don’t know if my theory is right

159
00:14:05,431 --> 00:14:10,034
but I think they’re the reason why Black ended up like this.

160
00:15:40,419 --> 00:15:44,890
He once told me if something happened to him,

161
00:15:45,262 --> 00:15:47,223
I must give you this handkerchief.

162
00:15:48,629 --> 00:15:52,816
And you’d know what he wanted.

163
00:16:01,405 --> 00:16:03,069
White.

164
00:16:03,448 --> 00:16:04,913
Take it back.

165
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,013
Did you start a fight with them?

166
00:16:07,013 --> 00:16:08,641
I didn’t start.

167
00:16:08,641 --> 00:16:10,236
They took your money, didn’t they?

168
00:16:10,349 --> 00:16:12,745
I just took this wallet back for you.

169
00:16:18,768 --> 00:16:20,397
Don't let anyone take advantage of you.

170
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:22,716
If you don’t fight, you’ll never win.

171
00:16:25,712 --> 00:16:27,712
Promise me you will fight.

172
00:16:30,616 --> 00:16:32,616
Say it, White.

173
00:16:34,196 --> 00:16:36,196
Promise me.

174
00:16:36,393 --> 00:16:38,366
Give me your word.

175
00:16:45,374 --> 00:16:46,849
I promise.

176
00:16:47,002 --> 00:16:48,738
From now on,

177
00:16:48,738 --> 00:16:51,741
if anybody picks on me, I will fight back.

178
00:16:52,439 --> 00:16:54,627
I won’t let anyone take advantage of me again.

179
00:16:54,627 --> 00:16:56,802
And if anyone hurts you,

180
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,447
I’ll not let them walk free either.

181
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,063
I will take your place in the gang

182
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:40,348
and find those who hurt you.

183
00:17:49,308 --> 00:17:51,308
Time alters our bodies.

184
00:17:51,308 --> 00:17:54,165
What he went through,

185
00:17:54,165 --> 00:17:57,254
his journey was completely different than mine.

186
00:17:57,254 --> 00:17:59,874
We used to look exactly alike.

187
00:17:59,874 --> 00:18:02,685
Today, he’s quite different.

188
00:18:07,812 --> 00:18:12,589
Seeing his body this time makes me sad.

189
00:18:16,135 --> 00:18:18,135
He’s been through a lot.

190
00:18:18,135 --> 00:18:21,357
I have no idea how painful he felt.

191
00:18:34,767 --> 00:18:36,417
Hi, Black.

192
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:44,095
Come on.

193
00:19:02,102 --> 00:19:04,102
Did Black live here alone?

194
00:19:05,536 --> 00:19:06,452
Yes.

195
00:19:06,452 --> 00:19:08,124
I don’t think he’s dating anyone.

196
00:20:06,832 --> 00:20:08,832
B.

197
00:20:13,261 --> 00:20:15,261
G.

198
00:20:17,855 --> 00:20:20,401
You should wear his clothes.

199
00:20:21,035 --> 00:20:24,389
Wearing new clothes can make people suspicious.

200
00:20:38,252 --> 00:20:40,252
I think I need new boxers.

201
00:20:40,252 --> 00:20:41,421
Wear them, all right.

202
00:20:41,421 --> 00:20:42,634
They won’t give you a rash.

203
00:20:42,634 --> 00:20:44,978
You guys are twins. I guess you two wear the same size.

204
00:20:44,978 --> 00:20:46,344
Same size, my foot!

205
00:20:46,344 --> 00:20:47,800
Are you shy?

206
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,081
I was just teasing.

207
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,876
Wearing his clothes helps you disguise yourself better.

208
00:20:50,876 --> 00:20:52,772
Who would even notice my underwear?

209
00:20:55,894 --> 00:20:58,769
See? You’re wearing brand-name panties.

210
00:20:58,769 --> 00:21:01,129
People can tell you’re not Black.

211
00:21:01,397 --> 00:21:03,617
If you get caught, you’re over.

212
00:21:04,432 --> 00:21:05,820
Are you exaggerating?

213
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:06,768
No.

214
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:10,010
Face ID.

215
00:21:12,055 --> 00:21:13,421
Look at this.

216
00:21:13,421 --> 00:21:15,614
This is Gram, your faculty friend.

217
00:21:15,614 --> 00:21:16,939
Black is still a university student?

218
00:21:16,939 --> 00:21:17,757
Yes.

219
00:21:17,757 --> 00:21:20,261
I dropped out for a year after having a fight with his mom.

220
00:21:20,261 --> 00:21:22,466
This is Yok, The Faculty Fine and Applied Arts.

221
00:21:23,298 --> 00:21:26,466
This is Sean, The Faculty of Political Science.

222
00:21:26,796 --> 00:21:29,299
They are very dangerous.

223
00:21:29,898 --> 00:21:32,185
You must look after yourself.

224
00:21:32,185 --> 00:21:36,087
I think they’re involved with some illegal business.

225
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:38,683
Do you think Black was really involved with an illegal business?

226
00:21:39,452 --> 00:21:40,936
Are you scared?

227
00:21:41,526 --> 00:21:43,839
If you are, you have a chance to back off now.

228
00:21:45,649 --> 00:21:47,255
No.

229
00:21:47,255 --> 00:21:49,663
I will track down those who injured Black

230
00:21:50,662 --> 00:21:53,056
and put them all behind bars.

231
00:21:59,299 --> 00:22:01,299
You’re early today.

232
00:22:01,299 --> 00:22:03,759
Gram, where’s everyone?

233
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:05,811
You never asked about anyone.

234
00:22:05,811 --> 00:22:08,295
Where the heck have you been exactly?

235
00:22:08,295 --> 00:22:10,295


236
00:22:52,285 --> 00:22:55,537
[Special Alumni Talk]
[Tawi Kuerkulsvasti, Thailand's most successful businessman.]

237
00:22:56,442 --> 00:23:01,671
(Tawi Kuerkulsvasti, a businessman who’s continually been in the headlines since I lived in Russia.)

238
00:23:01,951 --> 00:23:04,889
(Tawi is a supporter of a political party.)

239
00:23:04,889 --> 00:23:08,255
(He has the ability to strike economic bargains and run the country.)

240
00:23:08,255 --> 00:23:11,034
(He’s become the first tycoon on people’s boycott list.)

241
00:23:11,432 --> 00:23:13,547
You’re early today.

242
00:23:13,547 --> 00:23:15,087
You’ve been gone for days. Where were you?

243
00:23:17,407 --> 00:23:18,573
Gram.

244
00:23:19,634 --> 00:23:21,634
I got up early. That’s why I came early.

245
00:23:22,907 --> 00:23:24,907
Should we join and cause him some trouble?

246
00:23:24,907 --> 00:23:27,390
Make him afraid to show up at any other event.

247
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:28,483
Cause him trouble?

248
00:23:28,985 --> 00:23:31,187
Like you said.

249
00:23:31,187 --> 00:23:33,492
This asshole enjoys taking advantage of others.

250
00:23:33,492 --> 00:23:35,010
He will pay someday.

251
00:23:39,663 --> 00:23:41,663
You’re wearing perfume now?

252
00:23:41,663 --> 00:23:44,627
Do you want to eat first or go straight to class?

253
00:23:44,627 --> 00:23:47,426
Hey, your skin looks better.

254
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,070
You styled your hair too, huh?

255
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,395
I didn’t.

256
00:23:50,395 --> 00:23:52,203
Come on. I’m not complaining.

257
00:23:52,203 --> 00:23:54,269
I’d always wanted you to do it but you never did.

258
00:23:54,269 --> 00:23:56,269
Ah! I know it.

259
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:57,920
You were missing

260
00:23:59,299 --> 00:24:00,842
because you met a girl, didn’t you?

261
00:24:00,842 --> 00:24:02,169
No girl.

262
00:24:02,169 --> 00:24:03,483
Let’s get to class.

263
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:04,415
Where’s the class anyway?

264
00:24:04,415 --> 00:24:05,600
Want to know where?

265
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,602
Catch up with me.

266
00:24:11,415 --> 00:24:13,143
Gram, Black.

267
00:24:14,091 --> 00:24:15,456
(Who’s she now?)

268
00:24:15,982 --> 00:24:19,256
I thought we were late, but the professor is even later.

269
00:24:19,353 --> 00:24:21,111
She was here but she left.

270
00:24:21,111 --> 00:24:23,466
We’re supposed to study Rule of Law and Rule by Law.

271
00:24:23,466 --> 00:24:24,797
Then we’ll take a quiz.

272
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:26,427
So, there’s a quiz today?

273
00:24:27,513 --> 00:24:30,257
This class always comes with a quiz. Why do you sound surprised?

274
00:24:34,029 --> 00:24:36,029
Look at you. Did you forget?

275
00:24:36,768 --> 00:24:39,385
Fine, I’ll help you study.

276
00:24:39,699 --> 00:24:41,824
What’s the difference between Rule of Law and Rule by Law?

277
00:24:41,824 --> 00:24:43,244
Tell me.

278
00:24:44,017 --> 00:24:45,582
Come again.

279
00:24:46,065 --> 00:24:49,144
What’s the difference between Rule of Law and Rule by Law?

280
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:54,666
What are the words in Thai?

281
00:24:56,704 --> 00:25:01,098
To use the rule of law and to be ruled by law?

282
00:25:01,098 --> 00:25:02,512
Almost got it.

283
00:25:02,512 --> 00:25:08,986
Rule of Law means all laws apply equally or we call it ‘Nititham’ in Thai.

284
00:25:08,986 --> 00:25:11,535
And the countries where rule of law applies are called ‘Nitirat.’

285
00:25:11,535 --> 00:25:12,902
Legal states.

286
00:25:12,902 --> 00:25:13,896
Right you are.

287
00:25:13,896 --> 00:25:15,406
It got stuck on the tip of my tongue.

288
00:25:15,406 --> 00:25:17,379
You’re normally an expert on this stuff.

289
00:25:17,379 --> 00:25:19,584
Were you trying to test Gram?

290
00:25:21,046 --> 00:25:23,862
No. I just forgot the Thai words.

291
00:25:25,242 --> 00:25:27,605
Fine. Let me start over.

292
00:25:27,937 --> 00:25:31,674
Rule of Law is the highest and the most sacred law.

293
00:25:31,674 --> 00:25:33,760
The whole state is subject to the law.

294
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,999
Everyone is equal under the same law.

295
00:25:36,311 --> 00:25:39,369
Now, do you think Thailand is led by ‘rule of law?’

296
00:25:39,732 --> 00:25:41,452
Of course.

297
00:25:42,074 --> 00:25:44,343
Are you trying to drive me nuts, Black?

298
00:25:44,343 --> 00:25:46,253
Thailand is obviously under ‘rule by law.’

299
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:48,298
Citizens are governed by law.

300
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:50,735
Governing authorities make and enforce laws to benefit themselves.

301
00:25:50,735 --> 00:25:52,672
They interpret the laws to persecute people who oppose them.

302
00:25:52,672 --> 00:25:54,811
This is called a double standard.

303
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,321
You’re wrong.

304
00:25:57,321 --> 00:26:00,630
Thai laws are obliged by statutory interpretation.

305
00:26:00,842 --> 00:26:03,766
You might disagree with the court’s verdict,

306
00:26:03,766 --> 00:26:06,966
but you can’t assume it's not in the best interests of most people.

307
00:26:06,966 --> 00:26:10,080
You’re a law student, you must provide statutory references.

308
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,833
We need to debate it case by case. That’s the right thing to do.

309
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:15,268
Then for this quiz,

310
00:26:15,268 --> 00:26:17,747
I’ll mention Tawi’s forest trespassing property.

311
00:26:17,747 --> 00:26:19,212
It's the most obvious case.

312
00:26:19,535 --> 00:26:22,393
Tawi was able to purchase a national forest to build a residence.

313
00:26:22,393 --> 00:26:24,307
However, native people who had previously resided there were evicted.

314
00:26:24,307 --> 00:26:26,886
It exemplifies the concept of ‘rule by law.’

315
00:26:26,886 --> 00:26:29,297
The same legislation was applied differently.

316
00:26:29,297 --> 00:26:32,843
Villagers had no power and voices.

317
00:26:32,843 --> 00:26:35,914
They were evicted even if they could provide proof that they’d lived there for generations.

318
00:26:35,914 --> 00:26:38,093
Hey, I get you.

319
00:26:38,093 --> 00:26:41,976
But you need to consider the fact that Tawi had land ownership paperwork.

320
00:26:42,162 --> 00:26:44,332
The locals, however, did not.

321
00:26:44,332 --> 00:26:47,302
If you use this case, you will not receive a score.

322
00:26:47,302 --> 00:26:48,815
I'm afraid I won't be able to help you.

323
00:26:49,267 --> 00:26:50,813
Was there such a case like that?

324
00:26:58,296 --> 00:27:00,296
Stop pretending.

325
00:27:00,296 --> 00:27:01,998
I know you’re trying to fool me.

326
00:27:02,263 --> 00:27:04,167
You’re kidding me, aren’t you?

327
00:27:08,628 --> 00:27:10,048
The professor is here.

328
00:27:10,242 --> 00:27:11,873
Are we all ready?

329
00:27:12,326 --> 00:27:15,344
Let’s go through it again before the quiz.

330
00:27:15,761 --> 00:27:17,259
Please take a look over here.

331
00:27:18,098 --> 00:27:21,585
Now try to memorize the slides.

332
00:27:22,638 --> 00:27:24,638
And you have memorized it all, right?

333
00:27:24,842 --> 00:27:26,846
Let’s start the quiz now.

334
00:27:30,737 --> 00:27:32,737
Where is everyone?

335
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Why are you asking about them?

336
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,335
Can’t I ask?

337
00:27:38,059 --> 00:27:40,199
You don’t usually ask for anyone.

338
00:27:40,579 --> 00:27:42,315
You’re acting weird today.

339
00:27:43,358 --> 00:27:46,260
I just have something to talk to them about.

340
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,009
Are you guys fighting again?

341
00:27:48,082 --> 00:27:50,298
We’re going to the garage anyway. Let’s meet them there.

342
00:28:06,998 --> 00:28:08,218
Why are you just standing there?

343
00:28:08,218 --> 00:28:09,653
Where is your ride?

344
00:28:09,653 --> 00:28:10,712
What ride?

345
00:28:11,443 --> 00:28:13,443
Your motorbike.

346
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:16,292
What’s up with you today?

347
00:28:17,485 --> 00:28:19,485
The engine died. I left it at home.

348
00:28:19,485 --> 00:28:20,342
Hey!

349
00:28:20,942 --> 00:28:22,296
But you must have a ride today.

350
00:28:22,296 --> 00:28:23,431
Did you forget?

351
00:28:24,149 --> 00:28:27,296
I couldn’t get it started. What do you want me to do?

352
00:28:33,626 --> 00:28:35,626
Where have you been exactly?

353
00:28:37,339 --> 00:28:39,339
I got some personal stuff to deal with.

354
00:28:39,339 --> 00:28:41,044
Why do you want to know?

355
00:28:43,724 --> 00:28:44,726
Fine.

356
00:28:45,125 --> 00:28:46,664
I won’t butt in.

357
00:28:46,664 --> 00:28:48,953
I just know your ride is quite a big deal for you.

358
00:28:48,953 --> 00:28:50,356
It’s surprising it broke down today.

359
00:28:51,934 --> 00:28:53,934
Ride with me for now.

360
00:28:58,308 --> 00:28:58,984
Here.

361
00:28:58,984 --> 00:28:59,899
Whose helmet is that?

362
00:28:59,899 --> 00:29:01,982
Just take it. We can return it later.

363
00:29:10,762 --> 00:29:11,674
Black,

364
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:14,420
you keep surprising me today.

365
00:29:14,993 --> 00:29:16,394
Why?

366
00:29:17,453 --> 00:29:18,600
Nothing.

367
00:29:18,842 --> 00:29:20,284
This is good.

368
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:22,884
I like this version of you.

369
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,088
Shit!

370
00:29:38,208 --> 00:29:39,842
What are you doing?

371
00:29:40,513 --> 00:29:42,249
I’m using the bathroom.

372
00:29:43,056 --> 00:29:44,312
Don’t lie.

373
00:29:44,312 --> 00:29:46,312


374
00:30:53,192 --> 00:30:55,192
Hey, Yok.

375
00:30:55,629 --> 00:30:57,406
Why are you guys so early?

376
00:30:57,406 --> 00:30:58,820
I need to bring the motorbike for you to wrap.

377
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,561
We must get it done by tonight.

378
00:31:00,561 --> 00:31:01,817
I’m on it.

379
00:31:02,164 --> 00:31:04,010
I’ll go get my stuff.

380
00:31:04,138 --> 00:31:05,791
Just make it quick.

381
00:31:13,562 --> 00:31:15,562
Hi, Yok.

382
00:31:18,933 --> 00:31:22,000
(What the heck? Why is he not talking to me?)

383
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,131
You’re doing a nice job there.

384
00:31:27,002 --> 00:31:29,002
Are you giving me a compliment?

385
00:31:32,613 --> 00:31:34,613
I was being sarcastic.

386
00:31:34,613 --> 00:31:36,117
Do you really think it’s nice?

387
00:31:36,433 --> 00:31:38,069
I don’t think so.

388
00:31:38,069 --> 00:31:40,033
It’s just a motorbike wrap.

389
00:31:40,033 --> 00:31:42,115
How pretty do you want? Why don’t you just do it yourself?

390
00:33:23,617 --> 00:33:25,617
What are you doing?

391
00:33:27,197 --> 00:33:29,197
I’m using the bathroom.

392
00:33:37,707 --> 00:33:39,183
Don’t lie.

393
00:33:39,436 --> 00:33:41,607
Why are you sneaking into my room?

394
00:33:43,561 --> 00:33:45,561
I…

395
00:34:01,431 --> 00:34:03,431
What’s got into you today?

396
00:34:08,685 --> 00:34:10,611
Sean, the fuel is leaking.

397
00:34:10,611 --> 00:34:12,178
Come down and take a look.

398
00:34:13,824 --> 00:34:15,824
How did it happen?

399
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:36,950
(That guy doesn’t seem to like Black very much)

400
00:34:37,203 --> 00:34:39,512
(Why would he want to punch a friend?)

401
00:34:45,286 --> 00:34:46,939
What are you staring at?

402
00:34:47,162 --> 00:34:48,532
I am not staring.

403
00:34:48,662 --> 00:34:50,267
You obviously are.

404
00:34:55,257 --> 00:34:58,175
I just want to check if you’re fixing it up nicely.

405
00:34:59,676 --> 00:35:01,676
And you care about my ride because?

406
00:35:01,676 --> 00:35:03,218
You didn’t bring your own vehicle.

407
00:35:03,218 --> 00:35:05,075
What a burden.

408
00:35:06,997 --> 00:35:08,997
Bring me the engine oil.

409
00:35:17,696 --> 00:35:19,696
Which one is it?

410
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:29,834
Here.

411
00:35:33,842 --> 00:35:35,265
You did that on purpose, didn’t you?

412
00:35:35,265 --> 00:35:37,145
I didn’t. I didn’t see it.

413
00:35:37,145 --> 00:35:38,881
You know I’m changing the oil.

414
00:35:38,881 --> 00:35:41,349
The tray can’t be anywhere other than here.

415
00:35:41,349 --> 00:35:43,623
I honestly didn’t see it. I didn’t mean to.

416
00:35:43,623 --> 00:35:45,055
Come here.

417
00:35:52,063 --> 00:35:54,063
Let go.

418
00:35:59,525 --> 00:36:01,525
You deserved that.

419
00:36:01,525 --> 00:36:03,020
I won’t get messed up alone.

420
00:36:11,267 --> 00:36:13,267
Stop.

421
00:36:15,333 --> 00:36:17,333
Where are you going?

422
00:36:17,333 --> 00:36:18,752
Don’t come any closer.

423
00:36:18,752 --> 00:36:19,677
Stop!

424
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:24,446
I said stop!!

425
00:36:31,669 --> 00:36:33,669
Gotcha!

426
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:45,973
What the hell are you two playing?

427
00:36:47,809 --> 00:36:49,809
(Who is this guy now?)

428
00:36:50,272 --> 00:36:52,494
You just messed up the floor, you assholes.

429
00:36:52,494 --> 00:36:55,320
Do you have any idea how difficult to clean off the oil?

430
00:36:56,269 --> 00:36:57,755
I’m sorry.

431
00:36:57,755 --> 00:36:59,562
Black freaking bugged me.

432
00:37:00,401 --> 00:37:01,946
Clean yourself up.

433
00:37:01,946 --> 00:37:03,352
We need to discuss something tonight.

434
00:37:03,352 --> 00:37:04,763
(Tonight?)

435
00:37:04,763 --> 00:37:06,661
(What the hell is happening tonight?)

436
00:37:06,661 --> 00:37:07,898
Hurry.

437
00:37:09,205 --> 00:37:11,205
Do it in the car wash area.

438
00:37:11,205 --> 00:37:13,249
Don’t use my bathroom. You’ll mess it up too.

439
00:37:14,863 --> 00:37:16,863
You go too.

440
00:37:21,842 --> 00:37:23,842
It won’t come off.

441
00:37:34,562 --> 00:37:36,478
Soap won’t do the work.

442
00:37:36,478 --> 00:37:37,918
What should I use then?

443
00:37:37,918 --> 00:37:39,118
Laundry detergent.

444
00:37:39,118 --> 00:37:40,360
What are you doing?

445
00:37:53,386 --> 00:37:55,386
Since when you’re such a baby?

446
00:37:55,386 --> 00:37:56,513
Hurry up.

447
00:37:56,513 --> 00:37:57,855
I need to fix the motorbike.

448
00:37:57,855 --> 00:37:59,569
We must be on time tonight.

449
00:37:59,569 --> 00:38:01,143
Just go then.

450
00:38:01,143 --> 00:38:02,472
I can wash myself.

451
00:38:02,472 --> 00:38:04,162
I need to wash too, you know?

452
00:38:07,015 --> 00:38:08,147
You use that one.

453
00:38:08,147 --> 00:38:09,561
I’ll use this one.

454
00:38:30,209 --> 00:38:31,564
How’s the wrapping, Yok?

455
00:38:31,564 --> 00:38:33,159
Completely done.

456
00:38:39,663 --> 00:38:41,663
Can we have new plates?

457
00:38:48,567 --> 00:38:50,567
Take your pick.

458
00:38:57,261 --> 00:38:58,442
1 Jan?

459
00:38:58,442 --> 00:39:00,060
What’s this, New Year Party?

460
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:01,783
Should we throw a party now?

461
00:39:02,103 --> 00:39:04,449
I’ll take this one. It’s so fake.

462
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:12,409
(What are they even doing?)

463
00:39:12,409 --> 00:39:14,116
Sean, are you coming?

464
00:39:16,752 --> 00:39:18,752
Choose it yourself.

465
00:39:29,743 --> 00:39:31,743
Guys, gather here when you finish.

466
00:39:43,015 --> 00:39:46,504
Here. The new masks I designed.

467
00:39:50,637 --> 00:39:52,063
It’s quite unique.

468
00:39:52,063 --> 00:39:54,023
In a good or bad way?

469
00:39:54,201 --> 00:39:56,160
Unique means good to me.

470
00:39:57,435 --> 00:39:59,435
But for Black, it means bad.

471
00:39:59,435 --> 00:40:01,798
In his freaking opinion, nothing is good.

472
00:40:01,798 --> 00:40:04,521
You guys talk about him like he isn’t here.

473
00:40:04,994 --> 00:40:06,674
He finally showed up, Black.

474
00:40:06,674 --> 00:40:08,771
I’m just being myself. What’s wrong with that?

475
00:40:15,768 --> 00:40:17,768
Are you ready?

476
00:40:20,409 --> 00:40:22,409
I am. I always am.

477
00:40:23,555 --> 00:40:24,190
Okay.

478
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:26,814
I’ll walk you through our plan again.

479
00:40:26,814 --> 00:40:28,877
Yok, when we get to the abandoned gas station,

480
00:40:28,877 --> 00:40:31,807
take with you the hidden gasoline as much as you can.

481
00:40:31,807 --> 00:40:34,594
Gram, you’re on watch.

482
00:40:34,594 --> 00:40:36,509
Make sure no one is in the house.

483
00:40:36,509 --> 00:40:38,689
Sean, you take charge of the anesthetic.

484
00:40:38,689 --> 00:40:42,623
When things go wrong, know that you can use force only when you need to.

485
00:40:44,028 --> 00:40:49,863
Black, when you get there, you must be the one taking care of everything.

486
00:40:53,111 --> 00:40:55,111
Do you get what I’m saying?

487
00:40:59,724 --> 00:41:00,508
Okay.

488
00:41:00,508 --> 00:41:03,141
Is everything clear to you all?

489
00:41:05,617 --> 00:41:07,791
Good luck. Be safe.

490
00:41:13,768 --> 00:41:15,768
Are you truly up for it?

491
00:41:22,142 --> 00:41:24,142
You come with me.

492
00:41:35,372 --> 00:41:37,372
Grab your helmet.

493
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:54,663
Let’s go.

494
00:41:54,663 --> 00:41:56,652
Let’s burn down Tawi’s house.

495
00:42:17,103 --> 00:42:21,183
Directed by Anucha Boonyawatana

496
00:42:23,354 --> 00:42:24,663
Black.

497
00:42:25,184 --> 00:42:27,137
What are you doing?

498
00:42:29,433 --> 00:42:31,433
Do you want us all to die here?

499
00:42:34,142 --> 00:42:36,142
I think it should be a better way.

500
00:42:37,476 --> 00:42:38,831
Damn you, Gram!

501
00:42:38,831 --> 00:42:40,998
You said no one was in the house.

502
00:42:42,178 --> 00:42:44,178
Stay focused.

503
00:42:48,598 --> 00:42:50,598
I quit.
