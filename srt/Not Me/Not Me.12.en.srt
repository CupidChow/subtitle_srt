3
00:00:17,861 --> 00:00:19,447
You left me.

4
00:00:19,447 --> 00:00:20,453
Why did you come back?

5
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:22,235
Isn’t what I’m doing clear enough to you?

6
00:00:22,235 --> 00:00:25,625
The truck driver that I shot to death was Sean’s father.

7
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:29,716
What you’re doing right now is like slowly fixing what you’ve done wrong.

8
00:00:29,716 --> 00:00:31,288
You got a cop involved.

9
00:00:31,288 --> 00:00:32,649
How can you even trust him?

10
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,681
You’re not like the Black that I love.

11
00:00:35,681 --> 00:00:37,258
You have a twin brother?

12
00:00:37,258 --> 00:00:38,869
Don’t you get close to my little brother again.

13
00:00:40,191 --> 00:00:42,191
There’s no way you can stop me.

14
00:00:42,191 --> 00:00:43,794
won’t stay away from him.

15
00:00:59,174 --> 00:01:01,174
I told him to go home,

16
00:01:01,174 --> 00:01:02,820
not to get involved in any of this

17
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,290
and not to see you again.

18
00:01:06,271 --> 00:01:08,271
He won’t listen to you.

19
00:01:08,628 --> 00:01:10,427
He just saved my life.

20
00:01:10,427 --> 00:01:12,093
I’ll go look for him.

21
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,063
Come here.

22
00:01:19,063 --> 00:01:20,622
I said come here.

23
00:01:25,947 --> 00:01:28,480
What the hell are you two playing with the handcuffs?

24
00:01:29,733 --> 00:01:32,707
He just has a twin brother. There’s no need to start a war.

25
00:01:33,334 --> 00:01:35,510
How did you know that?

26
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:37,522
I’ve known it since you burned down Tawi’s house.

27
00:01:39,563 --> 00:01:40,753
You knew.

28
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:43,097
Then why did you let him in?

29
00:01:43,097 --> 00:01:45,628
He’s an outsider. How could you trust him?

30
00:01:45,628 --> 00:01:47,605
Since when?

31
00:01:47,605 --> 00:01:50,648
Sean, you slept next to him every night.

32
00:01:50,648 --> 00:01:52,128
Haven’t you noticed?

33
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,700
I was just suspecting it.

34
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,628
But how did you find out?

35
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,964
I taught him to shoot a gun.

36
00:01:57,964 --> 00:02:02,028
I knew right away by touching his hands that he’d never done anything himself.

37
00:02:02,028 --> 00:02:03,187
Of course, I could tell.

38
00:02:03,187 --> 00:02:04,662
You knew and you never said anything.

39
00:02:04,662 --> 00:02:06,039
Why did I need to say anything?

40
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:07,926
You shouldn’t have dragged my brother into this.

41
00:02:08,258 --> 00:02:10,583
How could you make him work?

42
00:02:13,718 --> 00:02:15,000
Black,

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,330
your brother worked so well.

44
00:02:17,607 --> 00:02:19,192
He’s better than you.

45
00:02:19,192 --> 00:02:20,722
I don’t care whose brother he is.

46
00:02:20,722 --> 00:02:22,689
If he’s ready to work, he’s on.

47
00:02:22,689 --> 00:02:29,560
To make a change, we must have people who are willing to get on board and fight with us.

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,751
That way we have a better chance to win.

49
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:33,344
Then you can recruit anyone

50
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:35,020
but my brother.

51
00:02:36,163 --> 00:02:38,163
You have no right to stop him.

52
00:02:38,163 --> 00:02:39,033
And who are you?

53
00:02:39,163 --> 00:02:41,721
Do you have any right to mess with my family member?

54
00:02:43,623 --> 00:02:45,623
I’m not his brother

55
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:48,063
but I know him better than his own brother does.

56
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:50,701
Damn it!

57
00:02:52,731 --> 00:02:55,235
You two stop messing around and find the key.

58
00:02:55,492 --> 00:02:59,007
Black, when you’re free, come see me.

59
00:03:01,906 --> 00:03:03,906
Find the key.

60
00:03:05,481 --> 00:03:07,279
Where did I throw it?

61
00:03:07,279 --> 00:03:09,336
How dumb were you to throw it away?

62
00:03:09,336 --> 00:03:11,473
Should we cut our hands off then?

63
00:03:11,473 --> 00:03:13,408
Go get an ax.

64
00:04:20,804 --> 00:04:23,283
Black, tell me the story.

65
00:04:23,283 --> 00:04:25,084
Where did you go?

66
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:32,139
You remember my friend Todd?

67
00:04:33,347 --> 00:04:36,155
I found out his company was in cooperation with Tawi’s.

68
00:04:37,545 --> 00:04:41,065
And then you said you’d deal with him alone, right?

69
00:04:41,065 --> 00:04:42,767
I failed.

70
00:04:42,767 --> 00:04:44,468
He got me.

71
00:04:45,246 --> 00:04:47,205
Then he came up with this idea

72
00:04:47,205 --> 00:04:50,855
of using my brother to take on the mission and attack Tawi.

73
00:04:50,917 --> 00:04:54,858
If he succeeded, he’d get to the top and take Tawi’s place.

74
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:00,898
And where is your brother now?

75
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:03,601
Probably back to his old life.

76
00:05:04,855 --> 00:05:06,855
Black,

77
00:05:06,855 --> 00:05:09,023
life isn’t that easy.

78
00:05:09,546 --> 00:05:12,834
Your brother left his life behind for you.

79
00:05:12,834 --> 00:05:15,101
He can’t just go back to the way it was.

80
00:05:15,473 --> 00:05:17,529
He must be really lost now.

81
00:05:17,529 --> 00:05:19,885
Talk to him nicely.

82
00:05:39,104 --> 00:05:41,104
What do you want to talk to me about?

83
00:05:47,167 --> 00:05:49,545
I just want to see you for the last time.

84
00:05:51,328 --> 00:05:53,328
The last time?

85
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,325
Where are you going?

86
00:06:03,473 --> 00:06:05,473
I’m here asking you something

87
00:06:06,434 --> 00:06:08,704
as a big brother who cares about his little brother.

88
00:06:08,704 --> 00:06:10,929
I asked where you’re going.

89
00:06:14,714 --> 00:06:16,941
Please don’t go back and see my friends again.

90
00:06:18,064 --> 00:06:20,064
Now they don’t listen to me at all.

91
00:06:20,064 --> 00:06:23,154
Everyone does things their own way.

92
00:06:23,154 --> 00:06:27,010
If it keeps going on like this, we’ll all be dead.

93
00:06:27,281 --> 00:06:30,173
I don’t want anything to happen to you.

94
00:06:30,173 --> 00:06:32,746
Just listen to me for once.

95
00:06:33,242 --> 00:06:37,203
You’re the only family member I have left.

96
00:06:38,589 --> 00:06:42,574
I don’t think I can take it if something happens to you.

97
00:06:47,304 --> 00:06:49,304
Please try to understand me.

98
00:06:49,304 --> 00:06:51,324
I’m begging you.

99
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,000
(Black never begged me for anything.)

100
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,381
(This time, he thinks the only way to save me and his friends

101
00:07:01,381 --> 00:07:04,040
is for me to leave everything behind,

102
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,392
including my love for Sean.)

103
00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:48,379
You’re not easy to find.

104
00:08:49,784 --> 00:08:51,784
Hey, where are you going?

105
00:09:12,373 --> 00:09:14,373
Where are you running away to?

106
00:09:14,373 --> 00:09:16,163
Quit running off already.

107
00:09:31,913 --> 00:09:33,913
Where are you running off to?

108
00:09:36,203 --> 00:09:38,203
To somewhere far away like I said.

109
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,279
Look at me closely

110
00:09:44,382 --> 00:09:46,382
and say it again.

111
00:09:46,631 --> 00:09:49,910
Say you truly want me to stay away from you.

112
00:10:00,732 --> 00:10:02,732
I know you can’t say it

113
00:10:03,009 --> 00:10:06,076
because you’re not the Black that hates me.

114
00:10:06,492 --> 00:10:09,361
You’re the Black that I have feelings for.

115
00:10:19,032 --> 00:10:21,032
I know you’re his twin.

116
00:10:22,197 --> 00:10:25,336
When are you going to stop lying to me?

117
00:10:27,406 --> 00:10:29,406
Let me go.

118
00:10:29,878 --> 00:10:32,042
What were you thinking to say that?

119
00:10:32,042 --> 00:10:33,522
Grab my hands.

120
00:10:50,357 --> 00:10:52,357
Where are you going now?

121
00:10:54,307 --> 00:10:56,369
Aren’t you going to say anything?

122
00:10:57,627 --> 00:11:01,280
You should at least tell me what your name is.

123
00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:05,358
White.

124
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,240
White?

125
00:11:14,622 --> 00:11:16,622
How did you figure it out?

126
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,580
I lived with you every day.

127
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:26,796
You just changed for a bit and I could feel it right away.

128
00:11:27,577 --> 00:11:28,920
Yeah?

129
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,849
Your feeling was pretty slow.

130
00:11:32,157 --> 00:11:34,157
I actually felt it a while ago.

131
00:11:34,157 --> 00:11:36,281
I just wasn’t sure.

132
00:11:37,331 --> 00:11:41,724
Besides you, who else knows?

133
00:11:42,114 --> 00:11:43,788
You’re so concerned with other people.

134
00:11:43,788 --> 00:11:45,678
You never cared about me.

135
00:11:45,678 --> 00:11:49,487
Do you have any idea how lost I was when Black acted like he hated me?

136
00:11:51,117 --> 00:11:53,117
I didn’t mean to lie to you.

137
00:11:53,117 --> 00:11:55,122
I did it because it was necessary.

138
00:11:55,122 --> 00:11:57,558
It’s necessary?

139
00:11:57,558 --> 00:12:00,803
You’re so selfish.

140
00:12:03,275 --> 00:12:05,275
If I hadn’t gotten involved in this,

141
00:12:06,686 --> 00:12:08,686
things wouldn’t have turned out this way.

142
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,368
But you had.

143
00:12:10,368 --> 00:12:12,391
You messed with everything.

144
00:12:12,391 --> 00:12:13,903
You messed with me.

145
00:12:14,686 --> 00:12:16,686
And now you decide to just disappear?

146
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,640
Come with me, White.

147
00:12:29,489 --> 00:12:32,207
Come back and tell everyone the truth.

148
00:12:33,341 --> 00:12:35,341
Tell them why you did it.

149
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:39,110
We’re all willing to understand you.

150
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:41,311
Just don’t disappear like this.

151
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,771
Don’t listen to Black.

152
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:57,130
Come with me, White.

153
00:12:59,061 --> 00:13:01,061
I’ll go to the warehouse tomorrow.

154
00:13:01,524 --> 00:13:03,524
I need you.

155
00:13:04,834 --> 00:13:07,959
You’re the one I want to go with the most.

156
00:13:11,685 --> 00:13:13,685
I’m sorry.

157
00:13:25,292 --> 00:13:27,292
If you don’t come with me,

158
00:13:29,848 --> 00:13:31,848
there’s something I need to ask from you.

159
00:13:35,464 --> 00:13:40,502
Do you remember you still owe me one wish?

160
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:49,135
From now on, don’t you ever show your face again.

161
00:13:51,186 --> 00:13:53,186
So I can get over you.

162
00:14:19,555 --> 00:14:22,682
I used to think it’s for the best if you’re with Black.

163
00:14:22,682 --> 00:14:25,495
But I’ve seen you get hurt because of him so many times.

164
00:14:25,621 --> 00:14:27,916
Can I take care of you instead?

165
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:29,916


166
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:08,428
Hey, Gram.

167
00:15:08,428 --> 00:15:09,846
How are you?

168
00:15:10,054 --> 00:15:11,482
Feeling better?

169
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:14,295
I guess I am.

170
00:15:14,754 --> 00:15:16,204
How are you doing?

171
00:15:16,204 --> 00:15:17,682
You seem a little depressed.

172
00:15:24,446 --> 00:15:26,446
You’re still keeping it?

173
00:15:28,323 --> 00:15:30,323
Yes. Do you want me to throw it away?

174
00:15:32,211 --> 00:15:34,711
I gave it to you ages ago and never saw you use it.

175
00:15:34,711 --> 00:15:36,867
Why are you using it now?

176
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,781
Hi, Gram.

177
00:15:50,781 --> 00:15:52,536
Here. It’s yours.

178
00:15:52,536 --> 00:15:54,472
I picked it up for you.

179
00:15:54,785 --> 00:15:57,393
What? You did?

180
00:15:57,576 --> 00:16:00,206
I thought they forgot about my order already.

181
00:16:01,546 --> 00:16:03,546
They sell many cute products there.

182
00:16:04,038 --> 00:16:05,955
I got one too.

183
00:16:06,543 --> 00:16:08,688
Hey, it matches mine.

184
00:16:08,688 --> 00:16:10,017
Look.

185
00:16:11,327 --> 00:16:12,702
B for Black.

186
00:16:14,236 --> 00:16:16,236
And G for Gene.

187
00:16:16,848 --> 00:16:18,119
Cute, huh?

188
00:16:18,119 --> 00:16:20,603
They’re custom-made, especially.

189
00:16:22,137 --> 00:16:24,137
Look.

190
00:16:27,314 --> 00:16:29,314
They’re cute.

191
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:32,039
Can I see yours?

192
00:16:34,108 --> 00:16:36,108
[I'm sorry for thinking of you as more than just a friend.]

193
00:16:36,108 --> 00:16:37,661
Let me see.

194
00:16:42,152 --> 00:16:43,506
That day,

195
00:16:43,506 --> 00:16:45,672
I wrote you a card.

196
00:16:46,716 --> 00:16:48,716
But I was too afraid to give it to you.

197
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,582
What card?

198
00:16:55,546 --> 00:16:57,546
I wrote down my feelings,

199
00:16:59,112 --> 00:17:01,112
saying I have a secret crush on you.

200
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:10,716
I used to think it’s for the best if you’re with Black.

201
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:13,321
But I’ve seen you get hurt because of him so many times.

202
00:17:14,881 --> 00:17:16,881
I don’t want to see you in pain.

203
00:17:17,767 --> 00:17:19,767
I don’t want anyone to hurt you anymore.

204
00:17:28,178 --> 00:17:30,178
Can I take care of you instead?

205
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,620
If you’re not ready, that’s okay.

206
00:17:37,258 --> 00:17:39,258
I can wait.

207
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,088
I have never danced with you, Gram.

208
00:18:04,706 --> 00:18:06,351
Shall we dance?

209
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:10,745
But…

210
00:18:11,737 --> 00:18:13,573
I don’t know how.

211
00:18:15,024 --> 00:18:17,024
What song are we dancing to?

212
00:18:17,482 --> 00:18:19,482
It’s not that hard.

213
00:18:23,283 --> 00:18:25,283
We dance to this rhythm.

214
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:30,716
So?

215
00:18:30,878 --> 00:18:32,400
Can you feel it?

216
00:18:34,303 --> 00:18:35,302
But…

217
00:18:35,844 --> 00:18:37,254
it’s beating fast.

218
00:18:37,254 --> 00:18:39,093
So we dance fast.

219
00:19:18,635 --> 00:19:20,010
Black?

220
00:19:37,553 --> 00:19:39,553
Is your business here done?

221
00:19:39,886 --> 00:19:41,886
I need to talk to Eugene.

222
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,106
Whatever it is, talk to me.

223
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:46,330
I was the one that hugged her.

224
00:19:47,272 --> 00:19:49,272
I’m not talking about that.

225
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:51,619
No need to have a guilty conscience.

226
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:56,375
Then you can just say it with me here.

227
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:57,514
Fine.

228
00:19:57,514 --> 00:19:59,515
If you’re sure you can stand it.

229
00:20:09,762 --> 00:20:11,762
This might be the last time we see each other.

230
00:20:14,385 --> 00:20:16,385
Can I get a hug?

231
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:21,327
Why are you talking like you’re committing suicide?

232
00:20:26,085 --> 00:20:28,085
You know me better than that.

233
00:20:30,864 --> 00:20:32,864
I just want to get the last hug from you

234
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:37,777
before I won’t get a chance.

235
00:20:39,235 --> 00:20:41,235
What is the matter with you?

236
00:20:42,238 --> 00:20:44,238
If you can’t take it, go outside.

237
00:21:11,082 --> 00:21:14,707
(The idea of not being able to see Sean anymore

238
00:21:14,707 --> 00:21:17,860
causes me so much pain right now.)

239
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:21,740
(It’s the suffering my brother will never understand

240
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:25,792
since he might have forgotten all about the connection we share.)

241
00:21:26,404 --> 00:21:29,646
(I might need to remind him again

242
00:21:29,646 --> 00:21:31,776
that we’re twin brothers.)

243
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:52,351
Hey, that’s enough.

244
00:23:04,922 --> 00:23:06,234
Black!

245
00:23:07,985 --> 00:23:08,860
Black.

246
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,429
What’s happening?

247
00:23:10,429 --> 00:23:11,300
Black.

248
00:23:23,292 --> 00:23:25,349
Black, what the f*ck are you doing?

249
00:23:25,349 --> 00:23:26,425
What’s happening?

250
00:23:42,862 --> 00:23:44,862
Black, are you in pain?

251
00:23:55,171 --> 00:23:56,254
Get up.

252
00:24:04,459 --> 00:24:06,459
I’m sorry for making you feel terrible.

253
00:24:08,046 --> 00:24:10,046
I will never come back to your life again.

254
00:24:12,655 --> 00:24:13,635
Hey!

255
00:24:14,272 --> 00:24:16,272
What’s wrong with you, Black?

256
00:24:18,962 --> 00:24:20,962
Where’s the redemption?

257
00:24:23,201 --> 00:24:25,201
Be dead just like my father.

258
00:24:25,284 --> 00:24:27,332
A life for a life.

259
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:29,332


260
00:25:19,837 --> 00:25:21,837
Trying to kill yourself?

261
00:25:22,422 --> 00:25:24,444
How did you get up here?

262
00:25:27,504 --> 00:25:29,504
Just climbed up.

263
00:25:31,214 --> 00:25:33,214
I thought someone did something to you.

264
00:25:33,746 --> 00:25:36,231
You decided to drown yourself to death?

265
00:25:36,406 --> 00:25:38,223
I wasn’t trying to kill myself.

266
00:25:40,629 --> 00:25:42,629
When you were drowning, I could feel it.

267
00:25:42,726 --> 00:25:46,736
Just like when we were kids.

268
00:25:54,251 --> 00:25:56,251
Why are we so much alike?

269
00:26:01,729 --> 00:26:03,729
Because I’m your little brother.

270
00:26:08,042 --> 00:26:10,042
There’s no way I can stop you, right?

271
00:26:15,731 --> 00:26:19,632
We both have been stubborn since we were young.

272
00:26:25,486 --> 00:26:29,911
After tonight, I don’t know if we will get to see each other again.

273
00:26:32,108 --> 00:26:34,108
Don’t say that.

274
00:26:34,108 --> 00:26:35,956
Nothing is going to happen to you.

275
00:26:37,473 --> 00:26:42,226
Promise me you will take good care of yourself.

276
00:26:43,997 --> 00:26:45,590
You too.

277
00:26:46,075 --> 00:26:47,938
Don’t die.

278
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,620
I will try.

279
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:56,715
If I can end Todd, we will see each other again.

280
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:04,162
I really can’t hold it.

281
00:27:05,036 --> 00:27:08,069
I don’t want anything bad to happen to you.

282
00:27:19,682 --> 00:27:21,682
I’m not crying.

283
00:27:21,863 --> 00:27:24,107
Tears are just running down my face.

284
00:27:24,696 --> 00:27:27,065
We truly are connected.

285
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:00,908
Hey.

286
00:28:08,999 --> 00:28:10,999
What is it?

287
00:28:17,954 --> 00:28:19,954
I have decided

288
00:28:21,289 --> 00:28:23,289
to tell you everything.

289
00:28:24,247 --> 00:28:26,247
What are you saying?

290
00:28:31,227 --> 00:28:33,746
I was the cop working on your father’s case.

291
00:28:37,675 --> 00:28:39,675
I missed a shot.

292
00:28:40,528 --> 00:28:42,528
I shot your father.

293
00:28:46,561 --> 00:28:47,785
I’m sorry.

294
00:28:48,581 --> 00:28:49,941
It’s my fault.

295
00:28:50,077 --> 00:28:51,994
Though it was an accident,

296
00:28:52,446 --> 00:28:54,522
it shouldn’t have happened.

297
00:28:56,238 --> 00:28:58,414
I never thought I’d get to see you again one day.

298
00:29:00,451 --> 00:29:04,850
I want to confess to you all the guilt I’m carrying.

299
00:29:09,855 --> 00:29:14,804
I’m willing to do anything to make amends.

300
00:29:21,631 --> 00:29:23,631
Hey, it’s loaded.

301
00:29:33,511 --> 00:29:35,511
You wanna pay?

302
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:43,125
Go on.

303
00:29:44,475 --> 00:29:46,688
A life for a life.

304
00:30:24,096 --> 00:30:25,262
Hey!

305
00:30:25,728 --> 00:30:27,503
What are you doing?

306
00:30:28,362 --> 00:30:30,362
What is it all about?

307
00:30:30,362 --> 00:30:32,044
Where’s the redemption?

308
00:30:32,044 --> 00:30:34,150
Be dead just like my father.

309
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,330
You told him?

310
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:42,267
You knew?

311
00:30:45,364 --> 00:30:47,364
I didn’t know it from the start.

312
00:30:47,364 --> 00:30:50,029
He’s trying his best to make it up to you.

313
00:30:50,029 --> 00:30:52,037
You knew it but you never told me.

314
00:30:52,037 --> 00:30:54,529
And you included this dickhead in our group.

315
00:30:57,227 --> 00:30:58,746
You’re all talk.

316
00:30:58,998 --> 00:31:01,154
Why didn’t you shoot?

317
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:02,455
Just die.

318
00:31:02,455 --> 00:31:04,558
That’s the justice for my dad.

319
00:31:06,123 --> 00:31:08,123
Pull yourself together.

320
00:31:09,265 --> 00:31:12,660
Do you really think an eye for an eye is the way to seek justice?

321
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:16,763
Then what are the laws for?

322
00:31:20,099 --> 00:31:22,099
If the laws can be our way out,

323
00:31:22,099 --> 00:31:24,124
we won’t be standing here.

324
00:31:24,318 --> 00:31:26,318
We are doing this

325
00:31:26,318 --> 00:31:27,804
because this shitty world is unfair.

326
00:31:27,804 --> 00:31:30,128
If you think what you’re doing is right,

327
00:31:30,128 --> 00:31:31,666
pick up the gun and shoot him then.

328
00:31:36,633 --> 00:31:37,760
Do it, Sean.

329
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,126
Once and for all.

330
00:31:46,814 --> 00:31:47,708
See?

331
00:31:48,017 --> 00:31:50,017
You can’t do it.

332
00:31:50,017 --> 00:31:52,422
Because you know what you’re doing isn’t right.

333
00:31:52,713 --> 00:31:54,866
If you want an eye for an eye,

334
00:31:54,866 --> 00:31:57,770
how about you use the Code of Hammurabi?

335
00:31:58,449 --> 00:32:01,594
Punish the ones who really did wrong.

336
00:32:02,384 --> 00:32:06,382
What you’re doing now isn’t even close to proving if he’s guilty.

337
00:32:06,892 --> 00:32:09,987
The Babylonian Empire is even more developed than your brain.

338
00:32:10,795 --> 00:32:12,795
What does justice mean to you anyway?

339
00:32:19,589 --> 00:32:23,898
To end the problem, you must first end your prejudice.

340
00:32:31,006 --> 00:32:31,978
Sean.

341
00:33:01,682 --> 00:33:03,042
Let go of me.

342
00:33:03,042 --> 00:33:05,068
I can’t let you risk your life all by yourself.

343
00:33:05,068 --> 00:33:08,563
You said it yourself that you shouldn’t get involved with this in the first place.

344
00:33:08,563 --> 00:33:10,563


345
00:34:10,092 --> 00:34:11,417
Sean,

346
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,373
are you going all by yourself?

347
00:34:13,373 --> 00:34:14,876
Aren’t you gonna wait for Black?

348
00:34:15,297 --> 00:34:18,321
It isn’t just him who can do this.

349
00:34:18,321 --> 00:34:20,174
But I never taught you to perform a one-man mission.

350
00:34:20,174 --> 00:34:22,743
You guys should help each other.

351
00:34:22,743 --> 00:34:27,171
If you don’t want me to go alone, I’ll talk to Gram and Yok.

352
00:34:27,171 --> 00:34:29,551
Those two specialize in making scenes.

353
00:34:29,551 --> 00:34:32,750
Only you and Black are perfect for sneaking in.

354
00:34:34,325 --> 00:34:36,066
This is my plan.

355
00:34:36,066 --> 00:34:37,985
Just let me go by myself.

356
00:34:41,061 --> 00:34:43,061
Good luck then.

357
00:35:07,935 --> 00:35:09,935
Why are you following me?

358
00:35:09,935 --> 00:35:11,738
I’m coming with you.

359
00:35:13,259 --> 00:35:15,259
Go away.

360
00:35:40,619 --> 00:35:41,503
Let go.

361
00:35:41,881 --> 00:35:43,422
Let go of me.

362
00:35:53,138 --> 00:35:56,097
I told you to never show your face again.

363
00:35:56,097 --> 00:35:58,039
I can’t let you risk your life all by yourself.

364
00:35:58,039 --> 00:35:59,499
Stay out of it.

365
00:35:59,499 --> 00:36:03,155
You said it yourself that you shouldn’t get involved in this in the first place.

366
00:36:07,807 --> 00:36:09,418
I was wrong.

367
00:36:10,297 --> 00:36:12,486
I thought I could walk away from you.

368
00:36:14,682 --> 00:36:16,682
I thought it wasn’t my place.

369
00:36:18,344 --> 00:36:20,344
But honestly,

370
00:36:21,389 --> 00:36:23,389
I can never go back to the way it was.

371
00:36:31,041 --> 00:36:33,041
I am sorry.

372
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,040
I want to walk with you.

373
00:36:44,009 --> 00:36:46,009
Accomplish goals together.

374
00:36:47,916 --> 00:36:49,916
Transform this society.

375
00:37:09,604 --> 00:37:11,604
You’re not disappearing on me again, are you?

376
00:38:00,721 --> 00:38:02,416
I’m not.

377
00:38:03,741 --> 00:38:05,741
I promise.

378
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,670
This way you can’t disappear.

379
00:38:26,823 --> 00:38:28,823
Let go.

380
00:38:29,289 --> 00:38:31,289
We can still work hand in hand.

381
00:38:48,804 --> 00:38:50,804
Got it.

382
00:39:14,326 --> 00:39:15,297
White, come here.

383
00:39:15,297 --> 00:39:17,758
I found the water heater.

384
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:32,870
Take photos.

385
00:39:40,854 --> 00:39:42,854
Someone’s coming. Put it back.

386
00:39:47,845 --> 00:39:48,890
Let’s go.

387
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:58,630
Are they gone?

388
00:40:06,365 --> 00:40:07,595
No.

389
00:40:07,595 --> 00:40:09,296
Stay like this a bit longer.

390
00:40:13,777 --> 00:40:15,777
You’re lying.

391
00:40:19,175 --> 00:40:21,175
Yes, I am.

392
00:40:21,673 --> 00:40:23,681
We’re done here. Let’s go.

393
00:40:23,681 --> 00:40:24,969
We can’t.

394
00:40:24,969 --> 00:40:27,232
We need an agreement here.

395
00:40:27,232 --> 00:40:29,090
What agreement?

396
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:31,839
You must tell everyone

397
00:40:32,101 --> 00:40:35,173
that you’re White, not Black.

398
00:40:40,663 --> 00:40:42,663
I’m not ready.

399
00:40:42,663 --> 00:40:45,103
I want this mission to be over first.

400
00:40:45,103 --> 00:40:47,080
You must be ready.

401
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:51,168
If you won’t do it, I will show myself right now.

402
00:40:52,202 --> 00:40:54,202
You won’t do that.

403
00:40:56,763 --> 00:40:58,268
I won’t.

404
00:40:59,672 --> 00:41:02,345
But I want you to tell the truth.

405
00:41:02,345 --> 00:41:04,261
Whether it’s now or later,

406
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:06,245
the truth is the truth.

407
00:41:12,113 --> 00:41:14,113
Take as much time as you need to think.

408
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:20,910
And if I won’t do it?

409
00:41:22,548 --> 00:41:24,548
If you won’t,

410
00:41:24,803 --> 00:41:27,240
we will stay here all day long.

411
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:31,180
Did you plan this?

412
00:41:31,439 --> 00:41:32,985
Yes.

413
00:41:33,141 --> 00:41:35,297
Now what?

414
00:41:35,297 --> 00:41:37,531
Will you say it or not?

415
00:41:38,858 --> 00:41:40,872
Staying here is quite nice.

416
00:41:40,872 --> 00:41:42,388
It’s exciting.

417
00:41:42,388 --> 00:41:45,297
(I know exactly what Sean wants.)

418
00:41:45,297 --> 00:41:47,717
(Making me confess to everyone

419
00:41:47,717 --> 00:41:52,664
is like closing all the doors I might use to run away from him again.)

420
00:41:57,191 --> 00:41:59,191
Fine. I’ll do it, asshole.

421
00:42:18,054 --> 00:42:19,483
Why are you together now?

422
00:42:19,483 --> 00:42:20,968
Are you two cool?

423
00:42:21,362 --> 00:42:23,380
We’re cool.

424
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:24,752
What’s up with you guys?

425
00:42:24,752 --> 00:42:26,752
You keep fighting and making up.

426
00:42:27,364 --> 00:42:29,364
Did you get the photos, Sean?

427
00:42:29,935 --> 00:42:31,648
We did.

428
00:42:43,195 --> 00:42:44,209
Guys,

429
00:42:44,831 --> 00:42:47,178
I have something important to say.

430
00:42:47,178 --> 00:42:50,556
A guy standing next to me isn’t Black.

431
00:42:53,838 --> 00:42:55,838
What the heck are you playing now?

432
00:43:01,208 --> 00:43:03,208
I’m White,

433
00:43:03,338 --> 00:43:05,495
Black’s twin brother.

434
00:43:09,496 --> 00:43:11,081
What are you saying?

435
00:43:11,081 --> 00:43:13,269
Is this some kind of a test again?

436
00:43:15,284 --> 00:43:16,661
You’re so dramatic.

437
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:17,929
Your plot fails.

438
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:19,004
What’s your name again?

439
00:43:19,004 --> 00:43:19,813
White?

440
00:43:19,813 --> 00:43:21,645
White and Black, like the colors?

441
00:43:25,727 --> 00:43:27,156
What are you doing?

442
00:43:27,156 --> 00:43:28,937
You guys started this play first.

443
00:43:28,937 --> 00:43:30,720
We’re not playing. I’m telling the truth.

444
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,282
Drop it already.

445
00:43:32,282 --> 00:43:33,380
We told you the truth.

446
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:37,805
(I was afraid to lose these friends when the truth came out.)

447
00:43:37,805 --> 00:43:44,072
(It turns out I need to spend quite some time explaining everything until they believe me.)

448
00:43:54,697 --> 00:43:56,697
Quit doubting already.

449
00:43:57,903 --> 00:43:59,903
Are these really your photos?

450
00:44:01,836 --> 00:44:03,836
Why would I lie to you?

451
00:44:03,836 --> 00:44:05,037
You’re right.

452
00:44:05,037 --> 00:44:07,080
He has a different hairstyle than Black’s.

453
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:08,280
His eyes are different too.

454
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,763
White’s eyes are bigger.

455
00:44:09,763 --> 00:44:11,579
Black likes to give harsh gazes.

456
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:13,713
Stop staring at him.

457
00:44:13,713 --> 00:44:16,111
What? I just want to see the differences.

458
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:17,915
Come to think of it, they’re quite different.

459
00:44:17,915 --> 00:44:19,679
Why couldn’t I tell them apart?

460
00:44:19,679 --> 00:44:22,036
Yeah, I kind of had the weird feeling.

461
00:44:22,036 --> 00:44:24,336
But who would have thought Black has a twin brother?

462
00:44:24,336 --> 00:44:26,708
That’s why you guys need to be more observant.

463
00:44:26,708 --> 00:44:29,273
I knew it all along but I didn’t say a thing to anyone.

464
00:44:29,999 --> 00:44:31,137
Are you bragging now?

465
00:44:31,137 --> 00:44:32,986
I’m not.

466
00:44:32,986 --> 00:44:35,137
I believed he had his reason to join us.

467
00:44:35,137 --> 00:44:37,782
So I just watched him from the distance and didn’t say anything.

468
00:44:39,094 --> 00:44:41,094
Definitely bragging.

469
00:44:41,458 --> 00:44:42,343
Let’s see.

470
00:44:42,343 --> 00:44:44,545
Which other parts are you different than Black?

471
00:44:45,337 --> 00:44:46,844
No need to touch him.

472
00:44:46,844 --> 00:44:47,918
What?

473
00:44:47,918 --> 00:44:49,239
Jealous?

474
00:44:49,239 --> 00:44:50,959
Are you a jealous dog?

475
00:44:52,088 --> 00:44:53,491
Yes, I am.

476
00:44:53,491 --> 00:44:56,282
I’m a jealous dog.

477
00:44:56,282 --> 00:44:57,465
What are you doing?

478
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
You’re not like this when it’s just the two of us.

479
00:45:04,113 --> 00:45:06,113
What do you do when you’re alone together?

480
00:45:25,835 --> 00:45:27,835
How are you feeling

481
00:45:27,835 --> 00:45:30,443
now that you have confessed?

482
00:45:32,537 --> 00:45:34,537
So relieved.

483
00:45:35,613 --> 00:45:38,327
When Yok splashed water at me,

484
00:45:39,157 --> 00:45:41,272
why didn’t you protect me?

485
00:45:41,272 --> 00:45:43,111
Because you deserved that.

486
00:45:43,694 --> 00:45:45,738
You’d lied to me for so long.

487
00:45:45,738 --> 00:45:47,178
Consider it your punishment.

488
00:45:48,993 --> 00:45:50,993
Does my hair smell bad?

489
00:45:56,478 --> 00:45:59,075
It does but I like it.

490
00:46:02,656 --> 00:46:04,656
Now that you’re back to being White,

491
00:46:04,656 --> 00:46:06,510
are you also back to using all your stuff?

492
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:08,977
I can see the dissimilarity.

493
00:46:08,977 --> 00:46:10,792
Am I that different?

494
00:46:14,369 --> 00:46:16,369
Which version do you prefer?

495
00:46:17,985 --> 00:46:19,985
Me as White

496
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:22,689
or me as Black?

497
00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:25,890
I don’t know.

498
00:46:27,896 --> 00:46:29,896
It doesn’t matter how you look.

499
00:46:31,414 --> 00:46:33,414
All I know is that

500
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:39,676
I don’t want this person in front of me to disappear again.

501
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:45,119
Stay with me.

502
00:47:05,830 --> 00:47:07,830
Directed by Anucha Boonyawatana

503
00:47:09,794 --> 00:47:11,093
If he comes in today,

504
00:47:11,093 --> 00:47:14,272
we will go all out.

505
00:47:14,914 --> 00:47:16,501
Don’t harm them.

506
00:47:16,501 --> 00:47:17,958
It’s their right to protest.

507
00:47:17,958 --> 00:47:19,170
Are you sure?

508
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:20,861
Tawi has everything under control.

509
00:47:20,861 --> 00:47:21,871
Not everything.

510
00:47:21,871 --> 00:47:23,297
More people are against him now.

511
00:47:23,297 --> 00:47:25,433
Sean, they’re moving the goods.

512
00:47:26,669 --> 00:47:28,200
There are cops up ahead.

513
00:47:28,771 --> 00:47:29,304
Shit!

514
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:31,673
If we get caught, we become drug smugglers.

515
00:47:31,673 --> 00:47:33,696
I think we’ve been betrayed.
