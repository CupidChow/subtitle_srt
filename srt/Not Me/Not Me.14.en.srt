Viewer discretion is advised.

4
00:01:31,363 --> 00:01:33,363
We will go down to the 6th floor and use the fire exit.

5
00:01:33,829 --> 00:01:35,200
Yok, can you handle that?

6
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:35,926
Hang in there.

7
00:01:35,926 --> 00:01:36,539
I can.

8
00:01:36,539 --> 00:01:37,039
Come on.

9
00:01:54,437 --> 00:01:56,648
Listen to me carefully, Gram.

10
00:01:57,452 --> 00:01:59,217
You take Yok to the 2nd floor.

11
00:01:59,217 --> 00:02:00,516
I think there are police on the first floor.

12
00:02:00,836 --> 00:02:03,846
Once you reach the 2nd floor, go to the left-wing of this building.

13
00:02:03,846 --> 00:02:05,141
There’s a way to escape.

14
00:02:05,661 --> 00:02:07,520
I saw it when Yok was in the operation.

15
00:02:07,788 --> 00:02:08,662
Now, go.

16
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:09,788
I’ll wait for the others.

17
00:02:10,623 --> 00:02:12,670
If we get caught, we all get caught together, damn it!

18
00:02:13,369 --> 00:02:14,225
Now move.

19
00:02:15,211 --> 00:02:15,909
Hurry.

20
00:02:19,371 --> 00:02:21,371
Gram, don’t forget, the 2nd floor.

21
00:02:29,148 --> 00:02:30,138
You go ahead.

22
00:02:30,309 --> 00:02:32,960
I will lure the police out front away.

23
00:02:33,082 --> 00:02:34,096
Just go together.

24
00:02:34,832 --> 00:02:35,869
We can’t go together.

25
00:02:36,193 --> 00:02:38,669
I was capable of getting in. I’m capable of getting out.

26
00:02:38,861 --> 00:02:40,000
Don’t do this.

27
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:47,534
Do as I said.

28
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:51,884
Go.

29
00:02:53,752 --> 00:02:57,161
I hate listening to what he says but we should move now as he told us.

30
00:02:57,818 --> 00:02:58,478
Let’s go.

31
00:02:58,830 --> 00:02:59,489
Sean.

32
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,585
Take care of my little brother.

33
00:03:08,693 --> 00:03:09,872
Come.

34
00:03:09,872 --> 00:03:10,693
Follow me.

35
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:11,680
White.

36
00:05:13,222 --> 00:05:13,862
Freeze!

37
00:05:14,432 --> 00:05:15,440
Put down your weapon.

38
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:16,892
Put it down.

39
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,104
Slowly.

40
00:05:19,104 --> 00:05:19,806
Put it down.

41
00:05:20,001 --> 00:05:20,844
Turn around.

42
00:05:21,127 --> 00:05:23,127
Turn around.

43
00:05:23,733 --> 00:05:25,101
Turn around. Slowly.

44
00:05:36,267 --> 00:05:36,913
Freeze!

45
00:05:37,406 --> 00:05:38,267
Stop.

46
00:05:38,634 --> 00:05:39,256
Don’t move.

47
00:05:40,404 --> 00:05:41,280
hands up.

48
00:05:42,215 --> 00:05:43,980
I said freeze!

49
00:05:45,426 --> 00:05:46,557
Let’s have a chat.

50
00:06:02,221 --> 00:06:03,164
Unit 2, stand by.

51
00:06:03,164 --> 00:06:04,221
The guy just ran away.

52
00:06:04,314 --> 00:06:05,422
He’s using the fire exit.

53
00:06:06,339 --> 00:06:07,118
Copy that.

54
00:06:34,007 --> 00:06:35,819
Sir, how can I help?

55
00:06:36,794 --> 00:06:38,442
Sir, who are you here for?

56
00:06:41,508 --> 00:06:42,246
Let’s go, guys.

57
00:06:55,443 --> 00:06:56,799
Sean, White, take Yok away.

58
00:07:05,711 --> 00:07:06,272
Hey!

59
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,758
Stop!

60
00:07:16,308 --> 00:07:17,760
Or I’ll blow your friend’s head off.

61
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:19,698
Capture them.

62
00:07:20,144 --> 00:07:20,840
Run!

63
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,123
Just run.

64
00:07:23,812 --> 00:07:24,750
Get them.

65
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,140
Put them in the van.

66
00:07:32,681 --> 00:07:33,563
It hurts.

67
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,038
Where are you taking us?

68
00:07:35,315 --> 00:07:35,877
Yok.

69
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:37,920
Somewhere nobody finds you.

70
00:07:37,963 --> 00:07:39,540
So the cops are working with you.

71
00:07:39,711 --> 00:07:41,335
The cops are doing their job.

72
00:07:42,424 --> 00:07:43,381
But I’m not a cop.

73
00:07:43,616 --> 00:07:44,776
I don’t need to do things by law.

74
00:07:45,967 --> 00:07:48,765
My job is to make you all vanish.

75
00:08:10,579 --> 00:08:11,640
Stop right there!

76
00:08:22,489 --> 00:08:23,472
Freeze!

77
00:08:23,613 --> 00:08:24,818
Freeze!

78
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:25,858
Freeze!

79
00:08:40,035 --> 00:08:40,738
Guys,

80
00:08:42,194 --> 00:08:42,904
listen.

81
00:08:43,683 --> 00:08:45,096
When I’m done counting, we all kick the door open.

82
00:08:46,289 --> 00:08:46,993
1

83
00:08:47,557 --> 00:08:48,057
2.

84
00:08:48,057 --> 00:08:48,853
Kick!

85
00:08:50,471 --> 00:08:51,030
1

86
00:08:51,758 --> 00:08:52,288
2

87
00:08:52,288 --> 00:08:53,011
Kick!

88
00:08:56,922 --> 00:08:58,066
Shit!

89
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,131
I can’t move.

90
00:09:03,069 --> 00:09:05,069
Ouch!

91
00:09:05,069 --> 00:09:05,708
Yok,

92
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,103
Be still. Don’t kick.

93
00:09:11,589 --> 00:09:12,481
You don’t kick.

94
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:13,824
Are you okay?

95
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:15,416
Yok?

96
00:09:19,112 --> 00:09:20,000
Yok

97
00:09:21,057 --> 00:09:22,047
Goddamn it!

98
00:09:25,701 --> 00:09:26,997
Where do you think they’re taking us?

99
00:09:28,474 --> 00:09:30,474
A river or a mountain?

100
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:39,893
What are they going to do to us?

101
00:09:42,111 --> 00:09:45,708
Probably push us down the mountain or drown us in the river.

102
00:09:47,088 --> 00:09:48,501
Or maybe burn us alive.

103
00:09:52,396 --> 00:09:54,396
They have guns. Why don’t they just shoot us?

104
00:09:58,599 --> 00:09:59,448
Damn!

105
00:10:01,107 --> 00:10:03,107
Dealing with bodies isn't something simple, Sean.

106
00:10:19,123 --> 00:10:19,735
Yok.

107
00:10:22,013 --> 00:10:23,166
Are you okay?

108
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,709
If I die,

109
00:10:29,643 --> 00:10:31,338
my mom will eventually get over it.

110
00:10:33,524 --> 00:10:35,266
But if I just disappear,

111
00:10:39,103 --> 00:10:41,244
that’s too cruel to her.

112
00:10:50,288 --> 00:10:52,147
Why is it so easy for them to make us disappear?

113
00:10:53,983 --> 00:10:55,227
Now that it’s really happening,

114
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,510
it just hurts so damn bad.

115
00:11:12,979 --> 00:11:14,208
If you want to cry,

116
00:11:15,687 --> 00:11:16,904
do it now.

117
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:20,333
But you must promise me.

118
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:23,985
Once we get off this van,

119
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:28,390
don’t you cry in front of them.

120
00:11:30,379 --> 00:11:31,745
Because we didn’t lose.

121
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:37,605
I promise.

122
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:29,581
If we can deal with their leaders,

123
00:12:29,581 --> 00:12:31,399
everything will be easier.

124
00:12:31,545 --> 00:12:32,441
Tawi.

125
00:12:32,441 --> 00:12:33,519
Get out!

126
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,217
Tawi.

127
00:12:34,217 --> 00:12:35,259
Get out!

128
00:12:57,428 --> 00:12:59,428
Citizens!

129
00:13:00,784 --> 00:13:03,577
This is the walk of change.

130
00:13:04,523 --> 00:13:07,316
It’s the walk for justice.

131
00:13:08,561 --> 00:13:09,168
Okay.

132
00:13:09,168 --> 00:13:13,802
Protests may come and go.

133
00:13:14,009 --> 00:13:17,385
If we don’t respond with violence,

134
00:13:17,616 --> 00:13:19,079
they will eventually go home.

135
00:13:19,939 --> 00:13:26,442
Please reassure him that there is nothing to be concerned about in this circumstance.

136
00:13:26,829 --> 00:13:30,625
I have everything completely under control. All right?

137
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:32,277
Citizens!

138
00:13:32,842 --> 00:13:34,122
Will you fight or not?

139
00:13:34,122 --> 00:13:34,830
We will!

140
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:38,224
If we can deal with their leaders,

141
00:13:38,224 --> 00:13:40,675
everything will be easier.

142
00:13:40,824 --> 00:13:46,442
- Tawi.
- Get out!

143
00:13:46,802 --> 00:13:48,452
The way I see it,

144
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:49,954
this will be over in less than a week.

145
00:13:50,923 --> 00:13:53,226
Unless there are new elements occurring in between.

146
00:13:53,697 --> 00:13:57,330
I highly hope that won’t happen.

147
00:14:07,173 --> 00:14:08,310
What is going on down there?

148
00:14:08,486 --> 00:14:09,623
What are they asking for?

149
00:14:10,357 --> 00:14:13,482
They are asking for you to get out, sir.

150
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:17,558
And there's a fuss on social media about…

151
00:14:20,064 --> 00:14:21,854
you kidnapping people.

152
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:24,761
Take a look, sir.

153
00:14:26,827 --> 00:14:29,037
There are several protests going on now.

154
00:14:29,629 --> 00:14:32,282
[Look for this vehicle. We heard some people are being abducted by Tawi!!]

155
00:14:37,266 --> 00:14:39,079
Take care of the news.

156
00:14:39,543 --> 00:14:40,852
Tell them I have nothing to do with this.

157
00:14:40,852 --> 00:14:41,823
This is not my doing.

158
00:14:42,096 --> 00:14:43,396
Yes, sir.

159
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:09,990
What the hell?

160
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:11,982
Mr. Techit, I don’t think we can go on.

161
00:15:19,076 --> 00:15:20,362
Keep honking and shoo them away.

162
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:21,625
Hey,

163
00:15:22,348 --> 00:15:23,306
where are you going?

164
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:24,682
Hey!

165
00:15:24,902 --> 00:15:25,572
Hey!

166
00:15:30,632 --> 00:15:42,127
Release our friends!

167
00:15:46,894 --> 00:15:58,225
Release our friends!

168
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:42,130
ROL!

169
00:17:45,341 --> 00:17:46,385
Brothers and sisters!

170
00:17:46,672 --> 00:17:53,408
We will not let those guys proceed like this is some uncivilized and unlawful country.

171
00:17:53,408 --> 00:17:53,966
Right?

172
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:54,957
Right!

173
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:56,907
They are innocent people.

174
00:17:57,072 --> 00:18:03,597
If not, let them fight and prove themselves under the judgment process.

175
00:18:03,986 --> 00:18:06,243
No more enforced disappearance.

176
00:18:06,434 --> 00:18:09,320
This is not justice.

177
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,168
Right!

178
00:18:11,553 --> 00:18:12,640
Namo.

179
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,673
You okay?

180
00:18:14,673 --> 00:18:15,461
Sit down.

181
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:19,557
Sit down.

182
00:18:21,736 --> 00:18:23,736
I should have known it was you guys.

183
00:18:24,367 --> 00:18:26,204
You did ask me about heroes and vigilantes.

184
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:29,333
Yok, stay here.

185
00:18:30,795 --> 00:18:31,878
Namo, help keep an eye on him.

186
00:18:32,065 --> 00:18:32,749
Sure.

187
00:18:37,455 --> 00:18:39,012
Are you all right?

188
00:18:39,158 --> 00:18:40,033
What happened to you?

189
00:18:41,158 --> 00:18:42,003
I am.

190
00:18:42,822 --> 00:18:44,402
Gumpa is getting me an ambulance.

191
00:18:45,044 --> 00:18:46,280
Good then.

192
00:18:49,102 --> 00:18:49,866
Namo.

193
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:50,483
Hm.

194
00:18:51,844 --> 00:18:52,864
I’m wondering

195
00:18:55,094 --> 00:18:57,094
if art can really unlock people.

196
00:19:00,066 --> 00:19:00,853
It sure can.

197
00:19:01,055 --> 00:19:03,218
Your friend hurt my feelings.

198
00:19:03,218 --> 00:19:05,218
I kept drawing and painting and got better in no time.

199
00:19:07,381 --> 00:19:08,588
If you need any help, let me know.

200
00:19:09,942 --> 00:19:11,056
Thanks.

201
00:19:12,135 --> 00:19:13,322
You sure you’re okay?

202
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:14,273
I am.

203
00:19:16,723 --> 00:19:17,605
I am.

204
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:19,750
Thank you so much.

205
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,940
Without you, we wouldn’t have come this far.

206
00:19:28,779 --> 00:19:34,278
The ones you should thank are the people and yourself.

207
00:19:35,672 --> 00:19:40,751
Do you realize how much courage they need to fight against those powerful people?

208
00:19:44,939 --> 00:19:46,449
You are complimenting me.

209
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:48,773
What do you want in return?

210
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,264
What can you offer?

211
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:58,825
That’s it?

212
00:19:59,502 --> 00:20:00,616
I can give you more.

213
00:20:01,262 --> 00:20:02,026
Can I get it now?

214
00:20:02,399 --> 00:20:02,982
Hey!

215
00:20:06,312 --> 00:20:07,402


216
00:20:18,641 --> 00:20:20,804
Thank you for saving us, Nuch.

217
00:20:21,633 --> 00:20:24,100
Did you have any idea how risky what you did was?

218
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:26,839
I was worried sick, you know?

219
00:20:28,105 --> 00:20:28,869
Alright.

220
00:20:29,499 --> 00:20:31,202
Yell at me all you want.

221
00:20:31,652 --> 00:20:36,638
Because in class, you always battle with me, argue with me, and side with them anyway.

222
00:20:36,918 --> 00:20:38,335
I don’t side with them.

223
00:20:38,829 --> 00:20:40,642
I was just referencing the law.

224
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:46,729
What you did can get you sued for property trespassing and vandalism.

225
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,251
Gram,

226
00:20:50,718 --> 00:20:52,694
the law is just the law.

227
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:55,627
It’s only the gate to justice.

228
00:20:56,465 --> 00:20:58,762
But the law itself isn’t justice.

229
00:20:59,971 --> 00:21:03,557
What you are fighting for, I do respect that.

230
00:21:07,215 --> 00:21:08,151
Thank you, Nuch.

231
00:21:09,107 --> 00:21:10,171
After this,

232
00:21:10,821 --> 00:21:12,821
if you are sued or whatever,

233
00:21:13,655 --> 00:21:15,422
I'll always be there to help you.

234
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:18,077
Men are all like this.

235
00:21:18,346 --> 00:21:19,600
They always get me wrong.

236
00:21:20,151 --> 00:21:21,334
I’m so fed up.

237
00:21:21,334 --> 00:21:22,771
Always come up with troubles.

238
00:21:25,203 --> 00:21:26,340
Oh, come on.

239
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:29,962
Eugene is here too.

240
00:21:30,877 --> 00:21:32,294
She’s at the first aid unit.

241
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:34,326
You should go see her.

242
00:21:36,842 --> 00:21:38,005
Will you excuse me then?

243
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:39,480
See you at the uni.

244
00:21:48,105 --> 00:21:49,139
Gene, you’re here too?

245
00:21:49,886 --> 00:21:50,899
Hey, Gram.

246
00:21:52,093 --> 00:21:53,284
I have something to say to you.

247
00:21:54,357 --> 00:21:55,049
Sure.

248
00:21:56,372 --> 00:21:57,276
Excuse me for a moment.

249
00:22:02,828 --> 00:22:03,737
What’s up?

250
00:22:04,469 --> 00:22:08,335
It must have been clear to you now what my friends and I are doing.

251
00:22:09,198 --> 00:22:12,154
And you know Black has a twin brother, right?

252
00:22:14,048 --> 00:22:15,581
I met White just now.

253
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:19,015
I don’t want to be full of myself.

254
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:22,039
I don’t know if you still love Black.

255
00:22:28,011 --> 00:22:29,894
When I realized I was about to get killed,

256
00:22:30,616 --> 00:22:31,963
your face flashed across my mind.

257
00:22:34,942 --> 00:22:37,782
It’d be such a shame if we didn’t get to see each other again.

258
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,977
What I did has consequences.

259
00:22:44,274 --> 00:22:45,924
I think I might be locked up in prison.

260
00:22:47,767 --> 00:22:49,207
You might need to go visit me in prison.

261
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:52,780
So I just wanted to ask

262
00:22:55,353 --> 00:22:57,143
if you’re okay to be with a man like me.

263
00:23:02,721 --> 00:23:03,522
We’re over.

264
00:23:03,942 --> 00:23:05,024
Don’t waste your time on me.

265
00:23:07,084 --> 00:23:08,249
Black, why?

266
00:23:08,249 --> 00:23:08,842
Black!

267
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:11,051
Do you still love me, Black?

268
00:23:11,245 --> 00:23:13,548
Drink up and I’ll let you know.

269
00:23:13,964 --> 00:23:15,357
I want to stop thinking things in my head.

270
00:23:15,463 --> 00:23:16,682
I want clarification.

271
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:24,352
This might be the last time we see each other.

272
00:23:24,464 --> 00:23:26,464
I will never come back to your life again.

273
00:23:28,451 --> 00:23:31,477
I promise I won’t hurt you like you’ve been hurt before.

274
00:23:32,808 --> 00:23:35,202
If you said that just to make me feel better,

275
00:23:35,857 --> 00:23:37,460
don’t bother.

276
00:23:37,991 --> 00:23:39,384
I like it when you smile.

277
00:23:42,055 --> 00:23:43,868
Can I be the one that makes you smile every day?

278
00:23:48,219 --> 00:23:49,892
Say no more.

279
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:54,122
I don’t want you to go anywhere.

280
00:23:57,003 --> 00:23:58,886
I want you to be the reason I smile often.

281
00:23:59,663 --> 00:24:00,884
Just like you said.

282
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,183
I’m giving you the chance.

283
00:24:34,601 --> 00:24:35,723
Don’t blow it.

284
00:24:36,306 --> 00:24:37,021
Got it?

285
00:24:40,009 --> 00:24:40,983
I love you.

286
00:24:55,408 --> 00:24:56,638
Can I get a hug?

287
00:24:58,491 --> 00:25:00,202
Do you remember

288
00:25:01,985 --> 00:25:05,642
I asked if you liked to kiss with your eyes closed or open?

289
00:25:30,812 --> 00:25:33,663
(After that day, Black never returns.)

290
00:25:34,425 --> 00:25:39,758
(Deep down, I know he’ll let me know when he wants to see me.)

291
00:25:49,667 --> 00:25:50,473
Found him?

292
00:25:50,979 --> 00:25:51,736
No.

293
00:25:52,777 --> 00:25:54,869
Are you sure he will show up there?

294
00:25:56,562 --> 00:25:57,460
I don’t know.

295
00:25:58,127 --> 00:25:59,390
I can’t reach him.

296
00:26:04,539 --> 00:26:05,549
Don’t stress out.

297
00:26:05,779 --> 00:26:06,585
Just drink this.

298
00:26:17,921 --> 00:26:18,681
Drink up.

299
00:26:23,508 --> 00:26:24,546
It’s nice and frizzy.

300
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,946
Don’t worry about him.

301
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:28,448
Black is smart.

302
00:26:28,657 --> 00:26:30,243
Of course, he can survive.

303
00:26:34,404 --> 00:26:35,530
I know that.

304
00:26:37,229 --> 00:26:38,447
I know he’s okay.

305
00:26:40,734 --> 00:26:42,458
We have a special connection.

306
00:26:44,419 --> 00:26:45,661
If something happens to him,

307
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:47,729
I will feel it.

308
00:26:49,169 --> 00:26:52,020
Do you recall our motorbike accident?

309
00:26:53,115 --> 00:26:54,786
I just collapsed all of a sudden.

310
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,019
That was when Black got hurt by Todd.

311
00:27:01,684 --> 00:27:03,408
I felt the pain he was experiencing.

312
00:27:05,226 --> 00:27:06,238
Seriously?

313
00:27:06,794 --> 00:27:08,226
You don’t have a twin brother, you wouldn’t know.

314
00:27:08,662 --> 00:27:10,133
I do know.

315
00:27:10,926 --> 00:27:12,650
I’ve been living with you two for so long.

316
00:27:13,354 --> 00:27:14,635
If Black is back,

317
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:16,826
I can surely tell you guys apart.

318
00:27:19,857 --> 00:27:21,604
I don’t think he will join this group again.

319
00:27:27,571 --> 00:27:28,629
What made you think so?

320
00:27:35,065 --> 00:27:35,747
Sean,

321
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,364
nobody wants to live in someone else’s shadow.

322
00:27:41,546 --> 00:27:43,776
My brother sacrificed this role for me.

323
00:27:44,836 --> 00:27:46,744
Then he may find the way

324
00:27:48,545 --> 00:27:50,085
that really belongs to his true self.

325
00:28:05,262 --> 00:28:07,009
Tonight is going to be the last night.

326
00:28:08,373 --> 00:28:09,604
Give me a hug.

327
00:28:12,041 --> 00:28:13,155
Why last night?

328
00:28:13,991 --> 00:28:15,922
We have come so far.

329
00:28:16,523 --> 00:28:18,063
I don’t think we can hide anymore.

330
00:28:18,764 --> 00:28:21,339
I can see that everyone stands up and fights.

331
00:28:22,565 --> 00:28:23,852
I’m ready to fight this case.

332
00:28:25,024 --> 00:28:26,426
But you have to be right by my side.

333
00:28:43,703 --> 00:28:45,626
We just went through a life-or-death situation.

334
00:28:46,487 --> 00:28:48,386
Yet you can think of this stuff?

335
00:28:48,788 --> 00:28:51,593
I’m afriad I wouldn’t see you again when I wake up tomorrow.

336
00:28:57,827 --> 00:28:58,467
Ouch!

337
00:28:59,616 --> 00:29:00,378
Are you turned on?

338
00:29:01,955 --> 00:29:02,990
What if I am?

339
00:29:03,284 --> 00:29:05,281
So?

340
00:29:06,226 --> 00:29:07,123
Hey!

341
00:29:08,811 --> 00:29:09,932
Getting back at me, huh?

342
00:29:11,518 --> 00:29:12,397
Come here.

343
00:29:23,764 --> 00:29:25,419
Do you remember what I asked you?

344
00:29:27,733 --> 00:29:31,266
I asked if you liked to kiss with your eyes closed or open.

345
00:29:32,062 --> 00:29:32,790
I do.

346
00:29:34,583 --> 00:29:35,418
I lied.

347
00:29:36,739 --> 00:29:37,911
I like to kiss with my eyes open

348
00:29:39,479 --> 00:29:41,318
because it’s the special angle only I get to see.

349
00:29:42,933 --> 00:29:44,395
And now can I open my eyes too?

350
00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:46,151
Yes.

351
00:29:52,932 --> 00:29:54,127
Why are you so damn cute?

352
00:29:57,495 --> 00:29:58,484
You like to touch me, huh?

353
00:29:59,861 --> 00:30:00,758
You do?

354
00:30:01,121 --> 00:30:02,385
You like that?

355
00:30:10,835 --> 00:30:17,478
The protestors are demanding for the police to investigate Tawi Kuerkulsvasti and all of his companies

356
00:30:17,478 --> 00:30:23,050
as they believe he is engaged in large-scale narcotics trafficking and the kidnapping of a group of college students known as ROL.

357
00:30:23,207 --> 00:30:26,770
Techit, his wingman, was arrested three weeks ago...

358
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:27,613
Aren’t you going to work?

359
00:30:31,795 --> 00:30:33,026
Okay. Bye then.

360
00:30:33,026 --> 00:30:37,745
The ROL students, who previously turned themselves in, were out temporarily on bail yesterday with high degree probation.

361
00:30:37,745 --> 00:30:38,288
Bye.

362
00:30:38,288 --> 00:30:45,398
One of the students expressed gratitude to all citizens who are now using the hashtag #notme #notyou #buteveryone.

363
00:31:14,681 --> 00:31:15,868
What’s up, Yok?

364
00:31:17,753 --> 00:31:18,566
Gumpa.

365
00:31:27,684 --> 00:31:29,316
Here. A gift from my mom.

366
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,030
Tell her I said thanks.

367
00:31:34,906 --> 00:31:35,701
How is she doing?

368
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,032
Good.

369
00:31:39,832 --> 00:31:41,832
She got a new job at a small juice bar.

370
00:31:43,371 --> 00:31:44,383
Her employer is very nice too.

371
00:31:44,866 --> 00:31:46,306
I’m happy for her.

372
00:31:47,879 --> 00:31:48,891
Thank you, Gumpa.

373
00:31:53,323 --> 00:31:54,564
What are you going to do next?

374
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,506
People in my generation never won.

375
00:31:58,858 --> 00:32:01,640
All I can do is encourage the new generation to fight along.

376
00:32:02,782 --> 00:32:03,908
So you want to continue?

377
00:32:04,271 --> 00:32:05,626
Until we win.

378
00:32:07,136 --> 00:32:10,147
But we have already come way further than we expected.

379
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:12,652
I’m not quite satisfied yet.

380
00:32:13,188 --> 00:32:14,935
I actually hope for more.

381
00:32:16,189 --> 00:32:16,948
Um.

382
00:32:21,864 --> 00:32:22,606
Gumpa,

383
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:24,990
do you think people can really change?

384
00:32:28,782 --> 00:32:29,679
I believe so.

385
00:32:30,749 --> 00:32:32,933
I believe everyone is capable of change.

386
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:35,290
And nothing can get in the way when change happens.

387
00:32:35,512 --> 00:32:39,098
Otherwise, we would still be living in caves worshipping fire.

388
00:33:25,427 --> 00:33:26,301
Hey.

389
00:33:35,834 --> 00:33:36,511
Hey,

390
00:33:37,017 --> 00:33:38,248
can I ask you something?

391
00:33:38,871 --> 00:33:40,296
What was Sean like before?

392
00:33:41,388 --> 00:33:42,466
Why are you asking?

393
00:33:43,065 --> 00:33:44,260
You lived with him before.

394
00:33:48,982 --> 00:33:49,764
This is weird.

395
00:33:51,301 --> 00:33:52,956
I feel good about him all of a sudden.

396
00:33:54,609 --> 00:33:55,781
It’s because you love him, isn’t it?

397
00:34:00,304 --> 00:34:01,476
You don’t need to ask.

398
00:34:02,484 --> 00:34:04,139
No matter how bad he and I used to fight,

399
00:34:05,233 --> 00:34:06,520
it has nothing to do with you.

400
00:34:10,351 --> 00:34:11,707
Your life is yours.

401
00:34:13,295 --> 00:34:15,295
I can’t protect you like we were kids anymore.

402
00:34:17,406 --> 00:34:22,325
You chose this way to fight and you must accept the consequences.

403
00:34:24,341 --> 00:34:25,626
I know that.

404
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,719
You saw the change of the people.

405
00:34:29,387 --> 00:34:30,345
We still have hope.

406
00:34:33,241 --> 00:34:34,007
We do.

407
00:34:34,503 --> 00:34:36,388
At least I accomplished one thing.

408
00:34:37,135 --> 00:34:38,606
You dealt with Todd, didn’t you?

409
00:34:38,786 --> 00:34:39,391
Umm.

410
00:34:39,867 --> 00:34:41,499
I don’t want you to do that anymore.

411
00:34:41,688 --> 00:34:42,626
It’s too much.

412
00:34:42,917 --> 00:34:46,250
I know it’s too much. That’s why I couldn’t really do it.

413
00:34:54,471 --> 00:34:55,896
If you could turn back time,

414
00:34:56,538 --> 00:34:58,423
would you kill me and get it over with?

415
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:05,460
Give me countless chances to turn back time,

416
00:35:06,884 --> 00:35:07,758
my decision would remain the same.

417
00:35:09,638 --> 00:35:11,063
We can’t kill each other, Black.

418
00:35:13,174 --> 00:35:14,783
Our paths may have taken a different turn

419
00:35:16,371 --> 00:35:18,003
but our intentions

420
00:35:20,382 --> 00:35:21,302
are just the same.

421
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:26,141
Should I finish you off right now, Todd?

422
00:35:34,166 --> 00:35:34,988
Go ahead.

423
00:35:37,654 --> 00:35:38,832
If you can.

424
00:35:45,115 --> 00:35:46,180
In the end,

425
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:48,081
I still couldn't do it.

426
00:35:49,478 --> 00:35:50,788
So how is he now?

427
00:35:52,445 --> 00:35:53,526
Like me.

428
00:35:54,427 --> 00:35:55,626
Like he did to me.

429
00:36:08,192 --> 00:36:09,089
In a coma?

430
00:36:14,577 --> 00:36:16,071
That should put him to sleep for a while.

431
00:36:17,977 --> 00:36:19,632
And when he wakes up,

432
00:36:20,617 --> 00:36:21,835
what are we going to do?

433
00:36:24,309 --> 00:36:25,626
Let the time decide.

434
00:36:27,223 --> 00:36:29,223
Some things can’t easily be changed.

435
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,543
But there’s one thing that changes.

436
00:36:32,735 --> 00:36:33,610
You know what it is?

437
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:36,344
Ideas?

438
00:36:37,132 --> 00:36:38,327
And people.

439
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:43,437
People’s ideas will let us know which way they hope this society to go.

440
00:36:46,509 --> 00:36:48,164
Then we need to keep fighting.

441
00:37:04,453 --> 00:37:06,108
The man in this picture,

442
00:37:07,253 --> 00:37:08,632
how do you think he’s feeling?

443
00:37:09,031 --> 00:37:09,826
Wanna race?

444
00:37:09,826 --> 00:37:13,375
Whoever gets to that post first can ask one thing from the other one.

445
00:39:07,951 --> 00:39:10,941
Mr. Yok, would you mind stepping over here and giving us an interview on your work?

446
00:39:10,941 --> 00:39:11,629
Sure.

447
00:39:14,857 --> 00:39:18,263
Proletariat Expressionism, what does this title mean?

448
00:39:18,335 --> 00:39:20,823
It means expressing proletariat through nudity.

449
00:39:21,366 --> 00:39:26,149
The term ‘proletariat’ to me doesn’t just refer to people in the working class and those living hand-to-mouth.

450
00:39:26,149 --> 00:39:30,835
I’d like to include everyone in our society who is oppressed under the working class scope.

451
00:39:31,012 --> 00:39:34,903
No matter how hard to what to make a change, they just aren’t able to.

452
00:40:48,278 --> 00:40:49,854
The man in this picture,

453
00:40:57,144 --> 00:40:58,531
how do you think he’s feeling?

454
00:41:17,369 --> 00:41:19,676
Don’t follow me if you want no regrets.

455
00:41:23,575 --> 00:41:24,679
Nothing, I guess.

456
00:41:31,675 --> 00:41:32,366
Yok.

457
00:41:37,035 --> 00:41:38,226
Promise me

458
00:41:38,677 --> 00:41:40,677
if I take you to the destination,

459
00:41:41,507 --> 00:41:42,490
you won’t leave me.

460
00:41:43,056 --> 00:41:43,884
I promise.

461
00:41:50,859 --> 00:41:51,869
I am sorry.

462
00:41:58,411 --> 00:42:00,081
You didn’t want to be part of the system.

463
00:42:00,461 --> 00:42:01,853
Then why are you doing this?

464
00:42:04,094 --> 00:42:04,983
And…

465
00:42:06,448 --> 00:42:07,434
I miss you.

466
00:42:19,318 --> 00:42:20,705
I quit my job.

467
00:42:23,087 --> 00:42:24,073
Yok, you go first.

468
00:42:25,146 --> 00:42:25,802
Argh!

469
00:42:27,149 --> 00:42:31,153
What you’re doing right now is like slowly fixing what you’ve done wrong.

470
00:42:34,094 --> 00:42:34,821
Go now.

471
00:42:34,821 --> 00:42:36,005
This is all I can do for you.

472
00:43:13,993 --> 00:43:15,356
I hope you don’t forget our promise again.

473
00:43:56,517 --> 00:44:00,262
Remember how I said this is the place I’m reborn?

474
00:44:03,468 --> 00:44:04,124
Umm.

475
00:44:07,501 --> 00:44:09,619
We’ve accomplished many things.

476
00:44:10,575 --> 00:44:12,575
It’s as though I’ve unlocked the thing with my dad too.

477
00:44:17,045 --> 00:44:18,691
Like you’re reborn, right?

478
00:44:22,205 --> 00:44:23,663
So many times have I been reborn.

479
00:44:30,706 --> 00:44:32,140
Just like a Pheonix,

480
00:44:33,326 --> 00:44:35,845
a bird that represents a free spirit.

481
00:44:37,623 --> 00:44:39,623
It dies and rises again from its ashes.

482
00:44:40,893 --> 00:44:42,469
It’s like the beginning of a new era.

483
00:44:53,938 --> 00:44:54,877
Wanna race?

484
00:44:55,443 --> 00:44:59,070
Whoever gets to that post first can ask one thing from the other one.

485
00:45:01,717 --> 00:45:04,259
Look who you’re challenging.

486
00:45:07,228 --> 00:45:09,228
Hey, wait for me.

487
00:45:39,152 --> 00:45:40,539
Aren’t you afraid to die anymore?

488
00:45:48,879 --> 00:45:49,644
You won.

489
00:45:51,153 --> 00:45:51,964
What will you ask from me?

490
00:46:07,145 --> 00:46:08,074
You serious?

491
00:46:13,191 --> 00:46:14,262
I want this button.

492
00:46:15,875 --> 00:46:17,050
Give me your hand.

493
00:46:49,025 --> 00:46:52,487
Now, our promise has been fulfilled.

494
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:56,316
Not yet.

495
00:47:18,569 --> 00:47:20,805
This is what we call fulfilled.

497
00:47:59,339 --> 00:48:00,820
How many years have we been friends?

498
00:48:01,578 --> 00:48:03,177
Since 7 or 8 years old,

499
00:48:03,390 --> 00:48:05,390
it has been 22 years now.

500
00:48:08,091 --> 00:48:09,101
Why, Korn?

501
00:48:09,383 --> 00:48:10,676
Why did my father give you the farm’s stocks?

502
00:48:10,962 --> 00:48:12,663
You know well that I hate his guts.

503
00:48:12,718 --> 00:48:14,383
Why do you still call him?

504
00:48:14,649 --> 00:48:16,790
This shit must end tonight.

505
00:48:17,441 --> 00:48:19,535
A WILL HAS TURNED THEIR RELATIONSHIP AND EVERYTHING UPSIDE DOWN.

506

How come I’m in Lin’s body?

The Venerable Uncle said
[A MISSION TO SWITCH BACK TO THEIR BODIES]

508
00:48:25,143 --> 00:48:27,017
I should go collect holy water from four temples

509
00:48:27,017 --> 00:48:27,881
and he will perform a ritual for us.

510
00:48:27,881 --> 00:48:28,396
Get in the car.

511
00:48:28,396 --> 00:48:29,670
Mind your own business.
