3
00:00:18,384 --> 00:00:19,961
What am I going to do?

4
00:00:20,925 --> 00:00:22,451
They are burning someone’s house down.

5
00:00:22,451 --> 00:00:23,614
Burn down what?

6
00:00:23,614 --> 00:00:25,105
Tawi’s forest trespassing house.

7
00:00:25,105 --> 00:00:25,899
Shit!

8
00:00:25,899 --> 00:00:27,787
You said no one was in the house.

9
00:00:27,787 --> 00:00:29,981
When I went in to save him, he was drawing some shit.

10
00:00:29,981 --> 00:00:31,656
Hey, are you all right?

11
00:00:31,886 --> 00:00:32,980
Wake up!

12
00:00:33,192 --> 00:00:34,318
Hey!

13
00:00:38,069 --> 00:00:40,763
The latest news about the fire at Tawi’s house, have you heard?

14
00:00:40,763 --> 00:00:42,438
I don’t think it’s just a fire.

15
00:00:42,438 --> 00:00:46,492
I think they meant to expose Tawi’s forest trespass.

16
00:01:47,235 --> 00:01:49,869
You just lost the race you challenged me.

17
00:01:50,071 --> 00:01:54,406
You wouldn’t have won if I hadn’t gone easy on you.

18
00:01:54,645 --> 00:01:56,673
You decided to go behind me yourself.

19
00:01:56,673 --> 00:01:57,993
Just admit that you lost.

20
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,789
I lost.

21
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:03,886
So?

22
00:02:03,886 --> 00:02:05,169
The loser gets this.

23
00:02:06,595 --> 00:02:08,595
You just started it.

24
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:09,900
Black!

25
00:02:10,146 --> 00:02:11,737
Watch your back.

26
00:04:39,956 --> 00:04:41,284
Hi, White.

27
00:04:41,934 --> 00:04:43,124
You’re home.

28
00:04:43,124 --> 00:04:44,519
Come here, son.

29
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,720
What are these?

30
00:04:48,503 --> 00:04:51,440
Let’s celebrate with a special meal.

31
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,245
Since you just passed the written exam.

32
00:04:55,245 --> 00:04:56,743
You already knew?

33
00:04:56,743 --> 00:04:58,612
But the result will come out tomorrow morning.

34
00:04:58,612 --> 00:05:01,694
My friend called and told me the news.

35
00:05:01,941 --> 00:05:03,775
Sit down

36
00:05:03,775 --> 00:05:05,395
and pass me a glass.

37
00:05:05,395 --> 00:05:06,995
Have a seat.

38
00:05:10,115 --> 00:05:11,389
Your glass.

39
00:05:12,621 --> 00:05:14,869
What happened to your hand?

40
00:05:15,511 --> 00:05:17,244
Just a small glass cut.

41
00:05:17,244 --> 00:05:18,535
Does it hurt badly?

42
00:05:18,535 --> 00:05:19,686
No.

43
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:21,276
Good then.

44
00:05:26,303 --> 00:05:27,519
Come on.

45
00:05:29,004 --> 00:05:31,004
Cheers.

46
00:05:42,822 --> 00:05:44,822
You did great.

47
00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:50,382
Don’t worry about the interview.

48
00:05:50,696 --> 00:05:53,093
You already have a desirable trait.

49
00:05:53,496 --> 00:05:57,219
As long as you don’t cause any trouble, you should be fine.

50
00:06:00,476 --> 00:06:03,686
And there's one important thing you should bear in mind.

51
00:06:04,268 --> 00:06:06,636
I know you graduated from abroad.

52
00:06:06,636 --> 00:06:10,479
You have a broad perspective, which is admirable.

53
00:06:11,689 --> 00:06:14,159
But remember that you’re now in Thailand.

54
00:06:16,552 --> 00:06:19,709
You should try to comprehend the concept of 'seniority.'

55
00:06:19,709 --> 00:06:24,604
Seniors value youngsters who aren't scared to voice their ideas.

56
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,531
But sometimes you can’t speak out about everything you think.

57
00:06:29,531 --> 00:06:32,887
You should be humble and respectful.

58
00:06:32,887 --> 00:06:35,352
That will win the hearts of the elderly.

59
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:37,994
Do you get it?

60
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,634
I do.

61
00:06:41,121 --> 00:06:43,121
You took the test to become a diplomat.

62
00:06:43,121 --> 00:06:46,073
Your main duty is to take care of your country.

63
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:48,770
You must first consider the interest of your country.

64
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:53,530
As for your personal opinion, you should keep it to yourself.

65
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:58,234
You must find an answer that pleases both parties.

66
00:07:00,257 --> 00:07:01,339
Yes.

67
00:07:03,542 --> 00:07:05,542
I am so proud of you.

68
00:07:06,874 --> 00:07:10,801
One day, you will become a great diplomat.

69
00:07:11,316 --> 00:07:12,933
I believe so.

70
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,220
What are you waiting for?

71
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,031
Let’s eat.

72
00:07:20,031 --> 00:07:22,857
These are your favorites.

73
00:07:27,374 --> 00:07:29,374
More to the left.

74
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,418
A bit left.

75
00:07:34,418 --> 00:07:36,211
And move it down.

76
00:07:39,138 --> 00:07:40,354
Is this okay?

77
00:07:40,354 --> 00:07:41,773
Yes.

78
00:08:11,307 --> 00:08:12,601
You’ve been distant all day.

79
00:08:12,601 --> 00:08:14,008
What are you thinking?

80
00:08:19,556 --> 00:08:20,503
Namo.

81
00:08:20,503 --> 00:08:23,847
Do you think it's possible if you came up to me one day and said

82
00:08:23,847 --> 00:08:29,112
you wanted to quit doing graffiti because it's bad?

83
00:08:29,359 --> 00:08:30,913
Do you believe you'll ever do something like that?

84
00:08:30,913 --> 00:08:32,315
Are you crazy?

85
00:08:32,315 --> 00:08:33,779
No way.

86
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:35,370
Right?

87
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:40,909
What made you wonder?

88
00:08:43,739 --> 00:08:45,112
Nothing.

89
00:08:45,694 --> 00:08:48,299
I just feel like Black has changed.

90
00:08:50,401 --> 00:08:51,774
I don’t know how to explain.

91
00:08:52,177 --> 00:08:54,017
It isn’t like him at all.

92
00:08:55,092 --> 00:08:58,887
I don’t know Black that well.

93
00:08:59,649 --> 00:09:03,940
But I think you two should talk it out.

94
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:06,067
Someone like him doesn’t just talk things out.

95
00:09:07,427 --> 00:09:08,800
If talking isn’t the solution,

96
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,137
try to find some other way to make him express what he feels.

97
00:09:17,486 --> 00:09:18,724
Sean.

98
00:09:20,205 --> 00:09:21,152
Hi, Namo.

99
00:09:21,152 --> 00:09:21,956
Hi.

100
00:09:21,956 --> 00:09:25,871
Namo, you know street art. Do you know an artist named UNAR?

101
00:09:25,871 --> 00:09:27,447
Of course.

102
00:09:27,447 --> 00:09:29,232
Who is he? Is he famous?

103
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:31,613
Very famous.

104
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:34,997
His work is about social criticism.

105
00:09:34,997 --> 00:09:40,433
His viral and famous pieces of work were all erased by those snobbish kiss asses

106
00:09:48,363 --> 00:09:50,072
Do you know him?

107
00:09:50,072 --> 00:09:53,492
I know him but I don’t know who he is.

108
00:09:55,049 --> 00:09:57,049
What do you mean?

109
00:09:57,385 --> 00:09:58,836
The thing is

110
00:09:59,262 --> 00:10:02,620
UNAR is well-known but he’s anonymous.

111
00:10:02,978 --> 00:10:06,076
Nobody knows who he truly is.

112
00:10:06,076 --> 00:10:10,720
His IG account is for sharing his work only.

113
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,309
Someone tried to track his digital footprint

114
00:10:13,309 --> 00:10:17,015
but it turned out to be an account of some foreigner who died.

115
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:19,588
I think it’s a fake account.

116
00:10:19,588 --> 00:10:22,109
Why did you ask? Do you want to see his work?

117
00:10:22,109 --> 00:10:23,555
It’s okay. I’ve seen them.

118
00:10:23,555 --> 00:10:24,929
Thank you.

119
00:10:25,479 --> 00:10:27,479
Sean. Let’s talk.

120
00:10:37,363 --> 00:10:39,631
Remember the day we burned down Tawi’s house?

121
00:10:39,631 --> 00:10:42,357
There was a guy trapped inside and I helped him out.

122
00:10:42,962 --> 00:10:46,316
I tracked him down. He is this artist.

123
00:10:46,316 --> 00:10:48,379
His work is all about social satire.

124
00:10:48,872 --> 00:10:51,361
I don’t think he works for Tawi.

125
00:10:51,602 --> 00:10:54,207
Then why was he inside Tawi’s house?

126
00:10:54,749 --> 00:10:56,531
Maybe he can’t stand it anymore, just like us.

127
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:58,531
That’s why he painted this art to dispraise Tawi.

128
00:10:59,685 --> 00:11:01,685
I want him to work with us.

129
00:11:02,402 --> 00:11:04,249
Just don’t ask for trouble.

130
00:11:04,585 --> 00:11:07,640
If he wants to reveal himself, he won’t hide his identity like this.

131
00:11:08,155 --> 00:11:11,491
It’s not like every one is willing to go combative.

132
00:11:16,245 --> 00:11:17,909
Black, you box with Yok.

133
00:11:17,909 --> 00:11:18,638
Good.

134
00:11:18,638 --> 00:11:19,814
I haven’t fought you in a long time.

135
00:11:20,675 --> 00:11:22,093
Hold on.

136
00:11:22,317 --> 00:11:23,971
I will fight him.

137
00:11:24,776 --> 00:11:26,194
Come on.

138
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,400
Mom, aren’t you going to work today?

139
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,911
(I’m not taking a day off. I just don’t work there anymore.)

140
00:12:24,463 --> 00:12:26,463
Why not?

141
00:12:26,463 --> 00:12:28,918
(The house owner hired someone else to work.)

142
00:12:29,534 --> 00:12:32,670
Why? You just started working there.

143
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:37,507
(She didn’t know that I’m mute. And she isn’t okay with that.)

144
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,442
That’s the reason?

145
00:12:39,442 --> 00:12:43,212
She insulted you. I will report this to the Department of Labour Protection and Welfare.

146
00:12:44,244 --> 00:12:47,670
(It’s my fault. I made her feel uncomfortable.)

147
00:12:48,023 --> 00:12:49,387
I don’t get it.

148
00:12:49,387 --> 00:12:51,347
How could you even make her feel uncomfortable?

149
00:12:51,709 --> 00:12:54,345
(She wasn't used to a maid who couldn't talk.)

150
00:12:54,345 --> 00:12:57,700
(She wanted someone who could talk and keep her company.)

151
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:01,088
If she wanted a friend to talk to, why didn’t she call someone?

152
00:13:14,448 --> 00:13:16,095
You don’t need to work.

153
00:13:16,347 --> 00:13:18,729
I will.

154
00:13:18,729 --> 00:13:22,576
You stay home. I will take care of you.

155
00:13:22,576 --> 00:13:26,053
(I don’t want to stay home and do nothing.)

156
00:13:26,053 --> 00:13:29,864
(I can work like normal people.)

157
00:13:30,064 --> 00:13:34,454
I know you can but there are some people who don’t know that.

158
00:13:34,454 --> 00:13:36,391
They are ready to look down on you once they see you.

159
00:13:36,391 --> 00:13:42,424
(I’m used to it, Yok. That’s why I need to prove I can do it.)

160
00:13:42,424 --> 00:13:47,110
(If you stop me, it means you don’t believe in me either.)

161
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:49,865
(I will look for a new job tomorrow.)

162
00:13:49,865 --> 00:13:54,914
(My friend told me there was a beverage manufacturer that employs people with disabilities.)

163
00:13:54,914 --> 00:14:00,267
(I might get a permanent job there and stop being anyone’s dependant.)

164
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,780
Whatever makes you feel happy, go ahead.

165
00:14:08,856 --> 00:14:10,856
I’m off to university.

166
00:14:37,522 --> 00:14:38,640
Hey.

167
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,150
Hi. You passed the written test too?

168
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,249
I did.

169
00:14:42,249 --> 00:14:43,792
You’re here for the interview?

170
00:14:43,792 --> 00:14:45,039
Right.

171
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:46,213
Are you excited?

172
00:14:47,893 --> 00:14:49,364
Not really.

173
00:14:49,364 --> 00:14:51,168
Let’s just say I’m nervous.

174
00:14:51,596 --> 00:14:53,906
And you? Are you worried?

175
00:14:54,249 --> 00:14:56,249
I’m not worried about the interview.

176
00:14:56,249 --> 00:14:59,330
I’m more worried about working in The Ministry.

177
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:02,450
I’m not sure if the work culture there fits me.

178
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:06,741
Wow! You seem really confident that you’ll pass.

179
00:15:10,322 --> 00:15:11,843
You know what?

180
00:15:11,843 --> 00:15:14,734
I never pictured myself as a bureau official.

181
00:15:14,986 --> 00:15:20,433
A diplomat job doesn’t come easy, so I want to prove I can do it.

182
00:15:21,438 --> 00:15:23,438
How do you prove it?

183
00:15:23,438 --> 00:15:25,761
I’m from a middle-class family.

184
00:15:25,761 --> 00:15:33,008
But there are some rich and privileged kids who always get pleased by people.

185
00:15:33,487 --> 00:15:35,682
I must fight them with my skills.

186
00:15:35,682 --> 00:15:38,451
It’s the only thing I’ve got.

187
00:15:39,724 --> 00:15:41,724
I think the test here is good because it’s fair.

188
00:15:42,328 --> 00:15:45,274
We will see who really has skills.

189
00:15:45,274 --> 00:15:47,341
It’s a diplomat position after all.

190
00:15:47,341 --> 00:15:50,196
They need to find someone who’s qualified to represent the nation.

191
00:15:50,196 --> 00:15:52,124
Look at the other side.

192
00:15:52,124 --> 00:15:55,679
It’s not like everyone has a chance to be here.

193
00:15:56,233 --> 00:16:01,285
You know that not everyone in our country has the same educational opportunities.

194
00:16:04,648 --> 00:16:08,386
Number 12, Mr. Savate Pothiyakorn.

195
00:16:08,612 --> 00:16:09,579
Yes.

196
00:16:09,856 --> 00:16:11,584
You can proceed to the interview room.

197
00:16:11,811 --> 00:16:13,283
It’s my turn now.

198
00:16:13,283 --> 00:16:14,998
Pothiyakorn?

199
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:17,738
Are you related to the ambassador, Mr. Adule Pothiyakorn?

200
00:16:17,738 --> 00:16:19,156
He’s my father.

201
00:16:25,732 --> 00:16:30,122
No wonder why you’re so sure you’d pass.

202
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,400
I bet you really do.

203
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,960
Good luck with the interview.

204
00:16:51,848 --> 00:16:57,522
(Many people become friendly after they learn my family name.)

205
00:16:57,522 --> 00:17:00,603
(He is the first to make me wonder)

206
00:17:01,182 --> 00:17:06,120
(if the privileges I've had my entire life come from exploiting others.)

207
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,003
Hello.

208
00:17:13,003 --> 00:17:14,535
Please have a seat.

209
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:22,305
Are you ready?

210
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:27,201
White, this is Mr. Vichian.

211
00:17:27,201 --> 00:17:30,204
White is taking a test for a position in The Ministry next week.

212
00:17:34,363 --> 00:17:35,607
I am.

213
00:17:37,109 --> 00:17:39,512
My name is Savate Pothiyakorn.

214
00:17:39,512 --> 00:17:41,512
You don’t need to introduce yourself.

215
00:17:42,671 --> 00:17:45,488
Should we start with the question?

216
00:17:46,153 --> 00:17:53,089
If UNESCO excluded Thailand from being nominated for a world heritage site due to human rights issues within the country,

217
00:17:53,089 --> 00:17:56,397
as a diplomat, how would you explain it to people?

218
00:18:08,953 --> 00:18:10,953
1, 2.

219
00:18:10,953 --> 00:18:11,782
Jab.

220
00:18:11,782 --> 00:18:13,751
1, 2.

221
00:18:13,751 --> 00:18:14,536
Jab.

222
00:18:14,536 --> 00:18:16,296
1, 2. 1, 2.

223
00:18:16,296 --> 00:18:17,986
4 punches.

224
00:18:18,122 --> 00:18:19,193
A straight punch.

225
00:18:20,029 --> 00:18:21,550
Weave.

226
00:18:22,876 --> 00:18:24,876
Jab.

227
00:18:24,876 --> 00:18:25,935
1, 2.

228
00:18:28,242 --> 00:18:29,688
Black.

229
00:18:30,956 --> 00:18:32,956
What was that for, Yok?

230
00:18:32,956 --> 00:18:34,281
You let your guard down. I couldn’t help it.

231
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:35,339
Come on.

232
00:18:35,465 --> 00:18:37,522
I’m tired. I won’t train you anymore.

233
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:40,861
Black, you box with him.

234
00:18:43,009 --> 00:18:44,329
Good.

235
00:18:44,329 --> 00:18:46,088
I haven’t fought you in a long time.

236
00:18:51,925 --> 00:18:53,270
Hurry up.

237
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,526
Hold on.

238
00:19:02,664 --> 00:19:04,664
I will fight him.

239
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:07,479
What the heck?

240
00:19:07,983 --> 00:19:09,858
Stay out of this.

241
00:19:10,244 --> 00:19:11,438
Yok.

242
00:19:17,177 --> 00:19:19,177
Come on.

243
00:19:21,437 --> 00:19:22,522
Start!

244
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:26,370
I said come in.

245
00:19:33,257 --> 00:19:35,257
I haven’t started yet.

246
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:39,311
These are for what you did to me yesterday.

247
00:19:46,238 --> 00:19:47,522
Well, let’s box.

248
00:19:49,131 --> 00:19:50,426
Step in.

249
00:19:50,426 --> 00:19:51,935
What are they playing?

250
00:19:52,162 --> 00:19:54,258
No idea. I’m waiting to see it here.

251
00:19:54,258 --> 00:19:55,536
Come on.

252
00:19:55,863 --> 00:19:57,389
Fight me.

253
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,050
Move forward.

254
00:21:00,883 --> 00:21:02,883
Take him to the couch.

255
00:21:06,881 --> 00:21:08,881
You were so harsh on him, Sean.

256
00:21:08,881 --> 00:21:10,697
Go get him some cold compression.

257
00:21:14,845 --> 00:21:16,845
Black.

258
00:21:19,353 --> 00:21:20,623
You’re finished.

259
00:21:20,623 --> 00:21:22,630
It’s my turn to mock you now.

260
00:21:33,075 --> 00:21:35,075
You’re awake?

261
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:54,780
Sean, find him an ammonia inhalant.

262
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,677
And bandage him.

263
00:21:56,677 --> 00:21:58,163
You do it.

264
00:21:58,163 --> 00:21:59,388
Why would I?

265
00:21:59,388 --> 00:22:00,693
You’re the one that punched him.

266
00:22:00,693 --> 00:22:03,470
Yok, come help me with the mats.

267
00:22:09,998 --> 00:22:11,998
Inhale this. You will get better.

268
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:15,376
I want this.

269
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:16,507
It’s mine.

270
00:22:16,507 --> 00:22:18,230
Can’t you just share it?

271
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,140
You should get some bandage.

272
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,703
I’ll do it myself.

273
00:22:26,703 --> 00:22:28,819
Gumpa told me to help you.

274
00:22:28,819 --> 00:22:30,365
You stay still.

275
00:22:30,781 --> 00:22:32,781
Face towards me.

276
00:22:46,696 --> 00:22:48,696
Does it hurt?

277
00:22:56,994 --> 00:22:58,994
Is it better?

278
00:23:09,062 --> 00:23:11,918
Sean, go help Yok store the mats.

279
00:23:11,918 --> 00:23:13,534
I need to talk to Black.

280
00:23:20,308 --> 00:23:22,308
Black, follow me.

281
00:23:35,201 --> 00:23:37,201
Let me see it.

282
00:23:40,049 --> 00:23:42,049
It doesn’t look so bad.

283
00:23:45,482 --> 00:23:48,842
Black that I trained was better than this.

284
00:23:53,253 --> 00:23:54,800
Now you shoot.

285
00:23:58,676 --> 00:24:00,676
Don’t be afraid.

286
00:24:00,676 --> 00:24:04,256
I’m teaching you to protect yourself, not to harm people.

287
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:09,810
Legs apart.

288
00:24:12,522 --> 00:24:14,522
If you don’t want to shoot, don’t pull the trigger.

289
00:24:14,522 --> 00:24:16,018
Get your finger off it.

290
00:24:16,018 --> 00:24:17,361
Hold it firmly.

291
00:24:31,878 --> 00:24:33,299
Your hands are very soft.

292
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:34,417
What did you do to them?

293
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:42,117
You’ve been worse after the fire.

294
00:24:43,452 --> 00:24:46,308
I’m just tired, nothing else.

295
00:24:47,396 --> 00:24:49,783
Stay here with me at the garage.

296
00:24:51,019 --> 00:24:53,019
Why do I have to stay here?

297
00:24:53,598 --> 00:24:55,787
I will train you to be as good as you once were.

298
00:24:57,139 --> 00:24:58,786
I think I’m okay.

299
00:24:58,786 --> 00:25:00,137
You’re not.

300
00:25:00,741 --> 00:25:03,248
I don’t see the fire in your eyes.

301
00:25:03,248 --> 00:25:04,949
You lack the strength.

302
00:25:04,949 --> 00:25:06,612
Your heart is weakened.

303
00:25:07,171 --> 00:25:09,171
You can fool everyone

304
00:25:09,952 --> 00:25:11,893
but me.

305
00:25:13,541 --> 00:25:14,685
So?

306
00:25:14,685 --> 00:25:16,761
Are you going to stay here or not?

307
00:25:19,704 --> 00:25:21,704
Can I at least think about it?

308
00:25:24,364 --> 00:25:27,598
My name is Gumpa. I’m the owner of this garage.

309
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,424
I insist on you staying here with me.

310
00:25:33,701 --> 00:25:35,746
And everything will get easier.

311
00:25:46,691 --> 00:25:48,036
Damn it!

312
00:25:48,682 --> 00:25:52,764
Diplomats must put the country’s best interest first.

313
00:25:52,764 --> 00:25:54,764


314
00:27:06,415 --> 00:27:07,472
Hi, dad.

315
00:27:07,882 --> 00:27:09,143
Where have you been?

316
00:27:09,143 --> 00:27:11,070
Why didn’t you answer my calls?

317
00:27:12,341 --> 00:27:13,746
My phone died.

318
00:27:13,746 --> 00:27:15,540
What do you want to talk to me about?

319
00:27:15,868 --> 00:27:18,055
Don’t you know anything at all?

320
00:27:20,515 --> 00:27:22,146
Know what?

321
00:27:22,146 --> 00:27:24,859
The answer you gave in the interview room.

322
00:27:24,859 --> 00:27:27,688
You made people upset.

323
00:27:28,509 --> 00:27:30,509
Ah! That.

324
00:27:36,241 --> 00:27:38,241
Don’t you feel bad about it at all?

325
00:27:38,828 --> 00:27:40,828
Are you even listening to me?

326
00:27:41,402 --> 00:27:45,900
I am and I don’t think my answer caused any trouble.

327
00:27:47,295 --> 00:27:49,295
Tell me what your answer was.

328
00:27:51,719 --> 00:27:58,496
If UNESCO excluded Thailand from being nominated for a world heritage site due to human rights issues within the country,

329
00:27:58,496 --> 00:28:01,729
as a diplomat, how would you explain it to people?

330
00:28:03,208 --> 00:28:08,981
I said, we must first admit that there are human rights violations happening.

331
00:28:08,981 --> 00:28:11,686
Take the blame and quickly solve the problem.

332
00:28:11,829 --> 00:28:13,987
Then we may re-nominate later.

333
00:28:13,987 --> 00:28:16,387
Otherwise, being a world heritage site means nothing.

334
00:28:17,714 --> 00:28:20,801
You said, we must speak the truth.

335
00:28:21,663 --> 00:28:23,663
That’s not going to work.

336
00:28:24,404 --> 00:28:29,101
You must say Thai principles are in accordance with international norms.

337
00:28:29,101 --> 00:28:32,063
Our justice system is fair for all parties.

338
00:28:32,821 --> 00:28:37,179
But Dad, your answer is devoid of truth.

339
00:28:37,179 --> 00:28:38,658
I can’t say that.

340
00:28:43,939 --> 00:28:45,201
White, listen to me.

341
00:28:45,475 --> 00:28:49,345
We are not judges who can decide who is right or wrong.

342
00:28:50,264 --> 00:28:54,108
Diplomats must put the country’s best interest first.

343
00:28:54,108 --> 00:28:55,760
That’s your duty.

344
00:28:55,986 --> 00:28:59,473
But Dad, in order to contain the best interests of the country,

345
00:28:59,473 --> 00:29:02,630
we must also consider the principle of humanity.

346
00:29:03,143 --> 00:29:05,652
A nation is built by its people.

347
00:29:07,267 --> 00:29:09,267
You don’t understand.

348
00:29:10,221 --> 00:29:11,585
I get it now.

349
00:29:11,585 --> 00:29:13,206
I failed, didn’t I?

350
00:29:14,339 --> 00:29:15,744
You passed.

351
00:29:15,744 --> 00:29:17,561
What you said was right.

352
00:29:17,787 --> 00:29:19,874
But it was too blunt.

353
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:24,393
The juries like you though. They think you’re brave.

354
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,858
If you’re some other guy,

355
00:29:26,858 --> 00:29:28,196
they would flunk you.

356
00:29:28,196 --> 00:29:30,078
Some other guy?

357
00:29:30,331 --> 00:29:32,665
But I’m your son. That’s how I passed.

358
00:29:33,127 --> 00:29:36,322
Other people work so hard to get here.

359
00:29:36,322 --> 00:29:37,670
But you use your connections.

360
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:39,085
There are no connections.

361
00:29:39,516 --> 00:29:41,974
Don’t talk about the ministry like that.

362
00:29:41,974 --> 00:29:45,007
This, the thing you’re doing, is connection.

363
00:29:45,007 --> 00:29:46,421
It’s cheating.

364
00:29:46,421 --> 00:29:49,328
One of the juries is the person you introduced me to over dinner.

365
00:29:49,328 --> 00:29:51,127
Don’t talk about my friend like that.

366
00:29:51,127 --> 00:29:53,085
You’ve gone too far, White.

367
00:29:57,986 --> 00:29:59,760
White, where are you going?

368
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,714
White!

369
00:30:00,922 --> 00:30:02,922
White, come back and talk to me.

370
00:30:03,186 --> 00:30:04,530
White!

371
00:30:33,607 --> 00:30:35,607
You finally came.

372
00:30:36,583 --> 00:30:37,763
Yeah.

373
00:30:41,644 --> 00:30:43,090
Are you in trouble?

374
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:44,423
I can see it on your face.

375
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:50,471
It’s fine if you don’t want to talk.

376
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,220
You can vent it out over there.

377
00:31:20,264 --> 00:31:24,130
(Everyone competes, one way or another.)

378
00:31:26,163 --> 00:31:28,163
(No one wants to lose.)

379
00:31:34,334 --> 00:31:39,287
(Because I was born with privileges, I’m closer to the finish line than others.)

380
00:31:40,785 --> 00:31:43,523
(The rules are clearly unfair.)

381
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:53,089
(I’m angry for not seeing I’ve always been part of the problem.)

382
00:32:26,644 --> 00:32:27,680
Auntie.

383
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:29,191
Is my order ready?

384
00:32:29,191 --> 00:32:31,584
Coming up next. Just a moment.

385
00:32:32,095 --> 00:32:33,685
Thank you.

386
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:42,166
Dance of the privileges.

387
00:32:42,166 --> 00:32:44,669
At Tawi’s sports stadium?

388
00:35:12,454 --> 00:35:13,880
Don’t follow me

389
00:35:14,405 --> 00:35:16,128
if you want no regrets.

390
00:35:32,572 --> 00:35:33,936
Black will share the room with you.

391
00:35:33,936 --> 00:35:35,924
It’s okay. I can crash somewhere else.

392
00:35:35,924 --> 00:35:39,339
Don’t you even think you will get to stay comfortably.

393
00:35:39,339 --> 00:35:40,623
What are you gonna do to me?

394
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:10,990
You will sleep in the same room with Sean.

395
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:12,841
Why do I have to stay here?

396
00:36:14,007 --> 00:36:15,265
Why not?

397
00:36:15,265 --> 00:36:16,625
His room has extra space for you.

398
00:36:16,625 --> 00:36:18,386
It shouldn’t be a problem.

399
00:36:30,867 --> 00:36:32,540
What is it?

400
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:34,231
Black will share the room with you.

401
00:36:35,923 --> 00:36:37,378
Why is that?

402
00:36:37,727 --> 00:36:39,225
He’s in a bit of trouble.

403
00:36:39,225 --> 00:36:41,246
He will stay here for a month.

404
00:36:43,556 --> 00:36:45,556
What trouble do you have?

405
00:36:45,883 --> 00:36:48,013
It’s okay. I can crash somewhere else.

406
00:36:48,013 --> 00:36:49,524
I own this garage.

407
00:36:49,786 --> 00:36:51,545
I have the right to tell you where to sleep.

408
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:53,611
But I work here.

409
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:54,528
And what does he do?

410
00:36:54,528 --> 00:36:56,307
Stop talking, Sean.

411
00:36:57,195 --> 00:36:58,693
Here is your stuff.

412
00:36:58,693 --> 00:36:59,699
No, it’s okay.

413
00:36:59,699 --> 00:37:00,326
Just get in.

414
00:37:00,326 --> 00:37:01,438
I better sleep somewhere else.

415
00:37:01,438 --> 00:37:02,601
It’s my place, my order.

416
00:37:02,601 --> 00:37:03,931
Get in there.

417
00:37:20,223 --> 00:37:21,481
What?

418
00:37:21,729 --> 00:37:23,481
Are you scared of me?

419
00:37:25,416 --> 00:37:27,416
Why would I be?

420
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:35,292
Where should I sleep?

421
00:37:35,292 --> 00:37:36,783
Here, on the floor.

422
00:37:36,783 --> 00:37:38,715
It’s your place.

423
00:37:46,145 --> 00:37:49,847
Don’t you even think you will get to stay comfortably.

424
00:37:50,402 --> 00:37:52,402
Why? What are you gonna do to me?

425
00:38:01,552 --> 00:38:03,552
What can I possibly do to you, Black?

426
00:38:04,294 --> 00:38:06,811
Why did you throw my bag down there?

427
00:38:06,811 --> 00:38:08,864
Well, this is my bed, and that is your bed.

428
00:38:08,864 --> 00:38:10,047
Isn’t that right?

429
00:38:15,544 --> 00:38:18,310
Clear off your stuff. I will sleep right here.

430
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:20,353
If you want to sleep here, do it yourself.

431
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,313
Where is the bathroom?

432
00:38:44,401 --> 00:38:45,768
Downstairs.

433
00:39:26,321 --> 00:39:27,623
I’m not done yet.

434
00:39:27,623 --> 00:39:28,764
I didn’t ask.

435
00:39:31,796 --> 00:39:33,796
Why are you knocking then?

436
00:39:33,796 --> 00:39:35,542
Do you want a towel or not?

437
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:39,877
Yeah.

438
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:43,870
How about a thank you?

439
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:45,812
I also helped you take off your shirt.

440
00:39:46,379 --> 00:39:47,844
Counting favors like a kid.

441
00:39:47,844 --> 00:39:49,327
No towel for you then.

442
00:39:49,327 --> 00:39:51,367
Sean, give it to me.

443
00:39:51,367 --> 00:39:52,343
Sean.

444
00:39:52,518 --> 00:39:53,583
Sean.

445
00:40:09,312 --> 00:40:11,312
Let go.

446
00:40:40,335 --> 00:40:42,335
What the hell are you playing?

447
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:45,085
I didn’t realize you’d fall so easily.

448
00:40:45,085 --> 00:40:47,152
I normally fly-kicked you and you could still stand.

449
00:40:47,152 --> 00:40:48,783
Hurry up. I need to go to bed.

450
00:40:48,783 --> 00:40:50,011
Just go to bed.

451
00:40:50,011 --> 00:40:51,861
You will make noise and that will wake me up.

452
00:40:52,341 --> 00:40:54,602
Once I’m awake, it’s hard to go back to sleep.

453
00:40:54,948 --> 00:40:56,948
Make it quick.

454
00:41:32,158 --> 00:41:34,158
You read quite a lot.

455
00:41:34,569 --> 00:41:35,915
Why?

456
00:41:35,915 --> 00:41:37,759
Someone like me doesn’t seem like a reader?

457
00:41:38,086 --> 00:41:41,149
It’s not that. I’m just surprised.

458
00:41:41,883 --> 00:41:43,883
I must work hard.

459
00:41:44,814 --> 00:41:48,524
The more I read, the more I learn.

460
00:41:51,924 --> 00:41:54,818
I don't have a judge for a mother like you.

461
00:42:00,763 --> 00:42:02,763
Don’t bring up her.

462
00:42:02,763 --> 00:42:04,645
She is no longer in my life.

463
00:42:06,652 --> 00:42:09,615
You started off a lot better than me anyways.

464
00:42:12,171 --> 00:42:15,924
Since the day you were born, you have been ahead of many others.

465
00:42:16,709 --> 00:42:19,317
Especially in a shitty place like this,

466
00:42:19,644 --> 00:42:23,492
I, who have nothing, must work even harder.

467
00:42:34,898 --> 00:42:39,058
(Sean just confirmed what I’m thinking is right.)

468
00:42:39,846 --> 00:42:44,472
(Fair competitions only result from fair rules.)

469
00:42:46,509 --> 00:42:48,247
(What if the rules aren’t fair?)

470
00:42:48,247 --> 00:42:51,047
(Is it right to break them?)

Hey! What are you doing?

473
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,280
Are you stealing my food?

474
00:44:16,545 --> 00:44:19,896
I’m starving. I haven’t eaten anything all day.

475
00:44:19,896 --> 00:44:22,503
Are you sure this is all you’re doing?

476
00:44:29,302 --> 00:44:30,669
Come here.

477
00:44:31,924 --> 00:44:35,520
I will hold you like this so I know when you sneak away.

478
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,214
I can’t sleep like this.

479
00:44:37,214 --> 00:44:39,455
That’s your problem, not mine.

It’s tear gas! Watch out!

482
00:45:12,527 --> 00:45:15,016
They don’t care what’s right or wrong.

483

In the next mission,

485
00:45:23,553 --> 00:45:26,647
is there any issue in our society you’d like to address?

486
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:32,577
I'm curious to see if you can attack Tawi harder than last time.

487
00:45:32,577 --> 00:45:33,974
Fine.

488
00:45:33,974 --> 00:45:35,485
Just wait and see.
