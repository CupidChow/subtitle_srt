3
00:00:18,883 --> 00:00:20,670
White, Black is dying.

4
00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:26,815
I will take your place in the gang.

5
00:00:28,287 --> 00:00:30,287
They are very dangerous.

6
00:00:30,287 --> 00:00:31,907
You must look after yourself.

7
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:34,905
Do you think Black was really involved with an illegal business?

8
00:00:34,905 --> 00:00:40,301
(Tawi Kuerkulsvasti, a businessman who’s continually been in the headlines since I lived in Russia.)

9
00:00:40,301 --> 00:00:42,112
This asshole enjoys taking advantage of others.

10
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,745
Let’s go.

11
00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:46,675
Let’s burn down Tawi’s house.

12
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:10,954
There’s a hill up ahead. Be careful.

13
00:01:11,105 --> 00:01:12,811
We’re reaching a hill. Move closer.

14
00:01:12,811 --> 00:01:14,268
We don’t want a wheelie.

15
00:01:15,582 --> 00:01:18,566
Hurry! I can’t keep up with them because of you.

16
00:01:18,566 --> 00:01:19,381
I'll take the lead.

17
00:01:19,381 --> 00:01:21,435
You asked to me ride with you.

18
00:01:21,435 --> 00:01:23,915
Hold on tight. I will speed up.

19
00:01:23,915 --> 00:01:26,076
Just do it. I won’t fall off.

20
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,897
Arms around my waist now!

21
00:01:29,727 --> 00:01:30,830
Do it!

22
00:01:33,765 --> 00:01:35,569
Lean forward.

23
00:01:37,205 --> 00:01:39,205
Close enough for you?

24
00:01:41,243 --> 00:01:43,243
Just stay like this all the way there.

25
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:50,974
(I took Black's place and joined these lads on their quest.)

26
00:01:50,974 --> 00:01:54,934
(But it turns out I know nothing about my twin brother.)

27
00:01:54,934 --> 00:01:58,000
(He is doing something I don’t know.)

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,841
(And it’s making me feel even more distant from him.)

29
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,673
Want some?

30
00:03:28,554 --> 00:03:30,000
Do you want it?

31
00:03:30,746 --> 00:03:31,971
No.

32
00:03:37,023 --> 00:03:39,023
If you want to smoke, just do it now.

33
00:03:39,023 --> 00:03:41,942
You won’t get a smoke break when we hit the road.

34
00:03:43,454 --> 00:03:45,454
Are you quitting?

35
00:03:49,323 --> 00:03:51,323
He doesn’t want to quit.

36
00:03:51,323 --> 00:03:53,405
He just doesn’t want to owe you anything.

37
00:03:55,377 --> 00:03:57,377
Guys, let’s discuss the plan.

38
00:03:58,425 --> 00:04:00,425
This is Tawi’s house in the national forest.

39
00:04:00,425 --> 00:04:02,055
We are right here.

40
00:04:02,055 --> 00:04:04,218
From now on, we will take the wooded trail.

41
00:04:04,218 --> 00:04:06,767
Do not use GPS since we can be tracked.

42
00:04:06,767 --> 00:04:09,137
Memorize the route. Make no errors.

43
00:04:09,137 --> 00:04:11,994
Okay. The roads are rough.

44
00:04:11,994 --> 00:04:13,430
Be careful.

45
00:04:14,364 --> 00:04:15,848
Now before we go in,

46
00:04:15,848 --> 00:04:18,726
Black, go over the plan with us all again.

47
00:04:23,487 --> 00:04:25,487
Enough with the reiteration.

48
00:04:28,656 --> 00:04:30,656
Yok, you do it then.

49
00:04:31,848 --> 00:04:33,848
So no one will deviate from the plan again.

50
00:04:35,667 --> 00:04:37,667
Lights off 200 meters before we reach the house.

51
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:39,271
When we get to the house,

52
00:04:39,271 --> 00:04:42,030
Gram and I will climb up the walls to detect the guards.

53
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:45,960
And you two, follow us and take down all the guards.

54
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,650
When we get inside, pour the gasoline in many areas.

55
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:54,384
And the last step, set it on fire and marvel at the beauty of Tawi's flaming residence.

56
00:04:56,317 --> 00:04:59,200
Okay. We will leave in 10 minutes.

57
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,098
Let’s go get the gasoline.

58
00:05:01,098 --> 00:05:03,872
We have lots of things to do. Come on.

59
00:05:20,552 --> 00:05:22,552
Black, will you hurry?

60
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:29,148
Don’t just stand there. Help.

61
00:05:56,999 --> 00:05:58,675
What’s up, Black?

62
00:05:58,675 --> 00:05:59,852
(I am White.)

63
00:05:59,852 --> 00:06:02,636
Sorry. It says Black on my contact list.

64
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,308
What am I going to do? They are burning someone’s house down.

65
00:06:06,308 --> 00:06:07,848
Burn down what?

66
00:06:07,848 --> 00:06:10,089
Tawi’s forest trespassing house.

67
00:06:10,089 --> 00:06:11,335
Shit!

68
00:06:11,929 --> 00:06:14,017
They’re doing something illegal.

69
00:06:14,017 --> 00:06:15,262
I can’t do it.

70
00:06:15,262 --> 00:06:16,368
Stay calm.

71
00:06:16,368 --> 00:06:17,717
You've become Black.

72
00:06:17,717 --> 00:06:18,751
You can’t back off.

73
00:06:18,751 --> 00:06:21,381
What if someone is harmed or killed?

74
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,196
I don’t want to be part of it.

75
00:06:23,196 --> 00:06:25,397
If you retreat now, you will be busted.

76
00:06:25,397 --> 00:06:27,111
Just go with the flow.

77
00:06:27,111 --> 00:06:30,031
Remind yourself that you’re finding those who hurt Black.

78
00:06:30,031 --> 00:06:32,052
You don’t have to take any action.

79
00:06:32,052 --> 00:06:33,987
Try to stay away and watch your back.

80
00:06:33,987 --> 00:06:36,526
Just get tonight over with.

81
00:06:42,242 --> 00:06:43,768
What are you doing here?

82
00:06:43,913 --> 00:06:45,993
Who did you just call?

83
00:06:47,097 --> 00:06:48,171
Nothing.

84
00:06:48,171 --> 00:06:51,104
I was just looking at the map again.

85
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:57,649
Are you sure you’re okay?

86
00:07:01,027 --> 00:07:02,079
Yes.

87
00:07:12,903 --> 00:07:14,080
Guys,

88
00:07:14,274 --> 00:07:16,956
are you certain about the burn?

89
00:07:18,946 --> 00:07:20,946
Are we really doing it?

90
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,625
What the hell now?

91
00:07:25,438 --> 00:07:27,438
You’re getting chickened out now?

92
00:07:27,869 --> 00:07:29,510
I’m not.

93
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:32,796
I’m just making sure we are really doing this.

94
00:07:33,513 --> 00:07:35,468
People will be in trouble because of what we’re doing.

95
00:07:35,468 --> 00:07:38,379
Someone like you knows how to be concerned about others?

96
00:07:38,543 --> 00:07:40,186
What's the matter with you?

97
00:07:41,896 --> 00:07:43,896
We’re just burning a house no one lives in.

98
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:46,738
Who will be in trouble, except for Tawi?

99
00:07:47,192 --> 00:07:50,843
He must know that some people are angry because he is above the law.

100
00:07:52,864 --> 00:07:55,553
I double-checked. No one is in the house.

101
00:07:55,795 --> 00:07:57,795
What else is bothering you?

102
00:07:57,795 --> 00:07:59,709
Do you want to sit this one out?

103
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,400
I don’t.

104
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,044
I just wanted to test you all.

105
00:08:09,044 --> 00:08:11,571
I was making sure no one changed their minds.

106
00:08:11,571 --> 00:08:12,598
Damn!

107
00:08:12,598 --> 00:08:14,234
What a waste of time.

108
00:08:14,471 --> 00:08:17,199
If you back off now, you’ll have to deal with me.

109
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,866
Does anyone want to ask or test anyone again?

110
00:08:31,239 --> 00:08:33,239
Are you coming or not?

111
00:08:59,765 --> 00:09:01,765
I checked the inside, it’s empty.

112
00:09:01,765 --> 00:09:03,496
But we have one security guard over there.

113
00:09:03,496 --> 00:09:06,062
Black, you take down the guard.

114
00:09:06,062 --> 00:09:07,691
Give me the bag.

115
00:09:07,691 --> 00:09:09,301
Gram, you go out front with me.

116
00:09:46,601 --> 00:09:48,601
Who’s there?

117
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Who are you?

118
00:09:53,545 --> 00:09:55,093
Talk!

119
00:09:56,461 --> 00:09:58,461
How did you get here?

120
00:10:17,445 --> 00:10:19,445
Stay focused.

121
00:10:20,051 --> 00:10:22,051
Let’s go now.

122
00:10:26,768 --> 00:10:29,242
Black, how do you want us to burn it?

123
00:10:29,242 --> 00:10:30,822
I think it should be a better way.

124
00:10:30,822 --> 00:10:32,301
What the f*ck is up now?

125
00:10:32,301 --> 00:10:34,482
Do you want us all to die here?

126
00:10:34,482 --> 00:10:36,482


127
00:11:23,841 --> 00:11:25,841
Try to keep up, Black.

128
00:11:34,315 --> 00:11:36,315
Take this.

129
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:56,479
Black, how do you want us to burn it?

130
00:11:58,976 --> 00:12:00,606
I think it should be a better way.

131
00:12:00,606 --> 00:12:02,098
What the f*ck is up now?

132
00:12:02,098 --> 00:12:03,151
You’ve been weird since we were at the garage.

133
00:12:03,151 --> 00:12:05,503
Yok, take it easy.

134
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:08,380
Do you want us all to die here?

135
00:12:13,268 --> 00:12:16,453
I’ll take the lead then. You follow us.

136
00:12:20,387 --> 00:12:23,290
Gram, Yok, I’ll deal with the furniture.

137
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:25,184
You try to connect each gas line.

138
00:12:25,184 --> 00:12:27,125
Sean, it’s a house with many stories.

139
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:28,888
Do you think we have enough gas?

140
00:12:28,888 --> 00:12:31,463
Start from the second floor and the fire will spread up.

141
00:12:31,463 --> 00:12:32,910
Come on.

142
00:12:33,676 --> 00:12:34,773
You, get moving.

143
00:12:34,773 --> 00:12:36,231
Let’s go, Black.

144
00:12:47,439 --> 00:12:49,439
Black, come here quickly.

145
00:12:50,558 --> 00:12:52,558
You take care of that side.

146
00:12:52,558 --> 00:12:54,128
Yok and Gram, follow me.

147
00:13:02,038 --> 00:13:04,038
You pour the gas from the stairs to here.

148
00:13:04,385 --> 00:13:09,766
You try to connect each piece of furniture so the fire won’t get discontinued.

149
00:13:09,766 --> 00:13:10,883
Come with me.

150
00:13:23,645 --> 00:13:25,645
Don’t step on it.

151
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,440
What are you doing?

152
00:13:49,707 --> 00:13:51,198
Nothing.

153
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:52,710
Did you take care of your area?

154
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:53,341
I did.

155
00:13:53,341 --> 00:13:54,577
Let’s go.

156
00:13:54,808 --> 00:13:57,458
Yok, grab the gallons and wait for me downstairs.

157
00:13:57,458 --> 00:13:58,259
Sure.

158
00:13:58,259 --> 00:14:01,292
Gram, keep pouring until you reach the staircase.

159
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:08,590
Hey, don’t step on it.

160
00:14:13,273 --> 00:14:15,273
Yok, quickly.

161
00:15:16,931 --> 00:15:18,931
Come on.

162
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:47,372
[Happy Forest, the new artwork in Tawi’s forest trespassing house.]

163
00:16:40,287 --> 00:16:43,282
Guys, there’s someone on the third floor.

164
00:16:43,282 --> 00:16:44,444
Who is it?

165
00:16:45,092 --> 00:16:46,211
Black!

166
00:16:47,827 --> 00:16:49,109
Black.

167
00:16:58,938 --> 00:17:01,571
Yok, did you see someone there?

168
00:17:01,571 --> 00:17:02,921
I think I did.

169
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:06,133
I’ll go help Black. You two rescue the one upstairs.

170
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:13,583
Let’s go, Yok.

171
00:17:16,498 --> 00:17:18,498
Gram, go to the back. There might be another way out.

172
00:17:19,025 --> 00:17:21,298
Yok, you go get the guy up there. I’ll find Black.

173
00:17:21,298 --> 00:17:22,726
Go!

174
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:25,500
Hey!

175
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:30,168
Are you okay?

176
00:18:30,168 --> 00:18:31,365
Wake up!

177
00:18:33,889 --> 00:18:35,403
Wake up!

178
00:18:38,312 --> 00:18:39,618
Come on.

179
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,194
You okay?

180
00:19:05,995 --> 00:19:07,995
Wake up!

181
00:19:17,863 --> 00:19:19,863
You all right?

182
00:19:27,856 --> 00:19:29,856
Black!

183
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Black!

184
00:19:41,719 --> 00:19:42,747
Let’s go.

185
00:19:45,818 --> 00:19:47,818
Black.

186
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:34,410
Are you all right?

187
00:20:42,691 --> 00:20:44,043
You okay?

188
00:20:49,819 --> 00:20:51,819
What are you doing here?

189
00:20:56,751 --> 00:20:58,751
Do you work for Tawi?

190
00:20:59,429 --> 00:21:01,429
No.

191
00:21:11,412 --> 00:21:13,412
Can I see your face?

192
00:21:17,881 --> 00:21:19,881
Hey!

193
00:21:47,901 --> 00:21:49,160
Black!

194
00:21:49,577 --> 00:21:52,015
Black, are you all right?

195
00:21:52,015 --> 00:21:54,319
You said no one was in the house.

196
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:56,884
No one would get hurt if we burned the house down.

197
00:21:56,884 --> 00:21:58,263
Easy there.

198
00:21:58,263 --> 00:22:00,067
I helped him out. He’s okay.

199
00:22:00,067 --> 00:22:02,628
I almost died. That guy almost died too.

200
00:22:02,628 --> 00:22:04,901
Who would take responsibility if someone died?

201
00:22:05,867 --> 00:22:07,867
We all take responsibility.

202
00:22:08,353 --> 00:22:10,906
And you’re the most responsible one.

203
00:22:13,192 --> 00:22:16,164
Because you're the one who planned this scheme, Black.

204
00:22:18,476 --> 00:22:22,999
I get that you’re being like this because you almost died.

205
00:22:22,999 --> 00:22:25,397
I'll give you one more shot.

206
00:22:27,966 --> 00:22:29,966
Act like Black that I used to know.

207
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,200
Is everything done, Yok?

208
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,750
We should move.

209
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:55,583
I quit.

210
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:57,583


211
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:25,333
Black, does your hand hurt?

212
00:23:26,815 --> 00:23:27,935
Let me see.

213
00:23:27,935 --> 00:23:28,810
Black!

214
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:30,375
Just let him go.

215
00:23:32,098 --> 00:23:33,222
Damn you, Gram!

216
00:23:33,222 --> 00:23:35,013
You said no one was in the house.

217
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:37,699
There was no one in when I checked. How the hell would I know?

218
00:23:37,699 --> 00:23:39,967
When I went in to save him, he was drawing some shit.

219
00:23:39,967 --> 00:23:42,154
Who is he? Is he one of Tawi’s employees?

220
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:43,029
I don’t know.

221
00:23:43,029 --> 00:23:44,314
He said no.

222
00:23:44,314 --> 00:23:45,985
Did he see your face?

223
00:23:49,176 --> 00:23:51,176
Damn it!

224
00:23:51,455 --> 00:23:53,407
You go and vanish our backup gasoline.

225
00:23:53,407 --> 00:23:55,382
Clean everything up nicely. Go!

226
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:01,116
Sean, what are we going to do?

227
00:24:01,116 --> 00:24:02,467
I don’t f*cking know!

228
00:24:24,478 --> 00:24:26,051
You said

229
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:28,618
you wouldn’t let anyone take advantage of you.

230
00:24:30,421 --> 00:24:32,421
So this is how you fight?

231
00:24:38,032 --> 00:24:43,045
I know that everyone isn’t truly equal under the law.

232
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:48,096
But what you’re doing is demolishing the law yourself.

233
00:24:49,674 --> 00:24:51,674
Why are you doing this?

234
00:25:07,581 --> 00:25:09,581
We are all leaving.

235
00:25:09,581 --> 00:25:11,165
Let’s get going.

236
00:25:16,259 --> 00:25:18,259
Is everything done, Yok?

237
00:25:20,904 --> 00:25:22,904
We should move.

238
00:25:23,049 --> 00:25:24,622
I quit.

239
00:25:43,511 --> 00:25:45,511
What the hell are you saying?

240
00:25:55,218 --> 00:25:58,778
Guys, let’s separate as we planned for now.

241
00:25:59,054 --> 00:26:01,097
We can’t risk being seen here.

242
00:26:07,294 --> 00:26:10,213
Black, come with me.

243
00:26:15,319 --> 00:26:17,319
Where does it hurt? Let me bandage you.

244
00:26:54,814 --> 00:26:56,814
Stop thinking about what just happened.

245
00:26:57,348 --> 00:26:59,266
I get that you were at the death’s door.

246
00:26:59,266 --> 00:27:00,937
Some words might have slipped out of your mouth.

247
00:27:08,598 --> 00:27:10,598
Look at the sunrise.

248
00:27:11,132 --> 00:27:14,423
It reminds me of the first day you taught me how to ride a motorbike.

249
00:27:14,935 --> 00:27:17,314
You trained me until dawn.

250
00:27:17,848 --> 00:27:20,895
If I couldn’t do it, you wouldn’t let me stop.

251
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,300
You told me to ride along the road

252
00:27:26,877 --> 00:27:28,877
and feel the freedom.

253
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:36,119
What are you doing?

254
00:27:37,042 --> 00:27:39,042
This arm too.

255
00:27:40,952 --> 00:27:42,952
Like you said.

256
00:27:43,416 --> 00:27:46,124
Freedom is the oxygen of the soul.

257
00:28:19,709 --> 00:28:21,453
Let’s paint inside the hole.

258
00:28:21,581 --> 00:28:23,219
Alright.

259
00:28:24,932 --> 00:28:27,723
[Fire breaks out at Tawi’s residence.]

260
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:35,108
Hey, are you going to sit there all day?

261
00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:44,783
Read this.

262
00:28:44,935 --> 00:28:46,222
What?

263
00:28:46,521 --> 00:28:49,651
Ah! The news on Tawi’s burned house.

264
00:28:49,651 --> 00:28:51,389
Is it this damaged?

265
00:28:52,436 --> 00:28:54,357
I think it got attacked by some people.

266
00:28:54,787 --> 00:28:57,385
It served him right. I’m so happy.

267
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:00,874
Yes, I bet you are happy because his house got burned.

268
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,742
Come here.

269
00:29:07,482 --> 00:29:09,482
What?

270
00:29:10,147 --> 00:29:14,455
Do you think these people are heroes or vigilantes?

271
00:29:16,925 --> 00:29:18,305
I don’t know.

272
00:29:18,305 --> 00:29:19,391
Just tell me.

273
00:29:19,391 --> 00:29:21,597
What’s the first thought that came into your mind?

274
00:29:21,597 --> 00:29:25,079
You want me to say ‘heroes,’ don’t you?

275
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:26,298
You and your friends think they are.

276
00:29:26,298 --> 00:29:28,146
I haven’t said that.

277
00:29:28,146 --> 00:29:29,526
Tell me.

278
00:29:29,737 --> 00:29:32,856
Let’s say ‘heroic vigilantes.’

279
00:29:33,365 --> 00:29:37,965
They punish bad guys who are above the law.

280
00:29:37,965 --> 00:29:40,723
Those horrible men deserved what they got.

281
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:42,025
Do you really think so?

282
00:29:42,025 --> 00:29:43,204
I do.

283
00:29:44,797 --> 00:29:46,797
Come to think of it,

284
00:29:46,797 --> 00:29:49,257
I will paint the fire here too.

285
00:29:50,245 --> 00:29:52,245
Go ahead.

286
00:30:13,855 --> 00:30:14,530
Excuse me.

287
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:15,497
Yes?

288
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:18,130
You have ink on your shirt.

289
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:21,046
What the heck?

290
00:30:21,046 --> 00:30:22,904
Don’t do that.

291
00:30:32,845 --> 00:30:34,845
That will do for now.

292
00:30:34,845 --> 00:30:36,166
Thank you.

293
00:30:36,828 --> 00:30:38,792
Is this your first time taking the test?

294
00:30:39,022 --> 00:30:39,996
It is.

295
00:30:39,996 --> 00:30:41,525
Have you been prepared?

296
00:30:41,991 --> 00:30:43,072
Not really.

297
00:30:43,072 --> 00:30:45,026
But I think I might do well.

298
00:30:45,624 --> 00:30:47,680
The written part is not so hard.

299
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,728
They’re testing your general knowledge.

300
00:30:49,728 --> 00:30:52,587
It would be great if you follow the news.

301
00:30:52,908 --> 00:30:54,258
Take the latest news, for example.

302
00:30:54,258 --> 00:30:56,181
The fire at Tawi’s house. Have you heard?

303
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,490
I have.

304
00:30:59,935 --> 00:31:01,218
What do you think?

305
00:31:07,736 --> 00:31:10,335
I’m not really sure.

306
00:31:10,876 --> 00:31:14,598
But I think they had a reason to do that.

307
00:31:18,262 --> 00:31:20,262
And you?

308
00:31:20,858 --> 00:31:22,858
I don’t think it’s just a fire.

309
00:31:22,858 --> 00:31:27,243
I think they meant to expose Tawi’s forest trespass.

310
00:31:27,787 --> 00:31:29,787
What made you think so?

311
00:31:29,787 --> 00:31:32,937
Burning a house in the middle of a forest specifically

312
00:31:32,937 --> 00:31:35,148
is totally a symbolic act.

313
00:31:35,148 --> 00:31:38,503
Don’t you think they used violence to solve the problem?

314
00:31:38,503 --> 00:31:40,064
Do you think it will work?

315
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:43,014
Without the fire, no one would care about the issue.

316
00:31:43,014 --> 00:31:45,115
The media are ignoring the topic.

317
00:31:45,436 --> 00:31:47,825
It’s just fire and no one got hurt.

318
00:31:48,124 --> 00:31:52,724
I wouldn’t do it myself though because I’m not ready to face what comes after.

319
00:31:57,423 --> 00:31:59,423
We need to distinguish it.

320
00:31:59,658 --> 00:32:03,644
I agree with them burning the house down to show a symbol.

321
00:32:03,986 --> 00:32:06,248
But what they did was also against the law.

322
00:32:06,248 --> 00:32:08,351
If they get caught, they need to defend themselves in court.

323
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,947
You’re straightforward.

324
00:32:12,947 --> 00:32:14,998
You speak up about what’s on your mind.

325
00:32:15,526 --> 00:32:17,163
I can say it now.

326
00:32:17,163 --> 00:32:20,219
But I can’t if I have to be super diplomatic.

327
00:32:20,454 --> 00:32:21,826
Otherwise, I won’t pass the test.

328
00:32:22,825 --> 00:32:23,949
It’s about time.

329
00:32:23,949 --> 00:32:25,380
What’s your building?

330
00:32:25,649 --> 00:32:26,623
This one.

331
00:32:26,858 --> 00:32:28,041
I’m going this way.

332
00:32:28,041 --> 00:32:29,095
Good luck.

333
00:32:49,563 --> 00:32:54,640
Which state was the site of an event that prompted Black Lives Matter protests?

334
00:32:55,857 --> 00:32:57,857
Minnesota.

335
00:32:59,393 --> 00:33:04,748
Long-Lin Laplae are varieties of which of the following fruits?

336
00:33:10,195 --> 00:33:12,195
I'll go with mango.

337
00:33:15,573 --> 00:33:17,573
Tell me everything that happened.

338
00:33:18,492 --> 00:33:23,045
Gram thinks Black said that because he was shocked after he was almost killed.

339
00:33:23,729 --> 00:33:25,851
Do you think it’s possible?

340
00:33:25,851 --> 00:33:27,851


341
00:33:49,728 --> 00:33:56,317
To me, nude drawings aren’t just about the precise shape
and right lights and shadows.

342
00:33:56,317 --> 00:34:01,535
One more important thing is the feeling between the drawer and the model.

343
00:34:01,535 --> 00:34:05,166
Try to look and observe what he feels.

344
00:34:05,166 --> 00:34:07,593
Observe what you are feeling too.

345
00:34:08,116 --> 00:34:12,906
Learn bit by bit and express that feeling in the lines you draw.

346
00:34:13,455 --> 00:34:16,919
If you can do it, your drawing will get a life.

347
00:34:16,919 --> 00:34:18,776
It won’t be lifeless.

348
00:34:52,076 --> 00:34:54,076
Yok.

349
00:34:54,804 --> 00:34:56,804
Who are you drawing?

350
00:35:23,664 --> 00:35:25,664
You said no one would get hurt if we burned the house down.

351
00:35:36,622 --> 00:35:38,622
How was it?

352
00:35:40,699 --> 00:35:42,699
There was someone in the house.

353
00:35:43,674 --> 00:35:45,973
Why didn’t you check before you burned it?

354
00:35:46,306 --> 00:35:47,581
And are you all okay?

355
00:35:47,581 --> 00:35:48,878
Is everything okay?

356
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:51,691
We all are except Black.

357
00:35:52,263 --> 00:35:53,897
He said he wanted to quit.

358
00:35:56,688 --> 00:35:58,355
What did the others say?

359
00:35:58,355 --> 00:36:02,104
Gram thinks Black said that because he was shocked after he was almost killed.

360
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,200
Do you think it’s possible?

361
00:36:08,132 --> 00:36:09,347
It is.

362
00:36:09,703 --> 00:36:11,433
But it’s weird.

363
00:36:11,433 --> 00:36:13,721
Black isn’t a guy who’s afraid to die.

364
00:36:13,935 --> 00:36:15,756
Maybe, he’s just a bragger.

365
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:18,201
He never really came close to dying before.

366
00:36:20,115 --> 00:36:22,115
But I know Black well.

367
00:36:22,437 --> 00:36:25,213
He doesn’t say anything just to be cool.

368
00:36:26,427 --> 00:36:28,427
What are we going to do?

369
00:36:29,093 --> 00:36:31,952
If he wants to quit, let him.

370
00:36:38,353 --> 00:36:41,282
Or you beg him to come back.

371
00:36:43,674 --> 00:36:45,674
No way.

372
00:37:07,879 --> 00:37:10,072
Heart rate of 50 bpm.

373
00:37:20,237 --> 00:37:22,237
Heart rate of 20 bpm.

374
00:37:26,115 --> 00:37:28,115
I need a defibrillator.

375
00:37:46,944 --> 00:37:51,607
(Whatever Black is facing, I’m facing it too.)

376
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:57,648
(Black’s heart reminds me that I can’t avoid reality.)

377
00:38:35,332 --> 00:38:38,236
What’s up with you? You look pale.

378
00:38:40,814 --> 00:38:42,814
You’re cold.

379
00:38:42,814 --> 00:38:44,016
Are you dying?

380
00:38:44,016 --> 00:38:45,216
Nosy.

381
00:38:45,216 --> 00:38:48,185
I asked you nicely. We haven’t seen you at the garage.

382
00:38:48,438 --> 00:38:50,463
Aren’t you coming back?

383
00:38:54,351 --> 00:38:59,127
I hate to say this but you’re the one who’s brought us all to this point.

384
00:38:59,702 --> 00:39:03,696
You lighted a fire in their hearts when they were afraid.

385
00:39:03,934 --> 00:39:07,418
You're going to abandon them like this now that their fire has been lit?

386
00:39:08,764 --> 00:39:10,764
It was just an idea.

387
00:39:12,935 --> 00:39:14,688
We have a meeting tomorrow at the garage.

388
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:16,456
Will I see you there?

389
00:39:17,125 --> 00:39:19,125
You will if I go.

390
00:39:20,851 --> 00:39:23,612
Don’t you even think I’ll come back again.

391
00:39:23,612 --> 00:39:25,829
I came because Gumpa asked me to.

392
00:39:43,802 --> 00:39:45,802
What the heck is wrong with him?

393
00:39:57,428 --> 00:39:59,428
(White, the hospital called.)

394
00:39:59,428 --> 00:40:01,656
(They said Black’s condition got worse.)

395
00:40:02,365 --> 00:40:03,580
(But he’s okay now.)

396
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:05,419
(We shouldn’t be worried.)

397
00:40:06,316 --> 00:40:07,745
Thank you.

398
00:40:07,745 --> 00:40:09,763
I was thinking about going to the hospital just now.

399
00:40:09,763 --> 00:40:11,909
(You don’t have to come. He’s all right now.)

400
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:14,389
By the way, are you free tomorrow?

401
00:40:14,389 --> 00:40:16,149
I need to ask you a favor.

402
00:40:34,314 --> 00:40:35,434
So how was it?

403
00:40:35,434 --> 00:40:38,777
You met his friends. Does any of them seem shady?

404
00:40:39,015 --> 00:40:42,803
No. They don’t even know Black got beaten up.

405
00:40:43,681 --> 00:40:47,604
No one seems fishy. None of them was surprised to see me.

406
00:40:47,835 --> 00:40:51,349
I’m wondering if they’re those who really injured Black.

407
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:57,902
Though, there’s one guy who doesn’t seem to get along with Black.

408
00:40:57,902 --> 00:40:59,637
It’s Sean.

409
00:40:59,637 --> 00:41:02,666
And the fire? What exactly was it?

410
00:41:03,187 --> 00:41:04,859
It was Black’s plan.

411
00:41:04,859 --> 00:41:05,964
Yeah?

412
00:41:06,223 --> 00:41:10,039
I think Tawi and Black hate each other.

413
00:41:10,515 --> 00:41:14,663
Tawi may have ordered his men to hurt Balck.

414
00:41:17,013 --> 00:41:19,013
Possibly.

415
00:41:20,988 --> 00:41:24,890
Hang out with them and you might find anything more to it.

416
00:41:25,139 --> 00:41:27,180
So you want me to teach you how to ride Black’s bike?

417
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:28,387
Yes.

418
00:41:28,387 --> 00:41:33,197
I know how to ride a motorbike, but not a big bike like this.

419
00:41:33,197 --> 00:41:35,509
That’s why I need your help.

420
00:41:38,778 --> 00:41:40,061
Hop on.

421
00:41:40,061 --> 00:41:41,353
Hop on what?

422
00:41:41,353 --> 00:41:43,224
Are you sure you can handle it?

423
00:41:44,023 --> 00:41:45,405
I am.

424
00:41:45,405 --> 00:41:46,834
Hop on.

425
00:41:47,153 --> 00:41:49,858
Black loves his ride so much.

426
00:41:49,858 --> 00:41:53,494
If you crash it, he will wake up and finish you.

427
00:41:54,081 --> 00:41:56,175
I won’t. Come on.

428
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:59,190
Grab me a helmet.

429
00:42:01,833 --> 00:42:05,616
First, you’ll need to hold a clutch lever, on the left.

430
00:42:05,616 --> 00:42:09,273
Then you shift gears and slowly let go of the clutch lever.

431
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:16,020
Continue riding in a circle.

432
00:42:17,766 --> 00:42:19,766
Hey, you can do it.

433
00:42:19,766 --> 00:42:21,210
I’m not really confident.

434
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:24,126
Why not? You can do it.

435
00:42:24,126 --> 00:42:26,501
Go 180-200 km/h and you’ll be used to it in no time.

436
00:42:26,501 --> 00:42:28,298
Are you insane?

437
00:42:29,603 --> 00:42:32,816
White, if you don’t want his pals to find out,

438
00:42:32,816 --> 00:42:35,096
you must learn to think like Black.

439
00:42:35,096 --> 00:42:38,868
Black has no fears or hesitations.

440
00:42:39,225 --> 00:42:42,898
If you’re like this, you’ll get busted.

441
00:42:43,275 --> 00:42:46,434
Stop and drop me off right there.

442
00:42:46,434 --> 00:42:48,434
And you continue riding.

443
00:42:52,804 --> 00:42:54,804
Try it.

444
00:43:08,128 --> 00:43:10,342
Are you headed to the garage?

445
00:43:10,532 --> 00:43:11,830
I’m not telling you.

446
00:43:14,307 --> 00:43:16,307
Who gets to the garage first wins.

447
00:43:17,291 --> 00:43:19,291
Hey! Wait up!

448
00:43:24,593 --> 00:43:27,092
(Freedom is the oxygen of the soul.)

449
00:43:27,092 --> 00:43:31,577
(I’m starting to get what Black said when my body feels the air.)

450
00:43:31,577 --> 00:43:35,629
(The faster I go, the stronger the drag force.)

451
00:43:35,629 --> 00:43:41,241
(What we did surely had a drag force we’re unable to avoid.)

452
00:44:20,665 --> 00:44:24,567
(Sometimes, I seek an explanation for every action.)

453
00:44:24,567 --> 00:44:27,855
(I believe everything happens for a reason.)

454
00:44:27,855 --> 00:44:33,778
(But this time I just can’t figure out what the guy behind me is thinking.)

455
00:44:36,726 --> 00:44:51,614
Directed by Anucha Boonyawatana

456
00:44:52,494 --> 00:44:56,115
You’ve been worse after the fire, Black.

457
00:44:56,115 --> 00:44:57,499
I feel like Black has changed.

458
00:44:58,616 --> 00:45:00,616
It’s not like him at all.

459
00:45:05,072 --> 00:45:08,522
Namo, you know street art. Have you heard of any artist named UNAR?

460
00:45:08,522 --> 00:45:11,404
UNAR’s work is about social criticism.

461
00:45:11,404 --> 00:45:14,646
His art is well-known and always goes viral.

462
00:45:14,646 --> 00:45:16,302
I want him to work with us.

463
00:45:16,659 --> 00:45:18,545
Just don’t ask for trouble.
