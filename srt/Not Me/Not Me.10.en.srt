3
00:00:18,108 --> 00:00:20,318
What’s going on between you and Black?

4
00:00:20,318 --> 00:00:21,847
It’s more than what I see, isn’t it?

5
00:00:21,847 --> 00:00:25,611
If I’m not the Black you used to know, will you be okay with that?

6
00:00:25,611 --> 00:00:27,921
I’ve never known you better than this before.

7
00:00:28,008 --> 00:00:29,620
Did you talk to Black?

8
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:31,317
Yes, so that he could get back with you.

9
00:00:31,317 --> 00:00:33,638
What you did says that I’m worthless.

10
00:00:33,638 --> 00:00:34,450
Black.

11
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:35,331
It’s me.

12
00:00:35,331 --> 00:00:36,756
Did you meet Todd?

13
00:00:36,756 --> 00:00:38,756
He’s the one that told me about you.

14
00:00:38,756 --> 00:00:41,253
That bastard Todd was the one that hurt me.

15
00:01:03,476 --> 00:01:05,476
[Todd]

16
00:01:05,476 --> 00:01:07,458
Speaking of the bastard.

17
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:08,736
Pick up.

18
00:01:09,059 --> 00:01:11,384
Don’t let him know you’re with me.

19
00:01:20,619 --> 00:01:21,832
(Hello.)

20
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:23,019
(Black woke up.)

21
00:01:23,019 --> 00:01:24,217
What?

22
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:26,368
Really? I’ll be right there.

23
00:01:26,368 --> 00:01:28,089
He disappeared from the hospital.

24
00:01:32,128 --> 00:01:33,608
How did that happen?

25
00:01:33,608 --> 00:01:35,060
No idea.

26
00:01:35,576 --> 00:01:37,881
I thought he’d go see you. That’s why I called.

27
00:01:37,881 --> 00:01:39,533
Why would he do that?

28
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:41,815
He doesn’t even know I’m back.

29
00:01:41,815 --> 00:01:43,642
When did he wake up?

30
00:01:44,112 --> 00:01:45,731
I don’t know.

31
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:47,187
The nurse called me.

32
00:01:47,187 --> 00:01:48,389
I called you right after that.

33
00:01:48,389 --> 00:01:50,239
Do you know where he might be?

34
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:51,355
I don’t.

35
00:01:51,355 --> 00:01:53,614
I haven’t talked to him in ages.

36
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:55,316
Where are you right now?

37
00:01:56,586 --> 00:01:57,768
His room.

38
00:01:57,768 --> 00:01:59,672
Good. Wait for him there.

39
00:01:59,672 --> 00:02:01,577
You’ll get to see him when he’s there.

40
00:02:01,577 --> 00:02:02,737
Sure.

41
00:02:02,737 --> 00:02:04,975
When he’s here, I’ll let you know.

42
00:02:09,548 --> 00:02:11,548
I’ll go see you at your place tomorrow.

43
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:12,893
Why?

44
00:02:12,893 --> 00:02:14,746
I told you to wait there.

45
00:02:14,746 --> 00:02:16,479
I think we need to talk about this.

46
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:17,906
Black disappeared.

47
00:02:17,906 --> 00:02:19,476
It can’t be good.

48
00:02:19,618 --> 00:02:22,454
Fine. Come see me at my place tomorrow.

49
00:02:22,454 --> 00:02:24,097
Let’s meet at nighttime.

50
00:02:24,097 --> 00:02:25,366
Okay.

51
00:02:37,167 --> 00:02:38,248
Where are you going?

52
00:02:38,248 --> 00:02:39,499
There are people guarding downstairs.

53
00:02:39,499 --> 00:02:40,480
I know that.

54
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,095
I’ll deal with them.

55
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:43,529
This place isn’t for you.

56
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:47,174
How do you know this isn’t my place?

57
00:02:47,174 --> 00:02:49,237
I’m part of the group too.

58
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:55,088
Are you sure they will accept you when they find out you’ve been lying from the start?

59
00:02:55,088 --> 00:02:56,490
Especially Sean.

60
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:53,981
(Now that Black has woken up, he became an evil doppelganger I don't know.)

61
00:03:53,981 --> 00:03:55,938
Go back to your own life.

62
00:03:56,268 --> 00:03:59,366
Do not get close to people in my gang again.

63
00:04:01,687 --> 00:04:04,002
(Black is taking back his life.)

64
00:04:04,002 --> 00:04:07,709
(And I have no other choice than to give it back to him.)

65
00:05:15,163 --> 00:05:16,249
Good afternoon.

66
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:18,026
Are you Ms. Metinee’s guest?

67
00:05:18,229 --> 00:05:19,010
I am.

68
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:20,988
This way, please.

69
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:29,966
(I never thought my last mission as Black would be talking to mom for him.)

70
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:37,563
(This time, I must do my best to be like Black

71
00:05:37,563 --> 00:05:42,283
in order to know what she really wants from my brother.)

72
00:05:43,271 --> 00:05:45,271
Have a seat.

73
00:05:50,954 --> 00:05:52,954
Let’s eat and talk.

74
00:05:55,247 --> 00:05:57,247
Do we even have anything left to talk about?

75
00:06:01,598 --> 00:06:04,233
I visited you at the hospital.

76
00:06:04,233 --> 00:06:07,059
You were in a coma. You didn’t know anything about that.

77
00:06:07,059 --> 00:06:12,067
What I’m saying is that a mother can’t really cut her child off.

78
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,880
Why did you sneak out of the hospital?

79
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,970
Why didn’t you wait until you’re fully recovered?

80
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:21,023
Are you afraid of being hunted down?

81
00:06:21,457 --> 00:06:23,667
Do you really believe

82
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:29,739
I was in a coma because I had a fight with some street scums?

83
00:06:30,658 --> 00:06:35,045
I don’t want to believe so but I let the authorities do their job.

84
00:06:35,045 --> 00:06:36,649
Look at your behavior.

85
00:06:36,649 --> 00:06:39,299
Why are you acting like a hooligan?

86
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:41,776
Though I wanted to help, I couldn't.

87
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:46,984
If I got involved, people would say I have a conflict of interest, using my connection to help my son.

88
00:06:46,984 --> 00:06:49,373
And you wouldn't like that, would you?

89
00:06:52,051 --> 00:06:56,133
You know it isn’t right but you just ignore the problem.

90
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,477
How do you even call yourself a justice keeper?

91
00:07:06,616 --> 00:07:08,616
Think whatever you like.

92
00:07:08,616 --> 00:07:10,924
Today I just came to warn you.

93
00:07:12,548 --> 00:07:15,157
You are going to die

94
00:07:15,987 --> 00:07:19,848
because you get yourself in something you’re not supposed to.

95
00:07:19,848 --> 00:07:21,581
Why am I dying?

96
00:07:21,581 --> 00:07:25,350
Because what you’re doing can’t change a thing.

97
00:07:25,474 --> 00:07:28,134
It will never change anything.

98
00:07:28,134 --> 00:07:29,287
Why can’t it change anything?

99
00:07:29,848 --> 00:07:32,116
Those guys are the ones dying.

100
00:07:32,116 --> 00:07:34,271
Do you know you will get nothing out of what you’re doing?

101
00:07:34,271 --> 00:07:39,409
Though you can take those guys down, there will be a new group of people replacing them always.

102
00:07:39,719 --> 00:07:41,960
It’s always been like that.

103
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,694
So you do know everything.

104
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:50,098
I also know you’re behind people who protested at Mr. Tawi’s company.

105
00:07:50,098 --> 00:07:53,322
I wasn’t behind anyone. People came at their own will.

106
00:07:53,322 --> 00:07:56,176
Think whatever suits you but it is surely not what those guys think.

107
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:59,797
They think it can’t be any uprising without someone backing them up.

108
00:08:00,076 --> 00:08:02,728
And if they can get rid of the backup,

109
00:08:02,728 --> 00:08:05,382
the protesters will disappear.

110
00:08:08,127 --> 00:08:10,127
How can they think that way?

111
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:12,268
It isn’t true.

112
00:08:12,776 --> 00:08:15,337
You’re being watched.

113
00:08:15,337 --> 00:08:17,219
What you’re doing is dangerous.

114
00:08:17,219 --> 00:08:22,125
The one you’re up against has money and power.

115
00:08:22,607 --> 00:08:25,437
If you stop now, things will be over.

116
00:08:25,437 --> 00:08:26,517
There’s no way.

117
00:08:26,517 --> 00:08:28,213
My friends and I aren’t behind them.

118
00:08:28,213 --> 00:08:30,213
People will rise no matter what you say.

119
00:08:30,213 --> 00:08:32,691
They now know how nasty he is.

120
00:08:32,691 --> 00:08:34,848
They think this cycle is over if they can take down Tawi.

121
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,476
It will never be over.

122
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:39,267
I’m warning you here.

123
00:08:39,267 --> 00:08:40,249
I don’t want to see you dead.

124
00:08:40,249 --> 00:08:42,061
You know too well that it’s wrong,

125
00:08:42,486 --> 00:08:44,610
yet you stand by and watch.

126
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:46,531
You’re a judge!

127
00:08:47,865 --> 00:08:52,683
What’s the point of being one if you can’t enhance justice?

128
00:08:54,377 --> 00:08:57,240
The society has its own balance.

129
00:08:58,332 --> 00:09:02,408
Everything happens for a reason.

130
00:09:05,254 --> 00:09:07,660
So you’re okay with what’s happening right now?

131
00:09:08,746 --> 00:09:10,746
I am.

132
00:09:10,746 --> 00:09:11,995
I’m happy.

133
00:09:12,938 --> 00:09:17,412
I think it’s as good as it gets.

134
00:09:19,593 --> 00:09:22,278
Then you have no right to ever teach me anything.

135
00:09:23,552 --> 00:09:29,016
Let’s consider this our final meeting then.

136
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,628
Everything we talked about today,

137
00:09:32,628 --> 00:09:34,526
pass it on to Black.

138
00:09:42,474 --> 00:09:44,144
I’m your mother, White.

139
00:09:44,144 --> 00:09:45,576
Of course, I can tell.

140
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:53,324
I’m never good at being Black.

141
00:09:54,467 --> 00:09:56,771
You can always tell.

142
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,625
White,

143
00:10:13,209 --> 00:10:15,758
do you realize what you’re up to?

144
00:10:15,758 --> 00:10:17,974
It is so dangerous.

145
00:10:17,974 --> 00:10:22,452
It’s like you’re wasting what your father and I have been doing for you for the past ten years.

146
00:10:24,934 --> 00:10:26,934
Stop using it as your excuse.

147
00:10:26,934 --> 00:10:29,536
You and dad couldn’t make it work anyway.

148
00:10:29,536 --> 00:10:31,134
I’ve always known it.

149
00:10:31,134 --> 00:10:35,583
Without the issue of Black and me, you two were separating anyway.

150
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:42,310
You must stop thinking about Black no matter what.

151
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:45,732
If you can stop thinking about him, there will be no connection,

152
00:10:45,732 --> 00:10:47,164
just like when you’re in Russia.

153
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:50,858
You don’t have to live a reckless life like Black.

154
00:10:52,328 --> 00:10:56,323
Though I’m not that close to you,

155
00:10:57,578 --> 00:11:00,696
I’m not ready to lose you too.

156
00:11:03,274 --> 00:11:05,274
I suppose you’ll have to live with that.

157
00:11:34,186 --> 00:11:35,450
Here.

158
00:11:36,052 --> 00:11:37,934
You can use this.

159
00:11:46,361 --> 00:11:48,006
It’s okay.

160
00:11:48,006 --> 00:11:49,350
I better use this wet wipe.

161
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:51,681
I don’t want to ruin your handkerchief.

162
00:11:52,265 --> 00:11:53,976
It’s okay too

163
00:11:53,976 --> 00:11:56,360
because I’m here to apologize.

164
00:11:56,599 --> 00:11:59,338
My thoughtless action got you mad.

165
00:12:01,253 --> 00:12:04,421
Forget it. It’s in the past.

166
00:12:08,181 --> 00:12:10,689
What was that dance?

167
00:12:11,095 --> 00:12:12,598
That?

168
00:12:12,852 --> 00:12:16,232
It was a performance about…

169
00:12:16,232 --> 00:12:17,808
beauty standard.

170
00:12:17,808 --> 00:12:24,349
My friends painted on my body to tell me about the flaws they find in me.

171
00:12:26,303 --> 00:12:28,303
Here.

172
00:12:28,303 --> 00:12:31,558
Write down the flaws that you see.

173
00:12:31,558 --> 00:12:33,792
You can write on my body, right here.

174
00:12:33,792 --> 00:12:35,010
Try it.

175
00:12:37,042 --> 00:12:39,042
I have no idea what to write

176
00:12:39,848 --> 00:12:44,419
because all of the things that make you up are all good to me.

177
00:12:46,145 --> 00:12:49,344
If you just said that to make me feel good,

178
00:12:49,344 --> 00:12:51,326
don’t bother.

179
00:12:57,236 --> 00:12:59,236
Fine. I’ll do it.

180
00:12:59,699 --> 00:13:01,699
Go ahead.

181
00:13:06,845 --> 00:13:08,845
There. It’s done.

182
00:13:08,845 --> 00:13:10,954
Let’s see.

183
00:13:10,954 --> 00:13:13,370
My flaw is…

184
00:13:14,309 --> 00:13:15,987
‘handful?’

185
00:13:17,482 --> 00:13:19,482
What do you mean?

186
00:13:19,482 --> 00:13:21,739
You’re a handful

187
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:24,869
but I’m handsome.

188
00:13:27,135 --> 00:13:28,729
Seriously?

189
00:13:28,729 --> 00:13:30,069
Seriously.

190
00:13:30,069 --> 00:13:33,446
People still say this joke these days?

191
00:13:34,423 --> 00:13:36,366
I wanted to make you smile.

192
00:13:36,366 --> 00:13:38,933
You look so much better with a smile.

193
00:13:43,058 --> 00:13:45,058
I like it when you smile.

194
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:55,063
Can I be the guy who makes you smile every day?

195
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:00,375
I’m sorry, Gram.

196
00:14:05,857 --> 00:14:07,629
I want to be alone.

197
00:14:07,629 --> 00:14:09,691
Can you please leave me be for now?

198
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:12,750
Sure.

199
00:14:17,224 --> 00:14:19,224
Bye now.

200
00:14:35,019 --> 00:14:36,892
I know a good cop.

201
00:14:36,892 --> 00:14:37,973
I guarantee it with my life.

202
00:14:37,973 --> 00:14:39,709
It’s someone willing to go against Tawi.

203
00:14:39,709 --> 00:14:40,750
You know what we’re doing.

204
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,600
I’ll even kick myself out of the gang too.

205
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,600


206
00:15:24,954 --> 00:15:26,304
Hi, Sean.

207
00:15:27,321 --> 00:15:30,147
Gumpa, can you be my sparring partner?

208
00:15:30,147 --> 00:15:32,216
Why training this early?

209
00:15:33,114 --> 00:15:35,114
I was being followed yesterday.

210
00:15:36,292 --> 00:15:37,260
How?

211
00:15:38,532 --> 00:15:40,419
They chased us by a car

212
00:15:40,419 --> 00:15:42,258
when Black and I were on the way here.

213
00:15:42,258 --> 00:15:44,246
I want to get this over with.

214
00:15:44,609 --> 00:15:45,969
What do you think?

215
00:15:45,969 --> 00:15:47,400
Or should we lie low for now?

216
00:15:47,943 --> 00:15:49,591
You’ve come this far.

217
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:52,994
Do you really think you can keep a low profile anymore?

218
00:15:54,467 --> 00:15:55,913
Do you?

219
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,032
Come on.

220
00:15:58,618 --> 00:15:59,716
Jab.

221
00:16:00,347 --> 00:16:01,214
1 2.

222
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:02,090
Straight punch.

223
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:02,905
Up.

224
00:16:02,905 --> 00:16:03,405
Hook.

225
00:16:03,405 --> 00:16:04,051
Straight punch.

226
00:16:04,051 --> 00:16:05,098
Four punches.

227
00:16:05,696 --> 00:16:07,696
Weave.

228
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:10,037
So, how was it?

229
00:16:10,324 --> 00:16:12,135
What did you find from the warehouse?

230
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:15,223
It’s always guarded.

231
00:16:15,395 --> 00:16:19,546
It is not easy to get in and take all the drugs out in the open.

232
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,700
If we can’t get in,

233
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,423
we must lure them out.

234
00:16:26,362 --> 00:16:27,846
How?

235
00:16:30,071 --> 00:16:32,071
Police can’t spot any prostitution in Pattaya,

236
00:16:32,071 --> 00:16:33,830
nor can they find any overpriced lottery tickets.

237
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:34,809
How do you think that happens?

238
00:16:34,809 --> 00:16:36,971
They know. Someone tells them in advance.

239
00:16:36,971 --> 00:16:37,860
Exactly.

240
00:16:38,605 --> 00:16:40,756
They can avoid the authorities because they’ve been warned,

241
00:16:40,756 --> 00:16:41,953
by someone on the inside.

242
00:16:41,953 --> 00:16:45,154
Do you truly think there aren't Tawi's rats among the authorities?

243
00:16:45,154 --> 00:16:46,872
We must align with a policeman.

244
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:49,730
He will report where Tawi stores the drugs.

245
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:52,817
And when the police file the search warrant,

246
00:16:52,817 --> 00:16:55,593
Tawi’s rats will let him know there’s a searching going on.

247
00:16:55,593 --> 00:16:57,371
Tawi must remove the drugs somewhere else.

248
00:16:57,667 --> 00:17:01,762
When that happens, we will hijack the drugs and expose him.

249
00:17:08,342 --> 00:17:09,902
Sean, don’t get distracted.

250
00:17:09,902 --> 00:17:11,250
Be careful and put your guards up.

251
00:17:11,575 --> 00:17:13,452
This plan involves police.

252
00:17:13,452 --> 00:17:14,648
Don’t we have any other plan?

253
00:17:14,648 --> 00:17:16,656
That’s all I can think of for now.

254
00:17:16,656 --> 00:17:19,988
We can never get inside and we don’t know when they’re gonna move the drugs.

255
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:21,966
We must have bait.

256
00:17:21,966 --> 00:17:23,101
I want nothing to do with the police.

257
00:17:23,101 --> 00:17:25,773
There must be one good cop out there.

258
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:29,956
I no longer have faith in the police.

259
00:17:35,212 --> 00:17:37,212
Jab.

260
00:17:37,633 --> 00:17:38,596
1 2.

261
00:17:39,398 --> 00:17:41,398
I know a good cop,

262
00:17:42,048 --> 00:17:44,947
someone willing to go against Tawi.

263
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:46,967
I want him to work with us.

264
00:17:47,355 --> 00:17:48,745
Are you out of your mind?

265
00:17:48,745 --> 00:17:50,407
You know what we’re doing.

266
00:17:50,407 --> 00:17:52,480
No cops can take it.

267
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,053
He can be trusted.

268
00:17:54,053 --> 00:17:55,610
He shares our ideology.

269
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:56,926
What makes you so sure?

270
00:17:56,926 --> 00:17:59,514
Remember the day we burned Tawi’s house and someone got stuck in there,

271
00:17:59,894 --> 00:18:01,866
the painter named UNAR?

272
00:18:02,325 --> 00:18:05,156
Did I not tell you to stay away from him?

273
00:18:05,814 --> 00:18:07,374
I just don’t like following your orders.

274
00:18:07,374 --> 00:18:08,867
Guys, calm down.

275
00:18:09,974 --> 00:18:11,974
You two, pieces of shit!

276
00:18:12,184 --> 00:18:15,142
Yok, tell us more about that cop.

277
00:18:15,142 --> 00:18:16,589
I met him.

278
00:18:16,589 --> 00:18:18,442
He isn’t just a graffiti artist.

279
00:18:18,743 --> 00:18:20,036
He’s a cop too.

280
00:18:20,036 --> 00:18:21,913
Don’t you risk other people too.

281
00:18:21,913 --> 00:18:24,905
Didn’t we all agree to take the risk together?

282
00:18:24,905 --> 00:18:26,201
Not this kind of risk.

283
00:18:26,201 --> 00:18:28,457
He’s a cop, an outsider.

284
00:18:28,457 --> 00:18:30,188
He’s bringing us all to hell.

285
00:18:32,399 --> 00:18:34,399
He’s trustworthy.

286
00:18:34,399 --> 00:18:35,952
I guarantee with my life.

287
00:18:35,952 --> 00:18:36,774
Hey!

288
00:18:36,774 --> 00:18:39,037
You know, I was tracked down today.

289
00:18:39,037 --> 00:18:42,486
If it wasn’t for his help, I’d get captured by now.

290
00:18:42,486 --> 00:18:44,050
Yok, take it easy.

291
00:18:44,394 --> 00:18:46,678
Let’s wait for everyone and decide together.

292
00:18:46,678 --> 00:18:49,876
If he does something suspicious, I’ll deal with him.

293
00:18:50,748 --> 00:18:52,748
I’ll even kick myself out of the gang too.

294
00:18:54,822 --> 00:18:56,057
Are you nuts?

295
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:58,768
Do you trust him that much?

296
00:18:59,655 --> 00:19:02,802
I won’t take him here with me if I don’t.

297
00:19:04,908 --> 00:19:06,908
Please come in.

298
00:19:12,607 --> 00:19:14,607
You, stop right there.

299
00:19:15,465 --> 00:19:17,465
Come any closer and I’ll beat the hell out of you.

300
00:19:20,782 --> 00:19:22,782
Just come in.

301
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:28,211
Sean!

302
00:19:28,886 --> 00:19:30,116
Relax.

303
00:19:30,116 --> 00:19:31,540
Hear what he has to say.

304
00:19:35,381 --> 00:19:36,865
Yok, you asshole.

305
00:19:36,865 --> 00:19:39,773
This is UNAR or Dan, a police sub-lieutenant.

306
00:19:40,366 --> 00:19:42,685
This is Gumpa, the garage owner.

307
00:19:42,685 --> 00:19:44,388
And this is Sean.

308
00:19:44,388 --> 00:19:45,934
Just take your friend away.

309
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,619
I’ll wait outside.

310
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:48,582
Don’t.

311
00:19:48,847 --> 00:19:50,006
Stay.

312
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:53,063
Gumpa?

313
00:19:54,002 --> 00:19:55,505
It’s just my proposal.

314
00:19:55,505 --> 00:19:57,495
Take it or leave it, that’s up to you.

315
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:00,450
If you oppose,

316
00:20:02,698 --> 00:20:04,698
then you’re up for a challenge.

317
00:20:04,698 --> 00:20:06,125
That’s what you want?

318
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:07,022
Yes.

319
00:20:07,366 --> 00:20:08,788
Bring it.

320
00:20:14,022 --> 00:20:15,793
It’s a 3-point game.

321
00:20:15,793 --> 00:20:18,626
Whoever falls and hand touches the ground loses one point.

322
00:20:18,626 --> 00:20:19,675
Ready?

323
00:20:20,133 --> 00:20:20,633
You?

324
00:20:20,633 --> 00:20:21,558
Yes.

325
00:20:21,558 --> 00:20:22,490
Box.

326
00:20:25,756 --> 00:20:27,450
You know I hate cops.

327
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:28,555
That’s a prejudice against him.

328
00:20:28,555 --> 00:20:29,564
Just give him a chance.

329
00:20:46,015 --> 00:20:47,098
That’s all you got?

330
00:20:47,098 --> 00:20:48,314
Come on then.

331
00:20:58,927 --> 00:20:59,914
Bring it.

332
00:21:07,503 --> 00:21:08,872
One point for Yok.

333
00:21:12,362 --> 00:21:13,756
Come on.

334
00:21:26,477 --> 00:21:27,846
Yok’s got two points.

335
00:21:27,846 --> 00:21:28,984
Come forward.

336
00:22:02,465 --> 00:22:03,605
Sean, don’t!

337
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:11,874
Are we done here?

338
00:22:27,019 --> 00:22:28,331
Yok.

339
00:22:37,077 --> 00:22:38,542
Are you alright?

340
00:22:39,471 --> 00:22:40,756
Let me help you up.

341
00:22:40,756 --> 00:22:41,941
I’ll take you to a hospital.

342
00:23:01,425 --> 00:23:03,425
Do you think I can’t tell what it is between you and Black?

343
00:23:04,488 --> 00:23:06,947
You two have changed a lot.

344
00:23:06,947 --> 00:23:09,266
Do you remember our promise?

345
00:23:09,266 --> 00:23:11,266


346
00:23:38,695 --> 00:23:40,695
No pulling punches, huh?

347
00:23:41,354 --> 00:23:43,354
He challenged me.

348
00:23:43,354 --> 00:23:46,922
Some of my tests can’t be applied to everything.

349
00:23:47,598 --> 00:23:51,364
I know Yok lost and you won’t follow his instructions.

350
00:23:52,316 --> 00:23:54,449
But think about it.

351
00:23:54,449 --> 00:23:56,562
That guy was bold enough to declare he’s a cop.

352
00:23:56,562 --> 00:24:00,243
He walked in not knowing if you guys would take him in.

353
00:24:00,958 --> 00:24:03,417
Can’t that prove anything?

354
00:24:04,162 --> 00:24:10,017
Don't you think having one more person on your team increases your chances of winning?

355
00:24:10,017 --> 00:24:12,317
That’s why you’re formed as a team,

356
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:13,809
doing your missions together.

357
00:24:15,951 --> 00:24:19,051
Trust takes time.

358
00:24:19,464 --> 00:24:21,464
If you don’t open your heart,

359
00:24:21,464 --> 00:24:23,691
you’ll never know what kind of man he really is.

360
00:24:29,388 --> 00:24:33,126
I just want to talk to Black first and see what he thinks.

361
00:24:35,456 --> 00:24:37,456
You guys are not on the opposite sides anymore?

362
00:24:38,046 --> 00:24:39,665
You’ve changed so much.

363
00:24:39,665 --> 00:24:41,439
Two heads are better than one.

364
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:44,776
And Black is much more reasonable than before.

365
00:24:44,776 --> 00:24:46,625
I guess so.

366
00:24:46,625 --> 00:24:48,244
You’ve been spending all your time with him.

367
00:24:48,244 --> 00:24:50,362
You don’t consult with me anymore.

368
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:52,857
Are you sulking?

369
00:24:52,857 --> 00:24:54,134
I’m not.

370
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,814
If we go combative, expose their drug trafficking,

371
00:24:58,814 --> 00:25:00,343
and yet we can’t take them all down,

372
00:25:00,715 --> 00:25:02,715
we’re all dead.

373
00:25:02,715 --> 00:25:05,027
Are you ready to trade your life for it?

374
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:18,990
Taking you long enough to answer.

375
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:21,131
You normally don’t take so long.

376
00:25:21,763 --> 00:25:23,763
Long what?

377
00:25:24,751 --> 00:25:27,444
Do you have someone you want to live with now?

378
00:25:27,444 --> 00:25:29,379
That’s why you don’t want to give up your life.

379
00:25:31,731 --> 00:25:33,126
What are you talking about?

380
00:25:33,126 --> 00:25:35,420
Do you think I can’t tell what it is between you and Black?

381
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,735
Huh?

382
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:39,834
You two have changed a lot.

383
00:25:48,126 --> 00:25:50,126
I don’t think I can live without him.

384
00:25:52,831 --> 00:25:54,831
And if you’re the one that dies,

385
00:25:54,831 --> 00:25:56,160
then what?

386
00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:03,810
Have you told him about your feelings?

387
00:26:06,861 --> 00:26:08,861
I haven’t.

388
00:26:09,341 --> 00:26:11,709
I’m sure he knows.

389
00:26:11,709 --> 00:26:13,811
No. It isn’t the same.

390
00:26:14,148 --> 00:26:19,205
Before you trade your life for anything, you two must deal with your feelings first.

391
00:26:19,205 --> 00:26:21,243
Don’t regret it later.

392
00:26:47,322 --> 00:26:51,005
(Even though he and I have been through so much together,)

393
00:26:51,566 --> 00:26:57,557
(I'm not sure if he'll give a chance to someone who started it all on lies.)

394
00:27:10,251 --> 00:27:12,251
Let’s play a game.

395
00:27:12,251 --> 00:27:13,409
What game?

396
00:27:13,893 --> 00:27:16,018
A drinking game.

397
00:27:16,018 --> 00:27:18,329
‘Have you ever’ questions.

398
00:27:18,329 --> 00:27:20,367
If you have, you drink.

399
00:27:20,367 --> 00:27:22,037
We can’t get drunk up here.

400
00:27:22,037 --> 00:27:23,718
We might fall and die.

401
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:26,977
Are you scared?

402
00:27:27,326 --> 00:27:30,536
You didn’t seem scared at all when we were just together.

403
00:27:31,529 --> 00:27:33,529
Fine. I’ll play.

404
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:36,210
Have you ever tried getting on my nerves?

405
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,279
Have you ever been short-sighted?

406
00:27:45,712 --> 00:27:48,654
Yes. I’m still short-sighted.

407
00:27:54,628 --> 00:27:56,628
Have you ever tied me up?

408
00:28:03,321 --> 00:28:05,321
Have you ever had a sibling?

409
00:28:13,348 --> 00:28:14,989
You must be honest.

410
00:28:14,989 --> 00:28:16,493
Otherwise, it’s no fun.

411
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:29,948
Have you ever disliked me?

412
00:28:39,438 --> 00:28:41,438
So you used to dislike me.

413
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,660
Does it mean you like me now?

414
00:28:46,333 --> 00:28:47,809
Hm?

415
00:28:49,187 --> 00:28:51,187
You must be honest.

416
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:52,892
Otherwise, it’s no fun.

417
00:29:03,478 --> 00:29:06,847
Do you like to kiss with your eyes closed or opened?

418
00:29:07,638 --> 00:29:09,118
Closed.

419
00:29:14,244 --> 00:29:16,244
(I finally lost the game because I lied.)

420
00:29:16,244 --> 00:29:22,449
(Actually, opening my eyes to see my lover in front of me so near

421
00:29:22,449 --> 00:29:27,046
while our faces are touching is a special angle reserved for me only.)

422
00:29:29,356 --> 00:29:32,994
(But does he still trust a liar like me?)

423
00:29:55,697 --> 00:29:57,136
Black.

424
00:29:57,136 --> 00:29:58,902
What’s up, Sean?

425
00:29:58,902 --> 00:30:02,373
I know now what I’ll ask from the loser.

426
00:30:03,458 --> 00:30:05,458
You must come see me tonight.

427
00:30:05,458 --> 00:30:06,960
I will say it in front of you.

428
00:30:07,366 --> 00:30:08,850
Where?

429
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:10,091
Share with me the location.

430
00:30:10,865 --> 00:30:13,056
I also have something to tell you.

431
00:30:13,056 --> 00:30:14,064
Um.

432
00:31:02,975 --> 00:31:04,975
You’re early.

433
00:31:06,057 --> 00:31:08,057
I got free time.

434
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,842
What do you want to say to me?

435
00:31:14,916 --> 00:31:16,243
You first.

436
00:31:16,243 --> 00:31:17,624
You asked me here.

437
00:31:23,289 --> 00:31:25,670
Do you remember our promise?

438
00:31:30,209 --> 00:31:33,402
I can ask you for anything.

439
00:31:33,402 --> 00:31:35,400
I’ve figured it out.

440
00:31:46,875 --> 00:31:48,875
Can I ask you to be with me,

441
00:31:49,189 --> 00:31:51,903
stay by my side forever?

442
00:32:19,844 --> 00:32:21,844
That’s my answer.

443
00:32:25,057 --> 00:32:27,057
Black.

444
00:32:28,126 --> 00:32:30,126
I hope you get it.

445
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,410
I don’t get it.

446
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:40,961
If it isn’t necessary, do not come near me.

447
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,626
Let go.

448
00:32:44,495 --> 00:32:45,732
Black.

449
00:32:52,257 --> 00:32:53,584
Fight me.

450
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,640
Black.

451
00:33:00,567 --> 00:33:02,230
Why don’t you fight?

452
00:33:04,843 --> 00:33:06,843
Fight me.

453
00:33:08,664 --> 00:33:09,879
Fight me.

454
00:33:12,534 --> 00:33:14,040
Why are you not fighting?

455
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,317
Do it.

456
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,474
Black.

457
00:33:27,343 --> 00:33:28,670
Fight me.

458
00:33:40,655 --> 00:33:42,049
Fight me.

459
00:34:34,502 --> 00:34:36,502
I want the cop in.

460
00:34:36,502 --> 00:34:37,777
Are you sure?

461
00:34:37,777 --> 00:34:39,867
I will sneak in and take pictures of the drugs in Tawi’s warehouse.

462
00:34:39,867 --> 00:34:41,286
You use them to open an investigation case.

463
00:34:41,286 --> 00:34:42,287
Don’t worry.

464
00:34:42,287 --> 00:34:45,980
No hush money can make this case disappear.

465
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,980


466
00:35:33,841 --> 00:35:35,241
Sean.

467
00:35:43,343 --> 00:35:44,856
What have you done?

468
00:35:45,026 --> 00:35:47,146
Why are you looking like this?

469
00:35:51,831 --> 00:35:53,831
Black left me.

470
00:35:57,972 --> 00:35:59,291
Damn you.

471
00:35:59,291 --> 00:36:01,291
What an asshole.

472
00:36:02,044 --> 00:36:05,769
You came knowing how I feel about you.

473
00:36:06,471 --> 00:36:08,471
I am sorry.

474
00:36:12,082 --> 00:36:14,082
You must feel really bad.

475
00:36:16,805 --> 00:36:18,805
Being so emotional, huh?

476
00:36:18,805 --> 00:36:21,669
How old are you? Why letting yourself so down?

477
00:36:38,748 --> 00:36:40,748
Come on.

478
00:36:40,748 --> 00:36:42,414
Wake up.

479
00:36:42,414 --> 00:36:44,660
That pain won’t kill you.

480
00:36:45,393 --> 00:36:46,614
Take it.

481
00:36:46,614 --> 00:36:49,063
If you want to get better, vent it out.

482
00:36:49,063 --> 00:36:51,410
I did it too when you hurt me.

483
00:36:51,629 --> 00:36:54,423
Come on. Get up.

484
00:36:56,033 --> 00:36:58,033
Stop acting crazy.

485
00:37:15,514 --> 00:37:17,514
[F*cking asshole.]

486
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:30,252
[What the hell is up with you?]

487
00:38:38,541 --> 00:38:43,437
[You’re heartless.]

488
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:41,586
Yok.

489
00:39:47,472 --> 00:39:49,034
I’m sorry.

490
00:39:49,034 --> 00:39:50,630
I was playing too hard.

491
00:39:54,357 --> 00:39:55,603
Sure.

492
00:39:56,489 --> 00:39:58,489
What the hell happened to your face?

493
00:39:58,489 --> 00:40:00,773
Did you make someone mad?

494
00:40:02,231 --> 00:40:03,793
I made myself mad.

495
00:40:03,793 --> 00:40:05,270
Moron.

496
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:08,320
If you make yourself mad again, let me know.

497
00:40:08,529 --> 00:40:10,529
I’ll be the one beating you up.

498
00:40:14,576 --> 00:40:16,673
I want the cop in.

499
00:40:18,612 --> 00:40:19,931
Are you sure?

500
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,033
Have you talked to Black?

501
00:40:22,033 --> 00:40:23,332
Screw him.

502
00:40:23,332 --> 00:40:25,935
We work as a team. Why don’t you guys talk first?

503
00:40:26,105 --> 00:40:27,633
He doesn’t want to do this.

504
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:29,331
I’m making the decision here.

505
00:40:29,807 --> 00:40:31,747
I want to get this over with.

506
00:40:31,747 --> 00:40:33,282
What are you two fighting about this time?

507
00:40:33,282 --> 00:40:34,885
Forget about him.

508
00:40:34,885 --> 00:40:36,745
Go get the cop.

509
00:40:37,426 --> 00:40:39,318
We’re making the plan tonight.

510
00:40:43,198 --> 00:40:45,198
Fine.

511
00:40:56,926 --> 00:41:01,530
We can see now that Tawi is losing.

512
00:41:02,257 --> 00:41:04,257
Protesters are everywhere.

513
00:41:05,993 --> 00:41:11,881
If there’s a scandal big enough to make people so angry with him,

514
00:41:12,197 --> 00:41:13,706
he will surely collapse.

515
00:41:14,168 --> 00:41:16,332
This plan isn’t like our previous ones.

516
00:41:16,332 --> 00:41:18,917
Our targets aren’t just Tawi.

517
00:41:18,917 --> 00:41:21,140
It’s all people in his network.

518
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:24,861
We will expose their drug trafficking to the public so they can’t deny it.

519
00:41:25,879 --> 00:41:28,252
Maybe we don’t need to do anything.

520
00:41:28,252 --> 00:41:29,656
A lot of people are protesting against him.

521
00:41:29,656 --> 00:41:31,279
He can’t carry on for long.

522
00:41:31,279 --> 00:41:33,572
If you don’t want in, like Black,

523
00:41:33,572 --> 00:41:34,966
I don’t mind.

524
00:41:34,966 --> 00:41:36,734
I’m not saying I don't want in.

525
00:41:36,734 --> 00:41:38,568
But we can just join the protest.

526
00:41:38,568 --> 00:41:40,386
It’s changing the method.

527
00:41:40,879 --> 00:41:42,879
I’m not changing it.

528
00:41:42,879 --> 00:41:44,210
I’m doing it this way.

529
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,277
People can protest.

530
00:41:46,277 --> 00:41:48,192
We can proceed our own way.

531
00:41:49,046 --> 00:41:49,546
Fine.

532
00:41:49,546 --> 00:41:50,769
Let’s do what you say.

533
00:41:50,769 --> 00:41:53,397
We’ve walked this far. We must go all the way.

534
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:57,744
I will sneak in and take pictures of the drugs in Tawi’s warehouse.

535
00:41:58,304 --> 00:42:02,801
You use them as a lead to open an investigation case.

536
00:42:03,081 --> 00:42:04,929
When the police know there’s an investigation going on,

537
00:42:04,929 --> 00:42:06,971
they will tell Tawi to relocate the drugs.

538
00:42:06,971 --> 00:42:10,636
That’s when we’re gonna steal his drug-smuggling trucks.

539
00:42:10,636 --> 00:42:12,817
If the police don’t do anything after that,

540
00:42:12,817 --> 00:42:14,878
we will leave it for people to judge.

541
00:42:14,878 --> 00:42:16,027
Don’t worry.

542
00:42:16,027 --> 00:42:18,067
I know someone whom we can rely on.

543
00:42:18,067 --> 00:42:20,335
No hush money can make this case disappear.

544
00:42:21,868 --> 00:42:24,100
Hope you can do it like you just said.

545
00:42:47,316 --> 00:42:51,311
So the first step is to take photos of the drugs in the warehouse.

546
00:42:51,559 --> 00:42:53,313
Are you going in there yourself?

547
00:42:54,116 --> 00:42:57,206
Didn’t you just say there’re lots of guards?

548
00:42:57,206 --> 00:42:58,651
We should use Black.

549
00:42:58,651 --> 00:43:00,801
He’s the best at being sneaky.

550
00:43:00,801 --> 00:43:02,257
I don’t want him to be part of it.

551
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:04,321
I’ll do it myself.

552
00:43:05,221 --> 00:43:07,842
Are you having a problem with him?

553
00:43:07,842 --> 00:43:10,876
I’m here to talk about the mission, not personal stuff.

554
00:43:10,876 --> 00:43:13,027
But if your personal stuff affects the mission,

555
00:43:13,027 --> 00:43:14,420
we sure need to talk about it.

556
00:43:36,721 --> 00:43:38,721
Why don’t we wait for him?

557
00:43:38,721 --> 00:43:40,200
What’s the fight all about?

558
00:43:42,147 --> 00:43:44,147
Guys, watch out!

559
00:44:11,155 --> 00:44:12,011
Gram.

560
00:44:12,011 --> 00:44:13,415
Gram, the smoke bombs.

561
00:44:21,127 --> 00:44:22,057
Gram!

562
00:44:22,057 --> 00:44:23,640
Use the smoke bombs!

563
00:44:49,388 --> 00:44:51,388
Sean.

564
00:45:02,721 --> 00:45:03,761
Yok.

565
00:45:20,927 --> 00:45:22,294
Guys, run!

566
00:45:22,294 --> 00:45:23,518
Yok, come on.

567
00:45:25,177 --> 00:45:27,177
Yok, you first.

568
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,920
Sean.

569
00:46:36,614 --> 00:46:38,081
Let’s go.

570
00:46:39,959 --> 00:46:41,229
Let’s go.

571
00:46:44,269 --> 00:46:48,532
Directed by Anucha Boonyawatana

572
00:46:54,102 --> 00:46:55,591
You left me.

573
00:46:55,591 --> 00:46:57,297
Why did you come back?

574
00:46:57,297 --> 00:46:59,293
Isn’t what I’m doing clear enough to you?

575
00:46:59,293 --> 00:47:01,746
I want an explanation.

576
00:47:01,746 --> 00:47:02,867
Bandage me.

577
00:47:02,867 --> 00:47:04,169
Let’s go to a hospital.

578
00:47:04,169 --> 00:47:06,145
This is a gunshot wound.

579
00:47:06,145 --> 00:47:08,255
You’re not like the Black that I love.

580
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:10,509
It’s been a long time since our last visit here.

581
00:47:10,509 --> 00:47:12,809
Yeah, since I knew you were not different from Tawi.
