3
00:00:17,908 --> 00:00:19,452
I know a good cop.

4
00:00:19,452 --> 00:00:20,480
You, stop right there.

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,102
He can be trusted.

6
00:00:22,102 --> 00:00:24,281
If you oppose,	then you’re up for a challenge.

7
00:00:25,454 --> 00:00:27,937
You two have changed a lot.

8
00:00:31,007 --> 00:00:32,252
Fight me.

9
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,415
Let’s go, Sean.

10
00:00:50,726 --> 00:00:51,772
Come on.

11
00:00:53,323 --> 00:00:55,323
Wait! Where is Sean?

12
00:00:55,323 --> 00:00:57,047
Shit! You guys go ahead.

13
00:00:57,047 --> 00:00:58,422
I’ll go get Sean.

14
00:01:00,341 --> 00:01:01,009
Damn it!

15
00:01:01,009 --> 00:01:01,986
Wait for me.

16
00:01:15,929 --> 00:01:17,929
Sean, Black.

17
00:01:18,207 --> 00:01:19,256
Sean!

18
00:01:19,674 --> 00:01:20,627
Sean.

19
00:01:21,542 --> 00:01:22,289
Let’s go.

20
00:01:22,289 --> 00:01:23,200
They are coming.

21
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,348
Follow me.

22
00:01:24,467 --> 00:01:25,424
Let’s go.

23
00:01:27,344 --> 00:01:29,344
Come on, Yok.

24
00:01:34,338 --> 00:01:35,920
Let’s separate. We have a better chance of surviving.

25
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,335
Gram, come with me.

26
00:03:38,076 --> 00:03:40,097
Have a seat, White.

27
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,960
Do you want a drink?

28
00:04:32,186 --> 00:04:34,186
I think we are safe now.

29
00:04:37,881 --> 00:04:39,881
Where should we go?

30
00:04:40,983 --> 00:04:41,890
Hey!

31
00:04:46,598 --> 00:04:48,598
You’re bleeding.

32
00:04:48,598 --> 00:04:49,968
Did you get shot?

33
00:04:50,525 --> 00:04:52,336
Why didn’t you tell me sooner

34
00:04:52,336 --> 00:04:53,826
so I could take you to a hospital?

35
00:04:55,073 --> 00:04:55,960
No.

36
00:04:56,801 --> 00:04:58,801
I’m all right.

37
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,811
Go to the abandoned building.

38
00:05:17,621 --> 00:05:19,621
Where are you taking me?

39
00:05:19,621 --> 00:05:21,706
That building you took me.

40
00:05:22,968 --> 00:05:24,968
I don’t want to go. Stop the bike now.

41
00:05:24,968 --> 00:05:28,032
Then where? We can’t go back to the garage.

42
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:30,954
Anywhere I don’t have to see your face.

43
00:05:30,954 --> 00:05:31,634
Pull over.

44
00:05:31,634 --> 00:05:32,504
I said pull over.

45
00:05:32,504 --> 00:05:34,806
What the hell is wrong with you, Sean?

46
00:05:35,149 --> 00:05:36,553
I told you to stop.

47
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:38,125
Stop!

48
00:05:38,657 --> 00:05:40,061
You stop it.

49
00:05:40,061 --> 00:05:40,958
We don’t want to crash.

50
00:05:43,858 --> 00:05:45,639
You just got shot.

51
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:47,057
Why are you acting crazy here?

52
00:05:47,325 --> 00:05:49,325
You’re the crazy one.

53
00:05:49,325 --> 00:05:52,103
You told me to never come near you again.

54
00:05:55,827 --> 00:05:57,390
You already left me.

55
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,199
Why did you come back to save me?

56
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,247
Why didn’t you let me get killed?

57
00:06:04,509 --> 00:06:06,231
I told you to stop the bike.

58
00:06:06,231 --> 00:06:06,997
Pull over!

59
00:06:07,255 --> 00:06:08,814
Or I will jump off it.

60
00:06:14,683 --> 00:06:16,683
If you jump, we will crash together.

61
00:06:37,673 --> 00:06:39,037
You haven’t found Black?

62
00:06:39,037 --> 00:06:40,692
Doesn’t he go back to his place at all?

63
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,917
I’d waited for him all day but he didn’t show up.

64
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,780
I sent my men to track down his friends

65
00:06:54,794 --> 00:06:57,164
and see if he’s with one of them.

66
00:06:59,937 --> 00:07:01,937
Where would he run away to?

67
00:07:10,212 --> 00:07:12,212
Run away?

68
00:07:13,415 --> 00:07:15,415
He is not the type of man who would do such a thing.

69
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:18,311
When he wakes up,

70
00:07:19,855 --> 00:07:22,549
the first thing he'll do is seek revenge.

71
00:07:23,528 --> 00:07:25,606
He must want to see the one who put him in that situation.

72
00:07:28,547 --> 00:07:30,547
That’s me. Am I right, Black?

73
00:07:44,778 --> 00:07:46,778
Do you want a drink?

74
00:08:13,486 --> 00:08:15,486
Black.

75
00:08:21,485 --> 00:08:23,485
Black.

76
00:08:28,488 --> 00:08:29,474
Black.

77
00:08:30,145 --> 00:08:32,003
Black, what’s the matter?

78
00:08:45,071 --> 00:08:47,071
Black, what’s happening to you?

79
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:48,803
Black.

80
00:08:53,255 --> 00:08:55,255
When was the last time you visited here?

81
00:08:55,255 --> 00:08:57,502
When I found out you're not different than Tawi.

82
00:08:57,502 --> 00:08:58,625
Bandage me.

83
00:08:58,625 --> 00:08:59,976
Let’s go to a hospital.

84
00:08:59,976 --> 00:09:01,885
This is a gunshot wound!

85
00:09:01,885 --> 00:09:03,885


86
00:09:47,178 --> 00:09:49,178
Injured every day.

87
00:09:50,334 --> 00:09:52,073
I’ll get used to it.

88
00:09:52,073 --> 00:09:53,773
Did you have a fight with your new friends?

89
00:09:53,773 --> 00:09:54,583
Yes.

90
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:59,393
They celebrated big time they could make waves and blow the university chancellor off.

91
00:09:59,568 --> 00:10:01,516
It's not quite over.

92
00:10:01,793 --> 00:10:03,932
New issues will surface in the days to come.

93
00:10:03,932 --> 00:10:07,073
It will keep going like this if we don’t learn from the past.

94
00:10:07,435 --> 00:10:09,868
So I kind of…went off.

95
00:10:13,858 --> 00:10:15,858
You’re an aggressive dog.

96
00:10:40,419 --> 00:10:46,270
Todd, I’m sure it isn’t just us who do all these things.

97
00:10:48,992 --> 00:10:52,558
I’ve seen people who try to make things better.

98
00:10:52,673 --> 00:10:54,673
I see what others don’t.

99
00:10:54,801 --> 00:10:56,255
I see changes.

100
00:10:56,702 --> 00:10:58,411
Think about it.

101
00:10:59,113 --> 00:11:01,417
What if this isn’t limited to a university.

102
00:11:01,417 --> 00:11:03,175
What if we take it to the social stage,

103
00:11:03,175 --> 00:11:04,792
national stage.

104
00:11:04,792 --> 00:11:11,313
I’m seeing a picture of many people rising to demolish the old structure.

105
00:11:11,313 --> 00:11:13,929
They are building the new world that really belongs to us all.

106
00:11:15,644 --> 00:11:17,644
You’re talking about utopia.

107
00:11:17,644 --> 00:11:19,107
It will never happen

108
00:11:19,532 --> 00:11:21,673
unless there’s a massacre.

109
00:11:21,673 --> 00:11:23,786
Take Martin Luther King as an example.

110
00:11:23,786 --> 00:11:27,046
He battled with non-violence and civil disobedience.

111
00:11:27,493 --> 00:11:28,814
He won.

112
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:29,652
So?

113
00:11:29,652 --> 00:11:34,070
Martin Luther King got assassinated in the end.

114
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:38,063
I’m worried about you here, Black.

115
00:11:39,105 --> 00:11:41,097
I know what I sign up for.

116
00:11:41,629 --> 00:11:43,575
He died because of what he believed in.

117
00:11:43,575 --> 00:11:45,010
Then what?

118
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:48,273
50 years later, there are still racists.

119
00:11:48,273 --> 00:11:50,331
It’s Thailand we talking about here.

120
00:11:50,331 --> 00:11:52,665
Our society and nation are different than his.

121
00:11:53,069 --> 00:11:57,520
If you want to change anything, you must have enough power.

122
00:12:03,096 --> 00:12:05,096
Power is corrupting.

123
00:12:05,096 --> 00:12:07,712
Ideas are what have the power to transform society.

124
00:12:50,535 --> 00:12:52,535
When was the last time you visited here?

125
00:12:53,691 --> 00:12:56,713
When I found out you're nasty just like Tawi.

126
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:01,159
You’re just the same.

127
00:13:01,621 --> 00:13:03,459
You’re so attached to your own thoughts.

128
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,776
Your brother and your friends have done well.

129
00:13:06,776 --> 00:13:08,500
Soon Tawi will be out of the picture

130
00:13:08,891 --> 00:13:11,284
and all the power will be in my hands.

131
00:13:12,701 --> 00:13:14,701
If Tawi can fail,

132
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:17,487
so can anybody else.

133
00:13:17,487 --> 00:13:19,503
You won't be able to keep the power for long.

134
00:13:20,172 --> 00:13:21,675
I know that.

135
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:24,014
Power is constantly transferred to someone else.

136
00:13:24,014 --> 00:13:28,224
If it's not with my family, it's with someone else's.

137
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,822
But now it's my chance,

138
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:31,541
and I'm not going to fail like he does.

139
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:33,319
You’ll never be better than him.

140
00:13:33,319 --> 00:13:36,432
With the power, you’ll become someone different.

141
00:13:37,348 --> 00:13:40,115
It’s normal to be that way.

142
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:44,262
Our nation is now distorted and disoriented.

143
00:13:44,262 --> 00:13:46,484
Without someone on horseback controlling over the power,

144
00:13:46,484 --> 00:13:48,171
it might even get worse.

145
00:13:48,171 --> 00:13:49,659
You want to be the power holder.

146
00:13:49,978 --> 00:13:51,340
That’s why you said that.

147
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,919
I can’t possibly control everything.

148
00:13:53,344 --> 00:13:57,513
Everyone has the freedom and the right to do anything of their own free will,

149
00:13:57,513 --> 00:13:59,234
except for a few things.

150
00:13:59,701 --> 00:14:03,455
If you don’t take it personally, it won’t be a problem for you.

151
00:14:04,508 --> 00:14:08,263
What we should do is find common ground to live together in peace.

152
00:14:08,957 --> 00:14:10,617
It’s always been like this

153
00:14:10,617 --> 00:14:12,491
and it will keep on going like this forever.

154
00:14:17,364 --> 00:14:19,364
Just accept the truth

155
00:14:20,334 --> 00:14:22,334
and open up to what I said.

156
00:14:31,768 --> 00:14:33,768
What’s happening to you?

157
00:14:44,455 --> 00:14:46,455
Are you okay?

158
00:14:47,073 --> 00:14:48,350
I am.

159
00:15:24,731 --> 00:15:26,731
Hang in there.

160
00:15:28,518 --> 00:15:30,518
I’ll take it off for you.

161
00:15:46,627 --> 00:15:48,627
Be careful here.

162
00:15:55,879 --> 00:15:57,326
What do we do now?

163
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:59,614
Tell me!

164
00:15:59,614 --> 00:16:01,423
Get the battery started to turn on the light.

165
00:16:09,149 --> 00:16:10,660
Bandage me.

166
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,076
Cut my t-shirt with scissors.

167
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:20,185
Take the jacket off first.

168
00:16:26,231 --> 00:16:27,657
Stay put.

169
00:16:46,494 --> 00:16:47,409
Hey!

170
00:16:47,792 --> 00:16:49,110
I don’t think I can do it.

171
00:16:49,429 --> 00:16:50,940
We should go to a hospital.

172
00:16:51,608 --> 00:16:52,906
We can’t.

173
00:16:52,906 --> 00:16:54,910
It’s a gunshot wound!

174
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:57,569
Because it is, we can’t go.

175
00:16:58,276 --> 00:17:02,148
If the police know what I’m doing, everyone will be screwed.

176
00:17:02,361 --> 00:17:03,947
What am I supposed to do then?

177
00:17:03,947 --> 00:17:05,336
Leave you like this?

178
00:17:05,549 --> 00:17:07,150
Do you want to die?

179
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:09,926
Calm down.

180
00:17:10,054 --> 00:17:11,900
Pour saline solution over it.

181
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:14,073
Wipe around the wound with alcohol.

182
00:17:22,753 --> 00:17:24,753
Saline solution over the wound.

183
00:17:53,189 --> 00:17:55,189
Then what?

184
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:57,687
Hurry up.

185
00:17:57,687 --> 00:17:59,687
Get the pliers.

186
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:02,646
Where are they?

187
00:18:04,456 --> 00:18:05,988
Wash them with alcohol.

188
00:18:05,988 --> 00:18:07,371
And wash your hands.

189
00:18:07,371 --> 00:18:08,560
Dry them.

190
00:18:12,961 --> 00:18:14,961
Get the bullet out with the pliers.

191
00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:16,053
Are you crazy?

192
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,531
I’m not a doctor.

193
00:18:18,296 --> 00:18:19,538
Hurry up.

194
00:18:19,538 --> 00:18:21,054
You can do it.

195
00:18:23,883 --> 00:18:25,883
Trust me.

196
00:18:56,678 --> 00:18:58,678
It’s out.

197
00:19:12,014 --> 00:19:13,418
You’re okay now.

198
00:19:19,621 --> 00:19:20,940
You left me.

199
00:19:21,089 --> 00:19:22,890
Why did you come back?

200
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:25,027
Isn’t what I’m doing clear enough to you?

201
00:19:25,282 --> 00:19:27,375
I want an explanation.

202
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,375


203
00:19:59,643 --> 00:20:03,870
I just knew what a near-death experience is.

204
00:20:05,009 --> 00:20:06,788
You’re a cop.

205
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:08,610
Haven’t you got shot before?

206
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,681
Or you’re the one that shoots at people?

207
00:20:20,522 --> 00:20:22,522
What’s bothering you?

208
00:20:27,034 --> 00:20:31,661
If I die, I don’t want to carry the guilt with me.

209
00:20:34,309 --> 00:20:37,204
Hey, listen to me.

210
00:20:43,139 --> 00:20:45,139
I won’t let you die.

211
00:20:49,763 --> 00:20:51,763
I want to say it

212
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:58,467
before I won’t get a chance to do so.

213
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:09,401
Remember the extrajudicial killing case that got me in trouble?

214
00:21:10,615 --> 00:21:11,641
I do.

215
00:21:14,271 --> 00:21:18,634
The truck driver that I shot to death

216
00:21:22,019 --> 00:21:24,019
was Sean’s father.

217
00:21:37,472 --> 00:21:39,472
Watch it!

218
00:21:40,584 --> 00:21:41,987
Who shot my father?

219
00:21:41,987 --> 00:21:43,397
Stop asking questions.

220
00:21:43,397 --> 00:21:44,580
I said I can’t tell you that.

221
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,501
You’re taking his side, right?

222
00:21:45,501 --> 00:21:46,692
You’re protecting him.

223
00:21:46,692 --> 00:21:47,685
Calm down.

224
00:21:47,685 --> 00:21:49,219
Who killed my dad?

225
00:21:49,219 --> 00:21:50,505
Tell me!

226
00:21:50,505 --> 00:21:51,788
Who killed him?

227
00:21:51,788 --> 00:21:53,108
Answer me.

228
00:21:53,108 --> 00:21:54,636
Say it.

229
00:21:54,636 --> 00:21:56,140
That’s enough.

230
00:21:57,313 --> 00:21:59,313
Calm down.

231
00:22:00,495 --> 00:22:03,540
Go cool yourself down downstairs.

232
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,760
After that,

233
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:24,224
I’ve always carried the guilt.

234
00:22:26,037 --> 00:22:28,932
It’s the motivation for me to get to this point.

235
00:22:33,398 --> 00:22:35,398
I want to unlock everything.

236
00:22:39,812 --> 00:22:41,812
I don’t want to carry anything anymore.

237
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:47,659
What are you going to do?

238
00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:49,763
Are you telling Sean what happened?

239
00:22:56,588 --> 00:22:58,588
You can’t.

240
00:22:59,185 --> 00:23:01,401
You can’t tell him.

241
00:23:06,152 --> 00:23:08,152
Sean’s dad was dead

242
00:23:10,617 --> 00:23:13,612
and Sean is about to get revenge on Tawi.

243
00:23:16,529 --> 00:23:20,096
Telling him now won’t make anything better.

244
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,750
But if I don’t tell him,

245
00:23:27,601 --> 00:23:30,322
I’ll regret it for the rest of my life.

246
00:23:30,322 --> 00:23:32,380
If you tell him now,

247
00:23:33,226 --> 00:23:37,219
he will lose it and wreck the plan we have.

248
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:39,564
But…

249
00:23:39,564 --> 00:23:43,730
Hey, if telling the truth doesn’t make anything better,

250
00:23:47,953 --> 00:23:49,953
you should just keep it to yourself.

251
00:23:55,982 --> 00:23:57,982
Plus,

252
00:23:59,831 --> 00:24:01,831
what you’re doing right now

253
00:24:03,547 --> 00:24:07,230
is like slowly fixing what you’ve done wrong.

254
00:24:08,856 --> 00:24:10,856
Just take it slow.

255
00:24:28,708 --> 00:24:29,663
Ouch!

256
00:24:29,663 --> 00:24:30,493
Sorry.

257
00:24:30,493 --> 00:24:32,493
Sit slowly.

258
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:58,690
Drink some water.

259
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:10,890
Take off your top. I’ll bandage you.

260
00:25:13,422 --> 00:25:15,422
Why are you doing this to me?

261
00:25:15,795 --> 00:25:17,871
To bandage you so you can get better.

262
00:25:17,871 --> 00:25:19,139
It’s only a graze wound.

263
00:25:19,139 --> 00:25:20,698
It doesn’t hurt much.

264
00:25:21,791 --> 00:25:23,791
Just do it.

265
00:25:56,323 --> 00:25:58,000
You left me.

266
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,539
Why did you come back?

267
00:26:04,015 --> 00:26:06,015
You’re confusing me.

268
00:26:06,289 --> 00:26:08,198
What do you want from me exactly?

269
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,738
Isn’t what I’m doing clear enough to you?

270
00:26:17,449 --> 00:26:19,449
I don’t understand.

271
00:26:19,449 --> 00:26:21,790
I thought you were the right one

272
00:26:22,601 --> 00:26:25,015
but now I feel like I don’t know you at all.

273
00:26:30,078 --> 00:26:32,078
Take some medicine.

274
00:26:33,233 --> 00:26:34,039
Please.

275
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:34,776
I won’t.

276
00:26:34,776 --> 00:26:35,753
Please, take it.

277
00:26:35,753 --> 00:26:37,620
I said no.

278
00:27:06,308 --> 00:27:08,308
Why are you being nice to me?

279
00:27:08,718 --> 00:27:10,718
Answer me!

280
00:27:10,718 --> 00:27:12,149
Why are you being nice to me?

281
00:27:12,149 --> 00:27:13,489
Just calm down.

282
00:27:14,434 --> 00:27:16,284
Get some rest in the tent.

283
00:27:21,879 --> 00:27:23,879
Slowly.

284
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:28,745
Rest comfortably.

285
00:27:28,968 --> 00:27:30,344
Stop it.

286
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:33,712
You’ve hurt me enough.

287
00:27:37,509 --> 00:27:39,509
I’m sorry.

288
00:27:39,509 --> 00:27:41,905
I don’t want an apology.

289
00:27:43,035 --> 00:27:45,284
I want an explanation.

290
00:27:49,478 --> 00:27:51,478
I can’t do that.

291
00:27:55,706 --> 00:27:57,706
Yeah, I must be crazy.

292
00:27:57,930 --> 00:28:00,258
How can I ask you for anything?

293
00:28:00,849 --> 00:28:03,192
You know what’s worse?

294
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:05,931
Whatever you say,

295
00:28:05,931 --> 00:28:07,740
I’m willing to do it for you

296
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,620
as long as you stay by my side.

297
00:28:29,069 --> 00:28:31,069
I’m right next to you now.

298
00:28:38,065 --> 00:28:40,065
That’s good enough for now.

299
00:29:24,869 --> 00:29:26,869
Sean.

300
00:29:33,481 --> 00:29:35,481
It’s okay.

301
00:29:36,594 --> 00:29:38,594
I’ll stay with you.

302
00:29:45,103 --> 00:29:47,103
Don’t you disappear on me again.

303
00:29:52,049 --> 00:29:54,049
I’m not going anywhere.

304
00:29:54,794 --> 00:29:56,794
I’ll be right here, next to you.

305
00:30:11,549 --> 00:30:13,549
Black.

306
00:30:15,216 --> 00:30:17,216
Black.

307
00:30:35,817 --> 00:30:37,817
Black.

308
00:30:44,333 --> 00:30:46,333
Black.

309
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,580
Black.

310
00:31:52,466 --> 00:31:54,292
Sean.

311
00:31:54,516 --> 00:31:56,403
What are you doing up there?

312
00:31:57,241 --> 00:31:59,241
How did you know I’m here?

313
00:31:59,321 --> 00:32:01,695
Black called asking me to pick you up.

314
00:32:01,695 --> 00:32:03,911
He doesn’t think you can ride the bike.

315
00:32:06,047 --> 00:32:08,058
Where is he now?

316
00:32:08,058 --> 00:32:09,488
He didn’t say.

317
00:32:09,732 --> 00:32:12,234
You go get your things and come with me.

318
00:32:33,583 --> 00:32:34,812
Sean,

319
00:32:35,185 --> 00:32:37,552
keep your feelings in check for now.

320
00:32:37,552 --> 00:32:39,804
We have so many things to deal with here.

321
00:33:28,052 --> 00:33:29,555
Who is this?

322
00:33:29,555 --> 00:33:30,706
My guy.

323
00:33:30,706 --> 00:33:31,667
He’s a cop.

324
00:33:31,667 --> 00:33:33,085
You got a cop involved.

325
00:33:33,085 --> 00:33:34,655
How can you even trust him?

326
00:33:35,376 --> 00:33:37,376
You’re not like the Black that I love.

327
00:33:37,376 --> 00:33:39,314
Go away. I want to be alone.

328
00:33:39,314 --> 00:33:41,314


329
00:34:03,554 --> 00:34:05,554
Are you alright?

330
00:34:06,008 --> 00:34:07,442
Whose car is this?

331
00:34:07,442 --> 00:34:08,914
My rides are all at the garage and we can’t go back now.

332
00:34:08,914 --> 00:34:10,130
It’s Dan’s.

333
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:11,319
Just get in.

334
00:34:30,929 --> 00:34:32,929
Are Yok and Gram safe?

335
00:34:33,481 --> 00:34:34,844
Where are they?

336
00:34:34,844 --> 00:34:36,156
I’m taking you to them.

337
00:35:15,965 --> 00:35:17,897
This building belongs to who?

338
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:19,588
It’s Dan’s painting studio.

339
00:35:19,588 --> 00:35:22,441
Yok recommended using it as our safe house.

340
00:35:37,018 --> 00:35:38,386
What’s that wound?

341
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:39,740
You got shot?

342
00:35:42,022 --> 00:35:44,022
Is it bad?

343
00:35:44,022 --> 00:35:45,134
Pretty bad.

344
00:35:45,134 --> 00:35:46,048
It’s right in my shoulder.

345
00:35:46,571 --> 00:35:48,656
Yok helped get the bullet out.

346
00:35:49,811 --> 00:35:51,799
Why are you out here?

347
00:35:51,799 --> 00:35:54,332
I told you to rest so you can get well soon.

348
00:35:57,148 --> 00:35:58,582
Come back inside.

349
00:35:58,822 --> 00:36:00,259
Where’s Gram?

350
00:36:00,629 --> 00:36:01,462
Went out to get food

351
00:36:01,462 --> 00:36:02,800
and some medicines for Dan.

352
00:36:02,909 --> 00:36:04,108
Yok,

353
00:36:04,108 --> 00:36:05,589
I’ll leave Sean with you here.

354
00:36:05,589 --> 00:36:06,771
I’ll go get Black.

355
00:36:06,771 --> 00:36:07,947
Come on in.

356
00:36:19,281 --> 00:36:21,005
How is your wound?

357
00:36:21,142 --> 00:36:23,142
Just a graze gunshot.

358
00:36:23,425 --> 00:36:24,780
Far from your heart.

359
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:26,658
Let me give you a tepid sponge.

360
00:36:42,192 --> 00:36:44,192
Why this place?

361
00:36:45,554 --> 00:36:47,554
It’s near my police station.

362
00:36:47,554 --> 00:36:48,845
Don’t worry.

363
00:36:48,845 --> 00:36:50,559
I know the man guarding this place.

364
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:53,457
I’ve been using this building as my studio for a couple of years now.

365
00:36:53,793 --> 00:36:55,602
No one ever noticed.

366
00:37:04,182 --> 00:37:05,786
Did you sleep here last night?

367
00:37:05,786 --> 00:37:07,651
Yes, to take care of him.

368
00:37:10,871 --> 00:37:12,653
You’re fast.

369
00:37:12,653 --> 00:37:14,418
You should learn from me.

370
00:37:17,252 --> 00:37:19,252
Okay.

371
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:25,176
Sean,

372
00:37:26,591 --> 00:37:28,792
you can even get up?

373
00:37:35,817 --> 00:37:37,817
And who is this?

374
00:37:45,692 --> 00:37:47,692
My guy

375
00:37:47,692 --> 00:37:48,998
and he’s a cop.

376
00:37:49,971 --> 00:37:51,187
His name is Dan.

377
00:37:51,187 --> 00:37:52,734
He’s helping us.

378
00:37:54,291 --> 00:37:55,333
A cop?

379
00:38:03,838 --> 00:38:05,838
Are you a cop?

380
00:38:09,278 --> 00:38:11,278
Are you out of your damn minds?

381
00:38:11,542 --> 00:38:13,171
You got a cop involved.

382
00:38:13,171 --> 00:38:14,863
How can you even trust him?

383
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:19,380
Stay out of it.

384
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,106
This is my plan.

385
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:24,366
I wasn’t asking you.

386
00:38:29,942 --> 00:38:31,942
Stop that attitude, Black.

387
00:38:31,942 --> 00:38:32,991
Attitude, my ass.

388
00:38:32,991 --> 00:38:34,152
You dragged the police into this.

389
00:38:34,152 --> 00:38:35,687
Now we’re all f*cked up.

390
00:38:35,687 --> 00:38:37,111
He saved me.

391
00:38:37,111 --> 00:38:38,449
Stop your madness.

392
00:38:39,182 --> 00:38:41,182
We will go down in flame because of you.

393
00:38:43,764 --> 00:38:44,914
Let’s just go.

394
00:38:44,914 --> 00:38:46,309
Don’t give a shit about him.

395
00:38:56,442 --> 00:38:58,442
Do you trust me?

396
00:39:22,104 --> 00:39:24,104
What shit are you playing now?

397
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,896
So you’re back, Black?

398
00:40:06,574 --> 00:40:07,659
Here.

399
00:40:08,916 --> 00:40:10,916
I have mine.

400
00:40:36,259 --> 00:40:38,259
I thought you quit.

401
00:40:41,586 --> 00:40:43,586
Why would I quit?

402
00:40:43,853 --> 00:40:45,853
You haven’t smoked lately.

403
00:40:49,473 --> 00:40:51,473
Go away. I want to be alone.

404
00:41:00,244 --> 00:41:02,244
You’re not like the Black that I love.

405
00:41:05,245 --> 00:41:07,245
What the hell are you saying?

406
00:41:09,319 --> 00:41:11,319
At first, I wondered

407
00:41:12,337 --> 00:41:14,337
why I didn’t hate you like I did before.

408
00:41:17,314 --> 00:41:19,314
What is wrong with you?

409
00:41:19,314 --> 00:41:20,922
Now I’m sure

410
00:41:21,638 --> 00:41:25,185
the one I’ve known lately isn’t you.

411
00:41:25,272 --> 00:41:27,042
But he’s someone better.

412
00:41:27,521 --> 00:41:29,033
What are you even bitching about?

413
00:41:59,381 --> 00:42:01,381
Do you tap out?

414
00:42:01,838 --> 00:42:02,849
No.

415
00:42:21,651 --> 00:42:23,019
You have a twin brother?

416
00:42:23,812 --> 00:42:25,279
Twin, my ass!

417
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:27,670
Where are you hiding the other one?

418
00:42:28,418 --> 00:42:30,069
What the hell are you talking about?

419
00:42:30,178 --> 00:42:31,663
Don’t lie to me.

420
00:42:31,663 --> 00:42:33,224
I know everything.

421
00:42:33,224 --> 00:42:34,375
Say it.

422
00:42:34,375 --> 00:42:35,479
Speak!

423
00:42:38,198 --> 00:42:40,198
Don’t you get close to my little brother again.

424
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:47,030
There’s no way you can stop me.

425
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:48,943
I won’t stay away from him.

426
00:43:01,142 --> 00:43:07,382
Directed by Anucha Boonyawatana

427
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,727
Can you not go back to see my friends again?

428
00:43:09,727 --> 00:43:11,310
Where are you hiding the other one?

429
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:12,363
Say it.

430
00:43:12,581 --> 00:43:14,076
You’re so selfish.

431
00:43:14,076 --> 00:43:16,502
Now that Black is back, you just decide to disappear?

432
00:43:16,502 --> 00:43:18,507
I don’t want to see your face again.

433
00:43:18,507 --> 00:43:20,563
I thought it’s for the best if you’re with Black.

434
00:43:20,563 --> 00:43:22,914
But I’ve seen you get hurt because of him so many times.

435
00:43:22,914 --> 00:43:24,820
Can I take care of you instead?

436
00:43:24,965 --> 00:43:27,419
I was the cop working on your father’s case.

437
00:43:27,419 --> 00:43:28,690
I missed a shot.

438
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:30,130
I shot your father.

439
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:32,936
A life for a life.
