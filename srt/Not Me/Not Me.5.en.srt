Characters, actions, occupations and events in this series are fictional and created for entertainment purposes only.

They are not intended to urge or promote any behavior in the series. Viewer discretion is advised.

3
00:00:17,899 --> 00:00:23,098
Impunity is a legal privilege to conduct wrong acts without being penalized.

4
00:00:23,098 --> 00:00:24,430
It’s tear gas. Watch out!

5
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:26,082
What the heck are you playing?

6
00:00:26,082 --> 00:00:27,091
I’m not playing.

7
00:00:27,091 --> 00:00:29,236
In a real situation, you will get shot if you act like a sitting duck.

8
00:00:29,236 --> 00:00:33,183
It’s the privilege that absolutely breaches rule of law principles.

9
00:00:33,183 --> 00:00:35,346
I found a girl.

10
00:00:35,346 --> 00:00:36,659
Black.

11
00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:38,270
You met her already?

12
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:39,707
Didn’t you miss me?

13
00:00:39,707 --> 00:00:40,554
I did.

14
00:00:40,554 --> 00:00:42,028
All the more reason to see her.

15
00:00:42,028 --> 00:00:44,327
Don’t you want to know who hurt Black?

16
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:20,708
(Of all Black’s friends, I think Gram is the last person who’d hurt Black.)

17
00:01:21,062 --> 00:01:28,886
(I don’t get why the one who cares about Black the most is secretly dating Eugene, Black’s girlfriend.)

18
00:01:32,374 --> 00:01:37,519
(What could be worse is that they might have betrayed Black together.)

19
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,066
What’s up?

20
00:02:07,066 --> 00:02:08,156
Hello.

21
00:02:08,156 --> 00:02:11,767
I think Gram might be the one that hurt Black.

22
00:02:11,767 --> 00:02:13,713
What did you find?

23
00:02:13,713 --> 00:02:15,324
(Eugene and Gram are meeting in secret.)

24
00:02:15,324 --> 00:02:17,507
I followed her and saw them hugging.

25
00:02:17,507 --> 00:02:21,729
(Maybe Gram injured Black because he wanted Eugene.)

26
00:02:21,729 --> 00:02:24,439
Come on. He’s in such a mess because of just one girl?

27
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:26,023
What a noob.

28
00:02:26,023 --> 00:02:29,183
I don’t know that for sure. That’s why I called.

29
00:02:32,136 --> 00:02:33,829
Did they hug very tight?

30
00:02:33,829 --> 00:02:35,291
Asshole, get serious.

31
00:02:35,891 --> 00:02:40,299
I'm not sure but there's a possibility.

32
00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:46,866
But as I said, when Gram saw me, he didn’t seem very surprised.

33
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:50,570
If he did hurt Black, he should have wondered

34
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,372
why Black was still fine.

35
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:54,236
Or he ambushed Black.

36
00:02:54,236 --> 00:02:57,347
Gram caught Black off guard.

37
00:02:57,347 --> 00:02:59,892
That’s why he’s sure Black wouldn’t know.

38
00:03:00,372 --> 00:03:02,031
That doesn’t make sense.

39
00:03:02,031 --> 00:03:04,076
(Right? I’m with you on that.)

40
00:03:04,076 --> 00:03:07,241
Black wouldn’t go down that easily.

41
00:03:07,241 --> 00:03:09,117
I think there’s more to the story.

42
00:03:11,112 --> 00:03:13,112
I'll keep a close watch on them.

43
00:03:13,112 --> 00:03:15,397
We might find something more.

44
00:05:06,182 --> 00:05:07,462
Black.

45
00:05:07,462 --> 00:05:08,980
You’re back?

46
00:05:26,467 --> 00:05:28,155
I should go now.

47
00:05:28,155 --> 00:05:29,212
What’s the hurry?

48
00:05:29,212 --> 00:05:31,525
Well, the room owner is back.

49
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,390
I’m taking you home.

50
00:05:48,616 --> 00:05:50,616
What the heck?

51
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,768
You don’t have to.

52
00:06:03,768 --> 00:06:04,988
I called a cab.

53
00:06:05,683 --> 00:06:06,987
Why?

54
00:06:06,987 --> 00:06:08,363
You should talk to Black.

55
00:06:08,363 --> 00:06:10,677
You two seem to have some kind of problem.

56
00:06:12,408 --> 00:06:13,808
What problem?

57
00:06:13,808 --> 00:06:15,046
I don’t know.

58
00:06:15,046 --> 00:06:18,668
Black looked pretty upset.

59
00:06:20,874 --> 00:06:22,274
Just ignore him.

60
00:06:22,274 --> 00:06:24,740
Since he decided to stay, he’s been acting like the room owner.

61
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,971
He doesn’t even work here.

62
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:32,644
It must be difficult to live with someone you dislike.

63
00:06:32,644 --> 00:06:35,928
I’m surprised Black can stay with you though.

64
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:41,946
He must be in some kind of trouble.

65
00:06:41,946 --> 00:06:43,946
That’s why Gumpa lets him stay.

66
00:06:44,562 --> 00:06:46,562
I’ll deal with him.

67
00:06:47,628 --> 00:06:48,764
Okay.

68
00:06:48,764 --> 00:06:50,764
My ride is here. I should get going.

69
00:06:50,764 --> 00:06:52,411
Get home safe.

70
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:57,348
If you have problems again, this is your getaway.

71
00:06:57,952 --> 00:07:01,125
I never want to get away. I just don’t want issues with my family.

72
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:03,758
They don’t get the art I’m doing.

73
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:09,819
I want them to know how precious art is.

74
00:07:10,481 --> 00:07:12,910
Art isn’t trash like they think it is.

75
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,083
Yes, ma’am. You’re the big artist.

76
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,227
Watch it.

77
00:07:18,227 --> 00:07:19,147
Bye.

78
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,399
Call me when you get home.

79
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:22,018
Okay.

80
00:07:35,565 --> 00:07:36,965
That was quick.

81
00:07:36,965 --> 00:07:39,715
I was seeing her off just out front.

82
00:07:41,219 --> 00:07:43,219
Namo said you had a problem with me.

83
00:07:45,062 --> 00:07:46,294
No.

84
00:07:46,294 --> 00:07:48,920
I don’t have any problem with you.

85
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,813
Whatever it is, just say it.

86
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:56,519
I don’t like it when people sleep in my spot.

87
00:07:58,175 --> 00:07:59,575
Your spot,

88
00:07:59,671 --> 00:08:01,305
but it’s my room.

89
00:08:01,305 --> 00:08:03,443
Can you just go somewhere else next time?

90
00:08:03,443 --> 00:08:05,198
I don't know if you left a stain on the bed.

91
00:08:05,198 --> 00:08:06,166
I did.

92
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:07,967
It’s everywhere.

93
00:08:07,967 --> 00:08:09,791
I did everything in your spot.

94
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:14,014
I would have peed on it as well if you had arrived later.

95
00:08:15,309 --> 00:08:17,309
I know you’re kind of a jerk.

96
00:08:17,309 --> 00:08:18,945
I just didn’t know you’re this horrible.

97
00:08:18,945 --> 00:08:21,139
Why being so territorial? It’s just a bed.

98
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:22,902
Sleeping spot is a personal space.

99
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:24,202
Is it so hard to get?

100
00:08:24,202 --> 00:08:27,308
Oh, I get it well because it used to be mine,

101
00:08:27,308 --> 00:08:28,739
until you took it.

102
00:08:28,739 --> 00:08:31,440
You just put your stuff all over it.

103
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,980
It’s my room anyway.

104
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,118
But right now,

105
00:08:34,118 --> 00:08:35,592
that spot is mine.

106
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,912
Your spot?

107
00:08:37,912 --> 00:08:39,785
Are you that possessive?

108
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:40,848
Yes.

109
00:08:40,848 --> 00:08:42,284
My spot.

110
00:08:42,284 --> 00:08:43,917
My stuff.

111
00:08:44,015 --> 00:08:46,015
Your stuff, huh?

112
00:08:46,015 --> 00:08:47,306
Then sleep on it.

113
00:08:47,306 --> 00:08:49,204
Use it all you want.

114
00:08:49,204 --> 00:08:50,513
What the heck are you doing?

115
00:08:51,827 --> 00:08:53,083
Get some sleep.

116
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:55,369
Sleep as long as you want.

117
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:56,157
Let me go.

118
00:08:57,923 --> 00:09:00,451
What do you freaking want from me?

119
00:09:41,891 --> 00:09:45,908
They don’t benefit from it at all.

120
00:09:45,908 --> 00:09:47,856
They don’t benefit from it at all.

121
00:09:47,856 --> 00:09:52,964
(Leaving what I saw this morning aside, Gram should be the most reliable one for me.)

122
00:09:53,578 --> 00:09:58,213
(Gram enlightens many things, not just about my brother.)

123
00:09:58,213 --> 00:10:01,760
(But about laws and injustices in Thai society.)

124
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,064
You’re late.

125
00:10:04,221 --> 00:10:05,933
I slept in.

126
00:10:05,933 --> 00:10:07,228
Wanna eat something?

127
00:10:09,461 --> 00:10:11,461
What are you two discussing?

128
00:10:11,461 --> 00:10:13,313
Antitrust Law against monopolies.

129
00:10:14,555 --> 00:10:16,555
Ah! The latest quiz we took.

130
00:10:16,555 --> 00:10:19,912
I got top marks and Gram asked me what I wrote.

131
00:10:19,912 --> 00:10:23,019
After I told him, he hasn’t stopped arguing.

132
00:10:23,019 --> 00:10:24,837
But I don’t get it.

133
00:10:24,837 --> 00:10:27,641
Antitrust Law isn’t really practical.

134
00:10:27,641 --> 00:10:30,357
Have you ever heard of a large corporation getting sued at all?

135
00:10:30,357 --> 00:10:32,065
Gram, I get you.

136
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:35,176
But the law is in place to ensure product quality.

137
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:38,124
If small businesses produce and fail to meet quality standards,

138
00:10:38,124 --> 00:10:40,966
the burden will be on the consumers.

139
00:10:40,966 --> 00:10:41,830
Why is it hard to understand?

140
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:42,786
You’re right, Nuch.

141
00:10:42,786 --> 00:10:45,243
But only a few big names are given the production reins.

142
00:10:45,243 --> 00:10:47,065
Tawi owns lots of products.

143
00:10:47,065 --> 00:10:50,422
What happens after small businesses launch their goods?

144
00:10:50,422 --> 00:10:52,557
He plagiarizes them, and the tiny companies perish.

145
00:10:52,557 --> 00:10:55,659
Small enterprises should be subsidized by the government as well.

146
00:10:55,659 --> 00:10:59,412
If Tawi really does that, then there’s the Copyright Law.

147
00:10:59,412 --> 00:11:02,217
You could have mentioned this topic.

148
00:11:02,945 --> 00:11:04,852
I’m not talking to you.

149
00:11:04,852 --> 00:11:07,273
What about you? How much did you get?

150
00:11:07,764 --> 00:11:09,764
I haven’t checked my score yet.

151
00:11:09,764 --> 00:11:11,154
What was your answer like?

152
00:11:11,154 --> 00:11:13,920
Like mine or Nuch’s?

153
00:11:14,699 --> 00:11:17,129
I mentioned capitalism.

154
00:11:17,129 --> 00:11:19,859
The more capital you have, the higher your chances of expanding your business.

155
00:11:19,859 --> 00:11:21,004
Damn it, Black!

156
00:11:21,004 --> 00:11:22,724
How did you write that?

157
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:24,561
Are you on their side now?

158
00:11:25,053 --> 00:11:27,448
I was just stating a fact.

159
00:11:27,448 --> 00:11:29,988
Hey, consumers aren’t stupid.

160
00:11:29,988 --> 00:11:32,854
They buy high-quality items and reject low-quality ones.

161
00:11:32,854 --> 00:11:34,727
They can think for themselves on this.

162
00:11:37,306 --> 00:11:39,306
See?

163
00:11:41,979 --> 00:11:43,979
[Eugene]

164
00:11:48,327 --> 00:11:49,819
I should get going.

165
00:11:49,819 --> 00:11:52,035
I’ve been fighting Gram all day.

166
00:11:52,198 --> 00:11:54,198
We have an exam. Don’t forget.

167
00:12:07,303 --> 00:12:13,360
(After I met Eugene, Gram seems to be concealing something.)

168
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,562
(Perhaps they're starting to have doubts about me.)

169
00:12:16,562 --> 00:12:21,836
(If I keep an eye on him closely, the truth might eventually come out.)

170
00:12:21,836 --> 00:12:24,668
Hey, can you help me study?

171
00:12:25,364 --> 00:12:27,239
Of course.

172
00:12:27,935 --> 00:12:29,935
Let’s do it at your place.

173
00:12:29,935 --> 00:12:31,639
It’s distracting here and at the garage.

174
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:34,278
Just let me know when.

175
00:12:34,278 --> 00:12:35,552
This evening.

176
00:12:35,552 --> 00:12:36,994
We can’t.

177
00:12:36,994 --> 00:12:38,653
We have chase tag.

178
00:12:38,653 --> 00:12:40,282
You can’t bail.

179
00:12:41,345 --> 00:12:42,543
Yeah?

180
00:12:42,543 --> 00:12:43,985
Did you forget?

181
00:12:45,061 --> 00:12:47,496
After the chase tag, I’ll help you study, okay?

182
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:50,299
(What the hell is chase tag?)

183
00:12:57,353 --> 00:12:58,325
Are we ready?

184
00:12:58,325 --> 00:13:00,506
It’s not like when we burned his house.

185
00:13:00,506 --> 00:13:02,304
His business unit is full of his employees.

186
00:13:02,304 --> 00:13:05,064
So I asked Gumpa to train us exclusively.

187
00:13:05,928 --> 00:13:07,928
Prepare to jump.

188
00:13:07,928 --> 00:13:09,928


189
00:13:44,422 --> 00:13:46,422
You two, hurry up.

190
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:49,744
Warm it up and we’ll head out.

191
00:13:55,138 --> 00:13:56,494
Do the warmup.

192
00:13:56,494 --> 00:13:58,278
It’s not like when we burned his house.

193
00:13:58,278 --> 00:14:00,587
His business unit is full of his employees.

194
00:14:00,587 --> 00:14:03,491
More importantly, Tawi’s wingman is there too.

195
00:14:03,491 --> 00:14:05,951
So I asked Gumpa to train us exclusively.

196
00:14:05,951 --> 00:14:07,879
Catch up once you’re done warming up.

197
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:34,988
Gram.

198
00:14:35,221 --> 00:14:38,659
Is Sean attacking Tawi’s manufacturer?

199
00:14:39,088 --> 00:14:41,220
Yes, it’s his plan.

200
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,851
You let him do it, remember?

201
00:14:43,376 --> 00:14:44,819
What is the plan?

202
00:14:44,819 --> 00:14:45,613
No idea.

203
00:14:45,613 --> 00:14:47,352
He will let us know later, I guess.

204
00:14:47,352 --> 00:14:48,976
Just do what he said for now.

205
00:14:52,723 --> 00:14:54,294
Ask Gram to help you stretch.

206
00:14:54,294 --> 00:14:55,355
Gram, can you help?

207
00:15:01,913 --> 00:15:02,883
Lower.

208
00:15:04,192 --> 00:15:05,211
A bit more.

209
00:15:05,831 --> 00:15:07,122
I’ll help stretch your back.

210
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:23,136
What was that scream for?

211
00:15:23,136 --> 00:15:23,751
It was nothing.

212
00:15:23,751 --> 00:15:24,805
Well, it hurts!

213
00:15:24,805 --> 00:15:25,725
Yes?

214
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:26,652
Let’s go again then.

215
00:15:26,652 --> 00:15:28,046
Come on.

216
00:15:36,109 --> 00:15:37,186
Guys.

217
00:15:37,242 --> 00:15:38,604
Refresh yourselves.

218
00:15:41,753 --> 00:15:42,873
Gram.

219
00:16:03,418 --> 00:16:04,624
Are we ready now?

220
00:16:05,934 --> 00:16:07,269
Follow me.

221
00:16:07,662 --> 00:16:09,662
Let’s do it.

222
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,600
Faster!

223
00:16:34,733 --> 00:16:36,068
Come on.

224
00:16:36,304 --> 00:16:37,958
Jump!

225
00:16:43,473 --> 00:16:44,553
Jump.

226
00:16:44,553 --> 00:16:45,824
Good job!

227
00:16:45,824 --> 00:16:47,273
Go, go!

228
00:16:56,367 --> 00:16:58,367
Black, come on.

229
00:16:58,669 --> 00:17:00,197
Are you running or crawling?

230
00:17:01,568 --> 00:17:03,568
Faster, Black.

231
00:17:05,431 --> 00:17:07,431
Move!

232
00:17:15,431 --> 00:17:17,431
Go, go!

233
00:17:34,337 --> 00:17:36,337
Prepare to jump.

234
00:18:15,271 --> 00:18:16,606
Do it!

235
00:18:38,505 --> 00:18:40,505
Are you scared?

236
00:18:41,343 --> 00:18:43,043
It’s just the height.

237
00:18:43,043 --> 00:18:44,813
That’s what makes you scared.

238
00:18:44,813 --> 00:18:46,357
I just don’t get it.

239
00:18:46,357 --> 00:18:48,150
Why do we need to jump across buildings?

240
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:49,678
How does it help?

241
00:18:49,678 --> 00:18:51,440
We’re just sneaking into a manufacturer, aren’t we?

242
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,710
We don’t need this skill.

243
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:56,273
What you see is a physical skill.

244
00:18:56,595 --> 00:18:58,732
But what I’m really teaching you is the mindset.

245
00:18:58,732 --> 00:19:01,443
You must focus on the destination and believe you can do it.

246
00:19:01,443 --> 00:19:03,279
Don’t think about the height.

247
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:05,313
Then there will be no chance of failure.

248
00:19:05,925 --> 00:19:07,849
Whatever doubts you’re having,

249
00:19:07,849 --> 00:19:09,847
any kind of fear you’re feeling, get rid of them.

250
00:19:09,847 --> 00:19:13,911
You just need to think about how you’re going to get from A to B.

251
00:19:14,598 --> 00:19:16,226
Let’s try again.

252
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:28,672
We all have just one life.

253
00:19:28,991 --> 00:19:29,998
YOLO!

254
00:19:44,613 --> 00:19:46,613
‘You only live once.’

255
00:19:49,705 --> 00:19:55,031
(Bravery and fear, I think these two things are the complete opposite.)

256
00:19:55,031 --> 00:19:57,649
(However, they can’t remain apart.)

257
00:20:19,914 --> 00:20:23,566
(We can’t be brave without fear.)

258
00:20:23,566 --> 00:20:32,610
(But being brave with no fear is like an explosive with no target.)

259
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:35,162
(The look from someone who’s overcome his fear surprisingly warms my heart.)

260
00:20:35,162 --> 00:20:42,118
(In that moment, I realize if he’s the bravery, I must be the fear.)

261
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:46,826
(So that what we hope to achieve can be accomplished.)

262
00:20:53,304 --> 00:20:55,304
Get off me.

263
00:20:59,287 --> 00:21:00,386
Gram!

264
00:21:04,856 --> 00:21:07,135
Black, get some rest with them.

265
00:21:07,775 --> 00:21:09,775
It’s okay. I’ll just sit here.

266
00:21:10,733 --> 00:21:12,733
Gumpa, we’ve exercised our legs.

267
00:21:12,733 --> 00:21:14,110
How about we go for the arms now?

268
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:15,618
Look at your friends.

269
00:21:15,751 --> 00:21:17,400
Can’t you go on?

270
00:21:18,697 --> 00:21:20,697
If you want to, go ahead.

271
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:22,730
I’ll go take a shower.

272
00:21:24,435 --> 00:21:26,092
I need to study.

273
00:21:26,092 --> 00:21:27,413
Gram is helping me.

274
00:21:28,035 --> 00:21:31,048
Right. And my legs are so worn out here.

275
00:21:32,555 --> 00:21:34,233
You guys are losers.

276
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:36,443
You’re the only one who wants to continue.

277
00:21:36,443 --> 00:21:37,900
You’re out of your mind.

278
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,364
Let’s go. I don’t want to fail the exam.

279
00:21:42,836 --> 00:21:44,836
See you.

280
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:46,478
Help me up.

281
00:21:49,626 --> 00:21:51,025
Where’s the exit. Gumpa?

282
00:21:51,218 --> 00:21:52,805
That way.

283
00:21:57,373 --> 00:22:02,055
(I’m guessing Sean’s plan is the same as today’s training.)

284
00:22:03,476 --> 00:22:08,800
(It must be full of determination as well as the risk of failure.)

285
00:22:09,972 --> 00:22:13,302
(I trust him to be the leader this time.)

286
00:22:13,642 --> 00:22:17,795
(I hope that one day he will listen to me and trust me as well.)

287
00:22:22,526 --> 00:22:24,891
Gumpa, Black is acting really weird.

288
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:31,397
Whenever we’re out training, he’d show off, act cool, and brag he’s the one who did it first.

289
00:22:31,397 --> 00:22:33,603
But he’s worried about his exam now.

290
00:22:33,603 --> 00:22:35,174
This is not like him at all.

291
00:22:35,174 --> 00:22:38,286
If you’re saying he’s weird, then you are too.

292
00:22:38,286 --> 00:22:39,291
How?

293
00:22:39,754 --> 00:22:42,394
You’ve been taking extra interest in him.

294
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:43,807
You’re wrong.

295
00:22:44,516 --> 00:22:46,605
I’m interested in our mission.

296
00:22:46,605 --> 00:22:48,688
I just don’t want him to screw up my plan.

297
00:22:50,163 --> 00:22:52,163
I’m with Sean on this.

298
00:22:52,163 --> 00:22:54,347
Black seems to have changed.

299
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:56,145
See?

300
00:22:56,145 --> 00:22:57,758
It’s not just me.

301
00:22:57,758 --> 00:22:59,538
Gram even said it too.

302
00:22:59,538 --> 00:23:01,702
Maybe it’s really a change.

303
00:23:01,702 --> 00:23:03,084
You and Black have changed too.

304
00:23:03,084 --> 00:23:05,492
From rivals to roommates.

305
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,967
You made us stay together.

306
00:23:07,967 --> 00:23:09,213
That’s not it.

307
00:23:09,213 --> 00:23:13,414
If you feel like something is changing and it isn’t you, then it must be Black.

308
00:23:13,414 --> 00:23:16,744
Can you tell how he’s changed?

309
00:23:34,835 --> 00:23:36,835
We’re attacking the manufacturer soon.

310
00:23:36,835 --> 00:23:38,599
Why hasn’t Sean revealed his plan yet?

311
00:23:38,599 --> 00:23:40,399
He will tell us when it’s time.

312
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:44,654
If his plan doesn’t work, we will all be screwed.

313
00:23:44,654 --> 00:23:46,654


314
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:19,410
Sean went nuts today.

315
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:21,227
He made us train so damn hard.

316
00:24:21,227 --> 00:24:22,816
It’s exhausting.

317
00:24:24,675 --> 00:24:26,325
What is his plan?

318
00:24:26,325 --> 00:24:28,454
Did he tell you any details?

319
00:24:30,248 --> 00:24:32,248
I’m as clueless as you are.

320
00:24:32,953 --> 00:24:34,312
Can you grab me a t-shirt?

321
00:24:34,312 --> 00:24:35,323
From where?

322
00:24:41,643 --> 00:24:44,958
Black, can we study tomorrow?

323
00:24:44,958 --> 00:24:46,534
I’m so drained.

324
00:24:47,123 --> 00:24:49,234
You can crash here tonight.

325
00:24:49,234 --> 00:24:50,047
We can’t.

326
00:24:50,047 --> 00:24:52,869
We must study tonight. I’m here after all.

327
00:24:54,911 --> 00:24:56,911
What topic should I tutor you on?

328
00:24:56,911 --> 00:25:01,165
Gram, we’re attacking the manufacturer soon.

329
00:25:01,453 --> 00:25:03,877
Why hasn’t Sean revealed his plan yet?

330
00:25:08,678 --> 00:25:12,518
Are you here to study for the exam or to study Sean?

331
00:25:14,303 --> 00:25:15,992
What if his plan doesn’t work?

332
00:25:15,992 --> 00:25:17,695
We will all be screwed.

333
00:25:17,695 --> 00:25:19,478
He will tell us when it’s time.

334
00:25:20,337 --> 00:25:22,337
Let’s study for now.

335
00:25:28,339 --> 00:25:30,339
Let me check the exam topics from Nuch.

336
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:36,518
Black, everything will be on the exam.

337
00:25:36,988 --> 00:25:40,234
Let’s study Monopoly.

338
00:25:40,234 --> 00:25:43,065
We’re attacking Tawi’s business unit because of this, right?

339
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,560
Let me take Tawi case as an example.

340
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,210
It’s the most obvious one.

341
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:51,960
From the upstream to the downstream of production, Tawi owns it all.

342
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:55,494
He's been buying up all of his competitors' businesses for the past few years.

343
00:25:55,494 --> 00:25:57,771
I don’t see how the law applies to him at all.

344
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,980
Are you even listening to me?

345
00:26:04,052 --> 00:26:05,449
I am, and I am considering what you said.

346
00:26:07,765 --> 00:26:13,615
Businessmen overseas are accused of being the same.

347
00:26:13,615 --> 00:26:14,806
This is not new.

348
00:26:14,806 --> 00:26:16,355
Not new?

349
00:26:16,511 --> 00:26:19,392
You’re here to bug me or to study exactly?

350
00:26:19,392 --> 00:26:22,283
I’m not bugging you. I just want to get it.

351
00:26:22,283 --> 00:26:23,313
Let’s do this.

352
00:26:23,313 --> 00:26:28,531
Explain everything to me, every aspect and point of discussion you wish to share with people.

353
00:26:28,531 --> 00:26:32,083
Make them understand why we're going after Tawi's company.

354
00:26:32,083 --> 00:26:34,083
What we’re doing that for?

355
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:40,702
First of all, you must know Antitrust Law isn't practical here.

356
00:26:40,702 --> 00:26:42,985
It’s something that won’t happen in other countries.

357
00:26:42,985 --> 00:26:47,336
If we give one company complete control over the market, it can do anything.

358
00:26:47,336 --> 00:26:50,669
People are forced to buy overpriced goods because they have no other option.

359
00:26:50,669 --> 00:26:53,440
Consumers buy from this company because it has no competition.

360
00:26:53,926 --> 00:26:55,737
Do you get it now?

361
00:26:55,737 --> 00:26:59,073
Produce your own products then. Who is stopping you?

362
00:27:01,318 --> 00:27:03,065
I can't.

363
00:27:03,065 --> 00:27:04,722
The law isn't in our favor.

364
00:27:04,722 --> 00:27:06,048
You can’t jump to that conclusion.

365
00:27:06,048 --> 00:27:07,636
It’s up to people’s discretion.

366
00:27:07,636 --> 00:27:09,188
Our nation is capitalist.

367
00:27:09,188 --> 00:27:13,385
And the law is also exercised to control product quality.

368
00:27:16,425 --> 00:27:18,425
It's an arrangement between them,

369
00:27:18,425 --> 00:27:20,545
the businessmen and those who make laws.

370
00:27:20,545 --> 00:27:21,738
Why don’t you get it?

371
00:27:23,307 --> 00:27:25,307
Calm down.

372
00:27:25,307 --> 00:27:30,565
If Tawi follows the law, then his actions are not wrong from a legal point of view.

373
00:27:30,987 --> 00:27:33,671
But when it comes to morality and justice,

374
00:27:33,671 --> 00:27:36,679
we need to demonstrate it and let society decide.

375
00:27:37,853 --> 00:27:39,522
How about this,

376
00:27:39,522 --> 00:27:41,203
you read whatever you want for now.

377
00:27:41,203 --> 00:27:43,202
I’ll go get you something to eat.

378
00:27:43,202 --> 00:27:45,709
Food might help you understand me better.

379
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:54,398
I'm sorry for thinking of you as more than just a friend.

380
00:28:56,539 --> 00:28:58,539
These are the dolls in Black’s room.

381
00:29:01,756 --> 00:29:02,920
B.

382
00:29:08,283 --> 00:29:09,638
B is Black.

383
00:29:10,225 --> 00:29:11,700
G is Gram.

384
00:29:12,663 --> 00:29:14,663
Then what did I just see this morning?

385
00:29:40,152 --> 00:29:42,256
So? Did you find UNAR?

386
00:29:43,084 --> 00:29:45,084
I can’t say I did.

387
00:29:45,084 --> 00:29:46,688
I went to the right place that day though.

388
00:29:46,688 --> 00:29:47,937
His painting was still new.

389
00:29:47,937 --> 00:29:50,186
Why do you want to meet him so bad?

390
00:29:50,882 --> 00:29:52,882
I like his work.

391
00:29:52,882 --> 00:29:54,489
I want to know who he is.

392
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,093
You’re his fan, Namo.

393
00:29:57,093 --> 00:30:00,885
Can you guess what he’s drawing next and where?

394
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:08,584
I think UNAR focuses on topics in public’s attention.

395
00:30:08,584 --> 00:30:11,576
Right now, he probably targets Tawi,

396
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:15,834
who is buying all businesses to have the whole market in his palm.

397
00:30:16,409 --> 00:30:18,040
It might be that.

398
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:21,176
Is there any company that closed itself down because of Tawi?

399
00:30:21,176 --> 00:30:24,158
Someplace deserted and no one is around.

400
00:30:24,515 --> 00:30:26,736
Don’t waste your time on him.

401
00:30:26,736 --> 00:30:29,883
You’re not the first one to look for UNAR.

402
00:30:30,116 --> 00:30:33,116
Many have tried and they all gave up.

403
00:30:33,756 --> 00:30:35,521
I’m not like them.

404
00:30:35,521 --> 00:30:37,590
I won’t stop until I found him.

405
00:30:39,252 --> 00:30:41,984
I will go find more information and I’ll try to guess his next move.

406
00:30:41,984 --> 00:30:43,231
Thanks a lot.

407
00:30:43,231 --> 00:30:44,469
Of course.

408
00:30:44,469 --> 00:30:46,604
Good luck finding him.

409
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:00,752
What are you doing?

410
00:31:00,752 --> 00:31:02,389
Looking for a paper to write on.

411
00:31:03,417 --> 00:31:06,312
What are you getting me?

412
00:31:08,195 --> 00:31:09,539
Rasmalai.

413
00:31:09,539 --> 00:31:11,284
Something that boosts your brain.

414
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,305
You like to eat something sweet when you're tired because sweetness activates your brain.

415
00:31:15,305 --> 00:31:17,891
Maybe you’ll get what I said better.

416
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,838
Here.

417
00:31:20,285 --> 00:31:21,781
Thank you but

418
00:31:22,596 --> 00:31:24,110
I have to go.

419
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:25,378
Don’t go yet.

420
00:31:25,378 --> 00:31:27,991
I brought this for you. Finish it first.

421
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:33,980
Here.

422
00:31:35,579 --> 00:31:36,529
Thanks.

423
00:31:36,529 --> 00:31:37,828
I should get going.

424
00:31:37,828 --> 00:31:38,969
Hold on.

425
00:31:39,533 --> 00:31:40,769
I’ll take you.

426
00:31:40,769 --> 00:31:42,641
It’s okay. I can take care of myself.

427
00:32:07,562 --> 00:32:10,282
Sean, I have to talk to you.

428
00:32:12,806 --> 00:32:14,009
About Black.

429
00:32:19,175 --> 00:32:23,314
I’m not sure if Gram is someone who hurt Black

430
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:25,999
or actually loves Black.

431
00:32:27,535 --> 00:32:29,535
What do you mean?

432
00:32:29,535 --> 00:32:31,535


433
00:33:14,568 --> 00:33:17,266
The cops on this case finally caught the bad guys.

434
00:33:18,031 --> 00:33:21,845
But they claimed it was just an altercation.

435
00:33:21,965 --> 00:33:23,730
What are your thoughts, White?

436
00:33:24,364 --> 00:33:26,364
I don’t think that’s all.

437
00:33:26,364 --> 00:33:28,285
I’m with you.

438
00:33:28,404 --> 00:33:30,553
I think it’s Tawi.

439
00:33:30,553 --> 00:33:34,829
I’ll have my lawyer talk to the police and see what else we can do.

440
00:33:36,502 --> 00:33:39,766
Have you talked to my mom? She might be able to help.

441
00:33:39,766 --> 00:33:41,278
I reached out.

442
00:33:41,278 --> 00:33:44,385
She said she would leave it to the authorities.

443
00:33:44,385 --> 00:33:46,233
She wants no involvement.

444
00:33:48,472 --> 00:33:50,472
Todd.

445
00:33:50,731 --> 00:33:52,731
Should I go see her?

446
00:33:55,556 --> 00:33:59,067
You can but I don’t think that will help.

447
00:33:59,545 --> 00:34:01,775
The fight between Black and her was huge.

448
00:34:01,775 --> 00:34:04,832
It was so bad they decided to cut each other off.

449
00:34:04,832 --> 00:34:08,939
You know that Black got involved in an unlawful business.

450
00:34:08,939 --> 00:34:11,670
And your mother is a judge.

451
00:34:12,673 --> 00:34:15,031
They’re on different sides.

452
00:34:15,757 --> 00:34:19,373
When you said you wanted to quit, what did those guys say?

453
00:34:19,373 --> 00:34:23,575
They didn’t want me to quit as Black seems to be the group leader.

454
00:34:25,751 --> 00:34:27,751
Do they want to keep going?

455
00:34:27,751 --> 00:34:28,871
They won’t stop.

456
00:34:28,871 --> 00:34:32,396
Even without me, they will definitely follow their ideology.

457
00:34:32,396 --> 00:34:34,621
Sean should step in and take the lead.

458
00:34:35,393 --> 00:34:39,447
Do you know what their next move is?

459
00:34:39,447 --> 00:34:40,837
Is it about Tawi?

460
00:34:40,837 --> 00:34:43,945
I have no idea about the plan. I’m trying to find out.

461
00:34:43,945 --> 00:34:45,452
No way.

462
00:34:45,452 --> 00:34:49,199
If you’re to do something, you must learn all about the plan.

463
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:51,239
Otherwise, it’s too risky.

464
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:52,290
I know.

465
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:55,382
But I don’t want to risk it or put people in trouble like the last time.

466
00:34:55,382 --> 00:34:56,307
So?

467
00:34:56,307 --> 00:34:58,358
Are you going to stop them?

468
00:34:58,358 --> 00:35:00,058
Be careful.

469
00:35:00,058 --> 00:35:01,933
You might get caught.

470
00:35:03,551 --> 00:35:04,930
I’m fine.

471
00:35:05,361 --> 00:35:09,067
I’m sure no one knows I’m not Black.

472
00:35:09,991 --> 00:35:11,117
You know why?

473
00:35:11,738 --> 00:35:12,959
Why?

474
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:16,208
Because no one knows Black has a twin brother.

475
00:35:16,208 --> 00:35:20,047
They think I went through something and I’m in some kind of shock.

476
00:35:20,047 --> 00:35:22,131
Why are you so sure?

477
00:35:25,441 --> 00:35:30,747
When I was in Russia, I never told anyone about my twin.

478
00:35:32,087 --> 00:35:34,087
I even kept it hidden from my ex-girlfriend.

479
00:35:35,496 --> 00:35:38,117
I didn’t want to think of anything painful.

480
00:35:39,447 --> 00:35:41,447
I'm sure Black felt the same way.

481
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:50,871
Then when anyone mentions anything about twins, just run.

482
00:35:52,327 --> 00:35:54,327
Let’s go see Black.

483
00:36:13,264 --> 00:36:15,264
What’s his condition?

484
00:36:17,247 --> 00:36:19,247
The nurse said he’s stable now.

485
00:36:20,116 --> 00:36:22,257
He doesn’t need a ventilator anymore.

486
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,710
But…

487
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:27,278
they can’t tell when he’s going to wake up.

488
00:36:51,605 --> 00:36:53,605
Do you remember when I told you

489
00:36:55,205 --> 00:36:57,540
Gram and Eugene might be in a relationship?

490
00:36:57,891 --> 00:37:01,200
That might have been his motive to hurt Black.

491
00:37:01,975 --> 00:37:03,975
Now I’m not so sure.

492
00:37:04,462 --> 00:37:06,462
About what?

493
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:09,310
I’m not sure if Gram is someone who hurt Black

494
00:37:10,181 --> 00:37:12,181
or actually loves Black.

495
00:37:13,157 --> 00:37:15,157
What do you mean?

496
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:20,944
I found a card with their figures on it, like the ones in Black’s room.

497
00:37:20,944 --> 00:37:23,088
It’s a love card.

498
00:37:23,547 --> 00:37:27,506
I think Gram didn’t give it to Black as he’s afraid to lose a friend.

499
00:37:28,545 --> 00:37:31,347
I might be getting it wrong.

500
00:37:38,303 --> 00:37:40,303
We don’t know that.

501
00:37:41,139 --> 00:37:44,740
Black might seem like a bad guy on the outside.

502
00:37:45,813 --> 00:37:47,813
But he’s actually a good guy.

503
00:37:49,695 --> 00:37:52,627
I’m not surprised if his friend likes him.

504
00:38:53,341 --> 00:38:55,341
Gotcha.

505
00:39:30,316 --> 00:39:31,551
Cops!

506
00:39:31,677 --> 00:39:33,677
Freeze!

507
00:39:34,835 --> 00:39:36,835
Don’t run!

508
00:39:36,835 --> 00:39:37,941
Stop!

509
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:50,787
Follow them.

510
00:40:10,938 --> 00:40:13,703
They’re following you because of what you paint?

511
00:40:16,196 --> 00:40:18,196
Since the day you burned the house,

512
00:40:18,507 --> 00:40:20,993
they’ve been following my Instagram.

513
00:40:21,074 --> 00:40:22,700
They think I’m the one who did it.

514
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,337
So yes, they’re following me.

515
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,089
Congratulations.

516
00:40:30,336 --> 00:40:32,336
Why are you following me?

517
00:40:34,297 --> 00:40:36,297
I wanted to know who you are.

518
00:40:38,163 --> 00:40:39,446
UNAR.

519
00:40:39,446 --> 00:40:41,120
Your real name.

520
00:40:42,683 --> 00:40:44,683
Why do you want to know?

521
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:50,010
I just want to know.

522
00:41:14,867 --> 00:41:16,867
Damn, he’s fast.

523
00:41:19,674 --> 00:41:21,674
Sorry though.

524
00:41:21,674 --> 00:41:23,121
I’m faster this time.

525
00:41:29,466 --> 00:41:31,466

526
00:41:32,777 --> 00:41:34,777
Shit! He’s a cop.

527
00:42:03,059 --> 00:42:05,059
Black.

528
00:42:05,658 --> 00:42:07,658
Gram.

529
00:42:12,034 --> 00:42:14,034
[Sean]

530
00:42:18,151 --> 00:42:19,458
What?

531
00:42:19,458 --> 00:42:21,215
(What a blunt answer.)

532
00:42:21,215 --> 00:42:22,976
Just say whatever you want.

533
00:42:22,976 --> 00:42:25,205
(Why aren’t you sleeping at the garage?)

534
00:42:25,205 --> 00:42:27,282
(Since you’re so territorial.)

535
00:42:27,282 --> 00:42:29,446
I’ll sleep wherever I want.

536
00:42:29,446 --> 00:42:31,400
If that’s all you want to say, I’ll hang up.

537
00:42:31,612 --> 00:42:34,284
(Shit! Ouch!)

538
00:42:34,519 --> 00:42:37,310
Sean.

539
00:43:00,676 --> 00:43:02,676
Sean.

540
00:43:04,181 --> 00:43:05,823
Sean.

541
00:43:11,058 --> 00:43:13,058
Sean.

542
00:43:41,888 --> 00:43:43,888
What! Let me go.

543
00:43:44,846 --> 00:43:46,846
Let go.

00:44:08,795 --> 00:44:10,795
What’s your plan?

546
00:44:10,795 --> 00:44:12,960
We will sneak into his beverage manufacturer

547
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,336
and put a contaminant to the products.

548
00:44:14,336 --> 00:44:16,847
What? Isn’t it dangerous?

549
00:44:16,847 --> 00:44:18,835
Are you going to let them carry on their immoral shit?

550
00:44:18,835 --> 00:44:20,559
The society is now careless about what they do.

551
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:22,889
Yok, do you think his plan will work?

552
00:44:22,889 --> 00:44:23,919
I do.

553
00:44:23,919 --> 00:44:25,506
We should have the backup plan.

554
00:44:26,929 --> 00:44:28,929
Lock this place down.

555
00:44:28,929 --> 00:44:32,952
Don’t let anyone in or out, including those who switch shifts.
