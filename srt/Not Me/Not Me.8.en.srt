3
00:00:18,213 --> 00:00:21,700
I looked for you because I wanted to understand you better.

4
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,624
You painted me.

5
00:00:23,624 --> 00:00:25,433
It’s my turn to draw you.

6
00:00:25,433 --> 00:00:26,983
I kissed Gram.

7
00:00:27,087 --> 00:00:30,039
I honestly have no idea what I should do now.

8
00:00:31,258 --> 00:00:33,258
Citizens!

9
00:00:33,258 --> 00:00:37,647
Let’s witness the marriage equality fashion show!

10
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,453
Tawi, get out.

11
00:00:41,758 --> 00:00:43,705
Marriage equality.

12
00:00:43,705 --> 00:00:44,718
I want to talk to you.

13
00:00:44,718 --> 00:00:45,678
About what?

14
00:00:45,678 --> 00:00:47,629
You know what it’s about.

15
00:00:51,433 --> 00:00:52,831
Why do you want to get in?

16
00:00:53,894 --> 00:00:55,417
It’s my room.

17
00:00:57,688 --> 00:00:59,688
Don’t sit on my bed!

18
00:00:59,688 --> 00:01:00,678
Why not?

19
00:01:00,678 --> 00:01:02,977
You’ve been wearing these pants and sitting everywhere.

20
00:01:02,977 --> 00:01:04,666
I don’t want to wash my bedsheet now.

21
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:05,569
So?

22
00:01:05,901 --> 00:01:07,278
Do I need to take them off?

23
00:01:07,278 --> 00:01:08,538
Just sit on the floor.

24
00:01:10,227 --> 00:01:12,227
Sit down.

25
00:01:17,548 --> 00:01:18,759
And you told me to sit on the floor.

26
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:20,186
Well, it’s my room.

27
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,900
So why are you here?

28
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,830
Are you here to apologize?

29
00:01:37,585 --> 00:01:39,585
If you don’t want to drink, give it back.

30
00:01:45,908 --> 00:01:47,078
Black!

31
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:55,697
What do you want to talk to me about?

32
00:03:12,296 --> 00:03:14,296
I was being too hot-headed that day.

33
00:03:15,991 --> 00:03:19,486
So today I’m treating you to a drink in return.

34
00:03:21,081 --> 00:03:21,940
See?

35
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,880
You’re here to apologize.

36
00:03:26,656 --> 00:03:28,656
You’ve changed so much.

37
00:03:31,298 --> 00:03:34,087
You use your brain more. You smile more.

38
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:36,915
Ever since we started it,

39
00:03:36,915 --> 00:03:39,919
this is the first time we've had this much support from people.

40
00:03:40,924 --> 00:03:41,845
Right?

41
00:03:41,845 --> 00:03:43,186
Did you watch the news?

42
00:03:43,186 --> 00:03:46,493
The protesters pitch their tents in front of Tawi's company and spend the night there.

43
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:48,040
There are more and more people joining,

44
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,683
particularly after work hours.

45
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,013
I did.

46
00:03:51,013 --> 00:03:53,191
Everywhere Tawi goes, people curse after him.

47
00:03:53,563 --> 00:03:56,956
Now, the momentum is with us.

48
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,370
What did Tawi do to you?

49
00:04:31,622 --> 00:04:34,992
You might think this is your problem,

50
00:04:35,885 --> 00:04:37,624
not someone else’s.

51
00:04:39,271 --> 00:04:41,271
But you don’t need to keep it to yourself.

52
00:04:43,474 --> 00:04:45,474
You might feel better

53
00:04:46,329 --> 00:04:48,329
if you share it.

54
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,784
If it’s too much to handle,

55
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:53,157
I’m here to listen.

56
00:05:03,986 --> 00:05:08,165
My dad used to work for Tawi, trafficking his drugs.

57
00:05:11,431 --> 00:05:14,116
I was shocked just like you are when I found out.

58
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:20,807
I'd always thought of him as a decent man, a hero.

59
00:05:24,262 --> 00:05:26,480
I remember this so well.

60
00:05:28,233 --> 00:05:30,233
I was reading a book

61
00:05:31,105 --> 00:05:33,105
when the police knocked on our door.

62
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:37,627
My mom was utterly taken aback

63
00:05:37,627 --> 00:05:39,994
when they said my dad was a drug trafficker.

64
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,440
He was resisting arrest

65
00:05:45,476 --> 00:05:47,476
and got extrajudicially killed.

66
00:05:59,212 --> 00:06:01,212
I was mad he was a drug dealer.

67
00:06:01,714 --> 00:06:04,037
I was mad he betrayed my mom and me.

68
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:07,050
I was mad he dared to teach me to be honest,

69
00:06:07,809 --> 00:06:09,809
to do good things, and to comply with the laws.

70
00:06:10,426 --> 00:06:12,454
Then rage turned into hatred.

71
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:15,833
What he did had followed me everywhere.

72
00:06:17,632 --> 00:06:19,632
Everyone in school hated me.

73
00:06:20,531 --> 00:06:22,531
My friends turned into strangers.

74
00:06:24,408 --> 00:06:25,848
And finally,

75
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
my mom got sick and left me alone.

76
00:06:43,842 --> 00:06:48,270
Back then, I thought it was too late to find the answer

77
00:06:49,184 --> 00:06:51,463
or redeem what my dad did.

78
00:06:51,463 --> 00:06:53,315
The only one with the truth,

79
00:06:53,615 --> 00:06:58,957
with enough power and money to vanish this case so easily was Tawi.

80
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:03,030
Everyone knows he’s a drug lord

81
00:07:03,582 --> 00:07:06,420
as well as a legal businessman on the surface.

82
00:07:07,866 --> 00:07:12,315
I thought someone like me was nothing compared to him.

83
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:15,066
My life was over.

84
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,685
I didn’t have the reason to live on.

85
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,439
But you got past it.

86
00:07:28,555 --> 00:07:30,555
That’s why you’re here.

87
00:07:34,213 --> 00:07:36,213
I was lucky I met you.

88
00:07:36,829 --> 00:07:38,829
Your plan gave me a life goal.

89
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,584
It gave me the way to fight against Tawi.

90
00:07:48,838 --> 00:07:52,166
I’m glad you told me about this.

91
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,833
It helps me understand

92
00:07:57,469 --> 00:07:59,469
and get to know you better.

93
00:08:00,901 --> 00:08:02,901
Why do you want to know about me?

94
00:08:04,195 --> 00:08:06,195
Because I want you to trust me

95
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,445
just like I trust you.

96
00:08:11,489 --> 00:08:13,157
Do you trust me?

97
00:08:13,863 --> 00:08:16,195
Did you just say that to make me feel good?

98
00:08:20,739 --> 00:08:22,739
What are you doing?

99
00:08:24,851 --> 00:08:26,270
Damn it!

100
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:30,709
What the hell are you doing?

101
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:32,535
A trust fall.

102
00:08:32,535 --> 00:08:33,853
Haven't done it?

103
00:08:34,164 --> 00:08:35,417
No.

104
00:08:35,534 --> 00:08:37,041
What are you talking about?

105
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:38,753
It’s trust.

106
00:08:39,588 --> 00:08:41,464
I just showed you I trust you.

107
00:08:41,464 --> 00:08:43,016
So I did the free fall.

108
00:08:43,016 --> 00:08:44,742
And you just showed me

109
00:08:44,742 --> 00:08:46,669
you wouldn’t let me go.

110
00:08:49,517 --> 00:08:51,517
You are full of surprises.

111
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,440
Does it still hurt I punched you?

112
00:08:56,198 --> 00:08:57,658
Are you saying I can punch you back?

113
00:08:57,658 --> 00:08:58,857
Do it.

114
00:09:06,006 --> 00:09:06,885
Ouch!

115
00:09:09,806 --> 00:09:11,080
It hurts.

116
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,131
Didn’t think the one who does would be hurt too.

117
00:09:14,077 --> 00:09:15,475
We’re even now.

118
00:09:15,475 --> 00:09:16,141
Yes.

119
00:09:17,935 --> 00:09:21,388
(The way Sean looks at me has slowly changed.)

120
00:09:21,388 --> 00:09:23,030
(It’s not as aggressive as before.)

121
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:23,751
Does it turn red?

122
00:09:23,751 --> 00:09:27,188
(The wall he built is gradually breaking.)

123
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:35,242
(The secret he told is like a door I can walk through to get closer to him.)

124
00:09:41,089 --> 00:09:42,529
Fake sleeping?

125
00:09:42,577 --> 00:09:44,194
Am I making the right decision here?

126
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:45,396
You are.

127
00:09:45,521 --> 00:09:47,303
What do I have to do?

128
00:09:49,457 --> 00:09:51,040
Can you take off your clothes?

129
00:11:08,429 --> 00:11:10,429
Fake sleeping?

130
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:12,259
You really are sleeping.

131
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:15,767
You’re so inebriated.

132
00:12:17,109 --> 00:12:19,109
That’s good.

133
00:12:32,069 --> 00:12:34,069
What do I need to do?

134
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,079
Wait here for a second.

135
00:12:53,528 --> 00:12:55,528
Get down here.

136
00:13:06,967 --> 00:13:08,220
Am I making the right decision here?

137
00:13:08,572 --> 00:13:09,793
You are.

138
00:13:09,964 --> 00:13:11,927
You will be in my final project.

139
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:15,740
You should be happy.

140
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:18,048
What do I have to do here?

141
00:13:23,611 --> 00:13:25,611
Can you take off your clothes?

142
00:13:26,057 --> 00:13:28,557
What? Do I really have to?

143
00:13:31,026 --> 00:13:36,151
My project communicates through a nude picture of a victim of injustice in our society.

144
00:13:36,151 --> 00:13:37,698
I’m not even kidding.

145
00:13:38,214 --> 00:13:40,042
I need to turn this work in.

146
00:13:40,042 --> 00:13:45,145
I’m using a nude picture to show an oppressed person’s pain and physical marks.

147
00:13:45,145 --> 00:13:51,786
And I’m questioning why beauty is defined differently when we’re all humans just the same.

148
00:13:54,988 --> 00:13:56,548
Are you serious?

149
00:13:56,548 --> 00:13:57,763
I am.

150
00:13:57,763 --> 00:13:59,112
Take them off.

151
00:13:59,112 --> 00:14:00,587
Don’t be so tense.

152
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:03,925
I haven’t done anything like this.

153
00:14:04,229 --> 00:14:06,037
Relax your body.

154
00:14:06,037 --> 00:14:08,154
Free your mind.

155
00:14:21,289 --> 00:14:23,289
That’s it.

156
00:14:35,644 --> 00:14:37,182
Pants too.

157
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:39,482
My pants too?

158
00:14:39,482 --> 00:14:41,218
Of course. It’s a nude.

159
00:14:41,218 --> 00:14:42,373
Don’t think too much.

160
00:14:42,373 --> 00:14:44,738
My intention is nothing more than just drawing.

161
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:19,638
Hey.

162
00:15:20,536 --> 00:15:21,722
It’s art.

163
00:15:21,722 --> 00:15:23,522
Do not worry about it.

164
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:25,168
If you don’t put away that pillow,

165
00:15:25,168 --> 00:15:27,655
I'll assume you're thinking about something other than art.

166
00:15:34,147 --> 00:15:36,147
Are you?

167
00:15:41,819 --> 00:15:42,938
That’s it.

168
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:44,201
Just relax.

169
00:15:48,784 --> 00:15:50,784
How do I even relax?

170
00:16:14,837 --> 00:16:16,837
You don’t go out in a field very often, right?

171
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,270
You’re being so shy.

172
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,148
Is it so difficult to be a super disciplined cop?

173
00:16:25,148 --> 00:16:26,152
No.

174
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:29,583
Being a cop has always been my dream since I was a kid.

175
00:16:29,691 --> 00:16:33,494
Is your dream as beautiful today as it was then?

176
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:51,125
Hey! Hold that pose.

177
00:16:51,584 --> 00:16:53,242
And hold that feeling.

178
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:56,319
Can you straighten your right leg a bit?

179
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,988
Hands together.

180
00:17:01,091 --> 00:17:03,091
Hold that, please.

181
00:17:44,462 --> 00:17:45,740
What’s wrong?

182
00:17:47,075 --> 00:17:49,075
I just feel like

183
00:17:50,452 --> 00:17:53,575
I’m confessing my sins.

184
00:17:55,297 --> 00:17:57,297
I did something wrong before.

185
00:18:00,565 --> 00:18:02,565
But I can’t go back and fix it again.

186
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,084
I tried to reclaim justice

187
00:18:09,215 --> 00:18:11,215
but I failed.

188
00:18:13,388 --> 00:18:16,577
In the end, I could do nothing.

189
00:18:30,788 --> 00:18:32,128
It’s done.

190
00:18:32,128 --> 00:18:33,455
Do you want to see it?

191
00:18:44,944 --> 00:18:46,130
I like it.

192
00:18:47,383 --> 00:18:50,499
This is not the final, just the sketch.

193
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:53,040
I need to redraw and color it.

194
00:18:53,263 --> 00:18:55,442
Just wait to see the final version.

195
00:19:06,402 --> 00:19:08,402
It’s okay.

196
00:19:11,027 --> 00:19:13,027
It’s in the past.

197
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,750
You did great.

198
00:19:39,699 --> 00:19:41,699
You’ll be fine.

199
00:20:49,058 --> 00:20:54,272
I never thought some people would have malicious intent towards me.

200
00:20:54,272 --> 00:20:56,157
Stop talking like you’re a saint.

201
00:20:56,157 --> 00:20:58,157


202
00:21:27,525 --> 00:21:29,525
Shit! What the hell?

203
00:21:29,525 --> 00:21:30,556
Sean!

204
00:21:30,939 --> 00:21:32,113
Sean!

205
00:21:33,087 --> 00:21:35,087
Hungover?

206
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:37,859
Did you tie me up?

207
00:21:37,859 --> 00:21:39,710
It’s just you and me here.

208
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:41,248
Who else could have tied you?

209
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:43,632
Why did you do it?

210
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,204
Think.

211
00:21:47,204 --> 00:21:48,900
Why am I doing this?

212
00:21:50,221 --> 00:21:51,094
What the heck are you playing?

213
00:21:51,094 --> 00:21:52,146
Let me go.

214
00:21:52,146 --> 00:21:52,849
Untie me.

215
00:21:52,849 --> 00:21:53,734
Fine.

216
00:21:54,055 --> 00:21:56,055
I’ll release you.

217
00:21:58,015 --> 00:22:01,209
Why would I tie you up at all if I’m gonna release you that easily?

218
00:22:04,561 --> 00:22:05,660
Untie me.

219
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,268
You, release me!

220
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:11,170
Ouch! Are you a dog?

221
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:12,831
I’ll bite until you untie me.

222
00:22:13,579 --> 00:22:15,512
Let me go.

223
00:22:16,888 --> 00:22:18,528
You’re very good at biting.

224
00:22:18,528 --> 00:22:20,642
How about you bite those ropes and release yourself?

225
00:22:20,642 --> 00:22:21,856
Sean!

226
00:22:21,856 --> 00:22:23,471
Come back!

227
00:22:23,471 --> 00:22:24,461
Sean!

228
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,411
Sean, you asshole.

229
00:22:26,756 --> 00:22:28,441
Let me go.

230
00:22:28,441 --> 00:22:30,155
Sean, you dickhead!

231
00:23:04,934 --> 00:23:06,281
You, bastard!

232
00:23:09,879 --> 00:23:11,383
Oh! It’s you?

233
00:23:11,383 --> 00:23:12,417
Yes.

234
00:23:12,417 --> 00:23:13,474
It’s me.

235
00:23:14,299 --> 00:23:16,299
What the hell are you playing?

236
00:23:16,655 --> 00:23:18,020
It’s Sean.

237
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,629
Can you untie me?

238
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,520
How did you get tied up like this?

239
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,133
I don’t know. I was asleep.

240
00:23:26,133 --> 00:23:27,912
What did you guys do last night?

241
00:23:29,473 --> 00:23:31,473
We drank and talked just a little.

242
00:23:31,473 --> 00:23:35,044
You don't tell me things these days. You’ve been gone.

243
00:23:35,044 --> 00:23:36,836
I have to come to your place.

244
00:23:36,836 --> 00:23:38,113
Because I don’t have anything to tell.

245
00:23:38,113 --> 00:23:39,491
What’s there to say?

246
00:23:41,017 --> 00:23:43,017
Do you have water? I’m thirsty.

247
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,390
I only brought soy milk.

248
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:46,739
Give me some.

249
00:23:54,367 --> 00:23:58,620
The news about Tawi’s manufacturer and a substance in his products,

250
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,118
those are all your doings?

251
00:24:02,672 --> 00:24:03,861
See?

252
00:24:03,861 --> 00:24:05,983
You didn’t tell me about it.

253
00:24:07,214 --> 00:24:08,628
I am sorry.

254
00:24:08,628 --> 00:24:11,247
Next time, I’ll report everything I do.

255
00:24:11,629 --> 00:24:12,931
Don’t sulk.

256
00:24:12,931 --> 00:24:14,428
I’m not sulking.

257
00:24:14,428 --> 00:24:16,042
I won’t try to reconcile then.

258
00:24:18,106 --> 00:24:19,114
Every damn time.

259
00:24:19,114 --> 00:24:20,618
I’ll get back at you.

260
00:24:27,567 --> 00:24:29,522
[Tawi is the guest of today’s lecture class.]

261
00:24:29,522 --> 00:24:32,383
[When are you coming? I need to talk to you.]

262
00:24:33,955 --> 00:24:34,750
Hey.

263
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,297
Where are you going?

264
00:24:36,297 --> 00:24:37,457
The university.

265
00:24:38,412 --> 00:24:40,412
I came here just to get ditched by you?

266
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:41,923
And all these things?

267
00:24:41,923 --> 00:24:44,003
I’ve brought a lot. Aren’t you gonna eat first?

268
00:24:44,438 --> 00:24:46,592
It’s all I need to fill my stomach.

269
00:24:51,617 --> 00:24:53,211
Lock the door for me.

270
00:24:53,211 --> 00:24:55,218
What am I, your servant?

271
00:25:17,985 --> 00:25:19,985
What?

272
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:24,510
I’m sorry about Eugene.

273
00:25:27,646 --> 00:25:30,502
You can hit or punch me all you want.

274
00:25:30,502 --> 00:25:32,501
I’m sorry. It’s my fault.

275
00:25:32,501 --> 00:25:34,881
I won’t hit you. I know you didn’t mean to.

276
00:25:36,982 --> 00:25:38,982
Can you forgive Eugene then?

277
00:25:40,791 --> 00:25:42,791
She loves you so much.

278
00:25:45,138 --> 00:25:47,138
I need to think about it.

279
00:25:48,587 --> 00:25:50,587
Black.

280
00:25:52,143 --> 00:25:54,594
I don’t want you to lose such a good person like her.

281
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:57,086
Why do you have to speak for her?

282
00:26:00,057 --> 00:26:02,057
I don't think I’ll ever see Eugene again.

283
00:26:07,286 --> 00:26:12,846
Hello, students from Law, Political Science, Economics, and many more.

284
00:26:12,846 --> 00:26:18,003
We will hear a lecture from the most successful businessman in the country.

285
00:26:18,003 --> 00:26:24,274
Please welcome Mr. Tawi Kuerkulsvasti, our former student here on stage.

286
00:26:29,078 --> 00:26:31,078
Thank you.

287
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:33,461
Wow!

288
00:26:35,852 --> 00:26:38,235
Hello everyone here, my juniors.

289
00:26:38,686 --> 00:26:42,463
I’m here speaking as a businessman.

290
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:45,305
I started off with the motto

291
00:26:45,305 --> 00:26:49,524
‘Turn problems into success by eliminating the problems.’

292
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:55,990
Sometimes, fixing them without managing them isn’t enough.

293
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:58,084
Please.

294
00:26:58,084 --> 00:27:01,532
Is your invaded manufacturer included in one of your problems?

295
00:27:01,532 --> 00:27:03,853
That’s why some of your employees got laid off?

296
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:07,037
What a brilliant question.

297
00:27:07,037 --> 00:27:09,717
Nobody wants it to happen.

298
00:27:09,717 --> 00:27:14,330
My company is affected badly by this scenario.

299
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:15,992
Our overall income is declining.

300
00:27:15,992 --> 00:27:20,501
I never thought some people would have malicious intent towards me

301
00:27:20,501 --> 00:27:22,083
and went this far.

302
00:27:22,083 --> 00:27:27,430
They’re the reason my employees, whom I regard as my family members, lost their jobs.

303
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:29,430
Stop talking like you’re a saint.

304
00:27:32,962 --> 00:27:34,286
What did you say?

305
00:27:34,286 --> 00:27:36,421
You claimed that you made up for them.

306
00:27:36,782 --> 00:27:40,109
But is that really enough to compensate for the life they're losing?

307
00:27:40,109 --> 00:27:43,378
What you do is starve them to death.

308
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:46,746
Student, please keep your manners.

309
00:27:47,197 --> 00:27:48,944
Sit down.

310
00:27:48,944 --> 00:27:51,150
That’s okay. I want to clear things out.

311
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:52,532
It’s fine.

312
00:27:53,309 --> 00:27:54,876
It’s good that you asked.

313
00:27:54,876 --> 00:27:57,152
I already said this in my previous interview.

314
00:27:57,152 --> 00:28:00,614
Employees can always come up to me if they are truly in need of help.

315
00:28:00,614 --> 00:28:02,908
I’m willing to assist. No problem at all.

316
00:28:02,908 --> 00:28:07,598
Anyway, it must be based on appropriateness and possibility.

317
00:28:07,598 --> 00:28:09,845
We can't possibly please everyone, can we?

318
00:28:10,724 --> 00:28:12,976
Otherwise, they'll keep asking indefinitely.

319
00:28:12,976 --> 00:28:17,342
But firing people shows that you do not value people's lives.

320
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:21,750
Sean, calm down.

321
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:23,887
Student, show some manners.

322
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:26,668
I’m sorry, Mr. Tawi.

323
00:28:26,668 --> 00:28:28,076
No hard feelings.

324
00:28:28,076 --> 00:28:30,584
Let’s have a 15-minute break.

325
00:28:31,439 --> 00:28:32,808
Come on.

326
00:28:32,808 --> 00:28:34,617
Sean, easy.

327
00:28:34,617 --> 00:28:35,972
Can you please excuse me?

328
00:28:44,216 --> 00:28:49,393
(The wrath inside Sean’s chest makes me immediately understand

329
00:28:49,393 --> 00:28:55,518
that the violence he shows is to conceal the weakness inside.)

330
00:28:55,908 --> 00:29:03,152
(I’m not mad he hurt me because I know what he's going through is more painful.)

331
00:29:32,875 --> 00:29:34,176
Student,

332
00:29:34,875 --> 00:29:36,435
are you okay?

333
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:39,470
Are you mad at me?

334
00:29:39,966 --> 00:29:42,930
I like you though. You were being so frank.

335
00:29:44,457 --> 00:29:46,457
I bet I asked a good question.

336
00:29:46,457 --> 00:29:48,132
That’s why it could get you mad.

337
00:29:49,823 --> 00:29:53,265
I was a little upset. Your question was harsh.

338
00:29:53,265 --> 00:29:56,327
But I admire you.

339
00:29:56,575 --> 00:29:57,870
Yeah?

340
00:29:58,388 --> 00:30:01,100
How about I ask you one more question?

341
00:30:01,244 --> 00:30:03,342
We’ll see if you still admire me.

342
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,220
Do you still remember this employee of yours?

343
00:30:17,032 --> 00:30:21,105
How could you say you loved your employees like your family members?

344
00:30:23,826 --> 00:30:25,826
I do.

345
00:30:27,696 --> 00:30:31,640
But I have nothing to say or prove about this because it’s not true.

346
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,183
Stop bullshitting!

347
00:30:33,183 --> 00:30:36,512
An ordinary man like him couldn’t be a drug lord

348
00:30:37,239 --> 00:30:39,291
if someone wasn’t behind him.

349
00:30:39,291 --> 00:30:41,183
I’m deeply sorry

350
00:30:41,882 --> 00:30:46,673
to learn that my former employee was involved in drug trafficking.

351
00:30:46,673 --> 00:30:48,649
But I have nothing to do with that.

352
00:30:48,649 --> 00:30:50,479
It’s good that we talk.

353
00:30:50,479 --> 00:30:51,470
Now it’s my turn to ask.

354
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:53,792
Why did you bring it up? What do you want?

355
00:30:53,792 --> 00:30:55,144
Do you want money?

356
00:30:55,392 --> 00:30:57,102
Or you just want to pick a fight?

357
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:05,441
Right now, it’s just you and me here.

358
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:08,365
The case is closed.

359
00:31:08,619 --> 00:31:10,508
It can't be fixed anymore.

360
00:31:11,815 --> 00:31:13,815
Just speak the truth.

361
00:31:15,581 --> 00:31:17,581
That dead man…

362
00:31:17,896 --> 00:31:19,896
was my father.

363
00:31:27,506 --> 00:31:29,506
Young man, I’m sorry.

364
00:31:30,358 --> 00:31:32,358
Here’s the truth.

365
00:31:35,109 --> 00:31:39,002
The truth is that you had a drug dealer as a father.

366
00:31:39,002 --> 00:31:40,450
That’s the truth.

367
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:43,854
Your dad sold drugs and I had nothing to do with him.

368
00:31:43,854 --> 00:31:45,499
Just say you’re behind it.

369
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,422
Say it!

370
00:31:47,692 --> 00:31:49,461
Just calm down!

371
00:31:57,404 --> 00:31:58,830
Student,

372
00:31:59,461 --> 00:32:01,352
this is just a friendly warning.

373
00:32:02,406 --> 00:32:05,262
Though you’re just a student, you can get sued.

374
00:32:05,735 --> 00:32:07,167
Got it?

375
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:10,044
Before you do anything,

376
00:32:10,472 --> 00:32:12,184
think it through.

377
00:32:22,579 --> 00:32:24,579
I’ve got you some leads.

378
00:32:24,579 --> 00:32:26,485
It’s a warehouse.

379
00:32:27,419 --> 00:32:28,991
Help me with the tent.

380
00:32:28,991 --> 00:32:31,343
Why didn't you ask Gram and Yok along?

381
00:32:31,343 --> 00:32:33,922
They're not very skilled at spying.

382
00:32:33,922 --> 00:32:35,594
Keep a close watch.

383
00:32:35,594 --> 00:32:37,490
Step away. It’s ticklish.

384
00:32:38,488 --> 00:32:40,127
Tell me

385
00:32:40,127 --> 00:32:41,913
what you’re seeing.

386
00:32:41,913 --> 00:32:43,913


387
00:33:21,715 --> 00:33:23,075
What’s up?

388
00:33:23,075 --> 00:33:24,728
Where have you been all night?

389
00:33:25,176 --> 00:33:27,034
At Black’s.

390
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:30,721
I thought they got your ass already.

391
00:33:30,721 --> 00:33:32,367
I was worried.

392
00:33:32,367 --> 00:33:34,816
Gumpa, I’m not an idiot.

393
00:33:35,831 --> 00:33:38,251
What is it you wanted to talk to me about?

394
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:42,030
I’ve got you some leads.

395
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:43,234
What lead?

396
00:33:43,234 --> 00:33:44,906
A warehouse.

397
00:33:44,906 --> 00:33:48,613
They hide the drugs in electric appliances and water heaters.

398
00:33:48,613 --> 00:33:50,944
This international company is just a shell corporation.

399
00:33:50,944 --> 00:33:53,243
Nobody knows Tawi is involved.

400
00:33:53,243 --> 00:33:55,533
This is his strategic point.

401
00:33:55,881 --> 00:33:58,405
If we can take down this warehouse,

402
00:33:58,405 --> 00:34:01,522
everyone involved in this might get exposed.

403
00:34:04,594 --> 00:34:05,698
Yeah.

404
00:34:06,725 --> 00:34:07,983
What’s the matter?

405
00:34:07,983 --> 00:34:09,962
You don’t seem to be interested.

406
00:34:09,962 --> 00:34:12,729
I’m interested and nothing is wrong.

407
00:34:12,729 --> 00:34:14,731
Something is wrong, Sean.

408
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,392
Look here.

409
00:34:47,725 --> 00:34:50,875
This is true craftsmanship.

410
00:34:50,875 --> 00:34:53,676
They poured concrete into a mold to build this.

411
00:34:54,208 --> 00:34:56,026
Feel it.

412
00:34:56,973 --> 00:35:00,084
Not something easy to come by these days.

413
00:35:02,918 --> 00:35:07,374
The designer wanted it to have a brutalist architecture style,

414
00:35:07,374 --> 00:35:12,601
to reveal the nature of the structure and concrete.

415
00:35:12,933 --> 00:35:17,347
I think it looks aggressive yet strong.

416
00:35:18,864 --> 00:35:20,199
Namo.

417
00:35:21,325 --> 00:35:23,117
You’re good.

418
00:35:23,117 --> 00:35:25,462
You could find an abandoned building near an industrial estate.

419
00:35:26,736 --> 00:35:31,208
People who work in this field know where a good place is.

420
00:35:31,208 --> 00:35:32,801
I’ve always wanted to come here.

421
00:35:33,441 --> 00:35:35,013
Why do you want to come anyways?

422
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:39,754
To use it as an observation tower.

423
00:35:39,946 --> 00:35:41,363
Observation?

424
00:35:41,593 --> 00:35:43,249
Observe what?

425
00:35:44,468 --> 00:35:46,468
I don’t know much.

426
00:35:46,468 --> 00:35:48,150
It’s Gumpa’s work.

427
00:35:50,088 --> 00:35:51,173
Good.

428
00:35:51,173 --> 00:35:53,509
You start it first and I’ll follow.

429
00:35:53,509 --> 00:35:56,186
I’ll bring all my friends to paint here.

430
00:35:56,186 --> 00:35:57,212
Go ahead.

431
00:35:57,383 --> 00:35:59,966
But just let me finish my business here first.

432
00:36:00,299 --> 00:36:02,299
Of course.

433
00:36:02,637 --> 00:36:04,133
I should get going.

434
00:36:04,133 --> 00:36:05,400
I’ll give you a lift.

435
00:36:05,573 --> 00:36:07,428
No need. I’ll find my way.

436
00:36:07,806 --> 00:36:09,269
Bye.

437
00:37:14,493 --> 00:37:16,493
Hello, there.

438
00:37:22,516 --> 00:37:23,646
You must have struggled so much.

439
00:37:23,646 --> 00:37:25,093
I can see the marks here.

440
00:37:25,413 --> 00:37:27,357
You caused them so shut up.

441
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:30,179
Give me that.

442
00:37:30,179 --> 00:37:32,447
Why did you ask me to bring so many things?

443
00:37:32,447 --> 00:37:34,353
Are you going camping or what?

444
00:37:34,353 --> 00:37:35,856
Stop nagging.

445
00:37:36,317 --> 00:37:39,338
You’ll thank me later for asking you to bring everything.

446
00:37:39,338 --> 00:37:43,104
We’re spying all night long and not going anywhere.

447
00:37:43,104 --> 00:37:44,116
Let’s go.

448
00:38:01,476 --> 00:38:03,476
We can’t enter from this door.

449
00:38:09,487 --> 00:38:10,822
Are you getting back at me?

450
00:38:10,822 --> 00:38:11,763
Nope.

451
00:38:20,728 --> 00:38:22,728
You will pay for that tonight.

452
00:38:28,565 --> 00:38:30,565
Nice staircase.

453
00:38:30,565 --> 00:38:31,956
How about we race to the third floor?

454
00:38:31,956 --> 00:38:33,221
Who gets there first is the winner.

455
00:38:33,221 --> 00:38:34,053
Sure.

456
00:38:34,053 --> 00:38:35,245
Hold on.

457
00:38:36,438 --> 00:38:37,645
Do not cheat.

458
00:38:37,645 --> 00:38:38,385
I’m carrying many things.

459
00:38:38,385 --> 00:38:39,536
Let me go first.

460
00:38:40,075 --> 00:38:42,075
Give me your backpack then.

461
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:45,154
Hey!

462
00:38:47,254 --> 00:38:48,696
Damn it!

463
00:38:57,463 --> 00:38:58,593
So?

464
00:38:58,593 --> 00:39:00,373
Panting like a dog, huh?

465
00:39:08,589 --> 00:39:09,719
Don’t.

466
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:11,813
Don’t do it.

467
00:39:13,762 --> 00:39:14,994
You’re a tease.

468
00:39:15,413 --> 00:39:16,823
Help me with the tent.

469
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:22,030
Why didn't you ask Gram and Yok along?

470
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,940
They're not very skilled at spying.

471
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,913
You’re the right one.

472
00:39:37,872 --> 00:39:39,872
Are we even doing it right?

473
00:39:39,872 --> 00:39:41,564
Shake and flick it to get the air inside.

474
00:40:30,139 --> 00:40:31,909
Seeing that warehouse?

475
00:40:31,909 --> 00:40:34,001
That’s where Tawi stores his drugs.

476
00:40:34,001 --> 00:40:36,453
The entrance and exit are out front.

477
00:40:37,106 --> 00:40:40,363
I think there’re 3-4 spots we can use to sneak in.

478
00:40:40,363 --> 00:40:42,872
But we don’t know their guarding schedule yet.

479
00:40:42,872 --> 00:40:44,959
I need you to keep an eye on that for me.

480
00:40:45,701 --> 00:40:48,527
Do you even think I’ll help you after what you did?

481
00:40:49,039 --> 00:40:50,886
Fine. Don’t help.

482
00:40:50,886 --> 00:40:52,435
I can do it by myself.

483
00:40:52,435 --> 00:40:54,435
Staying up all night won’t kill me.

484
00:40:55,413 --> 00:40:56,984
I know you’re good.

485
00:40:56,984 --> 00:40:58,473
You can do anything.

486
00:40:58,473 --> 00:40:59,209
Yes.

487
00:40:59,337 --> 00:41:00,330
I’m good.

488
00:41:04,936 --> 00:41:06,936
What if I want to help?

489
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:11,636
We’re in this together. It can’t be that bad.

490
00:41:14,886 --> 00:41:16,886
What are you doing?

491
00:41:20,969 --> 00:41:22,534
Keep a close watch.

492
00:41:22,534 --> 00:41:24,854
Step away. It’s ticklish.

493
00:41:27,085 --> 00:41:28,369
Tell me

494
00:41:28,702 --> 00:41:30,002
what you’re seeing.

495
00:41:30,309 --> 00:41:31,241
Not seeing anything.

496
00:41:31,241 --> 00:41:32,304
Get off me.

497
00:41:49,012 --> 00:41:51,012
What are you seeing?

498
00:41:51,012 --> 00:41:53,439
It looks just like a typical warehouse.

499
00:41:54,437 --> 00:41:56,304
Come with me then.

500
00:41:56,304 --> 00:41:57,357
To where?

501
00:41:57,357 --> 00:41:58,729
Just come.

502
00:42:24,838 --> 00:42:26,838
Very nice view, isn’t it?

503
00:42:36,744 --> 00:42:38,744
Hey!!

504
00:42:57,158 --> 00:42:59,158
What the hell are you playing?

505
00:42:59,158 --> 00:43:01,208
You could have died.

506
00:43:03,917 --> 00:43:05,917
The trust fall.

507
00:43:06,332 --> 00:43:08,463
Clearly, you saved me.

508
00:43:08,463 --> 00:43:10,327
You don’t let me go.

509
00:43:10,992 --> 00:43:14,140
I’ll save whoever does that.

510
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:16,411
Don’t be full of yourself.

511
00:43:16,619 --> 00:43:18,257
Oh yeah?

512
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:20,290
Am I full of myself?

513
00:43:21,897 --> 00:43:25,176
Yes, you’re full of yourself.

514
00:43:51,594 --> 00:43:53,594
Sean,

515
00:43:54,387 --> 00:43:56,801
have you ever thought about

516
00:43:57,526 --> 00:43:59,953
what we’d be doing,

517
00:44:01,537 --> 00:44:03,537
if we hadn’t done these things?

518
00:44:13,976 --> 00:44:17,818
This is the goal that keeps me alive,

519
00:44:27,688 --> 00:44:29,688
and you are too.

520

521
00:46:14,725 --> 00:46:15,702
Seriously,

522
00:46:15,702 --> 00:46:17,348
what’s going on between you and Black?

523
00:46:17,348 --> 00:46:19,142
You shouldn’t love someone like him.

524
00:46:19,394 --> 00:46:22,904
Tawi’s manufacturer, you did it, right?

525
00:46:23,375 --> 00:46:25,228
We’re being followed.

526
00:46:25,228 --> 00:46:28,882
He might act illegally just to deal with you guys.

527
00:46:34,437 --> 00:46:36,437
You have a sibling.
