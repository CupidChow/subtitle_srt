3
00:00:18,455 --> 00:00:20,455
That dead man was my father.

4
00:00:20,455 --> 00:00:22,302
Just say you’re behind it.

5
00:00:22,514 --> 00:00:23,986
Say it!

6
00:00:23,986 --> 00:00:25,969
Black, I don’t want you to lose such a good person like her.

7
00:00:25,969 --> 00:00:27,918
Why do you have to speak for her?

8
00:00:28,707 --> 00:00:31,262
Being a cop has always been my dream since I was a kid.

9
00:00:31,262 --> 00:00:33,621
Is your dream as beautiful today as it was then?

10
00:00:33,818 --> 00:00:35,799
I did something wrong before.

11
00:00:35,974 --> 00:00:37,027
Sean,

12
00:00:37,191 --> 00:00:41,574
what we’d be doing if we hadn’t done these things?

13
00:00:41,574 --> 00:00:45,405
This is the goal that keeps me alive,

14
00:00:45,405 --> 00:00:47,274
and you are too.

15
00:01:27,183 --> 00:01:29,183
Are you scared of me?

16
00:01:32,714 --> 00:01:33,859
No.

17
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:35,460
I’m not.

18
00:01:37,223 --> 00:01:38,237
So…

19
00:01:39,705 --> 00:01:41,903
what are we doing?

20
00:01:44,205 --> 00:01:46,205
Um…

21
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:49,819
What should I do to you?

22
00:01:52,171 --> 00:01:54,171
That’s up to you.

23
00:01:57,171 --> 00:01:59,171
Don’t be afraid.

24
00:01:59,805 --> 00:02:01,748
Once I did it,

25
00:02:02,491 --> 00:02:04,491
let me know if you like it or not.

26
00:02:23,871 --> 00:02:25,871
Do you like that?

27
00:02:28,946 --> 00:02:30,135
I do.

28
00:02:43,701 --> 00:02:45,197
And that?

29
00:03:19,787 --> 00:03:21,787
And do you like that?

30
00:04:15,196 --> 00:04:16,955
If I’m not Black,

31
00:04:18,185 --> 00:04:20,157
the Black you used to know,

32
00:04:21,159 --> 00:04:23,159
will you be okay with that?

33
00:04:32,823 --> 00:04:35,656
I’ve never known you better than this before.

34
00:05:00,752 --> 00:05:01,963
This,

35
00:05:02,433 --> 00:05:04,391
can I have it?

36
00:05:14,229 --> 00:05:20,306
(The confession I want him to know but is too afraid to make is right there on my body.)

37
00:05:21,532 --> 00:05:30,853
(Throwing away what’s covering it is like throwing away the guilt I feel towards him.)

38
00:06:04,932 --> 00:06:06,932
Is that the sound of your heart beating?

39
00:06:06,932 --> 00:06:09,469
Thump, thump, thump, thump.

40
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Not mine.

41
00:06:16,465 --> 00:06:17,676
It’s yours.

42
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,120
It’s yours.

43
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,494
Fine. It’s mine.

44
00:06:24,932 --> 00:06:26,406
Mine too.

45
00:08:25,909 --> 00:08:27,010
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

46
00:08:34,629 --> 00:08:35,533
I am.

47
00:08:36,554 --> 00:08:38,554
You?

48
00:08:40,358 --> 00:08:41,613
I’m okay.

49
00:08:42,678 --> 00:08:52,240
(All these times, I’ve always believed that the soul connection and the longing were exclusively for me and my brother.)

50
00:08:52,945 --> 00:08:59,820
(But now I know that particular feeling also happens for someone special to me.)

51
00:09:05,181 --> 00:09:06,567
Sean…

52
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:18,492
What’s bothering you?

53
00:09:19,498 --> 00:09:20,732
Nothing.

54
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,900
I’m here to report a crime, officer.

55
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,510
Hey, you.

56
00:10:08,729 --> 00:10:10,071
What are you doing here?

57
00:10:10,071 --> 00:10:12,467
I’m a citizen. Can’t I be in a police station?

58
00:10:14,734 --> 00:10:15,770
Go home.

59
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:16,935
You might get spotted.

60
00:10:16,935 --> 00:10:19,737
Officer, you’re a cop.

61
00:10:19,932 --> 00:10:21,932
You can’t shoo citizens away from the station.

62
00:10:22,535 --> 00:10:25,271
How did you find me?

63
00:10:26,045 --> 00:10:27,731
I’m smart.

64
00:10:29,009 --> 00:10:31,491
Why are you in a small station like this?

65
00:10:31,491 --> 00:10:33,649
Your score wasn’t good enough to choose your workplace first?

66
00:10:33,649 --> 00:10:34,565
You know too much.

67
00:10:34,565 --> 00:10:36,222
I was joking there.

68
00:10:36,222 --> 00:10:37,266
Did you really get a bad score?

69
00:10:37,266 --> 00:10:38,571
Are you here to bug me?

70
00:10:39,241 --> 00:10:40,299
No.

71
00:10:40,947 --> 00:10:42,947
I’m here to ask you out for dinner.

72
00:10:44,932 --> 00:10:46,559
Wanna come?

73
00:10:46,756 --> 00:10:48,149
When are you off-duty?

74
00:10:49,647 --> 00:10:51,647
This is your first piece of work.

75
00:10:51,647 --> 00:10:53,614
There must be an interesting story behind it.

76
00:10:53,614 --> 00:10:55,022
It’s a free day today.

77
00:10:55,022 --> 00:10:57,038
I want to take you to a place.

78
00:10:57,212 --> 00:10:58,755
Want to walk there with me?

79
00:10:58,755 --> 00:11:00,755


80
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,261
It’s good.

81
00:11:25,648 --> 00:11:27,123
Good, right?

82
00:11:27,989 --> 00:11:32,038
How did you know that cops with good scores get to choose their stations first?

83
00:11:32,038 --> 00:11:34,479
Outsiders aren’t supposed to know that.

84
00:11:36,525 --> 00:11:38,525
I might be an insider, actually.

85
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:43,334
Don’t lie to me.

86
00:11:43,334 --> 00:11:45,333
I did a background check on you.

87
00:11:45,742 --> 00:11:47,776
A background check?

88
00:11:47,776 --> 00:11:49,770
So you know everything about me.

89
00:11:50,447 --> 00:11:51,627
No.

90
00:11:51,809 --> 00:11:57,630
I only know you don't have a criminal record and you're not a bureau officer.

91
00:11:58,334 --> 00:12:02,623
You did a background check on me because you’re interested in

92
00:12:04,866 --> 00:12:06,160
I am.

93
00:12:08,553 --> 00:12:10,553
Just eat.

94
00:12:10,553 --> 00:12:14,015
Who exactly is the topic here, you or me?

95
00:12:15,789 --> 00:12:18,042
Tell me your stories. I want to know.

96
00:12:18,702 --> 00:12:21,531
There were no street food vendors like this back then.

97
00:12:21,531 --> 00:12:23,330
They just opened about two years ago.

98
00:12:23,854 --> 00:12:25,730
It was quite deserted here.

99
00:12:26,556 --> 00:12:30,116
So this is where I painted my first artwork.

100
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:31,593
Seriously?

101
00:12:31,593 --> 00:12:32,733
Yes.

102
00:12:35,155 --> 00:12:35,948
Where is it?

103
00:12:35,948 --> 00:12:37,530
I want to see it.

104
00:12:40,138 --> 00:12:42,138
Over there.

105
00:13:07,427 --> 00:13:09,040
Should we break this wall and sell it?

106
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,448
Just like Banksy.

107
00:13:12,507 --> 00:13:16,157
People in our country don’t value art that much.

108
00:13:18,002 --> 00:13:20,002
That’s true.

109
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,377
Who is this officer? Is it you?

110
00:13:29,105 --> 00:13:30,194
Yes.

111
00:13:30,194 --> 00:13:32,317
This is your first piece of work.

112
00:13:32,317 --> 00:13:34,392
There must be an interesting story behind it.

113
00:13:40,074 --> 00:13:42,074
I will never forget about it.

114
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:49,734
Want to talk about it?

115
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:52,143
If not, that’s fine.

116
00:13:55,249 --> 00:13:57,249
But I want to hear it.

117
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:06,903
Bro,

118
00:14:08,261 --> 00:14:10,489
when I tell you to run, just run.

119
00:14:15,135 --> 00:14:16,934
Good evening.

120
00:14:16,934 --> 00:14:18,429
What are you having back there?

121
00:14:18,429 --> 00:14:20,078
Just typical goods.

122
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:22,413
Can you get down here and open the truck, please?

123
00:14:22,413 --> 00:14:23,488
Of course.

124
00:14:23,921 --> 00:14:24,732
Please.

125
00:14:31,334 --> 00:14:32,742
Run!

126
00:14:34,694 --> 00:14:35,685
Follow them.

127
00:14:35,685 --> 00:14:36,934
Catch them!

128
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:40,583
Freeze!

129
00:14:41,991 --> 00:14:43,991
He has a gun.

130
00:14:56,923 --> 00:14:58,334
One casualty.

131
00:14:58,676 --> 00:15:00,046
Search for weapons.

132
00:15:00,046 --> 00:15:02,046
He’s unarmed.

133
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:07,670
Report back to the station.

134
00:15:16,304 --> 00:15:18,304
How are you holding up, Lieutenant Dan?

135
00:15:21,589 --> 00:15:23,589
Don’t get stressed out.

136
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,015
It was self-defense.

137
00:15:26,015 --> 00:15:27,991
I’ll add it to the report for you.

138
00:15:27,991 --> 00:15:29,681
I killed the man.

139
00:15:31,085 --> 00:15:33,085
Come on. He’s a criminal.

140
00:15:33,085 --> 00:15:36,945
If he’d let us arrest, this wouldn’t have happened.

141
00:15:36,945 --> 00:15:39,389
But they ran into a dark place and fired at us.

142
00:15:39,601 --> 00:15:42,574
But the casualty carried no weapons.

143
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:45,394
You couldn’t possibly know that. It was really dark.

144
00:15:45,394 --> 00:15:48,000
If they shoot, we can just shoot back.

145
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,535
If we don’t and some of us get killed, what are you going to do?

146
00:15:52,466 --> 00:15:55,081
I’ve been through a lot of this.

147
00:16:06,895 --> 00:16:08,895
That’s why you asked to be transferred here?

148
00:16:08,895 --> 00:16:10,517
Not exactly.

149
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:14,136
It’s like no one wanted to work with me.

150
00:16:14,136 --> 00:16:16,370
Someone in power needed to do something.

151
00:16:16,962 --> 00:16:19,796
Why didn’t you quit and change your job once and for all?

152
00:16:19,796 --> 00:16:22,524
Why put up being ill-treated in a small station like this?

153
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:26,187
There are people in need of help in any area.

154
00:16:26,187 --> 00:16:28,394
There are jobs for me to do everywhere.

155
00:16:28,394 --> 00:16:33,520
I’m still staying because I believe I’ll get a chance to redeem myself one day.

156
00:16:34,402 --> 00:16:37,153
Nothing can be changed right away as we wish.

157
00:16:37,153 --> 00:16:38,179
Come on.

158
00:16:38,179 --> 00:16:41,244
When will you get to do what you want if all you do is wait hopelessly?

159
00:16:41,244 --> 00:16:44,218
Do you know how fast this world changes?

160
00:16:44,881 --> 00:16:48,135
Everything has its right timing.

161
00:16:48,135 --> 00:16:52,276
Just because something changes fast doesn’t mean it’s good.

162
00:16:52,822 --> 00:16:55,633
You’re waiting for the right time, waiting to be powerful,  but when is that?

163
00:16:55,633 --> 00:16:57,178
10 years? 20 years?

164
00:16:57,178 --> 00:16:59,476
You might not have the chance at all.

165
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:03,396
Even if that day comes, everything else might collapse already.

166
00:17:03,396 --> 00:17:07,100
If you want to do or change anything, do it now.

167
00:17:07,558 --> 00:17:09,984
Don’t wait until you get burned out.

168
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:14,589
You know my stories.

169
00:17:15,915 --> 00:17:17,915
I haven’t known yours.

170
00:17:19,283 --> 00:17:21,283
Do you really want to know?

171
00:17:25,187 --> 00:17:27,187
In my life, there’s just one important thing.

172
00:17:28,334 --> 00:17:30,334
But I don’t want to tell.

173
00:17:31,629 --> 00:17:33,105
Fine.

174
00:17:33,532 --> 00:17:34,940
It’s alright if you don’t.

175
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,574
Hey, I was just kidding.

176
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,390
I’ll take you there myself.

177
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:42,741
I want you to meet her in person.

178
00:17:45,344 --> 00:17:46,798
Sounds good?

179
00:18:37,941 --> 00:18:39,941
Why got up so early?

180
00:18:40,374 --> 00:18:42,109
I don’t know.

181
00:18:42,939 --> 00:18:44,939
It’s a free day today.

182
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:47,651
I want to take you to a place.

183
00:18:47,651 --> 00:18:48,934
Want to walk there with me?

184
00:18:48,934 --> 00:18:50,813
Why aren’t we riding the bikes?

185
00:18:51,722 --> 00:18:52,561
No.

186
00:18:53,334 --> 00:18:55,147
I want to walk with you.

187
00:19:10,797 --> 00:19:12,661
Were you just pretending?

188
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:14,146
Were you?

189
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Walk on.

190
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:37,775
This is where I’m reborn after I go through something terrible.

191
00:19:39,243 --> 00:19:41,243
Do you see those poles?

192
00:19:41,243 --> 00:19:45,038
Gumpa taught me about bravery and fear right there at the poles.

193
00:19:45,447 --> 00:19:47,447
Which ones?

194
00:19:47,838 --> 00:19:49,360
There.

195
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,593
The three poles above the water.

196
00:19:52,117 --> 00:19:54,242
How did he teach you?

197
00:19:54,535 --> 00:19:56,662
Watch me. I’ll show you.

198
00:20:09,685 --> 00:20:11,685
Just keep in mind,

199
00:20:11,685 --> 00:20:13,533
if you fail, you’ll just be soaked.

200
00:20:13,533 --> 00:20:15,139
But if you’re not brave enough,

201
00:20:15,139 --> 00:20:17,514
you’ll never achieve it.

202
00:20:17,628 --> 00:20:19,633
From someone who had no life goals,

203
00:20:19,633 --> 00:20:21,863
now I have goals again.

204
00:20:26,285 --> 00:20:27,921
You try it.

205
00:20:27,921 --> 00:20:29,970
Jump and land on both feet.

206
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:31,970
Try to maintain your balance.

207
00:20:33,494 --> 00:20:35,494
It’s pretty far.

208
00:20:36,934 --> 00:20:41,560
If you can do it, you can ask me to do anything.

209
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:45,771
But if you can’t, I can ask you to do anything.

210
00:20:45,771 --> 00:20:47,298
Okay?

211
00:20:51,591 --> 00:20:52,885
Fine.

212
00:20:52,885 --> 00:20:54,487
What are you waiting for?

213
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:55,846
Jump.

214
00:20:56,424 --> 00:20:58,166
Are you scared?

215
00:21:35,915 --> 00:21:37,346
You couldn’t stand on your feet.

216
00:21:37,528 --> 00:21:39,078
You lost.

217
00:21:39,306 --> 00:21:40,582
I was just faking it.

218
00:21:40,582 --> 00:21:42,029
I could actually stand.

219
00:21:42,029 --> 00:21:43,173
Oh yeah?

220
00:21:43,173 --> 00:21:44,709
What was it then?

221
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:49,662
I…

222
00:21:50,891 --> 00:21:53,464
I just wanted to hug you.

223
00:21:56,191 --> 00:21:57,235
Damn you.

224
00:21:57,235 --> 00:21:58,231
Watch it!

225
00:21:59,466 --> 00:22:02,286
Fine. I lost.

226
00:22:02,286 --> 00:22:04,308
Ask me to do anything.

227
00:22:04,545 --> 00:22:06,654
Um…

228
00:22:07,797 --> 00:22:09,797
What should I ask?

229
00:22:09,797 --> 00:22:13,159
Do it now or I’ll change my mind.

230
00:22:14,001 --> 00:22:15,443
It can be anything, right?

231
00:22:15,443 --> 00:22:18,269
Of course. You made the rule.

232
00:22:19,782 --> 00:22:21,782
Then I’m asking you…

233
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:24,941
to…

234
00:22:28,774 --> 00:22:30,774
Can I think about it first?

235
00:22:30,774 --> 00:22:31,599
No.

236
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:33,391
Just say what you want. Now!

237
00:22:34,455 --> 00:22:36,136
You lost.

238
00:22:36,478 --> 00:22:38,478
The loser doesn’t get to bargain.

239
00:22:44,088 --> 00:22:46,088
Hey! We’re being followed.

240
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:50,866
He might have his illegal way just to deal with you guys.

241
00:22:50,866 --> 00:22:52,407
Don’t worry.

242
00:22:52,407 --> 00:22:54,407


243
00:24:09,396 --> 00:24:11,396
Hey, get in the car.

244
00:24:28,875 --> 00:24:30,246
Get down.

245
00:24:38,087 --> 00:24:39,660
Is he gone?

246
00:24:40,909 --> 00:24:41,898
He is.

247
00:24:50,746 --> 00:24:53,076
Do you believe me now that you’re being followed?

248
00:24:54,328 --> 00:24:56,328
What did you guys do?

249
00:24:58,977 --> 00:25:00,977
Fine. I won’t butt in.

250
00:25:01,616 --> 00:25:03,616
Just tell your friends to be cautious.

251
00:25:10,516 --> 00:25:12,516
Can you drive me home?

252
00:25:13,901 --> 00:25:15,070
That way.

253
00:25:29,082 --> 00:25:30,116
Come on in.

254
00:25:31,374 --> 00:25:32,880
That’s my mom.

255
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,826
Go ahead. I will store the shoes for you.

256
00:25:39,369 --> 00:25:41,369
Hello.

257
00:25:48,861 --> 00:25:50,861
Mom, this is my friend.

258
00:25:53,381 --> 00:25:55,381
(Your friend? I’ve never seen him before.)

259
00:25:56,908 --> 00:25:59,784
She’s greeting you, asking if you’re my friend.

260
00:25:59,784 --> 00:26:01,649
She has never seen you before.

261
00:26:02,337 --> 00:26:04,337
I’m not his friend.

262
00:26:04,697 --> 00:26:06,036
I’m older.

263
00:26:26,003 --> 00:26:29,148
Tawi’s manufacturer, you did it, right?

264
00:26:30,723 --> 00:26:32,049
Right.

265
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:35,553
He might have his illegal way just to deal with you guys.

266
00:26:39,875 --> 00:26:41,875
You need to be more careful.

267
00:26:41,875 --> 00:26:43,969
If I wasn’t there today, he’d follow you all the way

268
00:26:44,663 --> 00:26:48,803
until he knew where you guys are hiding.

269
00:26:50,552 --> 00:26:51,766
Okay.

270
00:26:52,305 --> 00:26:54,322
I’ll be careful.

271
00:26:54,665 --> 00:26:58,622
I think this is way more dangerous than you can handle.

272
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:06,255
Let me help.

273
00:27:11,102 --> 00:27:12,436
How can you help?

274
00:27:13,694 --> 00:27:15,866
Help keep you guys safe.

275
00:27:16,765 --> 00:27:20,114
Those unlawful things you’re doing, I can’t support you on that.

276
00:27:20,436 --> 00:27:23,792
I want to help in the part I can.

277
00:27:31,289 --> 00:27:32,596
Are you sure?

278
00:27:40,011 --> 00:27:42,011
Promise me

279
00:27:43,249 --> 00:27:45,788
if I take you to the destination,

280
00:27:48,391 --> 00:27:50,391
you won’t leave me.

281
00:27:54,304 --> 00:27:56,304
I promise.

282
00:27:59,168 --> 00:28:01,168
Words alone are not enough.

283
00:28:21,951 --> 00:28:23,373
There.

284
00:28:24,464 --> 00:28:26,464
So you won’t forget our promise.

285
00:28:40,613 --> 00:28:42,141
Gram,

286
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,998
give it to Black.

287
00:28:44,998 --> 00:28:46,741
Tell him not to miss classes too many times.

288
00:28:47,085 --> 00:28:49,085
I will.

289
00:28:56,143 --> 00:28:57,379
What’s up?

290
00:28:57,469 --> 00:28:58,935
Just finished class?

291
00:28:59,349 --> 00:29:00,459
Yeah.

292
00:29:00,742 --> 00:29:02,609
I’m so fed up.

293
00:29:02,856 --> 00:29:05,359
Why? Was it difficult?

294
00:29:06,363 --> 00:29:07,779
Look.

295
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:10,411
Legislative Drafting and Legislative Process.

296
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,480
[For Black.]

297
00:29:13,817 --> 00:29:15,877
Black missed his class again?

298
00:29:17,794 --> 00:29:19,008
Yes.

299
00:29:19,008 --> 00:29:20,800
He usually doesn’t come.

300
00:29:23,624 --> 00:29:25,624
Black has always been like this.

301
00:29:25,624 --> 00:29:28,500
I often told him to come to class.

302
00:29:28,709 --> 00:29:30,217
I know he’s smart.

303
00:29:30,217 --> 00:29:32,437
But test scores alone can’t be enough.

304
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,862
Can he even graduate?

305
00:29:36,236 --> 00:29:38,236
Why are you worried about him?

306
00:29:38,236 --> 00:29:40,423
He never cares about you.

307
00:29:40,648 --> 00:29:42,648
What’s wrong with you?

308
00:29:42,648 --> 00:29:43,982
What’s up?

309
00:29:45,641 --> 00:29:47,641
You shouldn’t be in love with someone like him.

310
00:29:48,404 --> 00:29:50,781
Do you know what he said?

311
00:29:50,781 --> 00:29:53,793
He said he didn’t love you and you should leave him alone.

312
00:29:55,788 --> 00:29:57,788
Did you talk to him?

313
00:29:58,026 --> 00:30:01,933
Yes, because I can see you still love him.

314
00:30:02,094 --> 00:30:05,202
I didn’t want him to misunderstand us so that he could get back with you.

315
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:08,095
What did you do that for?

316
00:30:08,095 --> 00:30:10,121
What you did says that I’m worthless.

317
00:30:10,256 --> 00:30:12,090
It isn’t like that, Eugene.

318
00:30:12,859 --> 00:30:16,273
You still love him and I just want you to be happy.

319
00:30:18,336 --> 00:30:20,336
Gram, so what if I love him?

320
00:30:20,646 --> 00:30:22,264
He doesn’t love me.

321
00:30:22,264 --> 00:30:24,161
Why do I need to continue loving him?

322
00:30:24,161 --> 00:30:27,287
I don’t want to be just some chick who runs after a guy.

323
00:30:27,476 --> 00:30:29,494
It’s pathetic.

324
00:30:31,858 --> 00:30:33,207
Eugene.

325
00:31:00,001 --> 00:31:03,618
Thank you for going up there to get it for me.

326
00:31:14,011 --> 00:31:14,843
Get that.

327
00:31:14,843 --> 00:31:16,442
It’s damp.

328
00:31:19,554 --> 00:31:21,554
I saved you from falling into the river.

329
00:31:21,554 --> 00:31:23,261
This can’t even compare.

330
00:31:23,404 --> 00:31:24,857
Watch your back!

331
00:31:25,329 --> 00:31:27,713
Look who you’re speaking with here, sir.

332
00:31:28,095 --> 00:31:30,036
Who in here should watch his back?

333
00:31:31,183 --> 00:31:33,183
Take it.

334
00:32:00,374 --> 00:32:02,374
Hey! We’re being followed.

335
00:32:04,004 --> 00:32:06,004
Don’t look back.

336
00:32:08,081 --> 00:32:11,653
Let’s speed up and see if they still follow us.

337
00:32:16,117 --> 00:32:19,419
Sean, make a turn up ahead. It’s a one-way road.

338
00:33:00,194 --> 00:33:02,194
It might still be safe here.

339
00:33:08,809 --> 00:33:12,583
Sean, come here.

340
00:33:21,848 --> 00:33:23,848
It’s nothing.

341
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,580
Don’t worry.

342
00:33:37,509 --> 00:33:39,509
Is it better now?

343
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:47,403
Don’t get stressed out.

344
00:34:04,239 --> 00:34:05,161
Better?

345
00:34:05,161 --> 00:34:06,299
Nope.

346
00:34:21,338 --> 00:34:22,417
Seriously,

347
00:34:22,417 --> 00:34:24,164
what’s going on between you and Black?

348
00:34:24,596 --> 00:34:26,620
It’s more than what I see, isn’t it?

349
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:28,620


350
00:34:55,268 --> 00:34:56,010
Who’s there?

351
00:34:56,035 --> 00:34:57,269
Gumpa?

352
00:35:09,459 --> 00:35:11,459
Was it like this when we came in?

353
00:35:13,881 --> 00:35:15,881
It wasn’t likely to fall.

354
00:35:23,335 --> 00:35:25,335
Just a second.

355
00:35:32,221 --> 00:35:33,845
Hi, mom.

356
00:35:33,845 --> 00:35:35,857
Did you run away from the hospital?

357
00:35:35,857 --> 00:35:38,316
I thought you wouldn’t even want to take my call.

358
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:41,087
(Black woke up?)

359
00:35:41,087 --> 00:35:43,454
(Why did he run away from the hospital?)

360
00:35:44,305 --> 00:35:48,394
You know, if it wasn’t important, I wouldn’t go back on my words and call you.

361
00:35:49,191 --> 00:35:50,387
Yes.

362
00:35:50,638 --> 00:35:52,638
I have something important to talk to you about.

363
00:35:52,871 --> 00:35:56,601
Meet me at the Chinese restaurant in the hotel we usually went to. Remember?

364
00:35:59,231 --> 00:36:00,779
I do.

365
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:03,650
See you at 2 p.m.

366
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:08,889
And don’t worry. I won’t beg for us to be mother and son again.

367
00:36:09,428 --> 00:36:11,428
Sure.

368
00:36:11,708 --> 00:36:14,683
(If Black isn’t here at the garage, he must be at his place.)

369
00:36:14,683 --> 00:36:17,807
(I must go see him now before everyone gets confused.)

370
00:36:19,656 --> 00:36:22,956
My mother called. She has something important to say.

371
00:36:24,215 --> 00:36:26,215
A judge mother?

372
00:36:29,589 --> 00:36:31,589
I think something is up.

373
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:33,152
I need to go.

374
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:34,072
Okay.

375
00:36:34,642 --> 00:36:36,985
Before you go, can I get a hug?

376
00:36:42,356 --> 00:36:43,100
Come on.

377
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,331
I’ll walk you out.

378
00:36:45,965 --> 00:36:47,965
No. I need to go.

379
00:36:48,593 --> 00:36:50,652
There’s no one here.

380
00:36:55,777 --> 00:36:57,174
Hey, Namo.

381
00:36:57,283 --> 00:36:59,283
What are you doing here?

382
00:36:59,709 --> 00:37:01,232
I came to see you.

383
00:37:01,383 --> 00:37:02,959
Can’t I come anymore?

384
00:37:04,204 --> 00:37:05,375
You can.

385
00:37:05,832 --> 00:37:08,171
I just thought you’d call first.

386
00:37:09,463 --> 00:37:10,709
I should get going.

387
00:37:30,286 --> 00:37:32,286
I couldn’t reach you all day.

388
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,700
Where have you guys been?

389
00:37:37,099 --> 00:37:39,099
We got something to do.

390
00:37:42,767 --> 00:37:44,767
So you were with him all day long.

391
00:37:46,791 --> 00:37:47,962
Yes.

392
00:37:48,791 --> 00:37:50,607
Seriously,

393
00:37:51,301 --> 00:37:54,265
what’s going on between you and Black?

394
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:59,335
You’ll thank me later for asking you to bring everything.

395
00:38:00,431 --> 00:38:02,431
We’re spying all night long.

396
00:38:03,763 --> 00:38:05,763
It’s more than what I see, isn’t it?

397
00:38:10,362 --> 00:38:11,659
Yes.

398
00:38:16,828 --> 00:38:18,049
Okay.

399
00:38:19,365 --> 00:38:21,365
That’s all I wanted to know.

400
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:26,669
No need to feel guilty or anything.

401
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,855
People’s feelings change all the time.

402
00:38:32,633 --> 00:38:34,633
Besides,

403
00:38:35,437 --> 00:38:38,090
you never asked me to be your girlfriend.

404
00:38:42,475 --> 00:38:44,475
I’m sorry.

405
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,240
It’s fine.

406
00:38:54,759 --> 00:38:56,759
I’m okay.

407
00:38:57,911 --> 00:39:00,665
You know this little thing can’t hurt me.

408
00:39:08,075 --> 00:39:10,075
I’m leaving then.

409
00:39:10,832 --> 00:39:12,832
Good luck.

410
00:39:52,508 --> 00:39:54,508
Hey, are you okay?

411
00:39:56,853 --> 00:39:58,853
Shit, what’s wrong?

412
00:39:58,853 --> 00:40:01,126
What’s the matter?

413
00:40:01,126 --> 00:40:02,705
It’s fine.

414
00:40:02,705 --> 00:40:04,320
I love him.

415
00:41:04,363 --> 00:41:06,363
Eugene, are you all right?

416
00:41:14,754 --> 00:41:16,754
I am okay.

417
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,300
If you’re not, we can rehearse some other day.

418
00:41:22,912 --> 00:41:25,565
Let’s do that then. I've been feeling down lately.

419
00:41:25,793 --> 00:41:27,859
Sorry about that, guys.

420
00:43:13,219 --> 00:43:15,219
White.

421
00:43:35,391 --> 00:43:40,431
(I'd always imagined the day I'd see my brother again.)

422
00:43:40,431 --> 00:43:42,985
(It’s supposed to be a heartwarming moment.)

423
00:43:43,161 --> 00:43:45,445
(But now it’s happening.)

424
00:43:45,445 --> 00:43:47,585
(It’s surprisingly frightening.)

425
00:43:47,945 --> 00:43:52,001
(It's as though I'm meeting my doppelganger.)

426
00:43:58,212 --> 00:43:59,383
Black.

427
00:44:00,114 --> 00:44:01,511
It’s me.

428
00:44:04,749 --> 00:44:06,749
Long time no see.

429
00:44:07,554 --> 00:44:09,350
How have you been?

430
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:10,577
Well.

431
00:44:14,217 --> 00:44:16,217
How are you, brother?

432
00:44:16,217 --> 00:44:17,492
And you?

433
00:44:19,864 --> 00:44:21,864
I’m good.

434
00:44:26,373 --> 00:44:28,373
You’re still a crying baby.

435
00:44:32,069 --> 00:44:34,589
I have so many things to say to you.

436
00:44:34,589 --> 00:44:36,804
But now that you’re in front of me,

437
00:44:37,753 --> 00:44:39,753
I become speechless.

438
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:08,203
You look so much like me, it’s creepy.

439
00:45:14,189 --> 00:45:16,189
Are you wearing my clothes?

440
00:45:17,876 --> 00:45:20,644
Are you pretending to be me?

441
00:45:21,046 --> 00:45:23,458
You were in a coma.

442
00:45:23,458 --> 00:45:25,283
I wanted to know who hurt you.

443
00:45:25,283 --> 00:45:27,504
That’s why I disguised myself and joined your gang.

444
00:45:29,589 --> 00:45:31,112
What were you thinking?

445
00:45:31,112 --> 00:45:32,727
Are you a moron?

446
00:45:39,144 --> 00:45:41,144
I just wanted to track down the one that harmed you.

447
00:45:41,144 --> 00:45:42,584
You’ve done so much for me.

448
00:45:42,584 --> 00:45:44,206
I want to return the favor.

449
00:45:44,589 --> 00:45:48,766
You made me promise to fight back those who hurt us.

450
00:45:48,766 --> 00:45:50,690
But I don’t want you to risk your life.

451
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:51,848
You aren’t scared.

452
00:45:51,848 --> 00:45:53,128
Why should I be?

453
00:45:53,128 --> 00:45:54,151
Listen to me, White.

454
00:45:54,151 --> 00:45:57,533
Those who say they aren’t afraid to die are never really at death’s door.

455
00:45:57,533 --> 00:45:59,796
I’ve been there and you don’t want to be there.

456
00:45:59,796 --> 00:46:01,561
Am I not your brother?

457
00:46:01,561 --> 00:46:03,277
You are not alone in this world.

458
00:46:03,277 --> 00:46:06,737
Mom just called and said she wanted to talk to you.

459
00:46:06,737 --> 00:46:08,353
We stopped talking a long time ago.

460
00:46:13,298 --> 00:46:15,298
Give back my phone.

461
00:46:19,938 --> 00:46:21,536
What was the fight all about?

462
00:46:21,536 --> 00:46:23,073
Did you really need to cut each other off?

463
00:46:23,073 --> 00:46:24,280
Not your business.

464
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,842
But she said she wouldn’t call if it wasn’t necessary.

465
00:46:26,842 --> 00:46:27,996
Just go see her.

466
00:46:27,996 --> 00:46:29,141
No.

467
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:31,278
Why not?

468
00:46:31,278 --> 00:46:32,576
Stay out of it.

469
00:46:34,589 --> 00:46:37,242
And how’s your condition? Are you well enough to get discharged?

470
00:46:37,242 --> 00:46:38,681
I ran away.

471
00:46:38,681 --> 00:46:41,395
How about you go back and get closely checked up?

472
00:46:56,700 --> 00:47:00,207
Apart from me, have you met anyone else?

473
00:47:00,207 --> 00:47:01,393
No.

474
00:47:01,615 --> 00:47:03,615
What about Todd?

475
00:47:05,997 --> 00:47:07,268
Did you meet him?

476
00:47:08,437 --> 00:47:10,638
He’s the one that told me about you.

477
00:47:10,638 --> 00:47:13,858
He helped me disguise and replace you in the gang.

478
00:47:14,326 --> 00:47:16,207
You’ve been deceived.

479
00:47:16,207 --> 00:47:17,913
What do you mean?

480
00:47:17,913 --> 00:47:21,111
That bastard Todd was the one that hurt me.

481
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:29,008
Directed by Anucha Boonyawatana

482
00:47:31,445 --> 00:47:32,842
Black woke up.

483
00:47:33,655 --> 00:47:35,655
Do not get close to people in my gang again.

484
00:47:35,655 --> 00:47:37,527
Go back to your own life.

485
00:47:37,527 --> 00:47:40,291
Do you truly think there aren't Tawi's rats among the authorities?

486
00:47:40,291 --> 00:47:41,949
We must have bait.

487
00:47:41,949 --> 00:47:44,714
I no longer have faith in the police.

488
00:47:45,751 --> 00:47:47,399
I know a good cop,

489
00:47:47,399 --> 00:47:49,428
someone willing to go against Tawi.

490
00:47:49,428 --> 00:47:50,420
He’s a cop.

491
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:51,234
He’s bringing us all to hell.

492
00:47:51,234 --> 00:47:52,550
I guarantee with my life.

493
00:47:52,550 --> 00:47:55,724
If he does something suspicious, I’ll kick myself out of the gang.
