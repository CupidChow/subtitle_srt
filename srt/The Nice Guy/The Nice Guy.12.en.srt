THIS DRAMA SERIES IS FICTIONAL,
AND THE PERSONS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,

3
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:46,588
SETTINGS AND EVENTS DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
SERIES HAVE BEEN FICTIONALLY CREATED

4
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:47,756
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN SAFE CONDITIONS

5
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:48,966
WITH THE CONSENT OF
AND IN THE PRESENCE OF GUARDIANS

6
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,095
Yes, I'll be there in an hour.

7
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:55,138
<i>Be careful on the way.</i>

8
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:56,890
Okay, I'll see you soon. Bye.

9
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:12,573
Sir.

10
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:14,449
We need you to come with us.

11
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:17,119
Must you do this?

12
00:01:17,703 --> 00:01:20,247
We're sorry.
Sangyeol wants to bring you over.

13
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:43,186
We lost track of him here.

14
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:46,231
Maybe he changed his clothes,
but we can't locate him.

15
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,082
Hold on.

16
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:12,841
Sir, you shouldn't park
in the middle of a road.

17
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:14,635
And pick up that cigarette butt.

18
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:15,844
Move your car, please.

19
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:20,891
Are you a thug?

20
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:22,934
Move your car.

21
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:30,859
This bastard...

<i>What are you going to do next?</i>

24
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:56,426
Are you really going to kill me
over a woman?

25
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,430
You can't do that.

26
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:02,265
That's not who you are.

27
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:05,143
Let's go back to how things were.

28
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:17,531
What do I get by doing so?

29
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:22,577
A friend

30
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:26,790
whom you can trust
and eat a meal with at ease.

34
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,121


35
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:12,335
You're here.

36
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:14,296
Sit.

37
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,966
Let's talk.

38
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:27,434
Seokcheol.

39
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:31,813
Let me ask you one last time.

40
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,775
Are you really going to resign?

41
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:38,028
If you take it back,

42
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,864
I'll quietly let it slide.

43
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:44,785
Just do it quickly.

44
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:49,372
Well...

45
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,375
Do you look down on me?

46
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,920
What do you take my words for?

47
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:58,298
You rude bastard.

48
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:02,427
When you said you wanted to resign,

49
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,346
I was like,

50
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:07,224
"I better let Seokcheol, of all people,
go peacefully."

51
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:12,687
But on second thought,
it felt a little strange. Huh?

52
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:14,773
Where were you

53
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:18,109
when the Chairman was arrested
on suspicion of using drugs?

54
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:23,031
When the police were questioning the boys,
where were you?

55
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:25,617
- Tell me.
- Are you suspecting me?

56
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,619
Yes, I am, punk.

57
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,497
I can't stop suspecting you.

58
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:34,584
When the police arrested the Chairman
for drug use,

59
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,711
you met Kang Taehoon to talk it out.

60
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:38,213
That was suspicious.

61
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:40,924
When the boys were raided
in Yeoljeong recently,

62
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,009
you were the only one who wasn't there.

63
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:44,803
That was also suspicious, bastard.

64
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:48,515
Don't tell me

65
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:51,184
Taehoon bribed you or something.

66
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:57,941
So you'll frame me like this.

67
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,317
I'm not framing you.

68
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:01,528
These are the facts, you punk!

69
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:04,948
All right.

70
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,826
Who wants to go first?

71
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:11,621
Heungman. Right, you first.

72
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:12,831
Ex... Excuse me?

73
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,166
What are you waiting for? Begin.

74
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:22,716
Come on.

75
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,139
I can't do it, sir.

76
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:30,807
You can't?

77
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:32,475
Give it to me.

78
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,857
Why can't you, bastard?

79
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:42,402
- Sir.
- Why can't you?

80
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:45,405
Do as you're told, you bastard.

81
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:48,408
Why can't you do as you're told? Why?

82
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,577
Why can't you?

83
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,246
Why the hell can't you do it,
you bastard?

84
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:05,467
All right.

85
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,136
Who else can't do it? Tell me.

86
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,263
Quickly!

87
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:13,808
You darn bastards.

88
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:19,356
All right. Then watch. I'll go first.

89
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,233
If you go easier on him than me,

90
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:24,235
I'll beat you to a pulp.

91
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:25,820
Got it?

92
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,572
Got it?

93
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:28,740
Yes, sir.

94
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:36,873
Hey, Park Seokcheol.

95
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,000
You damn traitor.

96
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:42,170
You won't be able to leave here
in one piece.

97
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:47,676
If this is because I'm a traitor,

98
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,844
I won't just take it.

99
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:52,847
What?

100
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:55,767
Are you challenging me now?

101
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,561
Don't do this.

102
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,981
I have no intention of being framed
like Taehoon was.

103
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,693
Now you even...

104
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:15,954
Hey, Park Seokcheol.

105
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:19,249
After all that humiliation I went through
because of you,

106
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,042
you dare act noble until the end?

107
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:22,377
Fine, continue.

108
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:23,920
Keep going, you bastard!

109
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,672
Do it!

110
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:28,258
Go ahead and continue, punk!

111
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,635
Go ahead!

112
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,765
<i>Seokcheol, when are you coming?</i>

113
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:07,922
Seokcheol, guess what.

114
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:11,134
I just got a brilliant idea.

115
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,854
It's actually very brilliant.
I need your help with this.

116
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:25,023
Killing two birds with one stone,
you know.

117
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,150
Two birds with one stone.

118
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:28,943
Here it is.

119
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,988
See?

120
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,532
They do text each other.

121
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,743
Look.

122
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:42,165
Close friends, aren't you?

123
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,918
I guess you get together
from time to time.

124
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,879
Then let me suggest
another get-together today.

125
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:50,799
What are you doing?

126
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:52,300
You don't get it?

127
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:55,386
I'm going to take Kang Taehoon down today.

128
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:02,977
Let me send him one text.

129
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:07,565
"Let's have eels..."

130
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:14,322
"...at that place from the other day."

131
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:16,950
Send.

132
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:29,754
<i>Let's have eels</i>
<i>at that place from the other day.</i>

133
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:37,762
<i>You better stop it here.</i>

134
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,682
How are you gonna handle this later?

135
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,476
I have no reason to do as you say.

136
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,105
Wait here today.

137
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:49,023
I'll kill him first

138
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:52,527
and come back for you, okay?

139
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:54,904
Younggi.

140
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:58,616
We'll get Kang Taehoon today.

141
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,123
Where's your answer, punk?

142
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,041
Yes.

143
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,752
Yes, sir. We'll do that.

144
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:24,934
Younggi.

145
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:26,811
Yes, sir.

146
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:28,688
Drive my car.

147
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:31,149
Yes, sir.

148
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,328
Damn it!

149
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,085
- Are you leaving work, sir?
- Yes. Give me the keys and go.

150
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:53,379
- Let me drive you.
- It's okay. Just give me the key.

151
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,048
Yes, sir.

152
00:11:56,674 --> 00:12:00,511
Bokcheon, get yourself a haircut.

153
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:02,764
Are you going to keep growing it?

154
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:07,143
Then go have it trimmed at least.

155
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:08,645
Okay?

156
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,481
You too, punk.

157
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,567
Here. Go eat something
with your girlfriend.

158
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:15,818
Punks.

159
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,612
Thank you. Where are you going, sir?

160
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,864
I'm off to meet Seokcheol.

161
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:43,221
Kang Taehoon is entering.

162
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:57,151
What an undisciplined punk.

163
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,197
He made me arrive first?

164
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:09,998
Oh.

165
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,292
The boss isn't here today?

166
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,711
No, he's got things to do.

167
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:18,089
- I'll make an order when my company comes.
- Sure.

168
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:20,758
- I'll have a bottle of beer.
- Sure.

169
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,420
TUESDAY, JUNE 18

170
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:04,802
CLOSED EVERY TUESDAY

171
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,183
What a joke.

172
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:27,450
Park Seokcheol!

173
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,329
What are you calling him for?

174
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:37,960
Taehoon.

175
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,590
It's so nice to see you here.

176
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:46,928
You didn't know, did you?

177
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:49,806
Today's the day you die.

178
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:56,813
I'll make sure to hold a memorial service
for you each year.

179
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:58,731
Go on and die.

180
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:24,924
- Come here, you fucker.
- Sir!

181
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:14,348
Mr. Chairman!

182
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:32,366
Let's go!

183
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:52,595
Sir. Sir, are you okay?

184
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,223
I'm okay.

185
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:57,516
How did you know?

186
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,560
It's obvious where you go.

187
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:01,812
We came, just in case.

188
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,106
Seokcheol...

189
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,316
Park Seokcheol.

190
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,944
Where is that bastard?

191
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,613
I've located Kang Miyoung.
I'll follow her quickly.

192
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,934
Sir. You must hurry on out.

193
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,021
Heungman.

194
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:47,567
Don't say anything,
just get out of here quickly.

195
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:50,111
Now.

196
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:52,905
There.

197
00:17:57,952 --> 00:17:58,953
Thanks.

198
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:00,037
Yeah.

199
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,070
Oh.

200
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,545
- Sir.
- What?

201
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,130
Park Seokcheol ran away.

202
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:52,840
What, you bastard?

203
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:56,719
Damn it.

204
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:58,304
What should we do?

205
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,663
JINMI LANDSCAPING

206
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,636
Seokcheol?

207
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,055
What happened to your face?

208
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:42,848
Pack up first.

209
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:44,850
- What's going on?
- Let's go first.

210
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:47,478
- What's going on?
- It's nothing. I'll explain later.

211
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:50,898
Miyoung, we must hurry.

212
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,775
What the... What's going on?

213
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,494
Sir, I need your help.

214
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,955
Give her a ride
to the express bus terminal.

215
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,289
Seokcheol.

216
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:09,041
Here. Take my car.

217
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,376
Leave it to me here and go.

218
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,420
- Hurry now.
- Okay.

219
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:13,963
Miyoung, I'll see you there.

220
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:19,093
You guys, that way.

221
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:28,728
Get him!

222
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:05,991
Move your cars!

223
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:07,076
Move!

224
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:14,351
<i>The screen doors are opening.</i>

225
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:26,071
<i>The screen doors are closing.</i>

226
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,455
Hurry up and find him now!

227
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,058
Thank you.

228
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:41,522
- Here.
- Oh.

229
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:43,607
I'm sorry I make you struggle each time.

230
00:24:44,525 --> 00:24:45,818
I can wait alone now.

231
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:49,989
Okay. Don't worry.
Seokcheol will be here soon.

232
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:52,241
Okay, thank you.

233
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,201
Take care.

234
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:21,520
Sir. Where's Miyoung?

235
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,188
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

236
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:24,982
She must be waiting inside.

237
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:27,109
Wipe that blood off your face.

238
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:30,029
Okay, thank you.

239
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:32,072
Be careful!

00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:13,530
Miyoung.

242
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:15,616
Seokcheol.

243
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:19,369
It's all right.

244
00:26:23,874 --> 00:26:24,875
Let's go.

245
00:26:28,462 --> 00:26:30,005
Get on. I'll go put the luggage in.

246
00:26:41,517 --> 00:26:42,518
Hey.

247
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,471
Oh, my goodness!

248
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:29,523
Seokcheol? Seokcheol!

249
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:30,607
Seokcheol!

250
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:32,484
Seokcheol!

251
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:34,820
Seokcheol! Seokcheol!

252
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:36,280
Seokcheol.

253
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:38,991
Seokcheol!

254
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:43,787
Seokcheol!

MYOUNGSAN POLICE STATION

268
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,350
How's Seokcheol?

269
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:35,857
I'd like to visit him in the hospital,
but the situation is...

270
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:37,901
quite awkward.

271
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:40,320
I mean, it totally seems like my doing.

272
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:43,490
Isn't it your doing?
That's what I think too.

273
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:48,704
Don't worry. I'll find who did it soon.

274
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,624
You should. You're a cop, after all.

275
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:56,211
It's awkward to face each other,
so let's go over it fast.

276
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,879
- You're Kang Taehoon, right?
- Look.

277
00:29:59,673 --> 00:30:02,092
Guess why people
keep making the same mistakes.

278
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:07,597
You make mistakes
because you focus on results.

279
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,230
Are you patronizing me?

280
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:18,984
I hear
you're old friends with him.

281
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:23,864
Park Seokcheol is the only one who gained
my respect of all the boys I know.

282
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:26,408
I don't care
whether you believe it or not,

283
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:29,828
but I feel bad just as you do.

284
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:36,084
If he'd joined my side a long time ago,
this wouldn't have happened.

285
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:40,964
Right?

286
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,258
Right.

287
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:45,886
We fought over a woman.

288
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,264
You know her too, right?

289
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,141
Kang Miyoung.

290
00:30:51,892 --> 00:30:53,727
Why would you bring her up?

291
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:56,772
I'm telling you to focus on the cause,
not the result.

292
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,648
Everything started from there.

293
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:02,736
- What are you saying?
- I told you.

294
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:06,615
You need to know what caused it
to understand the result.

295
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:10,994
<i>Get out now.</i>

296
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:12,496
Hurry up.

297
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:16,249
Move.

298
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:32,182
Miyoung, I know it's hard,
but please look more carefully.

299
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:43,235
I'm sorry.

300
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:47,572
I don't remember anything from that day
because I was losing myself.

301
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:51,701
Hey. Tell numbers 2 and 3 to change caps.

302
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:53,161
Numbers 2 and 3, change caps.

303
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:00,752
Miyoung.

304
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,261
Gosh, I can't tell.

305
00:32:10,554 --> 00:32:12,139
It's all right. Thanks.

306
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:14,224
- Escort her out.
- Yes, sir.

307
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:16,476
This way, please.

308
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:29,364
How's Seokcheol?

309
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:33,368
He isn't awake yet.

310
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:44,087
Byeongsoo, if you're looking for
the one who stabbed Seokcheol,

311
00:32:44,171 --> 00:32:45,463
you're going the wrong direction.

312
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:47,549
None of the evidence says we did it.

313
00:32:48,884 --> 00:32:51,094
You guys and Changsoo's gang
are enemies, no?

314
00:32:51,178 --> 00:32:53,513
Who else would stab him if not you people?

315
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:57,309
We didn't do it.

316
00:32:57,851 --> 00:32:59,895
We didn't even know he was stabbed.

317
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:01,688
Bastard.

318
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,399
He's your elder, not your friend.

319
00:33:06,193 --> 00:33:07,194
Let's stop.

320
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:09,279
You people did it, didn't you?

321
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:11,406
Come clean.

322
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:14,534
I said I don't know.

323
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:17,287
All I know is that

324
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:21,249
he deserved to get stabbed.

325
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:24,252
You know what I mean.

326
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:29,716
- Oh! Guys, stop him!
- Hurry up.

327
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,510
You punk.

328
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,764
He's in a coma, you bastard.

329
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:37,766
That's great.

330
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:39,517
What?

331
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:40,644
- Hey.
- Sir.

332
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:42,062
- Sir.
- Let go.

333
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:44,397
- Calm down!
- Byeongsoo!

334
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:46,733
TRUSTED POLICE WHO ARE WITH PEOPLE

335
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:48,860
Oh, Byeongsoo.

336
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:51,738
Go check on Seokcheol
if you have time to accuse me.

337
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:54,074
I don't know who stabbed him,

338
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:58,745
but if it were me,
I wouldn't keep him alive.

339
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:42,622
MYOUNGSAN HOSPITAL

340
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:47,252
Excuse me, miss.

341
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:50,213
Where is Room 2111?

342
00:34:50,297 --> 00:34:52,090
Use the elevator over there.

343
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:53,466
Oh, thank you.

344
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:03,560
Dad.

345
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:04,769
Hey.

346
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,189
Hello.

347
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:11,443
Yes, hello.

348
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:15,655
You must be my son's girlfriend.

349
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,827
The surgery went well.

350
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:25,040
It might take time for him to recover,
but don't worry.

351
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:27,208
I see.

352
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:34,257
Oh, can I have some time alone
with Seokcheol?

353
00:35:34,341 --> 00:35:35,967
Sure.

354
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,421
Seokcheol.

355
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:15,715
Seokcheol, you brat.

356
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:17,550
Your father's here.

357
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:20,887
Open your eyes.

358
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:29,938
This is...

359
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,650
my fault.

360
00:36:36,403 --> 00:36:40,824
I shouldn't have put you in this world.

361
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:45,954
I didn't even

362
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:50,083
get to say sorry to you, brat.

363
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:18,862
I'm glad he has you by his side.

364
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:21,448
Please take good care of him.

365
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:23,450
I will.

366
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,538
Dad, do you need a ride?

367
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:32,477
<i>Walking with you like this,</i>
<i>I feel like we're back in our childhood.</i>

368
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,561
<i>Don't you agree?</i>

369
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:39,275
Do you like this neighborhood?

370
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:41,611
Uh...

371
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:43,446
I'm not sure.

372
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:47,534
I was born here, and I grew up here.
I've never even wondered if I liked it.

373
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:49,077
Hmm.

374
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:53,832
I used to hate this neighborhood
because it held bad memories.

375
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:57,585
But on second thought,

376
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:01,089
my happiest memory also took place here.

377
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:06,344
<i>Do you still read a lot?</i>

378
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:09,472
When we were younger,
you read a lot of books

379
00:39:09,556 --> 00:39:12,392
and won many writing contests.

380
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:17,981
<i>So I thought you'd become</i>
<i>a successful poet or novelist.</i>

381
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:19,524
THE SUN ALSO RISES

382
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,109
<i>Goodness. You read books?</i>

383
00:39:21,985 --> 00:39:22,986
Leave it.

384
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:25,530
Hemingway. I know him too.

385
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:27,323
<i>"The Snows of Kilimandaro," right?</i>

386
00:39:34,664 --> 00:39:37,417
<i>Your dream was to become</i>
<i>a novelist, but you became a thug.</i>

387
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,253
<i>I used to get into fights all the time,</i>
<i>but I'm a cop today.</i>

388
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:45,133
<i>"I kept the first for another day.</i>

389
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,136
<i>"Yet knowing how way leads on to way,</i>

390
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:51,097
"I doubted if I should ever come back."

391
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:52,640
All together.

392
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:56,352
"I shall be telling this with a sigh

393
00:39:56,436 --> 00:39:59,522
"somewhere ages and ages hence.

394
00:39:59,606 --> 00:40:00,607
"Two roads..."

395
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:03,985
<i>How come? There's a writer from</i>
<i>another country who was once a gangster.</i>

396
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:05,069
He writes romance books.

397
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:07,739
If my colleagues find out,
they'll be shocked to death.

398
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:10,325
So what if they find out about it?

399
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,327
You're going to resign anyway.

400
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,581
Anyway, did you talk to the company?

401
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,501
I'm going to.

402
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:22,170
Just do it already.

403
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:23,755
You made a decision. Don't hesitate.

404
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:24,923
I'm counting on you.

405
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:29,802
<i>I didn't come to save you.</i>

406
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,764
I want to quit my job as a thug.

407
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:36,643
<i>But I can't do that if you die in here.</i>

408
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:45,860
<i>Dad!</i>

409
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:48,696
<i>- Dad!</i>
- <i>You can't go up there!</i>

410
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:51,115
<i>Dad, Dad!</i>

411
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,225
- Would you like to order?
- What?

412
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:47,046
You may end up getting hurt, Seokcheol.

413
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:50,591
Are you really going to kill me
over a woman?

414
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:03,438
<i>Come out, you bastards.</i>

415
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:06,482
Come out!

416
00:42:07,984 --> 00:42:10,528
I've heard you're a good fighter.

417
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:16,951
My God, look at that stare!

418
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:21,581
He's ready.

419
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,333
<i>Are you really going to resign?</i>

420
00:42:24,417 --> 00:42:26,461
If you take it back,

421
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:29,047
I'll quietly let it slide.

422
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:30,590
Just do it quickly.

423
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:42,852
You may expect something
from this line of work,

424
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:44,312
but there's nothing here.

425
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:49,859
There's nothing you're looking for.

426
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:53,988
<i>It isn't here.</i>

427
00:43:07,043 --> 00:43:08,044
Seokcheol.

428
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:10,046
It's all right.

429
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:32,360
<i>Seokcheol!</i>

430
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,321
Seokcheol!

431
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:38,741
Seokcheol!

432
00:44:34,714 --> 00:44:35,715
Seokcheol.

433
00:44:47,602 --> 00:44:48,603
Seokhee.

434
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:50,354
- Hey.
- How's Seokcheol?

435
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:52,648
He's okay.
He's going through a few checkups.

436
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,655
He just has to rest a bit.

437
00:44:59,739 --> 00:45:00,740
Thank you.

438
00:45:11,876 --> 00:45:13,920
Punk.

439
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:29,727
YOUNGEST DAUGHTER

440
00:45:31,771 --> 00:45:32,772
Hello?

441
00:45:33,773 --> 00:45:34,815
I see.

442
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:37,235
Thank goodness.

443
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:40,821
Okay, good job. Thanks. Bye.

444
00:45:45,785 --> 00:45:48,162
Honey, come and have a taste of this.

445
00:46:00,049 --> 00:46:01,300
What the... What's wrong with you?

446
00:46:01,384 --> 00:46:02,718
Maksoon.

447
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:05,972
You went through a lot.

448
00:46:06,055 --> 00:46:08,683
Thank you for all your trouble, Maksoon.

449
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:15,773
You punk.
You were unconscious for quite some time.

450
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:17,775
I wondered if you'd ever wake up.

451
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:20,987
We almost paid our condolences
at your funeral.

452
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:23,698
That would've been quite a scene.

453
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:25,616
- Right.
- Of course.

454
00:46:26,659 --> 00:46:28,953
It's torture to see you

455
00:46:29,704 --> 00:46:30,830
as soon as I woke up.

456
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,041
What's with you all?

457
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:36,585
You went through a lot.

458
00:46:37,253 --> 00:46:39,839
No, you went through a lot.

459
00:46:41,257 --> 00:46:43,217
No, she went through a lot.

460
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:45,011
She stayed by your side sleeplessly.

461
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:50,433
I'm sick of seeing you asleep
thanks to it.

462
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,521
But then,

463
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:58,065
I'm still sleepy.

464
00:46:58,149 --> 00:47:00,318
Because your body is recovering.

465
00:47:00,401 --> 00:47:01,485
Sleep on.

466
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:05,656
It's good

467
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:09,201
to see you all again.

468
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:29,930
Sir.

469
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:32,391
Park Seokcheol is awake.

470
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:35,853
Is he?

471
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:41,025
And the police are suspecting us
to be behind this case.

472
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:46,864
They got us good.

473
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:00,127
You're awake?

474
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:02,254
Yes.

475
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:07,885
You're still here?

476
00:48:08,511 --> 00:48:10,179
Yes, I waited to have a talk.

477
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:12,348
Miyoung, give us some time alone.

478
00:48:13,057 --> 00:48:14,433
- Sure.
- No.

479
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:16,227
We can talk outside.

480
00:48:17,061 --> 00:48:18,896
- Can you get up?
- Yes.

481
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:21,816
I was in bed for too long.
I need some air.

482
00:48:29,824 --> 00:48:31,700
Goodness.

483
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:35,496
Luckily, it wasn't an expert.

484
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:37,289
Well...

485
00:48:37,373 --> 00:48:39,750
If he'd stabbed you
and turned the knife...

486
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:41,836
It could've been horrible.

487
00:48:43,254 --> 00:48:44,588
Do you remember his face?

488
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:46,799
The one who stabbed you.

489
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:00,938
I don't remember.

490
00:49:04,984 --> 00:49:09,572
Let's talk more later.
I'm going in.

491
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:13,784
It's all right. I'm good.

492
00:49:18,122 --> 00:49:19,415
Take care of yourself, punk.

493
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:35,806
Seokcheol...

494
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:38,809
woke up?

495
00:49:38,893 --> 00:49:41,270
Yes, he woke up last night.

496
00:49:48,903 --> 00:49:50,529
- That's a relief.
- Right.

497
00:49:50,613 --> 00:49:52,323
I'll go visit him today.

498
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:56,285
What for?
He didn't die. Isn't that good enough?

499
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:58,287
But he got stabbed.

500
00:49:58,370 --> 00:49:59,955
Shouldn't we find who did it?

501
00:50:00,039 --> 00:50:01,790
Hey, that's not the problem.

502
00:50:01,874 --> 00:50:03,375
The problem is Kang Taehoon.

503
00:50:03,459 --> 00:50:05,669
After what we did to him,
he'll take action.

504
00:50:05,753 --> 00:50:07,796
I get it, so get out, all of you.

505
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:09,089
Yes, sir.

506
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:23,646
Things are getting twisted like hell.

507
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:40,037
It's nice.

508
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:42,248
- I know, right?
- Hmm.

509
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:45,042
Will you write lyrics for this?

510
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:47,920
- Me?
- Hmm.

511
00:50:49,088 --> 00:50:51,006
But don't make it too sad.

512
00:50:51,507 --> 00:50:52,633
I'm done with sad stuff.

513
00:50:55,344 --> 00:50:57,096
Okay, I'll give it a try.

514
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,265
But no teasing, okay?

515
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:01,600
I'd never. I'm rather excited.

516
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:11,360
Seokcheol...

517
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:12,736
Oh, you're with someone.

518
00:51:14,947 --> 00:51:15,948
So,

519
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:18,367
are you feeling okay?

520
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:22,329
- Miyoung, give us a moment.
- Okay.

521
00:51:27,585 --> 00:51:28,669
Excuse me.

522
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:52,359
Hello?

523
00:51:55,988 --> 00:51:56,989
Oh, yes.

524
00:52:03,579 --> 00:52:04,872
Goodness.

525
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:08,292
It's obvious who did this to you.

526
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:11,879
Kang Taehoon, right?

527
00:52:12,421 --> 00:52:16,383
Damn, I should've killed him
that day. Tsk!

528
00:52:18,886 --> 00:52:20,220
Seokcheol,

529
00:52:21,305 --> 00:52:22,848
do you perhaps

530
00:52:23,891 --> 00:52:27,436
remember the guy who stabbed you?

531
00:52:30,314 --> 00:52:31,315
You don't remember?

532
00:52:32,358 --> 00:52:35,527
I mean,
do you vaguely remember how he looked,

533
00:52:35,611 --> 00:52:36,820
or have someone in mind?

534
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:40,991
Why?

535
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:46,580
If I do, will you avenge me?

536
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:51,460
If you remember,
I'll find him and avenge you.

537
00:52:58,092 --> 00:52:59,093
I don't.

538
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:02,179
You don't?

539
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:04,098
It can't be helped, then.

540
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:05,182
Oh, right.

541
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:07,976
I found your phone with me.

542
00:53:10,354 --> 00:53:11,605
Here you go.

543
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:13,899
I'll get going.

544
00:53:13,982 --> 00:53:15,234
Take good care of yourself.

545
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:17,736
Oh, right.

546
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:20,531
Is that your girlfriend?

547
00:53:21,949 --> 00:53:23,325
She's pretty.

548
00:53:24,368 --> 00:53:25,411
Be good to her, punk.

549
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:56,150
This is the suspect
of Seokcheol's recent car accident.

550
00:53:57,526 --> 00:54:00,571
He may have stabbed him
at the terminal too.

551
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:03,991
Do you recognize him?

552
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:10,914
Seokcheol? Seokcheol!

553
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:12,541
Seokcheol!

554
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:14,209
Seokcheol!

555
00:54:15,002 --> 00:54:16,545
Seokcheol!

556
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:19,465
Oh, my goodness!

557
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:26,889
I'm not sure.
I lost track of everything back then.

558
00:54:32,436 --> 00:54:35,481
Are you the one
behind Seokcheol's accident?

559
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:37,524
Yes.

560
00:54:38,901 --> 00:54:39,902
I am behind it.

561
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:45,365
That man said that
he was behind Seokcheol's car accident.

562
00:54:47,201 --> 00:54:48,202
Who?

563
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:51,538
Kang Taehoon?

564
00:54:53,582 --> 00:54:54,666
Yes.

565
00:54:55,167 --> 00:54:59,046
Whoever this man is in the picture,
it was his order.

566
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:03,383
I don't want anyone
to hurt Seokcheol again.

567
00:55:05,844 --> 00:55:08,180
I understand. Please wait a little.

568
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:12,809
We need concrete evidence
if we're going to arrest Kang Taehoon.

569
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:15,896
We'll hurry as much as we can.
Don't worry.

570
00:55:30,619 --> 00:55:32,329
Goodness. Seokcheol?

571
00:55:32,955 --> 00:55:33,956
Mom.

572
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:36,041
What happened?

573
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:38,418
Mom was worried sick
because you were out of reach.

574
00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:40,087
- Is it Seokcheol?
- Yes.

575
00:55:40,671 --> 00:55:41,672
Where are you?

576
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:44,633
I was out of the city for some business

577
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:47,177
when I lost my phone.

578
00:55:47,261 --> 00:55:49,012
You could've called sooner.

579
00:55:50,264 --> 00:55:52,599
- Let me talk to Mom.
<i>- Okay.</i>

580
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:54,601
He wants to talk to you.

581
00:55:54,685 --> 00:55:56,853
Hey, are you sure nothing happened?

582
00:55:57,771 --> 00:56:01,233
Of course, nothing happened.

583
00:56:01,984 --> 00:56:03,235
Give your father a call.

584
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:05,445
He didn't show it,
but he was very worried.

585
00:56:07,406 --> 00:56:08,907
<i>When are you coming home?</i>

586
00:56:09,658 --> 00:56:11,326
It might take some more time.

587
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:13,620
I see. It must be tough.

588
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,081
- Don't skip meals, okay?
<i>- Okay.</i>

589
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:20,669
What did he say? Is he with a woman?

590
00:56:21,295 --> 00:56:22,546
As if.

591
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:26,758
Seokcheol is old enough.
He must be on a trip with a woman.

592
00:56:26,842 --> 00:56:29,261
Can't you tell? You're so dull.

593
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:32,848
Stop being silly and go to work.
Aren't you late?

594
00:56:32,931 --> 00:56:35,892
I'm on my way.
We were worried for nothing.

595
00:56:35,976 --> 00:56:39,062
- He sure is with a woman.
- Goodness gracious. Have a good day.

596
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:04,504
Let's clink, sir.

597
00:57:08,008 --> 00:57:11,511
Just what's gotten into you?
People are talking everywhere.

598
00:57:12,012 --> 00:57:13,013
Is it your doing?

599
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:15,557
The stabbing at the terminal.

600
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:17,267
Oh.

601
00:57:17,351 --> 00:57:18,644
Sir, we are

602
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:21,355
- not behind it.
- Yeah, right.

603
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,732
The victim is part of Changsoo's gang.

604
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:26,026
Anyone would think you did it.

605
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:27,861
Sir.

606
00:57:29,029 --> 00:57:30,656
Please calm down.

607
00:57:31,323 --> 00:57:33,492
You know I've never let you down.

608
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:35,077
Let me tell you again.

609
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:37,079
I'm not involved in it.

610
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:38,705
Goodness.

611
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:40,415
So this is how you'll behave.

612
00:57:40,499 --> 00:57:41,750
Unbelievable.

613
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:45,003
Chairman Kang, listen carefully.

614
00:57:45,087 --> 00:57:46,588
Before this case gets bigger,

615
00:57:46,672 --> 00:57:49,800
find the one who did it
and have him turn himself in.

616
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:53,970
If you don't want to take the fall,
make your underling take responsibility.

617
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:15,492
MIYOUNG

618
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:21,331
Hello?

619
00:58:22,624 --> 00:58:23,625
Let's meet.

620
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:26,336
I'll come to you.

621
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:52,446
Sir.

622
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:56,074
I'm sorry.

623
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:13,592
<i>We've heard a lot</i>
<i>about you, sir!</i>

624
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:16,011
Jang Wooseok of Myoungsan High School,
42nd batch.

625
00:59:17,179 --> 00:59:18,472
It's my book report on Kim Ku.

626
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:20,849
You said you'd take me in if I wrote it.

627
00:59:20,932 --> 00:59:22,476
I want to be like you.

628
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:23,685
No matter what you say,

629
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:25,979
I'll devote my life to this.

630
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:27,272
Please let me in.

631
01:00:02,808 --> 01:00:03,892
The Nice Guy

632
01:00:04,226 --> 01:00:05,435
<i>What about Oh Sangyeol?</i>

633
01:00:05,519 --> 01:00:07,979
<i>He has five to six men tag along</i>
<i>wherever he goes.</i>

634
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:09,606
<i>It's not easy to take him down.</i>

635
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:11,608
<i>Why did you do that to me?</i>

636
01:00:12,484 --> 01:00:14,069
<i>Why did you try to kill me?</i>

637
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:16,780
<i>And you killed Wooseok.</i>

638
01:00:17,489 --> 01:00:18,490
<i>If things go south,</i>

639
01:00:18,573 --> 01:00:21,201
<i>it will be worse</i>
<i>than getting hurt for you.</i>

640
01:00:22,244 --> 01:00:24,412
<i>I know,</i>
<i>but I need to see the end of it.</i>

641
01:00:25,247 --> 01:00:26,248
He always has his way.

642
01:00:26,331 --> 01:00:27,457


643
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:33,171


644
01:00:34,548 --> 01:00:35,549
Seokcheol!

645
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:36,675
Park Seokcheol!

646
01:00:41,388 --> 01:00:42,514
Must you do this?

647
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:46,977
<i>At crossroads,</i>
<i>you don't always have to make a choice.</i>

648
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:49,688
<i>I'd like the rest of my life</i>
<i>to be meaningful at least.</i>

649
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:51,273
<i>That's why I'm doing this.</i>
