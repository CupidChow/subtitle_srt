The Nice Guy

00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:45,295
THIS DRAMA SERIES IS FICTIONAL,
AND THE PERSONS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,

3
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:46,588
SETTINGS AND EVENTS DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
SERIES HAVE BEEN FICTIONALLY CREATED

4
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:47,756
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN SAFE CONDITIONS

5
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:48,966
WITH THE CONSENT OF
AND IN THE PRESENCE OF GUARDIANS

6
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:52,803
"On the Way Home"
by Park Seokcheol.

7
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:53,887
PREVIOUSLY

8
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:56,265
"My slippers sink deep in the snow..."

9
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:58,517
<i>- I wanted to become a poet.</i>

10
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,436
Does Seokcheol seem like
he was born to be a thug?

11
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,605
It's all because of your family.

12
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:05,983
<i>Generations of thugs,</i>
<i>starting with your father.</i>

13
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,359
<i>Seokcheol.</i>

14
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:10,571
<i>My sun has risen again.</i>

15
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,573
<i>That Miyoung from our childhood?</i>

16
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:14,533
You guys liked each other so much
back then.

17
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:18,787
<i>Are you going to get serious?</i>

18
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:21,415
You may not know,

19
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:24,376
but he wouldn't be like this
had he not gotten expelled.

20
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:27,713
<i>What happened to you</i>
<i>after I left this neighborhood...</i>

21
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,631
<i>Why didn't you tell me anything?</i>

22
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:33,510
I don't regret it.

23
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:36,471
<i>I'm performing here</i>
<i>starting today.</i>

24
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,603
Have just one glass.

25
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:45,230
I need to go meet my boyfriend.

26
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:47,357
Park Seokcheol.

27
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:49,318
Why does it have to be you?

28
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:52,487
Are you interested
in getting ready with us?

29
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:54,489
<i>To make a debut as a singer.</i>

30
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:58,910
What are you doing?

31
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:00,787
Miyoung's dream is to be a singer.

32
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:02,664
And why would you help her?

33
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:04,333
Because you can't.

34
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:09,004
It's a reminder from the bank.

35
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:12,341
368 million won?

36
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:15,594
Thanks to your older sister,
we might end up going broke.

37
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:19,389
Uncle, haven't you found my mom yet?

38
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:20,807
Do you miss her a lot?

39
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:21,933


40
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:24,895
All right, ladies and gentlemen.
You heard the cuckoo.

41
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,396
Have two chips ready, please.

42
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:31,151
I found out where Seokkyung was.

43
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:34,613
<i>That must be it.</i>

44
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:37,532
It might seem like a club,
but it's actually a gambling house.

45
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:39,451
<i>How could you hide</i>
<i>in a place like this?</i>

46
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,203
- They're my little siblings.
Get out of my way!

47
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:42,663


48
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:44,247


49
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:45,332


50
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:46,917
Seokkyung, where's your stuff?

51
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:49,127
He asked you a question.

52
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:51,088
In a dorm room.

53
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:56,468
I miss my Hyeonggeun so much.

54
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,762
So why did you do something like that?

55
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:03,475


56
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:04,643
Oh, I can't help it.

57
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,191
Mom?

58
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:15,737
Don't tell your grandma
that you met me here.

59
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:19,491
<i>I'll come back to see you for sure.</i>

60
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,786
GEUMMYEONG BANK

61
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:27,958
If you want an extension, you'll need to
pay back some of the principal.

62
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:31,711
You're not here to ask him for money,
are you?

63
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:35,674
You know well
that I have to work to make up for it!

64
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,051
You know my son, right?

65
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:40,679
Give him a job at your company.

66
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:44,015
The money you send to my house
can be considered as his salary.

67
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,100
Does that work for you?

68
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:49,271
<i>I shouldn't have</i>
<i>done that to him.</i>

69
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:51,523
A car pawnbroker?

70
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:54,234
Go to Gangwon-do with me.
Let's get down to this business.

71
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:57,028
You know car pawnbrokers can make
100 million won a year

72
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:58,405
<i>once they settle down.</i>

73
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:02,242
<i>Work hard for just one year,</i>
<i>and go home with money.</i>

74
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:05,954
<i>Mom, take care of Hyeonggeun</i>
<i>for me for one more year.</i>

75
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:07,622
<i>I'm too ashamed to face you now.</i>

76
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,749
- Goodness.
Mother!

77
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,752
Grandma, the flowers have bloomed
on Mom's tree.

78
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:18,175
<i>I prayed that Mom would come home</i>
<i>when flowers bloomed on her tree.</i>

79
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,260


80
00:04:57,756 --> 00:04:59,424
Hyeonggeun!

81
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:02,928
Hyeonggeun!

82
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:07,349
Ms. Jo Maksoon!

83
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,688
Mr. Park Silgon!

84
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:17,776
Mom?

85
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:20,362
Mom!

86
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:22,948
Your foolish daughter

87
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,867
is back home!

88
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,120
Mom!

89
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:33,583
Father!

90
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:35,710
Mom!

91
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,880
Hyeonggeun!

92
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:53,144
- Hyeonggeun.
- Mom.

93
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,943
Mom.

94
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,112
What are you waiting for? Hurry in.

95
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,074
- What about Father?
- What about him?

96
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,951
Go in and beg him for forgiveness.

97
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,037
Let him cuss you out and beat you up.

98
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:14,833
You must've braced yourself for it
before making this ruckus.

99
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,252
No, don't hit my mom.

100
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:19,170
How tearjerking.

101
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:22,424
Hyeonggeun, she'll only take
a slight beating.

102
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:30,223
Hyeonggeun, I am prepared for it.

103
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:32,601
You get punished for your misdeeds.

104
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:35,228
No, you didn't do anything wrong.

105
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:38,315
I did wrong in many ways.

106
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:43,236
I brought tears to your beautiful eyes,
for one thing.

107
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,447
I deserve a scolding.

108
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,824
Don't cry.

109
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,409
I'm home.

110
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:53,163
So smile.

111
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:58,501
Come on in. Hurry up.

112
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,551
Father.

113
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,512
I'm home.

114
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,563
Father, I'm sorry.

115
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,692
I've reflected a lot on myself.

116
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:25,320
Dad. Seokkyung was staying at my place.

117
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:26,738
Father, please.

118
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,448
Honey, she says she's sorry.

119
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:29,532
- Move over.
- Gosh.

120
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:30,617
You--

121
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,118
Hyeonggeun is watching!

122
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,665
I'm sorry, Father.

123
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:39,668
Beat me up and cuss me out.

124
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:41,002
I'll take it all.

125
00:07:58,228 --> 00:07:59,354
Have you eaten?

126
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:05,985
I haven't.

127
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:10,365
Feed her.

128
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:29,968
All right. Eat up.

129
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:34,139
You've loved bulgogi
since you were a child.

130
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:38,935
What is it?
Does seeing Mom's food make you tear up?

131
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,037
Hold back your tears and eat
or you'll get indigestion.

132
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:06,588
It's delicious.

133
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,605
The Nice Guy

134
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,762
It's like a feast.
Right, Hyeonggeun?

135
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:57,972
Eat up.

136
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,728
Father, have some <i>dongchimi.</i>

137
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:06,064
You like it.

138
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:21,788
Mom, have this dried laver.

139
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:23,706
One more.

140
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,417
Thanks.

141
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:31,256
Hey, I eat dried laver too.

142
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,340
Please.

143
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:33,716
One for you too.

144
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,636
What about me? Give me one too.

145
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,141
For your grandpa too.

146
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:42,600
Grandpa.

147
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,561
I'm good.

148
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,230
It's from your grandson. Have it.

149
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,983
Grandpa.

150
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,277
Don't be angry, and live long.

151
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:57,365
You wish me a long life
over just a sheet of dried laver?

152
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,465
One, two, three.

153
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:17,385
- One, two, three.
- What are you doing? We're eating.

154
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,596
- Dad, just once. Come on.
- Jeez.

155
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,347
One, two, three.

156
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:25,351
Thank you.

157
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,523
EAST SEOUL - GANGNEUNG - SOKCHO

158
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,950
My sister's back home.

159
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,744
That's great.

160
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:44,913
It must be a family photo.

161
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:46,623
- Is he Hyeonggeun?
- Yes.

162
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,333
How adorable.

163
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,542
He looks like you.

164
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,044
- You think so?
- Yes.

165
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,213
- You want to see his baby photos?
- Yes.

166
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:55,673
- Here.
- Gosh, he's so adorable.

167
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:58,468
- It's when he was a baby.
- Goodness. Look at his smile.

168
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:02,430
If I get a chance,
I'll show you my family.

169
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:04,557
I'd love that.

170
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:09,479
How adorable.

171
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,315
He thinks he's all grown up now.
He's very opinionated.

172
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,567
- But he looks so docile.
- Right, he is.

173
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,662
Want me to go buy some water?

174
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:26,788
- Okay.
- I'll be right back.

175
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:32,710
- Welcome.
- Hello.

176
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:34,003
Water... Oh, it's here.

177
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,839
- Two bottles.
- It's 2,000 won.

178
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:37,924
Okay.

179
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:40,426
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

180
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,011
- Thank you.
- Bye.

181
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:07,578
All right.

182
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:09,706
- Here.
- Thanks.

183
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:14,544
Let's go.

184
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:40,945
ONE UNREAD MESSAGE

185
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:23,821
Here's your order.
Who ordered the latte?

186
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:25,907
- Here.
- Sure. Enjoy.

187
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:29,077
- Enjoy your drinks.
- Thank you.

188
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,369
Excuse me.

189
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:31,496
Yes?

190
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:35,374
The car is too old.
Its transmission needs to be fixed.

191
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,710
Each valve needs to be cleaned too.

192
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:40,296
That's too much work.
I just want it to be able to move.

193
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,715
It's your car. I'm being extra attentive.

194
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:45,718
Thanks to you,
I quit being a gangster and started this.

195
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:53,643
- Taejoon.
- Yes?

196
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,647
It's good to see how you are now.

197
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,777
Well, it was awkward at first.

198
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:05,822
But I don't have to glare at others.

199
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,615
I feel like I've become a good son.

200
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:09,242
My mom is happy.

201
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,493
Thank you, sir.

202
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:12,578
Good job.

203
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:14,664
It might take three to four days.

204
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,833
Use my car in the meantime.

205
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,709
No, that's not necessary.

206
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:20,419
If you feel bad borrowing it,
just keep it.

207
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,300
Here's the key, sir.

208
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,888
Hey, it's a mess.
I think it's actually okay to keep it.

209
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:32,807
It's got no problem.

210
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:35,810
Are you coming
to Younggi's birthday dinner today?

211
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:36,978
Today's his birthday?

212
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,896
Yes, he's treating us at Yeoljeong.

213
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,608
I doubt I have any reason to go there.

214
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:47,446
Taejoon, you left this field,
so stop meeting them too.

215
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,740
Well, that's not easy.

216
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:52,243
I'll take time.

217
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:53,995
I understand.

218
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,163
- Thanks.
- No problem.

219
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:58,791
- Good-bye.
- Bye.

220
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:08,050
SEOKCHEOL

221
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:10,511
SEOKHEE

222
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:12,972
SEOKKYUNG
HYEONGGEUN

223
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,446
Let me see.

224
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,870
Dang. All my clothes are stupid.

225
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:42,043
- Are you going somewhere?
- Father.

226
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:44,378
Are you going somewhere?

227
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,985
- Are you going somewhere?
- Somewhere nearby.

228
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,737
- Do you want a lift?
- No, thanks.

229
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,697
Well, Seokkyung...

230
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,044
I'm home.

231
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:27,171
Hey.

232
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:28,256
Goodness.

233
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:30,299
- Who are you?
- It's not funny.

234
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:33,094
Why are you so dressed up?
Going somewhere?

235
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:37,807
Hyeonggeun's school.
He has an open class today.

236
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:40,226
So you're playing parent.

237
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,186
I intend to do everything I couldn't.

238
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:45,565
It's easier said than done.

239
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,984
- Have you eaten?
- Yes, I have.

240
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,610
How about some coffee outside?

241
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:51,696
Sure.

242
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:58,911
Did you sleep well?

243
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:03,040
You think I did?
It took me so much to return home.

244
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:09,422
Gosh, I couldn't sleep.
I was reminded of the old times.

245
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:11,924
What old times?

246
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:16,679
You know,
when you, Seokhee, and I were little.

247
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,556
When we lived here together.

248
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,642
- Those were the good times.
- Goodness.

249
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,354
Says someone who was hardly at home.

250
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:27,732
Hey.

251
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,984
I didn't know back then.

252
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:32,028
If I had known what I know now,

253
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,989
I would've stopped you
when you said you'd join a gang.

254
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:37,575
Grandpa, Father, and you.
For three generations. Really?

255
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,160
Shush, it's embarrassing.

256
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,579
So you know it's embarrassing.

257
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:49,754
You see,

258
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,840
when I said I'd join a gang,

259
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,635
I expected you'd stop me.

260
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:59,430
I honestly wanted you to stop me.

261
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,643
But...

262
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:04,810
...you didn't say a thing.

263
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,189
I thought you wouldn't last long

264
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:10,524
as if it was temporary

265
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:12,985
because you weren't like Father.

266
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:16,822
But I didn't expect you to last

267
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:18,866
this long.

268
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:20,076
Huh.

269
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,162
I'm sorry.

270
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:25,956
I shouldn't have let you do it.

271
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,337
Don't be sorry. It was my decision.

272
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:37,093
Like you say, it should've been temporary,
but it happened to last long.

273
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:41,097
Do you regret it?

274
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:44,809
Regret...

275
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:48,229
I guess, if you say so.

276
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:54,985
Well, let's stop talking about the past.
Let's talk about the future.

277
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:57,655
How will you make a living?
You have plans?

278
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,990
You know I've never been
much of a planner.

279
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:03,285
I don't know what I'll do.

280
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:05,204
I knew it.

281
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,998
I'll give you a number later today.

282
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:09,792
- Try calling her.
- Whose number?

283
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,378
The village chief's wife
runs a hair salon.

284
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,213
She's looking to hire an assistant.

285
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:16,757
- That salon is still open?
- Yes.

286
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:19,135
Your old hair salon used to do well.

287
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:22,388
It's only an assistant job,
but go work there.

288
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,890
It's not good for you to be stuck at home.

289
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:26,517
It won't look good to Father.

290
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,019
But that job won't save my face.

291
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:33,566
Thanks.

292
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,359
- I'll go.
- Okay.

293
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:40,448
What are you doing?
Hyeonggeun might get late for school.

294
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:42,408
Jeez, the school.

295
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:44,910
Take your time.

296
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:47,079
I need to go out anyway.
I'll give you a ride.

297
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:48,956
Byeongsoo is coming.

298
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,666
He'll drive me there.

299
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:55,880
Goodness gracious.

300
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:09,643
Sir, you shouldn't park
in the middle of a road.

301
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:11,604
And pick up that cigarette butt.

302
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:12,772
Move your car, please.

303
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:17,818
Are you a thug?

304
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:19,862
Move your car.

305
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:30,122
So what if you glare at me? Scary punk.

306
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:31,290
Gosh, that was scary.

307
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:46,597
I think you're being targeted by my side.

308
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:53,187
Me?

309
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:55,606
Who's after me?

310
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,905
Now, think carefully before you answer.

311
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:06,116
Who took the order?

312
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:09,537
Seokcheol.

313
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,581
Seokcheol?

314
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,167
Are you sure about this?

315
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:17,586
Yes. I heard it myself.

316
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,312
Hey. You have this thing on. Goodness.

317
00:22:35,396 --> 00:22:37,731
Stop. It's for my hair volume.
I'll get it off myself.

318
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:39,108
- Goodness.
- Seokkyung.

319
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,276
Oh.

320
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,360
Hello, ma'am.

321
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,320
- Hi, Byeongsoo.
- Hi.

322
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,700
- Are you going to a funeral?
- Just tell me I look cool.

323
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:50,202
I see you often these days.

324
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:51,704
I must say it's a good thing.

325
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,080
Gosh, it's blinding.

326
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:55,583
How do you keep getting
more beautiful every day?

327
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:57,501
You're being stupid.

328
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:00,379
You're silly. Hurry up.

329
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,006
- Drive her safely.
- Sure, good-bye.

330
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:04,425
We should hurry. What took you so long?

331
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,848
Watch your step.

332
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:21,400
Does Byeongsoo have kimchi at home?

333
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:25,905
Why? You'll make some for him too?

334
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,617
Sharing food is a way
to grow on each other.

335
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,703
Don't. Don't do it.
I won't deliver kimchi anymore.

336
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:37,374
She makes too much kimchi.

337
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:40,502
I'd like to thank
all the parents here

338
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:42,212
who made the time to come today.

339
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:45,341
We'll now begin our open class
for the first semester.

340
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:49,929
All right.
Let's read it out loud together.

341
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:53,098
"Let me introduce my planet to you."

342
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:56,769
"Let me introduce
my planet to you."

343
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:59,313
Good job.

344
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:01,899
- Riel, why don't you go first?
- Okay.

345
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:05,903
Hi, I'm from the Parrot Planet.

346
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:09,406
My mom scolds me for repeating everything.

347
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:11,533
But I enjoy mimicking others.

348
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:13,953
A lot of comedians live here.

349
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:15,746
Good job.

350
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,749
Sion, you're next.

351
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:22,920
I'm from the Soccer Planet.

352
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,255
On this planet, you play soccer all day.

353
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:27,424
You get to choose
the soccer shoes you want.

354
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:29,885
You can go abroad to watch a soccer game.

355
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:32,805
Good job.

356
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:34,306
Hyeonggeun, it's your turn now.

357
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:36,892
I wonder which planet he is from.

358
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:40,479
Good luck.

359
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:52,199
I'm from the Wish Planet.

360
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:54,451
On this planet, your wishes come true.

361
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:57,955
There is a tree here.

362
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:01,166
This tree grants all the wishes you make.

363
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:12,553
My mom ran away from home,
and she actually came back.

364
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:14,722
What?

365
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:17,099
Mom!

366
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:18,183
What?

367
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:20,019
Well...

368
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:21,770
Hello.

369
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:24,857
I'm Hyeonggeun's mom
who once ran away from home.

370
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,692
I hope we get along.

371
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:29,737
Give her a hand.

372
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,989
You...

373
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:38,746
Goodness.

374
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:41,123
She said she once ran away from home?

375
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:42,666
<i>She actually did.</i>

376
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,752
That's so like her.

377
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:46,670
You must be going through a lot.

378
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:48,505
<i>Not at all.</i>

379
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:50,132
Anyway, have a good day.

380
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,300
<i>- Okay, bye.</i>
- Bye.

381
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,098
- Hello.
- Hello.

382
00:26:39,181 --> 00:26:40,891
- Please fold your rear-view mirrors.
- Sure.

383
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:51,902
- Hello?
- <i>Sir.</i>

384
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:54,029
We can attack right now.

385
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,707
Hurry over here!

386
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:09,837
Let's carry it.

387
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:11,880
One, two. Come here.

388
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:13,382
What's your order, sir?

389
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:15,092
CHEONHO

390
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:38,740
<i>We'll take him down</i>
<i>if you say so.</i>

391
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:02,639
<i>Leave him.</i>

392
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:05,392
Wait for now.

393
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,047
<i>You did well.</i>

394
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,507
<i>You did what you had to do to feel better.</i>

395
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:40,802
Those scumbags
had three bowls of <i>yukgaejang</i> each.

396
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:43,931
How many bowls did you have?

397
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:46,892
Not even one.

398
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:48,060
Because you went nuts.

399
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:49,269
You can have some now.

400
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:51,396
You can have four bowls.

401
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:54,441
I won't mind.

402
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:57,152
You're not like those people.

403
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:00,739
Seokcheol.

404
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:04,868
Thanks for being by my side.

405
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:52,082
Hey, Park Seokcheol.

406
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:54,376
Why did you ignore my calls?

407
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:59,840
Why did you? Answer me, punk.

408
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,430
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

409
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:08,015
What is this?

410
00:30:08,098 --> 00:30:10,434
It's written there, letter of resignation.

411
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:12,769
Letter of...

412
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:19,526
I've been in the field for 20 years,
and this has never happened to me before.

413
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:21,153
Take it back.

414
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:22,696
I'm not taking it.

415
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:25,699
Keep it and do whatever you want with it.

416
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:29,578
I'm resigning today.
I'll tell the Chairman myself.

417
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:32,414
You bastard.

418
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:34,332
Are you kidding me?

419
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:35,876
Does it sound like a joke?

420
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:44,593
I've done enough.

421
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:49,014
Take back what you said just now.
Or you'll take the fall.

422
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:51,975
Deal with it quietly.

423
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:55,020
I refuse to get beaten to a pulp
like someone we know.

424
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:03,945
You think that's up to you?

425
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:07,240
If you behave like this,

426
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,619
I won't let you go peacefully.

427
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:18,502
Sir.

428
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:22,631
Please don't.

429
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:25,133
Let me go quietly.

430
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:35,560
I've warned you.

431
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:38,021
MYOUNGSAN INDUSTRIES

432
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,423
<i>Let's have eel.</i>
<i>It's been a while.</i>

433
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:07,259
<i>Here's the address. I'll wait for you.</i>

434
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:09,719
<i>Come to 13 Ohsung 28-gil.</i>

435
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:11,263
SEOKCHEOL

436
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:16,852
<i>I won't say anything unpleasant.</i>
<i>Just come out.</i>

437
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:25,694
PUNGCHEON EEL RESTAURANT

438
00:32:34,244 --> 00:32:37,789
This place is the best
in the neighborhood.

439
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:39,124
You need some healthy food.

440
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:45,130
I just...

441
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,717
wanted a quiet meal...

442
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:52,804
...and I only had you to ask.

443
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:57,309
I called you out to talk about life.

444
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:58,810
Come on.

445
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:02,230
I didn't poison it.

446
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:15,452
Come on. Say something already.

447
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:18,079
You don't like it?
Should we go somewhere else?

448
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:19,247
Let's go.

449
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:21,124
It's good. Let's eat.

450
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:31,259
- Is it good?
- Stop smirking.

451
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:34,763
You and your temper.

452
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:38,058
You haven't changed one bit.

453
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:40,560
You look the same as before too.

454
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:43,647
That goes for you too.

455
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:45,440
You think so?

456
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:48,485
But that's not good, is it?

457
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:51,738
It's okay for you to stay the same,

458
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:52,822
but shouldn't I...

459
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:56,076
change a little to be good?

460
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:58,036
Are you even willing?

461
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:01,873
As if.

462
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:08,171
Maybe a little.

463
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:11,800
Back when we were together,

464
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:13,426
I kind of wanted

465
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:16,137
to be a good person.

466
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:40,537
Taehoon.

467
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:42,872
I've resigned.

468
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:47,085
So you should quit too.

469
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:54,134
Punk, this is my job.

470
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:55,927
If I quit, I can't make a living.

471
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:57,929
I'll stick to this until the end.

472
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:01,141
Being a gangster isn't a job.

473
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:04,102
It's just what you call
someone bad and violent.

474
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,605
It is not your calling.

475
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:09,357
There's nothing at the end of it.
You know that.

476
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:10,525
What about your path?

477
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:12,611
Is it leading anywhere?

478
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:14,779
I don't think so.

479
00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:16,323
Life?

480
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:18,825
It's all pretty much the same.

481
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:25,624
At least people won't call me a thug.

482
00:35:28,585 --> 00:35:30,128
I'll go. Thanks for the food.

483
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:33,173
Come on. Stay and eat some more.

484
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:36,134
Get yourself an eating buddy.

485
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:42,015
Hey, Seokcheol.

486
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,361
Never mind.

487
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:58,114
Take good care of yourself, punk.

488
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:23,556
Did you have a good time?

489
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:27,394
- Bokcheon.
- Yes, sir.

490
00:36:27,477 --> 00:36:29,187
Let's attack Yeoljeong-dong today.

491
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:34,150
Today, sir?

492
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:36,069
Yes, today.

493
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:38,279
Why? Can't we?

494
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,365
No, it's just...

495
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,617
We need to check where they would be.

496
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:43,743
Changsoo's boys?

497
00:36:44,494 --> 00:36:46,329
They'll probably be at the nightclub.

498
00:36:46,955 --> 00:36:49,791
There's this guy named Younggi.
Today's his birthday.

499
00:36:51,501 --> 00:36:53,503
Let them drink and have fun.

500
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,547
Then finish them all at once.

501
00:36:57,757 --> 00:36:58,758
Yes, sir.

502
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:16,901
Fortunately,
the tumor hasn't grown.

503
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:19,612
How's your headache?

504
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:22,323
It's still there. I feel dizzy too.

505
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:26,119
You need surgery.

506
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:28,163
The tumor is at a tricky location,

507
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:32,125
but it's better
to have it reduced at least.

508
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:35,920
Chemotherapy has improved,
it's become more effective these days.

509
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:37,005
Doctor,

510
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:41,009
I said no to the operation.
Just give me strong medicine.

511
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:44,012
I won't have my head opened

512
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:47,265
just for this tumor
that can't even be removed completely.

513
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:52,103
Welcome, sir!

514
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:53,688
Welcome, sir!

515
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:56,649
Hello.

516
00:38:37,357 --> 00:38:38,608
Come in.

517
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:46,574
May I have a moment with you?

518
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:49,494
What, you punk?

519
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:53,081
What's this all of a sudden?
Why would Seokcheol resign?

520
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,165
I apologize.

521
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:58,211
I kept telling him not to quit,
but he wouldn't listen.

522
00:38:58,795 --> 00:39:01,965
Look, Oh Sangyeol.
I told you to keep him under control.

523
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,049
Just...

524
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:07,679
Just what is the problem
with you?

525
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,180
Mr. Chairman,

526
00:39:09,264 --> 00:39:12,934
I talked to him enough.
But he just wouldn't listen.

527
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:18,481
I don't think we can change his mind.

528
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:21,901
It's time to settle.

529
00:39:23,403 --> 00:39:25,738
Settle? Settle what?

530
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:29,325
I will teach him a hard lesson
from my end.

531
00:39:32,287 --> 00:39:33,288
Don't.

532
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:35,039
Who knows?

533
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:37,041
He might've said he'd quit
to work with Taehoon.

534
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:40,295
You know they're close friends.

535
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:42,171
It can happen.

536
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:47,594
Leave it up to me.

537
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:50,346
I'll settle it nice and clean.

538
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:13,077
<i>Hi, Hyeonggeun's mom</i>
<i>who once ran away from home.</i>

539
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:14,579
<i>Did you get home safely?</i>

540
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,375
Jeez, those punks.

541
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:20,627
- Sir.
- What?

542
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:25,757
There must be
no mistakes today.

543
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,425
Carry light weapons.

544
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:29,636
And take the rest of the boys...

545
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:31,471
Sorry.

546
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:33,264
- Keep talking.
- Goodness.

547
00:40:34,307 --> 00:40:35,642
Am I not supposed to hear?

548
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:38,144
It's nothing serious, sir.

549
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:39,562
"Sir"?

550
00:40:40,313 --> 00:40:41,981
Call me detective.

551
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:45,109
What are you all doing here
in broad daylight, causing tension?

552
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:46,653
Tension?

553
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:48,947
I'm just taking them to a sauna.

554
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:51,366
Go to a sauna individually.
Not as a group.

555
00:40:51,741 --> 00:40:52,867
Dismissed.

556
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:54,494
Dismissed!

557
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,287
Disperse.

558
00:40:56,788 --> 00:40:58,873
Move quickly, you damn punks.

559
00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:11,636
Hello.

560
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:15,181
- Hello.
- Hello.

561
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:21,062
- Oh.
- Hello.

562
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:22,563
Where's my mom?

563
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:25,400
- Something good is going on with her.
- Excuse me?

564
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:28,152
She's moving to a single room today.
Didn't you know?

565
00:41:50,967 --> 00:41:52,468
I found you, Mom.

566
00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:54,554
It's nice.

567
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:58,016
And quiet.

568
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:03,062
Right.

569
00:42:03,146 --> 00:42:05,982
It's nice and quiet.

570
00:42:06,816 --> 00:42:07,817
You came.

571
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:12,321
What are you doing here?

572
00:42:13,823 --> 00:42:15,116
Well...

573
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:17,744
Your mother was craving strawberry milk.

574
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:24,876
I just thought I'd drop by,
and I saw her sharing a room with others.

575
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:26,502
I thought it'd be uncomfortable.

576
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:29,756
I'm going to pay for this,
just so you know.

577
00:42:31,174 --> 00:42:33,634
Ma'am. Strawberry milk, right?

578
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:36,304
Don't change your mind
and say banana milk now.

579
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:42,477
Mom, this isn't your room. Let's go.

580
00:42:43,603 --> 00:42:44,979
Let's go back to your room.

581
00:42:46,189 --> 00:42:47,231
Let's go.

582
00:42:47,315 --> 00:42:50,068
Can't you at least accept
what I do for your mother?

583
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:51,903
She's your only family.

584
00:42:56,449 --> 00:42:58,493
What do you think you're doing?

585
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,244
I can take care of my mom myself.

586
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:02,538
Stop crossing the line.

587
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:06,584
There was a girl named Seoyeon.

588
00:43:07,502 --> 00:43:11,547
She was 25 years old.
Her dream was to be a painter.

589
00:43:12,882 --> 00:43:15,259
I don't know much about talent,

590
00:43:16,177 --> 00:43:18,513
but she had been good at drawing
since she was little.

591
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,147
Jeez.

592
00:43:29,524 --> 00:43:32,735
It's really not easy to be a model.

593
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:35,404
Taehoon, can't you do this much
for your sister?

594
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:37,740
I can.

595
00:43:37,824 --> 00:43:39,033
- I must.
- Right.

596
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:40,785
- Of course I can.
- Right.

597
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:44,163
Are you not done yet?

598
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:46,791
I'm almost done, Mr. Model.

599
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:51,254
Will you please soften your expression?

600
00:43:56,259 --> 00:43:57,510
Yes. Good.

601
00:43:58,261 --> 00:44:01,139
Hey. Smile like that more often.

602
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:06,435
I want you to live a good life,
just like your smile now.

603
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:09,981
- Seoyeon.
- What?

604
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:13,484
I want to pee.

605
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:16,028
Oh, please.

606
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:21,159
What's wrong?

607
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:24,495
- Are you okay?
- I'm good.

608
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:26,956
All right, smile.

609
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:29,542
Come on.

610
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:33,254
But she's gone.

611
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,841
She didn't even
get to make her dream come true.

612
00:44:38,259 --> 00:44:41,721
All she did was struggle because she had
a poor, hopeless thug for a brother.

613
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:45,892
I didn't realize it until she died

614
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:49,604
that I didn't just lose my sister

615
00:44:50,271 --> 00:44:51,272
but my one...

616
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:54,775
and only family.

617
00:44:56,194 --> 00:44:58,863
If someone had offered help at that time,

618
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,407
I wouldn't have thought twice.

619
00:45:02,617 --> 00:45:04,035
Whoever it may have been,

620
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,078
I would've taken that offer.

621
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,100
Are you okay?

622
00:46:21,988 --> 00:46:24,115
I haven't seen Seokhee around for a while.

623
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:25,700
Oh, she stepped outside briefly.

624
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:26,993
Where?

625
00:46:27,076 --> 00:46:28,119
That, I'm not sure.

626
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:30,871
- She just said she was off to consult...
- Consult?

627
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:34,625
I see.

628
00:46:44,677 --> 00:46:46,721
You're in your fifth year
of training.

629
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:48,973
You have enough graduate school credits.

630
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:50,850
Did you pass the NCLEX?

631
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:52,560
I'm studying for it.

632
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:55,563
And I'd like to be
a doctor of nursing practice

633
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:59,817
who can make diagnoses and prescriptions
like doctors, not an RN.

634
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,111
So your goal is to get a DNP degree.

635
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:05,364
That's great.
I mean, it's the highest nursing course.

636
00:47:05,448 --> 00:47:08,492
I've searched, and there's this college
that has a joint degree program.

637
00:47:08,576 --> 00:47:09,994
You found everything in advance.

638
00:47:10,745 --> 00:47:13,497
College, tuition, and visa...

639
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:18,753
Since you're thinking of a DNP degree,
you have emigrating in mind, right?

640
00:47:32,892 --> 00:47:35,144
I finally found you.

641
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:37,938
How did you know I was here?

642
00:47:38,022 --> 00:47:41,692
I didn't know. I looked everywhere for you
from the first floor.

643
00:47:41,776 --> 00:47:43,986
I heard you went for a consultation.

644
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:46,197
It's a secret.

645
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,032
A secret?

646
00:47:49,158 --> 00:47:51,202
A secret. I have a secret too.

647
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:52,787
Want me to tell you?

648
00:47:53,496 --> 00:47:55,456
I think I'll be promoted...

649
00:47:58,042 --> 00:47:59,502
to be an associate professor.

650
00:48:03,381 --> 00:48:04,382
Isn't that insane?

651
00:48:04,465 --> 00:48:06,801
You're surprised, right? Honestly, right?

652
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:08,928
This is crazy. So...

653
00:48:09,512 --> 00:48:10,513
Well...

654
00:48:12,056 --> 00:48:13,849
If I become an associate professor,

655
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:17,186
I'll be the youngest person ever
to get this promotion in this hospital.

656
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:18,854
Isn't that crazy?

657
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:21,607
You know Dr. Hong Jonghoon, the internist?

658
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:25,027
His face turned so red
after hearing the news

659
00:48:25,111 --> 00:48:27,905
and he took it out on his juniors.

660
00:48:33,369 --> 00:48:35,371
- Kihong.
- What?

661
00:48:36,956 --> 00:48:38,040
Do you love me?

662
00:48:39,375 --> 00:48:42,420
What a useless question.
Of course I do.

663
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:44,171
Then tell me.

664
00:48:44,964 --> 00:48:45,965
I love you.

665
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:52,763
I love you. I...

666
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:55,224
I...

667
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:57,852
My life is boring without you.

668
00:48:57,935 --> 00:48:59,562
It's meaningless and empty.

669
00:49:00,271 --> 00:49:01,689
I'll feel too empty to live.

670
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:06,026
I see.

671
00:49:08,446 --> 00:49:10,489
But you seem...

672
00:49:12,408 --> 00:49:15,703
more interested in yourself than me.

673
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:17,621
Well, I understand.

674
00:49:17,705 --> 00:49:20,708
Everyone is self-centered.

675
00:49:25,713 --> 00:49:28,549
I went to consult someone
about studying abroad.

676
00:49:29,592 --> 00:49:32,261
- What?
- Studying abroad, in the States.

677
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:35,431
I've been preparing it
for five years to go with you.

678
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:37,433
I went to consult about it today.

679
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:40,853
You'll study abroad for real?

680
00:49:42,897 --> 00:49:45,566
- It's 60 to 40.
- What's 60?

681
00:49:47,485 --> 00:49:48,652
It's a secret.

682
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:50,863
Seokhee.

683
00:49:53,449 --> 00:49:54,450
Seokhee.

684
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:06,462
New apartments in
this neighborhood are beyond your budget.

685
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:09,340
This one is old but clean.

686
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:11,050
I see.

687
00:50:17,348 --> 00:50:18,474
This way, please.

688
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:20,184
Oh, I'm coming.

689
00:50:32,238 --> 00:50:33,364
Goodness.

690
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:41,038
Oh, boy.

691
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:44,542
You're a family of four, right?

692
00:50:45,251 --> 00:50:49,505
Well, five
including my 7-year-old grandson.

693
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:51,840
Goodness. Five including a kid.

694
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:56,387
This place might be a bit too small then.
You need a place with one more room.

695
00:50:58,347 --> 00:51:01,725
Well, I can have my son move out.

696
00:51:01,809 --> 00:51:03,602
It will be four people then.

697
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:05,437
I see.

698
00:51:39,138 --> 00:51:41,015
Good job, my son.

699
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:42,516
There you go.

700
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,476
Be handsome.

701
00:51:45,269 --> 00:51:47,104
Your neck too.

702
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:49,148
Why bother washing him?

703
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:51,734
He's going to get himself
covered in dirt again anyway.

704
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:53,319
Blow your nose.

705
00:51:53,402 --> 00:51:57,740
Let me see.
Wow, you look so handsome now.

706
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:03,537
- Ahhh!
- Goodness.

707
00:52:03,621 --> 00:52:04,955
Son, are you okay?

708
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:06,457
He's okay.

709
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,250
He gets up as if nothing happened.

710
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:12,171
But I washed him just now.

711
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:15,966
Hyeonggeun, be careful
not to dirty your clothes.

712
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:19,803
Leave him be.

713
00:52:19,887 --> 00:52:21,013
Just keep doing this.

714
00:52:21,722 --> 00:52:24,642
I'd like some rest. My back hurts.

715
00:52:24,725 --> 00:52:26,602
Rest already? You just started!

716
00:52:27,186 --> 00:52:28,270
Sit down.

717
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:36,445
Did Father go somewhere?

718
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:40,908
- He went to check out some apartments.
- Apartments?

719
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:44,745
Yes, to find a place to move in
after selling this house.

720
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:45,829
Happy now?

721
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,207
Pull the rest out before coming in.

722
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:52,336
- Mom.
- Oh, hey.

723
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:53,962
What the... Seokhee.

724
00:52:54,046 --> 00:52:57,257
- You'll sleep over here today?
- Yes, I have a lot on my mind.

725
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:00,260
Why?

726
00:53:01,762 --> 00:53:04,223
I just have a lot on my mind.
Don't ask more.

727
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:06,141
You won't know even if I tell you.

728
00:53:06,225 --> 00:53:10,145
I will. I'll know if you tell me.
You're giving me that frown again?

729
00:53:10,229 --> 00:53:12,564
What's troubling you? Tell me.

730
00:53:16,819 --> 00:53:19,697
- What? A nurse in the States?
- Yes.

731
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:23,242
You can be a nurse in Korea.
Why go all the way to the States?

732
00:53:26,245 --> 00:53:27,413
There's no future here.

733
00:53:27,496 --> 00:53:29,039
Why do you say so?

734
00:53:29,123 --> 00:53:32,334
You can work here and marry Kihong.

735
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:36,588
Mom, marrying Kihong
isn't why I became a nurse.

736
00:53:37,965 --> 00:53:40,134
And it doesn't mean I won't marry him.

737
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:43,762
I'm saying I value myself
more than this marriage.

738
00:53:43,846 --> 00:53:46,014
What are you talking about?

739
00:53:46,098 --> 00:53:49,059
You don't know what's happening
to our family. Don't be immature.

740
00:53:49,143 --> 00:53:50,644
Immature?

741
00:53:50,728 --> 00:53:54,398
I send you 500,000 won every month.
I pay for your utility bills.

742
00:53:56,275 --> 00:53:59,027
- Even the utility bills?
- Yes.

743
00:53:59,111 --> 00:54:01,488
It was frustrating
to see her go to the bank herself.

744
00:54:01,572 --> 00:54:02,656
I do it online for her.

745
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:04,158
So Seokhee is doing enough.

746
00:54:05,117 --> 00:54:06,326
Don't be so hard on her.

747
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:10,914
You're not in a place to side with her.
This is all your fault.

748
00:54:10,998 --> 00:54:12,708
Don't hit me with the radish greens. Tsk!

749
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:17,671
Anyway, I'll leave for the States
as soon as I'm ready.

750
00:54:21,842 --> 00:54:24,720
Working there guarantees
a much higher salary.

751
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:28,015
I'll send you two million won each month,
so don't worry.

752
00:54:29,183 --> 00:54:31,143
This is not about money, brat.

753
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:34,313
I'll be too frustrated
to live without you.

754
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:39,067
When your brother became a gangster
and this brat was crazy about gambling,

755
00:54:39,151 --> 00:54:40,778
you were my only joy in life.

756
00:54:43,155 --> 00:54:44,198
Don't go.

757
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:50,954
I really want to go.

758
00:55:00,214 --> 00:55:01,423
Then save it for later.

759
00:55:01,507 --> 00:55:04,343
Once we settle the house issue, go then.

760
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:07,763
The house issue? What house issue?

761
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:10,724
Your father wants to sell this house.

762
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:11,808
Why?

763
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:19,191
Oh, man.

764
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:30,410
This house

765
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:33,413
is about to be auctioned.

766
00:55:34,248 --> 00:55:36,333
What are you talking about?

767
00:55:39,503 --> 00:55:40,629
Tell me!

768
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:45,342
I borrowed some money
using this house as collateral

769
00:55:46,385 --> 00:55:48,470
when I ran away from home.

770
00:55:48,971 --> 00:55:49,972
How much?

771
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:54,685
- Three.
- Three?

772
00:55:56,395 --> 00:55:57,396
Yes, three.

773
00:55:57,479 --> 00:55:59,856
It has to be 30 million won.
30 million, right?

774
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:02,401
Not that.

775
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:04,611
Including the interest,

776
00:56:05,696 --> 00:56:08,115
it's 300 million.

777
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:09,283
300 million?

778
00:56:12,661 --> 00:56:15,038
You're out of your mind. Hey!

779
00:56:15,122 --> 00:56:16,415
- You little...
- Goodness.

780
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:19,042
- You're crazy!
- It wasn't intentional!

781
00:56:19,126 --> 00:56:21,295
- 300 million?
- No!

782
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:23,130
- 300 million?
- I'm sorry.

783
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:53,118
SEOKHEE

784
00:57:03,879 --> 00:57:05,339
What are you doing there?

785
00:57:06,214 --> 00:57:08,050
- Dad, you're back.
- Yeah.

786
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:09,509
Shouldn't you be at work?

787
00:57:09,593 --> 00:57:10,802
I left work early today.

788
00:57:10,886 --> 00:57:11,887
That's good.

789
00:57:12,596 --> 00:57:15,515
I bought some fried chicken on my way.
Let's eat. Come in.

790
00:57:20,479 --> 00:57:21,980
Did something happen?

791
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:24,399
No.

792
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:26,735
Come on in. Come.

793
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:32,449
Dad.

794
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:34,951
What are you doing?
You're a grown-up woman.

795
00:57:39,748 --> 00:57:40,749
The trees

796
00:57:41,917 --> 00:57:43,418
are growing well again this year.

797
00:57:52,177 --> 00:57:54,262
You must be going through a lot.

798
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:19,079
ILHAE

799
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:26,128
Hey.

800
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:29,715
Sangyeol, wait outside.

801
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:34,344
Yes, sir.

802
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:42,602
Sit.

803
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:58,285
So you want to resign?

804
00:59:01,163 --> 00:59:02,164
Yes.

805
00:59:03,331 --> 00:59:04,708
I've made up my mind.

806
00:59:05,876 --> 00:59:07,002
Please accept it, sir.

807
00:59:16,303 --> 00:59:17,554
Must you leave?

808
00:59:19,306 --> 00:59:20,348
Yes.

809
00:59:21,183 --> 00:59:23,226
If you leave, I'll have

810
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:25,729
no one else to trust.

811
00:59:27,898 --> 00:59:31,401
Sangyeol has much experience.
I'm sure he'll manage well.

812
00:59:32,861 --> 00:59:33,862
Seokcheol.

813
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:39,743
Sangyeol isn't capable.

814
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:41,953
He lacks skills and brains.

815
00:59:42,037 --> 00:59:45,248
He always gets ahead of himself.
He never does anything right.

816
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:50,170
Seokcheol,

817
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:52,506
I've always thought

818
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:55,801
that you were number two in this gang,

819
00:59:56,551 --> 00:59:57,552
not Sangyeol.

820
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:09,439
I'll be honest with you.

821
01:00:09,523 --> 01:00:10,982
I'm aged.

822
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:13,735
Mentally and physically,
I'm not like before.

823
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:16,822
I'm planning to step down and retire soon.

824
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:21,117
When I do,
I want you to take over the company.
