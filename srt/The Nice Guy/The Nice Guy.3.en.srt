00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:42,960
The Nice Guy

2
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,254
THIS DRAMA SERIES IS FICTIONAL,
AND THE PERSONS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,

3
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:46,547
SETTINGS AND EVENTS DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
SERIES HAVE BEEN FICTIONALLY CREATED

4
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:47,714
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN SAFE CONDITIONS

5
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:49,091
WITH THE CONSENT OF
AND IN THE PRESENCE OF GUARDIANS

6
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:53,053
It's my business, too.

7
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:57,808
Who do you think will have to pay back
the money you borrow from him?

8
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,185
You know how hard I'll have to work
to make up for it.

9
00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:02,187
- You ungrateful--
- It's because of you...

10
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:07,234
that I got into this line of work.

11
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:22,291
Sir.

12
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:24,293
Sir?

13
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:25,460
Oh, yes.

14
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:26,545
Right.

15
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:29,298
So, what did you want to see me about?

16
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:32,134
Oh, well...

17
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:37,055
I came downtown for some business
and decided to stop by and see you.

18
00:01:37,139 --> 00:01:38,140
I see.

19
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,393
Is there something you wanted to tell me?

20
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,146
Well...

21
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:48,025
Take good care of Seokcheol.

22
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:51,153
Don't shove him around too much, okay?

23
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:52,237
Sure.

24
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:54,865
I'll get going then.

25
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:55,949
Sir, wait a minute.

26
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:03,457
You could get yourself a new suit,
and take Daegi out for a meal sometime.

27
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,292
No, take it back. I'm good. Bye.

28
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,502
- Wait, sir.
- No, no. I'm leaving.

29
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:08,754
- Wait!
- No, thanks. Bye.

30
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:10,714
Sir!

31
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:11,798
Sir...

32
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:51,880
Are you finding it difficult to send money
to my family every month?

33
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:54,800
No, sir. I'm only keeping my promise.

34
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:58,553
I'll probably be sentenced
to at least 10 years in prison.

35
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,306
You know my son, right?

36
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,974
You mean, Seokcheol?

37
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:05,894
Give him a job at your company.

38
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:10,649
The money you send to my house
can be considered as his salary.

39
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,025
Does that work for you?

40
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,861
Welcome back.

41
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:04,536
This isn't yours. It's mine.

42
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,334
How carefree of you,

43
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,503
worrying about skincare
at a time like this.

44
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:16,548
Must be nice, huh?

45
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,009
Why are you drunk?

46
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,137
That's none of your business.

47
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:23,972
You know,

48
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:28,685
during the past five years
of my life as a nurse,

49
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:32,647
I've often wondered
why my life is the way it is.

50
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:34,483
Why do I...

51
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:39,237
Why do I always have problems
like a patient in emergency care?

52
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:41,823
What are you talking about?

53
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,451
Well, the thing is...

54
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,369
Today...

55
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,749
I got my heart broken.

56
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:53,668
Hold on.

57
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:55,712
Did something happen?

58
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:01,051
Dr. Jang,
do you have a girlfriend?

59
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:06,139
- Do you?
- Uh...

60
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:07,808
Yes, well...

61
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:11,186
I don't.

62
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,564
That guy is ridiculous.

63
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:19,528
So, he wants to go to a piano concert
with that hospital director's daughter?

64
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,697
He was crazy about you
when he was younger.

65
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:24,533
He's too good for you
now that he's a doctor?

66
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:29,454
Honestly speaking, if our family
had supported you in your studies,

67
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:30,831
you wouldn't be a nurse.

68
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:32,499
You would've easily become a doctor.

69
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,710
Are you looking down on my job?

70
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:37,838
No, that's not what I'm saying.

71
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:41,883
Hey, you should be grateful
to have me side with you.

72
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:43,718
I never asked you to side with me.

73
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:47,472
If you care about me so much,
why are you still staying in my house?

74
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,808
You should find a way to move on.

75
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:02,362
Where are you going?

76
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,030
To bed.

77
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:10,245
- Oh, sorry, I'll take them off.
- Don't.

78
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:12,455
You can keep them on.

SEOKCHEOL

83
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:56,458
- Hi. Where are you?
- <i>At home.</i>

84
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,628
<i>- Just thought I'd call and say hi.</i>

85
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:01,463
I'm going to try auditioning again.

86
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:02,756
<i>Really?</i>

87
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,799
Yes, I'm going to give it another try.

88
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,844
This time,
it'll be at a jazz bar in Myoungsan City.

89
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,262
I went and checked it out.

90
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:11,264
It has a nice vibe, and they pay well.

91
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:15,769
I haven't decided on what song I'll sing
for the audition.

92
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:18,104
- Will you listen and help me pick one?
<i>- Sure.</i>

93
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,857
<i>- Go ahead.</i>
- Hang on a second.

94
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:29,324
All right, this is number one.

The Nice Guy

101
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,391
Jeez!

102
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,935
You startled me. What are you doing here?

103
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:41,813
Seokcheol didn't come home last night.

104
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:44,065
He didn't tell me he'd be staying out.

105
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:45,316
Did he tell you?

106
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,526
No.

107
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,571
It's not like him to do that.

108
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,281
Did you try calling him?

109
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:54,951
There's no need. He's a grown-up.

110
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,258
Yes, I had to work late,
so I slept at a sauna last night.

111
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,926
<i>Oh, I see.</i>

112
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,054
You could've at least left us a text.

113
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:15,889
I'll do that next time.

114
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:17,891
Rest up. I'm on my way to work now.

115
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,142
<i>I see. Bye.</i>

116
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,268
<i>Wait, Seokcheol.</i>

117
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:21,936
What?

118
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,855
Any news about Seokkyung yet?

119
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,192
Well...

120
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:30,653
I think we're getting close.

121
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,072
We'll find her soon.

122
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,950
I dreamt about her last night.

123
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:41,998
<i>That brat was alone in the kitchen,</i>
<i>eating kimchi with her hands.</i>

124
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:46,086
I told her it'd be too salty on its own,
and handed her a bowl of steamed rice.

125
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:48,505
Then she was gone.

126
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:52,759
<i>Goodness.</i>
<i>I hope she's not skipping any meals.</i>

127
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,135
She won't be, Mom.

128
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:56,971
I bet she's well-fed,
and sleeps just fine. Don't worry.

129
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:00,350
You're right.
She does what she wants in life.

130
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,893
She won't starve to death.

131
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,686
<i>- Bye.</i>
- Bye.

132
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:07,899
Damn it...

133
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:11,402
Grandma!

134
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:13,238
Let's go to the playground.

135
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:14,614
Let's play on the slide.

136
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:17,534
Goodness, again? We did that yesterday.

137
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,203
Come on, Grandma. I want to go.

138
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,347
I heard your father visited yesterday.

139
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,432
Yes. Who told you?

140
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:43,434
The Chairman.

141
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:47,564
Didn't he say anything else about it?

142
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:49,357
Like what?

143
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:51,359
Like, what they spoke about.

144
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,778
Oh.

145
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:56,447
He said your father
just stopped by for a bit.

146
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,243
That's it? Did he say anything else?

147
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:02,537
No... Oh, right.

148
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:06,291
The Chairman asked me to give this to you.

149
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:08,793
What is it?

150
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:12,589
He meant to give it to your father
so he could buy some new clothes,

151
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,465
but he declined it and left.

152
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:23,016
Well, if my father didn't take it,
I won't either.

153
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,101
- You can keep it.
- What are you...

154
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:27,478
Fine, I'll take it.

155
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,899
Don't ask again.
And hide it before I change my mind.

156
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:32,192
Okay, thank you.

157
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:33,359
No takebacks.

158
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:43,494
That's good. Drink it up
if it makes you feel better.

159
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:52,295
Seokcheol went through a lot
while you were in prison.

160
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:54,297
At such a young age, too.

161
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:58,551
Seeing his face yesterday

162
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:00,553
reminded me of the past.

163
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:05,350
Once, when he was in elementary school,
I visited his school.

164
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,686
I was all dressed up,

165
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,898
but he wouldn't even look at me.

166
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,775
Really?

167
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:16,569
I wondered what was wrong with him.

168
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:23,701
Then suddenly, with a long face,
he pushed me and told me to go home.

169
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:30,083
He knew what his father did for a living.

170
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:32,460
He was only a child,

171
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,880
and I wronged him in so many ways.

172
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:41,261
Goodness. You're not as strong
as you used to be.

173
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:47,016
Listen, just sit down with Seokcheol
and tell him how you feel.

174
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,353
I'm sure he'll understand
if you explained things to him.

175
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:52,814
I'd be a fool...

176
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,653
to expect him to understand me.

177
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,116
Goodness.

178
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:07,287


179
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:18,464
SIS FROM HOUSE

180
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,307
Oh, I can't help it.

181
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:08,097
Look at me.

182
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:11,267
Gosh, what is this?

183
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:16,022
Hyeonggeun.

184
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,444
Aren't you tired?

185
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,905
- Mom...
- Good. Gosh. Go on.

186
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:29,035
Go up. Go up.

187
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:35,249
One last time, then let's go home, okay?
I'm tired.

188
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:37,960
What is it?

189
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,545
Hyeonggeun.

190
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:41,756
Hyeonggeun, come down.

191
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,591
Come down. Let's go home. Good boy.

192
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:47,178
Goodness.

193
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:48,763
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

194
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:53,768
- Did you have fun?
- Yes.

195
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:58,272
Let's go home and eat something yummy.
What should we have?

196
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:00,191
- Jjajangmyeon?
- Jjajangmyeon?

197
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:02,652
All right. Jjajangmyeon, it is.

198
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:06,823
Let's see,
if we want to make jjajangmyeon...

199
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:11,202
Mom?

200
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:29,178
Hyeonggeun, where are you going? Stop.

201
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:31,848
Hey, where are you going?

202
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,182
- Oh, no.
- Jeez.

203
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,314
Gosh, that brat.

204
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:48,739
Wait. Slow down, dear.
You don't want to trip and fall.

205
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:49,824
Goodness.

206
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,543
Mom!

207
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:02,545
Mom!

208
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:14,473
Oh, no! Hyeonggeun!

209
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:44,545
Wait. He shouldn't go that way.

210
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,798
Jeez, where did Mom go?

211
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:49,175
Hyeonggeun!

212
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,969
Gosh, where is he? Hyeonggeun!

213
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:53,888
Hyeonggeun. Oh, no.

214
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:57,141
No, Hyeonggeun. No.

215
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:04,023
Hyeonggeun!

216
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:08,319
Mommy?

217
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,155
- Huh?
- You're my mom, aren't you?

218
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,241
What?

219
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:18,204
No. I'm not your mom.

220
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,915
Then, how do you know my name?

221
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,127
No, Hyeonggeun. No.

222
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:26,963
No, you're right.

223
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,884
You're right. It's your mom.

224
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:34,804
So, don't cry. Stop crying.

225
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,932
I knew it was you.

226
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,350
Yes, it's me.

227
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:42,228
Hyeonggeun,

228
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:44,730
promise me something.

229
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:49,610
Don't tell your grandma
that you met me here.

230
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:50,778
- Okay?
- Why?

231
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,155
Because...

232
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:56,450
Is it because you're afraid
Grandpa will beat you up?

233
00:17:57,076 --> 00:18:00,329
Yes, he'll beat me up.

234
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:05,418
So, you need to protect me, okay?

235
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:08,421
Will you keep our little secret, hmm?

236
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:12,592
I'll come back to see you for sure.

237
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:15,469
I promise.

238
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,023
Hurry to your grandma.

239
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:28,774
Okay?

240
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,484
There. Hurry on.

241
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:32,653
Go.

242
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:34,989
Hurry.

243
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:37,742
Go.

244
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:43,247
Hyeonggeun! Goodness.

245
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:46,167
Gosh, where have you been?

246
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,045
I thought I lost you.

247
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,297
Let's hurry home. Gosh.

248
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:56,844
Come on.

249
00:18:58,804 --> 00:18:59,889
- It's spring now.
- Yes.

250
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,733
I hope the construction
resumes soon.

251
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:14,028
- Do you have the contract?
- Yes, of course.

252
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:16,489
I'm going to keep it safe with me.

253
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,575
It's a draft, so make sure you read it

254
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:22,745
and negotiate a few things in person
with my boss.

255
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,456
Sure, I'll have it done right away.

256
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:30,294
You know, I feel reassured
every time I see Mr. Seokcheol.

257
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:31,545
Thank you.

258
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:35,424
I hope you're aware that
he's the one who made this deal possible.

259
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:38,427
Of course we are.
He's the trump card of our company.

260
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:40,471
I'm reassured to have him too.

261
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:43,432
Oh, right.
We'll take a look around the site, sir.

262
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:44,642
Why don't you go in?

263
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:47,144
- Sure. Take your time.
- Okay.

264
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:52,108
- Good-bye, sir.
- Good-bye.

265
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:55,403
Seokcheol.

266
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,655
You've done a great job.

267
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:02,118
If the Chairman settles the contract
with them today,

268
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:03,911
we're going out for drinks.

269
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:07,998
Looking at the scale here,

270
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:11,502
the profit is gonna be much bigger
than with the District Three deal.

271
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:14,296
Come on, you can't compare the two.

272
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:18,551
But, yes, this will be three times
more profitable than District Three.

273
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,137
In that case,

274
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,766
could I get an advance,
considering what I did?

275
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:29,395
Don't tell me you'll quit
after taking the money.

276
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:32,273
I'll make sure my work here is done,
don't worry.

277
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:35,067
So, how much do you need?

278
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,280
It's a big amount.

279
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:41,407
How big? 10 million won?

280
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:43,492
About...

281
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,495
Jeez! 100 million won.

282
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:49,999
That much?

283
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:55,296
That's a little too much.

284
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:58,466
I don't know
how to bring it up with the Chairman.

285
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:02,845
Anyway, why do you suddenly need
that much money?

286
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,307
I have my reasons.

287
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,977
Besides, I've never asked you
for anything before.

288
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:13,564
Gosh, that punk.

289
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,108
What a nuisance.

290
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:17,693
100 million won.

291
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:19,904
Jeez, that's a big amount.

292
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,115
MYOUNGSAN HOSPITAL

293
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:25,826
Well, nothing is too serious.
Just a simple sprain.

294
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:28,746
I'll prescribe meds for three days.
Make sure you don't skip any.

295
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:30,790
- And don't exert yourself.
- I see.

296
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,374
Give her an injection.

297
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,959
- Yes.
- Thank you, Doctor.

298
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:35,503
- This way, please.
- Okay.

299
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:37,963
Ms. Seokhee.

300
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:39,715
Can we talk for a moment?

301
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:46,597
What is it?

302
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:48,432
Seokhee.

303
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:52,520
Please don't misunderstand me.

304
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:55,898
What would I do with her daughter
when I already have you?

305
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,526
Date her or something?

306
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:02,071
She brought her daughter over yesterday

307
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:05,533
and asked me right to my face,
so I couldn't flat-out say no.

308
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,662
And that piano concert... Listen.

309
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:11,956
I'm not going.

310
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:15,292
I told her that
I forgot I had a conference to attend

311
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:16,794
and that I couldn't make it.

312
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:21,090
Did you have to make an excuse like that?

313
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:24,844
Come on, you know what she's like.
You wouldn't want to get on her bad side.

314
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:27,596
Remember what happened the other day
with Dr. Jang Jonghoon?

315
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,933
She sent him off to another hospital
because he didn't greet her.

316
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:34,103
I don't want to be separated from you.

317
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:35,604
Hmm?

318
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,690
Come on.

319
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:41,610
Let's go out for a nice meal later,
what do you say?

320
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:43,279
Hmm?

321
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,366
You can go alone.

322
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:49,493
Seokhee.

323
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:54,248
Goodness.

324
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:56,834
Gosh.

325
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:08,512
Next is...

326
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,891
Great! Lucky me.

327
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:14,727
Nice!

328
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:17,187
You shouldn't play cards here.

329
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,316
What are you doing? Give them back.

330
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:23,235
I'm confiscating them.
Do it after you're discharged.

331
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:24,820
I'm not leaving.

332
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:28,449
My life's in danger. I can't even go home.

333
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:30,910
No one has that much time to kill.

334
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:33,412
House Jang thinks
she lost your sister because of me.

335
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:34,872
She wants me to pay the price.

336
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:36,957
They're looking for me!

337
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:39,752
So what? You can't live here forever.

338
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,629
You and your brother
got me into this mess.

339
00:23:41,712 --> 00:23:43,964
How shameless of you.

340
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:47,217
Hey, give me the cards.

341
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:48,344
No, I don't want to.

342
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:49,678
That little...

343
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:53,140
Damn it.

344
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:54,391
This is annoying.

345
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:32,262
Do I have high blood pressure?

346
00:24:32,346 --> 00:24:33,555
No, it's normal.

347
00:24:43,691 --> 00:24:45,651
Have you rested enough?

348
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:46,860
Yes.

349
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:49,989
I see. Did you have nightmares?

350
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,157
No... I mean, yes...

351
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:57,621
You know, we went through
every hospital in this neighborhood

352
00:24:57,705 --> 00:24:58,914
just to find you.

353
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:04,128
I know you.
You're that lady from the gambling house.

354
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:06,964
- Remember me?
- I do.

355
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:11,385
You left your car with me
during the last Chuseok and got it back.

356
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:12,886
You have a good memory.

357
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:18,892
These boys are here
to help you get discharged.

358
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:20,936
I'm not supposed to get discharged today.

359
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:24,898
I know. But you have to get discharged.

360
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:27,484
- Hey, Halibut.
- Yes, sir.

361
00:25:27,568 --> 00:25:29,778
- Let's help her pack up and leave.
- Yes, sir.

362
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:31,155
Move aside, please.

363
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:33,073
What are you doing?

364
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:36,118
She can't just leave
without the doctor's permission.

365
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,786
What are you talking about?

366
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,955
The patient wants to leave

367
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:42,750
due to her delicate family situation.

368
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:45,127
But I need more treatment.

369
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,712
Shut it, you wench.

370
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:49,506
You're going to help me find Seokkyung.

371
00:25:51,592 --> 00:25:53,719
Oh, were you checking your blood pressure?

372
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:55,596
How nice.

373
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,348
Wait. My blood isn't circulating.

374
00:25:58,432 --> 00:26:00,392
Gosh, this...

375
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:02,436
Ms. Park, we have a problem.

376
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:06,565
Some strange people came to Room 2230.
They're trying to take Go Jeongnim away!

377
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:07,858
- Hmm?
- What?

378
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:11,528
- Help!
- Where are you going?

379
00:26:11,612 --> 00:26:13,947
- Damn you.
- What do you think you're doing?

380
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:15,491
Seokhee--

381
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,535
Miss, don't bother. Just go away.

382
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:21,497
- Who are you to order me around?
- Wait.

383
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,875
Oh, my goodness!

384
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:28,462
Hey. Aren't you that witch
who barged into our house?

385
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:30,798
You're right.
She's the one who caused the mess.

386
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:33,383
- Isn't she?
- Oh, I see. You're that lady.

387
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:35,094
You even brought your underlings.

388
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:36,428
And you're alone.

389
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:40,140
You have no right to take our patient
without our permission.

390
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:44,520
- Now leave, all of you.
- We'll be taking her with us. So, move.

391
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:49,316
Hey. I said, move!

392
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:00,953
Excuse me.

393
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:04,039
Who are you to cause a scene
here at the hospital?

394
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:05,749
Mister, go back inside.

395
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:12,339
Ma'am, come here.

396
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:15,300
See? I told you
I couldn't just leave like that.

397
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:16,969
Come here, wench.

398
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:22,140
What kind of weird hospital is this?

399
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:25,477
The patient wants to leave the hospital.

400
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:26,603
Why won't you let her?

401
00:27:26,687 --> 00:27:28,480
She must follow the proper procedure.

402
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:30,190
Leave the patient here and go.

403
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:33,944
- Get out.
- Get off me!

404
00:27:34,695 --> 00:27:36,905
Doctor, are you okay?

405
00:27:37,948 --> 00:27:40,742
Did you people just assault the doctor?

406
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:42,953
Damn. He fell down on his own.

407
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:45,414
What? You want me to help you fall too?

408
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:47,291
Huh? Shall I?

409
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:49,001
You cheeky little--

410
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:52,504
Hey.

411
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:54,965
It actually works?

412
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:56,049
Why you little...

413
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:10,355
My nose!

414
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:15,485
Blood?

415
00:28:16,737 --> 00:28:17,821
A nosebleed.

416
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,074
- Blood.
- Blood.

417
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:23,243
Do you want one too?

418
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:25,871
Ahhh! No, no, wait...

419
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:27,623
What's wrong with you?

420
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:30,208
Why...

421
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:31,668
Force all of these people out.

422
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:33,795
- Yes, sir.
- Let's go.

423
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:35,631
- Not me.
- Come on.

424
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:38,175
No, not me. I'm a patient, really.

425
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:39,718
I'm not dangerous. Look.

426
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:40,802
That minx!

427
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:41,887
Hey, you minx...

428
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,473
Just you wait and see!

429
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:47,851
Seokhee, you're so cool.

430
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:49,937
Thanks, Seokhee!

431
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:59,196
I'm all right.
I might get a slight bruise.

432
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:01,698
No, it's not a slight bruise.

433
00:29:02,616 --> 00:29:04,910
You got a bump. Goodness.

434
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:06,745
Why did you have to get involved?

435
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:09,456
Wait.

436
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:13,210
- What is it?
- Your forehead seems unusual.

437
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:14,670
It's rock-hard.

438
00:29:15,963 --> 00:29:18,131
I mean, it's a good thing.

439
00:29:18,215 --> 00:29:20,634
It protects your brain better.

440
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:25,430
Don't let me down, okay?

441
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:27,557
Of course not.

442
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:30,060
You really don't trust me?

443
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:32,437
My goodness.

444
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:36,483
How could you even compare yourself
to that woman's daughter?

445
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:43,907
If you behave like that again,
I'll take action for real.

446
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:45,867
Got it.

447
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,954
I promise I won't do it.

448
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:53,750
But you shouldn't
headbutt people again, okay?

449
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:55,419
You could get hurt.

450
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:57,212
You're pretty in every way,

451
00:29:57,713 --> 00:30:00,298
but your forehead is the prettiest of all.

452
00:30:02,676 --> 00:30:04,428
Okay, I'll stop headbutting people.

453
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:07,180
Come here.

454
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:09,349
What are you doing?

455
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:11,101
Don't move.

456
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:12,352
It tickles.

457
00:30:12,436 --> 00:30:15,147
- This will help it heal.
- It tickles.

458
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:18,942
Wait.

459
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:20,944
Stay there.

460
00:30:21,028 --> 00:30:22,904
What are you closing
the curtains for?

461
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:25,615
MYOUNGSAN INDUSTRIES

462
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:29,453
Good job.

463
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:31,913
- Thank you, sir.
- So, did you book a table?

464
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:33,165
Yes, sir.

465
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:34,958
At a quiet restaurant.

466
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,461
Okay, okay.

467
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:40,380
Uh, sir, I have something to tell you.

468
00:30:40,464 --> 00:30:41,631
What is it?

469
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:47,429
Seokcheol wants a personal incentive
for his work.

470
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:48,847
An incentive?

471
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:51,183
Well, he rarely asks for money.

472
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:53,560
I guess he needs it for an urgent reason.

473
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:55,312
- How much?
- At least...

474
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:57,856
100 million won.

475
00:30:58,607 --> 00:30:59,858
- 100 million won?
- Yes.

476
00:31:01,151 --> 00:31:04,071
I thought it was a little too much,
so I told him off.

477
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:06,448
I mean, 100 million won
is a lot of money--

478
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,116
Tell him I said okay.

479
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:10,952
Pardon me?

480
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:15,165
That punk, Taehoon, left because of money.

481
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:17,084
I don't want that to happen again.

482
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:18,418
Tell him I'll give him the money.

483
00:31:19,628 --> 00:31:20,796
Don't let him...

484
00:31:22,506 --> 00:31:23,882
think otherwise.

485
00:31:24,341 --> 00:31:25,342
Yes, sir.

486
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:33,058
SAMJUN E&C

487
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:45,487
Sir, everything's set up.

488
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,156
Changsoo is cunning like a fox.

489
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,367
Don't ask the boys to do it.
Do it yourself.

490
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:52,285
Yes, sir.

491
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:53,787
Sir,

492
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:57,707
shouldn't we do something
about Park Seokcheol too?

493
00:31:58,416 --> 00:31:59,960
Honestly, without him there--

494
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:01,128
Just do what you're told.

495
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:07,175
He shouldn't be involved with Changsoo.

496
00:32:09,511 --> 00:32:10,595
Yes, sir.

497
00:33:27,214 --> 00:33:30,467
The Chairman and Sangyeol
will be here soon.

498
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:33,970
Why?

499
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:36,681
Let them come pay their condolences.

500
00:33:37,891 --> 00:33:39,100
Talk it out with them.

501
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,645
- After the funeral.
- Call them.

502
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:43,605
Tell them not to come.

503
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:52,864
Damn it. How diligent of them.

504
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:54,950
Taehoon.

505
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:04,876
Don't take their money.

506
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:10,715
Taehoon.

507
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:12,717
If we do,

508
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:16,137
I'll only feel worse about my sister.

509
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,226
Sir.

510
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,104
My little sister is in there.

511
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:26,106
I mean, Seoyeon.

512
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,403
She died because we couldn't get
30 million won for her surgery.

513
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:35,740
That 30 million won
that you accused me of pocketing,

514
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:38,868
it was for my sister's surgery.

515
00:34:41,288 --> 00:34:42,289
Changsoo.

516
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:44,040
That's enough.

517
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:46,126
Changsoo!

518
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:47,252
Punk.

519
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:48,712
Be respectful towards him.

520
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:51,589
Listen, I get it!
I know it's hard, but be polite--

521
00:34:51,673 --> 00:34:54,217
- Why should I be polite to him, huh?
- Taehoon! Don't!

522
00:34:54,301 --> 00:34:55,343
- You little...
- Taehoon!

523
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:56,720
- Because of you, Seoyeon...
- Stop!

524
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:58,722
Snap out of it, punk.

525
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,315
Let's go, Sangyeol.

526
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:09,399
CONDOLENCES

527
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,444
Take it back.

528
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:16,448
Take it back.

529
00:35:17,032 --> 00:35:18,742
Take it all back.

530
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:22,495
Take it back, you damn thug!

531
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:25,957
Get out. All you thugs, go.

532
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:29,461
Get out, you damn thugs! Go!

533
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:31,880
Get out, you damn thugs!

534
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:33,798
Go!

535
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:35,675
Go!

536
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,803
You thugs, go!

537
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:39,888
Get out now!

538
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,366
Why are you still here?

539
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:05,038
You did well.

540
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:07,624
You did what you had to do to feel better.

541
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:10,126
Those scumbags

542
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:14,047
had three bowls of yukgaejang each.

543
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:16,925
How many bowls did you have?

544
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:20,095
Not even one.

545
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,471
Because you went nuts.

546
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:25,308
Sorry.

547
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:26,685
You can have some now.

548
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,687
You can have four bowls.

549
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,733
I won't mind.

550
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:37,779
You're not like those people.

551
00:36:46,413 --> 00:36:47,580
Seokcheol.

552
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:52,335
Thanks for being by my side.

553
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,468
Come on, man. Don't be silly.

554
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:05,849
I know how much you adore Seokhee.

555
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:07,267
I can relate to that.

556
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:16,693
I'm going to quit.

557
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:24,993
Will you leave with me?

558
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,783
SANGYEOL

559
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:09,704
Hello?

560
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:11,831
<i>Hey, Seokcheol.</i>

561
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:13,833
<i>- He said yes.</i>
- What do you mean?

562
00:38:13,917 --> 00:38:16,461
It's about the money you asked for, punk.
You asked for money.

563
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:23,593
<i>I told the Chairman</i>
<i>that you deserved at least 100 million won</i>

564
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:25,386
<i>for the work you did for us,</i>

565
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:26,721
<i>and he said okay.</i>

566
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:28,640
- Are you sure?
<i>- Yes, you punk.</i>

567
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:31,935
<i>- The Chairman wasn't so happy, but I--</i>

568
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:33,853
Hello? Hey, Seokcheol.

569
00:38:34,604 --> 00:38:35,605
Hello? Seok...

570
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,691
I wasn't even done talking,
and he hung up on me.

571
00:38:38,775 --> 00:38:40,360
That rude punk.

572
00:39:23,653 --> 00:39:26,072
Next person, please get ready.

573
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:27,156
Yes.

574
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:38,251
Wait. What are you doing there?

575
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:42,005
You should come and sing at the mic,
not sit in front of the piano.

576
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:43,298
No backing track?

577
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,508
I'll play the piano
without the backing track--

578
00:39:45,592 --> 00:39:46,593
We don't want that.

579
00:39:46,676 --> 00:39:48,553
It's clearly mentioned
in the audition guidelines.

580
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:51,389
If you don't have a backing track,
please leave.

581
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:54,267
She wants to play the music herself.
Why don't we let her do it?

582
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,019
We can see how good she is.

583
00:40:00,607 --> 00:40:01,983
What's your name?

584
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:03,818
It's Kang Miyoung.

585
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:06,738
"Kang Miyoung."
Even her name's so... Tsk!

586
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:08,156
Anyway, start playing.

587
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,949
Let's get it over with, all right?

588
00:40:16,331 --> 00:40:20,460
<i>- ♪ I'll write you a letter ♪</i>

589
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:27,634
<i>♪ And tell you everything</i>
<i>about how I feel ♪</i>

590
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:33,890

00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:40,563
<i>- ♪ About my unchanging heart ♪</i>

00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:48,863

<i>♪ How endless my love for you is ♪</i>

596
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:11,469
Stop.

597
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,263
That's enough. Next person.

598
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:16,766
Wait, sir. Why? She's good.

599
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:19,060
No, she isn't.

600
00:41:19,686 --> 00:41:22,230
Her voice doesn't have
that emotional quality, you know?

601
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,232
- All right, next.
- Hold on, sir.

602
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:27,193
Aren't you being too biased
about this audition?

603
00:41:27,777 --> 00:41:28,778
Excuse me?

604
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,908
Look, I'm the manager here.

605
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:36,285
If I say no, it's a no. Got it?

606
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:38,955
Excuse me.

607
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:42,000
Does that mean I'm disqualified, then?

608
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:43,292
Yes, you are.

609
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:47,755
We don't have all day.
Hurry up and get off the stage.

610
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:54,053
- Take good care of your voices.
- Yes, sir.

611
00:41:54,137 --> 00:41:55,138
See you.

612
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:56,681
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

613
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:59,267
Minseo.
Tell your father I said hello.

614
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:03,271
- Thank you.
- No problem. Bye.

615
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:08,067
Well, I'd like to ask you something.

616
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:12,947
I'm a little busy right now.

617
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:16,492
What is it? Go on.

618
00:42:16,576 --> 00:42:19,245
I want to know why I didn't make it.

619
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:24,042
Because you weren't good enough.
Why bother asking me?

620
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:26,294
You gave the job
to people who sang off-key.

621
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,420
So, why didn't I...

622
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:31,549
Do I need to give you
technical reasons or something?

623
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:35,178
Well, you are... How should I put it?

624
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:38,473
- Your bending needs work.
- "Bending"?

625
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:42,435
Yes, like in African-American music.
You don't know what I'm talking about?

626
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:44,145
You mean, vibrato?

627
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:45,646
Yes, that. So, you know.

628
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:47,023
You already know, so why ask me?

629
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:51,736
Anyway, I'm busy,
so stop pushing me and get out of here.

630
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:54,030
If that's the reason,

631
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,741
could you give me one more chance?

632
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:08,586
AUDITION FOR BANDS AND SOLO ARTISTS

633
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:34,904
My goal is to bring my mom back
from the nursing home.

634
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:38,282
She hates that place, you know.

635
00:43:38,366 --> 00:43:39,867
And I hate leaving her there.

636
00:43:40,827 --> 00:43:41,828
I see.

637
00:43:41,911 --> 00:43:44,455
Would you feel the same
if you were in my situation?

638
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:46,457
I mean, this is how it is with families.

639
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:50,461
You fight all the time,
but when you're apart from each other,

640
00:43:50,545 --> 00:43:53,422
you miss them,
and look to each other for support.

641
00:43:56,926 --> 00:43:59,679
That's why I did the best I could
with the auditions.

642
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:01,264
I hoped it'd work out.

643
00:44:02,932 --> 00:44:04,267
Oh, well.

644
00:44:04,934 --> 00:44:06,435
I guess I'm not talented.

645
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:08,062
I failed again.

646
00:44:08,938 --> 00:44:10,731
I was really confident this time.

647
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,651
Did they tell you why you didn't make it?

648
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:17,405
Well, most of the judges
seemed to like it,

649
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:20,700
but one of them didn't like my singing.

650
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:22,160
<i>Your name's Miyoung, right?</i>

651
00:44:22,994 --> 00:44:25,329
Do you have money? Or connections?

652
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:28,457
If you do, bring me at least one.

653
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:33,713
You can't simply get a job here.

654
00:44:41,262 --> 00:44:44,223
Miyoung, my shift is over.
I'm leaving work.

655
00:44:45,975 --> 00:44:47,685
- I better go back in.
- Okay, go on.

656
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:49,187
- I'll call you.
- Okay.

657
00:44:53,608 --> 00:44:54,609
Miyoung.

658
00:44:55,985 --> 00:44:58,029
What's the name of that place?

659
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:00,823
Nilbana. It's in Suseong-gu.

660
00:45:01,449 --> 00:45:02,617
Why do you ask?

661
00:45:03,201 --> 00:45:04,827
Because I don't want to go there.

662
00:45:04,911 --> 00:45:06,954
It'd be weird to visit a place
that turned you down.

663
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:11,751
I see. Take care. I'll call you.

664
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:12,835
Okay, bye.

665
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:27,308
Oh, Nilbana? What about it?

666
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:29,101
I'm going there for a reason.

667
00:45:29,185 --> 00:45:30,978
<i>Why don't you go somewhere else?</i>

668
00:45:31,062 --> 00:45:32,063
Why?

669
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:33,940
It comes under the Taehoon Gang turf.

670
00:45:34,023 --> 00:45:37,443
<i>The owner there</i>
<i>is Taehoon's younger cousin or something.</i>

671
00:45:39,028 --> 00:45:41,322
Really? Do they get a lot of customers?

672
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:43,074
<i>Well, it has a good vibe.</i>

673
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:45,201
<i>It's the biggest and busiest place</i>
<i>in the area.</i>

674
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:47,328
Not long ago,

675
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:50,748
a singer who performed there
went viral and became a star.

676
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:53,209
She got recruited
by a big entertainment agency.

677
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:55,002
Really?

678
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:30,538
AUDITION FOR BANDS AND SOLO ARTISTS

679
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:36,377
So, you're telling me
you want her to reaudition?

680
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:37,962
Yes.

681
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:40,423
She said she couldn't show all her talent.

682
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:41,507
Hmm.

683
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:45,553
Did you say her name was Kang Miyoung?

684
00:46:46,846 --> 00:46:49,348
Oh, I remember.
That lady who can't bend notes.

685
00:46:49,432 --> 00:46:51,058
Well, yes.

686
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:54,061
Still, she's quite a skilled singer.

687
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:57,398
I'd like to give her another chance,

688
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,817
but it's not something
I just can do, you know?

689
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:03,738
I know. That's why I came down here myself
to ask you for a favor.

690
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:06,532
A favor...

691
00:47:11,037 --> 00:47:16,125
If you fill my pockets a little,
I could figure out a way to do it.

692
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:18,961
Fill your pockets?

693
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:20,921
As in this?

694
00:47:21,005 --> 00:47:22,256
Correct.

695
00:47:23,007 --> 00:47:24,008
Come on, please.

696
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:27,303
Do you really need to take a bribe
over such a low-paying job?

697
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:28,429
Please be considerate.

698
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:30,473
Are you kidding me?

699
00:47:32,058 --> 00:47:33,726
Okay. I'll give you a discount.

700
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:35,770
Make it 10.

701
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:38,814
How about a million?

702
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:41,609
A million won is hardly enough.

703
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:42,860
10 million.

704
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:44,945
10 million, huh?

705
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:49,033
Tsk!

706
00:47:49,909 --> 00:47:50,910
Okay.

707
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:53,871
I'll cut it down by half.
Five million, okay?

708
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:56,165
Sorry, how much? I didn't hear you.

709
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:58,125
- Could you tell me again?
- Jeez.

710
00:47:58,918 --> 00:48:00,002
Five million.

711
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:03,964
It was you, wasn't it?

712
00:48:04,048 --> 00:48:07,093
You turned Miyoung down
and gave the job to those who bribed you.

713
00:48:07,176 --> 00:48:08,928
Five million, huh?

714
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:10,846
Auditions should always be fair.

715
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:13,391
- Even 500 won is too much for you.
- Ow, my ear!

716
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,603
Sir.

717
00:48:23,192 --> 00:48:26,695
I didn't know
you were acquainted with Bokcheon.

718
00:48:28,114 --> 00:48:30,616
- Let me apologize.
- There's no need.

719
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:33,452
I'm sorry I caused scene.

720
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:35,746
You should've told me.

721
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:37,665
- Hey.
- Yes, sir.

722
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:40,918
Hire that woman who auditioned.
Tell her to begin work right away.

723
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:42,211
Sure, I'll do that.

724
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:44,672
Hey, come on. That's not what I want.

725
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,590
It's an audition. Her skills matter.

726
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:50,094
- Was she good?
- Yes.

727
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:53,180
She was the best of all the candidates.

728
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:54,849
It's true.

729
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:56,725
Then why didn't you hire her?

730
00:48:57,685 --> 00:48:58,727
Pardon me?

731
00:48:58,811 --> 00:49:00,980
It's all good now, right? I'm off.

732
00:49:02,148 --> 00:49:04,775
Sir, why don't you have a drink
while you're here?

733
00:49:04,859 --> 00:49:06,026
Can't. I need to drive.

734
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:08,654
We can talk about
what I told you the other day.

735
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:12,116
Why talk about something
we already discussed?

736
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:14,910
Thugs don't change teams for money
like baseball players do.

737
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:16,579
Bye.

738
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:18,789
- Good-bye!
- Good-bye!

739
00:49:19,999 --> 00:49:21,000
Damn you.

740
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:25,254
You're sound asleep, Mom.

741
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:47,359
Hello?

742
00:49:47,443 --> 00:49:49,195
<i>Is this Ms. Kang Miyoung?</i>

743
00:49:49,278 --> 00:49:50,321
Yes, that's me.

744
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:53,782
<i>This is Yoon Iljoong,</i>
<i>the manager of Nilbana.</i>

745
00:49:53,866 --> 00:49:57,244
There was a misunderstanding
in the evaluation.

746
00:49:57,328 --> 00:49:59,997
<i>It turns out you've passed the audition.</i>

747
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:03,292
- Pardon?
- You got the job.

748
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:05,169
When can you start?

749
00:50:06,212 --> 00:50:07,922
- Tell her to start today.
- Shh!

750
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:10,966
Well, we have a slot available today.
Can you make it?

751
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:13,177
Yes.

752
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:15,471
Of course I can make it.

753
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:18,265
I see. Then please be here by 7:00 p.m.

754
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:20,184
Thank you.

755
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:21,810
Thank you.

756
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:31,654
The plan was to eat,
not play ball, you nutjobs.

757
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:33,155
Come on, just do it.

758
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:35,074
Use your feet, not your mouth. Hurry up.

759
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:36,367
Gosh, you damn idiots.

760
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:38,702
Watch closely.
This is called an eagle shot.

761
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:43,624
Pathetic.

762
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:47,086
If Nature had been more strict
with evolution, you wouldn't have made it.

763
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:49,129
I would've survived thanks to you guys.

764
00:50:49,213 --> 00:50:52,258
You'd go out to fish and get injured,
and I'd treat you guys.

765
00:50:52,341 --> 00:50:53,884
- Don't kick too hard.
- Kick hard.

766
00:50:53,968 --> 00:50:55,761
- This is a super eagle shot.
- Go easy.

767
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:57,888
- Take this!
- Hey!

768
00:50:58,430 --> 00:50:59,598
Oh! Goal!

769
00:50:59,682 --> 00:51:01,225
You idiot! I told you not to kick hard!

770
00:51:02,393 --> 00:51:04,603
- Forget it, I have one here.
- Don't kick hard.

771
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:10,776
- Easy.
- You're dead meat.

772
00:51:13,237 --> 00:51:16,115
This is a super ultra eagle shot!

773
00:51:18,242 --> 00:51:19,493
<i>I got a girlfriend.</i>

774
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:23,998
Really? Who is it?

775
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:26,000
It's someone you know.

776
00:51:26,834 --> 00:51:27,835
Who?

777
00:51:31,255 --> 00:51:32,256
Miyoung.

778
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:33,340
- Who?
- Who's Miyoung?

779
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:35,467
That girl from our childhood?

780
00:51:36,969 --> 00:51:39,972
How did you guys happen to meet again?
Is she doing well?

781
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:42,600
Mmm. She moved into town with her mom.

782
00:51:42,683 --> 00:51:43,934
She's doing well as always.

783
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:45,603
I see.

784
00:51:45,686 --> 00:51:47,313
Yeah. As always, she's well.

785
00:51:47,396 --> 00:51:48,772
And pretty and bright, too.

786
00:51:48,856 --> 00:51:50,232
- She's a singer now.
- What?

787
00:51:50,316 --> 00:51:52,860
- A singer?
- Yes. She'll be famous soon.

788
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:56,030
Let's all go out sometime,
with Byeongsoo, too.

789
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:57,406
Right.

790
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,368
Oh, right. Don't tell Seokhee
about our past relationship.

791
00:52:01,452 --> 00:52:02,995
Keep it from her, okay?

792
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:05,664
Yeah, it isn't a good thing
to bring up the past, anyway.

793
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:10,210
But if she finds out I kept this from her,
she'll beat me to death.

794
00:52:10,294 --> 00:52:11,837
You know what she's like.

795
00:52:12,463 --> 00:52:13,464
Hey.

796
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:15,549
Eat this and cheer up.

797
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:17,301
What about this?

798
00:52:18,302 --> 00:52:20,095
I hope things work out between you two.

799
00:52:20,179 --> 00:52:21,430
I hope so, too.

800
00:52:21,889 --> 00:52:24,558
You guys liked each other so much
back then.

801
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:31,482
All right, our Byeongsoo.

802
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:32,900
- Open up.
- What is it?

803
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:35,152
- Open up!
- What is it?

804
00:52:37,363 --> 00:52:39,114
- We found our sister, you punk.
- Where?

805
00:52:39,198 --> 00:52:41,158
I'll tell you if you pay for this meal.

806
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:42,534
No. I'm broke.

807
00:52:42,618 --> 00:52:44,411
- Oh, come on.
- What's going on?

808
00:52:44,495 --> 00:52:46,747
Hey, do you still have a crush on her?

809
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,123
That's not it.

810
00:52:48,207 --> 00:52:50,876
She's my friend's older sister.
It's not weird to ask.

811
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:53,045
No, that's not it.

812
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:54,463
You're blushing.

813
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:58,509
You can't hide what your body says.
It portrays how you feel.

814
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:00,678
I'm only blushing
because I'm eating something hot.

815
00:53:00,761 --> 00:53:02,221
Who's calling?

816
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:05,099
- Hey, your face is red.
- Exactly.

817
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:06,392
Hey, is it your sister?

818
00:53:06,475 --> 00:53:07,601
Hi.

819
00:53:07,685 --> 00:53:09,770
<i>Guess where I am.</i>

820
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:11,188
Well...

821
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:14,108
I'm not sure. Where?

822
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:18,028
I'm at Nilbana.

823
00:53:19,488 --> 00:53:21,615
Oh, really?

824
00:53:22,783 --> 00:53:23,826
What are you doing there?

825
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:27,204
You won't believe what happened.

826
00:53:27,663 --> 00:53:28,997
But don't be so surprised.

827
00:53:29,665 --> 00:53:31,458
I'm performing here starting today.

828
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:35,170
Wow, that's great. Congratulations.

829
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:38,215
Thanks.

830
00:53:38,716 --> 00:53:41,009
Everything's working out
thanks to your support.

831
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:44,346
Will you come see me tonight?

832
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:45,472
It's my first show.

833
00:53:45,556 --> 00:53:47,933
Of course I will.
I don't want to miss that.

834
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:49,601
Make sure to come.

835
00:53:50,436 --> 00:53:52,855
I need to go.
I'll text you the time and address.

836
00:53:53,689 --> 00:53:54,690
Okay, bye.

837
00:53:55,274 --> 00:53:56,275
Bye.

838
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:04,408
Goodness.

Hello, Mr. Hwang.

858
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:09,676
Nice to meet you.

859
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,386
Mr. Chairman, this is Mr. Hwang.

860
00:57:12,888 --> 00:57:15,515
You could've waited inside for us
instead of out here.

861
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:16,600
MYEONGSAN SEJONG HOTEL

862
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:20,395
I hear people of OSEON E&C
sleep only at five-star hotels.

863
00:57:24,191 --> 00:57:26,526
- That was a good one.
- I love that.

864
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:27,694
<i>Right.</i>

865
00:57:59,685 --> 00:58:00,727
This is a small gift for you.

866
00:58:00,811 --> 00:58:02,854
Oh, goodness. You don't need to do this.

867
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:04,898
Sir, don't make me upset.

868
00:58:06,692 --> 00:58:08,902
Please accept it. It's from me.

869
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:11,363
Gosh, this really isn't necessary.

870
00:58:11,446 --> 00:58:14,324
- Let me pour you a drink.
- Sure, thank you.

871
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:17,452
Who are you?

872
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:19,663
Mr. Kim Changsoo.

873
00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:25,419
Who are you?

874
00:58:31,258 --> 00:58:32,884
We've arrived, Mr. Chairman.

875
00:59:12,674 --> 00:59:14,885
- What is it?
- <i>Boss, we got a problem.</i>

876
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:17,637
The police raided our office,
said they were conducting a search.

877
00:59:17,721 --> 00:59:19,347
What?

878
00:59:19,431 --> 00:59:20,807
What are you talking about?

879
00:59:20,891 --> 00:59:21,892
I'm not sure.

880
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:24,269
Damn it!

881
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:25,687
Heungman. Hey...

882
00:59:27,481 --> 00:59:29,900
MYOUNGSAN POLICE STATION

883
00:59:37,908 --> 00:59:40,160
SANGYEOL

884
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:42,162
Yes, sir.

885
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:43,371
What's going on?

886
00:59:43,455 --> 00:59:44,998
I'm with the Chairman.

887
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:46,917
