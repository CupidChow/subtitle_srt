00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:29,339
Oh.

15
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:31,383
Her name is Kang Miyoung.

16
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:33,552
We've newly hired her through an audition.

17
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:35,554
I like her.

18
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:38,849
There's something

19
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:42,436
touching about her voice.

20
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:45,522
I think she deserves a bigger stage.

21
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,274
That's right.

22
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:49,985
I went the extra mile to hire her.

23
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:51,069
Good job.

24
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:53,113

No, I...

28

Sir.

29
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,270
Okay. I'll talk to you later.

30
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:26,355
Bye.

31
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,154
Where is the Chairman?

32
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:35,822
He's in the holding cell.

Who are you?

35
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:45,832
We're from the Narcotics Team
of Myoungsan Police Station.

36
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:48,085
Drugs? You've got to be kidding me.

37
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,087
Things better not go south.

38
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,630
And do you have a warrant?

39
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,048
Hey, search carefully.

40
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:55,425
Here it is. We found it.

41
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:58,970
Goodness. This is not good.

42
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:02,099
All right. Let's handcuff him.

43
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:04,935
What the heck?

44
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,854
He did drugs? That's ridiculous.

45
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,649
This is a setup. Someone is framing him.

46
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:14,945
It's obvious who's behind this.

47
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:16,530
Right?

48
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,699
The Chairman should've listened to me.

49
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:21,618
When he left to start his own gang,
we should've taken him down.

50
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:25,080
What should we do about this rat?

51
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,373
Should we just wipe them all out?

52
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:30,293
We'll need evidence or reasons
to wipe them out.

53
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:34,172
Wait a bit. I'll check
if this is Kang Taehoon's doing.

54
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:36,049

Put this in an envelope
and hand it to her.

58
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:09,124
- Tell her she did a good job.
- Yes, sir.

59
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,335
- Oh, right.
- Yes?

60
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:14,629
Why don't you

61
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,132
change her slot?

62
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:18,842

67
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,861
Miyoung, good job.

68
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,322
The customers loved it.

69
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,573
Really?

70
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,200
What a relief. Thank you.

71
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,911
Hold on. Good job today. Take this.

72
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,872
- What is it?
- Look inside.

73
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:54,586
This is from the Chairman,
especially for you.

74
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,546
Who is the Chairman? This is so much.

75
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:58,882
You don't know?

76
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:02,636
He's the big shot
of Myoungsan City.

77
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:06,723
He said he loved your performance.

78
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:09,059
I see,

79
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:11,603
but is it okay to take this much--

80
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,980
And guess what he said.

81
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:16,858
He wants you on the main stage
from next time.

82
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:19,069
What?

83
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:23,323
- Really?
- Of course!

84
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:25,242
No way! Thank you. Oh, my goodness.

85
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,870
- Thank you.
- Anyway, greet him when you run into him.

86
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:29,955
Okay.

87
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:35,585
Seokcheol, I seriously don't remember
how I performed.

88
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,712
No, you did well when I was there.

89
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:39,172
<i>I expected I'd be this nervous,</i>

90
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:41,508
but when I went up on stage,
it was pretty okay.

91
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,177
<i>And I have great news.</i>

92
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:47,472
From tomorrow, they want me
on the main stage at 9:00 p.m.

93
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:48,682
<i>Really?</i>

94
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,100
That's great.

95
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:52,477

98
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:57,816

99
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,985
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

100
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:02,946
Okay. Be careful on your way.

101

<i>- Take care.</i>

103
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,707
I'm going to quit this life.

104
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:02,172
I don't know what I'll do after,
but anything will be better than this.

105
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,465
I'm sick and tired of it.

106
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:08,845
Good thinking.

107
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,642
Shouldn't you say
"Good job" or "It must've been tough"?

Are you going somewhere?

113
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:51,781
Yes. Daegi's boiler broke down.
I'm off to see if I can repair it.

114
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:56,453
Hey.

115
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,164
Did you mean what you said last night?

116
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,167
You said you'd quit.

117
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:04,753
Yes, of course.

118
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,049
Good thinking.

119
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:19,809
Did you tape it thoroughly?

120
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,352
Yes, I did.

121
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:22,437
Come out now.

122
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,607
Oh, it's all taken care of.

123
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:28,610
Go and check if hot water comes out.

124
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:33,198
He keeps it off all winter

125
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:36,242
and only starts turning it on and off
as spring comes.

126
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:38,286
It makes the boiler malfunction.

127
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,330
Watch what you say around him.

128
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,916
- Hurry up and check the water.
- Fine.

129
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,918
Go on and check. Hot water will come out.

130
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:49,631
Sir, are you that happy?

131
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,467
- What are you saying?
- Gosh.

132
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,220
When you walked through that gate
earlier today,

133
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,679
you were grinning from ear to ear.

134
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:59,099
I thought you won a lottery or something.

135
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:01,601
If it makes you that happy,

136
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:06,064
you should've told him to quit
a long time ago.

137
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:07,148
Tsk!

138
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:11,277
Honestly, I was too afraid to tell him.

139
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:15,907
In case he said I didn't have the right
to tell him such a thing.

140
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:19,077
I hesitated
and ended up missing the right time.

141
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:24,332
But now that he's made up his mind,
I feel so relieved.

142
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:30,171
Yes, he made the right decision
before it was too late.

143
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:35,093
By the way, what is he going to do
once he quits being a gangster?

144
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:38,304
Damn you. He's young enough,
he can do anything for a living.

145
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,557

That's good. It's as we expected.

151
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:55,697
Look into what happened

Okay, I'll do that.

I'm a 42nd graduate of Myoungsan High.

There's no need to shout.

160
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:22,765
I came to give you this.

161
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,100
What is it?

162
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,977
It's my book report on Kim Ku.

163
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,896
You said you'd take me in if I wrote it.

164
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,192
Do you have good grades?

165
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:34,152
No, sir.

166
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:36,362
- Are you a bottom-rank student?
- No.

167
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:38,990
I'm, like, second or third

168
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:40,575

00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,160
What? Why do you ask?

182
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:25,245
Hey, you punk.

183
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:28,539
If a friend asks you something,
just give him an answer.

184
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:31,834
- Then, let me ask you something too.
- What is it?

185
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:34,045
Yesterday, my boss...

186
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,631
Tsk!

187
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,884
Gosh, forget it.
An underling like you wouldn't know much.

188
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:44,138
<i>I'll text you the address.</i>
<i>Go find your first love.</i>

189
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:05,910
Who... Who is it?

190
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:09,664
Who... Gosh.

191
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,793
Who is it?

192
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:16,379
Ms. Park Seokkyung.

193
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,299
- Yes?
- This is the police.

194
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:22,427
If you don't open the door,
I'll break in.

195
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:24,178
Open the door.

196
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,937
Who are you looking for, again?

197
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:35,523
Ms. Park Seokkyung.

198
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:40,153
Oh, that person doesn't live here.

199
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,946
I think she does.

200
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,323
Do I seem that easy to you?

201
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:46,659
You think I wouldn't even recognize
my first love?

202
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:49,746
It's me, Byeongsoo.

203
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:51,330
Byeongsoo?

204
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,669
Goodness gracious.

205
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,172
You're crazy.

206
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,340
You freaked me out.

207
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:02,633
I was just kidding.

208
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:04,802
You can't joke around like that.

209
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:05,928
You're an actual cop.

210
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:08,347
Back in the day,
I used to tease you and run away too.

211
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,809
Jeez, you scared the heck out of me.

212
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:14,062
Hey.

213
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:16,314
Am I really your first love?

214
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:17,982
You didn't know?

215
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,319
Well, I just thought you kind of liked me.

216
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:22,820
First love, my foot.

217
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:26,699
But thanks

218
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,243
for having me as your first love.

219
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:33,164
Gosh. I didn't expect myself
to be this romantic either.

220
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:34,499
I still have a crush on you.

221
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,210
Hey, I'm a mom now.

222
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,879
So what if you're a mom?
Am I not allowed to like a mom?

223
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,047
My goodness.

224
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:42,965
Do you even hear yourself?

225
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,634
You're weird.

226
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,469
Gosh.

227
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,641
You're in a lot of trouble, aren't you?

228
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,603
Seokcheol told me about it briefly.

229
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,650
So, you know my whole situation.

230
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:05,029
If I help you with those issues,
will you do me one favor?

231
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:09,200
- What favor?
- It's no fun if I tell you in advance.

232
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,244
You have to promise me first.

233
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:13,663
- Come on.
- What the...

234
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:16,249
- Here, promise.
- What...

235
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,043
You've given me your word now.

236
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:20,336
Hey, this is too one-sided.

237
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:26,592
Goodness.

238
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,012
I'm off.

239
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:36,102
Gosh. What's with that guy?

240
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,690
And why is my heart racing?

241
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:42,692
Goodness.

242
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:44,902
Calm down.

243
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,029
Chill out.

244
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,790
Have this one. Don't eat this.

245
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:59,250
How sour is it?

246
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:04,547
Jeez! This is too sour!

247
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:08,551
You look good, Mom.

248
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:18,477
Mom, it was probably our fate
to come back to this neighborhood.

249
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,272
You know, sometimes,

250
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:25,234
you belatedly return
to your predestined path.

251
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:29,071
When I left this neighborhood,

252
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:31,866
I thought everything was cut off from me.

253
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,786
I felt like I'd never be able to go back
to the way things were before.

254
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:39,123
I felt as if I was lost.

255
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,584
I felt like I'd lost everything.

256
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:43,544
You,

257
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:48,132
and the man I liked.

258
00:16:57,433 --> 00:17:00,102
Don't be sick, Mom.
Everything will be okay now.

259
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:03,064
You'll support me, right?

260
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:06,525
- Yes.
- Thank you.

261
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,821
Eat slowly, Mom, like this. Have this one.

262
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,953
I feel sorry for our Changsoo.

263
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,038
He should've settled for a small company
and retired.

264
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,373
Why did he have to challenge us?

265
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:25,044
Mr. Yoo, visit OSEON
and hand them our estimate again today.

266
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,879
We'll get that third district back.

267
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,173
I bet they're quite scared.

268
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:30,383
Yes, sir.

269
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:32,718
Go back to work.

270
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:51,696
I'm listening.

271
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:53,823
Did you look into it?

272
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:01,539
Jaebong, go quickly.

273
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:09,255
Hey, Cheonho.

274
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,048
Stand here.

275
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:16,804
Stand properly, you punk.

276
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:24,478
You should've at least let me know
before you made a move.

277
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:29,025
The Chairman wanted me
to keep it a secret.

278
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,109
As if.

279
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:35,406
Then you can take the fall alone.

280
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,286
Report everything to me from now on.

281
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:42,079
Got it?

282
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:50,212
SEOKCHEOL

283
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:53,966
You're dismissed.

284
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:03,684
Hello, sir.

285
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,561
Yes.

286
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:07,271
Oh, I'm a little busy today--

287
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,150
Yes, sir.

288
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,278
Yes.

289
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:16,447
So, there's that thing?

290
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,657
NILBANA MANAGER YOON ILJOONG

291
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,241
Wait.

292
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,411
Go on. What's the name?

293
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:25,748
"Little Singing Room"?

294
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,835
Okay, got it. Bye.

295
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,506
Subscribe.

00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,093

You're paying me back so soon.

301

You're first on my list of people

I know you're short on money too.

305
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:12,294
Anyway, did you reach out to my brother
after I gave you his number?

306
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,756
Yes, I did.

307
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,299
Did you meet him?

308
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:20,928
So, you did.

309
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:24,098
You actually did.
Are you going to get serious?

310
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:25,975
What are you talking about?

311
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,062
- Oh, my.
- What?

312
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:32,189
Are you really? My gosh.

313
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:33,983
- Well...
- What in the world?

314
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,026
You've become like magnets
after just one date?

315
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:38,154
- No...
- Are you in a relationship?

316
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,824
No, not at all. We're not there yet.

317
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:45,161
You know, we're just open
to what's going to happen next.

318
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,245
This is insane.

319
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:48,622
Good luck to both of you.

320
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:51,125
Is my credibility still the same?

321
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:54,754
No, it's gone up
now that you're seeing my brother.

322
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:58,132
I wish all the best
for both you and my brother.

323
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,801
You may not know,

324
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:03,596
but he wouldn't be like this
had he not gotten expelled.

325
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,849
He dropped out of school?

326
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,560
He got expelled, he didn't drop out.

327
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:11,854
I didn't know.

328
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,941
Mmm, it happened
after you transferred schools.

329
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,694
He caused a serious problem.

330
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:21,197
Remember those bullies from Sungpo High?

331
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:23,783
He went to their school,

332
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:26,619
broke all the windows, and beat them up.
It was crazy.

333
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:30,664
He almost got sent to a reformatory,
and ended up getting expelled.

334
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:33,459
<i>No way.</i>

335
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:34,919
He used to be a nerd.

336
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,921
I don't know what made him
suddenly do that.

337
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,088
Why are you doing this?

338
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,760
If not for that,
his life would've been different.

339
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:50,726
What is it?

340
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,270
What? No, nothing.

341
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,106
Oh, I better get going.

342
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,901
- Have a good day. I'm off.
- Okay, bye.

343
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,013

00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:44,488
It's like a children's song.

348
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:47,283
- Damn.
- This won't do.

349
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:48,993
Let's strip her and take pictures.

350
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:53,289
Let go of me.

351
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,040
Get undressed.

352
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:57,167
- Why are you doing this?
- Don't move.

353
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:58,919
- Stop.
- Hey.

354
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:00,588
You little...

355
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:02,464
- Stop it.
- Kneel.

356
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,093
- Does it capture her face?
- Yes, it does.

357
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:07,177
It looks nice.

358
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,097
It's coming out very well.

359
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:12,516
- Show me your face.
- Hey, open your eyes.

360
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,851
Raise your head.

361
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:15,561
Are you filming this?

362
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:46,300
Because of me.

363
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:50,846
It was because of me.

364
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:55,768
<i>♪ Just know how much I love you ♪</i>

365
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:59,605
<i>♪ Tell me how much you love me too ♪</i>

366
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:04,401
<i>- ♪ Forever stay in my heart... ♪</i>

367
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:08,656
- Hello?
- <i>Seokcheol.</i>

368
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:10,950
<i>- Where are you?</i>
- What?

369
00:24:12,076 --> 00:24:14,370
I'm out to meet someone.

370
00:24:14,912 --> 00:24:16,163
<i>Can you come over later?</i>

371
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,499
Of course.

372
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:19,917
I'll be there for sure today.

373
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,669
Did you call me to ask that?

374
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:26,632
I just have something to say

375
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:28,342
and ask you about.

376
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:30,469
What is it?

377
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:34,682
About things you didn't tell me.

378
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:39,979
<i>About what happened to you</i>
<i>after I left this neighborhood.</i>

379
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:42,564
Why didn't you tell me anything?

380
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:55,411
It's all in the past.

381
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,038
I'll see you there later.

382
00:24:58,497 --> 00:24:59,665
Okay, bye.

383
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,271
<i>About things you didn't tell me.</i>

384
00:25:23,397 --> 00:25:26,400
<i>About what happened to you</i>
<i>after I left this neighborhood.</i>

385
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:30,446
<i>Why didn't you tell me anything?</i>

386
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:51,050
Miyoung!

387
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:55,679
Miyoung!

388
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:13,072
<i>♪ Stay with me, oh ♪</i>

389
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:16,325
<i>♪ Stay with me, oh ♪</i>

390
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:25,250
<i>♪ Stay with me, oh ♪</i>

391
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:29,922
<i>♪ Stay with me, oh ♪</i>

392
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:35,719
Come out, you bastards.

393
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:38,847
Come out!

394
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:42,267
Come out!

395
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:27,187
Okay.

396
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:48,333
- Hello?
<i>- Hi, Seokhee. This is Byeongsoo.</i>

397
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:49,710
I need your help.

398
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:50,919
<i>What is it?</i>

399
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:55,173
Really?

400
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:57,759
Okay.

401
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:04,808
All right, look.
When you play <i>seotda,</i>

402
00:28:04,892 --> 00:28:09,855
you take out the minor cards
and use these 20 cards from 1 to 10.

403
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:11,690
You know one, two, three, and four, right?

404
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:12,774
I do.

405
00:28:13,984 --> 00:28:19,823
Anyway, don't doctors play cards
at occasions like funerals?

406
00:28:19,907 --> 00:28:22,409
Of course we do. We do it a lot.

407
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:25,621
But I tend to watch others play
instead of playing cards myself.

408
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:31,960
You're so nerdy.

409
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:37,382
I mean, a man should know
how to play cards.

410
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:40,552
Right, so I'd like to learn
some basics at least.

411
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:42,137
That's a great attitude.

412
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,388
All right, then.

413
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:46,516
Which do you think is the strongest pair?

414
00:28:51,355 --> 00:28:52,606
- Pair of 10.
- Wrong.

415
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:54,858
You got it wrong. It's Bright Pair.

416
00:28:54,942 --> 00:28:57,569
Wait, what? Bright Pair is stronger?

417
00:28:57,653 --> 00:29:00,364
But the chief radiologist said
Pair of 10 was stronger.

418
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:04,868
Oh, rules differ a bit
depending on regions.

419
00:29:04,952 --> 00:29:07,537
But in the capital area,
Bright Pair is stronger.

420
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:10,207
I see. So, that man plays
countryside cards.

421
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,709
That's right.

422
00:29:12,793 --> 00:29:14,419
Look, these are the Bright cards.

423
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:18,882
Of all, the strongest pair is
Bright Pair of three and eight.

424
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:20,717
If you have this, you'll win for sure.

425
00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:26,807
What are you doing here?

426
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,266
I was asking her some questions.

427
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,894
He says he doesn't know
how to play <i>seotda.</i>

428
00:29:30,978 --> 00:29:33,355
So, I'm teaching him some tips.

429
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:36,900
All right, the second strongest pair
is Pair of 10.

430
00:29:36,984 --> 00:29:39,111
Bright Pair. I better take notes.

431
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:40,237
What are you talking about?

432
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:43,532
Let's go. Byeongsoo's here.

433
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:45,534
Byeongsoo? Why?

434
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:47,786
Put your shoes on.

435
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:49,121
Well, then...

436
00:29:49,997 --> 00:29:54,042
I'd appreciate it if you could
teach me again another time.

437
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:55,836
Sure, Doctor. Make sure you come.

438
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,212
- Sure.
- Okay, bye.

439
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,424
Jeez, I was having fun.

440
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:01,883
She's never of any help.

441
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:04,594
Gosh.

442
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:08,932
Oh, my goodness.

443
00:30:09,683 --> 00:30:10,809
Jeez.

444
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:13,311
She sure is Seokcheol's younger sister.

445
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,313
Is her forehead okay?

446
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:17,232
She's fine, medically speaking.

447
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:22,446
Is it necessary to watch the footage
to catch these scumbags?

448
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:24,448
I know where their gambling house is.

449
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:27,451
A gambling house isn't something
that stays in one place.

450
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:29,870
You get the composite sketches
before investigating.

451
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:32,164
I see. You're a cop after all.

452
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:34,207
Here you go, sir.

453
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:35,667
- Thank you.
- No problem.

454
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:39,546
Gosh, okay.

455
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:44,426
Seokhee.

456
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:48,221
Call me for everything
related to Seokkyung from now on.

457
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:51,099
Things got out of hand
because you called Seokcheol.

458
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:53,560
Still, it's our family's business.

459
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:58,398
Hey, don't be like that.
I got so much free food from your family.

460
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:01,693
When Seokcheol makes a move,
it's an act of violence.

461
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:04,696
When I take action,
it's realizing justice.

462
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:11,203
I'll be more than grateful.

463
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:15,165
But why do you suddenly want
to realize justice with our family?

464
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:17,042
Must there be a reason?

465
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:19,127
Seokkyung is struggling.
And I can't stand it.

466
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:21,630
You're unbelievable.

467
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:24,091
She might end up breaking your heart.

468
00:31:24,174 --> 00:31:25,717
Leave him be.

469
00:31:25,801 --> 00:31:27,969
He thinks your sister is
still the queen of Myoungsan.

470
00:31:29,096 --> 00:31:31,139
A queen never loses her class, you punk.

471
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:33,558
Once a hottie, always a hottie.

472
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:35,185
She's not as pretty as before.

473
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:36,269
That's not true!

474
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:38,438
What are you...

475
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:40,440
a plastic surgeon?

476
00:31:40,524 --> 00:31:41,733
You're an orthopedist.

477
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:44,361
I don't have to be a plastic surgeon
to know that.

478
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:46,863
Regardless of looks,
faces are the same on an X-ray scan.

479
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:51,910
Tell her... Gosh, sorry.

480
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:55,163
Hey. Did you just look down
on orthopedists?

481
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,165
Dude, you're clueless.

482
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:59,167
Those guys just never change.

483
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:02,045
After all this time,
they're still like they were back then.

484
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:30,323
- Excuse me.
- What in the...

485
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:36,955
Ashtray.

486
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:39,124
It's Ashtray. Hey, Ashtray!

487
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:40,709
Wait!

488
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,219
Stop there!

489
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,721
Dang.

490
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:53,805
Wait.

491
00:32:57,267 --> 00:32:58,268
Wait up.

492
00:33:08,028 --> 00:33:09,112
Gosh, I can't do this.

493
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,575
This is killing me.

494
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,703
Was she a track-and-field athlete?

495
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:21,458
Okay.

496
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:24,544
She's in this neighborhood.
That's for sure.

497
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:26,213
She's dead meat.

498
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,139
Jeez, this is bad. It's driving me nuts.

499
00:33:36,223 --> 00:33:38,642
How did he know I was here?

500
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:39,809
Damn it.

501
00:33:54,324 --> 00:33:56,451
Sir, did you have lunch?

502
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:01,831
Hey, Bokcheon.

503
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:05,877
Come on, even between gangsters,
this isn't right, is it?

504
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:09,464
There's nothing
I can say officially.

505
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:11,925
You better answer me wisely.

506
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:14,970
It sounds like you did that.

507
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:18,807
Sir, please let it slide this time.

508
00:34:19,975 --> 00:34:21,935
Taehoon is in the office now.

509
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:23,812
I'll go and try to sort things out.

510
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:26,481
As if you'll actually do that.

511
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,692
Sir.

512
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:30,568
Where are you going?

513
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,905
I'm off to meet Kang Taehoon, you punk.

514
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:35,407
What? But...

515
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:36,992
Sir!

516
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:38,243
Damn it.

517
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:47,794
SAMJUN E&C

518
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:54,592
Hey, where do you think you're going?

519
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:56,303
Where are you going?

520
00:34:58,346 --> 00:34:59,472
Hey, kid.

521
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:02,350
You're not supposed to come in here.

522
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:03,768
Boys, come out.

523
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:05,895
I'm here to meet Taehoon.
He's inside, right?

524
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,065
I'm lost for words.

525
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:13,069
Since when are you
and the Chairman friends?

526
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:16,448
I don't have to give you all the details.

527
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:22,162
Boys.

528
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:23,955
I'll take only five minutes. Must you--

529
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:32,213
Hey, you.

530
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:42,015
I'll break open the next one's head,
so stop, okay?

531
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:55,320
Wait. Hey, stop! Stop it, you punks.

532
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:56,696
Hey, Cheonho. Back off.

533
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:57,781
Damn it.

534
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:00,408
Sir, please don't do this.

535
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:02,869
I said I just needed five minutes.
What is this?

536
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:03,953
Must I make a reservation?

537
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,665
Look at him.
He's about to take out a weapon.

538
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:07,791
Put that back, you damn punk.

539
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,628
- Sir, let's go out and talk.
- Seokcheol.

540
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,422
What are you doing there? It's noisy.

541
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,176
Come in.

542
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:25,850
Damn it.

543
00:36:29,479 --> 00:36:31,147
Isn't it your first time
coming to my office?

544
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:34,401
My men don't recognize you
because you never come.

545
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:37,570
Goodness, don't look too serious.

546
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:39,030
Others might think

547
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:41,116
you're here to kill someone.

548
00:36:42,075 --> 00:36:44,994
Was it necessary
to take it this far?

549
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:47,038
What are you talking about?

550
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:50,709
You didn't have to frame the Chairman
for doing drugs.

551
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:55,296
He's old now. It'll do him good
to get a blood test done.

552
00:36:58,133 --> 00:37:01,010
Apologize to him,
and put an end to this here.

553
00:37:02,512 --> 00:37:03,930
It's not your place to say that.

554
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,601
You know how I left Changsoo's gang.

555
00:37:09,811 --> 00:37:13,440
I'll arrange a time

556
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:17,110
for you two to talk everything out.

557
00:37:17,694 --> 00:37:20,405
Otherwise, this will be nothing
but a lose-lose situation for you both.

558
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:25,452
Hey, I don't want to have
this kind of talk with you.

559
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:28,163
Okay? Let's just go out
and have some soju.

560
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:29,748
What are you saying?

561
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:33,877
You have to listen
to what displeases you too,

562
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,545
not just what pleases you.

563
00:37:37,547 --> 00:37:38,548
Okay.

564
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:41,718
Go on.

565
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:46,139
Taehoon.

566
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:49,934
I'm begging you.

567
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:53,229
Please stop now.

568
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:57,400
Stop?

569
00:38:00,737 --> 00:38:03,198
Guess what Seohyun said before she died.

570
00:38:05,492 --> 00:38:07,577
She said she wanted me
to be a good person.

571
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,121
Like you.

572
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,253
But Changsoo and Sangyeol
are stopping me from being good.

573
00:38:17,337 --> 00:38:18,588
What can I do?

574
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:25,470
Call the Chairman.

575
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:28,139
Otherwise, it'll lead to a war for real.

576
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:29,808
It won't end until someone dies.

577
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:34,771
If Changsoo tells you

578
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:38,858
to kill me, will you do it?

579
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:42,487
Please.

580
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,948
Must you polarize people like that?

581
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:51,454
Dude, that's how you survive
in this field.

582
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:53,915
Good luck, then. Goodness.

583
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:56,292
Seokcheol.

584
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:00,088
How did we drift apart like this?

585
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,967
I don't want to be on bad terms with you.

586
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:08,680
I mean it.

587
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:14,185
Same here.

588
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:32,912
What?

589
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:34,664
Why did you go meet Kang Taehoon?

590
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:37,166
I told you to find out who did it,
not meet him.

591
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,960
I thought it'd be faster
to ask him in person.

592
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:41,087
So?

593
00:39:41,671 --> 00:39:43,214
Did he come clean
and say it was his doing?

594
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:45,633
Of course not. I didn't expect him to.

595
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:48,261
My point, exactly!
You shouldn't have gone there!

596
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:51,681
I told him I'd arrange a time, and that
he should reach out to the Chairman.

597
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:53,391
That's pointless!

598
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:55,852
As if he'd reach out to the Chairman.

599
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:57,395
Let's wait a bit.

600
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:58,479
Gosh, that jerk.

601
00:39:58,563 --> 00:40:02,650
Why did you have to visit him
and ask him for a favor, you punk?

602
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:04,777
He's no longer your senior!

603
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:06,446
He's an enemy, punk!

604
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:08,114
Right.

605
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:09,616
Gosh, that damn scumbag.

606
00:40:15,622 --> 00:40:17,916
So, what else did he say?

607
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:19,500
Did he talk shit about me?

608
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:22,629
<i>Be careful of Sangyeol.</i>

609
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:26,341
He wants to make sure
he remains Changsoo's right-hand man.

610
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:28,343
Think wisely.

611
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:31,679
I'm telling you to join my side
before you end up like me.

612
00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:34,682
They have no future.

613
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:40,939
Gosh, no.
It wasn't that kind of situation.

614
00:40:41,022 --> 00:40:42,941
- He didn't say anything.
- He didn't?

615
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:44,025
That's unusual of him.

616
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:49,989
What's that noise?

617
00:40:50,073 --> 00:40:52,367
- What the... What is it?
- What is it?

618
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:55,662
Take what? Tell me.

619
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:58,206
What did I take, you punk?

620
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,500
Do you want to die? Come here.

621
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:02,752
I'm going to kill you, damn you!

622
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:04,796
- Get off me!
- Hey!

623
00:41:05,672 --> 00:41:06,673
What do you think you're doing?

624
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:11,552
Sir, this punk shows no respect
to his senior.

625
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:13,012
He's much younger than me too!

626
00:41:13,096 --> 00:41:14,597
Act like a senior, then.

627
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:15,932
- What, you punk?
- What?

628
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:17,225
- Want to die?
- Hey!

629
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:18,643
Dusik!

630
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:21,020
Both of you, follow me.

631
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:23,940
Gosh!

632
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:36,452
Hey, you.

633
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:40,081
And you. What was that?

634
00:41:40,707 --> 00:41:43,376
Ilsu, Dusik is your senior in any case.

635
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:44,961
That was inappropriate, you punk.

636
00:41:45,962 --> 00:41:47,213
I'm sorry, sir.

637
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:48,840
But I did that for a reason.

638
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:52,135
Dusik takes money from his juniors
every time he drinks these days.

639
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:54,012
For gambling.

640
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,307
- What?
- If they refuse, he punishes them.

641
00:41:58,391 --> 00:42:00,518
Yesterday, he stole a credit card
from my wallet.

642
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:03,354
Sir, the thing is...

643
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:06,357
I randomly found the credit card
and picked it up.

644
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:09,110
And I didn't take money,
I only borrowed it. I'll repay them.

645
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:11,446
It's true.

646
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:16,784
Ilsu, get out.

647
00:42:29,422 --> 00:42:31,049
Goodness.

648
00:42:31,132 --> 00:42:32,133
Jeez.

649
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:46,272
The Chairman is in a holding cell,
and the gang is a mess.

650
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:47,482
Goodness.

651
00:43:01,454 --> 00:43:03,039
What is it?

652
00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:07,210
It's me, sir.

653
00:43:11,464 --> 00:43:13,508
What's the matter with you?

654
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:16,260
Where have you been hiding out until now?

655
00:43:16,344 --> 00:43:18,971
I said I was off to Gyeongju
for my dad's death anniversary.

656
00:43:20,223 --> 00:43:22,391
Have some bread.

657
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:26,687
I know you're unhappy with Dusik
for causing too much trouble.

658
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:30,274
This is all because of
our company's lack of benefits.

659
00:43:31,067 --> 00:43:32,902
What about our company's benefits,
you punk?

660
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:34,112
Let's be honest.

661
00:43:34,195 --> 00:43:36,239
We may not have as much money
as the Taehoon Gang does,

662
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:37,490
but we've got pride.

663
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:41,577
But these days, you know,
since they changed their system,

664
00:43:41,661 --> 00:43:43,996
we've been falling behind in many ways.

665
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:45,832
They changed their system?

666
00:43:45,915 --> 00:43:48,334
They work five days a week, to begin with.

667
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:51,003
Five days a week? Are you sure?

668
00:43:51,087 --> 00:43:55,049
Yes. Rookie gangsters these days
have a totally different attitude.

669
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:57,593
They ask if we provide
any employment insurance.

670
00:43:57,677 --> 00:44:01,597
Anyway, you should consider offering
an incentive to strengthen our gang

671
00:44:02,223 --> 00:44:04,058
at a time like this.

672
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:05,560
Oh, is that why?

673
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:07,895
You've been bad at your job
because you get no incentives?

674
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:09,522
I'm not bad at my job, sir.

675
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:13,192
Whenever something happens,
you always go off the grid.

676
00:44:13,276 --> 00:44:14,277
Goodness!

677
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,155
I don't need you anymore.

678
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:18,489
You can join somewhere

679
00:44:18,573 --> 00:44:21,033
that provides weekends off
and lots of incentives.

680
00:44:21,117 --> 00:44:22,869
- I apologize.
- No, I apologize.

681
00:44:22,952 --> 00:44:24,996
Stop coming to work
starting tomorrow, okay?

682
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:27,206
And take all your stuff out of here.

683
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:29,000
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Get out, you punk.

684
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:30,668
Get out, I said.

685
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:34,213
Enjoy the bread all you want.

686
00:44:40,011 --> 00:44:43,055
Goodness, every single one of them
gets on my nerves!

687
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:45,516
ATTORNEY KWON

688
00:44:50,271 --> 00:44:51,439
Hello, sir.

689
00:44:57,028 --> 00:44:59,113
I said I'd take action
if you gambled again.

690
00:44:59,906 --> 00:45:00,907
I apologize.

691
00:45:03,743 --> 00:45:05,745
Your eyes don't tell me that you're sorry.

692
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:07,288
They say you want to kill me.

693
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:11,167
You think it's unfair that I hit you?

694
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,002
"Who do you think you are?" Is that it?

695
00:45:13,878 --> 00:45:14,879
No, sir.

696
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:16,088
I'm sorry.

697
00:45:16,172 --> 00:45:18,549
You apologized hundreds of times already!

698
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:24,388
Hey, why is he sitting
in a corner looking upset?

699
00:45:24,472 --> 00:45:25,765
You mean, Dusik?

700
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:29,644
He recently gambled away his house deposit
and went broke.

701
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,687
He sleeps at a sauna these days.

702
00:45:32,188 --> 00:45:33,814
He asked me for money, too.

703
00:45:33,898 --> 00:45:35,566
I mean, I have no money to lend.

704
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:37,902
- Let's hurry.
- Yes, sir.

705
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:39,111
Take this.

706
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:42,365
Take the money,

707
00:45:43,324 --> 00:45:44,408
and I'll keep this.

708
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:46,535
Thank you, sir.

709
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:49,330
- Dusik.
- Yes, sir.

710
00:45:49,789 --> 00:45:51,040
As someone older,

711
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:54,877
- let me nag you and ask you a favor.
- Yes, sir.

712
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:57,922
Quit gambling.

713
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:00,466
I'm sorry, sir.

714
00:46:01,217 --> 00:46:02,760
Gambling doesn't suit you.

715
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:04,220
You can't keep a poker face.

716
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:08,099
I'll quit, sir.

717
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:13,771
Get your life together.

718
00:46:14,522 --> 00:46:17,316
If you gamble again,
you'll never see me again.

719
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,068
Do you get what I mean?

720
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:21,570
I'm sorry.

721
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:28,244
Hey. Stop that and come with me.
The Chairman's being released.

722
00:46:28,953 --> 00:46:30,079
Yes, sir.

723
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:36,419
- I'm back, sir.
- Hey. When did you return?

724
00:46:49,849 --> 00:46:51,350
Seokkyung, what are you up to?

725
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:54,562
I'm doing nothing. What's up?

726
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:56,439
Why do you sound so down?

727
00:46:56,522 --> 00:46:58,399
- Did you skip a meal?
<i>- I have no appetite.</i>

728
00:46:59,734 --> 00:47:00,901
I just feel empty.

729
00:47:00,985 --> 00:47:03,195
Why? Do you miss Hyeonggeun?

730
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:05,406
<i>Still, you should eat something.</i>

731
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:07,158
What's the use of eating

732
00:47:07,867 --> 00:47:09,243
when my heart is empty?

733
00:47:09,327 --> 00:47:12,455
- Why don't you have some donuts with me?
<i>- Donuts?</i>

734
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:14,915
I'm here to meet you.

735
00:47:14,999 --> 00:47:16,334
<i>- I'm coming up.</i>
- Wait.

736
00:47:16,417 --> 00:47:18,586
Wait. You're down there?

737
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:19,754
<i>Meet me for a bit.</i>

738
00:47:20,296 --> 00:47:21,589
Hold on. Wait.

739
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:23,341
Don't come up, wait.

740
00:47:23,424 --> 00:47:26,594
Come up when I tell you to, okay?

741
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:28,679
Seokkyung, why--

742
00:47:32,141 --> 00:47:33,142
So cute.

743
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:35,102
Goodness, why donuts?

744
00:47:35,186 --> 00:47:37,313
Donuts will only make me fat.

745
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:39,273
Jeez.

746
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:43,652
She doesn't have
to doll herself up, though.

747
00:47:43,736 --> 00:47:45,529
Have you seen this woman
in the area?

748
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:47,990
No.

749
00:47:48,074 --> 00:47:49,283
Then, go.

750
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:55,706
Gosh, okay.

751
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:09,887
Excuse me.
Have you seen this woman around?

752
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:14,433
- Gosh, she's pretty.
- No way.

753
00:48:15,184 --> 00:48:16,435
Does she look pretty only to me?

754
00:48:16,519 --> 00:48:18,437
I've seen her many times. I know her well.

755
00:48:18,521 --> 00:48:19,688
- Really?
- Yes.

756
00:48:19,772 --> 00:48:22,191
Then, do you know where she lives?

757
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:24,693
Of course I do.
Get in. I'll drive you there.

758
00:48:24,777 --> 00:48:25,945
You'll give me a ride? Thanks.

759
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:28,197
- Can you send me that photo?
- Sure.

760
00:48:30,408 --> 00:48:33,285
Look, I think you're mistaken.

761
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:36,789
You really are mistaken.

762
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:38,707
She's a close friend of mine.

763
00:48:38,791 --> 00:48:40,668
I'm just wondering how she's doing.

764
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:42,795
- Is she doing well?
- Is she pretty or not?

765
00:48:43,504 --> 00:48:44,755
She's beautiful, I think.

766
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:46,382
Good boy.

767
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:49,009
Now, follow your conscience and brain

768
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:52,555
to answer my questions
at the count of two.

769
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:54,098
- Okay?
- Yes, sir.

770
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:57,768
- Where is your gambling house?
- A green house?

771
00:48:57,852 --> 00:48:59,645
One. Two.

772
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:07,653
What the...

773
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:10,906
<i>Sorry, Seokkyung.</i>
<i>I suddenly have to go somewhere.</i>

774
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:13,075
<i>I'll visit you again with a gift.</i>

775
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:14,368
What's with this guy?

776
00:49:22,418 --> 00:49:24,712
What was I doing?

777
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:25,796
Goodness.

778
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:31,343
- Stay still. You're distracting me.
- Yes, sir.

779
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:34,597
Goodness gracious.

780
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:44,607
MYOUNGSAN POLICE STATION

781
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:48,235
Oh.

782
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:50,446
I'm sorry for your trouble, sir.

783
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:53,407
Mr. Chairman.

784
00:50:06,462 --> 00:50:08,464
Did you find out who framed me...

785
00:50:10,591 --> 00:50:11,675
for being a junkie?

786
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:16,263
Kang Taehoon, that rat,
is behind it for sure.

787
00:50:17,056 --> 00:50:18,891
But we don't have concrete evidence.

788
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:21,519
Yes, we do.

789
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:25,606
Kang Taehoon himself is concrete evidence.

790
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:28,651
How should I take him down?

791
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:37,159
Damn you.

792
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:04,603
Are you okay?

793
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:06,772
Excuse me.

794
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:14,405
Are you okay?

795
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,130
You lowered your guard.

796
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:34,091
If you lower your guard,

797
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:35,926
you're bound to lose.

798
00:51:46,895 --> 00:51:47,896
You came.

799
00:51:53,319 --> 00:51:56,322
This is because of
that damn Ashtray.

800
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:58,907
- Did you find her?
- No.

801
00:51:59,617 --> 00:52:00,618
Where's Halibut?

802
00:52:01,577 --> 00:52:02,745
I'll try calling him.

803
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:04,413
Gosh, this is so annoying.

804
00:52:06,707 --> 00:52:09,001
Please let go of me...

805
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:11,629
Hello.

806
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:14,715
What an outfit.

807
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:16,759
He's like that man
in the Rainy Bright card.

808
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:19,094
Hey, who are you?

809
00:52:19,178 --> 00:52:20,721
Seokkyung's cousin?

810
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:24,266
Is her entire family
a bunch of thugs?

811
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:25,351
I am...

812
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:28,937
What about that?

813
00:52:30,272 --> 00:52:31,273
Are you farsighted?

814
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:34,109
I'm a cop.

815
00:52:35,444 --> 00:52:36,737
It's nice to see you.

816
00:52:37,446 --> 00:52:38,989
You can consult an attorney.

817
00:52:39,073 --> 00:52:40,407
Detective!

818
00:52:40,491 --> 00:52:42,493
Please don't do this.

819
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,996
I'm doing all this for love.

820
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,331
Love, you know it, right?

821
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:52,795
I do. But I don't have to be arrested
because of love, do I?

822
00:52:56,924 --> 00:52:57,925
You think?

823
00:52:59,927 --> 00:53:01,011
Then,

824
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:04,807
should I give you a chance
out of the goodness of my heart?

825
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:06,100
Yes!

826
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:08,560
Okay.

827
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:10,938
Don't ever try
to contact Park Seokkyung again.

828
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:14,733
The 30 million won she owes you?
Consider it bad luck and forget about it.

829
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:16,610
Okay.

830
00:53:16,694 --> 00:53:21,156
And if Seokkyung ever happens to see
any of the jerks here,

831
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,492
feels like she's seen them,
or expects to see them,

832
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:25,077
you'll be arrested.

833
00:53:25,536 --> 00:53:26,537
Okay.

834
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:29,748
- If she gambles again, you'll be arrested.
- Okay.

835
00:53:29,832 --> 00:53:32,501
If she hurts her leg on the street,
catches a cold,

836
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:35,421
or suffers from a broken heart,
you'll be arrested. Do you understand?

837
00:53:36,422 --> 00:53:37,423
Yes!

838
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:39,758
You guys, answer him.

839
00:53:39,842 --> 00:53:40,843
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

840
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:43,137
That's nice and clear.
Let's clean it all up!

841
00:53:44,138 --> 00:53:47,516
Please uncuff me.

842
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:50,728
MYOUNGSAN INDUSTRIES

843
00:53:50,811 --> 00:53:53,105
Welcome back, sir!

844
00:53:58,485 --> 00:53:59,486
Ah, Seokcheol.

845
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:01,989
Tell the boys to buy some tofu...
Never mind.

846
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:04,658
- You know his favorite sushi place, right?
- Yes.

847
00:54:04,742 --> 00:54:06,827
Go get some, and two bottles of cold beer.

848
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:08,036
Wait here for a bit.

849
00:54:10,748 --> 00:54:11,999
Gosh.

850
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:26,346
How is the prep going?

851
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:28,599
Almost all the tables are taken.

852
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:30,309
You're so popular already!

853
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:35,189
By any chance,
did you save the table I asked for?

854
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:37,649
Who is it for that you care so much?
Your boyfriend?

855
00:54:38,442 --> 00:54:40,110
That man from the other day?

856
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:49,536
Over there, that is for your guest.

857
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:52,456
It's a VIP table,
and I've saved it.

858
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:13,060
<i>Sorry, I might be</i>
<i>a bit late today. Good luck.</i>

859
00:55:19,942 --> 00:55:20,943
SORRY, I MIGHT BE A BIT LATE TODAY.
GOOD LUCK.

860
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:23,570
Coming.

861
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:51,348
<i>The number you've dialed</i>
<i>is not available. Please leave--</i>

862
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:54,017
Try again.

863
00:55:55,269 --> 00:55:57,229
I might have to try it sometime later.
He wouldn't--

864
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:58,605
Keep trying, you idiot!

865
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:10,242
When we can't reach OSEON,
there has to be a reason.

866
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:11,660
So, try it again.

867
00:56:12,661 --> 00:56:13,662
Yes, sir.

868
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:21,920
<i>The number you've dialed is not available.</i>

869
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:25,340
What is it?

870
00:56:27,426 --> 00:56:28,802
It's a text message from OSEON.

871
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:31,805
- What does it say?
- That they won't work with us.

872
00:56:32,556 --> 00:56:34,224
Rumors have spread
because of the drug issue.

873
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:36,643
They say it's too risky.

874
00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:46,320
HWANG OF OSEON
SORRY, WE CAN'T WORK WITH YOU

875
00:56:52,034 --> 00:56:54,661
So, this was what Kang Taehoon was after.

876
00:56:59,583 --> 00:57:00,584
Mr. Chairman.

877
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:05,964
Should we set something up
to sucker-punch them too?

878
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:07,966
No.

879
00:57:08,884 --> 00:57:10,344
That's not how it should be done.

880
00:57:12,554 --> 00:57:15,432
One of us has to be gone once and for all

881
00:57:16,308 --> 00:57:17,476
for this to end.

882
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:24,733
Is Seokcheol outside?

883
00:57:29,363 --> 00:57:30,614
Mop the floor.

884
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:33,200
Keep things clean already. Tsk!

885
00:57:33,909 --> 00:57:35,035
Goodness.

886
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:46,880
SORRY, I MIGHT BE A BIT LATE TODAY.
GOOD LUCK.

887
00:57:48,632 --> 00:57:49,758
Is she busy?

888
00:57:50,509 --> 00:57:51,593
Seokcheol.

889
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:53,387
Yes, sir.

890
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,972
Come inside.
The Chairman wants to talk to you.
