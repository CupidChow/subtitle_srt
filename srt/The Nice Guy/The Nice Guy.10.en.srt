00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:42,960
The Nice Guy

2
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:45,295
THIS DRAMA SERIES IS FICTIONAL,
AND THE PERSONS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,

3
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:46,588
SETTINGS AND EVENTS DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
SERIES HAVE BEEN FICTIONALLY CREATED

4
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:47,756
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN SAFE CONDITIONS

5
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:48,966
WITH THE CONSENT OF
AND IN THE PRESENCE OF GUARDIANS

6
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:54,930
So you want to resign?

7
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:58,475
Yes.

8
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:01,353
I've made up my mind.

9
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:03,563
Please accept it, sir.

10
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,199
Must you leave?

11
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:16,994
Yes.

12
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:19,955
If you leave, I'll have

13
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:22,374
no one else to trust.

14
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:28,046
Sangyeol has much experience.
I'm sure he'll manage well.

15
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:30,507
Seokcheol.

16
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,388
Sangyeol isn't capable.

17
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:38,599
He lacks skills and brains.

18
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:41,518
He always gets ahead of himself.
He never does anything right.

19
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,147
Seokcheol,

20
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,024
I've always thought

21
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,985
that you were number two in this gang,

22
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:51,903
not Sangyeol.

23
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,872
I'll be honest with you.

24
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,457
I'm aged.

25
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:06,168
Mentally and physically,
I'm not like before.

26
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:09,254
I'm planning to step down and retire soon.

27
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:13,550
When I do,
I want you to take over the company.

28
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:19,431
I have zero intention of giving him
this gang I've dedicated my life to.

29
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,936
That's why I'm asking you.

30
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:27,939
Please.

31
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:31,943
I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman.

32
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:44,665
You may leave.

33
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,945
<i>I didn't realize it</i>
<i>until she died</i>

34
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,030
<i>that I didn't just lose my sister</i>

35
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:00,699
but my one...

36
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:04,077
and only family.

37
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:07,372
If someone had offered help at that time,

38
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,000
I wouldn't have thought twice.

39
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:13,879
Whoever it may have been,

40
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,007
I would've taken that offer.

41
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:29,978
SEOKCHEOL

42
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:37,444
Hello?

43
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:40,906
Oh.

44
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:42,991
It's okay. I'll be there.

45
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:56,004
- Seokcheol.
- Hey.

46
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,134
We've never been here at night,
haven't we?

47
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:02,886
Yes, it's nice here at night too.

48
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,852
- I have something to tell you.
- What is it?

49
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:15,899
Do you remember what I told you
when we first came here together?

50
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:21,238
I said I'd tell you
when I could be proud of it.

51
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:25,116
Well, it's not that I want to change.

52
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,160
I made up my mind on something.

53
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:28,745
You made up your mind on what?

54
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:31,790
Later.

55
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:34,125
I'll tell you when it's time.

56
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,002
What is it?

57
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:40,090
Is it something I can support?

58
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,884
Yes. Probably.

59
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:48,139
Then, whatever it may be,
tell me before all the others

60
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:49,474
once you get it done.

61
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:52,102
- Of course.
- Promise?

62
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,186
I promise.

63
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:55,647
- You promised.
- I did.

64
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:58,650
Oh, I remember.
I said I'd give you my support.

65
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:01,736
What is it?

66
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:05,490
I resigned today.

67
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:10,620
My sickening gangster life
is over for real.

68
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:19,379
It must've been tough.

69
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:23,508
Good job.

70
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,393


71
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:53,079
Want to stay for a while?

72
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,835
No, my sister's back.
I need to be home early.

73
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,420
You do? That's a shame.

74
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:01,504


75
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,758
- It's a shame. One moment.

76
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,509
Later. We'll have lots of time together.

77
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:09,346
- But it's a shame.
- Ah!

78
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,764
Hurry on before I change my mind.

79
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,223
Okay.

80
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:13,308
Go on inside.

81
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:14,517
Go in and sleep tight.

82
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:15,935
- Take care.
- Okay.

83
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:17,729
- Bye.
- Bye.

84
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:32,077
<i>We're gathered at Yeoljeong</i>
<i>for Younggi's birthday party.</i>

85
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,205
SON HEUNGMAN, MYOUNGSAN

86
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,394
<i>The number you dialed is unavailable...</i>

87
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,270
Why wouldn't he pick up?

88
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,871
Happy birthday, Younggi!

89
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:18,790
Happy birthday!

90
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:23,128
Bottoms up!

91
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,546
Cheers!

92
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:36,349
<i>Don't expect anything from me.</i>

93
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,102
<i>Nothing you expect is going to happen.</i>

94
00:08:58,121 --> 00:08:59,122
Hello, Mr. Chairman.

95
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,416
Are you ready?

96
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:05,295
Yes, sir.

97
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:08,298
Begin.

98
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,908
- Drink this.
- Yes, sir.

99
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,504
Those damn bastards!

100
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:52,592
Give the order.

101
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:53,676
Get them all!

102
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:41,432
Come here, you punk.

103
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,562
What are you doing there?

104
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:46,646
What are you doing?

105
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:49,399
Hey, I'm on your side. I'm on your side!

106
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,276
What are you saying?

107
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:06,583
Damn!

108
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,339
SON HEUNGMAN, MYOUNGSAN

109
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,582
SON HEUNGMAN, MYOUNGSAN

110
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,254
- What is it?
- <i>Sir.</i>

111
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:56,591
<i>We have a problem.</i>
<i>Taehoon's gang is raiding us in Yeoljeong.</i>

112
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,218
Please hurry here!

113
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,721
Heungman?

114
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,514
<i>What's wrong? Hello?</i>

115
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,351
Hello? Heungman...

116
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:22,927
The Nice Guy

117
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:28,266
Let's go.

118
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:30,018
Let's leave.

119
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,157
It's all over now.

120
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:25,656
Damn.

121
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,785
Are you okay, Seokcheol?

122
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,790
Stay down.

123
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,374
Your whole body is bruised.

124
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,418
Thank goodness it isn't worse.

125
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:38,961
It could've been horrible.

126
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:41,130
I had you admitted. Stay here for now.

127
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,508
Car accidents can leave lasting effects.

128
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:45,802
I don't need to be hospitalized.
I'll just leave.

129
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:48,596
- Seokhee.
- What?

130
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,974
Don't tell Miyoung about this, okay?

131
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:54,685
It's not the time
to worry about her.

132
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,481
Okay, fine.
I get it, so stay hospitalized.

133
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,622
Hey, are you okay?

134
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:17,917
First Seokhee, then Kihong, and now you?

135
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,127
You didn't have to come.

136
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,212
Then don't make me worry.

137
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:25,758
I just checked the CCTV footage.
It didn't seem like a simple hit-and-run.

138
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:27,844
The truck even had a fake license plate.

139
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,847
I even checked the traffic footage.
It tailed you from 10 minutes before.

140
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,224
It crashed into you on purpose, right?

141
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,019
Who did it?

142
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,899
I mean, you must have an idea.

143
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,609
Was it Kang Taehoon?

144
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,363
Forget it.

145
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,157
It's none of your business.

146
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,409
How is it not?

147
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,202
You could've died, punk!

148
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,875
They wouldn't have just left
if they wanted me dead.

149
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,086
Byeongsoo.

150
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,505
I resigned.

151
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:08,426
- Really?
- Yes.

152
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:11,679
So let's just call it a simple accident.

153
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,891
I don't want to get involved anymore.

154
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,396
You know what I mean, right?

155
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,399
Gosh, whatever. I don't know.

156
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,570
Thanks for coming.

157
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:29,906
Get going. Let me rest.

158
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:36,621
- Rest up.
- Bye.

159
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,468
I won't ask why.

160
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,475
Stop it here.

161
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:55,283
A FEW DAYS LATER

162
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:57,994


163
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:05,918
Mr. Chairman.

164
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:12,383
Hmm?

165
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:17,680
I'm impressed.

166
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:21,726
It's not easy to leave a gang.

167
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:28,274
Well, I'm sick and tired
of calculating and hesitating.

168
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:32,278
Good thinking.

169
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,574
What do I do from now on?

170
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,243
What?

171
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:42,913
You told me you wouldn't complain
if I worked here on the side.

172
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:46,292
Hire me. I need to make a living.

173
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:50,671
You sound like I owe you.

174
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:53,299
You do owe me.

175
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,051
Repay me for saving your life.

176
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:59,722
I'll shove you around. Is that okay?

177
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:03,059
Come on. Don't shove me around too much.

178
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,143
Go easy on me.

179
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,399
- Drink up. Let's go back to work.
- Okay.

180
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,071
Come here.

181
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:17,657
Go up there.

182
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,051
Is it doable?

183
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,637
It's not easy.

184
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:53,109
Seokcheol, I'm on my way to the café.
What about you?

185
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,528
<i>I'm working. I'm employed.</i>

186
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:56,821
You're employed?

187
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,949
Already? You resigned just a few days ago.

188
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:03,619
I can't stay jobless forever.
So I'm working.

189
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,371
It involves planting trees.

190
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:07,665
- Trees?
<i>- Yes, trees.</i>

191
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,835
Trees that provide you with shade
at all times.

192
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:14,755
But there are
too many trees here.

193
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:17,466
<i>Gosh, this means</i>
<i>you're now a man who plants trees,</i>

194
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,093
not a man who's like a tree.

195
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:22,179
That's funny.
Poet Park Seokcheol who plants trees.

196
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:26,726
But no job is easy after all. It's tough.

197
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:28,686
<i>You don't sound tired at all, though.</i>

198
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:32,440
You think?

199
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,233
You're right.

200
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:36,819
It's exhausting, but I'm at ease.

201
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,112
That's nice.

202
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:41,323
It sure gives you peace of mind
to have a decent job.

203
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:45,494
I'm going to learn and work hard.

204
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,538
Hey! Are you slacking off?

205
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:49,457
No work, no food!

206
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,833
I'm coming.

207
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,835
I have to go. Want to meet up later today?

208
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,462
<i>- Sure. Hurry on, Seokcheol.</i>
- Okay.

209
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:55,629
- Bye.
<i>- Bye.</i>

210
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:12,521
Why do you sleep here for days
instead of your house?

211
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:14,482
It's comfortable.

212
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:17,067
You cook for me,
and Seokkyung does the laundry.

213
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:20,029
Then just move back in.

214
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,782
I wouldn't like that. Where's Seokkyung?

215
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:24,867
She's taking her son to school.

216
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:25,951
Hey.

217
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:29,622
I told your father
about your studies abroad.

218
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:30,706
Oh.

219
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:32,917
What did he say?

220
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,002
He's outside. Ask him yourself.

221
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:37,087
I never know what he thinks.

222
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:59,318
Is it you, Tick?

223
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:01,570
Yes, hi.

224
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:04,031
I'm calling you

225
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:06,367
about the money I asked for before.

226
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,244
Let me borrow it.

227
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:11,539
Of course, I'll pay the interest.

228
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,333
Yes.

229
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:18,170
I'll text you the account number
as soon as I'm ready.

230
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:20,130
See you. Bye.

231
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,344
Dad.

232
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,847
Yes?

233
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,695
Your mom told me.

234
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:45,364
You want to go abroad to study.

235
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:47,575
Go.

236
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:51,787
Do what you want in life
before it's too late.

237
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:57,167
This is upsetting.

238
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:01,046
You're willing to send your daughter off
to live in the States.

239
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:03,591
If I tell you not to go, will you listen?

240
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:05,926
I know you.

241
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:09,305
You're just like me.

242
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:12,600
You've been stubborn
since you were a child.

243
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:15,686
You didn't shed a tear
even when you were caned.

244
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:18,647
I was just like you.

245
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:22,276
I wasn't satisfied
until I did what I wanted.

246
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:53,474
College, tuition, and visa...

247
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:58,479
Since you're thinking of a DNP degree,
you have emigration in mind, right?

248
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:02,316
<i>We have a tight contract schedule,</i>
<i>so you should decide soon.</i>

249
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:05,319
You're here a lot these days.

250
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:14,620
The other day,
you mentioned about 60 to 40.

251
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:16,205
Is it still the same?

252
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:19,375
It's not something that changes overnight.

253
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,880
Do you really want to become
a nurse in the States that much?

254
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:26,715
You really can't stand it here?

255
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,551
It's not that I want to run away
from the tough work here.

256
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:33,472
I want to study nursing
and achieve my dream. That's why.

257
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:37,476
You have no intention

258
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:39,770
of going with me anyway.

259
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:43,399
I want to go with you.
The situation doesn't allow me.

260
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:47,945
Right. I bet.

261
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:50,948
But I really want to go.

262
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:52,658
I don't want to be stuck here.

263
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:54,994
I want to change.

264
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:56,704
I want a different life from now.

265
00:24:58,414 --> 00:25:00,416
What about me then?

266
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:03,961
Are you okay with having a different life
without me?

267
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:05,796
We don't necessarily have to break up.

268
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:08,882
We won't be physically together,
but we can keep in touch.

269
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:12,094
And who knows?
I might think it's too hard and return.

270
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,973
If you'll come back that easily,
it's better not to go.

271
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:17,766
And that's not like you.

272
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:22,896
Seokhee.

273
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,900
I'm sorry to say this,

274
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:29,778
but I'm finally

275
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:32,573
and barely settling down now.

276
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:38,120
Dreams are important.
But reality can't be neglected.

277
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:40,914
What I do

278
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,709
isn't only for my sake.

279
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,754
If you leave for the States,

280
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:49,715
how will it turn out between us?

281
00:25:52,718 --> 00:25:53,719
Think carefully.

282
00:26:11,612 --> 00:26:12,780
Excuse me.

283
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,365
Hey.

284
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:18,452
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hello.

285
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:20,120
Who is he?

286
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:22,122
He's just a guy I know.

287
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:24,625
What are you doing here?

288
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:33,383
HAIR SALON

289
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:36,261
I need my hair to grow soon
so I can ask you for a haircut.

290
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:38,806
It looks fine right now.

291
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:40,933
I'll cut it nicely later.

292
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:44,436
Really? I'll try my best
to grow it quickly.

293
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:47,773
How's work?

294
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:50,234
It's okay.

295
00:26:51,068 --> 00:26:52,569
It's a job I used to have.

296
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:55,405
I like it
because it's near my son's school.

297
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:57,282
Hmm.

298
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:02,079
Then why the long face?

299
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:07,709
Life is just hard and helpless.

300
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:09,628
Why is life helpless?

301
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:13,298
- Byeongsoo.
- What?

302
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:15,259
You got some money?

303
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:16,718
Money? Well...

304
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:20,180
How much? I have a lot of money. Tell me.

305
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:23,100
You have 360 million won?

306
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:25,811
Three...

307
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:30,023
Why do you need 360 million won?

308
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:34,778
I borrowed some money
with my parents' house as collateral.

309
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:36,989
That's 360 million won.

310
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:41,493
I'm crazy, aren't I?

311
00:27:42,536 --> 00:27:45,747
That was why I ran away from home.
I got scared.

312
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:54,631
Well, it's okay. You're back now, right?

313
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:56,967
And you got a job.

314
00:27:57,050 --> 00:28:00,137
You can work to pay back eventually.
It's okay.

315
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,139
My parents' house will be auctioned soon.

316
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:04,725
I have no time to repay it.

317
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,188
I'll help you.

318
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:14,151
I've saved my paychecks,

319
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:16,695
and if I take out a loan,
it'll be around that much.

320
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:19,031
Are you insane?
Why would you take out a loan?

321
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:20,282
Forget it.

322
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,618
I'm just saying this out of frustration.

323
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:24,953
What's there to refuse it?

324
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:26,747
Seokcheol is my friend.

325
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:30,292
And most of all,
I can't watch you struggle like this.

326
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:34,546
Byeongsoo.

327
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:37,591
Stop giving me empty hope.

328
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:40,218
It's not empty hope. I'm serious.

329
00:28:40,302 --> 00:28:43,347
But I'm a total mess.
Just what do you like about me?

330
00:28:43,931 --> 00:28:46,391
I'm a divorced mother.

331
00:28:51,188 --> 00:28:54,608
To me, you are not a divorced mother.

332
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:56,693
You're a Myoungsan hottie.

333
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:58,862
You were this pretty girl
with good fighting skills

334
00:28:58,946 --> 00:28:59,947
who came to save me

335
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:02,532
whenever I got beaten up
by neighborhood bullies.

336
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:08,205
Even now, when I look at you,
you're like a high school girl.

337
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:12,542
You were once a high school girl
who saved me,

338
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,002
but now,

339
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:18,131
a high school girl
whom I feel like I should save.

340
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:23,011
I'm too old for that.

341
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:26,765
Don't worry. There should be a way.

342
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:31,228
Smile.

343
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:43,448
<i>Mr. Chairman.</i>

344
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:45,909
It's time to make a decision.

345
00:29:47,244 --> 00:29:51,248
Time's passing with no measures taken.
The boys are complaining a lot.

346
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:53,792
They're complaining
after getting beaten up?

347
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:56,795
Mr. Chairman.

348
00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:58,922
We must take revenge.

349
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:02,884
I'll make sure to gather the boys
and take down Taehoon's gang.

350
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:04,177
Leave this up to me.

351
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:06,513
We must not let it end like this.

352
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:08,515
For the great Myoungsan Industries' name.

353
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:09,599
Don't.

354
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:13,770
It's useless.

355
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:21,653
There was a king
who had everything he wanted.

356
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:25,449
When his death was near, he said,

357
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:29,536
"Vanity of vanities."

358
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:32,789
"Everything...

359
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:35,917
is vanity."

360
00:30:37,461 --> 00:30:38,462
Pardon?

361
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:42,549
Don't make a move
unless you have my order.

362
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:46,678
Anyway,

363
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:50,223
I'll try to take care of it.

364
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:53,602
Get some rest.

365
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:02,778
What is he mumbling about?
Is he going senile?

366
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:05,781
Is he intimidated or what?

367
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:07,824
Younggi, follow me.

368
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:12,704
- Close the door.
- Yes, sir.

369
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:14,956
Younggi.

370
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:20,504
Chairman Changsoo
is having a mental breakdown.

371
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:22,005
Oh Sangyeol is making a fuss

372
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:24,091
to gather the boys
and raid your gang right away.

373
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:28,970
Sangyeol is quite adorable.

374
00:31:30,097 --> 00:31:31,098
What about Seokcheol?

375
00:31:32,516 --> 00:31:35,727
Oh Sangyeol is very upset
about his resignation.

376
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:38,438
He probably
won't be able to leave peacefully.

377
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:44,236
Good job. This is for you.

378
00:31:47,114 --> 00:31:50,450
Thank you as always, sir.
I'll be in touch.

379
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:51,535
Okay.

380
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:12,013
Sir. Why are you this easy
on Park Seokcheol?

381
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:15,433
Isn't it better to finish him
once and for all?

382
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:17,477
He resigned.

383
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:19,646
There's no need to get blood on our hands.

384
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:21,940
Then are we done with him?

385
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:25,318
I'm not sure.

386
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:29,614
I don't think that's up to me.

387
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:52,596
<i>You're very much like a tree.</i>

388
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:54,347
Listen.

389
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:58,560
When I came back to this neighborhood,

390
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:02,480
I found you staying here
like a sturdy tree.

391
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:06,651
And you always give me good things,
like a tree.

392
00:33:07,277 --> 00:33:10,697
Whenever I need a place to rest or hide,

393
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:13,783
you provide me with a shade, like a tree.

394
00:33:16,203 --> 00:33:17,454
<i>So, you're like a tree.</i>

395
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:19,539
<i>Thank you.</i>

396
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:22,918
Gosh.

397
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:28,256
Your order is ready, thank you.

398
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:37,891
Hello?

399
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:39,935
Yes.

400
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:43,396
Yes.

401
00:33:44,648 --> 00:33:45,899
Okay.

402
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:48,026
Okay, bye.

403
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:14,594
She had a serious stomachache,
but she's gotten better.

404
00:34:14,678 --> 00:34:17,764
Earlier, she even had a high fever.

405
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:19,724
I'll tell you when she becomes worse.

406
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:22,394
You better get her checked out
at a big hospital.

407
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:23,812
I see.

408
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,320
What's wrong, Mom?

409
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:34,572
Do you feel like throwing up?

410
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:36,324
- Ma'am.
- What is it?

411
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:39,160
Mom. You have to breathe.

412
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:41,037
Come on. Mom.

413
00:34:41,121 --> 00:34:42,622
- Nod if it hurts.
- What's wrong?

414
00:34:42,706 --> 00:34:44,374
- Can't you breathe?
- What's going on?

415
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,210
Mom. You need to breathe.

416
00:34:47,294 --> 00:34:48,295
Call an ambulance first.

417
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:51,047
- Come on, Mom.
- What are you doing? Call an ambulance!

418
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:52,632
Okay.

419
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:55,176
Mom, breathe. Nod if it's painful.

420
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,429
No? You need to breathe.

421
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:04,728
THIS WAY TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM

422
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:22,245
Check her vitals
and give me 5L of oxygen.

423
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,415
- Are you her guardian?
- Yes.

424
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:27,459
Does she have any underlying conditions?

425
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:30,879
She has dementia,
and she's had a cold for days.

426
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:31,963
Right?

427
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:34,090
Yes.

428
00:35:34,174 --> 00:35:36,176
Please register the patient first, ma'am.

429
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:47,604
It's going to be okay. Don't worry.

430
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:51,608
It's all right.

431
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:54,569
It's going to be okay.

432
00:35:57,739 --> 00:36:00,283
- Miyoung.
- Oh, hey.

433
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:03,578
Your mother's condition has stabilized.
Don't worry.

434
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:06,706
Severe vomiting
caused food to enter her airway.

435
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:08,750
We're going to check
if her lungs are okay.

436
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:11,169
- She'll be okay.
- Thanks.

437
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:12,837
Please take good care of her.

438
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:14,631
Wait.

439
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,467
Wait. Seokhee?

440
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:21,763
Taehoon, right?

441
00:36:23,807 --> 00:36:24,974
Oh, you work here?

442
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:27,894
- How have you been?
- Good.

443
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:29,979
Anyway, what are you doing here?

444
00:36:30,647 --> 00:36:31,648
Me?

445
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,069
Miyoung and I

446
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:38,738
know each other.

447
00:36:44,411 --> 00:36:45,412
Let's go, Seokhee.

448
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:47,789
- Help me register my mom.
- Oh, okay.

449
00:36:48,498 --> 00:36:49,499
Let's go.

450
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:50,875
Taehoon, I'll see you again.

451
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:54,504
You must've been startled.

452
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:56,923
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

453
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:58,341
- Thanks.
- No problem.

454
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:05,515
WARD 22, NURSE STATION

455
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:07,392
It's aspiration pneumonia.

456
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:09,811
It's a dangerous symptom
for a dementia patient

457
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,187
who has difficulty swallowing.

458
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:14,566
And about her stomachache,
it appears to be acute cholecystitis.

459
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:19,112
An immediate operation would be best
but she's not in good physical condition.

460
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:22,532
Let's decide on this
once she's stabilized.

461
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:24,409
Okay, thank you.

462
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:33,126
She'll be okay. Let's wait and see.

463
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:37,672
I wonder why this keeps happening.

464
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,633
Last time, it was my brother.
Now, your mother.

465
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:43,428
Your brother? What about him?

466
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,224
A few days ago,

467
00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:50,518
he got into an accident
and came to the ER.

468
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:53,313
- What?
- It wasn't a serious injury.

469
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:55,440
But...

470
00:37:57,734 --> 00:37:58,735
But what?

471
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:02,238
Byeongsoo was worried.

472
00:38:02,322 --> 00:38:06,409
He thinks it's not just a simple accident
but an intentional one.

473
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:09,078
We aren't sure yet.

474
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:11,581
The police suspect
it's a hit-and-run case.

475
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:14,918
It might be just an accident.

476
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:25,512
Miyoung.

477
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:30,517
- The bill is fully paid, right?
- Yes, it's all taken care of.

478
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:41,069
Wait. I need to talk to you.

479
00:38:41,778 --> 00:38:43,029
Oh, do you need anything?

480
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:45,406
Is it your doing?

481
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:47,242
Excuse me?

482
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:50,954
Are you the one
behind Seokcheol's accident?

483
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,083
Well...

484
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:59,379
I'm not sure
if it's necessary to talk about it now,

485
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:01,714
but yes.

486
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:03,842
I am behind it.

487
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:08,638
Don't get the wrong idea.
It's not because of you.

488
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:09,722
It's just...

489
00:39:10,932 --> 00:39:13,935
...between me and Seokcheol.

490
00:39:15,228 --> 00:39:16,229
What...

491
00:39:18,565 --> 00:39:20,400
Just why must you do this much?

492
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:22,902
I don't know.

493
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:25,947
I can't understand myself

494
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:29,951
and why I'm taking it this far with him.

495
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,580
I may have feelings...

496
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:37,333
for you.

497
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:41,129
- Do you even hear--
- Miyoung.

498
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,301
You need someone who can support you.

499
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:48,803
Do you get what I mean?

500
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:51,055
Let him go.

501
00:39:51,848 --> 00:39:53,600
Don't hold onto him, let go.

502
00:39:56,019 --> 00:39:57,395
What if I don't?

503
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:02,567
Then everything will be a mess.

504
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:07,155
You'll resent me, and I'll regret it.

505
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,239
It will just...

506
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:10,992
all be over like that.

507
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:16,414
Break up...

508
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:18,833
with Seokcheol.

509
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:23,671
Then at least
he won't get hurt because of me.

510
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,551
I promise.

511
00:41:03,503 --> 00:41:05,088
LIGHT-HEARTED PEOPLE

512
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:08,132
Hello?

513
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:10,843
- <i>Do you have time to talk?</i>
- Yes, go on.

514
00:41:10,927 --> 00:41:13,012
Miyoung came to the ER

515
00:41:13,096 --> 00:41:15,264
because of her mother today.

516
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:17,600
Did she?

517
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,519
Is she in a bad condition?

518
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:22,146
Yes, she suffered from pneumonia for days
before coming.

519
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:24,315
Dang, I see.

520
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:29,737
Look. Don't take this the wrong way, okay?

521
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:31,322
Okay.

522
00:41:31,406 --> 00:41:34,158
Miyoung came with Taehoon.

523
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:40,581
- Kang Taehoon?
<i>- Yes.</i>

524
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:43,001
<i>I didn't have a good feeling about it.</i>

525
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:45,253
They didn't seem like
simple acquaintances.

526
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:48,673
It turned out
he even paid for the hospital bill.

527
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:53,970
- Okay.
<i>- Seokcheol.</i>

528
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:03,312
I hope I'm not doing anything wrong.

529
00:42:18,828 --> 00:42:19,829
<i>How are you feeling?</i>

530
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:24,125
You should've gone through with it.

531
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:26,627
<i>Taehoon.</i>

532
00:42:27,462 --> 00:42:29,255
Stay away from Miyoung.

533
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:31,924
<i>I just happened to be where you weren't.</i>

534
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:33,301
I just did

535
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:35,928
what you couldn't do for her.

536
00:42:40,141 --> 00:42:42,643
Don't do anything.

537
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:08,753
<i>Miyoung.</i>

538
00:43:09,629 --> 00:43:10,630
Let him go.

539
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:13,132
Don't hold onto him, let go.

540
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:15,760
What if I don't?

541
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:18,429
Then everything will be a mess.

542
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:22,350
You'll resent me, and I'll regret it.

543
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:23,768
It will just...

544
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:26,020
<i>all be over like that.</i>

545
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:32,902
Miyoung.

546
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:34,195
Seokcheol?

547
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:44,789
YOON HYESOOK, 55, FEMALE

548
00:43:51,796 --> 00:43:54,507
I'll stay while you go out for some air.

549
00:43:59,095 --> 00:44:02,098
It must be hard for your mother,
but also for you.

550
00:44:19,699 --> 00:44:21,951
Go back in. I can leave on my own.

551
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:27,290
- Seokcheol.
- Yes?

552
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:30,376
Are you okay?

553
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:33,045
Me?

554
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,798
Of course, I am. Why do you ask?

555
00:44:38,718 --> 00:44:40,845
Nothing. Take care.

556
00:44:42,555 --> 00:44:44,473
Okay, cheer up.

557
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:48,686
Bye.

558
00:44:52,899 --> 00:44:55,443
<i>The doors are closing.</i>

559
00:45:36,484 --> 00:45:38,861
Dad.

560
00:45:38,945 --> 00:45:41,572
What are you doing?
You're a grown-up woman.

561
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:44,200
You must be going through a lot.

562
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:08,307
GEUMMYEONG BANK

563
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:28,911
<i>How's your mother?</i>

564
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:41,465
<i>I can't reach you.</i>
<i>Call me when you read this.</i>

565
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:25,509
<i>I don't regret it.</i>

566
00:47:26,427 --> 00:47:27,678
You got hurt.

567
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:30,222
They broke your heart.

568
00:47:32,141 --> 00:47:34,143
If anyone tries to harass you again,

569
00:47:35,061 --> 00:47:36,354
<i>I'll do the same.</i>

570
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:53,037
<i>Break up with Seokcheol.</i>

571
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:57,041
Then at least
he won't get hurt because of me.

572
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:00,961
I promise.

573
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,703
CALL ME WHEN YOU READ THIS.

574
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:16,328
Good-bye.

575
00:49:22,251 --> 00:49:23,752
- Hello.
- Hello.

576
00:49:23,836 --> 00:49:25,045
How may I help you?

577
00:49:25,129 --> 00:49:27,256
I'm here to close
my installment savings account.

578
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:29,508
- I see. Your ID, please.
- Okay.

579
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,513
One moment, please.

580
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:39,018
Ms. Park Seokhee.

581
00:49:40,269 --> 00:49:42,855
Are you sure you want to close it?

582
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:47,234
The amount will become 100 million won
including the interest after 10 months.

583
00:49:47,318 --> 00:49:49,737
Well, I still want to do it.

584
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:52,364
I see. Sure, I'll close it for you.

585
00:49:52,448 --> 00:49:53,574
Thank you.

586
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:10,257
HOSPITAL DIRECTOR
DR. NAM JUNU

587
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:18,933
Hello, Dr. Jang.

588
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:21,393
Did I make you wait long?

589
00:50:21,477 --> 00:50:23,229
No, sir. I just came here.

590
00:50:24,605 --> 00:50:25,773
<i>My daughter told me</i>

591
00:50:26,524 --> 00:50:28,734
that you have a girlfriend.

592
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:32,404
Well, the thing is...

593
00:50:32,488 --> 00:50:35,407
- Yes, I do. I'm sorry.
- It's nothing to be sorry for.

594
00:50:36,075 --> 00:50:38,369
You're decent enough to have a girlfriend.

595
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:41,372
- It's all right.
- Thank you for understanding.

596
00:50:42,248 --> 00:50:44,458
So, how's your girlfriend's family?

597
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:46,126
Pardon?

598
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:48,462
Are they capable of helping you?

599
00:50:50,214 --> 00:50:52,091
If not, break up with her on a good note.

600
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:55,928
This is my advice for you
as someone with more experience in life.

601
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:57,805
Speaking of which,

602
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:00,432
you and I have a lot to do
in this hospital.

603
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:03,060
Once you become an associate professor,

604
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:05,104
I'll support you
to become a full professor.

605
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:07,565
What's there to think about?

606
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:10,568
A man shouldn't be too hung up on a fling,

607
00:51:10,651 --> 00:51:12,403
or he can't do anything great.

608
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:35,384
<i>Lower!</i>

609
00:51:35,467 --> 00:51:36,468
Lower.

610
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:38,345
Keep going!

611
00:51:38,721 --> 00:51:39,722
Keep going!

612
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:43,058
Lower!

613
00:51:43,142 --> 00:51:44,184
Now, stop!

614
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:46,854
All right. Now, lift it up!

615
00:51:55,571 --> 00:51:56,572
- Let me see.
- Okay.

616
00:51:58,365 --> 00:52:00,284
Gosh, the dust.

617
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:02,745
Take off! Drive safely.

618
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:04,830
Those in the way, move aside.

619
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:06,123
It's dangerous.

620
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:10,169
I CAN'T REACH YOU.
CALL ME WHEN YOU READ THIS.

621
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:17,217
Good job.

622
00:52:17,301 --> 00:52:18,344
You too.

623
00:52:18,427 --> 00:52:20,846
My wife made noodles.
Have some before you leave work.

624
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:23,432
No, I'll just leave work today.

625
00:52:23,515 --> 00:52:24,683
I have something to do.

626
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:26,226
See you.

627
00:52:27,311 --> 00:52:28,771
- Good work.
- You too.

628
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,401
Mom.

629
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:38,155
I'll miss him a lot, won't I?

630
00:52:40,658 --> 00:52:43,410
We'll probably never
run into each other again, will we?

631
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:47,623
That will be so hard.

632
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:52,336
I don't know what to do, Mom.

633
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,774
SEOKCHEOL

634
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:03,133
Miyoung.

635
00:55:04,343 --> 00:55:05,552
<i>Miyoung.</i>

636
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:53,058
CEO KANG TAEHOON

637
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:06,196
Hello?

638
00:56:10,826 --> 00:56:11,827
I see.

639
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:15,706
I'll keep the promise I made.

640
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:44,735
Miyoung.

641
00:56:45,319 --> 00:56:46,486
<i>Seokcheol.</i>

642
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:47,654
Gosh.

643
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:50,282
What's going on?
You didn't even answer your phone.

644
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:51,908
Where are you?

645
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:54,411
<i>I'm with my mom at the hospital.</i>

646
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:56,413
Oh.

647
00:56:56,955 --> 00:56:57,956
I see.

648
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:02,127
<i>I was worried</i>
<i>because I couldn't reach you.</i>

649
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:06,423
She'll be operated on soon.

650
00:57:07,132 --> 00:57:08,300
Don't worry.

651
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:11,928
I'm sorry for your trouble.

652
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:14,431
It must be hard on you.

653
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:18,268
I'm sorry.

654
00:57:18,352 --> 00:57:20,687
Don't be. Your mother is sick.

655
00:57:20,771 --> 00:57:21,980
It's okay. Don't bother.

656
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:29,863
Can we meet up for a moment?

657
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:32,908
You want to?
Then I'll go to the hospital now.

658
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:35,369
No. Well...

659
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:38,497
Let's meet at the park we often go to.

660
00:57:39,373 --> 00:57:40,374
Sure.

661
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:42,459
Okay, I'll meet you there.

662
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:10,904
Miyoung.

663
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:19,204
Gosh, you became haggard
in just a few days.

664
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:22,457
Did you eat?

665
00:58:23,083 --> 00:58:26,002
You hardly eat these days, right?
Let's go eat something first.

666
00:58:31,633 --> 00:58:33,260
What is it? Aren't you hungry?

667
00:58:35,804 --> 00:58:37,305
I have something to tell you.

668
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:39,516
Go on.

669
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:47,357
I want us to break up.

670
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:39,951
The Nice Guy

671
00:59:40,744 --> 00:59:41,870
<i>Must you do this?</i>

672
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:46,541
<i>It's because of me.</i>

673
00:59:46,625 --> 00:59:49,044
<i>My current situation</i>
<i>is too much to handle.</i>

674
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:55,217
<i>Get yourself together,</i>
<i>don't skip meals, and don't be sick.</i>

675
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:57,844
Do you like Miyoung?

676
00:59:58,428 --> 00:59:59,429
Can't I?

677
00:59:59,513 --> 01:00:02,974
Are you really going to kill me
over a woman?

678
01:00:03,058 --> 01:00:05,185
<i>Your mother</i>
<i>is in a critical situation.</i>

679
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:06,645
<i>She's undergoing emergency surgery.</i>

680
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:10,190
To Myoungsan Hospital, please.

681
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:13,652


682
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:15,445
No...

683
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:17,364
Mom, no.

684
01:00:18,406 --> 01:00:21,993
<i>I'll make sure to hold</i>
<i>a memorial service for you each year.</i>

685
01:00:22,536 --> 01:00:23,537
<i>Go on and die.</i>

686
01:00:24,538 --> 01:00:26,498
You may end up getting hurt, Seokcheol.

687
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:30,085
<i>Sangyeol wants</i>
<i>to bring you over.</i>

688
01:00:31,002 --> 01:00:33,505
<i>Are you really going to resign?</i>

689
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:34,840


690
01:00:34,923 --> 01:00:37,342
<i>If you take it back,</i>

691
01:00:37,926 --> 01:00:40,971
<i>I'll quietly let it slide.</i>

692
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:43,306


693
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:45,851
<i>After all, I saw this coming.</i>

694
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:47,769
<i>I knew I'd hesitate</i>

695
01:00:49,229 --> 01:00:51,106
<i>and end up like this.</i>
