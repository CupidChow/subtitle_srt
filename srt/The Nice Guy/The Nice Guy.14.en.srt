00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:42,960
The Nice Guy

2
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:45,170
THIS DRAMA SERIES IS FICTIONAL,
AND THE PERSONS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,

3
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:46,463
SETTINGS AND EVENTS DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
SERIES HAVE BEEN FICTIONALLY CREATED

4
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:47,631
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN SAFE CONDITIONS

5
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:48,799
WITH THE CONSENT OF
AND IN THE PRESENCE OF GUARDIANS

6
00:00:57,933 --> 00:00:59,935
Damn them.

7
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,733
Gosh, that startled me.

8
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:09,069
Great timing.

9
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:14,366
PARK SEOKCHEOL, MYOUNGSAN

10
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:18,579
Hi, Seokcheol. It's been a while.

11
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:20,747
<i>I know.</i>

12
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:22,040
Are you feeling all right?

13
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,543
I'm okay now.

14
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:26,670
<i>I see. That's good news.</i>

15
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:29,756
So, what are you calling me for?

16
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,050
Oh.

17
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:35,178
I have to ask you something.

18
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,097
Go on.

19
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:48,358
Why did you do that to me?

20
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:50,736
Do what, you punk?

21
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:55,699
Why did you try to kill me?

22
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:03,540
What are you suddenly talking about?
Why would I do that?

23
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:07,002
<i>You're one ridiculous punk.</i>
<i>Have you lost your mind?</i>

24
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,046
Why would I try to kill you?

25
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:13,008
You threatened Wooseok
into trying to kill me.

26
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:19,598
And you killed Wooseok.

27
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:22,392
What?

28
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,770
Who's Wooseok?

29
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:27,189
What are you saying?

30
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,068
Don't feign ignorance.

31
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:34,988
Jeez, I'm busy as hell.

32
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:37,741
Stop talking nonsense,
or just hang up, you punk.

33
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:43,789
Turn yourself in.

34
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:44,873
<i>What?</i>

35
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:47,542
Turn yourself in.

36
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:52,214
This is insane.

37
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:55,342
Wake up, Seokcheol.

38
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,972
You leave me no choice
but to drag you to the police then.

39
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:02,724
Oh, really?

40
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:04,267
Suit yourself.

41
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:06,478
Oh, right.

42
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:09,272
Is your father doing well?

43
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:12,192
<i>Don't waste your energy on useless things,</i>

44
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:13,777
and just be a good son.

45
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:15,612
Understand?

46
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,031
<i>Alright, bye.</i>

47
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:14,796
What the heck?

48
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:13,855
How did it go?

49
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:15,065
I've checked.

50
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:18,360
The footage is intact,
it's clear and of good quality.

51
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,322
Good job.

52
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:24,115
Thank you.

53
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:26,785
Anyway, what are your plans?

54
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:29,037
Will you go straight to the police
with it?

55
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,837
Well done. You may go home now.

56
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:40,924
Sure.

57
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:43,677
- Dusik.
- Yes?

58
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,389
I know it's hard,
but you really have to quit gambling.

59
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:51,601
- I'll try.
- You're all talk.

60
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,521
Take care.

61
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:56,314
I will.

62
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:58,775
- Take care, sir.
- Okay.

63
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:17,919
SAMJUN E&C

64
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:29,389
<i>Stay out of it.</i>

65
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,725
I'll take care of him my way.

66
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,018
Your way?

67
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:34,644
How?

68
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,147
You can't go talk him out of it alone.

69
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,232
You idiot, do you still not get it?

70
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:41,693
That doesn't work
for that scumbag Sangyeol!

71
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:48,950
He hurt someone else too.

72
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:51,161
He killed a boy.

73
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,329
A high school boy.

74
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:54,539
Taehoon,

75
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,709
our lives may be messed up,

76
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,337
but some things must not be done.

77
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:02,756
<i>I've got this.</i>

78
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:07,927
He always has his way.

79
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:17,604
What about Oh Sangyeol?

80
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,232
He has five to six men tag along
wherever he goes.

81
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:23,526
It's not easy to take him down.

82
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:27,530
He's caused such a mess
for the coward that he is.

83
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,449
We have no time.

84
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:31,785
Let's get it done quickly.

85
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:33,787
Yes, sir.

86
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:44,673


87
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,010
Is the volume okay?

88
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:51,930
Isn't it too loud?

89
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:54,974
Because of the speaker...

90
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:03,900
Seokcheol.

91
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,118
How's the practice going?

92
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:15,829
I've performed with them before,
so it's going smoothly.

93
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:16,913
I just have to do well.

94
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:21,501
We're performing somewhere
quite famous in the indie music field.

95
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,044
I feel a lot of pressure.

96
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:27,132
You'll do well.

97
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:29,426
You'll come, right?

98
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:32,303
Of course, I will.

99
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:36,433
When I met you again,

100
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,185
I was too timid to sing
even a single song around others.

101
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:43,314
I still imagine
I'm singing in front of you

102
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:44,983
when I sing in front of others.

103
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:47,444
"Let's sing just for one person."

104
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,154
"Let's sing just for Seokcheol."

105
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,655
I perform with this in mind.

106
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:54,617
It gets easier to sing that way.

107
00:08:57,454 --> 00:09:00,415
Oh, right. When are you going to finish
writing the lyrics?

108
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,251
Oh.

109
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,505
I'll try to get it done
as soon as possible.

110
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,299
Make sure you do it, okay?

111
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,884
- Okay.
- For sure.

112
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,307
- I better get going.
- Okay.

113
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,685
- Miyoung.
- Yes?

114
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:41,956
You can do it.

115
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:44,084
- See you.
- Bye.

116
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:48,338
Bye.

117
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:09,734
The Nice Guy

118
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:18,535
Hyeonggeun, stop running.

119
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:23,414
We have lots to eat at home.
Why waste money on this?

120
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:25,959
Seokcheol booked it for us,
so let's just enjoy eating.

121
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,336
- This must be it. Yes.
- Here? Let's go.

122
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:29,838
Let's go.

123
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,009
I see you like it. Good.

124
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:37,512
I just wanted us to eat together at ease.

125
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,849
You and Seokkyung
must be tired of cooking every day.

126
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:45,186
Father and I do nothing but eat
what you make. I felt bad.

127
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:47,730
You're acting strange today.

128
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:51,151
You know what? Gender doesn't matter
when it comes to house chores anymore.

129
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:55,196
- Help out from now on.
- Of course.

130
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:00,702
Father, you too.

131
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:02,412
Okay?

132
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:05,623
Why not?

133
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:09,127
That's unusual of you.

134
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,797
Seokkyung, I guess we'll have
less work to do at home.

135
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:15,133
This is surprising.

136
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,426
I know.

137
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:19,262
I wish Seokhee were here too.

138
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,847
She has no luck with food.

139
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:24,851
Hyeonggeun, is it yummy?

140
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,315
How unusual.

141
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,865
- It's free food.
- Eat as you drink.

142
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,366
You don't want to hurt your stomach.

143
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:46,122
Is it good?

144
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,166
- Eat up.
- It's good, Uncle.

145
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:52,212
This is on your uncle.
Eat up.

146
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:55,506
It's delicious.

147
00:11:58,176 --> 00:11:59,302
I like the food here.

148
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:01,596
It's good.

149
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:30,333
<i>Please insert an SD card.</i>

150
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,761
Wait. Where did it go?

151
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:53,856
- Younggi.
- What is it, sir?

152
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:56,943
Did you do something with my dash cam?

153
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,861
No, sir.

154
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:01,948
What about the dash cam in your car?

155
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,617
Pardon? I don't understand.

156
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:07,245
You punk, that day when Wooseok...

157
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,540
The footage
from the day we killed Wooseok,

158
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:11,708
what did you do with it?

159
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:15,503
Oh, I deleted the one in my dashcam
just in case.

160
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,176
What the heck?

161
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:32,603
<i>Why did you do that to me?</i>

162
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:34,689
Do what, you punk?

163
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,066
<i>Why did you try to kill me?</i>

164
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:43,406
What are you suddenly talking about?
Why would I do that?

165
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,491
You're one ridiculous punk.

166
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:47,368
<i>Have you lost your mind?</i>

167
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:50,121
You threatened Wooseok
into trying to kill me.

168
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,752
And you killed Wooseok.

169
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,338
Damn it.

170
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:38,127
IN THE POSSIBLE FUTURE...

171
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,192
Come on out.

172
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:45,820
How strange.

173
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,864
Why can't a woman
be a car dealer?

174
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,365
No one is against it. Come.

175
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,325
What if they turn me down?

176
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:52,743
They won't, come on.

177
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:55,872
- Here?
- Yes.

178
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,291
Hello.

179
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:02,628
Hello.

180
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:03,838
Haeseong Motor Inc

181
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:10,511
- Oh, yes.
- Yes.

182
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:11,679
Thank you.

183
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,264
- Here.
- Thank you.

184
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:18,144
A lot of women
have gotten into this field lately.

185
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:21,480
- Ah.
- Car sales is hard at first,

186
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:23,733
but it becomes doable
once you're settled in.

187
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,235
- I see.
- What was your previous job?

188
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,863
I used to be Ashtray...

189
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:35,119
Well, I mean, it was kind of like
a customer service job.

190
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:38,039
I see. You mainly dealt with customers.

191
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:42,210
Yes, right. I served and responded
to people from various occupations.

192
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:44,378
That's great.

193
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:48,841
You see, working in this industry
requires you to meet all kinds of people.

194
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:50,801
I see, all kinds of people.

195
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:52,303
I can deal with such people.

196
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:58,434
Right, she's got experience
in various social settings.

197
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:01,187
You give me the impression
that you'll do quite well.

198
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,647
You look good-natured.

199
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:03,731
Good-natured?

200
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,276
Well, I get that a lot.

201
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,238
You're easygoing and friendly.

202
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:13,950
Just treat customers with honesty,
and you'll make it big.

203
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,034
I see.

204
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:24,293
Hey,
I have a good feeling about this.

205
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,963
- Do you think I'll do well?
- Of course.

206
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:40,017
You look beautiful.

207
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,481
So beautiful.

208
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:49,193
You look pretty cool too.

209
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:55,533
It's pretty, but isn't it a bit too soon?

210
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,618
We haven't even set the date yet.

211
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:00,246
Seokhee,

212
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:03,040
we have to hold the wedding
before leaving.

213
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:04,625
Our parents are here.

214
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,627
We shouldn't do it in the US.

215
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,338
Gosh.

216
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:10,548
Come here.

217
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:14,885
It looks so good on you.

218
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:18,055
Of all that you've worn,
this one suits you the best.

219
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:22,643
Kihong, we're actually getting married.

220
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,319
I love you.

221
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:35,323
Come here.

222
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:37,033
What is it?

223
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:39,785
What are you doing?

224
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:48,127
Why isn't it working? Jeez.

225
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,553
I'll make your life full of happiness.

226
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:58,638
What?

227
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:01,974
What is this?

228
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:04,310
What on earth is this?

229
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,816
Wait, what...

230
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,111
Seokkyung, I...

231
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:17,698
I've saved my paycheck each month
for 10 years in this bankbook.

232
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:19,909
- Will you marry me?
- Hey, wait.

233
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,619
Hold up a second.

234
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:34,298
Byeongsoo, who offers his bankbook
when he proposes to someone?

235
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:35,883
I'll get you

236
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:39,720
a ring with a giant diamond
after we pay off the debt.

237
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:42,014
Please accept it.

238
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:45,518
I mean, who proposes to someone
at a secondhand-car market?

239
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,645
All these secondhand cars
are glaring at you.

240
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,689
I feel too embarrassed to say yes.

241
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:50,773
Not today.

242
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,608
You took it. You have to marry me.

243
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:53,818
No, maybe another time.

244
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,653
- You thief!
- What?

245
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:56,862
You stole my heart!

246
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:58,280
What are you saying?

247
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:58,591
THE LATE YOON HYESOOK

248
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:35,294

<i>Where are you? Are you coming?</i>

250
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,969
You're up next.
Please get ready right away.

251
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:45,095
Sure.

252
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:07,034
We'll begin.

253
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:33,894
♪ <i>Without any preparations ♪</i>

254
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:36,564

255
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,247
Are you on your way?

256
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:54,874
<i>Yes.</i>

257
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,501
Must you do this?

258
00:23:00,254 --> 00:23:01,297
Taehoon,

259
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:04,592
I'm not off to die or anything,
but I feel strange.

260
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:07,344
That's because you're doing
something unnecessary.

261
00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:09,263
You aren't a detective after a criminal.

262
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,600
<i>It's not too late to turn around.</i>
<i>Don't be stubborn.</i>

263
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:14,351
Oh Sangyeol won't listen to you.

264
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,605
Don't waste your life over scum like him.

265
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:21,734
I'd like the rest of my life
to be meaningful at least.

266
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,153
That's why I'm doing this.

267
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:29,199
Seokcheol,

268
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:32,369
at the crossroads...

269
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,957
you don't always have to make a choice.

270
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,170
You can also choose to turn back.

271
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,342
I've come too far to turn back.

272
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:49,386
I'm hanging up.

273
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:03,609
He's so stubborn.

274
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,581
Thank you.

275
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:19,625
Let's move onto the next song.

276
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:22,294
Someone I love wrote the lyrics to it.

277
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:24,171
Ooh!

278
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:26,632
And I wrote the song myself.

279
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,342
To be precise,

280
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:32,638
I gave a melody to the love letter
I received a long time ago.

281
00:24:34,932 --> 00:24:37,184
It's called <i>The Story I Want to Hear.</i>

282
00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:51,907
<i>- ♪ Tell me your own story ♪</i>

283

MYOUNGSAN POLICE STATION

292
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:31,613
Hey, who brought this in?

293
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:37,036
Come in.

294
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:48,213
What is this?

295
00:25:48,756 --> 00:25:51,008
Jang Wooseok's death wasn't an accident.

296
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:53,469
As you can see, it was Sangyeol's doing.

297
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:55,429
Are you turning yourself in?

298
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,223
No, I have nothing to do with it.

299
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:00,559
- I was just told to deliver it.
- By whom?

300
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:05,606
Well, Mr. Seokcheol asked me
to deliver it to you.

301
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:07,649
- Seokcheol?
- Yes.

302
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:11,487
Where is he?

303
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:13,655
Where is he, you punk?

304
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,000
Sir, where are you going?

305
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:27,836
- Move or you'll get hurt.
- Pardon? Sir.

306
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,047
Sir, this will only make things worse--

307
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,551
MYOUNGSAN INDUSTRIES

308
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,141
Damn it.

309
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:43,352
Sir. Sir!

310
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:48,941
Damn it.

311
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:55,030
I'm glad you came at the perfect time.

312
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,741
Did you take the dash cam footage?

313
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:02,246
If you want to know,
go turn yourself in with me.

314
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:04,832
Then, you'll be convicted,
and I'll have a happy ending.

315
00:27:04,915 --> 00:27:06,208
What are you saying?

316
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:08,043
Did you come here alone?

317
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:12,172
I'm not here to fight.
I have no energy for it.

318
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,257
Let's just go.

319
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,967
And what if I refuse?

320
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:18,053
I'll drag you there.

321
00:27:18,846 --> 00:27:20,597
What are you saying?

322
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:23,267
What are you waiting for?

323
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,351
Get him.

324
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,646
I have nothing against you guys.

325
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:29,189
Just back off and leave.

326
00:27:31,275 --> 00:27:32,276
Damn it.

327
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:45,289
I said I had no business with you guys.

328
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:46,874
Sir.

329
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:49,459
Let's just go. I have no time.

330
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,378
You crazy...

331
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:55,173
What can you possibly do alone?

332
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:57,634
You know, that's your problem.

333
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,846
You keep acting noble.

334
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:05,100
You're a thug, so act like one

335
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:09,396
instead of playing the damn hero,
you punk.

336
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,691
What are you waiting for?

337
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:16,403
What are you doing, punks?

338
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:23,827
I knew it.

339
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:27,122
I regretted it even on my way here.

340
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,498
I knew this would happen.

341
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:37,007
What the heck?

342
00:28:43,764 --> 00:28:45,682
Seokcheol! Park Seokcheol!

343
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:47,893
Gosh, you ended up coming.

344
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,645
You really get on my nerves.

345
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,442
- Oh Sangyeol!
- Damn it.

346
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:43,198
Sir! Mr. Seokcheol went after Oh Sangyeol.

347
00:29:45,242 --> 00:29:46,493
Leave him be.

348
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:48,078
Finish things out here first.

349
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:58,296
Damn it.

350
00:30:17,024 --> 00:30:19,067
Hey, Seokcheol. Calm down.

351
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,236
Calm down, you bastard.

352
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:23,530
Let's talk it out, huh?

353
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:25,323
I'm busy. Come on, let's go.

354
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:27,409
Go where, you punk?

355
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:31,121
You need to pay the price.

356
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:32,831
And I'll go my way.

357
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:35,292
Just what did that damn kiddo
have to do with you?

358
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:37,127
He meant nothing to you!

359
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:40,422
That boy?

360
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:44,051
He was a high schooler with a single mom

361
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:46,053
who had a foolish dream
of becoming a thug.

362
00:30:46,595 --> 00:30:48,263
Are you kidding me?

363
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:49,681
Look, you punk.

364
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:51,767
You can't clean up after others forever.

365
00:30:52,476 --> 00:30:54,144
You like that? You think it's cool?

366
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:57,522
I'll never go to prison alone.

367
00:30:57,606 --> 00:31:00,650
I'll make sure to drag you with me.

368
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:02,736
You were a part of this gang.

369
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:04,738
We'll go to prison together!

370
00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:08,366
That's exactly what I hated.

371
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:11,787
That I was no different
from the likes of you!

372
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,914
Must you do this?

373
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:17,793
Okay, fine.

374
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:19,795
I get it.

375
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:36,228
By the way, did you come up here alone?

376
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:42,734
Right.

377
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:45,779
It makes no difference
whether I kill one person or two.

378
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:49,116
Right?

379
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,388
- Gosh.
- Let's go.

380
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:12,472
How are you getting home?

381
00:32:12,556 --> 00:32:13,974
- I'm taking a bus home.
- Mmm.

382
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:16,309
- Will you email me the music?
- Yes, I will.

383
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:17,394
Good work.

384
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:18,603
- Good work.
- Good job.

385
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:25,402
<i>I left the lyrics you asked</i>
<i>where your mother is resting.</i>

386
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:05,358
Let go of me!

387
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:13,491
We could've ended things
before it came to this.

388
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:14,826
Why?

389
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,369
Why? Why?

390
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,872
Why? Why?

391
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:36,514
Seokcheol!

392
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:44,814
That's enough.

393
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:24,020
<i>The person you've called</i>
<i>cannot be reached. You'll be directed...</i>

394
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:29,651
<i>The person you've called</i>
<i>cannot be reached. You'll be directed...</i>

395
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:38,827
Commander Building

396
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:06,813
<i>Miyoung,</i>

397
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,608
<i>I'd like to write to you the things</i>

398
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:12,527
<i>I couldn't tell you personally.</i>

399
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:16,740
<i>But I hope</i>
<i>you won't have to read this letter.</i>

400
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:21,995
<i>I hope I can retrieve this letter tonight</i>
<i>if possible.</i>

401
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:25,040
<i>Nevertheless,</i>
<i>if you happen to read this letter,</i>

402
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,125
<i>I might be</i>

403
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:30,003
<i>far away from you.</i>

404
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:31,880
<i>And it scares me.</i>

405
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:35,216
<i>I've forced myself</i>
<i>to prepare to part ways with you</i>

406
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:37,427
<i>in the possible future.</i>

407
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:42,307
<i>There's a problem I must handle.</i>

408
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:46,728
<i>This is the conclusion I've come to</i>
<i>after much thought.</i>

409
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:50,357
<i>And I plan to carry it out.</i>

410
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:53,485
<i>I won't ask for your understanding.</i>

411
00:35:57,322 --> 00:35:59,991
<i>I won't ask you to not resent me.</i>

412
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:13,004
<i>I want so desperately to see you.</i>

413
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:16,841
<i>I'll miss you.</i>

414
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:20,762
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

415
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:24,599
<i>Thank you.</i>

416
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,938
<i>- I love you.</i>

417
00:36:59,259 --> 00:37:02,262
MINISTRY OF LAW

418
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:17,318
Move.

419
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:23,241
<i>This ends the explanation,</i>
<i>and I shall now read out the ruling.</i>

420
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:27,454
The following is the ruling
on defendant, Oh Sangyeol.

421
00:37:27,537 --> 00:37:33,752
Defendant Oh Sangyeol
is sentenced to 20 years in prison

422
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:39,048
based on Article 4, Clause 2
of the Criminal Law

423
00:37:39,132 --> 00:37:44,345
regarding the punishment
for murder, assault, et cetera.

424
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:53,480
The following is the ruling
on defendant Park Seokcheol.

425
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:56,483
Defendant Park Seokcheol

426
00:37:56,566 --> 00:38:01,321
is found to have violated the law
regarding assault, and so on,

427
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:06,409
but he has admitted to his criminal act,
is deeply reflecting on himself,

428
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:10,246
and has willingly cooperated
in arresting the other culprit

429
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:14,125
during the investigation.

430
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:16,920
Thus, defendant Park Seokcheol

431
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:20,840
is sentenced
to two years and six months in prison.

432
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:00,922
- Stand by.
- Stand by.

433
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:15,478
<i>Inmate 5425, you have a visitor.</i>

434
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:31,870
Jeez, I can't stand this sight.

435
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:35,456
No, it's actually good to see.

436
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:38,084
Annoyingly enough, you look good in blue.

437
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:40,712
What are you, a Smurf?

438
00:39:44,257 --> 00:39:46,009
I hope you're doing well.

439
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:49,512
Once I get discharged,

440
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:53,308
treat me to that eel place
from the other day again.

441
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:55,560
It was delicious.

442
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:57,812
I crave it.

443
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:02,442
You can treat me
with the prison money you save up.

444
00:40:05,445 --> 00:40:07,155
Taehoon.

445
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,239
What?

446
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:11,826
Do me a favor.

447
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:14,996
What is it?

448
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:18,333
Promise you'll do it for me.

449
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:22,420
Don't tell me it's about Miyoung.

450
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:25,089
She has nothing to do with me anymore.

451
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:28,217
If it's something else,

452
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:31,679
I will.

453
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,728
Can you bear it?

454
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:42,398
Yes.

455
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:46,569
I'll visit you often.

456
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:50,156
Oh, right.

457
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:53,910
Someone paid off all our debt.

458
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:56,788
I asked the bank out of curiosity.

459
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:59,624
They said
the person wanted it to be a secret.

460
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:02,877
I asked Changsoo,
and he said it wasn't him.

461
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:06,255
Do you know who did it?

462
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,135
No.

463
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:43,501
Inmate 5425, you have a visitor.

464
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,945
Seokcheol. Seokcheol!

465
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:55,281
Seokcheol.

466
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:57,241
Where are you going?

467
00:42:57,784 --> 00:42:59,452
Why are you walking away?

468
00:43:01,454 --> 00:43:02,663
Seokcheol!

469
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:08,044
Seokcheol!

470
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:13,549
Seokcheol!

471
00:43:13,633 --> 00:43:15,051
Seokcheol!

472
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:41,828
TWO YEARS LATER

473
00:43:41,911 --> 00:43:44,580
Seokkyung, Hyeonggeun, Seokcheol

474
00:43:44,664 --> 00:43:46,415
<i>Mom, can you see me?</i>

475
00:43:46,499 --> 00:43:47,875
Yes, I do see you.

476
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:50,044
<i>Kihong, hurry over here.</i>

477
00:43:52,088 --> 00:43:55,675
<i>- Mother! Have you been well?</i>
- Yes.

478
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:58,094
Are you kids doing well too?

479
00:43:58,177 --> 00:44:00,179
<i>Of course, we're doing great.</i>

480
00:44:00,263 --> 00:44:01,472
You see,

481
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:04,642
Seokhee graduated
and got a job at a hospital.

482
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:07,603
Gosh,
why do you get to tell her?

483
00:44:07,687 --> 00:44:09,605
I was going to surprise her with the news.

484
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:15,069
I'm proud of you, my daughter.

485
00:44:15,153 --> 00:44:16,154
Kihong.

486
00:44:16,237 --> 00:44:19,323
My dear son-in-law, thank you.

487
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:21,075
Thank you.

488
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:23,911
Seokhee went through a lot.

489
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:42,555
<i>Don't put it in the fridge</i>
<i>right away.</i>

490
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:44,807
<i>Keep it out for about a day</i>
<i>before you eat it.</i>

491
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:51,147
Please accept it.

492
00:44:51,981 --> 00:44:53,566
If you don't, I'll get scolded.

493
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:57,111
Tell her I'm grateful.

494
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:02,408
Oh, I really like your song.

495
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:05,453
<i>The Story I Want to Hear.</i>
Seokkyung listens to it every day.

496
00:45:08,873 --> 00:45:09,874
Well, then.

497
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:11,834
Wait.

498
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:15,755
How's Seokcheol?

499
00:45:16,589 --> 00:45:17,590
Is he doing well?

500
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:20,509
Yes.

501
00:45:32,772 --> 00:45:35,066
Gosh, would it be too much?

502
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:37,026
Still...

503
00:45:38,611 --> 00:45:42,240
Hey, those people are making a fool
out of the customer with that car.

504
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:44,659
Yes, it's not a flooded car.

505
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:46,410
Hey, wait a bit.

506
00:45:47,662 --> 00:45:50,456
Regardless of what they do,
we shouldn't do that.

507
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:51,958
It's not how I do business.

508
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,460
What?

509
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:56,671
Then, go tell them

510
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:59,465
that my husband is a cop,
and they might be arrested for it.

511
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:01,175
Yes.

512
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:05,888
Jeongnim, remember our company,
Lilac Car Car Car's core values?

513
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:09,225
Diligence, integrity, and sincerity.

514
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,227
Keep those in mind.

515
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:13,646
- Now, handle it.
- Goodness.

516
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:15,022
Your wedding is a month away,

517
00:46:15,106 --> 00:46:17,275
and you're already using
your husband-to-be.

518
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:20,111
Who cares?
He's going to be my husband anyway.

519
00:46:20,945 --> 00:46:22,905
Whatever. Take this to Byeongsoo.

520
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:26,284
Why make kimchi for him
when we'll be married soon?

521
00:46:26,367 --> 00:46:28,035
He still needs kimchi until then.

522
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:29,704
He said he can't eat anyone else's kimchi.

523
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:32,581
You're so devoted to your sons-in-law.

524
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:35,418
Hyeonggeun, I'm off to work.

525
00:46:37,086 --> 00:46:39,130
- He doesn't even see me out.
- Just go.

526
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:41,549
- See you.
- Bye.

527
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:48,055
Mom, are you proud to see me working hard?

528
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:50,141
I am.

529
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:53,227
I'm so happy for you!

530
00:46:53,311 --> 00:46:54,562
- I'm off.
- Bye.

531
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:55,646
Drive carefully.

532
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:57,189
- This is heavy.
- Right.

533
00:46:59,442 --> 00:47:02,194
THE SUN ALSO RISES

534
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:17,126
How's Mom these days?

535
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:19,128
She's the same as always.

536
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:22,715
She nags at me all the time for having
had to look after her husband in prison

537
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:25,092
and now her son in prison.

538
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:27,595
What about Seokkyung?

539
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:30,306
Your sister is getting married next month.

540
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:31,849
You can attend her wedding.

541
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:33,642
That's good.

542
00:47:34,602 --> 00:47:36,062
Byeongsoo will be a good husband.

543
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:37,938
Right.

544
00:47:38,022 --> 00:47:40,691
Oh, Seokhee is visiting from the US.

545
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:45,321
How about you?

546
00:47:48,074 --> 00:47:50,326
I'm doing okay. I've found peace of mind.

547
00:47:51,744 --> 00:47:52,828
That's good to know.

548
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:56,999
Just so you know, I've brought that book
you asked for before.

549
00:47:57,083 --> 00:47:58,167
Okay.

550
00:47:58,918 --> 00:48:01,379
Oh, Father.

551
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:03,631
The day I get discharged,

552
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:05,800
don't come see me.

553
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:08,344
I'll leave on my own.

554
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:11,764
I'd like to see my family at home,
not here.

555
00:48:13,766 --> 00:48:14,767
I see.

556
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:16,560
I understand.

557
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,146
- Go on in.
- Okay.

558
00:48:24,068 --> 00:48:25,069
Seokcheol.

559
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:27,780
Stay healthy.

560
00:48:29,365 --> 00:48:31,492
Okay. You stay healthy, too.

561
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:10,406
Imagine you're singing just for me.
Give it a shot, okay?

562
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:33,971
Goodness, it's so nice.

563
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:36,390
Do you feel better now?

564
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:37,641
Yes.

565
00:49:37,725 --> 00:49:40,436
I feel like all my frustration
is going away.

566
00:49:41,437 --> 00:49:42,605
Goodness.

567
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:45,816
The truth is, I'm not special in any way.

568
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,776
I don't have a pretty face.

569
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:51,238
I don't have good dancing skills.

570
00:49:52,573 --> 00:49:56,160
I thought singing was something
I could at least call special about me.

571
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:58,329
Something I didn't want to let go of,
you know.

572
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:02,708
Actually, I wanted to give it all up.

573
00:50:03,751 --> 00:50:07,004
I wanted to sing in front of others,
but I couldn't.

574
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:11,217
But I couldn't just give up on my dreams.

575
00:50:11,884 --> 00:50:14,345
Because if I do,
there's nothing else left for me.

576
00:50:18,641 --> 00:50:20,601
You have a pretty face.

577
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:23,938
And you're good enough.

578
00:50:25,606 --> 00:50:27,775
You're good enough the way you are.

579
00:50:28,776 --> 00:50:29,777
Whatever you want to do.

580
00:50:36,242 --> 00:50:37,451
Oh, right.

581
00:50:37,535 --> 00:50:42,581
Do you remember when you got me a book
after hearing that I liked Hemingway?

582
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:44,833
<i>- The Sun Also Rises?</i>
- Yes.

583
00:50:46,335 --> 00:50:48,504
Even if it's cloudy,
the sun is still there.

584
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:52,258
Even if it's invisible,
hope is still there.

585
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:18,492
DO NOT SAY A THING

586
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:44,143
THE STRANGER

587
00:52:13,339 --> 00:52:14,381
- There.
- All right.

588
00:52:14,465 --> 00:52:17,343
<i>I wonder what influences you.</i>

589
00:52:17,426 --> 00:52:18,427
There we go.

590
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:21,263
<i>You write lyrics,</i>
<i>write songs, and even sing yourself.</i>

591
00:52:21,347 --> 00:52:23,390
<i>You're great at piano too.</i>

592
00:52:23,474 --> 00:52:24,975
<i>Thank you.</i>

593
00:52:25,893 --> 00:52:29,813
<i>Kim Jongjin's</i> Bravo My Life.
<i>It's time for a live-singing invitation.</i>

594
00:52:29,897 --> 00:52:32,775
<i>Today, we have with us Kang Miyoung,</i>

595
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:35,110
<i>the singer-songwriter</i>
<i>who is becoming popular</i>

596
00:52:35,194 --> 00:52:37,655
<i>through social media lately.</i>

597
00:52:37,738 --> 00:52:41,283
<i>A lot of people</i>
<i>enjoy listening to your music these days.</i>

598
00:52:41,367 --> 00:52:44,119
<i>Do you feel your popularity too?</i>

599
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:48,082
<i>I'm truly grateful</i>
<i>for all this support.</i>

600
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:51,168
<i>And I'm living each day</i>
<i>with a sense of gratitude.</i>

601
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:52,378
<i>But it still feels surreal.</i>

602
00:52:52,461 --> 00:52:55,297
<i>Even now,</i>
<i>it feels like a dream.</i>

603
00:52:55,381 --> 00:52:58,217
<i>Today, we invited</i>
<i>singer-songwriter Kang Miyoung for a talk,</i>

604
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,886
and to listen to her play the piano
and sing.

605
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:03,472
Time has flown by,

606
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:06,850
and sadly,
we've only got one last song left.

607
00:53:06,934 --> 00:53:09,269
Did you write it yourself too?
Tell me about it.

608
00:53:09,812 --> 00:53:16,068
The next song is for this person
who was like a tree to me.

609
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:18,112
Someone who is like a tree.

610
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:21,156
That's a poetic metaphor.

611
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:25,536
He wrote the lyrics for the first verse,
and I wrote the lyrics for the second.

612
00:53:26,662 --> 00:53:28,372
Like a tree,

613
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:31,917
he was always there,
giving me strength.

614
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,962
And this song is my belated reply to him.

615
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:39,133
<i>Your words tell me</i>
<i>the song holds a special meaning.</i>

616
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:40,968
<i>I'm even more excited to hear it now.</i>

617
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:44,096
