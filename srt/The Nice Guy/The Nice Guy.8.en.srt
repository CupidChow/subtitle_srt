00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:42,960
The Nice Guy

2
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:45,295
THIS DRAMA SERIES IS FICTIONAL,
AND THE PERSONS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,

3
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:46,588
SETTINGS AND EVENTS DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
SERIES HAVE BEEN FICTIONALLY CREATED

4
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:47,756
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN SAFE CONDITIONS

5
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:48,966
WITH THE CONSENT OF
AND IN THE PRESENCE OF GUARDIANS

6
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:59,059
How did the talk go?

7
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:04,189
The CEO seems to be very fond of you.

8
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:06,817
It might work out.

9
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:08,527
Good luck.

10
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:09,903
What is going on here?

11
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:12,573
I said I wanted to help you.

12
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,034
What do you want to hear from me?

13
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,579
You want me to thank you?

14
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:21,707
Is it fun
to play with someone else's life?

15
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:29,256
I refuse to cater to your mood,
so go.

16
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:30,549
Miyoung, wait.

17
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:31,633
- Let go.
- Wait.

18
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:33,176
- Let go of me.
- Hear me out!

19
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:36,972
Can't you stop pushing me away?

20
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:38,890
I also have a heart that breaks.

21
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:45,439
Let go of her.

22
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:50,485
What are you doing?

23
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:54,406
Don't get the wrong idea.
I talked to her about work only to help.

24
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,366
Help her with what?

25
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:00,620
Miyoung's dream is to be a singer.
I want to help her.

26
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:02,664
And why would you help her?

27
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:05,667
Because you can't.

28
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,464
- Seokcheol.
- And I can, so I will.

29
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:16,678
Don't bother about him, okay?

30
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:18,180
Let's go, please.

31
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:22,392
Call me if you need me
before I change my mind.

32
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:25,187
Taehoon.

33
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:28,649
If you keep this up,
it'll get very awkward between us.

34
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:34,655
"Awkward"?

35
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:42,162
Look. I thought we'd be different.

36
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:46,708
Seokcheol,

37
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:51,004
I'm not at all at ease around you either.

38
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,132
Seokcheol.

39
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,472
Let's go.

40
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:02,474
Go. Don't come back here again.

41
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,520
Good-bye.

42
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,319
It's okay.

43
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,330
<i>Taehoon.</i>

44
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:28,542
<i>If you keep this up,</i>
<i>it'll get very awkward between us.</i>

45
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:48,645
- What?
- You were scary back there.

46
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,690
I can be quite scary when I get mad.

47
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,817
Okay.

48
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:55,986
Oh, right. This is for you.

49
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:58,029
What is it?

50
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,824
I bought it because it was pretty.

51
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,118
It's a bit similar
to the one from the drawing.

52
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:07,747
What? You don't like it?

53
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:14,337
I'm touched.

54
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:16,548
That's a relief.

55
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:21,678
Seokcheol.

56
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:27,434
- Why don't we go somewhere?
- Go where?

57
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:29,478
Somewhere far away.

58
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,397
Oh. Far away? Where?

59
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:36,818
You know,
just anywhere far away that isn't here.

60
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:38,945
Why don't we just go now?

61
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,325
All right, let's go.

62
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:49,414
- Two tickets to Gangneung, please.
- Sure. It'll be the last bus.

63
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:54,252
- The bus will be here in five minutes.
- Okay, thank you.

64
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,549
One ticket to Gangneung, please.

65
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:14,272
Miyoung.

66
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:17,609
Miyoung?

67
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:20,654
Miyoung.

68
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:23,073
Miyoung!

69
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:26,952
Miyoung!

70
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:31,414
Seokcheol.

71
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,370
<i>I love you.</i>

72
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:35,955
<i>I've loved you for a long time now.</i>

73
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:38,583
<i>And I'll love you in the future too.</i>

74
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:41,294
<i>I love you too.</i>

75
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,255
<i>I've loved you for a long time now.</i>

76
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:48,093
<i>And I'll love you in the future too.</i>

77
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:55,725
The Nice Guy

78
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:05,402


79
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:09,364


80
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:15,662
Come on.
Kicks are only for losers.

81
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:18,456
Remember the thunderbolt skill
that I taught you?

82
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,625
That's the best fighting skill.

83
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:23,837
But it hurts to practice that skill.

84
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,132
If it hurts you,
it'll be worse for the other person.

85
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,509
It will be like
getting struck by a thunderbolt.

86
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:32,262
Watch closely.
I'll demonstrate it for you.

87
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:37,058
So, this kid in your class teases you
for your mom not coming to school, right?

88
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:39,853
Yes, he's the strongest one in school.

89
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,730
It's all right. Don't be scared.

90
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,859
When it comes to a fight,
you lose when you get scared.

91
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:50,030
If he tries to tease you again,
don't get whiny and go, "Stop teasing me."

92
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:52,282
Glare at him like this, okay?

93
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,492
Try it. Make a fierce glare.

94
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:57,829
Oh, goodness.

95
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:00,415
I said glare,
not roll your eyes into your head.

96
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:02,417
Glare with spite, like me.

97
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,461
Strain your eyes.

98
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,464
- Like this?
- Yes.

99
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:12,135
But if I glare at him,
he'll punch me for sure.

100
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,971
So don't give him the chance.

101
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:19,517
When you feel like he'll punch you,
grab him and do this.

102
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:21,269
Ow! Oh, my. My head's spinning.

103
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:23,438
Headbutt him like that.

104
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:24,522
Gosh, I'm dizzy.

105
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:28,026
This has been our family's secret skill
for generations.

106
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,945
It's our secret skill. Got it?

107
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:32,530
Now, give it a try.

108
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:34,199
Glare at it.

109
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:35,909
Grab it. Right.

110
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:39,079
Ahhh!

111
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:41,122
I won't do it.

112
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:44,876
How did a softie like you
come from this family?

113
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:48,129
No one in this family
has ever allowed anyone to hit them.

114
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:55,011
Well, I guess you won't cause any trouble
for your mom. That's what matters.

115
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:57,347
It's okay. Mom will come back soon.

116
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:02,143
Then, I'll go to school with Mom.
I don't have to practice the thunderbolt.

117
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:05,355
Right, don't.

118
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:08,233
I'll bring your mom over soon.

119
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:09,776
- Really?
- Yes.

120
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,362
- So get up. Let's go eat.
- Okay.

121
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:15,240
Dust off your buttocks.

122
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,867
Let's see who runs faster.

123
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:32,507
<i>I'll be there</i>
<i>to take your sister tomorrow.</i>

124
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,440
She couldn't have run off.

125
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:54,821
Where have you been?

126
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:58,241
I was out buying some tofu.

127
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,994
Don't do such things without telling me
You freaked me out.

128
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,412
I wanted to cook for you.

129
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,497
You're acting unusual
already in the morning.

130
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:05,999
Gosh.

131
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:09,210
Mom texted me yesterday.

132
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,672
She's coming to get me tomorrow.

133
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:14,966
She texted me too.

134
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,677
- So?
- So?

135
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:21,306
I'm going back.

136
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:26,352
But I still don't have the courage
to face Father.

137
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:30,273
Seokkyung,

138
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,775
Hyeonggeun has been praying
that you'll come home

139
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:35,236
when the lilac tree starts blooming.

140
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:41,117
How impressive of you
to make a 7-year-old kid rely on religion.

141
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,579
- My boy remembers the lilac tree?
- Yes.

142
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:51,252
When the lilac petals
would scatter in the yard,

143
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,756
he'd get excited,
saying, "This is like snow!"

144
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,675
I should go back.

145
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,469
Yes, I should.

146
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:00,762
I should go back.

147
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,521
It's not like you to be this obedient.

148
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,815
One should know when to be obedient.

149
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,400
I'm sick of it.

150
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:17,320
I'm sick of living off someone.

151
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:20,073
I'm sick of living in pitch darkness.

152
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:26,496
Pitch darkness? What do you mean?

153
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,960
"You can't picture your future
unless you unfold the cards."

154
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:33,044
It's what gamblers say.

155
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:38,132
Oh! Oh, goodness.

156
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,654
Are you still angry?

157
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:03,157
I texted you that I was still half angry.

158
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:06,577
When will all your anger go away then?

159
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:10,832
It's not going to go away
so easily.

160
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:15,962
Seokhee.

161
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,756
I'll behave.

162
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:22,176
That's no use.

163
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,262
Because half the anger
is directed at myself.

164
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:28,933
Why would you be angry at yourself?
Just take all your anger out on me.

165
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:31,978
I don't want to get angry with you
for my own problem.

166
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,354
It's mine to deal with.

167
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,315
What is your problem?

168
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,735
I don't see it.

169
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,570
What? You can't see?

170
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:41,738
My dream.

171
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:43,489
I don't see my dream.

172
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:47,285
I can't picture my future.

173
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:49,704
It's like pitch darkness.

174
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,956
Pitch darkness?

175
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,543
You wouldn't know its meaning.
It's a term my sister uses.

176
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:58,337
It kind of means that you feel hopeless.

177
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:04,093
I used to dream of becoming a nurse.

178
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:07,388
Then, my future was
to become a good nurse.

179
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:09,474
Now, I don't see it.

180
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,893
I don't see my future.

181
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:14,437
I can't picture it.

182
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,150
I guess you're burned out.

183
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:22,987
I hear nurses go through a lot
during their fifth year of training.

184
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,657
You have no right to comfort me.

185
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:28,993
You're partly responsible for it.

186
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,207
Seokhee.

187
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,462
Why don't we go somewhere in a while
to get fresh air then?

188
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,798
For a change, you know.
I know a good place nearby.

189
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:45,843
Where?

190
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:49,514
It's close by. We can get there quickly.

191
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:52,809
And I hear it's very hip.
I did some research about it.

192
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,394
Like this and that.

193
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,988
Thank you.
I'll escort you safely with kindness.

194
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:07,698
- I'm sorry. Thank you.
- Jeez.

195
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:14,705
The weather is so nice.

196
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,041
It's nice.

197
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:21,546
It feels different based on
which arm you use to link arms with me.

198
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,047
- Is it better for you too?
- Yes.

199
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:25,007
Really? Compared to...
Oh, you're right.

200
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,467
- Right.
- That's crazy.

201
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:29,428
Wait. Like this.

202
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:31,139
- Try it.
- Should I?

203
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:33,516
I can't clap behind my back.

204
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:34,600
- Why?
- I don't know.

205
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:37,103
Wait. You really can't. Oh.

206
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:41,399
Seokcheol, don't I remind you
of something?

207
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,026
What?

208
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:46,946
Oh, the drawing at your place.

209
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,448
- Yes, that poster.
- Right.

210
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:51,868
It's totally like that poster
to be here in this.

211
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,120
- You're right.
- With a piano, it'll be perfect.

212
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:57,415
- Who's going to move the piano?
- You will.

213
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,375
Because you're strong.

214
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:29,822
THE LATE KANG SEOYEON

215
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:31,073
Seoyeon.

216
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,368
Things have become a bit messy

217
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:38,164
between me and Seokcheol

218
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:40,416
with regard to work

219
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:42,418
and a woman.

220
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:46,380
Everything got complicated.

221
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,011
Seokcheol...

222
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:55,640
is planning to kill me.

223
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:05,816
I don't know what to do.

224
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:24,085
Taehoon, let them come
pay their condolences.

225
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:26,545
Talk it out with them.

226
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:29,507
- After the funeral.
- Call them.

227
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,633
Tell them not to come.

228
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:34,637
I don't want to lose myself
at my sister's funeral.

229
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,889
Hello, Mr. Chairman.

230
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:40,184
Damn, they're so freaking diligent.

231
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,311
Taehoon.

232
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,313
I get it.

233
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:46,566
Let go of me.

234
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:50,319
<i>My little sister is in there.</i>

235
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:52,238
I mean, Seoyeon.

236
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:55,700
She died because we couldn't get
30 million won for her surgery.

237
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:59,036
- Changsoo.
- That's enough.

238
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,539
- Changsoo!
- Punk.

239
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,040
Be respectful towards him.

240
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:05,918
Listen, I get it!
I know it's hard, but be polite--

241
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:08,254
- Why should I be polite to him, huh?
- Taehoon! Don't!

242
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:10,006
Snap out of it, punk.

243
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:15,344
Let's go, Sangyeol.

244
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:16,512
Take it back.

245
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:19,181
Take it back.

246
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:21,225
Take it all back.

247
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:24,854
Take it back, you damn thug!

248
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:29,567
Did you think
you could walk away that easily?

249
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,572
- What is it, punk?
- That's enough.

250
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:36,866
Are you out of your mind? Let go.

251
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:41,829
- Stop it.
- Show some respect, you rude bastard.

252
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:44,457
You're way younger than me.

253
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,500
Say that again, punk.

254
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:48,961
Please let him go.

255
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:55,676
I'm begging you, sir.

256
00:18:56,802 --> 00:19:00,348
I can't believe this.

257
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:03,476
Fine, let's do that.

258
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,525
How tearjerking.

259
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:19,408
Goodness.

260
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:23,579
- Taehoon, you think you can stand up?
- Yes.

261
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,387
Seokcheol.

262
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:43,474
I'll go alone.

263
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,269
We're not colleagues anymore.

264
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:51,607
Bye.

265
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,693
MYOUNGSAN INDUSTRIES

266
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:08,708
Seokcheol.

267
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:13,838
I should've looked after you as an elder,

268
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:16,340
but I owed you so much instead.

269
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:21,095
I won't forget.

270
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:24,807
Take care.

271
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:32,898
I'll come again.

272
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,953
The men are ready. They can be trusted.

273
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:47,913
Are they not from here?

274
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:49,832
No, but...

275
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:53,836
But what?

276
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,046
Do you want him dead?

277
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:02,553
Cheonho,

278
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:05,848
stick to your orders.

279
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:20,821
MYOUNGSAN INDUSTRIES

280
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:21,906
Say that again.

281
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:23,532
What did you say?

282
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:25,701
I apologize.

283
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:28,120
Dusik can't be reached.

284
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:40,382
Dusik can't be reached?

285
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,138
Smile, punk.

286
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:49,975
It'll bring you happiness, so smile.

287
00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:53,437
I apologize.

288
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:57,733
You can't smile, can you?
But smile because I want you to.

289
00:21:57,817 --> 00:22:00,861
I'm giving you a chance
Can't you?

290
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:09,787
- Pick what you like.
- Pardon?

291
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,582
A golf club or a bat. Pick one of these.

292
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:16,627
Well...

293
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:19,380
Mr. Chairman!

294
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:23,384
A bat seems like the better choice.

295
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:42,987
You're seriously
going to make me die early, aren't you?

296
00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:45,072
- Get back down.
- Yes, sir.

297
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,995
Sir, are you okay?

298
00:22:58,752 --> 00:22:59,753
How many did you take?

299
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:03,299
You didn't count? You're asking for more.

300
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:05,092
- Get back there.
- Yes, sir.

301
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,484
Good-bye, sir.

302
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:29,199
What are you looking at? Get back to work!

303
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:30,492
Yes, sir.

304
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,247
Where's Seokcheol?

305
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:38,042
He can't come to work today
due to some other business.

306
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,835
That punk really...

307
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,880
Are you okay, sir?

308
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:50,512
<i>So?</i>

309
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:53,682
So, it was way past 9:00 p.m.

310
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:56,477
You can imagine how dark it must've been.

311
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:59,605
And kids weren't allowed to have phones
at that time.

312
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:00,773
Right.

313
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:03,692
I think Seokhee was around 10 then.

314
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:05,778
Right, because I was in sixth grade.

315
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:08,113
What was she up to until that hour?

316
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:09,490
Who knows?

317
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:12,534
Our father, in his pajamas,
went out on a bicycle to find her.

318
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:14,620
I ran around the neighborhood too.

319
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:18,582
It was so dark, there were no streetlamps.
I sensed it was serious.

320
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:21,085
But then, from afar,

321
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:23,379
I saw a little girl
approaching with someone.

322
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,422
- Seokhee?
- Yes.

323
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:26,507
With Seokkyung.

324
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:28,217
Seokkyung found her?

325
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,428
That's hard to tell.

326
00:24:31,512 --> 00:24:33,013
It's not that she found Seokhee.

327
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:35,140
- Rather that Seokhee spotted her.
- What?

328
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:38,185
She was wandering
on a ridge between rice paddies

329
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:41,605
when she saw a cigarette light from afar.

330
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:43,983
She figured it was someone
and dashed toward her.

331
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:45,859
It turned out to be Seokkyung.

332
00:24:47,778 --> 00:24:48,821
Are you serious?

333
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:52,783
As soon as Seokhee met her,
she called out to her and cried in relief.

334
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:54,451
- Oh!
- Then, Seokkyung said,

335
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:57,579
"If you tell Dad that I smoked,
I'll leave you here."

336
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:02,376
- Your food is ready.
- Okay.

337
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:03,794
That's insane.

338
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,587
She's been like that
since childhood.

339
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:07,297
Is this about Seokhee or Seokkyung?

340
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:10,175
Both, I guess.

341
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:12,136
- It looks good.
- Thanks.

342
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:14,013
Thank you.

343
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:15,556
How appetizing.

344
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:17,391
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

345
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:20,394
SANGYEOL

346
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:22,730
It looks amazing. How pretty.

347
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:24,398
- Eat up.
- I'll cut it for you.

348
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:28,235
<i>The person you called is unavailable--</i>

349
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:31,447
That punk.

350
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:36,577
Now you're ignoring me too?

351
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:40,122
Goodness.

352
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:41,874
Wait.

353
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,000
This is...

354
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:46,503
Gosh.

355
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:48,213
Hey!

356
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:51,633
- Hey. Where is my suit?
- Which one?

357
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:54,887
My favorite white suit.
The one from my father.

358
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,096
I'm having it dry-cleaned.

359
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,639
What... Go get it now.

360
00:25:57,723 --> 00:25:59,183
Just wear something else.

361
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:01,060
Go get it now.

362
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:03,312
Yes, you want me to obey and follow.

363
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:07,441
Goodness.

364
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:29,129
Oh, my goodness!

365
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:32,382
Who is it?

366
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:37,930
Who is it?

367
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,849
- Open the door.
- Who...

368
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,601
What?

369
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:47,189
It's me, your friend, Go Jeongnim.

370
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:51,068
Ta-da!

371
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:54,154
I'm here for you.

372
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:55,489
Goodness.

373
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:56,990
Hey, this is insane.

374
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,409
What a nice house.

375
00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:01,662
- Don't touch anything.
- You startled me.

376
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:03,705
Jeez.

377
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,375
You really are impressive.

378
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,127
How did you find me here?

379
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:10,963
I heard you were staying at Seokhee's.

380
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,881
I asked around the neighborhood

381
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:15,551
If they knew
where the temperamental nurse lived.

382
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:20,180
Hey, don't hate her too much.
She may not seem like it, but she's kind.

383
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:21,682
As if.

384
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:24,142
Your sister kicked me out of the hospital.

385
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:29,565
I was pleading how sick I was,
but she made a fuss and forced me out.

386
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,108
Jeez, what is this? No way!

387
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:32,776
Hey.

388
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,945
You still have this?

389
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:37,072
How adorable!

390
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:39,324
- You're unbelievable.
- Give it to me.

391
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,785
And if you have nothing to say, just go.

392
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:43,453
You don't want Seokhee to see you here.

393
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:46,373
What?

394
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,336
I have nowhere to go.

395
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:54,715
I mean, the gambling house is down
because of you.

396
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:01,263
Speaking of which, Seokkyung...

397
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:02,347
Come here.

398
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:04,808
- What is it this time?
- Come.

399
00:28:04,892 --> 00:28:06,351
- Goodness.
- Come.

400
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:08,020
You nasty girl.

401
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:13,817
You know Changrak, right?

402
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:15,068
My ex-boyfriend.

403
00:28:15,152 --> 00:28:16,236
Changrak...

404
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:18,697
- The one with slanted eyes?
- Yes.

405
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,490
You're still in touch with him?

406
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:24,828
Well, after his time in prison,
he's changed. He's not the same.

407
00:28:24,912 --> 00:28:26,371
He quit drinking too.

408
00:28:26,997 --> 00:28:29,333
You still believe him
after all that he did to you?

409
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:33,128
It's not that he's believable.
I want to believe him.

410
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:34,504
Anyway, he...

411
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:39,593
He lends money in exchange for cars
near a casino. He's quite successful.

412
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,387
I hear he's totally settled down.

413
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:44,556
He owns an actual pawnshop.

414
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,350
- A car pawnbroker?
- Yes.

415
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:48,727
Hey, you know that's our specialty.

416
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:52,481
Changrak is so busy these days.
He's short-staffed.

417
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:55,442
So, what do you say

418
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,195
we go work there together?

419
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:00,948
Well...

420
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:03,283
- Gosh, girl.
- What?

421
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:06,244
I'm going back home tomorrow.

422
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:10,791
Home... What home?

423
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:15,128
You're broke.
You should be too ashamed to go home.

424
00:29:15,796 --> 00:29:16,880
What...

425
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:24,012
Come on, go to Gangwon-do with me.
Let's get down to this business.

426
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:27,057
You know car pawnbrokers can make
100 million won a year

427
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,266
once they settle down.

428
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:33,105
Work hard for just one year,
and go home with money.

429
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:36,149
I wouldn't suggest this idea
to anyone else but you.

430
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:44,116
You see, to be honest,

431
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:46,868
I feel sorry for you in many ways.

432
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:49,997
I'm the one who taught you how to gamble.

433
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:54,292
I'm the one who caused your family
to lose your house.

434
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:57,546
I'm telling you this to help you.

435
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,673
You crazy... At least you know.

436
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:08,098
We have to take a night bus
to Gangwon-do today.

437
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:09,850
Give it some thought, okay?

438
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:12,602
Or they'll have to find someone else.

439
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:15,063
It's better that we take the job.

440
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:28,827
Gosh, you should just wear
the one Seokhee bought you.

441
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:31,747
No one wears a suit like this these days.

442
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,416
Maybe only those circus hosts do.

443
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:37,044
You'll draw everyone's attention outside.

444
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:40,505
Don't worry. I wear this for attention.

445
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:44,426
You have some business to attend to today?

446
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:47,554
Yes, I'm going to meet Tick
and borrow some money.

447
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,267
Don't you worry.

448
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:55,062
He's not going to take
a private loan interest from me.

449
00:30:55,145 --> 00:30:56,521
How much are you going to borrow?

450
00:30:57,647 --> 00:31:00,734
70 million won at first
to pay off the bank loan.

451
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:03,487
And I'll find an apartment for us
later on.

452
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:09,284
You'll be at home tomorrow, right?

453
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:10,619
Tomorrow? Why?

454
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:13,538
I was just wondering if you'll be home.

455
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:15,665
You're being silly.

456
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:16,750
I'll be back.

457
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:18,376
Your zipper.

458
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:21,296
Oh, right. Thanks.

459
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:25,217
- See you.
- Bye.

460
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:38,313
Sir, I'm sorry I can't be of much help
regarding your bank issue.

461
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:39,648
No, don't mention it.

462
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:41,817
If not for you,

463
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:45,237
the branch manager wouldn't have
even talked to me in person.

464
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,322
Thanks.

465
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:48,824
No problem at all.

466
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:52,244
It's nothing
compared to all that you did for me.

467
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:57,374
Anyway, how's your business doing?

468
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:58,458
These days?

469
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:02,420
The loan shark business
is just as tough.

470
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:06,049
I'm a loan shark myself,
but I'd like to borrow money too.

471
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:10,178
Is that so?

472
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:14,141
Did you want to tell me something
in private?

473
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,561
No.

474
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:21,148
You're struggling just as much.

475
00:32:21,231 --> 00:32:22,440
Jeez.

476
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:24,401
Damn it, Tick.

477
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:26,736
You know what he wants to discuss
with you.

478
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:30,031
Look at you changing the subject
for someone so quick-witted.

479
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:34,244
His house is mortgaged to the bank.
It's about to be auctioned--

480
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:35,328
Stop.

481
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:42,669
- Tick.
- Yes, sir.

482
00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:46,756
Truth be told,
I'm currently in need of money.

483
00:32:47,424 --> 00:32:48,925
Could I ask you for help?

484
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:53,346
Sir, how much do you need?

485
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:58,727
- Can you lend me around 70 million won?
- 70 million?

486
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:05,317
Gosh,
you should've told me sooner.

487
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:09,988
You're not one to talk much about money,
so I had no idea.

488
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:12,157
I see.

489
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,076
Things happened to be this way
in my later years.

490
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:18,330
I'll wire the money to your account
at the date you want.

491
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:21,791
Gosh, thanks.

492
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:23,793
I'll take only around 10% interest.

493
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:27,297
What?

494
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:29,132
You ungrateful punk.

495
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,801
You'll take interest from him?

496
00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:33,261
Should I just...

497
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:40,477
Follow me out. Come.

498
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:44,147
You punk, if not for him,

499
00:33:44,231 --> 00:33:46,983
you'd still be homeless
at Cheonggyecheon Stream.

500
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:48,485
Follow me out.

501
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:50,278
- Now!
- Hey.

502
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:52,614
I'm not even asking
for prior interest or collateral.

503
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:55,075
I'm showing
more than enough respect for him.

504
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:57,160
What? Goodness!

505
00:33:57,994 --> 00:34:00,080
You really want to die, is that it?

506
00:34:00,664 --> 00:34:02,165
Is that what you want?

507
00:34:02,249 --> 00:34:04,251
Quiet down. The customers are watching.

508
00:34:04,334 --> 00:34:05,335
Sir.

509
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,172
- Tick.
- Yes, sir.

510
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:15,345
Thanks. I'll pay you back
with all the interest.

511
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:19,266
Damn him.

512
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:40,120
Sir, isn't he being
so disloyal and heartless?

513
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:42,038
How could that bastard do this to...

514
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:57,470
Ah.

515
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:12,444
Seokkyung.

516
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:17,115
Seokkyung.

517
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:18,950
Seokkyung?

518
00:35:24,331 --> 00:35:27,125
<i>Mom, I'm sorry.</i>

519
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:28,585
Seokkyung!

520
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:29,919
Seokkyung!

521
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:31,087
Seokkyung.

522
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:32,881
Seokkyung.

523
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,175
Seokkyung!

524
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:37,260
Seokkyung!

525
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:39,012
Seokkyung!

526
00:35:40,013 --> 00:35:43,058
Seokkyung. Seokkyung.

527
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,685
Seokkyung... Seokkyung...

528
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:48,355
- Seokkyung...
- Grandma.

529
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:50,065
Grandma!

530
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:54,486
Grandma, did you have a nightmare?

531
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:56,488
What?

532
00:35:57,447 --> 00:35:58,657
No, it's nothing.

533
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:02,077
Did Mom appear in your dream?

534
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,205
You kept calling her name.

535
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:06,956
Did I?

536
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:10,502
Yes. Do you miss her too?

537
00:36:11,378 --> 00:36:12,796
Of course.

538
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:15,548
I miss her so much.

539
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,843
I miss her too.

540
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:22,347
Gosh, do you?

541
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:26,267
I can't believe she's not coming back
to see you, my adorable puppy.

542
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:29,938
- Go back to drawing.
- Okay.

543
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:47,163
WE PURCHASE CARS AT A HIGH PRICE

544
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,257


545
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:04,180
<i>He lends money</i>
<i>in exchange for cars near a casino.</i>

546
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:05,473
<i>He's quite successful.</i>

547
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:07,767
<i>I hear he's totally settled down.</i>

548
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:09,519
<i>He owns...</i>

549
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:40,800
- Isn't it tiring?
- No.

550
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:47,182
How refreshing.

551
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:50,185
Gosh, you're exhausted.

552
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:53,605
Look here and smile.

553
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,693
It came out well.

554
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:02,614
Let's take selfies too.

555
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:07,368
Mmm.

556
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:10,538
- Want some noodles?
- Sure.

557
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:12,248
Hold on.

558
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:15,293
- Hi, Mom.
- <i>Where are you?</i>

559
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:18,213
- I'm out with Kihong.
<i>- Come meet me right now.</i>

560
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:21,341
- At your house? Now?
<i>- Yes.</i>

561
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:24,010
<i>I'll go bring your sister back home today.</i>

562
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:26,721
I feel too uneasy to wait until tomorrow.

563
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:30,391
<i>Mom, she's made up her mind.</i>
<i>She won't run away.</i>

564
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:34,312
No, she's one to run away for sure.
Come right over now.

565
00:38:35,188 --> 00:38:36,564
What...

566
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:38,900
What? What did she say?

567
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,527
Oh, man.

568
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:57,377
<i>Hey, you know that's our specialty.</i>

569
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:00,839
<i>Changrak is so busy these days.</i>
<i>He's short-staffed.</i>

570
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:09,722
<i>You know car pawnbrokers can make</i>
<i>100 million won a year</i>

571
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:11,808
once they settle down.

572
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:16,020
Work hard for just one year,
and go home with money.

573
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:19,691
I wouldn't suggest this idea
to anyone else but you.

574
00:39:32,412 --> 00:39:34,247
Gosh, it's relaxing.

575
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,749
The ocean
has such a beautiful color.

576
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:38,835
The weather is amazing, right?

577
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:40,920
Yes, I love the cool breeze.

578
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:46,092
Goodness. Just a moment.

579
00:39:48,678 --> 00:39:50,597
- Hi.
- <i>Where are you?</i>

580
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:53,224
Me?

581
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:55,685
I'm on a date.

582
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:59,439
<i>You picked the perfect day.</i>
<i>Mom wants to go to my house now.</i>

583
00:40:00,023 --> 00:40:02,400
- What? Now?
<i>- Yes.</i>

584
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:05,570
She wants to go drag Seokkyung home
in case she runs away.

585
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,280
This won't do. Come right away.

586
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:12,911
But I'm out far away.

587
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:14,829
<i>What do we do then?</i>

588
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:17,332
I need you there stuck next to Seokkyung.

589
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:20,919
If she's told to go home now,
she might really change her mind.

590
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:25,423
Jeez. Okay, let's hang up for now.

591
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:44,192
Hi.

592
00:40:50,365 --> 00:40:52,867
Hello? Seokkyung.
Where are you? At Seokhee's?

593
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:54,452
<i>Yes, I'm at Seokhee's.</i>

594
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:56,371
Congrats. I hear you're going back today.

595
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:59,248
<i>You made a great decision.</i>

596
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:00,416
- What?
<i>- You did.</i>

597
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:03,127
- My mom's coming tomorrow.
<i>- I just talked to Seokcheol.</i>

598
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:04,879
Your mother is coming today.

599
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:05,964
What?

600
00:41:06,047 --> 00:41:08,174
<i>I'm on my way too.</i>
<i>It'll take about 30 minutes.</i>

601
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:09,342
Why are you coming?

602
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:13,680
Seokcheol asked me to stay glued to you
as if I was arresting a criminal

603
00:41:13,763 --> 00:41:15,431
in case you changed your mind.

604
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:19,018
You don't have to come.

605
00:41:19,102 --> 00:41:23,147
<i>What are you talking about?</i>
<i>I have to go, for your safe return.</i>

606
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:27,360
You're too scared of your father to go.
You'll be fine if you go with me.

607
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:30,321
<i>I doubt he'll break your leg</i>
<i>in my presence.</i>

608
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:32,115
<i>- And if he still tries,</i>

609
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:34,993
<i>lock the doors and stay in your room.</i>
<i>I'll stop him somehow.</i>

610
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:36,411
I'll see you later. Bye.

611
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:47,005
<i>Seokkyung is going back home today.</i>

612
00:41:47,088 --> 00:41:48,089
- Really?
- Yes.

613
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,257
That's great.

614
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,467
Shouldn't you go home, then?

615
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:52,969
No.

616
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:55,346
Let me be free

617
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:58,182
from all my family businesses
at least for today.

618
00:41:58,266 --> 00:41:59,434
I'd love that.

619
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:44,812
Oh, goodness.

620
00:42:48,858 --> 00:42:50,485
Hello, ma'am.

621
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:53,321
Hi, Kihong.
Sorry we have to meet on a day like today.

622
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,948
No, I should be here
on a good day like today.

623
00:42:56,032 --> 00:42:57,658
- Please get in.
- Thanks.

624
00:42:57,742 --> 00:42:58,951
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi.

625
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:01,871
- Where's Dad?
- He stepped outside.

626
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:04,874
We'll bring Seokkyung back home
without him?

627
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:07,043
It's better than him
slamming the doors in her face.

628
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:10,546
If we get her in the house
while your dad's away,

629
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:12,298
he won't be able to drag her out.

630
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,092
All right. Let's go.

631
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:16,010
Okay, let's take off.

632
00:43:36,906 --> 00:43:37,990
All right.

633
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:46,541
Seokkyung, I'm here.

634
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:48,668
Do you have a lot to carry?
I'll come up if you do.

635
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:50,711
<i>It's not a lot.</i>

636
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:52,255
I'll wait down here, then.

637
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:54,674
<i>Wait a bit. I need to fix my makeup.</i>

638
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:56,134
Okay. Hurry down.

639
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:17,780
You look much younger
than before.

640
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:22,368
And you've become better with your words.
Now you know how to flatter.

641
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:23,703
Oh, please.

642
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:25,913
How could you let me see you this way?

643
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:29,500
You should visit your future father-in-law
from time to time.

644
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:32,670
What are you talking about
all of a sudden?

645
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:33,921
What, am I wrong?

646
00:44:34,005 --> 00:44:35,631
You're right, ma'am.

647
00:44:35,715 --> 00:44:36,716
I mean, Mother.

648
00:44:38,968 --> 00:44:40,928
Goodness. I have as many as two daughters,

649
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:43,055
but it's so hard
to become a mother-in-law.

650
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:47,101
I'll visit you more often
from now on, Mother.

651
00:44:49,979 --> 00:44:51,522
I'll drive you safely, Mother!

652
00:44:52,315 --> 00:44:54,567
Thanks.

653
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:10,666
She's taking too long to fix her makeup.

654
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:13,836
It can't be.

655
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,672
It can't be. Goodness, no way.

656
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:19,508
Why do I keep having this bad feeling?

657
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:22,637
Maybe I should quit being a detective.

658
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:25,890
Seok...

659
00:45:27,016 --> 00:45:28,017
Jeez!

660
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:36,484
Seokkyung!

661
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:40,029
Seokkyung!

662
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:41,197
Goodness gracious.

663
00:45:52,792 --> 00:45:54,252
BYEONGSOO

664
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:25,283
- One ticket to Jeongseon.
- Jeongseon, sure.

665
00:46:25,366 --> 00:46:27,994
- The earliest one, please.
- Okay.

666
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:48,306
Mom. It has a nice view.

667
00:46:49,015 --> 00:46:51,017
- But too many stairs.
- Watch the stairs.

668
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:52,977
What the...

669
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:58,024
<i>I'm sorry, Byeongsoo.</i>
<i>Don't look for me.</i>

670
00:46:58,107 --> 00:47:00,109
<i>- Thanks for everything.</i>
- What the...

671
00:47:00,693 --> 00:47:03,321
- Byeongsoo.
- Oh... Oh! Ma... Ma'am!

672
00:47:03,404 --> 00:47:05,823
A text?

673
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:07,325
You're here too.

674
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:11,620
<i>Mom, take care of Hyeonggeun</i>
<i>for me for one more year.</i>

675
00:47:11,704 --> 00:47:14,665
<i>I'm too ashamed to face you now.</i>
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

676
00:47:14,749 --> 00:47:16,208
This crazy wench!

677
00:47:16,292 --> 00:47:19,962
<i>Seokhee,</i>
<i>I'm wearing your socks. Sorry.</i>

678
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:22,673
<i>Spend time freely with Kihong</i>
<i>at your place now.</i>

679
00:47:22,757 --> 00:47:24,550
She's out of her mind.

680
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:26,260
- Goodness.
- Mother!

681
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:28,095
- Mom.
- What's wrong?

682
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:29,805
I don't know, punk.

683
00:47:30,431 --> 00:47:32,141
Hurry in first.

684
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:33,225
Byeongsoo.

685
00:47:44,904 --> 00:47:48,032
<i>Seokcheol, I...</i>

686
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:18,687
- Gosh, I'm so full.
- Me too.

687
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:22,566
Would you like
some aromatic scorched-rice water?

688
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:25,486
Oh, we're actually too full.

689
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:26,987
- But thank you.
- Thank you.

690
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:30,991
- I can't eat anymore.
- Same here.

691
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:35,079
SEOKKYUNG

692
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:40,584
You won't pick up?

693
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:45,631
I should.

694
00:48:52,138 --> 00:48:54,181
- Seokkyung?
- <i>Hey.</i>

695
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:56,600
<i>Seokcheol.</i>

696
00:48:57,518 --> 00:48:58,894
I'm listening.

697
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,647
I'm not going home.

698
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:04,442
I can't bring myself to.

699
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:09,905
I'm sorry.

700
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:14,994
<i>I thought I should tell you.</i>

701
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:18,372
It's too much for me.

702
00:49:20,249 --> 00:49:21,250
You know, right?

703
00:49:23,586 --> 00:49:25,504
Yes, I know.

704
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:27,923
I'm sorry.

705
00:49:30,009 --> 00:49:31,510
At least you are.

706
00:49:34,472 --> 00:49:37,433
<i>If you want to leave and go far away,</i>
<i>go ahead and do that.</i>

707
00:49:39,477 --> 00:49:42,605
<i>Instead, let me know from time to time</i>

708
00:49:43,439 --> 00:49:44,690
<i>that you're doing well.</i>

709
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:48,235
<i>But...</i>

710
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:51,030
<i>if you suddenly feel like coming back,</i>

711
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,033
don't ignore it,

712
00:49:55,868 --> 00:49:57,119
because it means that

713
00:49:58,329 --> 00:50:00,873
one of us is missing you.

714
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,421
That's family, you know.

715
00:50:13,886 --> 00:50:15,596
I feel bad for Hyeonggeun.

716
00:50:17,348 --> 00:50:19,099
The world has lots of good moms...

717
00:50:19,934 --> 00:50:22,728
...but out of them all,
I happened to be his mom.

718
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:35,741
I need to go.

719
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:40,454
Okay, go on.

720
00:50:41,956 --> 00:50:44,500
Call me if something happens, okay?

721
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:49,296
Bye.

722
00:50:49,922 --> 00:50:50,923
Bye.

723
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:17,700
<i>Family can be a burden</i>
<i>or a strength sometimes.</i>

724
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:21,620
<i>Tearfully, my sister said</i>
<i>she couldn't return home.</i>

725
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:23,998
<i>Perhaps</i>

726
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:26,959
<i>family couldn't be her strength.</i>

727
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:28,794
<i>Or perhaps</i>

728
00:51:29,545 --> 00:51:32,214
<i>she didn't want to be a burden herself.</i>

729
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:34,925
We're leaving in one minute.

730
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:44,685
MOM

731
00:51:48,689 --> 00:51:50,691
HORRIBLE WENCH

732
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:14,548
POWER OFF

733
00:52:18,469 --> 00:52:19,845
We're leaving.

734
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:42,451
- Just drop us off here.
- Okay.

735
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:44,411
- My dad might be asleep.
- Got it.

736
00:52:57,049 --> 00:52:59,843
I'll sleep over here tonight.
You can go home.

737
00:52:59,927 --> 00:53:00,928
Okay.

738
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:02,429
Thank you.

739
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:06,141
Go in and get some good rest for now.

740
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:07,893
Bye.

741
00:53:12,648 --> 00:53:14,733
Don't show it to your father.

742
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:17,236
Tell him we had dinner together.

743
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:18,404
Of course.

744
00:53:35,129 --> 00:53:36,213
Dad!

745
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:39,007
Wait. Hey, you...

746
00:53:39,091 --> 00:53:41,885
Hey, hey, hey.

747
00:53:41,969 --> 00:53:43,178
Have you been well?

748
00:53:43,262 --> 00:53:46,640
Stop this. You're a grown-up woman.

749
00:53:46,724 --> 00:53:49,685
- We came back after dinner together.
- I see.

750
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:50,811
I'm sleeping over here.

751
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:52,771
Why? You have a home of your own.

752
00:53:52,855 --> 00:53:55,566
To chat with you and stuff.

753
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:57,651
- Is Hyeonggeun asleep?
- He fell asleep just now.

754
00:53:57,735 --> 00:53:59,194
- Don't wake him up.
- Auntie is here.

755
00:54:04,992 --> 00:54:06,452
Why are you in a daze?

756
00:54:07,411 --> 00:54:08,829
Is Seokcheol coming late today?

757
00:54:09,455 --> 00:54:11,915
He's on a trip. He texted me.

758
00:54:11,999 --> 00:54:13,876
What trip all of a sudden?

759
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:25,387
Horrible wench.

760
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:57,336
We're leaving in five minutes.
Go take care of your needs if you have to.

761
00:54:58,170 --> 00:55:01,256
- I'm going to the bathroom, sir.
- Okay, go on.

762
00:56:01,275 --> 00:56:04,111
MYOUNGSAN - JEONGSEON

763
00:56:12,661 --> 00:56:13,829
<i>Seokkyung,</i>

764
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:17,332
<i>Hyeonggeun has been praying</i>
<i>that you'll come home</i>

765
00:56:17,416 --> 00:56:19,585
<i>when the lilac tree starts blooming.</i>

766
00:56:55,954 --> 00:56:59,791
It's said that
every star is the light of the past.

767
00:57:00,459 --> 00:57:02,628
Some are the lights from years ago.

768
00:57:02,711 --> 00:57:06,465
And some are the lights
from hundreds of years ago,

769
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:07,924
traveling all the way here.

770
00:57:09,051 --> 00:57:12,054
Thus, the past and present are connected.

771
00:57:14,806 --> 00:57:16,141
I believed

772
00:57:16,725 --> 00:57:18,560
we'd meet again someday.

773
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:22,564
I thought it'd be nice
to run into you on the street

774
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:27,736
or pass you by in a moving car.

775
00:57:29,655 --> 00:57:33,325
And when I actually met you again,

776
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:34,910
I was so happy

777
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:38,038
that my wish came true.

778
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:44,795
It wasn't just your wish.

779
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:47,255
My prayer was answered too.

780
00:57:52,219 --> 00:57:55,013
Let's never part ways again,
no matter what happens.

781
00:57:56,765 --> 00:57:58,141
Let's never part ways again.

782
00:58:58,201 --> 00:58:59,911
Hyeonggeun!

783
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:03,749
Hyeonggeun!

784
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:06,835
Ms. Jo Maksoon!

785
00:59:10,338 --> 00:59:11,339
Mom?

786
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:13,884
Mr. Park Silgon!

787
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:17,053
Your foolish daughter

788
00:59:17,888 --> 00:59:19,806
is back home!

789
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:22,684
Mom!

790
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:30,609
Father!

791
00:59:31,276 --> 00:59:32,486
Mom!

792
00:59:33,445 --> 00:59:35,197
Hyeonggeun!

793
00:59:44,498 --> 00:59:46,583
Hyeonggeun!

794
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:56,009


795
01:00:21,326 --> 01:00:22,494
The Nice Guy

796
01:00:23,078 --> 01:00:24,746

<i>Go in and beg him for forgiveness.</i>

797
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:25,831
Dad. Seokkyung.

798
01:00:25,914 --> 01:00:27,457
<i>Let him cuss you out</i>
<i>and beat you up.</i>

799
01:00:27,541 --> 01:00:29,000
Father! No, Father!

800
01:00:29,084 --> 01:00:30,627
<i>Who took the order?</i>

801
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:32,671
<i>Seokcheol? Are you sure about this?</i>

802
01:00:33,255 --> 01:00:35,215
<i>Your father</i>
<i>wants to sell this house.</i>

803
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:38,718
<i>I borrowed some money</i>
<i>on this house as security.</i>

804
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:41,721
<i>You must be going through a lot.</i>

805
01:00:41,805 --> 01:00:42,848
Is it ready?

806
01:00:43,598 --> 01:00:44,766
<i>We can attack right now.</i>

807
01:00:44,850 --> 01:00:45,851
Begin.

808
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:57,696
<i>My son, Seokcheol,</i>
<i>said he'd quit.</i>

809
01:00:58,572 --> 01:01:00,323
<i>Let him go on a good note.</i>
