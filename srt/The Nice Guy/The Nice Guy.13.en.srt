The Nice Guy

00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:44,920
THIS DRAMA SERIES IS FICTIONAL,
AND THE PERSONS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,

3
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:46,338
SETTINGS AND EVENTS DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
SERIES HAVE BEEN FICTIONALLY CREATED

4
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:47,548
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN SAFE CONDITIONS

5
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:48,966
WITH THE CONSENT OF
AND IN THE PRESENCE OF GUARDIANS

6
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,551


7
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:52,678
PREVIOUSLY

8
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:53,971
Close your eyes.

9
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,722
I have a crush on you.

10
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:58,100
You said you liked reading books.

11
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:01,144
<i>"The Sun Also Rises."</i>

12
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:04,147
<i>My sun has risen again.</i>

13
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,191
<i>That girl from our childhood?</i>

14
00:01:06,275 --> 00:01:08,527
You guys liked each other
so much back then.

15
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,698
<i>Are you going to get serious?</i>

16
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,033
You may not know,

17
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:17,995
but he wouldn't be like this
had he not gotten expelled.

18
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:21,331
<i>About what happened to you</i>
<i>after I left this neighborhood.</i>

19
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:23,333
<i>Why didn't you tell me anything?</i>

20
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,129
I don't regret it.

21
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,591
<i>I perform here starting today.</i>

22
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:32,884
Do you like music?

23
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:35,721
Oh, yes.

24
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:38,974
Have just one glass.

25
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:42,436
- I need to go and meet my boyfriend.

26
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,979
Park Seokcheol.

27
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:45,689
Why does it have to be you?

28
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:49,151
Are you the one
behind Seokcheol's accident?

29
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,737
Yes. I am behind it.

30
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,239
Break up with Seokcheol.

31
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:57,576
<i>Then at least</i>
<i>he won't get hurt because of me.</i>

32
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:00,620
I want us to break up.

33
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:04,708
<i>I'll keep the promise I made.</i>

34
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:14,676
<i>You see,</i>
<i>I was truly happy because of you.</i>

35
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,638
But if I stayed with you,

36
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:21,433
you'd always get hurt
and sacrifice yourself.

37
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:24,436
So, I broke up with you.

38
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:28,982
- I'm sorry.

39
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,234
I'll be there in an hour.

40
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:33,737
- Be careful on the way.
<i>- Okay, I'll see you soon.</i>

41
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:37,991
Must you do this?

42
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:39,660
We're sorry.

43
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:41,119
Sangyeol wants to bring you over.

44
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:43,872
Hey, Park Seokcheol.

45
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:45,999
You damn traitor.

46
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:49,127
You won't be able to leave here
in one piece.

47
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:51,254
If this is because I'm a traitor,

48
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:53,382
I won't just take it.

49
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:55,717
Are you challenging me now?

50
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:00,013


51
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:04,267
You dare act noble until the end?

52
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:05,477
Fine, continue.

53
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:07,062
Keep going, you punk!

54
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:08,689
Do it!

55
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:14,986
It's actually very brilliant.
I need your help with this.

56
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:19,491
<i>Let's have eels</i>
<i>at that place from the other day.</i>

57
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:20,909
Taehoon.

58
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:22,536
You didn't know, did you?

59
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,037
Today's the day you die.

60
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,835
Sir. You must hurry on out.

61
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:33,046
Park Seokcheol. Where is that punk?

62
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,923
Give her a ride
to the express bus terminal.

63
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:37,008


64
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:55,110
It's all right.

65
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:59,531


66
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:12,919


67
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:18,925
Do you perhaps remember
the guy who stabbed you?

68
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:22,471
Go check on Seokcheol
if you have time to accuse me.

69
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:24,806
I don't know who stabbed him,

70
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:28,935
<i>but if it were me,</i>
<i>I wouldn't keep him alive.</i>

71
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,210
Sir.

72
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:56,755
I'm sorry.

73
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:16,858
<i>We've heard a lot</i>
<i>about you, sir!</i>

74
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:19,319
Jang Wooseok of Myoungsan High School,
42nd batch.

75
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:21,780
It's my book report on Kim Ku.

76
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,241
You said you'd take me in if I wrote it.

77
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,367
Wooseok.

78
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,327
Thank you for remembering my name.

79
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,870
I want to be like you.

80
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:30,121
No matter what you say,

81
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,583
I'll devote my life to this.

82
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,804
- Hello?
- <i>Sir, are you okay?</i>

83
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:47,764
Yes, I'm okay.

84
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:52,435
- Let me ask you something.
<i>- Sure, anything.</i>

85
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:55,564
You have Wooseok's number, right?
Jang Wooseok.

86
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:57,482
<i>You mean, that high schooler</i>
<i>from the other day?</i>

87
00:05:58,108 --> 00:05:59,109
Yes.

88
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,361
Text me his number now.

89
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:12,956
SON HEUNGMAN, MYOUNGSAN

90
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,708
SIR, HERE'S JANG WOOSEOK'S NUMBER

91
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:29,514
The Nice Guy

92
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,560
SAMJUN E&C

93
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:52,579


94
00:06:57,876 --> 00:06:59,169
Come in.

95
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,004
Have a seat.

96
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,881
Coffee?

97
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:05,550
Tea?

98
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:15,810
How is

99
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,063
Seokcheol?

100
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:22,317
I just met the detective.

101
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:27,489
I told him I was pretty sure
about who did that to Seokcheol.

102
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,992
Why are you taking this so far?

103
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:32,994
What do you mean?

104
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,163
Stabbing Seokcheol?

105
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:37,749
It wasn't me.

106
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:41,169
He's the one who tried to kill me.

107
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:47,050
It's hard to believe,
but that's the truth.

108
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:50,887
Why?

109
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:52,681
Don't you believe me?

110
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,434
You may think
Seokcheol is different from me,

111
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,771
but we were cut from the same cloth.

112
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:00,855
We're no different.

113
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:05,068
And now, there's no going back.

114
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,238
I'm not going to sit back and watch.

115
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,657
By any means possible,

116
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:12,951
I'm going to protect him.

117
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:15,537
It would better if you stayed out of it.

118
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,497
That's for me to decide.

119
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:19,666
Stop now.

120
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,835
I came to tell you this.

121
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:24,003
Miyoung, it's just...

122
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:29,300
Reality doesn't go the way you want it to.

123
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:34,472
This rain that falls over the two of you
may feel like pleasant spring rain.

124
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:36,641
But it's still going to drench you.

125
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,395
I'd want to be with him
even if I get drenched.

126
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,523
He means that much to me.

127
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:48,278
Do you like Seokcheol? No...

128
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,157
The way he put it,

129
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:53,700
are you in love

130
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:55,744
with him?

131
00:08:58,413 --> 00:08:59,414
Yes.

132
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:07,672
Okay.

133
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:11,760
From the moment you leave this room,

134
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,055
make sure I don't see you ever again.

135
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:48,880
CHAIRMAN KIM CHANGSOO

136
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:57,138
Hello, sir.

137
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:11,694
Hello, sir.

138
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:18,076
I was away for a week,
and you already took over my seat?

139
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,577
No way, sir.

140
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:21,329
No way, sir.

141
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,084
This seat seems comfy, doesn't it?

142
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:28,711
It's the hot seat.

143
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,843
So, are you feeling all right?

144
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:36,344
It's none of your business.

145
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:40,140
- Did anything happen while I was away?
- No. Oh.

146
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:44,477
Actually, something did happen.

147
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:46,688
Something happened? Like what?

148
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:49,858
Seokcheol

149
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,110
got stabbed.

150
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,323
What?

151
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:06,124
Did you do it?

152
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:10,503
Goodness, no. Please, sir.

153
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:13,047
It was Kang Taehoon and his gang.

154
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:20,889
You've always been like this.

155
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:23,975
You act like you didn't do what you did.

156
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:29,147
I regret it so much.

157
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:33,067
Believing your lies
and letting go of Taehoon.

158
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:39,365
I'll excuse myself, sir.

159
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:42,869
Oh Sangyeol.

160
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:48,458
Yes, sir.

161
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:53,838
Let me ask you again.

162
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,174
Was what happened to Seokcheol

163
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,134
your doing?

164
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,761
No, sir.

165
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,056
If it was...

166
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:08,478
I will make you pay.

167
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:19,948
I promised Silgon
that I'd never let him get hurt.

168
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:22,742
I see.

169
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:56,943
Did you ask for me?

170
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:58,611
Close the door.

171
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,326
- Younggi.
- Sir.

172
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,453
I need you to finish him.

173
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:09,831
Hurry to this address.

174
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:12,000
Excuse me?

175
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,752
I'll explain later, so just go, you punk.

176
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,893
HAIR SALON

177
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,688
Seokkyung.

178
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:35,732
Hi, Seokkyung.

179
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:37,942
Hey, what are you doing here?

180
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:39,027
Seokkyung!

181
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,236
Don't come near me.

182
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,904
- Seokkyung!
- Ahhh!

183
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,990
What happened to your hair?

184
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:47,035
Oh, this.

185
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:49,328
It's because I got my heart broken.

186
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,332
This is all because of
that jerk, Changrak.

187
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:54,834
Changrak?

188
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:59,297
Yes, I went to Jeongseon
because that jerk said he needed me.

189
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,467
But it turned out
he already shacked up with his secretary.

190
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,551
That horrible jerk.

191
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:07,388
He told me to just make coffee.

192
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:09,682
Goodness.

193
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,186
Seokkyung, I've missed you.

194
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,146
Damn it, you disgust me. Get off me.

195
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,230
Goodness.

196
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:18,399
- Seokkyung.
- Goodness.

197
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:26,074
Hey, doesn't this bring back old memories

198
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:28,034
of when we used to
run a hair salon together?

199
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:31,079
To be exact, I used to run it, not us.

200
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:33,414
What you did was teach me how to gamble.

201
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:38,127
I loved those days.

202
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:39,253
Yeah, right.

203
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,882
Had I not opened a hair salon, I'd not
have learned how to gamble from you.

204
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:45,802
I wouldn't have fallen in love
with the sashimi chef.

205
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:49,013
But you got to have
your adorable Hyeonggeun.

206
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:51,724
That was a good thing.

207
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:55,186
Doesn't he miss his dad?

208
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,855
No. Why would he miss that jerk?

209
00:14:57,939 --> 00:15:00,316
He may still want to see his dad.

210
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,111
Not him.

211
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,738
My son's got someone
who's really sweet to him.

212
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:08,282
Who?

213
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:09,742
Are you seeing someone?

214
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,037
Good for you.

215
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:15,289
What does he do for a living?

216
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:17,250
He's a cop.

217
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,752
- He's a violent-crimes detective.
- Are you serious?

218
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:23,381
He's just someone I've known
since I was little.

219
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:24,465
He's Seokcheol's friend.

220
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,092
Man.

221
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:29,011
You sure are one damn lucky girl.

222
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:33,099
You gambled your family's house away,
but your gangster brother got you out,

223
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:37,270
while your detective boyfriend
is head over heels for you.

224
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:40,148
Right.

225
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,608
Like you say, I've got everything,

226
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,068
except for money.

227
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:46,487
Gosh, you don't have that.

228
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,660
- Jeongnim.
- What?

229
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:54,287
How about we sell used cars?

230
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,746
Car pawnbroking?

231
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,999
You turned me down when I brought it up.

232
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,333
Not pawnbroking.

233
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:00,877
A real used-car business.

234
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:04,213
Instead of ripping off people,

235
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:06,966
let's do something legal and decent.

236
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:11,846
You think we could pull that off?

237
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,014
Why couldn't we?

238
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:14,515
Jeongnim.

239
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:19,061
I have to make lots of money
so I won't be ashamed to face my family.

240
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:43,794
Seokcheol.

241
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:46,881
- Yes?
- What's on your mind?

242
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:47,965
Oh.

243
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:50,301
Nothing, I was just spacing out.

244
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,554
Doesn't it feel stuffy to be stuck here?

245
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:56,390
A little.

246
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,312
I'm happy we get to be here
and smile at each other like this.

247
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:03,564
That's a relief.

248
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:07,109
- Just a moment.
- Where are you going?

249
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:08,527
To the bathroom.

250
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:10,112
Do you want me to go with you?

251
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:12,031
Jeez. No, thank you.

252
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:13,699
Why? I'll go with you.

253
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:16,827
- I can go to the toilet alone.
- Tell me if something comes up.

254
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:18,079
Okay.

255
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,011
<i>This is Park Seokcheol.</i>

256
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:20,600
I'm not calling to blame you.

257
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,645
So, don't hang up, talk to me.

258
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:28,816
<i>Answer me, Jang Wooseok.</i>

259
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:31,819
Okay.

260
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,073
Give me honest answers

261
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:38,826
to what I'm about to ask.

262
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:41,078
Who told you to do it?

263
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:44,874
<i>Answer me.</i>

264
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,752
This isn't your problem alone.

265
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:52,381
I'm sorry.

266
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,855
I bet she makes only a little
all day.

267
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:08,981
Does she?

268
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:11,192
And she has to clear out
her business soon.

269
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:13,861
Yes.

270
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:15,780
What does your father do?

271
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:19,408
- He's dead.
- Oh, I see.

272
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:22,453
You'd better take good care
of your mother.

273
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:25,539
What's your dream?

274
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,709
To make a lot of money

275
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,671
and open a big shop for my mom.

276
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:34,256
What a devoted son.

277
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,134
Then, you should work hard
to make a lot of money.

278
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:39,470
The truth is,

279
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,722
Mr. Seokcheol is against the idea,

280
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:44,767
but I want to make it big as a gangster.

281
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:49,438
Right. If you've decided
to join this world, you must make it big.

282
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:51,565
Instead,

283
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:56,570
don't struggle to get ahead
like other ordinary boys.

284
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:57,988
Start as an elite.

285
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:03,452
- An elite?
- Yes, you punk.

286
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,622
I'll help you start as an executive.

287
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:09,083
Then, it'll be a piece of cake

288
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,711
to open a big snack bar
for your mother, you punk.

289
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,131
Are you interested?

290
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:19,093
What must I do in exchange?

291
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:23,305
Have you

292
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,850
killed someone?

293
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,104
No, I haven't.

294
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:32,231
Figures. It's not easy.

295
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:36,277
But it may not be too hard,
depending on how you take it.

296
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:38,821
We'll clean up after you.

297
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:40,531
So,

298
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:42,783
are you interested?

299
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:52,960
Who should I kill?

300
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:04,680
Park Seokcheol.

301
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:08,976
What?

302
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,060
Can't you do it?

303
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:18,736
That's a little...

304
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:20,237
I see.

305
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:25,367
You don't know
why that guy is standing there, do you?

306
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:30,080
I'm giving you an opportunity

307
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:33,167
while threatening you at the same time.

308
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:37,546
I've told you a secret,

309
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,256
and you've heard it.

310
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,050
So, if you turn me down...

311
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:47,097
you'll have to see your mom
at the funeral.

312
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:54,647
You punk.

313
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:58,150
Just let your hand do the work,
and it'll be over in no time.

314
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,152
Understand?

315
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,726
Oh.

316
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:33,894
Taxi.

317
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:46,824
I am...

318
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:50,411
so sorry, sir.

319
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:57,626
Wooseok.

320
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,753
Jang Wooseok!

321
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:03,048
I'm okay.

322
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:04,592
So, stop crying,

323
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:07,052
and go to the police right now.

324
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:09,138
<i>- Go turn yourself in.</i>

325
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,723
<i>Don't stay there.</i>

326
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:12,433
<i>Move right now, got it?</i>

327
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:14,435
Only then will you survive,

328
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:15,853
and I'll forgive you.

329
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:17,354
Gangsters don't let anyone

330
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,108
with blood on their hands walk away.

331
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:23,319
<i>Do you understand me?</i>

332
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:25,696
Hurry out of there,
hide yourself, and call me.

333
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,802
Hey, open the door.

334
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:58,187
What the... Were you crying?

335
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:01,398
What a wuss.

336
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:03,108
You're a humiliation to men.

337
00:24:03,734 --> 00:24:04,735
Let's go.

338
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:06,820
Go where?

339
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:08,405
It's dangerous here.

340
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:10,991
Seokcheol knows that you stabbed him.
He's out looking for you.

341
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:14,119
What are you waiting for? Come out.

342
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:22,920
Jeez.

343
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,303
INN

344
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:37,059
Get in.

345
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,855
Get in, you punk.

346
00:24:53,784 --> 00:24:56,120
MYOUNGSAN HOSPITAL

347
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:03,669
<i>As the downturn of the construction...</i>

348
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,838
You'll be fine without painkillers
starting tomorrow.

349
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,423
You're recovering pretty fast.

350
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,883
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

351
00:25:13,804 --> 00:25:14,972
Will you be okay alone tomorrow?

352
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:16,682
Of course.

353
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:19,184
Remember those people
who performed with me before?

354
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:21,020
We're meeting up tomorrow.

355
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:24,982
A place in Hongdae is hiring a band.
We're going to audition together.

356
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:28,360
I wish I could go with you.

357
00:25:29,153 --> 00:25:31,155
- And be my manager?
- Yes.

358
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:33,365
How can you with this injury?

359
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:35,826
Let me be your manager instead.

360
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:38,328
Thanks.

361
00:25:38,996 --> 00:25:43,125

00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:52,593
<i>the body of a teenage boy, Jang, was found</i>

365
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:54,970
<i>and the police have started</i>
<i>to investigate it.</i>

366
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:58,432
<i>The police believe</i>
<i>Jang was driving a motorcycle</i>

367
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:00,684
<i>when he crashed into</i>
<i>the construction materials</i>

368
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:04,104
<i>while passing the ramp of Sudol Bridge,</i>
<i>which was under repair,</i>

369
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:06,190
<i>and fell into the river.</i>

370
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:09,359
<i>They're now investigating</i>
<i>the details of the accident.</i>

371
00:26:09,443 --> 00:26:12,446
<i>According to a police official,</i>

372
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:16,742
<i>they are looking into</i>
<i>whether the crash was just an accident,</i>

373
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:19,203
<i>while also questioning why the motorcycle</i>

374
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:21,663
<i>- was on a dark, remote road...</i>
- Damn...

375
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:23,957
<i>...that has been left unrepaired</i>
<i>for a year.</i>

376
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:28,253
<i>Sir.</i>

377
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:29,922
<i>Wooseok was...</i>

378
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:33,300
<i>taken care of by Sangyeol.</i>

379
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,143
Wait. Please wait.

380
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:48,023
Don't kill...

381
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:53,987
- Please.
- Boys.

382
00:26:54,071 --> 00:26:55,948
You've just beat him up.
Don't hit him again.

383
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,199
Please don't kill me.

384
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,159
Please!

385
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:02,579
Forgive me.

386
00:27:02,663 --> 00:27:04,832
Please.

387
00:27:04,915 --> 00:27:05,916
Bro.

388
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:07,835
You punk.

389
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:09,336
Good job.

390
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,423
Please don't kill me.

391
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,681
No.

392
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,727
Please don't kill me!

393
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,021
Please!

394
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:36,405
I'll be going.

395
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:05,726
SEOKCHEOL

396
00:28:12,566 --> 00:28:13,817
SEOKCHEOL

397
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:29,666
How are you feeling?

398
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:31,877
Are you okay?

399
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:34,796
Taehoon.

400
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:37,507
Let's meet up.

401
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,426
Meet you?

402
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:43,722
Are you telling me to visit you?

403
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:46,850
I can't trust you.

404
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,062
Once you come, you'll be able to.

405
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:52,397
So, meet me.

406
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:04,034
How dare he order me around?

407
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,093
You're dismissed now.

408
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:30,519
You seem fine for someone who got stabbed.

409
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:34,231
You seem fine as well.

410
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:39,361
Seokcheol,

411
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:42,489
what you have to say

412
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:45,409
better sound persuasive,

413
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:48,704
or things will get very complicated
between us.

414
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,220
It wasn't me who called you out that day.

415
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:09,224
That text was sent by Oh Sangyeol.

416
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:12,978
Oh.

417
00:30:14,688 --> 00:30:15,689
Look, Seokcheol,

418
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,859
if you explain yourself late like this,

419
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:21,653
do you expect me to understand
and believe your words?

420
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:27,159
You know what happens
when someone leaves a gang.

421
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:30,871
I was tied up,
and Oh Sangyeol took my phone.

422
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:33,248
It wasn't you

423
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,126
who sent someone to stab me.

424
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:42,090
I know

425
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:44,843
who it was.

426
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:48,930
Oh Sangyeol.

427
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:59,483
Damn it. This...

428
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:08,492
Oh Sangyeol.

429
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:12,537
Hey, focus on recovering first.

430
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,707
I'll handle Sangyeol, that punk.

431
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:17,918
Stay out of it.

432
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:21,004
I'll take care of him my way.

433
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:22,589
Your way?

434
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:24,132
How?

435
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:26,635
You can't go talk him out of it alone.

436
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,720
You idiot, do you still not get it?

437
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:31,181
That doesn't work
for that scumbag Sangyeol!

438
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:41,900
He hurt someone else too.

439
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:46,279
He killed a boy.

440
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:47,906
A high school boy.

441
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:50,075
Taehoon,

442
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:53,203
our lives may be messed up,

443
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,705
but some things must not be done.

444
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:02,546
I've got this. I'll handle it my way.

445
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:13,098
All right.

446
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:14,975
But...

447
00:32:16,977 --> 00:32:19,729
don't let me hold your funeral myself.

448
00:32:31,992 --> 00:32:33,160
Miyoung came to me and said

449
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,454
she wouldn't just sit back and watch.

450
00:32:37,414 --> 00:32:38,665
She said she'd protect you.

451
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:40,208
She told me so.

452
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:44,713
Think carefully.

453
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:48,091
You'd be sacrificing too much,
trading your life

454
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:49,968
for someone like Oh Sangyeol.

455
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:54,222
I'll stay out of it.

456
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:16,953
Dr. Jang.

457
00:33:17,037 --> 00:33:20,040
What is it?
Why do you keep walking around?

458
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,335
Hey, let me get discharged.

459
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:27,589
No way, you punk.
You need a few more days here.

460
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:29,966
And I'm not your doctor.
Talk to the doctor in charge.

461
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:33,637
I came to ask you
because I knew my doctor wouldn't listen.

462
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:37,891
Convince him to discharge me.
This is what friends are for.

463
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:40,227
I have something urgent at home.
I need to leave.

464
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:42,771
Like what? Tell me.

465
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:45,148
I'm visiting your family today.
I'll handle it for you.

466
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:47,192
Why are you visiting my family?

467
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,154
You don't need to know why.

468
00:33:51,238 --> 00:33:53,156
Well, I guess it's good.

469
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:55,867
Then, let's all meet later at home.

470
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:58,286
Discharge me. I'm counting on you.

471
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,288
- I'm off, Dr. Jang.
- Hey.

472
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:02,958
I'll see myself out.
You're busy. I'll let you work.

473
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:06,044
No need to see me out.

474
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:07,963
Unbelievable.

475
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:11,591
He thinks he can discharge himself.

476
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,555
Oh, goodness.

477
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:25,146
Dr. Park, hello.

478
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,315
I'm calling about patient Park Seokcheol.

479
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,526
Yes, right. My friend.

480
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:31,695
How's his condition?

481
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:34,614
Is he okay to be discharged,
and continue outpatient treatment?

482
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:44,291
- Wait. You're taking it off?
- Yes.

483
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,794
Miyoung, we have good news.
They're discharging me.

484
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:49,713
Really?

485
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:52,799
Yes, his doctor said he was good to leave.

486
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:55,093
You just need to come in for a check-up.

487
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:57,345
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

488
00:34:57,429 --> 00:35:00,265
- This is great.
- I know.

489
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:03,810
Miyoung, come with me to my house today.

490
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:05,186
Your house?

491
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:09,232
Yes, come meet Hyeonggeun,
my older sister, and my parents.

492
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,527
Oh, today?

493
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:14,779
I can't.

494
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:18,033
Why not?
Then, are you going to let me go alone?

495
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:20,285
But it's too sudden...

496
00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:24,331
I'll just drop you home today.

497
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:29,044
Okay, then. Just drop me home.

498
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,296
That was too sudden.
I got really surprised.

499
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:33,465
SEOKHEE

500
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:34,758
<i>Hi, Kihong.</i>

501
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:36,718
Seokhee, where are you?

502
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,261
<i>I'm on my way home.</i>

503
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:40,555
I'm off to your house now.

504
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:43,516
- Where? Here?
<i>- No, your family's.</i>

505
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:47,520
Why would you go there?

506
00:35:47,604 --> 00:35:49,814
Why?
Can't I visit your family?

507
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:52,233
I have something to tell your mother.

508
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:54,361
You've got something to tell my mom?

509
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:56,321
I do.

510
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,823
Come to think of it,
I've got something to say.

511
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:00,617
So, what is it?

512
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,161
Come hear it yourself and you'll find out.

513
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:06,873
If you're curious,
take a taxi and hurry over there.

514
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:08,375
Hello? Hello...

515
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:12,212
What on earth?

516
00:36:22,222 --> 00:36:23,348
It's okay.

517
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:36,778
Seokcheol,
I can't visit them today. You go in alone.

518
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:40,198
You came all the way here.
Follow me in and say hello.

519
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:41,991
Come eat with us. You're hungry.

520
00:36:42,075 --> 00:36:45,078
I guess I can say hello,
but later, when I'm in better shape.

521
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:46,705
Right now, it's...

522
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:48,623
Why? Jeez, you look beautiful.

523
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:50,125
You're always pretty.

524
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,543
Still, let me do it later.

525
00:36:52,419 --> 00:36:53,420
Wait.

526
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,880
- My stomach.
- What? Why?

527
00:36:55,964 --> 00:36:58,216
- Gosh, the stitches. Wait.
- Does it hurt?

528
00:36:58,299 --> 00:36:59,551
- Yes.
- Where? How?

529
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:01,010
- Does it hurt?
- Wait. Yes.

530
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:02,470
- Are you lying?
- I'm not.

531
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:04,305
- No. Oh, my goodness.
- I'm not ready.

532
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:05,849
Maybe it's getting infected.

533
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:08,143
- You're lying, aren't you?
- It hurts.

534
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,352
Oh, please.

535
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:14,107
Wow! How pretty!

536
00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:17,569
- Thanks.
- You punk.

537
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:21,781
- Prettier than your mom?
- Uh...

538
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:25,952
- You're prettier.
- What?

539
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:39,716
All right.

540
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:44,471
Go ahead and have some.

541
00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:46,055
- Eat up.
- Please enjoy.

542
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:47,932
- Thank you.
- Do you want this?

543
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:49,768
Sure.

544
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:51,978
- Eat up.
- Okay.

545
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:57,358
You're pretty even when you chew.

546
00:37:57,442 --> 00:38:00,195
Don't stare at her when she's eating.

547
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:03,281
Why? I'm just saying she's pretty
because she is.

548
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:05,283
Oh, have some of this too.

549
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:09,454
Mom, the fruit is good,
but we haven't eaten yet.

550
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:10,580
Darn you.

551
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:12,791
You didn't even call us.
Don't even ask about food.

552
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:15,293
Your sister is going to cook.

553
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:17,378
Me?

554
00:38:17,921 --> 00:38:20,006
Gosh, how tiring.

555
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:22,634
It's already tiring cooking for my son,

556
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:25,720
now I have to cook
for my brother and his girlfriend.

557
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:26,930
Let me help out.

558
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,097
No.

559
00:38:28,181 --> 00:38:30,266
It's a joke.

560
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:35,980
Anyway, I guess my brother
has great taste in women.

561
00:38:41,778 --> 00:38:43,154
Tell us about your family.

562
00:38:43,947 --> 00:38:45,698
There's no need to ask her
about her family.

563
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:50,036
Come on. You brought her over.
Can't I even ask questions?

564
00:38:50,912 --> 00:38:52,163
It's just me.

565
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:54,332
My mother recently passed away.

566
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,715
Gosh, it must've been hard.

567
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:04,259
I'm happy to have you here.

568
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:05,885
We welcome you with all our heart.

569
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:07,762
Eat some more.

570
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:11,140
Mother, Father. Hello.

571
00:39:11,224 --> 00:39:12,475
Wait. What brings you by?

572
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:14,644
- What brings you at this hour?
- Miyoung.

573
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:16,104
- Can I get some food?
- What?

574
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,188
Hi, Miyoung.

575
00:39:17,272 --> 00:39:18,523
Hello.

576
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:19,607
Byeongsoo is here!

577
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:20,692
Oh, my goodness.

578
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:23,278
- And what brings you by?
- Why are you here?

579
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,864
I called him so we could all have
an awkward dinner.

580
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:26,990
Come on in.

581
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:29,826
- Good, welcome. Come on in.
- Come in.

582
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:32,495
Have a seat.
Have some fruit first.

583
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:34,038
Hurry in.

584
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:40,670
Mmm...

585
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:52,015
Kihong, why aren't you eating much?

586
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:53,933
Have some radish kimchi.

587
00:39:54,017 --> 00:39:55,894
It's your favorite kimchi.

588
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:57,645
Thank you.

589
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:03,151
One moment, please.

590
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:06,905
I have something to tell you.

591
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:09,657
First off, Mother,

592
00:40:11,034 --> 00:40:14,704
I really enjoy the kimchi
you send me every once in a while.

593
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:17,081
Good. Tell me if you need more.

594
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:18,416
Seokcheol will deliver it.

595
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:20,209
Mom, please. Enough with the kimchi.

596
00:40:20,293 --> 00:40:21,502
And the deliveries.

597
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:24,505
Seokcheol, you won't
have to do it anymore.

598
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:26,007
I'll come take it myself.

599
00:40:28,718 --> 00:40:30,011
Mother,

600
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:33,514
I'd like to have your kimchi
for the rest of my life.

601
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:35,266
What?

602
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:38,269
Oh, my goodness.

603
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:39,938
- What?
- Jeez.

604
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:43,816
Please allow Seokhee to study abroad.

605
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:45,985
I'll go with her.

606
00:40:46,069 --> 00:40:48,112
And just so you know,

607
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:50,406
you won't need to worry about money.

608
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:54,744
I have enough saved up for our studies
and living expenses together.

609
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:02,543
And Father, we...

610
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:04,128
No.

611
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,801
I would

612
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:11,761
like to marry Seokhee.

613
00:41:18,393 --> 00:41:19,477
If you'll allow it,

614
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,895
I want to have

615
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:23,356
a happy married life with her!

616
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:32,573
Oh, well... That's... Well...

617
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:33,783
What the...

618
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:37,120
You didn't say this to me.
Is this what you were going to say?

619
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:38,287
Yes.

620
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:40,123
Why? You don't want to marry me?

621
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:41,749
I want to.

622
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:44,502
But what is this? You didn't even propose.

623
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:45,586
Ah.

624
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:49,507
Don't tell me
you'll do it here.

625
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:51,968
Don't you dare, or I'll kill you.

626
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:56,848
Wait. No. Keep going.

627
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:58,433
It'd be weird to stop here.

628
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,519
Let's see
how much cornier it will get from here.

629
00:42:03,563 --> 00:42:04,772
You crazy...

630
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:06,733
Don't take out your hand.
I said I'd kill you.

631
00:42:07,734 --> 00:42:09,861
Right, propose to her later.

632
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:11,863
It'd be tragic to die
in the middle of a meal.

633
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:17,452
Right, let's eat first.

634
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:18,786
Save it for later, now eat.

635
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:21,581
Right, eat up. Let's eat.

636
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:24,333
Father, Seokkyung, and I would also...

637
00:42:24,417 --> 00:42:25,543
Eat.

638
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:26,753
Yes, Father.

639
00:42:26,836 --> 00:42:29,338
- What are you doing?
- You have no sense of seniority.

640
00:42:29,422 --> 00:42:31,424
- Eat.
- Okay.

641
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,410
Please spare me, sir.

642
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:02,830
I didn't mean to keep you in the dark
that day. Believe me.

643
00:43:02,914 --> 00:43:05,583
Just answer my questions.

644
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:07,460
If you answer correctly...

645
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:12,381
I may spare you.

646
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:16,469
But if you tell me lies
or make up stories...

647
00:43:18,763 --> 00:43:22,016
I may use this money
to pay my condolences for you.

648
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:26,145
Now, let me ask you.

649
00:43:26,229 --> 00:43:28,189
The text from Park Seokcheol...

650
00:43:30,066 --> 00:43:31,150
Who was behind it?

651
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:35,363
It wasn't from Park Seokcheol.

652
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,949
Oh Sangyeol sent it himself. His phone--

653
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:40,868
I meant to let you know
that day.

654
00:43:40,952 --> 00:43:42,161
But I missed the timing.

655
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:45,748
Correct.

656
00:43:46,541 --> 00:43:48,543
Thank you. Thank you!

657
00:43:49,544 --> 00:43:50,628
Should we kill and bury him?

658
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:53,965
Throw him to Sangyeol...

659
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:56,342
alive.

660
00:44:00,221 --> 00:44:01,848
Mr. Chairman. Sir!

661
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:49,770
Seokcheol...

662
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:52,773
That punk...

663
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:53,858
He already...

664
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:59,405
I did my job.

665
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:11,167
Give him a round of applause!

666
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:14,712
- Nice.
- Goodness.

667
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:16,464
There you go.

668
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:18,883
- Goodness.
- You're better than your uncle.

669
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:19,967
- Good, right?
- Yes.

670
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:21,344
Well done.

671
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:33,356
Who taught him that?

672
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:35,942
- Gosh.
- Nice. You're so good.

673
00:45:36,025 --> 00:45:38,527
Amazing.

674
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:40,488
Good!

675
00:45:47,662 --> 00:45:48,955
Who do you take after?

676
00:45:49,038 --> 00:45:51,082
- Who?
- Your mom, right?

677
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:16,899
Father.

678
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:18,567
What is it?

679
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,028
Do you remember

680
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:26,200
when you told off the man
who used to sell chicks

681
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:28,744
by the school when I was little?

682
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:33,457
Did I?

683
00:46:35,251 --> 00:46:36,252
You did.

684
00:46:38,004 --> 00:46:42,008
At that time, you seemed like
the coolest man in the world.

685
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:50,308
- Chicks...
- Right.

686
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:52,310
Chicks.

687
00:46:58,190 --> 00:46:59,191
Father.

688
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:00,818
What?

689
00:47:06,574 --> 00:47:08,242
Will you have faith in me

690
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:11,829
no matter what I choose to do?

691
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:18,794
Sure.

692
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:20,880
I'll trust you.

693
00:47:45,071 --> 00:47:46,739
Hyeonggeun is good.

694
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:48,824
I know. His moves are sharp.

695
00:47:55,164 --> 00:47:57,166
SEOKCHEOL

696
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:39,834
Damn it!

697
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:03,732
YEOLJEONG
NIGHTCLUB

698
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:07,319
MYOUNGSAN POLICE STATION

699
00:49:07,403 --> 00:49:09,822
As many as two conflicts
broke out in a single week.

700
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:12,867
It seems a war has begun
between Myoungsan and Samjun.

701
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:14,452
Kim Changsoo pulled out,

702
00:49:14,535 --> 00:49:16,495
and Oh Sangyeol's acting like
he's taken over.

703
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:18,664
It has led to another power struggle.

704
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:22,460
I have a bad feeling about this.

705
00:49:22,543 --> 00:49:24,879
Should we call in both sides
for investigation?

706
00:49:26,589 --> 00:49:29,008
It's meaningless
to pounce on the small fry.

707
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:30,551
We must go after the heads.

708
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:32,219
Oh Sangyeol.

709
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:33,929
And Kang Taehoon.

710
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:48,235
The key's inside.
It's as good as new now.

711
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:51,155
Thanks.

712
00:49:52,323 --> 00:49:54,950
And about the accident
from the other day...

713
00:49:55,034 --> 00:49:56,744
I know you got into an accident.

714
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:58,704
It's all right.

715
00:49:58,787 --> 00:50:00,998
It was close to a wreck
before I repaired it.

716
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:02,291
Don't bother.

717
00:50:02,875 --> 00:50:04,585
How can I not?

718
00:50:05,753 --> 00:50:07,463
- It's a bit more than the market price.
- No.

719
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:10,090
Take it.

720
00:50:11,634 --> 00:50:12,635
Thank you.

721
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:14,345
Oh, right.

722
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:16,388
Someone I know
is a loan shark in Miwol-dong.

723
00:50:16,472 --> 00:50:17,806
And?

724
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:20,601
One of his new subordinates is Dusik.

725
00:50:21,894 --> 00:50:24,104
- Dusik?
- I think he's changed his name.

726
00:50:24,188 --> 00:50:27,024
But it's obvious how he looks.
A big head and a rectangular face.

727
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,527
It's Dusik.

728
00:50:31,612 --> 00:50:33,656
- Got it. Have a good day. I'm off.
- Okay.

729
00:50:34,615 --> 00:50:35,908
- Drive safely.
- Okay.

730
00:51:04,812 --> 00:51:05,813
Mr. Chairman.

731
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:10,067
Long time no see.

732
00:51:16,699 --> 00:51:17,700
Are you feeling okay?

733
00:51:19,118 --> 00:51:20,327
Yes, I'm all right.

734
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:24,290
I'm sorry about the other day.

735
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:25,749
Don't be.

736
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:29,378
You should've left the gang
a long time ago.

737
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:33,507
Sir,

738
00:51:35,134 --> 00:51:38,470
did you perhaps
let Sangyeol take over the company?

739
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:41,599
I'd never do that.

740
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:44,935
Maybe if it were you or Taehoon.

741
00:51:45,978 --> 00:51:47,313
I'm just leaving him be.

742
00:51:48,314 --> 00:51:50,524
It'll eventually go down on its own.

743
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:54,320
I obsessively held onto what was falling.

744
00:51:55,613 --> 00:51:56,614
I regret it,

745
00:51:58,449 --> 00:52:00,117
and it was all for nothing.

746
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:07,166
I will take care of Oh Sangyeol.

747
00:52:09,043 --> 00:52:10,461
I thought I should let you know.

748
00:52:14,757 --> 00:52:15,758
How?

749
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:17,635
I'll do it my way.

750
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:29,563
Go ahead.

751
00:52:30,356 --> 00:52:31,357
But...

752
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:34,818
don't get hurt.

753
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:40,491
Or I will be too ashamed
to face your father.

754
00:52:47,081 --> 00:52:48,707
Please take care of your health.

755
00:52:50,459 --> 00:52:51,460
Be careful.

756
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:53,003
I will, sir.

757
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:16,110
Yes, sir.

758
00:53:46,682 --> 00:53:48,767
Damn it, everything got deleted.

759
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:05,367
Hello.

760
00:54:08,996 --> 00:54:11,248
Sir, I've checked.

761
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:14,334
It seems they deleted the past footage
from our car's dash cam.

762
00:54:16,295 --> 00:54:18,005
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

763
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:21,091
The footage starts
from the day Wooseok died.

764
00:54:22,009 --> 00:54:23,218
Damn it.

765
00:54:27,181 --> 00:54:29,433
Sir, I've given it some thought.

766
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:33,061
Our van wasn't the only vehicle
on the bridge that day.

767
00:54:35,022 --> 00:54:36,356
- Then?
- The thing is...

768
00:54:49,161 --> 00:54:50,162
<i>Don't kill me.</i>

769
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:51,872
<i>I wonder if it still exists.</i>

770
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:54,708
I've tried to check, but it's not easy.

771
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:57,419
You know Sangyeol doesn't leave his car
to anyone else.

772
00:54:57,503 --> 00:54:59,796
So, I've tried to unlock his car,

773
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,381
but you know I have no such skills.

774
00:55:05,093 --> 00:55:07,429
Anyway, are you sure about doing this?

775
00:55:07,513 --> 00:55:11,266
If things go south, it will be worse
than getting hurt for you.

776
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:15,395
I know...

777
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:18,857
but I need to see the end of it.

778
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:37,543
Damn it!

779
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:39,127
Damn.

780
00:55:53,392 --> 00:55:54,601
Look at you.

781
00:55:56,436 --> 00:55:57,437
I'm sorry.

782
00:56:02,651 --> 00:56:04,069
Sir, I'm truly sorry.

783
00:56:04,152 --> 00:56:07,906
If you drag me back to the gang,
Sangyeol will beat me to death.

784
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:10,284
Quiet down.

785
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:11,994
I resigned.

786
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:13,787
Pardon?

787
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:16,373
Stand up. I'm not here to take you back.

788
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:18,250
Sit down.

789
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:20,752
Gosh.

790
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:23,547
Then, what business do you have with me?

791
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:26,341
You punk.

792
00:56:26,425 --> 00:56:29,595
If you meant to run off,
you should've at least given me a call.

793
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:32,347
I'm sorry, sir.

794
00:56:32,431 --> 00:56:36,602
I wanted to call you,
but I felt too ashamed.

795
00:56:36,685 --> 00:56:38,186
I'm sorry.

796
00:56:39,605 --> 00:56:41,982
What would you have said
if you'd actually called me?

797
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:47,112
That I was grateful
for you looking after me,

798
00:56:47,195 --> 00:56:49,489
and that I'd turn over a new leaf.

799
00:56:50,574 --> 00:56:51,575
I'm sorry.

800
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:54,036
Goodness.

801
00:56:54,745 --> 00:56:57,164
And you call this turning over a new leaf?

802
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:00,000
I like that you just don't change.

803
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:01,877
I'm sorry.

804
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:03,503
Never mind that.

805
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:05,756
I came to ask you a favor.

806
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:07,758
Ask me a favor?

807
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:10,427
What exactly is it?

808
00:57:12,054 --> 00:57:13,055
I need your help.

809
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:15,599
You need my help?

810
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,685
But there's nothing I can do, sir.

811
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:20,687
There is something you can do.

812
00:57:20,771 --> 00:57:22,105
There's something you're good at.

813
00:57:24,191 --> 00:57:25,442
Prying doors open.

814
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:29,655
Oh, that. I'm quite good at it.

815
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:33,950
Can you open cars too?

816
00:57:34,034 --> 00:57:35,744
Cars?

817
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:36,828
Cars...

818
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:41,667
I guess you could think of house doors
and car doors as the same.

819
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:43,085
But doors...

820
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:44,628
So, can you do it or not?

821
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:46,880
I can. Yes, I can.

822
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:49,257
I can pry open anything you ask.
I can do it.

823
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:53,929
But whose car should I pry open?

824
00:57:59,518 --> 00:58:01,645
Just what's with you bastards?

825
00:58:03,063 --> 00:58:04,189
What's so scary about them?

826
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,441
You can't?

827
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:08,193
Why can't you?

828
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:10,737
What do you even do
except feed yourselves?

829
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:19,204
So, are you gathering the boys?

830
00:58:19,287 --> 00:58:21,206
Yes, we're getting them ready.

831
00:58:21,289 --> 00:58:23,834
You're taking forever
to get ready, you damn...

832
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:30,298
We need to raid Yeoljeong-dong immediately
and drag Kang Taehoon's gang out of there!

833
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:34,761
Who's going to do it?

834
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:38,056
Who?

835
00:58:45,689 --> 00:58:46,690
What is it?

836
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:49,901
You won't do it? No one?

837
00:58:54,072 --> 00:58:56,742
You shameless punks.

838
00:58:56,825 --> 00:58:59,745
And you call yourselves gangsters?

839
00:59:00,996 --> 00:59:01,997
Goodness.

840
00:59:02,831 --> 00:59:04,249
Move out, you punks!

841
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:07,461
Go gather the boys already!

842
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:10,589
Damn it.

843
00:59:13,884 --> 00:59:15,385
Damn them.

844
00:59:21,475 --> 00:59:23,185
Gosh, that startled me.

845
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:26,021
Great timing.

846
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:31,276
PARK SEOKCHEOL, MYOUNGSAN

847
00:59:32,194 --> 00:59:35,280
Hi, Seokcheol. It's been a while.

848
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:37,532
<i>I know.</i>

849
00:59:37,616 --> 00:59:38,950
Are you feeling all right?

850
00:59:40,202 --> 00:59:41,369
I'm okay now.

851
00:59:41,453 --> 00:59:43,580
<i>I see. That's good news.</i>

852
00:59:44,498 --> 00:59:46,666
So, what are you calling me for?

853
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:48,960
Oh...

854
00:59:50,879 --> 00:59:52,088
I have to ask you something.

855
00:59:52,881 --> 00:59:54,007
Go on.

856
00:59:55,717 --> 00:59:57,219
Why did you do that to me?

857
00:59:58,595 --> 00:59:59,596
Do what, you punk?

858
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:04,559
Why did you try to kill me?
