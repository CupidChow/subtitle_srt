00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:42,960
The Nice Guy

2
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:45,045
THIS DRAMA SERIES IS FICTIONAL,
AND THE PERSONS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,

3
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:46,338
SETTINGS AND EVENTS DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
SERIES HAVE BEEN FICTIONALLY CREATED

4
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:47,506
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN SAFE CONDITIONS

5
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:48,715
WITH THE CONSENT OF
AND IN THE PRESENCE OF GUARDIANS

6
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,593
I want to quit.

7
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:56,348
Take care of that matter
with the third district first.

8
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:57,766
PREVIOUSLY

9
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:59,393
We'll get that third district back.

10
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:02,437
Shouldn't we take Park Seokcheol down
while we're at it?

11
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:05,107
Seokcheol.

12
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:08,068
Thanks for being by my side.

13
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:10,404
Call the Chairman.

14
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,322
Otherwise, it'll lead to war for real.

15
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:16,368
If Changsoo tells you to kill me,
will you do it?

16
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,079
How did we drift apart like this?

17
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,956
I don't want to be on bad terms with you.

18
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:23,542
Same here.

19
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,547
Interested in instruments?

20
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,383
Oh, yes.

21
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:32,509
What's her name?

22
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:36,138
Her name is Kang Miyoung.
We've newly hired her through an audition.

23
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:38,890
"Little Singing Room"?

24
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:40,058
Subscribe.

25
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:43,729
Welcome.

26
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:46,148
It's nice to meet you. I'm Kang Taehoon.

27
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,233
<i>I'd like to hear you sing</i>
<i>from start to finish.</i>

28
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:49,443
<i>Is that okay?</i>

29
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:51,194
- Wait.
- Let go.

30
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:52,279
- Wait.
- Let go of me.

31
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,363
Hear me out!

32
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:56,533
Can't you stop pushing me away?
I also have a heart that breaks.

33
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:57,659
Let go of her.

34
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:02,748
<i>If you keep this up,</i>
<i>it'll get very awkward between us.</i>

35
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,875
<i>I'm not at all at ease</i>
<i>around you either.</i>

36
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:07,544
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

37
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:08,712
What is this?

38
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,088
I resigned today.

39
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:13,675
It must've been tough.

40
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:17,471
You're very much like a tree.

41
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:21,350
Whenever I need a place to rest or hide,

42
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:24,102
you provide me shade like a tree.

43
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:26,104
<i>I'm working. I'm employed.</i>

44
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:27,314
You're employed?

45
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:33,278
<i>It's exhausting,</i>
<i>but I'm at ease.</i>

46
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:34,988
<i>You're now</i>
<i>a man who plants trees,</i>

47
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:36,531
not a man who's like a tree.

48
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:37,616
Where's my mom?

49
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,534
Something good is going on with her.

50
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:42,954
<i>She's moving to a single room today.</i>
<i>Didn't you know?</i>

51
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:46,708
I just thought I'd drop by,
and I saw her sharing a room with others.

52
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:48,335
I thought it'd be uncomfortable.

53
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:49,920
<i>This isn't your room. Let's go.</i>

54
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,839
Can't you at least accept
what I do for your mother?

55
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:54,007
She's your only family.

56
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:57,427
<i>Whoever it may have been,</i>
<i>I would've taken that offer.</i>

57
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:00,889
<i>It's aspiration pneumonia.</i>

58
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:02,641
<i>It's a dangerous symptom</i>
<i>for a dementia patient</i>

59
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:03,934
who has difficulty swallowing.

60
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,853
<i>Let's decide on the operation</i>
<i>once she's stabilized.</i>

61
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:10,357
- The bill is fully paid, right?
- Yes, it's all taken care of.

62
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,484
Just why must you do this much?

63
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:15,821
<i>I may have feelings for you.</i>

64
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:18,323
<i>You need someone who can support you.</i>

65
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:19,741
<i>Taehoon.</i>

66
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:21,451
Stay away from Miyoung.

67
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:24,246
I just did what you couldn't do for her.

68
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:27,249
Don't do anything.

69
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,418
Begin.

70
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,548
Get them all!

71
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:40,595
Please hurry here!

72
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:44,015
<i>What's wrong? Hello?</i>

73
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:53,817
<i>He thinks</i>
<i>it's not just a simple accident,</i>

74
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,610
<i>but an intentional one.</i>

75
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,614
Are you the one
behind Seokcheol's accident?

76
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:00,949
Yes.

77
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:02,033
I am behind it.

78
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:05,036
<i>Do you still mean it?</i>

79
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,915
You said if someone harassed me,
you'd do the same.

80
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:10,500
Of course.

81
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:12,669
<i>Always.</i>

82
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,214
<i>Break up...</i>

83
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:18,341
<i>with Seokcheol.</i>

84
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:29,060
<i>Then at least</i>
<i>he won't get hurt because of me.</i>

85
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:37,486
CEO KANG TAEHOON

86
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,041
Hello?

87
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:56,713
I see.

88
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:00,258
I'll keep the promise I made.

89
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,691
<i>Can we meet up for a moment?</i>

90
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:29,079
Miyoung.

91
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:37,462
Gosh, you became haggard
in just a few days.

92
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:40,715
Did you eat?

93
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:44,261
You hardly eat these days, right?
Let's go eat something first.

94
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,602
What is it? Aren't you hungry?

95
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,690
I have something to tell you.

96
00:05:57,816 --> 00:05:58,817
Go on.

97
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:06,741
I want us to break up.

98
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,462
What are you talking about?

99
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,800
I want us

100
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:26,678
to be strangers to each other.

101
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,683
So, why all of a sudden...

102
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:34,060
Make me understand.

103
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,147
It's not easy for me to say this.

104
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:39,691
So, please just...

105
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:43,028
do as I say without asking more.

106
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:48,533
I was so happy and excited
to be your girlfriend.

107
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:53,913
Just like when we first became lovers,
I've loved you so much...

108
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,834
since we met again.

109
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:00,503
But now,

110
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,757
it's just because of me.

111
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:05,550
It's because of me.

112
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,511
My current situation
is too much to handle.

113
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:12,599
I want us to break up.

114
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,119
It doesn't feel real.

115
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:40,835
Is this right?

116
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,589
Is that the only reason?

117
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:49,594
Yes.

118
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:02,982
Must you do this?

119
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,155
Then, what do we do now?

120
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:13,076
Do we break up just like this?

121
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:22,877
Go.

122
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,588
I'll stay behind.

123
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:32,637
I'm sorry.

124
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:54,451
Miyoung.

125
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,126
If it's too hard,

126
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:05,420
come back.

127
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,383
I'll be waiting.

128
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:35,176
<i>I hoped we'd meet again someday.</i>

129
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:39,222
And when I actually met you again,
I was so happy.

130
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,307
It wasn't just your wish.

131
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:42,892
My prayer was answered too.

132
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,812
Let's never part ways again,
no matter what happens.

133
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,355
Let's never part ways again.

134
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:18,511
<i>I'm happy to have you.</i>

135
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:25,018
<i>What you told me before.</i>

136
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,645
You said if someone harassed me,

137
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:30,106
you'd do the same.

138
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,524
Do you still mean it?

139
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,109
Of course.

140
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:35,445
Always.

141
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,538
<i>Miyoung!</i>

142
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:47,957
Miyoung!

143
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,133
The Nice Guy

144
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,974
<i>It's been 40 minutes.</i>

145
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,601
<i>It has a nice vibe and everything,</i>
<i>so why...</i>

146
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:34,897
<i>You're holding it upside down.</i>

147
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,823
I came to tell you something.

148
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:46,367
What is it?

149
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:49,412
It better not be about 60 to 40.

150
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,580
I'm no longer torn.

151
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:52,749
That's not it.

152
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,084
What is it, then?

153
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:57,462
You want to break up?

154
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:00,506
Seokhee.

155
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:03,593
If that's what you want, let's do that.

156
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:07,346
If you'll be at ease that way,
you can do that.

157
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:09,432
Do you want to break up with me?

158
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:14,062
- No.
- But you want to go to the States?

159
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:22,445
I met the hospital director today.

160
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,783
His daughter told him

161
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,826
that I have a girlfriend.

162
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:31,996
The director said

163
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,915
that whoever I'm dating

164
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,210
is only a one-time girlfriend

165
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,420
whom I'll eventually forget,

166
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,006
and so we should break up.

167
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:44,217
I said,

168
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,553
"Sir, the woman I'm dating

169
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:52,100
"isn't a one-time relationship
that will last only...

170
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:55,103
"in my early years.

171
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,563
"Ever since I was little,

172
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:00,733
"I had a huge crush on her.

173
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,819
"I went after her with all my heart.

174
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:05,780
"And now..."

175
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,158
I love her with all my heart.

176
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,203
Please watch what you say about her.

177
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:14,497
Dr. Jang.

178
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,957
Oh, and...

179
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:19,836
I told you about studying abroad before.

180
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,171
I'm going to go.
I'll go even if you oppose it.

181
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:26,175
Wait, Dr. Jang. Dr. Jang!

182
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,638
Are you out of your mind?

183
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,227
After acting so cool around him,

184
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,814
I regretted it back in my office.

185
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:43,317
But I was...

186
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:45,862
reminded of the past.

187
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:48,030
You know back when

188
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:50,825
we just started dating,

189
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:53,035
I asked you...

190
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:57,373
why you liked me
when I was nothing except for my brain.

191
00:15:57,999 --> 00:15:59,167
You said...

192
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,799
you liked me because I had a dream.

193
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,968
Gosh, I totally...

194
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,847
forgot about it.

195
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,434
Seokhee, I'm coming too.

196
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,228
I'll come with you...

197
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:21,856
and study.

198
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,193
That has been our dream.

199
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,113
I mean it.

200
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:31,616
I really do.

201
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:32,742
Kihong.

202
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:38,331
I'm not going.

203
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:43,419
It's not that I don't want to.

204
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:46,964
I can't.

205
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,051
What are you talking about?

206
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,053
- Seokhee.
- I am

207
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,805
going to spend the money I've saved...

208
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,600
for my family.

209
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:02,271
I'm going to pay off my family's debt.

210
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,317
I've decided to do so.

211
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,778
I think I should.

212
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:12,490
I don't think...

213
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:16,827
I can't

214
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,997
leave my family behind like this.

215
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:24,377
Kihong, I've given up...

216
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,296
on my dream, my future,

217
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,048
and everything.

218
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,932
Oh.

219
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:45,940
Don't cry, Seokhee.

220
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,860
Don't cry.

221
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:54,198
No, cry. It's okay to cry.

222
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:30,985
Hello?

223
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:32,945
Yes.

224
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,033
I'll go right now.

225
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,786
Okay.

226
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,254
Taxi!

227
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,424
To Myoungsan Hospital, please.

228
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,073
- What happened?
- Your mother is in a critical situation.

229
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,200
She's undergoing emergency surgery.

230
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:20,368
Op... operation?

231
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,705
OPERATING ROOM

232
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:52,483
Miyoung.

233
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:54,944
Seokhee.

234
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:58,364
Is she going to be okay?

235
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:01,951
Of course.

236
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:06,372
She'll be okay.
Mom...

237
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:08,499
Everything will be okay.

238
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:34,942
<i>Great job.</i>

239
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,319
<i>It's a really hard one this time.</i>

240
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:44,702
Nice! All of you are like real singers.

241
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:48,706
<i>My daughter is good at singing,</i>
<i>and she's pretty.</i>

242
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:51,709
Since she was little,
we sang a lot together.

243
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:54,295
We'd sing and dance together.

244
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:56,714
What's her name?

245
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:00,050
Kang Miyoung.

246
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,181
<i>How sour is it?</i>

247
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:10,102
Jeez! This is too sour!

248
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,481
Don't be sick, Mom.
Everything will be okay now.

249
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:15,024
You'll support me, right?

250
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:16,609
Yes.

251
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,778
<i>No, Mom, I'm sorry.</i>

252
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:22,156
I can't take you home with me today,
I'm sorry.

253
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:25,117
But I want to go home, Miyoung.

254
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:28,496
I can't leave you there alone
when I go to work.

255
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:31,373
What if you get lost again like that day?

256
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:33,584
Hang in there, okay?

257
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:37,296
Just a little longer, I'm sorry.
Please hang in there.

258
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:38,798
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

<i>Mom, where are we going?</i>

268
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:28,848
It's a secret.

269
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:32,518
<i>Do you remember?</i>

270
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,812
<i>The day you bought me a piano.</i>

271
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:40,943
<i>To find the one</i>
<i>that made the prettiest "do" sound,</i>

272
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,404
<i>I didn't even let the owner</i>
<i>close the shop.</i>

273
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:59,461
<i>I think I promised you something</i>
<i>at the end of that day.</i>

274
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:00,629
<i>I can't remember what it was.</i>

275
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:04,800
<i>What was the promise?</i>

276
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:11,932
Do you like this one?

277
00:23:12,016 --> 00:23:14,184
Yes, I like this one.

278
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:17,146
Miyoung, you look very happy.

279
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:20,316
I feel like I own the world.

280
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:23,736
Then, will you promise me one thing?

281
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:24,820
What?

282
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,825
That you'll remember this moment

283
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:32,161
for a long time.

284
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:35,998
Okay, I promise.

285
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,207
Promise.

286
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:57,728
OPERATING ROOM

287
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,751
CHIEF MOURNER, KANG MIYOUNG

288
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:48,172
Miyoung.

289
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:02,978
Thanks for coming.

290
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:05,898
I'd appreciate your help.

291
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:06,982
We need hands.

292
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:13,530
I put the wreath outside.
Please sign here.

293
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:15,074
Thank you.

294
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:18,160
I'll bring you some food.

295
00:27:43,537 --> 00:27:44,580
Take good care of her.

296
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:27,164
YOON HYESOOK

297
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:49,519
I'm going to move.

298
00:28:52,606 --> 00:28:55,359
I'll move out, settle stuff,

299
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,071
and leave for a trip.

300
00:29:02,032 --> 00:29:04,242
I've never taken my time off even once.

301
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:09,414
Maybe I'll visit my mom's hometown.

302
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:15,837
Why don't I go with you?

303
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:31,979
I know it's hard,

304
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,107
but get yourself together,

305
00:29:37,401 --> 00:29:40,320
don't skip meals, and don't be sick.

306
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:43,323
Take care.

307
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,245
I did it in case you'd get hurt.

308
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:54,376
If I stayed with you,
you'd keep getting hurt.

309
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:57,587
You see,

310
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:00,966
I was truly happy because of you.

311
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:05,220
But if I stayed with you,

312
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:09,016
you'd always get hurt
and sacrifice yourself.

313
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,353
I hate that it happens every time,

314
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:16,106
but there was nothing I could do.

315
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:20,402
So, I broke up with you.

316
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:27,034
I honestly don't think
I can be fine without you.

317
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:32,039
Even now, I want to rely on you.

318
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:35,042
I want to cry in your arms.

319
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:46,136
But if I do this,
something might happen to you,

320
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:47,763
so I can't do anything.

321
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:56,104
I'm sorry.

322
00:30:57,314 --> 00:30:59,691
I should've been more considerate
not to trouble you.

323
00:31:02,903 --> 00:31:05,781
I'm sorry.

324
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:29,971
Thank you for everything.

325
00:31:30,764 --> 00:31:32,224
- Take care.
- You too.

326
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:49,282
Why didn't you answer my calls, Mom?
I was so worried.

327
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:50,450
You called me?

328
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:53,036
See? You got missed calls from me,
your daughter.

329
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,579
You're right.

330
00:31:55,122 --> 00:31:58,375
My daughter's called me so many times.

331
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:03,296
When you get a missed call next time,
click this icon and call me back, okay?

332
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,965
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

333
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:20,230
- Thank you.
- No problem.

334
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:29,614
<i>She's moving out</i>
<i>to pay for the overdue nursing home fee.</i>

335
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:31,491
<i>Too bad for her.</i>

336
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:34,077
<i>Take good care of her.</i>

337
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:39,541
Okay. All right.
I'll be heading off, then.

338
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,418
- Okay.
- Escort her safely.

339
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:43,086
- Got it.
- Thank you.

340
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:44,171
Let's go.

341
00:32:49,426 --> 00:32:50,427
Off you go!

342
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:08,528
ORTHOPEDIST JANG KIHONG

343
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:20,165
<i>Kihong.</i>

344
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,250
<i>I'm not going.</i>

345
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:25,045
It's not that I don't want to.

346
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:26,546
I can't.

347
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:29,174
What are you talking about?

348
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,134
- Seokhee.
- I am

349
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,387
going to spend the money I've saved...

350
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:37,182
for my family.

351
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:41,853
I'm going to pay off my family's debt.

352
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:45,815
I've decided to do so.

353
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:51,321
- Kihong, I'm off.
- Wait.

354
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:53,198
Come talk to me for a bit.

355
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:55,867
Come in.

356
00:33:58,995 --> 00:33:59,996
What is it?

357
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:01,831
Sit down here first.

358
00:34:06,086 --> 00:34:07,087
Ms. Park.

359
00:34:08,922 --> 00:34:10,840
Are you really not going to study abroad?

360
00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:12,467
Are you sure you won't regret it?

361
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:17,305
Talking to you and crying about it
helped me get over it.

362
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:20,976
"Seokhee, you made the right decision."

363
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:26,398
What are you going to do?

364
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,566
You told the director
that you'd go study abroad.

365
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:30,235
How will you take it back?

366
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:32,237
I am...

367
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,739
- going to study abroad.
- What?

368
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:36,825
What about me? You'll leave me behind?

369
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:39,703
Are you betraying me?

370
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:41,871
Go take it back now.

371
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:43,290
Hey, I can't do that.

372
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:45,542
I've already gotten on his bad side.

373
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:47,502
Then, what?

374
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:52,382
You'll leave me behind for real?

375
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,510
No, I can't go without you.

376
00:34:58,555 --> 00:34:59,556
Let's go together.

377
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,017
How?

378
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:03,476
Well, you can just...

379
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:05,478
follow me empty-handed.

380
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:07,564
No way.

381
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,816
I refuse to rip someone off
for my studies abroad.

382
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:12,027
Hey, don't put it that way.

383
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,738
I'll carry you if I must to take you,
so don't worry.

384
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,365
Why are you suddenly being stubborn?

385
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:18,450
I said no.

386
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:21,661
And my mom is against the idea.

387
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:23,330
You know how stubborn she is.

388
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:27,000
If she hears about it,
she'll probably fall sick.

389
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:29,711
I'm off. Bye.

390
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:14,506
Taehoon raided Yeoljeong a few days ago.

391
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:17,842
And we got taken down.

392
00:36:22,472 --> 00:36:25,225
What are you going to do?

393
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:28,311
I'm not sure.

394
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:32,649
I'm exhausted now.

395
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:35,110
Both mentally and physically.

396
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:41,032
This is all because of my indecisiveness.

397
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:42,200
Taehoon didn't

398
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,412
deserve to leave my gang like that.

399
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,039
He sure didn't.

400
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:49,916
He was very good.

401
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,461
I felt burdened to keep him under me.

402
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:54,921
He was that good.

403
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:57,298
He was so good

404
00:36:58,842 --> 00:37:01,553
that I happened to think,

405
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:03,805
"He might outrun me one day."

406
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:09,018
I got scared
he might take everything away.

407
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:12,772
So, I turned a blind eye.

408
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:16,192
I knew he didn't steal any money
from the company.

409
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:19,904
<i>I knew Sangyeol was slandering him.</i>

410
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:21,406
<i>I knew it all,</i>

411
00:37:22,157 --> 00:37:23,408
<i>but I turned a blind eye...</i>

412
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,286
<i>out of fear.</i>

413
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:28,329
<i>But now...</i>

414
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:34,335
...I feel like it all started to go wrong
from then.

415
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,505
I regret it so much.

416
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:42,177
It was the same for me.

417
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:46,473
But over time,

418
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,684
I realized it was because of my pride.

419
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:54,731
When I was in prison,
you took care of my family.

420
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:58,151
<i>Had I let go of my pride,</i>

421
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:01,279
<i>Seokcheol would've been different now.</i>

422
00:38:02,572 --> 00:38:04,407
<i>My pride couldn't stand the fact</i>

423
00:38:05,492 --> 00:38:07,243
<i>that I was taking money from you.</i>

424
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:10,705
<i>That petty pride of mine</i>

425
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:14,751
ruined my son's life.

426
00:38:15,585 --> 00:38:16,586
It was for nothing.

427
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:20,965
Changsoo.

428
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:24,594
If you let go of your pride,

429
00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:30,016
you'll find peace
as if nothing ever happened.

430
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,561
Sir...

431
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,358
My life

432
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:41,402
won't end up being lonely, will it?

433
00:38:42,946 --> 00:38:45,156
You have me by your side.

434
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:47,909
Let go of everything,

435
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:51,454
and we can rely on each other.

436
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:03,466
Take this.

437
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:06,636
What is this?

438
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:09,222
Seokcheol resigned.

439
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:11,850
Consider it his severance pay

440
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:13,184
and accept it, please.

441
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:17,522
Changsoo,

442
00:39:18,398 --> 00:39:21,568
I don't think I can take
any more of your money.

443
00:39:21,651 --> 00:39:22,735
You can call this

444
00:39:23,403 --> 00:39:25,655
my pride acting up again,

445
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:28,199
but take it back.

446
00:39:28,992 --> 00:39:30,118
Instead,

447
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:31,953
do me one favor.

448
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,413
Tell me.

449
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:36,374
My son, Seokcheol, said he'd quit.

450
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:41,087
Let him go on a good note.

451
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,171
Please.

452
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:54,642
Where's Seokcheol?

453
00:39:55,268 --> 00:39:56,269
Did you try reaching him?

454
00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:58,688
He wouldn't answer, sir.

455
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:01,065
He always has his way.

456
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:03,318
Keep the boys under good control.

457
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:06,029
Don't be swayed by his resignation.

458
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:07,989
Have them well-disciplined, okay?

459
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,115
Yes, sir.

460
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:13,453
Anyway, are you going to let him
resign peacefully?

461
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:18,082
Honestly speaking, I believe
he should be treated the same way.

462
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:20,919
We should get him good
even if we don't take his finger.

463
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:23,171
And he's suspicious in many ways.

464
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:26,841
He's away every time something happens.

465
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:30,011
- He's close friends with Taehoon.
- Hey.

466
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:32,847
You're the one who was away
every time something happened.

467
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:34,140
Shut up.

468
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:38,686
I'm going to deal with him,
so stay out of it.

469
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:39,771
Dismissed.

470
00:40:44,484 --> 00:40:45,860
- Younggi.
- Yes.

471
00:40:50,657 --> 00:40:51,658
You also think

472
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:53,618
Seokcheol is

473
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:55,578
suspicious, don't you?

474
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,165
Yes.

475
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:01,459
All right.

476
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:02,627
You may leave.

477
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:18,059
- Be careful.
- Okay.

478
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:20,728
- All done.
- Looks good. Thank you.

479
00:41:22,105 --> 00:41:24,440
- Slowly.
- Eat up.

480
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:26,609
Have some watermelon!

481
00:41:26,693 --> 00:41:29,028
- Let's have some watermelon.
- It's very sweet.

482
00:41:29,112 --> 00:41:30,113
- One each.
- Goodness.

483
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:31,864
Grab a big one.

484
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:32,949
I'm sorry.

485
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:35,284
She suddenly had to move out.
Please let her stay.

486
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:37,620
Don't you worry. We welcome her here.

487
00:41:37,704 --> 00:41:39,622
Of course, at any time.

488
00:41:39,706 --> 00:41:41,249
Don't worry about your stuff.

489
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:44,669
We'll keep it safe with us.

490
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:46,671
Do you want to look around the place?

491
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:48,089
We have a big vegetable garden.

492
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:50,174
Sure.

493
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:51,426
Let's go.

494
00:41:51,968 --> 00:41:53,678
You should have some more.

495
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:55,263
I've had a lot already.

496
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:59,684
Let me take some time off for a trip.

497
00:42:01,144 --> 00:42:03,855
Sure, go and comfort her.

498
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:07,025
Unburden yourself too, while you're at it.

499
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:10,028
But when you come back,
work twice as hard.

500
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:11,821
Of course, I will.

501
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:14,490
How's the watermelon?

502
00:42:14,574 --> 00:42:15,742
- Have some, sir.
- Sure.

503
00:42:15,825 --> 00:42:17,535
- It's so sweet.
- Mmm.

504
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:24,042
This place feels amazing.

505
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,044
Everyone here is so kind.

506
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:30,548
Can you be alone for a while?

507
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,593
I need to go home.

508
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:35,720
Pack up. I'll be back soon.

509
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,479
SAMJUN E&C

510
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:54,781
SEOKCHEOL

511
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:00,328
Meet me for a bit.

512
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:29,190
Hi.

513
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:31,901
What's up?

514
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:35,488
Do we have something left to talk about?

515
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:44,997
Do you like Miyoung?

516
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:53,631
I do.

517
00:43:55,925 --> 00:43:57,009
Can't I?

518
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:02,515
She broke up with me.

519
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,018
I'm guessing it was because of you.

520
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:09,272
I just said okay.

521
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:11,607
I knew it was a lie,

522
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:15,069
but I just followed the decision

523
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:17,280
of the woman I love.

524
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:20,491
To me, that's what love is.

525
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:27,999
No matter what you do, we won't break up.

526
00:44:30,126 --> 00:44:31,669
So, let's stop.

527
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:33,963
No matter what I do?

528
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,925
You may end up getting hurt, Seokcheol.

529
00:44:43,181 --> 00:44:46,309
Then, what are you going to do next?

530
00:44:48,019 --> 00:44:51,480
Are you really going to kill me
over a woman?

531
00:44:58,529 --> 00:44:59,822
You can't do that.

532
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:01,657
That's not who you are.

533
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,622
You're still the same, and so am I.

534
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:09,832
We haven't changed.

535
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:17,798
Let's go back to how things were.

536
00:45:20,468 --> 00:45:21,886
You can do that.

537
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:35,483
What do I get by doing so?

538
00:45:38,945 --> 00:45:40,321
Well...

539
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:42,448
a friend

540
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:46,535
whom you can trust
and eat a meal with at ease.

541
00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:55,795
I'll be in touch.

542
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:00,466
Meals are on you.

543
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:19,151
Oh.

544
00:46:19,235 --> 00:46:21,821
- Mom!
- Hyeonggeun!

545
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:23,364
Goodness.

546
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:25,324
- Did you have fun?
- Yes.

547
00:46:25,408 --> 00:46:26,409
Let's go.

548
00:46:28,953 --> 00:46:30,538
What did you do at school today?

549
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:32,456
I took a dictation test.

550
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:33,582
Dictation?

551
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:35,459
What's your score?

552
00:46:35,543 --> 00:46:36,669
Guess.

553
00:46:37,253 --> 00:46:38,254
Well...

554
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:39,338
Was it 90?

555
00:46:39,422 --> 00:46:40,423
No.

556
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:43,009
No? Then, 80.

557
00:46:43,092 --> 00:46:44,135
70.

558
00:46:44,677 --> 00:46:45,970
No.

559
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:47,054
No?

560
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,390
You don't have to be good at dictation.

561
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:50,808
You'll get better in time.

562
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,853
Don't feel bad, son.

563
00:46:58,524 --> 00:46:59,608
What?

564
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:03,487
Wait. A full score?

565
00:47:03,571 --> 00:47:04,905
Mom, did I do a good job?

566
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:08,326
Aww! Great job, my son.

567
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:10,369
Well done, Hyeonggeun.

568
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:15,875
- Mom, I want this.
- What?

569
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:17,209
- This one?
- Yes.

570
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:18,627
Then, I'll have

571
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:20,212
this one.

572
00:47:20,296 --> 00:47:21,297
Let's go.

573
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:28,929
Hyeonggeun,
tell me some numbers you like.

574
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:31,349
- One.
One.

575
00:47:31,432 --> 00:47:32,767
Good.

576
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:34,602
- What else?
- 100.

577
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:36,354
100? We can't do 100.

578
00:47:36,437 --> 00:47:37,772
Pick a number less than 45.

579
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:41,067
- How about 11?
- Good.

580
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:42,735
- Good.
- And 30.

581
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:43,819
30.

582
00:47:44,362 --> 00:47:45,446
Wait.

583
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:48,532
It's your aunt.

584
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:51,118
- What's up?
<i>What are you up to?</i>

585
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:53,329
Buying a lottery ticket with my son.

586
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:54,914
- <i>A lottery ticket?</i>
- Yes.

587
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:56,624
I'm marking numbers he chooses.

588
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:59,335
<i>Hyeonggeun, make a choice here.</i>

589
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:02,004
What a great thing you're doing
with your son.

590
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:04,632
What are you calling for?

591
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:05,841
Can we meet up for a bit today?

592
00:48:05,925 --> 00:48:08,010
But I have to go to the hair salon soon.

593
00:48:08,636 --> 00:48:11,097
Tell them you'll be a bit late.
We need to go somewhere.

594
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:13,307
<i>Come to the address I text you.</i>

595
00:48:13,391 --> 00:48:14,767
Hey, Seok--

596
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:15,851
Goodness.

597
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:18,521
Are you done?

598
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:21,023
- Let's see. Forty-five.
- Forty-five!

599
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:32,827
- What is it?
- Let's have coffee first.

600
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:33,953
- What do you want?
- Latte.

601
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:36,330
Latte, okay.

602
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:47,633
So, did you buy a lottery ticket?

603
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:50,010
I did.

604
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:51,387
With the numbers my son picked.

605
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:52,638
Unbelievable.

606
00:48:54,098 --> 00:48:55,891
- Let me see.
- What?

607
00:48:55,975 --> 00:48:58,269
- Give me the ticket.
- Why?

608
00:48:58,978 --> 00:49:00,312
Sell it to me.

609
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,606
No.

610
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:04,150
We don't know how it'll turn out.

611
00:49:04,233 --> 00:49:06,861
I'll pay a lot, so hand it to me.

612
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:08,154
No.

613
00:49:08,237 --> 00:49:10,281
I need this for hope's sake.

614
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:19,039
So, how much will you offer?

615
00:49:21,834 --> 00:49:22,835
70 million won.

616
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:25,546
- What?
- My offer is 70 million won.

617
00:49:27,882 --> 00:49:30,968
PROMISSORY NOTE

618
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:36,640
Are you sure

619
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:39,059
you'll lend me the money?

620
00:49:39,143 --> 00:49:40,144
Yes.

621
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:42,438
Pay the interest,
or I'll sue you right away.

622
00:49:43,731 --> 00:49:44,773
Hey, Seokhee.

623
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:46,692
Where did you get this money?

624
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:49,904
I saved it to go to the States.

625
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,698
What about your studies abroad?

626
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:53,949
That?

627
00:49:54,033 --> 00:49:56,452
I'll go if I win this lottery,

628
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:57,953
if not, I won't.

629
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:06,670
Take it before I change my mind.

630
00:50:06,754 --> 00:50:07,755
You won't?

631
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:09,840
Yes, I will.

632
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:12,676
And I will

633
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:14,428
pay you back.

634
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:16,138
Okay?

635
00:50:16,222 --> 00:50:17,306
Hey, Seokhee.

636
00:50:18,224 --> 00:50:19,350
Be my older sister.

637
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:23,270
Just stamp your fingerprint.

638
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:41,163
I've decided to borrow money from Tick.

639
00:50:41,789 --> 00:50:42,790
Are you serious?

640
00:50:43,374 --> 00:50:44,375
Goodness.

641
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:46,502
This is frustrating.

642
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:49,171
What else can I do?

643
00:50:49,255 --> 00:50:51,215
Damn.

644
00:50:57,263 --> 00:50:58,389
What on earth?

645
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:01,725
What? Did something happen again?

646
00:51:01,809 --> 00:51:06,647
No, it says the due date of my house loan
has been extended.

647
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:07,773
What?

648
00:51:08,357 --> 00:51:09,441
What does that mean?

649
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:12,027
No way.

650
00:51:12,111 --> 00:51:15,656
There's no way
it automatically got extended like this.

651
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:16,865
Honey.

652
00:51:16,949 --> 00:51:18,284
Silgon!

653
00:51:18,367 --> 00:51:19,827
What is it?

654
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:23,080
It's paid off. Our house loan is paid off.

655
00:51:23,998 --> 00:51:24,999
What? Who paid it off?

656
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:26,875
Seokkyung. No, Seokhee.

657
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:30,671
With what money?

658
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:35,968
She paid it off with the money
she saved for her studies abroad.

659
00:51:37,678 --> 00:51:40,014
Oh, goodness. Seokhee did

660
00:51:40,598 --> 00:51:41,932
something truly big.

661
00:51:42,016 --> 00:51:44,393
I'm so proud of her.

662
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:47,146
She's like your eldest daughter,
not youngest.

663
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:48,897
The eldest daughter of this family!

664
00:51:48,981 --> 00:51:50,566
Goodness, how commendable.

665
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:58,282
HAIR SALON

666
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:03,245
<i>Hey, Seokhee.</i>

667
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:05,164
<i>Where did you get this money?</i>

668
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:07,166
<i>I saved it to go to the States.</i>

669
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:08,834
<i>What about</i>
<i>your studies abroad?</i>

670
00:52:12,254 --> 00:52:13,505
<i>I'll pay you back.</i>

671
00:52:22,431 --> 00:52:23,432
<i>Go.</i>

672
00:52:24,183 --> 00:52:27,394
Do what you want in life
before it's too late.

673
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:29,897
This is upsetting.

674
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:32,983
You're willing to send your daughter off
to live in the States.

675
00:52:33,067 --> 00:52:34,777
If I tell you not to go, will you listen?

676
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,379
Goodness.

677
00:52:53,462 --> 00:52:54,463
Silgon.

678
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:56,382
You must be devastated.

679
00:52:57,758 --> 00:52:59,510
Let me drink some too.

680
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:05,557
Your wife is at my place.

681
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:09,269
She cried her eyes out,
feeling deeply sorry for Seokhee.

682
00:53:09,937 --> 00:53:12,398
It must be worse for you.

683
00:53:13,357 --> 00:53:14,358
Daegi.

684
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:17,361
When I was younger,

685
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:23,450
I failed to be a warm father to my kids.

686
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:27,121
Now in my later years...

687
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:28,831
...I've failed to be

688
00:53:29,832 --> 00:53:32,042
a reliable father to my kids.

689
00:53:34,795 --> 00:53:35,796
I...

690
00:53:36,839 --> 00:53:37,840
I...

691
00:53:38,757 --> 00:53:39,758
I ruined...

692
00:53:40,801 --> 00:53:42,928
my daughter's future.

693
00:53:45,139 --> 00:53:47,641
How pathetic of me.

694
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,310
My life is pathetic.

695
00:53:50,394 --> 00:53:51,395
Goodness.

696
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:54,898
MYOUNGSAN INDUSTRIES

697
00:53:58,902 --> 00:53:59,987
Hello, sir.

698
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:04,324
- Is the Chairman inside?
- Yes, he is.

699
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:09,830
- Where have you been?
- It's none of your business.

700
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:11,498
CEO'S OFFICE

701
00:54:12,833 --> 00:54:15,002
Sir, I'm coming in.

702
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:26,138
Where did he go this time?

703
00:54:26,889 --> 00:54:30,017
These bastards don't even know
if he's inside or not.

704
00:54:40,861 --> 00:54:41,862
Mr. Chairman.

705
00:54:42,404 --> 00:54:44,031
Mr. Chairman!

706
00:54:47,326 --> 00:54:48,494
Damn it.

707
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,127
Is this 911?

708
00:55:40,629 --> 00:55:42,673
I found a person unconscious.

709
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,342
You better hurry here.

710
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,220
Yes, it's urgent.

711
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:50,722
Yes.

712
00:55:51,265 --> 00:55:52,683
Oh, the address is...

713
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:59,064
I feel so relaxed to be here.

714
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:02,901
I don't even remember
the tough times I had.

715
00:56:03,569 --> 00:56:04,653
It's the same for us.

716
00:56:04,736 --> 00:56:08,198
Working here has made us feel more at ease
and happier.

717
00:56:09,408 --> 00:56:13,203
Sadness is bound to fade away in time
after all.

718
00:56:14,663 --> 00:56:17,124
When Seokcheol came here,
I was very surprised.

719
00:56:17,666 --> 00:56:19,585
It's easier said than done

720
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:22,004
to leave a field like that.

721
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:26,592
I didn't think he'd be able to adapt,
but this dude actually loves it.

722
00:56:26,675 --> 00:56:29,011
He looks much brighter too.

723
00:56:32,139 --> 00:56:33,140
Over there.

724
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:38,562
That's where he used to sit down
and read books.

725
00:56:39,021 --> 00:56:40,355
Take a seat there.

726
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:45,861
Go on and sit.

727
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:47,863
Get some rest.

728
00:56:48,572 --> 00:56:49,656
Oh, right.

729
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:54,953
Seokcheol once told me
that someone said he was like a tree.

730
00:56:55,704 --> 00:56:57,205
Was it you?

731
00:56:58,915 --> 00:57:00,542
Yes.

732
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:05,756
Nothing seems lonelier than a tree
that stands alone in the wilderness.

733
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:08,342
Do stay with him for a long time.

734
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:10,761
Sure.

735
00:57:11,345 --> 00:57:12,763
I'll let you rest, then.

736
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:30,405
Seokcheol.

737
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:32,407
Are you going somewhere?

738
00:57:33,367 --> 00:57:34,993
Yes, I'm going on a trip.

739
00:57:35,077 --> 00:57:36,078
For a few days.

740
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:38,580
- With Miyoung?
- Yes.

741
00:57:38,664 --> 00:57:41,041
Good. Go and comfort her.

742
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:43,293
You're the only one she has now.

743
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:47,547
Seeing you take care of her
at her mother's funeral,

744
00:57:47,631 --> 00:57:50,008
I had to admit that my brother was cool.

745
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:57,265
I'm sorry that I'll be away
despite your situation.

746
00:57:57,349 --> 00:57:58,684
Oh, forget it.

747
00:57:58,767 --> 00:58:00,977
We'll be okay here,
so go and have fun with her.

748
00:58:02,062 --> 00:58:03,522
Okay, I'll see you when I'm back.

749
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:04,773
Okay.

750
00:58:20,706 --> 00:58:23,208
Fortunately, he's stabilized.

751
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:26,420
Are you perhaps a family member?

752
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:29,089
Well, yes.

753
00:58:29,673 --> 00:58:30,966
I'm his family.

754
00:58:31,717 --> 00:58:34,845
He needs to be operated on immediately,
or he'll be in a grave condition.

755
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:36,471
"Grave"?

756
00:58:37,681 --> 00:58:38,974
How bad is it?

757
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:40,600
Uh...

758
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:42,352
He has a brain tumor.

759
00:58:42,436 --> 00:58:45,814
I kept stressing to him
why he needed an operation,

760
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:47,899
but he was adamant about not doing it.

761
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:50,402
Well...

762
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:57,033
Then, does it mean
he doesn't have many days to live?

763
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:13,091
<i>It's me.</i>

764
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:16,803
Get that bastard
by any means possible, okay?

765
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:18,388
Okay, bye.

766
00:59:19,681 --> 00:59:21,057
All right.

767
00:59:21,141 --> 00:59:24,102
Let's raise some real hell.

768
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:28,607
Yes, I'll be there in an hour.

769
00:59:30,025 --> 00:59:31,109
Be careful on the way.

770
00:59:31,193 --> 00:59:32,944
Okay, I'll see you soon. Bye.

771
00:59:46,625 --> 00:59:47,626
Sir.

772
00:59:47,709 --> 00:59:49,503
We need you to come with us.

773
00:59:51,171 --> 00:59:52,172
Must you do this?

774
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:53,423
We're sorry.

775
00:59:53,965 --> 00:59:55,300
Sangyeol wants to bring you over.
