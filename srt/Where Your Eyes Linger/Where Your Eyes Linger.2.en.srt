Did something bad happen to you?

00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,040
No.

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,440
Then, why did you do that?

8
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:30,360
I don't like that bastard.

Look at yourself before calling someone cute.

Hey! Don't you remember getting caught in my armbar?

13
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,730
Now I might even fight better than you.

Didn't I tell you not to say something like that even as a joke?

Yeah, I'm sorry.

It's not even the first nor second time you've seen it.

34

So what's with you suddenly?

35
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,910
- Who's that? 
 - I don't know.

36
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:15,700
- Take a look at it. 
 - No need.

Kang Gook? 

38
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:22,900
Why did you give me a different phone number?

What is it?

40
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,920
Did you tell her?

41
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,430
- Why? Isn't it fun? 
 - It's not fun for me.

42

It's just a gift. Don't resent me later. I'm telling you to go ahead and experiment with everything you want.

Is he your ideal type?

46

No, its a weird guy.

47
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:09,110
His name is Kang Gook, even his name is handsome.

It looks like a relationship that you shouldn't meddle in.

There's no way.

Do it. It's an order.

You can't do this here. This is the only place where I can act impudently with you.

What's the matter?

67
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:52,170
You know I have to touch your ear to calm down.

68
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,320
Even then, it's a no.

00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:29,220
I'm sorry, I didn't do it on purpose. 
 - As expected.

Why? Did he call?

77
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:37,610
- He didn't do it on purpose. 
 - Well, of course, I'd be happy to get a handsome son-in-law.

My heart fluttered for the first time in a while.

You can just wash up well, making sure you don't make it wet.

You sprained my arm and all. Dammit, it's so uncomfortable.

105

Just taking off my jacket is difficult. How am I going to do from now on?
