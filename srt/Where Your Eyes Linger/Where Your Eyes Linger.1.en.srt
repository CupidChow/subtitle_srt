[Where Your Eyes Linger] 

4
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,880
Han Tae Joo, you son of a bitch!

5
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,720
- Stop right there, you buffoon! 
 - Stop running after me!

7
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,050
You, go that way.

8
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:55,510
You're damn fast, aren't you?

9
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:57,120
All right.

10
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,870
With Min Gyeong, I thought, "Well, it can happen."

11
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,290
But the three of them, that's overdoing it!

12
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:05,730
Why are you guys so tall, dammit.

13
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:07,470
Min Gyeong?

14
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,950
She was pretty, that's true. Though she was a bit short.

15
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:12,720
Do you want to die?

16
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,680
And Hyeon Jeong, then?

17
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,360
I was hardcore in love with her!

18
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,750
- She is the one who came to me first— 
 - I'm on the verge of being traumatized, right now.

19
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:23,250
Even though I don't like the Christian religion, the faithful Kki Ppeum...

20
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,510
I was sure Kki Ppeum would never be like that.

21
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:28,530
- Kki Ppeum was indeed the most charming of them all. 
 - Hey!

22
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,700
Why is this guy so conceited?

23
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,920
Even in terms of looks, I'm more... Don't you think?

24
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:42,660
If you hit me, you'll have a hard time dealing with the aftermath.

25
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,530
My dad is a board director at TB Group, you buffoon.

26
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,500
You're laughing?

27
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,370
So you keep laughing, uh?

28
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:56,940
You're laughing?

29
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:15,380
- Were you the one who did it? 
 - Go easy on him.

30
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,580
I was wondering why you didn't appear.

31
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,700
You're this buffoon's servant, aren't you?

32
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,150
That's right, I am.

33
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:29,100
Wait, but this darned servant—

34
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,400
Are you okay?

35
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,020
What should you do?

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,520
My dad is the chairman of TB Group.

37
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,890
 We are long-time friends, 

38
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:01,450
 but it's a disguise for a master-servant relationship.

 [Episode 1 - Bad habit] 

40
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,330
I don't think I told you to play house

41
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:20,900
when I assigned you to Tae Joo.

42
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,110
I apologize.

43
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:26,050
It wasn't playing house!

44
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:27,820
It really hurt.

45
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:31,170
So you haven't fixed your habit yet, I see.

46
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,970
I'm telling you that I got hit in order to avoid making an issue, this time.

47
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:36,530
Han Tae Joo.

48
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:39,100
When you do something wrong,

49
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,700
I'll beat Gook every time.

50
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,710
If this kind of thing happens one more time,

51
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:48,880
I'll send you to England, so keep that in mind.

52
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,770
I got you a house so that you would live quietly without drawing attention.

53
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,770
Be careful of how you behave.

54
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:01,700
- Yes, Sir. 
 - Yes.

55
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,820
I'm sorry.

56
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,520
For what?

57
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:29,050
Who would have thought that taking the blow would be worse?

58
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:32,550
In the future, don't take it and just hit them.

59
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:36,760
That'd be better, right?

60
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,900
By the way, how can you tell them you're the chairman's son?

61
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,800
Dammit, that jerk was the one who was acting up.

62
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,620
He was saying his dad was a board director.

63
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,710
Would I not be dumbfounded in that situation?

64
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,460
We're going through these troubles on purpose to not be caught.

65
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,160
Let's be careful, all right?

66
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:00,570
What? "Troubles?"

67
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,340
Did you say that they were troubles?

68
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:07,250
I'm enjoying it, though.

69
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,950
I'm happy.

70
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,550
Are you not happy?

71
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,820
You can eat as much chicken as you want,

72
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,510
play games all night with me,

73
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:30,370
and make some ramen to eat as well.

74
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:36,490
Right, I'm happy too.

75
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,810
Darling, I don't want to go to England.

76
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:45,440
- Don't do these things. 
 - Why not?

77
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,400
Come on. Do you want to die?

78
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,920
Oh my goodness!  Hey!

79
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,680
Get off.

80
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:57,600
Hey! Are you all right?

81
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,570
I told you not to do it!

82
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:01,760
Dammit.

83
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,010
What were you pretending?

84
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:05,460
- Were you worried? 
 - Yes.

85
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,340
Here I come with my skills.

86
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,390
You got scared.

87
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:12,230
You still can't win against me.

88
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,820
You want to act up, Han Tae Joo?

89
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,450
Try to act up again.

90
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:18,640
Weak point attack.

91
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:37,080
Tae Joo has a bad habit.

92
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,840
Here.

93
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,940
It's pretty.

94
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,540
It's tasty.

95
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,970
And it's nice because there's no one from school.

96
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:58,310
But your taste, I'm not sure...

97
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,480
What?

98
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,840
I should approve of it, right?

99
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,900
- Approval? 
 - Approval.

100
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:07,570
Hello.

101
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:11,060
We opened only recently.

102
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:18,170
By the way, looking at you...

103
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,030
You are the attacker? And you are the defense? 
 (T/N: jargon, similar to "top" and "bottom")

104
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:24,690
- Pardon? 
 - Sorry?

105
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,230
Nothing.

106
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,800
Attack? Defense?

107
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,240
Ah! You really startled me!

108
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,800
Sorry.

109
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,010
It's because of the fine dust.

110
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:45,150
This is that boy.

111
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:47,330
My first customer.

112
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:51,110
It had lifted my mood because he was so good-looking.

113
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:55,200
It's you?

114
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,210
So, do you approve of my taste?

115
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:03,960
A little bit.

116
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,190
What's with you?

117
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,880
Why are you following us?

118
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:20,120
My mom kept telling me about you.

119
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,500
But you are better than I thought.

120
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,390
Hey. Usually, people look at me rather than him.

121
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:27,910
Sure.

122
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:35,050
Your number, please.

123
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:38,240
Woah! So, not my number,

124
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,270
but Kang Gook's number?

125
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,720
Here you go.

126
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:57,290
Then I'll see you later!

127
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:07,020
Hey. What was that?

128
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,560
What?

129
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,000
You went around flirting while I was in Japan.

130
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:15,470
I also saw her for the first time today.

131
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,150
You're pretending to be all serious and cool,

132
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,640
all by yourself, I see.

133
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,710
What are you saying?

134
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,730
Are you happy that you gave her your number?

135
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:29,710
I didn't give it to her.

136
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,310
What, then?

137
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:36,300
A fake number.

138
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,870
Really?

139
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,710
Okay.

140
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,930
I'm thirsty.

141
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:47,290
So?

142
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:49,910
Buy chocolate milk for me.

143
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,280
You should buy it for yourself. You're rich.

144
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,000
Hey, buy it for me!

145
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,540
Really, you want to die?

146
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,030
Hey.

147
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,250
Hey, are you really my bodyguard?

148
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,190
What's this?

149
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:11,110
You weren't done?

150
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,910
I'm sorry.

151
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,980
I don't know why either,

152
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:21,220
but my dad told me to apologize to you. It's seriously hurting my pride.

153
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,530
I'll accept it.

154
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:29,050
This society is crappy, after all.

155
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:33,610
But, are you really the son of the chairman of TB group?

156
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,290
No.

157
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:37,840
Even if he was, it's none of your concern.

158
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,710
Sure.

159
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:42,040
I apologized, so we're set.

160
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:49,190
You can't touch my fourth girlfriend. Be careful.

161
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:54,740
- Hey! 
 - What are you doing?

162
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,690
I'm sorry.

163
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:59,180
- Let's be close. 
 - Are you nuts?

164
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:02,640
We should be close if you want me to avoid snatching your fourth girlfriend.

165
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,180
Hey!

166
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:13,490
Tae Joo has a bad habit.

167
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:15,440
That bad habit...

168
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,870
should be changed.

169
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:26,260
♫ Baby you, you are especially dazzling today ♫

170
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:30,040
[Where Your Eyes Linger]

171
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,990
♫  Before I know it, you whisper to me ♫

172
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:39,140
♫  Once you touch my frozen heart, ♫

173
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:47,480
♫  it starts to melt for you  ♫
