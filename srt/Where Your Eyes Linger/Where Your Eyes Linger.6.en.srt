Han Taejoo is being like that because he got hit by the ball, right?

Seriously, why is his personality like that?

Seeing as we have no customers, will we be okay?

Congrats.

35

- Mom. 
 - Yeah?

36
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,650
People get jealous in friendships, too. Right?

37
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,820
They do. It happens often.

38

Han Taejoo, I asked you for a favor.

49

- What are you doing? 
 - Stop avoiding the subject and tell me. Why'd you do that?

50
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:46,380
You said since we're doing this for life, no matter what the problem is, we have to resolve all of them.

Don't push it, seriously.

58

Adapting to your whining is really my limit now.

59
