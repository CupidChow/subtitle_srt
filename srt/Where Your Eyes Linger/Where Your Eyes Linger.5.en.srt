00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,740
Hey! Just because I told you to walk, did you really have to walk?

8
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:26,400
You should've taken a bus or a taxi.

9
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,380
You're acting as you please again.

10

12
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:25,470
Why did I do that to you?

13
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,820
Because you're mean.

14
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,480
This is different.

15
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,700
It was another kind of anger.

16
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,700
Have you felt like that towards me, too?

17
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,700
I don't know what you are talking about.

18
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,900
Hug me.

19
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:15,370
Like my mom.

I asked you a favor.

22

I'm sad.

23
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,240
I don't get why we have to do physical education.

24
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,580
Isn't it better than studying?

25
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,920
I think studying is better.

26

Suit yourself.

It's dodgeball today; your class against mine.

29
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,880
So what? Don't you have any friends?

30
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,230
Why are you coming over here to cause a ruckus?

31
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,920
I really don't have any friends.

32
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,650
I couldn't make any.

33
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,350
You really have a bad personality.

34

What?

35
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:04,740
Okay, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

Our class, fighting!

What are you doing, leaving your own classmates aside?

39
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,820
Because I have no friends. I'm sorry.

- It's annoying. 
 - Stop it already.

- Of course. 
 - What do you mean, "Of course?"

43
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,180
- What do you think this is? 
 - Then you can leave.

44
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,340
You can guard me well so that the ball doesn't hit me.

45
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:40,980
It's my specialty, after all. Since I'm a real bodyguard.

He says he's a real bodyguard. How funny!

- You can't get influenced by him, got it? 
 - Okay.

Why? Don't you find this funny? This is really funny.
