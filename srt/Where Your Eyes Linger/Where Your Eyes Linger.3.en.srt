00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,880
It tickles.

7
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:56,380
Bear with it.

8
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:38,750
This reminds me of my mom.

9
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:42,820
Mom also did this sometimes.

10

Aren't you going to wash up?

11
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,790
You should wash up, too.

12
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,690
I'll do it later.

13
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,690
I told you it tickles.

14

You should wash up, too.

15

 [Episode 3: The moment I want to run away]

So just wash up already.

19
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,570
I'll wash up later.

20
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,300
Did you reply to her?

21
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,910
I'm going to try to meet up with her this Saturday.

22
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:39,420
I'll pop out while you're being tutored.

23
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,200
Wow!

24
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:45,530
You're making plans on your own and reporting them to me.

25
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:47,410
You're being weird.

26
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,740
You told me to date.

27
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,490
Careful! You have to dry my shiny hair with care.

28
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,580
That's right.

29
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:08,800
You really made this well.

30
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,230
But you shouldn't neglect me just because you are dating.

31
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,510
That'd be good.

32
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:22,200
What?

33
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,160
What did you just say?

34
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,630
(I'd like to.)

35
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,490
But have you ever dated before?

36
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,780
You haven't even done it once.

37
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:52,550
Oh, Kang Gook. You're obviously gruff.

38
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:55,080
I don't think it'll be any good.

39
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,850
This big brother will teach you a little tomorrow.

40
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:00,920
What do you think? Aren't you thankful?

41
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,300
I'm not really that thankful.

42
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,220
You are!

43
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,350
Be careful with your hand.

44
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:08,120
Yes.

45
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,800
How could you... to my friend...?

46
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,500
Friend?

47
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,220
I saw you give her the same present.

48
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,000
You jerk!

49
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:43,340
I'm not allowed to take my eyes off you.

50
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:54,610
Even when I want to close my eyes, because of that, I can't.

51
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:07,170
I want to run away.

What are you doing?

55
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:36,260
You have good manners and you have a handsome face, too.

Everything is fine, except for the fact that you're bad at talking.

68

How could you just be staring like that? You got to ask a question then start a conversation.

Cool place.

75
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:57,920
You like making stuff, to make yourself look good. You could talk about art and things like that.

76
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,520
I told you I'm not going to do it.

77

Try it out. I thought it was a good idea.

But you're saying that a cool girl like Seong Mingyeong went to hunt you down.

No, forget about that for now. I told you we have to coach Kang Gook on his date right now.

All right.

85
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:27,630

It's not the fourth one. It's the new transfer student.

Hey, you...!

94
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:59,550
You said Mingyeong came over to fight! Why did you kiss her? The beginning and end don't make sense!

95
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,390
Don't you know about the angry kiss?

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,030
You still have got a lot to learn. Don't you?

100
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:16,890
Wait a moment. Am I the only one who doesn't know? What does that mean?

00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:19,360
- Kim Pilhyeon!

What do you trust about him, to be so friendly with him?

106
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,210
Isn't it a bit boring when it's just the two of us?

107
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:59,370
What do you think? Your heart fluttered, right?

108
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,420
Dating is something like this.

109

I asked if your heart fluttered.

You are angry. Aren't you?

115

Stop doing things like this.
