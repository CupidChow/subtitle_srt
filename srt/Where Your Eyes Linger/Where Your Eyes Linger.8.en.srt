♫ Baby you, you are especially dazzling today ♫

[Episode 8 - Because I like you]

5
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:39,860
Let him come in.

6
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:56,770
Despite this, you were good as a bodyguard, Gook.

7
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:57,500
I'm sorry—

8
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,830
Try explaining why you had to walk in here

9
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:03,090
with your own feet.

10
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:07,000
I know I cannot win.

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,680
Since I don't have anything, but you have everything, Chairman.

12
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,750
So...

13
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:26,830
You must've known all of this, but you threw away the rest of your life over a mistake you made in one moment.

14
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:29,490
I came to just talk for five minutes.

15
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:40,930
After all, we were together for 15 years. I thought we should talk just for five minutes.

16
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:54,220
I told you that I'll hit Gook if you did something wrong.

17
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:02,970
I'll go.

18
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:06,550
I'll go to England.

19
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,830
After going?

20
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,890
After going...

21
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:17,790
Without anyone...

22
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:22,640
I will study alone and also go to university.

23
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,830
I'll do well.

24
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:28,870
How can I believe that?

25
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:31,870
Isn't it enough if I go tomorrow?

26
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:36,500
I can really do well.

27
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,000
Believe me just this once.

28
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:44,050
I'll really show you.

29
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:49,140
Get Han Taejoo's plane ticket for tomorrow.

30
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,670
Go ahead with what was planned.

31
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,500
In return,

32
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:00,510
just for a moment...

33
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:13,630
Just for today... I'll go home and come back.

34
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:35,330
I made it so that you're free. Why would you come?

35
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,410
Are you asking because you don't know?

36
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,000
I don't want to go to England.

37
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,540
I'm sorry.

38
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,290
Kim Pilhyeon, that crazy bastard. I want to kill him.

39
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,820
What did we do that it's already dawn?

40
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:37,120
I don't know since when, but I've wanted to keep hugging you.

41
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,980
I like you.

42
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,740
What kind of confession are you doing to someone who's flying in a few hours?

43
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:08,840
To England... have a safe trip, Taejoo.

44
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:19,020
If you're going to be like this, you should've just accepted when I tried to kiss you that time?

45
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,300
We didn't even get to do that.

46
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:29,260
Am I a pervert

47
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:32,420
to kiss someone whose lips are bleeding?

48
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,570
I'll be able to see you again, right?

49
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:45,150
Look for another delicious rice cake place.

50
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,400
I'll come back.

51
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,350
You shouldn't.

52
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:58,950
You and I have different paths to walk. Just enjoy your time over there—

53
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:04,130
My dream is to live happily,

54
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:12,830
but I'm the happiest when I'm together with you.

55
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:17,030
So, I'll come back.

56
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,560
I'm not allowed to take my eyes off of you.

57
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:27,120
You're not allowed to take your eyes off of me.

58
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:40,560
Even when I want to close my eyes,

59
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:45,400
because of that, I can't.

60
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:53,630
Even when you want to close your eyes,

61
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,260
because of that, you can't.

62
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:14,800
- Because I like you. 
  - Because I like you.

63

♫ Suddenly, far away ♫

64
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:21,370
♫ You are far away ♫

65
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:28,190
♫ In the shadow, I wander looking for you ♫

66
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,630
♫ Among countless moments that made me sway ♫

67
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:37,080
♫ You brush by me ♫

68
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:43,070
♫ Bring me out from the hollowness I am locked in ♫

69
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:46,550
♫ I've been lost ♫

70
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:51,950
♫ In my recurring pain ♫

71
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:54,820
- I want to runaway.
 - I want to runaway.

72
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,850
♫ Please save me ♫

73
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:04,590
♫ Always by my side, light it up ♫

74
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:10,190
♫ I want to break away from the darkness ♫

75
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,420
♫ Show me your light ♫

76
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:18,000
♫ Shine on me ♫

77
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:25,690
♫ Among the countless times that you made me sway, 
you brush by me ♫

78
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:33,540
Having a rice cake place that it's this successful wasn't what I wished for.

79
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:36,370
Don't complain about this.

80
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,830
Gook, are you really going to leave?

81
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:46,590
Yes, I should go.

82
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:01,960
But... why is it Japan?

83
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,720
I just wanted to go there once.

84
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,830
When are you coming back?

85
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:11,980
When nothing comes to mind anymore.

86
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:23,830
Because I can't see a handsome Gook like you, how do I keep living?

87
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:28,120
How do I keep living by just looking at her?

88
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,200
Mom, calm down a bit.

89
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:42,530
Take it. Think of it as your pay for working part-time.

90
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,880
Thank you, Ma'am.

91
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,650
Hyemi.

92
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:56,890
Ugh, what a pain!

93
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,680
Do you really have to go?

94
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,260
I'll call you often.

95
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,720
For sure?

96
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,450
For sure.

97
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:12,620
Do you know how long I waited for this day?

98
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,820
- Cream... 
 - I was scared since you were next to Hyemi!

99
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:22,270
Our Gook is way more handsome than Pilhyeon.

100
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,760
And more mature.

101
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,620
Mother.

102
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,240
Don't you have a gift for me?

103
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,870
I ordered it, but it hasn't been delivered yet.

104
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,820
I'm sorry.

105
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,660
Is college fun?

106
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:39,170
I don't know. We always just learn weird things.

107
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,380
Should I also go and study abroad?

108
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,310
Are you an idiot?

109
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:54,400
Have a safe trip, you bastard.

110
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,100
You better call often.

111
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,420
- It's been a long time. 
 - Hey!

112
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:03,760
That means it's been a long time. Did you meet him for the first time in a long time?

113
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,050
Our Gook.

114
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:26,370
He's such a frail boy.

115
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:29,440
How can he live anywhere on his own?

116
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,590
That bastard isn't weak, Mother.

117
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:38,620
Damn it! I told him not to go.

118
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,320
Did you call Taejoo?

119
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,800
- Yeah.
 - What did he say?

120
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,320
He didn't say much?

121
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,760
I don't know. I told him that Gook is going to Japan but he didn't say anything.

122
00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:02,120
Our little Gook. Our frail little Gook.

123
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:06,420
Without Taejoo, what's he going to do?

124
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,700
How can he live like that?

125
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,470
What is he going to do?

126
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:13,750
Mother, I'm telling you, Kang Gook isn't weak!

127
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:18,810
But it's time for him to be here.

128
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,010
Hello. I came for the interview.

129
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,970
Damn it! I'll get my spot stolen again.

130
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:52,090
It's been three years since Taejoo left.

131
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:55,210
Taejoo hadn't come back and

132
00:12:55,210 --> 00:13:00,380
I'm leaving for Japan to forget about Taejoo.
