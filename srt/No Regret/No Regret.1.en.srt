1
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:35,215
See you tomorrow.

2
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,342
Bye bye, Mr. chauffeur.

3
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:56,364
Hello...

4
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:10,439
Came home early?

5
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:13,547
You?
Another driving service?

6
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:17,415
Aren't you tired?

7
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:20,116
Got a big tip for some throw up.

8
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,488
Aw, fucking pigs.
Why don't they drink less?

9
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:31,895
I know you're into studying and side jobs
but pay some attention to factory work.

10
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:36,202
Didn't you hear about the lay-offs?

11
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,902
You've been working for a year now.

12
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:41,674
Why grumble?
No hot chic tonight?

13
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:43,210
Hey, Su-min.

14
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:46,909
What?

15
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:49,211
Are my hands that chapped?

16
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:50,754
What about it?

17
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:56,892
I hooked up a sexy girl tonight.

18
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:00,022
Well, it was going right.

19
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:02,694
But guess what she said.

20
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:07,667
"Honey, why your hands are so chapped?"

21
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:08,565
So?

22
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:10,835
So I said

23
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:17,544
"'Cause my hands play golf.
Be on that, I see your face plays golf."

24
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:21,677
Stop laughing, fucker.
It's a shame...

25
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:26,723
Without this brace
I couldn't even count the girls in a queue.

26
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:30,396
Why? Because I look so great.
Oh, fucking handsome...

27
00:05:30,431 --> 00:05:31,556
Girls are such big attraction to you?

28
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:34,728
Yup, You are still after guys?

29
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:39,969
Everyone from the orphanage knows that.

30
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:41,965
Hwan-sun is a blabbermouth, you know.

31
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:46,343
It's that you've never tasted a girl.

32
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:50,107
OK, It's my shot.
Let's visit a cathouse.

33
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:54,880
By the way, have you ever fucked a guy?

34
00:05:57,824 --> 00:06:02,124
Get wise, man!
Underdogs like us need family.

35
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,226
Boy, I'm starving.
Gonna have Ramen.

36
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:15,703
Hello?

37
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:35,158
Sir, did you call for the driving service?

38
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:40,660
It's at the parking lot
3524.

39
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,794
Sorry? I beg your pardon?

40
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:53,070
Thank you, sir.

41
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:21,505
Play some CD, please.

42
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:19,087
I'm sorry to trouble you.
Thought I got money in my wallet.

43
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:20,689
No problem.

44
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:23,095
Thank you.

45
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:26,269
Are... you busy right now?

46
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,639
I'm gonna have another drink.
Why don't you join?

47
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:33,667
Gotta work.

48
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:36,414
Frankly...

49
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:43,146
I had money in the wallet.

50
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:50,187
What's your name?

51
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,466
Are you sick?

52
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:08,671
What's wrong?

53
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,019
Fucking bastards!
What's with this fucking atmosphere!

54
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:27,452
Poor Kwang-soo...
His daughter's preparing for a college.

55
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:31,995
You can say that again.
Shit! What about our overtime work?

56
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:35,859
Fuck it all!
So I've always been proposing the union!

57
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:38,260
With mamas at the nightclub?

58
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,808
Hey! What happened?

59
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:50,714
You're fired, too?

60
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:54,377
Assholes treat non-regulars like shit.

61
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:57,854
20 men at one stroke!
Kill 'em all...

62
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:02,283
Good morning.
Good morning.

63
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,824
Bullshit! Fucking irritating!

64
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:09,958
Why?

65
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:24,876
Know him?
High-handed personnel?

66
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:27,545
He's the son of our CEO.

67
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:30,213
Foul bastard's wheat-floured face sucks!

68
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:40,662
Don't tell anybody.

69
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:46,632
Jong-ho at #2 was fired in place of you.

70
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:57,241
You got fired but he pulled the string.

71
00:11:57,416 --> 00:12:00,112
And he saved your ass.

72
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:13,393
You can't enter...

73
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,399
Had no idea you're working here.
If I knew earlier...

74
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:29,776
Oh, sorry.
It's quite messy around here.

75
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:36,120
You... quit the driving service, didn't you?

76
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:39,790
I've called once...

77
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:45,193
I appreciate your kindness...
But you suckers try this on!

78
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:54,603
Come on, Su-min.

79
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:59,938
If you quit like this
you've got to give up the retirement pay.

80
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,079
Hey, where are you going?

81
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:42,250
Hwan-sun, it's me...

82
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,655
Is there a vacancy for me?

83
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:05,373
Pretty good money in here.

84
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:08,077
Look, he earned 10 million last month.

85
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:11,207
You just have to let your pride sleep.

86
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,415
Put something on when sleeping, bitch.

87
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:17,550
Indecent!

88
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:24,853
Does...
Hwan-sun knows this?

89
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:28,491
Nope, He just thinks it as a karaoke.

90
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,230
Would you brad about working here?

91
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,297
Money is the root of all evil.

92
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:39,877
If you're reluctant, just don't.

93
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:41,777
Go wash the dishes or something.

94
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:43,780
People are waiting in the line.

95
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:54,925
Fuck!

96
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:00,462
Who's that?
Another runaway?

97
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:04,127
Gonna come back.
That bitch's an orphan.

98
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:08,402
They should leave orphanage around 18.

99
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:09,932
Where would he go?

100
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:23,280
Whew... So hot.
How did it go?

101
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:25,619
Why?
Not good?

102
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:32,057
How many times?

103
00:15:37,803 --> 00:15:39,464
Sleeping here again tonight?

104
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:44,838
You are obstinacy itself.

105
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:49,680
How much can you earn washing dishes?

106
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:57,648
Here...
Chicken soup.

107
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:00,454
A little later.

108
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,388
You should've hung onto the factory.

109
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,223
You're not even going to academy lately.

110
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:09,825
Have to work at night.

111
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:18,368
You just ain't good at dishwashing.

112
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,808
Did he say I could work till the weekend?

113
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:30,014
I apologize. I'll take care of it right away.

114
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:46,762
It's you who washed this?

115
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:49,131
Stain remains!

116
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:52,939
Would you eat from this dirty plate?

117
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:57,872
Use your eyes when washing dishes.

118
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:04,378
Hwan-sun, come see me later.

119
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,064
Just damn shinny... Mysophobiacs...

120
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:23,167
Use eyes for dishwashing?
Do her eyes spout out detergent, huh?

121
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:36,641
Hello?

122
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:38,243
Oh, my dear son!

123
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:40,245
Did you?

124
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:44,515
Hold on a second.

125
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:50,153
Well, I don't hire fags.

126
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:53,157
Patrons here don't like fags, either.

127
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:59,932
I'm a fag.
And I despise ambiguity.

128
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:03,231
What side are you on?

129
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:12,476
Don't tell Hwan-sun.

130
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:30,827
Thank you.

131
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:32,827
I'll be right back.

132
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,886
Gays don't stand this long.

133
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:35,082
Some of them elope with customers.

134
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:38,389
We're here just to make money.

135
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:42,734
Damn it!

136
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:46,430
I never let them fuck my ass, though.

137
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:52,203
How did you enjoy giving first service?

138
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,238
Don't tell me you had an anal one.

139
00:21:57,783 --> 00:21:59,148
Why are you doing this?

140
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:00,713
Why?

141
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:09,185
My mother has cancer...
I am the only one that can work.

142
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:10,656
Really?

143
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:15,290
Moron! Do you believe that?

144
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:18,635
A hundred years since my mom died.

145
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:26,739
Heard you're from a home for orphans.
I am from a home for juvenile delinquent.

146
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,988
A call from Madame.
Patrons are waiting for us. Let's go.

147
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:45,759
I'll find some stupid damn homo bastard
and suck to the last drop of his blood.

148
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:51,164
I'll buy a sports car and fancy stuffs.

149
00:22:53,605 --> 00:22:56,096
My prostitution is all for my sweetheart.

150
00:22:57,676 --> 00:22:58,976
What about you?

151
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,110
No girlfriend.

152
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,238
Not that... Why are you doing this?

153
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:07,918
For money.

154
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:12,483
Yes money.

155
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:19,758
I'll suck yours if you pay.

156
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,796
Let's go making money...

157
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,480
Bottoms up! Bottoms up! Bottoms up!

158
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:50,187
My father got a traffic accident.

159
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:54,226
Second round, right?

160
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:00,527
I think I'm falling in love with you.

161
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:04,739
You can always come see me at the bar.

162
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:58,125
Hear me out.
Why are you so mad at me?

163
00:24:58,396 --> 00:25:01,388
I told him to go...
But he came himself.

164
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:10,365
Filthy bastard!
Did I tell you to do this?

165
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:12,008
Is it why you came to Seoul?

166
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,841
Fucking orphans!

167
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,579
Chain of idiots!

168
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:28,154
Asshole!
I changed your diapers,

169
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:32,524
and I even stole for you
when you got sick.

170
00:25:32,597 --> 00:25:34,030
And this is what I get? You jerk.

171
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:48,368
I'm already firm...

172
00:25:49,514 --> 00:25:51,243
Very dogged...

173
00:25:54,686 --> 00:26:00,056
I'll be filthy rich
and go to college.

174
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:06,788
I'm gonna be like him, Mr. god's gift.

175
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:15,205
Just give me a second.
Let me linger just for a moment.

176
00:26:18,176 --> 00:26:19,404
Just a second.

177
00:26:28,386 --> 00:26:30,217
Fuck! Damn it!

178
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,763
That would be enough.

179
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:42,166
Fuck! Those bastards deserve it.

180
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:44,869
Strip me naked without paying?

181
00:26:44,904 --> 00:26:49,932
Fuck! Gonna bury the sons of bitches.

182
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:51,642
What's the matter?

183
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:55,739
Dirty pigs! They wanted threesome.
Would you do that shit?

184
00:26:56,848 --> 00:26:58,717
Why not? Why didn't you?

185
00:26:58,752 --> 00:27:01,811
Moron! Nobody will invite you anyway.

186
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:04,914
Fuck!

187
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:07,225
What if he finds out?

188
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,560
I don't give a shit.

189
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:13,227
Gonna buy some present for Sun-mi.
It's her birthday next week.

190
00:27:13,331 --> 00:27:15,822
Hey, hey! Patrons are here.
Get ready!

191
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:20,769
Jae-woo, your ass is biting the pants.
Spew, bitch! Hurry up!

192
00:27:20,872 --> 00:27:21,964
How's he? Another jerking prick?

193
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:26,168
How come I know without one fuck?
You should try.

194
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:28,743
Suit was nice, though.

195
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:30,741
Hey Hey, Quickly!

196
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:35,987
You bitches all did the ass thing today?
Now, here go the players. #3, Su-min.

197
00:27:36,022 --> 00:27:37,956
Fuck it. #3 is for me.

198
00:27:37,991 --> 00:27:38,854
Screw you, bitch.

199
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,897
Jesus, what's eating Madame, today?

200
00:27:45,932 --> 00:27:47,455
Must be in the period.

201
00:27:47,732 --> 00:27:49,934
His ex made a scene here yesterday.

202
00:27:49,969 --> 00:27:52,402
And called by the court for his son.

203
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:55,367
Being gay and parent is old-fashioned.

204
00:27:56,107 --> 00:27:59,270
Wait! #1's for me.

205
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:01,769
Hey, betting's on. 20,000 won.

206
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:12,489
Hello. Hyun-min, #1.

207
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:15,458
Hi. I am Jung-tae, #2.

208
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:18,126
Su-min, #3.

209
00:28:18,897 --> 00:28:20,194
Kang, #4.

210
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:24,934
How do you find them, sir?
You're lucky for this high selection.

211
00:28:25,904 --> 00:28:27,565
Which number are you gonna choose, sir?

212
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:34,671
Or do you want to take a look at others?

213
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:36,508
No.

214
00:28:44,522 --> 00:28:45,580
What's gotten into his head?

215
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:47,024
Hey!

216
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:54,298
Hey, look!

217
00:28:55,433 --> 00:28:56,957
Are you insane?

218
00:28:58,036 --> 00:29:00,129
Are you gonna spoil my business?

219
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:07,075
Damn insolent bitch!

220
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:09,906
Think I'm gonna hit the ceiling.

221
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:24,123
I'll be waiting outside.

222
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:14,003
No backside.

223
00:30:17,448 --> 00:30:18,881
Does it erect?

224
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:58,019
Wish your thing was a gun.

225
00:31:05,897 --> 00:31:09,799
Wish I could pull the trigger inside me.

226
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:09,658
You are disgusting.
Have been disgusting from the beginning.

227
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:13,687
If you come see me again, I'll kill you.

228
00:32:19,904 --> 00:32:20,928
Don't sell?

229
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:11,309
Hmm... It goes very well with you.

230
00:35:11,344 --> 00:35:12,640
- Thank you.
- Gorgeous...

231
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,708
It'd let you look taller than Jae-min?

232
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:49,304
Excuse me...

233
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:54,077
Are you happen to...
be a player?

234
00:37:00,284 --> 00:37:02,252
Here, try this on.

235
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:06,154
Give me back later.

236
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:07,947
Thank you.

237
00:37:08,593 --> 00:37:10,390
Boy, where are you staying?

238
00:37:11,295 --> 00:37:13,092
In the sauna, for the time being.

239
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:18,168
Phew... Your coarse look screams that
you should end up living in the sauna.

240
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:23,133
Jesus, Madame got so rusty these days.

241
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:28,168
You can crash at my place for a while.

242
00:37:28,846 --> 00:37:30,473
Really?

243
00:37:32,116 --> 00:37:33,276
Just for a few days.

244
00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:35,643
Thank you so much.

245
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:42,056
How touching!
Yes, you orphans should help each other.

246
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:47,991
You bitches never know what to suck.
Stop sucking that, bitches!

247
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:53,271
Patron! Mr. Kim is here.
Be in a hurry. You check your pants.

248
00:37:53,306 --> 00:37:54,499
Gee... Su-min, again?

249
00:37:54,872 --> 00:37:58,933
Then this?
Are you a dig on Shilim avenue?

250
00:37:59,243 --> 00:38:01,006
Take off the glasses and get dressed.

251
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:05,444
What's this? What?
A cow? A dog?

252
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:07,710
Hey, leave it alone.

253
00:38:07,818 --> 00:38:08,386
Now, hurry up!

254
00:38:08,421 --> 00:38:09,421
Yes, ma'am.

255
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:13,785
Do I look like the dick on Shilim avenue?

256
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:16,786
Fucking moron! What a variety show!

257
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:29,104
Hand that to me.

258
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:30,872
Oh, no thanks.

259
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:32,072
Hand me.

260
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:33,974
Thank you.

261
00:38:34,845 --> 00:38:35,845
Let's go.

262
00:38:38,082 --> 00:38:39,811
Where you're going over these patrons?

263
00:38:40,584 --> 00:38:43,521
Fuck it! Beer customers are patrons?

264
00:38:43,556 --> 00:38:44,044
Hey!

265
00:38:44,555 --> 00:38:45,283
What for?

266
00:38:46,023 --> 00:38:47,854
It's my girlfriend's birthday.

267
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:52,294
OK, you are the boss, you whore bitch!

268
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:04,408
I love the city lights of Seoul.

269
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:07,337
Gonna go to every place some day later.

270
00:39:10,381 --> 00:39:14,875
I want to set Seoul on fire.

271
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:19,183
Why?
It's so fabulous, isn't it?

272
00:39:21,826 --> 00:39:25,193
In Seoul...
You are not to trust anybody.

273
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:26,753
Why not?

274
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:32,329
Why did you come to Seoul?

275
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:38,175
To make money.
Nothing to do in the countryside.

276
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:40,143
'Cause people like us have nothing.

277
00:39:42,646 --> 00:39:46,605
By the way, why are you so kind to me?

278
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:51,418
You remind me of someone...

279
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:53,716
Who?

280
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:05,229
Su-min, let's get something to eat.

281
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,231
It'll be on me
'cause I owe you one.

282
00:40:16,547 --> 00:40:21,246
Sausages over fishcake soup!
Yummy!

283
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:07,262
Harsh bastard.
Haven't heard from you for ages.

284
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:13,461
Hwan-sun gave you a call, right?
He makes fuss over nothing.

285
00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:19,640
I hurt a bit.
But will be leaving hospital quite soon.

286
00:41:20,744 --> 00:41:24,077
Phew... How can you play golf
with that broken shoulder?

287
00:41:24,882 --> 00:41:26,679
Holy shit! Can't even jerk off.

288
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,647
Gee, I prefer type B for this drink.

289
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:36,554
You look so dandy without brace.

290
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:41,055
Is that so?
I am handsome, I know.

291
00:41:41,932 --> 00:41:42,899
You look good.

292
00:41:46,203 --> 00:41:49,832
What are you up to these days?
Even Hwan-sun doesn't let me know.

293
00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:56,603
Appearance's got nice, though.
Ah, Did he visit you?

294
00:41:57,581 --> 00:41:58,138
Who?

295
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:01,849
You know, the high-handed personnel.
The day you got fired...

296
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:03,452
And?

297
00:42:04,288 --> 00:42:07,985
He kept asking me where you were.

298
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:10,123
So I told him you went to Hwan-sun's.

299
00:42:10,995 --> 00:42:15,523
He said he had to apologize to you.

300
00:42:18,769 --> 00:42:24,036
I heard he made a fuss at Hwan-sun's.
To find out where you were.

301
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:28,145
Searched everywhere to track you down.

302
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:31,080
A real freak...
with wheat-floured face.

303
00:42:31,482 --> 00:42:33,109
He think he's a detective or something?

304
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:40,452
You have something to solve with him?
Did he come to you eventually?

305
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:47,057
Look, Remember the bitch
who got the doggy balloon from him?

306
00:43:47,725 --> 00:43:49,920
She ran away with his credit cards.

307
00:43:51,395 --> 00:43:53,556
He even stood surety for the bitch.

308
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:56,724
What should he do now?

309
00:43:57,835 --> 00:44:02,363
If somebody asks you to lend money
You just say NO.

310
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:05,032
It can destroy one and all.

311
00:44:49,753 --> 00:44:50,685
Hey...

312
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:59,657
Su-min, I am doomed.

313
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,268
I got nothing.

314
00:45:10,507 --> 00:45:16,002
Lend me some money
just for a grenade.

315
00:45:21,618 --> 00:45:23,017
Welcome! Welcome!

316
00:46:55,112 --> 00:46:55,703
Let go!

317
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:58,637
Excuse me, sir. What's the matter?

318
00:47:01,752 --> 00:47:04,016
Why? Today it's 10 million won?

319
00:47:05,589 --> 00:47:06,817
Am I a sugar daddy to you?

320
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:12,118
Fucker! Yes, I'm crazy about money.
You know what it is like?

321
00:47:14,264 --> 00:47:15,561
I warned you not to come again, didn't I?

322
00:47:19,102 --> 00:47:23,402
Once... Just once. Can't you see me
as a man instead of money?

323
00:47:34,985 --> 00:47:36,475
Why are you dangling after me?

324
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:42,283
We didn't introduce each other, yet.

325
00:47:56,406 --> 00:48:02,470
I am in pain since I met you.

326
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:07,912
Why?
Because you fell for a prostitute?

327
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:13,015
Because you are a gay?

328
00:48:21,431 --> 00:48:23,228
Why keep ignoring my heart?

329
00:48:25,302 --> 00:48:26,826
So corny.

330
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:33,240
You're rich and well-educated.

331
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:37,337
Can't you find something brilliant to say?

332
00:48:50,694 --> 00:48:51,251
Let go.

333
00:48:56,633 --> 00:48:58,328
I can't figure it out,

334
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:04,266
but I just like you.

335
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:16,900
You don't even know my name yet.

336
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:25,380
Sorry to interrupt you but
don't call me anymore.

337
00:49:37,530 --> 00:49:40,220
This is the last free service, my patron.

338
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:44,430
I will not accept you for countless money.

339
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:50,700
You can run and hide anytime you want
but I can't afford to have fun with you.

340
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:53,040
Forget about me.

341
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:01,770
Nice to meet you, Su-min.

342
00:51:21,930 --> 00:51:25,890
That Police Commissioner General
he's completely fallen in me, I guess.

343
00:51:27,270 --> 00:51:29,600
Said he's gonna buy me a car last night.

344
00:51:31,370 --> 00:51:31,840
Yeah?

345
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:34,800
Yes, I've really been eager for a car.

346
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:38,180
I'll drive to every corner in Seoul.

347
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,840
Let's go on a trip for several days.

348
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:47,950
Boy, Save up some.
You only waste.

349
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:50,960
Can you pay your college that way?

350
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:54,550
College?
Our Father at the orphanage told me

351
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:58,100
that I could never go to college
though I eat up a hundred encyclopedias.

352
00:52:00,570 --> 00:52:08,840
Well... Su-min... Don't you feel anything
when you... do that with a guy?

353
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:11,040
What about it?

354
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:15,240
Think I've got somebody in my mind.

355
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:23,020
I heard nothing.

356
00:52:26,130 --> 00:52:27,820
Madame dislikes that, boy.

357
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:30,820
Then you can't go on with this.

358
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:34,700
What about you?
The rumor's all around. With him...

359
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:38,130
Who is he, indeed?

360
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,410
Cut the crap!

361
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:49,310
Phew... Must be in real love, huh?

362
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,180
You also wanna go? Go.

363
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,090
Oh
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

364
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:03,690
I'm very sorry.

365
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:05,770
Hey, you lax bitches.

366
00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:07,390
Can't you be more punctual?

367
00:53:07,770 --> 00:53:10,360
Come on, Hand me that.
Hand me, I'll take care of it.

368
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:14,040
Don't try to butter me up.
Next time you're late,

369
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:18,340
Oh, Su-min!

370
00:53:20,110 --> 00:53:20,510
Yes.

371
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:21,370
Come here.

372
00:53:25,190 --> 00:53:25,620
What?

373
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,510
Your stalker has been here.

374
00:53:30,390 --> 00:53:31,790
Came in right upon opening.

375
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:33,450
A tough bitch!

376
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:37,330
I did as you told me.

377
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:41,590
I told him you left Seoul
and he just left this to me.

378
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:47,370
Are you messing around with him?

379
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,830
Behave yourself!

380
00:53:56,450 --> 00:54:01,250
Jae-min Song, is he rich?

381
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:04,690
Seemed to be good for botting.

382
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:12,430
Get real, you sucker!

383
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:48,000
My sister got us air tickets to Europe.

384
00:54:52,670 --> 00:54:53,700
Prague is included.

385
00:54:57,850 --> 00:54:59,540
You also wanted go there, didn't you?

386
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,310
So, did you choose one?

387
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:13,380
Oh, I like this.

388
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:17,020
Reasonable price as well.

389
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:18,300
How beautiful!

390
00:55:21,470 --> 00:55:23,870
But isn't it too expensive?

391
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:25,040
Not at all.

392
00:55:25,370 --> 00:55:27,030
He's my only son.

393
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:29,270
Oh, his father would do more.

394
00:55:30,010 --> 00:55:33,240
Though he's strict, he cherishes his son.

395
00:55:35,050 --> 00:55:37,710
Hey Jae-min, How do you like this?

396
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:43,760
Take some glittering one.

397
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:46,160
I'm going back to office.

398
00:55:49,630 --> 00:55:50,490
Did you have a fight?

399
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:54,830
Send him, please.

400
00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:46,190
From X-Large...

401
00:56:58,730 --> 00:56:59,760
Shall I strip off?

402
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:03,130
No...

403
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:17,880
Once there was a timid man
who fell in love with a poor man.

404
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:30,320
But the poor man wouldn't take his heart.

405
00:57:38,010 --> 00:57:39,300
What am I supposed to do?

406
00:57:47,850 --> 00:57:48,680
Give it up.

407
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:00,360
What about this?

408
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,370
Found something brilliant to say?

409
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:12,500
Yeah.

410
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:21,640
Why should be your penis special
of all the penises I suck every night?

411
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:27,910
'Cause mine is sole...

412
00:58:31,590 --> 00:58:32,750
Yours is also sole.

413
00:59:12,030 --> 00:59:13,000
Su-min!

414
00:59:14,270 --> 00:59:15,260
Su-min!

415
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:18,330
Su-min LEE!

416
00:59:19,910 --> 00:59:20,570
Su-min LEE!

417
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:22,740
Su-min!

418
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:27,140
Where's Su-min? Su-min! Su-min!

419
00:59:27,850 --> 00:59:28,980
What's the matter, sir?

420
00:59:29,020 --> 00:59:30,180
Sir, what's wrong with you?

421
00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:30,810
Let go!

422
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:32,410
Hey!
Get him! Get him!

423
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:33,920
Who the fuck are you, asshole?

424
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:34,720
None of your business.

425
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:37,550
Come! Back up!

426
00:59:38,430 --> 00:59:39,650
You crazy bastard!

427
00:59:43,430 --> 00:59:45,460
Let go!
Let go of me, you fuckers!

428
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:46,860
Su-min!

429
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:49,300
Su-min!

430
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:51,670
Oh my! Oh my!

431
00:59:55,580 --> 00:59:56,410
Su-min!

432
00:59:56,510 --> 00:59:59,210
What are you doing outside?
Come, you fucker.

433
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:05,540
Oh no! What's wrong with him?
Hey! Help us, bitch!

434
01:00:06,750 --> 01:00:08,820
This motherfucker makes my head open.

435
01:00:08,860 --> 01:00:09,810
What the hell is this?

436
01:00:11,060 --> 01:00:11,990
Let go of him.

437
01:00:13,890 --> 01:00:14,990
Fuck you!

438
01:00:15,630 --> 01:00:16,290
Let go!

439
01:00:31,510 --> 01:00:32,480
Get up.

440
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:38,820
You damn jackass, get up.

441
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:43,950
Get up!

442
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:22,920
Sorry...

443
01:03:28,390 --> 01:03:29,580
Is it your first time doing the bottom?

444
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:34,150
Disgusting.

445
01:03:34,830 --> 01:03:35,730
You look strait-laced.

446
01:03:36,860 --> 01:03:41,630
I know.
Thank you.

447
01:03:43,470 --> 01:03:44,990
That's disgusting, too.

448
01:03:47,510 --> 01:03:48,060
You're right.

449
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:54,180
Did you find me disgusting at first?

450
01:03:55,950 --> 01:03:56,750
Yeah.

451
01:03:58,320 --> 01:03:59,320
You're right.

452
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:04,250
Now I think I can get it.

453
01:04:06,290 --> 01:04:06,820
Get what?

454
01:04:07,660 --> 01:04:09,420
That I am really disgusting.

455
01:04:12,100 --> 01:04:12,570
Right.

456
01:04:17,740 --> 01:04:18,860
I'm not going to office tomorrow.

457
01:05:39,490 --> 01:05:40,780
Thank you, Su-min.

458
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:14,650
Just a small sum.

459
01:06:22,860 --> 01:06:23,730
See you later.

460
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:25,530
OK, Take care and drop in again.

461
01:06:26,270 --> 01:06:26,930
Keep in touch.

462
01:06:33,070 --> 01:06:33,970
I'll drop in often.

463
01:06:34,010 --> 01:06:35,840
Drop in where, you foxy bitch?

464
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:41,280
Thank you so much for everything...

465
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:45,180
Bye...

466
01:06:48,990 --> 01:06:51,480
I'll come to see you, OK?

467
01:06:57,460 --> 01:06:58,950
That bitch's getting hitched at last.

468
01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:03,830
Even I couldn't make it yet.
Give me one service before you go, bitch!

469
01:07:24,590 --> 01:07:26,350
I don't kiss clients, sir.

470
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:29,550
What about the backside?

471
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:34,460
'Cause I fancy you, sir.
I'll offer it on the installment plan.

472
01:07:37,970 --> 01:07:39,400
I have to earn a lot of money, then.

473
01:07:41,010 --> 01:07:42,630
Aren't you working too hard?

474
01:07:43,210 --> 01:07:46,840
I think so.
Surfed the net all day long.

475
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:51,510
To travel in Europe with you.
Let's go to Prague.

476
01:08:55,050 --> 01:08:57,180
Stop that. Stop that...
Just for a moment.

477
01:08:57,220 --> 01:08:59,740
- I might be late. Seriously... late...
- Come on.

478
01:09:15,340 --> 01:09:16,170
Wait outside.

479
01:09:17,470 --> 01:09:18,840
- Jae-min.
- Wait outside!

480
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:45,820
It won't work. Too old.

481
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:49,360
How have you...
possibly been doing without a TV?

482
01:09:53,670 --> 01:09:54,500
Is it OK?

483
01:09:55,110 --> 01:09:59,670
What?
Oh, my mom?

484
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:05,540
She has known that I'm a gay for years.

485
01:10:11,260 --> 01:10:15,920
Having no parents is good in this point.

486
01:10:20,570 --> 01:10:22,760
When I'm with you, I get solid.

487
01:10:48,390 --> 01:10:49,050
Yes...

488
01:10:53,470 --> 01:10:54,520
Nice car...

489
01:10:55,970 --> 01:10:56,730
I envy you.

490
01:10:58,770 --> 01:11:00,170
I took one week off.

491
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:04,280
I'll drive around whole Seoul.

492
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:08,770
I wanted to go on a trip with you.

493
01:11:12,150 --> 01:11:13,590
He's up there, right?

494
01:11:16,690 --> 01:11:17,620
You look happy. I envy you.

495
01:11:21,030 --> 01:11:23,120
The one I care for...

496
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:25,390
He...

497
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:28,790
He lives in a small room on top.

498
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:37,930
I also hope I could make you happy.

499
01:12:45,580 --> 01:12:49,780
I also will think of you every morning
when my thing erects.

500
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:12,540
Congratulations.

501
01:13:16,010 --> 01:13:18,030
Hey, Mr. Song. Congratulate you.

502
01:13:19,250 --> 01:13:19,710
Yeah...

503
01:13:20,580 --> 01:13:21,550
Good morning.

504
01:13:21,580 --> 01:13:22,410
Congratulations, Jae-min.

505
01:13:39,700 --> 01:13:40,460
What's this?

506
01:13:42,170 --> 01:13:46,230
I'm not so ignorant
as not to understand sexuality.

507
01:13:48,070 --> 01:13:50,770
I don't care if you screw a guy or not.

508
01:13:54,050 --> 01:13:55,810
You don't get him pregnant anyhow.

509
01:14:00,250 --> 01:14:01,980
But, marry her.

510
01:14:05,790 --> 01:14:07,120
Why do you have to do this?

511
01:14:07,390 --> 01:14:09,550
I have to leave for the class soon.
Let's bring it to a conclusion.

512
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:14,890
Go to your father's office.
He knows, too.

513
01:14:16,470 --> 01:14:20,500
Not only your father.
I'm gonna tell everybody.

514
01:14:20,940 --> 01:14:22,970
I'm gonna make it my way at any cost.

515
01:15:14,530 --> 01:15:15,020
Father.

516
01:16:23,300 --> 01:16:25,130
Jae-min's not in right now...

517
01:16:26,170 --> 01:16:27,190
Who are you?

518
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:30,290
Who are you?

519
01:16:32,810 --> 01:16:33,830
Me?

520
01:17:51,180 --> 01:17:52,170
It hurts.

521
01:18:06,230 --> 01:18:09,500
Yes...
I played foul, right?

522
01:18:13,810 --> 01:18:14,640
Disgusting.

523
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:18,200
Yeah,

524
01:18:21,380 --> 01:18:23,870
I've been disgusting from the beginning.

525
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:38,990
But...

526
01:18:40,930 --> 01:18:42,370
But I love you.

527
01:18:56,350 --> 01:18:58,870
Then, what's our relationship?

528
01:19:07,990 --> 01:19:09,260
'Cause I'm uneducated?

529
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:14,960
I'll study hard.

530
01:19:21,140 --> 01:19:22,610
Is it because I'm dirty?

531
01:19:25,910 --> 01:19:27,470
I'll stand faithful only to you.

532
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:33,450
Is it because I'm poor?

533
01:19:37,260 --> 01:19:38,920
I'll work hard.

534
01:19:56,510 --> 01:19:57,810
What is us?

535
01:20:07,220 --> 01:20:08,350
What am I to you?

536
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:19,010
Jae-min, Please don't hang up.

537
01:22:21,890 --> 01:22:22,950
Just a second will do.

538
01:22:28,460 --> 01:22:31,430
I'll wait here until you come down.

539
01:22:52,690 --> 01:22:53,670
Hello?

540
01:23:00,130 --> 01:23:00,680
Yes.

541
01:23:48,070 --> 01:23:51,740
Fuck!
This orphan has no mourner indeed.

542
01:23:53,010 --> 01:23:53,710
Back to Seoul.

543
01:23:58,350 --> 01:24:00,780
Fuck...
God damn it.

544
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:53,030
That son of a bitch!
Do drive, you fucker!

545
01:24:58,780 --> 01:25:00,440
Stop crying!

546
01:25:47,690 --> 01:25:51,060
Assholes. Everything's fucking illegal.

547
01:25:52,460 --> 01:25:54,860
Where to spread, then?

548
01:25:57,670 --> 01:26:01,260
The guy who bought Ga-ram a car was...
a policeman, right?

549
01:26:05,610 --> 01:26:07,770
Fuckers! Oughta sweep them away.

550
01:26:11,380 --> 01:26:15,380
I want to work there again.

551
01:26:17,290 --> 01:26:19,780
Why come back, sucker?

552
01:26:21,130 --> 01:26:21,890
Why?

553
01:26:26,530 --> 01:26:28,020
Fucking bloodsuckers...

554
01:26:29,130 --> 01:26:32,870
Gave him body and soul, you fool.

555
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:37,170
Fuck!
What a fucking old-fashioned love story!

556
01:26:38,510 --> 01:26:44,140
Look, The bastard will come back to you
with potbelly look long after marriage.

557
01:26:44,750 --> 01:26:46,080
Don't say like that.

558
01:26:47,590 --> 01:26:49,080
Screw you, fucker!

559
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:53,150
Don't you see what happened to Ga-ram?

560
01:26:53,990 --> 01:26:57,160
And what about me?
Don't you see this?

561
01:27:01,870 --> 01:27:07,100
Those loan sharks drive me crazy. Fuck!

562
01:27:09,070 --> 01:27:12,940
I would have beaten him to death
and screwed big money out of him.

563
01:27:13,550 --> 01:27:15,910
He is no different from the bitch
who ran away with all the money I had.

564
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:20,010
Fuck! If you say yes, I'll...

565
01:27:20,390 --> 01:27:21,390
You'll what?

566
01:27:22,220 --> 01:27:24,690
Don't you know
what should be done to vampires?

567
01:27:26,060 --> 01:27:27,150
You and me, we can...

568
01:27:27,390 --> 01:27:28,290
Let me get off here.

569
01:27:29,130 --> 01:27:30,260
If you just say you want to...

570
01:27:30,300 --> 01:27:31,420
Pull over!

571
01:27:34,330 --> 01:27:35,600
Shit!

572
01:28:03,530 --> 01:28:04,150
Ga-ram,

573
01:28:06,770 --> 01:28:09,260
Why am I heading for his place on?

574
01:28:17,610 --> 01:28:18,410
Ga-ram,

575
01:28:21,580 --> 01:28:25,540
He must have had no other choice, right?

576
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:37,430
But in Seoul...
we're not to trust anyone.

577
01:29:35,420 --> 01:29:36,850
Gotta make my way.

578
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:29,370
Make sure wedding invitations sent out
and the officiator and our in-laws.

579
01:30:29,570 --> 01:30:32,870
No need to mind that, OK?

580
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:38,980
Did you think about the car thing?

581
01:30:45,690 --> 01:30:46,690
Jae-min.

582
01:30:50,230 --> 01:30:50,990
Jae-min!

583
01:31:21,590 --> 01:31:24,390
By the way
the leader of Republican party is coming?

584
01:31:24,500 --> 01:31:28,260
It's only fair for him to come.
How much have I given him, huh?

585
01:31:28,700 --> 01:31:30,830
Ah, I should've heard it earlier.
I could have asked him for officiation.

586
01:31:41,980 --> 01:31:42,570
I'm sorry...

587
01:31:46,250 --> 01:31:47,810
The man we've just passed by,

588
01:31:47,950 --> 01:31:48,980
Jae-min!

589
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:54,390
He is the one I love.

590
01:32:03,640 --> 01:32:04,470
Sorry.

591
01:32:17,250 --> 01:32:22,650
Don't you live like that selfish.

592
01:32:41,270 --> 01:32:41,900
Thanks.

593
01:32:55,490 --> 01:32:57,680
Su-min!
Su-min!

594
01:33:32,890 --> 01:33:36,020
It's me.

595
01:33:38,160 --> 01:33:39,650
Manager, I can't go to office, tomorrow.

596
01:34:21,540 --> 01:34:22,540
...Su-min?

597
01:34:25,910 --> 01:34:26,970
...Su-min?

598
01:34:33,490 --> 01:34:35,650
<i>That was part one.</i>

599
01:34:35,720 --> 01:34:37,880
<i>I hope it was not too boring.</i>

600
01:34:38,290 --> 01:34:44,160
<i>Inside the studio is quite warm.</i>
<i>But looks like it's too windy outside.</i>

601
01:34:44,500 --> 01:34:47,620
<i>The first snow of the season is expected.</i>

602
01:34:47,730 --> 01:34:50,500
<i>Wrap up warm if you're going out.</i>

603
01:34:51,140 --> 01:34:54,300
<i>Now comes the 2nd part with new songs.</i>

604
01:35:56,800 --> 01:36:01,030
Stay firm.
We are on, at any rate.

605
01:36:02,310 --> 01:36:04,240
The bastards won't be hit and stand still.

606
01:36:05,340 --> 01:36:07,830
If they call the police, it's all over.

607
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:13,250
You can't suck their dicks forever.

608
01:36:17,090 --> 01:36:18,650
It was you who wanted to do this.

609
01:36:22,090 --> 01:36:24,250
Shut up, bastard! Fuck!

610
01:36:25,730 --> 01:36:26,990
Damn fucking pain in the ass!

611
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:38,870
Stop quacking, you fucker!

612
01:36:49,220 --> 01:36:52,550
Wow, It really is something to see.
Worth seeing.

613
01:36:53,960 --> 01:36:55,590
Stay aside, you fucker.

614
01:36:59,900 --> 01:37:03,460
Sir, have you enjoyed enough so far?

615
01:37:04,170 --> 01:37:06,160
It's time for mountain-climb training, sir.

616
01:37:06,940 --> 01:37:09,100
Get out, you fucker!

617
01:37:22,250 --> 01:37:24,380
What are you looking at, bastard?

618
01:38:09,300 --> 01:38:12,330
Hallelujah!
What a luxurious show it is!

619
01:38:13,200 --> 01:38:15,330
You despicable prick!

620
01:38:16,410 --> 01:38:18,970
Fucking stupid mutt!

621
01:38:19,140 --> 01:38:19,970
That's enough!

622
01:39:16,170 --> 01:39:17,430
What a big galoot!

623
01:39:17,570 --> 01:39:20,160
Sure he's not done military service
owing to his filthy rich father.

624
01:39:21,470 --> 01:39:24,670
Look at him. Look at him creeping.

625
01:39:29,080 --> 01:39:34,480
Honey, come on here.
Heaven's waiting for you.

626
01:39:35,650 --> 01:39:37,810
Fuck! Come quickly!

627
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:49,530
Come this way, you mother fucker!

628
01:39:54,910 --> 01:39:57,500
Want a cigarette before you die?

629
01:39:59,410 --> 01:40:01,570
Oops, No, Better not.
Smoking harms your health.

630
01:40:09,550 --> 01:40:13,510
Money doesn't grow on trees, you know.

631
01:40:14,360 --> 01:40:16,620
It grows on the dead man underground.

632
01:40:19,460 --> 01:40:25,990
If you meet the fucking God there,
give him my regards that he sucks.

633
01:40:28,410 --> 01:40:35,610
No, that I fucking thank him, OK?

634
01:40:37,080 --> 01:40:38,110
Amen!

635
01:40:39,620 --> 01:40:43,380
This tall bastard needs a deeper pit.

636
01:40:47,830 --> 01:40:51,120
If I didn't have pain in the back
you must have been dead already.

637
01:40:57,870 --> 01:40:58,730
Stop that.

638
01:41:04,810 --> 01:41:05,870
It's almost done.
I said, stop that!

639
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:10,240
Hey, Are you crazy?

640
01:41:11,980 --> 01:41:12,780
Fuck you! What's wrong?

641
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:15,150
Just stop that. I can't do this.

642
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:17,950
Take all the money with you.

643
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:21,990
Fuck! Get wise, sucker!

644
01:41:22,490 --> 01:41:23,080
Hell with fucking faggot sentiment.

645
01:41:23,190 --> 01:41:24,800
You fucker.

646
01:41:24,830 --> 01:41:25,920
Aw, You mother fucker,

647
01:41:57,560 --> 01:42:01,660
Fuck! Just take that money!

648
01:42:03,970 --> 01:42:04,630
I don't want it.

649
01:42:05,670 --> 01:42:07,070
I didn't do this for money.

650
01:42:08,840 --> 01:42:10,240
He's not gonna call the police.

651
01:42:12,510 --> 01:42:13,170
Just go.

652
01:42:43,510 --> 01:42:49,110
Aw, you fucker... What a sight!

653
01:42:49,580 --> 01:42:57,280
Yeah, If you love him so much
I'll bury you together with him.

654
01:43:01,360 --> 01:43:07,920
Fuck! Why should we be this miserable?

655
01:48:25,280 --> 01:48:26,180
Sorry.

656
01:48:39,830 --> 01:48:42,560
Nice to meet you, Jae-min.
