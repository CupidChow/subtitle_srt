1
00:00:12,303 --> 00:00:14,313
Is Yi Fu here?

2
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:19,352
Yes, he's in the restroom.

3
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:21,688
Have a seat. I'll get your favorite drink.

4
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:23,489
Take a seat.

5
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:43,801
It's his birthday today.

6
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:46,588
Yes.

7
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:48,973
He's celebrating his birthday
with his friends over there.

8
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:52,135
He even made a birthday wish for me just now.

9
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:54,637
He wished that I'd stay single forever.

10
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:55,972
What?

11
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:57,773
I was dumbfounded.

12
00:01:39,838 --> 00:01:43,654
[Episode 9: After the dust settles,
are we still in love?]

13
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,005
Table two, watch him.

14
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:13,024
I think he's drunk.

15
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,938
I'm sorry.

16
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:23,726
I'm sorry.

17
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:26,729
I was really busy at work today
and couldn't get away.

18
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:28,857
Why are you so drunk?

19
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:31,075
Let's go have spicy hotpot, okay?

20
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:35,663
- Let's go.
- Happy birthday, Yi Fu.

21
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,043
Let's go.

22
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,674
We're off. Bye.

23
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:16,631
What's on your mind?

24
00:03:16,631 --> 00:03:18,831
The fried dough sticks are getting soggy.

25
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,163
Nothing.

26
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:27,207
Are you still mad?

27
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:31,294
I didn't cook for you,
but brought you here for spicy hotpot.

28
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:34,013
No, spicy hotpot is good.

29
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,243
I'm going to the restroom first.

30
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,667
Someone was looking for you.

31
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,308
I had too much to drink earlier.

32
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,711
She forced me to take these photos.

33
00:05:09,711 --> 00:05:11,060
I have nothing to do with her.

34
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,895
I was wondering why
she was looking at me so strangely.

35
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:14,731
It turns out I was the one who got in the way.

36
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,149
I knew we wouldn't last three months.

37
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,692
She took these photos on purpose
and sent them to me.

38
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,527
Why would I like a girl like her?

39
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:22,955
Really? You looked so happy in the photos.

40
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:31,247
There's nothing going on between us.

41
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:33,541
Okay, I'm sorry.
I was in a bad mood and drank too much.

42
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,084
I promise it won't happen again.

43
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:37,462
I saw those messages and photos.

44
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,972
I just can't believe you.

45
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:42,224
Xin Tong.

46
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:48,230
What can I do to make you believe me?

47
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:50,732
Call her?

48
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,986
Okay, I'll call her now.

49
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:07,416
Do you believe me now?

50
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,371
There's nothing going on between us.

51
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,372
Besides, I'm in a terrible mood today.

52
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,632
I'm not in the mood for this nonsense.

53
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,678
Why would you be in a bad mood
on your birthday?

54
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,634
You were right.

55
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:27,644
I lost my stocks, my money, and my shop.

56
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:31,023
I have nothing now.

57
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:40,908
How did this happen?

58
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:45,363
I don't know why this happened.

59
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,623
I don't know what I should do.

60
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:59,085
Okay, I understand.

61
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,115
We'll face it together.

62
00:07:54,857 --> 00:07:55,266
[Six years ago]

63
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,268
Bitch!
[Six years ago]

64
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:57,768
Don't run!

65
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:59,312
Fucking trash!

66
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,231
Running? Just wait until I catch you!

67
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:03,999
Stop!

68
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,121
Are you okay?

69
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,604
Hey!

70
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,142
She ran that way.

71
00:08:56,827 --> 00:09:00,589
Gu Hou Ze Psychiatric Clinic.

72
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,429
I still need to clean your wound.

73
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,801
Your name is Gu Hou Ze?

74
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,928
- Yes.
- Is this your clinic?

75
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,291
Yes.

76
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:24,397
Why was that guy chasing you?

77
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,523
Do you owe him money?

78
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:28,033
He owes me money.

79
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:31,737
He wants to take advantage of me.

80
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:34,323
He didn't pay when he was done.

81
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:36,583
So, I just took the money and ran.

82
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:44,000
How can I work like this?

83
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,675
What do you do?

84
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:50,389
I'm a masseuse. Feels good, right?

85
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:54,059
Let me clean your hands, too.

86
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,938
How can I go to work like this?

87
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:04,520
It's all your fault.

88
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,988
Otherwise, I wouldn't have fallen.

89
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:10,117
Fine, I apologize.

90
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:15,247
Thank you, Dr. Gu.

91
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,093
Do you have an appointment?

92
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:32,651
I bought too many tangerines.

93
00:10:32,651 --> 00:10:33,716
Here, have some.

94
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,308
Thank you.

95
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:40,181
These are oranges, right?

96
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,223
Are they?

97
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:43,351
Yes.

98
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,061
But they look so similar.

99
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,937
They're all the same.

100
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:48,814
Come in and have a seat.

101
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,449
Sure.

102
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:04,455
I made too much.

103
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:06,624
I thought I'd pack you a lunchbox.

104
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:09,377
Why do you always either make too much food,

105
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:12,512
or buy too much fruit?

106
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:15,800
I'm just dumb.

107
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,135
I just thought...

108
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:19,679
I happened to cook too much.

109
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,474
Don't you think food tastes better when shared?

110
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:24,517
Yes.

111
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,435
- Where's yours?
- I'll eat at home.

112
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:29,237
Didn't you say it tastes better when shared?

113
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:31,721
Yes.

114
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,197
What's wrong?

115
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:41,158
Did you add sugar?

116
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:43,160
Did I?

117
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,496
I think so...

118
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:48,040
They look rather similar.

119
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,417
I know.

120
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,293
Just think of it as a southern flavor.

121
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:53,512
You'll get used to it.

122
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,292
Tell me if I need to adjust the pressure.

123
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,021
I think it's okay.

124
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:11,077
A little harder.

125
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,084
Like this?

126
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:15,719
Yes.

127
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:20,807
Aren't you curious
why I'm in this line of work?

128
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,060
Does it matter?

129
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:29,225
You must really like New Zealand.

130
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,276
How did you know?

131
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,401
When I'm massaging customers,

132
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:46,075
I always imagine myself
in New Zealand, looking at the sea,

133
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:50,496
kneading dough, baking pizza.

134
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,547
That would make me feel better.

135
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:58,887
So, now, you're treating me like dough.

You're even providing breakfast?

148
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,927
You slept for a long time.

149
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:48,937
You must be tired from work.

150
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,399
I haven't slept so deeply in a long time.

151
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:55,694
Maybe it's because your massage was amazing.

152
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:00,865
Why don't you sleep here from now on?

153
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:03,743
Okay.

155
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,917
Is it the sea?

00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,509
Yes.

Use your imagination.

00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:31,104
If I say it's the sea, then it's the sea.

161
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:09,927
I'm worried...

162
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:13,055
we can't hide the test results.

163
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,981
Give me a minute.

164
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,104
Here's the thing.

165
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:24,066
A doctor is obligated
to keep a patient's condition confidential.

166
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:28,237
If the information is leaked,
they'll have to take legal responsibility.

00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:31,532
You're his legal wife now.

Even if the baby isn't his,

169
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,545
you can still inherit his assets.

170
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:03,355
One, two, three, four.

171
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,107
Five, six, seven, eight.

172
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:07,526
Her condition has improved a lot
compared to when she first came here.

173
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,820
- Look.
- Five, six, seven, eight.

174
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:13,782
Two, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

175
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:16,136
Stretch out your hand. One, two, three, four.

176
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:17,911
Five, six, seven, eight.

177
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:20,427
One more time. One, two, three, four.

178
00:17:20,427 --> 00:17:22,833
Five, six. That's it.

179
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:26,344
Thank you. Please sit down.

180
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:29,631
Okay, don't put your back against the chair.

181
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:30,674
Step on it.

00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:33,260
Take three deep breaths
to adjust your breathing.

183
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,686
Inhale.

184
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:40,098
Has anyone else heard that audio file?

185
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,979
Why are you so nervous?

186
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:46,440
Relax.

187
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,358
What do you want?

188
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:50,743
You know what I want.

189
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:53,371
To leave this place.

190
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:57,959
I'm sorry, but I don't think
I'm capable of doing that.

191
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:03,624
You're prone to violence, self-harm,

192
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,709
and severe delusions.

193
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:06,877
Chief Zhu said

194
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:10,172
you must be hospitalized for proper treatment.

195
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:13,383
Don't think I don't know
you're fooling Chief Zhu.

196
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:18,263
You claim I have delusional jealousy.

197
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,932
You're the delusional one.

198
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,850
How could it be me?

199
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,735
Have you been sleeping well lately?

200
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:27,981
I just want you to face the truth.

201
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:29,775
That woman used your sperm

202
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,486
to scam the old man's inheritance.

203
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:35,948
You were foolishly used,
yet you thought it was true love.

204
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:39,618
Now that she's the chairman, what do you have?

205
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:43,038
She doesn't even dare
to announce your relationship with her.

206
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:47,425
The child's surname will still be Zhan, right?

207
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,879
Just so you know.

208
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:56,135
The estate trust has a 20-year restriction
on selling stocks and properties.

209
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,387
In order to help me pay off my debts,

210
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,931
she had to become the chairman.

211
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,057
Whose fault is that?

212
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:04,935
And you call yourself a famous psychiatrist.

213
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:08,355
How could you believe her nonsense?

214
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:10,566
Why would she give up her position?

215
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:13,652
There's no way she'd run away with you?

216
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:16,321
You're the delusional one.

217
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,247
Get it straight.

218
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:20,951
Let me remind you.

219
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:24,079
Antidepressants will make your mouth dry.

220
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,999
Remember to stay hydrated.

221
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,175
Let's call it a day.

222
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:31,170
It seems like

223
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,681
I can't leave this place for the time being.

224
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:40,220
If that's the case,
you can visit me every week.

225
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,314
This is Dr. Gu. We're done here, thanks.

226
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:47,819
If you don't, I'll send the audio file out.

227
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,360
After all, you're so sick.

228
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,162
I'm the only one who can save you.

229
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:06,713
Have you ever thought about
how we ended up like this?

230
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,304
You tell me.

231
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:18,842
We were so in love.

232
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:21,887
We even said we'd go to New Zealand together.

233
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,272
But you locked me up here.

234
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,150
Why are you looking at me like that?

235
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:29,694
Feeling sorry for me?

236
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,617
Give it to me.

237
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:55,921
Vice President.

238
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,798
I've been collecting more exposes online

239
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,133
on Zhou Xiao Qi for money and murder.

240
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:01,718
And the follow-up articles
in the weekly magazines.

241
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:03,549
I've sorted them all out.

242
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:08,058
Have you sent it to Old Chairman Wu?

243
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:10,519
I sent it by courier this morning.

244
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,361
This morning?

245
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:17,325
I really can't do without your help,
my little assistant.

246
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:20,161
Here, take a look.

247
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,265
Look.

248
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:31,832
This is very expensive.

249
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,458
When I went out with you last time,

250
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,127
I saw you staring at someone else.

251
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,169
Listen.

252
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:39,923
I can't stand it when my woman
is envious of others.

253
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:42,141
Why are you so nice to me?

254
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:48,056
Because it's your turn
to be nice to me tonight, alright?

255
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,028
Come in.

256
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:59,026
Xiao Qi.

257
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:03,030
I've received Chairman Qian's proposal
for the board meeting.

258
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,957
They want to dismiss you as the chairman.

259
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,411
They can dismiss me at the board meeting?

260
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:12,622
According to company law, they can.

261
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:14,249
For such an important proposal,

262
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:16,835
more than two-thirds of the directors
must be present.

263
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:19,713
It can only be approved by a majority vote.

264
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:21,757
So, there are nine seats in total.

265
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,550
If fewer than six directors attend,

266
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,385
their proposal won't pass.

267
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:26,470
That's right.

268
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,555
Who can we dissuade from attending?

269
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:30,140
Among the nine directors,

270
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:33,746
we have you, Director You, and me.

271
00:22:33,746 --> 00:22:35,486
It's a total of three seats.

272
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:37,397
If that's the case,

273
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:40,650
if we can get just one
of the remaining six to not attend,

274
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,778
they won't be able to dismiss you.

275
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:46,073
However, that one vote won't be easy.

276
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:47,616
Chairman Qian has two seats.

277
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,159
The union representative has one.

278
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:50,202
And General Manager Huang has one.

279
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,412
These four seats probably can't be swayed.

280
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:56,416
The remaining two seats
are Old Chairman Wu and Chairman Lin.

281
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:57,918
Who are they?

282
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:00,087
Old Chairman Wu was the first chairman.

283
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:02,339
More than 20 years ago, Hongfa was led by him,

284
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:06,218
Chairman Zhan, General Manager Xin,
and General Manager Huang.

285
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,637
You met Chairman Lin at your birthday party.

286
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:11,147
Chairman Lin Xi Ming of Chaomai.

287
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:20,948
Chairman Lin.

288
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,619
Thank you for taking the time to come.

289
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:37,340
I remember you like Oriental Beauty.

290
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:50,686
It smells good.

291
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,736
It's good tea.

292
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:04,784
I got this for you at Sotheby's last month.

293
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:18,214
You're too kind.

294
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:22,627
I'd like to ask you for a favor today.

295
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:23,795
Go ahead.

296
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:26,131
I hope you can continue to support me

297
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,391
as chairman of Hongfa.

298
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:33,221
Since you're so straightforward,

299
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:35,682
I'll get straight to the point.

300
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:38,185
When General Manager Xin asked me to invest,

301
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:42,147
it was to promote a strategic alliance
between Chaomai and Hongfa.

302
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:45,984
Who knew that after
Zhan Qian Ren became chairman,

303
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:48,361
he'd give me such a hard time.

304
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:50,538
It's giving me a headache.

305
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:58,538
Mr. Zhan wants you to be his successor.

306
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:04,093
So, please tell me, why should I support you?

307
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:08,139
There isn't any reason for you to do so.

308
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:11,851
If I were you, I probably
wouldn't support myself either.

309
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,765
But I'm not like Qian Ren.

310
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:20,602
Qian Ren's era of domination is over.

311
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:24,022
What matters now is cooperation and scale.

312
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:27,234
So, as long as you support me
in remaining as the chairman,

313
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:29,444
I'll reinstate the strategic alliance.

314
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:32,781
So, you want me to miss the board meeting?

315
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:34,741
Yes.

316
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:36,993
If you don't attend this board meeting,

317
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:40,205
I promise to exchange shares with Chaomai

318
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:43,542
by issuing new shares
at Hongfa's board meeting.

319
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,919
This way, both of
our shareholdings will increase.

320
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,004
A further collaboration like this

321
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:50,799
can be considered a public pledge.

322
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,545
I think it'll be very popular in the market.

323
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:00,684
No wonder you're Mr. Zhan's successor.

324
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:04,737
What do you think, Chairman Lin?

325
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:18,238
To the right! To the right!

326
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:19,914
Darn it!

327
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,245
Hurry!

328
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:26,580
Speed past!

329
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:30,466
Don't block me! Don't!

330
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:33,177
Yes!

331
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:37,097
Crap!

332
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:41,810
You have to brake when you turn!

333
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:45,689
The button here.

334
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:57,861
You're back.

335
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:59,703
Have you eaten?

336
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:33,153
Your birthday present.

337
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:38,117
It's a limited edition item
from your favorite team.

338
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:42,697
Thanks.

339
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:44,290
Eat up.

340
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:51,498
Do you want some?

341
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:53,090
Thank you.

342
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:05,644
I heard from Uncle Li that you went to see him.

343
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,105
Yes.

344
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:12,268
He said he was going to invest.

345
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:13,895
Why didn't you want it?

346
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:16,447
I want to find a more suitable investor.

347
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:20,109
If you need me...

348
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:22,036
- I'll find one for you.
- There's no need.

349
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:26,248
I have my own ways.

350
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:58,356
The birthday feast is ready.

351
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:01,533
Tomato scrambled eggs.

352
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:05,613
Even though your birthday is over,

353
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:07,574
as long as we're together,

354
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:09,325
and live each day earnestly,

355
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:12,287
it's more important than any holiday.

356
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:13,913
As long as you're with me.

357
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:15,923
Of course.

358
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:20,003
I love you.

359
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:21,629
Whether you succeed or fail,

360
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:24,348
whether you have money or not,
that's not important.

361
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,234
What is it?

362
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:40,072
Why so mysterious?

363
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:43,109
Happy birthday.

364
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:44,777
No way.

365
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:46,412
There's a present too?

366
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,329
Although this wallet is empty now,

367
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:55,705
as long as we work together,

368
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:58,549
I'm sure we can fill it up in no time.

369
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:03,095
Every dollar in it will be yours.

370
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:28,454
Thank you.

371
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,367
Let's eat.

372
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:35,578
Wait, there's one more thing missing.

373
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:37,171
What is it?

374
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:39,290
Make a wish.

375
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,625
I used to make wishes for you.

376
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,085
Now it's your turn to make one for me.

377
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:43,753
No, you're so childish.

378
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:45,088
Hands out.

379
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:46,339
You're the childish one.

380
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:47,840
Give me your hand.

381
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,475
Hurry up.

382
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:53,137
Wiggle them.

383
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:54,681
Sing.

384
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,724
Happy birthday to you.

385
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:58,059
Louder.

386
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:00,645
Happy birthday to you.

387
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:03,481
Happy birthday to you.

388
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:06,275
Happy birthday to you

389
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:08,236
- I want to make a wish.
- Happy birthday to you.

390
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:10,405
Happy birthday to you.

391
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:13,074
Happy birthday to you.

392
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:15,910
Happy birthday to you.

393
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:20,005
- Wait. Don't go over there.
- Put your hand down.

394
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:38,950
Come in.

395
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:43,604
Old Chairman Wu's secretary just called.

396
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:45,189
What did he say?

397
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:47,233
Old Chairman Wu said

398
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:48,943
if we want to talk about the board meeting,

399
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:52,405
we can just discuss it during the meeting.

400
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:55,783
He has always respected
Mr. Zhan's last wish and supported you.

401
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:57,869
But he won't see you now.

402
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:01,414
His attitude has changed so much.

403
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:04,341
I think it has something to do with the rumors.

404
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:11,966
The board meeting is tomorrow.

405
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:14,343
Chairman You said he's been
calling Old Chairman Wu's cellphone,

406
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:15,803
but he didn't pick up.

407
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:17,938
He will try again.

408
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:21,692
If Old Chairman Wu remains so resolute,

409
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:25,772
we can only count on Chairman Lin.

410
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:29,491
But the private relationship
between Chairman Lin and Chairman Qian

411
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,744
is what worries me the most.

412
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:38,701
Chairman Lin.

413
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:40,661
What did Zhou Xiao Qi offer you

414
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:42,921
for you to miss the board meeting?

415
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,875
If I become the chairman,

416
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:49,837
what Zhou Xiao Qi can give you,
I can give you, too.

417
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:51,513
She said...

418
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:55,927
she's going to form
a strategic alliance with Chaomai.

419
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:58,763
She also promised to issue new shares

420
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:01,224
and swap them with Chaomai.

421
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:03,518
We'll both increase our holdings.

422
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:07,571
Isn't this what you and Old Xin
wanted to do back then?

423
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:10,149
Yes.

424
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:14,987
Even if Zhou Xiao Qi doesn't do it, I'll do it.

425
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:16,531
As long as Zhou Xiao Qi steps down,

426
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,366
and I become the chairman,

427
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:22,578
I'll appoint you as Hongfa's Vice Chairman.

428
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:25,998
This way, you'll be both Hongfa's Vice Chairman

429
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:28,376
and Chaomai's Chairman.

430
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:31,553
Isn't that one step closer to your dream?

431
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:46,227
Chairman Lin.

432
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:50,566
Please attend Hongfa's board meeting.

433
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,833
I'll drink to that.

434
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:25,183
Any word from Chairman Lin?

435
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:27,226
I just contacted his secretary.

436
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:29,103
Chairman Lin is still considering it.

437
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:30,438
What about Old Chairman Wu?

438
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:34,275
Abla said Old Chairman Wu won't see him either.

439
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:35,909
Okay.

440
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:30,255
Thank you.

441
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:37,421
Hello, I'm Zhou Xiao Qi from Hongfa.

442
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:40,174
Please tell Old Chairman Wu I need to see him.

443
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:43,511
The chairman is having lunch.
It's not a good time.

444
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,554
I can wait for him to finish.
Just five minutes.

445
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:48,523
He really can't see anyone now.

446
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:23,517
Good afternoon.

447
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:29,242
Have a seat.

448
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:52,288
Chairman.

449
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:53,644
Chairman Lin is here.

450
00:38:53,644 --> 00:38:55,298
We don't have much time.

451
00:38:57,626 --> 00:39:00,212
Hello, Old Chairman Wu.
I'm Zhou Xiao Qi from Hongfa.

452
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:03,257
What's written in the magazine
is not true. May I explain?

453
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:06,393
Let's talk about it
at the board meeting, alright?

454
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,684
Old Chairman Wu.

455
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:15,519
Please give our chairman a chance to explain.

456
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:17,938
It's really not what you think.

457
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:19,322
Old Chairman Wu.

458
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:31,334
What are you doing?

459
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:35,081
I just need you to give me a chance to explain.

460
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:36,707
I don't think that's necessary.

461
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,417
Let's talk when you get up.

462
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:40,294
What's written in the magazine is not true.

463
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:42,846
I hope you don't believe
the unscrupulous media.

464
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:46,092
Of course, I know the media can't be trusted.

465
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:48,135
But where there's smoke, there's fire.

466
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:50,096
Where did those rumors
within the company come from?

467
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:52,515
It's because they want to oust me.

468
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:55,059
So, they maliciously slandered me
and spread rumors.

469
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:57,144
Do you have proof?

470
00:39:57,144 --> 00:39:58,771
No.

471
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:01,531
But I can prove that they're lying.

472
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:08,747
This is my husband,
Zhan Qian Ren's death certificate.

473
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:12,743
He really died of acute myocardial infarction.

474
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:16,755
A few months ago,
he underwent surgery for this.

475
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:19,708
He survived.

476
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:21,683
But this time...

477
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:30,177
No matter what,

478
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:33,730
I'll protect his company with my life.

479
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:38,109
It's the only thing he left me and our child.

480
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:41,137
Old Chairman Wu, please.

481
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:52,374
All right.

482
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:56,328
I won't attend the board meeting today.

483
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:59,081
Get up. You're pregnant.

484
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:00,624
Thank you, Old Chairman Wu.

485
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:02,501
Thank you, Old Chairman Wu.

486
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:04,253
You don't have to thank me.

487
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:06,385
At the shareholders' meeting in a few months,

488
00:41:06,385 --> 00:41:07,923
the board members will be reelected.

489
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:10,342
As one of the company's founders,

490
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:12,136
I'm also responsible for the shareholders.

491
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,555
As for whether you're fit
to run this company,

492
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:18,483
it will depend on your performance.

493
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:22,021
I understand.

494
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:23,397
Thank you, Old Chairman Wu.

495
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:24,990
Thank you, Old Chairman Wu.

496
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:43,334
I didn't expect Zhou Xiao Qi
to stop Old Chairman Wu.

497
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,085
I underestimated her.

498
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:46,795
She knelt down!

499
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:48,672
My goodness.

500
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:50,966
She pulled off such a sensational act.

501
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:52,384
She really is a tough cookie.

502
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:55,103
I'm starting to admire her.

503
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:58,224
Sis, you know what?

504
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:00,601
Lin Xi Ming's wife called me yesterday.

505
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:03,312
She said Yi Fu had a blind date.

506
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:04,605
But he stood her up.

507
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:06,857
I've been apologizing nonstop.

508
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:08,108
When you have the time,

509
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:12,071
get Yi Fu to meet Lin Feng Hua again.

510
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:15,324
Does Lin Xi Ming want to merge the company

511
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:16,700
or marry off his daughter?

512
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,912
Chairman Lin only has one daughter,
and you only have one son.

513
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:23,465
Aren't we talking about the same thing?

514
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:27,920
In terms of business,

515
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:32,091
although we can't form
a strategic alliance with Chairman Lin yet,

516
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:36,353
a personal alliance is still possible.

517
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:40,307
But Yi Fu...

518
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:42,726
I think Yi Fu is tired of Pan Xin Tong now.

519
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:44,061
Now is the best time

520
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:46,230
to seamlessly transition to Lin Feng Hua.

521
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,281
It's perfect, isn't it?

522
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:52,152
I'm not so sure anymore.

523
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:57,199
Yi Fu seems different this time.

524
00:42:57,199 --> 00:42:59,834
Is Pan Xin Tong that charming?

525
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:04,297
No matter how good she is, I won't agree to it.

526
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:09,044
But Yi Fu has been back for a few days.

527
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:13,257
My relationship with him
has finally mellowed out.

528
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:16,142
I don't want to fight with him
over this anymore.

529
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:18,053
Okay.

530
00:43:18,053 --> 00:43:20,681
Sis, don't worry.

531
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:23,900
Leave this to me.

532
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:03,603
I'm sorry about the other day.

533
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:10,238
How did it go with Xin Tong?

534
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,088
It was fine.

535
00:44:18,405 --> 00:44:20,603
What are you going to do now?

536
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:25,044
I don't know.

537
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:27,881
Get a job.

538
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:31,210
A job?

539
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:33,754
Do you think a few thousand dollars
a month is enough?

540
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:34,838
This is nonsensical.

541
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:36,215
Apologize to your mom.

542
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:37,682
No way.

543
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:40,310
It's so embarrassing.

544
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:48,268
Thank you.

545
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:49,561
Why are you here?

546
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:53,023
Your mom wants to
partner with Chaomai's Chairman Lin.

547
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:54,525
They'll use a different concept

548
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:58,036
to open a few different department stores.

549
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:01,031
Why does she want to do that all of a sudden?

550
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:05,577
She wants to work with Chaomai
to create a new model.

551
00:45:05,577 --> 00:45:08,580
The kind that's guaranteed to be successful.

552
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:11,667
Do you know that once your mom
gets Hongfa's management rights,

553
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:15,887
she can launch a strategic alliance
between three companies.

554
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:19,591
I remember you said

555
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:23,512
you wanted to open a cosmetics
and coffee fusion store, right?

556
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:26,814
It's great. You can do it.

557
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:33,188
Okay, I get it.

558
00:45:33,188 --> 00:45:37,735
You want to start a business to prove
your capability to your mom, right?

559
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:39,528
But be honest with yourself.

560
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:41,739
Is the process going well?

561
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:44,616
Are you kidding me? Capitalism is so cruel.

562
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:47,411
You have no money or connections.
How can you succeed?

563
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:49,121
Do you want to make a fool out of me?

564
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:50,539
Do you think you look funny?

565
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:51,721
Why would your mom laugh at you?

566
00:45:51,721 --> 00:45:53,542
Your mom loves you.

567
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:55,127
Do you know that because of this,

568
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:56,523
your mom was worried about your reputation,

569
00:45:56,523 --> 00:45:58,505
so she asked me, your uncle, to speak to you.

570
00:45:58,505 --> 00:46:01,175
Do you think I have nothing better to do?

571
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:03,802
Your mom is not as cold-blooded as you think.

572
00:46:03,802 --> 00:46:05,395
She even...

573
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:10,483
She even needs you more than you think.

574
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:17,191
Do you know...

575
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:20,076
Xiao Qi used her ultimate trick today.

576
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:24,239
She's pregnant, but she knelt down!

577
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:26,074
She almost scared me to death.

578
00:46:26,074 --> 00:46:28,535
Luckily, she used this trick.

579
00:46:28,535 --> 00:46:31,580
She succeeded and retained
her position as chairman.

580
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:33,923
Qian Li Hua must be furious.

581
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:42,140
I didn't mean it that way.

582
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:47,270
I don't mind. I'm happy for you, too.

583
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:52,351
Really?

584
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:55,020
It's one thing for me to upset your mom,

585
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:57,940
but I even stood up to her for Xiao Qi.

586
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:00,992
I'm afraid you'll be caught in the middle.

587
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:03,620
I won't.

588
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:07,624
Xin Tong.

589
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:11,002
If...

590
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:16,625
If I go back to Snoopy's, would you mind?

591
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:18,544
You want to go back?

592
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:20,678
Do you think I'm lame?

593
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:23,131
I've been out for a while.

594
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:25,183
I've lost all my money.

595
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:28,186
I guess I still have to go back.

596
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:33,183
Do you want to go back,
or is your mom forcing you to do so?

597
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:34,859
She isn't.

598
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:37,604
My mom should know it's useless
to force me into anything.

599
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:40,691
She let me decide this time.

600
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:42,659
Actually, I'm worried...

601
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:45,787
you'll object.

602
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:48,490
Why would I object?

603
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:50,367
I'm Xiao Qi's chief secretary.

604
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:52,077
That's your mom.

605
00:47:52,077 --> 00:47:55,672
We're just doing what we should, aren't we?

606
00:47:57,624 --> 00:47:59,039
Yes.

607
00:48:00,502 --> 00:48:02,212
But we have to make a vow.

608
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:05,723
We can't let our differences
affect our relationship.

609
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:12,071
I swear.

610
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:27,988
Welcome. Do you have a reservation?

611
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:29,156
Mr. Gu. Table for two.

612
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:30,699
He's already here. This way.

613
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:32,291
Thank you.

614
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:39,966
Sorry, the meeting ran late.

615
00:48:40,792 --> 00:48:42,169
Are you hungry?

616
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:44,087
I'm okay. Let's have a salad.

617
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:45,422
Okay.

618
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:48,099
There's seafood salad here.

619
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:53,521
I'm going to the restroom.

620
00:49:02,028 --> 00:49:06,083
[Let's go elsewhere.
See you at the parking lot.]
