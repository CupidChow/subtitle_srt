[Six years ago]

2
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:23,232
I love you.

3
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:30,467
Get out of the car.

4
00:00:31,322 --> 00:00:34,409
- I love you.
- Get out.

5
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:36,036
- I love you.
- Get out.

6
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,800
If you don't get out, we'll die together!

7
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:45,003
Get out! Get lost!

8
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:46,747
Get lost!

9
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:58,189
Love means...

10
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:03,354
For a goal that's
more important than yourself...

11
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:06,637
you choose to live or die.

12
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:14,968
[Episode 7: Until death do us part?]

13
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,332
[I'm back. Remember the cabin?
I'm waiting for you there.]

14
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,535
Why are you here?

15
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:42,734
What if someone sees you?

16
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:46,524
I'm worried about you.

17
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:52,521
What did the doctor say?

18
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:57,569
The doctor said two-thirds
of his heart muscle is damaged.

19
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:00,491
He's still in a coma.

20
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:04,499
What if he wakes up?

21
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:08,769
Have you notified the company?

22
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,241
I don't dare to tell anyone.

23
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,199
If I wait until he's gone,

24
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,409
it'll only arouse more suspicion.

25
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:23,968
You must inform the company first.

26
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:31,849
Don't worry.

27
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:34,446
I'm here.

28
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,356
Where are you going?

29
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:48,353
I'm moving in with Xin Tong.

30
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,146
What did you say?

31
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:52,124
Xin Tong needs me now.

32
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:56,204
Unpack your clothes and put them back.

33
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:00,073
I'm just moving out.

34
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,033
I'll still handle company matters.

35
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,605
Don't worry.

36
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,663
What's wrong with you?

37
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:11,251
You've never gone this far for a woman before.

38
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,585
I told you.

39
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:14,545
Xin Tong is different from other girls.

40
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:16,339
When she's feeling a bit better,

41
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,924
I'll bring her home to have dinner with you.

42
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,634
Then you'll understand what I mean.

43
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:22,641
You can't go anywhere without my permission.

44
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,546
Xin Yi Fu!

45
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,062
Xin Yi Fu!

46
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,397
That's enough.

47
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,557
Xin Tong is waiting for me at home.

48
00:04:33,557 --> 00:04:35,024
I can't let her wait alone for too long.

49
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:36,401
That's enough!

50
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,945
It's always "Xin Tong this," "Xin Tong that."

51
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,905
How long have you known her?

52
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:43,324
Now, you're disobeying me because of her.

53
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:45,451
Don't be so dramatic.

54
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,550
I'm not running away from home.

55
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,748
Fine.

56
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:52,458
If you're moving out,

57
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,920
you might as well quit your job
at the company, too.

58
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,381
I don't think you should be
the vice president anymore.

59
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:01,033
Let's see how well you can do out there.

60
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:15,773
Fine, I'll quit.

61
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:18,525
You've always just doubted me anyway.

62
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:22,497
I don't even know what
I'm supposed to do in this company.

63
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:02,547
Do you see that?

64
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,340
Your mom is glaring at you.

65
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,010
She wants to see if you're living happily.

66
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:15,351
My mom isn't glaring at me.

67
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:17,765
She's clearly smiling happily.

68
00:07:20,014 --> 00:07:21,660
You're right.

69
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:26,904
But your mom seems to be glaring at me.

70
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:28,239
Because I promised her

71
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:31,031
that I'd make you happy.

72
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,163
If your mom turns into a ghost,

73
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,981
will she come for me?

74
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,499
Do you have a cigarette?

75
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,879
Do you have a cigarette?

76
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,798
Son-in-law, do you have a cigarette?

77
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,650
All right.

78
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:58,051
I'll pull myself together.

79
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:00,897
- Okay.
- Good.

80
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:03,367
Okay, thank you.

81
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:07,069
- Good morning, Chief Secretary Zhao.
- Morning.

82
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:13,827
Are you all right?

83
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,620
Don't push yourself.

84
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,080
Don't worry about me. I'm fine.

85
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,500
I'm sorry for troubling you with work.

86
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,752
Now that I'm back,
let me know if you need anything.

87
00:08:23,752 --> 00:08:24,754
Okay.

88
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,923
Mr. You and Mr. Zhan have a meeting today.

89
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:29,008
I can introduce you to him.

90
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,890
Mr. You is already inside.

91
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:35,431
Who is this Mr. You?

92
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:38,100
Mr. You? Everyone calls him Abla.

93
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,228
He used to be Mr. Zhan's driver.

94
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,230
Don't be fooled by his appearance.

95
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:46,025
He's now Mr. Zhan's go-to guy
for the stock market.

96
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,156
Mr. You.

97
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:54,158
Hello, Mr. You.
I'm Pan Xin Tong, the secretary.

98
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:55,576
Mr. You?

99
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,411
I'm still inexperienced.

100
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:59,582
Just call me Abla.

101
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,500
Don't scare our girls.

102
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:07,048
Xin Tong is still young,
but she's very capable.

103
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,467
Then we'll get along well.

104
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:14,060
I like capable people.

105
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,021
Mr. Zhan isn't here yet?

106
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:10,838
You're here.

107
00:10:10,838 --> 00:10:13,039
Long time no see.

108
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,279
You sent the video, didn't you?

109
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,752
I know that woman married the old man.

110
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,503
You were dumped.

111
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,838
So, I came back.

112
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:32,798
To get back at us?

113
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:35,885
Why would you think that? I'm not that evil.

114
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:38,346
Why would I hurt you?

115
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:39,721
I bought a lot of food.

116
00:10:39,721 --> 00:10:40,765
I've also bought wine.

117
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,266
It'll be enough for a few days.

118
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:43,678
Come on.

119
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,192
What are you doing?

120
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,443
Where's the money?

121
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:55,446
You're not recording this, are you?

122
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:58,282
You're so silly.

123
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:00,826
Trust me, okay?

124
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:04,372
I'm back now, and I'll transfer the money back.

125
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,998
I mean it.

126
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:09,251
Stop recording. Trust me, okay?

127
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:11,565
Or you can go to the bank with me tomorrow.

128
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:15,733
Let's go. It's hot.

129
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,679
Zhan Qian Ren is still unconscious.

130
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,223
His condition is still not optimistic.

131
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,974
You have to be mentally prepared.

132
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:27,062
It might happen in a day or two.

133
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:36,578
How did Mr. Zhan suddenly end up like this?

134
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,162
This won't do. Let's transfer him.

135
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:46,831
I know a cardiologist.

136
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,958
I'm sure he can save Mr. Zhan.

137
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,931
I'll contact him.

138
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:56,382
Ma'am, I'll go back to the office
and inform the board members.

139
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,300
Thank you for your help at the hospital.

140
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,645
Call me if you need anything.

141
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,954
Thin crust or thick crust for the pizza?

142
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:19,780
Thin crust.

143
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,506
Okay.

144
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,562
This should be enough.

145
00:12:29,051 --> 00:12:30,527
Here.

146
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:44,805
Look at the sunlight outside.

147
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,724
It's so beautiful.

148
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:49,199
It's just like what I saw in New Zealand.

149
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:51,270
You know what?

150
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,939
During my trip to New Zealand,

151
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:56,859
I found it's even more beautiful
than I imagined.

152
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:59,528
Time moves so slowly there.

153
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:01,894
It feels like everything has stopped.

154
00:13:01,894 --> 00:13:04,163
[Xiao Qi]

155
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:11,055
It's so astringent.

156
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,752
Maybe it needs to breathe a bit more.

157
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,670
Aren't you going to answer it?

158
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,506
It's okay.

159
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:20,015
Should I cut the bell peppers?

160
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,171
Yes.

161
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:26,481
Are you putting them on the pizza
or making a salad?

162
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,717
Take a guess.

163
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:41,630
Since you're alone in the hospital,

164
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,734
I brought you some clothes
and daily necessities.

165
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,856
Thank you.

166
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,939
You haven't eaten, have you?

167
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,061
I'm not hungry.

168
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:57,907
You can't do that.

169
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,996
This is light. You should eat some.

170
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,827
I'll eat with you.

171
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,964
Yours looks better.

172
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:26,008
Do you want some?

173
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,437
Yes.

174
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,913
Thank you.

175
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,789
You rarely eat convenience store food, do you?

176
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,666
Speaking of convenience store food,

177
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,995
I'm a professional
convenience store foodie of many years,

178
00:16:00,995 --> 00:16:02,050
also known as a budget expert.

179
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:04,213
I can give you some tips.

180
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:07,216
If you want fresh food, you have to dig for it.

181
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,343
The clerks usually put
the soon-to-expire food out front.

182
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:10,928
So, the deeper inside, the fresher.

183
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:13,055
Here's another money-saving tip
for those who live paycheck to paycheck.

184
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:16,433
You must grab bargains
during the discount period for expiring items.

185
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,227
Every convenience store has different timings.

186
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,521
Some are at 5 P.M., some are at 7 P.M.

187
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:21,981
It depends on when you go to grab them.

188
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,108
Also, 12 A.M. and early morning

189
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,318
are when convenience stores restock.

190
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,862
Food that's about to expire
becomes very cheap then.

191
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:30,322
Especially rice balls.

192
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,162
How did you know?

193
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:38,706
Why didn't you ask me what happened?

194
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,916
Everyone's curious.

195
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,043
My mom's in the hospital a lot.

196
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:45,254
I hate questions like that.

197
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:46,961
So, I understand.

198
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:56,074
I used to be a convenience store expert, too.

199
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,244
Aren't you going to eat?

200
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:09,319
I'm not hungry.

201
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,291
It's delicious.

202
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:20,188
Hello?

203
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,959
The doctor said

204
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:27,629
he's in critical condition,
and he only has a day or two left.

205
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:29,381
I see.

206
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:32,342
What about you? Are you okay?

207
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:33,786
I'm fine.

208
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:36,528
The money should be wired back.

209
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,352
I'm worried...

210
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:45,522
we can't hide the test results.

211
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:47,129
Give me a minute.

212
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:56,909
Here's the thing.

213
00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:00,370
A doctor is obligated
to keep a patient's condition confidential.

214
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,122
If the information is leaked,

215
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:05,000
they'll have to take legal responsibility.

216
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,253
You're his legal wife now.

217
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:10,839
Even if the baby isn't his,

218
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:13,286
you can still inherit his assets.

219
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,512
So, I'm thinking that...

220
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,055
if we hadn't met...

221
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,487
I know.

222
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:23,519
Let's not think about what happened.

223
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,687
Hang in there.

224
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:27,042
Okay.

225
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:37,488
You're studying so hard
for the college entrance exam.

226
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,894
I'm reading about small farmers.

227
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:44,164
Small farmers? What small farmers?

228
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:47,626
I met some farmers when I was
on a business trip in the south.

229
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,962
They're looking for a partner
to start a skincare brand.

230
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,114
But they're still short on funds.

231
00:18:52,114 --> 00:18:56,990
I think I'll talk to some friends and elders.

232
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,481
You've changed.

233
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,269
Who are you? I almost don't recognize you.

234
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:08,772
How dare you fall out with your mom
and not even show up to work?

235
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:11,503
Looks like you're serious
about Xin Tong this time.

236
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:16,725
I want to use this opportunity to prove myself.

237
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:22,033
So, this is what true love is like.

238
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,513
Here.

239
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:43,056
Let's get started. Attorney Ren, you go first.

240
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:45,462
Okay. Thank you, Mr. Huang.

241
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:49,980
Mr. Zhan stated in
the revised will trust after marriage

242
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,440
that if anything happens to him,

243
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,650
all his assets will be transferred

244
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:59,204
through the trust to Ms. Zhou Xiao Qi.

245
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:10,114
Attorney Ren, what do you suggest?

246
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:14,463
I suggest that before Mr. Zhan passes away,

247
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,215
we hold an emergency board meeting

248
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,009
and nominate Zhou Xiao Qi to replace Mr. Zhan

249
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:21,136
as the Chairman of Hongfa.

250
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:23,180
Stop fooling around!

251
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,785
Zhou Xiao Qi knows nothing.

252
00:20:24,785 --> 00:20:27,684
It's absurd for her to be chairman.

253
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:29,645
Maybe she tried to kill Mr. Zhan.

254
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,251
Vice President Qian.

255
00:20:46,164 --> 00:20:47,625
Let's go.

256
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:53,919
"Hongfa's Chairman Zhan had
a heart attack and is in critical condition."

257
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,164
Did you see the news?

258
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:01,635
That woman is pregnant with your child.

259
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,303
She's afraid she won't get the inheritance.

260
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:05,584
So, you teamed up to kill him?

261
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,110
You've got quite the imagination.

262
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:17,648
Don't think I don't know what you're up to.

263
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:22,281
You're his legal wife now.

264
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,908
Even if the baby isn't his,

265
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:27,228
you can still inherit his fortune.

266
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,084
You bugged my phone?

267
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:36,795
That woman made you so scary.

268
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:39,253
You're capable of murder now.

269
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,594
Are you going to kill me, too?

270
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:47,264
Since when?

271
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:51,768
It's a blessing to die by your hand.

272
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:53,895
Do it.

273
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:55,741
Kill me.

274
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:15,010
Stay for one last dinner with me.

275
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:18,993
Then I'll go back to New Zealand.

276
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:22,259
I'm tired.

277
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,294
Oh, Sis.

278
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:01,630
You've worked so hard
your whole life just to get Hongfa.

279
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,840
Now that Mr. Zhan is finally dying,

280
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,675
a great opportunity is coming.

281
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:08,512
Do you really want Zhou Xiao Qi
to become chairman?

282
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:09,721
Calm down.

283
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:13,092
I can't calm down. I can't accept this.

284
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,318
I know.

285
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:25,529
How about I persuade Mr. Huang?

286
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:27,656
I'll get him to support you
in the board meeting.

287
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:29,492
Plus, we'll have the seats under our directors.

288
00:23:29,492 --> 00:23:30,492
See?

289
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,244
You'll definitely be the chairman.

290
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,947
Don't be so impatient.

291
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:38,208
As long as Mr. Zhan is still alive,

292
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,572
do you think Mr. Huang will listen to you?

293
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:49,094
The board election is coming up soon.

294
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:55,111
By then, it'll be easy to remove her.

295
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:01,692
Hello, this is the secretary's office.

296
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:16,121
Hello.

297
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,914
Are you Ms. Pan?

298
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:20,099
- Yes.
- This way, please.

299
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:36,600
Director Qian.

300
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,106
Have a seat.

301
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,567
That's bird's nest.

302
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,944
Yi Fu likes to eat it
in the morning or before bed.

303
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:49,529
Take it home.

304
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:51,198
He's prone to nasal allergies.

305
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:53,283
He can't stand a speck of dust.

306
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:55,738
Make sure your house is clean.

307
00:24:57,704 --> 00:25:01,195
Why did you ask me to come here?

308
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:06,137
Do you know there was
a class system in the Roman era?

309
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,340
In ancient Rome,

310
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:12,636
there were three classes
of aristocrats, commoners, and slaves.

311
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:17,307
In our time,
wealthy capitalists are aristocrats.

312
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:21,019
Ordinary professionals are commoners.

313
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:22,479
Office workers like you,

314
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:25,106
who sell their time to the company,

315
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:27,448
are basically slaves.

316
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,493
What are you trying to say?

317
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:34,533
Yi Fu's father and I
built everything from scratch.

318
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:37,160
It will all be left to Yi Fu.

319
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,579
He has connections, wealth,

320
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:41,665
education, and experience.

321
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:43,047
What about you?

322
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:45,417
What do you have?

323
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:53,760
Director Qian, if I may be so bold...

324
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,888
It's 2023, and you're still
talking about ancient Rome.

325
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:59,498
No wonder Yi Fu can't communicate with you.

326
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,894
Everyone has their own values.

327
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:06,529
What's important to you
may not be important to others.

328
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:09,859
I admire your ambition.

329
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:14,098
But this time, you've chosen the wrong person.

330
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:17,492
I have to admit,

331
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:21,413
you're more resourceful than I thought.

332
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:24,207
You not only made Yi Fu
move out to live with you,

333
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:27,669
you even made him break ties
with me and leave the company.

334
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:29,754
But let me remind you,

335
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:32,507
if Xin Yi Fu has nothing,

336
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:34,590
will you still love him?

337
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:40,849
Don't think you've won.

338
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:43,001
This is just the beginning.

339
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,230
One more thing.

340
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:50,233
Don't buy too many personal items for Yi Fu.

341
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:52,521
He'll be coming back soon.

342
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:45,212
Do you remember the story of this lighter?

343
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:51,211
It's the only thing your dad left you.

344
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:53,472
You still remember.

345
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,427
The day you decided to kill yourself
after your mom died...

346
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:04,533
At the cliff, what was
the last thing I said to you?

347
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:14,192
Love is to live for a purpose

348
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:17,034
more important than yourself.

349
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,370
Your turn.

350
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,423
Ask me a question.

351
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:34,005
There must be one.

352
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:47,000
Why do you love me?

353
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:51,343
Because you're handsome.

354
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:55,550
Because you're a doctor.

355
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:01,532
Because you asked me for a massage.

356
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:08,556
Thank you for everything you've done for me.

357
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:12,062
I'd be dead if it weren't for you.

358
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:50,515
What did you give me to drink?

359
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:55,376
Did you put something in the wine?

360
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:57,507
Don't worry.

361
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:04,000
It's just sleeping pills.

362
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:10,725
You'll just fall asleep.

363
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:13,036
You won't feel a thing.

364
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,054
I'll be with you soon.

365
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,169
Clear.

366
00:30:44,056 --> 00:30:45,517
Clear.

367
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:50,947
Six years ago...

368
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:54,546
we should have died together.

369
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:59,649
We didn't have to wait until this day.

370
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:00,859
Yue Jiao.

371
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,527
Listen to me.

372
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:05,179
Put down the knife.

373
00:31:05,179 --> 00:31:07,418
Put down the knife first.

374
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:12,057
Stop recording.

375
00:31:12,057 --> 00:31:14,497
Who is it even for?

376
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:18,334
No one will see it.

377
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:20,529
Let go.

378
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:28,094
Love...

379
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:35,064
It's living or dying is for a purpose
more important than yourself.

380
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:32,506
I've contacted them.

381
00:32:32,506 --> 00:32:34,619
The V.I.P ward has been arranged.

382
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,857
We can transfer him at any time.

383
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:41,094
Clear. Shock.

384
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:44,619
Continue.

385
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:54,389
Continuing CPR will only
make Mr. Zhan suffer more.

386
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:58,710
Why don't you consider letting him go in peace?

387
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:14,047
Okay.

388
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:26,337
Patient Zhan Qian Ren is pronounced dead.

389
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:29,540
Time of death, 6:10 P.M.

390
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,426
Is this Mrs. Zhan?

391
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:39,971
I'm Dr. Wu.

392
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:44,375
I'm calling to check on how Mr. Zhan is doing.

393
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:46,545
He just passed away.

394
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,897
What a pity.

395
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:52,817
He didn't get to hear the DNA results in time.

396
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:56,904
You are carrying his biological child.

397
00:35:56,904 --> 00:35:58,998
And the child's healthy.

398
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:04,745
I'm sorry. I shan't bother you then.

399
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:06,600
My condolences.

400
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:41,831
Miss, are you all right?

401
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:46,999
I don't want it.

402
00:36:48,044 --> 00:36:50,020
What's the matter?

403
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:55,004
Go away!

404
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:56,881
- Miss, are you all right?
- Let go of me!

405
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:59,091
- Please, take a seat.
- Go away!

406
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:02,019
- Calm down.
- You calm down!

407
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:20,446
Why are you doing this to me?

408
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:23,658
Why?

409
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:25,513
Why?

410
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,479
Xiao Qi!

411
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:54,585
Do you want me to buy you a nail clipper?

412
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:57,561
No need.

413
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:08,132
I've brought Mr. Zhan's clothes.

414
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:17,491
I'll get the nurse.

415
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:45,484
- Gu Hou Ze!
- It's all right now.

416
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:48,195
Gu Hou Ze!

417
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:50,448
Gu Hou Ze!

418
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,241
- Gu Hou Ze!
- It's all right.

419
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:53,951
- Gu Hou Ze!
- Keep her down.

420
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:55,453
- Gu Hou Ze!
- Hold her tight.

421
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:58,664
Gu Hou Ze, come in!

422
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:00,291
Gu Hou Ze, don't stand there!

423
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:01,292
- Come in!
- Don't move!

424
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,919
- Gu Hou Ze!
- All right. It's all right.

425
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:06,005
Gu Hou Ze!

426
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:08,340
- Gu Hou Ze!
- It's all right now.

427
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:11,051
Gu Hou Ze!

428
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:13,721
Gu Hou Ze!

429
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,993
- Gu Hou Ze!
- It's all right.

430
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,780
Didn't you tell me about this case before?

431
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,949
Yes.
[Borderline personality disorder, BPD]

432
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:35,993
She has borderline personality disorder.

433
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:37,503
Actually...

434
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:43,459
we used to date.

435
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:46,337
She has severe delusional jealousy.

436
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,255
She'll imagine I'm having
an abnormal relationship

437
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:50,508
with other female patients.

438
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:55,016
She'll also make up things that never happened.

439
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:59,558
How was she with the medication before?

440
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:01,018
She was very resistant to it.

441
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:03,062
It doesn't sound like she's doing well.

442
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:04,546
Yes.

443
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:10,319
She's also starting to hurt others and herself.

444
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:12,279
Considering she has no other family members,

445
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:15,938
that's why I initiated
this compulsory hospitalization.

446
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:19,641
I hope she can rest here under your care.

447
00:42:20,721 --> 00:42:22,048
All right.

448
00:42:23,165 --> 00:42:25,584
If it's convenient, please give me a copy

449
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:27,478
of her previous medical records.

450
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:30,506
Okay.

451
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:33,031
That's all. I'll make the arrangements.

452
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:50,985
Ms. Zhou.

453
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:55,614
This is the paternity test report
from the nail sample you sent.

454
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:59,159
The doctor will explain it in detail later.

455
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:00,806
Thank you.

[DNA test results of sample from Zhan Qian Ren
shows he is the father of Zhou Xiao Qi's child]

458
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,591
Don't be nervous, dear.

459
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:59,386
The surgery will be over
in about 10 or 20 minutes.

460
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:00,471
Relax.

461
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:04,027
Once the anesthesia kicks in,
you won't feel a thing.

462
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:09,647
I don't want to.

463
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,958
I don't want to.

464
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,966
Hello, Chairwoman.

465
00:44:37,257 --> 00:44:38,425
Hello, Chairwoman.

Hello, Chairwoman.

467

- Hello, Chairwoman.
- Hello, Chairwoman.

468

- Hello, Chairwoman.

470
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:17,923
All assets under Mr. Zhan's name
have been transferred to an inheritance trust.

471
00:45:17,923 --> 00:45:21,176
I will assist in managing this estate

472
00:45:21,176 --> 00:45:23,095
according to the trust
Mr. Zhan established during his lifetime.

473
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:26,640
Aside from daily living
and necessary expenses for raising the child,

474
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:30,894
the trust will provide you
with a monthly allowance of 250,000 yuan.

475
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:34,398
As for Mr. Zhan's unfinished term
as Hongfa's chairman,

476
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:38,444
it has been approved
by the board of directors for you to succeed.

477
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:40,821
These are all Mr. Zhan's arrangements.

478
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:43,657
The chairwoman's monthly salary
will be 750,000 yuan.

479
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:45,242
I believe this income

480
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:48,523
can provide financial security
for you and your child.

481
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:53,751
Excuse me, Attorney Ren.

482
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:56,128
Actually, I don't understand
how the company works at all.

483
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:58,255
Can I just sell my company shares

484
00:45:58,255 --> 00:46:00,966
and not worry about anything?

485
00:46:00,966 --> 00:46:04,678
There's a 20-year limit
to the inheritance trust.

486
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:06,638
What does that mean?

487
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:10,142
It means that before the child turns 20,

488
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:14,062
all the real estate and Hongfa shares
under Mr. Zhan's name

489
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:15,826
cannot be sold.

490
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:20,152
- But...
- Mr. Zhan made this arrangement

491
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:23,155
because he hopes you will
manage the company well,

492
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:26,577
and also raise your child
to be an outstanding entrepreneur.
