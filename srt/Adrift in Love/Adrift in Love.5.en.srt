1
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:28,445
Excuse me.

2
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:31,072
Is Mr. Gu Hou Ze here?

3
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:33,707
Do you have an appointment?

4
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:40,047
Do we look sick?

5
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:43,376
It's you. You look sick.

6
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:44,836
Let's meet at the same time next week.

7
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:46,762
Okay. Thank you, Dr. Gu.

8
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:52,260
How may I help you?

9
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,928
Are you Gu Hou Ze?

10
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:55,604
Yes, that's me.

11
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:03,445
Don't you think the debt should be settled?

12
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not sure what you're talking about.

13
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,303
Goodness.

14
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:22,715
Isn't your name all over these?

15
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,947
Call Ms. Fan first.

16
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:43,019
I think a Ms. Fan borrowed money
from you under my name.

17
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:46,697
But I'm not sure about the actual situation.

18
00:02:26,592 --> 00:02:30,562
[Episode 5: Are we sick or is love twisted?]

19
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:43,747
Hello?

20
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:46,916
- Hello, is this Miss Fan Yue Jiao?
- Yes.

21
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:49,419
I'm Commissioner Chen from Fubon Bank's
Foreign Exchange Department.

22
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:52,130
Your foreign currency transaction
has been processed.

23
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,341
Account details will be sent
to your email shortly.

24
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:57,677
Please check it. Thank you.

25
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:58,678
Okay, thank you.

26
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,146
I'll contact you if I have any questions.

27
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,903
I've compiled the results
of the past two years' art auctions.

28
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,529
I found that this kind of abstract painting

29
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:19,449
is starting to attract collectors.

30
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:23,912
Also, the Japanese New Generation
artists you've bought and sold

31
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:26,039
all seem to be of this type.

32
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,373
Why don't you talk to them again?

33
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,633
See if there are any new works.

34
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:32,761
Okay.

35
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:39,393
Are you okay?

36
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:49,187
Why don't we end here for today?

37
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:51,522
Mr. Zhan wants to have dinner with you
and asked me to book a restaurant.

38
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:53,490
What kind of food do you want to eat?

39
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,536
I'm going to the restroom.

40
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,095
Director Qian, Vice President.
You're here to see the paintings, too?

41
00:05:07,051 --> 00:05:09,012
[Hou Ze]

42
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,216
Pan Xin Tong.

43
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:24,574
You're taking huge strides.

44
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,034
Wow.

45
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:28,578
You're so elegant now.

46
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:32,665
I guess you've dipped your toes
into art sales and acquisitions, huh.

47
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,500
It's no surprise.

48
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,336
You're with Mr. Qian now.

49
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:40,173
It's good for you to improve yourself.

50
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,258
Excuse me, Vice President. I have to go.

51
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:44,101
Don't be in a rush.

52
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:48,222
I'm Yi Fu's uncle, after all.

53
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:49,349
Here's the thing.

54
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,601
If there's anything between you and Yi Fu,

55
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,186
you can share it with me.

56
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,480
I have a lot of tips for you.

57
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,773
Listen to me.

58
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:59,400
Often, when it comes to relationships...

59
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,452
Vice President Qian, what's the matter?

60
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:05,323
Not at all.

61
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:07,825
I'm just concerned about my employee...

62
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:10,995
my ex-employee's life.

63
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:14,624
So, she won't be exploited by her current boss.

64
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,376
Don't worry, Vice President Qian.

65
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,795
She's doing very well here.

66
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:21,972
Glad her talent hasn't been doomed
to obscurity at your place.

67
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:25,385
We're done here, right?

68
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,935
Let's go.

69
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,605
Pan Xin Tong.

70
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:34,026
Director Qian is looking for you.

71
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,571
What's going on? Let me see.

72
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,414
Let me see.

73
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,202
What are you doing?

74
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:52,829
Let go! Let go of him!

75
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,330
Let go of him!

76
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,331
Let go of him!

77
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:56,874
What are you doing?

78
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:58,418
Let go!

79
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,460
Kill him!

80
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,046
Are you two going to pay the 40 million?

81
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:04,097
Why are you still standing there? Get lost!

82
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:07,051
Why did you borrow so much money?

83
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:08,594
Oh my.

84
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,304
Mr. Gu.

85
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:11,806
I'm so sorry.

86
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:15,309
Those punks didn't know better
and got you bruised.

87
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:18,729
Please don't hold a grudge.

88
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:20,523
I don't have that much cash right now.

89
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:23,109
You need to give me some time.

90
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,236
Look at what you're saying.

91
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:30,116
You have to show your sincerity today.

92
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,409
How much do you need today?

93
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:33,202
Gosh.

94
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:35,830
Miss, are you paying for him?

95
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,290
How much?

96
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,174
Two million.

97
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,630
Did you get in touch with Ms. Fan?

98
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,674
No, but I texted her.

99
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:48,593
I'll try again.

100
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,595
I'll find a way to pay you back
the two million.

101
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:53,055
Why did you borrow so much money
from loan sharks?

102
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:54,724
I didn't.

103
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:57,393
Ms. Fan borrowed it
under my company's name.

104
00:07:57,393 --> 00:08:00,396
I'm the person in charge,
so they came to collect from me.

105
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:01,939
Cindy.

106
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:04,650
Help me check how much money
we have left in the company.

107
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,569
And the loans, too.

108
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:11,081
Didn't we disagree
on increasing the capital before?

109
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:15,286
So, you didn't know Ms. Fan borrowed money?

110
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:17,038
Don't let the other shareholders know yet.

111
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,206
Just find it and give it to me.

112
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,673
That's all for now.

113
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:27,389
By the way, why did you
come looking for me today?

114
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,543
It's nothing.

115
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:54,308
Director Qian, were you looking for me?

116
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,293
I don't like to beat around the bush.

117
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:06,837
I'll get straight to the point.

118
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:08,972
Please leave Yi Fu.

119
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:14,512
Have you asked Yi Fu for his opinion?

120
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:16,597
I've seen a lot of people like you.

121
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:19,566
Stop pretending in front of me.

122
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,784
People like me?

123
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:26,232
You know what I mean.

124
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,651
Why do you have to humiliate yourself?

125
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,154
Is this going to unfold like a TV drama?

126
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:35,658
Are you going to write me a check
for millions to get me to leave Yi Fu?

127
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:38,369
I'm not as stupid as an idol drama heroine.

128
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,670
I might really take it.

129
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:44,250
You must think you're special.

130
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,503
All of Yi Fu's girlfriends thought so, too.

131
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:50,298
But the result has been the same.

132
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,341
If you don't break up now,

133
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:55,052
you'll still be dumped within three months.

134
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:58,806
By then, you'll only hurt yourself more.

135
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:00,850
You should know.

136
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:04,228
Yi Fu has never been in a relationship
for more than three months.

137
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:08,129
What makes you think you'll be any different?

138
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,777
This is between him and me.

139
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,946
We'll handle it ourselves.

140
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:16,949
As for you, your task should be

141
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,951
to listen to your son more.

142
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,620
Respect him.

143
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,705
Are you lecturing me?

144
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:23,914
I wouldn't dare.

145
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:26,542
If that's all you want to talk about,

146
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:29,177
I won't waste your time.

147
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,901
Are you okay?

148
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,611
I'm fine, but I was so scared.

149
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,237
They even hit Dr. Gu.

150
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,205
They hit Dr. Gu?

151
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,292
Where's Dr. Gu?

152
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:10,336
- Dr. Gu left.
- Where did he go?

153
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:13,381
There was a Ms. Zhou Xiao Qi
who came for counseling.

154
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:16,425
She came when Dr. Gu was beaten up.

155
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:19,595
She said she could help pay the interest first.

156
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,305
Dr. Gu left with her just now.

157
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:23,724
Zhou Xiao Qi?

158
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:26,227
If it wasn't for her today, do you think
those gangsters would've let me off so easily?

159
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:28,688
Answer me first.
Why are you still involved with her?

160
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,898
- What other secrets do you have?
- Answer me first!

161
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:32,066
How much more did you borrow?

162
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:37,238
Coincidentally, she came to your rescue?

163
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:40,616
You wouldn't let me invest more,
so I took out a loan.

164
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:43,577
- The bank refused, so I took a private loan.
- Have you thought they'd harass the clinic?

165
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:45,287
I've never let you worry about money.

166
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:47,123
- How are we going to run the business now?
- You'll be a famous doctor and writer.

167
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:50,383
- And then you'll have affairs?
- Have you ever thought about that?

168
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,883
There's such a big trench now.

169
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:00,469
Have you thought about how to fix it?

170
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:02,180
How are you going to pay back the money?

171
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,832
I'll be honest with you.

172
00:12:03,832 --> 00:12:07,101
When I borrowed the money,
I didn't plan to pay it back.

173
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,929
I've wired the money overseas.

174
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:13,983
I've transferred it overseas.

175
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:16,243
Fan Yue Jiao, are you crazy?

176
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:25,494
Let's go to New Zealand together.

177
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:28,080
The money is enough for us to live on.

178
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,708
Are you saying we should
give up everything here

179
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,085
and go live in New Zealand?

180
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,254
What are you thinking?

181
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,630
Are you crazy?

182
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,466
You're the crazy one.

183
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,801
- You can't leave her.
- Don't drag her into everything.

184
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,470
She's the reason we're in this situation.

185
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,981
You know very well
what our relationship is like.

186
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:49,101
Okay.

187
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:52,313
It's fine if you don't want
to go to New Zealand.

188
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:54,985
But you know what's going on now, right?

189
00:12:54,985 --> 00:12:57,234
Those loan sharks will make the news.

190
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:59,653
You'll be a joke, ruined.

191
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:02,455
Let's see what you can do then.

192
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:09,671
Yue Jiao.

193
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,094
You did this on purpose, didn't you?

194
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:22,100
Wire the money back.

195
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:30,734
You promised me we'd go
to New Zealand together.

196
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,487
This time, we can finally go together.

197
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,917
Spare me, please.

198
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,843
You love me.

199
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,722
You've just temporarily forgotten.

200
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,734
Here you go. This is for you.

201
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:22,027
Do you want to order anything else?

202
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,737
We have a secret dish here.

203
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:25,322
It's not on the menu.

204
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:27,094
Chicken Feet Jelly.

205
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:33,080
Are you tired of spicy hot pot?

206
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,732
You were much more excited
last time you had it.

207
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,762
I'm not hungry.

208
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:42,840
You're not hungry?

209
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,258
I saw you didn't eat much
at the restaurant earlier.

210
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:46,302
That's why I wanted to have
spicy hot pot with you after work.

211
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,637
Can you stop caring so much about me?

212
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:50,269
What did you say?

213
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,437
Why are you daydreaming?

214
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,314
The fried dough sticks are mushy.

215
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,691
Didn't we agree on eight seconds?

216
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:02,450
What are you doing?

217
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:14,587
Let me ask you this.

218
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:18,258
Okay, go ahead.

219
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,931
It's nothing.

220
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:33,669
What? What do you want to tell me?

221
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:39,237
Stop staring. Eat up.

222
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:53,123
You'll choke.

223
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,503
What's wrong? Why are you so quiet today?

224
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,929
Why do you look so down?

225
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,926
Let me ask you something.

226
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,719
Is it true that all your girlfriends

227
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:13,062
never lasted more than three months?

228
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,309
Why do you ask?

229
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,068
Do you like me?

230
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:22,489
Answer me first.

231
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,859
I think when two people are dating,

232
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:28,070
they should end it at the best moment.

233
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,788
That's the most beautiful.

234
00:16:31,372 --> 00:16:32,923
Oh.

235
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:13,020
If we kiss, it'll have to
last more than three months.

236
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,720
Think carefully.

237
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,048
This is the interest for this period.

238
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:15,469
Sir, here's the money.

239
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,930
- Don't lose it.
- Okay.

240
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,773
You can take the book if you like it.

241
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,313
Damn.

242
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:27,815
I'm impressed.

243
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:30,283
You're still a writer.

244
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:34,042
"Reconciliation with the Self".

245
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:38,492
I have a problem.

246
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:41,203
I'm always torturing myself.

247
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:43,664
Looks like I need to read more of this book

248
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:46,152
to cultivate my soul.

249
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,428
Can I have your autograph?

250
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:02,266
Oh, right.

251
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,768
Don't just reconcile with yourself.

252
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,186
You should pay us back as soon as possible.

253
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:09,061
It's more important to settle with us.

254
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,953
Look, how about here?

255
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:24,712
If I don't get the money
the next time I'm here,

256
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:28,125
I'll take this with me.

257
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,842
It's a deal.

258
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:32,637
Thank you for the book.

259
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:40,054
Did you come back from abroad recently?

260
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:43,724
Yes, I went to Japan, and then Thailand.

261
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,684
Do you think I'm tanned?

262
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,060
No, I don't think so.

263
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,319
I don't think so.

264
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,732
Yes.

265
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,324
Cheers.

266
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:58,405
I'll treat everyone to a shot.

267
00:19:58,405 --> 00:19:59,865
That's great.

268
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:03,084
Thank you, sir.

269
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,551
Let me.

270
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,635
Your call has been forwarded to voicemail.

271
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,728
You will be charged after the beep.

272
00:21:06,812 --> 00:21:10,819
[Zhou Xiao Qi: How are you doing?]

273
00:21:10,819 --> 00:21:18,086
[Did those guys harass you again?]

274
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,970
The clinic is closed.

275
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,604
I know.

276
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:48,765
Where's Dr. Gu?

277
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:50,017
He's not here.

278
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,776
Where is he?

279
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:56,030
New Zealand.

280
00:21:57,941 --> 00:22:01,077
We're moving to New Zealand for good.

281
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:12,380
There's no need to call.
He won't answer your calls.

282
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,292
He won't see you again.

283
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:17,385
Just give up.

284
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:22,014
Sorry, the number you dialed is unavailable.

285
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:42,652
Where is he?

286
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:44,154
Sorry, the number you dialed...

287
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:46,156
- His phone is with me.
- ...is unavailable.

288
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:48,166
Please try again later.

289
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:54,338
Don't glare at me.

290
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:56,924
Show yourself out.

291
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:48,385
I went to your house. I wanted to tell you...

292
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:51,229
Are you going to New Zealand with Fan Yue Jiao?

293
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:05,284
She's threatening me with money.

294
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,747
I'll go with her first.

295
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:12,959
I'll try to get the money back.

296
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:20,125
Don't go.

297
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,419
If you go, you won't come back.

298
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:24,553
It's such a mess now.

299
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:28,467
There's nothing I can do.

300
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:31,535
I'll find a way to send you
the money I owe you.

301
00:24:57,204 --> 00:25:00,798
I've never been a choice to you, have I?

302
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:05,636
This is the best decision for everyone.

303
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:10,808
Please take good care of yourself.

304
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:16,181
Do you love Fan Yue Jiao more than you love me?

305
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,584
Is that it?

306
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:24,030
I'm sorry.

307
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:28,743
Is that your answer?

308
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:31,412
Gu Hou Ze!

309
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:16,116
Why are you out in the rain?

310
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:18,334
Come in.

311
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:21,871
Why are you looking for me?

312
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:23,582
I have something important to tell you.

313
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,841
Sit down first.

314
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,008
Xiao Qi.

315
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:35,309
You're pregnant.

316
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,472
It was confirmed during the last check-up.

317
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:43,018
I'm just as shocked as you.

318
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:46,438
I thought we'd need
medical technology to have a child.

319
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:49,031
But it really happened.

320
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:53,317
Wait a minute.

321
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:10,094
Xiao Qi, will you marry me?

322
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:13,840
You can plan the wedding as you please.

323
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,010
And I want to give you a grand wedding gift.

324
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,721
Just tell me what you want.

325
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,507
I'll definitely agree.

326
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,494
Hello?

327
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,753
When are you leaving?

328
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,550
This afternoon.

329
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,720
I want to meet you now.

330
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:07,560
Your call will be forwarded to voicemail.

331
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,029
You will be charged after the beep.

332
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,188
Yue Jiao.

333
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,046
Yue Jiao.

334
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:10,673
Why did you let me in here?

335
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:16,387
Can you do me a favor?

336
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:40,661
Can you change into this?

337
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:45,040
These are Shu Juan's clothes.

338
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:49,336
Today is the second anniversary
of her and Xiao An's passing.

339
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:53,291
I can't believe a car accident

340
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:56,135
took them both away from me.

341
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:03,507
Sure.

342
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:23,412
When Shu Juan was around,

343
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,492
we used to go dancing a lot.

344
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:29,418
Those days...

345
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:32,254
were truly wonderful.

346
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:08,957
You didn't bring an umbrella again, did you?

347
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:11,168
I'll give you a ride.

348
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:18,133
You can take my car. I'll give you a ride.

349
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:25,174
Haven't we decided to be friends?

350
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:28,261
Please don't keep doing things
that'll cause misunderstandings.

351
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:29,804
What do you mean by that?

352
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:30,984
But it's raining heavily.

353
00:31:30,984 --> 00:31:32,473
Take my car. I'll give you a ride.

354
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:34,358
Don't overthink it.

355
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:12,764
Get in the car. You're all wet.

356
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,349
I want to take the bus.

357
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,184
Why take the bus when I can drive you?

358
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,769
I love taking the bus.

359
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,695
Your car is uncomfortable.

360
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:25,044
Fuck.

361
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:32,909
Can you stop being so difficult?

362
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:35,169
I'm not as casual as you.

363
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:40,458
I may have only dated for a short time,

364
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,543
but I've never cheated.

365
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:43,920
Isn't that great?

366
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,588
You only date for three months.

367
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:47,306
It's just a fling.

368
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:58,317
How long do you want it to last?

369
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,439
Sir.

370
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:06,776
It's normal for relationships
to have ups and downs.

371
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:09,988
I'm not someone who needs it to last forever.

372
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:12,615
Who sets a time limit like that?

373
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:14,492
Then don't set one.

374
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:16,744
Let's just try to be together.

375
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:18,918
We'll see how long it lasts.

376
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:26,838
Let's date.

377
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,244
What do you think?

378
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:39,267
How can you say that so casually?

379
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:41,644
Who knows if you're serious or not?

380
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:43,062
I'm not made of time.

381
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:46,156
Why would I put in so much effort
to lie to you?

382
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:53,489
So, you're willing to bend
your principles for me?

383
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:56,084
You seemed really reluctant before.

384
00:33:57,243 --> 00:34:00,580
I was figuring out what I should do.

385
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:03,791
I thought I'd talk to you
when I'd made up my mind.

386
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:06,127
Besides, it was so awkward between us.

387
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:07,761
How could I speak my mind?

388
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:11,090
You didn't say anything.

389
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:13,885
Of course I'd think you were avoiding me.

390
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:16,863
I rushed back because
I didn't want you to think that way.

391
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:22,602
I met some farmers when I was
on a business trip in the south.

392
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:25,480
They were growing the flowers they bred.

393
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,858
The flowers wither in three months.

394
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:30,693
The farmers also said,

395
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:34,489
"It's better to keep a wonderful past."

396
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:35,782
When I heard them say that,

397
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:38,743
I suddenly felt sad.

398
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,747
That was when I thought of you.

399
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:49,261
I don't think I want to
end it in three months with you.

400
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,803
It just so happens that it's also three months?

401
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:58,562
You're bluffing, right?

402
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:06,104
Yes, I'm bluffing.

403
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:08,530
The gist is...

404
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,743
I miss you.

405
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:21,710
You blabbered on and on...

406
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:25,172
But the summary was way more romantic.

407
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:43,019
So, do you agree?

408
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:50,606
When you promised it'll last
more than three months...

409
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:52,975
you didn't mean just four months, right?

410
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:59,282
When you turn 40,

411
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:01,826
I'll still celebrate your birthday with you.

412
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:05,246
Happy birthday to you.

413
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:06,622
What?

414
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:07,999
Louder, I can't hear you.

415
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:11,085
Happy birthday to you.

416
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:13,387
Happy birthday!

417
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,090
When you turn 50,

418
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,842
I'll still celebrate your birthday with you.

419
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:20,560
Happy birthday!

420
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:23,944
I've blown out the candles.

421
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:26,984
Can I make a wish now?

422
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:31,488
What do you want to wish for?

423
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:40,580
Can I stick my tongue in?

424
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:27,335
Xiao Qi, you're so pretty today.

425
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:30,080
Thank you.

426
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,344
But you'll look prettier if you smile.

427
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:40,012
I'll smile later.

428
00:38:16,088 --> 00:38:18,629
What is it that needs to be said in person?

429
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:17,094
If the debts can be paid off,

430
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:21,992
will you stay and turn your life
upside-down with me?

431
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:46,558
I'm pregnant.

432
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:51,855
It's your child.

433
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:19,375
Xiao Qi, we...

434
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:48,049
Let's go.

435
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:13,645
This is the best solution
I've come up with so far.

436
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:17,057
Is this another form of revenge?

437
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:19,143
After I marry him,
he'll give me a sum of money.

438
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:20,853
It can temporarily pay off your debts.

439
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:23,905
You won't have to leave. You can stay.

440
00:41:24,735 --> 00:41:26,328
Stay?

441
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:30,070
The marriage is just a show.

442
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:33,257
Once your debts are paid off,
I'll take our child and leave him.

443
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,838
Your idea is too naive.

444
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:44,050
It's not an idea.

445
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:47,132
It's what I've decided.

446
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:55,312
Do you like it when I'm so naive?

447
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:07,216
I've never been a choice to you, have I?

448
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:11,499
This is the best decision for everyone.

449
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:30,024
Fine, Old Wu can give a speech.

450
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:34,111
But even Chairman Fu
and Chairman Kang wanted air time.

451
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:36,204
They never have anything interesting to say.

452
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:48,125
What's wrong? Are you tired?

453
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:50,711
Of course, I've been smiling all day.

454
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:52,921
It's only one day of exhaustion.

455
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:53,964
From now on,

456
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:57,384
you can just relax and be the chairman's wife.

457
00:43:57,384 --> 00:44:01,187
And have a healthy baby.

458
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:05,559
By the way, I've appointed a driver for you.

459
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:08,437
You're pregnant now. Don't drive.

460
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:11,357
But my job requires me to travel.
That'll be inconvenient.

461
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:13,859
Your status is different now.

462
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:16,737
Driving that small car around?

463
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:20,040
What would others say about me?

464
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:30,209
The will and the transfer of trust

465
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:32,503
has been amended as per your instructions.

466
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:34,554
Please take a look.

467
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:39,350
If there are no issues, please sign it.

468
00:44:43,976 --> 00:44:52,918
[Zhan Qian Ren]

469
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:58,195
Thank you, Attorney Ren.

470
00:44:58,195 --> 00:44:59,528
It's my pleasure.

471
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:11,854
Are you going out?

472
00:45:11,854 --> 00:45:13,836
To a consultation.

473
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:15,655
Haven't you been sleeping better lately?

474
00:45:15,655 --> 00:45:16,964
You still have sessions?

475
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:19,842
I'll feel better if I talk to the doctor.

476
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:21,802
I'm glad it helps.

477
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:24,805
Your mood is most important now.

478
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:26,473
Ask the driver to take you.

479
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:28,650
- I'll get going then.
- Okay.

480
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:01,975
Qian Ren got me a driver.

481
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:08,188
I think he wants to
keep an eye on us. Be careful.

482
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:16,364
I don't know how long this will last.

483
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:20,076
Yeah.

484
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:26,916
The baby kicked me.

485
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:30,454
That's too soon.

486
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:31,933
The baby's really kicking me.

487
00:46:31,933 --> 00:46:33,582
Feel it if you don't believe me.

488
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:35,008
Here.

489
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:37,377
Do you feel it?

490
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:40,047
Here. Do you feel it?

491
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:42,089
You must've eaten too much ice cream.

492
00:46:42,089 --> 00:46:43,759
Your stomach is bloated.

493
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:45,928
- It's rumbling.
- The baby really kicked me.

494
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:47,346
Why don't you believe me?

495
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:49,731
Yes, I feel it.

496
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:17,626
Why are you here?

497
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:19,927
Mr. Zhan asked me to...

498
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:22,798
You forgot your phone.

499
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:24,474
Thank you.

500
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:29,805
Hello, Dr. Gu. I'm a fan of yours.

501
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:31,496
I've read all your books.

502
00:47:31,496 --> 00:47:33,225
They encouraged me greatly.

503
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:34,476
Thank you.

504
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:36,728
Make an appointment with the receptionist
for our next session.

505
00:47:36,728 --> 00:47:38,138
Okay.

506
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:45,745
Why are you here?

507
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:48,740
Mr. Zhan said to change the family registry.

508
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:51,034
We need your ID and seal.

509
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:52,369
I asked the driver and he said you were here.

510
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:53,495
- That's why I'm here.
- Ask me directly next time.

511
00:47:53,495 --> 00:47:55,303
Don't ask the driver.

512
00:49:36,848 --> 00:49:38,850
Who let you take Shu Juan's stuff?

513
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:42,570
I...

514
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:47,784
Zhan Qian Ren!
