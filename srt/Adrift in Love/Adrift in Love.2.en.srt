[Tony]

00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,759
How's it going, Tony? You miss me?

3
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:12,939
My dear Yi Fu, are you coming today?

4
00:00:12,939 --> 00:00:14,247
I can't, I have plans.

5
00:00:14,247 --> 00:00:16,141
Damn, which girl is it today?

6
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:19,711
It's the 87th blind date
arranged by Ms. Qian Li Hua.

7
00:00:19,711 --> 00:00:22,981
Wow, your mom really won't give up.

8
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:24,733
Why are you so obedient this time?

9
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:26,359
I dare you to miss it.

10
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:27,969
I don't have the guts for that now.

11
00:00:27,969 --> 00:00:31,039
This time, it's Lin Feng Hua,
my mom's top pick for a daughter-in-law.

12
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,029
My mom will kill me if I don't appear.

13
00:00:33,029 --> 00:00:35,128
[Evil Lord aka Tony]

14
00:00:36,895 --> 00:00:39,256
- Hello?
- Xin Yi Fu, are you there yet?

15
00:00:39,256 --> 00:00:41,066
I'm almost there.

16
00:00:41,066 --> 00:00:42,751
Why aren't you there yet?

17
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:45,045
I finally arranged a date
with Mr. Lin's daughter.

18
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,513
How dare you be late?

19
00:00:46,513 --> 00:00:49,848
Would it kill her if she waited a little?

20
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:52,927
Are you chickening out again?

21
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:55,188
I didn't mean to.

22
00:00:55,188 --> 00:00:57,031
If you keep annoying me, I'll...

23
00:00:58,748 --> 00:01:00,335
Hello?

24
00:01:00,335 --> 00:01:01,915
Hey!

25
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,498
Fuck!

26
00:01:19,513 --> 00:01:22,363
What the hell?

27
00:01:23,567 --> 00:01:26,820
Miss, are you all right?

28
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:27,921
Hey.

29
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,422
I didn't hit you just now.

30
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:30,455
There's still some space here.

31
00:01:30,455 --> 00:01:32,242
I didn't hit you.

32
00:01:32,242 --> 00:01:33,618
Are you okay?

33
00:01:33,618 --> 00:01:35,364
What are you doing?

34
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:18,002
[Episode 2: Passion is the Most Honest Love?]

35
00:02:19,096 --> 00:02:22,122
Congratulations to Mr. Fan Yue Jiao
for winning the bid.

36
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:26,458
Let's welcome Mr. Fan
to the stage to say a few words.

37
00:02:31,793 --> 00:02:33,536
Thank you for your kindness,
General Manager Fan.

38
00:02:33,536 --> 00:02:35,597
I'm sure everyone is curious.

39
00:02:35,597 --> 00:02:37,489
Why are you so insistent on this auction item?

40
00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:39,017
Why do you like it so much?

41
00:02:39,017 --> 00:02:42,328
Can you share your joy with everyone?

42
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:46,680
Actually, Dr. Gu was the one

43
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,740
who asked me to do this.

44
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,782
He told me to keep a low profile.

45
00:02:53,782 --> 00:02:56,180
But I really can't help

46
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:59,820
but want to share this joy with everyone.

47
00:03:00,905 --> 00:03:02,749
Dr. Gu.

48
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:06,903
Thank you for getting me this ring.

49
00:03:06,903 --> 00:03:09,998
It's our engagement gift.

50
00:03:09,998 --> 00:03:11,399
Congratulations.

51
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:14,719
Congratulations, General Manager Fan.

52
00:03:16,313 --> 00:03:19,449
Thank you again
for your kindness, General Manager Fan.

53
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:23,244
Engagement? When did that happen?

54
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:25,338
We've been dating for six years.

55
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:28,089
What else will be our next step?

56
00:03:29,893 --> 00:03:33,505
Do you know our health center is losing money?

57
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:37,909
I don't have money for you
to do charity or buy such a diamond ring.

58
00:03:37,909 --> 00:03:42,555
That's why we need to be generous
and make people think we're rich.

59
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:44,724
Then someone will invest in us.

60
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,542
Trust me, someone will take the bait.

61
00:03:46,542 --> 00:03:49,422
Do you think everyone is stupid?

62
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:53,539
And why didn't you discuss it with me first?

63
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:58,116
If I had told you first, would you have agreed?

64
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:04,192
I'll be careful next time.

65
00:04:04,192 --> 00:04:05,898
Forgive me.

66
00:04:06,688 --> 00:04:08,307
Let's go.

67
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,294
You should go back first.

68
00:04:19,033 --> 00:04:21,101
I want to take a walk alone.

69
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:42,887
I'm not going back with you.

70
00:04:42,887 --> 00:04:44,742
I'm going to meet my friend.

71
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:46,828
Don't stay out too late.

72
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:48,713
And...

73
00:04:48,713 --> 00:04:51,138
Stop drinking.

74
00:04:51,941 --> 00:04:53,625
Okay.

75
00:05:27,602 --> 00:05:29,773
Are you following me?

76
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,324
I'm going to the gallery ahead.

77
00:05:35,324 --> 00:05:37,165
Do you want to come?

78
00:07:58,161 --> 00:07:59,479
Let me help you to the bench.

79
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,646
Don't help me.

80
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,049
- Take it easy.
- I can fly.

81
00:08:02,049 --> 00:08:03,317
Okay, you can fly.

82
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:05,378
Sit down and rest for a bit.

83
00:08:06,544 --> 00:08:08,221
Sit down.

84
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:10,220
Miss, your pouch.

85
00:08:12,642 --> 00:08:14,520
Take off!

86
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:19,129
Miss, where are you going? Miss!

87
00:08:20,683 --> 00:08:22,710
You've had too much to drink.

88
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,154
Hey!

89
00:08:27,482 --> 00:08:30,618
Okay, sit here first. Sit down.

90
00:08:30,618 --> 00:08:32,186
Hey, Miss!

91
00:08:47,698 --> 00:08:48,741
Hello?

92
00:08:48,741 --> 00:08:51,639
I'm on my way.

93
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:54,553
Miss!

94
00:08:54,553 --> 00:08:55,520
Let's go.

95
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,292
If you keep checking up on me
while I'm on a blind date,

96
00:08:57,292 --> 00:08:58,156
I'll be taken as a Mommy's boy.

97
00:08:58,156 --> 00:08:59,648
Our house is right ahead. Let's go.

98
00:08:59,648 --> 00:09:00,815
- Okay, bye.
- Who is it?

99
00:09:00,815 --> 00:09:02,512
It's nothing. Let's go.

100
00:09:02,512 --> 00:09:03,785
Come on. Taxi!

101
00:09:03,785 --> 00:09:05,522
Don't touch me!

102
00:09:05,522 --> 00:09:07,014
- Don't be like this!
- Sir!

103
00:09:07,014 --> 00:09:07,909
- Sir!
- Go away!

104
00:09:07,909 --> 00:09:09,465
Wait, excuse me.

105
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:10,883
- Do you know her?
- She's my friend.

106
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,453
She told you not to touch her.
Why did you touch her?

107
00:09:12,453 --> 00:09:14,053
No, she really is my friend.

108
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,011
I'll call the police now.

109
00:09:15,011 --> 00:09:17,974
- You can talk to them.
- Okay, chill.

110
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,150
It's okay.

111
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:21,814
Hello, 110?

112
00:09:33,217 --> 00:09:39,124
[Lin Feng Hua: 30 mins is my limit.
I gave you a chance, so bye!]

113
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,440
I'd better call the police for you.

114
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:08,534
Do you know what day it is today?

115
00:10:10,124 --> 00:10:12,080
It's Sunday.

116
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,583
Today is my...

117
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:23,997
30th birthday.

118
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:29,045
Oh, so what?

119
00:10:32,823 --> 00:10:35,526
No birthday cake.

120
00:10:36,536 --> 00:10:39,007
No one to celebrate it with.

121
00:10:40,957 --> 00:10:43,959
And I have to attend...

122
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:48,983
my damn ex-boyfriend's wedding
with his mistress.

123
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:54,280
That really sucks.

124
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,741
How about this?

125
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,728
Happy birthday.

126
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:12,463
Can you sing "Happy Birthday" to me?

127
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:14,819
Please?

128
00:11:28,588 --> 00:11:32,900
Happy birthday to you.

129
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:37,411
Happy birthday to you.

130
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:44,293
Where's the cake?

131
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:50,284
I already sang "Happy Birthday" to you,
and you still want a cake?

132
00:11:50,284 --> 00:11:52,739
Don't ask for too much.

133
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:03,219
Miss, you...

134
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,574
Hi.

135
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,203
Happy birthday to you.

136
00:12:24,203 --> 00:12:26,327
What the heck?

137
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:29,690
Didn't you want a cake?

138
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:31,817
These are candles, three candles.

139
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:33,402
Isn't it your 30th birthday?

140
00:12:33,402 --> 00:12:35,988
And this is the candlelight.

141
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:37,598
Don't you have any imagination?

142
00:12:37,598 --> 00:12:39,035
Look.

143
00:12:39,742 --> 00:12:43,871
Happy birthday to you.

144
00:12:43,871 --> 00:12:48,125
Happy birthday to you.

Happy birthday to you.

146
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:59,588
Happy birthday...

147
00:12:59,588 --> 00:13:01,295
to me.

148
00:13:11,114 --> 00:13:13,565
Come on, blow out the candles.

149
00:13:20,616 --> 00:13:23,101
I'll blow out the last one for you.

150
00:13:24,745 --> 00:13:26,570
Happy birthday.

151
00:13:40,428 --> 00:13:42,513
Do you want to sit on the bench?

152
00:14:25,673 --> 00:14:27,491
It stinks.

153
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:28,826
Stinks like hell.

154
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:30,160
Sour.

155
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,161
What do you think?

156
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:34,987
Did you skip the blind date
because you saved a hottie?

157
00:14:34,987 --> 00:14:36,292
It was crazy.

158
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:39,003
I've never met anyone so drunk
and with such stinky puke.

159
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,154
I shouldn't have saved her.

160
00:14:40,154 --> 00:14:41,190
Oh, come on.

161
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:42,411
You found an excuse to skip the blind date.

162
00:14:42,411 --> 00:14:44,466
Who saved who here, huh?

163
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:46,385
So what if I have a good excuse?

164
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:49,346
Ms. Qian Li Hua still won't
let me off the hook.

165
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:50,389
Fine.

166
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:53,058
Then break free from your mom.

167
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,044
You want to enjoy the perks
of being in a rich family,

168
00:14:55,044 --> 00:14:57,816
but also want to be uninhibited and free.

169
00:14:57,816 --> 00:14:59,942
Wow, it rhymes.

170
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:03,986
Mr. Xin, you can't have it all.

171
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:06,364
You're really bad at chatting.
No wonder you're single forever.

172
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:08,657
- Yi Fu.
- Single dog.

173
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:10,200
- Tina
- Hi.

174
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,120
- Hello.
- I'll leave you guys to chat.

175
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,040
Are you going to Rose's party tomorrow night?

176
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,691
Of course, why wouldn't I?

177
00:15:17,691 --> 00:15:19,897
I'll send you the address then.

178
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:25,710

179
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:28,506
Oh, right. I almost forgot.

180
00:15:30,961 --> 00:15:32,707
Okay, I've sent it to you.

181
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:48,138
Hello?

182
00:15:48,138 --> 00:15:50,199
Hello? Who is this?

183
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,201
Who are you?

184
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,436
You're the one who was
really drunk earlier, aren't you?

185
00:15:54,436 --> 00:15:57,024
This is my phone.
I think we switched phones by mistake.

186
00:15:57,024 --> 00:16:02,319
You scammers are really innovative,
but I'm broke!

187
00:16:02,319 --> 00:16:04,212
Hang on.

188
00:16:09,443 --> 00:16:11,220
I'm trying to sleep here!

189
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,052
Hey.

190
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:43,168
Why am I here?

191
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:46,028
Miss, did you black out?

192
00:16:47,531 --> 00:16:49,476
Drink this.

193
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,257
I'll sleep a bit more.

194
00:16:55,257 --> 00:16:57,838
Wake me up at seven.

195
00:17:04,873 --> 00:17:06,316
Breakfast is ready.

196
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:07,952
I'm not hungry.

197
00:17:07,952 --> 00:17:10,034
Come and sit down.

198
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:13,515
Why did you stand Lin Feng Hua up?

199
00:17:13,515 --> 00:17:17,074
Do you know how much effort
I put into setting this up?

200
00:17:17,074 --> 00:17:20,548
That's why we shouldn't look for trouble,

201
00:17:20,548 --> 00:17:22,091
or a princess to serve.

202
00:17:22,091 --> 00:17:24,863
Lin Feng Hua isn't a princess.

203
00:17:26,729 --> 00:17:29,863
She started a startup in the US.

204
00:17:29,863 --> 00:17:32,518
I heard it's doing really well.

205
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:34,530
Look at you.

206
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:40,032
She's much more capable than you.

207
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:45,725
That's right, everyone else is better.

208
00:17:45,725 --> 00:17:47,571
Your son is the worst.

209
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,345
You're just selling your son.

210
00:17:51,345 --> 00:17:53,430
What nonsense are you talking about?

211
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:56,033
Lin Feng Hua is capable
and has a good background.

212
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:58,435
What reason do you have to dislike her?

213
00:17:58,435 --> 00:18:00,479
I might like her.

214
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:03,123
But you can't order me to like her.

215
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:04,416
How about this?

216
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:08,837
Today, buy Lin Feng Hua a gift
and apologize.

217
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:12,308
And get to know her better.

218
00:18:12,308 --> 00:18:13,988
Okay.

219
00:18:14,943 --> 00:18:16,453
I'm so sleepy.

220
00:18:16,453 --> 00:18:17,746
Thank you for breakfast.

221
00:18:17,746 --> 00:18:19,431
I'm going to bed now.

222
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,558
Xin Yi Fu!

223
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:23,548
Xin Yi Fu!

224
00:18:27,715 --> 00:18:29,528
Still can't sleep well?

225
00:18:30,448 --> 00:18:33,032
I wouldn't be here if I could.

226
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:46,275
Today, let's talk about your past.

227
00:18:46,275 --> 00:18:48,343
Come on, I just need sleeping pills.

228
00:18:48,343 --> 00:18:51,278
You don't have to dig up my past.

229
00:19:09,623 --> 00:19:12,259
So, do you want to talk about the past?

230
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,013
Sure.

231
00:19:16,797 --> 00:19:19,224
My dad was an alcoholic.

232
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:22,911
He would beat my mom and me
when he got drunk.

233
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:24,997
When my dad died in a car accident,

234
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,999
my mom and I bought wine and celebrated.

235
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:36,809
After my dad died,
my mom kept dating new men.

236
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:38,863
She didn't work.

237
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:43,624
So, whenever a man left, we ran out of money.

238
00:19:43,624 --> 00:19:47,104
My mom couldn't take it anymore,
so she left, too.

239
00:19:47,104 --> 00:19:48,955
So, I became an unwanted orphan.

240
00:19:48,955 --> 00:19:50,829
That's why I'm sick.

241
00:19:52,633 --> 00:19:54,915
Is that what you want to hear?

242
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:58,554
And then?

243
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:02,478
You believe such a dramatic story?

244
00:20:02,478 --> 00:20:06,041
I believe there's a reason
behind everything a patient says.

245
00:20:10,651 --> 00:20:13,511
Then in high school, I had a crush on a senior.

246
00:20:15,697 --> 00:20:18,010
But he raped me.

247
00:20:28,032 --> 00:20:32,856
Do you want to talk about it? No pressure.

248
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:34,999
I don't feel pressured.

249
00:20:34,999 --> 00:20:37,053
Do you want the details?

250
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:42,157
I merely confessed to him.

251
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:45,085
But he passionately hugged me.

252
00:20:45,085 --> 00:20:48,017
He forcefully kissed my lips.

253
00:20:48,939 --> 00:20:51,770
He sucked my neck hard.

254
00:20:58,204 --> 00:21:00,337
And then...

255
00:21:06,081 --> 00:21:08,941
Do you want to hear more?

256
00:21:08,941 --> 00:21:11,319
You remember all the details.

257
00:21:12,829 --> 00:21:14,898
Do you think about it often?

258
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:16,784
Of course.

259
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,634
He grabbed my hair
and hit my head against the wall.

260
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,659
He took off my underwear.

261
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:31,103
Violently, over and over again,
he penetrated...

262
00:21:34,318 --> 00:21:36,137
I was in so much pain.

263
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:39,274
I was truly in so much pain.

264
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:59,691
How was it? Did I tell a good story?

265
00:22:01,303 --> 00:22:02,696
Was it fun?

266
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:04,728
It was so fun.

267
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:12,773
You psychiatrists have
an interesting profession.

268
00:22:12,773 --> 00:22:15,285
You get to hear a lot of patients' secrets.

269
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:18,387
If you don't trust me,

270
00:22:18,387 --> 00:22:20,481
why are you here today?

271
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:24,536
There must be something I need here.

272
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:32,036
Do you smoke?

273
00:22:32,882 --> 00:22:35,514
No. Why?

274
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:40,968
I'll prescribe you some medicine today.

275
00:22:40,968 --> 00:22:44,655
If you want to come again,
call and make an appointment.

276
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:46,323
You'll prescribe medicine for me today?

277
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:48,373
Yes.

278
00:22:48,373 --> 00:22:50,434
Are you giving up on me?

279
00:22:51,394 --> 00:22:54,254
It's always the patients
who give up on themselves.

280
00:23:07,361 --> 00:23:10,789
Take it 15 to 30 minutes before you go to bed.

281
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:12,267
If I have any questions for Dr. Gu...

282
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:14,245
The clinic's number is on the packet.

283
00:23:14,245 --> 00:23:16,466
You can call for consultation.

284
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:20,458
Thank you.

285
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:30,410
­

286
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:59,440
­

287
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:44,649
And here, it's this year's...

288
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:54,082
Your call will be forwarded.

289
00:25:00,724 --> 00:25:02,083
Where were we?

290
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:06,000
Please take a look at this year's
marketing budget plan, Vice President.

291
00:25:10,752 --> 00:25:12,518
What's wrong?

292
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,931
My phone got switched with someone else's.

293
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:17,157
Now it's off.

294
00:25:17,157 --> 00:25:19,495
Is he trying to steal my phone?

295
00:25:20,533 --> 00:25:21,903
Then you take his.

296
00:25:21,903 --> 00:25:25,090
His phone is newer than yours. You're lucky.

297
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:26,950
You're right.

298
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:29,638
No, I still have to find a way
to switch it back.

299
00:25:29,638 --> 00:25:31,454
He's probably more anxious than you are.

300
00:25:31,454 --> 00:25:33,862
Just wait for him to contact you.

301
00:25:35,911 --> 00:25:38,972
Mr. Zhan's girlfriend didn't like
the bracelet we picked out last time.

302
00:25:38,972 --> 00:25:40,132
She wants a refund.

303
00:25:40,132 --> 00:25:42,734
Can you go with her for me?

304
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:46,295
Here's the receipt.

305
00:25:51,051 --> 00:25:53,249
It's okay. Let's do it this way.

306
00:25:53,249 --> 00:25:54,325
Okay.

307
00:25:54,325 --> 00:25:57,722
We'll ask the chairman for his opinion.

308
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,967
Why ask the chairman?

309
00:25:59,967 --> 00:26:00,995
Because...

310
00:26:00,995 --> 00:26:03,186
Because the chairman has instructed us.

311
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:04,646
We have to consult him
about everything you do.

312
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:07,048
Fine, forget it. Ask him if you want.

313
00:26:07,048 --> 00:26:08,700
Get back to work.

314
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,740
- Let's go.
- Okay.

315
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,606
Hello.

316
00:26:22,606 --> 00:26:24,787
Hello, I'm looking for Miss Zhou Xiao Qi.

317
00:26:24,787 --> 00:26:26,253
Mr. Zhao asked me to come here.

318
00:26:26,253 --> 00:26:29,439
Miss Zhou is in the office.
Please wait a moment.

319
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:52,817
I only said a few words to Mr. Zhao
and she sent you here?

320
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:55,844
You're Miss Zhou?

321
00:26:58,892 --> 00:27:00,899
Do you have the receipt?

322
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:03,526
Yes.

323
00:27:05,515 --> 00:27:08,151
Miss, would you like
to consider another design?

324
00:27:08,151 --> 00:27:12,047
No, just proceed with a refund. Thank you.

325
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:13,883
The receipt.

326
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:23,963
Thank you.

327
00:27:29,422 --> 00:27:31,716
Is there a problem?

328
00:27:31,716 --> 00:27:34,627
Of course not. Please wait a moment.

329
00:27:49,693 --> 00:27:52,053
Speak your mind.

330
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:59,369
Ms. Zhou.

331
00:27:59,369 --> 00:28:02,141
This gift is from Mr. Zhan.

332
00:28:02,141 --> 00:28:04,249
Won't doing this hurt his feelings?

333
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:07,252
Is it better to pretend
to like something I don't?

334
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:11,464
But it's impolite to return
someone's gift for cash.

335
00:28:11,464 --> 00:28:13,283
It's mine if it's been given to me.

336
00:28:13,283 --> 00:28:16,747
Why do I have to consider others' feelings
when it's my possession?

337
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,891
Did you pick out that bracelet?

338
00:28:21,891 --> 00:28:23,725
Yes.

339
00:28:28,815 --> 00:28:32,883
Are you targeting me
because I reported you for shoplifting?

340
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:43,246
How can someone be so annoying?

341
00:28:43,246 --> 00:28:46,794
Just because she's the boss's girlfriend,
she's so arrogant.

342
00:28:47,667 --> 00:28:49,763
An eyeopener, right?

343
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,297
Chief Secretary.

344
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:55,550
Tell me, why are all rich people jerks?

345
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:58,027
Then do you want to be a rich jerk?

346
00:28:58,027 --> 00:29:01,018
- Of course.
- You've got your answer.

347
00:29:06,931 --> 00:29:09,509
Do you want to consider transferring here?

348
00:29:10,765 --> 00:29:12,484
Transferring here?

349
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:13,929
I'll recommend you to Mr. Zhan.

350
00:29:13,929 --> 00:29:19,065
It's not tiring, and the pay is better.

351
00:29:19,065 --> 00:29:20,492
A secretary?

352
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:21,993
But I specialize in marketing.

353
00:29:21,993 --> 00:29:24,996
Don't think secretaries only run errands.

354
00:29:24,996 --> 00:29:28,057
Working with the big boss
will increase your capabilities.

355
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:29,476
You'll have more opportunities.

356
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:32,670
Connections will help you in the future.

357
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:34,839
Don't be so ignorant.

358
00:29:38,153 --> 00:29:40,929
Okay, I'll think about it.

359
00:29:40,929 --> 00:29:42,546
I'll get to work.

360
00:29:56,633 --> 00:29:58,107
Hey.

361
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,360
­

362
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:29,996
You look so different from yesterday.

363
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:37,710
Happy birthday to you.

364
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:40,470
Happy birthday to you.

365
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:42,741
I'm sorry.

366
00:30:42,741 --> 00:30:45,452
I blacked out yesterday, so I needed to recall.

367
00:30:45,452 --> 00:30:48,373
You blacked out yesterday
and don't remember anything?

368
00:30:48,373 --> 00:30:50,380
You made me so miserable.

369
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,547
It's my loss.

370
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,795
Thank you for yesterday.

371
00:30:55,795 --> 00:30:59,407
The police said you saved me
from being taken advantage of.

372
00:30:59,407 --> 00:31:01,718
I'll treat you to a meal sometime.

373
00:31:01,718 --> 00:31:03,219
Sometime? People just say that.

374
00:31:03,219 --> 00:31:04,804
No, I have to go to work later.

375
00:31:04,804 --> 00:31:06,694
We can just switch our phones back.

376
00:31:29,787 --> 00:31:32,231
Then that's that.

377
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:35,988
Yeah, what else can we do?

378
00:31:36,786 --> 00:31:38,988
Nothing. Thank you.

379
00:31:38,988 --> 00:31:40,518
Bye.

380
00:31:50,644 --> 00:31:52,311
- Hello, do you have a reservation?
- Yes.

381
00:31:52,311 --> 00:31:54,788
- What's your name?
- Gu.

382
00:31:54,788 --> 00:31:55,880
Mr. Gu.

383
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,082
This way, please.

384
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:07,242
Sparkling or mineral water?

385
00:32:07,242 --> 00:32:10,104
- Mineral water.
- Okay, please wait.

386
00:32:16,378 --> 00:32:19,535
Dr. Gu, what a coincidence.

387
00:32:19,535 --> 00:32:21,914
Are you waiting for someone?

388
00:32:21,914 --> 00:32:23,481
Yes.

389
00:32:24,843 --> 00:32:27,470
Do you mind if I sit for a while?

390
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:31,530
I'm sorry, but I don't
usually eat with my patients.

391
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:33,074
Oh.

392
00:32:48,783 --> 00:32:50,727
Why is she here?

393
00:32:53,098 --> 00:32:55,494
Hello, here is your water.

394
00:32:56,457 --> 00:32:58,025
Thank you.

395
00:32:59,085 --> 00:33:00,686
Enjoy.

396
00:33:07,122 --> 00:33:10,152
I made the capital increase proposal.

397
00:33:25,111 --> 00:33:27,879
Our sales aren't even this good.

398
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:32,140
Didn't I tell you before?

399
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:34,287
This is fraud.

400
00:33:34,287 --> 00:33:36,163
It's not that serious.

401
00:33:36,163 --> 00:33:37,957
How is it fraud?

402
00:33:37,957 --> 00:33:40,568
Our sales will definitely get better.

403
00:33:40,568 --> 00:33:44,258
Those investors will be thrilled.

404
00:33:44,258 --> 00:33:47,273
Really, trust me.

405
00:33:50,135 --> 00:33:52,279
Don't be so anxious.

406
00:34:02,192 --> 00:34:04,209
- Perfect.
- Okay.

407
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:06,585
Yeah, I think that's it.
Ditch those annoying chords.

408
00:34:06,585 --> 00:34:08,253
- Got it.
- You're overthinking it.

409
00:34:08,253 --> 00:34:10,823
- Okay? That's it.
- Okay.

410
00:34:13,557 --> 00:34:18,767
Manager, can I work two more hours a day?

411
00:34:18,767 --> 00:34:21,584
You think this is a KTV where you can
add hours as you please?

412
00:34:21,584 --> 00:34:23,577
Don't you have a full-time job?

413
00:34:23,577 --> 00:34:25,688
- You'll burn out!
- No, I won't.

414
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:27,099
Stop fooling around.

415
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:29,573
- Hey, Tony.
- Yi Fu.

416
00:34:34,054 --> 00:34:35,983
What are you doing here?

417
00:34:37,216 --> 00:34:39,451
I work here.

418
00:34:39,451 --> 00:34:41,370
Do you come here often?

419
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:43,522
He's the boss here.

420
00:34:43,522 --> 00:34:45,482
You two know each other?

421
00:34:45,482 --> 00:34:47,983
- Yes.
- Not really.

422
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:53,532
Hello, sir.

423
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:58,329
♪ Listen to my confusion ♪

424
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:01,807
♪ Fill the hole in my heart ♪

425
00:35:01,807 --> 00:35:08,522
♪ Breaking my curse ♪

426
00:35:08,522 --> 00:35:09,773
♪ About you and... ♪

427
00:35:09,773 --> 00:35:11,890
You know this song?

428
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:14,470
It's my favorite band.

429
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:16,071
You like Sunset Sea, too?

430
00:35:16,071 --> 00:35:17,429
I love them!

431
00:35:17,429 --> 00:35:19,700
I work here because of them.

432
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:23,395
It's awesome to make money
while listening to them sing.

433
00:35:23,395 --> 00:35:25,456
They're so unpopular.

434
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:26,565
Why do you like them?

435
00:35:26,565 --> 00:35:29,652
I like what I like.
Who cares if they're unpopular?

436
00:35:29,652 --> 00:35:31,670
I'm just weird, I guess.

437
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:33,255
But Tony gets me.

438
00:35:33,255 --> 00:35:35,119
I can't believe he invited them to sing.

439
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:39,403
Tony? Impossible, he has such bad taste.

440
00:35:39,403 --> 00:35:40,929
I picked them.

441
00:35:40,929 --> 00:35:42,848
You're a Sea fan?

442
00:35:42,848 --> 00:35:44,349
I rarely meet like-minded people.

443
00:35:44,349 --> 00:35:46,101
When I mention them, no one ever gets it.

444
00:35:46,101 --> 00:35:47,548
Are you free this Friday?

445
00:35:47,548 --> 00:35:48,792
They're performing here.

446
00:35:48,792 --> 00:35:50,513
Want to watch them together?

447
00:35:51,969 --> 00:35:54,176
Darn it.

448
00:35:54,176 --> 00:35:56,303
Their songs are not my style at all.

449
00:35:56,303 --> 00:35:58,222
I can't imagine anyone liking their songs.

450
00:35:58,222 --> 00:36:00,491
And two of them at once.

451
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:02,351
You have no taste.

452
00:36:02,351 --> 00:36:04,068
Table four.

453
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:12,836
What?

454
00:36:12,836 --> 00:36:14,431
Don't flirt with the staff.

455
00:36:14,431 --> 00:36:15,409
It's a pain to find new hires.

456
00:36:15,409 --> 00:36:19,172
I know. I'm not stupid enough
to ask for trouble.

457
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:21,620
­

458
00:36:53,585 --> 00:36:55,112
You don't have an umbrella?

459
00:36:55,112 --> 00:36:57,656
Take my car. I'll give you a ride.

460
00:36:57,656 --> 00:37:00,300
It's okay. The bus stop is nearby.

461
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:04,502
You'll get soaked if you walk
to the bus stop in this heavy rain.

462
00:37:04,502 --> 00:37:07,149
It should stop soon, right?

463
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,448
Didn't you say you'd treat me to a meal?

464
00:37:11,448 --> 00:37:13,108
Let's do it today.

465
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,809
You look like you haven't
had spicy hot pot in ages.

466
00:37:33,809 --> 00:37:35,961
I really haven't had it for a long time.

467
00:37:35,961 --> 00:37:37,880
It's hard to eat it alone.

468
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:41,700
And it's weird to eat alone.

469
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,635
You can call a friend.

470
00:37:43,635 --> 00:37:46,205
I've been busy with work these past few years.

471
00:37:46,205 --> 00:37:48,916
Besides, you can't just
ask a friend out anytime.

472
00:37:48,916 --> 00:37:53,031
If you ever want to eat this, you can call me.

473
00:37:54,358 --> 00:37:55,940
- Here's your food.
- Thank you.

474
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,375
- I'll do it.
- Thank you.

475
00:38:00,669 --> 00:38:01,987
Wait.

476
00:38:01,987 --> 00:38:04,198
You're not going to dump
the whole plate of meat in, are you?

477
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:05,557
No way.

478
00:38:05,557 --> 00:38:07,600
That's a capital offense.

479
00:38:10,909 --> 00:38:12,462
You first.

480
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:25,119
Oh, good. You know your food.

481
00:38:27,099 --> 00:38:29,556
If you want anything else, it's on me.

482
00:38:29,556 --> 00:38:32,601
No, it's my treat today.

483
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:35,395
An employee treating the boss
to a meal? That's embarrassing.

484
00:38:35,395 --> 00:38:37,439
Although I'm your employee,

485
00:38:37,439 --> 00:38:39,636
I'm not so poor that I can't treat you to this.

486
00:38:39,636 --> 00:38:41,054
I said I'd treat you.

487
00:38:41,054 --> 00:38:43,495
Why are you so naggy?

488
00:38:44,696 --> 00:38:46,807
Then I'll treat you next time.

489
00:38:46,807 --> 00:38:48,458
Okay.

490
00:39:12,182 --> 00:39:14,918
You know eight seconds is the best time.

491
00:39:14,918 --> 00:39:16,378
You don't talk when you're cooking.

492
00:39:16,378 --> 00:39:19,840
Of course. If I talk,
I get distracted and forget.

493
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,509
But Tony always blabbers when he's cooking.

494
00:39:22,509 --> 00:39:24,486
He overcooks the fried dough.

495
00:39:24,486 --> 00:39:25,595
A capital offense.

496
00:39:25,595 --> 00:39:27,767
Unforgivable.

497
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:37,439
Has your sleep improved?

498
00:39:39,067 --> 00:39:40,514
Yes.

499
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,494
I dreamt of you last night.

500
00:39:44,847 --> 00:39:46,508
You dreamt of me?

501
00:39:49,547 --> 00:39:52,764
I dreamt that we were walking down the street.

502
00:39:53,332 --> 00:39:57,008
Then we entered a motel in tandem.

503
00:39:57,995 --> 00:40:00,614
Once we entered the room,

504
00:40:00,814 --> 00:40:03,980
we couldn't wait to have each other.

505
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:07,154
You tore open my dress.

506
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:09,865
I took off your shirt.

507
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:12,556
I saw that you had a perfect six-pack.

508
00:40:13,936 --> 00:40:16,762
Then you caressed me passionately.

509
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:20,442
We made love like crazy.

510
00:40:20,442 --> 00:40:26,056
In my dream, you had a mole there.

511
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:28,027
Do you really have one?

512
00:40:33,959 --> 00:40:36,833
Ms. Zhou, I'll get straight to the point.

513
00:40:36,833 --> 00:40:40,654
During our last two sessions,
you've had some rather...

514
00:40:40,654 --> 00:40:43,513
explicit conversations with me.

515
00:40:45,083 --> 00:40:50,480
Are you trying to provoke me, or...

516
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:58,001
I think...

517
00:40:58,727 --> 00:41:01,412
it's more like seduction.

518
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:05,172
What do you think?

519
00:41:06,546 --> 00:41:08,760
You're the professional.

520
00:41:24,122 --> 00:41:26,108
Ms. Zhou.

521
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:28,777
If you can't stop this behavior,

522
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:34,266
I'm sorry, but I can't continue counseling you.

523
00:41:34,266 --> 00:41:36,209
Why's that?

524
00:41:37,936 --> 00:41:40,502
Is it because you have feelings for me?

525
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:46,992
If you're worried about your own desires,

526
00:41:47,754 --> 00:41:50,998
from now on, I'm not your patient.

527
00:42:51,864 --> 00:42:54,644
I saw someone share online the other day

528
00:42:54,644 --> 00:42:58,468
that this juice combination
is very detoxifying.

529
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:46,106
What are you working on?

530
00:43:46,106 --> 00:43:48,542
I'm drafting a retraction.

531
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:49,626
What's it for?

532
00:43:49,626 --> 00:43:52,212
Your previous capital increase plan.

533
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:53,922
Why don't you believe me?

534
00:43:53,922 --> 00:43:56,283
Didn't I tell you this wouldn't work?

535
00:43:56,283 --> 00:43:57,420
Why not?

536
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:58,843
It'll be true once we make money.

537
00:43:58,843 --> 00:44:02,305
Once we make money,
it'll be considered fraud, you know?

538
00:44:02,305 --> 00:44:03,598
Please believe me.

539
00:44:03,598 --> 00:44:05,850
I believe that when it comes
to the capital increase plan,

540
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:08,186
you're clueless and don't understand.

541
00:44:08,186 --> 00:44:09,271
You don't know how to increase capital.

542
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:10,438
I don't know?

543
00:44:10,438 --> 00:44:12,689
Yes, because I'm just a masseuse.

544
00:44:12,689 --> 00:44:13,733
I don't know anything.

545
00:44:13,733 --> 00:44:15,277
Do you think I ever cared about this?

546
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:17,279
How can you not care?
Your actions show that you care.

547
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:19,406
You don't believe in anything.

548
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:21,741
I'm trying so hard to learn everything,

549
00:44:21,741 --> 00:44:25,036
so that I can be worthy of being with you.

550
00:44:25,036 --> 00:44:26,188
Can't you feel it?

551
00:44:26,188 --> 00:44:28,248
Fan Yue Jiao, please stop with this insecurity!

552
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:30,542
I'm not insecure.

553
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:32,210
I'm trying so hard.

554
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:35,005
If I have an inferiority complex,
don't you think it's because of you?

555
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:37,340
I've been trying so hard to change everything.

556
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:39,134
Can you see it? Can you feel it?

557
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:40,635
Are you in pain?

558
00:44:40,635 --> 00:44:42,262
- I'm not in pain. I'm working hard.
- I'm in pain.

559
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:44,014
- I'm enjoying it.
- It pains me to see you like this.

560
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:45,625
Why are you in pain? I can change.

561
00:44:45,625 --> 00:44:48,659
Maybe we should have some time apart.

562
00:44:51,830 --> 00:44:53,452
Time apart?

563
00:44:54,149 --> 00:44:55,734
Where are you going?

564
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:57,736
This is your home.
Where do you want me to go?

565
00:44:57,736 --> 00:44:59,405
- I think we need to calm down.
- Do you want to leave me?

566
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:00,190
We both need to calm down.

567
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:02,282
We can't reach a consensus on anything
when we communicate.

568
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:03,491
I know you don't love me.

569
00:45:03,491 --> 00:45:05,310
If you don't love me, just say it.

570
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:06,964
- You look down on me.
- We can't agree on anything.

571
00:45:06,964 --> 00:45:08,030
You don't love me anymore.

572
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:10,617
- All because I'm not worthy.
- We can't communicate well.

573
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,793
I understand.

574
00:45:13,793 --> 00:45:16,780
Fan Yue Jiao, you're useless.

575
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:18,007
- Please don't think like that.
- No matter how hard you try,

576
00:45:18,007 --> 00:45:20,884
you're useless. No one will love you.

577
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:22,202
Can we talk about the facts?

578
00:45:22,202 --> 00:45:24,305
- I'm telling you...
- You're not worthy.

579
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:26,389
No one will love you.

580
00:45:26,389 --> 00:45:27,936
I have to calm down. I have to calm down.

581
00:45:27,936 --> 00:45:29,056
I can't get angry. I have to calm down.

582
00:45:29,056 --> 00:45:31,402
I can't mess up.

583
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:37,999
Stop holding the knife. Put it down.

584
00:45:40,111 --> 00:45:42,598
Don't do this again.

585
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:50,528
Can you spare me, please?

586
00:45:59,439 --> 00:46:02,509
I'm sorry.

587
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:04,963
I'm sorry.

588
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:15,044
I'm sorry.

589
00:46:20,276 --> 00:46:22,919
I'm sorry.

590
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:02,226
Do you have a light?

591
00:50:24,988 --> 00:50:27,023
Aren't you going to return it?

592
00:50:27,023 --> 00:50:29,886
Now, you'll think of me when you smoke.
