1
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:23,088
Why didn't you go to the hospital?

2
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:38,312
Mr. Zhang next door is reading your book.

3
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:41,690
He knows you're my son.

4
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:44,401
He wants your autograph.

5
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:53,970
You broke up with Yue Jiao?

6
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:58,058
A few days ago, she called me out of the blue.

7
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:01,603
She told me she couldn't come.

8
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:03,837
She told me to take care of myself.

9
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:10,236
You can't force love.

10
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:12,420
There's nothing wrong with not loving.

11
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,890
If there's nothing wrong,
why didn't you tell Mom yourself?

12
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,523
Love can't be forced.

13
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,063
That's right.

14
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,566
You've never forced yourself to do anything.

15
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:28,696
It's because you can't control yourself.

16
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:33,343
The one who's not loved should let go.

17
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:34,994
Right?

18
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:39,724
That's why you forced my mom
to jump off the building.

19
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:43,043
I wish you were the one who jumped that day.

20
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:53,113
I've hated you all my life.

21
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,931
In the end, I became you.

22
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,351
As long as there's no love,

23
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:03,206
the damage is already done.

24
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,451
It's no one's fault.

25
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:09,337
I don't want you to end up like me,

26
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:12,489
punishing yourself with a lifetime of pain.

27
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:15,534
Hurting you two

28
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:20,972
is the biggest regret of my life.

29
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:24,526
We made the same mistake.

30
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:29,539
How could you expect us
to have a different ending?

31
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:32,986
Gu Jia Xin.

32
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,238
Look at yourself.

33
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,567
You are my future.

34
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:41,244
I'm sorry.

35
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,151
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:53,436
I forgive you.

37
00:02:58,261 --> 00:02:59,690

[Reconciliation with the Self]

39

Only by creating a better future

40
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:12,132
can we truly make up for past regrets.

41
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:16,136
Do you remember your own words?

42
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:20,015
Your job is to give strength to others.

43
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:26,022

Hello, do you need help?

00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:31,813
Hello.

47
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:32,897
Here's the thing.

48
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:35,066
A few months ago, I sold you a wedding dress.

49
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:38,569
I'd like to ask if I can buy it back.

50
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:40,822
The styles from a few months ago

51
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:43,408
are probably all out of stock.

52
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:46,828
The wedding dress you want
is no longer in the shop.

53
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:48,538
Would you like to look at other dresses?

54
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,707
We have many new designs.

55
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,691
No, thank you.

56
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:57,779
It's fine. Let's go back to the previous shop.

57
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:03,886
Excuse me, I'd like to know
where the discarded gowns go.

58
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:06,806
Well, let me check for you, okay?

59
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,582
Thank you.

60
00:05:18,524 --> 00:05:19,694
Forget it.

61
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:23,156
Even if you find it here,
you wouldn't want to wear it.

62
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,140
Why wouldn't I wear it if I find it?

63
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:33,374
Feel free to look around.
Prices are negotiable.

64
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:35,692
Ma'am, I have a question.

65
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,421
Is this wedding dress still in your shop?

66
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:39,922
It was sold by OURS.

67
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:41,924
This one?

68
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:43,258
We have so many wedding dresses.

69
00:05:43,258 --> 00:05:45,428
I'm not sure if it's still here.

70
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,764
How about you buy this one? Look.

71
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,891
This floral one and this one.

72
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,518
This is the latest one.

73
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,770
I'm sorry, but can I look for it?

74
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,939
Sure, take your time.

75
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:57,756
Thank you.

76
00:06:03,751 --> 00:06:07,362
Forget it. How are you going to find it
when there are so many?

77
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,692
It'll take you forever to find it.

78
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:23,966
I really don't understand
what you're so insistent about.

79
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:26,010
Why do you have to find that wedding dress?

80
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,513
If you think it's meaningless
and don't want to look, that's fine.

81
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,414
You can go home first.

82
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:32,580
No.

83
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,245
Just let her look for it.

84
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:55,331
If she can't find it,
she'll come back and choose.

85
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:56,541
Right?

86
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,875
Yes.

87
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:00,545
I really don't understand you two.

88
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:03,697

91
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:26,053
What's up? Are we going to Nepal for fun?

92
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,448
Fun? Are you crazy?

93
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,599
There was at least a kiss, right?

94
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,997
Damn, you really kissed?

95
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:38,875
Caught you in the act, huh. And then?

96
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,485
What do you mean? Nothing happened.

97
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,549
A girl like Lin Feng Hua
just threw herself at you,

98
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,867
and you could still hit the brakes.

99
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,620
You're really something.

100
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:55,057
But let me ask you this.

101
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:58,102
If you had met Lin Feng Hua before Xin Tong,

102
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:00,212
would you be with her?

103
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:05,985
Maybe.

104
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,761
Really?

105
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:11,598
Maybe she's more suitable
for you than Xin Tong.

106
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:18,015
Perhaps.

107
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:23,085
But you wouldn't break up
with Xin Tong over this, right?

108
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:26,363
Of course not. We're getting married.

109
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:32,887
So, according to you,

110
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:36,706
being responsible is more important
than being compatible?

111
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:02,667
Madam.

112
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:03,751
It's you again?

113
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,586
You really won't give up?

114
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:08,172
I'm sorry, but I want to keep looking.

115
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:10,800
You looked all day yesterday
and searched my entire shop.

116
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,301
If you couldn't find it,
it must have been sold.

117
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:14,345
No, maybe I didn't look carefully enough.

118
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:15,972
I'll just look for a bit. It'll be quick.

119
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,463
Thank you.

120
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:22,586
I really don't understand
why that dress is so important to you.

121
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,578
Miss.

122
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,121
Miss.

123
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,623
I remember now.

124
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,833
This dress was really sold.

125
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,918
Back then, a musical theater troupe...

126
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:29,170
Look.

127
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,421
They bought it as a costume.

128
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:32,798
They even asked us to help
put up posters for promotion.

129
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,443
Is this the one?

130
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:17,367
Why aren't you going up?

131
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,581
I'm spending time with my thoughts.

132
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,083
What are you thinking about?

133
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:36,177
Let's take a walk.

134
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:59,768
Have you thought about our future?

135
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:07,000
We can have two children.

136
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,980
If it's too tiring, we can just have one.

137
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:16,343
And then, we'll live happily ever after.

138
00:12:16,343 --> 00:12:18,880
Do you think this is a fairy tale?

139
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:22,408
Don't idol dramas always end here?

140
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,618
What else?

141
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,779
What kind of future do you envision?

142
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,329
I used to imagine many versions.

143
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:37,322
But lately, I can't see them as clearly.

144
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,762
I think you're just too tired
from planning the wedding.

145
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,346
Let's go.

146
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:46,891
Let's go home early.

147
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,583
Yi Fu.

148
00:12:55,249 --> 00:12:56,588
You have to try on wedding dresses tomorrow,

149
00:12:56,588 --> 00:12:58,611
and there are a lot of alterations.

150
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,387
We're pressed for time.

151
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:03,139
Xin Yi Fu.

152
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,728
Let's cancel the wedding.

153
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:13,125
Apologize to your mom for me.

154
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,232
I want to apologize to you, too.

155
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:23,535
Why?

156
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,539
Is it because you haven't found
the wedding dress you want?

157
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,795
From the moment I decided to get married,

158
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:37,340
everything went wrong.

159
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:41,362
I can tell my mom to stay out of it.

160
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:42,988
I'll let you decide everything.

161
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:46,057
- Is that okay?
- This isn't about your mom.

162
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,105
It's about me?

163
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,877
If I've done anything wrong, I can change.

164
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:58,879
You can tell me.

165
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:02,341
But it's not so serious that
we can't get married.

166
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:05,744
Do you really think we can be happy together?

167
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:15,980
I always thought love wouldn't change
as long as I tried hard enough.

168
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,536
But I didn't expect it to be me
who changed in the end.

169
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:37,025
So...

170
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,363
You don't love me anymore?

171
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,221
You said ending a relationship
at the best time is the most beautiful.

172
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:51,539
I realized you were right.

173
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,544
Love is so strange.

174
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:01,692
Passion comes out of nowhere,

175
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:04,543
but it leaves calmly and secretly.

176
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:19,275
- Let's...
- Let's say goodbye before love disappears.

177
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:26,282
Can we...

178
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:31,037
not break up?

179
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:41,538
Let's not lie to ourselves, all right?

180
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:46,678
I just said it before you did.

181
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:19,126
At least we made it through three months.

182
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,950
We successfully broke your jinx.

183
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,304
I guess I'm special and unique.

184
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,941
Thank you for giving me good memories.

185
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:40,051
Thank you for helping me love myself again.

186
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:30,490
We both tried.

187
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,836
We really tried.

188
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,979
You're closed today?

189
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,417
I'm tired.

190
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:08,324
I'm done. I want to rest.

191
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,081
Why the sudden decision?

192
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,080
Where can I find you in the future?

193
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:25,437
I just don't want you to find me.

194
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,034
Why not?

195
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,675
Why not?

196
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:36,723
You always come here and rant about your life.

197
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:41,227
I get stressed, too, Miss.

198
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:47,525
What's wrong with you? Are you drunk?

199
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,714
Stop drinking. Come on, I'll take you home.

200
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:53,799
Stop drinking.

201
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,219
I'm not done yet. Sit down.

202
00:18:55,219 --> 00:18:58,206
- I don't want to hear your drunk talk.
- Sit down.

203
00:19:02,392 --> 00:19:05,054
Okay, tell me what you want to say.

204
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,605
Every time you come here,

205
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:11,591
you try to seek comfort from me.

206
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:16,530
That's enough. It's been almost 20 years.

207
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,074
I think I've done enough.

208
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:22,535
I think this is enough for our fate.

209
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:29,251
If you're unhappy, I'll just be your customer.

210
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:31,044
I'll drink my soup and eat my noodles.

211
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:32,756
I won't bother you. Is that okay?

212
00:19:32,756 --> 00:19:34,915
It's not like that.

213
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:37,801
When I see you,

214
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:40,971
I care about you, I worry about you.

215
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:43,724
I wonder if you're happy, if you're joyful.

216
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:46,476
Will you get arrested by the police again?

217
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:48,604
I...

218
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,689
I don't want that.

219
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,901
I don't want to do that.

220
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:55,444
It's been over 20 years.
Why do you suddenly want to change?

221
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:58,030
Can't you continue to care about me?

222
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,115
Don't you know Gu Hou Ze just left me?

223
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:02,350
Are you going to ditch me?

224
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:07,688
Zhou Xiao Qi.

225
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:12,920
Yes, he left you, and I'm leaving you, too.

226
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,632
No one can stay with anyone forever.

227
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:19,426
It's the same for the baby in your tummy.

228
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:22,221
It'll stay with you for 10 to 20 years at most.

229
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,848
The child has to live their own life.

230
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:26,516
What about you?

231
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:29,144
Aren't you going to live your life
alone from now on?

232
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:31,796
Just like me.

233
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:36,526
You used to be so brave.

234
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:41,347
Love turned you into this.

235
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,854
Zhou Xiao Qi, I'll be serious.

236
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:53,043
No matter what difficulties
you face in the future,

237
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,253
remember this.

238
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,797
The way you plucked up your courage

239
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:59,675
and asked me for a bowl of noodles.

240
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:02,804
That Zhou Xiao Qi is invincible.

241
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:05,206
I don't want you like this.

242
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,340
The fish soup will be ready soon.

243
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:14,822
Coming right up. Fish soup.

244
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,750
Ma'am.

245
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:36,504
Can I have a bowl of noodles?

246
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:45,364
I haven't eaten for days.

247
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,866
There's no milk for the baby.

248
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:50,434
The baby has been starving.

249
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:55,248
Ma'am.

250
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:57,250
I can do anything for you.

251
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,293
Anything.

252
00:22:58,293 --> 00:23:01,588
Sweep, wash dishes, wash vegetables, mop.

253
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:04,977
I can do anything.
I'm not afraid of being tired, Ma'am.

254
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:11,973
Ma'am, give me a bowl of noodles.

255
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:14,333
I want to feed my baby.

256
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:30,659
Sis, I want miso soup, chicken,
and shredded bamboo shoots today.

257
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,663
- Okay.
- One order.

258
00:23:32,663 --> 00:23:33,872
Ma'am.

259
00:23:33,872 --> 00:23:35,789
Ma'am.

260
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:39,209
Shredded bamboo shoots, chicken, and miso soup.

261
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:41,694
Okay, coming.

262
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:47,592
You have a grandchild now?

263
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:50,011
So lucky.

264
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:52,246
Good girl.

265
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:57,093
Here, help yourself to the chicken.

266
00:24:04,403 --> 00:24:06,763
Here, be careful.

267
00:24:33,932 --> 00:24:35,666
How are you?

268
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:38,793
Not good.

269
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:44,232
I know.

270
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:46,526
It's even worse when I see you.

271
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:48,904
I thought I was pitiful enough.

272
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:52,117
I didn't expect myself to be
even more pitiful at 35.

273
00:24:52,117 --> 00:24:56,394
Adults say things will get better
in the future, but it's all a lie.

274
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:01,249
I'm sorry.

275
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:03,043
I've disappointed you.

276
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:05,962
Can you try harder to live a better life?

277
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:09,156
At least give me some hope for the future.

278
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:12,993
Otherwise, how can I go on?

279
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:17,039
I'm working hard.

280
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:20,852
You keep coming to see me.
How are you trying hard?

281
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:22,354
That's because I want to save you.

282
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:25,047
Can you save yourself first?

283
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:33,198
I want to.

284
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,367
But I don't know how.

285
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:38,436
I was braver than you when I was 17.

286
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:42,231
I hate you.

287
00:26:07,969 --> 00:26:09,067
Hou Ze.

288
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:15,031
By the time you get this letter,
I'll have left you.

289
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:16,616
Hou Ze.

290
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:20,328
I never thought I'd have to
say goodbye to you like this.

291
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:22,313
Hou Ze.

292
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:06,148
Can I make an appointment?

293
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:14,823
I'm almost done here.

294
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:19,510
I can't see patients anymore.

295
00:27:20,349 --> 00:27:22,583
I want to finish my story.

296
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:42,226
It's true that I was raped by the senior
I had a crush on in high school.

297
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,830
Are you Zhou Xiao Qi?

298
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:09,378
I heard you like me.

299
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:16,028
Come on.

300
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:31,543
What are you doing? Don't you like me?

301
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:34,421
- Don't you like me?
- Senior, no!

302
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:36,506
- I'm here.
- No!

303
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:38,633
I don't want to!

304
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:40,492
I don't want to!

305
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:45,306
Don't run!

306
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:46,641
Don't do this!

307
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:48,500
I don't want to!

308
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:03,491
From that moment on,

309
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:07,061
my fantasies and expectations
about love disappeared.

310
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:23,094
I didn't even have time to be afraid

311
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:25,412
when I found out I was pregnant.

312
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,916
At that time, I tried everything

313
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:32,252
to kill the baby in my womb.

314
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,799
I thought she ruined my life.

315
00:30:11,061 --> 00:30:13,353
But no matter how hard I tried,

316
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:15,462
I didn't succeed.

317
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:18,589
I guess it was fate.

318
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:23,112
So, I dropped out of school and had her.

319
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:25,681
Then I worked part-time to make money

320
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:29,443
to raise my daughter, Duo Duo.

321
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:35,816
I was only 17 at the time.

322
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:42,698
Girls my age were all worried
about dating and boyfriends.

323
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,456
I was the only one.

324
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:50,557
I was the only one worried that
my child wouldn't have enough to eat.

325
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:52,433
I was still a child, too.

326
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:55,043
Why did I have to suffer?

327
00:30:58,064 --> 00:31:01,025
I didn't even know what love was.

328
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:03,069
I had never been in love.

329
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:05,804
And I was never loved by my parents.

330
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:11,143
But on that day,

331
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:14,750
I looked at Duo Duo.

332
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:18,358
When she looked at me,

333
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:23,489
it was like I was her whole world.

334
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:28,535
I could feel her love running so deep.

335
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,348
That was when I realized that love

336
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:34,416
can make someone

337
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:37,044
so happy,

338
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:40,672
so content.

339
00:31:43,449 --> 00:31:45,925
I must have done a lot of
bad things in my past life.

340
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:54,144
The only love I ever felt

341
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:58,082
was taken away just like that.

342
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:00,859
Duo Duo.

343
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:06,990
Duo Duo.

344
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,122
Duo Duo.

345
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:20,921
Duo Duo.

346
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:37,521
Duo Duo.

347
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:45,338
Duo Duo.

348
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:47,548
Duo Duo.

349
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:49,283
Duo Duo.

350
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:02,563
That morning,

351
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:04,840
she was clearly smiling at me.

352
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:11,722
How could she just stop breathing?

353
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:21,273
After so many years,

354
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:25,861
I still can't forget that day.

355
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:34,762
Actually, I'm not here today

356
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:37,873
to ask for your forgiveness or sympathy.

357
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:42,537
I just want you to know

358
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:47,608
that besides Duo Duo,

359
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:49,936
you're the only one who made me feel love.

360
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,740
Thank you for helping me

361
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:58,852
move on from the cage of my 17-year-old self.

362
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:03,630
Thank you.

363
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:20,707
I'll send your medical records

364
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:23,502
to another doctor.

365
00:34:46,712 --> 00:34:49,030
I'm going to be a mom again.

366
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:58,912
Can I use this name?

367
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:03,917
You named her with a father's heart.

368
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,921
That love truly existed.

369
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:12,467
So, I want to give this name to my child.

370
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,637
Can I?

371
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:18,580
Why do that?

372
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:27,482
Thank you for loving me.

373
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:31,039
I was very happy.

374
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:34,114
Take care.

375
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:20,928
Xiao Qi.

376
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:22,579
Xiao Qi.

377
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:32,130
Let's get married.

378
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:11,205
Okay, you're not eating anymore?

379
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:13,522
No, I didn't get it.

380
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,781
Okay, come on.

381
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:27,847
Daddy, wake up.

382
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:29,915
Fei Fei, wake Daddy up.

383
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:36,421
The weather is so nice.

384
00:38:37,206 --> 00:38:41,158
Let's take Daddy for a walk
on the beach next time, okay?

385
00:38:41,158 --> 00:38:43,070
Let's wake Daddy up.

386
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:46,115
Daddy, wake up, lazybones!

387
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:48,391
Lazybones!

388
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:52,038
Do you want Mommy to read you a story?

389
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:53,519
All right.

390
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:56,125
Let's see.

391
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:58,919
It's your favorite.

392
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:01,130
Bunny, look.

393
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:04,991
Bunny's birthday. Happy birthday.

394
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:08,387
Turn the page.

395
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:11,682
Look. Bunny is sleeping, right?

396
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:13,642
And then, his parents

397
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:16,878
came to look for Bunny with a present.

398
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,398
Are you a bunny, too?

399
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:21,150
A bunny?

400
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,717
You are?

401
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:27,365
Yes, look, there's a present.

402
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:30,350
Mommy has a present for you, Bunny.

403
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,199
Pan Xin Tong.

404
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:48,552
Open the door.

405
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:50,287
Come in.

406
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:16,027
Sorry, the house is a mess. Have a seat.

407
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:20,629
I brought Fei Fei a present.

408
00:40:20,629 --> 00:40:25,548
You're finally back.

409
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:27,800
Congratulations on giving birth.

410
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,993
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

411
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:37,601
These are all toys for Fei Fei.

412
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:39,061
Thanks.

413
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:41,921
She has a lot of toys. Don't buy any more.

414
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:44,850
You were in Vietnam for a year.

415
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:47,427
It must have been tough, Vice President Pan.

416
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:51,198
It wasn't easy.

417
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:53,933
Can it be more tiring than being a mother?

418
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:59,707
How are you? Do you have a boyfriend?

419
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:01,208
Of course not.

420
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:03,777
I only focused on work.

421
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:06,508
Okay.

422
00:41:06,508 --> 00:41:10,134
You've accumulated
a lot of achievements in Vietnam.

423
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:13,304
Do you want to come back to
the Taipei headquarters as Vice President?

424
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:15,747
You can push the company to go public.

425
00:41:17,352 --> 00:41:20,102
I want to stay in Vietnam for a few more years.

426
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:21,562
I thought I wouldn't last three months.

427
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:24,482
I can't believe a year has passed.

428
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:28,635
Actually, I quite enjoy striving alone
in an unfamiliar environment.

429
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:34,182
All right.

430
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:41,022
How about you?

431
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:43,483
Are you okay?

432
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,378
I'm fine.

433
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:48,321
I have everything.

434
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:06,565
Miss, do you have a reservation?

435
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:07,983
No. Do you have a table for one?

436
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:10,343
Yes, we do. This way, please.

437
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:16,766
Please take a look at the menu.

438
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:25,334
Here's your meat.

439
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:27,026
Thank you.

440
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:51,110
All right.

441
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,612
You guys book a private room.
I'll go pay first.

442
00:42:52,612 --> 00:42:54,029
Okay, I'll book it.

443
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:55,489
Okay.

444
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:57,557
Let's see if there's anything nearby.

445
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:09,003
Long time no see.

446
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:10,713
Long time no see.

447
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:11,964
What a coincidence!

448
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:16,468
You can now eat spicy hot pot by yourself.

449
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:20,121
I later found out that eating it alone
is quite relaxing.

450
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:23,350
How about you? How have you been?

451
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:24,351
Good.

452
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:26,353
I've been assigned to the Vietnam branch.

453
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:28,355
I'm back for a few days.

454
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:30,524
Expat assignment? You got a promotion!

455
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:31,966
Yes.

456
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:35,428
How about you? How's work?

457
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,698
It's about the same.

458
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:39,700
I'm still at Snobis.

459
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,327
How's life?

460
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:44,622
Did you end up with Director Lin's daughter?

461
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,415
Lin Feng Hua?

462
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:48,626
We were a couple, but not anymore.

463
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,127
How come?

464
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:51,879
I thought she was a good match for you.

465
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:53,464
You know.

466
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:55,156
Three months.

467
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:57,301
Mr. Xin.

468
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:59,219
The private room is booked.
We'll wait for you downstairs.

469
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:00,596
Okay.

470
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:02,765
Well, that's all for now.
This hot pot is on me.

471
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:04,975
- You don't have to.
- Why not?

472
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:07,102
We haven't seen each other for over a year.

473
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:09,170
It's rare to run into you here.

474
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:13,817
Keep in touch.

475
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:16,469
Yes, let's keep in touch.

476
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:19,138
I'll pay first.
