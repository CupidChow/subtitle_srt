Do you want to hear them?

8
00:00:40,456 --> 00:00:42,458
You should play it safe first.

you gave him money willingly.

why not just say so?

83

92
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:57,773
No, I have no reason to take your money.

93
00:05:57,773 --> 00:05:59,817
I'm lending it to you, not giving it.

94
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:01,695
You can pay me back when you have the money.

95
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:05,281
Or I can deduct it from your salary.

96
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:07,494
I don't borrow money from others.

97
00:06:10,428 --> 00:06:12,955
Why are you so troublesome?

98
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:16,985
You were so fierce asking for money,
but now you don't want my help.

99
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:22,757
I don't need your help.
I'll figure something out myself.

100
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:24,511
Wait.

101
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:30,473
How about I give you another part-time job?

102
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,458
But it's a bit difficult.

103
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:35,087
I'll give you 100,000 if you complete it.

104
00:06:36,495 --> 00:06:39,481
What do you think? Want to earn some money?

105
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,193
I'm really sorry.

106
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:45,196
Feng Hua suddenly couldn't make it today.

107
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:48,366
Next time, I'll make sure
she apologizes to you in person.

108
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:50,076
It's okay.

109
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:53,079
We're both old,
but young people can't sit still.

110
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:56,207
There will be a next time.

111

Happy birthday.

119
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,476
I said no gifts, just your presence.

120
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:18,104
It's not a big gift, just a token.

121
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,381
Mr. Zhan, you're too kind.

122
00:07:20,381 --> 00:07:22,758
Director Qian, happy birthday.

123
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:26,030
This way, please.

124
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,417
Let's go.

125
00:07:43,187 --> 00:07:44,755
The food here is quite good.

126
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:46,425
Really?

127
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:49,120
Mr. Zhan, thank you for coming.

128
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:54,807
Sorry we're late.

Happy birthday.

131
00:08:00,579 --> 00:08:02,064
Let me introduce everyone.

132
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:05,054
This is my girlfriend, Pan Xin Tong.

133
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,574
What a surprise.

134
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:15,981
I didn't expect Yi Fu's girlfriend
to be an employee of Hongfa.

135
00:08:16,804 --> 00:08:18,831
Your name is Pan Xin Tong, right?

136
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,082
Yes, Mr. Zhan.

137
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:23,294
Chief Secretary Zhao speaks highly of you.

138
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,629
Yi Fu, you have good taste.

139
00:08:25,629 --> 00:08:29,158
Yes, Mr. Zhan. Xin Tong is a good catch.

140
00:08:29,158 --> 00:08:31,410
It took me a long time to win her over.

141
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:35,097
Pan Xin Tong, you're truly outstanding.

142
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:37,057
A handsome man and a beautiful woman.

143
00:08:37,057 --> 00:08:39,268
You're a good match, aren't you, Xiao Qi?

144
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:40,831
Being a match isn't the point.

145
00:08:40,831 --> 00:08:42,755
The point is liking each other.

146
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:44,256
Hmm.

147
00:08:45,207 --> 00:08:46,984
Is that so?

148
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:51,181
Then, Ms. Pan, what do you like about Yi Fu?

149
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:57,369
Mom, don't ask that question
in front of so many people.

150
00:08:57,369 --> 00:09:00,206
We're all family. What's wrong with that?

151
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:03,945
I think everyone would like to know.

152
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:10,051
I don't know either.

153
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:13,204
Maybe it's because
he likes spicy hotpot as much as I do.

154
00:09:13,204 --> 00:09:16,238
But he can't eat it alone.

155
00:09:16,238 --> 00:09:17,932
Maybe it's because he's just like me.

156
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:21,521
He goes crazy when he sees
fried dough fritters get mushy.

157
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:26,165
Actually, I didn't like him at first.

158
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:30,761
He acted like he was so handsome
that all girls would like him.

159
00:09:30,761 --> 00:09:33,347
It made me want to roll my eyes.

160
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:39,143
But he always shows up when
I'm most vulnerable and need him the most.

161
00:09:39,922 --> 00:09:42,010
He appears unexpectedly.

162
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:49,547
I was a bit scared when I started to like him.

163
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:53,514
Because I know we're different.

164
00:09:55,444 --> 00:09:57,846
But there are so many things that are the same.

165
00:09:57,846 --> 00:10:00,393
So, I wanted to be brave.

166
00:10:05,145 --> 00:10:08,316
Young people's love is that simple.

168
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:14,863
If there is any happy news,
remember to let us know.

169
00:10:14,863 --> 00:10:16,640
I don't know about that.

170
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,518
It's still early.

171
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:21,204

00:10:53,068 --> 00:10:55,029
You look beautiful today.

179
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:04,079
Ms. Pan.

180
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,748
Let's talk.

181
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:06,915
Director Qian, you...

182
00:11:06,915 --> 00:11:08,752
Xin Tong. Sorry to keep you waiting.

183
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:10,944
Mom, Xin Tong and I
have plans to go to the movies.

184
00:11:10,944 --> 00:11:12,531
We'll get going.

185
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,591
Let's go.

186
00:11:25,326 --> 00:11:28,562
Why didn't you tell me your mom
is a director at Hongfa?

187
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:31,106
You didn't tell me you work at Hongfa either.

188
00:11:31,106 --> 00:11:34,735
Everyone here is my boss. I was so scared.

189
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:36,862
If I had known, I wouldn't have agreed
even for a million dollars.

190
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:39,723
A million? Are you sure?

191
00:11:39,723 --> 00:11:42,060
Is that the point now?

192
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:46,331
What else is the point?

193
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:51,543
The point is, we've been walking for some time.

194
00:11:52,186 --> 00:11:53,921
Why are you still holding my hand?

195
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:57,299
We agreed on three hours.
There are still three minutes left.

196
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:59,677
But we don't have to put on an act anymore.

197
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:00,939
My mom is scary.

198
00:12:00,939 --> 00:12:02,621
She'll send people to spy on us.

199
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:04,584
It's better to be cautious.

200
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,103
Don't look around.

201
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:19,115
How long do we have to hold hands?

202
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,871
We should at least cross the next intersection.

203
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,470
I'm off.

204
00:12:45,906 --> 00:12:47,766
Xiao Qi.

205
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:51,228
Remember to take the supplements
I asked Pan Xin Tong to buy for you.

206
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:53,105
It'll help you sleep better.

207
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:56,900
You have to take good care of yourself now.

208
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,969
All right. Go home early.

209
00:12:58,969 --> 00:13:01,057
- Bye.
- Bye.

210
00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:31,351
Something 'bout love.

211
00:13:31,351 --> 00:13:34,313
Something 'bout dream.

212
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:38,025
Broken at a blast.

213
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:40,360
Something good.

214
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,654
Some mistakes.

215
00:13:42,654 --> 00:13:46,950
Blue will come through all at last.

216
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:48,869
Try once again.

217
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:51,288
Take one more chance.

218
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:57,503
Make bad decisions in your fucking life.

219
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,589
Fucking life.

220
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:04,426
Mind the signs you'll find.

221
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:07,679
Hey young boy tell me

222
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:10,641
what's your trouble at the time.

223
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:13,018
It's all right.

224
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:15,062
Close your eyes.

225
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:17,981
Let the flow rhyme, hang on tight.

226
00:14:17,981 --> 00:14:21,819
Don't be scared to fight.

227
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:27,866
Hey, young boy, tell me
what you desire at the time.

228
00:14:27,866 --> 00:14:30,536
Just rhyme.

229
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:38,209
You'll be fine, you will thrive, be fine.

230
00:14:47,903 --> 00:14:50,222
Something good.

231
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:52,432
Some mistakes.

232
00:14:52,432 --> 00:14:57,854
Blue will come through all at last.

233
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,995
Happy birthday, Mom.

234
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,500
Aren't you going to explain?

235
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:20,711
Let's stop going in circles
with the same topic.

236
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:23,213
You knew I invited Lin Feng Hua today.

237
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:25,310
Why did you bring your girlfriend?

238
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:26,758
You're trying to embarrass me.

239
00:15:26,758 --> 00:15:28,302
Anyway, she's not here.

240
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,483
Lin Feng Hua isn't interested in me,

241
00:15:30,483 --> 00:15:31,722
so let's not get ahead of ourselves.

242
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:35,559
Thank goodness she didn't come,
or it would've been so awkward.

243
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:38,020
But Director Lin knows
I'm trying to set you two up.

244
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,897
It's still embarrassing.

245
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:41,298
Isn't it for the best?

246
00:15:41,298 --> 00:15:43,468
Just give up on this idea.

247
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,992
So, you really did it on purpose.

248
00:15:49,965 --> 00:15:52,409
Do you think if you embarrass me like this,

249
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:55,832
I'll give up on the marriage alliance
with Director Lin's family?

250
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,250
You underestimate your mother.

251
00:16:01,059 --> 00:16:04,004
Why are you so stubborn?

252
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,505
What do you want then?

253
00:16:05,505 --> 00:16:10,093
You've had so many girlfriends,
none of them lasted more than three months.

254
00:16:10,093 --> 00:16:14,056
Pan Xin Tong will eventually
become a thing of the past.

255
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:16,927
When that time comes,
I'll wait for you two to break up,

256
00:16:16,927 --> 00:16:19,311
then I'll help you
and Lin Feng Hua get together.

257
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,021
You already know my habits.

258
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:24,566
Aren't you worried Lin Feng Hua and I
will get divorced after three months?

259
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:27,761
In this day and age,
there's no such thing as a marriage alliance.

260
00:16:27,761 --> 00:16:30,724
I know exactly what's right for me.

261
00:16:31,465 --> 00:16:35,494
Mom, that's not going to work anymore.

262
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:48,090
Then when will you
acknowledge your responsibility?

263
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,926
You promised your dad you'd take over.

264
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:53,261
You said you wanted to expand the company.

265
00:16:53,261 --> 00:16:56,056
If you didn't rely on a marriage alliance,
could you have done it alone?

266
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:58,809
So, you still don't believe in my abilities.

267
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:01,436
My only value is to sacrifice my happiness.

268
00:17:01,436 --> 00:17:02,729
Is that what you think?

269
00:17:02,729 --> 00:17:04,022
Yi Fu, why do you have to...

270
00:17:04,022 --> 00:17:06,817
It's your birthday, Mom.
I don't want to argue with you.

271
00:17:09,086 --> 00:17:12,197
Why don't you make a wish
before your birthday ends?

272
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,950
Hope that you have an obedient son.

273
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:18,895
Before that, I'll get to
know Pan Xin Tong better.

274
00:17:20,389 --> 00:17:25,488
By the way, maybe we'll prove you wrong
and last more than three months.

275
00:18:06,601 --> 00:18:08,128
Sorry to keep you waiting.

276
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:09,755
Where were we?

277
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:14,621
I want to tell you that
this painter's health has been...

278
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:29,194
Xiao Qi.

279
00:18:33,726 --> 00:18:35,322
Get your hands off me!

280
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:37,869
- Your pants.
- Wait, your key...

281
00:18:40,971 --> 00:18:43,330
- Wait.
- Bye.

282
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,458
- Wait.
- Xiao Qi.

283
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,442
Slowly.

284
00:18:47,442 --> 00:18:48,860
Wait a minute.

285
00:19:12,275 --> 00:19:14,699
Your hands will be sore tomorrow.

286
00:19:16,696 --> 00:19:18,994
I'll go home and soak them in hot water.

287
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,205
Well...

288
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,896
When should we meet tomorrow?

289
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,713
I'll let you know when I'm done.

290
00:19:33,713 --> 00:19:35,006
Okay.

291
00:19:41,995 --> 00:19:45,467
Then, good night.

292
00:19:46,368 --> 00:19:49,270
Good night.

293
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:59,030
Hey.

294
00:20:06,746 --> 00:20:08,165
Good night.

295
00:21:15,373 --> 00:21:16,691
Yue Jiao.

296
00:21:16,691 --> 00:21:18,068
Yue Jiao.

297
00:21:21,237 --> 00:21:27,323
[Hou Ze: I never thought I'd say goodbye
to you in this manner.]

298
00:21:40,523 --> 00:21:41,800
Hey.

299
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,551
What are you doing?

300
00:21:43,551 --> 00:21:46,638
I'm going to the hospital to see my mom.

301
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:47,905
You're going to the hospital?

302
00:21:47,905 --> 00:21:49,683
Why didn't you ask me to go with you?

303
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:51,685
What for?

304
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,730
I have a car. I can give you a ride.

305
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:55,322
You've met my mom.

306
00:21:55,322 --> 00:21:57,089
I want to meet yours, too.

307
00:21:58,608 --> 00:21:59,923
Hello?

308
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:21,107
Handsome, do you have a cigarette?

309
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,306
Handsome, do you have a cigarette?

310
00:22:29,725 --> 00:22:33,243
Handsome, do you have a cigarette?

311
00:22:33,243 --> 00:22:34,561
I don't smoke.

312
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:39,357
Well, can you buy me a pack of these?

313
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:42,152
Please, buy it for me.

314
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:44,112
I can't. Please.

315
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:45,698
My daughter is really pretty.
I'll introduce her to you.

316
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:46,948
No, thanks.

317
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:47,991
Why not?

318
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:51,453
She's really great, so filial and pretty.

319
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:52,537
Let me show you her photo.

320
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:54,080
It's fine, don't bother.

321
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,042
- Really?
- No need. I'll buy it for you.

322
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,544
- This one?
- Yes.

323
00:22:58,544 --> 00:22:59,753
So handsome and kindhearted.

324
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:01,548
Thought you'd make a good son-in-law.

325
00:23:01,548 --> 00:23:03,995
- Are you sure you don't want to look?
- It's really okay. Thank you.

326
00:23:04,653 --> 00:23:06,199
Thank you.

327
00:23:24,044 --> 00:23:26,529
You're a patient. Are you sure you can smoke?

328
00:23:26,529 --> 00:23:29,391
I'm going to die anyway.
It's better to smoke.

329
00:23:29,391 --> 00:23:32,018
I'd rather die a quick death than suffer.

330
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:34,954
Why won't it light up?

331
00:23:34,954 --> 00:23:37,540
Why did you buy cigarettes without a lighter?

332
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,750
You gave me 100 yuan.

333
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,502
- This pack of cigarettes is 140 yuan.
- It's not lighting up.

334
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:42,363
Shi Mei Hua, what are you doing?

335
00:23:42,363 --> 00:23:44,031
Pan Xin Tong!

336
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,509
Why are you with my mom?

337
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:48,676
She's your mom?

338
00:23:48,676 --> 00:23:50,804
You know each other?

339
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:52,973
She's the girl I was going to introduce you to.

340
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:54,641
Introduce what? Don't change the subject.

341
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:56,209
Where did you get it?

342
00:23:56,209 --> 00:23:58,580
It has nothing to do with him.

343
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:01,231
You gave my mom cigarettes!

344
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:02,524
I bought them for her. I...

345
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:04,401
You bought cigarettes for her?

346
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:05,404
I have to explain this.

347
00:24:05,404 --> 00:24:09,283
My mom is sick. How could you let her smoke?

348
00:24:09,283 --> 00:24:11,158
This looks heavy. Let me carry it for you.

349
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:13,269
Auntie, I'm here to pick you up.
Let me take you to the car.

350
00:24:13,269 --> 00:24:15,102
Let's go! Hurry!

351
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:31,292
[Zhou Xiao Qi: When will you be done?
Have time for dinner tonight?]

352
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:33,576
Wow.

353
00:25:34,382 --> 00:25:36,184
Do you want something to drink?

354
00:25:36,184 --> 00:25:38,412
I'll get it for you. Give it to me.

355
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:39,913
No, stop.

356
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:42,464
Just go on. Don't mind me.

357
00:25:43,975 --> 00:25:46,419
It's so good to be home.

358
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:48,254
I'm hungry.

359
00:25:48,254 --> 00:25:49,906
I'm so hungry.

360
00:25:49,906 --> 00:25:51,882
Okay, I'll go cook.

361
00:25:52,734 --> 00:25:54,511
- Um...
- Leave it here.

362
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:56,721
I'll do it. You go on.

363
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:59,682
- Just put it anywhere.
- Stay and eat with us later, okay?

364
00:25:59,682 --> 00:26:00,975
Okay.

365
00:26:01,701 --> 00:26:03,811
Of course, stay and eat.

366
00:26:03,811 --> 00:26:04,813
What about this?

367
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:05,857
- Put it on the table.
- Okay.

368
00:26:05,857 --> 00:26:08,842
Sit down. Make yourself at home.

369
00:26:08,842 --> 00:26:10,134
Thank you.

370
00:26:13,213 --> 00:26:15,156
What's your name?

371
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:17,497
- My name is Xin Yi Fu.
- Yi Fu.

372
00:26:17,497 --> 00:26:20,895
Yi as in perseverance, and Fu as in master.

373
00:26:20,895 --> 00:26:23,473
Yi Fu.

374
00:26:23,473 --> 00:26:27,009
Yi Fu, let me ask you something.

375
00:26:28,384 --> 00:26:31,513
What's your relationship with Xin Tong?

376
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:34,926
We're friends.

377
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,761
Friends, huh?

378
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:40,473
Are you just ordinary friends,
or something more?

379
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:49,458
An embarrassed grin? That's flirting.

380
00:26:50,166 --> 00:26:51,609
Flirting, huh?

381
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:56,239
That's not good.
If you keep flirting, the love will fade.

382
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:58,283
Mom, don't scare him.

383
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,768
I'm not scaring him. It's true.

384
00:27:00,768 --> 00:27:03,548
Many people are after Xin Tong.

385
00:27:04,305 --> 00:27:05,790
She got scared and hid in there.

386
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,250
The egg!

387
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,335
Be careful!

388
00:27:09,335 --> 00:27:13,279
I was just about to compliment you
on your cooking.

389
00:27:14,983 --> 00:27:18,177
- It smells so good.
- Food is served!

390
00:27:18,177 --> 00:27:19,596
Let's eat!

391
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:23,474
This is the smell I missed most
when I was in the hospital.

392
00:27:23,474 --> 00:27:26,220
You can't get this anywhere else. Try it.

393
00:27:26,828 --> 00:27:29,480
I didn't know you were such a good cook.

394
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,316
No, it's just home cooking.

395
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,693
Are you kidding?

396
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:35,069
When you two get married,

397
00:27:35,069 --> 00:27:37,405
you have to let her come back
and cook this for me sometime.

398
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:40,700
Otherwise, I'll bother you every day.

399
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,977
Aren't you hungry? Eat more.

400
00:27:42,977 --> 00:27:46,531
- Here you go.
- I want eggs, not tomatoes!

401
00:27:49,309 --> 00:27:53,716
It feels so good,
like we're a family eating together.

402
00:27:56,482 --> 00:27:58,217
But let me tell you about this guy.

403
00:27:58,217 --> 00:27:59,927
When I asked him to buy cigarettes for me,

404
00:27:59,927 --> 00:28:02,430
I told him I'd introduce him to my daughter.

405
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,890
He said, "Don't bother."

406
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:06,726
"No need."

407
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:09,065
Do you regret it now?

408
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:14,152
A little.

409
00:28:14,152 --> 00:28:18,137
He said, "A little."

410
00:28:18,137 --> 00:28:20,077
A little.

411
00:28:23,384 --> 00:28:26,746
- No way. You dropped it again.
- You're acting strange today.

412
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:28,876
- I'm fine.
- You dropped an egg while cooking.

413
00:28:28,876 --> 00:28:32,254
Now you dropped your chopsticks.

414
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:35,180
Eat more. Do you want some soup?

Your call has been forwarded to voicemail.

418
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:21,512
Please leave a message after the beep.

419

Sorry, the number you dialed is unavailable.

Please try again later.

Thank you for today.

422
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:41,971
My mom seems to like you a lot.
She's smiling so happily.

423
00:29:41,971 --> 00:29:44,558
I'm a good son-in-law, right?

424
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:47,744
She likes to joke around.
Don't take it seriously.

425
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:50,204
She always makes me angry
and laugh at the same time.

426
00:29:50,204 --> 00:29:53,416
But I can't let her see me snickering,
or she'll make it worse.

427
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:55,087
Your mom is much more interesting than mine.

428
00:29:55,087 --> 00:29:57,781
My mom scolds me even when I joke around.

429
00:29:59,605 --> 00:30:01,966
Your mom must be displeased with me.

430
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:06,304
She must want you to break up
with this fake girlfriend, right?

431
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:08,517
My mom has never been happy
with any of my girlfriends.

432
00:30:08,517 --> 00:30:09,583
Don't care about her.

433
00:30:09,583 --> 00:30:11,310
If I like whoever, only my opinion matters.

434
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,231
Be careful.

435
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:26,575
Get home safely.

436
00:30:27,508 --> 00:30:29,702
Go back first.

437
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:31,538
You should leave first.

438
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:34,873
Bye.

439
00:30:51,365 --> 00:30:55,545
My friend said to spice things up a bit.

440
00:30:55,545 --> 00:30:57,755
It might help.

441
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:14,457
Is it helping?

442
00:31:40,122 --> 00:31:42,066
How much longer?

443
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:45,027
Bear with it. Just a few more minutes.

444
00:31:45,027 --> 00:31:48,848
I read online that doctors say this won't work.

445
00:31:48,848 --> 00:31:53,119
A doctor recommended it to me, too.

446
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:55,415
I'd rather believe it.

447
00:31:57,098 --> 00:32:02,753
By the way, Dr. Wu suggested
that we go to the hospital for a checkup.

448
00:32:02,753 --> 00:32:05,239
Maybe there's a better way.

449
00:32:05,239 --> 00:32:07,034
What do you think?

450
00:32:15,474 --> 00:32:18,160
Do you want to stay here tonight?

451
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,482
I have something on tomorrow.

452
00:32:20,482 --> 00:32:22,357

456
00:33:29,899 --> 00:33:31,634
What is it?

457
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:33,094
A patient shoplifted.

458
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:34,194
The shop owner called the police.

459
00:33:34,194 --> 00:33:35,246
They're at the police station now.

460
00:33:35,246 --> 00:33:37,473

Hello, I'm here for Ms. Zhou Xiao Qi.

463
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:15,135
She's over there.

464
00:34:28,416 --> 00:34:30,985
Hi, I'm Ms. Zhou's psychiatrist.

465
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:32,445
Your ID, please.

466
00:34:38,134 --> 00:34:43,939
Ms. Zhou said she has a history
of stealing and sees you.

467
00:34:43,939 --> 00:34:46,527
The diagnosis is kleptomania.

468
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:50,755
It's an impulse control disorder.

469
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:54,842
They use the thrill of stealing
to divert their anxiety.

470
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:59,930
But can she please control herself,
or she'll cause trouble.

471
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:02,433
I'll take down the details.
Please wait over there.

472
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:03,725
Thank you.

473
00:35:24,416 --> 00:35:30,284
I thought stealing a lighter was just
a spur-of-the-moment thing.

474
00:35:33,964 --> 00:35:36,217
I didn't know you were a habitual thief.

475
00:35:38,778 --> 00:35:43,990
When I can't have something,
I want to steal it.

476
00:35:45,701 --> 00:35:50,339
Don't try to justify your outburst
and get away with it.

477
00:35:50,339 --> 00:35:53,067
Don't forget that you're not my psychiatrist.

478
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:00,982

we'll consider in vitro fertilization.

00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:44,204
We can still be colleagues and friends.

534
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:46,898
You always think you handle it well,
but the girls are heartbroken.

535
00:43:46,898 --> 00:43:48,903
They even call me crying.

536
00:43:50,477 --> 00:43:52,337
But that's not my problem.

537
00:43:52,337 --> 00:43:54,308
All my breakups were amicable.

538
00:43:54,308 --> 00:43:55,424
How was I supposed to know?

539
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:57,634
You never date anyone
for more than three months.

540
00:43:57,634 --> 00:43:58,721
Who could stand that?

541
00:43:58,721 --> 00:44:00,304
You should just be clear from the start.

542
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:02,264
It wouldn't be wonderful if I did.

543
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:03,849
I just follow my feelings.

544
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:06,351
It just happens to be around three months.

545
00:44:06,351 --> 00:44:08,854
If we force it, all that's left is fighting.

546
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:12,190
Isn't it better to end it at the best moment?

547
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:13,943
- Quit while you're ahead.
- Exactly.

548
00:44:13,943 --> 00:44:15,777
That makes sense.

549
00:44:15,777 --> 00:44:17,555
- It really does.
- Right?

550
00:44:17,555 --> 00:44:18,930
Yes.

551
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:24,546
Why aren't you replying to my messages?

552
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:27,957
You're stealing.

553
00:44:28,923 --> 00:44:31,657
If I reply, I become an accomplice.

554
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:34,254
You are an accomplice.

555
00:44:39,676 --> 00:44:41,867
I'm going to report you to the police.

556
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,657
I want to hug you.

557
00:45:14,336 --> 00:45:16,525
What's going on?

558
00:45:19,466 --> 00:45:21,062
It's nothing.

559
00:45:22,277 --> 00:45:23,381
You're so strange.

560
00:45:23,381 --> 00:45:25,764
Just get along with the bigshot.

561
00:45:25,764 --> 00:45:28,308
You're asking for trouble.

562
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:30,010
Isn't he handsome?

563
00:45:30,869 --> 00:45:33,438
Yes, they're all handsome when they're young.

564
00:45:33,438 --> 00:45:35,460
Oh, so handsome.
