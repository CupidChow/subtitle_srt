she had chemo, then it relapsed again.

178
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:18,811
She spent so much money,
but she still died in the end.

179
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,187
You're different from my auntie.

180
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:22,024
I am different from her!

181
00:16:22,024 --> 00:16:24,753
We're different. She had a house to sell.

182
00:16:24,753 --> 00:16:26,360
I have nothing to give you.

183
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,737
You have to work hard,
earn money, and work part-time.

184
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:30,698
- I just don't want that!
- It's okay.

185
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,408
Just be good.

186
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:33,893
I don't want to!

187
00:16:33,893 --> 00:16:36,412
Mom, please stop making a fuss! Okay?

188
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,839
Can you just listen to the doctor
and get chemotherapy?

189
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:41,157
Then you won't...

190
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,045
I won't die?

191
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:47,207
Yeah, who says I won't die?

192
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:49,415
I'm not afraid of dying.

193
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:52,094
I'm not afraid of dying!

194
00:16:54,939 --> 00:16:57,086
Tong Tong!

195
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:05,044
Pan Xin Tong, what are you doing?

196
00:17:13,007 --> 00:17:15,576
Mom.

197
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:18,333
I'm really tired.

198
00:17:19,248 --> 00:17:22,416
I just want you to be well. That's it. I'll be fine.

199
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:26,169
But can you please stop wearing me out?

200
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:40,536
It's nothing.

201
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:42,574
It's okay now.

202
00:18:47,309 --> 00:18:48,961
It's okay.

203
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:52,304
You'll get better soon, okay?

204
00:19:11,472 --> 00:19:14,089
[Certificate of Completion, Gu Hou Ze]

205
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:29,731
Dr. Gu, Ms. Zhou Xiao Qi is here.

206
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:43,830
Please have a seat.

207
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:49,700
We have tea, coffee, and water. Do you need anything?

208
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:54,466
No, I'm just here for sleeping pills.

209
00:19:56,044 --> 00:19:57,738
How long have you had insomnia?

210
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,448
Just lately.

211
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:00,824
What about you?

212
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:04,144
I often see you feeding stray cats
in the middle of the night.

213
00:20:04,144 --> 00:20:06,246
Do you have insomnia, too?

214
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:08,926
I didn't know a doctor could have insomnia.

215
00:20:08,926 --> 00:20:11,065
Is something troubling you?

216
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:17,215
Has anything else special happened in your life?

217
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:25,182
I don't want to hear what
you psychiatrists have to say.

218
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:27,695
Just prescribe me some medicine.

219
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:31,605
There must be a reason you can't sleep well.

220
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,079
Since you've already come to visit,

221
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:36,069
it's my responsibility
to provide professional help.

222
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:39,535
Let's talk. Maybe it'll help.

223
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:03,541
Sure.

224
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,107
Let's talk.

225
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:12,187
May I ask what you do for a living?

226
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:13,397
Art dealing.

227
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:14,856
Do you like it?

228
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:17,592
Yes, I like making money.

229
00:21:17,592 --> 00:21:20,193
And I'm a good storyteller.

230
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:26,175
Then... what's troubling you lately?

231
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:33,392
Wow.

232
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:34,543
Do you like it?

233
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:35,627
Yes.

234
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,754
I'm just worried about my taste.

235
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:40,048
Today is our one-year anniversary.

236
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:44,011
So, I asked a female employee
to pick them out for me.

237
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:46,029
Here.

238
00:21:46,029 --> 00:21:48,712
I hope you like it.

239
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,569
Thank you.

240
00:21:55,122 --> 00:21:59,209
I've been thinking a lot
while I was in the hospital.

241
00:21:59,209 --> 00:22:02,571
I've worked so hard all my life
to earn so much money.

242
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:08,035
But Shu Juan and Xiao An are gone.

243
00:22:09,386 --> 00:22:11,396
If I'm gone, too,

244
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:14,954
I'll have nothing left in this world.

245
00:22:14,954 --> 00:22:17,037
What a pity.

246
00:22:18,729 --> 00:22:22,268
Xiao Qi, I've been thinking.

247
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:27,380
I'm getting old.

248
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:31,171
Can you have a child for me?

249
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:36,730
If we have a child, we can get married.

250
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:40,321
Everything I have will be yours in the future.

251
00:22:43,201 --> 00:22:45,749
Do you plan to marry him?

252
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:51,192
Rationally speaking, it's a good choice.

253
00:22:52,721 --> 00:22:54,623
Emotionally?

254
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:56,537
Do you love him?

255
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,500
Is love fun?

256
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:09,652
Two people must love each other to be together?

257
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:14,184
Each can choose what they need.

258
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:16,017
Have you...

259
00:23:18,038 --> 00:23:20,399
decided to have his baby?

260
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,984
Or are you unsure?

261
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:25,468
- Is this question bothering you?
- We've talked too much.

262
00:23:25,468 --> 00:23:27,926
Are you going to prescribe the medicine?

263
00:23:29,966 --> 00:23:36,149
I just think that right now,
your problem can't be solved by medicine.

264
00:23:36,149 --> 00:23:38,706
So, you're not going to prescribe the medicine.

265
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:42,838
That's fine.

266
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:45,799
If you don't prescribe the medicine,
I'll get it from another clinic.

267
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:48,427
Let's not waste each other's time.

268
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,946
Thank you.

269
00:23:50,946 --> 00:23:55,945
You seek professional help,
yet you don't trust the doctor's judgment.

270
00:24:04,111 --> 00:24:08,196
Who says a doctor knows me
or what I need better than I do?

271
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:09,533
Not necessarily.

272
00:24:09,533 --> 00:24:14,053
If the doctor can help, you'll feel a lot better.

273
00:24:17,105 --> 00:24:19,755
You should try to trust people.

274
00:24:21,407 --> 00:24:24,800
How about I book your next appointment?

275
00:24:26,907 --> 00:24:29,550
You can decide whether to come or not.

276
00:24:32,154 --> 00:24:34,498
Man Qing, give me the stamps
for the health check.

277
00:24:34,498 --> 00:24:36,121
Okay.

278
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:39,266
This is the magazine interview I scheduled for Dr. Gu.

279
00:24:39,266 --> 00:24:40,676
Add it to the itinerary.

280
00:24:40,676 --> 00:24:43,177
- Okay.
- Remember to remind Dr. Gu.

281
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:49,234
Ms. Zhou, this is
your next follow-up appointment.

282
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:51,862
Thank you.

283
00:24:57,888 --> 00:24:59,831
A new case.

284
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:01,503
Yes, Zhou Xiao Qi.

285
00:25:01,503 --> 00:25:03,329
It's her first time here today.

286
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:29,177
I saw a new patient today.

287
00:25:29,177 --> 00:25:31,159
She's very pretty.

288
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:34,950
Really?

289
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,459
She has a good figure.

290
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:49,759
How did you notice that?

291
00:25:52,108 --> 00:25:55,924
I have an early day tomorrow, so let's sleep.

292
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:58,158
What are you doing?

293
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,760
Getting a condom.

294
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:03,438
It's okay.

295
00:27:03,438 --> 00:27:07,197
I'm in my safe period. No need for that.

296
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:23,158
What?

297
00:27:27,704 --> 00:27:30,690
Are you that afraid I'll get pregnant?

298
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,913
You don't want to marry me?

299
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:39,044
We've talked about this.

300
00:27:46,379 --> 00:27:48,658
I'm going for a smoke.

301
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:55,357
Are you smoking?

302
00:28:56,209 --> 00:28:58,111
No.

303
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:01,865
You can't smoke if you're going to get pregnant.

304
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:04,786
No, I just found it.

305
00:29:17,216 --> 00:29:19,799
Ms. Pan, your certificate of deposit termination
has been processed.

306
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,593
Thank you.

307
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,303
Excuse me, I have another question.

308
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:27,140
I received a message from your company
about a credit loan service.

309
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,225
I'd like to know how much I can get.

310
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:32,796
Okay, please have a seat.
I'll get a specialist to explain to you.

311
00:29:32,796 --> 00:29:34,727
Okay, thank you.

312
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:46,170
­[Scumbag Zhao]

313
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:54,844
What is it?

314
00:29:57,162 --> 00:30:01,257
My boss heard somehow
that I hadn't handled my relationship well.

315
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:04,784
I'm afraid this will affect his perception of me.

316
00:30:07,155 --> 00:30:09,516
You're marrying his daughter.

317
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:11,495
You don't have to worry.

318
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:14,676
Don't say that.

319
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:20,487
You were the one who supported me most
when I took the bar exam.

320
00:30:20,487 --> 00:30:25,256
I believe that even now,
you still want me to succeed, don't you?

321
00:30:25,256 --> 00:30:27,617
How dare you bring that up?

322
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:31,329
I paid for your bar exam tuition,
living expenses, and rent.

323
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:34,168
Please pay me back.

324
00:30:34,168 --> 00:30:37,794
But you asked me to move in
with you to save money.

325
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:39,838
I took it as your way of supporting me.

326
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:42,173
You said you'd pay me back
after you passed the bar exam.

327
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:44,634
That's why you have to come to my wedding.

328
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:45,636
Think about it.

329
00:30:45,636 --> 00:30:47,048
If you come and give us your blessing,

330
00:30:47,048 --> 00:30:50,348
we can tell my boss that we broke up amicably.

331
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:52,400
When I become a partner,

332
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,667
I'll have the money to pay you back.

333
00:30:56,204 --> 00:31:00,834
How dare you ask me to attend
your wedding with your mistress?

334
00:31:00,834 --> 00:31:04,220
And on my birthday. You did it on purpose.

335
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,809
But...

336
00:31:09,008 --> 00:31:14,032
Darn, I completely forgot
that it was your birthday.

337
00:31:17,294 --> 00:31:19,669
You forgot my birthday and what you gifted me.

338
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:22,130
- I really forgot.
- What else do you remember about me?

339
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:25,761
I'm sorry. I really forgot. I...

340
00:31:25,761 --> 00:31:29,325
Please help me this time, okay? I'm begging you.

341
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:35,077
Once I become a partner,
I'll have the money to pay you back.

342
00:31:43,459 --> 00:31:47,224
Okay, forget it. I'm being unreasonable.

343
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:56,456
Hey.

344
00:31:57,351 --> 00:31:58,942
Well?

345
00:32:03,354 --> 00:32:06,007
I can go, but on one condition.

346
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:08,384
As long as you're willing to come,
I'll agree to anything.

347
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:13,072
My mom's cancer relapsed
and she's against chemotherapy.

348
00:32:13,072 --> 00:32:17,452
You know she admires you as a lawyer,
so she listens to you.

349
00:32:17,452 --> 00:32:19,354
Talk to her.

350
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:21,272
No problem.

351
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:25,445
But I haven't told her that we broke up.

352
00:32:25,445 --> 00:32:31,225
So, you want me to keep... pretending
to be your boyfriend?

353
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:38,791
