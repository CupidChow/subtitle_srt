00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:46,190
My Lord.

5
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:48,350
My Lord.

6
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:50,590
My Lord!

7
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:54,590
How can the President of the Supreme Court

8
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:56,430
be so petty?

9
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:58,710
You're calling me petty?

10
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:00,550
My Lord.

11
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:02,030
You're finally willing to talk to me.

12
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,110
My Lord.

13
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,150
Don't be angry, okay?

14
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:12,190
Don't be angry.

15
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:18,950
Don't be angry.

16
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:28,350
Dear customers, please come in.

17
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:29,830
Please come in.

18
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:40,870
Everyone.

19
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,120
Please come in.

20
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:49,280
I'm so nervous.

21
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:50,110
Well...

22
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:52,350
What should we do?

23
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:53,710
It's okay.

24
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:54,750
Relax.

25
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,229
Lai Luo.

26
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,230
Don't you get nervous either.

27
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,750
No matter what happens,

28
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,070
I'll always be by your side.

29
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:05,680
Then you should concentrate.

30
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,070
Don't drop the ball.

31
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,070
Otherwise,

32
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,350
I need to save you.

33
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:10,800
No problem.

34
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,390
You'll...

35
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,110
Why will you save me instead?

36
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:22,390
My Lord.

37
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,510
I'm still too nervous to breathe.

38
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,030
What if I

39
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,230
slip up then?

40
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,829
What should I do?

41
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:31,950
It's okay.

42
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:32,829
Relax.

43
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,030
Lord Zhang, you're here.

44
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,030
Where is he?

45
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,110
Upstairs.

46
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,310
Please go upstairs.

47
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:40,510
Okay.

48
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,329
Good.

49
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,030
Lin Wanqing.

50
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:44,950
Look at me.

51
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,390
Trust me.

52
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,230
We are not acting at this moment.

53
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,829
What's happening is true.

54
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:51,990
I am your husband.

55
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:52,950
You are my wife.

56
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,680
Understand?

57
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:57,829
No matter what happens,

58
00:02:58,230 --> 00:02:59,230
you have me.

[Zhang Ren, the Marshal of Hongzhou Military Command]

60
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:13,870
Thank you for coming, Mr. Zhou.

61
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:16,550
Please forgive me for not welcoming you from afar.

62
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:18,430
You're welcome, Lord Zhang.

63
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,390
You can call me brother.

64
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,430
Okay.

65
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,230
Brother Zhang, I'll follow your advice then.

66
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:25,670
By the way,

67
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,829
Brother Zhou, I heard that you brought

68
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:30,230
your newly married wife.

69
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:31,710
Where is she?

70
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:32,910
Qing.

71
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,710
Lord Su is so into character.

72
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:36,990
I can't mess up.

73
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,790
My Lord.

74
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:47,310
Oh no.

75
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,630
My Lord.

76
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:56,910
You're so bad.

77
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,790
Lord Zhang. Excuse me.

78
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,150
My wife likes to tease me.

79
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,790
Lord Zhang. Please excuse her.

80
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:18,310
Boss, a pot of tea.

81
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,029
Okay.

82
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,860
How did I lose them?

83
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,390
Brother Zhou.

84
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,030
You must be tired after the trip.

85
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,470
Have a good rest today.

86
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,550
Tomorrow,

87
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,430
I will discuss

88
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,150
big issues with you.

89
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,590
I shall be here

90
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:37,670
waiting for you, Brother Zhang.

91
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,510
What a coincidence.

92
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:43,630
Surprised?

93
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:48,830
Cousin.

94
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,590
Why are you here?

95
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:52,270
Wan.

96
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:53,630
What are you talking about?

97
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:06,110
Brother Zhou, you brought someone else here?

98
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:07,750
Brother Zhang.

99
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,600
My wife's cousin is free at home.

100
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,190
So he came with us.

101
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,310
I know it's inappropriate.

102
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:16,350
But

103
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,190
when a woman gets unruly,

104
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:18,910
there's nothing you can do about it.

105
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,430
They only know

106
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:22,950
this is a business trip.

107
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:24,350
They know nothing else.

108
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:26,990
In that case,

109
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:28,950
tomorrow,

110
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:31,070
bring Mrs. Zhou's cousin together

111
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:32,390
to my place.

112
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:46,909
Well...

113
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,070
It's not all my fault.

114
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,390
How would I know

115
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:52,350
you would do such a dangerous thing?

116
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,270
Senior.

117
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:53,790
You...

118
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,870
My Lord.

119
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,230
I'm sorry.

120
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,430
At this point,

121
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:05,720
let's think about how to solve the present problem first.

122
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:07,830
Didn't that person

123
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,230
say anything?

124
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,550
Maybe

125
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,550
he bought your words.

126
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:15,150
People engaged in activities that could cost them their lives

127
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,510
are always extremely cunning.

128
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,310
Don't underestimate him.

129
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:21,110
[Zhang's Mansion]

130
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,630
My Lord.

131
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:28,590
Lord Zhou's name card has been checked repeatedly.

132
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:29,590
There's no problem.

133
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,310
Why are you here?

134
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,190
Wan.

135
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,430
What are you talking about?

136
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,510
But these people are very suspicious.

137
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:44,030
My Lord. What are you going to do?

138
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,720
Zhang Ren invited us to his mansion.

139
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,070
He might already be suspicious.

140
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,070
Be careful

141
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,310
when we get there.

142
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:17,070
Take these three guests to the West Chamber to rest.

143
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,310
Yes.

144
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:19,710
This way, please.

145
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:24,190
Lord Zhou, please come in.

146
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,830
Lord Zhang is waiting in the mansion.

147
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,190
Thank you.

148
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:37,590
My Lord.

149
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:38,950
Lord Zhou is here.

150
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:39,830
You may leave.

151
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:41,720
Brother Zhou.

152
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:42,830
Brother Zhang.

153
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:44,470
Brother Zhou, you must be tired.

154
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,630
It would be more comfortable

155
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:47,830
for you to stay in my mansion.

156
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,190
Guards.

157
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:50,790
Escort Mrs. Zhou to the guest room

158
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,350
and provide her with proper service.

159
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:53,790
I have something

160
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,870
to discuss with Lord Zhou.

161
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,040
Yes.

162
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,550
You go first.

163
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:58,590
I’ll come to you later.

164
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,950
Brother Zhou, please.

165
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:06,990
Brother Zhang, please.

166
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:07,710
Please.

167
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,230
Brother Zhou. Have some tea.

168
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:19,600
Thank you, Brother Zhang.

169
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:27,580
Greetings, Lord Zhou.

170
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:31,990
I heard that Zhou Yipu is a lecher.

171
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:35,030
If I send you to him,

172
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:37,309
he surely won't refuse.

173
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,309
This way,

174
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:43,080
you can easily monitor him.

175
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:45,350
Yes.

176
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:47,390
Brother Zhou.

177
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:48,990
Since Mrs. Zhou is not here,

178
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,150
let Lan'er serve you.

179
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:54,150
Zhang Ren wants to arrange a spy.

180
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:56,390
He thought I couldn't refuse him.

181
00:08:58,670 --> 00:08:59,630
Brother Zhang, thank you.

182
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,670
I’m so happy.

183
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,710
As long as you are happy.

184
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:04,910
Lan'er,

185
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:06,830
take good care of Lord Zhou.

186
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,070
Yes.
