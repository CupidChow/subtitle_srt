00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:41,590
My Lord,

00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:44,430
please forgive me

00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,790
and pretend that nothing has happened.

00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:48,590
Just forget it.

00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:57,350
What happened?

00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,150
Thank you, My Lord,

Lai Luo

13
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,480
and Ye Qing, for saving my life.

14
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,910
I thought I was going to die soon.

15
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:16,640
I didn't expect that I would still be alive.

16
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:19,190
It's okay.

17
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:20,590
As long as you

get along well with Lord Su

00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,030
from now on, it'll be fine.

20
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:27,950
My Lord,

21
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,510
if you need anything in the future,

22
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,830
as long as I can do it,

23
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,350
I'll try my best to help you

24
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:35,509
regardless of the cost.

25
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:45,830
Currently, I do have something

26
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:47,110
which I want to ask you to do.

27
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:49,310
So soon?

28
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:51,670
My Lord, please say it.

29
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:42,350
Take her away.

30
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:43,310
Go.

31
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:48,790
My Lord.

32
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,390
My Lord, please spare my life.

33
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,470
I was forced to do that.

34
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,990
My child was caught by them.

35
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:57,150
I had no choice

36
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:00,510
but to help them do that.

37
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:02,230
Who is he?

38
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,190
I don't know.

39
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:06,350
You don't even know

40
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,230
where the pigeon flew to?

41
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,710
They gave me the pigeon.

42
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,870
Only their pigeon knew

43
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,990
where it flew to itself.

44
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:18,950
How about we

45
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,430
tie a rope around its leg and walk it?

46
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:24,710
My Lord.

47
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:25,870
What should we do now?

48
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:31,950
Are you serious?

49
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,070
Me again?

50
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,630
They said that as long as you die,

51
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:41,790
I should immediately let off the fireworks as a signal

52
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:44,110
and then meet them at the intermediary agency in four hours

53
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,070
so as to get the antidote from them.

54
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:46,829
Okay.

55
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,990
You should meet him as planned.

56
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,110
This time, I'm sure he will personally ask someone to deal with it.

57
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:52,190
Don't worry.

58
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,070
I will ensure your safety.

59

62
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,590

89
