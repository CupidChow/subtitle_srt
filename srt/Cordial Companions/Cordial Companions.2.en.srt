4
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:46,630
My Lord,

5
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:47,910
I've brought you food.

6
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:49,310
Come in.

7
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:50,190
Yes.

8
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,070
Where should I put it?

9
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:56,150
Just put it over there.

10
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:05,790
Why is it him?

11
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,230
Please enjoy, My Lord.

12
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:11,789
I shall take my leave.

13
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:13,789
Stop!

14
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,550
My Lord.

15
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:21,390
Is there anything else?

16
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:31,630
Oh no.

17
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:33,190
He must have recognized me.

18
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:33,950
What should I do?

19
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:41,070
It's okay.

20
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,350
Maybe I can beat him.

21
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:44,950
Look up.

22
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:52,670
You look unfamiliar.

23
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:53,310
Newcomer?

24
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,390
Why is he...

25
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:55,470
Oh, right.

26
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,310
I was wearing a veil that night.

27
00:01:57,789 --> 00:01:58,789
What's your name?

28
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,230
Lin Wanqing.

29
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:03,870
Go back to your work.

30
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:05,870
Yes.

[The Supreme Court]

32

My Lord.

33
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,630
He De is too secretive.

34
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,190
We used all kinds of methods,

35
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,150
but he still didn't say anything.

36
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,150
He figured we don't dare to do it.

37
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:34,910
Then...

38
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,710
aren't we under his control?

39
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,190
Although we don't dare to do it,

40
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,990
the one who does is already here.

41
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:44,150
My Lord, you mean

42
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,590
we could use that female assassin?

43
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:47,350
But

44
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,750
she has been working in the kitchen all afternoon.

45
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:52,230
She was either washing or cutting vegetables.

46
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:54,790
She had no time to investigate where He De was.

47
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:33,790
My Lord,

48
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,630
I've brought your afternoon tea.

49
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:36,870
Come in.

50
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,030
Yes.

51
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:41,390
My Lord.

52
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:42,829
Shall I still put it here?

53
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,470
Please have some tea, My Lord.

What now?

57
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,150
My Lord, what else can I do for you?

58
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:10,470
My Lord,

59
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:11,990

60
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:15,590
Fine.

61

Let me help you.

66
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:19,590
What's wrong, My Lord?

67
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:23,790
Why do they always pose like that

68
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,950
every time he meets this female assassin?

69
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:29,510
I told you I didn't know how to mix the ink.

70
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:30,910
You insisted on letting me…

71
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:37,230

Yes.

82

83
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,830
She's the one.

84
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,870
I can't stay here for long.

85

I don't care if he's He De or Wang De.

86
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,510
Nor do I care if he's a corrupt official or a good one.

87
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:34,310

Get out.

where is my handkerchief?

117
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:31,830
I threw it away.

118
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,830
Threw it away?

119
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,190
How could you

120
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:36,830
throw away other people's stuff just like that?

121
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:38,150
Get out!
