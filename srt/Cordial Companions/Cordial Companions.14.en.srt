[Episode 14]

4
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:41,870
From Hongzhou to the capital,

5
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,470
at top speed,

6
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:45,190
it takes at most 5 days to make a round trip.

7
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:46,990
Zhang Ren is buying time.

8
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:47,960
I think he must have gone to confirm our identities

9
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,270
with Prince Liang.

10
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,550
Does that mean our identities might be exposed tomorrow

11
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:53,390
at the soonest?

12
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:55,710
Then what are we waiting for?

13
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:56,790
Let's run away now.

14
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:57,510
No hurry.

15
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,150
Our identities may not be exposed.

16
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:01,310
But if we run away now,

17
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:02,830
we will definitely alert them.

18
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,670
I don't understand your principles.

19
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:05,710
I only know

20
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:07,310
I can't let my junior be in danger.

21
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:07,990
Junior,

22
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,990
you have to listen to me this time.

23
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:11,230
Leave here with me now.

24
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:13,230
Maybe

25
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:14,710
it's not that serious.

26
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:15,990
Not that serious?

27
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:18,270
This is their place.

28
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:19,670
If we are not cautious enough,

29
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,230
all of us will die.

30
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:26,270
Wan,

31
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:28,430
why are you still hesitating?

32
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:30,830
This case

33
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,550
is really important to him.

34
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:34,870
No matter how important it is, it's his business.

35
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,150
It has nothing to do with you.

36
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:37,350
Besides,

37
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:39,270
you two are not a real couple.

38
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:41,390
You are thinking for him.

39
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:42,350
But what about him?

40
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,000
Has he ever thought for you?

41
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:55,710
The lord has always been decisive.

42
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:58,229
This is my first time seeing him hesitating.

43
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,110
This is also my first time feeling

44
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,110
he has changed.

45
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:10,870
-Let's leave here.
-Let's stay.

46
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,030
My Lord, why do you want to leave?

47
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,750
Is it because of what Senior said?

48
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,350
Then why do you want to stay?

49
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,070
Haven't you always been timid and cherished your life a lot?

50
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,070
Don't you know how dangerous it is to investigate a case?

51
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,030
Of course I know.

52
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,310
But I don't want to be a drag on you.

53
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,510
I also know it's important to make a thorough investigation of this case.

54
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,470
It's important to investigate the case.

55
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:30,950
But it's more important

56
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:31,990
to protect the people by my side.

57
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:41,520
[Zhang's Mansion]

58
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,000
According to my observation these days,

59
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,030
the patrol is the weakest from 01:00 to 03:00 every night.

60
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,870
It is the best time to escape.

61
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:58,360
Let's go.

62
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:01,430
My Lord.

63
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:03,910
Let's go.

64
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:29,790
Mr. Zhou,

65
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,390
where are you going at this hour?

66
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:35,870
My Lord,

67
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,190
I'm not feeling well.

68
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:41,870
It's okay.

69
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,280
We're going to the doctor now.

70
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,670
Mr. Zhang, you came at the right time.

71
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:50,310
My wife is not feeling well.

72
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,670
But you don't even have a doctor in your mansion.

73
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:57,950
Well...

74
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:06,830
She is sick?

75
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,550
Sorry, Madam.

76
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:14,310
Mr. Zhou,

77
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,149
don't worry.

78
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:18,750
I'm going to get a doctor for you.

79
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:24,910
There is nothing serious.

80
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,270
She is just weak.

81
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:30,510
Mr. Zhou,

82
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:31,670
the doctor said

83
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:34,240
there is nothing serious with her.

84
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,150
She will be fine

85
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,710
as long as you nurse her health.

86
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:38,510
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

87
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:55,790
Madam, please take the medicine.

88
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,230
My Lord, I want you to feed me.

89
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:03,870
Okay.

90
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:22,950
What was that about?

91
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,310
What do you mean?

92
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:27,790
Stop acting in front of me.

93
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,630
Are you crazy?

94
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,590
It was an emergency.

95
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:44,190
But you shouldn't hurt yourself no matter what.

96
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,430
I did this for everyone.

97
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,790
Don't be so mad.

98
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,060
What's wrong?

99
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,390
I'm not pretending.

100
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:08,040
It really hurts.

101
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:09,870
You deserve it.

102
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,240
Give me your hand.

103
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,710
[Zhang's Mansion]

104
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,990
Madam, how are you feeling?

105
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,350
My Lord, thank you for your concern.

106
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,600
I'm feeling much better.

107
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,430
The weather is nice today.

108
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,990
It's suitable to go out for a walk.

109
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,990
You haven't fully recovered yet.

110
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:48,310
If you catch a cold after going out,

111
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,470
Mr. Zhou will be really worried, right?

112
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,270
I'm fine.

113
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:54,110
I just want to walk around.

114
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,510
Madam, when you recover,

115
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,110
I'll arrange it for you.

116
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,630
Walking around is not urgent.

117
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:03,990
But when can I start

118
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,990
to do my business in Hongzhou?

119
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,790
It's not urgent either.

120
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,470
What do you mean, Mr. Zhang?

121
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,310
What do you mean, Mr. Zhou?

122
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:15,830
In this case,

123
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,390
I'll be frank with you.

124
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,950
Mr. Zhang has disappeared for several days.

125
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:22,350
And you asked your men to keep an eye on us in the mansion.

126
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,550
Although I'm not a high official,

127
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,230
I'm someone that His Highness thinks highly of.

128
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,870
If His Highness's business is delayed,

129
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,390
no one can afford the consequence.

130
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:34,310
My Lord,

131
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:35,830
the messenger is back.

132
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,470
Mr. Zhou, you misunderstood.

133
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,430
This is exactly what His Highness asked me to do.

134
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:01,190
My Lord,

135
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:02,950
since we can't leave now,

136
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,110
what should we do next?

137
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,750
We can only make a bet

138
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:06,390
according to my previous plan.

139
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:08,350
Tomorrow morning,

140
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,590
we'll take the initiative to go to Zhang Ren

141
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:10,550
and try our best to draw

142
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,110
the attention of Zhang Ren and the stewardess

143
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,360
to create an opportunity for Lai Luo.

144
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,590
But how can you know

145
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:18,590
what information that man will bring?

146
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,150
That's why I said "make a bet".

147
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,150
According to the case investigation experience of the Supreme Court,

148
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:25,790
a portrait is the most direct and the simplest way to verify something.

149
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:36,190
Sorry.
