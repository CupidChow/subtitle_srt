you are back.

00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:24,670
Mr. Zhou,

10
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,150
you must be tired.

11
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:27,270
Get some rest first.

12
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,550
That's strange.

13
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,270
Both the ore reserve

14
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:55,550
and the amount of weapons

15
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:57,150
have fallen short of my expectations.

16
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:59,710
Maybe

17
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,470
they have been put somewhere else.

18
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,430
But I've carefully checked the whole mine.

19
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,590
I didn't find any other places for storage.

20
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,030
Maybe Prince Liang just got started with his plan,

21
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,830
so he doesn't have that many supplies.

22
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,070
Right, My Lord,

23
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,430
the day before yesterday, I found something strange

24
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,150
somewhere near the yard.

25
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:26,630
Who's there?

26
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,390
You scared me.

27
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:31,470
Miss Lan'er,

28
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,950
it's you.

29
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:34,750
Well...

30
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:35,910
I had nothing to do.

31
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,270
So I walked around.

32
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:38,470
I was going back to my room.

33
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,590
Let me take you back.

34
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,230
Thank you, Miss Lan'er.

35
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,030
Why was Miss Lan'er so nervous?

36
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,350
Could it be

37
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,270
that there is a secret

38
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,430
in that small room?

39
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:04,550
Tonight,

40
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:05,990
let's go take a look.

42
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,310
Miss Lan'er

43
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,790
came out from that room in the daytime.

44
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,270
My Lord,

45
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,390
what's wrong?

46
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:14,630
That was close.

47
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,029
It's all gunpowder.

48
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:20,589
Let's go.

49
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:43,390
Stay alert.

50
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,240
Yes.

51
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:55,710
Is everything normal?

52
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,480
They have been in the room all night

53
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,390
and have never come out.

54
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,230
You've been here all the time?

55
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:00,750
Yes.

56
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:02,990
Maybe I thought too much.

57
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,470
Keep watching them.

58
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:05,590
Yes.

Fortunately, you're prepared.

60
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:27,310

61
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:30,070
what did you see in the booklet?

62
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,470
The way to make explosives

63
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,240
and the map of the capital.

64

00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,630
What on earth does he want?

68
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,430

if Vice President Wei

89
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:23,910
