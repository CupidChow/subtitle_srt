00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:46,990
Today is the last day for me

00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:49,150
to live in this world.

00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,670
So this is how it feels to count down

8
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,870
the time of my own life.

10
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:03,240
saved my life.

11
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,430
It's not my usual style

12
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,430
to repay someone's kindness with enmity.

13
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,150
So I've decided.

14
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:14,950
I'll just die, won't I?

15
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:18,990
It's no big deal.

16
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:24,190
As I'm looking back upon my short life,

17
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:26,550
although I have no parents,

18
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:30,510
luckily, my master and Senior Liang took care of me,

19
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,590
so I still lived happily

20
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,390
and carefreely.

21
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:43,670
Master.

22
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,350
I was

23
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,390
living an ordinary life

24
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:00,830
just like them.

25
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,480
It was not until I went to the Supreme Court that

26
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:09,470
I realized life could be so dramatic.

27
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,830
Within just a few days,

28
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,750
I experienced such misfortunes as being arrested,

29
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:18,510
assassinated,

30
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:20,990
and poisoned.

31
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:26,430
But luckily,

32
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:30,470
all these things will be over soon.

33
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,790
There won't be any scarier things anymore.

37

Give me one more bottle of wine.

38
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,230
Miss.

39
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:15,310
Stop drinking.

40
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,840
You're already drunk.

41
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,430
If I don't drink now,

42
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,270
when can I drink again?

43
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:34,990
Miss,

47

Go back with me.
