Look at this painting.

11
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:16,030
Is it the same as the one you saw in the beginning?

12
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:24,110
You loser.

Can we get down to business now?

17
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:43,000
Of course.

18
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:47,950
Mr. Zhou, you should know about heavy ore, right?

19
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:50,710
I knew it. They are making weapons privately.

20
00:01:52,789 --> 00:01:53,789
Of course I know.

21
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,200
Weapons made of it

22
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,150
are very sharp.

23
00:01:56,509 --> 00:02:00,070
Do you know how to smelt it?

24
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:02,350
Mr. Zhou, don't worry.

25
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,110
As long as you tell me

26
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,550
how to smelt it,

27

I'll take care of the rest.

28
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:11,430
Now it's confirmed

29
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,350
that Prince Liang is making weapons privately and plotting a rebellion.

30
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,430

Okay.

33
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:23,030
But I need to look at the ore sample first.

34
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,350
Why?

35
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,550
There are different kinds of heavy ore.

36
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,390
So there are different ways of smelting it.

37
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,950
I was in charge of official mines in other places.

38
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,910
I know little about the heavy ore in Hongzhou.

39
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,110

The messenger was almost killed by Prince Liang.

56
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:15,950
He was afraid that they would know

57
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,030
and would kill him.

58
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,670
That's why he lied, right?

59
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,110
I asked Ye Qing to give him money

60
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,470
and let him run as far as he can.

61
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,390
