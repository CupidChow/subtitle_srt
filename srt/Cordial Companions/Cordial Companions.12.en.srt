[Episode 12]

4
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:47,670
Miss, is the guest room so far away?

5
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,270
If Lord Su just now was implying something to me,

6
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:51,910
what does it mean?

7
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:56,790
My Lord.

8
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:58,430
I'll pour you some wine.

9
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:03,310
My Lord.

10
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,670
I'll feed you.

11
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:06,430
Thank you, Miss Lan'er.

12
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,150
-Don't touch me.
-Madam!

13
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,350
Zhou Yipu.

14
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:15,789
I knew something was wrong with you.

15
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,310
Honey, let me explain.

16
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,230
It's not what you think.

17
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:19,470
Stop quibbling.

18
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,470
Liar.

19
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:21,830
You promised me

20
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,750
you would love only me in the future.

21
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:24,630
Honey.

22
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,430
You misunderstood.

23
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:26,430
Really.

24
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:27,910
If you don't believe me,

25
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:29,150
you can ask Brother Zhang.

26
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:32,350
Okay.

27
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:33,509
Tell me.

28
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:36,190
I saw her hugging you and almost kissed you.

29
00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:38,830
Did you send me away on purpose?

30
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:40,509
Mrs. Zhou.

31
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:41,550
You misunderstood.

32
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:43,990
I asked Lan'er to serve Brother Zhou.

33
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,310
Serve him?

34
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:46,990
He is my husband.

35
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,470
Ask her to leave.

36
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,910
Mrs. Zhou, please forgive her.

37
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,990
For what? Ask her to leave.

38
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,270
Aren't you leaving?

39
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,150
Sorry to bother you.

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,150
My Lord. Rest early.

41
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,630
-I can finally relax...
-Shush.

42
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,110
The walls have ears.

43
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,430
There're people outside keeping watch.

44
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:46,750
My Lord.

45
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:49,590
Are they going to guard outside all night?

46
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,310
My Lord.

47
00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:55,750
Are they

48
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,670
still out there?

49
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,270
Yes.

50
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:01,110
Well...

51
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,350
How about...

52
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,030
We...

53
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,630
Pretend?

54
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,590
Help me.

55
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:44,950
You're awake.

56
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:46,460
My Lord.

57
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:48,390
Wake up.

58
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,990
We need to be more vigilant today.

59
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:51,270
You also need to keep an eye on your se...

60
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,430
Cousin.

61
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:00,390
My Lord.

62
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,870
The maids take turns to monitor them around the clock.

63
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:05,390
They didn't notice anything unusual between Mr. and Mrs. Zhou.

64
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:09,830
Nothing unusual?

65
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:14,230
Then let's create some issues for them.

66
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:17,120
Yes.

67
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,670
We need to find a chance

68
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:30,990
to get in touch with Lord Su.

69
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,110
Mr. Liang, what's wrong?

70
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:37,909
Do you have something to say?

71
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:38,950
Yes.

72
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,190
We have to get in touch with them.

73
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,110
I wonder

74
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,550
how it went with Wan last night.

75
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,070
Last night, they...

76
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,670
Forget it. It's fine.

77
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,510
Just say it.

78
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:00,550
I just want to know

79
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,040
whether the two of them

80
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,190
slept in the same room last night.

81
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,510
I think so...

82
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,750
I don't think so.

83
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,630
Why are you

84
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:11,590
being ambiguous?

85
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,270
They didn't.

86
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,310
How did you know?

87
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,870
They have just been acting.

88
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,070
Don't take it too seriously.

89
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:21,630
That's right.

90
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:22,150
That's right.

91
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,150
You're right.

92
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,020
They have just been acting.

93
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:26,910
Eat this.

94
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,670
Lords. Please enjoy.

95
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:38,190
Did Mr. and Mrs. Zhou get up?

96
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,470
They just got up.

97
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:41,070
Why did they get up so late?

98
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:42,310
They were intimate all night

99
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,350
and only went to sleep at daybreak.

100
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,750
Of course, they're tired.

101
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,950
Cousin.

102
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:55,120
What are you doing, Cousin?

103
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,230
I want to take you away.

104
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,550
Let go.

105
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,430
Calm down.

106
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,030
You'll get caught.

107
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,030
So what?

108
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,030
I regret it.

109
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,590
I can't let you be with him.

110
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,260
Cousin, what are you talking about?

111
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,430
What did I say?

112
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,590
We were engaged.

113
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:11,310
Cousin.

114
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,310
That was a joke from childhood.

115
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,670
How can you take it seriously?

116
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,190
Wan. You and I...

117
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:18,670
Wan.

118
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,600
We grew up together.

119
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:21,750
Is our relationship over the years

120
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:22,590
all fake?

121
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,190
Of course, it's not.

122
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,390
But that's familial love,

123
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:27,990
sibling affection.

124
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:29,350
It's not romantic love between men and women.

125
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,030
What about you and Zhou Yipu?

126
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:34,430
Me and Lord Zhou...

127
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,670
You clearly told me

128
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,310
that there was no love between you and Zhou Yipu.

129
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,590
You were forced by him.

130
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,070
Cousin,

131
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:42,990
I lied to you

132
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,510
so that you wouldn't be sad.

133
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,190
Lord Zhou and I

134
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,590
love each other.

135
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,750
We promised to be together forever.

136
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:50,990
In this life,

137
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:52,990
I only love him.

138
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:55,230
After we arrive at Zhang's Mansion,

139
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,470
Zhang Ren may have doubts about your relationship

140
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,830
with Lin Wanqing.

141
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,190
Once we enter the mansion,

142
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,750
we must do everything we can

143
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:02,950
to clear his suspicion.

144
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,350
Easier said than done.

145
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,560
What is the right opportunity?

146
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:08,910
If he takes action first,

147
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,390
he'll give us an excellent opportunity.

148
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,950
But how should we dispel his doubts?

149
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,750
Mix truth

150
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:15,750
and lies.

151
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,870
Brother Zhou, I’m really sorry.

152
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,950
I have something urgent to do.

153
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,230
I need to leave for a while.

154
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:37,950
Brother Zhou, help yourself.

155
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:52,870
Didn't I explain everything to you?

156
00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:54,150
What about you and Zhou Yipu?

157
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,190
Me and Lord Zhou...

158
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:56,990
Cousin.

159
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,230
Stop messing around.

160
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,750
I must make it clear to him today.

161
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:01,750
How dare you!

162
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:02,950
How can you act like that

163
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:03,950
in public?

164
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,350
Honey.

165
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:06,230
Cousin.

166
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:07,870
Let's talk inside.

167
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,990
It's not good for others to see us like this.

168
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,110
My Lord.

169
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,000
How is it?

170
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:23,910
He should have temporarily dispelled

171
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,120
his doubts about Liang Weiping.

172
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,070
Great.

173
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:30,190
Tell me.

174
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,060
Is what's between you two real or fake?
