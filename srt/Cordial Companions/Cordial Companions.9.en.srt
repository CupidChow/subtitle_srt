00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,330
[Episode 9]

4
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:41,630
I didn't expect

5
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:42,880
it was Prince Liang.

6
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:44,960
No wonder I couldn't figure out

7
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:46,310
where the short sword came from.

8
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,590
Prince Liang has never been favored by His Majesty since childhood.

9
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,990
Therefore, he rarely participates in politics.

10
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,670
This time, not only was he involved in He De's corruption case,

11
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:54,910
but he also sent someone to kill me.

12
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,030
There must be a bigger conspiracy behind this.

13
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:57,710
Lai Luo.

14
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,280
Keep an eye on him.

15
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,030
I want to know all his movements.

16
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:02,790
My Lord,

17
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:04,069
what's our plan

18
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:05,269
next?

19
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:06,430
Next,

20
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:08,270
we need to make Prince Liang believe in my death.

21
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:13,430
You guys don't try to lock me up.

22
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:16,070
Guard Lin, your reactions

23
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,830
are sometimes fast and sometimes slow.

24
00:01:18,789 --> 00:01:20,190
Guard Lin is smart.

25
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:21,950
She's just timid.

26
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,550
Thanks to Lai Luo's presence.

27
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:26,310
Otherwise, I wouldn't know what to do.

28
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:29,190
We need to find

29
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,870
a hiding place that Prince Liang

30
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:32,509
has never considered.

31
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:34,150
My Lord.

32
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:35,470
The most

33
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,190
dangerous place

34
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:38,630
is always the safest.

35
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:39,350
How about

36
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:40,710
the Supreme Court?

37
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:41,789
Silly.

38
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:44,830
You want to be checked by  Prince Liang's men every day?

39
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:46,630
We have so many guards.

40
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:47,550
What is there to be afraid of?

41
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:48,910
Silly.

42
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:49,990
How can I investigate the case

43
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:50,910
without the freedom to come in and out every day?

44
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:52,990
In my opinion,

45
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,590
we can't hide this for long.

46
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,110
We should plan early

47
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:56,990
how to investigate

48
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:57,870
and collect evidence.

49
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,190
If we wait until Prince Liang finds out,

50
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:00,560
we'll be at a disadvantage.

51
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,630
Lai Luo has a point.

52
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:06,790
Where should we hide then?

53
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:08,990
I have a place

54
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:11,830
that many people don't know.

55
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:16,070

56
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,390
My Lord, please come in.

57
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:24,390
My Lord, welcome to Miduoduo Escort Agency.

58
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,350
Lower your voice.

59
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:26,590
Do you want the whole world to know?

60
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,120
Ye Qing, you stay in the Supreme Court.

61
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,510
Report to me if anything happens.

62
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:31,070
Yes.

63
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:32,510
Lai Luo, you're good at fighting.

64
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:33,710
You keep an eye on Prince Liang's Mansion.

65
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:34,590
Besides,

66
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,990
arrange my fake death.

67
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,230
Make sure not to reveal any clues.

68
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:37,870
Okay.

69
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,070
I'll hide here with Lin Wanqing for now.

70
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:45,870
My Lord.

71
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,390
Although the conditions here are simple,

72
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,310
it’s the best room at Miduoduo.

73
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:51,590
You can stay in this room.

74
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,510
They treat you well.

75
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,990
I was an orphan.

76
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:00,470
My master took me in when I was four.

77
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,110
He treated me like his own daughter.

78
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,990
Senior cared about me even more.

79
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,070
What about your biological parents?

80
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,830
I don't know.

81
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:16,030
My Lord.

82
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,670
I've been an orphan since I was young.

83
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:18,670
That handkerchief

84
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:19,950
is really important to me.

85
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,590
It's the only thing my parents left me.

86
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:24,750
In this case,

87
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,990
I misunderstood her.

88
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,350
It's my handkerchief.

89
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,030
Now it's returned to its owner.

90
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,350
My Lord, did you refuse to give it to me on purpose?

91
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,190
My Lord, why did you do that?

92
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,030
Why are you angry?

93
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,670
You can stay in this room.

94
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:52,550
I don't want to.

98
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,950
I heard from Xiao Ba

99
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:25,870
that he will escort Zhou Yipu

100
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:26,750
to Hongzhou tomorrow.

101
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,150
Why is Zhou Yipu going to Hongzhou?

102
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,030
Where in Hongzhou are they going?

103
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:34,350
To a place called Xinxiu Tea Club.

104
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:36,150
Someone will contact them.

105
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,590
How many of them?

106
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,070
Zhou Yipu,

107
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,350
his newly married wife,

108

109

and a servant.

110
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:43,750
There are four of them.

111
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,670
Looks like we need to go to Hongzhou.

113
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:52,350
Keep an eye on Zhou Yipu's every move.

114
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:52,830
Yes.

115
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,990
What about Guard Lin?

116
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,950
I have a bold idea.

117
00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:01,190
What?

118
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,580
He left

119
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,230
without saying goodbye.

120
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:06,510
He's heartless

121
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:07,870
and unfaithful.

122
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:10,670
It seems

123
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,470
Guard Lin can't bear to part with Lord Su.

124

That's not true.

Of course,

00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,670
if you don't want to help,

133
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,510
I can find someone else.

134
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:39,150
Someone else?

135
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,670

138
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,870
I will certainly help you.

139
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,230
Certainly.

I've completed the task you assigned.

145

Please spare my life.

146
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,190
Fine.

00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,950

Take Zhou Yipu and Xiao Ba

150

to the capital and secretly lock them up.

151
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,430
We'll decide when I'm back.

152
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,630
Also,

153
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:23,870

154
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,190

Yes, My Lord.

00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,030
But this time,

00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:35,150
you'll devote your body for the case.

159

What?

161
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:38,870

Okay.

170
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:15,870
Are we going to live in the same room?

171
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,950
We are husband and wife now.

172
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,110
Of course, we should stay in the same room.

173
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:25,030
What?

174
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,670
Are you afraid I might have ulterior motives against you?

175
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:28,910
Or

176
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,710
what you said yesterday was a lie?

177
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,870
How is that possible?

178
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:37,220

Why would I be scared?

00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:15,910
Then

188
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,310
