[Episode 6]

4
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:49,470
Why haven't you delivered the food yet?

5
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:50,470
I...

6
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:54,230
Alright, alright.

7
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:54,910
No need to say it.

8
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,790
I've sensed it.

9
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:57,790
You...

10
00:00:58,190 --> 00:00:59,750
You've sensed it?

11
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:03,390
You're in conflict with His Lordship, right?

12
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:09,190
It's impossible that a young girl like you can hide

13
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:10,630
what you think from me.

14
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:11,870
Ma'am,

15
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:13,350
you misunderstood.

16
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:16,590
I used to have the same experience.

17
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:17,480
You don't

18
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,670
have to be shy in front of me anymore.

19
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:21,590
When two people are in a romantic relationship,

20
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:23,430
it's inevitable to meet some problems.

21
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:26,110
What matters is how to solve the problems.

22
00:01:26,789 --> 00:01:28,350
Lord Su

23
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:29,830
looks indifferent and cool.

24
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,710
And Ye Qing, who works by his side,

25
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:34,390
is even more unreliable.

26
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:35,789
But it's okay.

27
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:37,190
You have me.

28
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:40,030
Ma'am.

29
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:42,070
You've really thought too much.

30
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,590
Of course not.

31
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:44,830
Let me tell you.

32
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:46,229
According to my experience,

33
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:47,910
the worst thing to do

34
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:48,470
is delaying.

35
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,030
The longer you delay,

36
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,229
the more serious the problem will be.

37
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:52,630
Let me tell you.

38
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:55,039
Don't give him the silent treatment.

39
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,310
The longer I delay, the more serious the problem will be.

40
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:00,190
Right.

41
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:01,550
I can't talk to you now.

42
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:02,340
I have to go.

43
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:09,520
Miss Lin.

44
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,669
You're finally here.

45
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:11,710
Come in at once.

46
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,430
His Lordship has been waiting for you for a long time.

47
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,110
Go.

48
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:33,230
My Lord.

49
00:02:33,829 --> 00:02:35,150
Please enjoy the meal.

50
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,630
Well, My Lord,

51
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,950
the food is getting cold.

52
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,190
Remember to eat it.

53
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:47,670
Is she showing

54
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:48,750
concern for me?

55
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,300
Alright.

56
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,990
What is this?

57
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,910
This dish wasn't made by me.

58
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:17,870
How was it?

59
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:20,150
Have you made up with Lord Su?

60
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:22,750
What you did would make Lord Su misunderstand.

61
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,829
Misunderstand?

62
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,829
What will he misunderstand?

63
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,630
That dish wasn't made by me at all.

64
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,270
So that's what you're worried about.

65
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,190
Don't worry.

66
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,120
He won't misunderstand it.

67
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,470
You delivered the food, so it means you made it.

68
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:34,829
I delivered the food,

69
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,280
so it means I made it?

70
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,110
Yes.

71
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,710
In other words,

72
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,870
if he dies of poisoning after eating the food

73
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:43,829
delivered by me,

74
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:46,630
I'll be treated as the person who poisoned him,

75
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,950
and I'll be put into prison again, right?

76
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,460
That's not okay.

77
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,520
I have to make things clear to Lord Su.

78
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,570
Why isn't Lord Su in his room?

79
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:01,900
Bring the water into the room for me.

80
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:04,670
What should I do?

81
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,800
Will I be misunderstood again?

Understood?

00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:41,390
I was imprudent.
