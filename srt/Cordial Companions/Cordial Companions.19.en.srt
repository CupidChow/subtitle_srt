00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:45,230
Let's go.

5
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:55,960
My Lord,

6
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,150
Su Moyi and the others poisoned the guards

7
00:00:58,190 --> 00:00:59,390
and have escaped from the city.

8
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:03,390
Good.

9
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:07,070
They may disguise as guards

10
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,390
to find a chance to leave the city.

11
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:12,630
Let's play along with them.

12
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,110
You mean...

13
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,400
Instead of trying our best to catch them,

14
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,230
we can get well prepared and wait for them

15
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,150
to let their guard down.

16
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:25,670
Then we can catch them unexpectedly.

17
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:47,950
My Lord,

18
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,750
why do I feel something is wrong?

19
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,150
What's wrong?

20
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:53,000
To be on the safe side,

21
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:55,039
I specially put the medicine that causes abdominal pain in the porridge just now.

22
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:55,830
But...

23
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:57,190
But when the guards fell down,

24
00:01:57,229 --> 00:01:58,830
they didn't have abdominal pain.

25
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:00,030
Not bad.

26
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,430
You are quick on the draw this time.

27
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:02,670
It's not a big deal.

28
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,790
Everyone must be very careful.

29
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:05,830
Let's find some horses

30
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:06,950
and go back to the capital immediately.

31
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:08,350
Let's go.

32
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,390
You have to go back to the Supreme Court as fast as you can.

33
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,270
You have to inform Wei Wen.

34
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:21,750
No.

35
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:23,190
My Lord, we should leave together.

36
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,590
You have to stop Prince Liang's plan.

37
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,150
I believe you.

38
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,350
You can do it.

39
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:32,310
Kill them!

40
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:45,310
Go!

41
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:47,630
Go now!

42
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,670
It'll be too late if you don't leave now.

43
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,390
My Lord,

44
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,750
you must come back safely.

45
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:51,430
We promise you.

46
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,310
We will come back safely.

47
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:52,910
Go now!

48
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,430
Report!

49
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:07,430

50
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,550

51
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:10,630

Your Majesty.

54
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:33,990
Your Majesty!

55
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,350
Bad news!

56
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:37,990
What's wrong?

57
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:40,070
Prince Liang has colluded with Jinwu Guards to start a rebellion.

58
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:42,350
Now the whole imperial city has been surrounded.

59
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:45,350
Now?

60
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,230
Yes.

61
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:47,030
Your Majesty,

62
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:49,230
we'd better retreat to a safe place.

63
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,390
You want to escape?

64
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,280
Escape?

65
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,230
Father,

66
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,830
where do you want to go?

67
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,400
Son,

68
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:11,030
you are quite bold.

69
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,630
Unfortunately,

70
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,430
you are not capable enough.

71
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,560
Do you think

72
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,350
you can really replace me?

73
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,710
Father, you are so calm.

74
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:31,830
It turns out you've been well prepared.

75
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:33,790
However,

76
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:37,310
I'm not interested in your position at all.

77
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,740
Then what do you want?

78
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,670
You'll know

79
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,790
what I want later.

80
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,830
I've prepared

81
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,710
a big gift for you.

82
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,990
It will definitely surprise you.

83
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,710

84
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,310
what your big gift

85
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,950
is.

It looks like

90
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,670
I should give you a surprise.

91
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:39,670
Come out.

92
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:48,510

93
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:50,790
Why are you here?

96
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:59,070
Good for you, Su Moyi.

97
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:02,150
So it was you.

98

Lord Su

99
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,350

brave,

101

Of course,

103
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,310
His Majesty is wise

104
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,150
and trusts him.

105
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,670
Prince Liang,

106
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:23,030
I really didn't expect

107
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,870
that you would sacrifice all the civilians

108
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,790
in the capital

109
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:29,070
for your own benefits.

110
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,510
This is all because of you.

111
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,150
Do you remember?

112
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:34,670
When I was a kid,

113
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,750
I learned a set of new swordsmanship.

114
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:39,870
You didn't support me,

115
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,270
and you even scolded my master and wouldn't let me learn.

116
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:44,470
On the anniversary of my mother's death,

117
00:06:44,909 --> 00:06:46,240
you even scolded me

118
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,630
for mourning her with lotuses.

119
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,909
And you didn't allow me to enter the Imperial Study.

120
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:52,360
You did all that.

121
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,870
My mother didn't have a decent family background.

122
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,630
But do I deserve

123
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:59,430
your indifference, contempt, and trample just because of that?

124
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:04,270
I have allowed you to live in this world.

125
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:07,310
You should be grateful

126
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,430
and content.

127
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:10,790
Do you know

128
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:11,590
when I

129
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:14,070
was reviewing the memorials,

130
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,990
your mother

131
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,950
came in with dim sum

132
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:20,670
and tried to kill me with a dagger

133
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,630
when I was off guard?

134
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,110
No.

135
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,870
This is all your nonsense.

136
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,110
Believe it

137
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:30,710
or not.

138
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,630
You will pay

139
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,390
for what you did.

140
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,630
Imperial Guards, Jinwu Guards, listen.

141
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:41,950
Prince Liang

142
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,909
started a rebellion and committed treason.

143
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:48,310
I order you to arrest him immediately.

144
00:07:58,870 --> 00:07:59,870
Father,

145
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,910
you didn't expect this, right?

146
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,230
Since you and I

147
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,910
are father and son,

148
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,190
I will spare your life.

149
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:15,430
You just need to kneel, beg for forgiveness, and apologize.

150
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,230
That's ridiculous.

151
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:22,860
Stop dreaming.

152
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,910
Then don't blame me for being merciless.

153
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,429
Everyone, listen.

154
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:33,350
Yes.

155
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,510
Kill them!

156
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:47,790
Don't move!

157
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:48,910
Let her go.

158
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,150
I can let her go.

159
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,510
Go kill that old man.

160
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,150
You...

161
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,630
You're crazy.

162
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:59,390
I am crazy.

163
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:02,030
Don't you want to know what Su Moyi's choice is?

164
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,590
I don't.

165
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,190
Su Moyi,

166
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:11,470
it's up to you.

167
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:14,670
Stop!

168
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,030
I'm willing to trade my life for her life.

169
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,870
Looks like you're an affectionate man.

170
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,000
Fine.

171
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:28,020
I'm giving you this chance.

172
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,080
How can you guarantee that you won't go back on your word?

173
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:31,870
Su Moyi,

174
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,350
who are you to bargain with me?

175
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:39,030
Now, I'm gonna count down from three.

176
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:41,590
Three.

177
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:42,360
My Lord!

178
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:48,590
My Lord, no! My Lord!
