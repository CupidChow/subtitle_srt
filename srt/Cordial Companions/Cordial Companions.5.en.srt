[Episode 5]

4
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:45,900
Lai Luo.

5
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,130
Look. There are lantern riddles ahead.

6
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:50,190
How about we go play the game of solving lantern riddles?

7
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:51,120
Solving lantern riddles?

8
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,510
Let's focus on our work first.

9
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:56,410
Lai Luo, it's fine.

10
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,350
If you want to play anything else,

11
00:00:58,430 --> 00:00:59,680
I can also play it with you.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,650
You?

13
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:02,710
Don't underestimate me.

14
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,610
I'm very good.

15
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:28,640
-Bravo! -Bravo! -Bravo!

16
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:31,150
-Bravo! -Bravo! -Bravo!

17
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:32,080
That's really good.

18
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,370
He's dead.

19
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:38,420
Is she going to ask me to play this?

20
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:39,430
My Lord.

21
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:40,440
Help!

22
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,800
How come it seems that everyone has a companion?

23
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,270
I'm the one only who is alone.

24
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:50,420
Master.

25
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,960
How are you in Heaven?

26
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,259
And Senior Liang.

27
00:01:55,789 --> 00:01:57,690
I haven't heard any news about you for half a year.

28
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:59,500
Where on earth are you?

29
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,980
I hope that our master can bless you as a soul in Heaven

30
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,470
so that you will be safe.

31
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,770
Miss, please stop.

32
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,509
I'm sorry to bother you.

33
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,289
May I have the honor

34
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:11,380
to invite you to walk around here with me?

35
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,720
Miss, don't be nervous.

36
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,060
I mean no harm.

37
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:18,010
I just saw that the atmosphere of the Lantern Festival was very lively,

38
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,780
but you were alone

39
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,120
and seemed a little lonely.

40
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,810
Who said that she was alone?

41
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:37,030
Why are you crying?

42
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,450
Nothing.

43
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:40,020
There's no reason for me to cry.

44
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,600
If there's no reason, how come you're crying now?

45
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,090
I'm not crying.

46
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,170
Do you think that I ruined your date with that man?

47
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,290
My Lord.

48
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:56,540
Thank you.

49
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,079
For what?

50
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:01,920
Nothing.

51
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,490
If there's nothing, why are you thanking me?

52
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,390
Well,

53
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,650
aren't you busy with work?

54
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,230
Why did you come here suddenly?

55
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:12,140
Well,

56
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,670
I'm here to inspect

57
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:14,880
the security tonight.

58
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,010
It's more reassuring for me to do this.

59
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,530
I see.

60
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,790
Where are Ye Qing and Lai Luo?

61
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:23,120
Why aren't they with you?

62
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:25,260
He went to watch a performance.

63
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,480
He's over there.

64
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,050
Be careful!

65
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:39,890
Well,

66
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:40,900
Lord Su,

67
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,360
I suddenly want to eat ice jelly.

68
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,020
I'll go buy some.

69
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,430
Wait for me here.

70
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,590
How can you jump the line?

71
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,080
Shut up if you don't want to die.

72
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:13,660
Come with me.

73
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:20,240
You...

74
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,529
What do you want to do?

75
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,650
Not bad.

76
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:25,940
No wonder Su Moyi

77
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,350
was tricked so easily.

78
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,210
Who are you?

79
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:41,490
What did you force me to drink just now?

80
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:42,620
Poison.

81
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,560
You won't die so soon.

82
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:48,159
What is this now?

83
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,130
You need to make Su Moyi

84
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,159
drink this bottle of poison in three days

85
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:55,100
in order to exchange his life

86
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:56,640
for your life.

87
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:08,390
Let's go.

88
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,500
What should I do now?

89
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,520
If it weren't for Lord Su,

90
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,990
I wouldn't have lived till now.

91
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,200
But...

92
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,580
But I don't want to die, either.

93
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,380
Ice jelly for sale!

94
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,400
Ice jelly.

95
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:35,780
Delicious ice jelly.

96
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,260
Miss, have a bowl of ice jelly.

97
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:41,680
Sir.

98
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,970
Give me a bowl of ice jelly.

99
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:43,540
Okay.

100
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,190
Your ice jelly.

101
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,320
Six copper coins.

102
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:50,850
Thank you.

103
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,190
[May the country be prosperous and the people live in peace. May the land yield good harvests and the people enjoy good health.]

104
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,370
My Lord.

105
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:16,220
Where did you go?

106
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,840
My Lord, were you looking for me?

107
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,030
I'm sorry.

108
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,970
It took me a long time to wait in line just now,

109
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:27,040
so I'm late.

110
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:28,820
Taste it now.

111
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,160
No.

112
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,090
Have you eaten ice jelly?

113
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,750
Yes, I have.

114
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,610
I bought this specially for you.

115
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,630
Did you

116
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,159
only go to buy ice jelly just now?

117
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,080
Excuse me. Excuse me.

118
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:49,380
Let me get over the shock.

119
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,570
It smells so good.

120
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,280
I should find a better chance.

121
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,500
[Supreme Court]

122
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,110
Favorable climatic conditions.

123
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:34,140
I'm so hungry.

124
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:34,870
Well...

125
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,180
Why hasn't the food been delivered here yet?

126
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,050
Favorable environmental conditions.

127
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:48,440
Go now.

128
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,770
Don't keep His Lordship waiting.

129
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,159
Favorable interpersonal relationships.

130
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:57,210
The chance has been given to me directly.

131
00:07:57,409 --> 00:07:59,950
This is forcing me to poison him and commit a crime.

132
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,490
But...

133
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:05,450
[Supreme Court]

134
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,510
I still can't do it.

135
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,770
Why haven't you delivered the food yet?

136
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:22,780
I...

137
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,530
Alright, alright.

138
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:27,220
No need to say it.

139
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,120
I've sensed it.
