Do you know who Su Moyi is?

00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,710
He's from an aristocratic family.

13
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:02,790
He became famous at a young age.

14
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:05,200
He is well-versed in both literature and martial arts. 
He succeeded in the Imperial Examinations the first time to participate in them.

He's meticulous

It's only been a few years since he went to work in the Supreme Court,

that I was an accomplice who helped to kill He De.

51
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,430
That's why you let me go deliberately.

52

before I came to the Supreme Court,

I did receive the task to kill He De.

57

But after I came here,

58
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:22,510
the idea of killing him never occurred to me.

59
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,710
I don't dare to kill people.

60
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,070
Nor do I want to be killed.

61
