4
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,670
My Lord, you're finally awake.

5
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:45,910
All right.

6
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:46,550
Don't cry.

7
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:48,790
I can't help it.

8
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:53,200
It's all my fault.

9
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,630
If I could dodge that arrow,

10
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:58,350
perhaps you wouldn't have gotten hurt.

11
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:01,470
I regret it so much.

12
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:02,630
Regret what?

13
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:05,870
I regret coming to Hongzhou with you.

14
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:07,370
♫Frost, snow, and bright sky are pure in the wind♫

15
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,910
If someone else

16
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,720
♫Flowers and butterflies come and go, but they don't understand my delicate heart♫

17
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:10,190
instead of me

18
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:11,430
came to Hongzhou with you,

19
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,030
you wouldn't have gotten hurt.

20
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:18,400
♫That year, we welcomed spring, and snow melted♫

21
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:15,750
Indeed.

22
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,230
You're indeed stupid.

23
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,520
♫I miss your tenderness very much♫

24
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,390

♫Begonias become red and we'll meet someday♫

26
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:25,230
No one else.

27
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,230
Why aren't you saying anything?

28
00:01:29,539 --> 00:01:34,440
♫Fishing alone in the dim moonlight♫

29
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:33,229
My Lord, do you still know who you are?

30
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:39,050
♫You don't know that the autumn river flows like a dream♫

31
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:36,950
Your senior was right about one thing.

32
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,110
I brought you to Hongzhou for business.

33
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,550
But it's also for my selfish intention.

34
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:45,740
♫I only wish I could stay in your eyes♫

35
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:42,670

whenever I'm with you,

37
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:46,030
I'm just Su Moyi.

38

♫Walking with you and enjoying the bright moon in the clear sky♫

39
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,310
I know

40
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,840
♫The night is yet young and the lanterns are warm like the sun♫

41
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,590
your feelings.

♫Thousands of miles of mountains and rivers are tender and gentle♫

43
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:00,510
Why are you laughing?

44
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:02,630
I saw you close your eyes.

45
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,360
♫I waited until my love was ripe like a fruit on the branch♫

46

♫Flowers are blooming again and have always been in my dreams♫

00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:27,950
Why don't we do it

53
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,950
till you get better?

54
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,110
Stop.

55
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:54,670
Lai Luo,

56
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,670
just let me see the lord.

57
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,670
I'm not by his side.

58
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,190
I'm really worried.

59
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,960
I'm worried about him too.

60
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,110
But he needs to rest now.

61
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,670
I'll just guard here.

62
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:05,270
Well.

63
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,990
But... But this is a special situation.

64
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:22,470
I'm sorry.

65
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:23,910
I won't do it again. I won't.

66
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:25,430
I won't.

67
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,630
What happened to your hand?

68
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,110
A wound is a symbol of men.

69
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,110
Shut up.

70
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:58,710
Lai Luo,

71
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,280
this is the first time that you're so gentle to me.

72
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,430
Just this once.

73
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,520
Don't be so reckless again.

74
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,670
I got hurt to save you.

75
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:17,070
If it were someone else,

76
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:17,910
I wouldn't have cared.

77
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,190
You are helpful to me

78
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,510
just by protecting yourself.

79
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:29,510
Lai Luo,

80
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,500
do you think

81
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,040
I'm useless?

82
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:37,990
If you're useless,

83
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:39,710
why would the lord let you

84
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,110
always stay by his side?

85
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:43,430
Really?

86
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,830
Do you really think so?

87
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,190
I can't believe it.

88
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:52,830
Unless

89
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,790
you promise me something.

90
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,030
Believe it or not.

91
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,230
Lai Luo,

92
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:02,030
I got hurt for you.

93
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:05,110
Tell me.

94
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,030
What is it?

95
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,550
Accept this bracelet.

96
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,950
If you don't say anything,

97
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,070
I'll take it as a yes.

98
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,350
You two really don't treat me as an outsider.

99
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,420
My Lord.

100
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,710
Lord Zhou is fine now.

101
00:05:58,950 --> 00:05:59,920
I didn't expect

102
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,670
that Zhou Yipu really doesn't know martial arts.

103
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:06,110
I can't believe I was wrong.

104
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:09,390
How should we explain to Prince Liang later

105
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:10,990
about what happened at Hongzhou's fair?

106
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:12,830
We know

107
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,030
what Prince Liang is capable of.

108
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,470
What a headache.

109
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:39,310
My Lord,

110
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:40,909
watch your wound.

111
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,390
Don't worry.

112
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:44,820
It was personal.

113
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,950
It's business now.

114
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,350
Someone is watching us on the outside.

115
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,670
Mr. Zhou, you're awake.

116
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,710
Well... How is your wound?

117
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,470
It's fine.

118
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:09,630
Mr. Zhou, don't worry.

119
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:12,310
The person who shot you has been caught.

120
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,600
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

121
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:24,310
Mr. Zhang,

122
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:26,190
I really don't understand.

123
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,190
We are new here in Hongzhou.

124
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:30,150
Why were we ambushed and attacked?

125
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,270
It's all my fault.

126
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,550
I'm sorry, Mr. Zhou.

127
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:35,790
What do you mean?

128
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,950
Mr. Zhou, there is something you don't know.

129
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,350
Hongzhou

130
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:41,270
is not like the capital,

131
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,710
where the emperor lives.

132
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,070
The local villains here

133
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,310
disregard the law and discipline.

134
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:46,550
And they are arrogant and domineering.

135
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:47,909
I left the mansion a few days ago

136
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,710
to deal with them.

137
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,590
They

138
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,870
came to take revenge on me.

139
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,390
Coincidentally,

140
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,590
you went out from my mansion.

141
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:58,550
So...

142
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,150
I can't believe it.

143
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,750
Luckily, you are fine.

144
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,630
Otherwise, how should I explain to His Highness?

145
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,430
Mr. Zhou,

146
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,150
can you go to the mine tomorrow?

147
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:10,830
If you can't,

148
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:13,190
I'll ask someone to take the ore back.

149
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:16,390
It's fine.

150
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,550
I have to be very cautious, since it's His Highness's order.

151
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:21,070
It's better to go to the mine.

152
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,310
Mr. Zhou is so loyal.

153
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,750
Success will definitely be achieved.

154
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,110
My Lord,

155
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:50,310
everything is normal.

156
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:26,030
Wait. Wait.

157
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:29,870
What's wrong?

158
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,150
My Lord,

159
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:32,600
you haven't recovered.

160
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:33,870
I'm worried.

161
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,790
I want to go with you.

162
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:38,470
The love between Madam and Mr. Zhou

163
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:39,660
really makes me envious.

164
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:43,150
You can just rest in Mr. Zhang's mansion.

165
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:44,550
I'll be right back.

166
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,830
Come back as soon as you finish your work.

167
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:48,510
Okay.

168
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,350
No problem.

169
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,030
Let's go, Mr. Zhou.

170
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,070
Please.
