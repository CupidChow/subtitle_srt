1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Listen to consecrated mutation.

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

3
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

4
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

5
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

6
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

7
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

8
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

9
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

10
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

11
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

12
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

13
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

14
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

15
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The Legend of Chusen

16
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Episode 2

17
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yesterday, I called you all day and you didn't pick up my call.

18
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I was there.

19
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
But you were in the hospital.

20
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
They are now going to sue me for hitting the son of Han Kuilong and leaving without a word.

21
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
What do you think we should do?

22
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You just go and go.

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Did you find that white Benchi?

24
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I went.

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
But they burned the car last night.

26
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
What about Xiaobei?

27
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Did you talk to her?

28
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I couldn't find her.

29
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
She might be too scared to hide.

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
The police might sue you for escaping responsibility.

31
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So if you have any evidence that can help you,

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
don't hide it anymore.

33
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Can I transfer the evidence?

34
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I don't know what you're afraid of.

35
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
But if you can provide clues to the case and get the agreement with the控方,

36
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I can ask for special protection.

37
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
They can't protect me here.

38
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Unless I can leave.

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
The whole family can leave together.

40
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
As long as I'm in Haogang for one day,

41
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I can't say anything.

42
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm sorry.

43
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Lao Wen.

44
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I just saw Ma Shanbao.

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
He wants to talk to the控方.

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
He wants to admit he stole the car?

47
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
He wants to transfer the evidence.

48
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Who does he want to testify?

49
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
As long as he can provide enough protection for his family and him,

50
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
he will tell the truth.

51
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
What truth?

52
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
He will tell the truth about the man who hit Han Gang.

53
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
So he didn't tell you who the murderer was?

54
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Ma Shanbao is very scared now.

55
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
He doesn't believe anyone, including me.

56
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Then why do you believe someone who doesn't believe you?

57
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Because I have confidence in Ma Shanbao.

58
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I know he wants to talk about someone

59
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
who is not a big deal to everyone.

60
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
That's why he's so scared.

61
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Qi Changlong?

62
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I don't know.

63
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
But if it's him, I don't think it's an accident.

64
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Who is the chief judge?

65
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Zhang Jian. Zhang Songshan.

66
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Zhang Songshan.

67
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Zhang Songshan is from the old city district.

68
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
This will be his weakness.

69
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You mean...

70
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
People in the old city district never want to cooperate with the police.

71
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
When did you see a witness from the old city district?

72
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Tell him that

73
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
he will have to pay three years' living expenses to his family

74
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
and help Ma Shanbao immigrate to Canada.

75
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Will Zhang Jian accept this?

76
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Does this have anything to do with the old city district?

77
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You have such a big condition.

78
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
He will believe that there is a big tiger behind you.

79
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
That's why he has this value.

80
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
If Zhang Songshan really became a prosecutor,

81
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
he will tell others that

82
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
the old city district can have a prosecutor like this.

83
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
But will Zhang Jian believe me?

84
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Only because the newcomers have this condition

85
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
will they believe in his value.

86
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So my next step is to make Zhang Jian believe

87
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
that if Ma Shanbao tells the truth,

88
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
he must accept his condition.

89
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
This is a golden opportunity.

90
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's the only way to help Ma Shanbao.

91
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Thank you, Master.

92
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Hurry up!

93
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Hurry up!

94
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Stop the car!

95
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Hello?

96
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Luo Wei,

97
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
are you really welcoming your good friend like this?

98
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Madam,

99
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Lawyer Zhou is here.

100
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Sit.

101
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Didn't you insist that your client wasn't here?

102
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Isn't Zhang Jian here yet?

103
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Didn't we meet at 11?

104
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Zhang Jian just called.

105
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
He said there was a traffic jam at the court.

106
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You used to be a real leader.

107
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Now you are in this kind of trouble.

108
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You are feeding four people.

109
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Say it quickly.

110
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
How much can this kind of thing earn at a time?

111
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It's not as much as you kill people and set fire.

112
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Yes.

113
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
So, 200,000 is not a small amount for you.

114
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You took out such a big sum of money

115
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It must not be easy.

116
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
A'bao calls you uncle.

117
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Sha Sha and her mother are sisters.

118
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
This is your family business.

119
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
But now Daxiong

120
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
is being played around and killed.

121
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I am their boss.

122
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I have to come out and help my brothers.

123
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I am sorry.

124
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Han Gang is in a coma.

125
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Daxiong is injured.

126
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Han Kuilong and I will fight sooner or later.

127
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
But now there are so many problems.

128
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It's all because of A'bao.

129
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I asked her mother.

130
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
That night you called A'bao out.

131
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Say it.

132
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Why did you call her out?

133
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Where did the 200,000 come from?

134
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Who are you going to cover up?

135
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Don't say it.

136
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It doesn't matter if you don't say it.

137
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
This matter has nothing to do with you.

138
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
What do you want?

139
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
It's simple.

140
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
To kill Han Kuilong,

141
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
it's not enough to just kill a few people and a few guns.

142
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You need some big guys to win.

143
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
For the sake of Sha Sha and her two children,

144
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
just do me a favor.

145
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You have to help yourself.

146
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It's a good idea.

147
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Ms. Zhang, please.

148
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Ms. Zhang.

149
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'm sorry.

150
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
There was a lot of traffic this morning.

151
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It's okay.

152
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Is this Zhou Wenluo?

153
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Please.

154
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
It's Zhou Luo Wen.

155
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Okay, Zhou Lawyer.

156
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Please make time to enter the court.

157
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
My client wants to make a deal.

158
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
He's willing to confess, right?

159
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
He wants to transfer to a false witness.

160
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
But he's the only one who can make a report.

161
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
The police have no direct evidence

162
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
to prove that my client stole a car and caused a traffic accident.

163
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
The court may be able to prove it without any charges

164
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
based on the case's interest.

165
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
But if my client is willing to tell the truth,

166
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
it will save the legal resources

167
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
and benefit both parties.

168
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You insisted that Ma Shanbao wasn't there.

169
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Now you're saying he knows the truth.

170
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
What do you mean?

171
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I can tell you one more thing.

172
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
This car accident

173
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
may not be an accident.

174
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You mean

175
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
the victim was a victim?

176
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I don't rule out this possibility.

177
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
This is the request I made.

178
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
If you agree, he will make a statement.

179
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Oh, he's a big family.

180
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
He's got a family and a living expenses.

181
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Qi Changrong's power

182
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
has been in the Old Town District for a long time,

183
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
but no one has dared to become a false witness.

184
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
The police don't want to cooperate,

185
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
and that's their tradition.

186
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
The唐 Ducha should know about this.

187
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
What can a thief know?

188
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Ma Shanbao grew up in the Old Town District.

189
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
He is Qi Changrong's family.

190
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,200
Ma Shanbao grew up in the old city district.

191
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,200
He is a member of Qi Changrong.

192
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,200
I'm sorry.

193
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,400
Lawyer Zhou, right?

194
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:35,200
I heard you say that you are very familiar with the old city district.

195
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,200
Then do you know

196
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,600
what is the difference between the old city district and Qi Changrong?

197
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,600
This case is your first case of your own independence, right?

198
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,200
I really admire your courage.

199
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,800
But you can't be so greedy, you know?

200
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You think my experience is shallow, but you think I have the ability?

201
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,600
Lawyer Zhou, you can't be so aggressive.

202
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,400
If you open your mouth, you will choke to death.

203
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,200
Zhang Jian, you are also from the old city district.

204
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,200
What? What did you say?

205
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,600
Who said I'm from the old city district?

206
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,600
You are not.

207
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,800
Zhang Jian grew up abroad. He came back after graduation.

208
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,200
My identity shouldn't be part of the negotiation.

209
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,000
I don't think it's necessary to continue talking.

210
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,400
Lawyer Zhou, right?

211
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,400
I'm sorry.

212
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,400
I'll send her out first.

213
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Zhang Jian

214
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Hello, how is it going?

215
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,600
I'm done. Zhang Jian is not from the old city district.

216
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,600
No, you have seen his information.

217
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,400
His parents are all from the old city district. What happened?

218
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,000
He is very sensitive to the old city district.

219
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
He doesn't allow me to continue talking.

220
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,200
Don't be afraid. There must be a way.

221
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,600
The old city district.

222
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,400
You don't know how many years it took me to get rid of this hat.

223
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,000
Zhang Jian doesn't need to argue with the newcomers.

224
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
He transferred five witnesses and even sent his family abroad.

225
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,800
How is he so confident to propose such a condition?

226
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,600
Let's sue him according to the original charge.

227
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,600
Zhang Jian, look at this report first.

228
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,200
What is this?

229
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,400
The DNA report that was tested at the scene.

230
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,000
You are showing me now?

231
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I just received it.

232
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,200
I was going to give it to you as soon as you arrived.

233
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,200
I didn't think that Lawyer Zhou would arrive so early.

234
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,600
There are two DNA samples on this.

235
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,800
They are all the same.

236
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,000
One is from the burglary on the ground.

237
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,160
The other one is from the

238
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,800
I think it was from the real murderer.

239
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,600
He was too nervous to do the case.

240
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,000
Wait.

241
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,200
It's not compatible with Ma Shanbao's DNA?

242
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,600
We really found the wrong person.

243
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,000
And the police have no reason to keep him.

244
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,200
His lawyer doesn't know about this report.

245
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,200
Only we know.

246
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,800
He is still in front of the Tang's Governor.

247
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,200
He is making fun of me.

248
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,000
Do you think he is just trying to sell me out?

249
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,200
It's their usual way to get your confidence.

250
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,800
Did you propose a condition?

251
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,400
Did they respond? What is the bottom line?

252
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:41,400
They didn't say the bottom line. Zhang Jian just refused.

253
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,200
This means Ma Shanbao will continue to stay.

254
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,800
Wait.

255
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,200
Tang's Governor just sent me a message.

256
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,000
He asked me to go back and continue.

257
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,800
Did you ask why?

258
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,000
No.

259
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,800
Remember, unless they agree to all the conditions,

260
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,000
you don't have to talk. Keep your bottom line.

261
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,000
I understand.

262
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,400
I understand.

263
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,800
Lawyer Zhou, you did leave out the topic.

264
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,000
But fortunately, Zhang Jian is reasonable.

265
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
He is willing to give you another chance.

266
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I understand.

267
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,800
I'm sorry.

268
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,600
Enough.

269
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,600
Ma Shanbao's request can be made.

270
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,400
But there is a precondition.

271
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:38,800
I must know how much he will reveal the truth.

272
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,600
Who is the victim?

273
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,000
Because he never mentioned it.

274
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,800
I need to ask for my client's permission before I can answer you.

275
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,800
You can call him now.

276
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,200
I have my own phone number.

277
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,800
I'm sorry.

278
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,000
What do you think?

279
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,200
I believe someone is behind him.

280
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:10,000
It's not like he's a newcomer.

281
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,800
Let's see how capable he is.

282
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,600
I'm sorry.

283
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,800
What?

284
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,400
They want to know who the real murderer is.

285
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,800
This is your bottom line.

286
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,800
If you reveal it too soon, you won't have a bargaining chip.

287
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:35,000
Tell them your client doesn't agree.

288
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,600
I understand.

289
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,400
I'm sorry.

290
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,400
My client doesn't agree.

291
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,000
If I go to the detention center to see him, I can make him agree.

292
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,400
I'll give you one day.

293
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,800
We can talk here at the same time.

294
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,200
I have another request.

295
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,400
What is it?

296
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:22,600
I'll apply to the court to let my client go home and be taken into custody.

297
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,400
You said it's dangerous outside, but it's not safe in the detention center.

298
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,200
My client wants to go home and see his family.

299
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,400
If I satisfy his condition, I can convince him.

300
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:37,800
At the same time, I need Zhang Jian to support my application.

301
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,400
I'll go back and prepare the documents for the court.

302
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,400
Thank you.

303
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,800
This is the only chance to find the real murderer.

304
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,400
Stop the two gangs from fighting.

305
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,400
If you don't mind, Zhang Jian...

306
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,800
I don't mind.

307
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,800
I don't mind.

308
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,000
Do as the procedure says.

309
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Thank you, Zhang Jian.

310
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,600
Okay.

311
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,800
I'm sorry.

312
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,000
Aren't you done with class? Why are you back?

313
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,600
Can we talk?

314
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,800
Psychological counseling...

315
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,400
They can't help me.

316
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,200
I'm sorry. I can't help you either.

317
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,800
Coach.

318
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,800
I know drinking is a problem for you.

319
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:06,800
But I'm really grateful that you were there with me.

320
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,800
I'll give it to you.

321
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,800
I apologize.

322
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,800
No need. Just take care of yourself.

323
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,800
Qi Yingwei!

324
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,800
Qi Changrong knew I was giving money to A'bao,

325
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,800
so he put this matter on my head.

326
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,800
He even threatened me with my wife and child.

327
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,800
He wanted me to help him get a batch of weapons.

328
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,800
You won't agree to it, will you?

329
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,800
Do I have the right to choose?

330
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,800
Is there really no other way?

331
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,800
We have a bigger problem now.

332
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,800
A'bao is going to be a false witness.

333
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,800
Who told you that?

334
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,800
Lawyer Zhao said A'bao hasn't said it yet.

335
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,800
As soon as he says it, he will tell you and me.

336
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:13,800
You have one night to persuade A'bao to change his mind.

337
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,800
A'bao is being held alone now.

338
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,800
I can't even see him. How can I convince him?

339
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,800
We'll let him go later.

340
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,800
We'll accept the police's restraining.

341
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,800
The relationship between the控方 and the court has been agreed.

342
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,800
Tonight is our last chance.

343
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,800
I'll go back and discuss it with my wife.

344
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,800
We're in a lot of trouble.

345
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,800
Don't drag her into this.

346
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,800
What should I do?

347
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,800
If you really find her,

348
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:54,800
tell her that the police don't have any evidence.

349
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,800
As long as she passes this, I can think of a way.

350
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:02,800
Tell her to change her mind when she meets Lawyer Zhao.

351
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,800
And keep her silent.

352
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:10,800
You're afraid that something bad will happen to you.

353
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,800
What am I afraid of?

354
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,800
I don't want to be a suspect.

355
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,800
Even if the police catch someone,

356
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,800
they won't take the suspect away.

357
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,800
I won't let them go to jail.

358
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,800
You're going to run away like this?

359
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,800
You treat your friend like this?

360
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,800
I won't ask you to go to A Bao if I don't treat you like a friend.

361
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,800
I'm helping you and everyone.

362
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,800
Do we have to run away?

363
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,800
It depends on whether you can make A Bao shut up.

364
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,800
You can go home tonight.

365
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,800
Really?

366
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,800
It's the police's house.

367
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,800
But at least you can go home

368
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,800
and see your mother and brother.

369
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,800
I'm going to go.

370
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,800
I'm going to go.

371
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,800
I'm going to go.

372
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,800
I'm going to go.

373
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,800
I'm going to go.

374
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,800
I'm going to go.

375
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,800
What are their conditions?

376
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,800
Who is the real murderer?

377
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,800
What about my requirements?

378
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,800
What about the money?

379
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,800
Where will our family go?

380
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,800
The real murderer has preconditions.

381
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,800
If the truth is convincing,

382
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,800
they will start a false witness plan.

383
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,800
How about this?

384
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,800
I'll let you think about it.

385
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,800
You can discuss it with your mother when you get home.

386
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:43,800
I can really go home tonight?

387
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,800
But the deadline is tomorrow morning at 9.

388
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,800
You must tell them the name of the murderer.

389
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,800
Otherwise they will arrest you immediately.

390
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,800
Then there will be no false witness plan.

391
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,800
Because they will think you don't believe them.

392
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,800
I'm going to go.

393
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,800
I'm going to go.

394
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,800
I'm going to go.

395
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,800
I'm going to go.

396
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,800
I'm going to go.

397
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,800
I'm going to go.

398
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,800
I'm going to go.

399
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,800
I'm going to go.

400
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,800
I'm going to go.

401
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,800
I'm going to go.

402
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,800
I'm going to go.

403
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,800
I'm going to go.

404
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,800
I'm going to go.

405
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,800
I'm going to go.

406
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:40,800
Grandma.

407
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,800
Brother is back.

408
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,800
Brother is back.

409
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,800
Brother is back.

410
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,800
Look. Brother is back.

411
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,800
Brother is back.

412
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,800
Can we remove the handcuffs

413
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,800
so his siblings won't see us?

414
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,800
Remove it.

415
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,800
I can do it.

416
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,800
I hope you will keep your promise.

417
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,800
A'Bao.

418
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,800
Brother.

419
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,800
You're back.

420
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,800
You're back.

421
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,800
Brother, you're back.

422
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,800
You're back.

423
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,800
You miss me.

424
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,800
Brother.

425
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,800
Give me a hug.

426
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,800
Brother.

427
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,800
You're back.

428
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,800
You're back.

429
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,800
Let's go inside.

430
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,800
Brother.

431
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,800
Brother.

432
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,800
You're back.

433
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,800
You miss me.

434
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,800
Brother, you're back.

435
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,800
Dad, mom.

436
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,800
Hey.

437
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,800
Why can't I find your passport?

438
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,800
What are you going to do?

439
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,800
Buy a plane ticket.

440
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,800
What happened?

441
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,800
Three cups.

442
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,800
Three cups.

443
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,800
Three cups.

444
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,800
A'Bao, time to eat.

445
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,800
Time to eat.

446
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,800
Come on.

447
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,800
Hurry up.

448
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,800
Thanks, mom.

449
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,800
Brother.

450
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,800
Come on.

451
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,800
A'Bao.

452
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,800
Eat more.

453
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,800
Brother, eat.

454
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,800
Brother, eat.

00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,800
Okay, okay.

00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,800
Thank you.

457
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,800
It's delicious.

458
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,800
Delicious.

459
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,800
Delicious.

460
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,800

I'm sorry.

516
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,800
I'm sorry.

517

Ikea coriander

Where's your sister?

527
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,920
We'll leave together.

528
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,600
I can't go to jail.

529
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,800
Or I'll be killed by the people of Hanguilong.

530
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,680
What do you want the police to do?

531
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,120
Hello?

532
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,160
Wei, what's going on?

533
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,560
I don't know.

534
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,520
A'bao won't say anything.

535
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:08,760
Dad.

536
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,120
Hu Zhao.

537
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,400
Are you really leaving?

538
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,720
You decide everything by yourself.

539
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,040
Do we have the right to choose?

540
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:18,840
Not this time.

541
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,360
We'll leave in an hour.

542
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,440
Pack up what you need.

543
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,080
Hurry up.

544
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,280
That bastard judge.

545
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:26,800
A'bao.

546
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,360
You know how much the police don't like the people of our old city.

547
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,040
Do you remember

548
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,600
how they made me not be a police?

549
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,600
Do you really think the police

550
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,000
really want you to be a defamed witness?

551
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,040
Believe me.

552
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,160
I'll definitely find a way to help you.

553
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,640
I'll be there.

554
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,640
I'll be there.

555
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,640
I'll be there.

556
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,400
If I'm caught,

557
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,840
our family will be ruined.

558
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,200
Will you sacrifice me alone?

559
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,560
You know that?

560
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,280
Okay.

561
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,640
In the detention center,

562
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,280
no one was hurt.

563
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:23,920
I'll be there.

564
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,320
Did you tell grandma we're going to Canada?

565
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,200
We'll inform her when we get there.

566
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,560
Why so sudden?

567
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,360
Master.

568
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,840
Ma Shanbao just sent me a message.

569
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,520
He told me to prepare all the documents tomorrow.

570
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,600
I think

571
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,120
Oh.

572
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,120
Yeah.

573
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,240
That's good.

574
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,960
I didn't expect that we could make it.

575
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,760
Thank you, master.

576
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,320
Okay.

577
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,320
Keep up the good work.

578
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,680
The travel agency.

579
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,960
Just take it as a trip.

580
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,840
It's so late.

581
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,160
It's obvious that we're going to run away.

582
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:17,760
That's right.

583
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,600
We're running away.

584
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,440
It's obvious.

585
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,160
Okay?

586
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,440
Okay.

587
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,440
How can I go to school?

588
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,840
You have to work?

589
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,680
I'll arrange it.

590
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,320
You always arrange it yourself.

591
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,120
You never tell me anything.

592
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,520
You never discussed with mom.

593
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,640
Yiwei.

594
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,560
In the middle of the year,

595
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,240
because of your mom,

596
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,600
I never told you or talked to you seriously.

597
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,720
She's the one I love most.

598
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,000
I never thought that

599
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,240
she would leave me like this.

600
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,720
This time,

601
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,880
it might be a test for us.

602
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,160
Now, there's only the two of us left.

603
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,800
We must unite.

604
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,120
Don't question me again.

605
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,200
Ask me.

606
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,440
Okay?

607
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,560
Will you never come back?

608
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,560
Yiwei.

609
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,480
Don't talk to me about mom again.

610
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,560
Why did you become like this?

611
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,720
You didn't let me start over.

612
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,240
No.

613
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,200
You hit someone while driving.

614
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,000
You ran away.

615
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:27,960
Now the police are going to arrest you.

616
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,120
Then let them arrest me.

617
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,160
Yiwei.

618
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,400
Yiwei.

619
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,560
Yiwei.

620
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,520
What's wrong?

621
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,920
What happened?

622
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:23,840
Where's your dad?

623
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,240
I knew something must have happened.

624
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,640
You two never said anything.

625
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,480
Grandma.

626
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,320
Can you let me rest for a while?

627
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,320
Don't ask me now.

628
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,200
I'm not going to ask you.

629
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,160
I'm going to ask you.

630
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,160
I'm going to ask you.

631
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,160
I'm going to ask you.

632
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,160
I'm going to ask you.

633
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,240
I'm not going to ask you.

634
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,360
I'm not going to ask you anything.

635
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:50,720
Come on.

636
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,600
Go inside.

637
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:52,680
Grandma is here.

638
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,680
Don't be afraid.

639
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,480
Grandma will always welcome you here.

640
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,080
Come on.

641
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,120
Ma Shanbao is going to tell us who the real murderer is.

642
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,640
Ma Shanbao.

643
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:12,560
I'm sorry.

644
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,840
I didn't mean to kill you.

645
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,040
I just wanted to save my son.

646
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,320
I'm sorry.

647
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,400
Someone told me

648
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,880
it's the same person.

649
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,200
He said the man who hit the murderer

650
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,680
is called Ma Shanbao.

651
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,040
He lives in the old town.

652
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,720
Now,

653
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,440
the police are protecting him.

654
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,040
Really?

655
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,280
Qianyu,

656
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,280
What are you doing?

657
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,280
You didn't answer my calls and you're not at home.

658
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,280
Did Yiwei go to your place?

659
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,280
She was at my place.

660
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,280
What happened?

661
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,280
I asked her but she refused to tell me anything.

662
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,280
Remember, don't let her leave.

663
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,280
I'll pick her up tomorrow.

664
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,280
Can you stop this?

665
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,280
You don't want to tell me anything.

666
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,280
When things get serious, I can't help you.

667
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,280
I'm telling you,

668
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,280
I won't let Lanlan's story repeat itself.

669
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,280
Tomorrow.

670
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,280
I'll tell you everything tomorrow.

671
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,280
Remember, don't let Yiwei leave.

672
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,280
She's asleep.

673
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,280
See you tomorrow.

674
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,280
I'll be waiting.

675
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,280
Uncle.

676
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,280
Uncle.

677
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,280
Go back.

678
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,280
A'bao.

679
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,280
I won't blame you for this.

680
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,280
You're innocent.

681
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,280
You'll be fine.

682
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,280
I beg you.

683
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,280
Take care of your aunt and cousin.

684
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,280
Uncle.

685
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,280
I won't betray you.

686
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,280
What did you say?

687
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,280
I'll give them a name.

688
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,280
A bad name.

689
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,280
Then,

690
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,280
my mom, brother and sister will leave.

691
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,280
Don't be afraid of them.

692
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,280
You're going to lie to them.

693
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,280
Can you do it?

694
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,280
Lawyer Zhou said they've agreed.

695
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,280
As long as I sign a name for them before 9,

696
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,280
the plan will start.

697
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,280
Then,

698
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,280
our family can leave here.

699
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,280
I'm sorry.

700
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,280
Hello.

701
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,280
Master, why can't you reach me?

702
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,280
I'm on my way.

703
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,280
I hope everything goes well.

704
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,280
Okay.

705
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,280
Be careful.

706
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,280
I'm listening to a message.

707
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,280
Judge Qin,

708
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,280
A Bao won't say anything.

709
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,280
Don't worry. It's okay.

710
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,280
Okay.

711
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,280
I'm sorry.

712
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,280
Xue,

713
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,280
we bought breakfast.

714
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,280
Where's A Bao?

715
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,280
Brother, don't play here.

716
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,280
Eat something.

717
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,280
Let's have breakfast.

718
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,280
Come on.

719
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,280
Come on.

720
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,280
Let's eat.

721
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,280
Let's have breakfast, okay?

722
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,280
Come on.

723
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,280
Come on.

724
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,280
Eat this.

725
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,280
Didn't the lawyer say he would come?

726
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,280
He said he would come this morning.

727
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,280
He should be here soon.

728
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,280
I'll get some for them.

729
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,280
Let me do it.

730
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,280
They'll be relieved to see me not running away.

731
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,280
Come on.

732
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,280
Let's eat.

733
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,280
Have some porridge.

734
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,280
Have some.

735
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,280
Thank you.

736
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,280
Come on.

737
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,280
Come on.

738
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,280
Watch out!

739
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,280
Run for them.

740
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,280
Run!

741
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,280
Run!

742
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,280
Fuck!

743
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,280
Fuck!

744
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,280
Watch them.

745
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,280
Okay.

746
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,280
A Bao!

747
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,280

Wake up, A Bao!

778
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,280
Wake up, A Bao!

779
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,280
Wake up, A Bao!

780
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,280

00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,280
Why can't we be silent?

791
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,280
I can't turn back

792
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:59,280
I'm afraid you'll be more confused

793
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:05,280
The road is long, the good days are short

794
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:09,280
I'm looking forward to the future

795
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:31,280
