00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Episode 16

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,840
There's no such thing as fairness in this world.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Be happy, you brat.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Fatty!

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,760
Let go!

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,560
Help!

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,480
Help! Help!

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,560
Help!

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,160
Help!

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,480
The report of the painting house of Peng Wuji hasn't come out yet.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Who is so anxious to kill Ma Shanbao?

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
What? Isn't the one who was forced to travel called Xu Xiong?

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Yes.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
But Ma Shanbao was right next to Xu Xiong.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Who dares to say that their real target is not Ma Shanbao?

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Moreover, Ma Shanbao's identity has always been kept secret.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
How would the informant know?

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The person below.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It's possible that the person above also knows.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Who said that no one knows about the secret?

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Anyway, I think the whole thing is very strange.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Don't get involved in this.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Just do your job.

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You have to protect yourself.

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Now Ma Shanbao is like a knife.

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Everyone wants to use it to stab each other.

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Not afraid to die.

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The painting house of Peng Wuji

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The painting house of Peng Wuji

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The painting house of Peng Wuji

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Officer Tang, welcome.

32
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Don't you have a lot of cases to deal with?

33
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Are you still Ma Shanbao's agent lawyer?

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
If so, please answer my question.

35
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
If not, I won't waste your time.

36
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You say it.

37
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Do you know that you are in the media interview?

38
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I don't know.

39
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I don't know.

40
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I don't know.

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I don't know.

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I don't know.

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You say it.

44
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Do you know that you are in the media interview?

45
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Will expose Ma Shanbao's identity.

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I never mentioned the three words Ma Shanbao.

47
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
But you said he was from the old city district.

48
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Did Ma Shanbao mention to you?

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
He was involved in a traffic accident.

50
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The case of Zhao Shi and Tao Yi.

51
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I don't need to tell you.

52
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
The conversation between me and my client.

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You can not say it.

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
But I can tell you.

55
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
That one was hit badly.

56
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Still in the ICU.

57
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
The person who was hit was Han Gang.

58
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
He is Han Kuilong's eldest son.

59
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Do you know that the police used all means to block the news?

60
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You exposed all the questions.

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I am just stating the facts.

62
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
His name is Xu Xiong.

63
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
He is from the old city district.

64
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
When he was hit badly.

65
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
He was right next to Ma Shanbao.

66
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
The police do not rule out their real target.

67
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It is Ma Shanbao.

68
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Who did it?

69
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
The police arrested Ma Shanbao.

70
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
They transferred him to the prison.

71
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
If you insist on protecting him.

72
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
No one can guarantee his safety.

73
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Think about it.

74
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Ma Shanbao.

75
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Why are you not eating?

76
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Who is the one who broke the hot oil?

77
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Ask.

78
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Of course, the Han family.

79
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
They are always in disagreement with the old city gang.

80
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Everyone knows.

81
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
But this time, it was hit badly.

82
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You are also from the old city district.

83
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Be careful.

84
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Has my lawyer been here?

85
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
No.

86
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I have to call him.

87
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Hello.

88
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
This is Zhou Luo Wen's message box.

89
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Hello.

90
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
This is Zhou Luo Wen's message box.

91
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I can't answer the phone right now.

92
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Please leave a message.

93
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Protecting the city.

94
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Why don't you just call the lawyer to shut up?

95
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
What is the difference between us and the Han Kui Long?

96
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Hu San.

97
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
We can't just stand by and watch like we are fighting.

98
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Now Xu Xiu and Han Gang are in the same hospital.

99
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
If we don't think of a way.

100
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
The hospital will be on the battlefield at any time.

101
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Come in.

102
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Sir.

103
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Madam.

104
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You'd better come out and have a look.

105
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Sir. Madam.

106
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
What is this?

107
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Qi Chang Rong sent it.

108
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I don't know what he means.

109
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's obviously a way to pay respect to the emperor.

110
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Xu Xiu is his man.

111
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
He is showing us his power.

112
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
No.

113
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
The man he wants to pay respect to is Han Kui Long.

114
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Please help me give it to Han Kui Long.

115
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Since he is fond of hot oil.

116
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I'll treat him to fried pork head with oil.

117
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Will Qi Chang Rong be too arrogant?

118
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
This is clearly a provocation.

119
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Why don't you throw it away?

120
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's too bad.

121
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I can't throw it away.

122
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
How can I waste my family's good intentions?

123
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You are going to deliver the goods?

124
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Since it is a private dish made for Han Kui Long.

125
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Of course I have to deliver it while it's hot.

126
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'll go.

127
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I knew you would come.

128
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
But I didn't expect that you would come in person.

129
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Eat it while it's hot.

130
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's a gift from my family.

131
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
If you want to trouble me.

132
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Deliver it to that crazy dog.

133
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Aren't you afraid that others will say that we are working together?

134
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Just with a pig's head.

135
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
No wonder you are going to throw it away

136
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
with a anonymous call.

137
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
If you can't hand it over.

138
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Next time, you might not only throw hot oil.

139
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Your eldest son didn't die.

140
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
He has regained his life.

141
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Sit down.

142
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
What's the difference between him and death?

143
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I know you found the suspect.

144
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I also know that you have a spray gun

145
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
that you found at the scene.

146
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It's not that I force you to say it.

147
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Even if you don't say it.

148
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I can still find it.

149
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Then I can just point out a person from the old city district.

150
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I can point out that he did it.

151
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Then I can see him die.

152
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
If you are happy.

153
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I can also solve the case.

154
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
We win.

155
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
But you know I won't do that.

156
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I am not the black police that you bought with money.

157
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I know that you came here not just to deliver food.

158
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I will definitely investigate this case.

159
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
But I need time.

160
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Okay.

161
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You can investigate it slowly.

162
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
As long as you can't find it.

163
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You have to clean up every day.

164
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
This is not right.

165
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Hold on.

166
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Hold on, son.

167
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I heard that your son Han Lie is back.

168
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
What?

169
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Dad is in jail.

170
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I am in jail.

171
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I am in jail.

172
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I am in jail.

173
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Brother is in a coma.

174
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
He is in jail.

175
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Brothers are deeply in love.

176
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It's normal.

177
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Father and son are deeply in love.

178
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
He is in jail with you.

179
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Do you have evidence?

180
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
According to your rules.

181
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
What evidence do you want?

182
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I said I have.

183
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
But I know.

184
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Han Gang is your successor.

185
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
In your mind.

186
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
It's the most important to keep your son.

187
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I don't want to die.

188
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I am alive.

189
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
oga

190
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I can't.

191
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I robiros.

192
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Back off

193
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,160
Don't play tricks.

194
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,000
Don't let your subordinates

195
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,720
come to you.

196
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,240
Especially your son, Han Lie.

197
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,280
I've applied for a paper from the superior.

198
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,360
You can go out and visit your eldest son.

199
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:27,880
Just once.

200
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Two throws.

201
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,680
Your dad took them.

202
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,120
I'd cut him off,

203
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,560
but he's not as kind as she was.

204
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,200
He Billionaire Prime Minister

205
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,360
Secretary of Compared Peyote Shame

206
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,360
"?

207
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,720
Did you go ask Ma Hongff?

208
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,680
I went because I wanted to see her.

209
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,160
She's atyrannus once.

210
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,360
But Ma Hong's roundhead

211
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,720
won't want to see him.

212
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,720
The dedicate dazu력

213
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:15,360
Six

214
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,720
I'm not hungry.

215
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,720
Han,

216
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,320
is the pig's head delicious?

217
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,320
Qi Changru,

218
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,720
the cow isn't hot enough.

219
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,920
The skin is definitely not crispy enough.

220
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,120
I'll fry it crispy next time.

221
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,320
Shut up!

222
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,720
You,

223
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,320
stop!

224
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,320
Don't move!

225
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,320
Go!

226
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,920
You're a loser!

227
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,520
You're a loser!

228
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,120
Raise your hand.

229
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,120
Turn around.

230
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,320
Turn around.

231
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,720
Stop!

232
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,720
Stop!

233
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,720
Tell me.

234
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,120
Does it have anything to do with you

235
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,320
that Da Xiong is in this state?

236
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,920
You asked me to persuade A'bao to confess.

237
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,520
You said that money

238
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,320
was used to buy him

239
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,720
to spend a few years in prison.

240
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,320
So, you bought

241
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,320
A'bao's life?

242
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,320
What money?

243
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,320
When Da Xiong was in trouble,

244
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,720
A'bao was also there.

245
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,720
I don't know who the next person

246
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,120
who was in trouble would be.

247
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,520
What's wrong with the money that Xiong received?

248
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,720
I've found the best doctor.

249
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,320
Da Xiong will be fine.

250
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:47,320
But I don't know who Da Xiong is in trouble with.

251
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,120
Don't worry.

252
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,520
Da Xiong is my brother

253
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,720
and my family.

254
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,120
A'bao is also my brother.

255
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,320
It's okay.

256
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,320
You can tell me

257
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,320
everything.

258
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,720
I'm here to avenge

259
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,520
the death of my wife and child.

260
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,520
Tell me what happened to the money.

261
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,320
Why did you give it to Xue?

262
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,120
Where did you get the money?

263
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,520
How much did you give him?

264
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,920
Honey, I'm scared.

265
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,920
We're still young.

266
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,520
I'm scared of Xichang Rong.

267
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,520
I know

268
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,720
I won't let anything happen to you.

269
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,320
I'm more scared of you.

270
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,920
What happened that night?

271
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,320
Why was A'bao

272
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,320
detained by the police and not bailed?

273
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,720
What did you and Ximaguan

274
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,520
hide from me?

275
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,320
Tell me!

276
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,720
Who is it?

277
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,120
Qin Fangguan.

278
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,120
Answer it.

279
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,320
Answer it!

280
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,720
Fine, if you don't answer it, I'll answer it for you.

281
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,320
Answer it!

282
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,320
Qin Fangguan,

283
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,320
we're going to court.

284
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,520
Is my brother feeling better?

285
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,720
He's not getting better.

286
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,720
But fortunately, he's not getting worse.

287
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,320
But he's been lying down for a long time.

288
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,320
His muscles are easy to shrink.

289
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,720
If you have time,

290
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,720
you can massage his hands and legs.

291
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,720
It will be better for blood circulation.

292
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,320
I'm really not used to

293
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,720
my brother being like this.

294
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,920
He used to go out to fight.

295
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,720
He never stopped

296
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,720
until he beat everyone to death.

297
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,920
It's not necessary to be so powerful

298
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,320
when you're on a group fight.

299
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,320
Aren't you afraid of me?

300
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,720
What's there to be afraid of?

301
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,920
Then why don't you dare to look at me?

302
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,320
Hello.

303
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,720
A sandwich.

304
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,320
Oh, and...

305
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,320
I want another cup of milk tea.

306
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,320
I bought it for you.

307
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,320
I misunderstood you before.

308
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,320
I was wrong.

309
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,320
I'm sorry.

310
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,720
Are you

311
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,920
not good at apologizing?

312
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,520
Do you want me to say it?

313
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,520
I don't drink milk tea.

314
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,320
Then pour it in.

315
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,120
I won't take back

316
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,520
what I gave you.

317
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,320
Here.

318
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,320
Please have a drink.

319
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,120
Thank you.

320
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,120
There's no straw.

321
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,920
Ye Chao, your sandwich.

322
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,920
Where's the milk tea?

323
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,520
You can go out first.

324
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,920
I just came out of the hospital.

325
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,320
Yi Wei.

326
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,320
These two days,

327
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,920
you should stay at your grandma's house.

328
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,920
What's wrong?

329
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,320
I've been busy lately.

330
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,120
You should stay at her house.

331
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,120
Someone will take care of you.

332
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,320
Her house is close to your school.

333
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,920
Good morning, Officer Qin.

334
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,920
Long-distance traffic.

335
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,920
Officer Qin.

336
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,920
Long-distance traffic.

337
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,720
May I come in?

338
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,320
Please.

339
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,120
Good morning.

340
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,120
A friend from the police station

341
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,120
informed me

342
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,120
that you reported to the police last night.

343
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,320
I've checked it for you.

344
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,120
Someone wanted to make an apology.

345
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,320
We've reinforced

346
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,720
the patrol of the nearby police.

347
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,520
Thank you for asking you to go out.

348
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,920
I'm a little worried.

349
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,320
They won't give up

350
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,320
on the incident of the bomb.

351
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,120
So I'll deal with it for you as soon as possible.

352
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,720
Anyway, you've been out recently.

353
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,720
Be careful.

354
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,520
Do you have anything else?

355
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,120
I'm in a hurry to send her to school.

356
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,720
If you have anything else to ask,

357
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,720
call me at any time.

358
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:25,920
Okay.

359
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,320
Be careful.

360
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,720
Bye.

361
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,920
Coach.

362
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,720
Sorry.

363
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,720
I've got you involved in my business.

364
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,320
It's okay. It's over.

365
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,320
Don't mention it.

366
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,720
I'm sorry.

367
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,720
I'm sorry.

368
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,720
I'm sorry.

369
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,720
I'm sorry.

370
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,720
I'm sorry.

371
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,920
I was drunk because I was unhappy.

372
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,920
I miss my mother.

373
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,120
I'm from a single-parent family.

374
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,120
I know your mother died.

375
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,920
But it's not the reason why you drank.

376
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,920
No.

377
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,920
It's different.

378
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,920
My mother...

379
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,920
was a suicide.

380
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,720
Hello.

381
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,920
A'bao was replaced by a single-parent family.

382
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,720
I don't know if I want to protect him or deal with him.

383
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,520
Calm down.

384
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,520
How can I calm down?

385
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,320
How can I explain to him?

386
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,720
We have no way out.

387
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,720
I think it's best to give up.

388
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,520
I'm not sure if I can do it.

389
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,720
I'm not sure if I can do it.

390
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,720
I'm not sure if I can do it.

391
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,120
It might be the best way to get back what you did.

392
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:05,720
No.

393
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,920
You can't do that.

394
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,120
If you do that,

395
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,720
it will harm him and you.

396
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,120
Last night,

397
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,920
a few strangers stood at my door.

398
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,920
Who were they?

399
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:18,720
I don't know.

400
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,920
They left as soon as I left.

401
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,120
But I suspect

402
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,720
they might be from the Han Kui Long.

403
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,920
Even he knows?

404
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,320
I'm not sure.

405
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,720
But what I can be sure is

406
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,720
he won't give up easily.

407
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,920
If you call the police, he will know.

408
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,520
You can't escape.

409
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,320
You have a wife and kids.

410
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,520
What should I do?

411
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,920
The only thing you can do now is

412
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,120
A'bao can't admit his crime.

413
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,520
If A'bao admits his crime,

414
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,120
Han Kui Long will kill

415
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,920
all the people involved in this case.

416
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,920
Including me and my son.

417
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,720
You and your wife.

418
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,120
And two kids.

419
00:27:59,120 --> 00:27:59,920
Remember.

420
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,320
We can't say anything now.

421
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,720
A'bao too.

422
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,720
But I can't contact A'bao.

423
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,520
Why?

424
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,720
The money last time,

425
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,120
he and his mother don't trust me anymore.

426
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,920
Even my wife is watching me.

427
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,520
What about lawyer Zhou?

428
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,320
Lawyer Zhou told me

429
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,320
he resigned.

430
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,320
Lawyer Zhou was so 끝wer object.

431
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,320
What was he trying to do?

432
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:54,320
To get a lawyer and instantly

433
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,320
lose his ability.

434
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,620
Drinking is your choice, young man.

435
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,640
All right.

436
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:06,120
Forgive me for being frivolous.

437
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,240
Here is your tea for today.

438
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,120
Welcome.

439
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,200
Nice meeting you, Senioroti Princess.

440
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:25,900
Boss, why are you so polite?

441
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:28,500
I feel a little depressed and uncomfortable.

442
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,700
I'm sorry.

443
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:35,500
I messed up the case you gave me.

444
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,100
Don't be silly.

445
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:41,100
You're always winning in the case.

446
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,300
You don't want to give up, do you?

447
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:50,700
Sometimes I want to be as strong as you.

448
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:53,500
Actually, I'm not as strong as you think.

449
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,500
After my wife died,

450
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,900
I lost my sense of direction.

451
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,700
My wife committed suicide.

452
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:18,700
What I can't let go of is...

453
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:23,100
I can't figure out why she committed suicide.

454
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,700
I can never figure it out.

455
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:36,700
I think you should have a reason.

456
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:39,100
I believe you've tried your best.

457
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:43,900
But in this world, not everything has an answer.

458
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:49,700
I've never told anyone about this.

459
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:54,900
I just want you to know that no matter you're a judge or a lawyer,

460
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:57,900
you can't show your weaknesses in front of people.

461
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:02,100
Because these weaknesses will be used by others.

462
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,300
What happened?

463
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,100
Tang Xuan asked me.

464
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:19,100
He even showed me a picture of a young man who was badly burned by the hot oil.

465
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,100
Because I went to the old city,

466
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:23,100
because I was interviewed by the media,

467
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,300
all of these started because of me.

468
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,900
You only told me that Ma Shanbao stole the car.

469
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:31,300
But now, it's already involved in the Black Gang's assassination.

470
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,500
I can't do it.

471
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,500
I really can't do it.

472
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:43,900
During the investigation, the Tang's Governor's Office caught a suspect.

473
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:48,500
His only goal now is to find evidence to sue this suspect.

474
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:53,100
But it's obvious that he doesn't have enough evidence.

475
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,700
How do you know?

476
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:58,100
If you have enough evidence, you don't need to use the picture to scare you.

477
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,300
They said Ma Shanbao is in danger now.

478
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:05,700
They'll use the safest method to protect him.

479
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:10,500
They said that they just want to use the time to sue that suspect.

480
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,300
These are their usual methods.

481
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,700
Why did you go to the old city?

482
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:23,500
I went to find evidence that Ma Shanbao isn't there.

483
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,700
What evidence?

484
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:32,100
When the car accident happened, Ma Shanbao was stealing another car.

485
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,900
This is the evidence that he isn't there.

486
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,500
Hello?

487
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,700
Han Lie.

488
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,500
This is my personal phone number.

489
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:52,700
I called you directly and you called the police.

490
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:55,500
They killed my men.

491
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,700
Who did it? We're investigating.

492
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:00,500
Our men were burned to death.

493
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,900
They were like garbage.

494
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:05,500
There are still three-year-old children in his house.

495
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:08,700
I told you. The police are investigating.

496
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,700
Are we investigating?

497
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,500
Who else is there besides Qi Changlong?

498
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:16,500
And also, where is my brother's case?

499
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,900
You said you were investigating.

500
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:22,100
Where is the murderer? Did you catch him?

501
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:25,500
Is there any exclusive clue for the case of the hot oil?

502
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,700
Can you provide it to the police?

503
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,300
Mr. Lie.

504
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,700
Mr. Lie.

505
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,700
Mr. Lie.

506
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:03,100
Mr. Lie, we've already sent someone to the Iron Head's house to comfort his family.

507
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:06,700
We've already settled the family expenses according to your request.

508
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,500
He has been with me for so many years.

509
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:16,500
No matter what, let him walk with dignity.

510
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:27,900
Qi Changlong is so arrogant. We must take it back.

511
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:31,900
Master Long said we can't act without permission.

512
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,900
What does this mean?

513
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:39,500
Ask a bodyguard to hide in the house and be a coward.

514
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:43,900
Little Lie, don't be so angry.

515
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:46,300
Your brother is in the hospital now.

516
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:49,500
If anything happens outside, we'll be the ones to suffer.

517
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,100
You must trust your father.

518
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:54,700
He's not acting without permission because he's timid.

519
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,700
He has his plans.

520
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:59,300
I don't not believe him.

521
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:02,100
I don't believe those police.

522
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,500
We can sell the black police.

523
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:07,100
Qi Changlong can do the same.

524
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,300
No one can rely on him.

525
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,700
I can only rely on myself.

526
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,100
What did you say?

527
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,900
You're stealing another car. What evidence do you have?

528
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,500
What did Ma Shanbao say to you?

529
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,300
I can't tell the truth about the conversation with the person.

530
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,700
Didn't you teach me this?

531
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,500
Yes.

532
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,100
I just think Ma Shanbao has his own secret.

533
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:40,900
I don't know if you believe what he said.

534
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,900
He has another accomplice.

535
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,300
I went to the old city district to look for him.

536
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,700
What other accomplice? What's his name?

537
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,500
I want to analyze it for you.

538
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,100
I know.

539
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,900
He's also from the old city district.

540
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,500
He's one year younger than Ma Shanbao.

541
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,900
Did you find him?

542
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,100
Don't mention it.

543
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:07,300
When I went in, they used a broom to drive me away.

544
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,300
They kept scolding me.

545
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:16,100
In the old city district, most of them are Qi Changlong's people.

546
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:19,700
The information they got there is unreliable.

547
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:25,300
I think you should focus your energy on Ma Shanbao.

548
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,700
You know he's being held in prison alone.

549
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:33,100
He must be feeling lonely and helpless.

550
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:38,700
If you don't help him, no one will.

551
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,900
What should I tell him?

552
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:00,100
You'd better tell him not to say anything.

553
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:03,700
Because no matter what he says, others will misunderstand.

554
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,700
Yes.

555
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,100
You're the attorney thousand.

556
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:32,100
Mrs. Cao, is Wei in there?

557
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,380
What did you and A'bao do that night?

558
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:35,580
Who?

559
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:37,700
What happened to the money and the car?

560
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:38,620
Tell me!

561
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:39,460
Give me the phone.

562
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:40,260
Give it to me.

563
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,100
Give it to me?

564
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:46,500
Hello?

565
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,060
Wei,

566
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:48,700
you must help me.

567
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:50,060
Or we'll both die.

568
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:52,100
There's a young man named Xiaobei in Jiu Chengxu.

569
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:52,780
He's 17 years old.

570
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:53,940
He runs a grocery store.

571
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:54,660
Do you know him?

572
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:56,820
Do you want water?

573
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:57,660
Do you want to eat something?

574
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:58,740
No, thanks.

575
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:02,940
Let's go.

576
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:16,460
If we find him,

577
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,500
we must hide for a while.

578
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:19,260
My wife will show up in Jiu Chengxu.

579
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:20,740
I'll ask her.

580
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:31,060
Did you see him?

581
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,260
Shanbao went to the medical room.

582
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:43,540
I know

583
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:46,740
you cherish your friendship with Judge Qin.

584
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:49,620
But no matter it's Qi Changrong or Han Kuilong,

585
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,460
we can't afford to bother him.

586
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:03,380
Do you know a man named Xiaobei?

587
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:04,580
He's 17 years old.

588
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:06,420
He runs a grocery store.

589
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,580
Why are you looking for him?

590
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:13,860
I can't tell you.

591
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,300
Don't you remember

592
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,780
there are two children in our family?

593
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,140
I have this family

594
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,100
just for two children.

595
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:28,140
I have no choice.

596
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:31,940
I'm going to the police station.

597
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:32,500
What?

598
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,060
You...

599
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:33,740
Wait for me.

600
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:39,660
What's up?

601
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:41,140
Ma Shanbao said

602
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,780
it's an old white Benz.

603
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:45,220
I asked them to check

604
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:46,980
if Ma Shanbao's fingerprints were on the car.

605
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,100
And I asked

606
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,700
the friend who stole the car with him.

607
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:51,540
Is it reliable?

608
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:53,180
Actually, I left a copy.

609
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:55,300
I don't know if it's a fake.

610
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,340
I don't know if it's a fake.

611
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:57,380
I don't know if it's a fake.

612
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,500
I don't know if it's a fake.

613
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,500
I don't know if it's a fake.

614
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,500
I don't know if it's a fake.

615
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,100
I don't know if it's a fake.

616
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,100
I don't know if it's a fake.

617
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:03,940
I don't know if it's a fake.

618
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:04,940
I don't know if it's a fake.

619
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,140
Come on.

620
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:08,740
Let's go.

621
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:17,940
Take a look.

622
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,220
I should have made a video

623
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:26,700
of Ma Shanbao's car at that time.

624
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,300
As long as I can find the car,

625
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,940
it could prove Ma Shanbao was not there.

626
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,140
At about 10 p.m.

627
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,140
when I was leaving,

628
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:33,420
I found Ma Shanmao

629
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:34,900
near my house.

630
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,220
What?

631
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:38,020
When I was in the police station,

632
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:39,380
I told the police.

633
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,580
Why didn't you tell me?

634
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:43,460
Because my car and the accident

635
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:44,620
happened two hours apart.

636
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:45,500
But shouldn't you

637
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:46,380
tell me first?

638
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:47,220
A lot of things happened.

639
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:49,540
This is a very important clue.

640
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:50,780
Maybe someone stole my car

641
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:51,420
and hit someone.

642
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,260
Why didn't you tell me

643
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:52,940
you recognized Ma Shanmao?

644
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:53,620
Because I didn't want to

645
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:54,300
affect your judgment.

646
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,220
So I didn't tell you

647
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,500
if you wanted to give up the case.

648
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,580
Three hours ago,

649
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:01,620
I really wanted to give up the case.

650
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:02,740
You can tell him...

651
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:03,900
You asked me to insist.

652
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,100
You can tell him.

653
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,940
You said Ma Shanmao admitted

654
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:09,420
that he didn't agree to use his car.

655
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:10,180
This crime

656
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,620
would last for at least two years.

657
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,180
If you ask him to slow down,

658
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,740
he might let it go in three months.

659
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:16,500
Do you think Han Kuilong

660
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,620
will be patient

661
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:18,220
and let Ma Shanmao

662
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,300
get out of prison alive?

663
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,580
You're a lawyer, not a bodyguard.

664
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:21,100
Yes.

665
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:23,500
I am a lawyer.

666
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,500
You were a lawyer too.

667
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,340
You were a lawyer too.

668
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:28,180
A lawyer's duty

669
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:28,740
is to protect

670
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:30,260
the biggest interests of the parties.

671
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:38,860
I'm sorry, Master.

672
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,420
I think there are

673
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:43,700
many things wrong with this case.

674
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:47,540
I'll continue to deal with this case

675
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:48,540
in my own way.

676
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:56,700
Tang Ducha.

677
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:02,500
I told you

678
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,740
that when the car accident happened,

679
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:05,340
I was the one who stole this car.

680
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,540
The young man who was with Ma Shanmao

681
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:09,340
was called Xiaobei.

682
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:10,140
He's 17 years old.

683
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:11,620
He's also from the old city district.

684
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:13,100
His family owns a grocery store.

685
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,260
If we can prove

686
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:15,900
that he was the one who stole the car,

687
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,060
we can also prove that

688
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:18,460
he was the one who stole the car.

689
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:18,900
I'm sure

690
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,340
that he was the one who stole the car.

691
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:21,060
I'm sure

692
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,500
that he was the one who stole the car.

693
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,060
I'm sure

694
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,300
that he was the one who stole the car.

695
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:25,620
If we can prove

696
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:27,500
that Ma Shanmao was not the one who hurt Han Gang,

697
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,900
then there's no reason for Han Kuilong

698
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:30,060
to go to the old city to fight.

699
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:58,580
Wuïm месте

700
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:22,660
Xihu.

701
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:25,060
It's more familiar to the old city.

702
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:26,180
I can go by myself.

703
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:26,900
You wait for me here.

704
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:27,420
No.

705
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:28,740
It's between us.

706
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:30,020
I'll go with you.

707
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:31,660
I can handle it myself.

708
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:33,700
You're the president of the court.

709
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:34,580
Don't take the risk.

710
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:36,060
I'm the one who got you into trouble.

711
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:37,180
Let's go together.

712
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:54,100
The car should be in front.

713
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:56,340
This one.

714
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:56,860
This one.

715
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:57,580
It's this one.

716
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:23,700
Wei.

717
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:24,700
Wei.

718
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:26,660
There's a police car.

719
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:27,580
Run.

720
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:32,060
Where should we go?

721
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:32,940
Behind us.

722
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:34,540
Come on.

723
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:43,780
Hurry.

724
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:44,900
Let's go.

725
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:25,660
Eu ужас

726
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:28,960
Is it good to know what was it like to be in the same place
