This lunch is very important.

3
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,440
I sent it to you in person

4
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,960
because I didn't want to be killed by others.

5
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,840
If there is any result,

6
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,200
you can only inform me.

7
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:38,840
Hello.

8
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,120
I know who hurt Han Gang.

00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,120
Who are you?

10
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,840
Who are you?

11
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,520
If Han Kuilong knows

12
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,480
that the one who hurt his son is Qi Changrong,

13
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,200
this matter will be over.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It's Qi Changrong from the Old City Gang.

Are all of you going to make a beat?

Mom said

24
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,380
we had failed in the advanced tricks of the scores.

25
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:13,700
How Come It stuck?

26
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,620
Alright, Sabre,

27
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:15,380
that's all it is.

28
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,140
Dry and Klarū,

29
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,060
Would you wash your hands for me?

30
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,100
Essong Bro,

31
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:19,940
will you press the dishes?

32
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:20,260
I will,

33
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:20,860
I will,

34
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,020
양ят cafe it is.

35
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:22,780
I'll prepare it.

36
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,460
Don't break my ice-cream

37
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,500
or it's gonna fall down.

38
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:27,660
Mom said

39
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,140
soaking ice and playing with water

40
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,540
is a good thing

41
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,980
since I am accessorizing.

42
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:32,740
Please don't be trying.

43
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,180
Connect my eyes.

44
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:34,900
Got it.

45
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:35,660
Wait.

46
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,580
You haven't been back for a long time.

47
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:44,580
Let's talk inside.

48
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,340
Brother Qi.

49
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,580
Ask Xiaobei to get some pork and fruit.

50
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:55,820
And chili sauce.

51
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:56,860
Yes, Brother Qi.

52
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,940
I remember you like it.

53
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,740
Brother Qi, beer.

54
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,340
Do you know why I called you here?

55
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,340
No.

56
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,980
Xue came to me last night.

57
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,420
She cried so much that her eyes were swollen.

58
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:22,580
You should know about Ma Shanbao's death.

59
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:24,780
I heard about it.

60
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,940
A'bao is the eldest son.

61
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,460
His father died.

62
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,540
He's the only one in the family who can support him.

63
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,180
To steal a car,

64
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:38,220
this is not a good deal, right?

65
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,460
Xue told me that

66
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,540
someone asked A'bao out

67
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,420
on the night A'bao was arrested.

68
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,060
Do you know who it was?

69
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,020
It was your husband, Cao Wei'er.

70
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,740
Speaking of which,

71
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,860
you were fired by the police

72
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,380
and offended all your brothers.

73
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,340
You can't get along with them.

74
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,660
You can only support a family

75
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,860
by getting some money.

76
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,500
Our life is simple.

77
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,940
We just need a place to live.

78
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,020
Brother Qi, the pork is here.

79
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,020
Don't go anywhere for a few days.

80
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,380
Stay at home.

81
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,500
Thank you, Brother Qi.

82
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,380
Although you married an outsider,

83
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,420
I still want you to be happy.

84
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,340
But the one who stays in the old city

85
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,340
is my wife, Qi Chengrong.

86
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,980
I can't leave her alone in the event of an accident.

87
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,020
Get in.

88
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,380
Get in.

89
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,460
You're from the old city.

90
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:26,740
Come on.

91
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,060
Come on.

92
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,100
Come on.

93
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,500
My name is Da Xiong.

94
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,580
Da Peng Xiong.

95
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,740
No one dares to touch you with me.

96
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:43,900
I'll take care of you.

97
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,140
Sit down.

98
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,700
What's your name?

99
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:50,780
A'bao.

100
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,540
A'bao.

101
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,020
Brother,

102
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,300
what did you do?

103
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,940
I asked so many questions

104
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,220
about you.

105
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,180
What about you?

106
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,500
They said I stole a car.

107
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,940
It's a small thing.

108
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,500
I won't let you keep your promise.

109
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,220
Tell me the truth.

110
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:13,860
Ma Changbao,

111
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,180
your lawyer is here.

112
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,100
Was Lou Wei at home that night?

113
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:24,980
Yes.

114
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,140
A'bao came to see him.

115
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,900
I know you won't say anything

116
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,700
that's bad for your husband.

117
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:40,220
But don't force me to take your child as an excuse.

118
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,300
Do you understand?

119
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:51,780
What did they talk about?

120
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,100
Do you know Han Kuilong?

121
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:55,860
No.

122
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,380
Everyone knows that

123
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,060
Han Kuilong and I are in a bad relationship.

124
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,540
We'll fight sooner or later.

125
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,660
His eldest son is lying in the hospital now.

126
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,060
The guy who hit him has been hiding for a long time.

127
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:10,060
The whole world says that I'm the one who saved him.

128
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:11,940
So the police

129
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,940
will definitely find out who did it.

130
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,180
I'm sure that

131
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,780
Han Kuilong is the one who did it.

132
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:17,740
I'm sure that

133
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,340
Han Kuilong is the one who saved him.

134
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,340
I'm sure that

135
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,740
the police will definitely find out who did it.

136
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,700
If Han Kuilong's son dies,

137
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,180
A'bao will not only steal cars.

138
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,660
He will kill him.

139
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,700
Your husband

140
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,260
will be involved in this matter.

141
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,140
A'bao.

142
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,060
Do you want me to help you?

143
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,460
You're my client.

144
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,940
If you want me to continue to help you,

145
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:03,900
you have to tell your uncle

146
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,300
that he can't fire me.

147
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,420
Do I want to see my mother?

148
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,780
You can only see the lawyer for now.

149
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,780
If we cooperate,

150
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,780
I can try my best to help you apply for security.

151
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,260
If there's nothing,

152
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,860
you can go home and see your mother.

153
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,380
She...

154
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,900
They said that I'm not only stealing cars,

155
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,340
but also involved in a traffic accident

156
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,100
that seriously hurt people.

157
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,900
Did you say who you ran into?

158
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,700
Where? When?

159
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,180
I didn't run into anyone.

160
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:51,900
Han Kuilong

161
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,340
He offered big money but stole it.

162
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,340
This time,

163
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,700
You should tell Lin Xintong

164
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,500
that we Qingcheng 알아보�く

165
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,460
is just for her.

166
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,420
According to the police records,

167
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,380
That car was stolen

168
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,300
I won't let you say it.

169
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,540
If the car accident

170
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,260
seriously injured someone,

171
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,860
you must be sentenced to five years.

172
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:33,780
If you didn't steal the car

173
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,140
or run into anyone,

174
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,300
where were you at that time?

175
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:39,780
I was in the old town.

176
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,180
Did anyone see you?

177
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:43,780
At that time,

178
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,260
I was with a friend.

179
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,380
What's his name?

180
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,420
I need to find him

181
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,180
to help you

182
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,540
to make evidence that he wasn't there.

183
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,180
So that you can go home.

184
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,740
I can really trust you.

185
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:12,980
His name is Xiaobei.

186
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,180
At that time, he and I

187
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,940
stole another car in the old town.

188
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,220
A white Benz

189
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,340
in the old town.

190
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,460
It's rare to see it in the old town.

191
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,620
The police caught him that night.

192
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,980
But there's no news of him until now.

193
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,340
Then give him money.

194
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:35,900
No one might be able to

195
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,500
make money.

196
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:40,700
I don't care.

197
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,100
I must know who this person is

198
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,220
and where he is hiding.

199
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:48,780
What are you doing?

200
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,460
I'm giving the injection to someone.

201
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,060
The doctor said

202
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,460
I need to give it every four hours.

203
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,420
Who are you?

204
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,900
You're not the previous nurse.

205
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,060
The previous nurse asked for leave.

206
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,380
I transferred from the northern district.

207
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,540
If you have any questions,

208
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,300
you can ask the nurse directly.

209
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,220
I'm not the previous nurse.

210
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,180
I'm the new nurse.

211
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,420
I'm the new nurse.

212
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:15,540
I'm the new nurse.

213
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,060
I'm the new nurse.

214
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,220
There's hope in life.

215
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,260
May I give the injection?

216
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,940
I heard they're all members of the Black Society.

217
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,940
But they look pretty handsome.

218
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,940
But they're all members of the Black Society.

219
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:55,940
Yeah.

220
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:56,940
That's scary.

221
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,940
The blood on the spray has been confirmed.

222
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:20,940
It's from Han Gang.

223
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:22,940
And

224
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,940
we've got some incomplete fingerprints.

225
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:25,940
They're still being compared.

226
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:37,000
What about the

227
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,940
exhaust fumes on the spray?

228
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:39,940
It's from Han Gang.

229
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:40,940
It's from Han Gang.

230
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:41,940
It's from Han Gang.

231
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:42,940
It's from Han Gang.

232
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:43,940
It's from Han Gang.

233
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:44,940
It's from Han Gang.

234
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:45,940
It's from Han Gang.

235
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:46,940
It's from Han Gang.

236
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,940
What about the exhaust fumes on the spray?

237
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,940
We've already tested it for you.

238
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:51,940
A machine is a machine.

239
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:52,940
It's fixed.

240
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,940
It's useless to worry.

241
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:55,940
Alright.

242
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:56,940
I'll give it to you as soon as possible.

243
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:58,940
Thank you, Senior.

244
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:05,940
Inspector Tang.

245
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,940
I have evidence that Ma Shanbao is not here.

246
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,940
He didn't run into anyone or Zhao Shi.

247
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:14,940
Tell me.

248
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,940
When Ma Shanbao said it was a crime,

249
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,940
he was with a friend from the old city district.

250
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,940
This person can prove that he wasn't at the crime scene.

251
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:23,940
Lawyer Zhou.

252
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,940
Although you were handed over by Judge Qin,

253
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,940
you still have to accumulate experience by yourself.

254
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,940
You can't learn it in class.

255
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,940
A criminal like Ma Shanbao who has a criminal record

256
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,940
heard some stories in the prison.

257
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:34,940
After hearing it,

258
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:35,940
he thought it was his own

259
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,940
and planned to use it to escape punishment.

260
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,940
And these so-called evidence,

261
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:40,940
Yes.

262
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,940
Time, location, and people have them.

263
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:43,940
But who can he fool in the end?

264
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,940
Maybe he can only fool you, Lawyer Zhou.

265
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,940
You can check it in the old city district.

266
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,940
There is a stolen white old-style branch.

267
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,940
It's rare to see it in the old city district.

268
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:54,940
As long as I find that car,

269
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,940
I can give you the evidence that Ma Shanbao is not there.

270
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:57,940
Because of your words,

271
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:00,940
I have to search the whole old city district to find this car.

272
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:01,940
Do you know how big the old city district is?

273
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,940
How much experience do I have to use?

274
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:04,940
Since there is a doubt,

275
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,940
the police should investigate.

276
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:07,940
Isn't this your duty?

277
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:09,940
Yes.

278
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:10,940
As soon as possible.

279
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:12,940
When is it as soon as possible?

280
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:16,940
Lawyer Zhou,

281
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,940
you may have only this one case.

282
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:19,940
But what about us?

283
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:21,940
Look at it yourself.

284
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:26,940
All the cases here are as important to us as you.

285
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:27,940
So I say,

286
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,940
as soon as possible.

287
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:46,940
Coach.

288
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:49,940
Where are you going?

289
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,940
I am suspended from school and I am being investigated.

290
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,940
I have made the worst plan.

291
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:00,940
I am sorry.

292
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:02,940
What's the use?

293
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:09,940
I will go home now.

294
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,940
Tell my dad to tell the school about the case.

295
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:13,940
Don't do it.

296
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:14,940
I will come back tomorrow to answer the call.

297
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,940
I don't want to cause any more trouble.

298
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:44,940
Hello.

299
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:45,940
Is Xiaobei here?

300
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:49,940
Who are you?

301
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,940
I am Xiaobei's friend, Ma Shanbao's lawyer.

302
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:53,940
My surname is Zhou.

303
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:55,940
Who are you looking for?

304
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:57,940
He is looking for Xiaobei.

305
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,940
He said he is A'bao's lawyer.

306
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:00,940
Yes.

307
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,940
Ma Shanbao needs Xiaobei's help.

308
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:03,940
Help?

309
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:04,940
Help what?

310
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,940
A'bao was caught by the police.

311
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:08,940
That's it.

312
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:09,940
I am sorry.

313
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:10,940
I am sorry.

314
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:11,940
I am sorry.

315
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:12,940
Are you done?

316
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:13,940
That's it.

317
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:16,940
I need Xiaobei to tell me where the car he stole from Ma Shanbao.

318
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:17,940
What did you say?

319
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:18,940
Steal the car?

320
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:20,940
What are you talking about?

321
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:21,940
What lawyer?

322
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,940
I knew you were a cop at first sight.

323
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:24,940
It's not like that.

324
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:25,940
You go in first.

325
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:26,940
Let me talk to Xiaobei.

326
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:27,940
You go in. Don't let Xiaobei come out.

327
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,940
Xiaobei, Ma Shanbao needs your help.

328
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:30,940
Get out.

329
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,940
Only you can help Ma Shanbao.

330
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:33,940
Get out.

331
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,940
Xiaobei, don't be afraid.

332
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:36,940
I am here.

333
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:37,940
Get out.

334
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:40,940
There is a cop here.

335
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:42,940
Get out.

336
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:46,940
Get out.

337
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:52,940
Don't let me see you again.

338
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:06,940
Get out.

339
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:07,940
Get out.

340
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:12,940
Get out.

341
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:19,940
Why are you sitting here?

342
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,940
Are you going to school tomorrow?

343
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:25,940
Don't worry about this.

344
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,940
Just take care of yourself.

345
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,940
How are you going to tell the principal?

346
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:31,940
Let's talk inside.

347
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,940
Coach, he is innocent.

348
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,940
He took my wine and didn't let me drink it.

349
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:38,940
He didn't drink it with me.

350
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:39,940
It's my fault.

351
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:40,940
I am sorry.

352
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:41,940
I am innocent.

353
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,940
What are you doing? Why are you so nervous?

354
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:44,940
Sit down.

355
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:45,940
Sit down first.

356
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,940
If you want to talk, you can talk to me.

357
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,940
I shouldn't drink when I am unhappy.

358
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:52,940
I have already got you involved.

359
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,940
I don't want to involve others.

360
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:58,940
I promise you.

361
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:01,940
I will only listen to what Coach Yu wants to say tomorrow.

362
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,940
But I also want you to promise me.

363
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:04,940
If you want to drink next time,

364
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:05,940
you can ask me to accompany you.

365
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,940
Okay?

366
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:12,940
Here.

367
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:13,940
Pick up your things.

368
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,940
I want to check the record.

369
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,940
Is there a white old style running pool

370
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:32,940
that has been reported to us

371
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:33,940
after that day or the day after that?

372
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:38,940
Yes.

373
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:39,940
Yes.

374
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:40,940
That's it.

375
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,940
Please inform me as soon as you have news.

376
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:45,940
Okay. Thank you.

377
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:48,940
I am sorry.

378
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:51,940
I totally don't remember.

379
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,940
You totally don't remember me, right?

380
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,940
After you joined the crime team,

381
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,940
you always break the promise every time.

382
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,940
I really don't know how Brother Shi can bear it.

383
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,940
Because he also often breaks the promise.

384
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:04,940
I believe you.

385
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,940
I am not lying to you.

386
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:07,940
It's true.

387
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:08,940
I don't want to talk to you.

388
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:10,940
Don't be angry.

389
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:12,940
Have you eaten?

390
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:14,940
Of course I have.

391
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:16,940
I can't get sick.

392
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,940
I have to take care of patients when I go back to the hospital.

393
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,940
I have to take care of you when I go back home.

394
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:24,940
Don't deny it.

395
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:27,940
Here.

396
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:28,940
What is this?

397
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,940
Do you remember you told me

398
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,940
that your stomach medicine doesn't work now?

399
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:34,940
I have put new medicine for you.

400
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:35,940
I am warning you.

401
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,940
If you don't change these terrible habits,

402
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,940
it will be useless.

403
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,940
Nurse Tang, you have already left work.

404
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,940
Don't always treat me like your patient.

405
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,940
You always talk about me.

406
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:49,940
Okay?

407
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,940
I guess you haven't eaten.

408
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:52,940
Here.

409
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,940
I cooked porridge.

410
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:55,940
Don't worry about whether it tastes good or not.

411
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,940
The most important thing is

412
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,940
it is easy to digest and good for the stomach.

413
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,940
It must be delicious.

414
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,940
It must be delicious.

415
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:05,940
Of course.

416
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:06,940
But,

417
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,940
you have been in the northern district for only two years.

418
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,940
Why are you getting more and more nagging?

419
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,940
Be careful.

420
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:14,940
No one wants it.

421
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:18,940
I seem to be nagging only to you.

422
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:23,940
But I also think

423
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:24,940
after two years of leaving,

424
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:25,940
I have come back here.

425
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:29,940
The eastern district has really changed a lot.

426
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,940
It is much more complicated.

427
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:33,940
Which department are you in?

428
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:34,940
S.U.

429
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,940
Household and Security Department.

430
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:38,940
You are a gang.

431
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,940
People from the Han family are less in touch.

432
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:43,940
I am nurse Tang.

433
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:46,940
If you don't contact me, you don't have to work.

434
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,940
Anyway, listen to me.

435
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,940
Don't deal with these people.

436
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:51,940
Okay?

437
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:52,940
Be careful.

438
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,940
I know.

439
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:03,940
I will go.

440
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:17,940
I bought you breakfast.

441
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,940
Did I wake you up?

442
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,940
I didn't sleep all night.

443
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,940
Did your daughter cry again in the middle of the night?

444
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,940
I looked for you all day yesterday.

445
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,940
Why didn't you answer my phone?

446
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,940
I went out to collect goods.

447
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:35,940
No signal?

448
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,940
I met Qi Changrong.

449
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:39,940
Why did you look for him?

450
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,940
He asked me to see him.

451
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,940
Did he do anything to you?

452
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,940
Did he kill you?

453
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,940
You and I have two children.

454
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:53,940
He still won't give up.

455
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,940
You always think about such boring things.

456
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:04,940
Why?

457
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:06,940
About A'bao.

458
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:12,940
What did he say?

459
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:27,940
Get off the car.

460
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:28,940
Get off the car.

461
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:31,940
A'wei, what's up?

462
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:33,940
Do you take me as a friend?

463
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:34,940
As a brother?

464
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,940
Put the gun down first, okay?

465
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:38,940
What are you talking about?

466
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,940
What's the difference between you and those bastards?

467
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:42,940
I want to help you.

468
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,940
I have two children at home.

469
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:47,940
Do you want to pay for their two children?

470
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:48,940
Let me explain first.

471
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,940
What do you want to explain?

472
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,940
Keep talking nonsense.

473
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,940
You know that the car hit someone.

474
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,940
You know who hit you.

475
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,940
Why did you drag me into the water?

476
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,940
I don't want to drag you into the water.

477
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:03,940
Okay.

478
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:12,940
Okay.

479
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:14,940
You pointed the gun at me first.

480
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:16,940
Let me continue, okay?

481
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:21,940
Yes.

482
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,940
My car hit someone.

483
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,940
That's why I caused so much trouble.

484
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:30,940
A'wei, I'm sorry.

485
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:31,940
I lied to you.

486
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,940
From the car hit someone,

487
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:38,940
I don't remember how many people I lied to.

488
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,940
Because the one who hit someone

489
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:43,940
was Qin Yiwei.

490
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:50,940
Later,

491
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,940
how did A'bao's matter develop like this?

492
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:54,940
I don't know why.

493
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,940
If you think I should die now,

494
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,940
it's reasonable for you to shoot.

495
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:05,940
Do you know who Yiwei hit?

496
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,940
I just know that I did so many things.

497
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,940
I sentenced Han Kuilong to jail.

498
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,940
If my son is also in jail, what will you do?

499
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,940
He must be so upset.

500
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,940
You also have a son.

501
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,940
If it were you, what would you do?

502
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:23,940
Now you shoot,

503
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:25,940
two people will die.

504
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:31,940
I'm sorry.

505
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,940
You don't have to be so cruel.

506
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,940
I didn't do anything.

507
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,940
Your wife doesn't know about this.

508
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:16,940
That night,

509
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,940
she saw A'bao drive away.

510
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,940
Will she tell Qi Changrong?

511
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:25,940
She didn't say anything.

512
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,940
What should we do in the future?

513
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:35,940
You are a father.

514
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,940
I'm also a father.

515
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:40,940
I have two children.

516
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:44,940
Give me some time.

517
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:46,940
I will definitely think of a way.

518
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:48,940
I will never let

519
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:49,940
two children get hurt.

520
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:02,940
Mr. Qin,

521
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,940
most of your funds are made of deposit.

522
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:05,940
If you take it out now,

523
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,940
the fees are very high and not very cost-effective.

524
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,940
But I really need money.

525
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:13,940
You also have a joint account with Qin Yiwei.

526
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:14,940
This is Huoqi Village.

527
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:15,940
You can't take money from it.

528
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:18,940
Okay.

529
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:19,940
I'll take money from this account.

530
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:20,940
I want cash.

531
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:32,940
Uncle.

532
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:35,940
Is mom at home?

533
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:37,940
Mom is inside.

534
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,940
Son, go play with sister.

535
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:48,940
Go.

536
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:02,940
You said yesterday

537
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,940
you would get A'bao out.

538
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,940
Now you suddenly asked him to confess.

539
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:08,940
What happened?

540
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,940
I didn't expect A'bao to be so unlucky this time.

541
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:16,940
He followed Qi Changrong

542
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:18,940
and hit the flag of the old city district.

543
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,940
Now he has to bear all the crimes.

544
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:23,940
Whether he confesses or not,

545
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,940
A'bao is now very difficult to escape.

546
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:27,940
What should I do?

547
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:28,940
The car owner came to me.

548
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:30,940
He said as long as A'bao confessed,

549
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:32,940
he could give you enough money

550
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:34,940
to live.

551
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:35,940
He?

552
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:36,940
Who is he?

553
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:37,940
Xue.

554
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:39,940
If you really want to save this family,

555
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:40,940
don't ask so much.

556
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:43,940
I promise you

557
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:44,940
I will give you the money.

558
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,940
I will take care of your life

559
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:48,940
until A'bao is out of prison.

560
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:52,940
But I can't let A'bao suffer like this.

561
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,940
I can't let A'bao suffer like this.

562
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,940
I can't let A'bao suffer like this.

563
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:07,940
To be honest,

564
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:08,940
it's not the first time

565
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,940
A'bao has stolen cars and things.

566
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:11,940
When he grows up,

567
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:12,940
he may help Qi Changrong

568
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:15,940
to smuggle and poison

569
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:17,940
to make money.

570
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:19,940
His future result

571
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:21,940
may also be in prison.

572
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:23,940
Why don't you

573
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:25,940
use this prison

574
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,940
to change your fate?

575
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:30,940
With money,

576
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:32,940
you can train the other three kids.

577
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:34,940
With money,

578
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:36,940
A'bao can start over

579
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:37,940
after he's out.

580
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:39,940
Most importantly,

581
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:40,940
with money,

582
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,940
you can leave the old city.

583
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:52,940
You have a child.

584
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:54,940
You need money to treat him.

585
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:57,940
If you also get married,

586
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,940
what about the three kids?

587
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:23,940
How is the man

588
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:24,940
who was hit by a car?

589
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:31,940
He's still in the hospital

590
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:33,940
for an accident.

591
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:36,940
Do you know who he is?

592
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:43,940
I don't know.

593
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:52,940
I don't know.

594
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:13,940
Judge Qin.

595
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:16,940
I heard that

596
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:17,940
Judge Su is also on the list

597
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,940
of the president's nomination.

598
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:20,940
Recently,

599
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,940
he was exposed to a scandal.

600
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:24,940
I heard that he wanted to resign.

601
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:26,940
If it's true,

602
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,940
there's only you and me left.

603
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:31,940
A few days ago,

604
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,940
I saw the police searching your car.

605
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:34,940
It seemed to be quite nervous.

606
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:35,940
Nothing, right?

607
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:38,940
That madam

608
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,940
has a good relationship with you.

609
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:42,940
She's really not sensible.

610
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:44,940
She did such a small thing

611
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:45,940
when she was so sensitive.

612
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:47,940
Everyone

613
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:48,940
has high expectations

614
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,940
for the president of the court.

615
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:52,940
I will respect the court's decision.

616
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:54,940
Sometimes,

617
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,940
you really don't have a choice.

618
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:58,940
I think

619
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:00,940
you should be stable

620
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:01,940
and sit in the position

621
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:02,940
you should sit in.

622
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,940
This is a wise choice.

623
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:18,940
Qi, Xiao Xue is here.

624
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:20,940
Qi.

625
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:21,940
Xiao Xue?

626
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:22,940
Qi,

627
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,940
I beg you to help me.

628
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,940
Help me to see A'Bao.

629
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:27,940
They won't let me see him.

630
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:29,940
Didn't he hire a lawyer?

631
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:31,940
There's no way to hire a lawyer.

632
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:34,940
What about Luo Wei?

633
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:35,940
He's A'Bao's uncle.

634
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:37,940
He can't help you either.

635
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:39,940
Qi,

636
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:40,940
I beg you.

637
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:43,940
For the sake of everyone

638
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:44,940
who used to be neighbors,

639
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:45,940
please help me.

640
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:46,940
Okay?

641
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:48,940
Qi.

642
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:52,940
Qi,

643
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:53,940
A'Bao is locked inside.

644
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:54,940
I'm worried about him.

645
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,940
Please help me, Qi.

646
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:00,940
Qi.

647
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,940
I'm most afraid of women begging me.

648
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:06,940
Okay.

649
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,940
I have my brother in prison.

650
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:09,940
I'll try to help you.

651
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:11,940
Remember to pay him

652
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:12,940
some hard money.

653
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:13,940
I know.

654
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:15,940
Thank you, Qi.

655
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:18,940
Okay.

656
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:45,940
A'Bao.

657
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:46,940
Mom.

658
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:48,940
Mom.

659
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:49,940
Mom.

660
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:50,940
How did you get in?

661
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,940
I gave them some money

662
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,940
to talk for ten minutes.

663
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:58,940
Mom, where did you get the money?

664
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:01,940
Mom.

665
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:02,940
Mom.

666
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,940
Don't worry about the money.

667
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:05,940
But...

668
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:07,940
Mom,

669
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:08,940
it's okay.

670
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:09,940
What did you tell me?

671
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:11,940
Mom.

672
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,940
I hope you'll forgive me.

673
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:18,940
Just treat this family as a help.

674
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:27,940
A'Bao.

675
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:29,940
We have no power

676
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,940
and no way to fight with them.

677
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:33,940
We're not admitting our sins.

678
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:34,940
We're admitting our illness.

679
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:35,940
A'Bao.

680
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,940
Your father closed his eyes

681
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:42,940
and left nothing behind.

682
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:44,940
Mom.

683
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:48,940
I'm still sick.

684
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:52,940
If you're in prison,

685
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:54,940
how do you think

686
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:55,940
this family will survive?

687
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,940
But if you don't

688
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:05,940
do this for nothing,

689
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:07,940
you can help this family

690
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:08,940
find a way out

691
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:09,940
and a hope.

692
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:14,940
Look.

693
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,940
My brother got the first place this time.

694
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:23,940
The teacher told me

695
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:24,940
he really hopes

696
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,940
he can go to a better school.

697
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:29,940
So did your sister.

698
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:32,940
If you have money,

699
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,940
your mother's diabetes can be cured.

700
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:41,940
You can buy a new one.

701
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:43,940
But I'm sorry

702
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:48,940
for what I said.

703
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:13,940
The teacher told me

704
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:14,940
he really hopes

705
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,940
he can go to a better school.

706
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:17,940
Let's go.

707
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:42,940
Now, our dean

708
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:43,940
will tell you

709
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:44,940
the result

710
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:45,940
and the suggestion.

711
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:47,940
Coach Yu Xin

712
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:48,940
is a bad example

713
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,940
of tolerating students drinking.

714
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:51,940
He violates the principle

715
00:36:51,940 --> 00:37:07,640
of the

716
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:08,940
But I think

717
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:09,940
we can listen to

718
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:10,940
Coach Yu's explanation first.

719
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:12,940
Coach Yu,

720
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:13,940
what do you want to say?

721
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:14,940
I'll say it again.

722
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:15,940
I saw Qin Yiwei

723
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:16,940
drinking in the school.

724
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:17,940
I immediately stopped him.

725
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,940
Did you drink with him?

726
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:20,940
No.

727
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:21,940
Then why don't

728
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,940
you listen to the person?

729
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:26,940
Coach, he didn't drink.

730
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:27,940
Only I drank.

731
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:29,940
As a teacher,

732
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:30,940
should you stop students from drinking?

733
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:31,940
I've already

734
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:32,940
taken away his bottle of wine.

735
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:33,940
It's still not a stop.

736
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:34,940
Am I supposed to beat him

737
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:35,940
to make it a stop?

738
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:37,940
Can I say something?

739
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:39,940
Judge Qi, please.

740
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:43,940
Actually, I came here

741
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:45,940
to thank Coach Yu.

742
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:48,940
Because Qin Yiwei

743
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:49,940
has a serious asthma.

744
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:51,940
If it didn't happen

745
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:53,940
when Coach Yu was here,

746
00:37:54,940 --> 00:38:04,280
he might have been in the

747
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,280
wrong.

748
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,280
I've made up my mind.

749
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,280
Judge Qin, please wait.

750
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,280
Coach.

751
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,280
Wait for me in the car.

752
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,280
What's wrong?

753
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,280
I think you need to

754
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,280
pay attention to

755
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,280
Qin Yiwei's psychological state.

756
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,280
It's normal for young people

757
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,280
to vent their anger after drinking.

758
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,280
But he has asthma.

759
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,280
I'm sorry.

760
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,280
Thank you for your concern.

761
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,280
My client has repeatedly shown

762
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,280
that he has nothing to do

763
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,280
with the case of

764
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,280
Zhao's escape in the traffic.

765
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,280
But the police

766
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,280
still didn't have

767
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,280
any solid evidence

768
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,280
to detain my client

769
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,280
for no reason.

770
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,280
It's totally unreasonable.

771
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,280
Obviously,

772
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,280
they are using illegal judicial procedures.

773
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,280
My client is innocent.

774
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,280
Just because he came from the old city district,

775
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,280
he has to be treated differently?

776
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,280
What did you find?

777
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,280
We found the detention center.

778
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,280
But we couldn't find the person's name.

779
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,280
The police blocked the door.

780
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,280
I don't care.

781
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,280
Anyway,

782
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,280
this bill must be paid back.

783
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,280
Two minutes.

784
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,280
All right.

785
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,280
Hello.

786
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,280
It's me.

787
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,280
Brother Qiang, what's up?

788
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,280
Help me to deal with someone.

789
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,280
I want him to die.

790
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,280
Who is it?

791
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,280
The people from the old city district.

792
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,280
I'm sorry.

793
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,280
I'm sorry.

794
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,280
I'm sorry.

795
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,280
I'm sorry.

796
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,280
I'm sorry.

797
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,280
Don't worry.

798
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,280
Is there a problem?

799
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,280
There should be.

800
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,280
God will give us a way out.

801
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,280
Don't open the door.

802
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,280
Do the job of parking with me in two years.

803
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,280
Don't touch drugs.

804
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,280
A'Bo.

805
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,280
You look so sad.

806
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,280
What's wrong?

807
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,280
Your mom came to see you?

808
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,280
You're laughing at me?

809
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,280
Listen to me.

810
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,280
There's no such thing as a palace in this world.

811
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,280
You're still laughing at me?

812
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,280
You're so noisy.

813
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,280
Fatty!

814
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,280
You're so noisy.

815
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,280
Get off.

816
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,280
I'll take a nap.

817
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,280
You go up.

818
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,280
Okay.

819
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,280
You go up.

820
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,280
Good night.

821
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,280
Good night.

822
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,280
Good night.

823
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,280
You sleep well.

824
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,280
Good night.

825
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,280
Good night.

826
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,280
Good night.

827
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,280
Good night.

828
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,880
Your heart cherishes the memory

829
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:03,280
Burnt, burned into millionaire

830
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,080
Left hurt, left over

831
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:09,040
Flawless fireworks

832
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:14,560
Reckless love is mutual

833
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:18,480
Dynamise of supre Does you turn

834
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,640
His eyes bathe in Special illusion

835
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:25,120
aún import Let none

836
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,640
Let none

837
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:30,120
The two lines

838
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:33,940
Whose cut 접종 is justas

839
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:34,980
Because we 32 think that we suffer the haul

840
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:39,600
We would be right to western

841
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:39,820
Look at Korea

842
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:42,680
But try it

843
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,400
I don't want to argue

844
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:51,180
Why don't you try

845
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:52,760
You can do it

846
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:58,800
The flick is like a man

847
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:04,280
But my heart is in pain

848
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,280
I know I can't live without you

849
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:09,280
I know I can't live without you

850
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,280
Looking at the flat people

851
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,280
But I am rational

852
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,280
I'm so stubborn

853
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:19,280
Why can't I be silent

854
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,280
I can't turn back

855
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:24,280
I'm so confused

856
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,280
But the road is good

857
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:31,280
I know I can't live without you

858
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:36,280
But my heart is in pain
