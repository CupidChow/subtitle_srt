1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,520
In the past few years, the violence between the various black social groups

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,240
plus the police last year, including the police and the procurator,

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,320
and many public officials have been attacked

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,160
has led to the loss of Haogang, which is known as the East Mondica

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,560
Nine months ago, after the black-social background businessman Han Guilong was sentenced to death

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,200
Haogang seems to have recovered its peaceful and stable

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,800
But since this morning

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,880
The black-social group that belongs to Han Guilong

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,480
There have been multiple collective fighting incidents between the old and the new

10
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,280
I believe the most popular question is

11
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,320
When will Haogang be able to gain peace forever?

12
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,280
Police! Run!

13
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,480
Don't move!

14
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,520
Stop!

15
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,480
Kneel down, Wu Qi!

16
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,280
Don't run!

17
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,080
Kneel down!

18
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,280
Hurry up!

19
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:08,880
Don't run!

20
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,080
Kneel down!

21
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,280
Don't run!

22
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,480
Kneel down!

23
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,680
Stop!

24
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,880
Stop!

25
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,480
Stop!

26
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,680
Stop!

27
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,280
Stop!

28
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,880
Stop!

29
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,480
Stop!

30
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,080
Stop!

31
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,680
Stop!

32
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,280
Stop!

33
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,480
Stop!

34
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,480
Stop!

35
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,080
Stop!

36
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,280
Don't move!

37
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,880
Let's go!

38
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,080
Hurry!

39
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,280
Episode 18

40
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,320
I'm going to the police station later.

41
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,560
Why?

42
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,280
Someone found our car.

43
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,120
They found it?

44
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,040
Where did you drive it?

45
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:46,800
Anyway,

46
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,960
our car is missing.

47
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,760
We called the police and they found it.

48
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,880
We're going to the police station to get the car back.

49
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,560
This is a normal procedure.

50
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,720
Don't worry.

51
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,480
They found the car

52
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,040
and they knew it was mine.

53
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,800
They only found the car.

54
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,560
They didn't say the car hit someone.

55
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,320
I'll take you to school after breakfast.

56
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,360
Just like usual.

57
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,080
Don't be afraid.

58
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,760
You go on eating.

59
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,040
I'll be back soon.

60
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,200
Go.

61
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,280
Oh no.

62
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,640
The police have taken the car.

63
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:41,760
I know.

64
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,240
Jing Shu informed me.

65
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,520
Why did they look for you?

66
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,760
That car is yours?

67
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,640
How could they take my car?

68
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,080
The guy who drove the car for us last night

69
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,000
is Ma Shanbao.

70
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,400
He's my cousin's son.

71
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,400
The police found his mother this morning.

72
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,480
Why did the police take my car?

73
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,240
Why did you take the car?

74
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,000
Why is it a car?

75
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:07,920
Wei,

76
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,600
don't keep asking me questions.

77
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,320
I'll help you.

78
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,840
There must be something wrong with the car.

79
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:12,960
Tell me first.

80
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,680
Why did they take my car?

81
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,040
I don't know if Baochuan is unlucky or taking the wrong path.

82
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,400
He happened to meet Qi Changlong

83
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,240
and Han Kuilun's men in Ju Zudong.

84
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,160
His car

85
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,440
was blocked by the police.

86
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,400
They blocked the right way.

87
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,400
Now the police

88
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,880
want to sue him for stealing the car

89
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,240
and driving without evidence.

90
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:33,880
Then,

91
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,040
what do you think we should do now?

92
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,840
What else can we do?

93
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,040
Let's keep him here.

94
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,040
Does he have anything to do with Qi Changlong?

95
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,640
Did he commit a crime?

96
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,880
Those who live in the old city

97
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,720
will have something to do with Qi Changlong.

98
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,560
Baochuan is a little muddled,

99
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,880
but he won't do anything that will cause trouble.

100
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,800
He is a good boy.

101
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,160
We must find a way to protect him.

102
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,720
I'll help him find a lawyer.

103
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,200
Shouldn't you

104
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,240
seek legal aid in this situation?

105
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,920
Lawyer Zhou Luo Wen

106
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,120
used to be my student.

107
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,040
What can he do for me?

108
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,760
How much does the lawyer charge?

109
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,280
Hello, Lawyer Zhou Luo Wen.

110
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,920
Hello, Luo Wen.

111
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,560
Master,

112
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,800
you want me to be a driver?

113
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,800
I'm free now.

114
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,000
I have nothing to do at the firm.

115
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:33,960
No.

116
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,400
I want to introduce you a client.

117
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:36,880
Really?

118
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,400
Yes.

119
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,640
The car theft case

120
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,360
that happened last night

121
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,480
will be contacted by Mr. Cao.

122
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,680
Mr. Cao?

123
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,800
Yes, Cao Wei Er.

124
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,400
I gave him your phone number.

125
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,120
Master,

126
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,960
I'm sorry.

127
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,760
I'm sorry.

128
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,800
Master,

129
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,960
this is my first time taking on a case.

130
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,200
If I encounter any problems,

131
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,200
will you help me?

132
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,560
Okay.

133
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,240
Of course.

134
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,120
If you have any problems,

135
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:03,960
feel free to contact me.

136
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,800
Goodbye, Master.

137
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,400
Okay.

138
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,240
Call him again.

139
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,840
Also,

140
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,120
you must inform your nephew

141
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,680
not to say anything

142
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,880
before the lawyer comes.

143
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,320
You know these things?

144
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:21,920
I know.

145
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,240
I'll leave now.

146
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:24,840
Okay.

147
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,400
Mr. Qin,

148
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,440
are you going to court directly?

149
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,680
I'll send my son back to school.

150
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,440
Then I'll go to the police station in the eastern district.

151
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,520
It's my duty to serve my idol.

152
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,480
Be careful.

153
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,800
I know.

154
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,280
A car accident

155
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,920
happened yesterday.

156
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,120
We should be careful

157
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,320
when we're on the road.

158
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,520
We'll report to you.

159
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,840
The police investigation of Zhao Shi's escape case

160
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,600
has been said to have been a breakthrough.

161
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,760
But there are still

162
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,880
related news reports.

163
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,760
The injured still haven't been released.

164
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,000
Zhao Shi's escape case?

165
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,640
I don't know who

166
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,200
could do such a cruel thing.

167
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,880
Aren't you afraid of being punished?

168
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,560
Stop the car.

169
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,080
Dad,

170
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,040
there's a bus stop here.

171
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,000
I want to take the bus.

172
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,080
Please stop the car.

173
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:19,840
Okay.

174
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,760
주고

175
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,760
Can it be a 02 dannum?

176
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,840
Is he back?

177
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,800
Go directly to the police station.

178
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,480
Okay.

179
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,000
Turn off the V-m건.

180
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,600
Okay.

181
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,760
What do you think about yesterday's case?

182
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,000
In fact, for women belt,

183
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,280
pretend power,

184
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,280
and court,

185
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,640
They all

186
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,200
often happen 이게였 Leute101m

187
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,200
It's common.

188
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,560
I guess you're concerned about

189
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,400
the case of Han Gang, Zhao Shi and Tao Yi.

190
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,880
What do you think of the report of

191
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,880
the Chief Investigator, Mr. Shi?

192
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,640
Han Kuilong is in jail now.

193
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,600
Qi Changrong must want to take this chance to take the throne.

194
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,720
But Han Kuilong has been in power for so many years.

195
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,200
It's not easy for Qi Changrong to take him down.

196
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,560
And it will be troublesome.

197
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:22,880
Right.

198
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,320
The Chief Investigator only cares about two words.

199
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,680
Stability.

200
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,480
It's simple.

201
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,360
Let's give Han Kuilong some time to think.

202
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,440
Let him go out and see his son.

203
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,560
Let him calm down.

204
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,360
Right?

205
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,040
We'll talk about the rest later.

206
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,840
It's a small matter for the residents.

207
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,160
Just take it as a waste of food for the warehouse.

208
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,640
But Zhao Shi and Tao Yi of Han Gang

209
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,840
really need to be careful.

210
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,720
I think,

211
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,560
they should know their place first.

212
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,880
Then they can find the Emperor Dilu for correct Youing.

213
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,080
That'll be good for them.

214
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:00,680
Relatives.

215
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:01,880
Someone's coming back.

216
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,160
Tell me the truth.

217
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:12,900
Why did weцион the

218
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,320
floating Company complicated clearly yesterday?

219
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,080
When there was many donating people

220
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,280
It's easier to close when you go out.

221
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,760
Is it good?

222
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,880
It's very fragrant.

223
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,440
The entrance is very soft.

224
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,440
What's wrong?

225
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,240
Judge Qin, you're so lucky.

226
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,840
If you had reported ten cars in the East District,

227
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,920
you couldn't find any.

228
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,480
You found this one overnight.

229
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,880
Look.

230
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,160
When we found the car,

231
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,200
the headlight and the door were damaged.

232
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,880
If there were no damages before the report,

233
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,760
you should write it down.

234
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,080
There were no damages before the report.

235
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,560
Then you sign it.

236
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,440
Okay.

237
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,880
It's just a routine.

238
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,120
We found that young man.

239
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,680
He drove without a driver's license.

240
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,320
It's good that he didn't crash your car.

241
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,160
Can I take the car back?

242
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:02,960
Yes.

243
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,320
Do you have a car key?

244
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,480
Do you need a tow truck?

245
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:06,720
Yes.

246
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,000
Thank you.

247
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,720
Judge Qin.

248
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,160
Is the one who competes with you

249
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,800
Judge Lu Weide?

250
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,800
I think so.

251
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,880
If you need any help later,

252
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,080
feel free to ask me.

253
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,120
God of Law,

254
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,280
we don't want to be fooled by a mouse.

255
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,000
I'll try my best.

256
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,800
But I'm still a capable man.

257
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,680
Thank you. Bye.

258
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,160
Judge Qin, your car.

259
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,320
After you take the car back,

260
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,360
remember to take the car keys.

261
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,920
And the tow truck headlight.

262
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,920
It's the safest.

263
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,480
Thank you.

264
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,320
What's wrong with you?

265
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,000
Relax.

266
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,440
Follow my rhythm.

267
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,120
Thank you.

268
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:07,880
Here.

269
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,760
Feeling better?

270
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,800
Why didn't you come to the competition yesterday?

271
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:34,680
Let's go.

272
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,760
By the way, coach.

273
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,920
I forgot to bring my notes.

274
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,200
I'll go first.

275
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,160
Wait a minute.

276
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,340
Ad讓

277
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,080
Brother Long, you have a guess.

278
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,640
I see other people working outside.

279
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:06,720
Right.

280
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,580
There's no need to be so

281
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,700
白

282
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,580
First a cup of coffee, Brother Long.

283
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,680
Take your men home and have a rest.

284
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,120
You don't need to be so aggressive.

285
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,760
You're not sure about anything.

286
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,040
It's a waste.

287
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,480
Here.

288
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,880
Mr. Hu, what's the order from the superior?

289
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,480
The person who caught him yesterday,

290
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,040
whether it's Qi Changrong or Han Kuilong,

291
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,320
let him go.

292
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,160
What?

293
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,760
He caught three cars of people and came back.

294
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,200
He hurt and destroyed people.

295
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,200
He even broke into some new drugstores.

296
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,400
You want me to let him go?

297
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,080
Have you seen me drink coffee?

298
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,200
Mr. Hu, stop making me a fool.

299
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,920
The person who drinks coffee made the decision.

300
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,760
They said they don't want to make any trouble

301
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,160
by making peace.

302
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,240
Isn't this a very decent gesture?

303
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:21,320
We just do our best.

304
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,400
That's what we talk to the boss here.

305
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,520
I'm hoping the boss can help us out.

306
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Besides,

307
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,320
is it really possible

308
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,840
for you to make this entrance alone?

309
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,080
Miss,

310
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,240
I'm afraid he has wholeheartedly

311
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,440
considered his future.

312
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,800
Bai Which is designed course

313
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,720
is reasonably quiet around the east

314
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,360
now.

315
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,020
With such a lot of prof dao we AMP

316
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,720
truthfully and deviantly

317
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,320
pay a little respect.

318
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,400
Why did you come here

319
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,240
after talking with Da-si?

320
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,680
Hang Kui-long's son is a human.

321
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,800
He's not the one who died in his hands.

322
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
How could you sympathize with him

323
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,040
and make a deal with him?

324
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,920
If you put it this way,

325
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,240
isn't Hang Kang more deserved?

326
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,360
Will you let the murderer

327
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,720
who hit him go?

328
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,760
I know you're angry.

329
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,080
But we've made a deal.

330
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,720
We can't hurt our feelings

331
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,760
because of work, right?

332
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,840
But back to the point,

333
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,600
if your Central Security Team

334
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,800
needs our intelligence department's help,

335
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,560
I don't mind

336
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:37,320
sharing my personal feelings.

337
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,200
Then may I ask

338
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,800
why you're so indifferent to the company?

339
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,400
Or is it the company's business?

340
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,520
What I mean is

341
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,760
it's not a big deal

342
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,720
if it's about Chairman Tang.

343
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,200
See you at the usual place.

344
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,320
Judge Qin,

345
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,560
we have half an hour left.

346
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,720
And I want to say

347
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,360
Judge Shen is here.

348
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,000
I've retired.

349
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,240
I'm no longer a judge.

350
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,680
I'm here as

351
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,320
Judge Qin's mother-in-law.

352
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,680
Why didn't you inform me in advance

353
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,680
and I came here myself?

354
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,880
It's my fault.

355
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,280
I shouldn't have come here.

356
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,400
I'm tired.

357
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,720
Should I come back tomorrow?

358
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:48,720
It's fine.

359
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,800
I'll leave you two alone.

360
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,400
Sit down.

361
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,120
What's the matter?

362
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,000
Someone stole the car.

363
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,520
Why didn't you tell me?

364
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,000
Someone stole the car.

365
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,360
But now it's back.

366
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,800
I don't want to alert you.

367
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,080
The car was registered under my name.

368
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,320
I only found out

369
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,160
when the transportation agency informed me.

370
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,640
Sorry.

371
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,840
I don't care about the details.

372
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,240
I only found out after the trial.

373
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,840
Don't forget.

374
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,120
Lan Lan died.

375
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,000
You haven't given me an explanation.

376
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,240
Before I start the trial,

377
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,720
let's not discuss this issue, okay?

378
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,240
I'm just worried about Weiwei.

379
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,760
You're so busy with work.

380
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,280
Someone stole the car.

381
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,080
Who dares to steal a judge's car?

382
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,120
Weiwei is fine.

383
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,120
The car is back.

384
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,600
I'm really in a hurry.

385
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,800
Let's make an appointment again.

386
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,600
I'm leaving now.

387
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,320
Take care.

388
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:46,840
Bye.

389
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,400
Bye.

390
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,040
Bye.

391
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:48,760
Bye.

392
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,600
Bye.

393
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,400
Bye.

394
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,280
Bye.

395
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,160
Bye.

396
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:52,960
Bye.

397
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,720
Bye.

398
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,320
Bye.

399
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,040
Bye.

400
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:55,800
Bye.

401
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,600
Bye.

402
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,600
Bye.

403
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,480
Bye.

404
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,280
Bye.

405
00:18:59,280 --> 00:18:59,560
Bye.

406
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,120
Bye.

407
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:00,840
Bye.

408
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,440
Bye.

409
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,400
Bye.

410
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,280
Madam.

411
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,760
I can't figure out anything.

412
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,280
That guy is not willing to tell me.

413
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,360
He is from the old city.

414
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,680
He stole the car.

415
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,280
He is suspected of being a member of Qi Changrong.

416
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,520
I don't understand.

417
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,440
There are so many cars on the street.

418
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,520
Why did he steal the car of Judge Qin's family?

419
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,520
Go on asking.

420
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,520
His lawyer is here.

421
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,360
He has been waiting for hours.

422
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,400
Let him wait a little longer.

423
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,280
Is it his right to see a lawyer?

424
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,120
Let him see him.

425
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,200
Okay.

426
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:31,840
Madam.

427
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,160
We found something on the scene.

428
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,560
The witness group found

429
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,640
a mark that doesn't belong to his car.

430
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,040
It's probably left by two cars

431
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,080
when they collided.

432
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,880
Can they find out

433
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,440
which car it is through these marks?

434
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,920
We can only tell if it's an European car

435
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,240
or a Japanese car.

436
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,560
Through the car head lights that were found on the scene,

437
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,000
the witness group said it might be a Japanese car.

438
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,080
But we need to find the car that collided with a motorcycle

439
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,960
to verify it after the witness test.

440
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,880
You said it was a Japanese car.

441
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,960
Plus, there are collision marks.

442
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,080
And we found the car head lights on the scene.

443
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:05,720
Yes, madam.

444
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:12,920
I'm sorry.

445
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,800
There's a police officer at the school.

446
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,000
I... I'm leaving.

447
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,680
Hello.

448
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:38,600
Yes.

449
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,840
I'm the student's parent.

450
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,600
I saw a police officer

451
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,040
and I don't know what happened.

452
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,840
I'm sorry to call the police.

453
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,480
Okay. Thank you.

454
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:55,640
Come in.

455
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,240
Judge Qin,

456
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,200
Tang Ducha is here.

457
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,560
Tang Ducha, what's up?

458
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,120
Judge Qin,

459
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,680
where's your car?

460
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,160
The doctor said

461
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,440
your brother's condition is stable for the time being.

462
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,600
But his condition is very serious.

463
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,240
The most important thing is

464
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,800
whether he can wake up.

465
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,200
My son Han Kuilong won't die so easily.

466
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,840
He will get better.

467
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,320
Dad,

468
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,760
I don't think

469
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,400
your brother's death is an accident.

470
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,800
You need to take good care of your brother.

471
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,240
Don't worry about anything else.

472
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,640
The most important thing is

473
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,120
don't act rashly.

474
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,520
It must be done by Qin Changhou and his men.

475
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,360
That's why they left your brother

476
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,720
on the roadside like garbage.

477
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,040
No one else dares to do that except them.

478
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,920
Do what you like.

479
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,240
In the future, I will

480
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,080
do this for your brother.

481
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,200
You don't know much.

482
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,880
After he wakes up,

483
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,400
he will know what to do.

484
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,200
I will be your brother.

485
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,440
Dad,

486
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,320
I don't want to get involved in anything.

487
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,120
I just want to tell you

488
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,760
that he's not just your son.

489
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,240
He's my big brother too.

490
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,760
I went to check on him.

491
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,840
It's possible that he was left by the man who hurt my brother.

492
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:41,880
Okay.

493
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,000
Leave it to Lin Yi.

494
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,800
He knows what to do.

495
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,200
Leave it to the police.

496
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,400
Let them do what they should do.

497
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,640
I don't believe them.

498
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,600
Do what I tell you to do.

499
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,720
Do you know why

500
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,920
I don't let you get involved

501
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,040
in case of emergency?

502
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,240
I have two sons.

503
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,040
I have to leave a way out.

504
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,000
Do you really think

505
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,520
the judge of Qin

506
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,960
can sentence me to jail

507
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,320
for my crime?

508
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,920
There are many things

509
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,600
that are not as simple as you think.

510
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,520
The headlight is broken.

511
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,560
But the scratch is not repaired yet.

512
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,440
Yes.

513
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,800
Because these scratches

514
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,360
need to be repaired in the garage.

515
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,560
I think it doesn't affect driving.

516
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,520
So I plan to repair it during the holiday.

517
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,920
Where is it repaired?

518
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,880
I'm not sure which garage.

519
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,160
Because the driver of the court arranged it.

520
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:05,720
Hello.

521
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,240
Go to the repair shop designated by the court right away.

522
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,120
There was a box of champagne in the box just now.

523
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,160
I found it in the garage.

524
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,040
I changed the headlight in their garage.

525
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,160
Take all the parts and fragments

526
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,200
back to me.

527
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,000
Okay.

528
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,960
Do I need to know something?

529
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,200
Judge Qin.

530
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,840
We suspect that

531
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,840
the car that hit Han Gang

532
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,520
is the one you reported to the police.

533
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,240
Did the suspect confess?

534
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:35,840
No.

535
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,920
He didn't say anything.

536
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,880
But we have enough evidence to show

537
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,080
that the possibility is very high.

538
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,560
So we need to detain your car

539
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,800
and let the witness department handle it.

540
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,120
Take the evidence and check the car.

541
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,360
Including the scratches on the car,

542
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,520
the fragments on the car,

543
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,720
and the oil stains.

544
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,920
Please sign here.

545
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,160
Give me the key.

546
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,960
I'll notify you when the witness department is done.

547
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,440
How long will it take?

548
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,320
Don't worry.

549
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,400
I'll tell them.

550
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,400
Make it quick.

551
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,680
Judge Qin.

552
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:06,800
Tang Duchen.

553
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,720
Why are you two together again?

554
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,120
Which idiot is so unlucky this time?

555
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,080
Judge Qin is the light of justice

556
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,360
in our court.

557
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,480
Now he has the support of the police.

558
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,680
He is also very famous.

559
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,600
Director of the police court,

560
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,920
you really have a high reputation.

561
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,120
You're overpraising me.

562
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,040
I won't bother you.

563
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,920
Let's have a fight.

564
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,720
Judge Qin.

565
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,840
There's one more thing I need to bother you.

566
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,360
You can tell me who hit you.

567
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,480
I can report him.

568
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,520
Did they threaten you and accuse you?

569
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,480
If you don't tell me,

570
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,320
they might hit harder next time.

571
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,480
As long as you stand up bravely,

572
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,120
I can report them for overusing violence.

573
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,120
No need.

574
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,400
I don't want to cause any trouble.

575
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,320
You still have other troubles?

576
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,760
Do you want me to take the investigation now?

577
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,760
If so,

578
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,200
we might need some legal documents.

579
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,360
It's not taking the investigation,

580
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,560
but assisting the investigation.

581
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,760
Come back with us to identify the suspect.

582
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,040
It's 10 o'clock in the morning.

583
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,760
Han Kuilong and Qi Changrong's men

584
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,760
fought hard to grab the floor.

585
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,760
More than ten people were injured, three were injured.

586
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,760
These are normal cases for them.

587
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,760
If Han Kuilong knows

588
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,760
Qi Changrong's men hurt his son,

589
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,560
I don't know how many people will die.

590
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,560
What can you do?

591
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,960
I can catch them as soon as possible.

592
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,960
I can catch the real murderer who hurt Han Gang

593
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,360
and punish him according to the law.

594
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,960
I can give Han Kuilong an explanation.

595
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,960
This is the best way to end this storm.

596
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,160
Otherwise,

597
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,160
this matter will only get worse.

598
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,360
I know you used to have a case of stealing cars

599
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,960
and stealing things.

600
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,760
But you were sentenced because you're not an adult.

601
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,360
It's all in the past.

602
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,160
You're eighteen years old.

603
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,760
They will sue you for being an adult.

604
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,360
Maybe I can use other ways to plead for you.

605
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,960
For example,

606
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,960
your family's situation.

607
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,760
I met your mother before I came here.

608
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,960
She was worried about you.

609
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,560
She kept asking me

610
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,560
when you could go home.

611
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,360
Your mother said

612
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,760
you can't be alone in the family.

613
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,960
Your father left

614
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,760
with three younger brothers and sisters.

615
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,760
You're the only one in the family.

616
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,760
I need you to tell me

617
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,560
all the things that happened

618
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,760
before you were caught by the police.

619
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,160
I need to know everything.

620
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,160
So I can help you.

621
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,560
I'm your lawyer.

622
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,760
My duty

623
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,560
is to protect your rights and interests.

624
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,560
You must remember

625
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,560
that you must have a lawyer

626
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,360
when you're interrogated.

627
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:57,760
And I

628
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,960
am your lawyer.

629
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,360
Do you understand?

630
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,560
Judge Qin,

631
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,760
if you need me to go through the process

632
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,160
and make an official application

633
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,560
to help you back to the investigation,

634
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,960
I can do the same.

635
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,560
Between you and me,

636
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,360
do we have to do this together?

637
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,960
The sooner we solve this matter,

638
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,960
the less innocent people will be hurt.

639
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,160
Judge Qin,

640
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,160
please do me a favor.

641
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:33,960
Okay.

642
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,160
Tang Dusha,

643
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,760
I hope you don't expose

644
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,560
my name and my identity.

645
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,960
Besides,

646
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,360
although the owner of the car is my mother-in-law,

647
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,360
you can come to me directly.

648
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,360
After all, she's a retired judge.

649
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,760
I don't want to disturb her.

650
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,160
I understand.

651
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:58,960
Judge Qin,

652
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,960
I know that

653
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,960
you'll be nervous

654
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,160
if this matter is related to Han Kuilong.

655
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,560
But I promise you

656
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,360
that all the information is confidential.

657
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,560
Just help identify the criminal.

658
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,360
Okay.

659
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,160
Are we going to the interrogation room now?

660
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:12,960
Of course.

661
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,760
The criminal can't see you in that room.

662
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,560
Don't worry.

663
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,360
Let's go.

664
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,560
Bastard!

665
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,360
Meng Huan!

666
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,360
You're not innocent!

667
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,760
I didn't steal the car!

668
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,560
You're not innocent!

669
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,760
I didn't steal the car!

670
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,560
Bastard!

671
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,360
I didn't!

672
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:35,960
Chief Han!

673
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,160
I didn't!

674
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,560
I didn't!

675
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,960
I didn't!

676
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,360
The police stole the car!

677
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,560
It's the police!

678
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,560
I didn't steal the car!

679
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,560
Let go!

680
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,160
Let go!

681
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:55,960
Sir, madam.

682
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:56,760
Sir, madam.

683
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,760
Bring the search warrant here.

684
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,160
Take him away.

685
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,960
I'm so sorry, Judge Qin.

686
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,960
I didn't scare you, right?

687
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,160
No.

688
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,360
That criminal seems to know you.

689
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,760
Do you remember

690
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,160
what situation he was in

691
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,560
and if you remember him?

692
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,960
I remember that day,

693
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,560
I left home at about ten o'clock.

694
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,560
He seemed to have appeared

695
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,560
across my house.

696
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,560
Okay.

697
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,160
I'm so sorry.

698
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,560
I'll take you home.

699
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:36,560
Here.

700
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,360
Weiwei.

701
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,160
Recently,

702
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,160
someone stole the car at home.

703
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,760
Do you know what happened?

704
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,160
My dad told you?

705
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,760
Of course, he wouldn't tell me anything.

706
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,160
But Uncle Yun saw that the car

707
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,560
was registered under my name,

708
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,760
so he informed me that the car was found.

709
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,360
Your district

710
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,960
was always fine.

711
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,160
Why would someone steal the car?

712
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,160
Weiwei.

713
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,560
If you have any problems,

714
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,760
you should tell me.

715
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,760
Do you know?

716
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,760
Don't be like your mom.

717
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,960
Grandma, don't say that again.

718
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,560
I'm leaving.

719
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,560
Weiwei.

720
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,360
Weiwei.

721
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,960
Why is that boy

722
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,160
so hurt on his face?

723
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:36,760
He went to the police.

724
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,560
It's just a theft.

725
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,360
Do we need to arrest him?

726
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,560
Judge Qin.

727
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,560
He's not an ordinary kid.

728
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:46,960
He's from the old city district.

729
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,560
Last month,

730
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,760
a subordinate of mine

731
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,560
was stabbed by a man from the old city district.

732
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,960
He's still in the hospital.

733
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,560
If he's driving the stolen car,

734
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,160
who can tell if he's armed

735
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,360
or not?

736
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,360
If it were you,

737
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,360
would you risk your life?

738
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,560
You can't be soft

739
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,960
when dealing with criminals.

740
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,160
Please park the car.

741
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,560
Weiwei.

742
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,560
Weiwei.

743
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,960
Don't go. Don't go.

744
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,360
There are police in the car.

745
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,360
Don't run. Don't run.

746
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:29,960
Dad.

747
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,960
The police came to the school for me.

748
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:33,760
I asked them.

749
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,560
It's a murder case.

750
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,360
It has nothing to do with you.

751
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,360
Don't be afraid.

752
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,160
If they come to arrest me,

753
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,360
you won't be involved.

754
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,160
Do you think it's okay to be arrested?

755
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,760
Will Han Kuilong let you go?

756
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,760
Will he let me go?

757
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,560
You've grown up.

758
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,760
Aren't you going to call the police?

759
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,360
The police are behind you.

760
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,160
What do you want to tell him?

761
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,160
Tell him. Tell him.

762
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,160
Tell him. Tell him.

763
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,360
Qian Yiwei.

764
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:00,560
What's wrong?

765
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,760
Why are you making your dad so angry?

766
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,360
Do you have something to say?

767
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,160
It's okay.

768
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,560
You've grown up.

769
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,160
Sometimes you don't know what he's thinking.

770
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,560
That's how young people are.

771
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:28,560
Get in the car.

772
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,960
Your Honor.

773
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,160
The defense believes that

774
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,360
my client Ma Shanbao

775
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,560
didn't steal the car.

776
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,160
He drove a car

777
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,960
that was not known to have been stolen.

778
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,960
So he was arrested.

779
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,560
And during the interrogation,

780
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,160
there was a reason to suspect that the police

781
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,360
used violence too much.

782
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,360
So the defense

783
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,760
kept the credibility of the charge.

784
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,360
Your Honor.

785
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,160
The defense lawyer

786
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,160
never questioned the police

787
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:04,960
before.

788
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,960
Now he deliberately suggests

789
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,360
that he obviously wants to

790
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,960
confuse the key points of the discussion.

791
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,160
Your Honor.

792
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,360
The defense insists on asking for a retrial.

793
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,560
Please transfer my client

794
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,160
to a safe place.

795
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,360
Your Honor.

796
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,160
I will meet your request.

797
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,760
Because I

798
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,360
received some information

799
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,560
that is not suitable

800
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,160
to be released in court.

801
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,760
Not suitable to be released in court?

802
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,760
Your Honor.

803
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,160
All the doubts

804
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,560
about the defense

805
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:39,160
have been raised.

806
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,960
I think

807
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,360
the defense

808
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,160
should do a seven-day

809
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,360
supplementary investigation.

810
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,560
By then,

811
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,360
the defense will be able to

812
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,560
prove that the evidence is correct.

813
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,560
After the investigation,

814
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,360
the trial will be reopened.

815
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,360
Ma Shanbao

816
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,360
will still be detained in the police station.

817
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,360
No further interrogation is allowed.

818
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:02,760
A'bao.

819
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:07,560
Mom.

820
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:07,960
A'bao, are you okay?

821
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:08,560
I'm fine.

822
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,160
I'm fine.

823
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,160
I'm fine. I'm fine.

824
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:10,760
Don't worry.

825
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:12,960
Don't say anything.

826
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,160
You'll be fine.

827
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,760
Why did you keep him for seven days?

828
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,560
Didn't you say

829
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,960
he would be home soon?

830
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,760
Ms. Chen.

831
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,360
Give me some time.

832
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,560
Please trust me.

833
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,360
Mom.

834
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,360
Mom.

835
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:11,960
Mayor.

836
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:35,840
It's quite dangerous La Killale

837
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,780
Why don't you go directly

838
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,580
Leave it well

839
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:40,780
I don't believe them.

840
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:44,660
Then I believe you.

841
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:46,860
I believe you.

842
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:04,220
Hello?

843
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:04,980
Judge Qin.

844
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,900
Sorry to bother you again.

845
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,620
Sorry to bother you again.

846
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,220
Please go ahead, Judge Tang.

847
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,500
I want to inform you

848
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:14,740
that your car needs to be temporarily detained.

849
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,620
The report from Huayan has come out.

850
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,140
It has proved that your car

851
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,340
is the one that hit Han Gang.

852
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:23,220
Okay.

853
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:25,660
I will do my best to help you with the investigation.

854
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:49,920

這 愧 是 非 心 被 良 善 責 問
