00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,960
Not long ago, six Poison Group

3
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,240
discovered someone using an oil field

4
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,280
According to the new, on June 2, this year

5
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,280
According to the address on the email,

6
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,920
in the defendant's house,

7
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,600
he found a bag with about one kilogram of cocaine.

8
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,040
So he arrested the suspect Wang Yue,

9
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,600
which is the defendant on the court.

10
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,600
The控方 decided to sue the defendant for drug and drug trafficking.

11
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,200
Did you find the drugs in the defendant's house?

12
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,520
Yes, Your Honor.

13
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,880
The prosecution's report is very clear.

14
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,280
Defendant,

15
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,920
do you confess?

16
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,440
Your Honor,

17
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,760
I confess on behalf of my client.

18
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,760
No, my son is honest.

19
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,760
He won't touch drugs.

20
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,600
Your Honor,

21
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,320
my client committed a crime because he was greedy.

22
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,280
But he was the first criminal and had a light punishment.

23
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,440
So he did this stupid thing.

24
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,640
I hope the court can judge him.

25
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,280
Report.

26
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,680
Are you sure you confess?

27
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,160
Your Honor,

28
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,480
the defendant has signed the letter of confession.

29
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,800
So I can't hear the defendant

30
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,800
answer this question in person?

31
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,280
Defendant,

32
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,280
do you know how much a kilogram of cocaine is worth?

33
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,280
Three... three thousand.

34
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,400
In terms of the price,

35
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:55,400
a kilogram of cocaine is worth 800,000.

36
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,720
Your Honor,

37
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,000
as I said,

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,920
the defendant has signed the letter of confession.

39
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,120
I want to ask the witness to answer a question.

40
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,920
Officer Huang Zhao,

41
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,200
did you find the drugs in the defendant's house

42
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,600
completely?

43
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,600
Your Honor, that's right.

44
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,000
All the drugs were found in the defendant's house.

45
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,200
If these drugs were found in the defendant's house,

46
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,120
why are there sand and weeds

47
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,520
on the packaging of these drugs?

48
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,320
Defendant,

49
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm asking you some questions now.

50
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,200
Answer me after you think it through.

51
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,920
Did you sign the package that day?

52
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,920
Did your address

53
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,920
get used by someone else?

54
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,920
When the police arrested you,

55
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,920
were you at your home

56
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,920
or outside?

57
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,920
They told me...

58
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,920
It doesn't matter what they told you.

59
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,320
In court,

60
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,320
I only need to hear the truth.

61
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,720
Only the truth can help you.

62
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,720
That's right. To tell the truth...

63
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,920
I didn't sign it.

64
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,920
My cousin often sent some packages

65
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,920
to my home.

66
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,920
I was about to go to work.

67
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,920
They... they came in

68
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,920
and caught me.

69
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,920
I was at home.

70
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,920
Defendant, let me ask you again.

71
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,920
Are you sure you admitted your innocence?

72
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,920
I didn't do drugs.

73
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,920
I didn't do drugs.

74
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,920
I didn't do drugs.

75
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,920
I didn't do drugs.

76
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,800
The

77
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,920
The

78
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,920
The

79
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,920
The

80
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,920
The

81
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,920
The

82
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,920
The

83
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,920
The

84
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,920
The

85
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,920
The

86
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,920
The

87
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,920
The

88
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,920
The

89
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,920
The

90
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,920
The

91
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,920
The

92
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,920
The

93
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,920
The

94
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,920
The

95
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,920
The

96
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,920
The

97
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,920
The

98
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,920
The

99
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,920
The

100
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,920
The

101
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,920
The

102
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,920
The

103
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,920
The

104
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,920
The

105
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,920
The

106
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,920
The

107
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,920
The

108
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,920
The

109
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,920
The

110
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,920
The

111
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,920
The

112
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,920
The

113
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,920
The

114
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,920
I think there are three big doubts.

115
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,920
First,

116
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,920
the package wasn't personally taken

117
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,920
by the defendant.

118
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,920
Second,

119
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,920
the drugs weren't found

120
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,920
to find it.

121
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,440
Otherwise, there wouldn't be

122
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,880
so much weeds and mud

123
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,400
in the packaging.

124
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,040
Third,

125
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,720
the defendant didn't know

126
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,800
the value of the drugs.

127
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,320
And he didn't find any money

128
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,600
in his bank account.

129
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,000
As for why the defendant

130
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,800
admitted something

131
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,400
he had never done before,

132
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,800
it's obvious that

133
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,080
his intelligence

134
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,200
and his education

135
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,480
are all under the influence of others.

136
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,160
But the most precious thing

137
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,080
is honesty.

138
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,800
Your Honor,

139
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,400
I also filed a lawsuit

140
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,480
based on the evidence

141
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,600
and the confession of the crime.

142
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,560
Your Honor,

143
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,480
when I first received this case,

144
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,520
the order I received

145
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,840
was to plead for the defendant

146
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,160
to plead guilty.

147
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,280
The content of the lawsuit

148
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,480
is not consistent with the facts.

149
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,680
It's also based on reasonable doubts

150
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,280
and benefits.

151
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,960
The case is now in the court.

152
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,760
The defendant, Wang Yue,

153
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,760
is innocent.

154
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,360
The court is now in the court.

155
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,120
Thank you. Thank you.

156
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,600
It's okay.

157
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,960
It's okay. It's okay.

158
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,720
It's okay. It's okay, son.

159
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,200
It's okay. It's okay.

160
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,080
Thank you, Your Honor.

161
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,040
Thank you, Your Honor.

162
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,680
Officer Huang.

163
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,960
What's the matter, Your Honor?

164
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,200
How long have you been a police officer?

165
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,720
Thirteen years.

166
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,680
I want you to go back and think about

167
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,200
what you did

168
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,560
when you wore the uniform

169
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,640
and graduated.

170
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,560
Don't forget the past

171
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,200
because of time.

172
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,560
Master.

173
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,040
Guangwen.

174
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,440
You have gone too far.

175
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,920
You pursuade both parties

176
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,680
so updatedly.

177
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:01,880
Tell me,

178
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,440
how did you sign

179
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,160
this grievance?

180
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,400
How about it?

181
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,960
Don't mention it.

182
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,680
It must be because of...

183
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,080
Remember your place as a lawyer.

184
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,120
Report any evidences.

185
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,760
Excuse me, Judge Qin,

186
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,240
please stay at the office.

187
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,480
What happened to you?

188
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,800
The case is in 어떤 way

189
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,080
ofнакомination.

190
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,240
It's grain from unity.

191
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,560
No reason to blame.

192
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,720
I just found suspicious items in your office.

193
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,320
I suspect it's a bomb.

194
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,520
The bomb-dealing expert is handling it.

195
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,120
Thank you for your hard work.

196
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,600
You're not surprised at all?

197
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,280
I'm the judge.

198
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,600
I've been in prison for so many people.

199
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,600
I can't count how many people want me dead.

200
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,680
Is everything OK?

201
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,520
We'll send a проблема a 유�Check in D&D cards.

202
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,360
Doctor,

203
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,160
there's no images of Keying.

204
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,400
Is this true?

205
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,120
See?

206
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,160
Many people are scared of IV.

207
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,080
If there's no IV,

208
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:19,480
the executors will run away.

209
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,120
The murder case of Han Kuilong, a serious businessman

210
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,280
who is closely followed by society, is about to begin.

211
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,000
Han Kuilong is the founder of Han Group.

212
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,840
Twenty years ago, he participated in the reconstruction of Huyanmupeng District

213
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:33,280
and then started a business in the area of ​​management of property and gambling.

214
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,760
There was a rumor that Han Kuilong was behind the scenes

215
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:40,000
to gain illegal interests behind the legal gambling business

216
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,960
and participate in high-level, illegal protection fees and drug trafficking and other criminal activities.

217
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,120
Han Kuilong is suspected of planning a large number of serious cases

218
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,680
that attack government officials.

219
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,240
But in the end, he was acquitted for various reasons.

220
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,760
Today, he was sued again for criminal offences.

221
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,440
The case was judged by the judge, Qin Yu, who claimed to be fair and impartial.

222
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,800
On the second day of Han Kuilong's arrest,

223
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,920
the foreign prosecutor who was originally in charge of the case

224
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,320
and his wife were attacked and injured by killers.

225
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,480
So, since Judge Qin began to investigate the case of Han Kuilong,

226
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,440
he has been under the strict protection of the police

227
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,680
until today's court hearing.

228
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,320
Don't move!

229
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,040
Report to the command center. Qin Yu is safely getting off at the side door.

230
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,720
Can Han Kuilong be charged in the case?

231
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,000
Can the law and order of Haokang be protected?

232
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,800
We are looking forward to it.

233
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:17,240
Han Kuilong is now charged with serious injury and attempted murder.

234
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,920
Is there a possibility that the person who tried to kill him

235
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:24,920
unexpectedly took action against the police and detained him with recon contributions?

236
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,160
If the victory orpreť was to be won in court,

237
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,240
which side invited Han Kuilong to participate in the case?

238
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,040
How about he be appointed?

239
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,080
How about we で only отправFree world Hood?

240
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:49,320
The boss of the black society will definitely take revenge on you.

241
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,280
Don't mention Han Kuilong first.

242
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,400
He is clearly black and white. You can tell at a glance.

243
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,680
There are some people that you can't see through.

244
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,160
You don't know if they are human or ghost.

245
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:03,840
Either you are in the same boat with them, or you are being used by them.

246
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,920
These are things that you can't learn in class.

247
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,480
You still have time to regret it.

248
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,080
Why should I regret it?

249
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,000
Is it the right thing for a lawyer to do to achieve social justice?

250
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,960
Drive carefully.

251
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
The Black Society

252
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,120
Okay, thank you.

253
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:04,480
Oh, right, Teacher. I found out who competed with you for the position of the president of the court.

254
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:08,120
Whatever. Who cares?

255
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,440
It was that Judge Lu.

256
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,360
But he is really cunning.

257
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:16,840
Once, I went to the court to see him use the wrong judicial procedures to force the prosecutor to leave.

258
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,680
He even revoked the charge against the defendant.

259
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,400
Actually, I was in the election because I didn't want to compromise the culture.

260
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,440
It affected the spirit of the law.

261
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,480
The position of the president of the court has higher standards for quality.

262
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:35,720
I believe no one can compare to our most just and selfless Judge Qin Yu.

263
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,240
Drive carefully.

264
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,440
Bye, Teacher.

265
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,720
Come.

266
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,840
Drink up.

267
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,480
Dear.

268
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,680
I love you

269
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:28,200
I love you

270
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,600
You always do

271
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,760
You know

272
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:36,060
if I could tell

273
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:42,720
The love you have

274
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,560
I wanted to be alone

275
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,880
I didn't ask you.

276
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,880
I just wants to slow down a little.

277
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,880
Playing table tennis

278
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,840
is not fancy.

279
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,120
I understand.

280
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,080
If you can't afford it,

281
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,240
get changed and go back.

282
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,600
So it's fine.

283
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,600
Yi Wei, didn't you say that there's a school basketball game today?

284
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,600
You want to be in the team?

285
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,600
I don't want to go.

286
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,600
Are you hungry?

287
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,600
I'm not hungry.

288
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,600
You're all adults. Your clothes are all over the place.

289
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,600
Why are you so angry?

290
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,600
Why is there blood on your shoes?

291
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,600
You're hurt. Where?

292
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,600
It's not my shoes.

293
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,600
Whose?

294
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,600
Tell me what happened.

295
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,600
I want to see my mom.

296
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,600
So I saw you driving out of the car this morning.

297
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:20,600
You just got your driver's license and drove out.

298
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,600
Didn't we agree to get familiar with each other?

299
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,600
Why did you...

300
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,600
You hit someone. Your blood is from the injured.

301
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,600
I didn't see that motorcycle.

302
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,600
I was on the left-hand side of the slow car.

303
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,600
I was paying attention to the right-hand side.

304
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,600
I didn't expect that motorcycle to suddenly overtake me on the left.

305
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,600
You hit the motorcycle. What happened next?

306
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,600
Then I ran down the car to see.

307
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,600
What happened next?

308
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,600
I was very scared and then the school boat accelerated.

309
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,600
I asked you how you were hurt.

310
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,600
I don't know.

311
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,600
They're standing up.

312
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,600
I don't know.

313
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,600
Is he dead?

314
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,600
I don't know.

315
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,600
I'm sorry. It was an accident.

316
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,600
You hit the motorcycle while driving.

317
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,600
You didn't care and threw it on the street.

318
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,600
Then you ran away.

319
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,600
I'll take you to turn yourself in.

320
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,600
You've grown up.

321
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,600
You have to take responsibility for what you've done.

322
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,600
No.

323
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,600
Don't call the police.

324
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,600
Okay.

325
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,600
Listen to me first.

326
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,600
If you turn yourself in now,

327
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,600
you're an intern driver.

328
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,600
You have a school boat.

329
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,600
Plus, what happened to your family recently...

330
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,600
You mean my mom was killed?

331
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,600
This is a good reason.

332
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,600
Besides, you don't have a case.

333
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,600
The judge may judge you.

334
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,600
If the police come to arrest you,

335
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,600
you don't even have this chance.

336
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,600
Am I going to jail?

337
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,600
It depends on whether you hit the person or not.

338
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,600
Don't ask me this.

339
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,600
Aren't you a judge?

340
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,600
A judge is great.

341
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,600
Can a judge hit people to death?

342
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,600
Now you're running away from the truth.

343
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,600
Okay.

344
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,600
Turn yourself in.

345
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,600
Mom.

346
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,920
Remember,

347
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,680
don't talk too much later.

348
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,440
But you have to tell the truth.

349
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,160
If no one asks,

350
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,680
don't tell them.

351
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,680
Just tell them.

352
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,880
You were driving.

353
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,040
You were scared and nervous

354
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,680
when you heard the sound of a boat.

355
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,280
You couldn't breathe,

356
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,400
so you had a car accident.

357
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,600
I'll figure out

358
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,120
what to do next.

359
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,400
How long will I be driving?

360
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,600
Don't say that for now.

361
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,080
Don't be afraid, son.

362
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,160
Although you're wrong in the law,

363
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,960
you have the right to be punished.

364
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,120
I'll go in and tell them.

365
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,840
Wait for me in the car.

366
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,880
Calm down.

367
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:58,880
Don't be afraid.

368
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,720
Mr. Qi,

369
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,960
you're here for Tang Ducha again?

370
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,600
Yes.

371
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,080
He's on the second floor.

372
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,880
Wait a minute.

373
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,560
What's up?

374
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,880
Zhao Shi Tou's case

375
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,160
was reported to the police

376
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,160
at noon.

377
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,160
What's the matter?

378
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,160
I'm worried about him.

379
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,160
What's the matter?

380
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,160
He's not here.

381
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,160
He's not here.

382
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,160
He's not here.

383
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,160
He's not here.

384
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,160
He's not here.

385
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,160
He's not here.

386
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,160
He's not here.

387
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,240
Zhao Shi Tou's case

388
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,640
was confirmed by the motorcycle dealer.

389
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,440
Han Kuilong's eldest son, Han Gang,

390
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,440
was rescued.

391
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,440
I don't know if he can be rescued.

392
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,440
Close the news immediately.

393
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,440
Don't let the media know

394
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,440
the victim is Han Gang.

395
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,440
It won't be long.

396
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,440
And

397
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,440
find someone to keep an eye on Han Kuilong.

398
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,440
Someone will report to him soon.

399
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,440
Yes, madam.

400
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,160
Hello.

401
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,160
Hello, Yi Wei.

402
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,160
Drive away from the police station immediately.

403
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,160
Wait for me in the neighborhood.

404
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,160
Try not to be found.

405
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,160
Mr. Qian.

406
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,160
Are you looking for me?

407
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,160
I'll call you later.

408
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,160
I...

409
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,160
Shi Yi Wei.

410
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,160
I was going to pick him up.

411
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,160
Shi Yi Wei.

412
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,160
Shi Yi Wei.

413
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,160
Shi Yi Wei.

414
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,160
Shi Yi Wei.

415
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,160
Shi Yi Wei.

416
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,160
Shi Yi Wei.

417
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,160
Shi Yi Wei.

418
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,160
I was going to pick him up.

419
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,160
But when I came out of the house,

420
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,160
I found my car missing.

421
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,160
Your car is missing?

422
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,160
It was stolen?

423
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,160
If you are busy,

424
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,160
it's not a big deal.

425
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,160
I'll call you tomorrow.

426
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,160
Something did happen.

427
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,160
But we are handling it.

428
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,160
But you,

429
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,160
a judge was stolen a car.

430
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,160
Did something happen?

431
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,160
I think it's just a normal theft case.

432
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,160
It's not that complicated.

433
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,160
As long as it's your case,

434
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,160
I'll take care of it.

435
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,160
Go to my office.

436
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,160
Come.

437
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,160
You can't park here.

438
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,160
It's the parking lot.

439
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,160
I...

440
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,160
I just got the license.

441
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,160
Give me some time.

442
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,160
Sorry.

443
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,160
Why didn't you put the internship mark?

444
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,160
Did you drive it yourself?

445
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,160
My dad drove it.

446
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,160
He's inside.

447
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,160
I'm sorry.

448
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,160
What happened today

449
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,160
that you found the car stolen?

450
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,160
I left the house

451
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,160
around 10 a.m.

452
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,160
The car was still there.

453
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,160
But when I came back in the afternoon,

454
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,160
the car was gone.

455
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,160
Why didn't you drive the car to work today?

456
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,160
Because I found the car stolen.

457
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,160
So I didn't drive it.

458
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,160
When I came back,

459
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,160
Zhou Luo Wen sent me back.

460
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,160
It's the one you saw

461
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,160
in the court today.

462
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,160
It's him.

463
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,160
The suspect in the bomb case.

464
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,160
Several big cases today

465
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,160
made me dizzy.

466
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,160
Really?

467
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,160
What's going on?

468
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,160
Don't wait for me.

469
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,160
I'll help you move the car.

470
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,160
Tell your dad

471
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,160
to put the internship mark on the driver.

472
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,160
Otherwise, you can't drive the car.

473
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,160
Understand?

474
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,160
Traffic accident.

475
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,160
Zhao Shi ran away.

476
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,160
He left after the car accident.

477
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,160
Is it serious?

478
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,160
The one who was hit by the car

479
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,160
is Han Gang, the son of Han Kuilong.

480
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,160
Han Gang, the son of Han Kuilong.

481
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,160
Since Han Kuilong was in prison,

482
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,160
the seven-time army of the Old City Gang

483
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,160
has been moving around.

484
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,160
But he didn't expect

485
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,160
that Han Gang, the son of Han Kuilong,

486
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,160
was more ruthless than Han Kuilong.

487
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,160
So he didn't get any benefits.

488
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,160
This time,

489
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,160
Han Gang was the one who was hit.

490
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,160
Who has the most motivation behind it?

491
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,160
Everyone can see it.

492
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,160
If the two gangs

493
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,160
really start to kill each other,

494
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,160
I don't know how many people will die.

495
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,160
The victim is in a serious condition now.

496
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,160
Judge Qin,

497
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,160
maybe this case

498
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,160
will be handed over to you sooner or later.

499
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,160
You'll know it later.

500
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,160
Okay.

501
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,160
Didn't I tell you to leave the police station?

502
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,160
Why are you still here?

503
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,160
The engine suddenly went out of order.

504
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,160
Then the police said

505
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,160
I blocked the car in front of me.

506
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,160
The engine didn't react.

507
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,160
So he stopped my car here.

508
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,160
And he said

509
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,160
I didn't put on the time mark.

510
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,160
Then he took off the license plate.

511
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,160
Who is it?

512
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,160
It's Han Gang.

513
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,160
Han Gang.

514
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,160
Who is it?

515
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,160
The person who passed by you just now.

516
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,160
Zhou Si,

517
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,160
help me look at my car.

518
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,160
Something is wrong.

519
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,160
I wonder if it was yesterday

520
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,160
that he hit me.

521
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,160
Is it a car?

522
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,160
Is it a car?

523
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,160
No.

524
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,160
Aren't we going to turn ourselves in?

525
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,160
It's no use turning yourself in now.

526
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,160
The person who was hurt by you

527
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,160
is Han Kuilong's eldest son, Han Gang.

528
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,160
He was seriously injured

529
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,160
and attempted to kill.

530
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,160
I've been against Han Kuilong for twelve years.

531
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,160
If he finds out

532
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,160
that you hurt his son,

533
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,160
don't think about coming out

534
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,160
after you go in.

535
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,160
Or you'll torture me.

536
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,160
Brother Long.

537
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,160
What's up?

538
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,160
I have bad news.

539
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,160
Tell me.

540
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,160
Your eldest son, Han Gang,

541
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,160
was hit by a car

542
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,160
and is being rescued in the hospital.

543
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,160
Is he alive or dead?

544
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,160
The situation is critical.

545
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,160
We've already found the best doctor.

546
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,160
I'm asking you, is he alive or dead?

547
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,160
We'll know after the surgery.

548
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,160
Who did it?

549
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,160
We don't know for now.

550
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,160
The murderer ran away.

551
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,160
The murderer is not here.

552
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,160
The murderer is not here.

553
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,160
The murderer is not here.

554
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,160
The murderer is not here.

555
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,160
The murderer is not here.

556
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,160
Brother Long.

557
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,160
I want to see my son.

558
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,160
Brother Long.

559
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,160
I'm afraid it's a little difficult.

560
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,160
You know how to...

561
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,160
I must see my son.

562
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,160
I want to see him alive

563
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,160
and dead.

564
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,160
You can't make the decision, can you?

565
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,160
I can't make the decision.

566
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,160
Go.

567
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,160
This morning, around ten o'clock,

568
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,160
you took the bus to school.

569
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,160
But you suddenly found that

570
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,160
you had a fever.

571
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,160
So you got off the bus at the park.

572
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,160
You didn't get better after a break.

573
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,160
So you didn't go to school.

574
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,160
You went home.

575
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,160
When you got home,

576
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,160
around twelve o'clock,

577
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,160
you found that the bus was gone.

578
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,160
You thought I drove away,

579
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,160
so you didn't care.

580
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,160
Actually,

581
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:45,160
it's because the bus didn't have a year-end holiday.

582
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,160
I called the court to pick me up.

583
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,160
Until I came back in the afternoon,

584
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,160
I found the bus was gone.

585
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,160
Remember every word I said.

586
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,160
You must do it.

587
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,160
After I go out later,

588
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,160
don't contact anyone.

589
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,160
Do you understand?

590
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,160
Yes.

591
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,160
The bus is leaving.

592
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,160
The bus is leaving.

593
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,160
The bus is leaving.

594
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,160
The bus is leaving.

595
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,160
The bus is leaving.

596
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,160
The bus is leaving.

597
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,160
The bus is leaving.

598
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,160
The bus is leaving.

599
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,160
The bus is leaving.

600
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,160
The bus is leaving.

601
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,160
The bus is leaving.

602
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,160
The bus is leaving.

603
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,160
The bus is leaving.

604
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,160
The bus is leaving.

605
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,160
The bus is leaving.

606
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,160
The bus is leaving.

607
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,160
The bus is leaving.

608
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,160
The bus is leaving.

609
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,160
The bus is leaving.

610
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,160
The bus is leaving.

611
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,160
The bus is leaving.

612
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,160
The bus is leaving.

613
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,160
The bus is leaving.

614
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,160
The bus is leaving.

615
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,160
The bus is leaving.

616
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,160
The bus is leaving.

617
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,160
The bus is leaving.

618
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,160
The bus is leaving.

619
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,160
The bus is leaving.

620
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,160
Who?

621
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,880
Hello, it's me, Qin Yu.

622
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,760
I didn't expect it's you.

623
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,000
Here's the thing.

624
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:56,240
I sold a batch of silk

625
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:56,800
and I was soaked by water.

626
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,160
I've paid the money.

627
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,160
I'm afraid they'll come to me and find me a trouble.

628
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:01,800
So protect yourself.

629
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,760
You want to see me?

630
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,960
Yes, I have something to ask you for help.

631
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,960
I don't know if you can help me get rid of the car as soon as possible.

632
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,160
Get rid of it as soon as possible?

633
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,360
I understand that.

634
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,960
Since the?

635
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,360
After the?

636
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,360
Whose car is it?

637
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,760
Because there are some things I can't show you.

638
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,360
So I'm looking for your help.

639
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,360
Is that okay?

640
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,760
Okay, I'll get you out of here.

641
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,560
Okay.

642
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,360
Hello.

643
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,360
Judge Qin wants to talk to me.

644
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:44,960
It's okay.

645
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,560
Come in.

646
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,960
Qi Changrong's people are everywhere.

647
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,160
They love to talk.

648
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,760
Have you had dinner?

649
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,760
Tell A'bao to come to me.

650
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,360
I have something to ask him for help.

651
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,360
Wei often says that

652
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,360
he has a classmate who is a judge.

653
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:21,560
That year, Wei was framed by someone in the police force.

654
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:25,160
Fortunately, Judge Qin came to help him to uphold justice

655
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,760
and clear his name.

656
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:30,360
So I really appreciate your help.

657
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,360
Actually, the case that year

658
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,560
was because of lack of evidence.

659
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,360
I've said that

660
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,360
he didn't help me because we were classmates.

661
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,960
He just didn't want to

662
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:44,160
ruin his reputation as a judge.

663
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,360
How can someone say that?

664
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,760
Although Wei was still suspended by the police,

665
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,560
there were two black and white people outside.

666
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,560
It's hard to take a risk against him.

667
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,560
Anyway,

668
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,960
I'm very grateful to our family

669
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,360
for being together.

670
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:05,960
It's important for a family to be together.

671
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,360
Mom, it's time to sleep.

672
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,560
Okay, okay.

673
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,560
Let's sleep.

674
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,360
Okay, you guys talk.

675
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,360
Come on.

676
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:16,560
Okay.

677
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,560
Go to sleep.

678
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,160
Sleep early.

679
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,560
A'bao, you're here.

680
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:27,760
Take the key.

681
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:31,960
Okay.

682
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:46,960
Uncle.

683
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,560
Did your mom scold you?

684
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,760
Is the money enough recently?

685
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,360
My second and third are paying tuition fees.

686
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,960
I also want to buy milk powder.

687
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,960
The money is never enough.

688
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:02,960
Take it.

689
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,360
No need.

690
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,360
I can make money myself.

691
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,160
I've reminded you many times.

692
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,960
Don't mess with Qi Changrong's men.

693
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,160
It doesn't matter who I'm with.

694
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,360
I can make money.

695
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,360
One mistake can ruin your life.

696
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,360
If you want to make money, come to me.

697
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,960
At least I will take care of you.

698
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:21,960
What?

699
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,360
Help me take the car apart.

700
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,360
Just take it as making money.

701
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,560
That's it?

702
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,960
It's too simple.

703
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:32,760
Where's the key?

704
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,560
If you want to take it apart,

705
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,360
you don't want to cause trouble.

706
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,360
You don't want to let people know.

707
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:43,360
Take it.

708
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,360
Okay.

709
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,160
I beg you to take it apart.

710
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,160
Can you do it?

711
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,360
Can you do it?

712
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:21,760
Open it.

713
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,160
Open it.

714
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,960
You've been busy all day. Eat something.

715
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,360
Did Dad know?

716
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,760
Luo Qiang went to inform Long.

717
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,760
Eat something if you're not hungry.

718
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,960
Dad is in prison.

719
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,160
The family's voice is being managed by my brother.

720
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,960
But this happened.

721
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,360
This happened.

722
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,560
Dad must be in a headache.

723
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,360
If I were the one who got into trouble,

724
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,960
it would be easier.

725
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,560
What are you talking about?

726
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,560
You two are both Long's sons.

727
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,160
He wouldn't think of anyone getting into trouble.

728
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:21,960
Lingyi.

729
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,360
Captain.

730
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:24,960
Captain.

731
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,560
How's it going with Gangshuang?

732
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,160
He's under surgery.

733
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,960
But the situation is not optimistic.

734
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,360
What did my dad say?

735
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,360
Long said

736
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,160
he'd turn over the harbor

737
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,960
and find that guy.

738
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,160
So far,

739
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,960
the victim's identity has not been confirmed.

740
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,360
The police also refused to reveal more related information.

741
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,360
It only shows that the case is still under investigation.

742
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,560
If there's any latest news,

743
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,160
the news will continue to be reported.

744
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:01,960
Yiwei.

745
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:05,760
Dad.

746
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,760
I'll wait for you to come back.

747
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:09,760
Don't worry.

748
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,360
I've taken care of it.

749
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,360
Dad.

750
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,560
I don't want to get you into trouble.

751
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,160
I...

752
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,160
I'll take the consequences.

753
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:17,960
Go to sleep.

754
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,160
