57
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

58
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

59
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

60
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

62
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

63
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

64
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

65
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

66
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
DCCC

67
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Two masked traitors are heading for the eight-hole forest.

68
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Stop the car.

69
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Who told you to do this?

70
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
We received a call from Gao Mi last night.

71
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
This time we provided the location and the name.

72
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Are you sure it wasn't that crazy dog Qi Chang Rong

73
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
who killed people to silence us?

74
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
The dead were from the Old God Gang.

75
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I did my best for my brother and helped Tie Tou.

76
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Who did it?

77
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I must take revenge for my brother.

78
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
The police will definitely look for you.

79
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
So be it.

80
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I've taken care of everything.

81
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
What's there to be afraid of?

82
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Do you know how big of a trouble you've caused?

83
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You killed this bastard.

84
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You think you're very capable?

85
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
If it were your brother,

86
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
he would have destroyed the entire Old God Gang.

87
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
He would have destroyed the entire Old God Gang.

88
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
But the most important thing is that

89
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
your brother can walk out of the hospital

90
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
in good health.

91
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
What's most important to you is to protect your brother.

92
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Protect his life.

93
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Do you understand?

94
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Answer me!

95
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I understand.

96
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I want to go back and pee!

97
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I want to go back and pee!

98
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Qin Yu, come in.

99
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Okay.

100
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Did I do something wrong?

101
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I shouldn't have let him go out.

102
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I taught you that

103
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
to get information is to make a mistake.

104
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You can't just let him go out.

105
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Listen,

106
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
to get information is to make a mistake.

107
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It's all a strategy.

108
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
There's no violation of the process, right?

109
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Besides,

110
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
even if it's not like this,

111
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Ma Shanbao will go out on his own sooner or later.

112
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
The person who wants to kill him can kill him anyway.

113
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
But the problem is that no one knows he's been bailed out.

114
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
On the first day...

115
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Will everyone hear every word I say?

116
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Will everyone be exposed?

117
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Okay, calm down.

118
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You can say whatever you want,

119
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
but don't touch anything I touch, okay?

120
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I never thought the mole was so close to me.

121
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Every time I took a step, he was right in front of me.

122
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Are you scared?

123
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Are you scared?

124
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I saw Qi Chengrong just now.

125
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Han Kuilong killed a man on his turf.

126
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
He will definitely be reprimanded.

127
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'll send someone to keep an eye on him for 24 hours.

128
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
He's awake.

129
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Did he say anything to you?

130
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
He only told me you were taking him out.

131
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I want to hear the rest from you.

132
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'll take him back first.

133
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
We'll talk about it later.

134
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Don't go up there yet.

135
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Go up there and explain why you told me not to let Weiwei out last night.

136
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Because...

137
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
He was a little unstable last night.

138
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
We had a fight.

139
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Weiwei is still young.

140
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Why did you suddenly take her away?

141
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I have my reasons.

142
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Then explain clearly what happened.

143
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Did you hide something from me?

144
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You're hiding something from me.

145
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Yesterday, I went to the bank to save some pocket money for Weiwei.

146
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I checked the balance.

147
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I was so scared.

148
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
So you took all the money inside.

149
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
What happened?

150
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Can I have some water?

151
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Thank you.

152
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Go ahead.

153
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Recently, I found Weiwei in a tennis tournament.

154
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
The other person is a female coach of the school basketball team.

155
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
She's a few years older.

156
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
How could this happen?

157
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I'm sorry.

158
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm sorry.

159
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I'm sorry.

160
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I'm sorry.

161
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
How could this happen?

162
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
They drank at school and shocked the school.

163
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
As their parents, I attended their spiritual meeting.

164
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
With a female coach?

165
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Maybe after my wife died, she missed her mother too much.

166
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
She wanted to find someone to talk to and give her a message.

167
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Actually, I wanted to take Weiwei to the university to study for a semester.

168
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
So I took all the money out.

169
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
You really want to go with her?

170
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You quit your job and you don't even work as a judge?

171
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I will.

172
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
If you had thought like that before,

173
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
how could my daughter kill herself?

174
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I'm sorry.

175
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
How could my daughter kill herself?

176
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
You still owe me an answer.

177
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I don't have an answer. I don't know why.

178
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I only know that after my wife died,

179
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I have to be nice to Weiwei.

180
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
What kind of coach is this?

181
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
He's so ungrateful and ungrateful.

182
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I'm going to the school to complain to him.

183
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
No need. I've dealt with it.

184
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You're going to let Weiwei leave her familiar environment and friends?

185
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Okay. We'll talk about it later.

186
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
You talk to her nicely. Don't irritate her anymore.

187
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Okay. I will.

188
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Go back.

189
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Where?

190
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Home.

191
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Let's go.

192
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Dad.

193
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Can you tell me what happened?

194
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I don't know.

195
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I don't know.

196
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I don't know.

197
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I don't know.

198
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I don't know.

199
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I don't know.

200
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Let's go home first.

201
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Okay.

202
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I understand.

203
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Don't worry. I will help you.

204
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Okay. Bye.

205
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Excuse me.

206
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
How long do I have to wait for Tang Ducha to come?

207
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Madam is still busy.

208
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Do you need me to make an appointment?

209
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I will wait for him.

210
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
We're home.

211
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Can you tell me now?

212
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Have you heard of warning confession?

213
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
When you are not only a witness or a suspect,

214
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
but also a police officer,

215
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
what you say may become a success.

216
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I'm afraid that I may say something wrong

217
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
and they will find out.

218
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Did they find out?

219
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I confirmed this morning

220
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
that they didn't find out anything.

221
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I was too nervous last night.

222
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I was too nervous.

223
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I was afraid that after I was arrested,

224
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
you would be left alone.

225
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
In the end,

226
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
you were arrested too.

227
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I was afraid that I wouldn't think about it anymore.

228
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
So I wanted to escape.

229
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
But now I'm fine.

230
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Are you sure?

231
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Yes, I'm sure.

232
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Sorry.

233
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I'm sorry.

234
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
You have a message.

235
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Please answer it.

236
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Judge Ji,

237
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
A Bao can't say anything.

238
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Don't worry, it's okay.

239
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I'll answer it.

240
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Dad, let's order takeout this afternoon, okay?

241
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Okay, you order.

242
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Dad!

243
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I love you!

244
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Inspector Tang.

245
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Please sit down.

246
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
You go ahead.

247
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
What's the matter, Ms. Zhou?

248
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Ma Shanbao was shot by the police

249
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
under the protection of the police.

250
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
There are obviously spies in the police.

251
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I strongly demand that the police

252
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
immediately make an explanation for Ma Shanbao's death.

253
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
The case is under investigation.

254
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
You know he's not the real murderer.

255
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
He has evidence that he's not present.

256
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
He was pushed out and became a scapegoat.

257
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
The police arrest people to get evidence.

258
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
But he killed people.

259
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
It's best to kill people instead of letting them go.

260
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Qu Xiong was broken into pieces.

261
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
What do you want to say?

262
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I want to say that Ma Shanbao will be in danger

263
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
if he is exposed.

264
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Why do you have to expose him?

265
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Because I thought you could protect him.

266
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Except me and the inspector

267
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
knew he would go home,

268
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
you also knew that

269
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
you would drive to the city to save him.

270
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Have you ever thought about this?

271
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Providing information,

272
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
sending him abroad,

273
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
is it really to exchange information with me

274
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
or to play with my legal means?

275
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
These legal means that only experts can play

276
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
are not something that a newcomer like you can think of.

277
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Who taught you that?

278
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I'm sorry.

279
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
How long have we been together?

280
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
The kids are asleep. Don't wake them up.

281
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I don't care if you are a cop or not.

282
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I don't care if you make a lot of money.

283
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I swore when we got married

284
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
that I would be with you

285
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
for the next few years.

286
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
But what about you?

287
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Have you forgotten what you swore?

288
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I don't know it will be like this.

289
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
What if something happens to us yesterday?

290
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I didn't expect it to be like this.

291
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
From the day A Bao came to our house,

292
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
until he was caught,

293
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
it's been two weeks.

294
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
If you have thought about it,

295
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
it means you don't care about our family's life.

296
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
A Wei, I want to leave here.

297
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I want to leave you.

298
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Why?

299
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I want to take the kids away.

300
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I just want to live a peaceful life.

301
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
After A Bao's funeral,

302
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I will take the kids away

303
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
to my parents' house.

304
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Sha Sha.

305
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Is it the criminal?

306
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Come in.

307
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Ask him if he knows

308
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
that our family has been ruined by him.

309
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Sha Sha, don't do this.

310
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Just because he helped you,

311
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
you should give up your family completely

312
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
and sell your family to him.

313
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Hello.

314
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
My phone is out of battery.

315
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I just heard your message.

316
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Didn't you say you were fine?

317
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
How did it happen?

318
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
You ask me, I will ask someone.

319
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I'm sorry.

320
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I'm sorry.

321
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Is it useful?

322
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Will A Bao come back to life?

323
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
How about this?

324
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
If A Bao's family needs anything,

325
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
tell me.

326
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
See if I can help.

327
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
How dare I bother you?

328
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I'm afraid of killing people.

329
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Don't call me again.

330
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Master.

331
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Let's go.

332
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I killed Ma Shan Bao, right?

333
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I shouldn't have listened to your advice.

334
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I shouldn't have kept him out.

335
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Then he wouldn't have died.

336
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Did you forget that I told you

337
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
that you are a lawyer and not a bodyguard?

338
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
He is only 18 years old.

339
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
If you kill him,

340
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
he will be a murderer.

341
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I will kill him.

342
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I will kill him.

343
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
He is your son.

344
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Will you still say that?

345
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Lawyers should keep a distance from their clients

346
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
to be able to perform their professional skills.

347
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Now that he is dead,

348
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
this case is over.

349
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
It's not over.

350
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Ma Shan Bao is not only my client.

351
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
He is also a living person.

352
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I will make him pay.

353
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Come.

354
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I'm leaving.

355
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Get in the car.

356
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Xiao Jun.

357
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I'm sorry.

358
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I'm sorry.

359
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I'm sorry.

360
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I'm sorry.

361
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I'm sorry.

362
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I'm sorry.

363
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
You should listen to your mother.

364
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Take good care of your sister, okay?

365
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Be good.

366
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Xiao Jun.

367
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Let's go.

368
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Drive.

369
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Drive.

370
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
The shooting that happened today

371
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
may be another battle between two different gangs.

372
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
According to the committee member Huang Xiao,

373
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
the violence between the Old City Gang and the Korean gang

374
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
was getting more and more intense

375
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
after a escape case in the Zhao family two weeks ago.

376
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
According to the police,

377
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
the victim of the shooting came from the Old City area.

378
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
The 18-year-old young man, Ma Shan Bao,

379
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
and this shooting...

380
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Did we kill him?

381
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Did you hear that?

382
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
An accident happened between the gang and the gang.

383
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
An accident?

384
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
No one can stop it.

385
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
This matter has passed.

386
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Let's not discuss it anymore, okay?

387
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I'm sorry.

388
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I'm sorry.

389
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
During the investigation,

390
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
you need to do more things.

391
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
The victim of the shooting

392
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
is an 18-year-old young man, Ma Shan Bao.

393
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
He came from a single family in the Old City.

394
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
His father is also a member of the Old City Gang.

395
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
He was killed in the last shooting a few years ago.

396
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Currently, the police have not selected the murderer.

397
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Let's eat together tonight.

398
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I'm jealous this week.

399
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
It doesn't matter what we eat.

400
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Ying,

401
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
give me a bowl of chopsticks.

402
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Okay.

403
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Young Master Lin,

404
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
according to the rules of Long Yue,

405
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
we will light the candles to light the dead.

406
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
The victim will be killed.

407
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Is this arrangement okay?

408
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
No wonder you came back to eat with me.

409
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I know that every year,

410
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
you will eat vegetarian food for your deceased family.

411
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
My father can't accompany you this year.

412
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Then I'll accompany you.

413
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
He may not be satisfied with doing other things.

414
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Okay, let's eat.

415
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Dad, mom,

416
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
brother,

417
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I came to see you.

418
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I'm fine. Don't worry.

419
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
It's been twenty years.

420
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
That fire took 104 people away.

421
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
It burned 200 people.

422
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Those who survived

423
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
have their own new life.

424
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Many people forget

425
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
how wronged their loved ones died.

426
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I have only one family left.

427
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
How can I forget?

428
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Although the murderer of the fire has died,

429
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
many people have changed their lives because of this.

430
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
You too.

431
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I didn't expect that after the fire,

432
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
you would be with Han Guilong.

433
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Only he was willing to take care of me.

434
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
You're pretty good, too.

435
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
You became a police officer.

436
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
You haven't found the hooligan yet?

437
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
After his girlfriend died,

438
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
all the contacts were cut off.

439
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
We grew up together.

440
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I don't know what he's doing now.

441
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
My family is busy recently. I'm leaving.

442
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Lin Qian,

443
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
after what happened to Han Gang,

444
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
it should be a mess outside.

445
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
You should be careful when you go in and out.

446
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I'm just a little woman by Brother Long's side.

447
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I'll help him manage the Han family

448
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
and take care of his two sons.

449
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I'll help you with the painting.

450
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I won't ask about anything else.

451
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Anyway, you should be careful.

452
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I know.

453
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
13.

454
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I thought you wouldn't come today.

455
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I said I was good at painting.

456
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
But this time,

457
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I'm really lucky.

458
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
What?

459
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Did you get the answer?

460
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
People say that the God is watching.

461
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Is the God really watching?

462
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
There are hundreds of lives on your side.

463
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
They're all innocent.

464
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
On my side,

465
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
an innocent person just died.

466
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Don't talk about my side.

467
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
We police officers

468
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
have met people we can't save

469
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
and cases we can't solve.

470
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I understand the truth.

471
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
But I'm really uncomfortable.

472
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I understand.

473
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
These are all human feelings.

474
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
You're an ordinary person.

475
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
No matter how many times you've experienced it,

476
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
you'll still feel uncomfortable.

477
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Luckily, you still have me.

478
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I'll be with you, right?

479
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I think I'll be with you today.

480
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Whatever.

481
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Anyway, we're just two people together.

482
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Are you going there again today?

483
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Of course I'm going.

484
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Then you're going to let go?

485
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Why?

486
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
There's no one here.

487
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
If you don't let go, it'll get dark.

488
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
You drive your car, I'll drive mine.

489
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
See you later.

490
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Four people in front of me.

491
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Three people in front of me.

492
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
They're all down there.

493
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Can the superficial prosperity

494
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
really cover up the dirty things behind it?

495
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
You and Lin Qian

496
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
became orphans because of this fire.

497
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
You need her to help you

498
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
find the clues about this fire.

499
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
But you don't want to tell her

500
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
what you're really investigating.

501
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Lin Qian is Han Kuilong's woman after all.

502
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Her identity is very sensitive.

503
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
The investigation is always about our police.

504
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
There's no need to involve her.

505
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Speaking of investigation,

506
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
you know my boss, Huzi,

507
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
has a lot of opinions about you, right?

508
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
He doesn't have a problem with me.

509
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
He has a problem with my boss, Dajia Ma.

510
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
After all, they're in the police team at the same time.

511
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Now my boss, Dajia Ma, is the chief police officer.

512
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
And your Huzi is still a chief police officer.

513
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Huzi really doesn't like Dajia Ma

514
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
for not taking forceful measures to clear the dark.

515
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
It's not that he doesn't have it, he doesn't dare.

516
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
He doesn't dare?

517
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
The interests involved behind it are so complicated.

518
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
You rarely speak good words for him.

519
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I'm not speaking good words for him.

520
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I just want to tell you that

521
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
in our era,

522
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
being a police officer is not something you can be so naive about.

523
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
But if you can't even trust your colleagues,

524
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
then being a police officer is very sad, right?

525
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
No need to be sad.

526
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
You can always trust me.

527
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I'm sorry.

528
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Sit.

529
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,000
I can't keep you company today.

530
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Luo Qiang has already lit the candle as you said.

531
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
As soon as he's done, it's good.

532
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
When Xiao Gang gets better,

533
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
he can take care of you for me.

534
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Xiao Lie is also very good.

535
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Last night, he even came to eat with me.

536
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Xiao Lie's biggest problem is that he's not smart enough.

537
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
He doesn't care about the whole thing.

538
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
If it's Xiao Gang,

539
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I don't have to worry about it.

540
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
How is it?

541
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
How is Xiao Gang's progress?

542
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
The doctor said he's very stable.

543
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
But it depends on his own will whether he's making any progress.

544
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Han Kuilong's son

545
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
will definitely be able to stand up again.

546
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I have a friend who knows me.

547
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
I'll help you get a good discount.

548
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
How much?

549
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I think 50% is too expensive.

550
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
It's okay.

551
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
It's really pretty.

552
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
I'm going to work.

553
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I'll see you later.

554
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Bye.

555
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Bye.

556
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Bye.

557
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Bye.

558
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
What's up?

559
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
My brother's discount is almost over.

560
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
So fast?

561
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
It should be over in half an hour.

562
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Then you come over in half an hour.

563
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Okay.

564
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I'll be right back.

565
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Sorry.

566
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
It's okay.

567
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Will it hurt if my brother does this?

568
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Don't worry.

569
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I have my brother's care.

570
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
I'll be your brother.

571
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I'll be your brother.

572
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I have my brother's care.

573
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I'll be your brother.

574
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
It'll be okay.

575
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Thank you.

576
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Thank you.

577
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Excuse me.

578
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Is your coach Yu here?

579
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
The one in pink is the one.

580
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Thank you.

581
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Coach Yu, right?

582
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Yes.

583
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
My name is Shen Ning.

584
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
I'm Qin Yiwei's grandmother.

585
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
What's the matter?

586
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I heard about you and Weiwei.

587
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Are you in love?

588
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Who told you that?

589
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Coach Yu.

590
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Weiwei is only 19 years old.

591
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Although the coach is very young,

592
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
you're his teacher.

593
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Teachers and students in love.

594
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
It seems that this behavior is very inappropriate.

595
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Wait a minute.

596
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
This has never happened before.

597
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Weiwei's father said that you drank with him at school.

598
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
The teaching committee warned you.

599
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
He said it?

600
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
He knows what happened.

601
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Why did he say that?

602
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
You mean...

603
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Qin Yiwei told me that his mother died of suicide.

604
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
I saw him in pain.

605
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
He couldn't think of anything.

606
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
So I went to care for him.

607
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I don't know if it's because of this.

608
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
He put his love for his mother on me.

609
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
In fact, we adults all know this behavior

610
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
because we feel lonely.

611
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
He wants to find a friend.

612
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
And I happen to be a person who can listen to him.

613
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Is that wrong?

614
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Sorry.

615
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I'm more straightforward.

616
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Sorry to bother you.

617
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Wait.

618
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
There's one more thing.

619
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
This necklace was given to me by Qin Yiwei.

620
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
I've already refused.

621
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
But he insisted on giving it to me.

622
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
I've never been in love with Qin Yiwei.

623
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Even if I'm a judge,

624
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I shouldn't accuse him for no reason.

625
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
The violence between the old city and the Black Gang

626
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
has been increasing in number.

627
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
There's a report that the gang members

628
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
are suspected of murder.

629
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Huang Xiao, the leader of the gang,

630
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
has been interviewed by the police.

631
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Please give your opinion.

632
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
I want to call on everyone to calm down.

633
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
I also want to advise the police

634
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
to take more precautions during the investigation.

635
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
The victim of this shooting is 18-year-old man Ma Shanbao.

636
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
He's from a single family in the old city.

637
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
His father is also from the old city.

638
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
He died in a black gang murder many years ago.

639
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
The police haven't found the murderer yet.

640
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
The investigation will continue.

641
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
So far, there are no three suspects.

642
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
The police are complaining again and again.

643
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
They have evidence to sue Ma Shanbao for embezzlement.

644
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
What evidence do you have?

645
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
The police won't just reveal our case to the public.

646
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Ma Shanbao has no evidence.

647
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
You can't get any evidence.

648
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
You're a lawyer from the defense.

649
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Do you think we'll just show you our cards?

650
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
If it's evidence, you can't hide it.

651
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
You have to reveal it.

652
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
If we really have to reveal it,

653
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
you have to reveal it.

654
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
If we really have to open the trial,

655
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
we'll do it according to the procedure.

656
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
You know it.

657
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
It's because the police can't get any evidence

658
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
that Ma Shanbao became a scapegoat.

659
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
So the police have to explain it to me.

660
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Lawyer Zhou, calm down.

661
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
What you're saying is a life.

662
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
You're not calm, you're cold-blooded.

663
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
We've used our best

664
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
to investigate the murderer of Ma Shanbao.

665
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Calm down.

666
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Madam.

667
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Judge Shen is here.

668
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
He wants to see you.

669
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Take him out.

670
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Yes, madam.

671
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Lawyer Zhou, you didn't tell me

672
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
that you were going to see Ma Shanbao.

673
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Lawyer Zhou, you don't have to come here every day.

674
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Why don't you go to the class?

675
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Don't worry, I'll go.

676
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Judge Shen.

677
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
You still recognize me?

678
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
When I first graduated from the police academy,

679
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
you were the judge.

680
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
You asked me to come here.

681
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Two weeks ago, my car was stolen.

682
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
My son-in-law filed a case.

683
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Qin Yu.

684
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I believe you know him.

685
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
You were injured because you saved him.

686
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I'm a police officer.

687
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
It's my duty.

688
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
But that car was found a few hours later.

689
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I'm sorry, Judge Shen.

690
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
The case is still under investigation.

691
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
I can't reveal anything.

692
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
If you don't tell me,

693
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
the news will be exposed.

694
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Judge Shen, you want me to break the law?

695
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
You should know better than me

696
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
about this red line.

697
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
I used to be a judge.

698
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
I know some colleagues,

699
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
even some judges,

700
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
have received threats.

701
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Even the threats of life.

702
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Qin Yu is so honest and selfless.

703
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Of course he would not have.

704
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Maybe when we are talking,

705
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
he has been threatened.

706
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
There was a tragedy in our family.

707
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
I believe you should know my daughter.

708
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Judge Shen, I...

709
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,000
I mean I don't know the reason.

710
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
I don't know either.

711
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
My daughter is a pharmacist.

712
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
She doesn't know how to take medicine.

713
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
And she is healthy.

714
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Her husband and son care about her so much.

715
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
She won't be self-reflective.

716
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
She didn't even leave her will.

717
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
There's no reason.

718
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
I don't know anything.

719
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Qin Yu is my intern.

720
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
That's why they knew each other.

721
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
When Lan Lan got married,

722
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
it was her 20th birthday.

723
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
And Qin Yu is 30 years old.

724
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
I didn't agree with that.

725
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
But,

726
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
until Wei Wei was born,

727
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I knew

728
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
this was the most precious gift

729
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
my daughter left me.

730
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Judge Shen,

731
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
was Qin Yu threatened

732
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
or threatened?

733
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Is there anything to do with this case?

734
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Judge Shen,

735
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
you said

736
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
he is a judge.

737
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
These things happen often.

738
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
You are a police officer.

739
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
You should investigate.

740
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
How do you know I didn't?

741
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Do you know Wei Wei?

742
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
We met last week.

743
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
After the theft.

744
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Right?

745
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
If you were in court,

746
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I can tell you to answer that.

747
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,000
But you are a court official now.

748
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
I don't have that in me.

749
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,000
I'm just a mother who lost her daughter.

750
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:07,000
A grandmother who wants to help her grandson.

751
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Just help me.

752
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
I'm sorry.

753
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Master.

754
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Luo Wen.

755
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Come in.

756
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:42,000
The police found a sprayer for a boat at the scene of the accident.

757
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:48,000
The DNA on the sprayer is in harmony with other findings.

758
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
What harmony?

759
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I don't know. It doesn't say anything.

760
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:58,000
But the important thing is that the sprayer and other findings are not in harmony with Ma Shanbao's DNA.

761
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
This car accident has nothing to do with Ma Shanbao.

762
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Tang Xuan knew about this early on. Zhang Jian too.

763
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
But they didn't say anything.

764
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:11,000
How did you get this confidential file?

765
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
I noticed that this file was originally with Tang Xuan.

766
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Then it was with Zhang Jian.

767
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,000
So I thought this file must be related to Ma Shanbao.

768
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Later, when I was calling the police, I took a picture of it.

769
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
I took a picture of it.

770
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Why do you seem not surprised at all?

771
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
No.

772
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,000
I didn't react at once.

773
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
The police haven't found the murderer yet.

774
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
If we don't get rid of him, we will expand the search range.

775
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,000
The victim of this shooting case is 18-year-old young man, Ma Shanbao.

776
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
He came from a single-parent family in Jiucheng.

777
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
His father is also from Jiucheng.

778
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,000
He died in a black gang murder many years ago.

779
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
The police haven't found the murderer yet.

780
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
If we don't get rid of him, we will expand the search range.

781
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,000
But so far, there is no related person.

782
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
I killed him.

783
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:45,000
First, the witness of the crime is requested by Ma Shanbao.

784
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:50,000
The condition you are talking about is that he provided the information.

785
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,000
The控方 also agreed to send him abroad.

786
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
But now Ma Shanbao is dead.

787
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,000
And he was killed while you were in residence.

788
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:06,000
The police have no responsibility in this regard.

789
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Is it really my fault?

790
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
No, no, no.

791
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,000
You have already fought for your client's best conditions.

792
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
But sometimes you have to talk about luck.

793
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,000
If the timing is not right, whatever you do is wrong.

794
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
It's not your fault.

795
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Ma Shanbao

796
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,000
The blood of the young master is the most important.

797
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
It has broken his nerves.

798
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,000
It has caused him to have problems with hearing and language.

799
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,000
But we will do our best to help him recover as soon as possible.

800
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Ma Shanbao

801
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,000
This is the hospital. How can you smoke here?

802
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
If you want to smoke, go outside.

803
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Go outside.

804
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Go outside.

805
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Go outside.

806
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Ma Shanbao

807
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Ma Shanbao

808
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Ma Shanbao

809
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Doctor, is there anything wrong?

810
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Ma Shanbao

811
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Gang

812
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Gang

813
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
What's wrong?

814
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Gang is awake.

815
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Ma Shanbao

816
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Gang

817
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Gang

818
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Gang

819
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Gang
