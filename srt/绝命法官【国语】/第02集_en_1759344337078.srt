1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,520
In the past few years, the violence between the various black social groups

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,240
plus the police last year, including the police and the procurator,

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,320
and many public officials have been attacked

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,160
has led to the loss of Haogang, which is known as the East Mondica

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,560
Nine months ago, after the black-social background businessman Han Guilong was sentenced to death

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,200
Haogang seems to have recovered its peaceful and stable

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,800
But since this morning

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,880
The black-social group that belongs to Han Guilong

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,480
There have been multiple collective fighting incidents between the old and the new

10
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,280
I believe the most popular question is

11
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,320
When will Haogang be able to gain peace forever?

12
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,280
Police! Run!

13
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,480
Don't move!

14
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,520
Stop!

15
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,480
Kneel down, Wu Qi!

16
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,280
Don't run!

17
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,080
Kneel down!

18
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,280
Hurry up!

19
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:08,880
Don't run!

20
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,080
Kneel down!

21
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,280
Don't run!

22
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,480
Kneel down!

23
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,680
Stop!

24
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,880
Stop!

25
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,480
Stop!

26
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,680
Stop!

27
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,280
Stop!

28
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,880
Stop!

29
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,480
Stop!

30
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,080
Stop!

31
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,680
Stop!

32
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,280
Stop!

33
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,280
Stop!

34
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,280
Stop!

35
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,280
Go!

36
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,280
Hurry up!

37
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,280
Episode 18

38
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,320
I'm going to the police station later.

39
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,560
Why?

40
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,280
Someone found our car.

41
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,120
They found it?

42
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,040
Where did you drive it?

43
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:46,800
Anyway,

44
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,960
our car is missing.

45
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,760
We called the police and they found it.

46
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,880
We're going to the police station to get the car back.

47
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,560
This is a normal procedure.

48
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,720
Don't worry.

49
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,480
They found the car

50
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,040
and they knew it was mine.

51
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,800
They only found the car.

52
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,560
They didn't say the car hit someone.

53
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,320
I'll take you to school after breakfast.

54
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,360
Just like usual.

55
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,080
Don't be afraid.

56
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,760
You go on eating.

57
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,040
I'll be back soon.

58
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,200
Go.

59
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,280
Oh no.

60
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,640
The police have taken the car.

61
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:41,760
I know.

62
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,240
Jing Shu informed me.

63
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,520
Why did they look for you?

64
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,760
That car is yours?

65
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,640
How could they take my car?

66
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,080
The guy who drove the car for us last night

67
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,000
is Ma Shanbao.

68
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,400
He's my cousin's son.

69
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,400
The police found his mother this morning.

70
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,480
Why did the police take my car?

71
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,240
Why did you take the car?

72
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,000
Why is it a car?

73
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:07,920
Wei,

74
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,600
don't keep asking me questions.

75
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,320
I'll help you.

76
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,840
There must be something wrong with the car.

77
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:12,960
Tell me first.

78
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,680
Why did they take my car?

79
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,040
I don't know if Baochuan is unlucky or taking the wrong path.

80
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,400
He happened to meet Qi Changlong

81
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,240
and Han Kuilun's men in Ju Zudong.

82
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,160
His car

83
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,440
was blocked by the police.

84
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,400
They blocked the right way.

85
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,400
Now the police

86
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,880
want to sue him for stealing the car

87
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,240
and driving without evidence.

88
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:33,880
Then,

89
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,040
what do you think we should do now?

90
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,840
What else can we do?

91
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,040
Let's keep him here.

92
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,040
Does he have anything to do with Qi Changlong?

93
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,640
Did he commit a crime?

94
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,880
Those who live in the old city

95
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,720
will have something to do with Qi Changlong.

96
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,560
Baochuan is a little muddled,

97
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,880
but he won't do anything that will cause trouble.

98
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,800
He is a good boy.

99
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,160
We must find a way to protect him.

100
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,720
I'll help him find a lawyer.

101
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,200
Shouldn't you

102
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,240
seek legal aid in this situation?

103
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,920
Lawyer Zhou Luo Wen

104
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,120
used to be my student.

105
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,040
What can he do for me?

106
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,760
How much does the lawyer charge?

107
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,280
Hello, Lawyer Zhou Luo Wen.

108
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,920
Hello, Luo Wen.

109
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,560
Master,

110
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,800
you want me to be a driver?

111
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,800
I'm free now.

112
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,000
I have nothing to do at the firm.

113
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:33,960
No.

114
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,400
I want to introduce you a client.

115
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:36,880
Really?

116
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,400
Yes.

117
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,640
The car theft case

118
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,360
that happened last night

119
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,480
will be contacted by Mr. Cao.

120
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,680
Mr. Cao?

121
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,800
Yes, Cao Wei Er.

122
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,400
I gave him your phone number.

123
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,120
Master,

124
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,960
I'm sorry.

125
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,760
I'm sorry.

126
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,800
Master,

127
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,960
this is my first time taking on a case.

128
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,200
If I encounter any problems,

129
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,200
will you help me?

130
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,560
Okay.

131
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,240
Of course.

132
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,120
If you have any problems,

133
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:03,960
feel free to contact me.

134
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,800
Goodbye, Master.

135
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,400
Okay.

136
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,240
Call him again.

137
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,840
Also,

138
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,120
you must inform your nephew

139
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,680
not to say anything

140
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,880
before the lawyer comes.

141
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,320
You know these things?

142
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:21,920
I know.

143
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,240
I'll leave now.

144
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:24,840
Okay.

145
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,400
Mr. Qin,

146
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,440
are you going to court directly?

147
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,680
I'll send my son back to school.

148
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,440
Then I'll go to the police station in the eastern district.

149
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,520
It's my duty to serve my idol.

150
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,480
Be careful.

151
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,800
I know.

152
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,280
A car accident

153
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,920
happened yesterday.

154
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,120
We should be careful

155
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,320
when we're on the road.

156
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,520
We'll report to you.

157
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,840
The police investigation of Zhao Shi's escape case

158
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,600
has been said to have been a breakthrough.

159
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,760
But there are still

160
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,880
related news reports.

161
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,760
The injured still haven't been released.

162
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,000
Zhao Shi's escape case?

163
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,640
I don't know who

164
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,200
could do such a cruel thing.

165
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,880
Aren't you afraid of being punished?

166
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,560
Stop the car.

167
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,080
Dad,

168
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,040
there's a bus stop here.

169
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,000
I want to take the bus.

170
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,080
Please stop the car.

171
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:19,840
Okay.

172
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,120
Mr. Qin,

173
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,080
please come to the office.

174
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,840
It's difficult to approach you like this.

175
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,760
Still,

176
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,640
I'll just take another bus.

177
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,360
And take the bus to the station in the morning.

178
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,240
Are you going to go to the police station,

179
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,640
have the Japanese sağ satisfied you?

180
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:39,880
No.

181
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,200
We don't want him to meet by chance

182
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,640
or be in the way of your rescue.

183
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,640
Right.

184
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:49,200
I'm going to talk to the police

185
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,120
andição to arrests you.

186
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,120
Mr. Qin,

187
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,400
are common cases of domestic crime.

188
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,720
I guess you're concerned about

189
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,560
the cases of Han Gangzhao and Tao Yi.

190
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,040
What do you think of

191
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,040
the investigation of the intelligence department, the chief inspector and Shi?

192
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,840
Han Kuilong is in jail now.

193
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,800
Qi Changrong must want to take this opportunity to take the throne.

194
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,840
But Han Kuilong has been in power for so many years.

195
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,400
It's not easy for Qi Changrong to take him down.

196
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,760
And it will be troublesome.

197
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,280
There are two things the chief inspector is concerned about.

198
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,280
It's stability.

199
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,080
It's simple.

200
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,120
Give Han Kuilong some time to think about it.

201
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,960
Let him go out and see his son.

202
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,440
Let him calm down.

203
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,160
Right?

204
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,920
We'll talk about the rest later.

205
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,480
As for the public opinion, it's just a small matter.

206
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,000
Think of it as a food waste for the warehouse.

207
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,200
But Han Gangzhao and Tao Yi

208
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,520
really need to keep up.

209
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,320
But Han Gangzhao and Tao Yi

210
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,520
really need to keep up.

211
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,720
Chief inspector.

212
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,480
Two gangs of black robbers were killed last night.

213
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,480
They were also involved in a criminal case.

214
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,240
As for whether they have a special relationship with Han Gangzhao,

215
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,240
we're still investigating.

216
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,680
No need to investigate.

217
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,680
Just release them.

218
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,080
Release them?

219
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:15,920
Last night we found that...

220
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,080
This is an order.

221
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,920
I don't understand Chinese.

222
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,440
When you go out, close the door gently.

223
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:26,840
Does it smell good?

224
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,160
It smells good.

225
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,560
The entrance is very soft.

226
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,400
What's wrong?

227
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,960
It's really good to have a lot of people waiting.

228
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,440
Judge Qin, you're so lucky.

229
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,960
If you had reported ten cars in the East District,

230
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,480
you wouldn't have found any.

231
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,120
You found this one overnight.

232
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,880
Look.

233
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,320
When we found the car,

234
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,680
the headlights and the door were damaged.

235
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,960
If there's no damage before the report,

236
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,080
you have to write it down.

237
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,280
There wasn't before the report.

238
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,920
Then you sign it.

239
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,800
Okay.

240
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,720
It's just a routine.

241
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,440
We found that young man

242
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,800
who drove without a driver's license.

243
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,120
It's good that he didn't crash your car.

244
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,440
Can I take the car back?

245
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,400
Yes.

246
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,440
Do you have a car key?

247
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,200
Do you need a tow truck?

248
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,640
Yes.

249
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,000
Thank you.

250
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,800
Judge Qin.

251
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,320
The one who competes with you

252
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,920
is Judge Lu Weide, right?

253
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,800
I think so.

254
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,000
If you need any help,

255
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,920
just tell me.

256
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,920
We don't want to be

257
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,160
beaten up by a mouse.

258
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,240
I'll try my best.

259
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,640
But I'm still a capable person.

260
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,520
Thank you. Bye.

261
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,000
Judge Qin, your car.

262
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,200
After you take the car back,

263
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,440
remember to take the car key.

264
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,840
And the headlights.

265
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,720
It's the safest.

266
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,360
Thank you.

267
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,560
Bye.

268
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,400
What's wrong with you?

269
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,480
Relax.

270
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,680
Follow my rhythm.

271
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,440
Thank you.

272
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,200
Here.

273
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,760
Are you feeling better?

274
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,400
Why didn't you come to the competition yesterday?

275
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,400
Let's go.

276
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:36,680
Let's go.

277
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,560
By the way, coach.

278
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,560
I forgot to bring my notes.

279
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:47,880
I'll leave first.

280
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,280
Brother Long, you can guess

281
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,480
how chaotic it is

282
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,520
here, right?

283
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,120
You don't need to move your body

284
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,120
in a single move, right?

285
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,920
Have a cup of coffee first.

286
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,520
Brother Long.

287
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,960
Give me some time.

288
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,080
If you need it,

289
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,160
I'll let you take a few days off

290
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,000
to visit your son.

291
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,720
Let your men go home and have a rest.

292
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,920
You don't need to be so aggressive.

293
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,560
You're not sure about anything.

294
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,880
It's a waste.

295
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,280
Here.

296
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,080
Here.

297
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:42,960
Mr. Hu.

298
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,840
What did the superior order?

299
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,560
To release the people who caught them yesterday,

300
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,760
whether it's Qi Changrong

301
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,200
or Han Kuilong.

302
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,680
All of them.

303
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,360
What?

304
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,160
Three cars of people were caught and brought back.

305
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,520
They hurt and destroyed people.

306
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,240
They even broke a few

307
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,520
new drugstores.

308
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,600
You want me to release them now?

309
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,280
Have you seen me drinking coffee?

310
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,640
Mr. Hu, stop making me a fool.

311
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,080
It's decided by the person who drinks coffee.

312
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,880
They said it's a good thing.

313
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,160
They don't want to make trouble.

314
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,680
Sorry, Shi.

315
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,600
Our coffee in the Eastern Region

316
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,080
is not as good as the one in the headquarters.

317
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,000
You're so happy talking to Da-Si.

318
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,880
Why are you here?

319
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,440
Han Kuilong's son is a human.

320
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,560
The one who died in his hands is not a human.

321
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,760
You sympathize with him

322
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,840
and make a deal with him.

323
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,640
According to what you said,

324
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,080
Han Kang deserves it more.

325
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,400
Will you let him go?

326
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,440
I'll let him go.

327
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,360
I'll let him go.

328
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,200
I'll let him go.

329
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,040
The murderer who hit him

330
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,120
I know you're angry.

331
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,600
But we've made a deal.

332
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,120
We can't hurt our feelings

333
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,200
because of public affairs, right?

334
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,360
But back to the point,

335
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,080
if your Central Security Team

336
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,280
needs our intelligence department's help,

337
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,160
I don't mind

338
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,960
sharing my personal feelings with you.

339
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,880
Then I want to ask you,

340
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,400
are you being unbiased

341
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,640
or being unbiased?

342
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,760
What I mean is

343
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,960
it's not easy to handle Tang Dongcha.

344
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,160
Tang Dongcha

345
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,480
See you at the usual place.

346
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,680
Judge Qin,

347
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,920
there's half an hour left.

348
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,160
And I want to say

349
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,680
Judge Shen is here.

350
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,520
I've retired.

351
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,760
I'm no longer a judge.

352
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,000
I'm here as

353
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,720
Judge Qin's mother-in-law.

354
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,960
Why didn't you inform me in advance

355
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,000
and come here yourself?

356
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,200
It's my fault.

357
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,560
Should I come back tomorrow?

358
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,560
It's fine.

359
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,640
I'll leave first.

360
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,200
Sit down.

361
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:53,960
What's up?

362
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,200
Someone stole the car.

363
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,400
Why didn't you tell me?

364
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,080
Someone stole the car.

365
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,640
But they found it now.

366
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,680
I don't want to alert you.

367
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,360
The car was registered under my name.

368
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,160
I only found out

369
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:08,840
when the transportation agency informed me.

370
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,800
Sorry.

371
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,720
I didn't think of anything

372
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,960
until after the trial.

373
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,200
Don't forget that

374
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,520
Lanlan died.

375
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,920
You haven't given me an explanation.

376
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,320
Before I start the hearing,

377
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,120
let's not discuss this issue, okay?

378
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,720
I'm just worried about Weiwei.

379
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,200
You're so busy with work.

380
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,800
The car was stolen.

381
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,040
Who dares to steal a judge's car?

382
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,360
Weiwei is fine.

383
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,480
The car was found.

384
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,080
I'm really in a hurry.

385
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,200
Let's make an appointment again.

386
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,400
Madam.

387
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,760
I can't ask anything.

388
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,160
That guy refused to tell me.

389
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,360
He's from the old city.

390
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,960
He stole a car.

391
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,280
He's suspected of being in Qi Changrong's house.

392
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,760
I don't understand.

393
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,360
There are so many cars on the street.

394
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,240
Why would he steal a judge's car?

395
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,240
Go on.

396
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,800
His lawyer is here.

397
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,080
He's been waiting for hours.

398
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,840
Let him wait.

399
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,080
Is it his right to see a lawyer?

400
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,360
Let him see.

401
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:30,920
Okay.

402
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,800
Madam.

403
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,120
We found something on the scene.

404
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,840
The witness group found

405
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,600
the oil and gas marks on the car.

406
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,520
I think they left them

407
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,920
when two cars collided.

408
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,960
Can they find

409
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,520
what car they found through these oil and gas marks?

410
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,000
We can only tell if it's an European car

411
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,280
or a Japanese car.

412
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,640
Through the car head lights and fragments found on the scene,

413
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,080
the witness group said it could be a Japanese car.

414
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:54,920
But we need to find

415
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,120
the car that collided with the motorcycle

416
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,240
to verify it.

417
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,880
Then we can confirm it.

418
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,600
You said it was a Japanese car.

419
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,720
And there are traces of collision.

420
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,160
And there are fragments of the car head lights on the scene.

421
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,040
Yes, madam.

422
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,560
There's a police officer at the school.

423
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,880
I... I ran away.

424
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,440
Hello.

425
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,040
Yes.

426
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,640
I'm the student's parent.

427
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,920
I saw a police officer

428
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,640
in the school.

429
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,840
I don't know what happened.

430
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,600
I called the police.

431
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,040
Okay. Thank you.

432
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,280
Come in.

433
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:54,800
Judge Qin.

434
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,800
Tang Ducha is here.

435
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,240
Tang Ducha. What's up?

436
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,560
Judge Qin.

437
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,520
Tang Ducha.

438
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,400
What's up?

439
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,240
Judge Qin.

440
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,520
Where's your car?

441
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,680
The doctor said

442
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,200
Tang Ducha is stable for the time being.

443
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,800
But he's in a serious condition.

444
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,160
The most important thing is

445
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,920
whether he can wake up.

446
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,200
My son Han Kuilong

447
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,680
won't die so easily.

448
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,960
He'll get better.

449
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,360
You're the strongest on earth

450
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,440
when you save him.

451
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,240
The unpaid page of labeled credit

452
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,720
will always be expensive in the bank.

453
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,160
I cut it off

454
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,000
for my brother Nhu's health.

455
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,040
My brother just died.

456
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,640
Mr. Bai,

457
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,160
I don't think

458
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,480
brother is an accident.

459
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,960
I'll be your brother in the future.

460
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,080
You don't know much.

461
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,760
After he wakes up,

462
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,240
he'll know what to do.

463
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,280
Boss,

464
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,240
I don't want to meddle in anything.

465
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,080
I just want to tell you

466
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,560
that he's not only your son,

467
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,080
but also my brother.

468
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,160
He's also my brother.

469
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,640
I went to the scene and checked.

470
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,720
It's possible that he was left by the man who hurt my brother.

471
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:41,880
Okay.

472
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:43,960
Give it to Lin Yi.

473
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,800
He knows what to do.

474
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,200
Give it to the police.

475
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,360
Let them do what they should do.

476
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,640
I don't believe them.

477
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,720
Do what I tell you to do.

478
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,760
Do you know why

479
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,000
I don't let you meddle in?

480
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,120
It's to be on the safe side.

481
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,320
I have two sons.

482
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,120
I have to keep a way out.

483
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,200
Do you really think

484
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,800
the judge of Qin

485
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,040
can punish me

486
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,400
and put me in jail?

487
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,920
There are many things

488
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,600
that are not as simple as you think.

489
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,480
The headlight is broken.

490
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,560
But the scratches haven't been repaired.

491
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:42,800
Yes.

492
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,200
Because these scratches

493
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,720
need to be repaired in the garage.

494
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,040
I don't think it will affect driving.

495
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,920
I plan to repair it during the holiday.

496
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,280
Where is it repaired?

497
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,400
I don't know which garage.

498
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,600
Because it was arranged by the driver of the court.

499
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,160
Hello.

500
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,640
Go to the garage designated by the court.

501
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,520
There was a box of champagne in their garage.

502
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,440
Change the headlight in their garage.

503
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,640
Bring all the parts and fragments

504
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,640
back to me.

505
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,440
Okay.

506
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,160
Is there something

507
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,280
I need to know?

508
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,520
Judge Qin.

509
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,160
We suspect that

510
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,160
the car that hit Han Gang

511
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,800
is the one you reported to the police.

512
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,640
Did the suspect confess?

513
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,240
No.

514
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,240
He didn't say anything.

515
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,320
But we have enough evidence to show

516
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,760
that it's very likely.

517
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,360
So we need to detain your car

518
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,520
and let the witness department handle it.

519
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:44,920
Get evidence,

520
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:45,920
draw a picture and check it.

521
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,120
Including the scratches on the car,

522
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,280
the fragments on the head of the car,

523
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,480
and the oil stains.

524
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,720
Please sign here

525
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,960
and give me the car keys.

526
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,760
I'll notify you

527
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,800
when the witness department is done.

528
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,280
How long will it take?

529
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,120
Don't worry.

530
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,160
I'll tell them

531
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,240
and make them hurry up.

532
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,480
Judge Qin.

533
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,600
Tang Ducha.

534
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,520
Why are you two together again?

535
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,960
Which idiot is so unlucky this time?

536
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,960
Judge Qin is the light of justice

537
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,160
in our court.

538
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,640
Now we have the support of the police.

539
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,840
And we have a high reputation.

540
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,720
Your reputation

541
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,840
is really high,

542
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,120
Mr. Yuan.

543
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,320
Mr. Lu, you're overpraising me.

544
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,160
I won't bother you anymore.

545
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,000
Let's just get married.

546
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,080
Judge Qin.

547
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,120
I have to trouble you with one more thing.

548
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,160
You can tell me who hit you.

549
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,360
I can tell him.

550
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,560
Did they threaten you

551
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,480
and want to accuse you?

552
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,480
If you don't tell me,

553
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,320
they might hit harder next time.

554
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,560
As long as you stand up bravely,

555
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:07,960
I can tell them

556
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,160
that they used violence too much.

557
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,120
No need.

558
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,520
I'll tell him.

559
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,760
I'll tell him.

560
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:14,960
I'll tell him.

561
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,720
I'll tell him.

562
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,480
I'll tell him.

563
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,320
I'll tell him.

564
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,760
I don't want to cause any trouble.

565
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,680
You still have other troubles?

566
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,920
Do you want me

567
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,120
to be investigated officially?

568
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,520
If so,

569
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,040
you might need some legal documents.

570
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,200
Not to be investigated,

571
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,520
but to assist in the investigation.

572
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,640
Go back with us to identify the suspect.

573
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,120
It's 10 o'clock in the morning.

574
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,880
Han Kuilong and Qi Changrong's men

575
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,600
fought hard to grab the land.

576
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,840
More than ten were injured.

577
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,640
Three were injured.

578
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,640
These are common cases for them.

579
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,680
If Han Kuilong knows

580
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,520
Qi Changrong's men

581
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,600
hurt his son,

582
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,360
I don't know how many people will die.

583
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,520
What can you do?

584
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,880
I can catch the real murderer

585
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,560
who hit Han Gang as soon as possible.

586
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,760
I can punish him

587
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,280
and give him an explanation.

588
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,680
This is the best way

589
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,560
to calm down this storm.

590
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:12,680
Otherwise,

591
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,760
this matter will only get worse.

592
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,240
I know you used to have

593
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,360
a case of stealing cars

594
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,600
and stealing things.

595
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,560
But you were not an adult,

596
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,520
so you were sentenced to death.

597
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,920
It's all in the past.

598
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,760
You are 18 years old now.

599
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,640
They will sue you for being an adult.

600
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,240
Maybe I can use other ways

601
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,280
to plead for you.

602
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:39,960
For example,

603
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,760
your family's situation.

604
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,880
I met your mother before I came here.

605
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,320
She was worried about you.

606
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,960
She kept asking me

607
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,840
when I could go home.

608
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,080
Your mother said

609
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,280
you can't be alone in the family.

610
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,480
Three younger brothers and sisters

611
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,360
left me again.

612
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,400
You are the only one in the family.

613
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,520
I can't live without you.

614
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,080
You could not be here.

615
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,720
I need you to tell me

616
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,920
that I need to know everything

617
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,760
before you were taken by the police.

618
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,560
So I can help you.

619
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,920
Your duty is to protect your rights and interests.

620
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,760
You must remember.

621
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,920
When you take any interrogation,

622
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,720
you must ask for a lawyer.

623
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,040
And I

624
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,240
am your lawyer.

625
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,680
Understand?

626
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:11,880
Judge Qin.

627
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,120
If you need me to go through the process

628
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,480
and make an official application

629
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,920
or help with the investigation,

630
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,160
I can do it.

631
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,720
Between you and me,

632
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,640
do we have to do this?

633
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,080
The sooner we solve this case,

634
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,280
the less innocent people will be hurt.

635
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,320
Judge Qin.

636
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,120
Please, okay?

637
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:33,840
Okay.

638
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,120
Mr. Tang.

639
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,520
I hope my name and my identity

640
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,360
are not exposed.

641
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:48,680
Besides,

642
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,120
although the owner of the car is my mother-in-law,

643
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,120
you can come to me directly.

644
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,120
After all, she is a retired judge.

645
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,520
I don't want to disturb her.

646
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,120
I understand.

647
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:58,880
Judge Qin.

648
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,920
I know that this case

649
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,040
involves Han Kuilong.

650
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,120
You will be a little nervous.

651
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,600
But I promise you

652
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,440
that all the information is absolutely confidential.

653
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,640
You can help identify the criminal later.

654
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,320
Okay.

655
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,240
Are we going to the witness room now?

656
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:12,880
Of course.

657
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,880
The criminal can't see you in that room.

658
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:15,520
Don't worry.

659
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,400
Let's go.

660
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,240
Bastard!

661
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:29,960
Mo Hua.

662
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,520
You framed me.

663
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,680
I didn't steal the car.

664
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,520
You framed me.

665
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,720
I didn't steal the car.

666
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,080
Bastard, I didn't.

667
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:36,640
Mr. Tang.

668
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,800
I didn't.

669
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,280
I didn't.

670
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,760
I didn't.

671
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,160
Police Chief.

672
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,560
It's the police chief.

673
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,040
Let me go.

674
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,120
Let me go.

675
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:47,880
Let go.

676
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,600
Sir Mellon.

677
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,440
It's Judge Qin.

678
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:58,920
Take him away.

679
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,760
I'm so sorry, Judge Qin.

680
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,640
I didn't scare you, right?

681
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,000
No.

682
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,520
That criminal seems to know you.

683
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:12,840
Do you remember

684
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,280
what situation he was in

685
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,640
and if you remember him?

686
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,920
I remember that day.

687
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,520
I left home at about ten o'clock.

688
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,520
He seemed to have appeared

689
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,520
across my house.

690
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:26,960
Okay.

691
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,480
I'm really sorry.

692
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,000
I'll take you home.

693
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,120
Here.

694
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,720
Weiwei.

695
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,600
Weiwei.

696
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,440
Recently,

697
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,480
someone stole the car at home.

698
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,120
Do you know what happened?

699
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,440
Did my dad tell you?

700
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,120
Of course, he wouldn't tell me anything.

701
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,400
But Uncle Yun saw that the car

702
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,840
was registered under my name.

703
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:55,920
So he informed me

704
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,200
that the car had been found.

705
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,600
Your district

706
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,400
has always been safe.

707
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,480
Why would someone steal the car?

708
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,280
Weiwei.

709
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,720
If you have any problem,

710
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,840
you should tell me.

711
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,000
Do you know?

712
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,920
Don't be like your mom.

713
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,120
Grandma, stop talking.

714
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,640
I'm leaving.

715
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:21,760
Weiwei.

716
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,680
Why is that boy

717
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,840
so hurt on his face?

718
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,440
He went to the police.

719
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,120
He just stole the car.

720
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,960
Do we need to arrest him?

721
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,080
Judge Qin.

722
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,040
He's not an ordinary boy.

723
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,560
He's from the old district.

724
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:47,960
Last month,

725
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,280
a subordinate of mine

726
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,000
was stabbed by a man from the old district.

727
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,600
He's still in the hospital.

728
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,440
He stole the car.

729
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,240
Who can tell if he has a knife or a gun?

730
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,120
If it were you,

731
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,200
would you risk your life?

732
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,400
You can't be soft

733
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,840
when dealing with criminals.

734
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,320
I'll go with you.

735
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:13,960
Stop the car.

736
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,240
Weiwei.

737
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,160
Weiwei.

738
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,360
Don't go.

739
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,680
The police are in the car.

740
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,720
Don't run.

741
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,080
Dad.

742
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,440
The police are looking for me at school.

743
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,280
I asked them.

744
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,280
It's a case of murder.

745
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:36,960
It has nothing to do with you.

746
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,160
If they come to arrest me,

747
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,400
you won't be involved.

748
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,240
Do you think it's okay to be arrested?

749
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,640
Will Han Kuilong let you go?

750
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,640
Will he let me go?

751
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,480
You've grown up.

752
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,760
Aren't you going to call the police?

753
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,200
The police are right behind you.

754
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,000
What do you want to tell him?

755
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,840
Tell him.

756
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,840
Tell him.

757
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,840
Qian Yiwei.

758
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,440
What's wrong?

759
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,560
Why are you making your dad so angry?

760
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,160
Do you have something to say?

761
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:07,640
I'm fine.

762
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,320
You're an adult.

763
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,680
You don't know what he's thinking.

764
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,320
Young people are like that.

765
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,400
Get in the car.

766
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:37,760
Your Honor.

767
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,160
The defense believes that

768
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,320
my client Ma Shanbao

769
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,440
didn't steal the car.

770
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,200
He drove a car

771
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,880
that was not known to have been stolen.

772
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,760
So he was arrested.

773
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,400
During the interrogation,

774
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,720
there was a reason to suspect that

775
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,240
the police used violence too much.

776
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,280
So the defense

777
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,560
kept the justice of the charge.

778
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,200
Your Honor.

779
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,200
The defense lawyer

780
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,120
never questioned the police

781
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:04,880
before.

782
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,880
Now he deliberately suggests

783
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,600
that he wants to

784
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,840
confuse the focus of the discussion.

785
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,480
Your Honor.

786
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,440
The defense insists that

787
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,520
the court will take the case.

788
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,600
Please transfer my client

789
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,400
to a safe place.

790
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,120
The defense lawyer.

791
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,920
I will meet your request.

792
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,160
Because I

793
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,480
received some information

794
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,520
that is not suitable

795
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,160
to be released in court.

796
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,000
Not suitable to be released in court?

797
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:36,600
Your Honor.

798
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,640
Yes.

799
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,480
All the doubts

800
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,080
of the relevant defense

801
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,600
should be

802
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,840
investigated by the defense

803
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,640
for seven days.

804
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,480
Then we will re-examine the case.

805
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,480
Ma Shanbao

806
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,440
will still be in the police station.

807
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,440
No further interrogation is allowed.

808
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:02,720
Ma Shanbao.

809
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:07,480
Ma.

810
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,000
Are you okay?

811
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,520
I'm fine.

812
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,200
I'm fine.

813
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,120
I'm fine.

814
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:10,840
Don't worry.

815
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,080
Don't say anything.

816
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,080
You'll be fine.

817
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,640
Why did you keep him for seven days?

818
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,720
Didn't you say he would be home soon?

819
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,480
Miss Chen.

820
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,360
Give me some time.

821
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,320
Please trust me.

822
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,840
הס 你 得 很 快

823
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:58,600
Madam.

824
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,200
Mr. Qin is calling for court report.

825
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,680
Why didn't you just leave it to the Chinese case?

826
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,280
I don't trust them.

827
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,440
Then I can trust you.

828
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,520
I believe you.

829
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:05,960
Hello?

830
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:06,800
Mr. Qian.

831
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,600
Sorry to bother you again.

832
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,200
Please go ahead.

833
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,480
I want to inform you

834
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,680
that your car needs to be temporarily seized.

835
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,560
The report from Huayan has come out.

836
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,080
It has proved that your car

837
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,280
is the one that hit Han Gang.

838
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,280
Okay.

839
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,600
I will do my best to help you with the investigation.
