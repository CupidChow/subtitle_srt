00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,060
Hello

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,940
Any trace here?

5
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:23,660
No

00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Master

9
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I come here for the first time

10
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I didn't expect you come at this time

11
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I won't bother you

12
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
No

13
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm sorry

14
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Sit down

15
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's spacious here

16
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I asked you about it when I moved here

17
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You said it's a good area

18
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I guess you have forgotten it

19
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I just passed by here

20
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I came to see you

21
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I promised to help you

22
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
How is the car theft case handled?

23
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Ma Shanbao's case

24
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
My client is called Ma Shanbao

25
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
By the way

26
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Who is that Cao Wei'er?

27
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
How are you related to him?

28
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
He used to be a police officer

29
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So we cooperated

30
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I don't know if it's because of him

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I always feel that Ma Shanbao is not cooperating

32
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
He said he would hire a lawyer

33
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Why didn't he cooperate?

34
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Maybe I'm too sensitive

35
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Did Ma Shanbao tell you anything?

36
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I have told him that I am his lawyer

37
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm here to help him

38
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
But he refused to say anything

39
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Did he tell the police anything?

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Same as the police

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
He refused to say anything

42
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Maybe he is from the old city

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
People there don't like police

44
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
This is common

45
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Who is his main judge?

46
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
The one who competed with you

47
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Lu Wei De

48
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Luo Wen

49
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Actually I haven't told you one more thing

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
The police have officially informed me

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
The car I was stolen

52
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Is the one Ma Shanbao stole

53
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's yours

54
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You helped the suspect to find a lawyer

55
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Why did you do that?

56
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Sorry, I can only say this

57
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You have to tell me later

58
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I only found out later

59
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
That suspect is his nephew

60
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
But I have called the police

61
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
And I want to help that young man

62
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
So I have to find you

63
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Luo Wen

64
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
We have the same goal

65
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
We all want to help that young man

66
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Ma Shanbao is really poor

67
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I won't give up

68
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Ok

69
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Ok

70
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You are here

71
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Why don't you go in?

72
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Weiwei didn't go to school today

73
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Do you know?

74
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
She has grown up

75
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Let her arrange her time

76
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I think she has a problem with her mood

77
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I want to take her to see psychological training

78
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
She just didn't go to school for a day

79
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It doesn't have to be so serious

80
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You just don't care about her

81
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You don't know what she needs

82
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I come back every night

83
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I have no problem communicating with her

84
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
If there is anything I need

85
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
She can tell me anytime

86
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You are like this

87
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
They don't tell you

88
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You think it's ok

89
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Lanlan is like this

90
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Weiwei is like this

91
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
She is like this

92
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
When something happens

93
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's not good to be so serious

94
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Don't forget

95
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You haven't told me about her death

96
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
What should I tell you?

97
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
What should you tell me?

98
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
She is your daughter

99
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And she is my wife

100
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I want to know more than you

101
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
What happened

102
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Nine months

103
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I accept it

104
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
But everything has an answer

105
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Whether you accept it or not

106
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You are a bad boy

107
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
You are a bad boy

108
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I like you

109
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Three guns and 300 bullets

110
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
The police found them when they were searching the defendant's house

111
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And the police report said

112
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
The weapons were found in the warehouse next to the defendant's house

113
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Not in the house

114
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Because the warehouse is not locked

115
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So the control party must prove that the weapons

116
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Are from the defendant

117
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Not from others

118
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So the control party must prove that the weapons

119
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Are from the defendant

120
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Not from others

121
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
The weapons are from the defendant

122
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Not from others

123
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
And it's obvious

124
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
The control party didn't list the other possibilities as reasonable

125
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
And they intended to mislead the department

126
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Now the department requires the control party to re-examine all evidence

127
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
The lawsuit must be in line with the facts and justice

128
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Two principles

129
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Judge Qin

130
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
We are familiar with each other

131
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
But I have a question

132
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Can you explain why this thing appeared in your car

133
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Is it from the police

134
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Yes, it's from the government

135
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
The witness found it in your car

136
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Then you should ask your colleagues

137
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
If they left it behind

138
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
This piece of paper

139
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Doesn't belong to the witness

140
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It should be from a book

141
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
The record of the police

142
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
But on the day of the search

143
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
The police were not there

144
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
My car was missing for 24 hours

145
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
During this period

146
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Who could have touched my car

147
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I think you should check your own people first

148
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
What do you mean

149
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Half a year ago

150
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
A police chief colluded with the gang

151
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I was afraid he would be in jail for three years

152
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And he is not the only one

153
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Who was convicted by me

154
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
What do you want to suggest

155
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I want to know

156
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
What do you want to know

157
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
The police who was convicted by me

158
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
What do you want to suggest

159
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Do you remember the explosion

160
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Why someone could

161
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Put a bomb item in my office

162
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
This is enough to prove

163
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
There are some people

164
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Who don't believe me

165
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Do you understand

166
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Are you familiar with it

167
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Isn't this my handwriting

168
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I wrote it in my notebook

169
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I spent two whole days

170
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
To compare all the handwriting

171
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I found you

172
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Can you give me a reasonable explanation

173
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
That day I was in the police station

174
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I forgot to put it there

175
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You don't know any government official

176
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Do you want to report

177
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Madam, where did you find it

178
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
In a car

179
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Or a snake

180
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
After hitting people

181
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
The car that was stolen

182
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I need an explanation

183
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Why this paper

184
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Will appear on that car

185
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Why are you asking me

186
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Are you interrogating me

187
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Is it because I am from the old city

188
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You know Qi Changrong

189
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
People from the old city

190
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Are they related to Qi Changrong

191
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Do you know Ma Shanbao

192
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
A thief

193
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
He is also from the old city

194
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
In your eyes

195
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
People from the old city are thieves

196
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You haven't answered my question

197
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I don't know

198
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I ask you again

199
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Madam, I am a police

200
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Not a thief

201
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
A thief

202
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Must be related to Qi Changrong

203
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
The person who was hit

204
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Is the son of Han Kunlong, Han Gang

205
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
You

206
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Stop the job

207
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
We will conduct an internal investigation on you at any time

208
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Please sign

209
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Thank you, Mr. Qin

210
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Please

211
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Yiwei

212
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
We won't open that one

213
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Come here

214
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Come out and have a walk

215
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Come

216
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
The date written on it

217
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Is Zhuang Sun's birthday

218
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
When he was away from Japan

219
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Then Qin Faguan

220
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Come to report the truth

221
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Then Qin Faguan

222
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Come to report the car

223
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Then Han Gang was hit by a car

224
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
All the same day

225
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Don't forget

226
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
We also arrested a lot of Han Kunlong

227
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
And Qi Changrong's subordinates

228
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And Ma Shanbao

229
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I think the strangest thing is

230
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It's not something valuable to do in Japan

231
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Who would steal

232
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
There is one last possibility

233
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Although I still have some savings

234
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
But I can't rule out this possibility

235
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It's our own people

236
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
To take revenge

237
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
And frame Qin Faguan

238
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
It seems to be too twisted

239
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It seems to have nothing to do with Qin Faguan

240
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
And no evidence

241
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Yes

242
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
If it's our own people

243
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
How can they be so stupid

244
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You mean Madam is stupid

245
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Go to do your work

246
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Shut up

247
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Fatman

248
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
What should I do

249
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
President Wang

250
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Isn't the revenue about twice as positive as the fire?

251
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I think the factory may have a little more job

252
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:40,840
The hairdgoverning

253
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Don't you please

254
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,200
You should be stronger.

255
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,800
I want to be strong, too.

256
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,240
Actually,

257
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,360
things are not as bad as you think.

258
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,760
We should continue to live a normal life.

259
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,560
I will continue to work.

260
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,880
You can continue to go to school.

261
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,480
Melon.

262
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,760
What about Hiang Chen?

263
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,720
He just got told to come here for work.

264
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,680
All right.

265
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,520
My lawyer might not be here.

266
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,640
You can't interrogate me.

267
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,400
We were just chatting.

268
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,040
You don't have to be so anxious.

269
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,200
One side is the thief who has a case.

270
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,480
He said he didn't steal.

271
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,000
The other side is a high-ranking judge.

272
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,200
He said he saw the thief at the scene of the accident.

273
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,720
Which side do you think is more pitiful?

274
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,520
It's so hard to say that he stole.

275
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,320
Don't play dumb.

276
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,800
Guohua, calm down.

277
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,600
Sorry, madam.

278
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,200
If you didn't steal,

279
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,600
why did you drive that car?

280
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,400
Continue asking.

281
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,000
Yes, madam.

282
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,800
I did all the application procedures.

283
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,000
Give me a reason.

284
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Why can't I see my client?

285
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,800
It's my right to see a lawyer.

286
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,800
I won't leave until I see him today.

287
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,200
Please be quiet. This is the police station.

288
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,400
What's your police number?

289
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,600
I'm going to sue you.

290
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,600
2795 Tang Xuan.

291
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,400
Use my police number.

292
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,800
Madam.

293
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,000
You didn't tell them

294
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,400
that our security system is being repaired.

295
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,400
Are you going to rearrange all the meetings?

296
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:11,000
I told her that she had to stay here.

297
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,200
You can't question my client

298
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,400
without a lawyer.

299
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,200
What evidence do you have to prove

300
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,600
that I'm questioning her?

301
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:39,000
I'm not as patient as madam.

302
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,800
Let me ask you again.

303
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,600
How did you get the scratch on the car?

304
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,000
How did you get the scratch on the car?

305
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,600
Tell me!

306
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,000
You really have guts.

307
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,600
You're from the old city, right?

308
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,600
You ran into Han Gang.

309
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,400
He's Han Kuilong's son.

310
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,800
Aren't you afraid?

311
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,200
We'll let you go now.

312
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,800
You're going to die.

313
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,800
Are you going to tell me?

314
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,200
I'll take care of everything here.

315
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,000
I'll write down

316
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,600
Ma Shanbao struggled

317
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,200
and broke a water cup.

318
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,400
Then he accidentally

319
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,600
put the glass into his eyes.

320
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,600
Then it's over.

321
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,200
I'll tell you the truth.

322
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,800
I'll tell you the truth.

323
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,400
I'll tell you the truth.

324
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,800
I'll tell you the truth.

325
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,200
I'll tell you the truth.

326
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,800
I'll tell you the truth.

327
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,200
I'll tell you the truth.

328
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,800
Are you going to tell me?

329
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,800
I don't have time today.

330
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
It won't be like this next time.

331
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,400
Did you hear me?

332
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,400
Come here.

333
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,000
We have something to talk about here.

334
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,000
They won't let me see Ma Shanbao.

335
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,000
You're a lawyer.

336
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Shouldn't you be the one to solve it?

337
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,800
I'm here to tell you

338
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,800
that Ma Shanbao was beaten at the detention center.

339
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,600
And it's not the first time.

340
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,400
When he was in court last time,

341
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,400
you saw the wound on his face.

342
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,400
You try to protect him.

343
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,600
He won't be beaten.

344
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,200
As his uncle,

345
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,400
if you really care about him,

346
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,000
you should call him mother.

347
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,800
You stood up as a supervisor

348
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,200
and complained to the court

349
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,400
that the police used violence too much.

350
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,400
Who is the lawyer now?

351
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,600
I have to do everything myself.

352
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,200
Why should I hire you?

353
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,200
I've done my duty.

354
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,800
But Ma Shanbao refused to cooperate.

355
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,800
I want to know

356
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,200
who told him not to say anything.

357
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,400
If you know anything,

358
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,600
you must tell me.

359
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,000
Ma Shanbao is only 18 years old

360
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,200
and he's still a young man.

361
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,800
He's in such a miserable situation.

362
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,800
As his family, don't you feel sorry for him?

363
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,000
I beg you to help him as much as you can.

364
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:22,900
Sanxin Hospital

365
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,200
Wei,

366
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,600
Did you know that summer camp was interacts with Ah Bao?

367
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,200
You should know that

368
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,200
you are the policeman and

369
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,000
you know these things often happen.

370
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,200
Maybe he

371
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,400
is in trouble.

372
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,000
You also know that

373
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,400
the police are very sensitive with bigger people.

374
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,120
The police don't like the old city.

375
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,360
Do they like the police?

376
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:52,840
Wei.

377
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,960
You must remind A'bao.

378
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,320
He must keep his mouth shut.

379
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,840
Let the lawyer handle everything.

380
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,440
A'bao will never talk nonsense.

381
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,280
He dares to be a traitor in front of the police.

382
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,480
He will be ashamed to see anyone in his life.

383
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,200
Why did you take the car apart?

384
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,360
Can you stop asking me this question?

385
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,520
Why can't I ask?

386
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,440
Although I was suspended,

387
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,440
I still have the bottom line.

388
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,400
Are you hiding something from me?

389
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,880
Either you explain it to me clearly

390
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,280
or you explain it to the police yourself.

391
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,120
Yes.

392
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,160
I was wrong this time.

393
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,160
I was really wrong.

394
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,600
Stop hiding it.

395
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,080
Second intervention.

396
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,680
Alas.

397
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,760
I suddenly have to bring it paraffin here.

398
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,480
Is it how you plan to Museum and Tezhu。」

399
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:56,840
Yes.

400
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,200
You know

401
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:06,880
Xiwanglling road has a traffic jam lately.

402
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,640
What did the police report say?

403
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
There was no report.

404
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,160
The police didn't report anything.

405
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,440
I can't be the only one who can't be the candidate.

406
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,440
My professional skills will also be questioned.

407
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,440
So I told you to disassemble the car.

408
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,440
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

409
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:33,440
I don't want to tell you because I don't want things to be too complicated.

410
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,440
But now, it's all because of A'bao.

411
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,440
I feel guilty.

412
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,440
You think,

413
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,440
how should we handle this?

414
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,440
The most painful thing right now is your female apprentice.

415
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,440
What's wrong with her?

416
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,440
She's very smart.

417
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,440
She guessed that someone wouldn't let A'bao talk.

418
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,440
She's already starting to suspect me.

419
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,440
I really don't know how long A'bao can hold on.

420
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:06,440
I'm worried that she'll be killed by someone sooner or later.

421
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,440
Then,

422
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,440
should we give her family some money?

423
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,440
How much do you need?

424
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,440
She's already dead.

425
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,440
What's the use of asking for money?

426
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,440
Your lawyer apprentice

427
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,440
only knows how to pursue a cause and not how to save people.

428
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
Things are getting more and more complicated because of her.

429
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,440
What's wrong?

430
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,440
What did you order today?

431
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,440
We're already home. Why are you still ordering food?

432
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,440
Didn't you see that grandma's car is outside?

433
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,440
At home, you should eat fresh and nutritious food.

434
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,440
Weiwei, go up and do your homework.

435
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,440
You still need to stew the beef for a while before you can eat it.

436
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,440
I'm going to the bathroom.

437
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,440
I'll be right back.

438
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,440
I'll be right back.

439
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,440
I'll be right back.

440
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,440
I'll be right back.

441
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,440
I'll be right back.

442
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,440
I'll be right back.

443
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,440
Weiwei is fine.

444
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,440
I'm worried about you.

445
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,440
Look.

446
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,440
Your car was stolen for a while.

447
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,440
You said you found it later.

448
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,440
Now you're being questioned by the police.

449
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,440
You didn't tell me anything.

450
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,440
Weiwei even said you changed a new car, right?

451
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,440
No, because that old car was going to be used for tea.

452
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,440
After the inspection, it would take a lot of money to repair.

453
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,440
So I bought a new car.

454
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,440
It's nothing.

455
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,440
This photo was sent to the magazine anonymously.

456
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,440
My friend at the magazine knew that this car was mine.

457
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,440
That's why it wasn't released.

458
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,440
I'm a judge.

459
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,440
I've been mentally prepared for these malicious attacks.

460
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,440
You're prepared, but Weiwei isn't.

461
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,440
You're not just a judge.

462
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,440
You're also Weiwei's father.

463
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,440
You know I'm her father.

464
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,440
Don't interfere in our father and son affairs.

465
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,440
He's also my grandson.

466
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,440
If you do your father's duty well,

467
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,440
you care about him, take care of him, and accompany him often.

468
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,440
Why should I be so worried?

469
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,440
I don't care about him.

470
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,440
I don't need to report to you if I take care of him.

471
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,440
What does he eat every day?

472
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,440
You don't care.

473
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,440
You don't know he didn't go to school.

474
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,440
I don't know.

475
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,440
After his mother died, he lost so much weight.

476
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,440
You still can't tell.

477
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,440
Do you care about your son like this?

478
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,440
He's 19 years old.

479
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,440
He's a college student.

480
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,440
He's afraid of being taken care of by his children.

481
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,440
He goes to his school.

482
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,440
I go to my class.

483
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,440
It's normal.

484
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,440
You are indeed a very talented judge.

485
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,440
That's why I married you.

486
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,440
But that doesn't mean all your decisions are right.

487
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,440
For example, you want to be elected to the court.

488
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,440
Do you know that if you are elected,

489
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,440
you don't have any private time?

490
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,440
You spend every day in the court.

491
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,440
When you get home, you have to look at the file and write a lawyer's word.

492
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,440
You don't even have time to eat takeout with your son.

493
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,440
I'm an old woman.

494
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,440
No one knows better than me.

495
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:13,440
It's not easy to be a good judge and a good father.

496
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,440
You're no longer a judge.

497
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,440
This is not a court.

498
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,440
It doesn't mean I can't do it.

499
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,440
Sorry.

500
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,440
You're a good man.

501
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,440
Just call Weiwei to eat.

502
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,440
I'm sorry.

503
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,440
I'm sorry.

504
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,440
I'm sorry.

505
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,440
I'm sorry.

506
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,440
I'm sorry.

507
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,440
I'm sorry.

508
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,440
I'm sorry.

509
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,440
I'm sorry.

510
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,440
I'm sorry.

511
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,440
I'm sorry.

512
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,440
I'm sorry.

513
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,440
I'm sorry.

514
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,440
I'm sorry.

515
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,440
I'm sorry.

516
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,440
I'm sorry.

517
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,440
I'm sorry.

518
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,440
I'm sorry.

519
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,440
I'm sorry.

520
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,440
I'm sorry.

521
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,440
I'm sorry.

522
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,440
I'm sorry.

523
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,440
I'm sorry.

524
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,440
I'm sorry.

525
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,440
I'm sorry.

526
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,440
I'm sorry.

527
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,440
I'm sorry.

528
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,440
I'm sorry.

529
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,440
I'm sorry.

530
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,440
I'm sorry.

531
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,440
I'm sorry.

532
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,440
I'm sorry.

533
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,440
I'm sorry.

534
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,440
I'm sorry.

535
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,440
I'm sorry.

536
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,440
I'm sorry.

537
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,440
I'm sorry.

538
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,440
I'm sorry.

539
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,440
I'm sorry.

540
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,440
I'm sorry.

541
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,440
I'm sorry.

542
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,440
I'm sorry.

543
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,440
I'm sorry.

544
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,440
I'm sorry.

545
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,440
I'm sorry.

546
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,440
I'm sorry.

547
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,440
I'm sorry.

548
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,440
I'm sorry.

549
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,440
I'm sorry.

550
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,440
I'm sorry.

551
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,440
I'm sorry.

552
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,440
I'm sorry.

553
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,440
I'm sorry.

554
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,440
I'm sorry.

555
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,440
I'm sorry.

556
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,440
I'm sorry.

557
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,440
I'm sorry.

558
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,440
I'm sorry.

559
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,480
Listen.

560
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,440
What happened?

561
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,940
My mother's mom

562
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:56,440
knew Oftentimes hit by a car

563
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,440
isn't the right time

564
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,440
to make the call.

565
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,440
She is suffering from severe fever.

566
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,440
A heart attack could inches

567
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,440
difficulty in walking.

568
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,440
I shouldn't fight with your grandma.

569
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,440
I know she died for us.

570
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,440
Your different mother is absent.

571
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,440
She could solve anything.

572
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,440
And even if I want to get angry.

573
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,280
I'm sorry.

574
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,560
Are you mad at your mother?

575
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,880
I'm a little angry.

576
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,680
I really don't understand

577
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,760
why she left us like this.

578
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,680
This family

579
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,080
is so scattered.

580
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,160
Mom, she...

581
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,360
We'll go to watch a movie later

582
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,880
and buy a new pair of shoes.

583
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,600
Next time.

584
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,080
I'm going to school.

585
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,160
Judge Qin.

586
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,480
What's the matter?

587
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,120
We didn't send any photos.

588
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,520
The police and I

589
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,640
have cooperated.

590
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,280
I've said

591
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,400
it wasn't us.

592
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:27,640
Besides,

593
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,840
why would I do that?

594
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,120
Why would I offend

595
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,400
a judge who's been working with me for years?

596
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,440
Who do you think is the suspect?

597
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
What's wrong with these two cars?

598
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,800
I'm sorry, Judge Lu.

599
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,760
I didn't mean to hurt you.

600
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,760
I'm sorry, Judge Lu.

601
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,720
I can't tell you.

602
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,560
Is that car

603
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Judge Qin's?

604
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,840
Please cooperate with our work.

605
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,080
Judge Lu Weide.

606
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,120
The one who competed with you

607
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,160
for the president of the court.

608
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,680
What's the reason?

609
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,240
He passed by the scene

610
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,720
on the day of the search.

611
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,440
He recognized your car

612
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,840
and wandered around

613
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,440
with his assistant in the parking lot.

614
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,520
He really did it.

615
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,600
He appeared at the scene.

616
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,640
Plus, he had a motive.

617
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,440
Sorry.

618
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,440
It's normal to suspect

619
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,400
and look for the truth.

620
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:26,720
But

621
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,760
I just told you

622
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,640
what I saw.

623
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,440
But if you tell others

624
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,720
that I told you,

625
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:33,720
sorry,

626
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,720
I'll deny it.

627
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:35,880
Okay.

628
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,440
I can catch the mole of the police station.

629
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,160
But the mouse in the court

630
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:41,880
has nothing to do with me.

631
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,000
Okay.

632
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,520
Okay.

633
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,080
Jin Yiwei.

634
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,560
Is there a competition today after school?

635
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:58,880
That's it.

636
00:30:59,040 --> 00:30:59,560
I'll wait for you.

637
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,120
Do you know that Cao Wei'er

638
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:07,960
dismissed me?

639
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,160
Really?

640
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,240
I think he's guilty

641
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,080
that he dismissed me.

642
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:12,360
Okay.

643
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,240
Let's talk inside.

644
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,060
Theyêmesanism

645
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,260
P Missouri

646
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,480

647
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,260
Copyright

648
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,760
The movie was public

649
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:21,220
You champion

650
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,480
Opponent

651
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,600
I'm in the US

652
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,240
Music

653
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,800
Wanya

654
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,080
End of discussion

655
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,180
Vers lawn

656
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,660
Exhilarations

657
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,980
Fifteen thousand dollars

658
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:41,440
White

659
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,720
Ex 있었

660
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,720
I'm sorry.

661
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,800
Actually, you don't have to care about it.

662
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,320
Because you will meet

663
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,240
many strange customers in the future.

664
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,720
Cao Wei Er is not another customer.

665
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,320
He is your friend.

666
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:10,840
Ma Shan Bao and your son are almost the same age.

667
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:11,880
Think about it.

668
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,440
If your son was beaten up today,

669
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,440
what would you do?

670
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,880
The first rule of being a lawyer

671
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,480
is not to be emotional with your client.

672
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,560
I'm not your student anymore.

673
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,440
You don't need to teach me like this.

674
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,360
Okay.

675
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,960
What I said is the truth.

676
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,480
Now your sympathy

677
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,440
is affecting your judgment.

678
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,320
Remember,

679
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,400
you are a lawyer, not a social worker.

680
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,240
You can't sue him

681
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,880
because the client replaced you.

682
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,280
You don't need to doubt Cao Wei Er

683
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,440
whether he wants to save Ma Shan Bao.

684
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,920
It's you who wants to save Ma Shan Bao.

685
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,120
Or you can't

686
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,800
save Ma Shan Bao as a lawyer.

687
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,480
I can't answer

688
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,680
other things.

689
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,480
What else can I help you?

690
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,880
The End

691
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:26,840
Bye, coach.

692
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,560
Bye. See you tomorrow.

693
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,560
Bye.

694
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,600
What are you doing?

695
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,680
Nothing. You can go now.

696
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,560
Bye.

697
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,760
See you tomorrow. Bye.

698
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,760
Bye, coach.

699
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,480
Qin Yi Wei.

700
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,680
You're drinking at school.

701
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,560
Give it to me.

702
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,960
Leave me alone.

703
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,480
You'll be expelled

704
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,120
if you're found out by the school.

705
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:51,920
Give it to me.

706
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,480
Leave me alone.

707
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,320
My mom is dead.

708
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,680
I know why she left us.

709
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,560
You don't have to pity me.

710
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Stop drinking. Give it to me.

711
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:12,880
Tapi

712
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,660
I love you.

713
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:33,700
Don't do silly things anymore.

714
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,680
Did something happen at home?

715
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,280
is not the solution.

716
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,800
I know.

717
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,680
I know it can't be solved.

718
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:52,640
Relax.

719
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:53,920
Calm down.

720
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,560
Follow me.

721
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:04,640
You're back.

722
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,040
Time is just right.

723
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,120
The night is just right.

724
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,880
I seriously suspect

725
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,680
you installed a tracker in my phone.

726
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,440
Why did you come up at this time?

727
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,800
I'm from the intelligence department.

728
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,680
I don't have such a detective ability.

729
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,800
Jiajia's scarf is left here.

730
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,440
Will she come back in two days?

731
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,920
You must have taken it to her.

732
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,840
She applied for a long time

733
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,680
before she was transferred to the Eastern District Hospital.

734
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,560
She called me this morning.

735
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,120
She should be home soon.

736
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,360
So I can't keep

737
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,280
you and Tang Ducha, right?

738
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,920
I only have her sister.

739
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,960
I thought you only liked coffee.

740
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,280
You also liked vinegar.

741
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,480
I thought Tang Ducha only liked work.

742
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,720
So you liked to dig up the bones of the stone.

743
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,480
Okay.

744
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,040
I can't keep you.

745
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,800
With this,

746
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,640
I can keep you.

747
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:11,680
What's this?

748
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,080
I found it at the crime scene in Han Gang.

749
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,040
Who gave it to you?

750
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,120
There are some blood stains on it.

751
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,320
You should investigate it.

752
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,320
You should find something.

753
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,640
Who gave it to you?

754
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,280
Do you want to eat this bowl of noodles or not?

755
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,640
I cooked it very hard.

756
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,000
Don't waste it if you don't eat it.

757
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:35,840
Well.

758
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,520
Anyway,

759
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,200
the person who gave me this

760
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,360
is the same as your target.

761
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,640
They all want to find the real murderer.

762
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,200
There is no conspiracy at all.

763
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,840
There is no conflict of interest at all.

764
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,440
Okay?

765
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,080
Jiajia.

766
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,040
I'm sorry.

767
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,720
I have something important

768
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,960
to deal with tonight.

769
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,520
Okay.

770
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,000
See you later.

771
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:06,720
Okay.

772
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:07,800
Get up.

773
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,040
The car is here, Qin Youwei.

774
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:09,680
Get up.

775
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:11,960
Hello, Judge Qin.

776
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,520
I'm the basketball coach, Yu Xin.

777
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,840
I just called you.

778
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,000
Why are you so drunk?

779
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,600
It has nothing to do with the coach.

780
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,040
I said I wanted to drink.

781
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,120
Get in the car first.

782
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:21,680
Come on.

783
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,480
Be careful.

784
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,720
Judge Qin, you may have to pay attention.

785
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,880
He just had a miscarriage.

786
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,680
I'll pay you later.

787
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,280
Okay.

788
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:34,880
Thank you.

789
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,760
You know you have a miscarriage.

790
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,160
Don't drink anymore.

791
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,360
It will stimulate the organ.

792
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:54,880
Yuwei.

793
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,840
I'm listening.

794
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:00,760
After you drank,

795
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,920
did you tell the coach anything?

796
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,800
What did I say?

797
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,160
You shouldn't say it.

798
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,000
I didn't tell him anything.

799
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,240
Nothing.

800
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,520
Didn't you bring the spray gun?

801
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,440
Are you listening to me?

802
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,080
I don't need to answer.

803
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,120
I'm a decent coach.

804
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,480
There are better offers.

805
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,160
Do you agree

806
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:53,880
the

807
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,520
accepting tamanho

808
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,280
and USD payment

809
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,680
in the books?

810
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,800
Someone found a new evidence

811
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,000
at the scene of the car accident.

812
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,880
They will be sent to do blood and DNA test.

813
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:05,960
Once the result is out,

814
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,960
the real murderer will be caught

815
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,880
and punished.

816
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:25,960
Yi Wei,

817
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,320
you don't have to find it.

818
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:08,260
Xia Zhuo Belarus

819
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:10,480
I know

820
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,400
who is the person who hurt Han Gang.

821
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:22,560
Police

822
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:35,760
《Why is it because》

823
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,760
Because, why is it because

824
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:46,760
Like the burning flame, each one is possible

825
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:52,760
Pass, as if to chase

826
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:57,760
Heart, hate in the heart

827
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,760
Like burning can burn it

828
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:08,760
Love and hate, organisms cannot be together

829
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,760
Blood, when the heart is dark

830
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:18,760
L project, do the light and darkness

831
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,560
Blue oh blue sky, that's why

832
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,760
Let關係 squeeze

833
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:57,760
But look at the heart in pain

834
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:07,760
Looking at the peaceful people, but I am rational

835
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,760
Push to the side of the heart, stubbornness is the main thing

836
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:13,760
Why is it impossible to be silent

837
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,760
I can't kill the road back

838
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,760
The future is more difficult

839
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,760
The road is long, good people are right

840
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,760
But look at the heart in pain
