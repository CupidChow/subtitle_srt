EPISODE 11

3
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:21,701
Haesoo,

4
00:00:23,411 --> 00:00:24,704
what happened to you?

5
00:00:26,164 --> 00:00:28,958
Dojin tried to have me killed.

6
00:00:30,626 --> 00:00:31,627
What?

7
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:33,713
Please help me, Jaehyun.

8
00:01:01,908 --> 00:01:03,993
Yes, Kyojin. You ready?

9
00:01:04,076 --> 00:01:05,995
Will you really be all right?

10
00:01:06,078 --> 00:01:08,539
I'm fine. Could you just shut
down the security system?

11
00:01:09,832 --> 00:01:10,958
One moment.

12
00:01:22,845 --> 00:01:25,306
<i>If Sungchan has my flash drive,</i>

13
00:01:25,389 --> 00:01:27,391
<i>he'll need it for the
second presentation.</i>

14
00:01:29,227 --> 00:01:32,146
<i>Because the key to activating
the human smart patch software</i>

15
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:33,773
<i>is that flash drive.</i>

16
00:01:54,752 --> 00:01:56,128
You.

17
00:01:56,212 --> 00:01:58,172
Once this presentation is over,

18
00:01:58,256 --> 00:01:59,423
Hatch…

19
00:02:00,549 --> 00:02:01,550
is all yours.

20
00:02:02,677 --> 00:02:04,053
Oh, geez.

21
00:02:04,637 --> 00:02:06,639
You've waited so long for this.

22
00:02:07,515 --> 00:02:10,518
Well done.
You son of a bitch!

23
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,646
Goodness.

24
00:02:48,347 --> 00:02:50,349
<i>Have you found Sujeong?</i>

25
00:02:57,231 --> 00:02:58,733
Oh, shit.

26
00:03:05,948 --> 00:03:06,949
Kyojin.

27
00:03:11,037 --> 00:03:12,997
Been a while, Sungchan.

28
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,415
You've been well?

29
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,208
Yes, of course.

30
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:19,211
And you? Are you well?

31
00:03:20,129 --> 00:03:23,674
<i>How can I be well after
spending seven years in a coma?</i>

32
00:03:23,758 --> 00:03:25,092
Exactly.

33
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,554
You should've stayed at Hatch
until you fully recovered.

34
00:03:28,637 --> 00:03:31,140
I was surprised
to find you gone.

35
00:03:31,223 --> 00:03:32,850
You didn't even say goodbye.

36
00:03:33,517 --> 00:03:35,603
<i>I never knew you cared about me
so much.</i>

37
00:03:36,354 --> 00:03:40,316
It's pretty upsetting
to hear you talk that way.

38
00:03:40,399 --> 00:03:46,906
Kyojin, we've all been so
eager to see you wake up, okay?

39
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:48,491
Is that so?

40
00:03:51,952 --> 00:03:53,079
Then what will you do

41
00:03:53,621 --> 00:03:55,706
if I tell you to hand
over Hatch to me?

42
00:03:57,458 --> 00:04:00,711
Your company was built on research
theories you stole from me.

43
00:04:01,962 --> 00:04:04,632
Theories aren't
everything, are they?

44
00:04:04,715 --> 00:04:08,886
Plus, it was us who developed and
refined the tech for seven years.

45
00:04:08,969 --> 00:04:10,638
At least give us
credit for that.

46
00:04:10,721 --> 00:04:14,433
And let's be frank, isn't it because
of us that you're able to walk again?

47
00:04:14,517 --> 00:04:15,601
Are you saying

48
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,895
I should be thanking you?

49
00:04:19,397 --> 00:04:21,982
- Yes. -<i>You were the ones
who made me like this.</i>

50
00:04:22,483 --> 00:04:26,529
That day, someone pushed
my bike off the cliff.

51
00:04:27,029 --> 00:04:29,740
Jaehyun, Dojin, or you!

52
00:04:29,824 --> 00:04:31,742
One of you three
tried to kill me!

53
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,205
Is that what happened?

54
00:04:49,218 --> 00:04:50,302
Where am I?

55
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,640
We're at the Gapyeong villa.
A hotel probably isn't ideal.

56
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:56,892
You okay?

57
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:04,525
I heard you went abroad
after the divorce.

58
00:05:05,526 --> 00:05:06,527
What happened?

59
00:05:07,862 --> 00:05:10,030
What's this about
Dojin trying to kill you?

60
00:05:14,285 --> 00:05:15,494
Jaehyun,

61
00:05:16,495 --> 00:05:17,955
Dojin's father…

62
00:05:19,165 --> 00:05:21,792
put out a hit on my
father 15 years ago.

63
00:05:24,336 --> 00:05:25,629
What are you saying?

64
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:28,132
The man who ordered the hit

65
00:05:28,883 --> 00:05:32,761
on his friend of 30 years at the
inauguration was Chairman Jang.

66
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,348
Dojin stopped me from
revealing the truth.

67
00:05:36,849 --> 00:05:39,351
He ordered Mr. Uhm
to have me killed.

68
00:05:39,435 --> 00:05:41,562
How could he do this to me?

69
00:05:41,645 --> 00:05:42,646
Wait.

70
00:05:45,941 --> 00:05:48,235
I'm not understanding
anything you're saying.

71
00:05:49,528 --> 00:05:51,614
I wish this was all a dream too.

72
00:05:53,449 --> 00:05:55,284
<i>No, take her to Incheon Port.</i>

73
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:58,120
Haesoo's suffered enough.

74
00:05:58,204 --> 00:06:00,789
It's time we lay
her down to rest

75
00:06:00,873 --> 00:06:03,751
next to her parents
she misses so badly.

76
00:06:05,753 --> 00:06:06,795
Do you…

77
00:06:07,838 --> 00:06:09,131
have any proof?

78
00:06:11,217 --> 00:06:12,343
He took everything.

79
00:06:13,135 --> 00:06:15,471
Mr. Park had been bought too.

80
00:06:15,554 --> 00:06:18,724
He had to silence me
to save his father.

81
00:06:22,603 --> 00:06:23,604
So,

82
00:06:24,688 --> 00:06:26,106
what will you do now?

83
00:06:29,318 --> 00:06:30,486
You tell me first.

84
00:06:31,403 --> 00:06:33,906
You were also betrayed
by someone you love.

85
00:06:34,406 --> 00:06:35,616
I know everything.

86
00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:38,869
I know Taera killed
my father that day.

87
00:06:41,539 --> 00:06:43,290
At first, I doubted you too.

88
00:06:43,374 --> 00:06:46,418
I thought you kept secret
the fact that she's a killer.

89
00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:49,255
But I realized
that made no sense.

90
00:06:49,922 --> 00:06:53,092
How could you run for president
if you'd known about that?

91
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:59,682
She fooled you too, didn't she?

92
00:07:00,558 --> 00:07:02,059
The fake identity of Taera,

93
00:07:02,601 --> 00:07:05,020
you knew nothing
about that, right?

94
00:07:07,273 --> 00:07:08,899
You're not in your right mind.

95
00:07:11,235 --> 00:07:13,612
You must be in shock.
You need more rest.

96
00:07:22,663 --> 00:07:25,583
Eventually, you'll
come to me for help.

97
00:07:43,642 --> 00:07:44,935
What happened with Haesoo?

98
00:07:45,019 --> 00:07:48,939
The ship's crew said the anesthesia
must've worn off before the ship embarked.

99
00:07:49,023 --> 00:07:50,566
<i>Dojin doesn't know yet.</i>

100
00:07:50,649 --> 00:07:52,735
How the hell can you
slip up like this?

101
00:07:56,905 --> 00:07:58,282
You catch Cha Pilseung?

102
00:07:58,365 --> 00:08:01,160
He was definitely at Mokeum
Temple, but he escaped.

103
00:08:01,243 --> 00:08:04,079
We're searching the surrounding areas.
-Mokeum Temple?

104
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:09,084
How can it be a coincidence

105
00:08:09,168 --> 00:08:12,630
that he was hiding
under the auspices of Ms. Min?

106
00:08:29,897 --> 00:08:31,398
What's all this mess?

107
00:08:32,566 --> 00:08:33,901
What did you do?

108
00:08:37,946 --> 00:08:40,491
- Where is Jiu?
- You won't ever see her again.

109
00:08:42,284 --> 00:08:44,828
I sent her to a place
out of your reach.

110
00:08:44,912 --> 00:08:47,873
What? You sent my daughter off
without my permission?

111
00:08:49,249 --> 00:08:50,501
Bring her back now.

112
00:08:51,335 --> 00:08:54,463
- Now!
- You have no right to be her parent.

113
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:56,298
Same goes for me.

114
00:08:57,383 --> 00:09:00,761
Pay for your sins if you want to
face Jiu with any conscience.

115
00:09:01,261 --> 00:09:03,681
- Because I plan to.
- You're going on about that again?

116
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:06,183
Isn't it all said and done?

117
00:09:06,975 --> 00:09:08,227
Where is she?

118
00:09:08,727 --> 00:09:10,312
Where's my daughter?

119
00:09:10,396 --> 00:09:11,939
Withdraw your candidacy.

120
00:09:12,022 --> 00:09:14,900
Turn yourself in,
and face the consequences first.

121
00:09:14,983 --> 00:09:17,403
This is the best
I can do for Jiu.

122
00:09:19,029 --> 00:09:22,032
Let's go to the police tomorrow.
-Taera!

123
00:09:22,908 --> 00:09:25,494
It'll all be okay
if you just stay silent, okay?

124
00:09:25,577 --> 00:09:27,413
I told you I'd take care of it.

125
00:09:28,122 --> 00:09:30,791
Why are you making
things worse? Why?

126
00:09:31,417 --> 00:09:36,213
It's me, the husband you love,
your soul mate, Pyo Jaehyun!

127
00:09:38,841 --> 00:09:40,676
Cut the bullshit!

128
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:43,971
Our family's broken, and you're
not the man I love anymore.

129
00:09:45,472 --> 00:09:47,224
It's up to you now.

130
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,895
Confess your crimes
and withdraw,

131
00:09:52,438 --> 00:09:54,982
or be forced to step
down in disgrace.

132
00:09:56,608 --> 00:09:58,235
How could you abandon me?

133
00:10:00,571 --> 00:10:02,614
The Hong Taera I created...

134
00:10:04,867 --> 00:10:05,993
How could you?

135
00:10:06,869 --> 00:10:08,704
A murderer like you

136
00:10:09,663 --> 00:10:11,665
should never become president.

137
00:10:13,792 --> 00:10:16,420
Just as I should
never be first lady.

138
00:10:24,887 --> 00:10:27,514
Dr. Choi, what's happening to
Father?

139
00:10:27,598 --> 00:10:29,308
Something must've
put him in shock.

140
00:10:29,391 --> 00:10:31,477
His condition's worsened
after the seizure.

141
00:10:33,103 --> 00:10:37,065
- Was someone here?
- Well, Ms. Min paid a brief visit.

142
00:10:37,149 --> 00:10:38,650
- Mother?
- Yes.

143
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,085
STOCK WAIVER AGREEMENT

144
00:11:00,506 --> 00:11:02,549
JANG KUMMO

145
00:11:12,935 --> 00:11:15,771
<i>Mother, did you have to go this
far?</i>

146
00:11:16,897 --> 00:11:20,067
What I did is nothing compared
to what your father has done.

147
00:11:21,026 --> 00:11:23,904
At least I spared his life.

148
00:11:23,987 --> 00:11:25,405
Didn't I warn you?

149
00:11:26,281 --> 00:11:29,117
I can't allow you to take over
Kumjo. You don't deserve it.

150
00:11:29,201 --> 00:11:31,286
Why on earth are you doing this?

151
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:32,663
Why haven't you once...

152
00:11:33,163 --> 00:11:34,998
Why can't you give me a chance?

153
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:38,126
I may be a stepson, but I've
been a son to you for 40 years.

154
00:11:40,087 --> 00:11:41,255
Do you remember?

155
00:11:42,798 --> 00:11:44,716
I think you were in
elementary school.

156
00:11:45,676 --> 00:11:48,303
Kyojin's bicycle
had broken down.

157
00:11:49,221 --> 00:11:52,724
It was a birthday gift from
Father, so it meant a lot to him.

158
00:11:54,226 --> 00:11:56,812
I know you were the
one who broke it.

159
00:11:58,438 --> 00:12:01,817
<i>You pretended as if you'd done
nothing and fooled me and Kyojin.</i>

160
00:12:02,568 --> 00:12:06,947
<i>Had you been honest then,
I would've pitied you a little.</i>

161
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:10,492
Always pretending to be ignorant,
innocent, and without ambition,

162
00:12:10,576 --> 00:12:12,119
you were such a hypocrite.

163
00:12:13,871 --> 00:12:17,791
I'm not such a great mother that
I'd put up with a man like you.

164
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:21,920
Fine.

165
00:12:22,421 --> 00:12:24,381
I agree that I haven't
been a good son.

166
00:12:26,466 --> 00:12:27,634
But Kumjo Group

167
00:12:28,635 --> 00:12:30,095
is mine for the taking.

168
00:12:30,804 --> 00:12:33,682
Tell Kyojin I'm
prepared to fight.

169
00:12:33,765 --> 00:12:34,808
Careful now.

170
00:12:35,893 --> 00:12:38,896
Lusting after what's not yours
can prove harmful.

171
00:12:47,654 --> 00:12:49,364
You have to wake up.

172
00:12:49,448 --> 00:12:50,699
Now you're…

173
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:53,869
all I have left.

174
00:13:04,046 --> 00:13:05,881
What's wrong? Something happen?

175
00:13:07,424 --> 00:13:08,800
You're right.

176
00:13:10,552 --> 00:13:12,804
I knew about Taera all along,

177
00:13:14,514 --> 00:13:16,350
but I didn't want to accept it.

178
00:13:20,771 --> 00:13:24,107
I understand why you kept silent.
It must've been a real shock.

179
00:13:24,191 --> 00:13:27,361
Even now, thinking about it
makes me tremble in fear.

180
00:13:28,862 --> 00:13:30,405
Taera wants to turn herself in.

181
00:13:31,657 --> 00:13:34,409
She wants to reveal her
identity, receive punishment…

182
00:13:35,035 --> 00:13:37,412
She hid Jiu somewhere,
and I have no idea where.

183
00:13:37,496 --> 00:13:39,081
What do you mean?

184
00:13:39,164 --> 00:13:40,958
You and Jiu have
done nothing wrong.

185
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:42,334
You know me, right?

186
00:13:42,417 --> 00:13:46,713
I lived my whole life for Taera.
I gave her only the best, but she...

187
00:13:48,882 --> 00:13:50,717
She wants to tear me down.

188
00:13:52,844 --> 00:13:54,137
It's over for me now.

189
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:58,558
It's over for us,
both Jiu's life and mine.

190
00:14:00,143 --> 00:14:02,104
I've loved Taera so much.

191
00:14:03,397 --> 00:14:05,482
She can't do this to me.

192
00:14:07,985 --> 00:14:10,821
Taera ruined my life. Don't
let her ruin anyone else's.

193
00:14:10,904 --> 00:14:13,156
I know what it took
for you to get here.

194
00:14:13,907 --> 00:14:17,077
You can't give up without a
fight. Think about it.

195
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,038
You know you're the only person
I can trust now.

196
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:30,841
Mr. Uhm, where are you?
Did you look into it?

197
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:34,428
Taera wouldn't have entrusted
Jiu to a stranger.

198
00:14:35,012 --> 00:14:37,431
Jiu must be with that
prick, Cha Pilseung.

199
00:14:38,015 --> 00:14:40,809
They might've fled abroad.
Check immigration records.

200
00:14:40,892 --> 00:14:43,145
Find Jiu as fast
as you can. Hurry!

201
00:15:00,537 --> 00:15:01,830
<i>Hagyeong.</i>

202
00:15:01,913 --> 00:15:03,707
Hajun, have you arrived safely?

203
00:15:04,332 --> 00:15:05,500
Where's Jiu?

204
00:15:05,584 --> 00:15:07,502
PARIS CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT,
FRANCE

205
00:15:07,586 --> 00:15:09,296
Mommy, it's me, Jiu.

206
00:15:11,131 --> 00:15:12,674
Jiu, you feeling all right?

207
00:15:13,175 --> 00:15:14,926
- Were you scared on the plane?
- <i>No.</i>

208
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:19,139
<i>After I slept and woke up, I ate
food, then I played with Uncle.</i>

209
00:15:19,222 --> 00:15:22,309
Well done, Jiu.
I'm proud of you.

210
00:15:22,893 --> 00:15:26,188
Emma, this is my mommy. Isn't
she pretty?

211
00:15:26,271 --> 00:15:27,397
<i>She is.</i>

212
00:15:27,481 --> 00:15:29,983
<i>Taera, don't worry about us.
Everything okay with you?</i>

213
00:15:30,067 --> 00:15:31,985
Yes, I'm fine.

214
00:15:32,861 --> 00:15:34,488
This won't be easy on Jiu.

215
00:15:34,571 --> 00:15:35,906
Please take care of her.

216
00:15:37,699 --> 00:15:39,259
Thank you for always
being there for us.

217
00:15:43,538 --> 00:15:45,373
We're headed to southern France.

218
00:15:45,457 --> 00:15:46,875
I'll call you when we arrive.

219
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:49,669
<i>Bye, Mommy!</i>

220
00:16:23,203 --> 00:16:24,788
What did you just say?

221
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,962
I killed Director Kim Seondeok
of Hanwool Mental Hospital.

222
00:16:36,383 --> 00:16:39,553
You just confessed
to committing a murder, correct?

223
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:41,680
Yes.

224
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,391
Okay. Let's confirm your
statement again.

225
00:16:44,474 --> 00:16:49,229
Did you murder Director Kim Seondeok at
around 9:00 p.m. on March 31, Ms. Hong?

226
00:16:50,438 --> 00:16:51,523
Yes.

227
00:16:52,107 --> 00:16:54,067
I stabbed her with a knife.

228
00:16:54,151 --> 00:16:58,280
And that knife was the knife attached
to Director Kim's cane, correct?

229
00:16:59,906 --> 00:17:01,116
Correct.

230
00:17:02,325 --> 00:17:06,913
No fingerprints were found on the gloves
and infrared goggles found at the scene.

231
00:17:06,997 --> 00:17:09,833
Do you have any proof
to corroborate your story?

232
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:12,627
The proof is inside the bag
I brought here.

233
00:17:13,837 --> 00:17:16,965
The bloodstained dress
I wore at the event.

234
00:17:27,642 --> 00:17:30,604
Blood tests will prove
that it's Director Kim's.

235
00:17:31,813 --> 00:17:32,856
Check for yourselves.

236
00:17:32,939 --> 00:17:37,235
But we didn't find any bloodstains on
the dress you showed us at your house.

237
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:39,446
You're saying you
manipulated evidence?

238
00:17:39,529 --> 00:17:43,450
My husband did it to prevent
me from turning myself in.

239
00:17:44,409 --> 00:17:46,953
So Mr. Pyo is your accomplice.

240
00:17:48,205 --> 00:17:50,165
And your motive?
Why'd you kill her?

241
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:53,710
A personal vendetta.

242
00:17:59,049 --> 00:18:00,675
<i>I detested her enough…</i>

243
00:18:02,719 --> 00:18:04,304
<i>to kill her.</i>

244
00:18:12,479 --> 00:18:15,106
Yes. Yes, sir. Mr. Han?

245
00:18:15,774 --> 00:18:16,775
Yes, it's me.

246
00:18:17,442 --> 00:18:19,736
About the promotion
to senior superintendent,

247
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,947
does the offer still stand?

248
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:25,158
Oh, yes. I thought I'd let you
in on a special secret.

249
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:29,371
Of course, Detective Joo. We're
in this together, to the end.

250
00:18:29,454 --> 00:18:31,581
You know I can keep a secret.

251
00:18:31,665 --> 00:18:34,417
Great, let's talk again.

252
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,343
Yay!

253
00:18:47,097 --> 00:18:49,057
Taera turned herself in?

254
00:18:52,185 --> 00:18:54,688
So now she's going
to ruin my life.

255
00:18:54,771 --> 00:18:57,399
It's vetted information
from a police reporter.

256
00:18:58,066 --> 00:19:00,652
Police are keeping quiet,
but the press will know soon.

257
00:19:03,113 --> 00:19:05,365
But isn't it strange?

258
00:19:05,448 --> 00:19:07,701
Taera only confessed
to murdering Kim.

259
00:19:08,326 --> 00:19:10,161
She isn't admitting
to killing my father.

260
00:19:12,122 --> 00:19:15,125
She's keeping her silence
because there's no proof anyway.

261
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:16,876
How cowardly is Taera,

262
00:19:17,502 --> 00:19:18,878
the woman you love.

263
00:19:18,962 --> 00:19:20,880
No.

264
00:19:22,299 --> 00:19:24,050
How can you let
her do this to you?

265
00:19:24,134 --> 00:19:26,720
How can you let her
destroy your whole life?

266
00:19:26,803 --> 00:19:30,140
At this rate, it won't just be your
candidacy but your entire career.

267
00:19:30,223 --> 00:19:33,893
- You won't even recover Hatch...
- No, no! No!

268
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:36,771
Was it you?

269
00:19:37,689 --> 00:19:39,816
Did you force her
to turn herself in?

270
00:19:41,192 --> 00:19:44,904
Taera would never betray me.
This is your doing. You did this!

271
00:19:44,988 --> 00:19:47,282
What do you want from me?
Why'd you do this?

272
00:19:47,365 --> 00:19:50,952
You want to see my whole life
go up in flames, huh?

273
00:19:56,499 --> 00:19:58,918
Get it together, Pyo Jaehyun!

274
00:20:00,045 --> 00:20:02,297
Yes, that was the plan.

275
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:06,426
I only returned to reveal Taera's
sins because I found concrete proof.

276
00:20:07,594 --> 00:20:08,762
Proof?

277
00:20:15,018 --> 00:20:16,978
Taera was hiding this.

278
00:20:17,062 --> 00:20:19,189
The hard drive
containing Hanwool's secrets.

279
00:20:20,065 --> 00:20:22,150
It's encrypted,
so I haven't looked inside.

280
00:20:22,233 --> 00:20:25,445
But I'm certain this contains evidence
that Hong Taera is an assassin.

281
00:20:26,738 --> 00:20:29,491
The feral dog symbol on the screen,
I saw it at the annex building...

282
00:20:29,574 --> 00:20:31,284
Wait, wait, wait, Haesoo.

283
00:20:32,327 --> 00:20:35,622
You're giving that
to the police?

284
00:20:45,382 --> 00:20:46,966
But I pity you too much.

285
00:20:48,343 --> 00:20:50,929
It's so hard seeing you suffer
because of Taera.

286
00:20:54,557 --> 00:20:57,185
Jaehyun, you have
to become president.

287
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:01,564
Take revenge on Jang Kummo, Jang Dojin
and Hong Taera, by proving yourself.

288
00:21:03,108 --> 00:21:06,861
Rise to the pinnacle of power and
show them what misery feels like.

289
00:21:06,945 --> 00:21:09,656
Let me help you take revenge.

290
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:13,201
Revenge?

291
00:21:24,921 --> 00:21:26,089
I need you.

292
00:21:27,465 --> 00:21:28,550
Help me, please.

293
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:35,223
I know how you feel,

294
00:21:35,849 --> 00:21:37,934
how lonely and furious
you must be now.

295
00:21:38,601 --> 00:21:40,145
I felt the same way.

296
00:21:44,983 --> 00:21:46,484
Let's get Taera out now.

297
00:21:47,986 --> 00:21:48,987
What?

298
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:52,699
From this moment forward, I'll do
anything to make you president.

299
00:21:53,408 --> 00:21:55,118
But I ask one favor.

300
00:21:55,201 --> 00:21:56,870
You save Taera

301
00:21:57,454 --> 00:22:00,582
so I can end her by my hand.

302
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:15,000
(gabbyusubs.com)

303
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,145
Mother, Taera is giving her
statement without an attorney.

304
00:22:19,813 --> 00:22:21,231
We have to help her somehow.

305
00:22:21,314 --> 00:22:23,274
Are you going to
leave her like that?

306
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:27,612
She asked me not to do anything.

307
00:22:31,074 --> 00:22:33,326
You knew she was
turning herself in?

308
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:35,453
She called this morning.

309
00:22:36,037 --> 00:22:38,581
She asked that I wait,
whatever the outcome.

310
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:42,168
What is she thinking?

311
00:22:42,252 --> 00:22:45,672
I don't see why she'd make such a
risky choice. It's still too early.

312
00:22:45,755 --> 00:22:46,923
Let's trust her.

313
00:22:47,006 --> 00:22:50,552
Taera is a strong person. I'm sure
she has something up her sleeve.

314
00:22:54,264 --> 00:22:55,515
Oh, right.

315
00:22:58,143 --> 00:22:59,227
Do you perhaps…

316
00:23:00,311 --> 00:23:04,357
remember the red sports car
Dojin used to drive?

317
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,152
Oh, yes. I remember.
It was Father's gift to him.

318
00:23:07,235 --> 00:23:08,486
Yes, that one.

319
00:23:09,195 --> 00:23:10,780
I later found out

320
00:23:10,864 --> 00:23:13,783
that he scrapped the car when
it was still practically new.

321
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:15,660
Why?

322
00:23:15,743 --> 00:23:17,579
The day Sujeong went missing,

323
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:22,041
Sungchan went to pick her up from
her home in Dojin's sports car.

324
00:23:23,126 --> 00:23:25,253
Then Sujeong went
missing afterwards.

325
00:23:25,336 --> 00:23:27,463
A week later, the
car was scrapped.

326
00:23:29,465 --> 00:23:31,467
So something was in that car.

327
00:23:31,968 --> 00:23:33,887
A secret no one must know.

328
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:35,513
My thoughts exactly.

329
00:23:36,306 --> 00:23:37,599
Do you have any ideas?

330
00:23:39,475 --> 00:23:40,935
That day at the lab,

331
00:23:41,728 --> 00:23:44,147
I think there was an experiment
I wasn't aware of.

332
00:23:50,236 --> 00:23:51,988
Did you happen to see Sujeong?

333
00:23:52,071 --> 00:23:56,492
Sujeong? No, I haven't.
Are you at the lab now?

334
00:23:57,243 --> 00:23:59,621
<i>The boys definitely
went to the lab that day.</i>

335
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:01,956
They erased the records,
but I'm sure of it.

336
00:24:02,665 --> 00:24:06,961
What if they used her as a test
subject due to her leg paralysis?

337
00:24:08,004 --> 00:24:09,797
It may have put her at risk.

338
00:24:10,381 --> 00:24:13,801
Are you saying that Sujeong
might actually be dead?

339
00:24:17,639 --> 00:24:22,185
Do you remember Red, the chimpanzee
that Hatch presented recently?

340
00:24:24,437 --> 00:24:26,689
The successful smart
patch experiment?

341
00:24:26,773 --> 00:24:28,233
The name Red,

342
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:32,779
Sujeong and I used to talk about
that name all the time.

343
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:37,742
We were gonna use it for a
chimpanzee in our future experiments.

344
00:24:39,661 --> 00:24:41,621
It may be a coincidence…

345
00:24:45,291 --> 00:24:47,794
but I think Sujeong
is alive, Mother.

346
00:24:51,297 --> 00:24:53,216
The situation looks very dire.

347
00:24:53,299 --> 00:24:55,551
Rumors are out
even before the police briefing.

348
00:24:55,635 --> 00:24:57,929
Supporters are turning
their backs on us too.

349
00:24:58,012 --> 00:24:59,180
Due to Ms. Hong's case…

350
00:24:59,722 --> 00:25:03,559
…whatever the truth is, it looks
like the campaign can't be saved.

351
00:25:05,687 --> 00:25:08,022
Did Ms. Hong really
kill Director Kim?

352
00:25:08,523 --> 00:25:09,941
Did you know about this?

353
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:14,821
Please say something!

354
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:20,785
If you don't tell us these things, we
can't help you, even if we want to.

355
00:25:20,868 --> 00:25:23,663
We can only take care of issues
if we know what's happening!

356
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:27,959
Watch your mouth.

357
00:25:30,712 --> 00:25:32,213
You must have the wrong idea.

358
00:25:33,089 --> 00:25:34,632
I'm going be the president,

359
00:25:34,716 --> 00:25:37,760
and all you need to do
is to follow orders.

360
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:41,306
I'll handle my wife's
ordeal. Got that?

361
00:25:44,267 --> 00:25:45,268
Fine.

362
00:25:49,397 --> 00:25:51,316
I can't work like this anymore.

363
00:25:52,692 --> 00:25:55,445
If you can't win the trust
of the people closest to you,

364
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:58,072
how will you govern a nation?

365
00:26:00,241 --> 00:26:03,453
I hope you stop wasting your
energy on worthless matters.

366
00:26:07,373 --> 00:26:08,666
Come on. Let's go.

367
00:26:13,087 --> 00:26:15,757
Damn, those dim-witted morons.

368
00:26:16,466 --> 00:26:19,344
No wonder they grovel at someone
else's feet their whole lives.

369
00:26:40,823 --> 00:26:44,869
I wish you a speedy recovery so you
can get back on your feet again.

370
00:26:45,578 --> 00:26:46,913
I'll try to do better.

371
00:26:58,674 --> 00:27:02,387
Why would you take care of your
father-in-law after the divorce?

372
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:04,722
Are you getting back
together with Dojin?

373
00:27:04,806 --> 00:27:06,724
Not only is Chairman Jang
my father-in-law,

374
00:27:06,808 --> 00:27:08,601
he's the grandfather of my son

375
00:27:08,684 --> 00:27:11,854
and my late father's
oldest friend.

376
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,859
He cared for me like
I was his daughter.

377
00:27:23,449 --> 00:27:25,201
<i>You look like you've seen a
ghost.</i>

378
00:27:26,661 --> 00:27:27,662
That's upsetting.

379
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:30,373
After all, I was your wife once.

380
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:34,252
When we were young, you made a
promise that you'd protect me,

381
00:27:34,335 --> 00:27:36,003
even if it costs your life.

382
00:27:36,671 --> 00:27:37,880
Don't you remember?

383
00:27:39,841 --> 00:27:41,801
What happened to you?

384
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:44,178
I thought you went abroad.

385
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:47,765
You set me up to be
shipped off abroad.

386
00:27:50,518 --> 00:27:52,478
Were you always so shameless,

387
00:27:52,979 --> 00:27:55,690
or did you decide
to become that way?

388
00:27:56,774 --> 00:28:00,445
Did you really think I'd go overseas
without Leo because you said so?

389
00:28:00,528 --> 00:28:01,779
What gives you the right?

390
00:28:04,824 --> 00:28:07,201
I'm going to survive
by doing things my way.

391
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:12,123
Don't you dare provoke me,

392
00:28:12,206 --> 00:28:14,459
unless you want to lose
your precious Kumjo Group.

393
00:28:22,175 --> 00:28:25,303
Don't worry about your father.
I'll take very good care of him.

394
00:28:25,386 --> 00:28:28,681
I wouldn't want him
to die so easily.

395
00:29:01,047 --> 00:29:02,048
Honey.

396
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,721
Jiu.

397
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:15,353
Taera!

398
00:29:19,065 --> 00:29:20,066
Hong Taera.

399
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:28,699
<i>Despite who I might've been in
the past?</i>

400
00:29:29,575 --> 00:29:32,161
<i>I would've loved you,
no matter who you were.</i>

401
00:29:32,828 --> 00:29:36,082
<i>And I will continue to do so
for the rest of my life.</i>

402
00:29:36,791 --> 00:29:39,544
<i>No matter what you do,</i>

403
00:29:39,627 --> 00:29:41,462
<i>I'm going to trust
you and follow you</i>

404
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:44,549
and stay by your side forever.

405
00:29:49,762 --> 00:29:50,763
Taera.

406
00:29:58,479 --> 00:29:59,480
Taera.

407
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:04,777
Taera!

408
00:30:29,802 --> 00:30:33,639
We'll learn the truth soon enough,
but are you really the killer?

409
00:30:34,557 --> 00:30:36,767
If we found out
you've given false testimony,

410
00:30:36,851 --> 00:30:38,561
there will be legal
ramifications.

411
00:30:40,646 --> 00:30:41,939
Where are we going?

412
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,525
Someone requested
a special visit with you.

413
00:31:01,667 --> 00:31:03,628
I appreciate you doing this.

414
00:31:03,711 --> 00:31:06,172
We only allowed this
because it's you, Ms. Ko.

415
00:31:06,255 --> 00:31:07,340
You have ten minutes.

416
00:31:29,612 --> 00:31:31,489
Are you doing everything
as I've instructed?

417
00:31:35,785 --> 00:31:38,204
Why are you here?
What if Jaehyun finds out?

418
00:31:39,872 --> 00:31:42,416
You said you'd do anything
I tell you to do, right?

419
00:31:43,084 --> 00:31:45,044
Send Jiu abroad.

420
00:31:46,879 --> 00:31:49,298
Should your daughter suffer
like your brother?

421
00:31:50,216 --> 00:31:53,052
Why should an innocent girl
watch her parents get punished?

422
00:31:54,512 --> 00:31:59,350
You have any idea how agonizing it is to
be the subject of the nation's gossip?

423
00:32:03,521 --> 00:32:06,357
Turn yourself in and tell them
you murdered Director Kim.

424
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:10,820
However, do not
mention my father.

425
00:32:10,903 --> 00:32:14,657
I have to tell them what I did to reveal
that Jang Kummo is the mastermind.

426
00:32:15,991 --> 00:32:20,037
I have to sacrifice myself to
punish Uhm Sangbae and Pyo Jaehyun.

427
00:32:20,121 --> 00:32:21,706
You said you'd do
anything I say.

428
00:32:22,415 --> 00:32:27,169
Since Kim Seondeok's dead, your confession
won't be enough to bring those two down.

429
00:32:27,253 --> 00:32:28,421
I can prove it.

430
00:32:28,504 --> 00:32:29,964
Listen to me, Taera.

431
00:32:33,801 --> 00:32:35,010
Aren't you curious

432
00:32:35,761 --> 00:32:38,139
what Jaehyun might do
if you turn yourself in?

433
00:32:39,557 --> 00:32:40,933
Will he save you,

434
00:32:41,934 --> 00:32:43,352
or will he abandon you?

435
00:32:44,353 --> 00:32:48,941
The Jaehyun that you know, what
choice do you think would he make?

436
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:56,198
If Jaehyun doesn't save you,

437
00:32:57,074 --> 00:32:59,368
you will end up behind
bars for murder.

438
00:32:59,452 --> 00:33:00,745
I don't care.

439
00:33:02,037 --> 00:33:03,956
I'm going to reveal everything,

440
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:06,250
including the fact
that I shot Ko Taesun.

441
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:14,216
You're going to be a cruel bitch
to me to the end.

442
00:33:15,676 --> 00:33:17,303
When will you drop the act?

443
00:33:18,637 --> 00:33:22,057
You're not the one who killed my
father. Your brother shot him.

444
00:33:24,268 --> 00:33:25,978
My brother didn't shoot him.

445
00:33:26,061 --> 00:33:27,563
It was me. I shot him.

446
00:33:29,023 --> 00:33:31,942
Your brother told me everything.
I know the truth.

447
00:33:33,819 --> 00:33:35,780
<i>Hong Taera is taking the fall
for my sins</i>

448
00:33:35,863 --> 00:33:38,741
<i>and will reveal her identity as No.
50 to the world, like a fool,</i>

449
00:33:39,992 --> 00:33:41,952
to protect you
from getting hurt.

450
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:48,375
My brother did nothing wrong.
He was only ten, just a child.

451
00:33:50,169 --> 00:33:51,504
The assassination

452
00:33:52,546 --> 00:33:54,298
was assigned to me.

453
00:33:57,802 --> 00:33:59,345
It's all my fault.

454
00:34:03,015 --> 00:34:05,226
Please take pity on my brother.

455
00:34:05,976 --> 00:34:09,605
I beg of you.
I'm sorry, Haesoo.

456
00:34:09,688 --> 00:34:11,232
I'm so sorry.

457
00:34:11,899 --> 00:34:13,901
Let… Let me take all the blame.

458
00:34:14,819 --> 00:34:16,987
Spare my brother, Haesoo.

459
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:26,080
As of today,

460
00:34:27,623 --> 00:34:29,250
you owe me nothing.

461
00:34:35,756 --> 00:34:38,467
Out of everyone, I'm the only
one who has reason to punish you.

462
00:34:39,635 --> 00:34:43,180
And if I've forgiven you,
there's nothing more to be said.

463
00:34:47,977 --> 00:34:49,186
Our only concern now

464
00:34:50,104 --> 00:34:54,233
is to figure out how to kill the bastards
who cornered us into this miserable fate.

465
00:34:58,654 --> 00:35:00,614
First, I'll get you out of here.

466
00:35:00,698 --> 00:35:02,616
Your fate is in Jaehyun's hands,

467
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:06,287
and only I have
his ear right now.

468
00:35:38,944 --> 00:35:42,573
When the smart patch stimulates
motor nerves at a high frequency,

469
00:35:43,616 --> 00:35:45,784
the nerves in your legs,
which are paralyzed,

470
00:35:45,868 --> 00:35:48,120
will respond to the command
from the brain.

471
00:35:48,203 --> 00:35:50,581
You could be the
athlete you once were.

472
00:35:50,664 --> 00:35:53,834
There aren't any
side effects, right?

473
00:35:53,918 --> 00:35:56,754
Of course not. Hatch has
the world's best technology.

474
00:35:57,588 --> 00:35:58,589
No need to worry.

475
00:36:00,299 --> 00:36:02,176
So, let's begin.

476
00:36:02,676 --> 00:36:04,261
Just relax.

477
00:36:16,065 --> 00:36:17,775
I'm going to raise
the stimulation.

478
00:36:26,825 --> 00:36:28,744
Can you move your legs?

479
00:36:33,415 --> 00:36:34,458
I can't.

480
00:36:34,541 --> 00:36:36,335
I'll raise it a bit more.

481
00:36:50,432 --> 00:36:51,892
I can move them.

482
00:36:53,435 --> 00:36:56,105
I can move my legs again.

483
00:36:56,188 --> 00:36:58,649
Create more force with your legs.
-Okay.

484
00:37:06,448 --> 00:37:08,575
That hurts.

485
00:37:23,465 --> 00:37:26,844
Shall we stop here for today?

486
00:37:27,636 --> 00:37:30,014
Pushing yourself too far
isn't always the best.

487
00:37:32,975 --> 00:37:35,519
- Good job.
- Thank you.

488
00:37:52,453 --> 00:37:53,787
Mommy!

489
00:37:56,457 --> 00:37:57,458
Leo.

490
00:37:57,541 --> 00:38:01,003
Why are you here, Mommy? Do
you know how much I missed you?

491
00:38:01,086 --> 00:38:04,506
Mommy missed you so much too.

492
00:38:05,758 --> 00:38:09,053
I'm sorry. I'll never go
anywhere without you again.

493
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:11,513
But how did you get here?

494
00:38:12,264 --> 00:38:13,557
I came with Grandma.

495
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,021
Mother.

496
00:38:25,486 --> 00:38:27,237
Na-na na-na boo-boo.

497
00:38:30,699 --> 00:38:33,952
Hong told me about all the awful
things that Kummo had done.

498
00:38:36,789 --> 00:38:38,916
She asked me to
take care of you.

499
00:38:41,668 --> 00:38:43,128
That man is a monster.

500
00:38:43,212 --> 00:38:45,464
He won't be forgiven,
even in death.

501
00:38:46,924 --> 00:38:48,634
I'm sure it's been
tough for you.

502
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:53,513
When I think of the countless times
you hit rock bottom on the inside,

503
00:38:54,014 --> 00:38:55,432
I feel terrible for you.

504
00:38:57,768 --> 00:38:59,311
I'm sorry, Haesoo.

505
00:39:06,485 --> 00:39:09,279
I know you won't be getting
back together with Dojin,

506
00:39:10,531 --> 00:39:12,032
so what will you do now?

507
00:39:13,325 --> 00:39:16,662
How can I be of
assistance to you?

508
00:39:26,713 --> 00:39:30,092
How's the atmosphere among reporters?
Are you dealing with the rumors?

509
00:39:30,175 --> 00:39:32,386
I think one of the cops
approached Han Kyungrok.

510
00:39:33,512 --> 00:39:36,974
A <i>Yusun Ilbo</i> reporter submitted an
in-depth article about Ms. Hong.

511
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,227
Detective Joo, that scumbag.

512
00:39:40,936 --> 00:39:43,522
Arrange a meeting with the
Y<i>usun </i>reporter discreetly.

513
00:39:45,566 --> 00:39:46,567
This is it.

514
00:39:48,277 --> 00:39:49,736
I can't do this anymore, so...

515
00:39:52,906 --> 00:39:55,200
Jackasses like you are the
worst.

516
00:39:55,284 --> 00:39:58,004
You betrayed Haesoo for money, and
now you care about your conscience?

517
00:39:58,996 --> 00:40:00,164
Hey.

518
00:40:00,247 --> 00:40:04,168
Let's keep going, if you want to
keep your lousy job as a reporter.

519
00:40:30,402 --> 00:40:32,988
Make sure the chairman
stays in the ICU for a while.

520
00:40:33,655 --> 00:40:37,451
Tell the press his recovery is slow
and make sure his family doesn't know.

521
00:40:42,664 --> 00:40:45,417
Is it a secret that Dr. Liam
is coming from the States?

522
00:40:46,418 --> 00:40:48,837
All his treatments
will be confidential.

523
00:40:48,921 --> 00:40:52,799
This is all for the chairman,
so I trust you'll follow suit.

524
00:41:08,941 --> 00:41:10,150
<i>Where are you now?</i>

525
00:41:10,984 --> 00:41:11,985
I'm drinking.

526
00:41:12,778 --> 00:41:14,571
I can't sleep sober.

527
00:41:14,655 --> 00:41:16,865
You don't have time
to sit there and drink.

528
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:19,743
I think Father is
going to wake up soon.

529
00:41:21,203 --> 00:41:23,622
Mr. Uhm is secretly bringing
a doctor from the US.

530
00:41:24,831 --> 00:41:26,124
Why would he do that?

531
00:41:26,208 --> 00:41:27,834
Dojin must've asked him to.

532
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:32,297
He needs his father
alive to get to you.

533
00:41:35,008 --> 00:41:36,009
Mr. Uhm.

534
00:41:37,928 --> 00:41:39,680
What the hell are you doing?

535
00:41:46,853 --> 00:41:48,397
<i>But I ask one favor.</i>

536
00:41:49,606 --> 00:41:51,108
You save Taera

537
00:41:51,984 --> 00:41:55,279
so I can end her by my hand.

538
00:42:04,454 --> 00:42:06,331
Only I control the narrative.

539
00:42:31,398 --> 00:42:34,985
What the hell did you do
to the flash drive, Hong Yura?

540
00:42:35,068 --> 00:42:37,571
It was working fine.
Why is the software glitching?

541
00:42:42,367 --> 00:42:45,912
My whole life depends on this!

542
00:42:48,582 --> 00:42:52,419
The things I have done
to get my hands on it…

543
00:42:54,421 --> 00:42:56,715
<i>You were the ones who made me
like this.</i>

544
00:42:56,798 --> 00:43:00,844
<i>That day, someone pushed
my bike off the cliff.</i>

545
00:43:00,927 --> 00:43:03,513
<i>Jaehyun, Dojin, or you!</i>

546
00:43:03,597 --> 00:43:05,640
<i>One of you three
tried to kill me!</i>

547
00:43:05,724 --> 00:43:08,894
Here. Here! Over here!

548
00:43:11,688 --> 00:43:13,607
Help me!

549
00:43:36,463 --> 00:43:37,464
Is he dead?

550
00:43:58,693 --> 00:44:01,113
I can make this
software just as well.

551
00:44:03,657 --> 00:44:05,283
If the presentation goes well,

552
00:44:06,118 --> 00:44:07,452
Hatch will be mine.

553
00:44:08,745 --> 00:44:10,789
That bastard Jaehyun,
and even Kyojin,

554
00:44:12,749 --> 00:44:14,209
can't lay a finger on me.

555
00:44:16,336 --> 00:44:17,337
I will be…

556
00:44:18,922 --> 00:44:20,132
untouchable.

557
00:44:28,265 --> 00:44:29,558
Don't tell me…

558
00:44:31,059 --> 00:44:32,602
it was you, Sungchan.

559
00:44:44,281 --> 00:44:47,451
Like a fool, she risked her life
to save a scumbag like you.

560
00:44:47,534 --> 00:44:49,161
She trusted you so much.

561
00:44:49,911 --> 00:44:53,123
But how could you betray her
for some pocket change?

562
00:44:59,171 --> 00:45:01,756
Shit. Don't take it out on me.

563
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:04,843
You're the one who abandoned
the woman you loved so much!

564
00:45:05,427 --> 00:45:08,722
So you should've protected her!
At least you should've protected…

565
00:45:10,056 --> 00:45:11,224
that poor woman.

566
00:45:17,939 --> 00:45:20,108
Don't ever talk
about Haesoo again.

567
00:45:20,192 --> 00:45:22,360
If you tell Jaehyun
anything about her,

568
00:45:23,945 --> 00:45:25,322
I'll kill you myself.

569
00:45:37,792 --> 00:45:40,253
Ms. Hong, thanks for your
theatrics as the culprit.

570
00:45:40,337 --> 00:45:42,964
I'm pissed that you made a joke
of the police.

571
00:45:43,048 --> 00:45:45,342
You will pay for making a
mockery of the nation.

572
00:45:46,259 --> 00:45:47,761
What are you talking about?

573
00:45:47,844 --> 00:45:50,639
The blood tests revealed
that the blood was not Kim's.

574
00:45:52,641 --> 00:45:54,267
What do you think you're doing?

575
00:45:54,351 --> 00:45:55,727
Are you insane?

576
00:45:56,436 --> 00:45:57,938
You know what?

577
00:45:58,021 --> 00:46:01,733
People are going to wonder
if you're actually crazy.

578
00:46:02,234 --> 00:46:04,986
What you did is more
consequential than you think.

579
00:46:10,158 --> 00:46:11,993
<i>Jaehyun's starting to make his
move.</i>

580
00:46:17,916 --> 00:46:20,877
As you said, Taera will go
through a psychiatric evaluation.

581
00:46:20,961 --> 00:46:22,629
For now, you can relax.

582
00:46:22,712 --> 00:46:24,464
Good work, Mr. Uhm.

583
00:46:25,465 --> 00:46:28,385
Make sure the psychiatrists
don't say a word.

584
00:46:30,428 --> 00:46:31,721
More importantly,

585
00:46:31,805 --> 00:46:35,308
Ms. Min forced Chairman Jang's
fingerprint onto the stock waiver.

586
00:46:36,476 --> 00:46:38,979
Dojin will say it's invalid,
but it won't be easy.

587
00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:41,856
So I was thinking,

588
00:46:43,066 --> 00:46:45,735
before the stocks
all go to Ms. Min,

589
00:46:45,819 --> 00:46:48,572
what if I took over
Kumjo Distribution early?

590
00:46:49,614 --> 00:46:50,657
Ah.

591
00:46:51,324 --> 00:46:53,118
I made you wait for too long.

592
00:46:53,994 --> 00:46:56,121
I should've remembered.
Sorry for the delay.

593
00:46:56,204 --> 00:46:58,123
I've been out of sorts lately.

594
00:46:58,206 --> 00:47:00,292
It's all right.
Of course I know.

595
00:47:01,084 --> 00:47:03,962
I just thought we
should make it official.

596
00:47:04,546 --> 00:47:06,965
This doesn't offend you, does
it? -

597
00:47:07,465 --> 00:47:08,466
Of course not.

598
00:47:09,467 --> 00:47:11,469
You're only asking
for what was promised.

599
00:47:13,471 --> 00:47:14,806
How is Chairman Jang?

600
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:18,393
Is he still unconscious?

601
00:47:19,185 --> 00:47:22,647
I'm a bit concerned. Maybe because
Haesoo's taking care of him.

602
00:47:22,731 --> 00:47:23,857
Don't worry.

603
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:27,444
Dr. Choi says it's impossible for
him to fully regain consciousness.

604
00:47:28,695 --> 00:47:30,030
Is that so?

605
00:47:31,323 --> 00:47:32,949
If that's what you say.

606
00:47:34,618 --> 00:47:35,869
Thank you, Mr. Uhm,

607
00:47:37,412 --> 00:47:40,123
for always helping me
make the right choice.

608
00:47:47,922 --> 00:47:49,966
How dare you call me again.

609
00:47:52,177 --> 00:47:55,096
You think the presidential
candidacy makes you bulletproof?

610
00:47:57,057 --> 00:48:00,894
He called us, and
yet he's alone.

611
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:05,815
I guess it takes
a man of tenacity

612
00:48:06,316 --> 00:48:08,109
to live with a
woman like No. 50.

613
00:48:09,069 --> 00:48:10,528
Mr. Jo Gyutae.

614
00:48:12,238 --> 00:48:16,034
You were treated at Hanwool
for drug addiction.

615
00:48:16,743 --> 00:48:18,912
That must be where
you met Director Kim.

616
00:48:19,996 --> 00:48:20,997
Ah.

617
00:48:21,748 --> 00:48:24,542
She must've loved that you
were in the Special Forces.

618
00:48:24,626 --> 00:48:26,753
Perfect for her
killers-for-hire business, no?

619
00:48:29,297 --> 00:48:32,634
You must've been furious when she
sacked you, her first hit man.

620
00:48:34,511 --> 00:48:36,096
How do you know that?

621
00:48:37,847 --> 00:48:40,975
NO. 1, JO GYUTAE
SPECIAL FORCES, DRUG ADDICTION

622
00:48:45,146 --> 00:48:46,981
NO. 91, KANG JIMIN
SPECIAL FORCES

623
00:48:48,692 --> 00:48:49,734
Aw.

624
00:48:50,443 --> 00:48:52,696
You must've been quite
jealous of No. 105.

625
00:48:53,613 --> 00:48:56,449
Apparently,
No. 105 beat you in all aspects.

626
00:48:56,533 --> 00:48:58,201
Shut it, you son of a bitch.

627
00:49:02,706 --> 00:49:07,335
You'd rather reveal everything than
be cornered because of Hong Taera?

628
00:49:08,670 --> 00:49:10,213
Does that change anything?

629
00:49:11,005 --> 00:49:13,717
Your campaign is already
dead in the water.

630
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:17,053
- The whole world knows.
- Is that right?

631
00:49:17,137 --> 00:49:19,597
Are you not here to
ask me to kill Taera?

632
00:49:20,598 --> 00:49:23,184
You didn't think you'd
need my help again…

633
00:49:23,268 --> 00:49:26,438
…when you sold me out
to Director Kim, did you?

634
00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:29,816
You're so pathetic.

635
00:49:32,068 --> 00:49:33,486
Aren't you the pathetic one?

636
00:49:34,696 --> 00:49:39,451
If you boss around your little
lackeys, does it boost your ego?

637
00:49:40,034 --> 00:49:41,286
Piece of shit!

638
00:49:43,288 --> 00:49:44,497
Oh.

639
00:49:44,581 --> 00:49:45,915
Mind your words.

640
00:49:46,499 --> 00:49:49,461
How dare you speak to your
future president with that tone!

641
00:49:53,923 --> 00:49:56,259
I will become a
president by any means,

642
00:49:56,342 --> 00:49:59,095
and I won't tolerate
any slip of the tongue.

643
00:49:59,179 --> 00:50:02,182
You will abandon
all your crude street ways,

644
00:50:03,224 --> 00:50:05,769
and you will dress more neatly.

645
00:50:07,312 --> 00:50:08,813
Smile a little.

646
00:50:11,107 --> 00:50:15,320
I think hierarchy is important, so
make sure you don't cross the line.

647
00:50:15,945 --> 00:50:17,322
What's this about?

648
00:50:19,616 --> 00:50:20,909
I'm scouting you

649
00:50:21,451 --> 00:50:24,329
as the presidential
advisory board.

650
00:50:29,584 --> 00:50:31,586
I have no intention
of revealing who you are.

651
00:50:32,629 --> 00:50:36,299
I'll wipe clean your
background records.

652
00:50:36,382 --> 00:50:40,011
However, you'll need to prove
your loyalty to me.

653
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:43,807
I need you

654
00:50:45,517 --> 00:50:46,518
to free Hong Taera.

655
00:50:49,604 --> 00:50:51,481
This is all bullshit.

656
00:50:51,564 --> 00:50:53,900
He will use us and
then discard us.

657
00:50:53,983 --> 00:50:56,110
Mr. Jo, let's get
rid of him right now.

658
00:50:56,611 --> 00:50:59,239
I just explained myself.
I guess old habits die hard.

659
00:51:00,615 --> 00:51:02,492
Don't carry around
this junk anymore.

660
00:51:03,243 --> 00:51:04,410
It's not very classy.

661
00:51:04,494 --> 00:51:05,954
How dare you, bastard.

662
00:51:06,037 --> 00:51:07,038
Mr. Jo,

663
00:51:08,039 --> 00:51:09,332
just give me the word.

664
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:11,835
So what do you think?

665
00:51:12,544 --> 00:51:14,796
Presidential advisory board.

666
00:51:16,422 --> 00:51:17,507
Team Leader Jo Gyutae.

667
00:51:19,342 --> 00:51:21,386
- Mr. Jo.
- Team Leader Jo Gyutae!

668
00:51:23,179 --> 00:51:25,306
Why not live a life
of luxury for once

669
00:51:27,183 --> 00:51:28,268
by working for me?

670
00:51:45,785 --> 00:51:48,580
I'm here to file a report.

671
00:51:49,289 --> 00:51:51,040
What is it about?

672
00:51:52,208 --> 00:51:55,920
I'm here to report the real
killer of Director Kim.

673
00:51:56,921 --> 00:51:58,131
Please follow us.

674
00:51:59,173 --> 00:52:01,384
Listen, I have evidence too.

675
00:52:02,594 --> 00:52:03,595
Here.

676
00:52:04,262 --> 00:52:07,098
This killer is trying
to kill me too.

677
00:52:08,182 --> 00:52:10,685
Please help me. Please?

678
00:52:12,270 --> 00:52:15,315
Who the hell are you? Let go!

679
00:52:15,398 --> 00:52:16,441
What the hell?

680
00:52:17,150 --> 00:52:20,028
You're under arrest for the
murder of Director Kim Seondeok.

681
00:52:20,111 --> 00:52:23,239
You have the right to remain silent...
-Wait. What did you say?

682
00:52:23,323 --> 00:52:24,657
I murdered Kim Seondeok?

683
00:52:24,741 --> 00:52:26,534
- Hey, start searching.
- Yes, sir.

684
00:52:26,618 --> 00:52:29,078
Hey, uncuff me.
This is a misunderstanding.

685
00:52:29,162 --> 00:52:30,914
Uncuff me immediately!

686
00:52:30,997 --> 00:52:32,999
<i>Mr. Uhm Sangbae
and Director Kim</i>

687
00:52:33,708 --> 00:52:35,418
were business partners.

688
00:52:36,461 --> 00:52:39,505
From illegally admitting
patients to confinement,

689
00:52:39,589 --> 00:52:41,674
she did everything
he paid her for.

690
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:45,929
I retrieved this hard drive
from Director Kim's computer.

691
00:52:47,722 --> 00:52:51,476
<i>The man who introduced Director
Kim to people of the elite class</i>

692
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:53,478
<i>was Mr. Uhm.</i>

693
00:52:53,978 --> 00:52:55,647
Hey, let go! You
got it all wrong!

694
00:52:55,730 --> 00:52:58,775
By any chance, do
you know who this is?

695
00:52:59,651 --> 00:53:03,696
Was she a patient there or did she have
any personal connection to Director Kim?

696
00:53:06,532 --> 00:53:08,660
No, not at all.

697
00:53:09,243 --> 00:53:11,955
I know all of Director
Kim's connections.

698
00:53:12,872 --> 00:53:13,873
But…

699
00:53:14,415 --> 00:53:17,835
I only know this person
as Candidate Pyo Jaehyun's wife.

700
00:53:28,388 --> 00:53:31,057
Jo Gyutae, why are you here?

701
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:32,392
I mean, why is he…

702
00:53:35,353 --> 00:53:37,730
Tell me I'm wrong! Did Jaehyun...

703
00:53:37,814 --> 00:53:39,732
Damn it! Save me!

704
00:53:40,274 --> 00:53:42,986
I didn't
do anything! Why me?

705
00:53:43,069 --> 00:53:45,405
I said it's not
me! Hey, Jo Gyutae!

706
00:53:46,656 --> 00:53:48,783
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm okay.

707
00:53:49,742 --> 00:53:50,743
I'm fine.

708
00:53:53,371 --> 00:53:54,455
I'm all right.

709
00:54:01,504 --> 00:54:04,215
Slush fund files
from Director Kim's hard drive.

710
00:54:04,757 --> 00:54:06,843
Your name pops up quite a bit.

711
00:54:07,343 --> 00:54:11,389
We have acquired video footage of
your meetings with Director Kim.

712
00:54:19,063 --> 00:54:20,356
Unbelievable.

713
00:54:22,316 --> 00:54:23,776
TARGET

714
00:54:37,373 --> 00:54:40,209
And you were both at the event
on this day.

715
00:54:42,045 --> 00:54:43,504
Let me have my phone call.

716
00:54:44,255 --> 00:54:45,882
I need to call someone.

717
00:54:45,965 --> 00:54:47,383
- Pyo...
- To call your family?

718
00:54:47,467 --> 00:54:49,260
You gave them
foreign currency, no?

719
00:54:50,553 --> 00:54:54,265
Your family, who is in Italy,
will be summoned to Korea.

720
00:54:55,933 --> 00:54:56,934
<i>Ah.</i>

721
00:54:57,018 --> 00:55:00,354
Your wife and your children
are well in Italy, right?

722
00:55:02,607 --> 00:55:03,775
How did you know?

723
00:55:03,858 --> 00:55:05,651
I'm always watching over them.

724
00:55:07,779 --> 00:55:09,489
They're like my
family, after all.

725
00:55:11,699 --> 00:55:13,201
Did he abandon me?

726
00:55:14,077 --> 00:55:15,203
Me?

727
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,294
Don't bother with the theatrics.
It won't work.

728
00:55:30,259 --> 00:55:31,636
Hey, hey!

729
00:55:31,719 --> 00:55:32,720
Hey, why is he…

730
00:55:32,804 --> 00:55:34,263
Hey, is anyone outside?

731
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:49,153
Must've been tough, honey.

732
00:55:50,196 --> 00:55:51,697
It's time to go home now.

733
00:55:54,075 --> 00:55:56,160
- Home?
- It's all over now.

734
00:55:57,370 --> 00:55:59,914
They caught the real killer
of Kim Seondeok.

735
00:56:02,375 --> 00:56:04,877
You'll need to live as Hong
Taera a bit longer.

736
00:56:07,046 --> 00:56:09,507
Mr. Uhm sacrificed
himself to save you.

737
00:56:09,590 --> 00:56:12,051
He died during the
interrogation just now.

738
00:56:12,135 --> 00:56:14,178
He's the enemy who
killed your parents.

739
00:56:15,138 --> 00:56:16,472
Could it be divine justice?

740
00:56:19,433 --> 00:56:21,185
But, still, I feel bad for him.

741
00:56:26,732 --> 00:56:30,736
<i>Uhm, who was arrested
for the murder of Kim Seondeok,</i>

742
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:33,197
<i>has died during the
police interrogation.</i>

743
00:56:33,281 --> 00:56:36,033
<i>The police are trying to
determine the cause of death…</i>

744
00:56:36,117 --> 00:56:40,454
<i>…but it's been revealed Uhm was the chief
secretary of Kumjo Group's chairman,</i>

745
00:56:40,538 --> 00:56:44,167
<i>leading to the suspicion that Kumjo
may also be involved in Hanwoolgate...</i>

746
00:56:47,253 --> 00:56:49,213
You need to handle the press.

747
00:56:49,297 --> 00:56:51,215
Mr. Uhm acted of his own accord.

748
00:56:51,299 --> 00:56:55,094
Our official stance is that his actions
had nothing to do with the company.

749
00:56:55,178 --> 00:56:58,723
We must try our best to prevent
further harm to our company.

750
00:56:59,348 --> 00:57:00,641
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, Chairman.

751
00:57:11,402 --> 00:57:14,947
Pyo Jaehyun, you got yourself
out of a tight spot again.

752
00:57:21,746 --> 00:57:24,207
Hello, Dr. Choi.
How is my father?

753
00:57:26,626 --> 00:57:27,627
Sorry?

754
00:57:28,544 --> 00:57:30,338
What do you mean
he was discharged?

755
00:58:27,895 --> 00:58:29,897
You really want to
live, don't you?

756
00:58:31,983 --> 00:58:33,567
Why are you doing this?

757
00:58:42,118 --> 00:58:44,120
Your speech sounds just fine.

758
00:58:44,203 --> 00:58:45,955
I was afraid you
wouldn't wake up.

759
00:58:50,001 --> 00:58:51,627
Don't worry, and relax.

760
00:58:52,128 --> 00:58:56,007
I don't feel like
killing you yet, Father.

761
01:00:04,492 --> 01:00:07,578
You're home, alive, Taera.
Don't let your guard down.

762
01:00:08,245 --> 01:00:10,748
Pyo Jaehyun saved you
so that he could kill you.

763
01:00:10,831 --> 01:00:12,291
I know.

764
01:00:12,833 --> 01:00:15,795
He'll soon regret
getting rid of Mr. Uhm.

765
01:00:19,048 --> 01:00:20,383
Let's stay strong.

766
01:00:21,175 --> 01:00:23,844
With Mr. Uhm's demise,
he's only one man down.

767
01:00:58,170 --> 01:00:59,755
<i>You will forever be my wife.</i>

768
01:00:59,839 --> 01:01:02,800
Get clever on me again, and
you'll find out who dies next.

769
01:01:02,883 --> 01:01:04,176
That's enough!

770
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:06,804
I decide whether he dies
by starvation or by torture.

771
01:01:06,887 --> 01:01:08,556
We should finalize the divorce.

772
01:01:08,639 --> 01:01:12,852
For the time being, I'm putting a pause
on my campaign to take care of my wife.

773
01:01:13,519 --> 01:01:15,604
<i>There's something here
we can use against him.</i>

774
01:01:15,688 --> 01:01:17,440
<i>Why do you always get in my way?</i>

775
01:01:17,523 --> 01:01:19,442
You hated me.

776
01:01:20,568 --> 01:01:23,112
You saw right through
me from the get-go.

777
01:01:23,195 --> 01:01:25,489
<i>I should look into
Dr. Yang Sejin.</i>

778
01:01:25,573 --> 01:01:28,033
<i>I told you to do nothing.</i>
