EPISODE 1

4
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:17,994
I'm Pyo Jaehyun, the Chairman of Hatch.

5
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:21,081
Today, we're launching
a revolutionary VR medical device

6
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:25,251
called "Clover,"
a neural input smart patch.

7
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:30,382
[audience cheering, applauding]

8
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:34,386
[Dojin] I'm Jang Dojin, the CEO of Hatch.

9
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:37,472
Our research team has created
a VR smart patch,

10
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:41,017
which allows the direct input
of unlearned data into the brain

11
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:44,688
simply by attaching the patch
to the subject.

12
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:50,944
It's the match that you've all been
waiting for: human vs. chimpanzee.

13
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:53,321
Let's begin the survival shooter game.

14
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:58,993
[audience cheering, applauding]

15
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:20,098
Director Koo, can this hyperactive animal
really play the game?

16
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:23,768
Her name is Re--
Wait. This thing is… Oh, shit.

17
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,437
[Dojin laughs]

18
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:27,647
Her name is Red.

19
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:30,692
As a result of five years
of neuro-training,

20
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:34,529
<i>Red has now become a super chimpanzee</i>
<i>with a whopping IQ score of 120.</i>

21
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:37,073
[audience cheering, applauding]

22
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,456
[Dojin] <i>As for the player who will be</i>
<i>the chimpanzee's main opponent,</i>

23
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:45,749
<i>he needs no introduction.</i>

24
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,960
The survival shooter game legend,
Player DK.

25
00:02:56,217 --> 00:03:00,805
Okay, shall we begin?
Let's apply the patch to the chimpanzee.

26
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:04,434
The data of all game-play methods,
strategies,

27
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:07,896
and possible winning odds
are contained within this patch.

28
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:12,442
To be clear,
Red has never played this game before.

29
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:15,862
Shh. Ooh, ooh, ooh.

30
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:18,114

[audience exclaiming]

32
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,045
CHIMPANZEE VS. HUMAN,
WHO WILL WIN?

33
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:33,129
[Jaehyun] <i>The rules are simple.</i>

34
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:38,093
<i>100 players will battle it out,</i>
<i>and the last one standing wins.</i>

35
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:43,932
<i>All 99 players, including DK here,</i>
<i>are all top-ranking players in the game.</i>

36
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,185
Red, however,
has never played this game before.

37
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:48,645
[audience laughs]

38
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,730
DK, give it everything you got.

39
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:53,358
Don't let her off easy
because she's a chimpanzee.

40
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:55,860
That'd be an insult
to the world of sports games.

41
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,114
[Jaehyun] Who will come out on top?

42
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:01,366
Let the games begin.

43
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:03,451
[cheering, applauding]

44
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,217
Let's go, Pyo Jaehyun.

45
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,388
Red, I really hope you win.

Are you all right? I'm so sorry.

51
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:53,460
Watch where you're going.
You almost crashed into me!

52
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,713
I'm really sorry.
Something jumped in front of my car--

53
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:00,383
It was that dog.

You were startled because of a dog?
But it's so adorable.

57
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:33,041
- [passenger] Let's go already.
- [driver] Yes, ma'am. Out of the way.

INCOMING CALL
YURA

62
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:51,726
Hey, Yura.

63
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:55,230
[Yura] Taera, we're in trouble.
Where are you right now?

64
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:59,442
HUMAN VS. CHIMPANZEE,
MATCH OF THE CENTURY

65
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:02,654
[announcer 1] <i>DK, taking the lead.</i>
<i>That lead shot was perfect!</i>

66
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:05,657
He has his opponents on their heels
with his lead shots.

67
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,741
[announcer 2] That's right.

68
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:10,036
He's able to withstand
the recoil while in a moving car.

69
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,540
Plus, he's been able to collect keys
from every opponent so far.

70
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:16,001
[announcer 1] If DK keeps this up,

71
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,545
I reckon this will be
another easy win for him.

72
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:24,884
Oh! Are you seeing this?
Red the chimpanzee's kill log is spiking.

73
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:26,720
- [announcer 2] Yes.
- He's going for the head shots.

74
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,471
Red's kill log is increasing fast.

75
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,932
[announcer 2]
Red isn't one to be taken lightly.

76
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:35,603
[announcer 1] The remaining survivors
are Red the chimpanzee

77
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:38,773
and DK, the world-class gamer.
They're the last two standing.

78
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:42,485
<i>She's swerving to the right.</i>

79
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:45,572
- I don't think DK's seeing this at all.
- [announcer 2] That's right.

80
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:49,159
[announcer 1]
Red has DK in sight from the side!

81
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:52,996
She ends the game with ease
by taking the last head shot.

82
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,749
[both announcers] Cheese!

83
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:56,875
[announcer 1] How can this be?

84
00:06:56,958 --> 00:07:03,089
Red the chimpanzee claims victory against
not one but 99 top-ranking players!

00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,258
[announcer 2 cheers]

86
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:08,595
This victory isn't for Red
but for the Clover smart patch.

87
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:09,888
And a victory for Hatch!

88
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:12,807
Soon, the patch will be yours!

89
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:15,977
[cheering]

90
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:19,064
- We did it!
- I can't believe this was possible.

91
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,440
I know!

92
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:32,077
[Taera] <i>Darling, you were the best today.</i>
<i>See you soon.</i>

93
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:38,917
[Yura] Hey, are you out of your mind?

94
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,794
How dare you use superglue on this!

95
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:46,424
What if it gets on the cloth? Are you
going to pay for all these garments?

96
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:50,762
Couldn't we use it carefully
so it doesn't damage the clothes?

97
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,681
The opening is in less than an hour.

98
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,308
What did the vendor say?

99
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:58,395
Shouldn't they be liable
for shipping damages?

100
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,690
Tell them to get us
whatever mannequins they can! Quick!

101
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:06,277
They said the quickest delivery
will still take over an hour.

102
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:09,406
Miss Hong, shouldn't we just postpone
the opening?

103
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,492
The VIPs will arrive any minute now.
This is driving me nuts!

104
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,578
[Taera]
Losing your temper won't do a thing.

105
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:18,415
- [Yura] Taera!
- Where are the sketches?

106
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,000
Bring over the sketches.

- [worker 1] Oh, no!
- [worker 2] Ms. Hong!

121
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,074
- Call 911!
- Are you okay?

122
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:42,535
- Are you all right?
- Ma'am!

123
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:44,204
Oh, no.

124
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:59,761
Any comments on Hatch's net worth,
due to the success of your smart patch?

125
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:02,806
Our skyrocketing stock price
is proof enough.

126
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:05,266
[reporter] CEO Jang,
you're the second son of Kumjo Group

127
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,519
and now a newly established CEO of Hatch.

128
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:09,896
What are your future research plans?

129
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:13,566
[Dojin] We plan on applying the use
of the smart patch to memory therapy.

130
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:14,651
Why is that?

131
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,987
To treat your wife and former anchorwoman,
Ms. Ko Haesoo's trauma?

132
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:21,282
After witnessing her father's death
15 years ago, I hear she's st--

133
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:23,868
It's these types of questions

134
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:28,832
that will surely hinder
my wife's recovery process, Mr. Park.

135
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:30,625
One more question.

136
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:33,837
Care to comment on the rumors
of a merger with Kumjo Group?

137
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,298
Kumjo Pharmaceuticals is opening
a neuroscience research center, no?

138
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,970
Hatch and Kumjo have been keeping
a healthy distance,

139
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:44,014
enough for both to expand accordingly.

140
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:46,641
We've never even considered a merger.

141
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:49,144
Skip the baseless rumors,
if you're a respectable reporter.

142
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:54,524
Corporate social responsibility
is CEO Jang's top priority.

143
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,735
I have much to learn from him.

144
00:12:56,818 --> 00:13:01,614
To honor a purpose such as his,
I wish to make contributions myself

145
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:05,326
and offer free services
through my health care nonprofit.

146
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:08,705
[reporter 2] Could this mean
that you may be running for president?

147
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,458
Didn't the Korea Democratic Party
offer you a seat?

148
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:16,087
Recently, the owner of my favorite
steakhouse said he wanted to hire me.

149
00:13:16,171 --> 00:13:18,381
He told me I roast meat artfully.

150
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:21,176
I am always quite the coveted talent.
[chuckles]

151
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:25,347
Hatch will soon launch smart patches
compatible with the human body.

152
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,766
Look forward to that. Good day.

153
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,935
- Do you really plan to run for president?
- Mr. Pyo!

154
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:39,069
[doctor] It's a total hit.
Red is all the rage on social media.

155
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,029
[Koo] Is that so?

156
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:45,450
Dr. Yang, you've been with us
since the early stages of the research.

157
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:48,286
And you even suggested the name "Red."

158
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:52,082
Out of everyone here, besides me,
you were the third-most hard-working.

159
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,125
All I did was help you out, Director.

160
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:57,170
So can we get started on human trials
for the patches?

161
00:13:57,253 --> 00:14:01,132
Don't get your hopes up.
We still need to observe Red's condition.

162
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:04,761
Run thorough exams on her optic nerves
and brain wave patterns.

163
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:08,223
Don't worry too much.
There won't be any side effects.

164
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,233
DARLING, YOU WERE THE BEST TODAY.
SEE YOU SOON. - TAERA

165
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:22,278
Why didn't you tell me?

166
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,032
Look at you, bastard.
All grown up now, huh?

167
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:28,034
You dare consider running
without telling me?

168
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:29,703
Okay, I surrender! Ow!

169
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:35,166
Isn't Han Kyungrok the party leader?

170
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,626
When did you get the offer?

171
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,379
A couple days ago.
Hey, you've gotten stronger.

172
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:42,590
I've always been stronger than you.
[chuckles]

173
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:46,594
But, anyway,
you really going to run for president?

174
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:48,138
What about our company?

175
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:52,267
I'll only be gone for a while.
Five years isn't that long.

176
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:55,353
Wow, you've already decided to run, huh?

177
00:14:57,147 --> 00:15:00,191
How would you reckon I'd do,
if I ran for president?

Be careful with that reporter.

180
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,825
He may be your wife's friend,
but he isn't ours.

181
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:12,537
Let's go. Let's prep for the party
since our wives are too busy.

182

What's your diagnosis, Dr. Kang?

186
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:38,355
The memory circuit's been stimulated.
Her memories will recover over time.

187
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,732
I expect no slipups.

188
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:43,401
No. And I suggest you stop her medications

189
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:46,279
to help with the memory recovery.

190
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:49,783
Thank you, Doctor.

191
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:54,579

Are you awake?
Do you remember what happened?

195
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:35,578
Does your head hurt?

[sighs, breathing heavily]

197
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:42,293
- I'm okay.
- What do you mean you're okay?

198
00:16:42,377 --> 00:16:43,586
You fainted.

199
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:47,340
You're lucky the chandelier didn't land
on you. You could've been injured badly.

200
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,594
Wait, Yura.

201
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:54,222
I had a weird dream.

202
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:56,016
A dream?

203
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:58,768
This girl was fighting with someone.

204
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:02,063
I think the girl was me,

205
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:04,858
but I'm not so sure.

206
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:11,406
What did you see exactly?
Have you remembered something?

207
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:15,118
[sighs] I don't know what it was exactly.

208

[sighs]

209
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:21,166
It's already been 15 years
since the accident.

210
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:23,293
Why haven't your memories recovered?

211
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:28,673
Maybe they're starting to come back to me.

212
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:33,178
Maybe I should've just hit my head
even harder.

213
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:35,138
[chuckles]

214
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:38,892
You little brat, I'm worried sick
about you, and you're laughing?

215
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:43,021
[gasps] Oh, right.
Did you see Jaehyun's presentation?

216
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:45,648
Of course I did.
It's taken the world by storm.

217
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:49,819
I think your husband's getting
a little too popular.

218
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:54,532
Exactly. He's getting so popular,
I'm starting to feel inferior now.

219
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:56,284
Why do you have to feel inferior?

220
00:17:56,368 --> 00:18:00,163
It's all thanks to you
that he's doing so well.

[gasps] Ah.

223
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:06,044
It's late. I need to go home.

224
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:08,672
You sure you'll be okay?
You should stay the night.

225
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:12,050
I said I'm fine.
You just go back to the boutique.

226
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:15,970
The CEO should be at the opening.
You're coming to the party though, right?

227
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:20,308
Of course.
There's someone I'd like to see.

228
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:23,853
Jiu's been telling me
how much she misses you.

229
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:27,148
How do I get this off?
Can you get someone to help me with this?

230
00:18:27,232 --> 00:18:28,608
Okay.

Aw, Dad bought that for me today.

243
00:20:31,773 --> 00:20:34,609
Didn't Mommy tell you
not to aim at people?

244
00:20:34,693 --> 00:20:36,277
From now on, toy guns are off-limits.

245
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:40,281
I'm sorry. I'll never aim at you again.

246
00:20:40,365 --> 00:20:44,869
I'll never aim at others either.
I mean it, Mom. Pinkie promise.

247
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:50,792
You know you have to keep your promises,
no matter what, right?

248
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:55,880
Now, where's that dad of yours
who bought you this?

There you are.

Yeah, so many.

Damn, you're corny.

255
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,575
Shall we show them what we're about?

256
00:21:23,658 --> 00:21:24,659
Damn it.

257
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:26,411
Geez.

258
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:32,042
Wow, South Korea's cream of the crop,
all gathered here in one place.

259
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:35,670
Do I really live
at the same townhouse as they do?

260
00:21:35,754 --> 00:21:38,089
Oh, I guess I made it.

261
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:44,137
Taera, I think you might have
to change your name to "Pyo Jaehyun."

[both laugh]

Is that a compliment?

No, Sungchan's not one
to compliment people. [laughs]

265
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:53,480
So was that an insult?
I thought Sungchan liked me.

266
00:21:54,022 --> 00:21:56,191
He's saying you're shameless. [chuckles]

267

Oh, I see.

268
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:02,947
You mean the way you broke our promise
and bought Jiu a toy gun again?

269
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:06,701
Guys, isn't it time for the evening news?

270
00:22:06,785 --> 00:22:09,704
She hates reading
and wants to play all day.

271
00:22:09,788 --> 00:22:11,623
What if she ranks last at school?

272
00:22:11,706 --> 00:22:14,084
Is that so bad?
Someone has to rank last anyway.

273
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:17,337
[Taera sighs] Don't blame me
if she gets bad grades.

274
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,047
Were you last in your class?

275
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:23,343
Wow. I was always ranked first.
I always wondered what that felt like.

276
00:22:23,426 --> 00:22:25,679
Is that… embarrassing?

277
00:22:32,811 --> 00:22:34,062
Where's Jiu?

278
00:22:34,145 --> 00:22:35,689
She's playing with her tutor.

279
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:37,899
She was sad Leo went to his grandmother's.

280

Oh, he's spending the night there.

00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:00,231
Ow, what?

311
00:24:00,315 --> 00:24:01,316
- The mic!
- The mic?

312
00:24:08,907 --> 00:24:10,408
Next up.

313
00:24:10,492 --> 00:24:15,038
Both major parties are on edge as they
gear up for presidential nominations.

314
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:16,998
Candidacy registrations next week

315
00:24:17,082 --> 00:24:20,627
will officially mark the start
of the 29th presidential elections.

316
00:24:21,252 --> 00:24:24,339
I thought I made it clear
I wouldn't be joining the party.

317
00:24:24,422 --> 00:24:27,008
[person]
<i>You could always change your mind, no?</i>

318
00:24:27,092 --> 00:24:30,095
<i>Or have you already spoken to someone</i>
<i>from another party?</i>

319
00:24:30,637 --> 00:24:31,638
No, I haven't.

320
00:24:32,931 --> 00:24:37,394
Mr. Han, I take it that you're the source
of that reporter earlier.

321
00:24:38,061 --> 00:24:39,437
I was a bit flabbergasted.

322
00:24:39,521 --> 00:24:41,940
Let's turn over a new leaf.

323
00:24:42,023 --> 00:24:44,901
The public wants a figure like you,

324
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:47,862
and it's about time
you take a step into politics.

325
00:24:47,946 --> 00:24:51,574
Do I have to choose a political side
to turn over a new leaf?

326
00:24:52,492 --> 00:24:54,327
I'm better off alone, you know.

327
00:24:54,911 --> 00:24:58,415
Don't tell me you're thinking of running
as an independent candidate?

328
00:24:58,498 --> 00:25:02,669
That's not how politics works.
You can never succeed alone, you fool.

329
00:25:02,752 --> 00:25:05,672
My friends are waiting.
I should get going now.

330
00:25:05,755 --> 00:25:07,841
Oh, right. I'm rooting for you, sir.

331
00:25:07,924 --> 00:25:10,343
Wait, Chairman Pyo! Pyo--

332
00:25:13,596 --> 00:25:18,476
[sighs] He's young and full of passion,
so he can't see the big picture.

333
00:25:19,352 --> 00:25:20,729
He was raised by a single mother?

334
00:25:20,812 --> 00:25:23,940
She was a doctor at a small clinic
in Samcheok.

335
00:25:24,024 --> 00:25:27,485
The country bumpkin is blinded
by his own success.

336
00:25:29,946 --> 00:25:33,033
Rumor has it that the smart patch
is just a red herring

337
00:25:33,116 --> 00:25:36,161
and they've actually inserted a chip
into the chimpanzee's brain.

338
00:25:37,912 --> 00:25:40,248
It may be dangerous
if we make the wrong move.

339
00:25:40,331 --> 00:25:43,835
Public opinion is quite favorable
toward Chairman Pyo right now.

340
00:25:43,918 --> 00:25:46,504
He's a trump card,
which means he could be a threat.

341
00:25:46,588 --> 00:25:49,424
If he's a card we can't get,
we have to destroy him!

342
00:25:51,885 --> 00:25:52,886
[sighs]

343
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:57,974
Any way we can find out quietly?

344
00:26:01,603 --> 00:26:02,979
- Where's Sungchan?
- Oh, him?

345
00:26:03,063 --> 00:26:05,482
He's speaking to Dr. Yang
about Red's condition.

346
00:26:05,565 --> 00:26:08,443
Hey, that bastard might even adopt
the animal.

347
00:26:09,652 --> 00:26:12,864
I'll go get some wine.
I've been saving it up for today.

348
00:26:12,947 --> 00:26:13,948
- Okay.
- All right.

349
00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:18,620
It's getting chilly.
Shall I burn some firewood?

350
00:26:18,703 --> 00:26:19,871
Sure.

351
00:26:19,954 --> 00:26:22,665
- When's Yura arriving?
- She's not picking up.

352
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:30,840
[whispers] Let's see.

353
00:26:34,594 --> 00:26:36,554
[sighs]

354
00:26:36,638 --> 00:26:39,140
- [shouts]
- [gasps, grunts]

355
00:26:39,224 --> 00:26:40,600
[chuckles]

356
00:26:40,684 --> 00:26:42,102
Did I scare you?

357
00:26:44,104 --> 00:26:46,272
- This wine is my favorite.
- Hey.

358
00:26:46,356 --> 00:26:49,109
How the hell did you get in?
What if Haesoo comes?

359
00:26:50,485 --> 00:26:52,028
You said she'd be late.

360
00:28:05,643 --> 00:28:07,312
TO: KO HAESOO
FROM: KO TAESUN

361
00:28:20,325 --> 00:28:21,493
Haesoo.

362
00:28:21,576 --> 00:28:24,829
I heard the meeting's been canceled.
Shall we go grab some drinks?

363
00:28:24,913 --> 00:28:26,831
Go to my house. They're having a party.

364
00:28:26,915 --> 00:28:30,877
Your husband might kill me.
He was really upset earlier.

365
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,254
Did he have to get so upset about that?

366
00:28:33,338 --> 00:28:35,006
Why did you even mention me?

367
00:28:36,341 --> 00:28:40,720
I just wanted to know what he's thinking
and how much he loves you.

368
00:28:41,513 --> 00:28:42,514
[scoffs]

369
00:28:42,597 --> 00:28:43,848
[delivery person] Ms. Ko!

370
00:28:45,934 --> 00:28:47,769
This came for you.

371
00:28:47,852 --> 00:28:51,106
[Park] Is it from a fan?
I guess Ko Haesoo's still got it.

372
00:28:51,898 --> 00:28:53,566
TO: KO HAESOO
FROM: KO TAESUN

373
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:54,651
Ko Taesun?

374
00:28:55,402 --> 00:28:57,404
What kind of bastard is playing pranks?

375
00:28:57,487 --> 00:28:58,530
Who brought this?

376
00:28:58,613 --> 00:29:02,117
Express delivery. He was wearing
a helmet, so I couldn't see his face.

377
00:29:03,201 --> 00:29:05,453
[Park sighs]
I thought the pranks were over.

378
00:29:05,537 --> 00:29:07,497
We'll find out
which delivery service it was.

379
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,665
Let's go.

380
00:29:30,395 --> 00:29:32,313
THEY CALLED HER NO. 50.
KO TAESUN'S REAL KILLER.

381
00:29:32,397 --> 00:29:34,107
TO FIND HER,
COME TO HANWOOL MENTAL HOSPITAL.

382
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:36,067
- [gunshot]
- [people screaming]

383
00:29:36,776 --> 00:29:38,862
Dad!

384
00:29:41,865 --> 00:29:42,991
[Haesoo] <i>No. 50?</i>

385
00:29:43,658 --> 00:29:45,994
<i>She's the one who killed my dad?</i>

386
00:29:59,507 --> 00:30:02,385
<i>Find out everything you can</i>
<i>about Hanwool Mental Hospital.</i>

387
00:30:08,391 --> 00:30:09,601
You're early.

388
00:30:10,226 --> 00:30:12,645
It's already viral,
Ko Haesoo's street style.

389
00:30:13,396 --> 00:30:15,106
They're all in awe of your beauty.

390
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:18,651
It's all thanks to your exquisite taste,
Ms. Hong Taera.

391
00:30:18,735 --> 00:30:19,819
I truly appreciate it.

392
00:30:19,903 --> 00:30:20,945
[both laugh]

393
00:30:21,029 --> 00:30:22,697
Is that what you wanted to hear?

394
00:30:22,781 --> 00:30:23,948
Yes.

395
00:30:24,032 --> 00:30:26,076
You know I love fishing for compliments.

396
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:27,660
[both chuckle]

397
00:30:27,744 --> 00:30:29,871
- I heard Leo's at his grandmother's.
- Yeah.

398
00:30:30,872 --> 00:30:31,873
What's this?

399
00:30:38,004 --> 00:30:40,298
- Taera!
- [giggles]

400
00:30:40,382 --> 00:30:41,925
Have a romantic night.

401
00:30:42,008 --> 00:30:45,679
Oh, your husband went to get wine,
but he must've fallen asleep.

402
00:30:45,762 --> 00:30:46,930
Bring him with you.

403
00:30:58,900 --> 00:30:59,901
[gasps]

404
00:31:01,611 --> 00:31:02,612
Dojin!

405
00:31:04,906 --> 00:31:06,449
Dojin, where are you?

406
00:31:07,492 --> 00:31:09,160
[water running]

407
00:31:28,096 --> 00:31:29,347
Are you in the shower?

408
00:31:31,725 --> 00:31:33,977
Yeah, I'll be right out!

409
00:31:36,354 --> 00:31:38,690
[breathing heavily]

410
00:31:47,615 --> 00:31:49,492
Careful on your way out. Don't get caught.

411
00:32:02,756 --> 00:32:05,258
There was a broken bottle.
Did you take a shower?

412
00:32:05,842 --> 00:32:08,845
I thought you were running late
because of a meeting.

413
00:32:10,221 --> 00:32:12,223
Oh, it was canceled.

414
00:32:12,932 --> 00:32:14,476
You should get changed.

415
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:08,697
Did you drink a lot? Your face is red.

416
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,073
Oh, is it?

417
00:33:10,824 --> 00:33:13,368
Maybe it's because I'm tired.

418
00:33:13,451 --> 00:33:14,786
I do feel a bit drunk.

419
00:33:39,894 --> 00:33:41,980
[sighs] Shall we get going?

420
00:33:42,063 --> 00:33:43,773
Let me just wash my hands.

421
00:33:52,615 --> 00:33:53,616
[sighs]

422
00:34:18,516 --> 00:34:20,852
[Dojin] Let's go!
Everyone's waiting for us!

423
00:34:29,611 --> 00:34:31,321
Cheers!

424
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,490
[Taera] Why were you so late?

425
00:34:33,573 --> 00:34:35,909
Sorry, I was busy with the opening.

426
00:34:35,992 --> 00:34:38,370
[Taera]
You can't be married to work forever.

427
00:34:38,453 --> 00:34:40,789
Can you guys introduce her
to eligible bachelors?

428
00:34:40,872 --> 00:34:42,791
She's such an amazing woman.

429
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:46,628
Taera, I'm actually seeing someone.

430
00:34:46,711 --> 00:34:49,964
[Taera gasps] Really? Since when?

431
00:34:50,048 --> 00:34:51,800
What does he do?

432
00:34:51,883 --> 00:34:53,802
How come you didn't tell me?

433
00:34:53,885 --> 00:34:56,721
Calm down. You'll find out
when the time's right.

434
00:35:02,018 --> 00:35:05,146
By the way, are you okay?
Be mindful of your condition tonight.

435
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,523
It's your head, after all.

436
00:35:06,606 --> 00:35:09,150
You hurt your head? How? What happened?

437
00:35:09,234 --> 00:35:11,903
I fell at the boutique. It's nothing.

438
00:35:11,986 --> 00:35:13,822
[Jaehyun] Why didn't you tell me?

439
00:35:13,905 --> 00:35:16,408
Did you see a doctor?
You need to be hospitalized?

440
00:35:16,491 --> 00:35:18,952
It's not that serious.
They said I was fine.

441
00:35:19,035 --> 00:35:20,954
Even Dr. Kang said I'm fine.

442
00:35:21,037 --> 00:35:24,290
I'm sorry, Jaehyun.
I give her too much work.

443
00:35:24,791 --> 00:35:27,836
Why don't you have another child, a son?

444
00:35:27,919 --> 00:35:30,463
The world needs genes like yours.

445
00:35:31,256 --> 00:35:32,549
Don't you agree, Haesoo?

446
00:35:37,262 --> 00:35:40,348
- Haesoo?
- Why are you so deep in thought?

447
00:35:49,024 --> 00:35:50,400
Did someone come over earlier?

448
00:35:53,403 --> 00:35:55,947
[sighs] Who would come over?

449
00:35:56,031 --> 00:35:58,825
I heard you took a little too long
to get wine.

450
00:36:02,704 --> 00:36:04,664
Something on the reporter's radar again?

451
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:06,416
Huh?

452
00:36:06,499 --> 00:36:09,336
Just ask me directly
and stop beating around the bush.

453
00:36:11,004 --> 00:36:13,423
Stop overreacting.
It's even more suspicious.

454
00:36:13,506 --> 00:36:14,549
That's enough!

455
00:36:18,428 --> 00:36:20,138
So embarrassing in front of everyone…

456
00:36:25,268 --> 00:36:27,687
What's wrong, Haesoo?
Did something happen?

457
00:36:29,147 --> 00:36:30,190
It's nothing, Taera.

458
00:36:31,149 --> 00:36:34,027
I'm sorry. I've ruined the mood.

459
00:36:34,903 --> 00:36:38,865
Haesoo, I think you're being too nice.

460
00:36:38,948 --> 00:36:42,035
Go after him
and teach that bastard a lesson.

461
00:36:43,578 --> 00:36:44,788
Let's drink.

462
00:36:44,871 --> 00:36:45,872
[Jaehyun] Mmm.

463
00:36:46,414 --> 00:36:47,415
All right.

464
00:36:47,499 --> 00:36:49,376
[glasses clinking]

465
00:36:49,459 --> 00:36:51,961
- [Jiu] Auntie!
- [Yura] Yeah?

466
00:36:52,045 --> 00:36:53,296
Please sleep over!

467
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:55,173
[Yura] I can't today.

468
00:36:55,256 --> 00:36:56,508
I'll sleep over next time.

469
00:36:56,591 --> 00:36:58,176
- Promise.
- Promise.

470
00:36:58,259 --> 00:37:00,428
Mmm. Kisses.

471
00:37:00,512 --> 00:37:01,763
You cutie.

472
00:37:02,263 --> 00:37:03,306
Bye.

473
00:37:04,974 --> 00:37:07,060
Bring your boyfriend next time.

474
00:37:07,143 --> 00:37:08,311
Let's go.

475
00:37:13,566 --> 00:37:16,736
Do you have a better recollection
of your dream from earlier?

476
00:37:17,779 --> 00:37:18,947
No.

477
00:37:21,491 --> 00:37:23,743
If your head hurts again,
just give me a call.

478
00:37:23,827 --> 00:37:25,078
I'll come right over.

479
00:37:25,662 --> 00:37:27,580
Okay. Thanks, Yura.

480
00:37:27,664 --> 00:37:31,084
By the way, Dr. Kang said
you can stop taking your meds now.

481
00:37:31,167 --> 00:37:34,254
He says it's not good
to take psych meds for too long.

482
00:37:37,173 --> 00:37:38,174
This is for you.

483
00:37:40,051 --> 00:37:41,094
What's this?

484
00:37:41,177 --> 00:37:43,138
To celebrate the opening of your boutique.

485
00:37:44,723 --> 00:37:45,724
You like it?

486
00:37:45,807 --> 00:37:47,684
It's sophisticated and not too basic.

487
00:37:49,144 --> 00:37:50,395
It's beautiful.

488
00:37:50,478 --> 00:37:52,063
I am your little sister,

489
00:37:52,147 --> 00:37:55,692
but I lost my memory
and spent a year at the hospital.

490
00:37:57,277 --> 00:37:59,112
I would've run off by now.

491
00:38:03,033 --> 00:38:06,286
The happiness I enjoy now
is all thanks to you.

492
00:38:06,995 --> 00:38:07,996
I'm so grateful.

493
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:09,622
Always so dramatic.

494
00:38:10,874 --> 00:38:12,000
I'm gonna go.

495
00:38:12,083 --> 00:38:14,294
I hope your memories
come back to you soon.

496
00:38:15,295 --> 00:38:18,173
So who's the guy you've been seeing?

497
00:38:19,382 --> 00:38:20,550
Someone I know?

498
00:38:29,934 --> 00:38:32,812
You enjoy making a fool of your husband
in front of everyone?

499
00:38:32,896 --> 00:38:36,024
What matters to me is the truth,
so don't keep any secrets from me.

500
00:38:36,107 --> 00:38:38,026
So what the hell is up with Mr. Park?

501
00:38:39,527 --> 00:38:41,613
- [sighs]
- What?

502
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,115
Why'd he mention you
in front of the press?

503
00:38:46,117 --> 00:38:47,827
Bastard has feelings for you, huh?

504
00:38:47,911 --> 00:38:49,871
I know he did it to piss me off.

505
00:38:49,954 --> 00:38:52,999
It was out of pure curiosity.
Why are you so upset?

506
00:38:53,083 --> 00:38:57,295
The entire nation knows about the tragedy
I endured. Not exactly a scoop, is it?

507
00:38:57,379 --> 00:39:00,757
So why the hell is he bringing it up again
when it's all in the past?

508
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,841
In the past?

509
00:39:03,134 --> 00:39:04,386
How's that all in the past?

510
00:39:05,845 --> 00:39:07,347
The suspect is still at large.

511
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:09,683
They're still alive, watching me.

512
00:39:09,766 --> 00:39:11,226
How is that in the past?

513
00:39:11,976 --> 00:39:14,187
Why do you have to be so heartless?

514
00:39:16,147 --> 00:39:17,691
I'm actually grateful.

515
00:39:17,774 --> 00:39:22,195
Thanks to Mr. Park, the suspect
must've felt guilty, even for a second.

516
00:39:24,364 --> 00:39:25,824
I've told you

517
00:39:25,907 --> 00:39:29,703
that I'll be the one to report
my own story with my own words

518
00:39:29,786 --> 00:39:31,413
when the culprit is captured.

519
00:39:32,455 --> 00:39:35,792
[sighs] So,
you're not grateful for me, huh?

520
00:39:35,875 --> 00:39:39,546
I'm the one who stayed by your side
ever since that incident.

521
00:39:39,629 --> 00:39:42,048
I did my best for you too.

522
00:39:42,132 --> 00:39:44,718
Do you know how cheap it feels
to say this myself?

523
00:39:46,553 --> 00:39:47,554
[sighs]

524
00:40:23,965 --> 00:40:25,675
Where's she going at this hour?

525
00:40:52,911 --> 00:40:54,245

[exhales sharply]

529
00:41:32,534 --> 00:41:34,953
If you hadn't come tonight,
I might've died.

530
00:41:37,163 --> 00:41:38,790
I missed you so much.

531
00:43:07,796 --> 00:43:08,922
[Jaehyun] This song.

532
00:43:09,964 --> 00:43:13,385
You said it was your mother's favorite.
It's grown on me.

533
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:17,889
[Jaehyun] Whenever she had a glass
of wine, she would dance to this song.

534
00:43:18,473 --> 00:43:20,809
[Taera] Your mother was so beautiful.

535
00:43:20,892 --> 00:43:23,436
It would've been nice
if she were still alive.

536
00:43:30,527 --> 00:43:34,447
Do you remember what you told me
on our first date?

537
00:43:34,531 --> 00:43:37,742
"You'll remember this afternoon
for the rest of your life,

538
00:43:37,826 --> 00:43:40,328
even if you forget my face and name."

539
00:43:40,412 --> 00:43:41,788
It's a line from a movie.

540
00:43:43,289 --> 00:43:44,332
I feel like

541
00:43:45,125 --> 00:43:47,085
that line was meant for me.

542
00:43:47,711 --> 00:43:50,672
Weren't you afraid of a girl
who'd lost all her memories?

543
00:43:50,755 --> 00:43:51,756
Not at all.

544
00:43:52,382 --> 00:43:55,343
All I thought about was
how much I didn't want to leave.

545
00:43:57,345 --> 00:43:58,596
The next day

546
00:43:59,139 --> 00:44:02,642
and the day after that,
I wanted to stay with you, Hong Taera.

547
00:44:07,522 --> 00:44:10,942
Despite who I might've been in the past?

548
00:44:12,444 --> 00:44:14,988
I would've loved you,
no matter who you were.

549
00:44:15,822 --> 00:44:19,242
And I will continue to do so
for the rest of my life.

550
00:44:21,911 --> 00:44:24,205
[chuckles] It almost sounds fake.

551
00:44:24,789 --> 00:44:26,082
What does?

552
00:44:26,166 --> 00:44:27,459
What you just said.

553
00:44:28,668 --> 00:44:30,712
It's too sweet and lovely.

554
00:44:31,463 --> 00:44:32,589
It feels unrealistic.

555
00:44:32,672 --> 00:44:33,882
[Jaehyun sighs]

556
00:44:35,091 --> 00:44:37,093
I love you so much.

557
00:44:38,178 --> 00:44:41,056
I'm going to love no one else
until my last breath.

558
00:44:41,139 --> 00:44:43,391
No matter what you do,

559
00:44:43,475 --> 00:44:45,977
I'm going to trust you and follow you

560
00:44:46,811 --> 00:44:48,646
and stay by your side forever.

561
00:44:51,107 --> 00:44:52,442

[Taera] No, Haesoo!
Haesoo, come to your senses!

Let go of this!

Let go, Haesoo. Everything's fine.

You're okay, Haesoo.

Some lunatic bashed her head in.

What else do I have left to do?

625
00:51:27,087 --> 00:51:30,090
It is a mother's duty
to give such devotion to her children.

I will also lift a prayer for your sons

00:51:37,722 --> 00:51:39,974
Buddha looks very cold.

628
00:51:40,684 --> 00:51:45,897
If you'd like him to stay warm
this winter, there's much to do.

629
00:51:46,648 --> 00:51:49,526
May Buddha's protection be with you.

<i>It's a fake delivery service.</i>

631
00:52:13,675 --> 00:52:15,468
<i>I can't even run the license plate.</i>

632
00:52:16,302 --> 00:52:17,429
And his phone number?

633
00:52:17,512 --> 00:52:19,055
<i>It's obviously unregistered.</i>

634
00:52:19,139 --> 00:52:21,891
The reward for your father's case
is 1 billion won.

635
00:52:22,726 --> 00:52:26,104
<i>If money was their objective,</i>
<i>they would've left their name.</i>

636
00:52:29,774 --> 00:52:32,318
They're telling me to find out for myself.

637
00:52:35,989 --> 00:52:38,199
Did you look into Hanwool Mental Hospital?

HANWOOL MENTAL HOSPITAL

<i>The director is quite influential.</i>
<i>Runs a lot of social organizations.</i>

<i>My journalistic senses are tingling.</i>

647
00:53:02,057 --> 00:53:04,184
Okay, talk to you soon.
[in English] Thank you.

648
00:53:05,185 --> 00:53:07,020
[in Korean] You feeling better?

649
00:53:07,103 --> 00:53:08,188
Hey, Taera.

650
00:53:09,356 --> 00:53:11,024
Why are you looking into Hanwool?

651
00:53:12,692 --> 00:53:14,110
Do you know this place?

652
00:53:15,779 --> 00:53:17,864
I need to check this place out right now.

653
00:53:17,947 --> 00:53:19,491
Why all of a sudden?

654
00:53:20,909 --> 00:53:22,786
Can you keep a secret?

655
00:53:26,414 --> 00:53:28,333
Someone sent me this picture,

656
00:53:28,416 --> 00:53:33,129
saying she's my dad's real killer
and to come to the hospital to find her.

657
00:53:42,555 --> 00:53:44,140
Who sent you this?

658
00:53:44,641 --> 00:53:45,642
I don't know.

659
00:53:45,725 --> 00:53:47,185
It was an express delivery,

660
00:53:48,019 --> 00:53:51,022
and the delivery man's helmet
had a skull design on it.

661
00:53:59,948 --> 00:54:00,949
I'll go with you.

662
00:54:11,751 --> 00:54:15,380
[person gasps] That's Ko Haesoo.
Wow, she's so much prettier in person.

663
00:54:15,463 --> 00:54:16,923
Oh, wow.

664
00:54:17,424 --> 00:54:18,508
Come on.

665
00:54:38,278 --> 00:54:41,489
[worker gasps]
Wow, aren't you the anchor, Ko Haesoo?

666
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:45,035
Yes, hello.

667
00:54:45,118 --> 00:54:49,998
You're so much prettier in person.
But what brings you here?

668
00:54:50,874 --> 00:54:52,917
I'm looking for someone.

669
00:54:56,421 --> 00:54:57,881
Her name is "No. 50."

670
00:54:58,465 --> 00:55:00,925
It looks like
a part of her ear is severed.

671
00:55:01,009 --> 00:55:02,469
Is she a patient here?

672
00:55:02,552 --> 00:55:04,262
I'm not sure.

673
00:55:04,346 --> 00:55:07,390
She could be a patient or staffer here.

674
00:55:07,474 --> 00:55:09,893
Could you check your records?

675
00:55:42,008 --> 00:55:45,929
[worker] <i>Records from 15 years ago</i>
<i>are no longer in our system.</i>

676
00:55:46,012 --> 00:55:48,640
We can't share
personal medical records either.

677
00:55:50,308 --> 00:55:53,436
[sighs] This pertains
to an important case. I have to find her.

678
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:57,649
Or maybe I can meet someone
who worked here at the time.

679
00:56:00,527 --> 00:56:02,529
I have an official media request form.

680
00:56:02,612 --> 00:56:05,740
We're sorry, but we can't do anything
about hospital regulations.

681
00:56:05,824 --> 00:56:08,660
Could you just do a simple check? Please.

682
00:56:08,743 --> 00:56:10,120
[person] What's this about?

683
00:56:21,548 --> 00:56:23,717
I'm Jo Gyutae, the general manager here.

684
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:26,261
I'm looking for someone called "50."

685
00:56:27,971 --> 00:56:28,972
Who?

686
00:56:30,473 --> 00:56:32,017
[Haesoo] I received a tip-off.

687
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:34,978
She has something to do with
my father's murder case.

688
00:56:36,521 --> 00:56:37,897
Your father?

689
00:56:38,481 --> 00:56:41,109
The former president Ko Taesun.

Who?

Something's definitely off.

Where do you think you're going?
