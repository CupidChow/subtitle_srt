PANDORA: BENEATH THE PARADISE

2
00:00:55,686 --> 00:00:58,130
EPISODE 7

3
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:02,979
[Seondeok] The night of Hong Yura's death,

4
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:06,066
what were you doing at the dock
near the lake, Mr. Pyo,

5
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:08,777
wearing a black raincoat?

6
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:23,416
Looks like you're willing to talk,
judging by the look on your face.

7
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:28,213
Hatch is currently worth
over 20 trillion won.

8
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:34,552
Why don't you hand Hatch over to me?

9
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:39,057
Hand Hatch over…

10
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,435
to you?

11
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:45,021
You'll need to set up
a blind trust for your stocks

12
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,982
before you enter the Blue House anyway.

13
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:51,111
What if I were the independent trustee?

14
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:54,280
A presidential term is fleeting, you know.

15
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:57,450
I'll return half of it to you
upon your return to civilian life.

16
00:01:58,076 --> 00:01:59,369
How does that sound?

17
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,005
You were painting a bigger picture
than I'd assumed.

18
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:12,882
[Seondeok laughs]

19
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:16,636
Well, I'll admit,
you're a masterful artist yourself.

20
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,890
Greasing Uhm's fist to get him to make it
seem like Chairman Jang is behind it all.

21
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,393
Now that's a masterpiece.

22
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:26,563
Clearly, you're no ordinary man.

23
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:30,734
You almost had me fooled, sir.

24
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:34,779
I'm afraid I don't know what you mean.

25
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:39,743
I suppose you leave me no choice
but to speak about your wife.

26
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:42,746
Hong Taera.

27
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:48,376
I personally prefer calling her No. 50.

28
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:55,675
No. 50 is the assassin that Ko Haesoo
is madly intent on finding, no?

29
00:02:55,759 --> 00:03:00,305
And the man who turned No. 50
into Hong Taera was you, yes?

30
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:08,063
I gather you got rid of Hong Yura
because she found out the truth.

31
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:11,566
At last, the puzzle has been solved.

32
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,527
I suppose this very meeting we're having

33
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:19,491
was probably a part of the plan,
wasn't it?

34
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:27,082
Is Taera aware
of the things you're saying to me?

35
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:38,760
Why would I run my mouth
without my partner's consent?

36
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:43,390
[sighs]

37
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:47,185
Whatever you're planning,
I want to be a part of it,

38
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:49,604
as an official partner of yours.

39
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:54,776
Pinning everything on Chairman Jang
to take over Kumjo,

40
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:57,821
becoming the president
to take over this country,

41
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,906
I'm all for it.

42
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:02,117
[Seondeok laughs]

43
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:07,288
But, first,
why don't you give Mr. Jo back to me?

44
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:12,419
You wasted your time with a stray
because I'd let my boy loose.

45
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:17,507
I'll make sure this never happens again.

46
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,342
Your turn to show your cards.

47
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,053
Who did you plant to keep tabs on me?

48
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,142
Who's the brave soul
who dared to tread on my turf…

49
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:30,854
and take these photos of me?

50
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:37,152
[No. 105 screams]

51
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:40,321
It's time you give up on Haesoo.

52
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,781
Over my dead body.

53
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:46,745
[No. 105 grunting]

54
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:58,506
[No. 50 gasps]

55
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:09,684
It was you?

56
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:13,146
[No. 105 breathes shakily]

57

[No. 50 gasps]

61
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:47,889
Mr. Park?

62
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,443
[Haesoo screams]

63
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:10,578
She must be here. Search thoroughly!

64
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:11,955
[bodyguards] Yes, sir!

65
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,540
[footsteps]

66
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:24,259
[Dojin] Haesoo! Ko Haesoo!

67
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:29,723
Haesoo!

68
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,892
- Ko Haesoo!
- [Haesoo] Dojin, over here!

69
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:40,066
We need to get him to a hospital.

70
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:56,207
HANWOOL MENTAL HOSPITAL

71
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,376
[Seondeok humming]

[Seondeok grunts]

73
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:13,099
Why didn't you tell me Hajun was alive?

74
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:16,936
You wanted to see how long
it would take me to recognize him?

75
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,480
Were you amused?

76
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:27,572
Mother Director, are you okay?

77
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:31,076
Mother Director?

78
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:39,167
No. 105 was only supposed to scare you,
but it seems he slipped up this time.

79
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:41,461
Of course.

80
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:45,131
His heartless sister
abandoned him as a child.

81
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,176
No wonder he lost his temper.

82
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,553
[Seondeok] Tsk, tsk, tsk.

83
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:51,846
Bring her in.

84
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:57,268
[door opens, closes]

85
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:16,996
It is done.

86
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,083
Leave us.

87
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,670
She tried to kill you, Mother.

88
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,549
Why should I worry when I have you?
I'll be fine.

89
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,561
[door opens, closes]

90
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:43,481
You shouldn't resent me.

91
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:45,734
The accident had crushed his leg,

92
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:50,196
but I was the one who treated him
and took him under my wing.

93
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,783
The least you can do is thank me.

94
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,494
You tried to get him killed.

95
00:08:56,578 --> 00:09:00,874
Mr. Jo ran him over with the car, not me.

96
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,585
But he lost one of his eyes
because of you.

97
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,754
Doesn't that make us even?

98
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,508
Whoa, whoa.

99
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,054
No need to sharpen the blade.

100
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:17,098
I have no intention
of revealing your true identity.

101
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:20,477
We're in the same boat now.

102
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:25,857
I'd love for you to become the first lady.

103
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:27,400
I sincerely do.

104
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,652
Drop the bullshit.

105
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,572
Don't you want to protect your brother?

106
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,825
If the truth of that day 15 years ago
comes out,

107
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:39,371
you must know your brother
will be in grave danger.

[Seondeok sighs]

109
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,464
We'd be remiss if you stay out too late.

110
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:53,426
We must be precious
about our future first lady.

Yes, Mother Director.

113
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,397
[Seondeok] Think carefully

114
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:07,941
about how to best protect No. 105.

115
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:14,322
Take Ms. Hong home.

116

- Yes, ma'am.

Why would she be there?

If Director Kim did this to Mr. Park

and Taera was there,

00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,652
How many times do I have to tell you
she's gone?

164
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:46,905
Still can't forget your shitty sister?

165
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:50,533
She told me we would live together.

166
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:52,452
She said she'd never leave me again!

167
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,414
It's been months since you had surgery,

168
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:58,792
and your sister never once showed up!

169
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,711
No! She's coming. She's coming for me--

170
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:04,464
Wrong. She's never coming back.

171
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:07,842
The only person you have left to trust…

172
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:14,683
is me.

173
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:18,895
Mother Director is all you have now,
No. 105.

174
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:21,648
Your Mother Director.

175
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:25,026
No. 105…

176
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:29,406
I'm all you have.

177
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:41,459
[pills rattle]

178
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,391
[sighs]

179
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:11,614
[Jaehyun]
<i>Who did you plant to keep tabs on me?</i>

180
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:15,994
Who's the brave soul
who dared to tread on my turf…

181
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:20,373
and take these photos of me?

182
00:17:23,835 --> 00:17:29,049
I get my answer
before you get yours, Mr. Pyo!

183
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,099
Something wrong?

184
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:40,185
No, it's nothing.

185
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:42,687
Were you crying?

186
00:17:44,356 --> 00:17:45,357
Don't be silly.

187
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:49,527
I couldn't reach you earlier.

188
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:52,072
Where'd you go? I was worried.

189
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:54,491
I went out for some air.

190
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:56,701
I have security anyway.

191
00:17:58,495 --> 00:17:59,704
I'll go check on Jiu.

192
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:01,998
Don't fret over Haesoo.

193
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:06,294
You don't have to be apologetic
to Dojin either.

194
00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:11,549
Right, now let's think about us.

195
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:15,345
"Us"?

196
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:18,640
You, me, and Jiu.

197
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,768
The most precious people in my life.

198
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:24,479
My family is all I need.

199
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:26,564
Don't you feel the same?

200
00:18:32,487 --> 00:18:36,658
Haesoo and Dojin
are important people in our lives too.

201
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:39,619
Not anymore.

202
00:18:43,415 --> 00:18:46,209
By the way, we found office space
for the campaign team.

203
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,003
I know it hasn't been easy.

204
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:51,423
And there seems to be a problem
with the town house security.

205
00:18:51,923 --> 00:18:54,384
I might replace all staff
and security personnel.

206
00:18:56,928 --> 00:18:57,929
Even Pilseung?

207
00:18:58,638 --> 00:18:59,639
Mmm.

208
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:04,185
Can we keep him around?

209
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:08,940
Jiu gets along with him well,
and I feel comfortable with him too.

210
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:12,235
I don't want to have
to get used to someone new.

211
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:16,448
If you have a problem with him,

212
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:19,075
I'd prefer if we don't replace him.

213
00:19:22,746 --> 00:19:24,289
[chuckles]

214
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:26,082
If that's what you want.

215
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:30,253
Thank you.

216
00:19:46,978 --> 00:19:48,980
Is Director Koo still in there?

217
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:51,316
He pulled an all-nighter.

218
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:56,363
[Yang] Director Koo.

219
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,115
What? What's going on?

220
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:02,577
Have you begun a new research project?
Anything I can help with?

221
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,329
Nope. Don't worry about that.

222
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:09,668
Right. Beware that the special research
lab is off-limits for the time being.

223
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:11,169
If you dare go in,

224
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:12,379
you're dead.

225
00:20:13,672 --> 00:20:15,131
- Yes, sir.
- [scientist] Understood.

226
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:24,224
Going somewhere?

227
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:27,143
Thought I'd take some food to Sungchan.

228
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:30,021
He's been looking out of sorts
after Yura's incident.

229
00:20:30,105 --> 00:20:32,732
I should've checked up on him.
Thank you, honey.

230
00:20:33,316 --> 00:20:35,985
- You're coming to the office opening?
- We'll see.

231
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:45,704
- Be sure to pack everything.
- [assistant] Yes, sir.

232
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:48,456
[cell phone vibrates]

233
00:20:52,127 --> 00:20:53,128
Yeah, it's me.

234
00:20:53,211 --> 00:20:55,672
Director Koo banned us
from entering the special lab,

235
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:59,009
so I can't confirm the subject's status.
Apologies, sir.

236
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:00,760
Do anything you can to find out

237
00:21:00,844 --> 00:21:04,681
if the smart patch works on humans
and if the Neural Input Program succeeded.

238
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,225
Find out, no matter what, okay?

239
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:12,022
[Jaehyun] <i>If Kyojin is awake,</i>

240
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:15,400
<i>that can only mean</i>
<i>Sungchan has the flash drive.</i>

241
00:21:17,444 --> 00:21:19,112
[No. 50] <i>Is Kyojin awake?</i>

242
00:21:20,363 --> 00:21:24,034
He's conscious now,
but communicating is another issue.

243
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:27,829
The input process might take longer,
since he's been comatose for so long.

244
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:29,289
Does Jaehyun know?

245
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:33,335
No, but he'll probably
do anything to find out.

246
00:21:33,835 --> 00:21:37,297
Are you sure Jaehyun had a hand
in Kyojin's accident?

247
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:40,050
Only Kyojin will know for sure.

248
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:46,431
If Jaehyun was behind the accident,
why would he want Kyojin to wake up?

249
00:21:47,474 --> 00:21:49,184
It would do him no good.

250
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:52,937
I can't figure that out either.

251
00:21:58,026 --> 00:21:59,986
When will you tell Dojin?

252
00:22:00,612 --> 00:22:04,240
Make one careless move,
and Jaehyun will suspect me.

253
00:22:04,908 --> 00:22:08,912
For now, we'll have to wait
until the Neural Input Program is done.

254
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:12,165
Sungchan,

255
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:14,959
I need your help.

Welcome, Ms. Hong. Oh, thank you.

You all must be exhausted.

- Help him as much as you can.
- Of course.

268
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:50,245
Also, this isn't much,
but take the staff out for a nice meal.

269
00:22:50,328 --> 00:22:52,288
We appreciate it. Thank you!

270
00:22:52,956 --> 00:22:54,165
Yay!

271
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:56,835
Well, that uplifted the mood.

272
00:22:58,128 --> 00:23:00,255
Let me know if you need anything.

273
00:23:00,338 --> 00:23:01,715
I will. Thank you, Taera.

274
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:06,094
Pardon me, sir.
You must leave now for the luncheon.

275
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:08,430
Go ahead, honey.

276
00:23:08,513 --> 00:23:10,682
Is it okay if I look around a little?

277
00:23:10,765 --> 00:23:13,727
Well, of course. Look around all you want.

278
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:16,229
- Shall we go?
- Yes, sir. This way.

PYO JAEHYUN WILL DO IT!
INDEPENDENT, PYO JAEHYUN

280
00:23:31,036 --> 00:23:33,872
I have control of the cameras.
Let's begin.

281
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:37,751
The wiretap is planted under the desk.

282
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:40,587
As for the camera…

283
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:44,591
One moment.

284
00:23:47,469 --> 00:23:48,553
<i>Can you see me?</i>

285
00:23:48,636 --> 00:23:50,388
[Sungchan] Clear as day.

286
00:23:50,472 --> 00:23:53,266
I've disabled the sensors
from catching any signals.

287
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,434
And now we hack

288
00:23:55,685 --> 00:23:57,645
Jaehyun's car system.

289
00:23:58,396 --> 00:23:59,814
Okay.

What time is it?

298
00:24:51,616 --> 00:24:53,702
Sleep some more. You barely got any.

299
00:24:53,785 --> 00:24:56,538
No, I need to call the jeweler.

300
00:24:56,621 --> 00:24:58,665
I called them already.

301
00:25:02,127 --> 00:25:03,461
Thank you, Dojin.

302
00:25:04,754 --> 00:25:06,840
I don't deserve your gratitude yet.

303
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:10,093
First, we catch the real killer
and the mastermind.

304
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:13,138
Then-- Then let's pay our respects
to your parents.

305
00:25:19,352 --> 00:25:20,353
My mom,

306
00:25:21,438 --> 00:25:24,232
even through all the accusations,

307
00:25:26,151 --> 00:25:28,278
she never once complained to me.

308
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:34,701
But I…

309
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:40,331
I was so scared she might have had
something to do with it.

310
00:25:42,917 --> 00:25:44,336
So I avoided her.

311
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,674
If it's because of me…

312
00:25:51,551 --> 00:25:53,762
If my treatment of her
drove her to suicide,

313
00:25:54,804 --> 00:25:56,806
how can I live with that, Dojin?

314
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:01,811
It's not your fault.

315
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,940
She wouldn't have thought of you
that way, Haesoo. Never.

316
00:26:08,777 --> 00:26:14,032
Your parents would know better than anyone
about your efforts to get to the truth.

317
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:19,537
So, let's uncover this together
and see who's behind all this.

318
00:26:36,596 --> 00:26:38,932
Hey, Mr. Park. How are you feeling?

00:26:47,232 --> 00:26:48,566
Han Kyungrok did that?

323
00:26:49,567 --> 00:26:53,363
How is Chairman Jang doing?
He's a hard man to meet these days.

324
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:54,447
NO. 1, HAN KYUNGROK

325
00:26:54,531 --> 00:26:58,451
I've been a nuisance to him recently.
I'm sure I'm not making it easier for him.

326
00:26:58,535 --> 00:27:02,831
[laughs] Your special with Candidate Pyo
sure was quite entertaining.

327
00:27:03,707 --> 00:27:06,876
I doubt you caused such a commotion
based purely on conjecture.

328
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,378
There is something, huh?

329
00:27:09,796 --> 00:27:12,507
The article on Hong's fake identity
was also enjoyable.

330
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:14,551
It was almost identical to my findings.

331
00:27:15,468 --> 00:27:17,762
I know someone who corroborated the truth.

332
00:27:19,848 --> 00:27:22,058
You mean there's a witness?

333
00:27:22,976 --> 00:27:25,186
Yes. The real Hong Taera's friend.

334
00:27:27,188 --> 00:27:28,940
But I can't seem to reach her.

335
00:27:29,024 --> 00:27:30,817
I've sent someone over to find her.

336
00:27:32,152 --> 00:27:33,445
Mr. Pyo… Wow.

337
00:27:34,904 --> 00:27:37,407
He sure has a knack for surprises.

338
00:27:38,116 --> 00:27:40,410
We have some information ourselves.

339
00:27:41,661 --> 00:27:43,955
It's about Mr. Pyo's late mother.

340
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:46,624
She was quite problematic.

341
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:48,084
Not that we're complaining.

342
00:27:53,048 --> 00:27:56,051
CANDIDATE NO. 1 HAN KYUNGROK

343
00:28:04,392 --> 00:28:06,519
What's with the long face? What'd he say?

344
00:28:07,145 --> 00:28:10,523
Have you, by any chance,
heard anything about Jaehyun's parents?

345
00:28:11,983 --> 00:28:14,486
I've never heard anything
about his father,

346
00:28:14,569 --> 00:28:17,405
but I know his mother passed away
in a car crash.

347
00:28:18,448 --> 00:28:19,908
I heard she was a doctor.

348
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:23,286
And how did you first meet Jaehyun?

349
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:31,044
Damn it.

350
00:28:31,127 --> 00:28:34,047
- Damn bastard's not picking up.
- Still no answer?

351
00:28:34,589 --> 00:28:35,590
Game's starting soon.

352
00:28:36,925 --> 00:28:41,012
Maybe he chickened out?
Face it, you've lost.

353
00:28:41,096 --> 00:28:42,972
Oh, that sh--

354
00:28:43,598 --> 00:28:45,558
Man, can't anyone take his place?

355
00:28:45,642 --> 00:28:46,643
[stranger] Can I jump in?

356
00:28:50,647 --> 00:28:52,691
Who are you?

357
00:28:52,774 --> 00:28:53,817
I'm Pyo Jaehyun.

358
00:28:55,068 --> 00:28:56,569
- Pleasure.
- Can you play ball?

359
00:29:05,829 --> 00:29:07,080
- [spectator] It's in!
- [spectator 2] Wow!

360
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:12,335
- [player] Shoot!
- [all] Wow!

361
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:14,838
- [player 2] Good going, man!
- [all] All right!

362
00:29:29,853 --> 00:29:31,438
- [Dojin] Good game, man!
- Wow!

363
00:29:32,731 --> 00:29:34,065
You're pretty good.

364
00:29:34,566 --> 00:29:37,861
- What's your major?
- Neural engineering. I transferred here.

365
00:29:37,944 --> 00:29:40,655
- And before?
- Seoul University, College of Medicine.

366
00:29:40,739 --> 00:29:43,324
No wonder I'd never seen you before.

367
00:29:43,408 --> 00:29:46,244
We know everyone who can play ball here.

368
00:29:47,203 --> 00:29:48,288
Let's go.

369
00:29:48,371 --> 00:29:51,332
[Dojin] Drinks on me today!
See you at the usual spot.

370
00:29:51,416 --> 00:29:52,584
Order anything you want!

371
00:29:52,667 --> 00:29:53,710
[cheering]

372
00:29:53,793 --> 00:29:56,504
Come on. Let's go! It's a go from me!

373
00:29:56,588 --> 00:29:57,922
Well,

374
00:29:58,006 --> 00:30:00,091
instead of drinks, can you do me a favor?

375
00:30:01,343 --> 00:30:03,470
Introduce me to the club president.

376
00:30:03,553 --> 00:30:04,554
My brother?

377
00:30:04,637 --> 00:30:08,141
I transferred here because of Kyojin.
I want to join his research team.

378
00:30:11,603 --> 00:30:13,938
He transferred to KAIST because of Kyojin?

379
00:30:14,856 --> 00:30:16,649
What was he researching at the time?

380
00:30:16,733 --> 00:30:20,612
Some research about cranial nerves.

381
00:30:20,695 --> 00:30:24,699
He was quite popular back then too,
and people were dying to meet him.

382
00:30:24,783 --> 00:30:27,160
He was the genius from a wealthy family.

383
00:30:27,243 --> 00:30:31,581
A lot of people hid their true colors
to get to know him through me,

384
00:30:31,664 --> 00:30:34,751
but Jaehyun was straightforward.

385
00:30:34,834 --> 00:30:37,671
What about the friend
who was supposed to play?

386
00:30:37,754 --> 00:30:40,298
There was an accident on his way here.

387
00:30:40,382 --> 00:30:42,425
His bicycle suddenly broke down.

388
00:30:43,468 --> 00:30:45,637
He even had to get surgery.

389
00:30:48,098 --> 00:30:51,017
But Jaehyun suddenly appeared
to take his spot.

390
00:30:54,437 --> 00:30:56,981
Dojin, can you look into Jaehyun
some more?

391
00:30:57,482 --> 00:31:00,610
From when he was at SNU Medicine--
No, even before then.

392
00:31:00,694 --> 00:31:03,363
Especially about his late mother.

393
00:31:12,831 --> 00:31:15,083
[Younghwee] How is Kyojin doing?

394
00:31:15,166 --> 00:31:17,544
[Jaehyun] We're operating the system,
and it's going well.

395
00:31:17,627 --> 00:31:21,548
It won't be easy to recover
after seven years, but don't worry.

396
00:31:21,631 --> 00:31:24,759
Some may say this is a miracle,
but not me.

397
00:31:25,427 --> 00:31:27,137
My Kyojin is very strong.

398
00:31:27,846 --> 00:31:29,723
He's going to walk again.

399
00:31:29,806 --> 00:31:32,058
Of course. I know Kyojin will.

400
00:31:33,309 --> 00:31:34,519
He has to.

401
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:40,984
I'm planning to buy Kumjo stocks
under Kyojin's name.

402
00:31:41,776 --> 00:31:43,153
Great idea, Ms. Min.

403
00:31:43,236 --> 00:31:45,488
Kyojin should take over Kumjo,
rightfully so.

404
00:31:46,114 --> 00:31:50,827
My husband will find out in no time
and try to rush Dojin's succession.

405
00:31:52,203 --> 00:31:53,997
We can't let that happen.

406
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,710
For Kyojin.

407
00:32:04,591 --> 00:32:07,469
I'll get going.
The campaign team's dealing with a crisis.

408
00:32:07,552 --> 00:32:10,263
If I'm not careful, I may lose this game.

409
00:32:10,347 --> 00:32:11,514
Not on my watch.

410
00:32:11,598 --> 00:32:13,099
Can I help in any way?

411
00:32:13,933 --> 00:32:16,811
Whether it's campaign funds or anything,
just say the word.

412
00:32:18,021 --> 00:32:19,481
I have enough money, Ms. Min--

413
00:32:19,564 --> 00:32:20,565
I know,

414
00:32:20,648 --> 00:32:24,027
but funds from your own company
can look bad for you in politics.

415
00:32:26,321 --> 00:32:28,740
I have some cash saved up.

416
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:36,498
[Sangbae] Here are Kumjo Group's
financial statements

417
00:32:36,581 --> 00:32:37,874
from the past five years.

418
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:41,211
Starting tomorrow,
we'll start visiting our subsidiaries.

419
00:32:41,294 --> 00:32:44,964
Before your succession,
you should introduce yourself first.

420
00:32:45,048 --> 00:32:47,467
Chairman Jang has planned
your itinerary himself.

421
00:32:49,052 --> 00:32:53,390
Well, it looks like he'd always been
prepared for my return to Kumjo.

422
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:56,935
Everything is meant
to fall into its rightful place.

423
00:32:57,811 --> 00:32:59,562
Please tell my father,

424
00:32:59,646 --> 00:33:01,523
now that I'm back at Kumjo,

425
00:33:02,482 --> 00:33:04,901
he must keep his promise to help my wife.

426
00:33:06,236 --> 00:33:07,237
Yes, sir.

427
00:33:10,323 --> 00:33:11,324
Also…

428
00:33:13,868 --> 00:33:15,704
can I ask for a personal favor?

429
00:33:19,332 --> 00:33:21,334
I'd appreciate it if Father didn't know.

430
00:33:23,169 --> 00:33:24,421
From hospital records

431
00:33:24,504 --> 00:33:28,591
to proof of employment at
the travel agency following her discharge,

432
00:33:28,675 --> 00:33:31,011
I sent them all to you.

433
00:33:31,094 --> 00:33:34,347
This claim about identity fraud
is outrageous!

434
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:37,600
[line beeps]

435
00:33:46,943 --> 00:33:50,155
The articles about Ms. Hong's
identity fraud have been refuted.

436
00:33:51,406 --> 00:33:52,407
By any chance,

437
00:33:53,033 --> 00:33:55,493
is there anything else
we should be aware of?

438
00:33:55,577 --> 00:33:57,579
If there are any more issues about her--

439
00:33:57,662 --> 00:34:00,457
Sounds like you're assuming
there will be more problems.

440
00:34:03,126 --> 00:34:05,295
Can you not handle situations like this?

441
00:34:06,713 --> 00:34:10,508
Sir, your approval rating is plummeting
at the moment.

442
00:34:10,592 --> 00:34:13,094
Han Kyungrok's team will strike
even harder.

443
00:34:14,095 --> 00:34:17,557
Do you want to lose in this game
before we even hit the streets?

444
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:21,978
I will make sure you win the election,
no matter what.

445
00:34:22,062 --> 00:34:25,065
Not only for you, Candidate Pyo,
but also for me.

446
00:34:26,524 --> 00:34:29,611
If that's how you feel,
I have nothing to worry about,

447
00:34:29,694 --> 00:34:31,696
even if a bigger issue arises.

448
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,114
Pardon?

449
00:34:35,075 --> 00:34:38,203
Will 10 billion won be enough
to deal with the press?

450
00:34:39,245 --> 00:34:42,832
After all, doesn't money do the talking
in election campaigns

451
00:34:44,334 --> 00:34:46,753
rather than the campaign manager's mouth?

452
00:34:52,384 --> 00:34:53,927

<i>to run a background check on you.</i>

457

Go for it. I've been waiting for this.

458
00:35:12,153 --> 00:35:13,530

- Hmm?

Tell Director Kim

that I'll be seeing her soon.

I suppose Pyo Jaehyun…

is done with me.

- [bangs]

00:37:35,213 --> 00:37:36,881
[No. 50] <i>I thought you were dead.</i>

481
00:37:36,965 --> 00:37:39,259
<i>After you fell off my bike,</i>

482
00:37:39,342 --> 00:37:41,886
<i>I fell off the cliff.</i>
<i>Then I lost my memory.</i>

483
00:37:42,971 --> 00:37:46,266
Had I known you were at Hanwool,
I would've gotten you out of there.

484
00:37:46,349 --> 00:37:48,309
I would've never left you with her.

485
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:00,363
Hey!

486
00:38:00,447 --> 00:38:01,865
What are you doing?

487
00:38:03,742 --> 00:38:06,703
That kind of violent behavior
is unacceptable.

488
00:38:09,873 --> 00:38:11,082
Mr. Cha!

489
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:15,086
How dare you shout while on duty?

490
00:38:15,837 --> 00:38:18,798
At the town house with children, huh?

491
00:38:18,882 --> 00:38:20,300
[Jiu] You want to die?

492
00:38:21,384 --> 00:38:23,595
Why are you acting like you're his boss?

493
00:38:23,678 --> 00:38:26,931
- Want me to bring my gun out again?
- I wasn't acting like his boss!

494
00:38:27,015 --> 00:38:30,852
He was kicking the trash
and screaming "Ah! Ah!"

495
00:38:30,935 --> 00:38:34,939
Mr. Cha was being bad.
Should he be paid to act like that?

496
00:38:35,023 --> 00:38:39,486
My uncle's just a man. If something's
bothering him, he can shout and get angry.

497
00:38:39,569 --> 00:38:41,279
What's wrong with that?

498
00:38:41,363 --> 00:38:45,992
And my uncle's super nice.
I know him better than you.

499
00:38:46,076 --> 00:38:48,036
I'm warning you, don't mess with me.

500
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:51,790
[Leo] Dang it, you.
I'm telling my grandpa everything!

501
00:38:51,873 --> 00:38:55,293
Both of you, don't talk to me ever again!

502
00:38:55,377 --> 00:38:56,461
Gosh.

503
00:38:57,045 --> 00:38:59,923
What? That brat.

504
00:39:00,006 --> 00:39:01,174
Uncle, you okay?

505
00:39:01,257 --> 00:39:05,804
Just you wait. I need to finish this fight
with my grumpy bestie.

506
00:39:05,887 --> 00:39:07,347
Jang Leo!

507

[clapping]

508
00:39:18,775 --> 00:39:20,235
[Jo] How touching.

509
00:39:22,362 --> 00:39:25,198
No. 50's daughter recognizes her own kin.

510
00:39:26,282 --> 00:39:28,576
She cares for her uncle quite deeply.

511
00:39:29,285 --> 00:39:31,121
I almost teared up a little.

512
00:39:31,204 --> 00:39:32,706
Watch what you say.

513
00:39:32,789 --> 00:39:34,708
You shouldn't be wandering around.

514
00:39:39,796 --> 00:39:41,840
Why haven't you killed No. 50 yet?

515
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:43,591
Just say the word.

516
00:39:43,675 --> 00:39:45,677
If you don't think you can do it,

517
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,887
I'll kill her for you right now.

518
00:39:52,308 --> 00:39:53,309
What's this?

519
00:39:55,061 --> 00:39:58,064
Don't tell me you're having doubts
because she's blood.

520
00:39:59,733 --> 00:40:02,235
Don't tell me you'll betray
Mother Director?

521
00:40:03,653 --> 00:40:05,530
[Jo chuckles] Tsk, tsk, tsk.

522
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:09,409
You really shouldn't bite the hand
that feeds you.

523
00:40:09,492 --> 00:40:12,662
- I said watch what you say!
- I saw you hesitate.

524
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:18,585
I told you to never let your enemy
know your next move.

525
00:40:20,837 --> 00:40:21,880
You know,

526
00:40:23,089 --> 00:40:27,135
all I've been thinking about lately is
how I'm going to kill that bitch No. 50…

527
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:32,265
and how to make it
for a wife of a famous household

528
00:40:33,308 --> 00:40:35,518
as terrible and horrific as possible.

529
00:40:37,687 --> 00:40:39,147
Thinking about it

530
00:40:40,315 --> 00:40:42,525
has made my life quite enjoyable.

531
00:40:43,777 --> 00:40:45,612
Improves my appetite too.

532
00:40:48,615 --> 00:40:49,616
[thuds]

533
00:41:15,809 --> 00:41:16,935
Damn it.

534
00:41:25,652 --> 00:41:28,822
He's conscious, but why can't he talk?

535
00:41:29,614 --> 00:41:30,949
Is he a living corpse?

536
00:41:31,616 --> 00:41:33,118
Kyojin!

537
00:41:33,201 --> 00:41:34,494
Shit.

538
00:41:48,591 --> 00:41:49,592
Huh?

539
00:41:56,933 --> 00:41:58,768
Who the hell is this guy?

540
00:42:18,913 --> 00:42:20,415
It's been a while, Chairman.

541
00:42:24,336 --> 00:42:27,797
What the hell brings you here? [chuckles]

542
00:42:29,507 --> 00:42:31,259
My goodness.

543
00:42:32,552 --> 00:42:37,098
Your face looks even more worn
than my old, wrinkly face.

544
00:42:39,059 --> 00:42:43,104
Weren't you pointing fingers at me,
as if I'd done something to Ko Taesun?

545
00:42:44,564 --> 00:42:45,565
Oh, right.

546
00:42:47,025 --> 00:42:50,320
I hear your wife's an assassin,
something or other?

547
00:42:51,905 --> 00:42:55,450
She must be causing you so much grief.

548
00:42:57,327 --> 00:42:58,870
I'm a presidential candidate.

549
00:42:59,913 --> 00:43:04,084
I'm being vetted as the nation's
strictest and fairest figure,

550
00:43:04,834 --> 00:43:06,544
so don't you worry about me.

551
00:43:08,171 --> 00:43:10,423
Instead, shall we take a trip
down memory lane?

552
00:43:11,174 --> 00:43:14,135
I figure you'll also find it
quite interesting, Chairman.

553
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:25,647
Here are some files on Pyo Jaehyun
that we have at Kumjo.

554
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:28,191
I'm sure you'll find
what you need in there.

555
00:43:28,274 --> 00:43:31,152
- Thank you, Mr. Uhm.
- We appreciate this.

[paper rustles]

[Jaehyun] <i>Do you remember Dr. Kim Sohye?</i>

558
00:43:53,133 --> 00:43:57,262
Dr. Kim Sohye ran
a small private clinic in Samcheok.

559
00:43:59,097 --> 00:44:00,098
Who?

560
00:44:02,142 --> 00:44:03,727
And what about ammothamnine?

Treatment for cranial nerve disorders
that you sold to a foreign company

562
00:44:08,857 --> 00:44:10,483
about 20 years ago.

563
00:44:13,194 --> 00:44:17,198
You stole the technology from Dr. Kim
and killed her.

564
00:44:19,367 --> 00:44:20,910
I'm sure you remember this.

565
00:44:35,216 --> 00:44:36,676

[line ringing]

571
00:45:30,563 --> 00:45:32,023
It's taken care of, Chairman.

572
00:45:33,316 --> 00:45:35,276
I've secured Dr. Kim's research files.

573
00:45:36,569 --> 00:45:37,570
Yes, sir.

574
00:45:42,992 --> 00:45:45,245
[Dojin] <i>Dr. Kim Sohye,</i>
<i>a research director,</i>

575
00:45:45,328 --> 00:45:48,707
<i>developed a treatment for dementia</i>
<i>for a large corporation.</i>

576
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:52,168
<i>She was found to have pocketed</i>
<i>the research funds.</i>

577
00:45:52,252 --> 00:45:56,631
<i>When the truth came out,</i>
<i>Dr. Kim stole the research files and fled.</i>

578
00:45:56,715 --> 00:45:59,801
She caused a car crash while driving drunk
and died instantly,

579
00:45:59,884 --> 00:46:02,679
so did the passengers
in the other vehicle.

580
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:04,431
[Haesoo gasps]

581
00:46:06,391 --> 00:46:08,560
So he kept it all hidden for a reason.

582
00:46:09,686 --> 00:46:13,023
Jaehyun couldn't talk about his mother.

583
00:46:13,106 --> 00:46:16,067
It says the research was funded
by Kumjo Pharmaceuticals,

584
00:46:16,151 --> 00:46:18,486
but why did Father
never mention this before?

585
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:20,780
He was probably waiting
for the right timing.

586
00:46:21,489 --> 00:46:25,910
Maybe he was waiting to bring it up
just before the election.

587
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:31,750
Clearly, Jaehyun was holding a grudge, and
that's why he approached you and Kyojin.

588
00:46:31,833 --> 00:46:33,918
Holding a grudge for what?

589
00:46:34,002 --> 00:46:36,838
According to this article,
his mother's at fault.

590
00:46:36,921 --> 00:46:38,631
It's probably misguided vengeance.

591
00:46:40,091 --> 00:46:43,928
After the accident, he dropped out
of SNU Medicine and transferred to KAIST.

592
00:46:45,513 --> 00:46:48,600
Getting you kicked out of Hatch
was all a part of his plan.

593
00:46:50,101 --> 00:46:51,186
[bell dings]

594
00:46:52,479 --> 00:46:54,397
It's Mr. Park. I asked him for a favor.

595
00:46:58,318 --> 00:46:59,903
[Haesoo] <i>Did you go to Samcheok?</i>

596
00:47:00,612 --> 00:47:03,656
Did you get to meet
any of Dr. Kim's coworkers?

597
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:06,034
I got in touch with one of her colleagues.

598
00:47:06,117 --> 00:47:11,456
She said Dr. Kim conducted illegal human
trials on her own patients at the clinic

599
00:47:11,956 --> 00:47:13,500
in the name of research.

600
00:47:13,583 --> 00:47:15,251
By force?

601
00:47:15,335 --> 00:47:17,921
Without the patient or guardian's consent?

602
00:47:18,797 --> 00:47:21,383
Several patients died during the research,

603
00:47:21,466 --> 00:47:24,094
but it was swept under the rug
after she died.

604
00:47:24,177 --> 00:47:25,929
All the details are in here.

605
00:47:28,807 --> 00:47:30,975
Wait. What are you going to do?

606
00:47:31,059 --> 00:47:33,895
This is enough to make Jaehyun
lose the election.

607
00:47:33,978 --> 00:47:37,524
You're going to do it? We're not exactly
media darlings right now.

608
00:47:38,817 --> 00:47:42,112
Why wouldn't I?
He's a presidential candidate, isn't he?

609
00:47:45,365 --> 00:47:46,741
Stop talking nonsense!

610
00:47:47,409 --> 00:47:49,994
I've never put out a hit on anyone.

611
00:47:50,078 --> 00:47:53,289
I don't know what you've heard,

612
00:47:53,915 --> 00:47:56,042
but her death has nothing to do with me.

613
00:47:56,126 --> 00:47:59,254
You think there's no evidence
that proves you ordered Dr. Kim

614
00:47:59,337 --> 00:48:00,922
to conduct illegal human trials?

615
00:48:03,008 --> 00:48:04,592
My poor mother…

616
00:48:06,219 --> 00:48:09,556
was framed for all your bullshit
and wrongfully murdered.

617
00:48:12,225 --> 00:48:13,518
You remember that?

618
00:48:16,688 --> 00:48:18,023
M-- Mother?

619
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:20,191
That's right.

620
00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:26,573
The person in the passenger seat next
to Dr. Kim on that night of the accident,

621
00:48:27,615 --> 00:48:31,828
her one and only son
who survived the crash and got away,

622
00:48:33,329 --> 00:48:35,040
is standing before you now.

623
00:48:40,045 --> 00:48:43,757
Evidence that you gave orders to Mr. Uhm
and the truth about that accident,

624
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:47,719
I have it all. Got it?

625
00:48:53,099 --> 00:48:54,893
But here you are, shameless.

626

an honest businessman.

00:49:31,096 --> 00:49:33,640
I-- It's… It's all a misunderstanding.

638
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,981
[Jaehyun] Oh.

639
00:49:42,065 --> 00:49:44,275
This is no time for a stroke, Chairman.

640
00:49:45,235 --> 00:49:48,238
Your son and his wife
are looking into this case, as we speak.

641
00:49:53,118 --> 00:49:55,453
They might discover your true colors.

642
00:49:56,329 --> 00:49:57,622
You okay with that?

643
00:49:57,706 --> 00:50:00,291
You-- You… How…

644
00:50:05,338 --> 00:50:09,134
If you want to keep your filthy secrets
from the world…

645
00:50:15,515 --> 00:50:19,477
you better stop your son
and his wife yourself.

646
00:50:26,026 --> 00:50:27,777
I'll be watching

647
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:31,364
to see how you decide
to cover up your sins.

648
00:50:36,494 --> 00:50:38,496
[Kummo] You fucking bastard.

649
00:50:40,290 --> 00:50:42,167
Why, I ought to--

650
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:45,045
[Kummo groans]

651
00:50:46,129 --> 00:50:48,548
[Kummo gasping]

652
00:50:50,258 --> 00:50:53,094
His health must be failing.
Take him to a hospital quickly.

653
00:50:53,178 --> 00:50:54,721
[Sangbae] Chairman!

654
00:50:54,804 --> 00:50:57,390
- Get Dr. Choi on the phone now!
- [assistant] Yes, sir.

655
00:50:57,474 --> 00:50:58,475
[Sangbae] Chairman!

656
00:50:59,142 --> 00:51:00,393
[Kummo sighs]

657
00:51:00,477 --> 00:51:01,770
[Sangbae] Chairman!

658
00:51:10,570 --> 00:51:11,571
Chairman!

659
00:51:12,155 --> 00:51:13,156
Chairman!

660
00:51:17,077 --> 00:51:18,828
The researcher who pocketed

661
00:51:18,912 --> 00:51:23,708
the funds that Kumjo Pharmaceuticals
generously provided at the time

662
00:51:24,209 --> 00:51:26,628
is none other than Candidate Pyo's mother!

663
00:51:27,879 --> 00:51:32,384
When the truth was revealed, she took
the research files and ran off into night.

664
00:51:32,884 --> 00:51:36,930
On top of that, she was driving
under the influence of alcohol.

665
00:51:37,013 --> 00:51:42,310
But the person who accompanied her while
she was on the run was Candidate Pyo!

666
00:51:43,103 --> 00:51:46,648
How will a presidential candidate
with such moral issues

667
00:51:46,731 --> 00:51:50,110
be able to govern a nation?

668
00:51:50,193 --> 00:51:53,446
He has covered up the evil sins
committed by his mother

669
00:51:53,530 --> 00:51:56,157
and has encouraged his wife to lie.

670
00:51:56,241 --> 00:52:01,996
Such are the true colors
of Candidate Pyo Jaehyun!

671
00:52:04,082 --> 00:52:07,544
[shutters clicking]

672
00:52:07,627 --> 00:52:10,422
It's perfect.
His ratings will go up by 10%.

673
00:52:12,132 --> 00:52:14,300
They say help comes
from unexpected places,

674
00:52:14,384 --> 00:52:16,928
but who knew it would be Anchorwoman Ko?

675
00:52:17,929 --> 00:52:20,682
We got Candidate Pyo real good this time.

676
00:52:36,239 --> 00:52:39,617
Did you really approach Kyojin and me
to get revenge?

677
00:52:42,037 --> 00:52:43,496
Kyojin's accident…

678
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:46,291
was you?

679
00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:49,961
[cell phone vibrates]

680
00:52:54,758 --> 00:52:55,759
Yes.

681
00:52:55,842 --> 00:52:58,219
There's one thing I failed to mention.

682
00:52:58,845 --> 00:53:02,474
The chairman had Pyo's mother killed
in the accident.

683
00:53:05,602 --> 00:53:09,105
If that gets out,
Kumjo will never recover.

684
00:53:09,189 --> 00:53:10,899
What on earth are you saying?

685

[line beeps]

687
00:53:18,448 --> 00:53:20,033
Han's press conference is over.

688
00:53:20,116 --> 00:53:22,952
Jaehyun won't be able
to counter this so easily.

689
00:53:26,748 --> 00:53:28,541
What's wrong? Did something happen?

690
00:53:36,758 --> 00:53:38,426
You lost Mr. Jo?

691
00:53:39,886 --> 00:53:41,596
[Seondeok] I take full responsibility.

692
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:45,141
How can I hand Hatch over
to someone of such incompetence?

693
00:53:46,685 --> 00:53:47,686
[paper rustles]

694
00:53:49,521 --> 00:53:51,731
Manhwe Group's Chairman Song Juman,

695
00:53:51,815 --> 00:53:54,275
Han Kyungrok's campaign sponsor.

696
00:53:57,570 --> 00:54:02,951
Han's funds need to run dry
for us to hit the brakes on KDP's rise.

697
00:54:03,910 --> 00:54:07,997
Please give me a chance to prove myself
and make up for my failure with Mr. Jo.

698
00:54:08,081 --> 00:54:10,750
Our ace is already prepared
and on standby.

699
00:54:12,836 --> 00:54:14,045
Your ace?

700
00:54:15,547 --> 00:54:17,757
Are you talking about Mr. Cha?

701
00:54:23,722 --> 00:54:25,849
What does everyone call Pilseung here?

702
00:54:27,142 --> 00:54:28,852
I know he's Taera's brother.

703
00:54:28,935 --> 00:54:31,062
I've already run a DNA test.

704
00:54:32,522 --> 00:54:33,523
Shall we…

705
00:54:35,275 --> 00:54:36,818
test his skills then?

706
00:55:10,977 --> 00:55:11,978
[No. 105] Yes.

707
00:55:12,729 --> 00:55:14,397
I'll take care of it tonight,

708
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:16,733
Mother Director.

709
00:55:20,236 --> 00:55:25,700
As of today, it's been decided.
The Blue House goes to Chairman Han.

710
00:55:25,784 --> 00:55:31,706
Chairman Song, we haven't even
officially begun campaigning yet.

711
00:55:31,790 --> 00:55:32,916
Stop it.

712
00:55:32,999 --> 00:55:37,003
If Pyo heard you,
he'd be so sad, seriously.

713
00:55:37,087 --> 00:55:38,588
He can be sad all he wants.

714
00:55:39,381 --> 00:55:43,009
How could he serve the nation
as a man of such pathetic character?

715
00:55:43,093 --> 00:55:45,261
That boy is still wet behind the ears.

716
00:55:45,345 --> 00:55:48,932
He should be thanking us
for even dealing with him.

717
00:55:49,015 --> 00:55:50,100
Am I not right?

718
00:55:50,183 --> 00:55:52,977
I think you may be right.

719
00:55:53,061 --> 00:55:54,062
Here's to--

720
00:55:54,145 --> 00:55:57,357
Manhwe Group's sole bet
is on KDP and Han Kyungrok.

721
00:55:58,024 --> 00:55:59,484
You know that, right?

722
00:56:00,485 --> 00:56:02,987
[Chairman Song]
We are in this together, until the end.

723
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:05,990
Of course. Of course, let's ch-- cheers.

724
00:56:06,074 --> 00:56:08,034
I'll drink to that, Chairman Song.

hefty presents for you.

728

You may find the way back
to be a little "weighty."

I told you not to shoot.

Why'd you do it? Why?

745
00:57:38,208 --> 00:57:39,834
Because it's my job.

746
00:57:45,548 --> 00:57:48,802
Because if Mother Director
gives the order, I have to do it,
