Please don't kill my brother. I beg you.

He'll be running for president.

It'd be a shame if he were ruined
in an instant.

You've always trusted me
with my decisions.

I mean, kind of.

I'm telling you he's a real nut job.

129

Red's incident taught me a few lessons.

130
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,745
I've concluded that I need
more clout to protect Hatch.

Hear, hear, my friend.

132
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:26,042
I guess Han Kyungrok was
the unexpected catalyst to your decision.

133

Plus, I have you two to thank.

Yeah, but look at this man.
That's a presidential face.

into this office.

Well, that's the spirit.

146
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:06,624
So if perhaps you do get elected,

147
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:10,712
could you please lift a few nationwide
bans on research studies?

148
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:15,467
That way, a honest company like Hatch
can run clinical trials.

149
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,926
How does that sound?

150

- Music to my ears.

You're realizing your dreams with Hatch.

00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:35,945
Research all you want at Hatch.
Why the sudden foray into politics?

156
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:39,407
It's been on my mind.
It's just happening sooner than I thought.

157
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:41,701
But I'm really sorry
I didn't tell you sooner.

- Honey.
- Taera.

Yes, it'll be tough on you.

161

They'll even try to attack Jiu.

162
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:53,880
Attacking with false rumors
is politics, after all.

- My past will become your weakness.

00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:00,970
Let's stop this now.

165
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,055
Your past?

166
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:03,932
[scoffs] What about your past?

167
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:07,894
The Hong Taera I know is a good woman,
and that's enough for me.

168
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,230
What if you lose everything
you worked for?

169
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:14,067
You and Jiu might get hurt because of me.
I'm telling you it's possible.

170
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,193
That'll never happen.

171
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:19,948
Even if something happens,
I'll do anything to protect you both.

172
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:23,368
Darling, I need you in this.

173
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:26,037
Please.

Are you two fighting?

176
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,129
Of course not. We're just talking.

177
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:35,922
What's wrong? Can't sleep?

178
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,675
Daddy, can you sleep next to me?

179
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:42,303
Mommy might sulk a little, but sure.

180
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:44,055
[Jaehyun chuckles]

181
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:47,642
You should get some rest.
Just think about it.

182
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:52,022
How do you know Director Kim Seondeok?

183
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:55,191
Why did you meet her?

184
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:58,069
Just for work.

185
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,864
She suggested we work together.

186
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:04,451
But how do you know her?

187
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:08,288
I saw her with Jiu earlier,
so I was curious.

188
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,128
- Jiu, sleep tight with Daddy.
- Okay.

189
00:13:16,171 --> 00:13:17,213
Let's go.

190
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,134
All right.

191
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:26,514
I was just helping you escape,
so you wouldn't get scolded by Mommy.

192
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:27,640
Did I do well?

193
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:29,351
- You're the best. [laughs]

[sighs] You think something happened?

203
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:02,550
As per the informant protection policy,
the police will tell us what they know.

204
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:04,010
Any word from Hanwool?

205
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:05,470
I can't reach Mr. Jo.

206
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:09,849
I requested to meet Director Kim,
so let's see how she responds.

207
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:14,938
Great work.

208
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:22,112
I just spoke to the CEO of YBC.

209
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:27,325
He was asking if you're up for hosting
a current affairs program.

210
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,870
A year's work for me
is one phone call for you, huh?

211
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:33,957
Thanks for your concern anyhow.

212
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,584
You were right about everything.

213
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:44,009
It's a poor excuse, but I put off your
father's case because I'd been so busy.

214
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,761
Forgive me, Haesoo.

215
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,641
Also…

216
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:54,519
About the earring…

217
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,063
I really know nothing about it.

218
00:14:57,147 --> 00:15:00,233
Whatever you're thinking, it's not that.
Please believe me.

219
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:06,781
Whatever the truth is,
don't ever get caught again.

220
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:09,659
Or I'll send divorce papers
to your father's office.

221
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:12,912
Okay, you can trust me. Don't worry.

Haesoo. What are you doing here?

227
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,963
You texted me for help.
You said something happened.

228
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:47,465
I did?

229
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:50,343
Oh, my. Did you get into a car accident?

230

You okay? Are you hurt?

I'm sorry.

Let's talk somewhere else and--

234
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:06,568
Have you reported this yet?
How did this happen?

235
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:08,319
I'll handle this. You can go now.

You've been acting so strange lately.

Are you all right? Are you hurt?

I'm fine.

243
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:00,622
What just happened?

00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:09,005
Are you okay?

245
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:33,446
Park says he'll take care of the car.

These are delicate times.

247

A news leak about a car explosion
won't help anyone.

I don't mean to trouble Mr. Park.

So stop making me worry about you.

You planted an explosive in my car

Were you going to kill that poor girl?

00:25:12,637 --> 00:25:14,514
What are you waiting for?

328
00:25:14,597 --> 00:25:15,974
Just stab me!

[pants]

331
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:28,653
I have one reason to keep you alive.

332
00:25:28,737 --> 00:25:30,905
I need to find out who did this to me.

333
00:25:30,989 --> 00:25:35,744
Until then, I'm going to protect Haesoo
and my family with my life.

334
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:39,539
So what will you do?

335
00:25:43,752 --> 00:25:45,128
[No. 50] Your advance payment.

336
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:48,465
Find out who put out a kill order
on Haesoo's father.

337
00:25:52,302 --> 00:25:56,264
I abide by an unbreakable rule.
Never strike a deal with a traitor.

338
00:25:57,515 --> 00:25:59,893
You betrayed me first.

339
00:25:59,976 --> 00:26:01,895
Have you forgotten
what you did to my brother?

340
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:05,857
If you lay hands on my family or Haesoo,

341
00:26:07,317 --> 00:26:08,818
I will cut you down.

342
00:26:11,071 --> 00:26:13,114
Director Kim Seondeok.

[Seondeok grunts]

[grunts, sighs]

345
00:26:56,032 --> 00:26:57,075
You scared me.

346
00:26:57,575 --> 00:26:58,702
What was that for?

347
00:26:58,785 --> 00:27:02,038
Sorry, but I called your name a few times.

348
00:27:02,122 --> 00:27:03,164
Oh, this.

349
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,585
[sighs] Why are you here at this hour?

350
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:10,505
Have you heard anything from Taera?

351
00:27:11,172 --> 00:27:12,382
About what?

352
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:14,259
I know she opens up to you a lot.

353
00:27:15,552 --> 00:27:18,972
She seemed anxious about the election,
so I was worried, that's all.

354
00:27:22,475 --> 00:27:24,978
[sighs]
Well, she told me not to say anything.

355
00:27:26,521 --> 00:27:28,857
She got into an accident yesterday.

356
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:31,568
Wasn't it a minor collision?
She said it was nothing.

357
00:27:31,651 --> 00:27:33,319
Jaehyun, it was an explosion.

358
00:27:33,987 --> 00:27:34,988
What?

359
00:27:35,071 --> 00:27:38,783
She said it was just a gas explosion,
but I think it's more than that.

360
00:27:39,451 --> 00:27:42,078
The other day, a suspicious man
broke into your house.

361
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:46,124
Anyway, I'm afraid she might be in danger.

362
00:27:48,376 --> 00:27:50,128
Why didn't she tell me any of this?

363
00:27:50,211 --> 00:27:53,506
Maybe I'm crossing the line
and making you worry for nothing.

364
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:56,885
No, you're good.
I'd been too preoccupied with work.

365
00:27:58,428 --> 00:28:00,388
How about you hire personal security
for her?

366
00:28:04,225 --> 00:28:05,268
[sighs]

367

[Seondeok] <i>So you're telling me</i>

[panting]

374
00:28:47,727 --> 00:28:49,437
[Jaehyun] You cut ties with your mistress?

375
00:28:51,815 --> 00:28:53,566
Yeah, of course.

376
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:56,611
A single bug can ruin an entire program.

377
00:28:57,737 --> 00:28:59,531
Faulty codes need to be deleted.

378
00:29:02,575 --> 00:29:05,995
I plan on continuing to climb up
with you beside me.

379
00:29:07,997 --> 00:29:10,166
Hey, you geezers up there!

380
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:14,462
Hurry up and climb. Stop your yakking.

381
00:29:14,546 --> 00:29:15,630
I can hear you!

382
00:29:16,297 --> 00:29:17,924
You talking smack about me, huh?

383
00:29:18,466 --> 00:29:19,467
We actually…

384
00:29:20,176 --> 00:29:22,470
We want to begin
the smart patch human trials.

385
00:29:22,554 --> 00:29:25,181
Red's experiment was a success,
so no reason to stall.

386
00:29:25,265 --> 00:29:29,561
Let's proceed with the human trials
in time for the second presentation.

387
00:29:30,186 --> 00:29:32,188
- [Sungchan] For real?
- What about test subjects?

388
00:29:32,272 --> 00:29:34,065
Families won't consent so easily.

389
00:29:34,149 --> 00:29:36,234
Someone's offered to help.

390
00:29:40,113 --> 00:29:42,198
[Seondeok]
<i>I have something important to tell you.</i>

391
00:29:43,908 --> 00:29:47,412
You need to hear what I have to say.

392
00:29:52,709 --> 00:29:54,544
[Seondeok claps] My goodness.

393
00:29:54,627 --> 00:29:57,589
Your smart patch technology
is groundbreaking.

394
00:29:57,672 --> 00:29:58,923
It was quite impressive.

395
00:29:59,007 --> 00:30:02,802
Appealing enough for our hospital
participate in the research.

396
00:30:04,429 --> 00:30:05,764
Define "participate."

397
00:30:05,847 --> 00:30:09,017
Our hospital will provide test subjects
for your human trials.

398
00:30:10,185 --> 00:30:12,562
I'm sure you'll appreciate
our cooperation.

399
00:30:14,314 --> 00:30:15,607
Do you mean that?

400
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:17,233
The honor's all mine

401
00:30:17,984 --> 00:30:20,945
to get to work with a great talent
such as yourself.

402
00:30:21,446 --> 00:30:23,531
[laughs]

403
00:30:25,658 --> 00:30:28,119
[Jaehyun] Several of their patients
have already agreed.

404
00:30:28,203 --> 00:30:30,955
We'll talk to their families,
and we'll start in no time.

405
00:30:31,998 --> 00:30:33,208
Wow!

406
00:30:33,291 --> 00:30:35,210
- Wow! Really?
- [Dojin laughs]

407
00:30:35,293 --> 00:30:36,461
Hey.

408
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:39,798
Now we finally get to start
a proper research.

409
00:30:39,881 --> 00:30:43,426
I told her to talk details
with you, Sungchan.

410
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:47,013
Only you truly understand
our smart patch technology.

411
00:30:47,097 --> 00:30:50,892
But Hanwool made us the offer
when all other hospitals refused us?

412
00:30:50,975 --> 00:30:52,477
Sounds very promising.

413
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,937
We got lucky.

414
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:56,690
Hey, appreciate you making it happen
by yourself.

415
00:30:56,773 --> 00:30:57,982
Great job.

416
00:30:58,066 --> 00:31:02,987
I really didn't feel like going back
to work after Red died.

417
00:31:03,071 --> 00:31:07,575
But Jaehyun, are we really
moving on to human trials now, huh?

418
00:31:07,659 --> 00:31:10,537
Before that, let's take care
of your brother Kyojin first.

419
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,539
It's about time we helped him.

420
00:31:14,082 --> 00:31:16,292
Fine, if not for my mother's sake.

421
00:31:17,502 --> 00:31:18,420
But my brother…

422
00:31:19,004 --> 00:31:20,588
would be proud of us, right?

423
00:31:20,672 --> 00:31:22,340
- [Sungchan scoffs]
- Of course.

424
00:31:22,424 --> 00:31:24,509
We made Hatch because it's what he wanted.

425
00:31:25,135 --> 00:31:28,513
If he saw us now, I think
he'd be pretty surprised.

426
00:31:29,806 --> 00:31:31,433
[clicks tongue] Damn it.

427
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:34,519
I miss Kyojin, don't you?

428
00:31:35,729 --> 00:31:37,063
It's been too long.

429
00:31:38,106 --> 00:31:39,899
Shall we go visit him, huh?

430
00:31:39,983 --> 00:31:40,817
[clicks tongue]

431
00:31:42,402 --> 00:31:43,486
Let's go!

432
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:45,155
- All right, let's go.
- Okay.

433
00:31:46,072 --> 00:31:48,033
Kyojin, the boys are coming to see you--

434
00:31:49,659 --> 00:31:50,702
Are you going to…

435
00:31:51,202 --> 00:31:52,328
ride your bike again?

436
00:31:52,829 --> 00:31:55,290
I’m going to Mt. Hongak
to check on something.

437
00:31:55,373 --> 00:31:58,209
Do you have to go?
I feel uneasy for some reason.

438
00:31:58,293 --> 00:32:00,712
Don't worry. I'll be back soon.

439
00:32:01,963 --> 00:32:03,715
You'll be back safely, right?

440
00:32:03,798 --> 00:32:04,799
Of course.

441
00:32:06,259 --> 00:32:08,261
Didn't I tell you to stop doing this?

442
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:11,097
For how long will you keep this up?

443
00:32:11,765 --> 00:32:12,932
Why are you yelling?

444
00:32:13,016 --> 00:32:14,768
You're being selfish.

445
00:32:14,851 --> 00:32:18,355
You think if you keep this up,
he's going to utter words of thanks?

446
00:32:18,938 --> 00:32:22,192
Why can't you see you're just
torturing him even more?

447
00:32:23,818 --> 00:32:26,696
Are you giving up on him for Dojin's sake?

448
00:32:31,785 --> 00:32:33,036
You got your gloves?

449
00:32:33,745 --> 00:32:35,121
Let me get them for you.

450
00:32:50,011 --> 00:32:51,638
[Seondeok] <i>Sorry to keep you waiting.</i>

451
00:32:54,099 --> 00:32:55,350
Wow.

452
00:32:55,433 --> 00:32:57,560
It's an honor, Anchorwoman Ko Haesoo.

453
00:33:00,313 --> 00:33:02,607
You wanted to see me?

454
00:33:03,858 --> 00:33:06,361
You seem busy, so I'll get
straight to the point.

455
00:33:11,241 --> 00:33:14,119
She was called No. 50,
and I'd like to see her records.

456
00:33:14,744 --> 00:33:16,705
Here's the official media request form.

457
00:33:18,873 --> 00:33:20,291
[Seondeok] Hmm.

458
00:33:21,501 --> 00:33:27,424
Mr. Jo has informed me that he told you
she's no longer a patient here.

459
00:33:27,507 --> 00:33:29,718
Ms. Jung Yusun remembers this patient.

460
00:33:30,885 --> 00:33:32,262
[stammers] Who?

461
00:33:32,345 --> 00:33:36,057
The charge nurse at Hanwool,
who's worked here for over 20 years.

462
00:33:37,684 --> 00:33:40,145
Jung Yusun… Jung Yusun…

463
00:33:42,022 --> 00:33:46,234
We don't have a nurse but a patient
by that name at our hospital.

464
00:33:48,403 --> 00:33:51,531
It appears you've been played
by this woman.

465
00:33:52,532 --> 00:33:53,533
[chuckles]

466
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:58,079
[Yusun] <i>She was admitted to Hanwool</i>
<i>about 20 years ago.</i>

467
00:33:58,163 --> 00:33:59,998

468
00:34:00,081 --> 00:34:02,250
A feral dog bit her
while she was on the run.

469
00:34:03,126 --> 00:34:04,127
A feral dog?

Ms. Jung Yusun?

473
00:34:51,257 --> 00:34:54,803
She's a long-term patient at our hospital
with a serious mental disorder.

474
00:34:55,637 --> 00:34:59,265
We also have records
of her many attempts to escape.

475
00:34:59,933 --> 00:35:04,062
She struck one of our nurses in an attempt
to escape before we caught her.

476
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:09,275
I'm not sure what she told you, Ms. Ko,

477
00:35:09,901 --> 00:35:12,112
but you shouldn't believe what you heard.

478
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:18,410
Ms. Jung, do you remember me?

479
00:35:18,993 --> 00:35:20,203
It's me, Ko Haesoo.

480
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:21,871

Messing with Haesoo was your fault,

643
00:47:29,766 --> 00:47:31,643
and dating you was mine, got it?

644
00:47:32,268 --> 00:47:33,520
[cell phone buzzes]

645
00:47:39,067 --> 00:47:40,068
Yes, Father.

646
00:47:47,784 --> 00:47:49,327
I'm not letting this go.

647
00:47:52,038 --> 00:47:53,415
My life is already pathetic.

648
00:47:54,624 --> 00:47:56,793
I should have at least
one thing that's real.

649
00:48:02,882 --> 00:48:04,050
[strains]

650
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:13,226
Where'd you go without a word?

651
00:48:14,978 --> 00:48:16,396
I needed to take a breather,

652
00:48:16,938 --> 00:48:18,189
so I went for a walk.

653
00:48:21,151 --> 00:48:23,319
We almost got caught, didn't we?

654
00:48:24,654 --> 00:48:26,698
Let's just tell them we're dating.

655
00:48:26,781 --> 00:48:28,283
What are we doing?

656
00:48:28,366 --> 00:48:30,660
It's not like we have anything to hide…

657
00:48:33,788 --> 00:48:36,332
Is my baby upset?

658
00:48:38,126 --> 00:48:41,379
If the guys find out,
they'll be so happy for us.

659
00:48:43,006 --> 00:48:47,052
And considering our age,
we can just get married right away.

660
00:48:47,135 --> 00:48:48,178
To be honest,

661
00:48:49,346 --> 00:48:51,222
I'd be fine with having a child first.

662
00:48:52,432 --> 00:48:55,643
Everyone's swamped with Jaehyun's election
and whatnot.

[Sungchan clicks tongue, sighs]

664
00:48:57,145 --> 00:48:59,814
Let's tell them about us
when everything calms down.

665
00:49:01,191 --> 00:49:03,985
Isn't it more exciting
to meet up in secret?

666
00:49:04,069 --> 00:49:06,404
Well, I guess it kind of is…

667
00:49:06,488 --> 00:49:09,574
So, what should we do now?

668
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:11,993
- Now?
- Yeah.

669
00:49:13,703 --> 00:49:14,871
- [chuckles]
- Right now…

670
00:49:16,623 --> 00:49:17,624
How about we…

671
00:49:18,917 --> 00:49:20,043
take a shower together?

672
00:49:20,877 --> 00:49:21,878
Together?

673
00:49:21,961 --> 00:49:23,129
- Well, damn.
- [laughs]

674
00:49:23,838 --> 00:49:25,090
You like that?

675
00:49:25,173 --> 00:49:28,468
- My goodness. You're so forward.
- What's wrong?

676
00:49:29,010 --> 00:49:30,637
You're making me blush.

677
00:49:52,909 --> 00:49:54,160
Where the hell is it?

[Haesoo] <i>I think it was a burglar.</i>

680
00:50:13,221 --> 00:50:15,223
No. Don't call the police.

681
00:50:15,849 --> 00:50:17,976
Taera, your leg is bleeding.

682
00:50:18,059 --> 00:50:19,602
How is this nothing?

683
00:50:19,686 --> 00:50:22,856
Sorry, I pushed the panic button
by mistake.

684
00:50:25,942 --> 00:50:27,610
Hong Taera is a fake?

685
00:50:35,827 --> 00:50:38,788
THE REAL HONG TAERA

686
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:03,063
One more round!

00:51:16,701 --> 00:51:17,869
[Haesoo] Taera.

688
00:51:19,537 --> 00:51:20,538
Hey.

689
00:51:21,206 --> 00:51:22,248
You see the news?

690
00:51:23,208 --> 00:51:25,377
How does it feel
to become famous overnight?

691
00:51:26,127 --> 00:51:27,837
[scoffs] Famous, my foot.

692
00:51:28,797 --> 00:51:31,925
My colleagues are asking me
to get them an interview with you.

693
00:51:34,427 --> 00:51:37,514
By the way, your friend
sent some photos to our station.

694
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:40,392
My friend?

695
00:51:43,728 --> 00:51:45,939
Do you remember someone named Sophie?

696
00:51:50,819 --> 00:51:52,487
Well, I'm not too sure.

697
00:51:53,196 --> 00:51:55,907
Oh, right. You lost your memories.

698
00:51:57,992 --> 00:52:00,245
She said she went to school
with you in France,

699
00:52:00,328 --> 00:52:02,205
and that you two were very close.

700
00:52:06,418 --> 00:52:08,169
Is this before the accident?

701
00:52:09,629 --> 00:52:10,839
I can barely recognize you.

702
00:52:11,798 --> 00:52:15,010
I had surgery because my face was
badly injured in the accident.

703
00:52:23,685 --> 00:52:25,395
[Haesoo, in French] <i>Is this Hong Taera?</i>

706
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:33,486
<i>We were close friends</i>
<i>until she passed away.</i>

707
00:52:34,779 --> 00:52:35,822
She passed away?

708
00:52:36,573 --> 00:52:38,908
<i>Yes, she was in a serious car accident.</i>

709
00:52:38,992 --> 00:52:42,370
<i>She had several surgeries, but in the end…</i>

710
00:52:42,454 --> 00:52:45,415
<i>I felt so bad for her. She died so young.</i>

711
00:52:45,999 --> 00:52:47,459
Are you sure she's dead?

712
00:52:47,542 --> 00:52:50,378
<i>Yes, I even went to the memorial service.</i>

713
00:52:50,462 --> 00:52:53,715
<i>Yura's the only family she had,</i>
<i>so it was just me and her sister.</i>

714
00:52:56,343 --> 00:52:58,553
Do you, by any chance, know this woman?

715
00:53:00,930 --> 00:53:02,599
<i>I have never seen her before.</i>

716
00:53:03,141 --> 00:53:07,187
Apparently, Taera had plastic surgery
because she was injured in the accident.

717
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:10,023
Are you saying this isn't her face
post-surgery?

718
00:53:10,106 --> 00:53:11,399
<i>What do you mean?</i>

719
00:53:11,483 --> 00:53:15,612
<i>Taera wasn't just injured in the accident.</i>
<i>I saw her body at the memorial service.</i>

Chairman.

738
00:55:08,516 --> 00:55:11,186
You think deleting the files
will cover the secret?

I'm so sorry.

740

You sure nobody knows
what happened that day?

741

Are you certain?

[Red shrieks]

She's suffering from brain damage.
She's becoming more violent.

745
00:55:35,877 --> 00:55:38,088
I can't control her with medication.

746

<i>I don't think she'll last much longer.</i>

748

Absolutely not!

749
00:55:46,596 --> 00:55:48,932
Red has to be a perfect success.
No matter what!

I understand you received payment
from Assemblyman Ahn Seongmin.

753
00:56:04,114 --> 00:56:07,075
Did he ask you to check
if Red has a chip in her brain?

754
00:56:10,036 --> 00:56:11,371
Why did you do it?

755
00:56:12,789 --> 00:56:14,916
I was praying it wouldn't be one of us.

756
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,793
I'm so sorry, Chairman.

757
00:56:16,876 --> 00:56:19,462
My daughter's sick,
so I did this terrible thing.

758

I'm so sorry.

No, they're the bad guys.

760
00:56:24,634 --> 00:56:27,345
It's not your fault
that you're weak and powerless.

761
00:56:27,429 --> 00:56:31,182
I'll cover your daughter's entire
surgery and medical expenses.

762
00:56:32,308 --> 00:56:35,103
I won't even ask about your betrayal
against Hatch.

763

In return, do us a favor.

No, this is an order.

765

I'll do whatever you need, Chairman.
Just say the word.

Kill Red.

With your own hands.

Someone killed Red.

She didn't die from side effects
from the smart patch. She was killed.

770

No one else can know the truth.

No one.

772
00:57:23,693 --> 00:57:27,322
Only Director Koo and I have access
to the confidential files anyway.

773
00:57:27,405 --> 00:57:29,783
He's never logged in since Red died.

774
00:57:30,492 --> 00:57:32,952
Nobody will suspect
side effects from the patch--

775
00:57:38,166 --> 00:57:39,709
Red's experiment was a success.

776
00:57:40,293 --> 00:57:41,795
There were no side effects.

777
00:57:43,046 --> 00:57:44,172

00:59:09,924 --> 00:59:12,260
I told you he had dirty tricks
up his sleeve.

783

Now do you see Pyo Jaehyun's true colors?

784
00:59:22,103 --> 00:59:25,398
Perhaps, he's much more frightening
than we'd imagined.

785
00:59:57,263 --> 00:59:59,724
[doctor] Good thing we had a sample made
from before.
