Mr. Jo says there are no records

He says you may go.

[sighs] Where is Mr. Jo right now?

63
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:28,049
An urgent matter came up.
He had to leave quickly.

00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:30,593
What about the director?
I'd like to meet her.

00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:36,117
How did No. 50's photo
end up in Ko Haesoo's hands?

77
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:40,455
She said she received a tip-off
that she'd find her here.

78
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:47,087
No. 50 is already dead.

Fifteen years ago, at that.

Find out who the source is

I'll find out right away.

It can't be.

Please be specific as to what's happened.

Are there any complications
to Red's health?

00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,471
Has there been a side effect?

104
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:23,600
We at Hatch will make
our official statement shortly.

- This will get out soon.
- I know.

109
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:39,074
Once we find the culprit,
the police can handle the rest.

110
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:43,244
There's probably nothing on surveillance
since we were running a security check.

111
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:46,247
The schmuck who did this
knows our security system well.

Not well enough.

Am I really Hong Taera in these photos?

I think you definitely hurt your head.
I'll contact Dr. Kang.

You know I'm not Hong Taera.
Don't call me that.

They called me No. 50.

Why did I become Taera? Who is she?

148
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:08,556
Taera is my sister
who died in a car accident.

149
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:14,729
Someone needed my sister's identity
before we registered her death.

163
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:58,708
I was compensated very well,
so I turned you into Hong Taera.

Who paid you?
Who told you to do this? Why?

That was the agreement with my employer.

167
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:09,844
You fabricate my whole life,
and that's your explanation?

168
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:11,429
Why are you angry?

169
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:14,724
Were you ever miserable this entire time?

170
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:18,228
Korea's most successful man by your side,

171
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:21,815
living in the finest townhouse.
A life others only dream of.

172
00:16:23,108 --> 00:16:25,110
Now you have an adorable daughter too.

173
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:28,905
You're saying after all this time,

174
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:32,659
your kindness, affection,
and love for me were all an act?

175
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:37,247
You begrudgingly put on an act
because you were paid to do so?

176
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:40,375
Why does any of that matter right now?

177
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:46,506
Yura.

178
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,721
This is just a dream, right?

179
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:58,727
Tell me that I'm only dreaming.

180
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:00,979
[sobs] Yura, please.

181
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:03,398
Our relationship ends here.

182
00:17:04,149 --> 00:17:07,819
My mission was to care for you
until your memories were recovered.

183
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:12,907
Yura! Tell me.
Tell me who put me through this bullshit.

184
00:17:12,991 --> 00:17:14,284
[shouting] Who?

185
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:19,748
If your memories have returned,
now it's up to you to do the digging.

186
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:23,084
The one who set you up
to become Pyo Jaehyun's wife.

187
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,965
My relationship with Jaehyun
was a part of their plan?

188
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:33,762
Did you think it was pure coincidence
that a man of his caliber married you?

189
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:37,766
You wouldn't have stood a chance
if it weren't for me.

190
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:38,850
Why?

191
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:43,104
Why did you do it, if you knew who I was?

192
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:46,399
Jaehyun's done nothing wrong.
Have you no shame?

193
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:49,027
You shouldn't be wasting time with me.

194
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,738
You need to protect
your family you hold so dear

195
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:53,948
from the person who did this to you.

196
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:57,911
How would you feel
if your family were put in danger?

197
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:03,333
[breathes heavily]

198
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:25,105
It's me.

199
00:18:26,189 --> 00:18:28,024
Hong Taera came by just now.

200
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:29,109
It seems…

201
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:32,445
she's regained all of her memory.

202
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:34,948
Our deal's over, right?

203
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:39,119
The boss decides
when the deal is terminated.

204
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:41,329
You just do as you're told.

205
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,833
That's not what we agreed.

206
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:48,837
Taera's memories have returned.
What else is there for me to do now?

207
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:51,631
I can't do this anymore.

208
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:54,467
I don't need your damn money.
I have enough of my own.

209
00:18:54,551 --> 00:18:58,346
We know about your affair
with CEO Jang Dojin.

210
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:01,516
<i>Don't tell me you're in love?</i>

211
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:03,685
<i>That wasn't part of the plan, was it?</i>

212
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:07,522
What if he falls into danger
because of you?

213
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:10,984
No.

214
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,237
Leave him alone.

215
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,323
If you're worried about Jang,
you better do as you're told.

216
00:19:19,034 --> 00:19:20,535
We're at the final stage.

217
00:19:21,286 --> 00:19:23,079
After this mission ends,

218
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:26,041
you may safely return to France
with $2 million.

219
00:19:27,542 --> 00:19:29,336
Wait-- Hello?

220
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,171
Hello?

221
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:35,675
- Those sons of bitches! [pants]
- [phone clatters]

222
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:48,813
Run the print.

223
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:52,150
- Let's see who this bitch is.
- [agent] Yes, sir.

224
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:01,534
We have a match.

225
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:07,290
NO. 50, DECEASED

226
00:20:10,001 --> 00:20:11,503
How's that bitch alive?

227
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:13,922
[shouting] How?

228
00:20:17,676 --> 00:20:19,886
WEAKNESS: SISTERLY AFFECTION
FOR BROTHER

229
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:21,346
CHARACTERISTIC: TENACIOUS

230
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:35,402
[cane thudding]

231
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:42,492
Did you not confirm No. 50's death?

232
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:44,494
Yes, but--

233
00:20:45,203 --> 00:20:46,204
[grunts]

234
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:50,333
- You said she fell from a cliff!
- [coughing]

235
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:52,544
If I'm not mistaken,

236
00:20:52,627 --> 00:20:57,632
I remember you telling me
you saw her death with your own eyes.

237
00:20:57,716 --> 00:21:00,260
She was severely injured… [gasping]

238
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:03,388
…and there was no way
she could've survived that fall.

239
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:05,348
I presumed she was dead--
[breathes shakily]

240
00:21:05,432 --> 00:21:09,436
Her body-- I never found her body.

241
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:10,520
My apologies.

242
00:21:11,688 --> 00:21:12,897
Please forgive me.

243
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:16,818
[laughs]

244
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:21,281
How dare you give me a false report?

245
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:24,242
That bitch wasn't some mediocre shit.

246
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:27,537
She was the crème de la crème
of all my girls.

247
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,498
[stammers] Please give me one more chance.

248
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:40,592
That bitch came here with Ko Haesoo.

249
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:43,303
That wench

250
00:21:43,386 --> 00:21:46,264
exposed No. 50's existence to Ko Haesoo.

251
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:52,020
She's declaring war on us!

252
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:56,149
I guarantee you,

253
00:21:57,275 --> 00:21:59,444
I will kill her with my own hands.

254
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:00,862
No.

255
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:06,451
Bring her to me immediately.

256
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:10,997
I need to see for myself
how she's survived these past 15 years.

257
00:22:11,748 --> 00:22:14,334
[panting]

258
00:22:22,634 --> 00:22:24,928
I KNOW THE WOMAN
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR

259
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:26,346
Who could this be?

260
00:22:28,682 --> 00:22:30,100
Perhaps a whistleblower?

261
00:22:30,934 --> 00:22:33,103
We'll know when we see them.

262
00:22:33,186 --> 00:22:34,813
Something's definitely off.

263
00:22:35,814 --> 00:22:40,652
It's obvious Mr. Jo and
Director Kim Seondeok were avoiding me.

264
00:22:42,946 --> 00:22:46,366
Why did you go there on your own?
Why didn't you take me with you?

265
00:22:46,449 --> 00:22:48,493
Why don't you take me anywhere with you?

266
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:51,162
Who said I went alone? I went with Taera.

267
00:22:51,246 --> 00:22:52,539
If you went with her--

268
00:22:52,622 --> 00:22:55,458
I guess two women
could keep each other safe.

269
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:57,961
From now on,
I'm coming with, no matter what.

270
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:03,633
What are you two doing?
Check this out! Quick!

271
00:23:06,636 --> 00:23:10,765
Red, Hatch's emerging icon
and super chimpanzee, was killed.

272
00:23:10,849 --> 00:23:14,227
<i>The suspected time of death</i>
<i>was between 3:00 to 4:00 a.m.</i>

273
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:18,565
<i>A security officer at Hatch was arrested</i>
<i>as the prime suspect of the killing.</i>

274
00:23:19,107 --> 00:23:22,652
- Ms. Ko, do you know anything?
- <i>While the motive is still undetermined…</i>

275
00:23:22,736 --> 00:23:26,865
Did your husband happen to hint at
who was behind all this?

276
00:23:26,948 --> 00:23:30,410
This is an opportunity for us
to break an exclusive, no?

277
00:23:30,493 --> 00:23:34,247
This is a national crisis, sir.
Let's not stir the pot now, huh?

278
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:35,915
[journalist] If not now, when?

279
00:23:41,671 --> 00:23:43,465
INCOMING CALL
KO HAESOO

280
00:23:49,804 --> 00:23:51,222
No need to worry too much.

281
00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:55,685
We have the security footage and key card.
He'll fess up soon.

282
00:23:55,769 --> 00:23:57,687
It won't be enough to make him talk.

283
00:23:58,271 --> 00:24:00,065
We need evidence that implicates him.

284
00:24:00,148 --> 00:24:04,861
We're searching the suspect's call history
and bank statements.

285
00:24:05,695 --> 00:24:07,113
Oh, right.

286
00:24:07,197 --> 00:24:09,783
Your father must be concerned
over this issue,

287
00:24:09,866 --> 00:24:12,577
but please tell him not to worry.

288
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,704
- I'm counting on you, Chief.
- Of course.

289
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:16,706
[chief sighs, clicks tongue]

290
00:24:22,087 --> 00:24:23,171
[Jaehyun sighs]

291
00:24:23,254 --> 00:24:26,758
Haesoo just called you, right?
Are you going to call her back?

292
00:24:28,218 --> 00:24:29,719
[line ringing]

293
00:24:29,803 --> 00:24:32,806
Sungchan, check something for me.
Right now.

294
00:24:38,061 --> 00:24:40,605
Why doesn't she ever call me first?

295
00:24:41,356 --> 00:24:42,440
[sighs]

296
00:25:03,086 --> 00:25:04,129
[children chattering]

297
00:25:04,212 --> 00:25:08,133
Yes, ma'am. Jiu is having a great time.

298
00:25:08,216 --> 00:25:09,509
She's with her friends.

299
00:25:09,592 --> 00:25:11,428
Bring her home now.

300
00:25:11,511 --> 00:25:12,887
Now?

301
00:25:13,722 --> 00:25:15,640
So suddenly? Is something wrong?

302
00:25:15,724 --> 00:25:17,017
There's no time.

303
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,227
Right now, quickly.

304
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,770
Okay.

305
00:25:26,026 --> 00:25:28,361
Oh, what brings you here?

306
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,781
Jiu.

307
00:25:32,657 --> 00:25:34,617
- Auntie!
- Jiu!

00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:36,202
[laughs]

309

- Oh, Jiu, you're so heavy now!
- [Jiu laughs]

When did you get so big? [laughs]

[Jo] I didn't recognize you.

00:27:59,304 --> 00:28:00,930
Your face has completely changed.

Prosthetic ear.

339
00:28:13,568 --> 00:28:14,903
So you really are No. 50.

340
00:28:17,322 --> 00:28:19,366
You still have that look in your eyes.

341
00:28:20,367 --> 00:28:23,620
You've changed your name
and pretend to be a woman of class.

342
00:28:24,204 --> 00:28:26,831
Must have been quite fun
living the high life

343
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:31,586
with a successful husband
and an adorable child. [chuckles]

344
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,797
You are out of your league.

345
00:28:36,216 --> 00:28:38,426
You must have quite a story to tell.

346
00:28:41,304 --> 00:28:42,889
The director is waiting for you.

347
00:28:43,598 --> 00:28:44,808
Drag her out.

It would be easier on you
if you come quietly.

What happened?

364
00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:51,249
- Haesoo.
- What's going on?

365
00:29:51,332 --> 00:29:52,876
Everything okay, ma'am?

366
00:29:52,959 --> 00:29:54,044
Go and check inside.

367
00:29:56,129 --> 00:29:57,130
You okay?

368
00:29:57,922 --> 00:29:58,923
Try to stand.

00:30:01,593 --> 00:30:03,094

- Okay.

I don't think anyone's inside.

372
00:30:20,612 --> 00:30:21,780
I think it was a burglar.

373
00:30:21,863 --> 00:30:23,740
First, call the police
and check the cameras--

374
00:30:23,823 --> 00:30:25,825
No. Don't call the police.

375
00:30:26,743 --> 00:30:28,912
I just tripped.

376
00:30:28,995 --> 00:30:30,955
It's nothing. You can go now.

377
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:32,123
Ma'am?

378
00:30:32,207 --> 00:30:35,960
Taera, your leg is bleeding.
How is this nothing?

379
00:30:36,044 --> 00:30:38,129
It was an accident. It's no big deal.

380
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,091
Sorry, I pushed the panic button
by mistake.

381
00:30:46,805 --> 00:30:49,057
Strengthen security for all townhouses

Something's up, right?

386
00:31:10,453 --> 00:31:12,163
You left me at the hospital too.

387
00:31:17,335 --> 00:31:19,045
Something you can't tell me?

388
00:31:20,171 --> 00:31:22,549
There was an emergency at Yura's boutique.

389
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:24,551
I'm sorry.

Going somewhere?

Oh, that.

393
00:31:39,941 --> 00:31:43,737
I don't know what's going on,
but let me know when you feel better.

I'm always here for you.

You don't have to suffer alone, okay?

Hey, are you on your way?

400
00:32:17,354 --> 00:32:18,521
Okay, be there soon.

401
00:32:20,607 --> 00:32:24,027
I'm sorry, Taera. I have to go.

402
00:32:24,778 --> 00:32:27,030
I'm looking into
Hanwool Mental Hospital some more.

403
00:32:28,615 --> 00:32:29,783
Something's not right.

404

I'm sure they know who No. 50 is.

But they're hiding something.

- First, I'm going to meet Mr. Park and--
- Haesoo, I'm sorry.

407
00:32:37,374 --> 00:32:39,084
I'd like to get some rest.

408
00:32:39,626 --> 00:32:42,462
Oh, right. How inconsiderate of me.

409
00:32:43,296 --> 00:32:44,506
Get some rest, Taera.

410

Thanks for going with me today.

I love this place.

Is this the same person
who was adamantly against moving here?

00:34:03,668 --> 00:34:06,421
Dojin said you were against
living close to all of us.

427

But you know I'm not very social.

428
00:34:09,841 --> 00:34:11,926
Still, I think I made the right choice.

429

- Right?
- [Haesoo chuckles]

430
00:34:13,762 --> 00:34:17,057
We'll go through thick and thin here,
with our husbands and kids.

It'll be so much fun.

Taera, you're so sweet.

That's why I like you.

I can always depend on you.
I like hanging out with you.

Think of me as your older sister

[Jiu] Mom, why are you crying?

Jiu, you're home.

She called you several times,
but I don't think you heard, ma'am.

00:35:30,088 --> 00:35:31,089
Are you all right?

453
00:35:31,172 --> 00:35:33,717
Why are you sad, Mommy?

454
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,927
I won first place in the race today.

[sniffles]

456

My baby won first place?

457
00:35:43,768 --> 00:35:46,730
Mmm. I even got a sticker as a reward.

458
00:35:46,813 --> 00:35:49,482
Does that make you feel better, Mommy?

459
00:35:52,193 --> 00:35:53,278
It does.

460
00:35:54,237 --> 00:35:55,280
It makes me so happy.

461
00:35:55,363 --> 00:35:58,116
Then why are you still crying?

462
00:35:59,784 --> 00:36:01,119
Because I'm so happy.

463
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,789
Sometimes, you cry when you're very happy.

464
00:36:06,916 --> 00:36:09,878
You're prettiest when you smile, Mommy.

465

I'm done crying now. See?

466
00:36:15,342 --> 00:36:17,093
I met Auntie earlier.

Auntie?

468
00:36:21,264 --> 00:36:22,265
Where?

469
00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:25,393
She came to the kindergarten
with a present for Jiu.

470
00:36:25,477 --> 00:36:28,438
Auntie's going to France
for a business trip.

471
00:36:28,521 --> 00:36:31,483
She said, "Jiu, listen to your Mommy
and take care."

472
00:36:31,566 --> 00:36:33,777
And gave me this doll.

473
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,362
So cool, right?

474
00:36:35,445 --> 00:36:38,948
[Jiu laughs] Bang, bang.

Taera's sister is gone.
She's not at home or her boutique.

She already knew and ran?

477
00:36:58,802 --> 00:37:02,097
Keep a close eye on Ko Haesoo

They've increased security
around the townhouse,

so we won't make a move tonight.

482
00:37:14,401 --> 00:37:15,527
I promise you,

483
00:37:16,778 --> 00:37:18,488
I'll bring No. 50 back tomorrow.

484
00:37:19,155 --> 00:37:23,827
No. 50, that bitch, is Pyo Jaehyun's wife?

485
00:37:24,619 --> 00:37:27,997
Once again, she's no average bitch.

486
00:37:28,081 --> 00:37:30,000
She couldn't have done it on her own.

487

We can look into that.

488
00:37:35,213 --> 00:37:36,756
The question is,

489
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:42,429
why did she come to us with Ko Haesoo?

490
00:37:43,304 --> 00:37:46,016
Did she want to strike at me
with Haesoo as her weapon?

491
00:37:46,808 --> 00:37:48,518
Is this her revenge?

492
00:37:48,601 --> 00:37:50,687
Why would she do that after all this time?

493
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:55,692
She probably wants to find out
who wanted President Ko Taesun killed.

494
00:37:56,568 --> 00:37:58,486
Which we also do not know.

495
00:37:58,987 --> 00:38:00,989
Our client's information
is strictly confidential.

496
00:38:01,072 --> 00:38:04,200
I should pay Pyo Jaehyun a visit myself

497
00:38:04,993 --> 00:38:08,455
to find out exactly how much
he knows about us.

498
00:38:08,538 --> 00:38:11,124
What should I do about No. 50?

499
00:38:11,207 --> 00:38:13,084
Just kill her.

500
00:38:13,168 --> 00:38:15,337
She was destined to die anyway.

501
00:38:18,089 --> 00:38:19,257
[sighs]

502
00:38:24,304 --> 00:38:25,930
My name is Jung Yusun.

503
00:38:26,014 --> 00:38:27,932
I'm a charge nurse at Hanwool.

504
00:38:28,516 --> 00:38:31,811
Thank you for the note
and for your courage.

505
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,150
This is Reporter Park Junho.

506
00:38:37,233 --> 00:38:39,944
He's a reliable colleague,
so you don't have to worry.

507
00:38:44,616 --> 00:38:47,077
Do you know who this person is?

508
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:50,038
She was admitted to Hanwool
about twenty years ago.

509
00:38:50,121 --> 00:38:51,664
I treated her ear.

510
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,293
How did she get hurt?

511
00:38:56,044 --> 00:38:58,672
A feral dog bit her
when she was on the run.

512
00:38:59,172 --> 00:39:00,173
A feral dog?

513
00:39:00,256 --> 00:39:04,052
The hospital's been keeping feral dogs
in the annex building for a long time.

514
00:39:07,472 --> 00:39:10,100
[sighs] What was her real name?
The girl called No. 50.

515
00:39:10,183 --> 00:39:11,351
I don't know her name.

516
00:39:11,434 --> 00:39:12,977
But I remember what she looked like

517
00:39:13,061 --> 00:39:16,022
because she was brought in
with her younger brother.

518
00:39:16,564 --> 00:39:19,943
Her old chart is probably stored
somewhere in the basement.

519
00:39:20,026 --> 00:39:21,069
Shall I look for it?

520
00:39:22,904 --> 00:39:24,614
Why are you helping us?

521
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:31,913
Hanwool Mental Hospital
is not a good place at all.

522
00:39:32,997 --> 00:39:35,291
So many strange things happen there.

523
00:39:36,918 --> 00:39:40,338
If you're aware of that,
why do you still work there?

524
00:39:40,922 --> 00:39:42,424
We're not allowed to quit.

525
00:39:43,883 --> 00:39:45,301
Not until Director Kim lets us go.

526
00:39:45,385 --> 00:39:46,845
[Park] What do you mean--

527
00:39:46,928 --> 00:39:50,098
I'm working the night shift.
I'll meet you here tomorrow, same time.

528
00:39:56,104 --> 00:39:57,564
Can we trust her?

529
00:40:00,066 --> 00:40:02,360
At least she confirmed
that she knew No. 50.

530
00:40:02,861 --> 00:40:03,862
Let's trust her.

531
00:40:13,413 --> 00:40:16,124
Ms. Jung! Ms. Jung!

532
00:40:25,842 --> 00:40:26,843
Haesoo.

533
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:30,221
They're onto us, the people at Hanwool.

534
00:40:35,018 --> 00:40:36,019
[Dojin sighs]

535
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:39,356
Our stocks are dropping already.

536
00:40:39,856 --> 00:40:44,069
The press has started to suspect
that our smart patches are a hoax.

537
00:40:45,862 --> 00:40:47,697
[sighs, clicks tongue]

538
00:40:50,575 --> 00:40:51,618
[door opens]

539
00:40:53,703 --> 00:40:54,788
What happened?

540
00:40:55,914 --> 00:40:57,332
You were right.

541
00:40:57,832 --> 00:41:00,794
The suspect's skin cells were found
under Red's fingernails.

542
00:41:02,379 --> 00:41:03,546
The DNA results.

543
00:41:06,257 --> 00:41:07,258
Shit.

544
00:41:16,851 --> 00:41:18,520
Hey, you bastard!

545
00:41:18,603 --> 00:41:22,190
How much pain
my baby Red must have been in

546
00:41:22,273 --> 00:41:25,777
to leave such a mark on you
while she was dying!

547
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:27,362
Bring her back!

548
00:41:27,445 --> 00:41:30,240
Bring my baby back! My baby!

549
00:41:30,323 --> 00:41:33,326
We found your DNA
under the dead chimpanzee's fingernail.

550
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:35,412
- You still going to deny it?
- [Sungchan cries]

551
00:41:37,497 --> 00:41:40,625
I-- I-- I'm so sorry!

552
00:41:40,709 --> 00:41:42,627
Please forgive me. Please, just once.

553
00:41:43,628 --> 00:41:45,422
I never intended to kill her.

554
00:41:46,172 --> 00:41:50,093
[stammers] I was just trying to check
if there was a chip inside her brain,

555
00:41:50,176 --> 00:41:52,095
but the chimpanzee
suddenly ran toward me--

556
00:41:52,178 --> 00:41:53,304
Who made you do it?

557
00:41:54,556 --> 00:41:56,307
[breathes shakily]

558
00:41:57,350 --> 00:42:00,186
My daughter's surgery…

559
00:42:00,812 --> 00:42:01,938
I had no choice.

560
00:42:02,647 --> 00:42:07,777
Otherwise they were going to stop her
from getting a transplant. That's why--

561
00:42:07,861 --> 00:42:10,488
So who the hell made you do it? Tell me!

562
00:42:10,572 --> 00:42:13,616
Who the hell made you do this?

563
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:17,620
[breathes heavily]

564
00:42:18,705 --> 00:42:23,752
The leader of the Korean Democratic Party,
Mr. Han Kyungrok.

565
00:42:37,223 --> 00:42:40,226
[Dojin]
Hey, what the hell are you thinking?

566
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:43,480
If we expose Mr. Han's camp,
we can easily sway public opinion.

567
00:42:43,563 --> 00:42:45,148
So why are we covering it up?

568
00:42:45,231 --> 00:42:48,610
Once the guard pays the price,
they'll just sweep it under the rug.

569
00:42:48,693 --> 00:42:51,321
We know who our enemy is.
We can deal with it our way.

570
00:42:51,404 --> 00:42:54,032
Now is not the time to relax!

571
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:56,451
[sighs]

572
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:01,414
If Hatch is ruined because of this,
I'll deal with you myself.

573
00:43:01,498 --> 00:43:04,000
Talk to me
once something's actually happened.

574
00:43:05,335 --> 00:43:08,755
Hey. Didn't something
already happen though?

575
00:43:08,838 --> 00:43:10,131
Red.

576
00:43:10,215 --> 00:43:12,425
Red is dead. Huh?

577
00:43:13,343 --> 00:43:15,095
I'll take full responsibility.

578
00:43:15,804 --> 00:43:17,055
So don't worry and wait.

579
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:24,062
[sighs]

580
00:43:36,324 --> 00:43:37,701
[phone buzzes]

581
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:41,329
- Honey.
- Sorry I missed your calls.

582
00:43:41,413 --> 00:43:43,623
I was busy with the investigation.

583
00:43:43,707 --> 00:43:47,502
You must be pretty rattled.
Are Sungchan and Dojin all right?

584
00:43:48,294 --> 00:43:49,796
This is terrible.

585
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:51,631
It's all my fault.

586
00:43:52,215 --> 00:43:53,842
So many people are out to get me.

587
00:43:54,384 --> 00:43:55,802
Maybe I'm just a jerk.

588
00:43:55,885 --> 00:43:58,513
No, you're the sweetest man I know.

589
00:43:58,596 --> 00:44:00,724
So you were pretty worried about me.

590
00:44:01,516 --> 00:44:04,310
Don't worry.
Everything will fall into place. Trust me.

591
00:44:04,394 --> 00:44:06,688
Oh, I won't make it today,
so don't wait up.

592
00:44:06,771 --> 00:44:07,814
<i>Don't hang up, honey.</i>

593
00:44:08,523 --> 00:44:09,899
Honey, here's the thing…

594
00:44:10,608 --> 00:44:11,609
Jaehyun.

595
00:44:13,987 --> 00:44:14,988
It's just-- I--

596
00:44:15,071 --> 00:44:17,490
Taera, I'm sorry but I have a meeting.

597
00:44:17,574 --> 00:44:18,950
[sighs]

598
00:44:19,034 --> 00:44:21,661
I'm fine, so don't you worry
and get some rest. Okay?

599
00:44:21,745 --> 00:44:23,163
- Hold on!
- <i>Love you, Taera.</i>

600
00:44:23,246 --> 00:44:24,539
- Honey.

HAN KYUNGROK, PRESIDENT
ONLY FOR THE PEOPLE, NO. 1

606
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:24,766
Was Pyo Jaehyun supposed to be
a primary candidate of your party?

607
00:45:24,849 --> 00:45:26,059
[Kyungrok] It's just a rumor.

What's so great about a businessman
who makes a few bucks?

00:45:35,068 --> 00:45:38,071
We have more than enough
capable people in our party.

[all laugh]

614
00:45:40,073 --> 00:45:41,950
[Jaehyun] Politics is so dirty.

615
00:45:42,033 --> 00:45:43,952
- What's going on?
- Who's that?

616
00:45:44,035 --> 00:45:45,745
- What's he doing?
- What's happening?

617
00:45:45,829 --> 00:45:48,373
- What's he doing here?
- The Korean Democratic Party…

[reporters chatter]

619
00:45:50,208 --> 00:45:54,129
What about all the times you called like
a stalker to ask me to join your party?

620
00:45:54,212 --> 00:45:55,547
I'm disappointed, Mr. Han.

621
00:45:55,630 --> 00:45:57,966
I'm the one who's disappointed.

622
00:45:58,466 --> 00:46:02,303
Looks like you're here
to stir up some trouble. [laughs]

623
00:46:03,763 --> 00:46:06,057
Hey, get out of here. [stammers]

624
00:46:06,141 --> 00:46:09,728
I'm going to overlook
what you did to Hatch.

625
00:46:09,811 --> 00:46:12,480
It's not like you'd ever admit it.

626
00:46:12,564 --> 00:46:16,026
The man you used to kill Red
will be the only one to be punished.

[mouthing words] Get rid of him.

How dare you say such words
at a place like this?

629
00:46:21,156 --> 00:46:22,282
You out of your mind?

630
00:46:22,365 --> 00:46:24,826
Your chimpanzee's death
has nothing to do with us.

631
00:46:24,909 --> 00:46:27,370
Talk to the suspect.
You were betrayed by your own.

632

Get out of here!

- [crowd gasps]

- What?
- You arrogant bastard.

635
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:36,046
You've always been this way.

636
00:46:36,129 --> 00:46:39,299
Aren't you ashamed of using the innocent
to your advantage?

637
00:46:39,382 --> 00:46:41,843
He's blaming us without any evidence!

We will never tolerate such insults!

If you approach my people
and make them do such things again,

641
00:46:48,767 --> 00:46:50,435
I won't let it go so easily.

642
00:46:50,518 --> 00:46:53,146
You're taking this a bit too far,
Chairman Pyo.

643
00:46:53,229 --> 00:46:55,857
You're the one
who took it too far, Mr. Han.

644
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:59,069
Or should we explain how Red died
right here, right now, huh?

645
00:47:04,115 --> 00:47:07,952
I will make sure you pay the price
for messing with me.

646
00:47:14,793 --> 00:47:18,046
[associate groans]

647
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:21,508
<i>This is an offense and an insult</i>

648
00:47:21,591 --> 00:47:23,301
PRESS CONFERENCE
KDP TO SUE HATCH CHAIRMAN PYO

649
00:47:24,094 --> 00:47:27,138
<i>My fellow citizens,</i>
<i>we will never let this--</i>

650
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:33,978
Mr. Han has played a bad hand.
It's not like him.

651
00:47:34,062 --> 00:47:36,940
Jaehyun's refusal to join his party
upset Mr. Han very much.

652
00:47:37,023 --> 00:47:39,234
He's playing dirty to find his weak spot.

653
00:47:39,317 --> 00:47:41,903
What did Jaehyun say?
Will he run for president?

654
00:47:41,986 --> 00:47:43,029
Yes, I think so.

655
00:47:43,655 --> 00:47:44,864
You think so?

656
00:47:45,365 --> 00:47:47,575
Is that the way a CEO should be speaking?

657
00:47:48,243 --> 00:47:51,871
You've been friends for over 20 years,
and you still don't know how he thinks.

658
00:47:52,997 --> 00:47:55,625
So, anyway, what's happening to Hatch?

659
00:47:56,251 --> 00:47:59,546
Running for office doesn't guarantee
that he'll be president.

660
00:47:59,629 --> 00:48:00,714
We'll see where--

661
00:48:00,797 --> 00:48:03,591
Have you ever seen Jaehyun
start a fight he's not going to win?

662
00:48:04,801 --> 00:48:08,013
Don't you see that's why
you're always a step behind him?

663
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:12,726
If you don't think you have what it takes,
just come to Kumjo

664
00:48:12,809 --> 00:48:14,519
and start from the beginning.

665
00:48:14,602 --> 00:48:16,396
Whenever something happens at Hatch,

666
00:48:16,479 --> 00:48:19,524
Dojin is the one
who always takes care of it.

667
00:48:19,607 --> 00:48:21,484
Hatch needs Dojin.

668
00:48:24,654 --> 00:48:25,780
You're doing well.

669
00:48:30,035 --> 00:48:31,786
Father, Mother, good day.

670
00:48:32,328 --> 00:48:33,496
Have you eaten?

671
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:34,664
Yes, I have.

672
00:48:35,373 --> 00:48:37,667
You've lost even more weight.

673
00:48:37,751 --> 00:48:39,836
Are you taking the medicine
I gave you last time?

674
00:48:39,919 --> 00:48:41,379
Yes, Mother.

675
00:48:41,463 --> 00:48:43,256
Thank you for looking after Leo.

676
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:47,427
Instead of thanking us every time,
just move back home.

677
00:48:48,845 --> 00:48:52,766
No matter how hard you try to hide it,
it's obvious you grew up without a mom.

678
00:48:53,266 --> 00:48:54,934
[Dojin's mother] There he goes again.

679
00:48:55,018 --> 00:48:57,103
He loves having Leo over.

680
00:48:58,396 --> 00:49:01,066
Leo, Mom's here!

681
00:49:02,108 --> 00:49:03,443
Mommy!

682
00:49:03,526 --> 00:49:05,028
Careful, careful! [laughs]

683
00:49:05,111 --> 00:49:06,112
I'm fine.

684
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:08,615
Did you miss Mommy?

685
00:49:08,698 --> 00:49:11,451
- What have you been doing?
- Playing games with Uncle.

686
00:49:11,534 --> 00:49:14,871
- But I lost again.
- You did? [laughs]

687
00:49:16,247 --> 00:49:18,249
- Get home safe.
- [Dojin] Okay.

688
00:49:20,168 --> 00:49:23,505
Ms. Eun, please prepare lunch for Kyojin
with some pan-fried fish.

689
00:49:23,588 --> 00:49:24,589
[Ms. Eun] Yes, ma'am.

690
00:49:24,673 --> 00:49:26,132
You're eating with Kyojin?

691
00:49:26,216 --> 00:49:28,009
He's had a good appetite lately.

692
00:49:29,886 --> 00:49:32,222
[Dojin's mother] Oh, my precious Leo.

693
00:49:32,305 --> 00:49:34,766
- Come visit Grandma again.
- [Leo] Okay!

694
00:49:34,849 --> 00:49:37,227
[Dojin's mother] My sweetie. [chuckles]

695
00:49:44,984 --> 00:49:46,653
My game device. Hold on.

696
00:49:48,113 --> 00:49:49,864
Don't run. You'll hurt yourself.

697
00:49:51,991 --> 00:49:52,992
[Dojin sighs]

698
00:49:53,827 --> 00:49:57,956
How can you not even give me a call
when Hatch has turned upside down?

699
00:50:00,792 --> 00:50:01,793
Wait.

700
00:50:04,713 --> 00:50:08,591
That night, I took it too far. I'm sorry.

701
00:50:10,802 --> 00:50:12,053
No need to apologize.

702
00:50:12,887 --> 00:50:14,139
I understand.

703
00:50:14,222 --> 00:50:16,516
Makes sense for you to overreact.

704
00:50:24,941 --> 00:50:26,151
Give this to her.

705
00:50:26,234 --> 00:50:28,820
Tell her not to leave shit like this
at my house.

706
00:50:28,903 --> 00:50:30,739
She can tell me herself.

707
00:50:31,614 --> 00:50:32,615
You misunderstand.

708
00:50:34,534 --> 00:50:36,619
I'm always ready to let you go.

709
00:50:36,703 --> 00:50:37,704
[Leo] Mom!

710
00:50:40,123 --> 00:50:42,459
- Should we go home in Mommy's car?
- [Leo] Hmm?

711
00:50:42,959 --> 00:50:43,960
What about Dad?

712
00:50:44,461 --> 00:50:45,920
Dad's driving his own car.

<i>Come to the office as quickly as possible.</i>

Dojin was just here.

720
00:51:29,297 --> 00:51:33,510
He's been quite preoccupied
since the chimpanzee died at Hatch.

721
00:51:35,095 --> 00:51:36,096
Let's eat.

722
00:51:37,681 --> 00:51:38,807
It's tarak-juk.

723
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:41,351
[Dojin's mother]
You seemed to enjoy it last time.

724
00:51:42,102 --> 00:51:44,813
The fish was pan-fried and well-seasoned.

725
00:51:44,896 --> 00:51:45,939
Okay.

726
00:51:48,441 --> 00:51:51,194
I heard Jaehyun is running for president.

00:51:52,195 --> 00:51:53,279
[chuckles]

728
00:51:53,363 --> 00:51:54,447
Sounds like him.

729
00:51:55,323 --> 00:51:57,909
That only means
Dojin will have more to do.

730
00:51:57,992 --> 00:51:59,786
Stop worrying about Dojin.

731
00:52:00,286 --> 00:52:02,455
He can take care of himself just fine.

Please eat. I'll make you some tea.

I have something important to tell you.

You need

758
00:53:53,024 --> 00:53:54,526
to hear what I have to say.

759
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,246
Don't open the door for anyone
until I return.

760

Don't leave Jiu alone.
Please stay with her.

Can't I go with you?

I'll be back soon,

Don't go outside, okay?

I'm going to see Dad.

she better not do anything.
