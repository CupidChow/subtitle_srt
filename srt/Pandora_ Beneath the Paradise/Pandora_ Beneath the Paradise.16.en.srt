The photo…

11
00:00:31,904 --> 00:00:33,364
The photo.

12
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,961
My daughter…

13
00:00:47,795 --> 00:00:48,796
Jiu.

No.

15

No, it's a lie.

16
00:00:52,967 --> 00:00:54,719
Taera, stop fooling around and come out.

17
00:00:55,886 --> 00:00:57,346
I'm sorry. Please stop this.

18
00:00:58,764 --> 00:01:00,516
I'm asking you to stop!

19
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,185
Stop this and come out!

20
00:01:03,269 --> 00:01:04,562
Where are you, Taera?

21
00:01:04,645 --> 00:01:06,147
Where on earth are you?

22
00:01:06,897 --> 00:01:09,734
This is wrong! This is wrong!

23
00:01:09,817 --> 00:01:12,153
This is wrong! No.

24
00:01:12,236 --> 00:01:13,446
This is wrong.

25
00:01:13,529 --> 00:01:14,614
No.

26
00:01:14,697 --> 00:01:15,698
[murmuring]

27
00:01:15,781 --> 00:01:17,491
[bystander] How was he even elected?

28
00:01:17,575 --> 00:01:19,452
- [bystander 2] He's coming out!
- How scary.

29
00:01:19,535 --> 00:01:21,871
[bystander 3] Is he going to jail?

30
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,790
[bystander 4] He must be losing his mind.

31
00:01:25,374 --> 00:01:26,792
Where's Taera?

32
00:01:26,876 --> 00:01:28,461
Where'd you hide my family?

33
00:01:28,544 --> 00:01:31,255
Have you lost your mind?
You've never been married!

34
00:01:31,339 --> 00:01:32,506
What family?

35
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:36,385
You think I don't know what you're up to?
You think you'll keep her away from me?

36
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:38,846
Don't stand there. Take him away.

37
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:42,433
I'll find her, no matter what.
I will find her!

38
00:01:42,516 --> 00:01:46,228
I'll stop at nothing to find Taera!

39

You won't outsmart me!

{\an8}FINAL EPISODE

41
00:01:52,026 --> 00:01:55,196
{\an8}[judge] Defendant Pyo Jaehyun,
you orchestrated the Mokeum Temple bombing

42
00:01:55,738 --> 00:01:57,281
{\an8}by conspiring with Koo Sungchan

43
00:01:57,782 --> 00:02:00,826
{\an8}in committing premeditated murders
of human experiment victims.

44
00:02:01,327 --> 00:02:03,578
{\an8}You also abducted
YBC's Anchorwoman Ko Haesoo,

45
00:02:03,662 --> 00:02:05,080
{\an8}in an attempt to murder her.

46
00:02:05,622 --> 00:02:08,583
{\an8}Furthermore,
you are charged with malpractice

47
00:02:08,667 --> 00:02:10,835
{\an8}and embezzlement against Hatch.

48
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:16,424
{\an8}The defendant has been
found guilty of all charges.

49
00:02:16,508 --> 00:02:17,968
{\an8}The penalty is as follows.

50
00:02:18,969 --> 00:02:21,638
{\an8}Order. The Court imposes
on Defendant Pyo Jaehyun…

51
00:02:22,389 --> 00:02:23,682
{\an8}the sentence of death.

52
00:02:26,935 --> 00:02:28,436
[Jaehyun] This prick.

53
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,647
[prisoner 1]
The public is in shock yet again,

54
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:33,108
as more of Pyo's crimes continue
to be revealed.

55
00:02:33,692 --> 00:02:36,778
The gentle, handsome,
and youngest-ever president-elect.

56
00:02:36,861 --> 00:02:39,739
His hypocrisy is giving me the chills.

57
00:02:39,823 --> 00:02:42,367
I'm so scared, I'm all shivers.

58
00:02:43,201 --> 00:02:46,496
[prisoner 1] "I need to find my
missing wife Hong Taera, Your Honor."

59
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,748
"I need to find my daughter."

60
00:02:50,417 --> 00:02:53,253
You could be an Oscar-winning actor.

61
00:02:53,336 --> 00:02:55,505
- I almost went--
- Stop it, you bastards!

62
00:02:56,131 --> 00:02:58,091
What do you douchebags know, huh?

63
00:02:58,174 --> 00:03:01,428
How dare you raise your voice
before His Honor!

64
00:03:01,511 --> 00:03:03,263
- You have a death wish?
- Crush him!

65
00:03:06,016 --> 00:03:07,225
- Hey!
- You little--

66
00:03:07,309 --> 00:03:08,727
[whistle blowing]

67
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:11,438
[guard 1] What do you think you're doing?

68
00:03:11,521 --> 00:03:13,356
What the hell's all this?

69
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,483
[prisoner 2] We were just
practicing a play.

70
00:03:20,155 --> 00:03:22,282
They want to make me out
to be a madman, huh?

71
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:24,909
They're all in this together.

72
00:03:25,702 --> 00:03:27,662
She planned this with Haesoo and Dojin.

73
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:30,457
[prisoner laughs]

74
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:33,126
I'll find you.

75
00:03:34,044 --> 00:03:37,631
No matter where you hide,
I will find you, Taera.

76
00:03:39,633 --> 00:03:41,343
I will not die until I do.

77
00:03:44,471 --> 00:03:46,306
Inmate 930, you have a visitor.

78
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:55,565
[hoarsely] Relatively speaking,

79
00:03:55,649 --> 00:03:58,568
you're physically okay.

80
00:03:59,194 --> 00:04:00,195
As for me,

81
00:04:00,779 --> 00:04:03,490
my vocal cords were completely crushed.

82
00:04:04,574 --> 00:04:06,284
I can barely eat.

83
00:04:06,368 --> 00:04:08,286
Ms. Min really did that to you?

84
00:04:08,912 --> 00:04:10,121
Yes.

85
00:04:10,205 --> 00:04:15,543
I wonder why the cops can't even
catch a housewife like her?

86
00:04:15,627 --> 00:04:19,214
They'll catch her soon. There's nowhere
to hide in this tiny country.

87
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:20,799
Hey.

88
00:04:21,466 --> 00:04:22,551
I only did

89
00:04:23,219 --> 00:04:26,180
what you told me to do.

90
00:04:26,264 --> 00:04:28,266
Instead of you, I was the one--

91
00:04:28,349 --> 00:04:31,686
I was the one she assaulted,
you understand?

92
00:04:32,937 --> 00:04:34,021
What about Taera?

93
00:04:34,522 --> 00:04:35,523
Find anything?

94
00:04:37,441 --> 00:04:39,026
It just makes no sense.

95
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:42,238
She can't just disappear into thin air.
Not if everyone's in on this.

96
00:04:42,321 --> 00:04:46,659
The judge explained everything
at the trial, remember?

97
00:04:46,742 --> 00:04:50,871
- No such woman exists, damn it.
- You gonna be like this too?

98
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:55,418
Hey, are you also in on it?

99
00:04:59,922 --> 00:05:00,923
Hey.

100
00:05:01,424 --> 00:05:04,552
I heard you were making up shit
about having a wife and daughter,

101
00:05:04,635 --> 00:05:08,764
so you can reduce your sentence
by pleading insanity.

102
00:05:08,848 --> 00:05:10,808
You diligent bastard.

103
00:05:10,891 --> 00:05:12,351
Good luck to you, punk!

104
00:05:12,435 --> 00:05:13,519
Koo Sungchan!

105
00:05:13,603 --> 00:05:17,148
We lost to Jang Kyojin.

106
00:05:17,982 --> 00:05:20,735
Jang Kyojin won.

107
00:05:22,236 --> 00:05:23,446
What?

108
00:05:23,529 --> 00:05:26,657
The new chairman of Hatch…

109
00:05:27,575 --> 00:05:29,035
is Jang Kyojin.

110
00:05:30,244 --> 00:05:33,414
He changed everything about Hatch,
except for its name.

111
00:05:33,915 --> 00:05:35,041
What are you saying?

112
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:36,709
Jang--

113
00:05:36,792 --> 00:05:39,587
Jang Kyojin died in the explosion.

114
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:42,173
Stop it, you luna-- Ouch.

115
00:05:42,256 --> 00:05:43,925
[coughs]

116
00:05:44,008 --> 00:05:45,092
You lunatic.

117
00:05:45,885 --> 00:05:47,553
Thanks to you,

118
00:05:47,637 --> 00:05:51,432
my family and everyone associated with me
will be investigated by the prosecution.

119
00:05:51,933 --> 00:05:57,730
Let's for real never see each other again.

120
00:05:57,813 --> 00:05:59,440
Hey, wait, wait, wait!

121
00:06:00,483 --> 00:06:01,734
Okay, fine.

122
00:06:01,817 --> 00:06:03,194
Tell them I made you do it.

123
00:06:03,277 --> 00:06:05,571
Tell them you're innocent
and blame it all on me.

124
00:06:06,322 --> 00:06:09,700
But… do me one last favor.

125
00:06:12,536 --> 00:06:13,955
[prisoner] Oh, right there.

126
00:06:15,081 --> 00:06:16,666

Damn. This is driving me nuts.

162
00:08:10,821 --> 00:08:13,532
I'll ask the warden,
so get him to calm down at least.

163
00:08:13,616 --> 00:08:14,825
He has to survive.

164
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,461
[grunting and groaning]

165
00:08:48,901 --> 00:08:53,155
I hope you make it, Jaehyun.

166
00:08:58,536 --> 00:09:00,413
Attention. Inmate 930 is on the loose.

167
00:09:00,913 --> 00:09:03,040
You okay? Hey, wake up!

168
00:09:03,124 --> 00:09:05,293
[siren wailing]

169
00:09:07,837 --> 00:09:08,838
[chuckles]

170
00:09:14,594 --> 00:09:15,595
You did well, man.

171
00:09:15,678 --> 00:09:17,221
[breathes heavily]

172
00:09:17,305 --> 00:09:19,348
We don't have time.
Let's go to the townhouse.

173
00:09:34,697 --> 00:09:37,825
Koo Sungchan had no choice.
I threatened him to follow my orders.

174
00:09:37,908 --> 00:09:40,119
I am to blame for all his actions.

175
00:09:41,412 --> 00:09:43,456
- [chuckling]
- You satisfied?

176
00:09:44,165 --> 00:09:45,958
I had nothing to do

177
00:09:46,042 --> 00:09:48,711
with your jailbreak today, yeah?

178
00:09:50,212 --> 00:09:53,049
Our ill-fated relationship ends…

179
00:09:54,133 --> 00:09:55,176
[normal voice] …here.

180
00:09:55,968 --> 00:09:56,969
Goodbye now.

181
00:10:11,275 --> 00:10:12,276
Taera.

182
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,645
Jang Kyojin!

183
00:10:48,437 --> 00:10:51,023
- Pyo Jaehyun, you--
- You dare steal what's mine?

184
00:10:52,191 --> 00:10:53,985
What is this?
How the hell did you get here?

185
00:10:54,068 --> 00:10:55,695
Taera is mine.

186
00:10:55,778 --> 00:10:58,531
This is my house! It's mine!

187
00:11:00,074 --> 00:11:01,075
[No. 50] Stop it!

188
00:11:01,993 --> 00:11:02,994
Are you crazy?

189
00:11:03,494 --> 00:11:05,663
What're you doing, barging into our house?

190
00:11:05,746 --> 00:11:06,747
Taera…

191
00:11:07,832 --> 00:11:09,041
Honey, you okay?

192
00:11:11,168 --> 00:11:13,671
It's me. Don't you recognize me?

193
00:11:14,297 --> 00:11:15,339
Of course I do.

194
00:11:16,215 --> 00:11:17,842
The worst criminal there is.

195
00:11:17,925 --> 00:11:19,302
Did you escape from prison?

196
00:11:20,094 --> 00:11:23,472
What do you have against my husband
that you'd break into our home?

197
00:11:23,973 --> 00:11:25,099
Are you hurt, honey?

198
00:11:27,768 --> 00:11:29,186
But I'm your husband.

199
00:11:34,525 --> 00:11:37,570
You're doing this on purpose
to punish me, right?

200
00:11:39,071 --> 00:11:40,197
Right, Taera?

201
00:11:40,281 --> 00:11:42,158
Taera-- Taera!

202
00:11:43,618 --> 00:11:44,910
My name is Mun Hagyeong.

203
00:11:45,578 --> 00:11:46,704
Not Hong Taera.

204
00:11:49,707 --> 00:11:51,834
I despise people like you.

205
00:11:51,918 --> 00:11:53,252
You're creeping me out.

206
00:11:53,336 --> 00:11:54,712
Get out of my sight now!

207
00:11:54,795 --> 00:11:55,796
No!

208
00:11:56,589 --> 00:11:57,590
You're Hong Taera.

209
00:11:58,132 --> 00:12:01,010
You're my wife!
You're Pyo Jaehyun's woman.

210
00:12:01,093 --> 00:12:03,179
- What the hell are you doing?
- [Jaehyun] Get off!

211
00:12:03,262 --> 00:12:05,181
You're my woman.
You're Pyo Jaehyun's woman!

212
00:12:05,264 --> 00:12:06,682
Hong Taera. You're Hong Taera!

213
00:12:06,766 --> 00:12:07,767
[gunshot]

214
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:38,756
[gasps, panting]

215
00:12:52,853 --> 00:12:54,105
[sighs]

216
00:12:57,733 --> 00:12:59,610
[sighing]

217
00:13:01,696 --> 00:13:03,489
[footsteps approaching]

218
00:13:12,582 --> 00:13:13,583
You…

219
00:13:23,175 --> 00:13:26,887
"I need to find my missing wife,
Hong Taera, Your Honor."

220
00:13:26,971 --> 00:13:29,640
"I need to find my daughter."

221
00:13:30,224 --> 00:13:32,852
You could be an Oscar-winning actor.

222
00:13:32,935 --> 00:13:33,978
Stop it, you jerks!

223
00:13:34,061 --> 00:13:37,064
How dare you raise your voice
before His Honor!

224
00:13:37,148 --> 00:13:39,442
- You have a death wish?
- Crush him!

225
00:13:42,278 --> 00:13:44,363
- That's the president-elect.
- I know.

226
00:13:45,239 --> 00:13:47,074
[prisoner laughs]

227
00:13:50,036 --> 00:13:51,037
What's going on?

228
00:13:52,204 --> 00:13:53,205
Was it all a dream?

229
00:13:54,624 --> 00:13:57,126
[Kummo] Not too long ago,
you mocked me for being in here.

230
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:59,337
Let me look at you-- Oh, my.

231
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,838
[laughs]

232
00:14:00,922 --> 00:14:02,298
How unfortunate.

233
00:14:02,381 --> 00:14:03,925
You look just as terrible as I do.

234
00:14:05,551 --> 00:14:07,678
Call me crazy, go ahead.

235
00:14:07,762 --> 00:14:08,888
I don't really care.

236
00:14:09,388 --> 00:14:11,182
Have you actually gone mad?

237
00:14:11,682 --> 00:14:14,477
Why're you looking for a wife
and daughter you don't have?

238
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,437
The world may forget, but I remember.

239
00:14:17,188 --> 00:14:19,690
They're my family,
and she's the only woman I loved.

240
00:14:20,274 --> 00:14:22,902
I don't know what your sons did,

241
00:14:23,694 --> 00:14:26,322
but everything will return
to its rightful place.

242
00:14:26,405 --> 00:14:27,406
Look, look.

243
00:14:28,074 --> 00:14:30,326
You won't have the chance to do that.

244
00:14:32,161 --> 00:14:34,080
Your execution date is set.

245
00:14:46,509 --> 00:14:49,762
I thought capital punishment
was abolished in Korea.

246
00:14:49,845 --> 00:14:51,973
It's an executive order
from the president.

247
00:14:53,015 --> 00:14:54,600
Here are your keepsakes.

248
00:14:57,895 --> 00:15:00,022
BEST DAD AWARD

249
00:15:00,106 --> 00:15:01,232
[Jiu] Ta-da.

250
00:15:01,315 --> 00:15:03,609
<i>It's an award for</i>
<i>the best dad in the world.</i>

251
00:15:06,404 --> 00:15:07,405
Jiu…

252
00:15:12,868 --> 00:15:13,869
I'm not crazy.

253
00:15:15,413 --> 00:15:16,914
I'm not crazy!

254
00:15:16,998 --> 00:15:18,666
I remember them clearly!

255
00:15:18,749 --> 00:15:20,334
Both my daughter and Taera.

256
00:15:20,418 --> 00:15:22,003
Look at this! Look!

257
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,921
Jiu gave it to me,

258
00:15:24,005 --> 00:15:26,674
saying I was the best dad in the world.

259
00:15:26,757 --> 00:15:28,718
What'd you do to my family?

260
00:15:28,801 --> 00:15:31,137
I'm not crazy. I'm not crazy!

261
00:15:32,346 --> 00:15:35,016
No, no, no!

262
00:15:35,099 --> 00:15:37,810
I can't die like this!
I won't die like this! [grunts]

263
00:15:38,936 --> 00:15:40,938
[shouts] Help-- Help me!

264
00:15:41,022 --> 00:15:42,940
Please help me!

265
00:15:43,024 --> 00:15:44,358
Please help!

266
00:15:44,442 --> 00:15:45,651
[screams]

00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,783
[gasps, panting]

268
00:15:57,914 --> 00:15:59,123
What's going on?

269
00:16:06,297 --> 00:16:07,632
[Jaehyun] <i>Why am I here again?</i>

270
00:16:08,341 --> 00:16:09,842
<i>I clearly died a moment ago.</i>

271
00:16:12,428 --> 00:16:13,596
<i>How is this possible?</i>

272
00:16:14,513 --> 00:16:16,265
<i>Is time repeating itself?</i>

273
00:16:24,774 --> 00:16:27,151
[grunts, groans]

274
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:30,279
<i>Who are you?</i>

275
00:16:31,489 --> 00:16:33,366
<i>What did you do to me?</i>

276
00:16:48,297 --> 00:16:50,007
[groaning]

277
00:16:55,346 --> 00:16:57,098
[Kyojin] Your suffering has only begun.

278
00:16:58,266 --> 00:17:01,644
Many suffered and died because of you.

279
00:17:02,645 --> 00:17:04,605
It's time you experience the same fate.

280
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:19,684
Thank you, everyone…

281
00:17:20,894 --> 00:17:21,936
for coming here.

282
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,772
None of it's real, but he'll never know.

283
00:17:24,856 --> 00:17:28,234
He'll be looking for Taera and Jiu
in there every day.

284
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:31,905
He'll learn how agonizing it is
to be unable to end his own life.

285
00:17:31,988 --> 00:17:32,989
Ultimately,

286
00:17:33,531 --> 00:17:36,910
he'll be trapped inside the world
that he tried to create for himself.

287
00:17:49,172 --> 00:17:50,298
[grunts]

288
00:17:52,967 --> 00:17:54,260
[groans]

289
00:18:05,438 --> 00:18:06,439
You…

290
00:18:20,912 --> 00:18:22,997
We have to hurry. We don't have much time.

291
00:18:23,081 --> 00:18:26,793
This side effect from the microchip
will give him a 24-hour cardiac arrest.

292
00:18:26,876 --> 00:18:28,878
You have to get him out
within that time frame.

293
00:18:29,546 --> 00:18:32,006
[detective] He must be around here.
Search thoroughly!

294
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:34,175
[officers] Yes, sir.

295
00:18:39,639 --> 00:18:41,182
Over here!

296
00:18:42,141 --> 00:18:43,977
- Over here!
- Oh-- Over there!

297
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:46,062
- There they are!
- Are you okay, ma'am?

298
00:18:47,689 --> 00:18:48,690
He's not breathing.

299
00:18:48,773 --> 00:18:51,025
[detective]
Quick, call an ambulance. Come on!

300
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,320
I trusted him until the end.

301
00:18:55,655 --> 00:18:57,574
He's the father of my child, after all.

302
00:18:57,657 --> 00:18:58,825
{\an8}RECORDING

303
00:18:58,908 --> 00:19:00,034
{\an8}I was scared, but--

304
00:19:01,244 --> 00:19:04,414
I told him to apologize to the nation
and face the consequences…

305
00:19:06,207 --> 00:19:08,251
but he said he'd rather we die together.

306
00:19:10,545 --> 00:19:12,130
So I steered the car into the sea.

307
00:19:19,846 --> 00:19:21,097
What happened to Jaehyun?

308
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,613
You okay, ma'am?

309
00:19:43,912 --> 00:19:47,290
[Hagyeong]
<i>Don't worry. I won't kill you just yet.</i>

310
00:19:48,374 --> 00:19:51,794
My husband confessed
all of his crimes to me.

311
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:55,006
I'll testify to everything.

312
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,010
I'll provide all related evidence
at home and the campaign office,

313
00:19:59,511 --> 00:20:01,221
and give you full cooperation.

314
00:20:02,347 --> 00:20:03,348
In return,

315
00:20:05,016 --> 00:20:06,726
may I take his body?

316
00:20:09,687 --> 00:20:10,688
Despite everything…

317
00:20:13,066 --> 00:20:14,943
I want to give him a proper burial.

318
00:20:16,194 --> 00:20:17,237
As you wish, ma'am.

319
00:20:20,156 --> 00:20:22,450
[Haesoo]
<i>Pyo Jaehyun's officially a dead man now.</i>

320
00:20:28,414 --> 00:20:29,999
[groans]

321
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:33,461
[Kyojin] As time passes,
he'll experience more pain and agony.

322
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:35,839
It'll be more painful than death

323
00:20:37,131 --> 00:20:38,925
since Taera doesn't exist in that world.

324

Taera.

325
00:20:49,561 --> 00:20:50,562
I'm fine.

326
00:20:52,397 --> 00:20:54,274
I expected as much when I started this.

327
00:20:55,233 --> 00:20:56,234
This is…

328
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,028
the gravest punishment to Jaehyun.

329
00:21:03,158 --> 00:21:04,325
What about them?

330
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:10,957
Erase all the memories of Taera
in their heads, Kyojin.

[Hagyeong sighs]

[Kyojin] Jo's men
will turn themselves in tomorrow.

333
00:21:29,934 --> 00:21:33,313
I've programmed them
to confess all crimes related to Jaehyun.

334
00:21:34,856 --> 00:21:36,441
Thank you, Kyojin.

335
00:21:40,445 --> 00:21:41,529
I'm sorry…

336
00:21:45,074 --> 00:21:47,035
I was the only one who survived.

337
00:21:49,579 --> 00:21:51,039
I'm really sorry, Taera.

338
00:21:55,376 --> 00:21:56,377
How was Hajun…

339
00:22:01,633 --> 00:22:03,092
in his final hours?

340
00:22:14,938 --> 00:22:17,065
The doors are all locked.
They blocked the exits.

341
00:22:17,816 --> 00:22:18,858
What?

342
00:22:18,942 --> 00:22:21,194
There's an emergency exit. Follow me.

343
00:22:30,036 --> 00:22:31,454
Up there.

344
00:22:31,538 --> 00:22:34,165
There's a tunnel that leads to the sewer.

345
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:36,501
Hajun, come on.

You have to survive, Kyojin.

Hajun, we have to close this door
right now.

363
00:23:30,805 --> 00:23:33,057
Otherwise, the entire temple will explode.

Hajun!

365
00:23:48,198 --> 00:23:50,283
What are you doing, Hajun!

366
00:23:52,744 --> 00:23:53,786
Please…

367
00:23:55,788 --> 00:23:56,956
take care of my sister.

368
00:23:59,667 --> 00:24:01,586
You have to stop Pyo Jaehyun.

369
00:24:01,669 --> 00:24:03,087
Hajun, don't do this.

370
00:24:03,171 --> 00:24:04,797
You have to see your sister again!

371
00:24:04,881 --> 00:24:06,549
Open the door, Hajun!

372
00:24:27,779 --> 00:24:30,073
I should've gotten him out somehow.

373
00:24:33,201 --> 00:24:34,202
I'm sorry.

374
00:24:35,787 --> 00:24:36,955
I'm so sorry.

00:24:39,249 --> 00:24:40,583
I won't cry anymore…

376
00:24:43,837 --> 00:24:45,922
I intend to keep my promise to Hajun.

377
00:24:52,345 --> 00:24:54,138
I have to stay strong…

378

…cannot help but lament with the people

383
00:25:10,655 --> 00:25:13,283
who had high hopes
for the new administration,

384
00:25:13,366 --> 00:25:15,994
only to find ourselves devastated

385
00:25:16,077 --> 00:25:19,164
by the recent tragedy.

386
00:25:19,247 --> 00:25:21,332
The suspect Pyo Jaehyun may be dead,

387
00:25:21,416 --> 00:25:24,919
<i>but such a tragedy must be prevented</i>
<i>from ever happening again.</i>

388
00:25:25,003 --> 00:25:28,506
<i>A special investigations unit</i>
<i>will be assigned</i>

389
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:31,885
<i>to shed light to every bit of the truth.</i>

390
00:25:31,968 --> 00:25:34,429
- You don't have the right.
- The right of representation!

391
00:25:35,013 --> 00:25:38,683
[Jo] Mr. Uhm had evidence
implicating Pyo's crimes.

392
00:25:38,766 --> 00:25:42,103
That's why he ordered me to steal them
and have Mr. Uhm killed.

393
00:25:43,771 --> 00:25:44,772
Who did?

394
00:25:45,398 --> 00:25:46,399
Pyo Jaehyun?

395
00:25:47,233 --> 00:25:48,234
Yes.

396
00:25:48,318 --> 00:25:51,571
I monitored Hong Taera 24-7
under Pyo Jaehyun's orders.

397
00:25:52,197 --> 00:25:54,491
I reported who she met with,

398
00:25:54,574 --> 00:25:56,534
and I wiretapped her phone.

399
00:25:58,495 --> 00:26:00,413
Pyo's obsession with his wife

400
00:26:01,372 --> 00:26:02,707
was pathological.

401
00:26:04,667 --> 00:26:06,794
I'm Pyo Jaehyun's wife, Hong Taera.

402
00:26:08,379 --> 00:26:12,258
I'd like to express my deepest apologies
to the nation.

403
00:26:13,051 --> 00:26:14,886
Without knowing the truth,

404
00:26:15,386 --> 00:26:18,598
I helped my husband lead
his shameful election campaign.

405
00:26:20,099 --> 00:26:23,436
I never would've imagined
that he'd implanted

406
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:26,523
a microchip in my head.

407
00:26:27,732 --> 00:26:32,612
The microchip in Ms. Hong's neck
is identical to those of the victims

408
00:26:32,695 --> 00:26:34,948
of the president-elect's
illegal human experiments.

409
00:26:35,031 --> 00:26:38,368
Which means she, too,
was just another victim of his.

410
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,162
Mr. Pyo manipulated his wife's memories

411
00:26:41,246 --> 00:26:45,333
to make her completely devoted to him.

412
00:26:45,917 --> 00:26:49,003
[Dr. Kang] <i>It's true that I'd</i>
<i>given medication to Ms. Hong for 15 years,</i>

413
00:26:49,087 --> 00:26:52,173
so as to prevent her
from regaining her memories.

414
00:26:52,257 --> 00:26:53,925
I was just following Pyo's orders.

415
00:26:54,008 --> 00:26:55,051
I'm sorry.

416
00:26:55,134 --> 00:26:58,054
- Coming through.
- Another question, Dr. Kang!

417
00:26:58,137 --> 00:27:02,225
Is it true your identity as Hong Taera
was also fabricated by Pyo Jaehyun?

418
00:27:02,976 --> 00:27:07,522
Yes. That's why, going forward,
I wish to abandon that name

419
00:27:08,606 --> 00:27:10,567
and live by my real name.

420
00:27:12,235 --> 00:27:15,280
I humbly ask of the people of Korea:

421
00:27:17,198 --> 00:27:19,325
you may remember Pyo's crimes forever…

422
00:27:21,911 --> 00:27:23,371
but please spare my daughter…

423
00:27:26,583 --> 00:27:29,377
from living in the shadow
of her parents' crimes.

424
00:27:31,754 --> 00:27:33,214
Whenever I imagine

425
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:36,176
the shock
and the hurt she'll experience…

426
00:27:46,436 --> 00:27:47,896
I earnestly request this

427
00:27:49,564 --> 00:27:51,024
as the mother of my child.

428
00:28:00,658 --> 00:28:02,744
[Hagyeong]
You think the nation will spare us?

429
00:28:03,244 --> 00:28:06,122
Everyone now knows
what you had to live with.

430
00:28:06,873 --> 00:28:09,501
How Jaehyun controlled your life

431
00:28:09,584 --> 00:28:11,669
and how much you suffered because of him.

432
00:28:13,046 --> 00:28:14,756
People are rooting for you,

433
00:28:14,839 --> 00:28:17,258
so you may as well
live happily as Mun Hagyeong.

434
00:28:20,053 --> 00:28:21,262
Thank you, Haesoo.

435
00:28:21,346 --> 00:28:22,597
It's all thanks to you.

Yes.

438
00:28:26,726 --> 00:28:29,479
Dojin arranged for me
to get the chip removal surgery there.

439
00:28:30,522 --> 00:28:32,440
So I won't be seeing you for a while.

440
00:28:34,818 --> 00:28:35,860
Promise me this.

441
00:28:37,195 --> 00:28:39,989
Forget all the nightmares
you experienced here.

442
00:28:42,742 --> 00:28:44,410
And also how I mistreated you.

443
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:48,790
Let's meet again
with smiles on our faces, Taera.

444
00:28:56,548 --> 00:29:00,385
I'm so thankful that you came
into my life, Haesoo.

445
00:29:04,097 --> 00:29:05,098
Me too.

[Dojin] Taera.

00:29:13,273 --> 00:29:15,191
Right, it's Mun Hagyeong.

448
00:29:15,775 --> 00:29:17,735
Sorry, I'm not used to that name yet.

449

It'll take time. It's fine.

450
00:29:19,779 --> 00:29:21,948
Here are your new passports.

451
00:29:22,031 --> 00:29:24,242
I got Jiu's passport with a new name too.

452
00:29:37,005 --> 00:29:39,924
We'll take you to Switzerland
on Kumjo's private jet.

453
00:29:40,008 --> 00:29:42,844
You'll fly early in the morning
to avoid any attention.

454
00:29:44,304 --> 00:29:46,139
Thank you so much, Dojin.

455
00:29:46,222 --> 00:29:48,099
We're leaving in 30 minutes. See you soon.

456
00:29:54,814 --> 00:29:56,733
What's happening with you two?

457
00:30:06,701 --> 00:30:07,744
Jiu!

458
00:30:07,827 --> 00:30:10,121
Mommy!

459
00:30:12,582 --> 00:30:14,501
I hope you didn't cry
because you missed me.

460
00:30:14,584 --> 00:30:17,754
Of course not.
I had so much fun with Emma.

461
00:30:17,837 --> 00:30:19,631
Right, Emma?

462
00:30:20,131 --> 00:30:22,592
[in French] Hey, you look well.
I guess everything ended well.

463
00:30:22,675 --> 00:30:24,636
Yes, it's all thanks to you.

464
00:30:26,262 --> 00:30:28,681
[in Korean]
Are you done packing for our trip today?

465
00:30:28,765 --> 00:30:30,475
Yes. But where's Dad?

466
00:30:30,975 --> 00:30:32,101
Isn't he going?

467
00:30:32,894 --> 00:30:35,313
He can't go.

468
00:30:36,189 --> 00:30:39,317
I thought it'd be great
if Dad became president, but I hate it!

469
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,694
He's always so busy, I can't even see him.

470
00:30:41,778 --> 00:30:43,905
But Haesoo is coming instead.

471
00:30:43,988 --> 00:30:45,198
Leo is coming with her.

472
00:30:45,281 --> 00:30:47,742
Really? When?

473
00:30:47,826 --> 00:30:49,661
I hope they come soon.

474
00:30:55,875 --> 00:30:59,963
[in French] Are you worried that she'll be
hurt when she learns about everything?

475
00:31:00,046 --> 00:31:01,631
That you might've gone too far?

476
00:31:02,465 --> 00:31:05,593
You did what you had to do.
One day, Jiu will understand that.

477
00:31:05,677 --> 00:31:06,678
[Jiu giggles]

478
00:31:06,761 --> 00:31:10,056
You're not alone in this. You've always
been like family to me, Taera.

479
00:31:19,983 --> 00:31:21,651
[in Korean] He refuses to see me again?

480
00:31:21,734 --> 00:31:23,653
Yes and also,

481
00:31:23,736 --> 00:31:25,113
he said to never return.

482
00:31:25,196 --> 00:31:27,031
He won't see you, even if you visit.

483
00:31:29,534 --> 00:31:32,203
Is my father doing well?

484
00:31:32,287 --> 00:31:33,621
He's doing too well.

485
00:31:33,705 --> 00:31:36,583
Instead of repenting,
he's about to become the boss in here.

486
00:31:37,292 --> 00:31:38,293
What?

487
00:31:43,131 --> 00:31:45,884
[prisoner] Wow, Chairman.
Your appetite is as great as usual.

488
00:31:46,467 --> 00:31:48,511
Look how eagerly he's eating.

489
00:31:52,348 --> 00:31:55,727
This murderer wants to live until
he's old enough to shit himself.

490
00:31:56,394 --> 00:31:58,938
That's not fair, is it?

491
00:32:00,732 --> 00:32:02,400
[screams]

492
00:32:03,943 --> 00:32:06,446
Have you gone mad, you senile fool!

493
00:32:09,949 --> 00:32:13,286
How dare you. Shall I kill you today?

494
00:32:14,954 --> 00:32:19,000
Whether I kill you or not,
I'm a murderer all the same.

495
00:32:25,256 --> 00:32:28,259
I will be healthy and well
while I'm in here.

496
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:32,055
I must be punished for my sins
and fully serve my time here,

497
00:32:32,138 --> 00:32:35,725
if I don't want to be ashamed
to face my friend in the next life!

498
00:32:35,809 --> 00:32:37,185
So from now on,

499
00:32:37,977 --> 00:32:39,813
unless you're determined to kill me,

500
00:32:41,314 --> 00:32:43,149
don't you dare pick a fight with me.

501
00:33:02,585 --> 00:33:04,504
Haesoo packed you some food.

502
00:33:04,587 --> 00:33:07,006
She wanted me to tell you
not to skip any meals.

503
00:33:08,132 --> 00:33:09,133
Thank you.

504
00:33:11,052 --> 00:33:14,514
So, how did it go with Father?

505
00:33:16,516 --> 00:33:19,060
Maybe it's because
he doesn't want to apologize,

506
00:33:19,144 --> 00:33:20,895
but he refuses to see me.

507
00:33:21,646 --> 00:33:24,858
He should at least apologize to Haesoo.
Is that so hard?

508
00:33:24,941 --> 00:33:26,401
That's just who he is.

509
00:33:27,402 --> 00:33:29,237
He has trouble expressing his feelings.

510
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,072
I'm sure he feels sorry inside.

511
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:33,741
Kyojin.

512
00:33:34,701 --> 00:33:36,661
Why aren't you asking about Mother?

513
00:33:42,625 --> 00:33:44,377
The police are looking for her.

514
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,337
But it seems like Ms. Eun hid her well.

515
00:33:46,421 --> 00:33:47,964
They can't track her down.

516
00:33:48,047 --> 00:33:50,592
[Kyojin] I have no idea
why she's gone off the radar

517
00:33:50,675 --> 00:33:52,385
after what she did to Sungchan.

518
00:33:52,468 --> 00:33:53,636
She believes I'm dead,

519
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:56,389
but she still hasn't given up
on her greed.

520
00:34:00,727 --> 00:34:01,936
How's Taera?

521
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,354
She's leaving tomorrow, right?

522
00:34:04,439 --> 00:34:06,232
Tell her not to worry.

523
00:34:07,567 --> 00:34:10,320
Pyo Jaehyun is my cross to bear now.

524
00:34:13,615 --> 00:34:15,783
Oh, yeah, don't forget what you promised.

525
00:34:15,867 --> 00:34:19,245
If this job is too much for you,
quit immediately.

526
00:34:19,329 --> 00:34:22,916
None of us want to see you break down.
You know that, right?

527
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,502
I'll keep the promise. Don't worry.

528
00:34:50,318 --> 00:34:51,319
Have you seen her?

529
00:34:51,402 --> 00:34:52,737
[nurse] I don't think so.

530
00:34:52,821 --> 00:34:54,113
WANTED FOR BATTERY
MIN YOUNGHWEE

531
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:13,675
[sighs]

532
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,519
<i>We located Kyojin.</i>

533
00:35:27,689 --> 00:35:29,440
Where is he right now?

534
00:35:39,951 --> 00:35:41,327
Is that you, Dojin?

535
00:35:43,329 --> 00:35:44,330
Dojin.

536
00:35:44,414 --> 00:35:46,833
Great timing.
I had something to give Taera, so--

537
00:35:49,377 --> 00:35:50,753
[breathes shakily]

538
00:35:50,837 --> 00:35:52,547
How did you find me?

539
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:53,631
My baby.

540
00:35:54,215 --> 00:35:55,675
I knew you were alive.

541
00:35:56,176 --> 00:35:57,594
Thank you, Kyojin.

542
00:35:57,677 --> 00:35:59,762
Thank you for staying alive.

543
00:35:59,846 --> 00:36:01,472
Thank you, Buddha.

544
00:36:02,765 --> 00:36:05,101
Kyojin. Kyojin!

545
00:36:09,814 --> 00:36:10,982
What…

546
00:36:11,566 --> 00:36:13,151
What are these burn scars?

547
00:36:13,234 --> 00:36:15,945
Did you really survive that fire?

548
00:36:16,029 --> 00:36:18,781
Were you in that lab?

549
00:36:19,908 --> 00:36:22,494
Did you get treatment at a hospital?
Let me see.

550
00:36:22,577 --> 00:36:23,620
Get off me.

551
00:36:23,703 --> 00:36:25,455
Kyojin!

552
00:36:25,538 --> 00:36:28,124
Your son died at Mokeum Temple.

553
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:31,878
Kyojin, why are you doing this
to your mom?

554
00:36:31,961 --> 00:36:34,756
Everything-- Everything I did--

555
00:36:34,839 --> 00:36:36,216
It was all for you!

556
00:36:36,299 --> 00:36:39,552
Stop saying it was all for me, please!

557
00:36:40,386 --> 00:36:43,473
I abandoned you the moment I found out
you were working with Jaehyun.

558
00:36:44,098 --> 00:36:47,227
I can't watch you
become a monster because of me!

559
00:36:47,727 --> 00:36:48,937
Leave.

560
00:36:50,355 --> 00:36:52,607
Okay. I will.

561
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:55,109
But you should come with me.

562
00:36:55,693 --> 00:36:56,986
Let's go home.

563
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:58,321
Why would you stay here?

564
00:36:58,404 --> 00:37:00,073
We should go. Let's go home.

565
00:37:05,829 --> 00:37:08,039
That bastard is still alive?

566
00:37:10,959 --> 00:37:11,960
ERROR

567
00:37:12,043 --> 00:37:14,587
- Forget him.
- You…

568
00:37:15,421 --> 00:37:17,465
Are you…

569
00:37:19,425 --> 00:37:20,552
No.

570
00:37:21,302 --> 00:37:23,012
Don't get your hands dirty.

571
00:37:24,097 --> 00:37:25,265
I'll be the one…

572
00:37:26,015 --> 00:37:27,267
who kills Pyo Jaehyun.

573
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:30,311
- I will--
- Please stop!

574
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:33,731
Do you want me
to hand you over to the police?

575
00:37:33,815 --> 00:37:36,151
Go ahead. I will accept the punishment.

576
00:37:36,234 --> 00:37:37,902
I'll do whatever you tell me to do!

577
00:37:37,986 --> 00:37:40,446
But you can't stay here.

578
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:41,656
Come with me.

579
00:37:41,739 --> 00:37:43,700
Let's go, Kyojin.

580
00:37:49,581 --> 00:37:50,582
No!

581
00:37:57,463 --> 00:37:58,798
Mother!

582
00:37:59,465 --> 00:38:00,466
Mother!

583
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:02,385
Mother! Are you okay?

584
00:38:02,468 --> 00:38:03,469
Mother.

585
00:38:04,512 --> 00:38:05,972
Kyojin.

586
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:07,640
Mother!

587
00:38:07,724 --> 00:38:09,184
I'm okay.

588
00:38:10,518 --> 00:38:13,021
My son…

589
00:38:13,104 --> 00:38:14,814
My son…

590
00:38:15,899 --> 00:38:17,692
You're innocent.

591
00:38:17,775 --> 00:38:19,736
So don't hide.

592
00:38:20,278 --> 00:38:21,529
I'll…

593
00:38:22,197 --> 00:38:24,073
take your sins upon myself.

594
00:38:25,825 --> 00:38:28,536
My son is good. My…

595
00:38:31,706 --> 00:38:33,958
Mother, no. Please open your eyes.

596
00:38:34,626 --> 00:38:37,545
Please open your eyes.
You can't die like this, Mother!

597
00:38:37,629 --> 00:38:40,256
Mother! Mother!

598
00:38:41,257 --> 00:38:42,258
No, Mother.

599
00:38:42,342 --> 00:38:44,802
No. Please open your eyes, Mother!

600
00:38:44,886 --> 00:38:47,972
Mother!

601
00:38:53,561 --> 00:38:55,271
It's been exactly 42 days

602
00:38:55,355 --> 00:38:57,440
since our family ate together like this.

603
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:00,151
You were counting?

604
00:39:01,069 --> 00:39:03,029
Come on, it hasn't been that long.

605
00:39:04,697 --> 00:39:06,115
[Dojin chuckles]

606
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:09,369
Fine, come to think of it, maybe it has.

607
00:39:09,452 --> 00:39:10,662
My bad. I'm sorry.

608
00:39:15,208 --> 00:39:17,001
Hey, Leo.

609
00:39:18,294 --> 00:39:21,297
Your dad and I have something to tell you.

610
00:39:26,469 --> 00:39:29,806
Well, your mom and I

611
00:39:29,889 --> 00:39:31,808
are going to become friends now.

612
00:39:31,891 --> 00:39:34,352
Best friends, like you and Jiu.

613
00:39:40,233 --> 00:39:44,195
I'll probably have to move out.

614
00:39:44,279 --> 00:39:46,406
But…

615
00:39:46,489 --> 00:39:47,991
I'll come over often.

616
00:39:48,074 --> 00:39:50,618
You can see me whenever you want.

617
00:39:55,999 --> 00:39:57,250
Leo.

618
00:39:57,333 --> 00:39:58,459
I said I'm against it.

619
00:39:58,543 --> 00:40:01,421
I'm against you and Mom getting a divorce!

620
00:40:01,963 --> 00:40:03,965
Why don't I have any say in this?

621
00:40:04,841 --> 00:40:06,092
I'm sorry, Leo.

622
00:40:06,676 --> 00:40:10,805
But your dad and I
still love you very much.

623
00:40:10,889 --> 00:40:11,973
We're a family,

624
00:40:12,056 --> 00:40:13,558
and that will never change.

625
00:40:13,641 --> 00:40:16,895
I was so happy today

626
00:40:16,978 --> 00:40:19,147
because you two were friendly again.

627
00:40:19,772 --> 00:40:21,399
I hate both of you!

628
00:40:22,484 --> 00:40:23,860
Le-- Leo!

629
00:40:23,943 --> 00:40:25,028
I'll go talk to him.

630
00:40:26,446 --> 00:40:27,822
You've had a long day.

631
00:40:27,906 --> 00:40:29,115
Get some rest.

632
00:40:29,699 --> 00:40:31,409
- Are you sure?
- [sighs]

633
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:34,621
You'll talk to him tomorrow,
and the day after that, I will again.

634
00:40:35,622 --> 00:40:37,957
We'll beg for forgiveness
until our son feels okay.

635
00:40:38,791 --> 00:40:41,377
Hopefully, he'll forgive us one day.

636
00:40:42,879 --> 00:40:47,383
Okay, I'll keep asking for forgiveness
from Leo

637
00:40:48,134 --> 00:40:49,135
and from you.

638
00:40:50,678 --> 00:40:52,013
All of us

639
00:40:52,514 --> 00:40:54,516
will gradually find our places
in all this.

640
00:40:57,143 --> 00:40:58,520
Wait, Haesoo.

641
00:41:02,941 --> 00:41:04,317
Can I…

642
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:08,446
hold you one last time?

643
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,806
[sighs]

644
00:42:24,147 --> 00:42:25,398
Kyojin.

645
00:42:26,941 --> 00:42:28,026
Dojin.

646
00:42:29,694 --> 00:42:30,695
Mother…

647
00:42:32,739 --> 00:42:34,282
Mother passed away.

648
00:42:35,366 --> 00:42:36,367
What?

649
00:42:36,451 --> 00:42:37,702
What do you mean?

650
00:42:38,411 --> 00:42:39,913
She found me.

651
00:42:42,332 --> 00:42:43,333
But now--

652
00:42:43,416 --> 00:42:45,710
Okay, Kyojin. I'll be right there.

That bastard escaped!

656
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:53,968
He might go to the townhouse.

00:42:54,636 --> 00:42:55,637
Wait.

She's not done packing her things yet.

660
00:42:59,849 --> 00:43:01,100
You want to help her now?

661
00:43:01,184 --> 00:43:02,310
It's late.

662
00:43:03,728 --> 00:43:05,355
I won't be able to sleep anyway.

663
00:43:32,757 --> 00:43:33,967
Taera?

664
00:43:35,927 --> 00:43:36,928
Is that you?

Where's Mother?

679
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:02,067
Ms. Eun took her to Mokeum Temple.

680

She told me not to tell the cops
so things don't get complicated.

Do you think Mother is really dead?

What if she wakes up again?

Pull yourself together.

684
00:46:15,789 --> 00:46:18,208
Are you letting Jaehyun go?
You said it was his doing!

685
00:46:18,292 --> 00:46:20,336
She died protecting me.

She was trying to stop him.

Dojin, this is all that bastard
Pyo Jaehyun's fault.

It's all because of Pyo Jaehyun!

[shouts]

What?

692
00:46:39,772 --> 00:46:41,065
He wants Taera.

Haesoo is in danger.

694

It's all my fault.

I shouldn't have let him run away!

Let's find him.

We have to, whatever it takes.

Tell me how!

We can't even call the cops!
He's dead on paper!

Taera is our only way.

No, not her. Don't call her.

She's leaving the country soon.

You know very well what she went through
to escape Pyo Jaehyun.

I'm sorry, but I have to save Haesoo.

Jiu, you're going to have to leave
with Emma first.

Why? Aren't you coming?

712
00:47:57,016 --> 00:48:00,686
It looks like I need to get Aunt Haesoo
and meet you there.

713
00:48:01,395 --> 00:48:04,815
Auntie Haesoo? She's coming today?
Does that mean Leo will come too?

714
00:48:06,358 --> 00:48:07,526
I'll ask Haesoo.

715
00:48:08,444 --> 00:48:11,447
Go with Emma. I will catch up with you
in no time, okay?

716
00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:13,741
Promise me you won't take too long.

717
00:48:14,491 --> 00:48:15,492
I promise.

718
00:48:17,536 --> 00:48:19,371
Don't be sorry, Mom.

719
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:21,707
I'll stay strong and wait for you.

720
00:48:22,875 --> 00:48:24,251
I'm a big girl now.

721
00:48:25,628 --> 00:48:26,629
Thank you, Jiu.

722
00:48:28,422 --> 00:48:29,673
I love you, my daughter.

723
00:48:34,136 --> 00:48:35,346
Don't worry.

00:48:36,931 --> 00:48:38,891
Where do we need to go to meet him?

725
00:48:38,974 --> 00:48:40,726
Jaehyun has Haesoo's phone.

726
00:48:40,809 --> 00:48:43,103
There's a gun in my car,
in case we need it.

727
00:48:45,648 --> 00:48:46,982
It's Haesoo…

728
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:49,151
Haesoo, where are--

729
00:48:57,409 --> 00:48:59,161
Pyo Jaehyun.

730
00:48:59,244 --> 00:49:01,956
If you want to see me,
don't lay a finger on Haesoo.

731
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:03,457
I'll go to you.

732
00:49:04,416 --> 00:49:05,417
Where should I go?

733
00:49:08,921 --> 00:49:11,131
You can't go alone.
It's too dangerous for you.

734
00:49:11,215 --> 00:49:12,549
I have to go alone.

735
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:14,635
I'm the one Jaehyun wants.

736
00:49:16,637 --> 00:49:19,098
I'll save Haesoo at all costs.

{\an8}<i>Where are you, Taera?</i>

Taera.

00:50:13,777 --> 00:50:15,070
I missed you, Taera.

742
00:50:15,154 --> 00:50:16,822
Do you really want to kill Haesoo?

743
00:50:17,323 --> 00:50:18,324
Where's Jiu?

744
00:50:20,117 --> 00:50:21,368
Is she okay?

745
00:50:21,452 --> 00:50:22,703
Does she miss her dad?

746
00:50:24,913 --> 00:50:27,625
She doesn't know
what kind of man I am, does she?

747
00:50:29,418 --> 00:50:31,003
She has no idea I'm dead, right?

748
00:50:31,086 --> 00:50:32,963
Please let go of Haesoo first.

749
00:50:34,882 --> 00:50:36,467
I'm here.

750
00:50:36,550 --> 00:50:38,469
So you can talk to me, okay?

751
00:50:39,553 --> 00:50:42,431
Jiu thinks I'm the kindest man
in the world.

752
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:46,185
She always said I was the best.

753
00:50:50,314 --> 00:50:53,025
She can never know
what kind of man I really am.

754
00:50:54,193 --> 00:50:56,570
Pyo Jaehyun! Get it together.

755
00:50:57,279 --> 00:50:59,448
How heartbroken would she be if she knew?

756
00:51:00,282 --> 00:51:01,909
It's me you want.

757
00:51:01,992 --> 00:51:03,619
Hong Taera is the one you want!

758
00:51:04,828 --> 00:51:05,829
You're right.

759
00:51:07,539 --> 00:51:08,999
All I ever wanted was you.

760
00:51:11,251 --> 00:51:12,836
I wanted to be happy with you.

761
00:51:15,547 --> 00:51:17,299
When you look at me and smile…

762
00:51:20,052 --> 00:51:21,929
I'm so happy, I forget to breathe.

763
00:51:25,557 --> 00:51:27,726
That's why you called me here.

764
00:51:28,394 --> 00:51:30,437
At this very beach,

765
00:51:30,521 --> 00:51:32,606
you saved me from the brink of death

766
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:35,192
and turned me into Taera,
isn't that right?

767
00:51:35,276 --> 00:51:37,152
Then don't forget me, Taera.

768
00:51:37,236 --> 00:51:38,529
Please.

769
00:51:39,989 --> 00:51:41,365
Please don't forget me, Taera.

770
00:51:43,450 --> 00:51:44,493

Where is she?

[Haesoo] Taera!

00:51:52,835 --> 00:51:54,169
Taera, run!

00:51:57,464 --> 00:51:58,465
No, no!

00:51:58,549 --> 00:52:00,217
- [Dojin] Jaehyun!
- Stay right there!

777
00:52:03,762 --> 00:52:06,181
Don't do this, Jaehyun. Let go of her!

778
00:52:06,265 --> 00:52:09,435
Are you really going to kill her?

00:52:09,518 --> 00:52:10,894
The woman you love so much?

780

Haesoo.

781
00:52:16,609 --> 00:52:20,029
I'm so relieved that you're okay.

782
00:52:22,114 --> 00:52:26,493
I couldn't bear it
if something happened to you.

783
00:52:27,077 --> 00:52:28,078
No, Taera.

784
00:52:30,414 --> 00:52:33,626
Please spare Taera.
I'm begging you, please!

785
00:52:33,709 --> 00:52:36,629
Jaehyun, calm down and listen to me.

786
00:52:36,712 --> 00:52:38,589
I'll give you anything you want.

787
00:52:39,173 --> 00:52:40,466
How about you go abroad?

788
00:52:40,549 --> 00:52:44,053
Right, you can't live here anymore,
so let's go abroad.

789
00:52:44,136 --> 00:52:47,681
I'll set up everything for you,
so just don't hurt Taera.

790
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:54,480
You're all making me out to be
the bad guy here, aren't you?

791
00:52:54,563 --> 00:52:55,940
Just kill me, Jaehyun.

792
00:52:57,316 --> 00:52:58,817
That's what you want.

793
00:53:00,778 --> 00:53:02,363
You can't live without me.

794
00:53:03,739 --> 00:53:04,740
So…

795
00:53:08,035 --> 00:53:09,495
let's die together here.

796
00:53:10,788 --> 00:53:13,707
Taera! What are you saying?

797
00:53:14,333 --> 00:53:15,334
Jaehyun.

798
00:53:19,213 --> 00:53:21,298
Jiu will hate me if I kill you.

799
00:53:23,926 --> 00:53:25,219
Taera, am I…

800
00:53:27,638 --> 00:53:28,806
a bad guy to you too?

801
00:53:31,517 --> 00:53:32,518
What?

802
00:53:33,811 --> 00:53:35,020
I'm sorry it took me…

803
00:53:37,189 --> 00:53:38,357
so long to realize…

804
00:53:40,401 --> 00:53:42,695
what it means to live
a life you can't choose.

805
00:53:44,029 --> 00:53:45,030
I just…

806
00:53:48,158 --> 00:53:49,618
wanted to make you happy.

807
00:53:59,128 --> 00:54:00,337
I just wanted to see you

808
00:54:01,714 --> 00:54:03,590
up close for the last time.

809
00:54:05,175 --> 00:54:06,176
Hong Taera,

810
00:54:08,053 --> 00:54:09,054
the woman I love.

811
00:54:46,675 --> 00:54:47,676
Jaehyun?

812
00:55:06,195 --> 00:55:07,196
Taera!

813
00:55:38,727 --> 00:55:42,439
A FEW YEARS LATER, SWITZERLAND

814
00:55:43,399 --> 00:55:45,150
[Jiu, in English] Mom! Someone's here!

815
00:55:45,651 --> 00:55:47,194

816
00:55:48,362 --> 00:55:49,446
[in English] Welcome!

817
00:55:49,530 --> 00:55:50,531
[in Korean] Hey, Jiu.

818
00:55:50,614 --> 00:55:52,116
You love macarons, don't you?

819
00:55:52,199 --> 00:55:54,576
They're from the best confectionary
in Switzerland.

820
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:58,247
Vanilla, chocolate, raspberry,
and cream cheese.

821
00:55:58,330 --> 00:56:00,958
[in English] Wow! How did you know that?

822
00:56:01,458 --> 00:56:04,378
Mom, can I eat them with chocolate milk?

823
00:56:05,504 --> 00:56:06,922
Just for today, all right?

824
00:56:07,006 --> 00:56:09,049
Thanks, Mom. Love you!

825
00:56:10,884 --> 00:56:14,305
[in Korean] You're here early.
Haesoo and Dojin are coming later tonight.

826
00:56:14,388 --> 00:56:16,890
My business trip to Paris
ended earlier than I thought.

827
00:56:17,474 --> 00:56:19,685
I wanted to see you as soon as possible.

828
00:56:21,645 --> 00:56:24,481
What happened?
You don't sound like yourself.

829
00:56:25,065 --> 00:56:27,735
How was the chip removal?
Are you taking the pills?

830
00:56:27,818 --> 00:56:28,902
I'm much better.

831
00:56:28,986 --> 00:56:30,446
It's thanks to everyone.

832
00:56:30,529 --> 00:56:33,157
You must be tired.
I'll show you to your room.

833
00:56:37,411 --> 00:56:39,413
You and Dojin will have to share,
is that okay?

834
00:56:39,955 --> 00:56:41,665
Yeah, we're on vacation after all.

835
00:56:42,833 --> 00:56:44,084
Go ahead and unpack.

836
00:57:10,945 --> 00:57:11,946
[scoffs]

837
00:57:15,741 --> 00:57:17,201
[sighs]

838
00:57:27,169 --> 00:57:28,420
Oh, he'll need a towel.

839
00:58:27,393 --> 00:58:30,220
PANDORA: BENEATH THE PARADISE

840
