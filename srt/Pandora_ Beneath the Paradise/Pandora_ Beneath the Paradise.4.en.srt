So--

Don't think too much for the time being.
Let's just relax.

Just eat good food and go sightseeing.

Pleasure to meet you.

40
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,180
Here's a brief rundown of the itinerary.

41
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,307
Actually, we asked for two tour guides.

42
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,976
Yes, my little sister will be joining us.

43
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:48,914
Careful, over there.

44
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:52,084

[Haesoo] <i>Why? Why'd you save me?</i>

47
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:25,951
Did I ask for your help?
Why'd you save me?

48
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:28,871
Who do you think you are
to meddle with my life?

49
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:29,997
Are you done venting?

50
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:33,709
Have you no shame to all those people?

51
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:36,587
You don't have to thank me,
so just calm down.

52
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,964
"Thank" you? Are you delusional?

53
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,883
I want to kill you right now.

54
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,635
Just when I thought I'd find peace,

55
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:46,805
you pushed me back into hell on earth!
You hear me?

56
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:49,266
You could never understand my pain!

57
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:53,061
Why do I need to understand?

58
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:56,940
You think you're
the only one in hell on earth?

59
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:58,859
I lost both my parents in an accident.

60
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:03,405
I was in a coma for over a year. It's only
been a few months since I woke up.

61
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:07,951
It's as if someone cut all of my memories
out. I don't even know who I am.

62
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:10,162
My face and my name.

63
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:11,663
Everything feels foreign to me.

64
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:16,627
Every day is a nightmare
because of survivor guilt.

65
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:20,297
But I can't even express my misery
for my devoted sister's sake.

66
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:24,134
I do wish…

67
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,094
[scoffs]

68
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:28,514
I do wish I could choose to die like you.

69
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,601
But I have to live pretending

70
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:35,562
like everything is fine.

71
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:41,902
So what?

72
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:47,449
[sniffles]

73
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:51,453
You must have one, at least.

74
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,831
A reason to keep on living.

75
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:57,793
If not, find one.

76
00:06:57,876 --> 00:07:01,171
Find one at all costs, and live.
Just like everyone else.

77
00:07:02,965 --> 00:07:04,508
So let's choose life…

78
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:07,970
instead of death.

79
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:49,511

Come see us if you have any concerns.

then take Haesoo in as family?

[chuckles]

96
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:17,724
Manipulating his son's marriage is only
a game to him, if it's for Kumjo's sake.

97
00:09:18,517 --> 00:09:22,896
He probably made you Pyo Jaehyun's wife
to make you his ultimate weakness.

98
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:27,609
If what you say is true, the recovery of
your memories was all part of his plan.

99
00:09:28,861 --> 00:09:31,405
Oh, dear goodness.

100
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:34,867
It seems Ko Haesoo will die
by her in-law's hands rather than mine.

101
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:39,872
The more she digs into her father's case,
the greater the danger she's in.

102
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:50,174
It is possible that Chairman Jang
just might be waiting for exactly that.

103
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:54,720
You gave me quite the quality diamond
as an advance.

Was it really you?

112
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:42,017
Did you kill my dad?

113
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:46,438
How could you do this to me?

EXPERIMENT RED, FAILED

00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:48,458
I told you he had dirty tricks
up his sleeve.

118
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:52,629
Now do you see Pyo Jaehyun's true colors?

119
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:58,385
Perhaps, he's much more frightening
than we'd imagined.

120
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:00,679
Jae-- Jaehyun…

121
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:02,931
has never deceived me before.

Not once.

123
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:07,603
I should listen to what he--

124
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:10,731
[Kummo] He's a man of a honey tongue,
but a heart of gall.

125
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:15,444
He had Red killed and is shamelessly
using it for his little campaign.

126
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:17,362
He claims he wishes to benefit Hatch,

127
00:12:17,446 --> 00:12:20,574
but you and Sungchan are just blinded
by his words.

128
00:12:25,913 --> 00:12:27,206
This is your chance.

129
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,836
Take over Hatch, and bring it to Kumjo.

130
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:40,677
You've expanded it enough.

131

[door opens]

132
00:12:56,652 --> 00:12:57,653
Is Jaehyun busy?

133
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:02,282
What's with the long face?

134
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:07,746
You get a new side chick, huh? [chuckles]

[both chuckle]

139
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:39,736
Rumor has it that she's been top
of her class since the written exam.

140
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,990
It's all because I taught her the basics.

141
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:47,035
Ah. Okay, we get it. You tutored her.
Will you give it a rest now?

142
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:49,329
Honestly, thank you all.

143
00:13:49,413 --> 00:13:51,790
I made it this far with all your help.

144

Congratulations. I knew you'd make it.

147
00:14:02,176 --> 00:14:05,179
When did you come to Seoul?
How'd you know I was here?

148
00:14:05,888 --> 00:14:07,306
Did Jaehyun not say anything?

149
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:09,516
I'm going to live in Korea now.

150
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:14,605
Jaehyun helped me and Yura to relocate.

151
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,275
That's wonderful news.

152
00:14:18,901 --> 00:14:20,777
I missed you so much.

153
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:22,196
Let's be clear.

154
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:24,948
I'm older than you,
and I expect to be treated as such.

<i>She stayed close to me and fooled me</i>
<i>into believing she wanted to comfort me.</i>

162
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:11,036
[No. 50] <i>Why did Chairman Jang need me</i>
<i>after I lost my memory?</i>

163
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:13,789
<i>To keep tabs on Jaehyun?</i>

164
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:17,709
<i>But did he really need me</i>

165
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:19,670
<i>To torture Haesoo?</i>

[sighs]

168
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:28,303
[Jiu] Mommy.

169
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:31,473
[gasps] You're awake early.

170
00:15:31,557 --> 00:15:33,475
I had a weird dream.

171
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:35,853
You left me alone and went somewhere.

172
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:40,023
I called out to you,
but you wouldn't even look back.

173
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:41,775
That's a very odd dream.

174
00:15:41,859 --> 00:15:44,278
Mommy would never leave you alone.

175
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:47,447
I always answer you right away, don't I?

176
00:15:47,531 --> 00:15:50,826
So you're not going to leave me?

177
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:54,705
Maybe you're still a baby,
who's still afraid of dreams.

178
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:57,082
I'm not a baby. I'm a big girl now.

179
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,252
Big enough to resist tickles?

180
00:16:02,296 --> 00:16:03,672
[No. 50 gasps]

181
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:07,926
What was that?

182
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:10,596
You okay? Are you hurt?

183
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:12,097
- Jiu, you okay?
- Yeah.

184
00:16:12,848 --> 00:16:14,850
Darling. That's--

185
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:20,814
[lawn mower rattling]

186
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:31,200
[No. 50] Haesoo.

187
00:16:31,283 --> 00:16:32,826
[lawn mower stops]

188
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:34,745
Sorry about that.

189
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:36,705
I was clearing some rocks,

190
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:38,665
but I threw one your way by mistake.

191
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:40,542
Did I startle you?

192
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:42,836
What are you doing over there?

193
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,672
Taera made that garden for you, no?

194
00:16:45,756 --> 00:16:47,508
I don't want to look at it anymore.

195
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:51,094
The garden has flourished too much.

196
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:53,096
Something's not right about it.

197
00:16:57,601 --> 00:16:58,685
Is this okay with you?

198
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:01,063
[Jiu] Mommy.

199
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:04,733
Jiu, were you scared?

200
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:07,528
Auntie made a mistake. I'm sorry.

201
00:17:07,611 --> 00:17:10,405
It's okay. I was only a little scared.

202
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:14,451
- [steward] What is it, sir?
- It's nothing. We're good.

203
00:17:14,535 --> 00:17:19,540
Actually, could you mow the entire garden?
I don't want to see a single flower.

204
00:17:19,623 --> 00:17:20,832
[steward] Yes, ma'am.

205
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,677
Something's up with Haesoo, right?

206
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,470
Wonder what's happened.

207
00:17:33,554 --> 00:17:35,848
She was worried for you
just a few days ago.

208
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:38,559
She was?

209
00:17:38,642 --> 00:17:41,311
She suggested
we hire personal security for you.

210
00:17:41,395 --> 00:17:43,564
She may not show it,
but she cares about you.

211
00:17:44,606 --> 00:17:47,025
- I know.
- She relies on you a lot.

212
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:49,319
Take care of her. You know she has no one.

213
00:17:51,572 --> 00:17:54,783
I hope you've no other plans tonight.
I invited some guests.

214
00:17:54,867 --> 00:17:56,618
[cell phone buzzes]

215

[Sangbae]
<i>Chairman Jang would like to see you.</i>

216

[camera shutters clicking]

217
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,423
Grandpa, am I doing good?

218
00:18:10,215 --> 00:18:14,887
You're finally looking the part.
You look great. [laughs]

219
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,182
Pyo Jaehyun is here, Chairman.

220
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,685
Keep riding, okay?

221
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:26,690
Stop.

222
00:18:28,025 --> 00:18:30,402
Can't you tell I'm tired?

223
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:33,280
You should've let me rest already.

224
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:37,659
Coach Kim, what on earth
are we paying you for?

225
00:18:38,744 --> 00:18:40,454
My apologies. Duly noted, sir.

226
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:41,914
Bring it.

227
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,461
Man…

228
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:51,423
Now I'm finally looking the part.
I look great.

229
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:02,768
[Leo] Do we have hot cocoa?

230
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:10,692
[Jaehyun sighs]

231
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:18,617
[sighs]

232
00:19:19,243 --> 00:19:22,287
[Kummo] Power is a curious thing.

233
00:19:23,622 --> 00:19:27,376
Even the noble Pyo Jaehyun
falls prostrate before power.

234
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:31,797
You must be desperate to win the election,

235
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,050
if you're so willing to put
blood on your hands.

236
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:46,270
What a pity.
The nation will be in for quite a shock.

237
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:48,981
It was an inevitable decision
for Hatch's sake.

238
00:19:49,064 --> 00:19:52,901
Then, it's time to let go of Hatch.
Let nature take its course.

239
00:19:52,985 --> 00:19:54,278
Chairman.

240
00:19:57,489 --> 00:19:59,241
Take your hands off Hatch.

241
00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:03,287
Forget about having Dojin around.
You're not his friend.

242
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:06,665
Running for president? Sure, give it a go.

243
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:09,293
Why would I restrain
your juvenile bravado?

244
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:10,669
[chuckles]

245
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,881
No.

246
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:16,800
I'm not giving up anything.

247
00:20:18,552 --> 00:20:22,181
Just as you did 15 years ago,
I'm keeping everything of mine.

248
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,641
What?

249
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:26,643
I saw you.

250
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:32,274
How pitifully you pleaded
before the late President Ko Taesun.

251
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:38,447
[Kummo] What the hell is this?

252
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:42,534
The contractors have been selected,

253
00:20:42,618 --> 00:20:45,370
and you're pushing me out
of the Daehan Bridge project?

254
00:20:45,454 --> 00:20:47,748
It's a national undertaking of a lifetime.

255
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:53,754
You of all people know how hard Kumjo
Construction worked to win this contract.

256
00:20:55,172 --> 00:20:57,466
- [sighs]
- After your inauguration,

257
00:20:57,549 --> 00:21:00,886
I'll give you my full support
for your first infrastructure projects.

258
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:03,597
The construction will begin the day after.

259
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,349
If you're still unsure,

260
00:21:05,432 --> 00:21:08,560
I'm willing to call the executive team
to come in tomorrow, hmm?

261
00:21:08,644 --> 00:21:11,605
So they can brief you
on the construction plans once more.

262
00:21:13,941 --> 00:21:16,944
Is all this true?

263
00:21:19,238 --> 00:21:20,405
KUMJO GROUP
X-FILE

264
00:21:20,489 --> 00:21:22,616
Subcontracting corruption.
Fraudulent construction.

265
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:25,077
Plus, the cover-up of the death
of an on-site worker.

266
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:30,499
Am I seeing the true colors of a man
whom I call my best friend?

267
00:21:32,376 --> 00:21:37,172
The death report has been filed,
and compensation has been requested.

268
00:21:37,256 --> 00:21:39,216
And subcontracting corruption?

269
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:43,428
You say that because you know nothing
about the nature of this business.

270
00:21:43,512 --> 00:21:46,056
This isn't even worth mentioning!

271
00:21:46,932 --> 00:21:49,601
You're right. I've been too ignorant.

272
00:21:50,727 --> 00:21:52,479
So I plan on making things right.

273
00:21:53,397 --> 00:21:56,108
Soon after the inauguration,
prosecutors will visit you.

274
00:21:56,191 --> 00:21:59,027
The prosecutors? Why?

275
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:02,781
What has Kumjo ever done wrong?

276
00:22:02,865 --> 00:22:05,617
I'm holding back
only because you're my friend.

277
00:22:05,701 --> 00:22:07,452
You better cooperate with prosecution.

278
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:11,498
Taesun.

279
00:22:11,582 --> 00:22:15,502
Kumjo's survival depends on this project.

280
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,338
If everything ends well,

281
00:22:18,422 --> 00:22:21,008
we can cement our place
among financial elite circles.

282
00:22:21,633 --> 00:22:22,968
We're best friends.

283
00:22:24,136 --> 00:22:27,598
Isn't our friendship stronger than this?
Huh?

284
00:22:27,681 --> 00:22:30,601
I won't allow corruption
as long as I'm in power.

285
00:22:31,643 --> 00:22:33,604
Not even you can be an exception.

286
00:22:34,479 --> 00:22:36,857
This is how I'll protect
our friendship of 30 years.

287
00:22:40,485 --> 00:22:44,114
You think you won the election
on your own without my help?

288
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,952
You will regret this. Just you wait.

289
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:55,209
I'm the bastard…

290
00:22:56,919 --> 00:22:59,087
who always does what he sets out to do.

291
00:23:07,554 --> 00:23:09,223
[Taesun sighs]

292
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:18,982
- [Haesoo] Mr. Pyo.
- [Jaehyun] Yeah?

293
00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:20,984
- I solved the equations.
- Let's see, then.

294
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:37,292
Since when do we perceive
rusty old memories as the truth?

295
00:23:38,669 --> 00:23:40,754
That's what we call "memory distortion."

296
00:23:42,881 --> 00:23:47,177
After Haesoo's father passed,
the prosecution never pursued you.

297
00:23:47,261 --> 00:23:50,848
And Kumjo shot up in ranks,
becoming the third-largest in Korea.

298
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:53,141
Have I got it wrong?

299
00:23:53,225 --> 00:23:55,018
[laughing]

300
00:23:55,853 --> 00:23:57,646
Investigation by prosecution?

301
00:23:57,729 --> 00:23:59,731
That was never a thing.

302
00:23:59,815 --> 00:24:01,817
Kumjo was already on the rise.

303
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,819
We'd already expanded into sectors

304
00:24:03,902 --> 00:24:06,655
from production to distribution,
so that was a given.

305
00:24:06,738 --> 00:24:08,574
Would Haesoo agree with you?

306
00:24:09,825 --> 00:24:11,243
- What about Dojin?
- Why?

307
00:24:12,286 --> 00:24:13,620
Have they said anything?

308
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:17,249
When the late President Ko passed,

309
00:24:17,332 --> 00:24:20,419
you were the prime suspect
of his assassination.

310
00:24:21,211 --> 00:24:23,380
You know it's no secret.

311
00:24:23,463 --> 00:24:27,301
But the moment you took in Haesoo
as your daughter-in-law,

312
00:24:27,384 --> 00:24:29,344
you were free of all suspicion.

313
00:24:31,054 --> 00:24:32,055
It truly was…

314
00:24:33,932 --> 00:24:35,392
an excellent move.

315
00:24:38,937 --> 00:24:39,938
Their marriage…

316
00:24:41,607 --> 00:24:44,359
Did you really give your consent
solely for Dojin's sake?

317
00:24:46,236 --> 00:24:47,946
Is that what he still believes?

318
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:53,368
I have evidence,
but you're just running your mouth.

319
00:24:54,203 --> 00:24:56,079

Yes, Dojin.

Yeah, let's meet up.
I've much to discuss with you.

Oh, yeah.

"What a pity."

"the nation will be in for quite a shock."

Wouldn't you agree, Chairman?

You sure you were thorough?

I could actually get fired
if I do this without the boss' consent.

Yes, but I'm telling you it's not true.

She also said they kept feral dogs

You must be neck-deep

00:37:17,779 --> 00:37:22,117
It never occurred to us that she could
develop seizures from such stress.

482
00:37:22,201 --> 00:37:24,578
The smart patch we created was perfect!

483
00:37:24,661 --> 00:37:26,496
The smart patch was perfect?

484
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:29,958
You fool. We failed yet again.

485
00:37:30,042 --> 00:37:32,419
- Forget the second presentation--
- No.

486
00:37:32,503 --> 00:37:36,215
Red shouldn't have stood before people,
but the new presentation will happen.

487
00:37:36,298 --> 00:37:37,674
Sungchan, you can do it.

488
00:37:37,758 --> 00:37:41,136
The human patches were a success.
With your skills, we can--

489
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:43,555
Stop yapping, damn it!

490
00:37:46,975 --> 00:37:48,477
Wow.

491
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,355
What are you going to do
if something else goes wrong?

492
00:37:51,438 --> 00:37:53,315
You going to kill people too? Like Red?

493
00:37:53,398 --> 00:37:55,776
I almost started the human trials
because of you.

494
00:37:56,568 --> 00:37:57,569
I…

495
00:37:58,904 --> 00:38:00,989
don't want to make the same mistake twice.

496
00:38:01,073 --> 00:38:03,534
Variables? We're solely to blame.

497
00:38:04,451 --> 00:38:07,621
So just forget the human trials.
We can't go on like this.

498
00:38:07,704 --> 00:38:09,039
Then what about Kyojin?

499
00:38:10,249 --> 00:38:12,292
Are we just going to leave him like that?

500
00:38:14,336 --> 00:38:17,256
You really think I'm doing this
just to become President?

501
00:38:17,339 --> 00:38:19,466
Is that all I am to you guys?

502
00:38:20,259 --> 00:38:23,345
I don't care if I lose everything:
money or Hatch,

503
00:38:23,428 --> 00:38:25,138
as long as we can save Kyojin.

504
00:38:36,358 --> 00:38:37,359
[Kyojin] Everyone ready?

505
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:38,861
[Jaehyun] Of course.

506
00:38:39,361 --> 00:38:41,238
- All right.
- [Kyojin] Wow.

507
00:38:41,321 --> 00:38:43,323
You all look so determined.

508
00:38:43,907 --> 00:38:46,118
You know how competitive we get, Kyojin.

509
00:38:46,952 --> 00:38:51,373
I got the bikes fixed at the shop and
filled up the tanks with good fuel.

510
00:38:51,456 --> 00:38:53,292
I checked the radio too.

511
00:38:55,127 --> 00:38:56,962
Have you guys talked to Sujeong today?

512
00:38:59,131 --> 00:39:00,215
No.

513
00:39:00,299 --> 00:39:01,341
Why, Kyojin?

514
00:39:01,425 --> 00:39:04,219
I can't get a hold of her since yesterday.

515
00:39:04,303 --> 00:39:06,263
Man, I have a bad feeling about her.

516
00:39:07,764 --> 00:39:11,560
Well, it's only been a day, right?

517
00:39:11,643 --> 00:39:14,980
Well, I'm sure she has a lot on her plate
for personal reasons.

518
00:39:15,772 --> 00:39:17,524
- Let's go!
- Okay.

519
00:39:18,692 --> 00:39:21,028
[Jaehyun] <i>You're all onboard</i>
<i>with today's bet, right?</i>

520
00:39:21,612 --> 00:39:24,072
[Sungchan] <i>Whoever comes in last</i>
<i>takes full responsibility.</i>

521
00:39:24,656 --> 00:39:26,700
[Dojin] <i>In return,</i>
<i>take this secret to the grave.</i>

522
00:39:27,326 --> 00:39:30,245
[Kyojin] All right. Everyone, be careful.

523
00:39:30,329 --> 00:39:32,539
The roads are rough here on Mt. Hongak.

524
00:39:32,623 --> 00:39:33,916
[Jaehyun] Okay!

525
00:40:00,776 --> 00:40:03,111
[Jaehyun] Jang Dojin.
You fueled up on good gas?

526
00:40:03,195 --> 00:40:04,738
I feel like I'm flying.

527
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,450
[Dojin] It's a special gift.

528
00:40:08,534 --> 00:40:10,536
I'm going to beat all of you anyway.

529
00:40:12,704 --> 00:40:13,956
[Sungchan] Kyojin.

530
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:16,583
I'll show you what
"the student becomes the teacher" means.

531
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,421
[Kyojin] Everyone, focus!

532
00:40:28,762 --> 00:40:30,764
Hold on, the brakes aren't working--

533
00:40:34,226 --> 00:40:35,477
[Dojin] Kyojin, what's wrong?

534
00:40:36,812 --> 00:40:37,855
[Jaehyun] Did something happen?

535
00:40:38,689 --> 00:40:39,690
[Sungchan] Kyojin.

536
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:44,152
[Kyojin grunts]

537
00:40:44,236 --> 00:40:45,988
[Kyojin screams]

538
00:40:49,283 --> 00:40:50,617
[screams]

539
00:41:05,591 --> 00:41:08,594
If we hadn't gone there that day,
nothing would've happened to him.

540
00:41:09,595 --> 00:41:11,555
All because of that fucking bet--

541
00:41:13,473 --> 00:41:16,185
It drives me crazy, even to this day!

542
00:41:21,148 --> 00:41:24,109
Kyojin is like…

543
00:41:24,193 --> 00:41:25,194
our idol.

544
00:41:28,906 --> 00:41:31,408
If we don't help him now,
he won't last long.

545
00:41:31,491 --> 00:41:34,786
Without him, we have no research.
That's how much he means to us.

546
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:37,998
Shut it, you punk. You think you care
about him more than I do?

547
00:41:38,081 --> 00:41:39,708
Then stop making excuses.

548
00:41:40,417 --> 00:41:41,627
For your mother's sake.

549
00:42:00,479 --> 00:42:01,980
How was Mount Hongak?

550
00:42:02,856 --> 00:42:04,983
Did you find what you were looking for?

551
00:42:06,235 --> 00:42:07,236
[Kyojin] No, I didn't.

552
00:42:07,945 --> 00:42:10,280
I think I need to go one more time.

553
00:42:10,364 --> 00:42:11,782
What's on Hongak?

554
00:42:11,865 --> 00:42:13,617
What on earth are you looking for?

555
00:42:14,368 --> 00:42:16,620
Is it because of the accident that day?

556
00:42:17,246 --> 00:42:19,081
It wasn't just a coincidence, was it?

557
00:42:19,164 --> 00:42:20,832
Did someone try to kill you?

558
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,169
Please, please talk to me.

559
00:42:24,253 --> 00:42:26,922
What the hell happened that day, Kyojin?

560
00:42:28,048 --> 00:42:29,049
Is it…

561
00:42:30,467 --> 00:42:32,719
Dojin? Did he make you like this?

562
00:42:34,513 --> 00:42:35,514
Mother.

563
00:42:36,682 --> 00:42:38,475
Have you still not accepted Dojin?

564
00:42:40,269 --> 00:42:43,814
If you raised him since he was an infant,
he's your son and my brother.

565
00:42:43,897 --> 00:42:45,274
How can you accept him?

566
00:42:46,233 --> 00:42:50,654
Kumjo will be given to a boy whose mother
we don't even know. How are you so calm?

567
00:42:50,737 --> 00:42:53,240
- Mother.
- I don't trust him.

568
00:42:53,323 --> 00:42:55,993
How he hides his greed makes me
hate him even more.

569
00:42:56,076 --> 00:42:59,913
A man who covets your position
is neither your brother nor my son!

570
00:43:23,937 --> 00:43:25,189
Dr. Hwang is here.

571
00:43:27,191 --> 00:43:28,734
- [Dr. Hwang] Let's do a checkup.
- Yes, sir.

572
00:43:32,905 --> 00:43:35,532
[Younghwee] <i>I will put everything</i>
<i>in its rightful place.</i>

573
00:43:35,616 --> 00:43:37,576
<i>I'll never give up on you.</i>

574
00:43:41,622 --> 00:43:44,041
[chief] Have-- Have you lost your minds?

575
00:43:44,124 --> 00:43:47,794
Hanwool Mental Hospital
is threatening to sue us!

576
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:52,424
Didn't you know how close Kim Seondeok
is to political bigwigs?

577
00:43:52,508 --> 00:43:55,719
Why the hell would you cause
such trouble against the company?

578
00:43:56,428 --> 00:43:59,348
Chief, Ms. Ko said she'd take
full responsibility, right?

579
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:03,060
If you're taking full responsibility,
why are you staying quiet?

580
00:44:03,685 --> 00:44:07,314
Even if you get fired, you can live
as the housewife of a wealthy family.

581
00:44:07,397 --> 00:44:08,649
Do you even care?

582
00:44:09,983 --> 00:44:13,362
I'm aware of my mistake,
but what you just said is a bit harsh.

583
00:44:13,445 --> 00:44:15,239
I've never taken my work lightly.

584
00:44:15,322 --> 00:44:17,115
Want to see what harsh looks like?

585
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:20,452
Everyone submit a written apology
and take a six-month salary cut.

586
00:44:20,536 --> 00:44:22,955
And Ms. Ko, step down
from the 8 o' clock news!

587
00:44:23,664 --> 00:44:24,665
Chief!

588
00:44:24,748 --> 00:44:27,709
She'll get Hong Taera and Pyo Jaehyun
for the election special.

589
00:44:27,793 --> 00:44:28,961
- Right, Haesoo?
- Really?

590
00:44:29,586 --> 00:44:32,714
I heard they wouldn't attend
because his wife opposed it.

591
00:44:32,798 --> 00:44:34,216
No way. Ms. Ko made this happen?

592
00:44:34,842 --> 00:44:37,010
They promised to give her an exclusive.

593
00:44:37,594 --> 00:44:40,180
So can she stay
on the 8 o' clock news, Chief?

594
00:44:43,392 --> 00:44:44,685
Who asked you to step in?

595
00:44:44,768 --> 00:44:46,353
I'm not doing that special.

596
00:44:46,854 --> 00:44:49,356
Haesoo, can you give up
the 8 o' clock news?

597
00:44:49,439 --> 00:44:50,774
You worked so hard for it.

598
00:44:51,984 --> 00:44:53,402
You two are close.

599
00:44:53,485 --> 00:44:55,404
The press will be all over Taera soon,

600
00:44:55,487 --> 00:44:56,947
so it has to be an exclusive.

601
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:59,199
She's your only chance right now.

602
00:45:22,472 --> 00:45:23,849
Thank you, Pilseung.

603
00:45:23,932 --> 00:45:24,933
[Jaehyun] Where'd you go?

604
00:45:25,434 --> 00:45:27,519
Yura's boutique.
I had some errands to run.

605
00:45:28,437 --> 00:45:30,355
Why'd Yura go to France so suddenly?

606
00:45:30,439 --> 00:45:32,482
Isn't she busy with the boutique?

607
00:45:33,483 --> 00:45:35,485
- How'd you know?
- Jiu told me.

608
00:45:36,862 --> 00:45:38,113
Is something going on?

609
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:41,742
- [guest] Hello!
- [guest 2] Hi there.

610
00:45:43,827 --> 00:45:45,579
This is the campaign team.

611
00:45:45,662 --> 00:45:47,789
I wanted to introduce you to them.

612
00:45:47,873 --> 00:45:51,210
I'm Oh Yeongguk, the campaign manager.
Pleasure to meet you.

613
00:45:51,293 --> 00:45:52,377
Thank you.

614
00:45:52,461 --> 00:45:54,671
You are so much prettier in person,
Ms. Hong.

615
00:45:54,755 --> 00:45:57,466
You two will look great in pictures.

616
00:45:58,884 --> 00:45:59,885
What's going on?

617
00:45:59,968 --> 00:46:03,472
The team will be working here,
while we set up office.

618
00:46:03,555 --> 00:46:05,807
- At home?
- Yeah.

619
00:46:05,891 --> 00:46:07,351
[honking]

620
00:46:14,858 --> 00:46:18,195
- So he's…
- Oh, that's Mr. Bong.

621
00:46:18,278 --> 00:46:20,405
[campaigner] Geez.
So flashy. Gosh, so flashy.

622
00:46:20,489 --> 00:46:22,533
- Who's that?
- What a character.

623
00:46:22,616 --> 00:46:23,867
- Yeah, he's--
- Amazing.

624
00:46:23,951 --> 00:46:26,954
- He came all the way here?
- No way.

625
00:46:27,037 --> 00:46:28,455
- We're going to win.
- Really.

626
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:30,791
[in English] Oh, I'm sorry.

627
00:46:30,874 --> 00:46:33,335
[in Korean] How extremely rude of me.

628
00:46:33,919 --> 00:46:35,337
[in English] Please forgive me.

629
00:46:38,006 --> 00:46:40,217
[in Korean] Well, I'd say that you're…

630
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:44,596
the type of person who can stir
great passion from deep inside.

631
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:45,597
Okay.

632
00:46:46,098 --> 00:46:50,644
From now on, I will be arranging
everything for Ms. Taera with these hands.

633
00:46:50,727 --> 00:46:52,855
[in English] My name is Woori Bong.

634
00:46:54,064 --> 00:46:55,566
[in Korean] Or Bong Woori.

635
00:46:55,649 --> 00:46:57,276
You can call me Mr. Bong.

636
00:46:59,528 --> 00:47:00,946
- [Jaehyun] Thank you.
- Thank you!

637
00:47:01,029 --> 00:47:02,239
Your style is-- Oh!

638
00:47:03,323 --> 00:47:05,742
- Hello! It's been a while.
- [campaigner 2] Been a while.

639
00:47:05,826 --> 00:47:07,786
I never said I was going to help you.

640
00:47:08,453 --> 00:47:09,454
Taera.

641
00:47:10,122 --> 00:47:12,499
[Haesoo] Feels like a campaign,
Candidate Pyo.

642
00:47:12,583 --> 00:47:13,709
[Jaehyun] Help us out.

643
00:47:13,792 --> 00:47:15,377
Every vote counts.

644
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:19,798
Oh, my. Mr. Bong is taking care of Taera?

645
00:47:19,882 --> 00:47:21,717
I'm already impressed.

646
00:47:22,301 --> 00:47:24,803
Of course, pros recognize pros, right?

647
00:47:25,512 --> 00:47:29,266
We go to the same dermatologist.
That makes us friends.

648
00:47:31,268 --> 00:47:33,145
Sir, I have something to discuss.

649
00:47:33,228 --> 00:47:34,229
Excuse us.

650
00:47:37,482 --> 00:47:39,568
Looks like you're adjusting well.

651
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:41,987
Thought you didn't want this.

652
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:44,865
You can't possibly be dreaming
of becoming the first lady?

653
00:47:47,951 --> 00:47:49,995
You think you deserve to be one?

654
00:47:59,129 --> 00:48:02,382
Ko Haesoo knows that you're No. 50.

655
00:48:04,176 --> 00:48:06,261
You sure Haesoo knows about me?

656
00:48:06,345 --> 00:48:08,222
She ambushed us at the annex building.

657
00:48:10,098 --> 00:48:12,351
She even demanded that I warn you.

658
00:48:13,435 --> 00:48:15,812
<i>She clearly knows something.</i>

659
00:48:15,896 --> 00:48:17,689
She'll soon pose a threat to us.

660
00:48:17,773 --> 00:48:20,359
We have to get rid of her.

661
00:48:20,442 --> 00:48:23,237
What are you talking about?
You forget what I said?

662
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,863
Don't mess with Haesoo.

663
00:48:24,947 --> 00:48:28,283
When she finds out you're the assassin,
you think she'll do nothing?

664
00:48:28,367 --> 00:48:30,994
Your husband and daughter
may also be in danger.

665
00:48:34,164 --> 00:48:37,125
This may be what
Chairman Jang wanted all along.

666
00:48:37,918 --> 00:48:40,379
Having you get rid of Haesoo
with your own hands.

667
00:48:47,177 --> 00:48:49,054
[Haesoo] <i>Do you remember someone</i>
<i>named Sophie?</i>

668
00:48:49,721 --> 00:48:53,600
She said she went to school with you
in France, and that you two were close.

669
00:48:55,352 --> 00:48:57,104
<i>I don't want to look at it anymore.</i>

670
00:48:57,771 --> 00:48:59,690
<i>The garden has flourished too much.</i>

671
00:48:59,773 --> 00:49:01,733
Something's not right about it.

672
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,420
Mommy!

673
00:49:25,757 --> 00:49:27,718
Did my baby have fun today?

674
00:49:27,801 --> 00:49:30,053
Can't expect much else from kindergarten.

675
00:49:31,054 --> 00:49:33,223
Stacking blocks and whatnot. So childish!

676
00:49:33,724 --> 00:49:36,810
Hi, Auntie!
Isn't Leo's grandma coming today?

677
00:49:39,104 --> 00:49:42,065
Surprise! I'm here to buy you
a yummy dinner.

678
00:49:42,816 --> 00:49:43,901
Oh, yeah!

679
00:49:44,610 --> 00:49:46,278
Na-na na-na boo-boo.

680
00:49:46,361 --> 00:49:47,779
What are you going to eat?

681
00:49:47,863 --> 00:49:49,031
I want to go too!

682
00:49:50,574 --> 00:49:53,368
You want to?
You want to come with Auntie, Jiu?

683
00:49:53,452 --> 00:49:55,704
Oh, yeah! Na-na na-na boo-boo.

684
00:49:55,787 --> 00:49:57,122
Hey!

685
00:50:12,513 --> 00:50:14,723
Dojin, I saw Haesoo leaving.

686
00:50:15,265 --> 00:50:17,351
<i>Open up. I have something to say.</i>

687
00:50:18,477 --> 00:50:21,480
<i>I'm going to stand here</i>
<i>until you open the door.</i>

688
00:50:26,985 --> 00:50:29,363
Dojin, sweetie. You know--

689
00:50:39,039 --> 00:50:40,040
Chairman.

690
00:50:48,674 --> 00:50:49,842
I'm sorry, Chairman.

691
00:50:50,425 --> 00:50:52,636
I tried to pull myself together,

692
00:50:53,762 --> 00:50:55,347
but it's easier said than done.

693
00:50:57,057 --> 00:50:59,059
I can't live without Dojin.

694
00:51:00,978 --> 00:51:02,604
I don't want anything else.

695
00:51:02,688 --> 00:51:05,649
Would it be all right if I just
stayed quietly by Dojin's side?

696
00:51:06,316 --> 00:51:07,401
Please, Chairman.

697
00:51:09,653 --> 00:51:11,238
Hong Yura!

698
00:51:13,532 --> 00:51:15,158
Father, I'm sorry.

699
00:51:15,242 --> 00:51:16,910
Hey, get out. Get out!

700
00:51:16,994 --> 00:51:18,078
- Let go of this!
- Get--

701
00:51:18,161 --> 00:51:19,162
I said let go!

702
00:51:19,913 --> 00:51:21,957
I have something to say to the Chairman.

703
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,208
All this time, I've--

704
00:51:23,292 --> 00:51:24,251
[gasps]

705
00:51:29,006 --> 00:51:31,466
Are you out of your damn mind?

706
00:51:32,759 --> 00:51:34,469
Is this what I've taught you?

707
00:51:35,345 --> 00:51:37,931
You're fooling around
with Pyo's sister-in-law?

708
00:51:38,515 --> 00:51:40,559
What would your mother say if she knew?

709
00:51:40,642 --> 00:51:44,688
Will she not point fingers and say
that you're a womanizer like your father?

710
00:51:45,772 --> 00:51:47,107
He did nothing wrong.

711
00:51:47,733 --> 00:51:49,067
I initiated the affair.

712
00:51:51,737 --> 00:51:54,406
Ship her off abroad, immediately.

713
00:51:54,489 --> 00:51:57,826
Somewhere far, far away,
so she never comes back.

714
00:51:58,493 --> 00:51:59,494
Understood?

715
00:51:59,578 --> 00:52:01,413
- Chairman.
- Yes, sir. I will.

716
00:52:01,496 --> 00:52:02,623
- Chairman!
- Come here.

717
00:52:02,706 --> 00:52:04,041
- Chairman!
- Let's go!

718
00:52:04,124 --> 00:52:06,460
- What do I have to do for--
- Come here!

719
00:52:08,003 --> 00:52:10,881
No, let go of me! How can you do this?

720
00:52:10,964 --> 00:52:12,090
Let go!

721
00:52:19,139 --> 00:52:21,099
What? "Yes sir, I will"?

722
00:52:22,392 --> 00:52:24,353
You're really going to ship me off?

723
00:52:25,896 --> 00:52:28,106
You think I'm going to disappear
just like that?

724
00:52:29,816 --> 00:52:33,070
I'm going to tell Ko Haesoo everything
about us.

725
00:52:33,946 --> 00:52:35,322
She deserves to know

726
00:52:36,573 --> 00:52:38,951
just how unfaithful her husband has been.

727
00:52:42,037 --> 00:52:44,915
Say a word to Haesoo,
and you'll get more than a warning.

728
00:52:44,998 --> 00:52:47,960
I'm telling you right now.
I will never leave Haesoo.

729
00:52:48,752 --> 00:52:52,089
If you break my family apart,
I just might kill you.

730
00:52:55,843 --> 00:52:56,844
Damn it.

731
00:53:01,181 --> 00:53:02,182
No.

732
00:53:38,969 --> 00:53:41,597
Jaehyun must be so pleased.

733
00:53:42,764 --> 00:53:46,101
You should've been reading books
instead of messing around, you fool.

734
00:53:48,395 --> 00:53:52,441
Make sure you completely get rid of her,
so none of this gets back to you.

735
00:53:54,359 --> 00:53:56,278
You understand what I'm saying?

736
00:53:56,361 --> 00:53:57,529
Yes, I understand.

737
00:54:03,994 --> 00:54:05,037

How come you're alone? Where's Jiu?

Ms. Ko picked her up.

Haesoo did? What are you saying?

747

She said they'd be having dinner together
and that she's checked with you, ma'am.

How disappointing.

I've always trusted you,
but I guess you haven't.

To reunite with your sister

I don't have a sister.

and work things out with that bastard.

00:59:37,286 --> 00:59:38,412
Sungchan, what's wrong?

801
00:59:39,413 --> 00:59:40,289
Look at me.

- Hey, hey!

You don't like me?

Let go! Let go of me!

809
00:59:58,015 --> 01:00:00,350
It's mine! Give it back! Give it to me!

Please pick up, Hong Taera!

Yura.

- [Sungchan] <i>Why did you do it? Why?</i>
- [gasps]

829
01:05:34,643 --> 01:05:36,436
All of this is Jang Dojin's fault.

830
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:38,230
My sister-in-law was your mistress?

831
01:05:38,313 --> 01:05:39,481
It's driving me crazy too!

832
