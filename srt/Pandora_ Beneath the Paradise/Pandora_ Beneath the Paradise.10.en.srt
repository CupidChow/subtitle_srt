00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:54,971
PANDORA: BENEATH THE PARADISE

2
00:00:55,784 --> 00:00:58,677
12 YEARS AGO

3
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,322
You dropped your book.

4
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,075
Thank you. You're very kind.

5
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:17,243
Isn't this
Park Ki Woong's art book?

6
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:19,662
Oh, yes. I love his work.

7
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:23,667
So do I.

8
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:32,384
I really wanted to go
to his Seoul exhibition last year.

9
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:35,345
But I didn't get to go. How was it?

10
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:39,015
Oh, I bet it was great.

11
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,767
I haven't seen his work in person yet.

12
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,310
I hope you go next time.

13
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:44,938
I think he's holding one next year.

14
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:46,690
I'm definitely going.

15
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,525
I'm going, no matter what.

16
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,612
- How about another glass of wine?
- Sure.

17
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,490
May we have some more wine?

18
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:57,283
Of course, sir.

19
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,623
PASSENGER TERMINAL 2

20
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:07,043
I don't think we've exchanged
names yet. We got on well, didn't we?

21
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,503
We did.

22
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:11,131
No time like the present. I'm Jang Kyojin.

23
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:12,590
- Taera.
- I'm--

24
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,718
Jaehyun.

25
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:17,512
Pyo Jaehyun?

26
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:18,972
Oh, Kyojin.

27
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:22,058
You back from a business trip?
What are the chances?

28
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,268
I know, right?

29
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:24,894
You two know each other?

30
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,230
This is Dojin's brother.

31
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,027
Well, what are the chances?

32
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:35,196
So are you two…

33
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,991
- We--
- This is my girlfriend, Kyojin.

34
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,453
- Jaehyun?
- That's me finally asking you out.

35
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:44,873
Actually, I wanted to make it official
today. You will accept, yes?

36
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:00,305
EPISODE 10

37
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:44,182
HACKING SYSTEM

38
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,030
Was this press conference necessary?

39
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:02,200
Didn't we already know
Dojin left Hatch to take over Kumjo?

40
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:04,953
Ko Haesoo actually called
for this press conference.

41
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:06,746
I wonder what she wanted to say.

42
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:11,584
By the looks of it, it's as if
Jang prevented his wife from speaking.

43
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,670
I think there's something else
at play.

44
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,839
Exactly. I don't get it.

45
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,549
- Let's just go.
- Let's.

46
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:21,177
<i>The phone is switched off.</i>
<i>Please leave a message after the tone.</i>

47
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:36,359
Mr. Uhm?

48
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:05,138
Hey, what the hell? You bastard.

49
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:17,442
Haesoo.

50
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:18,943
Haesoo, wake up.

51
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:20,737
Haesoo.

52
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:24,532
Taera?

53
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,789
Haesoo. Ko Haesoo!

54
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:33,333
Haesoo, wake up! Ko Haesoo!

55
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,127
Ko Haesoo! Haesoo.

56
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,421
You little--

57
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,640
MISSION COMPLETE

58
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:54,396
She'll be sent
to the Philippines.

59
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,315
There, she'll be shipped off
to a godforsaken island.

60
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:00,151
Nobody will ever find her.

61
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,530
Dojin won't cause trouble either.

62
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:10,328
We know how much he loves Haesoo.

63
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:12,122
He'd be too ashamed to face her.

64
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:16,167
His marriage ended
the moment he chose his father over her.

65
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,586
Just make up a story.

66
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:21,464
He knows she'd never reach out first
anyway.

67
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,508
He won't dig too deep.

68
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:30,265
Now that Kim Seondeok's dead
and Ko Haesoo's been taken care of,

69
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:33,435
That bastard Mr. Jo
is our one last loose end.

70
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:38,314
Do you trust Hong Taera?

71
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:43,236
Apparently, she tried to kill you.

72
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,821
She'll never abandon me.

73
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:51,286
We have a shared past,
not to mention our daughter Jiu.

74
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,497
She may be confused for now,

75
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,043
but she'll come around in time.

76
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,555
Don't breathe a word of this.

77
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:13,600
Don't worry, sir. I saw nothing today.

78
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,859
Take care of Haesoo.

79
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,820
- You're not coming with us?
- I have to stop by somewhere.

80
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,490
Oh, man.

81
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,452
Oh, geez.

82
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:35,288
What?

83
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:38,333
Director, you haven't sent
the presentation report yet.

84
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,543
Tomorrow's the submission deadline.

85
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:42,545
Oh, right. Damn it.

86
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:49,969
Wait.

87
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:53,014
Did I leave it at the special lab?

88
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:54,099
You sure it's there?

89
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:56,685
It's confidential. It can't be leaked.

90
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:58,895
Shall I go now and check?

91
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,563
Hey, hey. One sec.

92
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:03,525
Geez. For goodness' sake.

93
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,155
I'm sure I brought it here.

94
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,852
What the hell?

95
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:44,733
Block all exits. Dispatch every
security employee we have. Everyone!

96
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:45,817
Stop them!

97
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:50,989
Oh, what's going on?

98
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,949
Sungchan knows.

99
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:56,202
Wait, I have to shut down
the security system.

100
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,631
SECURITY SYSTEM DISARMED

101
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,511
To the lab! Hurry!

102
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,572
Emergency exit is locked.
Is there another way out?

103
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:37,369
We lost access to the system,
but we're bypassing the firewall now.

104
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,162
What about Ms. Hong?

105
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,373
I sent her a text. She hasn't replied yet.

106
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:42,999
Kyojin.

107
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:49,214
Can you open the freight elevator?

108
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:50,674
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

109
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:59,140
He wakes up after seven years
and hacks Hatch security?

110
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:01,059
How is that possible?

111
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:03,436
Shit.

112
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,938
Hold on a little longer.

113
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,360
Let's go.

114
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:16,074
Don't move!

115
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,868
Basement level 3. Target's esca--

116
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:23,748
- Sorry I'm late. Let's get out of here.
- Taera.

117
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:25,834
By the freight elevator!

118
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:39,848
Will you be okay?

119
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,392
Hang in there.

120
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:52,902
I apologize for calling last minute.
I owe you one again.

121
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,946
Why are you moving him in such a hurry?

122
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:58,783
Sungchan might've had something to do
with Kyojin's accident.

123
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:00,493
Sungchan?

124
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:02,412
Thank you so much, Taera.

125
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,872
I'll be in touch soon.

126
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,624
We'll be seeing you.

127
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:30,857
Shit. Damn it.

128
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,484
Go home.

129
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:34,527
And don't you dare come back!

130
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:37,322
If you do, I'll kill you all myself.
Get out!

131
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,408
Get out of my face! I said out!

132
00:11:40,492 --> 00:11:41,785
Everybody, out!

133
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,912
Geez. Damn it.

134
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:46,790
Damn, it's hot. Shit.

135
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:52,462
Looks like Kyojin breached
my security program.

136
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:53,963
How's that pos--

137
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:14,859
RETURN HATCH TO ME.
WHERE IS SUJEONG?

138
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:18,196
If he escaped like this,
it means he was conscious all along,

139
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:21,866
which means he was watching us
the entire time.

140
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,086
Kyojin, you okay?

141
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:34,212
I'm fine now.

142
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:37,799
- When is Dr. Hwang arriving?
- He'll be here soon.

143
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:41,970
I've sent the chairman's men home,
so you can rest at ease.

144
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,975
What does that mean?
Something happen between you two?

145
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,228
Kummo had a stroke.

146
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:52,564
He hasn't woken up since his operation.

147
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:54,190
Is he in a critical state?

148
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:58,153
It's a fitting retribution for the pain
he inflicted on others his whole life.

149
00:12:58,236 --> 00:13:01,322
You don't need to treat him
like a father anymore.

150
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,338
<i>How could you…</i>

151
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,299
How could you do this to me?

152
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,226
13 YEARS AGO

153
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,106
No, Haesoo! Haesoo!

154
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,277
What's gotten into you?

155
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:42,364
I can't remember Mom and Dad's faces.

156
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:45,367
I want to die.

157
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,119
I just want to die.

158
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:51,539
Don't-- No, Haesoo.

159
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:53,458
I-- I'll help you get better.

160
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,002
Let's keep living, Haesoo, together.

161
00:13:56,503 --> 00:14:01,383
I'll protect you, no matter what.
Whatever happens, I will protect you.

162
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:06,721
Really? You'll always be by my side?

163
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:09,474
Yes.

164
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,071
Dojin.

165
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:26,157
Dojin.

166
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:45,969
What happened?

167
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:47,679
Why are you here?

168
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,432
I saw Mr. Uhm kidnap you,
so I followed him.

169
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,521
You feeling okay? You hurt anywhere?

170
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:04,487
Don't worry. No one knows you're here.

171
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:06,531
I didn't even contact Dojin.

172
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:10,160
- Dojin tried to have me killed.
- No.

173
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:12,662
The man who tried to kill you

174
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:13,747
is Jaehyun.

175
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:16,708
Mr. Uhm dragged me out
while Dojin just stood there.

176
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:19,336
I saw that bastard betray me
with my own eyes.

177
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,129
Jaehyun blackmailed him

178
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:25,842
because he knows Chairman Jang
put out the hit on your father.

179
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:28,219
You…

180
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:31,765
You knew all along?

181
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:33,975
The sniper who shot your father…

182
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:38,772
No. 50, the killer you've been seeking
for so long…

183
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:44,027
is me, Haesoo.

184
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:52,827
I'm sorry.

185
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,280
So this is where you brought my brother
to test the smart patch, huh?

186
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:30,990
You two tricked me?

187
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:33,618
Your stepmother gave her approval.

188
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:35,578
That's beside the point, damn it.

189
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:38,540
What were you going to do
if something happened to him?

190
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:41,501
Your brother walked out of here
with his own two feet.

191
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:44,295
You're welcome for that. Geez.

192
00:16:46,131 --> 00:16:47,590
That's irrelevant now.

193
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:52,012
Kyojin regained his consciousness
and physical strength long ago.

194
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:55,473
But he kept that to himself.
Why do you think he did that?

195
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:58,351
Because he doesn't trust us.

196
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:03,606
Because he doubts us.

197
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:06,109
RETURN HATCH TO ME.
WHERE IS SUJEONG?

198
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:12,115
No, Sujeong's accident that day
is a secret only among us.

199
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,950
Nobody knows but us.

200
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:16,661
You know what Kyojin's like.

201
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:18,121
If he's suspicious of us,

202
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:22,167
it's his way of saying he'll find out
the truth about that day soon enough,

203
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,836
and that he's taking Hatch back.

204
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:27,756
He'd been listening in
on all of our conversations.

205
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,008
Even the ones about Sujeong.

206
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,347
<i>Why do you all look so nervous?</i>

207
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:39,309
Sujeong.

208
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:40,393
7 YEARS AGO

209
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:42,479
Hey, looks like you're the one
who's nervous.

210
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,858
It's my first time
participating as a test subject,

211
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:48,276
so I'm pretty nervous.

212
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:52,989
Thanks for making such a big decision.
By the way, you're looking pretty today.

213
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:58,620
Hey, so did Kyojin
really give you the green light?

214
00:17:59,371 --> 00:18:02,874
I think he mentioned how human trials
needed a few modifications.

215
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:05,460
Of course he did.

216
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:08,505
You know just as well
how much of a perfectionist he is.

217
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:13,009
Hey, we had a few successful simulations.
There's no need to worry.

218
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:14,094
More importantly,

219
00:18:14,177 --> 00:18:17,430
let's get you out of that wheelchair
so you can assist Kyojin again.

220
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:19,933
Hatch is launching soon, you know.

221
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:24,020
If this experiment succeeds,
you better buy us a nice big meal.

222
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:25,397
You got this.

223
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:28,149
- Go, go, go!
- Let's do this!

224
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:29,234
Go, go, go!

225
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,363
Okay, let's begin.

226
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:53,925
Injection complete.

227
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:56,386
How do you feel, huh?

228
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:59,639
- You okay?
- Yeah, it's bearable.

229
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:02,475
Okay.

230
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,814
Neural connection complete.

231
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:12,152
Now we're going to send neural signals
to stimulate your motor nerves.

232
00:19:12,235 --> 00:19:15,447
Your brain will transduce
the signals, send it to the spine,

233
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,574
and move your paralyzed legs.

234
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:21,119
It may hurt depending on the
stimulation level. Just let us know.

235
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:23,580
We'll start from level ten.

236
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:25,331
Here we go.

237
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:33,340
Feel anything?
Can you try moving your legs?

238
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:41,890
I can't move them.

239
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,391
Really?

240
00:19:44,476 --> 00:19:47,395
Sungchan, can you raise
the stimulation level just a bit?

241
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:49,814
- Okay. I'll raise it to 20.
- Okay.

242
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:56,488
How about now?

243
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:04,245
Wow! Wow.

244
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:06,331
Sh-- She just moved, right?

245
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:08,166
- Wow.
- Sujeong.

246
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:11,461
We'll gradually amp up stimulation.
You'll be walking in no time.

247
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:14,631
But it hurts a little.
Do you think I'll be okay?

248
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:16,966
Hey, toughen up!
This means you can walk again.

249
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:21,304
He's right!
Hey, I'll just amp it up to 40, yeah?

250
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:22,722
- Okay.
- Okay, okay.

251
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:29,479
She moved!

252
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:30,814
She's moving!

253
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:34,484
- Hey, hey! Get the walker!
- Hey, Dojin! Quick!

254
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,111
- Here.
- Wait, wait.

255
00:20:36,194 --> 00:20:38,905
Sujeong, can you try standing with this?

256
00:20:39,614 --> 00:20:40,865
- Okay.
- We'll help you.

257
00:20:40,949 --> 00:20:42,742
- Yes, lean on us.
- Let's try.

258
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:44,786
- Okay. One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

259
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:48,248
- Put your hand here.
- Your hand. Hand.

260
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:49,791
- You got it.
- Good, good.

261
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:53,878
- Here we go.
- Sujeong, give it all you got, huh?

262
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:57,173
Hey, I'll take the stimulation up to 60.

263
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:07,308
- That's it.
- Hey, something doesn't feel right!

264
00:21:07,392 --> 00:21:10,270
- Well…
- I can't hold it much longer! Let's stop!

265
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:14,107
It's probably just an immune response,
like a temporary paralysis.

266
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,943
- That's right.
- Let's take it all the way up.

267
00:21:17,027 --> 00:21:19,112
- Let's see how much she moves then.
- Okay.

268
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:21,740
- Raising it to 80. Sujeong, here we go.
- Okay.

269
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:26,119
- Oh, it's working!
- Go, go, go!

270
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:27,787
Keep it up!

271
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:30,040
Yes! She's moving!

272
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,377
I-- I can't hold it anymore!
Please turn it off!

273
00:21:34,461 --> 00:21:35,503
I can't hold it!

274
00:21:35,587 --> 00:21:38,006
Hey, stop being selfish--

275
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:41,593
Sujeong.

276
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:43,762
Su--

277
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:49,768
Wait, I-- I don't think she's breathing.

278
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:52,729
Wh-- What the hell do you mean?

279
00:21:55,857 --> 00:21:58,026
What the hell? Is she really dead?

280
00:22:01,363 --> 00:22:03,031
Hey! We're in trouble.

281
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:06,201
- Kyojin's coming here now.
- What? Why, all of a sudden?

282
00:22:06,284 --> 00:22:08,495
- How should I know?
- Hey, hey! Calm down.

283
00:22:08,578 --> 00:22:10,914
- Clean this up first.
- Hey, clean up, quick!

284
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:12,374
- Oh, man.
- Shit.

285
00:22:18,463 --> 00:22:21,716
What the hell was he thinking?
Why did he raise it all the way to--

286
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,968
Hey, hey. Hey, douchebag.

287
00:22:24,052 --> 00:22:27,180
What did you just say, huh?
You saying this is my fault?

288
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:31,518
Hey, you're the one
who raised the stimulation all the way up.

289
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:33,186
I raised it up? I did?

290
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:35,605
Wow, you're driving me up the wall.

291
00:22:35,689 --> 00:22:39,693
Jaehyun, that joker, kept egging me on
to raise it to the max, right?

292
00:22:39,776 --> 00:22:42,696
Ignoring her pain because it's
an immune response is his fault?

293
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:47,575
Hey, you think you're being funny?

294
00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:50,245
Shall we check the recording
and see who's at fault?

295
00:22:50,328 --> 00:22:52,372
So what is it you want to say?

296
00:22:52,455 --> 00:22:56,918
We started this behind Kyojin's back,
but nobody expected this to happen, right?

297
00:22:57,877 --> 00:23:01,840
We need to get rid of the body quickly.
Wasting time won't help us.

298
00:23:03,341 --> 00:23:06,469
We deleted the surveillance footage,
and we agreed on a story.

299
00:23:06,553 --> 00:23:08,638
Nobody will suspect us now, okay?

300
00:23:08,722 --> 00:23:10,682
Don't you know what Kyojin is like?

301
00:23:10,765 --> 00:23:14,769
- We'll never be able to hide this.
- What the hell are you suggesting?

302
00:23:14,853 --> 00:23:17,313
Get in. Let's tell the cops.
Let's go to the police and--

303
00:23:17,397 --> 00:23:19,065
Hey, let go of me, punk!

304
00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:22,068
Once Father finds out,
it'll be the end of me, for real.

305
00:23:22,152 --> 00:23:26,614
Wow, I'm so sick of your shit.
You selfish bastard.

306
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:30,535
- You think this only affects you?
- Hey, hey. Be quiet.

307
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:33,538
INCOMING CALL
KYOJIN

308
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:34,914
What do we do?

309
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:38,752
Pick up-- No, don't pick up.

310
00:23:38,835 --> 00:23:40,670
I think I'm going to lose my mind.

311
00:23:40,754 --> 00:23:41,755
If he finds out,

312
00:23:41,838 --> 00:23:45,008
he'll kick us out of the team--
No, he'll call the police on us.

313
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:47,177
Hey, what if we all go to jail for murder?

314
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:49,846
- Just shut up, you jackass.
- I'm picking up.

315
00:23:53,475 --> 00:23:55,477
- Yes, Kyojin.
- <i>Hey, Jaehyun.</i>

316
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:58,355
<i>You with the others?</i>
<i>I can't seem to reach them.</i>

317
00:23:58,438 --> 00:24:01,024
Oh, we had drinks at my house.
They're asleep now.

318
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:03,651
<i>Drinking the night before off-roading?</i>

319
00:24:04,527 --> 00:24:06,071
Did you happen to see Sujeong?

320
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,448
Sujeong?

321
00:24:09,199 --> 00:24:12,369
No, I haven't. Are you at the lab now?

322
00:24:14,829 --> 00:24:17,374
Yeah, I can't reach her.
She's not at the lab either.

323
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:21,670
You should just head on home.
I'll make sure they show up tomorrow.

324
00:24:22,712 --> 00:24:25,131
Of course, they're looking forward to it.

325
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:27,175
Yes, see you tomorrow.

326
00:24:28,802 --> 00:24:32,597
Hey-- Hey, have you gone insane?
We're going for real?

327
00:24:33,181 --> 00:24:35,684
What about th-- Sujeong?

328
00:24:35,767 --> 00:24:36,768
Say we don't go.

329
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:41,022
What sudden excuse can the three of us
come up with?

330
00:24:41,106 --> 00:24:44,734
It'll only look more suspicious.
We have to take care of this anyway.

331
00:24:46,528 --> 00:24:50,532
The thing is,
it doesn't have to be all three of us.

332
00:24:53,702 --> 00:24:56,246
Whoever comes in last tomorrow
takes full responsibility.

333
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,081
What do you say?

334
00:25:01,501 --> 00:25:04,045
<i>Hold on,</i>
<i>the brakes aren't working--</i>

335
00:25:12,387 --> 00:25:14,139
All on board with today's bet?

336
00:25:14,222 --> 00:25:16,766
In return,
take this secret to the grave.

337
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:19,519
Whoever comes in last
takes full responsibility.

338
00:25:50,342 --> 00:25:51,343
You?

339
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:53,636
You came in first?

340
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:56,765
Y-- You didn't check up on your brother?

341
00:25:56,848 --> 00:26:00,727
Geez, I'm going now.
I'm sure he'll be fine.

342
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:04,022
Hey, listen. Be sure
you tell Jaehyun I came in first, okay?

343
00:26:11,988 --> 00:26:14,115
Boy, was he hell-bent on winning.

344
00:26:17,535 --> 00:26:18,536
Wait a minute.

345
00:26:19,621 --> 00:26:21,414
How is Jaehyun last place?

346
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:26,795
That day,
Jaehyun never made it to the peak

347
00:26:26,878 --> 00:26:28,880
because he was looking for Kyojin.

348
00:26:29,714 --> 00:26:31,758
Jaehyun reported it too, no?

349
00:26:31,841 --> 00:26:34,803
While this schmuck of a brother
gave it all to be first.

350
00:26:34,886 --> 00:26:37,430
None of us knew
how serious his accident was.

351
00:26:37,514 --> 00:26:42,227
Also, didn't you reach the peak too?
What right do you have to criticize me?

352
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,937
Well, he wasn't my brother.

353
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:46,981
Honestly, didn't you think
the accident was really strange?

354
00:26:47,065 --> 00:26:49,317
You still think I did it?

355
00:26:50,694 --> 00:26:54,406
Well, aren't you the one
who benefited the most from it?

356
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,908
You became the chairman of Kumjo.

357
00:26:56,991 --> 00:26:59,077
One more word, and I'll kill you myself.

358
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,620
Hey, hey, hey!

359
00:27:03,373 --> 00:27:05,834
Get it together.
There's no time to bicker.

360
00:27:05,917 --> 00:27:09,838
The future of Hatch hangs on
the human smart patch presentation.

361
00:27:11,548 --> 00:27:15,927
We have to stop Kyojin,
no matter what. Got it?

362
00:27:16,011 --> 00:27:20,932
I've worked too hard to build Hatch.
I'd never let Kyojin take it away.

363
00:27:21,725 --> 00:27:25,562
Besides, whoever came in last that day
was to take responsibility for Sujeong.

364
00:27:26,271 --> 00:27:28,648
Jaehyun, what did you do with her?

365
00:27:31,735 --> 00:27:32,944
Now you want to know?

366
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:36,031
Don't worry. I took care of her.

367
00:27:36,656 --> 00:27:38,575
Kyojin will never find her.

368
00:27:39,117 --> 00:27:41,661
His suspicions will only end up
being speculations.

369
00:27:42,245 --> 00:27:45,582
So all you have to do
is to get the presentation ready.

370
00:27:46,666 --> 00:27:50,378
And you, whatever the cost,
will stop Kyojin from appearing in public.

371
00:27:52,255 --> 00:27:54,966
You'll need to protect Kumjo Group, no?

372
00:28:06,353 --> 00:28:07,354
Jang Dojin.

373
00:28:15,028 --> 00:28:17,113
Guess you're not so concerned
about Haesoo?

374
00:28:17,864 --> 00:28:20,075
I was ready to tell you if you asked.

375
00:28:20,158 --> 00:28:21,618
You don't even seem curious.

376
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,412
I heard from Mr. Uhm.

377
00:28:26,915 --> 00:28:32,295
Keep your promise that you'll send her
abroad without harming a hair on her head.

378
00:28:34,172 --> 00:28:36,257
Hey, I care about Haesoo too.

379
00:28:36,758 --> 00:28:38,093
Don't you worry.

380
00:28:39,844 --> 00:28:42,931
Just keep a close eye on Kyojin,
and keep me updated.

381
00:28:51,398 --> 00:28:53,858
Pyo Jaehyun made you into Hong Taera?

382
00:28:56,695 --> 00:28:58,697
He knew everything all along,

383
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:02,450
that I was the killer
and that Jang Kummo was the mastermind.

384
00:29:03,576 --> 00:29:08,665
He knew, and yet he brought you to me
and watched you get married to Dojin.

385
00:29:09,582 --> 00:29:12,711
It's all a part of Pyo Jaehyun's
revenge plot against Jang Kummo.

386
00:29:14,212 --> 00:29:15,797
We were all his pawns.

387
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,592
You expect me to believe this bullshit?

388
00:29:20,218 --> 00:29:21,803
After I recovered my memory,

389
00:29:23,304 --> 00:29:25,724
I had to find out who made me Hong Taera.

390
00:29:26,641 --> 00:29:28,893
I recently figured out it was my husband.

391
00:29:33,273 --> 00:29:34,482
I'm sorry, Haesoo.

392
00:29:38,361 --> 00:29:40,822
I knew that you were coping
with so much pain.

393
00:29:43,074 --> 00:29:44,909
Sorry to tell you this now.

394
00:29:50,832 --> 00:29:52,292
Stop making excuses.

395
00:29:52,375 --> 00:29:54,961
You think I'll ever forgive you
for killing my father?

396
00:29:55,795 --> 00:29:57,297
You're a murderer.

397
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,341
My mother also died because of you.

398
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:01,801
You turned my life into a living hell!

399
00:30:05,347 --> 00:30:06,348
Why'd you do it?

400
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:09,351
Why did you kill my dad?

401
00:30:10,894 --> 00:30:12,479
Why did you come into my life?

402
00:30:13,438 --> 00:30:15,106
Why were you so kind to me?

403
00:30:15,982 --> 00:30:18,151
Why did you let me trust you?

404
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:20,779
Why did you make me like you? Why?

405
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:30,789
If you tell me to leave, I will.

406
00:30:32,207 --> 00:30:33,833
If you tell me to die, I'll die.

407
00:30:39,381 --> 00:30:41,383
I'll do whatever you tell me to do.

408
00:30:46,971 --> 00:30:48,348
I'm so sorry, Haesoo.

409
00:30:50,517 --> 00:30:51,851
You're not going anywhere.

410
00:30:53,645 --> 00:30:56,147
What makes you think
I'll forgive you so easily?

411
00:30:57,482 --> 00:31:01,236
I spent the last 15 years in hell,
and you're just going to die?

412
00:31:01,736 --> 00:31:02,987
Not a chance.

413
00:31:03,988 --> 00:31:05,657
You will suffer like I did.

414
00:31:06,574 --> 00:31:08,868
All my pain and sadness…

415
00:31:10,245 --> 00:31:13,289
You will learn how it feels
when you can't end your own life.

416
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:20,338
You will go back to Jaehyun.

417
00:31:21,756 --> 00:31:25,427
You will continue to live as Taera
and experience hell on earth.

418
00:31:28,888 --> 00:31:31,725
You will wait for me
until I decide your punishment.

419
00:31:35,645 --> 00:31:37,063
I pray for your misery.

420
00:31:38,356 --> 00:31:41,818
I want each passing minute
to be painful and agonizing.

421
00:31:43,528 --> 00:31:47,741
You will not laugh, cry, or even die
without my explicit permission.

422
00:31:49,617 --> 00:31:50,702
And if you run…

423
00:31:53,371 --> 00:31:55,373
you'll only wish you were dead.

424
00:32:25,403 --> 00:32:27,572
Is Ko Haesoo awake?

425
00:32:28,448 --> 00:32:29,449
Yeah.

426
00:32:30,116 --> 00:32:31,743
Thanks for the help earlier.

427
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:38,041
These are files on Kim Seondeok
from the Hanwool annex data.

428
00:32:38,792 --> 00:32:42,879
As we expected, there are records
of Pyo Jaehyun and Director Kim's deal.

429
00:32:44,547 --> 00:32:45,757
Continue as planned.

430
00:32:46,883 --> 00:32:47,884
And be careful.

431
00:32:47,967 --> 00:32:50,178
So what happens next?

432
00:32:54,641 --> 00:32:57,769
I have to take the fall
to tear down Jaehyun.

433
00:33:02,941 --> 00:33:05,193
I won't be a coward
to protect myself anymore.

434
00:33:33,263 --> 00:33:36,391
If you're cooperating
with the man you once tried to kill,

435
00:33:37,517 --> 00:33:41,104
you must be getting something
extraordinary from Jaehyun.

436
00:33:42,147 --> 00:33:43,523
Perhaps,

437
00:33:43,606 --> 00:33:45,442
the CEO position at Hatch?

438
00:33:46,443 --> 00:33:51,823
Well, we had our misunderstandings,
but Jaehyun is one of my oldest friends.

439
00:33:51,906 --> 00:33:52,907
My best friend.

440
00:33:54,117 --> 00:33:55,118
See you around.

441
00:33:55,994 --> 00:33:56,995
Jaehyun

442
00:33:58,163 --> 00:34:00,707
will never hand over Hatch so easily.

443
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:03,960
You of all people should know

444
00:34:04,586 --> 00:34:07,297
that he doesn't really trust anyone.

445
00:34:10,008 --> 00:34:11,217
Guess we'll see

446
00:34:12,427 --> 00:34:14,471
if you get to take over Hatch.

447
00:34:20,894 --> 00:34:22,604
Does she take me for a fool?

448
00:34:22,687 --> 00:34:24,189
Damn it.

449
00:34:29,944 --> 00:34:31,237
Where were you?

450
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:35,825
Well, I'm sure you need
some time to think.

451
00:34:37,035 --> 00:34:38,787
Take all the time you need.

452
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:41,331
I'll always be here, waiting for you.

453
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:45,460
<i>You will go back to Jaehyun.</i>

454
00:34:46,544 --> 00:34:50,340
<i>You will continue to live as Taera</i>
<i>and experience hell on earth.</i>

455
00:34:53,718 --> 00:34:56,596
I made Jiu breakfast
and sent her off to kindergarten.

456
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,515
The presidential debate is coming up.

457
00:34:59,808 --> 00:35:01,393
You're rooting for me, right?

458
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,401
<i>Oh, I am.</i>

459
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:11,820
<i>For your downfall.</i>

460
00:35:14,531 --> 00:35:17,367
- I bet she got a massive alimony.
- You didn't see the news?

461
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:20,704
They brought up her mental health,
which means they won't pay up.

462
00:35:20,787 --> 00:35:22,205
And the husband got custody.

463
00:35:22,288 --> 00:35:26,543
Listen, Kumjo's been keeping quiet.
Something's definitely fishy.

464
00:35:27,043 --> 00:35:29,713
Maybe Ko was kicked out without a penny.

465
00:35:30,588 --> 00:35:32,257
Oh, look, it's Ko's bestie!

466
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:35,260
Hey, man. So…

467
00:35:35,885 --> 00:35:38,388
- You hear anything?
- What happened?

468
00:35:38,471 --> 00:35:40,890
Is it true that she had an affair?

469
00:35:40,974 --> 00:35:42,684
Is she getting alimony? How much?

470
00:35:43,518 --> 00:35:45,895
Damn, you piece of scum.

471
00:35:45,979 --> 00:35:48,314
What? What did you just call me?

472
00:35:48,398 --> 00:35:49,691
I'm talking about me.

473
00:35:49,774 --> 00:35:53,319
I'm baffled as to how a bastard
like myself can pretend to be human.

474
00:35:56,906 --> 00:35:59,492
I'm telling you,
Ms. Ko isn't home right now.

475
00:35:59,576 --> 00:36:00,952
Where is she?

476
00:36:01,036 --> 00:36:02,996
She's not home. Please leave.

477
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:05,373
<i>Leo.</i>

478
00:36:05,457 --> 00:36:08,668
- Grandma!
- Oh, my precious baby.

479
00:36:08,752 --> 00:36:09,878
How have you been?

480
00:36:10,545 --> 00:36:12,964
I missed you so much, Grandma.

481
00:36:13,882 --> 00:36:15,175
What took you so long?

482
00:36:15,258 --> 00:36:16,801
Oh, gosh. I'm sorry.

483
00:36:16,885 --> 00:36:20,263
That's why Grandma packed
a bunch of your favorite food.

484
00:36:20,347 --> 00:36:21,765
I love you, Grandma!

485
00:36:23,266 --> 00:36:24,267
But…

486
00:36:25,018 --> 00:36:26,019
that's weird.

487
00:36:26,644 --> 00:36:29,606
Mommy said you weren't coming
to see me anymore.

488
00:36:30,732 --> 00:36:33,860
I was really sad because I thought
I might never see you again.

489
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:38,865
Leo, want to come live with Grandma?
At my house?

490
00:36:39,657 --> 00:36:42,327
No, then Daddy will be here all alone.

491
00:36:43,036 --> 00:36:44,996
I'm so mad he became the chairman.

492
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,374
He's going to be even busier now.

493
00:36:49,084 --> 00:36:51,711
Can Grandpa just be chairman again?

494
00:36:52,962 --> 00:36:54,589
Grandma,

495
00:36:55,215 --> 00:36:58,843
tell Grandpa to hurry and wake up
so he can be the chairman again.

496
00:37:16,277 --> 00:37:18,613
Kyojin would like to see you, Taera.

497
00:37:18,697 --> 00:37:21,491
People are watching,
so we should go in my car.

498
00:37:22,033 --> 00:37:23,034
Yes, ma'am.

499
00:37:30,041 --> 00:37:31,292
What's this? Whoa, whoa.

500
00:37:35,463 --> 00:37:37,382
I'm here to help you, Mr. Han.

501
00:37:37,465 --> 00:37:40,093
Don't worry. I'm not one of Pyo's men.

502
00:37:40,176 --> 00:37:42,429
You think I'll trust a murder suspect?

503
00:37:42,512 --> 00:37:43,888
I've seen the evidence.

504
00:37:44,764 --> 00:37:46,516
You'll trust me when you see this.

505
00:37:56,317 --> 00:37:57,694
CONFIDENTIAL, SECRET

506
00:37:57,777 --> 00:37:59,362
HUMAN TRIALS
PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT

507
00:37:59,446 --> 00:38:03,700
Pyo procured subjects for human trials
from the late Director Kim.

508
00:38:04,409 --> 00:38:08,371
His claim that he has no connections
to Director Kim is entirely false.

509
00:38:08,455 --> 00:38:10,874
So what is it you want from me?

510
00:38:10,957 --> 00:38:12,792
Why are you giving this to me?

511
00:38:13,626 --> 00:38:15,628
I came to ask you to stop Pyo

512
00:38:16,629 --> 00:38:18,214
from becoming president.

513
00:38:20,592 --> 00:38:24,471
Well, then I shall grant your wish.

514
00:38:24,554 --> 00:38:29,893
I, Han Kyungrok,
will make your wishes come true.

515
00:38:32,187 --> 00:38:33,605
Before we proceed,

516
00:38:34,606 --> 00:38:38,485
you'll stop the homicide investigations
against me, won't you?

517
00:38:38,568 --> 00:38:42,739
Who would dare to sully the name
of my precious supporter?

518
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:49,579
Don't you worry. I will prove to you
the clout of the next president.

519
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:01,216
<i>I delivered the files</i>
<i>to Mr. Han.</i>

520
00:39:02,926 --> 00:39:05,136
It's that way. You can see him now.

521
00:39:12,602 --> 00:39:14,771
Thank you for taking the time
to come see me.

522
00:39:15,897 --> 00:39:17,482
You look well, Kyojin.

523
00:39:18,274 --> 00:39:20,235
It's hard to believe you were in a coma.

524
00:39:20,318 --> 00:39:22,028
All thanks to the system at Hatch.

525
00:39:28,326 --> 00:39:32,997
Was Jaehyun waiting for you to wake up
because of Hatch?

526
00:39:33,081 --> 00:39:34,791
I'm the founder of Hatch.

527
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:39,087
All the work done at Hatch is based
on my theories from seven years ago.

528
00:39:40,755 --> 00:39:44,551
I think one of the guys has
the flash drive with my research files.

529
00:39:52,976 --> 00:39:56,938
Is it the one with "Hatch" written on it?

530
00:39:57,022 --> 00:39:59,441
Yes. How do you know about that, Taera?

531
00:40:00,525 --> 00:40:02,068
Sungchan has it.

532
00:40:03,361 --> 00:40:06,865
Jaehyun was trying to steal it,
so I returned it to him.

533
00:40:07,365 --> 00:40:08,783
I thought it was Sungchan's.

534
00:40:09,492 --> 00:40:11,578
Well, I guess Sungchan
was the one who stole it.

535
00:40:12,454 --> 00:40:14,956
He's always had an inferiority complex.

536
00:40:16,249 --> 00:40:20,545
He kept the files to himself and used them
to become the research director.

537
00:40:20,628 --> 00:40:22,714
Do you think he caused the accident

538
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,925
to get his hands on your files?

539
00:40:26,009 --> 00:40:28,345
I'm still not sure who the culprit is.

540
00:40:28,428 --> 00:40:31,097
It could be because of Hatch or Sujeong.

541
00:40:31,931 --> 00:40:37,979
All I know is that one of those three
messed with my bike and tried to kill me.

542
00:40:39,647 --> 00:40:42,317
We have to find Sujeong
to get to the bottom of this.

543
00:40:42,942 --> 00:40:44,736
I know they did something to her.

544
00:40:44,819 --> 00:40:48,114
I'll get you your flash drive

545
00:40:49,532 --> 00:40:52,577
before Jaehyun figures out
that Sungchan has it.

546
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:54,120
It's too risky.

547
00:40:55,246 --> 00:40:57,916
I'm going to put everything back
to its rightful place.

548
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:59,959
It's what I need to do.

549
00:41:04,214 --> 00:41:05,965
Sorry for the delay.

550
00:41:07,258 --> 00:41:08,593
Come eat with us, Ms. Min.

551
00:41:08,677 --> 00:41:10,929
That's all right. This is between you two.

552
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,516
I think you need to hear this too, ma'am.

553
00:41:17,185 --> 00:41:19,187
Is it about Jaehyun?

554
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:22,649
You and Jaehyun aren't
the people I used to know.

555
00:41:24,109 --> 00:41:26,903
Chairman Jang Kummo
and my husband, Pyo Jaehyun,

556
00:41:27,862 --> 00:41:29,280
along with me and Haesoo,

557
00:41:30,615 --> 00:41:34,911
we're all connected to
President Ko Taesun's case.

558
00:41:44,045 --> 00:41:46,715
FIRST PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE FOR
OFFICE OF THE 29TH PRESIDENT

559
00:41:46,798 --> 00:41:48,633
Pyo Jaehyun! Pyo Jaehyun!

560
00:41:48,717 --> 00:41:50,969
- He's here!
- Pyo Jaehyun!

561
00:41:51,052 --> 00:41:52,804
- Pyo Jaehyun! Pyo Jaehyun!
- We love you!

562
00:41:52,887 --> 00:41:56,808
Pyo Jaehyun! Pyo Jaehyun!

563
00:41:56,891 --> 00:41:59,477
<i>Pyo Jaehyun can never</i>
<i>become the president.</i>

564
00:42:00,061 --> 00:42:01,980
<i>I'm going to stop him, no matter what.</i>

565
00:42:02,063 --> 00:42:04,357
- Pyo Jaehyun! Pyo Jaehyun!
- Please step aside!

566
00:42:04,441 --> 00:42:07,152
The first question is for you,
Mr. Pyo.

567
00:42:07,902 --> 00:42:10,155
You said you have no connection

568
00:42:10,238 --> 00:42:13,366
to Director Kim Seondeok
of Hanwool Mental Hospital,

569
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:15,535
who recently passed. Is that true?

570
00:42:15,618 --> 00:42:18,538
I've already made my statement
to the people of Korea.

571
00:42:18,621 --> 00:42:23,043
Are you implying that you have
nothing to hide regarding this issue?

572
00:42:24,169 --> 00:42:28,465
Have you spoken among yourselves
to go on the offense regarding this?

573
00:42:28,548 --> 00:42:30,925
How impressive is his poise?

574
00:42:32,469 --> 00:42:36,056
You have to have guts like his
to get away with such lies.

575
00:42:36,139 --> 00:42:38,892
You almost had me fooled too, Mr. Pyo.

576
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:39,976
What do you mean?

577
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:42,562
Come on.
You know what the truth is.

578
00:42:42,645 --> 00:42:45,273
I'm well aware that Hatch and Hanwool

579
00:42:45,357 --> 00:42:48,276
had come to a partnership agreement
regarding human trials.

580
00:42:49,235 --> 00:42:52,155
Did you come here to conjure up
conspiracies without evidence?

581
00:42:52,947 --> 00:42:56,368
Please set an example
as a veteran politician, Mr. Han.

582
00:42:56,451 --> 00:42:58,787
That I will do.

583
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:03,416
I am a candidate who firmly believes
in the public's right to know.

584
00:43:05,919 --> 00:43:09,631
<i>Our hospital will provide</i>
<i>test subjects for your human trials.</i>

585
00:43:09,714 --> 00:43:12,342
<i>I'm sure you'll appreciate</i>
<i>our cooperation.</i>

586
00:43:12,425 --> 00:43:13,927
<i>Do you mean that?</i>

587
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:15,929
<i>The honor's all mine</i>

588
00:43:16,012 --> 00:43:18,848
<i>to get to work with a great talent</i>
<i>such as yourself.</i>

589
00:43:20,892 --> 00:43:22,852
HUMAN TRIALS
PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT

590
00:43:22,936 --> 00:43:25,355
- Human trials?
- Wow, I don't believe it.

591
00:43:25,438 --> 00:43:30,110
Human trials partnership agreement?

592
00:43:32,654 --> 00:43:36,491
Candidate Pyo, you are so handsome.

593
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:42,706
If someone with such a handsome face lies,
who wouldn't want to believe him?

594
00:43:43,415 --> 00:43:45,667
You are unbelievably brazen-faced.

595
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:48,128
People of Korea, take a look at this.

596
00:43:48,878 --> 00:43:50,922
Candidate Pyo hoodwinked us all.

597
00:43:51,631 --> 00:43:53,925
At times like these,
I lose faith in humanity.

598
00:43:55,719 --> 00:43:59,889
From what I recall,
Mr. Pyo stated that if we were to find

599
00:43:59,973 --> 00:44:02,726
the slightest disreputable connection
between them,

600
00:44:02,809 --> 00:44:05,729
he would immediately withdraw
his candidacy.

601
00:44:05,812 --> 00:44:10,316
Why don't you brazenly announce
your resignation here,

602
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,944
instead of holding
another press conference?

603
00:44:13,028 --> 00:44:15,488
SHOCKING LIE REVEALED.
WILL HE WITHDRAW CANDIDACY?

604
00:44:15,572 --> 00:44:18,366
<i>Mr. Han, you really</i>
<i>showed him today. Don't you agree?</i>

605
00:44:20,869 --> 00:44:22,662
<i>He knew everything all along,</i>

606
00:44:23,329 --> 00:44:27,000
<i>that I was the killer</i>
<i>and that Jang Kummo was the mastermind.</i>

607
00:44:29,044 --> 00:44:31,463
He already knew about the assassination?

608
00:44:33,882 --> 00:44:34,883
Did he sit back…

609
00:44:36,801 --> 00:44:38,636
and let it all play out on purpose?

610
00:44:48,813 --> 00:44:51,816
- We're looking into it.
- Of course he won't withdraw!

611
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:54,819
<i>Regarding Candidate Pyo's false claims…</i>

612
00:44:54,903 --> 00:44:56,738
You know what kind of man Mr. Pyo is.

613
00:44:56,821 --> 00:45:00,367
<i>…as a politician myself, I truly believe</i>
<i>we should take responsibility.</i>

614
00:45:00,992 --> 00:45:03,995
<i>I believe the only way to apologize</i>
<i>for deceiving the people</i>

615
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:05,955
<i>is the withdrawal</i>
<i>of Pyo Jaehyun's candidacy.</i>

<i>to express my respect to Mr. Han Kyungrok</i>

618
00:45:12,462 --> 00:45:14,255
<i>for bringing the truth to light.</i>

619
00:45:36,986 --> 00:45:37,987
Hey.

620
00:45:39,864 --> 00:45:40,865
Look at this.

621
00:45:44,369 --> 00:45:47,288
Oh, that son of a bitch.

622
00:45:47,372 --> 00:45:49,749
Taera's security guard is on Han's side.

623
00:45:49,833 --> 00:45:52,544
The police have closed his cases too.

624
00:45:54,754 --> 00:45:57,090
I was going to let it slide, but…

625
00:45:58,049 --> 00:46:01,386
Track his location.
See where he ran off to.

626
00:46:01,469 --> 00:46:02,887
Got it.

627
00:46:02,971 --> 00:46:03,972
I'll get going.

628
00:46:17,569 --> 00:46:18,653
Mr. Uhm, it's me.

629
00:46:20,905 --> 00:46:23,116
Taera's brother is nothing but trouble.

630
00:46:24,159 --> 00:46:25,368
Let's just kill him.

631
00:46:38,631 --> 00:46:40,216
Cha Pilseung is here.

632
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:42,093
- Go find him!
- Yes, sir.

633
00:47:00,028 --> 00:47:01,404
I'm going by myself?

634
00:47:03,156 --> 00:47:07,035
Mommy and Daddy have some things
to take care of.

635
00:47:07,118 --> 00:47:08,495
You'll be going alone.

636
00:47:09,496 --> 00:47:13,166
You'll make new friends in France,
and it's going to be so much fun.

637
00:47:13,667 --> 00:47:18,046
So when are you coming, Mommy?
How many nights do I have to count?

638
00:47:20,256 --> 00:47:22,050
It's going to take a long time.

639
00:47:23,259 --> 00:47:27,597
If you are good and brave in France,
Mommy will find you someday.

640
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:32,394
You'll be using a French name from now on.
Not Jiu, but Jeanne.

641
00:47:32,977 --> 00:47:34,020
No!

642
00:47:34,104 --> 00:47:37,607
Can I just stay here with Mommy and Daddy?

643
00:47:39,317 --> 00:47:41,903
Playing with Leo is more fun.

644
00:47:42,654 --> 00:47:44,572
I don't want to go to France.

645
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:50,161
Jiu…

646
00:47:52,247 --> 00:47:56,376
did you learn in kindergarten
what happens when you do something wrong?

647
00:47:57,252 --> 00:47:58,753
You face the consequences,

648
00:47:59,337 --> 00:48:02,173
and you have to apologize
to the person you've wronged.

649
00:48:04,342 --> 00:48:08,054
Mommy did something wrong,
so I have to face the consequences

650
00:48:08,847 --> 00:48:10,765
and apologize to this person.

651
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:14,477
So it's going to take some time.

652
00:48:15,061 --> 00:48:18,690
What did you do wrong?
Who do you have to apologize to?

653
00:48:19,524 --> 00:48:20,817
Auntie Haesoo.

654
00:48:22,402 --> 00:48:24,529
Mommy made a very big mistake.

655
00:48:24,612 --> 00:48:26,740
But Auntie is so nice.

656
00:48:26,823 --> 00:48:29,367
If you say you're sorry,
she'll forgive you.

657
00:48:30,285 --> 00:48:32,454
I'll go with you to apologize.

658
00:48:32,954 --> 00:48:35,457
Then I can stay here, right?

659
00:48:35,999 --> 00:48:38,793
And I don't have to go to France.

660
00:48:40,295 --> 00:48:41,755
No, Jiu.

661
00:48:41,838 --> 00:48:45,216
I'm going to be punished big time,
so I can't stay with you.

662
00:48:45,842 --> 00:48:47,594
So you have to go to France.

663
00:48:48,511 --> 00:48:51,765
Even if you miss me, just hang in there.
Can you do that for me?

664
00:48:51,848 --> 00:48:54,809
No! I don't want to go!

665
00:48:55,935 --> 00:48:57,103
Pyo Jiu,

666
00:48:57,187 --> 00:48:59,356
you're not a baby anymore.
You're a big girl now.

667
00:48:59,439 --> 00:49:02,734
No! I'm still a baby!

668
00:49:02,817 --> 00:49:05,945
I want to live with Mommy!

669
00:49:10,283 --> 00:49:11,284
Jiu,

670
00:49:11,785 --> 00:49:13,453
you have to be strong now.

671
00:49:14,204 --> 00:49:16,664
You need to be able to do things
on your own.

672
00:49:17,332 --> 00:49:19,918
It's going to get harder and scarier,

673
00:49:20,001 --> 00:49:23,254
but you have to stay strong.

674
00:49:27,592 --> 00:49:30,929
Sweetie, just remember one thing.

675
00:49:34,224 --> 00:49:35,934
Mommy loves you…

676
00:49:38,019 --> 00:49:40,522
to the moon and back.

677
00:49:45,151 --> 00:49:46,152
When you get older

678
00:49:47,904 --> 00:49:49,948
and find out things about Mommy,

679
00:49:51,741 --> 00:49:53,702
don't let it hurt you too much,

680
00:49:55,495 --> 00:49:57,122
and don't hate me too much.

681
00:49:59,582 --> 00:50:02,168
Mommy!

682
00:50:28,194 --> 00:50:30,113
What happened to your hand?

683
00:50:30,196 --> 00:50:31,197
It's nothing.

684
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:40,290
Mother, Father,
I'm here with Hajun.

685
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:45,170
We're sorry it took 20 years
to move your remains here.

686
00:50:46,254 --> 00:50:49,674
We moved you to a nice place.
Forgive us for taking so long,

687
00:50:50,675 --> 00:50:51,676
Mom and Dad.

688
00:50:55,972 --> 00:50:57,807
I have another favor to ask, Hajun.

689
00:51:01,936 --> 00:51:03,855
Passports for you and Jiu.

690
00:51:03,938 --> 00:51:06,775
You won't have issues leaving Korea,
so don't worry.

691
00:51:07,901 --> 00:51:10,820
Once you get to France,
someone will be waiting for you.

692
00:51:12,405 --> 00:51:13,823
You can trust her.

693
00:51:13,907 --> 00:51:17,410
She cared for me and Yura like family
when we lived in France.

694
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:22,957
Take good care of Jiu. She'll be scared.

695
00:51:24,376 --> 00:51:26,127
Make sure she doesn't call her dad.

696
00:51:26,211 --> 00:51:27,921
Will you be all right on your own?

697
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:30,507
You really think this is the only way?

698
00:51:32,384 --> 00:51:36,638
For now, nothing matters more to me
than Jiu's safety.

699
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:39,015
Don't ever leave her alone.

700
00:51:43,186 --> 00:51:44,479
Jiu

701
00:51:45,397 --> 00:51:46,398
is your niece.

702
00:52:04,457 --> 00:52:07,502
Be careful, Hajun. Take good care of Jiu.

703
00:52:31,943 --> 00:52:33,111
I'm sorry, Jiu.

704
00:52:34,821 --> 00:52:35,989
I'm so sorry.

705
00:52:38,992 --> 00:52:40,577
Mommy's so sorry.

706
00:53:21,826 --> 00:53:22,869
You…

707
00:53:23,912 --> 00:53:25,872
PRESIDENT KO TAESUN'S
INAUGURATION DAY 15 YEARS AGO

708
00:53:25,955 --> 00:53:27,540
resent me quite a bit, don't you?

709
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:30,335
I understand.

710
00:53:30,418 --> 00:53:32,504
You're in a tough spot.

711
00:53:33,797 --> 00:53:36,466
I'm sure you had to drag your feet
to get here today,

712
00:53:37,384 --> 00:53:40,845
knowing prosecution will look into
Kumjo Group after the inauguration.

713
00:53:40,929 --> 00:53:43,932
- Why would you want to congratulate me?
- It's not like that.

714
00:53:46,601 --> 00:53:48,061
I'm so happy for you.

715
00:53:49,771 --> 00:53:55,402
Why does that matter when my best friend
is about to become president?

716
00:53:55,485 --> 00:53:56,486
I, too,

717
00:53:57,946 --> 00:54:02,325
will fully cooperate in the investigation
and stand tall before you.

718
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:07,872
I'll stop the prosecutors.

719
00:54:08,832 --> 00:54:11,543
In return, drop the Daehan Bridge project.

720
00:54:12,043 --> 00:54:13,378
Even without that project,

721
00:54:14,045 --> 00:54:16,589
there are other ways to save Kumjo Group.

722
00:54:18,550 --> 00:54:19,759
What's this about?

723
00:54:19,843 --> 00:54:22,637
I think I'd been too harsh on you.

724
00:54:22,721 --> 00:54:27,142
After all, it's my first time
in such a high position.

725
00:54:29,436 --> 00:54:30,895
I was just being very cautious.

726
00:54:35,066 --> 00:54:36,443
I ask for one favor,

727
00:54:36,985 --> 00:54:37,986
my friend.

728
00:54:39,404 --> 00:54:42,741
Let this be the first and the last time
I turn a blind eye to you.

729
00:54:48,913 --> 00:54:50,665
Sir, it's time to go.

730
00:55:14,022 --> 00:55:15,023
Don't do it.

731
00:55:18,068 --> 00:55:19,319
Stop it immediately.

732
00:55:21,988 --> 00:55:23,156
Tell them to stop!

733
00:55:50,725 --> 00:55:53,436
This was all your doing.

734
00:55:56,314 --> 00:55:57,774
You're taking

735
00:55:58,858 --> 00:56:00,610
full responsibility for everything.

736
00:56:02,987 --> 00:56:07,200
If you can't do it yourself,
let me help you.

737
00:56:14,541 --> 00:56:16,960
STOCK WAIVER AGREEMENT
RECIPIENT: JANG KYOJIN

738
00:56:32,976 --> 00:56:35,020
What goes around comes around.

739
00:56:39,274 --> 00:56:40,400
Younghwee.

740
00:56:41,651 --> 00:56:43,069
Min Younghwee.

741
00:56:44,654 --> 00:56:47,449
Younghwee. Min Younghwee.

742
00:57:34,913 --> 00:57:37,332
<i>Shocked by the hypocrisy</i>
<i>of Pyo Jaehyun,</i>

743
00:57:37,415 --> 00:57:39,417
<i>supporters have turned their backs on him,</i>

744
00:57:39,501 --> 00:57:42,212
<i>and the nation is condemning</i>
<i>the disgraced candidate.</i>

745
00:57:42,712 --> 00:57:46,883
<i>The biggest scandal of this election</i>
<i>is Pyo's prospective withdrawal.</i>

746
00:57:47,550 --> 00:57:50,762
<i>What choice will he make?</i>

747
00:57:53,223 --> 00:57:54,891
Goodness.

748
00:57:54,974 --> 00:57:57,227
How dare these bastards mess with me.

749
00:57:59,020 --> 00:58:01,106
Don't they know who I am?

750
00:58:50,947 --> 00:58:52,615
Hello. Mr. Park?

751
00:58:53,533 --> 00:58:55,326
This is Cha Pilseung.

752
00:58:55,410 --> 00:58:56,870
I was Hong Taera's security.

753
00:58:56,953 --> 00:58:59,497
Yes? What's the matter?

754
00:59:01,583 --> 00:59:03,793
The one who killed you father…

755
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:07,005
was me, not Hong Taera.

756
00:59:09,591 --> 00:59:12,886
<i>Hong Taera-- No,</i>
<i>No. 50 is my sister.</i>

757
00:59:13,386 --> 00:59:15,847
<i>She took the fall for my sins.</i>

758
00:59:16,348 --> 00:59:18,099
She didn't do anything wrong.

759
00:59:19,851 --> 00:59:22,645
I'm sorry for telling you now, Ms. Ko.

760
00:59:28,151 --> 00:59:30,111
<i>I don't want to hear it.</i>

761
00:59:31,571 --> 00:59:33,198
I said I don't want to hear it!

762
00:59:46,670 --> 00:59:50,840
I'm fed up with both you and Hong Taera!
You think "sorry" is enough?

763
00:59:51,341 --> 00:59:54,594
Is your apology going to bring back
my parents?

764
00:59:55,679 --> 00:59:57,597
This whole time, you said nothing.

765
00:59:57,681 --> 01:00:01,267
What am I supposed to believe
when both of you tell me you killed him?

766
01:00:01,351 --> 01:00:03,061
I'm not asking for forgiveness!

767
01:00:05,146 --> 01:00:07,440
Direct your hate toward me. Only me.

768
01:00:09,693 --> 01:00:11,778
Hong Taera is taking the fall for my sins

769
01:00:11,861 --> 01:00:15,115
and will reveal her identity as No. 50
to the world, like a fool,

770
01:00:16,032 --> 01:00:18,118
so she can take down Pyo Jaehyun

771
01:00:19,577 --> 01:00:21,454
and to protect you from getting hurt.

772
01:00:24,666 --> 01:00:28,128
We didn't have a choice back then.

773
01:00:29,921 --> 01:00:33,133
We were incapable of thinking
about the terrible things we were doing.

774
01:00:58,575 --> 01:00:59,743
Haesoo,

775
01:01:01,244 --> 01:01:02,495
what happened to you?

776
01:01:03,455 --> 01:01:04,622
What are you doing here?

777
01:01:08,918 --> 01:01:10,295
Jaehyun,

778
01:01:12,130 --> 01:01:14,132
how could you do this to me?

779
01:01:17,302 --> 01:01:18,970
What do you mean?

780
01:01:21,598 --> 01:01:22,974
Dojin…

781
01:01:25,268 --> 01:01:27,270
Dojin tried to have me killed.

782
01:01:32,233 --> 01:01:33,234
What?

783
01:01:34,027 --> 01:01:36,029
I barely got away.

784
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:39,282
Please help me, Jaehyun.

785
01:02:24,011 --> 01:02:26,838
PANDORA: BENEATH THE PARADISE

786
01:02:45,056 --> 01:02:48,143
I already know that Taera killed
my father that day.

787
01:02:48,226 --> 01:02:49,728
<i>She had you fooled too, didn't she?</i>

788
01:02:49,811 --> 01:02:51,521
Where's my daughter?

789
01:02:51,604 --> 01:02:52,897
Withdraw from candidacy.

<i>You really want to live,</i>
<i>don't you?</i>

791
01:02:54,899 --> 01:02:57,944
I don't feel like killing you yet, Father.

<i>I'm going to survive</i>

01:03:00,238 --> 01:03:03,867
The things I'd done to get my hands on it.

794
01:03:03,950 --> 01:03:07,829

<i>Our only concern now</i>

797
01:03:11,797 --> 01:03:15,509
is to figure out how to kill the bastards
who cornered us into this miserable fate.
