2
00:00:29,406 --> 00:00:30,866
You're back, Ms. Hong.

3
00:00:41,669 --> 00:00:42,670
Pyo Jaehyun.

4
00:00:42,753 --> 00:00:44,296
I told you to do nothing.

5
00:00:54,974 --> 00:00:56,934
INCOMING CALL
KYOJIN

6
00:00:57,017 --> 00:00:58,018
Jang Kyojin?

7
00:01:03,774 --> 00:01:06,026
EPISODE 13

8
00:01:07,653 --> 00:01:11,949
Kyojin, I made your favorite,
doraji-jeonggwa.

9
00:01:14,118 --> 00:01:15,369
I have somewhere to be.

10
00:01:16,287 --> 00:01:17,913
Where to? What's happened?

11
00:01:17,997 --> 00:01:19,999
I think Taera found Sujeong.

12
00:01:20,082 --> 00:01:21,500
I need to confirm it's her.

13
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:23,794
Don't go, Kyojin. It's dangerous.

14
00:01:23,877 --> 00:01:26,797
All the more reason to go.
I can't leave Taera alone.

15
00:02:38,077 --> 00:02:39,078
Taera?

16
00:02:43,957 --> 00:02:44,958
Taera?

17
00:03:02,267 --> 00:03:03,268
Yes, Haesoo.

18
00:03:03,352 --> 00:03:05,062
<i>I can't reach Taera.</i>

19
00:03:05,938 --> 00:03:07,523
She's disappeared.

20
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,636
Microchip insertion isn't safe to do yet.

21
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:40,013
Let's halt Project Eraser for now,
Sujeong.

22
00:03:44,935 --> 00:03:45,936
Go on.

23
00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:48,772
It's too dangerous, Chairman.

24
00:03:48,856 --> 00:03:51,692
You know her life will be at risk
if we insert the microchip.

25
00:03:52,568 --> 00:03:55,988
She could have seizures,
and her memory distortion will get worse...

26
00:03:56,071 --> 00:03:57,114
We'll give her meds.

27
00:03:57,197 --> 00:03:59,450
That issue's unconfirmed.
Its effects vary.

28
00:03:59,533 --> 00:04:01,618
Her brain could explode
like it did with Red...

29
00:04:01,702 --> 00:04:02,828
I know, I know!

30
00:04:04,413 --> 00:04:05,914
Even if it's just for a while,

31
00:04:07,207 --> 00:04:10,794
I want to be happy with Taera,
like we were before.

32
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:12,921
Please... Please reconsider...

33
00:04:13,005 --> 00:04:14,840
I can't keep living in this hell.

34
00:04:14,923 --> 00:04:17,968
Let's erase Taera's memory.

35
00:04:37,488 --> 00:04:38,739
We're connected. Begin.

36
00:04:48,081 --> 00:04:50,250
DELETE MEMORIES?
YES, NO

37
00:04:50,334 --> 00:04:51,585
Don't worry, Taera.

38
00:04:52,419 --> 00:04:54,713
Everything will return
to its rightful place.

39
00:04:55,714 --> 00:04:57,508
Let's go back to our happy days.

40
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:59,760
Trust me.

41
00:05:02,721 --> 00:05:05,891
DELETE MEMORIES?
YES, NO

42
00:05:41,385 --> 00:05:42,678
Taera!

43
00:05:49,977 --> 00:05:51,228
Taera!

44
00:06:10,163 --> 00:06:11,748
What did you want with him?

45
00:06:11,832 --> 00:06:13,125
None of your business.

46
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:15,377
What's going on?
I need to know to help you.

47
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,837
Help me with what?

48
00:06:17,421 --> 00:06:19,631
Didn't you just threaten me
with divorce action?

49
00:06:20,465 --> 00:06:22,426
I did it to buy time!

50
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:28,557
If we get divorced,
it'll really be over between us, no?

51
00:06:29,683 --> 00:06:32,477
You'll never see me again, will you?

52
00:06:39,151 --> 00:06:42,487
I'm not asking you to live with me.
I am ashamed, you know.

53
00:06:42,571 --> 00:06:45,907
I know how cowardly and despicable I am.

54
00:06:45,991 --> 00:06:50,329
But I'm worried sick about you.

55
00:06:51,747 --> 00:06:57,085
I'm so worried you might get hurt
that it's affecting everything I do.

56
00:07:00,255 --> 00:07:01,256
Can I…

57
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:04,092
at least for once…

58
00:07:06,219 --> 00:07:07,638
be someone you need?

59
00:07:11,308 --> 00:07:14,770
I'm dying here.
The least you can do is resent me!

60
00:07:26,531 --> 00:07:27,532
I think Jaehyun…

61
00:07:29,785 --> 00:07:31,536
did something to Taera.

62
00:07:35,707 --> 00:07:36,708
Help me.

63
00:07:47,678 --> 00:07:49,471
Who said I'd do this interview?

64
00:07:49,554 --> 00:07:52,182
I've no interest in publicly endorsing
your campaign.

65
00:07:52,808 --> 00:07:55,894
Thanks to me, Kumjo Group's stock
increased severalfold, no?

66
00:07:56,395 --> 00:07:58,814
You'll be well received
at the shareholders' meeting.

67
00:07:58,897 --> 00:08:00,107
Or do you not like that?

68
00:08:02,651 --> 00:08:05,070
Out of anyone at Hatch,
the spotlight's on you.

69
00:08:05,612 --> 00:08:07,906
The board is considering making you CEO.

70
00:08:07,989 --> 00:08:09,658
Of course, I've agreed to it too.

71
00:08:09,741 --> 00:08:13,161
Didn't you mock me
for how unqualified I was?

72
00:08:13,912 --> 00:08:18,959
Hey, I don't want to be CEO.
Even if you hand it to me, I'll pass.

73
00:08:19,042 --> 00:08:22,671
Why are you both so on edge?
We're friends, aren't we?

74
00:08:25,716 --> 00:08:28,885
If you're so displeased with me,
off with my head already.

75
00:08:29,928 --> 00:08:30,929
Except,

76
00:08:32,305 --> 00:08:34,975
you better be prepared
to lose everything you have.

77
00:08:35,851 --> 00:08:36,977
Is that what you want?

78
00:08:42,274 --> 00:08:45,026
Kyojin is still looking for Sujeong.
Did you know that?

79
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,488
Say what we did gets exposed.

80
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,825
Then we're all screwed, for real.

81
00:08:55,036 --> 00:08:56,496
I won't ask for your friendship.

82
00:08:57,164 --> 00:09:00,083
I just want us to be accomplices.
A perfect partnership.

83
00:09:04,463 --> 00:09:05,464
Take your pick.

84
00:09:06,506 --> 00:09:10,218
Either we all die together
or we all survive together.

85
00:09:17,851 --> 00:09:23,607
Currently, Hatch has been
conducting smart patch clinical trials

86
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:25,901
on critically ill patients.

87
00:09:29,488 --> 00:09:32,282
Kumjo Group and Hatch
have a cordial business relationship.

88
00:09:32,365 --> 00:09:34,701
The research I've conducted at Hatch

89
00:09:34,785 --> 00:09:38,163
will be utilized by Kumjo Group's
Brain Sciences Research Lab.

90
00:09:38,663 --> 00:09:44,044
My friends and I founded Hatch on passion,
so seeing it succeed truly moves my heart.

91
00:09:45,128 --> 00:09:48,882
I'm happy and relieved
to be able to focus on the election.

KOO SUNGCHAN, CEO

96
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,318
<i>Yes, Mr. CEO.</i>

97
00:10:10,987 --> 00:10:12,113
What'd you say?

98
00:10:12,197 --> 00:10:13,573
<i>Pardon, Mr. CEO?</i>

99
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,536
Wh... What did you just call me?

100
00:10:18,119 --> 00:10:19,913
<i>Mr. CEO, of course, sir.</i>

101
00:10:22,332 --> 00:10:26,253
So, I... I'm...

102
00:10:26,336 --> 00:10:29,756
The CE... CEO. Yes, that's me!

103
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:35,804
I am Hatch's CEO, Koo Sungchan! Me…

104
00:10:44,354 --> 00:10:45,981
Haven't seen Taera much lately.

105
00:10:46,064 --> 00:10:48,608
She not campaigning with you?
Election's coming up, no?

106
00:10:48,692 --> 00:10:52,028
I haven't seen her in a while either.
Or Jiu.

107
00:10:52,112 --> 00:10:54,614
Jiu's on a trip and Taera is unwell.

108
00:10:56,116 --> 00:10:59,244
You know my wife's been having
memory problems. It's gotten worse again.

109
00:10:59,327 --> 00:11:02,998
How could it get worse?
She's never remembered her past, no?

110
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:08,169
Perhaps it's the stress, but she's having
short-term memory issues.

111
00:11:08,253 --> 00:11:10,130
She's in treatment,
so she'll get well soon.

112
00:11:14,259 --> 00:11:17,304
I don't believe it. She was fine.
Why would she be sick now?

113
00:11:18,722 --> 00:11:21,016
Jaehyun must have done something to her.

114
00:11:21,099 --> 00:11:22,851
I'll go ask him myself.

115
00:11:22,934 --> 00:11:23,935
Wait...

116
00:11:24,811 --> 00:11:27,272
We haven't even located her yet.

117
00:11:27,355 --> 00:11:30,901
If we mess with Jaehyun rashly,
Taera's safety may be compromised.

118
00:11:31,401 --> 00:11:32,694
Then what do we do?

119
00:11:32,777 --> 00:11:35,071
You want me to just sit back and wait?

120
00:11:36,489 --> 00:11:37,741
I'll look into it.

121
00:11:38,325 --> 00:11:39,826
Oh, right.

122
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:43,288
Just pretend you know nothing
for now, okay?

123
00:11:57,886 --> 00:11:58,929
Go ahead.

124
00:12:06,937 --> 00:12:09,439
- What's this?
- You can't go in, ma'am.

125
00:12:09,522 --> 00:12:12,108
- Move.
- You're prohibited from entering, Ms. Ko.

126
00:12:29,501 --> 00:12:30,752
You feel all right?

127
00:12:32,629 --> 00:12:33,922
What happened?

128
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:37,467
You're here too, Dr. Kang.

129
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:40,387
You fell and hurt your head
at your sister's boutique.

130
00:12:40,971 --> 00:12:42,097
Don't you remember?

131
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:44,474
I fell?

132
00:12:47,185 --> 00:12:49,479
<i>Oh, I remember.</i>

133
00:12:51,731 --> 00:12:53,316
How long was I out?

134
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,026
Quite a long time.

135
00:12:56,569 --> 00:12:57,570
And?

136
00:12:58,905 --> 00:13:00,198
Remember anything else?

137
00:13:01,908 --> 00:13:02,909
No.

138
00:13:04,619 --> 00:13:07,080
Nothing after the incident
at Yura's boutique.

139
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:11,543
You can take your time.
Don't stress over it.

140
00:13:13,962 --> 00:13:15,839
I'm so relieved you're awake, Taera.

141
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,968
- Where's Jiu?
- She's on a trip.

142
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,053
She'll be back soon.

143
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:29,686
Wow, we're home!

144
00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:31,396
Aren't you happy to be home, Uncle?

145
00:13:32,022 --> 00:13:33,023
Yeah.

146
00:13:34,482 --> 00:13:35,817
Shall we go home, Jiu?

147
00:13:36,401 --> 00:13:37,527
Let's go, Uncle.

148
00:13:56,588 --> 00:13:58,048
<i>Mommy!</i>

149
00:13:58,631 --> 00:14:00,842
- Jiu, you're home.
- I'm home.

150
00:14:00,925 --> 00:14:03,678
You don't know how much I missed you.

151
00:14:03,762 --> 00:14:05,972
Didn't you miss me, Mommy?

152
00:14:06,556 --> 00:14:08,183
Of course I missed you!

153
00:14:08,767 --> 00:14:12,270
- Daddy, Jiu's home!
- Yes, my darling.

154
00:14:12,854 --> 00:14:16,024
You've gotten prettier.
Daddy missed you so much.

155
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,027
Who did you go with? Auntie Yura?

156
00:14:20,153 --> 00:14:21,321
Auntie?

157
00:14:21,404 --> 00:14:24,074
Auntie Yura is dead.

158
00:14:28,536 --> 00:14:29,871
What is she talking about?

159
00:14:29,954 --> 00:14:31,122
I'll explain.

160
00:14:31,664 --> 00:14:34,084
Why don't we go unpack first?

161
00:14:34,167 --> 00:14:36,419
Ms. Yoo, could you help Jiu unpack?

162
00:14:37,045 --> 00:14:38,046
Go on, Jiu.

163
00:14:42,801 --> 00:14:47,597
Honey. W... Why? When?

164
00:14:51,476 --> 00:14:53,728
I don't remember anything at all.

165
00:14:53,812 --> 00:14:56,564
Yura committed suicide.

166
00:14:59,818 --> 00:15:00,902
Suicide?

167
00:15:00,985 --> 00:15:03,404
No way. She was such a cheerful person.

168
00:15:03,488 --> 00:15:07,200
Tell me it's not true.

169
00:15:07,283 --> 00:15:10,203
It's all right, Taera.
I'll tell you.

170
00:15:11,287 --> 00:15:13,123
I'll tell you everything that happened…

171
00:15:14,165 --> 00:15:15,166
to you.

172
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:32,684
You were traumatized by Yura's death.

173
00:15:33,601 --> 00:15:36,271
Dr. Kang thinks your brain suppressed
those memories

174
00:15:36,813 --> 00:15:38,273
as a protective mechanism.

175
00:15:40,191 --> 00:15:41,442
I can't believe it.

176
00:15:42,026 --> 00:15:43,278
It'll be hard to accept.

177
00:15:44,112 --> 00:15:45,363
I'll be here if you need.

178
00:15:45,446 --> 00:15:47,657
Don't suffer alone.
You can always lean on me.

179
00:15:49,284 --> 00:15:50,285
Thank you.

180
00:15:52,871 --> 00:15:53,997
Oh, right.

181
00:15:55,123 --> 00:15:58,626
Dr. Kang earnestly requested
that you don't skip your medication.

182
00:16:13,516 --> 00:16:14,851
Mommy!

183
00:16:16,102 --> 00:16:18,229
I want to sleep here tonight.

184
00:16:18,313 --> 00:16:21,774
I cried every night
because I wanted to sleep next to you.

185
00:16:21,858 --> 00:16:23,401
MR. JO

186
00:16:23,484 --> 00:16:26,196
You had to leave home
for Mommy's sake. Mommy's sorry.

187
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:27,280
One moment.

188
00:16:31,993 --> 00:16:33,161
What of No. 105?

189
00:16:33,661 --> 00:16:35,663
I'm talking to him now.

190
00:16:35,747 --> 00:16:37,040
Pyo Jaehyun!

191
00:16:37,624 --> 00:16:40,960
I'm going to kill you.
Don't you dare do anything to my sis...

192
00:16:41,753 --> 00:16:43,046
How dare you, traitor.

193
00:16:44,631 --> 00:16:46,925
We have a healthy sample for a change.

194
00:16:47,008 --> 00:16:48,384
Take him to room six.

195
00:16:49,385 --> 00:16:50,428
Yes, sir.

196
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:53,973
Bring him up. Quietly.

197
00:16:57,644 --> 00:16:58,686
YBC NEWS

198
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:00,855
<i>Is the election a joke to you, Mr. Pyo?</i>

199
00:17:01,856 --> 00:17:03,107
Candidate Pyo.

200
00:17:03,191 --> 00:17:07,528
You acted like you'd resign immediately,
what with your devoted husband act.

201
00:17:07,612 --> 00:17:10,740
But now that Hatch is on the rise,
you wag your tail back here

202
00:17:10,823 --> 00:17:12,909
to take advantage of this favorable
atmosphere?

203
00:17:14,494 --> 00:17:17,664
Even community leader elections
aren't so nonsensical!

204
00:17:17,747 --> 00:17:19,332
Withdraw immediately!

205
00:17:19,415 --> 00:17:21,251
Please don't make rash remarks
about Hatch.

206
00:17:21,834 --> 00:17:23,628
Whether I become president or not,

207
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:26,506
I'm certain Hatch
will make this country flourish.

208
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:28,967
Please refrain from speaking
against national interest.

209
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:30,343
L... Look at this!

210
00:17:30,426 --> 00:17:33,513
This is a clear violation
of the election law.

211
00:17:33,596 --> 00:17:35,974
He dared show up at the Hatch presentation

212
00:17:36,057 --> 00:17:37,767
to act like its owner.

213
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,018
A presidential candidate

214
00:17:39,102 --> 00:17:42,021
can't be the largest shareholder
of a conglomerate company!

215
00:17:42,105 --> 00:17:44,482
This is clearly a political collusion!

216
00:17:44,565 --> 00:17:46,192
So what is it you wish to say?

217
00:17:46,276 --> 00:17:49,696
Set up a blind trust
for your Hatch shares,

218
00:17:49,779 --> 00:17:51,614
and draw the line with Hatch!

219
00:17:51,698 --> 00:17:54,617
If you can't do that,
just give up on your candidacy!

220
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:57,912
You're being way too greedy,
Candidate Pyo!

221
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:02,667
You clearly haven't taken much interest
in me lately.

222
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,960
What did you say?

223
00:18:04,043 --> 00:18:07,505
The shares my family and I own
are already taken care of.

224
00:18:07,588 --> 00:18:10,008
I've yielded some to my employees
as a partial transfer.

225
00:18:10,091 --> 00:18:12,176
The rest are up for sale to the public.

226
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:14,637
- Up for sale?
- Yes.

227
00:18:14,721 --> 00:18:17,849
I wanted to share Hatch's success
with the people.

228
00:18:21,269 --> 00:18:22,353
My fellow Koreans,

229
00:18:22,437 --> 00:18:25,481
I, Pyo Jaehyun,
will take you to the future.

230
00:18:29,444 --> 00:18:30,903
5 DAYS TO ELECTION DAY

231
00:18:57,805 --> 00:18:59,515
Mommy!

232
00:19:00,224 --> 00:19:02,769
Wow, Jiu. You look so pretty today.

233
00:19:02,852 --> 00:19:05,355
We haven't been to a party in so long.

234
00:19:05,438 --> 00:19:10,360
Let me introduce to you all:
this is my beloved wife, Hong Taera.

235
00:19:17,533 --> 00:19:21,704
Been a while since I felt so stoked.
Don't you agree?

236
00:19:21,788 --> 00:19:24,457
I'm getting wasted as hell today.

237
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,918
Shall we have a drink, President Pyo?

238
00:19:27,001 --> 00:19:28,503
You're overdoing it again.

239
00:19:28,586 --> 00:19:32,632
You're in the public's favor
for this election. Come on, admit it.

240
00:19:33,216 --> 00:19:35,385
What? Am I the only one who thinks so?

241
00:19:35,885 --> 00:19:38,096
What does our first lady think?

242
00:19:39,806 --> 00:19:41,641
Your assessment sounds uplifting.

243
00:19:41,724 --> 00:19:43,059
Right?

244
00:19:43,142 --> 00:19:44,727
What'd I say, dude?

245
00:19:45,311 --> 00:19:48,773
Hey, behave yourself.
You're the CEO of Hatch now.

246
00:19:48,856 --> 00:19:50,817
- We have many eyes watching.
- Damn.

247
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,152
Being CEO sure is a pain in the ass.

248
00:19:58,449 --> 00:20:00,660
By the way, where did Haesoo go?

249
00:20:07,542 --> 00:20:08,876
I'll go bring Haesoo.

250
00:20:11,796 --> 00:20:15,258
You're filthy rich,
practically conglomerate royalty.

251
00:20:15,341 --> 00:20:18,636
Just give her the alimony
and call it quits.

252
00:20:19,137 --> 00:20:21,556
Isn't it uncomfortable living
under one roof?

253
00:20:26,769 --> 00:20:27,895
Hi, Leo.

254
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,484
Go play with Jiu.

255
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:35,862
Jiu!

256
00:20:37,113 --> 00:20:39,657
What're you doing here alone?
Everyone's having a drink.

257
00:20:42,285 --> 00:20:44,787
Taera, are you okay?

258
00:20:46,622 --> 00:20:50,126
What do you mean? Of course I'm okay.

259
00:20:50,209 --> 00:20:53,838
Such a great day. I'm so happy.
I couldn't be happier.

260
00:20:54,589 --> 00:20:55,882
You're happy?

261
00:20:56,924 --> 00:20:59,093
How can you be happy right now?

262
00:20:59,677 --> 00:21:01,387
You forget all we talked about?

263
00:21:03,014 --> 00:21:04,182
Haesoo.

264
00:21:04,974 --> 00:21:07,393
Jaehyun did something to you. Didn't he?

265
00:21:07,477 --> 00:21:09,353
What're you two talking about?

266
00:21:11,397 --> 00:21:13,900
Oh, Haesoo just said something strange.

267
00:21:14,484 --> 00:21:17,528
What? She say I did something bad to you?

268
00:21:23,242 --> 00:21:24,577
Ms. Hong.

269
00:21:27,497 --> 00:21:30,041
Could you select some photos
for the press release?

270
00:21:30,124 --> 00:21:31,501
Sure.

271
00:21:31,584 --> 00:21:33,044
Come along soon.

272
00:21:33,127 --> 00:21:34,128
Shall we?

273
00:21:36,506 --> 00:21:38,216
Did you hypnotize her or something?

274
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,009
What happened?

275
00:21:40,092 --> 00:21:42,094
She can't remember anything from before.

276
00:21:42,845 --> 00:21:44,138
What should she remember?

277
00:21:45,389 --> 00:21:46,807
That she's a killer?

278
00:21:47,975 --> 00:21:52,021
Or that you two plotted
to take revenge against me?

279
00:21:53,898 --> 00:21:54,899
What?

280
00:21:55,525 --> 00:21:57,151
Did you think I wouldn't know?

281
00:21:59,487 --> 00:22:03,658
You dared to work with Taera
and pretend to help me?

282
00:22:05,368 --> 00:22:07,495
Uhm died needlessly because of you.

283
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:11,249
His death is on you.

284
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:14,794
You've made a habit
of killing people you don't need.

285
00:22:15,795 --> 00:22:16,796
So?

286
00:22:17,713 --> 00:22:19,131
You going to kill Taera too?

287
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,801
Kill Taera?

288
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,263
I'm trying to save her from herself.

289
00:22:26,389 --> 00:22:29,183
Would she be happy
if she knew the uncomfortable truth?

290
00:22:29,684 --> 00:22:32,395
You should know.
You lived in misery for 15 years.

291
00:22:32,478 --> 00:22:33,479
Pyo Jaehyun...

292
00:22:33,563 --> 00:22:36,065
Taera's forgotten it all.
She knows none of that now.

293
00:22:36,148 --> 00:22:39,360
So forget about tormenting her
by bringing up the past.

294
00:22:40,528 --> 00:22:41,821
Right.

295
00:22:42,488 --> 00:22:45,199
Judging by your friendly texts with Taera,

296
00:22:45,992 --> 00:22:47,660
it seems you've forgiven her, no?

297
00:22:49,704 --> 00:22:50,955
Who…

298
00:22:51,747 --> 00:22:52,999
Who the hell are you?

299
00:22:53,583 --> 00:22:54,584
Me?

300
00:22:55,501 --> 00:22:57,587
I'm Jang Kummo's victim, just like you.

301
00:22:58,713 --> 00:23:01,507
Which is why
I won't stop your revenge against him.

302
00:23:02,091 --> 00:23:05,928
However, don't even think
about getting close to my wife.

303
00:23:06,721 --> 00:23:08,139
Am I clear?

304
00:23:12,226 --> 00:23:15,229
It's been so long
since we've heard laughter here.

305
00:23:17,648 --> 00:23:19,483
It's time you forgot about the past.

306
00:23:20,151 --> 00:23:23,237
Dojin must've been pretty sick of you
if he chose to leave you.

307
00:23:28,367 --> 00:23:29,660
Son of a bitch.

308
00:23:35,124 --> 00:23:36,626
What about this photo?

309
00:23:36,709 --> 00:23:39,337
I think it's great.
Let's go with this one.

310
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,421
Yes, ma'am.

311
00:23:41,464 --> 00:23:42,465
Yeah.

312
00:23:43,966 --> 00:23:45,885
Kyojin!

313
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,721
Taera.

314
00:23:49,305 --> 00:23:50,306
Goodness.

315
00:23:50,389 --> 00:23:52,058
You look so healthy.

316
00:23:52,141 --> 00:23:53,893
You haven't changed in seven years.

317
00:23:53,976 --> 00:23:55,394
You okay?

318
00:23:55,478 --> 00:23:57,897
I was so worried.
I couldn't reach you since that day.

319
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:58,981
That day?

320
00:23:59,065 --> 00:24:01,817
We were supposed to meet at Dr. Yang's...

321
00:24:01,901 --> 00:24:03,069
Don't you remember?

322
00:24:03,736 --> 00:24:06,864
What are you talking about?
I think you're mistaken about something.

323
00:24:06,947 --> 00:24:08,783
- Taera, that day...
- Kyojin, you came.

324
00:24:10,618 --> 00:24:12,828
You okay, honey?
You went out of your way today.

325
00:24:12,912 --> 00:24:14,038
I'm okay.

326
00:24:14,121 --> 00:24:16,540
You look much better
than what Jaehyun said.

327
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:18,501
It's good to see you.

328
00:24:20,127 --> 00:24:21,212
- Taera.
- Kyojin.

329
00:24:23,464 --> 00:24:26,884
Don't push it.
You barely managed to revive yourself.

330
00:24:33,182 --> 00:24:35,893
- What's so funny?
- The people earlier…

331
00:24:39,897 --> 00:24:42,024
Is this what you wanted?

332
00:24:42,108 --> 00:24:45,194
Dojin joined forces with Jaehyun
to take over Kumjo.

333
00:24:45,277 --> 00:24:48,072
You know better than anyone
what kind of man Jaehyun he is!

334
00:24:48,656 --> 00:24:49,657
What?

335
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,535
You want to criticize me too?

336
00:24:53,911 --> 00:24:57,081
Fine. Mock me and say it served me right.

337
00:24:58,165 --> 00:25:00,668
Call me an imbecile.

338
00:25:03,462 --> 00:25:05,214
Attend the shareholders' meeting.

339
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:09,301
Then announce that
you're yielding your shares to me.

340
00:25:09,385 --> 00:25:11,095
Have you gone mad?

341
00:25:11,178 --> 00:25:13,514
Your mother stole them from me,

342
00:25:13,597 --> 00:25:16,559
but Kumjo's chairman seat
is for Dojin's to take!

343
00:25:16,642 --> 00:25:19,353
Do you really want me to destroy Kumjo?

344
00:25:22,231 --> 00:25:23,941
See you on the day.

345
00:25:25,818 --> 00:25:29,196
You think I'm the only one
who's done anything wrong?

346
00:25:32,616 --> 00:25:33,617
Chairman.

347
00:25:39,081 --> 00:25:40,082
UHM SANGBAE

348
00:25:40,166 --> 00:25:44,128
Uhm, you traitor son of a bitch.
You're mocking me to the end.

349
00:26:03,481 --> 00:26:05,024
I envy her.

350
00:26:05,691 --> 00:26:06,692
What?

351
00:26:08,152 --> 00:26:09,820
I envy Jiu.

352
00:26:09,904 --> 00:26:12,239
Her parents are really close too.

353
00:26:13,073 --> 00:26:15,034
But you always fight with Dad.

354
00:26:15,534 --> 00:26:16,952
You're getting a divorce too.

355
00:26:17,036 --> 00:26:19,497
All my friends at kindergarten
know about it.

356
00:26:21,874 --> 00:26:25,461
Mom and Dad love you so much, Leo.

357
00:26:26,003 --> 00:26:28,005
That will never change.

358
00:26:28,088 --> 00:26:31,175
No, I want you to love Dad.

359
00:26:31,258 --> 00:26:34,053
I don't want you to get divorced! Geez.

360
00:26:35,513 --> 00:26:37,264
Leo! Jang Leo!

361
00:26:39,141 --> 00:26:41,018
I take pretty good pictures, right?

362
00:26:42,019 --> 00:26:44,522
Thank you
for taking such good pictures of me.

363
00:26:46,398 --> 00:26:47,650
Who's this?

364
00:26:48,234 --> 00:26:49,902
Uncle Pilseung, of course.

365
00:26:51,445 --> 00:26:52,947
Uncle Pilseung?

366
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:56,075
Mommy, you really were sick, huh?

367
00:26:56,158 --> 00:26:57,910
You even forgot Uncle Glued-to-me.

368
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:02,456
What're you two on about?

369
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:06,043
Mommy doesn't recognize
Uncle Pilseung, Daddy.

370
00:27:06,126 --> 00:27:09,338
Oh, he was your bodyguard,
and Jiu took a liking to him too.

371
00:27:09,922 --> 00:27:12,550
Jiu, I hear dessert is chocolate cake.

372
00:27:12,633 --> 00:27:14,176
Mommy, bye!

373
00:27:15,386 --> 00:27:16,804
Don't have too much of it.

374
00:27:21,767 --> 00:27:23,018
He was my bodyguard?

375
00:27:23,102 --> 00:27:24,728
You didn't really like him.

376
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:28,315
He was with us for a while,
but he quit shortly after.

377
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:29,483
Really?

378
00:27:30,067 --> 00:27:31,569
He's no one of importance.

379
00:27:33,487 --> 00:27:36,490
That aside, what did Kyojin tell you?

380
00:27:36,574 --> 00:27:39,368
Oh, that he was worried about me.

381
00:27:40,286 --> 00:27:42,788
Apparently we promised to meet,
but he couldn't reach me.

382
00:27:43,497 --> 00:27:46,083
We were never that close.
It was a bit strange.

383
00:27:47,042 --> 00:27:51,171
He was unconscious for seven years.
It must be tough for him to readjust.

384
00:27:51,255 --> 00:27:53,799
Just bear with him
when he makes odd remarks.

385
00:27:54,383 --> 00:27:56,760
But we won't be seeing him often anyway.

386
00:27:57,344 --> 00:27:59,138
I hope he gets better soon.

387
00:27:59,221 --> 00:28:01,891
If you're tired, you can go rest.
I'll wrap it up over here.

388
00:28:01,974 --> 00:28:03,684
Shall I? Thank you.

389
00:28:03,767 --> 00:28:05,853
Take your medication and get some sleep.

390
00:28:12,526 --> 00:28:13,986
<i>What should I do, Taera?</i>

391
00:28:14,653 --> 00:28:15,863
<i>I don't know what to do.</i>

392
00:28:16,697 --> 00:28:18,365
<i>How do I save you?</i>

393
00:28:30,085 --> 00:28:31,211
Dojin?

394
00:28:31,921 --> 00:28:33,547
Do you have something to say?

395
00:28:33,631 --> 00:28:37,176
Haesoo's very worried about you.
She hopes you'll regain your memory soon.

396
00:28:38,552 --> 00:28:42,389
Jaehyun is taking good care of me,
so tell her she needn't worry.

397
00:28:53,776 --> 00:28:58,489
Dr. Yang Sejin resigned? So suddenly?
She didn't say where she was going?

398
00:28:58,572 --> 00:29:01,700
We wouldn't know.
She resigned due to personal reasons.

399
00:29:31,563 --> 00:29:34,525
Ms. Eun, I need you
to find someone for me.

400
00:29:35,275 --> 00:29:36,694
Find Dr. Yang Sejin of Hatch.

401
00:29:46,829 --> 00:29:49,665
Jang Kyojin is looking
for Dr. Yang, Mr. Pyo.

402
00:29:50,374 --> 00:29:51,709
<i>He went to Hatch</i>

403
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,878
<i>and even to Dr. Yang's house.</i>

404
00:29:55,754 --> 00:29:57,673
I should've taken care of her sooner.

405
00:29:59,216 --> 00:30:01,969
Keep an eye on him
so that he doesn't cause any trouble.

406
00:30:03,262 --> 00:30:06,890
Did you check? Are you sure
she has a chip implanted in her?

407
00:30:08,142 --> 00:30:09,601
I checked with the reader.

408
00:30:12,312 --> 00:30:15,607
<i>Jaehyun wiped her memories.
I'm sure of it.</i>

409
00:30:16,191 --> 00:30:17,943
Is that even possible?

410
00:30:18,027 --> 00:30:21,030
My brother used to conduct
research on memory.

411
00:30:21,572 --> 00:30:24,074
He implanted a chip
in a traumatized patient's brain

412
00:30:24,158 --> 00:30:25,868
and erased a part of their memory.

413
00:30:25,951 --> 00:30:29,371
Well, we stopped the clinical trials
due to severe side effects.

414
00:30:30,289 --> 00:30:31,999
Was Jaehyun on the research team too?

415
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:36,295
Only Kyojin and Sujeong were involved
in that research.

416
00:30:37,546 --> 00:30:40,632
But how could Jaehyun erase
Taera's memories without Sujeong?

417
00:30:41,258 --> 00:30:43,552
He probably had help from Dr. Yang.

418
00:30:43,635 --> 00:30:46,305
I think Dr. Yang and Jaehyun
have a special relationship.

419
00:30:46,388 --> 00:30:49,183
It was Jaehyun
who brought Dr. Yang to Hatch.

420
00:30:49,266 --> 00:30:52,436
They're the ones who concocted
the narrative about Red's death as well.

421
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,563
Dojin.

422
00:30:56,398 --> 00:30:59,109
What if, by some extraordinary chance,
Dr. Yang is Sujeong?

423
00:30:59,818 --> 00:31:00,819
NATIONAL ID
YANG SEJIN

424
00:31:00,903 --> 00:31:03,530
Isn't that Dr. Yang Sejin?
Why does Jaehyun have this?

425
00:31:03,614 --> 00:31:05,491
Isn't it odd that these are hidden here?

426
00:31:06,492 --> 00:31:08,994
I found out Pyo Jaehyun
had hidden Dr. Yang's ID.

427
00:31:10,704 --> 00:31:13,123
What if Yang Sejin is a fake identity?

428
00:31:13,207 --> 00:31:16,085
If her face has been altered,
we wouldn't be able to recognize her.

429
00:31:16,794 --> 00:31:18,003
I doubt it.

430
00:31:18,921 --> 00:31:21,298
Jaehyun is more than capable
of doing such a thing.

431
00:31:28,514 --> 00:31:30,307
Anything new from my wife's phone?

432
00:31:31,016 --> 00:31:33,894
I'm constantly checking,
but there's nothing new.

433
00:31:35,312 --> 00:31:37,731
Don't let her out of your sight.

434
00:31:37,815 --> 00:31:39,441
Make sure no one comes near her.

435
00:31:40,109 --> 00:31:43,362
Especially keep her away
from Jang Dojin and Ko Haesoo.

436
00:31:43,445 --> 00:31:44,446
Got it?

437
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:45,572
Yes, Mr. Pyo.

438
00:32:27,322 --> 00:32:29,491
<i>No. 50, who assassinated
President Ko Taesun,</i>

439
00:32:29,575 --> 00:32:32,703
<i>is Pyo Jaehyun's wife, Hong Taera.</i>

440
00:32:43,505 --> 00:32:45,048
Mr. Uhm.

441
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:50,637
I guess you did have
a sliver of conscience left in you.

442
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:00,647
Will you really be okay with that?

443
00:33:00,731 --> 00:33:02,149
I really mean it.

444
00:33:02,232 --> 00:33:05,319
I'll support you right by your side
until the election.

445
00:33:05,402 --> 00:33:06,778
You want my support, no?

446
00:33:07,571 --> 00:33:09,072
So much so that I feel guilty.

447
00:33:11,074 --> 00:33:15,162
I sold off my Hatch shares,
and you've set up your blind trust.

448
00:33:15,245 --> 00:33:17,873
When I asked Mr. Oh about it,
he didn't know what I meant.

449
00:33:17,956 --> 00:33:19,583
Who did you entrust your shares to?

450
00:33:19,666 --> 00:33:21,585
I have a friend who's managing it.

451
00:33:21,668 --> 00:33:24,087
I couldn't tell you in advance
because you were ill.

452
00:33:24,171 --> 00:33:27,883
I took care of it,
so you don't need to worry.

453
00:33:28,926 --> 00:33:31,178
You must trust that person a lot.

454
00:33:31,929 --> 00:33:33,096
Who could it be?

455
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:35,724
There's someone who will never betray me.

456
00:33:38,101 --> 00:33:40,771
You're not upset because I didn't ask
for your consent, right?

457
00:33:41,772 --> 00:33:43,482
I'm sure you took care of it well.

458
00:33:44,733 --> 00:33:48,070
You're going to Haesoo's station
for the radio interview, right?

459
00:33:48,153 --> 00:33:49,321
Yes.

460
00:33:50,948 --> 00:33:53,325
I looked through
the materials you gave me.

461
00:33:53,825 --> 00:33:57,704
If the implanted chip has already
attached itself to a cranial nerve,

462
00:33:57,788 --> 00:33:59,039
it can't be removed.

463
00:33:59,706 --> 00:34:02,709
The chip was implanted recently,
so there must be hope.

464
00:34:03,627 --> 00:34:06,213
Please find a way
with all the data you have.

465
00:34:06,296 --> 00:34:07,756
You know the odds are slim.

466
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:09,800
There hasn't been a successful case yet.

467
00:34:09,883 --> 00:34:12,678
I've asked for cooperation
from neuroscientists abroad.

468
00:34:12,761 --> 00:34:15,764
She's very important to me.
You must save her, Professor.

469
00:34:20,602 --> 00:34:22,688
INCOMING CALL
MOTHER

470
00:34:22,771 --> 00:34:25,649
<i>This number is unavailable.
Please leave a message...</i>

471
00:34:29,027 --> 00:34:30,696
It's time, ma'am.

472
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:42,416
SHAREHOLDERS' MEETING

473
00:34:42,499 --> 00:34:44,376
With Hatch's successful presentation,

474
00:34:44,459 --> 00:34:46,586
Mr. Jang Dojin's
capabilities have been proven.

475
00:34:47,337 --> 00:34:50,048
Also, as he is experienced in this field,

476
00:34:50,132 --> 00:34:54,511
it's only right that
he takes over the neuroscience project.

477
00:34:54,594 --> 00:34:57,306
KUMJO GROUP

478
00:34:57,389 --> 00:35:02,019
Mr. Jang Dojin
sold Kumjo Pharmaceuticals for a song,

479
00:35:02,102 --> 00:35:05,022
which also means that
he lacks business insight.

480
00:35:05,105 --> 00:35:08,233
If he thought about
the future value of neuroscience,

481
00:35:08,317 --> 00:35:10,694
he would've never merged
the two companies.

482
00:35:11,903 --> 00:35:16,241
Kyojin would've never made such a choice.

483
00:35:20,329 --> 00:35:22,914
He was bedridden for seven years.

484
00:35:22,998 --> 00:35:24,499
Business insight?

485
00:35:24,583 --> 00:35:27,544
He probably doesn't even know
what's going on in our company.

486
00:35:36,428 --> 00:35:38,055
Sir!

487
00:35:38,138 --> 00:35:39,431
Chairman.

488
00:35:39,514 --> 00:35:41,558
- How...
- Oh, no.

489
00:35:45,771 --> 00:35:46,938
Sit down.

490
00:35:56,323 --> 00:36:00,285
I'm sure some of you are glad
that I came back alive.

491
00:36:01,286 --> 00:36:04,373
And some of you
probably wished that I was dead.

492
00:36:05,207 --> 00:36:08,710
And someone even acted on that wish.

493
00:36:11,004 --> 00:36:14,257
But that's what gave me the strength
to stand here again,

494
00:36:14,341 --> 00:36:16,968
so perhaps I should be thanking them.

495
00:36:28,605 --> 00:36:30,357
What's happening?

496
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,691
That's a crime.

497
00:36:31,775 --> 00:36:33,485
I can't believe it.

498
00:36:39,324 --> 00:36:41,034
Mother, is this all true?

499
00:36:41,952 --> 00:36:45,580
If this actually happened,
then the stock waiver is invalid.

500
00:36:45,664 --> 00:36:47,582
That's... That's...

501
00:36:47,666 --> 00:36:51,044
This is all my fault,
so there's no one else to blame.

502
00:36:52,712 --> 00:36:56,007
There won't be any more dirty fights
for money at Kumjo.

503
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:59,010
It's just too embarrassing

504
00:36:59,094 --> 00:37:01,972
to see us fight amongst family.

505
00:37:04,307 --> 00:37:05,976
I, Jang Kummo,

506
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:09,688
will return as the chairman
and bring peace and order to the family.

507
00:37:09,771 --> 00:37:12,190
So there is need to worry. Understood?

508
00:37:12,274 --> 00:37:13,400
Yes, sir.

509
00:37:14,776 --> 00:37:16,236
Give me a chance to explain.

510
00:37:16,319 --> 00:37:19,114
And CEO Jang Dojin, you'll be
the vice chairman starting today.

511
00:37:21,741 --> 00:37:24,035
He will work by my side,
so I can teach him.

512
00:37:24,995 --> 00:37:27,205
So make sure you treat him well.

513
00:37:27,289 --> 00:37:28,790
Yes, sir!

514
00:37:50,812 --> 00:37:53,607
Reporter Jung.
Go to the KDP campaign office right now.

515
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:56,485
Mr. Park, you and I
will cover Candidate Pyo's campaign.

516
00:37:56,568 --> 00:37:59,154
Mr. Pyo's next schedule
is a live radio show, so...

517
00:37:59,237 --> 00:38:00,989
I'll cover Pyo, Mr. Song.

518
00:38:02,908 --> 00:38:05,076
I'll report on Candidate Pyo Jaehyun.

519
00:38:11,625 --> 00:38:13,043
But why?

520
00:38:13,585 --> 00:38:16,338
I'm sincerely grateful to everyone

521
00:38:16,421 --> 00:38:19,216
who's shown support
for my husband, Candidate Pyo.

522
00:38:19,299 --> 00:38:22,177
He's always been a great husband
and an amazing father.

523
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:25,305
That is why I support and trust him
in this decision.

524
00:38:25,847 --> 00:38:28,558
I'll do my best until the end. Thank you.

525
00:38:33,855 --> 00:38:35,398
<i>I'm Ko Haesoo from YBC.</i>

526
00:38:35,482 --> 00:38:37,025
I'm currently at the station

527
00:38:37,108 --> 00:38:40,403
where candidate No. 7, Pyo's live
radio interview is taking place.

528
00:38:40,487 --> 00:38:42,531
The presidential election is
in three days.

529
00:38:42,614 --> 00:38:46,076
The candidate's wife, Hong Taera,
is actively campaigning with him,

530
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:48,662
drawing many people's attention.

531
00:38:48,745 --> 00:38:53,083
Pyo Jaehyun! Pyo Jaehyun! Pyo Jaehyun!

532
00:38:53,166 --> 00:38:56,169
Pyo Jaehyun! Pyo Jaehyun!

533
00:38:56,253 --> 00:38:58,797
Ms. Hong. May I interview you?

534
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,550
You can't do this
without an appointment, Ms. Ko.

535
00:39:01,633 --> 00:39:04,511
I'm sorry, but we have to run
to our next appointment.

536
00:39:05,887 --> 00:39:08,557
This is the question your supporters
want to know the most.

537
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,225
Please spare us some time.

538
00:39:11,268 --> 00:39:14,229
Will you really refuse?
It'll only take a minute.

539
00:39:32,664 --> 00:39:35,166
Let's begin, Ms. Ko. What's the question?

540
00:39:42,716 --> 00:39:44,050
Read the questionnaire first.

541
00:39:47,929 --> 00:39:49,639
<i>Taera, you know who this is, don't you?</i>

542
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:53,184
<i>Who on earth is she?</i>

543
00:39:53,268 --> 00:39:55,979
<i>The real killer
of the late President Ko Taesun.</i>

544
00:39:56,062 --> 00:39:58,189
<i>This is the assassin who killed my father.</i>

545
00:39:58,982 --> 00:40:00,567
<i>The woman in this photo.</i>

546
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:03,194
<i>The suspect who assassinated
the former President Ko.</i>

547
00:40:03,278 --> 00:40:05,155
<i>Is this you, Ms. Hong?</i>

548
00:40:07,991 --> 00:40:09,075
What is this?

549
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:10,952
Your memory that Jaehyun erased.

550
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,538
What on earth
are you talking about, Haesoo?

551
00:40:13,622 --> 00:40:16,333
Jaehyun implanted a chip in you
to erase your memory

552
00:40:16,416 --> 00:40:18,585
because you found out the truth about him.

553
00:40:18,668 --> 00:40:20,211
He's the one who killed Yura.

554
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,922
You saw him on the night
of the thunderstorm.

555
00:40:23,006 --> 00:40:24,716
He staged Yura's death as a suicide.

556
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:28,428
Stop helping Jaehyun.
How much more do you want to regret?

557
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:30,180
Stop it, Haesoo.

558
00:40:30,764 --> 00:40:32,057
I'm quite happy right now.

559
00:40:32,641 --> 00:40:34,643
I'm warning you.
Don't cross the line again.

560
00:40:34,726 --> 00:40:39,356
If you talk that way about Jaehyun
one more time, we will never speak again.

561
00:40:39,439 --> 00:40:40,607
Taera.

562
00:40:41,358 --> 00:40:44,235
You have to believe me.
Stay away from Jaehyun.

563
00:40:44,944 --> 00:40:46,738
There's no time!

564
00:40:46,821 --> 00:40:48,740
I can't watch you become miserable.

565
00:40:52,577 --> 00:40:56,498
No, Taera. Jaehyun gave that to you?
Don't take the pill.

566
00:40:56,581 --> 00:40:58,333
Don't do anything he tells you to do!

567
00:40:58,917 --> 00:41:01,711
Taera! Please believe me!

568
00:41:02,379 --> 00:41:03,630
Are you okay, honey?

569
00:41:05,465 --> 00:41:06,508
Let's go.

570
00:41:07,425 --> 00:41:09,469
Taera, hold on!

571
00:41:09,552 --> 00:41:11,012
Taera!

572
00:41:17,894 --> 00:41:19,562
Where were you?

573
00:41:22,941 --> 00:41:25,944
Didn't you know how important
today's shareholders' meeting was?

574
00:41:26,653 --> 00:41:29,114
Kummo became the chairman again.

575
00:41:29,823 --> 00:41:32,742
Kumjo Group is in their hands!

576
00:41:32,826 --> 00:41:34,160
I'm sorry.

577
00:41:34,244 --> 00:41:35,745
I had something important to do.

578
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:37,956
What is more important than Kumjo?

579
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:40,583
It's about Taera's chip removal surgery.

580
00:41:40,667 --> 00:41:42,043
I found a doctor.

581
00:41:42,127 --> 00:41:44,796
This isn't the time to cling on
to something so lousy!

582
00:41:45,714 --> 00:41:47,048
Mother.

583
00:41:47,924 --> 00:41:50,343
I'm not interested in taking over Kumjo.

584
00:41:50,427 --> 00:41:52,178
What are you talking about?

585
00:41:52,262 --> 00:41:56,099
I had bad blood with Dojin
because he refused to admit his fault.

586
00:41:56,182 --> 00:41:58,143
It's not because I wanted to lead Kumjo.

587
00:41:58,226 --> 00:42:01,229
I don't want to risk my life
to take over that blood-stained Kumjo.

588
00:42:01,312 --> 00:42:03,565
How could you be so irresponsible?

589
00:42:03,648 --> 00:42:07,152
Do you know what I sacrificed
to make sure you inherit Kumjo?

590
00:42:07,235 --> 00:42:09,696
Who do you think I protected Kumjo for?

591
00:42:10,321 --> 00:42:12,323
Don't you get it?

592
00:42:12,407 --> 00:42:14,617
You're just like Father.

593
00:42:14,701 --> 00:42:17,036
Or maybe even worse.

594
00:42:18,455 --> 00:42:19,456
What?

595
00:42:19,539 --> 00:42:21,750
Do you think I don't know?

596
00:42:21,833 --> 00:42:24,711
Father bought me a bike
on my 13th birthday.

597
00:42:24,794 --> 00:42:26,755
You broke it on purpose.

598
00:42:26,838 --> 00:42:28,631
You hated Dojin for riding my bike,

599
00:42:28,715 --> 00:42:30,592
so you wanted Father
to hate Dojin as well.

600
00:42:31,634 --> 00:42:33,595
If you really care about me,

601
00:42:33,678 --> 00:42:36,222
you should let go
of your ambition for Kumjo.

602
00:42:36,306 --> 00:42:39,434
Stop hiding behind Buddha
and smiling like a saint.

603
00:42:39,517 --> 00:42:41,686
Let go of your ambitions first!

604
00:42:44,814 --> 00:42:46,399
None of us

605
00:42:47,442 --> 00:42:49,861
deserve to have Kumjo.

606
00:42:50,779 --> 00:42:52,363
Hong Taera!

607
00:42:53,072 --> 00:42:54,574
Is it because of that wench?

608
00:42:57,118 --> 00:43:01,372
She doesn't even remember you anymore.
Why are you doing this for her?

609
00:43:04,167 --> 00:43:05,168
Don't tell me…

610
00:43:07,337 --> 00:43:09,547
you have feelings for Hong Taera.

611
00:43:09,631 --> 00:43:11,883
What are you talking about?

612
00:43:11,966 --> 00:43:15,011
I pity her. I have to help her somehow!

613
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:17,722
Don't get the wrong idea.

614
00:43:26,147 --> 00:43:29,150
How... How could you do this to me?

615
00:43:29,234 --> 00:43:32,111
How... How could you?

616
00:43:36,491 --> 00:43:39,118
30 YEARS AGO

617
00:43:55,802 --> 00:43:58,221
<i>How dare you ride my son's bike first?</i>

618
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:00,348
<i>You little bastard.</i>

619
00:44:14,237 --> 00:44:15,738
Kyojin.

620
00:44:17,657 --> 00:44:20,326
You only deserve perfection.

621
00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:25,248
I will make sure that happens.

622
00:44:35,383 --> 00:44:38,845
Ultimately, Kumjo Group will be yours.

623
00:44:38,928 --> 00:44:42,765
Do you think your father
will give it to Kyojin? Huh?

624
00:44:42,849 --> 00:44:45,351
But what's with the long face?

625
00:44:45,435 --> 00:44:47,520
You look like you ate shit. Huh?

626
00:44:47,604 --> 00:44:49,105
You're such a buzzkill.

627
00:44:50,315 --> 00:44:52,442
Besides, if I were you,

628
00:44:52,525 --> 00:44:54,861
I would've gotten divorced already

629
00:44:54,944 --> 00:44:58,406
and gotten married three more times.

630
00:44:58,489 --> 00:44:59,949
This is between us, but frankly...

631
00:45:00,033 --> 00:45:01,242
This is just between us.

632
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:04,078
What's so great about Haesoo?

633
00:45:04,162 --> 00:45:05,955
She's mean as hell.

634
00:45:06,539 --> 00:45:08,458
Daughter of the president, my foot.

635
00:45:08,958 --> 00:45:10,877
That was ages ago.

636
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,211
You punk.

637
00:45:12,295 --> 00:45:14,714
If I think about it,
you're such a pushover.

638
00:45:14,797 --> 00:45:16,299
Shit.

639
00:45:19,802 --> 00:45:20,845
Watch your mouth.

640
00:45:21,596 --> 00:45:26,559
That woman doesn't deserve mockery
from your filthy mouth.

641
00:45:26,643 --> 00:45:30,438
And she doesn't deserve to be miserable
because of a moron like me.

642
00:45:39,906 --> 00:45:41,658
He must be out of his mind.

643
00:45:44,118 --> 00:45:46,496
Does he want to face death
like his brother?

644
00:45:53,878 --> 00:45:55,964
You worked so hard today.

645
00:45:56,631 --> 00:45:58,549
You're the one who worked hard today.

646
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:03,262
You have to become the president
so that our efforts aren't in vain, okay?

647
00:46:03,346 --> 00:46:04,597
Okay.

648
00:46:06,975 --> 00:46:08,434
You need to take your medicine.

649
00:46:08,518 --> 00:46:09,644
Right.

650
00:46:20,405 --> 00:46:22,573

SAMPLE 2 MISSING

651
00:46:24,993 --> 00:46:26,119
Oh, man.

652
00:46:26,202 --> 00:46:28,246
Something came up at the camp.
I have to go.

653
00:46:28,329 --> 00:46:30,289
Don't wait up for me, okay?

654
00:47:01,738 --> 00:47:03,906
<i>Even if it's just for a while,</i>

655
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:05,908
<i>I want to be happy with Taera,</i>

656
00:47:05,992 --> 00:47:07,076
<i>like we were before.</i>

657
00:47:08,703 --> 00:47:11,205
<i>Let's erase Taera's memory.</i>

658
00:47:20,631 --> 00:47:22,717
Your real name is Park Sujeong.

659
00:47:23,509 --> 00:47:26,471
You were tricked by Jaehyun
just like I was.

660
00:47:26,554 --> 00:47:28,431
You have to stop him.

661
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:30,349
Please help me.

662
00:47:32,852 --> 00:47:34,145
Park Sujeong?

663
00:48:02,381 --> 00:48:03,674
We're connected. Begin.

664
00:48:06,344 --> 00:48:09,514
DELETE MEMORIES?
YES, NO

665
00:48:30,284 --> 00:48:31,953
Dr. Yang?

666
00:48:34,288 --> 00:48:35,957
DELETE MEMORIES?
YES, NO

667
00:48:44,882 --> 00:48:45,925
Wait, what just happened?

668
00:48:47,009 --> 00:48:48,553
Pyo Jaehyun.

669
00:48:48,636 --> 00:48:50,555
Are you planning to make Taera like me?

670
00:48:52,557 --> 00:48:54,142
I'm going to tell Kyojin everything.

671
00:48:54,225 --> 00:48:57,186
I'm going to tell him
all about what you've done!

672
00:48:58,896 --> 00:49:00,189
So you finally remembered?

673
00:49:04,235 --> 00:49:06,195
- Take her to room two.
- Yes, sir.

674
00:49:06,904 --> 00:49:08,364
Leave Taera alone!

675
00:49:08,447 --> 00:49:10,408
Leave her alone!

676
00:49:20,835 --> 00:49:22,295
DELETING MEMORIES

677
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:25,423
No.

678
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:45,193
Taera.

679
00:49:47,653 --> 00:49:48,821
Let's go back home.

680
00:49:57,163 --> 00:49:59,498
Check her vitals
and get ready to move her.

681
00:49:59,582 --> 00:50:00,625
Yes, sir.

682
00:50:08,966 --> 00:50:10,051
Where's No. 105?

683
00:50:10,718 --> 00:50:12,803
We have a healthy sample for a change.

684
00:50:13,596 --> 00:50:14,597
Take him to room six.

685
00:50:19,310 --> 00:50:20,519
<i>Room six?</i>

686
00:50:23,272 --> 00:50:24,774
<i>I need to find his secret lab.</i>

687
00:50:25,441 --> 00:50:26,984
<i>Dr. Yang and Hajun are there.</i>

688
00:50:34,909 --> 00:50:36,786
<i>Have you not been keeping watch?</i>

689
00:50:37,286 --> 00:50:40,331
Check the security footage
and find her escape route.

690
00:50:40,414 --> 00:50:43,668
Get her back before someone finds out.
Got it?

691
00:52:17,845 --> 00:52:22,600
PAWNSHOP

692
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,097
Are you becoming senile?

693
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:05,684
I guess you are really busy.
You're hearing this news so late.

694
00:53:05,768 --> 00:53:07,895
Returning as the chairman?

695
00:53:07,978 --> 00:53:10,147
Did you forget about the cards
I have against you?

696
00:53:10,231 --> 00:53:13,818
Perhaps I have been a decent man,
but I received a gift.

697
00:53:14,735 --> 00:53:16,445
Your wife is something else.

698
00:53:19,365 --> 00:53:21,909
<i>No. 50, who assassinated
President Ko Taesun,</i>

699
00:53:21,992 --> 00:53:24,787
<i>is Pyo Jaehyun's wife, Hong Taera.</i>

700
00:53:27,498 --> 00:53:30,376
Pyo Jaehyun, you're really something.

701
00:53:31,836 --> 00:53:34,422
What prompted you
to make an assassin your wife?

702
00:53:34,505 --> 00:53:39,635
Oh, my, how terrifying.

703
00:53:39,718 --> 00:53:41,846
I could never do it.

704
00:53:42,847 --> 00:53:44,849
I concede defeat, you punk.

705
00:53:51,897 --> 00:53:54,358
Did you think Mr. Uhm was your man?

706
00:53:55,443 --> 00:53:57,653
Don't fool yourself.

707
00:53:57,736 --> 00:54:00,531
Do you know how hard it is
to win someone's heart?

708
00:54:01,115 --> 00:54:03,993
You really think you have
what it takes be president?

709
00:54:04,743 --> 00:54:06,370
Thanks to Mr. Uhm,

710
00:54:07,037 --> 00:54:09,623
I got my position back.

711
00:54:10,541 --> 00:54:13,878
I found him a nice burial ground.

712
00:54:18,048 --> 00:54:20,759
Don't ever lay your hands on Kumjo again.

713
00:54:21,677 --> 00:54:24,430
You and I are in the same boat.

714
00:54:25,181 --> 00:54:28,851
Whether we're floating or sinking,

715
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:32,104
we're in this together.

716
00:54:36,192 --> 00:54:37,359
You understand?

717
00:54:51,332 --> 00:54:53,000
Mr. Jang Dojin.

718
00:54:53,083 --> 00:54:54,877
I think Haesoo is up to something.

719
00:54:55,878 --> 00:54:57,129
What do you mean?

720
00:54:57,213 --> 00:54:58,589
She submitted her resignation.

721
00:54:58,672 --> 00:55:00,090
Resignation?

722
00:55:08,057 --> 00:55:09,683
Hello? Haesoo.

723
00:55:09,767 --> 00:55:12,186
- <i>Hey.
</i>-Where are you?

724
00:55:12,269 --> 00:55:14,021
Let's meet. I'll go to you.

725
00:55:16,899 --> 00:55:18,609
I have nothing to say.

726
00:55:18,692 --> 00:55:21,278
<i>Wait. We should meet.</i>

727
00:55:21,362 --> 00:55:24,365
<i>Let's talk in person.
Where are you right now?</i>

728
00:55:25,824 --> 00:55:27,409
I've given it some thought,

729
00:55:27,910 --> 00:55:29,620
and I realized I've been cowardly.

730
00:55:30,996 --> 00:55:32,915
What right did I have to criticize you

731
00:55:33,666 --> 00:55:35,876
when I couldn't even sacrifice
my own life?

732
00:55:39,547 --> 00:55:41,090
I can't forgive myself

733
00:55:42,341 --> 00:55:44,468
for being incapable of hurting your father

734
00:55:45,177 --> 00:55:48,847
only because I felt sorry for you
and I didn't want to see you fall apart.

735
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:52,643
My parents…

736
00:55:54,979 --> 00:55:56,647
must be very disappointed in me.

737
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:02,611
You're not thinking
of doing anything weird, are you?

738
00:56:07,449 --> 00:56:08,617
I'm going to end it.

739
00:56:10,578 --> 00:56:11,745
Take good care of Leo.

740
00:56:13,289 --> 00:56:14,623
That's all I ask of you.

741
00:56:15,291 --> 00:56:17,084
<i>What are you trying to end?</i>

742
00:56:17,626 --> 00:56:19,211
No, don't do anything.

743
00:56:19,295 --> 00:56:20,796
Wait until I get there, okay?

744
00:56:20,879 --> 00:56:23,007
Do you understand, Haesoo? He... Hello?

745
00:56:26,594 --> 00:56:29,597
<i>This number is unavailable.
Please leave a message after the tone.</i>

746
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:30,723
Shit.

747
00:56:31,557 --> 00:56:34,018
You don't have to push yourself too hard.

748
00:56:34,101 --> 00:56:36,353
You said they'll be
on your transition team.

749
00:56:36,437 --> 00:56:38,355
I can't miss such an important meeting.

750
00:56:39,106 --> 00:56:41,358
How should I repay you for all this work?

751
00:56:41,442 --> 00:56:44,570
President Pyo Jaehyun.
That title is all I need.

752
00:56:46,989 --> 00:56:49,283
I promise I'll make you the first lady.

753
00:56:52,077 --> 00:56:53,412
Oh, right.

754
00:56:53,495 --> 00:56:56,874
I packed a bottle of wine as a gift.
Hold on.

755
00:56:58,500 --> 00:56:59,585
Take your time.

756
00:57:19,146 --> 00:57:20,981
You still haven't found her?

757
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:24,860
Dr. Yang, that bitch.
Where the hell is she hiding?

758
00:58:03,565 --> 00:58:04,858
Die, Pyo Jaehyun.

759
00:58:05,859 --> 00:58:07,152
- No!
- Oh!

760
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:48,861
Taera?

761
00:58:50,404 --> 00:58:51,405
No.

762
00:58:51,989 --> 00:58:53,073
Taera!

763
00:58:54,908 --> 00:58:59,204
No! Taera! No, Taera! Taera!

764
00:59:25,606 --> 00:59:30,027
<i>I'll show you what happens,
if you take Taera away from me.</i>

765
00:59:30,110 --> 00:59:33,155
Thought I followed Dr. Yang here,
but it's Sujeong.

766
00:59:33,238 --> 00:59:36,366
Watch your mouth,
unless you want to die here.

767
00:59:36,450 --> 00:59:39,411
<i>You're under arrest
for embezzlement and breach of trust.</i>

768
00:59:39,495 --> 00:59:41,455
<i>I found Jaehyun's co-conspirator.</i>

769
00:59:41,538 --> 00:59:44,500
<i>I'm staking my life
to bring Kumjo down from this day forward.</i>

770
00:59:44,583 --> 00:59:47,377
I'm in a bad mood today.
Do your best to hang in there.

771
00:59:47,461 --> 00:59:49,463
You're going to blow this place up?

772
00:59:49,546 --> 00:59:51,507
<i>Along with Jang Kyojin…</i>

773
00:59:51,590 --> 00:59:53,008
<i>Forever.</i>
