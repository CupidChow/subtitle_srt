EPISODE 12

3
00:00:24,516 --> 00:00:26,059
You're home alive, Taera.

4
00:00:26,602 --> 00:00:27,936
Don't let your guard down.

5
00:00:28,604 --> 00:00:30,981
Pyo Jaehyun saved you to kill you.

6
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:32,858
I know.

7
00:00:32,941 --> 00:00:35,819
He'll soon regret getting rid
of Mr. Uhm by his own hands.

8
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:46,705
I can't believe such a day
would come to Jang Kummo,

9
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:49,499
who once ruled the world.

10
00:00:54,922 --> 00:00:56,548
It's all…

11
00:00:56,632 --> 00:00:59,218
thanks to you, Pyo Jaehyun. Is it not?

12
00:01:02,721 --> 00:01:05,766
I'm only saying this because
you may have heard Uhm is dead.

13
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,977
Don't bother getting your hopes up.

14
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:13,565
Remember that I have all the evidence…

15
00:01:15,984 --> 00:01:17,027
you killed Ko Taesun.

16
00:01:18,654 --> 00:01:20,155
Your life…

17
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:22,366
is in my hands.

18
00:01:23,242 --> 00:01:24,243
You understand?

19
00:01:37,172 --> 00:01:40,300
The chairman's not feeling well.
You should take him inside.

20
00:01:44,596 --> 00:01:46,139
Shall we also go in?

21
00:01:47,182 --> 00:01:48,392
We have much to discuss.

22
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:01,697
What are you doing?

23
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:04,116
You will pay for the huge mess you made.

24
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,828
You're not taking
a step outside this house.

25
00:02:07,911 --> 00:02:09,413
Security will watch you 24-7,

26
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:12,207
and you're prohibited from meeting
or contacting anyone.

27
00:02:13,917 --> 00:02:16,336
How many more people are you going to kill

28
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:18,213
to become president?

29
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:25,178
I killed Mr. Uhm for you.

30
00:02:26,013 --> 00:02:28,390
It was the only way to get you out.

31
00:02:28,473 --> 00:02:29,725
For me?

32
00:02:32,811 --> 00:02:34,521
You expect me to be grateful?

33
00:02:34,604 --> 00:02:35,981
Get clever on me again,

34
00:02:37,858 --> 00:02:39,568
and you'll find out who dies next.

35
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,446
Perhaps Ko Haesoo?

36
00:02:43,113 --> 00:02:44,114
Or…

37
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,783
your brother, No. 105?

38
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:57,044
All you have to do is to keep silent
and stay by my side.

39
00:02:58,628 --> 00:03:00,714
Let's go back to how we used to be, okay?

40
00:03:00,797 --> 00:03:03,091
What is your obsession with me?

41
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:05,844
It's over between us.

42
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:10,057
You will forever be my wife

43
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:12,225
and Jiu's mom.

44
00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:16,980
Do you have any idea what I've done
to create this perfect family?

45
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:19,900
Eventually, you and Jiu

46
00:03:19,983 --> 00:03:23,320
will stand beside me,
holding my hands at the inauguration.

47
00:03:23,987 --> 00:03:24,988
Got that?

48
00:03:33,663 --> 00:03:34,664
Jiu…

49
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,084
Does he know?

50
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:54,601
<i>Hagyeong.</i>

51
00:03:55,477 --> 00:03:57,104
Hajun, is everything all right?

52
00:03:57,187 --> 00:03:58,438
Yeah, what's going on?

53
00:03:58,522 --> 00:04:01,775
<i>Jaehyun is looking for you.
Take Jiu and get out of there.</i>

54
00:04:01,858 --> 00:04:04,569
Don't take any calls
unless it's from this number.

55
00:04:04,653 --> 00:04:06,655
You cannot get caught. Understand?

56
00:04:10,409 --> 00:04:11,493
Why is Jiu crying?

57
00:04:11,576 --> 00:04:13,370
She keeps asking for her dad.

58
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:16,039
I want to call my daddy.

59
00:04:16,123 --> 00:04:18,500
I miss my daddy!

60
00:04:19,042 --> 00:04:21,211
What if he's looking for me?

61
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,132
I want to call him.

62
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,925
Put Jiu on the phone.

63
00:04:27,008 --> 00:04:30,429
Jiu, your mom wants to talk to you.

64
00:04:30,512 --> 00:04:32,806
No! I hate Mommy!

65
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:34,891
Why did she send me here alone?

66
00:04:35,684 --> 00:04:37,519
I'm going to go home!

67
00:04:37,602 --> 00:04:39,813
Jiu! Hold on.

68
00:04:39,896 --> 00:04:42,149
Hello? Jiu?

69
00:04:42,232 --> 00:04:44,359
She's too young to accept
what's happening.

70
00:04:44,443 --> 00:04:45,444
Let me talk to her.

71
00:04:48,905 --> 00:04:50,991
I think I'm being too harsh on Jiu.

72
00:04:52,451 --> 00:04:54,870
I'm afraid she'll think I abandoned her.

73
00:04:54,953 --> 00:04:57,414
Hagyeong, just get here safely.

74
00:04:58,415 --> 00:05:00,250
It's what's best for Jiu.

75
00:05:02,752 --> 00:05:04,004
I won't take too long.

76
00:05:07,966 --> 00:05:08,967
<i>You may go.</i>

77
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,188
Father, it's been a while since we talked.

78
00:05:30,238 --> 00:05:33,992
Ever since I was little, I'd follow
my dad around, so I saw you often.

79
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,954
We used to go fishing together,
and you'd join our dinners.

80
00:05:39,247 --> 00:05:42,542
We even spent Christmas
and holidays together.

81
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,880
Back then, I thought you cared for me.

82
00:05:48,215 --> 00:05:50,842
But then again, I'm sure…

83
00:05:51,426 --> 00:05:54,179
you had no intention of killing
my father in those days.

84
00:06:01,102 --> 00:06:02,103
Isn't that right?

85
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:04,439
Is this why you brought me here?

86
00:06:06,775 --> 00:06:08,818
To bleed me dry and watch me die?

87
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:12,781
Aren't you going to kill me anyway?

88
00:06:12,864 --> 00:06:16,117
Stop stalling, and just kill me! Do it!

89
00:06:20,497 --> 00:06:22,832
I thought you'd apologize
at the very least,

90
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:25,293
but you're grilling me,
as if I'm a criminal?

91
00:06:25,377 --> 00:06:27,379
Do you feel no remorse toward my father?

92
00:06:27,462 --> 00:06:31,508
How can you do such a heinous thing to
someone who trusted and cared about you?

93
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:33,260
That's enough!

94
00:06:33,343 --> 00:06:35,720
I'll pay for my own sins
when I go to hell!

95
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:38,390
Father!

96
00:06:38,473 --> 00:06:40,517
What took you so long, huh?

97
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,143
Let's... let's go home now.

98
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:44,271
Don't touch me!

99
00:06:44,813 --> 00:06:46,147
You can't reason with her.

100
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:49,568
What are you doing just standing there?
Go get my stuff!

101
00:06:49,651 --> 00:06:52,028
If you're here to take your father,
forget it.

102
00:06:52,112 --> 00:06:54,614
I decide whether he dies
by starvation or by torture.

103
00:06:56,908 --> 00:06:58,618
We should finalize the divorce.

104
00:06:59,703 --> 00:07:02,163
Or did you come back here
to get back with me?

105
00:07:06,209 --> 00:07:08,169
PETITION

106
00:07:09,671 --> 00:07:11,506
I didn't want to complicate the case,

107
00:07:12,215 --> 00:07:14,217
but it seems we can't reach an agreement.

108
00:07:17,262 --> 00:07:19,180
You'll need a good lawyer.

109
00:07:20,557 --> 00:07:25,645
I have no intention of losing my money,
the house, or even Leo to you.

110
00:07:42,621 --> 00:07:45,081
You made the right choice
to divorce her.

111
00:07:45,707 --> 00:07:47,709
You're finally getting your act together.

112
00:07:47,792 --> 00:07:50,003
I didn't do it to please you.

113
00:07:54,966 --> 00:07:56,885
<i>Come to the house. Let's talk.</i>

114
00:08:01,222 --> 00:08:02,265
Wait.

115
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:03,475
Why are you leaving me?

116
00:08:04,392 --> 00:08:05,435
Take me with you.

117
00:08:11,316 --> 00:08:14,611
You should stick around.
Looks like Haesoo's just getting started.

118
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:16,488
Even Buddha said,

119
00:08:16,571 --> 00:08:19,074
sin returns to the sinner.

120
00:08:19,741 --> 00:08:21,034
What... what are you saying?

121
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:22,535
Come back!

122
00:08:25,246 --> 00:08:27,123
Come back here!

123
00:08:30,502 --> 00:08:31,753
Come back!

124
00:08:50,689 --> 00:08:51,690
Been a long time.

125
00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:55,235
I wanted to meet when Mother wasn't here.

126
00:08:57,821 --> 00:08:59,572
I'm so grateful, I just might cry.

127
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:01,866
What is it you need to say?

128
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:04,994
Are you not glad to see me?

129
00:09:06,454 --> 00:09:07,872
Just get to the point.

130
00:09:10,667 --> 00:09:12,127
I need to hear it from you.

131
00:09:13,795 --> 00:09:16,548
Why'd you scrap your red sports car
seven years ago?

132
00:09:17,674 --> 00:09:20,510
You loved that new car
because it was a gift from Father.

133
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:27,434
That's what you want to ask your brother
after seven years?

134
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:31,229
That's why you brought me here?

135
00:09:32,021 --> 00:09:33,189
It's important.

136
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:35,942
Well…

137
00:09:36,818 --> 00:09:37,986
I got sick of it.

138
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:41,906
You know me.
I never stick to anything for too long.

139
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:45,034
I'm asking for the truth.

140
00:09:46,703 --> 00:09:50,165
You scrapped it
because of Sujeong's incident, didn't you?

141
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,463
The day before my accident,
I know you three were at the lab.

142
00:09:56,546 --> 00:09:57,714
And so was Sujeong.

143
00:09:58,757 --> 00:10:00,383
What happened that day?

144
00:10:03,219 --> 00:10:06,514
What the hell are Jaehyun,
Sungchan, and you trying to hide?

145
00:10:07,265 --> 00:10:09,100
We're not hiding anything.

146
00:10:09,726 --> 00:10:12,145
We never met Sujeong
because she had to be elsewhere.

147
00:10:12,228 --> 00:10:13,438
We never got to the lab.

148
00:10:14,189 --> 00:10:16,608
We drank at Jaehyun's and fell asleep.

149
00:10:16,691 --> 00:10:19,194
I heard you talk to Jaehyun that night.
So you know.

150
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,364
You remember that night seven years ago
very clearly,

151
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:26,493
as if you were waiting for me to ask.

152
00:10:29,287 --> 00:10:30,872
I'm going to ask one last time.

153
00:10:32,248 --> 00:10:34,751
You really have nothing to do
with her disappearance?

154
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:38,421
If you tell me the truth,
I don't care what you did.

155
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:40,298
I'll cover for you, no matter what.

156
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,801
So just tell me.

157
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:47,847
What?

158
00:10:49,265 --> 00:10:50,975
You think I killed her?

159
00:10:51,518 --> 00:10:54,521
You want to make it a reason
to take Kumjo from me?

160
00:10:58,817 --> 00:11:01,194
Maybe Mother was right, after all.

161
00:11:02,904 --> 00:11:04,447
You're not my brother anymore.

162
00:11:07,575 --> 00:11:09,369
Have I ever been a brother to you?

163
00:11:11,246 --> 00:11:12,664
Just be honest.

164
00:11:12,747 --> 00:11:15,834
Why don't you just say you hate me,
like Mother?

165
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,839
You think I don't know that you're just
pretending to be a good brother,

166
00:11:20,922 --> 00:11:24,008
but all the while, you're manipulating
Mother to steal Kumjo...

167
00:11:24,092 --> 00:11:26,010
Watch your mouth, you bastard!

168
00:11:28,972 --> 00:11:32,392
Right. Everyone expects me
to be the bastard.

169
00:11:33,768 --> 00:11:34,769
Right.

170
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:39,023
You want to make me out to be the bastard
who isn't thankful for what he has?

171
00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:40,650
Okay.

172
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:43,278
All right. I'll become that bastard then.

173
00:11:55,498 --> 00:11:58,334
<i>May we see the clothes
you wore to the event?</i>

174
00:11:59,669 --> 00:12:03,256
<i>- May we look for it ourselves?
</i>-This is the footage from the police.

175
00:12:04,048 --> 00:12:05,633
This was tough to get, Mr. Pyo.

176
00:12:06,509 --> 00:12:07,510
Great work.

177
00:12:08,177 --> 00:12:09,846
Make sure this never comes up.

178
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:13,516
Is Uhm's death going to catch up to us?

179
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,602
People are curious about his sudden death.

180
00:12:17,562 --> 00:12:19,439
It won't show up, even in an autopsy.

181
00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:23,067
It's a poisonous needle
developed by Hanwool.

182
00:12:23,902 --> 00:12:26,946
<i>The needle dissolves
once it enters the body.</i>

183
00:12:27,572 --> 00:12:29,657
<i>It raises blood pressure momentarily,</i>

184
00:12:29,741 --> 00:12:32,368
<i>so it's perfect to disguise
as a heart attack.</i>

185
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:36,497
Don't worry, sir.

186
00:12:36,581 --> 00:12:37,582
One more thing.

187
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:40,418
Find my daughter.

188
00:12:40,501 --> 00:12:43,254
I think the bastard No. 105
took her abroad.

189
00:12:43,338 --> 00:12:46,925
No. 105 probably used a fake ID,
so start by looking for Jiu.

190
00:12:48,343 --> 00:12:50,136
Expenses and passports.

191
00:12:51,095 --> 00:12:52,263
Take the boys with you.

192
00:12:55,725 --> 00:12:57,060
Yes, sir.

193
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:58,144
Mark my words.

194
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:01,147
Don't you dare hurt my daughter Jiu.

195
00:13:02,231 --> 00:13:04,567
Be extra careful,
so she doesn't get scared.

196
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,402
I understand.

197
00:13:07,695 --> 00:13:10,573
What should I do with No. 105?

198
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:16,704
In order for Jiu to get back safely,
we're going to need him.

199
00:13:18,289 --> 00:13:19,290
But upon arrival…

200
00:13:21,709 --> 00:13:22,835
the rest is up to you.

201
00:13:24,045 --> 00:13:25,546
Or you can get rid of him.

202
00:13:28,049 --> 00:13:29,050
Yes, sir.

203
00:13:31,594 --> 00:13:32,595
Let's go.

204
00:13:40,144 --> 00:13:42,480
<i>What do you think you're doing?</i>

205
00:13:42,563 --> 00:13:45,066
<i>Press is criticizing us
for preferential treatment.</i>

206
00:13:45,149 --> 00:13:47,568
<i>Mr. Han wants an all-out investigation.</i>

207
00:13:47,652 --> 00:13:49,112
<i>You have a warrant?</i>

208
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:51,364
- <i>Start searching.
</i>-<i>Yes, sir.</i>

209
00:13:51,447 --> 00:13:54,617
<i>Any thoughts on Mr. Han's push
for the police to investigate you?</i>

210
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:56,494
Tell us about Mr. Han's actions

211
00:13:56,577 --> 00:13:58,913
that resulted in the illegal home search.

212
00:13:58,997 --> 00:14:01,290
FROM HATCH TO PRESIDENT
NO. 1 BRAIN PYO JAEHYUN

213
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:02,542
To be honest…

214
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:05,586
I started to question myself.

215
00:14:07,296 --> 00:14:11,092
Is the presidency important enough
to make my beloved wife suffer?

216
00:14:12,176 --> 00:14:16,139
Due to recent events, my wife
has been showing symptoms of delusion.

217
00:14:17,974 --> 00:14:19,434
I'm just an ordinary man.

218
00:14:20,101 --> 00:14:23,396
I'm merely the head of a household,
the husband of my woman.

219
00:14:24,147 --> 00:14:28,818
For the time being, I'm putting a pause
on my campaign to take care of my wife.

220
00:14:30,111 --> 00:14:32,238
I would like to express my sincere apology

221
00:14:33,156 --> 00:14:35,575
to the supporters who have stuck with me.

222
00:14:36,868 --> 00:14:39,412
Will you withdraw from candidacy?

223
00:14:42,623 --> 00:14:45,126
I'm too embarrassed
to look you in the eyes, sir.

224
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:47,962
It was my duty to protect you to the end,

225
00:14:48,046 --> 00:14:49,589
but I was so arrogant.

226
00:14:49,672 --> 00:14:51,340
I'm so sorry, sir.

227
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:52,842
We're sorry.

228
00:14:54,343 --> 00:14:56,262
I've also made mistakes.

229
00:14:57,221 --> 00:14:59,724
I'll keep your words of advice
close to my heart.

230
00:15:02,643 --> 00:15:04,270
I'm just happy you're back.

231
00:15:04,812 --> 00:15:08,399
As I mentioned earlier, I'll be
spending time with my wife for now.

232
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:11,069
Please adjust the remaining itinerary.

233
00:15:11,152 --> 00:15:14,072
Don't worry, sir.
Ms. Hong's health always comes first.

234
00:15:14,155 --> 00:15:17,408
The press is already raving
about your brave decision.

235
00:15:17,492 --> 00:15:19,410
You've gained more supporters, sir.

236
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:21,704
Hang in there, sir!

237
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:25,083
Thank you
for giving us another chance.

238
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:27,543
- Thank you, sir!
- Thank you, sir!

239
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,217
<i>I'm only asking for one thing.</i>

240
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,844
<i>A sincere apology
from Candidate Han Kyungrok.</i>

241
00:15:36,928 --> 00:15:38,638
PYO JAEHYUN
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE

242
00:15:38,721 --> 00:15:42,016
<i>As a veteran politician,
should Mr. Han reflect on his actions...</i>

243
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,268
Reflect? Apology?

244
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:47,730
He's trying to screw me over, isn't he?

245
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:50,817
I'm going to die, seriously.

246
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:54,946
I might just die of embarrassment.

247
00:15:55,029 --> 00:15:57,573
Exactly what this says!

248
00:15:57,657 --> 00:16:00,493
"If I were Han, I would've died
of embarrassment by now."

249
00:16:00,576 --> 00:16:04,080
"Time to put on a brave face.
It's Han's greatest talent, after all."

250
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:08,084
Wow, this person must be a real fan, sir!

251
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:10,211
What will you do?

252
00:16:10,294 --> 00:16:13,297
Are you going to apologize
or put on a brave face?

253
00:16:13,381 --> 00:16:14,549
Mr. Ahn.

254
00:16:14,632 --> 00:16:16,926
Is this amusing to you?

255
00:16:17,426 --> 00:16:18,636
- Mr. Han!
- That idiot…

256
00:16:18,719 --> 00:16:20,513
Mr. Han! Mr. Han!

257
00:16:20,596 --> 00:16:22,849
Detective Joo is
under internal investigation,

258
00:16:22,932 --> 00:16:24,642
and just his phone alone

259
00:16:24,725 --> 00:16:27,687
will provide more than enough evidence
of your involvement.

260
00:16:29,147 --> 00:16:30,398
What... what should we do?

261
00:16:30,481 --> 00:16:32,900
You think you're safe?

262
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:35,695
If I go down,
you're all going down with me.

263
00:16:35,778 --> 00:16:39,031
We'll all be buried alive.
All of us six feet under!

264
00:16:39,115 --> 00:16:40,408
You morons.

265
00:16:46,414 --> 00:16:47,498
Where are we going?

266
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:50,418
You going to feed me before you kill me?

267
00:16:51,419 --> 00:16:53,254
There's no need to be nervous.

268
00:16:53,337 --> 00:16:56,632
I'm only trying to take back
what you took from me, Father.

269
00:16:57,508 --> 00:16:58,551
Hello, Chairman.

270
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:02,263
What are you doing here, Mr. Won?

271
00:17:02,847 --> 00:17:05,600
It's been a while, Mr. Won.
Have you been well?

272
00:17:05,683 --> 00:17:08,394
Of course.
How have you been, Anchorwoman Ko?

273
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:12,857
Since you left, the news ratings
just aren't the same.

274
00:17:14,025 --> 00:17:15,401
Did you hear that, Father?

275
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,155
Once Ms. Ko returns,
viewership will go right back up.

276
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:20,781
She was the face of YBC.

277
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:23,242
It was no average incident.

278
00:17:24,035 --> 00:17:27,246
Credibility is everything to a journalist.
Won't be easy, will it?

279
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:29,498
Let's not waste energy on the impossible.

280
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:33,085
People tend to forget easily,
and your image is only what you make it.

281
00:17:33,169 --> 00:17:36,756
Besides, you've agreed
to such a big advertisement.

282
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:39,217
- I'll take care of it myself.
- What advertisement?

283
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:43,346
Didn't you want
an exclusive contract with YBC

284
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:46,098
for Kumjo distribution
and production advertisements?

285
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:48,434
Thank you for making

286
00:17:48,517 --> 00:17:50,937
such a big decision
for my comeback, Father.

287
00:17:51,729 --> 00:17:52,980
Thank you, Chairman Jang.

288
00:17:53,064 --> 00:17:55,066
What the hell are you trying to pull?

289
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:57,568
He wishes for me to cover

290
00:17:57,652 --> 00:18:01,280
the story about my father's murder case
as an exclusive report.

291
00:18:02,031 --> 00:18:03,783
They were very close friends.

292
00:18:03,866 --> 00:18:05,826
Of course, I'm well aware.

293
00:18:06,744 --> 00:18:07,995
Isn't that right, Father?

294
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:13,000
You always said we must find the suspect
who ordered the hit

295
00:18:13,542 --> 00:18:15,211
and punish him severely.

296
00:18:19,715 --> 00:18:23,552
The chairman wants me
to move up to a desk position,

297
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,347
but that would be asking
for too much, right?

298
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:29,767
Not at all. After all that you've
contributed to our station?

299
00:18:30,434 --> 00:18:31,811
No worries, Chairman Jang.

300
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:37,358
What position can you offer

301
00:18:38,651 --> 00:18:40,528
my daughter-in-law?

302
00:18:40,611 --> 00:18:43,155
You'll be pleased with the position
I'll give her.

303
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,825
Father, let's eat.

304
00:18:45,908 --> 00:18:48,953
This restaurant is known
for their buldojang, your favorite.

305
00:19:07,263 --> 00:19:10,266
- What's that? What's going on?
- Hey, go check inside!

306
00:19:19,608 --> 00:19:20,860
What's going on?

307
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:23,988
Oh, Ms. Hong. Are you all right?

308
00:19:26,907 --> 00:19:29,452
- Seems like a malfunction.
- We'll take a look.

309
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:31,162
There may be another intruder.

310
00:19:31,245 --> 00:19:33,331
Everything seems fine, so please leave.

311
00:19:34,582 --> 00:19:37,835
Any more of this, and this will be
an invasion of privacy.

312
00:19:37,918 --> 00:19:38,919
Yes, ma'am.

313
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:50,556
Kyojin?

314
00:19:52,266 --> 00:19:53,768
What are you doing here?

315
00:19:53,851 --> 00:19:57,063
Taera, you okay? I couldn't get
a hold of you. I was so worried.

316
00:19:57,146 --> 00:20:00,941
- Did you set off the security alarm?
- Yes.

317
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:03,861
I needed to
distract the security.

318
00:20:07,198 --> 00:20:09,533
About Mr. Uhm, was it Jaehyun?

319
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:12,578
Yes.

320
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,833
He framed Mr. Uhm as the suspect,
then killed him to get me out.

321
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:20,711
He's killing anyone who knows his secret,
one at a time.

322
00:20:21,337 --> 00:20:22,963
You're in danger too, Taera.

323
00:20:23,047 --> 00:20:26,342
I'll do whatever I can to stop Jaehyun,
so you should go to Jiu.

324
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:28,302
There's a safe house for you two.

325
00:20:28,386 --> 00:20:30,137
You can't do it on your own.

326
00:20:30,846 --> 00:20:33,474
This is something I have to finish myself.

327
00:20:33,557 --> 00:20:34,892
Is this your guilt talking?

328
00:20:36,102 --> 00:20:39,855
You've done nothing wrong. Why do you
keep putting yourself in danger?

329
00:20:40,981 --> 00:20:42,191
At least for Jiu's sake,

330
00:20:43,067 --> 00:20:44,568
I have to take care of myself.

331
00:20:47,029 --> 00:20:49,907
By the way,
did you find the Hatch flash drive?

332
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:52,451
Sungchan has it,
but I think it's been damaged.

333
00:20:52,993 --> 00:20:55,329
I saw errors occur
in the smart patch software.

334
00:20:55,413 --> 00:20:58,124
Does that mean they won't be able
to give the presentation?

335
00:20:58,207 --> 00:20:59,208
No.

336
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:01,460
Sungchan will push ahead, no matter what.

337
00:21:01,544 --> 00:21:04,380
To take over Hatch, he has to give
a successful presentation.

338
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:06,924
Those errors will occur
during the demonstration,

339
00:21:07,007 --> 00:21:08,676
then I'll expose everything.

340
00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:09,760
What about Sujeong?

341
00:21:10,261 --> 00:21:11,804
Did you search the lab at Hatch?

342
00:21:13,055 --> 00:21:15,391
She's not on the list of employees.

343
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:19,186
But I can't shake the feeling that
she was involved in the research at Hatch.

344
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:23,107
The guys don't have the skills it takes
to complete the research on their own.

345
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:25,818
Can you send me the files
you have on Sujeong?

346
00:21:26,694 --> 00:21:28,779
I'll do my own digging from here.

347
00:21:28,863 --> 00:21:29,864
Okay.

348
00:21:31,532 --> 00:21:33,534
- You should go now.
- Taera.

349
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:35,327
Here.

350
00:21:36,745 --> 00:21:38,372
I installed a tracking device.

351
00:21:38,456 --> 00:21:39,915
Only because I'm so worried.

352
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:41,542
Call me if anything happens.

353
00:22:04,482 --> 00:22:05,983
Chairman.

354
00:22:06,066 --> 00:22:07,776
I didn't know you were coming.

355
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,279
I was wondering
how preparations were going.

356
00:22:11,489 --> 00:22:13,574
You succeed in the smart patch test?

357
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:16,785
Director Koo has been working on it alone.

358
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:20,873
He won't let us near the special lab,
so I haven't seen it for myself yet.

359
00:22:20,956 --> 00:22:23,417
It's because he's desperate
to take over Hatch.

360
00:22:23,918 --> 00:22:26,212
We just need this to go well.

361
00:22:26,295 --> 00:22:28,797
Hatch needs to be strong
for my campaign to be strong.

362
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:32,426
Keep an eye on Sungchan,
so he doesn't try anything funny.

363
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:33,928
Don't worry, Chairman.

364
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:38,057
Dr. Yang, your nose is bleeding.

365
00:22:42,478 --> 00:22:45,356
I must be stressed
because of the presentation.

366
00:22:45,439 --> 00:22:48,275
- I'll buy you a new handkerchief, sir.
- It's fine.

367
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:51,570
You don't look so well.
Have you been taking your medication?

368
00:22:51,654 --> 00:22:54,990
Lately, I've been having migraines,
even when I take my medicine.

369
00:22:55,616 --> 00:22:58,285
It's medication tolerance.
Time for stronger meds.

370
00:22:59,537 --> 00:23:01,664
Meet me at the lab after the presentation.

371
00:23:15,177 --> 00:23:17,805
I never imagined that
a respectable physician like you

372
00:23:17,888 --> 00:23:20,516
would have a skeleton
in your closet, Dr. Hwang.

373
00:23:21,475 --> 00:23:23,644
An affair? I'm in shock.

374
00:23:25,646 --> 00:23:28,315
What is it you want, Mr. Jang?

375
00:23:28,399 --> 00:23:30,067
It's nothing much, Dr. Hwang.

376
00:23:31,068 --> 00:23:33,821
On the day of the Hatch presentation,
I'd appreciate it

377
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:36,824
if you could prevent Kyojin from coming.

378
00:23:39,243 --> 00:23:42,496
Don't you want to live the rest
of your life as a respectable man?

379
00:23:43,706 --> 00:23:47,459
After all, you're my mother's doctor,
whom she trusts and relies on the most.

380
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,842
When are they coming out?

381
00:23:54,925 --> 00:23:56,427
Oh, here he comes!

382
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:57,678
Take a picture!

383
00:23:57,761 --> 00:23:59,346
Hurry! Take pictures!

384
00:24:01,974 --> 00:24:03,392
Sorry I'm late.

385
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:05,311
I had to get my wife her medicine.

386
00:24:05,394 --> 00:24:09,815
I didn't realize you were
such a caring husband, Mr. Pyo.

387
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:13,694
You have something to say?

388
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:16,030
Oh, that…

389
00:24:20,576 --> 00:24:22,161
I... I...

390
00:24:25,998 --> 00:24:27,041
Please leave now.

391
00:24:28,459 --> 00:24:30,085
My wife needs more time.

392
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:33,964
She says she's not ready to
meet you all just yet.

393
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:36,675
Is her mind a bit frail?

394
00:24:36,759 --> 00:24:39,511
These sorts of things happen in life.

395
00:24:39,595 --> 00:24:41,430
How about I go in, alone?

396
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:44,141
As wives, we understand each other.

397
00:24:44,975 --> 00:24:49,730
Once she opens up to me,
she'll feel a lot better, okay?

398
00:24:50,564 --> 00:24:51,940
I'll make a group chat.

399
00:24:52,608 --> 00:24:54,443
Here, give me her number.

400
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:57,988
Wow, now I'm asking
for her number.

401
00:24:58,072 --> 00:25:00,032
- Excuse me, ma'am. Please come with me.
- Huh?

402
00:25:00,115 --> 00:25:01,408
- This way, please.
- Why?

403
00:25:01,492 --> 00:25:04,787
- I didn't get her number yet.
- I have something to discuss with you.

404
00:25:05,454 --> 00:25:09,500
I'm sincerely sorry, Mr. Pyo.
I took some time to self-reflect.

405
00:25:09,583 --> 00:25:12,836
I'm deeply sorry
for all the cruel things I've done.

406
00:25:20,511 --> 00:25:22,805
I know this isn't enough
to quell your anger.

407
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:25,808
If I could, I'd get on my knees.

408
00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:27,101
But unfortunately,

409
00:25:27,184 --> 00:25:30,187
I had joint replacement surgery,
so I can't bend my knees.

410
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:31,814
What can I do? Shall I…

411
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:34,608
have my people kneel
before you instead, Mr. Pyo?

412
00:25:35,651 --> 00:25:37,486
Just promise me one thing.

413
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:39,863
For the remainder of the election cycle,

414
00:25:39,947 --> 00:25:42,074
let's behave like gentlemen.

415
00:25:42,157 --> 00:25:44,785
Wouldn't that be better,
no matter what the outcome?

416
00:25:44,868 --> 00:25:45,869
I agree.

417
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:48,414
I consider myself a gentleman.

418
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:51,083
Let's play fair,
no matter what the outcome,

419
00:25:51,166 --> 00:25:53,168
so that we don't embarrass ourselves.

420
00:26:36,754 --> 00:26:39,923
<i>It must've shattered
when it was struck by lightning.</i>

421
00:26:40,007 --> 00:26:42,134
I saw him hide it in a locker at the dock.

422
00:26:50,434 --> 00:26:51,602
You can't leave, ma'am.

423
00:26:52,394 --> 00:26:54,271
I can't even jog within the property?

424
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:56,732
He said I can't even exercise?

425
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:58,525
I'll try asking, ma'am.

426
00:26:58,609 --> 00:26:59,902
I'll go with her.

427
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:04,698
Tell Mr. Pyo
that I'll be jogging with her.

428
00:27:18,212 --> 00:27:19,755
What are we doing here?

429
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:21,131
Stand guard.

430
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:27,262
PYO JAEHYUN

431
00:27:53,121 --> 00:27:54,373
REPUBLIC OF KOREA PASSPORT

432
00:27:54,456 --> 00:27:55,582
What's all this?

433
00:27:58,418 --> 00:28:01,922
Isn't that Dr. Yang Sejin?
Why does Jaehyun have this?

434
00:28:02,005 --> 00:28:04,216
Isn't it odd that these are hidden here?

435
00:28:05,217 --> 00:28:07,427
There's something here
we can use against him.

436
00:28:07,511 --> 00:28:09,054
We have to find it fast.

437
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:13,141
His approval rating will surge
after the Hatch presentation.

438
00:28:13,225 --> 00:28:15,519
If we don't stop him,
he may become untouchable.

439
00:28:15,602 --> 00:28:17,145
We have to stop him.

440
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:19,857
The election is happening soon.

441
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:22,901
I should look into
Dr. Yang Sejin.

442
00:28:22,985 --> 00:28:25,737
Security will be looking for you.
Go home first.

443
00:28:25,821 --> 00:28:27,990
I'll get someone to clean up this place.

444
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:29,783
Okay, thanks.

445
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
(noonaspoiler.site)

446
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:36,136
This presentation will decide
the future of Hatch.

447
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:39,556
Everyone has to acknowledge
that the Hatch we've created

448
00:28:40,641 --> 00:28:42,643
is a place of undeniable accomplishment.

449
00:28:43,894 --> 00:28:45,020
Okay.

450
00:28:45,938 --> 00:28:48,524
Hey, this has to be a complete success.
Got it?

451
00:28:48,607 --> 00:28:53,070
Last time, it was only half a success
because Red died.

452
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:54,905
Why you little...

453
00:28:55,405 --> 00:28:58,075
Why'd you bring up Red?
You just ruined my mood, damn it.

454
00:29:00,619 --> 00:29:01,620
What about Kyojin?

455
00:29:02,371 --> 00:29:03,497
You take care of him?

456
00:29:08,085 --> 00:29:10,837
He's not fully recovered yet.

457
00:29:10,921 --> 00:29:13,298
For the time being,
he needs to be careful.

458
00:29:13,382 --> 00:29:18,011
I... I have somewhere to be.
The presentation is starting soon.

459
00:29:18,595 --> 00:29:19,846
You shouldn't move.

460
00:29:20,472 --> 00:29:23,350
I'll give you some supplements,
so get some rest for today.

461
00:29:25,769 --> 00:29:26,853
But I have to go.

462
00:29:32,818 --> 00:29:34,820
HUMAN SMART PATCH PRESENTATION

463
00:29:46,832 --> 00:29:48,083
In 2021,

464
00:29:48,709 --> 00:29:52,296
the World Basketball Championship was
globally the hottest trending topic.

465
00:29:52,379 --> 00:29:54,798
The MVP of that championship,

466
00:29:54,881 --> 00:29:56,008
a god of basketball,

467
00:29:56,091 --> 00:29:58,427
an idol of basketball...

468
00:29:58,510 --> 00:29:59,678
Jung Subin.

469
00:30:11,565 --> 00:30:16,111
Due to an unfortunate accident,
Jung Subin's legs are paralyzed.

470
00:30:16,194 --> 00:30:17,195
Currently,

471
00:30:17,821 --> 00:30:21,950
he's playing very well
on the wheelchair basketball team.

472
00:30:22,701 --> 00:30:27,497
Hatch would like to present a miracle

473
00:30:27,998 --> 00:30:30,250
to Jung Subin, our hero.

474
00:30:31,043 --> 00:30:32,044
By using…

475
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:38,342
this human smart patch.

476
00:30:42,095 --> 00:30:47,017
Today, everyone here will be able to see
basketball player Jung Subin

477
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:50,937
score an amazing dunk shot
just like the old days.

478
00:31:11,917 --> 00:31:15,379
Today, we are all on the same team.

479
00:31:27,474 --> 00:31:29,226
Almost there, Koo Sungchan.

480
00:31:30,394 --> 00:31:31,728
You can do it.

481
00:31:34,815 --> 00:31:36,775
Let's begin the live demonstration.

482
00:31:40,153 --> 00:31:41,530
How do you feel?

483
00:31:42,531 --> 00:31:44,241
I'm all right, Director.

484
00:31:45,951 --> 00:31:50,372
Then I'll raise the stimulation to 50.

485
00:31:59,631 --> 00:32:01,425
Can you try raising your leg?

486
00:32:18,108 --> 00:32:21,027
I will raise the stimulation to 70.

487
00:32:21,695 --> 00:32:24,990
This time, grab the rails before you

488
00:32:25,073 --> 00:32:27,033
and stand up on your feet.

489
00:32:36,585 --> 00:32:37,669
Oh!

490
00:32:54,436 --> 00:32:56,563
Great job, Subin.

491
00:32:56,646 --> 00:32:58,857
Now, we're at the final stage.

492
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:01,651
I'll maximize the stimulation.

493
00:33:14,164 --> 00:33:15,415
It hurts.

494
00:33:15,499 --> 00:33:18,752
That's because your motor nerves
are operating at full capacity.

495
00:33:18,835 --> 00:33:19,836
It's fine. Okay?

496
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,047
I'm in so much pain. I can't do it.

497
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:24,299
Don't be scared.

498
00:33:24,382 --> 00:33:27,052
Just try moving once. Got it?

499
00:33:27,636 --> 00:33:29,471
Just take one step.

500
00:33:29,554 --> 00:33:31,223
One step, okay!

501
00:33:31,306 --> 00:33:32,766
Just one more step!

502
00:33:33,683 --> 00:33:34,684
Okay!

503
00:33:48,198 --> 00:33:49,699
Hurry, do something.

504
00:33:51,785 --> 00:33:53,328
What's the problem?

505
00:33:53,411 --> 00:33:55,747
Is the human patch too dangerous to use?

506
00:33:55,831 --> 00:33:57,582
Is the smart patch a failure?

507
00:33:57,666 --> 00:33:59,251
Give us an answer!

508
00:33:59,334 --> 00:34:03,129
Is Hatch's human smart patch a failure?

509
00:34:04,881 --> 00:34:06,049
Hey, Sungchan.

510
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:07,801
Director Koo!

511
00:34:10,303 --> 00:34:11,930
I will answer that question.

512
00:34:13,849 --> 00:34:14,850
Bring him out.

513
00:34:19,312 --> 00:34:21,356
- Who's that?
- Who is that?

514
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:24,651
- It's Jang Kyojin!
- Jang Kyojin of Kumjo?

515
00:34:25,569 --> 00:34:26,903
Yes, you're right.

516
00:34:26,987 --> 00:34:29,573
Kumjo chairman's older son, Jang Kyojin.

517
00:34:29,656 --> 00:34:34,202
He was a colleague I respected the most,
someone I worshipped.

518
00:34:42,961 --> 00:34:46,006
The size of my pills
was slightly different.

519
00:34:46,089 --> 00:34:47,883
You must've changed my prescription.

520
00:34:48,842 --> 00:34:50,343
Did Dojin put you up to this?

521
00:34:53,013 --> 00:34:54,014
I'm so sorry.

522
00:34:54,681 --> 00:34:56,057
Please forgive me, ma'am.

523
00:34:56,892 --> 00:34:59,644
Mother, you deal with Dr. Hwang.
I have to go.

524
00:34:59,728 --> 00:35:03,023
I want to see the look on their faces
when they've failed.

525
00:35:19,789 --> 00:35:21,166
We're on our way, Chairman.

526
00:35:26,463 --> 00:35:29,633
There were many rumors
about the accident. How is he doing now?

527
00:35:29,716 --> 00:35:32,469
Is he still unconscious?
He looks very healthy.

528
00:35:32,552 --> 00:35:34,554
Has he been getting rehabilitation?

529
00:35:35,388 --> 00:35:36,806
As you all know,

530
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:39,976
Jang Kyojin was in a coma for seven years.

531
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:42,020
He was in a vegetative state.

532
00:35:42,103 --> 00:35:45,273
No medical technology could save him.

533
00:35:45,357 --> 00:35:47,734
But Hatch was different.

534
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:17,681
How did this miracle happen?
Has he been in rehab?

535
00:36:17,764 --> 00:36:20,976
When did he wake up? What treatment
did he get? Please tell us!

536
00:36:21,059 --> 00:36:22,435
Actually,

537
00:36:22,519 --> 00:36:27,065
Mr. Jang was our human trial subject
for Hatch's smart patch.

538
00:36:27,148 --> 00:36:28,650
As you can see now,

539
00:36:28,733 --> 00:36:31,820
he was revived
through our rehabilitation program.

540
00:36:33,279 --> 00:36:35,115
He is living proof

541
00:36:35,198 --> 00:36:36,700
of the smart patch's success.

542
00:36:36,783 --> 00:36:38,493
Whoa.

543
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:43,373
Then why
did the experiment fail on Jung Subin?

544
00:36:46,209 --> 00:36:48,003
It must be a systematic error.

545
00:36:49,045 --> 00:36:51,589
Director Koo isn't used to the stage.

546
00:36:51,673 --> 00:36:53,717
I believe he's a little nervous.

547
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,510
He usually doesn't make mistakes.

548
00:37:00,849 --> 00:37:03,351
You're looking exceptionally well today.

549
00:37:03,435 --> 00:37:04,686
Care to pitch in, Kyojin?

550
00:37:09,983 --> 00:37:11,609
Accept it.

551
00:37:11,693 --> 00:37:14,070
You did wake up,
thanks to our rehab program.

552
00:37:27,042 --> 00:37:29,210
I never expected to greet you like this.

553
00:37:29,878 --> 00:37:32,630
It's been a long while. I'm Jang Kyojin.

554
00:37:36,634 --> 00:37:39,054
I see that we have
many reporters here today.

555
00:37:39,137 --> 00:37:41,890
May I take this chance
to express my words of gratitude?

556
00:37:46,311 --> 00:37:47,604
Seven years ago,

557
00:37:47,687 --> 00:37:50,774
I got into a motorbike accident,
while I went off-roading.

558
00:37:51,858 --> 00:37:54,194
Someone had tampered with my brakes,

559
00:37:54,694 --> 00:37:58,239
then pushed me down a cliff,
while I was barely there hanging.

560
00:38:03,369 --> 00:38:04,954
The person who made me this way…

561
00:38:06,664 --> 00:38:07,832
is Koo Sungchan.

562
00:38:08,416 --> 00:38:10,085
- Huh?
- What?

563
00:38:10,168 --> 00:38:11,169
Jang Dojin…

564
00:38:11,252 --> 00:38:12,670
- What?
- What?

565
00:38:14,589 --> 00:38:15,590
…and Pyo Jaehyun.

566
00:38:15,673 --> 00:38:16,966
- What?
- Impossible!

567
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:22,806
It's these three men.

568
00:38:23,473 --> 00:38:25,350
What are you saying, sir?

569
00:38:25,433 --> 00:38:28,103
Do you mean these three were involved
in your accident?

570
00:38:31,022 --> 00:38:32,023
No.

571
00:38:33,024 --> 00:38:36,361
They're the reason
I'm standing here on my own two feet.

572
00:38:36,945 --> 00:38:38,613
Ah.

573
00:38:41,074 --> 00:38:43,326
As you can see, I stand as a healthy man,

574
00:38:43,409 --> 00:38:46,204
and Hatch's smart patch
is a complete success.

575
00:38:46,287 --> 00:38:49,791
Please give a hand to the three heroes
at Hatch who never gave up on me

576
00:38:50,375 --> 00:38:51,501
to the very end.

577
00:39:05,682 --> 00:39:08,768
<i>Hold on, the brakes aren't working!</i>

578
00:39:10,645 --> 00:39:12,147
Kyojin, what's wrong?

579
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:13,273
Did something happen?

580
00:39:13,356 --> 00:39:14,816
Kyojin.

581
00:39:30,582 --> 00:39:31,583
<i>If he finds out,</i>

582
00:39:31,666 --> 00:39:34,794
he'll kick us out of the team.
No, he'll call the police on us.

583
00:39:34,878 --> 00:39:37,463
Hey, what if we all go to jail for murder?

584
00:39:37,547 --> 00:39:39,549
Just shut up, you jackass.

585
00:39:40,967 --> 00:39:43,970
<i>Kyojin, I'm sorry,
but I have put myself first.</i>

586
00:39:58,526 --> 00:40:00,320
<i>Why do you always get in my way?</i>

587
00:40:01,154 --> 00:40:02,238
<i>You're so irritating.</i>

588
00:40:26,679 --> 00:40:28,348
They're here already?

589
00:40:31,643 --> 00:40:32,644
Oh, Mr. Won.

590
00:40:32,727 --> 00:40:34,479
- What's this?
- Is she back?

591
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:38,399
Sorry for the surprise.
The personnel appointment notice is up.

592
00:40:38,483 --> 00:40:42,195
Back from her hiatus,
say hello to your new Chief, Ko Haesoo.

593
00:40:42,278 --> 00:40:45,531
She'll take charge of the news desk.

594
00:40:45,615 --> 00:40:48,993
I'm glad to be back.
I'll be counting on all of you.

595
00:40:50,662 --> 00:40:52,580
Why are we just standing? Clap, clap!

596
00:40:52,664 --> 00:40:55,083
Oh, my. Pleased to see you again, Anchor...

597
00:40:55,792 --> 00:40:56,960
Chief Ko, that's right.

598
00:40:58,253 --> 00:40:59,379
Hello, Mr. Park.

599
00:41:00,046 --> 00:41:01,923
Life is full of surprises.

600
00:41:02,006 --> 00:41:03,925
You never know who or what to expect.

601
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:11,099
- We'll have a staff restructure meeting.
- Hey, let's get ready.

602
00:41:14,435 --> 00:41:16,813
I've felt so wronged throughout the years.

603
00:41:17,313 --> 00:41:20,066
I studied like hell,
and entered here with a top score.

604
00:41:20,608 --> 00:41:23,194
I even graduated at the top of my class,
and yet…

605
00:41:23,278 --> 00:41:26,155
"Her father-in-law helped her.
Kumjo Group pulled strings."

606
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:28,866
People continued to label me
as a product of nepotism.

607
00:41:29,534 --> 00:41:31,661
Some envied me for being born

608
00:41:31,744 --> 00:41:35,498
with a silver spoon in my mouth,
for having powerful in-laws.

609
00:41:35,581 --> 00:41:37,750
But to be honest, I worked so hard.

610
00:41:37,834 --> 00:41:39,419
I know I have great skill.

611
00:41:40,128 --> 00:41:41,504
All that for what?

612
00:41:41,587 --> 00:41:44,173
People aren't interested
in the truth anyway.

613
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,301
Right?

614
00:41:49,095 --> 00:41:51,472
So I decided to make use
of my connections.

615
00:41:51,556 --> 00:41:54,017
I got this seat
through my connections anyway,

616
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:56,185
I might as well
host the eight o'clock news.

617
00:41:56,269 --> 00:41:59,314
Ms. Ko, you can't do this
on such short notice.

618
00:41:59,397 --> 00:42:01,441
- That's my spot...
- Please, just stop.

619
00:42:01,524 --> 00:42:03,693
It's called a power trip, isn't it?

620
00:42:03,776 --> 00:42:07,447
If this angers you, you can leave.
Tell people I stole your spot.

621
00:42:08,531 --> 00:42:11,743
People accused me of things I never did,
so I may as well do it.

622
00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:16,622
Besides, I have a report
to announce during that time slot.

623
00:42:24,464 --> 00:42:27,008
Every research you've conducted at Hatch

624
00:42:27,884 --> 00:42:30,136
came from stolen files from Kyojin.

625
00:42:32,055 --> 00:42:35,141
Why didn't you tell me about
the glitch earlier?

626
00:42:35,224 --> 00:42:37,435
If you had, I would've taken care of it!

627
00:42:37,935 --> 00:42:41,272
Kyojin's the only person
who can code that software anyway.

628
00:42:41,773 --> 00:42:43,733
That's why you wanted it too.

629
00:42:45,234 --> 00:42:46,277
I already know.

630
00:42:47,153 --> 00:42:49,906
That you had Yura
steal the flash drive from me.

631
00:42:50,698 --> 00:42:53,159
Taera simply found it
and returned it to me.

632
00:42:53,701 --> 00:42:54,702
Hey, jackass.

633
00:42:55,495 --> 00:42:58,706
You're much worse of a coward
and a loser than I am.

634
00:42:58,790 --> 00:43:01,959
If it weren't for me,
you would've looked like a moron today.

635
00:43:03,002 --> 00:43:06,005
You can't handle this,
and yet, you vie for Hatch's top spot?

636
00:43:07,632 --> 00:43:09,342
It's always been mine.

637
00:43:09,425 --> 00:43:11,177
You'll hand it to me soon enough.

638
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:12,261
You know why?

639
00:43:12,345 --> 00:43:14,764
Because you have to become the president!

640
00:43:17,517 --> 00:43:18,601
What?

641
00:43:19,852 --> 00:43:20,853
Yo, scumbag.

642
00:43:22,313 --> 00:43:23,815
You killed Yura, didn't you?

643
00:43:24,482 --> 00:43:27,235
The blood-stained watch you got
as your wedding gift.

644
00:43:27,318 --> 00:43:28,528
I have it.

645
00:43:29,362 --> 00:43:30,363
It's time…

646
00:43:31,614 --> 00:43:32,698
to pay for your sins.

647
00:43:34,242 --> 00:43:36,411
What? You scared?

648
00:43:44,335 --> 00:43:46,295
I guess this is why we're friends.

649
00:43:48,131 --> 00:43:49,424
I regret to say this,

650
00:43:50,925 --> 00:43:52,718
but I have something similar…

651
00:43:55,346 --> 00:43:56,639
from seven years ago.

652
00:43:57,890 --> 00:44:00,059
The evidence you tried to kill Kyojin.

653
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:06,315
What, you crazy douchebag?

654
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:09,152
You were more heartless than I thought.

655
00:44:10,403 --> 00:44:12,488
After tampering with Kyojin's brakes,

656
00:44:12,572 --> 00:44:14,615
you went to verify his death. Now that...

657
00:44:16,242 --> 00:44:18,202
I was so scared, I almost screamed.

658
00:44:20,788 --> 00:44:22,874
Kyojin was quite fond of you, though.

659
00:44:23,916 --> 00:44:26,085
He'd be so let down if he found out.

660
00:44:27,003 --> 00:44:28,629
No.

661
00:44:28,713 --> 00:44:30,590
He probably knows already.

662
00:44:30,673 --> 00:44:33,009
He just saw you with his flash drive.

663
00:44:33,885 --> 00:44:37,930
Wow, Kyojin's benevolent as ever.

664
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:40,016
Don't you think?

665
00:44:45,062 --> 00:44:49,609
Come see me, if you're curious to see
how you looked when you tried to kill him.

666
00:44:50,776 --> 00:44:53,029
The footage was shot
at a pretty good angle.

667
00:45:14,133 --> 00:45:15,468
Mr. Jang Kyojin.

668
00:45:16,844 --> 00:45:18,429
You did well today.

669
00:45:19,055 --> 00:45:20,973
Your speech was impressive.

670
00:45:22,391 --> 00:45:23,976
HATCH RESEARCH TEAM - SEJIN Y.

671
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:25,269
Dr. Yang Sejin?

672
00:45:28,564 --> 00:45:30,066
Are you a researcher at Hatch?

673
00:45:32,193 --> 00:45:34,111
Yes. See you around.

674
00:45:41,911 --> 00:45:43,704
You never disappoint, Kyojin.

675
00:45:45,831 --> 00:45:49,210
If I knew you'd be so cooperative,
I would've been more courteous.

676
00:45:49,293 --> 00:45:53,172
You escaping without telling us,
misled me to think that you hated us.

677
00:45:54,799 --> 00:45:56,217
Was this the only way to go?

678
00:45:57,134 --> 00:45:59,095
What greater proof do we have than you?

679
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:00,972
You admitted to it too.

680
00:46:01,472 --> 00:46:06,102
I have always
sincerely wanted you to wake up.

681
00:46:08,813 --> 00:46:11,023
It wasn't my research technology
you needed?

682
00:46:12,024 --> 00:46:13,985
I'm not Sungchan.

683
00:46:15,152 --> 00:46:16,779
I have a different reason.

684
00:46:19,407 --> 00:46:21,325
Frankly, I've been a bit bored.

685
00:46:22,702 --> 00:46:23,828
You know what I mean.

686
00:46:25,246 --> 00:46:27,623
Neither Sungchan nor Dojin
are on my level.

687
00:46:29,417 --> 00:46:31,627
You would've been a worthy opponent,
had you been awake.

688
00:46:35,256 --> 00:46:38,509
Now I understand why you were
always uncomfortable with me.

689
00:46:40,386 --> 00:46:41,846
You never liked me.

690
00:46:43,055 --> 00:46:45,891
Only you saw right through me
from the get-go.

691
00:46:47,018 --> 00:46:49,437
People are so gullible, you know,

692
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:50,605
because they're dumb.

693
00:46:50,688 --> 00:46:52,732
- Pyo Jaehyun.
- See you around.

694
00:46:54,066 --> 00:46:56,319
It'll be quite entertaining
from here on out.

695
00:47:03,284 --> 00:47:04,744
<i>Good evening, everyone.</i>

696
00:47:04,827 --> 00:47:07,913
Returning to you
on YBC eight o'clock news, I'm Ko Haesoo.

697
00:47:07,997 --> 00:47:09,915
Thank you for all your messages

698
00:47:09,999 --> 00:47:13,002
of concern, support, and encouragement.

699
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:15,755
Using past mistakes as my platform,

700
00:47:15,838 --> 00:47:19,383
I'm returning to you with healthier
and more truthful news reports.

701
00:47:19,467 --> 00:47:22,887
<i>First, Kumjo Group's heir, Jang Kyojin,</i>

702
00:47:22,970 --> 00:47:26,182
<i>made a public appearance today
after long years of medical treatment.</i>

703
00:49:41,233 --> 00:49:43,402
Dr. Yang, you all right?

704
00:49:45,696 --> 00:49:49,617
Jaehyun, where am I?

705
00:49:50,451 --> 00:49:51,786
Where's Kyojin?

706
00:51:21,584 --> 00:51:23,294
<i>I just got off the air.</i>

707
00:51:23,377 --> 00:51:25,713
<i>I made up a convincing excuse to Jaehyun.
See you.</i>

708
00:51:25,796 --> 00:51:26,797
TAERA

709
00:51:33,304 --> 00:51:34,471
I'm glad

710
00:51:35,097 --> 00:51:38,017
that you still have something
to smile about.

711
00:52:06,962 --> 00:52:09,465
Jaehyun, where am I?

712
00:52:10,132 --> 00:52:12,134
Where's Kyojin?

713
00:52:19,183 --> 00:52:20,309
Yes, Taera.

714
00:52:20,392 --> 00:52:23,646
Kyojin, do you know Hatch's
Dr. Yang Sejin personally?

715
00:52:23,729 --> 00:52:25,105
Dr. Yang Sejin?

716
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:28,692
I just met her
at the presentation venue. Why?

717
00:52:29,693 --> 00:52:33,405
I saw her meet with Jaehyun just now.

718
00:52:33,489 --> 00:52:37,201
She mentioned your name.

719
00:52:37,284 --> 00:52:38,577
She called you "Kyojin."

720
00:52:40,245 --> 00:52:41,997
- Are you sure?
- <i>Yes.</i>

721
00:52:42,081 --> 00:52:43,999
I think I should go back there.

722
00:52:44,708 --> 00:52:47,544
There's something off about Dr. Yang.

723
00:52:48,504 --> 00:52:50,547
Where is that lab? I'll meet you there.

724
00:53:07,815 --> 00:53:09,942
BE BACK SOON. SIT TIGHT.

725
00:53:57,489 --> 00:53:59,283
You're back, Ms. Hong.

726
00:54:10,335 --> 00:54:11,503
Pyo Jaehyun.

727
00:54:11,587 --> 00:54:13,130
I told you to do nothing.

728
00:54:24,683 --> 00:54:26,477
INCOMING CALL
KYOJIN

729
00:54:27,227 --> 00:54:28,604
Jang Kyojin?

730
00:56:11,623 --> 00:56:14,334
A FEW DAYS LATER

731
00:58:18,417 --> 00:58:21,503
I was looking for you everywhere.
I thought you were gone.

732
00:58:22,504 --> 00:58:24,298
Where would I go without you?

733
00:58:27,092 --> 00:58:28,802
Mommy!

734
00:58:29,678 --> 00:58:34,683
- Wow, Jiu. You look so pretty today.
- We haven't been to a party in so long.

735
00:58:34,766 --> 00:58:36,518
Let me introduce to you all:

736
00:58:36,601 --> 00:58:39,688
this is my beloved wife, Hong Taera.

737
00:59:25,484 --> 00:59:27,361
Such a great day. I'm so happy.

738
00:59:27,444 --> 00:59:28,945
<i>Did you hypnotize Taera?</i>

739
00:59:29,029 --> 00:59:32,324
You want her to remember that you two
plotted to take revenge against me?

740
00:59:32,407 --> 00:59:35,202
Where's Taera?
She not campaigning with you?

741
00:59:35,285 --> 00:59:37,746
<i>Kyojin
is still looking for Sujeong.</i>

742
00:59:37,829 --> 00:59:41,416
<i>If he reveals what we'd done,
it's over for all of us.</i>

743
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:43,877
<i>Don't ever lay your hands
on Kumjo again.</i>

744
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:45,962
<i>I just
don't give a damn anymore.</i>

745
00:59:46,046 --> 00:59:47,690
<i>Does he want to face death
like his brother?</i>

746
00:59:47,714 --> 00:59:50,008
Ms. Ko, you shouldn't do this
without an appointment.

747
00:59:50,092 --> 00:59:51,551
I'm happy and content right now.

748
00:59:51,635 --> 00:59:55,639
If you talk that way about Jaehyun one
more time, we will never speak again.
