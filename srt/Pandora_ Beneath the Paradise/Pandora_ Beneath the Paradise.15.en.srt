PANDORA: BENEATH THE PARADISE

2
00:00:05,988 --> 00:00:07,078
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

3
00:00:07,159 --> 00:00:08,396
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

4
00:00:08,477 --> 00:00:09,663
SCENES INVOLVING ANIMALS WERE
CREATED WITH PROPS AND VISUAL EFFECTS

5
00:00:09,744 --> 00:00:10,889
AND CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED SAFELY
WITH THE PRESENCE OF THEIR GUARDIANS

6
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:13,180
Hajun, get out of there now.

7
00:00:13,264 --> 00:00:15,683
- Explosives are about to go off.
- What?

8
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:17,476
Explosives?

9
00:00:28,821 --> 00:00:30,572
All the doors are locked.

10
00:00:31,323 --> 00:00:32,533
They're not getting out.

11
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,038
Kyojin.

12
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:42,334
Let's not see each other ever again.

13
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:29,048
ALWAYS ONE TEAM WITH THE PEOPLE
NO. 7, PYO JAEHYUN

14
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:01,038
ALWAYS ONE TEAM WITH THE PEOPLE
NO. 7, PYO JAEHYUN

15
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:05,251
Congratulations, President Pyo Jaehyun!

16
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:08,420
- Pyo Jaehyun!
- Pyo Jaehyun!

17
00:02:08,504 --> 00:02:11,840
- Pyo Jaehyun!
- Pyo Jaehyun!

18
00:02:11,924 --> 00:02:15,052
THE 29TH PRESIDENT
INDEPENDENT PYO JAEHYUN WINS

19
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:20,224
- Pyo Jaehyun!
- Pyo Jaehyun!

20
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:24,895
- Pyo Jaehyun!
- Pyo Jaehyun!

21
00:02:45,249 --> 00:02:46,250
EPISODE 15

22
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:52,089
You look
even more pathetic than I'd imagined.

23
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:58,470
I married you under two conditions.

24
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:02,266
That you'd protect Kumjo, no matter what,

25
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:05,644
and that you'd be a perfect father
to my son Kyojin.

26
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:11,775
But you failed to fulfill the latter
condition when you brought in Dojin.

27
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:13,319
It was a genuine mistake.

28
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,613
A mistake from one night.

29
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:18,782
That's too bad.

30
00:03:20,034 --> 00:03:23,203
You staked your life
on a child you sired by mistake,

31
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:26,373
but he betrayed you and brought you here.

32
00:03:26,457 --> 00:03:27,458
I wanted…

33
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,878
to make things work between us.

34
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:35,507
I did anything and everything you asked
of me, even to the brink of death.

35
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:37,927
You shouldn't have laid a finger on Dojin.

36
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:42,389
Have you not tormented him enough
by getting him to marry Haesoo?

37
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,141
Have you no shame?

38
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,810
What could we have done?
Your son loves Haesoo.

39
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:51,065
Thanks to him, Kumjo was no longer under
suspicion regarding the Ko Taesun case.

40
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:53,734
I am grateful for that, you know.

41
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:55,319
My Dojin is innocent.

42
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:59,990
Leave him alone.
Why draw divine retribution to yourself?

43
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:03,619
If you want to save Dojin,

44
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:06,830
give me what you have.

45
00:04:08,374 --> 00:04:11,794
Hand over all of your Kumjo shares
to Kyojin.

46
00:04:13,796 --> 00:04:16,507
The prosecution will summon Dojin soon.

47
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,259
The sooner you decide, the better.

48
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:20,010
Min Younghwee!

49
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:24,765
Spare your energy.
Looks like you'll be in there for a while.

50
00:04:25,808 --> 00:04:28,852
You look pretty good in prison garb.

51
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:32,731
Don't get all high and mighty!

52
00:04:32,815 --> 00:04:35,442
You never know what lies ahead in life!

53
00:04:35,526 --> 00:04:37,194
The heavens are watching us!

54
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:44,368
"PRESIDENT!"

55
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:49,999
To my fellow Koreans, who trusted
and supported me all this time,

56
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:55,629
today's victory would've been impossible
if it weren't for the campaign staff here.

57
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:57,840
Thank you all.

58
00:04:57,923 --> 00:05:02,136
I will serve this country to repay you
for the trust you've placed in me.

59
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:04,638
"A PRESIDENT WHO COMMUNICATES
ON THE PEOPLE'S SIDE!"

60
00:05:04,722 --> 00:05:06,265
NO. 7 PYO JAEHYUN

61
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:07,725
Is Ms. Hong coming?

62
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:10,269
I'm sure everyone's dying to see her.

63
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:19,987
Oh, wow! She's here!

64
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:25,200
Over here, Ms. Hong!

65
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:35,878
Congratulations.

66
00:05:36,754 --> 00:05:37,755
Taera.

67
00:05:38,756 --> 00:05:39,798
I won the election.

68
00:05:55,314 --> 00:05:56,565
You must be very pleased.

69
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,235
There's a fire at Mokeum Temple?

70
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,946
They're containing it now.

71
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,864
There's a fire. What's happening?

72
00:06:03,948 --> 00:06:06,241
- Was anyone hurt?
- We're checking now.

73
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:08,118
There's a fire at Mokeum Temple?

74
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:10,120
They're containing the fire now.

75
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:11,538
What's this all of a sudden?

76
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:13,707
How big was the fire?

77
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:28,472
<i>What?</i>

78
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:29,682
<i>A bomb?</i>

79
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:34,436
The doors are all locked.
They blocked the exits.

80
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,980
What?

81
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:38,315
There's an emergency exit. Follow me.

82
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:48,409
<i>Hajun.</i>

83
00:06:48,993 --> 00:06:51,578
You have to survive, so we can meet again.

84
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:55,124
Of course. Don't worry.

85
00:06:57,001 --> 00:06:58,794
But promise me one thing.

86
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:02,715
<i>Never give up on your life for revenge.</i>

87
00:07:04,008 --> 00:07:05,759
Stop living as Hong Taera.

88
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:07,886
Live happily as Mun Hagyeong,

89
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:10,389
no matter what happens to me.

90
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:13,559
Why would you say that?

91
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:16,854
Promise me that you'll do as I ask.

92
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:22,860
<i>Hajun!</i>

93
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,695
Hajun!

94
00:07:32,036 --> 00:07:33,120
<i>I'll keep my promise.</i>

95
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:39,501
<i>Watch over me,</i>
<i>and see how I destroy Pyo Jaehyun, Hajun.</i>

96
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:58,604
The Presidential Security Service
will protect you and your family

97
00:07:58,687 --> 00:07:59,813
until the inauguration.

98
00:07:59,897 --> 00:08:02,024
All personnel have been deployed.

99
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:05,277
We'll handle security
for your itinerary, personal and public.

100
00:08:05,361 --> 00:08:06,528
That's reassuring.

101
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:08,489
I'm counting on you.

102
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:12,284
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

103
00:08:13,953 --> 00:08:16,038
What is your first official schedule?

104
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:18,374
Let's visit the fire scene
at Mokeum Temple.

105
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:20,417
Yes, sir.

106
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,464
<i>President-elect Pyo's first official visit</i>

107
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:28,801
<i>will be at the fire scene</i>
<i>at Mokeum Temple.</i>

108
00:08:29,385 --> 00:08:32,554
<i>The exact number of casualties</i>
<i>has yet to be confirmed.</i>

109
00:08:32,638 --> 00:08:34,515
<i>To determine the cause of the fire,</i>

110
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:38,143
<i>the police, CSI,</i>
<i>the Korea Electrical Safety Corporation,</i>

111
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:39,770
<i>and the Fire Department,</i>

112
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:42,231
<i>have begun their joint investigation</i>
<i>on the scene.</i>

113
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:45,734
What caused the accident?

114
00:08:45,818 --> 00:08:48,112
It seems explosives
were set off at this lab.

115
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:50,322
We're still analyzing the details,

116
00:08:50,406 --> 00:08:52,992
including what experiments were done here.

117
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:55,577
Have you identified all the victims?

118
00:08:56,495 --> 00:08:58,664
The bodies were damaged
due to the explosion,

119
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:00,291
so it'll take some time.

120
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:08,132
First, I offer my condolences
to the victims of this tragic incident.

121
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:12,761
As to why there was a research lab here
and what experiments were being conducted,

122
00:09:12,845 --> 00:09:15,431
the truth must be clearly revealed.

123
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:19,935
Also, concerning the victims'
funeral procedures and compensation,

124
00:09:20,728 --> 00:09:24,398
I'll do my best as the president-elect
to attend to it with the transition team.

125
00:09:25,816 --> 00:09:27,651
MOKEUM TEMPLE FIRE SITE
COMMAND HEADQUARTERS

126
00:09:27,735 --> 00:09:29,862
Thank you for your hard work.
Have some of this.

127
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:31,238
Thank you.

128
00:09:32,156 --> 00:09:35,784
Is there any way I can check
the identity of the bodies?

129
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:38,537
Due to the blast, we haven't found
any bodies that were whole.

130
00:09:38,621 --> 00:09:40,039
They'll be hard to identify.

131
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:41,749
There you are.

132
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:46,420
I was wondering
if I could help with anything.

133
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:49,757
- Hello, sir.
- Hello. Thank you for your hard work.

134
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,759
I don't see a memorial
for the victims here.

135
00:09:51,842 --> 00:09:54,845
Would it be all right
if I made one for you?

136
00:09:54,929 --> 00:09:56,931
Oh, thank you.
Thank you, ma'am.

137
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,896
Ms. Ko,
I haven't accepted your resignation.

138
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:05,981
I need you back at work.

139
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:11,028
I clearly expressed
my intention to resign.

140
00:10:13,322 --> 00:10:16,116
I know you're feeling uneasy
due to recent family issues.

141
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:21,580
But your confrontation with Chairman Jang
has reached ten million views now.

142
00:10:23,207 --> 00:10:26,919
Message boards on our website are
exploding because of your fan base.

143
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:30,589
"Do not shun the victim.
Bring her back immediately."

144
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:34,009
"Do you want to lose a real journalist?"

145
00:10:34,093 --> 00:10:36,428
We get tens of thousands of calls a day.

146
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:40,015
Where else can the face of YBC go?

147
00:10:40,766 --> 00:10:42,893
You may as well dedicate your life there.

148
00:10:42,977 --> 00:10:44,436
I won't tell you again.

149
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:48,983
Help me out here, Ms. Ko. Come on. Huh?

150
00:10:53,696 --> 00:10:56,824
Oh, great. I'll see you at the office.

151
00:10:56,907 --> 00:10:58,117
Okay? Don't see me out.

152
00:10:59,118 --> 00:11:01,161
Stop-- Stay there! I'll get going.

153
00:11:07,418 --> 00:11:09,253
Hey, did you find anything?

154
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:13,215
The files are meticulously fabricated
to frame Dojin for misappropriation.

155
00:11:13,299 --> 00:11:14,550
It'll be hard to discredit.

156
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:17,803
The Kumjo Group executives
are avoiding my calls too.

157
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:19,888
I reckon they've been compromised.

158
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:21,056
What do you mean?

159
00:11:21,557 --> 00:11:22,766
<i>Didn't you hear?</i>

160
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:25,644
<i>Your mother-in-law is to become</i>
<i>the acting chairwoman today.</i>

161
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:31,108
I believe you're all still in shock.

162
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,237
When I found out
about Chairman Jang's crimes,

163
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:40,034
I too wanted to end his life by my hand.

164
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:42,077
- We understand.
- Yes, we do.

165
00:11:42,161 --> 00:11:46,582
Kumjo Group was founded
upon the company that my father built:

166
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:47,708
Joseong Foods.

167
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:53,422
Therefore, I can never give up Kumjo.

168
00:11:54,256 --> 00:11:55,257
Of course,

169
00:11:55,341 --> 00:11:57,760
I stepped away from company management
a long time ago.

170
00:11:57,843 --> 00:11:59,637
It'll be hard to put your trust in me.

171
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,430
So instead of trusting me,

172
00:12:02,181 --> 00:12:03,682
trust yourselves.

173
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:06,602
Please help me to rebuild

174
00:12:07,311 --> 00:12:10,022
the Kumjo you built.

175
00:12:10,648 --> 00:12:14,151
Please protect the hundreds of thousands
whose lives depend on Kumjo.

176
00:12:15,194 --> 00:12:16,445
I beg you to consider it.

177
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:25,788
What about Kyojin?

178
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:27,957
I found his departure records to the US.

179
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,041
The US?

180
00:12:29,667 --> 00:12:32,962
Contact all our US offices.
Tell them to find Kyojin.

181
00:12:33,045 --> 00:12:34,046
Yes, ma'am.

182
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:36,840
Before those snakes
start getting funny ideas,

183
00:12:36,924 --> 00:12:39,134
we need to find him
to make him the chairman.

184
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:48,811
You've shown your true colors, Mother.

185
00:12:49,645 --> 00:12:50,854
What do you mean?

186
00:12:51,897 --> 00:12:53,065
You wanted Kumjo,

187
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:55,609
so you framed Dojin
for something he didn't do, no?

188
00:12:56,193 --> 00:12:58,529
Your concerns for me and Leo,
was it all an act?

189
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:00,197
Did you deceive all of us?

190
00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:04,076
Your sentimental view of the world

191
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:06,078
is why your revenge took so long.

192
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:07,788
Let's think rationally here.

193
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:10,874
Once you divorce Dojin,
we're strangers anyway.

194
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:14,253
If you want what's best for Leo,
shouldn't you humble yourself before me?

195
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:18,173
Dojin must've been so lonely
all this time.

196
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:21,969
And he tried so hard to be loved
by a mother like you.

197
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:24,555
I pity that poor man so much.

198
00:13:30,311 --> 00:13:31,437
Don't tell me…

199
00:13:32,104 --> 00:13:33,814
Are you actually worried about Dojin?

200
00:13:34,607 --> 00:13:36,692
Knowing what your father-in-law did?

201
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:40,487
- Do you actually love him?
- Mother.

202
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:46,994
Now I don't have to feel guilty
for marrying the two of you.

203
00:13:48,037 --> 00:13:49,371
What does that mean?

204
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:52,499
When Dojin told us he wanted to marry you,

205
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,793
I gladly gave my approval
for Kumjo's sake.

206
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:58,005
I thought it would be
an effective shield for us.

207
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:03,719
But now you're acting
like he's the love of your life.

208
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:07,181
I've no reason to feel guilty anymore.

209
00:14:07,264 --> 00:14:09,516
What are you doing all this for?

210
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,727
Your family and your children
are all gone.

211
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:14,104
You're all alone now.

212
00:14:14,939 --> 00:14:15,940
What?

213
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:20,861
I guess I'm not as miserable as you.
At least I've someone to protect.

214
00:14:31,914 --> 00:14:32,915
Look.

215
00:14:36,043 --> 00:14:37,920
Name your price for a phone call.

216
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:48,430
Mr. Prosecutor, this is Jang Kummo.

217
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:52,226
I thought I might give you
the evidence you've been looking for.

218
00:14:53,602 --> 00:14:56,313
MOKEUM TEMPLE FIRE
MAY ALL VICTIMS REST IN PEACE

219
00:15:07,116 --> 00:15:09,702
<i>I promised</i>
<i>I'd never leave you alone again…</i>

220
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,914
<i>but I failed to protect you.</i>

221
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:16,667
<i>I'm sorry, Hajun.</i>

222
00:15:18,294 --> 00:15:19,295
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

223
00:15:27,553 --> 00:15:29,805
<i>Mokeum Temple</i>
<i>won't catch up to us, will it?</i>

224
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:31,890
<i>What if they find evidence</i>
<i>of your involvement?</i>

225
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:33,392
<i>That won't happen.</i>

226
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:37,104
<i>How would they when all evidence</i>
<i>and samples have been burned?</i>

227
00:15:37,646 --> 00:15:40,899
<i>Even if there's a problem,</i>
<i>Min Younghwee will take the fall.</i>

228
00:15:40,983 --> 00:15:44,987
Ms. Min is the one who donated
the underground space anyway.

229
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:47,239
Wait a minute.

230
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:50,701
Was it all a calculated move
when you got her involved?

231
00:15:56,707 --> 00:15:58,375
You did well this time.

232
00:15:59,043 --> 00:16:00,586
I'll give this to you as promised.

233
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:02,880
The off-roading accident recordings.

234
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:03,964
The original files.

235
00:16:05,424 --> 00:16:07,343
<i>You sure these are the original files?</i>

236
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:09,803
<i>Kyojin's dead.</i>
<i>What use would I have for them?</i>

237
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:13,807
Oh, man. Sujeong's gone too.

238
00:16:13,891 --> 00:16:16,477
Wow, I can finally breathe again.

239
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:18,771
By the way,

240
00:16:19,271 --> 00:16:21,774
I do pity Kyojin for his poor fate.

241
00:16:21,857 --> 00:16:24,985
He struggled so much
to get back on his feet again.

242
00:16:25,069 --> 00:16:26,070
All that for what?

243
00:16:27,363 --> 00:16:30,282
Life is fleeting, isn't it?

244
00:16:30,366 --> 00:16:31,492
Watch your mouth.

245
00:16:31,575 --> 00:16:33,869
Ms. Min can never know her son is dead.

246
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:37,164
We cooked up his travel records,
so how'd she know?

247
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:39,750
She'll think he fled
to get the hell away from her.

248
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:42,419
<i>Oh, right. By the way.</i>

249
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,090
<i>What about that kid?</i>
<i>Why'd you make him one of your samples?</i>

250
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:49,260
I mean-- Shit. What was the prick's name?

251
00:16:49,343 --> 00:16:52,012
Taera's bodyguard? Pilseung, that's right.

252
00:16:52,513 --> 00:16:54,556
He was a nuisance in many ways.

253
00:16:55,266 --> 00:16:57,476
And I needed a young, healthy sample.

254
00:16:58,644 --> 00:17:01,522
<i>Here's a list of our new samples.</i>

255
00:17:01,605 --> 00:17:03,649
<i>It's about time we set up a new lab.</i>

256
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:07,319
Yes, sir. Mr. President.

257
00:17:10,656 --> 00:17:11,657
Hey.

258
00:17:12,408 --> 00:17:16,453
Does this mean
Dojin's going to prison now?

259
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:20,374
We need a hostage
to render Ko Haesoo helpless.

260
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:26,547
Damn it!
Hey, seriously, I miss Dojin for real.

261
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:27,840
He was a nice guy.

262
00:17:31,844 --> 00:17:32,845
<i>My goodness.</i>

263
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:40,185
<i>Fine, laugh all you want</i>

264
00:17:41,478 --> 00:17:44,523
<i>I'll lead you to the most agonizing hell.</i>

265
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:04,335
Am I being transferred to the prosecution?

266
00:18:08,672 --> 00:18:09,757
Haesoo?

267
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:12,593
You'll be investigated without detention.

268
00:18:13,469 --> 00:18:15,888
Your father handed over to the prosecution

269
00:18:15,971 --> 00:18:18,807
all other shell company files
under Jake Jang's name.

270
00:18:19,892 --> 00:18:21,101
To save you.

271
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:42,665
Why have you come?

272
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:46,043
Didn't you lock up your own father
only a while ago?

273
00:18:48,254 --> 00:18:49,880
If you were going to resent me,

274
00:18:50,631 --> 00:18:52,466
why provide proof to the prosecution?

275
00:18:53,092 --> 00:18:54,385
You're right!

276
00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:56,553
I do resent you a lot.

277
00:18:57,721 --> 00:18:59,974
Wearing prison uniform at this age,

278
00:19:00,057 --> 00:19:03,060
eating cold food on the cold floor.

279
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:05,396
It gets me all riled up to the core!

280
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:08,565
The bastard I call my son
stabs me in the back

281
00:19:08,649 --> 00:19:10,818
so I can suffer at my old age.

282
00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:14,113
I wish I could die right now! So what?

283
00:19:17,116 --> 00:19:18,117
Father…

284
00:19:18,742 --> 00:19:20,911
Is it so hard for you to apologize?

285
00:19:24,248 --> 00:19:27,751
It's your sin. This is all your doing.

286
00:19:32,715 --> 00:19:33,716
You're right.

287
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:38,512
This is the mess I created
all because of my own idiocy.

288
00:19:40,681 --> 00:19:42,891
It's all my fault.

289
00:19:46,562 --> 00:19:48,355
Did Taesun really say that?

290
00:19:48,439 --> 00:19:49,440
15 YEARS AGO

291
00:19:49,523 --> 00:19:52,359
He dares to investigate Kumjo?

292
00:19:53,235 --> 00:19:56,530
He's lost his mind,
now that he's wielding power, huh?

293
00:19:56,614 --> 00:20:00,492
The prosecution has never dared
to probe Kumjo!

294
00:20:01,035 --> 00:20:02,369
I'll try to persuade him.

295
00:20:03,662 --> 00:20:05,456
I've known Taesun for 30 years.

296
00:20:06,415 --> 00:20:07,708
He'll listen to me.

297
00:20:09,335 --> 00:20:12,004
Wait. Don't you know your friend at all?

298
00:20:12,087 --> 00:20:15,299
Ko Taesun would never give an inch.

299
00:20:16,008 --> 00:20:18,385
If I gave the chairman seat
to a nobody like you,

300
00:20:18,469 --> 00:20:20,512
the least you can do is protect it.

301
00:20:21,013 --> 00:20:24,224
Are you going to just watch
my father's accomplishments collapse?

302
00:20:25,935 --> 00:20:28,604
I'll do what I can
to hold off the investigation.

303
00:20:33,776 --> 00:20:35,486
Get rid of Ko Taesun.

304
00:20:39,823 --> 00:20:40,824
What?

305
00:20:41,367 --> 00:20:43,577
No matter how much he does us wrong,

306
00:20:43,661 --> 00:20:45,329
he is my friend!

307
00:20:50,542 --> 00:20:52,628
Did you just raise your voice at me,
honey?

308
00:20:53,629 --> 00:20:57,007
You said you'd serve obediently
like a loyal dog.

309
00:20:58,092 --> 00:21:00,886
You chose to be of service to me,
didn't you?

310
00:21:03,973 --> 00:21:06,642
What's the point of keeping
a guard dog alive,

311
00:21:07,518 --> 00:21:09,728
if he can't protect his own home?

312
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:21,991
How?

313
00:21:22,491 --> 00:21:24,493
How can a man be so cruel?

314
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:26,870
You're going to blame Mother?

315
00:21:26,954 --> 00:21:28,664
No, you have no such right.

316
00:21:28,747 --> 00:21:30,874
The decision ultimately was down to you.

317
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:40,467
Pay the price for what you did to Haesoo
before you even think about getting out.

318
00:21:56,567 --> 00:21:58,652
I'm sorry, Dojin.

319
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:19,006
Don't you see that's why
you're always a step behind him?

320
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:22,092
Dojin is the one
who always takes care of things.

321
00:22:22,176 --> 00:22:23,594
You're doing well.

322
00:22:24,637 --> 00:22:27,640
- Come visit Grandma again.
- Okay.

323
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,154
I no longer have…

324
00:22:43,447 --> 00:22:45,699
a mother anymore.

325
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:51,622
<i>Dojin was released?</i>

326
00:22:52,414 --> 00:22:55,876
It seems your husband owned
several other shell companies.

327
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:59,755
He had all related documents stored
in a private safe at Jongno Bank.

328
00:23:00,422 --> 00:23:02,841
He had a private safe we weren't aware of?

329
00:23:03,842 --> 00:23:07,554
Apologies, I didn't think to search
for an account in Leo's name.

330
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,017
Seems he's forgotten his place.

331
00:23:12,101 --> 00:23:14,520
He'd only been concerned
about his own bloodline.

332
00:23:15,604 --> 00:23:18,732
Your red-eye flight to New York
has been booked.

333
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:24,280
Yes, find Kyojin first.
That's our priority.

334
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,576

<i>by Min Younghwee of Kumjo.</i>

349
00:24:04,903 --> 00:24:09,533
There are speculations that Kumjo Group
was involved with this secret lab.

350
00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:21,670
You said everything would be fine.

351
00:24:21,754 --> 00:24:24,673
You said not to worry,
that you'd end it as a simple fire.

352
00:24:25,299 --> 00:24:26,800
How dare you get Kumjo involved.

353
00:24:26,884 --> 00:24:28,969
What makes you think
I won't take care of it?

354
00:24:29,053 --> 00:24:30,512
I survive only if you do.

355
00:24:31,138 --> 00:24:34,558
It'll be resolved soon,
so don't ever rush over here again.

356
00:24:34,642 --> 00:24:37,645
Put on a brave face and stay calm
as the elder in this situation.

357
00:24:39,605 --> 00:24:41,732
The fact that Kummo released Dojin

358
00:24:42,483 --> 00:24:45,444
means he hasn't given up on Kumjo yet.

359
00:24:46,028 --> 00:24:48,155
Say Kumjo doesn't go to my son Kyojin.

360
00:24:48,238 --> 00:24:52,117
Then, our deal's over.
You know that, right?

361
00:24:52,201 --> 00:24:53,577
Dojin was released?

362
00:24:54,787 --> 00:24:55,871
You didn't know?

363
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:59,708
How can you be so ill-informed
when you're the president-elect!

364
00:25:17,268 --> 00:25:18,894
What is it, Ms. Hong?

365
00:25:18,978 --> 00:25:20,271
You have to see this.

Why-- Why do you have this?

368
00:25:32,741 --> 00:25:34,618
Kyojin's departure record is false.

369
00:25:35,202 --> 00:25:36,620
Jaehyun fabricated it.

370
00:25:37,413 --> 00:25:38,414
What?

371
00:25:38,497 --> 00:25:40,916
Kyojin was at the fire scene
of Mokeum Temple.

372
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,545
To be exact,
inside the secret lab that exploded.

373
00:25:44,628 --> 00:25:46,547
What the hell are you blabbing about?

374
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:48,882
Are you saying something happened to him?

375
00:25:49,633 --> 00:25:52,136
That's for you to find out for yourself.

376
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:55,306
You'll soon find out
whether I'm telling the truth or not.

Maybe Sujeong is alive.

383

It's not her.

She was as good as dead
when we brought her in.

385

What about Kyojin?

386
00:26:28,088 --> 00:26:30,341
It makes no sense.
I designed it like a fortress.

387

So newcomers can never escape!

388

389
00:26:37,181 --> 00:26:38,724
Only the two of us knew.

390
00:26:40,351 --> 00:26:41,352
Hey, damn it.

391
00:26:42,478 --> 00:26:46,649
Sujeong could've gotten him out

I sent Mr. Jo, so let's wait.

397
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:06,877
What? You gonna get rid of her? Huh?

398

Oh, no. What's up?

409
00:28:28,918 --> 00:28:30,252
I put Jiu to bed,

410
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:32,296
so I wanted to have
a glass of wine with you.

411
00:28:33,631 --> 00:28:35,299
Shall we? Let's do that.

412
00:28:39,511 --> 00:28:42,181
Uh. Ms. Min came because of Dojin, right?

413
00:28:42,723 --> 00:28:45,184
If there's anything you can do to help,
please do.

414
00:28:45,893 --> 00:28:48,687
I wouldn't dare disobey you.
I'll do as you say.

00:30:38,909 --> 00:30:41,578
I checked all the surveillance footage
at the airport,

423
00:30:42,329 --> 00:30:44,331
but I couldn't find him.

424
00:30:44,831 --> 00:30:47,584
Kyojin's car was last found

425
00:30:48,376 --> 00:30:50,670
near Mokeum Temple.

426
00:30:50,754 --> 00:30:52,631
He probably turned off his cell phone.

427
00:30:53,256 --> 00:30:56,176
Kyojin was at the secret lab that day.

428
00:31:01,556 --> 00:31:03,058
I have to show you one more thing.

429
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:17,364
Was it-- Was it really him?
The one who tried to kill my son?

430
00:31:17,447 --> 00:31:19,699
Jaehyun knew
who the culprit was from the beginning.

431
00:31:21,535 --> 00:31:23,912
He also aided Sungchan
in the temple bombing.

432
00:31:24,538 --> 00:31:25,997
He killed Kyojin twice.

433
00:31:26,081 --> 00:31:28,792
No way! Kyojin didn't die.

434
00:31:29,459 --> 00:31:31,336
You know what I did to revive him?

435
00:31:31,419 --> 00:31:33,713
How would a mother not know
when her son is dead?

436
00:31:33,797 --> 00:31:36,091
No way. I can't believe you.
He's not dead!

437
00:31:38,635 --> 00:31:40,095
<i>Hey, wait.</i>

<i>You're going to blow this place up?</i>

439
00:31:42,389 --> 00:31:43,974
<i>What about the subjects here?</i>

440
00:31:44,057 --> 00:31:45,350
<i>They'll disappear</i>

441
00:31:46,017 --> 00:31:48,228
<i>along with Jang Kyojin</i>

442
00:31:48,311 --> 00:31:49,688
<i>forever.</i>

443
00:31:54,568 --> 00:31:55,694
Kyojin,

444
00:31:57,362 --> 00:31:58,947
my brother, and Sujeong.

445
00:32:00,657 --> 00:32:02,284
They were all killed by Jaehyun.

446
00:32:02,367 --> 00:32:03,743
Do you still not believe me?

447
00:32:05,954 --> 00:32:07,164
This is all your fault.

448
00:32:07,873 --> 00:32:09,875
If Kyojin hadn't gotten involved with you,

449
00:32:09,958 --> 00:32:11,460
this wouldn't have happened.

450
00:32:11,543 --> 00:32:13,879
He would've inherited Kumjo
without any trouble!

451
00:32:13,962 --> 00:32:14,963
No.

452
00:32:15,755 --> 00:32:19,301
You're the one who built the secret lab
by joining forces with Jaehyun.

453
00:32:20,218 --> 00:32:21,219
You're the one

454
00:32:22,095 --> 00:32:23,346
who killed Kyojin.

455
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:25,807
No, it's a lie! He's not dead!

456
00:32:25,891 --> 00:32:28,518
This can't be! No, no, no!

457
00:32:28,602 --> 00:32:29,811
- Ma'am.
- No!

458
00:32:30,687 --> 00:32:32,314
Get rid of Jaehyun's slush fund.

459
00:32:33,231 --> 00:32:34,816
That's the only thing you can do

460
00:32:35,317 --> 00:32:37,235
for your late son Kyojin.

00:32:57,005 --> 00:32:58,006

463
00:32:58,089 --> 00:32:59,966
How dare you come here?

464
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:02,594
Ms. Eun! Ms. Eun!

465
00:33:02,677 --> 00:33:05,931
You're the one who made Haesoo live
in misery for so long,

466
00:33:06,014 --> 00:33:09,184
you never treated me like a son,

467
00:33:09,267 --> 00:33:11,853
and you abandoned my father
so heartlessly.

468
00:33:12,896 --> 00:33:15,857
All that to satisfy your greedy ambition
to have Kyojin take over Kumjo.

469
00:33:15,941 --> 00:33:16,942
But unfortunately,

470
00:33:17,651 --> 00:33:18,860
he's no longer with us.

471
00:33:18,944 --> 00:33:21,029
Shut up!

472
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:25,826
I'll show you what becomes of those
who work with Jaehyun.

473
00:33:41,508 --> 00:33:43,927
I found Jaehyun's
slush fund ledger, Taera.

474
00:34:07,492 --> 00:34:08,535
Honey.

475
00:34:09,035 --> 00:34:10,036
Are you awake?

476
00:34:10,912 --> 00:34:12,914
I think you were pretty exhausted.

477
00:34:12,998 --> 00:34:16,334
I guess so.
I must've been pretty tired.

478
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,630
You seem energized today.

479
00:34:20,714 --> 00:34:24,050
Yes, I went to the flower market
early in the morning.

480
00:34:25,385 --> 00:34:27,679
I want to send them
to the transition team today.

481
00:34:29,181 --> 00:34:32,726
I couldn't sleep because I was so excited
about the ceremony.

482
00:34:34,644 --> 00:34:35,645
Go wash up.

483
00:34:39,149 --> 00:34:40,358
Okay.

484
00:34:49,951 --> 00:34:51,369
BEST DAD AWARD

485
00:34:51,453 --> 00:34:53,663
It's an award for
the best dad in the world.

486
00:34:53,747 --> 00:34:55,248
I give you this award

487
00:34:55,332 --> 00:34:58,543
for being the coolest dad
not just in Korea but the whole world.

488
00:34:58,627 --> 00:35:02,005
You have to wear it every day, okay?

489
00:35:03,757 --> 00:35:04,883
I'll give you an award

490
00:35:04,966 --> 00:35:07,385
for being the best daughter in the world.

491
00:35:07,469 --> 00:35:09,471
Think carefully about what you want, okay?

492
00:35:10,764 --> 00:35:12,015
See you at the ceremony.

493
00:35:12,098 --> 00:35:14,184
I might be a little late.

494
00:35:14,267 --> 00:35:16,853
I have a lot to do before we move
into our new home.

495
00:35:16,937 --> 00:35:19,606
It's a piece of cake for you.
You're an expert at it.

496
00:35:19,689 --> 00:35:22,150
Take it easy. Don't wear yourself out.

497
00:35:22,234 --> 00:35:25,028
You'll need a lot of energy today.
It's an important day.

498
00:35:26,279 --> 00:35:28,240
Okay. See you later.

499
00:35:29,032 --> 00:35:30,117
See you later, Jiu.

500
00:35:44,381 --> 00:35:45,423
<i>Hello?</i>

501
00:35:45,507 --> 00:35:47,175
Why haven't you called back?

502
00:35:48,301 --> 00:35:49,302
How did it go?

503
00:35:49,886 --> 00:35:50,971
What about the informant?

504
00:35:51,054 --> 00:35:53,223
<i>We're tailing Ko Haesoo.</i>

505
00:35:53,306 --> 00:35:55,684
But we don't see any movements so far.

506
00:35:55,767 --> 00:35:58,395
I'll call you
when anything fishy comes up.

507
00:36:03,525 --> 00:36:07,112
What?
Are you going to kill the president-elect?

508
00:36:07,988 --> 00:36:11,908
No matter how hard you try,
there's no way you can stop him!

509
00:36:11,992 --> 00:36:13,285
Do you know that?

510
00:36:14,035 --> 00:36:15,078
No.

511
00:36:15,162 --> 00:36:17,956
It's over for Jaehyun,
to whom you were so loyal.

512
00:36:23,044 --> 00:36:24,963
Congratulations on the inauguration.

513
00:36:25,046 --> 00:36:27,048
Any comment on the new administration?

514
00:36:27,132 --> 00:36:28,758
Please say a few words.

515
00:36:28,842 --> 00:36:30,802
Any comment?
What can you tell us?

516
00:36:30,886 --> 00:36:32,220
- Could you comment?
- Anything?

517
00:36:33,472 --> 00:36:35,056
A comment, please!

518
00:36:47,027 --> 00:36:48,028
<i>Hey, Jaehyun.</i>

519
00:36:48,737 --> 00:36:50,447
You've already arrived?

520
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:53,492
Damn it. Listen.

521
00:36:53,575 --> 00:36:56,536
I never knew CEOs had
so much paperwork to do.

522
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,288
Okay, I'll be right there.

523
00:36:58,371 --> 00:36:59,372
Okay.

524
00:37:07,672 --> 00:37:09,007
Ms. Min.

525
00:37:10,008 --> 00:37:11,718
What brings you here?

526
00:37:13,553 --> 00:37:16,765
Are you going somewhere?

527
00:37:16,848 --> 00:37:21,186
Today is Jaehyun's inauguration ceremony.

528
00:37:21,686 --> 00:37:24,815
But you're not allowed in here.

529
00:37:28,318 --> 00:37:30,487
You must be reaping a lot of benefits

530
00:37:30,987 --> 00:37:34,241
by siding with him.

531
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:36,827
You're not even worthy

532
00:37:37,327 --> 00:37:40,997
of being the CEO of Hatch
and part of the transition team.

533
00:37:42,415 --> 00:37:43,875
Is this why

534
00:37:44,709 --> 00:37:46,795
you have to side with the right people?

535
00:37:46,878 --> 00:37:48,505
Of course.

536
00:37:48,588 --> 00:37:51,424
Because you sided with Jaehyun,

537
00:37:51,508 --> 00:37:53,552
you got Kumjo Group.

538
00:37:53,635 --> 00:37:55,595
Before that, you were just a housewife.

539
00:38:00,892 --> 00:38:02,060
Shit!

540
00:38:02,144 --> 00:38:03,562
Wait, that's--

541
00:38:03,645 --> 00:38:06,064
What do you think you're doing?

542
00:38:06,148 --> 00:38:09,985
Was my son's life
the price you paid for this job?

543
00:38:10,068 --> 00:38:12,279
Did you think I'd let you
get away with this?

544
00:38:15,407 --> 00:38:16,825
Have you gone senile?

545
00:38:16,908 --> 00:38:18,326
Who killed whom?

546
00:38:19,286 --> 00:38:21,037
You shameless bastard.

547
00:38:21,705 --> 00:38:24,791
How dare you frame Dojin and deceive me!

548
00:38:28,336 --> 00:38:29,963
What did you do with my son?

549
00:38:30,046 --> 00:38:32,799
You're the one who lured him
into Mokeum Temple, aren't you?

550
00:38:32,883 --> 00:38:34,926
By fabricating his travel records,

551
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:38,638
did you think you could keep
his death a secret forever?

552
00:38:38,722 --> 00:38:40,515
How dare you, you little shit?

553
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:44,102
How dare you kill Kyojin twice?

554
00:38:44,186 --> 00:38:45,187
Shit.

555
00:38:46,605 --> 00:38:47,606
Damn it!

556
00:38:48,273 --> 00:38:49,483
Listen here.

557
00:38:49,566 --> 00:38:52,903
You should've stopped your sons
from being nuisances.

558
00:38:52,986 --> 00:38:54,738
Why put me in such a foul mood?

559
00:38:55,655 --> 00:38:56,948
Actually,

560
00:38:57,032 --> 00:39:00,285
you should've let him die seven years ago.

561
00:39:00,368 --> 00:39:03,246
Why would you do all that shit
to save him?

562
00:39:03,747 --> 00:39:05,457
He died anyway, didn't he?

563
00:39:11,671 --> 00:39:13,590
Do you have evidence

564
00:39:13,673 --> 00:39:15,717
that your son died at Mokeum Temple?

565
00:39:15,801 --> 00:39:18,178
I bet you can't even prove
that we killed him.

566
00:39:19,513 --> 00:39:20,555
Ms. Min.

567
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:26,770
Jaehyun is the president now
and I am Jaehyun's closest partner.

568
00:39:27,562 --> 00:39:30,398
You're no match for me.

569
00:39:30,482 --> 00:39:32,526
If you so desire,

570
00:39:32,609 --> 00:39:35,278
how about I dig up dirt about Kumjo Group

571
00:39:35,362 --> 00:39:36,780
and teach you a lesson?

572
00:39:55,882 --> 00:39:56,883
Do I…

573
00:39:58,844 --> 00:40:01,054
Do I look like I have the will to live on?

574
00:40:06,852 --> 00:40:08,895
You really have gone senile.

575
00:40:08,979 --> 00:40:10,021
Damn it.

576
00:40:11,815 --> 00:40:14,192
Hey, Mr. Ha!

577
00:40:14,693 --> 00:40:15,819
Security!

578
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:17,863
Is anyone out there?

579
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:24,202
Hey! Get rid of this nuisance!

580
00:40:32,961 --> 00:40:34,129
What the hell?

581
00:40:45,223 --> 00:40:46,933
Does it hurt, Sungchan?

582
00:40:48,101 --> 00:40:50,020
My son's pain

583
00:40:50,103 --> 00:40:53,482
would've been a thousand times
greater than yours.

584
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,111
His whole body was on fire.

585
00:40:58,695 --> 00:41:02,783
He would've been in so much pain
that he could barely breathe.

586
00:41:02,866 --> 00:41:04,034
But you…

587
00:41:05,202 --> 00:41:07,120
you call that pain?

588
00:41:15,295 --> 00:41:16,630
Don't worry.

589
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:20,300
I'll go to Jaehyun's inauguration ceremony

590
00:41:20,926 --> 00:41:22,928
on your behalf.

591
00:41:39,027 --> 00:41:43,990
PYO JAEHYUN! NEW ADMINISTRATION
INAUGURATION CEREMONY

592
00:41:44,074 --> 00:41:45,575
- Mr. Han.
- Ah.

593
00:41:46,159 --> 00:41:48,036
Thank you for coming.

594
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:52,165
The president-elect earnestly requested
that you attend.

595
00:41:52,833 --> 00:41:56,128
He thinks of you so highly
that I felt a little envious.

596
00:42:01,424 --> 00:42:03,802
Let bygones be bygones.

597
00:42:03,885 --> 00:42:06,847
I, Han Kyungrok, will always be
where I'm needed.

598
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:09,474
That's my motto in politics.

599
00:42:09,558 --> 00:42:10,934
That's right.

600
00:42:11,017 --> 00:42:14,396
Is the man of the hour not ready yet?

601
00:42:15,021 --> 00:42:17,357
For the new Pyo Administration,

602
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,152
its first project is
the long-awaited science project.

603
00:42:20,235 --> 00:42:23,071
I deeply regret
the Mokeum Temple fire incident,

604
00:42:23,155 --> 00:42:27,242
and I'll take action so human experiments
won't be conducted in secrecy,

605
00:42:27,325 --> 00:42:30,120
but in transparency and within legal--

606
00:42:34,833 --> 00:42:36,668
I don't remember inviting…

607
00:42:38,753 --> 00:42:40,130
you, Ms. Min.

608
00:42:42,132 --> 00:42:45,051
Big celebrations call
for uninvited guests.

609
00:42:45,135 --> 00:42:46,386
Did something happen?

610
00:42:46,928 --> 00:42:48,388
You don't look too well.

611
00:42:49,848 --> 00:42:52,058
I went to see Sungchan.

612
00:42:52,809 --> 00:42:54,144
I had to confirm something.

613
00:42:55,228 --> 00:42:56,354
Confirm what?

614
00:43:02,736 --> 00:43:04,946
<i>Mokeum Temple</i>
<i>won't catch up to us, will it?</i>

615
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:07,324
<i>What if they find evidence</i>
<i>of your involvement--</i>

616
00:43:07,407 --> 00:43:08,658
<i>That won't happen.</i>

617
00:43:08,742 --> 00:43:11,536
<i>How would they when all evidence</i>
<i>and samples have been burned?</i>

618
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:15,165
<i>Even if there's a problem,</i>
<i>Min Younghwee will take the fall.</i>

619
00:43:15,248 --> 00:43:16,875
<i>Ms. Min is the one who donated--</i>

620
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:24,758
You tricked me and said the experiment
was needed to help Kyojin wake up.

621
00:43:25,926 --> 00:43:28,136
Then you conducted
illegal human experiments?

622
00:43:28,678 --> 00:43:32,307
You'd do all the dirty and bloody work,

623
00:43:32,974 --> 00:43:34,893
and you were going to frame me for it?

624
00:43:34,976 --> 00:43:37,229
I only said that
because that bastard Sungchan

625
00:43:37,312 --> 00:43:39,898
realized that you were
in charge of my money.

626
00:43:39,981 --> 00:43:41,566
I had to come up with an excuse.

627
00:43:42,192 --> 00:43:45,278
If people found out about us,
it would cause a commotion.

628
00:43:45,362 --> 00:43:46,780
You know what I mean, right?

629
00:43:47,614 --> 00:43:48,615
Oh.

630
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:52,953
I see. So that's what it was.

631
00:43:58,083 --> 00:43:59,292
But…

632
00:44:00,836 --> 00:44:02,671
why did you kill Kyojin?

633
00:44:03,755 --> 00:44:04,965
What?

634
00:44:06,883 --> 00:44:08,510
Why would Kyojin die?

635
00:44:09,177 --> 00:44:11,263
What on earth are you talking about?

636
00:44:11,346 --> 00:44:12,764
You killed him,

637
00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:17,144
along with the subjects
in your secret lab.

638
00:44:18,061 --> 00:44:19,312
You made Sungchan kill him.

639
00:44:20,772 --> 00:44:22,649
So they would all disappear…

640
00:44:23,275 --> 00:44:26,194
Along with Jang Kyojin forever. Boom!

641
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:36,121
On my way here, I kept thinking

642
00:44:37,038 --> 00:44:38,665
about what I should do with you.

643
00:44:39,499 --> 00:44:42,002
What can I do to avenge my son?

644
00:44:44,087 --> 00:44:46,256
No matter how much I think about it,

645
00:44:46,882 --> 00:44:50,093
there's only one way to avenge Kyojin.

646
00:44:51,219 --> 00:44:52,679
Jaehyun.

647
00:44:54,431 --> 00:44:56,725
You'll have to die in pain
just like Kyojin did.

648
00:44:58,852 --> 00:44:59,853
Have you gone mad?

649
00:44:59,936 --> 00:45:01,980
You want to stab me?
Don't you know who I am?

650
00:45:02,063 --> 00:45:06,026
Think you'll be president
when my son died because of you?

651
00:45:07,652 --> 00:45:08,904
That's just too unfair.

652
00:45:08,987 --> 00:45:11,031
Don't you agree, Jaehyun?

653
00:45:13,116 --> 00:45:15,869
I won't die.
You know what I did to get here?

654
00:45:16,369 --> 00:45:18,079
I won't let anyone get in my way!

655
00:45:22,459 --> 00:45:25,253
If it weren't for my money,
you'd be dead right here, right now!

656
00:45:29,049 --> 00:45:32,010
<i>President-elect Pyo's</i>
<i>New Administration Inauguration Ceremony</i>

657
00:45:32,093 --> 00:45:33,261
<i>will begin soon.</i>

658
00:45:33,929 --> 00:45:37,015
<i>All guests may now enter the hall.</i>

659
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:44,064
Unless you want to join Kyojin,

660
00:45:44,147 --> 00:45:46,691
don't say a word
until the ceremony is over

661
00:45:46,775 --> 00:45:48,735
and stay put, got that?

662
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:12,425
Make sure no one enters the green room.

663
00:46:12,509 --> 00:46:13,510
Yes, sir.

664
00:46:24,563 --> 00:46:27,774
Thank you for waiting. Shall we begin?

665
00:46:45,208 --> 00:46:48,378
<i>If it weren't for my money,</i>
<i>you'd be dead right here, right now!</i>

666
00:46:49,671 --> 00:46:51,798
Why is that…

667
00:46:55,594 --> 00:46:57,262
President-elect Pyo Jaehyun.

668
00:46:57,345 --> 00:47:00,056
Are you the mastermind
behind the establishment

669
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:03,894
of a secret lab below Mokeum Temple
to conduct illegal human experiments?

670
00:47:03,977 --> 00:47:07,647
Did you blow it up to destroy evidence?

671
00:47:13,487 --> 00:47:14,654
No.

672
00:47:15,155 --> 00:47:16,198
That's not true.

673
00:47:16,281 --> 00:47:19,367
Do you admit to using the names
of the test subjects

674
00:47:19,451 --> 00:47:21,453
to set up accounts for a blind trust

675
00:47:21,536 --> 00:47:26,416
for your Hatch shares, so that Ms. Min
of Kumjo can manage your slush funds?

676
00:47:28,043 --> 00:47:29,044
No.

677
00:47:30,712 --> 00:47:31,880
It's all a lie.

678
00:47:32,923 --> 00:47:35,175
No, it's all true.

679
00:47:35,967 --> 00:47:41,181
I've sent you all the evidence you need
to prove that Ko's accusations are true.

680
00:47:44,726 --> 00:47:47,270
- What?
- Is this video evidence?

681
00:47:50,857 --> 00:47:52,818
Take a look at this.

682
00:48:00,909 --> 00:48:04,246
<i>Let's see how much stimuli</i>
<i>your cranial nerves can withstand.</i>

683
00:48:11,336 --> 00:48:13,547
I know that man!

684
00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:15,924
He was Pyo Jaehyun's wife's security!

685
00:48:16,007 --> 00:48:20,345
How could you do such a heinous thing
to a healthy person?

686
00:48:20,428 --> 00:48:22,264
Mr. President-elect, what's going on?

687
00:48:22,347 --> 00:48:23,348
Is this all true?

688
00:48:24,349 --> 00:48:26,143
I said it's not true!

689
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:28,728
It's all a lie!

690
00:48:28,812 --> 00:48:29,938
Trust me.

691
00:48:30,021 --> 00:48:32,315
Trust in me and no one else!

692
00:48:33,692 --> 00:48:37,237
The smart patches released by Hatch
and the research results with Red

693
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:39,739
were all manipulated by Pyo Jaehyun.

694
00:48:39,823 --> 00:48:43,618
Red was killed before the side effects
could kill her first.

695
00:48:43,702 --> 00:48:45,036
And the smart patches failed.

696
00:48:45,996 --> 00:48:50,959
Pyo Jaehyun was putting on a show
to manipulate the stock prices.

697
00:48:51,042 --> 00:48:52,586
Cut the bullshit!

698
00:48:52,669 --> 00:48:53,670
I didn't fail.

699
00:48:53,753 --> 00:48:55,964
My research was perfect.

700
00:48:56,047 --> 00:48:58,884
No, you're a devil
who sacrificed many innocent people

701
00:48:58,967 --> 00:49:01,136
for your worthless cause.

702
00:49:01,219 --> 00:49:04,014
Bastards like you should
never become president!

703
00:49:04,097 --> 00:49:05,265
I am the president!

704
00:49:05,348 --> 00:49:08,185
I'm President Pyo Jaehyun!

705
00:49:08,268 --> 00:49:09,895
- Damn it.
- Honey.

706
00:49:13,648 --> 00:49:15,859
- Taera.
- This isn't you.

707
00:49:16,526 --> 00:49:18,361
I think there's been a misunderstanding.

708
00:49:18,445 --> 00:49:21,031
He would never do such a thing.

709
00:49:21,656 --> 00:49:22,824
Please believe me.

710
00:49:24,493 --> 00:49:27,579
Taera, you trust me, right?
You will trust me, won't you?

711
00:49:30,415 --> 00:49:31,666
Mr. Pyo!

712
00:49:33,376 --> 00:49:36,129
You're under arrest
for arson at Mokeum Temple.

713
00:49:36,713 --> 00:49:38,423
You have the right to remain silent.

714
00:49:38,507 --> 00:49:40,967
You have the right to an attorney.
Anything you say--

715
00:49:41,051 --> 00:49:42,761
What? What's going on?

716
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:45,764
- Turn on the lights!
- What is this?

717
00:49:45,847 --> 00:49:48,850
- Turn on the lights quickly!
- What is this?

718
00:49:48,934 --> 00:49:50,101
- What?
- What's going on?

719
00:49:50,811 --> 00:49:52,229
Where did they go?

720
00:49:52,312 --> 00:49:54,397
Where did Pyo Jaehyun go?

721
00:49:54,481 --> 00:49:55,482
Hey!

722
00:49:55,982 --> 00:49:57,192
Where is he?

723
00:50:01,154 --> 00:50:03,073
Get ready. Taera will be out soon.

724
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:05,992
I believe you. Let's get out of here.

725
00:50:06,493 --> 00:50:07,494
That car.

726
00:50:11,164 --> 00:50:12,374
Get in!

727
00:50:26,388 --> 00:50:27,639
Haesoo.

728
00:50:28,181 --> 00:50:29,391
Taera just took off.

729
00:50:37,149 --> 00:50:38,233
Let go.

730
00:50:38,316 --> 00:50:39,526
Pyo Jaehyun.

731
00:50:39,609 --> 00:50:41,194
I have to kill him myself.

732
00:50:41,903 --> 00:50:44,739
Kyojin's DNA wasn't found
at the fire scene of Mokeum Temple.

733
00:50:47,033 --> 00:50:48,034
What?

734
00:50:48,118 --> 00:50:49,494
You need to get out of there.

735
00:50:49,578 --> 00:50:51,204
The police are looking for you.

736
00:50:51,288 --> 00:50:55,125
If you get caught now,
you will neither find nor meet Kyojin.

737
00:50:56,334 --> 00:50:57,878
My baby is alive.

738
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:01,214
My baby isn't dead.

739
00:51:13,351 --> 00:51:14,895
The police will tail us soon.

740
00:51:14,978 --> 00:51:17,230
Let's keep a low profile with Jiu for now.

741
00:51:17,314 --> 00:51:19,191
I can take care of everything.

742
00:51:19,274 --> 00:51:21,359
I'll prove that
it's all a misunderstanding.

743
00:51:21,443 --> 00:51:22,444
You trust me, right?

744
00:51:23,653 --> 00:51:25,739
Yes. All I need is your trust, Taera.

745
00:51:29,075 --> 00:51:30,076
Taera.

746
00:51:33,330 --> 00:51:34,748
What's wrong, Taera?

747
00:51:34,831 --> 00:51:40,045
The Hong Taera who trusted you and cared
for you, no matter what, is gone now.

748
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:43,089
What are you saying?

749
00:51:43,882 --> 00:51:45,759
How could you kill Hajun?

750
00:51:48,053 --> 00:51:49,429
What?

751
00:51:53,141 --> 00:51:54,267
I remember everything.

752
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:57,646
I never lost my memory
for a single moment.

753
00:51:59,981 --> 00:52:01,149
In order to find Hajun,

754
00:52:01,733 --> 00:52:03,944
I put on this disgusting act
in front of you.

755
00:52:06,613 --> 00:52:07,614
No.

756
00:52:09,533 --> 00:52:11,076
No, this makes no sense.

757
00:52:11,743 --> 00:52:13,245
How could you be so shameless

758
00:52:14,204 --> 00:52:16,039
and ask me to trust you
after killing Hajun?

759
00:52:16,123 --> 00:52:17,249
Misunderstanding?

760
00:52:20,544 --> 00:52:23,380
I will never go back
to being the Hong Taera that you created.

761
00:52:26,508 --> 00:52:30,971
You will never see
Hong Taera or Jiu again.

762
00:52:32,222 --> 00:52:33,223
What did you say?

763
00:52:42,732 --> 00:52:43,733
Shit.

764
00:52:48,613 --> 00:52:49,614
The world…

765
00:52:51,575 --> 00:52:53,785
will remember you as a cruel murderer.

766
00:52:55,745 --> 00:52:56,746
Taera.

767
00:52:58,748 --> 00:53:00,709
How could you do this to me?

768
00:53:02,252 --> 00:53:03,336
How could you?

769
00:53:07,674 --> 00:53:08,675
Congratulations.

770
00:53:11,052 --> 00:53:12,554
You just destroyed the Hong Taera

771
00:53:14,139 --> 00:53:16,141
that you created with your own hands.

772
00:53:18,435 --> 00:53:19,436
What?

773
00:53:43,919 --> 00:53:45,962
The car fell below the bridge.

774
00:53:46,046 --> 00:53:48,340
Call the coast guard
and get the divers ready.

775
00:53:48,423 --> 00:53:51,051
- Yes, sir.
- Backup's on the way.

776
00:53:57,507 --> 00:53:58,508
Taera.

777
00:54:01,761 --> 00:54:02,762
Hey.

778
00:54:22,824 --> 00:54:23,825
Damn it.

779
00:55:06,910 --> 00:55:08,036
Are you awake?

780
00:55:08,745 --> 00:55:09,746
Mr. Pyo.

781
00:55:09,829 --> 00:55:12,332
You're under arrest
for arson at Mokeum Temple.

782
00:55:12,415 --> 00:55:14,501
You have the right to remain silent.

783
00:55:14,584 --> 00:55:18,254
You have the right to an attorney.
Anything you say can and will be used--

784
00:55:18,338 --> 00:55:19,631
Where's Taera?

785
00:55:20,215 --> 00:55:22,300
- Pardon?
- Hong Taera.

786
00:55:23,092 --> 00:55:24,302
Where is she?

787
00:55:24,969 --> 00:55:27,680
- Who is Hong Taera? Do you know?
- I don't know.

788
00:55:28,181 --> 00:55:30,683
- Who is Hong Taera?
- My wife.

789
00:55:31,351 --> 00:55:32,894
Wasn't she brought here with me?

790
00:55:34,395 --> 00:55:37,190
Is she being treated?
Is she gravely injured?

791
00:55:37,273 --> 00:55:39,692
You were alone when we found you.

792
00:55:39,776 --> 00:55:41,611
There was no Hong Taera.

793
00:55:42,612 --> 00:55:44,739
We'll take you
to the station for questioning.

794
00:55:44,823 --> 00:55:46,616
Feel free to call your lawyer.

795
00:55:46,699 --> 00:55:49,327
Where is my wife? Where did you hide her?

796
00:55:49,410 --> 00:55:51,120
Are you working with that bastard Dojin?

00:56:02,048 --> 00:56:04,926
<i>the story behind the Mokeum Temple</i>
<i>bombing was revealed.</i>

801
00:56:05,009 --> 00:56:07,720
<i>Mr. Pyo, who was on the run</i>
<i>after denying the truth,</i>

802
00:56:07,804 --> 00:56:09,806
<i>stole a civilian's car and fled.</i>

803
00:56:09,889 --> 00:56:12,559
<i>After a police pursuit,</i>
<i>he was finally arrested.</i>

804
00:56:13,309 --> 00:56:17,897
As a result, the youngest
and the first unmarried president-elect

805
00:56:17,981 --> 00:56:20,233
for whom the entire nation was rooting,

806
00:56:20,316 --> 00:56:21,317
in an instant--

807
00:56:21,401 --> 00:56:23,236
Unmarried president-elect?

808
00:56:23,319 --> 00:56:25,071
Let's go to the station.

809
00:56:25,155 --> 00:56:26,489
Hold on.

810
00:56:26,573 --> 00:56:28,408
May I stop by my house before we go?

811
00:56:29,117 --> 00:56:30,660
I need to check something.

812
00:56:30,743 --> 00:56:31,828
Please.

813
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:41,421
What?

814
00:56:45,466 --> 00:56:46,467
What's going on?

815
00:56:50,930 --> 00:56:52,098
What the hell happened?

816
00:56:53,766 --> 00:56:54,851
Are we good now?

817
00:56:55,518 --> 00:56:57,228
Stop stalling and let's go.

818
00:56:58,438 --> 00:56:59,439
The photo…

819
00:57:17,624 --> 00:57:18,625
My daughter…

820
00:57:19,501 --> 00:57:20,502
Jiu…

821
00:57:26,007 --> 00:57:27,467
No, it's a lie.

822
00:57:28,843 --> 00:57:30,720
Taera, stop fooling around and come out.

823
00:57:32,722 --> 00:57:35,517
<i>Jaehyun, I'm going to love</i>
<i>no one else until my last breath.</i>

824
00:57:39,145 --> 00:57:41,022
I'm sorry. Please stop this.

825
00:57:43,358 --> 00:57:45,068
No matter what happens,
I will protect you.

826
00:57:45,151 --> 00:57:46,653
Who's going to tuck me in today?

827
00:57:46,736 --> 00:57:49,072
Daddy will! I'll also read you a book.

828
00:57:49,155 --> 00:57:51,282
<i>I'm asking you to stop!</i>

829
00:57:51,366 --> 00:57:53,576
I get it, so stop and come out!

830
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:54,702
Where are you, Taera?

831
00:57:55,203 --> 00:57:56,454
Come back!

832
00:57:56,538 --> 00:57:59,249
Taera, I said I'm sorry! Where are you?

833
00:57:59,332 --> 00:58:00,708
Where on earth are you?

834
00:58:01,459 --> 00:58:03,670
This is wrong! This is wrong!

835
00:58:04,504 --> 00:58:06,339
<i>This is wrong! No.</i>

836
00:58:06,422 --> 00:58:07,507
<i>This is wrong.</i>

837
00:58:10,176 --> 00:58:11,177
<i>Congratulations.</i>

838
00:58:13,179 --> 00:58:14,681
<i>You just destroyed the Hong Taera</i>

839
00:58:16,057 --> 00:58:17,851
that you created with your own hands.

840
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:21,521
This can't be.

841
00:58:25,316 --> 00:58:26,484
No.

842
00:58:26,568 --> 00:58:27,986
This can't be!

843
00:58:33,888 --> 00:58:36,715
PANDORA: BENEATH THE PARADISE

844
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:51,926
BEST DAD AWARD

845
00:58:54,888 --> 00:58:58,600
Where's Taera? Where'd you hide my family?

846
00:58:58,683 --> 00:59:00,935
You've never been married! What family?

847
00:59:01,019 --> 00:59:03,897
She can't just disappear into thin air.
Not if everyone's in on this.

848
00:59:04,856 --> 00:59:06,107
<i>But I'm your husband.</i>

849
00:59:06,191 --> 00:59:09,694
You're doing this on purpose
to punish me, right?

850
00:59:09,777 --> 00:59:12,113
You're creeping me out.
Get out of my sight now!

851
00:59:12,197 --> 00:59:16,034
<i>No matter where you hide,</i>
<i>I will find you, Taera.</i>

852
00:59:16,117 --> 00:59:17,285
Haesoo!

853
00:59:17,368 --> 00:59:18,620
<i>Bring me Hong Taera.</i>

854
00:59:18,703 --> 00:59:20,413
<i>Taera is our only way.</i>

855
00:59:20,497 --> 00:59:22,624
<i>You're my woman.</i>
<i>You're Pyo Jaehyun's woman!</i>

856
00:59:23,113 --> 00:59:29,926
