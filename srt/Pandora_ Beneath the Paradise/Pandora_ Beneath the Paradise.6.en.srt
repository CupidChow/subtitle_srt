PANDORA : BENEATH THE PARADISE

2
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:58,641
EPISODE 6

3
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:14,324
You always stood behind your husband,

4
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:16,743
perhaps to minimize exposure.

5
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:18,620
Can you tell us why?

6
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:21,081
Could it be because
you have a tremendous secret?

7
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:22,165
What's this?

8
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:26,002
-Hey, get in here! Radio the others.
-Ko, the questions are a bit…

9
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,004
-Yes, sir!
-Am I making you uncomfortable?

10
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,215
Think of this as a precursor
of what's to come.

11
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:34,386
After all, there might be things
about your wife you don't know yet.

12
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:38,598
What exactly are you talking about?

13
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:41,434
YBC EXCLUSIVE ELECTION SPECIAL
"WHO ARE YOU"

14
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:47,065
Taera, you know who this is, don't you?

15
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:51,361
Who on earth is she?

16
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,905
The real killer
of the late President Ko Taesun.

17
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,408
This is the assassin who killed my father.

18
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:57,826
-What?
-Really?

19
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:59,494
-What does that mean?
-Is that true?

20
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:01,287
-No way.
-I don't believe it.

21
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,914
She's taking quite a risk.

22
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:04,082
What's she doing?

23
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:06,835
She keeps going off script.

24
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:08,837
She was fine earlier…

25
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:10,839
On that day, 15 years ago,

26
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,550
were you not also at the scene, Ms. Hong?

27
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:16,386
What?

28
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:17,887
The woman in this photo.

29
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:22,350
The suspect who assassinated
the former President Ko.

30
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:25,145
Is this you, Ms. Hong?

31
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,856
What? No way.
This can't be happening.

32
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:34,237
Answer me, Hong Taera.

33
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,742
Was it you who killed my father…

34
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:43,329
on that day, 15 years ago?

35
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,085
Hey, hey, Ms. Ko, are you insane?

36
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,503
-Geez.
-Are you nuts?

37
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:53,423
That's enough, Ms. Ko.

38
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:54,883
What's with the tears?

39
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,217
Are you admitting guilt?

40
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:00,972
Tell me, Hong Taera.

41
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,642
Are you No. 50,
the assassin who shot my father?

42
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:06,811
Answer me!

43
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,980
Is this for real?
What's this about?

44
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:12,067
What are you doing?

45
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,402
-Quickly! Shut it down now!
-Quickly! Shut it--

46
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:29,209
So the little bitch has done it.

47
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:33,171
Let's take a break. Sorry, everyone!

48
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:34,756
-What's going on?
-What happened?

49
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:37,425
Chief-- One moment--
Hey, Ms. Ko--! Sir, wait!

50
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:39,469
Why are you silent?

51
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:42,305
I have proof you forged your identity.

52
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,182
You can't run this time, Taera!

53
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:45,266
I don't intend to.

54
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:47,936
I came here to tell the truth.

55
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,562
That's enough.

56
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:52,148
-What the hell is this?
-You really didn't know?

57
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,526
You didn't know
your wife killed my father?

58
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:58,279
Were you pretending this whole time?
Did you deceive me too?

59
00:03:58,363 --> 00:03:59,781
Calm down, Ko Haesoo!

60
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:01,157
Stop talking nonsense.

61
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,243
Is this why you brought us here? Huh?

62
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,370
Did you not kill my father?

63
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,872
Answer me, Hong Taera!

64
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:11,209
Have you lost your mind? Are you insane?

65
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:13,670
Haesoo's done nothing wrong.

66
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:15,505
Let me talk to her.

67
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,966
Talk about what? Forget it. Let's just go.

68
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,217
I need to talk to her.

69
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,511
Answer me before you go! Hong Taera!

70
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:23,805
Let go!

71
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:29,436
What's happening?

72
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,104
What if his poll drops?

73
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:34,190
Chief.

74
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:41,239
What the hell does that mean?

75
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,533
YBC ELECTION SPECIAL
"WHO ARE YOU"

76
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,452
-Ms. Hong!
-We love you!

77
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,579
-Over here!
-There they are.

78
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:48,705
NO. 1 BRAIN

79
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:51,624
Hong Taera!

80
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:52,917
Hong Taera!

81
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,962
What do you think you're doing?

82
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:57,297
Move it.

83
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,425
Hong Taera and Director Kim Seondeok
killed my father!

84
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,304
Hong Taera is a trained killer
from Hanwool Mental Hospital!

85
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:05,638
-What?
-Has she gone mad?

86
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,640
-Out of my way.
-Stop this please!

87
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,684
-Haesoo, please stop.
-Get off me!

88
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:11,144
-Breaking news.
-Pay attention!

89
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:15,357
Ju, who claimed himself to be
the real assassin of the late President,

90
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,609
was found dead in his home moments ago.

91
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:21,488
Our reporter is live on the scene
to give us further details.

92
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:22,697
Reporter Min Yungi.

93
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:26,868
Ju, who claimed himself to be
the real assassin of the late President,

94
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:29,746
disclosed his location an hour ago,

95
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,749
leaving behind a suicide note
before ending his life.

96
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:35,418
The firearm he used has been confirmed

97
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:39,881
as the same one he used to assassinate
the late president 15 years ago,

98
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:42,300
-adding credibility to his confession.
-Impossible.

99
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,053
-The police are identifying the body…
-You!

100
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:47,055
You shat on the special,

101
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:49,849
and practically yielded our ratings
to our competitors.

102
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:52,268
You've really done it, Ko Haesoo!

103
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:54,270
Lies…

104
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,272
Those are all lies.

105
00:05:57,941 --> 00:05:58,942
Why now?

106
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,361
That's not possible.

107
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:03,488
It's all a lie!

108
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:08,451
The following was written
on the culprit's suicide note:

109
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:12,372
"I've lived with a guilty conscience,
and though I was acting

110
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:16,251
upon someone's orders,
I cannot disclose their identity."

111
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,507
Ko Haesoo's gone insane.

112
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,093
What have you done? Let me go.

113
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:27,804
-Do you see what you've done?
-Please calm down.

114
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,889
-What the hell?
-So she was wrong.

115
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:36,688
Was this your plan
all along? To ruin everything?

116
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,415
Haesoo.

117
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,126
Haesoo, wake up.

118
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:00,420
Haesoo, come on. Haesoo.

119
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:13,099
Let's say she was stressing
over Dojin's affair.

120
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:15,143
But why take it all out on Taera?

121
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:17,687
I'm so disappointed in her.

122
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:22,150
The press is having a field day with this.

123
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,236
I knew something
was going awry half way through.

124
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,073
It was as if Ms. Ko
had already made up her mind.

125
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,784
So she intentionally sent us
a different script,

126
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,119
while she prepared for her own show.

127
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:35,955
Wow, I'm getting goose bumps.
Goodness gracious--

128
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:40,585
Yeah, she can go insane all she wants.
But don't just pick on the wrong person!

129
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:43,922
How spiteful can she be
to just dump it on Ms. Taera Hong.

130
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:46,007
But it is pretty weird.

131
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:50,345
The timing of when the culprit
who'd been sought for so long appears

132
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:52,639
and confesses before he dies?

133
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:04,776
I let it slide with Dojin's incident,
but not this time.

134
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:08,071
-I need to hear what she has to say.
-Honey.

135
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,242
We need to talk.

136
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:17,080
So why are you so protective of her?

137
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,915
This shouldn't be taken lightly.

138
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,167
Jaehyun…

139
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:23,712
Do you really trust me?

140
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:29,426
What if Haesoo's right
and I'm not the woman you think I am?

141
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,594
What will you do then?

142
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:33,346
What are you saying?

143
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,350
Have you remembered something?

144
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:39,602
What is it? Tell me.

145
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:42,313
I need to know, so I can help you.

146
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:49,070
I already told you.
I trust the Hong Taera I know.

147
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:52,365
Whoever you were in the past,
I'm on your side.

148
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,993
No matter what happens,
I will protect you.

149
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,578
With my life.

150
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:16,514
I'm sorry you have to go through this
because of me.

151
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:29,069
Your late sister must've
wanted to hear your voice one last time.

152
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:30,653
NEW VOICEMAIL

153
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,781
It's unfortunate you never picked up.

154
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,959
Taera,

155
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:48,838
the person who gave you your new identity
is your husband, Pyo Jaehyun.

156
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,049
He deceived me too.

157
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:54,177
Don't ever trust him.

158
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,054
You don't know what he's capable of.

159
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:01,726
Jaehyun is trying to get this flash drive
I stole from Sungchan.

160
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,646
If something happens to me,

161
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:06,731
can you…

162
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,570
…give it back to Sungchan?

163
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:23,289
Are you sure nothing was found?

164
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:25,500
Yes.

165
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:29,879
We performed an autopsy as you requested,
but we didn't find metal in her stomach.

166
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,924
Thank you.

167
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:36,845
Keep the autopsy an absolute secret.

168
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,638
Even from my wife.

169
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:40,181
Of course.

170
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:06,041
Seems she ingested it
right before she died.

171
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:07,959
It hadn't reached her stomach.

172
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:12,922
I only did what you asked, but
I'm not sure if I should be doing this.

173
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:16,801
Receiving payment from both of you…

174
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:21,222
If this gets out,
both of us will put you six feet under.

175
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,225
Keep your mouth shut.

176
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:26,603
Confidentiality is everything
to a man like me.

177
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:30,440
We'll have the body moved
to the funeral home without a hitch.

178
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:31,524
Rest assured.

179
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:39,115
HATCH

180
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:57,467
Have some rest. I'll let everyone out.

181
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,515
I won't confront Haesoo, as you asked.

182
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:44,806
Are you okay?

183
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:47,350
What happened?

184
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:49,477
Do you not remember what you did?

185
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:52,480
No, I remember very clearly.

186
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:55,066
I'm not insane.

187
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,111
Everything I said on air is the truth.

188
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,780
That Taera killed your father?

189
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:02,741
That woman's not the real Hong Taera.

190
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:04,200
She deceived us all!

191
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,036
Do you even hear yourself?

192
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:08,371
Who would believe such nonsense?

193
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:12,125
Wait! Hey--

194
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:17,714
The real culprit was found dead
on the day of my special.

195
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,007
What are the chances?

196
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:22,635
Someone concocted that story
to cover up Taera's sins.

197
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,347
I'm even more certain now.

198
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,767
Taera is the real culprit,
and someone's behind it all.

199
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:32,479
-No way.
-I'm not letting this go.

200
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:35,440
I'll unearth the truth alone if I have to.

201
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:44,741
Hello, Sophie?
Do you remember me, Ko Haesoo?

202
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:48,745
Can you help me out?

203
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:52,165
Someone has been posing as your friend,
Hong Taera.

204
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:00,173
Name: Ju Changtae. Age: 44.

205
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:01,257
SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS HQ

206
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:04,010
The former special forces officer
was suspended due to a scandal.

207
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:06,054
We confirmed his criminal charges

208
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:08,807
on illegal firearm distribution
and assault to injury.

209
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:12,018
This map was left with his suicide note.

210
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:16,272
Judging by the document's specificity
of the target point and its coordinates,

211
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:19,693
we conclude that this man is
the late President Ko Taesun's killer.

212
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:22,821
Ju Changtae

213
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:25,156
is the recently retired killer,
No. 41, ma'am.

214
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,910
Why is No. 41 pretending to be
the assassin at a time like this?

215
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,578
It's obvious why.

216
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:33,790
He was forced
into giving a false confession,

217
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,083
then he was killed off.

218
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:37,085
By whom?

219
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:39,295
There's only one man who would do this.

220
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:45,135
Mr. Jo, that son of a bitch,
found a new master so soon.

221
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:54,936
What happened?

222
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:58,189
The police are convinced
the dead man is the real culprit.

223
00:14:58,273 --> 00:15:01,234
Ms. Ko's claims lack evidence,
so nothing can be confirmed.

224
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:08,992
My daughter-in-law isn't so reckless
as to stir the pot without evidence.

225
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:13,413
Are you absolutely certain
Pyo Jaehyun's wife is in the clear?

226
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:17,042
Pyo's camp intends
on taking legal action against Ms. Ko.

227
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,502
His campaign took quite a hit.

228
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:25,258
Contact Chief Yoon. I need to know
if that man really was the real culprit.

229
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:30,680
Get me his investigation reports,
and don't leave a single thing out.

230
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:34,893
It's time he paid his dues.

231
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:39,773
Consider this a new renovation project.

232
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:42,567
-Please be meticulous with everything.
-Yes, sir.

233
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,861
Please store the trash separately.

234
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,571
Let's keep even the small stuff.

235
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:49,157
Yes, sir.
Don't worry and have a great day.

236
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,743
You must be tired.
Here, have some of this.

237
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:53,411
Ma'am, you didn't have to.

238
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:54,829
Thank you.

239
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:56,664
Thank you.

240
00:15:57,582 --> 00:15:59,417
We cleaned the yard pretty recently.

241
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:03,046
Thought we'd start fresh
since Yura's passing.

242
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:09,135
-Are you okay?
-My apologies, sir.

243
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:11,638
-I'm sorry, sir.
-Hey, pull it together!

244
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:13,598
It's fine. I'll just change my shirt.

245
00:16:14,683 --> 00:16:15,684
I'll be right back.

246
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:17,268
M-- My apologies, Mr. Pyo.

247
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:21,398
-I'm so sorry.
-It's fine. I'll take care of him.

248
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,733
Apologies, ma'am.

249
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:25,193
What were you thinking?

250
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,863
-I don't know what happened, it just…
-My goodness.

251
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:31,616
What is it?

252
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,370
Quite a show with the "assassin."

253
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:39,374
Probably concocted by the one
who set up your current life.

254
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:41,292
Pretty amusing, really.

255
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:52,470
As if they're making it known that one who
created you is the one who destroys you.

256
00:16:52,554 --> 00:16:54,097
A creator of sorts.

257
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:59,602
Soon, this manipulator
will reveal themselves to you.

258
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:03,732
Perhaps your life as Hong Taera
will then come to an end.

259
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:40,602
It was you?

260
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:42,645
You're the boss?

261
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:47,525
So you're saying
you never left your study?

262
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:50,487
Right, I emailed the campaign office
once I was finished.

263
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,155
See for yourselves.

264
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,162
We just lost a family member.

265
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:00,246
Watch what you say.

266
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,874
I trust you'll investigate
the case thoroughly.

267
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:05,585
While she was hanging,
she was struck by lightning,

268
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:06,920
which damaged the body.

269
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:10,006
FRACTAL PATTERN SCAR, IMAGES

270
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:13,885
SCAR FORMED BY ELECTRICITY
FROM LIGHTNING STRIKES

271
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:20,433
So was it really you?

272
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:22,560
The man who killed Yura?

273
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:26,106
What about your past?

274
00:18:26,189 --> 00:18:29,734
The Hong Taera I know is a good woman,
and that's enough for me.

275
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:41,037
I would've loved you
no matter who you were.

276
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,750
And I will continue to do so…

277
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:48,712
for the rest of my life.

278
00:19:12,444 --> 00:19:13,987
I'll follow my wife's wishes.

279
00:19:14,738 --> 00:19:17,699
You already know, Mr. Oh.
My wife and Haesoo were very close.

280
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:21,286
The one who's hurting the most is Taera.

281
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:23,288
She's quite heartbroken.

282
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:27,125
I wish I knew why this happened.

283
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:56,029
I don't care what others say.
I want to respect Taera's wishes.

284
00:19:56,905 --> 00:19:58,615
We will not take legal action.

285
00:20:14,506 --> 00:20:16,049
I'll see you at the meeting.

286
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:34,401
You want to kill him
for taking Yura's life?

287
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:49,416
Yes, there. Over there, yeah.

288
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:53,461
-Sir.
-Yeah?

289
00:20:53,545 --> 00:20:56,047
-I found something.
-Really? Bring it here.

290
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:02,178
-Let's see--
-What is it?

291
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:04,764
Yes, sir. We found this in the water.

292
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:07,475
Thank you.

293
00:21:08,226 --> 00:21:09,686
-I'll take a look.
-Yes, sir.

294
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:13,606
-Back to work.
-Yes, sir.

295
00:21:52,437 --> 00:21:54,356
ID CARD - CEO HONG YURA

296
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:09,287
Where did that bitch hide it?

297
00:22:25,428 --> 00:22:29,057
Jaehyun is trying to get
this flash drive I stole from Sungchan.

298
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:32,852
If something happens to me, can you…

299
00:22:37,691 --> 00:22:39,317
give it back to Sungchan?

300
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:49,869
If she trusted me,
why did she have to hurt me?

301
00:22:52,122 --> 00:22:55,542
She could've just lived happily with me.

302
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:56,626
So why?

303
00:22:58,461 --> 00:23:00,630
What is inside this flash drive?

304
00:23:01,464 --> 00:23:04,676
What on earth is in this
that got Yura killed?

305
00:23:08,471 --> 00:23:12,100
It's my life's research.

306
00:23:12,976 --> 00:23:15,353
Hatch's history. My whole life.

307
00:23:16,855 --> 00:23:17,856
Stuff like that.

308
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:23,820
Thank you for returning it.

309
00:23:24,988 --> 00:23:26,823
It was Yura's last request to me.

310
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:31,786
But how did you know, Sungchan?

311
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:36,041
That Jaehyun killed Yura.

312
00:23:49,846 --> 00:23:52,974
This is the watch I gave to Jaehyun
as a wedding gift.

313
00:23:53,058 --> 00:23:56,353
It must've shattered
when it was struck by lightning.

314
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:03,443
Discontinued or not,
you have to find me one, no matter what.

315
00:24:04,694 --> 00:24:07,989
I sent you the model number,
so get it for me quickly.

316
00:24:09,908 --> 00:24:13,161
Do whatever you must to find one.
Money's not a problem.

317
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:34,015
I saw him hide it in a locker at the dock.

318
00:24:35,433 --> 00:24:38,561
But there were bloodstains on it.
So I ran some tests…

319
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:43,066
and it turned out to be Yura's blood.

320
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:44,818
So she left me a voice message,

321
00:24:46,069 --> 00:24:48,154
while she was running from Jaehyun.

322
00:24:51,324 --> 00:24:54,786
I saw lightning strike scars on his back.

323
00:25:00,417 --> 00:25:01,543
I'm sorry, Taera.

324
00:25:02,335 --> 00:25:03,753
I'm going to kill Jaehyun.

325
00:25:03,837 --> 00:25:07,173
I'll kill that bastard.
Then I'll follow Yura soon after.

326
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,304
I can never forgive Jaehyun either.

327
00:25:16,683 --> 00:25:17,976
Help me out, Sungchan.

328
00:25:27,068 --> 00:25:29,821
Chief, why am I fired
from the 8 o'clock news?

329
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:31,865
Let me explain in person.

330
00:25:32,824 --> 00:25:34,200
I've done nothing wrong!

331
00:25:34,909 --> 00:25:36,786
Chief, Chief!

332
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:41,291
Haesoo.

333
00:25:44,961 --> 00:25:46,046
About that day--

334
00:25:49,341 --> 00:25:51,134
Take off the disgusting mask.

335
00:25:52,135 --> 00:25:55,638
You had everything set up,
just so you could fuck me over.

336
00:25:55,722 --> 00:25:58,058
Didn't you accept my offer
with that in mind?

337
00:25:59,267 --> 00:26:00,935
Have you always been so cruel?

338
00:26:02,145 --> 00:26:05,607
If this was always the plan,
why did you save me back then?

339
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:09,027
Why didn't you let me die?
Why did I have to witness shit like this?

340
00:26:14,032 --> 00:26:15,158
I'm sorry, Haesoo.

341
00:26:18,161 --> 00:26:19,162
I'm so sorry.

342
00:26:19,954 --> 00:26:22,791
If you're sorry, confess everything.

343
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:24,876
Reveal the truth.

344
00:26:30,131 --> 00:26:31,132
So you won't?

345
00:26:35,845 --> 00:26:36,846
Cruel bitch.

346
00:26:38,515 --> 00:26:40,475
I'll kill you with my own hands.

347
00:26:54,989 --> 00:26:56,408
I'm sorry, Haesoo.

348
00:26:57,242 --> 00:26:58,993
Please give me some time.

349
00:27:00,745 --> 00:27:04,165
I'll reveal everything,
then I'll ask for your forgiveness.

350
00:27:09,004 --> 00:27:10,005
YBC

351
00:27:10,088 --> 00:27:12,215
The controversy
over Anchor Ko's mental health records

352
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:13,299
is ongoing.

353
00:27:13,383 --> 00:27:17,595
Some say it's revenge
against her husband Jang Dojin's affair

354
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:21,599
with none other than Candidate Pyo's
sister-in-law, as you know.

355
00:27:21,683 --> 00:27:23,643
-I can't accept this.
-Taera's sister.

356
00:27:23,727 --> 00:27:26,062
-You can't fire me.
-Pyo, in this controversy…

357
00:27:26,146 --> 00:27:28,648
I'll show you all the proof I have.

358
00:27:28,732 --> 00:27:31,234
The public will believe me
when they see it.

359
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:34,237
How can you say that crap
when you jeopardized our careers?

360
00:27:34,863 --> 00:27:38,533
Thanks to you,
Song and I are about to get demoted.

361
00:27:38,616 --> 00:27:41,661
Let's reveal the truth!
Isn't that what we're supposed to do?

362
00:27:41,745 --> 00:27:43,663
Stop fighting and just accept it.

363
00:27:43,747 --> 00:27:45,623
They've already caught the suspect.

364
00:27:45,707 --> 00:27:48,626
Why must others suffer
because of your delusions?

365
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:51,254
-You think this station is a joke?
-Chief!

366
00:27:51,338 --> 00:27:52,630
Madam.

367
00:27:52,714 --> 00:27:56,593
If you can't pull yourself together,
just go to a hospital.

368
00:27:56,676 --> 00:28:02,474
Or go to your wealthy in-laws
and ask them to clean up your mess again.

369
00:28:04,351 --> 00:28:05,769
What are you doing?

370
00:28:05,852 --> 00:28:07,187
You want us to drag you out?

371
00:28:11,941 --> 00:28:13,234
You okay, Haesoo?

372
00:28:13,318 --> 00:28:14,486
Did you look into it?

373
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,698
Ju Changtae was recently diagnosed
with terminal colorectal cancer.

374
00:28:19,824 --> 00:28:23,995
It seems like he confessed and killed
himself because he was pushed to the edge.

375
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:27,582
The cops are convinced he's the suspect
and are looking for the mastermind.

376
00:28:27,665 --> 00:28:30,877
The guy in the helmet
who first brought me the photo of No. 50--

377
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,253
Who do you think it was?

378
00:28:33,838 --> 00:28:36,549
Everything he said turned out to be true.

379
00:28:36,633 --> 00:28:38,551
About Hanwool and No. 50.

380
00:28:38,635 --> 00:28:42,639
There's no evidence that No. 50 killed
your father, aside from his message.

381
00:28:42,722 --> 00:28:44,349
Even so, we can't just quit now.

382
00:28:44,432 --> 00:28:46,267
Haesoo, what are you going to do?

383
00:28:46,351 --> 00:28:48,728
It's a journalist's duty
to report the truth.

384
00:28:54,025 --> 00:28:56,945
Hey, are we here to talk nonsense again?

385
00:28:57,028 --> 00:28:58,738
Like you're the only one angry?

386
00:28:58,822 --> 00:29:01,491
How many times did I tell you?
I never took your stuff.

387
00:29:01,574 --> 00:29:03,410
I certainly didn't ask Yura to do it.

388
00:29:04,035 --> 00:29:06,079
I didn't even know you two were dating.

389
00:29:06,162 --> 00:29:08,248
You remember Sujeong from seven years ago?

390
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,586
What about her?

391
00:29:14,629 --> 00:29:17,549
Just wondering.
What do you think happened to her?

392
00:29:18,258 --> 00:29:21,511
Wasn't the loser of the bet
supposed to take full responsibility?

393
00:29:23,013 --> 00:29:24,597
What did Jaehyun say?

394
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,349
How should I know?

395
00:29:27,058 --> 00:29:29,394
Didn't we agree to put the past behind us?

396
00:29:30,186 --> 00:29:31,312
You really don't know?

397
00:29:32,188 --> 00:29:34,441
Jaehyun must've told you something.

398
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:37,819
Aren't you guys seeing each other
behind my back?

399
00:29:37,902 --> 00:29:39,696
What the hell are you trying to say?

400
00:29:41,573 --> 00:29:43,241
You still trust that bastard?

401
00:29:44,075 --> 00:29:46,911
That's why everyone calls you
Pyo Jaehyun's bitch.

402
00:29:46,995 --> 00:29:48,747
You've been his pet dog the whole time,

403
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:51,833
and that's why you got kicked out
of your own company, you fool.

404
00:29:51,916 --> 00:29:54,544
Why you little--
Watch your mouth, douchebag.

405
00:29:55,295 --> 00:29:59,174
Poor Dojin. Silver spoon in your mouth,
and all you know is how to threaten.

406
00:29:59,257 --> 00:30:00,258
What?

407
00:30:00,342 --> 00:30:02,677
You want to use me,
then toss me like Yura?

408
00:30:02,761 --> 00:30:05,221
Or ditch me as you did
to your own brother.

409
00:30:05,305 --> 00:30:06,848
You fucking lunatic--

410
00:30:08,433 --> 00:30:11,895
Hey, how much more
do I have to beg for forgiveness?

411
00:30:11,978 --> 00:30:14,522
You think I'm a pushover
because I need forgiveness?

412
00:30:14,606 --> 00:30:15,648
Damn it.

413
00:30:16,524 --> 00:30:18,860
Just go. Get out of here
and stay out of my sight.

414
00:30:19,444 --> 00:30:20,820
We're done. For good.

415
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:22,781
Shit.

416
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:27,535
Bastard knows everything

417
00:30:28,787 --> 00:30:30,580
about what Jaehyun did to Sujeong.

418
00:30:50,141 --> 00:30:53,770
DELIVER TO: JANG DOJIN
SENT FROM: HONG YURA

419
00:31:11,621 --> 00:31:14,708
What happened to Kyojin isn't your fault.

420
00:31:15,792 --> 00:31:17,460
So get back on your bike.

421
00:31:18,294 --> 00:31:21,965
I want to watch you
ride your bike some day.

422
00:31:26,302 --> 00:31:29,347
This doesn't sound like someone
who's about to end her life.

423
00:31:33,601 --> 00:31:35,729
Director Kim Seondeok
of Hanwool Mental Hospital

424
00:31:35,812 --> 00:31:38,398
has been secretly training assassins
in the annex building.

425
00:31:39,232 --> 00:31:40,650
And Hong Taera was one of them.

426
00:31:42,193 --> 00:31:46,489
For 15 years, she had me fooled
by pretending she had amnesia.

427
00:31:47,365 --> 00:31:49,367
However, there is another Hong Taera.

428
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:55,457
This woman in the middle
is the real Hong Taera.

429
00:31:56,332 --> 00:31:59,210
I've confirmed this
with Hong Taera's close friend, Sophie.

430
00:31:59,294 --> 00:32:02,672
I will now speak to Sophie
to prove what I'm saying is true.

431
00:32:08,845 --> 00:32:11,723
The number
you have reached is no longer in service.

432
00:32:12,349 --> 00:32:13,683
Your call cannot be--

433
00:32:13,767 --> 00:32:16,269
That's odd.
I talked to her yesterday.

434
00:32:17,854 --> 00:32:20,565
The number
you have reached is no longer in service.

435
00:32:20,648 --> 00:32:23,026
-Haesoo, let's call it a day.
-Your call cannot be--

436
00:32:23,526 --> 00:32:25,070
Something's wrong.

437
00:32:25,612 --> 00:32:28,406
Sophie promised to help me
reveal the truth about Hong Taera.

438
00:32:29,407 --> 00:32:30,825
I should go meet her.

439
00:32:30,909 --> 00:32:33,119
That's enough!
Come on, you did all you can.

440
00:32:33,703 --> 00:32:35,330
Do you not believe me either?

441
00:32:35,413 --> 00:32:38,083
You think I'm lying?
That I've lost my mind?

442
00:32:38,166 --> 00:32:40,085
You're acting strangely!

443
00:32:40,168 --> 00:32:42,337
-Let's go.
-I'm telling the truth!

444
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:44,381
Why won't you believe me? Why?

445
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:51,096
INCOMING CALL
CHAIRMAN JANG KUMMO

446
00:32:55,767 --> 00:32:57,227
We're not suing anyone.

447
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:59,437
Don't hold Haesoo accountable
for anything.

448
00:33:00,271 --> 00:33:02,982
I hear Ko Haesoo is preparing
an exclusive interview.

449
00:33:03,066 --> 00:33:05,443
If we don't speak up,
it'll only get worse.

450
00:33:05,527 --> 00:33:07,529
We have to issue a rebuttal, ma'am.

451
00:33:07,612 --> 00:33:10,949
I made myself clear. I won't do it.

452
00:33:12,117 --> 00:33:13,451
Excuse me.

453
00:33:13,535 --> 00:33:14,536
M-- Ma'am.

454
00:33:16,579 --> 00:33:19,332
What do we do?
Reporters have been calling me all day.

455
00:33:21,334 --> 00:33:23,128
Put together a press statement.

456
00:33:23,211 --> 00:33:24,337
Sir?

457
00:33:24,421 --> 00:33:27,507
You're going to do it?
Did you not see Taera Hong's face?

458
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:30,051
Would you blow an opportunity like this?

459
00:33:30,135 --> 00:33:32,762
What? Are we giving up on Candidate Pyo?

460
00:33:34,305 --> 00:33:38,143
Regarding Ms. Ko's actions, Candidate Pyo,
his family, and the campaign team

461
00:33:38,226 --> 00:33:40,353
found them quite regrettable.

462
00:33:40,437 --> 00:33:43,273
However, Mr. Pyo will not
pursue litigation for defamation

463
00:33:43,356 --> 00:33:45,025
due to Ms. Hong's strong objection.

464
00:33:46,151 --> 00:33:49,738
If Ko Haesoo's accusations are false,
why stop the litigation?

465
00:33:49,821 --> 00:33:54,451
Hong Taera and Ko Haesoo shared
a sisterly relationship for over 10 years.

466
00:33:54,534 --> 00:33:58,413
She's trying her best to be understanding
and is offering help.

467
00:33:58,496 --> 00:34:02,000
Therefore, she no longer wishes to
make an issue of this situation.

468
00:34:02,083 --> 00:34:06,004
Ms. Hong hopes the public's perception
of Ms. Ko will not decline any further,

469
00:34:06,087 --> 00:34:07,756
and sincerely asks…

470
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:11,926
-How can I not love Hong Taera?
-…that the public show compassion.

471
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:13,720
Candidate Pyo's campaign--

472
00:34:18,224 --> 00:34:21,102
The job has been handled.

473
00:34:23,063 --> 00:34:24,397
It was impressive.

474
00:34:24,481 --> 00:34:27,484
And the timing of the fake suspect's death
was just right.

475
00:34:28,485 --> 00:34:29,861
You've outdone yourself.

476
00:34:31,529 --> 00:34:32,655
It's my honor.

477
00:34:33,281 --> 00:34:35,575
Now I'm in league with the next president.

478
00:34:36,201 --> 00:34:42,332
As you predicted, Ko's behavior
will make you the next president, Mr. Pyo.

479
00:34:49,631 --> 00:34:52,050
Rome wasn't built in a day.

480
00:34:57,931 --> 00:35:00,475
You'll be paying me another visit
very soon, Mr. Pyo.

481
00:35:11,695 --> 00:35:13,154
This isn't enough…

482
00:35:14,864 --> 00:35:17,367
for the eye that bitch, No. 50,
took from me.

483
00:35:21,996 --> 00:35:24,708
I'm sure you already know, Reporter Yoon.

484
00:35:25,333 --> 00:35:29,421
How devoted Hanwool has been
to community service for many years.

485
00:35:35,135 --> 00:35:38,346
Ms. Ko also came here
and asked us the same thing--

486
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:40,223
About killers or some nonsense--

487
00:35:41,975 --> 00:35:45,020
Of course, the police will have
our full cooperation.

488
00:35:45,103 --> 00:35:46,646
We have nothing to hide.

489
00:35:50,275 --> 00:35:51,276
All right then.

490
00:35:52,527 --> 00:35:55,363
I look forward to reading your article.

491
00:36:01,911 --> 00:36:04,789
How dare that bitch run her mouth?

492
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:08,960
We've shut down the annex.

493
00:36:09,044 --> 00:36:10,587
What should we do about Ko?

494
00:36:13,131 --> 00:36:14,716
Ko Haesoo…

495
00:36:19,137 --> 00:36:22,599
CONTACT INFORMATION
HAESOO

496
00:36:30,732 --> 00:36:32,400
How may I help you, ma'am?

497
00:36:32,984 --> 00:36:34,277
There you are. Where's Jiu?

498
00:36:34,861 --> 00:36:35,987
She's playing outside.

499
00:36:39,449 --> 00:36:40,450
Here.

500
00:36:41,785 --> 00:36:43,745
I'm grateful for your help last time.

501
00:36:43,828 --> 00:36:46,122
Take it as a bribe
for your continued service.

502
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,458
You shouldn't have.

503
00:36:51,419 --> 00:36:52,796
It's no big deal.

504
00:36:52,879 --> 00:36:55,715
Just think of it as a gift
from your big sister.

505
00:36:56,591 --> 00:36:57,842
Looks like a perfect fit!

506
00:37:00,553 --> 00:37:01,680
Hold on.

507
00:37:12,273 --> 00:37:14,317
INCOMING CALL
MOTHER

508
00:37:17,821 --> 00:37:19,864
It's time to move, No. 105.

509
00:37:21,658 --> 00:37:23,993
Get ready for tonight.

510
00:37:25,578 --> 00:37:27,539
The target to eliminate is…

511
00:37:29,499 --> 00:37:30,500
Ko Haesoo.

512
00:37:41,553 --> 00:37:44,139
Why won't you play ball with me?

513
00:37:44,222 --> 00:37:47,350
Hey, we can't hang out
like this right now.

514
00:37:47,434 --> 00:37:50,228
Hey! At least tell me why.

515
00:37:51,312 --> 00:37:53,398
You're seven. Don't you watch the news?

516
00:37:53,481 --> 00:37:55,817
Things are so bad
between your mom and my mom.

517
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:58,778
You see, they got into a huge fight.

518
00:37:58,862 --> 00:38:01,406
They were talking about suing each other.

519
00:38:01,489 --> 00:38:03,074
We shouldn't play together!

520
00:38:03,158 --> 00:38:06,911
So are you going to sue me
if I keep asking you to play ball?

521
00:38:06,995 --> 00:38:07,996
Geez.

522
00:38:08,538 --> 00:38:12,292
Why would I sue you?
We're not the ones fighting.

523
00:38:12,375 --> 00:38:13,793
Then it's fine.

524
00:38:14,627 --> 00:38:16,046
I'll let you kick first then.

525
00:38:16,129 --> 00:38:19,174
Hey, Pyo Jiu!
Do you even understand what I'm saying?

526
00:38:19,257 --> 00:38:20,258
I do!

527
00:38:20,842 --> 00:38:22,761
But there's something you don't know.

528
00:38:24,179 --> 00:38:26,765
My mom and Auntie Haesoo are besties.

529
00:38:26,848 --> 00:38:29,017
Besties fight and make up in no time.

530
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,603
That's why they're besties.

531
00:38:32,228 --> 00:38:35,815
But I guess you wouldn't get it
since you have no friends.

532
00:38:37,567 --> 00:38:40,779
Jiu, Jiu! Aren't you my bestie?

533
00:38:40,862 --> 00:38:45,116
Jiu! Jiu, Jiu!

534
00:38:46,034 --> 00:38:48,453
DIVORCE REGISTRATION
CHILD CUSTODY DESIGNATION

535
00:38:50,997 --> 00:38:52,832
Kumjo stock prices have plummeted,

536
00:38:54,209 --> 00:38:57,170
and I hear people have stopped
purchasing Kumjo products.

537
00:38:57,754 --> 00:38:58,755
Well…

538
00:38:59,881 --> 00:39:02,175
That's enough insanity from you.

539
00:39:04,135 --> 00:39:05,387
Sign it.

540
00:39:09,224 --> 00:39:11,309
Father, please believe me, just this once.

541
00:39:12,477 --> 00:39:16,356
Hong Taera and Director Kim from Hanwool
teamed up and killed my father--

542
00:39:16,439 --> 00:39:18,233
You think cops are idiots?

543
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,610
I've looked into it too.

544
00:39:20,694 --> 00:39:24,364
Must I also be duped
into your talk of nonsense?

545
00:39:24,447 --> 00:39:25,490
It's all for show.

546
00:39:26,282 --> 00:39:29,828
Taera came up with a fake suspect to hide
the fact that she's the real killer.

547
00:39:32,622 --> 00:39:33,623
Do you have…

548
00:39:34,124 --> 00:39:35,125
any evidence?

549
00:39:38,795 --> 00:39:40,547
Walk away from the marriage.

550
00:39:41,297 --> 00:39:42,424
You're no longer…

551
00:39:43,466 --> 00:39:45,093
a part of Kumjo.

552
00:39:45,176 --> 00:39:47,345
Please help me, Father. I'm begging you.

553
00:39:48,346 --> 00:39:51,891
Please help me reveal the truth.
Just this once--

554
00:39:51,975 --> 00:39:54,519
Please believe me. Please.

555
00:39:58,106 --> 00:39:59,983
Haesoo. Haesoo, get up.

556
00:40:00,608 --> 00:40:01,776
Stand up, Haesoo.

557
00:40:05,947 --> 00:40:08,283
I believe everything she said.

558
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:13,580
That Hong Taera is her father's killer
and that Pyo Jaehyun is a part of it.

559
00:40:13,663 --> 00:40:16,041
So please, Father, help her.

560
00:40:16,124 --> 00:40:19,002
Please help her find the mastermind
behind it all.

561
00:40:21,546 --> 00:40:24,799
I told you not to bring her
into this family. Yet you defied me--

562
00:40:24,883 --> 00:40:26,176
All for what?

563
00:40:26,259 --> 00:40:29,054
You think I'll sit around
and watch you two ruin Kumjo?

564
00:40:29,137 --> 00:40:30,513
I'll come back…

565
00:40:30,597 --> 00:40:31,806
to Kumjo.

566
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:41,900
If you agree to help Haesoo,
I'll do as you wish and take over Kumjo.

567
00:40:43,651 --> 00:40:45,403
Please help her, just this once.

568
00:40:45,487 --> 00:40:49,199
Do everything you can for Haesoo,
whatever it may be.

569
00:41:17,852 --> 00:41:18,853
Thanks.

570
00:41:23,066 --> 00:41:25,652
Honestly, I didn't expect
support from you.

571
00:41:27,278 --> 00:41:30,907
I didn't think you loved me anymore.

572
00:41:33,868 --> 00:41:36,037
I assumed there might be another woman.

573
00:41:37,205 --> 00:41:38,957
I just didn't think it'd be Yura.

574
00:41:40,125 --> 00:41:42,168
Haesoo, that's--

575
00:41:42,252 --> 00:41:43,336
No need to apologize.

576
00:41:44,379 --> 00:41:46,339
I admit I'd been neglecting you.

577
00:41:50,427 --> 00:41:51,428
I know…

578
00:41:52,429 --> 00:41:54,556
that I've been stuck in the past 15 years

579
00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:56,516
and still can't move one step forward.

580
00:41:59,769 --> 00:42:01,646
But that's how badly I want to know…

581
00:42:02,897 --> 00:42:04,441
what really happened that day.

582
00:42:06,735 --> 00:42:07,736
I can't…

583
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:11,448
get any closer to you
until I find the truth.

584
00:42:36,765 --> 00:42:37,766
Haesoo.

585
00:42:39,142 --> 00:42:41,394
Why do you believe
Hong Taera is the suspect?

586
00:42:42,187 --> 00:42:43,271
Tell me everything.

587
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:54,366
Are you really going to help Ms. Ko?

588
00:42:55,867 --> 00:42:58,328
The evidence against
the deceased suspect is clear.

589
00:42:59,829 --> 00:43:02,582
What choice do I have
if I want Dojin back at Kumjo?

590
00:43:03,458 --> 00:43:04,793
I'll pretend to help.

591
00:43:06,795 --> 00:43:10,799
Dojin needs to gain more power…

592
00:43:12,384 --> 00:43:14,052
for him to protect me and Kumjo.

593
00:43:32,445 --> 00:43:33,446
Kyojin.

594
00:43:34,781 --> 00:43:36,366
I'm right here.

595
00:43:37,158 --> 00:43:38,743
Can you hear me?

596
00:43:40,161 --> 00:43:43,081
Kyojin, open your eyes.

597
00:43:43,623 --> 00:43:45,625
I'm right here, Kyojin. Look at me.

598
00:43:46,584 --> 00:43:47,585
Kyojin.

599
00:43:56,219 --> 00:44:01,266
Kyojin! Thank you so much, my son.
Thank you, Kyojin!

600
00:44:03,768 --> 00:44:06,229
There is a way…

601
00:44:07,105 --> 00:44:08,231
to wake Kyojin up.

602
00:44:09,149 --> 00:44:10,150
Really?

603
00:44:10,233 --> 00:44:11,735
Will you trust me?

604
00:44:19,451 --> 00:44:21,953
Jaehyun, Kyojin just--

605
00:44:23,121 --> 00:44:25,665
Kyojin just opened his eyes.

606
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:28,251
Really?

607
00:44:28,918 --> 00:44:30,003
Are you sure, Ms. Min?

608
00:44:34,466 --> 00:44:36,509
Wow. How wonderful.

609
00:44:37,093 --> 00:44:41,848
Do you really think Kyojin
will be able to walk again?

610
00:44:41,931 --> 00:44:44,309
Are you sure he can be
the way he was before?

611
00:44:44,893 --> 00:44:45,894
Of course, Ms. Min.

612
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:48,063
You can trust me.

613
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:50,565
You just have to do exactly as I say.

614
00:44:51,107 --> 00:44:54,944
But you must keep this a secret
from both Dojin and Chairman Jang.

615
00:44:55,904 --> 00:44:57,072
Do you understand?

616
00:44:57,155 --> 00:45:00,533
Okay, Jaehyun.
I'll put my trust in you.

617
00:45:25,725 --> 00:45:26,726
What's this?

618
00:45:27,686 --> 00:45:29,688
SERIAL NUMBER
MJPSD00372-4

619
00:45:29,771 --> 00:45:31,272
Isn't this blue sapphire?

620
00:45:34,067 --> 00:45:35,985
JEWELRY A CLIENT GAVE
TO DIRECTOR KIM 15 YEARS AGO

621
00:45:36,069 --> 00:45:37,320
DON'T FORGET! THE SUSPECT IS NO. 50.

622
00:45:37,404 --> 00:45:39,906
Kim Seondeok received this sapphire
from her client.

623
00:45:39,989 --> 00:45:42,325
If we find this jewelry,
we find the mastermind.

624
00:45:43,743 --> 00:45:46,538
Get a list of buyers
with the partial serial number.

625
00:45:46,621 --> 00:45:50,417
And by checking the sale routes,
we'll find the owner of the jewelry.

626
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:53,586
Can we trust this person?
We don't even know who this is.

627
00:45:55,338 --> 00:45:56,881
So let's check it out.

628
00:45:58,425 --> 00:46:00,176
To me, the suspect is still Taera.

629
00:46:06,558 --> 00:46:08,518
Sorry to be the bearer of bad news.

630
00:46:08,601 --> 00:46:11,563
We're asking you to stay out
of the smart patch human trials.

631
00:46:12,605 --> 00:46:13,606
Shit.

632
00:46:14,107 --> 00:46:16,276
Is something wrong? Who is it?

633
00:46:16,359 --> 00:46:19,696
It's nothing. Go home first.
I'll be back soon.

634
00:46:28,872 --> 00:46:31,082
Who the hell are you?

635
00:46:37,005 --> 00:46:39,507
Hey, Mr. Park,
I was just about to call you.

636
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:42,344
-The helmet…
-Haesoo, help me!

637
00:46:43,636 --> 00:46:45,513
What happened? What's going on?

638
00:46:45,597 --> 00:46:49,351
Hanwool sent assassins to kill me.

639
00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:51,811
Hello?

640
00:46:51,895 --> 00:46:53,938
Mr. Park. Mr. Park. Can you hear me?

641
00:46:55,148 --> 00:46:58,276
If you want him to live,
get over here now.

642
00:47:00,862 --> 00:47:01,863
Where to?

643
00:47:03,114 --> 00:47:06,076
FROM HONG TAERA'S SUPPORT TEAM
CHEER UP, HONG TAERA

644
00:47:14,793 --> 00:47:18,380
I warned you that Ko Haesoo
shouldn't be kept alive.

645
00:47:20,173 --> 00:47:21,466
What does that mean?

646
00:47:22,258 --> 00:47:25,553
I'll eliminate Ko Haesoo without a trace.

647
00:47:26,846 --> 00:47:27,847
Aren't you thankful?

648
00:47:27,931 --> 00:47:30,600
Honestly, isn't she getting on
your nerves too?

649
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:37,148
No. Don't do anything to Haesoo.

650
00:48:07,012 --> 00:48:08,680
Move. Don't you know who I am?

651
00:48:08,763 --> 00:48:11,725
It's a direct order from the chairman.
You may not enter.

652
00:48:11,808 --> 00:48:13,727
I said move.

653
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:16,855
-I said move!
-Get out!

654
00:48:16,938 --> 00:48:18,106
-Move!
-Let's talk.

655
00:48:24,696 --> 00:48:26,072
Stay out of human trials?

656
00:48:26,156 --> 00:48:29,325
Are you trying to remove me
from the smart patch research?

657
00:48:29,409 --> 00:48:31,411
I received a call from Hanwool.

658
00:48:31,494 --> 00:48:35,623
Director Kim said she wouldn't support
any research that you're involved in--

659
00:48:36,833 --> 00:48:39,461
The police are investigating her
because of Haesoo.

660
00:48:39,544 --> 00:48:42,088
Don't make this harder,
and just stay out of it.

661
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:44,674
What about Kyojin? You're just giving up?

662
00:48:45,383 --> 00:48:47,469
You're the one who rushed the research.

663
00:48:47,552 --> 00:48:49,971
Your own mother is against it too.

664
00:48:50,513 --> 00:48:51,514
She feels uneasy.

665
00:48:52,599 --> 00:48:54,142
I don't trust you either.

666
00:48:54,225 --> 00:48:55,810
Do you even want to…

667
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:58,063
save Kyojin?

668
00:48:58,855 --> 00:48:59,856
What?

669
00:48:59,939 --> 00:49:02,317
Honestly, I'm uncomfortable
talking to you now.

670
00:49:02,901 --> 00:49:04,277
Think of what Haesoo did.

671
00:49:04,903 --> 00:49:07,155
Taera's the only reason I'm holding back.

672
00:49:07,238 --> 00:49:08,656
Do you trust your wife?

673
00:49:09,699 --> 00:49:13,453
Taera, full of a mysterious past
that she doesn't even remember?

674
00:49:13,536 --> 00:49:16,289
I trust her, with all my heart.

675
00:49:17,832 --> 00:49:20,960
Right.
That's why I'm going to trust Haesoo.

676
00:49:23,713 --> 00:49:26,299
I guess the truth will be revealed soon.

677
00:49:58,873 --> 00:50:02,460
If Dojin finds out, he'll totally flip.

678
00:50:02,544 --> 00:50:03,837
You sure this is okay?

679
00:50:04,713 --> 00:50:07,424
It's a favor for Ms. Min.
She doesn't trust Dojin.

680
00:50:08,633 --> 00:50:12,804
We don't have much time.
Let's wake him up, as soon as possible.

681
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:18,518
-I have something to tell you.
-What is it?

682
00:50:18,601 --> 00:50:23,857
I won't share human trial results
with anyone for now. Not even you.

683
00:50:25,483 --> 00:50:26,568
I'll do it on my own.

684
00:50:28,403 --> 00:50:29,446
What's this about?

685
00:50:29,529 --> 00:50:30,613
Well, it's just…

686
00:50:31,281 --> 00:50:33,408
I can't trust Dojin,

687
00:50:33,491 --> 00:50:36,202
and you dealt with Red's situation poorly.

688
00:50:36,286 --> 00:50:38,163
You'll be the first to know

689
00:50:38,246 --> 00:50:41,666
when the research has solid results
and I feel confident.

690
00:50:43,376 --> 00:50:45,003
So just wait.

691
00:50:45,086 --> 00:50:49,007
For the time being,
isn't waking up Kyojin our top priority?

692
00:50:51,343 --> 00:50:53,261
Will you be okay on your own?

693
00:50:53,345 --> 00:50:54,387
Your files are gone.

694
00:50:56,514 --> 00:50:57,515
Well,

695
00:50:58,516 --> 00:51:01,561
I supervised all of Hatch's research
until now,

696
00:51:01,644 --> 00:51:04,522
and I'm the only one
with the skills at Hatch.

697
00:51:07,692 --> 00:51:09,986
What? You don't trust me?

698
00:51:16,326 --> 00:51:17,660
I always trust you.

699
00:51:18,787 --> 00:51:20,205
All right. Suit yourself.

700
00:51:20,288 --> 00:51:22,082
As you said, Kyojin's top priority.

701
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:25,502
Thanks for understanding.

702
00:51:28,421 --> 00:51:29,839
Goodbye now.

703
00:51:31,508 --> 00:51:32,926
All right.

704
00:51:57,617 --> 00:52:00,036
The arrogant bastard stole
someone else's work

705
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:01,579
to secure a place in this company.

706
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:03,790
It's all because of that bitch, Hong Yura.

707
00:52:03,873 --> 00:52:07,252
If I had the flash drive,
I wouldn't have to take this shit.

708
00:52:07,335 --> 00:52:08,378
Wait a minute.

709
00:52:10,046 --> 00:52:12,424
Why is he so confident
if his files are missing?

710
00:52:14,843 --> 00:52:16,678
Did he find the files himself?

711
00:52:27,397 --> 00:52:29,649
What more is there left to say?

712
00:52:29,733 --> 00:52:32,235
I thought I made myself perfectly clear.

713
00:52:32,777 --> 00:52:33,820
I'm not interested.

714
00:52:36,865 --> 00:52:40,827
It's not so easy cutting someone off
once you've made an alliance, is it?

715
00:52:43,038 --> 00:52:44,289
By the way,

716
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:49,169
I wonder who'll be moving
into the CEO office at Hatch.

717
00:52:49,753 --> 00:52:52,714
I love how comfortable the sofas are.

718
00:53:06,394 --> 00:53:07,437
I promise…

719
00:53:08,688 --> 00:53:09,898
to save you, Kyojin.

720
00:53:22,786 --> 00:53:24,662
BRAIN STATE - DNA STATES

721
00:53:51,064 --> 00:53:54,109
Hang in there, Kyojin.
Just a little longer.

722
00:54:49,748 --> 00:54:50,749
Kyojin.

723
00:54:52,625 --> 00:54:54,336
It's me, Sungchan.

724
00:54:59,090 --> 00:55:00,258
Do you recognize me?

725
00:55:08,558 --> 00:55:09,809
Kyojin.

726
00:55:09,893 --> 00:55:11,394
Who did this to you?

727
00:55:12,479 --> 00:55:13,480
Is it Dojin?

728
00:55:17,817 --> 00:55:18,818
Then is it…

729
00:55:20,236 --> 00:55:21,237
Jaehyun?

730
00:55:28,411 --> 00:55:31,247
I told you, I've no interest
in giving you the upper hand.

731
00:55:32,832 --> 00:55:35,377
Whatever you got,
we will never be partners.

732
00:55:36,002 --> 00:55:37,170
So don't ever come ba--

733
00:55:59,401 --> 00:56:01,736
The night of Hong Yura's death…

734
00:56:02,362 --> 00:56:05,448
What were you doing at the dock
near the lake, Mr. Pyo?

735
00:56:05,532 --> 00:56:07,701
Wearing a black raincoat?

736
00:56:14,082 --> 00:56:18,044
Looks like you're willing to talk,
judging by the look on your face.

737
00:56:20,296 --> 00:56:23,550
Hatch is currently worth
over 20 trillion won.

738
00:56:28,179 --> 00:56:31,266
Why don't you hand Hatch over to me?

739
00:56:45,071 --> 00:56:46,990
INCOMING CALL
TAERA

740
00:57:01,212 --> 00:57:04,090
Your call cannot be completed
as dialed. Please leave a message…

741
00:57:17,687 --> 00:57:18,772
Where the hell is he?

742
00:57:19,814 --> 00:57:22,442
Mr. Park! Mr. Park, where are you?

743
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:38,875
The phone is switched off.
Please leave a message after the tone.

744
00:57:51,346 --> 00:57:52,389
Not Haesoo.

745
00:57:53,848 --> 00:57:54,974
Don't touch her.

746
00:58:39,144 --> 00:58:40,145
Pilseung.

747
00:58:59,539 --> 00:59:00,915
Mr. Park!

748
00:59:03,918 --> 00:59:04,919
Mr. Park.

749
00:59:07,922 --> 00:59:08,923
Mr. Park.

750
00:59:14,596 --> 00:59:15,597
Mr. Park.

751
01:00:13,446 --> 01:00:14,447
Mr. Park?

752
01:00:19,744 --> 01:00:20,745
Mr. Park.

753
01:00:37,887 --> 01:00:39,347
It's time you give up on Haesoo.

754
01:00:40,306 --> 01:00:41,474
Over my dead body.

755
01:01:33,318 --> 01:01:34,319
It was you?

756
01:01:59,344 --> 01:02:00,470
You survived.

757
01:02:06,059 --> 01:02:07,060
Thank you…

758
01:02:08,228 --> 01:02:09,270
for surviving.

759
01:03:05,785 --> 01:03:09,039
Does Taera know
about what you're telling me now?

760
01:03:09,831 --> 01:03:11,499
Why didn't you tell me he was alive?

761
01:03:11,583 --> 01:03:14,252
You wanted to see
how long it'd take me to find out?

762
01:03:14,336 --> 01:03:15,545
Were you amused?

763
01:03:15,628 --> 01:03:19,215
I have control of the cameras.
Let's begin.

764
01:03:19,299 --> 01:03:21,426
-Do you see me?
-Are you hiding something from me?

765
01:03:22,552 --> 01:03:25,764
KDP is running with your story
about Hong Taera.

766
01:03:25,847 --> 01:03:29,517
-Why haven't you killed No. 50?
-No! Please stop, Hajun.

767
01:03:29,601 --> 01:03:33,688
I have everything you're talking about.
