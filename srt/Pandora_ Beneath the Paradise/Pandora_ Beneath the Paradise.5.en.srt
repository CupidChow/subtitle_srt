PANDORA : BENEATH THE PARADISE

2
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:11,423
I found this at Sungchan's.

3
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:15,844
Are you done with me now?

4
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:20,140
Here's your ticket to France.
You leave early tomorrow.

5
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:23,351
The $2 million will be wired to you
the moment you land.

6
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:29,274
Sungchan is coming after me.
Don't let him see you leave.

7
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:30,900
Boss told me to tell you,

8
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:33,820
"You've been a great partner."

9
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:42,954
The boss said that?

10
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:46,499
Chairman Jang said that?

11
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,989
It was you?

12
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,408
You're the boss?

13
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,861
Please pick up, Taera!

14
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:07,122
Ko Haesoo! Stop the car!

15
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:27,934
Stop fussing, Hong Taera.

16
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:32,897
You've never felt the pain of losing
your loved ones before your eyes.

17
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,817
Now you will.

18
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,048
Let go!

19
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:05,323
EPISODE 5

20
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,640
Haesoo!

21
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:33,143
Haesoo!

22
00:06:58,001 --> 00:06:59,085
Haesoo.

23
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:01,921
Where is my daughter?

24
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,134
I see you've caught up to us.

25
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:07,969
Do you not trust me?

26
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:09,679
Why did you bring her here?

27
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,222
What have you done to Jiu?

28
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:26,071
Jiu!

29
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:29,366
Jiu! Pyo Jiu!

30
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:32,369
Jiu!

31
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,706
Jiu! Pyo Jiu!

32
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,709
Jiu.

33
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,961
Jiu! Pyo Jiu!

34
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:45,632
No-- Jiu.

35
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:47,717
No.

36
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,765
Mommy, are you here to take me home?

37
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,436
Jiu.

38
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:01,940
You okay, honey?

39
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:04,651
-Did something happen? Are you hurt?
-I'm fine.

40
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:08,530
Auntie, I found a snail. You were right.

41
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:12,826
See? I told you they come out
when it rains.

42
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:16,037
Can I keep it, Mommy?

43
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:21,084
-Of course.
-Auntie bought us steak.

44
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:25,046
I ate tons more than Leo.

45
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,548
Good girl.

46
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:29,050
Jiu, it's too dark out
for us to be having fun,

47
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:31,011
so your mommy's not happy with me.

48
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,178
Shall we go home now?

49
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,639
Mmm. I'll be in the car, Mommy.

50
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:45,608
Did you actually think I'd do something
to her? She's like a daughter to me.

51
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,322
Why are you doing this?

52
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:55,702
What do you want from me?

53
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:56,828
What do I want?

54
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,041
Good question.

55
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,045
Oh, right.

56
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:07,881
Will you and Jaehyun appear on my special?

57
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:12,302
The entire nation's curious about you.

58
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:16,222
So, let's show everyone who you are
on the show.

59
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,600
It's the least you can do for me,

60
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,643
don't you think?

61
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,148
I just want to help, is all,

62
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,192
so you can become the first lady.

63
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,785
I'm counting on you.

64
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:38,953
My dear friend,

65
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,498
Taera.

66
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:15,949
Police cars.

67
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:37,345
What's going on?

68
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:44,352
Taera.

69
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:53,528
Jiu, come to Daddy.

70
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:03,246
Wait. My sister.

71
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,456
My sister.

72
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:45,413
Yura

73
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,332
is dead?

74
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:12,315
The tutor's taking care of Jiu.
Don't worry.

75
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:14,484
How did this happen?

76
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,153
I thought she was in France on business.

77
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,406
When's the last time you two spoke?

78
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:21,449
Well…

79
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:25,745
What's the cause of death?

80
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:29,082
We need more time to confirm,
but it looks like a suicide.

81
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:32,752
While she was hanging, she was struck
by lightning, which damaged the body.

82
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:35,922
Are you certain it's a suicide?
Have you found a suicide note?

83
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:39,384
We haven't, but circumstantial evidence
indicates suicide.

84
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,261
May we access the security footage?

85
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:43,346
We'll give you anything you need.

86
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,974
I trust you'll investigate the case
thoroughly.

87
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:50,061
I assume this case may cause
a lot of noise while you campaign.

88
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:51,604
We'll try to wrap it up soon.

89
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:53,481
We just lost a family member.

90
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:55,233
I suggest you watch what you say.

91
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,152
My mistake, sir.

92
00:12:57,652 --> 00:13:01,281
May we briefly interview all of you here
for the investigation?

93
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:02,365
Let's do it.

94
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:06,703
What's up?

95
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:09,039
Did you kill her?

96
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:10,915
What? What the hell are you--

97
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,882
Why would you even say that?

98
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:27,349
I went to pick up my daughter.
She was with Haesoo.

99
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:30,435
I got home at around 10:00 p.m.

100
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:35,398
Taera's right. We were together.

101
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:38,401
The police were already here
when we returned.

102
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:41,279
I was working in my study.

103
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:44,699
You kept working
even after the power outage?

104
00:13:44,783 --> 00:13:47,285
I was upset because I didn't save my work.

105
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:50,955
I was busy recovering the document
by using backup power.

106
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:56,336
I came home after a workout,
then I took a shower and had a short nap.

107
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:04,010
So you're saying
you never left your study?

108
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:07,222
Right. I emailed the campaign office
once I was finished.

109
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:08,431
See for yourselves.

110
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:11,309
Your loss if you choose not to talk.

111
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:13,019
Where were you at around 10:00 p.m.?

112
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:19,818
I choose to remain silent
until my attorney arrives.

113
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:30,495
You're an insomniac. You can't take naps,
no matter how tired you get.

114
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:31,913
Hey.

115
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,873
What are you insinuating?

116
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:35,041
Sure you were home?

117
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:38,003
Are you hiding something--

118
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:39,379
I have nothing to hide.

119
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:06,156
Would it be all right
if I just stayed quietly by Dojin's side?

120
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,657
-Get out!
-Let go of this!

121
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:08,908
-Get--
-I said let go!

122
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,786
I have something to say to the chairman.

123
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,246
Chairman, all this time, I've--

124
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:15,832
The earring

125
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,501
was Yura's?

126
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:29,346
I don't believe it.

127
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:31,806
Was it you, Dojin?

128
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:26,194
Please calm down, Sungchan.

129
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,321
Hear me out.

130
00:16:30,532 --> 00:16:32,701
You're scaring me. Don't be like this.

131
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:36,496
Come here.

132
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:40,750
-Yura, come here.
-Let me explain.

133
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:45,046
This-- This has been painful for me too.

134
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:49,551
They made me do it by threatening me,
so please…

135
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:52,220
Come here, damn it!

136
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:00,562
Yura, you little shit.

137
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:13,575
Why did you do it?

138
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:16,703
Why?

139
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:20,707
I'm telling you right now.

140
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,625
I will never leave Haesoo.

141
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,837
You break my family apart?

142
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,630
I just might kill you.

143
00:17:36,598 --> 00:17:37,599
You were right.

144
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:41,061
It wasn't your fault, Yura.

145
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:44,856
Jang Dojin…

146
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,863
All of this is that bastard's fault.

147
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:55,325
Jang Dojin.

148
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:02,749
Fuck!

149
00:18:06,878 --> 00:18:08,171
Sungchan, stop!

150
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:10,632
You nuts? What are you doing?

151
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:11,883
Move.

152
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:15,970
I'm going to kill Dojin, that bastard!
Move!

153
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:17,931
What did Dojin do?

154
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:19,891
What happened? What's gotten into you?

155
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:21,601
He took everything from me.

156
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:26,648
He had me fooled, and that son of a bitch
took everything from me!

157
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:28,066
What?

158
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:30,318
What are you saying?

159
00:18:30,402 --> 00:18:34,406
Yura and Dojin
were seeing each other in secret.

160
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:37,951
They were having an affair!

161
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,715
I was totally oblivious.

162
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:54,509
I was even planning
on asking her to marry me.

163
00:18:56,511 --> 00:19:00,890
The woman I truly loved,
the man I called my best friend,

164
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:02,642
everything about them was a lie.

165
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:08,523
Yura was just a puppet for that bastard,

166
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,152
only to meet a tragic end.

167
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:15,613
I knew he had a side chick.

168
00:19:17,032 --> 00:19:18,742
But I never imagined it'd be Yura.

169
00:19:21,536 --> 00:19:23,204
It just doesn't make sense.

170
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:25,373
Why would he have her make moves on you?

171
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:29,461
Human trial research files
for the smart patch.

172
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:32,630
He had Yura steal them from me.

173
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:37,177
The research was in the final stages
of sample work.

174
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:42,515
Did the smart patch succeed
in human trials?

175
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,895
I was working on it by myself.

176
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:51,358
If it weren't for Red's side effects,
I would've told you guys sooner.

177
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:55,904
And you're sure Yura took it?

178
00:19:56,988 --> 00:19:59,240
Maybe you still have it.
Did you check thoroughly?

179
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:04,037
I said Jang Dojin took it!

180
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,413
I saw everything.

181
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:09,876
That fucker's going to serve up
our company to his father any minute now!

182
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:13,838
We've both been completely fucked over
by that bastard Jang Dojin!

183
00:20:13,922 --> 00:20:15,048
Wait-- Wait!

184
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:17,759
I need to think.

185
00:20:21,471 --> 00:20:23,264
Yeah, you do that.

186
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:27,018
And I'll do what I have to.

187
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:56,339
SECOND SON OF MAJOR CORP CHAIRMAN
STEALS FROM RISING IT COMPANY

188
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:57,966
SALACIOUS LIFE OF CORP HEIR
LOVER COMMITS SUICIDE

189
00:20:58,049 --> 00:20:59,050
HEIR AND ANCHORWOMAN'S
SHAM MARRIAGE

190
00:20:59,134 --> 00:21:00,552
WHO IS THIS?
OBVIOUSLY HATCH'S JANG DOJIN

191
00:21:00,635 --> 00:21:02,012
HE SLEPT WITH PYO'S SIS-IN-LAW?

192
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:03,430
PYO BETTER DROP OUT OF THE RACE

193
00:21:03,513 --> 00:21:05,015
CANCEL HATCH
SELLING HATCH STOCKS NOW

194
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:06,349
HE CAN'T EVEN KEEP FAMILY
IN CHECK

195
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:07,851
-Come out!
-Open the door!

196
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:09,227
-Open up!
-What the hell?

197
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:12,564
You admit to your affair with Hong Yura?

198
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:16,568
Don't tell me you barged in here
just to ask that?

199
00:21:16,651 --> 00:21:19,904
If you came to the station,
this would've been much quieter, huh?

200
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:24,367
These are Miss Hong's text and call logs.

201
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:27,662
You were quite affectionate with Miss Hong
until very recently.

202
00:21:28,246 --> 00:21:30,123
But she's ended up killing herself.

203
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:32,709
You had a big argument with her
before her death?

204
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:35,128
You actually threatened to kill her.

205
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:39,632
It seems the police still resorts
to accusing people without evidence.

206
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:41,259
Because of the lightning,

207
00:21:41,343 --> 00:21:44,471
the town house system went down,
so there's no security footage.

208
00:21:44,554 --> 00:21:46,181
Fortunately, there's a witness.

209
00:21:47,474 --> 00:21:48,933
Wh-- What witness?

210
00:21:49,017 --> 00:21:50,477
Director Koo Sungchan.

211
00:21:51,686 --> 00:21:53,938
They were engaged to be married.

212
00:21:54,689 --> 00:21:57,692
You stole your best friend's woman? Damn.

213
00:22:01,446 --> 00:22:02,447
Sungchan!

214
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:06,326
Sungchan!

215
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:07,952
Sungchan.

216
00:22:10,955 --> 00:22:12,082
Sungchan.

217
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:14,668
You-- You misunderstand.

218
00:22:14,751 --> 00:22:17,253
It's true we were dating for a while,

219
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:19,130
but had I known about you two,

220
00:22:19,214 --> 00:22:21,424
I would've dumped her-- No.

221
00:22:21,508 --> 00:22:22,842
I was done with her already--

222
00:22:22,926 --> 00:22:24,886
So what?

223
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:27,097
What do you want me to say?

224
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:31,267
Hey, if you're a normal
fucking human being,

225
00:22:31,351 --> 00:22:33,478
shouldn't you show some remorse?

226
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:35,480
Apparently you threatened her.

227
00:22:36,231 --> 00:22:38,274
She told me everything before she died.

228
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:41,111
So you're the one who killed her.

229
00:22:41,736 --> 00:22:43,488
You killed her!

230
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:48,702
You completely took advantage
of the woman I loved.

231
00:22:49,703 --> 00:22:53,623
Then you just threw her away,
and you dare say--

232
00:22:53,707 --> 00:22:55,458
I took advantage of her?

233
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:57,127
That's not fair at all.

234
00:22:58,003 --> 00:23:01,131
I mean--
I was struggling because of Haesoo.

235
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:02,215
That's why Yura--

236
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:07,053
No, this is all my fault.

237
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:11,057
I should've made a clean break.

238
00:23:11,141 --> 00:23:12,392
But you couldn't.

239
00:23:15,145 --> 00:23:17,272
My sister-in-law was your mistress?

240
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:21,484
You two were at it right under our noses.

241
00:23:22,152 --> 00:23:23,820
What the hell were you thinking?

242
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,115
Jaehyun, I'll explain every--

243
00:23:27,198 --> 00:23:29,409
She was the only family Taera had left.

244
00:23:29,492 --> 00:23:31,369
And now she's dead.

245
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:32,871
You realize what you've done?

246
00:23:32,954 --> 00:23:35,081
Yes, it's driving me absolutely insane!

247
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:36,750
Why has it come to this?

248
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:40,545
Guys, please hear me out, okay?

249
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:45,175
You've really done it this time,
to me, Sungchan, Taera, and Haesoo.

250
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:50,472
You made fools out of all of us, damn it!

251
00:23:59,856 --> 00:24:02,108
We're holding a shareholders' meeting.

252
00:24:02,192 --> 00:24:04,652
We'll be discussing
your qualifications as CEO.

253
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:08,907
Hey, Jaehyun.

254
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:12,452
You're not telling me to leave Hatch
or anything like that, right?

255
00:24:12,535 --> 00:24:14,329
Didn't think it through, did you?

256
00:24:15,622 --> 00:24:17,457
You disappoint me, Dojin.

257
00:24:24,714 --> 00:24:25,715
Hey.

258
00:24:26,424 --> 00:24:30,261
Are you trying to secure the bag
in the midst of all this? Wow.

259
00:24:30,345 --> 00:24:32,055
Leeching off everything you can, huh?

260
00:24:32,847 --> 00:24:34,599
Damn, you parasite.

261
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,115
Think they'll divorce?

262
00:24:50,198 --> 00:24:51,783
The marriage is a sham anyway.

263
00:24:51,866 --> 00:24:55,787
You never know. Her rich in-laws
might offer her a hefty sum.

264
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:57,706
Wow. The largest alimony of all time.

265
00:24:57,789 --> 00:24:59,874
500 billion won? One trillion?

266
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:02,043
To the victor go the spoils.

267
00:25:02,127 --> 00:25:05,338
Does this mean her special is canceled?

268
00:25:05,422 --> 00:25:07,090
Family and friends are grieving.

269
00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:08,466
-Hey--
-Timing is terrible.

270
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:10,844
This makes for a fine Roman holiday.

271
00:25:11,344 --> 00:25:13,513
Wonder who'll replace Ko
for eight o'clock news.

272
00:25:13,596 --> 00:25:15,223
-Oh, my--
-No, not you.

273
00:25:15,306 --> 00:25:16,725
Ask me yourself.

274
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:22,856
I'm not getting divorced,
so forget the largest alimony of all time.

275
00:25:23,648 --> 00:25:26,568
I wasn't aware of this rumor
that our marriage was a sham.

276
00:25:27,736 --> 00:25:31,072
The special will air as planned,
so be sure we're well-prepared.

277
00:25:32,741 --> 00:25:35,535
-And stop worrying about me.
-Oh, okay.

278
00:25:39,664 --> 00:25:42,417
You really going to stay married
to that scum?

279
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,627
None of your business. Watch your tongue.

280
00:25:44,711 --> 00:25:46,546
What are you thinking, Haesoo?

281
00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:48,798
People are telling Pyo to drop out.

282
00:25:48,882 --> 00:25:51,968
His campaign's gone down the drain.
What election special?

283
00:25:52,927 --> 00:25:54,846
It's happening. It has to.

284
00:25:59,851 --> 00:26:03,396
You can't govern a nation
if you can't manage your own family.

285
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,648
This is obviously a competency issue.

286
00:26:06,358 --> 00:26:09,778
Apparently, Hatch partners have concerns
about the future.

287
00:26:09,861 --> 00:26:12,697
I certainly look forward
to how Pyo will react.

288
00:26:12,781 --> 00:26:15,408
Would he stay in a fight
he knows he's going to lose?

289
00:26:15,492 --> 00:26:19,496
It's obvious what he should do.
Drop out of the race.

290
00:26:21,706 --> 00:26:24,834
How you write your articles
at times like these

291
00:26:25,502 --> 00:26:28,546
determines the future of the nation, no?

292
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:32,175
WELL-PREPARED NO. 1
IN HAN KYUNGROK WE TRUST

293
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:33,927
PYO'S SIS-IN-LAW ENDS LIFE
OVER BREAKUP

294
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:35,428
"KEEP YOUR FAMILY IN CHECK, PYO"

295
00:26:38,139 --> 00:26:40,850
The situation's worse
than we expected, sir.

296
00:26:41,976 --> 00:26:45,021
The Korean Democratic Party
is working fast with the press.

297
00:26:45,105 --> 00:26:48,108
We have to respond in kind immediately.

298
00:26:48,191 --> 00:26:49,192
Wait.

299
00:26:52,404 --> 00:26:53,738
Give me some time.

300
00:26:56,032 --> 00:26:57,242
Yes, sir. Apologies.

301
00:26:58,076 --> 00:26:59,411
You must be overwhelmed.

302
00:27:01,162 --> 00:27:02,789
Okay, everybody. Come on.

303
00:27:13,591 --> 00:27:16,219
Think, Pyo Jaehyun. What's the next move?

304
00:27:24,978 --> 00:27:26,604
ANCHORWOMAN KO HAESOO

305
00:27:37,115 --> 00:27:38,908
Thought you might need this.

306
00:27:42,579 --> 00:27:46,458
We've known each other for a long time,
but I've never seen you like this.

307
00:27:46,541 --> 00:27:49,210
I can't figure out what went wrong.

308
00:27:51,046 --> 00:27:54,466
I'm not even sure if I can fix it.

309
00:27:55,508 --> 00:27:57,844
I know how you can fix it.

310
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:01,806
My special.

311
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:03,683
What?

312
00:28:04,893 --> 00:28:06,770
Now's not the time to hide but to show up.

313
00:28:06,853 --> 00:28:08,897
Hatch's anxious shareholders,

314
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:11,900
supporters willing to entrust you
with the future,

315
00:28:11,983 --> 00:28:13,651
show them what they want.

316
00:28:14,486 --> 00:28:18,073
Show them who you are
and what kind of world you want to create.

317
00:28:20,408 --> 00:28:22,077
If you make an appearance with Taera,

318
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,329
you can turn this crisis
into an opportunity.

319
00:28:27,207 --> 00:28:28,333
Trust me, Jaehyun.

320
00:28:37,384 --> 00:28:41,971
Miss Hong Yura felt quite torn
between Mr. Koo and Mr. Jang.

321
00:28:42,055 --> 00:28:44,516
Mr. Jang confirmed his affair with her.

322
00:28:45,517 --> 00:28:46,518
I see.

323
00:28:47,477 --> 00:28:50,397
An autopsy may be unnecessary
at this point.

324
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,774
I don't want to torment her
after death either.

325
00:28:54,067 --> 00:28:55,068
Forget the autopsy.

326
00:28:55,694 --> 00:29:00,115
Your late sister must've
wanted to hear your voice one last time.

327
00:29:00,782 --> 00:29:03,201
It's unfortunate you never picked up.

328
00:29:03,702 --> 00:29:06,538
I saw that she left a voice message.
What did she say?

329
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:11,001
-I haven't been able to--
-I understand.

330
00:29:11,084 --> 00:29:14,421
Death in the family
can make you feel out of sorts.

331
00:29:14,504 --> 00:29:17,090
One moment. I'll get you her belongings.

332
00:29:28,101 --> 00:29:29,894
To hear your messages, press 1.

333
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:07,182
I'd like to be alone for a while.

334
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:03,071
That's what you wanted to tell me

335
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,865
before you took your last breath?

336
00:31:13,873 --> 00:31:15,625
I still can't forgive you.

337
00:31:27,971 --> 00:31:28,972
Farewell,

338
00:31:29,889 --> 00:31:30,890
Yura.

339
00:32:23,109 --> 00:32:24,652
I feel so sorry for Yura.

340
00:32:26,863 --> 00:32:29,199
Thank you for coming all this way.

341
00:32:30,033 --> 00:32:32,035
I know you didn't want to be here.

342
00:32:33,912 --> 00:32:36,039
If you're really thankful,
let me interview you.

343
00:32:36,122 --> 00:32:38,625
You can do that for me,
given our history, right?

344
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,841
You're heartless.

345
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:50,929
I was willing to do anything for you.

346
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:54,224
Fine, let's do it.

347
00:32:55,433 --> 00:32:57,018
With Jaehyun by my side.

348
00:32:59,938 --> 00:33:00,939
Really?

349
00:33:03,149 --> 00:33:04,192
Aren't you scared?

350
00:33:04,275 --> 00:33:06,486
You never liked making public appearances.

351
00:33:08,571 --> 00:33:10,240
I can't avoid it anymore.

352
00:33:12,242 --> 00:33:13,785
I don't want to hide either.

353
00:33:15,704 --> 00:33:17,747
I guess I didn't know you at all.

354
00:33:19,582 --> 00:33:20,792
You are…

355
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:25,922
much cleverer and more ambitious
than I thought.

356
00:33:31,594 --> 00:33:34,389
Have you dreamt of becoming the first lady
for some time?

357
00:33:36,641 --> 00:33:37,892
Do I seem like I have?

358
00:33:39,561 --> 00:33:41,187
I look forward to the interview.

359
00:33:43,606 --> 00:33:44,607
Me too.

360
00:34:06,212 --> 00:34:07,213
Hey…

361
00:34:11,259 --> 00:34:12,260
I'm sorry.

362
00:34:13,094 --> 00:34:14,721
I'm so ashamed.

363
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,600
It's all my fault. I'm sorry, Haesoo.

364
00:34:20,643 --> 00:34:22,854
Do you really think Yura's death
was a suicide?

365
00:34:24,022 --> 00:34:26,524
Wait. Are you suspecting me?

366
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:28,985
I really ended things with her.

367
00:34:29,486 --> 00:34:32,655
But she wouldn't let go,
and she was seeing Sungchan all this--

368
00:34:34,032 --> 00:34:36,493
She-- She just used me the whole time.

369
00:34:37,243 --> 00:34:38,244
I think so too.

370
00:34:39,162 --> 00:34:42,040
I think she made moves on you
with an ulterior motive.

371
00:34:42,624 --> 00:34:44,084
To ruin your reputation.

372
00:34:48,254 --> 00:34:51,383
What would she have gained by doing that?

373
00:34:53,259 --> 00:34:55,303
What if she was following orders?

374
00:34:55,387 --> 00:34:57,972
Someone who brought her
to this town house.

375
00:34:59,265 --> 00:35:01,726
Someone who ordered her to approach you.

376
00:35:02,977 --> 00:35:05,563
Someone who killed Hong Yura

377
00:35:06,189 --> 00:35:07,982
to cover up everything.

378
00:35:10,402 --> 00:35:11,403
Who would that be?

379
00:35:14,572 --> 00:35:17,617
Taera never shed a tear.

380
00:35:18,827 --> 00:35:21,496
She lost her beloved, one and only sister.

381
00:35:23,665 --> 00:35:24,958
Yet she doesn't seem sad.

382
00:35:46,062 --> 00:35:47,605
Jiu finally fell asleep.

383
00:35:51,901 --> 00:35:53,361
Why are you looking at this?

384
00:35:54,529 --> 00:35:56,114
Yura once asked me

385
00:35:56,865 --> 00:36:00,452
if I've ever been unhappy,
even for a second.

386
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:06,791
Now that I think about it,
I've been very happy with you.

387
00:36:07,375 --> 00:36:09,252
My life felt like a dream.

388
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,175
I told Haesoo

389
00:36:16,259 --> 00:36:19,095
that we'll go on the election special.

390
00:36:19,179 --> 00:36:20,930
You're really going to do it?

391
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:26,478
It was a difficult decision for you
to run in the election,

392
00:36:27,979 --> 00:36:30,315
and I've been so selfish lately.

393
00:36:32,359 --> 00:36:33,526
I'm sorry, honey.

394
00:36:34,527 --> 00:36:35,570
Taera…

395
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,281
From now on,

396
00:36:38,823 --> 00:36:40,700
feel free to discuss anything with me.

397
00:36:42,285 --> 00:36:45,288
I'll do whatever I can to help you.

398
00:36:48,458 --> 00:36:50,418
You're all I have left.

399
00:36:52,629 --> 00:36:53,838
Thank you, Taera.

400
00:37:51,813 --> 00:37:53,857
This is from Yura's pearl necklace.

401
00:37:54,858 --> 00:37:56,985
To celebrate the opening of your boutique.

402
00:37:58,862 --> 00:38:00,321
Someone murdered her,

403
00:38:01,364 --> 00:38:04,784
and if what she told me is actually true…

404
00:38:24,846 --> 00:38:25,847
Pilseung?

405
00:38:30,935 --> 00:38:32,145
My apologies, Ms. Hong.

406
00:38:33,021 --> 00:38:35,398
I saw a light and thought it was a thief.

407
00:38:35,482 --> 00:38:36,816
No, it's fine.

408
00:38:38,193 --> 00:38:39,194
I'm also sorry

409
00:38:40,236 --> 00:38:41,363
about the other day.

410
00:38:42,906 --> 00:38:45,283
I got too worked up
at the thought that I'd lost Jiu.

411
00:38:46,284 --> 00:38:49,454
You have a lot on your mind.
No need to worry about me, ma'am.

412
00:38:51,331 --> 00:38:53,583
But what were you doing here?

413
00:38:55,543 --> 00:38:57,170
I was just looking for something.

414
00:38:57,837 --> 00:38:58,838
It's nothing.

415
00:38:58,922 --> 00:39:01,466
Is your sister's death really a suicide?

416
00:39:04,594 --> 00:39:06,346
Why did you say it like that?

417
00:39:06,429 --> 00:39:09,641
I saw someone suspicious
near the dock that night.

418
00:39:09,724 --> 00:39:11,476
-I was wondering--
-Who did you see?

419
00:39:12,644 --> 00:39:15,063
He looked like the man at the library.

420
00:39:16,731 --> 00:39:18,233
I took a photo just in case.

421
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:22,070
Uhm Sangbae?

422
00:39:22,654 --> 00:39:25,198
What about this person?
Did you see their face?

423
00:39:25,281 --> 00:39:26,658
No, I didn't.

424
00:39:30,286 --> 00:39:31,830
Can you send this to me?

425
00:39:31,913 --> 00:39:33,206
Yes, ma'am.

426
00:39:47,012 --> 00:39:49,973
The provisional shareholders'
meeting will begin shortly.

427
00:39:50,056 --> 00:39:52,892
All attendees may enter
the conference room at this time.

428
00:39:57,063 --> 00:39:58,481
Move, you bastard.

429
00:39:58,565 --> 00:40:01,693
This is the company that I built.
You forget I invested first?

430
00:40:01,776 --> 00:40:04,904
-I can't give up like this--
-It's already decided.

431
00:40:04,988 --> 00:40:07,449
You want to be dragged out?
Is that what you want?

432
00:40:07,532 --> 00:40:11,494
-Then what am I supposed to do?
-It's not easy for me to say this either!

433
00:40:11,578 --> 00:40:13,997
For now, let's do what's best for Hatch.
Please!

434
00:40:14,914 --> 00:40:18,126
To restore the company's reputation,
it's best you leave.

435
00:40:18,209 --> 00:40:19,794
Hey, Jaehyun.

436
00:40:20,295 --> 00:40:24,716
You-- You of all people know
what Hatch means to me.

437
00:40:25,467 --> 00:40:27,344
Then why did you act so recklessly?

438
00:40:28,261 --> 00:40:29,637
We're not at Kumjo.

439
00:40:30,638 --> 00:40:33,850
You deal with crisis management
as the heir of a business titan.

440
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:40,106
If you want, I'll take care of your shares
right away, based on today's stock price.

441
00:40:54,371 --> 00:40:55,997
HATCH CEO JANG DOJIN
RESIGNS DISHONORABLY

442
00:40:56,081 --> 00:40:57,374
HATCH TO OUTSOURCE MANAGEMENT

443
00:40:57,457 --> 00:40:59,501
It's what's best for Hatch.

444
00:41:00,543 --> 00:41:04,214
Is that what Pyo Jaehyun told you to say?

445
00:41:06,299 --> 00:41:11,471
I warned you not to let him
push you around, and yet--

446
00:41:12,472 --> 00:41:13,640
This is why

447
00:41:14,182 --> 00:41:19,229
you can't even beat your brother,
who's comatose and can't lift a finger.

448
00:41:20,271 --> 00:41:22,524
What? Don't want to hear the hard truth?

449
00:41:24,484 --> 00:41:27,529
Let's get you ready
to be my successor at Kumjo.

450
00:41:28,613 --> 00:41:29,614
No, thank you.

451
00:41:30,323 --> 00:41:31,324
What did you say?

452
00:41:31,408 --> 00:41:33,743
I told you, Kyojin is your successor.

453
00:41:33,827 --> 00:41:35,704
Get a hold of yourself.

454
00:41:36,246 --> 00:41:39,624
I don't need you to hold onto futile hope,
like your mother.

455
00:41:41,292 --> 00:41:43,795
After all,
Kyojin isn't even actually a Jang.

456
00:41:43,878 --> 00:41:46,214
-Father!
-What? Am I wrong?

457
00:41:46,297 --> 00:41:50,510
It makes no sense to give Kumjo
to someone of a different family line.

458
00:41:50,593 --> 00:41:53,596
Mother was the heiress of
Kumjo Pharmaceuticals in the first place.

459
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:57,767
If nothing had happened to Kyojin,
he'd be the one to succeed you.

460
00:41:57,851 --> 00:42:01,604
I know you're in a loveless marriage,
but don't you feel sorry for Mother?

461
00:42:01,688 --> 00:42:04,649
Feel sorry?

462
00:42:09,446 --> 00:42:12,323
Kumjo Group is where it is today,
all thanks to me.

463
00:42:12,407 --> 00:42:14,534
I was forced to marry
a widow with a child!

464
00:42:14,617 --> 00:42:18,872
The only reason I stayed quiet was
because of the stocks under Kyojin's name.

465
00:42:18,955 --> 00:42:22,000
Seven years? I've waited long enough.

466
00:42:22,083 --> 00:42:23,335
So now…

467
00:42:24,794 --> 00:42:26,338
you'll do as I say.

468
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:33,011
Come in.

469
00:42:36,723 --> 00:42:38,183
As I said earlier,

470
00:42:39,059 --> 00:42:40,643
settle Kyojin's shares.

471
00:42:40,727 --> 00:42:41,728
Yes, sir.

472
00:42:42,896 --> 00:42:46,399
Wh-- Do you want to give Mother
a heart attack?

473
00:42:46,483 --> 00:42:48,443
I've made it very clear.

474
00:42:48,526 --> 00:42:51,154
I won't come back to Kumjo.

475
00:42:51,905 --> 00:42:55,116
That's for me to decide.

476
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,201
You just…

477
00:42:57,452 --> 00:42:59,662
reclaim your place at Hatch

478
00:43:01,539 --> 00:43:02,791
and bring it to Kumjo.

479
00:43:05,001 --> 00:43:06,002
What?

480
00:43:06,086 --> 00:43:10,423
You thought I'd let you return to Kumjo
empty-handed?

481
00:43:26,022 --> 00:43:29,109
Kyojin hasn't changed a bit.

482
00:43:30,568 --> 00:43:32,070
He doesn't age.

483
00:43:33,279 --> 00:43:34,906
He looks even better.

484
00:43:36,366 --> 00:43:38,952
Everyone must be in shock
because of Dojin.

485
00:43:39,869 --> 00:43:41,830
What on earth was he thinking?

486
00:43:42,914 --> 00:43:44,958
You know he's always been that way.

487
00:43:45,041 --> 00:43:46,292
That bastard.

488
00:43:56,219 --> 00:43:57,220
Ms. Min,

489
00:43:58,722 --> 00:44:03,685
there's something I never told you
about Kyojin's accident seven years ago.

490
00:44:05,687 --> 00:44:07,188
You obviously know

491
00:44:07,772 --> 00:44:10,316
that Kyojin always
worked on his bike himself.

492
00:44:13,111 --> 00:44:14,904
But, strangely enough, that day,

493
00:44:16,281 --> 00:44:18,616
I saw Dojin working on Kyojin's bike,

494
00:44:19,409 --> 00:44:20,493
right before the race.

495
00:44:30,962 --> 00:44:32,839
-Hey!
-Whoa.

496
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,759
What are you doing? Huh?

497
00:44:35,842 --> 00:44:40,305
Something's wrong with Kyojin's bike.
The brakes aren't working well.

498
00:44:40,388 --> 00:44:43,516
Hey, he probably checked them himself.

499
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:45,018
You know he's a perfectionist.

500
00:44:46,019 --> 00:44:49,522
It doesn't hurt to be extra cautious.
The road's slippery too.

501
00:44:50,273 --> 00:44:52,901
Besides, I'm in charge of the equipment.

502
00:44:54,069 --> 00:44:55,070
Hard at work, huh?

503
00:44:59,532 --> 00:45:01,326
Dojin, that bastard,

504
00:45:02,077 --> 00:45:05,622
tampered with Kyojin's breaks on purpose,

505
00:45:06,456 --> 00:45:09,959
and that's why Kyojin crashed.

506
00:45:12,003 --> 00:45:16,299
Ms. Min, I'm so sorry
I'm telling you this now.

507
00:45:20,261 --> 00:45:21,388
Ms. Min!

508
00:45:23,598 --> 00:45:25,141
So it was Dojin after all.

509
00:45:29,312 --> 00:45:30,313
I'm so sorry.

510
00:45:31,773 --> 00:45:34,484
Sorry for finding out so late, Kyojin.

511
00:45:34,567 --> 00:45:37,278
I don't deserve your forgiveness, Kyojin!

512
00:45:37,362 --> 00:45:39,656
Kyojin! Kyojin!

513
00:45:41,616 --> 00:45:43,034
Oh!

514
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:45,829
Ms. Min, are you okay?

515
00:45:46,413 --> 00:45:47,414
Ms. Eun!

516
00:45:47,497 --> 00:45:51,042
-Here, over here!
-Ma'am. Ma'am!

517
00:45:58,008 --> 00:46:02,470
At times like these,
I believe we need to do the unexpected.

518
00:46:02,554 --> 00:46:07,684
Let's divert the attention from Mr. Pyo
to Ms. Taera Hong.

519
00:46:08,309 --> 00:46:12,897
Something spectacular to make
her first impression unforgettable.

520
00:46:12,981 --> 00:46:16,276
I truly believe this is important.

521
00:46:21,114 --> 00:46:22,282
Ms. Taera Hong.

522
00:46:23,074 --> 00:46:24,367
She's from France.

523
00:46:24,451 --> 00:46:30,081
She's a certified baker, and she knows
Korean, Italian, even Chinese cuisines.

524
00:46:30,665 --> 00:46:35,712
To top it off, just look at the plating.
What works of art.

525
00:46:35,795 --> 00:46:40,008
You know, people are secretly fascinated
by the wealthy.

526
00:46:40,091 --> 00:46:43,720
You know how we yell at the TV
when we watch shows?

527
00:46:43,803 --> 00:46:44,804
But, one day,

528
00:46:45,597 --> 00:46:48,391
you feel like this wealthy housewife
is your bestie!

529
00:46:48,475 --> 00:46:51,269
It's going to blow them away!

530
00:46:51,353 --> 00:46:56,024
Just imagine, Ms. Taera Hong going
to the gym in leggings and a sweatshirt,

531
00:46:56,107 --> 00:46:57,650
carrying a designer bag.

532
00:46:57,734 --> 00:47:01,404
Posting selfies at the gym on
social media, showing your authentic self!

533
00:47:01,488 --> 00:47:03,198
Your daily life as a wealthy housewife!

534
00:47:03,281 --> 00:47:06,493
Very casually, let's just show it all!

535
00:47:06,576 --> 00:47:08,119
Wh-- What do you think?

536
00:47:08,203 --> 00:47:09,329
Take a sip of water.

537
00:47:10,455 --> 00:47:11,956
Okay, thank you.

538
00:47:14,084 --> 00:47:16,252
I'll just do what I've always been doing.

539
00:47:17,003 --> 00:47:19,297
I don't like awkward,
uncomfortable situations.

540
00:47:20,423 --> 00:47:23,677
I just want to help my husband.
That's all.

541
00:47:24,552 --> 00:47:27,305
Oh, I like how you think.

542
00:47:27,389 --> 00:47:30,100
Why, thank you.
I blabbed for no reason.

543
00:47:30,934 --> 00:47:34,270
That's all right.
It's what I'm getting paid for anyway.

544
00:47:34,354 --> 00:47:37,649
Well, what's next on the itinerary then?

I'll show you all

Why'd you ask to see me?

553
00:48:17,605 --> 00:48:21,067
You can discuss the smart patch
human trials with Director Koo.

554
00:48:21,568 --> 00:48:25,864
Don't worry about the human trials.
Everything will work out just fine.

555
00:48:26,656 --> 00:48:30,285
After all, Hanwool and Hatch
are in this together, aren't we?

556
00:48:32,412 --> 00:48:33,413
Then what?

557
00:48:37,834 --> 00:48:41,379
I thought I'd be here forever.

558
00:48:41,463 --> 00:48:43,048
DIRECTOR KIM SEONDEOK

559
00:48:43,131 --> 00:48:48,887
Human greed knows no bounds, Chairman.

560
00:48:50,221 --> 00:48:51,639
No.

561
00:48:51,723 --> 00:48:55,352
I assume that's why you've decided
to run for president as well.

562
00:48:57,771 --> 00:49:00,065
What are you trying to say?

563
00:49:02,609 --> 00:49:06,946
I will make you President Pyo Jaehyun.

564
00:49:09,991 --> 00:49:11,368
How about a partnership?

565
00:49:13,578 --> 00:49:16,164
You must have something
that can destroy me.

566
00:49:27,967 --> 00:49:29,719
It's all set, Chairman.

567
00:49:32,389 --> 00:49:33,556
What about my wife?

568
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:35,392
It's done, as you instructed.

569
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:47,612
If you've made up your mind,
I'll do it myself.

570
00:49:48,655 --> 00:49:49,656
No.

571
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:54,327
I should finish him with my own hands.

572
00:49:57,205 --> 00:49:59,165
I raised him, after all.

573
00:50:00,375 --> 00:50:02,043
I was a father figure to him.

574
00:50:29,612 --> 00:50:32,032
Ma'am, are you awake now?

575
00:50:32,115 --> 00:50:33,575
It'll be just a little prick.

576
00:50:56,765 --> 00:50:58,767
After all I'd done to steal Kumjo,

577
00:50:59,809 --> 00:51:01,936
I can't have you take it back.

578
00:51:04,856 --> 00:51:06,775
I hope you understand, Kyojin.

579
00:51:12,238 --> 00:51:14,616
Why did you have to be so perfect?

580
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:20,580
I'll catch up with you soon.

581
00:51:21,373 --> 00:51:22,499
When I do…

582
00:51:24,668 --> 00:51:26,544
you can resent me all you want.

583
00:51:35,804 --> 00:51:37,305
You've suffered enough.

584
00:51:54,781 --> 00:51:56,783
HANWOOL MENTAL HOSPITAL

585
00:52:08,128 --> 00:52:09,295
Ms. Min.

586
00:52:09,379 --> 00:52:11,297
Oh, my. Jaehyun!

587
00:52:11,381 --> 00:52:13,675
What happened? What are you doing here?

588
00:52:13,758 --> 00:52:16,469
Jaehyun, please save Kyojin.

589
00:52:16,553 --> 00:52:18,346
Please save my son Kyojin. Please!

00:52:32,152 --> 00:52:33,987
POWER

591
00:52:46,666 --> 00:52:48,001
What are you doing here?

592
00:52:49,419 --> 00:52:51,171
Was this your plan all along?

593
00:52:51,796 --> 00:52:54,507
Did you think I'd be grateful to you?

594
00:52:55,175 --> 00:52:56,176
How--

595
00:52:56,676 --> 00:52:58,970
How can you even think of killing Kyojin?

596
00:52:59,054 --> 00:53:00,263
Back off!

597
00:53:00,930 --> 00:53:02,682
Someone has to make the tough call.

598
00:53:02,766 --> 00:53:04,184
Don't press that button!

599
00:53:04,267 --> 00:53:06,061
If you do, I'll end my own life.

600
00:53:06,144 --> 00:53:08,104
Did I not tell you to be brutal?

601
00:53:08,188 --> 00:53:11,316
You have to be brutal to sustain Kumjo!

602
00:53:11,399 --> 00:53:14,694
I will never go back to Kumjo.

603
00:53:15,403 --> 00:53:18,990
And if you send Mother
to that hospital ever again,

604
00:53:19,074 --> 00:53:20,825
you and I are done.

605
00:53:20,909 --> 00:53:22,660
What does she even mean to you?

606
00:53:23,161 --> 00:53:25,080
You can try as you might,

607
00:53:25,163 --> 00:53:27,665
but she will never see you
as her real son.

608
00:53:28,249 --> 00:53:30,085
The only real family you have

609
00:53:30,669 --> 00:53:31,670
is your father.

610
00:53:34,964 --> 00:53:36,341
Only me.

611
00:53:40,762 --> 00:53:43,848
Don't ever lay your hands on Mother
or Kyojin again,

612
00:53:45,016 --> 00:53:47,143
if you really don't want to lose me.

613
00:54:07,372 --> 00:54:08,707
Kyojin is safe.

614
00:54:09,249 --> 00:54:11,710
Dojin stopped it just in time.

615
00:54:12,794 --> 00:54:15,255
Thank you, Jaehyun. Thank you so much.

616
00:54:15,338 --> 00:54:17,340
I'll return the favor, I promise.

617
00:54:17,424 --> 00:54:20,885
There's no need.
Kyojin is like a brother to me.

618
00:54:21,970 --> 00:54:24,264
Dojin will be here soon,
so get some rest, Ms. Min.

619
00:54:25,807 --> 00:54:27,142
You think it's safe here?

620
00:54:27,976 --> 00:54:30,395
Who knows what my husband
has up his sleeve?

621
00:54:33,565 --> 00:54:35,692
There is a way

622
00:54:36,943 --> 00:54:37,944
to wake Kyojin up.

623
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:39,821
Really?

624
00:54:40,613 --> 00:54:41,614
Do you mean it?

625
00:54:43,033 --> 00:54:44,284
Will you trust me?

626
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:48,329
You're the only one I can trust
right now, Jaehyun.

627
00:54:48,413 --> 00:54:50,040
It doesn't matter how.

628
00:54:50,123 --> 00:54:53,585
If you can save Kyojin,
I'll give you everything I have.

629
00:54:59,758 --> 00:55:01,009
Here comes Dojin.

630
00:55:07,349 --> 00:55:09,726
Kyojin is fine.
Don't worry, Mother.

631
00:55:13,646 --> 00:55:15,148
You shameless bastard.

632
00:55:15,231 --> 00:55:16,816
You knew all along, didn't you?

633
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:19,277
Did you plan this with your father?

634
00:55:19,361 --> 00:55:23,323
How can you do this to your own brother?
You know how much he cared for you.

635
00:55:24,032 --> 00:55:25,283
That's not what happened.

636
00:55:25,367 --> 00:55:27,327
-I just--
-Kumjo belongs to Kyojin.

637
00:55:28,161 --> 00:55:31,164
It's not meant for someone
as pathetic and lousy as you.

638
00:55:33,583 --> 00:55:37,379
I have no intention of taking Kumjo.
Even if it were free, I wouldn't want it.

639
00:55:37,462 --> 00:55:39,297
That's why I worked at Hatch.

640
00:55:43,259 --> 00:55:45,929
-Let's go inside, Mother--
-Don't call me your mother.

641
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:50,642
I've never thought of you as my son,
not even once.

642
00:55:58,775 --> 00:55:59,776
Come on, Ms. Min.

643
00:56:07,450 --> 00:56:08,451
Not…

644
00:56:09,577 --> 00:56:10,578
even once?

645
00:56:14,165 --> 00:56:16,042
So I'm not a son to you.

646
00:56:26,136 --> 00:56:30,181
Emergency! Emergency! It's urgent!

647
00:56:30,265 --> 00:56:32,225
Emergency meeting right away!

648
00:56:33,101 --> 00:56:35,145
-Geez.
-Did something happen?

649
00:56:36,354 --> 00:56:37,397
Anchorwoman Ko,

650
00:56:38,148 --> 00:56:41,026
I'd heard things about her,
but she's something else.

651
00:56:41,109 --> 00:56:42,485
Well, what happened?

652
00:56:42,569 --> 00:56:46,573
She's getting her clothes custom-made
for the election special.

653
00:56:46,656 --> 00:56:48,366
This is an absolute brouhaha!

654
00:56:48,450 --> 00:56:51,578
At this rate, she's going to catch up
to Ms. Taera Hong.

655
00:56:51,661 --> 00:56:54,831
It's only a matter of time, isn't it?

656
00:56:54,914 --> 00:56:56,291
That's it.

657
00:56:57,417 --> 00:57:01,880
Please gather everyone in this house
immediately.

658
00:57:01,963 --> 00:57:05,258
Right away! Meeting! Meeting! Meeting!

659
00:57:05,342 --> 00:57:06,343
Gather everyone.

660
00:57:11,306 --> 00:57:12,932
What do you think?

661
00:57:15,143 --> 00:57:16,311
Next one.

662
00:57:23,318 --> 00:57:25,070
Next one.

663
00:57:34,662 --> 00:57:35,872
Okay!

Pyo Jaehyun! Pyo Jaehyun! Pyo--

670
00:58:08,613 --> 00:58:10,240
Hello, Candidate Pyo.

671
00:58:10,323 --> 00:58:12,575
What an honor it is
to finally get to meet you.

672
00:58:13,159 --> 00:58:15,120
It's nice to meet you. I'm Pyo Jaehyun.

673
00:58:15,203 --> 00:58:16,246
Yes.

674
00:58:17,789 --> 00:58:22,711
Oh, my. You're so beautiful.
I almost mistook you for a celebrity.

675
00:58:22,794 --> 00:58:25,005
I'm truly amazed.

676
00:58:25,088 --> 00:58:27,757
-Don't you think so?
-I strongly agree, sir.

677
00:58:27,841 --> 00:58:29,259
Truly an honor to meet you.

678
00:58:29,342 --> 00:58:31,302
The honor's mine.

679
00:58:31,386 --> 00:58:33,722
Oh, where's Anchorwoman Ko?

680
00:58:33,805 --> 00:58:37,892
She's busy making finishing touches.

681
00:58:39,144 --> 00:58:40,520
Let's head inside.

682
00:58:55,744 --> 00:58:58,288
Ms. Ko, you're exceptionally
pretty today. Wow.

683
00:58:59,205 --> 00:59:01,332
Seriously. Something looks different.

684
00:59:02,208 --> 00:59:03,918
Hong Taera's got competition.

685
00:59:05,211 --> 00:59:07,380
-You have the outfit?
-It's all set.

686
00:59:35,325 --> 00:59:36,910
It's okay. Don't be nervous.

687
00:59:40,205 --> 00:59:41,831
-Okay, everyone ready?
-Yes, sir.

688
00:59:41,915 --> 00:59:44,417
Standby, starting in 30 seconds. Okay!

689
00:59:45,418 --> 00:59:47,045
Good luck, Anchorwoman Ko.

690
00:59:47,128 --> 00:59:48,296
You too.

691
00:59:50,465 --> 00:59:52,175
Taera, you ready?

692
00:59:53,885 --> 00:59:54,886
Yeah.

693
00:59:55,679 --> 00:59:57,681
It's going to be an unforgettable show.

694
01:00:02,852 --> 01:00:06,690
Gosh, it's so annoying
how pretty Ms. Ko is. Damn it.

695

Chief! Chief! Look at this.
Our ratings are through the roof!

701
01:00:42,642 --> 01:00:44,894
Shall we talk more about your family?

702
01:00:45,895 --> 01:00:48,982
Candidate Pyo, you've recently revealed
your daughter.

703
01:00:52,861 --> 01:00:55,196
Her name is Jiu. Pyo Jiu.
She's seven years old.

704
01:00:55,864 --> 01:00:59,117
As you can see, she's a lot to handle.

705
01:01:05,832 --> 01:01:07,500
She looks exactly like her mother.

706
01:01:10,754 --> 01:01:12,797
Looks like she plays with guns often.

707
01:01:14,174 --> 01:01:17,135
So, did you teach her yourself?

708
01:01:18,511 --> 01:01:19,596
Pardon?

709
01:01:23,683 --> 01:01:28,605
You always stood behind your husband,
perhaps to minimize exposure.

710
01:01:28,688 --> 01:01:30,190
Can you tell us why?

711
01:01:30,273 --> 01:01:32,650
Could it be because
you have a tremendous secret?

712
01:01:32,734 --> 01:01:35,737
-What's going on?
-What is this?

713
01:01:35,820 --> 01:01:38,740
Anchorwoman Ko, the questions are a bit…

714
01:01:39,783 --> 01:01:41,284
Am I making you uncomfortable?

715
01:01:41,368 --> 01:01:43,995
Think of this as a precursor
of what's to come.

716
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:47,832
After all, there might be things
about your wife you don't know yet.

717
01:01:49,125 --> 01:01:50,126
Or…

718
01:01:51,044 --> 01:01:53,380
are you just pretending you don't know?

719
01:02:00,261 --> 01:02:01,596
Wait, what's she doing?

720
01:02:02,347 --> 01:02:03,640
Well, I'm not sure.

721
01:02:03,723 --> 01:02:06,309
She keeps going off script.

722
01:02:06,393 --> 01:02:08,728
-She was fine earlier…
-Hey, what do we do?

723
01:02:11,022 --> 01:02:13,274
What exactly are you talking about?

724
01:02:24,327 --> 01:02:26,246
Taera, you know who this is, don't you?

725
01:02:26,329 --> 01:02:29,040
-My goodness.
-What's she saying?

726
01:02:29,124 --> 01:02:31,251
-She's so set on…
-What's happening?

727
01:02:31,334 --> 01:02:34,671
-What does that mean?
-Makes no sense.

728
01:02:34,754 --> 01:02:37,632
-My goodness.
-No way.

729
01:02:37,716 --> 01:02:38,883
Who on earth is she?

730
01:02:39,551 --> 01:02:42,012
The real killer
of the late President Ko Taesun.

731
01:02:42,095 --> 01:02:44,973
-What? Really?
-Former President…

732
01:02:45,056 --> 01:02:47,225
-What does that mean?
-Is that true?

733
01:02:47,308 --> 01:02:48,768
-What the--
-Wait a minute.

734
01:02:48,852 --> 01:02:51,062
-No way.
-The real killer?

735
01:02:51,146 --> 01:02:53,231
This is the assassin who killed my father.

736
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:56,901
On that day, 15 years ago,

737
01:02:58,153 --> 01:03:00,196
were you not also at the scene, Ms. Hong?

738
01:03:10,540 --> 01:03:11,916
The woman in this photo.

739
01:03:13,251 --> 01:03:15,962
The suspect who assassinated
the former President Ko.

740
01:03:17,464 --> 01:03:19,007
Is this you, Ms. Hong?

741
01:03:29,351 --> 01:03:30,643
Answer me, Hong Taera.

742
01:03:32,187 --> 01:03:33,229
Was it you

743
01:03:34,731 --> 01:03:36,149
who killed my father…

744
01:03:38,610 --> 01:03:40,820
on that day 15 years ago?

745
01:03:49,454 --> 01:03:50,830
What's with the tears?

746
01:03:51,748 --> 01:03:53,458
Are you admitting guilt?

747
01:04:02,384 --> 01:04:03,551
Tell me, Hong Taera.

748
01:04:03,635 --> 01:04:06,930
Are you No. 50,
the assassin who shot my father?

749
01:04:07,764 --> 01:04:08,890
Answer me!

750
01:04:48,388 --> 01:04:50,015
Why are you silent?

751
01:04:50,098 --> 01:04:51,599
Is this why you brought us here?

752
01:04:51,683 --> 01:04:53,935
Answer me before you go! Hong Taera!

753
01:04:54,019 --> 01:04:55,562
I let it slide, but not this time.

754
01:04:55,645 --> 01:04:57,355
You fucking lunatic--

755
01:04:57,439 --> 01:05:00,525
I'm not letting this go.
I'll unearth the truth alone if I have to.

756
01:05:01,317 --> 01:05:03,403
What is inside this flash drive?

757
01:05:03,486 --> 01:05:06,114
It's my life's research.

758
01:05:06,197 --> 01:05:08,241
You're the one who rushed the research.

759
01:05:08,324 --> 01:05:11,119
I don't trust you either.
Do you even want to save Kyojin?

760
01:05:11,202 --> 01:05:13,538
Quite a show with the "assassin."

761
01:05:13,621 --> 01:05:16,124
Probably concocted by the one
who set up your current life.

762
01:05:17,625 --> 01:05:19,002
Not Haesoo.

763
01:05:20,086 --> 01:05:21,296
Don't touch her.
