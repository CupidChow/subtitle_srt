PANDORA: BENEATH THE PARADISE

2
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:08,735
<i>Where did Ms. Hong go?</i>

3
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:12,447
Oh, she said she wasn't feeling well.
She'll be back soon.

4
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:18,620
DIRECTOR: TEXT MESSAGE

5
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:26,961
<i>Feed No. 105 to the dogs.</i>
<i>Leave no trace behind.</i>

6
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,235
All thanks to you.

7
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:01,496
- Thank you.
- Of course.

8
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,459
ELECTRICAL CONTROL PANEL

9
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:10,880
2023 BUSINESS NETWORKING EVENT

10
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,549
- What?
- What's this?

11
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:13,633
It's a blackout.

12
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,180
- Hey! Hey!
- Turn the lights on!

13
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:21,016
Turn on the lights!

14
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:24,686
- Why'd we suddenly lose power?
- What's this? What's wrong?

15
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,274
- Hello?
- Get the lights!

16
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:32,235
- The lights are off!
- Turn the emergency power on!

17
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:36,948
- Emergency power! Come on!
- Hurry up, please!

18
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,246
You!

19
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:46,249
You shouldn't have laid hands
on my brother.

20
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:52,589
Don't you dare.

21
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,391
Guess I should thank you.

22
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:07,312
Becoming No. 50 wasn't all for naught.

23
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:30,543
- What was that?
- What happened?

24
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:36,966
- Oh, my!
- What's this?

25
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,220
- No photos.
- One moment.

26
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:02,367
- Oh, no!
- Call an ambulance!

27
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,471
Where were you? I've been looking for you.

28
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:26,641
I was resting in the powder room.

29
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,435
I'm feeling tired.

30
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:44,034
Block the exits!

31
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:47,287
Nobody move until the police arrive!

32
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:50,206
- There's a murderer among us!
- A murderer?

33
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:58,173
Over there, get him! There's the culprit!

34
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:02,510
Let's go.

35
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:05,722
We have to go now.

36
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,108
My wife isn't feeling well.

37
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:19,235
We'd like to leave if you will excuse us.

38
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,529
We can't let anyone leave
until the police arrives.

39
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:23,490
This is a homicide, sir.

40
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,575
I am Pyo Jaehyun. You need to see my ID?

41
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:29,537
If the police suspects us,
we will cooperate at any time.

42
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,960
Of course, sir. Why don't you go on ahead?

43
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:37,754
Thank you.

44
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,275
<i>Haesoo can never know the truth.</i>

45
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:44,529
Don't ever speak of it,
and take it to your grave.

46
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:48,158
Pyo Jaehyun. He knows everything.

47
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:52,245
Soon, Haesoo will learn the whole truth.

48
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,338
HAESOO

49
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,135
Hey, Haesoo.

50
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:12,515
EPISODE 9

51
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:21,149
Clearly, this is the work
of a professional.

52
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:24,152
Suddenly, the lights went out,
and someone started to scream.

53
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:28,281
How did this person kill someone
in pitch-darkness, huh?

54
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:31,743
By the way, where did Candidate Pyo go?

55
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,621
His wife and her security are gone too.

56
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:38,750
Mr. Pyo's wife wasn't feeling well,
so I heard they left early.

57
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,919
We know where to find him,
so we can always--

58
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:43,338
How could you let out
the most suspicious man here?

59
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,464
Pardon?

60
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:47,258
Ms. Hong's security guard is suspicious.

61
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:50,387
Wherever the bastard appears,
murder always occurs.

62
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:54,099
What are you talking about, Mr. Han?

63
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:58,853
How would you like a special promotion?

64
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:03,316
On the condition
that you do as I say, yeah?

65
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:10,240
Why'd you want to leave early?
It could complicate things later.

66
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,913
We have nothing to do with her death.

67
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:18,915
Right?

68
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:25,296
You look tired.
You should shower and go to bed.

69
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,589
I'll check up on Jiu.

70
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:49,571
Hello?

71
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,322
Why did you do that?

72
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:53,158
They'll be after you now.

73
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,994
Guess you made it out safely,
judging by your tone.

74
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,789
You hurt?

75
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,291
No, I'm fine.

76
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:04,127
I'm at Hanwool.
I'm going to abandon the car here.

77
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,796
Stay there. I'm on my way.

78
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,059
Haesoo.

79
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,942
Why did you want to see me here,
all of a sudden?

80
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,737
- This is--
- Where you proposed to me.

81
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:38,870
I wanted to end things here
for some reason.

82
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:41,748
DIVORCE REGISTRATION
CHILD CUSTODY DESIGNATION

83
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:49,214
I always wondered why your father
never approved of me.

84
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:51,925
Now I know.

85
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:54,969
Haesoo…

86
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,515
Did you think destroying evidence
would make the truth go away?

87
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:02,977
Am I supposed to understand because
you're only protecting your father?

88
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:07,816
Still, I don't think I can forgive you.

89
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,697
You know more than anyone
what life has been like for me.

90
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,617
Just thinking about how you
ripped up those papers and took the time

91
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:20,328
to think about how to lie to me
to hide your father's sins…

92
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,747
breaks my heart into pieces.

93
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,798
So this is how it ends for us.

94
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:37,762
Haesoo-- Haesoo, I'm sorry.

95
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:39,723
I've moved my things to Pyeongchang.

96
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,558
I'll raise Leo.

97
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:45,228
Accept it,
if you have any conscience left.

98
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,447
I'm going to expose
all of your father's sins.

99
00:10:57,365 --> 00:11:00,660
If you try to stop me again
like you did today,

100
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:03,955
you'll never see your son again.

101
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:44,537
Mr. Park, can you help me?

102
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:49,334
HANWOOL MENTAL HOSPITAL

103
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:15,402
Kim Seondeok is dead.
Soon, the police will search this place.

104
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:16,486
You shit!

105
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,246
Take the money, and get out of here.

106
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:29,457
This is your last chance
to cut ties with Hanwool.

107
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,044
Make your choice.

108
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:38,091
Get arrested by the police
and take the fall for Kim's sins.

109
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,093
Or…

110
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,220
start a new life.

111
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:25,347
Stay under the radar for now,
and don't come back to the town house.

112
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:29,434
Jaehyun knows my real identity
and that you're my brother.

113
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,936
Then, let's leave together.
I won't go alone.

114
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,856
If you want our life back,
we need to right our wrongs,

115
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:36,900
if not for Jiu's sake.

116
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:38,818
You know what kind man of Pyo is.

117
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:42,572
You can't take him down alone. I'll expose
the truth that I shot Ko Taesun.

118
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,324
No, I'm taking the fall for that.

119
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:45,992
I told you it's not your fault.

120
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:47,869
You really think that's my only sin?

121
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,288
My pathetic life is done for.

122
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:52,290
Why do you think I killed Kim Seondeok?

123
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,752
I will protect you, no matter what.

124
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:59,089
Don't ever talk like that again.

125
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:18,400
Forgive me for adding to your burdens.

126
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:20,777
I think I owe it to you at this point.

127
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,282
This is my brother.

128
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:28,493
You had a brother?

129
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:31,329
We were separated for a long time
but recently reunited.

130
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,332
- But now--
- No need to explain.

131
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,085
I'm sure you have your reasons.

132
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:38,545
Don't worry, Taera.

133
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:44,300
I'll take good care of your brother,
just as you helped me out.

134
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:46,803
Thank you so much.

135
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:24,758
What do you think you're doing,
barging in here so early?

136
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:28,511
I heard you said you'd give us your full
cooperation. Were we mistaken?

137
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:32,974
Press is criticizing us for giving
preferential treatment to a candidate.

138
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:37,270
If you aren't here with good reason,
I suggest you brace yourselves.

139
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:45,362
Your wife's security
apparently vanished from the crime scene.

140
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,280
So?

141
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:51,618
We were informed that Mr. Cha was also
at the scene of Chairman Song's death,

142
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:53,870
which we'd like to confirm.

143
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,164
As you know, this is a homicide after all.

144
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:01,628
Candidate Han must be quite the informant.

145
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:03,588
I'll get to the point since you know.

146
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:06,591
Mr. Han wants an all-out investigation
on this case.

147
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:10,804
Mr. Cha disappeared from two crime scenes,
and that can't be a coincidence.

148
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:16,267
I'd like to speak to Ms. Hong
about a few things. Is she home?

149
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:21,106
Uh, well…

150
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,858
What would you like to speak about?

151
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:31,324
What is your relationship with Mr. Cha?

152
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:34,077
As you know, he's just security.

153
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:35,662
Is that all?

154
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,416
- What are you implying?
- There's nothing more to it.

155
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,334
Next question, please.

156
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:44,462
Why did you leave the hall
when the event was at its busiest?

157
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:49,801
I wasn't feeling well, so I went to my car
to get some medicine. Is that a problem?

158
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:51,636
Final question, ma'am.

159
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:55,056
May we see the clothes
you wore to the event?

160
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:01,062
May we look for it ourselves?

161
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:05,650
- You have a warrant?
- A warrant would be quite damaging to you.

162
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:07,402
Would you be okay with that, sir?

163
00:17:09,154 --> 00:17:10,947
- Start searching.
- Yes, sir.

164
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:13,408
POLICE

165
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:22,709
Check below the bed,
and search the drawers.

166
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:24,794
- Look thoroughly. It's a dress.
- Yes, sir.

167
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:26,880
Hey, quick--

168
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:38,516
- Search every box.
- Yes, sir.

169
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:40,769
That's going to get dirty.

170
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:47,192
Here you go.

171
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:22,310
We checked Cha's place. He's already gone.

172
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:24,437
His phone's switched off too.

173
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:30,193
I'll have my campaign office send you
Cha's résumé and personal information.

174
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:33,905
You may take the dress,
if you need to run tests on it.

175
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:37,742
Apologies, sir. We were informed
Ms. Hong's dress had blood stains on--

176
00:18:37,826 --> 00:18:42,580
You and your superiors better be prepared
to take full responsibility for this.

177
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:47,877
This was an insult to my wife,
and I won't tolerate any of it.

178
00:18:52,424 --> 00:18:54,259
<i>Politicians and business leaders of Korea</i>

SUSPECTED OF CORRUPTION

NO. 7
PYO JAEHYUN

188
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:20,827
Director Kim Seondeok had offered me
a large contribution to my campaign.

189
00:19:21,536 --> 00:19:23,872
Offers were made at the event as well.

190
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:28,835
But you all know I have the means
for my own campaign.

191
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:34,382
I want to take this opportunity to clarify
that I've received nothing from Kim.

192
00:19:34,466 --> 00:19:39,262
If you find any disreputable connection
in the slightest between me and her,

193
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:41,473
I will immediately withdraw my candidacy.

194
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:44,434
<i>Oh, how terribly frightening.</i>

195
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:47,729
<i>It must've been the first time</i>
<i>you saw someone die.</i>

196
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:49,064
You okay, Taera Hong?

197
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:53,610
Just hearing about it
gives me heart palpitations.

198
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:57,030
What happened to my dress?

199
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:59,240
<i>I was told you spilled wine on it.</i>

200
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:03,828
<i>Mr. Pyo mentioned</i>
<i>how you loved that dress,</i>

201
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:06,581
so he told me
he wanted to get you a new one.

202
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:09,751
That's why I went the extra mile
to get you a new one fast.

203
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:13,046
Mr. Pyo is such a romantic guy.

204
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:15,173
<i>Lucky you.</i>

205
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:16,508
Mommy.

206
00:20:20,512 --> 00:20:23,848
Did you pack everything?
This is her first night away from home.

207
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:26,226
I'll stay with her, so don't worry, ma'am.

208
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:29,020
I think English language camp
will be really fun.

209
00:20:29,104 --> 00:20:31,314
Don't get too sad if you miss me.

210
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:33,233
All right.

211
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:42,158
- Have fun, and remember to call me often.
- Okay.

212
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:45,787
But where's Daddy?

213
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:50,500
Daddy's staying at Grandpa's house
for a while.

214
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,460
I miss Grandpa too.

215
00:20:53,336 --> 00:20:56,548
- Grandma hasn't been coming either.
- She says she's busy.

216
00:20:57,382 --> 00:21:01,136
You won't see her often anymore.
But you'll be fine with Mommy, yeah?

217
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:03,888
Jang Leo!

218
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:06,266
Bye, Mommy.

219
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:08,351
- Let's go.
- Okay.

220
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:23,825
So Kim Seondeok is dead.

221
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:25,452
Or rather,

222
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:27,245
she was killed.

223
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:31,124
It never ceases to amaze me

224
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:34,836
how luck seems to be on your side
with impeccable timing.

225
00:21:37,339 --> 00:21:39,841
Don't be too relieved Kim's dead.

226
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:41,468
I haven't given up yet.

227
00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:46,848
I found the mastermind
behind my father's death.

228
00:21:47,474 --> 00:21:50,226
- Just know it'll be over for you soon.
- The mastermind?

229
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:52,812
Who is it?

230
00:21:52,896 --> 00:21:54,689
You actually seem curious.

231
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:56,691
How interesting.

232
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:03,073
Anytime anything happened in my life,
I shared it with you.

233
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:06,534
We shared our laughs, tears,
joy, and sadness together.

234
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,746
You were my closest friend

235
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:11,956
and my most trusted confidante.

236
00:22:16,586 --> 00:22:18,546
You know what makes you a cruel bitch?

237
00:22:19,214 --> 00:22:20,548
You even took away…

238
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,135
Hong Taera from me.

239
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:27,889
She was my favorite person.

240
00:22:32,727 --> 00:22:34,479
Haesoo.

241
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:37,607
Hey, Mr. Park. Let's go in.

242
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:45,532
<i>It'll all be over soon, Haesoo.</i>

243
00:22:46,616 --> 00:22:47,617
<i>By my hand.</i>

244
00:22:49,911 --> 00:22:52,205
SURNAME: JANG
GIVEN NAMES: JAKE

245
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,334
Haesoo, you okay?

246
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:59,796
No, not until I expose everything.

247
00:23:01,965 --> 00:23:06,219
We need to prove my dad and the chairman
were in conflict before the inauguration.

248
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:07,929
Jang's motive for the murder.

249
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:14,060
You will help me, yes?

250
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:16,813
You're all I have left now.

251
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:25,655
MISSING PERSON: PARK SUJEONG,
DOB: 12/29/1983

252
00:23:25,739 --> 00:23:26,990
CURLY HAIR, GLASSES,
IN WHEELCHAIR

253
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:29,117
How do you know my daughter Sujeong?

254
00:23:31,286 --> 00:23:32,787
Forgive my manners.

255
00:23:33,455 --> 00:23:35,582
I am Jang Kyojin's mother.

256
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:37,334
Kyojin's mother?

257
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:40,587
Oh, my word.
I can't believe we're meeting like this.

258
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:43,882
My daughter looked up to your son.

259
00:23:43,965 --> 00:23:46,551
We were so upset
when we heard about his accident.

260
00:23:46,634 --> 00:23:48,762
Thank you for your kind words.

261
00:23:49,262 --> 00:23:52,390
Kyojin was always a generous young man.

262
00:23:53,266 --> 00:23:58,021
Sujeong wouldn't have had her surgery,
if it weren't for Kyojin's help.

263
00:23:58,605 --> 00:24:01,733
She hurt her spine in an accident,
so she felt quite dejected.

264
00:24:01,816 --> 00:24:04,486
But Kyojin always kept her strong.

265
00:24:05,487 --> 00:24:07,781
He had such a kind heart.

266
00:24:08,531 --> 00:24:11,743
Such a gem he was.
The accident must've devastated you.

267
00:24:11,826 --> 00:24:14,829
Every child is precious to their mother.

268
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:17,832
Of course Sujeong's no exception.

269
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:22,587
Kyojin's told me so much about Sujeong,
so I feel like I already know her.

270
00:24:23,254 --> 00:24:26,466
I heard she was acknowledged
by the research team for her skills.

271
00:24:31,346 --> 00:24:36,518
Did anything seem strange
on the day Sujeong went missing?

272
00:24:38,478 --> 00:24:41,314
She was excited about conducting
an important experiment.

273
00:24:42,065 --> 00:24:45,527
She said we'd go back to the way we were,
if the experiment went well.

274
00:24:46,027 --> 00:24:47,320
She told me not to worry.

275
00:24:47,946 --> 00:24:49,447
What kind of experiment?

276
00:24:49,531 --> 00:24:53,785
She just mentioned it was an experiment
Kyojin's research team was conducting.

277
00:24:54,953 --> 00:24:58,832
I went to the police station every day,
begging them to find my daughter,

278
00:24:58,915 --> 00:25:00,333
but it was no use.

279
00:25:00,917 --> 00:25:04,337
I went to broadcast stations
and protested in front of her school.

280
00:25:07,132 --> 00:25:09,175
But my daughter never returned.

281
00:25:09,843 --> 00:25:12,429
Leave it to us to find her.

282
00:25:12,512 --> 00:25:15,932
But I think you should see a doctor first.
You don't look so well.

283
00:25:16,516 --> 00:25:18,351
Do you think she could be alive?

284
00:25:18,435 --> 00:25:20,061
It's already been seven years.

285
00:25:24,107 --> 00:25:25,567
She has to be alive.

286
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:29,112
A mother should never give up
on her child.

287
00:25:37,704 --> 00:25:38,705
That day…

288
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:43,126
someone came to pick her up.

289
00:25:43,626 --> 00:25:45,545
He was driving a red sports car.

290
00:25:45,628 --> 00:25:47,922
He was from the research team.

291
00:25:48,006 --> 00:25:51,426
Dojin used to have a red sports car.

292
00:25:54,095 --> 00:25:57,182
Do you remember his name or face
by any chance?

293
00:25:57,682 --> 00:26:01,102
He was a little short,
and he was wearing glasses.

294
00:26:01,686 --> 00:26:03,646
His name was Su--

295
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:06,566
I think it was Sungchan.

296
00:26:07,442 --> 00:26:10,070
I told the police about that young man
many times,

297
00:26:10,153 --> 00:26:12,364
but they never summoned him
for an interview.

298
00:26:12,947 --> 00:26:15,075
I still feel uneasy about him to this day.

299
00:26:43,937 --> 00:26:45,397
Coffee's pretty good, right?

300
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,733
I don't go to cafés these days
because of those.

301
00:26:49,776 --> 00:26:50,944
Tastes all right.

302
00:26:51,027 --> 00:26:52,821
What do you want to tell me?

303
00:26:53,738 --> 00:26:55,865
Oh, right. The thing is…

304
00:26:55,949 --> 00:27:01,788
I planted a surveillance camera
inside your campaign office,

305
00:27:02,914 --> 00:27:04,374
at Taera's request.

306
00:27:11,256 --> 00:27:12,757
A surveillance camera?

307
00:27:13,883 --> 00:27:14,926
I couldn't help it.

308
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:19,889
Taera strongly insisted that she needed
to find out something about you.

309
00:27:19,973 --> 00:27:22,517
I just wasn't in my right mind
after Yura died.

310
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,019
For real-- Damn it!

311
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:27,230
I was in so much pain.
I know you understand.

312
00:27:27,981 --> 00:27:31,401
In any case,
Taera is Yura's sister, you know.

313
00:27:31,985 --> 00:27:34,696
She was looking out for me,
what with the food and all--

314
00:27:34,779 --> 00:27:37,073
You think you could refuse such a favor?

315
00:27:37,157 --> 00:27:38,283
You couldn't!

316
00:27:39,951 --> 00:27:40,952
Anyhow,

317
00:27:42,579 --> 00:27:43,580
let's make amends.

318
00:27:45,874 --> 00:27:46,875
I'm sorry.

319
00:27:52,005 --> 00:27:53,673
You know what, man?

320
00:27:53,757 --> 00:27:57,385
You think it was easy for me to be caught
in the middle between you two?

321
00:27:58,303 --> 00:28:01,306
Of course, I shouldn't have done it.

322
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:04,476
We both know that well, no?

323
00:28:06,394 --> 00:28:10,732
We've been friends for what?
About 20 years, right?

324
00:28:11,983 --> 00:28:14,861
- Wow, that's a long time.
- So?

325
00:28:17,989 --> 00:28:18,990
What'd she find out?

326
00:28:21,618 --> 00:28:23,620
It's nothing much, really.

327
00:28:23,703 --> 00:28:27,290
Just about who you'd meet,
where you'd go, and whatnot.

328
00:28:27,791 --> 00:28:30,251
I know that Taera loves you so much,

329
00:28:30,335 --> 00:28:33,922
so, I simply thought,
"A little obsessive, but I'm jealous."

330
00:28:34,005 --> 00:28:35,548
That's what I thought, yeah.

331
00:28:36,132 --> 00:28:38,009
But I'm done with all of that now.

332
00:28:38,093 --> 00:28:40,720
Heck, I deleted the program
and everything.

333
00:28:54,859 --> 00:28:58,279
You have to remain my friend,
so I can entrust you with Hatch, right?

334
00:29:00,198 --> 00:29:02,242
Yeah, of course.

335
00:29:04,536 --> 00:29:06,746
Our friendship is special, isn't it?

336
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,415
It's very special.

337
00:29:09,624 --> 00:29:12,544
We dealt with Sujeong's incident
just fine seven years ago.

338
00:29:15,964 --> 00:29:17,507
Let's do the same with Kyojin.

339
00:29:18,425 --> 00:29:19,968
We still need him for now.

340
00:29:21,219 --> 00:29:22,554
Don't you agree, Sungchan?

341
00:29:41,948 --> 00:29:44,951
Hold on, the brakes aren't working!

342
00:29:48,204 --> 00:29:49,414
Kyojin, what's wrong?

343
00:29:49,497 --> 00:29:50,623
Did something happen?

344
00:29:50,707 --> 00:29:51,833
Kyojin.

345
00:30:18,985 --> 00:30:22,197
Here. Here! Over here!

346
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:33,083
Over here! Please help!

347
00:30:38,338 --> 00:30:39,339
Over here!

348
00:30:40,465 --> 00:30:41,466
Help me!

349
00:30:42,092 --> 00:30:43,218
I'm here!

350
00:30:52,644 --> 00:30:54,229
Help me!

351
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:59,002
<i>So it's one of you,</i>

352
00:32:00,128 --> 00:32:01,713
<i>the bastard who did this to me.</i>

353
00:32:15,643 --> 00:32:16,644
Honey?

354
00:32:19,647 --> 00:32:20,648
Taera.

355
00:32:32,285 --> 00:32:34,496
How far does this story go?

356
00:32:35,872 --> 00:32:37,499
Honey-- What are you doing?

357
00:32:39,668 --> 00:32:40,877
You know everything.

358
00:32:41,795 --> 00:32:42,796
You know who I am.

359
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:44,631
Taera…

360
00:32:47,717 --> 00:32:48,718
That's right.

361
00:32:49,511 --> 00:32:50,929
I know it was you

362
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:53,098
who made me Hong Taera.

363
00:32:59,187 --> 00:33:00,188
Why'd you do it?

364
00:33:01,022 --> 00:33:02,482
What was the reason?

365
00:33:02,565 --> 00:33:05,151
Why'd you marry me
if you knew I was No. 50?

366
00:33:07,362 --> 00:33:09,280
Why have you dragged me to this point?

367
00:33:10,365 --> 00:33:11,366
No.

368
00:33:12,951 --> 00:33:14,411
You're not No. 50.

369
00:33:15,995 --> 00:33:16,996
What?

370
00:33:19,082 --> 00:33:20,166
Mun Hagyeong.

371
00:33:25,505 --> 00:33:27,424
That's your real name.

372
00:33:28,341 --> 00:33:29,676
How do you know that?

373
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:33,304
Twenty years ago,
on the night of the accident…

374
00:33:35,265 --> 00:33:37,600
we were both on that road, Hagyeong.

375
00:33:43,314 --> 00:33:46,151
20 YEARS AGO

376
00:33:46,234 --> 00:33:48,194
How was our trip to Gyeongju?

377
00:33:48,278 --> 00:33:49,904
- Let's hear it from Dad!
- Sure.

378
00:33:50,405 --> 00:33:53,408
Thanks to you for taking good care
of your brother,

379
00:33:53,491 --> 00:33:57,412
Mom and Dad were able to spend
quality time. It was great!

380
00:33:57,495 --> 00:33:58,705
Wow.

381
00:33:59,706 --> 00:34:02,625
I should also find a boyfriend
to go on dates with.

382
00:34:02,709 --> 00:34:04,586
I'm so envious of you two.

383
00:34:04,669 --> 00:34:06,921
Dad won't like it
when you get a boyfriend.

384
00:34:07,005 --> 00:34:09,049
Correct. I will not like it.

385
00:34:09,632 --> 00:34:11,676
- Dad. Eyes on the road, please.
- Okay.

386
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,928
That car over there
is moving very fast.

387
00:34:14,012 --> 00:34:15,847
Huh? What's up with that car?

388
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:18,475
I think they're going to collide.

389
00:34:19,392 --> 00:34:20,643
Dad!

390
00:34:41,331 --> 00:34:42,874
Hajun, are you okay?

391
00:34:44,417 --> 00:34:45,919
Mommy.

392
00:34:46,628 --> 00:34:48,296
Mom, Dad. Are you all right?

393
00:34:55,428 --> 00:34:56,429
Mom.

394
00:34:58,223 --> 00:34:59,224
Dad!

395
00:34:59,307 --> 00:35:00,975
Get up!

396
00:35:06,147 --> 00:35:07,148
Mom.

397
00:35:07,982 --> 00:35:09,192
Dad!

398
00:35:13,029 --> 00:35:15,782
How many times do I have to tell you?
I know what I saw.

399
00:35:15,865 --> 00:35:18,243
There was also a black car.

400
00:35:18,827 --> 00:35:21,788
The black car suddenly rammed
into the white one from behind.

401
00:35:21,871 --> 00:35:24,833
It was strange how close it was.
The crash was intentional.

402
00:35:24,916 --> 00:35:26,876
There was no black car at the scene.

403
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,753
You have it all wrong, okay?

404
00:35:28,837 --> 00:35:32,716
The white car skidded in the rain
and crashed into yours.

405
00:35:33,758 --> 00:35:36,845
One of the passengers in the white car
is currently missing,

406
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:39,264
but once we find him, it's over.

407
00:35:39,347 --> 00:35:40,932
Don't just stand there. Take her.

408
00:35:41,016 --> 00:35:42,100
Young lady.

409
00:35:42,183 --> 00:35:45,228
Officer! Why don't you believe me?

410
00:35:45,311 --> 00:35:47,022
The black car did it on purpose!

411
00:35:47,105 --> 00:35:49,149
Why don't you believe me?

412
00:36:02,245 --> 00:36:03,246
Hagyeong!

413
00:36:05,206 --> 00:36:06,499
Hey.

414
00:36:06,583 --> 00:36:09,377
Why are you so late?
I was waiting for you all day.

415
00:36:09,878 --> 00:36:11,254
What are you doing out here?

416
00:36:12,005 --> 00:36:13,089
You hungry?

417
00:36:14,174 --> 00:36:16,468
I bought some <i>gimbap</i>.

418
00:36:17,177 --> 00:36:18,345
I was wondering…

419
00:36:19,888 --> 00:36:22,140
are Mom and Dad dead?

420
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,601
What?

421
00:36:25,352 --> 00:36:26,478
Who said that?

422
00:36:27,062 --> 00:36:30,398
Taeyong said that's what his mom told him.

423
00:36:31,608 --> 00:36:32,609
Is it true?

424
00:36:36,154 --> 00:36:37,155
Hajun.

425
00:36:55,715 --> 00:36:59,678
<i>I found out Chairman Jang</i>
<i>ordered Mr. Uhm to get rid of you two.</i>

426
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:03,556
I wanted to warn you,
but I couldn't track you down.

427
00:37:06,476 --> 00:37:09,062
If only you hadn't seen
Mr. Uhm's car, then--

428
00:37:09,562 --> 00:37:10,772
No.

429
00:37:10,855 --> 00:37:13,817
If only you hadn't gone to the police
and told the truth…

430
00:37:16,111 --> 00:37:18,738
you'd be living happily
as Mun Hagyeong right now.

431
00:37:30,458 --> 00:37:31,960
You and I

432
00:37:32,043 --> 00:37:35,213
both lost our parents
in the same accident on the same day.

433
00:37:37,132 --> 00:37:38,925
All because of Jang Kummo.

434
00:37:41,845 --> 00:37:44,639
And then… we met again.

435
00:37:51,312 --> 00:37:53,523
<i>While I was looking into Chairman Jang,</i>

436
00:37:53,606 --> 00:37:57,861
<i>I found out he was the one behind</i>
<i>President Ko's assassination,</i>

437
00:37:57,944 --> 00:38:00,071
<i>and to confirm this,</i>
<i>I went looking for the killer.</i>

438
00:38:00,155 --> 00:38:01,740
<i>And in my search,</i>

439
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:04,242
<i>I found you.</i>

440
00:38:05,452 --> 00:38:06,453
Mun Hagyeong?

441
00:38:08,121 --> 00:38:10,498
That's when I realized it was destiny.

442
00:38:10,582 --> 00:38:12,751
No, stop. I don't believe you.

443
00:38:13,376 --> 00:38:14,377
Stop it.

444
00:38:14,461 --> 00:38:17,297
Taera, forget everything else.
Nothing else matters.

445
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:19,507
What matters is that we met again.

446
00:38:21,801 --> 00:38:22,802
I…

447
00:38:24,137 --> 00:38:26,264
I took you to France and saved your life.

448
00:38:27,557 --> 00:38:28,767
I never gave up on you.

449
00:38:29,851 --> 00:38:33,396
I made up my mind to exact revenge
on Jang Kummo who made you this way…

450
00:38:35,231 --> 00:38:36,816
and to restore by my hands…

451
00:38:38,651 --> 00:38:41,279
the life you've lost.

452
00:38:44,616 --> 00:38:46,201
You may have lost your memories,

453
00:38:47,285 --> 00:38:50,663
but you became the perfect version
of the Hong Taera that I wanted.

454
00:38:50,747 --> 00:38:52,082
No!

455
00:39:01,466 --> 00:39:03,218
<i>That's why I led you to Haesoo.</i>

456
00:39:05,887 --> 00:39:07,222
<i>You're insane!</i>

457
00:39:08,056 --> 00:39:10,100
Why would you bring Haesoo into my life?

458
00:39:10,183 --> 00:39:13,853
Did you think about how hurt she'd be
if she found out the truth?

459
00:39:13,937 --> 00:39:15,605
We're all victims here.

460
00:39:16,439 --> 00:39:17,982
This is all Jang Kummo's doing.

461
00:39:18,066 --> 00:39:20,402
Haesoo should hate Jang Kummo, not you.

462
00:39:20,485 --> 00:39:23,488
If you knew all this time
that he killed her father,

463
00:39:23,571 --> 00:39:26,783
how did you just sit there and watch her
get married to Dojin?

464
00:39:26,866 --> 00:39:27,867
How--

465
00:39:28,618 --> 00:39:30,203
How does that make any sense?

466
00:39:30,286 --> 00:39:32,872
Isn't it more interesting
because it doesn't make sense?

467
00:39:32,956 --> 00:39:34,165
Isn't it satisfying…

468
00:39:34,791 --> 00:39:37,794
to think about how miserable
their union makes Chairman Jang?

469
00:39:42,298 --> 00:39:44,259
Why'd you help me restore my memories…

470
00:39:46,261 --> 00:39:47,637
and put me in danger?

471
00:39:48,555 --> 00:39:50,724
So that you'd rely on me more.

472
00:39:53,351 --> 00:39:55,311
I've waited for this day for so long.

473
00:39:56,354 --> 00:39:59,190
When will you ask for the truth
once you remember it all?

474
00:39:59,274 --> 00:40:01,568
Once you've figured everything out,

475
00:40:02,736 --> 00:40:04,154
how proud will you be of me?

476
00:40:04,904 --> 00:40:06,197
Maybe you'll love me more.

477
00:40:06,281 --> 00:40:08,158
I waited for this moment every day.

478
00:40:08,241 --> 00:40:11,369
No, I never asked to become Hong Taera.

479
00:40:11,453 --> 00:40:13,455
You're greedy and delusional.

480
00:40:13,538 --> 00:40:16,458
I made you the happiest woman
in the entire world.

481
00:40:17,375 --> 00:40:21,046
I erased your painful memories as No. 50
and gave you this fairy-tale life.

482
00:40:21,129 --> 00:40:23,840
A perfect Hong Taera.
Hong Taera is perfect!

483
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:26,551
You really don't get it?

484
00:40:34,351 --> 00:40:36,019
I'm a murderer.

485
00:40:37,729 --> 00:40:39,689
And I've done some unforgivable things.

486
00:40:40,815 --> 00:40:43,735
Pretending none of it happened
changes nothing.

487
00:40:43,818 --> 00:40:45,278
I'll take care of all that.

488
00:40:45,362 --> 00:40:48,698
I'm going to put a stop
to Kim Seondeok's investigation too!

489
00:40:48,782 --> 00:40:51,618
I've always told you.
All you have to do is trust me.

490
00:40:51,701 --> 00:40:53,370
I can fix everything!

491
00:40:53,453 --> 00:40:54,454
Taera.

492
00:40:55,121 --> 00:40:58,958
I'm going to become president,
and you'll be the first lady.

493
00:41:00,543 --> 00:41:04,214
What about Hong Yura whom you killed,
or Haesoo who still has no clue,

494
00:41:04,297 --> 00:41:07,008
or the countless people
whom you sacrificed?

495
00:41:07,092 --> 00:41:10,595
- Don't you feel guilty at all--
- None of that shit matters!

496
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:14,724
All you have to do is to live as Taera,
Jiu's mom, my wife, and the first lady.

497
00:41:14,808 --> 00:41:15,892
Happily ever after!

498
00:41:17,352 --> 00:41:18,603
No.

499
00:41:18,687 --> 00:41:21,189
I don't want to live
as your creation of Hong Taera.

500
00:41:25,026 --> 00:41:27,362
A man like you should never
become president.

501
00:41:28,363 --> 00:41:31,408
Give it all up, and let's pay the price
for our sins together.

502
00:41:33,535 --> 00:41:36,413
Taera, why are you doing this?

503
00:41:37,288 --> 00:41:39,541
Are we not happy and in love?

504
00:41:40,291 --> 00:41:42,669
Isn't that enough? Forget about the past!

505
00:41:42,752 --> 00:41:45,755
Say it! Say you'll give it all up.

506
00:42:00,061 --> 00:42:01,229
Mommy!

507
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:02,772
Oh, Jiu.

508
00:42:06,776 --> 00:42:08,319
Something happen at camp?

509
00:42:08,403 --> 00:42:12,365
Mr. Pyo called and said he was worried
about Jiu staying overnight.

510
00:42:12,449 --> 00:42:14,826
Please leave the bags there. Thank you.

511
00:42:16,244 --> 00:42:19,330
But Mom, Dad. What were you doing?

512
00:42:19,956 --> 00:42:22,000
Were you… fighting?

513
00:42:22,584 --> 00:42:24,919
I don't like it when you fight.

514
00:42:25,003 --> 00:42:27,297
I like it when you love each other.

515
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:29,591
Daddy loves Mommy very much.

516
00:42:29,674 --> 00:42:31,134
I love you too, Jiu!

517
00:42:31,217 --> 00:42:32,886
Who's going to tuck me in today?

518
00:42:32,969 --> 00:42:35,472
Daddy will! I'll also read you a book.

519
00:42:35,555 --> 00:42:38,141
- Yay! I'll go choose one!
- Okay!

520
00:42:42,645 --> 00:42:43,646
See that?

521
00:42:45,565 --> 00:42:46,941
Look how happy we are.

522
00:42:51,571 --> 00:42:52,822
Don't look for Pilseung.

523
00:42:54,491 --> 00:42:57,369
There's no place for him
in the family I've created.

524
00:42:57,452 --> 00:42:58,745
You understand?

525
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:40,912
I was told Haesoo is holding a press
conference today. Did you know?

526
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:45,417
You said it, Father.
Haesoo has learned the whole truth.

527
00:43:45,917 --> 00:43:51,047
She knows you're the one who bought
the blue sapphire under Jake Company.

528
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:54,509
Father, you're finished.

529
00:43:55,885 --> 00:43:59,472
Are you really going to stab
your own father in the back?

530
00:43:59,556 --> 00:44:02,350
Don't you know who I did all of this for?

531
00:44:10,191 --> 00:44:11,526
Did I ask you to?

532
00:44:12,527 --> 00:44:16,531
<i>Stop using me as a cover for your greed.</i>
<i>The shame of being your son is killing me.</i>

533
00:44:17,866 --> 00:44:20,076
<i>Let Haesoo lash out all she wants.</i>

534
00:44:20,618 --> 00:44:22,495
It's not like you can stop her anyway.

535
00:44:36,009 --> 00:44:37,510
<i>Mun Hagyeong.</i>

536
00:44:37,594 --> 00:44:38,970
That's your real name.

537
00:44:40,263 --> 00:44:43,058
If only you hadn't seen
Mr. Uhm's car, then--

538
00:44:43,141 --> 00:44:44,434
No.

539
00:44:44,517 --> 00:44:47,103
If only you hadn't gone to the police
and told the truth,

540
00:44:47,187 --> 00:44:49,814
<i>you'd be living happily</i>
<i>as Mun Hagyeong right now.</i>

541
00:44:51,024 --> 00:44:52,817
You and I…

542
00:44:52,901 --> 00:44:55,362
both lost our parents
in the same accident on the same day.

543
00:44:55,445 --> 00:44:56,780
All because of Jang Kummo.

544
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:05,205
Haesoo.

545
00:45:07,374 --> 00:45:08,833
Hey, Mr. Park. Tell me.

546
00:45:09,584 --> 00:45:13,672
<i>Fifteen years ago, your father ordered</i>
<i>Kumjo to be investigated for corruption.</i>

547
00:45:14,464 --> 00:45:17,300
- You sure?
- I'm on my way with proof of testimony.

548
00:45:17,384 --> 00:45:19,552
Delay the press conference
until I get there.

549
00:45:19,636 --> 00:45:21,221
Okay, I'll meet you there.

550
00:45:21,846 --> 00:45:23,056
What press conference?

551
00:45:23,848 --> 00:45:26,267
Is it going to be
about your father's case?

552
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:28,645
What? You want to stop me?

553
00:45:29,479 --> 00:45:32,816
You scared now that your true identity
is about to be exposed?

554
00:45:33,692 --> 00:45:37,070
I'll tell you everything
about what really happened that day.

555
00:45:38,154 --> 00:45:39,906
I'll tell you everything I know.

556
00:45:40,824 --> 00:45:44,035
No, you will wait until it's your turn

557
00:45:44,994 --> 00:45:47,831
nervously and anxiously,
as I did for the past 15 years.

558
00:45:47,914 --> 00:45:50,792
You're missing something important
about your father's death.

559
00:45:50,875 --> 00:45:51,876
Jaehyun--

560
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:53,795
I told you I don't trust you.

561
00:45:54,838 --> 00:45:56,715
Don't ever get in my way again.

562
00:45:56,798 --> 00:45:58,174
If you do, I will kill you.

563
00:45:59,676 --> 00:46:02,429
Haesoo. Haesoo!

564
00:46:02,512 --> 00:46:05,223
Please hear me out, Haesoo!

565
00:46:05,306 --> 00:46:07,350
It won't take long! Hold on, Haesoo!

566
00:46:08,226 --> 00:46:09,227
Haesoo!

567
00:46:24,117 --> 00:46:25,952
Did you get the authorization papers?

568
00:46:26,036 --> 00:46:27,370
It's been taken care of.

569
00:46:27,454 --> 00:46:29,873
As of now, Dojin
is the acting chairman of Kumjo.

570
00:46:35,795 --> 00:46:36,880
All right. Good work.

571
00:46:37,964 --> 00:46:39,215
What about Jake Company?

572
00:46:39,966 --> 00:46:43,345
The money is ready for wire transfer.
All we need is your credentials, sir.

573
00:46:43,428 --> 00:46:44,763
TRANSFER PAYMENT
1 BILLION WON

574
00:46:51,478 --> 00:46:53,271
ENTER PIN TO CONFIRM TRANSACTION

575
00:46:55,732 --> 00:46:56,733
All done.

576
00:46:57,859 --> 00:47:00,862
Get rid of Jake Company without a trace.
Got it?

577
00:47:06,785 --> 00:47:07,786
You hear what I said?

578
00:47:16,878 --> 00:47:17,962
What are you doing here?

579
00:47:18,046 --> 00:47:19,422
You look busy.

580
00:47:20,715 --> 00:47:23,176
You have a lot of sins
to cover up, don't you?

581
00:47:23,259 --> 00:47:24,636
Why you little--

582
00:47:24,719 --> 00:47:25,720
Shut your mouth!

583
00:47:26,638 --> 00:47:29,724
You've stolen so much for Kumjo.
Such hard work.

584
00:47:30,642 --> 00:47:33,770
Now, it's time for you
to hand Kumjo over to me.

585
00:47:34,437 --> 00:47:36,731
Wasn't it the price of my mother's life?

586
00:47:37,315 --> 00:47:38,650
Have you lost your mind?

587
00:47:39,442 --> 00:47:40,443
What did you just--

588
00:47:41,277 --> 00:47:43,321
Why are you not kicking him out?

589
00:47:43,405 --> 00:47:47,909
Damn it. Stop harassing Mr. Uhm.
You think he's your slave?

590
00:47:49,536 --> 00:47:50,537
What'd you say?

591
00:47:51,287 --> 00:47:53,998
<i>You sure you can get rid of Ko Taesun?</i>

592
00:48:07,387 --> 00:48:09,347
15 YEARS AGO

593
00:48:15,603 --> 00:48:17,772
Please reconsider, Chairman.

594
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:25,864
Who the hell do you think you are?

595
00:48:25,947 --> 00:48:29,951
All you have to do is to do as I say.

596
00:48:30,035 --> 00:48:33,079
That's all you're good for. Understood?

597
00:48:35,457 --> 00:48:37,250
Make sure the job gets done.

598
00:48:38,209 --> 00:48:40,337
I better not see Ko Taesun ever again.

599
00:48:50,805 --> 00:48:53,516
There's plenty more evidence
aside from this.

600
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:56,353
I've been collecting them at every chance.

601
00:48:56,436 --> 00:48:59,606
Mr. Uhm is practically
the living proof of your sins.

602
00:49:01,524 --> 00:49:03,151
Lucky for you, he's my man now.

603
00:49:26,383 --> 00:49:28,927
Be sure there are absolutely
no loose ends.

604
00:49:29,010 --> 00:49:31,596
Hurry up and find Dr. Kim's damn son!

605
00:49:33,348 --> 00:49:35,183
The chairman is nervous.

606
00:49:53,076 --> 00:49:54,327
You.

607
00:49:54,411 --> 00:49:55,495
Shit.

608
00:49:56,955 --> 00:50:00,250
Her damn son is right here.
Where'd you take those poor kids?

609
00:50:00,333 --> 00:50:01,626
Will they be killed too?

610
00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:04,754
Nothing you do will change a thing
about their fate.

611
00:50:04,838 --> 00:50:07,382
If he finds out,
you'll wind up like them too--

612
00:50:07,465 --> 00:50:09,551
Think you'll end up any differently?

613
00:50:09,634 --> 00:50:11,553
Aren't you expendable to him?

614
00:50:12,470 --> 00:50:14,180
I could just kill you right now.

615
00:50:14,764 --> 00:50:17,017
So… you going to kill me?

616
00:50:18,601 --> 00:50:19,602
No.

617
00:50:21,021 --> 00:50:22,355
I'm going to let you live.

618
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:26,484
Because your life is in my hands.

619
00:50:31,322 --> 00:50:37,704
I recorded you stealing the dashcam
and my mom's research files.

620
00:50:45,003 --> 00:50:46,421
It's taken care of, Chairman.

621
00:50:47,297 --> 00:50:49,632
I've secured Dr. Kim's research files.

622
00:50:49,716 --> 00:50:51,217
Yes, sir.

623
00:50:58,641 --> 00:51:02,020
I already know
you're only Jang Kummo's bitch,

624
00:51:03,688 --> 00:51:04,981
who does what he's told.

625
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:09,069
I'll help you break free…

626
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:11,988
from your shitty fate.

627
00:51:18,661 --> 00:51:22,624
So he worked his charm
and convinced you to betray me.

628
00:51:23,375 --> 00:51:25,585
After all that I've done for you?

629
00:51:25,669 --> 00:51:29,297
I was also thinking of the countless
lives I've taken by your orders.

630
00:51:30,006 --> 00:51:31,007
Eventually,

631
00:51:31,091 --> 00:51:32,634
you would've gotten rid of me too.

632
00:51:32,717 --> 00:51:34,969
You ungrateful bastard!

633
00:51:39,349 --> 00:51:41,726
Jaehyun has been generous
to me over the years.

634
00:51:42,394 --> 00:51:44,562
He's even offered me a position at Kumjo.

635
00:51:45,271 --> 00:51:49,150
Wouldn't that be a "profitable business,"
as you always say, Chairman?

636
00:51:50,527 --> 00:51:52,654
Who says I'll give Kumjo to him?

637
00:51:52,737 --> 00:51:53,738
Who?

638
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:55,824
You don't have much time.

639
00:51:57,659 --> 00:52:00,995
Soon, your daughter-in-law Ko Haesoo
will destroy what's left of you.

640
00:52:15,343 --> 00:52:18,638
I transferred all of Jake Company's funds
to the account you mentioned.

641
00:52:21,349 --> 00:52:24,769
Appreciate the hard work.
How kind of you to transfer it yourself.

642
00:52:25,645 --> 00:52:26,980
Not those funds.

643
00:52:31,276 --> 00:52:33,361
Not those funds.

644
00:52:34,738 --> 00:52:36,823
It-- It's for Dojin.

645
00:53:02,515 --> 00:53:05,185
You should call an ambulance now.

646
00:53:05,977 --> 00:53:06,978
He can't die yet.

647
00:53:08,313 --> 00:53:10,732
He needs to see
when Kumjo is handed over to me.

648
00:53:12,859 --> 00:53:15,445
I'll give your precious son a call.

649
00:53:29,626 --> 00:53:32,295
Emergency? A man has fainted.

650
00:53:46,267 --> 00:53:49,312
What happened?
What the hell did you do to my father?

651
00:53:49,396 --> 00:53:51,189
He's reaping what he sowed.

652
00:53:51,272 --> 00:53:53,942
What he did to my mother
and Haesoo's father.

653
00:53:54,025 --> 00:53:55,819
- Shall I recount the story?
- You bastard!

654
00:54:01,908 --> 00:54:04,411
I get it. All of this feels unfair to you.

655
00:54:04,494 --> 00:54:08,665
You're wondering why you have to suffer
just because you're Jang Kummo's son.

656
00:54:10,083 --> 00:54:12,127
At least you still have a mother.

657
00:54:15,338 --> 00:54:18,508
This doesn't feel good.
We were friends at one point.

658
00:54:18,591 --> 00:54:21,261
- Shut it, you son of a bitch.
- I'll give you a chance.

659
00:54:22,345 --> 00:54:24,848
Merge Kumjo Pharmaceuticals with Hatch.

660
00:54:24,931 --> 00:54:26,266
What?

661
00:54:26,349 --> 00:54:31,062
If I say the word, your father will be
summoned by the prosecution right away.

662
00:54:31,146 --> 00:54:33,481
From Kumjo Group's
embezzlement of slush funds…

663
00:54:34,107 --> 00:54:35,734
to aiding and abetting murder.

664
00:54:36,985 --> 00:54:41,072
Your father can't do anything about it,
so shouldn't you be the one to silence me?

665
00:54:44,743 --> 00:54:48,163
You'll never get your way.
Besides, Haesoo knows everything.

666
00:54:48,246 --> 00:54:49,581
Not even you can stop her.

667
00:54:50,582 --> 00:54:53,209
I'd rather let Haesoo punish me
than kneel before you.

668
00:54:53,293 --> 00:54:55,628
Dojin. Dojin, Dojin!

669
00:54:56,671 --> 00:54:58,715
You're going to stop Haesoo.

670
00:55:01,009 --> 00:55:04,220
If she tells the press everything,
it won't be just your father.

671
00:55:04,304 --> 00:55:07,766
Kumjo will immediately dissipate
into nothingness. You okay with that?

672
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:11,144
Your Father dedicated his entire life
to Kumjo.

673
00:55:11,728 --> 00:55:12,937
You think he'll survive?

674
00:55:15,565 --> 00:55:18,151
Are you willing to let this
kill your father?

675
00:55:26,159 --> 00:55:27,202
Take your pick.

676
00:55:28,119 --> 00:55:29,496
Haesoo whom you love

677
00:55:30,413 --> 00:55:31,915
or your father who loves you?

678
00:55:33,541 --> 00:55:34,709
Whom will you abandon?

679
00:55:58,817 --> 00:56:00,068

<i>Please leave a message after the tone.</i>
<i>Additional charges may apply.</i>

682
00:56:17,544 --> 00:56:18,837
Mr. Park, where are you?

683
00:56:19,713 --> 00:56:22,549
Did something happen?
It's already been an hour.

684
00:56:23,591 --> 00:56:25,010
Call me back soon.

685
00:56:33,518 --> 00:56:34,686
Hello? Mr. Park?

PRESS CONFERENCE ROOM

687
00:57:10,930 --> 00:57:12,807
As of today, I, Jang Dojin,

688
00:57:12,891 --> 00:57:17,062
will be the acting chairman
of Kumjo Group, effective immediately.

689
00:57:18,438 --> 00:57:21,775
In addition, I am announcing
the official merger and acquisition…

690
00:57:25,236 --> 00:57:28,656
of Kumjo Pharmaceuticals,
a subsidiary of Kumjo Group, and Hatch.

691
00:57:38,333 --> 00:57:40,043
So this is the choice you've made?

692
00:57:40,126 --> 00:57:42,295
Stabbing me in the back
to save your father?

693
00:57:44,422 --> 00:57:45,548
I have to protect

694
00:57:46,341 --> 00:57:47,926
both Kumjo and my father.

695
00:57:49,177 --> 00:57:50,178
What?

696
00:57:53,264 --> 00:57:54,974
I signed the divorce papers.

697
00:57:55,058 --> 00:57:57,185
I'm raising Leo.
I've already sent someone.

698
00:57:57,268 --> 00:58:00,021
Have you lost your mind?
I'll never let you take Leo.

699
00:58:00,105 --> 00:58:02,482
I won't let him grow up
in your filthy household!

700
00:58:02,565 --> 00:58:06,319
I'll expose all your father's sins
and everything else you tried to cover up.

701
00:58:06,403 --> 00:58:07,946
Who's going to believe you?

702
00:58:10,031 --> 00:58:12,534
You're… sick.

703
00:58:14,828 --> 00:58:16,204
What are you talking about?

704
00:58:20,041 --> 00:58:21,918
Why do you think Mr. Park isn't here?

705
00:58:23,211 --> 00:58:24,379
There's no one…

706
00:58:25,547 --> 00:58:26,881
left to help you.

707
00:58:31,636 --> 00:58:35,473
Your mother had a history of psychiatric
treatments and committed suicide.

708
00:58:35,557 --> 00:58:37,058
The whole world knows it.

709
00:58:37,976 --> 00:58:39,561
Just leave the country. Quietly.

710
00:58:42,647 --> 00:58:43,648
How can you?

711
00:58:44,858 --> 00:58:46,776
How can you do this to me?

712
00:58:48,486 --> 00:58:50,530
I'm not giving up Leo. Never!

713
00:58:59,164 --> 00:59:00,540
What's this?

714
00:59:04,336 --> 00:59:06,129
Jang Dojin.

715
00:59:06,755 --> 00:59:08,214
Jang Dojin, you bastard!

716
00:59:10,008 --> 00:59:11,217
Don't come any closer.

717
00:59:12,010 --> 00:59:13,011
Jang Dojin!

718
00:59:29,069 --> 00:59:31,613
I'll take Ko Haesoo
to the airport right away.

719
00:59:32,822 --> 00:59:34,991
No, take her to Incheon Port.

720
00:59:35,075 --> 00:59:36,951
And don't tell Dojin.

721
00:59:37,577 --> 00:59:39,037
Don't tell me…

722
00:59:39,913 --> 00:59:42,207
<i>Haesoo's suffered enough.</i>

723
00:59:42,874 --> 00:59:44,834
It's time we lay her down to rest

724
00:59:45,627 --> 00:59:48,046
next to her parents she misses so badly.

725
01:00:09,859 --> 01:00:13,905
You could've just told me
that Jang Kummo killed Ko Taesun.

726
01:00:16,658 --> 01:00:20,286
Must I report every single thing to you
when I'm paying you a fortune?

727
01:00:22,372 --> 01:00:25,667
Don't you think you're being too cruel
to Haesoo? She's innocent.

728
01:00:26,918 --> 01:00:27,919
It's funny

729
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:33,258
to hear that from you when you
betrayed her to pay back your debt.

730
01:00:37,721 --> 01:00:38,722
Haesoo

731
01:00:39,889 --> 01:00:40,974
will be safe, right?

732
01:02:02,931 --> 01:02:04,265
The hell is this?

733
01:02:31,334 --> 01:02:33,795
Hey, who the hell are you? You punk!

734
01:02:51,438 --> 01:02:52,439
Haesoo.

735
01:02:53,064 --> 01:02:54,065
Haesoo, wake up.

736
01:02:54,899 --> 01:02:55,900
Haesoo.

737
01:02:58,361 --> 01:02:59,487

for so long, is me, Haesoo.

740
01:03:33,772 --> 01:03:35,690
She'll never abandon me.

741
01:03:35,774 --> 01:03:36,691
Stop them!
