PANDORA : BENEATH THE PARADISE

2
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:05,904
I do solemnly swear

3
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:10,902
before the people that I will faithfully
execute the duties of the president

4
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:13,237
by observing the constitution,
defending the state,

5
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:16,663
promoting the freedom
and welfare of the people,

6
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:19,333
and endeavoring
to develop national culture.

{\an8}EPISODE 8

00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:27,165
{\an8}You want to see your sister?

9
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:30,473
{\an8}Then do as I say.

10
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:35,183
{\an8}If your sister fails,
you must finish the job for her.

11
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:37,471
{\an8}Or else, your sister dies.

12
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:39,385
{\an8}No. Please spare my sister.

13
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:46,691
{\an8}That's up to you, No. 105.

14
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:51,651
{\an8}This is all for your sister,

15
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:54,405
{\an8}No. 105.

16
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:06,083
[Taesun]
I do solemnly swear before the nation.

17
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:08,924
- President Ko Taesun.
- [crowd applauds]

18

<i>It's all for my sister.</i>

- [crowd screaming]

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,320
Come on.

00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:50,502
[footsteps approaching]

23
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:56,718

25

Call Mr. Jo.

26
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:14,693
Tell him if he loses that bitch,
all of you will die by my hands!

27
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,286
Sis, I missed you so much.

28
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:25,579
What's wrong?

29
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:40,511
What happened?

30
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:42,723
Why are you here?

31
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:46,598
I thought you were in school,
doing stuff like any other kid.

32
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:48,845
Why did you become No. 105? Why?

33
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:53,317
The director said I'd never see you again
if I didn't do as she said.

34
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,240
[sobbing] That's why…

35
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,201
What took you so long, Sis?

36
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:02,449
You know how much I waited for you?
You know how scared I was?

37
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,000
[sobbing] I'm sorry, Hajun.

38
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,251
It's all my fault.

39
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,706
I really had no idea.

40
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:17,761
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

41
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,353
[tires screech]

00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,182
Hey! Search over there!

43
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:29,022
Over there!

44
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,948
I said get closer! Closer!

45
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:47,745
- Get rid of them.
- [radio beeps]

46
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:54,995
No!

47
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:04,389
[No. 105] Then and now,
this pathetic way of life is my fate.

48
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:07,809
I'm a lowlife
who only does what he's told.

49
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:11,191
If Mother orders me to kill, I kill.
That's why I shot Ko Taesun!

50
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:12,729
No!

51
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,823
It wasn't you. It's not your fault.

52
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,568
I did it. I killed him.

53
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:23,816
Forget what happened that day.
Forget it all, okay?

54
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:25,987
Why do you care how I live my life?

55
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,655
Why would you say that, Hajun?

56
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,421
Can you leave everything behind?

57
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:38,463
Can you live the rest of your life,
not for Jaehyun nor Jiu

58
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:40,166
but only for my sake?

59
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:43,677
Answer me.

60
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,430
Can you abandon your life as Taera
so we can be the family we used to be?

61
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:56,733
If you do, I'll put all of this behind me.

62
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,619
But you won't abandon anyone or anything

63
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:17,537
because you abandoned me to protect them.

64
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,970
So just keep pretending
this fancy life is yours

65
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,176
and mind your own business.

66
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:44,323
INCOMING CALL
MY TREASURE

67
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,164
[phone buzzes]

68
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:52,661
Yes, Jiu.

69
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,419
Mommy's heading home now.

70
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,460
Okay, got it.

71
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,171

[No. 50] <i>I did it. I killed him.</i>

<i>Forget what happened that day.</i>
<i>Forget it all, okay?</i>

75
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:49,718
[Haesoo] Tell me, Hong Taera.

76
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,353
Are you No. 50,
the assassin who shot my father?

77
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,720
Answer me!

78
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,694
<i>You would take the fall for me, huh?</i>

79
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,824
<i>Were you expecting me to thank you?</i>

80
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:22,292
{\an8}<i>Breaking news.</i>

81
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:25,957
{\an8}<i>Moments ago, Manhwe Group's</i>
<i>Chairman Song Juman has died.</i>

82
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:28,467
{\an8}<i>The presumed cause of death,</i>
<i>acute myocardial infarction.</i>

83
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,880
[Seondeok] What did I tell you?

84
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:34,008
- <i>Police say an autopsy will be performed.</i>
- No. 105 is excellent at his job.

85
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:39,274
Have I proven my loyalty to you, Mr. Pyo?

86
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:40,773
[Seondeok chuckles]

87
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:46,573
Proof that Han received Song's money
has been handed over to the prosecution.

88
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:48,741
They won't let him off the hook easily.

89
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:52,910
How dare they lay their hands on you.

90
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,371
They must pay for their sins, no?
[clicks tongue]

91
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,504
Cha Pilseung.

92
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,000
Can we trust him?

93
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:03,249
You just saw how he carried out my orders.

94
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:06,552
He'd put his life on the line
upon my command.

95
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,379
You don't have to worry, sir.

96
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,255
I think you're being overly confident.

97
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:14,432
You know what they say,
blood is thicker than water.

98
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:17,472
No. 105 considers me his mother.

99
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:22,017
I conditioned him to think of me
as his mother for 15 years.

100
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,483
This isn't like you.

101
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,278
Placing blind faith in someone.

102
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:32,112
Nevertheless, he is still Taera's brother.

103
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:35,195
He may already be wavering.

104
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,496
[chuckles]

105
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,483
Good evening, Mother Director.

106
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:05,938
Excellent work. You did well.

107
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:08,015
Thank you.

108
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,945
Everything went well?
Anything new to report?

109
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:14,111
Nothing, ma'am.

110
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:22,121
Careful how you act around Pyo,
and be discreet.

111
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:25,539
He will be the one to provide us…

112
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:31,972
with great power.

113
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:40,095
<i>Just think of it as a gift from a sister.</i>

114

[stomps]

115
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:49,114
We're only keeping Hong Taera alive
during Mr. Pyo's campaign.

116
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,570
What will happen to her?
Will she end up like Hong Yura?

117
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,203
Will Pyo eventually-- [grunts]

118
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:05,785
Mr. Pyo seems to have a talent
for reading people's minds.

119
00:11:08,043 --> 00:11:11,173
If you can't resent her,
then hide your attachment to her.

120
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,514
If I see you get weak again,
that bitch No. 50…

121
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:20,932
will be gone for good.

122
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:36,032
How can I believe you, Mr. Uhm?

123
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:39,492
You killed Jaehyun's mother
on my father's orders?

124
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:42,788
There's not an ounce of falsehood in it.

125
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:45,409
So why are you telling me this, huh?

126
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:47,294
What are you telling me to do?

127
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:48,634
Stop digging.

128
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:53,086
If you delve deeper into this with Ms. Ko,
you'll put Kumjo at risk.

129
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,102

What do we do?

00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:07,483
[press clamoring]

133
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,230
This is so unfair.

134
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:11,982
I had one meal with him. One meal!

135
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,815
Of course, I know.

136
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:17,071
But the reporters have caught on to this.

137
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,948
This will cause quite a commotion.
Take a look.

138
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,370
This was in my car?

139
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,076
I knew nothing of it.

140
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,376
Chairman Song's men must've snuck it in.
How should I have known?

141
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:39,382
You know me.
I'm a totally transparent man.

142
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:43,010
Nothing happened.
These are baseless accusations.

143
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,846
This reeks of political slander.

144
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:48,981
Chairman Song was a total stranger.
We met for the first time that day.

145
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,020
- [journalist 1] Are you innocent, sir?
- [journalist 2] Please clarify!

146
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:54,484
- Had you never seen him before?
- Give us one comment.

00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:58,240
[press clamoring]

148
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,945
I smell something fishy.

149
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:03,491
This level of scrutiny
isn't a coincidence.

150
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:07,535
Clearly, there is something
behind Chairman Song's death.

151
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,790
Jang Kummo called for a press conference.

152
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:13,843
I believe he intends to expose something
about Pyo's late mother.

153
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,298
He'll be doing us a favor.

154
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:17,958
Once the public's attention shifts
to Pyo's family history,

155
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:19,508
we'll launch a counterattack.

156
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:21,008
Is that so?

157
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,970
- Could Kumjo be my new sponsor?
- Congratulations, sir.

158
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:28,852
Would you look at th--

159
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:32,103

Seems Father is really willing
to help us out

161
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:37,398
if he's holding a press conference.

162
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:41,738
You've been acting strange
since yesterday.

163
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:42,911
Something happen?

164
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:46,736
No, it's all good.

165
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:52,334
I know you're anxious,
but you'll have to brace yourself.

166
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:55,335
Things will never be the same again
between us and Jaehyun.

Thank you all for coming
despite your busy schedules.

171
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:32,246
I believe I owe you the truth.

172
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:37,497
KDP leader Han Kyungrok's claims

173
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,835
slightly differ from the truth.

174
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:47,642
Dr. Kim Sohye devoted
her whole life to research

175
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:49,561
and never cared for status.

176
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:52,431
She never pocketed any research funds.

177
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:57,898
I find it deeply regrettable that
such a skilled doctor has fallen victim

185
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:17,749
Is this your official statement of support
for Candidate Pyo?

186
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:22,764
I'm only a businessman
and have nothing to do with politics.

187

I've simply

You truly are incredible, Father.
How could you blindside us like this?

Have you struck a deal with Pyo Jaehyun,
by any chance?

How dare you raise your voice here.

199
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:02,589
This was the first time
I asked for your help, Father.

200
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:04,881
I have the right to ask, don't I?

201
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,424
I am a part of Kumjo too!

202
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:08,888
But have you ever once
considered me family?

203
00:16:10,345 --> 00:16:12,925
I'm not asking you
to concoct a false narrative

204
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:14,434
but only to speak the truth.

205
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:17,016
How could you ruin everything like this?

206
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:19,522
Does Jaehyun have something on you?

207
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:21,154
Shut your mouth!

208
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,612
Get out of my sight this instant.

209
00:16:25,527 --> 00:16:27,277
I was a fool to trust you.

210
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:30,031
I will never ask you for help again.

211
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,420
What are you doing?

212
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:44,669
Aren't you going to chase after your wife?

213
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:48,378
Why'd you do it?

214
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:52,852
What? You want to lecture me too?

215
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:54,890
I have no regrets.

216
00:16:55,557 --> 00:16:58,437
I did my absolute best for you and Kumjo.

217
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:01,518
Nobody can argue with me about that.

00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:14,413
I know all about how you killed
Dr. Kim Sohye.

221
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:18,040
Isn't that why Jaehyun
is blackmailing you?

222
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:21,458
That's why you put up
that shit show of a press conference.

223
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:31,086
Jaehyun approached me for one purpose,
to exact revenge on you.

224
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:34,184
Why have you done something
so consequential? Why?

225
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:39,768
Did that punk let the cat
out of the bag already?

226
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:42,099
Rotten bastard.

227
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:46,729
What's past is past.
Resentment won't undo anything.

228
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:51,736
This is where it gets crucial.

229
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:55,242
If that bastard Jaehyun
becomes the president,

230
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:57,789
it'll truly be the end of Kumjo.

231
00:17:58,286 --> 00:18:01,746
We must work together
to take him down, understood?

232
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:05,171
How on earth do we do that?
He has your life hanging by a thread.

233
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:08,758
Take over Kumjo immediately.

under Kyojin's name.

was up to something,

so I had this prepared long ago.

Kumjo is secure in our hands.

00:33:39,978 --> 00:33:41,728
It's already been seven years.

475
00:33:41,813 --> 00:33:44,193
He'll never find her. You have my word.

476
00:33:44,774 --> 00:33:47,864
Yeah, you're right. I don't know a thing.

477
00:33:49,404 --> 00:33:53,454
All you have to worry about
is getting Kyojin to wake up.

478
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:57,580
That's the only way the smart patch
becomes a complete success.

479
00:33:58,705 --> 00:34:02,165
The next leader of Hatch is you,
Koo Sungchan.

480
00:34:02,667 --> 00:34:05,457
Let's show them who you are, yeah?

481
00:34:09,049 --> 00:34:10,799
You're so full of shit. [laughs]

482
00:34:39,913 --> 00:34:42,623
Sorry to meet you
under these circumstances, Ms. Min.

483
00:34:42,707 --> 00:34:44,787
I trust you kept this a secret,

484
00:34:44,876 --> 00:34:45,876
even from Jaehyun?

485
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,310
Kyojin.

486
00:35:11,027 --> 00:35:13,277
[gasps] Kyojin!

487
00:35:15,907 --> 00:35:16,907
Mother.

488
00:35:19,285 --> 00:35:21,245
Is this a dream?

489
00:35:21,329 --> 00:35:24,499
Are you really my son Kyojin? [cries]

490
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:29,090
Thank you! Thank you so much!

491
00:35:31,256 --> 00:35:35,136
I knew you'd walk again.
I knew you'd survive.

492
00:35:35,218 --> 00:35:37,888
Of course you wouldn't leave me behind.

493
00:35:38,722 --> 00:35:40,522
[crying] It's all thanks to you, Mother.

494
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:44,560
Thank you for never giving up on me.

495
00:35:45,061 --> 00:35:48,231
[cries] What kind of mother
would give up on her child

496
00:35:49,691 --> 00:35:51,151
when he's perfectly fine,

497
00:35:52,652 --> 00:35:54,032
when he's alive?

498
00:35:54,779 --> 00:35:56,239
[both panting]

499
00:35:56,322 --> 00:35:57,702
You think you can move?

500
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,450
Let's get out of here.
Ms. Eun's waiting outside.

501
00:36:02,537 --> 00:36:05,827
- First, let's get you to the Jeju villa--
- No, Mother.

502
00:36:06,791 --> 00:36:10,091
The rehab system at Hatch
is much better than any hospital's.

503
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:12,460
I'll recover faster here.

504
00:36:13,173 --> 00:36:15,513
And there's something
I need to figure out.

505
00:36:15,592 --> 00:36:18,092
What on earth do you need to figure out?

506
00:36:18,178 --> 00:36:21,348
And why are you keeping this
from Jaehyun and Sungchan?

507
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,770
They're both trying to help you.

508
00:36:24,392 --> 00:36:26,852
They've been waiting for you to wake up.

509
00:36:27,354 --> 00:36:28,564
Mother,

510
00:36:30,357 --> 00:36:32,567
they're the ones who made me like this.

511
00:36:34,986 --> 00:36:35,986
What?

512
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:41,160
So don't trust anyone
until the whole truth is revealed.

513
00:36:41,743 --> 00:36:43,243
[gasping]

514
00:36:45,497 --> 00:36:49,127
What about Sujeong?
Where is she right now?

515
00:36:51,002 --> 00:36:52,882
She disappeared without a trace.

516
00:36:54,798 --> 00:36:56,258
She disappeared?

517
00:36:56,341 --> 00:36:59,091
I've been looking for her
since your accident,

518
00:36:59,177 --> 00:37:01,347
but it's like she vanished into thin air.

519
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:04,020
Mother, we have to find her.

520
00:37:04,808 --> 00:37:07,688
She holds the key to the truth
behind the accident.

521
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,310
I would do anything for you.

522
00:37:11,022 --> 00:37:12,322
Anything at all. Anything.

523
00:37:12,399 --> 00:37:14,109
[both cry]

524
00:37:14,192 --> 00:37:18,612
Anything at all.
I'll find her for you. I'll find her.

525
00:37:27,372 --> 00:37:30,042
[breathing heavily]

526
00:37:31,042 --> 00:37:32,712
Are you all right, Ms. Min?

527
00:37:34,546 --> 00:37:37,966
Aren't you Pyo Jaehyun's wife?

528
00:37:38,925 --> 00:37:41,675
Why are you helping us
without telling him any of this?

529
00:37:44,556 --> 00:37:46,386
I want to protect Kyojin.

530
00:37:48,977 --> 00:37:50,937
I'll explain everything later.

531
00:37:52,355 --> 00:37:55,815
Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me.

532
00:38:09,539 --> 00:38:11,709
[grunts, sighs]

533
00:38:39,486 --> 00:38:42,066
<i>Dojin tampered with Kyojin's brakes</i>
<i>on purpose.</i>

534
00:38:42,155 --> 00:38:43,405
So it was Dojin after all.

535
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:46,160
I don't deserve your forgiveness, Kyojin!

536
00:38:46,242 --> 00:38:48,872
<i>After all I'd done to steal Kumjo…</i>
<i>I hope you understand, Kyojin.</i>

537
00:38:48,953 --> 00:38:50,253
<i>I'll catch up with you soon.</i>

538
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:53,290
And if you send Mother to that hospital
ever again, you and I are done.

539
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:56,915
The only real family you have
is your father.

540
00:38:57,003 --> 00:39:00,553
Jaehyun, Kyojin just opened his eyes.

541
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:03,930
<i>Why do you trust Jaehyun, Mother?</i>

542
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:06,510
<i>What in the world happened</i>
<i>while I was in a coma?</i>

543
00:39:07,138 --> 00:39:11,268
I won't share human trial results
with anyone for now. I'll do it on my own.

544
00:39:11,351 --> 00:39:13,141
- Will you be okay?
- Don't trust me?

545
00:39:13,228 --> 00:39:16,358
All right. Suit yourself.
As you said, Kyojin's top priority.

546
00:39:16,439 --> 00:39:18,569
Thanks for understanding.

547
00:39:19,317 --> 00:39:22,357
<i>You're trying to wake me up</i>

It's me, Sungchan.

551
00:39:29,953 --> 00:39:32,793
Who did this to you? Is it Dojin?

552
00:39:33,707 --> 00:39:35,827
Then is it… Jaehyun?

553
00:39:45,427 --> 00:39:47,007
I'm going to expose all of you.

554
00:39:48,221 --> 00:39:51,641
I'll make you all regret
ever waking me up.

[Park] <i>I had a feeling</i>

[snaps finger] <i>and I got him.</i>

<i>I found records</i>
<i>of off-the-books purchases.</i>

What did you find?

565
00:40:59,584 --> 00:41:01,504
<i>A contract and a copy of his passport.</i>

566

<i>If you send the money,</i>
<i>they say they'll ship it today.</i>

567
00:41:04,631 --> 00:41:07,681
I'll wire the money immediately.
Have them send it right away.

568
00:41:09,135 --> 00:41:11,715
Great work, Mr. Park. Thank you so much.

569
00:41:11,805 --> 00:41:13,215
I really appreciate it.

<i>No problem.</i>
<i>I'll text you their bank information.</i>

571
00:41:21,022 --> 00:41:24,282
You hear that?
Mr. Park found Jake Company.

572
00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:28,029
Once we get our hands on the files,
we'll find out who bought the jewelry.

573
00:41:29,989 --> 00:41:31,829
How will I ever repay Mr. Park?

574
00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:33,620
Yeah, you're right.

575
00:41:35,203 --> 00:41:36,793
[No. 50] Do I have to attend?

576
00:41:37,497 --> 00:41:38,957
Jaehyun didn't mention it.

577
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,580
Of course you have to go.

578
00:41:41,668 --> 00:41:45,758
Why should we let Han get
all the attention from business leaders?

579
00:41:47,424 --> 00:41:51,554
Also, I hear they're all bringing
their wives tonight.

580
00:41:51,636 --> 00:41:55,176
They're obviously trying to pick a fight.

581
00:41:55,265 --> 00:42:00,435
But if you don't go,
it's going to be a TKO for Mr. Pyo.

582

Is it really acute myocardial infarction

Yes, that's how they've closed the case.

But only he was affected
when he barely had any?

They say everyone has different reactions.

Well, I'm looking at nearby surveillance
footage, but there's nothing much.

She'd been obsessed
with finding the suspect all this time.

Haesoo can never know the truth.

I'm feeling tired.

787
01:00:25,041 --> 01:00:27,881
{\an8}Block the exits!

788
01:00:27,961 --> 01:00:29,921
{\an8}<i>We have nothing to do</i>
<i>with her death, do we?</i>

789
01:00:30,005 --> 01:00:32,505
{\an8}<i>This is our last chance</i>
<i>to cut ties with Hanwool.</i>

790
01:00:33,425 --> 01:00:35,755
{\an8}<i>I don't want to live</i>
<i>as your creation of Hong Taera.</i>

791
01:00:35,844 --> 01:00:37,354
{\an8}Give it all up.

792
01:00:37,429 --> 01:00:38,809
{\an8}What the hell did you do to my father?

793
01:00:38,888 --> 01:00:41,558
{\an8}- Are you really going to kill your father?
- [screams]

794
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:45,810
{\an8}I'm going to reveal
all of our father's sins.

795
01:00:46,396 --> 01:00:50,186
{\an8}<i>Haesoo's suffered enough.</i>
<i>It's time to lay her down to rest.</i>

796
01:00:50,275 --> 01:00:52,935
<i>So she can finally see her parents again.</i>
