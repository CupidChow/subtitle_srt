00:00:00,073 --> 00:00:05,907
PANDORA: BENEATH THE PARADISE

2
00:00:05,988 --> 00:00:07,078
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

3
00:00:07,159 --> 00:00:08,396
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

4
00:00:08,477 --> 00:00:09,663
SCENES INVOLVING ANIMALS WERE
CREATED WITH PROPS AND VISUAL EFFECTS

5
00:00:09,744 --> 00:00:10,865
AND CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED SAFELY
WITH THE PRESENCE OF THEIR GUARDIANS

6
00:00:11,505 --> 00:00:12,923
You still haven't found her?

7
00:00:13,883 --> 00:00:16,719
Dr. Yang, that bitch.
Where the hell is she hiding?

8
00:00:43,954 --> 00:00:45,539
No!

9
00:00:50,961 --> 00:00:52,463
Taera! Taera!

10
00:01:11,565 --> 00:01:13,400
Taera!

11
00:01:14,068 --> 00:01:16,529
No! Taera!

12
00:01:16,612 --> 00:01:19,198
- Candidate Pyo!
- No, Taera!

13
00:01:20,282 --> 00:01:21,283
No.

14
00:01:22,076 --> 00:01:23,410
Let go! Let go!

15
00:01:23,494 --> 00:01:24,829
Let go of me!

16
00:01:26,747 --> 00:01:28,916
Pyo Jaehyun, you evil bastard.

17
00:01:29,708 --> 00:01:33,212
The whole world will hear
all about the atrocities you committed.

18
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:36,507
- I'll call the police, sir.
- That won't be necessary.

19
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,342
Take care of my wife first. Quick!

20
00:01:38,425 --> 00:01:39,552
Yes-- Yes, sir.

21
00:01:40,678 --> 00:01:44,431
Ms. Hong, wake up!

22
00:01:44,515 --> 00:01:45,933
Your brother, he--

23
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,735
Taera-- Taera. Damn it.

24
00:02:09,874 --> 00:02:11,584
Let go! Let go of me!

25
00:02:11,667 --> 00:02:13,085
I need to see if she's okay.

26
00:02:14,545 --> 00:02:17,423
Do you want Jaehyun to catch you?
Think about it!

27
00:02:21,343 --> 00:02:23,554
Mr. Jang Dojin?
I found Haesoo, come quick.

28
00:02:29,351 --> 00:02:30,978
We'll handle the situation here.

29
00:02:40,613 --> 00:02:42,698
Huh? Where's that woman?

30
00:02:42,781 --> 00:02:44,116
Where'd she go?

31
00:03:04,345 --> 00:03:05,763
What-- What happened?

32
00:03:07,473 --> 00:03:08,307
EPISODE 14

33
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,518
Ms. Hong was injured
and taken to the hospital.

34
00:03:11,352 --> 00:03:12,436
It's my fault.

35
00:03:14,188 --> 00:03:17,233
I meant to kill Jaehyun…

36
00:03:17,316 --> 00:03:18,984
…but she tried to protect him.

37
00:03:20,027 --> 00:03:21,487
Don't-- Don't tell me.

38
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,030
Did you shoot her, Haesoo?

39
00:03:23,906 --> 00:03:26,659
The bullet just grazed her.
It shouldn't be anything serious.

40
00:03:27,201 --> 00:03:28,202
More importantly,

41
00:03:28,828 --> 00:03:32,623
someone tried to run
over Jaehyun with a truck.

42
00:03:33,249 --> 00:03:36,210
What-- What? So what about Taera?
Is she hurt badly?

43
00:03:36,293 --> 00:03:37,962
I'm about to go to the hospital.

44
00:03:38,504 --> 00:03:39,588
I'll call you.

45
00:03:40,381 --> 00:03:41,715
Please take care of Haesoo.

46
00:03:50,391 --> 00:03:51,392
You okay?

47
00:03:54,728 --> 00:03:56,480
I must've had gone mad.

48
00:03:59,567 --> 00:04:01,402
I almost killed Taera.

49
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:05,865
What if she doesn't recover from this?
What do I do then?

50
00:04:08,409 --> 00:04:11,620
She'll be fine.
Nothing will happen to Taera.

51
00:04:13,914 --> 00:04:15,833
I think I've gone too far.

52
00:04:17,334 --> 00:04:19,044
All this for the truth?

53
00:04:19,128 --> 00:04:20,671
All this for revenge?

54
00:04:22,506 --> 00:04:24,633
I should've just left Taera alone.

55
00:04:25,426 --> 00:04:29,555
I should've left her to live
in ignorant bliss, next to Jaehyun.

56
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:31,140
No, that's--

57
00:04:31,849 --> 00:04:34,351
But that's not the life Taera wants.

58
00:04:34,852 --> 00:04:38,439
You were only trying to save her,
so none of this is your fault.

59
00:04:48,365 --> 00:04:49,366
Haesoo.

60
00:04:53,287 --> 00:04:55,789
Bone fractures and abrasions
have been treated.

61
00:04:55,873 --> 00:04:58,501
It was a narrow miss.
The shot could've been fatal.

62
00:04:59,585 --> 00:05:00,586
And her brain?

63
00:05:01,212 --> 00:05:03,172
We'll have to check the scan results,

64
00:05:03,255 --> 00:05:06,091
but her condition may worsen
from the impact of the fall.

65
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:08,636
You mean, the chip's side effects
might progress faster?

66
00:05:08,719 --> 00:05:10,262
It's certainly possible.

67
00:05:10,346 --> 00:05:11,347
Sir.

68
00:05:22,149 --> 00:05:24,860
Sir, about the woman at the scene.

69
00:05:24,944 --> 00:05:26,904
She was Hatch's Dr. Yang Sejin, right?

70
00:05:26,987 --> 00:05:29,323
- The woman who worked with you.
- Yes.

71
00:05:29,406 --> 00:05:31,867
She just suddenly disappeared.

72
00:05:31,951 --> 00:05:33,786
- Perhaps--
- I'll take care of it.

73
00:05:34,495 --> 00:05:36,413
Let's not cause a commotion
before the election.

74
00:05:36,497 --> 00:05:39,375
Make sure the staff and the security
keep a tight lip.

75
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:42,503
The reporters are here already.

76
00:05:42,586 --> 00:05:44,713
We've tried to keep them out, but…

77
00:05:45,631 --> 00:05:47,716
- One comment.
- Please, just one.

78
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,760
- He's coming out!
- What?

79
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:54,014
- Was there an incident at the townhouse?
- A terrorist?

80
00:05:54,098 --> 00:05:56,892
- A planned attack?
- Was Ms. Hong injured, trying to save you?

81
00:05:56,976 --> 00:06:00,312
It wasn't anything fatal.
Nor was it a terrorist attack.

82
00:06:00,396 --> 00:06:03,357
It was merely a small incident
caused by an obsessed fan of mine.

83
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,484
Of course, nobody got hurt.

84
00:06:05,568 --> 00:06:08,487
My wife's just resting.
She was startled after all.

85
00:06:08,571 --> 00:06:10,865
So I ask you
not to blow things out of proportion.

86
00:06:10,948 --> 00:06:13,075
We were told a gun went off, sir.

87
00:06:15,035 --> 00:06:16,036
Not at all.

88
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,121
All right, then.

89
00:06:17,204 --> 00:06:19,165
- How's your wife doing, sir?
- Mr. Pyo!

90
00:06:19,248 --> 00:06:21,083
- Will she wake up?
- Is she okay--

91
00:06:21,167 --> 00:06:22,001
YBC PARK JUNHO

92
00:06:22,084 --> 00:06:24,587
<i>He was lying through this teeth,</i>
<i>never batted an eye.</i>

93
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:25,796
<i>Shameless prick.</i>

94
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,464
Are you sure she's okay?

95
00:06:27,548 --> 00:06:29,466
She's not showing any symptoms yet.

96
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:33,429
They're waiting for her scan results.
So don't worry too much.

97
00:06:33,929 --> 00:06:35,598
I'll call when the results are out.

98
00:06:38,184 --> 00:06:39,643
I need to see her for myself.

99
00:06:40,352 --> 00:06:41,937
She's not her normal self.

100
00:06:42,021 --> 00:06:44,773
What if something goes wrong
with the chip in her brain?

101
00:06:44,857 --> 00:06:46,025
Wait.

102
00:06:48,777 --> 00:06:50,988
Jaehyun won't leave her side.
Let's go together.

103
00:06:52,531 --> 00:06:55,117
Candidate Pyo's wife is in the hospital.

104
00:06:55,201 --> 00:06:56,494
Have you heard?

105
00:06:56,994 --> 00:06:58,954
Rumor has it
that it was a terrorist attack.

106
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:03,542
Jaehyun, that prick, just can't stop
making enemies.

107
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:08,339
This is an opportunity.

108
00:07:08,422 --> 00:07:10,841
The heavens have granted you

109
00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:13,344
an opportunity of a lifetime.

110
00:07:13,427 --> 00:07:17,389
I've always admired your foresight.

111
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:20,017
Do you have a brilliant plan in mind?

112
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,560
Free college education.

113
00:07:22,061 --> 00:07:24,021
You have Kumjo's support.

114
00:07:24,104 --> 00:07:26,482
Announce your new platform,
and take the win.

115
00:07:27,191 --> 00:07:30,653
If I make the move,
other conglomerates will take heed.

116
00:07:31,237 --> 00:07:34,365
They'd take heed of your noble character
when you're president.

117
00:07:36,826 --> 00:07:39,245
The election is just around the corner.

118
00:07:39,328 --> 00:07:41,997
Will a new platform be able
to sway public sentiment?

119
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:44,875
The public remembers
a candidate's platforms.

120
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:49,129
As you know, a platform like that
will stay with me for life.

121
00:07:49,213 --> 00:07:52,842
You can worry about that
after you're elected.

122
00:07:52,925 --> 00:07:54,885
Until you sign your name as president

123
00:07:54,969 --> 00:07:58,055
in the National Cemetery's guest book,

124
00:07:58,973 --> 00:08:01,767
I'll fund your campaign.

125
00:08:02,476 --> 00:08:06,188
I, Jang Kummo, would never
make a losing transaction.

126
00:08:07,565 --> 00:08:08,691
Trust me this once.

127
00:08:30,588 --> 00:08:31,589
You awake?

128
00:08:32,214 --> 00:08:33,215
Do you recognize me?

129
00:08:35,926 --> 00:08:37,094
What happened, honey?

130
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,972
I remember a truck running toward us.

131
00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:45,352
Why did you do it? Why did you jump
in front of me like that?

132
00:08:45,436 --> 00:08:46,687
You almost died, you know.

133
00:08:47,646 --> 00:08:49,023
Don't do it again.

134
00:08:49,106 --> 00:08:51,025
I couldn't bear it if the worst happened.

135
00:08:51,108 --> 00:08:55,279
I had no time to think,
except to realize that you were in danger.

136
00:08:56,697 --> 00:08:59,658
By the way, who was driving the truck?

137
00:09:00,784 --> 00:09:01,911
It was Dr. Yang.

138
00:09:01,994 --> 00:09:04,121
Why would Dr. Yang do such a thing?

139
00:09:04,205 --> 00:09:06,999
She was recently caught stealing
Hatch's primary research data,

140
00:09:07,082 --> 00:09:08,083
so I fired her.

141
00:09:09,001 --> 00:09:10,461
I think she resents me for that.

142
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:12,922
What happened to her?

143
00:09:14,298 --> 00:09:16,425
I'll take care of it, so don't you worry.

144
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:19,220
Just take care of yourself, okay?

145
00:09:20,721 --> 00:09:21,931
I'm fine.

146
00:09:23,724 --> 00:09:24,725
By the way,

147
00:09:25,601 --> 00:09:28,521
I think I saw a glimpse of Haesoo earlier.

148
00:09:30,147 --> 00:09:32,733
Why would she be there?
Sure you're not mistaken?

149
00:09:34,902 --> 00:09:36,946
- Ow--
- Oh, no. I'm sorry.

150
00:09:37,571 --> 00:09:38,739
You need to rest.

151
00:09:39,323 --> 00:09:41,033
Should I ask for more painkillers?

152
00:09:45,538 --> 00:09:46,914
SUNGCHAN

153
00:09:48,499 --> 00:09:51,126
Answer the call.
I think I'll sleep some more.

154
00:09:51,877 --> 00:09:54,547
Oh, okay. Don't worry
about anything, and get some sleep.

155
00:10:00,469 --> 00:10:02,263
What is it? I'm busy.

156
00:10:02,346 --> 00:10:05,391
<i>I don't care how busy you are.</i>
<i>Get over here. It's about Dr. Yang.</i>

157
00:10:05,474 --> 00:10:07,059
<i>I'm with her right now.</i>

158
00:10:07,601 --> 00:10:09,478
<i>Or should I say Sujeong?</i>

159
00:10:25,536 --> 00:10:27,163
He left Taera alone. Where's he going?

160
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,665
You can go by yourself, right?

161
00:10:29,748 --> 00:10:32,001
- Why?
- I think I'll follow him.

162
00:10:32,918 --> 00:10:33,919
No, don't go.

163
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:37,047
Just stay here. Don't do anything.

164
00:10:38,257 --> 00:10:39,550
I'm really scared.

165
00:10:42,511 --> 00:10:45,181
Okay. I'll do as you say, Haesoo.

166
00:10:54,523 --> 00:10:55,566
<i>Ms. Hong,</i>

167
00:10:55,649 --> 00:10:57,151
wake up!

168
00:10:57,234 --> 00:10:58,527
Your brother, he--

169
00:11:01,488 --> 00:11:03,449
<i>Hajun must be in that lab.</i>

170
00:11:04,283 --> 00:11:05,910
<i>I need to find out its location.</i>

171
00:11:33,312 --> 00:11:34,313
Taera.

172
00:11:37,441 --> 00:11:38,442
Haesoo?

173
00:11:39,193 --> 00:11:40,486
How did you get in here?

174
00:11:43,155 --> 00:11:44,865
I came to see if you were okay.

175
00:11:46,242 --> 00:11:47,618
I'm sorry.

176
00:11:47,701 --> 00:11:49,703
You almost died because of me.

177
00:11:50,955 --> 00:11:52,206
I'm really sorry.

178
00:11:55,709 --> 00:11:58,087
I told myself I was doing it for you

179
00:11:59,004 --> 00:12:01,632
because you'd never be happy with him.

180
00:12:03,676 --> 00:12:05,427
But I don't want to lose you.

181
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:09,807
If you say you're happy now,
I'm fine with that.

182
00:12:10,933 --> 00:12:13,185
Even if your memories don't return,

183
00:12:13,686 --> 00:12:16,105
I just don't want you to suffer anymore.

184
00:12:18,107 --> 00:12:19,483
That's all I want.

185
00:12:20,484 --> 00:12:21,485
That's all.

186
00:12:24,446 --> 00:12:25,906
Don't be silly. Stop crying.

187
00:12:27,616 --> 00:12:28,993
I remember everything.

188
00:12:30,411 --> 00:12:32,079
Our conversations.

189
00:12:32,955 --> 00:12:36,000
Our plans to get rid of Pyo Jaehyun.

190
00:12:37,835 --> 00:12:39,253
And how you forgave me.

191
00:12:41,255 --> 00:12:43,132
I remember every single thing.

192
00:12:46,135 --> 00:12:48,846
Then why didn't you tell me?

193
00:12:48,929 --> 00:12:53,017
I couldn't put you at risk anymore.

194
00:12:56,187 --> 00:12:58,105
But I didn't think you'd go so far.

195
00:13:01,233 --> 00:13:03,569
It must've been hard
to face it alone, Haesoo.

196
00:13:05,696 --> 00:13:06,697
I'm sorry.

197
00:13:08,449 --> 00:13:10,618
No, I'm sorry.

198
00:13:11,535 --> 00:13:12,912
It's my fault.

199
00:13:15,164 --> 00:13:17,416
On my way here, I kept praying

200
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,420
that I'd stop my revenge,
if it meant you'd be safe.

201
00:13:23,547 --> 00:13:25,174
I won't do anything anymore.

202
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:30,054
I don't need to take revenge at the price
of losing someone I care about.

203
00:13:32,181 --> 00:13:33,349
I want to stop now.

204
00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:38,270
Haesoo.

205
00:13:57,206 --> 00:13:59,750
What-- What? You gonna kill me?

206
00:13:59,834 --> 00:14:01,544
Yeah, let's not do that.

207
00:14:02,461 --> 00:14:04,880
One tap of this button,

208
00:14:04,964 --> 00:14:08,092
and every camera here will go live
for the whole world to see.

209
00:14:08,175 --> 00:14:09,301
I'm tech-savvy, you know.

210
00:14:09,927 --> 00:14:11,512
You bastard.

211
00:14:11,595 --> 00:14:12,429
Move.

212
00:14:20,312 --> 00:14:21,355
Sungchan!

213
00:14:21,438 --> 00:14:23,440
I'm Park Sujeong, I'm Sujeong!

214
00:14:24,108 --> 00:14:25,109
Oh, dear.

215
00:14:30,781 --> 00:14:32,783
Thought I followed Dr. Yang here.

216
00:14:32,867 --> 00:14:35,578
But, my goodness. It's Sujeong.

217
00:14:36,453 --> 00:14:39,540
Hey, what the hell have you been up to
behind our backs?

218
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:44,128
So, is this why your achievements
have been so exceptional?

219
00:14:45,212 --> 00:14:48,507
I have to say,
disguising Sujeong as Dr. Yang,

220
00:14:48,591 --> 00:14:51,385
then putting her in charge
of the secret lab?

221
00:14:51,468 --> 00:14:52,469
Now that's genius.

222
00:14:52,553 --> 00:14:55,222
Pyo Jaehyun, you're the shit.

223
00:14:56,056 --> 00:15:00,436
Wow, how'd you think to build a lab here?

224
00:15:01,312 --> 00:15:02,563
You're a fucking lunatic.

225
00:15:03,355 --> 00:15:05,232
By the way,

226
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,651
does the landowner know?

227
00:15:08,152 --> 00:15:11,113
Does she know you're up to
frightening shit on her property?

228
00:15:11,197 --> 00:15:12,489
Whoa.

229
00:15:15,701 --> 00:15:16,702
Watch your mouth,

230
00:15:17,453 --> 00:15:18,871
unless you want to die here.

231
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:22,166
You've been having fun
all by yourself, huh?

232
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:26,962
You had Dr. Yang test out
all of Hatch's research theories,

233
00:15:27,046 --> 00:15:29,215
and then, you'd boast
about the results to us.

234
00:15:29,882 --> 00:15:32,760
Hey, the dude in room six.

235
00:15:32,843 --> 00:15:35,054
Isn't that fella Taera's bodyguard?

236
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,681
Why did he end up in here?

237
00:15:39,183 --> 00:15:40,309
I'll get to the point.

238
00:15:40,851 --> 00:15:44,104
When I'm elected,
human experimentation will be legalized.

239
00:15:44,188 --> 00:15:46,398
Until then, this is my temporary lab.

240
00:15:47,066 --> 00:15:51,487
You realize this was a necessary risk
to perfect the smart patch, don't you?

241
00:15:52,363 --> 00:15:53,322
Not really.

242
00:15:53,864 --> 00:15:54,949
Anyway,

243
00:15:55,032 --> 00:15:58,244
someone will have to take
the reins of these human experiments.

244
00:15:59,453 --> 00:16:02,414
As you can see,
Dr. Yang's health has deteriorated,

245
00:16:02,915 --> 00:16:04,291
and she's done her part.

246
00:16:04,792 --> 00:16:06,001
So you take the reins.

247
00:16:06,585 --> 00:16:08,712
Take over the future human experiments.

248
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:10,840
No.

249
00:16:14,051 --> 00:16:16,470
Minister of Future Technology.

250
00:16:16,554 --> 00:16:17,555
Will that suffice?

251
00:16:18,264 --> 00:16:22,643
Man, I'm honestly not cut out
to be a civil servant,

252
00:16:23,978 --> 00:16:26,438
but I'll think about it.

253
00:16:26,939 --> 00:16:31,527
Jaehyun, I truly hope our friendship
never changes.

254
00:16:32,903 --> 00:16:33,904
I'm off.

255
00:16:34,864 --> 00:16:37,950
See you next time. Goodbye.

256
00:16:38,033 --> 00:16:38,868
Oh, man.

257
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,250
Excuse me, sir.

258
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,212
Sample six is ready to be tested.
Shall I proceed?

259
00:17:00,931 --> 00:17:02,266
What are you doing to me?

260
00:17:03,934 --> 00:17:06,896
Let's see how much stimuli
your cranial nerves can withstand.

261
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,025
I'm in a bad mood today.

262
00:17:11,108 --> 00:17:12,610
Do your best to hang in there.

263
00:17:16,113 --> 00:17:18,908
You do this to my sister too,
you crazy bastard?

264
00:17:18,991 --> 00:17:20,576
To Taera?

265
00:17:21,076 --> 00:17:23,454
I only left happy memories in her head.

266
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,666
Her filthy and painful memories
of you or Kim Seondeok

267
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,043
were all wiped clean.

268
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:34,507
Whether they're memories of misery
or her painful past,

269
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:36,425
it's up to her to embrace them all.

270
00:17:37,009 --> 00:17:39,136
You had no right to erase them.

271
00:17:40,346 --> 00:17:43,599
My sister will never be happy with you.

272
00:17:43,682 --> 00:17:45,809
My sister, my sister, my sister!

273
00:17:45,893 --> 00:17:47,561
Who's your sister?

274
00:17:48,062 --> 00:17:49,313
Hey.

275
00:17:49,396 --> 00:17:52,274
Shut him up so he never utters
those words again, got it?

276
00:17:53,067 --> 00:17:54,068
Yes, sir.

277
00:18:05,246 --> 00:18:08,123
It's such a relief
Taera didn't lose her memory.

278
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:13,170
Once she's discharged,
let's discuss our next move.

279
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:16,382
I think I need rest.

280
00:18:29,937 --> 00:18:31,981
KYOJIN

281
00:18:35,025 --> 00:18:37,820
Why would Dr. Yang do that?

282
00:18:39,655 --> 00:18:40,656
Dr. Yang

283
00:18:41,615 --> 00:18:42,616
is Sujeong.

284
00:18:44,827 --> 00:18:45,828
What-- What?

285
00:18:46,829 --> 00:18:49,832
What? That-- That's impossible.

286
00:18:49,915 --> 00:18:50,916
Why's that?

287
00:18:51,834 --> 00:18:53,502
Because she died seven years ago?

288
00:18:54,378 --> 00:18:56,172
Because of your secret experiment?

289
00:18:56,881 --> 00:18:59,216
No, that-- That's--

290
00:18:59,884 --> 00:19:02,303
Did I not give you a chance to confess?

291
00:19:02,386 --> 00:19:04,972
Did you think you could hide it
to the end?

292
00:19:06,056 --> 00:19:08,934
I-- I'm sorry, Kyojin.
I-- I didn't have the courage.

293
00:19:09,018 --> 00:19:11,145
I was afraid I'd lose everything I have.

294
00:19:12,396 --> 00:19:13,731
I'm really sorry.

295
00:19:13,814 --> 00:19:15,691
If you're sorry, you better find her.

296
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:18,903
Find her, and apologize to her yourself.

297
00:19:25,409 --> 00:19:26,410
Huh?

298
00:19:29,288 --> 00:19:31,999
That's Sungchan's car.

299
00:19:32,082 --> 00:19:33,125
Was he tailing her?

300
00:19:33,209 --> 00:19:36,045
Does he know that Dr. Yang is Sujeong too?

301
00:19:36,629 --> 00:19:38,464
If he succeeded in tailing her,

302
00:19:39,548 --> 00:19:42,635
he might know where she is right now.

303
00:19:47,848 --> 00:19:49,517
It's late. Why aren't you home?

304
00:19:50,017 --> 00:19:53,312
Did you go to the hospital
where Hong Taera is?

305
00:19:53,395 --> 00:19:55,981
I'm at Dojin's.
I had something to do here.

306
00:19:56,065 --> 00:19:57,483
And what would that be?

307
00:19:57,566 --> 00:20:00,569
Tomorrow, Father will be summoned
by the prosecution.

308
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,988
As the mastermind
behind Ko's assassination.

309
00:20:03,531 --> 00:20:05,491
Kyojin!

310
00:20:05,574 --> 00:20:06,951
I ruined Haesoo's life.

311
00:20:07,034 --> 00:20:09,203
I have to save her.
I can't lose her like this!

312
00:20:09,286 --> 00:20:11,372
Why? What happened to her? What is it?

313
00:20:11,455 --> 00:20:13,833
Kyojin, help me out.

314
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:18,587
I have to bring down Father myself.

315
00:20:20,756 --> 00:20:22,049
<i>Dojin said that?</i>

316
00:20:22,132 --> 00:20:24,760
He said he'd ruin his father
with his own hands?

317
00:20:25,636 --> 00:20:26,762
I doubt that.

318
00:20:26,846 --> 00:20:28,681
Let go of your grudge against Dojin.

319
00:20:29,431 --> 00:20:31,600
He's sincerely sorry
for what he did to me.

320
00:20:31,684 --> 00:20:33,936
And you believe him?
How can you be so naïve?

321
00:20:34,019 --> 00:20:36,647
What sincerity?
Not so long ago, he wanted you dead.

322
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:39,275
It's different now.
I've forgiven him for everything.

323
00:20:39,358 --> 00:20:42,278
He wants to right his wrongs
associated with Hatch and Father.

324
00:20:42,361 --> 00:20:44,405
Don't you even pity him?

325
00:20:49,869 --> 00:20:52,830
"With Hatch and Father"?

326
00:21:04,008 --> 00:21:07,011
Why won't you listen?
I told you to stay at the hospital.

327
00:21:07,094 --> 00:21:09,555
I can't stay in bed
when the election's tomorrow.

328
00:21:10,055 --> 00:21:12,892
I'm also worried about Jiu,
and it just didn't feel right.

329
00:21:12,975 --> 00:21:14,602
Stubborn as always, huh?

330
00:21:18,189 --> 00:21:20,274
- Yes.
<i>- We have a problem, sir.</i>

331
00:21:20,983 --> 00:21:22,067
Okay.

332
00:21:23,861 --> 00:21:25,362
Sorry but I have to go.

333
00:21:25,446 --> 00:21:27,448
- Go get some more rest.
- Okay.

334
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,374
Taera.

335
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:40,920
You feeling better?

336
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,254
Yes.

337
00:21:42,338 --> 00:21:45,966
Leo is at your house,
so I came to get him.

338
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:49,011
Of course.
Why don't you come in and have some tea?

339
00:21:49,094 --> 00:21:50,137
Sure.

340
00:22:08,447 --> 00:22:10,115
What do you think you're doing?

341
00:22:10,199 --> 00:22:12,785
You tried to kill me? You of all people?

342
00:22:15,037 --> 00:22:17,248
I told you to do nothing.

343
00:22:17,957 --> 00:22:20,376
That bullet could've killed Taera.

344
00:22:20,459 --> 00:22:22,711
Jiu almost lost her mother!

345
00:22:22,795 --> 00:22:24,380
You want Taera to be miserable?

346
00:22:24,463 --> 00:22:26,257
That what you want?

347
00:22:32,054 --> 00:22:35,933
I'll show you what happens

348
00:22:37,309 --> 00:22:39,311
if you take Taera away from me.

349
00:22:52,862 --> 00:22:55,573
I bought macarons, your favorite.

350
00:22:55,657 --> 00:22:56,824
Want some?

351
00:22:56,908 --> 00:22:58,076
No.

352
00:22:59,577 --> 00:23:01,579
Here's the game pack you wanted to play.

353
00:23:01,663 --> 00:23:02,705
Do you want to play?

354
00:23:02,789 --> 00:23:04,874
I said no!

355
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:08,002
Come on, stop crying.

356
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:11,464
I'm a big boy now,
so I'll do whatever you ask.

357
00:23:12,048 --> 00:23:15,843
- Hmm? Pyo Jiu.
- Sheesh. Who are you calling a "big boy"?

358
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:18,179
Your birthday's later than mine.

359
00:23:18,262 --> 00:23:19,514
Jiu!

360
00:23:20,098 --> 00:23:21,432
Mommy!

361
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:26,479
- Mommy, you okay? Did you get hurt?
- No, Mommy's fine. See?

362
00:23:26,562 --> 00:23:29,565
Promise? You're not sick, right?

363
00:23:29,649 --> 00:23:31,859
Mommy's very strong.

364
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:35,530
So eat macarons with Leo,
and play games with him, okay?

365
00:23:35,613 --> 00:23:37,323
Okay, I won't cry anymore.

366
00:23:38,449 --> 00:23:39,701
Thank you, Leo.

367
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:47,709
Leo, go play in Jiu's room.
I'll call you later.

368
00:23:48,876 --> 00:23:51,170
I'm exhausted from comforting her.

369
00:23:51,921 --> 00:23:53,923
I don't understand women at all.

370
00:23:54,007 --> 00:23:55,591
Hey, let's go, Jang Leo.

371
00:23:55,675 --> 00:23:57,885
- Go on up.
- Whoa. I'm right behind you!

372
00:24:02,056 --> 00:24:04,434
Taera, are you okay?

373
00:24:04,517 --> 00:24:06,561
Have the side effects begun already?

374
00:24:07,645 --> 00:24:08,688
I'm fine.

375
00:24:09,605 --> 00:24:10,648
I'll be fine.

376
00:24:13,609 --> 00:24:15,069
What about Haesoo?

377
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:19,574
She hasn't come out of her room
since she visited you yesterday.

378
00:24:21,242 --> 00:24:22,535
Haesoo says

379
00:24:22,619 --> 00:24:25,538
she'll back down from trying
to reveal Chairman Jang's crimes.

380
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:27,373
She's letting it all go.

381
00:24:27,457 --> 00:24:31,377
Seeing that I left her with no choice
but to wield a gun made me see

382
00:24:31,461 --> 00:24:33,755
that I might actually lose her.

383
00:24:33,838 --> 00:24:35,423
That's when I came to my senses.

384
00:24:36,132 --> 00:24:39,510
I'm going to the prosecution later.
I'm exposing the truth.

385
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:45,308
This is a copy of the hard disk
from Hanwool's annex building.

386
00:24:45,808 --> 00:24:50,146
It contains evidence that Director Kim
ran a contract killing business.

387
00:24:51,314 --> 00:24:53,358
Including evidence
Chairman Jang was involved.

388
00:24:54,275 --> 00:24:55,860
Thank you, Taera.

389
00:24:56,444 --> 00:24:57,862
Did you find Dr. Yang?

390
00:24:57,945 --> 00:25:02,033
Oh, Kyojin's looking for the man
to whom the truck is registered.

391
00:25:02,116 --> 00:25:03,576
We're tracking him down now.

392
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,703
Jaehyun probably took her
to the secret lab.

393
00:25:06,329 --> 00:25:07,455
The secret lab?

394
00:25:07,538 --> 00:25:10,291
He's been conducting
illegal human experiments there.

395
00:25:11,584 --> 00:25:13,378
Dr. Yang had escaped from that lab.

396
00:25:15,129 --> 00:25:16,881
It's also where my brother's being held.

397
00:25:16,965 --> 00:25:18,716
I think Sungchan knows something.

398
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,259
Let's start from there.

399
00:25:20,343 --> 00:25:21,427
Oh, right.

400
00:25:22,804 --> 00:25:24,138
This is from Kyojin.

401
00:25:24,222 --> 00:25:27,475
Contact him only through this phone now.
Oh, and--

402
00:25:27,558 --> 00:25:30,103
Give this watch to Sungchan.

403
00:25:30,186 --> 00:25:31,604
It's a watch with a wiretap.

404
00:25:35,942 --> 00:25:39,195
The masters of our future,
the youth of today.

405
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:42,448
Before they even begin
to spread their hopes and dreams,

406
00:25:42,991 --> 00:25:46,286
they sit on a heap of debt
with their heads bowed low.

407
00:25:46,369 --> 00:25:48,496
But I will overlook them no longer.

408
00:25:48,579 --> 00:25:49,580
NO. 1 HAN KYUNGROK

409
00:25:49,664 --> 00:25:52,792
This is the most ambitious endeavor
of my political career:

410
00:25:52,875 --> 00:25:55,378
free college education!

411
00:25:55,461 --> 00:25:59,299
I will put my name on the line
and make it happen!

412
00:25:59,382 --> 00:26:00,717
NO. 1 WORKING CLASS PRESIDENT

413
00:26:01,301 --> 00:26:04,804
Oh, announcing a new platform
one day before the election, huh?

414
00:26:04,887 --> 00:26:05,888
HAN KYUNGROK, KDP CANDIDATE

415
00:26:05,972 --> 00:26:07,181
<i>Han Kyungrok! Han--</i>

416
00:26:09,767 --> 00:26:10,852
What do you think?

417
00:26:12,603 --> 00:26:16,190
He's definitely hitting a nerve.

418
00:26:16,274 --> 00:26:19,360
Young voters in their twenties
will flock to Han's side.

419
00:26:19,861 --> 00:26:22,697
People are talking about
yesterday's townhouse incident.

420
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,657
Reporters are still looking into it.

421
00:26:24,741 --> 00:26:25,825
NO. 7 PYO JAEHYUN

422
00:26:25,908 --> 00:26:27,952
We'll need to remedy the situation.

423
00:26:28,036 --> 00:26:30,955
This situation shouldn't be
taken lightly, sir.

424
00:26:37,003 --> 00:26:38,296
FROM CANDIDATE PYO JAEHYUN

425
00:26:38,379 --> 00:26:40,006
<i>Free college education.</i>

426
00:26:40,506 --> 00:26:42,592
<i>You have Kumjo's support.</i>

427
00:26:42,675 --> 00:26:44,802
<i>Announce your new platform,</i>
<i>and take the win.</i>

428
00:26:44,886 --> 00:26:47,138
<i>They'd take heed of your noble character…</i>

429
00:26:47,221 --> 00:26:49,057
Schedule a lunch with a few reporters,

430
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,558
and let it slip naturally,

431
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:53,269
regarding Chairman Jang
and Mr. Han's collusion.

432
00:26:54,228 --> 00:26:55,688
Don't spill too much, though.

433
00:26:56,189 --> 00:26:58,358
Just that Chairman Jang
pulled some strings.

434
00:26:58,858 --> 00:27:00,234
Subtle as possible.

435
00:27:00,318 --> 00:27:01,444
You understand, right?

436
00:27:01,527 --> 00:27:02,570
- Yes.
- Yes, sir.

437
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:05,156
Let's leak the video right now.
We don't have time.

438
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:10,662
The timing will have to be perfect
to deal the final blow.

439
00:27:21,631 --> 00:27:23,007
What is this?

440
00:27:26,427 --> 00:27:28,680
I guess you're finally coming
to your senses.

441
00:27:30,014 --> 00:27:32,475
Cheonggukjang, my favorite,

442
00:27:32,976 --> 00:27:35,687
yellow corvina, and sow thistles.

443
00:27:36,729 --> 00:27:39,482
You said you hated making this
because of the smell.

444
00:27:41,776 --> 00:27:43,319
I love this scent.

445
00:27:44,195 --> 00:27:48,032
It's been so long
since I've eaten with you.

446
00:27:48,116 --> 00:27:51,119
I knew you'd bend a little my way
when you grew old.

447
00:27:51,619 --> 00:27:53,329
How foolish are humans.

448
00:27:54,247 --> 00:27:58,626
You learn who you're dealing with
once you've been broken.

449
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:03,840
If you had listened to me,
we wouldn't have ended up like this.

450
00:28:05,466 --> 00:28:09,012
Control your temper when you're inside,
as an elder among those men.

451
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:11,639
Mr. Jang Kummo!

452
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:14,976
You're under arrest as the mastermind
of President Ko Taesun's assassination.

453
00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:16,519
You have the right to remain--

454
00:28:16,602 --> 00:28:18,229
Hold on, what did you just say?

455
00:28:19,814 --> 00:28:21,691
Chairman Jang, please come with us.

456
00:28:25,069 --> 00:28:26,362
Did you know about this?

457
00:28:26,446 --> 00:28:28,781
Please let my husband finish his meal.

458
00:28:28,865 --> 00:28:30,575
Who knows when he'll return?

459
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,493
Apologies, Ms. Min.

460
00:28:32,577 --> 00:28:34,120
Come on, men. Bring him out.

461
00:28:34,203 --> 00:28:37,123
Younghwee, you can't do this to me.

462
00:28:37,206 --> 00:28:38,666
You're going to regret this.

463
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,585
You're definitely going to regret this!

464
00:28:40,668 --> 00:28:41,919
Min Younghwee!

465
00:28:45,798 --> 00:28:48,217
The smell is making me nauseated.
Throw it all out.

466
00:28:55,391 --> 00:28:56,434
What is it, Taera?

467
00:28:56,517 --> 00:28:58,186
I've picked something out for you.

468
00:28:58,269 --> 00:29:00,355
This suit will be perfect for today.

469
00:29:01,397 --> 00:29:02,482
For today?

470
00:29:02,565 --> 00:29:05,234
Dojin went to the prosecution today.

471
00:29:06,361 --> 00:29:09,030
He said he'll reveal the truth
on your behalf.

472
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:12,659
Dojin is mustering up all of his courage.

473
00:29:12,742 --> 00:29:16,120
You've waited for 15 years.
Are you going to sit back and watch?

474
00:29:17,246 --> 00:29:18,414
Taera.

475
00:29:18,498 --> 00:29:20,583
Report the case yourself, Haesoo.

476
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:24,837
Tell them who was behind
your father's assassination.

477
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:30,093
I'm sure that's what
your late father would want.

478
00:29:31,177 --> 00:29:33,638
- But--
- Neither Dojin nor I

479
00:29:34,514 --> 00:29:36,474
want to live a life of regret anymore.

480
00:29:40,895 --> 00:29:42,730
I'm sorry it took so long, Haesoo.

481
00:30:15,388 --> 00:30:18,016
Taera, this is a pleasant surprise.

482
00:30:18,933 --> 00:30:22,895
I felt bad I didn't even send you flowers
when you became the CEO.

483
00:30:23,438 --> 00:30:24,772
They're beautiful.

484
00:30:25,565 --> 00:30:26,566
And this.

485
00:30:29,485 --> 00:30:33,865
Your support means so much to Jaehyun.
I hope you continue to support him.

486
00:30:35,825 --> 00:30:39,370
Taera, you are such a generous person.

487
00:30:40,204 --> 00:30:41,623
Keep this between us,

488
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:46,669
but I'm only voting for Jaehyun
because of you.

489
00:30:46,753 --> 00:30:49,464
If it weren't for you,
I wouldn't even consider it.

490
00:30:50,465 --> 00:30:53,134
Wow, this is a really nice watch.

491
00:30:53,217 --> 00:30:55,595
How does it look?

492
00:30:55,678 --> 00:30:57,930
You're so thoughtful.

493
00:31:07,023 --> 00:31:08,358
Hong Taera called.

494
00:31:08,983 --> 00:31:10,693
She said it's an important day for you.

495
00:31:12,737 --> 00:31:15,198
We're all ready to go.
We can go right away.

496
00:31:17,784 --> 00:31:19,285
Haesoo, I'm sorry.

497
00:31:19,369 --> 00:31:22,121
What I did to you is unacceptable.

498
00:31:24,123 --> 00:31:25,416
I'm really sorry.

499
00:31:30,797 --> 00:31:31,839
Let's hurry.

500
00:31:31,923 --> 00:31:33,633
We can't miss out on this story.

501
00:31:37,512 --> 00:31:39,389
<i>Stop accusing me of such nonsense!</i>

502
00:31:39,472 --> 00:31:41,057
Who gave you such a tip?

503
00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:46,229
The anonymous informant
also gave us evidence.

504
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:51,567
You used Jake Company
to purchase blue sapphires.

505
00:31:52,193 --> 00:31:57,699
It's been confirmed that Jake Company
is a shell company that you own.

506
00:31:57,782 --> 00:31:59,867
Surname: JANG
Given Names: JAKE

507
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:05,456
You know Director Kim Seondeok
from Hanwool Mental Hospital, right?

508
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:08,751
We found evidence
she ran a killers-for-hire business.

509
00:32:08,835 --> 00:32:12,463
And there was a record of order receipt
to kill President Ko.

510
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:15,717
We also confirmed that, in payment,

511
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,845
she received blue sapphires
with the same serial number as yours.

512
00:32:26,269 --> 00:32:27,687
Let me have my phone call.

513
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:33,401
<i>The ship we're in is about to sink.</i>

514
00:32:33,943 --> 00:32:36,070
You need to come
and save me from drowning.

515
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:40,283
Arrest without a warrant? That's tough
on a man in his elderly years, isn't it?

516
00:32:40,366 --> 00:32:41,576
That's how it is?

517
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:45,371
If I tell them what I know,
you'll drown with me.

518
00:32:45,455 --> 00:32:47,790
<i>No. 50, who assassinated</i>
<i>President Ko Taesun,</i>

519
00:32:47,874 --> 00:32:49,917
<i>is Pyo Jaehyun's wife, Hong Taera.</i>

520
00:32:53,796 --> 00:32:54,797
How unfortunate.

521
00:32:55,673 --> 00:32:56,924
This is in my hands now.

522
00:32:58,593 --> 00:33:00,261
<i>You can drown alone.</i>

523
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:02,221
And don't call me about this ever again.

524
00:33:03,014 --> 00:33:06,434
I don't want people to assume
there's something going on between us.

525
00:33:23,952 --> 00:33:26,496
Looks like you're not getting
the help you want, huh?

526
00:33:31,793 --> 00:33:34,128
Tell my lawyers to come in.

527
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:37,006
You should take responsibility
for arresting an innocent man.

528
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:41,427
I've never bought or even seen
this overpriced necklace.

529
00:33:41,511 --> 00:33:43,930
We have more cards against you
than you think.

530
00:33:47,308 --> 00:33:48,810
This is your wife, right?

531
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:52,772
<i>Yes, that's my necklace.</i>

532
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:56,734
My husband gave it to me
for our 20th anniversary.

533
00:33:58,361 --> 00:34:00,363
I really adored it.

534
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,242
It was stolen years ago.

535
00:34:05,868 --> 00:34:10,039
I wanted to catch the thief,
but my husband stopped me from doing so.

536
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:14,794
It was payment for murder?

537
00:34:16,921 --> 00:34:18,756
I never imagined that he'd stopped me

538
00:34:20,133 --> 00:34:21,592
for such a heinous reason.

539
00:34:23,761 --> 00:34:25,221
Min Younghwee said that?

540
00:34:25,305 --> 00:34:26,848
Bring her over here.

541
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:29,600
Tell her to look me in the eye
and say it to my face.

542
00:34:31,394 --> 00:34:32,395
Please come in.

543
00:34:39,527 --> 00:34:43,489
Why are you here so late?
Your father is being harassed here.

544
00:34:44,073 --> 00:34:46,909
Why the hell am I paying those
piece-of-shit lawyers?

545
00:34:49,078 --> 00:34:50,580
Just admit it, Father.

546
00:34:54,417 --> 00:34:55,543
What did you just say?

547
00:34:55,627 --> 00:34:59,088
Just admit to the crimes you've committed.

548
00:35:02,342 --> 00:35:05,053
How dare you treat
your own father like a criminal?

549
00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:10,224
And you still call yourself my son, huh?

550
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:17,815
<i>If I hadn't stopped Ko Taesun at the time,</i>

551
00:35:18,816 --> 00:35:21,069
<i>you and I wouldn't even be here right now.</i>

552
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:25,073
<i>Should I have left alone the man</i>
<i>who would've torn down Kumjo?</i>

553
00:35:29,994 --> 00:35:32,705
I'll accept the punishment
for hiding my father's crime.

554
00:35:36,084 --> 00:35:37,794
I ask for your thorough investigation.

555
00:35:56,729 --> 00:35:59,315
- What are you doing?
- Let me ask you something.

556
00:35:59,983 --> 00:36:01,359
Isn't this truck from here?

557
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:03,069
Huh? That's my truck!

558
00:36:03,945 --> 00:36:04,988
Did you steal it?

559
00:36:05,071 --> 00:36:06,990
Was it stolen? From here?

560
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:11,911
I came out after delivering flowers,
and it suddenly disappeared.

561
00:36:11,995 --> 00:36:13,621
Where was it?

562
00:36:13,705 --> 00:36:16,207
A temple. It was at Mokeum Temple.

563
00:36:17,125 --> 00:36:18,209
Mokeum Temple?

564
00:36:21,337 --> 00:36:22,422
Hagyeong…

565
00:36:35,101 --> 00:36:38,271
Hang in there, Hajun.

566
00:36:42,275 --> 00:36:43,609
<i>What did you find out?</i>

567
00:36:43,693 --> 00:36:46,029
<i>The accountants have no idea.</i>

568
00:36:46,696 --> 00:36:50,116
Chairman Pyo's stocks
was always managed by someone else.

569
00:36:51,117 --> 00:36:52,702
- Are you stupid?
- Pardon?

570
00:36:52,785 --> 00:36:54,329
Find out who that is.

571
00:36:55,496 --> 00:36:56,497
You may go.

572
00:37:01,336 --> 00:37:05,173
Who would that cautious man
trust with his money?

573
00:37:08,092 --> 00:37:09,552
Could it be?

574
00:37:16,059 --> 00:37:17,060
"Could it be"?

575
00:37:19,437 --> 00:37:20,813
Who is he talking about?

576
00:37:46,798 --> 00:37:49,550
Is it true that you solicited to murder
President Ko Taesun?

577
00:37:49,634 --> 00:37:52,095
Why did you decide to kill
a friend you'd known for 30 years?

578
00:37:52,178 --> 00:37:55,014
Why did you let your second son
Dojin marry Ko Haesoo?

579
00:37:55,098 --> 00:37:56,849
Was it to avoid the investigation?

580
00:38:05,024 --> 00:38:08,486
Do you have anything to say
to your victims and their families?

581
00:38:13,533 --> 00:38:16,786
You hired an assassin to kill
your old friend because of your greed,

582
00:38:16,869 --> 00:38:18,997
and you took his daughter
as your daughter-in-law,

583
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:22,166
and you ran away from the truth
for 15 years, Chairman Jang.

584
00:38:22,917 --> 00:38:24,085
I'll ask you again.

585
00:38:24,168 --> 00:38:28,464
To the victim, Ko Taesun, and his wife,
Gong Jayeong, who killed herself,

586
00:38:29,424 --> 00:38:33,052
and his daughter, who suffered
her whole life searching for the culprit,

587
00:38:34,804 --> 00:38:35,930
do you have anything…

588
00:38:37,682 --> 00:38:38,683
to say to them?

589
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,486
Is this what you wanted?

590
00:38:52,989 --> 00:38:56,576
To put a knife to my throat
in front of the entire nation?

591
00:38:59,412 --> 00:39:04,167
I knew you'd end up stealing
my son and my grandson.

592
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:11,924
You will stop committing crimes
against my wife.

593
00:39:13,176 --> 00:39:15,428
This is the last day
I'm calling you Father.

594
00:39:17,513 --> 00:39:20,683
I stand with the deceased and his family

595
00:39:20,767 --> 00:39:23,102
and will persist in bringing
your sins to light.

596
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:30,360
Let's go.

597
00:39:43,164 --> 00:39:46,292
After today's news,
I will resign as an anchorwoman.

598
00:39:46,376 --> 00:39:50,797
And watch the truth come to light
as a bereaved family member.

599
00:39:52,131 --> 00:39:56,678
I anticipate that this case will provide
hope for those who seek the truth.

600
00:39:58,388 --> 00:40:00,765
Reporting from the arrest scene
of the mastermind

601
00:40:01,641 --> 00:40:04,894
behind President Ko's assassination,
a 15-year cold case.

602
00:40:07,021 --> 00:40:08,064
For YBC News,

603
00:40:09,315 --> 00:40:10,316
this is Ko Haesoo.

604
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:28,251
At last…

605
00:40:30,545 --> 00:40:32,130
this is the end for us, Haesoo.

606
00:40:48,396 --> 00:40:50,690
Are we ready for the press conference?

607
00:40:55,445 --> 00:40:59,240
I, Jang Dojin,
acknowledge all the crimes of my father,

608
00:40:59,324 --> 00:41:01,618
Jang Kummo, the Chairman of Kumjo Group.

609
00:41:02,201 --> 00:41:05,913
I promise that I'll give the investigators
my full cooperation.

610
00:41:05,997 --> 00:41:10,209
I'll take responsibility
and resign as the vice chairman…

611
00:41:11,794 --> 00:41:12,837
effective immediately.

612
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:15,298
Additionally…

613
00:41:15,381 --> 00:41:18,384
…I have another comment
I must make about Hatch.

614
00:41:18,468 --> 00:41:19,302
KUMJO

615
00:41:19,385 --> 00:41:22,847
The research that has been done
over the years at Hatch

616
00:41:24,515 --> 00:41:26,059
was all a hoax.

617
00:41:27,435 --> 00:41:31,356
The death of Red the chimpanzee, who died
after the smart patch presentation,

618
00:41:31,439 --> 00:41:32,857
was caused by Pyo Jaehyun--

619
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,359
Jang Dojin!

620
00:41:39,447 --> 00:41:42,408
You're under arrest for embezzlement
and breach of trust.

621
00:41:43,451 --> 00:41:44,702
- What?
- Arrest him.

622
00:41:45,787 --> 00:41:46,788
Come with us.

623
00:41:59,676 --> 00:42:01,219
Mr. Pyo!

624
00:42:01,844 --> 00:42:04,055
Vice Chairman of Kumjo, Jang Dojin,

625
00:42:04,138 --> 00:42:05,890
was just arrested by the police.

626
00:42:05,974 --> 00:42:06,975
Is that so?

627
00:42:07,809 --> 00:42:09,435
Let's release the video

628
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:12,397
to prove the connection
between Jang Kummo and Mr. Han.

629
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,149
Don't tell me you knew
this was going to happen.

630
00:42:16,234 --> 00:42:18,611
"Heaven helps those who help themselves."

631
00:42:19,278 --> 00:42:20,321
An amazing quote, right?

632
00:42:21,197 --> 00:42:23,491
Make sure we have enough champagne
for tomorrow.

633
00:42:23,574 --> 00:42:25,535
No better way to celebrate.

634
00:42:26,536 --> 00:42:27,537
Yes, sir.

635
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:31,874
You seem to be in a good mood.

636
00:42:31,958 --> 00:42:32,959
Do I?

637
00:42:33,626 --> 00:42:35,336
Did you see the news about Chairman Jang?

638
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:38,047
On top of that, Dojin got arrested.
I was just so shocked.

639
00:42:38,131 --> 00:42:39,424
Do you know anything about it?

640
00:42:41,301 --> 00:42:43,720
You should cut ties with Dojin and Haesoo.

641
00:42:43,803 --> 00:42:46,347
As the first lady, you should
be around people of your caliber.

642
00:42:46,431 --> 00:42:48,391
Their mess will only bring us trouble.

643
00:42:51,019 --> 00:42:52,812
I'm going to shower.

644
00:42:58,484 --> 00:43:01,112
Let's clean out the slush fund
before I get elected.

645
00:43:01,613 --> 00:43:04,532
I'll meet you there to give you
the final documents for the trust.

646
00:43:19,057 --> 00:43:21,434
Why would a temple
need so much electricity?

647
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:28,199
Hello, Haesoo.

648
00:43:28,283 --> 00:43:29,951
<i>Kyojin, Dojin was arrested.</i>

649
00:43:30,493 --> 00:43:31,494
What?

650
00:43:31,995 --> 00:43:33,037
Okay.

651
00:43:41,629 --> 00:43:43,172
Dojin embezzled company funds?

652
00:43:44,424 --> 00:43:45,592
What's this about?

653
00:43:46,801 --> 00:43:48,553
The document has been tampered with.

654
00:43:49,053 --> 00:43:51,181
The ownership of Chairman Jang's
shell company

655
00:43:51,264 --> 00:43:53,099
has been altered to Jang Dojin.

656
00:43:53,183 --> 00:43:55,977
It hasn't been long
since Dojin returned to Kumjo Group.

657
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:59,022
He couldn't have embezzled 500 billion won
in that span of time.

658
00:44:00,273 --> 00:44:01,482
This is Jaehyun's doing.

659
00:44:02,066 --> 00:44:05,069
He's using Dojin as a scapegoat
to get back at me.

660
00:44:05,904 --> 00:44:08,489
But don't you think the timing
was too perfect?

661
00:44:09,324 --> 00:44:11,993
The moment he was about to uncover
the corruption behind Hatch,

662
00:44:12,076 --> 00:44:13,161
the police barged in.

663
00:44:14,787 --> 00:44:15,788
That's right.

664
00:44:16,289 --> 00:44:18,708
Only we knew about the press
conference today.

665
00:44:22,212 --> 00:44:24,172
How was Jaehyun able to set it up?

666
00:44:31,471 --> 00:44:32,472
Could it be…

667
00:44:46,152 --> 00:44:48,488
You must be relieved
to get rid of Chairman Jang

668
00:44:48,571 --> 00:44:49,739
and Dojin both at once.

669
00:44:50,698 --> 00:44:53,368
You must be excited
to reclaim Kumjo for yourself.

670
00:44:53,451 --> 00:44:55,245
It was bound to happen,

671
00:44:55,328 --> 00:44:57,330
even though it took too long.

672
00:44:57,413 --> 00:44:59,707
How did you keep your greed hidden
this entire time?

673
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:01,543
How fascinating.

674
00:45:03,044 --> 00:45:04,963
Just keep your promise.

675
00:45:05,046 --> 00:45:09,008
That you won't mess with Kumjo
during your term as president.

676
00:45:09,092 --> 00:45:10,927
That you'll protect Kyojin.

677
00:45:11,594 --> 00:45:14,138
That's the only reason
I'm working with you.

678
00:45:15,765 --> 00:45:19,269
It wasn't easy to offer the land
I gave to Buddha as a laboratory.

679
00:45:21,521 --> 00:45:22,939
Of course, I know.

680
00:45:23,022 --> 00:45:26,901
Just trust me.
Money is what makes our ties strong.

681
00:45:30,864 --> 00:45:32,866
Here are the credentials
for the blind trust.

682
00:45:33,616 --> 00:45:37,287
Take good care of Hatch's trust
over the next five years.

683
00:45:40,915 --> 00:45:41,916
And one more thing.

684
00:45:44,502 --> 00:45:46,296
Keep Kyojin under control.

685
00:45:47,797 --> 00:45:51,009
He's being a nuisance
because he won't mind his own business.

686
00:45:54,095 --> 00:45:56,306
You should keep your wife under control.

687
00:45:56,389 --> 00:45:57,849
Don't let your guard down.

688
00:45:58,600 --> 00:45:59,601
What do you mean?

689
00:45:59,684 --> 00:46:02,937
Something about your wife bothers me
while I'm praying.

690
00:46:05,064 --> 00:46:06,900
She's no ordinary woman, is she?

691
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:38,223
Kyojin.

692
00:46:38,306 --> 00:46:40,183
I found Jaehyun's co-conspirator.

693
00:46:44,854 --> 00:46:46,231
Where have you been?

694
00:46:51,569 --> 00:46:54,364
Our family is in quite a mess,
so I went to the temple.

695
00:46:54,447 --> 00:46:55,782
I asked Buddha to look after us.

696
00:46:55,865 --> 00:46:57,784
Please stop!

697
00:47:01,246 --> 00:47:02,455
What's wrong, Kyojin?

698
00:47:04,290 --> 00:47:07,126
You told Jaehyun about
Dojin's press conference, didn't you?

699
00:47:07,669 --> 00:47:09,546
How could you work with him?

700
00:47:09,629 --> 00:47:11,339
Do you not know what kind of man he is?

701
00:47:12,090 --> 00:47:14,342
Do you have to go so far
just to get Kumjo?

702
00:47:14,926 --> 00:47:17,303
I'd shake hands with the devil for you.

703
00:47:17,387 --> 00:47:19,514
I'd also cut my hands off for you.

704
00:47:20,265 --> 00:47:22,350
One day, you'll understand.

705
00:47:22,433 --> 00:47:23,685
I'll wait until you do.

706
00:47:25,812 --> 00:47:27,897
I thought you would've changed
at least a bit.

707
00:47:30,316 --> 00:47:31,442
But I was wrong.

708
00:47:34,654 --> 00:47:37,740
I'm staking my life to bring down Kumjo
from this day forward.

709
00:47:39,784 --> 00:47:41,786
Dojin, Haesoo, and Taera.

710
00:47:42,704 --> 00:47:43,955
I'll protect them all.

711
00:47:45,248 --> 00:47:46,249
Mother.

712
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:49,085
I'm leaving you.

713
00:47:50,128 --> 00:47:51,337
Don't go, Kyojin.

714
00:47:53,673 --> 00:47:56,467
Then I'll have to tell Jaehyun everything.

715
00:48:05,101 --> 00:48:07,770
That Hong Taera didn't lose her memory.

716
00:48:09,772 --> 00:48:10,773
Actually,

717
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:13,443
should I tell the whole world?

718
00:48:14,527 --> 00:48:17,030
Pyo Jaehyun's wife was a former assassin.

719
00:48:17,113 --> 00:48:19,866
Hong Taera was the one who shot Ko Taesun.

720
00:48:21,034 --> 00:48:22,452
The world will be in shock.

721
00:48:23,077 --> 00:48:24,078
Mother.

722
00:48:24,621 --> 00:48:26,664
Do you still not know who I am?

723
00:48:27,707 --> 00:48:30,001
I know everything about you, Son.

724
00:48:30,501 --> 00:48:32,378
I'm watching you at every moment.

725
00:48:34,923 --> 00:48:36,299
So stop this now,

726
00:48:37,759 --> 00:48:41,054
if you really want to protect her.

727
00:48:59,197 --> 00:49:03,660
<i>The 29th election</i>
<i>for the President of Korea has begun.</i>

728
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:04,869
<i>The voters are passionate…</i>

729
00:49:04,953 --> 00:49:06,162
THE 29TH PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION

730
00:49:06,246 --> 00:49:08,206
<i>…as the voter turnout</i>
<i>has been unprecedented,</i>

731
00:49:08,289 --> 00:49:10,583
<i>reaching 50% of the voting population</i>
<i>this morning.</i>

732
00:49:11,125 --> 00:49:14,128
Please comment on what you'll do
for the rest of the election.

733
00:49:14,212 --> 00:49:15,672
I, Han Kyungrok,

734
00:49:15,755 --> 00:49:19,384
dedicated my life and my career
to our country's democracy,

735
00:49:19,467 --> 00:49:22,470
so that this country may be run
by its people.

736
00:49:22,554 --> 00:49:26,683
When I voted, I thought of our citizens
who will make this country strong.

737
00:49:26,766 --> 00:49:31,145
Let's write tomorrow's history
with your vote today.

738
00:49:31,229 --> 00:49:33,022
All right, then.

739
00:49:33,106 --> 00:49:34,607
The president will be--

740
00:49:34,691 --> 00:49:36,067
Pyo Jaehyun!

741
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:37,652
Number seven!

742
00:49:37,735 --> 00:49:38,987
Pyo Jaehyun!

743
00:49:41,573 --> 00:49:43,449
The president will be--

744
00:49:43,533 --> 00:49:44,784
Pyo Jaehyun!

745
00:49:44,868 --> 00:49:46,119
Number seven.

746
00:49:46,202 --> 00:49:48,162
Pyo Jaehyun!

747
00:49:48,246 --> 00:49:49,414
Number seven!

748
00:49:49,497 --> 00:49:51,332
Pyo Jaehyun!

749
00:49:56,462 --> 00:49:58,840
Jang Kyojin was
at Mokeum Temple yesterday.

750
00:50:00,133 --> 00:50:01,217
What?

751
00:50:01,301 --> 00:50:02,969
I thought I was mistaken.

752
00:50:04,721 --> 00:50:06,723
But we confirmed that it was his car.

753
00:50:08,183 --> 00:50:10,435
Jang Kyojin is still being a nuisance.

754
00:50:14,731 --> 00:50:17,066
I think the secret lab is at the temple.

755
00:50:17,901 --> 00:50:20,028
Judging by how much power they use,

756
00:50:21,237 --> 00:50:23,239
I'm pretty sure it's below this temple.

757
00:50:23,323 --> 00:50:24,574
But I can't find the entrance.

758
00:50:25,408 --> 00:50:26,409
What about Sungchan?

759
00:50:27,118 --> 00:50:30,622
I've been listening to the wiretap,
but he hasn't left the office yet.

760
00:50:30,705 --> 00:50:32,790
I think we should bring him out here.

761
00:50:33,374 --> 00:50:34,500
How?

762
00:50:34,584 --> 00:50:36,044
We're going to make him move.

763
00:50:40,173 --> 00:50:41,883
Mom, who are they?

764
00:50:42,425 --> 00:50:44,052
Did the police arrest Dad?

765
00:50:44,886 --> 00:50:46,638
Is he really a bad person?

766
00:50:48,973 --> 00:50:50,058
No.

767
00:50:50,141 --> 00:50:52,519
Leo, your dad is not a bad person.

768
00:50:52,602 --> 00:50:53,937
He's a very brave man.

769
00:50:55,230 --> 00:50:58,149
You know that heroes always
get attacked by villains.

770
00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:00,068
Really?

771
00:51:01,236 --> 00:51:02,237
Of course.

772
00:51:03,196 --> 00:51:05,448
Can you stop crying and stay strong?

773
00:51:06,032 --> 00:51:08,618
I have to go help the hero.

774
00:51:09,911 --> 00:51:11,037
Okay.

775
00:51:23,675 --> 00:51:24,676
Haesoo.

776
00:51:26,010 --> 00:51:28,012
Why do you look so disheartened?

777
00:51:28,096 --> 00:51:29,222
You did nothing wrong.

778
00:51:30,348 --> 00:51:33,017
Jaehyun and your mother
concocted this plan together.

779
00:51:33,101 --> 00:51:34,352
My mother?

780
00:51:36,437 --> 00:51:39,524
She's working together with Jaehyun
so she can kill me?

781
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:44,153
Hang in there, Dojin.
Leo is waiting for you at home.

782
00:51:46,322 --> 00:51:48,116
I'll get you out, no matter what.

783
00:51:48,992 --> 00:51:50,368
Oh, what about the election?

784
00:51:50,994 --> 00:51:52,495
How did the election go?

785
00:51:52,579 --> 00:51:54,747
NATIONAL EXIT POLLS,
1ST, HAN - 2ND, PYO - 3RD, JI

786
00:51:54,831 --> 00:51:56,332
Yes!

787
00:52:03,798 --> 00:52:08,136
Congratulations, President Han Kyungrok!

788
00:52:08,219 --> 00:52:10,555
Congratulations!

789
00:52:15,476 --> 00:52:16,477
Mom.

790
00:52:17,228 --> 00:52:20,231
I think I'm going to be president.

791
00:52:20,315 --> 00:52:21,649
Mom!

792
00:52:22,650 --> 00:52:25,028
Mom!

793
00:52:31,743 --> 00:52:33,703
We can still turn things around.

794
00:52:33,786 --> 00:52:36,456
We haven't finished
counting the early votes.

795
00:52:36,539 --> 00:52:38,875
The exit polls mean nothing.

796
00:52:38,958 --> 00:52:41,544
NATIONAL EXIT POLLS,

00:52:57,352 --> 00:52:59,020

00:52:59,103 --> 00:53:01,022
<i>Okay, I'm on my way to the lab.</i>

802
00:53:10,281 --> 00:53:12,492
Hurry up and move it! Hurry!

803
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:13,535
Hurry!

804
00:53:14,077 --> 00:53:15,745
Come on. Hurry!

805
00:53:19,165 --> 00:53:20,416
- Shit.
- You want this?

806
00:53:24,796 --> 00:53:25,797
Come on, get up.

807
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:27,924
Everyone out!

808
00:53:28,007 --> 00:53:30,677
Okay, the power has been cut off.

809
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:31,761
Next is…

810
00:54:09,257 --> 00:54:10,884
Oh, my.

811
00:54:18,349 --> 00:54:19,475
Hey.

812
00:54:19,559 --> 00:54:21,561
Kyojin just went in.

813
00:54:22,061 --> 00:54:24,981
He's in the lab. What do we do now?

814
00:54:25,064 --> 00:54:26,524
Yes.

815
00:54:30,695 --> 00:54:32,113
Hey, wait.

816
00:54:33,823 --> 00:54:34,949
So you're saying

817
00:54:35,533 --> 00:54:37,744
you're going to blow this place up?

818
00:54:40,872 --> 00:54:42,665
<i>Do you think this is some kind of game?</i>

819
00:54:48,463 --> 00:54:50,715
<i>I had a detonator hidden for emergencies.</i>

820
00:54:50,798 --> 00:54:52,467
And we're finally using it today.

821
00:54:53,426 --> 00:54:56,012
After the election,
I was going to move the lab,

822
00:54:56,095 --> 00:54:57,096
so it works out.

823
00:54:57,889 --> 00:54:59,265
What about the subjects here?

824
00:55:01,351 --> 00:55:02,560
They'll disappear.

825
00:55:04,103 --> 00:55:06,397
Along with Jang Kyojin.

826
00:55:07,732 --> 00:55:08,816
Forever.

827
00:55:13,404 --> 00:55:14,531
No.

828
00:55:17,283 --> 00:55:19,536
You have to become president.

829
00:55:39,430 --> 00:55:41,224
Please pick up, Kyojin.

830
00:55:44,102 --> 00:55:46,020
Mun Hajun!

831
00:55:46,104 --> 00:55:47,647
Mun Hajun!

832
00:55:49,899 --> 00:55:51,109
Sujeong!

833
00:55:52,151 --> 00:55:53,361
Kyojin.

834
00:55:53,444 --> 00:55:54,821
How did you get in here?

835
00:55:54,904 --> 00:55:56,823
- Let's get out of here.
- Wait.

836
00:55:58,491 --> 00:55:59,576
I need to get something.

837
00:56:04,205 --> 00:56:05,206
PRIORITY FILES

838
00:56:08,251 --> 00:56:10,044
Where are all the staffers?

839
00:56:15,258 --> 00:56:17,427
Taera, I found your brother.
I'll put him on.

840
00:56:20,054 --> 00:56:22,557
Hagyeong. It's me. Are you okay?

841
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:24,893
Hajun, get out of there now.

842
00:56:24,976 --> 00:56:27,437
- Explosives are about to go off.
- What?

843
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:28,563
Explosives?

844
00:56:40,491 --> 00:56:42,243
All the doors are locked.

845
00:56:42,994 --> 00:56:44,204
They're not getting out.

846
00:56:48,708 --> 00:56:49,876
Kyojin.

847
00:56:50,793 --> 00:56:54,005
Let's not see each other ever again.

848
00:57:36,005 --> 00:57:38,550
ALWAYS ONE TEAM WITH THE PEOPLE
NO. 7, PYO JAEHYUN

849
00:58:12,792 --> 00:58:16,379
Congratulations, President Pyo Jaehyun!

850
00:58:17,088 --> 00:58:21,676
Pyo Jaehyun! Pyo Jaehyun!
Pyo Jaehyun! Pyo Jaehyun!

851
00:58:23,595 --> 00:58:26,723
THE 29TH PRESIDENT
INDEPENDENT PYO JAEHYUN WINS

852
00:58:26,806 --> 00:58:33,521
Pyo Jaehyun! Pyo Jaehyun!
Pyo Jaehyun! Pyo Jaehyun!

853
00:58:57,083 --> 00:58:59,910
PANDORA: BENEATH THE PARADISE

854
00:59:18,149 --> 00:59:22,445
<i>Hajun, watch and see</i>
<i>how I destroy Jaehyun.</i>

855
00:59:22,529 --> 00:59:27,408
There are speculations that Kumjo Group
was involved with this secret lab.

856
00:59:27,492 --> 00:59:29,702
How can a man be so cruel?

857
00:59:29,786 --> 00:59:34,374
You should've stopped your sons from being
nuisances. Why would you piss him off?

858
00:59:35,124 --> 00:59:39,629
<i>Laugh all you want.</i>
<i>I'll lead you to the most agonizing hell.</i>

859
00:59:39,712 --> 00:59:41,172
<i>You know what I did to get here?</i>

860
00:59:41,256 --> 00:59:42,257
<i>Congratulations.</i>

861
00:59:42,882 --> 00:59:46,052
<i>You just destroyed</i>
<i>the Hong Taera that you created.</i>

862
