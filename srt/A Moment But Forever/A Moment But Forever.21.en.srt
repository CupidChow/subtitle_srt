[A Moment But Forever]

2
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:47,210
[Episode 21]

3
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:48,350
No.

4
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,200
He wants to go to Su River.

5
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,710
Su River?

6
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:54,070
That place is remote.

7
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,039
It's far away and sparsely populated.

8
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,400
Why would he want to go there?

9
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:58,509
Yes.

10
00:01:58,789 --> 00:02:00,120
I just want to go to Su River

11
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,150
and get Ling Yao out.

12
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:01,950
No way.

13
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,760
I want to go to Su River to pick Ling Yao up, too.

14
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,680
Is Ling Yao a woman?

15
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,310
She's a beautiful woman.

16
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,240
Stop arguing, all of you.

17
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,520
I'll accompany them to Yandu.

18
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:19,870
Let's draw lots.

19
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,310
One draw to decide.

20
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:23,470
Yuanzhong.

21
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,840
Lu Chen has already agreed

22
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,560
to go with you.

23
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,870
Why draw lots?

24
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,000
That's right. Lu Chen has already...

25
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,120
Enough talk. The one who draws the smallest number, come with me.

26
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,560
Looks like I'm going to Su River.

27
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,470
Zi Fei's got the smallest number.

28
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,080
I heard Yandu has nice scenery.

29
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,590
I've heard about it.

30
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,080
It's a pity that no matter how beautiful the scenery is,

31
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,310
we won't be able to enjoy it for long.

32
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,240
After we find Xiu and Ling Yao,

33
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,320
the five weapon spirits will be gathered,

34
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,400
and then, you'll be able to borrow

35
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,000
the power of the Divine Left Hand

36
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,750
to summon Heavenly Fire to descend upon the world

37
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,190
and destroy all sins in the world.

38
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:33,870
Is this why

39
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,150
you didn't read the letter

40
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,240
Pei Jiu left you?

41
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,000
I gave up Yunniang

42
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,360
because I'm still clear-headed.

43
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,560
What about you?

44
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,640
Are you still clear-headed?

45
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,270
Shouldn't we share some with Zi Fei?

46
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,560
Since he can't go see Ling Yao,

47
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,720
he's in a bad mood.

48
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,870
Don't worry about him.

49
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:42,830
What kind of woman

50
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,000
is Ling Yao exactly,

51
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,000
that Zi Fei is so obsessed with her?

52
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,600
Ling Yao is of the water element,

53
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,920
graceful and elegant,

54
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,120
gentle and charming.

55
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,190
Among all my weapon spirits,

56
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:53,240
she's the most obedient.

57
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,070
Then I believe this trip with Kai Shan and Lu Chen

58
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,480
will go very smoothly.

59
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,600
They'll indeed have a smooth journey,

60
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:02,160
but it might not be the same for us.

61
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,130
Why is that?

62
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,830
My last weapon spirit

63
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:06,720
is called Xiu.

64
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,870
It's of the fire element.

65
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,480
Its temper is a bit peculiar.

66
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:10,950
It's easy to find it,

67
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,040
but subduing it

68
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,750
will be quite difficult.

69
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,000
Is it also a woman?

70
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,680
You'll know when you meet it.

71
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,650
Tanghua, you're awake.

72
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,720
Someone, come quickly!

73
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,630
Come here and look after him.

74
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,800
Yes.

75
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:14,680
Excuse me.

76
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,360
Water.

77
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:18,950
Okay.

78
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,270
Thank you.

79
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,560
Where is this place?

80
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,750
In response to your question, Sir,

81
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,800
this is the City Lord's Mansion in Yandu City.

82
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,270
You're in our young mistress's boudoir.

83
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,070
You got injured,

84
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,800
and our young mistress brought you back.

85
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,950
It's been a few days.

86
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:53,630
Bou-

87
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:55,680
Boudoir?

88
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,040
Yes.

89
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,480
Young... Young Mistress.

90
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,000
Young Mistress, please slow down.

91
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,000
These old bones of mine

92
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
-can't keep up with you. 
-Hurry up.

93
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,870
Young Mistress. Young Mistress.

94
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:14,630
Come, this way please.

95
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:15,750
Slowly, slowly.

96
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:16,570
Young Mistress.

97
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,800
You mustn't sit.

98
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,920
You mustn't.

99
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,360
Come on.

100
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,240
Come on.

101
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:24,940
Lie down.

102
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,780
Doctor, how is he?

103
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,270
His pulse is sluggish and rough,

104
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,190
weak and insufficient,

105
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,430
indicating a condition of exhaustion.

106
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:45,130
He has chest tightness and shortness of breath,

107
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,920
which is due to the body's defense energy fighting against pathogens,

108
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,560
caused by insufficient yang energy.

109
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,070
Additionally, his muscles and bones

110
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,630
were severely injured the other day,

111
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,630
and his spleen was also damaged.

112
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,510
It's truly a fundamental injury.

113
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,630
You said the same thing last time.

114
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,190
Is he getting better or not?

115
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,430
Don't be anxious, Young Mistress.

116
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,190
With injuries like these,

117
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,950
if he were one of us humans,

118
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:14,000
he would have died long ago.

119
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:18,720
But Sir here is an immortal of the Youhu Clan.

120
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,270
He only needs to rest for half a month...

121
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,200
I mean, three to five months...

122
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,540
No, a year or so.

123
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:27,410
He can fully recover in a year or so.

124
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,750
Dr. Zhang.

125
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,440
You're a renowned physician, aren't you?

126
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,750
How can your diagnosis be so vague?

127
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,240
How long will it actually take?

128
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,909
I...

129
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,720
This is also my first time

130
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,150
taking the pulse of a Youhu immortal.

131
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,000
In this old man's opinion,

132
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,480
he should have died long ago.

133
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,320
But, but...

134
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,390
He's still alive now, isn't he?

135
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:52,550
If you ask me how many days it will take

136
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:53,840
for him to fully recover,

137
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,990
I really have no idea.

138
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,300
Young Mistress. Sir.

139
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,870
This old man takes his leave.

140
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,200
Thanks a lot.

141
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,000
I should be the one thanking you.

142
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,750
You got injured while saving me.

143
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,630
Dai.

144
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:30,750
Mr. Tanghua.

145
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,440
This is my younger brother, Zhi Yue.

146
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:36,990
Sir, there's no need for formalities.

147
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,580
Young City Lord Zhi Yue.

148
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,790
Thank you for your rescue.

149
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,200
I, Tanghua, am deeply grateful.

150
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,120
Sir, you're too kind.

151
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,200
Our two races have always been on good terms.

152
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,550
Besides, you're Dai's friend,

153
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,080
which makes you a friend of our Yandu.

154
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,790
Friends helping each other

155
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:54,870
is only natural.

156
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,750
Sir, you needn't worry.

157
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,630
Just focus on recovering here

158
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,600
and make sure to heal properly.

159
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:04,320
Thank you.

160
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,290
Then I won't disturb your rest, Sir.

161
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:08,310
If there's anything you need,

162
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:09,550
please don't hesitate to ask.

163
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,320
I'll take my leave now.

164
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:31,840
What's wrong?

165
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,910
Nothing. I'm just curious.

166
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,510
I often hear Father talk about

167
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:39,960
how you were away from home for years because of

168
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,960
this person, Dai.

169
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,580
Now I've finally met him.

170
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:45,270
He's indeed outstanding.

171
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,870
You have good taste, Dai.

172
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,360
It's all in the past now.

173
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,480
It's all in the past?

174
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:54,870
Well, never mind.

175
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,120
When will Father come out of seclusion?

176
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,150
I'm not sure about that either.

177
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,030
The immortal medicine you brought back this time

178
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,030
is extraordinary, Dai.

179
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,670
It might still take some time

180
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,670
to absorb its properties.

181
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,120
But when the ending draws near,

182
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,200
we'll be notified.

183
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:09,070
Dai, you need to rest more.

184
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,870
You've visibly lost weight these past few days.

185
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,030
You too.

186
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,480
Well then, Dai, I'll head back now.

187
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,440
No need to see me out.

188
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:23,730
[Ningrui Pavilion]

189
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,640
It's all in the past.

190
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,080
Chief.

191
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,430
We've been on the road for too long.

192
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,200
Everyone is almost at their limit.

193
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,360
How about we find a place

194
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,150
to rest and recuperate?

195
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,510
There's a water source 10 miles to the east.

196
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,840
Let's go rest there.

197
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:43,960
Yes.

198
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,150
Why are you staring at me?

199
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,240
Since you found out

200
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,630
I'm the Mute Lady of Wu Mountain,

201
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,080
you've always wanted to drive me away.

202
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,900
Why don't you want to drive me away now?

203
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:15,170
You saved me again in my sea of consciousness.

204
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,480
How could I have the heart to drive you away now?

205
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,870
But I'd saved you before that, too.

206
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:22,720
Then leave.

207
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,150
I'm driving you away.

208
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,960
I want to ask you a question.

209
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,910
Earlier, in your sea of consciousness,

210
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:40,960
I saw myself.

211
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,200
You pictured me as

212
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,510
a witch,

213
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,530
foolishly guarding the door for you.

214
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,240
That demon said

215
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,390
this means you both guard against me

216
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,600
and trust me.

217
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,720
So, do you really guard against me

218
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,960
or trust me?

219
00:13:58,910 --> 00:13:59,720
Also,

220
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:01,480
your dreams

221
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,870
get scarier with each layer.

222
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:06,750
So what's in your ninth layer

223
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,600
of dreams?

224
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:08,670
Ji Tanyin.

225
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,320
Why does the War Demon

226
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,630
have your birth date and time

227
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,200
and is able to possess you?

228
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,710
I... I don't know either.

229
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,000
Then are you willing to let me enter

230
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,150
your sea of consciousness?

231
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,510
In other words,

232
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,030
are you willing to let me know

233
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,510
the secrets in your heart?

234
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,430
Since you're not willing yourself,

235
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,080
what right do you have

236
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,600
to know everything about me?

237
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:39,270
Let me give you a piece of advice.

238
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,910
Don't try to know

239
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,440
everything about anyone.

240
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,310
You'll be disappointed.

241
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:32,690
Chief.

242
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,770
I have a question to ask.

243
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,550
I don't understand.

244
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,480
I saw it clearly at that time,

245
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:45,960
Chief, that you clearly had the chance

246
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,840
to plunge the dagger into his heart,

247
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,150
but you held back.

248
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,600
Because I saw his eyes.

249
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,560
Those were the eyes of a demon.

250
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,490
The eyes of a demon?

251
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:01,750
How is that possible?

252
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,120
It's impossible indeed.

253
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,480
He is the High Priest of the Youhu Clan,

254
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:07,270
and he possesses the Divine Left Hand.

255
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,510
Why would he have the eyes of a demon?

256
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,790
Where are you going?

257
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:34,840
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

258
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,670
Come with me.

259
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,670
Let go of me!

260
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,240
My mother is still in Gushan.

261
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,630
I need to go back and find her.

262
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:40,840
You won't find her.

263
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,550
I can!

264
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:43,550
Can't you just listen to me?

265
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:44,730
I won't!

266
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,410
You-

267
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,270
Chief.

268
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,400
How old is your mother?

269
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,339
Don't you know?

270
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:09,000
She must not be young anymore.

271
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,710
Ming Zhang was right.

272
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,200
You won't find her.

273
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,270
Why?

274
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,569
She's already dead.

275
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:15,560
That's impossible!

276
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,910
Our clan has the blood of the divine race.

277
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:20,109
We have long lifespans.

278
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,440
How could she have died?

279
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,200
According to our clan's rules,

280
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,109
men protect the clan and kill enemies

281
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:26,240
until their last breath,

282
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,849
while women bear offspring

283
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,160
also until their last breath.

284
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,510
Our clan's constitution is different from that of the human race.

285
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,400
Childbirth damages the mother's body

286
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,680
and drains a lot of vital energy.

287
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,640
That's why in our War Demon Clan,

288
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,030
no woman can live long.

289
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:37,830
Nonsense!

290
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,030
That's not true.

291
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,790
Don't you know in your heart

292
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,640
whether what I said is true or not?

293
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,960
You grew up in the War Demon Clan.

294
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,920
How many elderly women have you seen?

295
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,750
After the Battle of Pinghu,

296
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:53,160
only about one out of 100 of our War Demon Clan survived.

297
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,750
In extraordinary times,

298
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,240
extraordinary measures must be taken.

299
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,830
If not for this,

300
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,790
how could our clan have survived until now?

301
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:01,270
How could we have accumulated enough strength

302
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:02,480
to fight against our enemies?

303
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,830
Why?

304
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:07,640
The human race was once enslaved too,

305
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,160
and they also once became a vassal of another clan.

306
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,720
Why didn't they do this?

307
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,160
That's because they are weak.

308
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:14,790
They are used to bowing and scraping,

309
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:16,750
living by begging for mercy.

310
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:18,960
They are unwilling to make changes

311
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,350
and unwilling to make sacrifices.

312
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:21,660
Therefore,

313
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,920
they are destined to always be the weak ones!

314
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,880
You speak so grandly,

315
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:28,440
but you're a woman too.

316
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,440
Why don't you go die?

317
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,250
I will.

318
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:34,480
As long as I can create the perfect War Demon,

319
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:35,680
revive our clan,

320
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,310
and kill the High Priest of the Youhu Clan,

321
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,000
I'm ready to die at any moment.

322
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,350
I'll send you on your way right now!

323
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,510
Stop!

324
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,440
Ming Zhang!

325
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,190
You cost me a great warrior.

326
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:19,160
Chief...

327
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,890
Chief, I beg you.

328
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,790
Please spare his life.

329
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,300
He just wants to reunite with his mother.

330
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:29,510
There's nothing wrong with that.

331
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,010
The one who deserves to die

332
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,700
the High Priest of the Youhu Clan,

333
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:35,200
not him.

334
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,170
Chief.

335
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,480
I've shattered your source of power

336
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,480
and destroyed all your skills.

337
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:05,920
From now on,

338
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,030
you are no longer a member of the War Demon Clan.

339
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,110
Ming Zhang.

340
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,000
Ming Zhang.

341
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,750
Ming... Ming Zhang!

342
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:57,880
Ming Zhang!

343
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,750
Ming Zhang!

344
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,110
How are you?

345
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:03,790
I know.

346
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:05,110
I... I'll find someone to save you.

347
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,240
I know someone who can save you.

348
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,750
I... I'll go find someone to save you.

349
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,440
No need.

350
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:12,310
What?

351
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,440
I...

352
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:17,490
Am finally...

353
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,130
Relieved...

354
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:27,480
No, no. You...

355
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,920
Ming Zhang! Ming Zhang!

356
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,550
Why did you help me?

357
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,960
Why?

358
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:38,400
You've been helping me since the first time we met.

359
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,750
Why?

360
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,790
Because...

361
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,070
Because I am also...

362
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:48,270
Mother's son.

363
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,200
I am Mother's...

364
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,510
First son.

365
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:06,920
Lin.

366
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:09,070
Look, what's this?

367
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,590
Mother, how come there's still food?

368
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,920
Eat slowly, okay?

369
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:20,830
You...

370
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,720
You're better than me.

371
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:28,030
You must live well.

372
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,200
As for me...

373
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I'll go find Mother first.

374
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:39,310
Ming... Ming Zhang!

375
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,510
Ming Zhang! Ming Zhang! Ming Zhang!

376
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:42,310
Brother!

377
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:43,640
Brother!

378
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:47,350
Brother!

379
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:10,200
[Yandu City]

380
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,720
What's wrong?

381
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:23,960
Nothing.

382
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:25,310
Has Zi Fei arrived yet?

383
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:28,350
No.

384
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,750
Didn't you say he set off first?

385
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,720
Yuanzhong, I've figured it out.

386
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:43,720
During the drawing of lots earlier today,

387
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,000
you must have cheated with magic.

388
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,750
It doesn't count.

389
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,510
I'm setting off to find Ling Yao now.

390
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,550
Since it's a long journey,

391
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:49,590
I'm taking the horse.

392
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:50,880
Thank you. Don't worry about me.

393
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:51,960
From Zi Fei.

394
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,070
Yandu City is quite prosperous.

395
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:08,220
It hasn't changed much though.

396
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:11,830
You seem to know Yandu well.

397
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,640
I've been here once.

398
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,550
When?

399
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,850
A long time ago.

400
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:22,570
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

401
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,290
I didn't know this place was called Yandu.

402
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,490
I just suddenly remembered.

403
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,310
Let's go in.

404
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,560
Bravo! Bravo!

405
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,720
Tang's live chickens, freshly slaughtered!

406
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,640
Come check it out!

407
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,830
Tang's live chickens, freshly slaughtered!

408
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:19,590
Come again.

409
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:21,240
Miss.

410
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,840
Check out our newly arrived hairpins.

411
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,170
Each one is more beautiful than the last.

412
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:25,410
Which one do you like, Miss?

413
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,510
I'll show you.

414
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,030
Miss, how about this one?

415
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,200
This is the best-selling hairpin

416
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,680
at my little stall.

417
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,430
Its shape

418
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,720
resembles two intertwined branches,

419
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,550
entwined together.

420
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:36,030
It symbolizes a lifelong commitment,

421
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:37,480
sharing both joys and sorrows.

422
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,000
Do you like it?

423
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:40,790
Miss.

424
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:42,510
This intertwined-branch hairpin has a special meaning.

425
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:44,110
It can only be given by a husband to his wife.

426
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:44,680
After all,

427
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,200
the intertwined branches and conjoined lotus

428
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,270
are both tokens of love.

429
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:49,400
It signifies lifelong companionship.

430
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:51,430
We'll take this one.

431
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,510
How much is it?

432
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:54,030
Only 10 taels of silver.

433
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,430
Absolutely a fair price.

434
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,070
Boss, how much is this one?

435
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:59,160
This one? This one is pure jade.

436
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,070
Made of pure jade.

437
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,400
It might be a bit expensive.

438
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,750
Look.

439
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:07,480
Here you go, Boss.

440
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,830
Thank you, Sir. Here you go.

441
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:11,830
Here.

442
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:14,990
Worn by this young lady,

443
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,160
the hairpin looks even more beautiful.

444
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,680
Let's go.

445
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,550
Take care, esteemed customers.

446
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:21,350
Thank you.

447
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,400
Stop! Someone come here!

448
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,240
Those two cultivators

449
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,160
used magic tricks to deceive people!

450
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,240
-Let's go.
-Get them!

451
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:34,310
There are swindlers! Quickly, report to the authorities!

452
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:35,660
[Rest Teahouse]

453
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:34,830
Got it!

454
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:36,160
Stop! Stop!

455
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:37,290
Catch the thieves!

456
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:38,590
Catch the thieves!

457
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:39,880
Catch the thieves!

458
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:42,000
Catch the thieves! Catch the thieves!

459
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:44,790
Catch them! Catch the thieves!

460
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,630
Catch the thieves! Catch the thieves!

461
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:55,290
Catch them! Catch the thieves!

462
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,930
Don't you have a lot of money?

463
00:26:57,610 --> 00:26:58,850
Zi Fei took it all.

464
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,480
This shopkeeper is probably a cultivator.

465
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:03,480
Otherwise, he wouldn't

466
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,680
have seen through my illusion.

467
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:08,000
Make way, make way!

468
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:08,830
Make way!

469
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,220
Who are these two people?

470
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,010
He seems to be that...

471
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:15,790
What did they do?

472
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:17,260
The one who just ran out.

473
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:20,940
[Wanted] [Reward]

474
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,360
The two thieves they were shouting about catching.

475
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:19,780
What times are we living in?

476
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:21,310
The Kunlun Mirror has been updated over a dozen times,

477
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:22,480
and yet there are still cultivators

478
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,270
using alchemy to turn stones into silver for fraud.

479
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:25,920
They must have been cooped up for a long time.

480
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,070
They don't know how the outside world

481
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:28,440
has completely changed.

482
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,400
They must think knowing some magic skills

483
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,790
makes them invincible in this world.

484
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:32,960
A-Aren't they idiots?

485
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:34,160
Indeed.

486
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,680
Let's go.

487
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,240
Let me tell you something.

488
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,200
I think I've figured it out.

489
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,750
They must have used some kind of

490
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,510
crafted device that separates truth from illusion.

491
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:51,030
That's why they easily saw through

492
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:51,880
your magic.

493
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:55,640
So what do we do now?

494
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:57,440
What do you mean?

495
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,720
You don't have any money,

496
00:27:58,830 --> 00:27:59,720
and neither do I.

497
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:01,270
We can't even afford to stay at an inn.

498
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,750
Moreover,

499
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:03,830
this thing

500
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,750
is available even at small street stalls.

501
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,750
So your magic skills

502
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:07,920
are completely useless.

503
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,790
Where's your money?

504
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:15,790
Zi Fei took it.

505
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:24,070
What's this?

506
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:25,400
Liujiao Palace?

507
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:26,750
Back at Baitou Mountain,

508
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:27,790
this was the last assignment

509
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:29,440
my master left for me.

510
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,750
Before Zi Fei returns,

511
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,110
we can stay here.

512
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,160
Stay here?

513
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,440
You've shrunk us.

514
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:53,790
It's the space of this world

515
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:55,160
that I've folded and compressed.

516
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:55,920
All people and objects

517
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,200
that can enter this world

518
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,510
will change accordingly.

519
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,440
How did we get in here?

520
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,270
At the moment we entered,

521
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,110
the space here was expanded.

522
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,830
That's why you didn't feel anything.

523
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,310
This place looks exactly like Liujiao Palace.

524
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,640
I modeled it after Liujiao Palace.

525
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:23,110
There's even wine.

526
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,480
Did you make that too?

527
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,160
I made all the furniture and decorations.

528
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,310
The bedding,

529
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,200
cups, and utensils

530
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,240
were all brought by me

531
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,030
from Baitou Mountain.

532
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,030
Look.

533
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:34,070
I even brought

534
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,070
my master's chessboard here too.

535
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:36,240
We can play chess now.

536
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:40,720
Let's go check out my room.

537
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:51,000
It's truly a masterpiece.

538
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:52,590
This is called Linglong House.

539
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,750
You've heard of it, right?

540
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,440
I've heard of it,

541
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:56,550
but I've never seen one.

542
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,270
Such creation techniques

543
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,830
could rightfully be called a divine skill, I believe.

544
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:04,160
You truly live up to your reputation, Mute Lady of Wu Mountain.

545
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,310
It's alright, I guess.

546
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,270
How are you?

547
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:18,000
Are you hurt anywhere?

548
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,680
Where's the dog?

549
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,310
What?

550
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:20,640
The dog!

551
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:23,070
We need to catch it.

552
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:24,590
The Liujiao Palace is still in its mouth!

553
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:28,640
Madam.

554
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,160
Why hasn't Wangcai

555
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,030
come today?

556
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:32,000
That's weird.

557
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,110
It's already mealtime.

558
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:34,400
Usually, it would have been here by now.

559
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,270
Ji Tanyin!

560
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:41,550
Slow down!

561
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:44,680
Madam, look.

562
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,250
That young lady is running so fast.

563
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,510
Even faster than Wangcai.

564
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:54,640
Good dog.

565
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:56,480
Give it back to me, and I'll forgive you.

566
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,910
Be good. Open your mouth, will you?

567
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:06,880
This is the last refuge

568
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,480
for me and him.

569
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,940
If you don't give it back to us,

570
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:10,960
we

571
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,720
will have to sleep on the streets tonight.

572
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,680
Go.

573
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:36,070
Let's go.

574
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,390
Let's go.

575
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:41,310
Run!

576
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:04,590
What are you doing?

577
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,310
It's covered in dog saliva.

578
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:09,550
I'm washing it.

579
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:20,430
So you knew it would leak all along.

580
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:23,590
Well, the house is open-air after all.

581
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,790
Of course it's going to leak.

582
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:25,640
Then why didn't you stop me

583
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,680
when I was washing it?

584
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,490
Would you have stopped if I had?

585
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,270
Get to work.

586
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,760
You have quite a few things in your portable cosmic bag.

587
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:21,070
Just no money.

588
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:22,960
You're not new to

589
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,110
wandering in this world.

590
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:25,480
Why didn't you bring any money when you went out?

591
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:26,350
It was because

592
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:27,680
I was out with you, okay?

593
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,510
Why would a handmaiden

594
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:30,960
bring money when going out with her master?

595
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,000
You...

596
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:39,510
Do you think we're high enough

597
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,920
that the dogs can't climb up here?

598
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,710
I gave up Yunniang

599
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:19,000
because I'm still clear-minded.

600
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,710
What about you?

601
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,440
Are you clear-minded?

602
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,550
What's wrong?

603
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,280
Let's go find the weapon spirit.

604
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,030
There's no need to rush.

605
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:40,920
Let's go now.

606
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:41,920
If we find it quickly,

607
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,320
we can meet up with Zi Fei and the others.

608
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,550
Then we'll have money.

609
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:49,480
Let's go.

610
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,400
Come on, hurry up.

611
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,030
I told you there's no need to rush.

612
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,150
Why don't we

613
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:55,360
disguise ourselves?

614
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,960
It wouldn't be good if someone recognizes us.

615
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,150
No need.

616
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:01,190
The human race has another characteristic.

617
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,710
They're forgetful.

618
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,110
Is that so?

619
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,550
Let's go.

620
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:32,030
Aren't you going to eat?

621
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:33,480
No.

622
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,630
You're full after just one pancake?

623
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:37,630
No, I'm still hungry.

624
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:38,480
Then why aren't you eating?

625
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:39,630
You don't have any money.

626
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:48,920
This jade pendant should be

627
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,070
worth quite a lot, right?

628
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:51,880
Why didn't you take it out earlier?

629
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:53,510
I forgot.

630
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,670
Are you going to eat or not?

631
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:05,920
What are you eating?

632
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:06,650
Noodles.

633
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:08,470
Of course I know you're eating noodles.

634
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,360
Why are our noodles different?

635
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:12,630
Because the noodles you're eating were made by me.

636
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:17,280
You made a bowl of noodles for me

637
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,150
by yourself?

638
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:22,760
Previously at Orange Lake,

639
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:24,400
when you got possessed,

640
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:25,360
that day

641
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,150
should have been your birthday, right?

642
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,110
What are you doing?

643
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,070
Tasting yours.

644
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,840
What if your noodles taste better than mine?

645
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,190
I...

646
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:41,840
But now that I've tried it,

647
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,480
your cooking does taste better.

648
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:51,320
Where are we going

649
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,320
to look for Xiu later?

650
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:54,880
Xiu likes lively places.

651
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:56,710
Aren't you a regular in Yandu?

652
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,710
You should know

653
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:58,840
where the liveliest places are, right?

654
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:00,360
There are quite a few.

655
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,190
Ji Tanyin.

656
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,760
Happy birthday.

657
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:48,630
Yandu has two districts each in the east, west, and north,

658
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,440
while the south alone occupies three districts.

659
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,760
We are currently in

660
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,110
the fifth ward of the East Central District.

661
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:54,670
The street we are entering

662
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:55,760
is the central axis.

663
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,150
Go straight from here,

664
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,480
and we'll reach the west of the city.

665
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:00,280
That's where the common people live.

666
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,510
Turning right from there

667
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:03,030
leads to the three southern districts,

668
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,880
where craftsmen gather.

669
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,190
There are spinners, masons, carpenters,

670
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,670
iron workers, and so on.

671
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:10,670
It's a mixed crowd and very noisy.

672
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,120
The two northern districts are where the City Lord's Mansion is located.

673
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,590
That area has always been quiet,

674
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:18,510
and parades and markets are prohibited there.

675
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,280
Xiu probably wouldn't like it there.

676
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:21,440
We are currently in

677
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,280
the East Central and East Outer Districts.

678
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,110
This is where trade and commerce are concentrated.

679
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:26,620
There are taverns, teahouses,

680
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:28,220
theaters, entertainment houses;

681
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:29,250
everything you can think of.

682
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,000
It's bustling with activity during the day

683
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:33,000
and equally lively at night.

684
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,320
If I were Xiu,

685
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,440
I'd like it here too.

686
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:40,800
Would you like to try

687
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,230
Yandu's mode of transportation?

688
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,150
What is it?

689
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:49,080
This is a barrel cart.

690
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:54,840
Isn't Yandu known as

691
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,920
the city of craftsmanship?

692
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,590
Why would they allow such wooden barrel carts

693
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:58,750
to travel in the city?

694
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,670
It's fun, don't you think?

695
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,110
Actually, I didn't quite understand it before, either.

696
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,710
Since the human race

697
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:08,190
can already build tower ships,

698
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:08,880
why would they

699
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,070
go back to basics

700
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:12,070
and use barrel carts as a means of transportation?

701
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:13,630
But today, I suddenly realized

702
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:14,590
one of its advantages,

703
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:16,630
and it all made sense.

704
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:19,880
Because it doesn't cost any money.

705
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:23,880
That's indeed a huge advantage.

706
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,550
Moreover, tower ships need

707
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:26,440
the crystals of the Youhu Clan

708
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,400
as their power source.

709
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,840
But barrel carts don't need that.

710
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:29,760
They only need

711
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,670
to navigate Yandu City's terrain

712
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:32,320
to move autonomously

713
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,550
on the roads.

714
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,840
Isn't that the meaning

715
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,000
of the art of craftsmanship?

716
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,480
Those interesting

717
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,630
and imaginative ideas

718
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,510
are actually

719
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:42,190
just icing on the cake.

720
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,800
What do you think?

721
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:46,920
Do you think that

722
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:49,110
one day, due to the development of craftsmen,

723
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,630
barrel carts will be replaced by tower ships?

724
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:53,280
Will there be a day

725
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,280
when they suddenly disappear completely?

726
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:02,230
What does any of this have to do with me?

727
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,670
Won't you

728
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:06,280
suddenly miss it one day?

729
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,880
It's like how we never remember

730
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,360
the delicacies we normally eat,

731
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,110
but you'll definitely remember

732
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:13,550
that bowl of plain noodles we ate

733
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:14,630
when we were wanted in the entire city

734
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:16,230
and penniless.

735
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,360
We can continue

736
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,450
to eat plain noodles tonight.

737
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,360
Tomorrow's three meals

738
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,000
can also all be plain noodles.

739
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,190
You're not telling me that

740
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:34,840
before Zi Fei arrives in Yandu,

741
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:36,070
all we can afford

742
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:37,070
is plain noodles, are you?

743
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,070
That's right.

744
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:46,120
Come on.

745
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:51,360
Here.

746
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,710
Look.

747
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,320
What is this place?

748
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,360
This is where craftsmen rest

749
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,510
and drink tea.

750
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,330
Why is a place for rest and entertainment

751
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,800
so noisy?

752
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:03,800
Usually, when craftsmen

753
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,670
work together,

754
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:05,440
there are always times

755
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,630
when they disagree.

756
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,150
If they argue until their mouths are dry,

757
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:09,480
they'll come here for a cup of tea.

758
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:10,800
But usually, they

759
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,070
continue to argue for a while longer.

760
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:13,840
Didn't you say Xiu

761
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,320
likes lively places?

762
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,630
This place is lively enough, isn't it?

763
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,550
What Xiu likes is liveliness,

764
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:19,880
not noise.

765
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:27,590
During my 60 years of seclusion,

766
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:28,960
the outside world

767
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,550
has undergone tremendous changes

768
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:32,430
due to the human race's craftsmanship.

769
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,880
Yet behind closed doors,

770
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:35,190
they are still passionate about

771
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:36,360
arguing and debating.

772
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:38,360
It seems so.

773
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,440
Humans always like

774
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,150
to distinguish right from wrong,

775
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,880
even though they know

776
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:45,030
that many things

777
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:46,610
don't have clear boundaries.

778
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,590
But they still keep

779
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:49,920
defining these boundaries

780
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,550
and using them to constrain themselves.

781
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,230
Although humans live no more than 100 years,

782
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:56,880
sometimes their vision

783
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:59,000
is more far-reaching

784
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:00,070
than that of the Youhu Clan and the War Demon Clan.

785
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:02,230
I thought you wouldn't like

786
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:03,190
these constraints.

787
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:06,660
Oh, right.

788
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:08,260
I'll take you to another place.

789
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,510
It's lively there too.

790
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:10,190
Maybe Xiu

791
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:11,510
likes to hang out there.

792
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:13,550
Alright, for the next place,

793
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:14,820
I'll lead the way.

794
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:19,400
[Dance House]

795
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:36,400
Is this the place you were talking about?

796
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,230
You two have come at just the right time.

797
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,320
The Immortal Dance

798
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,590
is just about to begin.

799
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:43,880
There are still some good seats available.

800
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,280
Let me show you to your seats.

801
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:49,760
Thank you, esteemed guests.

802
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,480
You two aren't from Yandu, are you?

803
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:54,800
Don't blink in a moment.

804
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:55,960
This Flying Immortal Dance

805
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,450
is one of a kind in Yandu.

806
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,710
A number of scholars and refined guests

807
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:01,280
have come here to witness its splendor.

808
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:02,570
What makes it one of a kind?
