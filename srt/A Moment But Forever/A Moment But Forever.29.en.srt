[A Moment But Forever]

2
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:47,150
[Episode 29]

3
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,229
Are you okay?

4
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:57,280
Yes.

5
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,430
Here you go.

6
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,000
Thank you, uncle.

7
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,870
My father said something big is happening in the city today.

8
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,650
No one is allowed to play on the streets.

9
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,470
You should hurry home then.

10
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,100
You should go home too.

11
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,360
Zhi Dai, we should get going.

12
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,560
Young Mistress Dai, please stop.

13
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,000
Young City Lord.

14
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,710
What's going on?

15
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,000
Dai.

16
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:33,280
Father.

17
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,150
Your daughter has returned.

18
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,810
I left home recklessly at a young age.

19
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,680
I used to think that

20
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,079
the most important thing in life

21
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:58,940
was to pursue

22
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,330
what you like,

23
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,800
to be free and unrestrained,

24
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,080
and to dare to dream and act.

25
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,260
Only then would I not let myself down.

26
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,230
But I was wrong.

27
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,710
Not only did I waste time,

28
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,910
but I also failed

29
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,480
to repay my parents' kindness in raising me.

30
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,220
[In Memory of Beloved Father, the Late Lord of Yandu City, Zhi Gong]

31
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,829
Over these past years,

32
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,630
I've considered myself dead.

33
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,240
I even once hoped

34
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,190
that you would consider me dead as well.

35
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,830
Only in this way

36
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,830
could I have a slightly clear conscience.

37
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:34,970
Until I met Shen Ying again,

38
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,560
I didn't realize that you, Father,

39
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,070
had been thinking of me all along,

40
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,960
and had even been sending people to protect me in secret.

41
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,190
I...

42
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,430
I'm truly ashamed of myself.

43
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,390
Father.

44
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,750
Zhi Yue established the Wushuang Society in private

45
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,130
and colluded with War Demons

46
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:11,480
to intentionally provoke a war

47
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,240
between the human race and the Youhu Clan.

48
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,740
I discovered it in time,

49
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,270
but I failed to inform you

50
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,420
because I hoped he would tell you himself.

51
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,190
Unexpectedly, his ambition was like that of a wolf,

52
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,950
disregarding your father-son relationship entirely,

53
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,430
and he actually committed such a beastly act

54
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,280
of patricide and usurpation.

55
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:28,990
Today,

56
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,480
I must put righteousness before family ties

57
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:33,860
and purge my own family.

58
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:02,990
Gentleman.

59
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:09,000
Are you looking for someone?

60
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,390
No.

61
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,480
I'm waiting for someone.

62
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,000
Waiting? Who are you waiting for?

63
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,270
You.

64
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,550
You're waiting for me?

65
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:41,409
The ones who killed Father are you

66
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,240
and the Youhu Clan,

67
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,270
not me!

68
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:45,810
Will you atone for your crimes by taking your own life,

69
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,680
or do I have to do it myself?

70
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,020
The Youhu Clan is the real culprit!

71
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:52,230
The only reason they were willing to accept you

72
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:54,120
was to use you,

73
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:56,240
to kill Father through you,

74
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:57,690
thereby sowing

75
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,190
discord between us,

76
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,170
making us turn against each other,

77
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,570
and leaving our race leaderless

78
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,800
and in disarray.

79
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,800
They did this

80
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,570
to annex the human race,

81
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,390
Dai!

82
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,920
Let me call you Elder Sister one last time.

83
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,800
If you still care about Father

84
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,990
and the human race in your heart,

85
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,310
wake up a bit.

86
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:24,430
Stop doing stupid things that please your enemies

87
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:27,240
and hurt those who care about you.

88
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,040
Go explain to Father yourself.

89
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:38,190
I've already lost my father.

90
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:41,040
I don't want to lose my elder sister too.

91
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:43,870
Don't push me anymore!

92
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:52,430
Take action!

93
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,950
It looks like

94
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,580
it's quite lively here.

95
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,700
[Qingqi Hall]

96
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,570
Zhi Dai, are you alright?

97
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,720
High Priest Yuanzhong.

98
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,870
You plan to use her

99
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,160
to scheme for my family's assets in Yandu.

100
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,420
Have you asked for the consent

101
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:26,090
of everyone present?

102
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,750
What do you mean by that, Young City Lord?

103
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:30,690
Zhi Dai left home at a young age.

104
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:33,059
The only person I've relied on since childhood was my father.

105
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,270
But for the prosperity

106
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,750
of the human race,

107
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:37,350
Father had worked

108
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,630
tirelessly for decades, worrying day and night.

109
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,200
However, his health

110
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,770
had been deteriorating day by day.

111
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,100
Fortunately, Dai returned home

112
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,840
and brought back a miraculous pill.

113
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,430
After Father took it,

114
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:50,790
he went into seclusion.

115
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,390
However, a few days ago,

116
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,200
he died suddenly.

117
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:57,790
High Priest,

118
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,960
may I ask if that pill

119
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,550
came from your Fangwai Mountain?

120
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,630
I don't know about that.

121
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,270
You don't know?

122
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,720
What about the Elders present?

123
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,000
Don't tell me you don't know either!

124
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:23,670
Several months ago,

125
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,550
someone did sneak into our mountain to steal medicine.

126
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,630
After investigation, we found that the thief

127
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,370
was the eldest daughter of the old City Lord,

128
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,910
that is, Young Mistress Dai here.

129
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,870
Previously, Young Mistress Dai

130
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,600
had humbly served as a maid in our Fangwai Mountain

131
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,860
for over 10 years.

132
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,000
At that time,

133
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,950
we didn't know her identity.

134
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,640
Later, after she stole the miraculous pill,

135
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:42,960
our clan sent someone to investigate.

136
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,870
That's when we learned about her background.

137
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,240
Actually,

138
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:49,030
our clan has always been on good terms with Yandu.

139
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,550
If she had revealed her identity and asked for it directly,

140
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:53,600
our clan wouldn't have been stingy, either.

141
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:55,550
So for our clan,

142
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:57,000
this isn't a big deal.

143
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:59,820
And we have absolutely no intention of holding her accountable.

144
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,440
Her actions were out of filial piety.

145
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,550
Consider that pill as our gift to her.

146
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,790
The Youhu Clan is indeed merciful.

147
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,930
Then I dare to ask another question.

148
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,290
What effects can be expected

149
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,270
after taking this pill?

150
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,240
What?

151
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,440
Do you suspect that

152
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,440
the pill was poison?

153
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:20,600
I wouldn't dare.

154
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:23,630
This pill was forged from

155
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:24,720
the divine blood of our High Priest.

156
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,720
It has the effect of prolonging life.

157
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:27,880
Given your father's constitution,

158
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:28,960
taking this pill

159
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:31,300
should have added at least 30 to 50 years to his life.

160
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,590
30 to 50 years?

161
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,190
What a bold claim, 30 to 50 years.

162
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,670
Then where are my father's 30 to 50 years!

163
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,550
How come after taking the pill,

164
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,840
he suddenly died?

165
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,340
It was you who killed Father.

166
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,050
High Priest.

167
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,620
She said I killed my father.

168
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,200
Do you agree?

169
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,050
Don't you feel guilty?

170
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,390
Tanyin.

171
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,840
I bought some sweet soup.

172
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,270
It's really delicious.

173
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,670
Come on, have a taste.

174
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm a bit worried about Yuanzhong.

175
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:29,150
I want to go to the City Lord's Mansion to check on him.

176
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,390
Drink the soup first.

177
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,790
I'll take you there in a while.

178
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,360
Do you find all this

179
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,360
very amusing, High Priest?

180
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,630
I just have a feeling that this scene

181
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:00,010
is somewhat familiar.

182
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:02,640
High Priest, you possess the demigod power

183
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,950
and have seen all the trials and tribulations of this world.

184
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,150
The life or death of a mere human

185
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,310
city lord

186
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,960
is probably nothing unusual for you.

187
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,550
But for me

188
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,500
and the citizens of Yandu,

189
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,960
this matter is heartbreaking

190
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,620
and deeply painful.

191
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,240
You suspect

192
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:19,780
that I killed the old City Lord?

193
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,480
There's no need to suspect.

194
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,030
I'm certain.

195
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:24,630
You...

196
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,150
How could this be?

197
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,080
The High Priest...

198
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,240
He can't make such reckless accusations.

199
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,030
You're framing and slandering him.

200
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,150
It was you who established the Wushuang Society,

201
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,480
colluded with the War Demons,

202
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,800
and after being exposed,

203
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:38,080
killed your father and harmed your sister.

204
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,120
Now you even dare to shift the blame onto someone else.

205
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:41,440
If you really have doubts

206
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,790
about the old City Lord's sudden death,

207
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,360
why are you so eager to hold the funeral?

208
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,600
And why did you drug your sister

209
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,950
and have her escorted out of the city?

210
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,240
That's because I didn't want her

211
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,200
to be involved anymore

212
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,240
and continue to be exploited by your despicable schemes!

213
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,510
You're still making excuses.

214
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,390
Tanghua.

215
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,670
He has already

216
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:56,750
said so much.

217
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,520
If you don't let him finish,

218
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,280
it'll make us look guilty instead.

219
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:09,750
Young City Lord.

220
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,750
The old City Lord is no longer with us.

221
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,030
You should know what it means

222
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,910
to say such things

223
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,430
in your position, right?

224
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:21,760
Of course I know.

225
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,910
I'm not only the Young City Lord of Yandu,

226
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:26,480
but also my father's son.

227
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,500
Who wouldn't want to

228
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:30,790
avenge their father's death on the murderer?

229
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:33,990
I'll never rest until you're dead!

230
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,160
Absurd.

231
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,120
Alright then.

232
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,040
I'll say something that's not absurd.

233
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,670
Back then in Pinghu, High Priest Yuanzhong

234
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:46,080
single-handedly quelled the war.

235
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,690
To show gratitude for

236
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,030
the High Priest,

237
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:52,120
our race has been extremely respectful and obedient over the years,

238
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:54,000
sparing no effort or resources

239
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,120
to serve him.

240
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:57,550
But how has the High Priest

241
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:58,790
treated us in return?

242
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,870
Over the past 60 years,

243
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,750
whenever our human race encountered

244
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:04,890
natural or man-made disasters beyond our control,

245
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,790
we'd beseech Liujiao Palace.

246
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:11,440
But when did the High Priest ever help us?

247
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,550
Not even once!

248
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:14,270
That's because...

249
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,870
Doesn't he claim to be a god?

250
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:17,240
Gods receive worship and offerings.

251
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,570
Aren't they supposed to protect all living beings?

252
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:23,480
Besides, recently,

253
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,440
he came down from Fangwai Mountain.

254
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:28,480
Along the way,

255
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,520
tower ships capsized,

256
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,790
and passengers suffered heavy casualties.

257
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,960
Even remote places

258
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,510
like the Orange Lake

259
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,790
have reignited with the flames of war.

260
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,080
Who knows how many of our human civilians

261
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,200
died in the conflict between you

262
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,490
and the War Demons?

263
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,160
As soon as you arrived in Yandu,

264
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,640
my father died.

265
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,870
Is all of this

266
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,870
just a coincidence?

267
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,480
Nonsense!

268
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,440
I think you've truly lost your mind.

269
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,550
Recklessly making accusations!

270
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,870
Do you really think our Youhu Clan is defenseless?

271
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:04,600
The Youhu Clan will not tolerate insults.

272
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:05,550
Today,

273
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:07,730
you must give our clan an explanation!

274
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:08,720
Zhi Yue.

275
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:11,340
You colluded with the War Demons, killed your father, and harmed your sister.

276
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,900
We only came to pay respects to your father first

277
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:16,200
out of consideration for the human race's reputation.

278
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,640
Just because we showed courtesy

279
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,120
doesn't mean we'll let you take advantage

280
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,430
and make baseless accusations and insults.

281
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,030
If you continue to spout nonsense,

282
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,030
just think of what happened to the War Demons

283
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:25,360
in the battle of Pinghu!

284
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,250
Hold on.

285
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:32,960
Dingxu?

286
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,240
Young City Lord

287
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,670
and everyone. How are you?

288
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,200
I, Dingxu, pay my respects.

289
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,680
Why are you here?

290
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,480
Tanghua.

291
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,670
Where I am is not important.

292
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,750
Now,

293
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,030
we're questioning the High Priest, aren't we?

294
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,750
High Priest.

295
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,290
Hostility between the two clans

296
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,650
benefits no one.

297
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,240
As for the rights and wrongs,

298
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,030
why don't you

299
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,750
let me, as a mediator,

300
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,720
ask a couple of questions?

301
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:01,780
What do you want to ask?

302
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,870
I want to ask,

303
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:05,330
High Priest, have you

304
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,870
given up on your thought of

305
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,110
bringing divine punishment

306
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:09,730
and destroying the Mortal Realm

307
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,120
by the power of the Divine Left Hand?

308
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,750
You're awake.

309
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,670
Who are you?

310
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:00,840
I'm the teacher

311
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,200
of the City Lord of Yandu.

312
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:05,310
Everyone calls me Master Yan.

313
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,069
Why am I here?

314
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:10,160
I invited you here.

315
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,200
You used Xue to poison me?

316
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,589
Poison alone wouldn't have been enough.

317
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:17,960
I had to use some other tricks as well.

318
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:19,829
After all, you are a god.

319
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,640
I had to be cautious.

320
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,310
Don't be surprised.

321
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,550
Your identity is no secret

322
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:26,720
to me.

323
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,030
I have no intention of harming you.

324
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:29,900
I just wanted to have you here as a guest.

325
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,290
When the time comes,

326
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,480
I'll certainly let you go.

327
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,960
What do you want?

328
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,440
Dingxu.

329
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,770
What... What are you talking about?

330
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,510
Dingxu.

331
00:17:58,350 --> 00:17:59,960
You just won't give up, will you?

332
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,140
What trick have you come up with this time?

333
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,200
Young City Lord.

334
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:08,000
I may not be able to answer other questions,

335
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,000
but there is one thing that

336
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:11,270
truly has nothing to do with our High Priest.

337
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:12,790
You said that over the past 60 years,

338
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,640
the High Priest has never responded

339
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,720
to your prayers

340
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,310
and never protected you.

341
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:18,830
That wasn't his fault.

342
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:20,960
It was because after the battle of Pinghu,

343
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,970
his spiritual heart became unstable due to too much killing,

344
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,400
showing signs of falling into demonic ways!

345
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,110
After that, to stabilize his spiritual heart

346
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:29,660
and achieve godhood,

347
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,750
he secluded himself for 40 years, not concerning himself with outside affairs.

348
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,070
He only emerged from seclusion

349
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:33,920
after he felt

350
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,350
his cultivation was complete.

351
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,070
Unfortunately,

352
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,030
we were all deceived by him.

353
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,270
Not only did he fail to achieve the body of a demigod,

354
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:42,790
but he fell even deeper into the demonic ways!

355
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:43,550
Dingxu!

356
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,030
What are you trying to do now?

357
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,160
These past few days,

358
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,310
I learned he's come to Yandu

359
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,510
and sensed something was wrong.

360
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,310
So I sent someone to follow him.

361
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:53,310
Soon,

362
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,480
I discovered

363
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,790
a terrifying truth.

364
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,720
He harbors hatred.

365
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,790
He hates the human race,

366
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,400
hates the War Demons,

367
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:05,750
and he hates us, too!

368
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,310
He has been consumed by malice,

369
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,640
harboring thoughts of destroying the world!

370
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,480
This...

371
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,510
This is impossible.

372
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:14,440
Do you all remember

373
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,400
the recent unusual celestial phenomenon?

374
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,680
It was clearly in the middle of the night,

375
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,330
yet suddenly, the sky became bright as day.

376
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,830
It was his doing.

377
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,680
He traveled far and wide,

378
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,440
unlocking one by one

379
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,920
the five weapon spirits of the Divine Hand.

380
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,720
And he ordered them

381
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,030
to go to the Five Extremities,

382
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:33,750
while he himself came to Yandu,

383
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,550
intending to use the Divine Hand as a starter,

384
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:36,920
exploit the powers/might of earth and heaven

385
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,680
to enact divine punishment,

386
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,830
and destroy all the living beings he deems guilty

387
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:40,480
in this world!

388
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,160
When the time comes,

389
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,270
thunderbolts will level mountains,

390
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:45,930
underground fires will scorch wastelands,

391
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,480
floods will submerge towns,

392
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:48,510
and everything in this world

393
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:50,070
will cease to exist!

394
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,200
You... You're talking nonsense!

395
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:55,070
Whether it's true or not, he's right here.

396
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:55,830
Ask him yourself!

397
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,600
Yuanzhong, he's spouting nonsense,

398
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,380
and none of this is true, right?

399
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,440
Dingxu.

400
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:06,200
You're truly shameless.

401
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,070
Did I say anything wrong?

402
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,960
Isn't this what you planned?

403
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,350
Isn't this what you

404
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,400
told me yourself?

405
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,510
Are you going to deny it?

406
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,270
Young City Lord Zhi Yue.

407
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,790
I don't know if he really is

408
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,440
the one who killed your father,

409
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,310
or even what

410
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,400
that Wushuang Chamber of Commerce

411
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,440
you established does

412
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,920
and whether it has colluded with the War Demons.

413
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,210
None of this matters anymore.

414
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,750
He is a demon spawn

415
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:36,970
with the intent to destroy the world.

416
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,790
No one in this world will survive!

417
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,160
Leaving the Divine Hand

418
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,310
in the hands of such a person

419
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:42,850
is our sin!

420
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,240
Heaven-Turning Seal!

421
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,000
High Priest.

422
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,750
Since you've fallen into demonic ways,

423
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,640
anyone has the right to eliminate you.

424
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:55,680
Today, even if it means mutual destruction,

425
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,750
you won't leave here alive!

426
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,400
Members of the Youhu Clan,

427
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:00,920
have you still not come to your senses?

428
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:03,010
Do you all intend to fall into demonic ways?

429
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:09,720
All commanders, heed my order!

430
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,440
Slay the evil demon!

431
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:35,960
I never expected that

432
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,640
after 60 years,

433
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:41,000
I would still witness this scene.

434
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,680
It's truly nostalgic.

435
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,750
Old scoundrel Dingxu.

436
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,400
You've really gone to great lengths

437
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:52,240
to extend your miserable life.

438
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:54,340
I underestimated you.

439
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,270
Indeed,

440
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,830
I once had the thought of destroying the world,

441
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:02,640
but someone has

442
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:04,490
made me abandon that thought.

443
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,750
What?

444
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,510
Do I need to be punished

445
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:09,270
for a thought

446
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,310
I once had?

447
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:14,110
Thoughts can change in an instant.

448
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,880
What if you change your mind, High Priest?

449
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,240
Do you expect us

450
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,750
to entrust the fate of the world

451
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:20,730
to your

452
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,690
whims and fancies?

453
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,640
You, with a demon's heart, wield the power of god alone.

454
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,880
A single thought from you can determine life and death for all.

455
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,420
That's why you can't live!

456
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,160
Accept your fate.

457
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,550
This is your original sin.

458
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,240
Old scoundrel.

459
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,800
You've finally said it.

460
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,200
I've already spared your lives,

461
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:45,830
yet you failed to appreciate it.

462
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:49,810
Don't blame me for being merciless then.

463
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:54,000
Sixty years ago, I managed to slaughter my way through Pinghu.

464
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:58,390
Today, I can just as well massacre Yandu.

465
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:04,830
Yuanzhong...

466
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:09,310
Attack!

467
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,510
Jiuguang, take Zhi Dai and leave here first!

468
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,210
Got it!

469
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:28,700
Let's go.

470
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:00,960
Baili Xiang.

471
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:02,070
He's fallen into demonic ways.

472
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,430
It's not too late for you to turn back now.

473
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:05,440
That's right! Don't be stubborn and deluded!

474
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,510
You two old fools.

475
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:07,590
You believe everything you hear!

476
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:08,720
Internal strife is one thing.

477
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,510
How can you betray the High Priest in public?

478
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,480
Tanghua, escort them to leave first.

479
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:06,750
Grand Elder.

480
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:11,360
Grand Elder.

481
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,750
You've come to Yandu but haven't shown yourself.

482
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:16,790
What's the intention of all this hiding?

483
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,680
There's something

484
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,720
I need your help with.

485
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:24,830
What is it?

486
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,680
You'll know when you see it.

487
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,230
Yuanzhong!

488
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:45,850
Let's go!

489
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:14,850
You came quite fast.

490
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:18,270
He risked his life to follow you,

491
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,650
yet this is how he ended up.

492
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,680
Wasn't Baili Xiang killed by you?

493
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,910
I've treated him well in this life,

494
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:27,750
guiding him at every turn, teaching him at all times.

495
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:29,480
I can say I've done right by him.

496
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,300
The road to the underworld is long.

497
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:34,880
What if he gets lost again?

498
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,270
Why don't

499
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:39,000
you go guide him one last time?

500
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:47,590
Guards!

501
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:52,680
Yuanzhong, leave here first.

502
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,480
Think of Ji Tanyin.

503
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:55,440
They won't just go after

504
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,270
you alone.

505
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,590
Hurry up and leave!

506
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:00,310
Be careful.

507
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,110
I never thought that

508
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:23,510
I would see a god again in my lifetime.

509
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:25,310
I originally thought

510
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,960
Zhi Yue was radical.

511
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,660
I thought since the time wasn't right,

512
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,750
our human race shouldn't have

513
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,030
revealed ourselves so early.

514
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,120
But I didn't expect

515
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:40,090
Zhi Yue would go this far.

516
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:48,030
What is this?

517
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,720
It's called the Primordial God-Binding Net,

518
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,790
a magical artifact specifically designed

519
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:54,070
to imprison gods.

520
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,270
I don't like this name.

521
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,440
If I had created it,

522
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,510
I would have named it the Formless Circle.

523
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:02,070
Look.

524
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:04,030
It's a thunder-based magical artifact,

525
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,180
refined from the purple thunder of the North Sea.

526
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,370
It can be big or small, formless and shapeless.

527
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,990
It has no power on its own,

528
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,480
but with you inside,

529
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,480
you've become the magic source of this magical artifact.

530
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:17,030
Everything in nature has its own strengths and weaknesses.

531
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:18,680
Even gods cannot

532
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,960
be completely fearless.

533
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:23,100
Just like this magical artifact.

534
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,680
Although it's harmless to humans,

535
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:34,510
it's a powerful tool for imprisoning gods.

536
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:36,880
Using gods' power to imprison gods,

537
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,440
isn't that amazing?

538
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:40,400
How did you obtain

539
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,440
this magical artifact?

540
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,920
Who gave it to you?

541
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,960
Since you already know the answer,

542
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:49,500
why bother asking me?

543
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,750
So even gods also fight for power and profit,

544
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:54,150
and scheme against each other.

545
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,270
In this aspect,

546
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:58,650
you're not much better than those in the Mortal Realm.

547
00:28:59,160 --> 00:28:59,960
Why are you

548
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,830
keeping me here?

549
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,440
What exactly do you want to do?

550
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,380
I might as well tell you.

551
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,550
We made a deal with

552
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:08,440
a god from your Divine Realm.

553
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,510
We'll help her kill

554
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:11,260
Yuanzhong, the High Priest of the Youhu Clan,

555
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,640
and in return, she'll allow War Demons to return to the Divine Realm

556
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,160
and never set foot in the Mortal Realm again.

557
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:16,270
Without War Demons

558
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:17,720
and the High Priest,

559
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:19,200
how could those members of the Youhu Clan,

560
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,270
who are unproductive,

561
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:22,380
gluttonous, lazy, and stupid,

562
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,910
possibly withstand

563
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,650
the army of craftsmen from our human race?

564
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,240
Moreover, I've obtained

565
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,790
what I wanted for myself.

566
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:32,350
In 100 years,

567
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,270
perhaps even sooner,

568
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,350
in this world,

569
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:40,080
there will be no more immortal sects.

570
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:44,280
Only the grand momentum of the human race will remain.

571
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:52,360
What's your name?

572
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,200
What's your position among gods?

573
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,070
Why did you come to the Mortal Realm?

574
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,830
And why have you been with

575
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:59,240
the High Priest of the Youhu Clan,

576
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:00,830
acting as his handmaiden

577
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:02,340
with the identity of a god?

578
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,140
The Mortal Realm hasn't been

579
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,030
visited by gods for hundreds of years.

580
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:09,240
I thought gods

581
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,790
no longer existed.

582
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:12,850
Wasn't the celestial ladder broken?

583
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:14,650
How did you come here?

584
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,160
Were you born into the divine race,

585
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:19,080
or did you ascend through personal cultivation

586
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,830
to become a god?

587
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:25,480
You are nice to Yuanzhong.

588
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,920
Could it be that you were once a member of the Youhu Clan?

589
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:33,280
Don't waste your efforts.

590
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,480
You won't be able to get out.

591
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:37,440
Why don't you talk to me instead?

592
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,440
Let me out.

593
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,750
Are all of you from the divine race like this?

594
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:46,510
Possessing divine power

595
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:47,790
but lacking intelligence.

596
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:50,030
No wonder you were so badly beaten by the demon clan.

597
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:51,160
Let me out!

598
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:52,510
That's why the management of the Six Realms

599
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,000
should have been handed over to us humans long ago.

600
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,240
If we had such long lifespans

601
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,510
and such strong power,

602
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,880
how could we have been taken advantage of by a few demons?

603
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:03,000
Look at this mess of a world!

604
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,000
This is all the sin of your divine race!

605
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:05,480
What exactly

606
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,830
do you intend to do to Yuanzhong?

607
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:09,790
I'm telling you, you can't!

608
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:11,000
I won't allow it!

609
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,960
What can you do if you don't allow it?

610
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,590
If I wish,

611
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,000
you will never be able to leave

612
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,960
this room.

613
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,950
Even if he's chopped into mincemeat,

614
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,960
what can you do?

615
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:30,450
All creatures are born from the primordial power.

616
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:32,800
All beings are equal.

617
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:36,590
Although we humans are weak,

618
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:39,220
we are intelligent.

619
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:41,750
We are good at innovation

620
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,330
and endurance.

621
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,680
We endure diseases, coldness,

622
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,880
loneliness, and disasters.

623
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:50,350
We are like wild grass,

624
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,110
not to be dispersed by the wind,

625
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:53,590
and not to be extinguished by fire.

626
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,790
But once we have a chance,

627
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:59,070
we will spread across the entire land!

628
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,590
But what about you?

629
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,590
Foolish,

630
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:06,200
arrogant,

631
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,350
and obsessed!

632
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:09,510
You're so worried and anxious.

633
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,960
Don't tell me you've fallen in love with

634
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,350
that High Priest of the Youhu Clan.

635
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,680
As expected from a god.

636
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:18,770
Full of compassion,

637
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,720
letting emotions cloud your judgment!

638
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,640
Shut up!

639
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:01,000
High Priest.

640
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:03,070
We meet again.

641
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,960
What a coincidence.

642
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:07,400
You

643
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:09,510
are not what you used to be.

644
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:12,350
This is all thanks to you, High Priest.

645
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,280
You're injured?

646
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:16,790
Likewise.

647
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:19,550
I should also thank you for that.

648
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,889
The Perfect War Demon's power

649
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,760
is nothing special after all.

650
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,900
Drain his blood first.

651
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,920
Then we can cut off his Divine Hand

652
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:31,940
and kill him.

653
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:33,150
Form the formation!

654
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:09,890
All mortals, heed my command.

655
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,560
It's God. It's God.

656
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:23,500
God has manifested.

657
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:29,880
Yuanzhong, the High Priest of the Youhu Clan,

658
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:31,610
has fallen into demonic ways.

659
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,400
He harbors the thought of destroying the world,

660
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:35,060
and is an enemy of all living beings.

661
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:37,580
Whoever slays this demon,

662
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,200
even if they perish,

663
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:42,150
their divine soul will be protected by all gods

664
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:43,590
and be guided to the Heavenly Realm,

665
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,630
enjoying infinite blessings

666
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,550
for tens of thousands of years.

667
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:49,270
It's Hannv.

668
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,550
It's Hannv.

669
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:53,630
Yuanzhong is in danger.

670
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:11,230
Why?

671
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:31,690
Qian Lin?

672
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,970
Call me Qian Lin, the Perfect War Demon.

673
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,930
♫The flowing water does not compete for the lead♫

674
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:37,910
No way.

675
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:40,850
♫For millennia, all will turn to dust♫

676
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,960
You couldn't possibly have become the Perfect War Demon.

677
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:44,100
♫With our feet on the earth and the sky above♫

678
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:43,320
You think there's only one way

679
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,760
to create the Perfect War Demon?

680
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:47,860
♫We, the heroes of our time, are no ordinary beings♫

681
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,150
Yuanzhong, I've figured it out.

682
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:50,680
♫The flowing water does not compete for the lead♫

683
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,230
The elephant has been bound by the rope

684
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:54,280
♫In my heart, there are no ripples, as if a god resides within♫

685
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:52,070
from a young age.

686
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,400
Since it couldn't break free back then,

687
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,880
it believed it could never break free.

688
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,780
♫I ride the wind and embrace the moon♫

689
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,880
It submitted to that rope.

690
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,280
So did I.

691
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:01,280
♫The raging river in my dreams has never ceased♫

692
00:36:58,710 --> 00:36:59,460
My hatred

693
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,410
is the rope that binds me.

694
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:03,130
♫The flowing water does not compete for the lead, and I want to be like the flowing rivers, lakes, and seas♫

695
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,450
Why are you here?

696
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:04,700
♫The flowing water does not compete for the lead, vast and surging♫

697
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,920
Where's Ji Tanyin?

698
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,420
♫In my heart, there are no ripples, love, hatred, gratitude, or grudges, as if a god resides within♫

699
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:06,190
We were set up.

700
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:08,080
♫In my heart, there are no ripples, as if a god resides within, while disputes and entanglements repeated countless times♫

701
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:08,190

702
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,100
♫I ride the wind and embrace the moon, and I want to conquer the world without struggle♫

703
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:09,440
Yuanzhong,

704
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,800
I'll hold these people off for you.

705
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:11,310
♫I ride the wind and embrace the moon, just like water that nothing can fight♫

706
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,670
You go save her.

♫The raging river in my dreams has never ceased, able to take on and let go, neither arrogant nor impatient♫

♫The raging river in my dreams has never ceased, only a steady stream can be considered humble♫

709
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:25,630
It's useless.

710
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:27,230
You can't possibly get out.

711
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:29,150
I've told you that

712
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:30,230
this is a magical artifact

713
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:31,800
from your Divine Realm,

714
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,030
specifically designed to restrain

715
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:34,670
you gods.

716
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:37,110
You're wasting your energy.

717
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,230
What?

718
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:43,070
You've given up?

719
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,670
What are you doing?

720
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:31,000
Kill him! Kill him!

721
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:45,840
Go home.

722
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:47,460
It's dangerous here. Leave!

723
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,120
It's dangerous here. Go!

724
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:50,590
Go home! Go!

725
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:55,930
Kid, go home!

726
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,370
It's dangerous here. Go!

727
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:58,450
Go!

728
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:22,140
I killed him.

729
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:23,960
God!

730
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,670
I killed him!

731
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,920
I killed the demon!

732
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,960
I'm going to become a god!

733
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,800
By eliminating this demon, I can become a god!

734
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,630
He is a demon!

735
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:32,880
He wants to kill us!

736
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,760
Kill him!

737
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,250
Kill him! Kill him!

738
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,190
Kill him! Kill him!

739
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:39,480
Kill him! Kill him!

740
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:41,840
Kill him! Kill him!

741
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:44,320
Kill him! Kill him!

742
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:46,760
Kill him! Kill him!

743
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,190
Kill him! Kill him!

744
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,590
Kill him! Kill him!

745
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:53,760
Kill him! Kill him!

746
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,150
Kill him! Kill him!

747
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,510
Kill him! Kill him!

748
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:00,920
Kill him! Kill him!

749
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,760
Kill him! Kill him!

750
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,110
Kill him! Kill him!

751
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,590
Kill him! Kill him!

752
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,630
Kill him! Kill him!

753
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:28,540
In the battle of Pinghu,

754
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,640
you eliminated countless War Demons.

755
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,110
Your achievements are unparalleled, and your merits  are immeasurable.

756
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:35,060
We should worship you.

757
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,880
But now, with a great enemy before us,

758
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:38,800
the mortal realm needs your protection.

759
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,670
I hope you can put aside past grievances

760
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,610
and fulfill your rightful duty,

761
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,360
living up to the divine artifact's choice.

762
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,030
Doesn't he claim to be a god?

763
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,230
Gods receive worship and offerings.

764
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:49,040
Aren't they supposed to protect and bless all living beings?

765
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:50,330
You, with a demonic heart,

766
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:52,430
♫Wind chimes beat with my heart♫

767
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,590
wield the power of god.

768
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:53,000
This is your original sin.

769
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:53,960
Do you understand?

770
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:56,200
♫Harmonizing, can you recognize it?♫

771
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,480
My father said there's something big happening in the city today.

772
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,280
No one is allowed to play on the streets.

773
00:40:57,050 --> 00:40:59,920
♫Fingertips tracing your outline♫

774
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,630
You should go home too.

775
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:03,120
♫I wish to see through you♫

776
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:07,470
♫Whether near or far♫

777
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:11,550
♫We can still gaze upon the same galaxy♫

778
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,670
Kill him! Kill him!

779
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:18,420
♫Knowing we've never been apart for a moment♫

780
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,000
Yuanzhong, get up!

781
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,510
Ji Tanyin is still waiting for you!

782
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:18,280
Hurry up and go!

783
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:21,700
♫If our promise♫

784
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:25,480
♫Is to share this land and rivers♫

785
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:29,020
♫If fate leads us astray♫

786
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:33,370
♫Life and death become our bond♫

787
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,560
♫Storms heal with time♫

788
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:41,010
♫Memories will shine in the end♫

789
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,440
Yuanzhong, look.

790
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:46,730
♫That very first heartbeat, I will remember until the last♫

791
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:43,410
Two flowers have bloomed in the pond.

792
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:44,720
Yuanzhong.

793
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:46,590
I will always be with you.

794
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:52,210
You've extracted your divine bone?

795
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,320
You are Goddess Wushuang?

796
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,000
You look so devout,

797
00:41:58,330 --> 00:41:59,920
yet you don't even recognize your own god.

798
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,520
Being your god

799
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,400
makes me feel ashamed.

800
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,280
Kill him! Kill him!

801
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,280
Kill him! Kill him!

802
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,230
Kill him! Kill him!

803
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:32,850
Kill him! Kill him!

804
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:51,550
How dare you?

805
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:52,900
Why shouldn't I dare?

806
00:42:57,170 --> 00:42:58,690
This thing can only imprison gods.

807
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,150
I'm no longer a god.

808
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,880
You can't trap me.
