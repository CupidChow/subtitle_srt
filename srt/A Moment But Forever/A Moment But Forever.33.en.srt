[A Moment But Forever]

00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:47,200
[Episode 33]

3
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,350
Barrier?

4
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,870
Someone is coming.

5
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:18,910
Open the barrier.

6
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:19,900
Let them in.

7
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,470
Listen to me.

8
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,670
Go and take a look.

9
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,280
Yuanzhong?

10
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,120
Tanghua?

11
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,000
After we left Yandu,

12
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,080
we came to find you.

13
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,840
How did you find us?

14
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,910
We heard news of you from the human race.

15
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,470
Zhi Dai brought us here.

16
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,520
Dingxu is not dead.

17
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,910
I guess he's lucky.

18
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,590
You killed Baili Xiang

19
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:26,530
and were then rescued.

20
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:29,130
He must have been scared out of his wits

21
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,630
and fled back to Fangwai Mountain overnight.

22
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,110
I've already sent Jiuguang and some others back

23
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,120
to keep watch.

24
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,280
If anything happens,

25
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,560
I'll know.

26
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,560
And what about the War Demons?

27
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,240
That day, I passed out from exhaustion

28
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,520
and was captured.

29
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,240
I don't know where they went.

30
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:48,240
But I doubt

31
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,400
they'd give up so easily.

32
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,470
They'll definitely try to keep hunting you down while you're still badly injured.

33
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,310
Didn't you encounter them

34
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,520
on your way here?

35
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,870
We encountered them once.

36
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,240
I dumped them.

37
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,250
Miss Ji, you really have remarkable skills.

38
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,150
In the blink of an eye, you tossed Yandu

39
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,150
to the Chili Mountain area,

40
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,240
which is hundreds of miles away.

41
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,240
With such godlike skills,

42
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,000
a few War Demons

43
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,900
were naturally no big deal to you.

44
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,390
That's not a problem.

45
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,240
With our abilities,

46
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,310
even if the three races join forces again to attack us,

47
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,160
we can hold them off.

48
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,830
But that goddess...

49
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,270
Why did she want to kill you?

50
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,830
Will she come again?

51
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:45,000
Will she send others to come this time,

52
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,010
or will she do it on her own?

53
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,310
Have you thought about these things?

54
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,270
No need to think too much.

55
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,920
If she comes again,

56
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,159
I'll face her head-on.

57
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:55,920
Plenty of people want me dead.

58
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,120
A god like her won't make a difference.

59
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,190
You have guts.

60
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,750
I haven't thanked you yet.

61
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,240
That day, you appeared like a warrior descended from heaven,

62
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,310
with extraordinary combat prowess.

63
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:11,920
Even your chief

64
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,070
was no match for you.

65
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,750
After your enlightenment,

66
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:15,470
you must have already

67
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:16,890
reached the stage of the Perfect War Demon, right?

68
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:19,270
No need to thank me.

69
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:20,750
I wasn't doing it for you.

70
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,360
Curly, we haven't seen each other in years.

71
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,950
Aren't you happy to see an old friend?

72
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,670
Who's your old friend?

73
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:32,409
I don't make friends

74
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,000
with a crybaby.

75
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,780
Who's a crybaby?

76
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:41,530
They're not

77
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,800
all going to stay here, are they?

78
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:43,600
There aren't enough rooms

79
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,560
or blankets here.

80
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,270
And there's a War Demon.

81
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,720
I can't see War Demons.

82
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,480
I'll break out in rashes

83
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,270
if I see them.

84
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,430
We'll leave soon.

85
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,240
Yandu still

86
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,159
needs Zhi Dai to return

87
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:55,070
to take charge of the situation.

88
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,000
And I have to hurry back to Fangwai Mountain.

89
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,920
Now that I see you're safe,

90
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,360
I'm relieved.

91
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,120
There's no rush to leave.

92
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:03,800
At least tomorrow,

93
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,800
you can have a drink at our wedding

94
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,600
before you go.

95
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,750
That's not a problem.

96
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,560
With our abilities,

97
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,190
even if the three races join forces again to attack us,

98
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,000
we can hold them off.

99
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,360
But that goddess...

100
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,720
Why did she want to kill you?

101
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,800
What is it?

102
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,680
Are you really going to marry him?

103
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,170
Do you even like him?

104
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:00,990
Forget it.

105
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,870
I already know the answer.

106
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,160
But about that matter,

107
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,430
do you have an answer now?

108
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,160
What matter?

109
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,160
Yuanzhong.

110
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,950
Did he really fall into demonic ways?

111
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,120
Was the goddess in the clouds

112
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,720
trying to kill him because he has

113
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,040
fallen into demonic ways?

114
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:17,120
Since you don't trust him so much,

115
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,630
why did you help him?

116
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,630
Well, there's no conclusion yet, right?

117
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:23,950
If he had died like that,

118
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,870
you would have definitely been heartbroken.

119
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,159
I can assure you

120
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,240
that Yuanzhong has definitely not fallen into demonic ways.

121
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,390
What happened before

122
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,750
must have been a misunderstanding.

123
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,120
Perhaps

124
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,390
he was lost for a while,

125
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,830
but he came to his senses

126
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,190
just before going too far.

127
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,870
As for that goddess in the clouds…

128
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,720
I know.

129
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,120
Don't worry.

130
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,560
I'll take care of it.

131
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,720
That's good.

132
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,240
By the way,

133
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,480
there's something

134
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,680
I want to ask you.

135
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,480
What is it?

136
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:02,560
On the journey recently,

137
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:03,870
have you encountered

138
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,600
any strange people or events?

139
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,190
Why do you ask that?

140
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,270
I just feel that Miss Zhi Dai

141
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,310
is a little off.

142
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,680
Even the way she looked at me

143
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,800
was a bit strange.

144
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,800
What's so strange about that?

145
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,510
In the blink of an eye,

146
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,740
you tossed Yandu City to the mountains

147
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,680
hundreds of miles away.

148
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,040
Such a magical skill

149
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,160
is godlike.

150
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,240
Now,

151
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:28,030
people are saying that you are also a god.

152
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,120
She is just an ordinary person.

153
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,000
Seeing you,

154
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,200
she would naturally be scared.

155
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:46,590
Have you made up your mind?

156
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,870
Where are you?

157
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,200
Come out!

158
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:58,960
I'm a god.

159
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,900
Gods are everywhere.

160
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:05,120
You're not a god. You're a devil!

161
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:06,390
It seems you still can't

162
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,320
make up your mind.

163
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,550
What? Are you really not afraid?

164
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:11,480
He has fallen in love with you.

165
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:12,670
But do you think

166
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,000
that if he sees you old,

167
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,440
with white hair and wrinkled skin,

168
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,120
he would still love you the same?

169
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,960
I will never let you control me.

170
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,390
How foolish.

171
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,670
You think you can fight against me?

172
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,840
I'd rather die

173
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,200
than let you get your way!

174
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,910
Actually, what Dingxu said that day

175
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,440
wasn't entirely a lie.

176
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:03,640
I know.

177
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,870
Then why did you help me?

178
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,150
What's the big deal

179
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,300
about wanting to destroy this world?

180
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,240
During the years

181
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,600
you were locked under Tianqu Peak,

182
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:16,540
I thought about it

183
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:17,930
many times every day.

184
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,440
Sometimes I wanted to set a fire

185
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,510
and burn down Fangwai Mountain,

186
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,960
and sometimes I wanted to poison Dingxu,

187
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:24,480
then skin him, tear out his bones,

188
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,720
and throw him out of the mountain gate.

189
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:27,960
But they were just thoughts.

190
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:29,910
In this world, we judge a person

191
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,320
based on their actions, not their thoughts.

192
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,550
If just having bad thoughts

193
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,600
would lead to judgment,

194
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,320
none of us would be alive.

195
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,510
But what if I really do that?

196
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,390
I've told myself

197
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,510
that in this life,

198
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,000
I can only let you down once.

199
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,030
Do you know who Ji Tanyin is?

200
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,030
That day, when she came to save you,

201
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,440
she threw Yandu hundreds of miles away

202
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,790
in the blink of an eye.

203
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,020
Some say

204
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:08,960
she has divine magic that can move mountains and seas,

205
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,910
while some say Yandu

206
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,080
is just a giant Linglong House.

207
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,960
Ji Tanyin is a top-tier craftsman.

208
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,200
She might even be

209
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,600
the creator of Yandu.

210
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,200
No matter what,

211
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:20,390
she's definitely not

212
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,720
an ordinary person.

213
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,480
You want to marry her?

214
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,840
Do you really know her?

215
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,910
I don't need to know her.

216
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,720
I just need to know

217
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,480
that she loves me,

218
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:35,470
and that's enough.

219
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,510
Tanghua,

220
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,870
do you know

221
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:40,840
what the first thought

222
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,600
that flashed through my mind was

223
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,240
when I woke up that day?

224
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,790
What was it?

225
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,910
I was glad that I didn't stand by

226
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,600
and watch Chiyi and Xiazhi die.

227
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:51,670
Why?

228
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,200
When I woke up,

229
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,790
Tanyin was right by my side.

230
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,670
Looking at her,

231
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:16,750
I quickly replayed my life

232
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:17,790
in my mind.

233
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:19,840
Then I felt relieved.

234
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:21,510
I told myself

235
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,750
that I was lucky.

236
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,510
Luckily, I had

237
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:26,720
a crazy plan.

238
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:28,960
Luckily, I once thought about

239
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,510
bringing the whole world to the grave.

240
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,350
Luckily, I didn't kill anyone prematurely.

241
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,080
I stopped

242
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,960
before I committed

243
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,390
any unforgivable sins.

244
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,750
If I had really been covered in blood,

245
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,600
with sins all over me,

246
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,200
she wouldn't have fallen in love with me.

247
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,910
and she wouldn't have stayed by my side.

248
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:52,960
I'm so lucky.

249
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,080
Thank goodness.

250
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,200
I didn't expect it.

251
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,630
Who would have expected it?

252
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:14,120
That day, when I was at the end

253
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,320
of my rope on the street of Yandu,

254
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:18,720
she descended from the sky.

255
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,550
At that moment,

256
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,480
I suddenly realized

257
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:26,550
that she was the gift

258
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:27,750
given to me by heaven.

259
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:30,380
It was precisely because she was so precious

260
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,110
that heaven made me

261
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,910
go through so many trials.

262
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,240
Fortunately, I made it through.

263
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:39,480
So,

264
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,550
I must keep her.

265
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,910
No one can

266
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,200
take her away from me.

267
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:48,710
No one.

268
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,150
Alright.

269
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,480
Just get married to Miss Ji

270
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,600
and live a good life.

271
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:03,040
Live a comfortable and happy life!

272
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:05,870
And get back all the grievances

273
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,200
you've suffered these years from that damn heaven.

274
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:09,960
No one

275
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,440
can disturb your good life.

276
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:12,720
Not Dingxu,

277
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,390
not the War Demons,

278
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,600
and not even the gods in heaven.

279
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,420
Whoever tries to make trouble for you,

280
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,720
I'll fight them with my life.

281
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,670
Then you'd better practice.

282
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,440
I don't think

283
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:30,960
you can even beat Qian Lin now.

284
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,720
Don't mention that strange brat.

285
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,150
Let me tell you.

286
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,320
How many years have I practiced?

287
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,550
How old is that brat?

288
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,870
Just because he's a War Demon,

289
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,910
I can't beat him.

290
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:51,910
Why?

291
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,030
Don't worry.

292
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,750
Sooner or later...

293
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,840
Sooner or later, I'll beat him up.

294
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:02,530
Beat him up...

295
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:06,550
Someone asked me to bring you a message.

296
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,270
She said

297
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,200
you would be able to tell

298
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,440
if it's a lie.

299
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,030
That person said

300
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,280
Ji Tanyin is not an ordinary person;

301
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,120
she is a goddess.

302
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:26,750
You know?

303
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,600
She is Goddess Wushuang,

304
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,240
the creator of the Divine Left Hand.

305
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,670
He once trained two students

306
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,120
with high reputations.

307
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,840
One of them is Goddess Wushuang,

308
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,870
who has ascended and is now a god.

309
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,390
Just treat me as

310
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,790
a god's image hanging on the wall.

311
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:53,750
I can always bless you

312
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:54,840
and bring you good luck.

313
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,510
She came to your side

314
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:58,780
to take the Divine Left Hand from you

315
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,440
and return it to the supreme god of the Divine Realm,

316
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,000
Deity Taihe.

317
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,720
I will stay by your side,

318
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,069
until the moment you die.

319
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,450
You must not leave me.

320
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,440
Don't ask about my past.

321
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,160
Absolutely, absolutely

322
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,560
do not fall in love with me.

323
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:16,750
High Priest Yuanzhong,

324
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,589
she came to your side

325
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,230
to wait for your death.

326
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:23,430
She doesn't love you.

327
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,440
I saw your future.

328
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,030
By then,

329
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:11,000
you will have white hair but a youthful face,

330
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,720
surrounded by your children and grandchildren.

331
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:17,170
♫Time never defeats the fleeting world♫

332
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,550
You will be full of kindness and ease,

333
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:21,150
♫Stars turn, shining upon the passing traveler♫

334
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,070
joy and peace.

335
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:23,400
You will grow old together with one person.

336
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:24,080
♫The wind rises, flowers fall and bloom again♫

337
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:28,220
♫Awaiting what's lost to be regained♫

338
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,640
And many others will envy you.

339
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,400
In the end,

340
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:31,560
♫These countless sorrows and joys♫

341
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,830
you will find fulfillment

342
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:35,990
♫Dusk and dawn, only you make parting hard♫

343
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,160
and live a life that, when you look back on it,

344
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,920
is filled with endless happiness.

345
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:41,670
♫I'm willing to risk my life for this♫

346
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,440
But with whom will I

347
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,070
spend a fulfilling life?

348
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:46,390
♫If our promise♫

349
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:49,590
♫Is to share this land and rivers♫

350
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:53,690
♫If fate leads us astray♫

351
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:57,390
♫Life and death become our bond♫

♫Memories will shine in the end♫

♫That very first heartbeat, I will remember until the last♫

♫That very first heartbeat, I will remember until the last♫

356
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,960
So beautiful!

357
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,270
Have you seen Yuanzhong?

358
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,160
I'll go out and take a look.

359
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,750
What's wrong? Where's Yuanzhong?

360
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,200
I haven't seen him all morning.

361
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,470
I looked all around outside,

362
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:33,270
but I couldn't find him.

363
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:34,480
How come?

364
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,920
Today is his wedding day.

365
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,070
Where could he have gone?

366
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,750
Is there any other barrier

367
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:39,960
in your Fragrant House

368
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,550
that leads to

369
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:41,720
somewhere we don't know about?

370
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,200
What should we do?

371
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,510
It's almost time.

372
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,160
Where did he go?

373
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,720
I'll go look for him again.

374
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:50,590
Miss Ji.

375
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,070
Don't worry.

376
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:53,800
Yuanzhong must have had something urgent to do.

377
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,300
He should be back soon.

378
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:03,730
You know where he is?

379
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,610
I don't.

380
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,070
You met him last night.

381
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,150
What did you tell him?

382
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:19,270
Why are you so afraid of me this time?

383
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:20,880
I'm not.

384
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:21,750
You're lying!

385
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:23,880
Miss Ji.

386
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,160
Is there any misunderstanding?

387
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:26,110
Zhi Dai came here with me

388
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:27,080
all the way from Yandu.

389
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:28,330
She is definitely not your enemy.

390
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,500
Zhi Dai!

391
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,300
Who sent you here?

392
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:47,160
Tell me!

393
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,120
Goddess of Embroidery.

394
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:09,590
Ji Tanyin,

395
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:11,480
come and find me.

396
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,880
You're here.

397
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:42,960
Zi Fei told me

398
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:46,860
that Xie You has two outstanding disciples.

399
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,350
One is the Mute Lady of Wu Mountain,

400
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:51,740
and the other one

401
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:54,400
is Goddess Wushuang.

402
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:57,480
I guessed half of the truth

403
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:00,640
but overlooked the other.

404
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,790
Ever since I can remember,

405
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:11,750
this jade token

406
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,350
has always been with me.

407
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,200
I treat it as a protective charm

408
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:19,510
and have been worshiping it.

409
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,640
We of the Youhu Clan,

410
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,350
once we take human form,

411
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,510
we forget everything from before.

412
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,640
So...

413
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,270
it's yours,

414
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:40,310
right?

415
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:43,280
Back then, I was seriously injured

416
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,110
and frozen in Wu Mountain.

417
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:50,740
It was you who awakened me

418
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,640
and took away this half of the jade token.

419
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:58,840
So, we've known each other for a long time.

420
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:05,310
The goddess I met in my youth

421
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,830
was also you?

422
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,070
Yes.

423
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,790
So it's fate.

424
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:25,860
No wonder you didn't kill me.

425
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,200
No, Yuanzhong.

426
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,870
I didn't kill you

427
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:38,480
because I knew

428
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,520
you were a good person.

429
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,880
You don't deserve to die.

430
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:43,560
A good person?

431
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:53,000
A good person?

432
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:57,000
Ji Tanyin,

433
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:00,480
do you really know me?

434
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,430
I've never been a good person.

435
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:07,750
When I was young,

436
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,830
I was competitive and ambitious,

437
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:13,590
eager to stand out

438
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,790
and make a name for myself.

439
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:16,400
After obtaining the Divine Hand,

440
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:18,400
I became greedy for success.

441
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:20,510
In just the Battle of Pinghu alone,

442
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,350
many War Demons

443
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,700
were killed by me.

444
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:27,330
Later, I was set up by my clan.

445
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,720
I got sealed and imprisoned.

446
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,680
I spent 40 years under Tianqu Peak,

447
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,110
without seeing the light.

448
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,350
I became a sinister

449
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:36,770
and vicious devil,

450
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,920
bent on revenge.

451
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,160
You must have heard

452
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,830
my prayer that day, right?

453
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,980
I wanted to destroy this world.

454
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,350
I wanted to drag everyone down to their deaths.

455
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:49,880
Could someone like me

456
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:54,030
be a good person?

457
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,270
No.

458
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,580
But you didn't do it, Yuanzhong.

459
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,400
You're not...

460
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:02,410
That's because you are too kind.

461
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:05,240
You're so kind that it's terrifying.

462
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,640
You're so kind

463
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,310
that you once wanted me to stay away from you

464
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,880
and even wanted me to kill you.

465
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,240
Because I was afraid

466
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,000
that I might be swayed because of you.

467
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,310
Those who have been in the abyss for too long

468
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,830
shouldn't bask in the sun.

469
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,790
The sun is too warm,

470
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,400
and it makes one yearn.

471
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,620
But I was still enlightened by you.

472
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:47,030
I developed desires

473
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,160
and wanted to be with you.

474
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,640
I wanted you to love me.

475
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:54,110
I thought if I

476
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:54,880
fell in love with this world,

477
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,240
you would fall in love with me.

478
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,740
But now that I've fallen in love with this world,

479
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,830
you still don't love me.

480
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:06,280
No, Yuanzhong.

481
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:08,680
Yuan...

482
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,480
No?

483
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:16,920
Am I wrong?

484
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,850
Do you love me?

485
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,510
I...

486
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:36,060
I'll always be with you.

487
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:43,200

488
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:47,010

00:34:39,389 --> 00:34:41,020
In the Divine Realm, there are two kinds of gods.

567
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,880
One type practices benevolent laws,

568
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,150
cultivates virtues,

569
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,280
and accumulates immeasurable magical power over countless lifetimes,

570
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:48,230
ultimately reaching complete enlightenment through contribution.

571
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:50,070
Both Hannv and I

572
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:51,710
brought benefit to the people through our skills,

573
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,400
and with this merit, we ascended to the Divine Realm.

574
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,989
We belong to this type.

575
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,440
The other type of gods

576
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,440
enters the world by transcending causality,

577
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,920
experiencing birth, death, and all kinds of suffering,

578
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:03,150
yet they remain unaffected by grief,

579
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,360
resentment, jealousy, or hatred.

580
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,480
They sever all obsession,

581
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,280
refraining from listening, seeing,

582
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:13,550
and longing,

583
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,550
and with a heart of cessation, they cultivate the spirit of benefiting all beings,

584
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,450
ultimately reaching complete enlightenment through suffering.

585
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:22,070
Deity Taihe and the gods of the Thunder Division

586
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:23,400
are all like this.

587
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:25,720
In the past, I never understood

588
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:28,080
why gods who reached enlightenment through suffering

589
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,030
held higher status and power than those

590
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:32,800
who achieved it through contribution.

591
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,070
Now, I understand.

592
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:40,550
Enduring countless tribulations without changing one's original intention,

593
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,110
and without hatred, anger, or resentment,

594
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,240
is truly difficult.

595
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:48,040
At least,

596
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:50,190
I cannot do it.

597
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,400
Greetings, My Lords.

598
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,840
Ji Tanyin, do you admit your crime?

599
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,110
What crime do I have?

600
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:42,630
As a god,

601
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,440
you put personal matters before public duty,

602
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,760
disobeyed orders,

603
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,630
destroyed your divine bone, and abandoned your divine position,

604
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,550
disregarding the safety of the Three Realms.

605
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,360
Aren't these all crimes?

606
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:54,920
I destroyed my divine bone

607
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:56,880
because I was set up by Hannv.

608
00:36:57,130 --> 00:36:58,860
She revealed her divine power in the mortal realm without permission,

609
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,150
deceived mortals into

610
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:01,230
besieging Yuanzhong,

611
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:03,280
and colluded with humans to imprison me.

612
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:04,840
In order to escape,

613
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,290
I had no choice but to destroy my divine bone.

614
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:09,230
My Lords, I sincerely ask you to investigate this thoroughly.

615
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:11,230
Hannv's actions

616
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:12,790
were all carried out under our orders.

617
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:16,320
Why?

618
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,730
You descended to the mortal realm in the first place

619
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,760
to search for the Divine Left Hand

620
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,000
and revive Taihe.

621
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,560
Since you were unwilling to do it,

622
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:26,280
we had no choice but to let Hannv do it for you.

623
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,800
But My Lords,

624
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,320
you've promised me

625
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:31,000
that I could take the Divine Hand after Yuanzhong

626
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,150
lived out his natural life.

627
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,800
I've been keeping my promise.

628
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,550
How could you go back on your word?

629
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:37,630
Things have changed.

630
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,190
We agreed to your request back then

631
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,990
because he had committed no grave offense,

632
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:42,950
his sins did not warrant death,

633
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,000
and you vouched for him with your life,

634
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,880
though reluctantly.

635
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:47,960
But now,

636
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,440
he wants to destroy the world,

637
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:51,850
and his demonic intent is plain to see.

638
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:53,850
As a god,

639
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,710
not only did you not punish him impartially,

640
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:58,150
you even protected him out of personal feelings.

641
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:00,690
If not for your repeated interference,

642
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,950
he would have already perished

643
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,630
and the Divine Hand would have returned to the Divine Realm long ago.

644
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:08,880
And we wouldn't have to waste words today.

645
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:10,750
My Lords, please allow me to explain.

646
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,670
I have my reasons for what I did.

647
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,670
You want to make excuses?

648
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:17,920
I am not making excuses.

649
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:18,920
In the mortal realm,

650
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,320
I met a weapon spirit by chance.

651
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,400
It was born from the divine lantern I created.

652
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,070
During the war between gods and demons,

653
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:24,880
he witnessed with his own eyes

654
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,820
that Deity Taihe was actually the Demon Lord.

655
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,590
In his fear,

656
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:28,880
he fled the Heavenly Realm.

657
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,840
Insolence!

658
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,210
How could you believe the words

659
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:34,320
of a mere weapon spirit?

660
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:38,340
Deity Taihe was a Primordial God

661
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:42,070
and had protected all beings for thousands of years.

662
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:44,880
How dare you slander him here?

663
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:49,510
Just because he made contributions,

664
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:50,840
does that mean he doesn't make mistakes?

665
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,440
The cause of the war between gods and demons

666
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,710
was already quite suspicious.

667
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,630
Since there is evidence,

668
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:55,920
why can't we investigate it?

669
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,190
Moreover,

670
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,000
when I returned to the Heavenly Realm last time,

671
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:00,440
Hannv obstructed me in every way

672
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,800
from meeting you

673
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:03,240
and even sealed the Ascension Platform,

674
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:04,840
preventing my primordial spirit from returning.

675
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,230
She was so apprehensive.

676
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:07,280
Doesn't that

677
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,510
make you suspect her?

678
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:10,800
Nonsense!

679
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:12,190
We are all clear

680
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,710
about what Hannv is like.

681
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:15,840
You protected your host in the mortal realm

682
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:16,980
and disobeyed the orders.

683
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:19,670
Hannv has said a lot of good things about you.

684
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:20,800
As the divine official

685
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,230
who guided you when you ascended,

686
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,880
she not only taught you

687
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,010
but has also treated you like a sister.

688
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:31,710
Have you forgotten all of this?

689
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:34,110
It's one thing that you are ungrateful,

690
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:35,870
but now you're slandering her.

691
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:38,060
Do you have no conscience?

692
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:00,660
Goddess Wushuang,

693
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,550
to revive Taihe,

694
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:05,190
you risked your life crossing the Sea of Flux.

695
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:06,620
That was a great merit.

696
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,320
For this reason,

697
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:10,190
we can overlook

698
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:11,590
all your wrongdoings.

699
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,550
But just now,

700
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:14,670
I sensed that

701
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:16,390
the Divine Hand has already left

702
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:17,570
the host's body.

703
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:20,460
So, you should hand it over,

704
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,760
and I will help you regain your divine bone

705
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:25,320
and restore your position in the celestial ranks.

706
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:29,060
As for the things you are suspicious about,

707
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:31,920
we can reinvestigate them

708
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,440
and give you an explanation.

709
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,670
Give it to us.

710
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:40,010
The Divine Realm will not forget your contributions.

711
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,190
How dare you!

712
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:04,580
Although the gods of the Thunder Division have cold personalities,

713
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:06,530
they have always been upright.

714
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,510
They never lose their temper

715
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:08,630
and harm others

716
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:10,800
just because they are contradicted.

717
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,230
Whenever there is doubt, they always investigate,

718
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,360
and whenever they investigate, they do so thoroughly.

719
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,070
They never avoid the issue or speak in circles.

720
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,480
Most importantly,

721
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,550
they would never

722
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:19,800
be blinded by emotions.

723
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,550
I know it's you, Hannv!

724
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:40,890
I underestimated you.

725
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:45,960
Where are the gods of the Thunder Division?

726
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,070
Those old fellows

727
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:50,700
do nothing but sit in meditation all day.

728
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,070
With just a mere embroidery,

729
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,840
I deceived their five senses

730
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,360
and isolated them in the Discipline Hall.

731
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:59,370
Now, everything they see and feel

732
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,080
is an illusion created by the embroidery.

733
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,840
By the time they notice something's wrong,

734
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:05,510
it will already be too late.

735
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:09,940
See?

736
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,370
Even Mr. Loong was suppressed by me.

737
00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:18,000
Now, it's just you and me.

738
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:20,590
If you still regard me as your sister,

739
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:23,480
hand over the Divine Hand.

740
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,520
The Divine Hand is with me.

741
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:26,570
Where's Taihe?
