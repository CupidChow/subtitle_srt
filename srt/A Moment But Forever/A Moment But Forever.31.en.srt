[A Moment But Forever]

00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,220
[Episode 31]

3
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,950
Watch your step.

4
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:55,920
In the Fragrant Grove,

5
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,560
there's a friend of mine

6
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:00,000
who specializes in spatial barrier techniques.

7
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,640
We can take shelter at her place

8
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,430
for a while.

9
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,120
Stop hiding.

10
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,560
Come out now.

11
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,430
If you don't,

12
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:17,750
I'll tear your place

13
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,710
down.

00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:29,270
[Youhu Clan, Curly]

15
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,400
Yuanzhong, what brings you here?

16
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,710
We came as guests,

17
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,360
and yet you don't even offer us tea?

18
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,750
Tanyin,

19
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,030
this is my childhood friend.

20
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,590
Just an acquaintance.

21
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,520
You can call her Curly.

22
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,079
She was born with curly fur.

23
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,240
When she was little,

24
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,150
she once stole Dingxu's Heaven-Turning Seal

25
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,280
just to straighten her fur

26
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,950
and almost got crushed to death by it.

27
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,150
I didn't steal it. I just borrowed it.

28
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,470
Why did you laugh?

29
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,870
I laughed because it was funny.

30
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,280
Is laughing

31
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,960
not allowed here?

32
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,560
After that, she caused some trouble

33
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,870
and couldn't stay in the clan anymore.

34
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,840
I gave her the Fragrant Grove

35
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,470
so she'd have a place to live.

36
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:49,120
She once told me

37
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:50,840
she owed me a favor.

38
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,710
She promised to repay me no matter what,

39
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,030
even if it meant going through

40
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,400
extreme challenges.

41
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,000
Now,

42
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,190
it's time for her to make good on that promise.

43
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,680
So that's why

44
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,750
you asked me to bring you here?

45
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,590
Curly's other spells

46
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,590
are mediocre at best,

47
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,710
but when it comes to spatial barrier techniques,

48
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,310
she is exceptionally skilled.

49
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,150
When she was a kid and got into trouble,

50
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,840
she'd always hide,

51
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,240
and no one could find her.

52
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:15,960
She really had some skills.

53
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,370
What does that mean?

54
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,269
Are you here to take my life?

55
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,680
Not to take your life.

56
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,920
Just to stay for a few days.

57
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,430
That's basically the same as taking my life!

58
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,040
This place is so cramped,

59
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,040
with three people living here,

60
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,560
constantly bumping into each other.

61
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,840
How could we possibly live like that?

62
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,000
What?

63
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,560
We can't stay?

64
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,470
No.

65
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,480
I can tell you're hurt,

66
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,120
so you must be going through something.

67
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,370
But you're more than

68
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,310
capable of

69
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,750
finding a safe spot.

70
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,600
Why must you...

71
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,610
Why must you put someone else in a tough spot?

72
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,560
Right?

73
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,830
Since I'm here,

74
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,920
I have my reasons.

75
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,190
I don't care about your reasons!

76
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,600
You simply can't stay here.

77
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,160
What about the favor you owe me?

78
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,310
I'd go through

79
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,600
any extreme task for you,

80
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,240
but you can't stay here!

81
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,920
You know me.

82
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,370
I just can't tolerate it.

83
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,510
Alright.

84
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,120
Then we have no choice

85
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,510
but to return to Fangwai Mountain.

86
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,190
Oh, by the way,

87
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,510
your three elder sisters

88
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,070
miss you very much,

89
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,430
especially your second sister.

90
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:28,870
She's been longing to see you.

91
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,070
Your second sister

92
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,870
is really blessed.

93
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,630
She has a happy marriage and a flourishing family.

94
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,310
She now has eight children.

95
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,870
The youngest still hasn't mastered transformation.

96
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,800
If they find out you're here

97
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,360
and all come to visit,

98
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:43,770
the Fragrant Grove

99
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,510
will be bustling.

100
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:49,310
Wait!

101
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,159
If you want to stay here,

102
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:55,720
you'll have to follow my rules.

103
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,270
You're just temporary guests here,

104
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,560
not the owners.

105
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,680
You'll have to take care of

106
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,830
your own food, clothes, shelter, and transport.

107
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,040
Don't expect me to serve you.

108
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,240
I'm not in the habit of waiting on anyone.

109
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,920
Oh, by the way,

110
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,360
you're Yuanzhong's servant girl, right?

111
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,920
Take good care of him

112
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,740
and make sure he leaves as soon as possible.

113
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,720
Is this your kitchen?

114
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:14,560
Yes.

115
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,560
It's very clean.

116
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,270
Even the stove is spotless.

117
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,120
Do you never cook with fire?

118
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,300
Lighting a fire to cook is too troublesome,

119
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,190
and the dust is hard to clean.

120
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,000
I always eat fresh fruits

121
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,920
and raw food.

122
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,750
We prefer cooked food

123
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,720
and hot meals.

124
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,560
These are all medicinal herbs.

125
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,800
There's so much of it.

126
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,000
Really?

127
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,310
I thought it was just some wild greens.

128
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,120
I gathered them from the forest.

129
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,310
They taste awful.

130
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,120
Extremely bitter.

131
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,950
Yuanzhong is seriously injured;

132
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,190
he needs medicine to recover.

133
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,270
Do you have any tools

134
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,680
for decocting herbs?

135
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:00,040
I wasn't done speaking yet.

136
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:00,950
Well,

137
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,830
the two rooms on the east side are for you.

138
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,920
That loft is my bedroom.

139
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,310
I usually

140
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,830
eat, rest,

141
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:10,070
read, train, and meditate there.

142
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,870
All of that is important to me.

143
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,390
If you have nothing urgent, don't disturb me.

144
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,950
Even if you do, it's best not to.

145
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,070
So, if we

146
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,120
ever need to find you,

147
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,160
what should we do?

148
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,160
Write a letter.

149
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,070
See that mailbox

150
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,680
in the courtyard?

151
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,000
If you need something,

152
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,560
just put a letter in there.

153
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,000
I'll check it once a day at 7 p.m.

154
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,040
If I need anything,

155
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,720
I'll contact you the same way.

156
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,070
Looks like you won't be leaving

157
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,920
in just a few days, huh?

158
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,870
Then let's set some rules now.

159
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,340
No one disturbs anyone,

160
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,510
and we each keep to ourselves.

161
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,510
Sounds good?

162
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,060
I wasn't finished talking.

163
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,070
Let me tell you about

164
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,800
my daily routine.

165
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,750
As long as we avoid

166
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,390
using the same space

167
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:01,390
for the same things

168
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,510
at the same time,

169
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,560
we won't run into each other

170
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,270
or cause any trouble.

171
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,600
I usually wake up at 9 a.m.,

172
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,630
wash up at 10:15 a.m.,

173
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:09,680
eat at 10:45 a.m.,

174
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,950
and train at noon.

175
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,870
Are you done yet?

176
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:12,480
Not yet.

177
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,430
That was just the fifth rule.

178
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:14,560
There's still the sixth.

179
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,230
This place originally belonged to Yuanzhong, didn't it?

180
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,620
Yes.

181
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,750
But now I live here,

182
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,950
so it's mine.

183
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,920
We had no choice but to come here,

184
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,270
but we won't stay long.

185
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,750
I'll do my best

186
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,000
to follow your rules,

187
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,310
but if I can't,

188
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:32,539
I hope you can be understanding.

189
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,720
I haven't finished it yet!

190
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:36,840
Write it down.

191
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,929
I haven't mentioned the sixth rule yet.

192
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,030
Curly isn't a bad person.

193
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,390
She's just a little reclusive.

194
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,870
It's not a big deal.

195
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,790
Are you still bothered by what happened in Yandu?

196
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,840
I'm not upset.

197
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,670
I just don't get it.

198
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,120
Don't get it?

199
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,120
You're not a villain,

200
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,270
and you haven't hurt anyone.

201
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,320
Why did they

202
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,360
treat you like that?

203
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,230
Humans are treacherous,

204
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,150
and easily swayed by the crowd.

205
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,630
And when divine forces

206
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:21,720
come into play,

207
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,120
their choices seem inevitable.

208
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,960
This shouldn't have happened.

209
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,510
You're too clever

210
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,440
to not understand this.

211
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,120
You just feel that...

212
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,550
I feel sorry for you.

213
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,200
I feel that you are treated unfairly.

214
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,150
Leaving aside the War Demons,

215
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,720
at the very least, the humans and the Youhu Clan

216
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,390
should've been grateful to you.

217
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,270
They should have remembered your kindness.

218
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,270
It shouldn't have turned out this way.

219
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:05,750
Throughout this long journey of escape,

220
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,440
you've endured so much.

221
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,870
You've mentioned it countless times already.

222
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I must say it again.

223
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:14,120
No matter how many times I say it, it's never enough.

224
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,150
Actually, over the past few days,

225
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,630
I wasn't entirely unconscious.

226
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,120
I woke up a few times,

227
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,240
feeling disoriented and confused.

228
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,720
Each time I woke up,

229
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,960
I could hear your voice.

230
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:28,480
I thought to myself,

231
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,600
heaven hasn't been too harsh with me.

232
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,280
At least I met you.

233
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,670
There's something

234
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,840
I haven't told you.

235
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,320
Actually, back then,

236
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,840
what you saw in my sea of consciousness

237
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,030
wasn't the whole picture.

238
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:49,950
They call me the demon,

239
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,320
and that's not entirely untrue.

240
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,910
During the forty years I was locked away,

241
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,510
I had a thought.

242
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:01,290
I believed the world was full of sin,

243
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,030
that human nature was inherently evil.

244
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:04,600
Always hungry, seeking to be filled;

245
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,070
when cold, yearning for warmth;

246
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,630
when warm, craving pride, luxury, and indulgence;

247
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,000
always desiring more.

248
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,750
So,

249
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:14,320
I wanted to use the Divine Left Hand as a sacrifice

250
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,670
to pass judgment on all the sins in this world.

251
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,670
Those who bore the Five Sins

252
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:21,720
would be consumed by Heavenly Fire.

253
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,390
I believed that, given how corrupt the world was,

254
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,440
once the judgment was made,

255
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:31,260
everything would be purified and transformed into a clear, bright place.

256
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,550
From the moment I was freed,

257
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,200
I was resolute in carrying out this plan.

258
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,360
I thought, since the world had wronged me,

259
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,150
I would repay its evil with vengeance on all.

260
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:45,840
But,

261
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,200
fate had me meet you.

262
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,320
Ji Tanyin,

263
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,720
you have always treated me with genuine sincerity,

264
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,590
never pretending,

265
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,680
and saving me from danger over and over again.

266
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:01,790
At first, I doubted you.

267
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,440
I couldn't believe someone like you

268
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,240
could exist in this world.

269
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,360
And I couldn't believe that heaven

270
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,750
would show any favor to someone like me.

271
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,360
But gradually,

272
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,240
I started to like you.

273
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,360
My heart became attached,

274
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,150
and I felt a sense of longing.

275
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,550
I was afraid,

276
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,220
afraid that I might falter.

277
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:31,200
So, when we were at Orange Lake and Yandu,

278
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:33,120
I pushed you away

279
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,420
because I was afraid that, because of you,

280
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,840
I would lose myself.

281
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,030
In the battle at Yandu,

282
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:52,960
even though the whole world criticized me,

283
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,560
even though I was cornered,

284
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,030
I never regretted it.

285
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,000
When you gain something,

286
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:01,030
you will inevitably lose something.

287
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,960
I gained the Divine Left Hand,

288
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,750
and with it, the power

289
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,320
to rival the gods.

290
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,870
So naturally,

291
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:11,150
I lost the simple life of an ordinary person.

292
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,270
And I gained you,

293
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,230
so whatever else I lose,

294
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,320
I wouldn't care.

295
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,240
They say the Mute Lady of Wu Mountain

296
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,150
guides all living beings,

297
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:29,150
neither a god nor a deity, yet greater than one.

298
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:31,720
Ji Tanyin,

299
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,550
you truly transformed me.

300
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:37,790
You saved the world

301
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:40,550
and me.

302
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,630
Yuanzhong,

303
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,960
there's something I...

304
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,630
I, actually...

305
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:17,320
What happened?

306
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,720
I was hurt by Master Yan before,

307
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:28,750
sustaining some internal injuries.

308
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:30,910
It's nothing serious.

309
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,700
Glad to hear that.

310
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,270
Glad to hear that.

311
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,240
Sorry.

312
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,200
Why are you apologizing?

313
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:53,910
Sorry, Yuanzhong.

314
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:56,240
Sorry, Yuanzhong.

315
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,120
You're worried about the High Priest.

316
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,000
Right now, everyone in the world

317
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,120
is searching for Yuanzhong.

318
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,390
Whether the past events were true or not,

319
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,120
his Divine Left Hand

320
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,790
truly has the power to destroy the entire world.

321
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:35,840
You're afraid now.

322
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,550
Back then, Yuanzhong punched

323
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:40,720
through Pinghu.

324
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,550
They tried every possible method

325
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:43,510
to seal him.

326
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,240
Now that they know he has the ability

327
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,550
to destroy the entire world,

328
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,120
they'd want to bring him down even more.

329
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,790
Now that you're the Lord of Yandu City,

330
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,720
with such an identity,

331
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,200
it's really inappropriate for you to be here.

332
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,000
That's exactly

333
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,390
why I should come.

334
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,870
Not because of you.

335
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,960
The High Priest isn't a bad person.

336
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,000
We can't just try to

337
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,270
eliminate someone

338
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:07,320
because they have power and we're afraid.

339
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,960
If that's the case,

340
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:09,960
then there would be too many people in this world

341
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,840
who deserve to be killed.

342
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:18,720
What are you talking about?

343
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:20,910
It doesn't concern you.

344
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,370
Then let's talk about something that does concern me.

345
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:25,870
I've brought back the food.

346
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,960
It's your turn to take care of the rest.

347
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,270
The river is over there.

348
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,240
Go take care of it.

349
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:34,870
I'll go.

350
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:36,950
Let him go.

351
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:43,750
I'll go with you.

352
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,150
Fu Jiuyun said Taihe is a demon.

353
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:52,750
What exactly happened during the war between gods and demons?

354
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,150
Why did Hannv stop me

355
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,200
from meeting the gods

356
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,550
from Thunder Division?

357
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:00,270
Did she know something?

358
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:02,630
I don't know why, but the Ascension Platform

359
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:03,670
can't be opened.

360
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,480
I need to think of another way

361
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,550
to return to the Divine Realm.

362
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:09,030
But I've lost my divine bone.

363
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,200
What should I do?

364
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:17,349
How are you?

365
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,440
Are you alright?

366
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,200
I'm fine, don't worry about me.

367
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:29,160
Your eyes will definitely heal.

368
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:31,830
I know.

369
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:35,890
Are you trying to drink some water?

370
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,510
I'm thinking of going for a walk.

371
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,110
I'll come with you.

372
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,480
Alright.

373
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,110
Come on.

374
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,750
Be careful.

375
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:51,720
Watch the steps.

376
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,750
There's a water wheel on the right ahead,

377
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,000
do you remember?

378
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:03,880
There's a beautiful little garden ahead

379
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,680
on the left.

380
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:08,030
There's even a swing inside.

381
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,980
♫Too many old dreams♫

382
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,680
What are you laughing at?

383
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,200
Nothing.

384
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:15,440
♫Where did the snow fall to?♫

385
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,070
Why do I feel

386
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:20,060
♫Going to face a catastrophe♫

387
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,000
you're laughing with a smug expression?

388
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:20,400
Well,

389
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:23,280
♫No one is irrelevant♫

390
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,240
I suddenly remembered when we were at Fangwai Mountain.

391
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,750
Back then,

392
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,510
someone was

393
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:27,640
so clumsy

394
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:29,540
♫A slight ripple in my gaze♫

395
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,830
and not as careful as now.

396
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:33,290
♫Who knows the warmth and cold of my fleeting life?♫

397
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,030
Who is "someone?"

398
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,110
Just name me directly.

399
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,350
It's fine to say it's me.

400
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:37,970
♫If staying together is difficult, it's not worth it♫

401
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,480
How can I do that?

402
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,440
After all, I'm blind now,

403
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,030
and still need your care.

404
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,030
♫I'll return what's left of my life♫

405
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,550
What if I upset you

406
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,550
and you ignore me?

407
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,830
What should I do then?

408
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,300
♫Falling into the mortal world♫

409
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:46,470
♫Wandering through the clouds and rivers♫

410
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:50,400
♫Being by your side is like finding the shore♫

411
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,960
Let's go for a walk.

412
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:51,310
Go out?

413
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,730
♫If between oaths♫

414
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,810
♫I hold onto the longing for just one more glance♫

415
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:53,960
It's fine.

416
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:55,720
At night, the Fragrant Grove is shrouded in mist,

417
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:58,630
♫Unwilling to bid farewell for good♫

418
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,400
which acts as a natural protective barrier.

419
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,750
Even if we go out now,

420
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,510
it won't be so easy to be discovered.

421
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,690
♫Tears grow cold in a single cup♫

422
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,990
♫Longing fades in half♫

423
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,310
Then let's go early and come back early.

424
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:08,190
♫Like flowers in a mirror, or the moon in the water♫

425
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:15,760
♫The lonely guest can't sleep, destiny can't be undone; speechless♫

426
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:19,300
♫Falling into the mortal world♫

427
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:21,390
♫Wandering through the clouds and rivers♫

428
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:25,340
♫Being by your side is like finding the shore♫

429
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:24,110
What's wrong?

430
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,850
♫The moon falls by the riverbank♫

431
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,480
There's a tree ahead,

432
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:30,020
♫The light finally dims♫

433
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:29,710
a big pear tree.

434
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:34,030
♫How can my heart be at ease?♫

435
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:33,160
I feel like I've seen it somewhere before.

436
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,740
♫Tears grow cold in a single cup♫

437
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,760
♫Longing fades in half♫

438
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:43,260
♫Like flowers in a mirror, or the moon in the water♫

439
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:53,470
♫The lonely guest can't sleep, destiny can't be undone; speechless♫

440
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,480
Come on.

441
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,270
This place is so beautiful.

442
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:00,270
No wonder Curly likes it.

443
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:03,790
Do you like it too?

444
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,350
I do.

445
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,230
Then let's live here too,

446
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,110
how about it?

447
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,790
But Curly will be so angry.

448
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:17,590
Then we'll

449
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,360
find an even more beautiful place,

450
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:22,160
build a house,

451
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,680
plant a tree,

452
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,480
dig a pond,

453
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,550
and raise some fish.

454
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,110
Xue and I

455
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:30,510
can cook,

456
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,220
so we'll take care of you.

457
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,480
As for you,

458
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:35,010
when you're free,

459
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:36,750
you can do some carpentry work,

460
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,400
sell it at the nearby market,

461
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,110
and make some money.

462
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,640
How about

463
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,940
we live a simple and peaceful life

464
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,270
like that,

465
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:54,230
Tanyin?

466
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,070
You say you can cook,

467
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,030
but I don't believe it.

468
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,240
I really can.

469
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,000
I studied it seriously.

470
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,640
This place is quite far from Fangwai Mountain.

471
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,590
How did you

472
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:13,750
find this place?

473
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:15,960
It wasn't me,

474
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:18,280
it was my father who found it.

475
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,310
Your father?

476
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:22,960
Since the day I was born,

477
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:24,550
the Youhu Clan and the War Demons

478
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,590
have been in constant conflict.

479
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,350
My father, worried that our clan would not prevail,

480
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,270
found this place,

481
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,470
believing that in times of danger,

482
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,590
he could bring the clan here to seek refuge.

483
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,720
This place is like a paradise,

484
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,760
and the mist serves as a natural barrier.

485
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:43,000
It truly is a perfect place to seek refuge.

486
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,790
What about you?

487
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,200
How did you grow up?

488
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,350
Were your parents nice to you?

489
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:55,920
Would you prefer not to talk about it?

490
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,110
I was thinking,

491
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:02,510
how should I put it?

492
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,590
My mother's health was always poor,

493
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:09,750
and she passed away when I was young.

494
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,710
Since I was little,

495
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,920
it was just my father who took care of me.

496
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:17,480
But it's been

497
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,160
so long now.

498
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:22,000
His image in my memory

499
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,000
has already become blurry.

500
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,310
My father was an incredible craftsman,

501
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:29,960
and he had very high expectations for me.

502
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,590
If I made a mistake,

503
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:33,960
I'd get a slap on the hand.

504
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,000
But even when I did things right,

505
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:37,680
he would always complain,

506
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:39,640
saying, "If only

507
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,200
you were a boy."

508
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,270
It felt like

509
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,440
no matter what I did,

510
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,880
no matter how hard I tried,

511
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:50,220
he was never satisfied.

512
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,960
Then later, I went up the mountain

513
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,720
and began learning the craft from my master.

514
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,550
When I really think about it,

515
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,310
the time I spent with my father,

516
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,510
as his daughter,

517
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,960
was actually quite limited.

518
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:08,400
Maybe it's because your craftsmanship is so remarkable

519
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,510
that

520
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:11,510
he's so strict with you.

521
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:14,190
Shouldn't he praise me for that?

522
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,030
Most humans

523
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:18,750
tend to favor sons over daughters,

524
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:21,110
always hoping for a son

525
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,640
to take over the family business.

526
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,110
Is that the case with the Youhu Clan?

527
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,110
It's a bit better here.

528
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:31,400
What's wrong with having a daughter?

529
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,960
Well, you've asked the wrong person.

530
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,310
I can't say anything positive about it.

531
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,240
Don't tell me you share that view.

532
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,160
I don't favor sons over daughters.

533
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:44,680
It's just some personal grudges.

534
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:46,680
Personal grudges?

535
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,790
I have an elder sister.

536
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,110
She's mischievous

537
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:53,680
and loves to fight.

538
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,270
Whenever

539
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,550
she gets into trouble outside,

540
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,510
my parents always compare me to her,

541
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,750
constantly speaking ill of her.

542
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,110
But you're not

543
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,440
much different from her.

544
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,110
Compared to her,

545
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:08,920
I'm still a bit better.

546
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:11,350
Whenever my father

547
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,440
scolded her,

548
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:15,160
she would always find a way to take her frustration out on me.

549
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,480
I was beaten by her

550
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:18,240
since I was little.

551
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,110
So, you just tolerated it?

552
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:19,830
No.

553
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:21,480
After I got up,

554
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,790
I went to complain to my father.

555
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:23,920
And then,

556
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,030
I got beaten again.

557
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:34,920
Tanyin,

558
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,590
that day in Yandu,

559
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:39,640
how did you save me?

560
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:43,960
Just like that.

561
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:45,350
Like what?

562
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,240
I fought my way out.

563
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,510
You've forgotten.

564
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,340
I have a mechanical bird that can fly.

565
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:55,680
No one can stop me.

566
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,720
I remember,

567
00:24:58,590 --> 00:24:59,790
before I fainted,

568
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,030
your mechanical bird

569
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:02,550
had already been destroyed.

570
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,070
It... It was destroyed after I saved you.

571
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,480
Really?

572
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,790
It's quite cold here at night.

573
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:19,200
You're still injured.

574
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,540
Let's go back first.

575
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,600
Alright.

576
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:27,790
Come on.

577
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,350
You've forgotten.

578
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,160
I have a mechanical bird that can fly.

579
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,240
No one can stop me.

580
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,000
Heaven and Earth are the primal source, from which all energies arise.

581
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,350
Born of deep wisdom, all things return to their origin.

582
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,510
Yandu, gather!

583
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,640
How are you feeling? Better?

584
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,030
Much better.

585
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,720
After applying the medicine a few more times,

586
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,310
your eyes

587
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:03,680
will recover soon.

588
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,510
I'll head back now.

589
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:08,590
I woke up early this morning

590
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:10,440
just to avoid Curly.

591
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,830
Don't worry.

592
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,070
Actually, Curly is even more timid.

593
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:16,440
Her personality is a bit strange.

594
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:17,750
Has she always been like this?

595
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,790
I suppose so.

596
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,240
Curly

597
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,750
was born into a large family.

598
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:26,030
We've known each other since childhood.

599
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:29,680
While others could transform in about 10 years,

600
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,070
it took her

601
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:32,960
50 years.

602
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,030
We all thought

603
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,790
she wouldn't be able to transform at all.

604
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,400
The Youhu Clan

605
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,680
is generally laid-back in personality,

606
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:42,880
with our fair share of bad habits,

607
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,350
but Curly's habits

608
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:46,820
seem even stranger.

609
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,510
Reclusive?

610
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,640
Yes, and her fur is different.

611
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,960
While others have smooth, straight fur,

612
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,270
hers

613
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:08,750
is curly.

614
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,920
Because of this,

615
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,400
she's often the subject of ridicule.

616
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,550
As for her,

617
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,350
she couldn't fight back,

618
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:17,240
always getting the short end of the stick.

619
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,750
Over time,

620
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:20,240
she developed the habit of avoiding people whenever possible.

621
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,640
But her skill in barrier magic

622
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,590
is impressive.

623
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:25,480
She's the type who learned it all on her own, without a teacher.

624
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,640
She often uses her barrier magic

625
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,110
to hide herself away.

626
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:31,110
The whole family will search for her for days,

627
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,370
but she just won't come out.

628
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,160
It might be because she's upset or angry.

629
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,750
Sometimes that's true,

630
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,640
but most of the time,

631
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:54,070
it's simply because there are too many people,

632
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:56,000
and she finds it annoying.

633
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,590
I see.

634
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,110
So after she transformed,

635
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:03,640
she stopped talking.

636
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:06,070
It wasn't until she got a pet

637
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,030
that she gradually started to improve.

638
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:55,350
Curly's life is very structured.

639
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,160
Four,

640
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:58,070
three,

641
00:29:58,510 --> 00:29:59,310
two,

642
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:00,580
one.

643
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:14,960
She doesn't want to learn

644
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:16,350
the clan's methods of cultivation.

645
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,960
While she excels at Barrier Spell,

646
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,350
no one else in the clan can do it,

647
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,240
which is why

648
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:23,160
she relies on

649
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,640
breathing techniques

650
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,160
to absorb spiritual energy

651
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,200
at noon.

652
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:36,590
The midday sun holds the essence of fire,

653
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,650
containing the sun's true flames.

654
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:42,680
It's the purest, most potent energy, burning through everything.

655
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,590
Especially at noon,

656
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,920
when the sun is at its peak.

657
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,270
If she continues

658
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:51,750
to absorb its energy,

659
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:52,830
she may eventually

660
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:56,640
achieve enlightenment and become a god.

661
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,850
How do you know all of this?

662
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,550
I... My master taught me.

663
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,510
You know, he's really powerful.

664
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:15,750
Maybe.

665
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,590
She always says

666
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,750
the spiritual energy she absorbs at noon

667
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:20,920
is the sweetest

668
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:22,880
and the most comfortable.

669
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:27,100
By the way,

670
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:29,160
she wrote a letter to us.

671
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,110
I can't read it.

672
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:32,830
I'll read it to you.

673
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,030
I'll wake up at 9 a.m.

674
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:40,270
Before then, I'll be asleep,

675
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:42,030
so please keep quiet.

676
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:43,920
At 9 a.m. sharp,

677
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:47,240
I'll wash up and come out to fetch water.

678
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,430
At 9:30 a.m...

679
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:49,240
Enough.

680
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,030
I know her routine well.

681
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:55,960
She's reminding us

682
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,240
not to come out carelessly,

683
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,960
to avoid running into her.

684
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,240
She was the same

685
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:02,680
back at Fangwai Mountain,

686
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,200
but no one really paid attention to it.

687
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,000
Still, you don't need to worry about her.

688
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,880
That's not right.

689
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:12,200
After all, we're at her place,

690
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:12,750
and we should

691
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:14,070
respect her rules.

692
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:14,960
Besides,

693
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,550
she mostly stays in her room

694
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:17,720
and doesn't come out.

695
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,750
Honestly,

696
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,960
it's not an inconvenience at all.

697
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,480
Alright.

698
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,960
Is that the reason

699
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,720
she left Fangwai Mountain?

700
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:32,000
The situation back then

701
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,400
was much more complicated.

702
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:35,590
At the time,

703
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:38,030
the War Demons and the Youhu Clan were already in conflict.

704
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:41,240
Curly's father was a general in the War Division.

705
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:43,270
Even though he knew about Curly's condition,

706
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,720
he still forced her

707
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,790
to join the battlefield.

708
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,550
It wasn't due to a lack of soldiers,

709
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
but because

710
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,070
he wanted her to be an example

711
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:51,200
for the clan.

712
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,000
As you can imagine,

713
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:56,980
Curly's condition only worsened.

714
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:58,440
If I hadn't secretly

715
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,590
rescued her,

716
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:01,160
she might have

717
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:03,550
already lost her sanity by now.

718
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:10,550
I should have been more considerate toward her.

719
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:28,720
Why aren't you following the rules?

720
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:29,920
It's noon now,

721
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,510
which means it's clearly my time

722
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:31,830
to be out and about.

723
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,350
How's it going?

724
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,750
Look,

725
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:47,250
the float is broken.

726
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,830
It should be 1 p.m. now,

727
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:52,510
not noon.

728
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:01,920
I knew it.

729
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:02,830
I've been feeling

730
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:04,270
a bit off lately.

731
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,270
I thought I was getting sick.

732
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:07,630
Don't worry.

733
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,070
I can fix it for you.

734
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,110
You?

735
00:34:10,489 --> 00:34:11,230
Of course.

736
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,110
It's all fixed.

737
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:20,739
It's fixed?

738
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:22,550
That was quick!

739
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:25,929
Quick indeed.

740
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:27,840
You're amazing!

741
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,880
Here, take it.

742
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:35,920
What's this?

743
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,440
It's a bamboo dragonfly I made.

744
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:39,710
Does it actually fly?

745
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:40,760
Of course it does.

746
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:46,000
What book are you reading?

747
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:50,250
"Legend of Immortals."

748
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:52,440
It tells the story of a remarkable woman

749
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,630
who, on the fifteenth of July at 7 a.m.,

750
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:56,480
with purple clouds swirling in the sky,

751
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,840
flags and banners waving,

752
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,030
and everyone watching,

753
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,110
saw her soar towards the heavens,

754
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:01,320
rising higher and higher,

755
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,920
until she entered the Divine Realm

756
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,880
and became a god.

757
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:06,670
But this is just a fictional tale,

758
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:08,000
dreamed up by someone.

759
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:09,440
It shouldn't be taken literally.

760
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:11,800
Why can't it be true?

761
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,670
It clearly describes

762
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:14,710
how she ascended

763
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:15,760
to become a god.

764
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:17,630
The Divine Realm is not in the sky,

765
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,110
and the difference between the Divine Realm and the Mortal Realm

766
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:20,800
is not a matter of distance,

767
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:22,510
but of entirely separate worlds.

768
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:26,320
Have you heard of the Heavenly Ladder?

769
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:30,760
In the past, the Heavenly Ladder

770
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,320
was the passage between the two realms.

771
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:34,840
But now, the passage has been destroyed,

772
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:37,630
and the two worlds can no longer connect.

773
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:40,440
To travel from one realm to the other,

774
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:42,670
you must cross the Sea of Flux.

775
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:45,360
What is the Sea of Flux?

776
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:47,400
I've never heard of it before.

777
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,710
You can think of the Sea of Flux

778
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:50,710
as a barrier,

779
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:53,480
a wall that separates the heavens from the humans.

780
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,000
So,

781
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:58,710
if I can find a way

782
00:35:58,710 --> 00:35:59,760
to cross that wall,

783
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,070
I can reach the Divine Realm

784
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:02,000
and become a god?

785
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,440
Theoretically, yes.

786
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:06,320
But you shouldn't think about it.

787
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,230
It's incredibly dangerous.

788
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:10,280
Even gods,

789
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:12,110
attempting to cross the Sea of Flux,

790
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,320
face a life-or-death struggle.

791
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:15,430
Why?

792
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,550
Because it's a realm beyond the world,

793
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,360
untethered by the laws of heaven and earth.

794
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,200
How do you know so much about it?

795
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:34,960
Can you see it now?

796
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:39,360
Is it better?

797
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,190
How does it feel?

798
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:44,440
Are you alright?

799
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,710
It's fine,

800
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:51,510
just a little sting.

801
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:52,960
I've just applied the medicine.

802
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:54,960
It'll feel better in a couple of days.

803
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,800
Today, I checked your wound.

804
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,920
The others are healing well,

805
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,280
but the knife wound on your chest

806
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,400
hasn't fully healed yet.

807
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,440
I heard from Qian Lin about that knife.

808
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,670
It's called

809
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,230
the God-Slaying Dagger,

810
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,510
and it's quite sinister.

811
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,510
You need to take extra care of yourself.

812
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,320
Don't worry,

813
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,760
I have the Divine Left Hand.

814
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,330
I can heal any injury.

815
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:24,630
I'll go prepare the medicine for you now.

816
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:28,030
Thank you.

817
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:30,000
If it hadn't been for you,

818
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:32,000
I honestly don't know

819
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,070
what I would have done.

820
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:36,030
You're saying this all of a sudden.

821
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:37,760
I'm not quite used to it.

822
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,710
What's so strange about it?

823
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,670
I'm simply telling the truth.

824
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,480
I'll go prepare the medicine now.

825
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:24,520
Can you still hold on?

826
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,510
Where is Taihe's body?

827
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,240
Didn't you see it?

828
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,860
That was just an illusion from the Luofu Sea.

829
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,190
It wasn't Taihe at all.

830
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:34,920
Where exactly is Taihe?

831
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,400
Did you scheme against Tanyin,

832
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,760
causing her to lose her divine bone?

833
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,510
Shut up!

834
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,490
Don't mention her to me.

835
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,250
That good-for-nothing,

836
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:46,880
worthless girl,

837
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,260
for the sake of some man,

838
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:51,280
she not only abandoned Taihe,

839
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,120
but also neglected herself.

840
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:54,480
Tell me,

841
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,710
why has this happened?

842
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:57,510
She has practiced for so many years,

843
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:58,760
with such great talent.

844
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,880
She could have focused on her cultivation,

845
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,710
made further progress,

846
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:01,230
and lived a peaceful life,

847
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:02,880
doing what she loves,

848
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,480
enjoying longevity with the heavens, earth, and sun.

849
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,510
But instead,

850
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:06,590
she chose to become

851
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:08,280
a despised mouse,

852
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,480
chased by others,

853
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,800
burned in blazing flames,

854
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,590
hated by all!

855
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:16,280
If you truly care for her,

856
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:18,320
why did you hurt her?

857
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,150
It's not me!

858
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:20,150
I didn't hurt her!

859
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,230
It's her fault!

860
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:26,590
She's always been like this.

861
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,710
No,

862
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:31,510
I should have realized it earlier.

863
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,280
What are you trying to say?

864
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:39,400
They're all the same.

865
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,630
She can't remember

866
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:44,190
how I worked day and night for her.

867
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,960
How

868
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,840
I nearly

869
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:49,460
exhausted myself

870
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:52,400
to make her live a comfortable life,

871
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:54,400
so she could smile.

872
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:56,860
She only remembers those men,

873
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:58,290
their few words,

874
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:00,150
their empty promises,

875
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:02,480
and their appearances,

876
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,880
which,

877
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,880
in the blink of an eye,

878
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,440
were destroyed.

879
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,280
In the end,

880
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,960
they brought themselves to this pitiful state.

881
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,480
They should regret it.

882
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,360
They should all die!

883
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,070
Hannv,

884
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,190
Tanyin and Chu aren't the same person.

885
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,400
They're all the same!

886
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:23,590
They're all fools

887
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:24,840
who only get deceived by men!

888
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,760
What do you want to do?

889
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:30,960
Where exactly is Taihe?

890
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,030
What do you want to do?

891
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:54,040
Don't rush.

892
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:59,550
You'll find out soon.

893
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:01,320
Everything

894
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:03,850
will end soon.

895
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:13,360
Hannv!

896
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,240
Hannv!

897
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:25,880
The medicine today is very bitter.

898
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:27,190
I made a soup.

899
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,440
Try it.

900
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:45,360
It's a mix of sour and sweet,

901
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,030
with a hint

902
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,840
of fresh floral fragrance.

903
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:51,710
That's the pear tree flower.

904
00:41:58,370 --> 00:41:59,210
It's delicious.

905
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:06,700
Actually, the Fragrant Grove is quite nice.

941
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,470
♫The wind blows♫

942
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,260
♫It blows away the shadows of the clouds♫

943
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:00,840
I could only see a tiny patch of sky,

944
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:01,950
♫It makes the moon seem even brighter♫

945
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:02,630
no bigger than the size of my palm.

946
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:06,160
♫It makes me wake up from a dream♫

947
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:05,630
I used to think that

948
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:07,410
♫The wind blows♫

949
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,670
once I was free,

950
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:09,030
♫It reddens my eyes♫

951
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,400
I'd finally be able to truly gaze at the stars.

952
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:11,050
♫It warms the promise we made♫

953
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:14,690
♫In the wind, we gently♫

954
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:13,480
But who would have thought

955
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:15,960
it would take forty years for me to escape?

956
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:17,400
♫Drift into a better place♫

957
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:19,000
By the time I did,

958
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,030
I had already lost the desire

959
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:22,630
to admire the stars.
