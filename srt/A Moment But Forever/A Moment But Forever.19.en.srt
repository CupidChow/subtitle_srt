[A Moment But Forever]

2
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,160
[Episode 19]

3
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,870
What is this thing for?

4
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,350
This? It's an iron chisel.

5
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:55,789
How do you use it?

6
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,789
The iron chisel is used like this.

7
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:01,950
May I try it?

8
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,400
Sure.

9
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,640
Thank you.

10
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,640
It's just a piece of iron.

11
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,920
What's so interesting about it?

12
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,310
Madam.

13
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,190
Tanyin.

14
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,360
This cabinet you made is really beautiful.

15
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,520
You have very dexterous hands.

16
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:20,710
This Pei Jiu,

17
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,360
he was supposed to come and try on his wedding outfit.

18
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,130
It's already past noon, and there's still no sign of him.

19
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:26,400
I bet that muddlehead forgot again.

20
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:28,430
Qian Lin.

21
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:29,829
Do me a small favor

22
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,450
and try on the wedding outfit for Pei Jiu.

23
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,240
Me?

24
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,910
Try on the wedding outfit?

25
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,079
Yes, you.

26
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,420
You carry on, Tanyin.

27
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,300
Let's go, let's go.

28
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,400
I'll go with you.

29
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,680
It fits you quite well.

30
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:47,680
Then, won't it be

31
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,000
a bit too large for Pei Jiu?

32
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,150
Turn around and let me see.

33
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:53,530
Turn this way.

34
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,800
He's taller than Pei Jiu.

35
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,500
Then the length should be fine, right?

36
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,690
The length seems fine.

37
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,800
But if the shoulders

38
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,190
could be taken in a bit,

39
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:07,280
it would be more suitable

40
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,400
for Pei Jiu.

41
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,180
I think so too.

42
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:12,970
He looks quite good in this wedding attire.

43
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,070
Isn't he fairer than Pei Jiu?

44
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,870
Fairer?

45
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,400
I think they look about the same.

46
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,400
About the same?

47
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:24,950
Why do I feel he's much fairer?

48
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,370
Can you just focus on the outfit?

49
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,000
Stand still and don't move around.

50
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,329
Alright, that should be enough.

51
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,240
Let's leave it at that.

52
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:32,960
Wait a moment.

53
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,190
The hat.

54
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,520
I was just teasing Pei Jiu for being forgetful,

55
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,800
but mine is just as bad.

56
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,590
I forgot to bring the hat.

57
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,520
Wait here. I'll go get it.

58
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,470
In a moment!

59
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,910
How old are you?

60
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,280
"How old are you?"

61
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,030
Only children are asked such questions.

62
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,470
Aren't you just a child?

63
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,150
I bet you're not even married yet.

64
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,030
I'm not young at all.

65
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,310
At my age,

66
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,400
if I were living in my clan,

67
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,490
I'd have several children by now.

68
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:08,710
I...

69
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,740
I just wanted to wait a bit longer.

70
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:13,580
I really wouldn't have guessed

71
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,120
that you come from a big family.

72
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,560
Where is your home?

73
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,000
A place far away.

74
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,190
You don't want to say it?

75
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,160
It's okay.

76
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,800
You don't have to say if you don't want to.

77
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,040
My home is also far away.

78
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,560
Probably even farther than yours.

79
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,270
I don't want to talk about it either.

80
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,120
What exactly is your relationship

81
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,800
with that Mr. Yuan?

82
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,000
Master and servant, I suppose.

83
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,430
If,

84
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,430
I mean if,

85
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,240
if he were in danger,

86
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,360
would you be... sad and upset?

87
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,830
In danger?

88
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,050
Like what happened on the tower ship before.

89
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,390
If he were to get hurt...

90
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:19,550
If he...

91
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,430
Then...

92
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,240
then I would definitely protect him.

93
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,390
[Yesterday's Inn]

94
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,510
You're still up so late?

95
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:54,830
I'm not tired.

96
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,630
I see you've been busy all along.

97
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:58,000
Have some water.

98
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,480
It's clean. I haven't used it.

99
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,430
Thank you.

100
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,600
No, I should be the one thanking you.

101
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:06,830
You saved my life.

102
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,560
You've already thanked me many times for it.

103
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,560
Then let me thank you once more.

104
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,040
You seem... upset.

105
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,830
How can you tell

106
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:26,830
that I'm upset?

107
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,310
Earlier, I wasn't completely unconscious

108
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,630
when I was in a coma.

109
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,390
I vaguely saw you.

110
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:33,950
At that time,

111
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,630
your smile was far more genuine than it is now.

112
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,600
What's making you upset?

113
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,800
Would you like to talk about it?

114
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,270
I have a friend.

115
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,830
She has a very good male friend.

116
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,270
But for some reason,

117
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,310
he seems to be angry.

118
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,040
Even though he's clearly in the room,

119
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,390
he pretends not to be there

120
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,920
and won't let her in.

121
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,800
It seems like

122
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,340
he's deliberately avoiding her.

123
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,870
Did they... have a fight?

124
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,830
A fight?

125
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,070
No, they didn't.

126
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,600
Some people

127
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,690
are just like that.

128
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,840
Moody and ruthless.

129
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,430
They can't change.

130
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,750
It's their nature.

131
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,360
That's not true at all.

132
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,430
I think it is.

133
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:29,920
Go tell that friend of yours

134
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,870
to be careful.

135
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,470
Or maybe...

136
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,690
you should find a new friend instead.

137
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,390
Forget it. Let's not talk about it anymore.

138
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,600
You wouldn't understand anyway.

139
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,970
Where did all these chicken feathers come from?

140
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,600
Did a weasel get in?

141
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:53,800
Hello, Jiu.

142
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,510
You're sweeping, Liu.

143
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,560
What good stuff are you holding?

144
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,070
It's a secret.

145
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,480
Go away, go away.

146
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,280
Who's Liu?

147
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:06,960
Yunniang.

148
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:09,800
Why are you here?

149
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,720
Aren't you busy today?

150
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,310
Of course, I'm busy.

151
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,560
But no matter how busy I am, I have to prioritize what's important.

152
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,110
Look.

153
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:17,560
Didn't you say

154
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,750
you wanted to follow the old tradition

155
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,240
of setting off fireworks the night before the wedding?

156
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:21,940
I brought some for you.

157
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:23,950
Quick, get me a bowl of water.

158
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,160
Why make such a fuss over these few things?

159
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:29,920
Don't get me started.

160
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,480
Just now, I don't know why,

161
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:32,870
but I couldn't find

162
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,360
the way to your inn.

163
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,200
Were you going in circles?

164
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,120
No.

165
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:41,909
I was just wandering around,

166
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:43,080
unable to remember how to get here.

167
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,720
Lately,

168
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,240
things have been quite strange for me.

169
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,390
I can't sleep well at night,

170
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:48,300
and when I do sleep,

171
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,610
I keep having lots of dreams.

172
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,270
They feel like they're about someone else's life

173
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,070
or maybe from my past life.

174
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,120
But when I wake up, I can't remember any of it.

175
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,720
I've been worried about forgetting things lately.

176
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:58,720
Look.

177
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,000
Now, I write everything

178
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,550
down in this little notebook.

179
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:02,940
Look.

180
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:04,480
The last one.

181
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,480
"Sending fireworks to Yunniang."

182
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,390
If it weren't for this note,

183
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,390
I'm afraid I would have forgotten about this entirely.

184
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:15,390
Oh, right.

185
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,790
Yunniang,

186
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,160
take a look at it and see if you like it.

187
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,600
Such a precious thing.

188
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:32,790
Where did you get it?

189
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:33,600
Well, I

190
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,720
saved money for a long time

191
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:37,340
to buy

192
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,270
the only pearl necklace in town.

193
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:45,670
And this.

194
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:48,270
We're getting married the day after tomorrow.

195
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:49,890
I'll leave this little notebook

196
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,630
with you for safekeeping.

197
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:53,240
It's now like

198
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,360
half my life to me.

199
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,750
I'm afraid

200
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,960
I might forget it too in the future.

201
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,480
I'll feel at ease leaving it with you.

202
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,150
You're not afraid of forgetting me too, huh?

203
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,030
What are you talking about?

204
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,440
Even if I forget myself,

205
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,550
I could never forget you.

206
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,030
Greetings, Young Mistress.

207
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,200
How is his injury?

208
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:21,630
Not good.

209
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,200
Has he regained consciousness?

210
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,750
Tanghua?

211
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,270
Tanghua.

212
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,330
♫I gaze into your deep eyes♫

213
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:29,590
♫For whom do you take apart the word "love"?♫

214
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:35,080
♫Turning around, it's like a dream♫

215
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,150
Let me do it.

216
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:41,290
♫I have betrayed deep love♫

217
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,570
Go fetch a plum candy.

218
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:47,430
♫Heaving a long, helpless sigh♫

219
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:44,910
Mr. Tanghua

220
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,510
can't even swallow medicine right now.

221
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,080
How could he possibly eat candy?

222
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:52,170
♫Time flies too rapidly♫

223
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,000
It's for me.

224
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,480
Yes, Young Mistress.

225
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:58,120
♫Life is like a flying bird♫

226
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:03,600
♫Joining, scattering, no way back♫

227
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:07,850
♫Unable to get what I yearn for, I sink in sadness♫

228
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:14,210
♫When I brush past love, fate is set♫

229
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:17,610
♫I've used up my brush and ink♫

230
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:21,110
♫I couldn't describe♫

231
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,490
♫This lovesick path♫

232
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,910
Yunniang, why are you here?

233
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,440
Are you here to check on the furniture?

234
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:31,870
Not at all.

235
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,270
I trust your craftsmanship.

236
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,030
Then why are you here?

237
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,270
I'm here to drop this off.

238
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:39,960
What's wrong with it?

239
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,200
Originally, we only needed one box of fireworks.

240
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,270
But Pei Jiu actually forgot

241
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:45,360
that he had already sent one two days ago

242
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,420
and sent another box today.

243
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,630
Pei Jiu is not himself today.

244
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,480
His memory shouldn't be this poor.

245
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,750
Is he... is he sick?

246
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,120
At first, I thought so too.

247
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,510
But after thinking it over,

248
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,710
that doesn't seem to be the case.

249
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,240
This memory problem of his

250
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,750
seems to have started when he began learning martial arts

251
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,910
from your young master.

252
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,870
Tanyin, I don't think of you as an outsider.

253
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:08,760
I won't beat around the bush.

254
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,440
Could you ask your young master

255
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:11,550
if Pei Jiu's condition

256
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,550
has anything to do with learning martial arts?

257
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,150
I'm really worried about him.

258
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:23,870
Do you think

259
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,510
once Pei Jiu regains his memories,

260
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,080
his personally will completely change?

261
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:28,750
I wonder if the proprietress

262
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,440
will still like him.

263
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,790
Can they

264
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,240
still be together happily?

265
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:34,750
Recently,

266
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,030
my memory has been poor.

267
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:37,940
Look at my brain.

268
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,320
When I went to the government office today,

269
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,760
I couldn't even remember what the magistrate looked like.

270
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,320
The town hasn't been peaceful lately.

271
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,320
Near the abandoned temple,

272
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:31,960
several young beggars have gone missing.

273
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:13,110
[Yesterday's Inn]

274
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,030
Master,

275
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:45,360
why do I always feel that something is missing

276
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,600
when I use my spiritual power

277
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,320
to break through my Spirit Courtyard?

278
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,120
Did you...

279
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,240
What do you want to say?

280
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:56,480
Hold something back?

281
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:58,750
When we first started teaching you,

282
00:16:58,750 --> 00:16:59,960
you acted like we were trying to harm you.

283
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,200
Now, you want to learn more.

284
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:02,630
I've taught you all the techniques

285
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:04,160
that I needed to teach you.

286
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,640
The last step—breaking through your Spirit Courtyard—

287
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,240
is something you must do on your own.

288
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:08,829
I can't help you with this.

289
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,510
Fine, I'll do it myself.

290
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,030
What's the big deal?

291
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:20,160
That's enough for today.

292
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,200
You can go back now.

293
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:21,920
Kai Shan!

294
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:23,460
Master.

295
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,069
I've noticed recently

296
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:28,109
that my memory has become very poor.

297
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:29,070
I keep forgetting things.

298
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,290
Do you think it might have something to do

299
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,800
with the technique I've been practicing?

300
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,070
If I keep practicing like this,

301
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,110
will there be any problems?

302
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:54,830
Yuanzhong.

303
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,240
What are you doing here?

304
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,660
Recently, Pei Jiu

305
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:07,010
has suddenly become very forgetful.

306
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:07,870
He seems to have forgotten

307
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,370
many people and things from his past.

308
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:10,160
Does this have something

309
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,000
to do with the technique

310
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,960
you taught him?

311
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,460
-Let's talk over there.
-Don't go!

312
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,400
This concerns his future.

313
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,720
Why can't he listen?

314
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:23,830
What do you want to say?

315
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:24,440
If Pei Jiu

316
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,720
continues like this,

317
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,310
will he forget

318
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:28,880
everything about Pei Jiu

319
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,790
and regain his memories as Lu Chen?

320
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,920
By then, Pei Jiu will no longer be Pei Jiu

321
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:34,510
but will have become Lu Chen, right?

322
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,480
Who is Lu Chen?

323
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,640
Why would I no longer be myself?

324
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:02,160
Chief, we've brought back two more.

325
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,370
It's almost time.

326
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:07,910
It's almost time.

327
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:12,070
Beautiful.

328
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:15,160
You're such a good boy.

329
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:17,640
So scared, yet still so good.

330
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,200
Good, good, good.

331
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,720
You guessed right.

332
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,350
He will indeed forget

333
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,400
everything about now,

334
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,640
become Lu Chen again,

335
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,750
and leave this place with me.

336
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:31,310
M-Master.

337
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,440
What do you mean by that?

338
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,070
It means

339
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:38,880
you are not Pei Jiu

340
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,110
but Lu Chen.

341
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:42,200
I'm helping you find your true self.

342
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,400
What about Yunniang?

343
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,720
She has been waiting for so long

344
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,400
just to marry Pei Jiu.

345
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,030
She has even prepared her wedding attire.

346
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:50,960
In two more days,

347
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,200
she will get married.

348
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,790
And now, you're making Pei Jiu forget Yunniang

349
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:54,680
and everything.

350
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,160
How is this any different from killing him?

351
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:57,640
For him, this place is

352
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,550
nothing but a grand dream.

353
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:00,750
When the dream ends,

354
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:03,240
he should return to who he truly is.

355
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,310
This is not a dream.

356
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:05,110
So what?

357
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,310
You should at least give him

358
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:07,480
the right to choose.

359
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:22,790
Who do you think you are?

360
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:26,070
What right do you have to interfere in my affairs?

361
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:27,880
I don't think this is

362
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,000
just your affair.

363
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,350
It's also about Pei Jiu and Yunniang's

364
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:31,440
lifelong happiness.

365
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,790
How kind of you to care so much for them.

366
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:35,510
I'm kind to everyone.

367
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,110
You know that.

368
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:40,480
Sometimes,

369
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:42,630
excessive kindness

370
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,420
is its own form of cruelty.

371
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,440
Do... do you...

372
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,830
do you know something?

373
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:55,400
You didn't hide it very well.

374
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,200
I wasn't trying to hide from you.

375
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,400
It's just that earlier I...

376
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:01,830
These past few days,

377
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:03,110
I've been thinking about one thing.

378
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,110
Why did you

379
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,310
come to my side?

380
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,720
Is it also because of this?

381
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,440
You also want to kill me

382
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,480
and then take it?

383
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,310
I don't.

384
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:16,440
I never wanted to harm you.

385
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,400
Then what do you want?

386
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,270
To change me? Influence me?

387
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,400
To make me become like you

388
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,920
to save all living beings and spare the War Demons?

389
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,960
You're overthinking it!

390
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,350
I just want to...

391
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,510
I don't care what you want.

392
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:26,000
It doesn't matter to me.

393
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,380
Ji Tanyin.

394
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,310
Perhaps I should

395
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,750
call you the Mute Lady of Wu Mountain.

396
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:34,110
I'm curious about one thing.

397
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,210
Would someone who has lived for over a thousand years

398
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,000
still consider

399
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,440
themselves human?

400
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:40,000
Or do they believe they've

401
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,720
already ascended to immortality,

402
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,960
transcended all living beings,

403
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:44,440
and become a god?

404
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,160
You and I have different positions.

405
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:50,890
I have no right to criticize you for anything.

406
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,830
But likewise,

407
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:53,510
don't try to influence me

408
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,480
or change me!

409
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:56,110
You've never been in my position,

410
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:58,000
seen what I've seen, and felt what I've felt,

411
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:58,880
so naturally, you won't understand

412
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,270
why I do what I do.

413
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,640
I know exactly

414
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,270
what I want

415
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:05,520
and what I'm doing.

416
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:06,840
No one

417
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,030
can change my decision...

418
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,830
not even

419
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,680
a god.

420
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:18,160
Very well. Very well.

421
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:20,000
Very well. Very well.

422
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:26,000
Why not draw blood from the forehead?

423
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,790
The children of the human race

424
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:30,470
don't have as much power

425
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:32,790
in their blood as we do.

426
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:36,620
Taking blood from the forehead won't work.

427
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,200
Come on.

428
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,380
Come on, come on.

429
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:07,110
Ji Tanyin.

430
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,880
Give up.

431
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,750
You can't influence me,

432
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,590
much less change me.

433
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,510
I am not a good person.

434
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:17,030
The path I walk

435
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,750
is also completely different from yours.

436
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:20,480
Let's part ways forever

437
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:22,200
and leave each other alone.

438
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:23,900
It's good

439
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:25,310
for you

440
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,350
and for me.

441
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:52,880
Miss... Miss Ji?

442
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:16,370
Possessing technique.

443
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:17,320
Die!

444
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,400
Ghost Ancestor of Darkness, Fallen Ruler of Tombs.

445
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,200
With the blood of battles, I command the spirits of war.

446
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,200
Take my body, seize my soul.

447
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,270
With my hatred as your blade, strike down my foes.

448
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:03,080
Restrain her!

449
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:27,840
Wake up!

450
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,030
Take my body, seize my soul.

451
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:39,220
With my hatred as your blade, strike down my foes.

452
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,950
With my hatred as your blade, strike down my foes.

453
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,670
We can't hold back anymore!

454
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:08,210
Zi Fei, stop!

455
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,510
You're the War Demon from the tower ship?

456
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,200
That's right. It's me!

457
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:51,930
Yuanzhong!

458
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,330
I can't believe they failed.

459
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:15,690
I told you long ago.

460
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:18,000
If they were truly capable,

461
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,070
they wouldn't have ended up

462
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,480
in this sorry state.

463
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:22,030
The stupidity of the War Demons

464
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,680
is beyond redemption.

465
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,310
You'd better say something useful.

466
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,070
Something useful?

467
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:31,920
That little goddess

468
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,550
is no longer under your control.

469
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,750
You've practically

470
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:36,510
sent Yuanzhong a helper.

471
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,680
No matter what you want to do,

472
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:40,240
as long as she's around,

473
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,160
everything will be twice as difficult.

474
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:43,640
So,

475
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,230
kill her.

476
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,160
Eliminate Ji Tanyin

477
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,350
or hand her over to me.

478
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,680
Hannv, how dare you!

479
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,250
I dare to do even more.

480
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,280
Would you like to try it?

481
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,550
Who are these people?

482
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,720
And who are you?

483
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,460
What's going on here?

484
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,830
It's a long story.

485
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:18,350
Then tell me from the beginning.

486
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:22,030
Come on, tell me!

488
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,240
Something terrible has happened!

489
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:27,330
Madam is missing.

490
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,880
Missing?

491
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,350
I just got up to use the bathroom

492
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:31,200
and saw her room door wide open.

493
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,030
I went in to check

494
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:33,110
and found this.

495
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:34,750
"I'm going after the thief.

496
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,110
If I can't return in time,

00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:37,310
quickly inform Pei Jiu."

498
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:38,350
When did she leave?

499
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,680
I don't know.

What's this?

503
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:55,400
It's one of the pearls from the necklace

504
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,240
I just gave to Yunniang.

505
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,070
Then she must be

506
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,240
dropping these as a clue for us.

507
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:58,960

How is it?

510
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:20,470
The High Priest of the Youhu Clan is coming after us.

511
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:22,160
We should go. Help here.

512

Let's go.

Gushan?

514
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,270
I was thinking of making an embroidery piece

515
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:47,790
as your birthday gift.

516
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:49,940
I need your birth date and time for that.

517
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,540
Why don't you write it down for me?

518
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,030
It seems

519
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:56,680
that it's Hannv

520
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,680
who leaked my birth date and name

521
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,400
to the War Demons.

522
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,720
She wanted to use the War Demons and me

to kill Yuanzhong.

524
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,880
It's only been a few miles of mountain road,

b-but why is it so cold up here?

526
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,070
Gushan is covered in snow all year round.

Where's that woman?

Chief, someone is trespassing on the mountain.

we have attained the mind of dharma.

00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:39,910
killing is also a form of good.

566
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,550
What a price to pay.

567
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:43,830
What a form of good.

568
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,720
May I ask, who is the snake

569
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:47,050
you are referring to?

570
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,960
The person we want to kill.

571
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,220
That's right, that's right.

572
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:52,030
That person is

573
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:53,830
the biggest venomous snake under heaven.

574
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:53,730
[Elder Bei He; War Demon]

575
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,110
Sixty years ago,

576
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:57,940
this fiend almost wiped out our entire clan.

577
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:59,640
Half of our Twelve War Generals

578
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:02,070
also fell by his hand.

579
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:03,640
Twelve halved leaves six,

580
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:05,430
but there are only three of you.

581
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:07,610
This is precisely his cruelty.

582
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:10,790
He allowed his Youhu Clan to reign supreme,

583
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:13,690
making our clan hunted by everyone in the mortal realm.

584
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,790
We had no choice

585
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:17,920
but to hide in this desolate mountain.

586
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,680
For 60 years,

587
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,720
we were powerless to seek revenge.

588
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,850
We could only sit in meditation,

589
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,680
waiting for our lives to fade away.

590
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,830
The years of meditation have flown by.

591
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:30,830
Of the six brothers from back then,

592
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,960
now only

593
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,590
we three old fools remain.

594
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:36,260
Time has grayed our hair

595
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:38,510
and withered our flesh.

596
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:42,310
But the one thing that has never changed is our hatred for him.

597
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:43,590
That's right.

598
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,000
All these years,

599
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,960
it's been the deep-seated hatred for that fiend

600
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,440
that has kept us three alive.

601
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:53,520
Hearing that the Chief wanted to deal with that person,

602
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,350
we are here to guard the mountain

603
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,270
and protect her

604
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,920
in case he becomes desperate

605
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:03,200
and comes seeking revenge.

606
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,240
Understood.

607
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:06,790
Since you understand,

608
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:08,510
why not turn back?

609
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:09,790
The person you want to kill

610
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:10,880
will not come.

611
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:11,830
Why is that?

612
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,830
He's a snake that has long grown weary of life.

613
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,240
Your insignificant lives

614
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,920
won't startle him from his hibernation.

615
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,430
But your wait will not be in vain.

616
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,000
The debt he owes,

617
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:24,030
I'll repay.

618
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:25,160
Who are you?

619
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:26,790
I'm the one who wants him alive.

620
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,510
Yuanzhong.

621
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,110
They've brought quite the crowd.

622
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:48,550
It's not surprising.

623
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,000
After all, we've reached

624
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,160
the territory of Gushan.

625
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,680
The possessing technique that Ji Tanyin fell victim to

626
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,200
must be their doing as well.

627
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,270
Impressive.

628
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,920
Even I couldn't figure out

629
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,160
Ji Tanyin's background,

630
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:00,790
yet they already know.

631
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:01,960
So what should we do now?

632
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:02,880
What to do?

633
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:05,110
If they have gotten a death wish,

634
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,270
then I might as well grant it to them.

635
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:19,580
If you want to kill us,

636
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,000
just do it.

637
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:22,389
Do you really want to die that much?

638
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:24,670
Can the abyss of resentment carved open by killing

639
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:27,230
ever be filled by more killing?

640
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,500
It seems you truly don't understand.

641
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:33,340
As expected, your sixty years of cultivation have been wasted.

642
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:35,030
Let's go.

643
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,230
Don't go.

644
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:38,650
Don't go. Kill me.

645
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:40,630
Your sword is right beside you.

646
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:42,110
If you truly have no will to live,

647
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:43,360
you can end it yourself.

648
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,560
But don't blame your death

649
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:47,239
on others.

650
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,800
Using your lives to fish for fame and honor

651
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:52,920
is truly despicable.

652
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,000
Chief,

653
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:07,880
it's a man and a woman.

654
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,880
Their blades are very sharp.

655
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,230
Elder Ku Sheng and the other two were no match.

656
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,400
Activate the mountain protection formation.

657
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:16,360
Since they dare to come,

658
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,510
we should make sure they never leave.

659
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:19,800
Yes.

660
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,670
What's that?

661
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,840
It's the War Demon's mountain protection formation.

662
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:31,760
It seems the War Demons

663
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,110
have indeed abducted many children of the human race

664
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:34,190
and brought them up here.

665
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,320
Yunniang must have found out

666
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,070
their whereabouts,

667
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:37,280
and that's why she followed.

668
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,190
Let's split up.

669
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,360
I'll go break the formation

670
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:41,670
to divert their attention.

671
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,920
You go find Yunniang.

672
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:43,580
Okay.

673
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,070
But remember:

674
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,440
no matter what dangers you encounter,

675
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,440
don't fight hard.

676
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,840
If Yuanzhong returns

677
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,030
and finds we're not there,

678
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:51,290
he will surely come for us.

679
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,190
Once he arrives,

680
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:53,670
everything will change for the better.

681
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:54,750
Miss Ji,

682
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,150
was everything you and my master said

683
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,190
last night true?

684
00:35:58,710 --> 00:35:59,710
If I continue

685
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:01,670
practicing that technique,

686
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:03,230
I'll forget myself

687
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:04,840
and become someone else entirely?

688
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,550
Yes.

689
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:08,550
But Pei Jiu,

690
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,590
Lu Chen is Yuanzhong's friend.

691
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:12,150
They're friends for life who have been through

692
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:13,190
thick and thin together.

693
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:15,240
If you were gone,

694
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,760
Yunniang would be heartbroken,

695
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,840
and so would I,

696
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:18,960
because we only know

697
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,920
the current you.

698
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:21,440
But looking at it from their angle,

699
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,320
if Yuanzhong lost his friend,

700
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:25,880
he would be just as upset.

701
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:27,920
In this matter,

702
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:29,670
everyone has their own stance.

703
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:31,000
There's no right or wrong.

704
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,840
You only need to remember one thing:

705
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:34,550
whether you're Pei Jiu

706
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:36,110
or Lu Chen,

707
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,710
you're not alone.

708
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:39,960
We all care about you.

709
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,880
I understand.

710
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:45,870
Thank you, Miss Ji.

711
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:48,320
Let's go.

712
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,510
How did you get here so quickly?

713
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,590
Any slower,

714
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:15,440
and you'd have become wolf chow.

715
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,880
Don't underestimate me.

716
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,490
Why are there so many vicious wolves?

717
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:23,060
Where there are vicious wolves, there must be a vicious master.

718
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:30,640
The High Priest of the Youhu Clan has personally arrived.

719
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,880
What an impressive display of skill.

720
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:35,480
Indeed, the vicious master has appeared.

721
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:39,110
Who is she?

722
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:41,230
The new chief of the War Demon,

723
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,200
Li Chaoyang.

724
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:43,840
Surname Li?

725
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:46,850
What's your relation to Li Changtian?

726
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,220
He was my father.

727
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:51,860
I see.

728
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:53,840
If we're speaking in those terms,

729
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:56,200
she should call you uncle.

730
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:57,020
How dare you!

731
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:10,440
Yuanzhong.

732
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,880
You are the sworn enemy of our clan

733
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,280
and the lifelong hatred of my father.

734
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:18,750
Today, if I take your life,

735
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,400
it'll be heaven's justice.

736
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:22,510
With just you?

737
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:24,630
And these few rabid dogs of yours?

738
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:27,400
I'm afraid you're the only one who'll be meeting your maker.

739
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,530
Such arrogance.

740
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:11,120
This won't do.

741
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:12,470
We must find a way to break their formation.

742
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:21,480
That move is not bad.

743
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,590
And then?

744
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:23,960
Then?

745
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:26,630
Wait for me to gather my strength and break out.

746
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,480
Little one?

747
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:32,630
Little one?

748
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,590
Can you hear me?

749
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,150
What's wrong with you?

750
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:38,550
I know you heard me.

751
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:39,400
What happened?

752
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,070
This is not up to you.

753
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:43,140
Come and meet me.

754
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,550
Yuanzhong?

755
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:47,360
Don't move.

756
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,800
He seems to be in a meditative trance.

757
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,670
Meditative trance?

758
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:52,910
With an enemy at the gates, he meditates?

759
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:54,440
This wasn't his choice.

760
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,960
Something's off here.

761
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:57,070
I'm going to check.

762
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:57,960
Check?

763
00:40:58,390 --> 00:40:59,200
How?

764
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:00,960
This barrier should be able to be

765
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,030
reinforced with magical power.

766
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:03,080
You stand guard.

767
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,000
Yuanzhong?

768
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:40,710
You're injured.

769
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:42,670
Injured, yes.

770
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:44,670
But I'm not the person you're looking for.

771
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:46,840
You're not Yuanzhong.

772
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,690
Yes and no.

773
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:50,450
This is Yuanzhong's Cave of Spiritual Consciousness,

774
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,110
and I am the essence of his spiritual consciousness.

775
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:55,630
You're the essence of his spiritual consciousness?

776
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:58,220
Then... why are you injured?

777
00:41:58,250 --> 00:41:59,000
Demon Dragon.

778
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,150
Demon Dragon?

779
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:02,310
During the war between gods and demons,

780
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:04,300
the Demon God had a demon dragon as his mount.

781
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:05,870
When the Demon God was defeated,

782
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:07,880
his demon dragon also fell to the mortal realm.

783
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:09,670
Although its physical body was destroyed,

784
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:10,670
its spiritual consciousness

785
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:12,510
fell into a slumber in Orange Lake.

786
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,800
It might have never seen the light of day again.

787
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,630
However, Lu Chen's arrival

788
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:17,880
awakened it.

789
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:19,110
It then took the opportunity

790
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:20,920
and entered Lu Chen's body.

791
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,400
This was also the reason

792
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,320
why Lu Chen was severely injured and lost his memory in the first place.

793
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,510
So that's what happened.

794
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,960
Later, when Yuanzhong was teaching Lu Chen,

795
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:30,190
the Demon Dragon thought

796
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:31,280
that Yuanzhong would be an even better

797
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,320
vessel to possess.

798
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:35,030
So it transformed into a wisp of demonic energy

799
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:36,070
and entered Yuanzhong's

800
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:37,070
sea of consciousness.

801
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:38,840
I fought against it for days,

802
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:39,880
but in the end, I was no match for it.

803
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:41,360
It severely wounded me

804
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:42,760
and then entered the cave.

805
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,630
The Demon Dragon entered

806
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:46,480
Yuanzhong's Cave of Spiritual Consciousness?
