[A Moment But Forever]

2
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:47,280
[Episode 5]

3
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:10,830
What are you doing?

4
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,470
I... I'm pulling up the sheet for you.

5
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:18,350
I don't want you to catch a cold.

6
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,400
Go back to sleep then.

7
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:21,310
Get out.

8
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:23,310
Okay.

9
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:29,350
Close the door.

10
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,340
Last night, extra guards

11
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,390
were deployed to protect Tianqu Peak.

12
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,470
It is said that something went missing.

13
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,710
What a surprise to know someone would actually

14
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,110
covet Dingxu's worthless bottles and pots.

15
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:01,910
We don't care about those,

16
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,350
but many others do.

17
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:04,510
Countless people would go to Tianqu Peak

18
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:05,150
in quest of medicine

19
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,110
every year.

20
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:06,830
They all want to prolong

21
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:07,870
their lives or live forever, don't they?

22
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,120
His days are numbered.

23
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:11,710
How can he assure someone of an immortal life?

24
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,190
We're alone in here.

25
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,590
We don't have to pretend every day, do we?

26
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,790
It's not just about deceit.

27
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:21,190
There's great wisdom hidden in this.

28
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,950
Keep studying in seclusion till the right moment comes.

29
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,750
I don't understand.

30
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:29,390
The human race

31
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,110
is not half bad.

32
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,350
If their lifespan were longer

33
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,860
and their strength bigger,

34
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,610
the immortal race would be out of the picture, right?

35
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:38,470
Are humans really that good?

36
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,510
Don't strain yourself.

37
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,750
It takes intelligence to study this stuff.

38
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,700
You won't be able to figure it out.

39
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,150
What's wrong? Did you not sleep well last night?

40
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:56,390
I don't know what got into

41
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:57,270
Tan Jiyin.

42
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,150
She came to my room in the middle of the night.

43
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:00,710
So I had to stay on guard against her all night.

44
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:02,070
Then what happened?

45
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:04,190
She never returned.

46
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,110
You felt a bit

47
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,190
disappointed, didn't you?

48
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,590
If you're really sleepy,

49
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,750
then take a bath and have a nap.

50
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:13,950
I'm sure you'll sleep better this time.

51
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,250
This tiny lock clasp alone

52
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,550
can't possibly control

53
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:26,750
the entire golden hoop.

54
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,790
Plus, each lock piece

55
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,270
contains several variations.

56
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,420
How did they get it done?

57
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,270
Did I not get

58
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,750
a good enough look last night

59
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,830
so I missed out some important details?

60
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,270
Ji Tanyin...

61
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:42,950
Ji Tanyin.

62
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,710
I... I...

63
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,550
I didn't see anything.

64
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:02,180
Tell me, what exactly do you want?

65
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,350
Nothing.

66
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,950
I just want to figure out

67
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:06,630
how to remove

68
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:07,980
the golden hoop from your neck.

69
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,310
This golden hoop

70
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,470
can't help you with your cultivation,

71
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:14,230
and it doesn't look good at all.

72
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:16,150
If you really want a neck ring,

73
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,390
I can make you

74
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,750
a new one that can be

75
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:19,550
taken off anytime.

76
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,350
I have excellent crafting skills.

77
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:22,030
I'm sure I can make

78
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:23,510
a better-looking ring than this.

79
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:26,380
Is that all you have in mind?

80
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,480
An inch of immortal gold weighs 500 kilograms.

81
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,750
This hoop sits on your neck all day long.

82
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,790
I bet it's tiring you out.

83
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:32,790
Not long ago,

84
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,909
the friction even hurt your neck.

85
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,740
The sooner I take it off of you,

86
00:06:36,909 --> 00:06:38,470
the less you will suffer.

87
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:39,870
When it's removed,

88
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,310
you can go wherever you want

89
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,990
instead of being stuck here.

90
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,830
You could've told me this in the beginning.

91
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,070
I wanted to wait

92
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,140
till I found out how to unclasp the hoop,

93
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:50,830
so I could give you a surprise.

94
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,240
Don't waste your efforts on it.

95
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:55,430
Why?

96
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,150
Come and tie my hair.

97
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,550
Don't you want a closer look at the golden hoop?

98
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,150
Why not do it now?

99
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:22,910
May I?

100
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:42,909
The craftsman who made this golden hoop

101
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:43,790
must be good.

102
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:44,940
First, he used

103
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,220
the fold forming technique

104
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:47,670
to remove as many impurities

105
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:49,270
in the immortal gold as possible.

106
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,750
Then, he used the cold forging technique

107
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,830
to improve the metal's hardness and ductility.

108
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,670
Each lock piece

109
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,909
has triple usage.

110
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:58,390
It's part of the lock,

111
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,480
part of the hoop,

112
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:01,950
and also part of...

113
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,230
A trap!

114
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:06,310
That's vicious.

115
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,820
If we mess with the wrong lock piece,

116
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,190
the trap will be activated,

117
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,110
leaving no room for error.

118
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:25,310
The hoop also contains poison.

119
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:27,430
How insidious.

120
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,870
That lock clasp is of key importance.

121
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:31,510
The lock works in three ways.

122
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:32,980
It serves as a trap

123
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,830
that is laid out on the entire golden hoop.

124
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:36,190
It is also a restraint

125
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:38,030
that limits your range of motion.

126
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:40,150
This is odd.

127
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,070
What else is involved?

128
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:44,310
Magic.

129
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,070
This golden hoop

130
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:47,470
was made by the top

131
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:48,950
108 craftsmen of the human race,

132
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:50,550
together with the nearly one thousand artisans

133
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:51,550
they led.

134
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:53,870
It is a combination

135
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,480
of the human race's best craftsmanship

136
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:56,950
and the immortal race's

137
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,710
most advanced magic of five elements.

138
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,510
So, it takes more than crafting skills

139
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,150
to unclasp the hoop.

140
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:06,990
You want to quit now?

141
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:09,910
I will definitely figure out a solution.

142
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:13,670
Go on to tie my hair.

143
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,270
You're bad at this.

144
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,550
My hair looks terrible.

145
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,790
The real problem lies in your ugly face.

146
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:28,990
Ji Tanyin,

147
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,030
you'd better be honest.

148
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,830
You are truly a plain-looking man.

149
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,140
The cherries you brought me that day

150
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:39,950
were delicious.

151
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:41,390
Do you have any more?

152
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,190
Yes, I do.

153
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:43,430
Just give me a second.

154
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,030
So soon?

155
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,030
Yeah.

156
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:59,630
I've washed them for you.

157
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:23,750
Look at them.

158
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:25,270
Does it look like they're cursing?

159
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:26,390
I don't know.

160
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:28,470
They've been following me

161
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:29,750
since I left Xiaoxiang Peak.

162
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,430
How come?

163
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,670
You like cherries, don't you?

164
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,630
Several cherry trees on Xiaoxiang Peak

165
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:38,630
have started bearing fruit lately.

166
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:40,120
But every day, the cherries that ripen,

167
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,630
turn red and grow big

168
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:43,430
tend to be pecked by birds.

169
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,560
So, when a new day starts,

170
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:46,310
I would wait under the trees before dawn

171
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:47,230
till the cherries ripen

172
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,510
for me to pick them.

173
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:52,350
But the birds seem a bit angry.

174
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,990
That's why they've been tagging along.

175
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,230
What are you laughing at?

176
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:59,870
They're cursing at you.

177
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:01,870
You know what they're saying?

178
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:02,870
No.

179
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:04,190
But all the cursing words

180
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,310
in the world

181
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:06,850
sound similar in tone.

182
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,480
Don't you want some cherries?

183
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,470
Ji Tanyin,

184
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:38,630
where are you from?

185
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:39,870
Why did you come to Fangwai Mountain?

186
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:42,990
Didn't you agree

187
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:44,300
not to ask that question?

188
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,550
Why are you asking it again?

189
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:46,910
I'm just taking a shot.

190
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:48,350
You refused to answer it yesterday.

191
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:50,110
Maybe you've had a change of mind today.

192
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,590
Things change as time goes by.

193
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:52,750
Nothing

194
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:53,870
can remain the same.

195
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,070
I came here for two reasons.

196
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,350
I can only tell you

197
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:59,230
one of them.

198
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:00,870
I'm all ears.

199
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,350
I came here to look for someone.

200
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,430
And then?

201
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:08,950
You should be asking,

202
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:10,390
"Who are you looking for?"

203
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:13,670
Well, who are you looking for?

204
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:17,670
I guess I can call him a friend of mine.

205
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:19,710
A long time ago,

206
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,310
for some reasons,

207
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:22,940
I was in agony

208
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:24,990
and I slept for a long time.

209
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:26,710
It was he who woke me up.

210
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:28,950
What happened after that?

211
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:30,390
I just left.

212
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,470
But we promised each other

213
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:33,510
that we would meet up again.

214
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:35,710
However, after that,

215
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:38,070
he never spoke to me again.

216
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,670
You already left that place.

217
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:41,150
How was he supposed to talk to you?

218
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,660
He could've transmitted his voice over distances.

219
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,230
Perhaps

220
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:46,070
your plain looks were

221
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,190
not to his liking,

222
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:47,990
so he lost

223
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:49,150
interest in talking to you.

224
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,030
That's not true.

225
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,230
He would never do such a thing.

226
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:54,830
He must have encountered

227
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:55,790
some difficulties

228
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,190
and felt hurt.

229
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,990
I bet he was too frustrated and upset

230
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:01,430
to even have the strength

231
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:02,310
to talk to people.

232
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,070
But it was really strange.

233
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,390
Why didn't he

234
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,430
turn to me for help?

235
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,390
You're just a mortal.

236
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:11,470
What help could you possibly offer him?

237
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:13,790
You wouldn't understand.

238
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,030
But it doesn't matter.

239
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:17,830
Now that I'm here,

240
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,790
everything will be fine.

241
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:36,900
Look!

242
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:39,030
Two flowers have blossomed in the pond.

243
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,390
The wind brought them there.

244
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:42,990
They're not growing in the pond.

245
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:44,670
They're so beautiful.

246
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,910
Alright, you stay here.

247
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:24,910
I'm going back.

248
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:46,150
But one day,

249
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,670
a voice suddenly came to my ears.

250
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,030
Who are you?

251
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:52,910
Are you a god?

252
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,830
Only half of the god's image

253
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:06,630
on this plaque is left.

254
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:08,910
I don't know who you are,

255
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,590
or the correct way to worship you.

256
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:13,670
God,

257
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,790
can you hear my voice?

258
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,310
God,

259
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,240
it takes twelve days to walk

260
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,630
from Dayuan to Pingzhou.

261
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,630
My dad and I rode on the Soaring Phoenix

262
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:24,790
and arrived there in just two days.

263
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:25,910
Isn't that amazing?

264
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:32,390
God,

265
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:34,470
I want to grow up soon,

266
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:36,830
so I can protect my family.

267
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:39,110
God,

268
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:40,480
it is snowing in Fangwai Mountain.

269
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,430
So beautiful.

270
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:42,990
Would you come

271
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:44,190
and watch it with me?

272
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:54,710
Yuanzhong!

273
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:56,550
What are you doing?

274
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:58,110
I'm worshiping a god.

275
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,350
As Elder Xinyao said,

276
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:02,110
one must be earnest when worshiping gods.

277
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:04,780
If I say prayers a thousand times in my heart,

278
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,740
[Youhu Clan]
[Young Yuanzhong]

279
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:06,590
a god will show up.

280
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:07,990
You believe that?

281
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:08,700
[Youhu Clan]
[Young Tanghua]

282
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,550
If you don't, just leave.

283
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:20,830
You go on with it then.

284
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,340
I'm leaving.

285
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,110
996.

286
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,790
997.

287
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:37,230
998.

288
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:39,630
999.

289
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:41,320
1,000.

290
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:14,750
Yuanzhong,

291
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,710
I did visit you

292
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:17,660
in the form of a god.

293
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:19,750
Do you remember?

294
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:26,390
It's time you took medicine.

295
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,870
I'll boil some water.

296
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:31,310
Where is Ji Tanyin?

297
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:32,650
I don't know.

298
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,980
I haven't seen her for a few days again.

299
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:45,470
Magic...

300
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,500
Judging on what you said,

301
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,950
there might be a solution.

302
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:52,460
There is a kind of magic in the Divine Realm

303
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,910
that allows one to change

304
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:55,070
one's physical form as one pleases.

305
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:57,150
Suppose Yuanzhong masters this skill

306
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,000
and shrinks himself,

307
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,630
he can then be free from constraint

308
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:02,110
and therefore lift

309
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,430
the golden hoop's restrictions.

310
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,300
Who should we learn

311
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:06,620
this trick from?

312
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,710
It must be Deity Sanxing!

313
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:10,550
Where is he?

314
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,270
Xuanqing Sea, of course!

315
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,250
Is he in deep slumber?

316
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,830
What about his disciples?

317
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,430
They all perished in the war

318
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:26,310
between gods and demons.

319
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,750
How could I

320
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:34,740
forget about this?

321
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,830
The demon clan has a trick,

322
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:40,480
to which I happen to

323
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,070
know the key.

324
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:44,670
Please tell me about it, Mr. Loong.

325
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,590
It takes 300 to 500 years of cultivation

326
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:00,590
to make a small achievement?

327
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,790
That's already considered fast.

328
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,870
But Yuanzhong can't wait that long.

329
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:07,630
It's true that members of Youhu Clan

330
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:08,710
have a longer lifespan than humans,

331
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,470
but they can only live 300 to 500 years,

332
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:12,670
including the time they spend as beasts.

333
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,190
Yuanzhong doesn't have that much time.

334
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,310
He's not young after all.

335
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,310
Is there a trick

336
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:19,350
that takes less time to learn?

337
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,110
Yes.

338
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:22,710
The demon clan has a trick

339
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,580
that induces rebirth with a drop of blood.

340
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,670
Reconstructing bones and flesh or growing a new head

341
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:27,990
is feasible without doubt.

342
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:29,310
Besides, one can quickly master this trick.

343
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:32,270
Doesn't it mean one has to finish demonization first?

344
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,590
That's for sure.

345
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:39,830
Let me think what other options there are...

346
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:45,260
Lord Taiqing's Eight Diagrams Furnace

347
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,350
is said to be able to melt everything.

348
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,140
Why don't you try melting the gold hoop

349
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,590
with that furnace?

350
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,110
The celestial ladder was destroyed long ago.

351
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:56,470
How am I supposed to bring Yuanzhong, a living soul,

352
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:57,510
to the Divine Realm?

353
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,390
And how am I supposed to

354
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:00,070
keep Yuanzhong safe

355
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:01,680
when the hoop is melting in the furnace?

356
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,550
Didn't you always

357
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:07,230
want to make a God Restraining Hoop?

358
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,390
Does this golden hoop

359
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:10,110
have something in common

360
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,830
with that God Restraining Hoop?

361
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,710
They are different.

362
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,300
None of my ideas work!

363
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,390
You are the God of Craft,

364
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:17,190
yet you can't think of a solution!

365
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,790
What can I do?

366
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:20,160
If I were you, I'd rather destroy

367
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,710
the hoop now that it can't be unclasped!

368
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,910
That's worth a try.

369
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,620
Have you noticed

370
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:42,070
that her being away for a few days

371
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:42,950
does not affect us

372
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:43,990
in any way?

373
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,190
Yeah, exactly.

374
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:46,430
I still have to do all the cooking,

375
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:47,190
boil water,

376
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:48,190
and sweep fallen leaves as usual.

377
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:52,140
The period for spirit refinement already passed.

378
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,790
Why hasn't Tianqu Peak taken any action yet?

379
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:55,270
I don't know.

380
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:56,590
Anyway, the reason can't be

381
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,680
that they are concerned about your health.

382
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:00,630
Never mind.

383
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,110
I can go meet him,

384
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:03,820
even though he didn't ask me to.

385
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:55,830
How many days are left until Dingxu's birthday?

386
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:57,550
Five. I'm keeping count.

387
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,150
That old man tells those

388
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:00,310
close to him

389
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,910
that his birthday is on June 17th,

390
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:02,920
but that's not true.

391
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:04,790
He was actually born in spring.

392
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,020
Wait!

393
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:11,870
Why are you following me again?

394
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:13,700
I certainly have to stick with you when you go out.

395
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,310
I have promised to do so!

396
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:20,910
Are you going to Tianqu Peak again?

397
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:24,570
Didn't I tell you not to?

398
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:27,270
You're just a maid.

399
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:29,070
Why should I listen to you?

400
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:31,990
You can't go there!

401
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:34,830
Ji Tanyin,

402
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:36,830
you'd better be clear about who you are

403
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,030
and what your job is.

404
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:41,300
My job is to protect you

405
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,350
and take good care of you.

406
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,110
If I turn a blind eye and do nothing

407
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,110
when I know clearly

408
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,110
that they're trying to hurt you,

409
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:47,870
I will be scourged by my conscience!

410
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:51,150
In my opinion,

411
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,710
Dingxu didn't ask to meet you anyway.

412
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:54,030
You don't have to go.

413
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:03,070
Didn't you hear what he said?

414
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,200
I'm already out.

415
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,150
Might as well take a walk.

416
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:37,550
Somebody get in here!

417
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:42,270
Grand Elder.

418
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:45,240
Tell Baili Xiang and Tanghua

419
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,470
to rally troops in the War Division.

420
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,510
What happened?

421
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,030
Yuanzhong has left the mountain.

422
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:02,960
It tastes sour!

423
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:04,110
Yuanzhong once said

424
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,630
only the fruit that has been exposed to sufficient sunlight

425
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:06,630
tastes sweet.

426
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:20,620
Yuanzhong, hurry up!

427
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:22,710
This is the wild fruit I found.

428
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:23,150
It's delicious.

429
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:23,550
Really?

430
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:24,750
You're the first one I thought of.

431
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:25,470
Try it now.

432
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:31,750
It tastes good!

433
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:42,870
What's wrong?

434
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:44,670
Nothing.

435
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:47,870
Let me see.

436
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:48,880
I said I'm fine.

437
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:49,790
Just let me take a look!

438
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,830
They have cast the restraint on you.

439
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:57,590
But we haven't

440
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:58,990
even gone far, have we?

441
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:01,390
How could they do this?

442
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:02,630
Aren't we still

443
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:03,950
within Youhu Clan's territory?

444
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:05,100
If we go a bit farther from here,

445
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:07,070
We'll be out of Youhu Clan's territory.

446
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:08,870
But we don't mean

447
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:09,960
to go far away.

448
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:11,870
They don't know that.

449
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:15,790
It's actually nice.

450
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:17,550
It has been decades

451
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:18,910
since I last came here.

452
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,550
Wait. I've brought some medicine.

453
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,190
It won't work.

454
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:26,670
They're hurting me with magic.

455
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:28,310
Ordinary medicine is of no help.

456
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,390
Turn your head.

457
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,110
I already told you it wouldn't work.

458
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:40,000
Does it hurt?

459
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,550
Of course it does.

460
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:47,050
You'll feel better when I apply medicine on you.

461
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:49,030
It'll work like a charm.

462
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:52,950
When I was bitten by a snake,

463
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:54,830
this is the medicine you applied on me, right?

464
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:56,230
What?

465
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,070
Can this medicine fix anything?

466
00:25:58,710 --> 00:25:59,910
You're such a chatterbox.

467
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,270
Tilt your head back.

468
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:17,550
Ji Tanyin.

469
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,990
Why are you so kind to me?

470
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:23,190
Because I am your handmaiden.

471
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:23,910
That's not it.

472
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:26,470
You have done

473
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:28,270
more for me than a handmaiden

474
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:29,430
is obligated to.

475
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:32,150
Why?

476
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:33,990
You're asking too many questions.

477
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:36,000
Answer me.

478
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,110
Because now

479
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:42,300
in this world,

480
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,590
I have only one mission.

481
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:44,950
And that is to be with you,

482
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:47,110
till your hair turns gray,

483
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,350
your teeth all fall out,

484
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:50,110
and you die of old age.

485
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,830
Your life will end one day.

486
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,480
I just want you to spend it happily.

487
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:56,020
You want me to spend my life happily?

488
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:57,070
Yes.

489
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:58,830
I always keep my promises.

490
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,310
That's a blessing I extend to you.

491
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:17,590
High Priest!

492
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,310
What beautiful scenery.

493
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:30,590
You must be in a good mood.

494
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:31,870
I'm just taking a stroll.

495
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:33,830
What are you doing here?

496
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:36,510
There is a spreading panic in the clan lately.

497
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:37,550
We are concerned

498
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:38,940
about your safety.

499
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:40,150
I'm doing great.

500
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:41,950
Thank you all for your concern.

501
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:43,440
High Priest,

502
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:45,640
why would you suddenly come to this place?

503
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,430
I wouldn't say "suddenly."

504
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:49,910
When I was young,

505
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:51,430
I often played here.

506
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:52,270
I especially liked

507
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,590
the prickly fruit growing there.

508
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,510
But since I became an adult,

509
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:56,990
I've been bothered by all sorts of affairs,

510
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:58,630
and never had a chance to come here again.

511
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:00,390
Recently, I have frequently

512
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:01,470
dreamed about this place.

513
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:02,870
So I thought I should come by.

514
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:04,590
Does that count as

515
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,710
an obsession of yours?

516
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:09,670
I guess it does.

517
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,390
I have such an obsession,

518
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:13,830
and it is affecting what I say and do.

519
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:15,430
It shows that my cultivation

520
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:16,630
is far from perfection.

521
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:18,510
I should go to Tianqu Peak more often

522
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:19,640
to strengthen my willpower.

523
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:21,820
However, after days of waiting,

524
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:22,990
I still didn't

525
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:24,480
hear from Elder Dingxu.

526
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:26,870
It was my fault.

527
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:29,190
I was worried about your health,

528
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:30,590
but I didn't realize

529
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,870
I was holding you back from your cultivation.

530
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:37,340
It's alright.

531
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,470
I can make up for it when I'm back.

532
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:43,750
Can we go back now?

533
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:45,510
Sure. Let's go.

534
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,150
After you, High Priest.

535
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:54,750
Sir,

536
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:55,820
what's going on?

537
00:28:58,390 --> 00:28:59,180
Tanghua!

538
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:00,910
Sir...

539
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:02,830
It's the possessing technique!

540
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:05,710
The possessing technique?

541
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:09,270
Sir!

542
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:15,270
Die, all of you!

543
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:17,400
Watch out!

544
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:28,790
Sir, wake up!

545
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:36,830
Yuanzhong,

546
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:40,230
I must kill you to honor our dead warriors!

547
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:40,990
Sir!

548
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,070
This is bad!

549
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:43,150
He is going to explode!

550
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,350
Sir!

551
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:48,270
Wake up!

552
00:29:58,830 --> 00:29:59,630
Sir.

553
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:03,310
Sir!

554
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:06,480
Sir?

555
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:07,950
Sir.

556
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:19,830
Those from Tianqu Peak have come and checked several times.

557
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:21,070
Fortunately, the Essence Nourishing Pill

558
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,430
was sent away long ago.

559
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:23,750
Young Mistress Dai,

560
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:25,910
will you leave with us?

561
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:33,130
That's great!

562
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:34,640
When the old City Lord sees you,

563
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:36,150
he will be thrilled.

564
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,270
Sir.

565
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:41,390
What's the rush?

566
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:43,880
Word has it that Mr. Tanghua

567
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,230
was harmed by the War Demons' possessing technique,

568
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:46,500
and is now confined in Jinxia Palace.

569
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:47,630
Who was harmed?

570
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,240
Mr. Tanghua from the War Division.

571
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:53,070
Young Mistress Dai...

572
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:55,030
You guys leave first.

573
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:56,740
I'll go back when this matter is settled.

574
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:10,750
Tie him up with a magic rope now!

575
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:13,150
The magic rope on the floor!

576
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:14,070
Hurry!

577
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:17,990
This?

578
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:19,070
Throw it now!

579
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:37,180
Tidy up the place.

580
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:17,400
You may leave now.

581
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:20,270
Are you hungry?

582
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:23,380
Do you need water and food?

583
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:30,660
Sir, get some rest.

584
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:31,910
I'll take my leave now.

585
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:46,190
I've been on this mountain for ten years.

586
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:48,590
I have meet you many times.

587
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,590
I just wanted to check on you,

588
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:52,670
and that was it.

589
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:54,060
Now,

590
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:56,150
I've got what I wanted.

591
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:58,090
What are you trying to say?

592
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,830
My name is Zhi Dai.

593
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:15,340
Mr. Tanghua,

594
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:16,550
goodbye.

595
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:29,520
[Jinxia Palace]

596
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:38,180
[Liujiao Palace]

597
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:50,480
It's snowing.

598
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:54,710
You keep walking.

599
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:56,590
I want some time alone.

600
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:16,190
I was indeed afflicted by the War Demons' possessing technique.

601
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:18,030
Everyone,

602
00:34:18,889 --> 00:34:20,489
the War Demons have returned.

603
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:21,840
How is it possible?

604
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:23,030
Didn't the War Demons all die

605
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:24,750
in Pinghu years ago?

606
00:34:24,989 --> 00:34:26,219
What should we do

607
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:27,630
if the War Demons attack us?

608
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:30,620
Who could resist the War Demons?

609
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:31,429
Yeah!

610
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:32,590
If that's true,

611
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:33,469
what can we do?

612
00:34:33,469 --> 00:34:34,790
I told you that was the War Demons' sorcery,

613
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:35,989
yet none of you believed me!

614
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,030
How about now?

615
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:38,190
Yeah.

616
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:39,969
Who can fight the War Demons off?

617
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:41,469
Quiet down.

618
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:43,840
Elder Xinyao,

619
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,380
what's your opinion?

620
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:47,510
The symptoms do look

621
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:50,270
a lot like those of the possessing technique.

622
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:51,750
Then what are we waiting for?

623
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:53,750
We should turn to the High Priest for help!

624
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:55,350
As long as he is around,

625
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,630
the War Demons won't be able

626
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:57,510
to stir up trouble.

627
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:58,550
The High Priest

628
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:00,630
managed to wipe out their whole clan years ago.

629
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:03,320
We'll let him do it again if necessary!

630
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:05,500
Yeah, he can do it again!

631
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,750
This is a serious issue.

632
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:09,990
We must think it through and devise a plan.

633
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,510
Discuss any other matter you want but not this one.

634
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:14,140
No matter how you deliberate on it,

635
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,590
the outcome will be the same.

636
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:17,270
Except the High Priest,

637
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:17,910
none of us

638
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:19,140
can fight the War Demons off.

639
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:21,490
Moreover, we must act quickly

640
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:23,470
before we miss out on the best opportunity!

641
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:25,350
Baili Xiang,

642
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:26,590
Lv Chengshi,

643
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:28,590
say something!

644
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:32,630
I think you've made a good point.

645
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:38,390
Elder Xinyao,

646
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:40,270
what do you think?

647
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:41,580
Grand Elder,

648
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:43,510
I also think

649
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:45,950
we should lift up the seal

650
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:47,350
on the High Priest.

651
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:48,730
What seal?

652
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:50,710
The golden hoop on the High Priest's neck.

653
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:52,750
Didn't the High Priest seal himself

654
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:53,830
with the golden hoop

655
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:54,990
to prove his determination to become a god?

656
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:57,060
-Yes!
-Yes!
-Yes!

657
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:58,310
Fine.

658
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:01,060
Let's invite the High Priest

659
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:02,910
to join us in the discussion.

660
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:22,020
Still reading?

661
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:24,710
You are the God of Craft.

662
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:27,210
No one can compare to you

663
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:28,670
in terms of craftsmanship.

664
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:30,470
If even you can't unclasp this lock,

665
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:32,830
then no one else can.

666
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:34,380
I do have a way to solve the problem,

667
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:35,790
but the current conditions don't allow me to.

668
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:37,910
If I am to wreck the golden hoop,

669
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:39,310
I need to make a new tool.

670
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:40,910
However, ordinary flames

671
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:42,100
can't help me form

672
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,550
something as hard as the hoop.

673
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:45,590
If I recklessly use divine power

674
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:47,400
in the mortal realm,

675
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:49,140
I'll suffer a backlash.

676
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,700
The formation on that golden hoop

677
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,590
is called Immortal Binding Lock.

678
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:56,150
Would it

679
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:58,070
have something in common

680
00:36:58,070 --> 00:36:59,110
with Ju Liusun's Immortal Binding Rope?

681
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:00,070
Maybe they can restrain immortals,

682
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:01,270
but not gods.

683
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:04,030
If Yuanzhong becomes a god,

684
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:06,390
he will break free from restrictions.

685
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:09,710
You don't get what I mean.

686
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:11,870
Have you considered

687
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:13,480
giving him some divine energy

688
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,540
so he can temporarily pass off as a god

689
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:16,950
and deceive the golden hoop?

690
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,530
Can I do that?

691
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:20,910
Of course you can!

692
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:21,870
Don't you remember?

693
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:23,750
In the war between gods and demons,

694
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:25,470
Ju Liusun's Immortal Binding Rope

695
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:26,590
was completely useless

696
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:27,590
because those on the battlefield

697
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:28,550
were either gods or demons,

698
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:30,030
without a single immortal.

699
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:33,430
The Immortal Binding Rope can't restrain a god.

700
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,510
Neither can the Immortal Binding Lock.

701
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:39,190
But whether he will let you

702
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:41,100
give him divine energy remains a question.

703
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:42,710
Will it reveal the truth

704
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:44,230
that you're a god if you do so?

705
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:45,390
No, it won't.

706
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:48,510
Deity Shiyi once gave me

707
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:49,790
some sand from Heng River.

708
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:51,630
It can freeze time.

709
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:55,150
Right. I'm going to use that.

710
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:33,350
You're defending the High Priest of Youhu Clan,

711
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:34,750
making vows with your spiritual heart,

712
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:36,190
and risking your own life.

713
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:37,590
Is it only because

714
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:38,790
he is a good person?

715
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:43,620
Yes.

716
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:47,950
By the way, Mr. Loong,

717
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:49,430
do you remember

718
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:50,750
I told you years ago

719
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:52,870
that I had a believer in the mortal realm?

720
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:55,670
I do remember.

721
00:38:58,830 --> 00:38:59,740
Do you mean...

722
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:38,580
I've found him.

723
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,900
Y-You're a god?

724
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,670
You're really a god?

725
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:26,430
Gods do exist!

726
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:28,270
You're real!

727
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:30,430
God,

728
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,270
I'm a believer of yours.

729
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:33,390
Can you make a wish

730
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:34,630
of mine come true?

731
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:35,920
What is your wish?

732
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:38,270
Can you kill all the War Demons?

733
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:40,150
They've been bullying us,

734
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:42,050
and they've killed many of our people!

735
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:43,910
I'm not the God of War.

736
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:45,670
I can't interfere with

737
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:46,750
the mortals' conflicts.

738
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:49,390
I can't make that wish of yours come true.

739
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:50,630
Well...

740
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:52,550
Can you save lives?

741
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:54,070
I have a good friend

742
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,110
whose name is Tanghua.

743
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:55,910
His parents

744
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:57,310
were killed by the War Demons.

745
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,670
He has been left alone.

746
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,660
I pity him.

747
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:01,750
Can you revive his parents?

748
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:03,670
The dead cannot be brought back to life.

749
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:05,530
I can't help you with that.

750
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:08,070
Then I...

751
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:09,430
Take your time with the thinking.

752
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:10,800
You have my promise.

753
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:12,790
I will make one of your wishes come true.

754
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:15,350
As long as it is moral and righteous,

755
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:17,070
I will make it come true.

756
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:19,550
Will I see you again?

757
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:20,480
Didn't you tell me

758
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,270
Fangwai Mountain looked beautiful when it snowed?

759
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:24,630
When it snows again,

760
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:26,430
take out the jade token and make a wish.

761
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:27,830
Then I will come meet you.

762
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:29,140
I got it, God.

763
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:31,920
I'll see you at that time!

764
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,230
I'll see you at that time.
