00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:48,950
Just you wait.

4
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:52,020
This is just the beginning.

5
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:00,310
Yuanzhong,

6
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:03,950
we'll be back!

7
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,710
Could this be the War Demons'

9
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,030
Go to Tianqu Peak and find Elder Dingxu now!

-Got it. -Got it.

11
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:19,950
Yuanzhong,

12
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:22,270
my name is Ji Tanyin,

the God of Craft in the Divine Realm.

14
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,110
Your Divine Left Hand

15
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,470
was forged by me.

16
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,070
Deity Taihe fell into a long slumber

17
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:31,310
due to the loss of his Divine Hand.

18
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,630
Yet you use the power of the Divine Hand

19
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,710
to harm living beings.

20
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,790
You don't deserve to be the host of the Divine Hand.

21
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:38,950
Today,

22
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:41,110
I shall reclaim the Divine Left Hand.

23
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,660
You will die for this.

24
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:54,790
But don't hold a grudge.

25
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,190
This is the so-called karma.

26
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,590
What goes around comes around.

27
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,310
You deserve it.

Good morning, guys.

36
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:56,110
Morning? More like late!

37
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,750
The meeting was scheduled for around 8 AM.

38
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,260
But it's already 2 PM now.

39
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:02,040
I even deliberately

40
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,430
set off two hours late,

41
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,590
but when I got here,

42
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,390
I was surprisingly the first to arrive!

43
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,430
Lord Wenying, you're always punctual.

44
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,590
I really respect that.

Oh, Senior Cheng

47
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,360
is sleeping soundly.

48
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,330
Have you had enough sleep?

49
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,140
Dingxu,

50
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,750
it's already so late!

51
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,490
The no-shows are probably not coming.

52
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:29,190
If you have something to say, just say it.

53
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,430
Yeah, Grand Elder.

54
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,670
The Elder Council hasn't convened for years.

55
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,870
I was surprised to receive

56
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:34,950
the news last night.

57
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,740
What exactly could be so important

58
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,350
to gather all of us here?

59
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,909
Grand Elder,

60
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,670
please just tell us.

61
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:44,510
You usually live far apart.

62
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,040
It's inconvenient for you to travel here.

63
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:48,990
Were it not for an urgent issue,

64
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,750
I wouldn't have bothered you.

65
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:54,180
However, today's case

66
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,510
is indeed pretty weird.

67
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,070
What exactly is it?

68
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:00,950
Go get Tanghua here.

69
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:01,850
Yes.

00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:37,150
Tanyin, why are you back?

72
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:38,590
Something's confusing me.

73
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:39,990
So I'd like to ask Hannv about it.

74
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,820
Your body is still in the mortal realm,

75
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:42,630
yet your soul is here.

76
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,040
That's not safe, I'm afraid.

77
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,950
Don't worry.

78
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,310
Is she inside?

79
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:50,180
Hannv has been in the Luofu Sea all along.

80
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:51,940
That place is the realm of Supreme Yin.

81
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:52,909
Guarding there for too long

82
00:06:52,909 --> 00:06:54,110
is not good for her health.

83
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:56,310
Please go and try to persuade her.

Tanyin!

89
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:33,390
Welcome back.

90
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,920
How is it?

91
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,110
Not good.

92
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,340
Taihe's taking a turn for the worse.

93
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,600
His primordial power

94
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:42,990
is gradually dissipating.

95
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:44,670
The Supreme Yin power of the Luofu Sea

96
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:46,110
can't sustain him for much longer.

97
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,870
What brings you back all of a sudden?

98
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,230
Is that High Priest of the Youhu Clan

99
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:52,270
a hard nut to crack?

100
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:55,790
There's something I can't figure out.

101
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,070
What is it?

102
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:58,790
I wanna ask you

103
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,430
if the High Priest of the Youhu Clan

104
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,600
is really a brutal man.

105
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,470
Why would you ask this?

106
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,790
I saw him.

107
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,150
And he seems different

108
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,150
from what everyone says.

109
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,310
Besides,

110
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,990
he's always wearing a golden hoop.

111
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,390
That's a sealing artifact.

112
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:14,600
I don't understand.

113
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,830
Isn't he the High Priest of the Youhu Clan

114
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,590
and the ruler of the mortal realm?

115
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:20,740
Why is he wearing a shackle?

116
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,230
Why do you care about this?

117
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,450
Of course I care.

118
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:27,550
If my guess is right,

119
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,750
then what we know

120
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,110
might all be false.

121
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:32,900
Maybe he's a weak man,

122
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:35,669
or maybe he's a good guy.

123
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,830
Is a weak person necessarily good?

124
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,789
Does wearing shackles prevent one from doing evil?

125
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:44,430
Perhaps just because

126
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:46,270
he committed too many evil deeds,

127
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:48,390
he was put under a seal

128
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:50,550
and bound with a restraining artifact.

129
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,590
You have a point, but...

130
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:54,550
But what?

131
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,430
Even if he is a good person,

132
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,550
so what?

133
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:59,660
The Divine Left Hand doesn't belong to him.

134
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,750
His taking possession of the divine artifact is a sin.

135
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:04,590
Deity Taihe is the Primordial God,

136
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:05,870
the law of heaven

137
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,470
chosen by the primordial power.

138
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,230
He's the guardian of all realms,

139
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,330
yet fell into a long slumber due to demon slaying.

140
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:12,670
Therefore,

141
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,590
whether that High Priest of the Youhu Clan

142
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:16,520
is good or evil,

143
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,110
righteous or wicked,

144
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,190
you have only one choice.

145
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:21,670
Tanyin,

146
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,710
Taihe has waited for too long.

147
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:25,190
Please help us.

148
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,140
That's not the way it works, Hannv.

149
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:34,950
The gods protect all living beings

150
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,290
with compassion for them.

151
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,670
Deliver them from torment.

152
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,110
All beings are equal.

153
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,350
All things are equal.

154
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,910
But maybe you're right.

155
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:46,140
The weak are not necessarily good.

156
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:47,470
Even those in shackles

157
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,870
may not be incapable of evil.

158
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,910
So I will get to the bottom of it.

159
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,070
What are you doing?

160
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:26,230
Just taking a break.

161
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:27,960
Early spring is the time

162
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:29,260
when animals in the mountains like snakes

163
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,270
are awakening.

164
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,360
You need to be careful.

165
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:43,990
What's wrong?

166
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:48,920
I've been poisoned, I guess.

167
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,030
It's alright.

168
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:56,830
I'm an immortal.

169
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,670
A snake bite won't kill me.

170
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:01,430
I'm here for you.

171
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,630
Greetings, Elders.

172
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:06,670
Tanghua,

173
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,950
it was your subordinate who got killed.

174
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,700
You've been investigating all night.

175
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,310
Did you find out anything?

176
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,660
Before Chiyi died, his eyes were blood-red,

177
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:15,790
his strength was immense,

178
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:18,630
and it seemed as if blood snakes were crawling under his skin

179
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,440
with faint incantations appearing on it.

180
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:21,710
More importantly,

181
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,980
he completely lost his mind,

182
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,870
like he had become a whole different person.

183
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,630
All of these signs

184
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,910
remind me of a possibility.

185
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:31,310
I suspect

186
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:34,710
he was affected by the possessing technique.

187
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:35,550
What?

188
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,070
Nonsense.

189
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,360
The possessing technique is a secret skill

190
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,550
of the War Demons,

191
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:43,470
Yet the War Demons have long since died out.

192
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:45,910
How could anyone fall victim to it nowadays?

193
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:48,590
I remember back then

194
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:50,480
we studied the possessing technique.

195
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,870
The possession

196
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,790
always happened on the target's birthday.

197
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,590
At that time, we analyzed

198
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:58,710
that this kind of unnatural evil technique

199
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:00,630
must have some limitations.

200
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:03,030
Blood and birth information

201
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:04,110
could all be

202
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:05,540
significant factors.

203
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,910
If it's true as you say

204
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,230
that Chiyi was hit by the possessing technique,

205
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:11,230
then yesterday

206
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,990
should be Chiyi's birthday.

207
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,870
Elder Xinyao's words make sense.

208
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,430
I've thought about this too.

209
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,470
But since the emergence of the evil possessing technique,

210
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:20,430
our people

211
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:22,230
have no longer celebrated birthdays.

212
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:23,190
One's birth information

213
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:24,950
has become everyone's personal secret.

214
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,070
Chiyi has no family.

215
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:29,510
Neither do I know

216
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,790
his exact date and time of birth.

217
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,300
The incident happened in the Liujiao Palace.

218
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,870
What did the High Priest say about it?

219
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,230
The High Priest was frightened last night

220
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,670
and rested early.

221
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,750
He didn't say much to me.

222
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:44,750
Frightened?

223
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,660
The High Priest is someone

224
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:49,150
who could even break through Pinghu Xianzhou with one blow.

225
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,830
Could this small case

226
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,390
possibly frighten him?

227
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:54,110
In this world,

228
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:55,950
no one

229
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,550
knows the War Demons better than him.

230
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,470
Then let's invite the High Priest here.

231
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:02,270
Yes.

232
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,590
What is this?

233
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,270
It knocked me out yesterday.

234
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,830
I-It didn't knock you out.

235
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:10,070
It's because

236
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:11,590
it contains a strong alcoholic scent.

237
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,070
So it makes people intoxicated.

238
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,270
A good sleep

239
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,740
is the first step to welcoming good fortune.

240
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:22,780
Aren't you maids

241
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:24,390
supposed to be training at Xiaoxiang Peak?

242
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:25,790
How did you end up here?

243
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,710
There was a big dog over there,

244
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:29,710
chasing after people.

245
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,020
I got scared and took a wrong turn.

246
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,390
There are no dogs on Fangwai Mountain.

247
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,190
How could there be

248
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:35,470
no dogs on such a huge mountain？

249
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,590
Perhaps it ran here from somewhere else.

250
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:37,790
You just don't know that.

251
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,500
Let me apply some medicine for you.

252
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:08,590
Where is it?

253
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,740
I remember I've got some.

254
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:14,910
Found it.

255
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,960
That's it. This medicine is super effective.

256
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,110
What's that?

257
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:31,030
It's a portable cosmic bag.

258
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:32,230
A portable cosmic bag?

259
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,510
Isn't that the personal artifact

260
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:36,350
of Goddess Wushuang, the God of Craft?

261
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,420
They say the crafting method has long been lost.

262
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:39,450
How do you have one?

263
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,070
Lost?

264
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,210
Actually, it's quite simple.

265
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,060
This is just an ordinary artifact.

266
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,550
Don't you immortals also have

267
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,070
spells for telekinesis?

268
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:53,550
It's the same principle.

269
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,050
-But...
-Yuanzhong!

270
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:57,790
Yuanzhong.

271
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:00,990
The Council of Elders sent a messenger here,

272
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:01,990
asking you to go over.

273
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:08,230
What's wrong?

274
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:09,620
Nothing.

275
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:10,890
I just got bitten by a snake.

276
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:15,630
You're Ji Tanyin, right?

277
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,350
How do you know that?

278
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,620
Of course I know.

279
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:24,310
Don't you know who I am?

280
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,430
No, I don't.

281
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,120
Then you're stupid.

282
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:36,950
Grand Elder,

283
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:39,620
the High Priest said

284
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,350
he hasn't finished his studies for today,

285
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,350
so he can't come.

286
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,250
He asked me to pass on a message to you.

287
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:45,380
He said

288
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:48,230
all the War Demons were wiped out in Pinghu

289
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,580
with no survivors.

290
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,510
Anyone who doubts this

291
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:52,550
for any reason

292
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:54,030
must be up to something

293
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,550
and should be thoroughly investigated.

294
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:01,950
Go investigate Ji Tanyin.

295
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:03,510
Like her birth details,

296
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:04,630
background,

297
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:05,790
life experiences,

298
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:06,790
hobbies, and interests.

299
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:07,670
I wanna know everything.

300
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:09,550
Why? Does she work for Dingxu?

301
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:10,430
Doesn't seem like it.

302
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:13,470
Then is she a spy sent by the human race?

303
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:16,350
Not sure yet.

304
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:17,430
She couldn't be

305
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:18,830
sent by the War Demons, right?

306
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:22,190
The Elders' meeting should be over.

307
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:24,430
Tanghua must be furious.

308
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:25,870
No way...

309
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,020
He's a petty simpleton.

310
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,030
That's true.

311
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:40,790
Tanyin, you're back.

312
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,250
We need to go to the Teaching Hall after dinner.

313
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,550
Tomorrow is the day for the immortal elders

314
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:45,750
of each peak to select their maids.

315
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:46,830
We need to draw lots in advance

316
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:47,990
to determine the order.

317
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:49,110
Select maids?

318
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,190
Tomorrow?

319
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,740
I know I'm asking for too much.

320
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:03,960
This is my own affair.

321
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,310
I should handle it myself.

322
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,230
God,

323
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:09,880
please bless me.

324
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:16,599
[Youhu Clan's Xiaoxiang Peak]

325
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,349
Remember the rules

326
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:19,550
of the grand selection.

327
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:20,780
You will go in

328
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,099
and wait for instructions.

329
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:23,750
Whether you stay or leave

330
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,430
depends on your fate.

331
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,910
Madam, aren't coming in with us?

332
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,660
It's about time. You may go in.

333
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,270
-Yes, Madam. -Yes, Madam.

334
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:32,590
Well, Lord Wenying,

335
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,190
how weird.

336
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:35,510
You don't indulge in women,

337
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:36,720
nor do you accept female disciples.

338
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,020
Why are you here today

339
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,110
to select maids?

340
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,950
The old cook has aged,

341
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:44,550
and the new one is clumsy,

342
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:46,160
making food like swill.

343
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,510
It is a top priority.

344
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,950
I heard that these human maids

345
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:54,990
are proficient in music, chess, calligraphy, and painting.

346
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,980
Not to mention their top-class needlework and cooking.

347
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,690
Hope you choose a good one for yourself.

348
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,510
Baili, Lord Wenying,

349
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:10,870
Elder Xinyao.

350
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:13,750
Tanghua, you are now

351
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,150
one of the Elders.

352
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:16,570
No need to be so formal.

353
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,350
Have you finished arranging Chiyi's funeral?

354
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:22,150
You seem to have quite some free time.

355
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:27,910
Tanghua, take a seat.

356
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:29,060
It's about to begin.

357
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,540
The High Priest has arrived!

358
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:39,270
No wonder you're here.

359
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,310
-High Priest. -High Priest.

360
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,300
What a rare sight.

361
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,590
Even you have joined us today.

362
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:54,150
Seems like these maid candidates

363
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:55,310
are quite fortunate.

364
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,070
You're late, High Priest.

365
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:59,910
I suppose you must have been held up

366
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,230
by some fair maid.

367
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:03,300
Indeed.

368
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,030
These human women

369
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:06,340
mostly don't cultivate the Dao.

370
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,660
They just pursue beauty.

371
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:10,150
Lord Wenying, you're getting on in years

372
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:11,390
with a dignified appearance.

373
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,700
You surely don't know my troubles.

374
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:28,350
High Priest,

375
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,570
Elder Dingxu is swamped with work.

376
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:32,830
So he's asked me to preside over this year's

377
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:33,870
maid selection ceremony.

378
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:35,100
Therefore, today's main examination

379
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,470
will follow the old rules.

380
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:39,670
We will test the four arts—music, chess, calligraphy, and painting.

381
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,470
You wanna be a maid in the Liujiao Palace?

382
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:48,550
Can you really pass

383
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:49,710
the maid assessment?

384
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:53,180
Though calligraphy and painting are not my forte,

385
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:55,550
I think I should be able to pass.

386
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:57,490
I know little about music.

387
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:59,350
But I can cheat a little.

388
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:02,060
I only don't know what to do with chess.

389
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,790
You've come to the right person.

390
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,080
In all six realms, when it comes to chess,

391
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:09,750
if I rank second,

392
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,740
no one dares to claim they're first.

393
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:13,150
Then

394
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,180
I'll be counting on you, Mr. Loong.

395
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:21,880
This round of assessment

396
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,200
will test your chess skills.

397
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,140
You'll play against each other in pairs.

398
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:26,030
The losers will be eliminated.

399
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:27,430
Let's begin.

400
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:43,180
Please give me a minute to think.

401
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:50,510
The same old opening moves

402
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,040
in chess.

403
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,110
A thousand years have passed,

404
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,270
yet the human chess players

405
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:55,710
haven't improved much.

406
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:04,590
Just for this one move,

407
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:06,070
is it necessary to think for so long?

408
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:17,460
You...

409
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,180
What a brilliant move!

410
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:33,790
With such amazing chess skills,

411
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,190
she could have

412
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,340
ended this game quickly.

413
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,510
Why is she putting on a show

414
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:40,630
and dragging it out like this?

415
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,030
Perhaps she wants to attract

416
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,230
our attention.

417
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:44,970
Although we're the ones selecting,

418
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,320
they also have their preferences

419
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:49,150
for which immortal elder to serve and follow.

420
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:53,110
I lost.

421
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:00,950
Good game.

422
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,790
High Priest,

423
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:05,130
do you know her?

424
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,140
I've met her a few times.

425
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:11,290
No wonder you graced us with your presence.

426
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:12,680
Turns out you've got

427
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:15,050
someone in mind.

428
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,180
The first round is over.

429
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,670
Winners, go prepare

430
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:24,980
for the next test,

431
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:26,000
music skills.

432
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:37,070
That is a smooth

433
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,510
and lingering melody.

434
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:39,910
Excellent.

435
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:44,230
Next.

436
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:45,470
Ji Tanyin.

437
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:51,200
We've prepared an instrument here.

438
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,910
I'm used to playing my own instrument.

439
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:53,990
Sheng Xiang,

440
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:55,670
all music masters

441
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:57,040
prefer to use their own instruments.

442
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:58,030
Let her use it.

443
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:11,830
I need to tune it.

444
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:02,110
Those of you who have made it this far

445
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:03,430
are all exceptionally skilled

446
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:04,460
and outstanding candidates.

447
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:06,190
I want to congratulate you in advance

448
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,590
on your stay.

449
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:10,580
Thank you, Immortal Elder.

450
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,390
For this final round,

451
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:14,580
you can choose

452
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,500
to showcase your best talents.

453
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:19,350
If you're fortunate enough to be picked by an immortal elder,

454
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,370
you'll have the chance to cultivate under their guidance.

455
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:24,670
This is a great opportunity.

456
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:27,450
Cherish it well.

457
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:28,770
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.

458
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:45,920
[Forbidden Land] [Into the land, into the doom.]

459
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:48,090
There's an intruder! Stay alert!

460
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,440
What's your talent?

461
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:56,860
I am a craftsman.

462
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:58,470
Craftsman?

463
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:00,860
What does a craftsman do?

464
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:02,920
A concept from the human realm.

465
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:03,910
Just an artisan.

466
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:06,230
They're good at making things like carriages,

467
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:07,030
tables, chairs,

468
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:08,490
household items, and decorations.

469
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,460
What kind of talent is that?

470
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:13,340
Don't tell me you're going to

471
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,680
build a carriage right here, huh?

472
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,110
I can, actually.

473
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:17,350
But the space here

474
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,390
doesn't seem big enough.

475
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:19,430
Besides, building a carriage

476
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:20,950
doesn't require much skill.

477
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,550
So what are you going to demonstrate?

478
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:26,170
I can unlock this.

479
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:29,470
Lord Wenying,

480
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:31,230
if I remember correctly,

481
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,030
it was you who made this batch

482
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,430
of Two-Form Immobilizing Bracelets.

483
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,310
That's true.

484
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:37,240
I made them.

485
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,470
Young lady,

486
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,500
are you serious?

487
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:42,190
The Two-Form Immobilizing Bracelet

488
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:44,020
is made of immortal gold,

489
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:46,430
containing a binding formation.

490
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:48,350
They are divine artifacts of our clan.

491
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:50,510
How could a mere craftsman like you

492
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:52,390
unlock them so easily?

493
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:53,630
Are you...

494
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:04,230
How did you do that?

495
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:06,670
Everything in nature has strengths and weaknesses.

496
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:07,790
There's no such thing

497
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:09,270
as an indestructible object.

498
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:11,110
Although immortal gold is tough,

499
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,670
it also has vulnerabilities.

500
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,030
Moreover, human craftsmanship

501
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:16,830
isn't limited to making

502
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:18,350
household items and decorations only.

503
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:20,270
What do you think, High Priest?

504
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:24,110
What are you trying to say?

505
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,370
This Two-Form Immobilizing Bracelet

506
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:27,960
is just a minor artifact

507
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,030
with simple craftsmanship.

508
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:31,070
Why not let me try something else?

509
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,350
What else do you want to unlock?

510
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:35,790
The shackle around your neck, High Priest.

511
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,260
I'd like to give it a try.

512
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:44,710
What did you just say?

513
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,350
I said I want to try

514
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:48,010
if I can open that shackle.

515
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:49,470
How dare you!

516
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:50,750
This golden hoop

517
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:52,020
was finely forged with the combined efforts

518
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:52,870
of our entire clan

519
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:54,310
and specially presented to the High Priest.

520
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:56,030
Don't speak nonsense!

521
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:57,820
Restraint and confinement make a lock.

522
00:27:58,030 --> 00:27:59,590
Binding and imprisonment make shackles.

523
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,640
It's just a tool to restrict freedom

524
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:03,150
and curb power!

525
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,910
You make it sound so nice,

526
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,950
but why don't you wear it yourself?

527
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:07,870
You...

528
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:09,510
You're not wrong.

529
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:11,150
This was indeed forged for me

530
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:12,420
by the Elders of my clan.

531
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,990
But you only see a shackle

532
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:16,750
without seeing the deeper meaning.

533
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:18,230
Haven't you heard of that?

534
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:20,140
"Throwing one into a deadly place of no return

535
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,680
will make him or her stronger."

536
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,700
This is from your human military strategy.

537
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,230
I find it quite reasonable.

538
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:27,950
The Tao Te Ching also says,

539
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,910
"Reduce again and again until you reach non-action.

540
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:33,040
Through non-action, you can achieve everything.

541
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:34,640
Those who know and outdo themselves

542
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:35,750
are enlightened and strong."

543
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:37,590
You see it as a shackle,

544
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:38,950
but I see it

545
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,070
as a ladder of greatness and success

546
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:42,030
to climb.

547
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:43,910
If it's not a shackle,

548
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:46,470
do you dare to let me unlock it?

549
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:56,790
Sure.

550
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:57,710
High Priest!

551
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:00,230
Do you really think

552
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:02,010
a mere human girl

553
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:03,660
can open this golden hoop?

554
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:04,370
Well...

555
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:24,820
Come on,

556
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:26,890
give it a try.

557
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:02,830
Yuanzhong!

558
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:10,710
How is it?

559
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:13,060
This is no ordinary craftsmanship.

560
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,150
I can't unlock it for now.

561
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:17,580
Recognizing your shortcomings

562
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,560
is also a kind of gain.

563
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:22,780
This girl is so bold

564
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:23,950
that she's even hurt you, High Priest.

565
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:25,550
I'll take her away for punishment.

566
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:26,390
Don't bother.

567
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:28,370
It's nothing but a minor injury.

568
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:30,260
I like this girl.

569
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,070
Let her join my Liujiao Palace.

570
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:33,510
No way...

571
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:35,830
Why not?

572
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,120
Isn't she the one you selected?

573
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:42,430
Tell me, Ji Tanyin.

574
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:44,020
Would you like to join my Liujiao Palace

575
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:44,920
as a maid

576
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:47,470
to follow and serve me?

577
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:53,070
Yes, I'd like to.

578
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:02,390
Yuanzhong, you brat.

579
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:04,210
Go to hell.

580
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:17,110
Stop!

581
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,960
There you are.

582
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:36,060
The end draws near; desperation haunts.

583
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,550
The end draws near; desperation haunts.

584
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:39,070
The end draws near; desperation haunts.

585
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:40,580
The end draws near; desperation haunts.

586
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,070
The end draws near; desperation haunts.

587
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,540
The end draws near; desperation haunts.

588
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:45,350
The end draws near; desperation haunts.

589
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:47,870
Xiazhi!

590
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,390
Zi Fei, what did you do?

591
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:51,630
He's gone mad,

592
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:52,670
trying to kill the High Priest!

593
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:53,710
Shouldn't I kill him?

594
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,450
Xiazhi...

595
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:57,740
Xiazhi...

596
00:31:58,390 --> 00:31:59,960
What did his last words mean?

597
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:02,240
Did anyone understand?

598
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:05,410
The end draws near;

599
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,890
desperation haunts.

600
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,190
High Priest.

601
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:28,790
You're here.

602
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:32,150
You look upset.

603
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:34,870
Is it because General Xiazhi

604
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:36,230
was possessed today?

605
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:41,280
Do you know what possession is?

606
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:42,790
I've heard about it.

607
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:43,920
It's a method that the War Demons use

608
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:46,350
to control others.

609
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:47,910
As long as they know the person's name

610
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:48,790
and date of birth,

611
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:51,090
they can use sorcery to manipulate them,

612
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:52,430
making them live

613
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:53,670
or die at will.

614
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,730
That's an extremely vicious mean.

615
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:58,910
You seem to know quite a bit.

616
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:01,780
Are there just the two of us

617
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:03,470
on Yuquan Peak?

618
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:05,270
Zi Fei's usually here too,

619
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:06,720
but not tonight.

620
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:16,190
They've got me

621
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:17,230
a new one.

622
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:18,870
Can you still remove it?

623
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,550
They've changed the restriction slightly.

624
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:23,230
I need to work on it a bit more.

625
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:26,950
Your craftsmanship is impressive.

626
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:29,760
What a pity I couldn't remove yours.

627
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:30,910
Mine?

628
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,950
Mine isn't so easy to remove.

629
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:37,080
It looks a bit heavy.

630
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:38,890
It's actually way heavier than it looks.

631
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:40,710
Then why do you always wear it?

632
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:42,150
Too many onlookers during the day.

633
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:43,670
But now you can tell the truth.

634
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:44,620
Because it looks good.

635
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:46,340
Don't you feel uncomfortable with it?

636
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:48,230
Not at all.

637
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:50,390
But it has already

638
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:51,390
cut your neck.

639
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:52,710
For the sake of beauty,

640
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,100
a little sacrifice

641
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:55,260
is inevitable.

642
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,040
It's getting late. You may leave now.

643
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,760
My method is not feasible for my dad.

644
00:34:20,949 --> 00:34:23,179
But the Youhu Clan also has a secret way to longevity.

645
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:25,710
The elixir of immortality

646
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:27,150
concocted by Grand Elder Dingxu

647
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:28,630
has miraculous effects on our clan.

648
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:30,830
Can we

649
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:32,550
ask the Youhu Clan for it directly?

650
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:34,030
They won't give it to us.

651
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:37,620
We need to find a way

652
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:39,110
to remove this thing.

653
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:42,670
There's someone

654
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,429
who might be able to help us.

655
00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:53,920
The end draws near; desperation haunts.

656
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:57,030
Is this the phrase you heard?

657
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:58,430
I'm sure.

658
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:01,630
Have the War Demons really come back?

659
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:02,710
Nonsense!

660
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:04,580
Everyone can say a few mottos of the War Demons!

661
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:06,030
What does that prove?

662
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:06,950
Exactly.

663
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:07,790
In that battle at Pinghu,

664
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:09,590
the War Demons all died right before us.

665
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,280
We all witnessed it ourselves.

666
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:12,580
If you don't believe others,

667
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:14,190
you should at least trust your own eyes!

668
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:16,450
The War Demons at Pinghu did die out.

669
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:18,390
But who can guarantee

670
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:20,190
that they don't have other clan members

671
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:21,550
who hid elsewhere and survived?

672
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:23,350
If they're still alive,

673
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:25,110
why have they been silent for years?

674
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,110
Our clan and the humans

675
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:27,270
have searched everywhere

676
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:28,550
yet found nothing.

677
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:29,910
The world is vast.

678
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:31,990
Are you sure you haven't missed anything?

679
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:33,790
Tanghua,

680
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,470
it's a man of your troops who died again.

681
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:37,870
Do you have anything to say?

682
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:39,390
I have no idea.

683
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:41,300
It's the War Demons.

684
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:42,470
That's right.

685
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,080
It's them.

686
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:46,750
Lord Wenying,

687
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,870
what did you say? Speak up.

688
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:50,020
I said it's the War Demons!

689
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,150
It must be them!

690
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:52,660
I saw the possessing technique

691
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:54,270
on the battlefield with my own eyes.

692
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:55,990
It's exactly the same as what happened to Xiazhi!

693
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:57,830
They've returned.

694
00:35:58,310 --> 00:36:00,430
The War Demons have come back!

695
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,360
Clam down, Lord Wenying.

696
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:04,100
This hasn't been confirmed yet.

697
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,990
It'll be too late if we wait for confirmation!

698
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:09,590
The High Priest...

699
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,070
Dingxu,

700
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:13,340
you should remove the High Priest's...

701
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,070
Silence!

702
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:23,630
Everything's just speculation at this point.

703
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:25,150
We shouldn't lose our composure, right?

704
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,630
This matter requires further investigation.

705
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,340
Since two men of the troops lost their minds,

706
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:32,990
all soldiers shall disarm

707
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:33,990
and submit to questioning.

708
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:34,910
Baili Xiang,

709
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:39,150
I'm entrusting this to you.

710
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:40,710
Understood.

711
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:43,030
No one is allowed to disturb

712
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:44,990
the High Priest's cultivation

713
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:46,350
until we find out the truth.

714
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:48,470
Do you understand?

715
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:49,710
-Yes. -Yes.

716
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:19,280
Are you Elder Lv Chengshi of Quantan Mountain?

717
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:20,270
Yes, it's me.

718
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:22,310
I have something important to ask you.

719
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:23,620
You must tell me everything you know.

720
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:24,430
Yes.

721
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:26,150
Isn't the High Priest of the Youhu Clan

722
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:27,670
the hero of your people?

723
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,560
He defeated the War Demons.

724
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:31,670
Why did you still put

725
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:32,950
the restraining golden hoop on him?

726
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,020
What exactly happened?

727
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:47,070
Tell me the truth.

728
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,710
That incident happened 60 years ago,

729
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,410
right after the Battle of Pinghu.

730
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,540
[60 years ago]

731
00:37:58,790 --> 00:37:59,670
What is this?

732
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:01,950
This golden hoop can seal

733
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:03,070
the Divine Left Hand,

734
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:04,630
depriving you of the divine power,

735
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:06,190
and you'll become mortal again.

736
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:07,550
Yuanzhong,

737
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:10,110
you are the hero who wiped out the War Demons,

738
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:11,550
the savior who rescued countless people

739
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:12,510
from suffering.

740
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,310
You are our High Priest.

741
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,140
We admire and love you.

742
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:17,190
This won't change

743
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:18,800
whether you have divine power or not.

744
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:19,710
Besides,

745
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,740
the Divine Left Hand is a divine artifact

746
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,140
feeding on life force.

747
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:25,300
You're nurturing it with a mortal body.

748
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,310
You may be able to endure it for a while,

749
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:28,510
but over time,

750
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:30,150
it might backfire on you.

751
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:33,440
I can already control it.

752
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,590
Please rest assured on this, Grand Elder.

753
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:36,960
You don't understand.

754
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,760
There's another reason.

755
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:41,360
You were blessed to hold a divine artifact,

756
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,660
saving all living beings from disaster

757
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,000
and accumulating immense merit.

758
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:45,270
With such a rare encounter,

759
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:48,510
have you ever thought about transcending mortality

760
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:50,310
and ascending to deity?

761
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:51,510
Ascending to deity?

762
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:53,960
The celestial ladder has been destroyed.

763
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:55,110
The Gate of Heaven is closed.

764
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:56,070
In this world,

765
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:58,070
no one can ascend to heaven and become a god anymore.

766
00:38:58,470 --> 00:38:59,270
Is that so?

767
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:01,670
But he doesn't know.

768
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:04,270
He hasn't thought about it.

769
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:05,350
He really hasn't thought about it.

770
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:06,390
That's true...

771
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:07,880
He really didn't.

772
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:09,390
As expected.

773
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:11,630
Yes, you didn't think about it.

774
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,030
Even though you were

775
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:14,740
just one step away from the deity,

776
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:16,020
you couldn't make it.

777
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:18,510
Grand Elder,

778
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:19,670
I don't understand.

779
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:21,870
You think I could become a god?

780
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,750
Of course.

781
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:24,940
You are the host of the Divine Left Hand,

782
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:26,990
possessing power comparable to that of gods.

783
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:28,830
You've also completely annihilated the War Demons,

784
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:30,440
achieving numerous accomplishments.

785
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:31,590
Who in history

786
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:33,230
could be compared to you?

787
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:35,110
Why couldn't you become a god?

788
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:36,750
But I haven't...

789
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:39,620
It's because you can't get rid of the Five Sins.

790
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,720
You're deeply stuck in worldly desires,

791
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,550
unable to transcend.

792
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:44,710
The Five Sins?

793
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:45,910
That's right.

794
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:48,630
Hypocrisy,

795
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:49,710
obsession,

796
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,590
ignorance,

797
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:51,590
jealousy,

798
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:52,440
and cruelty.

799
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:53,870
All evil in the world

800
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:55,270
stems from these.

801
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:56,990
All people are stuck in these,

802
00:39:58,430 --> 00:39:59,630
and you are no exception.

803
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:02,510
You've made great achievements at such a young age,

804
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:04,190
but unfortunately, your mind is too simple.

805
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:05,910
You haven't experienced the trials of the mortal world,

806
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:06,870
without a firm resolve.

807
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:08,070
How can you ascend?

808
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:10,230
Only by sealing the divine artifact,

809
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:12,910
comprehending the world with a mortal body,

810
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,100
and solving the Five Sins thoroughly,

811
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:16,910
will you have the chance to obtain deity.

812
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,030
I don't understand.

813
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:20,980
He's your High Priest!

814
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:22,750
Why are you treating him like this?
