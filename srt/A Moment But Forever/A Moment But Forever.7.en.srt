[A Moment But Forever]

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,140
[Episode 7]

3
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,310
Can't we allow mortal beings

4
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,630
and Yuanzhong to see more of

5
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:51,750
this world?

6
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,270
No wonder Deity Shangshan

7
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,750
wanted to set rules with you.

8
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:56,950
You've become emotional

9
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,310
and lost your rationality.

10
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:00,310
You're the one who has

11
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,630
become emotional and irrational,

12
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:02,510
not me.

13
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,430
Hannv,

14
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,150
I know you're an incense deity

15
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,669
with many eyes and ears in the mortal realm.

16
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:10,430
You must know what's about to happen.

17
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,110
Yuanzhong must be in danger,

18
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,680
that's why you're trying to stop me from going back.

19
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:14,670
But it won't work.

20
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,230
You can't stop me.

21
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,790
I have something to say.

22
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:07,750
Baili Xiang.

23
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:09,350
What's gotten into you now?

24
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:10,780
Can't whatever you have to say wait

25
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,110
until after the seal is removed?

26
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:13,590
If we wait until the seal is removed,

27
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,990
it will be too late.

28
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,000
High Priest,

29
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,920
you said before that in the battle of Pinghu,

30
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,110
the War Demon Clan

31
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,870
had all died by your hand.

32
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,070
Is that true or not?

33
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,020
Yes,

34
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:30,470
I did say that.

35
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,590
But I think I was too arrogant.

36
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,829
There might have been a few

37
00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:34,870
who escaped.

38
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,190
It's not impossible.

39
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,350
High Priest, you're being so modest.

40
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:40,350
I suppose these years

41
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:41,800
of spiritual cultivation at Tianqu Peak

42
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,470
have been very beneficial to you.

43
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,270
The power of the Divine Left Hand

44
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,470
is evident to everyone.

45
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:47,910
Since you said that

46
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:50,130
they were all killed,

47
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,790
then they must have been killed.

48
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:53,870
But if they all died,

49
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:54,829
then how do you explain

50
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:56,190
these possessions?

51
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,790
I've been puzzled about this too.

52
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:00,630
So recently, I secretly

53
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:02,230
conducted a small investigation.

54
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,550
Greetings, High Priest.

55
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,430
Who are they?

56
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,600
[Madam Zhuo and Madam Lanshan of Youhu Clan]

57
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:25,870
Senior Cheng,

58
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,110
you're fond of drinking

59
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,310
and are still unmarried,

60
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,670
so naturally you wouldn't know them.

61
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:31,110
Elder Xinyao,

62
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,540
this is Madam Zhuo, our clan's medical woman.

63
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,420
Years ago,

64
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,990
she studied medicine under you.

65
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:37,070
Do you remember?

66
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:39,230
She did indeed study under me,

67
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,590
specializing in women's medicine.

68
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,430
Elder Xinyao's medical skills are excellent,

69
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,750
so the disciples she trains

70
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,230
are naturally skilled as well.

71
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:45,990
So in recent years,

72
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,510
most of our clan's newborns

73
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:49,110
have been delivered by her.

74
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,440
This includes

75
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:55,080
Generals Chiyi and Xiazhi.

76
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:57,590
Madam Zhuo,

77
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:58,750
tell us,

78
00:04:58,909 --> 00:04:59,950
when was General Chiyi

79
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:02,870
born? On what year, month, and day?

80
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:03,550
Yes.

81
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,430
It's been too long.

82
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:09,600
Besides, there was the war against the War Demon Clan.

83
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,270
To protect them against the possessing techniques,

84
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,710
the Council of Elders destroyed

85
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:15,260
all the birth records of the clan members.

86
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,190
There are no records left to check.

87
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:20,160
But when Elder Baili came to inquire,

88
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,270
I went back to search through

89
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,430
my personal notes.

90
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:24,790
And I actually found something.

91
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,630
General Chiyi's mother

92
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,390
was a winemaker at Penglai Pavilion.

93
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:30,030
She was also an acquaintance of mine.

94
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,630
On the day she gave birth,

95
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:35,310
it happened to be the day when new rice was ripe.

96
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,630
That day, she was working in the workshop

97
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,710
when she suddenly felt abdominal pain.

98
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,070
So she called for me.

99
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,150
On my way there, I passed through the rice fields.

100
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,470
I saw the rice ears swaying,

101
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:46,909
spreading gold across the ground.

102
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,150
It was a beautiful sight.

103
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:49,510
So when I returned,

104
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,500
I wrote it down in my notes.

105
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:52,670
So you're saying

106
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,950
General Chiyi's birthday

107
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,670
was in autumn?

108
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:57,510
Yes.

109
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,110
That's strange.

110
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,990
General Chiyi was killed by possession

111
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,270
on March 19th.

112
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:05,550
But his birthday was in autumn.

113
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,590
Does everyone think this makes sense?

114
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,060
Even she herself said

115
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,470
it was a long time ago,

116
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,750
so maybe she remembered it wrong.

117
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,190
I was also afraid she might have remembered incorrectly,

118
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,990
so I asked someone else.

119
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,700
This elderly lady is from the Peng clan of Lanshan.

120
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,020
She's the current head of the family,

121
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,370
Madam Lanshan.

122
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:24,980
Grand Elder,

123
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,430
and all the Elders,

124
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:31,570
I am Xiazhi's grandmother.

125
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,470
Although it's not our clan's custom

126
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,590
to celebrate birthdays,

127
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,720
I still remember

128
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,510
which day my own grandson

129
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,390
was born.

130
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,670
Xiazhi was born on

131
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:49,520
the 6th of November.

132
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:52,270
The day before he was killed,

133
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,390
he came back to visit me.

134
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:57,180
He served me tea,

135
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,230
burned incense, and washed clothes.

136
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,070
Before he left,

137
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,590
he knelt before me

138
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,030
and kowtowed three times,

139
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:10,070
saying he was grateful for my nurturing grace.

140
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,670
I was puzzled before,

141
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,600
but now I realize

142
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:17,590
he knew his time had come,

143
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:18,780
and he came back

144
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,230
to bid me farewell.

145
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,610
Madam, please accept my condolences.

146
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:34,990
Mr. Tanghua,

147
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,610
do you have anything to say?

148
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,150
I have nothing to say.

149
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,390
Then if I say that

150
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:43,590
the possession was actually fabricated,

151
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,970
and someone was behind it,

152
00:07:46,909 --> 00:07:47,710
do you

153
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:50,090
still have nothing to say?

154
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,550
Baili,

155
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,670
this is a serious matter. You mustn't speak recklessly.

156
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:55,190
Of course I'm not speaking recklessly.

157
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,430
The evil art of possession

158
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:00,070
is a secret technique of the War Demon clan.

159
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:01,350
Although I don't know

160
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:02,830
the specific method of performing it,

161
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,060
those who have been possessed

162
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,390
have three characteristics.

163
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:06,870
First,

164
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:09,190
they are unable to control themselves, behaving irrationally

165
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,800
as if possessed by a foreign entity.

166
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:11,700
Second,

167
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:13,750
the multiple spiritual energies within the body result in chaos

168
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,350
and a risk of dying from the body exploding.

169
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,230
Third,

170
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:19,060
spells will cover their entire body.

171
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,790
The first two characteristics can be faked if one is

172
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:21,670
willing to risk their life,

173
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:23,120
but the third characteristic

174
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,110
requires some special techniques.

175
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,510
This insect is called Tiankui.

176
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:44,230
Due to its small and weak nature,

177
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:46,180
it naturally possesses the ability to conceal itself.

178
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,390
Only under spiritual energy

179
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:48,510
will it become visible.

180
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:49,310
If we use this insect's

181
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:50,630
secreted fluid as ink

182
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,390
to write spells all over the body,

183
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:53,710
it's normally invisible.

184
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:55,070
But as soon as one uses their spiritual power,

185
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,310
the spells immediately appear,

186
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:59,830
making it look like a possession.

187
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,030
Mr. Tanghua,

188
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,630
the fluid of this Tiankui insect,

189
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,690
when applied to the body,

190
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,920
will only disappear on its own after 10 days.

191
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,630
As 10 days haven't passed yet,

192
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,570
whether it's real or fake,

193
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,240
we'll know with one test.

194
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,430
You still dare to deny it?

195
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:30,630
You're treacherous and cunning.

196
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,310
How do I know if you're not planning to harm me?

197
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:33,670
Why should I surrender

198
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:34,670
and let you do as you please?

199
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:41,410
Stop!

200
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:06,710
Let me down quickly!

201
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:07,940
You crazy old woman!

202
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,140
Get away!

203
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:19,830
Don't move.

204
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:20,790
It stinks!

205
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:21,840
-Don’t touch me! 
-Don't move.

206
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:23,350
Don't move.

207
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,030
It'll be done soon.

208
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:25,910
What are you drawing?

209
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,120
What is this thing?

210
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,400
It'll be done soon.

211
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,230
What is this thing?

212
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:32,550
Crazy old woman!

213
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,510
-It’s done.
-What did you do?

214
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:36,990
What did you do?

215
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:37,990
Beautiful.

216
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:39,270
What did you do?

217
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:42,990
Don't go!

218
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,220
Let me down!

219
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:46,900
Tanghua!

220
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:48,270
It really is you.

221
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:50,550
Tanghua, how dare you?

222
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:52,610
So what if it's me?

223
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:53,750
Tanghua,

224
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:56,510
you've disappointed me greatly.

225
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:57,710
Tell me,

226
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:00,870
is this entirely your doing,

227
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:02,740
or is someone else behind this?

228
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,390
One bears the consequences of one's own actions.

229
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,510
Everything was done by me alone.

230
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:07,670
Chiyi and Xiazhi

231
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,310
were merely deceived by me.

232
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,470
Why did you do this?

233
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:12,790
Why?

234
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:15,870
Why?

235
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,230
You ask me why?

236
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,350
Lord Wenying,

237
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,100
you were once the deputy commander of the secret division.

238
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:23,030
In the battle of Xiangma Pass,

239
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,070
Without the High Priest,

240
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:25,990
would you still be alive

241
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,310
to speak so shamelessly here?

242
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,780
Your son, Shuofeng,

243
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,080
was kidnapped by the War Demon.

244
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:32,310
It was High Priest who attempted three rescues,

245
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:33,750
cutting through the camp of the War Demons

246
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,150
to save him.

247
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,350
How come

248
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:37,710
after only 60 years,

249
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,190
you've become so forgetful?

250
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:40,750
Have you forgotten everything?

251
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,150
And you,

252
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,870
when Bianshui was surrounded,

253
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,630
High Priest alone covered the retreat,

254
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:46,440
saving the entire army

255
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,200
and everyone's lives.

256
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,910
What did you all say then?

257
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:53,020
"We'll honor him as our master and serve him for life."

258
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,430
And now, you don't remember

259
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:56,510
a single word?

260
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,960
I know why you're like this.

261
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:02,070
Your wife

262
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:03,550
died in the battle of Pinghu.

263
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,270
You've always held a grudge,

264
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:07,310
thinking it was the High Priest

265
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,710
who failed to protect her.

266
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,320
But that was an accident.

267
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,910
Even gods can make mistakes.

268
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,310
Why can't he?

269
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:15,670
You people

270
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,520
are ungrateful and disloyal!

271
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,110
How dare you reside on Fangwai Mountain

272
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,470
and receive offerings from thousands?

273
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,350
Enough!

274
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,870
Tanghua.

275
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,140
Tell me,

276
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:29,910
was the possession your doing?

277
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,070
Indeed it was.

278
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,190
Very well.

279
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:33,910
As a general of the War Division,

280
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,150
you knowingly broke the law.

281
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,830
I have no choice but to deal with you.

282
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,270
As for any grievances

283
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,030
or resentments you may have,

284
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,030
we'll discuss them at the Law Enforcement Hall.

285
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,000
Guards!

286
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:43,870
Yes, sir!

287
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,470
Take Tanghua away.

288
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,230
Yes, sir.

289
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:47,150
Wait.

290
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:55,070
Are you going to punish him?

291
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,230
He committed a serious crime.

292
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:59,510
Without punishment, we can't appease the dead.

293
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:00,630
Then,

294
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,630
I want to take his punishment.

295
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:03,110
Is that possible?

296
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:03,910
No, it's not.

297
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,720
High Priest, what did you say?

298
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:08,390
I said,

299
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,430
I want to take his punishment.

300
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:12,390
You want to take his punishment.

301
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,630
Is that really true?

302
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:16,030
After all,

303
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,580
this all started because of me.

304
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,750
Tanghua committed this grave mistake

305
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:22,510
because of me.

306
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,230
As the High Priest,

307
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:26,790
and someone aspiring to become a god,

308
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,460
I should take responsibility for this.

309
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,550
You'll take his punishment?

310
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:34,270
That sounds so noble.

311
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:35,990
In fact, you've known all along.

312
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,590
You're the one who did this,

313
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:38,340
aren't you?

314
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,230
Your physical body isn't here.

315
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:44,030
With just your spirit, you're no match for me.

316
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,600
Tanyin, I don't want to hurt you.

317
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:46,750
But Taihe is in imminent danger.

318
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:47,950
I can't wait any longer.

319
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,030
Stay here for now.

320
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,000
Once we have a result,

321
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,190
I'll naturally let you go.

322
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:52,830
Forgive me, Hannv.

323
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:54,640
Drought Dragon!

324
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,470
Stop her!

325
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:53,630
I don't understand what you're

326
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:54,630
talking about.

327
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:57,230
Stop pretending.

328
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:58,670
If my guess is correct,

329
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:01,150
you knew everything about the fake possession.

330
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:02,550
You took advantage of the situation

331
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:04,310
and tricked Tanghua and others to their deaths.

332
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:05,780
You just wanted us to believe

333
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,540
that the War Demons had returned

334
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,670
to scare those fools

335
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,550
into voluntarily removing

336
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,870
the golden hoop from your neck.

337
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,190
Am I right?

338
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,390
It's quite a clever scheme.

339
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:19,070
Too bad you can fool them,

340
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:20,340
but you can't fool me.

341
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:22,990
I'll say it again,

342
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:25,230
I don't understand what you're talking about.

343
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,190
Fine.

344
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,470
You don't understand.

345
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:29,430
Alright.

346
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:31,710
Then take your time to figure it out.

347
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,430
Take Tanghua, the traitor, away.

348
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:35,870
Let go!

349
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,190
I know.

350
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:38,430
High Priest, you want to

351
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:39,830
take the punishment for Tanghua

352
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:41,190
to share the guilt.

353
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,300
But that's not possible.

354
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:44,910
Because you're also suspected

355
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,190
of being involved in the rebellion.

356
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,360
Grand Elder, what makes you say that?

357
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,630
Am I wrong?

358
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,690
You've practiced for years without progress.

359
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,550
Seeing no hope of becoming a god,

360
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:57,530
you want to remove the golden hoop, right?

361
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,140
But if you don't want to become a god,

362
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,270
just say it outright.

363
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:02,030
We can't force you, can we?

364
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,470
How could you commit such a bloodshed

365
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:04,670
and take their lives?

366
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:05,830
You're talking nonsense!

367
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:07,790
It seems

368
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:09,550
your mind is indeed not firm.

369
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,140
This is why

370
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,790
you can't ascend.

371
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:13,310
High Priest,

372
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,710
considering your years of service,

373
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:17,200
I can overlook

374
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,830
your fault of indulgence and instigation.

375
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,990
But Chiyi and Xiazhi

376
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:22,150
cannot die in vain.

377
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:23,110
From today,

378
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:25,230
the High Priest will be imprisoned

379
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:27,270
in the secret chamber inside Tianqu Peak

380
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,510
to reflect in seclusion.

381
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:30,790
Dingxu! Don't use this as an excuse.

382
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,260
All of this was done by me alone.

383
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,390
It has nothing to do with Yuanzhong.

384
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,070
If you want to blame someone, blame only me!

385
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:38,440
High Priest,

386
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,310
do you have any objections?

387
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,030
No,

388
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,030
I'm just a bit worried.

389
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,230
Worried about what?

390
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:56,300
Are you really sure

391
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:58,620
that all the War Demons are dead?

392
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,350
Help!

393
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:01,110
Don't move.

394
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,390
As long as you don't move,

395
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,150
I'll just take a little blood

396
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:06,790
to perform a spell.

397
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:09,470
My aim is precise,

398
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:11,910
you won't die.

399
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,349
If they're not dead,

400
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:17,990
will you come begging for my help again?

401
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:22,589
Will I agree then?

402
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:25,069
I'm afraid you'll have to

403
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:26,869
all kneel and kowtow to me

404
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:31,270
for me to consider it.

405
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,340
Hatred is also an obsession.

406
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,970
High Priest, you've broken your vows again.

407
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:40,210
The Youhu Clan has tens of thousands of folks.

408
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,780
Everyone cultivates immortality and seeks the Way.

409
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,110
The War Division has thousands of generals.

410
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,310
Their fighting power is extraordinary.

411
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:46,270
There has never been anyone in this world

412
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,990
who can't survive without someone else.

413
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:49,310
Besides, the War Demons have

414
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,230
long since died out.

415
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:51,750
Didn't you say those words

416
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:52,850
yourself?

417
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:57,550
I said it.

418
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:00,230
Sheng Xiang.

419
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,170
Yes.

420
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,310
Escort High Priest to Tianqu Peak.

421
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:04,550
Assign extra guards to watch over him.

422
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,470
There must be no mishaps.

423
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,540
Understood.

424
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,640
Take good care of the High Priest.

425
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:11,030
You must...

426
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:15,480
Where was I?

427
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,230
Dingxu?

428
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:17,870
Dingxu!

429
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:18,540
My head...

430
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,150
What's wrong?

431
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:20,950
Grand Elder.

432
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:21,830
Dingxu.

433
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:23,120
My head hurts.

434
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:28,420
The Ghost Ancestor of Yin, the Lord of the Tombs.

435
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,350
With the blood of battles, I drive the spirits of war.

436
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,030
I forsake my body, capture my soul.

437
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:34,110
Sever my hatred, slaughter my enemies.

438
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:36,470
The Ghost Ancestor of Yin, the Lord of the Tombs.

439
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:38,390
With the blood of battles, I drive the spirits of war.

440
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:40,150
I forsake my body, capture my soul.

441
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:42,430
Sever my hatred, slaughter my enemies.

442
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,470
The Ghost Ancestor of Yin, the Lord of the Tombs.

443
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:46,510
With the blood of battles, I drive the spirits of war.

444
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:48,310
I forsake my body, capture my soul.

445
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:50,350
Sever my hatred, slaughter my enemies.

446
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:57,720
This... This is...

447
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,010
It's the possession.

448
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:03,470
Grand Elder.

449
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:05,420
Grand Elder.

450
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,580
Dingxu, you bastard.

451
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:13,390
I'll kill you with my own hands today,

452
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,790
to avenge my late husband.

453
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:17,590
Stop!

454
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,930
Zi Fei, save him!

455
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:59,630
Since you're seeking death,

456
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:02,390
I'll kill you all first.

457
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,310
Little Yuanzhong,

458
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:12,300
it's you.

459
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:13,790
Who are you?

460
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:14,830
Me?

461
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,310
I am Granny Gu.

462
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:18,980
I've never heard of you.

463
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,270
You've never heard of me?

464
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:21,670
You've never heard of me?

465
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:22,880
You all killed my husband

466
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,200
and my son.

467
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,400
You're a War Demon?

468
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,310
Of course.

469
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:29,230
I am a War Demon.

470
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,620
We are the divine race.

471
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:32,430
You bunch of ants,

472
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,070
I'll kill you all.

473
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:38,950
Yuanzhong.

474
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:46,390
Ji Tanyin.

475
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:47,500
Ji Tanyin.

476
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:50,990
Qian Lin.

477
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:53,110
Don't worry about me now.

478
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:54,070
Stop her quickly!

479
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:56,020
The Ghost Ancestor of Yin, the Lord of the Tombs.

480
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:57,710
I'm going to slaughter you all.

481
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:08,910
Ji Tanyin.

482
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:09,830
Ji Tanyin.

483
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:13,510
Who allowed you to come here?

484
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,190
Luckily...

485
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:17,310
What did you say?

486
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:19,620
Luckily I made it in time.

487
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:27,820
Ji Tanyin.

488
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:29,030
Ji Tanyin.

489
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:42,910
Kneel.

490
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:43,740
Kneel.

491
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:45,830
Clan Leader.

492
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:51,610
All of you, leave first.

493
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,310
Let's go.

494
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,880
A little bit more.

495
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,300
I was so close!

496
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,040
[Chief of the Demon Clan, Li Chaoyang]

497
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:15,710
You performed the possessing technique?

498
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,070
Yes.

499
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:20,350
On whom?

500
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,050
Someone from the Youhu Clan.

501
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,350
His name is Dingxu.

502
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:27,030
Do you know him?

503
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:28,630
Are you aware that

504
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:31,400
exposing our clan's existence without permission

505
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:33,980
is a sin that will get your heart crushed and tongue ripped out?

506
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:36,690
I was so close!

507
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:38,990
How did you manage to do it?

508
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:43,430
It is the guidance from god.

509
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:44,870
She told me

510
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,930
she would help me seek revenge.

511
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:49,590
Clan Leader,

512
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:51,270
this old woman has gone mad.

513
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:54,870
You don't trust me?

514
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:57,310
I'll find it and show you.

515
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,090
Send someone to keep an eye on her.

516
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,050
Yes.

517
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:05,340
Found it.

518
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:06,590
Found it.

519
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:08,590
It's here.

520
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,350
This is our god.

521
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:20,390
Oh, dear god.

522
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,870
Reveal your presence.

523
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:25,590
Reveal your presence.

524
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,350
[Demon Clan, Shiren]

525
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:29,430
The god has revealed their presence!

526
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:31,190
The god has revealed their presence!

527
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,200
The god has revealed their presence!

528
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:36,590
Why did the godly light disappear?

529
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:37,820
This often happens.

530
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,230
Oh god, please reveal your presence quickly.

531
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,770
Reveal your presence quickly.

532
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:43,030
From now on,

533
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:44,290
watch over this shrine carefully.

534
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:46,210
I've always done so.

535
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,470
You stay.

536
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:49,350
Report immediately if there is any unusual activity.

537
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:50,160
Clan Leader,

538
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,790
this old woman is just a lunatic.

539
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:52,710
Why would you take her words

540
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:53,590
to heart?

541
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:54,670
No.

542
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,010
When I was young,

543
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:58,350
I saw my father conversing with the god.

544
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,110
I know

545
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:02,290
the god has always been here.

546
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:25,390
Elder Xinyao,

547
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:28,190
we all have been kneeling here for a long time.

548
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:29,670
I wonder what the High Priest

549
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:30,660
is having in mind.

550
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:33,750
How about you go in and sound him out?

551
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:36,630
If you really can't be patient,

552
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,470
you might as well go in yourself and ask.

553
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:07,740
Xinyao and the Council of Elders

554
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,060
have been kneeling outside the whole night.

555
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:11,390
Tanghua has been locked up.

556
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:12,270
The War Division is leaderless

557
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,230
and in complete chaos.

558
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:14,070
In fact, Baili Xiang

559
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:15,390
is now the Commander of the War Division.

560
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,400
Yuanzhong, the rest are all frightened.

561
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:18,720
This is the perfect opportunity.

562
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:21,990
Yuanzhong.

563
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:25,590
Why?

564
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:27,750
Why did she come?

565
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,110
Perhaps she heard about

566
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,290
what happened with the Council of Elders

567
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:33,110
and came out of concern for you.

568
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:33,870
What I meant is,

569
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:36,190
why would she

570
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:37,430
approach me?

571
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,310
Don't you find it strange?

572
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:43,310
Why would a highly skilled craftsman like her

573
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:45,790
be willing to approach me

574
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:47,630
to be my maid?

575
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,470
I originally thought she had some ulterior motive.

576
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:52,750
Perhaps,

577
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:55,150
she was a spy

578
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:56,510
sent by one of the elders,

579
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:58,750
or a scout from the human race.

580
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,580
Another possibility is that

581
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:02,070
she held a grudge against me.

582
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:04,910
Maybe someone in her clan

583
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,250
had died in Pinghu,

584
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:09,150
and she was raised since young to seek revenge.

585
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:12,350
But she suddenly died like this,

586
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:22,270
so suddenly.

587
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:26,070
Don't you find it strange?

588
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:27,160
What scheme could

589
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,480
a dead person have?

590
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:32,000
Could it be that she has an extraordinary identity,

591
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:34,200
and the human race would use her death

592
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,350
to stir up trouble?

593
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:38,160
I've checked. Her background is clean.

594
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:40,470
Then why did she die?

595
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:42,910
This is suspicious.

596
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,300
It doesn't make sense.

597
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:47,990
How could she die so suddenly?

598
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:49,160
Maybe,

599
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:51,270
she genuinely liked you.

600
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:52,470
Just as she said,

601
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:53,790
she thought you were a good person

602
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:57,310
and hoped you live a long and peaceful life.

603
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:01,670
Impossible.

604
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:03,510
Absolutely impossible.

605
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:04,950
Anyway,

606
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:06,830
the dead can't be brought back to life.

607
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:08,640
We have ployed for so long,

608
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,190
now is not the time to be distracted.

609
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:11,510
Yuanzhong,

610
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,430
you need to pull yourself together.

611
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,190
Where's Dingxu?

612
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:18,710
I haven't seen him.

613
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:21,820
Then there's no rush yet.

614
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,030
Grand Elder,

615
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:44,350
here's the medicine.

616
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,110
Grand Elder,

617
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:01,110
what's really going on?

618
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:02,760
Wasn't the possessing technique fake?

619
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:03,740
Wasn't it all a trick

620
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:04,470
by Tanghua and the others?

621
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:05,670
They were acting this whole time?

622
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:07,110
But how come you...

623
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,110
This shouldn't be happening.

624
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:15,230
Where are Xinyao and the other Elders?

625
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,110
Those spineless cowards

626
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:17,990
all went to the Liujiao Palace

627
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:19,220
to kneel and beg the High Priest.

628
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,510
They haven't been seen since.

629
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:26,390
Grand Elder,

630
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:29,110
the War Demons have returned,

631
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:30,470
haven't they?

632
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:42,310
What do we do with these things?

633
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:43,340
They're useless now.

634
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:44,790
Just burn them.

635
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:46,390
What a shame to burn them.

636
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:48,030
When I have time, I'll make a trip to Gushan

637
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:48,670
and deliver these things

638
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:50,030
to the old woman,

639
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:52,070
so that she makes Dingxu experience the possesion every year.

640
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:53,150
Make him suffer again.

641
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:55,150
He might not live

642
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:56,750
to experience another birthday.

643
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:57,740
That's true.

644
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,510
The sinner, Dingxu,

645
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:21,070
have come to break the High Priest's seal.

646
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:25,450
High Priest, please open the door and meet us.

647
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:46,220
Greetings, High Priest.

648
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:49,990
The War Demons have returned.

649
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:53,270
We humbly request the High Priest to let go of past grievances

650
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:55,430
for the greater good,

651
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:57,310
and lead the entire clan to resist the War Demons,

652
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:00,580
after the seal has been broken,

653
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:03,240
to ensure our clan's heavenly fortune

654
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:06,430
can be passed on immortally.

655
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:08,310
Very well.

656
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:18,460
Yuanzhong, I'm old now.

657
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:21,670
I don't have many days left to live.

658
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:24,230
From now on, Youhu Clan

659
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:27,030
can only rely on you.

660
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:30,550
Sure.

661
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:32,720
Do...

662
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:35,910
Do you have anything

663
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:38,170
to say to me?

664
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:48,030
Yuanzhong,

665
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:53,230
I've watched you grow up after all.

666
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,310
Everything I've done

667
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:57,990
is all for

668
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:59,790
our Youhu Clan.

669
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,630
I suddenly remember

670
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:04,860
that there's still something to ask.

671
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:07,550
Go ahead.

672
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:09,630
Ask it.

673
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:11,190
Will you be removing

674
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,060
the golden hoop today?

675
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:27,820
Yes.

676
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:32,830
Then let's begin.

677
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:35,440
Alright.

678
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:29,500
Everyone,

679
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:31,870
it's been long.

680
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:44,070
You've finally woken up.

681
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,580
What... What happened to me?

682
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:53,260
Your primordial spirit was summoned back by the Gate of Heaven

683
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:54,410
and your divine power has been greatly weakened.

684
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:55,550
If it weren't for Hannv

685
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:57,190
casting healing spells on you

686
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:58,680
to stabilize your primordial spirit,

687
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,910
you would have lost

688
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:02,990
a hundred years of cultivation.

689
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,080
Thank you, Hannv.

690
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:06,500
What happened?

691
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:10,070
The situation

692
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:12,270
was a bit complicated.

693
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:15,230
Anyway, I just

694
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:17,350
got beaten till death.

695
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:18,870
You're a god, aren't you?

696
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:20,630
You were beaten till death?

697
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:22,909
The opponent was also very powerful.

698
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:25,550
Besides, I'm just the God of Craftsmanship.

699
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,230
My magic is on the average

700
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:29,230
and my magical powers are limited in the mortal realm.

701
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:32,429
Also, when I descended to the mortal realm,

702
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:34,440
I went through the Sea of Flux.

703
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:36,110
My physical body was severely damaged.

704
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:37,960
Even now,

705
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:40,389
it hasn't fully recovered yet.

706
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:41,710
The High Priest of Youhu Clan

707
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:42,630
doing?

708
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:45,030
Hannv,

709
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:47,389
you knew he would be in danger,

710
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:49,030
so you intentionally summoned me back,

711
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:49,840
didn't you?

712
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:52,020
I have followers in the mortal realm.

713
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:53,429
I vaguely know some things,

714
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:54,550
but I'm not sure

715
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:55,870
what exactly is happening.

716
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,990
Whatever happens,

717
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:59,470
it is his destiny.

718
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:00,790
You are a god.

719
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:02,140
You shouldn't be involved in it.

720
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:06,540
I need to go back now.

721
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:11,830
You think you just took a nap?

722
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:14,110
Your primordial spirit was beaten out of your body.

723
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:16,150
If you don't rest properly,

724
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:18,070
your future cultivation will be affected.

725
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:19,510
But my physical body

726
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:20,590
is still down there.

727
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:21,790
You have so many magical artifacts with you,

728
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:22,790
you can just keep an eye on it.

729
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:24,950
You can rush back if there's danger, it isn't too late.

730
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,580
Peace, joy, and prosperity to all.

731
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:16,910
What's wrong?

732
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:19,840
Nothing.

733
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,950
If it's nothing, why are you

734
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:21,710
clutching your chest?

735
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:26,910
My chest just feels a little tight.

736
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:28,590
I've told you, your primordial spirit is damaged

737
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:30,030
and needs proper rest.

738
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:31,790
Why? You still want to go back?

739
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:34,150
Stop wasting time, control you breath and stabilize your condition.

740
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:48,150
Yuanzhong.

741
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:49,470
Tanghua is here.

742
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:52,350
Let's bury her.

743
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,190
The view from my Liujiao Palace is nice, isn't it?

744
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,190
I think you have never been here before.

745
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,830
I came here the day Chiyi died.

746
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:16,870
I had forgotten about that.

747
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:21,030
Your seal has been broken?

748
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:22,110
Yes.

749
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:24,350
Regarding our plan for the possession,

750
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,750
were you aware about it all along?

751
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:28,750
I was.

752
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:29,990
Then why did you...

753
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:34,990
Did I what?

754
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,310
Why did I not stop you?

755
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:39,790
Weren't you trying to save me?

756
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:41,830
How could I ruin your plan?

757
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:47,430
Tanghua,

758
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:50,350
why are you still like this?

759
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:52,830
If you're going to do something, do it decisively.

760
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:55,190
If you're going to take a side, do it thoroughly.

761
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:57,150
If you're so hesitant

762
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,430
and indecisive,

763
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:00,230
how can you be the Commander of the War Division?

764
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:01,550
I haven't taken any side.

765
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:02,750
Back then, I did it for...

766
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:03,480
A handmaiden from my Liujiao Palace

767
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,030
has just died.

768
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,710
My mood right now

769
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:08,710
is very bad.

770
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:10,500
Stop saying things

771
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,390
that will make me unhappy,

772
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:20,470
especially right now.

773
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:49,950
What did you promise me back then?

774
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:51,710
If it happens again,

775
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:53,320
I will take your life.

776
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,790
I am finding someone.

777
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:56,470
I don't care who you're looking for.

778
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:58,070
I advise that

779
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,270
you give up this idea as soon as possible.

780
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,870
My clan's whereabouts have been exposed.

781
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,110
There might be a war soon.

782
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:06,750
If you don't sharpen your skills,

783
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,030
you'll end up dead sooner or later.

784
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,560
I am looking for my mother.

785
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:12,550
Her name is Su Niang.

786
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:14,630
Someone said she lives in Gushan Town.

787
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:21,920
You better take care of yourself first.

788
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:34,870
You're leaving?

789
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:37,030
There's no need to lie to me.

790
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:37,670
When I passed by you room

791
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:38,760
this morning,

792
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,060
I saw you packing your bags.

793
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:43,670
Even if I'm leaving,

794
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:45,510
it isn't a big deal, is it?

795
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:47,030
Of course it isn't for others,

796
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:48,350
but I am happy for you

797
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:49,790
that you're leaving.

798
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:52,510
We've known each other for many years.

799
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:53,780
Don't I know you well?

800
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:56,030
We all consider Youhu Clan

801
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:57,350
as a sacred place for cultivation,

802
00:39:57,950 --> 00:40:00,070
but you don't care at all.

803
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:02,060
For you,

804
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:04,150
this place feels more like a prison.

805
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:06,270
It bounds you and took away your freedom.

806
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:08,910
If you ask me, I think you should have left long ago.

807
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:11,430
I've just figured out some things.

808
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,830
If you're going to leave, do it now.

809
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:14,790
Delay may bring changes.

810
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:16,140
Can we go out now?

811
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:18,870
The lockdown has been lifted.

812
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:20,390
Everything is now back to normal.

813
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:23,270
However, the defensive spells everywhere

814
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:24,230
have not been deactivated.

815
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:26,150
What exactly happened?

816
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:28,190
We were confined here for days

817
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:29,390
and weren't even allowed to leave our rooms.

818
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:30,870
I don't know either

819
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:33,030
and I advise you not to ask too much.

820
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:34,790
The atmosphere has been off lately.

821
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:36,390
The leaders from all mountains have gathered.

822
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:37,070
Yesterday, they collectively

823
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:38,430
went to the Liujiao Palace to kneel and worship.

824
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:40,870
I guess someone must have made a mistake

825
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:42,070
and angered the High Priest.

826
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:44,180
How is Mr. Tanghua now?

827
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:46,110
He has returned to the Jinxia Palace.

828
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:47,610
Oh, right.

829
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:49,950
I heard someone in the Liujiao Palace died.

830
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:51,710
Who?

831
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:53,430
A human-race handmaiden

832
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:54,750
called Ji Tanyin.

833
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:03,390
You're back.

834
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:06,440
Where is Ji Tanyin buried?

835
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:08,040
She's still in the room.

836
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:09,750
Didn't I tell you to bury her properly?

837
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:11,150
Why is she still in my room?

838
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:12,230
Well, I was

839
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:13,230
preparing the things

840
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:14,550
to make it more dignified for her.

841
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:15,350
It's been a whole day

842
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:16,790
and you still haven't gotten this one task done?

843
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:19,790
I haven't been doing nothing.

844
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:21,840
What are these?

845
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,510
These are all the burial goods

846
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:24,750
prepared for Ji Tanyin.

847
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:26,870
We have these in the Liujiao Palace?

848
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:28,150
Is there anything in the whole Fangwai Mountain

849
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:29,710
that I can't obtain if I want it?

850
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,110
Yuanzhong,

851
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:33,190
come with me, will you?

852
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:35,450
Funerals of the human race are particular that

853
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:36,830
the more people attending the funeral,

854
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:37,910
the more dignified the deceased.

855
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:39,230
If it's just me alone,

856
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,470
she'll seem too pitiful.

857
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:31,470
Which one should I choose?

858
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:35,790
Which one should I choose?

859
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:39,190
What do you mean?
