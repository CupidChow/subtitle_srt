[A Moment But Forever]

00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:47,190
[Episode 32]

3
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:48,950
Your eyes

4
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,310
are just temporary blind.

5
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:56,310
When I was at Tianqu Peak,

6
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:57,590
I could only see

7
00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:00,790
a small patch

8
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,590
of the sky when I looked up.

9
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,520
At that time, I thought

10
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,590
that after I got out,

11
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:10,199
I had to take a good look at the stars.

12
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,360
I didn't expect

13
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,470
that when I really got out,

14
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,520
I didn't feel like

15
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,120
stargazing anymore.

16
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,150
Look over there.

17
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,000
It's the Maiden constellation.

18
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,120
It's shaped like a basket

19
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:32,940
and looks like the character "woman."

20
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,720
And there.

21
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,630
Those five are the Lizhu constellation.

22
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,240
Its appearance

23
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,400
is like a backward bowl.

24
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,040
♫Listening♫

25
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:45,329
♫Toona leaves knock fireflies into a vase♫

26
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:48,320
♫Ripples faintly spreading♫

27
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,480
♫In the pavilion in the clouds♫

28
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,470
♫Warm wine brews to the sound of the zither♫

29
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:57,130
♫The fragrance lingers like brush strokes, sketching out your form♫

30
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,010
♫Tonight♫

31
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:03,030
♫In a light intoxication, I feel the longing in the crystalline snow♫

32
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,910
♫I cannot bear to think of you♫

33
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,930
♫I only wish♫

34
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,790
♫That the years would remain ever sunny♫

35
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:14,360
♫So that, within the drifting light, I could share the breeze with you♫

36
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:15,950
♫The wind blows♫

37
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,370
♫It stirs the scenery♫

38
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:19,120
♫It awakens our heart♫

39
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:22,790
♫It makes me certain that you are my destiny♫

40
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:24,660
♫The closer we get♫

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,280
I wish time

42
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,290
♫The more it feels like a dream♫

43
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,680
♫And the more I look intoxicated♫

44
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,840
can stop at this moment.

45
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:32,020
♫I cannot fully express my yearning for you♫

46
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,150
♫The wind blows♫

47
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:34,570
♫It stirs the scenery♫

48
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,320
♫It awakens our heart♫

♫It makes me certain that you are my destiny♫

♫The closer we get♫

00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,490
♫The more it feels like a dream♫

00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:49,230
♫I cannot fully express my yearning for you♫

54
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,360
♫The wind blows♫

55
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,140
♫It blows away the shadows of the clouds♫

56
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,840
♫It makes the moon seem even brighter♫

57
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:58,040
♫It makes me wake up from a dream♫

58
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,290
♫The wind blows♫

59
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,910
♫It reddens my eyes♫

60
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,940
♫It warms the promise we made♫

61
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:06,570
♫In the wind, we gently♫

62
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,280
♫Drift into a better place♫

63
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,750
There's a shabby temple ahead.

64
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,630
We can rest there.

65
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,190
You're tired?

66
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,980
Zhi Dai, are you tired?

67
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,190
Even if you're not, the horse is.

68
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:28,870
I know you are anxious.

69
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,120
I am too.

70
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,310
Please listen advice occasionally,

71
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,360
Young Master Tanghua.

72
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,530
How can we search when we're all tired?

73
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,600
Let's go.

74
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,690
Embroidery God Temple?

75
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,040
What's wrong?

76
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:21,430
Nothing.

77
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:25,920
It's safe here.

78
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,430
I'll find some hay to feed the horses.

79
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,170
Zhi Dai.

80
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,870
You look a little dazed.

81
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,890
Are you tired?

82
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,310
A bit.

83
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,040
It's my fault.

84
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,630
I was busy searching

85
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,230
and forgot your cultivation.

86
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,060
It's time to rest.

87
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,320
Here.

88
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,540
Good. This mat can be used.

89
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,360
Although it's a bit shabby,

90
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,630
it's better than nothing.

91
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:13,750
Zhi Dai,

92
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,420
take a rest.

93
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,720
I’ll go hunt some wild game.

94
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,160
I’ll tell Qian Lin

95
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,430
not to disturb you.

96
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,750
Have a good rest.

97
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,070
Okay.

98
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,370
It's been years.

99
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:35,920
How does it feel to be young?

100
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:40,480
Goddess of Embroidery.

101
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,920
You still remember me? Not bad.

102
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,310
You've helped me a lot.

103
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,159
All these years,

104
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,750
I've prayed and worshipped you.

105
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:56,720
I never dared to forget, even for one day.

106
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,250
That's good.

107
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:00,440
Do you remember

108
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:01,800
what I told you

109
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,240
when you begged me

110
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,190
to give you youth?

111
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,070
I told you,

112
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,630
"A god won't bestow blessings

113
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,040
upon a useless person.

114
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,820
Instead of kneeling down to me,

115
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,070
why don't you make a deal with me?"

116
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:15,950
Now,

117
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,430
it's time for you

118
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,000
to complete the deal.

119
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:14,350
You can see now?

120
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,740
You can see now?

121
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,680
You can see now,

122
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,560
right, Yuanzhong?

123
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:25,410
Maybe I've recovered.

124
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,600
Great.

125
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,510
Can you leave now?

126
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:30,780
I'll pack your luggage.

127
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:33,740
Do you really want us to leave?

128
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,789
No.

129
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,799
Didn't you say that you only came

130
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,120
to recuperate

131
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,440
and will leave after he's recovered?

132
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:43,840
Yuanzhong not only has an eye injury,

133
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,910
but also a knife injury.

134
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,150
He's still injured.

135
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,150
A knife injury?

136
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,960
You got quite a lot of injuries.

137
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,390
Yes.

138
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,270
So, we might need to

139
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,840
trouble you for a while longer.

140
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,240
Fine.

141
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,020
I'm not an unreasonable person.

142
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:06,890
You're injured.

143
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:08,330
Take a good rest.

144
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,720
Yuanzhong's injury

145
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:25,840
needs some more time

146
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,960
to recover.

147
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,870
Now that the celestial ladder has been destroyed,

148
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,510
and the Ascension Platform was sealed,

149
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,600
the only passage between the human and deity realms

150
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,200
is the Sea of Flux.

151
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,150
That's a place beyond the boundaries.

152
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,660
It's extremely dangerous.

153
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,350
Now that I've lost my divine bone,

154
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,000
it's even harder.

155
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:44,400
I need a perfect plan.

156
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,320
Spatial Spell!

157
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,150
Juanjuan?

158
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,230
Juanjuan.

159
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,320
There's no one in the room.

160
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,610
No one?

161
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,120
What a pity.

162
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,910
I made a table of delicious dishes,

163
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,080
but there's no one to eat it.

164
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:29,930
What delicious dishes?

165
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:31,270
Let me see.

166
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:33,440
Wasn't there no one here?

167
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,290
Now there is one,

168
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,670
okay?

169
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,390
It's so delicious.

170
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,080
How can you

171
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,240
cook so well?

172
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:46,630
Eat slowly.

173
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,880
Have some water.

174
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,410
A little.

175
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,340
Your craftsmanship is so good.

176
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,480
I didn't expect you

177
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,360
to be so good at cooking too.

178
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:01,510
I thought

179
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:02,720
your cooking skills

180
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,890
are similar to mine.

181
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,550
I used to be at your level,

182
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:07,600
but

183
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:08,600
to become

184
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,750
Yuanzhong's handmaiden,

185
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,480
I trained hard for a long time.

186
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,910
I really don't understand

187
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,840
what you see in Yuanzhong.

188
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,150
I cook so well.

189
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,670
Do you want to learn from me?

190
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,510
Otherwise, when I leave,

191
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,240
you won't be able to

192
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,480
have so much delicious food.

193
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,270
But cooking is too troublesome.

194
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,360
It's not difficult at all.

195
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:33,790
You

196
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,390
cook to please Yuanzhong.

197
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,960
I don't have anyone to please.

198
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,120
What about pleasing yourself?

199
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:44,640
Forget it. I'll just be lazy.

200
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,120
Then,

201
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,790
do you want to learn craftsmanship from me?

202
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:54,530
I'm not bragging,

203
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,910
but my craftsmanship is the best in the three realms.

204
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:57,960
The best in the world.

205
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,200
Many people want me

206
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,320
to be their teacher.

207
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,360
But

208
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:03,360
I think you're very smart.

209
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:05,120
Why don't I take you as my disciple?

210
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:06,600
How about I teach you

211
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,230
all my amazing skills?

212
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,320
Do you need my help?

213
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,810
Just say it.

214
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:17,970
What is it?

215
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,890
Then I'll get straight to the point.

216
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,790
Go ahead.

217
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:25,910
Your Barrier Spell

218
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,790
is magic created with the rules

219
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,080
of heaven and earth.

220
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,840
So you came for this?

221
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,630
Yes.

222
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:34,650
Are you interested?

223
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,360
Yes.

224
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,600
Actually, I've learned

225
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,870
some spatial rules.

226
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,200
And through craftsmanship,

227
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:40,720
I've also grasped

228
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,390
how to change the size of space.

229
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,040
But now,

230
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,190
I need to go somewhere.

231
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:48,790
The environment there is extremely dangerous.

232
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:51,080
If I only have my knowledge of space,

233
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,670
I'm afraid it's not enough to pass.

234
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:53,630
So I want to learn

235
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:54,910
your Barrier Spell

236
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,000
to divide space

237
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,720
and reject external objects.

238
00:12:58,670 --> 00:12:59,590
I see.

239
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,030
But it's complicated.

240
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:09,120
Actually, the Barrier Spell,

241
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,000
put bluntly,

242
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,750
is just the method of space separation.

243
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,180
Everything is intertwined.

244
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,200
Even the laws of heaven and earth

245
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,270
are intertwined.

246
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,200
In fact, everywhere visible

247
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,240
to the naked eye

248
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,150
has undetectable spatial cracks

249
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:24,320
everywhere and at all times.

250
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,030
Is that so?

251
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,910
I think even

252
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,720
the dangerous place you mentioned

253
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,600
is the same.

254
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:39,670
Again.

255
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:40,870
It's almost done.

256
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,080
Don't mind it. Try again. Hurry.

257
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,390
Okay.

258
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,870
It's done!

259
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,740
Ji Tanyin, you did it!

260
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,480
How did you do it?

261
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,200
Try again.

262
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,200
Let me see.

263
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:02,910
Sure.

264
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,270
Awesome!

265
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,600
You're amazing!

266
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:16,910
Do you know

267
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:18,360
how long I practiced this?

268
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,870
I can't believe you

269
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:20,870
learned it immediately.

270
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,150
It's nothing.

271
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:23,360
No.

272
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:24,600
I just told you

273
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,720
my own understanding.

274
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,440
You learned so much

275
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,750
on your own.

276
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,240
I don't even know this.

277
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,550
You're…

278
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:33,140
You're just...

279
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:40,870
What's wrong?

280
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:41,790
The moon!

281
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:45,030
It's midnight.

282
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,750
What's wrong with the moon?

283
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,600
What's wrong? This is a huge problem!

284
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,320
I usually sleep

285
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,910
before midnight.

286
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,910
I've kept this habit for 10 years.

287
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:54,320
No, no.

288
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,630
I have to go to bed now.

289
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,550
Ji Tanyin,

290
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:58,600
goodbye.

291
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,840
Let's practice tomorrow.

292
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:00,760
Bye.

293
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:48,820
Time to go.

294
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:11,480
Still reading?

295
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,410
Eat something first.

296
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,569
I just made it.

297
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:15,440
Eat it while it's hot.

298
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:16,960
Okay.

299
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:21,390
The weather is nice today.

300
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:22,550
After dinner,

301
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:23,720
come take a walk.

302
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,000
It'll help you recover.

303
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,390
I picked it this morning.

304
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:30,130
It's fresh. Try it.

305
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:55,000
I think you should be

306
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,790
mostly recovered.

307
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,440
If you're almost recovered,

308
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,270
I plan on…

309
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,160
I plan on leaving.

310
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:28,680
How do you feel?

311
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,720
How did this happen?

312
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:58,200
Why is it getting worse?

313
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,400
Yes.

314
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,270
How long has it been?

315
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,740
It shouldn't be bleeding anymore.

316
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:03,480
Yuanzhong.

317
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,510
Did you move around again

318
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,590
and hurt your injury?

319
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,030
Why are you glaring at me?

320
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:08,980
I'm just caring for you.

321
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:11,830
Yuanzhong was hurt by the God-Slaying Dagger.

322
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,740
I had experienced this

323
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,170
when in the Demon Warriors’ hands.

324
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,910
I could feel an extremely strong

325
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:18,450
malicious aura on the blade.

326
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,120
Malicious aura?

327
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,510
Ordinary weapons

328
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:24,370
won't hurt Yuanzhong.

329
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,720
Thank you.

330
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:30,510
My injuries

331
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,200
hinder you.

332
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,720
I'm sorry.

333
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:35,640
Don't say sorry.

334
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,480
I should stay with you.

335
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,630
By the way,

336
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,250
where are you going?

337
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:45,920
How about

338
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,780
I go with you

339
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,720
after I'm better?

340
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,960
You should recuperate first.

341
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,350
No, I have a question.

342
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,160
Why

343
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,680
don't we get rid of the malicious aura

344
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,790
before healing the injury?

345
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,680
Do you have

346
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,110
medicine to remove the malicious aura?

347
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,480
Of course.

348
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:06,830
The War Demons' techniques

349
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:07,920
carry malice.

350
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,960
I hid a lot of

351
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,550
malice-removing medicine

352
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:10,920
before coming to live in seclusion.

353
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,680
This is the Vermillion Fruit.

354
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,730
It grows in the extremely hot region in the south

355
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,350
and feeds on the power of geothermal fire.

356
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:27,470
It is the natural enemy of malicious aura.

357
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,880
Can I eat this directly?

358
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:32,170
No.

359
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,510
You need to peel it

360
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:34,880
and separate the skin from the flesh.

361
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,880
Then boil it in water

362
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,240
for four hours

363
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,830
and smoke it.

364
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:41,100
After it dries, grind it into powder and mix with water.

365
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,160
Finally, you can consume it.

366
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,140
By the way,

367
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:47,560
everyone in the Youhu Clan

368
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,440
knows this method of countering malicious aura.

369
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,720
Didn't Yuanzhong tell you?

370
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,750
He probably forgot.

371
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,540
I think the water is boiling.

372
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,440
Should we

373
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,920
peel it first?

374
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,310
Yes.

375
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,550
After peeling, steaming, drying,

376
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:06,650
we'll grind it.

377
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,070
Then did we

378
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,030
boil the water

379
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,270
too soon?

380
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,480
It's okay.

381
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,390
It's warmer here if we boil the water.

382
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:21,350
Well,

383
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:23,100
let me peel it with you.

384
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:23,850
Sure.

385
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,200
I can't even choose the right time

386
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,350
to boil water.

387
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,070
Am I stupid?

388
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,270
No.

389
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,590
Everyone has things

390
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:33,920
we are not good at.

391
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,350
But I think

392
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:37,270
there's nothing

393
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,550
I'm good at,

394
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:39,750
Look.

395
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,680
Isn't creating medicine

396
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,920
something you are good at?

397
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,890
But I read it from books.

398
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:46,720
It's good

399
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,270
to like reading.

400
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,030
When I went to your room last time,

401
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:50,960
I saw you had

402
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,350
many good books.

403
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,000
Yuanzhong likes reading too.

404
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,830
When I was in the Liujiao Palace,

405
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,680
he always had a book in his hand.

406
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:06,940
Even now,

407
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,790
he can read

408
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:12,140
for a long time once he starts.

409
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,030
No matter what happens,

410
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,400
as long as there's a book,

411
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:18,890
he seems to be able to settle down.

412
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,640
I think

413
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:23,160
there are two kinds of people in this world.

414
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,160
One is

415
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,920
the type who likes to read quietly.

416
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,590
The other type

417
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,200
likes running around.

418
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:30,270
These aren't the only two types.

419
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:32,510
What about you?

420
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,920
Which type are you?

421
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,550
I used to like reading.

422
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,000
But later,

423
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,110
somehow,

424
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:44,480
I kept running around.

425
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,110
Maybe

426
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:47,920
I fell in love with running around.

427
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:52,340
You're going to run around again,

428
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,810
right?

429
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:57,590
I won't run around.

430
00:22:58,450 --> 00:22:59,170
I'm leaving.

431
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:03,640
I have my own matter

432
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,550
to handle.

433
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:05,940
If you leave,

434
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:08,160
Yuanzhong will be very sad.

435
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:12,550
I'll be back.

436
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:16,640
They all say so.

437
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,750
When people leave,

438
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:19,960
they always say

439
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,570
they'll come back.

440
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,920
But after they leave,

441
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,110
they never come back.

442
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:26,960
Some goodbyes

443
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:28,750
eventually turn permanent.

444
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:36,720
When the Youhu Clan and War Demons

445
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,790
were at war,

446
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,110
my family and friends

447
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:41,370
were all like this.

448
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,270
They never came back.

449
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,880
My family and friends

450
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,010
were Yuanzhong's family and friends.

451
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:50,830
What kind of person

452
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,240
was Yuanzhong?

453
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:56,750
Him?

454
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:58,250
When he was little,

455
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,590
he was very annoying.

456
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,270
So naughty

457
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:02,240
and mischievous.

458
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,640
He liked to prank people too.

459
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:05,310
He was the biggest troublemaker

460
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:07,270
in the whole mountain.

461
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:08,720
So noisy!

462
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,680
But then,

463
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:11,440
he got the Divine Left Hand,

464
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,530
so…

465
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,070
So what?

466
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:16,510
He became

467
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:18,030
even more annoying.

468
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:19,570
He was arrogant.

469
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,510
He thought he was great.

470
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:24,310
And after that,

471
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,920
he was sealed

472
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,830
and he changed completely.

473
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,000
Changed?

474
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:33,900
He became like a mannequin.

475
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,790
Did you see him later?

476
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,070
He said

477
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,590
you left after the two clans

478
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:41,510
declared war.

479
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,480
Actually,

480
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:45,350
I went back once.

481
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:46,550
But

482
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,400
I thought everyone had changed.

483
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,920
They'd become strangers,

484
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,650
so I left again.

485
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,720
But

486
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,270
this time,

487
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,790
I see you two together

488
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,590
and I think he's changed again.

489
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,270
He seems to have turned back

490
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:02,480
into the

491
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,070
annoying person.

492
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:05,680
But no matter what,

493
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,480
it's much better than that mannequin.

494
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:09,030
So,

495
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:10,200
don't let him

496
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,590
turn back into that mannequin again,

497
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:12,620
okay?

498
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,490
Have some medicine.

499
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:56,510
I'm leaving for a while.

500
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,880
I wanted to wait

501
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,200
until you recovered,

502
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,400
but it's been delayed too long.

503
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
There's no time.

504
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,470
Everything is fine here.

505
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:15,920
It's safe.

506
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:17,300
You can stay here

507
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,560
to recuperate in peace.

508
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:20,350
Juanjuan will also...

509
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:21,350
Where are you going?

510
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,720
I'm going home.

511
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,270
Something happened at home.

512
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,200
But it's fine.

513
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,200
Fortunately, some respected elders

514
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,790
of the clan are there.

515
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,200
With them there,

516
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,650
they will be fine.

517
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,720
As long as they think of

518
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:54,400
a solution,

519
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,350
it will be solved.

520
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,830
You need to wait for me.

521
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:02,160
Can't you be like before?

522
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:03,960
What?

523
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,510
Just like before

524
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,480
when you pretended to die,

525
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,030
without moving or speaking,

526
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,480
without a breath or pulse,

527
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,880
without consciousness,

528
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:17,350
and wake up after a while.

529
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:19,830
Can't you do that?

530
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,270
You promised me

531
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,930
you'll always be with me.

532
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:35,400
Does it still count?

533
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:37,510
Of course.

534
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:38,720
Then why are you leaving?

535
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:40,790
I'm just leaving for a while.

536
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:42,110
How long is "a while"?

537
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,400
Where are you going?

538
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:44,480
Where is your home?

539
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,160
Did something happen to you?

540
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,440
If you don't come back,

541
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,720
where can I find you?

542
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:50,240
If you are in danger,

543
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,350
how can I help you?

544
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,160
How long

545
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,800
must I wait for?

546
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,440
How long before you're back?

547
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,840
You want me to wait,

548
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,590
but do you know

549
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:09,510
how it feels

550
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:10,700
to wait for someone?

551
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,690
♫Going through thousands of years♫

552
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,920
Didn't you promise me

553
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,190
to be with me forever?

554
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:16,450
♫In exchange for a dreamlike love♫

555
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:14,480
To grow old with me,

556

until my hair grays,

557
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,310
my teeth fall out,

558
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:19,030
and I'm surrounded by descendants,

559
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,270
♫If the wind is all yours♫

560
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,920

♫No bitterness in your expression♫

562
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,720

♫Everyone comes without a match♫

564
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,750
Are you going back on your word?

565
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,190
No.

♫Why are they willing to be gentle?♫

567
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:30,810

Travel by water or land?

605
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,090
We'll know after asking.

606
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,700
Even though a tortoise lives long, its time still runs out.

607
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,960
It's the same with the enchantment technique.

608
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,110
It's almost time.

609
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,410
You're getting old again.

610
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:48,670
Aren't you afraid?

611
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:50,070
Besides,

612
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:51,790
even if you don't think for yourself,

613
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,550
you should think for your people.

614
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,880
You're now the City Lord of Yandu City.

615
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:57,070
You don't want them

616
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:58,400
to be punished

617
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,980
because you deceived the gods, right?

618
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:01,660
City Lord Dai,

619
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,780
a wise person submits to fate.

620
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:06,310
Do what I told you.

621
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,030
Zhi Dai.

622
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:09,400
What's wrong?

623
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:10,590
Nothing.

624
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,030
A man

625
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,440
about this tall.

626
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,310
The woman is very thin.

627
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,270
A man and a woman.

628
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,200
Let me guess.

629
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:23,160
Were they driving a carriage?

630
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:25,550
Such clear description.

631
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,400
Have you seen the people we're looking for?

632
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,240
You think too much.

633
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:30,550
Haven't seen them.

634
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:31,960
No?

635
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:33,830
Then why do you know it so well?

636
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:35,560
How can I not know?

637
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,750
Are you kids

638
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:38,480
going to kill the demons too?

639
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:41,680
How do you know

640
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:44,920
we're going to kill demons?

641
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,410
You look smart.

642
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:49,350
Why do you always ask silly questions?

643
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:50,680
If you were me

644
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:52,940
and a dozen of people asked you every day,

645
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,750
you'd know everything too.

646
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:56,800
You people

647
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:58,830
just won't live a peaceful life.

648
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,160
If you have time,

649
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,590
why can't you spend it

650
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:02,880
doing something useful?

651
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:04,720
Today, you slaughter demons.

652
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:06,070
Tomorrow, you kill gods.

653
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:07,240
Do you know that civilians

654
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,510
can barely afford

655
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:09,880
to eat fish anymore?

656
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:15,110
Let's go.

657
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:16,830
He doesn't know anything.

658
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,720
Let's try our luck and take the waterway.

659
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:21,900
Take the land route.

660
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:26,710
I know where to find them.

661
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:30,660
[Serenity]

662
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,110
I noticed you didn't

663
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,070
eat much at dinner.

664
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,240
I made some porridge.

665
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,000
Do you want to try it?

666
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,440
Are you mad at me?

667
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:06,400
No.

668
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,440
Tanyin,

669
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:14,110
has anyone told you before

670
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:15,880
that you are

671
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:18,400
really bad at lying?

672
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,450
How unlucky.

673
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:25,110
You met me.

674
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:27,160
I'm the best liar

675
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:29,630
in this world.

676
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:31,990
In the future,

677
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:35,070
you will be completely fooled by me.

678
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:39,060
Don't say that.

679
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,620
Fine.

680
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,640
I swear to the heavens that

681
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,350
I, Yuanzhong, will never

682
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:50,400
lie to you again.

683
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,270
If I break this oath,

684
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,100
let my divine soul perish

685
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:56,070
and never be reincarnated.

686
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,680
Don't say that!

687
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,360
Don't blame me.

688
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:21,230
Don't be mad at me

689
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,480
and don't ignore me.

690
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:25,550
I know

691
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:27,280
I shouldn't force you,

692
00:34:29,469 --> 00:34:30,840
but you have to understand me.

693
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,710
I really have no other solutions.

694
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,440
I've been scared lately.

695
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:41,860
Just like when I was young,

696
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,889
I'm having nightmares every night.

697
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,719
I'm afraid that when I open my eyes,

698
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:49,880
you'll be gone.

699
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,920
I can't ask you

700
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,190
and I don't dare to ask.

701
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:56,480
I haven't been this afraid

702
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,880
in a long time.

703
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,810
I know I'm losing control.

704
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,960
But I just...

705
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:04,190
I just want to grab onto something

I will come back to you.

00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,920
That day on the tower of Yandu City,

765
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:09,970
♫If staying together is difficult, it's not worth it♫

766
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,960
I wanted to destroy the world.

767
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:13,030
♫I'll return what's left of my life♫

768
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,630
You were the one who stopped me.

769
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,320
From then on,

770
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:15,510
I've made up my mind.

771
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:16,290
♫Falling into the mortal world♫

772
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:18,460
♫Wandering through the clouds and rivers♫

773
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,800
I must

774
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,030
be with you for this lifetime.

775
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:22,550
♫Being by your side is like finding the shore♫

776
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,030
I want you to be my wife.

777
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:24,980
♫The moon falls by the riverbank♫

778
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:25,320
No one

779
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:27,160
♫The light finally dims♫

780
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:26,510
and nothing

781
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:31,170
♫How can my heart be at ease?♫

782
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:28,840
can change this.

783
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:31,670
Even you

784
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,880
♫Tears grow cold in a single cup♫

785
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,710
can't.

786
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,900
♫Longing fades in half♫

787
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:40,400
♫Like flowers in a mirror, or the moon in the water♫

788
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,110
So...

789
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:48,020
♫The lonely guest can't sleep, destiny can't be undone; speechless♫

790
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,400
Will you marry me?

791
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,880
I will love you well,

792
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:48,690
respect you,

793
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:51,090
♫Falling into the mortal world♫

794
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:50,350
and care for you.

795
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:53,180
♫Wandering through the clouds and rivers♫

796
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,550
You will be my priority

797
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:57,130
♫Being by your side is like finding the shore♫

798
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:54,960
and I'll always think for you.

799
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:57,110
You have to promise me.

800
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:59,630
♫The moon falls by the riverbank♫

801
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,730
Even if you guide me after death,

802
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:01,810
♫The light finally dims♫

803
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:02,710
you must do it completely.

804
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:05,810
♫How can my heart be at ease?♫

805
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:08,520
♫Tears grow cold in a single cup♫

806
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:10,550
♫Longing fades in half♫

807
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:15,040
♫Like flowers in a mirror, or the moon in the water♫

♫The lonely guest can't sleep, destiny can't be undone; speechless♫

809
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,550
Your handwriting is good.

810
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,760
Look at mine.

811
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:52,050
How is it?

812
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,320
Show her.

813
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,740
Ji Tanyin.

814
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,320
What do you think of my calligraphy?

815
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,130
♫Listening♫

816
00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:01,650
♫Toona leaves knock fireflies into a vase♫

817
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,280
What's wrong?

818
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:01,670
We don't need your help

819
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:03,030
for this type of matter.

820
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,640
♫Ripples faintly spreading♫

821
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:04,280
We can do it ourselves.

822
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:07,070
I'm happy. I want to help.

823
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,910
♫In the pavilion in the clouds♫

824
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:08,890
♫Warm wine brews to the sound of the zither♫

825
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,150
After you get married,

826
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:13,550
♫The fragrance lingers like brush strokes, sketching out your form♫

827
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:10,550
will you finally leave?

828
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,150
Dream on.

829
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,440
♫Tonight♫

830
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,360
What does that mean?

831
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:19,460
♫In a light intoxication, I feel the longing in the crystalline snow♫

832
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,360
Tell me, what does that mean?

833
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,670
It means "no way."

834
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:22,330
♫I cannot bear to think of you♫

835
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:22,710
Tanyin, look.

836
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,360
♫I only wish♫

837
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:24,320
No,

838
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,670
I'm busy making wedding pastries.

839
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:26,210
♫That the years would remain ever sunny♫

840
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:26,440
Look!

841
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,630
See if my papercutting is pretty.

842
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:30,790
♫So that, within the drifting light, I could share the breeze with you♫

843
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:29,320
Not pretty.

844
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:30,920
No?

845
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,370
♫The wind blows♫

846
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:33,000
I think it's pretty.

847
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,790
♫It stirs the scenery♫

848
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,760
Why don't you teach me?

849
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,540
♫It awakens our heart♫

850
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,630
Let's cut it together.

851
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:39,210
♫It makes me certain that you are my destiny♫

852
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:36,880
I told you

853
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,800
I'll make wedding pastries and you do papercutting.

854
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,030
Don't bother me.

855
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,080
♫The closer we get♫

856
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:40,920
You...

857
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:41,960
You won't accompany me?

858
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:42,710
♫The more it feels like a dream♫

859
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:42,800
I won't.

860
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:44,110
♫And the more I look intoxicated♫

861
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:48,450
♫I cannot fully express my yearning for you♫

862
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:45,030
Then

863
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:46,960
I'll stay here

864
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,280
to make wedding pastries with you.

865
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:49,580
♫The wind blows♫

866
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,360
♫It blows away the shadows of the clouds♫

867
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,190
No.

868
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:53,060
♫It makes the moon seem even brighter♫

869

Yuanzhong.

893
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,200
What's wrong?

894
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:27,000
Nothing.

895
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,960
There must be something.

896
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:31,590
What happened?

897
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,190
I saw you in my dream.

898
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:51,590
You were wearing this

899
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,190
and looked so scary.

900
00:41:58,680 --> 00:41:59,470
In the dream…

901
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:04,760
Dreams show opposite things.

902
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,280
The scarier I was in the dream,

903
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:12,150
the happier I'll be in reality.

904
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:17,510
Did I kiss you

905
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,360
in the dream?

906
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:40,790
So,

907
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,320
that wasn't the real me.

908
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:48,800
Are you still afraid?

909
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:30,480
Barrier?

910
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:42,970
Someone is coming.
