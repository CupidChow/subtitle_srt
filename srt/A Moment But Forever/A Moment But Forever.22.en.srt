00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,200
[Episode 22]

3
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,479
You've come at just the right time.

4
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:50,789
The Immortal Dance

5
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:52,070
is about to begin.

6
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,310
There are still some good seats available.

7
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,759
Let me take you to have a look.

8
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,310
Thank you.

9
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,280
You two aren't from Yandu, are you?

10
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:04,920
Don't blink later.

11
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,040
This Immortal Dance

12
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,710
is unique to Yandu.

13
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,120
Countless scholars and refined guests

14
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,750
come here just to witness its beauty.

15
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,080
How is it unique?

16
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,520
Miss,

17
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,710
why do I feel like you look familiar?

18
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,240
You must have mistaken me for someone else.

19
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,430
You just said this dance is unique.

20
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:24,760
What exactly makes it unique?

21
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,680
This dance isn't performed by humans.

22
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,030
Not performed by humans?

23
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,190
Then by what?

24
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,190
The Immortal Dance is,

25
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:33,250
of course, danced by immortals.

26
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:37,870
Please enjoy.

27
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:41,750
You think Xiu would like this place?

28
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,150
Let me look around.

29
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,280
Xiu.

30
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,400
Xiu?

31
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,470
Xiu.

32
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,000
Xiu.

33
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,000
Bravo! Bravo!

34
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,510
Bravo!

35
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,270
Goddess?

36
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,510
She's the Goddess.

37
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,590
Everyone, look, the Goddess.

38
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,220
It really is the Goddess.

39
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:42,680
Look at her.

40
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:45,659
Goddess.

41
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:46,950
Goddess?

42
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,680
Don't go, Goddess.

43
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,680
How could you let her leave?

44
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,750
Slow down!

45
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,190
That dancer

46
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,430
in the painting did look like me.

47
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:55,920
Maybe someone saw me before

48
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,159
and painted me.

49
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,270
But I really don't know

50
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,270
what's going on.

51
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,560
Yuanzhong!

52
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,070
What are you looking at?

53
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,909
♫Listening♫

54
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:44,430
♫Toona leaves knock fireflies into a vase♫

55
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,420
♫Ripples faintly spreading♫

56
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,680
♫In the pavilion in the clouds♫

57
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,670
♫Warm wine brews to the sound of the zither♫

58
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:56,330
♫The fragrance lingers like brush strokes, sketching out your form♫

59
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,040
When I was young, I saw someone

60
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,830
who looked very much like you.

61
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,220
♫Tonight♫

62
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:02,240
♫In a light intoxication, I feel the longing in the crystalline snow♫

63
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,680
Was it at the Pinghu battlefield?

64
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:05,110
♫I cannot bear to think of you♫

65
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,310
As you know, I...

66
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:04,950
No.

67
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,140
♫I only wish♫

68
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,240
It was even earlier than that.

69
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,990
♫That the years would remain ever sunny♫

70
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,570
♫So that, within the drifting light, I could share the breeze with you♫

71
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,950
It's just that it has been so long

72
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,800
that I've forgotten

73
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,150
♫The wind blows♫

74
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,830
what she looked like.

75
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:16,570
♫It stirs the scenery♫

76
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,320
♫It awakens our heart♫

77
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,360
Who was it?

78
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:21,990
♫It makes me certain that you are my destiny♫

79
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:22,430
Who was it?

80
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,860
♫The closer we get♫

81
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:25,490
♫The more it feels like a dream♫

82
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,880
♫And the more I look intoxicated♫

83
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:31,230
♫I cannot fully express my yearning for you♫

84
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,600
I actually don't know either.

85
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,360
♫The wind blows♫

86
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,140
♫It blows away the shadows of the clouds♫

87
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,840
♫It makes the moon seem even brighter♫

88
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:40,040
♫It makes me wake up from a dream♫

89
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,290
♫The wind blows♫

90
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,909
♫It reddens my eyes♫

91
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,940
♫It warms the promise we made♫

92
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:48,570
♫In the wind, we gently♫

93
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,280
♫Drift into a better place♫

94
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:54,450
♫The wind blows♫

95
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:55,909
♫It blows away the shadows of the clouds♫

96
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,580
♫It makes the moon seem even brighter♫

97
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,930
♫It makes me wake up from a dream♫

98
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,340
♫The wind blows♫

99
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,670
♫It reddens my eyes♫

100
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:06,690
♫It warms the promise we made♫

101
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:10,490
♫In the wind, we gently♫

102
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:13,790
♫Drift into a better place♫

103
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,720
It's so quiet here.

104
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,190
Would Xiu be here?

105
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,120
He should be here.

106
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,460
The Divine Hand has already sensed it.

107
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,350
I'll try to wake him up.

108
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:34,679
Is there anything I can do?

109
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:35,480
No.

110
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,670
Xiu.

111
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,510
Xiu?

112
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:54,720
Xiu.

113
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,750
Xiu!

114
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:05,040
Dad,

115
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:07,150
why are we worshiping a firecracker?

116
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,860
Don't talk nonsense. This is the Fire God.

117
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,510
Disrespecting the gods

118
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,550
will get you slapped.

119
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,240
But this is clearly

120
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,840
just a big firecracker.

121
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,030
You don't understand.

122
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,870
This is our family's guardian deity.

123
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,390
It's the Fire God's manifested form.

124
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:21,600
This was passed down from your

125
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,550
grandfather's grandfather.

126
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:23,870
As long as it's here,

127
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,150
our family's fireworks shop

128
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,270
will be safe and sound,

129
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,270
with no disasters or misfortune.

130
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,240
Really?

131
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,750
Stop talking so much.

132
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:30,630
Just worship it.

133
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,840
If it weren't for the god's protection,

134
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,440
who could have made such a big firecracker?

135
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:52,720
Xiu,

136
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,240
go back to your position.

137
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,240
Xiu,

138
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,630
go back to your position.

139
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,360
Who is it? Who is speaking?

140
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,440
Dad, Dad,

141
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,480
the Fire God seems to be about to explode!

142
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:04,480
What?

143
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,840
Dad, what should we do?

144
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,750
The Fire God is going to explode! It's going to explode!

145
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:51,910
You're right.

146
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,510
Xiu indeed likes lively scenes.

147
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,840
-Xiu, stop crying.
-Xiu.

148
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,670
Shut your mouth

149
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:21,480
right now.

150
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,320
Why does he keep crying?

151
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,320
Are you hungry?

152
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,320
Come on, think of a solution.

153
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,700
What can I do?

154
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,360
Isn't he your weapon spirit?

155
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,720
Don't you know the reason?

156
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,510
Well...

157
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,440
He wasn't like this the last time I saw him.

158
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,150
What was he like then?

159
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,150
He… he wasn't a baby.

160
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,320
At most, he was a child

161
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,600
and he was growing rapidly.

162
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,030
Do you remember

163
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,030
what he ate

164
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:48,910
to grow up?

165
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:52,870
At that time on Fangwai Mountain,

166
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,270
Zi Fei and Kai Shan were taking care of him,

167
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,390
so I didn't pay much attention.

168
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,200
Just think of a solution now.

169
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,000
He can't keep crying like this.

170
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,820
How about feeding him some wine

171
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:07,840
and getting him drunk?

172
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,480
He...

173
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,200
He's still a child.

174
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,410
He's a weapon spirit, not a child.

175
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:13,910
Xiu,

176
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,390
I know you can understand what I'm saying.

177
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:16,720
Shut up

178
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,360
right now,

179
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,030
or I'll stuff you back

180
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,240
into the firecracker.

181
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,790
There, there, there.

182
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,550
There, there.

183
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:24,910
Xiu, stop crying.

184
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:26,790
Stop crying. Stop crying.

185
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:27,960
Xiu, stop crying.

186
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:30,150
Stop crying. Stop crying.

187
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,720
Stop crying. Stop crying, Xiu.

188
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:32,960
There, there.

189
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,790
Stop crying, okay?

190
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,550
Stop crying. Stop crying.

191
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,510
There, there.

192
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,440
Stop crying, okay?

193
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,200
There, there.

194
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,120
Yuanzhong.

195
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:40,840
Yuanzhong!

196
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,480
You try it.

197
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,240
There, there.

198
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,510
Stop crying,

199
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,480
Xiu.

200
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:53,150
Stop crying. Stop crying.

201
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,350
It's 1 AM, and the world is peaceful and safe!

202
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:05,250
It's 1 AM, and the world is peaceful and safe!

203
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,270
Yuanzhong.

204
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,360
Yuanzhong, wake up!

205
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,360
Look at Xiu!

206
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,510
I can't handle him.

207
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:18,870
He's grown up.

208
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,730
Where is he?

209
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,390
X-Xiu.

210
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:30,380
Look.

211
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:37,900
The hairpin?

212
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,840
I remember now.

213
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,200
What do you remember?

214
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,630
Xiu doesn't eat ordinary food.

215
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,100
He needs to eat gold to grow up.

216
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:51,120
Eat gold?

217
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:51,860
Yes.

218
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,360
Xiu is of the fire element.

219
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,480
He feeds on gold.

220
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:55,480
Back then, on Fangwai Mountain,

221
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,790
Zi Fei and the others must have fed him

222
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:57,720
a lot of gold

223
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,110
to make him grow up in one day.

224
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,320
Feeding on gold?

225
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:02,330
But...

226
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:04,790
But we don't have any gold.

227
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:09,480
Xiu, Xiu.

228
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,440
I know you can understand me.

229
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:13,690
Let me tell you,

230
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,150
things are different now.

231
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:16,910
If you want to stay by my side,

232
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:18,330
you'll have to earn your own food.

233
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,150
Don't count on me.

234
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,030
Did you hear that?

235
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,790
-Yuanzhong.
-How dare you.

236
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:32,550
Yuanzhong!

237
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:34,750
He's still a kid.

238
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,840
He can't earn his own food yet.

239
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,600
Don't be so harsh on him.

240
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,440
He's young?

241
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,510
The number of people he killed on the Pinghu battlefield

242
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:42,320
was no less than mine.

243
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,080
That was on a battlefield. It was different.

244
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,910
He's just a child now.

245
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,630
Right, Xiu?

246
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,000
See?

247
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,440
If you rely on your master,

248
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:53,300
you'll probably starve

249
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:54,420
before you even grew up.

250
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,670
Alright, never mind.

251
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:58,320
I'll figure out a way

252
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,440
to earn food for him.

253
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,490
[Qiju Pavilion]

254
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:19,720
Mr. Xu,

255
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,080
if there's anything else that needs repairing,

256
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,360
bring it out for me.

257
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,670
There's nothing

258
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:24,750
I can't fix.

259
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:25,550
Alright, alright.

260
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,080
Yi, go and get everything

261
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,600
that needs repairing here.

262
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:29,840
Yes.

263
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,200
Don't touch it.

264
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:52,630
Mr. Xu, they're all fixed now.

265
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,840
Yi, go get the silver.

266
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,510
Wait a moment.

267
00:15:58,670 --> 00:15:59,480
Miss Ji,

268
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,550
business requires honesty.

269
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:03,720
We agreed that

270
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,080
if you fix these things,

271
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,510
I'd give you 10 taels of silver.

272
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,550
You can't go back on your word.

273
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,630
What I mean is,

274
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,770
could you

275
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:12,960
exchange this silver

276
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,080
for gold beans?

277
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:20,440
Thank you.

278
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:22,080
Here.

279
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:23,840
Eat slowly.

280
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:29,550
They are all gone already?

281
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,480
Looks like raising a child

282
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,750
really is expensive.

283
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,080
How about

284
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,390
we go find Zi Fei?

285
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:40,440
The journey is long,

286
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,510
and the travel expenses

287
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,750
would cost money too.

288
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,320
But with how much Xiu eats,

289
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,630
even if we work ourselves to the bone,

290
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,200
we still won't earn enough gold.

291
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:51,790
Hey,

292
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,720
why didn't you bring any money

293
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,750
when you came out?

294
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,360
You didn't bring any either.

295
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,600
But I'm your handmaiden.

296
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,270
Bravo!

297
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,240
If we really can't figure out a way,

298
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,510
let's just let Xiu go hungry.

299
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,060
He's a weapon spirit. He won't starve to death.

300
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,270
How can we do that?

301
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,880
That way, he won't be able to grow up.

302
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,270
Then what do you suggest?

303
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,790
How about...

304
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:42,310
How about you

305
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:43,350
seal him away for now

306
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:45,160
and unseal him when Zi Fei and the others arrive?

307
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,110
Impressive.

308
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,640
You actually came up with that idea.

309
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,240
I'm starting to doubt

310
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,640
your identity as the Mute Lady of Wu Mountain.

311
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,200
Then what do you suggest we do?

312
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,240
Xiu?

313
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,720
Xiu!

314
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,790
Xiu is gone.

315
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,480
Where did this child come from?

316
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:17,680
What's going on?

317
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,830
Where did this child come from?

318
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:23,000
Where did this child come from?

319
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,400
My bracelet was stolen!

320
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:25,590
Let me take a look.

321
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,680
Excuse me,

322
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:35,920
have you seen a boy,

323
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,680
about 4 or 5 years old,

324
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,880
wearing red clothes?

325
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,920
Waiter, bring us the wine!

326
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:41,260
Coming!

327
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,590
Sorry, there are a lot of people here.

328
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:43,750
I honestly didn't notice.

329
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,310
Please look for him yourself.

330
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,750
Do you think he might be here?

331
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:50,650
Let's split up and look for him.

332
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,750
What are you dawdling for?

333
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:58,720
You're about to go on stage.

334
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,920
Be quick.

335
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,880
I'll be ready soon.

336
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:01,960
I just need to wear a hairpin.

337
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,640
Hurry up.

338
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,510
Where did it go?

339
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,590
It was here just now.

340
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,030
Which hairpin?

341
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,240
The one from Mr. Dong,

342
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,200
the gold one.

343
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,160
It should be in the jewelry box.

344
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,030
My earrings and necklaces

345
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,000
are also missing.

346
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:23,830
What's going on?

347
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,510
Whose child is this?

348
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,980
Whose child is this?

349
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,030
All mine are gone.

350
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:47,060
Whose child is this?

351
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,520
Whose child is stealing?

352
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:49,110
Exactly.

353
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,320
Such a young kid,

354
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:51,440
and his parents don't even supervise him.

355
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,670
Xiu, come out.

356
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,200
You...

357
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,550
-He ran away!
-Xiu!

358
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:01,550
He stole things!

359
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,590
Xiu.

360
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:14,920
Xiu.

361
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,550
Where did this child come from?

362
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,400
Xiu.

363
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:23,250
Xiu?

364
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,790
-Stop running.
-Xiu!

365
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,640
Let's see if you dare run again.

366
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,920
I told you not to run around.

367
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,240
Xiu, give it to me now.

368
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:41,790
Stop them!

369
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:42,780
Stop him!

370
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:43,750
It's him!

371
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,350
Pay up! Pay up!

372
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,310
You thief!

373
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:47,160
Pay up!

374
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,400
Xiu is asleep?

375
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:02,920
He's sleeping like a pig.

376
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:09,160
We were lucky today that Mr. Xu

377
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,310
was willing to lend us money.

378
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,200
Otherwise,

379
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,880
it wouldn't have been so easy to get away.

380
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,680
He's sleeping so soundly.

381
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,510
He's full,

382
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,830
so of course he's sleeping soundly.

383
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,070
When you said you thought he was a hassle earlier,

384
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,680
I thought you were joking.

385
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,510
Now,

386
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,200
I've really experienced it.

387
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,920
Raising a child really isn't easy.

388
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,680
He's not a child.

389
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,350
But he looks like one.

390
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,110
Look at him now.

391
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,000
He looks about 3 or 4 years old.

392
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:47,310
But...

393
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:49,230
why can't he speak yet?

394
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,110
What did he look like when he grew up?

395
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,680
Just like that.

396
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:57,160
Was he well-behaved?

397
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,550
He was fine.

398
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,350
I've never seen

399
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:03,960
a weapon spirit

400
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,400
that can grow up like him.

401
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:09,030
Have you seen many weapon spirits?

402
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,680
A few, I suppose.

403
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,160
It is said that the Mute Lady of Wu Mountain is skilled in crafting.

404
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,400
Have you ever created

405
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:16,030
a divine artifact that can produce weapon spirits?

406
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:16,790
Of course.

407
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:17,920
What kind?

408
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,400
A lot.

409
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,720
Nonsense.

410
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,000
If you were really that capable,

411
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,720
you'd be the God of Craft.

412
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:30,880
Do you

413
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,240
have anything else to do now?

414
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,240
Why?

415
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,200
Come with me.

416
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,030
What?

417
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,830
You haven't

418
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,110
eaten anything all day.

419
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:46,440
Are you hungry?

420
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:50,160
When did you buy these?

421
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,160
Just now.

422
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,350
The owner of the noodle shop, Mr. Zhao,

423
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:54,160
said this shop makes very good dim sum,

424
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,270
so I bought some for you

425
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:56,350
to try.

426
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,310
Is it good?

427
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:12,920
Yuanzhong,

428
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,400
don't worry.

429
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,110
Mr. Xu from Qiju Pavilion

430
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:17,790
wants to hire me

431
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:19,110
as a craftsman there.

432
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,140
With my skills,

433
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,790
I'll be able to pay back the money soon.

434
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:22,720
And Xiu

435
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,920
will grow up quickly.

436
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,200
Do you really want Xiu to grow up?

437
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:27,920
Of course.

438
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,270
Don't you?

439
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:35,880
Yuanzhong,

440
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,680
after all the weapon spirits

441
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,830
are unsealed,

442
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:40,310
what do you plan to do?

443
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,790
If you haven't thought about it,

444
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:44,200
I've already come up with something for you.

445
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,310
What do you have in mind?

446
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:49,400
These are some excerpts from travel notes

447
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,720
I transcribed from memory.

448
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,480
Look.

449
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,310
"I was to the east of Tanlu Pavilion,

450
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:55,310
gazing at Chizhou,

451
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,550
delighted by the sight.

452
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:57,750
Crossing the Imperial River,

453
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:59,000
treading the Wan Stream,

454
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,350
traversing remote lands,

455
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,880
and drinking a lot of sweet spring water,

456
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:03,400
I reached the summit of the high mountain

457
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,550
and the source of the river.

458
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,960
Only then did I rest."

459
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:07,510
What does this describe?

460
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,680
This is about a poet

461
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,720
who accidentally discovered the magnificent scenery of Chizhou.

462
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:13,110
He crossed the Xiao River,

463
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:14,350
climbed to the summit of Western Mountain,

464
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,960
beheld the breathtaking landscape,

465
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,400
experienced the charm of nature,

466
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,750
and suddenly felt his heart open

467
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,440
and his spirit become one with the world.

468
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,590
What about this one?

469
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,750
This is about a local custom.

470
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,480
They have a tradition of drinking on ice beds.

471
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:30,830
People feast joyfully,

472
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,430
offering rare delicacies

473
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,550
and countless fine wines,

474
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:34,790
drinking heartily on ice beds,

475
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:35,960
and singing loudly while admiring the snow.

476
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:40,030
"Idly sitting among the pines,

477
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,270
watching the snow collected from the pine branches melt in the pot."

478
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,200
Exactly.

479
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:47,550
This is a celestial phenomenon

480
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:48,960
recorded in A Trip to Yongguan.

481
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,030
It tells

482
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:51,200
of a strange sight

483
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,370
in the sky there—

484
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,160
on a long night,

485
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,680
a five-colored light appeared,

486
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,640
shaped like a dragon or snake, illuminating the land,

487
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,680
and it didn't disappear until half a month later.

488
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,510
The sky there is colorful.

489
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:01,220
A colorful sky?

490
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,040
Yes.

491
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:02,900
There are countless

492
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:03,960
famous scenic spots and beautiful landscapes

493
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,860
in this world.

494
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,830
Each place has its own scenery and customs.

495
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,240
Yuanzhong,

496
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,480
after Xiu grows up

497
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,680
and Ling Yao's seal is lifted,

498
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,030
you should travel around

499
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:13,310
and explore the world.

500
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,750
You can see how flowers bloom,

501
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:17,270
how the rain falls,

502
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,510
see the ice beds of the far north,

503
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:20,830
and the underground fire in the southern border.

504
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:21,960
Just go wherever you want

505
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:23,830
and live wherever you like.

506
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,750
How does that sound?

507
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:29,960
If I go traveling,

508
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:32,690
what about you?

509
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,960
Of course I'll go with you.

510
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,200
If Zi Fei and the others are willing,

511
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,920
they can come along too.

512
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,480
Yuanzhong,

513
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,030
this world is vast,

514
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,680
far beyond the grudges between the Youhu Clan

515
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,640
and the War Demons.

516
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,880
Go and see it for yourself

517
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,070
and live some lighthearted days.

518
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,120
You can see how flowers bloom,

519
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:18,720
how the rain falls,

520
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,920
see the ice beds of the far north,

521
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:22,240
and the underground fire in the southern border.

522
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,550
Just go wherever you want

523
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:25,200
and live wherever you like.

524
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,750
Yuanzhong,

525
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,350
this world is vast,

526
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,000
far beyond the grudges between the Youhu Clan

527
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,920
and the War Demons.

528
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:35,160
Go and see it for yourself

529
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,270
and live some lighthearted days.

530
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:04,830
How could this happen?

531
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:33,160
Deity Taihe's body

532
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:35,270
may not last much longer.

533
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,550
Once his divine body collapses

534
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:37,750
and he has no other body to attach to,

535
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,720
I'm afraid

536
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:41,100
he'll soon vanish from this world.

537
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,400
What rotten luck.

538
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:02,160
We took on such a wretched task.

539
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,530
Stop complaining.

540
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,920
The construction in the city can't be completed.

541
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,070
If we don't get them to do it, who will?

542
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:07,110
Are you going to do it, or should I?

543
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,830
Look at them.

544
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,750
They're all beggars and vagrants.

545
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,790
They're so hungry that they're almost fainting.

546
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,090
How could they have the strength to work?

547
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:17,400
We just need to gather enough people

548
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,240
and hand over the required headcount.

549
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:20,350
How many more do we need?

550
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,720
One.

551
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:27,640
Well, here's one right here.

552
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,050
Stop.

553
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,070
Where's your pass?

554
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:33,680
You brat, playing dumb with me, huh?

555
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,510
Waiter!

556
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,640
Coming!

557
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,270
Come.

558
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:42,310
What should we do now?

559
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,790
What should we do this time?

560
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,590
Once we enter the city, we'll be doing hard labor.

561
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,440
Bro,

562
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,270
do you want to come up with a plan

563
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:52,400
to leave here with us?

564
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,400
Yes, bro.

565
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,400
Once we enter the city, there will be nothing good waiting for us.

566
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,030
Exactly.

567
00:28:58,830 --> 00:28:59,790
Let's hit the road.

568
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:00,830
Let's go.

569
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,680
Let's go.

570
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:02,640
They ran away!

571
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:03,790
Stop!

572
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,310
Keep an eye on them!

573
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:07,200
Get up! I said get up!

574
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,030
Get up!

575
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,760
[City Lord's Mansion]

576
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,720
Young Mistress Dai.

577
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,440
You're here.

578
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,880
How are you feeling? Are you better now?

579
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:26,920
Much better.

580
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,680
The medicine from Dr. Zhang

581
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,030
is really effective.

582
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,310
Then I must thank him properly.

583
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,510
Young Mistress.

584
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,240
The medicine is ready.

585
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:39,000
I still have things to do in the kitchen,

586
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,430
so please feed him the medicine for me.

587
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,480
-Okay.
-No need.

588
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,640
Well... thank you.

589
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:24,440
Have one of these.

590
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:26,070
No need.

591
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:28,540
Have one. The medicine is very bitter.

592
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,070
You've never tried it.

593
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,640
How do you know it's bitter?

594
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:33,640
I...

595
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:36,830
I just know.

596
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,370
It's too sweet.

597
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,230
Is it really that sweet?

598
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:50,270
Eating sweet things like this every day,

599
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,350
be careful your teeth might fall out when you get old.

600
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:54,440
My teeth are fine.

601
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,780
They won't fall out when I'm old.

602
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,000
Really?

603
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,640
I've been old before, remember?

604
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,070
Always seeing you like this,

605
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,010
I really have forgotten.

606
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,400
What does it feel like

607
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,250
to age?

608
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:19,830
Actually, it's not that bad.

609
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,150
It's just that...

610
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:23,070
my energy was waning day by day;

611
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,400
I couldn't run or jump high,

612
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,640
and walking became slower and slower.

613
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,400
At first, it was hard to accept,

614
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:31,920
but gradually, I got used to it.

615
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,680
Sometimes, I wonder,

616
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,400
if in this world,

617
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,000
there were no Youhu Clan,

618
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:39,830
no immortal sects,

619
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:41,310
no cultivators,

620
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,920
and no gods,

621
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:44,440
perhaps we humans

622
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,480
would more easily

623
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,960
accept aging.

624
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:48,440
Perhaps.

625
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,480
Comparisons breed discontent.

626
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,720
All the suffering in this world

627
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:55,310
comes from discontent.

628
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,920
Even someone like my father

629
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,070
can't see through the cycle of life and death.

630
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:03,110
How much longer will it take for your father to exit seclusion?

631
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,790
It should be some time.

632
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:08,590
Don't worry.

633
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,160
Shen Ying and your subordinates

634
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,030
are still investigating Wushuang Society.

635
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:13,720
I've already

636
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,000
informed my brother about this.

637
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,640
Yandu will never allow anyone

638
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,160
to secretly communicate with the War Demons.

639
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,110
We will definitely

640
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:20,640
investigate this thoroughly

641
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:21,900
and give you an explanation.

642
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:23,920
Thank you.

643
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,270
There's no need to thank me.

644
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:29,640
The War Demons are also our enemies.

645
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,270
Whoever came up with this plan

646
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:32,790
of inciting stronger enemies to eliminate weaker ones

647
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,750
is truly shortsighted.

648
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:37,480
Inciting stronger enemies to eliminate weaker ones?

649
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,720
You're really direct, aren't you?

650
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,400
What do I have to hide from you?

651
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:44,960
Although we humans have always been oppressed

652
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,160
by the Youhu Clan,

653
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,720
if the War Demons rise,

654
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:51,680
they'll be after our lives.

655
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:53,340
The weak always get beaten.

656
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:55,110
What's the use of complaining?

657
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,920
It's better to work hard to develop ourselves,

658
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,240
and sooner or later, there will be a day

659
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,880
when we can have an equal conversation.

660
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,000
Let's not talk about this anymore.

661
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,310
Is this for me?

662
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,400
I was afraid you might get bored.

663
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:13,790
What are these?

664
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:17,570
How is it going?

665
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,160
Shh, they're talking.

666
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:23,160
This is a puzzle.

667
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,000
When you're tired from reading,

668
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,030
you can work on these.

669
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,080
It's very simple.

670
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:31,380
Are you sure this is simple?

671
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:33,840
I used to do puzzles all the time when I was a kid.

672
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:34,900
I can teach you.

673
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:51,000
It's here.

674
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:53,920
I was about to find it.

675
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,230
♫Listening♫

676
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:01,640

♫In the pavilion in the clouds♫

♫Warm wine brews to the sound of the zither♫

681
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:07,790
You've done it before,

682
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:09,630
so it's easier for you to do it again.

683
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:13,010
♫The fragrance lingers like brush strokes, sketching out your form♫

684
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,400
This is a new one I had someone buy.

685
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:14,510
My old puzzles from when I was a kid

686
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,040
♫Tonight♫

687
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,510
are many years old,

688
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:19,060
♫In a light intoxication, I feel the longing in the crystalline snow♫

689
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:16,670
and they're long gone.

00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:22,130
♫I cannot bear to think of you♫

♫I only wish♫

♫That the years would remain ever sunny♫

693
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:26,760
You can't find it again?

694
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:30,960
♫So that, within the drifting light, I could share the breeze with you♫

695
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:29,400
It's here.

696
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:31,920
I can find it.

697
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,150
♫The wind blows♫

00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,020

Young City Lord.

737
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:09,450
They caused such a big mess?

738
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,510
The scouts from Orange Lake reported that

739
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:13,360
the High Priest of the Youhu Clan and his group

740
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,510
have headed toward Su River.

741
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:16,320
Our people have already been following them.

742
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:18,070
Just follow them from a distance.

743
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,880
They are not ordinary people.

744
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,340
Don't draw their attention.

745
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:23,440
Rest assured, Young City Lord.

746
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,230
What is this High Priest

747
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:28,930
really thinking?

748
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,050
Since he has already broken the seal,

749
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,230
why doesn't he

750
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:33,670
take action against the Council of Elders?

751
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,970
He once held a high position,

752
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,350
with the strength of a demigod.

753
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:39,270
After being imprisoned

754
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:40,480
and enduring much torture,

755
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,680
he has finally escaped.

756
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,480
Yet, he's not seeking revenge on them.

757
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,070
Could it be

758
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:48,030
that he has really transcended human emotions,

759
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:49,000
no longer harboring any feelings

760
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,360
of love, hate, or resentment?

761
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:53,070
Or perhaps...

762
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,030
he doesn't hold a grudge against his own people

763
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,470
and only wishes to deal with the War Demons?

764
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,800
If that's the case, it could be troublesome.

765
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,630
What about Shen Ying?

766
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,320
Is he still with the Youhu people

767
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,230
recently?

768
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,280
Yes.

769
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:12,030
They've been very close lately

770
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,400
and are investigating Wushuang Society.

771
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:16,390
Some clues are already very close.

772
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,800
Our people are working to intervene.

773
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,590
How is Mr. Tanghua's injury?

774
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,760
It's getting better.

775
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,070
What about him and Zhi Dai?

776
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:25,190
I've had people keep an eye on them.

777
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:26,360
The two of them

778
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:27,760
are getting along very well.

779
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:33,540
Getting along very well?

780
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,670
Miss Ji.

781
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:40,190
You overpaid me, Mr. Xu.

782
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:41,210
My things

783
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,680
aren't worth so much silver.

784
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,070
And I still owe you money.

785
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,280
I didn't overpay you.

786
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,630
This is all you deserve.

787
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:50,360
Well then, thank you very much.

788
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,400
Is this a new treasure you got?

789
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:56,000
I've never seen it before.

790
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:57,710
You really have a great eye.

791
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,990
This item is extraordinary.

792
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:04,150
Watch closely, Miss.

793
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:05,550
Its magic

794
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:06,880
is yet to come.

795
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:22,090
It's truly exquisite.

796
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,260
It doesn't seem like magic.

797
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,400
It's just ordinary clay,

798
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,440
fired

799
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,920
and coated with a layer of gold powder.

800
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,280
There's nothing particularly special about it.

801
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:35,420
This is the work of the great painter,

802
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,800
Mr. Qi.

803
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,030
Mr. Qi?

804
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,190
Well,

805
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,360
was the statue of the Goddess in the main hall of the dance house

806
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:46,670
also painted by him?

807
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,840
I really don't know.

808
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,440
Take care, Miss Ji.

809
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,400
Please come again another day.

810
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,880
Truly a masterpiece.

811
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:08,000
How was it made?

812
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:13,400
Young City Lord, you're here.

813
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,590
You seem so happy.

814
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:16,440
What treasure did you get this time?

815
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,290
I did indeed get a treasure,

816
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,630
and I was about to present it to you, Young City Lord.

817
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:26,170
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you, sir.

818
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,200
Take care.

819
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,510
Who gave me this silver?

820
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:51,060
How much is this?

821
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,630
This...

822
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:54,760
Xue?

823
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,510
Long time no see.

824
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,640
Tell me, what strange thing

825
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:01,150
did you do to me while on the boat?

826
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:03,250
W-what strange thing?

827
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,200
I didn't do anything.

828
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:05,010
Nonsense.

829
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,710
I asked around after I came back.

830
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,360
You said you were my neighbor,

831
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,480
but why didn't any of the people I know

832
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,500
recognize you?

833
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:12,090
You must have used some kind of sorcery on me.

834
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,180
Well...

835
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:16,030
Really?

836
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:17,650
Really.

837
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,590
I had no other choice at the time.

838
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:20,320
I had to find him

839
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,230
right away.

840
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:23,000
Otherwise, we all would have been in trouble.

841
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,550
I know.

842
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:26,070
After you all left,

843
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:27,840
everyone said that the High Priest of the Youhu Clan

844
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,840
saved us.

845
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,110
And without you,

846
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:31,610
I'm afraid I wouldn't have survived.

847
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:33,880
But no matter if you're my childhood friend or not,

848
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,710
you left without saying a word,

849
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:36,800
and that really made me angry.

850
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,840
I had to go after him at that time.

851
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:43,030
Alright.

852
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:45,010
I'll forgive you then.

853
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,590
Well, you're not my neighbor anymore,

854
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:50,280
but an immortal's handmaiden

855
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:51,880
who can use magic.

856
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:52,880
You're a big shot now.

857
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,460
Do you still want to be my friend?

858
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,960
Of course!

859
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:57,360
I'm so happy

860
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,400
to meet you again

861
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:59,740
here in Yandu.

862
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:02,760
Waiter! Waiter!

863
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:03,920
Pack some date cakes for me.

864
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,710
I'm taking them with me.

865
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:05,440
Alright!

866
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:06,320
Let me tell you,

867
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,630
the date cakes here are delicious.

868
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:08,590
Take some back

869
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:09,880
for your High Priest to try.

870
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:10,630
I'm sure he'll like them.

871
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:11,440
Really?

872
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:12,510
Try some.

873
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:16,320
It tastes so good.

874
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:16,840
Right?

875
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,670
Make way! Make way!

876
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,630
Hurry up!

877
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:20,880
Hurry!

878
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:24,230
Move!

879
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:25,070
Make way! Make way!

880
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,070
Hurry up!

881
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,400
So you moved out?

882
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:35,280
After I left the Shen family's tower ship,

883
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:36,700
I got quite a bit of pay.

884
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:38,450
When I came back, I rented a big courtyard

885
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,590
and now I live alone.

886
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,670
Let me tell you,

887
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:41,760
my place is really big.

888
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:43,260
It's not crowded no matter how many people live here.

889
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,400
I'm thinking of

890
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:46,040
subletting two rooms

891
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:46,960
to make some extra money

892
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,070
and also make the place a bit livelier.

893
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:50,670
Make way! Make way!

894
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:52,320
Hurry up!

895
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,760
Hurry up, all of you!

896
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:55,360
Move!

897
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,150
Hurry up! Move it!

898
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,320
What do they do?

899
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:10,920
They're all laborers for the workshop.

900
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,030
Many of them are vagrants who were caught here.

901
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:16,110
Why is he here?

902
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,430
Do you know anyone among them?

903
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,880
You just said that

904
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:21,880
as long as there's enough money,

905
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,070
they can be ransomed?

906
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,190
Come with me.

907
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:45,670
Brat,

908
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:47,550
were you the one who snitched earlier?

909
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:49,990
Playing mute, huh?

910
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,550
-Teach him a lesson!
-Yes!

911
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:54,350
You try snitching again

912
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:55,440
and see what happens!

913
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:56,190
Stop.

914
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,030
They're all here.

915
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,280
Pick whoever you want.

916
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:07,960
I want him.
