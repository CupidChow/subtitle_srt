[A Moment But Forever]

00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,120
[Episode 30]

3
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:51,560
Kill him! Kill him!

4
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:52,590
Kill him!

5
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,150
How dare you?

6
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,560
Why wouldn't I dare?

7
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,360
This is meant to imprison a god.

8
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,710
I don't want to be a god anymore.

9
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,470
You can't trap me.

10
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,000
Do you know what a god is?

11
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,120
Hou Yi saved the world,

12
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,910
shooting down the suns with his bow.

13
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,520
Yu the Great controlled the floods,

14
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,590
bringing peace to his people.

15
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,910
Kuafu chased the sun

16
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,840
and died pursuing his ambition.

17
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,150
Shennong tasted countless herbs,

18
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,750
benefiting all living creatures.

19
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,120
They were all once human—

20
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,960
brave,

21
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:08,710
resolute,

22
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,280
selfless,

23
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,910
compassionate,

24
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,840
and fearless.

25
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,360
But you...

26
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:19,970
you want to imprison me?

27
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:30,750
You're not worthy to represent the human race!

28
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,400
I won't kill you. I want you to live.

29
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,470
I want you, a narrow-minded scumbag,

30
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:36,600
to see

31
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:38,450
how all things in the four seasons,

32
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,540
in their rise and fall,

33
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:43,240
will find their own path

34
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,630
without relying on a demon's guidance.

35
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,320
Zhi Yue,

36
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:52,930
demon slayer from Yandu.

37
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,000
Lord Wenying,

38
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,800
demon slayer from Fangwai Mountain.

39
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,750
Lv Chengshi from Fangwai Mountain.

40
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,920
Slay the demon!

41
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:02,190
Slay the demon! Slay the demon! Slay the demon!

42
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:05,000
Slay the demon! Slay the demon! Slay the demon!

43
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,750
Slay the demon! Slay the demon! Slay the demon!

44
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:10,800
Slay the demon! Slay the demon! Slay the demon!

45
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,830
Slay the demon! Slay the demon! Slay the demon!

46
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:16,600
Slay the demon! Slay the demon! Slay the demon!

47
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,430
Slay the demon! Slay the demon! Slay the demon!

48
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:24,630
Slay the demon! Slay the demon! Slay the demon!

49
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:47,409
Slay the demon! Slay the demon! Slay the demon!

50
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,090
What a grand show.

51
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,390
So many righteous demon slayers.

52
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:05,080
Since you all want to kill me,

53
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:08,470
then bring it on.

54
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,700
Fire!

55
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:55,010
Yuanzhong.

56
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:08,630
Yuanzhong.

57
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:10,430
Yuanzhong.

58
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,190
I'm here.

59
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,580
Ji Tanyin.

60
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,800
Look.

61
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,480
Even in such a filthy place,

62
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:34,430
two little flowers have managed to bloom.

63
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,960
Who is this person?

64
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,240
Who... who is she?

65
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,040
Who is she?

66
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:02,070
I'm Ji Tanyin from Liujiao Palace.

67
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,070
All soldiers, release the arrows!

68
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,790
Catch them.

69
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,560
Don't let them escape!

70
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,720
Yes!

71
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,380
We're not escaping.

72
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,630
This city was built by me.

73
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:36,549
The origin of everything; the root of all energy;

74
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:37,840
the source of wisdom; the return of all creation.

75
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,080
Yandu, retract!

76
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:48,330
Even if I've lost my divine bone,

77
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:50,860
it's still at my disposal.

78
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:02,440
Yuanzhong.

79
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,720
Let's go.

80
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,150
They're just ahead. After them!

81
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,840
-How is it?
-Young City Lord.

82
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,440
Tanghua of the Youhu Clan

83
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,360
and that War Demon

84
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,510
were caught in the chaos.

85
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,480
They're now in the dungeon,

86
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,480
awaiting punishment.

87
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:19,750
As for the High Priest,

88
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,030
Chief Li Chaoyang

89
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,240
personally led people to pursue him.

90
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:23,870
I've also secretly sent assassins

91
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:24,870
from the martial world after him.

92
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,320
It should be foolproof.

93
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,200
What about Zhi Dai?

94
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,120
She hasn't been found yet.

95
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,270
Find her quickly.

96
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,910
Make sure to kill her this time.

97
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,550
Yes.

98
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,250
Ji Tanyin…

99
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,480
Who on earth is she?

100
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,440
Greetings, my lords.

101
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,840
May I ask why you've

102
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,150
summoned us here?

103
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,600
Goddess Wushuang

104
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,670
has disappeared

105
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,960
from the Divine Registry.

106
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,320
How is that possible?

107
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:12,560
Just now,

108
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,750
the Temple of Wushuang

109
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,870
also crumbled into dust.

110
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:16,550
Well...

111
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,080
How could this happen?

112
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,480
Goddess Wushuang

113
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,220
might have perished in the mortal realm,

114
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,960
or perhaps someone took her divine bone

115
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,390
and destroyed her divinity,

116
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,240
causing the heavenly way to no longer see her as a god.

117
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,820
When was the last time she returned?

118
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,440
Was there anything unusual?

119
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,790
My lord,

120
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,080
Goddess Wushuang

121
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,910
returned a few days ago.

122
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,240
But she left in a hurry,

123
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,080
without saying much

124
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,480
about what happened in the mortal realm.

125
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,000
Many people worship you in the mortal realm.

126
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,910
Can you use them

127
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,720
to find out what happened

128
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,270
to Goddess Wushuang?

129
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:49,670
My lord,

130
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:51,320
your command is my duty.

131
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,360
Mr. Loong.

132
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:31,660
Why are you here?

133
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,210
I was thinking about Taihe

134
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,320
and happened to pass by,

135
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,870
so I came to check on him.

136
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,440
At the Discipline Hall,

137
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,790
you seemed

138
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,560
to have something to say, right?

139
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,840
Did I?

140
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,790
Didn't you?

141
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,200
Don't you want to know

142
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,270
why Tanyin and I

143
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,860
had a big fight that day?

144
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,080
Don't you want to know

145
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:56,910
why I used an embroidery piece

146
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,390
to seal the Ascension Platform

147
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,630
and prevented her primordial spirit

148
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,270
from returning to the Divine Realm?

149
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,870
Then what did you do?

150
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,370
Whatever I did,

151
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,750
it was all for Taihe's sake.

152
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,960
Tanyin is young.

153
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:12,940
We should help her more

154
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,200
and not let her act recklessly

155
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,610
or go astray.

156
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:18,910
Mr. Loong,

157
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:21,080
you and I have been friends for thousands of years.

158
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,960
You should know very well

159
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:26,080
that I always put Taihe first

160
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,080
and have no selfish intentions.

161
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,960
You're right. You're right.

162
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,340
The priority is to retrieve the Divine Hand

163
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:37,670
and revive Taihe.

164
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,210
Chief, they ran that way.

165
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:50,480
After them!

166
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,600
Tanyin.

167
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,080
Tanyin.

168
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:07,720
I'm here.

169
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,390
I've always been here.

170
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,200
Run.

171
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:14,960
Run.

172
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,550
Run.

173
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:20,150
I'm not going anywhere.

174
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:22,680
I'll always be with you.

175
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,720
I promised

176
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,240
to be good to you

177
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,190
and stay with you.

178
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,630
You're awake?

179
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:04,920
In a place like this,

180
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,109
you could actually sleep so soundly.

181
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,510
What's wrong with this place?

182
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,829
It shelters me from the wind and rain,

183
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,750
much better than where I used to live.

184
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:13,829
But I understand.

185
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,510
You're the commander of the Youhu Clan's War Division.

186
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,750
Naturally,

187
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,400
you're not used to places like this.

188
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,480
You're a War Demon.

189
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:25,480
So why did you help Yuanzhong?

190
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:27,160
What's wrong with being a War Demon?

191
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:27,680
War Demons

192
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,310
are sworn enemies of the Youhu Clan.

193
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,290
Is that so?

194
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,710
Then why did your clan's elder

195
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,750
join forces with our chief

196
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,750
to kill your High Priest?

197
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,310
Can you really make sense

198
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,920
of all the grudges and feuds in this world?

199
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:44,750
You're right.

200
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,750
Besides, I didn't do that for him.

201
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,350
Then who did you do it for?

202
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,550
You're talking too much.

203
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,550
Seems like you're really bored.

204
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,700
Why don't you think about how to escape instead?

205
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,000
That god gave the order.

206
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,590
I bet the whole world

207
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:03,000
is after Yuanzhong now.

208
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,510
With no help from anyone,

209
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,880
how many times can they escape?

210
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,510
Did you hear what those jailers

211
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:08,640
were saying earlier?

212
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:09,960
They said Miss Ji

213
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,680
made Yandu shrink

214
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:13,200
and then threw it out.

215
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,830
In the blink of an eye, Yandu was moved

216
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:15,790
over 250 miles.

217
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,590
Do you think that's possible?

218
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:21,480
Whether it's possible or not,

219
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,110
we'll know once we get out.

220
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,960
If that really happened,

221
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,850
she must have used divine power.

222
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,640
Zhi Dai, are you alright?

223
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,680
How did you get here?

224
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,410
Time is short. Let's talk outside.

225
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,880
With this thing restraining us,

226
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,830
we have no spiritual power.

227
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:51,640
Solve this first.

228
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:55,680
Let's go.

229
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,550
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

230
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:10,930
City Lord,

231
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,550
Tanghua has escaped.

232
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,080
What?

233
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,070
You can't escape, can you?

234
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,960
One of them

235
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,950
is the commander of the Youhu Clan's War Division,

236
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,200
and the other

237
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:42,370
is a War Demon who can fight 100 men alone.

238
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:44,240
Do you really think you can take them down

239
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,960
with these black-armored guards?

240
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,880
I'd love to give it a try.

241
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:50,160
I even dared to kill

242
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,110
the High Priest of the Youhu Clan.

243
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,000
Why should I fear them?

244
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:56,590
You're bringing disaster upon Yandu.

245
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,160
That's none of your concern,

246
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:58,920
Dai.

247
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,270
On my command.

248
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,440
Kill them all!

249
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,480
Stop!

250
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,590
Young City Lord Zhi Yue,

251
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,270
you killed your father to seize power.

252
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,400
Your crime is unforgivable.

253
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:22,440
By order of Master Yan,

254
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,200
I'm here to arrest you.

255
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:39,630
[Master Yan's Mansion]

256
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,790
Master Yan, they're here.

257
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,960
Greetings, Master Yan.

258
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:01,650
Young City Lord Zhi Dai,

259
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,680
after so many years, you still look as young as ever.

260
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,580
It's truly enviable.

261
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,440
Master Yan,

262
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,000
you've changed quite a bit.

263
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,880
If I'd seen you on the street,

264
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,510
I'm afraid I wouldn't have recognized you.

265
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:15,680
How could I not age after 50 years?

266
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,510
Unlike immortals, we humans

267
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,750
live for a short time.

268
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,350
Among my people,

269
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:22,310
I'm considered quite long-lived.

270
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,590
This must be Mr. Tanghua.

271
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,960
So it was for him

272
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:34,640
that you didn't return home for decades?

273
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,880
Master Yan.

274
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:37,200
In the past few years,

275
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:39,160
whenever your father got drunk,

276
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,090
he would come to me

277
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,870
and curse this guy for hours,

278
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,480
grumbling nonstop and swearing like a sailor.

279
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,310
Even village women quarreling

280
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:48,160
couldn't match his variety of insults.

281
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:52,000
Mr. Tanghua, please don't take offense.

282
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,920
All parents are like this.

283
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,240
No matter what foolish things their child

284
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,270
has done

285
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,000
to land them in trouble,

286
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:59,070
deep down,

287
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,590
they think it's someone else's fault.

288
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,200
It's kind of you to say that.

289
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,720
This really was my fault.

290
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,830
If he were alive

291
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:09,310
and heard you say this,

292
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:12,110
he would surely feel much better.

293
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,030
Master Yan, do you know how my father

294
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,030
died?

295
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,750
I do.

296
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,940
Did you find out afterward,

297
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,270
or did you...

298
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:25,260
I guess I saw it coming.

299
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:27,680
I know what you want to ask.

300
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,960
You've been away from home for too long.

301
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,510
You don't understand how the human race has changed.

302
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,000
Over all these years,

303
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:37,070
with the development of craftsmanship,

304
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:39,310
every trade has made progress.

305
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,680
We now have waterwheels and plows,

306
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:43,160
allowing us to grow more crops

307
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,640
and feed more people.

308
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,000
With barrel carts and tower ships,

309
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:47,560
we can now, like immortals,

310
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,990
fly through the sky and travel underground at high speeds.

311
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,200
We can now withstand floods and earthquakes,

312
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,640
split mountains, and cleave the earth.

313
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:56,270
We also have rockets and crossbows,

314
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,310
so we can hold our own even against

315
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,310
the immortal cultivators.

316
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:00,790
We've grown stronger

317
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:02,920
and more capable of protecting ourselves,

318
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,550
so naturally, our mindset has changed.

319
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,070
Your brother Zhi Yue believes

320
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,000
this is a great opportunity

321
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,720
for the human race to thrive

322
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,030
and sees the Youhu Clan as our greatest enemy.

323
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,720
So, he's been working behind the scenes,

324
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,640
using every possible means

325
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,310
to infiltrate various forces.

326
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:18,680
For all these years,

327
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,350
he's been dedicated to weakening the Youhu Clan,

328
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:23,070
waiting for the chance to destroy them.

329
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,110
What about my father?

330
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,490
Your father believed

331
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,550
our progress

332
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:29,880
was meant to protect ourselves,

333
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,070
not to invade others.

334
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,960
Young City Lord Zhi Dai,

335
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,510
who do you agree with?

336
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,270
Master Yan,

337
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,800
I've spent years wallowing in heartbreak,

338
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:45,990
losing track of time.

339
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:47,590
I went to many places

340
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:49,000
and saw countless sights.

341
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:51,000
During my travels,

342
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,410
I noticed something strange.

343
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:54,920
If a mountain

344
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:56,160
becomes overrun with wolves,

345
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:57,310
and they wipe out

346
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,750
all their enemies like tigers and leopards,

347
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,920
then soon enough,

348
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:01,480
they'll eat all the rabbits,

349
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,510
all the mice,

350
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,960
and all the food there is.

351
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,400
And when that happens,

352
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,270
they'll either move to another mountain

353
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,270
or end up

354
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,310
starving to death on that very mountain.

355
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,640
But on the contrary,

356
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,160
if a mountain

357
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,550
has wolves, tigers,

358
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,200
birds, and rabbits,

359
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:17,880
then that mountain

360
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,110
will be full of life.

361
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,920
Even the flowers, grass, and trees

362
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,400
will grow more lushly.

363
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:24,480
So?

364
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,350
Nothing in this world

365
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:27,550
exists in isolation.

366
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,070
Everything is

367
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:30,750
born into this world for a reason.

368
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:32,960
Thinking, striving,

369
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,480
and working hard to survive is not wrong.

370
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,830
But if you make eliminating rivals

371
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:38,720
and wiping out enemies

372
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,000
your primary goal,

373
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,680
you'll lose sight of what truly matters.

374
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:43,720
So, Master Yan,

375
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,030
in my view,

376
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:47,450
developing ourselves and competing without destruction

377
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,610
should be the path for the human race.

378
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:54,790
Mr. Tanghua,

379
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:56,630
you've taken quite a scolding over the years,

380
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:58,020
and honestly, you deserved it.

381
00:24:58,550 --> 00:24:59,550
You nearly stole away

382
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:01,400
the hope for the human race's revival.

383
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:03,350
City Lord was too soft-hearted.

384
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:04,350
If I were him,

385
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,670
I'd have gone to Fangwai Mountain long ago

386
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:06,850
to bring you back by force

387
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,480
and make you marry her.

388
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,530
Master Yan.

389
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:12,480
A few days ago,

390
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,960
someone said something to me.

391
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,100
She said,

392
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,310
"All things in the four seasons,

393
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,400
in their rise and fall,

394
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:24,070
will find their own path

395
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:26,640
without relying on a demon's guidance."

396
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,920
I planned to share those words

397
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:30,960
with Zhi Yue,

398
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,470
but now

399
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:35,090
I want to share them with you as well.

400
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,030
Master Yan, what are you doing?

401
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
City Lord Zhi Dai,

402
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,030
from now on,

403
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:46,760
please lead the human race

404
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,620
away from the demons' schemes

405
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:49,850
and traps,

406
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,580
and guide us toward prosperity.

407
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,920
Are you here to laugh at me

408
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:40,550
or to give me a quick end?

409
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,740
You killed Father.

410
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:49,880
Yes.

411
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:54,200
I killed Father.

412
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:58,190
I committed a heinous crime.

413
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,110
I'm unforgivable.

414
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,350
I'm different from you.

415
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,270
You're just a sentimental woman.

416
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,350
But I…

417
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,070
I spent my childhood studying and training hard,

418
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:13,270
never daring to waste a minute.

419
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,030
I did it all so that one day

420
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,350
I could become the City Lord

421
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,050
and lead the human race to greatness!

422
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,680
The War Demons are nothing.

423
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:25,640
Without me, they would've starved to death

424
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,750
in some godforsaken mountain!

425
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:31,550
The Youhu Clan is hypocritical, greedy,

426
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,310
arrogant,

427
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,270
yet short-sighted.

428
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,990
Give me just 10 more years,

429
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,550
and I could tear them apart,

430
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:41,530
leave them at my mercy,

431
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:43,750
and make the human race the rulers of it all!

432
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,310
I had everything planned.

433
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:47,750
If not for you...

434
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:49,880
I wouldn't have

435
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,350
ended up like this,

436
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,590
and I wouldn't have become a prisoner!

437
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,640
Why did you bring back

438
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,640
that pill?

439
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:00,440
Since you had the heart to leave home,

440
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,240
why did you come back?

441
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,200
You still don't repent.

442
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,310
Repent?

443
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,200
What is there to repent?

444
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,030
Since ancient times,

445
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:15,960
the world has played by the law of the jungle.

446
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,400
This is the heavenly way!

447
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:20,000
I just had bad luck.

448
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:22,400
One wrong move,

449
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:24,170
and I lost everything.

450
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,270
Fine, I lost.

451
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:27,310
I accept that.

452
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,920
Everything I did was for the human race,

453
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:32,640
so I have no regrets.

454
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,310
I don't understand.

455
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,270
No,

456
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:41,720
of course you don't understand.

457
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,350
You will never understand.

458
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,720
Zhi Yue,

459
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:51,000
though we're siblings,

460
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:53,440
we've never really spent much time together.

461
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,040
So when you wanted to kill me,

462
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:56,440
I could understand that.

463
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:59,270
But Father,

464
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,480
even to me—

465
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,310
his stubborn, rebellious daughter—

466
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:05,110
was always loving and forgiving.

467
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:06,950
I don't believe he had only been

468
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,540
harsh and strict with you.

469
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,550
Didn't he teach you

470
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:11,830
martial arts and how to read?

471
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,670
Didn't he teach you

472
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:15,210
to be a man of honor?

473
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:17,640
When you were little,

474
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:18,920
didn't he ever kiss you

475
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,960
and hold you in his arms?

476
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,920
When you were sick,

477
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:23,680
didn't he stay up all night

478
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,880
to take care of you?

479
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:27,130
So why do you,

480
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,200
after killing

481
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,110
your own father,

482
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,310
act like it was

483
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,150
the most natural thing in the world?

484
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:37,720
Father taught me to read when I was young.

485
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:40,310
We once discussed a passage about the character "human"

486
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,880
from "Explaining Graphs and Analyzing Characters."

487
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,350
It says that

488
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:44,830
humans

489
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,960
are the heart of heaven and earth,

490
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,440
the intersection of yin and yang,

491
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,200
the combination of ghosts and gods,

492
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,440
and the essence of the five elements.

493
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,370
They're the most precious existence in this world.

494
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,110
If you want to lead the human race,

495
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:01,190
you must at least know how to be a human.

496
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,160
Zhi Yue,

497
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,880
even Master Yan knows

498
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,400
what you did.

499
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,030
He knows you bore ill intentions toward Father.

500
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:12,160
Father was such a wise man.

501
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:14,160
How could he not have noticed?

502
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,680
As the Young City Lord of Yandu,

503
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,200
you may use any means

504
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,310
to achieve your goals.

505
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:21,200
But as a son,

506
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,310
you killed your own father.

507
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,030
How are you any different from a beast?

508
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,240
I won't come again.

509
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,480
Over there.

510
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:58,510
Let's go.

511
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,750
It's all my fault.

512
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:33,790
I, Li Chaoyang, Chief of the War Demons,

513
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,720
humbly ask the goddess for help.

514
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:49,480
The rich fragrance fills the heaven and earth.

515
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:52,480
This scent reaches the Gate of Heaven.

516
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:55,030
With the scent stretching thousands of miles,

517
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:57,920
I offer prayers from afar, invoking the goddess to show herself.

518
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,640
Goddess, we followed your instructions

519
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,750
and surrounded Yuanzhong to kill him.

520
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:24,370
But at the crucial moment, Ji Tanyin interfered,

521
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,400
ruining our perfect plan

522
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:27,720
and saving him.

523
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,550
Goddess, we humbly ask for your guidance.

524
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,240
We failed to kill Yuanzhong again and again.

525
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,720
Perhaps…

526
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:01,550
the goddess has abandoned us.

527
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:11,200
As long as we find him

528
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,540
and kill him,

529
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:15,000
we'll still have hope.

530
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:20,650
The War Demons will still have hope.

531
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,640
Yeah, why didn't we think of

532
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,830
bringing a tent?

533
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:46,880
It would've sheltered us from the wind and rain.

534
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,200
Miss,

535
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:50,790
our meeting must be fate.

536
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,650
May I

537
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,310
use your fire?

538
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,110
Great.

539
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:15,070
This gentleman looks quite familiar.

540
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,110
I remember now.

541
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:19,580
Back when I went to Qiguan Mountain

542
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,600
to locate a burial site,

543
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:21,590
I got lost

544
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:22,710
and saw him.

545
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:24,880
I even gave him a fortune reading for free.

546
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:25,960
Unfortunately,

547
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,840
he didn't appear

548
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,960
to believe me at the time.

549
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:33,100
I have water here

550
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:33,960
and some hot soup too.

551
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:35,949
If you don't mind,

552
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:36,730
you're welcome to take some.

553
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:37,590
No, thanks.

554
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:43,489
Your friend

555
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,510
seems to be badly injured.

556
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,880
This pot of Ten-Tonic Soup

557
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,760
is what I use for health and longevity.

558
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,510
It can help with his condition.

559
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:59,370
The bamboo here is quite special.

560
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,070
It has an unusual fragrance,

561
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:02,810
which is why this place is called Fragrant Grove.

562
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,230
During the day, it's normal,

563
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:05,590
but once night falls,

564
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:07,920
it releases a mist

565
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:09,900
that makes it easy to get lost

566
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,080
and hard to find a way out.

567
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,070
I've been stuck here

568
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:15,280
for a full 10 days now.

569
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,960
If you could go out during the day,

570
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:18,110
why didn't you leave?

571
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:19,690
Good question!

572
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,670
That day, I read my fortunes,

573
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:23,510
and the reading kept pointing to this place.

574
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:24,590
The reading told me

575
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:26,110
I should stay here for 10 days.

576
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,840
But in the past 9 days,

577
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,170
no one came, and nothing happened.

578
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,880
On the very last day,

579
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,230
you guys showed up.

580
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:33,960
It must be fate.

581
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:35,920
Oh right,

582
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,630
I haven't done today's reading yet.

583
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:39,150
I'll just read your fortunes.

584
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,760
Gods, enlighten me.

585
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:58,040
Looks like it's going to be

586
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,580
the Five-Star Heavenly Divination!

587
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:06,230
It's done!

588
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:07,760
Miss,

589
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,480
you can ask five questions.

590
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,360
This is the Five-Star Heavenly Divination.

591
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:16,310
Many fortune tellers could never perform this divination

592
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,900
throughout their whole lives.

593
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:19,480
I have nothing to ask.

594
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:21,100
I started this divination for you.

595
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:23,020
Don't waste it.

596
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:26,080
How about this? I'll ask on your behalf.

597
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:30,190
How is this young lady's fortune?

598
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,000
Miss, you're pretty unlucky.

599
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:38,000
But hey,

600
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,300
bad luck isn't the end of the world.

601
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,720
We can always ask about something else,

602
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,360
right?

603
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,110
You two are a couple, aren't you?

604
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:44,910
How about I ask about your relationship?

605
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:47,280
The result can't be too bad this time.

606
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,020
Will this young couple

607
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:52,200
have a happy ending?

608
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,150
The hexagram of Meng.

609
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:58,250
Gen is mountain, and Kan is water.

610
00:36:58,350 --> 00:36:59,580
This hexagram means...

611
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,320
Oh no.

612
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,800
What does it mean?

613
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:05,710
It means a mountain beside a river.

614
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:08,190
Normally, it signifies going through thick and thin together.

615
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,670
If I had only asked

616
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:11,090
about your love life

617
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,510
or his love life,

618
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:15,360
it would've been an auspicious sign.

619
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,710
But the problem is

620
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:18,670
I asked about you as a couple.

621
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:19,670
So the meaning has changed.

622
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:21,480
The mountain is close to the river, but they never truly meet.

623
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,230
You're destined…

624
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:25,190
to part ways.

625
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:28,950
Blood!

626
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:32,400
Could it be a backlash?

627
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:44,340
Miss, don't take it to heart.

628
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,530
You still have a chance.

629
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:46,440
Let me ask about

630
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:48,110
how to remedy it.

631
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,150
May I ask myself?

632
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:51,320
Of course.

633
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,400
That's even better.

634
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,920
I have a friend who is severely injured

635
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,510
and has been in a coma for a long time.

636
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:02,290
I want to know

637
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:03,670
when he will wake up.

638
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,400
How is this possible?

639
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:17,590
I'm fine.

640
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,590
What does this hexagram mean?

641
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,670
Heaven's secrets cannot be revealed.

642
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:24,840
To reveal them is to invite death.

643
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:28,850
Perhaps

644
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,990
I can give you some hints.

645
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,550
Please, go ahead.

646
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:35,370
The hexagram shows a turning millstone.

647
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,920
Just go with the flow.

648
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,770
Don't hesitate to do good things.

649
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,930
Rushing things…

650
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:43,480
will only lead to mistakes.

651
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,360
Why can't I even give hints?

652
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,590
Do you mean...

653
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:52,090
Don't ask! Don't say anything.

654
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:00,190
This hexagram has passed.

655
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:02,670
You have two questions left.

656
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:07,920
I want to know if Yuanzhong

657
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,190
can make it through this crisis.

658
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:20,910
I didn't ask that.

659
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:25,070
Why am I punished?

660
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:30,550
You can't answer that question either, right?

661
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,470
I'm glad you understand.

662
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:33,920
Thank you.

663
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:37,500
You have one last question.

664
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:39,320
Wait.

665
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:41,030
Please don't ask any questions

666
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:42,050
that may get me killed.

667
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:46,480
I want to know

668
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:48,960
how Yuanzhong will end.

669
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:51,180
I asked that question

670
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,400
for him before.

671
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,880
Everything will go smoothly for him.

672
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:25,440
You're awake.

673
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:32,050
I've been awake for a while.

674
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:34,360
You…

675
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,630
What happened to your eyes?

676
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,630
I was hit by a hidden weapon from the human race.

677
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,960
It's temporary.

678
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,070
Don't worry.

679
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:54,700
I have the Divine Left Hand.

680
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,670
It can heal any injury.

681
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:58,590
I'll be fine in a few days.

682
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:14,480
Thank you for everything

683
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,480
you did along the way.

684
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:18,920
Don't mention it.

685
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:21,190
Don't worry about me.

686
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:23,440
I'll be fine in a few days.

687
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,550
We're

688
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:30,800
in Fragrant Grove, right?

689
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:40,450
You woke up twice while you were unconscious.

690
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,590
You gave me directions.

691
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,440
Then we're at the right place.

692
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,480
Mind your step.

693
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,400
A friend of mine

694
00:41:57,830 --> 00:41:59,100
lives in Fragrant Grove.

695
00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:01,610
She's skilled in creating barriers.

696
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:03,130
We can stay here

697
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:03,970
for a while.

698
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:10,530
Stop hiding.

699
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:11,930
Come out.
