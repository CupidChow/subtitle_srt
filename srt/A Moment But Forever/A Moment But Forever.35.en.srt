[A Moment But Forever]

2
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,310
[Episode 35]

3
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,870
He's waiting for someone.

4
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,039
And I

5
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,840
am also waiting.

6
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,420
We'll split up into two groups.

7
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,120
Mei Shan and I will launch an attack on the front gate

8
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,680
to keep the Demon Lord and Hannv occupied,

9
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,680
preventing them from descending the mountain

10
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,750
and causing chaos in the world.

11
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,120
Qian Lin and Zhi Dai will lead the human warriors

12
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,150
to assault Tianqu Peak

13
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,590
and rescue Tanghua and the others.

14
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,400
Yes.

15
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,079
Yes.

16
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,240
I'm now counting on you all.

17
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,310
Swear to eradicate the Demon Lord!

18
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,400
Swear to eradicate the Demon Lord!

19
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,590
Swear to eradicate the Demon Lord!

20
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,630
Swear to eradicate the Demon Lord!

21
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:01,560
Swear to eradicate the Demon Lord!

22
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,680
Swear to eradicate the Demon Lord!

23
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,360
Elder Xinyao.

24
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,079
How's your injury?

25
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,190
I'm fine.

26
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,910
Who dares to make a scene here?

27
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,360
Ji Tanyin,

28
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,070
you're still alive.

29
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,720
Do you know each other?

30
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,390
No.

31
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,560
You insolent fool,

32
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,560
I have received enlightenment from the Lord,

33
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,040
and my powers have greatly increased.

34
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,920
If you don't want to die by my hand,

35
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,430
you'd better leave now.

36
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,170
You're no match for me.

37
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,000
You won't be able to kill them all.

38
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,190
Hurry up and go up the mountain!

39
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,040
Let's go!

40
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:12,720
Let's go!

41
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,270
Go down the mountain!

42
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,360
Powerful enemies are invading!

43
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,510
Powerful enemies are invading!

44
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,160
Hurry!

45
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,360
Wait.

46
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,159
Don't fall for the trap meant to distract us.

47
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:43,600
Take a team and head to the dungeon.

48
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,390
Keep an eye on the prisoners.

49
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,630
The rest of you, follow me.

50
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:46,560
Come with me,

51
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,510
I'll hold them off here.

52
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,510
You go in and rescue the others.

53
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,040
Don't even try it.

54
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:43,909
Zhi Dai!

55
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:46,600
Young Master.

56
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,600
Everyone, hurry up and leave!

57
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,310
Go!

58
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,920
We'll stay here.

59
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,360
You and Tanghua, go help Ji Tanyin.

60
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,600
The rest of you, leave quickly.

61
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:14,800
Alright, let's go!

62
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:41,000
You really are lucky.

63
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,270
Even the Heavenly Furnace

64
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,830
couldn't burn you away.

65
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,360
Back to die again?

66
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,070
I'm sending you to your grave.

67
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,270
Sir, your skills are remarkable.

68
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,310
Do you ever consider defecting to the light?

69
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,430
You, a god, serve the demon,

70
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,190
yet still dare to call yourself righteous?

71
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:09,270
I didn't ask for your opinion.

72
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,480
Sir,

73
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,950
I've given you a chance.

74
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:13,760
What will you choose?

75
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,720
Your heart is tainted,

76
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,870
and you can't tell right from wrong.

77
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,750
I don't want to deal with people like you.

78
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,600
Rough and crude.

79
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,480
No wonder you haven't ascended to godhood yet.

80
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,360
Since you refuse to follow the righteous path,

81
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,870
I'll send you to hell.

82
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,720
You foolish, clueless thing.

83
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,840
Do you think I can't kill you?

84
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,270
I've always looked down on you.

85
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,000
You're a god, yet you refuse to act like one,

86
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,870
becoming a servant to the demon.

87
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:17,550
Watch out!

88
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,790
What incredible power!

89
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:24,550
I'm going in.

90
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:25,510
Hold her off for me.

91
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:26,240
Don't worry.

92
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,200
Go ahead.

93
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:28,840
Even if the sky falls today,

94
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,240
I'll hold it up for you.

95
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:33,320
Don't leave!

96
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,630
You didn't die?

97
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:50,200
Do you think I've withstood decades of heavenly thunder

98
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:50,960
for nothing?

99
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,240
Your magic is indeed powerful,

100
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,000
but compared to the lightning tribulation,

101
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,480
it still falls short.

102
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,320
You reckless fool, just go to hell!

103
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,790
Disturbing people's peaceful rest,

104
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,390
you have no sense of decency.

105
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,870
You've taken someone else's body

106
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,240
and palace.

107
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,670
Don't act like you're following the rules.

108
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:24,440
Good.

109
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,030
Well said.

110
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,360
Since I was born,

111
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,200
I don't know what the rules are.

112
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:34,150
There's no one else here.

113
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,600
Why don't you teach me?

114
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,030
You seem nervous.

115
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:44,840
I can sense

116
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,240
your blood racing.

117
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,480
You've lost your divine bone,

118
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,380
yet you still dared to come to me.

119
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,920
Your courage is commendable.

120
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,200
Cut the crap.

121
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,270
Even if I'm not a god,

122
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,480
I'll still kill you.

123
00:10:58,910 --> 00:10:59,910
You were born from the evil thoughts

124
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:00,910
of the Deity Taihe.

125
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,720
You enjoy slaughter and chaos.

126
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,270
You must be enjoying

127
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,030
the scene outside right now, aren't you?

128
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:07,600
Yes,

129
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,480
but it's not all of it.

130
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,870
Actually, aside from those,

131
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,600
there's one thing

132
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:19,360
I'm very curious about.

133
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,270
What is it?

134
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,790
You.

135
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,510
Since my rebirth,

136
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,360
I've slept very little.

137
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,480
Counting just now,

138
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,720
it's only been three times.

139
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,910
But in all three instances,

140
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,630
I've dreamt of you every time.

141
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:42,440
I know,

142
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,440
this isn't my feelings;

143
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,920
it's the body's—

144
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,980
Yuanzhong's.

145
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,200
I'm just curious,

146
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:53,360
how could someone like you,

147
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,510
an ordinary woman,

148
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:59,200
make him so reluctant

149
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,680
to part with you?

150
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:06,910
Yes.

151
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,630
Even your temper is so bad.

152
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,840
A woman like you,

153
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:13,870
and yet he's willing to

154
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,480
cut off his Divine Hand

155
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,030
and even die for you.

156
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,180
Is it worth it?

157
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:28,040
It's a pity you can't see it.

158
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,670
In those dreams,

159
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,120
you were so beautiful,

160
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,080
so sweet that it seemed to melt away

161
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,200
all the world's grudges and grievances.

162
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,480
You were perfect,

163
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,510
perfect to the point...

164
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:46,910
Perfect to the point

165
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,630
of being sickening.

166
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,820
The world knows me as a demon,

167
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:59,580
but they don't know the suffering in my heart.

168
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,680
Thousands of years have passed,

169
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,320
and I've always had just one dream.

170
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,550
In that dream,

171
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,140
I see the world I desire.

172
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,240
There,

173
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:16,400
all those who once held their heads high

174
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,030
now crawl and kneel before me,

175
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,390
pitifully beneath me.

176
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,010
All those who were once untouchable

177
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,510
are worthless as dirt,

178
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,960
miserably so.

179
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,510
All those who once ruled over all

180
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,000
are now wagging their tails and begging,

181
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,270
waiting for a favor.

182
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:33,030
And those who once sat upright,

183
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,870
now show all their ugly traits,

184
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,240
decaying and desolate.

185
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,270
I want,

186
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,240
I want that kind of world.

187
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,840
I want the innocent to shed their garments.

188
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,200
I want the loyal to be forsaken by all.

189
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:47,320
I want the compassionate to consume their own flesh.

190
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,720
I want the gentle to be torn and shattered.

191
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,720
I want to tear apart

192
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,030
the endless filthy lies

193
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,670
and the shameless disguises

194
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:56,960
that hide the sun.

195
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,630
I want people

196
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:01,550
to face the evil thoughts deep in their hearts,

197
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:03,910
to recognize reality.

198
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:06,000
Everyone is a demon.

199
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:06,870
A demon

200
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,270
is the truest desire of the human heart.

201
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,360
Ji Tanyin,

202
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,790
I didn't come out of nowhere.

203
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,150
I was born from the human heart.

204
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:25,660
So,

205
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,840
humans are demons.

206
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,910
Can you cut them all down?

207
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:34,000
You're a madman.

208
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,360
If I weren't,

209
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,960
how could I be called the Demon Lord?

210
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:38,750
But you,

211
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:41,770
you've entered a madman's dream,

212
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,360
aren't you the one in the wrong?

213
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,080
Those sweet, beautiful delusions

214
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,070
replaced my dreams,

215
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:16,440
leaving me feeling disgusted and torn.

216
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,200
Tell me,

217
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,670
how should I punish

218
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,480
you, the person in my dream?

219
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,120
Do you think I'll kill you?

220
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,720
That would be too easy for you.

221
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,240
I want to destroy you.

222
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:40,480
I want to see

223
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,960
what's hidden

224
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,600
beneath your perfect goddess appearance.

225
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,510
I want to taste every bit of you,

226
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,600
strip you down, piece by piece,

227
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,440
drop by drop.

228
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:51,330
Humiliation, torment, devourment—

229
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,000
I want you to never be able to reincarnate!

230
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,200
Don't be afraid.

231
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,320
Maybe

232
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,030
you'll enjoy it.

233
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:35,810
Yuanzhong.

234
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:37,960
Yuanzhong!

235
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,630
Yuanzhong!

236
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,790
Yuanzhong!

237
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:47,510
Ji Tanyin, we're here.

238
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,750
With that alone, you dare to call yourself the Perfect War Demon?

239
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,369
You're really embarrassing the War Demons.

240
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:22,750
Traitor!

241
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,349
You have no right to speak in front of me.

242
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:26,510
Traitor?

243
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,200
You are the traitor!

244
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,030
Even though our clan was severely wounded

245
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:31,830
in the Battle of Pinghu sixty years ago,

246
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:33,960
we never considered turning to the demons.

247
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,160
You, as the Chief,

248
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,270
allowed others to control you.

249
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,480
The fault lies with you.

250
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:38,720
You say I'm wrong?

251
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,480
How laughable.

252
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,400
Our clan fought to survive,

253
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,350
and now we're flourishing,

254
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,960
all thanks to my efforts.

255
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,830
You call that living?

256
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,310
What do the current War Demons

257
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,310
have left,

258
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,240
if not anger

259
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,590
and a hunger for bloodshed?

260
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,240
You say they're living,

261
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:57,510
but to me, they're just walking,

262
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,550
flesh-and-blood puppets.

263
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,920
Better off dead.

264
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,350
How many people did you sacrifice

265
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,830
for your grand cause?

266
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:07,350
You keep talking about your achievements,

267
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,000
but to you, they're just a small footnote in the clan records,

268
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,590
insignificant while writing about

269
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,880
your glorious life.

270
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,720
They were all living people!

271
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,640
But you snuffed that out,

272
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,790
turning them into

273
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:19,000
stepping stones

274
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,200
for your dream.

275
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,960
But you never saw it.

276
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,780
The path you paved all along

277
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:25,610
leads to destruction.

278
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,790
You want to kneel at the feet of the Demon Lord,

279
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:28,920
to bow and submit,

280
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,880
but once the Demon Lord's enemies are wiped out,

281
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,920
do you think he'll leave you alive?

282
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:38,720
If you crave the power of others,

283
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,600
you'll forever be controlled by them.

284
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:42,930
If you constantly set limits on yourself,

285
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,920
you'll forget your true self.

286
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,240
How foolish!

287
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,030
Shiren.

288
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,250
When you see my mother and brother,

289
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,160
remember to ask for their forgiveness.

290
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,030
Dingxu.

291
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,000
Take that!

292
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,270
Zhi Dai, how are you?

293
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,480
Hang in there.

294
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:26,110
Tanghua,

295
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,440
I'm sorry.

296
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,240
Quiet now,

297
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,150
focus on your breathing.

298
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,480
Don't waste your efforts on it.

299
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:39,270
Even without this strike,

300
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,950
I'd still meet my end.

301
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:43,750
Don't say that.

302
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,750
I'm just dying

303
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:50,610
from old age.

304
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:58,120
♫I gaze into your deep eyes♫

305
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:03,320
♫For whom do you take apart the word "love"?♫

306
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:09,490
♫Turning around, it's like a dream♫

Do you remember?

309
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:17,670
I spent many years searching for you.

310
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,960
♫Heaving a long, helpless sigh♫

311
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,350

♫Time flies too rapidly♫

313
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:24,000
and my hair turned grey

314
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,680
that I found you.

315
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:28,270
I remember.

316
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:31,350
♫Life is like a flying bird♫

317

♫Joining, scattering, no way back♫

318
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,550
After that,

319
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:39,400
I met a goddess.

320
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,140
♫Unable to get what I yearn for, I sink in sadness♫

321
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:42,200
She fulfilled one of my wishes,

322
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:44,200
and I regained my youth.

323
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,690
♫When I brush past love, fate is set♫

324
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,310
That goddess

325
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:50,200
was the one who wanted to kill Yuanzhong.

326
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,920
♫I've used up my brush and ink♫

327
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:53,920

♫I couldn't describe♫

♫After the farewell, where are you now?♫

333
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,920

♫Who do you spend your days with?♫

335
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,880
and asked me to deliver a message

336
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:06,960

♫Do you know I'm willing to wait for you until the end?♫

338

Don't say anymore.

00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:10,640

and then, step by step,

345
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,750
I fell deeper.

346
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:21,590
I was so foolish.

347
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:26,110
Now, with the Demon Lord reborn,

348
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,880
bringing chaos to the world,

349
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:29,870

♫People are not as they were in this lifetime♫

377
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:11,350
You finally came.

378
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,890
I knew it.

379
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:14,270
She would definitely come.

380
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:16,830
Now, you look much more pleasing to the eye.

381
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:18,400
Ji Tanyin,

382
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,880
can you still recognize me?

383
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:21,590
You're Xiu.

384
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,880
Yes, it's me.

385
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:24,160
Where's Yuanzhong?

386
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,440
He's inside.

387
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,400
The Demon Lord took over his body,

388
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:27,720
severely damaging his spiritual consciousness.

389
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,310
The five of us

390
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:29,850
are guarding his lingering consciousness here.

391
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,920
But the Demon Lord's devouring power

392
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,830
is too strong.

393
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,200
We can't hold on much longer.

394
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:35,240
Yuanzhong is in a very dangerous situation right now.

395
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:36,680
His consciousness is in a state that is half-dream, half-awake;

396
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,960
half-life, half-death.

397
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,790
We've already reached the limits of our strength.

398
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:42,270
If we cannot wake him,

399
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,830
he will be completely consumed by the Demon Lord,

400
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,480
and both body and soul will perish.

401
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,960
I will wake him up.

402
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:54,590
Go ahead.

403
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,270
Yuanzhong.

404
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,200
Yuanzhong.

405
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,790
Wake up, Yuanzhong.

406
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,480
It's me, Tanyin.

407
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,240
I've come to save you.

408
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,480
You're in danger right now.

409
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,510
You can't fall asleep.

410
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,240
Please, wake up.

411
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,200
Yuanzhong.

412
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,240
Are you angry with me?

413
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,000
You can hear me,

414
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,030
right, Yuanzhong?

415
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:34,830
Wake up, Yuanzhong.

416
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:40,160
Guard it!

417
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:52,110
♫Ask the heavens♫

418
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:54,130
♫I don't know why I'm without a home♫

419
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,400
♫I'm at a dead end♫

420
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,210
♫And I have to surrender and accept my destiny♫

421
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,960
♫I'm the wandering one♫

422
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:00,790
♫My body and mind, falling into dust♫

423
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:02,810
♫Only the moon in the sky♫

424
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,330
♫Shines upon the lifelong decay♫

425
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,460
♫The scars you can't see♫

426
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,480
The soul lamp is about to extinguish.

427
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:08,360
♫Are the proof of my struggle♫

428
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,310
Everyone,

429
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,240
now is the time.

430
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,150
♫Be your own last straw of hope♫

431
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,830
Though this life is brief,

432
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,850
♫Why do you have to go alone?♫

433
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,480
I find some satisfaction

434
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,450
♫Let me learn to be fearless♫

435
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:15,150
♫I live with no regrets♫

436
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,960
in dying alongside all of you.

437
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:16,540
♫Who deserves to be crushed?♫

438
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,240
Indeed, it's quite a relief.

439
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:19,060
♫Don't tell me what's right or wrong♫

440
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,720
It's a pity we don't have wine.

441
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:19,880
No wine is better.

442
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,840
♫I rebel against fate♫

443
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:20,880
At this time,

444
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,440
who would want to hear your drunken words?

445
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,160
True.

446
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:25,700
♫I'm willing to risk my life♫

447
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:24,920
If we can't come sober,

448
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:26,720
at least we should leave sober.

449
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:28,460
♫No matter how dangerous it is♫

450
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,720
Well said.

451
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,920
Then let's all go together.

452
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:32,460
♫I will travel the world and scatter the fog♫

453
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,110
The Heavenly Way above,

454
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:35,500
♫The flowing water does not compete for the lead♫

455
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,400
I am clear and pure.

456
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,830
In the dark void of thought,

457
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:39,240
♫For millennia, all will turn to dust♫

458
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,270
I wish to uphold the law.

459
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,820
In the vast universe,

460
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,640
the power of Heaven is vast.

461
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:42,500
♫With our feet on the earth and the sky above♫

462
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:42,070
Today, I offer my body,

463
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:43,590
to reject the demon with my flesh.

464
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:46,250
♫We, the heroes of our time, are no ordinary beings♫

465
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,920
Today, I offer my body,

466
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,110
to reject the demon with my flesh.

467
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:49,080
♫The flowing water does not compete for the lead♫

468
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,640
Today, I offer my body,

469
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,030
to reject the demon with my flesh.

470
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:52,670
♫In my heart, there are no ripples, as if a god resides within♫

471
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:56,170
♫I ride the wind and embrace the moon♫

472
00:27:56,270 --> 00:28:00,260
♫The raging river in my dreams has never ceased♫

473
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:02,340
♫The flowing water does not compete for the lead♫
♫I want to be like the flowing rivers, lakes, and seas♫

474

♫The flowing water does not compete for the lead♫
♫Vast and surging♫

475
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,720
Yuanzhong.

476
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:05,640
♫In my heart, there are no ripples, as if a god resides within♫
♫Love, hatred, gratitude, or grudges♫

477
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,290
♫In my heart, there are no ripples, as if a god resides within♫
♫While disputes and entanglements repeated countless times♫

478
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:09,320
♫I ride the wind and embrace the moon♫
♫I want to conquer the world without struggle♫

479
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,520
♫I ride the wind and embrace the moon♫

480
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,320
♫The raging river in my dreams has never ceased♫
♫Able to take on and let go, neither arrogant nor impatient♫

481

♫The raging river in my dreams has never ceased♫
♫Only a steady stream can be considered humble♫

482
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:19,590
Yuanzhong.

483
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,640
In the past, you always asked me who I was,

484
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,480
where I came from,

485
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:28,850
and why I came here.

486
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,260
I always avoided answering.

487
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:33,790
Now I'm going to tell you.

488
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:36,960
You must listen carefully.

489
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,880
My name is Ji Tanyin.

490
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,980
I am the God of Craft, bestowed by Heaven.

491
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:46,920
My title is "Wushuang."

492
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,790
Actually, we met

493
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:01,880
a long time ago.

494
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:05,480
At that time, I was severely injured,

495
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,090
frozen in the Wu Mountain.

496
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:09,910
You were the one who shattered the thick ice

497
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,960
and awakened me.

498
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,110
Back then,

499
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,640
you were still

500
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,230
a little fox,

501
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,860
who took away half of my jade token.

502
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,030
Look,

503
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,200
I still have half of it here.

504
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:31,240
Open your eyes and take a look,

505
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,070
alright?

506
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,440
It's one with your half.

507
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:38,750
You should be able to recognize it.

508
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:50,110
At that time, I was severely injured,

509
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,030
deaf and mute.

510
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:55,350
You made a wish to the jade token.

511
00:29:57,650 --> 00:29:58,970
That was the only voice

512
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I could hear back then.

513
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,030
You told me

514
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:10,860
that it would take twelve days

515
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:13,540
to walk from Dawan to Pingzhou.

516
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:16,960
You said practicing magic was difficult,

517
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:19,270
but learning Taoism was faster.

518
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:22,310
You said the food in the clan wasn't enough,

519
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,590
so you often woke up hungry in the middle of the night.

520
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,590
You also said

521
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,270
you wanted to grow up quickly,

522
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,920
so you could protect your family.

523
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:38,180
Do you remember, Yuanzhong?

524
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:50,790
Later, I came

525
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:51,830
to your side.

526
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,100
In the war between gods and demons,

527
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:58,830
Deity Taihe,

528
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:00,640
having lost the Divine Left Hand,

529
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,440
fell into a deep slumber.

530
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,400
They told me

531
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,030
only by retrieving the Divine Hand

532
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,510
could Taihe wake up.

533
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:33,330
They said you were a bad person,

534
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:37,470
said you stole the divine artifact,

535
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,400
said you imprisoned all the clans,

536
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:43,000
said you were cruel and brutal,

537
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:44,240
said you deserved to die.

538
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:44,960
But you are not.

539
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,480
You are not like that.

540
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,830
You've endured so much injustice

541
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:50,480
and swallowed so much pain,

542
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:53,430
yet you never harmed anyone.

543
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:56,680
You're not.

544
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,510
If I take the Divine Hand,

545
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:00,640
you will die.

546
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,480
But I don't want you to die.

547
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:05,000
So I could only

548
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,750
agree to the three conditions of the Thunder Gods.

549
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,480
I couldn't reveal to you

550
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,920
my true identity.

551
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,200
I couldn't let you

552
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:19,510
use the Divine Left Hand to harm the world.

553
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:24,640
Also, I couldn't fall in love with you.

554
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:26,850
Only in this way

555
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,110
could I stay by your side

556
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,880
and accompany you through this life,

557
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:35,880
then take the Divine Hand back to the Divine Realm.

558
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,550
Only in this way

559
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,070
could I fight for

560
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:41,880
a glimmer of hope for you.

561
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,310
But Yuanzhong, I didn't expect...

562
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,000
I didn't expect

563
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,480
that in the end, this would harm you.

564
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,000
In the past, I was bound by the oath and couldn't tell you.

565
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,750
I also didn't have the courage to speak.

566
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,720
But now, at this point,

567
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,270
there's nothing left

568
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,680
for me to hide.

569
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,680
Now, I want to tell you something.

570
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,240
Listen carefully.

571
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,790
I love you.

572
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,790
I love you so much.

573
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:23,820
You are the only person I've loved

574
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,830
in both my human and divine lives,

575
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:26,310
across all these millennia.

576
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,000
You are obsessive

577
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:30,010
but also forgiving.

578
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
You are fierce

579
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:34,000
but also compassionate.

580
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:35,920
Your heart is filled with

581
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,240
anger and resentment,

582
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,480
but in the final moment,

583
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,240
you were able to let go of your hatred.

584
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,720
The world treats you with evil,

585
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:46,280
♫Time never defeats the fleeting world♫

586
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:46,440
but you return it with kindness.

587
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,670
♫Stars turn, shining upon the passing traveler♫

588
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,400
Someone like that

589
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:51,400
is worthy of my love.

590
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:54,130
♫The wind rises, flowers fall and bloom again♫

591
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:57,530
♫Awaiting what's lost to be regained♫

592
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,120
♫These countless sorrows and joys♫

593
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:05,990
♫Dusk and dawn, only you make parting hard♫

594
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,070
You are exactly that kind of person.

595
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:12,690
♫I'm willing to risk my life for this♫

596
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,630
I've looked into your heart and seen it.

597
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,400
You are the kind of person

598
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:15,280
♫Wind chimes beat with my heart♫

599
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,150
who can bloom amidst the icy snow.

600
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,110
So you never give up,

601
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:19,050
♫Harmonizing, can you recognize it?♫

602
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:18,550
and you won't give up.

603
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,760
Wake up, Yuanzhong.

604
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,260
♫Fingertips tracing your outline♫

605
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,070
Please wake up quickly.

606
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:26,409
♫I wish to see through you♫

607
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,070
I once met a sorcerer.

608
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:30,400
♫Whether near or far♫

609
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:30,280
He said you would live a peaceful and long life.

610
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,429
He claimed his divination was spot-on,

611
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:35,400
♫We can still gaze upon the same galaxy♫

612
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,110
so you will wake up,

613
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:34,880
won't you?

614
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,000
Yuanzhong.

615
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:40,960
♫Knowing we've never been apart for a moment♫

616
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:37,800
Yuanzhong.

617
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,000
Wake up, please.

618
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:41,510
Yuanzhong.

619
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:45,010
♫If our promise♫

620
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:49,489
♫Is to share this land and rivers♫

621
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:52,380
♫If fate leads us astray♫

622
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:56,449
♫Life and death become our bond♫

623
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:55,480
No.

624
00:34:56,850 --> 00:34:59,570
♫Storms heal with time♫

625
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,920
Yuanzhong, I won't allow you to die!

626
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,030
Yuanzhong!

627
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:04,870
♫Memories will shine in the end♫

628
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:02,030
Yuanzhong!

629

♫That very first heartbeat, I will remember until the last♫

630
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,190
♫If our promise♫

♫That very first heartbeat, I will remember until the last♫

639
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:09,960
Is he dead?

640
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,590
What a pity.

641
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:46,740
Get lost!

642
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,880
What nonsense are you talking about?

643
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,280
I have ascended to divinity

644
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,550
for three thousand years.

645
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:55,610
Can you withstand the strength of my power?

646
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,190
Are you feeling very sad?

647
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,250
He's dead.

648
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:09,550
This is actually great news.

649
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,140
Let me take some time

650
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:12,760
to think it through.

651
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,030
How should I thank you?

652
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:16,440
Give him back to me.

653
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:17,670
Give him back to you?

654
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:20,360
I am him.

655
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,510
I'm giving you the privilege to follow me. Sounds good?

656
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:24,030
Give Yuanzhong back to me!

657
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,220
Don't you love me anymore?

658
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:48,510
Don't you want to

659
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:49,590
be with me anymore?

660
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:51,110
Give Yuanzhong back to me.

661
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:53,800
I can sense

662
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,760
the power of resentment within you,

663
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,230
but this hatred isn't deep

664
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:58,110
or strong enough.

665
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,960
Let me help you out.

666
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,840
You lost your divine bone, broke your vow,

667
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,070
and caused the death of your lover.

668
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,840
Why are you still alive?

669
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,480
What are you struggling for?

670
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:14,480
Qian Yue!

671
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,280
You brought this upon yourself.

672
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,070
Yuanzhong.

673
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,760
I'm back.

674
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:30,130
You're not dead?

675
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,470
You look so disappointed.

676
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:35,900
Since you're still alive,

677
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:38,000
then I'll kill you again.

678
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:39,880
This is the realm of my spiritual consciousness.

679
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,400
In here,

680
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,960
I have control over everything in heaven and earth.

681
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,760
Yet you want to kill me here?

682
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:21,320
Is this the primordial power?

683
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,760
This is the power of salvation.

684
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:25,520
You will never understand.

685
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:23,140
♫Going through thousands of years♫

686
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:27,090
♫In exchange for a dreamlike love♫

687
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:30,890
♫If the wind is all yours♫

688
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:35,110
♫No bitterness in your expression♫

689
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:38,560
♫Everyone comes without a match♫

690
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:43,200
♫Why are they willing to be gentle?♫

691
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:47,310
♫Under the clouds, the good days♫

♫Come and go in a flash♫

693
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:56,800
♫Like the wind and moon, I'm filled with love♫

694
00:41:57,050 --> 00:42:00,490
♫But it makes people go to the end of the world♫

695
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:04,790
♫Willingly going through dawn and dusk♫

696
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:08,380
♫To embrace you and listen to the rain♫

697
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:12,280
♫Only then can I know what is memorable♫

698
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:16,380
♫When I can only look back at you♫

699
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:20,500
♫If there's still a way to continue♫

700
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:25,430

♫I'll go no matter what♫

702

How ignorant.
