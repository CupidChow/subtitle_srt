[A Moment But Forever]

00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,289
[Episode 11]

3
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,310
We had Goddess Wushuang.

4
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,590
We had craftsmanship!

5
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:52,470
It was she who showed us

6
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:53,789
a new way to survive,

7
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,310
allowing us to protect ourselves,

8
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,190
defend against enemies,

9
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,590
and live with dignity!

10
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:58,509
But you...

11
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,150
you abandoned this path.

12
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,430
You cut off your own lifeline,

13
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:07,190
giving up the great legacy

14
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,509
of our predecessors!

15
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:09,860
This is betrayal!

16
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:18,790
Today,

17
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:21,590
if I can take the immortal from the Youhu Clan

18
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,240
down with me,

19
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,230
I'd call it a win!

20
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,829
There are many others on the ship.

21
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,190
They're all innocent!

22
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,190
Guess they're unlucky.

23
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,510
But killing them like this

24
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:34,020
is better than letting them suffer

25
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,190
under the oppression of the immortal race!

26
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,230
Miss, I can see your craftsmanship is great.

27
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:44,310
That mechanical bird of yours

28
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,660
can save your life.

29
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:46,910
After you escape,

30
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,350
make sure to spread the word

31
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:50,590
about what happened today.

32
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,070
Let it serve as a warning to the world

33
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,829
so our efforts won't be in vain.

34
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,390
No, I'm just...

35
00:02:57,829 --> 00:02:59,230
You must not reveal

36
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:00,670
your identity to anyone.

37
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:03,550
If you do, your divine soul will be destroyed.

38
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,590
Let's go!

39
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,780
Yuanzhong, I'll go hold the ship.

40
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:44,910
You use the power of the Divine Hand

41
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,030
to provide power to the ship.

42
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,710
Make sure it lands safely.

43
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,590
Stop!

44
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:22,420
It's alright now.

45
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:23,740
We all survived.

46
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:24,710
It's okay now.

47
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:26,190
Slow down. Guys, slow down.

48
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,670
We survived.

49
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:28,790
We survived.

50
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:31,230
Great!

51
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,150
Great!

52
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,430
We survived!

53
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:40,630
It has stopped.

54
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,150
The tower ship has stopped.

55
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,360
Yuanzhong, do it now!

56
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:12,590
Do it now!

57
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:14,700
Do it!

58
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,350
Do it!

59
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,670
Do it!

60
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:57,310
Are we safe now?

61
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,430
We're saved, we're saved.

62
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,030
We're really safe now.

63
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,820
It's all over.

64
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:34,870
The ship stopped falling.

65
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,470
Have you two heard?

66
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:54,670
A couple of days ago,

67
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:57,390
a tower ship crashed at Bailiping.

68
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,350
Really?

69
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:01,310
I heard it belonged to the Shen family from Yandu.

70
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,310
The Shen family?

71
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:03,470
If the ship crashed,

72
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:05,420
doesn't that mean everyone on board died?

73
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:07,670
That's the strange part.

74
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,310
I heard that

75
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,470
there was an immortal

76
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:14,350
from the Youhu Clan on board.

77
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,590
That immortal,

78
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:16,590
unable to bear the sight

79
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:18,310
of so many innocent lives being lost,

80
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:20,710
stepped in to help.

81
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:22,670
With just a gentle lift of his hand,

82
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,800
he raised the ship.

83
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,990
It landed steadily on the ground.

84
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,430
Not a single person died.

85
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:30,790
He lifted that huge ship

86
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,990
with just one hand?

87
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:33,710
That's what makes him

88
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:35,230
an immortal, doesn't it?

89
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,909
Miss, your water.

90
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,390
May I ask how to get to

91
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:42,150
Bailiping?

92
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,030
Follow this road

93
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,230
straight ahead.

94
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,790
You'll get there in two days.

95
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:46,750
Thank you.

96
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:47,710
If it weren't for that immortal,

97
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:49,750
many families would've died.

98
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:51,270
That's right.

99
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,550
Immortals are certainly powerful,

100
00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:54,230
but the human craftsmanship

101
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:55,430
isn't so bad either.

102
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,240
[Destiny Tavern]

103
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,590
Sir, we're out of wine.

104
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,590
Two more jugs of wine, please.

105
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,510
Got it. They'll be served soon.

106
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:18,070
It's been raining for two days.

107
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:19,750
When will it stop?

108
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:21,790
I wish I knew.

109
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:23,510
Of all places to get stuck,

110
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,030
we're stuck in the middle of nowhere

111
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:26,020
on a remote mountain.

112
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:27,550
Just my luck.

113
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:30,230
Miss, it's damp on rainy days.

114
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:31,710
Have some hot soup to warm your stomach.

115
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:32,950
Thank you.

116
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,670
Soup's ready.

117
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:54,860
Drink it while it's hot.

118
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,030
Thank you.

119
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,840
What is this?

120
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:02,470
The Juque Sword.

121
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,230
It's said to be the fifth sword

122
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,630
forged by the Sword God, Ouye Zi.

123
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,750
It can pierce copper and cut iron,

124
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,270
unmatched in sharpness,

125
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,830
able to slice through any divine weapon.

126
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:19,750
I set out this time

127
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:21,200
just to find it.

128
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:22,910
Why do you want to find it?

129
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,620
Regardless of the reason,

130
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,870
since you want to find it,

131
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,430
I'll definitely find it for you.

132
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:45,510
Miss, traveling alone

133
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,110
must be boring.

134
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:49,590
Why don't you join us for a drink?

135
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,200
Don't be so cold.

136
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:59,230
Get lost.

137
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,270
Go, go.

138
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:56,120
Sir, I'd like a premium room.

139
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,150
Sure. This way, please.

140
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:01,830
Please, this way.

141
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:16,790
The rain just stopped. I'll brew some tea.

142
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:17,900
Have some before you leave

143
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:18,750
to warm yourselves up.

144
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:21,390
You sure packed well for this trip.

145
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:23,470
Gotta be prepared when you're out traveling.

146
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:38,550
Stop!

147
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,630
Tea's ready.

148
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,530
Thanks.

149
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,150
It smells wonderful.

150
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,710
Where are we headed now?

151
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:00,720
We're going to find Kai Shan.

152
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,110
Who's Kai Shan?

153
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,270
My brother.

154
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,630
We're all Yuanzhong's weapon spirits.

155
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,390
The Divine Left Hand has two weapon spirits?

156
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,270
Not just two. There are five in total.

157
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:11,790
Impressive, isn't it?

158
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:16,550
Yuanzhong, this tea is quite good.

159
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,310
Try some.

160
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,670
-Ji Tanyin…
-That day on the ship,

161
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,630
you used the power of the Divine Hand to hold it up.

162
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:36,710
It must have exhausted you.

163
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,910
Are you feeling alright?

164
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,030
I'm fine.

165
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:44,910
That's good.

166
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:48,150
But you've only just broken the seal.

167
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,120
Your body hasn't fully recovered yet.

168
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,830
You need to be careful.

169
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:59,190
Oh, right.

170
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:00,550
I saw

171
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:02,150
Mr. Tanghua on the ship.

172
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,910
We left that day

173
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,550
without letting him know.

174
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,350
Was that okay?

175
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,870
I didn't let you know either,

176
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,510
but you still followed me.

177
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:14,390
Let's put the past behind us.

178
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,110
I'm not upset anymore.

179
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:18,030
So stop avoiding me, okay?

180
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:20,710
If I say no, will you leave?

181
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:21,430
No.

182
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,030
Then why bother asking me?

183
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:30,150
For a divine artifact to create a weapon spirit,

184
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:31,550
it requires an incredible stroke of luck.

185
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:33,230
I thought the Divine Left Hand

186
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,830
only had one weapon spirit—Zi Fei.

187
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:36,630
I never expected there to be five.

188
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,260
It's truly astonishing.

189
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:42,600
You seem to know a lot about this.

190
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,070
Well,

191
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:47,110
I just know a little about it.

192
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:56,310
Back then, the Council of Elders

193
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:57,310
bound me with the golden hoop,

194
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:58,990
and my weapon spirits

195
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:00,310
were imprisoned as well.

196
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,420
Aside from Zi Fei, the other four

197
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,590
were each sealed

198
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:04,670
in different places.

199
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,190
Now that I've escaped,

200
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,270
I naturally want to set them free.

201
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:10,870
Then I'll go with you.

202
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:15,910
You've made up your mind

203
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:16,950
to follow me?

204
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,120
Don't worry.

205
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,910
I'd never harm you.

206
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,710
So stop avoiding me, okay?

207
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:23,910
Don't push me away again.

208
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,830
Then do something for me.

209
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:31,230
100 miles east,

210
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:32,270
there's a place called Shifang Town.

211
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:33,590
In that town, there's an alley called Penglai Alley.

212
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:34,070
Go there

213
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,500
and find a family with the surname Bai.

214
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:36,430
Give this letter

215
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:37,510
to the head of that household.

216
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:38,600
Tell him I'm here

217
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,900
and bring him to see me.

218
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,020
Well...

219
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,390
Can't you send Zi Fei instead?

220
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,630
You have the mechanical bird. You're faster.

221
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:52,350
It won't take long for you to come back.

222
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:58,230
What's wrong? You don't want to go?

223
00:14:58,350 --> 00:14:59,470
It's not that.

224
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:01,670
Since you want to follow me,

225
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:03,190
you have to do something for me.

226
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:05,310
I don't keep idle people around.

227
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:11,500
Fine. Forget it.

228
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,430
Alright, alright.

229
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:13,390
I'll go.

230
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:15,270
But promise me

231
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:16,440
that you won't wander around.

232
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,470
You must wait for me here.

233
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:18,750
Don't leave without me.

234
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,470
I'll be back

235
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:20,630
very soon.

236
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,350
Off you go.

237
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:23,230
Wait for me here.

238
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,950
The mountains to the east stretch endlessly.

239
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:30,590
There's no such place

240
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:31,790
as Shifang Town or Penglai Alley.

241
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:32,790
You lied to her again.

242
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,270
It's useless, Yuanzhong.

243
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:36,670
Her tracking skills are exceptional.

244
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:37,550
If she finds out you tricked her,

245
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:38,790
she'll catch up soon.

246
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:53,230
He lied to me again.

247
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:59,660
Come on, friends!

248
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:00,630
Have you ever complained

249
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:01,750
about the unfairness of this world?

250
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,620
Have you ever felt your talents go unrecognized?

251
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,910
No worries, look over here!

252
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:05,950
Come to me!

253
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:06,590
With one tael of silver,

254
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,790
you can make your dream come true.

255
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:08,430
With ten taels of silver,

256
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:09,780
you can win a future for yourself.

257
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:10,590
Remember,

258
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:13,110
fortune never abandons the lucky ones.

259
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:15,960
Come on, limited spots available! Place your bets now!

260
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,150
Come on, place your bets!

261
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:19,480
Place your bets. Life or death.

262
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:20,780
Come on!

263
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,270
Miss, what would you like to order?

264
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,230
A helping of meat buns.

265
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,750
Alright, please wait a moment.

266
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:28,430
Excuse me.

267
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:30,750
Is there anything else you need?

268
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:31,830
I want to know...

269
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:32,550
Is this mountain

270
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:33,950
Yingong Mountain?

271
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:35,230
Yingong Mountain?

272
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:36,950
This is Baitou Mountain.

273
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,080
Baitou Mountain?

274
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:38,870
Yeah.

275
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:40,830
Baitou Mountain

276
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:42,110
is quite famous.

277
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:43,950
There's a reclusive immortal living up there,

278
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:45,750
known as Lord Mei Shan.

279
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,460
People also call him Old Ghost Mei Shan.

280
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,440
Immortals are hard to find elsewhere,

281
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:50,990
but if you come to Baitou Mountain,

282
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:51,910
seeing one is not

283
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:52,710
difficult at all.

284
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:53,630
Every now and then,

285
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:54,150
you might even get to

286
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,590
witness him facing his tribulations.

287
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:01,840
Come on!

288
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,390
A wild boar can't stomach fine bran.

289
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,950
You can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.

290
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,869
When it's time to be greedy, be greedy.

291
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,880
Will he survive it or not? Place your bets!

292
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:09,950
My dear friends,

293
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:10,790
just go all in!

294
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,069
What are they doing?

295
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:13,190
Well,

296
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:14,349
they're betting on whether Old Ghost Mei Shan

297
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:16,109
will attain ascension this time

298
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:17,550
or get struck dead

299
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:18,750
by the heavenly lightning.

300
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:19,630
Place your bets!

301
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:25,910
Could you slow down a bit?

302
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,430
No matter where we go,

303
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:34,870
she always manages to catch up.

304
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:36,110
She may show up soon.

305
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,630
What should we do then?

306
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:38,590
Stop her.

307
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,830
Who's going to stop her?

308
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:40,590
You, of course.

309
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:41,270
Me?

310
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,590
She's come back from death twice.

311
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:44,310
Even death can't stop her.

312
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,060
How can I?

313
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,230
Figure it out yourself.

314
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,950
Anyway, no matter what,

315
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:50,630
don't let me see her again.

316
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:58,310
Old Ghost Mei Shan

317
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,430
is really something.

318
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:01,670
Legend has it that years ago,

319
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:02,940
he had already broken through his limits

320
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,790
and should have ascended to godhood.

321
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,390
But luck wasn't on his side.

322
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:08,350
After the war between gods and demons, all gods vanished,

323
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:10,190
the Gate of Heaven stayed closed, and the Divine Realm never appeared.

324
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,670
So despite all his abilities,

325
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:12,750
he couldn't ascend

326
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:13,910
and had to stay in the mortal world.

327
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:15,270
All these years,

328
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,870
he's been undergoing tribulations again and again?

329
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:20,110
That's why we call him unlucky.

330
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:22,190
Every 49 days,

331
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:23,310
Old Ghost Mei Shan

332
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,990
has to face a tribulation—

333
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,350
wind tribulation, fire tribulation, lightning tribulation…

334
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:29,470
It's been quite a spectacle for us.

335
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:32,030
He survives one tribulation only to face another,

336
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:32,870
and each one

337
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:34,630
is stronger than the last.

338
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,150
Everyone's curious to see

339
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:38,270
how long he can hold out.

340
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:40,150
Isn't there also a love tribulation?

341
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,400
Immortal Mei Shan's love for Xin Mei

342
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:43,630
has brought him

343
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:44,870
endless suffering.

344
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,950
This Old Ghost Mei Shan you're talking about...

345
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:50,990
Is he a friend

346
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:52,500
of the Youhu Clan's High Priest?

347
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:53,430
Friend?

348
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:56,480
More like a sworn enemy.

349
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,680
During the battle of Pinghu,

350
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:01,070
the High Priest, while trying to kill the War Demons,

351
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:03,230
accidentally sank Pinghu Xianzhou

352
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:04,110
into the sea.

353
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:05,630
And Pinghu Xianzhou

354
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:07,270
happened to be

355
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,470
Immortal Mei Shan's dwelling.

356
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:24,870
And then?

357
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,710
After that,

358
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,790
Old Ghost Mei Shan

359
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:29,510
moved to Baitou Mountain

360
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:32,100
and never left it.

361
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,550
60 years without leaving the mountain?

362
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:36,590
Exactly.

363
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:37,790
Who knows?

364
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,190
Maybe the High Priest scared him

365
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,230
out of his wits.

366
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:46,030
Where is my head?

367
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,280
Has anyone seen my head?

368
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:56,110
There are so many heads here.

369
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:59,930
Which one is mine?

370
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:06,390
Lend me your head,

371
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:08,270
will you?

372
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:12,670
How dare you grab my neck!

373
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,310
Bastard, do you have a death wish?

374
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:15,720
I haven't seen you in 60 years.

375
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:17,430
Your mouth is still as foul as ever.

376
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:18,950
Yuanzhong?

377
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:22,030
Perfect timing. Come up the mountain now.

378
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:54,870
Mei Shan.

379
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:56,710
Where the hell are you?

380
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,110
Yuanzhong.

381
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,130
I'm here.

382
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:03,150
I'm not dead yet,

383
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:05,150
but I'm getting close.

384
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:12,190
It's over.

385
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:13,790
It's all over.

386
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:15,670
What am I supposed to do?

387
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,830
Trouble always picks on the unlucky,

388
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:18,990
and misfortune only befalls

389
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,430
miserable guys like me.

390
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,180
Yuanzhong, help me!

391
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,360
[Mei Shan, sword cultivator, human race]

392
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:27,550
So the rumors are true?

393
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:30,590
What nonsense

394
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:31,710
have they been spreading about me now?

395
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:32,510
They say you made it through

396
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:33,670
your tribulation years ago

397
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:35,150
but failed to ascend to godhood,

398
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:36,880
and you've been suffering from tribulations ever since.

399
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:42,580
Well, they're not wrong.

400
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:43,830
As you know,

401
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:44,800
all gods vanished,

402
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,680
the Gate of Heaven won't open,

403
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,680
and there's no one to guide the way.

404
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,110
How am I supposed to become a god?

405
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:48,950
Yuanzhong,

406
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:50,510
show me a way out

407
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:51,910
and save this miserable soul.

408
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:52,510
If you can't help me,

409
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:53,550
just kill me and put me

410
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,350
out of my misery

411
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:56,030
so I won't have to live in constant fear.

412
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,830
You've survived so many tribulations.

413
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,350
So you should be experienced

414
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,500
and well-prepared by now.

415
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:03,630
What are you afraid of?

416
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:06,950
This isn't

417
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,510
about preparation.

418
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,030
Those damn tribulations

419
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,350
get stronger every time.

420
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,550
One stab is bad enough.

421
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:15,350
The second stab won't hurt any less.

422
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:16,710
Get stabbed a few more times,

423
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:17,920
and you're dead.

424
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,880
If you keep talking like that,

425
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:25,200
I might as well head back.

426
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:27,670
Before coming down here, I checked the sky.

427
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:29,550
A lot of thunderclouds had gathered.

428
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,230
Given the amount of them, even I

429
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:32,190
couldn't emerge unscathed.

430
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:33,950
Aside from wishing you good luck,

431
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,670
all I can offer is to clean up your remains afterward.

432
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:40,510
Yuanzhong,

433
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:42,590
this is a life-or-death situation.

434
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:43,990
If you leave now,

435
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:44,740
the next time you see me

436
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,550
will be at my grave.

437
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:51,350
Cut to the chase.

438
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:53,750
It's all the fault

439
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:55,670
of that drunkard Zhuo Fangsheng.

440
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:57,110
He came by a while ago

441
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:59,230
with two jars of Breath Suppressing Wine.

442
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:00,150
He said drinking it

443
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:01,350
could suppress my breath for a while

444
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:02,350
so I could escape the tribulation.

445
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:05,150
That drunkard's character is questionable,

446
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:06,630
but his wine is good.

447
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,790
Didn't it work?

448
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:09,580
It worked.

449
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:10,900
After I finished two jars of it,

450
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:11,950
I passed out for half a year.

451
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:14,710
But it only worked temporarily.

452
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:15,470
I just sobered up,

453
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,630
and the tribulation is coming again.

454
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:17,270
Looks like

455
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,230
all the tribulations

456
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,200
I escaped during those six months

457
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,870
are coming all at once this time.

458
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:27,590
Yuanzhong,

459
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:29,550
this frail body of mine

460
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:30,990
can't take it.

461
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,190
Wait a minute. How did you get out?

462
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,590
Back then, you were sealed in Fangwai Mountain.

463
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:38,310
I wanted to rescue you,

464
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:39,510
but you flat-out refused.

465
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,310
I came here to look for Kai Shan.

466
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,080
You've broken free of the golden hoop?

467
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:50,070
My savior,

468
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:52,060
I'm counting on you

469
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,870
to save my life.

470
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,190
This lightning tribulation is not an ordinary one.

471
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,160
Even I

472
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,950
might not be able to take it all for you.

473
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:00,390
That's good enough.

474
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:01,390
Back then, when you fought me,

475
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:03,190
you only used 20 percent of your power.

476
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:05,670
That overwhelming power

477
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:08,030
fully displayed your majestic demeanor.

478
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:09,950
I've never forgotten it.

479
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:10,780
Here's the plan:

480
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:11,990
when I take the lightning later,

481
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:13,310
you'll protect me.

482
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:14,110
Before the lightning strikes,

483
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,030
you must disperse

484
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:16,030
the thunderclouds.

485
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,470
Otherwise, lightning will keep coming,

486
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:18,720
and it'll only get stronger.

487
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:33,710
Stop right there!

488
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:36,790
I knew you'd come.

489
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:38,190
Yuanzhong doesn't allow you to go up the mountain.

490
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,670
What is he doing here?

491
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:41,580
Didn't he say he was going to find Kai Shan?

492
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:44,240
I just don't understand.

493
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,870
Why do you have to ditch me?

494
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:46,630
Then why are you

495
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:47,870
so determined to follow us?

496
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:49,190
Ji Tanyin,

497
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:50,470
it's not like you're an assassin

498
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:51,310
sent by the human race

499
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:52,470
or the War Demons.

500
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:53,750
You don't want Yuanzhong's life.

501
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,270
So why are you doing this?

502
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:58,590
Could it be that you've fallen for him?

503
00:24:59,150 --> 00:24:59,870
Let me tell you,

504
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:01,550
Yuanzhong is petty

505
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:02,430
and selfish.

506
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:03,910
He's not a good match for you.

507
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:05,670
You're good-looking and skilled in craftsmanship.

508
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,270
The world's full of better options,

509
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:08,390
so stop wasting your time

510
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:10,470
on a man like him.

511
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:16,750
What are you looking for?

512
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:20,230
Hey, listen to me.

513
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,160
You'd better leave on your own.

514
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,630
But if you refuse to go,

515
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:24,670
I've come up with

516
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:25,790
a compromise for you.

517
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:26,990
Do you want to hear it?

518
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:28,270
What compromise?

519
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:29,830
Since you're so determined to follow us,

520
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:31,670
why not stay three miles away

521
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:32,670
and tail us from a distance?

522
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:34,390
We won't meet or get in each other's way.

523
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:35,980
Everyone's happy. How about that?

524
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,670
What are you doing?

525
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:43,830
Let's talk this out.

526
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:44,550
I'm not gentle

527
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:45,710
when I fight.

528
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:46,990
I don't want to hurt you

529
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:48,110
by accident.

530
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,150
What is that?

531
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:54,790
The Void Crossbow.

532
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:55,730
Eyes can

533
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,150
see things

534
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:58,510
because of light.

535
00:25:58,510 --> 00:25:59,870
When light hits an object

536
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:00,910
and reflects back into the eyes,

537
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:01,870
the brain forms

538
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:03,790
an image of that object.

539
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:05,230
So,

540
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:07,310
if all the light is absorbed,

541
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:08,590
you won't be able to see me.

542
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:13,540
Sounds impressive,

543
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,460
though I didn't quite follow.

544
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,710
So you're going to shoot me with that arrow

545
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,230
to make me blind, right?

546
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:23,020
I'm not going to use the Void Crossbow to shoot you.

547
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,390
Don't give me that.

548
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,000
I don't buy it.

549
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:34,020
Where is she?

550
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:47,870
Not letting me ascend is one thing,

551
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:49,440
but trying to strike me dead?

552
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:50,590
You think you can do that?

553
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,990
I've given you so many chances all these years,

554
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:54,500
but you never seized them.

555
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:56,070
Now that my best buddy is here,

556
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:57,430
you've got even less of a chance!

557
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:02,070
I…

558
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:03,640
I'm not backing down!

559
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:05,050
Come on, hit me again!

560
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,470
Don't chicken out like a coward!

561
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:07,870
Stop provoking it, will you?

562
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:10,110
Fate has backed me into a corner.

563
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,170
If I still showed it respect after all this,

564
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,300
wouldn't that make me an idiot?

565
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:19,550
I'm coming!

566
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,290
Yuanzhong, take it down.

567
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:43,470
Run!

568
00:27:57,930 --> 00:28:00,300
♫Time never defeats the fleeting world♫

569
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:04,030
♫Stars turn, shining upon the passing traveler♫

570
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:08,050
♫The wind rises, flowers fall and bloom again♫

571
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:11,080
♫Awaiting what's lost to be regained♫

572
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:15,000
♫These countless sorrows and joys♫

573
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:19,530
♫Dusk and dawn, only you make parting hard♫

574
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:25,730
♫I'm willing to risk my life for this♫

575
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:30,050
♫If our promise♫

576
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:33,570
♫Is to share this land and rivers♫

577
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:37,210
♫If fate leads us astray♫

578
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:41,310
♫Life and death become our bond♫

579
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:44,550
♫Storms heal with time♫

580
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:48,670
♫Memories will shine in the end♫

581
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:54,440
♫That very first heartbeat, I will remember until the last♫

582
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:59,070
This girl was so good to you.

583
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,700
Was she your friend?

584
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:05,990
Yuanzhong said she was sent by War Demons

585
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:07,350
to assassinate him.

586
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,730
You call this an assassin?

587
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:11,390
If you run into

588
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:12,950
another "assassin" like her,

589
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,630
could you introduce us?

590
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:15,630
I'll take her home,

591
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:16,590
treat her like a queen,

592
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:17,580
and give her everything she wants.

593
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,030
We don't understand her either.

594
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:20,950
Come to think of it,

595
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:21,790
this is the second time

596
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:23,150
she's taken a hit for Yuanzhong.

597
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:29,390
Alright.

598
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,450
Whoever she was,

599
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:34,270
she's gone now.

600
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:36,630
Let's lay her to rest.

601
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:39,180
She's dead.

602
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:40,700
She's not an ordinary girl.

603
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,350
She came back from death several times.

604
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,630
Yuanzhong used the power of the Divine Hand

605
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:45,390
to seal her in an icy lake,

606
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:47,680
yet not long after, she revived.

607
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:50,550
But this time is different.

608
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:53,010
That lightning tribulation had been building up for half a year.

609
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:55,310
Even Yuanzhong didn't dare take it head-on.

610
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:56,190
No matter how strong she was,

611
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:57,510
she was still just a human.

612
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:58,750
How could she survive that?

613
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:03,080
I don't know why she managed

614
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:04,910
to come back from death again and again,

615
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,750
but speaking from my own experience with tribulations,

616
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:08,950
this time, she's done for.

617
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:10,660
Even if

618
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:12,110
it were an ancestor

619
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,790
of the War Demons,

620
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:15,310
they still couldn't survive that lightning strike.

621
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,710
Why am I back again?

622
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:37,810
How am I supposed to know?

623
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:39,070
You tell me.

624
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,870
You were summoned back by the Ascension Platform,

625
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:42,150
and your primordial spirit was severely injured.

626
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:44,310
If Hannv hadn't saved you,

627
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,510
you might not have made it

628
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,950
this time.

629
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:49,030
Why was your primordial spirit

630
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:50,220
so badly injured?

631
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:54,700
It seems that

632
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:56,870
I took a tribulation

633
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:59,190
for Yuanzhong at Baitou Mountain.

634
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:00,590
He's about to become a god?

635
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:03,380
It was a friend of his.

636
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:06,030
Yuanzhong tried to help him ascend

637
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:07,390
using the Divine Hand, but it backfired,

638
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:09,150
and the tribulation targeted him instead.

639
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:11,070
I jumped in to save him,

640
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:13,430
and the lightning struck me.

641
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:15,190
You were so reckless.

642
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,510
That was a tribulation—

643
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,270
a test of the heavenly way to determine whether a soul

644
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:20,670
is worthy of godhood.

645
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,270
Interfering with that

646
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:24,510
is going against the laws of heaven.

647
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:26,630
No wonder your primordial spirit was injured.

648
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:30,810
Hannv,

649
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,080
why is it that someone

650
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:35,440
can't ascend to godhood

651
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,370
yet keep facing tribulations?

652
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,280
During the war between gods and demons,

653
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:40,470
the celestial ladder was destroyed.

654
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:41,380
Since then, no one from the mortal realm

655
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,830
has been able to ascend to godhood.

656
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:44,670
But if

657
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:46,160
someone's cultivation

658
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,750
reaches the level required for ascension,

659
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:50,390
the laws of heaven will sense it

660
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:51,550
and give them a tribulation.

661
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:56,030
Back when I faced my tribulation,

662
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:59,940
I barely survived it.

663
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:01,950
Even now,

664
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:03,790
I still often dream about

665
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:05,910
scenes from that tribulation.

666
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:09,920
That guy's impressive.

667
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:11,750
After enduring so many tribulations,

668
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:13,440
he's actually still alive.

669
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,990
Wasn't the Youhu Clan's High Priest

670
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:18,590
sealed in Fangwai Mountain?

671
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:20,480
How did he end up in Baitou Mountain?

672
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:22,990
The Divine Left Hand

673
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:24,910
created five weapon spirits in total.

674
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:26,550
Aside from the one

675
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:28,150
who's always by his side,

676
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:29,870
the other four

677
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:30,990
were sealed away back then

678
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,390
just like he was.

679
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:34,070
Now that

680
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:36,050
he's broken free,

681
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:38,110
he's naturally set out to rescue

682
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:39,630
the other four weapon spirits.

683
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,110
And Baitou Mountain

684
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:42,870
is one of the stops.

685
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,470
Five weapon spirits?

686
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:46,150
That's incredible fortune.

687
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:51,950
Your primordial spirit is severely damaged.

688
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:53,270
It's not a minor injury.

689
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:55,110
You won't be able to return for a while.

690
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,470
Just stay in the Heavenly Realm and focus on your recovery.

691
00:34:20,469 --> 00:34:21,280
Tanyin.

692
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:23,670
Tanyin.

693
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:33,310
Deity Taihe?

694
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:39,030
Tanyin.

695
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:42,460
Come here.

696
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:58,300
Yuanzhong…

697
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:02,440
We need to meet soon.

698
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:36,710
Tanyin.

699
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:40,670
Why are you here?

700
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:43,070
Didn't I tell you to get enough rest?

701
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:45,540
Your injuries are serious.

702
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:47,030
You have to take them seriously.

703
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:48,910
I know. I just...

704
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:55,550
Nothing.

705
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:59,070
Luofu Sea is a place of extreme yin in the Heavenly Realm.

706
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,110
Don't linger here for long.

707
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:01,510
Go back

708
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,270
before it harms your primordial spirit.

709
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:04,870
You know it's a place of extreme yin,

710
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:06,390
yet you still come here every day.

711
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:08,230
I'm older

712
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:09,470
and more powerful than you.

713
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:11,550
Besides, your physical body is still in the mortal realm,

714
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:12,910
and you've got responsibilities to carry.

715
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,300
I'm not like you.

716
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:16,110
I have nothing else to do

717
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:17,830
but stay here.

718
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:21,350
Do you remember

719
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:22,430
what you promised me

720
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:23,550
before you left last time?

721
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:26,310
I promised that

722
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:28,550
I wouldn't force you to kill him and take his hand for now.

723
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:30,150
But you also promised me

724
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,740
you wouldn't interfere with his fate

725
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:33,430
or shield him from harm,

726
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:34,250
didn't you?

727
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:37,590
So what do you have to say this time?

728
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,310
Everything happened too fast.

729
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:41,150
At that time,

730
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:43,070
I didn't even have time to think.

731
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:45,190
Then I'll forgive you one more time.

732
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:47,350
But if it happens again,

733
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:48,910
I won't just let it slide.

734
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:50,830
You may find it laughable,

735
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:52,590
but I hold both respect and love

736
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,590
for Deity Taihe.

737
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:57,110
Even though he's the Primordial God

738
00:36:57,130 --> 00:36:58,610
who follows the path of detachment

739
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:00,390
and is free from desire and attachments,

740
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:02,030
my feelings for him

741
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,640
have never changed.

742
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:06,870
I can allow you

743
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:08,710
to spare that guy's life for now.

744
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:10,630
But if you keep protecting him

745
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:11,670
from death,

746
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:14,410
then you'll be my enemy.

747
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:23,750
We've been friends for thousands of years.

748
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:25,390
Don't let this matter

749
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:26,710
drive us apart.

750
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:28,230
Hannv…

751
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:29,470
Alright. Enough.

752
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:31,750
Go back to your palace.

753
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:40,790
Has she always been like this?

754
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:41,830
Yes.

755
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:43,670
The witch doctor said that with her injuries,

756
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:45,020
she should have died long ago.

757
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:46,590
But there's some kind of power

758
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:47,550
keeping her alive.

759
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:51,220
I guess it's the power of a god.

760
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:53,910
A god?

761
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:55,270
Chief,

762
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,830
Ming Zhang sent word

763
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:58,310
that Qian Lin

764
00:37:58,430 --> 00:37:59,910
once boarded a human tower ship

765
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:00,590
and ran into

766
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:01,870
the Youhu Clan's High Priest.

767
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:03,310
That kid attacked him recklessly,

768
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:05,280
got seriously injured, and escaped.

769
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:07,480
It's unknown whether he's still alive.

770
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,590
The God-Slaying Dagger has also gone missing.

771
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:11,710
Send people out.

772
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:13,620
No matter the cost,

773
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:14,780
find him.

774
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,750
Yes.

775
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:17,510
Ming Zhang has gone to Yandu

776
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:18,430
to track down those people.

777
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:19,150
I believe

778
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:20,470
he'll send word back soon.

779
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:31,390
How's he doing? Still in there?

780
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:33,150
He never left.

781
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:36,190
He just lost a handmaiden,

782
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:36,870
yet he's acting like

783
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:38,030
his wife died.

784
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:39,750
Don't say that.

785
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:41,580
Ji Tanyin was really nice.

786
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,510
Maybe she's not really gone.

787
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:45,070
She might come back to life again.

788
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:47,950
"Come back to life again."

789
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:48,780
Are you dreaming?

790
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:49,590
She's gone for good.

791
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:50,150
If she woke up,

792
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:50,700
I'd let you

793
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:51,790
sit on my head.

794
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:22,440
What a heartbreaking sight.

795
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,900
I feel like crying.

796
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:25,790
Yuanzhong.

797
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:29,590
You like her, don't you?

798
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:31,390
Don't be shy.

799
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:33,110
Feelings

800
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:34,790
are just tricky like this.

801
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:37,590
You don't realize what they mean

802
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:41,070
until the person's gone and leaves you full of regrets.

803
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:43,630
I've been there.

804
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:44,400
Back when I…

805
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:47,190
Yuanzhong!

806
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:48,870
Listen,

807
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:50,470
she's been lying dead for so many days.

808
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:52,230
Before she wakes up, she'll rot first!

809
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:26,110
What are you doing?

810
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:29,870
Are you… trying to take advantage of me?

811
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:30,690
I...

812
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:32,730
I... I'll go get someone.

813
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:37,390
Mei Shan.

814
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:38,860
She's awake, she's awake!

815
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:41,020
Who's awake? Ji Tanyin is awake?

816
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:43,870
Unbelievable.

817
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,630
Do I need to...

818
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:54,750
Well, um...

819
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:57,910
Didn't you say she woke up?

820
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:02,390
She really did just now.

821
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:05,990
Are you sure?

822
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:19,870
How is she?

823
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,270
Tell me, how is she?

824
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:29,230
Give me your hand.

825
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:30,680
What for?

826
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:31,500
Give me your hand.

827
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:37,590
I'm not asking about myself.

828
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:38,910
I'm asking how she is.

829
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:39,750
Her?

830
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:40,870
She's been dead for several days.

831
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:42,150
What do you expect?

832
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,030
But she just talked to me.

833
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:45,540
She talked to you just now?

834
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:50,110
Yuanzhong.

835
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:53,200
Maybe you're overwhelmed with grief

836
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:54,630
and had hallucinations.

837
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:55,910
It's understandable.

838
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:58,960
This is too much for you.

839
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:05,150
Hallucinations?

840
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:24,350
Are you about to leave,

841
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:26,190
or did you just come back?

842
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:30,020
I was about to leave,

843
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:31,350
but there's something

844
00:42:31,350 --> 00:42:31,990
I think I should

845
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:33,350
let you know first.

846
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:34,390
What is it?

847
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:36,550
Earlier, I had a dream

848
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:38,210
about Deity Taihe

849
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:39,990
and Yuanzhong.

850
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:42,470
A dream?

851
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,030
Something felt off about both of them.

852
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:46,150
In that dream,

853
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:47,800
I seemed to be very afraid of them,

854
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:49,590
like I didn't know them at all.

855
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:50,790
Tell me

856
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:52,150
what you saw in that dream.
