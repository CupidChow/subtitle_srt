[A Moment But Forever]

2
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,220
[Episode 25]

3
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,200
Can you represent fairness and justice?

4
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,200
I cannot.

5
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:54,640
But the Six Realms have their own laws and regulations.

6
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,870
Both the human race and the immortal race

7
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:59,000
have their own laws and rules.

8
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,350
If someone goes against them,

9
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:03,730
disregarding all life, insisting on turning to the demonic path,

10
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,230
and bringing great harm to the world's harmony,

11
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,520
then heaven's laws will definitely deal with them.

12
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:11,080
Even if that person has many reasons,

13
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,280
they still must pay the price

14
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,360
for their actions.

15
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,750
Here's your dish, sir.

16
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,470
It tastes good.

17
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,590
Try it.

18
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,120
Bravo! Bravo!

19
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,960
Where are we?

20
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,570
Up ahead is the Years Well.

21
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,360
An old man once told me that

22
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,380
[Years Well]

23
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,240
during the Lantern Festival in Yandu,

24
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,270
many young people come here.

25
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,840
If you pray with sincerity,

26
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,240
you'll catch a glimpse of your future.

27
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:12,800
I didn't know that Yandu

28
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,730
had such a place.

29
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,230
Let's go and take a look too.

30
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:22,840
Before praying,

31
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,630
put these three kinds of leaves

32
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,060
into a red cloth strip

33
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,280
and hang it by the well.

34
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:31,240
Legend has it this brings good luck.

35
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:36,240
Locust leaf, elm leaf, and willow leaf?

36
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,630
Yes.

37
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,710
The word "locust" sounds like "first."

38
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,680
People always hope that their children

39
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:44,400
pass the imperial exams

40
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,710
and become officials in the court.

41
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,310
In March, people have fresh elm seeds

42
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,000
steamed with sugar

43
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,800
and call it "elm seed cakes."

44
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:55,079
Elm trees symbolize favorable weather for crops

45
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:56,490
and food for the people.

46
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,280
And the word "willow" sounds like "stay,"

47
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:04,910
carrying the meaning that those in love will not be separated.

48
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,590
It is indeed a good omen.

49
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:11,530
What did you see?

50
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:12,820
Nothing.

51
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,230
Maybe I wasn't sincere enough,

52
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,800
so I didn't see anything.

53
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,380
What about you?

54
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,210
What did you see?

55
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,480
I...

56
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,510
I saw your future—

57
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,240
your good days

58
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:50,750
50, 80,

59
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,480
or even two or three hundred years from now.

60
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,920
By then,

61
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,230
you will have white hair but a youthful face,

62
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:00,110
surrounded by your children and grandchildren.

63
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,310
You will be full of kindness and ease,

64
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,080
joy and peace.

65
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:07,920
You will grow old together with one person.

66
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,310
And many others will envy you.

67
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,480
That's all?

68
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:14,630
In the end,

69
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,060
you will find fulfillment

70
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,390
and live a life that, when you look back on it,

71
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:22,190
is filled with endless happiness.

72
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,260
But with whom will I

73
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,750
spend a fulfilling life?

74
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:41,190
The rich fragrance fills the heaven and earth.

75
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,500
This scent reaches the Gate of Heaven.

76
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,900
Crossing a thousand miles, we offer incense in prayer,

77
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:49,000
hoping for the true god to appear at this altar.

78
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,070
Oh god,

79
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,540
I am your most faithful servant.

80
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,800
I have an important matter to report to you.

81
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:58,830
I have an important matter to report to you!

82
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,970
You are truly useless.

83
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:37,210
Goddess, please forgive us.

84
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:38,770
It was all my fault.

85
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,510
Goddess, please help me

86
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:42,770
and give me another chance.

87
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,480
Haven't I given you enough chances?

88
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,510
Give me one last chance.

89
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,360
Either Yuanzhong dies,

90
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,670
or,

91
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,910
I die.

92
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,150
If you War Demons

93
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:32,200
want to become perfect War Demons,

94
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,030
you must understand

95
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,720
the true meaning of life and death

96
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,870
through countless fierce battles.

97
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,600
Break down and then rebuild;

98
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:41,120
accumulate thoroughly, then release gradually.

99
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,870
Only then can you be reborn from the fire

100
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:45,180
and awaken the power in your bloodline.

101
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,660
This combat power is no different from divine power.

102
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,030
And it was the very foundation upon which

103
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:51,560
your ancestors once stood in the Divine Realm.

104
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,790
My concerns for my clan

105
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,020
have led to many distractions,

106
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,200
preventing me from comprehending

107
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,440
the final level.

108
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:00,960
This Picture of Hundred Ghosts

109
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,480
can help you

110
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,020
quickly achieve perfection.

111
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,020
While it's not as powerful

112
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,960
as a truly perfect War Demon,

113
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,790
there are enough of you,

114
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,670
so that should be enough to deal with him.

115
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,950
That's it?

116
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,240
No.

117
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:16,870
You still need to open the gate

118
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,570
of the Picture of Hundred Ghosts.

119
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:55,390
Follow me.

120
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,550
Bring in the corpse of Granny Gu.

121
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:42,400
You came here late at night.

122
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:43,730
For what?

123
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,120
You haven't answered the question

124
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,260
I asked you today.

125
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,440
Haven't you already seen

126
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,510
my future?

127
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,990
Why are you still asking me?

128
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,150
When we were at Gushan,

129
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:51,910
I didn't enter

130
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:53,270
your ninth layer of dreams.

131
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,150
What exactly is in there?

132
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,200
You want to know,

133
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,960
so I have to tell you?

134
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,960
If you don't tell me,

135
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,400
I'll just have to see it for myself.

136
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:15,010
Why is it different here from before?

137
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,720
You're really ridiculous.

138
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,150
I just wanted to confirm something.

139
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,960
Are you trying to confirm whether I'm a good person?

140
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,120
Or whether I can live out my days

141
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,790
as a kind old man?

142
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,340
What if I'm not?

143
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,900
Are you going to kill me?

144
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:37,240
Don't say that.

145
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,000
Don't?

146
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,360
It's because you haven't seen

147
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,630
a reason to act yet, right?

148
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:41,840
I believe what I see

149
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,840
with my own eyes.

150
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,550
So,

151
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,890
please let me take a look.

152
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,270
What if I don't?

153
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:48,440
That means

154
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,750
you're hiding something from me.

155
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,710
Hiding something from you?

156
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,900
How ridiculous, Ji Tanyin.

157
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,240
Don't you have anything you're hiding from me?

158
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,840
I've already felt the presence

159
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,080
of that dragon.

160
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:01,790
So today,

161
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:02,720
I must enter your

162
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,160
ninth layer of dreams to take a look.

163
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:05,670
That's not up to you.

164
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:15,040
At the Years Well,

165
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:16,870
you said I would

166
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,550
grow old with one person.

167
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:20,790
Who is that?

168
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,580
Who am I going to

169
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:26,200
have many children and grandchildren with?

170
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:29,320
I've told you before, Yuanzhong.

171
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,480
Told me what?

172
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,720
Your third rule?

173
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:32,650
Absolutely not

174
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,690
to fall in love with you?

175
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,870
I have my reasons.

176
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,840
Then tell me your reasons!

177
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:45,840
Ji Tanyin,

178
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,360
you told me to live a carefree life.

179
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,120
Let me ask you.

180
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,020
♫Time never defeats the fleeting world♫

181
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:55,760
I'll ask you one last time.

182
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:00,690
♫Stars turn, shining upon the passing traveler♫

183
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,420
Where do you want me to go?

184
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,640
What kind of life do you want me to live?

185
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:03,910
♫The wind rises, flowers fall and bloom again♫

186
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:04,570
And who do you want me to spend it with?

187
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,950
♫Awaiting what's lost to be regained♫

188
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,530
This is the last time I'm asking you.

189
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,780
♫These countless sorrows and joys♫

190

333
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,310
A rabbit-shaped one.

334
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,640
Why are you always so quiet?

335
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,890
Let's chat.

336
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,240
It's so lively today.

337
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:55,880
Last time, you said

338
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,720
your home is in a place far to the north.

339
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,110
Where exactly is that?

340
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:02,960
It's just a very distant place.

341
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,310
Is it cold there?

342
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,510
Yes.

343
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,720
Is it lively there?

344
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,270
Any festivals?

345
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:15,400
Do you have Lantern Festivals?

346
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:17,310
We don't do that.

347
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,590
What's the point of celebrating this festival?

348
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,920
How could it be pointless?

349
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:24,680
We humans

350
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,030
often celebrate the Lantern Festival.

351
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,000
So many times

352
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:28,440
that the organizers are tired of it,

353
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,660
and the people who watch it are tired of it too.

354
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,170
But it still keeps going on.

355
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,200
Because it carries

356
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,920
a lot of our beautiful hopes.

357
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,590
We hope for harmony, peace,

358
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,680
and good fortune throughout the year.

359
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,890
We pray for the blessings

360
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,550
of the gods in heaven.

361
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:44,960
What's the point of all these

362
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,750
hopes

363
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,110
and prayers of yours?

364
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,640
You work hard from dawn to dusk,

365
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,640
or else you won't even get three meals a day.

366
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:57,870
When you're injured or sick,

367
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,340
you have to seek out doctors and medicine.

368
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,510
Your lives are filled with busyness,

369
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,560
but before long, you grow old,

370
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,200
reaching the end of your lives.

371
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,480
Do these prayers to the gods really help?

372
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,360
Do the gods help you?

373
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,480
You're such a killjoy.

374
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,000
Fine.

375
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:17,160
I admit.

376
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,880
You have a point.

377
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:19,880
Praying to the gods

378
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,920
doesn't have any real effect.

379
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,110
But it gives us

380
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,720
inner strength.

381
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:26,920
It's like a light

382
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,510
far in the distance.

383
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,510
That light

384
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:31,550
is the hope of the human race.

385
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,070
At least it lets us know

386
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:34,640
where we should go.

387
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,960
So many lanterns! They're so beautiful!

388
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:41,930
Let's go.

389
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,310
Come on, let's go.

390
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:45,960
Let's take a look.

391
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,240
Look.

392
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:49,960
How beautiful they are!

393
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:51,790
That one is just like mine.

394
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:52,960
The rabbit shape.

395
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,920
There's also one in goldfish shape.

396
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:58,550
See? I told you they're beautiful.

397
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,270
Tanyin, what's wrong?

398
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,130
Tanyin, what's going on with you?

399
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,400
Why are you crying?

400
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,400
Did someone bully you?

401
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:27,000
Or did the High Priest scold you?

402
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,350
I guess that's it.

403
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:35,790
Well, as a handmaiden,

404
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,510
it's unavoidable to face some hardships.

405
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,550
It was the same for me when I was on the tower ship.

406
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,000
But I don't think the High Priest

407
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,880
is the type of person who scolds others

408
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,730
without reason.

409
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,820
I think I did something wrong.

410
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:54,780
Well, just fix it.

411
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,310
It can't be fixed.

412
00:23:57,790 --> 00:23:58,680
Why?

413
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,640
Because we're not on the same path.

414
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,400
Then why don't you take another path?

415
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,310
But I can't bring myself to do it.

416
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:10,160
Tanyin.

417
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,000
Alright, Tanyin.

418
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,920
Don't cry.

419
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:13,310
I don't understand

420
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:14,550
what path you're talking about.

421
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:15,640
But since they are paths,

422
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:16,740
if we take the wrong one,

423
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,280
we can always change to another, right?

424
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,920
Even if, hypothetically,

425
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,040
we can no longer

426
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:22,270
walk a different path,

427
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,000
can't we just

428
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:24,240
treat the path we're on

429
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,000
as part of

430
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,830
our journey?

431
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:28,200
Anyway, on the path you took,

432
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,960
there must be moments of joy

433
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,020
and times when you felt it was the right one,

434
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,430
right?

435
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:35,910
Anyway, Tanyin,

436
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,650
stop being so sad.

437
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,520
I feel really bad seeing you cry.

438
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:40,680
How about you sit here,

439
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,200
and I'll go to the kitchen

440
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,350
to make you something delicious?

441
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:42,750
Once you're full,

442
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,070
you won't be so sad.

443
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:49,890
What are you doing here?

444
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,440
Nothing.

445
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,310
Tanyin is feeling down.

446
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:56,000
Go inside

447
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,960
and help me take care of her.

448
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,590
Hurry up.

449
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:02,160
Don't leave her alone.

450
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:06,200
Go.

451
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:07,960
Go!

452
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:25,070
Get some sleep.

453
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,030
I can't fall asleep.

454
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,880
Because of Yuanzhong?

455
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,840
You've already confirmed something, right?

456
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,750
What did you see?

457
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,720
You should have guessed it.

458
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,960
I haven't.

459
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:47,640
The High Priest of the Youhu Clan

460
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,510
is more multifaceted than expected.

461
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,440
I really didn't expect it.

462
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,590
I must find a way.

463
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,900
I will definitely come up with a solution.

464
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:09,550
Ji Tanyin,

465
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,720
the children of the War Demons

466
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,210
were taught from a young age

467
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:15,470
to not fear death.

468
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:16,920
But when they hear the words

469
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,310
"High Priest,"

470
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,160
they can't help but shiver.

471
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:23,480
Do you know why?

472
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,790
Why?

473
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,270
In our clan, there's a legend

474
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:31,320
that says he is a monster

475
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,030
who can hear a thousand miles away, see a hundred yards,

476
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,590
has a green face and sharp fangs, devours hearts and eats people,

477
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:37,680
and moves like a ghost.

478
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:39,640
And that he is the devil who leads the Youhu Clan

479
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,920
in frequently invading our clan.

480
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,920
When we were kids, we all believed it.

481
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:50,590
But when I actually saw Yuanzhong,

482
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,750
I felt that,

483
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,590
on one hand, he resembled the legend,

484
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,720
and on the other hand, he didn't.

485
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,440
What do you mean?

486
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,350
He's a solitary person

487
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,510
with a weird temper

488
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,070
and shows no mercy when killing our people.

489
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,720
Isn't this the behavior of a monster?

490
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,510
That's on the battlefield.

491
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,440
Yes.

492
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:15,110
The War Demons fear his divine power.

493
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,550
But we didn't expect

494
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:17,880
that the Youhu Clan and the human race

495
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,830
also see him as a great threat.

496
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,680
He's the one leading

497
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,070
and protecting the Youhu Clan.

498
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,830
But the Youhu Clan is suspicious of him

499
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:26,000
and even resents him.

500
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:28,920
Though we don't know

501
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,400
where this resentment comes from.

502
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,550
I really don't know

503
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:33,200
if this is Yuanzhong's karma.

504
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,640
He is a hero of both the human race

505
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,160
and the Youhu Clan.

506
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:37,880
Yet, he has not received

507
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,400
the glory and admiration that heroes deserve.

508
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,110
Instead, he is constantly restricted

509
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:43,240
and subjected to harm.

510
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,480
If it were me in his place,

511
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,390
I would go mad too.

512
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:51,200
He's not just being suspected

513
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,830
and having his actions restricted.

514
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:54,110
What he's gone through

515
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,750
is a hundred times worse than that.

516
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,270
What exactly are you trying to say?

517
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,200
I just want to tell you

518
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:05,720
that he has his own karma.

519
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:07,030
His world

520
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:08,220
is already in ruins.

521
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,400
Those who are abandoned by the heavenly way

522
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,480
do not believe in it.

523
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,220
Whatever he wants to do,

524
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:14,640
you alone

525
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,730
cannot stop him.

526
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:17,730
Since you can't change anything,

527
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:19,330
don't dwell on it too much

528
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,750
and suffer for nothing.

529
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,270
It's not that easy.

530
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:26,850
Yes, but...

531
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:27,590
Alright.

532
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:29,000
I'm tired.

533
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:30,960
I want to be alone for a while.

534
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,160
Well, get some rest.

535
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,200
Mr. Jin, Mrs. Jin, congratulations

536
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,200
on your son's birth.

537
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:56,060
The Young Master really looks cheerful.

538
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:57,750
You're a sensible one.

539
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:58,750
Leave us and collect your reward.

540
00:29:58,750 --> 00:29:59,350
Remember,

541
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:00,790
don't say anything you shouldn't.

542
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:01,390
Yes.

543
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:05,920
Look, this child is so easy to manage.

544
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:08,100
You can't eat this.

545
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,240
Go to the private kitchen and get some pastries.

546
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:11,920
-Anyway,
-Yes.

547
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:13,810
we now finally have an heir in the family.

548
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:14,750
I'll see who dares

549
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,440
gossip behind our backs in the future.

550
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:17,640
Indeed.

551
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,590
Our ancestors are blessing us

552
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:20,720
by having us buy—

553
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:22,440
give birth

554
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,750
to such a good boy.

555
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,000
We'll hold a banquet tomorrow.

556
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:27,240
Inform the family elders

557
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,680
and the nephews from all branches.

558
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:29,830
Let's gather together.

559
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,070
Hubby, how could you not understand it?

560
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,160
Didn't the second son

561
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,270
of the Wang family say?

562
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:36,240
This child's parents

563
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,510
aren't locals.

564
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,960
Let's wait a few more days.

565
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
It won't be too late to hold the banquet

566
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,590
after they leave the town.

567
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:44,440
You are more thoughtful than i am.

568
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:45,740
I got carried away with my excitement

569
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:46,480
and lost my rationality.

570
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,850
What's important now

571
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,750
is to give our son a name.

572
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:52,110
What should we call him?

573
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:55,750
Hubby, look.

574
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,720
The other day, on the street, this child

575
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,440
wanted Beanie's longevity lock.

576
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:00,240
And now,

577
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,720
he's taken a liking to my gold necklace.

578
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,590
This child

579
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:04,030
is definitely one of our Jin family.

580
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:05,030
He recognizes gold.

581
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:05,790
Here.

582
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:06,750
Take it.

583
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:07,790
I'll give you

584
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:08,960
whatever you like.

585
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:12,900
Here.

586
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,030
Why are you still awake so late?

587
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:25,960
I can't sleep.

588
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,440
Who stripped your magic source?

589
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:34,890
Our chief.

590
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,380
Why?

591
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:39,070
I offended her.

592
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:40,550
Just because you offended her,

593
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:42,180
you received such a severe punishment?

594
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:47,030
Do you understand the War Demons?

595
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,640
I only know that

596
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,640
the War Demons used to belong to the divine race.

597
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,840
But that was thousands of years ago.

598
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:54,960
Later,

599
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:56,640
someone in our clan made a mistake,

600
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,790
and the whole clan was punished and sent to the mortal realm.

601
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,880
The heroes in our clan were determined

602
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,200
to make military merits in the war

603
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,110
between gods and demons

604
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:04,480
so that we could rejoin the divine race.

605
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:05,880
So, in that war,

606
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,920
they were especially brave.

607
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:08,350
Unexpectedly,

608
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,550
the sacrifice of our clan members was extremely heavy.

609
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,550
But after that,

610
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:15,200
you did not receive any official titles.

611
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:17,350
The divine race did not fulfill

612
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:18,480
their promises made before the war.

613
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,110
The celestial ladder was broken.

614
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,510
And we lost contact

615
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:22,750
with the gods.

616
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,720
In desperation,

617
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,200
the War Demons had no choice

618
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,200
but to stay in the Mortal Realm.

619
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:29,070
For survival,

620
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:30,440
we frequently clashed

621
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,400
with the human race and the Youhu Clan,

622
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:33,030
who had lived and multiplied in the Mortal Realm for generations.

623
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:36,790
That's why

624
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:39,440
the Battle of Pinghu broke out?

625
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:42,260
Yes.

626
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,440
In the Battle of Pinghu,

627
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:47,160
the War Demons were suppressed by the High Priest's

628
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,240
divine power.

629
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:50,440
During the two major wars within a thousand years,

630
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,310
nearly 90% of the War Demons' young men

631
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:53,790
died on the battlefield.

632
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,110
This crisis of annihilation

633
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:56,510
continued until now.

634
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,640
The War Demons gradually faded into

635
00:32:59,070 --> 00:32:59,880
hiding in

636
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,240
the isolated hidden towns.

637
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,640
The resources available for survival

638
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,750
are simply too few.

639
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:06,000
Even having offspring has become a problem.

640
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:08,480
In order to have more children,

641
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,670
the clan began to implement a system of fluid marriages.

642
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,120
What is the fluid marriage system?

643
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:19,250
All adult men and women

644
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:21,280
are matched by the Chief.

645
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:22,510
If they fail to have children

646
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,810
within two years of marriage,

647
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,180
they will be forcibly separated

648
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:26,300
and paired with someone else.

649
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:29,240
After having one child,

650
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:30,240
if they fail to conceive again

651
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,110
within three years,

652
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:33,880
they will also be separated.

653
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,790
Doesn't this rule

654
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,160
treat all the women

655
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:38,920
among the War Demons

656
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,510
as mere breeding tools?

657
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,510
Yes.

658
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:43,790
They have to be breeding tools

659
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:45,350
that can endure the pain of separation

660
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:46,400
from their flesh and blood.

661
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:47,510
Then you...

662
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:49,270
My mother was such a woman.

663
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,110
My father fell seriously ill.

664
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:55,440
In order to let him see her one more time

665
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,590
before he died,

666
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:58,200
I had to go to one hidden town after another

667
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:59,960
to search for her.

668
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:02,310
Did you find her?

669
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:05,720
I guess you could say I found her.

670
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,400
But to let them meet,

671
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:09,110
to take her away,

672
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,550
I needed a merit.

673
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:14,150
So, all those times

674
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:15,840
you tried to assassinate Yuanzhong

675
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,230
were to gain merit?

676
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,400
You almost succeeded.

677
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,550
But,

678
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:30,000
before I could see my mother,

679
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,030
she died.

680
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:33,960
The War Demons originally belonged to the divine race.

681
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,480
Even living to a thousand years

682
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,400
is no problem.

683
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,670
But according to the current clan rules,

684
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,840
women who can't bear children

685
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:42,480
must be killed.

686
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:44,280
Only through their death

687
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:46,000
can they give more hope of life

688
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,320
to the newborns.

689
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,110
Ji Tanyin,

690
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:52,880
they all say

691
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,320
that to survive,

692
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,960
sacrifices must be made.

693
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,800
They say I'm wrong.

694
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,440
Is that true?

695
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:02,670
If you thought that way too,

696
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,030
you wouldn't be

697
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:05,440
suffering like this now.

698
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:07,150
You don't have to force yourself

699
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:08,840
to agree with others' opinions.

700
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,320
You're still young.

701
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,510
Don't trap yourself

702
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:12,920
in hatred.

703
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:14,840
But...

704
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,420
the War Demons did become stronger

705
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:19,110
through her methods.

706
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,070
So, do you think

707
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:21,440
this is sacrificing the less important

708
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:22,610
for the greater good?

709
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,230
Isn't it?

710
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:26,800
Are you "the less important"?

711
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:29,240
Who decided that you are "the less important"?

712
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:32,960
What is "the less important"?

713
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,140
And what is "the greater good"?

714
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,630
Qian Lin,

715
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,920
perhaps the individual

716
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:39,760
should obey the collective.

717
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:41,150
But the premise for obedience should be

718
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:42,190
that the collective

719
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:44,000
can better protect the individual.

720
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,590
If the individual is already shattered,

721
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,840
forever living in darkness

722
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,440
and tragic despair,

723
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,890
then such a collective

724
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,360
no longer needs to exist

725
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,730
or to be protected.

726
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:00,840
You didn't do anything wrong.

727
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,840
What about Yuanzhong?

728
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,840
Did he do anything wrong?

729
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:48,050
[Gold and Jade]

730
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,710
Who are you?

731
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,670
Thief!

732
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:55,030
Catch the thief!

733
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:56,330
Guards!

734
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,510
Catch the thief!

735
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:35,840
Xiu?

736
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:38,110
Where's Ji Tanyin?

737
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:40,390
She's gone.

738
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:49,030
Where did she go?

739
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,800
Why are you asking this?

740
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,360
Which noble family did you rob

741
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,110
to grow so tall?

742
00:37:57,410 --> 00:37:59,000
That family stole a child.

743
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:00,670
They're not good people.

744
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:02,670
Moreover, they're all going to die.

745
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:04,070
What's the point

746
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:05,070
of keeping their wealth?

747
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:08,440
That makes sense.

748
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:10,960
Let's drink.

749
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,760
I can't eat anything else.

750
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,760
That's true.

751
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,440
It's a pity that Zi Fei and Kai Shan

752
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,320
aren't here.

753
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:22,030
There's no one here to drink with me.

754
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:25,760
Yuanzhong,

755
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,720
can you bear to part with Ji Tanyin?

756
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:36,710
Whether I can bear it or not,

757
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,110
what difference does it make?

758
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:41,150
I don't know the real her,

759
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,590
and she doesn't know the real me.

760
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:46,980
If we were to be completely honest with each other,

761
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,150
I'm afraid we'd immediately

762
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,760
draw a line

763
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,670
and go separate ways.

764
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,840
Are you afraid?

765
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:04,920
The five of us

766
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,560
are the weapon spirits of the Divine Left Hand,

767
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:09,270
formed by the primordial power,

768
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,400
and created from the void.

769
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:13,280
Our understanding of life and death

770
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,440
is different from that

771
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,480
of mortal beings.

772
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:17,480
We coalesce because of you

773
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:19,000
and dissipate because of you.

774
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:22,430
So, when you hate,

775
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,190
we hate;

776
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:25,590
when you are afraid,

777
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,110
we are afraid;

778
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:28,630
when you hesitate,

779
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:30,320
we hesitate;

780
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,400
when you let go,

781
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,190
we let go.

782
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:38,110
So, Yuanzhong,

783
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:39,510
why do I

784
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:40,800
want to see Ji Tanyin so badly?

785
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:02,400
Found it!

786
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,920
Ling Yao's seal is about to be broken.

787
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,560
♫Ask the heavens♫

788
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:56,460
♫I don't know why I'm without a home♫

789
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,760
♫I'm at a dead end♫

790
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:59,580
♫And I have to surrender and accept my destiny♫

791
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,330
♫I'm the wandering one♫

792
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:03,150
♫My body and mind, falling into dust♫

793
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:05,180
♫Only the moon in the sky♫

794
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:06,700
♫Shines upon the lifelong decay♫

795
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,830
♫The scars you can't see♫

796
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:10,720
♫Are the proof of my struggle♫

797
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,510
♫Be your own last straw of hope♫

798
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,220
♫Why do you have to go alone?♫

799
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,810
♫Let me learn to be fearless♫

800
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:17,510
♫I live with no regrets♫

801
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:18,900
♫Who deserves to be crushed?♫

802
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:21,430
♫Don't tell me what's right or wrong♫

803
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:24,200
♫I rebel against fate♫

804
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:28,060
♫I'm willing to risk my life♫

♫No matter how dangerous it is♫

♫I will travel the world and scatter the fog♫

Elder, this...

808
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:37,980
♫The flowing water does not compete for the lead♫

809
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:41,720
♫For millennia, all will turn to dust♫

810
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:44,970
♫With our feet on the earth and the sky above♫

811
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,730
♫We, the heroes of our time, are no ordinary beings♫

812
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:51,550
♫The flowing water does not compete for the lead♫

813
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:56,280
[Ningrui Pavilion]

814
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:55,150
♫In my heart, there are no ripples, as if a god resides within♫

815
00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:58,650
♫I ride the wind and embrace the moon♫

816
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:02,150
♫The raging river in my dreams has never ceased♫

817
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:02,630
Could it be that Yuanzhong

818
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,800
has broken all the seals of the weapon spirits?

819
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:07,940
It's the primordial power.

820
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,190
It seems

821
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:13,590
that the High Priest of the Youhu Clan

822
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:15,440
has broken all the seals

823
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,670
of the Divine Left Hand.

824
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:18,120
With Taihe not here,

825
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,800
he is now the only one

826
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,780
with the primordial power in the world.

827
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,230
No one can lay a finger on him anymore.

828
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:25,800
Not necessarily.

829
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,830
Sixty years ago,

830
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:29,650
he was as powerful as he is now,

831
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:30,960
but in the end,

832
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,590
he was tricked into sealing his power

833
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:34,110
and became useless.

834
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,030
Having the power alone,

835
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:38,100
without the matching wisdom,

836
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,670
he may not be able

837
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:40,830
to hold onto this power.

838
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:48,420
What I mean is that

839
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,760
the primordial power

840
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,450
is not that easy to control.

841
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,480
Even someone as powerful as Deity Taihe

842
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,880
was once harmed by a demon.

843
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:56,360
If one is not steadfast enough,

844
00:42:56,470 --> 00:42:58,590
their power can instead become a curse.

845
00:42:58,830 --> 00:43:01,750
I hope he can use this power wisely

846
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:04,000
and live out his life under the care

847
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,290
of Goddess Wushuang,

848
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,630
without wasting

849
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:09,820
the opportunity we have given him.

850
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:28,290
Why did the sky suddenly brighten?
