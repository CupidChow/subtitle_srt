[A Moment But Forever]

2
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:47,280
[Episode 34]

3
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,479
Look.

4
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,950
I've suppressed Mr. Loong too.

5
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,870
Only we are left.

6
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,510
If you still regard me as your sister,

7
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,350
give me your Divine Hand.

8
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,560
I have the Divine Hand.

9
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,710
Where is Taihe?

10
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,590
You saw him already.

11
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,080
Don't try to fool me.

12
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,930
The Divine Left Hand

13
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,230
doesn't sense him at all.

14
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,630
We had a sisterly bond.

15
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:27,400
I treasure our

16
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:28,960
thousand-year relationship.

17
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,820
So, no matter what I did these years,

18
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,680
I held back a bit for you.

19
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,120
You know it very well.

20
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,710
If I'd wanted to hurt you,

21
00:02:36,829 --> 00:02:38,150
you wouldn't be alive now.

22
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,850
Is Taihe the demon or not?

23
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,470
Where is his divine body?

24
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,310
You always like to help others.

25
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,520
Please help me this time.

26
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,590
Give me the Divine Hand

27
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,430
and I'll listen to

28
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,310
whatever you say in the future.

29
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,630
If he is really the demon,

30
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:50,710
then what happened during

31
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:51,840
the war between gods and demons?

32
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,000
Only the Divine Hand,

33
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,560
only you, can help me.

34
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,030
You love Taihe so much.

35
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,140
If he really died,

36
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,150
you wouldn't just obsessed with

37
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,470
getting this Divine Hand.

38
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,770
So he's alive.

39
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,960
The demon is still alive.

40
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,910
You want to use this Divine Hand

41
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,240
to revive the demonized Taihe,

42
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,000
right?

43
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,280
Do you have to do this?

44
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,560
Tell me.

45
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,280
Fine.

46
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,800
You want to know?

47
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,800
Give me your Divine Hand in exchange.

48
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,280
If you don't tell me,

49
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,360
I'll destroy it.

50
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,280
Don't be silly.

51
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,800
You lost your divine bone and have no divine power.

52
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,030
You can't destroy it.

53
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,680
I made this divine artifact myself.

54
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:49,180
Even if I'm a mortal,

55
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,840
I can still destroy it.

56
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,079
Do you want to give it a try?

57
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,630
Okay.

58
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,320
I can tell you.

59
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,680
But let me correct you.

60
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,650
I've never loved Taihe.

61
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,120
Love is either torturing yourself

62
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,470
or torturing others.

63
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,620
I don't need it.

64
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,190
You've just tasted love.

65
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,070
You should know better than me.

66
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,260
Tell me.

67
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,270
It's a long story.

68
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,100
You know a bit

69
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,409
about my past.

70
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,080
Do you remember Chu?

71
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,159
Your little sister in the mortal realm?

72
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,870
Just like you,

73
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,810
she was my lovely little sister.

74
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:52,480
I doted on her, cared for her, and loved her.

75
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,770
In order to give her a good life,

76
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,600
I embroidered day and night to earn money.

77
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,510
I just wished I could earn enough

78
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,480
to cover all her expenses for the rest of her life.

79
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,000
When I was about to be burned

80
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,190
to death

81
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,600
and wronged by everyone,

82
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,360
the one I worried about the most

83
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,440
was still her.

84
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,800
You once told me

85
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,600
I look like Chu,

86
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,040
so you treated me

87
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,120
as your sister.

88
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,120
For this,

89
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,560
I'm grateful

90
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,270
and respect you.

91
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,070
Actually, I didn't tell you

92
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,190
that I went to the mortal realm secretly.

93
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,680
I found that the person who framed me

94
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,310
was my sister Chu.

95
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:37,920
I stopped her

96
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,510
from marrying that loser,

97
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,630
so she wanted to kill me.

98
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,800
Chu.

99
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,480
I won’t allow you to go.

100
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,310
I forbid you from seeing him again.

101
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,830
He idles away his days without learning anything

102
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:53,870
and gambles every day.

103
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,480
He's not a good match for you.

104
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,560
He may not be good,

105
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,390
but his family is rich.

106
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,070
Hannv, if I marry him,

107
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:02,720
I won't have to

108
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,950
suffer anymore.

109
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,430
Don't worry.

110
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,310
I'll take more embroidery work.

111
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:09,270
I'll earn enough for your dowry as soon as possible.

112
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,160
Embroidery...

113
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,310
All you talk about is embroidery.

114
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,040
What else can you do

115
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,190
besides embroidery?

116
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:17,310
These rubbish!

117
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,270
Chu.

118
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,360
When can I

119
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,070
live a good life?

120
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,830
-How can I work if you do this?
-I just want to go see him.

121
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:22,560
Chu.

122
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,840
I still remember that fire.

123
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,800
It burned so fiercely.

124
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,600
I didn't seduce a man.

125
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,800
I was wronged.

126
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:37,159
I didn't!

127
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,510
I didn't seduce a man.

128
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,040
I'm innocent!

129
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,120
Burn her to death!

130
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:41,950
I really didn't.

131
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,070
I really didn't.

132
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:43,920
Burn her!

133
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,720
I really didn't.

134
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,560
I didn't seduce a man.

135
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm innocent!

136
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:54,390
I was wronged.

137
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,270
It hurt so much.

138
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,240
But the pain caused by Chu's betrayal

139
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,430
hurt thousands,

140
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:20,750
tens of thousands of times more,

141
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,750
than the fire.

142
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,600
I still don't understand.

143
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,560
I treated her so well.

144
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,720
Why did she do that?

145
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,430
Do you understand?

146
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,920
So you took revenge on her?

147
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,190
Yes.

148
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,630
If it were me,

149
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,630
I wouldn't have let them off.

150
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,560
Taihe stopped you.

151
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:49,600
Yes.

152
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,159
He told me,

153
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:52,720
"When virtue resides within,

154
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,500
one steadfastly cherishes oneself.

155
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:55,800
When vice resides within,

156
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,560
one inevitably despises oneself."

157
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,800
He also said

158
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,800
that everyone makes mistakes.

159
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,560
Being able to amend wrongs is the biggest virtue.

160
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,380
Be kind to the kind

161
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,430
and also to the unkind. That is true virtue.

162
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,040
To feel shame from wrongdoings,

163
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,310
a virtuous heart will arise.

164
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,390
To forgive others' mistakes

165
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,070
is one's own glory.

166
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,200
I memorized it well, right?

167
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,060
Because what he said made sense.

168
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:18,310
I was convinced by him.

169
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,560
I was willing to let go of my hatred

170
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,560
and cultivate with him.

171
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,720
At that time,

172
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,670
I thought I was so lucky.

173
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,630
I was a mere goddess,

174
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,480
but I was saved by Taihe,

175
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,630
the powerful Primordial God.

176
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,080
If he hadn't stop me in time,

177
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,720
I would have killed to vent my anger,

178
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,670
ruined my spiritual heart and fallen into demonic ways.

179
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,910
I wouldn't have been able to remain a god.

180
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:10,720
He told me

181
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,480
human nature is good.

182
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:14,840
Everyone makes mistakes.

183
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,000
Chu would definitely repent.

184
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:19,250
Just like that,

185
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,200
decades more went by.

186
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,120
Chu.

187
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:42,320
Ghost!

188
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:43,340
Ghost!

189
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,390
Ghost!

190
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:45,910
Ghost!

191
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,000
Ghost!

192
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,240
Ghost!

193
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,980
She thought I was a vengeful spirit

194
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:53,220
coming to take revenge on her.

195
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,450
She was the one who killed me,

196
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,750
but she had no remorse at all.

197
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,790
She blamed me for everything

198
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,000
and cursed me to never be free

199
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,070
of resentment.

200
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,050
Wasn't she vicious?

201
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,080
Why did she do this to me?

202
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,750
But she died just like that.

203
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,440
I thought those who were unkind

204
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,000
would suffer the consequences.

205
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,550
I thought those who fixed their mistakes

206
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,910
would have virtue.

207
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,670
No.

208
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,290
None of that happened.

209
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,080
I didn't want forgiveness

210
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,080
nor glory.

211
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,270
I just wanted revenge.

212
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,270
But she died like this.

213
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,090
I could never see her again.

214
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,030
What about my hatred?

215
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,510
What should I do with my hatred?

216
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,720
Everything has been handled?

217
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:54,630
Yes.

218
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,270
That's good.

219
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:12,560
So you didn't let go of the hatred.

220
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,000
Why should I?

221
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,150
How could I?

222
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,930
He said those principles

223
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,790
and he made sense.

224
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:20,960
I believed him too.

225
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,720
But Chu

226
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,480
didn't repent as he said.

227
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,870
They say that gods

228
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:26,270
all live freely and comfortably.

229
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,490
I'm neither carefree nor comfortable.

230
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,850
I'd rather have become a vengeful ghost

231
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,870
and ended this hatred long ago.

232
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,870
Becoming a god, I must suppress myself

233
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,600
and have selfless love.

234
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,270
What's the point of being a god?

235
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,120
Why?

236
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,790
So...

237
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,560
you started to hate Taihe?

238
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:44,600
Yes.

239
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,440
I hated him.

240
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,270
I hated him for being righteous,

241
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,360
pretentious,

242
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,640
and full of benevolence and morality.

243
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,240
But what could I do?

244
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,460
He was too strong.

245
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:58,000
I could only bury

246
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,280
all this hatred.

247
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,480
Until one day,

248
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:04,930
I discovered a big secret.

249
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:06,670
Our supreme

250
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:08,000
Primordial God

251
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,610
had anger,

252
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,240
desires,

253
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,630
and resentment too.

254
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:13,840
That's impossible!

255
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,720
The Primordial God

256
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,170
has no emotions or desires.

257
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:20,200
He is also of flesh and blood.

258
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,200
He looked down upon the Three Realms for thousands of years

259
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,240
and saw the conditions of all beings.

260
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,510
How could he not have emotions and desires?

261
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,360
They say the Primordial God

262
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,960
represents the justice of heaven and earth

263
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,360
and is absolutely fair.

264
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:34,910
You believe it?

265
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,200
He had hypocrisy,

266
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,440
obsession,

267
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,670
ignorance,

268
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,720
jealousy,

269
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,670
and cruelty.

270
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,000
He was no different from ordinary people.

271
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:48,480
But because

272
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,080
he was the Primordial God,

273
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,260
he could temporarily remove

274
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:53,600
and suppress these desires.

275
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,510
Over the years,

276
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,950
the malice he suppressed

277
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,870
grew more and more.

278
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,360
So you

279
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,770
released Taihe's malice?

280
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,390
You released the Demon Lord?

281
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,100
Yes, it was me.

282
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,960
Why shouldn't I?

283
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:12,030
If he could lecture me,

284
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:14,510
then he must be very clear-minded.

285
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,720
I wanted to see

286
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,730
if he could continue

287
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:22,080
to talk about kindness after tasting hardship.

288
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,040
Reality shows

289
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,610
he couldn't do it either.

290
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,120
The war between gods and demons

291
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,670
forced him to his wit's end.

292
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,910
Before he died, he had to cut off his Divine Hand

293
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,200
and break off the celestial ladder

294
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:37,080
to split the demon into two,

295
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,510
with half in the Heavenly Realm,

296
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,270
and the other half in the Divine Hand.

297
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:43,210
Although it will take some time,

298
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,930
if they're combined into one again,

299
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,960
he will be the new Demon Lord.

300
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,040
So Taihe is already dead.

301
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:54,510
You don't want this Divine Hand

302
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:56,150
for Taihe,

303
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,870
but to revive the Demon Lord.

304
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:58,800
That's right.

305
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,390
The world has the Five Sins.

306
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:03,080
Only after the baptism of death

307
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,840
can we return peace.

308
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,510
Yuanzhong originally had

309
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,010
the chance to do this,

310
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,410
but he's too useless.

311
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,200
For you,

312
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,790
he gave up such a great chance.

313
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:13,480
If he won't do it,

314
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:14,870
then I will.

315
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,390
You are a god worshipped

316
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,240
by the people.

317
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,550
I don't want to be a god!

318
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,670
I don't want to forgive

319
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,000
anyone again!

320
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,240
It's your turn to forgive me now.

321
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,790
I won't let you succeed!

322
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:31,190
In your dreams!

323
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:10,720
Drought Dragon!

324
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,060
Kill her.

325
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,790
Do it now.

326
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,720
This is the Heavenly Furnace I embroidered.

327
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,200
With the heaven and earth as the furnace,

328
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,390
fortune as the method,

329
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,750
and yin and yang as the charcoal,

330
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,150
it can refine everything.

331
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,200
Enjoy it.

332
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,350
Tanghua.

333
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,480
Tanghua.

334
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,480
Tanghua!

335
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:15,550
Where is Yuanzhong?

336
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,070
Tell him to come out and die.

337
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,720
He's already dead.

338
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,110
I don't believe it.

339
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,110
Your wish has come true.

340
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,550
Even if he's dead,

341
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,750
I want to chop his body into pieces.

342
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:46,680
In your dreams!

343
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,640
Qian Lin.

344
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,720
Qian Lin!

345
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,270
Qian Lin.

346
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,410
Are you alright?

347
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,700
Greetings, Goddess.

348
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,310
Goddess of Embroidery.

349
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:22,880
Stop!

350
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,000
How are you?

351
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,390
Here.

352
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,070
The demon has been hiding in the Divine Hand for many years

353
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,960
and finally chose Yuanzhong

354
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,160
as the host.

355
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,450
It wanted to use his body

356
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,240
to absorb the mortal realm's malice,

357
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:52,650
but he was such a disappointment.

358
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:54,350
He suffered so many

359
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:55,750
grievances and hardships,

360
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:57,550
and he wanted revenge,

361
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,980
but he always stopped at the last moment.

362
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,710
I really don't understand.

363
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:04,310
He had

364
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,720
so much power.

365
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,450
How could he hold it in?

366
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,240
Fortunately,

367
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:12,090
he fell in love with you

368
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,400
and eventually died because of you.

369
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,130
Now his body

370
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:18,940
is the best hotbed for the demon.

371
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:23,160
The demon will resurrect in his body.

372
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,440
Yuanzhong?

373
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,280
He's not Yuanzhong.

374
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:59,760
I, Li Chaoyang, Chief of the War Demons,

375
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,270
welcome the Demon Lord.

376
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:13,140
The War Demon Clan is willing to die for you.

377
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,440
You still know to come?

378
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,440
You all work for the heavens.

379
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,920
Learn from the tribulations.

380
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,790
Every now and then, regardless of day or night,

381
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:44,860
it comes whenever it wants.

382
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,400
Now,

383
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,350
every time I see gray clouds,

384
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,480
my heart starts pounding.

385
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,640
Hey, I'm just speaking from my heart.

386
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,920
Why are you mad?

387
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:56,440
Since you're here,

388
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,370
give me a ride.

389
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:24,510
No one is here.

390
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,750
The Heavenly Realm

391
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:28,030
is really cold and quiet.

392
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:38,710
How is it?

393
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:43,880
The smell of freedom is everywhere.

394
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,310
It's sweet.

395
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,200
I didn't work hard to release you

396
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:50,480
so you can

397
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,750
just enjoy freedom.

398
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:58,920
I don't need you to remind me.

399
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:02,580
I’ll wait and see.

400
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,520
My Lord,

401
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:18,200
all the War Demons have assembled.

402
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,590
We are at your disposal.

403
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,030
Who is the strongest in the Mortal Realm?

404
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:28,030
The Youhu Clan.

405
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:30,590
Okay.

406
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,400
Let's start from there.

407
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,800
Yes, Demon Lord.

408
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:50,960
Wushuang,

409
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,960
don't waste your time.

410
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,110
If it was so easy to get out,

411
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:57,480
I wouldn't have been trapped for so long.

412
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:59,420
In this world,

413
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,550
there are no magical artifacts that can trap me.

414
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,240
Is anyone there?

415
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:36,880
Did I disturb you?

416
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:39,230
Lord Mei Shan?

417
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:41,760
Are you Ji Tanyin?

418
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:43,470
It's me.

419
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,190
Wait.

420
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,240
Why are you here?

421
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,200
Are all palaces in the Divine Realm

422
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,350
so special?

423
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:49,240
I'm already here.

424
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,550
Why don't you invite me in?

425
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:51,820
I'm trapped here.

426
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,960
Work with me

427
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,000
to break through the furnace.

428
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,850
Step back. Leave it to me.

429
00:29:58,940 --> 00:29:59,660
Okay.

430
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:24,610
What are you doing here?

431
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,790
It's a long story.

432
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:26,830
We'll talk about it later.

433
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:27,880
Mr. Loong,

434
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:29,750
go to the Discipline Hall and invite the five divine lords.

435
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:30,680
I'll stop Hannv.

436
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,310
Okay.

437
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,470
Let's go.

438
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:40,960
Report!

439
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,070
The High Priest has led the War Demons

440
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:43,070
to break through the gate.

441
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,160
Is it really the High Priest?

442
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:45,890
Yes.

443
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I saw him clearly.

444
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,130
It's the High Priest.

445
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,140
Get into position!

446
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,350
My Lord, what are you looking at?

447
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:10,480
[Hall of Elders]

448
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:10,130
There's a lot of resentment here.

449
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:12,190
I like it.

450
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:00,880
Submit to me.

451
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,880
You're delusional!

452
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:15,880
Or die.

453
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,310
Are you Yuanzhong

454
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:22,070
or the Demon Lord?

455
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,240
It doesn't matter who you

456
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,200
view me as.

457
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,110
What matters is

458
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:29,880
I saw your actions

459
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,970
in the sea of consciousness.

460
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:34,590
You want to live.

461
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:36,630
Nothing wrong with that.

462
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,860
The original rule of the world

463
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,030
was survival of the fittest.

464
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:46,220
Be my disciple

465
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,670
and I'll grant you eternal life.

466
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,720
I'm willing to submit.

467
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:06,350
That's right.

468
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:09,760
What about you?

469
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:12,020
I...

470
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:29,250
Who else?

471
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:35,750
I'm willing to submit.

472
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,440
I'm willing to submit.

473
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,880
I'm willing to submit.

474
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,110
I'm willing to submit.

475
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:44,070
I'm willing to submit.

476
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:45,160
I'm willing to submit.

477
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,360
I'm willing to submit.

478
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:54,720
[Fragrant Grove]

479
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:21,710
Yuanzhong is missing.

480
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,280
It seems

481
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,440
they have succeeded.

482
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:31,320
Ji Tanyin!

483
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,320
Where is Yuanzhong?

484
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,469
Where are Tanghua and Zhi Dai?

485
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:35,630
Li Chaoyang came.

486
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,710
Tanghua was taken away.

487
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:37,380
Yuanzhong...

488
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,670
Yuanzhong was possessed.

489
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:16,360
Hannv.

490
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:18,960
My Lord, you look great today.

491
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:20,900
It seems that the submission of the ants

492
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,070
has made you happy.

493
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,190
No.

494
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:29,230
It's the fear of the ants

495
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:30,590
that makes me happy.

496
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,360
What's wrong?

497
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:34,480
Good news.

498
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:35,840
We have news of victory.

499
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,110
It's "I."

500
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:40,240
I have news of victory,

501
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:42,080
not us.

502
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,110
Yes.

503
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:47,210
Your news of victory, My Lord.

504
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:49,440
Tell me.

505
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:52,200
Fangwai Mountain was taken successfully.

506
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,110
The disobedient Youhu Clan members

507
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,190
have all been detained.

508
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:57,480
All clans and tribes have responded

509
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,360
they are willing to obey your wishes

510
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,650
and submit to you.

511
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,670
Shortly after, they will pay tribute

512
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:04,230
and send many hostage princes.

513
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,700
Now only the Yandu City of the human race

514
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:08,890
is still rebellious and fighting stubbornly,

515
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:11,010
but they're already weak.

516
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:12,230
Like an insect blocking a carriage,

517
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,280
I doubt they'll have

518
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,280
much success.

519
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:16,830
This is the report of all clans that have submitted to you.

520
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,470
My Lord, please have a look.

521
00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:37,970
All tribes submitted,

522
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,030
hostage princes have been detained,

523
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:42,320
and tribute has been paid.

524
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,480
Am I going to be an emperor?

525
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,540
Next, should I pardon the world,

526
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,800
unify the currency,

527
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,440
guard the frontier, launch construction projects,

528
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:56,060
build temples and canals,

529
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:57,170
and finally build myself

530
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:58,560
a big mausoleum?

531
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:00,150
I thought...

532
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:01,320
You thought?

533
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,590
What do you think I am?

534
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,550
An ordinary spirit

535
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,110
or a pet you're raising?

536
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:14,440
D-Demon Lord...

537
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:22,900
You begged me to help you overturn the world.

538
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,960
I will do it.

539
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:26,710
But

540
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:29,340
it must be with my method.

541
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:36,340
Why are you glaring at me?

542
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,880
Do you want me gouge

543
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,000
your eyes out?

544
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:41,650
Hannv,

545
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,540
remember this.

546
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,880
Remember well

547
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:47,540
that I am the master.

548
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:49,610
You are the servant.

549
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:55,310
I know you're not willing.

550
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,510
You don't have to.

551
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,150
I know you're good at acting.

552
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:02,710
Continue your acting then.

553
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:05,910
Act humble and obedient.

554
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:08,310
Act smart and capable.

555
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:13,050
I almost forgot.

556
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,930
You can't even pretend

557
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:18,190
to be smart and capable.

558
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:24,320
Do you know what

559
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,420
the biggest problem you gods have?

560
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,880
It's being pedantic

561
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:30,990
and spiritless.

562
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,550
If I wanted to create

563
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:39,920
an eternal demon nation,

564
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:43,510
that would be so boring.

565
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:00,550
Have the left side

566
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:02,710
attack Yandu.

567
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:05,150
Regardless of gender and age,

568
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:07,230
kill them all.

569
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,340
When it's done,

570
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:12,050
have those on the right side

571
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:14,830
ambush the ones on the left.

572
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:17,600
When they are all badly hurt,

573
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,400
you can lead the people from Fangwai Mountain

574
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:23,650
to capture them all.

575
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,070
And I will

576
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,800
come out in the end

577
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,800
and kill them all.

578
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:39,030
Kill...

579
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,920
Kill them all!

580
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,440
Just kidding.

581
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:51,800
You...

582
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,190
I'll keep you because you're still useful.

583
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:01,470
Anything else?

584
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:02,510
Nothing.

585
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:05,320
Rest assured, My Lord.

586
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:07,840
After I've done what I should do,

587
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:09,630
so what if I die?

588
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,650
Go back to work.

589
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:13,370
Yes.

590
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:54,070
The human race of Yandu is here to await orders.

591
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:56,040
Awaiting orders.

592
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,480
Awaiting orders.

593
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,440
What are you looking at?

594
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:23,110
Your acting is so bad.

595
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:25,760
I overestimated you.

596
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,360
I had a dream.

597
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,040
What did you dream about?

598
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:37,000
He hasn't given up yet.

599
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,190
Who?

600
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:41,420
Who are you talking about?

601
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,320
You mean the High Priest of the Youhu Clan?

602
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:52,760
He's not dead yet?

603
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,280
Not yet.

604
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,630
He's hiding in the deepest part of the sea of consciousness,

605
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:03,190
trying with his last breath to guard

606
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:06,190
the remaining bits of hope and joy in life.

607
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:10,030
The world's beings are so laughable.

608
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:12,510
He clearly suffered

609
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:14,150
so much pain,

610
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:17,000
but he still refuses to embrace the darkness

611
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,760
and refuses to submit to me.

612
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:22,720
He refuses to submit?

613
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,590
He's waiting for someone.

614
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:31,590
And I

615
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,480
am also waiting.
