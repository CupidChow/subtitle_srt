[A Moment But Forever]

2
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:47,150
[Episode 18]

3
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:48,920
Here.

4
00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:51,509
This wine is really good.

5
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,710
We have wine and meat here.

6
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:53,860
What's the special occasion today?

7
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,610
Of course, it's the day we're starting to renovate the house.

8
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:56,509
No.

9
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:00,690
Today is the day of our engagement.

10
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,600
So, the date is set?

11
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:04,680
Yes.

12
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:05,560
Today,

13
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,950
I went to Liu the Blind for a fortune-telling.

14
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:08,960
The 9th of next month is an auspicious day.

15
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,430
So I plan to

16
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:13,050
marry Yunniang on that day.

17
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,750
That's wonderful!

18
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,710
Isn't it just a few days away?

19
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:17,790
That's right.

20
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,680
Yes.

21
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,590
Just a few days.

22
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,800
Before we start,

23
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:24,600
I'd like to say something.

24
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:29,310
I have no father, no mother,

25
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,120
and my foster father, my only family, has passed away.

26
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,520
Yunniang's family is also gone.

27
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,470
Although you've only just arrived recently,

28
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:36,590
and we had

29
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,579
some misunderstandings when we first met,

30
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,890
over these past few days,

31
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:43,520
we've gotten along like long-time friends.

32
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,240
Since everyone's here today,

33
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,430
I'd like to ask you to be my witnesses.

34
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,400
Okay!

35
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,630
Yunniang.

36
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:58,840
Yunniang.

37
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:03,000
From now on,

38
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,190
we'll be living together.

39
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,630
Thank you for not minding my poverty.

40
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:06,990
I know

41
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,310
I have

42
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,120
all sorts of flaws.

43
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,280
But I have

44
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,630
a true heart that

45
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,240
I'm not afraid to show you.

46
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,280
I won't say much about the future.

47
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,280
You'll see for yourself.

48
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:21,030
I will definitely work hard to protect you,

49
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:21,750
to stay by your side,

50
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,400
and take care of you for the rest of my life.

51
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,470
Yunniang,

52
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,310
if you have any requests for me,

53
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,240
just say them.

54
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,430
I'm sure I can fulfill them.

55
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,360
I don't have any requests for you.

56
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:32,630
It's just that the last time,

57
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,840
when I married that unlucky guy,

58
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,360
he passed away before I even

59
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,360
stepped into his house.

60
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,710
Really disappointing.

61
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:38,990
He left me a widow for no reason.

62
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,320
So,

63
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,360
I only have one request for you.

64
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,230
Pei Jiu,

65
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:45,910
you must live a long life

66
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,079
and stay with me through this lifetime.

67
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,030
Okay.

68
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,800
Let's all have a drink together!

69
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,630
Come on.

70
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,630
Wish you a long life and a happy marriage.

71
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:57,800
May you have children soon.

72
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,000
May you stay safe.

73
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,450
Thank you, everyone.

74
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:04,400
Cool!

75
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:04,910
It's really good!

76
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:05,630
Jiu,

77
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,560
today, you should have

78
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,710
invited your master.

79
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,150
Where is Mr. Yuan?

80
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,590
Yuanzhong has already eaten,

81
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,280
so he's not coming.

82
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,950
How about I make a new set of furniture

83
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:20,950
as a gift for you two?

84
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,000
Tables, chairs,

85
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,310
and baby beds—

86
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,040
just tell me anything you like,

87
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,800
and I can make it

88
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,680
for you.

89
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,360
That's wonderful! Thank you.

90
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,070
Come on, come on.

91
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:31,940
Let's have a drink!

92
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,250
If I don't drink you under the table today,

93
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,120
I won't call myself Kai Shan anymore.

94
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,040
Congratulations.

95
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,430
If you put it that way,

96
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,720
do you think you can outdrink me?

97
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:49,480
Mr. Tanghua, have you ever been to Yandu?

98
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,120
Never.

99
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,950
This is my first time seeing

100
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,800
such a big, bustling city of the human race.

101
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,000
Yandu...

102
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,310
seems like a city that appeared out of nowhere.

103
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,560
Appeared out of nowhere?

104
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,310
That's right.

105
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,950
When it first appeared in the history books of the human race,

106
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,480
it was already a city.

107
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,480
According to my people's historical records,

108
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,480
this place was originally surrounded by steep mountains,

109
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,560
with dangerous terrain,

110
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,120
and was a desolate area.

111
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,630
But one day,

112
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,310
a passing merchant caravan

113
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,240
suddenly discovered

114
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,720
that a city had appeared here.

115
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,680
The news of this city's appearance

116
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,120
quickly spread.

117
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,800
While the world was shocked,

118
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,630
everyone wanted to claim it for themselves.

119
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:27,870
Back then,

120
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,270
Chenshang Kingdom and Qiong Kingdom

121
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:31,120
fought a long and drawn-out war

122
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,070
over the ownership

123
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,510
of Yandu,

124
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:36,270
but neither side could claim victory.

125
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,390
It wasn't until the war between gods and demons,

126
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:41,240
when the flames of war from the Divine Realm spread to the Mortal Realm,

127
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,560
that it came to an end.

128
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,870
After the Battle of Pinghu,

129
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,120
the human race finally realized

130
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,430
the importance of unity.

131
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,560
Although people are still divided into different countries,

132
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:50,950
there is little conflict now,

133
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,510
and Yandu has become completely independent,

134
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,159
turning into

135
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:56,720
the bustling city of trade it is today.

136
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,480
The Scholar's Wall,

137
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,920
tool shops, and the Craftsmanship Museum

138
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,240
are all unique features of Yandu.

139
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,190
You really know a lot

140
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,400
about Yandu.

141
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,360
I was born here, so naturally, I know.

142
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,870
Are you here in Yandu on business?

143
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,000
No, just sightseeing.

144
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,950
I heard that since the Craftsmanship Museum

145
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:17,310
came under the management of the Merchant Association,

146
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,190
they've started charging an entrance fee.

147
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:20,420
I was thinking of

148
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:21,860
going there in the next few days to take a look.

149
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:24,480
How much is the entrance fee?

150
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,590
I don't know about that.

151
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,070
These

152
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:29,240
are usually handled by Jiuguang and others.

153
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,480
Right.

154
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,310
Sir, you have a noble background

155
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,560
and refined taste.

156
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,800
How could you care about such trivial matters?

157
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,360
I heard that you are fond of poetry and calligraphy.

158
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,800
It is said that

159
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,630
when Master Xu passed by the Scholar's Wall,

160
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,680
he also left an inscription on it.

161
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,270
Have you seen it?

162
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:48,540
There are so many inscriptions on the Scholar's Wall.

163
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,470
I didn't notice it.

164
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:58,640
Sir, why do you seem so guarded around me?

165
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,120
Could it be...

166
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,160
I just don't understand

167
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,390
why I didn't notice a girl like you

168
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,950
when you were interested in me.

169
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,310
Your heart wasn't with me,

170
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,230
so of course, you didn't see me.

171
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,510
Now I've noticed you,

172
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,840
but your heart is no longer with me.

173
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,070
Before you came,

174
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,560
I had already visited that restaurant for 7 consecutive days.

175
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,510
I joked with Jiuguang,

176
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,000
saying I was fishing.

177
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,680
During those 7 days,

178
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,750
I thought of several possibilities.

179
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,270
I even thought that the one coming

180
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,680
could be a War Demon

181
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,680
or some kind of warlock from the martial world.

182
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,630
But I never expected

183
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,360
that it would be you—

184
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:49,159
Young Mistress Dai of Yandu City.

185
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,800
How...

186
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,830
How did I know?

187
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,040
You hide your identity but not your name,

188
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,390
so it's easy to inquire about you.

189
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,000
In Yandu City,

190
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,830
your name is well known

191
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,270
even to children.

192
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,870
I'm not your enemy.

193
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:03,720
You are not?

194
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,390
I don't think so.

195
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,480
Back then, when the war first broke out,

196
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,120
my people charged into battle,

197
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,360
while the human race sat back and watched from the sidelines.

198
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,010
I can never forget this grudge.

199
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,310
If it weren't for the War Demons later

200
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:16,310
launching a massive invasion of human cities,

201
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:18,470
burning and killing fiercely

202
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,920
the human race wouldn't have sought an alliance with my people.

203
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:21,720
But our two races

204
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,830
did ally in the end.

205
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:23,870
So what?

206
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,950
If the roles were reversed now,

207
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,510
and the War Demons were the ones

208
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,750
hiding and barely surviving,

209
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,930
what choice would the human race make?

210
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,240
Don't you believe

211
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,960
in moderation and balance the most?

212
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,320
Humans are truly strange.

213
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,909
Though weak,

214
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,440
you still persist and thrive.

215
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,080
When there's no external enemy,

216
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,000
you fight among yourselves,

217
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,000
destroying the peace and prosperity with your own hands.

218
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:48,440
But when an enemy appears,

219
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,320
you can immediately unite

220
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,510
and create extraordinary miracles.

221
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,750
Over the past 60 years,

222
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,200
while the War Demons vanished without a trace,

223
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,520
who has been

224
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,280
holding you together?

225
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,960
Humans are always wavering.

226
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,030
Now that the War Demons are returning,

227
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:05,910
you are wavering again,

228
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,170
aren't you?

229
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,200
So?

230
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:09,720
You suspect my people have colluded

231
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,320
with the remnants of the War Demons, don't you?

232
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,000
Shouldn't I?

233
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,560
If you want to disassociate yourselves from it,

234
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,030
just provide solid proof.

235
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,720
What's the deal with Lyu Yao?

236
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,650
And what about the Green Garden Trading House?

237
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:20,870
And the Wushuang Society?

238
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,150
Can you disassociate yourselves from all of them?

239
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,080
I can.

240
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,320
Trust me.

241
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:26,600
Trust you?

242
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,750
The Young Mistress of Yandu City,

243
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,010
with such noble status,

244
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,840
second only to the emperor,

245
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,080
is undoubtedly

246
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,200
the cream of the crop.

247
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,180
Yet this noble person

248
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,510
willingly went to Fangwai Mountain

249
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:43,180
and became a humble handmaiden,

250
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,440
remaining so for 10 years.

251
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,390
And it was actually

252
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,480
because of me.

253
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,750
Listen to yourself.

254
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,870
Which of these words is believable?

255
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,720
How do you expect me to believe that?

256
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,240
I'm such a fool,

257
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,750
to come here full of guilt

258
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,660
over something like this.

259
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,840
It's truly laughable.

260
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,080
You can suspect

261
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,510
that my people are involved in this matter,

262
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,080
but you cannot doubt

263
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:15,910
my feelings for you

264
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,120
over the past few decades,

265
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,960
even though they no longer exist now.

266
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,030
You're right.

267
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,600
We are indeed good at clever planning.

268
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:27,910
Of course,

269
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,750
in your eyes,

270
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,270
it might just be scheming and trickery.

271
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,670
In my ten years on the mountain,

272
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,600
I've seen enough of your people

273
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,000
fighting to the death over conflicts,

274
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:39,120
and I've also seen

275
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,630
how you've struggled

276
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,060
and strived

277
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,330
in difficult situations.

278
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,510
Tanghua,

279
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,600
with how well I know you and how much attention I've paid to you,

280
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,360
if I wanted to harm you,

281
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:51,970
you would have been dead long ago.

282
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,200
This wine is really good.

283
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,870
I'll drink this again next time.

284
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,120
Of course.

285
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,320
Let me tell you,

286
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,000
I like you this way.

287
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,620
I like you too.

288
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,550
You're different from Master and Zi Fei.

289
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:20,150
They seem to be full of tricks,

290
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:20,600
you know?

291
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,630
Alright, alright, alright.

292
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,000
Jiu, Jiu,

293
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,790
look at me.

294
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:25,090
I've arrived at my place. Go home now.

295
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,750
I'll listen to you.

296
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:28,440
Okay.

297
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,610
Let go of me.

298
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,160
I won't see you off.

299
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,390
I won't see you off.

300
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:34,660
Go back.

301
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,440
I won't see you off.

302
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:38,890
I'll go home.

303
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:40,710
Where's my home again?

304
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,440
It must be the way back.

305
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,430
Over there.

306
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:49,960
Are you totally wasted?

307
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,640
I've been having a bad memory lately.

308
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,650
Oh, my brain.

309
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,720
I even forgot what the Governor looked like

310
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:59,600
when I went to the government office earlier today.

311
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,280
I told you your brain's not working well.

312
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,770
Your brain's not working well!

313
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,960
I'm leaving.

314
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:06,750
Okay.

315
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,630
I won't see you off.

316
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:09,840
Take care.

317
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,480
Alright.

318
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,670
Be careful on your way.

319
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,500
He's drunk.

320
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:26,910
[Yesterday's Inn]

321
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,080
The wine from Lu Chen was really good.

322
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,840
I told you those two

323
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,150
couldn't drink that much.

324
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,110
Wake up.

325
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,720
Is there a person over there?

326
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,080
What person?

327
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,510
Mr. Yuan, are you taking a walk to help with digestion?

328
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:48,850
Ji Tanyin.

329
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,750
Where did you go?

330
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:53,720
I'm going back to my room to sleep.

331
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,480
I'm asking you where you went just now.

332
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,660
Where did I go just now?

333
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,900
My memory hasn't been good lately.

334
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:02,790
Why don't you go ask Zi Fei?

335
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,410
Come with me.

336
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:22,790
It's dark

337
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,120
and cold here,

338
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,480
and there's no one around.

339
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,320
Why are we here?

340
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,910
I always feel that something's off here.

341
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,100
What's off?

342
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,360
Lately, I've been constantly feeling

343
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,360
tightness in my chest.

344
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,320
I suspect

345
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:40,720
it's related to the strange sensation I felt

346
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,120
when I transferred my power to Lu Chen that day.

347
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:43,960
You stay here and keep watch for me,

348
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,200
and I'll go down to investigate.

349
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:52,600

00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:32,600
You definitely don't know her.

378
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,540
♫If between oaths♫

379
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,630
♫I hold onto the longing for just one more glance♫

380
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:39,050
♫Unwilling to bid farewell for good♫

381
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,750
The landlady is getting married.

382
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,590
She's quite busy.

383
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:42,330
♫Tears grow cold in a single cup♫

384
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,320
♫Longing fades in half♫

385

She needs to renovate a house

♫Like flowers in a mirror, or the moon in the water♫

387
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,030
and then make furniture.

388
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:49,480
Once the furniture is done,

389
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:52,630
there will be a lot of things to do.

390
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:57,110
♫A thousand years of long nights, yearning from dawn to dusk♫

391
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,550
Yuanzhong,

let's build a house too.

393
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,190
Yuanzhong,

394
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,300
let's build a house too.

395
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:29,280
Ji Tanyin.

396
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:30,670
Ji Tanyin!

397
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,270
So noisy.

398
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,000
Ji Tanyin, wake up.

399
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,390
Wake up.

400
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,240
I'm telling you,

401
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,670
I will never

402
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:43,720
build a house with you.

403
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,840
Do you understand?

404
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,320
You're just a handmaiden.

405
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,960
I can discard you at any time.

406
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,960
Do you understand?

407
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:06,250
[Yesterday's Inn]

408
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,030
Yuanzhong,

409
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:22,170
let's build a house too.

410
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,160
Madam,

411
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,350
could you pick a necklace for me?

412
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:40,310
I want to give it as a gift.

413
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,270
This one.

414
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,590
Your wife will definitely like it.

415
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:43,440
This one?

416
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:45,110
Look, look at its quality.

417
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:45,830
Madam, how much is this bracelet?

418
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,400
how much is this bracelet?

419
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,590
Please wait a moment.

420
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,560
Captain.

421
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,100
Lyu Yao

422
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:13,310
still isn't here yet?

423
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,030
She always makes us wait

424
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:16,350
for hours.

425
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,510
So arrogant.

426
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:20,560
[Qing Yu]
[War Demon]

427
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:19,960
Once we return to the battlefield,

428
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,920
both she and that Wushuang Society

429
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,750
will have to die.

430
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,510
Things are different now.

431
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:32,130
Qian Lin's whereabouts are unknown,

432
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:33,970
and we are the ones who need her.

433
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,530
We'd better not be so impatient.

434
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,450
Sir, please enjoy.

435
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:43,670
Let me know if you need anything.

436
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,000
Young Master.

437
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,590
We found traces of the War Demons.

438
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,920
Jiuguang has already gone after them.

439
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,340
The stinking fox's scent has disappeared.

440
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:11,950
Who are you calling a stinking fox?

441
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,510
Young Master.

442
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,760
This way.

443
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:28,460
I'll ask you one more time.

444
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,680
How did you escape from the prison?

445
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,400
And what is your relationship with Wushuang Society?

446
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,210
I'll answer you one more time.

447
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,250
I have nothing to tell you.

448
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,480
Don't tell me

449
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:42,690
you're still holding onto some hope.

450
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,000
Let me make it clear.

451
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,270
If you don't confess everything today,

452
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:49,330
you won't be leaving this place.

453
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:51,850
Why waste words?

454
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,960
Are these henchmen of yours just for show?

455
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,680
Just torture me already.

456
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,030
You think we don't dare to do anything to you?

457
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:57,720
Stop.

458
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:01,770
I know you're not afraid of death,

459
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,240
but I advise you

460
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,310
to think it through.

461
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,680
I...

462
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:08,530
will only give you one chance.

463
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,750
Do you know why

464
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,160
I haven't made a move on you yet?

465
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:14,790
Because right now,

466
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,720
it's me standing in front of you.

467
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,640
If it were someone else,

468
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:20,670
you'd already be facing

469
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,170
godlike methods by now.

470
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,400
It's the War Demons.

471
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:33,310
How is it?

472
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,790
They're all inside.

473
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,350
Have you scouted it out thoroughly?

474
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:37,880
We can take action at any time.

475
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,030
Let's go.

476
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:43,930
It looks like

477
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,370
they're going to harm the people in the temple.

478
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,270
It might be a trap.

479
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,270
To prevent any tricks,

480
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,830
let's hold our position for now.

481
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,790
Yes.

482
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,000
Who are you?

483
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,200
Leave the woman.

484
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:00,320
As for the others,

485
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:00,980
kill them!

486
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:15,190
Zhi Dai?

487
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:24,860
Young Master.

488
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,270
It's not about being early but being timely.

489
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,880
Since you're insisting on throwing your life away,

490
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,140
then don't blame me.

491
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:01,100
You knew something was off,

492
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,480
so why did you come in?

493
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,510
You've protected me for many years.

494
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,270
It's time for me to repay you.

495
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:07,040
Master and servant saving each other, huh?

496
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:08,540
What a cheesy scene.

497
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,240
Kill them now!

498
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:31,720
Youhu people?

499
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:34,960
Die!

500
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:10,830
Anyone who stands in my way will die!

501
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:23,020
Young Master!

502
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:26,880
No!

503
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:37,330
Mr. Tanghua!

504
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:38,750
Young Master!

505
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:39,880
Young Master!

506
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:48,070
Tanghua!

507
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:50,960
Retreat!

508
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,660
Young Master!

509
00:23:57,890 --> 00:23:58,690
Tanghua!

510
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,160
Young Master.

511
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,510
Jiuguang...

512
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:05,560
chase them. Chase them!

513
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:10,920
Dying like this

514
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,310
isn't too bad.

515
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,270
You're talking nonsense!

516
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:15,270
Mr. Tanghua.

517
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,720
You won't die!

518
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,070
I won't let you die!

519
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:19,680
Shen Ying, quick!

520
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:21,110
Take my horse and find a cart

521
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:22,500
to bring him back to the mansion for treatment.

522
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:23,460
Yes.

523
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:25,720
Tanghua.

524
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,200
Tanghua.

525
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,070
Yuanzhong, over here.

526
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:19,880
What's going on

527
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,070
this early in the morning?

528
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:23,400
Si.

529
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,960
Why are you so flustered too?

530
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,270
That guy woke up,

531
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:28,790
but he's just staring blankly and not speaking.

532
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:30,200
I'm afraid he might have injured his brain.

533
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:31,630
I need to find a doctor.

534
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,600
You don't even know where you live.

535
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,050
Do you remember who your parents are?

536
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,400
Have you gone dumb?

537
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,070
You remember me, right?

538
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,200
We met once on the tower ship.

539
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,400
You came to ask me for directions.

540
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,480
Do you remember?

541
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:59,920
Did you get injured on the tower ship?

542
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,270
Where are your companions?

543
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,590
What's your name?

544
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,110
He's probably mute.

545
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,750
My name is Qian Lin.

546
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:15,880
My name is Ji Tanyin.

547
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,790
This is San.

548
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:18,200
And there's another one called Si.

549
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,780
They're the ones who saved you and brought you back.

550
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,270
She's the one who paid for your room.

551
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:21,720
Otherwise,

552
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,040
you would've been thrown out already.

553
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:25,350
Look, how kind she is.

554
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:26,590
She even made you a straw mat.

555
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:27,480
She was afraid that if you lay there all the time,

556
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,510
your back would rot.

557
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:29,860
It's nothing.

558
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:30,830
How are you feeling now?

559
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:31,960
You feel better, right?

560
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,960
My things are missing.

561
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,190
Have you seen them?

562
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:41,400
They're with our landlady.

563
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:41,950
When she comes back,

564
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:43,000
you can ask her for them yourself.

565
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,160
Who is it?

566
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,110
Master?

567
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:08,830
It's so early in the morning.

568
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:10,110
What brings you here?

569
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:12,590
I heard you renovated your house.

570
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:16,510
Well, I'm about to get married.

571
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:17,480
So I thought

572
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,030
I'd renovate this old house of mine.

573
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:19,950
Master, look.

574
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,900
That porch, those windows,

575
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:23,030
and the roof—

576
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,410
they're all things I've recently renovated.

577
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,310
Master, let's go inside and have a seat.

578
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,680
Alright.

579
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,070
Master, please come in.

580
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:33,240
Once the new furniture is in place,

581
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,700
this house will look brand new.

582
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,400
Master, please have a seat.

583
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,680
How do you like it?

584
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,480
Not bad.

585
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,790
What's this?

586
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,310
Well, this house

587
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:52,200
just got renovated.

588
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,830
A new house should have a god's image hung up.

589
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,080
This is the image of the Mute Lady of Wu Mountain

590
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,480
I invited here.

591
00:28:58,550 --> 00:28:59,350
Master,

592
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,110
since you're here,

593
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:02,240
could you help me

594
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,160
figure out

595
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,350
where to hang this image?

596
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:05,720
This Mute Lady of Wu Mountain

597
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:09,880
has a lot of things with her.

598
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,240
Master.

599
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:13,640
These are the Mute Goddess's

600
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,720
three magical treasures—

601
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,750
a divine whip that cannot be destroyed,

602
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,510
a phoenix that soars in the sky,

603
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,590
and

604
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:21,350
a treasure bag that can carry all things.

605
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:30,510
Is this the thing you were in a hurry

606
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:31,440
to get back?

607
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,070
Exactly.

608
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:34,270
Thank you, Madam.

609
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:42,150
So sharp.

610
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,750
You tried my dagger?

611
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,510
I meant your eyes.

612
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:48,750
When you were lying down,

613
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:50,180
you looked so gentle and harmless.

614
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:53,230
But now that you've woken up, your eyes are like a drawn sword.

615
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:54,070
Young people,

616
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,720
showing your sharpness and aggressiveness

617
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,400
isn't always a good thing.

618
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,790
Thank you for your advice, Madam.

619
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:03,590
And thank you for taking care of me these days.

620
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,400
Looking after you is not quite right.

621
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,750
After all, I was paid for it.

622
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:08,400
If you really want to thank me,

623
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:09,860
leave here as soon as possible.

624
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,070
I've been in business for a long time,

625
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:13,620
so I've developed a keen eye for people.

626
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,160
I'm never wrong about people.

627
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:18,070
Once you're healed, leave quickly

628
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:18,720
and don't bring trouble

629
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,830
to my inn.

630
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,590
Tanyin.

631
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:33,400
What are you carrying?

632
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:35,640
It's some food for the patient.

633
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,400
Patient?

634
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:37,920
We don't have any patients here.

635
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,110
It's for the person inside.

636
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:41,160
That guy has woken up,

637
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,540
so he's no longer a patient.

638
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:43,920
Aren't you busy today?

639
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,310
It's alright.

640
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,070
Then I'll send...

641
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:47,410
I've told you there's no need to check on him.

642
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:48,590
You're a young girl,

643
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:49,510
and it's not appropriate for you

644
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,510
to keep running to his room.

645
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:51,590
He's recovered now.

646
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,820
Let me see what you've brought.

647
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:56,400
It's all my favorite food.

648
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,350
You are rare here. I'll make some tea,

649
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:59,350
and let's chat for a while.

650
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:00,160
-Let's go.
-Wait...

651
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:01,640
Come on, come on.

652
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:06,690
You asked me to look into

653
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,160
Baitou Mountain, and I've got something.

654
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:09,930
Xie You is quite famous,

655
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,680
which matches what Ji Tanyin said.

656
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:12,720
He once trained two students

657
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,480
with high reputations.

658
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:15,720
One of them is Goddess Wushuang,

659
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,270
who has ascended and is now a god.

660
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:19,400
The other is the Mute Lady of Wu Mountain.

661
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,440
She hasn't ascended,

662
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,200
but her reputation among the human race is also quite high.

663
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,680
She's the one who took your blow

664
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,410
during the Battle of Pinghu.

665
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,070
These are the Mute Goddess's

666
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,210
three magical treasures—

667
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,270
a divine whip that cannot be destroyed,

668
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,030
a phoenix that soars in the sky,

669
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:35,030
and

670
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:36,750
a treasure bag that can carry all things.

671
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,670
Of course it's true.

672
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,270
The doctor said he's recovered.

673
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:46,310
Even if you don't trust me,

674
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:47,400
don't you trust the doctor?

675
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:49,030
Anyway, don't see him anymore.

676
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:49,920
Just listen to me.

677
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,110
Why can't I see him?

678
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,170
Anyway...

679
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,720
Mr. Yuan, you're back?

680
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,960
Where have you been?

681
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:04,830
Just wandered around.

682
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:09,200
That painting...

683
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,090
What about it?

684
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:16,160
I saw a similar one at Pei Jiu's house.

685
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:18,030
The portrait of the Mute Goddess

686
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,320
was also invited here by me,

687
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,880
to pray for Pei Jiu's safety.

688
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,790
It seems that the people in this town

689
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:26,760
all believe in the Mute Lady of Wu Mountain.

690
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,640
Of course.

691
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:30,480
When you entered the town,

692
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:32,150
didn't you see the stone at the entrance?

693
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:33,110
What?

694
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,240
This big,

695
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,440
and this tall.

696
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:37,780
Maybe even taller.

697
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,110
It's right at the entrance, with the words "Turn Back" written on it.

698
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,550
Did you not see the Evil-abandoning Tree

699
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:43,480
in the east of the town as well?

700
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,630
Does it have words written on it too?

701
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,270
Well, no.

702
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,330
Anyway,

703
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,680
it's a very large tree.

704
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,790
It's said that, back then,

705
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:51,200
37 people sat under that tree,

706
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,880
and none of them

707
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,160
were outside the shade.

708
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,620
Can you imagine how big the tree is?

709
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:58,070
Madam, what exactly are you trying to say?

710
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,750
I won't keep you guessing.

711
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,770
What I'm telling you is not just the history of this town,

712
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,120
but also its connection

713
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,620
to the Mute Lady of Wu Mountain.

714
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,680
Originally,

715
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,680
this place was a bandit den,

716
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,640
called Black Water Stronghold.

717
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:10,510
As you know, bandits are notorious

718
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:11,550
for doing all kinds of evil

719
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:12,640
and wreaking havoc everywhere.

720
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:13,480
The surrounding villagers

721
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,270
had suffered from them for many years.

722
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:16,230
But these bandits

723
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,240
were highly skilled.

724
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:18,070
Each of the chiefs

725
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:19,070
possessed extraordinary abilities

726
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,070
and was ruthless.

727
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:21,480
For a time,

728
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,350
even the authorities had no idea how to deal with them.

729
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:24,310
And then?

730
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:27,160
Then, the Mute Goddess of Wu Mountain

731
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,160
stepped in.

732
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,000
Upon learning about the bandit problem here,

733
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:31,550
she came without hesitation

734
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:32,720
to enlighten them.

735
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:34,160
Enlighten?

736
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,790
There are two kinds of enlightenment—

737
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:37,680
one through kindness, and the other through force.

738
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:38,550
Kindness

739
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:39,830
works on good people,

740
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:40,590
but when facing

741
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:42,160
evil people who refuse to listen,

742
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,200
it all comes down to

743
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,790
whose fist is stronger.

744
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,700
So that's what you call enlightening through force.

745
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,720
Exactly. It's said that

746
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,200
the Goddess beat them terribly back then.

747
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:50,880
Not only that,

748
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,160
but she dragged them under the tree and lectured them

749
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,680
for three days and three nights

750
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,070
until all 36 chiefs

751
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:56,880
were fully convinced.

752
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:59,550
She didn't just defeat them physically—she broke their spirits too?

753
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:01,110
The Mute Goddess

754
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:04,030
is truly ruthless.

755
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:04,830
How else

756
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:06,270
can you deal with evildoers without being ruthless?

757
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:07,780
After that,

758
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,320
the Black Water Stronghold disbanded—

759
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,030
some left,

760
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:11,030
while some stayed.

761
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:11,480
But

762
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,800
no one committed crimes anymore.

763
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,880
They settled down, married,

764
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,480
and lived peaceful lives ever after.

765
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,110
To remember this event

766
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:18,070
and serve as a warning to future generations,

767
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:19,030
they erected the Turning Back Stone

768
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:20,280
at the town entrance,

769
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,030
symbolizing that it's never too late

770
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:23,280
for a lost soul to turn back.

771
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:26,000
This event happened hundreds of years ago.

772
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,550
People come and go in this town,

773
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:29,070
and the name "Black Water Stronghold"

774
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,480
is almost forgotten by everyone.

775
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,590
Only that stone remains,

776
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:32,840
standing there without budging.

777
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:35,150
Isn't that a clear testament

778
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:36,710
to the Goddess' achievements?

779
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:40,600
It certainly is,

780
00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:42,600
and it's very obvious.

781
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:45,630
Even I didn't notice it.

782
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:48,280
That's why it's only natural

783
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,480
that we honor the Goddess.

784
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:51,000
You've only seen a few households.

785
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,110
If you're curious,

786
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:53,159
you can go from house to house,

787
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:54,620
and you can see that every family worships the Goddess.

788
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,110
Is that so?

789
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,800
Looks like the Mute Goddess

790
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,670
is truly a celestial being who descended to the world

791
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:03,210
to save all beings.

792
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:04,920
Ji Tanyin,

793
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:07,440
what do you think?

794
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:13,480
Since that's the case,

795
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,320
we absolutely must not

796
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,590
be disrespectful.

797
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,630
Madam,

798
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:21,030
could you sell me some incense?

799
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,510
I'd like to pay my respects too.

800
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:23,800
Oh, don't be silly.

801
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,440
I don't make money from just anything.

802
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:26,720
If you want to pay respects to the Goddess,

803
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,320
I can't possibly take your money.

804
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,960
Please, go ahead.

805
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:50,960
Mute Goddess,

806
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,590
I, a mere mortal, Yuanzhong,

807
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,130
am offering incense to you

808
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,280
and praying for your blessings.

809
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,360
Remember to pray for wealth.

810
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,670
Praying for wealth is very effective.

811
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,400
First, I pray for your protection over me,

812
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:09,480
to discern loyalty and treachery

813
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:11,880
when making friends,

814
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,880
and not to be deceived by false hypocrites.

815
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,630
Second, I pray for you to bless me

816
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:28,000
with a smooth path in life,

817
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:29,580
allowing me to come and go freely,

818
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:34,000
and to be free from the traps of hypocrisy and deceit.

819
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:39,150
Third, I pray for you to bless me

820
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,150
with good fortune,

821
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:43,030
to avoid disasters,

822
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:46,630
and to keep me safe from all my old and new enemies and foes

823
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,440
with honeyed words but evil intentions.

824
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,070
Goddess, may you show your divine power.

825
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:31,280
I am severely injured now

826
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,510
and definitely no match for them.

827
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,400
If I want to make it,

828
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:37,700
I need to wait for the right moment and use wisdom to win.

829
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:05,400
I, Li Chaoyang, Chief of the War Demons,

830
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,710
greet you, Goddess.

831
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,630
Let me ask you,

832
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:11,800
have the things I entrusted to you

833
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,960
been fully prepared?

834
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:17,550
Goddess,

835
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:19,480
everything has been prepared

836
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,480
according to your instructions,

837
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,880
without any mistakes.

838
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:30,960
Ji Tanyin is her real name.

839
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:33,360
Her birth date is on the paper.

840
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:35,760
Tomorrow is her birthday.

841
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:38,070
There must be no mistakes.

842
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:39,190
Yes.

843
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,630
Yuanzhong.

844
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,230
Yuanzhong?

845
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:50,150
I made noodles.

846
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:51,400
Come out and eat with me.

847
00:38:58,710 --> 00:38:59,510
What's wrong?

848
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,070
I came to call Yuanzhong for noodles,

849
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:02,230
but he's not opening the door.

850
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:03,760
He must have gone out.

851
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,320
But I didn't see him leave.

852
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,400
Go and have some rest.

853
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,200
I'll go find him.

854
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,280
Yuanzhong, it's me.

855
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,030
I knew you were here.

856
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:31,150
Why didn't you open the door?

857
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:31,960
I have no appetite.

858
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:32,680
I'm not hungry.

859
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:34,760
Not hungry?

860
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:37,920
Is there a big secret

861
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,190
that you can only tell me?

862
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:42,230
From now on,

863
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,360
everything about me

864
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,320
is a secret,

865
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:46,010
especially to Ji Tanyin.

866
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,360
Why?

867
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:47,880
Haven't we already known

868
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,360
that something's wrong with her?

869
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:51,670
But hasn't she already...

870
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:53,070
She's the Mute Lady of Wu Mountain.

871
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:54,400
What?

872
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,110
How is that possible?

873
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:57,070
Are you shocked?

874
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:58,610
I was even more shocked than you are.

875
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,360
I originally thought she was just...

876
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:02,510
I knew there was something wrong with her.

877
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,360
I knew she had ulterior motives.

878
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,590
I knew her deliberately approaching

879
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:06,880
was certainly not with good intentions!

880
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:08,150
I should have realized it earlier.

881
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:09,110
I should have thought of it.

882
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:10,330
I should have awakened to it sooner!

883
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:11,440
Yuanzhong,

884
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,480
there's no need to be so agitated.

885
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:15,510
Am I agitated?

886
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:16,230
Which one of your eyes

887
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:17,110
saw me being agitated?

888
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:18,150
I'm happy.

889
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:19,590
I can't be happy enough.

890
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:20,940
Now that we've exposed her,

891
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:22,320
what should we do next?

892
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:24,920
Indeed,

893
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:26,400
I don't know why

894
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,400
Ji Tanyin appeared

895
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,840
by your side either,

896
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:30,550
but we've been with her for so long—

897
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,150
from Fangwai Mountain to the tower ship,

898
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,440
to Baitou Mountain,

899
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,440
and now to Orange Lake.

900
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,760
It's been quite a journey.

901
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,710
I don't think she has any ill intentions.

902
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:43,320
At least,

903
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,970
she's genuinely been protecting you.

904
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,280
However,

905
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,760
whether she's good or bad,

906
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,840
and no matter what her intentions are,

907
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,800
I feel that

908
00:40:58,190 --> 00:40:59,070
she is no longer suitable

909
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:00,320
to stay by your side.

910
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:01,960
Because

911
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,110
she will disturb your mind,

912
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,230
or perhaps,

913
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,030
she already has.

914
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,320
Yuanzhong, this can't go on.

915
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,190
She will interfere

916
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:13,880
with what we need to do next.

917
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,670
Miss Ji.

918
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:35,590
Have your injuries healed?

919
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:37,800
Thank you for your concern.

920
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:38,860
It's no longer a problem.

921
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:43,550
What are you doing?

922
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,840
I'm making a cabinet.

923
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:47,360
The landlady is getting married.

924
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,230
It's a gift for her.

925
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:50,840
Miss, you're really kind.

926
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,110
We're friends, after all.

927
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:53,030
Friends?

928
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:54,760
I thought

929
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,630
you were just guests at the inn.

930
00:41:58,110 --> 00:41:59,110
Can't a guest and the owner

931
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:00,430
be friends?

932
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,320
Of course they can.

933
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:05,230
It's just that most people come and go in a hurry,

934
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:06,230
just passing by,

935
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:07,800
making it hard to make true friends.

936
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:11,440
Miss Ji,

937
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,920
are you planning to stay here for a long time?

938
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,000
Why did you come here?

939
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:17,190
Are you here visiting family and friends...

940
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:19,230
or just traveling?

941
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,920
Miss, please don't get me wrong.

942
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:25,260
The reason I asked

943
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:27,930
is because you've covered

944
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:28,910
many of my expenses.

945
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:30,800
I don't have any money at the moment,

946
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:32,470
and I thought if you're planning to stay here for a long time,

947
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:34,280
it would be easier for me to pay you back.

948
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:35,490
Is that the reason?

949
00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:39,170
It's fine. You don't need to pay me back.

950
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:40,070
How could I?

951
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,670
Yuanzhong is very wealthy.

952
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:42,960
Using his money to help you

953
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:44,360
would probably make him happy too.
