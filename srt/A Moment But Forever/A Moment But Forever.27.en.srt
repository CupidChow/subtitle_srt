[A Moment But Forever]

00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,240
[Episode 27]

3
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,230
Yuanzhong.

4
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,200
Yuanzhong.

5
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:05,760
Yuanzhong!

6
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,280
Where are you?

7
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,630
Yuanzhong!

8
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,120
Yuanzhong!

9
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:21,340
Yuanzhong.

10
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,000
Yuanzhong.

11
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:27,430
Yuanzhong.

12
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,590
Yuanzhong!

13
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,520
Left... A little more to the left.

14
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,840
A little more to the left.

15
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,430
Be careful.

16
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:20,840
Tanyin!

17
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,430
You're awake.

18
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,680
What are you guys doing?

19
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,190
We're fixing the window frame.

20
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,910
Good morning, Ji Tanyin.

21
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,079
Tanyin.

22
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,030
Do you know that

23
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,750
you nearly scared me to death that day?

24
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,910
You were completely motionless.

25
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:42,310
The doctor said you were dead

26
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:42,840
and insisted that we

27
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,120
go find a coffin shop.

28
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,120
I was so angry

29
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,520
that I scolded him and drove him away.

30
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,710
He said he would

31
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:48,890
never treat us again.

32
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,190
Who needs him to treat us anyway?

33
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,190
Sorry.

34
00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:54,040
I made you worry.

35
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,470
Tanyin.

36
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,750
I never believed you would die.

37
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,680
How could such a nice

38
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,680
and healthy person

39
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,870
possibly die like that?

40
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,250
I wanted to go find another doctor,

41
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:04,560
but they wouldn't let me.

42
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,710
I'm really fine.

43
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:09,220
I just...

44
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,590
I just held my breath for a while.

45
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:15,430
Was it breath-holding?

46
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,920
How dangerous that was.

47
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,560
What if something really happens next time?

48
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:20,800
I promise you

49
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,190
it won't happen again.

50
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,270
That's more like it.

51
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,240
You...

52
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:25,800
By the way,

53
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,270
what's Qian Lin doing?

54
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:28,740
Why don't you go check on him?

55
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:29,750
Qian Lin?

56
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,960
Why should I check on him?

57
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:38,000
I suddenly have a craving for sugar cake.

58
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,710
With sesame stuffing.

59
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,460
Could you go buy some for me?

60
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,600
Now?

61
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,890
Looks like someone has something

62
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,070
to say in private.

63
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,240
Alright.

64
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,920
Then I'll go buy the sugar cake.

65
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:57,970
Sesame sugar cake, date sugar cake,

66
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,909
sugarcane sugar cake,

67
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,430
or whatever sugar cake, I guess.

68
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,120
I have something to tell you.

69
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,270
Go ahead.

70
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:11,240
Before,

71
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,070
I doubted you

72
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,310
and tested you.

73
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:16,950
That was all my fault.

74
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,720
I argued with you

75
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,430
and even raised my hand against you.

76
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,310
It was a terrible mistake.

77
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,160
From now on, I won't do it again.

78
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,920
Can you forgive me?

79
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,159
Ji Tanyin.

80
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,020
Something big happened that night.

81
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,190
What happened?

82
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,920
Do you remember

83
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,870
the places you said you wanted to go?

84
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:44,920
You said

85
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,680
you wanted to go

86
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,070
to those places with me.

87
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,430
That travel journal

88
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,070
was accidentally burned by me.

89
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,870
But I've transcribed them all

90
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:56,920
based on my memory

91
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,240
and what you said.

92
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:58,950
I'll read it to you,

93
00:05:58,950 --> 00:05:59,830
and you can check if it's complete.

94
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:00,960
Sure.

95
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,240
"I was to the east of Tanlu Pavilion,

96
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:11,600
gazing at Chizhou,

97
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,270
delighted by the sight.

98
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,870
We crossed Di River and Wan Creek.

99
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,190
After passing through some lonely lands,

100
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,720
we drank sweet wine aplenty.

101
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,360
I reached the summit of the high mountain

102
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,750
and the source of the river.

103
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,510
Only then did I rest."

104
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:27,940
Yes, it did contain these.

105
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,040
You said

106
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,510
there was a poet

107
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:32,950
who once, by chance,

108
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:35,240
arrived at the scenic spots of Chizhou.

109
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,920
So he crossed the Xiao River,

110
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,190
reached the peak of West Mountain,

111
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,950
and beheld the breathtaking landscape.

112
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,360
He experienced the charm of mountains and waters,

113
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,680
and achieved a state of unity with nature.

114
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,390
And there's this one.

115
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,630
This is about local customs.

116
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,120
They have a custom of drinking on ice beds.

117
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,560
"It's rare to find travelers here,

118
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:57,950
enjoying themselves so much that they forget to return.

119
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:59,360
People feast and drink,

120
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,070
singing loudly on the ice beds,

121
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,680
reciting poetry and drinking,

122
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:03,940
with snow as their companion,

123
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,120
in perfect harmony."

124
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:09,360
You also mentioned a place

125
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,480
where many years ago,

126
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,360
an unusual natural phenomenon appeared.

127
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:13,950
In the long night,

128
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,830
a beam of five-colored light appeared,

129
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,430
resembling a dragon or a snake,

130
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,830
and the whole space was lit up.

131
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,120
It didn't go away until half a month later.

132
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,480
The sky there

133
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,190
has been colorful ever since.

134
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:25,920
How was it?

135
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,300
Did I cover everything?

136
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,680
Is there anything I missed?

137
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,430
No.

138
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:38,870
Ji Tanyin.

139
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,630
I'm giving you an answer seriously now.

140
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,120
I want to go with you

141
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,720
to the places recorded in the notebook,

142
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:49,190
and the places that haven't been recorded.

143
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,390
Everything that's interesting,

144
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,870
unknown,

145
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,950
unseen,

146
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,870
and worth experiencing,

147
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,230
I want to experience them all with you.

148
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,560
I hope we can take our time and experience them together.

149
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,070
Yuanzhong.

150
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,480
Thank you for your hard work.

151
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:15,890
Writing a few words

152
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:17,810
isn't hard at all.

153
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,720
Taihe's divine body has disintegrated.

154
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:02,980
I'm powerless to reverse the situation.

155
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,720
Only this map

156
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,220
can keep you barely alive,

157
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,890
temporarily preventing you from dissolving into the universe.

158
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:10,120
What on earth happened?

159
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,200
Why did Taihe's divine body

160
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,470
suddenly collapse?

161
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,030
Because the other me

162
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,370
is about to cease to exist.

163
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,420
The other you?

164
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:18,600
What do you mean?

165
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,360
During the war between gods and demons,

166
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:21,440
Taihe and I

167
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,150
fought to the very last moment.

168
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,320
We were both about to perish in the universe.

169
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:27,480
My body was completely shattered,

170
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:29,570
and Taihe's primordial spirit was also dispersed.

171
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,910
I took the opportunity to enter Taihe's body,

172
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,880
intending to possess his body.

173
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:36,380
So Taihe cut off his left hand?

174
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:37,490
Yes.

175
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,840
In order to

176
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,320
prevent me from invading and possessing him,

177
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,670
Taihe recklessly

178
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,240
cut off the Divine Left Hand

179
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,480
and threw it into the mortal realm,

180
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,420
splitting my primordial spirit in two.

181
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,370
He also severed the celestial ladder.

182
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,080
Since then, my primordial spirit has been incomplete.

183
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,620
Half of it fell into the mortal realm,

184
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:55,800
while the other half barely survived in the Divine Realm.

185
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,360
I couldn't be reborn.

186
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,590
I could only lie dormant in this body,

187
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,980
waiting for the right moment

188
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,720
to make my move again.

189
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,200
I know all of this that you've said.

190
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,960
But for all these years,

191
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,000
Taihe's divine body

192
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,150
has remained intact.

193
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,550
Why has it been showing frequent anomalies recently,

194
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,840
until it completely disappeared

195
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,840
into the Luofu Sea?

196
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,600
Because Yuanzhong's inner malice

197
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,600
has been decreasing.

198
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,760
It's becoming less and less.

199
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,200
The Divine Left Hand has been lost in the Mortal Realm for years

200
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,390
and has been severely damaged.

201
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,790
That half of my primordial spirit

202
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,150
has become very weak

203
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,910
and needs to feed on human malice.

204
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,000
The High Priest of the Youhu Clan

205
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,360
was indeed the most resentful and world-weary person

206
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,480
in this universe in the past,

207
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,000
with the strongest malice.

208
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,320
But now,

209
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,330
his malice is becoming less and less.

210
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,760
When he truly becomes wholeheartedly good,

211
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,420
that other half of my primordial spirit

212
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,000
will completely disappear.

213
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,750
I will cease to exist as well.

214
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,530
Our grand plan

215
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:47,250
will be impossible to complete.

216
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:49,720
We must kill him immediately.

217
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,870
Hannv.

218
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,840
Go and retrieve the Divine Left Hand.

219
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,230
We can't wait any longer.

220
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,370
[City Lord's Mansion]

221
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,080
Hushan ginseng

222
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,790
is considered a specialty of Fangwai Mountain.

223
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,030
It has the remarkable effect of nourishing blood and replenishing qi,

224
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,480
as well as benefiting yin and strengthening bones.

225
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,000
Please kindly accept this, Young Mistress Dai.

226
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:16,200
I've never seen

227
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,600
such a big Hushan ginseng before.

228
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,240
Why are you presenting such a valuable gift?

229
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,790
Since Mr. Tanghua got injured,

230
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,360
he's been taken care of here at the City Lord's Mansion.

231
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,510
Countless precious medicinal herbs

232
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:26,790
like this must have been used.

233
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,360
I am merely acting on behalf of the Elders of our clan

234
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,630
to present this humble gift

235
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,030
as a token of our appreciation.

236
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,390
You should take it back.

237
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,750
He was injured while saving me

238
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:40,480
by those vicious War Demons.

239
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,080
Treating him at my mansion

240
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,480
is only right and proper.

241
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:44,750
I'm already grateful that the Youhu Clan

242
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,200
hasn't blamed me for this.

243
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,200
How could I

244
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,200
be so shameless

245
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,390
as to accept a thank-you gift?

246
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,150
Although what you said might be true,

247
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,270
if you

248
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:55,030
insist on not accepting this,

249
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,480
when I return,

250
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,360
I'm afraid I won't be able to explain to the Elders.

251
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,150
I've made up my mind.

252
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,270
I absolutely cannot accept it.

253
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,000
Please, Young Mistress Dai,

254
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,320
don't put me in a difficult position.

255
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,310
It's you who shouldn't be putting me in a difficult position.

256
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,360
What's so difficult?

257
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:14,600
Greetings, Young Master.

258
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,790
Young Master.

259
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,750
Jiuguang.

260
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,240
It's been a few days since I last saw you.

261
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,730
You seem to have lost quite some weight.

262
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:22,740
Really?

263
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,600
But your complexion, Young Master,

264
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,560
has improved a lot.

265
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:29,910
Thanks to Miss Zhi Dai's

266
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:30,790
attentive care,

267
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:33,200
I feel my injuries are almost healed.

268
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,440
I, Jiuguang, want to thank you again, Young Mistress Dai.

269
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,840
There's no need for such formalities.

270
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,550
Speaking of which,

271
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,630
the Elders of our clan asked me

272
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:46,080
to bring a small gift.

273
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,960
But Young Mistress Dai

274
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,510
is reluctant to accept it.

275
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,030
Is that so?

276
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,240
We lack nothing at our mansion.

277
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,790
I've already appreciated your kind gesture.

278
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,080
This...

279
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,870
You two, master and servant, haven't seen each other for days.

280
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:02,840
Have a good chat.

281
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,910
I still have some matters to attend to,

282
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,080
so I'll take my leave now.

283
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,380
Yuying, come with me for a walk.

284
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:09,900
Yes.

285
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,440
Did you tell the Elders

286
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,080
about my injury?

287
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,270
Of course not.

288
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,720
Without your approval, Young Master,

289
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,270
how could I send any message at will?

290
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:28,870
Then this ginseng...

291
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:30,900
If it weren't for this,

292
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:32,600
how would the two of us

293
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:35,000
have had the chance to be alone like this?

294
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,720
Have you perhaps discovered something?

295
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,200
You should go and help Xue.

296
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:47,390
Alright.

297
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:48,160
Then you sit for a while.

298
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:54,450
Was it him who hurt you?

299
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:55,510
No, it wasn't.

300
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:57,030
I know he's been possessed.

301
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,360
I can see it.

302
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,720
What do you think you've seen?

303
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,930
Stop talking nonsense.

304
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,670
Your magic source has been destroyed.

305
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:03,670
If he hears you,

306
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:05,150
you won't be able to beat him later.

307
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:07,270
He couldn't beat me even before his magic source was destroyed.

308
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,750
Your magic source got destroyed?

309
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:12,970
By whom?

310
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:16,860
Me?

311
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,390
When was that?

312
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,120
How come I don't remember?

313
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:20,960
You...

314
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,870
Alright, alright.

315
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:22,910
Let's eat.

316
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:23,750
Stop talking.

317
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:29,670
It's a feast, isn't it?

318
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:30,530
Come on.

319
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,720
I'm exhausted.

320
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,480
Today is truly a great day.

321
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,040
Is this all?

322
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:43,360
Where's the wine?

323
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Tanyin is sick,

324
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,510
so we'll skip the wine today.

325
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:47,870
We'll have soup instead.

326
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:49,600
Let's all raise our bowls

327
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,510
to celebrate.

328
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,000
What are we celebrating?

329
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:55,840
Celebrating that Tanyin has woken up,

330
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,910
and that the High Priest of the Youhu Clan

331
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,100
has come to visit our home.

332
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,320
Come on, Tanyin, try this.

333
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,120
See if it's good.

334
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:12,600
Here.

335
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,230
High Priest.

336
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,120
Do you like

337
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,030
our Tanyin?

338
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,790
How did you figure that out?

339
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,670
Do you even need to ask?

340
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:33,910
Isn't it obvious?

341
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,150
Did you have a fight

342
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,570
with Tanyin a few days ago?

343
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,630
Don't fight anymore in the future.

344
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:45,510
We, as her family, won't allow it.

345
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:46,260
Okay.

346
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:47,750
I promise you.

347
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,390
Good.

348
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:50,210
Let's have another drink then.

349
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:50,910
Alright.

350
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,070
Come on.

351
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:58,480
Tanyin.

352
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,630
If the High Priest wants to take care of you,

353
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,750
does that mean he'll live here, too?

354
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:05,680
I can live here.

355
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,400
It's just,

356
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:07,349
which room should I stay in?

357
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:08,579
You can stay in Qian Lin's room.

358
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:09,780
Qian Lin can stay in the woodshed.

359
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:12,440
I'll go, okay?

360
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,270
I'll stay in the woodshed.

361
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,109
Calm down.

362
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:14,720
Sit down, sit down.

363
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,589
Don't be angry.

364
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:16,920
I'll punish myself with a drink, okay?

365
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,750
I'll drink as punishment.

366
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,240
Peace is really good.

367
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,730
You see,

368
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,070
as long as everyone can sit down

369
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,110
and have a meal together,

370
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,640
there's nothing that can't be resolved.

371
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,160
Whether it's the Youhu Clan,

372
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,830
the War Demon, or the human race,

373
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,070
we can all get along, right?

374
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,790
Well said.

375
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,830
It's worth having another bowl.

376
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,160
Come on, let's have another bowl.

377
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:43,920
Cheers.

378
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,550
Cheers.

379
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,110
This War Demon here had his magic source destroyed,

380
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:01,460
yet he's still got quite an appetite.

381
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,240
Is it because the stomach and the magic source

382
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,310
are far apart in your body?

383
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,000
Alright, alright.

384
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,310
It's such a good day today.

385
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,400
Let's have a good time, shall we?

386
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,030
Come on, come on.

387
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:09,680
Cheers.

388
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:11,400
Right, let's have another drink.

389
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:12,880
To our reunion.

390
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,790
Year after year.

391
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:14,600
Year after year.

392
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:15,160
Cheers.

393
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,440
Cheers.

394
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,200
That's right. That's the spirit.

395
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,630
♫The wind blows♫

396
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,420
♫It blows away the shadows of the clouds♫

397
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,110
♫It makes the moon seem even brighter♫

398
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:38,320
♫It makes me wake up from a dream♫

399
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,570
♫The wind blows♫

400
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,190
♫It reddens my eyes♫

401
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:43,210
♫It warms the promise we made♫

402
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,850
♫In the wind, we gently♫

403
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:50,650
♫Drift into a better place♫

404
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:00,920
Young Mistress.

405
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,790
What did the doctor say?

406
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:04,880
Young Mistress.

407
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,750
The doctor said he has fully recovered

408
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,200
and can leave at any time.

409
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,720
However,

410
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,880
Mr. Tanghua just told me

411
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,110
he plans to stay for another day or two before leaving.

412
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:14,930
He said there's no rush.

413
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
One more person in the mansion won't make a difference.

414
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,200
It's fine if he stays for a couple more days.

415
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,320
Yes.

416
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:38,840
Stay for another day or two...

417
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,640
I noticed you didn't eat much

418
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,680
at dinner.

419
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,550
I've cut some fruit for you.

420
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:55,680
Here.

421
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,440
I didn't eat much

422
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,550
all because of you.

423
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:03,480
Couldn't you have said

424
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,750
a bit less to Qian Lin?

425
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,030
He's already been through

426
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:06,920
so much.

427
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,000
He's not in a good mood,

428
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,480
and he doesn't know how to express himself well.

429
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:11,970
You're not worried about me talking to him.

430
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,990
You're just worried I might lecture him, right?

431
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:15,270
Can't you just

432
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,440
do it for my sake?

433
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,560
Alright.

434
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:23,290
What are you doing?

435
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,790
I'm carefully observing what "your sake" looks like.

436
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,400
Alright, alright.

437
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,830
I- I got it.

438
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,210
Here, have another one.

439
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,170
Days like this are really nice.

440
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,000
Ji Tanyin.

441
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:02,910
You'll always be by my side, right?

442
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,440
Now that

443
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:03,880
we've created the perfect War Demon,

444
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:08,190
it's time for the High Priest of the Youhu Clan

445
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:10,310
to pay for his crimes in blood.

446
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,720
It's me.

447
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,680
Tanghua?

448
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:24,960
What are you doing here?

449
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:26,630
This is not the place for a detailed conversation.

450
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,610
Let's talk after we get back.

451
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:29,130
Cut the crap.

452
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,600
If you don't talk, I'll shout for help.

453
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,510
Go ahead and shout.

454
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,720
This is Zhi Yue's study.

455
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,720
It's highly confidential.

456
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,350
Do you know what will happen if I call for someone?

457
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:39,480
If you call for someone,

458
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,550
it's not just me,

459
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,750
you'll be in danger too.

460
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,680
Trust me this once.

461
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,300
I won't harm you.

462
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,160
As expected.

463
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,640
[Wushuang Society]

464
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,750
Do you understand now?

465
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,720
There's no need for me to explain, is there?

466
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,350
You'd better explain anyway.

467
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,200
The reason I conducted a night investigation

468
00:24:58,510 --> 00:24:59,310
was because I received

469
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,400
a tip from Jiuguang.

470
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:03,030
In his pursuit of the cause of Lyu Yao's death,

471
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,200
he had been closely monitoring the Green Garden Trading House.

472
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:07,160
Following the trail,

473
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:08,240
he rescued someone

474
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,790
who was nearly silenced.

475
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,750
That person mentioned a token,

476
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,550
and the origin of this token

477
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,590
pointed to the City Lord's Mansion.

478
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:18,400
So when you said you wanted to stay for a couple more days,

479
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,440
it was to find this token?

480
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:21,550
Yes.

481
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:23,440
I wasn't sure before

482
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,510
if I could find it in one attempt.

483
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,000
Unexpectedly, my luck was quite good.

484
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,960
Now, with concrete evidence in hand,

485
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:33,160
it seems that the murderer who killed Lyu Yao

486
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,350
and the mastermind behind

487
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:35,750
the Wushuang Society

488
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:38,030
are both your brother.

489
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:47,440
The Wushuang Society has been deeply embedded in Yandu for a long time.

490
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,510
This organization acts radically,

491
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:51,590
viewing the Youhu Clan as their enemy

492
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,440
and the War Demon Clan as their friend.

493
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,830
They secretly support the Green Garden Trading House

494
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:57,070
among many other trading houses

495
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:58,480
to trade with War Demons.

496
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:01,110
Not just raw stones,

497
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,680
but also large quantities of daily supplies are involved.

498
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:05,110
It can be said that they have been consistently supporting

499
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,790
War Demons, keeping them alive despite setbacks.

500
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:09,830
It's like a malignant tumor

501
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:10,960
that stirs up chaos in this world.

502
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,880
I just never imagined

503
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:18,590
that this tumor would actually grow in the heart of Yandu,

504
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,590
right here in the City Lord's Mansion.

505
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,640
Isn't it too hasty to conclude

506
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,240
that Zhi Yue is the mastermind

507
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,720
based solely on this item?

508
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,640
Given his status,

509
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:31,240
how could he be subordinate to others?

510
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,550
If he is part of the Wushuang Society,

511
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:35,270
he must be the leader of evil.

512
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:37,070
What if he's not

513
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:38,270
a member of the Wushuang Society?

514
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,480
Although this item was found in his possession,

515
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,480
it doesn't prove that it belongs to him.

516
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,510
Perhaps Zhi Yue is also investigating this matter,

517
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:46,640
and the token

518
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,240
is evidence he found during his search?

519
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,920
Do you even believe what you said yourself?

520
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,160
Alright.

521
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,490
This is a serious issue.

522
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,510
I know it's hard for you to accept right now.

523
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:03,350
I'll give you time.

524
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,960
I'll leave the City Lord's Mansion right away.

525
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:09,350
I'll give you three days to think it over,

526
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,800
and I won't report this to the clan for now.

527
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,550
In three days,

528
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:17,070
we'll discuss this matter together again.

529
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:20,110
I hope by then, you'll come to your senses

530
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,760
and no longer show bias towards him.

531
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,120
As for this tumor,

532
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,830
we of the Youhu Clan must

533
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,030
remove it at all costs.

534
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,920
Ji Tanyin considers you a friend.

535
00:27:58,270 --> 00:27:59,360
Even if you're leaving,

536
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:00,240
you should

537
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,590
at least have said goodbye to her.

538
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,880
It's none of your business.

539
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,070
I owe her,

540
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,160
but I don't owe you anything.

541
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,240
Don't push me too far.

542
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:16,260
So what if I do?

543
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:25,920
Times have changed.

544
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:27,200
If you get hurt now,

545
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,100
it won't be so easy to recover.

546
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,350
I know about you.

547
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:31,400
You're a demon.

548
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:32,780
You can't fool me,

549
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:34,070
and you certainly can't fool her!

550
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,510
Then tell me,

551
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:38,960
what do you think I plan to do by getting close to her?

552
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:41,030
Or let me rephrase,

553
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:43,350
even if I deceive her and harm her,

554
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,950
what can you do about it?

555
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:46,880
I'll fight you to the death if I have to!

556
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,750
They say War Demons are naturally combative.

557
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:52,880
It seems to be true in your case.

558
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,030
But with your magic source destroyed,

559
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,750
how do you plan to fight me to the death?

560
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,510
I'll bite you to death if I have to!

561
00:28:58,830 --> 00:28:59,640
Is that so?

562
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:27,770
Seems your teeth aren't very sharp.

563
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,240
You're asking for death!

564
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:40,960
You used such dirty tricks!

565
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:43,030
You scoundrel! You lowlife!

566
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:43,750
Let go!

567
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,710
You...

568
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,200
What are you doing?

569
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:00,000
I'm watching you play dumb.

570
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,550
Do you really not know

571
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:02,750
what I'm doing?

572
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:05,110
Why are you helping me?

573
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:06,750
Reach the utmost emptiness,

574
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,680
and maintain unwavering tranquility.

575
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,440
Let the mind dwell on nothing,

576
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,160
and the breath flow naturally.

577
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,550
Only then can your skills flow endlessly.

578
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,750
You still haven't answered.

579
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,270
Why are you helping me?

580
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,070
Because you're lucky.

581
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:25,070
I don't like you,

582
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:26,830
but she does.

583
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:29,400
That's your luck.

584
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:39,590
By the way,

585
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:41,660
when I get to Xue's house tomorrow,

586
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:43,440
I'll expect you there.

587
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:44,830
Otherwise...

588
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:57,790
Mr. Loong.

589
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,270
Mr. Loong.

590
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:31,580
What exactly happened?

591
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,960
Could it be that Hannv

592
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,240
has closed the Ascension Platform?

593
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,200
Then I

594
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:38,030
won't be able to ascend to heaven, will I?

595
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:01,790
Tanyin.

596
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:05,790
Good morning.

597
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,110
You're up so early today.

598
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,350
I've made some astragalus and cinnamon soup.

599
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,260
Have some later.

600
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,280
It'll nourish your blood and qi.

601
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:13,350
Are you hungry?

602
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:14,440
Do you want to eat something?

603
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,070
No, thank you.

604
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,160
Let me help you.

605
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,270
It's quite boring just sitting here anyways.

606
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:18,200
No need.

607
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:20,270
I don't need your help.

608
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:21,720
If you're bored,

609
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:23,550
why don't you read for a while?

610
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:24,720
I'll get back to work.

611
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,180
[City Lord's Mansion]

612
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:42,760
Useless!

613
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,540
A bunch of useless fools!

614
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:45,580
Is my study

615
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:47,320
some kind of public tavern?

616
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:49,070
That thief just came and went as he pleased,

617
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:50,010
without any hindrance.

618
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,160
What are you all good for?

619
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,170
Get out, all of you!

620
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:56,380
Search!

621
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,240
Turn everything upside down!

622
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,750
Before nightfall,

623
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:01,830
if you don't find that thief,

624
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:04,270
I'll have you all beheaded!

625
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:05,310
Get out!

626
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,270
Yes, My Lord.

627
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:08,550
Young Mistress! Young Mistress!

628
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:09,280
Make way!

629
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:15,960
Dai.

630
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,640
I know where that item you are looking for is.

631
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:20,020
Let's talk in private.

632
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,720
I've been busy with official matters lately

633
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,200
and haven't had time

634
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:29,790
to come and have a good talk with you, Dai.

635
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:31,010
I've been remiss in my manners.

636
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,640
It's all my fault.

637
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:33,750
Your fault

638
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,290
isn't about manners.

639
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,880
Dai, you've been away from home for a long time.

640
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,610
The current situation in this city is not what it used to be.

641
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,860
It's understandable if you can't comprehend it.

642
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:45,370
Do you really think I can't comprehend it?

643
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:47,960
You're supporting the Wushuang Society to do evil.

644
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,110
I see it very clearly.

645
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:52,530
You're mistaken.

646
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:54,140
Good and evil

647
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:56,080
cannot be summed up so simply.

648
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,240
Father is already old.

649
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:59,560
As his son,

650
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,730
I'm merely sharing his burdens.

651
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:04,560
You speak so righteously.

652
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,510
Is this how you share his burdens?

653
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,280
What else?

654
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,280
The Youhu Clan leads all clans,

655
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,480
standing high above.

656
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,250
The War Demons are watching covetously,

657
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,400
lying in wait on the side.

658
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,590
I'm merely diverting the danger,

659
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:19,440
letting the two clans check each other's power.

660
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,960
If not for this,

661
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:23,670
how could we, the human race, survive in the cracks

662
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:24,920
and wait for our chance to rise?

663
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:27,560
In terms of lifespan,

664
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:29,350
we of the human race are no match for the other two clans.

665
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:30,400
When it comes to strength,

666
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,230
we humans are even more vulnerable.

667
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,840
Dai, I have long seen through this.

668
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,360
Only by widely promoting craftsmanship,

669
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,590
having more children born,

670
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:39,440
and causing constant conflicts between the other two races,

671
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,670
leaving them no time for other matters,

672
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:43,929
can we humans have a way to survive

673
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,810
and have a future.

674
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,030
A way to survive?

675
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,360
Since you know well how strong the other two clans are,

676
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,000
do you realize

677
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,389
that this path of survival you're paving

678
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,139
will be covered with blood and corpses?

679
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,590
Dai, why show such womanly kindness?

680
00:34:57,790 --> 00:34:59,420
Since ancient times, the struggle for supremacy

681
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:01,190
has inevitably led to rivers of blood.

682
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,400
Without sacrifice,

683
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:04,000
how can we achieve peace?

684
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,670
Isn't it peaceful now?

685
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:06,840
The human race is declining.

686
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:07,600
If this continues,

687
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:09,070
do you think it will remain peaceful?

688
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:11,320
The current situation

689
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:13,650
is not the peace I desire.

690
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:15,670
No matter what kind of peace it is,

691
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:19,070
those who disrupt peace will suffer the consequences.

692
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,510
Zhi Yue, you're playing with fire.

693
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:23,480
I'm only worried that this fire isn't burning fiercely

694
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,590
and intensely enough!

695
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:26,840
Dai.

696
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,400
After Father takes the pill,

697
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,190
he'll regain his youth just like you did, right?

698
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,150
When that time comes,

699
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:32,470
let's go persuade him together.

700
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:34,510
He will surely understand the reasoning behind this.

701
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,110
At that time,

702
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,780
with us siblings united,

703
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,470
we'll assist Father in achieving unprecedented feats.

704
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:42,290
For thousands of years to come,

705
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,760
our names will go down in history.

706
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,110
This way, it won't be in vain for us to have come to this world

707
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:46,480
and lived this life.

708
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:48,800
Of course,

709
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,200
since I don't have any pill to take,

710
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:53,320
I naturally won't live as long as you and Father.

711
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,080
Therefore, in future history books,

712
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:57,030
the focus will surely be on you and Father,

713
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:58,710
with great emphasis.

714
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,960
And if the opportunity arises in the future,

715
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,230
perhaps, Dai,

716
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:05,800
you could also take charge

717
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,680
and rule over all.

718
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,630
Shut up!

719
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:12,030
Have you gone mad?

720
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,360
Father has struggled his entire life

721
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,150
just for all races to coexist peacefully.

722
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:17,760
As for your ambitious

723
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,320
and bloody dream,

724
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,480
you'd better wake up before it's too late!

725
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:28,320
Dai, your admonition is right.

726
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,260
I was foolish.

727
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:31,360
I am guilty.

728
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:33,400
I'll order the dissolution of the Wushuang Society immediately.

729
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,510
I'll put an end to my

730
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:35,840
unrealistic ideas.

731
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:37,550
But Dai,

732
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:38,620
please don't

733
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,690
tell Father about this.

734
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,670
You know Father's temper.

735
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:43,150
If he finds out,

736
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,440
he surely won't spare me.

737
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,630
It's too late.

738
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,000
Mr. Tanghua already knows about this.

739
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:50,840
He will surely report it to the Youhu Clan.

740
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:52,630
The cat's out of the bag.

741
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:54,440
Father will find out sooner or later.

742
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,070
That must not happen, Dai.

743
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:01,840
Dai.

744
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:04,280
Please. You must find a way

745
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,230
to save me.

746
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:07,670
If you don't want to face Father's

747
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:08,710
thunderous rage,

748
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,000
I advise you to take the initiative to confess.

749
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:12,800
As soon as Father comes out of seclusion,

750
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,480
tell him everything

751
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,710
and sincerely repent.

752
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,480
There will surely be punishment,

753
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,150
but considering you turn yourself in,

754
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:22,070
Father will surely spare your life.

755
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:28,630
Father will be out of seclusion soon.

756
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:31,140
Will you tell him yourself or should I,

757
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,320
or should we wait until it's exposed

758
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,880
and let the Youhu Clan tell him?

759
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,280
I advise you to weigh your options carefully.

760
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:01,850
Xue.

761
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,190
High Priest, you're here.

762
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:06,320
I just bought two chickens from the market.

763
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,560
I'll make chicken soup for everyone later.

764
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:08,710
Here, let me take them.

765
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,840
Here are some dried apricots too.

766
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,550
Thank you.

767
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,880
Hurry up and go inside.

768
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,030
Tanyin must be very happy.

769
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,640
She's been saying she's bored since early this morning.

770
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:30,920
Qian Lin.

771
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:32,280
Go check in the kitchen quickly

772
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,110
to see if the medicinal soup for Tanyin

773
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:34,000
is ready.

774
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,190
Good morning.

775
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,710
What are you reading?

776
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,110
Take a look.

777
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,360
"There is a square pond, about 3 meters wide,

778
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:52,800
with a reed growing in its center,

779
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,480
which extends about 30 centimeters above the water.

780
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:56,000
When the reed is pulled to the shore,

781
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:57,480
it just reaches the edge.

782
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,630
The question is, what is the depth of the water,

783
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,590
and how long is the reed?“

784
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:07,710
”There's a skilled walker and an unskilled walker. In the time it takes the skilled one to walk 100 steps,

785
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:09,880
the unskilled one can walk 60 steps.

786
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:12,960
Now, the unskilled walker starts 100 steps ahead,

787
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:14,780
and the skilled walker chases after him.

788
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:17,840
The question is, how many steps will it take for him to catch up?"

789
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:27,800
This is...

790
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:29,230
This is an arithmetic book I found

791
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:29,710
in the

792
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:31,400
original owner's cabinet.

793
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,670
It should be for little children.

794
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:34,920
You can't understand it, can you?

795
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,400
It's for children?

796
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:40,320
Isn't it very difficult?

797
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,320
Not really.

798
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:45,150
The human race has too many books.

799
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:47,030
I don't specifically read arithmetic books.

800
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,190
I know.

801
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:54,040
I've read many other books too.

802
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:54,880
Yes, yes.

803
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,920
I know.

804
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:02,600
Is it really for children?

805
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,800
The curriculum of you human race

806
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,880
is too difficult.

807
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,230
Indeed.

808
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,850
It's not easy for the little ones, either.

809
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,140
What happened to your sleeve?

810
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,030
I went out today

811
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:19,920
to buy some things.

812
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:22,280
It might have been scratched by a cage.

813
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,150
It's not a big deal.

814
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,070
So, can I

815
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:25,760
go out for a walk today?

816
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:28,150
Xue said you're deficient in qi and blood.

817
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:29,840
Yet you're thinking about going for a walk on the street?

818
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:31,110
Take your medicine first.

819
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:33,360
Can I go out after I finish it?

820
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,360
Not necessarily.

821
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,400
But if you don't take it,

822
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,840
you definitely can't go out.

823
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,150
Is it bitter?

824
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,150
Yes, it is.

825
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:49,780
Then why don't I see you frowning?

826
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:50,880
I can still bear it.

827
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:52,960
Here.

828
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:00,890
It's so sour.

829
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:03,280
This I can't bear.

830
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:05,920
Alright.

831
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,510
Although you can't go out on the street,

832
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:09,550
you can still get some fresh air

833
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,590
in the courtyard.

834
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:12,510
Are you going back on your word?

835
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:16,760
I can walk by myself.

836
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:18,400
Don't drop me.

837
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,070
Qian Lin.

838
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,320
You've recovered?

839
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,810
Did you help him restore his magic source?

840
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,360
Who else could it be if not me?

841
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:50,550
Do you think he can grow another magic source

842
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:51,710
like growing a tooth?

843
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:53,850
Alright, alright.

844
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:55,070
Go practice outside.

845
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:56,030
Look what you've done

846
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:57,210
to this courtyard.

847
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:58,360
Alright.

848
00:41:58,510 --> 00:41:59,800
He wasn't so submissive to you before

849
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:00,880
as he is now.

850
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,150
How could it be the same?

851
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:04,030
I used to be his enemy.

852
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:05,110
Now I'm his...

853
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,440
Never mind.

854
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,960
It's better to remain his enemy.

855
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,230
Xue alone

856
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:26,360
has to take care of both of you.

857
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,960
It's really not easy.

858
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,400
She's a very good person.

859
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:31,680
I cherish her very much.

860
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:34,580
You can say nice things to my face.

861
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,000
Saying them behind my back,

862
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,400
I won't be able to hear them.

863
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:40,480
Who did this?

864
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,070
Don't tell me you three

865
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:43,760
had a fight while I was away!

866
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:45,550
I can't possibly beat those two.

867
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:47,510
Qian Lin.

868
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:49,000
It must have been Qian Lin.

869
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:50,800
He always has a problem with my flowers.

870
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:51,710
Perhaps this place of yours

871
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:52,920
has a conflict with the wood element.

872
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,920
Why don't I help you turn it into a fish pond?

873
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,230
Where is he?
