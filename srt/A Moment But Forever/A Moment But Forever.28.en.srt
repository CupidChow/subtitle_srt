[A Moment But Forever]

00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,240
[Episode 28]

3
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,200
Xue has to

4
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,310
take care of both of you alone.

5
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,070
It must be really tough.

6
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,350
She is a very good person.

7
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:57,680
I cherish her very much.

8
00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:00,560
You can say nice things to my face, you know.

9
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,870
Saying them behind my back,

10
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,310
I won't be able to hear them.

11
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,400
Who did this?

12
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,640
Qian Lin.

13
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,080
It must be Qian Lin.

14
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,910
He just hates my flowers.

15
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,080
Where is he?

16
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,630
Bravo!

17
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,190
Not bad with your training.

18
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,670
Hurry and hand out the dates to the children.

19
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,680
Come here, kids.

20
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,290
Come on, come on, have some dates.

21
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:56,590
Slow down, slow down.

22
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,860
Don't fight, don't fight, don't fight.

23
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:58,430
Give me one.

24
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,310
Okay, okay, okay.

25
00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:00,360
Take some more.

26
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:00,710
Take more.

27
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:01,310
I want some too.

28
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,030
Thank you.

29
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,080
Look how beautiful that cloud is.

30
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,900
It looks like a majestic tiger.

31
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,510
More like a paper tiger.

32
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,870
When the wind blows,

33
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,310
it'll be gone.

34
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:16,810
You're such a killjoy.

35
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,800
The truth

36
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,360
is unpleasant.

37
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,800
When I was in the tower ship,

38
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,079
I never thought

39
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,240
that one day

40
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,430
I'd be able to watch clouds with someone

41
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,000
at the door of my own house.

42
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,350
I never thought either

43
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,280
that this thing

44
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,870
would be something people enjoy.

45
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,630
You don't like it,

46
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,840
but you're still watching it with me.

47
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,800
And you don't hate me,

48
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,520
right?

49
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,000
Thank you for taking care of me these days.

50
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,030
I'm grateful to you.

51
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,000
Alright, alright, alright.

52
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:04,960
Don't be in such a hurry

53
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,910
to set boundaries with me.

54
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,470
I know you like Tanyin.

55
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:13,030
Why doesn't anyone like me?

56
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,600
You just haven't met the right person yet.

57
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:19,760
Right?

58
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,000
I guess I'll wait a bit longer then.

59
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,270
Look at that cloud.

60
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,800
Doesn't it look like a fish?

61
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,240
Braised fish, maybe.

62
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,070
Can't it be steamed?

63
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,110
No, wait.

64
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,820
Why does it have to be cooked?

65
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:39,159
I want a fish swimming in the river.

66
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,159
Alright.

67
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:44,210
Look at that cloud.

68
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,680
Isn't it adorable?

69
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,460
Doesn't it look just like my face?

70
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,480
How are you feeling?

71
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,430
Do you feel better after getting some fresh air?

72
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,800
I've been feeling much better for a while now.

73
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,800
Don't worry.

74
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:08,520
You seem to be very happy here.

75
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,600
Yes, indeed.

76
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,430
Because I have Xue here.

77
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:13,790
And Qian Lin.

78
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:15,750
And also...

79
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,870
And you.

80
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,000
Tell me,

81
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,750
do you think Qian Lin will fully recover?

82
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,830
It's hard to say.

83
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:32,920
Really?

84
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,630
What if he becomes even better than before?

85
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,240
I have an errand to run.

86
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,510
You can continue practicing here.

87
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,820
♫Ask the heavens♫

88
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,720
♫I don't know why I'm without a home♫

89
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:03,980
♫I'm at a dead end♫

90
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,800
♫And I have to surrender and accept my destiny♫

91
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,550
♫I'm the wandering one♫

92
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,410
♫My body and mind, falling into dust♫

93
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,440
♫Only the moon in the sky♫

♫The scars you can't see♫

96
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,980
♫Are the proof of my struggle♫

♫Don't tell me what's right or wrong♫

103
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,240
Your staff technique is good.

104
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,190
You know about staff techniques?

105
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,390
Not really.

106
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,430
But I can see some intricacies in it.

107
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,430
Was it taught by a master?

108
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,480
I suppose so.

109
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,510
Not bad.

110
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,159
It's a pity it was taught to the wrong person.

111
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,159
Stop right there.

112
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,040
What do you mean by that?

113
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,870
What I mean is,

114
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,750
although the staff technique is exquisite,

115
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,430
you've only learned the form

116
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,870
without grasping its essence.

117
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,390
That's quite a bold statement.

118
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,000
Didn't you say you don't know about staff techniques?

119
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,040
Does one need to be a chef

120
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,720
to judge the quality of a dish?

121
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,870
Who are you calling a chef?

122
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:15,790
It's hard to explain to you.

123
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,360
Did I say you could leave?

124
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:21,360
Seems like you haven't learned your lesson.

125
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,030
You helped me.

126
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,240
I remember that.

127
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:26,770
But that's a separate matter.

128
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,560
You can't leave without explaining yourself.

129
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,040
What's the matter? Getting anxious?

130
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,720
Do you think being a chef is shameful?

131
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,710
You War Demons grew up eating dirt.

132
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,180
You think being a chef is easy?

133
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:39,330
Being a chef

134
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,159
requires understanding fire and seasoning,

135
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,510
knowing when to add ingredients,

136
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,630
when to take them out,

137
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,830
balancing rich broths and delicate flavors,

138
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:47,020
achieving the right color,

139
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,810
and mastering every aspect with precision.

140
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,159
Can you do that?

141
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,800
It's not easy to perfect

142
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,380
anything in this world.

143
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,240
For a War Demon,

144
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:59,850
is it so difficult to ask for guidance?

145
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,190
There's more to what you're saying.

146
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,190
Do you have a way to help me?

147
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,800
I do.

148
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:08,600
What will it take for you to tell me?

149
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:10,130
Do you want me to kneel and beg?

150
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,650
Just say, "Please teach me."

151
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,070
What can you teach me?

152
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,600
That depends on what you want to learn.

153
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:19,680
Alright.

154
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,070
Please teach me.

155
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:23,430
What did you say?

156
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:25,640
Your voice was too soft. I couldn't hear.

157
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,830
Please teach me.

158
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:31,390
You're asking for me to teach you?

159
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:32,840
Teach you what?

160
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,320
Please teach me,

161
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,600
whom you just restored the magic source of,

162
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:37,789
how I can return

163
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:39,080
to my previous state

164
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:40,230
so that I can take revenge.

165
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,390
Very well.

166
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,000
Then I need an attitude from you.

167
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,720
Please enlighten me.

168
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,030
It's simple.

169
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,390
Let go of your so-called prejudices

170
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,200
and unnecessary pride.

171
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:06,910
Be a good chef.

172
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:07,960
You're toying with me.

173
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,000
I haven't finished.

174
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,790
Speak!

175
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,960
In this vast world,

176
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,630
culinary skills are inexhaustible.

177
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,440
As I said,

178
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,440
if you want to be a top chef,

179
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:20,960
you need to experience all kinds of cuisines

180
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,200
and learn from renowned masters.

181
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:24,910
But if you want to be

182
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,200
a good chef in chaotic times,

183
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,910
you don't need to be bound by

184
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,440
so many rules and regulations.

185
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,870
A good chef in chaotic times...

186
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,360
What do I do?

187
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,960
Let go of all tricks.

188
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:37,080
As long as what you make

189
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,320
can fill the stomachs of hungry people,

190
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,360
you are a good chef.

191
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,200
I don't understand.

192
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,670
Who a good chef is,

193
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,600
is decided by the diners.

194
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:51,790
There aren't so many rules that must be followed.

195
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:52,720
So?

196
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,480
So,

197
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,290
who decides who can become

198
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,790
a perfect War Demon?

199
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,970
I've never thought about that.

200
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,270
Maybe it's

201
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,390
the fortune of the War Demon ancestors

202
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:06,440
and their recognition.

203
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,080
Who says there's only one way

204
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,850
to be recognized by ancestral fortune?

205
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:37,360
Young City Lord.

206
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:42,480
Where is that Youhu scoundrel?

207
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,790
We've already sent scouts to watch him.

208
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:46,960
Tang is now in the inn.

209
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,480
No movement for now.

210
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,680
Should we forcefully kill him?

211
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,670
No need.

212
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,360
Just keep watching him.

213
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,870
He's the commander of the Youhu Clan's War Division.

214
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:58,980
His strength is considerable.

215
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,900
It won't be easy to kill him.

216
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,320
Even without the commotion it would cause,

217
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,490
if he managed to escape,

218
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,270
it would alert our enemies.

219
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:11,770
Then, just keep watching?

220
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,840
He has a close relationship with Zhi Dai.

221
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,270
He probably won't hide it from her

222
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,510
and report the matter.

223
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,220
At least not now.

224
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,080
The time we've gained

225
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,320
should be enough.

226
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,270
He's no longer important.

227
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,080
What about the other two?

228
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,720
We've positioned people

229
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,720
around Young Mistress Dai.

230
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:40,910
City Lord...

231
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:41,550
Speak.

232
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,000
The City Lord

233
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,890
removed all soldiers from outside the room.

234
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:50,600
Okay.

235
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,840
Quickly prepare the wine.

236
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,010
Young City Lord,

237
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,720
do you really want to do this?

238
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,150
Some things,

239
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,550
once done,

240
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,150
are hard to undo.

241
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,150
I have already

242
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,760
reached the point of no return.

243
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:36,510
What is it?

244
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,480
I apologize for disturbing your seclusion, Father.

245
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,870
Please forgive me.

246
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,270
Ah, it's Yue.

247
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,080
What brings you here?

248
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,000
Father,

249
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,560
Dai has returned.

250
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,320
She brought news

251
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,200
that the fox clan's immortal medicine

252
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:57,510
must be accompanied by

253
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,480
their specially made immortal wine

254
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,170
for the effects to last.

255
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,430
I didn't dare delay,

256
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,960
so I specially obtained this wine

257
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,910
to bring to you.

258
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,790
You are thoughtful, my son.

259
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,080
I'm done. You can take it away.

260
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,120
Yes.

261
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:49,960
Is there something else?

262
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:51,870
N-Nothing.

263
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:06,480
How dare you!

264
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:10,890
The food was poisoned.

265
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:11,870
Indeed.

266
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:13,480
The Young City Lord calculated well.

267
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,270
You've already been poisoned with a power-sealing toxin.

268
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:16,870
Surrender obediently now.

269
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:20,450
It's Zhi Yue who wants to arrest me, isn't it?

270
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,030
Acting like this

271
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,200
is no different from rebellion.

272
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,270
My father would never forgive you.

273
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,750
The rebel is you!

274
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,080
All units, attention!

275
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,000
The City Lord has died suddenly.

276
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,750
Young Mistress Dai is under heavy suspicion.

277
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,320
Arrest her immediately!

278
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,000
Yes, sir!

279
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,910
Qian Lin is meditating outside.

280
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:48,240
Why has he been sitting there for so long?

281
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:49,550
Don't worry about him.

282
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:51,440
But...

283
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:52,960
It's fine.

284
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,670
I just gave him a little guidance.

285
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,840
Thank you, Yuanzhong.

286
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,980
There's no need for thanks between us.

287
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:03,500
He's your good friend,

288
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:04,570
so of course I'll treat him

289
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:05,680
as a close bodyguard.

290
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,120
It's normal to look after him.

291
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,440
He doesn't want to be

292
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,600
your bodyguard at all.

293
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:10,960
If he hears you say that,

294
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,320
he'll get angry again.

295
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,670
Aren't you afraid of making me angry?

296
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,030
Of course not.

297
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,390
Let's play a game.

298
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:25,150
It's very popular in the Mortal Realm recently.

299
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,550
Do you see that hook?

300
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,360
We'll try to throw this ring over it.

301
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,270
The person who loses

302
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,270
can grant the winner

303
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:34,000
a wish.

304
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,030
They can accumulate, you know.

305
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,610
Is this game really from the Mortal Realm?

306
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,240
Where did you see it?

307
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,030
Why are you asking so many questions?

308
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,150
Let me show you how it's done.

309
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,240
Come on, hurry.

310
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,870
It's okay, try again.

311
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:05,320
Watch me.

312
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,630
It's your turn.

313
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,670
It must be because the hook I made

314
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,750
isn't curved enough.

315
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:29,550
Next time, I'll make you

316
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:30,790
a better one.

317
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,240
Why do I feel like

318
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,600
you're toying with me?

319
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:38,550
I'm not.

320
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:43,080
Don't go.

321
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,240
Don't be angry.

322
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:45,720
I'm not angry.

323
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:47,380
I'm just going to pick up the things.

324
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,080
You don't need to pick them up.

325
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,200
I'll do it.

326
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,390
Why aren't you taking this seriously?

327
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,360
I've worked on this for a long time.

328
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,440
Because I don't need to win.

329
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:03,480
Because...

330
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,720
Because I want

331
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:09,400
to fulfill all your wishes.

332
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:19,869

00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,270
Qian Lin!

362
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,240
What's wrong with him?

363
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,640
He's not doing breath-holding too, is he?

364
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,550
It's alright, he's just practicing his skills.

365
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,790
Let's not disturb him.

366
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:25,920
Come on, let's go first.

367
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,110
Tanyin.

368
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,920
You've been shopping for a long time.

369
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,510
What exactly do you want to buy?

370
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:36,880
I want to buy some fabric

371
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,070
and some silk thread.

372
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:40,580
I know where to find good materials,

373
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:41,610
and they're affordable too.

374
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,270
I remember it's over there.

375
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:44,350
Come on, I'll take you there.

376
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,720
Tanyin.

377
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,240
Tanyin?

378
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,030
I didn't expect this.

379
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,030
I really didn't expect

380
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,070
that the god of the Youhu Clan has become a demon.

381
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:43,580
Even without becoming a demon, I can still kill you.

382
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,830
Having become a demon,

383
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,510
I can still spare your miserable life.

384
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,030
You were there that night, weren't you?

385
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,200
You saw everything?

386
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,310
You're so afraid,

387
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,030
yet you still dared to come here.

388
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,440
Dingxu, you've got some brains.

389
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,680
In this world,

390
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,270
there are plenty of cold-hearted, greedy,

391
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:17,240
stubborn, and unrepentant individuals.

392
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,790
Those as evil as you

393
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,590
all deserve to die.

394
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,000
Therefore,

395
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,590
I once thought of using the power of the Divine Hand

396
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:27,010
to bring down divine punishment

397
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,270
and make this world

398
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:31,400
completely pure and righteous again.

399
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,920
At that time,

400
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,660
people like you

401
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:36,750
would all disappear.

402
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:39,640
Demon!

403
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,400
How can you do this?

404
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,590
Whether I would do this or not,

405
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:47,260
don't you know better than anyone else?

406
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,240
However,

407
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,400
I don't plan to do that anymore.

408
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,810
Is that so?

409
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,240
Yes.

410
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,680
You're in your twilight years,

411
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,550
and you have no Blood Pills left to use.

412
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,920
You don't have many days left to live anyway.

413
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,550
So I can't be bothered to kill you myself.

414
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,750
But

415
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,160
if you dare

416
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,590
to sneak around behind my back again

417
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,000
and do some disrespectful things,

418
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:18,240
I won't mind shortening

419
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:19,790
your lifespan even further.

420
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:23,110
Do you understand?

421
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,110
Go now.

422
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,780
Hide where I can't see you.

423
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:37,680
Ladies.

424
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:38,950
Shopkeeper, bring some silk thread.

425
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,200
I'll choose some fabric too.

426
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:40,960
Alright!

427
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,790
Tanyin,

428
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,070
I noticed you don't have many clothes.

429
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,750
Are you making new clothes for yourself?

430
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,400
Having enough clothes to wear is fine.

431
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:47,960
I saw that

432
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,270
Yuanzhong's robe was damaged,

433
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,830
so I want to make him a new one.

434
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:53,470
You are so nice to the High Priest.

435
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,590
Did you

436
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:57,110
bring his measurements with you?

437
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,590
How much fabric do we need to buy?

438
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,830
Have you forgotten?

439
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:00,880
I'm a craftsman.

440
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,550
I can tell at a glance.

441
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:03,750
The measurements

442
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:04,720
are right here.

443
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,080
Shopkeeper,

444
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,200
please cut 10 meters

445
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:07,880
of this fabric

446
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,790
and match it with some silk thread.

447
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:09,920
Remember to pack them up.

448
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,750
Alright!

449
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,270
Tanyin,

450
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:17,590
shall we go back now?

451
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:18,920
What's wrong?

452
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,070
Are you tired from shopping?

453
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,790
No.

454
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,970
But when we came out,

455
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,640
we didn't tell the High Priest.

456
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:26,960
If he finds out

457
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,270
that you went out while you're sick,

458
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,560
he'll definitely be upset.

459
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,270
Why are you so afraid of him?

460
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:32,590
Of course I'm afraid.

461
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:33,590
Aren't you?

462
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:34,880
I think you're afraid too.

463
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,240
Good morning.

464
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,680
Didn't I tell you

465
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:41,810
not to go out yet?

466
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,160
I told you too

467
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,200
that I'm already better.

468
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,320
High Priest, why did you come out?

469
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,430
I came out to find you two.

470
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,030
Alright.

471
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:16,590
Fine.

472
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:18,540
Remember to tell me in advance next time.

473
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:19,510
I got it.

474
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:30,590
Can you help her for a while?

475
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:31,880
I'll go inside and work for a bit.

476
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,070
What are you doing?

477
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,200
High Priest.

478
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:36,750
Give me the fish.

479
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:37,830
I'll go clean it.

480
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:39,030
Then what should I do?

481
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,880
High Priest, if it's convenient,

482
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,660
could you help me start the fire?

483
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,960
Thank you, High Priest.

484
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:49,920
Move aside.

485
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,680
Move aside.

486
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:55,240
Move aside, move aside.

487
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:08,830
Yuanzhong!

488
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,480
Yuanzhong.

489
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:12,920
What's the matter?

490
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,240
Quickly look at this.

491
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:16,310
Did you make this?

492
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,030
Yes, I did.

493
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:18,510
You made it just now?

494
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,550
Yes, just now.

495
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,960
That's so fast. Let me see.

496
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:23,930
This isn't even considered fast.

497
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,120
I saw that your clothes were damaged.

498
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,790
I've been wanting to make you a new one.

499
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:27,790
I just took apart the sleeves

500
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:28,400
and remade them.

501
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,790
Otherwise, it would have been even faster.

502
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,200
Come on, let's go try it on.

503
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,920
When will my love

504
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,070
bloom?

505
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:27,910
Turn around and let me see.

506
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:38,640
Isn't this...

507
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,350
I bought this for you

508
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,640
a while ago.

509
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,380
You were angry with me then,

510
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,070
so I never got to put it on you.

511
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:49,350
Ji Tanyin,

512
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,480
I promise

513
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,790
I'll never get angry with you again.

514
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,290
Really.

515
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:01,110
What does "oh" mean?

516
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,550
It means I got it.

517
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:09,400
It looks quite nice.

518
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,240
I think it looks nice too.

519
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:20,530
It's wonderful.

520
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,200
What is?

521
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:25,200
To be cared for

522
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:27,550
is wonderful.

523
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:45,750
How's your wound?

524
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:47,310
It's nothing.

525
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:48,400
Zhi Yue did it.

526
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,240
As expected.

527
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:51,960
Shall we go find him now?

528
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:53,680
No, we're going to see the High Priest.

529
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:55,370
Jiuguang has found his whereabouts.

530
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,130
Young City Lord.

531
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,100
What is it?

532
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:13,980
Young Mistress Dai has been taken by the Youhu Clan.

533
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:15,100
Are you sure?

534
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,920
It was the Youhu Clan?

535
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,340
The news just came in.

536
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:19,430
It's absolutely certain.

537
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,830
If the Youhu Clan and Young Mistress Dai

538
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:21,720
come together

539
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:23,350
to attend the old City Lord's funeral,

540
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:24,660
then we...

541
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:28,570
Quickly, bring me my token.

542
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,200
I need to send a message to

543
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,400
Li Chaoyang, Chief of the War Demons.

544
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:33,310
Hurry!

545
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:34,130
Yes, sir.

546
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:35,830
Is anyone there?

547
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:37,110
Is anyone there?

548
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:37,830
Coming!

549
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,180
Who are you looking for?

550
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:46,590
We're looking for the High Priest.

551
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:52,240
You said Zhi Yue killed his father?

552
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:53,830
That's correct.

553
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,350
I've already sent word back to our clan.

554
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:58,100
Not only did Zhi Yue commit patricide,

555
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,240
but he's also in cahoots with the War Demons.

556
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,790
The reason why the War Demons have

557
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:04,880
remained influential despite their decline

558
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,640
is thanks to the help of the Wushuang Chamber of Commerce.

559
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:10,030
And the person behind this sinister Wushuang Chamber of Commerce

560
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:12,240
is none other than Zhi Yue.

561
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,470
This man has been plotting among the human race for a long time.

562
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,720
He's eyeing our Youhu Clan.

563
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,310
A catastrophe seems inevitable.

564
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,240
Zhi Dai originally wanted to persuade Zhi Yue

565
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,270
to return to the right path

566
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,920
but ended up being held under house arrest by him instead.

567
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,030
Fortunately, I sent Jiuguang in advance

568
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:27,070
to keep an eye on this matter

569
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,450
and rescued her.

570
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,510
Three days from now is the City Lord's grand funeral.

571
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:32,570
By then, the new City Lord will take office.

572
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,750
If Zhi Yue is allowed

573
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,330
to ascend to the position of Yandu City Lord,

574
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:36,830
then the situation of both

575
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:38,590
the human race and the Youhu Clan

576
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:39,640
will be in grave danger.

577
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,830
I have sent a letter to Elder Xinyao.

578
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,160
She replied saying

579
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,070
Baili Xiang will bring

580
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:45,160
the soldiers of the Youhu Clan

581
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,200
and rush here overnight.

582
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,440
Yuanzhong,

583
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,240
what are your plans for this matter?

584
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:55,070
Yuanzhong,

585
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,200
given the current situation,

586
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,720
you won't also

587
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,960
stand idly by this time, will you?

588
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:07,590
The way you said "also" is really...

589
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:12,680
She was a handmaiden from Fangwai Mountain,

590
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:13,590
right?

591
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,720
Yes.

592
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,350
Those years, Zhi Dai

593
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:18,920
went up the mountain for my sake.

594
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:20,830
In the end, I let her down.

595
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,720
Now that she's in this predicament,

596
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,240
I must protect her at all costs.

597
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:26,880
Tanghua,

598
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:30,310
someone just told me recently

599
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:32,200
that this world is vast.

600
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,550
It's not just about the petty interests,

601
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:35,520
conflicts, and struggles

602
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:37,300
of the Youhu Clan, the War Demon Clan,

603
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:38,810
or the human race.

604
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,270
There are many other places

605
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:41,490
worth visiting,

606
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,310
many sights

607
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,160
worth seeing.

608
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,000
However,

609
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:51,880
since this is your matter, Tanghua...

610
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,070
I naturally have no reason

611
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:57,270
to not get involved.

612
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:24,720
Are your injuries serious?

613
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,480
It's nothing.

614
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,550
When I came down the mountain,

615
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,330
I thought you were dead.

616
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,270
I didn't know

617
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:35,880
you were the human Young Mistress of Yandu.

618
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,720
Seeing you alive

619
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,750
is truly wonderful.

620
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,710
People come and go,

621
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:41,780
gather and part.

622
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,030
It's all in due time.

623
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,880
Just like how the sun, moon, and stars take turns,

624
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:46,870
life goes on endlessly.

625
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:49,110
Although your father has passed away,

626
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,130
he always thought of you,

627
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:52,960
and you always thought of him.

628
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:54,790
This is the fulfillment

629
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:56,160
of your father-daughter relationship in this life.

630
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:57,680
I understand.

631
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,600
Thank you, Ji Tanyin.

632
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:06,440
Young Mistress Dai,

633
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,640
I understand your concerns,

634
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,830
and I'm willing to lend you a hand.

635
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,200
But you must know

636
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,750
that there'll surely be a fierce battle when the time comes.

637
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,590
I'm prepared

638
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:18,910
for all possibilities.

639
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,920
That's good then.

640
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:22,640
Your willingness to help

641
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:24,960
is deeply appreciated by the human race.

642
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:28,300
Thank you, High Priest.

643
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,030
Please rise.

644
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:33,580
Get up quickly.

645
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:36,790
Zhi Yue's actions

646
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:38,810
are no longer just the internal affairs of the human race.

647
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:40,590
Since I am still

648
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:41,960
the High Priest of the Youhu Clan,

649
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,200
I can't just stand by and do nothing.

650
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,920
You haven't eaten much at all.

651
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:06,840
I've made some sweet soup.

652
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:08,510
Drink it while it's hot.

653
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,550
Is there anything else

654
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:23,590
I can do for you?

655
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:30,590
I've also experienced

656
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:32,110
the pain of losing loved ones,

657
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,449
so I understand

658
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:36,440
that at times like these,

659
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,510
no matter who it is

660
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:41,290
or what they say, it's all useless.

661
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:43,630
You just want to be alone

662
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:44,480
and have some quiet time.

663
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,400
Whether it's having a good cry

664
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,710
or getting drunk,

665
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,230
the point is,

666
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:55,760
don't keep it all bottled up inside.

667
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,360
I'll be right outside the door.

668
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:11,310
I'll always be here.

669
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:44,510
Grand Elder,

670
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,800
I'll go find a doctor for you.

671
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,280
Wait for me.

672
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,800
It's useless, useless.

673
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,760
Yuanzhong.

674
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:53,310
Blood Pill.

675
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,330
Blood Pill?

676
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,590
Blood Pill.

677
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:57,400
Do I still have one?

678
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,540
Yes, I do.

679
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:03,510
Alright, I'll go get it.

680
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,240
Mr. Tanghua.

681
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,510
Elder, you've traveled a long way here.

682
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:36,420
Thank you for your hard work.

683
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,670
It's my duty.

684
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:40,000
The situation in Yandu is complicated now

685
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,190
and the City Lord has just passed away.

686
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:42,840
It's necessary for us to come earlier

687
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,920
to make proper preparations.

688
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:46,400
Now the War Demons are coming with great force.

689
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:48,210
Zhi Yue has also been plotting for years,

690
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:49,710
intending to make a move against our clan.

691
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,480
I'm afraid there might be a major incident.

692
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:52,510
I'll take you immediately

693
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:53,670
to see the High Priest.

694
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,800
The High Priest is here too?

695
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:57,880
Yes.

696
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:01,950
Sir, then I must trouble you

697
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:03,610
to take them there first.

698
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:06,480
Elder, aren't you coming

699
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,630
with us?

700
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:09,280
On my way here,

701
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,190
I've already contacted

702
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:12,230
an informant in Yandu City.

703
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,360
One of his subordinates

704
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,510
is waiting for me in the south of the city.

705
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:15,710
He has a detailed map

706
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:17,800
of the City Lord's Mansion in Yandu.

707
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,630
We should

708
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:23,580
get a clear understanding first.

709
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,920
As always, Elder, you've thought of everything.

710
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:31,160
Then I'll go ahead first.

711
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:51,640
Chief Li Chaoyang.

712
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:54,300
I've been looking forward to this for a long time.

713
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:56,590
We've been corresponding for years,

714
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,760
and today

715
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:00,310
I finally get to see you in person.

716
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:03,410
It's not I who wants to see you.

717
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:07,270
It's the god who wants to see you.

718
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,440
[Wushuang Society Secret Manual]

719
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,720
This can't be real.

720
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:26,670
How can the Wushuang Secret Manual

721
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,360
reappear in the Mortal Realm?

722
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:30,320
This is impossible.

723
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:32,040
You must know

724
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:33,900
if it's real or not.

725
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,070
Master,

726
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:39,000
would you be willing to help your student?

727
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,580
What do you want me to do?

728
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,440
The weather is so nice today.

729
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,920
The sun isn't too harsh either

730
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,320
and there's no wind.

731
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,920
I'm feeling much better too.

732
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,070
What do you think?

733
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,680
What are you trying to say?

734
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:51,800
Can't I go with you?

735
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,110
You want to go?

736
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:05,360
Are you worried about me?

737
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:08,440
I don't know why,

738
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,070
but I feel uneasy.

739
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:12,550
After today,

740
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:14,430
let's leave Yandu.

741
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:16,030
Where to?

742
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,290
Anywhere.

743
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:22,510
As long as I'm with you,

744
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,950
anywhere is fine.

745
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,110
In the south, there's a giant beast

746
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:05,630
called the elephant.

747
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:07,820
Its body is like a small mountain,

748
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,630
weighing tens of thousands of jin.

749
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:12,030
I saw one once.

750
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:15,190
A street performer

751
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,070
used a rope as thin as a pinky

752
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,840
to tie it securely.

753
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:23,070
He whipped and scolded it,

754
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:25,760
yet the elephant didn't dare to resist.

755
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,630
I asked the performer,

756
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,150
"This elephant weighs tens of thousands of jin.

757
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:33,070
Why does it submit to you?"

758
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:35,030
Guess what he said?

759
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,030
He said this elephant

760
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,510
had been bound by this rope

761
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:41,220
since it was young.

762
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:49,550
Qian Lin,

763
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:52,820
find the rope that binds you

764
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:54,780
and untie it.

765
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:20,860
[Yandu City]

766
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:43,000
Are you alright?

767
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,110
I'm fine.

768
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:46,720
Here, take this.

769
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:48,360
Thank you, sir.

770
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,230
My father said there's something big happening in the city today.

771
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,150
No one is allowed to play on the streets.

772
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:55,880
Then you should hurry home.

773
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,550
You should go home too.
