00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:44,240
[A Moment But Forever]

2
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,240
[Episode 8]

3
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,030
Which one to choose?

4
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,430
Between these two.

5
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:13,710
What does that mean?

6
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:17,270
The flag can summon

7
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,390
Ji Tanyin's spirit

8
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:19,840
and purify her soul.

9
00:02:20,829 --> 00:02:23,430
Reciting scriptures can help Ji Tanyin transcend,

10
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,590
eliminating all ominous deaths

11
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:28,910
and guiding her towards a prosperous and smooth reincarnation.

12
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:32,820
I asked the maids of Xiaoxiang Peak.

13
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:34,030
They all burry the deceased

14
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,190
in this manner.

15
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,300
Let's recite the scriptures.

16
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,760
Ji Tanyin,

17
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,340
come back.

18
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,700
Ji Tanyin,

19
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,760
come back.

20
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:55,829
Ji Tanyin,

21
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:57,070
a native of Pingzhou,

22
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:58,829
was a skilled artisan of the human race.

23
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:01,390
She was later recommended to join our Youhu Clan

24
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,600
[The Spiritual Seat of Ji Tanyin, Immortal Maiden and Servant Under the High Priest of Liujiao Palace]

25
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:02,750
to cultivate in the mountains.

26
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,550
Can't you stay for two more days?

27
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:09,550
After all, you've died once already.

28
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,150
My physical body is still down there.

29
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,670
If this gets delayed any further,

30
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,190
the body will start to rot.

31
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,550
You're a deity. Your corpse won't decay.

32
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:16,750
How could it possibly rot?

33
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,510
Tanyin, let me remind you one more time.

34
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,960
You are kind-hearted

35
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,060
and reluctant to kill him.

36
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,910
I'll tolerate it for now,

37
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,810
but if you interfere with his fate

38
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,130
and protect him,

39
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,310
as long as I find out,

40
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,310
I will never spare you.

41
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,310
I understand.

42
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:33,150
You've already died once

43
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:34,540
in front of him.

44
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:36,300
Have you thought about how to explain why you are back?

45
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,590
I am willing to sincerely recite this mantra

46
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,950
for Ji Tanyin,

47
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,230
hoping for her early nirvana.

48
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:47,950
Yuanzhong,

49
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,020
the ceremony can proceed to

50
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,010
the next step.

51
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:54,710
What else?

52
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,030
Mourn for the deceased,

53
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,350
express regrets for any wrongs done to her while alive,

54
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:59,990
so that she may rest in peace.

55
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,990
This is no longer necessary, is it?

56
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:06,190
Suit yourself.

57
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,390
I do owe her, after all.

58
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,230
Ji Tanyin,

59
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,710
since you arrived at the Liujiao Palace,

60
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,390
we have never treated you well.

61
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,950
I never expected that in the face of danger,

62
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:19,470
you would die to save Yuanzhong.

63
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:20,950
Actually, from the first time he met you,

64
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,380
he began to suspect you,

65
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,510
saying you had ulterior motives

66
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,550
and wanted to murder him.

67
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,550
I was also acting on Yuanzhong's instructions

68
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,310
testing you secretly all along.

69
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,510
We deliberately assigned you

70
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:30,870
difficult and dirty tasks

71
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:31,910
to do.

72
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,590
Didn't I tell you before

73
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:34,550
that Yuan Zhong required

74
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:36,070
eight meat dishes and eight vegetable dishes for each meal?

75
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,950
That was a lie.

76
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,070
Before you came,

77
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,790
he had at most two dishes per meal.

78
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:41,409
He...

79
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,270
Just talk about yourself.

80
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,350
Why do you keep bringing me into this?

81
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:47,950
Alright.

82
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,150
Ji Tanyin,

83
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,790
then I have nothing more to say.

84
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:54,870
Please rest in peace.

85
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,350
You were having so much to say,

86
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,159
but now I told you not to use me as an excuse,

87
00:04:58,159 --> 00:04:59,390
you're speechless, huh?

88
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,950
So it's all my fault then?

89
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,270
I... I didn't say that.

90
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,590
Though up till this moment,

91
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:14,150
I'm still suspicious of you.

92
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:15,830
I don't quite understand

93
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,550
why you came into my life.

94
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,390
What was your true purpose?

95
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,480
But just like a lamp goes out when a person dies.

96
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,710
Now that you're gone,

97
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,950
I owe you in the end.

98
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:29,500
Ji Tanyin,

99
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,720
if there's an afterlife,

100
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,750
remember to stay far away from me.

101
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:41,150
What's so difficult about that?

102
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:42,340
Just say you are exceptionally gifted,

103
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,310
with your heart on the right side.

104
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,920
Or that you've practiced the art of feigning death.

105
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,430
Or perhaps,

106
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,830
you accidentally ate a divine fruit in childhood,

107
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:47,560
received divine visions,

108
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,230
blessings,

109
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:48,860
protections,

110
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:49,390
and so on and so forth.

111
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,310
There are plenty of excuses anyway.

112
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,590
He can't verify any of them.

113
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,190
Good idea.

114
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:56,800
I'll do it then.

115
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:00,990
What's wrong?

116
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,110
I suddenly feel uneasy.

117
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:07,190
I have a bad feeling.

118
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,230
Search.

119
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:25,750
Rest in peace.

120
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,470
I'm going back now.

121
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:40,350
It's too late.

122
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,550
Summon the wind, spread the clouds, bring the rain.

123
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,590
Did you foresee that it would rain today?

124
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:58,150
I'm not good at this.

125
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,310
You'd better hurry back.

126
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:15,950
I'm leaving now.

127
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:29,550
Why is it you again?

128
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,270
I must find my mother,

129
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,940
no matter the cost.

130
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,110
Let me ask you something.

131
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:36,040
Even if you find your mother,

132
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,870
what then?

133
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,110
Will she go back with you?

134
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,310
She's just a woman.

135
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,430
How could she possibly

136
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,550
evade the guards' eyes

137
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:43,909
and escape from this hidden town?

138
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,190
And besides,

139
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,670
at her age,

140
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:48,310
having given birth to so many children,

141
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,950
in this freezing weather,

142
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,070
she probably wouldn't even make it down Mountain Wu

143
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,950
before freezing to death.

144
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,190
And even if

145
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,630
you two managed to escape,

146
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:58,670
what good would it do?

147
00:07:58,830 --> 00:07:59,920
Who would accept you?

148
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:01,470
As long as the Youhu Clan exists,

149
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:02,790
if the High Priest doesn't die,

150
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,590
our clan will always be

151
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:06,270
rats in the gutter.

152
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,360
Squeak, squeak,

153
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:10,790
just scraping by to survive, nothing more.

154
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:12,740
Then what should I do?

155
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:13,870
What can you do?

156
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,630
Well, well...

157
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,460
Why don't you go and beg the clan leader?

158
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,550
Perhaps,

159
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:31,910
she'll be willing to show mercy.

160
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:33,970
Will she?

161
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:35,070
Maybe.

162
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,470
The fragrance fills the heavens and earth,

163
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:55,070
lighting up incense through the Gate of Heaven.

164
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,350
With the scent stretching thousands of miles,

165
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:00,500
I offer prayers from afar, invoking the true deity to appear at this altar.

166
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,990
Chieftain of the War Demon Clan.

167
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:23,070
You are a deity?

168
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:36,230
I am the 75th-generation chieftain of the War Demon Clan.

169
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,150
Li Chaoyang.

170
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:38,990
Paying homage to the deity.

171
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:43,910
The War Demon Clan was once a divine race.

172
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:46,670
They were banished from the Divine Realm for their transgressions.

173
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:50,160
It's been only 3,000 years since then.

174
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:53,190
Yet each generation has become weaker than the last.

175
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,390
Not even the perfect body of a battle demon

176
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,790
has ever been achieved.

177
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:58,020
And yet, you've managed to ascend to

178
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,430
the position of the War Demon Clan's chieftain.

179
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,680
It's due to my foolishness

180
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,970
that I have been unable to overcome obstacles

181
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,540
and achieve the perfect War Demon.

182
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,510
But our clan has acknowledged its mistakes.

183
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,350
We beg for the deity's mercy.

184
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:12,470
Please guide our entire clan back to the divine realm.

185
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:19,230
And kill the High Priest of the Youhu Clan.

186
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,750
Then I will grant your request.

187
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,950
The High Priest

188
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:29,150
owes our clan a mountain of blood debt.

189
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,550
Even if the you hadn't mentioned it,

190
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,230
I also wish to kill him to settle the score.

191
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:36,390
But alas, he possesses the Divine Left Hand.

192
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:38,660
We are no match for him.

193
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,150
This blade is called God Slayer.

194
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,430
It is imbued with

195
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:17,790
the most vengeful and murderous intent in this world.

196
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:21,020
Pierce his heart with this,

197
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,210
and he will surely die.

198
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:24,630
Yes.

199
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,470
Ding Xu just summoned all the elders,

200
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,030
but no one responded.

201
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,780
They all declared they were going into seclusion.

202
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,470
But secretly, they sent their disciples

203
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:50,550
to pay respects to Xinyao.

204
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,550
However, they couldn't even

205
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:52,470
enter the gate of Medicine Valley.

206
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,060
They are now in a state of anxiety,

207
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,470
partly because of the War Demons,

208
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:56,600
and on the other hand,

209
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:58,340
they fear you'll settle the score later.

210
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:03,110
You don't need to inform me about such matters in the future.

211
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,150
You don't need to investigate deliberately either.

212
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:07,870
Now, apart from me,

213
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:09,120
there are four other weapon spirits of the Divine Hand

214
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,070
scattered in the outside world.

215
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:10,830
Shouldn't we

216
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:11,990
retrieve them now?

217
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,110
Baitou Mountain is the closest to us.

218
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,030
Are you thinking about Kai Shan?

219
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:20,590
I miss him.

220
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,110
Alright.

221
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,870
Then let's go to Baitou Mountain first.

222
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:26,230
Get ready

223
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:27,470
to depart in three days.

224
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,350
Okay.

225
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:53,190
In this world, I now have

226
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:54,490
only one mission.

227
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,820
It is to be with you.

228
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,430
Until your hair turns gray,

229
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:00,670
and your teeth fall out.

230
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:03,470
For a lifetime no matter what

231
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,350
I want you to be happy.

232
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,080
I am the person who believes in you the most.

233
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,470
I am the one who, in your lifetime,

234
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,830
will never betray you.

235
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:22,510
Fool.

236
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:34,330
[Tomb of Ji Tanyin]

237
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:22,700
High...

238
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,150
Didn't you just leave?

239
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,310
Why are you back again?

240
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,850
It seems I've died again.

241
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,710
It's one thing for mortals not to worship gods,

242
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:46,590
but is killing gods now in fashion?

243
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,430
What caused your death this time?

244
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:50,910
Yuanzhong killed me.

245
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,110
You killed her!

246
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:53,580
How could you kill her?

247
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,930
I didn't mean to.

248
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:57,350
She suddenly appeared.

249
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,820
And I had been drinking.

250
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,670
Ji Tanyin,

251
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:01,190
you're so unfortunate.

252
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:01,910
You barely

253
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,720
escaped death at the hands of Dingxu,

254
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,630
only to die at the hands of Yuanzhong.

255
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:06,230
How am I supposed to

256
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:07,550
avenge you now?

257
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:10,320
Wasn't she dead before?

258
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,310
How is she alive again?

259
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:13,790
How could I know?

260
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,310
What do we do now?

261
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:16,900
Let's bury her again.

262
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,170
For his sake, you

263
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:22,860
were imprisoned in the Ice Prison for 200 years,

264
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,950
even offending the deities from the Thunder Clan.

265
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,470
Is this how he repays you?

266
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:27,790
He's become suspicious of you.

267
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,150
Not exactly.

268
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:31,190
It seemed like

269
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:33,870
he mistook me for an assassin.

270
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,540
He thought you were an assassin?

271
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,310
Anyway, it's not his fault.

272
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:38,670
I'll be going now.

273
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,110
Your primordial spirit is on fire!

274
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:57,930
What's going on?

275
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:58,950
The firewood has all burned up,

276
00:15:58,950 --> 00:15:59,990
but she's unharmed.

277
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:03,750
It seems her resurrection

278
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,270
is no coincidence.

279
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:08,550
In this world, only the War Demons

280
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,430
have such a powerful bloodline.

281
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,310
It's said they come from the Divine Realm,

282
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:14,510
and were once divine beings.

283
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,390
They need to awaken their bloodline

284
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,590
between life and death,

285
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,620
to achieve the perfect War Demon form.

286
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,470
For them, death

287
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,230
is merely a form of cultivation.

288
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:26,790
If she really is a War Demon,

289
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,710
why would she save you?

290
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,470
I wouldn't have died without her anyway.

291
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:33,740
Truly a headache-inducing situation.

292
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,020
Then I'll go bury her.

293
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:35,870
Wait.

294
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:47,470
How do you feel?

295
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,030
Seems like I'm fine now.

296
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,200
It's alright, it's alright.

297
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,540
Being burnt alive

298
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,510
would be such a disgrace.

299
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:56,790
Once this matter is settled,

300
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:57,900
you must diligently practice

301
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,270
and toughen up your physical body.

302
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,710
No divine body

303
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:02,190
is as weak as yours.

304
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:03,620
Without your primordial spirit,

305
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,069
you're just like a mortal.

306
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,069
It was just an accident.

307
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,270
It's okay.

308
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,829
I'm a deity after all.

309
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,270
Since I could become a god,

310
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,710
I must have pretty good luck.

311
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:21,670
You are being superfluous.

312
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:22,270
She's already dead.

313
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,390
Is this really necessary?

314
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,670
I... I...

315
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:42,750
What's happening to me?

316
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:43,990
It must be your physical body

317
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,590
getting into trouble in the mortal realm again.

318
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:46,990
Quickly, return your primordial spirit.

319
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,340
[Liujiao Palace]

320
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,330
It's me, it's me, it's me.

321
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,550
Do you want to kill me again?

322
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:46,910
Coming, coming.

323
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:49,550
Here, drink this medicine.

324
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:51,550
Drink it.

325
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,520
Thank you.

326
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:03,630
You're not dead.

327
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,350
Yes, I'm not dead.

328
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,270
Still alive.

Are you disappointed?

00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:11,820
Don't say that.

331
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:13,310
Since you died.

332
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,550
Yuanzhong was heartbroken.

333
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:15,590
He couldn't eat or drink.

334
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:16,750
He didn't sleep all night.

335
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:17,630
Really?

336
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:18,390
Really.

337
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:20,230
And about last night,

338
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,510
you can't blame Yuan Zhong.

339
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:22,470
You came back in such a furtive manner,

340
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:23,590
like a thief.

341
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:24,510
You happened to run into Yuanzhong.

If it were me,

343
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:26,510
I would have killed you as well.

344
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:27,390
Then why did you

345
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:28,910
seal me in ice?

346
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:31,190
It's...

347
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:33,430
It's because...

348
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,070
Ice burial.

349
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:36,270
Yes.

It's our Youhu Clan's

highest-level funeral.

352
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:39,910
Only those of noble status

353
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:41,590
can be buried this way.

354
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:43,270
We couldn't bear to part with you,

355
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:44,390
and couldn't save you,

356
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:45,190
so we sealed you

357
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:46,480
in that ice lake.

358
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:48,240
to preserve your youth

359
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,190
and keep your body from decay.

360
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,180
When we miss you occasionally,

361
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,510
we can still go and visit you.

362
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:59,110
I was wrong yesterday.

363
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,230
I shouldn't have acted rashly.

364
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:01,620
I apologize to you.

365
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:04,870
Never mind.

00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,390
It's good that you know your mistake.

367

However,

368
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:09,670
your seal has been broken.

369
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,470
The power of the Divine Hand is not to be underestimated.

370
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:13,070
You can't use it recklessly anymore.

371
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:14,700
Yes.

372
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,400
The Divine Hand's power is too strong.

373
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,790
So there's one thing I don't understand.

374
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:19,670
What?

375
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:21,070
Why are you still alive?

00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,230
have clearly checked.

378
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:26,150
Your heart meridian was severed, and there was no sign of life.

379
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,710
That's why we buried you.

380
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,390
Then why are you still alive?

381
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,070
Well...

382
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:33,630
There's something you don't know.

383
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:35,000
I'm uniquely gifted.

384
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:36,990
My heart is on the right side.

385
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:37,710
So even

386
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:38,990
Elder Dingxu's strike

387
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:40,460
didn't hit the vital spot.

388
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,910
Dingxu didn't hit a vital spot,

389
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,030
and neither did I?

390
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:44,680
Under the strike of the Divine Hand,

391
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,950
not to mention having your heart on the right side,

392
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:46,990
even if your entire body was made of hearts,

393
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:47,950
you would be dead for sure.

394
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:50,070
I've practiced the art of feigning death since childhood.

395
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:52,490
I'm able to preserve life by feigning death.

396
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:53,740
And also,

397
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,830
I once accidentally ate

398
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:55,910
a divine fruit that fell from the sky.

399
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,160
After eating it, I slept for a long time.

400
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,510
When I woke up again,

401
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:01,270
I possessed infinite power.

402
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:03,350
My body also became indestructible.

403
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:04,430
Anything else?

404
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,100
Yes.

405
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:07,190
I often have dreams from the deities.

406
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:08,190
They often appear in my dreams,

407
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:09,190
blessing me

408
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:11,350
and promise to protect me for life.

409
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:13,720
They say they'll cure all my illnesses

410
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,710
and grant me longevity.

411
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:17,470
Why am I not dead,

412
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:19,310
you seem quite unhappy about it.

413
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:21,350
Have you been hoping for my death?

414
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,230
I'm just being curious, that's all.

415
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:27,870
Anyway,

416
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,240
I'm glad you're alright.

417
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:30,710
You must be hungry.

418
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,070
I'm not hungry.

419
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:33,390
You haven't eaten for days.

420
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:34,350
How can you not be hungry?

421
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,510
Go freshen up first.

422
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:36,870
I'll have some food sent over.

423
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:37,910
High Priest,

424
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:39,430
you're so kind to me.

425
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,060
You really are a good person.

426
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,070
No need to be polite.

427
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,070
After all, you got into this trouble

428
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,430
because you were trying to save me.

429
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:46,710
Go on then.

430
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:58,350
How is it?

431
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:00,270
She's gone back to her room.

432
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,340
She's meditating and resting.

433
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:02,990
Yuanzhong, you were so right.

434
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,590
This woman is too mysterious.

435
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,750
Even the Divine Left Hand couldn't kill her.

436
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:10,260
Could she be from the War Demon royal family?

437
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:12,920
Although she's formidable,

438
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:14,540
at least she's not very smart.

439
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:16,910
So what's our next move?

440
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:17,740
Let's go.

441
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,470
Go?

442
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:19,810
Didn't you want to find Kaishan?

443
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,750
Let's leave right now.

444
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:21,510
We'll go far away

445
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:22,790
and leave this trouble to Dingxu.

446
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:23,980
Alright.

447
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:29,090
[Youhu]

448
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:29,230
Greetings, High Priest.

449
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,540
Mr. Tanghua,

450
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,190
The High Priest just left the mountain.

451
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,340
The High Priest has left?

452
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:50,390
All by himself?

453
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:52,310
The attendant Zifei from the Liujiao Palace

454
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,590
went with him.

455
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:55,160
I see.

456
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:04,350
Young Master,

457
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:06,590
Where did the High Priest go?

458
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:09,190
Zifei is the weapon spirit of the Divine Left Hand.

459
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:10,950
Besides him,

460
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,350
there are four other weapon spirits

461
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:14,390
that were sealed away with Yuanzhong back then.

462
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:16,100
They're just scattered in different places.

463
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:18,670
I guess Yuanzhong has gone to find

464
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:20,030
those four weapon spirits.

465
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,110
What should we do then?

466
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,270
Should we follow them?

467
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:24,710
I'll go.

468
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:27,030
You stay on the mountain and keep an eye on Dingxu.

469
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:28,950
Be ready to heed my call at any time.

470
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:30,750
Yes.

471
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:43,480
Grand Elder,

472
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:45,750
The High Priest left the mountain.

473
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:49,110
Where is he going?

474
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:49,990
I'm not sure.

475
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:51,350
It's just him and Zifei.

476
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:52,630
They're carrying a big bundle.

477
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:54,810
It looks like they're leaving for good.

478
00:23:59,150 --> 00:23:59,950
Grand Elder,

479
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:02,670
don't you find this suspicious?

480
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,540
Even if the War Demon is still alive,

481
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:05,780
they shouldn't have been able to

482
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,150
target you so precisely.

483
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:09,540
And the seal has been broken.

484
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,500
yet he left so quietly.

485
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,590
Don't you find it strange?

486
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:16,310
Indeed.

487
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:22,440
It's very strange.

488
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:28,790
High Priest.

489
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:34,350
High Priest, are you in there?

490
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,300
Where did he go?

491
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,740
Stop staring. You might attract something else.

492
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,390
Yuanzhong.

493
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:22,550
Here...

494
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,030
She comes...

495
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,340
Yuanzhong, wait for me!

496
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:27,710
Yuanzhong, wait for me!

497
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:32,950
Let's split up.

498
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:33,850
Meet at the ferry dock.

499
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,270
Okay.

500
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:49,590
Where are you going?

501
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,070
Didn't we agree?

502
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:56,070
No matter where you go,

503
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:57,470
I'd stay by your side.

504
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,310
How could you do this?

505
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:59,190
You just left

506
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,470
without even saying a word.

507
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,260
I don't blame you.

508
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:15,310
But now,

509
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,430
where are we going?

510
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,150
Did you never

511
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:22,540
intend to bring me along?

512
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:25,750
Are you doubting me?

513
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,950
You know exactly what's going on,

514
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:29,710
Why pretend to be clueless?

515
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,780
What do I know?

516
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,510
Still pretending.

517
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:39,510
A mere spy from the War Demon Clan

518
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:41,350
dares to infiltrate my inner circle.

519
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:42,300
What a joke.

520
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:43,910
When I wiped out your entire clan back then,

521
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:45,440
you didn't even know where you were.

522
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:46,870
If you want to scheme against me,

523
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:48,470
you'll have to wait a long time.

524
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,150
I'm not from the War Demon Clan.

525
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:51,550
Is that so?

526
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,810
You could be a bit more sincere.

527
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,750
Are you from Wushan?

528
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:56,950
From Laofeng?

529
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:58,200
Or from Hemo?

530
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,240
I don't know what you're talking about.

531
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:01,620
Then tell me,

532
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:03,430
where are you from?

533
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:06,030
I have two answers.

534
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:07,030
But I can't tell you

535
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:08,110
one of them.

536
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,200
Isn't it the true one

537
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,270
that you can't tell me?

538
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,160
This is too much.

539
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:21,290
I can't fly.

540
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:23,870
Well, that's just great.

541
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:51,670
Why are you back again?

542
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,070
I just don't understand.

543
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,640
Is the mortal world so dangerous

544
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,510
that it makes a dignified fifth-rank deity

545
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:58,230
die over and over again?

546
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:01,030
I'm afraid of backlash,

547
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:02,870
so I dare not use my divine power.

548
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:04,670
I Relied only on craftsmanship and martial skills,

549
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:06,470
that's why his sneak attack succeeded.

550
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:08,790
But this will absolutely be the last time.

551
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:11,190
I think we should just forget it.

552
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,310
Let him fend for himself.

553
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:15,340
He won't live much longer anyway.

554
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,640
We can retrieve the Divine Hand after he dies.

555
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,570
Why go to such great lengths?

556
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:22,450
If you die a few more times like this,

557
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:24,470
I'm afraid your divine source will collapse directly,

558
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:25,790
and you'll vanish into thin air.

559
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:27,470
No way.

560
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:29,550
He killed me twice.

561
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:31,110
Twice, do you understand?

562
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:31,970
So what?

563
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,270
So I don't know if he's

564
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:35,990
a good person or a bad person.

565
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:37,440
If he's a bad person,

566
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:39,350
I'll kill him immediately and take back the hand.

567
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:41,340
But if he's a good person,

568
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:42,750
I'd have to stay by his side

569
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:43,510
for a lifetime,

570
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:45,300
until he dies and I can retrieve the Divine Hand,

571
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:46,570
So that I can fulfill my promise.

572
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:48,700
What's the point?

573
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,000
Why bother?

574
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:59,350
The deity was right.

575
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:01,260
I am a sinner.

576
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:02,670
As the clan leader,

577
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:05,060
I still can't comprehend the great way

578
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:07,000
to achieve the perfect War Demon body.

579
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:09,910
If my father were still here,

580
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:12,130
our War Ghost Clan

581
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,310
wouldn't be in this situation today.

582
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:15,670
Clan leader,

583
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:16,630
please don't...

584
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:19,110
In the past,

585
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,960
the High Priest had Divine Hand.

586
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:23,630
and we couldn't do anything against him.

587
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:25,390
But now,

588
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:28,030
the deity has bestowed upon me a divine weapon.

589
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:32,430
With this god-slaying dagger,

590
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:37,170
even if it costs me my life,

591
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:39,270
I will kill him.

592
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:56,710
Where are you going?

593
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:59,350
Go back and tell the clan leader

594
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:00,190
that I, Qian Lin,

595
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:01,150
will take the head of

596
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,430
the High Priest for her.

597
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:04,270
As long as she agrees to let me take my mother away.

598
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:08,310
Come on,

599
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:09,550
give me that.

600
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:13,830
Stubborn and unrepentant.

601
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:35,870
You can't escape, you know.

602
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:36,870
Come back with me

603
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:38,470
to ask for forgiveness from the clan leader.

604
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:39,370
Ask for forgiveness?

605
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:41,870
Asking for forgiveness won't save my life.

606
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:43,190
Besides, this kind of life,

607
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:44,270
I've had enough of it.

608
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,390
Let the head of the high priest

609
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:46,590
of the Fox Clan

610
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,000
help reunite my family.

611
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,870
Stop talking nonsense and give me the item quickly.

612
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:51,960
Or don't blame me for being impolite.

613
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:58,870
Stop!

614
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:06,550
Are you alright?

615
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:07,750
I'm fine, Captain.

616
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:43,100
May I ask you all,

617
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:44,440
how to get to Hulukou?

618
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:50,190
I wish to sail to Hulukou,

619
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:51,820
but encountered this place on the way.

620
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,950
The sandstorm was too strong,

621
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:53,970
and I lost my way.

622
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:55,950
If you know the way,

623
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:57,470
I hope you could kindly help.

624
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:00,870
Go south for twenty li,

625
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,710
and you'll see an oasis.

626
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:05,540
Pass through the oasis and go upstream,

627
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:06,730
it's only five li more,

628
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:08,830
and you'll see a riverbank.

629
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:09,980
[Du He, merchant of human race]

630
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:10,550
That's Hulukou.

631
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:12,670
I thought

632
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,010
I had to keep going west.

633
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:14,990
Thank you very much.

634
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,850
You're welcome, sir.

635
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:18,000
When traveling,

636
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,230
helping others is helping yourself.

637
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:22,630
That's well said.

638
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:23,590
Farewell.

639
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:24,630
Please wait, sir.

640
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:28,540
Here, have some water first.

641
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:31,780
Judging by your attire,

642
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:33,030
you don't seem to be from around here.

643
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:34,550
May I ask your name?

644
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:35,750
My surname is Yuan,

645
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:36,830
I'm from Pingzhou.

646
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:39,350
Oh, so you're Young Master Yuan.

647
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:42,370
Pingzhou is indeed quite far.

648
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:43,390
Yuan from 'yuanbao'.

649
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:45,180
So this is how you've come all this way.

650
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,070
Yes, indeed.

651
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:48,230
The journey is difficult.

652
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:50,620
Be extra careful as you travel alone.

653
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:51,510
Thank you.

654
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:54,110
Farewell.

655
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:54,830
Farewell.

656
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:20,580
Yuanzhong.

657
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:23,219
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

658
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:24,230
You've finally arrived.

659
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:25,830
I lost my way midway.

660
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:27,179
I took quite a few wrong turns.

661
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:28,310
Getting lost?

662
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:29,790
Your bad luck has begun?

663
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:31,929
It seems so.

664
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:34,830
Where's Ji Tanyin?

665
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:35,639
I shook her off.

666
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:39,030
The ones at the back, keep up!

667
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:44,230
Young Master Yuan,

668
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:45,830
here we are again.

669
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:48,449
Had I known you were also taking this tower ship,

670
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,960
I should have traveled with you.

671
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:52,520
Please.

672
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:53,510
Please.

673
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:06,590
You two,

674
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:07,470
quickly load these onto the ship.

675
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:08,110
Okay.

676
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:11,020
Be gentle with the cargo, everyone.

677
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:11,790
Okay, okay.

678
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,070
Young man,

679
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,750
[Manager Cao of human race]

680
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:17,990
young man.

681
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:40,070
The river here has dried up.

682
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:41,340
How can we sail?

683
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:43,830
Young Master Yuan, you may not know,

684
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:44,880
this tower ship

685
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,790
doesn't travel on water.

686
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,820
Set sail!

687
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:13,550
This ship is actually flying!

688
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:16,540
Is it your first time

689
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:17,750
to ride a tower ship?

690
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:19,510
Over the years,

691
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,910
our Human Clan craftsmanship has greatly improved.

692
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:22,910
Riding the clouds and mist,

693
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:24,670
flying in the sky and burrowing underground

694
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:26,360
are no longer exclusive to

695
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,150
the Youhu Clan immortals.

696
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,060
Indeed.

697
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:31,550
Truly extraordinary.

698
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:32,810
Manager Cao,

699
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,280
you're being too kind.

700
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:35,750
We don't even know who this person is,

701
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:36,920
yet you saved him.

702
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,230
Since we encountered him,

703
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:40,590
how could we just leave him there?

704
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:43,020
Look at how young he is.

705
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:44,430
If something were to happen to him,

706
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:45,670
what would we do?

707
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:49,790
What's wrong?

708
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:50,430
This...

709
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,740
The wound is healing by itself.

710
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:17,450
Yes, I saw it with my own eyes.

711
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:18,400
Such a long gash,

712
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,510
healed in an instant.

713
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:29,070
Young Mistress Dai,

714
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:31,530
you didn't make it to this ship after all.

715
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:36,240
Sir,

716
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:39,030
what is it?

717
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:41,310
Sir, to report,

718
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:42,140
it seems a War Demon has snuck aboard.

719
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:43,670
on our ship.

720
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:46,390
Where did this War Demon come from?

721
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:48,470
How was their identity confirmed?

722
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:49,970
Sir,

723
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,510
when I was at Hulukou,

724
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:52,350
I found

725
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:53,970
a severely injured, unconscious young man.

726
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:54,790
Feeling pity for him,

727
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:55,990
I brought him back with us.

728
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:57,430
When the doctor was treating him,

729
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:58,190
We found him.

730
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:00,680
His wounds healed rapidly.

731
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,030
We arrived a step too late.

732
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:04,700
He injured one of our boatmen

733
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:05,670
and managed to escape.

734
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,190
Sir,

735
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:08,590
the descendant of Youhu Clan

736
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:09,710
seems to be true.

737
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:11,480
The War Demon is still alive.

738
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:13,550
What should we do?

739
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,050
Search the ship.

740
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:18,660
Find him for me.

741
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:19,970
Yes, sir.

742
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:28,710
This tower ship cost a fortune to build.

743
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:30,080
It's lavishly decorated,

744
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:32,140
with all amenities for eating, drinking, and entertainment.

745
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,950
It's essentially

746
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:36,350
a small flying town.

747
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:38,620
In this world, only

748
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:39,510
we are capable of such feats,

749
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:40,950
the craftsmanship of Human Clan.

750
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:42,520
No matter how impressive our craftsmanship is,

751
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:43,470
it can't compare to

752
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:44,760
the magic of immortals.

753
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,910
This tower ship used to burn coal,

754
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:48,550
constantly emitting black smoke,

755
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:50,630
and it would fly erratically, up and down.

756
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:51,630
That was quite frightening.

757
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:53,310
Since switching to crystal stones

758
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:54,750
and using spirit-gathering chambers for propulsion, it's been much better.

759
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:56,190
It's clean and quiet,

760
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:57,750
but most importantly, it flies smoothly,

761
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:59,150
giving passengers peace of mind.

762
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,820
Make way, make way!

763
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:05,950
What's going on?

764
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:07,990
I heard there's a criminal on board.

765
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:09,500
They're searching everywhere.

766
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:11,070
When I came by,

767
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:13,150
they had already searched the lower cabins.

768
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:14,910
Young Master Yuan,

769
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:16,950
I have matters to attend to. I'll take my leave now.

770
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,870
They're searching for a criminal on the ship.

771
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:23,270
Why is he so nervous?

772
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:26,650
Do you know that humans have a weapon

773
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:28,110
called 'flying fire'?

774
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:29,910
It's made from sulfur and other materials.

775
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:32,950
Though small, it can split mountains and crack rocks.

776
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:34,060
Its power is extraordinary.

777
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:35,110
Yes,

778
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:36,910
humans have been researching craftsmanship for years,

779
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:37,990
and indeed have created many

780
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:39,670
weapons for siege warfare.

781
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:41,350
Tell me,

782
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:43,990
if we use that flying fire to blow up the spirit gathering chamber,

783
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,550
would this tower ship

784
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:47,630
fall from the sky?

785
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,030
What do you mean?

786
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:02,510
Yuanzhong,

787
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,230
it seems Ji Tanyin is indeed the War Demon.

788
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:06,350
You're in trouble.

789
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:14,910
Sir,

790
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:15,830
what's the situation?

791
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:17,840
Who are the guards on the tower ship looking for?

792
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,420
A young man,

793
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:20,740
about seventeen or eighteen years old.

794
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,310
It shouldn't have anything to do with us.

795
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:24,070
Have the guards searched here?

796
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:25,910
They just came by,

797
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:26,860
but I've already

798
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:27,910
managed to fob them off.

799
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,110
Can you ensure that they

800
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:30,710
won't come back?

801
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:32,090
You said

802
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:33,990
that hiding things here would be absolutely safe.

803
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:35,190
If someone discovers it,

804
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:36,260
all will be lost.

805
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:38,610
What should we do now?

806
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:43,510
Leave the barrel to divert attention,

807
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:45,040
but move the flying fire immediately.

808
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:45,910
Alright.

809
00:40:57,490 --> 00:40:58,300
Wait.

810
00:40:58,670 --> 00:40:59,470
What's wrong?

811
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:43,090
A Xue.

812
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:45,180
Why aren't you serving in the cabin?

813
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,270
Are you slacking off again?

814
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,030
Be careful not to get caught by the supervisor.

815
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:49,110
They might dock your pay.

816
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,920
I'm not slacking off at all.

817
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:51,550
I've been in the kitchen,

818
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,030
peeling beans all day.

819
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:54,110
Alright.

820
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:21,030
Hello.
