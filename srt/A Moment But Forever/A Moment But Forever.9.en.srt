[A Moment But Forever]

00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,250
[Episode 9]

3
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:04,950
Hello.

4
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,940
Have you bought the ticket?

5
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:12,510
Are you still planning to buy one?

6
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:13,620
Yes.

7
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,030
I'm not a bad person.

8
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:21,620
I'm just here to find someone.

9
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,300
You won't report me, will you?

10
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:30,740
Really?

11
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,380
My name is Tanyin.

12
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,579
I'm your fellow villager and neighbor.

13
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,079
We're good friends,

14
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,510
the best kind.

15
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,220
You're Tanyin,

16
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,270
my fellow villager and neighbor.

17
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,510
We're good friends,

18
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:50,950
the best kind.

19
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:53,510
Xue,

20
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:56,630
this is my hometown friend Tanyin,

21
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,180
a good friend I grew up with,

22
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,270
the best kind.

23
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:02,350
Here.

24
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,630
Take a look.

25
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:06,950
How is it?

26
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:10,630
It's pretty good, right?

27
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:13,870
From now on,

28
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,270
you can stay at my place.

29
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,670
No need to trouble you.

30
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:22,310
How can you say that?

31
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,310
We're good friends,

32
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:25,790
the best kind.

33
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:27,190
Since we've met,

34
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,590
there's no reason for you to leave.

35
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:29,790
Just listen to me

36
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:30,780
and stay here.

37
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:43,870
It's you who killed Ji Tanyin,

38
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,790
but why am I the one getting the bad luck?

39
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,550
My misfortune is your misfortune.

40
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:51,310
What's the difference?

41
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:53,990
Luckily,

42
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,190
I was prepared.

43
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:01,950
Wait,

44
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,510
how did it get lost too?

45
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:07,190
Yuanzhong,

46
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,590
I told you before that

47
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,550
Ji Tanyin could

48
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,030
being able to survive under the Divine Left Hand

49
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,400
means her bloodline is not ordinary.

50
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,770
The War Demon was once a member of the divine race.

51
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,110
Killing her

52
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:17,740
is like killing a god.

53
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,779
There's always a price for that.

54
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,870
The War Demon was already

55
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:21,910
exiled from the Divine Realm.

56
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,430
What kind of divine race is that?

57
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:24,950
Don't worry.

58
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,700
It'll be fine after a while.

59
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:28,950
After the Battle of Pinghu back then,

60
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,470
you were unlucky for many years.

61
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:32,390
Many War Demons

62
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,670
died in the Battle of Pinghu.

63
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,350
How can Ji Tanyin alone

64
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,750
be compared to them?

65
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:37,980
That's different.

66
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,430
This divine retribution has struck with overwhelming force.

67
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,870
You'd better do some good deeds

68
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:43,980
and build up some merit

69
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,190
to lessen the consequences.

70
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,230
Where are you going?

71
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,110
To make some money.

72
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,190
Accountant Liu,

73
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,310
can you read this for me?

74
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:57,950
It's a letter

75
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:58,990
from my little brother.

76
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,950
I've got a lot to do here,

77
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:01,630
let's do it tomorrow.

78
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,310
You said yesterday

79
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,310
that you'd read it to me today.

80
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:04,070
Tomorrow.

81
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:08,630
Come here.

82
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:09,550
I?

83
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:10,510
Yes, come here.

84
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:13,680
Let me read it for you.

85
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,420
This... This is too much trouble.

86
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,260
It's no trouble.

87
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,190
Greetings, elder brother.

88
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:26,710
It's been months since we last met,

89
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,180
and I miss you very much.

90
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,270
Everything at home is as usual.

91
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,470
Our parents are in good health.

92
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:34,560
Little sister has grown taller.

93
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:37,310
Uncle Hui's tailoring shop is expanding,

94
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,390
and he took me on as an apprentice.

95
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,909
I'll work hard to learn the craft

96
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,860
and take care of father, mother, and little sister.

97
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:45,950
Brother, don't worry.

98
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:48,790
The old yellow dog at home is getting old...

99
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,190
I'm going to work now.

100
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,630
Stay in the room and don't wander around.

101
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:50,790
You don't have a ticket,

102
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:51,990
and you might get caught.

103
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:53,909
I'll go buy a ticket later.

104
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:55,630
With me around,

105
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,350
why waste your money on that?

106
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,230
Be good, okay?

107
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,590
I'll bring you something tasty when I come back.

108
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:00,790
I'm off.

109
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,070
Grandpa,

110
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:25,910
is the Grudge Bird fiercer than an eagle?

111
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,470
If you really compare them,

112
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:30,310
the eagle

113
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:32,430
is like a little bunny—so gentle.

114
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:33,390
It's no match

115
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,430
for the Grudge Bird.

116
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:37,630
That sounds so impressive.

117
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:39,030
I'd love to have one.

118
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:42,670
The Grudge Bird, according to legends,

119
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,030
is formed from the resentment

120
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,150
on the Pinghu battlefield.

121
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,220
It's the embodiment of the dead War Demon.

122
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,030
It's not so easy to tame.

123
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,990
If it smells blood,

124
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,070
it'll swoop down

125
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,110
and eat us both,

126
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,750
leaving nothing but bone fragments.

127
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:55,630
I'm not afraid.

128
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,510
We have the craftsman uncle on the ship.

129
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,909
Mom said that our clan's craftsmanship is the best—

130
00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:01,430
we'll definitely be able to kill them.

131
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:03,710
It's not that easy.

132
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,630
It's said that the Grudge Bird

133
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,990
is over a person tall,

134
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,030
fast,

135
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,550
and tough.

136
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,220
They're really hard to kill.

137
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,910
Its body may be tough,

138
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,910
but its head is extremely soft.

139
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,460
If you attack its head,

140
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:19,870
you can kill it.

141
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,910
Moreover, Grudge Birds are not

142
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,510
the transformed spirits of the deceased War Demons.

143
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,190
Instead, they are ordinary birds

144
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,710
that accidentally consumed the dense, lingering death energy

145
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:28,620
left after the Battle of Pinghu,

146
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,990
which turned them into what people now call

147
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:30,790
Grudge Bird.

148
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,470
I've learned something today.

149
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:40,110
Father, it's easy to catch a cold out here.

150
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,380
Why are you out here again?

151
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,190
The scenery is so beautiful...

152
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:48,510
I won't get to see much more of it.

153
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,470
Father, you're talking nonsense again.

154
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,310
Let's go back.

155
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:52,960
Alright.

156
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,260
Grandson, let's go.

157
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,430
Let me help you pick those up.

158
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,710
I'm sorry.

159
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:18,430
I'm sorry.

160
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,950
Never mind.

161
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,150
Here you are.

162
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,350
Thank you, Sir.

163
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,710
Thank you, Sir.

164
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,430
Let's go.

165
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:35,670
It's not that simple, huh?

166
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:37,030
You've run into such bad luck.

167
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:38,310
Could it be that Ji Tanyin is

168
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,070
the daughter of the leader of the War Demons?

169
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,590
I've even killed the leader of the War Demon before;

170
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:43,870
why would I be afraid of his daughter?

171
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,190
You'd better do some good deeds

172
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:47,200
to balance the backlash.

173
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:15,990
The guards on the tower ship

174
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,190
are looking for you,

175
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,270
aren't they?

176
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,670
My men are waiting for me to return.

177
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,080
If they realize

178
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,380
I've been gone too long,

179
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:24,850
they'll definitely come looking.

180
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:27,990
You won't be able to run then.

181
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,180
By then,

182
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,350
I'll kill you first.

183
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,310
Young man,

184
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:40,830
we have no conflict.

185
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,670
There's no need for this, right?

186
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,030
What are your conditions?

187
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,230
What's in here?

188
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:47,030
I'm not sure.

189
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,850
It's An's order.

190
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:51,030
He said it's cargo for a merchant group.

191
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,270
It's been checked already.

192
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:53,430
Where's An?

193
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:54,670
An?

194
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:57,190
I don't know. I haven't seen him.

195
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:58,830
Let's leave.

196
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,270
So you're afraid of being found out too, huh?

197
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,630
Neither of us are good people;

198
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:14,820
no need to scare me.

199
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:38,910
Who's used this water pouch

200
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:40,550
these past few days?

201
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,470
You haven't been spotted, have you?

202
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:48,150
Do they all know

203
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,350
I'm your fellow villager?

204
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:53,670
Do I have some face?

205
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:57,510
Yes, you do.

206
00:11:58,430 --> 00:11:59,630
Here, have some water.

207
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:03,910
What's wrong?

208
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:09,190
Do you remember I told you

209
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,910
I came on board to find someone?

210
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:16,720
That person

211
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,110
used to be really good to me,

212
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:21,910
so I always thought

213
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,110
he was a good person.

214
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:24,670
But later,

215
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,310
some things happened,

216
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:27,910
and I started to think

217
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,600
maybe he wasn't so good after all.

218
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,470
So what?

219
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:33,710
So,

220
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:35,950
I originally came to

221
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:37,270
settle things with him,

222
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,750
but then I noticed

223
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:40,350
he seems to treat everyone else

224
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,550
quite well.

225
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,110
And then?

226
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,190
Then,

227
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,830
I got a bit confused.

228
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,630
Is he a good person

229
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,270
or a bad person?

230
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:55,670
What's the big deal?

231
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,230
People change.

232
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:00,540
Someone

233
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,230
might do good today

234
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:03,550
and bad tomorrow.

235
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:04,360
We can't say he's

236
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,390
good today

237
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:06,790
and bad tomorrow.

238
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:08,220
You can't judge someone

239
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,710
based on just one thing.

240
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,470
It takes time to truly know someone's heart.

241
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:13,030
Take me for example.

242
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:14,630
You see me

243
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,710
cheerful every day, right?

244
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:19,470
But actually, I'm not

245
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:20,950
very happy here either.

246
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:22,750
If you're not happy,

247
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:24,070
why don't you leave?

248
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:28,910
My home is in Yandu,

249
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:30,940
where it's already hard to make a living.

250
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:32,230
Our house is small.

251
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:34,030
After my elder brother got married

252
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:35,260
and had a son,

253
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:36,540
they're still all sleeping in one room

254
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,150
even though my nephew's grown up now.

255
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,790
My mom hopes I'll marry soon

256
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,230
to free up space at home.

257
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:44,190
So when the tower ship was hiring,

258
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:45,310
I came here.

259
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:48,550
Do you resent your family for that?

260
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:52,270
I don't blame them.

261
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,870
My sister-in-law always scolds my elder brother

262
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:54,870
for being incompetent.

263
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,350
My parents are in poor health,

264
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:59,150
and he's the only one earning money.

265
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,270
It's actually quite tough for him.

266
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:05,030
Life is hard for everyone.

267
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:07,710
The powerful have their struggles,

268
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:08,910
and ordinary people

269
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,390
have theirs too.

270
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:13,070
Wait, that's not right.

271
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,870
Aren't you my neighbor?

272
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,470
How could you not know about my situation?

273
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,750
Of course I know.

274
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:21,600
I just

275
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,950
didn't recall it for a moment.

276
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,110
Here, have something to eat.

277
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,230
I prepared it especially for you.

278
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,580
It smells so good.

279
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,350
Doesn't it?

280
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,110
Once I

281
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,030
find the right man,

282
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:47,790
I'll have a home,

283
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:49,590
and I won't work on the tower ship anymore.

284
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,030
But with so many people on the ship,

285
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,990
isn't there anyone you like?

286
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,810
I guess the right one hasn't come yet.

287
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,390
It's not like there's no one at all.

288
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:06,280
Yesterday, a gentleman came on board.

289
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:08,780
He's kind,

290
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,150
good-looking,

291
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,460
and I quite like him.

292
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:14,310
What's so good about him?

293
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,550
He's just good—

294
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:17,830
friendly,

295
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:18,790
helpful,

296
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,500
and speaks in a gentle manner.

297
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:21,910
I heard from Uncle Guan that

298
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,380
last night

299
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:24,790
he even read letters from home for the crew.

300
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,710
He didn't charge them,

301
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:26,840
and was very patient.

302
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:29,110
But judging from his clothes and appearance,

303
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,870
he's clearly from a wealthy family.

304
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:32,510
He probably wouldn't fancy someone like me.

305
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:36,790
It seems like I and Mr. Yuan

306
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:38,630
just aren't meant to be.

307
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:40,790
Mr. Yuan?

308
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:42,510
Is his surname Yuan?

309
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:45,830
Does he

310
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:47,910
have an attendant

311
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,110
with him?

312
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:50,430
Yes, he does.

313
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:53,950
His attendant is also very good-looking.

314
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,030
Do you think

315
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:57,070
I'd be a good match for that attendant?

316
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:04,630
It's right there.

317
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,950
We've searched the entire tower ship.

318
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:06,630
Only this cabin

319
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:07,460
refuses to let us in.

320
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,710
I suspect the person is inside.

321
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,550
Go knock on the door.

322
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,590
What if he doesn't open it?

323
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:11,950
Then we'll break it down.

324
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:12,590
Yes.

325
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:18,510
Is anyone there?

326
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,190
We're the tower ship's guards.

327
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,430
We have urgent business.

328
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:22,830
Please open the door.

329
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,150
What exactly happened?

330
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:30,620
Here's the thing.

331
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:31,550
A guest on the ship

332
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,710
lost something valuable.

333
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:33,960
I suspect there's a thief on board.

334
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,350
You suspect I'm the thief?

335
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:37,860
That's not what I meant at all.

336
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,620
We just want to search around.

337
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:42,350
Search around?

338
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,390
This is Shen Ying's ship, isn't it?

339
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:47,790
Let him come and search himself.

340
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:49,230
No.

341
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,550
He's so rude...

342
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:51,670
He's Mr. Tanghua,

343
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:52,750
from the Youhu Clan.

344
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:55,030
Go!

345
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:55,760
Go!

346
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:02,830
Did you say Mr. Tanghua is on the ship?

347
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,550
Is he here to chase the medicine?

348
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:10,750
I don't think so.

349
00:17:13,869 --> 00:17:14,910
In any case,

350
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:17,390
he's the Commander of the Youhu Clan's War Division.

351
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,349
Since he's here,

352
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:21,390
we should at least show some hospitality.

353
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:22,630
Well,

354
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:24,349
prepare some gifts

355
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:25,430
and deliver them on my behalf.

356
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:27,829
While you're at it, try to gauge his intentions.

357
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:29,750
Yes.

358
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:39,750
Tanyin,

359
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:41,670
it's not that I don't agree,

360
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,160
but you said yourself

361
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,550
that he knows you.

362
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:46,070
If you go over like this,

363
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,910
won't you be recognized at a glance?

364
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:49,470
Don't worry.

365
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,670
I have my ways.

366
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,870
What's this?

367
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:55,350
It looks pretty nice.

368
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:56,340
Bear with it for a moment.

369
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,910
Why are you pinching me?

370
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:19,670
Tanyin!

371
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:20,710
You...

372
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,230
How did you turn into me?

373
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,150
I didn't turn into you.

374
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,870
It's just an illusion.

375
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:28,390
As long as I wear this,

376
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,570
others will

377
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,600
see me as you.

378
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,090
So magical!

379
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,910
Tanyin, have you become an immortal cultivator?

380
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:35,830
Are you a cultivator?

381
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,990
Is this magic?

382
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:39,670
It's not magic,

383
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,590
just a trick.

384
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:45,510
But you can't touch it.

385
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:46,790
If it gets rubbed off,

386
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:47,870
it won't work anymore.

387
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:49,900
Anyway, for now,

388
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,350
you stay here and rest.

389
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,750
I'll go out and work for you.

390
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,100
What are you going to do?

391
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:57,950
I want to see

392
00:18:58,670 --> 00:18:59,500
if he's really

393
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,710
as helpful as you say.

394
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:06,910
Sir.

395
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:08,510
How did it go?

396
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:10,390
Mr. Tanghua said

397
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:11,550
he doesn't need to be served

398
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,750
and doesn't want to be disturbed,

399
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:14,020
so he sent me back.

400
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:18,830
That's good.

401
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:22,350
Why what?

402
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:24,390
Why not stop you?

403
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:25,990
Weren't you trying to save me?

404
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,950
How could I ruin your plans?

405
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,350
Tanghua,

406
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,350
why are you still like this?

407
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:35,830
If you're going to act, be decisive.

408
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:38,230
If you're going to take a side, commit fully.

409
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:40,100
How can you lead the War Division

410
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,350
if you keep hesitating

411
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:43,270
and wavering like this?

412
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:53,870
Good morning, Xue.

413
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:54,510
Morning.

414
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,270
Xue, hurry up.

415
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:57,230
Everyone's waiting for you.

416
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,060
You're almost late.

417
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,020
I know, thank you.

418
00:19:59,020 --> 00:19:59,790
Hurry up!

419
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:12,270
Here.

420
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,550
Such a small wound.

421
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,510
Normally,

422
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:19,160
the Divine Left Hand could heal it instantly.

423
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:20,750
Yuanzhong,

424
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,220
you're in for some serious bad luck.

425
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:24,550
Ji Tanyin

426
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,270
is definitely no ordinary War Demon.

427
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,550
She must be someone of higher status

428
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:30,440
than the leader of the War Demon.

429
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,190
Higher than the clan leader?

430
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,150
Who could that be?

431
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,390
Maybe a saintess,

432
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:39,490
or a priestess who communicates with the gods.

433
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:40,570
Anyway, she's very powerful.

434
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,070
Yuanzhong,

435
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:44,230
killing her would be like killing a god.

436
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:45,590
You'll be rejected by the heavenly way

437
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,760
and face terrible misfortune.

438
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,630
Those War Demons

439
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:50,110
were expelled from the Divine Realm long ago.

440
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,410
If they count as gods,

441
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,230
then I've killed plenty of gods.

442
00:20:58,980 --> 00:20:59,790
Who is it?

443
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:01,430
The meal delivery.

444
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,500
What delicious food do we have today?

445
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,160
You'll know when you open it.

446
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:09,830
Come in.

447
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:13,270
Put it here.

448
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:31,790
How should I test him?

449
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:42,270
Do you have any troubles

450
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,100
that you need help with?

451
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:46,590
Do you have letters from home?

452
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:47,590
I can read them for you.

453
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:49,550
Well,

454
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:51,390
is there any work I can help you with?

455
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:57,550
Just pick up

456
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:58,640
the broken teacup pieces on the floor.

457
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:00,350
Fine.

458
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:09,950
Your hand is injured?

459
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:12,470
It's nothing.

460
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:13,580
Where should I put them?

461
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:19,630
Put them here.

462
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,110
Is there anything else

463
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,200
you need help with?

464
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:33,470
Why are you always

465
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:34,670
so eager to help others?

466
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:38,470
Doing a good deed every day

467
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:40,100
is a requirement I set for myself.

468
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,830
If there's nothing else, you can go now.

469
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:53,020
Let go of my father!

470
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:54,890
Don't touch my father!

471
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:55,550
Miss Yu,

472
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:56,190
Don't touch him!

473
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:57,260
Your father has been dead for a while.

474
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,310
You kept it hidden,

475
00:22:58,670 --> 00:22:59,550
but the other passengers in the cabin

476
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,990
found out.

477
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:02,390
Who wants to share a room

478
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:03,440
with a dead body?

479
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,110
Good thing you're in the sky.

480
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:05,990
If this were on the land,

481
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:07,470
you would've been thrown off the ship already.

482
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,510
We're just

483
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:10,160
moving him to the cargo hold.

484
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,230
Is that not okay?

485
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:13,480
I don't want to make things difficult for you,

486
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:14,950
but the cargo hold

487
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:16,870
is where you keep live chickens and ducks.

488
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,800
It's filthy and chaotic.

489
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:20,910
How can I let my father's body

490
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:22,310
stay there?

491
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:24,790
All the other cargo holds are full.

492
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:26,630
Please try to understand our situation.

493
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:28,200
Why are you wasting time talking to her?

494
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,060
Just move him quickly.

495
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:29,910
Aren't you afraid of bad luck?

496
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,260
Move him to my cabin.

497
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,070
I have a private cabin,

498
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:34,430
and it won't bother anyone.

499
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:38,550
Is that not okay?

500
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:40,390
If you're willing,

501
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:41,820
then there's no problem.

502
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,160
Then bring him in.

503
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:45,750
Take him away.

504
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,270
Mr. Yuan is such a good man.

505
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:56,850
Yesterday, he even read my family letters for me.

506
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,390
Indeed, doing so many good deeds

507
00:23:58,390 --> 00:23:59,750
will surely bring him a long life.

508
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:02,500
Thank you, Mr. Yuan.

509
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:03,870
Thank you, Mr. Yuan.

510
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:04,750
No need to be so polite.

511
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:05,790
Please, rise quickly.

512
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:28,160
So, you

513
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,430
want to cooperate with me?

514
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:31,910
Yes.

515
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:35,270
Our goals don't conflict,

516
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,030
and I can provide you with

517
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:38,830
information about Mr. Yuan.

518
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:44,390
Do you know who I am?

519
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:45,590
I don't care who you are.

520
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:47,260
As long as you don't interfere with our plans,

521
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:49,870
you're not our enemy.

522
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:53,190
Interesting.

523
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,710
They say the human race is timid and cowardly,

524
00:24:58,750 --> 00:24:59,990
but you're different.

525
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:01,670
Fine,

526
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:05,000
then tell me everything

527
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:09,200
about Mr. Yuan.

528
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,300
Boss,

529
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,120
could this guy mess things up?

530
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:24,070
He said that Mr. Yuan

531
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,190
is from the Youhu Clan.

532
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,670
Knowing the other's identity,

533
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:27,670
he still dares to act.

534
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,390
He's got guts.

535
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:30,880
So what should we do?

536
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:32,750
Should we wait a bit longer?

537
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:35,390
Maybe he can really succeed.

538
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:37,830
Let him do his thing,

539
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,350
and we'll do ours.

540
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,110
Whether he succeeds or not,

541
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:42,790
once the fire bomb goes off,

542
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,920
everyone

543
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:46,220
will head to the underworld.

544
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:46,950
Well...

545
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:49,110
There's an immortal from the Youhu Clan on this ship.

546
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:50,310
Could something go wrong?

547
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:52,950
So what if they're from the Youhu Clan?

548
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:54,780
Do you really think they're gods?

549
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:56,740
From this height, if they fall,

550
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:58,510
they'll be lucky

551
00:25:58,510 --> 00:25:59,480
to save their own lives.

552
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:02,710
Success or failure hinges on this moment.

553
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:04,300
When the time comes,

554
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,150
everyone

555
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,460
will remember our names.

556
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:19,270
You're back.

557
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:23,150
Did you do all this?

558
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:24,710
Yes, I did.

559
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:26,060
When I'm in a good mood,

560
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,190
I like to tidy up.

561
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:28,870
Come, have a seat.

562
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,150
That's a great habit.

563
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:33,920
I'm exhausted.

564
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,100
Are you particularly tired today?

565
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:38,580
Well, it's the Sea Lantern Festival.

566
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:39,710
Many guests

567
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:40,660
took the ship

568
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:41,820
for the holiday.

569
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:43,510
So we had to decorate

570
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:44,670
and clean everywhere.

571
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,300
It's inevitable to feel a bit tired.

572
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,650
What's the Sea Lantern Festival?

573
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:53,260
You don't know?

574
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,150
The Sea Lantern Festival?

575
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:04,030
Yes.

576
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:06,610
The Sea Lantern Festival is a holiday

577
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,520
where the human race pray to the gods.

578
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:10,310
Because this place is the highest

579
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:11,910
and closest to the heavens,

580
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:13,180
many people

581
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,460
take this ship specifically

582
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:16,720
to release lanterns.

583
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,810
We believe that as long as we write our blessings

584
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:21,270
on the lanterns

585
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,830
and release them into the sky,

586
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:24,710
the gods will hear

587
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:25,830
our prayers

588
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:28,430
and grant our wishes.

589
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:31,310
We usually commemorate our departed loved ones

590
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,830
on the day.

591
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,900
During the Sea Lantern Festival,

592
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,060
guests release lanterns

593
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,870
filled with their blessings

594
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:39,710
into the wind. They soar through the sky,

595
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:41,470
nearly illuminating the entire night—

596
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:43,370
a rare and breathtaking sight.

597
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,660
I suppose the old man you mentioned

598
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:48,350
came for this reason too.

599
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:49,630
It's just a pity

600
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:51,270
that he'll never see it again.

601
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:52,750
But

602
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:55,310
have you ever thought that

603
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,350
maybe the gods

604
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:57,710
don't actually hear

605
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:58,750
your prayers at all?

606
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,010
It doesn't matter.

607
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:01,760
As long as we believe, that's enough.

608
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:22,070
Take it slow.

609
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:42,070
Go in.

610
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:44,270
Go.

611
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:46,950
Go.

612
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:49,510
Go in.

613
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:54,670
My friend!

614
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:57,550
Who are you?

615
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:01,550
You've been hard to find.

616
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:08,390
Look at that one,

617
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:09,160
so beautiful.

618
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:14,190
It's flying, flying high!

619
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:15,710
May the gods bless me

620
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:17,030
to grow up quickly.

621
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:19,440
It's flying, flying high!

622
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:20,910
Be careful!

623
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:21,910
Don't fall.

624
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:23,230
I know.

625
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:24,030
Go play.

626
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:36,100
Miss,

627
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:37,940
could you tell me how to get to the first-class cabins?

628
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,000
What did you say?

629
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:49,820
I... I was asking

630
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:51,940
how to get to the first-class cabins.

631
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:54,270
It's my first time on the ship,

632
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:55,070
and after walking around a bit,

633
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,550
I can't remember the way back.

634
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,470
First-class cabins...

635
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:00,880
Go upstairs from there,

636
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,470
and you'll reach the first-class cabin.

637
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:05,000
Wait.

638
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:07,670
Is there anything else?

639
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:11,180
I just wanted to say

640
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:13,750
thank you.

641
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:20,590
Who is the host inviting to the banquet

642
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:22,030
at the Dragon Hall tonight?

643
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:23,350
It's quite a grand affair.

644
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,640
You don't know?

645
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,030
It's an immortal from the Youhu Clan.

646
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:26,820
An immortal?

647
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:27,590
Really?

648
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:28,790
Haven't you noticed

649
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:29,870
what kind of person our host is?

650
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:31,240
An ordinary person wouldn't deserve

651
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,910
such careful and attentive treatment.

652
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:33,750
I heard that person

653
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,110
boarded at Hulu Port.

654
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,030
Isn't Hulu Port

655
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:37,400
very close to Fangwai Mountain?

656
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:38,630
And I caught a glimpse of

657
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:39,670
that young master from afar.

658
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:41,390
He had an immortal aura—no mistake about it.

659
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:42,350
Really?

660
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:14,750
What's the matter?

661
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,940
That father and daughter got off the ship

662
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,440
at Xing'an Port at noon today.

663
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,460
Miss Yu couldn't find you,

664
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,830
so she asked me to pass on

665
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:26,110
her gratitude to you.

666
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,070
What's wrong with this lantern?

667
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,570
Let me take a look.

668
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:42,190
This thin string isn't just for decoration.

669
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:43,870
You need to tie it tightly,

670
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:44,870
or

671
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:46,550
the hot air will escape from here.

672
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:47,750
Without enough upward force,

673
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:49,270
the lantern won't fly.

674
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:51,070
Look, it's fixed now.

675
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:14,770
Aren't you going to make a wish?

676
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,350
When you release the lantern,

677
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:18,670
you need to say your wish out loud

678
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,990
so the gods can hear it

679
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,650
and help make it come true.

680
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:25,540
Can they hear it?

681
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:27,950
I don't know about others,

682
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:29,430
but if you make a wish,

683
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:30,950
the gods will surely hear it.

684
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:35,180
Make a wish.

685
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:38,870
There's no need.

686
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:40,480
I don't have any wishes.

687
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:43,110
That can't be.

688
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:44,710
Everyone has wishes.

689
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:46,830
Do you have a wish?

690
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:48,150
Yes, I do.

691
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:49,710
I hope

692
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,030
I can complete

693
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:53,260
my mission

694
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:54,190
smoothly, steadily,

695
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:55,350
and with a clear conscience.

696
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:57,680
I also hope for peace across the Six Realms,

697
00:32:57,990 --> 00:32:59,110
love in the world,

698
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:01,590
and the endless cycle of life for all things.

699
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:04,950
You're just a handmaiden,

700
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,860
yet you think quite a lot.

701
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:54,110
Mr. Tanghua,

702
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,990
the banquet is ready.

703
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:58,200
Let's take our seats.

704
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:08,030
Look,

705
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:09,389
there's a lantern

706
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:10,670
that looks like a fish,

707
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:12,699
and another like a butterfly.

708
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,350
What does that one look like?

709
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:16,219
A steamed bun?

710
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:20,870
Why is your sea lantern

711
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:22,270
so plain?

712
00:34:22,949 --> 00:34:23,870
I just bought anything.

713
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:26,190
Let me make you a new one.

714
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:27,909
I'm quite skilled.

715
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:28,870
Do you have

716
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:29,909
a style you like?

717
00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:37,590
Don't you believe me?

718
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:41,179
I've been learning the craft from my teacher since I was a child.

719
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,670
My teacher is very skilled at

720
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:43,550
making lanterns.

721
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,880
The sea lanterns he makes

722
00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:46,219
will never fall.

723
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:47,350
They keep flying

724
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:49,949
and can even cross the Sea of Flux,

725
00:34:49,949 --> 00:34:51,150
all the way to the Divine Realm.

726
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,620
Have you been to the Divine Realm?

727
00:34:53,889 --> 00:34:55,440
How do you know your teacher's lanterns

728
00:34:55,469 --> 00:34:56,840
can fly through the Sea of Flux

729
00:34:56,909 --> 00:34:58,070
and reach the Divine Realm?

730
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:58,960
Maybe they

731
00:34:58,990 --> 00:34:59,990
just burned up or fell somewhere

732
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,140
out of sight,

733
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:03,530
tumbling into a filthy ditch

734
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:04,950
and shattering to pieces.

735
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:07,350
Anyway, I just know.

736
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:18,150
Take it back quickly!

737
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:19,190
Be gentle!

738
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:19,990
Useless.

739
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:21,750
Its life is more precious than yours.

740
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:22,490
Yes.

741
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:31,460
Let's go.

742
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:39,150
It's gone.

743
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:40,270
You don't have to be afraid anymore.

744
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:41,900
Why should I be afraid?

745
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:47,300
You're a handmaiden on the tower ship?

746
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,210
What's your name?

747
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:50,350
Xue.

748
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:51,540
How long have you been working here?

749
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,720
Over two years.

750
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:54,750
Then you must know the people and happenings

751
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:56,000
on this ship pretty well?

752
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:58,830
I guess so.

753
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:00,540
Okay.

754
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:02,100
Then let me ask you,

755
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:03,510
who is the guest

756
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:05,110
being entertained in the private room on the second floor over there?

757
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,440
You don't know?

758
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:14,500
Aren't you

759
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,910
the handmaiden on the tower ship?

760
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:16,770
Well...

761
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,430
Even a handmaiden doesn't

762
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:20,030
know everything.

763
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:21,470
Look at how many people there are,

764
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,710
and how big this tower ship is.

765
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,990
I'm very busy every day,

766
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:25,720
with so many things to do.

767
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,540
I don't see you being busy.

768
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:30,270
I'm just stealing a moment of leisure.

769
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:32,070
I can't always be busy;

770
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:33,600
I need to balance work and rest.

771
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,060
Why do you keep following me?

772
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:53,110
I'm not following you.

773
00:36:58,070 --> 00:36:58,870
Alright.

774
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:00,770
I heard that you

775
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:02,190
are generous and kind-hearted,

776
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:03,530
and enjoy helping others.

777
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:05,540
So I have a favor to ask.

778
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:07,110
What is it?

779
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:08,910
I want to follow you

780
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,380
and be your personal handmaiden.

781
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:12,950
Actually, here's the thing.

782
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:14,510
My family lives in Yandu City,

783
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:15,590
and it's hard to make a living there.

784
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:16,660
After my elder brother

785
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,230
got married and had children,

786
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:19,430
our house became too small.

787
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,910
So I thought of

788
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:22,360
coming here to the tower ship to find work.

789
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,870
But as you know,

790
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:25,350
the tower ship is full of all kinds of people,

791
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:26,390
and I don't get along well with them.

792
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:28,980
So I wanted to find a kind,

793
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:29,770
gentle,

794
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,480
and easy-to-get-along-with master to serve.

795
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:33,960
Coincidentally, you showed up.

796
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:34,840
I've also heard

797
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,890
that you are kind-hearted

798
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:37,070
and treat laborers and servants

799
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:38,270
all equally.

800
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:39,810
So...

801
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:51,730
Neither disguise

802
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:53,470
nor illusion.

803
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:55,230
Then what is it?

804
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:57,360
What are you doing?

805
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,260
You said your name is Xue, right?

806
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:03,610
Yes.

807
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:04,740
Do you also know craftsmanship?

808
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:06,590
No, I don't.

809
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:08,230
Then why do you know how to fix sea lanterns?

810
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:10,070
Sea lanterns?

811
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:11,860
Aren't they just lanterns?

812
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,390
It's very simple.

813
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:14,780
It has nothing to do with craftsmanship.

814
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:16,310
Do you know Ji Tanyin?

815
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:17,030
Who?

816
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,150
Whatever your purpose is,

817
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:26,300
stay away from me.

818
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:28,750
I'm not a kind-hearted person,

819
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:30,050
and I don't need a handmaiden.

820
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,040
Don't follow me.

821
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,340
He's quite alert.

822
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:45,550
Watch out!

823
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:52,660
Mr. Tanghua,

824
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:53,810
please.

825
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,680
I tried to visit the mountain

826
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:07,110
several times recently

827
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:08,850
but never had the chance to meet you.

828
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,950
Who would have thought that leaving

829
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:12,910
would finally make it happen?

830
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:16,310
This is truly my luck.

831
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:18,330
There are many affairs in the mountains

832
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:19,750
that require my personal attention,

833
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:21,400
so I couldn't fulfill my duties as a host.

834
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:22,840
Please don't blame me, Mr. Shen.

835
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:26,190
Mr. Tanghua, you're too polite.

836
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:28,310
As a leading figure among the immortal race,

837
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,200
responsible for the safety of the world,

838
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:31,710
you're bound to be busy.

839
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:33,990
But no matter how busy you are,

840
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,280
you must find time to rest.

841
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,990
Now that the world is at peace

842
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:41,030
and the people live and work in contentment,

843
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:43,430
it's all the merit of the Youhu Clan

844
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:45,370
and you.

845
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:47,350
I know

846
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:50,180
that immortals are compassionate

847
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,350
and care deeply for the people.

848
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,660
But to truly transcend the world,

849
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:56,550
one must first engage with it.

850
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:58,170
Isn't it a waste

851
00:39:58,510 --> 00:39:59,960
of this beautiful world

852
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,190
to focus solely on arduous cultivation?

853
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:04,030
Sir, look,

854
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:05,950
the full moon hangs in the sky.

855
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,070
We soar through the clouds,

856
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,870
raising our toasts to the moon

857
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:11,590
and enjoying wine and conversation.

858
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,030
Isn't this kind of ease

859
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,620
also a great life?

860
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:18,630
Mr. Shen, you have a silver tongue.

861
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:20,100
You are right.

862
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:22,670
Peace across the land and the people living in contentment

863
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:24,430
is indeed a great life.

864
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:30,430
It's just a pity that

865
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:31,750
such good days

866
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:33,180
may not last long.

867
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:36,040
Everyone knows that

868
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:37,070
the Youhu Clan

869
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:38,950
is descended from the spirit foxes of Fangwai Mountain.

870
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:40,910
But the War Demon is different.

871
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:42,620
They come from the Divine Realm,

872
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:43,780
and have always taken pride in this

873
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:45,510
for thousands of years.

874
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:48,410
But Mr. Shen, do you know

875
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:50,660
why these descendants of the divine race

876
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:52,310
came to the mortal world?

877
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:55,030
Well...

878
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:57,420
I don't know.

879
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:00,430
Legend has it that the War Demon

880
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:02,100
once committed an unforgivable crime

881
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:03,910
and were exiled to the mortal world as a whole clan.

882
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:06,350
But after all, they are of divine race descent—

883
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:08,430
invulnerable to blades and fire.

884
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:10,630
Thus, the War Demons are incredibly powerful in battle,

885
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:13,100
often able to fight one against a hundred.

886
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:14,750
During the Battle of Pinghu back then,

887
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:17,310
our clan suffered heavy losses because of this.

888
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,400
Fortunately, the High Priest was talented,

889
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:23,030
turned the tide and annihilated the War Demon

890
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:24,770
with the power of Divine Hand.

891
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:27,230
But the War Demons were not completely wiped out.

892
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:28,830
A few days ago,

893
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:29,870
sorcery descended

894
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:31,450
upon Fangwai Mountain,

895
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,910
and I saw it with my own eyes.

896
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:35,190
Mr. Shen, you've sent so many

897
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:36,590
handmaidens from the human race up the mountain.

898
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:37,910
Haven't you heard even

899
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:38,990
a whisper about it?

900
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,220
Sir,

901
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:44,270
you must be mistaken.

902
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:47,310
Our clan sent handmaidens up the mountain

903
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:48,910
to express our admiration,

904
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:51,030
and gratitude for the Youhu Clan's kindness.

905
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:53,470
The handmaidens who went up the mountain

906
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:55,790
have no connection to us.

907
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:57,660
Mr. Shen, no need to be nervous.

908
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:59,550
I came here to meet you

909
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:01,310
to ask for an important favor.

910
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:02,830
Since the Battle of Pinghu,

911
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:05,310
our clan has been tracking the remnants of the War Demons,

912
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:06,350
but they've seemed

913
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:07,710
vanished without a trace,

914
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,910
leaving us searching in vain.

915
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:12,510
Now that they dare to return,

916
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:14,870
they must have some backing.

917
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:18,990
Our two clans have always been closely connected.

918
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:21,670
I hope we can join hands once again

919
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:22,990
and face this together.

920
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:24,310
The War Demons

921
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:26,270
are our common enemy.

922
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:29,920
But this matter is too significant

923
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:31,830
for a mere envoy like me

924
00:42:31,830 --> 00:42:33,390
to decide.

925
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:35,180
Rest assured, Sir.

926
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,650
I will report this

927
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,880
to the City Lord as soon as possible.

928
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:41,430
Later,

929
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,680
I will personally go to Yandu

930
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,480
to meet with the City Lord

931
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:47,350
and discuss this matter with him.
