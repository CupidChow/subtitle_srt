1
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,030
Five hundred years ago,

2
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,810
the war between gods and demons shattered the celestial ladder.

3
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:17,910
The left hand of Deity Taihe,

4
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,670
which concentrated the power of all gods,

5
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:21,270
fell into the mortal world.

6
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:24,150
Having lost his primordial divine power,

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,930
he was lost in the void, unable to awaken.

8
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:29,180
The Divine Realm weakened as a result.

9
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:31,990
Gods fell one after another,

10
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,550
and the mortal world was cut off from the Divine Realm.

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,060
Only the human race

12
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,490
and two immortal clans, the Youhu Clan and the War Demons,

13
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,880
stayed in the mortal world.

14
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,770
[A Moment But Forever]

15
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,670
[Episode 1]

16
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:23,220
My name is Ji Tanyin.

17
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,870
People also call me Goddess Wushuang.

18
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,150
A thousand years ago, I ascended to the Divine Realm

19
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,300
through my craftsmanship.

20
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,100
As the creator of the divine hand,

21
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,310
I went to the mortal world to search for it.

22
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,230
However, with the celestial ladder shattered

23
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,780
and the passage between realms destroyed,

24
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,900
I was severely injured as I passed through

25
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,030
the Sea of Flux.

26
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,950
After a near-death experience,

27
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,400
I was trapped on Wu Mountain.

28
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:46,050
After I woke up,

29
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,630
I learned that the Youhu Clan

30
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,829
had produced a prodigious young man.

31
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:50,650
I suspected

32
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,579
that the Divine Hand might be in his possession.

33
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,329
So I rushed to the Pinghu battlefield.

34
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:12,870
That young man was indeed

35
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,350
the new host of the Divine Hand.

36
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,630
However, he couldn't

37
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,380
fully control the power of the Divine Hand yet.

38
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,190
Stop!

39
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,100
With a single strike,

40
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,590
he nearly shattered the entire Pinghu.

41
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:31,670
To save lives,

42
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:32,940
I intercepted half of his attack,

43
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:34,480
sustaining severe injuries myself.

44
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,790
Along with half of Pinghu,

45
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:37,150
I sank into the sea.

46
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:40,950
Tanyin.

47
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:42,850
Tanyin.

48
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:44,750
You must go to Fangwai Mountain

49
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,190
to retrieve the Divine Left Hand.

50
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,950
The High Priest of Youhu Clan

51
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,270
is a brutal and violent person.

52
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,950
He's unworthy of being the Divine Hand's host.

53
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,490
We can't wait any longer.

54
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,100
Now,

55
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:06,110
[Youhu Clan] [Fangwai Mountain]

56
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:05,360
the human race became dependent on the Youhu Clan.

57
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:06,730
Every year, they offer tribute,

58
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,410
providing treasures and young girls

59
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,650
to enter Fangwai Immortal Mountain

60
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:10,970
as slaves and servants.

61
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:12,580
And this

62
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,180
is also the best opportunity for me to enter the mountain.

63
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,450
Shen Ying, the envoy from the human race,

64
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,620
[Foreign Affairs Scribe of the human race, Shen Ying]

65
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:39,420
respectfully welcomes the Youhu Clan's immortal elder.

66
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,300
It's the ninth day of the third month again.

67
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,260
[Steward of the Youhu Clan, Sheng Xiang]

68
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:42,770
The human race is here as usual

69
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:45,020
to pay homage to the Youhu Clan immortals

70
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,460
and present tributes.

71
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:48,980
We present excellent young maidens from our clan

72
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,010
to serve as maids in the immortal mountain.

73
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,010
This mountain is called Fangwai,

74
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:54,820
it has spirits because immortals reside here.

75
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:56,090
It must not be desecrated.

76
00:04:57,659 --> 00:05:00,300
Shen Ying pays respects to the spirit of Fangwai Mountain.

77
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,230
Why aren't you bowing?

78
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:11,990
The mountain spirit doesn't need my worship.

79
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,330
[Craftswoman of the Divine Race, Ji Tanyin]

80
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:20,050
You can communicate with the mountain?

81
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,290
Fangwai has a spirit

82
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,300
that can understand the intentions of all living beings.

83
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,420
What's your name?

84
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:27,890
Ji Tanyin.

85
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,850
The mountain path is foggy.

86
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:40,450
Use my lamp

87
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,780
to light your way.

88
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:43,290
Thank you.

89
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,690
This is a divine lantern. It will extinguish if it touches the ground.

90
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:49,570
If the lamp goes out,

91
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:51,260
you won't be able to enter the mountain.

92
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:20,750
[High Priest, Yuanzhong]

93
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,890
Earth is the mother of air.

94
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:24,010
Where there is earth, there is air.

95
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,700
Air is the mother of water.

96
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,460
Where there is air, there is water.

97
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:30,220
Therefore, what should be kept dry should be buried deep.

98
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,810
While what is stored on flat and open ground should be buried shallow.

99
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:36,180
The classics state that when earth flows, air flows,

100
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,930
and thus things come to life.

101
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,400
[Human Alchemist]

102
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:56,940
Esteemed sir. you're sitting at the burial place

103
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,260
I've chosen for my client.

104
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:01,730
Could I trouble you to move a bit?

105
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:05,770
Do you know where this is?

106
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:07,130
Where?

107
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:08,650
This is Fangwai Mountain.

108
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:10,940
This... this...

109
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,610
You dare to choose a burial place on Fangwai Mountain?

110
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:17,740
How bold of you.

111
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,980
This... this... I...

112
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:20,740
I was clearly supposed to

113
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,620
go to Qiguan Mountain!

114
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,410
There was a storm, and then...

115
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:27,170
How did I end up on Fangwai Mountain?

116
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:29,860
Thank you for informing me, esteemed sir.

117
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:30,890
May I ask if you are

118
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:33,280
an immortal from this mountain?

119
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:34,850
I suppose so.

120
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,360
No wonder, no wonder.

121
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,290
I see you have a noble countenance,

122
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:41,500
destined for great wealth and honor.

123
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,380
You will surely enjoy good health throughout your life,

124
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,380
everything will go smoothly,

125
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,500
your descendants will bring you joy,

126
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,659
and you'll experience the greatest pleasures of the mortal world!

127
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:52,250
Me?

128
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,290
Yes, indeed.

129
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,640
Good health?

130
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:56,090
Everything goes smoothly?

131
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:57,780
Yes, look.

132
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,170
Li represents Fire and Zhen represents Mountain Lake.

133
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:00,810
Fire above Heaven represents Great Possession, and Wind and Thunder represent Great Strength.

134
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:02,180
It's a sign of rising.

135
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,620
Good fortune, good fortune indeed!

136
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,150
You will soon meet

137
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,020
your destined benefactor.

138
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:09,170
She comes from an extraordinary background

139
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:10,220
and is immensely wealthy and noble.

140
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,220
As long as you meet her,

141
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,810
your life will be smooth sailing from then on.

142
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:14,570
No more misfortunes will befall you.

143
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,580
Good health.

144
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:19,850
Yes.

145
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:21,280
Everything goes smoothly.

146
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:22,250
Indeed.

147
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,810
I'm usually wrong nine times out of ten,

148
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:28,650
but this is my last divination for today.

149
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,970
Trust me, it will surely be accurate.

150
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,320
Trust me, it will surely be accurate!

151
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,169
Is the lantern heavy?

152
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:45,690
Do you need help with it?

153
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,690
No need.

154
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,220
This is a divine lantern. It will extinguish if it touches the ground.

155
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,240
If the light goes out,

156
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:58,780
you won't be able to enter the mountain.

157
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:03,010
It has a sinking stone on it.

158
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,450
All these paths lead up the mountain anyway.

159
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:36,210
Just pick any one.

160
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:37,970
Why hesitate here?

161
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:00,530
Are you an immortal residing on this mountain?

162
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:01,650
Yes.

163
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:03,580
Then why don't you

164
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,460
just point out a path for me?

165
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,900
Why make me choose for myself?

166
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:07,370
I don't know your identity,

167
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:09,660
nor do I know where you're heading.

168
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:11,380
How can I guide you?

169
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:13,090
I'm a human sent here

170
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:14,140
as a maid candidate.

171
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,220
I'm from Pingzhou,

172
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,720
heading to the gate of Fangwai Mountain.

173
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,980
A maid candidate?

174
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,820
What's your name?

175
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,220
Since I don't know your identity,

176
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,540
how can I know

177
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,620
if what you're saying is true or false?

178
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,420
How can I easily let you up the mountain?

179
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:36,530
That path is wrong.

180
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,690
This one might not be right either.

181
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:44,540
You're a human craftsman.

182
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:45,700
What's it to you?

183
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:46,890
Just curious.

184
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,580
A craftsman's status is noble.

185
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,720
How could you willingly

186
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,540
come to Fangwai Mountain to be a maid?

187
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,490
I've long admired

188
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:54,740
the Youhu Clan's High Priest

189
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,970
and am willing to serve him for life.

190
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:56,820
Is that not allowed?

191
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,170
What are you laughing at?

192
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:03,690
Nothing.

193
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:08,740
Come.

194
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,290
I'll take you up the mountain.

195
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,250
The fog is thick in the mountains.

196
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:28,620
Watch your step.

197
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,050
Alright.

198
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,370
We're almost there.

199
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:42,820
Thanks.

200
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:44,850
You still haven't told me your name.

201
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:46,490
You haven't told me your name either.

202
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:47,690
But I helped you.

203
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,690
That's not a grateful attitude.

204
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,550
What's this?

205
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,090
It's a lucky egg. I made it.

206
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:58,410
It can bring you good luck.

207
00:11:58,810 --> 00:11:59,900
How magical.

208
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,180
You're going to serve the High Priest?

209
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:06,180
He's not exactly

210
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,140
an easy person to get along with.

211
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:24,370
Peace, joy, and prosperity to you.

212
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:33,690
It's time.

213
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:35,100
Everyone, please enter.

214
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,030
Immortal Elder, please wait.

215
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:40,180
Could you make an exception?

216
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:42,170
There's still one person who hasn't...

217
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,010
She's here!

218
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:49,460
I'm returning this to you.

219
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:50,940
Thank you, Immortal Elder, for bestowing the lantern.

220
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:56,420
Not bad.

221
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:57,570
Let's go.

222
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,700
[Youhu]

223
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,280
There are many barrier formations within our clan.

224
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:11,100
Some of which are used for powerful attacks and defeating enemies.

225
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,420
Without guidance, do not wander aimlessly.

226
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:14,850
Lest you lose your life.

227
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:18,220
Thank you for your advice, Immortal Elder.

228
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,930
The Fangwai Immortal Mountain

229
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,130
has a total of nine towering peaks

230
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:25,770
and three hundred other famous mountains.

231
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,410
Most residents are elders of our clan.

232
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:30,690
That is Tianqu Peak,

233
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,130
the residence of our clan's Elder Dingxu.

234
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,890
Elder Dingxu is our clan leader.

235
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,940
Though he is compassionate and kind,

236
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,780
Tianqu Peak is still a forbidden area.

237
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:43,280
I will keep all this in mind.

238
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:45,180
That Jinxia Palace

239
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:47,180
is the residence of Young Master Tanghua.

240
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:48,730
Young Master Tanghua

241
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:50,460
is the commander of our clan's war department.

242
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:52,100
He often interacts with various clans.

243
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:53,490
Past here,

244
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,740
ahead is Xiaoxiang Peak.

245
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,330
You need to enter Xiaoxiang Peak first

246
00:13:58,330 --> 00:13:59,450
to study your lessons.

247
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,900
After your study period is over,

248
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,330
the masters from each mountain will come to select attendants.

249
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:05,300
Immortal Elder, if I may,

250
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:07,660
what about that peak so high you can't

251
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,270
[Human, Lyu Yao]

252
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,060
even see it?

253
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,890
That's the Yuquan Peak,

254
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,380
the residence of the High Priest.

255
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:23,090
[Yuquan Peak, Liujiao Palace]

256
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,690
[Youhu Clan, Xiaoxiang Peak]

257
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:46,610
Greetings, Steward Sheng Xiang.

258
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,800
[Human, instructor of Fangwai Mountain, Zhi Dai]

259
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,540
I'll leave them in your care now.

260
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,100
Rest assured,

261
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,380
I will teach them well.

262
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:03,050
I am Zhi Dai, an instructor at Xiaoxiang Peak.

263
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,180
I'm responsible for your upcoming lessons.

264
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:06,940
I oversee all matters

265
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:09,460
and determine whether you stay or leave.

266
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,170
Steward Shen Ying, who brought us here,

267
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,480
just left like that?

268
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,890
Did I permit you to speak?

269
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:18,420
I know

270
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:20,970
most of you come from noble backgrounds

271
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,260
and have extraordinary origins.

272
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,100
But all of that

273
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,860
is of no use here.

274
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,210
You're here to be servants,

275
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:30,160
to serve others as subordinates.

276
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:31,940
Remember this.

277
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,860
Know your place.

278
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:36,340
As for the rules,

279
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:38,370
I will teach you one by one in the future.

280
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:40,300
Now, five people to a room.

281
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,450
Choose for yourselves.

282
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:44,170
This bell is the signal.

283
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:45,660
When the bell rings, assemble.

284
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:49,220
Peace, joy, and prosperity to you.

285
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,820
Peace, joy, and prosperity to you.

286
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:54,570
Peace, joy, and prosperity to you.

287
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:59,490
Have you taken care of everything I asked?

288
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,050
[Weapon spirit, Zi Fei]

289
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:03,650
You can rest assured when I'm in charge.

290
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:05,570
Take your medicine.

291
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,240
I won't.

292
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:12,220
Fine, don't take it. The sooner you die, the sooner you'll be free.

293
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,060
Then I can find a new master.

294
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:16,820
You won't drink it?

295
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:17,900
Fine, I'll pour it out.

296
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,260
You are my weapon spirit.

297
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,170
If I die, you won't survive either.

298
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,830
Find a new master?

299
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,240
Keep dreaming.

300
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:32,570
Where did you get this?

301
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:35,370
Someone gave it to me.

302
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:36,420
Who?

303
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:38,260
There's someone on this mountain giving you gifts?

304
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,060
I don't know.

305
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,370
I only know it was a human woman,

306
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,430
from Pingzhou.

307
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,250
You went down the mountain without permission today.

308
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,170
Dingxu would be furious if he knew.

309
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,020
What else is there on this mountain

310
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,610
that he doesn't know about?

311
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,010
Go and find me

312
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:00,770
this batch of human maids' roster.

313
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,290
What do you want that for?

314
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:04,930
I'm bored. Just passing time

315
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,810
and doing what a useless person should do.

316
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:35,890
Madam Zhi Dai

317
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,700
seems difficult to get along with.

318
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,780
Well, that's what instructors are like.

319
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,730
We came here

320
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:42,370
just to take orders.

321
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,010
Have you thought about

322
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:45,770
which immortal elder you want to serve?

323
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,890
I heard that Young Master Tanghua

324
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:49,050
is proficient in immortal arts

325
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,900
and is also very kind to humans.

326
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,780
The immortal elders on each peak have different personalities,

327
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,740
different preferences,

328
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,760
and their cultivation styles

329
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,890
are also different.

330
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,650
As long as we cater to their preferences,

331
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:58,530
our chances of staying

332
00:17:58,530 --> 00:17:59,530
are still very high.

333
00:17:59,530 --> 00:17:59,850
are still very high.

334
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:03,340
Lyu Yao, what about you?

335
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:06,100
I haven't decided yet.

336
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:10,000
Do you know anything about

337
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,500
the High Priest of Youhu Clan?

338
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,610
You want to serve the High Priest?

339
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,730
Yuquan Peak is the hardest to get into.

340
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:16,690
I heard it's been many years

341
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:18,100
since they've chosen any maids to enter the palace.

342
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,100
Why is that?

343
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:21,770
Well,

344
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:23,580
do you know what he likes?

345
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:25,340
They say the High Priest of Youhu Clan

346
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,300
is the last god in this world.

347
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,180
The thoughts of a god,

348
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,690
how can mortals possibly understand?

349
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:31,010
If I had to guess,

350
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:33,460
I'd say the High Priest

351
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,380
probably likes killing people.

352
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,100
Killing people?

353
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:37,980
In the Battle of Pinghu,

354
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,010
blood flowed like the sea, and corpses piled up like mountains.

355
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:41,740
It wasn't just the War Demons who died.

356
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,260
Madam Zhi Dai said to follow the bell's command.

357
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,580
Let's hurry over there.

358
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,970
These are for you.

359
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,660
One for each of you.

360
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,810
Wear it on your left wrist.

361
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,370
Why aren't you wearing it?

362
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,620
This seems to be a magical device.

363
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:17,050
I'm asking you.

364
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:18,730
Why aren't you wearing it?

365
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,480
This is a device that restrains people.

366
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,400
Ji Tanyin.

367
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,890
She seems to be a craftsman.

368
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:33,250
They say human craftsmen are highly skilled.

369
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:35,980
Do you think she can

370
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,300
take this off?

371
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:39,860
Why aren't the people from Tianqu Peak

372
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,210
here yet?

373
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:43,700
Sheng Xiang, the steward of Tianqu Peak,

374
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,370
pays respects to the High Priest.

375
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:52,180
What did you say?

376
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:53,700
Look at this bracelet.

377
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,220
It's made of immortal gold,

378
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,410
naturally formless

379
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:57,540
and not limited in shape.

380
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:58,900
It can be big or small.

381
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,060
It can open and close at will.

382
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,770
It has yin-yang fish patterns on it,

383
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:05,500
paired with a Taiji diagram.

384
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,970
It has features

385
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,290
both visible and hidden.

386
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:10,690
This is clearly a

387
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:12,010
device for restraining people.

388
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:14,760
Although the craftsmanship is a bit rough,

389
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,170
and the technique is not sophisticated,

390
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,600
it's similar in principle to Xuantan Zhenjun's dragon-binding rope

391
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,340
and the Immortal Granny's jade fire tongs.

392
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:22,100
They share the same effect through different means.

393
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,620
This Two-Form Immobilizing Bracelet

394
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:26,180
is a divine treasure.

395
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,780
Every human entering the mountain receives one.

396
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,660
It's used to restrict their movements

397
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,170
and confine their whereabouts.

398
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,330
Confine our whereabouts?

399
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,180
You don't need to feel dissatisfied

400
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,970
or think that wearing this

401
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:41,380
forfeits your freedom and traps you

402
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,410
like a bird in a cage.

403
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:45,180
Fangwai Mountain is the dwelling place of immortals.

404
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,420
There are many forbidden areas in the mountain

405
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,130
that cannot be entered.

406
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,260
And the immortal elders in the mountain

407
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,410
have capricious personalities.

408
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,850
They don't have time to watch over you all day.

409
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,500
With this Two-Form Immobilizing Bracelet,

410
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,420
you'll know

411
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,370
where you can and cannot go.

412
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:02,260
You can avoid making mistakes

413
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,170
and harming yourselves.

414
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,640
So if we accidentally take the wrong path

415
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:07,860
and enter a forbidden area,

416
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:09,100
how will this bracelet

417
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:10,610
remind us?

418
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,040
Try it and you'll find out.

419
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:17,130
Fangwai Mountain never lacks people.

420
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,710
If you don't want to stay here,

421
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:19,810
leave early.

422
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:24,020
High Priest.

423
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:25,820
Speak your mind.

424
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:28,580
I mainly want to report to you about

425
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:31,420
the human maids coming up the mountain for selection.

426
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,260
That's your business.

427
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:35,290
Thank you for your trust, High Priest.

428
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:36,380
Is there anything else?

429
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,610
Then that's all.

430
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:39,250
You may leave then.

431
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,140
Yes.

432
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,350
Oh, look at my memory.

433
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,170
I almost forgot one thing.

434
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:53,420
Just now, Elder Dingxu

435
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,570
asked me to inquire

436
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,940
if you went down the mountain today.

437
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,090
And what for?

438
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,250
To fish.

439
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,460
To fish?

440
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:03,740
That's right.

441
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:04,930
They're kept in the back kitchen.

442
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,010
Do you want to go see?

443
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:06,810
No need.

444
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:09,450
You must be in a good mood.

445
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,820
I've finished my studies for today.

446
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:12,970
I was bored

447
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,140
and decided to stroll about.

448
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:16,150
Is there a problem?

449
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,400
Of course not.

450
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,530
High Priest, you are a demigod.

451
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:20,650
You're highly noble.

452
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:21,700
All things in the world

453
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,580
exist to serve you.

454
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:25,020
Naturally, you can go

455
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,050
wherever you wish.

456
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:28,620
It's just that Elder Dingxu said

457
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,450
your health is poor

458
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:31,970
and you're carrying a divine artifact.

459
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,700
You shouldn't wander too far.

460
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:35,580
Also,

461
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:37,460
Elder Dingxu also said,

462
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,540
to better assist you

463
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,660
guard the void, gather energy,

464
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,890
and communicate with heaven and earth,

465
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,140
the previously once-in-ten-days

466
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,410
spirit refinement at Tianqu Peak

467
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,380
has been changed to once every five days.

468
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,170
Please remember

469
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,450
and do not delay.

470
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:52,190
I will now take my leave.

471
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,370
They're so obedient,

472
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:00,010
exactly as you thought.

473
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:36,050
He has perfectly merged with the Divine Hand.

474
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:38,300
Given his mortal constitution,

475
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:40,700
taking the hand means killing him.

476
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,940
But I can't be soft-hearted.

477
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,120
Hannyu said

478
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,620
he's a brutal and violent man.

479
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,420
With the Divine Hand in his possession,

480
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,860
it will only bring

481
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,380
greater disaster to the world.

482
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,690
Peace, joy, and prosperity to all.

483
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,130
Peace, joy...

484
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:11,180
Three or five gathered, the sun and moon together.

485
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,260
Emerging from brightness, entering into darkness.

486
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:15,470
Evil spirits dare not face the righteous qi.

487
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,380
Three souls bind to grass, six spirits enter the body.

488
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,930
Evil gods shall be vanquished, destroyed!

489
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:31,650
[Lecture Hall]

490
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:34,980
If you wish to remain by the immortal elders' side,

491
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:36,610
you must follow their orders,

492
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,650
perform their tasks, and record their affairs.

493
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:41,580
To attend to the immortal elders' daily needs,

494
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,660
being able to write well

495
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:45,690
is particularly important.

496
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:47,150
Let's begin.

497
00:24:58,090 --> 00:24:59,620
It's said that the High Priest of Youhu Clan

498
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:01,820
changes his words daily and his moods unpredictably.

499
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,410
If someone violates

500
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:04,460
his taboos,

501
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:06,050
he kills without hesitation.

502
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,690
When you enter the hall later,

503
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,280
you must all remain silent.

504
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,090
Yes.

505
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:13,380
Steward Sheng Xiang said

506
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,260
the High Priest drinks

507
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:14,930
one hundred jars of wine every night.

508
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,340
This wine is for the High Priest.

509
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,930
If we don't deliver it soon, our lives may be at stake.

510
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,010
Hurry, hurry!

511
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:20,970
May the gods bless me

512
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,530
to be selected by the Jinxia Palace.

513
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,050
I really don't want to die.

514
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:26,020
The High Priest of Liujiao Palace is brutal and violent.

515
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,100
He likes to eat human necks

516
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,810
and favors young, beautiful women.

517
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:30,450
I really, really don't want to die.

518
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:34,450
With just one palm strike from the High Priest,

519
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:37,930
the entire Pinghu Xianzhou instantly collapsed.

520
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:42,030
The birds and beasts in the vicinity

521
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,570
all turned to dust.

522
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:46,260
Not a single member of the War Demon clan survived.

523
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,140
The chieftain of the War Demon clan

524
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:50,420
clung to his last breath, refusing to die.

525
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,450
High Priest stepped forward,

526
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:55,010
grabbed the opponent's head,

527
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:58,490
and bit down with his mouth.

528
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:04,250
I told you to practice calligraphy.

529
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,450
What are you doing?

530
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,100
Tanyin.

531
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:16,690
Tanyin.

532
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:18,300
Mr. Loong.

533
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,120
Tanyin.

534
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:23,510
Have you seen the young lad from the

535
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:25,230
[Master Yi of the Divine Race, Mr. Loong]

536
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:25,100
Youhu Clan with the Divine Hand?

537
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,130
I have.

538
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:27,060
How was it?

539
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:28,890
Just as Hannv said,

540
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:30,250
he's a brutal person.

541
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:31,700
He's killed countless people outside

542
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,080
and enslaved his own clan internally.

543
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,460
He deserves to die.

544
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,790
Then I'm relieved.

545
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:39,620
I was worried you might become softhearted.

546
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,050
Don't worry, Mr. Loong.

547
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:42,120
That won't happen.

548
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:45,570
So when do you plan to make your move?

549
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,410
Tomorrow is the 19th of March.

550
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:50,410
The mysterious gives birth to all things,

551
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:51,440
nine times nine returns to one.

552
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:52,850
The Way of Heaven is governed by nine.

553
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:54,320
I like this number.

554
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:56,720
The opponent is the host of the Divine Hand.

555
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,530
I'm afraid he won't be easy to deal with.

556
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:00,010
In the mortal realm, do not

557
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:01,880
overuse your magical powers.

558
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,080
At best, it will damage your source of magic,

559
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:05,490
causing your qi and blood to churn.

560
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:07,450
At worst, it will severely injure your spirit,

561
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:08,770
destroying all your cultivation.

562
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:10,360
You must remember this well.

563
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:12,090
Don't worry.

564
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,410
I have craftsmanship skills to rely on,

565
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:14,760
and I know some martial arts techniques.

566
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:16,490
I don't need to rely on divine power for everything.

567
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,200
Besides, I created the Divine Hand.

568
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,450
I know what to do.

569
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,410
Oh, right.

570
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,440
You mentioned earlier that you wanted to go to Fangwai Mountain

571
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,530
to find a young man.

572
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:27,320
He's one of your followers.

573
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,440
Did you find him?

574
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,320
When he saved me back then,

575
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:15,080
he was still a spirit fox.

576
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,800
That half of the jade token was also taken by him.

577
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,170
Now,

578
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:23,870
I don't know where he is.

579
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:30,650
Time has passed,

580
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:32,010
and he has already grown up.

581
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,680
His appearance has also changed.

582
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,760
It shouldn't be that easy to find him.

583
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,810
You are the God of Craftsmanship,

584
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:38,760
with countless followers.

585
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,960
Why do you insist on finding

586
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,960
this particular one?

587
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:42,720
He's different.

588
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,360
But please rest assured, Mr. Loong,

589
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:47,700
I won't neglect my duties for personal reasons.

590
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,450
Madam Zhi Dai.

591
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,000
You've been away from home for 40 years.

592
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,810
Don't you miss

593
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:01,080
your family?

594
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:02,960
Your father is nearly 90 years old.

595
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,480
Living to 70 has been rare since ancient times.

596
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:07,150
Think about it, how much time does he have left?

597
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:11,400
Young Mistress Dai,

598
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,080
may I have a word with you in private?

599
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:16,890
My father,

600
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,180
how is he?

601
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,680
The City Lord has grown old.

602
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,280
These past two years, he's been very ill.

603
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:24,640
When I left,

604
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,450
he was already bedridden.

605
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:29,690
That's why I took the liberty

606
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:31,190
to come see you without permission.

607
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,810
But seeing you today,

608
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,890
you're no different from those

609
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:40,730
maids of our clan who are dogmatically controlled

610
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,550
by the Youhu Clan.

611
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,110
What are you trying to say?

612
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:49,670
Pardon me.

613
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:51,230
I humbly request you to descend the mountain

614
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:52,370
and return to Yandu,

615
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:54,370
to offer your method of reversing aging

616
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,920
and maintaining eternal youth

617
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:57,320
to the old City Lord.

618
00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:00,130
This way, we can safeguard our human race's future.

619
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:10,710
Tanyin, here you are.

620
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:12,570
Have you eaten?

621
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:13,330
Are you hungry?

622
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:14,920
We brought some snacks back.

623
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,920
Try one quickly.

624
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:17,610
You're so kind.

625
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:18,960
She has gotten on

626
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,280
Madam Zhi Dai's good side.

627
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,160
Instead of practicing,

628
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,280
she can hide here and slack off.

629
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,160
How could she be hungry?

630
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,480
Quick, have a taste.

631
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:30,370
Is it good?

632
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,810
I made these.

633
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,890
We were in the kitchen this afternoon,

634
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:34,950
practicing our culinary skills.

635
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,850
The ingredients in the kitchen are all excellent.

636
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:37,800
So the taste of what we make

637
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,970
naturally can't be bad.

638
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,200
Have some more.

639
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:41,310
Thank you.

640
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:44,490
Do you know?

641
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:46,600
Today is the White Robe Festival of the Youhu Clan.

642
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:47,850
White Robe Festival?

643
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:48,970
What kind of festival is that?

644
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,830
It's when the Youhu Clan pays tribute to ghosts and gods

645
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:53,360
and worships their ancestors.

646
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,960
The Youhu Clan are already divine beings themselves.

647
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,130
Do they still need to worship ghosts and gods?

648
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:58,410
How can they be considered divine beings?

649
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,360
The Youhu Clan is just like us humans.

650
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:01,800
We're all mortal beings.

651
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:04,690
Tell me,

652
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,250
are there really ghosts and monsters in this world?

653
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:08,160
Of course there are.

654
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,280
I've even seen one.

655
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,600
I was still young at that time.

656
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,480
I remember one year,

657
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,360
during the Zhongyuan Festival,

658
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,640
my parents took me out.

659
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,970
We accidentally got separated.

660
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:16,880
I was crying and searching.

661
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,690
Somehow I ended up by the lake.

662
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:20,280
I squatted by the lake and called out,

663
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,850
"Father, Mother!"

664
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:24,000
Suddenly I heard my mother respond.

665
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:25,880
I looked towards the sound.

666
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,370
There was a big mass of hair in the lake

667
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:30,400
and a pale white face.

668
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:31,840
That face looked like

669
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,530
it had been sewn with a sewing needle.

670
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:35,440
It was full of cracks.

671
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:36,850
And just like that,

672
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,490
it was waving at me

673
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:40,050
and calling my name.

674
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,690
Then what?

675
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:43,530
Then I ran away, of course!

676
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:44,160
Later, I heard

677
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,330
from an elderly neighbor

678
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:47,000
that I had encountered a tailor ghost.

679
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:48,080
A tailor ghost?

680
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:50,170
It's a type of water ghost.

681
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:51,490
They accidentally

682
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:52,450
drowned in the water

683
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,010
and their bodies were eaten by fish and shrimp.

684
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:55,280
With no remains,

685
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,770
they cannot reincarnate.

686
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,290
To find release,

687
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,680
they lure passersby into the water

688
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:00,760
to take

689
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,320
organs similar to their own

690
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,160
and sew a new body.

691
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:11,450
Stop talking about this.

692
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:13,440
You're scaring Tanyin.

693
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,280
I'm not afraid.

694
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:18,160
Madam Zhi Dai is asking someone

695
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,040
to bring tea and snacks to Steward Sheng Xiang.

696
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,170
Who wants to go?

697
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:25,640
No one? Fine.

698
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,840
Then I'll go myself.

699
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,210
That tailor ghost...

700
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:29,970
Wait a moment.

701
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:32,090
I'll go.

702
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,530
Today is the White Robe Festival of the Youhu Clan.

703
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,560
It's similar to our human's

704
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,570
Ghost Festival.

705
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:38,330
But I saw a large mass of hair in the water.

706
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:40,040
There was a pale face within the hair,

707
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,160
covered in cracks,

708
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:41,970
as if it had been

709
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:43,000
sewn together with a needle.

710
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:56,450
Oh, it's you.

711
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,330
I

712
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,600
didn't plan to see you today.

713
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,720
What a coincidence.

714
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:06,630
I didn't come to see you on purpose either.

715
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:23,570
Aren't you human maids

716
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:25,040
supposed to be living on Xiaoxiang Peak?

717
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,330
Why are you following me?

718
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,920
It's along the way.

719
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:29,530
You say that, but do you know

720
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:30,360
where I'm going?

721
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,200
It's in the same direction anyway.

722
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:06,930
Are you afraid of walking at night?

723
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:10,159
Of course not.

724
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,360
Then you're afraid of ghosts?

725
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,000
There are no ghosts in this world.

726
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:16,760
If there are gods in this world,

727
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:18,489
how can there be no ghosts?

728
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,120
That's because after the war between gods and demons,

729
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:22,239
Deity Taihe

730
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:23,750
suppressed the demon clan with primordial power.

731
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:24,920
The Demon Lord is dead.

732
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,290
All evil and darkness in this world

733
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:27,370
have been dispersed.

734
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,250
What day is it today?

735
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:35,280
The White Robe Festival.

736
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:40,730
We of the Youhu Clan have no cemeteries.

737
00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:42,960
After death, we are refined into ashes

738
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:44,570
and scattered under peach trees,

739
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,889
becoming spring soil

740
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,239
to nourish the peach wood.

741
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:48,560
So we believe

742
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,800
that every peach blossom

743
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:51,949
is another continuation of life.

744
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,480
Every peach blossom

745
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:57,130
is also our blood relative.

746
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,080
I came to pay respects to my ancestors.

747
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,640
What are you here for?

748
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:10,360
And you say you're not afraid.

749
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:12,440
You don't understand.

750
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:14,000
I'm not afraid,

751
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:17,340
I just don't like this atmosphere.

752
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:21,490
Still not afraid?

753
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:45,070
What are you looking for?

754
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:46,380
Search thoroughly for me.

755
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:47,070
Yes.

756
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,280
The patrol discovered

757
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,600
someone performing curse rituals on the back mountain.

758
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:04,390
They were said to be wearing

759
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:06,240
the attire of our Xiaoxiang Peak maids.

760
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:08,480
Today, we'll take a good look

761
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:10,850
at who harbors evil intentions

762
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,200
and seeks their own demise.

763
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,340
Search carefully.

764
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:14,020
Yes.

765
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:49,450
Madam, we haven't found anything.

766
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,040
Tanyin.

767
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,850
Tanyin, are you asleep?

768
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,600
I have something to ask you.

769
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,730
Tanyin, did you take

770
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:42,170
my things?

771
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,800
What things?

772
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,600
My luggage.

773
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,160
I didn't take it.

774
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:47,970
Is there anything

775
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:49,450
important in your luggage?

776
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:50,560
If there is,

777
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,050
you can report to the instructor

778
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,520
and ask her to help you find it.

779
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:04,080
[Liujiao Palace]

780
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:06,830
General Chiyi!

781
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:19,180
Catch him!

782
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:19,940
Commander...

783
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:21,280
General Chiyi was poisoned.

784
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:22,150
Go report this immediately!

785
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:22,920
Anyone who runs into him

786
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:23,800
should first protect themselves.

787
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,250
Then try to capture him if possible!

788
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:25,940
Understood!

789
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:29,360
What's wrong?

790
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:31,340
Something happened.

791
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:42,800
Chiyi?

792
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:44,330
He's not Chiyi!

793
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:45,660
What do you mean

794
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:46,450
he's not Chiyi?

795
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:47,800
He wreaked havoc in the Jinxia Palace

796
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,040
and injured many of our people

797
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,400
as if he were controlled by someone.

798
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:55,280
Hey, bastard,

799
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:57,690
we meet again.

800
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,960
What tricks are you playing?

801
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:01,200
Too bad

802
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:03,150
that I missed my strike.

803
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,480
So

804
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:08,090
I still can't kill you today.

805
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:11,010
I'm here to annihilate you,

806
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,520
every last one of you!

807
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,480
Just you wait.

808
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:22,440
This is just the beginning.

809
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:36,990
Yuanzhong,

810
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,630
we'll be back!

811
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:44,560
Chiyi!

812
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:46,570
Could this be the War Demons'

813
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:47,580
possessing technique?

814
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:49,780
Go to Tianqu Peak and find Elder Dingxu now!

815
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:50,450
-Got it. -Got it.
