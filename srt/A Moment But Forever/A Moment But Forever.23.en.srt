[A Moment But Forever]

2
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:47,140
[Episode 23]

3
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,350
Come with me.

4
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:56,789
-Snitching, huh?
-Snitching, huh?

5
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:57,840
-How dare you!
-How dare you!

6
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,509
Stop!

7
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,950
I want him.

8
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:47,640
[Master Yan's Mansion]

9
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:02,830
This isn't right.

10
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,650
[Master Yan of the human race, Guan Zhi]

11
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,180
Not right. Not right.

12
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,080
Something's off.

13
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,120
What's not right?

14
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,750
Master.

15
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,080
You came at the right time.

16
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,190
Take a look at this drawing.

17
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,400
Master.

18
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,520
The servants told me

19
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,360
that you haven't had

20
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,870
a proper meal in days.

21
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,710
Can't you eat first

22
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,630
before working on the drawing?

23
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,079
I can't even finish the drawing.

24
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:24,560
How can I have the mood to eat?

25
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,150
Come on, take a look.

26
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,079
I've always said

27
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,340
you're suited for learning craftsmanship.

28
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,470
But you insist on taking over your father's position.

29
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,970
What a waste of talent.

30
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,030
There are thousands of craftsmen in Yandu City,

31
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,190
and you have students all over the world, Master.

32
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,520
You won't miss just one like me.

33
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,590
But I'm my father's

34
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,430
only son.

35
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,310
Your father has obtained

36
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,960
the immortal pill from the Youhu Clan.

37
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,710
After he comes out of seclusion this time,

38
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,590
he'll have several decades of good life ahead.

39
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,240
Between you two,

40
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,400
it's hard to say who will die first.

41
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,910
You don't need to rush to take over.

42
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,870
Master, your words...

43
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,050
Are absolutely right.

44
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:12,840
Of course, my father will

45
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,030
live a long life.

46
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,430
You too, Master.

47
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,680
I'm not that blessed.

48
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,750
I don't know if I'll ever have the chance

49
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,310
in this lifetime

50
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,800
to have a read of the Wushuang Secret Manual.

51
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,600
Master, you're still looking for the Wushuang Secret Manual?

52
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,950
Isn't that just a rumor?

53
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,950
If that rumor is false,

54
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,680
then these questions in my mind

55
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,950
might never be resolved in this lifetime.

56
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:41,930
Oh, by the way, Master.

57
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,240
Has Shen Ying

58
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,310
been here recently?

59
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,270
He hasn't been here for quite some time.

60
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,040
He's also your disciple.

61
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:54,750
He used to serve you diligently

62
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,870
and was very respectful.

63
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,170
I suppose he must have been too busy lately.

64
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,190
Why?

65
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:02,920
Did he offend you?

66
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,360
No, Master, you're being too serious.

67
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,680
He brought Dai

68
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,000
and the immortal pill back.

69
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,000
It's fair to say his achievements are outstanding.

70
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,750
Father has entrusted him with important responsibilities.

71
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,040
Recently, in the city,

72
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,870
he's also taken on the role of the Imperial Guard Commander.

73
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:16,050
He's been very busy.

74
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,680
Everyone's busy with their own affairs.

75
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,000
That's good.

76
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,040
What's in that box you brought?

77
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,290
So mysterious.

78
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,480
If I didn't ask, you wouldn't take it out, would you?

79
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,430
On my way here, I passed by Qiju Pavilion

80
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,360
and found it interesting.

81
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,120
So I bought it.

82
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:34,230
Master.

83
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:48,710
Thriving and prosperous, making money hand over fist.

84
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,820
Exquisite.

85
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,480
Master.

86
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,070
Even in a random utensil shop,

87
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,650
we can find such craftsmanship.

88
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,800
It shows that

89
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,830
our race is full of talented individuals.

90
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,470
There's great potential in craftsmanship.

91
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,510
Master.

92
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,040
As long as we work together with one heart and mind,

93
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,480
given time,

94
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,800
why should we worry about the human race not thriving?

95
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,890
Exquisite.

96
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,870
Truly exquisite.

97
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:29,060
This is the house I've rented.

98
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,800
Come on in.

99
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:34,560
How is it? Not bad, right?

100
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,680
It's really spacious.

101
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,360
There are several rooms here.

102
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,610
This one here is where I live.

103
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,040
Those two are empty.

104
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,240
I was thinking of renting them out,

105
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,240
and you came.

106
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,270
Isn't that a coincidence?

107
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,720
They can all be cleaned up later.

108
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,190
Look.

109
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:55,510
How's this room?

110
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,680
You can stay in this room.

111
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,830
I just moved in not long ago,

112
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:05,950
and I only cleaned up the main room.

113
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,720
This room can be lived in after a quick clean.

114
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,800
The owners of this place are surnamed Liu.

115
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:11,490
They're also well acquainted with my family.

116
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,800
Their entire family moved away recently,

117
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,310
so this house became vacant.

118
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,600
Knowing I wanted to rent a place,

119
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,950
they rented it to me at a good price.

120
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,240
This side room

121
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,070
used to be

122
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:23,960
where their second daughter lived.

123
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,660
She liked to arrange flowers and plants.

124
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,240
Those in the courtyard

125
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,040
were also planted by that Miss Liu before.

126
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,800
So this was a young lady's boudoir.

127
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,000
Sir.

128
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,040
Just stay here comfortably and recover.

129
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:40,530
You're Tanyin's friend,

130
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,680
which makes you my friend too.

131
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,480
In one's lifetime,

132
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,390
everyone has difficult times

133
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,430
when the path ahead seems narrow.

134
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,070
Hold your breath and endure it.

135
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:49,120
With a broad mind, the world becomes broad.

136
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,270
Thank you, Xue.

137
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,190
We'll pay you the rent.

138
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,000
Alright.

139
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,310
If I don't let you pay,

140
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,720
you probably won't feel comfortable staying here.

141
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,600
Don't worry.

142
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,240
I'll definitely take good care of him.

143
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:03,900
I'll go make some delicious food.

144
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,330
Have dinner here, alright?

145
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,680
You wait here for a moment.

146
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,830
I'll go tidy up a bit.

147
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,950
You've finished cleaning?

148
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,270
Do you need my help?

149
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,830
No need, you rest.

150
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:26,950
Just relax and wait for dinner.

151
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,480
Tanyin,

152
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,950
who is he?

153
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,870
He's kind of a friend of mine.

154
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,640
His name is Qian Lin.

155
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:34,630
Qian Lin?

156
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,390
That's quite a nice name.

157
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,270
I noticed he doesn't talk much.

158
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:39,789
He wasn't like this before.

159
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,150
Don't worry.

160
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,480
I'll take good care of him.

161
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,960
He probably won't stay for long.

162
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,490
I'll make time to come over every day.

163
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,550
Xue, sorry for the trouble.

164
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,420
There's no trouble at all.

165
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,550
Xue bought a set of old clothes

166
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,720
from the neighbor next door.

167
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,030
You can change into them later.

168
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,030
Qian Lin.

169
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,670
We've come to know each other.

170
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,840
Since I met you,

171
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,320
I won't turn a blind eye.

172
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,240
If you're willing,

173
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,390
you can stay.

174
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,550
If you don't want to and wish to leave,

175
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,550
you're also free to do so.

176
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,750
Get some rest first.

177
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,910
You're letting me stay just like this?

178
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,550
I am a War Demon.

179
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,480
So what if you're a War Demon?

180
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,610
War Demons are people too.

181
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,360
Take care, you two. Please come again.

182
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,000
Okay.

183
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,670
Sir,

184
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,320
are you waiting for someone?

185
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:25,000
You must be waiting for your wife, right?

186
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,790
You're truly blessed, Sir.

187
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:31,720
Your wife

188
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,480
is both gentle and virtuous.

189
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,000
She leaves early and returns late every day.

190
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,120
I heard she works at Qiju Pavilion

191
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,510
as a craftsman, right?

192
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,580
That's impressive. Truly impressive.

193
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,080
This is really enviable.

194
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,420
Oh, by the way, Sir,

195
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,000
it's raining outside.

196
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,390
Did you bring an umbrella?

197
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,270
♫Listening♫

198
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:16,790
♫Toona leaves knock fireflies into a vase♫

199
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,780
♫Ripples faintly spreading♫

200
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,040
♫In the pavilion in the clouds♫

201
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:24,030
♫Warm wine brews to the sound of the zither♫

202
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:28,690
♫The fragrance lingers like brush strokes, sketching out your form♫

203
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,580
♫Tonight♫

204
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:34,600
♫In a light intoxication, I feel the longing in the crystalline snow♫

205
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,470
♫I cannot bear to think of you♫

206
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,750
Yuanzhong!

207
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,500
♫I only wish♫

208
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,350
♫That the years would remain ever sunny♫

209
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:40,600
What's this?

210
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,480
It's a treasure basin. I just bought it.

211
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,930
♫So that, within the drifting light, I could share the breeze with you♫

212
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,960
Are you here to pick me up?

213
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,360
Where's Xiu?

214
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,510
♫The wind blows♫

215
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,200
At the noodle shop.

216
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:48,930
♫It stirs the scenery♫

217
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,910
You left him there alone?

218
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,680
♫It awakens our heart♫

219
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,120
Aren't you worried he might get lost?

220
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:54,350
♫It makes me certain that you are my destiny♫

221
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,240
You wish.

222
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,200
Who would steal him?

223
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,220
♫The closer we get♫

224
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:56,440
Let's go.

225
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,850
♫The more it feels like a dream♫

226
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,240
♫And the more I look intoxicated♫

227
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:03,590
♫I cannot fully express my yearning for you♫

228
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,720
♫The wind blows♫

229
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,500
♫It blows away the shadows of the clouds♫

230
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,200
♫It makes the moon seem even brighter♫

231
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:12,400
♫It makes me wake up from a dream♫

232
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,650
♫The wind blows♫

233
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,270
♫It reddens my eyes♫

234
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,300
♫It warms the promise we made♫

235
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,930
♫In the wind, we gently♫

236
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,640
♫Drift into a better place♫

237
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,870
Young lady, you're back.

238
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,980
Thank you for looking after Xiu for us.

239
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,910
So the little one is called Xiu?

240
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,090
He looks sturdy and strong.

241
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,150
Quite adorable.

242
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,100
Oh, by the way,

243
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:45,000
are you two having noodles today as well?

244
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:46,510
Yes.

245
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,260
Alright then.

246
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:52,750
I got paid today.

247
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,840
Although I spent some,

248
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,030
there's still quite a bit left.

249
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:55,860
I went and

250
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:57,130
exchanged it for gold beans.

251
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:03,060
Today, Xiu

252
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,660
can finally eat a bit more.

253
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,030
You go sit down first.

254
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:10,090
I'll go wash my hands.

255
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:11,090
Okay.

256
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,220
Your noodles are here.

257
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:48,970
Thank you.

258
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,910
What's wrong with him?

259
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,120
He ate the gold beans but didn't get full,

260
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,190
and now he's throwing a tantrum.

261
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,510
Do we really not need to go look for him?

262
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,370
It's alright.

263
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,120
After he's done with his tantrum,

264
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,150
he'll be back soon.

265
00:13:59,170 --> 00:13:59,960
Let's eat the noodles.

266
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:08,570
Tell me,

267
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,170
why doesn't he grow no matter how much he eats?

268
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:13,720
Why do you want him to grow up?

269
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:17,840
Why, you ask?

270
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:19,270
Aren't we staying here

271
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:21,030
in order to raise him?

272
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:26,670
What's wrong?

273
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,270
Nothing.

274
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,630
I guess I'm still not earning enough.

275
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,320
If children don't eat well,

276
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,740
their health will suffer.

277
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,630
He's a weapon spirit,

278
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,960
not a child.

279
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:46,670
Yuanzhong.

280
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:48,600
Yuanzhong!

281
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,840
Yuanzhong! Yuan-

282
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,000
I've finally found you.

283
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,450
So this... This is your-

284
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:05,030
You two-

285
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,550
He's a weapon spirit, named Xiu.

286
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,740
Oh, so he's a weapon spirit.

287
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,490
Looks quite cute.

288
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,550
How did you think of

289
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,490
coming to Yandu to find me?

290
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,120
I originally came down the mountain

291
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:18,080
to find a place for cultivation.

292
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:18,750
But unexpectedly,

293
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,120
I ran into Zi Fei and the others on the way.

294
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,600
That guy asked me to come help you.

295
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,390
He said when he left,

296
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:23,550
he didn't leave you enough money,

297
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:24,790
so he asked me to bring you some.

298
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,440
That's really kind of you. Thank you so much.

299
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,910
Now that we have money,

300
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,540
Xiu can finally eat his fill.

301
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,350
How did you find me?

302
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,240
How did I find you?

303
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,030
I've been wandering around the city for several days.

304
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:38,720
I just ran into

305
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,620
this child on the road.

306
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,240
Right,

307
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,390
I smelled your scent on him.

308
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:42,420
I followed the scent all the way here.

309
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,630
What a dog nose you have.

310
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:48,020
Xiu!

311
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,840
Xiu!

312
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,360
He ran away?

313
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,120
Xiu!

314
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:58,790
Whose child is this?

315
00:15:58,790 --> 00:15:59,750
I'm sorry.

316
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:00,790
Xiu!

317
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:01,790
What's going on?

318
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:02,600
Xiu!

319
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:06,480
My wine!

320
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,270
You've caused trouble again.

321
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:08,000
Pay for it!

322
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,080
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

323
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,360
I'll compensate you.

324
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,350
Quick, give me the money pouch.

325
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,360
It's gone.

326
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,240
Xiu, spit it out now.

327
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,440
Xiu, listen to me.

328
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,600
Spit it out right now. Be a good boy.

329
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,660
Or I'll have to spank you.

330
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,440
This little guy has really caused trouble.

331
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,360
Yeah, what kind of upbringing is this?

332
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,110
Let me tell you something.

333
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:33,440
You can't just eat without growing taller.

334
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,240
You understand?

335
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,720
You need to grow up quickly.

336
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:38,610
Here, this is for you.

337
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,270
This isn't for eating.

338
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,120
This is for playing with.

339
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,690
It's not made of gold, you know?

340
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:02,300
Yuanzhong, look.

341
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,440
Yuanzhong.

342
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,510
Yuanzhong?

343
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,270
Oh, right.

344
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,839
Zi Fei asked me to pass on a message to you.

345
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:25,680
He said that after they break Ling Yao's

346
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,640
seal,

347
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,069
they'll go to the Five Extremities on their own.

348
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,480
They won't come to meet you.

349
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,960
But even if they didn't come,

350
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,340
I had to come see you.

351
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,070
Otherwise, next time,

352
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:36,990
I might not see you again.

353
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:42,090
When little Xiu grows up,

354
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,030
you'll begin, right?

355
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,750
Yuanzhong.

356
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,540
Have you really made up your mind?

357
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,820
Sir, what would you like to eat?

358
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:14,160
Same as them.

359
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:14,880
Got it.

360
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:29,120
Darling, I'm back.

361
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,680
Why haven't you come home so late?

362
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,160
Xiu is already asleep.

363
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,740
I couldn't sleep, so I came out to find something to eat.

364
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,640
At this hour,

365
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,070
there are still so many customers here.

366
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:04,550
Yes.

367
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,640
The proprietress has been busy without a break.

368
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,750
This is the unique hustle and bustle of Yandu.

369
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:12,400
Madam, a bowl of wontons, please.

370
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:12,980
Sure.

371
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,160
What's wrong? You're not talking.

372
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:24,440
This place is quite nice.

373
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,000
You have a great eye for picking places.

374
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,030
Is that so?

375
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,750
I've been sitting here for three quarters of an hour,

376
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,420
and the proprietress has been busy for three quarters of an hour.

377
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,310
During this time,

378
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:35,270
her baby in the cradle

379
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,310
cried twice,

380
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,400
and the slightly older child

381
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,550
broke a bowl.

382
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,240
The proprietress has been so busy that she hasn't had a moment to rest.

383
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:41,920
She's been tending to the children while running the business,

384
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,160
and hasn't stopped to rest

385
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,160
for even a moment.

386
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,110
Her husband

387
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,750
came back reeking of alcohol,

388
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,200
not only refusing to help,

389
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,200
but nearly overturning the stall.

390
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,000
He looks like a leisurely customer,

391
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,070
acting absolutely not

392
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:54,880
like he should

393
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,960
as the man of the house.

394
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,960
All these trivial matters

395
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,110
are enough to weigh her down,

396
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,070
leaving her no peace.

397
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,000
Well, I think many things

398
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,400
can't be judged at first glance.

399
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,030
Look at this husband.

400
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,640
Although his clothes are old and worn,

401
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,830
even patched up,

402
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,640
his wife

403
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,960
and the two children's clothes

404
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,720
look much newer in comparison.

405
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:14,850
His feet

406
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,320
are covered in mud and water,

407
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,310
and his whole body is covered in dust.

408
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:19,830
He looks like

409
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:20,880
someone who does hard labor.

410
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,160
Although he smells of alcohol,

411
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,790
it seems

412
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,200
more like medicinal wine.

413
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:28,110
Perhaps he

414
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,680
finished a hard day's work,

415
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,680
applied some medicinal wine,

416
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,680
and due to exhaustion,

417
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:33,040
he fell asleep.

418
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:35,480
You always find a way

419
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,790
to see the better side of things.

420
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:39,680
Because even though there are

421
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,750
many bad people in this world,

422
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,440
there are also plenty of good ones.

423
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,510
Madam.

424
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,720
Coming.

425
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,720
Business is really good, isn't it?

426
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,720
It's always busiest at this time of day.

427
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,000
The craftsmen from the workshops finish their work,

428
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,640
and they come straight here

429
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,720
for some warm food.

430
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,240
Is that your husband?

431
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:58,400
Why does he let you

432
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,550
work so hard all by yourself?

433
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,640
Oh, him? He's exhausted from working all day.

434
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,590
I asked him to go home and get some good rest,

435
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:03,310
but he wouldn't.

436
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,550
He insisted on coming here to keep me company,

437
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,750
so that we could close up later together

438
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:06,830
and go home together.

439
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,160
You see?

440
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,960
Instead of guessing back and forth here,

441
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,030
worrying yourself,

442
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,960
why don't you just ask directly?

443
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,200
Their life

444
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,350
isn't as bad as you thought,

445
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,160
right?

446
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,270
The couple is loving,

447
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,160
and the family is harmonious.

448
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,070
So,

449
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,640
what's really bothering you?

450
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,750
Ever since we entered Yandu City,

451
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:33,200
you've been preoccupied

452
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,400
and gloomy.

453
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:36,640
Is there something on your mind?

454
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:40,920
Do you believe in fate?

455
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:42,680
Fate?

456
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,400
When I was born,

457
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:46,750
the Elders of my clan

458
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:47,750
read my fortune.

459
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,330
They said my life is cursed by the Seven Killings,

460
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,790
and I'm destined to encounter entanglements.

461
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:53,200
My life would be turbulent

462
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,640
and full of dangers.

463
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,160
If I focus on doing good,

464
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,830
perhaps in desperate situations,

465
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,270
I might glimpse a chance for survival.

466
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,480
But I must never give in to greed or attachment.

467
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:03,920
Once I desire something,

468
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,310
that chance for survival will vanish,

469
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,400
and even greater misfortune will follow.

470
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,750
Ji Tanyin.

471
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,160
Don't always try

472
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,270
to probe into others' minds

473
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:13,510
to figure out what they're really thinking.

474
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,440
After all,

475
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:17,920
you're not exactly an honest person yourself.

476
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:16,550
Ji Tanyin.

477
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,880
Don't always try

478
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,070
to probe into others' minds

479
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,310
to figure out what they're really thinking.

480
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,240
After all,

481
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:23,240
you're not exactly an honest person yourself.

482
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:51,030
[Dengyun House]

483
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,340
[Painter, Fu Jiuyun]

484
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,000
Xue.

485
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:30,960
I bought you some treats.

486
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,590
What?

487
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,070
You bought me treats?

488
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,410
What kind of treats?

489
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,350
The sweet cake.

490
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,390
I love that sweet cake.

491
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,510
And this, plum wine.

492
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,680
I'm afraid of getting drunk,

493
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,680
so I've never dared to try it.

494
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:43,610
It won't make you drunk. It's sweet.

495
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:44,760
You'll definitely like it.

496
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,880
Where's Qian Lin?

497
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,480
Oh, him? He sleeps all day,

498
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,880
hiding under the blanket, refusing to go out.

499
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:55,030
I think

500
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:56,880
he doesn't want me to go in and check on him.

501
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,860
Does he eat?

502
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:01,400
Yes, he eats everything I bring in.

503
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,480
He eats as much as I bring,

504
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,710
like he's a reincarnated hungry ghost or something.

505
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:05,720
Thank you for everything.

506
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:07,000
Don't mention it.

507
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:40,350
You're awake.

508
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:42,440
I've prepared

509
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,640
some pastries for you.

510
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:44,790
Come and try some.

511
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:52,400
Why did you fall asleep here?

512
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,960
Maybe I've been too tired lately.

513
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:58,850
Did you have a fight with the High Priest?

514
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:02,950
He seems to dislike me a bit lately.

515
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:04,110
Why?

516
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,750
Maybe because he thinks I'm not honest.

517
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,030
Is he honest?

518
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,920
Not really.

519
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,830
Then he's no better than you.

520
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:17,000
What right does he have to dislike you?

521
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,830
It's different.

522
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:21,400
Although he's not honest,

523
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:23,440
I know everything about him.

524
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:25,310
You know everything?

525
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:28,960
I doubt that.

526
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,070
Your magic source is broken?

527
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,270
Yes.

528
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,880
It's not a big deal.

529
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:43,200
Being an ordinary person is quite good.

530
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,240
I'll head back first.

531
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:56,160
Ji Tanyin.

532
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:01,200
Thank you for the pastries.

533
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,240
Rest well.

534
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,790
You're not angry anymore?

535
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:26,270
When was I ever angry?

536
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:31,200
Miss Ji, we meet again.

537
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:32,510
Come on in.

538
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:33,440
I'll treat you to a meal.

539
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,270
These are all specialties of our small restaurant.

540
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:40,830
Dear guests, please enjoy your meal.

541
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,720
How do you like these?

542
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:44,640
If you want to eat

543
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,200
or drink something else,

544
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:45,830
feel free to order.

545
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,110
It's my treat today anyway.

546
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:48,830
Thank you, Mei Shan.

547
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:50,880
Don't mention it, Miss Ji.

548
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,440
Well, one is my long-time old friend,

549
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,240
and the other is someone who bore heavenly thunder together with me.

550
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,240
A meal together is no big deal.

551
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,310
Is this the first time

552
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:00,000
you've been away from Baitou Mountain all these years?

553
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,030
Yes, indeed.

554
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:02,350
I've only stayed in the mountain

555
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,920
for a mere few decades.

556
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,070
I never expected the Mortal Realm

557
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:07,000
to have changed so much.

558
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,030
Come on, let's eat first,

559
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:10,920
to fill our stomachs a bit.

560
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,510
Today,

561
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:13,240
I've also invited another friend.

562
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,270
What friend?

563
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:15,690
You'll see when he arrives.

564
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,070
Look. Since you're trying this dish first,

565
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,750
it's easy to tell you're not a local.

566
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:26,680
This pouch pancake is the essence

567
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,070
of this table's fare.

568
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,240
As for this pouch pancake,

569
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,070
locals call it "sack pancake."

570
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,030
Since it's a "sack,"

571
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:34,480
you have to fill it with vegetables.

572
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,030
Like this.

573
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,590
That's how it's best eaten.

574
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:51,110
Here you go.

575
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:52,110
Thank you.

576
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,790
It tastes really good.

577
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,790
Miss Ji, you're truly appreciative.

578
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:03,160
No wonder Yuanzhong likes you.

579
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,960
Here, let me show you something interesting.

580
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:13,240
I bought this yesterday

581
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,680
when I was at the market.

582
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,550
This paper crane

583
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:17,830
can fly without any magic skills.

584
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,400
Besides, it's coated with Tung Oil,

585
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,680
so it won't get wet in the rain.

586
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,640
Isn't it amazing?

587
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,110
There's a piece of iron inside.

588
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:24,680
When the iron piece rotates,

589
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,310
it has an energy-storing effect.

590
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:27,200
When the energy is released,

591
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:27,830
it should be able to make

592
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:28,880
the wings of this paper crane

593
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,880
flap up and down.

594
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,640
However, it should only work once.

595
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,400
That's right.

596
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:33,750
The merchant who sold it to me

597
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:34,920
said the same thing.

598
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:38,590
On my way into the city,

599
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,790
in the mountains on the outskirts,

600
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:41,400
I saw a huge stone tower.

601
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,640
Black smoke was billowing from inside.

602
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,960
Do you know what it is?

603
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,070
We saw it on our way

604
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:46,030
into the city as well.

605
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:46,640
But we only

606
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,830
caught a glimpse from afar.

607
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,790
Is that some kind of workshop?

608
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:53,110
That's a metallurgy workshop.

609
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:54,680
It operates non-stop day and night,

610
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,590
and there are many mines around it.

611
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:58,030
They're all dug very deep.

612
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,590
But those who are mining the mines

613
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:00,590
are not humans.

614
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:01,480
Instead, they are

615
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,880
high-hanging iron hammers

616
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,440
and constantly spinning iron shovels.

617
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,510
I heard them call it

618
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:08,400
the Thunderbolt Device.

619
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,070
When we have the opportunity,

620
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:11,200
we can go take a look.

621
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:13,570
Have you been to the south of the city?

622
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,680
That's currently

623
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,270
the most prosperous area of Yandu.

624
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,680
People there travel

625
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,880
by stepping on a kind of

626
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:21,440
small wooden board with two wheels,

627
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:22,590
moving freely back and forth.

628
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:24,400
It's even more convenient than using magic skills.

629
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,440
On the eaves of many houses,

630
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,510
there hangs a kind of huge black umbrella.

631
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:29,550
It's said that those black umbrellas

632
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:30,240
can collect

633
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,550
heat from the sun

634
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,720
to keep people warm.

635
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,520
Wood and minerals are both limited resources,

636
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:36,830
and when they burn,

637
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,080
they release strange odors.

638
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,070
I didn't expect

639
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,550
them to start

640
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:41,720
looking for alternatives so soon.

641
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,310
Focus on eating.

642
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,000
Indeed.

643
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,070
It's truly a case of one day in the mountains,

644
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:46,660
a thousand years in the world.

645
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:47,880
Thanks to craftsmanship,

646
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,920
now ordinary families

647
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,590
can also live a good life.

648
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:53,350
Compared to magic skills which depend more on innate talent,

649
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:56,520
craftsmanship truly benefits all living beings.

650
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,780
That Goddess Wushuang

651
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,930
who's worshipped by the human race

652
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,540
truly has immeasurable merits.

653
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,200
Mr. Qi.

654
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,440
It's Mr. Qi.

655
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,720
Why is he here today?

656
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,790
Mr. Qi?

657
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:12,960
What?

658
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,000
You... You know him?

659
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,160
I've bought his paintings before.

660
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,270
What a coincidence.

661
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:19,640
Mr. Qi!

662
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:20,740
Mr. Qi!

663
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,790
Fu. Fu!

664
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:26,880
Over here.

665
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:30,110
How dashing.

666
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,030
Come on.

667
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:36,530
Let me introduce you to two good friends of mine.

668
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,310
This is Fu,

669
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:40,240
Fu Jiuyun.

670
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,240
I met him on my way

671
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:42,790
to Yandu.

672
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:44,030
We've shared a table and had drinks together a few times.

673
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:46,110
He's a man of refined taste.

674
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,200
I wouldn't say refined.

675
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,270
At most, it's just

676
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,350
a way to entertain myself

677
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:50,550
when I'm bored and free.

678
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,920
This is Yuanzhong,

679
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,160
a good friend of mine for many years.

680
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:56,510
This is Miss Ji, Ji Tanyin.

681
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:57,640
She's skilled in craftsmanship.

682
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,640
I'm not exaggerating.

683
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,200
Her skills are definitely among the best

684
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,070
in Yandu.

685
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:04,570
Ji Tanyin, right?

686
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:06,680
What a beautiful name.

687
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,240
Miss Ji.

688
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:11,450
I am Fu Jiuyun,

689
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,650
a painter.

690
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:14,750
I live alone here in Yandu,

691
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:16,350
without family, a wife, or children.

692
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,830
Are you a craftsman, Miss Ji?

693
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,880
To earn Mei Shan's praise,

694
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,900
you must be highly skilled.

695
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:23,920
As it happens,

696
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,070
I'm recently

697
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,000
quite interested in craftsmanship.

698
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:29,310
I wonder if I might have the opportunity

699
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:30,680
to visit you and seek your guidance?

700
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:35,310
Fu. Fu.

701
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,240
Come on, have a seat first.

702
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:36,830
Have some wine.

703
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:37,720
The wine here is quite good.

704
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,750
It's refreshing and not too strong.

705
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,000
Here, let me pour you some.

706
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:43,790
Is your name Fu Jiuyun?

707
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:44,960
That's correct.

708
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,440
But the people downstairs just now

709
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,750
all called you Mr. Qi.

710
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:48,590
I've mentioned that

711
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,790
I'm a painter.

712
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,680
So this name

713
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,960
is somewhat inconvenient.

714
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,750
But of course,

715
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,480
you can call me

716
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:55,520
whatever you like, Miss.

717
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:56,440
I bought a treasure basin

718
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,750
from Qiju Pavilion before.

719
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,270
The fish in the painting come to life when they encounter water,

720
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,070
and return to being a painting when the water dries up.

721
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:03,400
Mr. Xu, the shopkeeper, said

722
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,960
it was Mr. Qi's work.

723
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,640
You're referring to that painting of the swimming fish, right?

724
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,720
That's right.

725
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:10,150
Indeed, it was my creation.

726
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,830
I didn't expect Mr. Xu

727
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:12,830
to have sold that painting

728
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:14,000
to you, Miss.

729
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,270
In that case,

730
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,160
we must be destined to meet.

731
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:18,880
If you like it,

732
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,960
I can give you a few more as gifts.

733
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,880
I have many such paintings at my residence.

734
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:24,110
Paintings of birds, beasts,

735
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:26,030
court ladies, flowers, and plants–I have them all.

736
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:27,110
If you have time, Miss,

737
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,590
you're welcome to come and appreciate them at my place.

738
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:33,750
Fu.

739
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,690
Come on, let's drink.

740
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:40,680
These past few days,

741
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,390
the weather has suddenly become hot,

742
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,180
hasn't it?

743
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,510
Isn't it weird?

744
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,030
Good wine.

745
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:47,960
Fine wine,

746
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:49,550
beautiful scenery,

747
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,790
with a beauty by my side.

748
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:52,880
Mei Shan.

749
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,680
Knowing you as a friend

750
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,940
is the greatest blessing

751
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:57,560
of my life.

752
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,440
Who would say otherwise?

753
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,880
Come on, let me introduce you to

754
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,750
this other friend of mine.

755
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,110
I didn't introduce him properly earlier

756
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:05,830
because I was afraid it might frighten you.

757
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,430
This one is quite formidable.

758
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:08,840
He's the nemesis of the War Demon

759
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,670
and the pillar of the Youhu Clan,

760
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:11,880
who broke through Pinghu Xianzhou

761
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,000
with just one palm strike,

762
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:13,920
the last remaining

763
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,190
god in this world,

764
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,360
Yuanzhong, the High Priest of the Youhu Clan.

765
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:18,440
Impressive, isn't it?

766
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:20,500
This one is actually his handmaiden.

767
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:22,510
They are... You know.

768
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:23,630
That kind of relationship.

769
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,830
The owner of the Divine Left Hand,

770
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:27,760
High Priest Yuanzhong.

771
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,560
My apologies, my apologies.

772
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:31,840
However, after the war between gods and demons,

773
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,800
no god has set foot again

774
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,760
in this mortal world.

775
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:36,920
So, as for

776
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,840
the claim of being the last god in the world,

777
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,880
High Priest, do you agree?

778
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,880
Is that painting in the dance house your work?

779
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:45,440
Painting?

780
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,800
The Goddess Painting.

781
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,440
The figure in that Goddess Painting

782
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,800
looks a lot like me.

783
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:54,840
Have you seen me before?

784
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:56,730
Not exactly.

785
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,360
What do you mean by "not exactly"?

786
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,590
I mean

787
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,030
we have never met in this world

788
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:03,800
with these appearances.

789
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:09,840
But I have seen you in my dreams,

790
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,000
more than once.

791
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:17,320
I wonder, Miss Ji,

792
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,280
have you ever seen me in your dreams?

793
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,710
Yuanzhong! Yuanzhong!

794
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,280
Yuanzhong! Yuan... Yuanzhong!

795
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,150
It seems someone here

796
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,150
doesn't fancy my presence.

797
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:34,400
Then I won't

798
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,690
disturb your pleasant gathering any longer.

799
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,320
Mei Shan,

800
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:40,800
thank you for the invitation.

801
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,360
Let's meet some other day.

802
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,550
Miss Ji,

803
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,400
until we meet again.

804
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,950
I'll... I'll see him out.

805
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:04,350
This is our shop's signature dish, Wealth Tree.

806
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,070
Esteemed guests, please have a taste.

807
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,590
Xiu.

808
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:11,760
This isn't a gold bean.

809
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,800
You can't eat it.

810
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:18,360
What are you grunting about?

811
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:24,150
Scholars and literati

812
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:26,440
are just so carefree.

813
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,150
Esteemed guests.

814
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:29,630
There's a letter for Miss Ji.

815
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:31,830
Don't open it!

816
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:34,280
Tonight between 7-9 pm,

817
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,530
at Rest Teahouse,

818
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,140
I'd like to invite you there for a chat, beauty.

819
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,570
I... I won't go.

820
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,630
I won't go, either.

821
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:55,030
Gentleman.

822
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,510
What have you taken a fancy to?

823
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,550
Who made this five-wheel fan?

824
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,440
You have a good eye, Gentleman.

825
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,360
This five-wheel fan

826
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,630
was made by the Zhuang's of our Tongtian Workshop.

827
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:07,800
Their five-wheel fans

828
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,880
are exquisitely made, sturdy and durable.

829
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,480
One person operating it can cool an entire room.

830
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:14,920
It's most suitable for summer heat relief.

831
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,590
This isn't Old Zhuang's craftsmanship.

832
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,070
This...

833
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,670
What do you mean by that, Gentleman?

834
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,030
Are you accusing me

835
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:26,400
of selling fakes?

836
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:27,710
My Qiju Pavilion

837
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,710
has been operating in Yandu for decades.

838
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:31,710
What we rely on is honest business practices.

839
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:32,980
Gentleman, you...

840
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:35,400
That's not what I meant.

841
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,150
I mean, this five-wheel fan

842
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:38,440
has been modified by someone else.

843
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,840
That person modified the connection point

844
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,440
between the chain and the axle,

845
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:42,920
making it easier to operate

846
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,550
and increasing the wind power.

847
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,960
Old Zhuang's craftsmanship is indeed exceptional,

848
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,360
but he's not good at innovation.

849
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:50,960
So this five-wheel fan

850
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:54,240
can no longer be considered his work.

851
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:56,320
I see.

852
00:37:58,030 --> 00:37:59,200
I misunderstood.

853
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:04,150
Someone gave this to me.

854
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,320
If I'm not mistaken,

855
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,860
these two items

856
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:14,920
should be crafted by the same person, right?

857
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,630
Your discernment is truly impressive, Gentleman.

858
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,030
These are indeed made by the same person.

859
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:23,110
Who is this person?

860
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:23,840
Well...

861
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,070
Where does this person live?

862
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,480
I only know it's a

863
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,280
young woman surnamed Ji.

864
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,820
As for where she lives specifically,

865
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:30,920
I really have no idea.

866
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,920
A young woman?

867
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,710
That's right.

868
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,880
This Miss Ji's craftsmanship is exceptional.

869
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:38,400
In my opinion,

870
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:40,630
she's even better

871
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:42,230
than many famous master craftsmen.

872
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,710
What?

873
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:48,230
Do you have prejudice against women, Gentleman?

874
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:49,720
That would be weird.

875
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,400
Here in Yandu,

876
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:53,820
we don't practice male superiority.

877
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,150
As long as one is educated

878
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:56,150
and has learned a craft,

879
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:57,030
regardless of gender,

880
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:59,000
they can make a living.

881
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:01,510
After all, the ancestor of our craftsmanship,

882
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,230
Goddess Wushuang,

883
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:06,190
was also a woman.

884
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,250
You've misunderstood, Sir.

885
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,760
I'm just curious

886
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:13,340
how such a young lady

887
00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:15,160
could have such remarkable skills.

888
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:19,070
It's truly a case of the new generation surpassing the old,

889
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:22,710
and the young outshining their predecessors.

890
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,150
In that case, I apologize for my rudeness.

891
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:26,800
Sir.

892
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:30,590
If that young lady comes to your shop again,

893
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,480
please keep her here.

894
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:33,880
This...

895
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:36,120
Just tell her someone admires her craftsmanship

896
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:38,120
and wishes to meet her.

897
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:39,590
That won't be difficult.

898
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,280
Miss Ji comes to my shop

899
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,800
every few days.

900
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:43,960
However, I don't know

901
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,510
where you live, Gentleman.

902
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:46,670
If she comes,

903
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:48,420
how should I find you?

904
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:51,220
Just come find me at Master Yan's Mansion.

905
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,440
Master Yan's Mansion?

906
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:56,510
Guan Zhi, Master Yan's Mansion.

907
00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:00,010
Yan... Master Yan?

908
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:23,000
What are you thinking about?

909
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,090
You're here.

910
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:26,400
You didn't hear me knocking just now,

911
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:27,800
so I came in directly.

912
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,070
That guy's identity is suspicious.

913
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:33,440
You're not allowed to meet him.

914
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:35,920
I won't go.

915
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:37,440
If you run into him outside,

916
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:38,960
you're not allowed to talk to him either.

917
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,960
If he speaks to me,

918
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,400
am I not allowed to respond?

919
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,070
I won't talk to him.

920
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,960
Let's go eat.

921
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:51,550
I'm not going.

922
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,110
Why?

923
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:56,360
I'm not hungry yet.

924
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:13,280
What's this for?

925
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,400
I'll go wash Xiu's feet.

926
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:17,470
Wash his feet?

927
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:13,710
