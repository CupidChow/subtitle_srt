[A Moment But Forever]

2
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,200
[Episode 12]

3
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:07,750
You're awake.

4
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,950
Are you feeling uncomfortable anywhere?

5
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:15,710
No.

6
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:22,460
You were severely injured.

7
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,870
It's better for you to rest in bed.

8
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,710
I'm fine now.

9
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:33,750
This is my friend Mei Shan's residence.

10
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,630
He was the one who underwent the lightning tribulation.

11
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:36,910
Lightning tribulation?

12
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:43,430
Are you alright then?

13
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,590
A tribulation's force is immense

14
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,070
and you were sealed away for so long.

15
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,910
Your essence blood has been severely depleted.

16
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:52,990
How could you disregard yourself

17
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:54,510
and take on someone else's calamity?

18
00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:55,950
Do you have a death wish?

19
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:00,150
Apart from creating things,

20
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,550
what other skills do you have?

21
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,510
And how dare you

22
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:03,670
block a lightning strike for me?

23
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,030
I'm different.

24
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:06,190
How are you different?

25
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,190
I made a promise

26
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,510
to protect you well.

27
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:09,390
Of course, I can't let you

28
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,870
lose your life right before my eyes.

29
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,110
However,

30
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:14,310
you need to learn

31
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,700
to protect yourself well.

32
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,390
I can't save you again.

33
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,190
If you encounter such a problem again,

34
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,070
I won't be able to intervene.

35
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:23,190
Who did you promise?

36
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:25,620
When did you promise them?

37
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,280
And why can't you intervene again?

38
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,360
I can't tell you.

39
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,150
You...

40
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,270
Is this Baitou Mountain?

41
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,310
You've been here before?

42
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,380
Yes, I have.

43
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:42,960
But before,

44
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,220
this wasn't the name.

45
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:10,790
Something's not right.

46
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:12,670
What's not right?

47
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,550
I used divination

48
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,430
to calculate Tanyin's fortune for this journey.

49
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:18,310
The result shows it's still a mix of good and bad luck,

50
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,390
unclear and obscure.

51
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,350
It's exactly the same as the previous result,

52
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:22,500
with no changes.

53
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:23,550
How could that be?

54
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,990
Then how do you explain Tanyin's dream?

55
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,340
We are gods.

56
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:28,680
We don't simply have

57
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,910
insignificant dreams.

58
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,950
What do you think?

59
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,390
Didn't Tanyin say

60
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,550
the High Priest

61
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:36,110
almost killed her in her dream?

62
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,270
Isn't it obvious?

63
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,870
This person stole the Divine Hand

64
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:40,950
and killed countless people.

65
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,860
He must have learned Tanyin's identity

66
00:04:42,909 --> 00:04:45,190
and decided to strike first to kill the god and seize the Divine Hand.

67
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,390
It's not impossible.

68
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:49,480
How can you interpret it

69
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,909
so simplistically and crudely?

70
00:04:50,909 --> 00:04:52,120
In Tanyin's dream,

71
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,860
there was also Deity Taihe.

72
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,510
If it's what you said,

73
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,750
then how do you explain Taihe's presence?

74
00:04:58,590 --> 00:04:59,390
Hannv,

75
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,430
I know you're worried about Taihe,

76
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,340
but the five Preceptors of Discipline

77
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,870
of the Discipline Hall

78
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,630
have already made their decision.

79
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:10,270
We can only obey.

80
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,650
This... this...

81
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,550
May I ask where you're from

82
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:26,810
and which clan you belong to?

83
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,190
I'm from Pingzhou. I'm of the human race.

84
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:31,820
Pingzhou?

85
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:33,670
Pingzhou...

86
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,870
Are there any... any immortal caves there?

87
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:38,830
Did your ancestors

88
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,440
also have this kind of

89
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,630
talent for resurrection?

90
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:48,230
I see that you have extraordinary potential

91
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:49,790
and you're not afraid of the harm from heavenly lightning.

92
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,150
I wonder if you've had any

93
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:54,190
extraordinary encounters?

94
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:55,630
No, I haven't.

95
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,990
Then, then, then...

96
00:05:59,190 --> 00:05:59,990
Is it

97
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,550
related to the techniques you've practiced?

98
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:02,940
Can't you ask something useful?

99
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:06,230
Haven't...

100
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:08,110
Haven't you been suspicious of her all along?

101
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:09,230
I was just asking on your behalf, wasn't I?

102
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,180
Mind your own business.

103
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,910
Hey, you're so ungrateful.

104
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:13,630
I'm thinking for you.

105
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:14,710
She took

106
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:15,550
such a big risk for you,

107
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:16,190
suffering the lightning,

108
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:16,950
and saved your life.

109
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:17,910
Yet you're still here,

110
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:18,550
questioning her.

111
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:19,550
Where are your manners?

112
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,550
I didn't ask.

113
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:22,670
You didn't ask?

114
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:23,590
Even just thinking about it

115
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:24,630
is impolite.

116
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:26,110
What's your relationship with her now?

117
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,710
This is a life-and-death relationship.

118
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:29,390
Yet you keep suspecting her.

119
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:30,550
You're utterly heartless.

120
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:31,630
Utterly heartless.

121
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:32,510
Mei Shan,

122
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,830
I called you here to check her legs.

123
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:35,990
If you're not going to treat her,

124
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,390
then get out.

125
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:39,909
Understood, understood.

126
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,110
How is it?

127
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,590
Pardon my frankness,

128
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,940
but the nerves and muscles in her legs are severely damaged.

129
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:06,550
I'm afraid

130
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:09,210
there's no possibility of recovery.

131
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,710
Even you can't do anything?

132
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,300
I can make her a pair of crutches.

133
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,090
Does that count?

134
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:18,750
Don't worry.

135
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:19,750
I'll be fine.

136
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:20,990
It's okay.

137
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,270
If he can't cure you,

138
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,750
I'll find someone else to treat you.

139
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:24,990
There must be a way.

140
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:26,750
I believe you.

141
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,430
Excuse me, you two,

142
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,390
could you please respect

143
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:31,350
my diagnosis?

144
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,110
If I say

145
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,030
these legs can't be cured,

146
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:33,950
no one can make it happen.

147
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,070
Didn't you say yesterday

148
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,510
that if she could come back to life,

149
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:37,710
you'd take off your head

150
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:38,920
and use it as a stool?

151
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:39,550
Go on.

152
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:40,750
Children should be seen but not heard.

153
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,030
If you don't speak, no one will miss you.

154
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:43,470
Thank you,

155
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,430
but I still prefer to believe

156
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,510
what Yuanzhong said.

157
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:48,710
Young lady,

158
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,510
I have a question

159
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,150
I'd like to discuss with you.

160
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,750
This selfless spirit of yours,

161
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,860
this noble quality of sacrificing yourself for others,

162
00:07:58,470 --> 00:07:59,909
is it innate

163
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:01,630
or acquired later in life?

164
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:03,100
To be honest,

165
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,030
I'd like to be friends with you.

166
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,230
The kind that can withstand heavenly thunder for me.

167
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:09,820
Zi Fei.

168
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,800
Young lady, listen to me.

169
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,550
To be frank…

170
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:13,360
Go, go, go.

171
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,620
When I saw your brave act

172
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,350
of facing the thunder,

173
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,350
I developed

174
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:17,550
a deep admiration for you!

175
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:18,670
Young lady, let's be friends!

176
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:19,190
Let's go.

177
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:19,550
Young lady!

178
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:20,270
Go out!

179
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:21,260
Young lady!

180
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,870
That's just how Mei Shan is.

181
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:25,990
He's a bit crazy.

182
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:27,510
Don't take it to heart.

183
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,020
Wh-Why are you staring at me?

184
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:44,179
I just have a lot of questions I want to ask you.

185
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:46,070
But I also know

186
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:47,540
that even if I ask,

187
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:49,490
there won't be any answers.

188
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,030
Are you hungry?

189
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:59,270
A little.

190
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,310
I'll go get you something to eat.

191
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:17,390
Reporting to the deity,

192
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,630
I have dispatched the elites of our clan.

193
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,910
We vow to reclaim the God-Slaying Dagger.

194
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,610
Please

195
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,710
give my clan one more chance.

196
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,430
You don't even know

197
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:29,390
if your clansmen are alive or dead.

198
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,190
How will you find them

199
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,780
and reclaim the God-Slaying Dagger?

200
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:35,070
The mortal realm is vast,

201
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:36,320
with countless living beings.

202
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,750
With your current

203
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:38,960
manpower and abilities,

204
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,550
trying to find the dagger

205
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,300
is like searching for a needle in the haystack.

206
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,710
How can I trust you?

207
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,140
If I may speak,

208
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,310
although our clan is in a difficult situation now,

209
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:49,710
we are not without allies.

210
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:52,230
I have sent people to contact them

211
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,150
and ask for their assistance.

212
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,870
There's no time.

213
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:58,030
We must prepare for both possibilities.

214
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:00,230
I've heard that the War Demon Clan

215
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,350
has a secret technique

216
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,630
called Possessing.

217
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:05,150
It's said that if certain conditions are met,

218
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,630
one can control someone's body

219
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,100
from thousands of miles away,

220
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,550
making them live

221
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,070
or die at will.

222
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,590
Is this true?

223
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:13,670
Yes.

224
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,020
What are those necessary conditions

225
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:16,630
that must be met?

226
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,590
War Demons?

227
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:36,830
Do you really want to use them

228
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:38,900
to perform the possessing technique against Yuanzhong?

229
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:40,870
If they were capable of succeeding,

230
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:42,470
they wouldn't have been chased

231
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:43,440
for so many years,

232
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:45,310
unable to see the light of day.

233
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:47,230
I have my own considerations in what I do.

234
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,720
There's no need for you to worry.

235
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,470
Still don't feel anything?

236
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:36,710
But you don't need to worry.

237
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,310
I'm just too badly injured.

238
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:39,270
It will take some time

239
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,270
to recover.

240
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,110
I'm not worried.

241
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,470
It's just that if you don't get better,

242
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,350
I don't want to have a cripple

243
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:47,180
as a handmaiden.

244
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:00,060
Look, what a nice girl.

245
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,510
Her legs are so badly injured,

246
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:04,590
yet she's still putting on a brave façade.

247
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,510
If I can't be friends with her,

248
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,480
it must be against the will of heaven

249
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,240
and I deserve to be struck by lightning.

250
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,630
Are you really trying to

251
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,630
befriend her?

252
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,880
I'm almost embarrassed to expose your true intentions.

253
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,630
Why wouldn't I be?

254
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,310
Don't doubt my sincerity in making friends.

255
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:23,670
You have ulterior motives.

256
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,440
You just want her to help you bear the lightning.

257
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,660
I don't like what you're saying.

258
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:29,550
Let me ask you,

259
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,510
when making friends,

260
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:32,530
shouldn't we be open and honest with each other?

261
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:33,870
When a friend encounters difficulties,

262
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:35,900
shouldn't we be willing to go through thick and thin for them?

263
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:37,070
In the end,

264
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:37,990
you just want her

265
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,190
to help you bear the tribulation.

266
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,060
Young man,

267
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,750
you need to have a longer-term perspective.

268
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,390
If she encounters any difficulties in the future,

269
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:46,390
I will certainly rush to her aid without hesitation.

270
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:47,990
I'd even hold up

271
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:49,910
the sky for her if it fell, let alone bearing lightning,

272
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:52,950
Anyone can make empty promises.

273
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:54,750
I could even give my life for Yuanzhong.

274
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,110
What are you thinking about?

275
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:22,310
When do you plan to break the seal?

276
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,470
In the next few days.

277
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:29,910
You're ready?

278
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:34,790
Alright, then in the future,

279
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,150
if there's anything

280
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,310
you need me for,

281
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:39,070
just let me know.

282
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:40,550
I will.

283
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:44,390
Can't you show some courtesy?

284
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,020
I did it in my head.

285
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,230
I almost made myself sick.

286
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,380
What are

287
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,310
your plans for that girl?

288
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,350
I haven't decided yet.

289
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:08,630
Well, it seems

290
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:09,990
she has no future with you.

291
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,990
How about she stay and help me bear the lightning instead?

292
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,270
See?

293
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:15,410
You're reluctant to let her go, aren't you?

294
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:21,990
I can't figure her out.

295
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:24,590
Who doesn't have some secrets?

296
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:25,360
Don't you have any?

297
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,190
Don't I have any?

298
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,190
I mean, I don't know

299
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:30,030
what she's after.

300
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,470
She's after you, of course.

301
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,470
It's such a simple matter.

302
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:34,190
I think the girl

303
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:35,590
has fallen for you.

304
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:36,940
To protect you,

305
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,070
she's even willing to give up her life.

306
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:39,510
Where else would you find

307
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:41,070
such a devoted and good girl like her?

308
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:42,190
If it weren't for the fact that

309
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:44,470
my heart already belongs to someone else,

310
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,950
even I would be moved.

311
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:50,310
I'm telling you,

312
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:53,030
you should trust the judgment of someone who has experience.

313
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,750
Yuanzhong, you're still young.

314
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,390
You haven't seen such a situation before,

315
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,830
so it's understandable.

316
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:01,470
Don't take yourself

317
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:02,230
too seriously.

318
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,190
Of course,

319
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:04,670
you can't disregard

320
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,580
others' feelings either.

321
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:07,350
Feelings are something

322
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:08,760
that can disappear in an instant.

323
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,110
When that happens,

324
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,450
you won't even know who to cry to.

325
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:15,450
Seriously.

00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,390
Why didn't you stay in your room?

375
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:26,390
Why did you go there?

376
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,260
I-I was just

377
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,510
taking a bath.

378
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:30,720
After being unconscious for so long,

379
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,830
I must have smelled awful.

380
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:33,150
As for you,

381
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,470
as the High Priest of the Youhu Clan,

382
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:37,190
don't you know it's improper to peek?

383
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:38,790
How dare you stand there and watch?

384
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,350
I wasn't peeking.

385
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:42,670
I was just passing by.

386
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,150
Your legs are injured so badly.

387
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:47,470
How could you go so far?

388
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:50,100
A mechanical bird carried me there.

389
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:53,990
Hold on tight.

390
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,230
Here, have some water.

391
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:21,550
Thank you.

392
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,240
Here you go.

393
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,670
I'm fine.

394
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,480
Well then, you should rest.

395
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:48,790
I'll be going now.

396
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:50,550
Do you have something

397
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:51,630
you want to say to me?

398
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:56,150
No.

399
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:59,470
Then I have something to tell you.

400
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:01,430
Sit here.

401
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,430
Don't you have something to say?

402
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:25,430
What are you laughing about?

403
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:27,910
You don't want to send me away anymore,

404
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:28,710
do you?

405
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,370
Who told you that?

406
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,350
I can see it

407
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,430
in your eyes.

408
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:39,540
That's good.

409
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,430
At least that strike wasn't for nothing.

410
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:43,910
You have no idea

411
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,910
how painful that purple lightning was.

412
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,590
If there had been another strike,

413
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:49,550
I might have been reduced to ashes.

414
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:50,910
If you're afraid,

415
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,710
you should stay far away.

416
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:54,230
That won't do.

417
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,150
I have to follow you

418
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:56,350
and be with you.

419
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:16,790
Ji Tanyin.

420
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,080
You don't know me.

421
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,390
I do know you.

422
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,780
I think I'm the person in this world

423
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,030
who knows you best.

424
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:27,150
Why do you always say that?

425
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,190
Because I've seen it.

426
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,380
I don't even know what you're talking about.

427
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:34,430
You're so weird.

428
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:36,440
Anyway, even if you follow me,

429
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:38,830
you won't gain anything.

430
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:40,430
You can't change anything either.

431
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:45,990
When this matter is over,

432
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:48,470
I'll find someone to heal your legs.

433
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,870
Then, whether you stay or leave

434
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:53,190
will be entirely up to you.

435
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:54,870
I won't leave.

436
00:21:59,150 --> 00:21:59,940
If you follow me,

437
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,590
you'll still be a handmaiden.

438
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:02,850
That's already good enough for me.

439
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,000
Silly.

440
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:13,790
A new store has opened over there.

441
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:14,310
Really?

442
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,230
Let's go check it out sometime.

443
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:15,870
Okay.

444
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:20,460
They have a complete selection of items inside.

445
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,270
Is that so?

446
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:41,510
Miss, there's a gentleman

447
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:42,870
who invites you to dine with him.

448
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:48,430
Friends have come from afar.

449
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:49,840
Naturally, I'm delighted.

450
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:52,590
I've specially prepared a table of food and drinks

451
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:54,610
to welcome the three of you.

452
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,120
May our friendship stay evergreen,

453
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:58,750
as enduring as heaven and earth,

454
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,270
and as eternal as the sun and moon.

455
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:01,290
Come, eat up.

456
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:07,990
Please start eating.

457
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,470
No need to be so polite with me.

458
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,030
Excuse me, everyone.

459
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:14,270
Could someone please settle the bill for the food and drinks first?

460
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:20,550
Why are you looking at me?

461
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:21,190
Don't forget,

462
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:22,830
I still owe you half a year's worth of drink tabs.

463
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:23,470
You...

464
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,510
I don't have money either.

465
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,020
No way.

466
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,550
How long the light

467
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:35,950
of our friendship can last

468
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:37,260
all depends on you now.

469
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,790
Surely you won't

470
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:39,550
heartlessly

471
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:40,710
extinguish it over the cost of one meal, would you?

472
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:41,790
You should know

473
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,810
that in my heart,

474
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:44,890
I've always believed you to be a good person.

475
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:46,740
Does being a good person mean you must have money?

476
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,110
Besides,

477
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:48,790
wasn't this meal

478
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:49,830
supposed to be your treat for everyone?

479
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:50,430
Why must

480
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:51,500
someone else pay for you?

481
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,790
That's right, Mei Shan.

482
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:53,750
You're an immortal,

483
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:54,750
yet you've ended up like this.

484
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:56,030
Aren't you ashamed?

485
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,030
I don't want to be like this either.

486
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,590
Every 49 days,

487
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:01,910
I get struck by lightning once.

488
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,630
All my time is spent

489
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:05,550
enduring lightning, cultivating, and recovering from injuries.

490
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,820
How can I find time to make money?

491
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:11,540
How about we continue to put it on the tab?

492
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:13,520
Listen, you all,

493
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,710
you're immortals after all.

494
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:16,630
Surely you can't be unable

495
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:17,580
to scrape together the price of a meal, right?

496
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:18,550
Look.

497
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:19,630
What's so special about this?

498
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:20,750
You know me, don't you?

499
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:21,390
There are indeed immortals

500
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:22,670
so poor they can't even afford a meal.

501
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:24,380
Zi Fei.

502
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:32,870
Thank you, immortal.

503
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:37,910
Alright.

504
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:39,990
Then, this first cup of wine

505
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:43,540
is to toast me for surviving the tribulation.

506
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:45,790
Surely good fortune will follow.

507
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,940
The next tribulation is approaching soon.

508
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:50,270
For such matters,

509
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:51,670
we do our best and leave the rest to fate.

510
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,190
If all else fails, to hell with it.

511
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:54,630
Drink some wine, gaze at the sky,

512
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:56,270
and live one day at a time, right?

513
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:57,390
Come, let's drink.

514
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:00,630
Cheers!

515
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:11,430
Miss Ji is not good at drinking.

516
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:13,230
I usually do drink a little,

517
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:15,470
but this wine is really too strong.

518
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,510
That's because you haven't drunk enough.

519
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:18,070
Drink some more

520
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:19,070
and you'll even find it bland.

521
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:20,550
Don't listen to his nonsense.

522
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:22,870
Baitou Mountain is covered in snow year-round.

523
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:24,710
The local mountain dwellers brew this wine

524
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:26,430
specially to ward off the cold.

525
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:27,710
It's easy to get drunk if you have too much.

526
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,270
Then I won't drink anymore.

527
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:31,150
Eat more.

528
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,110
Thank you.

529
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:45,350
Why do you two

530
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,110
look sneaky?

531
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:47,710
Do we?

532
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:48,550
No.

533
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:57,470
It didn't break?

534
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:01,060
The material seems quite ordinary.

535
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:03,230
This is something you don't know.

536
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:04,650
Nothing on Baitou Mountain

537
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:06,190
can be damaged by external forces.

538
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:07,030
You won't be able to

539
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:08,230
pluck a single leaf

540
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:09,510
from the ordinary plants

541
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:10,590
in this room,

542
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:11,470
unless it falls down naturally.

543
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:12,550
Is that so?

544
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:13,510
Try it.

545
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,580
It seems there's an invisible force

546
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:22,890
protecting this place.

547
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:25,030
It's fortunate that it is so.

548
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:26,800
Otherwise, with me experiencing tribulations here year after year,

549
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,730
this mountain would have been struck by lightning and destroyed long ago.

550
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,590
Eat quickly. The food is getting cold.

551
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:39,670
Don't you like it?

552
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,430
I suddenly have a craving for roast goose.

553
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:48,150
You like roast goose?

554
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:50,350
Earlier on the tower ship,

555
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:51,860
I saw others eating roast goose

556
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,470
and thought it smelled delicious.

557
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:03,790
Are your legs better?

558
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,120
A little better.

559
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:08,310
But I feel

560
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:10,020
I can barely stand up.

561
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,190
However, I believe it will heal soon.

562
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:14,870
How can such a severe injury

563
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,430
heal?

564
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:34,740
What's wrong?

565
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,550
Perhaps when I stood up earlier,

566
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:39,540
I put too much strain on it,

567
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:41,750
so it's a bit painful now.

568
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:11,950
I'm only doing this because

569
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:13,710
you took a hit for me.

570
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:15,630
Don't overthink it.

571
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:20,830
By the way,

572
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:22,400
you and Mr. Mei Shan

573
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,540
seem to be good friends.

574
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:24,630
I guess.

575
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:25,750
Besides me,

576
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,550
no one else wants to be his friend.

577
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:29,750
I heard earlier

578
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:31,190
that you destroyed his cave dwelling

579
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,550
and had a fight with him.

580
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:33,790
How come

581
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:35,350
you're now good friends?

582
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,510
Because I showed mercy

583
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:39,190
and spared his miserable life.

584
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:41,440
He was grateful to me, worshipped me,

585
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:42,740
and kowtowed to me.

586
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:43,470
He shamelessly

587
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:44,590
insisted on being my friend.

588
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,310
I had no choice but to give in.

589
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:47,630
I don't believe that.

590
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:49,750
Having no choice but to give in

591
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,710
is actually true.

592
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:52,310
This guy

593
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:53,630
is reckless when he goes crazy.

594
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:55,630
But after all, I was in the wrong first.

595
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:57,150
I destroyed his cave dwelling,

596
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:59,020
so it wouldn't be right to go all out against him.

597
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:00,750
So you apologized to him?

598
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:03,440
It was a strategic compromise.

599
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:05,550
What happened after that?

600
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:06,550
After that...

601
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:09,030
After that, something happened

602
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:09,990
in the clan.

603
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:12,430
My Divine Hand power was sealed.

604
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:14,030
Kai Shan and the others

605
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,710
were also sealed in different places.

606
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:17,550
This Baitou Mountain

607
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,110
is where Kai Shan is sealed.

608
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:20,430
After that,

609
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:23,310
Mei Shan helped me guard this place.

610
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:29,310
Does it hurt?

611
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:30,980
A little bit.

612
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:33,980
Bear with it. It helps with recovery.

613
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:00,960
Why are you looking at me?

614
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:03,190
It's nothing.

615
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:04,820
Am I not massaging well?

616
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,110
It's fine.

617
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,070
Just feels a bit tingly.

618
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:18,180
That means it's almost healed.

619
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:21,540
That's enough for today.

620
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,350
You should rest now.

621
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,710
Please.

622
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,950
Esteemed guest,

623
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:49,630
are you satisfied with this fish?

624
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:51,110
Thank you, waiter.

625
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:52,190
You're welcome, you're welcome.

626
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:53,500
Enjoy your meal.

627
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:56,670
This is bream from the Min River.

628
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:58,150
The taste is exquisite.

629
00:31:58,470 --> 00:31:59,710
If we hadn't passed by here,

630
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,230
we wouldn't have had such a delicacy.

631
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:03,950
We're just passing acquaintances, Sir.

632
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:06,150
I don't know why

633
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:07,200
you've invited me here.

634
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:09,390
We're not just passing acquaintances.

635
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,230
Although it's a bit late,

636
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:12,630
I still remembered you.

637
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:25,830
This is liquor from the Min River.

638
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:26,950
Though not a fine wine,

639
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,790
it has its own unique flavor.

640
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:32,510
Please.

641
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:44,590
How does it taste?

642
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:52,350
When did you remember me?

643
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:54,990
You felt familiar when I first saw you.

644
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:56,710
After thinking carefully,

645
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:58,260
I remembered.

646
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,920
Do you have something to tell me?

647
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:05,040
This sword is quite special.

648
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,340
The blade is a bit shorter.

649
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:07,890
The hilt is also thinner.

650
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,410
May I take a look?

651
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,550
The hilt fits well in my hand.

652
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:35,830
The blade is sharp enough too.

653
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:37,600
It's a good sword.

654
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,090
Does this sword have a name?

655
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,350
You don't recognize it?

656
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:44,470
Should I recognize it?

657
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:45,920
Then why

658
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,350
did you say you recognized me?

659
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:50,670
You're a handmaiden from Xiaoxiang Peak.

660
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:52,230
When I was confined by the Elders

661
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:53,470
in Jinxia Palace,

662
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,130
you came to clean the room.

663
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,590
What? Did I remember wrong?

664
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:07,920
No.

665
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:09,989
You remembered correctly, Sir.

666
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:12,270
I was indeed a handmaiden from Xiaoxiang Peak.

667
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:14,159
We've met a few times.

668
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,270
My status is humble.

669
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,800
I'm flattered that you remember.

670
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:19,340
Don't worry.

671
00:34:19,949 --> 00:34:20,870
Over these decades,

672
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:22,670
it's not unheard of for human handmaidens

673
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:24,030
to quietly slip away.

674
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:25,429
I've come down the mountain this time

675
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:26,670
for other important matters to attend to.

676
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:27,840
I won't give you any trouble.

677
00:34:29,929 --> 00:34:31,050
You're so generous.

678
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:33,139
Thank you so much, Sir.

679
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:34,880
Judging by your physique,

680
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:36,590
you must be trained in martial arts.

681
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:39,030
Did you learn it before coming to the mountain?

682
00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:44,030
As a human, my status is lowly.

683
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:45,530
Would anyone

684
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:47,090
from Fangwai Mountain teach me martial arts there?

685
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:49,750
Perhaps you think

686
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:51,010
I learned it secretly?

687
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:53,360
You seem to dislike me.

688
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,540
I wouldn't dare.

689
00:34:56,909 --> 00:34:58,070
I'm just curious.

690
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,310
Since you're trained in martial arts,

691
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:02,550
why did you go to the mountain as a handmaiden?

692
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:08,910
If you don't want to,

693
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:10,070
you don't have to tell me.

694
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:11,870
I'm just curious, that's all.

695
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:15,350
I was looking for an answer.

696
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:17,390
An answer?

697
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:19,550
When I was young,

698
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:21,390
I accidentally entered a spiritual mountain.

699
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:24,020
All traces of life had vanished on the mountain.

700
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,230
There was only the light of snow everywhere,

701
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:27,830
as if blessed by the gods.

702
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:29,870
I...

703
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:33,350
I encountered a deer.

704
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,420
It stood majestically

705
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:36,770
in the wind and snow.

706
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:38,730
I looked into its eyes

707
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:40,740
and felt

708
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,500
an unprecedented stirring in my heart.

709
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:45,190
It was as if it were

710
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:46,990
the only color in the world.

711
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,100
I thought at the time

712
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,990
that all things have spirits

713
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:53,230
and our meeting was no coincidence.

714
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:54,910
For many years after that,

715
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:57,550
I searched for this deer.

716
00:35:58,350 --> 00:35:59,190
I heard

717
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:01,390
it was a divine deer from the spiritual mountain.

718
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:03,040
It was extremely rare.

719
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:04,380
Perhaps...

720
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:11,870
Perhaps something belonging to the divine race

721
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:13,070
might be on Fangwai Mountain.

722
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,390
I went up the mountain to serve as a handmaiden

723
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:18,060
and searched for it for many years.

724
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:19,870
Did you find it?

725
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:24,190
Later, I did indeed see it again.

726
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,300
Isn't that good?

727
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,580
It's both good and not so good, I suppose.

728
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:33,390
Its appearance hadn't changed,

729
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,440
but it was completely different

730
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:37,540
from the clear and transparent,

731
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:38,830
ethereal,

732
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,220
almost otherworldly feeling

733
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:42,420
I remembered.

734
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,710
So you were disappointed?

735
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:47,310
I wouldn't say disappointed.

736
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:58,830
So many years have passed.

737
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:01,310
I can barely remember

738
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:03,070
what it originally looked like.

739
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:05,260
It was nothing more than

740
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,550
an illusion

741
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:07,870
that I had beautified

742
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:08,950
many times in my mind.

743
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:10,790
To judge the present version

744
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:12,150
against an imagined one

745
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:13,710
isn't fair to him.

746
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:16,190
Perhaps the one I met

747
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:17,280
back then

748
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:19,230
wasn't his true self to begin with,

749
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:20,950
but rather who I thought he was.

750
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:22,590
Moreover,

751
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:26,870
he had long forgotten about me.

752
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:29,350
You seem to have deep insights.

753
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:31,950
Not exactly.

754
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:35,190
I've been trapped in my obsession for too many years.

755
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:37,060
It's time to let go.

756
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:39,720
How old are you?

757
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,150
You're too young to talk about "too many years."

758
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:44,070
But that's good.

759
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:46,740
Wasting your life for a deer

760
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:48,510
is truly unwise.

761
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:51,430
You're right to admonish me, Sir.

762
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:00,160
This sword seems destined for you, Sir.

763
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:03,170
Please accept it as a gift.

764
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:06,700
♫I gaze into your deep eyes♫

765
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:05,340
What do you mean?

766
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,380
♫For whom do you take apart the word "love"?♫

767
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:10,180
Consider it a thank you for the wine you offered.

768
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:17,420
♫Turning around, it's like a dream♫

769
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,380
♫I have betrayed deep love♫

770
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:27,880
♫Unable to get what I yearn for, I sink in sadness♫

771
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:33,650
♫When I brush past love fate is set♫

772
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:37,010
♫I've used up my brush and ink♫

773
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,330
♫But I can't describe♫

774
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:45,060
♫This lovesick path♫

775
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:58,810
Kai Shan is right here.

776
00:38:59,140 --> 00:38:59,990
So you're saying

777
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,030
he sealed himself

778
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:02,680
in the hot spring?

779
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:04,590
He found a good place, right?

780
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:07,810
According to what the Divine Hand has detected,

781
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:09,030
he's in an even deeper place

782
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:10,030
below the hot spring.

783
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:11,950
It's surrounded by scorching energy.

784
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:14,580
What should we do? Let's fish him out.

785
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,870
Kai Shan, return.

786
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,630
Yuanzhong, up there.

787
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,910
Tell me about the restrictions on this mountain

788
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:49,290
and its original owner.

789
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,030
Well, you're asking the wrong person.

790
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:53,310
It's my first time seeing

791
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:54,230
the full extent of the restrictions.

792
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:55,020
As for this place

793
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,630
and its former owner,

794
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:58,230
I've never even met him.

795
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:01,630
That's not right.

796
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:03,270
This person set up

797
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:04,670
such extensive restrictions.

798
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:06,790
He couldn't have done it overnight.

799
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:08,870
Surely their intention

800
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:10,790
was to maintain the mountain's appearance

801
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:12,390
and prevent others from damaging

802
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:13,760
even a blade of grass and leaf on this mountain.

803
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:15,190
How could he allow you

804
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:16,550
to leisurely undergo your tribulations here?

805
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:20,030
Well, if you put it that way,

806
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,760
there is indeed something strange.

807
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:23,710
When I first arrived here,

808
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:24,540
there was always this old fellow

809
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:25,390
who came to give me trouble

810
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:26,390
and tried to drive me away.

811
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:27,390
And then?

812
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:28,750
Then I fought with him

813
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:29,430
for several years.

814
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:30,430
When he saw he couldn't do anything about me,

815
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:31,590
he never came back.

816
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:35,350
Divine artifacts have spirits.

817
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,710
They wouldn't choose

818
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:37,990
to seal themselves here without reason.

819
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,950
Could it be because

820
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:41,110
this place has restrictions

821
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,020
that it's

822
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:43,150
the safest for him?

823
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:45,460
But the problem is it's too safe.

824
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:47,140
Even I can't do anything about it.

825
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:50,670
Don't tell me

826
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:52,230
that you, the mighty host of the Divine Hand,

827
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:52,910
can't break

828
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:54,110
the restrictions here.

829
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:58,060
You really can't break them?

830
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:00,630
Forget about breaking the restrictions.

831
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:02,390
I just tried to deduce it,

832
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:03,630
but I couldn't even determine

833
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:04,700
the direction of the formation's eye.

834
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:08,000
What should we do then?

835
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:20,510
Take care, Sir. Please come again.

836
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:25,030
The Juque Sword?

837
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:28,470
What did you say?

838
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,440
This is the Juque Sword?

839
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:33,830
Sir, you don't

840
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,100
recognize this sword?

841
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:37,070
It is said that this sword

842
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:38,500
was the fifth sword

843
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,470
forged by Ouye Zi.

844
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:40,710
On the day it was completed,

845
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:42,590
its aura pierced the sky, emitting a brilliant light.

846
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:44,760
Today, I've truly seen something great.

847
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:46,620
Are you sure this is the Juque Sword?

848
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:48,710
I specifically searched for this sword in the past.

849
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:49,750
The Juque Sword in the sword diagram

850
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:50,990
doesn't look like this.

851
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:52,070
You said it yourself.

852
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:53,070
It's just a diagram.

853
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:54,190
After so many years,

854
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,270
people have passed on inaccurate information,

855
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:56,470
drawing based on imagination.

856
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:58,110
It can't be very accurate.

857
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:00,140
Now, you have obtained the precious sword,

858
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,810
yet you fail to recognize it.

859
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,640
This is truly...

860
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:10,580
I came out this time

861
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:12,260
just to find it.

862
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:13,830
Since you want to find it,

863
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:15,430
I will surely find it for you.

864
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:18,680
Innkeeper,

865
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:19,590
where is the young lady

866
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:20,550
who dined with me yesterday?

867
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:22,110
That young lady

868
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:23,750
checked out and left early this morning.

869
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:24,870
She left?

870
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:26,460
Do you know where she went?

871
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,600
I have no idea about that.

872
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:34,290
Are all these for me?

873
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:36,060
Yes, they're all for you.

874
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:39,880
They look quite nice.

875
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:41,200
They're not just nice-looking.

876
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:42,470
If you wind it up,

877
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:43,510
it can even move.

878
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:44,330
Give it a try.

879
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:54,150
Can I ask you a favor?

880
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:54,910
Go ahead.

881
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:56,070
Can you go down the mountain

882
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:57,350
and buy a roast goose for me?

883
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,240
No problem. Just wait here.

884
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:01,060
Thanks.

885
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:01,890
No problem.
