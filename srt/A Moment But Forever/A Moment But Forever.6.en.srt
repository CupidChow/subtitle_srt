00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:47,120
[Episode 6]

3
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,310
You're so young, yet your memory is so poor.

4
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,230
Don't you know how to make a wish?

5
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:05,910
Let me make the wish for you then.

6
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,390
Yuanzhong, the High Priest of Fox Clan,

7
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:10,750
in the days to come,

8
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,350
you will be very happy.

9
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:13,230
You will have

10
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,870
new family and friends.

11
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,710
Your life will be lively, ordinary, and carefree.

12
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:20,030
You will live to a ripe old age,

13
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,030
and just like all ordinary people,

14
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,790
be surrounded by your descendants.

15
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:25,230
You'll live out your life

16
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,400
in a warm bed.

17
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,110
This is my blessing for you.

18
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,550
It will surely come true.

19
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:52,329
♫Falling into the mortal world♫

20
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,560
♫Wandering through the clouds and rivers♫

21
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:58,750
♫Being by your side is like finding the shore♫

22
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:00,970
♫If between oaths♫

23
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,200
♫I hold onto the longing for just one more glance♫

24
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:06,850
♫Unwilling to bid farewell for good♫

25
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,590
♫Tears fill a cup♫

26
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,820
♫Longing fades in half♫

27
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:16,490
♫Like flowers in a mirror, or the moon in the water♫

28
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:23,360
♫A thousand years of long nights, yearning from dawn to dusk♫

29
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,230
What are you doing?

30
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:31,950
I...

31
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,310
I was trying to...

32
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,390
To help you remove the golden hoop.

33
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,270
But it seems this method

34
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,310
isn't particularly effective.

35
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,350
I'll go think of another way right now.

36
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,110
High Priest?

37
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,430
Explain yourself.

38
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:50,350
I...

39
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,230
I've gone mad.

40
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:53,470
Gone mad?

41
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,790
You don't look like it to me.

42
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:57,909
I had a nightmare.

43
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:58,950
What did you dream about?

44
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,670
I dreamed you were poisoned,

45
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,150
and I was trying to cure you.

46
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,080
How bold of you.

47
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,370
You're getting more and more presumptuous.

48
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,030
I know I was wrong.

49
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:08,950
I'll leave right away.

50
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,510
I've long felt something was wrong with you.

51
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,470
There's nothing wrong with me.

52
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,190
Yesterday, you said those things,

53
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,620
and today, you threw yourself at me.

54
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:22,830
What are you trying to do?

55
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,310
I didn't throw myself at you.

56
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,350
Who sent you here?

57
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:26,630
Yandu City?

58
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,070
I really am not...

59
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,230
Let me tell you,

60
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,120
don't set your sights on me.

61
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,710
I have no interest in you.

62
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,590
I don't have interest in you either.

63
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:40,810
Stubborn.

64
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:46,070
High Priest,

65
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:46,970
the Elders request your presence.

66
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:54,240
These years I've been busy with cultivation,

67
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,420
[Hall of Elders]

68
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,030
and I'm not familiar with

69
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,030
the clan's affairs.

70
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,390
I don't know why

71
00:05:58,590 --> 00:05:59,990
you've called me here.

72
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:01,830
Here's the thing.

73
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:03,950
You're aware of the incident

74
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,160
with Tanghua today.

75
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:07,170
We suspect it was the work of the War Demons.

76
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,550
If it's true,

77
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,070
then our clan is in danger.

78
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,390
So the Elders propose

79
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,190
to remove your golden hoop,

80
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:16,550
so we can face the War Demons' attack together.

81
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,110
What do you think, High Priest?

82
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:20,820
Remove the golden hoop?

83
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:21,860
Yes.

84
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,230
How can that do?

85
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:25,150
To achieve godhood,

86
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,940
I've enlightened myself on Tianqu Peak for 40 years

87
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,270
and cultivated in Liujiao Palace for another 20.

88
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:30,630
Now I'm just one step away

89
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:31,790
from becoming a god.

90
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,150
How can I give up halfway?

91
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,550
But the War Demons are

92
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:35,909
about to attack now.

93
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:38,120
Other than you, no one in our clan

94
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,710
can resist the War Demons.

95
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:41,800
Rest assured, Lord Wenying.

96
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:44,110
As long as I can attain godhood,

97
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,060
everyone in our clan

98
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,790
can follow my example to cultivate.

99
00:06:46,909 --> 00:06:49,070
Then we can all ascend to the Divine Realm together.

100
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,110
Those War Demons

101
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,620
will no longer be a threat to us.

102
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:52,870
I'm afraid that before

103
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,500
you attain godhood,

104
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,030
we will all be annihilated

105
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:57,390
by the War Demons.

106
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,909
High Priest, listen to me.

107
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,100
You can cultivate anytime,

108
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,190
but if the War Demons really attack,

109
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:06,190
all will be lost.

110
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,580
Lord Wenying is right.

111
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:09,150
Temporarily giving up

112
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:10,710
can also be seen as a form of cultivation.

113
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:12,350
You are too insistent on

114
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,430
attaining godhood.

115
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,830
It's also a kind of obsession.

116
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,150
We all have your best interests at heart.

117
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,990
Please don't harm yourself with the wrong choice.

118
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,390
Is that so?

119
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:24,970
Yes, indeed.

120
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:28,630
Elder Dingxu,

121
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:29,910
do you also think this way?

122
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,430
All the Elders

123
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:35,890
have made valid points.

124
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:40,390
Very well then.

125
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:42,700
I'll do as you say.

126
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:45,390
Then, Dingxu,

127
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:46,950
undo the seal

128
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,110
for the High Priest now.

129
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:51,310
I still need to make some preparations.

130
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,000
I'll remove the seal in three days.

131
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:55,380
What do you think, High Priest?

132
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,320
Let's make it five days later.

133
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,130
Why?

134
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,710
Five days later will be April 6th,

135
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,430
a day when all wishes come true,

136
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,910
all endeavors succeed,

137
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,470
the old is discarded and the new welcomed,

138
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,510
and nothing is taboo.

139
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,910
It's an auspicious day.

140
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:15,470
Alright,

141
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,820
five days later it is.

142
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,260
My son is sick.

143
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:43,020
I'm here to get food for him.

144
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,670
No, he must come himself.

145
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:45,870
For the two of us,

146
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:46,470
this amount is not enough to eat.

147
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:47,440
Stop dawdling and get going.

148
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:54,560
[War Demon Clan, Qian Lin]

149
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,030
Stop right there!

150
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,870
Don't run! Don't run!

151
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:09,950
Stop fighting!

152
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:12,390
Everyone, please stop fighting!

153
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,350
Stop fighting! Stop it!

154
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,670
Let me go!

00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:28,780
[War Demon Clan, Ming Zhang]

156
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,170
Let me go!

157
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:36,770
General,

158
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,310
this kid snuck in under the cover of night.

159
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:38,790
[Tongshan]

160
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:39,150
He's got some nerve.

161
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:41,150
Do you know that

162
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:43,270
changing towns without permission is strictly forbidden?

163
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,030
Let go of me!

164
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,150
You've got quite a mouth on you.

165
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:46,910
You came from Tongshan?

166
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:49,290
It's a thousand miles from Tongshan to here.

167
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:50,900
You've got some skills.

168
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:52,470
Tongshan is nothing.

169
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:53,810
I've been everywhere.

170
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:57,830
That's quite a boast.

171
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:13,430
Are all these yours?

172
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,390
You bastard!

173
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:20,550
I ask, you answer.

174
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,100
What's your name?

175
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:24,860
Speak.

176
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:28,950
Qian Lin.

177
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:31,310
Qian Lin.

178
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,310
Tell me.

179
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,150
Where did these come from?

180
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:36,430
Why are you asking?

181
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,710
You're quite tough, aren't you?

182
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,150
Since we're of the same clan,

183
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:43,670
you should know the rules, right?

184
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:46,750
All hidden towns of the War Demon Clan are classified.

185
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,120
To prevent outsiders from knowing,

186
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,790
unless there's a personal written order from each settlement's leader,

187
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:51,630
no one

188
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,110
is allowed to enter or leave without permission.

189
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,620
You've been to all five settlements.

190
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:07,990
You've got some nerve.

191
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:09,590
What are you looking for?

192
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:12,430
I got bored staying in one place.

193
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:13,710
I'm just wandering around.

194
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:16,500
Do you think I believe that?

195
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,710
Believe it or not, it's up to you.

196
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,180
The world is our clan's enemy.

197
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:45,190
Where we hide

198
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:46,630
is our biggest secret.

199
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:47,660
Do you know

200
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,110
what you've done today can be considered

201
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,750
either a major or minor offense?

202
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:52,230
I can let you go,

203
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,670
or I can have you killed with just one word.

204
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:57,390
No matter what you want to do,

205
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:00,820
if you lose your life,

206
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,510
you won't be able to do anything.

207
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,440
The settlements are scattered far and wide.

208
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,470
Even the clan's administrators

209
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,100
may not know their exact locations.

210
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,390
You've managed to visit all five places on your own.

211
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,030
That makes you quite talented.

212
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:20,440
I value talent.

213
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:23,870
I want to keep you in Gushan

214
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,000
to join us and receive training.

215
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,390
If you accept,

216
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:27,790
I can pretend

217
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,120
that nothing happened today.

218
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,350
Really?

219
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,670
Dingxu must have noticed.

220
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,550
He's not a fool.

221
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:39,790
Proceed as planned.

222
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:40,430
Yes.

223
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:56,260
Open the door.

224
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:58,700
I'm already sleeping.

225
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,420
Whatever it is, let's talk tomorrow.

226
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,030
Open the door.

227
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:07,110
I told you I'm already sleeping.

228
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,670
I've already taken off my clothes.

229
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,390
If you don't open the door,

230
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,740
I'll break it down.

231
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:13,780
This door is made of oak.

232
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:14,630
It's very sturdy.

233
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:16,070
You can't break it down.

234
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:17,340
Zi Fei, break it down.

235
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,710
Ji Tanyin, I'm going to break it down.

236
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,260
Wait, wait!

237
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:26,750
Didn't you say you'd taken off your clothes?

238
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:29,810
I... I put them back on.

239
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,240
You dressed quite quickly.

240
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:37,750
Get out.

241
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:38,750
I...

242
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:44,430
What are you doing?

243
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,190
What can I do?

244
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,740
Of course, I'm going to do

245
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,590
what hasn't been finished yet.

246
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:52,710
I-I...

247
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,190
I really didn't mean anything else.

248
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,910
I just wanted to see

249
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:57,630
if I could remove your golden hoop.

250
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:01,970
You think you can remove my golden hoop by seducing me?

251
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:03,230
I...

252
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:05,380
Did the human race send you to seduce me?

253
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,070
Their plan this time

254
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:08,020
is quite unique.

255
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,950
They sent someone like you.

256
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:12,390
I told you I'm not trying to seduce you.

257
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,390
It's not what you think.

258
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,350
Why would I like you?

259
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:24,950
How could I possibly like you?

260
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:26,390
You're young

261
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,270
and not very bright.

262
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,670
You've been fooled so badly.

263
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:29,390
What's there about you

264
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,190
that's worth liking?

265
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:30,830
You...

266
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,090
New trick.

267
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:38,790
Playing hard to get.

268
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,600
Aren't you afraid of angering me?

269
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:43,470
Get out, get out, get out!

270
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:44,430
I can't explain it to you clearly.

271
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:46,270
Go, go, go! Get out!

272
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:47,030
I...

273
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:51,630
Ji Tanyin,

274
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,270
have you lost your mind?

275
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:54,950
As a handmaiden,

276
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:56,120
how dare you!

277
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,860
Don't test me or I'll set

278
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,670
your house on fire?

279
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:00,870
Calm down.

280
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,550
If you want, I'll go get some firewood.

281
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:04,670
Move aside!

282
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:38,510
Why did you

283
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,800
agree to lift Yuanzhong's seal?

284
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,150
All these years, except for me,

285
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:46,470
you've had the most contact with him.

286
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:48,550
Is he really

287
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,470
as he appears to be?

288
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:53,070
You should know best.

289
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,270
Don't move.

290
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,190
Does it hurt?

291
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:02,190
If this hurts,

292
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:03,910
then what about him?

293
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,350
For 20 years,

294
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:07,350
he had the spirit refinement every 10 days.

295
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,930
How painful must that be?

296
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:10,830
I don't know the truth

297
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,020
about the possession.

298
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,310
I've been taking care of the High Priest for 20 years.

299
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:15,750
I can't tell

300
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,270
what he's really thinking,

301
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:21,260
just as I can't see through you.

302
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:28,430
After all these years,

303
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:29,830
you've confined him,

304
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:30,960
tortured him,

305
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,110
sealed him.

306
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,830
Is it really for the benefit of our clan,

307
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:37,310
or for your own selfish reasons?

308
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:40,310
I don't know that either.

309
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:41,550
I can only follow

310
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,910
my own heart now.

311
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:45,900
Dingxu,

312
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:48,590
we were wrong back then.

313
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:50,350
We hurt him

314
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:51,830
and then we feared him,

315
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,870
so we deceived him.

316
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,490
It's been 60 years.

317
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,580
That's enough.

318
00:16:58,090 --> 00:16:59,090
Have you considered

319
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,530
that if he already knows the truth,

320
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,710
then everything he's shown

321
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:07,390
could all be fake?

322
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:08,750
All of this

323
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:10,569
might be his plan.

324
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:12,790
If that's the case

325
00:17:13,869 --> 00:17:15,710
and we rashly lift the seal,

326
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,310
what will we face?

327
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:19,069
I'm not sure about that,

328
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,950
but I know

329
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,140
this is what we deserve.

330
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:24,810
It's our retribution.

331
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:28,420
Grand Elder, you should rest well.

332
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:30,900
You're already 480 years old,

333
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,700
nearing the limit of our clan's lifespan.

334
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:35,870
Your medical skills are excellent

335
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,750
and you can create life-extending elixirs,

336
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:39,300
but what belongs to others

337
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:41,170
ultimately doesn't belong to you.

338
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,100
Zi Fei.

339
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,110
Yuanzhong, you're awake.

340
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:24,420
What's all this?

341
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:25,980
Ji Tanyin made all of this.

342
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:27,450
All of it?

343
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,470
She made all these in one night.

344
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:30,150
Impressive, isn't it?

345
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,510
I can't move them as fast as she makes them.

346
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,870
Why did she make so many tables and chairs?

347
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:34,260
I don't know either.

348
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:36,230
She also made me a wheelchair.

349
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,890
You know, the kind with wheels underneath.

350
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:39,930
I just push with my legs and it moves.

351
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:41,030
She made one for you too.

352
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:41,880
It's in the storeroom.

353
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,760
Let me bring it for you.

354
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,150
Ji Tanyin.

355
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,450
What are you doing?

356
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:57,190
Working.

357
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,350
Who told you to do this?

358
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,950
I'm thinking about things.

359
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:01,270
When I'm thinking,

360
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,680
I have to keep my hands busy.

361
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:04,220
What are you thinking about?

362
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:06,950
I'm talking to you.

363
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:08,780
You're so annoying.

364
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:09,630
Are men

365
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:10,870
all this talkative?

366
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:11,550
Or is it that

367
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,750
only men from the Youhu Clan

368
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:13,630
are like this?

369
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:15,470
I'm talkative?

370
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:19,820
Fine.

371
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,630
Since it's come to this,

372
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:23,030
let's make it clear.

373
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,260
Earlier, I made three rules with you,

374
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,470
but I only mentioned the first two.

375
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:26,310
Now I'm going to tell you

376
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,150
the third one.

377
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,640
Who wants to hear your third rule?

378
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:29,960
The third rule is

379
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,710
absolutely, absolutely

380
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:32,110
do not develop feelings for me.

381
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:37,000
Our relationship is just that of the High Priest

382
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,710
and his handmaiden.

383
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:38,550
There will be nothing else,

384
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:39,430
understand?

385
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,500
Ji Tanyin, are you alright?

386
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:42,590
Do you want to

387
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:43,580
write down what you just said

388
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:43,910
and see for yourself

389
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:45,070
what you're saying?

390
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:47,390
I don't have experience.

391
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:49,350
My actions last night were indeed inappropriate.

392
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,300
I apologize to you.

393
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,430
It won't happen again.

394
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:52,190
However,

395
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,340
between us,

396
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:55,950
we need to maintain distance.

397
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:57,670
Once this golden hoop is removed,

398
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:58,870
you'll be free again.

399
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:00,750
Then, whoever you want to be with,

400
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:01,430
wherever you want to go,

401
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:02,230
and whatever you want to do

402
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:02,790
is all up to you.

403
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,110
I absolutely won't interfere.

404
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:05,750
You can just treat me as...

405
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:10,670
Treat me as...

406
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:14,590
Yes,

407
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:15,400
just treat me as

408
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,670
a god's image hanging on the wall.

409
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:17,630
I can always bless you

410
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:18,750
and bring you good luck.

411
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,470
I'll accompany you well

412
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,670
until you die.

413
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:22,390
Don't worry.

414
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:23,470
I don't need that.

415
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:24,360
Zi Fei.

416
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:26,950
I'm here. What's wrong?

417
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,310
Drive her out!

418
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:29,870
Where to?

419
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,590
Down the mountain, out of Liujiao Palace.

420
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:32,970
Don't let her appear in front of me!

421
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:34,030
I...

422
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,780
And all these stupid things...

423
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:37,710
Throw them all away!

424
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,480
Y-You're really something.

425
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:44,540
What?

426
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:45,940
You're going to anger him to death.

427
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:46,510
He hasn't been

428
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:48,060
this angry for many years.

429
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:50,230
Not even with Elder Dingxu.

430
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:51,910
This...

431
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:54,110
Is this a good thing?

432
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,990
For me, it is.

433
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:58,940
For you, I'm not sure.

434
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:02,110
Let me be clear.

435
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:02,870
I'm not leaving.

436
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:04,340
I want to stay with him

437
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,990
forever, never leaving his side.

438
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:08,190
You go tell him that.

439
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:09,430
Also,

440
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,070
you don't need to remove the golden hoop anymore.

441
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,060
Why?

442
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:14,230
The Council of Elders has decided

443
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:15,430
to undo his seal

444
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:17,390
in four days.

445
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,400
Thank you, thank you.

446
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:26,210
What do you mean you don't know?

447
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:27,510
Aren't you supposed to find out everything?

448
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,030
Well, I can't

449
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,270
know everything, can I?

450
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,390
If you ask me about high officials

451
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:33,590
or instructors of various teams,

452
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:35,310
I might be able to help.

453
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:35,910
But you're asking about

454
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:38,390
an ordinary woman who never leaves her house.

455
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:39,580
I'm afraid I can't help you with that.

456
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:44,020
Come on, let's talk more.

457
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:44,750
I'll help you, I'll help you.

458
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,430
I'll help you, I'll help you.

459
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:45,780
No need.

460
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:46,590
I'll help you.

461
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:47,750
Think about it carefully.

462
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:49,470
Alright,

463
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,990
I'll tell you what I know.

464
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:52,710
The Gushan hidden town

465
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:54,830
is the largest among our clan's towns

466
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,270
with the largest population.

467
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:58,580
Do you know the unchanging rules of our clan?

468
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:01,830
I know.

469
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,380
All adult men and women

470
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:05,070
have their marriages arranged by the clan leader.

471
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:05,950
If they can't produce offspring

472
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:06,910
after two years of marriage,

473
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:08,110
they will be forcibly separated

474
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,430
and remarried to others.

475
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:10,870
After giving birth to one child,

476
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:11,510
if they can't

477
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,910
produce another one within three years,

478
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:14,110
they will also be separated.

479
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:17,790
You're right.

480
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:18,990
Although it seems inhumane,

481
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:20,140
after the battle of Pinghu,

482
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,990
our clan was nearly extinct.

483
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:23,070
Our population was scarce,

484
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:24,910
and we were hunted down by the Youhu Clan and human race

485
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,230
together.

486
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:28,390
If it weren't for these iron-fisted rules,

487
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,230
you and I wouldn't be here today.

488
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,710
Over the years,

489
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:33,710
I've seen many cases

490
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:34,830
of couple separations and mothers being separated

491
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:36,310
from their children.

492
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,380
You're not the first one

493
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,510
to come looking for someone.

494
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:40,310
Let's not even talk about whether your mother

495
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,400
is here or not.

496
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,550
Even if you do find your mother,

497
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:44,630
she already has a husband

498
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:45,870
and children.

499
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:47,470
Do you really think she'd be willing to leave with you?

500
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,790
I won't know until I try.

501
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:50,750
My father is old now.

502
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,070
He doesn't have much time left.

503
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:52,790
I need to let him see

504
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:54,110
my mother one last time before he dies.

505
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:57,190
Why don't you try finding Granny Gu?

506
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,100
Who?

507
00:22:58,870 --> 00:22:59,910
Granny Gu.

508
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:02,190
She's a crazy old lady

509
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:04,350
who survived the Battle of Pinghu.

510
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:06,350
Her entire family

511
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,470
was killed by the Youhu Clan.

512
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:10,910
She's most skilled in

513
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:12,830
witchcraft and curses.

514
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:15,310
She can communicate with gods.

515
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:17,230
If she's willing to help you,

516
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:19,340
you might still have a chance.

517
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,390
Granny Gu.

518
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:36,670
The High Priest is wise and powerful.

519
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:38,350
The High Priest has a healthy and long life.

520
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,350
Why aren't you eating?

521
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:06,390
These are freshly picked.

522
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:08,430
I rushed over here in a hurry.

523
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,390
The flavor must still be fresh.

524
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:14,390
Please don't be angry anymore.

525
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:15,990
Let me apologize to you.

526
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:17,790
I was wrong yesterday.

527
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:18,880
But I also ask you

528
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,270
to try to understand me a little.

529
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:22,340
I've never been a handmaiden before.

530
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,550
I've never served anyone.

531
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:25,150
So, many times,

532
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:27,030
I felt that we were equals.

533
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:27,790
I didn't consider myself

534
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:29,230
to be your servant.

535
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:33,270
You make it sound like I forced you

536
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,670
to be my handmaiden.

537
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:35,910
That's not it.

538
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:38,990
Anyway, there are many things

539
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:40,230
I can't tell you.

540
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:41,470
As long as you're not angry with me,

541
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:42,350
that's all that matters.

542
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:46,230
Why would I be angry?

543
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:48,140
You're just a handmaiden.

544
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:49,630
If you're not suitable,

545
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:50,790
I can simply replace you.

546
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,350
Why waste so many words?

547
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:53,790
I'm different from others.

548
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,270
How are you different?

549
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:02,630
I'm skilled and dexterous.

550
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:03,710
Whatever you want,

551
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,350
I can make it all for you.

552
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:06,590
I'm also knowledgeable and talented.

553
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:07,900
I know many things.

554
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,580
If you keep me by your side,

555
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,430
it's like

556
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:11,990
having a mobile library with you.

557
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:13,830
And also...

558
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:16,070
These qualities of yours

559
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:17,870
are worthless to me.

560
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:21,550
Ji Tanyin, you're very strange.

561
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:22,470
Do you know that?

562
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:24,830
Do you know who I am?

563
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:27,270
I am the High Priest of the Youhu Clan,

564
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:28,980
the owner of the Divine Left Hand.

565
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:31,110
I am the person closest to a god in this world.

566
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,940
Everyone approaches me

567
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:36,630
for a purpose.

568
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,990
If they're not trying to kill me,

569
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:41,950
they're trying to use me.

570
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,810
They all want something,

571
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:45,550
but they all pretend

572
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:47,310
to be ordinary,

573
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:49,350
as if they're harmless.

574
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:52,430
But you?

575
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:01,510
You don't seem ordinary at all.

576
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,990
Every word you've said,

577
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:05,580
everything you've done,

578
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,430
has been extremely strange.

579
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,470
It's as if you

580
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:10,750
don't belong in this world.

581
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,150
Yet you don't try to hide

582
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:14,270
this strangeness at all.

583
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:15,860
You just

584
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,390
speak so openly

585
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:19,270
and act so frankly.

586
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:21,190
I can't figure out

587
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:23,030
what you really want to do.

588
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:25,070
Do you know?

589
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:27,760
This is not good.

590
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:28,950
I...

591
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:30,750
I don't want to do anything.

592
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:32,750
I just want to be with you.

593
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,070
What makes you think

594
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,710
you can be with me for a lifetime?

595
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:38,070
You're nothing but

596
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:39,790
a handmaiden.

597
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:41,710
What gives you the right to

598
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:43,670
think you're special?

599
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:45,350
To think I would agree to you?

600
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,750
This confidence and composure of yours...

601
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:51,940
Where did it come from?

602
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:53,980
Yuanzhong.

603
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:56,350
Don't talk like that.

604
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:58,270
You're a good person.

605
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,830
Good people don't talk like that.

606
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:06,440
What makes you think I'm a good person?

607
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,430
I saw it in your heart.

608
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,150
Have one.

609
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:25,950
You love eating this the most.

610
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:28,780
You're so sad inside.

611
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,000
It's all cold and icy.

612
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:31,790
But you still think about it.

613
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:33,510
It's so picky.

614
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:35,550
Picky about soil and water, picky about sunlight,

615
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:36,590
picky about location,

616
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:38,070
yet it can still grow

617
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:38,870
in your heart.

618
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:39,830
Evidently,

619
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,550
your heart isn't that cold.

620
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:42,950
What exactly are you trying to say?

621
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:45,290
Don't be angry anymore.

622
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:46,630
I've already

623
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:48,110
put those chairs away.

624
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,470
I won't steal kisses from you anymore.

625
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,430
I'll take good care of you

626
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:53,790
and be a good handmaiden.

627
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:55,110
Oh, right.

628
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:56,670
Zi Fei has already told me.

629
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:58,590
Your seal will be undone soon.

630
00:27:58,830 --> 00:27:59,910
That's great.

631
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:01,590
You'll be free after that.

632
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:03,030
You can go wherever you want.

633
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,870
You don't know how useful I can be yet.

634
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:07,590
Once you can go out,

635
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:08,510
you'll see.

636
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:10,870
I've been to many places.

637
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,670
I'm really good at finding my way.

638
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,430
I'm skilled, strong,

639
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:15,670
and I can make money too.

640
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:16,830
I can do the work of many

641
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:17,910
by myself.

642
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:19,230
Also,

643
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:21,950
I am the person who believes in you the most.

644
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:24,510
I'm the one who will

645
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:26,730
never betray you.

646
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:32,020
Alright.

647
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:33,390
I'll go cook now.

648
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:34,490
Oh, right.

649
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,150
Zi Fei has already told me.

650
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:36,880
For each of your meals.

651
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,260
you need eight meat and eight vegetable dishes.

652
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:39,550
I've noted it all down.

653
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:41,550
Today we also have Red Oil Cloud Strings.

654
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:43,150
I've practiced it a few times secretly.

655
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:44,470
The taste is not bad.

656
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:45,350
Wait for me, okay?

657
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:19,590
Who are you looking for?

658
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:23,380
Are you looking for Granny Gu?

659
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,070
Yes, does she live here?

660
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:27,310
Yes, this is the right place.

661
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:28,850
However, you should come back another day.

662
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:30,140
The courtyard gate is closed now.

663
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:32,080
It means Granny Gu isn't seeing visitors today.

664
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:03,630
Is anyone there?

665
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,370
Are you Granny Gu?

666
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:24,160
Granny Gu.

667
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:51,230
[War Demon Clan, Granny Gu]

668
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,200
It's not about being early but being timely.

669
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:08,580
We can't afford any mistakes this time.

670
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:10,190
If the information is false,

671
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:12,710
our embarrassment will be the least of our worries.

672
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,190
Rest assured, Grand Elder.

673
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:15,620
I have investigated

674
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,230
the possession thoroughly.

675
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:18,720
We have both testimonial and physical evidence.

676
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:19,980
The evidence is ironclad.

677
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:21,340
They can't overturn it.

678
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:22,390
That's good.

679
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,910
You go prepare first.

680
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:43,310
Grand Elder,

681
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:44,820
today is your birthday.

682
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:45,890
Have a bowl of noodles.

683
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,310
I don't celebrate birthdays.

684
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,500
No outsiders know about it anyway.

685
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,820
It's just for good luck.

686
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:53,970
I wish you blessings as vast as the East Sea,

687
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:55,380
and longevity like the Southern Mountains.

688
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:20,670
The Council of Elders sent a messenger here.

689
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:21,570
They're calling for you.

690
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:27,500
How is it?

691
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,370
Your craftsmanship is quite good.

692
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:31,550
It looks quite similar to that old rascal Dingxu.

693
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:33,700
Does it?

694
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:34,960
Yes, it does.

695
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,190
Greetings, High Priest.

696
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:52,190
Where's Ji Tanyin?

697
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:54,890
I don't know. Should I go call her?

698
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:56,750
Let's go.

699
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:18,390
Isn't it beautiful?

700
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:21,920
It is beautiful.

701
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:23,550
But Hannv,

702
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:24,770
we've been here looking at it

703
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:26,080
for so long now.

704
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:27,310
I should go.

705
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:28,070
You don't have anything

706
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,470
to do in the mortal realm.

707
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:31,340
Why are you in such a hurry to go back?

708
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:32,990
I'm not that free either.

709
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:33,950
Besides,

710
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,390
I don't understand these things.

711
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:37,990
It's right that you don't understand.

712
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:40,590
That's why I asked you to observe it.

713
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:41,670
If you view it

714
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:43,230
with expectations and assumptions,

715
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:44,110
the work loses

716
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:45,270
its original intent.

717
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:46,440
It will be misinterpreted.

718
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,180
Time in the Divine Realm is lonely.

719
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:53,670
It's rare to find someone with a compatible temperament.

720
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:55,590
Tanyin,

721
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,350
in all these years you've been in the mortal realm,

722
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:59,590
I haven't had anyone to talk to.

723
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:01,910
You don't know how much I've missed you.

724
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,200
I don't know why,

725
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:06,530
but I just really like you.

726
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:12,510
When you first became a god,

727
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:14,550
I was your guide.

728
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:17,550
We hit it off right from the start.

729
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,750
Do you remember how I told you

730
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:21,429
I had a younger sister

731
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:22,750
before my ascension?

732
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:25,199
You've mentioned this a few times.

733
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:26,989
Her embroidery skills were also very good.

734
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,400
It's just a pity

735
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,989
she didn't have much patience.

736
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:31,630
She couldn't sit still.

737
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:33,870
She had a lively and outgoing personality.

738
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:36,190
If only she could be like you,

739
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:37,350
dedicating herself to her craft,

740
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:39,070
and ascend with me,

741
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,300
that would have been wonderful.

742
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:45,670
Hannv.

743
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:48,510
At least I've had you all these years.

744
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:50,949
I will always remember

745
00:34:50,949 --> 00:34:52,630
your care for me.

746
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:54,590
You're just so kind.

747
00:34:55,429 --> 00:34:56,750
During the war between gods and demons,

748
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:57,880
the celestial ladder was destroyed.

749
00:34:58,190 --> 00:34:59,550
Taihe lost the Divine Hand

750
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:00,710
and fell into a deep slumber.

751
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,730
Among all the gods in the Divine Realm,

752
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:03,470
who dared to risk

753
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:04,850
the destruction of their divine soul

754
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:06,390
to leap from the Gate of Heaven,

755
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:08,030
cross the Sea of Flux,

756
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:09,660
and search for the Divine Hand in the mortal realm?

757
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,060
Only you.

758
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:13,280
You did it without a word.

759
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:15,110
Only you treated me as a friend.

760
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:18,030
You know I can't let go of Taihe.

761
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:19,830
You were afraid I'd be heartbroken.

762
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,790
It's not entirely like that.

763
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:23,990
When Deity Taihe was around,

764
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:25,280
he was also very good to me.

765
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:26,870
He's the Primordial God,

766
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:28,170
a very important god.

767
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:31,290
And because I have craftsmanship skills,

768
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:33,000
I don't rely entirely on immortal techniques.

769
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,670
My chances of crossing the Sea of Flux

770
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:35,990
is greater.

771
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:37,790
You're always like this,

772
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:39,700
never boasting about your achievements.

773
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:53,790
Is everyone here?

774
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,150
Grand Elder,

775
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:56,190
everyone is present.

776
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:08,710
The Youhu Clan

777
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,790
has propagated since the beginning of primordial chaos

778
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:12,430
for over 10,000 years.

779
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,550
For these 10,000 years,

780
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:15,070
our clan has dwelled deep in the mountains,

781
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:17,320
brewing tea, burning incense, cultivating qi and refining our minds,

782
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,550
staying out of worldly conflicts.

783
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:21,110
However, in the great war between gods and demons, many gods died,

784
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:23,350
and the entire War Demon clan turned to the demonic path,

785
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,710
reigniting the flames of war and harming all living beings.

786
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:27,670
Our clan was fortunate

787
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:28,820
to wield divine artifacts

788
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,470
and save countless people from calamity.

789
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:31,710
In the Battle of Pinghu,

790
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:33,580
the High Priest led our clan

791
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:34,750
and wiped out the War Demons's army

792
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:35,990
of 200,000 soldiers.

793
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,150
Though it was brutal,

794
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:38,230
it brought about

795
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:40,230
60 years of peace and prosperity.

796
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:43,510
Sixty years have passed.

797
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:44,830
Your weapons

798
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:46,950
must be rusty and dusty by now, right?

799
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:54,180
But this is a good thing.

800
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:56,310
Who would want to touch weapons

801
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:58,310
when there are good days to enjoy?

802
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,000
Even the High Priest

803
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:01,470
could seal away his divine artifact

804
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:02,390
to plant flowers, raise fish,

805
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,810
and live in leisure.

806
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:05,590
What's wrong with us

807
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:07,070
being a bit lazy?

808
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:08,350
Unfortunately,

809
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:10,270
the tree desires stillness, but the wind refuses to stop.

810
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:12,030
You all know

811
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,670
what happened recently.

812
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:15,830
The evil possessing technique has been occurring frequently.

813
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:18,110
Even Tanghua couldn't escape it.

814
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:20,550
Generals Xiazhi and Chiyi

815
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:22,230
met with unfortunate and tragic deaths.

816
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:23,270
This possessing technique

817
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:25,180
is a unique secret art of the War Demons.

818
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:26,190
Everyone,

819
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:29,190
the War Demons are about to make a comeback.

820
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:31,180
Are we prepared?

821
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,400
High Priest, what about you?

822
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,670
Are you ready to face

823
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:40,070
the next Battle of Pinghu?

824
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:53,750
I suddenly remembered

825
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:55,830
that I've never raised fish.

826
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,850
Take another look at this one.

827
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:17,510
I embroidered Yaoshan.

828
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:19,270
Remember when we attended

829
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:20,910
the White Crane Immortal's birthday banquet together?

830
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:24,830
Look at this green color

831
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:25,890
and threads.

832
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:27,230
Isn't it beautiful?

833
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:29,590
I used the green lotus from the Jade Pool

834
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:30,630
to color it.

835
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:32,070
Each thread

836
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:34,190
is extracted from the green lotus flowers.

837
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:35,790
Not one flower too many,

838
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:37,020
not one flower too few.

839
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:38,070
That's what created

840
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:39,790
this perfectly natural color.

841
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:40,890
Hannv,

842
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:42,630
I have to go.

843
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,140
Go? Why?

844
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:46,670
We haven't finished looking yet.

845
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:47,670
I really have something to do.

846
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:48,870
I can't stay any longer.

847
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:50,230
I've broadened my horizons today

848
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:51,390
and feasted my eyes.

849
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:52,630
I'll see more next time if I have the chance.

850
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:53,390
Farewell.

851
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:55,670
Tanyin.

852
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:59,190
High Priest, you are humorous.

853
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:00,950
No wonder you're so relaxed.

854
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:02,550
After all, you have the divine artifact in hand.

855
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,630
Even if the War Demons rise from the ashes,

856
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:06,620
it'd be a suicide mission.

857
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:08,230
With the High Priest around,

858
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:10,750
no matter what tricks the War Demons have,

859
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:12,210
there's nothing to fear.

860
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,150
Indeed.

861
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:14,430
When the time comes,

862
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:16,350
we'll just cheer from the sidelines

863
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:19,160
and watch the High Priest show his power.

864
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:20,500
That's right.

865
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,480
High Priest,

866
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,270
you are the savior

867
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:28,940
and a meritorious figure of the Youhu Clan.

868
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,550
But in recent years,

869
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:32,330
you haven't been treated well.

870
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:33,550
You haven't received

871
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:35,150
the treatment befitting your merits.

872
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,570
I feel guilty about this.

873
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,710
But now, with a great enemy before us,

874
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:41,670
the mortal realm needs your protection.

875
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:43,150
I hope you can put aside past grievances

876
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,430
and take up

877
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:45,710
your rightful duties,

878
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:47,750
living up to the divine artifact's choice.

879
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,580
Elder Xinyao, why do you say this?

880
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:53,400
These years, I've focused on cultivation

881
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:54,460
without handling politics.

882
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,950
I've consumed vast resources of the clan.

883
00:39:57,310 --> 00:39:58,320
Not only

884
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:00,060
have the Elders not blamed me,

885
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:02,330
but have also helped me greatly.

886
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:04,740
Especially Elder Dingxu,

887
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,350
who expends energy

888
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,430
every few days to help me with spirit refinement.

889
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:10,830
I can't thank him enough.

890
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:13,260
How can I possibly complain?

891
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,100
The High Priest is right.

892
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:17,560
We are all of the same clan.

893
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:19,750
Even if there were any unpleasant matters,

894
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:20,690
haven't they all passed?

895
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:22,360
The High Priest is generous

896
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:23,950
and won't dwell on such things.

897
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:26,340
Xinyao, rest assured.

898
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:31,950
Since this is the general consensus

899
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:34,230
and the High Priest is generous,

900
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:35,840
let's get to the main point.

901
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:37,910
Elder Dingxu,

902
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:40,130
I remember you used the Heaven-Turning Seal

903
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:41,950
to collect the magical powers of all the Elders

904
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:43,660
and infused the golden hoop

905
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:45,350
with crucial restrictions.

906
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:47,990
Now, to undo the seal,

907
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:49,030
we need it again.

908
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,360
May I ask where this seal is?

909
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:54,710
Elder Dingxu.

910
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:07,820
Wait.

911
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:16,790
Hannv, why do you

912
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:18,150
insist on keeping me here?

913
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:19,990
Has something happened down there

914
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,410
that makes it inconvenient for me to return?

915
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:22,590
I am not one of the Thunder Division's gods.

916
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:23,840
I don't have time to argue with you.

917
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:25,510
I only know that Deity Taihe

918
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:26,630
is the master of heaven and earth,

919
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:27,430
the one who governs

920
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:28,510
the order and laws of all things.

921
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:29,310
His existence

922
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:31,270
is more important than anyone or anything else.

923
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:32,390
You can't be reckless about this.

924
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:33,580
It's not like that.

925
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:35,190
Hannv,

926
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,430
do you remember

927
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:37,830
the first lesson

928
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:39,580
you taught me as my guide

929
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,040
when I first ascended?

930
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:42,870
You took me to

931
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:44,320
the Divine Palace of the Immortal Emperor.

932
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:45,910
There was a scale of fairness there

933
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:47,870
that could weigh all things in the world.

934
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:49,440
We weighed three pairs of things.

935
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:50,590
They were

936
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:52,310
the patriotic heart of a scholar

937
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:54,540
and the family concerns of common people;

938
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:56,230
100 years of cultivation by the immortal race

939
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:57,860
and the one-day lifespan of a mayfly;

940
00:41:58,190 --> 00:41:59,790
the thousands of miles a devout believer travels

941
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:00,830
after a religious ceremony

942
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:02,470
and the short distance from bedroom to shrine,

943
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:04,110
which takes only half a cup of tea's time.

944
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:04,950
You asked me,

945
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:06,150
"Which is lighter, which is heavier?

946
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:07,030
Which is higher, which is lower?'

947
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:08,150
Which is more valuable, which is less?"

948
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:09,820
The result was the same.

949
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:10,990
They all weighed the same.

950
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:13,190
This is the way of the gods.

951
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:14,850
All beings are equal.

952
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,590
All beings can be equal,

953
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:23,870
but Taihe is different.

954
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:26,470
What's different about him?

955
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:28,950
Isn't he one of all beings?

956
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:30,030
If gods believe that they're not part of

957
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:31,070
"all beings,"

958
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:32,870
then can that still be truly fair?

959
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:34,750
The primordial power chose the gods.

960
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:35,550
If the gods

961
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:37,350
could act as they please,

962
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:38,950
wouldn't the world fall into chaos?

963
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:40,900
Deity Taihe is the Primordial God.

964
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:41,630
His contributions to heaven

965
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:42,910
and the mortal realm are immeasurable.

966
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,710
If all this can be easily abandoned,

967
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:45,830
how can we speak of fairness?

968
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:47,430
Deity Taihe won't die.

969
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:48,910
He hasn't been abandoned.

970
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:50,390
He just needs to wait a while.

971
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,430
He is an ancient god

972
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:53,830
who has lived for hundreds of thousands of years.

973
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:55,390
Even when he takes a nap,

974
00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:56,710
he sleeps for a hundred years.

975
00:42:56,990 --> 00:42:58,430
Can't we allow mortal beings

976
00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:00,190
and Yuanzhong to see more of

977
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:01,270
this world?

978
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,910
No wonder Deity Shangshan

979
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:07,630
wanted to set rules with you.

980
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,400
You've become emotional

981
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:11,440
and lost your rationality.

982
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:12,430
You're the one who has

983
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:13,790
become emotional and irrational,

984
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:14,630
not me.

985
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:17,570
Hannv,

986
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,170
I know you're an incense deity

987
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:20,790
with many eyes and ears in the mortal realm.

988
00:43:20,790 --> 00:43:22,470
You must know what's about to happen.

989
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:24,180
Yuanzhong must be in danger,

990
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:25,710
and that's why you're trying to stop me from going back.

991
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:26,750
But it won't work.

992
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:28,220
You can't stop me.
