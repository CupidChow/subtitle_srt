[Episode 26]

3
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:50,640
I hope he can use this power wisely

4
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,840
and live out his life

5
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,350
under the protection of Goddess Wushuang

6
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,560
without wasting

7
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:58,820
the opportunity we've given him.

8
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,710
Why is the sky suddenly so bright?

9
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,240
Ji Tanyin.

10
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,280
Are you going back?

11
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,710
You might be in danger.

12
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:31,520
I won't.

13
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,150
Do you have to get involved in his affairs?

14
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,850
Excuse me, is Miss Ji here?

15
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,150
That's me.

16
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,950
Someone asked me to deliver this letter to you.

17
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,400
Enjoy.

18
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:59,680
Miss, welcome.

19
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,590
This way.

20
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,240
If you have something so important

21
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,800
that you must tell me,

22
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,150
now is the time to say it.

23
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,630
The noodles here

24
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,960
don't look that great.

25
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,630
How come you and the High Priest of the Youhu Clan

26
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,280
never get tired of eating them?

27
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,079
I have something important to attend to today.

28
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,310
If you have nothing to say,

29
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,400
I'll be going.

30
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,840
You're upset?

31
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:29,710
Could it be...

32
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,150
he's seen through you

33
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,710
and known you're up to no good?

34
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,750
What are you talking about?

35
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:36,360
It can't be. There are plenty of women

36
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,560
skilled in craftsmanship in this world.

37
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,560
Besides me,

38
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,400
who else could have found out

39
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,030
you're Goddess Wushuang?

40
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,910
What are you talking about?

41
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,000
I mean,

42
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,680
sorry, Goddess Wushuang,

43
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:54,680
you've been…

44
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,440
exposed.

45
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:58,710
Don't talk nonsense.

46
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,680
Actually, it's not hard to guess.

47
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,400
If anyone

48
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,520
had paid close attention to you,

49
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:06,180
they'd have noticed you're different.

50
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,630
Look,

51
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:08,880
you're the Youhu Clan's

52
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,280
High Priest's handmaiden

53
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,470
and a friend to the War Demons.

54
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,800
You're kind to humans as well.

55
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,870
Besides, your craftsmanship is remarkable.

56
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:19,310
The Youhu Clan, the War Demons, and the human race

57
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:21,870
have been at odds for over a century,

58
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,480
fighting and spilling blood.

59
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,160
Yet you've managed to deal with them all

60
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,270
and remain neutral.

61
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,630
Isn't that strange?

62
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,510
That's all you have

63
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,870
to determine my identity?

64
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,830
No, no, no.

65
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,310
I don't need all that.

66
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,240
The first time I saw you,

67
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,159
I knew who you were.

68
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:39,430
900 years ago…

69
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,310
you made a lamp.

70
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,600
Do you remember?

71
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,159
You're a weapon spirit?

72
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,000
Yes.

73
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,190
I've been around

74
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,270
for quite a while.

75
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,680
I thought in this lifetime,

76
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:01,800
I'd never have the chance

77
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,070
to see you again.

78
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,070
I didn't expect that lamp

79
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:07,310
to create a weapon spirit.

80
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,310
I thought it had been

81
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:10,270
destroyed in the war between gods and demons.

82
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:11,680
Indeed.

83
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,160
This world

84
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:15,000
is full of unexpected things,

85
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,560
and that's what makes it so fascinating.

86
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,240
Goddess Wushuang,

87
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,120
during those years when I was a lamp,

88
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,240
I kept watching you

89
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,830
and kept wondering

90
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,360
what kind of man

91
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,480
you'd fall for.

92
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,360
Would it be someone like Deity Taihe,

93
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,680
serious and dignified?

94
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,800
Or someone like Mr. Loong, humorous

95
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:34,630
and knowledgeable?

96
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,240
Thinking it over,

97
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,360
I figured it should be a combination of both.

98
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,159
In other words...

99
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,560
it should be someone like me.

100
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,159
But who would have thought

101
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,480
you'd fall for someone

102
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,560
like the High Priest of the Youhu Clan?

103
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,480
You came to kill him and take his hand, right?

104
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,000
Indulging yourself like this,

105
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,390
aren't you afraid

106
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,510
of being caught in a dilemma

107
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,070
and putting yourself in a difficult position?

108
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,360
It's not what you think.

109
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,630
You can't hide it.

110
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
The Divine Left Hand, created by you,

111
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,310
is now on him.

112
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,430
It's obvious why you're here.

113
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,680
I'm just worried about you,

114
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,920
and I feel sorry for him.

115
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:13,680
So tell me,

116
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,000
if one day

117
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,040
he learns who you are

118
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,070
and why you came,

119
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,560
how do you think he'll feel?

120
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,680
He won't find out.

121
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,510
Is this why

122
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,950
you called me here today?

123
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,720
No, no, no.

124
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,560
Goddess Wushuang,

125
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,070
I exist because of you,

126
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,390
so I owe you my life.

127
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,600
There's something

128
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,600
I've kept buried in my heart.

129
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,070
It's a secret of great importance.

130
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,360
If anything goes wrong,

131
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,600
it could lead to the collapse of heaven and earth

132
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:48,270
and the destruction of the Six Realms.

133
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,510
Now,

134
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,680
I want to tell you about it.

135
00:06:58,159 --> 00:07:00,830
During the war between gods and demons, I saw with my own eyes

136
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,040
that Deity Taihe was the Demon God.

137
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:09,200
When I discovered this,

138
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,350
I fled to the mortal realm in a panic.

139
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,600
Since then,

140
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,510
I've never mentioned it to anyone.

141
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,630
I'd never lie to you.

142
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,920
Thank you for telling me this.

143
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,390
Fu Jiuyun.

144
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,070
As a weapon spirit,

145
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,159
you're one in a million

146
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,870
and have lived among mortals for a long time.

147
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,720
In the mortal realm,

148
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,830
through ups and downs,

149
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,070
you've already carved your own path.

150
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,120
I can see that your sea of consciousness

151
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,680
is shrouded in fog.

152
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,720
You've forgotten the most important thing.

153
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:50,159
Your path is not in the Divine Realm,

154
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,750
nor is it with me.

155
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,040
Let me clear the fog for you

156
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,480
so you can see your way forward.

157
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,510
Go now.

158
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:12,440
We'll meet again someday.

159
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,540
[Yandu City]

160
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,910
Why is the sky suddenly so bright?

161
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,600
Is it an omen of natural disasters?

162
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,620
Steamed buns!

163
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,200
Freshly steamed buns!

164
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,000
Thin skin, big filling, piping hot.

165
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,270
Sir, have some buns.

166
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:12,200
Mom, I want some buns.

167
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,940
Now you know it hurts!

168
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:15,910
It hurts.

169
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,480
Do you still know who I am?

170
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,410
You've been out for three days,

171
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,870
gambling day and night.

172
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,000
How much did you lose this time?

173
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,080
I won this time.

174
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,440
Amazing! Amazing!

175
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,550
All talk and no action is fake skill.

176
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,360
All action and no talk is dumb skill.

177
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,720
Talking and doing—that's real skill!

178
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,390
My father and I just arrived here.

179
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,670
We don't know anyone or anything about this place.

180
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,080
We need money to continue our travel.

181
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,480
If you can spare a little change, we'd be grateful.

182
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,270
Sir, we just got

183
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,000
some new calligraphy works and paintings.

184
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,840
Are you interested?

185
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,750
Would you like to take a look?

186
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,120
Would you like to buy calligraphy works or paintings?

187
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,390
No, I can't afford them.

188
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,790
Sir, sir.

189
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,320
Sir, please help me out.

190
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,270
I'm a poor little cripple.

191
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,240
Please show some pity

192
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,510
and give me a copper coin.

193
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,750
Sir, I haven't eaten for a long time.

194
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,270
Please help me out.

195
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,030
You have a death wish?

196
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,120
How dare you hit me!

197
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,870
Sir, this is the place.

198
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,370
Here you are.

199
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:28,650
Have a seat.

200
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:33,200
I thought you wouldn't come.

201
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,960
You're buying me a meal.

202
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,030
How could I not come?

203
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,600
You like peace and quiet,

204
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,750
so I thought you might find this place too noisy.

205
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:41,840
Here, let's drink.

206
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:50,600
This wine

207
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:51,770
is a bit bland.

208
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,000
I don't like it either.

209
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,910
Then why did you order a whole jar of it?

210
00:10:58,670 --> 00:10:59,790
Parting ways with my friend,

211
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,380
I can't help but feel a little down.

212
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,260
You're a really good friend.

213
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,870
Though the wine's not so good,

214
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:07,550
it can still lessen the sorrow a bit.

215
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:08,910
You're leaving?

216
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:10,550
Back to Baitou Mountain.

217
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,000
Didn't you just leave that place?

218
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,480
I did.

219
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,150
Let me tell you,

220
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:15,790
when I was alone

221
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:16,710
back in Baitou Mountain,

222
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,870
I felt so bored.

223
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,600
I heard Yandu City is bustling and prosperous,

224
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,670
so I came to take a look.

225
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,720
But after coming here,

226
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,440
I found it just so-so.

227
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:26,360
Everyone's

228
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,670
obsessed with fame and fortune.

229
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,120
If this is the mortal world,

230
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,550
it's not worth staying for.

231
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,440
Sounds like

232
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,730
you've found your way to enlightenment.

233
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,330
Stop flattering me.

234
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,030
If we're talking about enlightenment,

235
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,270
you had the courage to cut off the Five Sins.

236
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:45,330
I could never manage that.

237
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,080
Yuanzhong,

238
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,120
in a blink of an eye,

239
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:00,440
we've known each other

240
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,720
for 60 years, right?

241
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:04,440
Almost.

242
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,510
How time flies.

243
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:10,870
Do you remember

244
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,200
when we first met?

245
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,440
You smashed my cave dwelling,

246
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,480
and I went to you angrily

247
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,790
to demand an explanation.

248
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:17,910
At that time,

249
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,510
you had just defeated the War Demons

250
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:21,600
and were so powerful with the Divine Left Hand.

251
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,030
You were riding high on success.

252
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,200
Let me tell you,

253
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,270
before I met you,

254
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:27,910
I made

255
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,150
a lot of preparations.

256
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:30,600
I thought there'd be

257
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,270
a fierce battle between us for sure.

258
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:33,440
But unexpectedly,

259
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,270
when we met,

260
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:36,410
you just handed me a chest full of gold.

261
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:38,240
It was a big chest of gold.

262
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,240
You have no idea.

263
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,600
I was completely dumbfounded.

264
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,020
I'd never seen that much gold in my life.

265
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:44,840
As a cultivator

266
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,360
who's about to ascend,

267
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,440
why do you still care so much

268
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,440
about money?

269
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,240
What's wrong with that?

270
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,960
Even immortals have to eat!

271
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:53,810
Someone like you,

272
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,910
who once lived in wealth and luxury,

273
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,070
wouldn't understand.

274
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,750
Actually,

275
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,670
I was injured at that time.

276
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,600
I was worried I couldn't beat you,

277
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:07,270
so I resorted to that trick.

278
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,720
Is... is that so?

279
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,510
At that time, I just thought

280
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,630
the High Priest of the Youhu Clan

281
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:20,890
looked pretty intimidating,

282
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,430
but he was actually reasonable—

283
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,480
someone worth befriending.

284
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,750
So?

285
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,750
So when you asked me later

286
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,030
to watch over Kai Shan,

287
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,200
I agreed.

288
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,550
When I was young,

289
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,150
I was obsessed with martial arts,

290
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,440
devoted to training and cultivation.

291
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,550
When the War Demons and the Youhu Clan

292
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:42,550
went to war,

293
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,750
I was training.

294
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,120
When the war reached humans,

295
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,600
I was still training.

296
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,080
If you hadn't shattered my cave

297
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,390
with one strike,

298
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,270
I probably would've kept training until my tribulation arrived.

299
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,330
That's not wrong.

300
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,030
Not wrong?

301
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,380
It's completely wrong!

302
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,650
I gained all those skills,

303
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,480
yet all I ever thought about was myself.

304
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,150
I went down

305
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:13,840
the wrong path.

306
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,240
Sometimes I even think

307
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,480
that perhaps these endless tribulations

308
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,960
have nothing to do with the broken

309
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,320
celestial ladder.

310
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,510
This is the heavenly way's punishment for me—

311
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,630
punishment for my selfishness

312
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,390
and for turning a blind eye to others.

313
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,390
Sounds like you're hinting at something.

314
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,960
Am I? No, I'm not.

315
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,600
This restaurant has neither famous dishes nor renowned wines,

316
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,360
but on my way here,

317
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:47,000
I caught glimpses of the worldly life.

318
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,120
I guess

319
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,630
this is the real reason

320
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:50,750
you chose this place to say goodbye.

321
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,720
What do you want to tell me?

322
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,030
You know everything, don't you?

323
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,000
Yeah.

324
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,750
Of course,

325
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,030
if I were you

326
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,200
and had gone through all those things,

327
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,630
I'd probably have lost it long ago

328
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,600
and slaughtered my way through this wretched world.

329
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,200
So what right do I have

330
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,240
to talk you out of it?

331
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,140
But, Yuanzhong,

332
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,880
even though I have no right,

333
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,260
there's one thing

334
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,910
I must ask.

335
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,900
Do you really have to do this?

336
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,320
Are there

337
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:31,220
really no other options?

338
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:50,960
I'm leaving.

339
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,720
Let's part ways here.

340
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,240
Mei Shan.

341
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:01,440
Say no more.

342
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,630
I drank too fast.

343
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,590
That's enough wine for today.

344
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,480
While it's still light out,

345
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:07,790
I should get going.

346
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,000
Yuanzhong,

347
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,550
no matter what choice you make,

348
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,260
I'll stand by you.

349
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,150
Without good wine,

350
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,970
we're still good friends.

351
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,480
Qian Lin!

352
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,110
What's wrong?

353
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,350
Tanyin has no breath.

354
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,790
Go get a doctor!

355
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,110
Go!

356
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,000
Stop right there.

357
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:43,070
Hannv.

358
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,820
You don't greet me now

359
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:48,660
and don't see me as your friend anymore.

360
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:50,290
Where are you going?

361
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,760
Why should I tell you?

362
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,550
I haven't even confronted you

363
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:58,590
about ordering the War Demons

364
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,310
to cast the Descent Spell on me.

365
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,680
You'd better

366
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,880
get out of my way.

367
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,440
How arrogant.

368
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:48,370
Yuanzhong.

369
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:54,390
Duanfeng Mountain, the coldest place in the world.

370
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,400
Yuanzhong, it's time.

371
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:58,220
Yuanzhong, I've arrived.

372
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,270
I've arrived too.

373
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:00,590
Wunian Cliff,

374
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:01,940
the extremity of the world.

375
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:03,680
With this cliff as the altar,

376
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:06,510
may all jealousy and evil thoughts be purged.

377
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,590
With the destruction of the source of greed and power,

378
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,440
may the ignorant and greedy souls

379
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:11,750
find salvation soon.

380
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:12,880
Hypocrisy.

381
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:13,690
Obsession.

382
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,570
Cruelty.

383
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,680
Jealousy.

384
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:16,550
Ignorance.

385
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,590
Now, the five of us join forces,

386
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,030
offering our lives as fuel

387
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,550
and burning our souls to cleanse the world's sins.

388
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:23,590
No regrets.

389
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,480
No resentment.

390
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,030
No regrets.

391
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:28,690
No resentment.

392
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,590
Well said.

393
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:33,900
But you miscounted.

394
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,400
It's not five people to be sacrificed.

395
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,190
It's six.

396
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,920
You all stand ready.

397
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,810
I need to settle one last matter.

398
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,680
You're getting

399
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,900
bolder and bolder,

400
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:52,480
not only showing me disrespect

401
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,550
but having no concern for Deity Taihe as well.

402
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,160
Looks like you don't want

403
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:57,350
your divine title anymore.

404
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,720
I can't make you understand.

405
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,400
What are you doing?

406
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,000
You're too selfish.

407
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,330
Just because you like Yuanzhong,

408
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:06,880
you don't care about Taihe

409
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,280
or the Divine Realm anymore.

410
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,550
I won't allow you

411
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:11,000
to act so recklessly.

412
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,550
As for why I need Yuanzhong alive,

413
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:13,240
in the Discipline Hall,

414
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,550
I explained everything clearly,

415
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,200
and I've told you more than once.

416
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:17,890
I won't repeat what I've already said.

417
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,170
I have something important

418
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:20,360
to report to the five divine lords.

419
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,810
It concerns Deity Taihe.

420
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:23,240
Don't get in my way.

421
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,550
Your words might fool

422
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:13,210
the five divine lords in the Discipline Hall,

423
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,090
but not me.

424
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:15,770
Do you dare to swear

425
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:17,000
that all your actions today

426
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,160
have no personal motives?

427
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,440
Do you dare to swear that you have

428
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,750
no feelings for Yuanzhong at all?

429
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:22,430
I don't need to explain myself to you.

430
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,640
You don't need to?

431
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,110
You just don't dare to.

432
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,710
Your Divinity, can you hear me?

433
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,440
Your Divinity,

434
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:50,270
I don't know what kind of god you are,

435
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,360
so I'll just call you that for now.

436
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,400
Years have passed.

437
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,160
It's been a long time

438
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,320
since I last spoke to you.

439
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:01,720
I used to talk to you all the time.

440
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,100
Do you remember?

441
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:10,750
I was young then,

442
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:14,050
and I always seemed to have so much to say.

443
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:15,590
I talked about my dreams,

444
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,360
my life,

445
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,360
and myself.

446
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,720
Later,

447
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:24,720
I went through a lot of things—

448
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:27,840
doubt,

449
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:29,150
♫Time never defeats the fleeting world♫

450
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:29,500
betrayal,

451
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:32,550
♫Stars turn, shining upon the passing traveler♫

452
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:31,350
the loss of my home,

453
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,510
and the deaths of my loved ones.

454
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,360
Gradually…

455
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:37,150
♫The wind rises, flowers fall and bloom again♫

456
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:40,580
♫Awaiting what's lost to be regained♫

457
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:39,240
I just stopped talking.

458
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,850
♫These countless sorrows and joys♫

459
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:44,030
For 60 years in Fangwai Mountain,

460
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:48,870
♫Dusk and dawn, only you make parting hard♫

461
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,200
I kept thinking about one question.

462
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:55,570
♫I'm willing to risk my life for this♫

463
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:50,160
I wondered…

464
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:53,160
was I wrong?

465
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,440
Was I wrong from the very start?

466
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,150
♫Wind chimes beat with my heart♫

467
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,680
Perhaps the Youhu Clan

468
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,200
was never worth saving.

469
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:01,920
♫Harmonizing, can you recognize it?♫

470
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:02,440
This chaotic world

471
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,440
might have had its own destiny,

472
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:06,140
♫Fingertips tracing your outline♫

473
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:06,070
and there was no need for me to intervene

474
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,960
with the power of the Divine Hand.

475
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:09,280
♫I wish to see through you♫

476
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,720
Maybe

477
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:13,270
♫Whether near or far♫

478
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:14,600
this is the ending the Mortal Realm should have.

479
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:18,280
♫We can still gaze upon the same galaxy♫

480
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,400
I kept this half of the jade token

481
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,840
♫Knowing we've never been apart for a moment♫

482
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,720
to seek protection.

483
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:23,200
But as time passed,

484
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,400
my hands became stained with blood.

485
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:28,060
♫If our promise♫

486
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,810
I felt unworthy to speak freely with you,

487
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,370
♫Is to share this land and rivers♫

488
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,310
even less worthy of your protection.

489
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,640
Gradually,

490
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:35,260
♫If fate leads us astray♫

491
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,790
it became

492
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:36,030
a reminder for me—

493
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:39,330
♫Life and death become our bond♫

494
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:37,720
a reminder that

495
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:38,790
there was once a time

496
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:40,640
when my hands were clean.

497
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:42,450
♫Storms heal with time♫

498
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,720
I never expected

499
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,110
that in this final moment,

500
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:47,740
♫Memories will shine in the end♫

501
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:47,030
the only one I could confide in…

502
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:53,130
♫That very first heartbeat, I will remember until the last♫

503
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,640
would be you.

504
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:54,770
Your Divinity,

505
00:24:55,050 --> 00:25:01,670
♫That very first heartbeat, I will remember until the last♫

506
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:57,440
I once saw you.

507
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:00,270
I know you exist.

508
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:02,160
But if gods exist,

509
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:04,240
why have they abandoned the Mortal Realm?

510
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:05,830
If you exist,

511
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:06,880
why won't you

512
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,240
come to see me?

513
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:09,750
Is it because the Mortal Realm

514
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:11,030
isn't worthy of your protection?

515
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:15,240
Or is it because I'm not worthy of your forgiveness?

516
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,670
Oh no.

517
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:00,680
I underestimated you.

518
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,400
Sometimes I even wonder

519
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:06,100
where you came from

520
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,200
and how you managed to give

521
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,680
this half of the jade token to me.

522
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,550
When you gave it out,

523
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,570
you must have had many expectations.

524
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,200
I don't know if you can

525
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,550
see me now,

526
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,270
or if you can hear me.

527
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:21,880
I even…

528
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,750
I even wonder

529
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:28,200
if you're disappointed in me.

530
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:47,650
Your Divinity,

531
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:50,170
can you hear me?

532
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:56,000
Let me go!

533
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,200
Your Divinity,

534
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,210
I really hope you can hear me.

535
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:01,810
People call me a god,

536
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,350
but they've all forgotten

537
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,270
this "god" they speak of

538
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:07,880
is merely relying on

539
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,310
the power of the Divine Hand.

540
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:12,560
Without this hand,

541
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,710
what am I?

542
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,750
The Youhu Clan

543
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:22,110
is seen as an immortal clan by the world,

544
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:25,160
and they really think they're gods.

545
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,550
I'm not that foolish.

546
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,720
Purging the Five Sins

547
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:31,480
and ascending to godhood

548
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:34,160
is a beautiful dream Dingxu wove for me.

549
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:36,990
But it's not my dream.

550
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:39,000
The only dream I ever had

551
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,310
since I was little

552
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,200
was to return home victorious

553
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,720
and have a bowl of hot porridge

554
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,880
brought to me by my parents and sister.

555
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,640
But now,

556
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:54,070
they've been gone for 60 years.

557
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,960
And my dream

558
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,110
has been gone for 60 years too.

559
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:03,880
60 years ago,

560
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:07,000
the world punished me for the Five Sins.

561
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,960
So today,

562
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:11,400
I'll punish the world for the Five Sins.

563
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,370
Look at the Mortal Realm.

564
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:15,680
Wickedness thrives;

565
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,240
evil desires run rampant.

566
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,480
The Five Sins

567
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,590
are nothing but a big lie.

568
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:25,550
I want to see

569
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:27,380
how many people

570
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:29,750
can truly live without sin

571
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,750
in the vast Mortal Realm.

572
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:32,830
No!

573
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:34,400
Don't do that!

574
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:36,440
60 years ago,

575
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:39,170
I became numb to bloodshed.

576
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:41,320
Hundreds of thousands of War Demons

577
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:42,060
died before me

578
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,850
like ants,

579
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:46,790
and I didn't even blink.

580
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:48,110
This time,

581
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:49,790
it's just another number,

582
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:51,920
only bigger than before.

583
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:54,400
I once spared lives,

584
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:57,000
but today, I'll reclaim them

585
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:59,630
and a thousand times more!

586
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,030
Let me go!

587
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:04,310
Gods above,

588
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,060
heavens above,

589
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:07,950
I, Yuanzhong of the Youhu Clan,

590
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,110
offer my divine power

591
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:11,800
and my life as sacrifices

592
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:13,640
to cleanse this world of desires

593
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:16,500
and seek justice

594
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,280
from this false, hypocritical,

595
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:19,960
and self-righteous world!

596
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:23,860
No. Stop!

597
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:25,790
I must go find him.

598
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,720
Find who?

599
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:29,240
Stop struggling.

600
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,550
I don't want to hurt you.

601
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,400
Do you think I'd still believe you?

602
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,270
Do you really want to

603
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:34,510
fight me to the bitter end?

604
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:35,270
Just take the Divine Hand

605
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:36,270
and focus on your craftsmanship.

606
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:37,070
Isn't that a better choice?

607
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:38,640
As a goddess, I have duties—

608
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:40,320
not just to pass down the art of craftsmanship,

609
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,920
but to ensure the good are rewarded

610
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,400
and the wicked pay the price.

611
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:44,960
That's something

612
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,500
you'll never understand!

613
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:00,750
What a pity.

614
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,790
A mortal heart is still just a mortal heart.

615
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:08,200
Even now,

616
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:11,350
I still can't let go.

617
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:13,040
There's someone

618
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,450
I can't get over.

619
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,550
I miss

620
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:20,840
those days I spent with her

621
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,140
in the Mortal Realm.

622
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:24,170
For decades,

623
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,400
she was the only one

624
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:30,840
who nearly swayed my resolve.

625
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,590
She made me hesitate,

626
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:36,740
have doubts,

627
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,090
and even question myself.

628
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,440
But thankfully...

629
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:51,310
Thankfully, everything between her and me

630
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,880
was just my own wishful thinking.

631
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:03,350
Even if I'm gone,

632
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,720
I suppose

633
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:09,270
she wouldn't grieve for too long.

634
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,050
Ji Tanyin, stop!

635
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,010
You won't make it.

636
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,790
You're injured

637
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:19,200
and can't use your divine power in the Mortal Realm.

638
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,310
You won't make it!

639
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:22,070
Yuanzhong, wait for me.

640
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:25,720
No birth and no death.

641
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:29,200
No dwelling and no emptiness.

642
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,910
No law and no absence of law.

643
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,750
No ignorance and no absence of ignorance.

644
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,830
Gods above,

645
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:40,910
today, with the power of the Divine Hand,

646
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:44,110
I sacrifice my life to cleanse the Mortal Realm of sins,

647
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,360
to break the source of all evil,

648
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:52,410
and to eliminate all sinners!

649
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,270
Begin!

650
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:34,430
Is it going to rain heavily?

651
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:37,650
It's not rain.

652
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:39,310
How is it not?

653
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,100
With all this thunder and lightning,

654
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,590
it's definitely going to pour.

655
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,120
Pay for the wine now

656
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,350
so I can get down the mountain

657
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:47,760
before I get soaked like a drowned rat.

658
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,560
How much?

659
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,550
One tael and eight maces.

660
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:52,720
Why is it so expensive?

661
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,070
Eight maces for the wine;

662
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,640
one tael for the trouble of coming up the mountain.

663
00:32:58,750 --> 00:32:59,550
Tomorrow.

664
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,190
I'll pay you tomorrow.

665
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,270
Tomorrow?

666
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,350
You want me to stay here

667
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:05,400
with you all night?

668
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,790
Isn't it

669
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,790
about to pour anyway?

670
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:12,110
Look,

671
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:13,920
the dark clouds are rolling in.

672
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:16,390
Doesn't it look like a divine punishment from heaven?

673
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,510
My friend,

674
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,510
if we're still alive tomorrow…

675
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,320
I'll pay you.

676
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,130
What nonsense are you talking about?

677
00:33:58,550 --> 00:33:59,350
Yuanzhong.

678
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,510
Help!

679
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,070
Somebody help!

680
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,409
Fire! Fire!

681
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:40,590
Why are flames falling from the sky?

682
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:43,800
Mom!

683
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:46,760
Mom.

684
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,920
Mom.

685
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,550
Oh, heavens!

686
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,280
Spare us!

687
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,840
Spare us!

688
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,800
Yuanzhong,

689
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:07,840
ask yourself.

690
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:09,880
After all these years in this world,

691
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:12,280
apart from hypocrisy, betrayal,

692
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,590
indifference, and obsession,

693
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:14,760
have you never seen

694
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,280
even a glimmer of goodness?

695
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:17,920
Is this world truly not worth

696
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,630
a shred of your affection?

697
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,110
Yuanzhong.

698
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,030
I'm your weapon spirit,

699
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:42,710
closely connected to you,

700
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:43,630

701
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,030
No matter what you do,

702
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:47,050
I'll support you.

703
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:49,110
We exist because of you,

704
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,190
and we perish because of you.

705
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:52,570
Therefore,

707
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:55,880

00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,400
In the future,

759
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,630
you'll have gray hair yet still look young.

760
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:04,360
With your children and grandchildren by your side,

761
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:06,360
you'll live a peaceful

762
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:08,230
and happy life.

763
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:12,630
The one you love will love you too.

764
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,880
Many will envy your life.

765
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,150
In the end,

766
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,480
you'll be happy and fulfilled.

767
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:22,630
When you look back,

768
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:24,480
you'll see a life filled with endless happiness.

769
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,520
♫Falling into the mortal world♫

770
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,660
♫Wandering through the clouds and rivers♫

771
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,230
Look!

772
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,320
Two flowers have blossomed in the pond.

773
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:32,540
♫Being by your side is like finding the shore♫

774
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,400
The wind brought them there.

775
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,160
♫The moon falls by the riverbank♫

776
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:34,960
They're not growing in the pond.

777
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:37,340
♫The light finally dims♫

778
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,920
So beautiful.

779
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:41,740
♫How can my heart be at ease?♫

780
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,110
I'm the person who believes in you the most.

781
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:43,970
♫Tears grow cold in a single cup♫

782
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:45,360
I'm the one who will

♫Longing fades in half♫

784
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:47,440
never betray you.

785
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:50,140
♫Like flowers in a mirror, or the moon in the water♫

786
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:51,320
Yuanzhong.

787
00:37:51,120 --> 00:38:00,870
♫The lonely guest can't sleep, destiny can't be undone; speechless♫

788
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:53,800
I'll be by your side,

789
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,440
always and forever.

790
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,630
Never mind.

791
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:29,720
♫I lament the countless ups and downs♫

792
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:36,850
♫The wind of fate disrupts my life♫

793
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,800
Yuanzhong!

♫What's real? What's fake?♫

795
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:51,480
♫Good and evil blur together as I race through the mortal world♫

796
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:56,450
♫Racing forward, scars all over my body♫

00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:59,450

Old Ghost Mei Shan, wake up.

834
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:43,990
I didn't drink that much.

835
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:44,960
Pay up.

836
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,270
Why are you laughing?

837
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:07,020
The sun's up now.

838
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:08,880
You said yourself

839
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,150
if we're still alive today,

840
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:11,190
you'll pay me.

841
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:12,360
Where's the money?

842
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:15,780
Forget about your money.

843
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,170
Do you know you almost

844
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,080
died last night?

845
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,070
Are you serious?

846
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,280
To avoid paying for the wine,

847
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,760
you planned to kill me?

848
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,040
No wonder

849
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:26,620
you keep getting struck by lightning.

850
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,480
You certainly deserve that.

851
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:30,960
My friend, you'd better

852
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,360
mind what you say.

853
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:33,550
Otherwise,

854
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:35,480
I'll go stay at your house next time

855
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,920
and let you know

856
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,710
what it feels like to be struck by lightning.

857
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:41,360
You're beating around the bush to avoid paying.

858
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,150
Immortals have to play fair too!

859
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,760
If you don't pay me today,

860
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,960
you're not going anywhere.

861
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,280
I wasn't planning

862
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,070
to go anywhere anyway.

863
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:49,110
Trying to provoke me, huh?

864
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,740
I'll just stick with you all day.

865
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:55,030
Do as you please.

866
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:56,230
I've got no money.

867
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:57,090
Take my life if you want it.

868
00:42:58,190 --> 00:42:58,960
I've never seen

869
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,480
an immortal as shameless as you!

870
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:01,890
Don't go!

871
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,590
I'm talking to you!

872
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,320
Don't go! You hear me?

873
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:18,120
Yuanzhong.
