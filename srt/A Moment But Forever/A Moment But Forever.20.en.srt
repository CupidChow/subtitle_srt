[A Moment But Forever]

2
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,130
[Episode 20]

3
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:50,120
When Yuanzhong was transferring power to Lu Chen,

4
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,280
the Demon Dragon thought

5
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,310
Yuanzhong would be a better

6
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,310
vessel for possession.

7
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,680
So it transformed into a demonic energy

8
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:56,710
and entered Yuanzhong's

9
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:57,710
sea of consciousness.

10
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,040
I fought against him for days

11
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,070
but was ultimately defeated.

12
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,480
He severely wounded me

13
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:03,870
and entered the cave.

14
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,760
The Demon Dragon entered

15
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,590
Yuanzhong's Cave of Spiritual Consciousness?

16
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,310
Correct.

17
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,910
This cave

18
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,710
is Yuanzhong's realm of consciousness.

19
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,840
It has nine levels in total,

20
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,360
intertwined and reflecting each other,

21
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,470
all of which are crucial.

22
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:17,910
For each level that's eroded,

23
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:18,960
it's as if Yuanzhong

24
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,000
has died a little.

25
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,070
If he enters

26
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,430
the deepest ninth level,

27
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,400
his spiritual consciousness will be erased,

28
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,150
and this body will be possessed by the Demon Dragon.

29
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,430
What should we do then?

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm severely wounded

31
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,400
and can only rely on external help.

32
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:32,750
Since you're an external consciousness,

33
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,360
you can help me drive out the Demon Dragon.

34
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:36,560
I understand.

35
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:37,710
So, which level

36
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,150
has the Demon Dragon reached now?

37
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,240
Based on the time elapsed,

38
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,030
it must be approaching the ninth level.

39
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,260
What are we waiting for then?

40
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:45,210
Let's hurry!

41
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:07,660
Once upon a time, Zhuangzi dreamed he was a butterfly,

42
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:11,740
a very lifelike butterfly.

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,980
He was so happy!

44
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,770
He didn't know he was Zhuangzi.

45
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,360
This is the first level.

46
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,280
It seems to be the Youhu Clan's school

47
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,750
before the great battle.

48
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,000
A butterfly indeed.

49
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,800
Tanghua,

50
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,470
stand up!

51
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,329
You little brat!

52
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,240
Who let you wear boots?

53
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,190
Who let you wear boots?

54
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:36,960
Who let you wear boots?

55
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,430
Why is he hitting him for wearing boots?

56
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:41,010
Isn't everyone wearing boots here?

57
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,000
This is a dream.

58
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:45,000
It's formed by thoughts, without rules or limits.

59
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,400
It's completely different from reality,

60
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:47,400
strange and bizarre.

61
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,670
Naturally, anything is possible.

62
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:52,520
Alright.

63
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,680
So how do we

64
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,910
get to the next level?

65
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,360
The consciousness owner of each level is the entrance.

66
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,000
So we just need to find

67
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,400
the Yuanzhong of this level.

68
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,820
Which one is he?

69
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,110
All the people here

70
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,470
are created by his thoughts.

71
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,910
So from my perspective,

72
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,000
they're all him.

73
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,360
I can't distinguish them.

74
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,520
You can't recognize him?

75
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,230
Correct.

76
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,120
That's why I need you.

77
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,160
Which one do you think is him?

78
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,450
Which one could be him?

79
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,270
Quick, look at me.

80
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:31,750
Look!

81
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:32,830
I can fly now!

82
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,600
I can fly now.

83
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,240
It's truly lawless and boundless.

84
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:40,430
It seems it's really him.

85
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:42,200
I can fly now.

86
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:57,810
You can fly too?

87
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,070
This bird is really beautiful.

88
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,570
We still need to rely on mechanical birds.

89
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,560
We're not as skilled as you.

90
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,800
You don't need to rely on anything.

91
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:04,560
The sky is vast and the earth is wide.

92
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,750
You can go anywhere.

93
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,870
You can run and fly

94
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,190
whenever you want.

95
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,600
Come, reach out your hand.

96
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,190
This is so much fun.

97
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,159
Is this the former Liujiao Palace?

98
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,480
It's the most recent one.

99
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:46,870
Dreams are disordered.

100
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,680
There's no need to follow the rules of time either.

101
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,360
I see.

102
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,920
Is that all you've got?

103
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,050
With your level of skill,

104
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,360
even if you practice for another 500 years,

105
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,800
you still won't be a match for me.

106
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,870
That voice sounds so familiar.

107
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:04,240
You useless people,

108
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,350
get out of my sight!

109
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:06,890
Yes.

110
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,040
It's not just the voice that's familiar.

111
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,270
Isn't this you?

112
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,750
So in his heart,

113
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:17,270
this is how I am.

114
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,830
Here comes another newcomer.

115
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,920
Kneel before me now!

116
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,000
Pay your respects to me, the first handmaiden.

117
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,720
First... handmaiden?

118
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,920
You won't kneel, huh?

119
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:36,210
Then pay with your life!

120
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,310
Where on earth is the consciousness owner of this level?

121
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,030
How would I know?

122
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:09,190
You have to find him yourself.

123
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,630
I don't have time to search!

124
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,720
I understand now.

125
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,390
What?

126
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:16,800
Although she's overbearing,

127
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,560
she's always tightly

128
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,800
guarding this gate.

129
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:22,190
You think that what she's protecting...

130
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,800
Should be the consciousness owner of this level.

131
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,430
Don't go in!

132
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,390
Is it him?

133
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,360
Stop it, all of you!

134
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,310
Don't touch him!

135
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:12,920
Don't touch him!

136
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,390
I forbid you to touch him!

137
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,430
She's clearly protecting him,

138
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,140
yet she can't get close to him,

139
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:19,920
and she looks like this too.

140
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,040
It seems in his heart,

141
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,890
he both trusts and doubts you.

142
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:26,160
He wants to rely on you

143
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,630
but also wants to stay away from you.

144
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,510
He also feels that you're dangerous.

145
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,150
Don't touch him!

146
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,000
Are you ready?

147
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,840
-Elder!
-Elder!

148
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,720
I beg the Elder to show mercy.

149
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:00,960
Please spare my son.

150
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,320
Elders, I beg you all.

151
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,480
Please spare my son.

152
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,690
Elder, Elder,

153
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,240
I beg you to spare my son.

154
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,080
He's my only son.

155
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,790
Elder, I beg you.

156
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,430
Please let him go, Elder.

157
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,510
-Father!
-Husband!

158
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,390
You're out of touch with the times.

159
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,120
Husband!

160
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,240
Spare no one.

161
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:18,750
Father.

162
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,390
Kill.

163
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,870
It wasn't like this.

164
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,240
I've heard about this incident.

165
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,360
There were indeed many children

166
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,750
who were taken to Tianqu Peak.

167
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,550
Their families came to negotiate

168
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:31,720
and the two sides clashed.

169
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,080
That's how the disaster unfolded.

170
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,000
But at that time, Dingxu and Xinyao

171
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,240
weren't even at the scene.

172
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,440
This is his dream.

173
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,630
He wasn't there at the time.

174
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,000
All of this

175
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,790
must be his imagination.

176
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,120
Elders, Elders,

177
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,030
I beg for your mercy.

178
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,320
Please spare my son.

179
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,550
It's starting again.

180
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:01,750
How could this happen?

181
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,060
This dream is endless,

182
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,600
without beginning or end.

183
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:06,670
It's clear that this matter

184
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,240
holds a significant place in his heart.

185
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,360
Elder, have mercy.

186
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,510
Please spare my son.

187
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,390
Elder, please release my son.

188
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:13,120
Elders, I beg you all,

189
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,240
please spare my son.

190
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,080
Elders…

191
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,600
You're out of touch with the times.

192
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:24,320
It seems Yuanzhong isn't in this scene.

193
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,080
This dream is so

194
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,150
painful for him.

195
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,510
He certainly wouldn't want

196
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:31,440
to be present himself.

197
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:32,750
But he must be in here somewhere,

198
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:33,390
right?

199
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:34,030
Yes.

200
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,240
Where do you think he might be?

201
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:39,840
His parents and sister

202
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,240
died because of him.

203
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,440
He feels deeply guilty,

204
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,600
yet is powerless to change anything.

205
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,200
I guess he should be

206
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,720
the most helpless one.

207
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:00,910
Found him.

208
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:02,720
Let's quickly move to the next level.

209
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:03,600
Wait a moment.

210
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,200
It's okay now. It's okay now.

211
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,120
It's okay now. It's okay now.

212
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:15,920
There, there, there. It's okay now.

213
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:18,950
There, there.

214
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,360
We can go now.

215
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,080
They told me to guard them,

216
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,750
but with my limited magical power,

217
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,200
I can't handle this.

218
00:11:59,080 --> 00:11:59,870
Yunniang?

219
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:35,720
My good Kai Shan,

220
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,440
you've come at the right time.

221
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,360
Quick, save them.

222
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:57,280
I'll take care of this.

223
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:57,940
Alright.

224
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,390
Yuanzhong.

225
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,150
A woman?

226
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:31,630
This isn't right.

227
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,720
I'm the only one locked up here.

228
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,150
Looks like I'm dreaming again.

229
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:39,080
No, you're not dreaming.

230
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:42,200
Yuanzhong,

231
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,720
look at me.

232
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,270
I'm Ji Tanyin.

233
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,150
Don't you recognize me?

234
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:53,120
This dream is a bit noisy.

235
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,440
What are you trying to do?

236
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,910
I just want to touch you.

237
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:02,720
Don't try that.

238
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,630
You're trying to take my golden hoop, aren't you?

239
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,630
I'm not.

240
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,030
Of course you won't admit it.

241
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,200
I'm warning you,

242
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,670
don't be delusional.

243
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,440
This golden hoop is very important to me.

244
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:13,600
Thanks to it

245
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,030
suppressing my Divine Hand,

246
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:16,290
I'm able to understand

247
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,960
many things I couldn't before.

248
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:27,840
Let me tell you a secret.

249
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,200
I've actually had an epiphany.

250
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,240
I've seen through it all.

251
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,390
I completely understand now.

252
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:33,550
Understand what?

253
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,080
Everything they said is true.

254
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:37,270
The Five Sins really exist.

255
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,870
Take Dingxu for example.

256
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,650
You're a person in my dream,

257
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:43,720
so you must know about Dingxu, right?

258
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:46,960
Then tell me,

259
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:48,510
why did Dingxu

260
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,630
instigate everyone

261
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,200
to lock me up?

262
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,200
Why?

263
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,550
Because he's jealous.

264
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,080
He's jealous that I became

265
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,120
the host of the Divine Hand.

266
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:56,840
He's jealous of the

267
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,840
glorious military achievements I've made.

268
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:58,910
He covets this power,

269
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,360
but he can't obtain it.

270
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,600
So he suppresses me,

271
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,240
wishing he could lock me in hell

272
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,390
for eternity with no chance of redemption.

273
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,390
That seems to make some sense.

274
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:10,120
Of course it makes sense,

275
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,750
because this is the truth.

276
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,150
Think about it again.

277
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,150
Tanghua…

278
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,120
Why did Tanghua hide the truth

279
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,550
and stand with Dingxu?

280
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:19,750
Why?

281
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,150
Because he's a hypocrite.

282
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,670
He has never

283
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:24,080
treated me as a true friend.

284
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,960
Everything he said was false,

285
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,510
all just to appease

286
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:27,510
and deceive me.

287
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,360
He wants

288
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,510
to gain benefits,

289
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,080
yet he also wants to be seen as a good person.

290
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,670
See how hypocritical he is?

291
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,720
And this is just what's shown to me.

292
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,790
But if you look at the mortal realm,

293
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,480
the affairs of the world are no different.

294
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,600
The War Demon Clan

295
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,320
abandoned war for the sake of survival.

296
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,670
But in this vast world,

297
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:49,440
how could there not be room

298
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,600
for a clan?

299
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,240
They were just too greedy

300
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:53,320
and obsessed.

301
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:54,750
They wanted too much.

302
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,240
With the same principle,

303
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,670
let's look at the bigger picture.

304
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,200
This war between gods and demons

305
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,870
was nothing but a seed of cruelty

306
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,630
that had been infinitely magnified.

307
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,270
Think about it carefully.

308
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,270
What's the essential difference

309
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,790
between gods and demons?

310
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:11,600
They're just manifestations of human desires.

311
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,000
One thought makes one a god.

312
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,510
One thought makes one a demon.

313
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:16,000
It's not like that.

314
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:19,390
No?

315
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,320
Don't tell me you believe in gods.

316
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,510
I do.

317
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,120
Ignorance.

318
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,120
Utter ignorance.

319
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:35,130
The believers chant prayers day and night,

320
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:36,520
bowing three times and kowtowing nine times daily.

321
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,840
They rejoice when gods love the world

322
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,510
and grieve when gods abandon it.

323
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,200
But in essence,

324
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,630
isn't it just worshipping divine power

325
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:45,720
and the powerful,

326
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,360
while also fearing

327
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,860
being abandoned by the powerful?

328
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,430
If this isn't ignorance, then what is it?

329
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,620
The ignorance of the weak

330
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,680
is incurable.

331
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:57,880
Therefore,

332
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:00,000
they are not wrong.

333
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:02,270
The Five Sins are the source of all evil.

334
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,440
To restore clarity to this world,

335
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:06,160
we must cleanse the Five Sins.

336
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,270
If the Five Sins are not eliminated,

337
00:17:07,369 --> 00:17:08,329
the Great Way will be blocked.

338
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,589
If the Great Way is blocked,

339
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,880
then the small evils of the world

340
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:12,270
will accumulate

341
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:14,000
and become great evils, extreme evils.

342
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,390
Then this world will be done for.

343
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:19,920
Do you think I'm right?

344
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:23,750
Let's eat something first.

345
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,109
I'm not hungry.

346
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,589
You should eat even if you're not hungry.

347
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,760
It's a good time to think about what you said.

348
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:33,790
You think I'm noisy.

349
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,200
I don't.

350
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,480
If you don't, then think about it now.

351
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,880
I can think without eating.

352
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:39,400
What I want to say is simple.

353
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,960
The Five Sins truly exist.

354
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,310
The Five Sins are the source of all evil.

355
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:43,880
To restore clarity to this world,

356
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,510
we must cleanse these Five Sins.

357
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,480
The Five Sins are extraordinary.

358
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,350
They're interdependent and mutually reinforcing.

359
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,030
Take jealousy for example.

360
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,680
Without jealousy, there would be no greed.

361
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,240
Without greed, there would be no hypocrisy.

362
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,720
-Without hypocrisy, there would be no...
-Yuanzhong!

363
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,000
You're too tired, Yuanzhong.

364
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:04,890
Take a rest.

365
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:09,060
I can't. I can't.

366
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,000
It's okay.

367
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,110
Everything you said is right.

368
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,840
This is just a dream.

369
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,110
Come out quickly!

370
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:44,480
Come on!

371
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,240
Come, come here, quickly!

372
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:19,110
You go first.

373
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,500
[War Demon Clan, Han Jiang]

374
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:01,950
Yunniang!

375
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,680
Yunniang, Yunniang.

376
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,780
Yunniang, how are you?

377
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:20,370
Yunniang, how are you?

378
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,750
Don't scare me.

379
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,000
Jiu.

380
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:26,170
Take the children and go first.

381
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,750
What are you saying?

382
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,470
I can't escape anymore.

383
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,980
I'm just a burden if you take me with you.

384
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:36,350
Don't say that.

385
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,310
Don't say that.

386
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:38,920
Don't say that.

387
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:41,640
Don't say that.

388
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,300
Yunniang.

389
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:52,490
♫Time never defeats the fleeting world♫

390
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,450
Do you remember

391
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:56,480
♫Stars turn, shining upon the passing traveler♫

392
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,440
the notebook I gave you?

393
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:56,810
Of course I remember.

394
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:59,410
♫The wind rises, flowers fall and bloom again♫

395
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:03,550
♫Awaiting what’s lost to be regained♫

396
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,240
Give it back to me.

397
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:06,890
♫These countless sorrows and joys♫

398
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:07,830
Let me see it.

399
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:11,310
♫Dusk and dawn, only you make parting hard♫

400
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,110
You must let me see it.

401
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,270
Understand?

402
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:16,990
♫I'm willing to risk my life for this♫

403
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,070
What are you going to do?

404
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,110
What are you going to do?

405
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,110
Silly.

406
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,720
♫If our promise♫

407
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:24,920
♫Is to share this land and rivers♫

408
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,470
I'm going to save you.

409
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:29,020
♫If fate leads us astray♫

410
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:32,720
♫Life and death become our bond♫

411
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:36,170
♫Storms heal with time♫

412
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:41,140
♫Memories will shine in the end♫

413
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:37,830
I forgot to tell you.

414
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,110
You look so beautiful in your

415
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:46,640
♫That very first heartbeat, I will remember until the last♫

416
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,230
wedding dress today.

417
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:54,710
♫That very first heartbeat, I will remember until the last♫

418
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,720
Jiu.

419
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,700
Jiu, Jiu.

420
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,270
Jiu.

421
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,510
Jiu.

422
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,480
A bunch of unknown

423
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,240
bastards who came out of nowhere.

424
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,200
Come on!

425
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,640
Get a taste of my

426
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,590
ultimate moves!

427
00:22:58,790 --> 00:22:59,590
Lu Chen.

428
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:03,660
Kill the enemy first.

429
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:15,650
I didn't expect

430
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:17,530
the sea of consciousness to really be a sea.

431
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,920
Why didn't you appear just now?

432
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,920
The Yuanzhong from that previous layer

433
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,070
was unstable.

434
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,310
He was in a state of frenzy.

435
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,240
If he saw me,

436
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:26,820
he might've done

437
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:28,090
unpredictable things.

438
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,920
Anyway, we don't have much time left.

439
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,440
Which layer of the dream is this?

440
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,430
In this sea of consciousness, there's nothing

441
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:33,400
other than the water.

442
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:34,830
Where could he be?

443
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,110
Could he be in the water?

444
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,750
No.

445
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:41,590
Are you sure?

446
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,720
Definitely.

447
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:45,750
You're so certain

448
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:46,640
because your true self

449
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,160
has already searched in the water.

450
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,750
Stop pretending.

451
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,510
You're not the original consciousness at all.

452
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,990
I underestimated you.

453
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,000
Ji Tanyin!

454
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:42,920
Whatever you're doing,

455
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,720
you need to come out quickly!

456
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,920
I can't hold on much longer.

457
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,200
How dare you, mortal!

458
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:56,790
In the presence of your lord,

459
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,720
kneel before me at once!

460
00:24:58,790 --> 00:24:59,880
You're not worthy of my respect.

461
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,750
How dare you use me to traverse the dreams?

462
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,070
You demon, you've got some nerve.

463
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:06,830
How did you figure it out?

464
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,110
Because it doesn't make sense.

465
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,790
If you were truly Yuanzhong's original self,

466
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,720
why couldn't you recognize

467
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,880
the consciousness owner of each layer?

468
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,790
I finally figured it out.

469
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:14,510
You are

470
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:15,960
instinctively rejected by Yuanzhong.

471
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:17,550
That's why he doesn't reveal himself to you.

472
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:20,030
So there's only one possibility left.

473
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:21,240
So that's how it is.

474
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,310
Too bad you've only realized it now.

475
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:24,440
It's too late.

476
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:26,400
We're already in his sea of consciousness.

477
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,310
Now I just need to find a way

478
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:29,400
to sink all the way down,

479
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:31,640
bypassing the other layers of dreams

480
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,160
straight to the ninth layer.

481
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,590
This is where your journey ends!

482
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:36,680
Die!

483
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,350
Come and try if you dare,

484
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:57,030
little girl.

485
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:58,720
As a mortal,

486
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,440
you might be quite powerful,

487
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:02,350
but to challenge me,

488
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,510
you're still far too weak.

489
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:06,480
If it weren't for the years of dormancy

490
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,640
that greatly reduced my power,

491
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,790
you'd be dead by now.

492
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:12,030
Such confidence.

493
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:14,430
Yuanzhong.

494
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:17,140
Original consciousness owner?

495
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:19,640
Is he alone?

496
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,030
Yes.

497
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,510
He's the Demon Lord's mount.

498
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,750
After the war between gods and demons,

499
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,310
he was hidden at the bottom of Orange Lake.

500
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,000
Through Pei Jiu,

501
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,200
he entered your body,

502
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,960
attempting to take over your body.

503
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,510
I've encountered many people on my way here.

504
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:31,590
Fighting them

505
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,640
took some time.

506
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,440
What you've seen might all have been him.

507
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,110
Things can change, but the essence remains the same.

508
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,270
It's just child's play.

509
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:43,960
Yuanzhong,

510
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:46,350
you've been deceived by the Five Sins.

511
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,480
Don't be so stubborn.

512
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,680
Yuanzhong.

513
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,680
This is all your fault.

514
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,960
Your cruelty knows no bounds.

515
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,480
Your hands are already stained with blood.

516
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:55,720
Atone for your sins.

517
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,510
Look at these people.

518
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,640
Which one do you like?

519
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,830
That's right.

520
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,200
I know which one you like.

521
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,510
Yuanzhong, don't resist.

522
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:07,750
Atone for your sins.

523
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,550
Your life has no meaning.

524
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:12,070
Come to me quickly.

525
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:13,960
If you were performing on the street,

526
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,030
I might be interested

527
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:16,160
in giving you a few coins.

528
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:18,880
What's wrong? Don't you like this?

529
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,920
Isn't this how she looked

530
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,240
in your imaginations?

531
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,240
Look at that sea.

532
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,920
It's pitch black with raging storms and snow.

533
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:31,640
Your sea of consciousness is so dark.

534
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:33,790
It's almost identical to the mindset

535
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:35,030
of us demons.

536
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:37,640
You were born a demon seed.

537
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,110
Quickly join us.

538
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,480
Become one with me.

539
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,640
Become a member of the demon clan.

540
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,000
If you don't take the easy way, you'll have to take the hard way.

541
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,790
I'll kill you two.

542
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:56,960
Leave this to me.

543
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,120
I'll go with you.

♫I will travel the world and scatter the fog♫

566
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,310
Today, I wish to cleanse the Five Sins with heavenly fire.

567
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:53,010
The five of you are needed as sacrifices.

568
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,270
Are you willing to sacrifice yourselves?

569
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,640
We are willing.

570
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:58,550
Very well.

571
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,350
To keep the heavenly fire burning,

572
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,370
the Divine Hand must also serve as fuel.

573
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,200
As the saying goes,

574
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,590
if I don't enter hell, who will?

575
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,630
You actually want to use the Divine Left Hand

576
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,200
to destroy this world?

577
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:36,230
I won't destroy this world.

578
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:39,420
I'll merely cleanse it with heavenly fire.

579
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:41,980
You've become a demon.

580
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,850
Become a demon?

581
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:58,430
I heard you want to devour me.

582
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:08,960
Oh no, I can't hold it back anymore.

583
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:09,750
Hold on.

584
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:10,890
Yuanzhong hasn't woken up yet.

585
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:12,840
Do you think I don't want to hold on?

586
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:18,400
Yuanzhong.

587
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,440
You're alright now?

588
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:20,900
I was fine all along.

589
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:33,270
I originally wanted to let you

590
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:34,510
live a bit longer,

591
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:37,110
but you're seeking your own death.

592
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:39,490
So don't blame me.

593
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:50,190
Come in.

594
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,270
You're awake.

595
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,520
Is everything alright?

596
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:09,310
It feels like I've had a long dream,

597
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,110
but I can't remember

598
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:11,640
what happened in the dream.

599
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,510
The matters here are settled.

600
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:15,070
Are you willing

601
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,590
to continue to Yandu with me?

602
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:18,640
Of course.

603
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:19,640
Really?

604
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,000
Yuanzhong,

605
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,640
my life, death, honor, and disgrace are all tied to you.

606
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:27,810
I will naturally put you first in everything.

607
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,440
Besides, we made

608
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,120
that decision together.

609
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,310
Then let's pack up

610
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,960
and set off immediately.

611
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:36,960
Alright.

612
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,130
Yunniang, you're here.

613
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,790
Miss Ji,

614
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,350
I'm here to see Pei Jiu.

615
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:49,590
Is he inside?

616
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:51,930
He…

617
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,860
I'm here. What's the matter?

618
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,510
I'm wearing a hairpin today.

619
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,610
It was given by you.

620
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,720
It was given by Pei Jiu.

621
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,270
Why are you in such a hurry

622
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:44,550
to distance yourself from me?

623
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,480
We were just passing acquaintances.

624
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:49,240
There was never any relationship.

625
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:51,030
I won't interfere with Pei Jiu's life,

626
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,240
and as for my life,

627
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:54,310
I hope he can do the same.

628
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,880
Just passing acquaintances?

629
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,160
You've really changed into a different person.

630
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:07,680
You left

631
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,070
this with me.

632
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,840
You were worried you might forget,

633
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:13,790
so you specifically instructed me

634
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:16,520
to make sure I handed it to you personally.

635
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:26,630
In Pei Jiu's notebook,

636
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:27,510
there are many records

637
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:28,840
of his past with Yunniang.

638
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:30,960
After Lu Chen reads it,

639
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,590
he'll be swayed, right?

640
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,280
It's only human nature.

641
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:38,000
But what if

642
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,360
he decides not to go with you?

643
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:44,190
He won't read it.

644
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:05,920
My name is Lu Chen.

645
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:08,410
I'm one of the weapon spirits

646
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,510
of the Youhu Clan's High Priest.

647
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:11,230
Due to certain circumstances,

648
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:13,030
I had forgotten my past

649
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:14,880
and was in a daze for over 10 years.

650
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,190
You took care of me.

651
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:20,400
But I'm not from Orange Lake.

652
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:22,710
I have a past you don't know about

653
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:24,800
and a future you don't understand.

654
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,710
I am not Pei Jiu.

655
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,670
This notebook and you

656
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,630
have nothing to do with me.

657
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,800
Do you understand?

658
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,000
I understand.

659
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,670
That's good.

660
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:42,930
I'm about to leave this place.

661
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,670
Take care of yourself.

662
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,030
You too,

663
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,510
Mr. Lu Chen.

664
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,480
Pei Jiu won't come back anymore,

665
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,070
will he?

666
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,150
No, he won't.

667
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:58,190
I'll go out and have a look.

668
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:15,030
Do you really not remember anything?

669
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:16,760
Though the dream was beautiful,

670
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,760
it was nothing more than an illusion.

671
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,280
Now that I've awakened, my original intention remains unchanged.

672
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:22,960
There are more important things

673
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,920
waiting for me to do.

674
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:40,630
Lu Chen is still Lu Chen.

675
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,810
Is Yuanzhong still Yuanzhong?

676
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:47,840
Of course.

677
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,670
That's good.

678
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:05,280
[Orange Lake]

679
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:02,670
Immortal elders,

680
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:07,880
the villagers of Orange Lake have gathered

681
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:11,550
to wish you a safe journey.

682
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,070
Have a safe journey.

683
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,590
Why must Lu Chen

684
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:34,800
come with us?

685
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:37,230
Although he's a weapon spirit,

686
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,920
he has long since developed consciousness

687
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:40,590
and become an independent individual.

688
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:42,400
Can't we let him

689
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,300
choose based on his own preferences?

690
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,190
This is the path he has chosen.

691
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:47,920
You're only considering it

692
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,800
from Pei Jiu's perspective.

693
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:50,850
Why not consider Lu Chen's perspective?

694
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,280
Because

695
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,400
at least Pei Jiu

696
00:38:57,870 --> 00:38:59,750
was much happier than Lu Chen.

751
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:11,400
he can go to Yandu?

752
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,630
No, he wants to go to Su River.

753
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,110
Su River?

754
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:18,480
That place is remote.

755
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:20,550
It's far away and sparsely populated.

756
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:22,150
Why would he want to go there?

757
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,590
You lost this time, didn't you?

758
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:25,070
It doesn't count. You were too slow.

759
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:25,670
Let's do it again, come on.

760
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:26,590
It doesn't count again?

761
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:27,840
You're just a sore loser.

762
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:28,920
Yes,

763
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:30,670
I just want to go to Su River

764
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:31,670
to bring Ling Yao out.

765
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:33,110
You and Lu Chen can accompany them to Yandu,

766
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:34,320
and that's that!

767
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,800
What do you mean?

768
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,510
No way.

769
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,440
I want to go to Su River to pick up Ling Yao too.

770
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:43,030
With your dull appearance,

771
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:44,150
do you think she would like you?

772
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:45,590
What are you going there for?

773
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:46,880
Nonsense!

774
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,880
Ling Yao likes me very much.

775
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,880
Ling Yao is a woman?

776
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:56,590
A beautiful woman.
