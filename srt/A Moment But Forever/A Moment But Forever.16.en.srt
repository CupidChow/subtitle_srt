[A Moment But Forever]

00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,220
[Episode 16]

3
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:53,390
It's getting dark.

4
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:54,070
Shouldn't we

5
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,350
find a place to stay for the night?

6
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:58,310
There's a house ahead.

7
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:07,710
I never expected

8
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,470
to see you

9
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,030
again so soon, sir.

10
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:11,870
I knew

11
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,390
you'd come to my place.

12
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,390
Come in.

13
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:15,110
Come on, come on.

14
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:15,860
Come in.

15
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,480
[Library]

16
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,550
Is it

17
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,260
usually just you here, sir?

18
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,030
Yes.

19
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,829
I am the caretaker of this library.

20
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:33,310
You can call me Bao.

21
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,070
This library

22
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,560
looks quite old.

23
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:38,590
I wonder when it was built.

24
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:39,930
Oh, that was a long time ago.

25
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,480
Back then, when the Mute Goddess of Wu Mountain

26
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,950
passed through this area,

27
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,800
she saw the people living in poverty,

28
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,310
so she used her magic

29
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:50,540
to instantly create this library

30
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,230
to spread knowledge and enlighten the people.

31
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,550
If you really want to count the years,

32
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,810
it's been several hundred years.

33
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,350
The Mute of Wu Mountain?

34
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,180
Yeah.

35
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,390
You've heard of the Mute Goddess too?

36
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,190
I've heard that she was very knowledgeable,

37
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,190
kind, and intelligent,

38
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:06,870
and that she did a lot of

39
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,270
good things for the people.

40
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,390
This book records

41
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,670
many of her past deeds.

42
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:12,870
How much can such a thin book

43
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,270
really record?

44
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,860
There are many legends about the Mute Goddess.

45
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,110
When I have time later,

46
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,510
I'll tell you all about them.

47
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,150
There are over a hundred

48
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,270
libraries like this in the Eastern Wilderness,

49
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:26,400
all built by the Mute Goddess.

50
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,829
The collections inside

51
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:29,829
were all left by her.

52
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,550
Too many to count.

53
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:35,270
These are all treasures

54
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:36,110
the Mute Goddess left for us

55
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:38,230
to pass down from generation to generation.

56
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,910
She was really amazing,

57
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:40,900
not only helping common people

58
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,230
by doing so many good deeds

59
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,990
but also writing so many great books.

60
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,000
Yes, indeed.

61
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,110
Young lady,

62
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:50,030
the Mute Goddess of Wu Mountain is a god.

63
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:51,910
A god?

64
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:53,150
Yeah.

65
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,150
She descended from the heavens, riding a phoenix.

66
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:56,270
Wherever she went,

67
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,030
deserts transformed into lush oases.

68
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:00,200
Vicious thugs would abandon their wicked ways

69
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,630
upon seeing her,

70
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:03,710
while the kind-hearted would

71
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,240
receive blessings

72
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:06,570
and good fortune.

73
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:08,270
And the ignorant,

74
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:09,870
those simple and foolish ones,

75
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,840
would become extremely intelligent

76
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,710
the moment she touched their heads.

77
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,029
But why

78
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,829
is she called the Mute Goddess?

79
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,070
Is it because...

80
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:21,079
she couldn't speak?

81
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,910
The Mute Goddess possessed boundless magical powers.

82
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,470
Her words commanded reality.

83
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:27,070
Whatever she said would come true.

84
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,240
So,

85
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,860
she rarely opened her mouth to speak.

86
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,630
Isn't that a bit

87
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:34,630
exaggerated?

88
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:36,000
How am I exaggerating?

89
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,710
Everything I said is true.

90
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,270
It's all written in the books.

91
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:39,990
Come on, come on.

92
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:41,130
I'll find them and show you now.

93
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:42,190
No need, no need.

94
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:43,180
Reality and legend

95
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,430
are two different things, after all.

96
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,670
Reading it would just be a waste of time.

97
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,350
So you're saying

98
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:50,070
everything written in the books is false?

99
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,390
This library sheltering you for the night

100
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:53,300
is fake?

101
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,550
Even all the good deeds

102
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:55,430
that the Mute Goddess did

103
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,710
are just made up?

104
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:59,990
That's not what he meant.

105
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:01,060
Then what did he mean?

106
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,460
Since all the people of the Eastern Wilderness

107
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,390
all tell these stories

108
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,750
and are willing to worship the Mute Goddess,

109
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:07,790
there must be a reason for it!

110
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:08,390
Since you're now

111
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,070
taking shelter in one of the libraries

112
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,190
she built,

113
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:12,710
you should respect her

114
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:13,710
and be grateful to her!

115
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:15,350
Bao,

116
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,150
where are you going?

117
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,150
Don't call me "Bao."

118
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,110
We're not that close.

119
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:18,870
Wait,

120
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:19,710
where are the rooms?

121
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,070
Downstairs. Find it yourself!

122
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,590
This is a storage room.

123
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,230
This Bao is not being very hospitable.

124
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:31,720
Just make do.

125
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,150
Why complain so much?

126
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,070
Just now,

127
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,310
why didn't you let me speak?

128
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,460
I just thought

129
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,230
that since we're

130
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:40,390
staying at someone else's place,

131
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,030
even if you don't want to agree with him,

132
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:44,040
at least you shouldn't make him angry.

133
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:55,240
I don't think she's acting.

134
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,040
She's probably not the Mute Lady of Wu Mountain.

135
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,390
You've written this character wrong.

136
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:34,990
Why are you

137
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,390
standing behind me without making a sound?

138
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,470
You startled me.

139
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,190
I'm sorry.

140
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,750
I didn't mean to disturb you.

141
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,710
But

142
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,390
you did write that character wrong.

143
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:48,670
Impossible.

144
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:51,159
I copied it from the book exactly.

145
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:53,510
Look,

146
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:55,430
that book of yours

147
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,190
has been damaged by bookworms.

148
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:59,150
This phrase should be

149
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,350
"Winter ice can be broken;

150
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:01,990
summer twigs can be tied."

151
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,430
It means

152
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,270
that in winter, we obtain ice,

153
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,220
while in summer, we can gather twigs.

154
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,050
See,

155
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,270
there's an extra dot here.

156
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,470
You're right.

157
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,150
I misread it.

158
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:34,630
Well...

159
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:35,350
Bao,

160
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:36,950
you can't read?

161
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:37,950
That's right.

162
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:41,270
Then... how do you write?

163
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,790
Just copy it exactly as I see it.

164
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:44,700
I copied it wrong,

165
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:45,950
and I've copied so much.

166
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,880
I need to correct them quickly.

167
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,350
Do you have to recopy everything?

168
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:52,310
That's not necessary.

169
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,650
I only copied this one character wrong.

170
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:55,870
So,

171
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:58,350
I just need to recopy this page

172
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:00,190
and rebind it later.

173
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:01,680
But

174
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:03,270
if you can't read,

175
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:04,710
why are you

176
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,060
copying these books?

177
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:09,110
Although the Mute Goddess of Wu Mountain

178
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:10,310
watches over us,

179
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,260
we still

180
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,910
need to do our part.

181
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:15,230
These books are very precious.

182
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:16,670
These books are vulnerable

183
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:17,870
to fire, moisture, and insects.

184
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,390
So I figured

185
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:20,870
I should make more copies.

186
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:25,120
If they ever get damaged or destroyed,

187
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,110
at least there will be backups.

188
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,430
That way, the children won't

189
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,670
be left without books to read, right?

190
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:31,870
Even though

191
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:34,070
fewer people read books these days,

192
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,030
there will surely

193
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:37,669
be more in the future.

194
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:40,190
Then let me help you copy them.

195
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,720
That's great!

196
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:45,780
One piece for Yuanzhong.

197
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:47,120
One piece for me.

198
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:48,830
One piece for Zi Fei.

199
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,070
One piece for me.

200
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,150
One piece for Ji Tanyin...

201
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:54,830
You think you have too much?

202
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,750
No, whether it's too much or not is one thing,

203
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,750
but is it appropriate to divide it like this?

204
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,470
Aren't I just dividing it in order?

205
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,790
What order?

206
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:02,990
My order.

207
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:34,710
What's wrong?

208
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,460
D-Did I write something wrong?

209
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:38,110
Your handwriting...

210
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,350
is very good.

211
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:43,590
Wait a moment.

212
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,430
Let me show you something nice.

213
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:03,190
These are the original manuscripts

214
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:04,870
left by the Mute Goddess of Wu Mountain.

215
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,870
Only these few volumes remain now.

216
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:08,510
Take a look.

217
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,470
Right? Doesn't it look similar?

218
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,110
Your handwriting

219
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:25,230
is just like the Goddess's.

220
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:27,430
Both are written very well.

221
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:34,150
Bao.

222
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:36,430
What was

223
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:38,750
this place called before?

224
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,200
Rammed Earth City.

225
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,350
That's not right.

226
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,190
A long time ago,

227
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:46,190
the river to the south

228
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:47,310
hadn't split into multiple streams yet.

229
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:48,830
Whenever there was heavy rain,

230
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:50,550
it could potentially cause flooding.

231
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,590
The landscape at that time...

232
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,840
was quite different from what it is now.

233
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:58,540
Oh, you mean back then?

234
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:02,230
At that time, this place was called Chaotic Cloud Village.

235
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,470
This area had strong winds and many clouds.

236
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,350
The dark clouds in the sky...

237
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:07,790
well...

238
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:08,980
Anyway,

239
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,630
it was very chaotic around here back then.

240
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,270
That's why it got that name.

241
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,550
Later, the Mute Goddess

242
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:17,790
built the library using the rammed earth technique,

243
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,550
and then more and more people settled here.

244
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:21,820
So it was renamed Rammed Earth City.

245
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,690
Chaotic Cloud Village...

246
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:36,750
No wonder this place felt

247
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,230
somewhat familiar on my way here.

248
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:39,950
Chaotic Cloud Village...

249
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,550
When I came here back then,

250
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,070
there were only a dozen households.

251
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,590
Those books were also mine.

252
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,830
Could I be the Mute Lady of Wu Mountain?

253
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:49,590
But why would they call me "Mute"?

254
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:50,940
Oh, right.

255
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:52,840
When I crossed the Sea of Flux back then,

256
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,830
I was severely injured.

257
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:55,180
My throat hadn't recovered yet.

258
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,670
So I was indeed both deaf and mute at that time.

259
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:59,230
But I didn't ride a phoenix,

260
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,830
nor did I have the power to make my words command reality.

261
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:08,390
Why are you still up?

262
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:11,230
I'm not tired yet.

263
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:12,390
You weren't here just now.

264
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:13,430
Where did you go?

265
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:15,980
I went to copy books for Bao.

266
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,200
Don't listen to his nonsense.

267
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,390
The phoenix is a divine beast

268
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:22,790
with a proud nature.

269
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:23,510
It would never

270
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,990
serve as a mount for anyone.

271
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:26,110
That Mute Lady of Wu Mountain

272
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,390
did have some power,

273
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,110
but she was far from

274
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:30,310
being able to command reality with her words

275
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:31,990
or enlightening others with a mere touch to the head.

276
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,700
Our clan also has some

277
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,130
legends about gods,

278
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,790
but none as powerful

279
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:37,950
as that.

280
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:40,070
Then why

281
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:41,430
do they still spread such stories?

282
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,230
So-called legends

283
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,350
are nothing more than

284
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:48,380
stories passed down orally by people.

285
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:49,590
Since these are stories,

286
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:50,310
there are

287
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:52,470
some embellishments and exaggerations.

288
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,310
To make the stories stand out,

289
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,270
people add

290
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:57,540
their own speculations and interpretations.

291
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:58,710
As these stories spread from person to person,

292
00:12:58,710 --> 00:12:59,950
they become more and more far-fetched.

293
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:02,070
Rather than saying they believe in and worship gods,

294
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,910
it's more accurate to say they hope the gods

295
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,430
are as they imagine them to be,

296
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,190
doing what they hope will be done

297
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,150
and fulfilling the wishes they long for.

298
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:10,710
So,

299
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,790
although they worship the Mute Lady of Wu Mountain,

300
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:13,710
in reality,

301
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,230
they are worshipping

302
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,860
their own expectations for a better life?

303
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,510
Sort of.

304
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,630
Why do I feel

305
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:24,750
that you seem to really dislike

306
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:25,860
the Mute Lady of Wu Mountain?

307
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,950
Why should I like her?

308
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:41,470
Come on.

309
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:43,960
Take this to eat on your way.

310
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:45,260
That's not necessary.

311
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,270
We already have plenty

312
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,270
of food.

313
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,310
This is jerky I made myself.

314
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,540
It tastes really good.

315
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:51,670
Take it, take it.

316
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,550
Thank you, Bao.

317
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,110
There are books inside.

318
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,110
Read more books when you have time

319
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,230
and learn more things.

320
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,890
Don't stay a handmaiden to someone else.

321
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,430
Not only is it exhausting work,

322
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:03,710
but you're bound to be mistreated.

323
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:09,750
Well, he

324
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:12,150
just likes to get into the details sometimes

325
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,380
and is not good at saying nice things.

326
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,030
But actually,

327
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,390
he's a decent person.

328
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:18,550
Oh, right.

329
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,030
He asked me to leave this for you.

330
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:28,390
Give it back to him.

331
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,590
I don't want his money.

332
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:31,000
He already knows that he was wrong.

333
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:32,990
He's just too proud—

334
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:34,870
too embarrassed to apologize to you in person.

335
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:36,660
So he left this

336
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,870
as an apology.

337
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:40,590
Really?

338
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,600
That brat...

339
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,150
is not that bad.

340
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:42,710
What's wrong?

341
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,910
Kai Shan snored too loudly last night.

342
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,660
I didn't sleep well. My eyes hurt.

343
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:50,210
Then rest a bit more.

344
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,190
Do your eyes still hurt?

345
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,170
How are you feeling now?

346
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:50,910
Where did you learn that?

347
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:52,430
Just...

348
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:53,990
read it in a book earlier.

349
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,230
Don't bother learning

350
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:57,350
this nonsense.

351
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:58,710
What's wrong?

352
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:00,020
That wasn't helping?

353
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,109
I think it feels quite nice.

354
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:17,750
I'm going to sleep.

355
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,260
Don't disturb me.

356
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,510
The size here

357
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:08,550
needs to be adjusted again.

358
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,470
Okay.

359
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,950
This part still needs to be modified.

360
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:18,750
This really won't do.

361
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:19,110
It's too much!

362
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,070
Yes, that's it.

363
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:21,630
Young Master,

364
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:23,200
look who's here?

365
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:24,630
-Young Master.
-Young Master.

366
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:26,010
Chiyi, Xiazhi.

367
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:27,110
How are you doing?

368
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,020
Everything's fine.

369
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:30,170
Just... not quite used to living here.

370
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,550
The High Priest said you would come to us.

371
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:34,030
We've been waiting for you for a long time.

372
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,590
It was the High Priest

373
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:38,840
who saved our lives.

374
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:41,950
He cares about all of you.

375
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,540
It was all my fault. My reckless actions

376
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,180
nearly cost you your lives.

377
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:46,790
Young Master,

378
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:47,810
please don't say that.

379
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:49,670
From beginning to end,

380
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,480
this was all our own choice.

381
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:54,270
Young Master,

382
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:55,750
you've come to Yandu

383
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,470
to discuss joining forces with the human race

384
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,070
against the War Demon?

385
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,220
Yes, that's exactly why.

386
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:05,630
What's wrong?

387
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:06,670
Young Master,

388
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:09,060
there's been unrest in Yandu lately.

389
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,470
Have you heard about the Wushuang Society?

390
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:13,870
This Wushuang Society

391
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:14,990
is a human organization

392
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:15,910
that first surfaced

393
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:17,110
over a decade ago.

394
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,850
From the Eastern Wilderness to the Western Desert,

395
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:20,870
wherever there are human activities,

396
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:22,110
there are their members.

397
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:23,470
They claim

398
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:24,830
to serve the "Goddess Wushuang"

399
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:25,780
and say that the Youhu Clan

400
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:27,590
is the greatest threat to the human race.

401
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:30,030
In secret, they've been rapidly recruiting members,

402
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:31,200
growing ever more ambitious.

403
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:32,230
In recent years,

404
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:34,130
they've completely gone underground,

405
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:35,630
with unknown intentions.

406
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,630
There's an organization like that.

407
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:39,100
Xiazhi and I

408
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,590
stumbled upon some clues.

409
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:42,590
This Wushuang Society

410
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,030
seems to be secretly supporting

411
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:45,950
some people in the city

412
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:47,390
to trade with the War Demon.

413
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,220
Is this true?

414
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,610
There's absolutely no speculation.

415
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:51,850
It has been confirmed

416
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,810
that there's a Green Garden Trading House in the city

417
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:55,470
secretly trading in raw stones.

418
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:56,800
The amount is so large

419
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:57,990
that it's dozens of times

420
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,100
what's recorded in their accounts.

421
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,430
And all of these raw stones

422
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,380
are being transported to the Eastern Wilderness.

423
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:04,790
The Eastern Wilderness?

424
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:09,020
Before I left Baitou Mountain,

425
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:11,070
the High Priest gave me a clue.

426
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:12,950
It's about the War Demons'

427
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,750
hiding places in the Eastern Wilderness.

428
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:17,150
But we're in Yandu now.

429
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:18,820
We should first follow the trail

430
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:20,350
to find their contact person.

431
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:23,070
Xiazhi and I

432
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,790
have investigated secretly several times,

433
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,470
but they are heavily on guard and vigilant,

434
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,920
constantly leading us in circles.

435
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:30,030
However,

436
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:31,950
we're not completely empty-handed.

437
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:33,500
What did you find out?

438
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:35,670
The current proprietor of Green Garden Trading House

439
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:36,950
has been to Fangwai Mountain before.

440
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,750
This woman is named Lyu Yao,

441
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:39,780
the only daughter

442
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,230
of the former proprietor of Green Garden Trading House.

443
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,910
Because she admired our Youhu Clan,

444
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,270
at the Handmaiden Selection,

445
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,870
she passed through numerous tests

446
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:46,830
and became

447
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:47,790
a handmaiden at Fangwai Mountain.

448
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:50,100
Later, due to her father's sudden death,

449
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:51,180
she returned home for the funeral

450
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,110
and never went back to the mountain.

451
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,180
Humans have always valued filial piety.

452
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:57,150
Is there anything suspicious about this?

453
00:20:58,350 --> 00:20:59,300
But her father,

454
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,340
that former proprietor,

455
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,380
had already died three years ago.

456
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:29,470
Young Master,

457
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:30,810
what's wrong?

458
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,110
Nothing.

459
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,430
Let's go.

460
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:40,340
Who are you?

461
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:45,470
Young Mistress Dai?

462
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,120
Quickly, report to the Young City Lord.

463
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,150
Yes, sir.

464
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,320
Greetings, Young Mistress Dai.

-Greetings, Young Mistress Dai!
-Greetings, Young Mistress Dai!

467
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,110

468
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:21,670
Is it really you, Dai?

469

[Zhi Yue; Young City Lord of Yandu; Human]

Zhi Yue

471
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:36,360
greets Elder Sister.

472
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:43,430
That eastern pavilion

473
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:44,870
and this corridor

474
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:46,360
were both newly built two years ago.

475
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:48,310
The pond in front

476
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,420
has remained unchanged.

477
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:51,510
The elders in our family say

478
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,110
that when I was little,

479
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,670
I often sneaked in there to play.

480
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:56,550
I got scolded quite a bit for that.

481
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:57,670
Dai,

482
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,190
do you remember?

483
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:01,790
When I left,

484
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:03,070
you were just

485
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:04,200
a mischievous little child.

486
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:08,510
This used to be a training ground, right?

487
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:09,870
I remember that Father

488
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:11,390
often practiced martial arts here.

489
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:13,230
Where is Father?

490
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,110
After taking

491
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:16,590
the Essence Nourishing Pill that Shen Ying sent,

492
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:17,990
he has been in seclusion, absorbing it.

493
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,940
I believe that in a few more days,

494
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,750
he'll be able to come out and see us.

495
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,830
If he sees that you've returned,

496
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:25,380
he'll surely be overjoyed.

497
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,110
Dai,

498
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:29,950
after Father takes the pill,

499
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,670
will he return to his youth like you?

500
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:33,470
I don't know.

501
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:34,910
Maybe.

502
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:39,150
These years, I've often wandered abroad,

503
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:40,070
and you've been helping Father

504
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:41,780
with everything at home.

505
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,800
Thank you for your hard work.

506
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,730
There's no need to say such things among family.

507
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:47,150
Dai,

508
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,550
having you back is better than anything.

509
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:51,630
I'm very pleased to see that you can now

510
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:53,310
handle things on your own.

511
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:56,130
Dai, you flatter me.

512
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:59,910
There used to be a rockery here,

513
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:01,870
but it collapsed due to heavy rain,

514
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:02,990
so we simply removed it altogether.

515
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:04,910
The buildings behind

516
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,750
were all built at the same time.

517
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:08,780
There's also a terrace on the top floor.

518
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:10,300
On a good night,

519
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:13,130

hasn't changed at all.

00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:40,150

527

as it was when you left.

528
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,410

00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:11,010
that makes you so cautious?

I'm sure.

539
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:22,470

to harm the Youhu Clan

541

wanted to leave this matter for Father to decide.

But given the current situation,

545
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,430
I'm afraid the War Demon will have already begun

546
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:34,180
causing havoc by the time he comes out of seclusion.

547
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:40,940

00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:41,580
left in this money pouch.

572
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:43,040
Should we throw that guy

573
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:43,950
out now?

574
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:50,350
Go to the kitchen and get a knife.

575
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:51,350
Let's just...

576
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,950
end him with one slash.

577
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,270
No, no, no.

578
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,060
Madam,

579
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:56,830
I mean, sure,

580
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:57,870
he owes us some money,

581
00:26:57,870 --> 00:26:59,350
but we shouldn't kill him for that.

582
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:01,560
Killing someone is against the law.

583
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,340
How would we live afterward?

584
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:07,030
Oh, so you do know that?

585
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:07,950
He's so severely injured!

586
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:08,750
If you throw him out now,

587
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:09,950
how is that any different from killing him?

588
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:11,540
Have you lost your conscience?

589
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:15,030
But that wasn't my idea.

590
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:16,550
Weren't you the one who instructed earlier

591
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:17,590
to throw him out

592
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:18,550
when his money runs out?

593
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,780
I was just saying that casually!

594
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,110
Can't you just take it lightly?

595
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,150
Did you really have to take it so seriously?

596
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:27,630
We have customers.

597
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,100
Si, we have customers!

598
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,350
Dear customers, are you here to stay

599
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,380
or to dine?

600
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:35,590
To stay.

601
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:36,620
Four deluxe rooms.

602
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:37,630
What a coincidence!

603
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:39,190
Our inn has exactly four deluxe rooms available.

604
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,340
Please come in.

605
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:41,590
Si!

606
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:42,480
Take care of their carriage

607
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:43,310
and feed the horses well!

608
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:43,910
Got it.

609
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:44,510
Come in.

610
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:44,910
Please come in.

611
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:45,790
San,

612
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:47,070
take the customers upstairs!

613
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:47,790
Got it.

614
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:48,510
Come on,

615
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:49,510
this way, please.

616
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,270
Please come in, dear customers.

617
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,030
What do you think?

618
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:00,030
Are you satisfied?

619
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:01,750
It's good.

620
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:04,150
Then I won't disturb your rest.

621
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:05,000
Hey, buddy.

622
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:06,540
I'd like to ask you about a place.

623
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,910
Do you know how to get to Orange Lake?

624
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:10,910
This is Orange Lake, right here.

625
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,830
I'm talking about an actual lake,

626
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,270
not our town.

627
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:15,950
Oh, you mean that lake.

628
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:16,530
Yes.

629
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:17,740
It's over on the west side of town.

630
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,790
Would you mind

631
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:19,670
showing me the way?

632
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:20,430
Sure, no problem.

633
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:21,580
This way, please, sir.

634
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,160
Then I'll go with you.

635
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:25,270
You should go back to your room and rest.

636
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:26,830
Zi Fei and Kai Shan will accompany me.

637
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:27,670
Then...

638
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:29,430
I'll prepare some food for you

639
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:30,350
for when you return.

640
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:51,870
Come in.

641
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:02,250
I'm Shen Ying, the Foreign Affairs Scribe of Yandu.

642
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,200
Greetings, Mr. Tanghua.

643
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:05,710
Please, have a seat.

644
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:07,590
Thank you, Mr. Tanghua.

645
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:16,990
May I ask why you've

646
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:18,390
summoned me here?

647
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:19,710
When I was on the tower ship,

648
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:21,150
I already told you

649
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:22,390
that I would come in person

650
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:23,950
to pay a formal visit to the City Lord of Yandu.

651
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:27,100
To discuss eliminating the remnants of the War Demons?

652
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:28,470
That's right.

653
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:29,510
I have already

654
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,750
reported this to the City Lord.

655
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:34,070
Now that you're here in person,

656
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:35,830
it is only right that I arrange

657
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:37,710
a meeting for you as soon as possible.

658
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:38,830
"It is only right?"

659
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:39,910
Yes.

660
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:42,260
Unfortunately, the timing is not ideal.

661
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:45,030
The City Lord is currently in seclusion.

662
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,500
"The timing is not ideal?"

663
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:49,800
Of all times, he chooses to enter seclusion

664
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,350
the moment I arrive?

665
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:54,240
It really is a coincidence.

666
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:55,780
But I assure you,

667
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:57,850
there's no intention to disrespect you.

668
00:29:58,590 --> 00:29:59,390
Fine.

669
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,060
Then I'll wait for him to come out of seclusion.

670
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:03,750
By the way, Mr. Shen,

671
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:06,390
have you heard of the Wushuang Society?

672
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:11,550
Wushuang Society?

673
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:16,150
I think... I've heard of it.

674
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:19,070
It should be a guild for craftsmen.

675
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:21,160
Not just craftsmen, right?

676
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:25,430
I'm afraid I don't understand.

677
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:27,270
Please enlighten me, Mr. Tanghua.

678
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:29,460
It seems this Wushuang Society

679
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:30,910
has connections with many

680
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:32,710
merchant guilds in Yandu City

681
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:34,870
and is secretly aiding the War Demons.

682
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:37,070
This... this is impossible!

683
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:41,050
Mr. Shen, do you really not know,

684
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:42,970
or are you just pretending not to know?

685
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:45,840
Mr. Tanghua,

686
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:47,190
where did you hear

687
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:48,730
such rumors?

688
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,800
This is a serious matter.

689
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:51,590
We mustn't jump to conclusions based on hearsay.

690
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:52,710
Without evidence,

691
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:54,380
how could I make such baseless claims?

692
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,790
The fact that War Demon remnants still exist

693
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:58,220
is undeniable.

694
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:00,030
They're hiding and lying low,

695
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:01,670
which means they are struggling to survive.

696
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,820
If no other forces had been lending a hand,

697
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:05,710
I don't believe they could have remained hidden for so long.

698
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,510
Now, the three major races dominate the world.

699
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:11,230
My Youhu Clan and the War Demons

700
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:12,920
have an irreconcilable blood feud.

701
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:15,100
As for who has been aiding them,

702
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:16,830
isn't that obvious?

703
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:19,870
Mr. Tanghua, you are mistaken.

704
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,820
The Youhu Clan and the War Demon

705
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,470
indeed have a deep blood feud.

706
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,230
But our human race has also suffered greatly

707
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:26,950
from the War Demon's slaughter and enslavement.

708
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:28,910
Their atrocities

709
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:30,150
are deeply etched in our memories.

710
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:30,830
Our hatred towards them

711
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:32,550
is no less than that of your esteemed clan.

712
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,840
This matter must be thoroughly investigated.

713
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:39,030
We must not let those with ulterior motives

714
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,670
take advantage of this to drive a wedge between us.

715
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:41,310
Alright.

716
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:42,430
That's exactly what I was waiting

717
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:43,630
for you to say.

718
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:45,830
In the southern part of the city, on Licorice Street,

719
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:47,310
there's a Green Garden Trading House.

720
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:49,100
Its proprietor is named Lyu Yao.

721
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:50,790
Come to think of it,

722
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:52,200
this person was actually brought back

723
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,350
to Yandu City by you.

724
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:54,400
Is that right?

725
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:56,180
Yes.

726
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,150
Her father died suddenly,

727
00:31:58,190 --> 00:31:59,990
so she went back home for the funeral.

728
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:02,350
Then, let's start investigating from here.

729
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:04,830
She's had two fathers die within three years.

730
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:07,110
Let's first find out how many fathers she actually has.

731
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:29,150
Wonderful, wonderful indeed!

732
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,990
This melody is like a gift from the heavens.

733
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:34,630
Dai, I didn't know you had such skill with the zither.

734
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:36,830
It's truly astonishing.

735
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:38,220
Just playing around.

736
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,270
Aren't you busy with your official duties today?

737
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:42,710
Though official duties keep me busy,

738
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:43,710
I can always make time

739
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:44,680
to see you.

740
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:46,830
It's strange.

741
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:48,510
Though I haven't spent much time

742
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:49,390
with you in this life,

743
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:51,750
now I find myself thinking of you often.

744
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:54,590
Perhaps this is what they call the bond of family.

745
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:56,190
That must be it.

746
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:58,550
Before you returned,

747
00:32:58,550 --> 00:32:59,300
I worried every day

748
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,710
about Father's seclusion.

749
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,350
Sometimes, I couldn't even eat or sleep properly.

750
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:03,750
Now, it's different.

751
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:05,990
Knowing that you are here in the same place,

752
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,150
my heart

753
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:08,540
feels much more at ease.

754
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,470
I feel the same way.

755
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,250
I have wandered for half of my life,

756
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,980
only to realize now how precious family is.

757
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:19,470
Dai, just now,

758
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:20,590
what piece were you playing?

759
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:21,740
It was so beautiful.

760
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:23,470
I don't know either.

761
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,590
When Mom taught me,

762
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:26,830
she never mentioned its name.

763
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,490
It was the First Madam who taught you.

764
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:33,200
But ever since I can remember,

765
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:35,270
she had always been bedridden.

766
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:36,790
I'd never

767
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:38,230
heard her play the zither.

768
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:41,390
At that time,

769
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:42,910
she lived in the Yangyu Tower.

770
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:44,470
Because she couldn't stand the wind,

771
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:47,070
the doors and windows were always kept closed.

772
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:49,070
But I often sneaked in there

773
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:50,780
and got beaten quite some times for it.

774
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:53,350
Although Father usually doted on me,

775
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:54,550
he never

776
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:56,110
held back when punishing me

777
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:57,870
if I disturbed First Madam's rest.

778
00:33:58,630 --> 00:33:59,780
But even so,

779
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:01,270
I would still go there often.

780
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:03,240
I was young at that time

781
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:04,120
and didn't know any better.

782
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:06,790
I had no self-control when it came to food and drink.

783
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:09,150
I especially loved sweets.

784
00:34:09,409 --> 00:34:11,130
The whole household kept me in check,

785
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:12,630
except for the First Madam.

786
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,889
Every time I visited, she would give me malt sugar.

787
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,239
I still remember clearly

788
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:20,790
the night when she left this world.

789
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:22,600
The wind was still,

790
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:24,150
and the moon was full.

791
00:34:24,989 --> 00:34:25,659
By then,

792
00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:27,230
she could no longer speak.

793
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:30,270
But she was still happy to see me.

794
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:34,550
Finally, with trembling hands,

795
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:36,710
she gave me one last handful of malt sugar.

796
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:40,350
Dai.

797
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:42,630
That handful of malt sugar...

798
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:44,909
was the sweetest thing

799
00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:46,270
I've ever tasted in my life.

800
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:54,070
Young Lord and Young Mistress,

801
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:55,610
Shen Ying, Scribe Shen, requests an audience.

802
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:57,130
Great.

803
00:34:57,570 --> 00:34:58,450
Please invite him in now.

804
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:10,940
Shen Ying pays his respects to the Young Lord and Young Mistress.

805
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:12,990
There's no need for such formalities among our own people.

806
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:13,950
Please, rise quickly.

807
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:15,590
Thank you, Young Lord.

808
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:19,910
You and your father

809
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:20,990
have been protecting my elder sister

810
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:22,110
for decades without fail.

811
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,310
This time, not only did you safely

812
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:24,470
bring her back home,

813
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:25,830
but you also brought back the medicinal pills.

814
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:27,750
That is a great merit.

815
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:29,190
So in my heart,

816
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,990
I've long seen you as family.

817
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:33,750
Thank you for your kindness, Young City Lord.

818
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:35,590
I dare not accept such an honor.

819
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:36,950
What are you afraid of?

820
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:38,430
When Father comes out of seclusion,

821
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:39,910
he will surely reward you generously.

822
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,510
You must also continue to work hard,

823
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:42,480
not slack off,

824
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:43,990
and make good use of opportunities.

825
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:45,190
Yes, Young Lord.

826
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,030
Dai,

827
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,660
I still have official duties to attend to.

828
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,880
I'll go take care of them now.

829
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:51,280
Take care of yourself too.

830
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,000
Don't overwork yourself.

831
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:53,130
I know.

832
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:54,950
Goodbye.

833
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:05,590
Young Mistress Dai,

834
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:07,290
Mr. Tanghua has come to Yandu.

835
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:12,260
Where are you gentlemen from?

836
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:13,000
From the east.

837
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:15,250
When I was feeding your horses earlier,

838
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,950
I noticed that the wheels of your carriage are badly worn.

839
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,390
You must have traveled a long way.

840
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:20,350
I have a friend

841
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:21,790
who specializes in repairing wheels.

842
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:23,230
Would you need his services?

843
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:24,350
If needed, I'd be happy to introduce him to you.

844
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:25,070
If necessary,

845
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:26,230
we'll certainly trouble you.

846
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,880
How far is it to Orange Lake?

847
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:29,590
It's right here.

848
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:32,510
When you mentioned Orange Lake earlier,

849
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:33,870
it didn't come to me at first.

850
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:35,230
We locals here

851
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:36,700
all call it Black Dragon Pool.

852
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,710
Why does this lake

853
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,070
have two names?

854
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:43,190
Years ago,

855
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:44,590
the elders of our town

856
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:46,110
said they saw a black dragon

857
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:47,350
coiled above the lake at night.

858
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:48,830
That's why it's called Black Dragon Pool.

859
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:49,990
But in the past couple of years,

860
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:50,910
no one has seen it again.

861
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:52,670
Thank you for leading the way.

862
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:53,670
Zi Fei.

863
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:55,370
We still need to look around this place,

864
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:56,580
so we won't take up any more of your time.

865
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:58,670
Thank you for the tip, sir.

866
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:13,640
It's here.

867
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:15,500
Then let's quickly rescue him.

868
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:22,030
Lu Chen,

869
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:23,190
return.

870
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,110
Lu Chen isn't here.

871
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:33,790
The seal has been broken?

872
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:35,430
Then where did he go?

873
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,580
I only realized afterward

874
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:44,390
that Mr. Tanghua had it all planned out.

875
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:46,310
He wants to use me

876
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,950
to uncover the truth of the matter.

877
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:50,350
Wasn't Lyu Yao already

878
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:51,870
secretly imprisoned by you?

879
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:53,030
How could she brazenly

880
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:53,830
escape

881
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:55,660
and get involved with the Wushuang Society?

882
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:57,590
Indeed.

883
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:59,620
I find it strange too.

884
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:01,070
This person

885
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:03,180
tried to assassinate the Youhu Clan's High Priest.

886
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:04,500
That's truly insane.

887
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,800
I originally planned to imprison her for a couple of years

888
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,910
as a warning.

889
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,950
But someone, I don't know who,

890
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:11,810
released her.

891
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:13,320
No matter who released her,

892
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:14,310
we can't let her

893
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:15,500
get away with it like this.

894
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:16,330
Yes.

895
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:18,750
As for that Wushuang Society,

896
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:20,830
if it's really as you say,

897
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:22,300
it's far too radical.

898
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:23,790
If left unchecked,

899
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:24,590
I'm afraid

900
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:26,230
it might really ignite a war between the two clans.

901
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:28,190
That's exactly what I'm worried about.

902
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:29,870
Here's what we'll do:

903
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,790
find a way to investigate the situation.

904
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:32,670
It would be best if you could

905
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:33,660
root them out completely.

906
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:34,750
Understood.

907
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:36,550
This matter must be handled discreetly.

908
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:38,870
Try not to arouse any suspicion from the Youhu Clan,

909
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:40,460
especially

910
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,470
Mr. Tanghua.

911
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,830
We need to nip it in the bud before he does,

912
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:45,580
to prevent exacerbating the conflict between our two clans

913
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:46,610
and causing misunderstandings.

914
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:48,910
Yes, Young Mistress.

915
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,310
With Lu Chen's abilities,

916
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:53,870
could he have

917
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:55,310
broken the seal himself?

918
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,390
He must have encountered something unexpected.

919
00:38:58,230 --> 00:38:59,510
No matter what he encountered,

920
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:00,710
since the seal has been broken,

921
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:02,150
why hasn't he come to find us?

922
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:03,580
Stop right there!

923
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:09,000
[Pei Jiu; Weapon Spirit]

924
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:22,270
Thank you.

925
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:35,030
Are you hungry?

926
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,900
Come on. Come in.

927
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:51,610
Here you go.

928
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,210
Eat slowly.

929
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,350
Don't choke yourself.

930
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:03,310
Si!

931
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:04,470
Stop what you're doing

932
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:05,750
and throw out that freeloader!

933
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,210
Who?

934
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:07,870
In this inn,

935
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:09,310
who else is freeloading?

936
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:11,770
Thank you, sister.

937
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:14,980
You mean the one in the backyard?

938
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:16,020
Yes, that's him.

939
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:18,250
But he's so badly injured

940
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,720
and hasn't woken up yet.

941
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,670
If you throw him out,

942
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:21,700
won't he end up dying on the streets?

943
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:22,190
We can't just

944
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:23,480
keep letting him stay here.

945
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,830
Business is so tough these days!

946
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:25,550
From morning till now,

947
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:26,430
we've had only one table of customers.

948
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:27,630
I'm barely keeping this small inn open,

949
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:28,150
and I can hardly

950
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:29,310
pay your wages.

951
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,670
I'd like to help him,

952
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:32,510
but I just can't afford to.

953
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:33,750
But didn't you say this morning...

954
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:34,350
Wh-Wh-What

955
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:35,470
did I say?

956
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:36,910
Who is that person?

957
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:39,450
Who knows who he is?

958
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:40,790
I encountered him while I was out.

959
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:41,310
Out of compassion,

960
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:42,470
I brought him back to save him.

961
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:43,150
That man

962
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:43,910
is severely injured

963
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:45,070
and has remained unconscious.

964
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:46,550
But calling a doctor costs money,

965
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:47,950
and so does buying medicine.

966
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:49,530
I really can't afford this anymore.

967
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:50,590
If I had any savings at all,

968
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:52,130
I certainly wouldn't turn a blind eye to him.

969
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:56,670
However, I think

970
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:57,480
this person should wake up

971
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,880
in another ten days or so.

972
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:00,270
But what if he doesn't wake up?

973
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:01,790
I still have this small inn to run.

974
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,540
I need to make a living too, right?

975
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:04,830
But I can't bring myself

976
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:06,070
to throw him out.

977
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:10,710
Miss,

978
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,510
why don't you give me some advice?

979
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,670
Me?

980
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:15,500
Do you think

981
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,550
I should throw him out

982
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:17,750
or not?

983
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:20,030
Of course, you can't throw him out.

984
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:21,350
That's right.

985
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:22,510
Miss, you're right.

986
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:23,000
You see,

987
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:23,630
this young lady also said

988
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:24,830
that we can't just let him die.

989
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,710
You have such a kind heart, miss.

990
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:32,250
But who's going to pay for  his room?

991
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:34,070
I can waive the room fee,

992
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:34,880
but someone needs to

993
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:35,830
take care of him, right?

994
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:36,710
Well,

995
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:38,030
who's going to pay for the labor?

996
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:39,140
Who's going to pay for the medicine?

997
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:40,920
Where can we get all this money?

998
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:45,100
Miss, you don't know

999
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:46,630
where we're supposed to get all this money?

1000
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:47,990
I don't know.

1001
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:52,050
Miss, you could pay for him.

1002
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:53,790
I can see you have a kind heart.

1003
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:54,990
You were even willing to help a little beggar,

1004
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:56,670
so surely you can help him too, right?

1005
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,220
I don't have any money.

1006
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,630
Miss, you're dressed so well,

1007
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:01,600
yet you have no money?

1008
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:04,430
I really don't have any money.

1009
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:06,030
Then what about

1010
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:06,940
that young man who came with you?

1011
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:09,760
He has.

1012
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:10,970
Can he pay?

1013
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:11,920
He can!

1014
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:14,710
See? Problem solved.

1015
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:15,270
Come on, come on.

1016
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:15,990
Come with me.

1017
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:19,630
Come on, come on.

1018
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,310
It's him.

1019
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:25,070
You

1020
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:26,710
are truly lucky to have met a savior.

1021
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:28,310
Open your eyes and take a good look at her.

1022
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:29,830
Even if you die,

1023
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:31,110
you must remember this person well

1024
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:32,510
so that you can repay her in your next life.

1025
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:34,430
She's agreed to pay for your room,

1026
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:35,670
hire a doctor to prescribe medicine for you,

1027
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:36,950
and have Si take care of you!

1028
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:38,590
Is he badly injured?

1029
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:39,710
How long has he been unconscious?

1030
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:40,750
Since I brought him back,

1031
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:42,000
he's been lying here the whole time.

1032
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:43,150
I felt sorry for him,

1033
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:44,390
and that's why I brought him back.

1034
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:45,390
I don't know, but somehow,

1035
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:46,550
he's managed to hold on until now.

1036
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:47,860
He's got a strong fate

1037
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:48,690
and good fortune.

1038
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,470
How else could he have waited for you?

1039
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:56,830
He's about to wake up!

1040
00:42:57,490 --> 00:42:58,780
He's the type who knows how to repay kindness.

1041
00:42:58,810 --> 00:42:59,830
You saved his life.

1042
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:01,030
He definitely won't forget you.
