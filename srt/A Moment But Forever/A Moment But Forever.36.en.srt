[A Moment But Forever]

00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:47,310
[Episode 36]

3
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,680
You have no idea who you're up against.

4
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:05,870
Listen up,

5
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,360
the only way you're entering this door

6
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,470
is over my dead body.

7
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,680
Mei Shan, how are you holding up?

8
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:27,680
This barely counts as warm-up exercise for me.

9
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,240
You came here too early.

10
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,790
Okay. Keep it on then.

11
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,590
Let's kick this woman to hell together!

12
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,870
What a bunch of losers.

13
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,150
I'd love to see

14
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,840
how tough you can be.

15
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,000
You are just lowly mortals.

16
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,240
Want to turn the tables?

17
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,470
It'll never happen for you!

18
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,530
Don't you underestimate me!

19
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,079
Nobody can

20
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,280
tear me apart.

21
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,390
You think I'd fear you?

22
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,430
As a goddess,

23
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,430
a little setback is enough

24
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,280
to turn you into a destroyer of the world.

25
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,800
Don't you think you need more heavenly tribulations?

26
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,960
It's so unfair that you could become a goddess.

27
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,490
The Gate of Heaven kept me out

28
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,000
for four whole decades.

29
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,960
Every 49 days,

30
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,710
I had to go through a heavenly tribulation.

31
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:14,710
In total,

32
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,160
5,362 tribulations of lightning

33
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,310
befell me.

34
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,829
Today, on behalf of the heavenly realm,

35
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:20,480
I'll teach you a lesson,

36
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,800
so you'll know this:

37
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,630
trouble finds those who don't deserve what they have!

38
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,040
You're dead meat!

39
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,430
Mei Shan.

40
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:21,480
Are you okay?

41
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:23,560
Don't worry.

42
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,510
This woman

43
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,740
is not going to succeed.

44
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,870
The human body

45
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,790
is cleverly designed.

46
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:46,050
It contains the divine power of heaven and earth.

47
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,920
It is intricately beautiful.

48
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,120
It is foolish of you

49
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,290
to look down on mortals.

50
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,120
Mei Shan.

51
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,000
Today

52
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,690
marks the first day I became a god.

53
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,480
I had such a good fight.

54
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,040
I'm only wondering

55
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,360
if I'm a match for Yuanzhong.

56
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,360
You talk about doing good, but you never do.

57
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,310
You talk about morality, but you have none.

58
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,800
You talk about justice, but you renounce it.

59
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,310
That's what mortals such as yourselves do!

60
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,050
You're conniving and ungrateful hypocrites.

61
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,510
All of you should die!

62
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,430
Yuanzhong!

63
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,470
Yuanzhong!

64
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:47,920
Where is the demon?

65
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:52,100
Where is the Demon Lord?

66
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,600
The demon is dead?

67
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,510
Are you surprised?

68
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,160
I should've known it.

69
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,270
I should've known it.

70
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,440
Useless crap.

71
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:33,080
It originated from Taihe's malice.

72
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,659
No wonder it's a loser!

73
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,440
Hannv,

74
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:38,360
you don't stand a chance of winning.

75
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:39,480
Stop it now.

76
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,670
Stop? How can I stop?

77
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,390
As long as you stop fighting us,

78
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:47,910
go to the Discipline Hall with me,

79
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:49,550
and receive punishment from the five preceptors,

80
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,240
I'll plead for you.

81
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,360
You are so naive.

82
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,320
Receive punishment?

83
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,790
From whom?

84
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,600
Those five old fools in Discipline Hall?

85
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:08,210
Every day, they get on their high horse,

86
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,210
preaching and prattling.

87
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,990
What do they know about suffering?

88
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,190
You say I'm wrong.

89
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:16,620
Then what about him?

90
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,670
He also wants to destroy the world.

91
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,320
Is he any different than me?

92
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,030
Yuanzhong once lost his way,

93
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,390
but he came to his senses in time,

94
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,150
and barely caused damage.

95
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:28,370
By contrast,

96
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,000
because of your own vendetta,

97
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,000
you released the Demon Lord,

98
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,390
and started the war between the gods and demons,

99
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,910
which harmed every creature alive.

100
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,670
How could you compare yourself with him?

101
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,790
Nonsense.

102
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:40,870
You're only

103
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,200
defending him

104
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,320
because you like him.

105
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:46,670
I don't believe you will end his life

106
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,840
if he commits terrible crime.

107
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:50,320
I will.

108
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,670
The day I became a goddess,

109
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,670
the sun was also

110
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,790
scorching like this.

111
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:31,270
It was even hotter

112
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:33,080
than the fire burning my body.

113
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,550
Chu stood far away from me,

114
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,510
with her face buried in her hands.

115
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,080
I thought she was crying for me.

116
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:52,180
Even the closest family members are not trustworthy.

117
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,240
What's the meaning of

118
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,510
the mortal world's existence?

119
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:59,840
Hannv.

120
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:06,840
Forget it.

121
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,910
All is unfair to me.

122
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,790
A world like this

123
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,320
should cease to be.

124
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:29,670
Look!

125
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,970
She's turning Fangwai Mountain into a piece of embroidery.

126
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,030
Stop her!

127
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,150
There are other people on the mountain.

128
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,220
Guys, go rescue them.

129
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,320
Tanyin, run!

130
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:13,780
Hannv,

131
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:14,870
leave with me.

132
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,030
The clock is ticking.

133
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,240
I wish you were truly my sister.

134
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:36,200
I beg you. Please leave with me, will you?

135
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,940
[Hall of Elders]

136
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:45,320
Bravo! Bravo!

137
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:05,070
[Dengyun House]

138
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:10,120
That was a fierce battle.

139
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,910
Everything was turned upside down.

140
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,670
The sky was dark as if it was night.

141
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:18,050
The world was plagued by demons. Even mountains fell.

142
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,510
In order to kill

143
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:23,120
the Demon Lord that had nine heads and twelve wings,

144
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:26,410
countless prominent humans,

145
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,640
Youhu members,

146
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:30,040
and War Demons lost their lives.

147
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,870
There is a poem as proof.

148
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:34,600
Force troops stationed at the borders by dawn.

149
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,480
Soldiers in armor were covered by sand, waiting.

150
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,580
The drum was not beating yet.

151
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,650
Crows and eagles already arrived to celebrate.

152
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:45,510
Well said!

153
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:46,870
This is not right.

154
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,480
Didn't you previously say

155
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:49,840
the three clans fought together

156
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,630
against the demons on Fangwai Mountain?

157
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:54,240
That place is surrounded

158
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,320
by lush hills,

159
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,550
unlike the desolate border areas, isn't it?

160
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,240
-Yes!
-Right?

161
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,120
My friend,

162
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:02,750
ignore those trivialities.

163
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:06,270
You should picture the tragic scene instead.

164
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:10,100
Wasn't that war terrible?

165
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:11,960
The war went on.

166
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,120
With the joint efforts made by the three clans,

167
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:18,070
the Demon Lord was finally eliminated on Fangwai Mountain.

168
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:21,440
At that time, the leaders of the three clans

169
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,510
got over their feuds and made peace.

170
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:28,720
In front of the Demon Lord's dead body,

171
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,550
they made an oath with their blood,

172
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,870
promising that the three clans

173
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:41,030
would stay in unity,

174
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,510
help those in need, share sorrows and happiness together,

175
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:48,670
maintain the same standards of good and bad, and respect one another's sovereignty.

176
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:50,270
No invasion was allowed.

177
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:55,380
They vowed to uphold these principles forever.

178
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,240
Bravo! Bravo!

179
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,400
It is said that Goddess Wushuang

180
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,500
is actually the Mute Lady of Wu Mountain.

181
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,760
Is it true?

182
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,270
Is it true?

183
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,440
Is it true?

184
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,030
My friend, I'm just a storyteller.

185
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,880
Up till now,

186
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:13,470
it has been over one thousand years

187
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,270
since Goddess Wushuang became a goddess.

188
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:17,550
The Mute Lady of Wu Mountain's travels

189
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,310
happened more than one hundred years ago.

190
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:21,960

and human

377

admitted to Fangwai Mountain

will be given chances to study

379
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,240
the magic tricks of Youhu Clan.

380
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:50,680
-Really?
-Is it true?

381
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:51,610
Where are you going?

382
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:52,750
I'll go get more information.

383
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:53,680
I'll be back soon.

384
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,480
But the noodles...

385
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,240
-I'll go too!
-Let's go, guys.

386

Where do you want to go next?

387
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,200
Nowhere.

388
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:10,400
Over the past six months,

389
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:12,590
we've been to so many places.

390
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,110
I'm a bit tired.

393
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:22,170

394
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,030
Okay.

395
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,480
Here are your noodles.

396

This bowl is yours.

397
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,640
Thank you.

398
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,550
And this is yours.

399
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,720
Thank you.

400
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,590

[Yandu City]

402
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,720
Yuanzhong,

403
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:39,920
let's take a rest over there.

404
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:41,720
Okay.

405
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:16,350
Tanyin,

406
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,240
previously in Master Yan's Mansion,

407
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:22,100
when you took the divine bone out of yourself,

408
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,110
did it hurt?

409
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:27,200
No.

410
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,750
That's a lie.

411
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,180
When I reattached the divine hand,

412
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,040
I felt so much pain.

413
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,840
How could you not feel hurt

414
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,030
when you took a bone out of your body?

415
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,640
Though the bone is detached,

416
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,550
the marrow stays.

417
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:48,400
The divine bone

418
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,780
represents my identity as a goddess,

419
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,400
and the recognition of the heavenly way.

420
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,680
It is not

421
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,070
a real bone.

422
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:07,400
Yuanzhong,

423
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:12,640
were you

424
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,790
mad at me?

425
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,880
I spent a long time trying to wake you up

426
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,720
in your sea of consciousness,

427
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:25,000
but you didn't come to.

428
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:27,720
It was not like that.

429
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,240
As soon as I heard your voice,

430
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,920
I really wanted to respond.

431
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:34,590
But at that time,

432
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:35,890
I couldn't control myself.

433
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,480
My eyes just wouldn't open.

434
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:39,720
When I was about to disappear,

435
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,480
a green lotus popped up

436
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,550
before my eyes.

437
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,880
It blossomed and released enormous power,

438
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:49,590
which helped me wake up.

439
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,830
Green lotus?

440
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,030
That was Master.

441
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:58,070
Your master?

442
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:05,240
Master practiced the Green Lotus Swordsmanship.

443
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,720
When he traveled the mortal realm,

444
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:11,750
people called him Green Lotus Sword Immortal.

445
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:14,380
Now that I think of it,

446
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,540
back in Baitou Mountain,

447
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,460
he already knew what you would go through,

448
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,600
so he made an excuse out of the gift,

449
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,200
and gave you a hit.

450
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,000
He left some power in you

451
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:31,680
to protect you.

452
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:46,030
I'm sorry, Yuanzhong.

453
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,750
Why are you apologizing?

454
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:51,400
The Divine Left Hand

455
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,830
was created by me.

456
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,680
It brought so much

457
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,160
misery to you.

458
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,680
But it also ended the war

459
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:05,400
and saved my life.

460
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,310
If you hadn't created it,

461
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,440
I wouldn't have met you.

462
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,750
When there is a cause, there is an effect.

463
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,350
It's destiny.

464
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,830
I'm feeling sleepy.

465
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,640
I don't think I can see Curly again.

466
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,750
I was so silly.

467
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,440
Back then,

468
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,310
I shouldn't have

469
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:48,110
made those three vows.

470
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,030
But if I hadn't,

471
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,400
none of the incidents after that would've happened.

472
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:07,550
Yuanzhong,

473
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,640
I've had so much fun during these days.

474
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,680
I have had such a long life.

475
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:19,920
Actually,

476
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:23,030
I've always been doing quite well.

477
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,160
But since I met you,

478
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,790
there has been more joy in my life.

479
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,790
So,

480
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,200
just remember

481
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,880
the cheerful side of me.

482
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,480
No need to fear.

483
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,030
My departure shouldn't bother you.

484
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,720
I won't be away.

485
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:09,820
I'll always be around.

running to you in the fields,

00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,800
is yours only.

564
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,440
None of the gods would ask for it.

565
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:36,510
Even if you offer it,

566
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:38,420
we wouldn't dare to accept it.

567
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:43,140
You have inherited

568
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,070
all the power of Deity Taihe.

569
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,320
In the Heavenly Realm,

570
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:48,440
you are most likely to become

571
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,230
the next divine Primordial God.

572
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,760
Primordial God practices magic that emotions can't affect.

573
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,360
He has no desire and is purely clean.

574
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:56,440
If you get chosen by primordial power,

575
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:57,360
you will become

576
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,880
the guardian of the Six Realms.

577
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,760
By then,

578
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:02,030
not only the laws of heaven will be under your control,

579
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:04,190
but also all the gods will obey you.

580
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,190
Don't you want any of those?

581
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,320
I'm not interested.

582
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:11,010
It takes time to cultivate interest.

583
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,970
Don't you want to see Wushuang again?

584
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,280
What did you just say?

585
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:26,000
Wushuang's flesh

586
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,320
has vanished,

587
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:28,840
but her primordial spirit

588
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,110
still sticks around.

589
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:33,400
All the good deeds she did

590
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,230
as the Mute Lady of Wu Mountain

591
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:35,590
gave her a chance

592
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:38,070
of living.

593
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:39,920
Are you saying

594
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:42,280
that Wushuang is still alive?

595
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,670
It depends on

596
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,800
how you define

597
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,190
"alive."

598
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:52,510
Maybe she is a bird, a flower,

599
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:54,400
a leaf,

600
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,550
or just a breeze.

601
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,230
She could be living in the morning, and be dead by night.

602
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,880
Maybe she would stay undiscovered for a thousand years.

603
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,030
In this bustling world,

604
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:08,110
she could be like a butterfly out of her cocoon.

605
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,550
She lives or dies in the ways I said.

606
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:11,670
Are you okay with it?

607
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,190
She's still around.

608
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:56,670
Yes.

609
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:59,280
She is in this bustling world.

610
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:06,170
Your name is Ji Tanyin?

611
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,760
You have a decent job as a craftsman.

612
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:10,190
Why would you willingly

613
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:11,710
work as a handmaid in Fangwai Mountain?

614
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:12,510
I've long admired

615
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,670
the High Priest of Youhu Clan,

616
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:14,960
so I'd like to devote my life to serving him.

617
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:15,760
Can't I do that?

618
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,070
Tell me, Ji Tanyin.

619
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:19,760
Will you work as a handmaid

620
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,630
in Liujiao Palace?

621
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:23,800
♫I lament the countless ups and downs♫

622
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,280
Will you follow and wait on me?

623
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:24,920
Yes, I will.

624
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:30,920
♫The wind of fate disrupts my life♫

625
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:26,320

in this world,

627
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:28,760
I have only one mission.

628
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,190
And that is to be with you.

629
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:37,170
♫What's real? What's fake?♫

630

♫Good and evil blur together as I race through the mortal world♫

your teeth all fall out,

634

and you die of old age.

635
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:43,550
I am the person who believes in you the most.

636
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,400
I'm the one who, in your lifetime,

637
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,190
will never betray you.

♫Racing forward, scars all along the way♫

644

who looked very much like you.

645
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:01,070
Actually, we met

646
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:02,110
a long time ago

♫But I still dare to fight the stars♫

I saw your future.

654
