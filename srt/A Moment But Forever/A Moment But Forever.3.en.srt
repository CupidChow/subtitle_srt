00:01:40,729 --> 00:01:44,250
[A Moment But Forever]

2
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,160
[Episode 3]

3
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:48,479
That's right.

4
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,910
Hypocrisy, obsession,

5
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,710
ignorance, jealousy, and cruelty.

6
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:57,110
All the evils of the world

7
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:58,580
stem from these sins.

8
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:00,270
No one is free from their grasp.

9
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:02,910
Not even you.

10
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,230
Only by sealing away the divine artifacts,

11
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,910
seeking the wisdom of the heavens through mortal flesh,

12
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,150
and comprehending the Five Sins,

13
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,970
can one glimpse the path to godhood.

14
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,750
The foolish are stubborn.

15
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,180
The ignorant are clouded at heart.

16
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:30,870
Trapped in ignorance, their thoughts remain unclear.

17
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:31,990
These are sins.

18
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,030
Mortals may be ignorant,

19
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,150
may be obsessed,

20
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:36,610
may be jealous, hypocritical,

21
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:37,910
even cruel.

22
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,510
But gods may not.

23
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,230
You may not.

24
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,630
Gods may not.

25
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,190
That's right, High Priest.

26
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:43,950
You may not.

27
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:46,550
High Priest,

28
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:47,680
you can definitely become a god.

29
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,790
We all believe in you.

30
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,390
Yes.

31
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:54,700
You must become a god.

32
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,310
You must become a god.

33
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,550
You must become a god.

34
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,390
You must become a god.

35
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:01,070
You can definitely become a god.

36
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:03,990
Did he believe it?

37
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,750
He believed it.

38
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,870
He possessed great power,

39
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:08,950
but in the end,

40
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:10,190
he was merely a child.

41
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,190
With voices whispering in his ears,

42
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:13,830
how could he not believe it?

43
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:08,320
Farewell, High Priest.

44
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:10,710
Farewell, High Priest.

45
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,409
The golden hoop sealed him away.

46
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,360
For forty years, he remained imprisoned.

47
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,790
I don't understand.

48
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,030
He was your High Priest.

49
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:53,990
He led you to victory

50
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,180
against the War Demon.

51
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:56,770
Why did you treat him that way?

52
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:57,750
Because

53
00:04:59,190 --> 00:04:59,990
of fear.

54
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:01,830
Fear?

55
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:03,670
What are you afraid of?

56
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:06,070
We killed his parents and loved ones.

57
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:11,920
Long ago, our clan stumbled upon

58
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,910
the Divine Left Hand.

59
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:14,830
To find one who could wield it,

60
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,590
we tested our young warriors

61
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,790
one by one.

62
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,590
But none could control its power.

63
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:29,330
None.

64
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:33,230
Their families,

65
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,390
upon hearing the news,

66
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,680
united in protest.

67
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,880
They ascended Tianqu Peak,

68
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,909
demanding their children be returned.

69
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:40,830
Let my son go!

70
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,070
Please, have mercy!

71
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:44,510
Let my son go!

72
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,110
I beg you, elders, have mercy!

73
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,630
Let our sons go!

74
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,860
Please, release my son, Yuanzhong!

75
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,550
One spark

76
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:53,150
and war ignited.

77
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,510
Many perished that day.

78
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:02,870
In desperation,

79
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,790
we wove a lie.

80
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,390
We told him his family

81
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,920
had been slain by the War Demon.

82
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:09,950
But wars ended.

83
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,390
Lies unraveled.

84
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,070
You feared him,

85
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,500
so you wanted to destroy him.

86
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:16,350
The War Demon was gone.

87
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:18,420
The gods and demons were no more.

88
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,030
Thus, the Divine Left Hand

89
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,190
was no longer needed.

90
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,690
It was no longer necessary.

91
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:29,470
Oh no!

92
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:31,310
The power is devouring me!

93
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:40,190
I am not!

94
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:42,990
I am not!

95
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,350
I am not!

96
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:47,470
I am not!

97
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:49,870
I am not!

98
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:51,510
I am not!

99
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,390
You are.

100
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,590
You crave admiration

101
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,470
and bask in the illusion of heroism.

102
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:58,180
Yet you have no power of your own.

103
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,590
All of your strength

104
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,510
comes from the Divine Left Hand.

105
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:02,110
A power that was never yours

106
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:03,480
to begin with.

107
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,590
You relied on what was never yours,

108
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,000
gaining the highest praise

109
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,950
and glory.

110
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:09,870
But tell me,

111
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,110
does that not make you a hypocrite?

112
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,110
No, I'm not!

113
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:15,870
You are.

114
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,470
You are stubborn,

115
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,630
unyielding, and arrogant.

116
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:20,030
Whenever the world defies your will,

117
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,620
you glare and argue,

118
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,460
bound by the chains of your own desire.

119
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,750
Year by year, your ears grow deaf

120
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,150
to voices beyond your own.

121
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,150
You see yourself as the only one who is right,

122
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,710
hold no one else in esteem,

123
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,230
and trust no one but yourself.

124
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,659
But do you truly know everything?

125
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:35,870
Aren't you the one

126
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:37,190
who's obsessed?

127
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,630
Nonsense!

128
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,000
Yet to you,

129
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,470
isn't everyone else just talking nonsense?

130
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,060
You left home young,

131
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,380
spent years in the army,

132
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:46,830
and never had much schooling.

133
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:47,710
Naturally, you wouldn't understand

134
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:49,430
the ways of the world.

135
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,780
The foolish are stubborn.

136
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,790
The ignorant are clouded at heart.

137
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,550
You shut your eyes, deaf to the world,

138
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:56,790
uneducated and unskilled,

139
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,260
yet still complacent,

140
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,150
thinking you're different from others.

141
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:01,750
Isn't this stupid?

142
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,190
Isn't this ignorant?

143
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:05,710
And now you dream of becoming a god?

144
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:06,430
No...

145
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:07,390
No,

146
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,150
I don't.

147
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,260
I don't want to become a god.

148
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,870
You don't want to become a god?

149
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,430
Shut up!

150
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:14,470
Are you seeking divinity for yourself?

151
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,440
It was the Divine Left Hand that chose you,

152
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:18,630
which means the Six Realms chose you.

153
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,190
Upon your shoulders rests the fate

154
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,750
of the Youhu Clan, the mortal realm,

155
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,190
and the burden of the Six Realms.

156
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,510
This world must have a god.

157
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:27,030
You must become a god.

158
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:28,430
If you choose to give up,

159
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:30,110
it means you abandon the mortal world,

160
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,190
abandon the Six Realms.

161
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,870
How cruel of you.

162
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:34,870
Don't listen to them.

163
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:35,870
You just want to

164
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,110
be an ordinary person.

165
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,350
Who wouldn't want to be an ordinary person?

166
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:40,630
Like Tanghua,

167
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:42,150
loved by many,

168
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,260
never criticized,

169
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,470
never blamed.

170
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,430
Unlike you,

171
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:46,990
losing a hand,

172
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,390
defeating the War Demon,

173
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:49,790
yet still unable

174
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,150
to meet their expectations.

175
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,190
No.

176
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,240
You're jealous of him, aren't you?

177
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,030
Why does he get to live

178
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,020
such a life

179
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,190
while you cannot?

180
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,310
You're jealous of him, aren't you?

181
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,590
You're jealous of him, aren't you?

182
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,470
No.

183
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:01,950
No.

184
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:03,270
I'm not.

185
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:05,540
You must rid yourself of the Five Sins.

186
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,350
You must transcend the sea of worldly desires.

187
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,070
Yuanzhong!

188
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:08,870
Obsession!

189
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,750
Only by calming your mind can you walk out of here.

190
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,590
Otherwise, you will be trapped here forever.

191
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:15,110
Yuanzhong!

192
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:50,740
Ji Tanyin.

193
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,690
♫A slight ripple in my gaze♫

194
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,120
Why are you here?

195
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,830
I've long known that all living beings in this world

196
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,090
♫Who knows the warmth and cold of my fleeting life?♫

197
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:03,950
suffer in their own ways.

198
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:05,150
Why aren't you speaking?

199
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:06,750
But you...

200
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:10,810
♫If staying together is difficult, it's not worth it♫

201
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:14,180
♫I'll return what's left of my life♫

202
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,140
♫Falling into the mortal world♫

203
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:19,370
♫Wandering through the clouds and rivers♫

204
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,210
♫Being by your side is like finding the shore♫

205
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,710
♫If between oaths♫

206
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,990
♫I hold onto the longing for just one more glance♫

207
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:31,760
♫Unwilling to bid farewell for good♫

208
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,580
♫Tears grow cold in a single cup♫

209
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,770
♫Longing fades in half♫

210
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:41,170
♫Like flowers in a mirror, or the moon in the water♫

211
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:48,960
♫A thousand years of long nights, yearning from dawn to dusk♫

212
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:55,830
You embraced him.

213
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:59,780
She embraced you. Why?

214
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:02,910
I know.

215
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:04,740
She probably admires you.

216
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,430
I felt sorry for him.

217
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,980
He was deceived by them.

218
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:12,950
They told him that

219
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,030
if he abandoned his desires

220
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:14,870
and cast off the Five Sins,

221
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,110
he could attain divinity.

222
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,590
Wasn't that just a lie?

223
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,710
Must gods truly be

224
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,230
emotionless stones and tiles?

225
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,630
Must they sever all ties and abandon love?

226
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:23,070
Look,

227
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:24,470
take you, Mr. Loong, for example.

228
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,670
You're no different,

229
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:27,390
greedy for food, fond of wine,

230
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,750
cowardly, and lazy,

231
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,150
yet you became a god.

232
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:30,990
That just proves

233
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,510
they were completely wrong.

234
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,510
Just talk about him.

235
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,550
Why bring me into this?

236
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,430
What I mean is,

237
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,180
Yuanzhong was deceived.

238
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,470
Under the pretense of helping him cultivate,

239
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:41,470
they sealed him away

240
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:42,840
and imprisoned him atop Tianqu Peak

241
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,310
forty years before they let him go.

242
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:45,790
Those wicked deeds

243
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:46,870
were most likely done by them

244
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:48,420
in his name.

245
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,070
So?

246
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,510
So I think he is pitiful,

247
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:56,230
and I couldn't help but embrace him

248
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,470
to comfort him.

249
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:03,990
Tanyin,

250
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,540
I think there's something off

251
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:06,830
about you.

252
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,470
What's wrong with me?

253
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,580
We've known each other for over a thousand years, haven't we?

254
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:13,390
You are kind,

255
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:16,030
but you are not someone who is overly emotional.

256
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,270
Why is it that, this time in particular,

257
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,510
you are so concerned

258
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:19,590
about the High Priest of the Youhu Clan?

259
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,230
I asked you to investigate her before.

260
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:24,550
How did it go?

261
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,710
Her identity and background are clear,

262
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:27,750
nothing suspicious.

263
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,030
Why are you looking at me like that?

264
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:33,670
How did you investigate?

265
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,750
I asked the human official

266
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,070
who brought them here.

267
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:45,860
Where are you going?

268
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,640
I won't ask too much about your affairs.

269
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,300
But, Tanyin,

270
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:55,100
your descent to the mortal realm to search for the Divine Hand

271
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,350
is known throughout the Divine Realm.

272
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,470
Even the Preceptors of Discipline

273
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:59,350
from the Thunder Division are already aware.

274
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:03,350
Have you thought about it?

275
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:05,140
What will happen

276
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:07,310
if you fail to bring the Divine Left Hand

277
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:08,430
back to the Heavenly Realm?

278
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:12,670
Moreover, the Divine Left Hand

279
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:15,070
is of great significance to the divine race.

280
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,780
Even if, as you say,

281
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,230
that High Priest of the Youhu Clan

282
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,270
is a good person.

283
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:20,850
Compared to Taihe

284
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,080
and the Six Realms,

285
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,350
which is more important?

286
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,070
You can't compare them like that.

287
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,430
Why can't I compare them like that?

288
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,310
Ji Tanyin.

289
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,110
He's calling me.

290
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:33,310
I have to go now.

291
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:35,980
I haven't finished speaking yet.

292
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:38,230
Ji Tanyin.

293
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:43,270
High Priest.

294
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,310
Are you busy with something?

295
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:46,510
Then come with me.

296
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:02,310
High Priest,

297
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:03,950
you wield the Divine Left Hand

298
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:05,190
and bear a demigod's form.

299
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,670
Illness should never touch you.

300
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:08,750
Yet the golden hoop binds you,

301
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,550
stripping your magical power

302
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,190
and rendering you no different from a mortal,

303
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:13,660
vulnerable to exhaustion and sickness.

304
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,070
So?

305
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:16,480
So you shouldn't put it on.

306
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,130
-High Priest.
-High Priest.

307
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,460
They fear you greatly.

308
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,270
They say you are cruel,

309
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:31,150
unpredictable, and volatile in temper.

310
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:33,510
They say you live in extravagant indulgence,

311
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:34,430
lost in endless debauchery.

312
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:35,710
You are not only ruthless and lustful

313
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:37,030
but also greedy and excessive.

314
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:38,830
You drink a hundred jars of wine a day,

315
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:39,670
and at the slightest displeasure,

316
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,960
you take lives without hesitation.

317
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:42,590
A hundred jars?

318
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:45,670
That's quite a capacity.

319
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:47,950
Aren't you angry?

320
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,270
Why would I be angry?

321
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:51,590
They misunderstand you.

322
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,870
They even slander you.

323
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,230
Greed, anger, delusion, arrogance, and doubt

324
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:57,270
lead to misdeeds

325
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,510
and hinder the cultivation.

326
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:59,870
Seeking enlightenment and refining the heart

327
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,630
has always been my lesson.

328
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,020
What they say about me

329
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:05,030
has nothing to do with me.

330
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,470
Why do you care so much about me?

331
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:10,950
Zi Fei said

332
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:12,320
you admire me.

333
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,110
Admire?

334
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,380
Thinking about it carefully,

335
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:16,990
it seems like from the very beginning,

336
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:18,730
you knew who I was.

337
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:20,830
That day, at the selection for handmaidens,

338
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,270
when you saw me appear,

339
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,350
you weren't surprised in the slightest.

340
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,230
I've heard that many human women

341
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:28,230
adore Tanghua,

342
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,350
going to great lengths

343
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:32,070
to enter his Jinxia Palace.

344
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:32,950
I never thought

345
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:35,150
I'd experience this myself.

346
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,030
Don't overthink it.

347
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,310
I'm not like them.

348
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:40,830
Alright.

349
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:45,150
You're leaving just like that?

350
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,020
I haven't even finished speaking.

351
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:57,900
Give it to me.

352
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,500
I'll take it in for you.

353
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,270
No need.

354
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:12,840
Does he have to read

355
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,950
so many books every day?

356
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,670
It's part of his studies,

357
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,950
which aids in his cultivation.

358
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:18,630
Do you believe that too?

359
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:38,030
You're here.

360
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:42,060
I still have some things to write down.

361
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,390
I'll speak with you later.

362
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,710
You're from the immortal race.

363
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,690
Does reading so many books help you?

364
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:00,550
Of course.

365
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,200
Books are like medicine.

366
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,590
Reading them can dispel ignorance.

367
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,590
So ignorance is a sin too.

368
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:09,660
Is that so?

369
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:12,390
That's exactly right.

370
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:14,430
Ignorance is also a sin.

371
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:29,670
Young Master,

372
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,790
the Council of Elders has increased patrols

373
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:34,150
in the clan,

374
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:36,870
and the mountain's protective formation has been activated.

375
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:40,030
Can they really deal with the War Demon

376
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:42,150
with just those formations and guards?

377
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:43,630
The Council of Elders believes they can.

378
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,430
Young Master, look.

379
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,920
How is the clan reacting now?

380
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,770
They are in a state of panic, seeing danger in every shadow.

381
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:56,230
The Council of Elders has urgently recalled

382
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,830
all members from outside

383
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,810
and is searching everywhere for traces of the War Demon.

384
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:01,630
Anyone suspicious

385
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:03,020
is to be captured first and questioned later.

386
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,430
They've even dispatched people among humans

387
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:05,510
to gather intelligence.

388
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:06,870
In any case,

389
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,630
they're already afraid.

390
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:11,950
Are they?

391
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,350
Good. That's enough.

392
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:28,790
Where are you going?

393
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,500
Today is the day to ascend Tianqu Peak

394
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,630
for spirit refinement.

395
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:32,510
Spirit refinement?

396
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,550
This is a snack,

397
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,180
freshly delivered from Xiaoxiang Peak.

398
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,830
I'll have it when I return.

399
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:45,870
Are you feeling unwell?

400
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,550
So this is the Liujiao Palace.

401
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:20,830
It's truly magnificent.

402
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:22,950
Tanyin.

403
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,070
Why are you here?

404
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:27,710
I've joined Yaoxiang Peak

405
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:29,790
and now follow Elder Xinyao.

406
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:32,390
I came to deliver medicine to the High Priest.

407
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,350
I heard the High Priest's in poor health

408
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:37,470
and must take Elder Xinyao's refined pills

409
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,200
every month.

410
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,400
I never thought that

411
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,160
even with a demigod's body,

412
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,630
he could still fall ill.

413
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:46,510
Oh, and inside,

414
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:47,910
there's also a flask of medicinal wine.

415
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:48,750
Elder Xinyao

416
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,790
specifically instructed the High Priest

417
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,230
to drink it before bed.

418
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:52,380
It helps with sleep.

419
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,160
Then I'll be going.

420
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:08,360
You want to kill Yuanzhong?

421
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,370
This poison may be potent,

422
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,110
but it won't be enough to kill him.

423
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:20,830
The Nailed Seven Arrows Curse

424
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:21,950
is indeed a formidable

425
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:23,030
cursing technique.

426
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:23,830
But sadly,

427
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:25,700
your method is flawed.

428
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,290
So it was you who took it.

429
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,190
If not for me,

430
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:31,590
you would have been captured that day.

431
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:32,680
What do you want?

432
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:33,830
I don't want anything.

433
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,230
But

434
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:36,790
you cannot kill him.

435
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:37,990
He is an evil spirit,

436
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:40,000
cruel and bloodthirsty, enslaving entire races.

437
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:40,780
Over the years,

438
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,190
how many humans have died under the oppression

439
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:43,150
of the Youhu Clan?

440
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:44,540
They see themselves as gods,

441
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,910
treating us like ants and livestock,

442
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:46,820
to be crushed

443
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:47,910
and slaughtered at will.

444
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,470
This is a method I learned

445
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:52,550
from ancient books.

446
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:54,470
As long as I stay

447
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:55,100
within 10 miles of my enemy,

448
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,390
silently recite their name,

449
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:57,110
bind grass into a human shape,

450
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,070
and bow three times a day

451
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:59,350
for 21 consecutive days,

452
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:00,470
I can scatter their three souls

453
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:01,480
and seven spirits.

454
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:02,980
Then, I will have my revenge.

455
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:04,950
I went through so much hardship

456
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:05,910
just to get here.

457
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:06,960
If not for you,

458
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,200
I would have already succeeded.

459
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,230
I told you,

460
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:11,820
your steps are incomplete.

461
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:12,990
Even if you bow until your back breaks,

462
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:13,950
you won't succeed.

463
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:14,670
And besides,

464
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:15,710
he is not a bad person.

465
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:17,950
What you speak of has nothing to do with him.

466
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:19,030
He should not be

467
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:20,190
the target of your hatred.

468
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:21,670
I will say this one last time.

469
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,110
If this happens again,

470
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:24,510
I will not cover for you.

471
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:25,870
Now leave.

472
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:29,350
You're human too.

473
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,030
Why are you defending our enemy?

474
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:34,070
Is he really an enemy?

475
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:34,740
Yes.

476
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:37,150
He is the High Priest of the Youhu Clan.

477
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:38,430
He possesses the Divine Left Hand,

478
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:39,550
wielding a force vast enough

479
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:41,000
to upheave the heavens and shatter the earth.

480
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,910
Why do you insist on protecting him?

481
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,400
Should someone be condemned simply for having power?

482
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:03,630
What's wrong with him?

483
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,080
It's nothing.

484
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:18,670
Madam Zhi Dai.

485
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:24,790
It's so late.

486
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:25,790
Where have you been?

487
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:28,030
I was sent by Elder Xinyao

488
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:29,500
to deliver medicine to the Liujiao Palace.

489
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,750
Madam Zhi Dai, I have things to do.

490
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:33,720
I'll take my leave.

491
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:03,750
What's really going on with him?

492
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:05,630
He's still not doing well.

493
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:07,230
Stay here and watch over him.

494
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:07,870
I'll go to Yaoxiang Peak

495
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:09,070
to invite Elder Xinyao over.

496
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:12,910
High Priest.

497
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:21,590
Why is your body so cold?

498
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,270
Are you ill?

499
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:28,050
It's my studies.

500
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:30,630
Is this part of your cultivation too?

501
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:35,350
High Priest!

502
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,150
High Priest.

503
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,190
High Priest.

504
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,030
Here she comes.

505
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:09,070
He's lost too much blood, and his pulse is weak.

506
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:11,050
The Divine Left Hand is saving him now.

507
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:12,470
Elder Dingxu has changed

508
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:13,550
the spirit refinement sessions from once every ten days

509
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:14,670
to once every five days.

510
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:15,710
That's too much for his body to endure.

511
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:16,240
Why didn't you

512
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,510
tell me earlier?

513
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:18,540
Yuanzhong said

514
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:19,910
it aids his cultivation

515
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:20,880
and forbade me from informing you.

516
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:21,790
You people...

517
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,430
Quick, help him out of the medicinal bath.

518
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:40,910
The potency of the medicine is too strong.

519
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:41,830
His body is too weak

520
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:42,710
to endure it.

521
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:44,830
Go on ahead.

522
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:45,950
Boil some more hot water in the kitchen.

523
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,600
[Liujiao Palace]

524
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:23,250
Is he feeling better?

525
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:24,550
What are you doing here?

526
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,510
Elder Xinyao is inside.

527
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:26,510
He'll be fine.

528
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:29,630
What is spirit refinement?

529
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:31,190
It is part of his studies.

530
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:33,190
It is a secret technique of our clan.

531
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:34,070
I cannot tell you.

532
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:36,390
You don't have to keep watch here the whole time.

533
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,940
Dingxu has changed the spirit refinement schedule.

534
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:01,470
Why didn't you tell me?

535
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:04,230
Well, now you know, don't you?

536
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:08,230
Do you really think

537
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:10,230
this training is useful to you?

538
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:13,750
Yes.

539
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:16,750
And it is of great use.

540
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,100
Humans have five sins:

541
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,100
cruelty,

542
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:22,550
obsession,

543
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:24,510
hypocrisy,

544
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:26,030
jealousy,

545
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:27,790
and ignorance.

546
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:30,310
Only through diligent cultivation,

547
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,280
aligning knowledge with action,

548
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,710
can one rid themselves of the Five Sins

549
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:37,060
and attain divinity.

550
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:40,270
My talent and insight

551
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:42,110
are quite remarkable.

552
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,510
And with the Divine Left Hand,

553
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:48,110
I believe

554
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:50,990
I will eventually find a way

555
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,400
to comprehend the Great Way.

556
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:55,700
You...

557
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,330
Elder Xinyao, don't worry.

558
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:00,550
These are all necessary steps.

559
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:03,230
I can handle it.

560
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:08,990
Then you should rest well.

561
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,600
I'll be going now.

562
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:12,750
Take care, Elder.

563
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,150
High Priest, are you hungry?

564
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:42,110
A little.

565
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:43,430
What would you like to eat?

566
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,430
Red Oil Cloud Strings.

567
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:50,660
W-What?

568
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:55,990
It's when you soak the cloud strings in water,

569
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:58,550
drain them after a while,

570
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:01,110
then cut red peppers into thin strips,

571
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:05,630
add salt, sugar, and other seasonings,

572
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:08,950
pour hot oil over it, and stir well.

573
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:11,550
What are cloud strings?

574
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:17,640
What about Kidney Bean Immortal Soup?

575
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,270
Grain Rain Tofu?

576
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:25,700
Never mind then.

577
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:28,900
Porridge?

578
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:30,910
Is porridge okay?

579
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:34,340
Sure.

580
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:35,750
Wait for me a moment.

581
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:45,550
High Priest,

582
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:46,900
have you ever thought

583
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:48,590
that everything they told you might be a lie?

584
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,410
Doubt

585
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,070
is also a form of obsession.

586
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,730
Obsession is a sin.

587
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:31,190
How have you been settling in at the Liujiao Palace?

588
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:33,070
It's been good.

589
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:35,190
What about the High Priest?

590
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:36,550
How does he treat you?

591
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:38,430
Not bad.

592
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:43,070
Did you come to see me today

593
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:44,350
because of something?

594
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:47,750
There is indeed something.

595
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:49,230
Do you remember

596
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,950
someone was performing curses

597
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,190
at Xiaoxiang Peak before?

598
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:54,110
I even searched your room back then.

599
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:56,270
At that moment, I found nothing.

600
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:57,670
But yesterday,

601
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,340
I ran into Lyu Yao on the road.

602
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:01,950
She looked panicked and terrified.

603
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,590
So I followed her.

604
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:06,230
Guess what I found?

605
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:10,870
She said

606
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:13,210
it was you covering for her.

607
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:19,030
Over the years,

608
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,070
we have had frequent clashes

609
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:22,110
with the Youhu Clan.

610
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:24,670
The Youhu people pride themselves on their status,

611
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,290
claiming to be saviors.

612
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:27,780
Our people

613
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,290
no longer wish to continue serving them.

614
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:31,510
Some of the more radical members

615
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:32,830
have made it their goal to take down the Youhu Clan

616
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:34,570
and kill the High Priest.

617
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,310
It's not the first time

618
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,590
they've sent assassins up the mountain.

619
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,740
Clearly,

620
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,310
Lyu Yao is one of those people.

621
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:42,430
But what I'm curious about is,

622
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:44,600
who are you?

623
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:54,930
I've investigated you.

624
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:56,510
Your background is clean,

625
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:57,620
and your family is well-regarded.

626
00:31:57,910 --> 00:31:59,070
You seem like

627
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:00,630
a well-mannered young lady

628
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:01,750
who doesn't go out much.

629
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:03,390
But,

630
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:06,370
who taught you your craftsmanship?

631
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:08,870
In our human race, craftsmanship is highly esteemed.

632
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,860
Each province and county has a craft school,

633
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:13,680
and all craftsmen must be registered.

634
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:15,510
You never attended school,

635
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:16,790
nor did you apprentice.

636
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,430
So, where did

637
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:19,990
your extraordinary craftsmanship

638
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:21,270
come from?

639
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,070
Why are you smiling?

640
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,410
Madam Zhi Dai,

641
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:34,830
do you have a favor to ask of me?

642
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,750
If you're just suspicious of me,

643
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,350
you have Lyu Yao in your hands.

644
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:42,480
You could just expose me.

645
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,840
Why bother coming here to interrogate me?

646
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:56,750
What do you want?

647
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:58,190
Why don't you just say it?

648
00:32:58,750 --> 00:32:59,950
Perhaps I can help.

649
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:01,550
But if you

650
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:02,830
keep beating around the bush,

651
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:04,510
I'll lose interest in listening.

652
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:07,920
I want to ask for your help

653
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:10,580
to unlock this Two-Form Immobilizing Bracelet.

654
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:20,590
You're awake.

655
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:25,590
Are you going to Tianqu Peak again?

656
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:29,430
Don't go.

657
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:31,070
You still look weak.

658
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,590
I'm much better now.

659
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:35,040
Is it a must?

660
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:38,070
Yes, it is.

661
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:41,230
Then I'll go with you.

662
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:51,580
I was right.

663
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,620
She really has taken a liking to you.

664
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,230
Sit up here, and I'll push you.

665
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:14,750
Lying down for a few days

666
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:16,219
has left my bones all stiff.

667
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,170
How does the spirit refinement at Tianqu Peak

668
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:23,550
differ from

669
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:24,699
your usual practice?

670
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:28,170
Spirit refinement tests my willpower.

671
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:30,510
Is it difficult?

672
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:32,989
It's manageable.

673
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:34,710
But that day,

674
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:35,989
you were already unconscious

675
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:37,590
and lay in the room for three days.

676
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,070
It's part of the test;

677
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,070
hardships are inevitable.

678
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:44,630
By the way,

679
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:46,510
when you came to Fangwai Mountain,

680
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:47,870
did you pass through Baisha Bay

681
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:49,750
and try the pricky fruit there?

682
00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:51,469
What is that?

683
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:53,150
It's black in color,

684
00:34:53,489 --> 00:34:54,810
only about the size of a fingernail.

685
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:56,400
It's sour and astringent at first,

686
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:57,590
but it has a sweet aftertaste.

687
00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:58,940
It's really tasty.

688
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:04,630
What a shame, then.

689
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:11,920
High Priest,

690
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:16,110
you're late today.

691
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:17,710
I overslept.

692
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:19,370
Spirit refinement is crucial.

693
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:20,850
Elder Dingxu once emphasized

694
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,370
the importance of being punctual.

695
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,750
Wait for me here.

696
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:30,750
Can't I go in with you?

697
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:42,690
[No Trespassing] [Offenders Will Be Punished]

698
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,670
Please wait here, High Priest.

699
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:46,430
I'll go notify Elder Dingxu.

700
00:36:58,950 --> 00:36:59,780
Let me out!

701
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:00,660
Let me out!

702
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:01,780
Let me out!

703
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,600
Let me out!

704
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:06,430
Let me out!

705
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:46,750
High Priest,

706
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:49,870
sorry to keep you waiting.

707
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:52,190
What's wrong?

708
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:10,390
How's your rest been

709
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:11,870
these past few days?

710
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:14,710
It's been good.

711
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:16,670
I heard that after you went back last time,

712
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:17,380
Elder Xinyao

713
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:18,870
went to the Liujiao Palace overnight.

714
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,230
Is there something wrong with your body?

715
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:23,710
You don't look well.

716
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:26,070
Do you need to rest for a few more days?

717
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:28,620
To refine the spirit and grasp the path to enlightenment,

718
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:32,070
every fleeting day of delay is a loss to me.

719
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:37,300
Congratulations, High Priest.

720
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:38,500
It seems like your enlightenment

721
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:40,170
has deepened again.

722
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:42,700
Let's begin.

723
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:44,070
Yes.

724
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:06,510
How is it now?

725
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:09,110
Does it hurt a lot?

726
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:22,140
It's already noon.

727
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,760
When will he come out?

728
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,750
Once the spirit refinement is finished,

729
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:27,230
he'll naturally come out.

730
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:29,550
Then when will it end?

731
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:33,270
It's hard to say.

732
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:37,430
It could be two or three hours,

733
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:40,060
but it could also take a whole day and night.

734
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:41,870
How many tests does he have to go through

735
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:43,150
before he can complete the spirit refinement?

736
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,670
His body is still very weak.

737
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:49,190
I'm afraid he won't last long.

738
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:51,230
Can it end earlier?

739
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:27,510
Master, it's enough.

740
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:37,350
Let's stop here for today.

741
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:54,310
Can't believe the Essence Nourishing Pill is actually...
