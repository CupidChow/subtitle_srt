[Ningrui Pavilion]

4
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:06,470
♫I gaze into your deep eyes♫

5
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:11,200
♫For whom do you take apart the word "love"?♫

6
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:17,190
♫Turning around, it's like a dream♫

7
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:22,350
♫I have betrayed deep love♫

8
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:27,820
♫Heaving a long, helpless sigh♫

9
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:32,930
♫Time flies too rapidly♫

10
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:38,740
♫Life is like a flying bird♫

11
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:45,110
♫Joining, scattering, no way back♫

12
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,190
Stop being unreasonable.

13
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:48,950
♫Unable to get what I yearn for, I sink in sadness♫

14
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,250
I won't be nice to you if you keep messing with me.

15
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,520
You startled my horse and it broke away.

16
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,150
But you didn't even apologize.

17
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:54,340
♫When I brush past love fate is set♫

18
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,800
Tell me, don't you deserve a beating?

19
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,590
Your horse ran away on its own.

20
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,520
What does it have to do with me?

21
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,890
♫I've used up my brush and ink♫

22
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,360
I simply coughed and it was scared away.

23
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,630
Do you think it's safe to ride a horse of that kind?

24
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,370
♫I couldn't describe♫

25
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,520
Anyway, I demand compensation.

26
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:06,180
♫This lovesick path with you♫

27
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,310
This is ridiculous.

28
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,920
♫After the farewell, where are you now?♫

29
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,920
♫Who do you spend your days with?♫

30
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,020
♫Do you know I'm willing to wait for you until the end?♫

31
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,910
♫Sighing that the world is too lonely♫

32
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,050
♫They laugh at me for being foolish♫

33
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,400
You're no match for me.

34
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,750
You don't even dare to draw your sword out.

35
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:28,510
♫Longing is in my song; the people are not as before♫

36
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:25,960
Yet you have the audacity to bluff.

37
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,000
Fine, young lady,

38
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,470
if you must learn this lesson the hard way.

39
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:44,110
♫The wind is bound to miss♫

40
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:49,710
♫The thick clouds♫

41
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,240
Are you okay?

42
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:55,760
♫Fate leaves no room for regrets♫

43
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,560
You're a skillful martial fighter,

44
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,310
but not an experienced one.

45
00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:01,680
♫Fate only urges you to move forward♫

46
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:59,000
Sir, since I left Yandu,

47
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:00,680
I've met many skillful fighters,

48
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,190
but you're the first one

49
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,470
that I find respectable.

50
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:05,870
♫Can't get what I yearn for, I sink in sadness♫

51
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:06,960
How about this?

52
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,430
If you have a rematch with me,

53
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:11,290
♫When I brush past love, fate is set♫

54
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,150
that little dispute of ours will be ended.

55
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:10,910
What do you say?

56
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,520
Let's have one more match with our bare hands.

57
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,480
♫I've used up my brush and ink♫

58
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,980
♫I couldn't describe♫

59
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:22,710

♫Who do you spend your days with?♫

62

What are you looking at?

63
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:33,880
♫Do you know I'm willing to wait for you until the end?♫

64
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,270
Nothing.

65
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,630
Some memories just flooded back.

66
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,980
♫Sighing that the world is too lonely♫

67
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,680
Eat the soup now.

68
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,690
♫They laugh at me for being foolish♫

69

♫Longing is in my song; the people are not as before♫

71
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:43,750
I'm sorry.

72
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:54,890
♫People are not as they were in this lifetime♫

73
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,390
You already woke up?

74
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:09,130
Did I...

75
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,450
Did I disturb you?

76
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,150
No.

77
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,600
Tanyin just brought some

78
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,560
food and supplies to you.

79
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:19,800
She thought you were asleep,

80
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,870
so she left.

81
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,310
I'll put them there then?

82
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,750
Do you want to meet her?

83
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,920
She probably hasn't gone far.

84
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,310
I can go get her back.

85
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,040
Lift up your head.

86
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,480
I've never noticed

87
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,360
how long your hair is.

88
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,480
Why don't I tie it up for you?

89
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,120
No need.

90
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,430
Come on.

91
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,720
No need.

92
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,900
Come on!

93
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,480
You hair is so stiff.

94
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:17,870
Flyaway, too.

95
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,600
Why don't I put your hair into braids?

96
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,310
No.

97
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,680
Come on,

98
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,830
you always reject me.

99
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:26,560
Don't you see

100
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,040
how good my skills are?

101
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,310
Be honest with me.

102
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,630
Does my hairstyle look bad to you?

103
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:35,070
No braids.

104
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,070
Fine, I won't put your hair into braids.

105
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:38,950
No braids.

106
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,800
You're close with Tanyin, aren't you?

107
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,360
I saw clothes and boots

108
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,630
in the packages she sent you.

109
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,240
It means she even knows

110
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,070
your measurements.

111
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,480
She's a craftsman.

112
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:53,870
She has a keen eye.

113
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,510
She can also figure out

114
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,070
your measurements with just a glimpse at you.

115
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,070
Really?

116
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,360
That's impressive.

117
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,630
All done!

118
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,040
What do you think?

119
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,160
It seems pretty good to me.

120
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,480
It's much neater than before.

121
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:18,070
When you put some new clothes on,

122
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,040
you'll definitely look stunning.

123
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,430
Do you have a crush on Tanyin?

124
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,170
I'm a War Demon.

125
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,190
A War Demon

126
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,600
who is deprived of his magic source.

127
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,040
I lost my mother,

128
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,230
and caused my brother's death,

129
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,190
I'm homeless,

130
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,600
with my life at stake.

131
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,270
Who am I

132
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,130
to love anyone?

133
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,310
Miss Ji, Miss Ji!

134
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:12,950
Mr. Xu,

135
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,510
I told you I had something else to do.

136
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,160
Nothing is more important

137
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,310
than what I have for you here.

138
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,160
Listen,

139
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,430
just wait here for a moment.

140
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,070
Just a moment.

141
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,870
I'll bring someone to meet you.

142
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,560
Now is really late.

143
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,870
I must go.

144
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,430
Miss Ji,

145
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:28,040
why are you so stubborn?

146
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,830
I'm telling you,

147
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,190
a big shot

148
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,950
likes the Lucky Eggs you created.

149
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,960
You are so blessed.

150
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:40,360
This drawing shows how to make Lucky Eggs.

151
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:41,390
Please give it

152
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,440
to that big shot.

153
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:43,440
Tell him

154
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,630
that I thank him for appreciating my creation.

155
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,000
I have to be somewhere else now,

156
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,360
so I can't meet with him.

157
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,480
I'll be going now.

158
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:51,300
Miss J! Miss Ji!

159
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:52,130
I...

160
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,390
This...

161
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,150
Mr. Yuan,

162
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,720
waiting for your wife again, aren't you?

163
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,720
At this hour of the day,

164
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,670
I guess she's on her way back.

165
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:08,910
You'll have noodles as usual, right?

166
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,110
Yes.

167
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,550
Alright, two bowls of noodles.

168
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,080
Welcome.

169
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,840
Come on in.

170
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:16,720
What would you like to order?

171
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,510
Miss, a gentleman

172
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:22,150
asked me to give this to you.

173
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:24,030
He said this lantern

174
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,080
will lead you to him.

175
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,750
He would like a word with you.

176
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,720
Who is that gentleman?

177
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,910
Did he tell you

178
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:30,960
his name?

179
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,670
Could it be Yuanzhong?

180
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,360
Mr. Yuan,

181
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,630
it's my fault

182
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,510
for cooking the noodles too early.

183
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,670
How about this?

184
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:20,790
I'll take these away

185
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:21,910
now,

186
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,360
and bring you freshly cooked noodles

187
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,550
when your wife arrives.

188
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,320
Thank you.

189
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,030
No worries.

190
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:36,720
You stay put.

191
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,510
Miss, you arrived

192
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:13,550
sooner than I expected.

193
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,000
It's you.

194
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,320
What do you want from me?

195
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,150
Why not take a seat

196
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,080
for a nice chat with me?

197
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,910
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

198
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,080
One more!

199
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,390
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

200
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:36,670
Bravo!

201
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:39,700
Ma'am,

202
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,290
you'll look great with this on.

203
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,240
It does look good.

204
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,030
I'll take this.

205
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,870
I'd like to pick some more items as gifts.

206
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,390
You have great taste.

207
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,480
What are you doing here?

208
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,170
Beanie, are you okay?

209
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,600
This little boy looks strong and spirited.

210
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,510
What a good boy.

211
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,200
So adorable.

212
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,840
I bet he's blessed with good fortune.

213
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,480
Do you like this?

214
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,070
I have so many more of this at home.

215
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,120
Sir, why don't you bring the boy to my place

216
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,360
for a visit and a play date?

217
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,120
No need.

218
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,360
Have you seen Ji Tanyin?

219
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:52,850
[Subtle Fragrance and Lonely Shadows]

220
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,750
Why did you stop?

221
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,190
That was the end.

222
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,270
What do you think of it?

223
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,630
I don't know much about music.

224
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,030
Just tell me if it sounded good or not.

225
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,080
It was nice.

226
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,480
It sounded melancholy,

227
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,750
but joyful at the same time.

228
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,480
It was like someone spent several days and nights

229
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:14,240
creating something

230
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,720
to his satisfaction.

231
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,600
He felt exhausted

232
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,320
but meanwhile pleased.

233
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,870
You're amazing.

234
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:24,270
I've played this piece

235
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,360
for many people,

236
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,630
and received a lot of praise

237
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:28,480
and compliments.

238
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,030
However,

239
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,910
only your interpretation

240
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,720
speaks my mind.

241
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,360
Why on earth did you

242
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,390
lead me here?

243
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,150
Just to hear you play this piece?

244
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,670
Do you really not remember me?

245
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,000
Should I remember you?

246
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,790
This is truly heartbreaking.

247
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:50,720
I shouldn't have spent so many days and nights thinking about you.

248
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,510
Miss,

249
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,790
what do you think of me?

250
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:57,510
What do you mean?

251
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:58,870
How is my appearance?

252
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,150
How is my body shape?

253
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,750
Do you like

254
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,480
my demeanor and manner?

255
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,270
Mr. Fu.

256
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,910
If you keep talking nonsense like this,

257
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:08,840
I'll leave right away.

258
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,320
Highly improbable.

259
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,200
By all accounts,

260
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:16,070
I should be

261
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:18,390
the most ideal man you could imagine.

262
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,240
The High Priest of Youhu Clan

263
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,670
is not even half as good as me.

264
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,000
Why would you like him?

265
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,270
I don't know what you're talking about.

266
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:30,550
Or is the Divine Left Hand your real purpose?

267
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:33,960
Do you plan to take his hand away?

268
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,550
I can tell from his looks

269
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,390
that if he loses the Divine Left Hand,

270
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:39,910
he won't live long.

271
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:43,480
Who are you exactly?

272
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,750
Venture a guess.

273
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,000
Come on, take a guess.

274
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:51,750
Won't it be boring

275
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,360
if I just give you the answer?

276
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:02,480
High Priest, you have such a hot temper.

277
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:10,440
Miss Ji,

278
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,000
we had such a lovely chat.

279
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,550
Too bad that it was interrupted by an uninvited guest.

280
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,200
I'll talk to you next time.

281
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,240
Slow down, please!

282
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,390
Yuanzhong!

283
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,000
Have you eaten dinner yet?

284
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:40,750
I haven't.

285
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:41,750
Shall we go buy some

286
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,390
sweet cakes?

287
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,440
What about the noodles?

288
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,410
What noodles?

289
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:49,870
You want sweet cakes.

290
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,350
Fine. I'm okay with it.

291
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,120
But why

292
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,320
couldn't you tell me earlier?

293
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,670
I bought two bowls of noodles and I waited for you.

294
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:55,840
What should we do with the noodles now?

295
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,630
I...

296
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,510
At the exact time I knew you would be back,

297
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,360
I went to the restaurant, ordered two bowls of noodles,

298
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,910
and waited from day to night for you.

299
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:03,840
If I had known

300
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,840
that you wanted sweet cakes,

301
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,960
I wouldn't have gone to the trouble

302
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,120
of ordering two bowls of noodles, right?

303
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:08,240
Now the noodles are all mushy.

304
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,240
How can we eat it?

305
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,270
It's okay. I can have noodles.

306
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,510
Ji Tanyin.

307
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,080
How come I never noticed

308
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,120
what a fickle woman you are?

309
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:15,960
Didn't you

310
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,080
just ask for sweet cakes?

311
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,600
Why do you want to have noodles now?

312
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:19,720
It's too late.

313
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:20,390
Those two bowls of noodles

314
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:21,390
have already been thrown away.

315
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:22,200
They're gone.

316
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,840
Go buy sweet cakes for yourself.

317
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,870
Just buy whatever you want,

318
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,270
and eat whatever you want!

319
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:27,450
We like different food.

320
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,860
Neither of us should make a compromise.

321
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,030
But I do have a request.

322
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,870
if you didn't want to have noodles,

323
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,390
you should've let me know earlier,

324
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,670
so that I wouldn't have bothered to

325
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:37,080
order two bowls of noodles and wasted them!

326
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,240
I...

327
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:56,600
Yuanzhong,

328
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:58,360
are you asleep?

329
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,300
May I come in?

330
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,940
If you don't say anything,

331
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:12,880
I'll take it as a yes.

332
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:32,920
Yuanzhong,

333
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,590
I didn't have dinner.

334
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,260
I felt too hungry to fall asleep.

335
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,750
So,

336
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,750
I bought two bowls of noodles.

337
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:42,920
Can you get up and eat them

338
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,680
with me?

339
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,790
Are you asleep?

340
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:29,350
Today, Mr. Xu in Qiju Pavilion

341
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:31,790
said an important person

342
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,110
was impressed by my craft skills,

343
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,200
so he wanted to meet me.

344
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,030
But all I was thinking at that time

345
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,750
was that I must come back to have dinner with you.

346
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:41,830
So I declined to meet with that person.

347
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,400
Later, on my way back,

348
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:46,260
I met a child.

349
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:48,790
He gave me a lantern,

350
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,640
saying that it would

351
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,270
lead me

352
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:54,920
to a gentleman who was longing to see me.

353
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,200
I thought that was you,

354
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,880
so I went for the meeting.

355
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,310
I'm sorry.

356
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,110
I didn't know you would

357
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:23,310
wait for me for so long.

358
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:42,270
I've finished eating.

359
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,750
I should probably go.

360
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:46,000
If you feel hungry,

361
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,400
please get up and have a bite.

362
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:50,070
If you let the noodles sit here for too long,

363
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,600
they will stick together and taste bad.

364
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,000
Grand Elder, we're out of Blood Pills.

365
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,400
Maybe you'll feel better with this ginseng tea.

366
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,000
Without Blood Pills,

367
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,270
whatever I drink won't make a difference.

368
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,070
How about...

369
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:45,750
How about

370
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,030
we beg the High Priest?

371
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,590
He might agree, right?

372
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,440
Mr. Qi!

373
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,590
Isn't he Mr. Qi?

374
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,680
Mr. Qi,

375
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,590
word has it in the city

376
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:17,510
that you're preparing a new work.

377
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,310
Is it true?

378
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,200
Mr. Qi,

379
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:19,920
you said you were creating

380
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,880
a new work half a year ago.

381
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,310
We have waited

382
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,440
for so long.

383
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,030
When can we

384
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,280
feast our eyes on your new work?

385
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:25,070
Yeah!

386
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:26,680
When can we feast our eyes on it?

387
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:27,960
Mr. Qi,

388
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,310
could you tell us something

389
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:30,350
about your new work?

390
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:32,030
Yes! Please, tell us about it.

391
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:33,350
Ladies and gentlemen,

392
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,000
when my new work is ready,

393
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,880
I will certainly let you know.

394
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,110
However, for now,

395
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,030
please don't block the road.

396
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,510
After all, I don't own

397
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:43,000
the streets of Yandu City.

398
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,640
If you keep chasing

399
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:46,880
after me like this,

400
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:48,350
I'm afraid it will

401
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:49,610
bring me a bad reputation.

402
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,510
Mr. Zhao.

403
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:56,590
Thank you.

404
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:57,450
You're welcome.

405
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,680
Stop now.

406
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,720
High Priest Yuanzhong,

407
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,920
what a lovely surprise to see you here.

408
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:15,660
I was looking everywhere for you.

409
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:16,940
What do you want?

410
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,030
Let's talk inside.

411
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,240
High Priest,

412
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,590
you usually eat here, don't you?

413
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:31,200
Nobody invited you to come.

414
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,440
Sir,

415
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,720
may I take your order?

416
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:37,880
Bring me

417
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,760
all the signature dishes

418
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,110
of your restaurant.

419
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,030
I'm sorry.

420
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,310
We only serve noodles,

421
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,310
and nothing else.

422
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:45,420
Nothing else?

423
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:50,350
Then go out and buy some.

424
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,070
Go to Dengyun House.

425
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,910
They know what I like to eat.

426
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:54,780
Plus,

427
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:57,530
the bill will be paid by this gentleman.

428
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,990
That's it. Just go.

429
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:06,070
Do as I say.

430
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,280
Okay.

431
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:34,810
You didn't order the sweet and sour crispy pork for me!

432
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,270
Why are you glaring at me?

433
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:52,350
You deserve to pay for this meal.

434
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,480
I searched all the hotels,

435
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,790
but I couldn't find you.

436
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:57,400
Where are you staying?

437
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,790
Cut to the chase.

438
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,880
You know what?

439
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:04,550
A person's life

440
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,730
is like a long journey.

441
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,470
One may have an idea when his or her journey starts.

442
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,400
But on the way,

443
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,400
he or she might have a change of mind.

444
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:15,830
Nonetheless,

445
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:17,830
in any case,

446
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:20,510
the beautiful scenery remains constant.

447
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,800
You and I are just passersby on her journey.

448
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:25,220
Do you understand?

449
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,050
No, I don't.

450
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,160
From the bottom of my heart,

451
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,770
I don't think you two are suitable for each other.

452
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,250
There's no way she would be into

453
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,230
someone like you instead of me.

454
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,950
But she still fell for you.

455
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:42,840
What exactly are you trying to say?

456
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:44,550
Nothing.

457
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,560
Never mind.

458
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,400
I said that in your best interest.

459
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,670
This is the Divine Left Hand, isn't it?

460
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,400
I've heard it's quite powerful.

461
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,440
Show me what it's capable of.

462
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,960
Are you sure you want to see that?

463
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,200
Forget it.

464
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,030
Don't show me.

465
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,790
High Priest Yuanzhong,

466
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:30,640
I wish you happiness.

467
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:33,050
Me?

468
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,070
Yes.

469
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,270
You'll live a long life.

470
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,310
It's a shame I can't enjoy the food now.

471
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,110
Goodbye.

472
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,880
These medicines can improve your energy.

473
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:07,440
I also bought some snacks

474
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:09,410
for you and Xue.

475
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:10,240
Here you are.

476
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,060
Why are you doing all this?

477
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,650
I'd love to help those in need and do a good deed every day.

478
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,180
I know.

479
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:22,900
Your nature isn't essentially bad.

480
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,030
Otherwise, those

481
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:25,240
who have tried to catch you along your way

482
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,640
would have died long ago.

483
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,590
I have been deprived of my magic source,

484
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:29,870
so I couldn't beat them down.

485
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:31,790
Even though you've lost your magic source,

486
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,000
as a War Demon,

487
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,110
you would barely

488
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,680
break a sweat to kill them.

489
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,880
Some people and some things

490
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:42,110
are not as simple as they appear.

491
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:44,110
If you just enjoy being kind and generous,

492
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:46,110
then please keep your eyes open.

493
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:47,640
Otherwise,

494
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,480
you might get hurt by someone one day.

495
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,350
I don't understand what you're saying.

496
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,110
The High Priest of the Youhu Clan

497
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,510
has probably turned into a demon.

498
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:22,590
Look at the sea.

499
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,450
It's dark and gloom.

500
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,220
with raging storms and snow.

501
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:29,050
Your sea of consciousness is so dark.

502
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:31,200
It barely has any difference from

503
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,430
the inner world of us demons.

504
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,950
It's your fate to grow into a demon.

505
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,510
Join us now.

506
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:40,000
Become one with me.

507
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:42,210
Be a member of the demon clan!

508
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,720
That night,

509
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,640
I overheard the conversation

510
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,830
between them and Li Chaoyang.

511
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:47,790
Yuanzhong's eyes

512
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:49,720
are like those of a demon.

513
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:52,310
Li Chaoyang wouldn't have said those words without reason.

514
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,270
You're with Yuanzhong all the time.

515
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,030
Please do stay alert.

00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:02,100
♫If staying together is difficult, it's not worth it♫

564
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:05,340
♫I'll return what's left of my life♫

565
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,560
♫Falling into the mortal world♫

566
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:10,690
♫Wandering through the clouds and rivers♫

567
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:14,570
♫Being by your side is like finding the shore♫

568
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,190
♫The moon falls by the riverbank♫

569
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:19,370
♫The light finally dims♫

570
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:23,780
♫How can my heart be at ease?♫

571
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:21,920
What are you doing?

572
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:26,000
♫Tears grow cold in a single cup♫

573
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:28,000
♫Longing fades in half♫

574
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:32,170
♫Like flowers in a mirror, or the moon in the water♫

575
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,240
Nothing.

576
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,680
I'm just checking on Xiu.

577
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:42,910
♫The lonely guest can't sleep, destiny can't be undone; speechless♫

578
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,790
The mushrooms look fresh.

579
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,240
Leave the water till later.

580
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,920
Let the soup be cooked for longer,

581
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:01,960
so the taste can be stronger.

582
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:15,440
Where have you been today?

583
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,110
I...

584
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,340
I went to Qiju Pavilion.

585
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,750
What for?

586
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:25,550
To repair five-wheel fans.

587
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:28,400
Well...

588
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,510
Mr. Xu

589
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,600
asked me to repair them.

590
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,560
I didn't ask who told you to fix them.

591
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:40,400
You went to Qiju Pavilion

592
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,270
must be because Mr. Xu

593
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:42,400
asked you for a favor.

594
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,440
That said,

595
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:46,960
weren't those fans

596
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,270
just fixed a few days ago?

597
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:50,680
There are many five-wheel fans.

598
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:52,510
Dozens of them.

599
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,480
The repair isn't done yet.

600
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,440
Do you remember Xue?

601
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:17,070
Xue?

602
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,160
Xue from the tower ship.

603
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,550
I mean that handmaiden.

604
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:23,960
The chubby one,

605
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,680
with a lovely smile.

606
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:28,110
After she got off the tower ship,

607
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,200
she used her commission to rent a small house.

608
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,590
Now she's staying

609
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:33,000
near the entrance of Daozi Street.

610
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,880
I was wondering

611
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,830
why she wouldn't go home.

612
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,400
Maybe she just feels unpleasant

613
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,680
to live with her brother and sister-in-law.

614
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:40,960
And I...

615
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,400
I want to ask you something.

616
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,510
What is it?

617
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,150
At the end of your sea of consciousness,

618
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,440
which is the ninth layer of your dream,

619
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:04,640
what exactly does it contain?

620
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,800
You want to know that?

621
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,440
Yes, I do.

622
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:44,800
I'll tell you later.

623
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,630
Qian Lin,

624
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,630
I really don't know

625
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:35,440
where Tanyin lives.

626
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:35,920
You can keep following me,

627
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,070
but I still don't know where she lives.

628
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:38,670
I'm really worried about her.

629
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,150
What are you worried about?

630
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,510
She is with the High Priest

631
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:42,840
of Youhu Clan now.

632
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,030
The High Priest is a god.

633
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:46,510
Nobody can hurt her.

634
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,280
A god?

635
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:49,670
Who knows which he really is,

636
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:51,000
a god or a demon?

637
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,400
The weather is good.

638
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:23,150
It's time to come out and enjoy the sunshine.

639
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,330
Indeed.

640
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:26,730
There is a letter from Elder Xinyao,

641
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,610
inquiring about your condition.

642
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,920
Just tell her

643
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,590
I am all fine.

644
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:35,110
It turns out that the people

645
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,760
in Fangwai Mountain also care about Mr. Tanghua.

646
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,760
Mr. Tanghua.

647
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,110
Greetings, Young City Lord.

648
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,150
You're looking much better now.

649
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:45,230
I'm relieved.

650
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,070
Today, I specially brought

651
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:48,440
some seasonal fruits

652
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,710
to you.

653
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:51,550
These are some local specialties

654
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:52,880
of Yandu City.

655
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,070
We do have some fruits

656
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:55,920
that we usually send to Fangwai Mountain as tributes.

657
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,190
But they're not as good as the freshly picked fruits.

658
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,960
Thank you, Young City Lord.

659
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,030
Are you satisfied with the servants?

660
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,070
If you need anything or have a complaint,

661
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:05,110
please do let me know.

662
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:06,860
Thank you for being such a nice host.

663
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,190
Everything is fine here.

664
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,400
Mr. Tanghua, you came from afar.

665
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,360
It has been long since you left home.

666
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:15,190
I believe there are many affairs to

667
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:16,440
be dealt with in Fangwai Mountain.

668
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,070
It's no wonder that Immortal Elder Xinyao

669
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:20,230
often sends her regards to you.

670
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,620
Elder Xinyao is kind.

671
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,630
She cares about everyone in the clan,

672
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:25,540
not just me.

673
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:27,510
But you're still different.

674
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:28,880
You are the commander of

675
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,030
the War Division in Youhu Clan.

676
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:32,000
You hold a high ranking and strong power in the clan.

677
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:32,840
I bet

678
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:34,880
they need to ask your advice

679
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,760
about numerous affairs

680
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,190
on a daily basis.

681
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:39,400
I think I hardly handle as many

682
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,960
issues as you do, Young City Lord.

683
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:42,800
The old city lord is in seclusion now.

684
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,670
I believe you must be attending to

685
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,880
all the affairs in Yandu City right now,

686
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,880
aren't you, Young City Lord?

687
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,880
Now that I'm in this position,

688
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:51,190
I have to fulfill my duties.

689
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,510
The War Demons have reappeared.

690
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,800
Next, the War Division of Youhu Clan

691
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,360
will absolutely be busy working

692
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,230
and making plans.

693
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:01,070
It's true that your health

694
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,070
has improved,

695
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:03,320
but riding a horse back home

696
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,150
to handle affairs

697
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:06,150
must be inconvenient to you.

698
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:07,480
So a few days ago,

699
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,590
I already had my servants

700
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:10,280
prepare a cozy carriage

701
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:12,150
for your use.

702
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,760
Young City Lord, it's very considerate of you.

703
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,800
Jiuguang,

704
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,050
wash the fruits

705
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,230
brought by Young City Lord,

706
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:22,400
and get us a pot of tea.

707
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,920
I've been here for days,

708
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:25,920
yet you and I haven't had a nice talk.

709
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:27,510
That's true.

710
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,590
Young City Lord.

711
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:29,880
Mr. Tanghua,

712
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,440
it's time you took medicine.

713
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,470
As Young Mistress Zhi Dai said,

714
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:33,710
you can't drink tea before taking medicine.

715
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:34,920
Would you come back inside?

716
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,500
I nearly forgot it.

717
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:41,540
Young City Lord, I'm sorry I have to go.

718
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:44,270
No problem.

719
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:57,240
Youhu Clan

720
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,480
just won't leave us alone.

721
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,080
He can't keep spying on us for much longer.

722
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:06,030
The commander of Youhu Clan's War Division

723
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:08,480
can't stay forever in Yandu City, right?

724
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,590
The young city lord

725
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:14,790
seems to be up to something.

726
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,270
Keep an eye on him.

727
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,710
I need to know

728
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:21,550
what Zhi Yue is planning.

729
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,920
I heard that the people in Yandu City

730
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:42,530
had prepared a long time for this lantern show.

731
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:44,030
Everyone has brought out

732
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:45,760
all the pretty lanterns they have.

733
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,000
So beautiful.

734
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:49,590
Humans are always gifted

735
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:51,300
at things like this.

736
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:55,800
It didn't sound like a compliment.

737
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:57,690
But it was, genuinely.

738
00:39:58,510 --> 00:39:59,670
I do appreciate a lot of things

739
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,510
created by humans.

740
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:04,760
Sir,

741
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,800
here's a lantern for you.

742
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,030
May good fortune befall you.

743
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:07,760
Thank you.

744
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,670
Such an auspicious omen.

745
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:16,150
Just like the Lucky Eggs you created.

746
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:18,320
Here you are.

747
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:33,550
You have a beautiful smile now.

748
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:35,190
Several days ago,

749
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,430
you looked preoccupied.

750
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,630
There are much more

751
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,510
patrol guards today than before.

752
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:56,920
That's for sure.

753
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,590
This is a big event.

754
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,400
They are deployed to ward off villains.

755
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:04,760
When you traveled around

756
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,000
as the Mute Lady of Wu Mountain,

757
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:08,230
did you encounter anyone evil?

758
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,120
How do you define "evil"?

759
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:12,370
Those who are born evil, do or say evil things

760
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,400
or harbor evil thoughts

761
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:14,740
are evil.

762
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,480
Of course I did.

763
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,550
What happened then?

764
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,110
What did you do?

765
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:24,240
I would try to reason with them.

766
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:25,920
What if you couldn't get through to them?

767
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:26,880
In that case,

768
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:27,800
I would use

769
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:29,300
the Mute Lady of Wu Mountain's own way.

770
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:31,920
The Mute Lady of Wu Mountain

771
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,070
is regarded as a god by the people of the Eastern Wilderness.

772
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,400
She would help anyone.

773
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:38,130
It's hard to imagine she would have a way to deal with evil people.

774
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:42,840
A Bodhisattva lowered eyebrows and a Vajra's angry glare

775
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:44,230
both represent mercy.

776
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,920
If one knows something is evil

777
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,320
but still indulges it,

778
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:48,760
then this person is doing evil.

779
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,150
Right.

780
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,110
However,

781
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:58,000
what if an evil person is wronged?

782
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:02,100
Only what one does can define who he is.

783
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:04,670
Nobody is perfect if judged by their thoughts.

784
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,920
For those who harbor evil intentions or speak evil things,

785
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,670
we cannot ignore

786
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:09,880
how they have been wronged.

787
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,920
For those who are born evil or do evil deeds,

788
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:12,960
we should look at

789
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,480
the results of their doings.

790
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:19,210
It sounds like there are certain standards.

791
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,110
But

792
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,480
who set up those standards?

793
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,220
Can you represent fairness and justice?

794
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:28,440
No, I cannot.

795
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:31,060
But the Six Realms work by their own rules.

796
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:33,080
Humans have their own laws.

797
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:35,150
Immortals have their own rules.

798
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:37,590
If someone goes against the order and rules,

799
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:38,730
disregards all the living beings，

800
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:41,440
aims to become a demon and disturbs the harmony,

801
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:44,800
this person will be punished by heavenly laws.

802
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:47,220
As many reasons as this person may have,

803
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,510
he or she must pay a price

804
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:50,590
for what he or she has done.
