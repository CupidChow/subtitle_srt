[A Moment But Forever]

2
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,210
[Episode 14]

3
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:52,030
You're weak and lack vitality.

4
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:53,950
Soft-shelled turtles are cold in nature.

5
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:55,030
If you eat too much,

6
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,789
you'll die sooner.

7
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:59,070
No need for your concern.

8
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,510
You're not exactly young yourself.

9
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,560
Who knows which of us

10
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,030
will die first?

11
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,460
What are you looking at?

12
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:22,460
That prosthesis of yours is well-crafted.

13
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:24,390
You have keen eyes.

14
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,579
This is a gift from heaven.

15
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:33,630
What a waste.

16
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:36,350
Alright.

17
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:37,670
Hurry up and eat.

18
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,790
The food is getting cold.

19
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,910
Master, you should eat more too.

20
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:58,990
Master, please have some tea.

21
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:02,750
Is that guy the one

22
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,150
you've been looking for?

23
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,110
Yes.

24
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,430
Who is he,

25
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,470
to have the God of Craft

26
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,630
personally serve him?

27
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:11,990
He's Yuanzhong,

28
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:13,550
the High Priest of the Youhu Clan.

29
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,600
I chose to serve him of my own will.

30
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:19,310
This man's vitality is depleted,

31
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:21,920
having the look of someone with a short life span.

32
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:25,060
He's not very good with words,

33
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:27,150
and sometimes he can be quick-tempered.

34
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:29,190
But he's a good person.

35
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,540
There are certain reasons

36
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:31,910
for his poor health.

37
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,000
Master, please don't speak of him like that.

38
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:36,240
It's all because of

39
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,910
that prosthesis you made, isn't it?

40
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:44,910
You're already a god.

41
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,740
What you create is naturally extraordinary.

42
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:50,070
Is this why you descended to the mortal world?

43
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,630
Master, could you please not ask

44
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,590
such dangerous questions?

45
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:56,510
I can't answer that.

46
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:01,310
Oh, right.

47
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,180
Was it you who set up

48
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,710
the restriction on the mountain?

49
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,430
That's great.

50
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,790
Can you temporarily remove

51
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:08,910
the restriction here?

52
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:09,620
Why?

53
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,470
Because a weapon spirit of Yuanzhong

54
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,140
is sealed at the formation's core here.

55
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:14,900
To break the seal,

56
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:15,950
we must first

57
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,149
remove your restriction.

58
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,630
Why should I care about his affairs?

59
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,710
Since this reckless weapon spirit

60
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,190
dared to enter my restriction,

61
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:25,950
it won't leave easily.

62
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:29,350
You solved

63
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:30,790
the first problem?

64
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:32,950
I should solve the second one now.

65
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,470
Master, where are you

66
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:40,940
planning to go next?

67
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,110
I'm not planning...

68
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:45,590
to go anywhere.

69
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:47,350
I'm going to stay here for a few days.

70
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,750
He took my room.

71
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:53,909
So where should I sleep?

72
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:30,990
What are you doing?

73
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,190
Master is going to

74
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,230
stay here for a while.

75
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,070
So I gave him

76
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,030
my room.

77
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:37,830
It's very cold in the mountains at night.

78
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,150
How can you sleep here?

79
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:40,540
It's fine.

80
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,470
I won't sleep.

81
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:42,870
I'll meditate here all night,

82
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,630
and the night will pass quickly.

83
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:47,630
Whatever.

84
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:27,430
Why are you here?

85
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,150
The side room was taken.

86
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,680
I gave my room to Ji Tanyin.

87
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:32,670
I'll sleep here from now on.

88
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,150
Wait, Yuanzhong.

89
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:37,950
Don't you think there's something...

90
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:39,909
inappropriate between them?

91
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,790
It doesn't seem wrong to me.

92
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:42,710
What's inappropriate about them?

93
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,790
It's not that simple.

94
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,510
Ji Tanyin is clearly a sincere,

95
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,940
good girl.

96
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,590
Be careful she gets sweet-talked away

97
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:50,590
by that old man.

98
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:52,270
They are just a normal

99
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,190
master and disciple.

100
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,070
You're overthinking it.

101
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,520
So what?

102
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:56,630
Didn't that Immortal Qingsong

103
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:57,270
marry

104
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,390
his own disciple?

105
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:00,350
Yuanzhong,

106
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:02,540
I think you should...

107
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,430
Shut up and go to sleep.

108
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:07,510
You're right.

109
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:08,670
You're not worried.

110
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:09,730
So why should I be?

111
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:52,670
Miss Ji's master

112
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,320
is really quite fortunate.

113
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,310
What gives him the right to live here?

114
00:07:58,409 --> 00:07:59,550
To be precise,

115
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:00,800
this is his territory.

116
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,070
We are the ones who came later.

117
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,860
Master, did you sleep well last night?

118
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:07,820
It was alright.

119
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,230
Are you going to solve problems today?

120
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:13,680
No, I'm not.

121
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:15,150
It's rare to see you.

122
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,630
Over these years, I've accumulated

123
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,350
many unsolved problems

124
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:19,630
I'd like to ask you about.

125
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,550
You're already a god.

126
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,830
You don't need to ask me, do you?

127
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:31,310
The sea of knowledge is boundless.

128
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,559
There will always be unsolved problems.

129
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:34,669
Just like in the Mortal Realm,

130
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,150
there are many people who are no less capable

131
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,350
than those in the Divine Realm.

132
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:39,470
Like who?

133
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:41,190
Like you,

134
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:43,510
and... and Yuanzhong.

135
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:44,480
Him?

136
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:46,910
What's so good about him?

137
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,150
Well...

138
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,870
He's kind, righteous,

139
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,390
resilient,

140
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:52,910
and has a big heart.

141
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:53,990
Just because he said this house is his,

142
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:54,830
does that make it his?

143
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:55,790
Who authorized that?

144
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,070
Did he show you the deed?

145
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,310
By that logic,

146
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:58,870
the paths he's walked

147
00:08:58,870 --> 00:08:59,950
would also be his.

148
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,910
Everything is a gift from heaven.

149
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,260
We are all just travelers in this world,

150
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,710
so what difference does it make who came first?

151
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,030
I can tell

152
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,150
that he's not as strong

153
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,790
as he appears.

154
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,070
Over these years, he has endured a lot of injustice

155
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:18,540
and suffered greatly.

156
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:20,470
But even so,

157
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,150
after he was unsealed,

158
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,590
he didn't take his anger out on others.

159
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,080
A quality like that

160
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,990
is rare anywhere.

161
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:28,990
Tanyin,

162
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,030
I have a question.

163
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,150
Answer truthfully.

164
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,190
Yes, Master.

165
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,310
Do you like him?

166
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:40,870
No.

167
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:43,630
I can't like him.

168
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,190
Is it that you can't like him,

169
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:46,910
or that you don't?

170
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,830
I don't know

171
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:55,270
why you're staying by his side,

172
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:57,350
but I can guess the reason.

173
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:59,080
Although you're a god now,

174
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,670
you still have a pure heart

175
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:03,310
and haven't fully grasped the ways of the world.

176
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,270
I've lived over 1000 years in this world

177
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:09,470
and can read people pretty accurately.

178
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:12,260
In this world, some people

179
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,710
like to keep things harmonious,

180
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,620
believing that friendships should be as light as water.

181
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:17,150
But some people

182
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,470
fight to the death

183
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:19,510
to seek a clear result.

184
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:21,590
The High Priest is the kind of person who,

185
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,030
knowing there's a tiger on the mountain,

186
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,630
still heads straight toward it.

187
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:28,070
He bears a heavy burden

188
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,270
and has too many things he must do.

189
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,070
Remember,

190
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:35,030
no matter what your intentions are,

191
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,310
don't try to figure him out

192
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:37,360
with your logic.

193
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:39,550
Because you won't be able to

194
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:41,510
see through a person like him.

195
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,790
No matter what your intentions are,

196
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:52,990
don't try to figure him out

197
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:53,990
with your logic.

198
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,190
Because you won't be able to

199
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:58,390
see through a person like him.

200
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:29,030
What trick is it this time?

201
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:31,830
There are words on the door.

202
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:41,380
"Taixuan Scriptures says, 'Xuan gives birth to all things.

203
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:44,190
All returns to one, following the way of nature.'

204
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:47,910
Therefore, the system of heaven operates in an infinite, cyclical pattern."

205
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,020
What is all this nonsense?

206
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,310
It's like a heavenly book.

207
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:52,630
This is a treatise.

208
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,080
The question is over here.

209
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,710
"One should know that all things have spirits,

210
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:01,270
yet only the 'white horse' remains.

211
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,300
Or perhaps all things lack wisdom,

212
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:04,870
and only the 'white horse' possesses it."

213
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,490
This seems to refer to...

214
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,630
The old saying, "Like a white horse passing through a crevice."

215
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:11,150
It's talking about time.

216
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:12,830
I think I know

217
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,110
how to solve this problem now.

218
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,270
It also says

219
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:19,190
to wait quietly in the inner room

220
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:20,830
until the incense burns out.

221
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,720
That should be referring to this.

222
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,830
The inner room...

223
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,540
The door isn't locked.

224
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:33,380
Let's go in.

225
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,150
Wait a moment.

226
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:36,310
I'll go in alone for this one.

227
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:38,100
Why?

228
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,550
Because only one person is needed.

229
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,790
If you come in with me,

230
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:41,910
it'll ruin my plan.

231
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,350
Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses.

232
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:47,790
This isn't something you're good at.

233
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,350
Besides, this is just solving a problem.

234
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:50,350
If I can't solve it,

235
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,710
I'll naturally come back out the same way.

236
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,550
This is a restriction set by my master.

237
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,710
He won't harm me.

238
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,280
Just wait for me here,

239
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,550
and I'll be out once I'm done.

240
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:20,830
Sir,

241
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,230
I received the message

242
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:23,350
and rushed here overnight.

243
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,590
But the journey was long.

244
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:25,830
I'm sorry for keeping you waiting.

245
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:28,110
It's alright.

246
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:31,910
Thank you for your understanding, Sir.

247
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:34,710
It's rare to find such a quiet place.

248
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:36,830
It gives me a chance to think about some things.

249
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,230
Have you found the High Priest's whereabouts?

250
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:40,270
Yes, we have.

251
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:41,350
Someone saw

252
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:42,870
the High Priest heading to Baitou Mountain.

253
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,350
That's Lord Mei Shan's territory,

254
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:45,510
and he happens to be

255
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,950
a friend of the High Priest.

256
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,280
I suspect

257
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:50,470
that Baitou Mountain is likely

258
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:51,590
where the other four weapon spirits

259
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,590
are sealed.

260
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:54,950
Baitou Mountain?

261
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,150
I'll make a trip to Baitou Mountain.

262
00:14:58,350 --> 00:14:59,750
Go to Yandu and wait for me there.

263
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:01,700
Yes.

264
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,950
I didn't expect that, inside here...

265
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:28,830
Don't!

266
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:33,440
This door...

267
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:34,550
It's gone.

268
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,910
Why?

269
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,870
Because it's a door

270
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:38,470
that can only be opened

271
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:39,600
from the outside.

272
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,590
So doesn't that mean we're trapped here?

273
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,010
Not necessarily.

274
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,000
Once the incense burns out,

275
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,810
the door will reappear.

276
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:49,550
Then why are you so nervous?

277
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:50,830
It's just the time it takes for one incense stick to burn out.

278
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:52,150
I'll wait here with you.

279
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:53,830
Who asked you to accompany me?

280
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:54,830
I told you not to come in.

281
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,320
Why didn't you listen to me?

282
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,030
I've already said

283
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,380
I wouldn't be in danger

284
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:01,030
and told you not to come in.

285
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:01,550
It's just the time it takes

286
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:02,390
for one incense stick to burn out.

287
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:03,710
Why did you have to follow me in?

288
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,430
Since you said there's no danger

289
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:06,830
and it's only a short while,

290
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,350
why didn't you let me in?

291
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:10,670
Ji Tanyin,

292
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,030
you need to understand one thing—

293
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,670
I'm the one who needs to break the seal.

294
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:15,830
This is my business.

295
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:17,270
You are just

296
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:18,830
my maid.

297
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:19,940
I have no habit

298
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,790
of letting women fight my battles for me.

299
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,230
Are you still not going to tell me the truth?

300
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:30,430
Forget it.

301
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:31,470
Since you've come in,

302
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:32,670
I can't hide it from you anymore.

303
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:34,590
Look at the environment here.

304
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:37,430
The environment here is completely different from the outside world.

305
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,710
This place is called the Realm of the White Horse.

306
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:42,030
The Realm of the White Horse?

307
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:42,870
That's right.

308
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:45,310
It is an illusionary space created by the caster

309
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:47,020
using a mind technique.

310
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,360
The flow of time in this realm

311
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,350
is completely different from the outside world.

312
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,660
How is it different?

313
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:52,830
It's much slower.

314
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,030
Once, when I was in the cold...

315
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,310
I... I once encountered

316
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:01,350
a similar predicament.

317
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:02,120
Though outside,

318
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,510
only 30 minutes passed,

319
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,430
inside,

320
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:05,869
many years had already passed.

321
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:06,990
Many years?

322
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:08,260
Yes.

323
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:09,109
That's why I told you

324
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:10,150
not to come in.

325
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,589
I've already been through it,

326
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:13,069
so I know how to break out of it.

327
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,069
But there's nothing here.

328
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,270
For over a decade,

329
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,630
didn't you eat or drink anything?

330
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:18,750
Not exactly.

331
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:20,160
The constraint of emptiness

332
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,150
mainly confines the mind and spirit.

333
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:23,430
Even without food or water,

334
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:24,589
you won't feel hunger,

335
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:25,950
nor will you feel tired.

336
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,790
Actually, even breathing

337
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:28,980
is unnecessary.

338
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,030
Haven't you noticed

339
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:30,990
that there's no air

340
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:32,150
to breathe here at all?

341
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,590
Indeed.

342
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,500
That Xie is quite something.

343
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,230
My master is knowledgeable.

344
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:43,070
You're surprised because you've seen little.

345
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:45,470
Fine.

346
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:47,310
I admit that you and your master are impressive.

347
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,950
You're impressive, and he's even more so.

348
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:49,990
Satisfied now?

349
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:51,150
Since you already know

350
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:52,310
how to break it,

351
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:53,670
stop keeping it to yourself.

352
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:54,550
Please, go ahead.

353
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:02,500
What are these?

354
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:03,990
The lines must be drawn straight,

355
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,230
crisscrossed.

356
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:07,110
The sizes of the squares must be consistent.

357
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,150
I'll draw the horizontal lines, and you draw the vertical ones.

358
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:10,950
Got it?

359
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:56,230
This line isn't straight.

360
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:12,710
Is this better?

361
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:15,830
The horizontal and vertical lines are aligned, and the squares are neat.

362
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,430
That's good. Excellent.

363
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:18,750
Here, take it back.

364
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:20,430
Why are you giving it to me?

365
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:21,870
You still need to use it.

366
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:23,550
What do you mean?

367
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:25,990
I'll draw Xs, and you draw Os.

368
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,400
It's your turn.

369
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:37,510
You did all this just to play chess?

370
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:39,430
Yes.

371
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:41,550
Playing chess is the best way to pass the time.

372
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,430
Is this your way to break the formation?

373
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:05,790
What are you doing?

374
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:07,510
Checking my pulse.

375
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:08,720
Checking your pulse?

376
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,630
I'm timing it with my pulse.

377
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:14,270
What's the timing for?

378
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,740
To figure out how much time

379
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:17,910
it takes you to make this move.

380
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:22,910
This move

381
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:23,950
took you the time

382
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,710
of 21,800 heartbeats,

383
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:26,630
which means

384
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:28,750
you spent six hours on it.

385
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,070
We have plenty of time.

386
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,830
Isn't it better to play slowly?

387
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:35,910
Last time,

388
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,390
when I played chess against myself,

389
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:38,830
I often spent 10 or more days

390
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,030
on a single game.

391
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:41,310
Today, considering you,

392
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,310
I've sped it up.

393
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:46,500
Playing chess slowly is really boring.

394
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:49,350
Do you have any other ways

395
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:50,430
to pass the time?

396
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:52,870
Well...

397
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:54,840
how about drinking?

398
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:55,870
You have wine?

399
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:56,750
Yes.

400
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,190
But there's only one jar.

401
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:59,910
It was a gift from Xue when we were

402
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:01,110
on the tower ship last time.

403
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,400
Well, it's better than nothing.

404
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:04,950
Bring it out then.

405
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:12,140
There's only one cup?

406
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,470
High Priest, if you don't like it,

407
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,660
you can just drink straight from the jar.

408
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:17,870
The wine is so little.

409
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,110
We'll have to drink it slowly.

410
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:21,830
How about we play a drinking game?

411
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,670
But I don't know how to play drinking games.

412
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:26,630
It's not difficult.

413
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,630
There are countless drinking games.

414
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,470
Have you ever played "Never Have I Ever"?

415
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:31,830
What's that?

416
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:33,150
It's very simple.

417
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:34,390
You say one thing

418
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:35,710
you've never done.

419
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:36,990
If I never did it either,

420
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:38,110
then you lose.

421
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:39,070
The loser drinks.

422
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:40,110
No matter whether you win or lose,

423
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,270
the other person gets to set the next challenge.

424
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:43,310
But you need to start whatever you say

425
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:45,430
with "Never have I ever."

426
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:46,390
Got it?

427
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:48,910
It doesn't seem too difficult.

428
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:51,070
You'll get it after one round. You go first.

429
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:54,510
Well...

430
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,430
Never have I ever stolen anything.

431
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:02,550
Such a boring challenge.

432
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,150
But you won.

433
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:07,040
I won?

434
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,700
So you've stolen things?

435
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,310
What did you steal?

436
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:12,430
Many things.

437
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:15,550
When I was young, I stole my father's wine,

438
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:17,630
my teacher's exam papers,

439
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,710
and Tanghua's boots.

440
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:21,400
As I grew up, I stole even more.

441
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:23,580
I stole the fame that didn't belong to me,

442
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:25,430
power that wasn't mine,

443
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:27,470
and...

444
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,230
I stole many lives.

445
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:33,710
How much wine should I drink?

446
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:35,070
It doesn't work like that.

447
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:40,230
But I did steal Tanghua's boots.

448
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:47,420
My turn.

449
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:51,880
Never have I ever lied to a friend.

450
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:54,390
You're lying.

451
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,290
Last time,

452
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:58,190
you asked me to go to Penglai Alley in Shifang Town

453
00:22:58,190 --> 00:22:59,710
to find a Mr. Bai.

454
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,190
But there's no such place

455
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:02,390
as Penglai Alley in Shifang Town,

456
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:03,950
let alone a Mr. Bai.

457
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,310
So, are you my friend?

458
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:09,020
I think I am.

459
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,870
Then have you ever lied to me?

460
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,470
Seems like you're not so honest either.

461
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,110
Never have I ever done anything I feel guilty about.

462
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:32,790
What do you consider as something to feel guilty about?

463
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:35,030
Things that make you feel ashamed,

464
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:36,230
guilty, go against your conscience,

465
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:37,580
and self-loathing.

466
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:39,960
Well, I haven't done that either.

467
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:43,590
You really haven't.

468
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:58,350
Never have I ever

469
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:01,510
approached someone

470
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:02,870
with ill intentions.

471
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:19,430
What counts as ill intentions?

472
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,380
Does that need to be asked?

473
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:23,310
Doing evil deeds, having malicious thoughts,

474
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,220
scheming, calculating—

475
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:26,260
they all count.

476
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,590
What if such ill intentions

477
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:31,150
are considered

478
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:32,420
a kind of good for the world?

479
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,350
If it's for the benefit of the world,

480
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,340
be called an ill intention.

481
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,470
Alright.

482
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:56,740
Then this drink is yours.

483
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:00,590
Alright.

484
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,580
Never have I ever lost my true self.

485
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:09,990
What's true self?

486
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,350
Unconstrained,

487
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:13,350
free of resentment or hatred,

488
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:14,390
at ease,

489
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,310
and never swayed

490
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,510
by outside influences—

491
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:18,550
that is the true self.

492
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:24,790
Then you're really lucky.

493
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:33,550
There's not much wine left.

494
00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:00,330
Never have I ever had a crush.

495
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:07,230
What? You have?

496
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:10,070
I...

497
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,030
It's either yes or no.

498
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,430
Why are you hesitating?

499
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,990
How do you define a crush?

500
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:27,990
It's someone you care about, pay attention to, and admire.

501
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:29,350
You can't help

502
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,070
but want to care for her,

503
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,670
and you can't control the urge to see her

504
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:34,970
and be with her.

505
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:36,550
Sometimes,

506
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:38,150
you even forget who you are,

507
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:39,460
like...

508
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:41,870
like being drunk.

509
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:46,380
What? Have you experienced this?

510
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:47,350
I...

511
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:51,980
Why are you looking at me?

512
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:54,670
I don't know.

513
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,430
I can't explain it.

514
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,060
I'll just drink half a cup.

515
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,610
Why did you drink too?

516
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:19,950
I'm done playing.

517
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:21,030
Why?

518
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,120
What do you mean "why"?

519
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:23,350
I'm bored. I don't want to play anymore.

520
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:25,230
You're lying.

521
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:26,230
Who's lying?

522
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:26,990
You are.

523
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,160
You're telling a lie.

524
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,510
That's lying.

525
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,010
What's true and what's false?

526
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:32,190
Can you tell the difference?

527
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:33,740
The longer you live,

528
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:34,900
the more you understand one thing:

529
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:36,450
it's hard to tell what's true or false in this world.

530
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:37,670
Is the sky real?

531
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:38,650
Is the earth real?

532
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,310
What's real

533
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:41,680
in this space?

534
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:46,150
In this space, it seems true

535
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,590
that there's nothing real

536
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,870
except for you and me.

537
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:52,500
Are we real?

538
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:55,270
Doesn't the real us

539
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,590
need to breathe?

540
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,750
I know how to get out now.

541
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:11,230
The incense has burned out?

542
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:12,630
We've passed this challenge?

543
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,630
That's right. We're out.

544
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,430
Looks like this is the entrance

545
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:21,470
to the next challenge.

546
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:22,310
Let's go.

547
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,390
Wait.

548
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:26,790
What's really going on?

549
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:28,510
I still don't quite understand.

550
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:31,230
Haven't you figured it out yet?

551
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:33,110
Creating a space out of nothing

552
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:34,350
is beyond the ability of ordinary people.

553
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:35,790
Even if your master is incredibly formidable,

554
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:37,150
he doesn't have such an ability.

555
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:38,870
This so-called "Realm of the White Horse"

556
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:39,950
is just an illusion.

557
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:41,200
What it can trap

558
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,910
is only our consciousness.

559
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:45,990
Then why is the time inside

560
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,590
different from the time outside?

561
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:49,750
Time doesn't actually exist.

562
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:50,710
It's all an illusion.

563
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:52,670
Time doesn't exist?

564
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:55,270
Ji Tanyin, then tell me,

565
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,630
what is time?

566
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:00,590
Time, in its essence,

567
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:02,270
can be as grand as the rise and set of the sun,

568
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:03,430
the movement of the stars,

569
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,270
or as minute as the falling of incense ash or sand,

570
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:06,430
the shifting shadow of a sundial.

571
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:08,310
I've even heard that

572
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:10,210
in the Western Region, there are master craftsmen

573
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:11,470
who can create timekeeping devices

574
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:12,870
using metal gears,

575
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:15,030
precise enough to measure the tiniest movements of time

576
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:16,210
with almost no deviation.

577
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:18,870
But actually, no matter the method,

578
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,230
it's just measuring

579
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:22,110
one object's movement

580
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,670
in relation to another.

581
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:26,070
It's simply using motion to measure motion.

582
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:27,710
So, there's no such thing as time.

583
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,950
I'm even more confused now.

584
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,510
Let me put it more simply.

585
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:34,150
The essence of time

586
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:35,540
is just a consensus

587
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,110
made by all beings in the world,

588
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,230
a common agreement

589
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:39,470
for coordinated labor.

590
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:40,750
A day

591
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:42,310
can be divided into 12 periods,

592
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,750
but it can also be divided

593
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,190
into 24, 48,

594
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:46,230
or even countless ones.

595
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:47,630
As long as everyone in the world accepts it,

596
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:48,590
the number of divisions

597
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:49,750
doesn't really matter.

598
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:51,510
In fact, time has never changed.

599
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:52,510
What we can truly possess

600
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:53,870
is only one time,

601
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:55,180
and that is the present moment,

602
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,150
right here and now.

603
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:58,880
Did you come up with all of this just now?

604
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:00,230
It's not that hard to understand.

605
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:02,430
As long as you know that time is an illusion

606
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:03,870
and doesn't really exist,

607
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:05,310
then the Realm of the White Horse

608
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:07,150
is just a trick,

609
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:07,990
a form of hypnosis.

610
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:09,340
As long as you truly don't believe it in your heart,

611
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,910
why do you need to sit for 10 years doing nothing?

612
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,350
Unexpectedly, once I tried,

613
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:13,630
we got out.

614
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,480
Your comprehension is extraordinary.

615
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:19,060
It seems I've underestimated you before.

616
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:22,950
I'm serious.

617
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:23,940
I got it.

618
00:30:58,150 --> 00:30:59,110
Braised pork?

619
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:00,710
What are these?

620
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,470
These are words.

621
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:04,870
Of course I know they're words.

622
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:07,630
What are those?

623
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:10,670
Those are the ink and brush for writing.

624
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:12,570
How strange.

625
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:13,110
Don't tell me

626
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,390
that we're supposed to practice calligraphy here.

627
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:16,740
Not you. Me.

628
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:19,030
I wrote all these words.

629
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:20,870
I wrote them here years ago.

630
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:22,390
Braised pork?

631
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:23,910
It's "braised pork,"

632
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:25,070
and also a calming mantra.

633
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:28,750
It was my 10th year in the mountains.

634
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:30,020
For a whole year,

635
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:31,550
I was trapped here

636
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:32,590
by the third question,

637
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:33,950
unable to pass it.

638
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:44,510
[Teenage Ji Tanyin]
[Human Race]

639
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:44,890
I understand now.

640
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:07,830
Reach to the farthest corners in all directions,

641
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:11,870
immeasurably high, unfathomably deep.

642
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:16,090
It envelops the world, bestowing essence upon all things in an invisible manner.

643
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:20,160
It flows like a spring, rushing and gradually filling.

644
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:24,530
It churns and stirs, muddy yet slowly becoming clear.

645
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:28,420
Vertically, it extends to the entire universe;

646
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,660
horizontally, it covers everything.

647
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,600
Wrong.

648
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,030
Master,

649
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:47,380
I was frustrated by the problem.

650
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:49,450
I've embarrassed myself in front of you.

651
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:51,740
You're agitated.

652
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:53,830
How are you going to solve the problem like this?

653
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:56,350
But every time I try to focus,

654
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:59,610
I can't calm my mind.

655
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:01,750
Master, please teach me a calming mantra.

656
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:11,690
Have you been reading too many storybooks?

657
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:13,470
There's no such thing as a calming mantra in this world.

658
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:14,740
There isn't?

659
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:15,580
There isn't.

660
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,620
But actually, there is.

661
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:21,560
There is?

662
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:25,000
Hold your breath and calm your mind,

663
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:27,440
and everything in the world is a calming mantra.

664
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:29,430
When I was your age,

665
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:30,590
whenever I felt agitated,

666
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:32,510
I would copy a book called The Book of Calming

667
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,660
and I would naturally calm down.

668
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:37,550
Then I'll find a book and start copying it.

669
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,010
Silly child,

670
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:42,100
you still don't understand what I'm saying?

671
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:44,300
Then what should I do?

672
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:46,430
Please stop speaking in riddles, Master.

673
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:49,990
What do you like to eat?

674
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,600
What do I like to eat?

675
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:55,190
Braised pork.

676
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:55,830
Good!

677
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:57,610
Just copy the two words "braised pork."

678
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,420
Focus your mind on it,

679
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:00,270
and the effect of "braised pork"

680
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:01,710
will be no different

681
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,050
from that of The Book of Calming.

682
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:08,110
So,

683
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:09,270
you really copied

684
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:10,389
"braised pork" countless times?

685
00:34:10,409 --> 00:34:11,520
It really worked.

686
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:14,429
And this challenge...

687
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,270
It's on the wall.

688
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:17,790
Tear off these words,

689
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:19,030
and you'll see it.

690
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:41,179
It's really spectacular.

691
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:42,150
Back then,

692
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:44,070
my master only calculated the star chart for one domain,

693
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,510
with just a few hundred stars.

694
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:47,230
Now,

695
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,360
roughly speaking,

696
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:51,110
there are already about 1000 stars.

697
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:52,350
I didn't expect

698
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:54,030
that he really created the Star Map.

699
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:55,909
What map?

700
00:34:56,139 --> 00:34:57,110
The Star Map.

701
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:58,800
This map originated in the South Sea.

702
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:00,270
It was originally a navigation map

703
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:01,670
used by maritime vessels to determine their position.

704
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:03,630
Although there are so many stars now,

705
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:06,270
in the beginning, only a few dozen stars

706
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,230
were truly calculated,

707
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,390
with their movement patterns understood.

708
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:09,790
Only a few dozen?

709
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:11,470
What use is that?

710
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:13,440
Don't underestimate those few dozen stars.

711
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:15,750
The sea is vast and unpredictable.

712
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:16,990
If you want to determine direction

713
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:18,030
in navigation,

714
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:18,990
nothing is more accurate

715
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:20,230
than observing the stars.

716
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:21,800
It is precisely because this knowledge

717
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,830
was spread

718
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,070
that humans

719
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:25,510
could sail around the world

720
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:26,270
and transport goods

721
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:28,110
precisely between different regions,

722
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:29,830
enabling people in the south to eat ginseng

723
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:31,070
and people in the north to wear satin.

724
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,510
Eating ginseng and wearing satin?

725
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:35,550
That doesn't sound like

726
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:37,870
something ordinary people would do.

727
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:39,110
I know my master

728
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:40,790
has been wanting to perfect the Star Map since his early years,

729
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,590
but I thought 100 stars

730
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:43,800
would be his limit.

731
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,590
I never expected that

732
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:45,670
over so many years,

733
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:46,830
he never gave up

734
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,060
and has expanded the Star Map to a thousand stars.

735
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:51,840
If this map is widely spread,

736
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,750
there will be no more boundaries in the world.

737
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:56,710
From a hundred to a thousand?

738
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:58,310
Does that mean the difficulty of solving this problem now

739
00:35:58,310 --> 00:35:59,320
is 10 times greater

740
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,310
than it was for you back then?

741
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,470
It's not just 10 times.

742
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:02,670
For every additional 100 stars,

743
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,830
the difficulty of solving it

744
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:05,870
increases by dozens of times.

745
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,220
I'm afraid

746
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:08,390
that this problem can only be solved

747
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:09,820
by someone who has navigated through the starry river,

748
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:11,710
familiar with the position of each star

749
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:12,790
in every domain.

750
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:13,950
But where can we find

751
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:15,190
such a person now?

752
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:19,830
Ji Tanyin...

753
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:49,070
I got it.

754
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:52,350
Star Map contains four variations.

755
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:53,470
Each variation ultimately

756
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:55,470
leads to a digit.

757
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:56,950
So, in the end,

758
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:58,150
the answer we need to get

759
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:59,190
is a four-digit number.

760
00:36:59,190 --> 00:36:59,950
Correct.

761
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:01,350
Look at that door.

762
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:06,320
I see.

763
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:19,740
When you introduced it earlier,

764
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:21,030
I thought it would be much more difficult.

765
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,550
I thought I'd be trapped for another 10 years.

766
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:23,630
It is difficult.

767
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:25,150
I don't know why my master

768
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:25,910
set

769
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:26,910
such a hard problem.

770
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,230
If it were someone else,

771
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:29,470
10 years

772
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:30,910
might not be enough for them to solve it.

773
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:33,150
Got it.

774
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:34,710
You're really impressive.

775
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:35,510
Of course,

776
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:36,750
there are things I don't understand either.

777
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:38,100
For example,

778
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,350
why are these four digits

779
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:41,750
arranged in this particular order?

780
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:43,430
No matter how I try,

781
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:45,110
I can't figure out the meaning behind it.

782
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:47,620
If you can't figure it out, then don't.

783
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:49,270
We've passed it anyway. Let's move on to the next one.

784
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:09,600
I know this thing.

785
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:12,430
What is it called? Some kind of house?

786
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:13,590
Linglong House.

787
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:15,150
Right, Linglong House.

788
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:17,030
You're familiar with it?

789
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:20,990
Spatial craftsmanship

790
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:22,150
is a mandatory course

791
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:23,100
for students on Yingong Mountain.

792
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,190
Your master knows it too?

793
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,550
And he teaches you that?

794
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:29,830
Why is what I heard different from this?

795
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:32,750
What did you hear?

796
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:34,390
I heard that Linglong House

797
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:35,880
is the finest craftsmanship in the Mortal Realm.

798
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:37,620
Goddess Wushuang became divine precisely because

799
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:39,630
she created the method to build this

800
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:41,390
and attained immortality through her craftsmanship.

801
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:43,150
Although many people in later generations have tried to replicate it,

802
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:44,590
they have never been able to replicate

803
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:45,540
the true Linglong House's ability

804
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:46,590
to shrink

805
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:48,180
and stretch freely

806
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,150
and its mysterious transformations.

807
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:51,230
You know quite a lot.

808
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:55,220
Can this one change size?

809
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:58,150
It's indeed just a replica.

810
00:38:58,270 --> 00:38:59,830
It seems that spatial craftsmanship

811
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:00,990
is quite difficult.

812
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:06,150
The bag of yours that can store anything

813
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:08,150
seems to work on the same principle.

814
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:10,150
They're two completely different things.

815
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,110
This is clearly a workshop,

816
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,590
and there's a replica here.

817
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:18,710
It couldn't be that

818
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:20,350
we need to build a Linglong House in this challenge, could it?

819
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:21,710
It seems so.

820
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:24,350
Don't tell me you can do it too.

821
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:27,020
Let's give it a try.

822
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:28,950
What if we succeed?

823
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:30,870
You can really make it?

824
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:32,230
Why not?

825
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:33,950
It was a lost art 1000 years ago.

826
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:34,910
But now,

827
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:36,310
isn't it just an ordinary skill?

828
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:37,790
Is that so?

829
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:43,550
For example,

830
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:44,760
why are these four digits

831
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,150
arranged in this particular order?

832
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:50,150
When I was your age,

833
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:51,270
whenever I felt agitated,

834
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:53,190
I would copy a book called The Book of Calming

835
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:55,320
and I would naturally calm down.

836
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:56,990
The Book of Calming?

837
00:39:58,990 --> 00:39:59,700
What's that smell?

838
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,020
Why is it so bad?

839
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:02,070
What?

840
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:04,670
I'm saying your chess move stinks.

841
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:05,790
You made a move here.

842
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:06,510
Doesn't that mean this entire area

843
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:07,470
is mine now?

844
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:10,830
I didn't see it. Let's me take a step back.

845
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:11,830
Why are you taking a step back again?

846
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:12,790
How many steps are you going to take back?

847
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:14,350
Well, I didn't see it, did I?

848
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:16,470
Fine, take it back then.

849
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:17,950
Playing chess with you is so boring.

850
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:18,950
Just wait until Kai Shan

851
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:19,710
comes out.

852
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:21,070
You want to play with him?

853
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:23,070
By then, I won't play.

854
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:24,070
I'll just watch you two play.

855
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:24,870
With the way you're constantly taking steps back,

856
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:26,150
he'll chop you in half.

857
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:27,150
If you knew you couldn't make it,

858
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:28,830
why did you make such a boast?

859
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:29,900
Who says I can't make it?

860
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:31,650
They're back.

861
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:35,270
Why didn't you just break the formation earlier?

862
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:37,650
I'm tired. I want to take a rest.

863
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:38,590
Please be quiet now.

864
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,850
The Book of Calming...

865
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:42,430
Four-digit number...

866
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:44,350
Linglong House?

867
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:54,190
What's wrong with her?

868
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:55,990
Where's Kai Shan?

869
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:58,430
Why haven't you gone to sleep yet?

870
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:00,870
We're worried about Kai Shan,

871
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:02,150
so we can't sleep.

872
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:03,870
What about you? How's it going?

873
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:04,630
Not bad.

874
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:06,190
We passed three challenges in a row,

875
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,470
and only the final one is left.

876
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:27,630
It's not here either.

877
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:29,870
Could it be somewhere else?

878
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:35,940
What are you looking for?

879
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:37,310
A book.

880
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:38,790
Do you need my help?

881
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:39,550
No, thanks.

882
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:48,470
That's the situation.

883
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:49,830
In the final challenge,

884
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:51,180
if I'm not mistaken,

885
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:52,860
we have to build a Linglong House.

886
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:55,040
Interesting.

887
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:57,710
It really is brilliant.

888
00:41:58,070 --> 00:41:59,100
The Realm of the White Horse,

889
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,060
the Star Map—

890
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:01,590
each seal

891
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:02,870
is a profound subject.

892
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:03,750
And in the end,

893
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:05,430
you even need to build a Linglong House.

894
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:07,550
My goodness.

895
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:09,630
This old guy really is something.

896
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:12,030
Well, if that's the case,

897
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:13,110
losing to him

898
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:14,350
wasn't so shameful to me after all.

899
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:16,220
You don't say.

900
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:17,870
Kai Shan really knows how to find a good spot.

901
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:21,630
It's almost dawn. Let's eat something.

902
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:22,790
I'm hungry too.

903
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:26,510
Is Ji Tanyin

904
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:27,590
still looking for something?

905
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:29,830
She's searched the entire mountain,

906
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:31,310
not leaving any room unchecked.

907
00:42:31,350 --> 00:42:32,910
Looks like she's searching for a book.

908
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:34,030
But she didn't answer when I asked her what book she was looking for.

909
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:35,470
She's gone out now.
