[A Moment But Forever]

00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:47,080
[Episode 17]

3
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,509
He's the type who knows how to repay kindness.

4
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,430
You saved his life.

5
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:51,789
He definitely won't forget you.

6
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,910
Come on, speak.

7
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,400
What are your names?

8
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,280
Where are you from?

9
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,400
What do you do for a living?

10
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,120
We come from Pingzhou.

11
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:29,840
My name is Yuan Zhong.

12
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:30,960
The "yuan" means "treasure."

13
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,310
My name is Kai Shan.

14
00:02:32,329 --> 00:02:33,230
Zi Fei.

15
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,030
We have some modest wealth at home.

16
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,310
We do some business.

17
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,150
So, you lot

18
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,840
came here to do business?

19
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,460
Why are you looking at me?

20
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,910
Answer me!

21
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,310
Besides coming here for business,

22
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,400
we're also looking for an old friend.

23
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,590
Old friend?

24
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,000
What's this old friend's name?

25
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,280
Have you found them?

26
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:56,870
Lu Chen.

27
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,910
You know Lu Chen?

28
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,680
I don't know him.

29
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,310
Then why did you gasp?

30
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,470
I gasped?

31
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,690
Which "Lu" is it?

32
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,030
"Lu" meaning "deer."

33
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,680
I haven't heard of that one.

34
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,870
In this town,

35
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,550
there's no family with the surname Lu.

36
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,750
You don't know Lu Chen,

37
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,030
but surely you recognize us?

38
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,190
Do you recall anything?

39
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,120
Let me tell you something.

40
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,590
Trying to get familiar won't work.

41
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,000
Coming to this town,

42
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,400
you must abide by the law

43
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,360
and follow the rules.

44
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,400
Recently,

45
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,870
several children have gone missing.

46
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:51,840
If I find out

47
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,400
that you guys are involved,

48
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,910
I won't go easy on you.

49
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,930
Did you hear me?

50
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,620
That's more like it.

51
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,360
Alright, let's leave it at that for now.

52
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,120
San.

53
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,480
Jiu.

54
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:16,470
Where's Yunniang?

55
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,510
She's in the backyard.

56
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,240
If I went to see her now,

57
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,600
would it be inconvenient?

58
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:25,950
Jiu,

59
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,970
there's a stove in the kitchen

60
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,880
that's not working well.

61
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,630
Would you mind

62
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,660
helping to fix it?

63
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,750
You should have told me earlier!

64
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,190
I'm good at fixing stoves.

65
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:35,450
Let's go, let's go.

66
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,159
Go investigate

67
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:42,040
Pei Jiu's background.

68
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,240
Then we'll make our plans.

69
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,480
Alright.

70
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,870
Don't worry about the money.

71
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,630
Yuanzhong

72
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:54,120
won't stand by and do nothing.

73
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,240
With your word,

74
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,190
I can rest assured.

75
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:56,920
Yunniang!

76
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:00,950
What are you doing here?

77
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,040
San said the kitchen stove is broken.

78
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,040
I'm here to fix it.

79
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,720
San.

80
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,750
Landlady, Jiu.

81
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,070
I didn't know you had this skill.

82
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:17,420
It's just fixing a stove. How hard can it be?

83
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,390
Then go fix it.

84
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,680
Why are you looking for me?

85
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,800
Take a look.

86
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,190
Do you like it?

87
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:33,750
It's alright, I guess.

88
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,190
When will you marry me?

89
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:38,850
I've been preparing all this time.

90
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,110
Have you changed your mind

91
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,140
and don't want to marry me anymore?

92
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,310
Of course not.

93
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,310
I've been working hard to save money.

94
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,270
I plan to

95
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:47,680
renovate the house beautifully,

96
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,430
and then bring you home as my bride.

97
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,590
With your meager constable's salary,

98
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:52,780
how long will I have to wait?

99
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,260
Soon, very soon.

100
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,800
This is Miss Ji,

101
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,680
a guest at my inn.

102
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,630
She's very kind-hearted.

103
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,220
Are they the outsiders?

104
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:10,410
Of course.

105
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,120
If they weren't outsiders,

106
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,160
why would they be staying at my place?

107
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,630
The town hasn't been peaceful lately.

108
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:15,510
Near the old temple,

109
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,120
several young beggars have gone missing.

110
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,510
I hope it's not their doing.

111
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,680
Look at how they're dressed,

112
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,680
so elegant and refined.

113
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,040
What would they want with little beggars?

114
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,680
Those kids

115
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,360
fish in the east village one day

116
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,390
and beg in the west village the next.

117
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,950
Who knows if they haven't just run off on their own?

118
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,750
We should still be cautious.

119
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,160
Alright, alright, alright.

120
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,510
Miss Ji,

121
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:33,720
I'll take you to the pharmacy.

122
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,560
I need to find a chance to investigate them.

123
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,360
What's all this?

124
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,270
This is from the butcher shop.

125
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,360
This is from the pharmacy.

126
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:58,680
This one is from the inn.

127
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,510
What I'm asking is

128
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,000
why do you have so many IOUs?

129
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,430
In the inn,

130
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,270
there's a young man who was severely injured

131
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,560
and is unconscious.

132
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,680
He has no money.

133
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,600
The landlady initially

134
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,310
took him in due to kindness,

135
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:12,830
but now,

136
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,310
she has run out of money too.

137
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,070
So, she had no choice

138
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,600
but to turn him out.

139
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,070
I thought

140
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,560
he was really pitiful.

141
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,070
So I wanted to help him.

142
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,630
The landlady is kind-hearted,

143
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:26,800
and so are you.

144
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,680
I can understand all of this.

145
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,070
But why do I have to pay?

146
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,680
If you pay, you'll be kind-hearted too.

147
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,800
I don't want to be kind-hearted.

148
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,510
Get out.

149
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,390
Yuanzhong,

150
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,720
saving a life is better than building a seven-story pagoda.

151
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,430
Get out.

152
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,390
Wait.

153
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,159
Take these with you.

154
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:54,430
What?

155
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm your handmaiden.

156
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,480
Shouldn't you pay me wages?

157
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,600
See if these are enough.

158
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:04,920
Enough, enough, enough.

159
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,310
Actually, we don't need this much.

160
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:09,340
How about I keep the rest here?

161
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,950
I promise to use the best medicine for him.

162
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,680
Alright, saving him is the priority.

163
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,430
Pei Jiu probably came to town

164
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,480
about 10 years ago.

165
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,070
He seemed to be severely injured.

166
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,040
He collapsed on the road at that time.

167
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,430
The old constable rescued him.

168
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,510
When he woke up, he had amnesia.

169
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,600
The old constable felt sorry for him

170
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,630
and adopted him

171
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,800
until three years ago,

172
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:29,950
when old constable Pei passed away.

173
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,680
He took over the old constable's position

174
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,100
and became the constable of this town.

175
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,750
Perhaps while he was under the seal,

176
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:37,200
he sensed some threat.

177
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,720
That's why he forcibly broke through the seal.

178
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,960
The places where Kai Shan and others were sealed

179
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,960
were very hidden.

180
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:44,720
Who could have discovered him

181
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,080
and posed a threat to him?

182
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,510
It seems we need to wake him up

183
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,670
to know the inside story.

184
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,840
But...

185
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,270
What's wrong?

186
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,840
There's a rumor in town

187
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:01,000
that Pei Jiu is going to marry

188
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,150
the landlady of this inn.

189
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,360
He's going to marry her?

190
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,080
It's said that

191
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,670
this landlady is a widow.

192
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,960
This is Lu Chen.

193
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,840
He's now Pei Jiu.

194
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,240
Do you have any way

195
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,360
to restore him?

196
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,080
He must have

197
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,200
injured the meridians in his head

198
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:21,900
when he broke through the seal.

199
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,720
If I use the power of the Divine Hand

200
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,320
to help clear his meridians,

201
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,910
perhaps I can restore him.

202
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,080
It's good if he can be restored.

203
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,910
Fortunately, we brought abundant money

204
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,550
so we can stay here comfortably.

205
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,550
Now,

206
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,960
it may not be as abundant as before.

207
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,000
Why?

208
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:40,840
It seems that

209
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,320
10 years ago, Lu Chen encountered

210
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,360
an unexpected situation while sealed.

211
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:45,630
He had no choice but to

212
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,000
forcibly break through the seal,

213
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,390
thus damaging his essence

214
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:50,000
and forgetting his past.

215
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,510
To restore him,

216
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,360
I need to use the power of the Divine Hand

217
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,940
to help guide the spiritual energy within him.

218
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,000
But it also requires his cooperation.

219
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,720
However, he doesn't recognize us now.

220
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,230
It'll take some effort

221
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,630
to make him listen to us.

222
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:02,720
So,

223
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,200
I need you to go and investigate.

224
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,520
I understand.

225
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:11,600
What is he doing?

226
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,080
He's getting dressed.

227
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,510
It seems he's about to go out.

228
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:15,670
He's not dressed?

229
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,000
He has pants on.

230
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:20,440
Did she spy on you

231
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,670
like this before?

232
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:23,830
Were you wearing pants at that time?

233
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,680
Shut up.

234
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,510
He's running fast.

235
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,200
It looks like he's going...

236
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,550
Where is he going?

237
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,150
He's downstairs.

238
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,790
He's entered our courtyard.

239
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:09,720
Miss Ji,

240
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,150
your method is really good.

241
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,440
After wiping with vinegar,

242
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,750
this cup is much cleaner.

243
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,360
No need to put in so much effort anymore

244
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,960
to wash the tea stains at the bottom.

245
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,720
That wasn't my idea.

246
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,000
I've been reading a book recently

247
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,030
called "The Book of Hundred Skills."

248
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,600
It's all written in there.

249
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,960
Come with me for a moment.

250
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,160
Stop right there!

251
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,120
Why are you running?

252
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,360
Let me go!

253
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:05,600
Where are Er and Qiuqiu?

254
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,510
Have you seen them?

255
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,720
I haven't seen them.

256
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,550
Do you know where they went?

257
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,000
We originally agreed

258
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,790
to go to the market in Siping Village together...

259
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:19,840
To steal from there.

260
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:21,240
But I've been waiting here

261
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,720
for two days.

262
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,600
They haven't been back for two days.

263
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,060
Oh no.

264
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:27,480
I'm afraid something's happened.

265
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,030
What are you doing here?

266
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,480
I have something to discuss with you.

267
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,790
Is that so?

268
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,790
Just arrived?

269
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:43,840
What else?

270
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,670
We really came here to find you.

271
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,240
The town has had unrest lately.

272
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,670
You outsiders

273
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:52,960
better not wander around.

274
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,080
It wouldn't look good if there were any misunderstandings.

275
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:57,870
Oh, right.

276
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,790
You said you were looking for me earlier.

277
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:00,720
What's the matter?

278
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,240
I see you have good potential.

279
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:03,870
I want to take you as my disciple

280
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,270
to teach you martial arts.

281
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,320
What kind of new scam is this?

282
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,600
With your scrawny build,

283
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,600
taking me as your disciple?

284
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,600
I got it.

285
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:19,440
Are you planning

286
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,230
to have me beat you up

287
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,560
and then report me to the authorities

288
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:22,440
to extort money from me?

289
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:25,920
Constable Pei.

290
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:26,840
I'm very busy.

291
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:27,980
I don't have time to deal with you.

292
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:31,640
You've got some skills.

293
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,190
You're getting serious with me?

294
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,180
Your physique is good.

295
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,480
Your strength is decent too.

296
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,400
But unfortunately, your speed is lacking.

297
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:57,720
Your breathing is unstable.

298
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,240
Your burst power is also insufficient.

299
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,480
You've suffered a severe injury before,

300
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,480
causing blockage in your meridians,

301
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,110
preventing smooth circulation of qi.

302
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,610
Even with my injury, I can still beat you.

303
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,480
Are you sure you can beat me?

304
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:30,960
Absolutely.

305
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:34,870
What do you think?

306
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,390
Do you want to become my disciple?

307
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,350
I'd rather bow to your grandmother.

308
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,030
Alright, stop fighting.

309
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,270
You can't beat him.

310
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:47,480
Be careful!

311
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,080
Give up.

312
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,630
You're no match for him.

313
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:53,550
Just become his disciple.

314
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,440
I see you have great potential.

315
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:58,320
That's why I'm kindly giving you guidance.

316
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,630
I can heal your injury,

317
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,480
unblock your clogged meridians,

318
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:04,550
and make your qi circulation even better than now.

319
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,240
So, what do you say?

320
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,750
Do you want to become my disciple?

321
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:16,550
Why did he leave?

322
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,630
He seems to be angry.

323
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,320
Mr. Yuan, Miss Ji,

324
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,670
you went out in such strong sunlight?

325
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,440
Madam,

326
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,200
could you please bring some water

327
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,150
to our room upstairs later?

328
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:30,030
The sun is really scorching.

329
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:30,840
Thank you.

330
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:31,670
Miss Ji, wait a moment.

331
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:32,270
Don't go.

332
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,630
You can drink water downstairs.

333
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:34,550
I'm about to offer incense.

334
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:35,220
Since you're here,

335
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,170
why don't you join me?

336
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:37,910
I won't pray.

337
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,240
T-This isn't convenient for me.

338
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:43,120
What's inconvenient about it?

339
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,270
You believe in a different god?

340
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,180
Well, it's not really because of that.

341
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,960
Then what's the problem?

342
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,120
When you enter a temple, you must burn incense.

343
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,200
When you encounter a god, you must pray.

344
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,630
This is how you ensure everything goes smoothly.

345
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,360
But the Mute Lady of Wu Mountain

346
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,720
isn't a god, right?

347
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,910
How is she not a god?

348
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,360
Wherever the Mute Goddess passes,

349
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,240
deserts turn into oases,

350
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,320
and sandy lands become fertile fields.

351
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,360
With a mere touch from her,

352
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,440
even the most mischievous and clumsy children

353
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,240
can read and write,

354
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,080
becoming clever and quick-witted.

355
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,200
If this doesn't count as divine, what does?

356
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,320
Is there a possibility that

357
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,080
after the Mute Lady of Wu Mountain

358
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,240
arrived here,

359
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,510
she discovered it was arid,

360
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,870
so she taught people to dig wells?

361
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:11,910
She saw the barrenness here,

362
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,150
so she taught people to farm?

363
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,030
When she saw children

364
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,320
with no schools to learn in,

365
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,580
she taught them to read?

366
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:18,080
There was no miraculous transformation

367
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,670
of barren land into oases or enlightenment by touch.

368
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,600
There is indeed such a legend.

369
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,030
I once heard from the elders

370
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,750
that the Mute Goddess was just an ordinary person.

371
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:27,440
She was kind-hearted and knowledgeable,

372
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,840
willing to teach children to read and write,

373
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,360
and led everyone in farming,

374
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,270
so that the hungry could have food to eat.

375
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,150
Yes,

376
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,790
she was just an ordinary person after all.

377
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,270
How can she be considered ordinary?

378
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,790
Does one have to fight and kill

379
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,070
or have superpowers to be called a god?

380
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,910
The Mute Goddess spread knowledge and education,

381
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:42,550
saving countless lives,

382
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,750
accumulating such great merit.

383
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,910
How can she not be considered divine?

384
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,670
People like her,

385
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:46,960
even if they weren't gods before,

386
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,000
would surely ascend after death,

387
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,960
becoming an immortal.

388
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,600
We people of the Eastern Wilderness

389
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,600
don't care about those details.

390
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:53,440
Rather than believing in those

391
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,670
who can shatter a mountain with one palm,

392
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,600
or the murderous gods who can destroy a city with one punch,

393
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,410
we only believe in the gods who are good to us.

394
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,000
The Mute Goddess of Wu Mountain saves all living beings

395
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,030
with great compassion and mercy.

396
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,960
She has always been blessing us.

397
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:05,750
I, Yunniang, offer incense to the Goddess,

398
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:06,880
asking for her protection.

399
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,510
May wealth flow in abundance and livestock be safe and sound.

400
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:09,720
Mainly for the wealth to flow in abundance.

401
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:29,830
Yuan…

402
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,400
You lost the fight.

403
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,510
Not satisfied, are you?

404
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:53,240
if you're not satisfied, we can fight some more.

405
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,590
You're the best, okay?

406
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:59,560
You just want to be praised, don't you?

407
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,030
Is it enough if I praise you a hundred times?

408
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,400
Lu Chen.

409
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:06,200
Think about it.

410
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:07,510
Do you really want to stay in a tiny place

411
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:08,200
like Eastern Wilderness

412
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,160
for your entire life?

413
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:10,590
Pei Jiu, Pei Jiu.

414
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,720
Who's Lu Chen?

415
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,000
Are you slow in the head

416
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,880
and have a bad memory too?

417
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,200
That's not important.

418
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:16,830
I'm talking about your life.

419
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:19,000
Don't you want to go out

420
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,880
and see the world

421
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,960
and martial world?

422
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,000
Haven't you ever thought

423
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,920
that with your talent

424
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,880
and abilities,

425
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,480
you could easily become a swordsman

426
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,920
and do much greater things?

427
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,350
Go to a broader world?

428
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,960
When I get to that broader world,

429
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:33,380
what should I do?

430
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:37,880
Ride across the martial world.

431
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:39,510
Traverse the mountains.

432
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,790
Become a marquis or a minister.

433
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:43,590
Make a name for yourself.

434
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,240
If everyone becomes a marquis or a minister,

435
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:51,140
who will be the common people?

436
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,920
Who will farm the land?

437
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,830
You swordsmen in the martial world,

438
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,510
don't you need to eat?

439
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,240
And look,

440
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:02,070
Sir, your outfit

441
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,720
is so sleek and shiny.

442
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,590
When you're riding across the martial world,

443
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:06,550
do you wear clothes

444
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,680
or are you naked?

445
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:08,530
You—

446
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,880
Moreover, can you survive in the martial world

447
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:12,830
for a lifetime?

448
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,310
Is being a swordsman

449
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:16,460
such an impressive thing?

450
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,400
Do you martial world wanderers have official ranks?

451
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,920
Are you registered with the government?

452
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:26,680
Do you get allowances for holidays?

453
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:28,370
If you're injured or sick,

454
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:29,960
does the government provide medical care?

455
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,930
Do you get a monthly salary?

456
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,200
And also,

457
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,720
when you get old

458
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,510
and can't fight anymore,

459
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:37,880
how will you make a living?

460
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:41,580
You...

461
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:46,450
You'll have nothing.

462
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,000
That's not traversing the mountains.

463
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,870
That's called being homeless.

464
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,880
You've seen those little beggars

465
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,750
at the village entrance, right?

466
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:01,400
A bunch of tiny beggars,

467
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:03,400
hopping from one village to another.

468
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,400
When they grow up a bit,

469
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,240
they'll become

470
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,310
thieving troublemakers.

471
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,110
When they grow up more,

472
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,640
they'll become swordsmen like you.

473
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,490
To be honest,

474
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:12,960
among the cases we constables handle,

475
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:14,350
eight out of 10

476
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:15,920
are committed by people like you.

477
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:17,930
If I wanted to be a vagrant,

478
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,440
why would I go through all this trouble

479
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,630
to become a constable?

480
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,590
Why would I need to take you as my master?

481
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,750
As long as I choose the right path from the start,

482
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,590
I'll reach the peak right from the beginning.

483
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,880
I can be homeless from the beginning.

484
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:27,890
I mean,

485
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,790
be a swordsman.

486
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,430
I...

487
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:42,400
How is it?

488
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,590
It's a beautiful wedding dress.

489
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:46,440
You don't know,

490
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,680
but this was my wedding dress

491
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,920
from my last marriage.

492
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:49,830
Unfortunately, that poor soul

493
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:50,880
was short-lived.

494
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,590
He didn't have the fortune

495
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:52,960
to see me in such beautiful clothes.

496
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,000
It's alright, I'm not sad about it.

497
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,480
Out with the old, in with the new, right?

498
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,590
Besides, I'm getting married again.

499
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,590
Relationships come and go. It's all fate.

500
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,070
As for Pei Jiu,

501
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:10,790
he has many flaws,

502
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,070
but his good qualities

503
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,270
are truly good.

504
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,440
Are you going to marry Constable Pei?

505
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:20,790
You really like him, don't you?

506
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:24,750
He's alright.

507
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,270
He's sloppy and careless,

508
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:28,480
with no money or a background.

509
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,720
He doesn't even have any relatives.

510
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,510
If something were to happen,

511
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:32,680
there'd be no one to lend a hand.

512
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,200
But I think he's

513
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,830
reliable and steady.

514
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,310
I find him pleasing to look at,

515
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:37,960
so I don't care

516
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,880
about the other things.

517
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,180
I'm just waiting for him to earn some money now,

518
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,890
so he can fix up the house,

519
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,110
gather the betrothal gifts,

520
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,110
and prepare the money

521
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:45,830
for the wedding.

522
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,030
Then I'll go live with him.

523
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,130
I see your inn

524
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:49,750
has good business.

525
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:51,110
You have income every day.

526
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:52,750
You shouldn't be short of money.

527
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:55,070
Why do you have to wait for him to earn money

528
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:56,160
before you can get married?

529
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:57,590
If I don't wait for him to earn money,

530
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:59,110
should I subsidize him instead?

531
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,720
I-Is that not okay?

532
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,830
Of course not!

533
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,400
Being poor is one thing.

534
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,590
Having no ambition is another.

535
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:07,750
In these peaceful times,

536
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,240
is it really that hard to earn some money?

537
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,070
If he can't make big money,

538
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,240
can't he at least make some small money?

539
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,830
Making him do this is to let him experience

540
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:14,030
the feeling of wanting to

541
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:14,920
bring a wife home.

542
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:15,960
Moreover,

543
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,270
I want him to remember for the rest of his life

544
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:18,480
the hard work he put in

545
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,160
and the effort he made.

546
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,480
Only then will he cherish

547
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,550
the woman he marries.

548
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:24,510
If I were to have

549
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,830
the mindset of not caring whether he has money or not,

550
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,720
willing to walk barefoot

551
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,030
into his home,

552
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:28,790
then let me tell you,

553
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:29,310
my life

554
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,350
would definitely not be good.

555
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,270
Because from the moment he agrees

556
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:32,750
to let me enter his home in such a sorry state,

557
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,100
it's destined that he won't care about me.

558
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,510
At this very moment, right now,

559
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:36,240
he already doesn't care about me.

560
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,000
Do you understand?

561
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:41,160
I think I understand a little.

562
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,360
You still don't understand.

563
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:44,720
You haven't been married yet.

564
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,480
When you meet the person you want to marry,

565
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,070
when you meet someone

566
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,350
you fall for at first sight,

567
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,400
then you'll understand what I'm talking about.

568
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:51,630
Is that so?

569
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:00,900
What are you thinking about?

570
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,670
Thinking about your young master, aren't you?

571
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,160
You two are a couple, right?

572
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,240
No.

573
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:06,750
Impossible.

574
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:07,830
The way you look at him isn't normal.

575
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,240
The way he looks at you isn't normal either.

576
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:11,030
We really aren't.

577
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:13,160
Things between us are complicated.

578
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,360
You wouldn't understand.

579
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,680
What's so complicated about it?

580
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,310
Isn't it just that thing between a man and woman?

581
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:21,110
Let me ask you,

582
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,590
if Mr. Yuan got hurt,

583
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:24,590
would you be worried

584
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:25,550
and anxious?

585
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,350
Of course I would be worried.

586
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,590
Then if you get sick,

587
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:30,000
do you think he would be upset?

588
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:35,810
That's hard to say.

589
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,310
How can that be hard to say?

590
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:38,790
Of course he would be upset.

591
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,720
The fact is, you like him,

592
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:41,550
and he likes you too.

593
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:42,270
That's right.

594
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:43,790
Does he like me?

595
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,070
Isn't that obvious?

596
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,110
If he didn't like you,

597
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:47,000
why would he keep you by his side

598
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:47,650
all the time?

599
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:48,640
To annoy himself?

600
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:52,590
But he...

601
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,550
But even if he didn't bring me along,

602
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:56,400
I would naturally follow him anyway.

603
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:58,310
Well, there you have it.

604
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,030
You see,

605
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,510
you two are both in love.

606
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:01,920
You two should be together.

607
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,120
None of my ideas work!

608
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:07,980
What else can we do?

609
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:10,590
I'm starving.

610
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:11,680
We can't reason with him.

611
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,720
His temper is awful and stubborn.

612
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,750
And he's so pigheaded.

613
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,070
I can't beat him up for real.

614
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:16,400
He won't fall for any tricks either.

615
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:19,640
What's his weakness?

616
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,270
It might be because he has no money.

617
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,590
I heard something today.

618
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,750
Pei Jiu wants to

619
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,240
marry the landlady here,

620
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,000
but he doesn't have money to build a house,

621
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,310
buy the betrothal gifts,

622
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,160
or to hold the wedding.

623
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,070
So now

624
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:31,960
he's probably thinking about

625
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,550
how he can

626
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:33,720
get money from anywhere.

627
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,310
The thing is, you like him,

628
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:05,110
and he likes you too.

629
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:05,830
That's right.

630
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:15,160
Just looking at him makes me happy?

631
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,070
What are you standing there for?

632
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:23,830
Come and help.

633
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:28,590
I don't think so.

634
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,720
What do you mean?

635
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,720
Yunniang was wrong.

636
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:34,310
What was wrong?

637
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:37,510
I don't feel happy at all.

638
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,030
What are you

639
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:40,830
mumbling about?

640
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,510
I'm just not happy right now.

641
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:48,880
Are you guys done yet?

642
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,440
You're just meeting Lu Chen.

643
00:25:59,160 --> 00:25:59,880
Master.

644
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,590
Master.

645
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:02,790
Please accept your disciple's bow.

646
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,310
Master.

647
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:09,050
I've heard about your glorious deed of accepting disciples

648
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:09,950
for a hefty sum.

649
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:10,960
I understand all the rules.

650
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,180
I wish to become your disciple.

651
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,110
I'll devote myself to cultivation and serve you, Master.

652
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,140
Master, please accept me as your disciple.

653
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:17,210
I don't take disciples.

654
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,000
Master.

655
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,830
My aptitude is definitely better than Jiu's.

656
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,270
I'll learn whatever you teach.

657
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:22,240
I'll master everything.

658
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,590
Master, most importantly,

659
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:24,830
I'm not as greedy as Jiu.

660
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,160
I won't take so much money from you.

661
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:28,110
Master, just give whatever you think is appropriate.

662
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,070
Any amount will do.

663
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,990
Master, they're all after

664
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:32,050
the money in your pocket.

665
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,040
I'm different.

666
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,030
Money doesn't matter

667
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:35,000
to me.

668
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,350
I simply want to learn from

669
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:37,880
a generous master like you.

670
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:39,420
Master, please accept me.

671
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:40,640
As for the price,

672
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,640
we can negotiate it.

673
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,430
Master, give us a straight answer.

674
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:44,860
What exactly do you like about Jiu?

675
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:45,560
I can change.

676
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:46,990
Other than looks, I'm sure

677
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:48,730
I can change to be just like him.

678
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:51,090
-Master!
-Master!

679
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:58,110
I don't take disciples.

680
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:59,840
Master! Master! Master!

681
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:00,900
Master!

682
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,590
Master, please take me as your disciple!

683
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:03,310
San!

684
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:04,400
Si!

685
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:05,350
Where are they?

686
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:06,320
They just ran out.

687
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:08,200
Miss Ji,

688
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,350
come, I need a small favor.

689
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:10,240
Let's go, let's go.

690
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,030
Miss Ji,

691
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,230
I have an appointment with the butcher shop owner

692
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:17,030
to settle the bill.

693
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:18,270
Si and the others are not here.

694
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,350
It's almost mealtime,

695
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:20,830
but we can't let the poor man go hungry, right?

696
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:22,070
So I can only ask you

697
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:24,010
to help with this.

698
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:25,480
I can help,

699
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:27,070
but he's still unconscious.

700
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,480
Feeding him won't work.

701
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:30,260
This shows your lack of experience.

702
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:31,890
Pry open his mouth and feed him.

703
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,830
It doesn't matter how much he eats.

704
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,000
It's better than not eating at all, right?

705
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:35,930
Alright then, I'll be going now.

706
00:27:59,070 --> 00:27:59,880
Miss,

707
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:01,830
could you tell me how to get to the first-class cabins?

708
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,010
What did you say?

709
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,110
I... I was asking

710
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,330
how to get to the first-class cabins.

711
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,480
I remember now.

712
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,400
I've seen you before.

713
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:16,440
You got injured on the tower ship,

714
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,400
didn't you?

715
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,110
What a coincidence we meet again.

716
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,350
Come on, open your mouth.

717
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,270
You must eat more

718
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,310
so you can recover quickly.

719
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,350
Come on, hurry up.

720
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,350
Don't waste time.

721
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,750
I only have two hours to spare.

722
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,440
I'll leave when time's up.

723
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,240
I still need to go to the magistrate's office later.

724
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,640
I have a pile of things to do.

725
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:17,790
I've paid you the silver.

726
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,880
Listen to yourself.

727
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:22,170
If you hadn't paid me,

728
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,240
I wouldn't have come.

729
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,040
Come on.

730
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,720
Weren't you going to teach me martial arts?

731
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:27,720
Where do we start?

732
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:29,230
How about this?

733
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:31,030
Let me show you a horse stance first.

734
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,430
I'm not bragging,

735
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:34,060
but my martial arts

736
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:34,920
were drilled into me

737
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,440
by my adoptive father.

738
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,480
How is this?

739
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:41,250
I can teach this martial arts too.

740
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,040
Let me go first.

741
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,300
Leave it to me.

742
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,950
Let me tell you,

743
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:49,160
although I've taken your silver,

744
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:51,430
we agreed beforehand

745
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:52,880
that business is business.

746
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,070
This is a mutual agreement,

747
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,030
a fair trade.

748
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,770
You can't act recklessly.

749
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:00,510
I'm the town constable, you know.

750
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,000
You're overthinking it.

751
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,350
Business is business.

752
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,480
I know the difference.

753
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:08,830
Really?

754
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:10,100
Really.

755
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:14,380
Are you ready?

756
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:15,450
Alright.

757
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:20,260
From the Infinite comes the Supreme Ultimate.

758
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:21,330
Movement generates Yang energy.

759
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,420
Extreme stillness returns to motion.

760
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,030
Motion and then stillness.

761
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,540
Each is the root of the other.

762
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:37,720
Dividing into Yin and Yang.

763
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,510
The Two Principles are established.

764
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:40,620
Stop! Stop! Stop!

765
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,400
I quit! I quit!

766
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:44,920
No way.

767
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,340
You think my money is so easy to earn?

768
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:49,540
You said it yourself.

769
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:50,830
Business is business.

770
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:52,030
You know the difference.

771
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:53,680
What are you doing now?

772
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:54,640
Teaching you, of course.

773
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:56,960
Paying to teach you

774
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,790
is one thing.

775
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,770
If you make me angry and I beat you up,

776
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:01,200
that's another thing.

777
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,790
What kind of logic is that?

778
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,270
This is my logic.

779
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,110
The Two Principles generate the Four Images.

780
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:08,030
The Four Images generate the Eight Trigrams.

781
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:08,790
The natural order is thus established.

782
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:10,200
This is honorable title of Heaven's principle.

783
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,510
The ultimate is the utmost extreme.

784
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:15,070
The pivot is the foundation.

785
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:23,050
The pivot of heaven is the root.

786
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,180
What's wrong?

787
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,090
I'm not sure.

788
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,350
It feels a bit

789
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:52,310
different from before.

790
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,750
It's warm here.

791
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:54,660
Strangely comfortable.

792
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,400
You know,

793
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:03,430
although you're petty and hit hard,

794
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:05,180
you do have some skills.

795
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,640
The incantation you just recited,

796
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:07,400
what was it again?

797
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,270
You said it too fast.

798
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:09,120
I couldn't hear it clearly.

799
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,180
Could you say it again?

800
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,430
That set of incantations has nothing to do with you.

801
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,140
Nothing to do with me?

802
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,720
Then why were you reciting it just now?

803
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,160
You weren't just reciting it

804
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,790
to stall for time and beat me up, were you?

805
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:27,240
You really are...

806
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,440
Such a good master, aren't you?

807
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,400
Same time tomorrow.

808
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,680
I've taken the money anyway.

809
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:35,910
Master, don't be late.

810
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,170
Miss, what kind would you like?

811
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:52,550
I'd like to choose some

812
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:53,750
dry and fluffy ones.

813
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,110
No problem.

814
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,110
Tell me,

815
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,720
how many livestock do you have at home?

816
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:59,550
I'll calculate how much you need to buy.

817
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,680
We don't have any livestock at home.

818
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,000
There's just one sick person.

819
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:03,720
He's been ill and bedridden

820
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,680
for a long time.

821
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,160
With the weather being so hot lately,

822
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,790
the bedding is always damp.

823
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:08,270
So I thought

824
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:09,590
I'd choose some dry straw

825
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:10,350
to weave a mat for him.

826
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:11,240
It'll be more breathable.

827
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:13,350
Miss, you're so thoughtful.

828
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:15,310
I'll definitely get you the driest ones.

829
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:16,030
Thank you.

830
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,720
How are you?

831
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:48,960
Did you suffer internal injuries?

832
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:51,070
It's hard to say.

833
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:53,040
What do you mean by that?

834
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:53,750
If it is, it is.

835
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:54,960
If it's not, it's not.

836
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,170
I was in the middle of transmitting energy to Lu Chen.

837
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,350
Suddenly, a force appeared in his body

838
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,590
that didn't belong to him

839
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:06,440
and quickly entered my body.

840
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:08,840
I think this might be

841
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,280
the reason why Lu Chen broke through the seal prematurely

842
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,710
and lost his memory.

843
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,320
However, now that force

844
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,670
seems to have

845
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:16,710
settled down inside me.

846
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:19,000
But it still entered your body.

847
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,230
I'm worried

848
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:21,630
it might still affect you.

849
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:23,760
When I saw you practicing earlier,

850
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:25,230
you didn't look well.

851
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:29,130
It's fine. I have my own plans.

852
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:31,110
Don't overthink it.

853
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:39,440
Does your head hurt?

854
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:41,880
A little.

855
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:46,110
Let me massage it for you.

856
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,630
How is it? Do you feel any better?

857
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,000
Then let me

858
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,230
massage your neck.

859
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,710
It'll feel better this way.

860
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
You want to share yThe Book of Hundred Skills again, huh?

861
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:07,630
I did learn

862
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:09,510
this massage technique from the book.

863
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,440
You really do value her book.

864
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:14,440
You don't need to be so concerned about it.

865
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,030
Although this technique

866
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,590
was learned from The Book of Hundred Skills,

867
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:18,190
I have already

868
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:19,710
tried it on someone else

869
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,010
before using it on you.

870
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,510
Who did you try it on?

871
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,070
The unconscious patient

872
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:26,150
in the backyard.

873
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:29,430
He's quite lucky.

874
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:35,320
Do you think

875
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,030
Pei Jiu's personality will change drastically

876
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:38,590
after he regains his memory?

877
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,230
I wonder if the landlady

878
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:41,920
will still like him.

879
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:43,360
Can they

880
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,800
still be together happily?

881
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,440
Jiu! Jiu!

882
00:35:59,000 --> 00:35:59,800
What's the matter?

883
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:01,070
What do you mean?

884
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,510
I'm just greeting you.

885
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:04,000
Don't you recognize me?

886
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:05,760
By the way, I want to remind you

887
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,670
it's time to pay the debt you owe

888
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:08,510
at my wife's stall.

889
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:10,070
You keep buying on credit without paying.

890
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,190
That's not right, is it?

891
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,630
Besides, you've got money now.

892
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,110
I don't even know you.

893
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:17,180
You're saying I owe you money?

894
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:18,570
What are you talking about?

895
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:19,310
Constable Pei,

896
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,230
do you owe?

897
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,710
Of course you do.

898
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:24,070
I've heard

899
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:25,150
that you have found

900
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,320
a wealthy master

901
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:28,140
and you're pretending not to know me already?

902
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:29,950
If you want to keep up appearances,

903
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:31,340
at least pay your debts first.

904
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:33,520
You're crazy.

905
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,350
You...

906
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,510
You...

907
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,710
Your name is right here.

908
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,290
You can't deny it.

909
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:49,060
[Today, Pei Jiu owes Manager Zhu three taels of silver for meat. Pay it back in half a month. Pei Jiu.]

910
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,040
This way, please, sir.

911
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,320
This way, please, sir.

912
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,760
Sir,

913
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:17,670
you've eaten every meal here

914
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:18,960
for so many days in a row.

915
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,140
Aren't you tired of it?

916
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:22,400
What, are you?

917
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:25,840
Not yet, actually.

918
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,950
But it will be soon.

919
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:28,760
Just be patient for a few more days.

920
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,440
If the bait isn't set properly,

921
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,110
how can we catch the fish?

922
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:34,920
Fish?

923
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,880
We're in the dark here in Yandu.

924
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:39,600
The enemy is hidden while we're exposed.

925
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:41,690
Only by shining a bright light

926
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,440
can we lure the fish to take the bait.

927
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:47,020
You mean

928
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:48,710
someone is coming to kill us?

929
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:50,110
It won't come to that.

930
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,000
Are our skills just for show?

931
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:53,270
The reputation of the immortal race

932
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:54,920
is enough to deter petty criminals.

933
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:57,640
If it's not about killing,

934
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,110
then how can we

935
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,710
lure the fish to take the bait?

936
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,480
I think the people involved

937
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,630
will find it hard to remain calm.

938
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:05,710
Sooner or later, they'll come to investigate.

939
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:07,440
I understand now.

940
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,360
Whoever approaches us actively,

941
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,540
whoever is most suspicious,

942
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:12,500
is the fish we're after.

943
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:20,400
This way, please.

944
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,630
Come, come.

945
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:35,480
Take a break, have some water. Come on.

946
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:37,000
Hey, you up there!

947
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,150
Come down and have some water!

948
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:40,150
No, thanks. I'm busy working.

949
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,480
No rush, this bit of time won't matter.

950
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,510
How can you say there's no rush?

951
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:44,480
Even if you're not in a hurry,

952
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,570
Constable Pei is!

953
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,030
Have you set a date yet?

954
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:48,510
Soon, soon.

955
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:49,670
Let me tell you,

956
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:51,030
once I've mastered my skills

957
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,630
and finished all these miscellaneous tasks,

958
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:53,510
we'll get married.

959
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:55,440
You know what,

960
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,630
my master

961
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:58,010
really has some skills.

962
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,760
You're a lucky guy!

963
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,880
Everyone in town knows

964
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:02,310
you've found a wealthy master.

965
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,800
That's right.

966
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,280
Introduce us too.

967
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:06,860
We'd like to find a master as well.

968
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:07,920
Yeah.

969
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,710
That's right.

970
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,190
Go away, stop making a scene.

971
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:12,000
Get back to work.

972
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:14,440
Miss Ji,

973
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,280
I've always been curious though.

974
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,880
Tell me, what exactly

975
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,190
does my master do?

976
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,400
He must be a big merchant, right?

977
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:24,630
He used to manage everything,

978
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,550
but now,

979
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:26,800
he doesn't manage anything anymore.

980
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:28,330
Alright, alright.

981
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,800
You go back to work, hurry up.

982
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:31,840
Miss Ji,

983
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,480
don't mind Jiu. Just go about your business.

984
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:34,320
It's fine.

985
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,800
When we have time later,

986
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,400
we should fix up Uncle Pei's grave.

987
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,480
Now that we're better off,

988
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,440
we shouldn't neglect the old man.

989
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,510
I've been thinking about that.

990
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:44,320
I went to visit

991
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,590
my adoptive father's grave a couple of days ago.

992
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,110
Also,

993
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:48,280
the main gate of our courtyard

994
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,400
is always wobbly.

995
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,670
Find time to fix it too.

996
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,630
I'll do whatever you say.

997
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,710
You're the boss.

998
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:56,230
Don't flatter me.

999
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,150
If you flatter me,

1000
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:57,960
will all the household matters

1001
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,000
become my responsibility?

1002
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,090
Let me ask you,

1003
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:01,310
if we have a baby,

1004
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:02,120
what are we going to do?

1005
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,960
Don't worry about that.

1006
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,760
Leave it all to me.

1007
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,000
You just focus on giving birth.

1008
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,550
What are you talking about?

1009
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:11,800
Don't say that!

1010
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:15,510
Everyone, don't leave later,

1011
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:16,280
okay?

1012
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,920
Today, my master

1013
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,400
just gave me some money.

1014
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:20,360
It's perfect timing.

1015
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,230
I've also paid Mr. Zhu, the meat seller,

1016
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:23,000
settled the bill,

1017
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:23,630
and had him deliver

1018
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:24,630
a bunch of fresh meat.

1019
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:25,320
How about this?

1020
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,650
We'll feast

1021
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,070
at my place tonight.

1022
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,190
You guys go ahead and eat.

1023
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,190
We need to head back later

1024
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:33,480
to appease our own wives.

1025
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,030
Just these two dishes?

1026
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,800
Si took a day off and I can't cook.

1027
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,360
Just these two dishes. Take it or leave it.

1028
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:43,710
Yuanzhong,

1029
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:44,630
ever since you refused

1030
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:45,590
to take him as your disciple,

1031
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:46,760
he's been like this.

1032
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,150
Eat up. There's nothing else.

1033
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:50,920
Where is

1034
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:51,930
Ji Tanyin?

1035
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:52,840
They all went to Pei Jiu's house

1036
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,760
to fix up the place.

1037
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,710
I guess

1038
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:56,810
they'll probably eat there after they're done.

1039
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:58,630
I just saw someone delivering meat there.

1040
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:00,070
I bet tonight

1041
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:01,400
they're going to have a good meal.

1042
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:07,490
My disciple and my handmaiden

1043
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,920
are using my money

1044
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:11,280
to have a good time out there, huh?

1045
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:14,030
Yuanzhong,

1046
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,670
eat quickly.

1047
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,360
The food will taste worse if it gets cold.

1048
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:25,320
Aren't you eating?

1049
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:26,910
I'm not hungry. You go ahead and eat.

1050
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:29,620
Zi Fei, you're not eating either?

1051
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:31,370
No, you eat first.

1052
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:39,930
Yuanzhong,

1053
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:41,960
when do you think

1054
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,230
Lu Chen will wake up?

1055
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,380
Soon.

1056
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:46,670
I think he seems

1057
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,050
quite happy as Pei Jiu.

1058
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:50,400
I've never seen him this happy before.

1059
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:51,480
Yeah,

1060
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:52,960
I wonder

1061
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,710
if he'll still be

1062
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:56,280
this happy after he wakes up.

1063
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:02,100
The roast chicken is here!

1064
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,110
Stop fussing around and sit down.

1065
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:05,000
Okay.

1066
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:06,760
So many dishes!

1067
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:07,710
Can the three of us

1068
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:08,920
finish it all?

1069
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,190
Pei Jiu, Pei Jiu!

1070
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,400
Are you home?

1071
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,550
Wait for me.

1072
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:17,120
I knew you'd come.

1073
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,480
Come in quickly.

1074
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,110
Alright.

1075
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:19,880
Come on, let me tell you.

1076
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:20,800
You're in for a treat today,

1077
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,550
you know?

1078
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:22,760
Here.

1079
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,480
This wine is really good.

1080
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,730
There's wine and meat here.

1081
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,960
What's the occasion today?

1082
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:29,760
It's the day for house renovation, of course.

1083
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,510
No.

1084
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:34,840
Today is our engagement.

1085
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,730
The date has been set?

1086
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:38,710
Yes.

1087
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:39,630
Today, I

1088
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:40,960
went to Blind Liu for a fortune-telling.

1089
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:43,150
The 9th of next month is an auspicious day.

1090
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,480
So, I plan to take Yunniang home

1091
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,190
as my bride that day.

1092
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:48,960
That's wonderful!

1093
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:50,800
So, it's just in a few days, isn't it?
