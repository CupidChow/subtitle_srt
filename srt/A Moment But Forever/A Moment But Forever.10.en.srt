00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,259
[A Moment But Forever]

2
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:47,250
[Episode 10]

3
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,990
Our two clans have always been closely connected.

4
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,670
I hope we can join hands this time as well

5
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:53,830
to stand together through thick and thin.

6
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:55,110
Rest assured, Sir.

7
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,670
I will certainly report this matter

8
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,830
to the City Lord as soon as possible.

9
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,310
Later,

10
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,630
I will also personally go to Yandu

11
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,430
to meet with the City Lord

12
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,230
and discuss this matter with him.

13
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,630
That'll be great.

14
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:09,990
Please.

15
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,030
Please.

16
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,500
So it's really someone from the Youhu Clan.

17
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,510
Perfect for consecrating my blade.

18
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:29,920
Are you alright?

19
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,270
Are you hurt anywhere?

20
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:32,950
What's going on?

21
00:02:33,579 --> 00:02:34,390
The light fell.

22
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,790
So you're the manager of this ship?

23
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:37,829
Yes, I am.

24
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:38,829
Who are you?

25
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,230
This is Xue,

26
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:41,230
a kitchen maid.

27
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,350
Hey, you—

28
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:44,140
As the manager,

29
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,510
you should do your job properly.

30
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,490
The mast light is a device for transmitting signals.

31
00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:48,630
It ensures the ship's

32
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:49,910
safe navigation at night.

33
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:50,550
It should be kept lit

34
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,790
at all times.

35
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:53,110
Theoretically, before each trip,

36
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,430
you should check it carefully.

37
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,430
But now?

38
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,390
Look at this.

39
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:58,070
It looks like it hasn't been maintained for years.

40
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:58,800
With a ship in this condition,

41
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,180
how dare you carry so many passengers?

42
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:01,660
Aren't you worried about accidents?

43
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,150
That's right.

44
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,420
She has a point.

45
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,710
You do your job poorly.

46
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:09,310
Manager Cao,

47
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:09,940
before we set off,

48
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,150
we checked everything one by one.

49
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,550
We didn't find anything unusual.

50
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:13,550
Well, if you checked,

51
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:14,870
how could it fall down?

52
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:17,180
I truly don't know.

53
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:18,390
When we were inspecting,

54
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:19,460
it wasn't just me.

55
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,460
He Liu, Li Lian, and others were all present.

56
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:23,870
Manager, you can call them all

57
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,270
and question them one by one.

58
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,430
Sir!

59
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,110
Sir,

60
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:39,590
the High Priest of the Youhu Clan

61
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,110
is also on our ship.

62
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,270
Who?

63
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:44,140
The High Priest.

64
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,710
What exactly is today?

65
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,190
The Great Priest of the Youhu Clan

66
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,270
and Mr. Tanghua

67
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,630
are both on my ship.

68
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:56,310
Great.

69
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,390
That's not right.

70
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,070
If they're both on the ship,

71
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,390
why aren't they together?

72
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,110
You're back.

73
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:17,269
Was dinner sumptuous?

74
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:18,390
Yuanzhong sent you here?

75
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,110
He wants you to get off at the next stop.

76
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:22,430
Why?

77
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,630
He said he gets annoyed just by seeing you.

78
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,950
He told you to stop following him.

79
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:29,470
Mr. Tanghua,

80
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,780
these snacks can't be kept overnight.

81
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:32,909
You've already eaten.

82
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,540
How about I take them away?

83
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,390
You should leave.

84
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,030
His seal has been removed.

85
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,110
He's very strong.

86
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,950
If you really anger him,

87
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,220
he might beat you up.

88
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,030
I'm just looking out for you.

89
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:50,350
Is he going to break

90
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,909
the seals of the other weapon spirits?

91
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,390
Then go find the War Demon?

92
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:54,590
I can help him.

93
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:55,870
When he does things,

94
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,270
he never needs help from others.

95
00:04:57,409 --> 00:04:59,240
He didn't need it before, and it's the same now.

96
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,040
Don't worry about it.

97
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,500
Mr. Tanghua, I'm leaving.

98
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,710
Yuanzhong.

99
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:17,470
Did you see him?

100
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:18,790
Did you say everything I told you to say?

101
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:19,500
I did.

102
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:20,310
What did he say?

103
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,230
He didn't say anything.

104
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,670
But his face was twisted with anger.

105
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:27,470
Will he leave?

106
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:28,950
I don't know.

107
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,270
Probably not.

108
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,020
Then why did you make me tell him?

109
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:33,790
Did you

110
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:35,430
just want me to go and annoy him?

111
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,260
Yuanzhong,

112
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:41,070
I think Tanghua is a good person.

113
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,830
Even if you insist on doing this,

114
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,670
he didn't commit any major offense, right?

115
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,550
Cowardice is a sin.

116
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,680
But he's not a coward anymore.

117
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,310
He risked his life to perform

118
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,150
the possessing technique.

119
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:51,750
Wasn't that to

120
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,909
save you?

121
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,300
That's even worse.

122
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:56,140
Ignorance is one of the Five Sins.

123
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,510
He's so stupid.

124
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:58,560
Doesn't he deserve to die?

125
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:00,510
You can say he's ignorant,

126
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:01,950
or you can say he's kind.

127
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,070
Everything has

128
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,230
two sides, positive and negative.

129
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:05,430
It just depends on what perspective

130
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:06,430
you use to understand it.

131
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,030
You're the one who told me this.

132
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,590
Are you trying to debate philosophy with me?

133
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,150
I can't argue with you.

134
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,420
Your evil roots run deep.

135
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,180
I'm just expressing my own opinion.

136
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:16,590
I am your weapon spirit,

137
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,390
closely connected to you,

138
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,350
sharing the same fate.

139
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:21,990
No matter what you do,

140
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,410
I have to support you.

141
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:24,950
You sound reluctant.

142
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:32,550
What is this thing?

143
00:06:33,409 --> 00:06:34,260
Grudge Bird.

144
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:35,560
Grudge Bird?

145
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,630
Isn't it born from blood and resentment?

146
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,950
Why would it attack you?

147
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:40,990
Yuanzhong,

148
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,440
you're still having bad luck?

149
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:45,350
This Ji Tanyin,

150
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,950
what's her background anyway?

151
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:57,430
Twice.

152
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,850
He killed you twice.

153
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:02,310
And you just forgave him like that?

154
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,150
Yes,

155
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,040
didn't I already say this?

156
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,750
He was kind to people on the ship,

157
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,670
always willing to help others.

158
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,420
That proves I wasn't wrong about him.

159
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:10,350
He deserves me to

160
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:11,510
continue fulfilling my promise.

161
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:12,750
Moreover,

162
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,790
Yuanzhong suspected me

163
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:15,910
for a reason.

164
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:17,870
I'm immortal,

165
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,030
with a constitution similar to the War Demon.

166
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,670
He thought I was his enemy,

167
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,790
so he attacked me.

168
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:23,750
There's no problem with that.

169
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:26,590
And as a god,

170
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:28,070
I should be magnanimous and forgiving.

171
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,990
Don't you agree?

172
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:29,630
Right.

173
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,590
No, not right.

174
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:32,590
I just want to ask

175
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,180
if he's still

176
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:34,980
alive now?

177
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:36,750
He's still alive and well now.

178
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,670
Why should he die?

179
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:38,990
He killed a god.

180
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,830
You are a fifth-rank true god

181
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,350
bestowed by heaven.

182
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:45,030
Killing you is a violation of the heavenly way.

183
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,310
He must face divine punishment.

184
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,490
From now on, in this world,

185
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:49,470
there will be no place for him to exist in,

186
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:51,510
until the laws of heaven

187
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,270
completely erase him.

188
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:00,830
No wonder his luck has been so bad lately.

189
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:01,550
I was thinking

190
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,030
of making a luck-turning device

191
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:04,190
to protect him.

192
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:06,470
But wait,

193
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,790
I've already forgiven him.

194
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:09,670
Why is the heavenly way

195
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:11,030
still not letting him go?

196
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:12,790
Did you tell him face to face

197
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:13,750
in person

198
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:14,870
that you forgive him?

199
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:16,630
No.

200
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:17,880
That's why it's useless!

201
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,740
This kind of forgiveness is not accepted.

202
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,590
You must tell him in person.

203
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:37,659
[Invitation]

204
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,270
It's my honor for the High Priest

205
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:41,429
to board this ship.

206
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:44,110
I have specially prepared a banquet

207
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:46,180
to welcome you.

208
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,630
I hope you can come.

209
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,230
Did you invite Tanghua as well?

210
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,220
Yes, I did.

211
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:58,870
If you don't want him,

212
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,540
I can also…

213
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,540
It's fine.

214
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,550
It's just having a meal together.

215
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:05,100
The more, the merrier.

216
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:06,520
Let's go.

217
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,230
High Priest, please.

218
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:43,870
Tanyin!

219
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:50,880
Oh, you.

220
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:52,580
Next time you go out, let me know.

221
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,990
Otherwise, if we're both seen together,

222
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:55,150
that would be terrible.

223
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,110
I got it.

224
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,190
Are you looking for someone?

225
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:03,230
Do you know Mr. Yuan?

226
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:04,150
Yes.

227
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:06,310
But it seems he's gone out.

228
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:09,510
The master is welcoming him

229
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,670
in the Qinglong Hall tonight.

230
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,000
He should have gone to attend the banquet.

231
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,430
The master specifically ordered guards

232
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:20,310
to stand guard outside the door.

233
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:21,870
He probably doesn't want to be disturbed.

234
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,070
Tanyin,

235
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,790
what do you want to go in for?

236
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,260
I just need to go in and say one thing.

237
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:30,150
Can't it wait until the banquet is over

238
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,030
to say it then?

239
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,550
Come with me.

240
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,110
Who could the master

241
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,230
be entertaining?

242
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:41,430
Even the Jiaoli wine gifted by the City Lord

243
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:42,430
has been brought out.

244
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,590
They're even performing the Yunmen dance.

245
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:44,190
Do you know who it is?

246
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:46,640
Isn't that a dance of worship?

247
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:48,150
Why are you here?

248
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,910
I came to see

249
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,550
if there's anything I can help with.

250
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,310
Why are you everywhere?

251
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:54,240
Alright,

252
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:55,300
we might be short-handed when serving

253
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,350
the dishes and wine later.

254
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,630
Come over and wait here first.

255
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,430
Such a strong aura of death.

256
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,420
[Qinglong Hall]

257
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,190
We humans have a saying,

258
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,060
"Isn't it a joy to have friends

259
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,270
come from afar?"

260
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,780
The High Priest and Mr. Tanghua

261
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,000
are the most honored guests of the human race.

262
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,810
To have both of you aboard today

263
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,940
is truly a blessing of three lifetimes.

264
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:29,800
I, Shen, have been extremely anxious these past few days,

265
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:32,150
fearing that my hospitality might be inadequate.

266
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:33,690
If there's any negligence,

267
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:37,070
I hope both of you will be forgiving.

268
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:38,990
You're too kind, Mr. Shen.

269
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:40,670
This ship of yours is excellently built.

270
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,270
I quite like it.

271
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:45,510
Since the High Priest likes it,

272
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,600
my life has not been in vain.

273
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:53,950
Yesterday, when Mr. Tanghua told me

274
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,830
about the War Demon incident,

275
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:59,390
I was both angry and afraid.

276
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,700
I couldn't sleep all night.

277
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:02,170
In five more days,

278
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,330
this ship will reach Yandu directly.

279
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,670
At that time, I will certainly

280
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,380
report this matter truthfully to the City Lord.

281
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:10,410
High Priest,

282
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,720
what is the destination

283
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,300
of your journey?

284
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,110
Is it Yandu?

285
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:16,350
No.

286
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,680
Then Mr. Tanghua,

287
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,550
you're going to Yandu with me, right?

288
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:23,910
I'm not going anymore.

289
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:25,350
Why not?

290
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:27,990
Someone is forcing me off the ship.

291
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,020
I can't go anymore.

292
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,190
This is the human race's

293
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:37,660
homemade Jiaoli wine.

294
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,030
It can't be compared

295
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,110
to the fine wines

296
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,470
of the Youhu Clan,

297
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,720
but it has its own unique flavor.

298
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:44,980
Please, both of you, have a taste.

299
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:48,230
High Priest, please.

300
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,460
Mr. Tanghua.

301
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,190
The High Priest hasn't left

302
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:04,310
the mountain in many years.

303
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,960
This time, you've come down to travel.

304
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:08,340
Where are you going?

305
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:10,540
Mr. Shen,

306
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,290
are you trying to inquire about my whereabouts?

307
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,150
I wouldn't dare.

308
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,330
Actually,

309
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,250
I don't know where I'm going either.

310
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,150
I got bored staying on the mountain

311
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,070
and there were people I didn't want to see.

312
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,860
So I thought I'd come down and travel around.

313
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,360
But who would have thought that after coming down the mountain,

314
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:27,560
I still can't avoid them?

315
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:30,390
What's that phrase again?

316
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:32,850
Right, "Lingering like a ghost."

317
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:37,030
But nine out of 10 things in life

318
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,100
are disappointments.

319
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,850
No one can have smooth sailing all the time.

320
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,040
Ups and downs, annoyances and bad luck...

321
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:43,390
This is the normal state of life.

322
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,730
I've come to terms with it.

323
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,210
You are humorous.

324
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:50,730
Why don't I call for some music and dancing?

325
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:51,950
My ship

326
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,860
happens to have a few top-class performers.

327
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,270
Their dancing and singing

328
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,560
are all excellent.

329
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,230
Dancing?

330
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,700
Mr. Tanghua is also very skilled at it.

331
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,500
Why don't we have him do a dance?

332
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,280
Well...

333
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,900
That's not quite appropriate, is it?

334
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,710
What's wrong with that?

335
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:08,550
Actually, it's not just Mr. Tanghua.

336
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,670
We of the Youhu Clan

337
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:11,830
are also very skilled at brewing wine by scent,

338
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:12,910
and entertaining with song and dance.

339
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,180
Although I haven't done it for many years,

340
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,020
I can still occasionally

341
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,180
perform a piece.

342
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:19,990
High Priest, you are really talented.

343
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:22,670
Do you have a Go board?

344
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:23,550
Yes, we do.

345
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:24,910
Then how about this?

346
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,590
I'll play a game of Go with Mr. Tanghua.

347
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,860
Whoever loses

348
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,010
will perform a dance

349
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,350
to entertain you.

350
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:32,550
Consider it payment for your wine.

351
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:34,860
Alright.

352
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:40,190
There are no set rules.

353
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:41,900
No need to be modest either.

354
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:43,590
If you manage to surround me,

355
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:45,320
it means my skills are lacking.

356
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,860
But if I accidentally slaughter you,

357
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,750
we'll just have to chalk it up to your bad luck.

358
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:53,150
Don't be like when you were little,

359
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:55,070
crying when you lost a game

360
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:56,540
and tattling on me to everyone.

361
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:58,870
Mr. Tanghua,

362
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,380
do you dare?

363
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,390
Why wouldn't I dare?

364
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:09,350
It's almost time.

365
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:10,790
Move quickly. Follow me.

366
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,110
Hurry.

367
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:27,750
What's inside?

368
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:29,270
Can I take a look?

369
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:37,910
You left before I finished speaking.

370
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:39,070
You're so rude.

371
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:51,940
Such a sharp weapon.

372
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:55,590
Oh no.

373
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:02,230
You're in too deep now.

374
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:04,310
If you don't make a killing move,

375
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:05,320
you will be

376
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,310
the one who dies.

377
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,410
What does this mean?

378
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,180
Don't you want to conquer territory?

379
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,340
I'll let you have it.

380
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,070
How sincere of you.

381
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,150
Unfortunately, I don't care for

382
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:31,390
what you're offering.

383
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:36,390
I've been yielding repeatedly because I wanted to.

384
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:38,350
If I didn't want to,

385
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:40,470
it would be like metal clashing against stone,

386
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,030
jade shattering everywhere.

387
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:50,230
You've actually won.

388
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:51,830
Precise calculations,

389
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:53,320
decisive in attack.

390
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:54,950
Tanghua,

391
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,430
it's been years since we've faced each other.

392
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,110
Your chess skills have improved.

393
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,940
What's the use of winning?

394
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,190
You still saw right through me,

395
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,150
using me completely.

396
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:09,060
Occasional gains and losses aren't worth mentioning.

397
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:09,910
Haven't I also had

398
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:11,589
times when I lost to you?

399
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,950
But I've never seen you as an opponent.

400
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:18,960
Good game.

401
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:20,630
What a great game indeed.

402
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,510
The choices made, the gains and losses

403
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:23,630
were mysterious

404
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:24,950
and absolutely brilliant.

405
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:26,630
I accept my loss.

406
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:28,950
I've watched you all

407
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,190
perform the dance of worship year after year

408
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:31,910
but never had the chance to try it myself.

409
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:32,830
Mr. Shen,

410
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:34,200
bring me a dance costume.

411
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,630
I'll perform a dance for everyone today

412
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:37,480
to liven things up.

413
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:38,950
That's wonderful!

414
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:39,990
We are truly fortunate

415
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:41,390
to be able to see

416
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:44,030
the dance skills of the High Priest.

417
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:06,050
Who was she?

418
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:08,030
How did she see through me?

419
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,230
Have you heard?

420
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:11,970
The Great Priest of the Youhu Clan is inside.

421
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:13,390
The Great Priest of the Youhu Clan?

422
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:14,830
Isn't it Mr. Tanghua?

423
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,180
It's the High Priest.

424
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,150
I heard it from the handmaiden inside.

425
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:20,750
No wonder they want us to perform the Yunmen dance.

426
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:22,340
The High Priest is a god.

427
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,820
Of course they want to see the dance of worship.

428
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,780
High Priest.

429
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,630
No wonder.

430
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:29,470
You can go in now.

431
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:30,870
Let's go, go in.

432
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:42,990
Stop. You can't go in.

433
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:44,940
But I have something to do.

434
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:45,990
It doesn't matter what you have to do.

435
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:47,430
The master is entertaining important guests.

436
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:48,390
Don't cause trouble.

437
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,990
Which one is it?

438
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:24,990
Find her quickly.

439
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,030
Don't let her escape.

440
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,190
What are you doing?

441
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,120
Be careful!

442
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:13,550
Yuanzhong!

443
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,430
Hurry, get a doctor!

444
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,430
Hurry, get a doctor!

445
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:18,710
Yes, go!

446
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:47,220
How could this be?

447
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:48,950
This weapon is strange.

448
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,030
My magical power has no effect at all.

449
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:53,300
Quickly, use the Divine Left Hand!

450
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:54,750
Counter this evil energy!

451
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:02,870
Hurry, activate the Divine Hand to save yourself!

452
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:12,280
The Divine Hand seems to have no effect anymore.

453
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:20,830
Dr. Sun, please hurry!

454
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,030
Come, this way.

455
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:25,230
Sir, the doctor is here.

456
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:25,910
Hurry, hurry!

457
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:26,870
He got food poisoning.

458
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:27,710
I had a hard time finding...

459
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:28,520
Save him quickly!

460
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,310
Hurry!

461
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:32,630
Where's your medicine?

462
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,470
I don't know either.

463
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,080
♫Time never defeats the fleeting world♫

464
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:36,310
I just checked the medicine box at noon.

465
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,710
How did it end up like this?

466
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:39,810
♫Stars turn, shining upon the passing traveler♫

467
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:39,350
Go away.

468
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:41,460
Yuanzhong.

469
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:43,840
♫The wind rises, flowers fall and bloom again♫

470
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:42,750
Yuanzhong, Yuanzhong!

471
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,430
Yuanzhong, wake up quickly!

472
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,860
♫Awaiting what’s lost to be regained♫

473
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:45,150
I don't blame you anymore.

474
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:46,180
I forgive you.

475
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:49,110
The High Priest lost too much blood.

476
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:50,790
♫These countless virtues and joys♫

477
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,640
He seems to have passed out.

478
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:53,070
This kind of forgiveness is not accepted.

479
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:55,320
♫Dusk and dawn, only you make parting hard♫

480
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:55,870
You must tell him in person.

481
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:01,510
♫I'm willing to risk my life for this♫

482
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:05,230
♫Wind chimes beat with my heart♫

483
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:09,380
♫Harmonizing, can you recognize it?♫

484
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,150
Yuanzhong, don't sleep.

485
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,830
Listen to me.

486
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:10,750
I forgive you.

487
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:12,440
♫Fingertips tracing your outline♫

488
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:11,950

♫I wish to see through you♫

490
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:14,500

♫Whether near or far♫

492
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,820
♫We can still gaze upon the same galaxy♫

493

♫Knowing we've never been apart for a moment♫

495
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,830

503

You're awake.

504
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,230
Where's Zi Fei?

505
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:26,190
Outside.

506
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:28,310
Zi Fei.

507
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:29,850
Zi—

508
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:31,150
Don't move around.

509
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,110
The assassin's weapon is quite strange.

510
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:34,550
Even with your Divine Left Hand,

511
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:35,970
you haven't fully recovered.

512
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,150
Yuanzhong.

513
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,070
Where's the assassin?

514
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:44,130
We couldn't catch him. He jumped off the ship and escaped.

515
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:45,110
It was a War Demon.

516
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,170
His skills were impressive.

517
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,110
Go.

518
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:49,780
Bring Ji Tanyin to me.

519
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:50,990
Ji Tanyin?

520
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:53,710
She goes by Xue now.

521
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:55,990
How do you know

522
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:57,550
the High Priest of Youhu Clan?

523
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,580
And why did you

524
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,290
say those words to him just now?

525
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:06,180
Our master is asking you a question.

526
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:09,150
I can't tell you.

527
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:09,920
This—

528
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:10,990
How dare you!

529
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:13,210
Don't scold me.

530
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:15,310
Cursing me will bring divine punishment.

531
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:17,130
I'm doing this for both of your sakes.

532
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:18,370
You—

533
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:21,190
Mr. Shen,

534
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,790
the High Priest asked me to look for someone.

535
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:23,820
Her name is Xue.

536
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:29,830
The War Demon actually has

537
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:31,060
a weapon that can counter you.

538
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:32,380
This matter is too important.

539
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:34,190
I must send a message back to our clan immediately

540
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:35,150
to urge the War Division to intensify the search

541
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:36,310
for traces of the War Demon.

542
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:37,290
Also,

543
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:39,290
I believe this matter is related to the human race.

544
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:40,990
I need to go to Yandu City

545
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:42,330
to meet with the City Lord of Yandu.

546
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:43,870
You should rest well first.

547
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:44,710
It's important to recover from your injuries.

548
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:45,430
Tanghua.

549
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:49,110
We are no longer friends.

550
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:51,970
Why not?

551
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:53,870
Don't you know why?

552
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:56,750
Because back then,

553
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:00,510
I concealed the fact that your parents had died.

554
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:05,750
At that time, the war was at a stalemate.

555
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:08,070
The War Demon chief had developed

556
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,510
the perfect War Demon body.

557
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,810
He led a large group of elites to attack.

558
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:13,680
The human race was wavering.

559
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,590
Our clan's rear was vulnerable.

560
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,250
Under attack from both front and rear,

561
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:19,270
how could I distract you at that time?

562
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:24,190
The deaths of your parents and sister

563
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:26,650
were accidents.

564
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:28,430
I had intended to...

565
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:30,940
To tell you afterwards.

566
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:33,030
But you were injured

567
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:36,020
and I was sent away by Dingxu.

568
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,270
I never imagined they would

569
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:40,630
seal you.

570
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:43,350
Yuanzhong,

571
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:46,710
I deeply regret it.

572
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,820
These years haven't been easy for me either.

573
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:55,790
Tanghua,

574
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:59,510
have you ever seen the sky from inside a well?

575
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,830
It's only as big as a palm.

576
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:10,220
There's no sun, moon, or stars in it.

577
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:14,160
It's empty and void.

578
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,250
There's nothing there.

579
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:22,740
I looked at it for 40 years.

580
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:26,510
My heart has become closed too.

581
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:28,490
No matter how many reasons you have,

582
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:30,910
I can't accept them.

583
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,830
I treated you as a brother,

584
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:36,190
but under the excuse of

585
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:37,660
doing what's best for me,

586
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,630
you helped them deceive me,

587
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:42,400
causing me to not see daylight for 40 years,

588
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,290
enduring all kinds of humiliation.

589
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:46,370
What makes you think

590
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,350
I would understand you?

591
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:00,790
Spilt water cannot be gathered up.

592
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:03,790
Why force the impossible?

593
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,760
Next.

594
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,220
No, I'll go first.

595
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:31,590
Yuan.

596
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:35,550
Stop crying.

597
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:37,270
It's embarrassing.

598
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:39,950
Yuan.

599
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:41,670
Alright.

600
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:43,510
If I succeed,

601
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:45,390
I'll treat you to the best food and drink in the future.

602
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:49,100
If I die and you're still alive,

603
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:51,910
remember to take good care of

604
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:52,990
my parents and sister for me.

605
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:55,190
No, no.

606
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:56,550
Don't.

607
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:57,350
I'll do it myself.

608
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:39,270
You're too late.

609
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:41,350
I met someone I dislike.

610
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,000
I remembered something unpleasant.

611
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:44,790
I'm in a bad mood.

612
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:50,510
Come here.

613
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,310
W-Why?

614
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:55,940
Why?

615
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:58,740
My hair is messy.

616
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,230
Comb my hair for me.

617
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:20,460
Your name is Xue, right?

618
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:24,670
I used to have a handmaiden

619
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:26,070
who was similar to you.

620
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:28,030
She was skilled in craftsmanship.

621
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:29,750
Her handiwork was superb.

622
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,670
The things she made were exquisitely crafted.

623
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:35,470
Even the master craftsmen of the human race

624
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:36,920
couldn't match her skills.

625
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:44,630
Unfortunately, she wasn't very bright.

626
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,310
She always liked to say

627
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:47,790
illogical things.

628
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:49,350
She also always liked

629
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:51,470
to find ways to get close to me.

630
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:54,070
I couldn't drive her away,

631
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:56,030
nor could I shake her off.

632
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:02,870
Aren't you curious?

633
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:06,270
C-Curious about what?

634
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,140
I said you're very similar to her.

635
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,510
Aren't you curious about how you're similar?

636
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,500
Well, you see,

637
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,800
I have one good quality.

638
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:17,850
I'm not very curious.

639
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:20,240
I don't really want to know about other people's business.

640
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:23,950
What a shame, then.

641
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:27,190
I happen to be in the mood to talk right now,

642
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,270
even if you don't want to know.

643
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,100
You're just like her.

644
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,790
Your background is strange,

645
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:38,240
and your methods are strange too.

646
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,700
Most importantly,

647
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,630
I can't see through you clearly.

648
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:46,770
I'm unable to guess

649
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,240
or understand.

650
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:02,860
Y-Yuanzhong.

651
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:12,190
Ji Tanyin.

652
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:15,350
You really are hard to kill.

653
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:17,790
I don't understand.

654
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:19,580
As a War Demon,

655
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,150
why do you repeatedly

656
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:23,070
sabotage your own people's plans?

657
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:25,830
What are you really after?

658
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:27,430
I'm not a War Demon.

659
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:28,590
You think I'd

660
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:29,910
believe your lies?

661
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:31,160
I'm telling the truth.

662
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,190
I hate being lied to the most.

663
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:35,350
I'm not lying.

664
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,210
What are you doing?

665
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:43,710
I'm going to verify it.

666
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:56,130
That person failed.

667
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:57,350
He was forced to jump off the ship.

668
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:58,980
He's definitely dead.

669
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,880
With all this commotion,

670
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:03,030
security has been increased throughout the ship.

671
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,830
This is very unfavorable for us.

672
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,230
We can't worry about that now.

673
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:08,680
Tomorrow, the ship

674
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,310
will dock at Tianfang City.

675
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:11,990
It has a major port,

676
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,390
with a military garrison stationed there.

677
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,230
It will be even harder for us to make our move.

678
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:16,020
Tonight

679
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,730
is our last chance.

680
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:21,270
Have you all memorized the locations

681
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,850
for placing the fire bombs?

682
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:23,680
Yes.

683
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:28,310
Most of the Shen family's ship workers are in the lower cabins.

684
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:30,070
In two more hours,

685
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:31,790
it will be their mealtime.

686
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,470
As long as we guard this exit

687
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,470
and use fire bombs to blast the cabin doors,

688
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,550
we can suffocate them inside.

689
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:39,460
Yes.

690
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:42,110
This is where the officials and nobles reside.

691
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:43,950
Most of them have guards with them.

692
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:45,150
Once the signal is given,

693
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,640
attack this area first.

694
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:48,070
Yes.

695
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:50,710
Our target is the Spirit-Gathering Cabin.

696
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:52,670
This is where the ship's power source is located.

697
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:54,030
It's heavily guarded.

698
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:55,750
If we destroy this place,

699
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:57,390
even a god

700
00:33:57,390 --> 00:33:58,630
won't be able to save them.

701
00:33:59,030 --> 00:33:59,820
Understood.

702
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:06,630
Men, we are not

703
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:08,150
bandits who kill indiscriminately.

704
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:11,070
We are fighting for the future of the human race.

705
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:12,650
Out with the old, in with the new.

706
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:13,949
Break things down to rebuild them.

707
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:16,060
Future generations will give us

708
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:17,670
a fair evaluation.

709
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:23,030
No regrets, even in death.

710
00:34:23,989 --> 00:34:25,159
No regrets, even in death.

711
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:26,510
No regrets, even in death.

712
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:32,960
Come on, let's drink until we're drunk!

713
00:34:58,670 --> 00:34:59,950
I'm not a War Demon.

714
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:03,190
Then how do you explain this?

715
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,600
There's nothing to explain.

716
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:08,870
Besides, in this world,

717
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:09,870
it's not only War Demons

718
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:11,110
who have this kind of constitution.

719
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,820
You don't know simply because

720
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:14,110
you're ignorant, that's all.

721
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:15,560
I'm ignorant?

722
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,120
You're not going to say you're a god, are you?

723
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:27,950
Anyway,

724
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:30,070
I'm not a bad person.

725
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:31,510
I won't harm you either.

726
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:33,270
I know you don't believe me,

727
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:34,980
but I still have to stay by your side.

728
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:36,150
Even if you don't allow it,

729
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:37,310
I will still follow you.

730
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:38,510
Ji Tanyin,

731
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:39,950
are you...

732
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:48,510
The Spirit-Gathering Cabin has been bombed!

733
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,350
Kill them!

734
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:52,070
Watch out!

735
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:55,170
Sir! Sir!

736
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:56,270
What happened?

737
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:58,180
A group of bandits bombed the Spirit-Gathering Cabin.

738
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:58,710
Our ship

739
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:00,030
is now low on power.

740
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:00,630
Don't panic, sir.

741
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:01,910
We still have another Spirit-Gathering Cabin.

742
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:03,790
Quickly, stop them!

743
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:04,390
No matter what,

744
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:05,870
we must protect that Spirit-Gathering Cabin.

745
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:06,830
Otherwise, if the ship sinks,

746
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:07,830
we'll all fall to our deaths.

747
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:08,670
Yes. Hurry!

748
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:09,710
Let's go, quickly!

749
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:11,230
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

750
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:20,870
The smell of blood is so strong.

751
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,750
Grudge Bird!

752
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:52,440
Go!

753
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,150
Yes!

754
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,720
Don't catch me!

755
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:35,990
Oh my god, I'm done for!

756
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:42,400
Tanyin!

757
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:43,510
Run to the cabin quickly!

758
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:44,990
Okay!

759
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:23,230
Yuanzhong, save them!

760
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:33,190
Get to the cabin! Get to the cabin!

761
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:34,110
Get to the cabin!

762
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:34,990
Don't catch me!

763
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:35,840
Get to the cabin!

764
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:37,230
Get to the cabin!

765
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:38,150
Hurry up!

766
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:00,190
Hurry!

767
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:00,940
Thank you.

768
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:09,050
Heaven is truly on my side.

769
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,790
Yuanzhong, quickly stop them!

770
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:12,870
Help!

771
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:14,390
Help!

772
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:16,230
Help!

773
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:20,400
Save me!

774
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:24,670
Help!

775
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:26,790
Help!

776
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:29,750
Help!

777
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:30,710
Help!

778
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:32,070
Help...

779
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:43,510
Don't come any closer.

780
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:45,070
I know you're powerful,

781
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:46,930
but you can't stop me.

782
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:49,030
If you blow this place up, you'll die too!

783
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:51,260
I boarded this ship

784
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:53,830
with no intention of leaving alive.

785
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:56,670
What are you doing?

786
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:57,390
Stop right there!

787
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:00,230
What a magnificent ship!

788
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:01,950
This is all the work

789
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:03,270
of our human craftsmen.

790
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:05,510
If we continue to develop,

791
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:09,190
our race will eventually surpass the immortal race.

792
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:10,220
We will no longer have to

793
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:11,910
live at the mercy of others.

794
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:13,630
But I truly don't understand

795
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:16,750
why you insist on cutting off your own lifeline

796
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:18,630
by switching to spirit stones for power.

797
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:20,630
Who exactly are you?

798
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,310
Who am I?

799
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:25,030
Shen Ying, Mr. Shen,

800
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:26,370
we've met before.

801
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:28,190
Back then, you were full of vigor

802
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:30,310
when you took over the family's ship business.

803
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:31,990
I even drank at your wedding banquet

804
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:33,430
held at the Dengyun Tower.

805
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:35,580
You're a master craftsman?

806
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:39,110
I've once participated in the building

807
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:40,990
of half the Shen family's ships.

808
00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:41,750
But unfortunately,

809
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:43,590
you abandoned the craftsmanship

810
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:45,670
and switched to the immortal race's crystals.

811
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,390
Those ships that once flew through the sky and burrowed underground,

812
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:50,430
making the entire world look at our human race

813
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:52,190
with newfound respect,

814
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:54,310
have all been reduced to ashes.

815
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,070
In the war between gods and demons,

816
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:57,510
the majority of those

817
00:42:57,670 --> 00:42:59,230
who died were human civilians.

818
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:02,510
When the War Demons and Youhu Clan went to war,

819
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:05,150
it was still us who suffered the most casualties.

820
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:08,510
Just because we are physically weak,

821
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:10,070
have short lifespans,

822
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:12,220
and most of us lack talent for cultivation,

823
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:15,070
we are like wild weeds in the field.

824
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:17,230
We are the easiest to grow

825
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,230
and the easiest to be destroyed.

826
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:21,320
But we

827
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,990
are not completely useless.

828
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:25,280
We have Goddess Wushuang.

829
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,550
We have our craftsmanship.

830
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:27,390
It was she who gave us

831
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:28,790
a new path to survival,

832
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,980
allowing us, with our frail bodies,

833
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:33,190
to harness the power to move mountains and seas.

834
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:34,950
We can protect ourselves,

835
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:35,830
we can defend against enemies,

836
00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:37,350
we can live with dignity.

837
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:38,270
But you all...

838
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:41,750
You've abandoned this path.

839
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:44,710
Why?

840
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:46,820
Why?

841
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:48,280
We haven't abandoned craftsmanship.

842
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:49,070
This is just...

843
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:51,190
A temporary measure.

844
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:52,220
At this time,

845
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:53,710
you still want to deceive me?

846
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:54,440
Don't be rash.

847
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,590
Don't come any closer!

848
00:43:56,350 --> 00:43:58,150
You're cutting off your own path to survival,

849
00:43:58,350 --> 00:44:00,870
handing over the great situation

850
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:02,190
created by our predecessors.

851
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:03,360
This is betrayal!
