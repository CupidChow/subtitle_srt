[A Moment But Forever]

00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:47,229
[Episode 13]

3
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,710
Excuse me, you two.

4
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,000
How rude.

5
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:35,590
They didn't even greet me.

6
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:55,700
I'm back.

7
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,150
Thank you for your hard work.

8
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,190
Why don't we invite them over

9
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,470
to have roast goose together?

10
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:03,250
It wasn't really hard work.

11
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:06,070
I just couldn't buy any roast goose.

12
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,190
Couldn't get any?

13
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:10,430
I bought a live goose.

14
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,190
Why don't we roast it ourselves?

15
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:13,670
How do we roast it?

16
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:15,630
How to roast it?

17
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,460
Isn't it simple? We use fire to roast it.

18
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:19,460
Don't run!

19
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:21,390
Stop running!

20
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,590
Where are you running to?

21
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:25,710
Still running?

22
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,150
I thought you were really capable.

23
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,990
Didn't expect that you can't even catch a goose.

24
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:31,550
Isn't this what you said?

25
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,240
A big goose tastes better when stewed whole.

26
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,120
If I hack it down,

27
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,590
won't it become dumpling filling,

28
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,670
with feathers and all?

29
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:37,670
We can't eat that!

30
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,990
Alright then, carry on.

31
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:42,070
What are you doing?

32
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,510
Don't run!

33
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:44,680
I want to eat roast goose.

34
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:46,350
Zi Fei is negotiating with it.

35
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,870
The goose is charging at you!

36
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,630
It scared me.

37
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:03,790
Your legs have healed?

38
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:12,830
They really have healed.

39
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,589
You agreed I could leave or stay as you please.

40
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,550
You can't go back on your word.

41
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:30,560
You're so despicable.

42
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,990
Just to catch a goose,

43
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:33,720
you even used the Divine Left Hand.

44
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,190
Its disadvantage is

45
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,260
it can't speak.

46
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,909
Otherwise, it would have cursed you already.

47
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:38,710
Zi Fei has already

48
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:39,909
negotiated with it.

49
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:41,950
It's just that the goose didn't agree.

50
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,430
Can this even be negotiated?

51
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,060
When I was coming up the mountain earlier,

52
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,350
I met two scholars.

53
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,230
I originally wanted to ask

54
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,110
where to buy roast goose.

55
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:50,710
But those two

56
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:51,870
completely ignored me.

57
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:53,340
Oh, right.

58
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:54,740
Those two have already gone up the mountain.

59
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:55,790
Did you see them?

60
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:00,600
I saw them.

61
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:02,550
But they weren't living people.

62
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:03,430
Those were images

63
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,590
of what happened here before.

64
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,790
Images?

65
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,750
On Baitou Mountain, there's a kind of

66
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,940
special restriction.

67
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:11,350
Whenever the mist spreads,

68
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:13,500
it records fragments of images

69
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,830
from that time.

70
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,950
The images are suddenly released

71
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,470
when there's thunder and lightning.

72
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,620
People walking, lying down, laughing, and arguing…

73
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,110
They're all lifelike.

74
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:24,360
What were those scholars

75
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,990
doing on Baitou Mountain?

76
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:27,560
Because this used to be

77
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,750
a very famous academy.

78
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:29,590
Those who came here

79
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,060
were all students seeking knowledge.

80
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,470
How do you know all this so clearly?

81
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,230
I used to study here too.

82
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:37,420
I've been here

83
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,670
for 60 years.

84
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:39,990
How come I've never seen you before?

85
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:42,990
That was

86
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:44,430
a long time ago.

87
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,670
A long time ago?

88
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:48,870
How old are you?

89
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,390
Send this letter back to the clan.

90
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:05,750
Have Baili Xiang investigate

91
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,950
when Baitou Mountain ever had

92
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:07,950
such an academy,

93
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:08,910
who taught there,

94
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,360
and what students were educated there.

95
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,150
Will Baili Xiang listen to you?

96
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:13,750
He's eager

97
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,230
to do something for me now.

98
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,590
Just go ahead and send it back.

99
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:18,430
Alright, that's easy. I'll take care of it.

100
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:34,070
Have we

101
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,430
known each other for a long time?

102
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,750
Sir, your tea.

103
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:47,470
Please enjoy.

104
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:48,190
Thank you.

105
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,350
This is the Juque Sword.

106
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:12,750
Yes.

107
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,420
Why did you have it?

108
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,000
I found it.

109
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19,750
Why were you looking for it?

110
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:29,550
It has saved me many times over the years.

111
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,430
It's truly a fine sword.

112
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,179
But it's not as

113
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,390
powerful as you said.

114
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:36,230
It's just sharp, that's all.

115
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:39,750
Why are you giving it to me?

116
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:41,710
It was meant for you in the first place.

117
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:55,840
Who are you really?

118
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:57,910
Sixty years ago,

119
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:02,000
at the foot of Guizang Mountain in Yaoguang County, Baicheng Prefecture,

120
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,580
I saw you for the first time.

121
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,430
I was 17 that year.

122
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,670
Thinking my saber skills were perfected,

123
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,300
I left home to wander the martial world.

124
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,430
I was determined to find

125
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:19,790
an equally matched opponent.

126
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:22,510
Unexpectedly,

127
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,910
I was defeated by you in one move.

128
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:27,990
I was furious,

129
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,190
so I clung to you.

130
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:32,210
I was truly ignorant of my own limitations.

131
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:34,750
This is really delicious.

132
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,470
Try some.

133
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:36,590
I'll try some.

134
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,600
Miss, your tea.

135
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,550
Enjoy.

136
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:48,950
Thank you.

137
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,590
Later, at the estate in Minzhou,

138
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:58,190
I found you again.

139
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:00,510
You were injured,

140
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,870
lying on the riverbank.

141
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,670
It snowed heavily that day.

142
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:07,360
My saber was frozen cold.

143
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:14,030
But I saw you again.

144
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:15,870
I was very happy.

145
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:46,150
I took you

146
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:47,550
to a nearby estate to recover.

147
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,630
You acknowledged my kindness

148
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:52,710
and taught me saber techniques in your spare time.

149
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,950
Although you weren't talkative,

150
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:56,910
I was truly happy

151
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,960
during that time.

152
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,950
Your wounds healed day by day.

153
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,190
I knew you would leave,

154
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:08,870
but I didn't expect it to be so soon.

155
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:20,310
I didn't know where to find you.

156
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:21,910
I didn't even know

157
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:22,840
your name.

158
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,270
I only knew about this sword.

159
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:26,630
I knew

160
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,310
you needed to find this sword.

161
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:31,830
I went to many places

162
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:33,110
and searched for many years.

163
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:36,070
I finally found this sword.

164
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:38,710
But I didn't know

165
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:39,910
how to give it to you.

166
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:42,030
So I went to look for you again.

167
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:46,830
Time flew by so fast.

168
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,240
When I saw you again,

169
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,260
more than 20 years had passed.

170
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:04,550
Only then did I realize

171
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:07,350
that the one I liked was an immortal.

172
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,510
No wonder he could

173
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:10,830
break through my saber technique with one sword strike.

174
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,550
No wonder his wounds

175
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,190
healed so quickly.

176
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,990
It turned out he wasn't human.

177
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:22,150
It made sense.

178
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,440
It was such a simple thing,

179
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,110
yet it took me so many years

180
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,350
to understand.

181
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,790
I'm so stupid.

182
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:33,430
Why didn't you call out to me back then?

183
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:36,270
I've heard that the immortals of the Youhu Clan

184
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,470
have long lifespans.

185
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:39,950
Even without practicing any immortal techniques,

186
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,140
they can easily

187
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,550
live for several hundred years.

188
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,540
You're in your prime, Sir.

189
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:46,710
You probably don't know

190
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,240
what aging is like.

191
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:52,710
It's like

192
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:55,270
teeth falling out,

193
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:56,940
skin sagging,

194
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:00,320
ears going deaf, eyes blurring, and back hunching,

195
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:04,350
gradually losing the sense of taste,

196
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:05,910
unable to distinguish near from far,

197
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:08,240
memory slowly fading.

198
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,310
and unable to lift a knife or hold a sword anymore.

199
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,390
Every breath will feel

200
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,030
like there's a huge rock

201
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,720
pressing on your chest.

202
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:20,150
Every moment, you can feel

203
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:22,350
your body dying.

204
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:28,550
You don't know, do you?

205
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:30,550
This is aging.

206
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,590
It's irreversible,

207
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,990
growing older day by day.

208
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,990
I know everyone is different.

209
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,310
The divine race rules the Six Realms,

210
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:45,270
the War Demons are stronger than the Youhu Clan,

211
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:47,710
and the Youhu Clan lives longer than humans.

212
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:48,550
But we humans

213
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,990
are not entirely useless.

214
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:51,310
We are numerous

215
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,750
and can reproduce more easily.

216
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:53,830
We are intelligent

217
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:54,980
with dexterous hands.

218
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:57,030
Compared to livestock and wild beasts,

219
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,430
we are much stronger.

220
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,030
Many humans

221
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:02,110
envy the divine race's longevity

222
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:04,710
and the immortal race's ability to fly and traverse the earth.

223
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,310
But I didn't.

224
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:08,550
I thought I was detached

225
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,060
and clear-headed,

226
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,630
but at that moment,

227
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,670
the moment I saw you again,

228
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:18,390
I suddenly felt an overwhelming

229
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,430
hatred for myself.

230
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,910
I hated being human,

231
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,630
hated being so old and ugly,

232
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,360
hated my foolish delusions,

233
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,430
and my overestimation of myself.

234
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:31,110
Can you understand this feeling?

235
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:35,550
I couldn't face you.

236
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:37,430
I didn't dare to face you,

237
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:39,740
but I didn't want to leave either.

238
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,270
I found a town at the foot of the mountain

239
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:43,270
and settled down there.

240
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:45,710
It was next to Fangwai Mountain.

241
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,630
Occasionally, you would come down,

242
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:49,430
sometimes alone,

243
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,790
sometimes with attendants.

244
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:53,110
I knew you were doing well.

245
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:54,510
Time passed,

246
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:55,790
day by day.

247
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:57,950
You never changed,

248
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:58,900
but I...

249
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:01,470
I was about to die.

250
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:03,510
♫I gaze into your deep eyes♫

251
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:08,730
♫For whom do you take apart the word "love"?♫

252
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,910
Ten years ago, when my time was almost up,

253
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:09,670
I wanted to go home one last time.

254
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,510
On the way, I encountered heavy rain

255
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:14,230
♫Turning around, it's like a dream♫

256
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:14,510
and found a temple

257
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:15,620
to take shelter.

258
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:20,000
♫I have betrayed deep love♫

259
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,430
People say the gods have disappeared,

260
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:25,230
♫Heaving a long, helpless sigh♫

261
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,070
but when I saw

262
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:30,180
♫Time flies too rapidly♫

263
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:28,470
that statue of the goddess,

264
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:31,230
I felt she was alive.

265
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:33,550
So,

266
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:36,230
♫Life is like a flying bird♫

267
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:35,950
I asked her a question.

268
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:42,550
♫Joining, scattering, no way back♫

269
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:38,320
The question

270
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:39,710
was…

271
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:41,150
I asked her,

272
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:43,630
"They say gods love all beings,

273
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:46,670
♫Unable to get what I yearn for, I sink in sadness♫

274
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:46,710
but why aren't all beings equal?"

275
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:48,120
Did she answer you?

276
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:52,170
♫When I brush past love, fate is set♫

277
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:50,730
Yes, she did.

278
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,230
What did she say?

279
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:56,080
♫I've used up my brush and ink♫

280
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,150
She asked me...

281
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,830
♫I couldn't describe♫

282
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:00,270
"Do you want to change all this?"

283
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:04,120
♫This lovesick path with you♫

284
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,340
♫After the farewell, where are you now?♫

285
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:09,270
♫Who do you spend your days with?♫

286
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,430
That beam of light

287
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,940
gradually enveloped me.

288
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:11,390
I regained my former youth.

289
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:14,360
♫Do you know I'm willing to wait for you until the end?♫

290
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:15,350
Later, I went to Fangwai Mountain.

291
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:18,270
♫Sighing that the world is too lonely♫

292
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,350
After that, nothing else mattered.

293
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,740
♫They laugh at me for being foolish♫

294
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,630
What I want to say

295
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:25,690
♫Longing is in my song; the people are not as before♫

296
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:22,880
has all been said.

297
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,870
I use a saber,

298
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:27,190
so I'll leave this sword to you.

299
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:30,840
♫Can't get what I yearn for, I sink in sadness♫

300
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:29,460
Since you went up the mountain,

301
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:30,950
why didn't you come to see me?

302
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,270
Were you very disappointed in me?

303
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:36,340
♫When I brush past love fate is set♫

304
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:35,790
You never promised me anything.

305
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,950
You're an immortal with a long lifespan.

306
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:40,190
♫I've used up my brush and ink♫

307
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,030
So many people

308

have passed through your life.

309

♫I couldn't describe♫

310
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,910
You can't possibly remember them all.

311

It's not your fault.

♫This lovesick path with you♫

313
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,550
But I wasted my entire life,

314
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,390

♫Who do you spend your days with?♫

318
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,110
I neglected my family and friends,

319

and neglected myself too.

♫Do you know I'm willing to wait for you until the end?♫

321

disappointed in myself, that's all.

323
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:59,710

You've come to disturb me again.

340

What are you doing here?

341
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:18,830
This is a memory lamp made by Lei Shi.

342
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:19,790
It can release

343
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:20,440
images of what

344
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,590
happened here before.

345
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,670
I suspect the formation's core is here.

346
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:25,350
Look.

347
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,540
Let's go in and take a look.

348
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:52,430
[Human Race, Xie You]

349
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:08,590
What's wrong?

350
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:11,950
The lamp went out.

351
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:12,950
Just now, we walked

352
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:14,190
too slowly,

353
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,910
so for a long time,

354
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:17,190
there wasn't enough friction to power it.

355
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,910
It automatically turned off.

356
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:23,500
See,

357
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,060
it's lit up again, isn't it?

358
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,480
Are you scared?

359
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:33,310
Don't be ridiculous.

360
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,580
What do I have to be afraid of?

361
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,110
This is called the Thousand Mechanism Door,

362
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,190
also known as the Eight Trigrams Door.

363
00:21:59,310 --> 00:21:59,950
The bricks

364
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:01,630
are the key to opening this door.

365
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:02,910
Only by correctly arranging

366
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:03,790
all the bricks on it

367
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,470
can this door be opened.

368
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:07,750
Do you have a way to open it?

369
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,510
Of course.

370
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,590
If you have the way to open the door,

371
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,110
why didn't you say so earlier?

372
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,190
I saw you studying it for a while,

373
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:36,430
so I thought you knew.

374
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:41,910
Let's go in.

375
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:26,430
What is this?

376
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,030
This is a test.

377
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,530
It asks for a pattern.

378
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:32,830
Its size should be equal to a given circle.

379
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:35,270
You seem quite familiar with this place.

380
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:37,350
I used to study here in the past.

381
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:39,270
Before officially entering the mountain to become a student,

382
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:40,550
I was tested here.

383
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:41,870
This is the first question.

384
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:43,950
If I'm not mistaken,

385
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:45,270
the restriction on Baitou Mountain

386
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:46,930
should have been set by my master.

387
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,020
This restriction is quite powerful.

388
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:51,530
The spellcasting is also extremely sophisticated.

389
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:53,430
Even I can't break it immediately.

390
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:55,230
Your master is this skilled?

391
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,260
Of course.

392
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,800
My master is incredibly powerful.

393
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,920
He knew everything, from astronomy to geography.

394
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:01,190
These restrictions are nothing

395
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,470
to him at all.

396
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,630
I can't tell at all.

397
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,870
Then please take a closer look.

398
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:15,190
Why did this door close?

399
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:16,670
It's alright.

400
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,910
As long as we answer the question correctly,

401
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:19,200
it will open automatically.

402
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,750
We can then

403
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,030
directly enter to the next level.

404
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:22,510
What if we can't answer it?

405
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:24,550
That door will appear again,

406
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:26,630
but it won't lead to the second level.

407
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:28,070
Instead, it will take us back to the starting point.

408
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,670
So,

409
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:31,150
this door will lead to different places

410
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:32,400
based on the results

411
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:34,030
of the test?

412
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,060
That's right.

413
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:54,960
You can't solve it?

414
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:56,590
I can.

415
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:57,860
You can ask me.

416
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:32,150
Yuanzhong!

417
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,340
Hallucination?

418
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,580
Yuanzhong.

419
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:44,910
Are you afraid?

420
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,750
Whether you succeed or fail,

421
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:48,710
you are a hero of our clan.

422
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:49,790
But if you run,

423
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,670
you will die.

424
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:01,760
How could this happen?

425
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:03,870
Will you go voluntarily,

426
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:05,550
or should I have someone help you?

427
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:07,430
Guards!

428
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:08,350
-Yes.
-Yes.

429
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,350
Let me go!

430
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:12,070
Let go!

431
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:13,350
Let me go!

432
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:18,740
Father, save me!

433
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:22,300
Who dares to hurt my son?

434
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:24,350
Dingxu,

435
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:27,230
you're tyrannical and cruel to your own people.

436
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:28,990
You have no ability yourself,

437
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:30,990
so you force these children to go to their deaths.

438
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:33,350
You're utterly shameless.

439
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,540
What I'm doing

440
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,910
is all for the Youhu Clan.

441
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:39,480
Now, the War Demons are unstoppable,

442
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,950
our clan is in grave danger.

443
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:43,150
If we can't obtain the Divine Left Hand,

444
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:44,270
our clan will eventually be destroyed

445
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,510
by the War Demons.

446
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:47,310
Rather than waiting for slaughter,

447
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:49,020
we might as well take a chance.

448
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:50,780
If you want to take a chance, you or I can go.

449
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,390
We can't gamble with these

450
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:53,110
children's lives.

451
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:55,270
You're so stubborn.

452
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,140
Seize him!

453
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,870
Yuanzhong, come with me.

454
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:12,390
Yuanzhong, if you leave,

455
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:13,310
have you thought about

456
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:15,030
what will happen to your clansmen?

457
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:18,030
If you can't learn to use the Divine Left Hand,

458
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:19,640
your family and friends,

459
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:21,270
your clansmen,

460
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:22,910
will all die horribly

461
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:24,570
under the blades of the War Demons.

462
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:26,270
You can escape now,

463
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:28,030
but how long can you escape for?

464
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,750
And how far can you go?

465
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,580
Are you going to wait until they're all dead

466
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:35,790
to regret your choice today?

467
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:38,310
You can save them,

468
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:39,790
can't you?

469
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,510
Don't listen to his nonsense.

470
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:45,230
Even if you learn to use the Divine Left Hand,

471
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:46,350
what then?

472
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:49,070
After killing all the War Demons and saving the entire clan,

473
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,980
they'll have no more worries.

474
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,110
Do you think they'll trust you

475
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:54,710
to possess the powerful force

476
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:56,030
of Divine Left Hand?

477
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,750
When the birds are gone, the bow is put away.

478
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:01,810
When the hare is caught, the hound is cooked.

479
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:03,270
When the time comes,

480
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:05,670
they'll scheme against you despicably.

481
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:06,660
They'll seal you away,

482
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:08,290
keep you under house arrest,

483
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,430
and subject you to endless humiliation.

484
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,350
Will you regret it?

485
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:14,880
Yuanzhong,

486
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:16,430
no matter what,

487
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,220
they are your brethren,

488
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:20,270
connected to you by blood.

489
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:26,030
Come.

490
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:28,920
Come with Father.

491
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:51,710
I've finished answering.

492
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:52,950
Let's go to the next level.

493
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:56,910
Yuanzhong.

494
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:01,640
Oh no.

495
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,850
Wake up, Yuanzhong.

496
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:27,180
You're in a hallucination.

497
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,270
A hallucination?

498
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,350
Yes.

499
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:38,390
You're not fighting against anyone

500
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,550
but the fear deep inside your heart.

501
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:42,460
The past cannot be changed.

502
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,750
Whether right or wrong,

503
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,300
it was your own choice.

504
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:46,670
Since you've chosen it,

505
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,290
you must face it bravely.

506
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,190
Escaping is useless.

507
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:04,750
The hallucination looked quite real.

508
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:05,310
Of course.

509
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,620
Otherwise, how could it deceive people?

510
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:15,830
What's this crappy painting?

511
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:17,470
It's the "Angry-Eyed Demon."

512
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:19,190
This should be my master's work.

513
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:20,990
How can it forcibly

514
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:21,960
pull people into a hallucination?

515
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:23,630
The demon's eyes

516
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:24,310
are probably made of

517
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:25,870
a very simple restriction.

518
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,310
It makes people unconsciously

519
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:28,100
think of

520
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,440
what they least want to remember,

521
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,030
mainly fears and desires.

522
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:36,730
What are you doing?

523
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:38,470
Tearing it up, of course.

524
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:39,430
Should I leave it here

525
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:40,430
to harm others?

526
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:40,910
This is my master's

527
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:42,270
tool to test disciples.

528
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:44,190
Although it traps people in hallucinations,

529
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:45,190
it's not fatal.

530
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:46,550
At worst, they'll fall into a deep sleep.

531
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:47,750
You can't destroy it.

532
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,110
What did you see in this painting?

533
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:02,270
I haven't looked at the painting.

534
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:04,910
I came here to solve the puzzle.

535
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:06,470
I don't have time to appreciate art.

536
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:09,030
Finished answering?

537
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:09,870
Yes, finished.

538
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,670
We can go directly to the second level now.

539
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:14,100
Old man,

540
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:16,110
let's see who's really got the skills.

541
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,680
Zi Fei, beat him up.

542
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:29,750
You old geezer,

543
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:30,990
haven't seen you in so many years.

544
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:32,580
I thought you were long dead.

545
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:33,950
Quick question,

546
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:34,990
have you picked out your grave yet?

547
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:35,750
Did you see

548
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:36,540
this auspicious spot of mine

549
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,590
and want to die here?

550
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:39,110
I'll grant your wish today.

551
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:40,270
Mei Shan.

552
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:51,790
Master!

553
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:00,990
What's the background

554
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:02,230
of Ji Tanyin's master?

555
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:03,030
I don't know.

556
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:04,400
Didn't you

557
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,430
fight with him before?

558
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:06,980
You must know something about him.

559
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,660
Yes, I do know something,

560
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:10,590
but

561
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,110
my knowledge is very limited.

562
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:15,150
Tell me about it.

563
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:18,430
Back then, Kai Shan chose this place

564
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:19,430
to seal himself.

565
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:20,470
I was entrusted by Yuanzhong

566
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:22,070
to come here and protect Kai Shan.

567
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:23,670
But I had only been here for a few days

568
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:25,630
when this old guy suddenly showed up.

569
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:27,310
He attacked me without a word.

570
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:29,110
With my temper, how could I tolerate that?

571
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:30,990
So you drove him away?

572
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,010
I was the one who got driven away.

573
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,390
But I fought my way back later.

574
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:41,790
I have to say,

575
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,260
that old guy's swordsmanship

576
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:44,940
was truly terrifying.

577
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:46,910
I was fortunate enough to break through my limitations,

578
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:48,470
and a big part of the reason

579
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:50,430
was because I defeated him

580
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:52,060
and got rid of that frustration.

581
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,110
Later, I fought with him for several years.

582
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:55,230
I had a sudden enlightenment.

583
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,290
When I faced the heavenly tribulation after that,

584
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,510
I obtained divine abilities.

585
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:01,260
My own cultivation also greatly increased.

586
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:02,750
So...

587
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:05,020
You defeated him!

588
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:06,590
No.

589
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:08,910
But if you think about it, I didn't lose either.

590
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:10,310
This seems to have had quite an impact

591
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:10,870
on that old fellow.

592
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:12,110
He never came back after that.

593
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:14,510
Then why do you seem

594
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:16,870
so resentful whenever you see him?

595
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:18,470
Because he looks down on me.

596
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:22,500
Now that you mention it,

597
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:23,430
I feel like he seems to

598
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:24,670
look down on me too.

599
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,920
He does look down on you.

600
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:27,910
Where's Yuanzhong?

601
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:29,670
He went back to his room to sleep.

602
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:31,300
Ji Tanyin has gone off

603
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,510
to curry favor with someone else.

604
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,630
How can he still sleep?

605
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:18,469
Have some water.

606
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:27,909
Ji Tanyin and her master

607
00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:29,170
talked all night.

608
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:32,830
The master and student reunited.

609
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:35,550
It's normal to have a long conversation by candlelight, isn't it?

610
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:37,469
Although it's a master-student relationship,

611
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:41,110
they're still a man and woman alone together.

612
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:52,960
I want to eat milk cake for breakfast.

613
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,270
You know

614
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:57,590
I only know how to make soy milk.

615
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:58,830
Would soy milk and steamed buns be okay?

616
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:00,880
I also want to eat lotus flower with blood duck

617
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:02,130
and drink soft-shelled turtle soup.

618
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:04,230
I don't know how to make those either.

619
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:05,750
Ji Tanyin can make them.

620
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:06,970
Go ask her.

621
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:09,230
Are you sure she can?

622
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:10,860
She's a quick learner.

623
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:26,470
Master.

624
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:28,150
I don't dare to accept such a title.

625
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:30,330
You are already a god.

626
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:31,730
while I am just a mortal.

627
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,350
I can't be your master anymore.

628
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,500
Once a master, always a master.

629
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:38,990
I will always remember

630
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:40,430
the kindness of your teachings.

631
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:41,670
The reason I have

632
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:42,990
achieved what I have today

633
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:43,510
is all because of

634
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:45,060
your constant guidance

635
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,140
and generous teachings.

636
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:47,470
Without your kindness,

637
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:48,930
how can I be where I am today?

638
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:57,350
Are you angry with me, Master?

639
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:05,660
I left without saying goodbye back then.

640
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,240
It was indeed my fault.

641
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:09,590
It was because…

642
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:15,430
Because the process

643
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:16,690
was just too sudden.

644
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:18,100
I ascended to heaven in an instant.

645
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:18,910
I really

646
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:20,230
had no preparation at all.

647
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:22,230
You know me, Master.

648
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:23,670
If I had known beforehand

649
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:25,140
that I would have such good fortune,

650
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:26,190
how could I not have

651
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,630
informed you in advance?

652
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:36,070
You made a heavenly oath?

653
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:39,390
If you break that oath,

654
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:40,910
you will die.

655
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:42,830
Then I just won't break it.

656
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,180
Stand up and speak.

657
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,170
Thank you, Master.

658
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:11,750
Please have some tea, Master.

659
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:17,990
How have you been these past few years, Master?

660
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:18,950
Getting by.

661
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:22,110
Before I knew it,

662
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:23,860
over a thousand years have passed.

663
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:25,190
I never imagined

664
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:26,710
I would meet you again, Master.

665
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:29,750
You mean you didn't expect

666
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:31,550
that I'd still be alive, right?

667
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:32,870
No, that's not it.

668
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:34,630
Of course, as your student, I hope

669
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:35,430
that you will live

670
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:36,750
a long and prosperous life.

671
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:38,950
When I was there,

672
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:40,780
I often prayed for your well-being.

673
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:44,510
Lies.

674
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:45,980
It's true.

675
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,630
I truly wished for you

676
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:48,830
to live a long and prosperous life.

677
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:50,310
Only in this way

678
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:52,340
could I see you again.

679
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:53,990
Praying for me?

680
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:56,030
Often?

681
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:58,500
Not often,

682
00:37:58,870 --> 00:37:59,660
but

683
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:01,670
I still did it occasionally.

684
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:03,550
In any case, I've always

685
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:05,030
remembered you in my heart.

686
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:10,310
Master, have you been using a sword recently?

687
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:12,910
I am now a sword cultivator.

688
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:14,910
You're not studying craftsmanship anymore?

689
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:17,630
I'm slow-witted and have made no progress.

690
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:18,430
I've given up on it.

691
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:19,230
How can that be?

692
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:20,950
Master, you're knowledgeable in both ancient and modern matters.

693
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:22,030
Your talent is unparalleled

694
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:24,750
and your disciples are spread all over the world.

695
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,360
Even after a thousand years,

696
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:28,350
your craftsmanship has been passed down to this day.

697
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:30,060
It's still widely used by many people.

698
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,180
In this world,

699
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:33,850
no one is more skilled than you.

700
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:35,670
If

701
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:37,640
I'm really as good as you say,

702
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:41,030
then why are you the God of Craft?

703
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:42,920
That's because

704
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,150
you don't care about becoming a god.

705
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:45,950
Since you're my master,

706
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:46,880
it proves that you

707
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,170
are even more powerful than gods.

708
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:56,070
I didn't expect

709
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:57,640
for your personality to still be the same

710
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,630
after becoming a god.

711
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:00,430
Not only that,

712
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:02,230
my reverence for you

713
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:03,280
has never changed either.

714
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:06,950
Are you not content being a god?

715
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:08,070
Why come down to the mortal world?

716
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:10,620
To find someone.

717
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:11,580
Who?

718
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,750
Ji Tanyin.

719
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:15,390
Yuanzhong wants to have lotus blood duck,

720
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:16,070
turtle soup,

721
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:17,190
and also milk cake.

722
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:18,710
He wants you to prepare breakfast.

723
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:19,630
Got it!

724
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,470
I'll go prepare breakfast first.

725
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:23,100
I'll catch up with you later, Master.

726
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:40,210
Such a sumptuous breakfast.

727
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:41,720
Miss Ji, thank you for your hard work.

728
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:43,620
It's no trouble. Please, have a seat.

729
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:45,120
Time to eat!

730
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:58,550
Please sit down, Master.

731
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:15,950
According to your past preferences,

732
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,310
I've prepared a few dishes.

733
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:18,270
I'm not sure if your tastes

734
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:19,180
have changed.

735
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:20,330
Please try them.

736
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:21,990
How impressive.

737
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:23,310
After all these years,

738
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:25,360
you still remember my preferences.

739
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:27,500
No matter what,

740
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:29,150
I'll never forget your preferences.

741
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:31,440
Eat.

742
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:35,270
I heard you are

743
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:36,910
the master of my handmaiden.

744
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:38,510
May I ask your name?

745
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:43,070
My master's name is Xie You.

746
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:44,670
He specializes in the art of craftsmanship.

747
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,310
He's the pioneer of mechanical engineering.

748
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:47,580
He's also skilled in water management,

749
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:49,150
casting, and creation.

750
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:50,150
He has taught many

751
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:51,750
renowned master craftsmen.

752
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:54,710
So, may I ask,

753
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:56,830
which famous master craftsmen has he taught?

754
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:58,830
There's Yu Wenjing,

755
00:40:58,830 --> 00:40:59,990
who's an expert in hydraulics.

756
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:01,310
And there's Ma Xian, known for

757
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:02,310
his water-powered automata.

758
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:03,760
They are all my master's disciples.

759
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:05,590
I've never heard of any of them.

760
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:08,470
I guess they're not that famous after all.

761
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:11,950
That just shows how ignorant you are.

762
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,110
If you dare call them famous,

763
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:16,090
then everyone should know their names

764
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,120
and their deeds.

765
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,550
I don't know them,

766
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:21,110
which means they're not that famous yet.

767
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,260
Alright, Yuanzhong.

768
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:26,710
Let's eat.

769
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,250
The soup has such a strong fishy smell.

770
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,510
How can one swallow it?

771
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:46,590
Is it strong?

772
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:48,360
Let me taste it.

773
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:52,920
It's quite fresh.

774
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:55,040
Go make me another bowl.

775
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,280
Didn't you say you wanted to stay with me?

776
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,580
Now I want

777
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:06,230
a new bowl of soup.

778
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:14,550
You're weak and deficient in qi.

779
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,450
Soft-shelled turtle is very cooling.

780
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:17,410
If you eat too much,

781
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:19,300
you'll die even sooner.

782
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:21,350
As for me,

783
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:23,310
I have quite a bit of knowledge in medicine.

784
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:25,030
Observing your appearance,

785
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:26,670
it's like a lamp running out of oil.

786
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,400
When your lungs are deficient and you cough a lot,

787
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,060
and when you have trouble sleeping and many dreams,

788
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:34,660
you two can start arranging his funeral.

789
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:41,930
No need for your concern.

790
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:44,350
I see you're not young either.

791
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:46,380
Who knows which of us

792
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,800
will die first?
