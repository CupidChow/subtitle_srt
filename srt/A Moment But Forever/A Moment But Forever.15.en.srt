[A Moment But Forever]

2
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,320
[Episode 15]

3
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:10,750
Why are you here?

4
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,310
I was worried, so I came to find you.

5
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,350
What's wrong? You look unhappy.

6
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:18,960
Are the books not good?

7
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:24,510
Are you hungry?

8
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,550
No.

9
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,070
You were busy all night yesterday,

10
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,730
and you've been reading all day today.

11
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,150
How could you not be hungry?

12
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,510
Waiter, bring us some roast goose.

13
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,829
Alright, please wait a moment.

14
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,750
I thought they didn't have roast goose here.

15
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,350
I pre-ordered it yesterday.

16
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,150
Thank you.

17
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:41,430
You're welcome.

18
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,150
You're helping me out too.

19
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:46,550
Is the creation of the Linglong House

20
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,030
related to "The Book of Calming?"

21
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:49,329
What?

22
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,350
Not even remotely related.

23
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:53,030
No connection at all.

24
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,390
Then why did you buy these books?

25
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,590
None of your business.

26
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,460
How come the gambling game

27
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:10,910
has turned into a music show?

28
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:12,470
A few days ago, Mei Shan

29
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:13,940
got some attitude from your master,

30
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,030
and he took it out on those gamblers.

31
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,150
I doubt anyone here

32
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:17,700
will dare

33
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,829
to gamble again.

34
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,430
Your dishes are all here.

35
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,190
Please enjoy.

36
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,840
Does time really not exist?

37
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,390
Still thinking about that?

38
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,190
Time indeed doesn't exist.

39
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,090
It's just a concept.

40
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,110
If time doesn't exist,

41
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,579
what's the meaning of living?

42
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:52,630
Although time isn't real,

43
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:54,710
the chess game we played,

44
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:55,860
the wine we drank,

45
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,030
and the conversations we had—

46
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,410
they all really happened.

47
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:01,310
So?

48
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,390
So,

49
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,030
what matters most in life

50
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,200
is the moments and experiences.

51
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:13,390
♫Lost in the mortal world♫

52
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:22,390
♫Love and hate come and go♫

53
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:31,590
♫Drunk in foolish dreams♫

54
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:39,470
♫Cold or warm, only you will know♫

55
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:44,790
Those lyrics are quite interesting.

56
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,380
What's interesting about them?

57
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:49,590
They're about life and death.

58
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:50,950
Did you not get that?

59
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,030
People of the Youhu Clan

60
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,070
live a very long time.

61
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,870
How can you understand

62
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,110
the life and death of mortals?

63
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,110
Why does that sound

64
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,110
so bitter?

65
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:02,590
I'm not bitter.

66
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,350
The meaning of life doesn't lie in how long it lasts.

67
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,550
Immortals live for thousands of years,

68
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:10,990
yet most of them spend their days cultivating in solitude.

69
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:13,190
Meanwhile, mayflies live for only a day,

70
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,270
but they experience birth, aging, sickness, and death.

71
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,320
They know how to reproduce and sustain life.

72
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:19,500
They too have their own

73
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,550
love, hate, and heartbreak.

74
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:22,950
So whether you live for 1,000 years

75
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,270
or just a single day,

76
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,470
what matters most is living the life you want

77
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,070
and feeling content and at ease.

78
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,990
Are you going to say time doesn't exist again?

79
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:32,630
You're too fixated on it.

80
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,180
As long as you're happy,

81
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,030
why get hung up on the passing of time?

82
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,420
So,

83
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:39,870
you're not afraid of death?

84
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:40,510
I am.

85
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,950
But fear won't change anything.

86
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,230
I have to accept it.

87
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,470
Greed has no limits,

88
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:48,970
so don't obsess over life's length.

89
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,100
Just like that song says,

90
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:52,710
even if this life

91
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,230
only holds a fleeting moment of joy,

92
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:55,750
remembering that feeling

93
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,040
is enough.

94
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,790
But the joy in that song

95
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,790
seems to be about romantic love.

96
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:03,710
Romantic love,

97
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:04,910
obsessions,

98
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:06,070
or cravings…

99
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,350
It depends on

100
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:08,750
each person's understanding of joy.

101
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:11,310
What if someone gets that joy,

102
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,750
but after experiencing it,

103
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,430
they no longer want to live?

104
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,630
Wouldn't that be a pity?

105
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:20,800
Then you'll have to ask

106
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,790
that person.

107
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,230
What feels like a pity to you

108
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,670
might not be a pity to them.

109
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:35,710
I'm heading back.

110
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,190
Sit back.

111
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:39,470
Finish eating before you leave.

112
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:41,600
Wasting food is not a good habit.

113
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:47,830
Why are you back?

114
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:48,580
I thought you had left

115
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:49,750
for good.

116
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,390
What?

117
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,230
Why are you afraid of him?

118
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:53,430
Hey, old man, I'm talking to you.

119
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:54,230
Can't you hear me?

120
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:58,430
Master.

121
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,030
You're back.

122
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,950
I have something to ask you.

123
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,040
Wait a moment.

124
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:05,800
I need to talk to him.

125
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,910
High Priest,

126
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:14,790
my disciple seems to care a lot about you.

127
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:17,750
Oh, right.

128
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,070
Since we met,

129
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,710
I haven't given you any gifts.

130
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:21,740
Gifts?

131
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,430
Yuanzhong, Yuanzhong!

132
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:49,700
After taking my medicine,

133
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:50,830
he'll be fine in three to five days.

134
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,310
What a jerk!

135
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:54,710
He caught Yuanzhong off guard.

136
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:55,630
So despicable.

137
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,030
I curse him with a miserable death.

138
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,310
Don't say that.

139
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,390
Fine.

140
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,710
Then what should I say?

141
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,710
Master, the tea is ready.

142
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,670
I don't understand.

143
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:08,670
Why did you hurt Yuanzhong?

144
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:09,950
You're concerned for him?

145
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,390
I'm not.

146
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:15,590
I hit him to avenge you.

147
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:17,110
Avenge me?

148
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,630
60 years ago, during the Battle of Pinghu,

149
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:22,750
a mysterious girl

150
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,150
appeared on the battlefield.

151
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,450
She was attacked by Yuanzhong

152
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,710
and then sank into the sea

153
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,150
along with Pinghu Xianzhou.

154
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:30,430
That was you, right?

155
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,550
He hurt you back then,

156
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,870
so he deserved that strike.

157
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:40,910
Besides, I wanted to test him

158
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,670
to see if he's truly worthy…

159
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,430
of being with you.

160
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:47,320
After all,

161
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,830
my most beloved disciple

162
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:50,230
is no longer a mortal.

163
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:53,430
I'm not as good

164
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:54,190
as you say, Master.

165
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,780
There are still many things

166
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:56,790
I don't understand,

167
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,390
and I can't be free of doubts.

168
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,470
Tell me.

169
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,670
What is it that you don't understand?

170
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,270
The four numbers you left behind,

171
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:12,900
no matter which version I checked,

172
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,310
all point to a line

173
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:15,110
from "The Book of Calming."

174
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:16,480
What line?

175
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:19,910
"Shooting stars shine brilliantly. Even if they burn out, there's no regret."

176
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:22,750
This line has another meaning:

177
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:26,470
"If one learns the Way in the morning, one can die without regret by evening."

178
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,350
I knew it.

179
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,280
I couldn't hide it from you.

180
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:43,110
In this life,

181
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:44,790
I once prided myself on my craftsmanship.

182
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,310
I believed that no one in this world

183
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,470
could surpass me.

184
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:51,550
When I met you,

185
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,830
I knew right away you were gifted

186
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:54,470
and thought you were

187
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:56,030
the one chosen by heaven to inherit my skills.

188
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:57,600
I wanted to take you as my disciple

189
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,300
and teach you everything I knew.

190
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,900
But I was too narrow-minded.

191
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,430
You truly were the chosen one,

192
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:07,590
but what you were meant to inherit

193
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:09,740
was far greater than my humble craft.

194
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:10,950
Master…

195
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:15,830
Seeing you bring

196
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:16,950
my Linglong House design

197
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,470
to life

198
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,150
and ascend to godhood because of it...

199
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:23,600
The whole thing

200
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,390
left me feeling down

201
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,390
for quite a while.

202
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,110
I started doubting my path

203
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:30,790
and all the effort

204
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:33,010
I had poured into my craftsmanship.

205
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:37,860
If craftsmanship

206
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,990
was truly my destined path,

207
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:42,470
then why was it you

208
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,900
who became a god and not me?

209
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:53,910
For the next few hundred years,

210
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,590
I put aside my craftsmanship,

211
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,390
traveled far and wide,

212
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:58,610
and turned to swordsmanship instead.

213
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:01,950
By the grace of heaven, I was gifted

214
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:03,510
and made some achievements.

215
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:07,280
But I always felt like

216
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,900
something was missing.

217
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:14,740
One day,

218
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:16,350
I stumbled upon a remote village

219
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,110
and saw an old carpenter

220
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,350
making tables and chairs.

221
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,660
He neither knew how to select materials

222
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:24,270
nor had refined skills.

223
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,470
But I stayed there,

224
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:30,830
quietly watching him for an entire day.

225
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:35,270
I watched him slowly turn planks of wood

226
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:37,990
into tables and chairs.

227
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:42,910
In that moment, I finally understood

228
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:46,630
how much I loved craftsmanship.

229
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,750
Cultivation and immortality

230
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,260
meant nothing to me.

231
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,030
Only craftsmanship

232
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,510
could bring me joy.

233
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:59,510
This kind of joy is small,

234
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:02,110
and there's no need for others to understand it.

235
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,630
That simple joy

236
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:04,950
you're talking about,

237
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:07,510
I've felt it too from time to time.

238
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:13,150
After that, I returned here,

239
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,990
turned my four unresolved questions

240
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:16,310
into four seals,

241
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:17,910
and sealed Yingong Mountain.

242
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,190
I understand now.

243
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,270
What you sealed wasn't just a mountain.

244
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,510
You also sealed

245
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:27,830
the passion for craftsmanship that you once had

246
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,540
when you first began teaching.

247
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,390
You sealed that chapter of your life

248
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:32,790
and your mindset back then.

249
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:37,630
Exactly. That's it.

250
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:42,790
I knew it.

251
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:46,910
Only you can understand me.

252
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:09,990
Now, of the four questions,

253
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:11,460
you've solved three.

254
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,630
Once you unravel the mystery of the Linglong House,

255
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:15,350
I'll have no regrets left.

256
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,310
Tanyin, on the last question,

257
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,230
I hope you can enlighten me.

258
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,510
But Master, you haven't become a god.

259
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,910
You've lived for 1,000 years as a mortal

260
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,120
because of

261
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,310
that unwavering obsession.

262
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:30,550
If I were to

263
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:31,910
resolve that obsession,

264
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:33,470
I fear you might

265
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:35,960
perish in an instant.

266
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,860
"If one learns the Way in the morning, one can die without regret by evening."

267
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,390
If one carries

268
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:45,150
unanswered doubts in their heart,

269
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,070
life can lose its spark.

270
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:48,760
You're a craftsman.

271
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:51,830
Please, fulfill my wish.

272
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,590
Master, don't…

273
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:59,510
The more capable one is the master.

274
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:01,720
These four questions are your lessons to me.

275
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:02,560
So at this moment,

276
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,690
you are my master.

277
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,030
I offer you my respect.

278
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:23,630
Alright.

279
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,670
I know what you want now.

280
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:31,670
I'll take

281
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:35,230
this cup of tea.

282
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:57,430
Once my master, always my master.

283
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,110
You're my master

284
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:02,670
and always will be.

00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:18,060

Brilliant!

310
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,100
That's how it works.

311
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,110
Sir.

312
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,270
Come in and take a break.

313
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,670
Have some freshly steamed pork buns

314
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:55,150
and a pot of

315
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:56,590
hot purple bamboo shoot tea.

316
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,510
You'll feel refreshed.

317
00:20:58,350 --> 00:20:59,150
Waiter,

318
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:01,060
is that Baitou Mountain?

319
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,030
Yes.

320
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:15,610
Kai Shan.

321
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,240
[Kai Shan, a weapon spirit]

322
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:17,830
Food.

323
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:18,710
Where's the food?

324
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,390
The kitchen is over there.

325
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,670
There are some leftovers.

326
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:27,390
Does he even need to eat?

327
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:30,310
Other people eat to fill their stomachs,

328
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:31,870
but Kai Shan?

329
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:33,670
He eats purely for the pleasure of it.

330
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,060
What's wrong with you?

331
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:26,790
These dishes smell amazing.

332
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:28,030
Come on, eat up.

333
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:28,770
Delicious.

334
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:31,590
Come and eat.

335
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:32,630
They'll get cold soon.

336
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:34,070
You guys go ahead and eat.

337
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:35,350
I'll go get some wine.

338
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:36,910
Where's that old man?

339
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:38,070
Isn't he coming to join us?

340
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:41,950
No need to wait for him.

341
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:44,440
Master has passed away.

342
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:47,870
He's dead?

343
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:49,760
Master lived for a long time.

344
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:52,140
The only reason he was still alive

345
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:53,790
was because in his heart

346
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:54,910
there were unresolved questions.

347
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:56,770
Once I solved those four restriction questions,

348
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:58,550
his wish was fulfilled,

349
00:22:58,870 --> 00:22:59,870
and he left this world.

350
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:17,910
Are you alright?

351
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:21,990
I'm fine.

352
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:26,780
I'm sorry for your loss,

353
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,360
but we all have to die someday.

354
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,500
It's just a matter of time.

355
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:32,870
So,

356
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:34,790
don't be too sad.

357
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:37,030
I'm not sad.

358
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:40,670
Master was a proud man.

359
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,870
He never cared much about life and death.

360
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:44,710
He was not able to

361
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:46,110
ascend to godhood.

362
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:46,950
But even if he could,

363
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:49,630
he probably wouldn't have deigned to do so.

364
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,910
A long life without desire or purpose

365
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:54,470
would've meant

366
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:57,150
nothing but suffering and loneliness for him.

367
00:23:58,630 --> 00:23:59,430
Are you really okay?

368
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:03,470
I understand everything,

369
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:06,630
but it's still

370
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,390
a bit hard for me to accept it.

371
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,150
Yuanzhong.

372
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:14,710
Yuanzhong.

373
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:18,390
Yuanzhong.

374
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:21,870
Yuanzhong.

375
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:27,190
Congratulations

376
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:29,190
on breaking the seal on Kai Shan.

377
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:31,750
It is worth celebrating.

378
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:33,150
But without you here

379
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:34,550
haunting me like a ghost,

380
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,390
I would be happier.

381
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:44,390
What is this?

382
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:48,020
It's a divine sword forged by the Sword God, Ouye Zi.

383
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,320
It's called the Juque Sword.

384
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,470
So this is the Juque Sword.

385
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,460
Remember when we were kids?

386
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:54,870
We learned swordsmanship together

387
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:55,830
under your father's guidance.

388
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:58,680
He said there was a human master

389
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:01,120
who ascended to godhood through the art of sword forging.

390
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:03,710
He forged five swords while in the Mortal Realm,

391
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:05,670
and the Juque Sword was one of them.

392
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:07,150
This sword is incredibly sharp

393
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:08,030
and capable of cutting through

394
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:09,310
anything in this world.

395
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:12,670
During the years you were sealed,

396
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:15,350
I felt guilty for failing you

397
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:17,390
but didn't know how to save you.

398
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,120
So I wandered among humans,

399
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:20,430
searching for this sword.

400
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,000
I hoped its unmatched sharpness

401
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,060
could sever your golden hoop.

402
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,430
Unfortunately, after more than a decade,

403
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:29,100
I still couldn't find it.

404
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:31,500
It wasn't until a few days ago

405
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:32,790
that I finally got this sword

406
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:34,590
from another old friend

407
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,350
whom I had let down.

408
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:40,580
What exactly are you trying to say?

409
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:42,670
I want to apologize to you.

410
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:44,190
You've already apologized.

411
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:45,830
It's different this time.

412
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:47,710
When I apologized before,

413
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:50,190
I was hoping for your forgiveness,

414
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:52,270
hoping you'd understand my reasons.

415
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:54,430
But recently, I met someone

416
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:56,030
who made me realize

417
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:58,830
that what's done is done.

418
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:00,590
There's no use in regretting it.

419
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,750
Nor can I change the past.

420
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:04,990
An apology that demands forgiveness

421
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:06,350
is not a sincere apology.

422
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:08,190
I still owe you

423
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:09,200
a sincere apology.

424
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:16,870
Yuanzhong.

425
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:18,950
We grew up together.

426
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:20,910
I've always seen you as my brother.

427
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:24,030
When your parents were killed,

428
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,550
I knew the truth,

429
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:28,750
yet I kept it from you.

430
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:31,190
Otherwise, you wouldn't have been set up

431
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:33,310
and imprisoned for decades.

432
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,030
That was my fault.

433
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,680
I failed you.

434
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,050
Whether you forgive me or not,

435
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:42,510
I'll always see you as my brother,

436
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:44,010
respect you,

437
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:45,680
and follow you.

438
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,990
I hope that one day

439
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,270
I can make up for my mistake.

440
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:10,190
I'll take my leave.

441
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:14,270
Stop.

442
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:22,710
Take your sword.

443
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:25,870
You rambled on and on,

444
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:27,550
but I still have no idea what you're trying to say.

445
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:29,630
You're still as chatty

446
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:30,510
as you were as a kid.

447
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,020
Where are you heading next?

448
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:36,830
Yandu.

449
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:38,990
I suspect the War Demons

450
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,390
have received help from the human race.

451
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,620
Otherwise, there's no way

452
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,720
they could've stayed hidden all these years

453
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:44,110
without us finding a trace.

454
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,470
I'm going to Yandu to investigate.

455
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:47,950
It's you who found nothing.

456
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:49,440
I've known for a while

457
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,710
that the War Demons are still alive.

458
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:53,350
Chiyi and Xiazhi are recovering in Yandu.

459
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:55,030
You can go find them first.

460
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:58,070
Chiyi and Xiazhi?

461
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:01,070
I thought they were dead.

462
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:01,870
They didn't die.

463
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,820
Zi Fei saved their lives.

464
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,060
Don't look at me like that.

465
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:11,880
And stop following me around.

466
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,150
Just focus on your own duties.

467
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:16,350
After all, you're the Commander of the War Division.

468
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:17,580
If you

469
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,920
let Baili Xiang

470
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,670
take your power so easily again,

471
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:22,030
don't say you know me.

472
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,060
You sounded so sincere.

473
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:45,270
I was listening outside the window,

474
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,430
and I nearly fell for it.

475
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:49,150
I just wanted to get rid of him.

476
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,340
It annoys me

477
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,340
to see him around.

478
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,230
So you were acting?

479
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:55,630
You asked me to look into

480
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:57,300
Baitou Mountain. I've got something.

481
00:28:58,150 --> 00:28:59,350
During the Yu dynasty of the human race,

482
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:00,820
this place was called Yingong Mountain.

483
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:01,940
But that was

484
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,260
over 1000 years ago.

485
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:05,150
According to records, Xie You was very famous back then,

486
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:06,590
which matches what Ji Tanyin said.

487
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:08,000
He once taught

488
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,710
two highly respected students.

489
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:11,430
You must have heard of one of them,

490
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:12,790
though I doubt you can guess who it is.

491
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:14,030
Who is it?

492
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,470
Goddess Wushuang,

493
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:17,710
who ascended to godhood a long time ago.

494
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,740
Goddess Wushuang was Xie You's student?

495
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:23,050
The other one is known as the Mute Lady of Wu Mountain.

496
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:23,950
Although she hasn't become a god,

497
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:25,070
she has quite a reputation

498
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:25,870
among humans.

499
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:28,150
We go way back with her.

500
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:29,190
During the Battle of Pinghu,

501
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:30,390
the girl who took a hit from you

502
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:31,190
was her.

503
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:45,100
Ji Tanyin's craftsmanship is impressive too.

504
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,870
Could she be the Mute Lady of Wu Mountain?

505
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,090
It's possible.

506
00:29:58,870 --> 00:29:59,660
Yuanzhong.

507
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:02,430
All good things must come to an end.

508
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:03,870
Indeed.

509
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:04,750
What about you?

510
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,030
What's your plan next?

511
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:07,470
I've counted the days.

512
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,550
My next tribulation

513
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:09,410
is coming.

514
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,190
The restriction here is gone.

515
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,860
I need to find another place to face my tribulation.

516
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:14,270
Otherwise, the whole Baitou Mountain

517
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,710
would be reduced to rubble.

518
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:16,910
Alright.

519
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,230
Once you've chosen a place,

520
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,750
send your paper messenger to let me know.

521
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:20,670
Don't worry.

522
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:22,230
I will.

523
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:26,200
By the way, Tanghua said

524
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,560
he's waiting for you at the foot of the mountain.

525
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,730
Didn't he leave already?

526
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:33,850
Where are we going next?

527
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:59,150
Tanyin.

528
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:00,630
Tanyin.

529
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:02,700
It's Hannv.

530
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:14,430
These are the clues Zi Fei

531
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:15,470
has collected over the years.

532
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,720
They might help you find

533
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,630
the War Demons.

534
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:29,710
Just as I suspected.

535
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:31,070
What are your plans?

536
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:32,990
I'll first go to Orange Lake

537
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:34,580
to break Lu Chen's seal.

538
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:36,150
After that,

539
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:37,870
I'll also make a trip to Yandu.

540
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:38,510
Alright.

541
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:39,670
I'll go there first.

542
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,790
Let's meet in Yandu.

543
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:44,750
Take care.

544
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,870
What is Ji Tanyin doing over there?

545
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,150
She's been sitting there for ages

546
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,270
without moving a bit.

547
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:04,540
Does this happen a lot?

548
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:05,550
Well,

549
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:07,150
she's just a bookworm,

550
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:08,670
always off in her own world.

551
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:10,580
Who knows what she's thinking about?

552
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:44,070
Hannv.

553
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,990
I wonder why you called me up today.

554
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:47,110
Is it something important?

555
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:49,480
Nothing important.

556
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,240
Before you left last time,

557
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,510
you mentioned a dream.

558
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,120
Afterward, Mr. Loong and I

559
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:55,230
did some analysis,

560
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:57,070
but we didn't find anything unusual.

561
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:58,350
During this time,

562
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,870
I dug into all these ancient texts

563
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:01,430
and dream-related techniques.

564
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:02,590
The books say

565
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:04,470
that while most gods' dreams

566
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:05,870
have prophetic meanings,

567
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:08,820
it's also possible that they're just

568
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:10,670
random dreams caused by overthinking.

569
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:12,340
Really?

570
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:14,310
You don't need to worry too much.

571
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:16,710
How have you been lately?

572
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:18,060
Is everything alright?

573
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,610
Everything's good.

574
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:20,630
That's good.

575
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:22,670
You're in the mortal realm

576
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:23,790
all alone.

577
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,990
If anything happens,

578
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:27,110
reach out to Mr. Loong or me.

579
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,790
Don't handle everything on your own.

580
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:30,190
Okay.

581
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:31,430
Thank you, Hannv.

582
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:32,470
Oh, by the way,

583
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:34,430
your birthday is coming up soon, isn't it?

584
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:37,070
My birthday?

585
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,800
It's still a while away.

586
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:41,500
I was born in the fall.

587
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:44,050
I must have remembered it wrong.

588
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:46,340
I want to make you an embroidery piece

589
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:47,930
as a birthday gift.

590
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:49,910
I'll need your birth date and time for that.

591
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,310
Why don't you write them down for me?

592
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,670
Sure.

593
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:23,830
Kai Shan.

594
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:26,389
Have you packed enough food for the trip?

595
00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:29,030
It's here.

596
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:32,690
I'll go get her.

597
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,460
No need.

598
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:34,909
You two bring the food

599
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:35,790
onto the carriage.

600
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:36,670
I'll go get her.

601
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:47,260
We're leaving.

602
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,270
Ji Tanyin.

603
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:02,190
When I heard you were back,

604
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,620
I thought you were struck dead

605
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,760
by lightning again.

606
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:05,800
No.

607
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,200
Hannv called me,

608
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:08,510
so I came back to check on things.

609
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:09,760
With all gods in slumber

610
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,270
and you down in the mortal realm,

611
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:13,570
the Heavenly Realm is eerily quiet!

612
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,150
Isn't Hannv

613
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,150
still here?

614
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:17,750
She barely

615
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:19,350
leaves the Luofu Sea.

616
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:20,710
It doesn't make a difference if she's here or not.

617
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:21,510
Ji Tanyin.

618
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:23,270
Ji Tanyin.

619
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:24,950
Ji Tanyin.

620
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:26,070
I'm not done talking.

621
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:26,790
I've got things to do.

622
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:27,920
I'll come see you another day.

623
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:34,460
How could she leave

624
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:36,230
halfway through the conversation?

625
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:53,750
You're awake.

626
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,220
You didn't leave me behind this time.

627
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:00,390
Our next stop

628
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:01,750
is an amazing place.

629
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,290
If you hadn't woken up,

630
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,590
I was gonna bury you there.

631
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:10,550
What are you reading?

632
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,960
"The Story of the Mute Lady of Wu Mountain."

633
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,280
Have you heard of it?

634
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:22,710
It's said that the Mute Lady

635
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:23,990
also once trained

636
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:25,110
under your master, Xie You.

637
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:27,550
And she was quite accomplished in craftsmanship.

638
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:29,390
You and she studied under the same master.

639
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:31,350
Have you ever heard of her name?

640
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:32,950
Back when Master

641
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:33,950
started taking students,

642
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:35,310
he taught quite a few people.

643
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:37,700
I was focused on learning and didn't socialize much,

644
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,470
so I didn't get to know everyone.

645
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,600
What do you think of the book?

646
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:50,500
It's quite interesting.

647
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:52,510
If everything in it is true,

648
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:53,430
then this fellow disciple of mine

649
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:54,780
is really impressive.

650
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:07,710
[Orange Lake]

651
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:26,790
Madam, good morning.

652
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:45,070
[Yunniang, a human]

653
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:47,070
Mute Goddess of Wu Mountain,

654
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:48,030
please bless me.

655
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:49,190
May fortune fall from the sky

656
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:50,030
while I sit at home.

657
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:50,870
May rich fools come every day,

658
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:51,630
generous with their money.

659
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:52,500
May the poor stay away,

660
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,750
and the ugly not make trouble.

661
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:57,790
Madam,

662
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:59,200
you pray to the Mute Goddess every day

663
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,070
for those things,

664
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:01,830
but maybe taking San and me out

665
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:03,470
to rob someone could fulfill your wishes faster.

666
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:05,550
You think I wouldn't if I could?

667
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,160
Last night, I was thinking about it,

668
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,880
and then I saw the Mute Goddess.

669
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:12,470
No way.

670
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:15,990
You've never seen her

671
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,480
for your prayers for wealth.

672
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:19,690
It was in the backyard.

673
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:21,830
The Mute Goddess chanted a passage

674
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:23,270
of obscure scripture to me.

675
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:24,620
She also waved at me.

676
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:25,830
She had so many arms.

677
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:26,950
It felt like she could snatch my soul

678
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:27,870
at any moment.

679
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:30,390
I was so scared I couldn't sleep all night.

680
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:32,910
The scripture the Mute Goddess chanted

681
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:33,950
must've meant something important.

682
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:35,990
How much do you remember?

683
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:39,810
Her voice rose and fell,

684
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:41,470
fading in and out.

685
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:44,050
I even heard war drums in the background.

686
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:46,050
I couldn't make out much.

687
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:47,470
War drums?

688
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:50,630
Madam, did you drink last night?

689
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:55,740
Was it at the west corner of the courtyard

690
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:57,150
where you saw the Mute Goddess?

691
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,080
What? You saw her too?

692
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:04,410
It was dark and foggy last night.

693
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:06,390
Are you sure what you saw…

694
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:09,430
wasn't that wild monkey

695
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,230
that always sneaks in

696
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:11,510
to steal our food?

697
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,710
I was chopping meat until midnight last night.

698
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:15,130
That weird chanting

699
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,190
with the sound of war drums

700
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:17,790
could've been just the wind, right?

701
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:22,060
Don't you have work to do in the kitchen?

702
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:23,230
Are you trying to slack off again?

703
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:24,510
Get out, get out!

704
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,430
Madam,

705
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:32,790
have some hot water.

706
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:34,990
Madam,

707
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:36,310
I've already

708
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:37,390
flipped all the signs outside.

709
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:43,860
Stop pretending to be diligent in front of me.

710
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:45,140
Don't the chickens need to be fed?

711
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:46,670
Doesn't the vegetable patch need watering?

712
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:47,430
Get to work!

713
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:49,070
I'm going right now.

714
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:06,430
San, Si,

715
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:07,230
why are we stopping?

716
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:08,230
Madam,

717
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:09,600
someone's blocking the way.

718
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,710
Where?

719
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:27,190
Madam.

720
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,110
That guy still hasn't woken up.

721
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:32,070
The medicine from the physician

722
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:33,070
isn't working.

723
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:40,110
What if he never wakes up?

724
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:41,740
Are we going to keep taking care of him like this?

725
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:42,710
When his money runs out,

726
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:43,800
we'll throw him out.

727
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:47,630
It's raining.

728
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,670
The vegetables in the yard!

729
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:50,480
Go bring them in.

730
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:52,790
Hurry!

731
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:02,930
Why didn't those two little beggars

732
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:04,710
show up for food today?

733
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:37,420
Is something wrong with your neck?

734
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:38,870
No.

735
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:40,750
Then you were looking at me.

736
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:41,580
I was not…

737
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:45,550
I'll take a rest.

738
00:41:45,790 --> 00:41:46,630
Don't disturb me.

739
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:01,750
What's wrong with him?

740
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:04,820
He said he wanted to take a nap.

741
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:06,460
Where are we going now?

742
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,110
To Eastern Wilderness.

743
00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:09,770
Eastern Wilderness?

744
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:11,990
What? You've been there before?

745
00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:14,430
But that was

746
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:15,860
a long time ago.

747
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:16,870
The most powerful

748
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:17,990
weapon spirit among us

749
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:19,180
is sealed there.

750
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:20,190
Only Kai Shan thinks

751
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:21,350
he's the most powerful.

752
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:22,430
Don't take it seriously.

753
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:25,150
Didn't you used to say the same thing?

754
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:26,270
That was years ago.

755
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:27,630
Things might be different now.

756
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:28,440
I've improved a lot

757
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,630
over the years, after all.

758
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:31,710
He was just more composed than me

759
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:32,950
and more efficient in getting things done.

760
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:34,430
What's his name?

761
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:36,150
Lu Chen.

762
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:55,750
What a godforsaken place.

763
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:57,390
Being sealed here,

764
00:42:57,390 --> 00:42:58,630
Lu Chen must've had it tough.

765
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:02,510
Someone's coming.

766
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:05,500
Hello, sir.

767
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:05,980
Hello.

768
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,960
Are you a local?

769
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:08,950
Yes.

770
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:10,630
I'm from Rammed Earth City.

771
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:10,690
[Bao, a human]

772
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:13,350
We’re passing through

773
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:14,230
and hoping to find a place

774
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:15,270
to stay for the night.

775
00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:16,230
How far is it

776
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:17,910
to Rammed Earth City from here?

777
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:20,110
It's quite far.

778
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:21,620
Go east for about seven miles

779
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:23,730
and cross a bridge. Then you'll be there.

780
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:25,870
Thank you.

781
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:30,910
This old gentleman

782
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:31,910
is in such good health.

783
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:32,780
Not everyone at his age

784
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:34,310
can carry such heavy stuff.

785
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,340
It's getting dark.

786
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:41,910
Shouldn't we

787
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:43,190
find a place to stay for the night?

788
00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:46,710
There's a house up ahead.
