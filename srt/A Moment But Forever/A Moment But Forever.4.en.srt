[A Moment But Forever]

2
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,250
[Episode 4]

3
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,030
This Essence Nourishing Pill is actually...

4
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:04,750
What are you doing?

5
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:05,810
I'm taking him with me.

6
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:06,760
The spirit refinement is not over yet.

7
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:07,670
Don't be reckless.

8
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:08,229
Step aside!

9
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:09,139
How dare you!

10
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:12,930
Stop.

11
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,430
High Priest.

12
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,700
Why did you harm him?

13
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,600
I'm asking you a question.

14
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,110
Ji Tanyin.

15
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,350
How are you?

16
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,190
Let's go.

17
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,180
But...

18
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:34,010
Go.

19
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,430
This is Liujiao Palace's

20
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,790
new handmaiden?

21
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,150
That's her.

22
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:02,790
Grand Elder,

23
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,400
why can't we take

24
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,630
more divine blood at once?

25
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,020
Doing it every few days

26
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,030
is such a hassle.

27
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:10,710
The Divine Left Hand

28
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,910
is nourished by his essence blood.

29
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,270
If the blood runs out,

30
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:18,150
the power of the Divine Hand will disappear too.

31
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:20,990
So to remove the Divine Left Hand,

32
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:22,030
all we must do is drain

33
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:22,950
all his blood?

34
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,390
It's easy to take the hand,

35
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:27,190
but where can we find

36
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,550
a new host?

37
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,950
It's not like we haven't tried before.

38
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,310
How are you?

39
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:52,900
A bit cold.

40
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:09,790
Are you feeling any better?

41
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,149
They are torturing you.

42
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,060
It's spirit refinement.

43
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,790
The spirit refinement is fake.

44
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:22,550
You don't understand.

45
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,390
He's back!

46
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:55,500
He's not doing well.

47
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:57,380
Leave him to me.

48
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,270
Tanyin, Tanyin.

49
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:08,950
Return to the Divine Realm quickly to meet me.

50
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,270
Why have you summoned me?

51
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,780
The Five Direction Deities of

52
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,910
Thunder Division's Discipline Hall have summoned you.

53
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,990
The Thunder Division's Discipline Deities

54
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:33,600
govern the rules and laws of heaven and earth.

55
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,230
It's your first time meeting them.

56
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,240
Don't be disrespectful.

57
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,560
Answer appropriately.

58
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,590
No matter what

59
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:39,870
demands they make,

60
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,500
it's better to agree first.

61
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,110
Later,

62
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,870
we'll figure out a solution together.

63
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:05,110
[Discipline Hall of the Divine Realm]

64
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:22,790
Tanyin,

65
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:24,670
hurry and pay your respects to the Five Deities.

66
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,990
I, Ji Tanyin, God of Craft, Goddess Wushuang,

67
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:33,180
pay my respects to the Five Lords of the Discipline Hall.

68
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:34,830
Goddess Wushuang,

69
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,310
please rise.

70
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:38,550
Thank you, my Lord.

71
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,500
You went to the mortal realm to search for Taihe's

72
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,030
lost left hand.

73
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,590
It's been a long time.

[Divine Race, Deity Zhifa]

75
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:47,980
Have you made any progress?

76
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,990
Yes, my lord, I have.

77
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,390
Report quickly.

78
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:52,870
It has been confirmed

79
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:54,710
that the Divine Left Hand is on Fangwai Mountain,

80
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:57,070
in the possession of Yuanzhong, the High Priest of the Youhu Clan.

81
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:58,590
Sixty years ago,

82
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:00,590
the Youhu Clan and the War Demons went to war.

83
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,430
Dingxu, the Grand Elder of the Youhu Clan,

84
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,230
accidentally found the Divine Left Hand.

85
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,550
He then ordered the young members of the clan to try

86
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,710
[Divine Race, Deity Subao]

87
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:07,790
to control the divine artifact one by one.

88
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,150
Yuanzhong, with his exceptional talent,

89
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,640
[Divine Race, Deity Cheng'e, Deity Jicha]

90
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:10,710
gained the approval of the Divine Left Hand

91
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,350
and became its new host.

92
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,290
[Divine Race, Deity Shangshan]

93
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,460
Afterwards,

94
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:15,390
the Youhu Clan used the power of the Divine Hand

95
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:17,910
to defeat the War Demons at Pinghu Xianzhou.

96
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:20,950
So, how powerful are the magical powers of

97
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,100
the Youhu Clan's High Priest?

98
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,070
The Divine Left Hand was created by me

99
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,990
using Deity Taihe's left hand as a base

100
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,390
and refined with heavenly treasures.

101
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,390
It's an unparalleled divine artifact in the Six Realms.

102
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:32,310
Yuanzhong is a mortal being,

103
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,070
but as the new host,

104
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:36,110
his magical powers are not to be underestimated.

105
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,390
How does he compare to you?

106
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,230
Though the Divine Hand is powerful,

107
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:42,430
I am, after all,

108
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,620
the creator of this divine artifact.

109
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,030
I have my ways to deal with it.

110
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,750
Then why haven't you

111
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,670
brought the Divine Left Hand back to the Divine Realm yet?

112
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:52,390
Because

113
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,390
I cannot.

114
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:01,150
Please forgive us, my lord.

115
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,150
Since her ascension, Goddess Wushuang

116
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,150
has been diligently focused on creation.

117
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:06,390
During the war between gods and demons,

118
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,900
most of the magical artifacts used by the deities

119
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,550
were crafted by Wushuang.

120
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:10,520
After the great war,

121
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,780
the celestial ladder collapsed and Taihe fell into slumber.

122
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,070
It was Goddess Wushuang who

123
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,670
voluntarily jumped from the Ascension Platform,

124
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:16,830
passed through the Sea of Flux,

125
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,110
endured the torture of thousand of cuts,

126
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,550
before finally descending to the mortal realm.

127
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:20,790
She is humble

128
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:21,910
and straightforward in nature.

129
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,800
I hope you can be lenient

130
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,020
and allow her to explain herself.

131
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:28,710
My lord, the reason why I

132
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:29,990
haven't taken action yet

133
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,390
is because over the past 60 years,

134
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,429
Yuanzhong and the Divine Hand

135
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:33,669
have been connected

136
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:34,750
as one.

137
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,950
If we were to take the hand now,

138
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,789
it would certainly cost him his life.

139
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:39,590
I attained godhood

140
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:40,990
and receive mortal worship.

141
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,140
If I were to kill the innocent,

142
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,230
it would violate the laws of heaven.

143
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:46,390
Therefore, I'm afraid I cannot comply with the order.

144
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,150
Only those who are blameless and guiltless

145
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,440
can be considered innocent.

146
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,550
But that High Priest of the Youhu Clan

147
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,830
is guilty of the Five Evils

148
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,110
and has committed the Five Sins.

149
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:56,510
How can he be innocent?

150
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,350
My lord, may I ask

151
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:01,150
what are the Five Evils and the Five Sins

152
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,470
that Yuanzhong is guilty of?

153
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,430
Tanyin.

154
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,420
Usurping a divine artifact is the sin of theft,

155
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:07,710
an evil act.

156
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,140
My lord, there's something you don't know.

157
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,830
Yuanzhong did not usurp the Divine Hand willingly.

158
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:12,990
It was the clan's Elders

159
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,300
who, using the survival of the clan,

160
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,400
pressured him with a greater cause.

161
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,070
Yuanzhong had no choice

162
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:19,070
but to attempt to inherit the Divine Hand

163
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,230
to protect his people.

164
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,830
After the war between gods and demons,

165
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,000
the celestial ladder was destroyed.

166
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,550
The mortal beings

167
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,550
have long lost contact with the Divine Realm.

168
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:27,790
To them, the Divine Hand

169
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:28,670
descending from the heavens

170
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:29,750
was a gift from the heavens,

171
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,030
an object without an owner.

172
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,150
My lord,

173
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:33,710
is using an ownerless object

174
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,430
to protect one's kin

175
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:36,580
a sin?

176
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:39,750
Self-proclaiming godhood is the sin of fraud,

177
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:40,710
an evil title.

178
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:42,470
Yuanzhong never proclaimed himself a god.

179
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:44,350
It was members of the Youhu Clan who used his name

180
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,470
to commit unkind acts

181
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:46,710
and gather ill-gotten gains,

182
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:47,620
borrowing the tiger's might.

183
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,790
It has nothing to do with him.

184
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,710
Bringing calamity to the world is the sin of lawlessness,

185
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,550
an evil intent.

186
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:55,670
Poisoning the masses is the sin of harm,

187
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:56,510
an evil heart.

188
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:59,030
After the Battle of Pinghu,

189
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,510
Yuanzhong was feared by his own people.

190
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:02,030
His magical powers were sealed

191
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:04,190
and he was imprisoned for over 40 years.

192
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:05,270
Even now,

193
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,980
he still wears shackles all day,

194
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,150
enduring great suffering.

195
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,950
He can't even leave Fangwai Mountain.

196
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:11,430
How can he possibly bring calamity to the world

197
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:12,580
or poison the masses?

198
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,550
Even if it was his clansmen

199
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:17,190
who borrowed his reputation to intimidate others,

200
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,470
he didn't stop them.

201
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:22,080
The evil consequences committed in his name

202
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:23,630
are also his crimes.

203
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,230
He is already a prisoner.

204
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,590
How can he possibly stop others

205
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:28,470
from committing evil?

206
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:31,910
By that logic,

207
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:34,670
Deity Taihe is the Primordial God,

208
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:36,600
yet he couldn't prevent the demon race

209
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:37,630
from acting perversely

210
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:38,830
and causing chaos in the Six Realms.

211
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:41,030
Wouldn't that make Deity Taihe a sinner as well?

212
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:41,910
How dare you!

213
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,310
My lord, please calm your anger.

214
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,110
What a sharp tongue.

215
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,470
The Thunder Division manages the precepts of the Six Realms,

216
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:58,720
rewarding good and punishing evil,

217
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,870
deciding life and death.

218
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:02,190
It is the most righteous place in heaven and earth.

219
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:05,470
I dare not seek advantage through words.

220
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:07,550
I'm merely speaking the truth

221
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,910
with a clear conscience.

222
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,310
Well said, "speaking the truth

223
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:14,630
with a clear conscience."

224
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,120
Let me ask you this.

225
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,870
In the Battle of Pinghu,

226
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:21,140
Yuanzhong slaughtered countless War Demons.

227
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:23,830
He committed numerous acts of killing.

228
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,630
Is this not the sin of cruelty?

229
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,110
Is he not vicious?

230
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:30,400
In a war between two races,

231
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,550
it's a matter of life and death.

232
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,140
He did it to protect his people.

233
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:35,390
Are the lives of the Youhu Clan members the only ones that matter?

234
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,590
Don't the lives of the War Demons count?

235
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,550
Have you truly tried to understand

236
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,470
why the two clans went to war?

237
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,470
Is it all the War Demons' fault?

238
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:44,550
Are you sure

239
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:46,670
that all the souls who died by his blade

240
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,950
deserved to die?

241
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:51,230
You already have a bias.

242
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:53,430
How can you fairly judge

243
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:55,070
good and evil?

244
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:56,670
Perhaps

245
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,110
I do have a bias.

246
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,270
But may I ask my lords,

247
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:01,470
aren't you all

248
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,430
biased as well?

249
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,140
Tanyin, stop talking.

250
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:09,250
The Divine Realm needs Deity Taihe.

251
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:11,860
Deity Taihe needs the Divine Left Hand.

252
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,090
The Divine Left Hand will take Yuanzhong's life.

253
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,540
Perhaps his existence

254
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:18,910
is a sin.

255
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:20,770
But I can't accept that.

256
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,480
When I was a student, I heard

257
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,670
a saying that goes,

258
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,200
"Humans are neither good nor evil.

259
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,070
Goodness and evil reside in one's heart."

260
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:29,660
It means that,

261
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:30,870
from different perspectives,

262
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:33,030
the perception of good and evil varies.

263
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,470
You have

264
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:35,990
a reason to kill him.

265
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,870
I also have a reason to save him.

266
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,390
If I'm wrong,

267
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,900
I'm willing to bear all the consequences.

268
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,660
Tanyin, don't talk nonsense.

269
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:45,470
My lords,

270
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,630
she's speaking recklessly.

271
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,660
Please be lenient.

272
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,350
Very well.

273
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,310
This is the Prison of Restraint.

274
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:55,390
Everyone has one

275
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:57,710
created by the desires in one's heart.

276
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,910
For the virtuous, it's like spring waters in March,

277
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,470
blooming with flowers.

278
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:06,430
For the wicked, it's like the Nine Hells,

279
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,910
with raging flames

280
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,270
and evil spirits,

281
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,590
never seeing daylight,

282
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,150
never to be reborn.

283
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:13,430
This one

284
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:16,150
belongs to that High Priest.

285
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:18,830
You firmly believe he's good, don't you?

286
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:22,310
Then go in and see for yourself.

287
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,670
Thank you, my lord.

288
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:27,990
I'm willing to go.

289
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:27,950
You're awake?

290
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,660
How long have I been asleep?

291
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:31,870
Two days and two nights.

292
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:34,430
Nothing happened?

293
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:34,940
Nothing.

294
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:36,650
If anything had happened, I would have woken you up.

295
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:40,070
Baili Xiang, following Dingxu's orders,

296
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:40,870
investigated the War Division.

297
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,070
It made quite a commotion.

298
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:43,550
But everyone in the War Division is loyal to Tanghua.

299
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,470
They're united as one.

300
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:46,260
Moreover, the matter of the possessing

301
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,280
is unknown to others.

302
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,710
His efforts were ultimately in vain.

303
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:52,150
The news of the War Demons' return

304
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:53,630
has quietly spread within the clan.

305
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:56,270
Many have come back.

306
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:58,270
Tianqu Peak has been bustling these days.

307
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,350
Many people have been seeking Dingxu

308
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:00,310
for information.

309
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:02,790
What about Tanghua?

310
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:06,030
The day you came down from Tianqu Peak,

311
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,150
he beat Sheng Xiang.

312
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,590
The exact reason is unclear,

313
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:12,760
but they say Sheng Xiang offended him.

314
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:15,310
Was it a severe beating?

315
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:16,470
I don't know.

316
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:22,310
Are you going to see him?

317
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:24,170
You're still very weak right now.

318
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,510
You need time to recover.

319
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:40,430
Where's Ji Tanyin?

320
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:41,620
I don't know.

321
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,940
She hasn't left her room for two days.

322
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:45,470
What's she doing inside?

323
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,950
Sleeping, I guess.

324
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,670
Do you need her? I can call her.

325
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,670
Goddess Wushuang,

326
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:23,840
a moment in this world

327
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:25,430
is a year in the Prison of Restraint.

328
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,110
After all this time,

329
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,790
have you come to your senses?

330
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,790
You're still stubborn and unrepentant.

331
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,910
It's not that I'm being stubborn,

332
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,790
but Yuanzhong is inherently kind-hearted.

333
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:38,830
He was persecuted;

334
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:39,950
his crime does not warrant death.

335
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,470
So what do you propose?

336
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:43,790
The creation of all things is different,

337
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,670
just like the Prison of Restraint.

338
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,630
Outside, only day and night change,

339
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,030
but within, the world has long been reshaped.

340
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:52,230
Deity Taihe has ruled the heavens

341
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:53,620
for hundreds of thousands of years,

342
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:54,880
while Yuanzhong's lifespan

343
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:56,110
is fleeting.

344
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:57,700
To the gods,

345
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,420
it is merely the blink of an eye.

346
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:01,550
I humbly beseech the esteemed divine lords

347
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:02,430
to show mercy

348
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:03,910
and allow him to live out the rest of his days.

349
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,740
I'm willing to stay by his side.

350
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:07,589
When his life comes to an end,

351
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:10,230
I'll bring the Divine Left Hand to the Divine Realm.

352
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,510
Virtue is rewarded, and the heavens are not without compassion.

353
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,990
I hope you can show mercy.

354
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,910
You've seen the Prison of Restraint within his heart.

355
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:41,910
You should know

356
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,780
what it's like inside.

357
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,710
Do you still want to believe in him?

358
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:47,830
Yes, I do.

359
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,110
Why?

360
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:57,470
Forget it.

361
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,950
Now that the gods slumber alongside Taihe,

362
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:02,670
the divine race has declined,

363
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:04,630
and the celestial ladder has collapsed.

364
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:07,750
You're the only one remaining in the mortal world.

365
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:09,290
If you insist,

366
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:12,110
we have no choice but to relent.

367
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,310
Thank you, My Lord.

368
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:18,160
Don't thank me yet. I have three conditions.

369
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:21,110
You must agree to them before I grant my permission.

370
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,740
My Lord, please speak.

371
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:23,670
First,

372
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:25,270
you must not reveal

373
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,870
your identity to anyone,

374
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,020
nor disclose anything about the Divine Realm.

375
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,110
Yes.

376
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:31,870
Second,

377
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:35,190
you must remain by his side at all times.

378
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,750
The Divine Left Hand must not

379
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:39,670
fall into the hands of others,

380
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,270
nor may he

381
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,430
use it for evil.

382
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:44,350
Yes.

383
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:45,710
Third,

384
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:49,190
you must not develop feelings for him.

385
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,390
You must never let emotions

386
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,430
cloud your judgment.

387
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:54,460
Yes.

388
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,110
I will certainly comply.

389
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:14,550
Since the Demon War,

390
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,340
the gods have slumbered,

391
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:20,070
leaving only us to uphold the balance of heaven and earth.

392
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:23,400
There is no room for the slightest deviation.

393
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,630
Since you have sworn by the spiritual heart,

394
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:27,430
you must honor your vow.

395
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,100
If you break it,

396
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,110
your soul will be shattered,

397
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,390
and your divine soul will be obliterated.

398
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,590
I remember that.

399
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:36,910
Goddess Wushuang,

400
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:39,390
you are a prodigy.

401
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:43,300
At such a young age, you ascended with your craftsmanship.

402
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,710
Though you've lived for a thousand years,

403
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:47,990
your heart remains pure.

404
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:49,950
Sometimes, right and wrong, good and evil,

405
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:52,870
are not things you can tell

406
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:55,150
with just your eyes.

407
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,870
I hope that in the future,

408
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:00,670
you won't regret the choice you make today.

409
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:02,750
Thank you for your concern, My Lord.

410
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:06,110
I chose this path myself,

411
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:07,470
and I will never regret it.

412
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:18,910
You're really too bold.

413
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:21,070
You actually dared to confront

414
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:21,910
those old gods.

415
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:23,430
They didn't even care about

416
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,190
Taihe's face.

417
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,710
A quarter inside is a year outside.

418
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:26,750
So, does that mean you've been stuck in there

419
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:27,750
for two hundred years?

420
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,830
Was it really that long?

421
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:31,700
I didn't even notice.

422
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,720
You're so absentminded,

423
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,950
how could you possibly notice?

424
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:35,980
Hannv, I don't mean to blame you,

425
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,150
but since you were inside,

426
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:38,590
why didn't you try to persuade her?

427
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:39,390
Hannv has always been

428
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:40,590
speaking up for me.

429
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:46,470
Hannv, what's wrong?

430
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:48,540
Hannv,

431
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:50,710
are you blaming me, or...

432
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:51,550
You've already explained

433
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,150
everything clearly inside.

434
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:54,550
You have your own thoughts,

435
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:55,750
I won't force you.

436
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,030
But Tanyin,

437
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,310
as a god,

438
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:59,390
you mustn't misuse your divine power in the mortal realm.

439
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:01,150
Otherwise, you'll suffer backlash.

440
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,590
You are the God of Craftsmanship,

441
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:03,670
and your physical body is not strong.

442
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:05,950
With only your craft and martial skills,

443
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:07,950
you do have opponents in the mortal realm.

444
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:09,590
If you continue to push too hard,

445
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,950
be careful not to bring harm to yourself.

446
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:12,710
I've said all I need to.

447
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:13,730
I'll take my leave now.

448
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,920
Mr. Loong, please escort Tanyin to the mortal realm.

449
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,590
Is she angry with me?

450
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,550
Taihe is more important to her

451
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:28,150
than her own life.

452
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,380
Of course, she hopes

453
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,790
he wakes up soon.

454
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:35,390
Tanyin,

455
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,500
there's something I want to ask you.

456
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:39,110
Please go ahead.

457
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:41,830
You firmly protected the High Priest of the Youhu Clan,

458
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,240
swearing an oath with the spiritual heart

459
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,540
and risking your life—

460
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:45,990
was it really just because

461
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:47,100
he's a good person?

462
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:01,390
By the way,

463
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,120
when you passed by Baisha Bay

464
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:04,390
on your way to Fangwai Mountain,

465
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,480
did you try the pricky fruit there?

466
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:08,230
What's a pricky fruit?

467
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,070
It's a small black fruit,

468
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,780
about the size of a fingernail.

469
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:13,350
It's sour at first

470
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,470
but has a sweet aftertaste.

471
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,880
It's quite delicious.

472
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:00,830
How did you sleep?

473
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:02,510
Not bad.

474
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,910
I ran all night in my dreams.

475
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,420
Were you still being chased by a group of people

476
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,080
while covered in shackles?

477
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,910
It was different this time.

478
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,710
I dreamt about

479
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:17,390
the clan's grand exam from when I was a child.

480
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,590
If I remember correctly,

481
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:22,030
this is the first time

482
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:23,070
you've dreamt about your childhood.

483
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:25,640
What was on the exam?

484
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:30,020
I don't remember clearly.

485
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:33,150
I only recall that the questions were very difficult,

486
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,180
I couldn't answer them,

487
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:36,990
and time was running out.

488
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:38,670
The people taking the exam with me

489
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:40,030
started leaving one by one.

490
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,380
Who was there

491
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,100
taking the exam with you?

492
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:46,850
Tanghua

493
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:48,910
and...

494
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:54,630
Their faces are all blurry.

495
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,480
Did Tanghua

496
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:59,940
take the exam with you?

497
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:03,750
I couldn't answer the questions,

498
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,470
so I wanted to copy from his paper.

499
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,800
But that guy

500
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:10,110
covered it tightly.

501
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,590
He finished and just left

502
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:13,510
without even looking at me.

503
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:15,870
Are you worried about him?

504
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:19,410
I could barely take care of myself,

505
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:21,670
why would I worry about him?

506
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:23,540
I mean,

507
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:26,590
Xiazhi and Chiyi

508
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:27,670
have been continuously murdered recently.

509
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:30,280
Baili Xiang has taken over the War Division

510
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:31,810
and is conducting thorough investigations.

511
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:34,350
Even Jiuguang has been detained.

512
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,790
Tanghua has never

513
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:37,920
been wronged like this.

514
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,240
I heard that yesterday, he even

515
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,750
hit Sheng Xiang.

516
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,960
Tanghua used to be

517
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,230
so gentle.

518
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,430
But ever since you went into seclusion,

519
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:51,150
he's changed quite a bit.

520
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,700
Who hasn't changed?

521
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:59,110
By the way,

522
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,840
I also dreamt of the Ascension Platform in the Divine Realm.

523
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:03,630
It's made of

524
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,270
glazed tiles,

525
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:07,470
and looked so dazzling.

526
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:10,900
Standing in front of it,

527
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:13,550
I felt like a tiny ant.

528
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:16,140
No matter how hard I tried,

529
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,030
I couldn't open that door.

530
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:20,750
I have a strong premonition that

531
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,590
if I can just step through that door,

532
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:24,470
I'll ascend to a god.

533
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:29,940
Maybe it was just a dream.

534
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,350
You don't need to take it too seriously.

535
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,500
I don't think so.

536
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:36,470
Spirit refinement is especially useful for me.

537
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:39,150
Every time I return from Tianqu Peak,

538
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:40,950
I have similar dreams.

539
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:42,710
The fact that

540
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:44,190
I can see the Ascension Platform

541
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:45,070
but can't enter it

542
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:46,750
is probably because

543
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,540
my cultivation isn't sufficient yet.

544
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:53,910
Elder Xinyao,

545
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,030
the medicine is ready.

546
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:55,950
Please put it here.

547
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:00,950
Remember to take it on time.

548
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:02,750
Don't worry.

549
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:05,670
Then I'll take my leave.

550
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:07,510
Take care, Elder Xinyao.

551
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:30,190
Elder Xinyao left

552
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,390
with a cold expression.

553
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:32,680
She didn't seem to be in a good mood.

554
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:35,390
She prides herself on being a good person,

555
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:36,910
but she's been forced to do bad things,

556
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:37,870
so her conscience

557
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,420
is constantly in turmoil.

558
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,270
How could she possibly feel at ease?

559
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:42,750
So,

560
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,510
it's easier to be a villain.

561
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:46,110
At least you don't have the burden on your conscience.

562
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:48,390
So you're happy now?

563
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:51,330
Not really.

564
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:57,550
What about Tanghua? Has he been released?

565
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:00,640
You asked about that yourself yesterday.

566
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:01,430
Baili Xiang naturally

567
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:02,550
has to give you face.

568
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:04,310
He's already back at the Jinxia Palace.

569
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:07,310
Tanghua was also pushed to the edge.

570
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:08,950
He's been this way since he was young,

571
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,100
unable to take a different approach.

572
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:12,270
What about Sheng Xiang?

573
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:13,470
Is she dead?

574
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:15,430
Elder Dingxu personally intervened,

575
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:16,620
so how could he let him die?

576
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:17,820
Besides,

577
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:19,470
Tanghua wasn't that ruthless.

578
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:21,330
They're just using this

579
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,410
to pressure the War Division.

580
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:24,110
Baili Xiang has been conducting inspections in the War Division recently,

581
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:25,350
causing quite a bit of trouble.

582
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,550
If that's the case,

583
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:30,340
if Tanghua didn't make a move,

584
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,610
with that old woman around,

585
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:32,830
we'd still have a chance.

586
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,950
It wasn't in public,

587
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,750
I still feel a bit risky.

588
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:42,290
Where's Ji Tanyin?

589
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,440
What's she been doing these past few days?

590
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:44,550
Is she still sleeping in her room?

591
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,070
I don't know either.

592
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,430
Ji Tanyin,

593
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,360
what are you doing?

594
00:28:58,390 --> 00:28:59,460
I'm cooking.

595
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:00,480
Cooking?

596
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:03,310
I want to make be an automaton that

597
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:04,790
can both cook and clean.

598
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:05,790
But,

599
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:06,950
it seems like

600
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:07,830
something went wrong,

601
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,430
so it didn't succeed.

602
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,630
You two stop standing here.

603
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:14,830
Go wait for me over there.

604
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:15,630
When it's ready,

605
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:16,740
I'll bring it over to you.

606
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:18,870
By the way, I've already informed

607
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:19,890
Xiaoxiang Peak.

608
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,440
From now on,

609
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,980
they won't be delivering food to you.

610
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:23,230
I'll be in charge of

611
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,550
your meals from now on.

612
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:41,500
What's this?

613
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,110
Red Oil Cloud Strings.

614
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:44,670
And this?

615
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,310
Kidney Bean Immortal Soup.

616
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:50,590
Then this must be

617
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:51,590
the Grain Rain Tofu, right?

618
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:53,860
Yes, you figured it out.

619
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:56,870
You can't cook,

620
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:59,190
and your housework is pretty sloppy.

621
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,020
The flowers in the yard died

622
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:01,330
after you watered them.

623
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:02,150
I don't think

624
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:03,500
I've made things hard for you.

625
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:05,630
So,

626
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,430
why would you overthink things?

627
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:09,030
Why insist on cooking yourself

628
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:09,910
and making it difficult for us,

629
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:11,070
instead of letting Xiaoxiang Peak deliver the food?

630
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:13,470
Because I want to be your handmaiden.

631
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:14,310
But you already are

632
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:15,110
my handmaiden.

633
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:15,910
It's different.

634
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,020
Before, I only planned

635
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,470
to be your handmaiden for a while.

636
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:19,190
But now I want

637
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:20,230
to follow you for a lifetime.

638
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:21,870
Naturally, I should do my duty well.

639
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:29,550
Life is long. Don't casually

640
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:30,710
talk about forever.

641
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:31,710
I'm different.

642
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:32,540
When I say something,

643
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,700
I have to follow through.

644
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,020
If I say I'll be with you for life,

645
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,790
then I will.

646
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:37,980
If you cook like this,

647
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:38,670
forget about spending a lifetime.

648
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,190
I can't even endure eating it for three days.

649
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:41,310
But...

650
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:45,400
Because cooking is really too difficult.

651
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,880
The automaton can cut and cook,

652
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,750
but it can't control the heat properly.

653
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:50,790
So,

654
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:52,470
to make a dish well,

655
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:53,920
at least, I need a stove

656
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,680
that can regulate the heat by itself.

657
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:57,000
-And…
-Enough.

658
00:30:58,430 --> 00:30:59,830
There are many types of handmaidens.

659
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:01,030
Some are good at cooking,

660
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:02,020
some are good at cleaning,

661
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,470
and some are good at singing and dancing.

662
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:04,390
As for you,

663
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:12,400
you have your own strengths.

664
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,980
You don't need to compare yourself to others in everything.

665
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:15,920
Really?

666
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:18,810
I knew you're a good person.

667
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:20,270
My judgment is never wrong.

668
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,110
Good person?

669
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:22,110
Yes.

670
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:33,500
High Priest,

671
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:35,030
since we're talking about this,

672
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:37,070
let's set some rules.

673
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:38,830
What rules?

674
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:39,550
The rules for me being by your side

675
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:40,710
for a lifetime.

676
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:43,070
I've sworn to be with you

677
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:44,640
until you

678
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:45,700
reach the end of your days.

679
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:46,670
I promise

680
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:47,990
to accompany you, take care of you,

681
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:49,190
and protect you

682
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:49,830
for the rest of your life,

683
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:50,710
never interfering with you

684
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:52,540
or doing anything that might harm you.

685
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:53,310
Likewise,

686
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,830
you must promise me three things.

687
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:56,350
First,

688
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:57,630
you must not leave me.

689
00:31:57,630 --> 00:31:58,510
No matter where you go,

690
00:31:58,510 --> 00:31:59,550
I will follow you closely,

691
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:00,150
never leaving your side.

692
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:01,270
No matter what happens to you,

693
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:02,630
and whatever you go through,

694
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:03,870
even if the heavens change

695
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:04,750
and the world collapses,

696
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:05,950
we must stay together.

697
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:06,910
Second,

698
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:07,750
don't ask me too much

699
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:08,820
about the past.

700
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:09,790
I won't tell you

701
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:10,830
everything.

702
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,310
It's for your own good,

703
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:13,240
because many things

704
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,390
are decided by fate,

705
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:15,310
and you can't change them,

706
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,470
only accept them.

707
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:20,360
Third...

708
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,070
What's the third?

709
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:25,310
Third...

710
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:27,990
We probably won't reach that point.

711
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:30,030
Just remember the first two steps.

712
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:33,750
What are you laughing at?

713
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,240
Nothing.

714
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:38,190
Do you want to eat?

715
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:41,590
I'm not very hungry.

716
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:43,190
If you're not eating, go back and rest.

717
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:44,510
Do you agree to it?

718
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,110
Go back to sleep.

719
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,180
A good night's sleep

720
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:48,570
is the first step to welcoming good fortune.

721
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,030
Then I'll go first.

722
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,310
By the way,

723
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:52,500
if you're really hungry,

724
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:53,420
just eat a little.

725
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:54,510
Although it doesn't look good,

726
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:55,550
it's not poisonous.

727
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:56,710
As long as it fills you up, it's fine.

728
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:57,590
Go back.

729
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:58,910
I'm leaving.

730
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:06,670
I know what's wrong with her.

731
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:08,950
What's wrong?

732
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:11,710
Here.

733
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:22,940
Now there's only one thing left.

734
00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:21,679
Guards!

735
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:25,909
Grand Elder.

736
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:31,070
With this,

737
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:33,080
we can extend the City Lord's life.

738
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:37,580
To avoid any unforeseen complications,

739
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:40,190
I'll send someone to deliver the medicine right away.

740
00:34:40,429 --> 00:34:41,230
Okay.

741
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:43,150
As for Lyu Yao you mentioned,

742
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,080
I've already informed Yaoxiang Peak.

743
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:47,830
I told them her elder passed away,

744
00:34:47,909 --> 00:34:49,429
and she needs to go back immediately.

745
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:52,670
Elder Xinyao has agreed as well.

746
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:57,510
This Essence Nourishing Pill is extremely precious.

747
00:34:57,950 --> 00:34:59,140
If it goes missing like this,

748
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,220
even if it's not discovered right away,

749
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,110
it will eventually be noticed.

750
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:06,430
Young Mistress Dai,

751
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,590
why don't you go with us?

752
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:14,910
I still have some things to take care of.

753
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:16,430
Forgive me for speaking out of turn,

754
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:20,110
but Young Mistress Dai, your identity is extraordinary,

755
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:21,430
your martial skills exceptional,

756
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,750
and now you've regained your youth.

757
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:26,910
Why do you lower yourself like this?

758
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:29,790
Whether it's okay or not, it's fine;

759
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,470
why can't you just ask him directly?

760
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,270
Why waste time

761
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:36,030
and let years slip by

762
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,110
like this?

763
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:44,870
The weather outside is nice today.

764
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:45,550
Would you like to go out

765
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:46,550
and soak up some sun?

766
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:48,630
It's good for your health.

767
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,110
I need to rest.

768
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:54,070
Did you pick these?

769
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:56,990
Yes, I did.

770
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:58,990
You went to Baisha Bay?

771
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:01,630
It seems you probably can't go too far

772
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:03,230
with this.

773
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:07,230
You mean this?

774
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:10,790
I forgot that

775
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:12,000
it doesn't work on you.

776
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:14,160
Hurry up and eat.

777
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,480
Don't you like it?

778
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,110
These pricky fruits can't be eaten anymore.

779
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:28,830
Why not?

780
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:32,270
They're fresh.

781
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:34,690
Pricky fruit is different from other fruits.

782
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,660
If you don't eat it right away after picking it,

783
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:37,910
the sweetness fades

784
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,310
and it starts to have a faint bitterness.

785
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,150
Especially if it's left overnight,

786
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:42,930
it can even carry a slight toxicity.

787
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:46,470
Don't wander around unnecessarily.

788
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:47,830
it's better not to let others know,

789
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:48,910
or it might cause trouble.

790
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:53,310
You can go now.

791
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,470
I need to rest.

792
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:02,870
-What are you doing?
-Don't move.

793
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:07,350
It just flashed.

794
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:09,070
Is this some kind of immobilization array?

795
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:11,430
It can track your location.

796
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:15,390
Yuanzhong!

797
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:27,870
Sorry to disturb you.

798
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:36,990
This...

799
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:38,780
This golden hoop is not an ordinary item.

800
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,580
I'll go back and check some books.

801
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:52,910
Forgive me for speaking out of turn,

802
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:55,550
but Young Mistress Dai, your identity is extraordinary,

803
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:56,910
your martial skills exceptional,

804
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:59,270
and now you've regained your youth.

805
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:02,390
Why do you lower yourself like this?

806
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:05,030
Whether it's okay or not, it's fine;

807
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:06,750
why can't you just ask him directly?

808
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:09,110
Search for it!

809
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:10,190
Yes!

810
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:18,510
Greetings, Butler Shengxiang.

811
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,910
May I ask what has happened?

812
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:22,790
Something was lost at Tianqu Peak last night.

813
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:25,910
The Grand Elder has ordered to search the entire clan.

814
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:36,310
Do you really want to help him unlock

815
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:37,470
that golden hoop?

816
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:40,230
It is made of the immortal gold,

817
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:41,270
which is incredibly heavy.

818
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:43,990
Even though he has an immortal,

819
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:45,350
wearing it all day

820
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:46,470
is still torturous.

821
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:47,870
Can you unlock it?

822
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:49,670
I should be able to.

823
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:51,590
If I can put it on, I should be able to unlock it for him.

824
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:53,790
That makes sense.

825
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:31,990
I just picked some cherries.

826
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:33,190
Would you like to try some?

827
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:34,550
Just leave them there.

828
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:46,470
Do you need something?

829
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:48,590
No,

830
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:50,460
I see it's a bit messy here,

831
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:51,830
so I'm helping you tidy up.

832
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:22,420
Are you done cleaning?

833
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:25,790
Not yet, just a little left.

834
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:27,630
You interrupted me from copying the book.

835
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:32,110
Get out.

836
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:36,800
Get out.

837
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:40,070
It seems this is

838
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:41,190
the key to unlocking it.

839
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:34,140
What are you doing?
