00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,030

and a child psychologist was hired.)

00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:27,530
(The animal scenes are CGI.)

9
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:35,640
Sometimes, I go on an impromptu hunt.

10
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:40,579
This unfortunate old woman
saw something she shouldn't have...

11
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:44,280
and just had to become my prey.

12
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:50,420
Until the moment they die,
prey must put up a desperate fight.

13
00:00:50,859 --> 00:00:54,659
But this prey seems to lack
any strength at all to fight.

14
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,829
So this hunt was insignificant...

15
00:00:58,929 --> 00:01:00,369
and boring.

16
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,819
(I'm no longer
the best student in my school.)

17
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:27,489
Why wasn't I...

18
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:30,629
born to be a kid like him?

19
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:32,500
There we go.

20
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:36,599
I want to...

21
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,939
be like this kid.

22
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:43,909
I want to be this kid.

25
00:02:25,419 --> 00:02:26,750
We are...

26
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:29,849
lab rats.

27
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,229
Lab rats?

28
00:02:38,629 --> 00:02:39,800
We are...

29
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,639
lab rats?

30
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,909

(Episode 18)

34
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:03,719
I left Jennifer's photo behind.

35
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,090
Ba Reum said he'd go and get it.

36
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:08,530
If they find it first...

37
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,360
No, no. Let's wait.

38
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,469
Hang on.

39
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:19,699
Shoot.

40
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:40,430
The photo. Did you find it?

41
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:43,229
Why? Is there someone...

42
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:46,000
in the photo others shouldn't see?

43
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,069
What?

44
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:58,740
One day, I got a text
from an unknown number.

45
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,250
- A text message?
- My mom,

46
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:03,819
Jae Min,

47
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,080
and my stepfather.

48
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,689
Once I decided to get revenge
on the man who killed my family,

49
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:12,360
I looked for him everywhere.

50
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,590
Doesn't he have a criminal record?

51
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:17,230
He packed a hefty punch.

52
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,569
(New text message)

53
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,009
(Seokjin-dong 6-50, Bukyeong-gu, Mujin-si,

(Mugwan Boxing Club)

55
00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:31,439
We're closed for the day.

56
00:04:34,779 --> 00:04:36,550
I recognized him right away.

57
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:42,019
The murder instinct I'd kept bottled up
was unleashed that day.

58
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:47,660
After the brain surgery,

59
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:51,100
the instinct to kill that Sung Yo Han's
frontal lobe had suppressed...

60
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,300
was released once again
after another incident.

61
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:58,240
The scene of the murder
that was an exact copy of mine.

62
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,040
Woo Hyeong Cheol wasn't a copycat.

63
00:05:04,509 --> 00:05:06,709
After he killed a victim, someone else...

64
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:08,910
planted a fake brooch and necklace,

65
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,680
and the smell that I'd said
I'd smelled on the killer.

66
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,089
They'd even planted the mint smell.

67
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:23,290
I ended up killing Woo Hyeong Cheol,

68
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,600
and my instinct to kill was awoken again.

69
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:31,100
Who could it be?

70
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,839
Who on earth sent me
Song Soo Ho's address and why?

71
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:41,850
Why on earth...

72
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,449
did someone stage
Woo Hyeong Cheol's scene?

73
00:05:48,149 --> 00:05:49,149
I don't know.

74
00:05:53,389 --> 00:05:54,529
A trigger.

75
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,060
Someone pulled the trigger
on my instinct to kill.

76
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,230
They tossed a prey for me to kill.

77
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:04,800
I wonder what they had to gain from that.

78
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:13,339
They knew from the start
that I had the predator gene.

79
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:17,680
I remembered what Sung Yo Han
said to me before he died.

80
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,589
"We are lab rats" is what he said.

81
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:28,459
If they knew he and I
had the psychopath gene,

82
00:06:28,829 --> 00:06:31,600
then you're involved very closely
with this experiment.

83
00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:35,870
I... I don't know anything.

84
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,569
You don't know?

85
00:06:40,509 --> 00:06:41,939
My diary over there.

86
00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:45,209
Sung Yo Han's burner phone
from which he called you many times.

87
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,040
Why did I find them among your things?

88
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:50,110
Explain it so I can understand.

89
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:56,350
You knew from the start
I was a predator, didn't you?

90
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,829
I knew it all.

91
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,629
I heard of a series of murders in Korea...

92
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,399
that could be the work of a psychopath.

93
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,240
I thought it could be
the work of one of the two fetuses,

94
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,209
so I rushed to Korea out of concern.

95
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:22,850
Back then,

96
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,850
I thought you had killed your family.

97
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:29,220
So I was convinced you were the predator.

98
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,620
Just to be sure, I located the other man.

99
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,500
Gosh, you're completely drenched.

100
00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:42,000
His eyes were full of jealousy.

101
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:45,970
The gaze with an emotion
that a predator cannot feel.

102
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:47,269
I knew then that...

103
00:07:47,769 --> 00:07:49,110
it wasn't Sung Yo Han.

104
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,910
I did what I could
to stop you from killing.

105
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,980
You were losing control.

106
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,949
After much thought, I contacted Yo Han.

107
00:08:54,539 --> 00:08:56,139
Professor. Professor Lee.

108
00:09:04,149 --> 00:09:06,720
No. I can't go to the hospital.

109
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:11,090
They're... They're going to kill me
in cold blood.

110
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,059
Who?

111
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:18,059
First, you need to get rid of him.

112
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,629
Who... Who is he?

113
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:23,500
Why was he after you?

114
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:26,500
You... You must...

115
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:31,879
You must listen to me carefully, Yo Han.

116
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,710
I told him everything.

117
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,779
That's why he could help me.

118
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,350
He treated me...

119
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,220
in his basement.

120
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,360
Then he took me
to that abandoned hospital.

121
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:53,360
You deceived and used me.

122
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,700
I'm sorry.

123
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,169
I... I tried to stop them.

124
00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:01,009
Why aren't you stopping him?

125
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:03,539
We had agreed to disclose this
once he revealed his murder instincts.

126
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:04,980
You said you'd bring in the bill again.

127
00:10:05,009 --> 00:10:06,039
This isn't what we promised to do.

128
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,049
Countless innocent lives are being
sacrificed.

129
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,850
Yet, you've been watching it
this entire time?

130
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:12,220
You've gone crazy. Stop him this instant.

131
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,950
He's gone mad.

132
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,519
Do you think I'll sit still?

133
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,889
Who? Who is it?

134
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,759
Tell me right now. Say it!

135
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:24,399
Who's behind this? Who is it?

136
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:34,870
What brings you here?

137
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:38,309
I had a favor, but I knew
you'd turn it down over the phone.

138
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:42,350
Well... I have a guest over right now.
Let's talk next time.

139
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:43,610
It'll be quick.

140
00:10:44,049 --> 00:10:45,580
Please let me interview you.

141
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,919
About what?

142
00:10:55,929 --> 00:10:57,600
The Mujin Serial Murder case?

143
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:00,559
Yes. You're the sole survivor,

144
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,470
so I'd really like to interview you...

145
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:04,070
and ask about that day.

146
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:10,070
I'll disclose everything
when the time comes.

147
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:11,809
But not now.

148
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:24,620
Where did he go?

149
00:11:50,049 --> 00:11:52,620
- Hello?
- Hey, why haven't you been picking up?

150
00:11:56,019 --> 00:11:57,690
Thank goodness he was on the phone.

151
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,960
Let's go to my place.

152
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:00,090
I'll look for a place where you can stay.

153
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,529
I need to retrieve Jennifer's photo.

154
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:03,690
I'll get it later.

155
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:05,000
No, right now.

156
00:12:05,529 --> 00:12:07,360
If they find that photo,

157
00:12:07,429 --> 00:12:09,029
they'll realize that I'm still alive.

158
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:12,200
- Okay, we'll go there right now.
- And...

159
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,970
there's something you must know.

160
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,179
What is it?

161
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:35,289
Don't worry.
The police officers will keep you safe.

162
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:37,090
Police officers?

163
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,230
Yu Na...

164
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,600
refused to talk
when I mentioned the police.

165
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:54,250
- The person you have reached...
- Why isn't he picking up?

166
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,289
(North Mujin Police Station)

167
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:10,759
Detective Go,
I heard you tracked down the vehicle.

168
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,200
You little scumbag.

169
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:15,570
- You little...
- Detective Go, why are you doing this?

170
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:19,399
You scumbag.
You're a psychopath, aren't you? Right?

171
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,909
- Sir.
- Let go. Let me go!

172
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,769
Ba Reum! Mr. Go!

173
00:13:23,809 --> 00:13:25,080
- Why are you doing this?
- Move.

174
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,750
You killed...

175
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,649
Come with me.

176
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,490
Mr. Go.

177
00:13:35,049 --> 00:13:38,120
- Mr. Go, don't do this!
- Bong Yi.

178
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:39,559
Let go.

179
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:40,590
Gosh.

180
00:13:40,659 --> 00:13:42,230
- Bong Yi!
- Bong Yi!

181
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,389
Let him go.

182
00:13:43,429 --> 00:13:46,029
- What's going on?
- Mr. Go, what are you doing?

183
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,730
- What are you doing?
- Get off me!

184
00:13:47,769 --> 00:13:49,500
Let me go! Let go!

185
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,200
Bong Yi, go.

186
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,440
Wait!

187
00:13:52,539 --> 00:13:54,539
- Ba Reum! Mr. Go!
- Hey.

188
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:55,710
- You punk.
- Hey!

189
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:57,809
You killed them all, didn't you?

190
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,309
Kang Deok Soo, Lee Jae Shik,
and Kim Byeong Tae.

191
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:04,080
Why aren't you denying it?

192
00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:06,750
Is it true? Did you kill them?

193
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,950
- Hey, what are you talking about?
- He killed them!

194
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,820
Here's the proof.

195
00:14:19,429 --> 00:14:20,600
Where's Detective Lee?

196
00:14:21,769 --> 00:14:23,470
Where did Lee Min Soo go?

197
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,539
Min Soo!

198
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,039
You scumbag. You're in there, aren't you?
Right?

199
00:14:33,309 --> 00:14:34,580
Come out right now.

200
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,110
Come out!

201
00:14:36,149 --> 00:14:38,279
- What is it this time?
- Darn it.

202
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,389
- Where is it?
- Where's what?

203
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,629
- Calm down, Mu Chi.
- Darn it.

204
00:14:48,029 --> 00:14:49,259
How did he know?

205
00:14:49,629 --> 00:14:51,230
What proof does he have?

206
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,200
I can't come clean right now.

207
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,830
I need to buy time until I catch
Chi Gook's killer.

208
00:14:57,299 --> 00:14:58,740
I should deny the allegation for now.

209
00:15:00,139 --> 00:15:01,409
One minute.

210
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:07,309
- Come on.
- Let me go.

211
00:15:07,379 --> 00:15:08,679
- Where is it?
- Don't do this.

212
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:09,750
Let me go.

213
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,049
- Mu Chi.
- Move aside, you punk!

214
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,149
What's your relationship?

215
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,549
Are you a dream team? Are you?

216
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,460
Do you kill people,
and do you clean up afterward?

217
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:23,230
Come on. What are you saying I cleaned up?

218
00:15:23,429 --> 00:15:24,500
"Clean up"?

219
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:27,100
The footage from the dashcam
in the 6264 car where the man was killed.

220
00:15:27,129 --> 00:15:29,169
You took it
and flushed it down the toilet!

221
00:15:29,669 --> 00:15:30,799
He was murdered?

222
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,269
- Don't play dumb!
- Come on.

223
00:15:36,309 --> 00:15:38,440
Why do you keep suspecting me?

224
00:15:38,509 --> 00:15:40,940
Did you witness it?
Did you see me get rid of it?

225
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,080
- What? They really don't seem to know.
- Answer me.

226
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,549
Did you see me do it?

227
00:15:46,649 --> 00:15:48,690
Then...
Then what were you doing in the toilet?

228
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,159
- I pooped and flushed it down.
- Is he also one of them?

229
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,590
- You scumbags!
- Mu Chi, please!

230
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,159
That's enough!

231
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:58,230
- These scumbags...
- I said, enough!

232
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:00,429
Take them to the interrogation room.

233
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,529
Yes, sir.

234
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,299
Darn it!

235
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,639
Fine. Let's do that.

236
00:16:05,669 --> 00:16:07,039
Let's carry out an official investigation.

237
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,940
You're coming too. Come.

238
00:16:26,789 --> 00:16:29,759
Sir, can you let me go?

239
00:16:29,929 --> 00:16:31,929
Detective Shin!

240
00:16:32,029 --> 00:16:33,730
Can you please open the door?

241
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,470
Calm down. Give me your hand.

242
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,429
- My hand's fine.
- You're wounded.

243
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:38,669
Be careful.

244
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,799
It'll leave a scar if left untreated.

245
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:43,110
What in the world is going on?

246
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:46,309
- Beats me.
- Why is Mr. Go livid with Ba Reum?

247
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,980
Put this over it once it dries.

248
00:16:48,009 --> 00:16:49,149
And this ointment too.

249
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:52,480
Hang in there. You'll get out soon.

250
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:54,590
Detective Shin!

251
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:57,649
Detective Shin, why did Mr. Go claim
that Officer Jung committed murder?

252
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:59,590
Be quiet. That's bizarre.

253
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:01,759
How did he know?

254
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:04,700
He shouldn't find out that it was Ba Reum.

255
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:08,970
Calm down and explain.
What are you talking about?

256
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,099
That scumbag, Ba Reum...

257
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,740
I have no idea what he's talking about.

258
00:17:12,769 --> 00:17:14,440
I had checked the dashcam footage.

259
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:16,710
That scumbag, Detective Lee,
stole it from me back there.

260
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,940
He flushed it down the toilet.

261
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,180
We need to search for it right now.

262
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:21,180
My gosh, this is driving me nuts.

263
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:23,109
I came out after pooping.

264
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:25,049
Then he suddenly grabbed me
by the collar and started cussing.

265
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,849
I definitely saw Ba Reum.

266
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,220
He was at the scene
where Kang Deok Soo was murdered.

267
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,890
The day Kang Deok Soo was murdered,

268
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,019
I was home with my nephew...

269
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:34,490
because my cat had given birth.

270
00:17:34,529 --> 00:17:37,130
Detective Lee intentionally gave us
Kang Deok Soo's mother's note late.

271
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,000
I just forgot about it.

272
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:40,099
This is unbelievable.

273
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:42,200
He had a tattoo. They all have one.

274
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,869
- But he removed his.
- I told him I got it lasered...

275
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,640
because they were
my ex-girlfriend's initials.

276
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:47,700
Which tattoo parlor was it?

277
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,539
He'd get a henna tattoo
every now and then.

278
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:51,380
Then one day, he wanted a tattoo.

279
00:17:51,579 --> 00:17:53,539
A tattoo? What was it?

280
00:17:53,579 --> 00:17:56,450
- We always take photos of our work.
- Okay.

281
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,750
- Let me look for it.
- Thank you.

282
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,220
Here it is.

283
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:10,029
Thank you. Goodbye.

284
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:23,710
(OZ)

285
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:28,549
He did go there with his girlfriend
and the letters were "OJ", not "OZ".

286
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:31,750
I knew it. Gosh, that punk.

287
00:18:38,259 --> 00:18:39,390
Hello?

288
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,490
What?

289
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:44,130
I see. Okay.

290
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,099
Did your wife disappear again?

291
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:51,299
Oh, dear.

292
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,740
It happens so often. I'm worried.

293
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:55,940
- He wasn't lying?
- That's right.

294
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:59,140
I guess he bribed the owner
of the tattoo shop too.

295
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:01,680
Detective Kang found the address
and sent Detective Shin there right away.

296
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,079
He didn't have time for bribing the owner.

297
00:19:03,549 --> 00:19:05,119
Anyway, go home for now.

298
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,180
Why must I go home?

299
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,750
Come on. Just do as I say.

300
00:19:07,819 --> 00:19:10,519
The video clip of you beating up
Officer Jung is all over the Internet.

301
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,960
Why did you have to do that
in front of civilians and reporters?

302
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:15,730
Hey, you know that Officer Jung is known
as a national hero.

303
00:19:15,789 --> 00:19:18,430
People call you a national traitor
because you beat that poor boy up.

304
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,059
A national traitor or whatever.
I don't care.

305
00:19:21,769 --> 00:19:25,039
"A national hero"?
The whole country will be in shock.

306
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,200
You should care.

307
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,440
The police commissioner
just ordered the dismissal of you.

308
00:19:28,539 --> 00:19:30,069
He ordered to leave you out of all cases.

309
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:32,940
You punk, where are you going now?

310
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,210
To the bathroom!

311
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,150
I'll find that flash drive by myself!

312
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:42,119
Was Lee Min Soo also part of OZ?

313
00:19:42,289 --> 00:19:44,759
The footage from the dashcam
in the 6264 car where the man was killed.

314
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:48,529
How much did he see in that footage?

315
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,900
Officer Jung, go home to rest.

316
00:19:53,329 --> 00:19:55,930
Sir, wait. What about Detective Lee?

317
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:57,369
We let him go too.

318
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:12,619
(Log into
the National Police Agency Database.)

320
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:35,170
Ki Hyuk, release her.

321
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,809
You must never assault a police officer
under any circumstances.

322
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,849
What happened to Ba Reum?

323
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:54,059
I'll be right back.

324
00:20:54,859 --> 00:20:56,130
Then I'll do it.

325
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,500
No. I'll go and get it.

326
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:00,799
At least one of us should be safe
if I get caught.

327
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:04,269
And it should be you, Ms. Choi.
You should put an end to this.

328
00:21:24,619 --> 00:21:25,660
Oh, gosh.

329
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:28,430
Yo Han.

330
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:32,559
Yo Han.

331
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:37,069
Poor Yo Han. I feel so bad for him.

332
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,779
It was here, right?

333
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:51,950
You were alive, Professor Lee.

334
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,660
Hey.

335
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:06,529
- How did it happen?
- I went out to buy some meat,

336
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,670
and she left without her cardigan.

337
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:09,970
(Bang Yu Hwa,
If found please call this number.)

338
00:22:11,299 --> 00:22:13,470
Hello. Please let me check the footage.

339
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:24,720
- Look. She left.
- Pardon?

340
00:22:55,009 --> 00:22:56,480
Please hang in there for a little while.

341
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:59,119
The day is coming soon.

342
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:39,619
- Where is Officer Jung?
- Gosh. You stink.

343
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,529
Oh, man. Did you really go through
the sewage? Gosh, you stink so much.

344
00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:44,289
Did you find it?

345
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:46,359
It's too tiny.

346
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:48,599
Gosh, you smell really bad.
Go and take a shower first. Take that out.

347
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:49,769
I asked where Jung Ba Reum went.

348
00:23:49,829 --> 00:23:50,970
I sent him home.

349
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:53,240
Why did you do that?
What if he destroys the evidence?

350
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:56,569
- What about Lee Min Soo?
- He just requested leave via e-mail.

351
00:23:57,109 --> 00:23:59,079
- Leave?
- Don't come near me. You stink.

352
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,539
See? He fled!

353
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,920
Min Soo said he won't let it slide.
He said he'll sue you.

354
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:23,569
The man who killed Chi Gook.

355
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:25,640
And Detective Lee.

356
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:39,680
What are you doing here?

357
00:24:40,619 --> 00:24:41,819
Why are you coming out of there?

358
00:24:43,089 --> 00:24:45,619
I get it.
You were going to meet each other here?

359
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,559
Is that it?

360
00:24:49,859 --> 00:24:52,730
I've been dismissed
because I beat up the national hero.

361
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,430
Tell me the truth.

362
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:58,700
Or else, I'll smash your head with this
and go to prison.

363
00:24:58,799 --> 00:24:59,869
You know what my wish is, right?

364
00:25:01,869 --> 00:25:03,710
It was also you who took the knife
of Bong Yi's grandmother, right?

365
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:07,710
There were only you, me,
and Inspector Park in the CCTV footage...

366
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,950
in the evidence storage room
because you were the killer,

367
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:12,279
not because the killer avoided
getting caught by the camera.

368
00:25:12,349 --> 00:25:13,680
Only you and Detective Shin knew...

369
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:16,150
about the pay to kill
that Bong Yi gave me.

370
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:18,259
You took it
because you were going to kill him. Right?

371
00:25:20,089 --> 00:25:21,660
It all makes sense now.

372
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:24,190
Answer me, you scum.

373
00:25:26,829 --> 00:25:27,900
You're right.

374
00:25:29,369 --> 00:25:30,569
I killed him.

375
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:32,970
What?

376
00:25:33,869 --> 00:25:35,569
I took Bong Yi's grandmother's knife...

377
00:25:37,339 --> 00:25:38,980
and put it back after using it.

378
00:25:41,009 --> 00:25:42,049
It was all me.

379
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:48,650
Bong Yi was in danger.

380
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,920
I thought he would kill Bong Yi.

381
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,690
So I killed Kang Deok Soo.

382
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,970
Does Bong Yi know this too?

383
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:04,630
That's why we broke up.

384
00:26:07,069 --> 00:26:08,670
She said she was okay with it.

385
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,440
But it was too painful for me.

386
00:26:18,549 --> 00:26:21,950
But as for Lee Jae Shik
and Kim Byeong Tae...

387
00:26:23,019 --> 00:26:25,190
I don't know what you saw
to think that I killed them, but...

388
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,490
You...

389
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,829
Why did you go to the prison
on the day when Lee Jae Shik was released?

390
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:34,799
That's where I was caught.

391
00:26:37,769 --> 00:26:39,670
I got a call from Ms. Choi.

392
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,569
- Choi Hong Ju called you?
- Yes.

393
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:46,140
She asked me for Dong Goo's phone number.

394
00:26:46,579 --> 00:26:49,609
She thought that Lee Jae Shik was
the real killer of Suseong serial murders,

395
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:53,220
and she wanted to check.
So I gave her his number.

396
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:57,490
But if she was right,
Lee Jae Shik could be dangerous.

397
00:26:59,589 --> 00:27:01,420
That's why I went there.
I was worried about Ms. Choi.

398
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,200
Then what about Kim Byeong Tae?

399
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:07,359
Why did you go to his house?

400
00:27:08,329 --> 00:27:10,630
I suppose I was caught on camera
on my way in or out of his house.

401
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:13,900
When I met the elderly lady
in the cafeteria,

402
00:27:14,869 --> 00:27:17,569
she said that Kim Byeong Tae poured
something over the kid's head.

403
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:20,339
I disregarded what she said
because I didn't believe it right then.

404
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,750
But when I thought about it,
I felt like something was not right.

405
00:27:23,549 --> 00:27:25,650
That's why I sneaked
into Kim Byeong Tae's house.

406
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:29,319
I know I shouldn't have done it,
but I didn't find anything and left.

407
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:35,329
I'll pay for my sin,

408
00:27:36,829 --> 00:27:37,930
for killing Kang Deok Soo.

409
00:27:38,859 --> 00:27:40,359
I was going to.

410
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:44,170
But just until I catch
the killer of Chi Gook...

411
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:47,140
Please give me time just until then.

412
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:49,170
Please?

413
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,910
Wait. How would you explain that?

414
00:27:56,309 --> 00:27:58,079
On the day when I went to rescue Bong Yi,

415
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:00,380
OZ stopped me
by causing an accident with a truck.

416
00:28:00,579 --> 00:28:01,920
The man who was following you around.

417
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:04,450
I have no idea. It drives me nuts too.

418
00:28:05,819 --> 00:28:07,319
I have no idea who they are.

419
00:28:09,089 --> 00:28:12,029
What is he doing? Is he lying?

420
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,430
Or is there really a fake killer
pretending to be him?

421
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:19,000
What are you saying I cleaned up?

422
00:28:19,339 --> 00:28:23,339
Yes. He looked like he really
didn't know about Detective Lee.

423
00:28:23,609 --> 00:28:24,769
Please help me.

424
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,509
Just until I find the scum
who killed Chi Gook.

425
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:31,150
Give me time until then.

426
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,380
Then I'll turn myself in.

427
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,349
I beg of you.

428
00:28:53,339 --> 00:28:54,500
Detective.

429
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:58,480
I know I'm being shameless and selfish.

430
00:28:59,809 --> 00:29:01,279
Bear with me.

431
00:29:02,309 --> 00:29:03,680
I'll catch them,

432
00:29:05,579 --> 00:29:07,180
then pay for what I did.

433
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:18,599
I should still check.

434
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,720
Officer Jung?

435
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:46,359
I called about the time of release.

436
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,730
Why?

437
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:52,299
Oh... Well...

438
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:56,329
And? What else did you tell him?

439
00:30:00,569 --> 00:30:04,009
That Lee Jae Shik could be
the real Suseong serial killer.

440
00:30:04,339 --> 00:30:07,680
His DNA was found
on Kang Deok Soo's murder weapon,

441
00:30:08,109 --> 00:30:11,349
so I told him that
he could be the next target.

442
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:18,150
- You should've told me, not Ba Reum.
- You'd just go and kill him, then.

443
00:30:23,059 --> 00:30:24,730
I have to go. I have a shoot down south.

444
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:27,559
By the way,

445
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:30,700
Bong Yi left Eun Chong a present.

446
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:32,539
Did she?

447
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:36,269
She feels bad about
what she did to your kid.

448
00:30:36,869 --> 00:30:38,009
She said she was upset.

449
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,480
I understand.

450
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:48,619
It matches Officer Jung's statement.

451
00:30:54,589 --> 00:30:56,329
Is there really another killer?

452
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:58,829
(Sherlock Hong Ju)

453
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:02,869
- Mister. My baby. My baby.
- Get out of his way!

454
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,930
Don't do that. Get up.

455
00:31:05,869 --> 00:31:08,140
- Take me to my baby.
- Are you okay?

456
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:10,670
- To my baby.
- Where is your baby?

457
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:13,279
In there. It's her.

458
00:31:13,309 --> 00:31:16,180
Choi Hong Ju... Are you her mother?

459
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:17,710
Yes.

460
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:20,279
Don't we have her number?

461
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:22,349
- Call her and take this lady to her.
- Okay.

462
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:26,559
This man here will call your daughter
and take you to her.

463
00:31:26,859 --> 00:31:28,220
- Take her home.
- Yes, sir.

464
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,529
Goodbye.

465
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:31,259
- Let's go.
- My baby.

466
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:33,059
My baby.

467
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,569
Does Bong Yi know too?

468
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,240
That's why we broke up.

469
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,039
She said she was okay with it.

470
00:31:48,309 --> 00:31:49,849
But it was too painful for me.

471
00:31:51,349 --> 00:31:52,420
This is the place.

472
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:54,819
Can I help you?

473
00:31:55,319 --> 00:31:59,589
Yes. I brought Choi Hong Ju
the producer's mother home.

474
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,390
Ms. Choi's mother?

475
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,460
Do you know her?

476
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:07,500
Excuse me. He brought
Ms. Choi's mother here.

477
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:09,170
- Her mother?
- Yes.

478
00:32:09,769 --> 00:32:11,829
I think she said she was an orphan.

479
00:32:16,369 --> 00:32:17,470
Just a moment.

480
00:32:22,509 --> 00:32:24,910
The person you have reached
is not available.

481
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,650
- Hey.
- Yes?

482
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:30,819
What are you doing?

483
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:32,690
It's for personal use. Don't mind me.

484
00:32:32,789 --> 00:32:34,289
- Delete it right now.
- It's my baby.

485
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:36,259
Why are you so angry?

486
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:38,930
No, don't. Let go of me, lady.

487
00:32:39,029 --> 00:32:40,099
Darn it.

488
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:43,299
I'll blur out all your faces.

489
00:32:47,099 --> 00:32:50,210
Ms. Choi isn't picking up.
I'll watch her until...

490
00:32:52,009 --> 00:32:54,039
- Where did she go?
- Pardon?

491
00:32:56,509 --> 00:32:57,509
Where did she go?

492
00:32:57,549 --> 00:32:58,720
She was right here.

493
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:02,490
Where's Eun Chong?

494
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:04,519
Eun Chong.

495
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,059
Why did Officer Jung dump you?

496
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:14,900
Well... He just did.

497
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:16,769
It's not like we actually dated.

498
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:22,910
He said he doesn't like me anymore, okay?

499
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:25,140
Did he?

500
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:35,349
So, earlier on. Why did you...

501
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,049
hit Ba Reum?

502
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:41,390
I got the wrong idea about him,

503
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:44,059
and I apologized for it.

504
00:33:50,269 --> 00:33:51,369
Bong Yi.

505
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,140
You need to be happy.

506
00:33:55,869 --> 00:33:58,539
If you suffer and are always upset,

507
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:01,380
your grandma would be really sad, okay?

508
00:34:02,109 --> 00:34:03,609
Be strong.

509
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:13,090
Why did you come to the police station?

510
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:14,659
You'd called many times too.

511
00:34:16,989 --> 00:34:20,929
The schoolboy who saved my life.

512
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,170
The owner of the jacket.

513
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:23,670
I found him.

514
00:34:23,969 --> 00:34:26,239
- Did you really?
- But...

515
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:29,909
it was Sung Yo Han.

516
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:32,510
What?

517
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,210
I checked.

518
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:37,050
It was Sung Yo Han.

519
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:41,349
Don't you think it's a bit weird?

520
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:50,030
Hey. Psychopaths are incredible actors.

521
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:52,199
They put on a show to pretend to be nice.

522
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,329
- He was acting.
- No.

523
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:55,969
It wasn't an act.

524
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,530
It was real.

525
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,769
When I was on his back,

526
00:35:01,139 --> 00:35:02,739
I was unconscious.

527
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:05,980
I regained consciousness
for a very short while,

528
00:35:06,309 --> 00:35:08,639
and I heard him murmur desperately.

529
00:35:09,179 --> 00:35:12,650
Think about how heartbroken
your family will be if you die.

530
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,619
Your mom, dad...

531
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:19,190
Grandma...

532
00:35:20,389 --> 00:35:22,889
There's no reason for him to act...

533
00:35:22,989 --> 00:35:25,190
even when I was unconscious.

534
00:35:25,389 --> 00:35:27,699
It wasn't an act. He was serious.

535
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,400
How can a psychopath do that?

536
00:35:30,429 --> 00:35:32,239
Can you explain that?

537
00:35:38,139 --> 00:35:39,940
If, Mr. Go,

538
00:35:40,309 --> 00:35:41,679
and it's a big if,

539
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,820
if Sung Yo Han isn't the real killer,

540
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,750
my grandma...

541
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:52,190
and Father Go...

542
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:55,489
were killed by someone else.

543
00:35:56,889 --> 00:35:58,559
Don't talk such nonsense.

544
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:01,559
It was Sung Yo Han who killed my brother.

545
00:36:03,469 --> 00:36:04,530
But...

546
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:44,639
Did everyone go home?

547
00:36:45,579 --> 00:36:47,840
I'm losing all my hair due to stress.

548
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,309
It must be good to have a life.

549
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,949

00:37:29,219 --> 00:37:30,789
It's not my brother.

557

after returning from Guryeong.

That was around the time
that kid's family was massacred.

561
00:37:43,969 --> 00:37:45,030
It can't be.

562
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:49,039
It's the police.
Did you report someone missing?

563
00:37:49,369 --> 00:37:50,369
Yes.

564
00:37:50,409 --> 00:37:52,639
I sent you a photo. Can you please check?

565
00:37:53,739 --> 00:37:55,650
That's my wife.

566
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:56,650
Where is she?

567
00:37:56,679 --> 00:37:59,849
We might miss each other.
We'll bring her back home.

568
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,320
Wait at home.

my grandma and Father Go...

00:38:25,139 --> 00:38:27,539
were killed by someone else.

00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:35,179
- Thank you. Goodbye.
- No problem.

573
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:42,929
Honey, where did you get the baby?

574
00:38:43,159 --> 00:38:45,559
He's our baby. He's ours.

- Honey!
- He's ours.

Honey.

579
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:17,829
They said they found you somewhere here.
Do you remember where you found him?

580
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:22,300
Whose baby is he? Tell me right now.

581
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,329
His mother must be worried sick.
You'll be in trouble!

582
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,539
He's ours. He's our baby.

583
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:31,940
Let's take him to a nearby substation.

584
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:34,110
- No!
- Honey!

585
00:39:34,309 --> 00:39:35,309
Honey...

586
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:41,219

Yes.

592
00:39:59,099 --> 00:40:00,840
She seemed gravely injured.

593
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:05,070
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no!

594
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:07,710
- You can't pass.
- My baby! Wait!

595

There's more than enough proof
that Sung Yo Han was the killer.

601
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,340
I'm going to prove that all evidence...

602
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:40,179
points toward him.

Is everything all right?

652
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:47,619
Yes. Everything's just fine.

653
00:44:48,159 --> 00:44:50,230
What about Eun Chong? Is he sleeping?

654
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:52,190
Yes, he is.

655
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:54,360
Goodbye.

656
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:09,949
There he is.

657
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:16,719
Prosecutor Yoon.

658
00:45:17,219 --> 00:45:20,420
Didn't you dismiss
Woo Hyeong Cheol's arrest warrant?

662
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:44,550
Wake up.

What is this?

666
00:45:58,090 --> 00:46:01,760
Mr. Song Soo Ho had been donating money
to us for over a decade.

667
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:05,530
He also gave personal donations
to Mikaela.

668
00:46:08,239 --> 00:46:09,400
Did he visit her as well?

669
00:46:09,539 --> 00:46:12,840
He would from time to time
and watch her from afar.

670
00:46:15,110 --> 00:46:17,610
I still remember the look in his eyes.

671
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:22,219
It was full of pain and remorse.

672
00:46:22,949 --> 00:46:26,219
I could see them in his eyes.

after returning from Guryeong.

that kid's family was massacred.

The kid's mother tried to kill him.

679
00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:11,889
While I was trying to stop her...

680
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:14,829
I killed Jae Hoon's parents...

681
00:48:16,429 --> 00:48:17,800
Yes, Jae Hoon is okay.

682

Understood.

683
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:54,039
I didn't know there were kids in there.

684
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:57,539
I didn't know kids would be in the house.

685
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:04,980
Why did I kill your family?

686
00:49:05,809 --> 00:49:07,650
It's because your mother tried to
kill you.

687
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:09,889
If you died,

688
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:12,719
the world that I was dreaming of
could never come.

689

A world where there are no more victims
like my sister.

"No. No."

"Don't go there."

701
00:50:28,099 --> 00:50:30,500
"Don't look. Don't make any noise."

702
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:33,139
What? What do you mean by that?

703
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:35,369
"Jae Hee, don't look."

That's why he died like that.

718

I think it was soon after we heard
the sad news about the sponsor...

719
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:40,989
when he came to see her.

720
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:43,059
He visited her twice.

721
00:53:43,090 --> 00:53:46,260
He looked distressed and tired
on his second visit.

722
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:50,699
That day, he asked to let him
talk to Mikaela privately.

723
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:53,099
So I let them meet over there.

724
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:57,469
I think he thought that Mikaela was sick.

725
00:53:57,969 --> 00:54:00,539
He probably didn't know
that she's a special child...

who can remember
everything she sees and hears.

Jae Hoon. Jae Hoon.

- That's the kid who did it.
- You're right.

and avoided him."

"In that brief moment when our eyes met,"

749
00:55:40,710 --> 00:55:44,050
"I saw the same look in the boy's eyes
I had seen 15 years before then."

750
00:55:48,949 --> 00:55:49,980
It was a sudden attack.

751
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:53,420
He would've stopped the weapon
with his hands automatically.

752
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:55,159
Seeing that he has defense wounds
on her fingers,

753
00:55:55,190 --> 00:55:57,630
he was attacked even before he raised
his hands.

754
00:55:58,690 --> 00:56:00,730
If he was attacked before he raised
his hands,

755
00:56:01,559 --> 00:56:03,829
that means the attacker was standing
very close to him.

756
00:56:04,599 --> 00:56:08,070
Well... It's one of the followers
of Han Seo Joon.

757
00:56:08,369 --> 00:56:11,670
He said he did it because Officer Na was
disrespectful to Headhunter.

758
00:56:12,570 --> 00:56:14,239
The closest person.

759
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:17,780
Is he that kid just as I thought?

I'd like to talk to you about the murders
that happened recently.

Why should I care?

762
00:56:23,349 --> 00:56:25,420
I know who killed those people.

763
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:27,190
He's a very dangerous man.

764
00:56:30,059 --> 00:56:31,730
I wanted to check...

765
00:56:32,989 --> 00:56:34,329
if he was that kid.

766

If he wasn't acting...

767
00:56:45,710 --> 00:56:47,409
when he cried in her arms...

768
00:56:49,079 --> 00:56:50,380
If he was sincere...

769

00:57:03,659 --> 00:57:05,590
I see sadness in your eyes.

He won't see you.

00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:35,690
I really have to see him.

780

Ask him once more. Please.

781
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:42,030
The thing is, if he refuses,
there's nothing we can do.

815
00:59:56,130 --> 00:59:57,269
How can we trust the police?

816
00:59:58,130 --> 00:59:59,829
Then shall we go to the media?

817
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:01,340
We're up against Korea's most powerful.

818
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:04,010
If we report this, we might end up dead.

819
01:00:05,309 --> 01:00:07,440
We can't be sure how far their reach is.

820
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:08,909
Then what?

821
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:12,750
For now, let's wait until he wakes up.

822
01:00:16,949 --> 01:00:18,150
I'm scared.

823
01:00:18,650 --> 01:00:19,719
Yo Han.

824
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:23,090
If they realize I hacked the system
and stole their data...

825
01:00:23,159 --> 01:00:25,989
I think you should go abroad.

826
01:00:26,429 --> 01:00:28,400
- And you?
- Once Professor Lee wakes up,

827
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:30,230
I'll leave with him.

828
01:00:30,969 --> 01:00:33,570
Don't worry. He'll wake up soon.

829
01:00:47,019 --> 01:00:49,179
The old lady will end up in danger
if she reports me.

830
01:00:53,989 --> 01:00:55,489
She got off somewhere here.

831
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:57,190
(Gudong Village Entrance)

832
01:00:57,789 --> 01:00:58,960
"Gudong"?

833
01:01:00,059 --> 01:01:01,900
It's Jung Ba Reum's neighborhood.

834
01:01:02,530 --> 01:01:05,300
If she reports me...
Jung Ba Reum can't find out.

835
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:43,400
If only I didn't wear
Joon Sung's jacket that night...

836
01:01:45,510 --> 01:01:47,480
Joon Sung was my only friend.

837
01:01:48,610 --> 01:01:51,280
Even when people insulted me
for being Headhunter's son,

838
01:01:52,179 --> 01:01:54,449
he was always on my side.

839
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:57,989
But because of me...

840
01:01:59,789 --> 01:02:01,789
I will kill you, Jung Ba Reum.

841
01:02:06,489 --> 01:02:08,860
That's why there were
photos of me at his place.

842
01:02:32,590 --> 01:02:35,719
Why did Sung Yo Han
have Ba Reum's photos up here?

843
01:02:58,679 --> 01:03:00,619
We just got a search warrant.

844
01:03:01,050 --> 01:03:02,079
A search warrant?

845
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:14,130
Professor. Are you all right?

846
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:43,889
If the person in the car wasn't Han Guk,

847
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:49,059
whose blood was it in the car?

848
01:04:06,949 --> 01:04:07,980
Who was it?

849
01:04:20,059 --> 01:04:21,130
Jae Hee.

850
01:04:23,429 --> 01:04:24,599
In this world,

851
01:04:25,829 --> 01:04:27,400
it's just you and me.

852
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:29,639
What?

853
01:04:52,090 --> 01:04:54,900
I just don't think it's Sung Yo Han.

854
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,630
There's no way to check.

855
01:04:59,230 --> 01:05:00,400
Ouch.

856
01:05:10,949 --> 01:05:13,050
Right. The knife wound.

857
01:06:12,639 --> 01:06:14,239
There's nothing but
the abdominal gunshot wound.

858
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:17,880
There's a scar on his left arm.

859
01:06:17,949 --> 01:06:20,409
A cut from a knife. Around here.

860
01:06:22,050 --> 01:06:23,750
There's nothing on his arm.

861
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:26,320
- Are you sure? There's nothing?
- Yes. Look.

862
01:06:26,389 --> 01:06:27,489
It's blank.

863
01:06:28,619 --> 01:06:31,030
Then why did you name
Sung Yo Han the suspect?

864
01:06:31,090 --> 01:06:32,760
I clearly told you.

865
01:06:33,159 --> 01:06:35,659
What are you talking about? Look at this.

866
01:06:37,730 --> 01:06:39,599
It's not in your statement.

867
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:42,369
It can't be.

868
01:06:42,699 --> 01:06:44,269
I definitely told someone.

869
01:06:44,639 --> 01:06:45,769
Oh, right.

870
01:06:46,869 --> 01:06:49,440
I think I cut his arm.

871
01:06:50,409 --> 01:06:52,510
- Really?
- Left.

872
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:54,650
I'm pretty sure it was his left arm.

873
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:57,179
Okay. I'll tell Detective Kang.

874
01:06:57,389 --> 01:06:59,250
Who did you tell? Are you sure?

875
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:00,889
Who didn't report it?

876
01:07:01,889 --> 01:07:04,090
Are you sure you cut the attacker's arm?

877
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:07,059
Well...

878
01:07:08,030 --> 01:07:10,000
I think my memory is faulty.

879
01:07:11,670 --> 01:07:15,199
I'll look into it a bit more
and come back.

880
01:07:15,239 --> 01:07:16,269
Sure.

881
01:07:23,639 --> 01:07:25,550
Did he forget to tell them?

882
01:07:28,619 --> 01:07:32,090
How could he forget something
that important?

883
01:07:34,289 --> 01:07:36,789
The phone is turned off.
Please leave a message after the tone.

884
01:07:42,099 --> 01:07:44,230
Sung Yo Han had gone there to get
Han Seo Joon's blood,

885
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:45,630
not to kill Chi Gook.

886
01:07:46,170 --> 01:07:47,400
If he's not the killer,

887
01:07:50,039 --> 01:07:51,110
then who is?

888
01:07:52,010 --> 01:07:55,079
- We carried the box to the auditorium.
- Done.

889
01:07:55,110 --> 01:07:58,309
- We chatted and said goodbye.
- Do well. Don't be scared.

890
01:07:58,380 --> 01:08:00,010
- Bye.
- Chi Gook left,

891
01:08:00,309 --> 01:08:02,219
and I carried the box in.

892
01:08:02,750 --> 01:08:05,920
How did the killer carry
an unconscious, adult male...

893
01:08:06,650 --> 01:08:08,960
all the way to the box in the auditorium?

894
01:08:29,510 --> 01:08:30,710
Excuse me.

895
01:08:32,779 --> 01:08:35,520
Inmate 4440 agreed to see you.

896
01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:40,050
Ba Reum.

897
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:56,569
Ba Reum, I want to ask you...

898
01:09:04,609 --> 01:09:06,279
You look so haggard.

899
01:10:17,689 --> 01:10:20,149
What if the box was here from the get-go?

900
01:10:21,489 --> 01:10:23,689
What if this was where the killer put
Chi Gook inside the box?

901
01:10:26,659 --> 01:10:29,460
There's a mirror
that's positioned diagonally.

902
01:10:29,659 --> 01:10:32,029
A person will be hiding behind the mirror.

903
01:10:32,069 --> 01:10:33,970
I put it in this corner
as soon as I came in.

904
01:10:34,029 --> 01:10:35,739
So it wouldn't be in the way
of the members.

905
01:10:35,770 --> 01:10:38,409
Oh, I forgot that
I left once to have lunch.

906
01:10:38,439 --> 01:10:40,539
I have nothing else
but Ba Reum's statements.

907
01:10:41,340 --> 01:10:43,109
What if he lied to me?

908
01:10:44,609 --> 01:10:47,350
But why would he? He has no reason to.

909
01:11:14,039 --> 01:11:15,939
What if it was his doing?

910
01:12:02,359 --> 01:12:04,590
(Mouse)

911
01:12:04,890 --> 01:12:07,289
He quit? Through an email?

912
01:12:07,329 --> 01:12:09,859
Track where Ba Reum is at all times.

913
01:12:09,899 --> 01:12:10,899
Officer Jung?

914
01:12:10,930 --> 01:12:13,600
I'm going to kill you
in the most ruthless way.

915
01:12:13,869 --> 01:12:15,069
You should look forward to it.

916
01:12:15,439 --> 01:12:17,100
It'll be unimaginable.

917
01:12:17,939 --> 01:12:20,340
Ba Reum!

918
01:12:20,510 --> 01:12:22,479
Did you go to the police?

919
01:12:22,510 --> 01:12:24,210
Keep tracking this phone.

920
01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:26,479
I'll put everything back to where
they belong.

921
01:12:26,609 --> 01:12:29,020
Kim Joon Sung said he had hacked
into Finance Team Three's system.
