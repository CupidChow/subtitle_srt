(The animal scenes are CGI.)

11
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:52,549
How did you find this place?

12
00:01:57,319 --> 00:02:00,790
Not long ago, Daniel Lee
asked me to kill someone.

13
00:02:06,829 --> 00:02:08,030
The next target.

14
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,840
Consider it an apex predator.

15
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,740
This was the address he gave me.

16
00:02:17,139 --> 00:02:18,680
You have an exceptional memory.

17
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,110
I heard you have both
the predator and genius gene.

18
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,199
Why are you here?

19
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,340
Me and Sung Yo Han.

20
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,210
Were we your lab rats?

21
00:02:51,139 --> 00:02:52,810
I guess I should thank you first.

22
00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:56,009
Thank you for growing up well
and becoming a murderer...

23
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:58,250
Jung Ba Reum.

24
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,490
Sung Yo Han, unfortunately, let me down.

25
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:06,889
If the law to force the abortion of babies
with the psychopath gene was passed...

26
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,430
Or perhaps,

27
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:12,430
the fact that it wasn't
acted as a blessing.

28
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,669
Even if the board voted the law in,
the regular session wouldn't have.

29
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:20,669
I thought I needed a long-term plan
to ensure the bill would be passed.

30
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:23,780
A long-term plan?

31
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,479
So you went to Daniel Lee.

32
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:30,449
I asked him for the list of women
who were carrying psycho fetuses.

33
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:34,889
Daniel was in shock, having just realized
Han Seo Joon had killed his sister.

34
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,849
He wasn't hard to convince.

35
00:03:40,259 --> 00:03:41,490
Is this right?

36
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,990
I'm not sure myself.

37
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,500
But Daniel.

38
00:03:44,729 --> 00:03:46,800
A utopia with no crime or war...

39
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,370
doesn't come automatically.

40
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,439
We must create it.

41
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:55,340
Think of how Jennifer died.

42
00:03:56,139 --> 00:03:58,979
Let's not let
another Jennifer be sacrificed.

43
00:04:14,289 --> 00:04:16,490
So your long-term plan was to make
the board...

44
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:20,500
vote again on the scrapped bill
if we really grew up to be murderers?

45
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:23,470
At the expense of creating
a secret organization...

46
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:25,670
within the National Intelligence Service?

47
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:27,540
That's right.

48
00:04:28,209 --> 00:04:31,009
We monitored the women on the list
through their pregnancies.

49
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,910
So the babies would be born.

50
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:35,980
Give birth to that baby.

51
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:37,879
After the two boys were born,

52
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:40,649
I put agents on them
to follow their every move.

53
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:45,990
They reported what they observed,
and a group of experts...

54
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,889
analyzed every action.

55
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:56,199
Is that why you had Song Soo Ho...

56
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,800
kill my mother and family...

57
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,540
because she tried to kill me?

58
00:05:05,779 --> 00:05:07,050
That was a mistake.

59
00:05:07,579 --> 00:05:09,709
It weighed on his conscience.

60
00:05:10,149 --> 00:05:11,680
But we had no choice.

61
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:15,750
If you were to die,
it would ruin our experiment.

62
00:05:17,589 --> 00:05:19,889
How could you use a victim's family?

63
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,230
Do you call yourself human?

64
00:05:23,029 --> 00:05:26,329
We only gave them a jolt
so they'd dream of the world we want.

65
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,670
A world without crime
where there are no victims...

66
00:05:29,899 --> 00:05:31,139
and no grieving families.

67
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:34,639
Why did you just sit and watch
while I went around killing psychopaths?

68
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,939
I was flustered at first.
It wasn't what I'd wanted.

69
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:43,720
But I changed my mind
when I saw the public hail you as a hero.

70
00:05:44,579 --> 00:05:47,750
When the people who thought
you were fighting for justice...

71
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,420
realize what you really are,

72
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,790
their fury will reach a new high,

73
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:54,529
and the bill will become
that much easier to pass.

74
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,459
You used the victims' grieving families...

75
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,170
and killed off innocent people.

76
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,209
Choi Young Shin,
you're just a monster like me.

77
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:16,980
I'm originally a scientist, a geneticist.

78
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:19,819
Only science can solve crime.

79
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:22,620
Eliminating a potential murderer
before it is born.

80
00:06:22,819 --> 00:06:26,490
Creating a peaceful utopia
without murder, civil unrest, and war...

81
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:28,290
is my ultimate goal.

82
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:31,360
In the world I dream of,

83
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,569
psychopathic killers like you
must not exist.

84
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:40,100
I will nip you at the bud.

85
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:57,689
Yes. Kill me.

86
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,990
My gruesome death in your hands...

87
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:02,290
is what will bring the world I dream of.

88
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,959
As society develops,
the psychopath gene...

89
00:07:06,029 --> 00:07:07,629
spreads like a plague.

90
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,970
The time will come when the gene...

91
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,970
will wipe out all ordinary humans.

92
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,240
Before such a dreadful world comes,

93
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:18,040
we must eradicate the psychopath gene.

94
00:07:19,579 --> 00:07:22,250
Kill me. Kill me!

95
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:36,959
What is this place?

96
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:48,610
Whose home is it?

97
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:57,449
What's this?

98
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,319
Is it a villa?

99
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,060
Song Soo Ho.

100
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:17,029
(Crimeless utopia)

101
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,300
Detective Lee.

102
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,569
(The world of OZ, a crimeless utopia)

103
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:23,839
What is this?

104
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:44,029
The laptop.

105
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,230
He was killed because of that laptop.

106
00:08:46,299 --> 00:08:48,470
Then Detective Shin's killer is...

107
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:40,549
Kill me. Kill me already!

108
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,519
To save me,

109
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:47,559
you knelt before Han Seo Joon.

110
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,789
But thanks to that surgery,

111
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:53,059
I gained emotions
that psychos like me don't have.

112
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:56,799
Your lab rat can no longer...

113
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,740
take any more lives.

114
00:10:02,309 --> 00:10:03,240
No.

115
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,009
Kill me. Do it right now.

116
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,450
Do it.

117
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:13,379
That way, we can create
a safe and peaceful world.

118
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:16,190
Kill me! Do it right now!

119
00:10:21,259 --> 00:10:22,559
You're also...

120
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:25,559
a pitiful human being.

121
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,960
Ba Reum, you scumbag.

122
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,340
You have a voicemail.

123
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:09,440
Mr. Go, I'm going to take revenge
on my grandma's killer.

124
00:11:10,009 --> 00:11:11,940
I'll avenge your brother as well.

125
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:14,210
Darn it! Bong Yi!

126
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,419
Ma'am?

127
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:28,129
Why are you here?

128
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:31,860
Jung Ba Reum. Where is he?

129
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:34,870
Calm down. He did it to keep you safe.

130
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:36,629
To keep me safe?

131
00:11:38,669 --> 00:11:40,000
You'll find out soon.

132
00:11:52,149 --> 00:11:55,190
Oh Bong Yi could be abducted
and found dead later.

133
00:11:55,389 --> 00:11:57,250
Or she could get out of the car
in one piece at her destination.

134
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,529
I'm worried they'll take her hostage.

135
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:06,429
Please don't let her out
until I finish my job.

136
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,799
Please take care of the rest.

137
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:12,500
Ba Reum.

138
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:18,909
You are...

139
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:23,610
no longer the person you used to be.

140
00:12:25,149 --> 00:12:27,789
You held yourself back
from murdering Choi Young Shin.

141
00:12:30,289 --> 00:12:32,320
That still won't change anything.

142
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,720
Ba Reum!

143
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:12,429
Hey, can you track Bong Yi's phone?

144
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:43,129
It's a cat.

145
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,570
Ba Reum, you scumbag.

146
00:13:52,769 --> 00:13:53,870
Yes?

147
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:55,970
That piece of plastic is
from the Goatman mask.

148
00:13:56,139 --> 00:13:58,279
We found Kim Han Guk's DNA on it.

149
00:14:03,549 --> 00:14:05,049
It was him.

150
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,820
He's the scumbag who killed Mu Won.

151
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:16,129
- Officer Jung?
- Detective Go.

152
00:14:18,429 --> 00:14:19,559
Detective Go.

153
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:23,370
Detective Go. Goodness.

154
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,000
Let's drink.

155
00:14:25,669 --> 00:14:27,710
I heard you treated my brother...

156
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:29,840
very well.

157
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,610
I want to be the type of brother
Mu Won was to me.

158
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,289
Bong Yi.

159
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,659
You despicable scumbag.

160
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,759
Did you have fun?

161
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:53,360
Was it that fun?

162
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,370
I must've looked like an idiot.

163
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,370
I had no idea.

164
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:06,740
I fell in love with my grandma's killer.
I...

165
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,990
Did you have fun?

166
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:21,730
Are you watching, Grandma?

167
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:25,200
Please give me strength...

168
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:27,399
and courage.

169
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,100
"An eye for an eye. A tooth for a tooth."

170
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:32,500
That's your favorite quote.

171
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,970
I'll do exactly what you did
to my grandma.

172
00:15:36,139 --> 00:15:37,370
I'll kill you.

173
00:16:09,539 --> 00:16:10,740
Kill me...

174
00:16:11,379 --> 00:16:13,309
like you did to my grandma!

175
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:18,679
No, Bong Yi.
I can't let you become a murderer.

176
00:16:26,889 --> 00:16:29,190
She cherished you.

177
00:16:30,259 --> 00:16:34,429
So how could you?

178
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:36,899
- How?
- Bong Yi.

179
00:16:38,169 --> 00:16:39,470
I'm sorry.

180
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:41,169
My grandma...

181
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:43,139
I was wrong.

182
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,210
I'll...

183
00:16:47,009 --> 00:16:48,710
I'll turn myself in, okay?

184
00:16:49,149 --> 00:16:53,419
Let me do that, will you?

185
00:16:56,019 --> 00:16:58,559
I'm sorry, Bong Yi.

186
00:16:59,389 --> 00:17:01,230
Bong... Bong Yi...

187
00:17:08,369 --> 00:17:09,430
You!

188
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:27,750
You're right. I killed him.

189
00:17:28,789 --> 00:17:32,059
It was because of you.
I killed him to keep you safe.

190
00:17:33,259 --> 00:17:34,390
I'm...

191
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,930
a bit sick.

192
00:17:37,029 --> 00:17:40,430
But I think I can be cured.

193
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,970
Today, I saw a glimmer of hope.

194
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,839
A scumbag like you...

195
00:18:28,109 --> 00:18:29,950
shouldn't die this easily.

196
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:31,920
Turn yourself in.

197
00:18:32,819 --> 00:18:36,420
Turn yourself in
and torment yourself forever.

198
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,759
Let your guilt eat you up.

199
00:18:40,059 --> 00:18:43,730
I hope the pain is so unbearable
that you wish you were dead.

200
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,930
Atone for your sins that way.

201
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,349
Bong Yi...

202
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:08,890
Bong Yi...

203
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:46,490
It was you.

204
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:49,390
You killed Mu Won.

205
00:19:58,170 --> 00:19:59,339
Detective Go.

206
00:20:02,339 --> 00:20:03,769
Please...

207
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:06,410
arrest me.

208
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:09,980
What you were planning to do...

209
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:13,920
I'll do it.

210
00:20:14,349 --> 00:20:16,750
Stop trying to mess with me, you scum!

211
00:20:16,819 --> 00:20:19,160
Please don't ruin your own life.

212
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,259
I...

213
00:20:23,829 --> 00:20:25,130
I will do it for you.

214
00:20:25,529 --> 00:20:26,930
You lying scumbag.

215
00:20:28,369 --> 00:20:30,730
Day three. It's in great condition.

216
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,900
It's very active and shows no problems.

217
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,210
Day ten. Inactive.

218
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:39,210
It became notably inactive and slow.

219
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:42,309
Day 20. It's in very bad condition.

220
00:20:42,579 --> 00:20:44,079
It barely moves.

221
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:51,150
Day 30. Dead.

222

(The national hero Jung Ba Reum
turned himself in. "I'm a serial killer.")

225
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:48,009
No. That can't be.

226
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,980
No!

227
00:21:51,579 --> 00:21:54,019
(The national hero Jung Ba Reum
turned himself in. "I'm a serial killer.")

228
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:56,619
- You murderer!
- How can you call yourself human?

229
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,190
- Any comments?
- Say something!

230
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,759
- Bring my son back to life!
- A statement, please!

231
00:22:01,089 --> 00:22:03,730
- Bring my son back to life!
- Any comments?

232
00:22:04,029 --> 00:22:05,630
Bring my son back to life!

233
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:09,599
- Jung Ba Reum!
- A statement, please!

234
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,240
- Say a few words please!
- You murderer!

235
00:22:12,769 --> 00:22:15,140
- Please step back.
- How could you do such a thing?

236
00:22:15,769 --> 00:22:17,069
- You murderer!
- A statement, please!

237
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:18,910
- Any comments?
- I hope you die!

238
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,480
- Will you give us a comment?
- Say something!

239
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:23,150
- Jung Ba Reum!
- Any comments?

240
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:29,920
Keep your promise, Jung Ba Reum.

241
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,920
The promise you made to Go Mu Chi.

242
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,799
Let's begin the surgery.
Please put her under anesthesia.

243
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:40,329
Can you lift your head up a bit?

244
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,640
Injecting the anesthesia.

245
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:50,470
I'm scared. I'm so scared.

246
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,410
I feel sad.

247
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,150
The sunlight pouring through those leaves
makes me sad.

248
00:22:56,849 --> 00:22:58,920
- Stop.
- A psychopath...

249
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,880
can't feel any emotions.

250
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,700
If he wasn't the killer, why was the photo
of Byun Soon Young's body found here?

251
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:26,940
He moved Han Guk who was hidden here
to the abandoned hospital?

252
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:39,289
("Han Guk Was Moved to an Abandoned
Hospital Near Mujin Mountain")

253
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:07,420
Right. If there had been something here,
the police would've found it.

254
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:12,460
Ms. Choi... Ms. Choi Hong Ju?

255
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:23,930
Professor Lee.

256
00:24:37,579 --> 00:24:38,920
Jung Ba Reum did it?

257
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:48,119
If it had not been for Sung Yo Han,
I would've died.

258
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:51,799
I didn't know that.

259
00:24:53,029 --> 00:24:55,000
I told Choi Young Shin...

260
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,410
Will you be free tomorrow evening?

261
00:25:06,009 --> 00:25:08,309
I'll tell you everything tomorrow.

262
00:25:09,349 --> 00:25:10,910
I caused you to die.

263
00:25:12,019 --> 00:25:13,319
It was my fault.

264
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:06,470
But why couldn't the police find you?

265
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:11,140
There's a passage to the sewer
under this building.

266
00:26:11,309 --> 00:26:14,579
When the police came,
I was hiding in there.

267
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:17,180
I see.

268
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:20,819
I'll look after you until you recover.

269
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,250
Thank you, Ms. Choi.

270
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:27,789
I'll prove Sung Yo Han's innocence
by any means.

271
00:26:29,029 --> 00:26:30,089
No.

272
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:31,900
That's not good enough.

273
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:34,900
Jung Ba Reum lost his memory.

274
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:37,670
He thinks he's a good person.

275
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:40,339
Before his killer instinct awakes,
let's use him...

276
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,210
to get rid of all scums
who deserve to die.

277
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:46,710
And when Choi Young Shin discloses
who Jung Ba Reum really is,

278
00:26:47,579 --> 00:26:49,079
let's reveal the truth before she does.

279
00:26:49,349 --> 00:26:50,880
The truth about Jung Ba Reum...

280
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:54,619
and the horrible things
that Choi Young Shin has done.

281
00:26:58,789 --> 00:27:02,789
I was used by Han Seo Joon
as bait to lure his victims.

282
00:27:04,059 --> 00:27:05,930
I saw what kind of monster he was...

283
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,500
right beside him with my own eyes.

284
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:11,670
The likes of him never change.

285
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:14,869
Let's get rid of all those scums...

286
00:27:15,869 --> 00:27:17,170
like Jung Ba Reum.

287
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:22,779
So that there won't be
any more unfortunate victims...

288
00:27:24,549 --> 00:27:26,549
just like your little sister and Yo Han.

289
00:27:30,349 --> 00:27:33,960
To do that, I need my equipment.

290
00:27:34,259 --> 00:27:35,559
- Just die!
- A statement please!

291
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:36,660
- Say a few words please!
- You murderer!

292
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:38,160

- A statement please!

- I hope you die!

295

Let go of me. I said, let go!

- I must kill that scum. Let go!
- Please calm down.

297
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,319
I must kill him.

298
00:28:01,619 --> 00:28:04,150
- I said I must kill him.
- Calm down already.

299
00:28:04,289 --> 00:28:07,059
You know how that scum killed my brother.

300
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:10,759
- Hey! You...
- Get him out of here now.

301

(Mujin Metropolitan Police Agency)

304
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:31,349
You should tell me why you were tied up
in that house...

305
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:37,220
Then what happened...

306
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:39,619
at the amusement park a year ago?

307
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:44,490
Tell me something, please.
Do you want a lawyer?

308
00:28:47,329 --> 00:28:49,700
- Why?
- Sung Yo Han's mother is here.

309
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:51,470
She's asking to let her meet Jung Ba Reum.

310
00:28:51,569 --> 00:28:54,470
What? Absolutely no.
She'll try to kill him. Leave.

311
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:58,039
Nothing will happen.
You can let her see him.

312
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:06,349
Would a mother kill her own son?

313
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:09,619
Her son?

314
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:13,160
Mom, there's a weird kid in our school.

315
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,029
He cut open a rabbit.

316
00:29:16,829 --> 00:29:20,329
I went to your home, just to check.

317
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:24,069
I recognized you right away.

318

Are you all right?

319
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:52,619
Go home. Go on home. Run home, quickly.

320

You monster.

325
00:31:08,339 --> 00:31:09,809
I shouldn't have had you.

326
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,609
I shouldn't have given birth to you.

327
00:31:16,009 --> 00:31:17,849
That wasn't a dream.

328
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,119
You should've killed me then.

329

Why didn't you?

330
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,059
Why not?

331
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:29,859
That was...

332
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:33,930
the reason why we swapped you.

333
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:38,069
My Jae Min?

334
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,210
He didn't say anything.

335
00:31:42,769 --> 00:31:45,210
He would've been too scared to.

336
00:31:46,109 --> 00:31:47,309
I saw him...

337
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:50,349
trying to bury his brother.

338
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,279
You haven't...

339
00:31:55,289 --> 00:31:56,490
forgotten our pact, have you?

340
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:01,289
If you don't do anything about Jae Hoon,

341
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,430
he'll eventually kill his brother.

342
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:05,359
I beg of you.

343
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,259
For Jae Hoon's sake.

344
00:32:09,829 --> 00:32:11,329
When my family died,

345
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:14,069
you must've thought I'd done it.

346
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,710
Yes.

347
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,509
To end your life myself,

348
00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:21,980
I went to see you.

349
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:25,720
But someone called your aunt
had already taken you away.

350
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,819
I searched for you everywhere,

351
00:32:29,819 --> 00:32:31,220
but couldn't find you.

352
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:35,190
I found out your social security number
had been expunged...

353
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:37,789
and hoped that...

354
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:42,130
it had been expunged
because you were dead.

355
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:47,039
I forced myself to forget about you.

356
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:51,369
At around 8pm tonight, in an empty house
in Gudong slated for redevelopment,

357
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:55,509
a woman in her 70s was found
stabbed to death multiple times.

358
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,950
Police believe it was also the work of...

359
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,380
Things like you must die.

360
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,849
You monster.

361
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,519
I shouldn't have had you.

362
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,660
I shouldn't have given birth to you.

363
00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:12,660
This ups the serial killer's
victim count to six.

364
00:33:12,859 --> 00:33:14,359
I just knew it was you.

365
00:33:16,029 --> 00:33:17,230
That must hurt.

366
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,740
How could he do this to a kid?

367
00:33:22,609 --> 00:33:24,039
Why did you marry me?

368
00:33:24,069 --> 00:33:26,109
Why, if you didn't love me?

369
00:33:26,609 --> 00:33:29,410
It was more like...

370
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,349
to reproduce.

371
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,690
I needed offspring.

372
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:40,519
A junior, just like me.

373
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:43,559
I was reminded of me and Han Seo Joon.

374
00:33:44,359 --> 00:33:46,559
Like how I'd fallen in love with him,

375
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:49,000
not knowing what he truly was.

376
00:34:00,609 --> 00:34:01,680
Are you all right, ma'am?

377
00:34:03,079 --> 00:34:04,980
Why didn't you do anything?

378
00:34:05,619 --> 00:34:07,079
Before I could,

379
00:34:08,519 --> 00:34:10,289
Yo Han went to see you.

380
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,489
Yo Han...

381
00:34:18,329 --> 00:34:20,099
I left Yo Han to die,

382
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,230
and to end it all,

383
00:34:24,369 --> 00:34:26,170
I then went to your ward.

384
00:35:05,739 --> 00:35:07,079
Where did Eo Beong Yi go?

385
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:10,610
Where... Where am I?

386
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,389
Ba Reum. Oh, my. Ba Reum.

387
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:20,119
(Needs Absolute Rest)

388
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:26,699
Who are you?

389
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:38,739
Jung Ba Reum!

390
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:42,309
Officer Jung Ba Reum was discharged
after three brain surgeries.

391
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:46,579
Mujin Hospital staff say
Jung has fully recovered,

392
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:50,690
but he suffers from partial amnesia
due to temporary shock.

393
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,590
I even went to your new home.

394
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,130
You really...

395
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,300
seemed to have become a good person.

396
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:04,469
I kept watching from afar...

397
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:07,170
and had a glimmer of hope.

398
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:10,639
That perhaps, perhaps you could...

399
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:14,480
actually change.

400
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:16,309
So...

401
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:19,880
So...

402
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:26,019
To me,

403
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:31,130
you and Han Seo Joon...

404
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:33,429
are just the same.

405
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:45,610
It's time for your questioning.

406
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,050
It won't change anything,

407
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,349
but I really didn't try to kill Jae Min.

408
00:36:58,449 --> 00:36:59,690
And my family too.

409
00:37:02,329 --> 00:37:03,559
It wasn't me.

410
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:58,849
You have to arrest me too.

411
00:37:59,349 --> 00:38:00,579
I killed someone.

412
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:03,449
To save that punk,
I killed an innocent person.

413
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:04,889
- No.
- Arrest me too.

414
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,690
- Go home.
- I killed someone innocent!

415
00:38:07,789 --> 00:38:09,289
- Go home.
- Will you stop it?

416
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:16,570
- Don't do it!
- Please, don't do this.

417
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,400
Will you stop it?

418
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:19,500
Stop it.

419
00:38:23,469 --> 00:38:24,539
Hey.

420
00:38:24,909 --> 00:38:26,039
We're done.

421
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:34,349
Did you shoot him?

422
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:38,650
My poor Yo Han. My poor son.

423
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,059
Did you shoot him?

424
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:50,530
My Yo Han.

425
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:53,570
You didn't kill him.

426
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:56,739
So don't feel so guilty.

427
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:00,909
Han Seo Joon killed him.

428
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,579
It wasn't you.

429
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:07,219
Han Seo Joon's hideout is there.

430
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:08,949
See for yourself.

431
00:39:09,789 --> 00:39:10,889
That's why...

432
00:39:12,019 --> 00:39:13,559
That's why...

433
00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:15,389
Ba Reum changed.

434
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:47,889
Is it true what she said?

435
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:53,900
Who?

436
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,530
Sung Ji Eun?

437
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:57,300
Is Jung Ba Reum really your son?

438
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:58,570
So?

439
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:01,369
Did you implant Yo Han's brain into
Ba Reum while the former was still alive?

440
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:05,710
You're right about everything.

441
00:40:12,449 --> 00:40:15,119
But how was that possible?
You're behind bars.

442
00:40:15,849 --> 00:40:17,050
Nothing is impossible...

443
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:20,119
for Choi Young Shin.

444
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,960
She even kneeled before me.

445
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:27,030
She said everyone desperately prayed
for his recovery.

446
00:40:27,429 --> 00:40:30,400
She begged me to save the national hero.

447
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:46,780
Why do you think
she was that desperate to save him?

448
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:50,019
I thought you were a genius,
but you're just as stupid as me.

449
00:40:50,889 --> 00:40:54,360
You and your son were used by her.

450
00:40:54,989 --> 00:40:57,090
Just watch. Your son...

451
00:40:57,590 --> 00:40:59,659
will be thrown away.

452
00:41:12,309 --> 00:41:13,639
Choi Young Shin,

453
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,710
you wench.

454
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:27,059
When did you first find out?

455
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:39,769
You monster.

456
00:41:41,539 --> 00:41:43,070
I shouldn't have had you.

457
00:41:44,269 --> 00:41:46,980
- I shouldn't have given birth to you.
- I refused to believe it...

458
00:41:47,579 --> 00:41:50,550
although I was abused
for having a murderer as a father.

459
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:54,050
Yo Han, bring me my beige coat.

460
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:15,570
I found a photo of you holding
an unknown baby.

461
00:42:16,739 --> 00:42:19,070
So I obtained DNA
from both you and Han Seo Joon...

462
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:21,880
and requested a DNA test.

463
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:24,679
You should've called in advance.

464
00:42:29,449 --> 00:42:30,719
What is it, my son?

465
00:42:32,289 --> 00:42:33,659
You knew, didn't you?

466
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:36,760
About what?

467
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:45,170
That your son was a killer.

468
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:52,679
How could you?

469
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:56,349
How could you do this?

470
00:42:58,309 --> 00:42:59,449
Yo Han...

471
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:02,349
Yo Han...

472
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:06,519
Yo Han, I'm sorry.

473
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:10,429
I'm truly sorry. I was wrong.

474
00:43:10,489 --> 00:43:11,489
Let me go.

475
00:43:12,329 --> 00:43:13,760
You're no different.

476
00:43:14,429 --> 00:43:17,570
You are just like your husband,
Han Seo Joon, and your son, Jung Ba Reum.

477
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:21,400
I will never forgive your son
for killing my family...

478
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:24,940
and for gruesomely murdering
my one and only friend, Joon Sung.

479
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:28,409
I'll also never forgive you
for feigning ignorance.

480
00:43:32,949 --> 00:43:34,920
I'm going to kill him right now.

481
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:38,019
I'll kill him with my own two hands.
You just watch.

482
00:43:40,789 --> 00:43:44,059
No! Yo Han, no! No.

483
00:43:44,329 --> 00:43:46,130
He's a monster.

484
00:43:46,199 --> 00:43:48,159
- Move aside.
- He'll kill you.

485
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:49,670
He'll kill you as well!

486
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:50,829
I said, move!

487
00:43:52,369 --> 00:43:53,369
Yo Han!

488
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:56,070
No!

489
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:57,510
Let go of it!

490
00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:07,849
I brought the receipts.

491
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:19,760
Ms. Sung! Wake up!

492
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,400
I couldn't muster up the courage
to tell you the truth.

493
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:27,099
I was afraid you'd resent me.

494
00:44:29,639 --> 00:44:32,469
My poor son, Yo Han.

495
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,639
I know you hate me.

496
00:44:37,579 --> 00:44:38,909
But I want...

497
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,719
to be by your side.

498
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,539
Is Professor Lee still not talking?

499
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:07,510
No. I just don't understand why
when he's also a victim.

500
00:45:07,639 --> 00:45:09,949
We won't get an arrest warrant
if he stays tight-lipped.

501
00:45:10,679 --> 00:45:12,949
It'll be difficult to arrest her
since the Blue House is involved.

502
00:45:13,219 --> 00:45:14,349
Since the presidential election
is around the corner,

503
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:15,650
they'll definitely put up a fight.

504
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:18,690
I know. It's obvious that our request
for a warrant...

505
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:21,219
will be dismissed.

506
00:45:21,619 --> 00:45:23,090
We'll have to hang in there...

507
00:45:23,559 --> 00:45:26,460
and hope Professor Lee
will tell us something useful.

508
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:30,369
Turn up the volume.
Isn't that Choi Young Shin's lawyer?

509
00:45:31,469 --> 00:45:34,000
My client has no idea why that laptop
and the victims' belongings...

510
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:35,539
were in her house.

511
00:45:36,210 --> 00:45:37,940
Jung Ba Reum must've planted them there.

512
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:39,340
I knew he'd say that.

513
00:45:41,139 --> 00:45:42,909
- What's this?
- What does this mean?

514
00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:45,480
- What is this? "OZ"?
- No way.

515
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:46,480
"OZ"?

516
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:50,449
Hey, check this out. At this rate,

517
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:52,289
the tables could turn.

518
00:45:53,219 --> 00:45:54,320
Breaking news.

519
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:57,889
A, who claimed to be a former member
of OZ, a private organization in the NIS,

520
00:45:58,030 --> 00:46:00,230
- asked for a press conference...
- This informant has stated...

521
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:03,869
that she'll expose everything
Choi Young Shin did in the past 26 years.

522
00:46:03,929 --> 00:46:06,969
What if Choi Young Shin still squirms
out of this even after I turn myself in?

523
00:46:07,570 --> 00:46:11,440
Don't worry. Even she won't be able
to do that when I have this.

524
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:14,739
Hoon Seok's dad is picking him up.

525
00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:17,949
As soon as he gets on the plane,
I'll hold a press conference.

526
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:24,619
Gosh, what is this about?

527
00:46:24,949 --> 00:46:26,360
- I hope this is good.
- I know.

528
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:28,159
- Exactly.
- What's it about?

529
00:46:28,219 --> 00:46:29,690
- It must be something important.
- I know.

530
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,989
- It must be something big.
- We'll have to see.

531
00:46:32,429 --> 00:46:35,400
We've been waiting for 30 minutes now.
This is too much.

532
00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:38,429
Excuse me. Detective Kang.

533
00:46:38,769 --> 00:46:39,940
Sir!

534
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:54,250
Your father killed my parents,

535
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:56,519
and you killed my brother.

536
00:46:57,250 --> 00:47:00,090
I'll kill you myself. At all costs.

537
00:47:02,889 --> 00:47:05,389
Detective Go, find my aunt first.

538
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,199
We're running out of time.
If you want to clear Yo Han's name...

539
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:10,400
Brain implant? Lab rats?

540
00:47:10,469 --> 00:47:12,130
Is this science fiction?

541
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:13,900
Even my client is lost for words.

542
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:16,409
Both Sung Yo Han and Jung Ba Reum...

543
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:18,039
are psychopaths and murderers.

544
00:47:18,469 --> 00:47:19,440
That's a fact.

545
00:47:19,469 --> 00:47:23,079
My aunt has solid evidence
that'll prove everything.

546
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:32,420
Zoom in here.

547
00:47:37,590 --> 00:47:40,360
Track Detective Lee's phone.
I'll go to his house.

548
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,670
- Yes?
- His phone is turned off.

549
00:47:50,010 --> 00:47:51,309
We can't track him.

550
00:48:01,519 --> 00:48:04,349
(Interrogation Room)

551
00:48:07,289 --> 00:48:09,159
I bet they took measures already.

552
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:11,329
By the way, it's a bit strange.

553
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:12,659
What do you mean?

554
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:14,300
Something's strange
about Choi Young Shin's people.

555
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,730
They seemed so serious.

556
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,170
Lee Min Soo disappeared?

557
00:48:17,429 --> 00:48:18,670
What do you mean by that?

558
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:22,739
Didn't you say they called you
to tell you they were bringing him here?

559
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,269
Yes, I did.

560
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:26,440
But then we lost contact all of a sudden.

561
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:31,409
Find him immediately.

562
00:48:31,579 --> 00:48:32,849
Anyway, I'll keep looking.

563
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,079
Where will you go to find him?

564
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:35,480
Then should I just stay here
and do nothing?

565
00:48:35,519 --> 00:48:38,889
Sir, I must clear Sung Yo Han's name.

566
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:40,719
I must do that no matter what.

567
00:48:41,289 --> 00:48:43,289
We waited so long.
It'll be a waste of our time.

568
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:45,389
Let's just leave.

569
00:48:45,429 --> 00:48:47,130
- Let's go.
- All right. Let's just go.

570
00:48:51,369 --> 00:48:52,730
How did you find this place?

571
00:48:53,139 --> 00:48:54,239
Please.

572
00:48:54,269 --> 00:48:56,440
I already made a promise to Ba Reum.

573
00:48:57,170 --> 00:49:00,280
I'll hold a press conference
and show the evidence I have.

574
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,550
Ba Reum just left to turn himself in.

575
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:04,909
I have a favor to ask of you.

576
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:06,619
I'll change the topic of my show
for tomorrow at the last minute.

577
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:08,019
I need your help.

578
00:49:09,619 --> 00:49:10,989
It must be kept confidential.

579
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:13,420
You're the only one that I can trust now.

580
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:17,130
Here. It has the interviews I've done.

581
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:18,460
Make your decision after watching them.

582
00:49:36,110 --> 00:49:39,150
I'll do it. Someone must do it.

583
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:42,380
As you must know,
we don't have any solid evidence.

584
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:44,119
But let's try to make them issue
an arrest warrant.

585
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,030
Excuse me.

586
00:49:56,369 --> 00:49:57,400
Hello.

587
00:49:58,369 --> 00:50:01,000
- I have a few questions...
- As Choi Young Shin was arrested,

588
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:04,369
the police are focusing on getting
an arrest warrant with all their might.

589
00:50:04,539 --> 00:50:06,940
In the midst of
the unprecedented situation,

590
00:50:07,079 --> 00:50:10,150
everyone is wondering
whether Ms. Choi will be released or not.

591
00:50:10,909 --> 00:50:12,650
Time is almost up for the warrant.

592
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:16,619
Hasn't Mu Chi found Lee Min Soo yet?

593
00:50:16,690 --> 00:50:18,250
No. He hasn't called yet.

594
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,519
If the police fail to get
an arrest warrant,

595
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,489
they will likely have difficulty...

596
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:25,090
expanding the investigation into
the relation to high-ranking officials.

597
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:29,400
Lee Min Soo.

598
00:50:38,469 --> 00:50:40,409
They found Lee Min Soo.

599
00:50:58,989 --> 00:51:00,960
Yes. I'm leaving now.

600
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:02,630
Okay...

601
00:51:08,469 --> 00:51:09,469
Did you find him?

602
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:11,469
Mu Chi hasn't called yet.

603
00:51:12,610 --> 00:51:14,110
It's time for an interview
with the profiler.

604
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:21,019
Welcome to Sherlock Hong Ju.
I'm Choi Hong Ju.

605
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:25,119
"I am the real killer
of the Mujin serial murders."

606
00:51:25,690 --> 00:51:27,119
"I am a serial killer."

607
00:51:27,690 --> 00:51:30,889
The entire nation is in shock
at Jung Ba Reum's confession.

608
00:51:30,989 --> 00:51:33,900
As for your first murder...
Why did you do that?

609
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,769
I tried to find Song Soo Ho
who killed my family...

610
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:40,139
for a long time.

611
00:51:41,769 --> 00:51:44,139
He was my first victim.

612
00:51:44,610 --> 00:51:45,940
After killing him,

613
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:48,980
my murder instinct awoke.

614
00:51:50,010 --> 00:51:52,210
- Since then...
- This is the commissioner.

615
00:51:53,349 --> 00:51:55,949
What's more shocking
than Jung Ba Reum's murders is...

616
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:58,789
his statement about the person
behind all these crimes...

617
00:51:58,849 --> 00:52:01,090
who knew all of his crimes
but covered them up...

618
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:03,860
and even tried to make him murder
more people.

619
00:52:04,630 --> 00:52:05,889
Professor Lee said...

620
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:11,199
that Sung Yo Han and I were born
with psychopath genes.

621
00:52:12,869 --> 00:52:14,139
And Choi Young Shin...

622
00:52:15,369 --> 00:52:18,340
wanted to see if we would actually
grow up into psychopaths.

623
00:52:19,739 --> 00:52:20,909
She watched us...

624
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:23,110
and observed us.

625
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:25,380
We'll escort you.

626
00:52:29,179 --> 00:52:31,550
Wait. It hasn't been 48 hours yet.

627
00:52:31,719 --> 00:52:33,260
Then request a warrant.

628
00:52:33,719 --> 00:52:36,389
I know you can't do that
because you have no evidence...

629
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:38,090
and all you have is
that crazy punk's statement.

630
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:41,000
You shouldn't detain her
if you won't request a warrant.

631
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:43,000
She's busy with national affairs.

632
00:52:43,030 --> 00:52:44,670
What's the rush?

633
00:52:44,769 --> 00:52:46,030
We still have five minutes left.

634
00:52:47,469 --> 00:52:48,670
Hasn't Mu Chi called yet?

635
00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:54,210
Choi Young Shin used
the national institution...

636
00:52:54,239 --> 00:52:57,110
for the illegal surveillance of two boys
and their families.

637
00:52:57,210 --> 00:53:01,150
It was possible
because she had great power...

638
00:53:01,179 --> 00:53:03,320
that can influence high-ranking officials.

639
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:04,650
Inspector Bok!

640
00:53:05,219 --> 00:53:06,289
Yes?

641
00:53:07,289 --> 00:53:09,320
What are you guys doing now?
Let her go now.

642
00:53:09,389 --> 00:53:10,989
But we still have one minute left.

643
00:53:11,030 --> 00:53:13,829
Darn it. Bok Ho Nam, let her go now.

644
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:15,800
We'll request a warrant now.
We'll do it now.

645
00:53:16,599 --> 00:53:17,670
Yes, sir.

646
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:24,139
(Arrest Warrant Application)

647
00:53:34,579 --> 00:53:36,449
- Hello?
- It's been denied.

648
00:53:37,090 --> 00:53:39,719
What a joke. He didn't even have time
to check the e-mail.

649
00:53:40,090 --> 00:53:41,489
He didn't even review the application.

650
00:53:45,090 --> 00:53:46,489
Goodbye then.

651
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:55,269
The murderer Jung Ba Reum's statement...

652
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:58,010
and Chief Secretary Choi Young Shin's
statement...

653
00:53:58,039 --> 00:53:59,369
conflict each other.

654
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:03,380
However, I found out
that the arrest warrant...

655
00:54:03,409 --> 00:54:06,250
for Woo Hyeong Cheol, the real killer
of the knot murders...

656
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:08,920
was abruptly denied
right before it was issued.

657
00:54:08,949 --> 00:54:10,920
I asked why.

658
00:54:11,090 --> 00:54:12,250
No comment.

659
00:54:12,590 --> 00:54:15,719
Two more women were killed
after the warrant was denied.

660
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,159
Do you not regret it?

661
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:18,260
Why are you blaming me?

662
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:19,860
Do you think I wanted to do that?

663
00:54:19,889 --> 00:54:21,559
It was an order of the higher-ups.

664
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,269
I was demoted and sent here
because I defied them.

665
00:54:24,329 --> 00:54:26,469
We got an order from the higher-ups.

666
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:30,139
They used a lot of fancy words
like "a national trauma".

667
00:54:30,510 --> 00:54:32,010
I mean, it's weird, right?

668
00:54:32,739 --> 00:54:35,280
Since we just take orders,

669
00:54:35,639 --> 00:54:37,309
we can't disclose it.

670
00:54:38,010 --> 00:54:39,610
That's not me.

671
00:54:40,019 --> 00:54:41,449
He doesn't look like me at all.

672
00:54:42,119 --> 00:54:44,219
- It's too obvious.
- Shut it.

673
00:54:45,219 --> 00:54:47,260
Why did you cover up his murders?

674
00:54:47,289 --> 00:54:48,719
Did you order to deny the warrant?

675
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:51,289
The arrest warrant for Woo Hyeong Cheol
that was going to be issued was denied,

676
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:54,630
and Woo Hyeong Cheol's murder scenes were
made to look like...

677
00:54:54,659 --> 00:54:57,000
a copycat crime through organized acts.

678
00:54:57,599 --> 00:54:58,730
What could be the reason?

679
00:54:58,869 --> 00:55:01,199
That's nonsense. It's unreasonable.

680
00:55:01,369 --> 00:55:03,809
Let's say she ordered to deny
the arrest warrant for Woo Hyeong Cheol.

681
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:06,269
How would it have made Jung Ba Reum
commit murders?

682
00:55:06,409 --> 00:55:07,539
Are you saying she controlled him?

683
00:55:07,579 --> 00:55:11,610
In 1995, when the whole country was
shocked...

684
00:55:11,949 --> 00:55:13,579
by the Headhunter's serial murders,

685
00:55:14,849 --> 00:55:17,250
there was a discussion on the bill...

686
00:55:17,949 --> 00:55:21,989
that makes abortion legal
through the psychopath gene test.

687
00:55:22,090 --> 00:55:24,090
- How dare you?
- What are you talking about?

688
00:55:24,130 --> 00:55:26,699
- Are you serious?
- That's enough.

689
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:30,099
As her plan to get the bill passed
fell through, Choi Young Shin...

690
00:55:30,570 --> 00:55:34,099
demanded me for the list of the fetuses
with psychopath genes.

691
00:55:34,739 --> 00:55:37,769
And I took her offer.

692
00:55:41,010 --> 00:55:42,679
I gave her the information...

693
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:45,679
on Jung Ba Reum, Sung Yo Han,

694
00:55:45,710 --> 00:55:47,119
and Woo Hyeong Cheol
who had already been born.

695
00:55:47,619 --> 00:55:49,920
I went to see Choi Young Shin
and told her to stop.

696
00:55:49,949 --> 00:55:50,949
But she said...

697
00:55:50,989 --> 00:55:53,050
The more victims Jung Ba Reum has,

698
00:55:53,219 --> 00:55:55,389
the greater the rage of the public
will become.

699
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:56,519
You've gone crazy.

700
00:55:56,659 --> 00:55:58,090
Stop him this instant.

701
00:55:58,230 --> 00:56:00,030
He's gone mad.

702
00:56:00,130 --> 00:56:02,760
Give me a little more time.
The election is just around the corner.

703
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:04,130
Wait just until then.

704
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:06,230
I will make sure to get that bill passed.

705
00:56:06,429 --> 00:56:08,139
I never received such documents.

706
00:56:08,539 --> 00:56:10,670
That's Professor Lee's
unilateral argument.

707
00:56:10,739 --> 00:56:13,239
Is it really Professor Lee's
unilateral argument?

708
00:56:14,139 --> 00:56:17,650
Are both Jung Ba Reum and Professor Lee
telling a lie?

709
00:56:18,650 --> 00:56:21,079
It's all true.

710
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:31,590
He found him.

711
00:56:32,230 --> 00:56:33,329
That worked out well.

712
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:36,329
I bet they took measures already.

713
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:39,300
Something's strange
about Choi Young Shin's people.

714
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:40,800
They seemed so serious.

715
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:43,039
I think they lost Detective Lee.

716
00:56:43,739 --> 00:56:45,909
Detective Lee abducted her
but they lost him.

717
00:56:46,010 --> 00:56:47,340
Anyway, I'll keep looking.

718
00:56:50,179 --> 00:56:51,510
I saw a photo.

719
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:53,880
When I went to Detective Lee's house.

720
00:56:54,050 --> 00:56:56,789
The photo of him with the OZ guy
whom we chased at the motel.

721
00:56:57,489 --> 00:56:58,989
The one who drove the 6264 car?

722
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:01,219
Yes. I saw a woman...

723
00:57:01,719 --> 00:57:03,690
with Detective Lee in that photo.

724
00:57:03,929 --> 00:57:06,329
If Detective Lee didn't take my aunt
to Choi Young Shin,

725
00:57:07,030 --> 00:57:08,329
I'm sure he had his reasons.

726
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:10,570
Yoo Jung got stalked for seven years...

727
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:13,130
and then killed by a man
disguised as a delivery man.

728
00:57:15,699 --> 00:57:16,840
Do you happen to know this man as well?

729
00:57:17,969 --> 00:57:19,409
Oh, that's Min Soo.

730
00:57:19,710 --> 00:57:22,409
Min Soo and Yoo Jung were close friends
in high school.

731
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:25,349
I see.

732
00:57:27,079 --> 00:57:31,219
Do you know where
Yoo Jung's ashes were scattered?

733
00:57:38,230 --> 00:57:39,360
Lee Min Soo!

734
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:45,469
You scumbag.
Where are the kid and his mother?

735
00:57:46,030 --> 00:57:48,000
No way. Don't tell me that you...

736
00:57:51,269 --> 00:57:53,980
Who is that man, Mom?

737
00:57:54,010 --> 00:57:55,380
Please don't be mad at him.

738
00:57:55,409 --> 00:57:57,610
He promised to take us to the TV station.

739
00:57:59,849 --> 00:58:00,980
I'm sorry.

740
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:04,750
She said we could make a world
without victims like Yoo Jung.

741
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:08,159
Let's go.

742
00:58:10,889 --> 00:58:12,860
You scared me, Mr. Go.

743
00:58:15,059 --> 00:58:17,929
You're going live tonight?
Shouldn't this be a secret?

744
00:58:18,429 --> 00:58:20,539
You know I trust you.

745
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,269
And I trust you.

746
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:26,409
That's why I brought them here.
I can't trust the cops now.

747
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:37,019
I joined in 2005
and my first job was with OZ,

748
00:58:37,289 --> 00:58:40,360
Choi Young Shin's private organization
within National Intelligence Service.

749
00:58:41,219 --> 00:58:44,690
After Song Soo Ho killed
Jung Ba Reum's whole family,

750
00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:47,130
I was sent in as his aunt.

751
00:58:47,199 --> 00:58:50,929
Jung Ba Reum and Mu Chi
were just a tip of the iceberg.

752
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:54,539
My duty was to report on everything...

753
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:56,340
Jung Ba Reum did.

754
00:58:56,869 --> 00:58:58,309
Oh, this is...

755
00:58:58,610 --> 00:58:59,909
I do not know this woman.

756
00:59:00,309 --> 00:59:03,340
Do you have anything to prove your story?

757
00:59:04,179 --> 00:59:05,880
I swear none of this happened.

758
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:10,619
This contains all the evidence.

759
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:18,030
(Jung Jae Hoon Report, Choi Young Shin)

760
00:59:18,190 --> 00:59:21,130
(OZ, Choi Young Shin's
private organization)

761
00:59:29,269 --> 00:59:32,440
(Photos of victims taken
right after Jung Ba Reum killed them)

762
00:59:32,809 --> 00:59:35,440
I've never seen these before.
They're all fake.

763
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:39,849
Is there still no movement?

764
00:59:40,579 --> 00:59:44,190
Send Song Soo Ho's address
to Jung Ba Reum.

765
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:48,489
Pardon?

766
00:59:49,059 --> 00:59:50,389
Why send him Song Soo Ho's address?

767
00:59:51,130 --> 00:59:52,730
Let's toss him some bait.

768
00:59:53,929 --> 00:59:56,260
How many people
has Jung Ba Reum killed so far?

769
00:59:56,429 --> 00:59:58,530
Five people, including
the woman in the vineyard.

770
00:59:58,630 --> 01:00:00,099
That's not enough.

771
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:01,900
Let's wait until
the presidential election.

772
01:00:07,909 --> 01:00:09,739
- What happened?
- Explain this!

773
01:00:09,809 --> 01:00:12,010
- Explain to us!
- Don't you feel guilty?

774
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:13,480
Bring Choi Young Shin back in!

775
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:14,920
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir.

776
01:00:33,099 --> 01:00:35,769
That's too bad.
There's way too much evidence.

777
01:00:37,610 --> 01:00:38,809
Get out.

778
01:00:40,909 --> 01:00:42,179
You're getting out.

779
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:45,079
Come along.

780
01:00:51,289 --> 01:00:53,289
I got these to give
to Detective Shin's baby.

781
01:00:54,019 --> 01:00:56,719
I had no idea his baby's a girl.

782
01:00:58,630 --> 01:01:00,730
You can keep quiet, hire a lawyer,

783
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:02,099
and everything you say...

784
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:04,469
You knew all this and didn't do anything?

785
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,269
There's no government organization...

786
01:01:06,630 --> 01:01:09,000
Choi Young Shin
doesn't have connections in.

787
01:01:09,769 --> 01:01:12,039
I'm sure that's why Sung Yo Han...

788
01:01:12,110 --> 01:01:14,179
went to Jung Ba Reum himself.

789
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:21,320
Then was Sung Yo Han truly blameless?

790
01:01:21,780 --> 01:01:25,349
Or was he a horrifying murderer
just like Jung Ba Reum?

791
01:01:25,719 --> 01:01:29,960
A thankful person
who gave me the will to live again.

792
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:32,329
I'm not telling you to forgive him.

793
01:01:32,829 --> 01:01:35,260
Until he kneels before you
and asks for your forgiveness,

794
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:37,570
you must fight and stay alive.

795
01:01:38,030 --> 01:01:40,570
Doctor Sung Yo Han.

796
01:01:40,639 --> 01:01:43,539
I was dying and he carried me
on his back to the police station.

797
01:01:43,670 --> 01:01:45,940
The middle-school student was Sung Yo Han.

798
01:01:46,010 --> 01:01:48,480
He saved me when Choi Young Shin
almost had me killed,

799
01:01:49,239 --> 01:01:50,780
and he treated me.

800
01:01:51,010 --> 01:01:52,750
That's what Sung Yo Han did.

801
01:01:53,110 --> 01:01:54,849
While preparing for this broadcast,

802
01:01:55,380 --> 01:01:58,289
I happened to come across a video clip.

803
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:07,929
(Sung Yo Han from 1 year ago,
a few hours before his accident)

804
01:02:08,130 --> 01:02:11,230
I look forward to hearing
what you said you'll tell me today.

805
01:02:11,730 --> 01:02:13,130
Are you going to propose?

806
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:16,800
I made dinner for you.
Enjoy it and see you later.

807
01:02:56,409 --> 01:02:59,349
(Sung Yo Han from 1 year ago,
a few hours before his accident)

808
01:03:11,730 --> 01:03:13,590
Professor Daniel Lee said this to me.

809
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:17,969
That psychopaths never put on an act
when they're alone.

810
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:20,369
(There's no closing script.
Say whatever you want.)

811
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:28,110
I also...

812
01:03:29,239 --> 01:03:31,280
am deeply involved in this case.

813
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:35,250
I told Daniel Lee that
we should use Jung Ba Reum.

814
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:40,219
Even after hearing the full truth
from Daniel Lee,

815
01:03:40,289 --> 01:03:41,420
instead of reporting Jung Ba Reum,

816
01:03:41,659 --> 01:03:45,289
I used him to kill psychopaths
like Kang Deok Soo.

817
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:47,760
I used Jung Ba Reum.

818
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:52,469
As soon as this broadcast ends,
I will turn myself in to pay the price...

819
01:03:52,969 --> 01:03:55,170
and cooperate with the investigation.

820
01:03:58,909 --> 01:04:01,440
Here she is. Were you
directly involved with the murders?

821
01:04:01,510 --> 01:04:03,880
- What did you do?
- How about the investigation?

822
01:04:03,949 --> 01:04:05,849
- Do you have anything to say?
- Excuse me.

823
01:04:05,909 --> 01:04:07,010
What do you say?

824
01:04:09,019 --> 01:04:11,190
- I'm a murderer.
- What?

825
01:04:12,789 --> 01:04:16,260
26 years ago, I killed someone.

826
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:18,630
Ma'am.

827
01:04:23,929 --> 01:04:25,900
And my dad...

828
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:28,340
Where is he?

829
01:04:34,039 --> 01:04:35,280
Sir.

830
01:04:36,179 --> 01:04:38,380
Sir. Sir?

831
01:04:43,989 --> 01:04:45,550
Spare me.

832
01:04:47,050 --> 01:04:48,460
No...

833
01:04:53,659 --> 01:04:55,230
Don't do that.

834
01:04:59,369 --> 01:05:01,239
I lived with the guilt my whole life.

835
01:05:01,869 --> 01:05:05,309
I sincerely apologize
to Soo Jung's mother.

836
01:05:05,369 --> 01:05:06,909
(Choi Hong Ju confesses
to being involved in Jung Ba Reum's crime)

837
01:05:24,860 --> 01:05:27,059
- Detective Kang.
- Yes?

838
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,199
Let me do it.

839
01:06:01,860 --> 01:06:03,929
What took you so long to come home?

840
01:06:10,539 --> 01:06:11,909
I'm sorry, Dad.

841
01:06:13,409 --> 01:06:16,739
I couldn't leave Hyeon Seok
and Soo Jung...

842
01:06:17,909 --> 01:06:19,849
and live happily.

843
01:06:53,710 --> 01:06:54,780
Let's go.

844
01:07:03,789 --> 01:07:07,190
Dad, where's Mom?
Isn't she coming with us?

845
01:07:07,260 --> 01:07:09,860
We'll go ahead and wait for her, okay?

846
01:07:11,530 --> 01:07:13,800
- Did you spy on Jung Ba Reum?
- What are you really?

847
01:07:14,269 --> 01:07:16,239
OZ's whole story has come to light.

848
01:07:16,539 --> 01:07:19,110
Chief Secretary Choi Young Shin
created a private organization...

849
01:07:19,409 --> 01:07:21,809
and under the guise of creating
a crimeless society,

850
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:23,440
not only did she spy on civilians,

851
01:07:23,510 --> 01:07:25,849
but she also ordered people
to be murdered.

852
01:07:27,150 --> 01:07:30,019
The public is angered that such a group
was created for personal gain,

853
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:32,889
and demands a thorough investigation
be carried out.

854
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:41,630
Candidate Shin Sung Min
was voted as the 20th president.

855
01:07:41,929 --> 01:07:44,800
I sincerely thank the public...

856
01:07:44,869 --> 01:07:46,800
who voted for me.

857
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:50,539
My son Sang who died before his time...

858
01:07:51,510 --> 01:07:52,869
will be most pleased.

859
01:07:52,940 --> 01:07:54,610
(Shin Sung Min voted as 20th president)

860
01:07:54,710 --> 01:07:58,010
I voted against a bill 26 years ago,
causing it to be scrapped.

861
01:07:58,550 --> 01:08:02,449
I will decide on the bill
for a mandatory fetal DNA test...

862
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:04,989
and abortion of fetuses with psychopath
genes through a referendum.

863
01:08:06,050 --> 01:08:07,760
(Death to the murderer Jung Ba Reum!)

864
01:08:12,860 --> 01:08:13,989
(Death is the only solution
for Jung Ba Reum!)

865
01:08:14,030 --> 01:08:15,530
(Like father, like son! Death to the son!)

866
01:08:17,829 --> 01:08:21,239
The notorious murderer Jung Ba Reum's
first trial has begun.

867
01:08:21,369 --> 01:08:24,609
Even before the trial began,
we could see funeral wreaths...

868
01:08:24,670 --> 01:08:27,140
that seemed to have been sent
from citizens...

869
01:08:27,170 --> 01:08:29,510
along the wall around
the Mujin Metropolitan Police Agency.

870
01:08:31,810 --> 01:08:34,520
The referendum on the bill
for mandatory abortion of fetuses...

871
01:08:34,550 --> 01:08:36,319
with psychopath genes...

872
01:08:36,350 --> 01:08:38,090
that drew all Koreans' attention
has ended.

873
01:08:38,350 --> 01:08:41,960
The bill for mandatory abortion
of fetuses with psychopath genes...

874
01:08:42,020 --> 01:08:43,590
was passed by an overwhelming majority.

875
01:08:43,619 --> 01:08:45,359
Death to Jung Ba Reum!

876
01:08:45,390 --> 01:08:49,359
Jung Ba Reum whom the prosecutor
demanded the death penalty for...

877
01:08:49,399 --> 01:08:50,800
will be sentenced at 3pm today.

878
01:08:50,970 --> 01:08:52,670
Rather than whether he's found
guilty or not,

879
01:08:52,699 --> 01:08:55,640
people are more curious
about the severity of his sentence,

880
01:08:55,670 --> 01:08:59,409
what legal grounds
the court will decide on his sentence,

881
01:08:59,439 --> 01:09:02,810
and whether or not his trial will be
broadcast live.

882
01:09:03,409 --> 01:09:05,949
Defendant Jung Ba Reum is
sentenced to death.

883
01:09:09,180 --> 01:09:12,649
The serial killer Jung Ba Reum was
sentenced to death at his first trial.

884
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:16,319
The court said that the pain
that the victims had is unimaginable,

885
01:09:16,359 --> 01:09:19,260
and that Jung Ba Reum must be
isolated from society forever.

886
01:09:19,529 --> 01:09:22,359
Jung Ba Reum who used to be praised
as the national hero...

887
01:09:22,399 --> 01:09:25,670
confessed that he was the real killer
of the Mujin serial murders,

888
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:28,069
which shocked the whole nation.

889
01:09:37,850 --> 01:09:40,649
Murderer Jung Ba Reum forewent his appeal.

890
01:09:41,319 --> 01:09:44,220
Thus, his death sentence
has been finalized.

891
01:10:04,569 --> 01:10:06,939
(6 months later)

892
01:10:07,109 --> 01:10:09,409
(Genuine Correction, A Bright Future)

893
01:10:47,510 --> 01:10:48,720
(Establish the law and order.)

894
01:10:48,750 --> 01:10:49,779
Is he here?

895
01:10:50,850 --> 01:10:51,989
There he is.

896
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:06,000
That's it. He got that look back
on his face.

897
01:11:19,010 --> 01:11:20,250
Your food is here.

898
01:11:27,859 --> 01:11:31,060
You're the only one who survived
among those whom I planned to kill.

899
01:11:32,329 --> 01:11:34,529
You remember how your friend
Kim Byeong Tae died, right?

900
01:11:35,460 --> 01:11:37,199
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

901
01:11:38,569 --> 01:11:39,670
Look forward to it.

902
01:11:45,609 --> 01:11:47,539
Officer! Officer!

903
01:11:47,569 --> 01:11:49,180
(You can start anew if you have a dream.)

904
01:11:50,279 --> 01:11:51,279
(Walk in a straight line.)

905
01:11:57,989 --> 01:11:59,449
Did you threaten him?

906
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:01,760
That you'd kill him?

907
01:12:02,220 --> 01:12:03,689
That rat.

908
01:12:04,689 --> 01:12:06,789
Did he tell you as soon as he left?

909
01:12:09,729 --> 01:12:10,930
Do you still call yourself human?

910
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:12,930
How could you...

911
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:14,470
Why did you apply to work here?

912
01:12:15,199 --> 01:12:16,300
Did you...

913
01:12:17,810 --> 01:12:20,569
miss me? Is that the reason?

914
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:23,539
Did you want to see me?

915
01:12:24,649 --> 01:12:25,710
That's right.

916
01:12:26,779 --> 01:12:29,449
I applied to work here
to ask you a question.

917
01:12:30,220 --> 01:12:31,850
How could you do that?

918
01:12:32,149 --> 01:12:34,520
How could you do that
to none other than Chi Gook?

919
01:12:35,189 --> 01:12:38,130
To Bong Yi's grandmother and to Father Go?

920
01:12:38,630 --> 01:12:41,229
How could you do that to them? How?

921
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:44,729
I'm a lion that just ate a few mice.

922
01:12:45,930 --> 01:12:47,000
What?

923
01:12:47,029 --> 01:12:49,340
Don't you want to know
why I didn't kill you?

924
01:12:50,739 --> 01:12:54,609
It's because you weren't even
worth killing, you jerk.

925
01:13:08,590 --> 01:13:09,659
You scumbag.

926
01:13:18,399 --> 01:13:19,529
You scumbag.

927
01:13:20,430 --> 01:13:22,640
We have a situation in Room Seven.

928
01:13:22,670 --> 01:13:24,239
- Let's go.
- We have a situation in Room Seven.

929
01:13:31,210 --> 01:13:32,279
There they are.

930
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:33,880
- What are you doing?
- Hands off.

931
01:13:38,220 --> 01:13:39,319
Are you all right?

932
01:13:51,199 --> 01:13:52,800
The weather is nice.

933
01:13:54,130 --> 01:13:56,899
I'm sad that I can't go out
to see flowers on this beautiful day.

934
01:14:10,180 --> 01:14:11,590
I missed you, Father.

935
01:14:27,229 --> 01:14:28,340
Right.

936
01:14:29,069 --> 01:14:31,409
I knew it when I saw your eyes.

937
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:36,979
That you have a superior gene
just like I do.

938
01:14:38,079 --> 01:14:39,149
Other than that,

939
01:14:40,609 --> 01:14:41,979
do you have anything...

940
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:44,149
to say to me?

941
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:47,319
When I found out that you were my son,

942
01:14:48,060 --> 01:14:49,359
I was very happy.

943
01:14:50,159 --> 01:14:51,930
I was proud of you.

944
01:14:53,159 --> 01:14:57,399
Don't forget that we were born
superior to normal people.

945
01:14:58,199 --> 01:15:00,000
Never change that again.

946
01:15:00,899 --> 01:15:02,000
That look in your eyes.

947
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:29,600
Don't you worry.

948
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:33,369
We will get out of here eventually.

949
01:15:36,039 --> 01:15:37,140
I suppose...

950
01:15:40,170 --> 01:15:41,380
that would be best.

951
01:15:42,409 --> 01:15:43,479
Of course.

952
01:15:44,439 --> 01:15:47,850
I got it all planned out.

953
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:26,390
Dong Goo, listen to me.

954
01:16:27,550 --> 01:16:28,619
Goo Dong Goo!

955
01:16:30,489 --> 01:16:33,489
When the right time comes,
open the door of Han Seo Joon's cell.

956
01:16:33,930 --> 01:16:35,000
I...

957
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:38,829
I have to put an end to this.

958
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:22,539
Breaking news. Headhunter, Han Seo Joon,
was found with his throat slit.

959
01:17:23,109 --> 01:17:24,880
Just like how you killed my mom
in front of my eyes,

960
01:17:25,050 --> 01:17:27,609
I should kill you
in front of your kid as well.

961
01:17:28,479 --> 01:17:30,949
Han Seo Joon. I will kill you.

962
01:17:31,350 --> 01:17:32,890
In the worst way possible.

963
01:17:32,989 --> 01:17:34,420
Keep your promise, Jung Ba Reum.

964
01:17:35,020 --> 01:17:36,560
The promise you made to Go Mu Chi.

965
01:17:41,460 --> 01:17:42,930
(Headhunter's Throat Has Been Slit!)

966
01:18:20,529 --> 01:18:21,699
What's wrong?

967
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:26,369
Please... Please kill me.

968
01:18:26,770 --> 01:18:28,539
Just kill me, please!

969
01:18:58,939 --> 01:19:00,409
I visited my wife.

970
01:19:06,909 --> 01:19:10,720
Jung Ba Reum will die soon.

971
01:19:11,949 --> 01:19:12,989
What?

972
01:19:13,090 --> 01:19:14,750
It's an aftereffect of his brain surgery.

973
01:19:15,390 --> 01:19:18,460
The prison guard says
it's unbearable to watch him.

974
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:21,329
He must be feeling excruciating pain.

975
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:25,399
Ba Reum said it felt like
a mouse was nibbling at his brain.

976
01:19:27,569 --> 01:19:29,340
That's not enough for that son of a gun.

977
01:19:29,770 --> 01:19:31,939
He deserves much more agony.

978
01:19:36,739 --> 01:19:39,449
I know you have something to tell him.

979
01:19:40,979 --> 01:19:42,949
- Before he dies, you should...
- No.

980
01:19:43,479 --> 01:19:44,850
Why would I visit him?

981
01:19:52,989 --> 01:19:55,460
- Sit down.
- Ma'am.

982
01:19:55,829 --> 01:19:59,130
Why did you drink so much?

983
01:19:59,699 --> 01:20:02,100
You could die.

984
01:20:04,039 --> 01:20:05,170
Ma'am.

985
01:20:07,210 --> 01:20:09,310
I have something to ask you.

986
01:20:10,310 --> 01:20:11,779
You said you forgave...

987
01:20:12,579 --> 01:20:14,250
that psychopath and his son.

988
01:20:14,649 --> 01:20:17,079
How did you do that? Did you go mad?

989
01:20:17,949 --> 01:20:20,449
I didn't forgive them...

990
01:20:21,420 --> 01:20:23,289
for their sakes.

991
01:20:24,789 --> 01:20:26,430
It was for me.

992
01:20:27,460 --> 01:20:30,029
If I didn't, I thought I'd die.

993
01:20:32,970 --> 01:20:35,800
Listening to Father Go,

994
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,869
I could feel his pain...

995
01:20:40,510 --> 01:20:42,380
and weariness.

996
01:20:44,510 --> 01:20:48,250
I could also feel mine as well.

997
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:56,020
That's when I let go.

998
01:20:56,720 --> 01:20:58,260
"I should forgive them."

999
01:20:59,590 --> 01:21:02,100
"My kids wouldn't want me dead."

1000
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,600
"I should hang in there and live well
for their sakes."

1001
01:21:07,329 --> 01:21:11,569
After that, I slept for days on end.

1002
01:21:12,409 --> 01:21:14,310
Then when I opened my eyes,

1003
01:21:15,279 --> 01:21:17,409
I found the desire to live.

1004
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:23,720
And then, I was able to face...

1005
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:26,789
my kids.

1006
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:30,819
That's nonsense.

1007
01:21:32,859 --> 01:21:34,090
I will never forgive them.

1008
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:38,500
Of course. I understand.

1009
01:21:39,470 --> 01:21:40,930
Those who are left behind...

1010
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:44,600
must endure and live on in our own ways.

1011
01:21:47,869 --> 01:21:49,380
But here's what's important.

1012
01:21:51,279 --> 01:21:54,880
We must pull through.

1013
01:21:57,449 --> 01:22:02,789
I hope you will break free
from this agony...

1014
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:06,859
and find the will to live on.

1015
01:22:08,659 --> 01:22:10,930
That's what your brother had wanted
as well.

1016
01:23:07,420 --> 01:23:08,619
You're lucky.

1017
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:12,659
I heard you're dying. Darn it.

1018
01:23:13,229 --> 01:23:16,199
I ought to slice your throat myself.

1019
01:23:19,170 --> 01:23:20,300
I came to see...

1020
01:23:21,270 --> 01:23:23,069
what kind of mess you're in.

1021
01:23:26,340 --> 01:23:29,079
Do you think I'll forgive you
since you killed your dad?

1022
01:23:29,710 --> 01:23:31,340
Dream on.

1023
01:23:40,020 --> 01:23:41,289
I'm sorry.

1024
01:23:43,619 --> 01:23:45,029
And...

1025
01:23:49,130 --> 01:23:50,329
thank you always.

1026
01:23:53,829 --> 01:23:55,699
Someone who commits murder...

1027
01:23:55,970 --> 01:23:58,000
has empty eyes.

1028
01:23:59,510 --> 01:24:02,640
But your eyes are full...

1029
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:07,050
of rage, pain, regret,

1030
01:24:08,779 --> 01:24:09,850
and love.

1031
01:24:10,149 --> 01:24:13,789
I finally understand what it means
to have eyes full of emotions.

1032
01:24:15,159 --> 01:24:18,760
This son of a gun also feels pain.

1033
01:24:20,289 --> 01:24:22,199
I know it's shameless of me,
but I have a favor to ask.

1034
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,770
Please use all the money
that's under my name...

1035
01:24:28,199 --> 01:24:30,399
for the bereaved families.

1036
01:24:32,810 --> 01:24:35,680
That's not going to make your sins
any lighter.

1037
01:24:37,579 --> 01:24:39,079
And lastly,

1038
01:24:41,510 --> 01:24:42,649
Bong Yi.

1039
01:24:50,159 --> 01:24:52,090
I'd like to see Bong Yi.

1040
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:58,029
You brazen scumbag.

1041
01:24:58,500 --> 01:24:59,800
Do you think she'd want to see you?

1042
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:10,640
Goodness.

1043
01:25:16,220 --> 01:25:17,319
I heard you're dying.

1044
01:25:20,220 --> 01:25:23,489
That's the only reason why I came.

1045
01:25:27,329 --> 01:25:29,430
It's unfair for you...

1046
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:31,970
to take the easy way out.

1047
01:25:33,869 --> 01:25:35,470
A scumbag like you...

1048
01:25:37,439 --> 01:25:39,670
should be stabbed in the stomach,

1049
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:43,710
burned alive,

1050
01:25:45,149 --> 01:25:46,949
have your lungs pulled out,

1051
01:25:48,409 --> 01:25:50,420
and have stones in your stomach.

1052
01:25:50,819 --> 01:25:51,890
That's how...

1053
01:25:58,930 --> 01:26:00,090
What do you need to tell me?

1054
01:26:01,590 --> 01:26:03,829
Why did you tell me to come
all the way here?

1055
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:08,270
I'm sorry.

1056
01:26:12,510 --> 01:26:13,810
I wanted to tell you that.

1057
01:26:21,279 --> 01:26:22,350
I will...

1058
01:26:23,750 --> 01:26:25,250
never forgive you...

1059
01:26:25,989 --> 01:26:27,449
until the day I die.

1060
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:31,189
I'll curse you until my very last breath.

1061
01:26:33,430 --> 01:26:34,760
I came here to tell you that.

1062
01:26:37,100 --> 01:26:38,399
In the next life,

1063
01:26:43,069 --> 01:26:45,310
I'll be a normal person.

1064
01:26:51,210 --> 01:26:52,449
Then...

1065
01:26:58,279 --> 01:26:59,390
Then...

1066
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:11,130
(Visiting Room)

1067
01:28:35,979 --> 01:28:37,119
I was...

1068
01:28:38,079 --> 01:28:39,750
born a monster.

1069
01:28:41,489 --> 01:28:42,619
Please...

1070
01:28:43,989 --> 01:28:45,960
don't let me become a monster.

1071
01:28:47,590 --> 01:28:48,699
Please don't.

1072
01:29:10,579 --> 01:29:11,779
The deity...

1073
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:15,520
answered your prayer.

1074
01:29:28,939 --> 01:29:30,170
You're no longer...

1075
01:29:33,539 --> 01:29:34,739
a monster.

1076
01:30:16,680 --> 01:30:18,850
(3 years later)

1077
01:30:18,890 --> 01:30:20,619
- Do not release!
- Do not release!

1078
01:30:20,649 --> 01:30:21,890
- Do not release!
- This is breaking news.

1079
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:26,260
President Shin Sung Min pardoned
ex-Chief Secretary Choi Young Shin...

1080
01:30:26,289 --> 01:30:27,689
against public sentiment.

1081
01:30:27,859 --> 01:30:30,029
He announced that
to bring society together,

1082
01:30:30,060 --> 01:30:32,130
her pardon is a must.

1083
01:30:32,199 --> 01:30:33,800
- Do not release!
- Do not release!

1084
01:30:33,829 --> 01:30:35,470
- Do not release!
- Do not release!

1085
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:37,199
- Do not release!
- Do not release!

1086
01:30:37,239 --> 01:30:38,810
- Do not release!
- Do not release!

1087
01:30:38,840 --> 01:30:40,539
- Do not release!
- Do not release!

1088
01:30:40,569 --> 01:30:42,069
- Do not release!
- Do not release!

1089
01:30:42,109 --> 01:30:43,739
- Do not release!
- Do not release!

1090
01:30:43,779 --> 01:30:45,409
- Do not release!
- Do not release!

1091
01:30:45,439 --> 01:30:47,079
- Do not release!
- Do not release!

1092
01:30:47,109 --> 01:30:48,779
- Do not release!
- Do not release!

1093
01:30:48,819 --> 01:30:49,850
Mom.

1094
01:30:50,850 --> 01:30:53,220
Eun Chong. Come here.

1095
01:31:01,960 --> 01:31:03,699
- Have you been well?
- Yes.

1096
01:31:10,939 --> 01:31:12,869
Ex-Chief Secretary
Choi Young Shin's pardon...

1097
01:31:12,909 --> 01:31:16,609
angered the public and the President's
approval rating dropped.

1098
01:31:42,939 --> 01:31:44,770
Fresh eggs.

1099
01:31:44,899 --> 01:31:46,109
Buy eggs.

1100
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:48,670
Oh Bong Yi, eggs!

1101
01:31:48,739 --> 01:31:50,680
Get up, you have lectures to attend!

1102
01:31:50,779 --> 01:31:52,350
The sun's been long up!

1103
01:31:52,380 --> 01:31:54,850
- Darn it.
- Wake up! Go to class!

1104
01:31:55,250 --> 01:31:57,420
- Enjoy them.
- I will, thanks.

1105
01:31:57,449 --> 01:32:00,649
- Don't make such a noise so early.
- Do you know what time it is?

1106
01:32:00,689 --> 01:32:03,359
Do you know how many eggs
I must sell to pay your tuition?

1107
01:32:03,390 --> 01:32:05,060
I'll pay you back.

1108
01:32:05,090 --> 01:32:07,430
I told you I won't go to college.

1109
01:32:07,560 --> 01:32:10,399
I can't work and go to class
when I have just one body.

1110
01:32:10,430 --> 01:32:11,800
(8 dollars for 30 fresh eggs)

1111
01:32:16,439 --> 01:32:19,170
Mr. Go. I got asked to be...

1112
01:32:19,409 --> 01:32:22,239
a lead writer on
a new current affairs program.

1113
01:32:23,609 --> 01:32:24,680
Wait and see.

1114
01:32:25,140 --> 01:32:26,609
When I become a lead writer,

1115
01:32:26,649 --> 01:32:29,750
I'll create a fair and just society...

1116
01:32:29,779 --> 01:32:31,850
- so no one's unfairly...
- Hang on, let's see.

1117
01:32:31,979 --> 01:32:34,390
There's your tuition and the interest.

1118
01:32:34,420 --> 01:32:36,689
Will your salary go up
if you become a lead writer?

1119
01:32:36,720 --> 01:32:37,960
Are you a loan shark?

1120
01:32:38,590 --> 01:32:39,930
My gosh.

1121
01:32:43,560 --> 01:32:46,069
- What's this?
- Don't.

1122
01:32:47,100 --> 01:32:48,470
It's for me.

1123
01:32:48,670 --> 01:32:51,069
You hate beans as much as carrots.

1124
01:32:53,140 --> 01:32:55,239
I bet she got out by now.

1125
01:32:55,810 --> 01:32:56,880
Who?

1126
01:32:57,109 --> 01:32:58,779
Do you take me for a fool?

1127
01:32:59,180 --> 01:33:00,479
Go and see her.

1128
01:33:00,579 --> 01:33:02,720
Apologize for what you feel sorry for.

1129
01:33:02,750 --> 01:33:05,890
- Talk to her face and...
- Eggs, fresh eggs.

1130
01:33:06,250 --> 01:33:08,619
- Be a man and face her...
- Large...

1131
01:33:08,689 --> 01:33:11,119
and fresh eggs at your doorstep.

1132
01:33:11,359 --> 01:33:14,289
No one uses that nowadays.
Everyone plays a recording.

1133
01:33:14,329 --> 01:33:16,159
A loudspeaker is so old-fashioned.

1134
01:33:17,100 --> 01:33:19,329
Youngsters these days know
nothing about romance.

1135
01:33:19,369 --> 01:33:20,470
Don't you know retro?

1136
01:33:21,199 --> 01:33:23,000
Drop me off at a supermarket.

1137
01:33:23,369 --> 01:33:25,939
- Why?
- I invited Ms. Choi's family...

1138
01:33:25,970 --> 01:33:27,239
to dinner today.

1139
01:33:27,409 --> 01:33:29,079
Dong Goo will come too.

1140
01:33:29,979 --> 01:33:31,140
You're welcome too.

1141
01:33:31,640 --> 01:33:32,779
I can't show up.

1142
01:33:33,409 --> 01:33:34,510
Not after what I did.

1143
01:33:36,119 --> 01:33:39,420
I bought the japchae and pork.

1144
01:33:41,050 --> 01:33:42,119
What else?

1145
01:33:53,069 --> 01:33:54,130
Right.

1146
01:33:54,170 --> 01:33:56,640
I'll get sweet and sour chicken
since the kids like that.

1147
01:34:30,399 --> 01:34:31,539
- I'm...
- I'm sorry.

1148
01:34:36,539 --> 01:34:38,010
It wasn't your fault.

1149
01:34:39,279 --> 01:34:40,850
I didn't trust him.

1150
01:34:42,010 --> 01:34:43,079
It was me.

1151
01:34:43,649 --> 01:34:47,189
We both wronged Sung Yo Han
beyond forgiveness.

1152
01:34:48,350 --> 01:34:49,390
Yes.

1153
01:34:50,619 --> 01:34:52,430
I'll make up for it
for the rest of my life.

1154
01:34:53,460 --> 01:34:54,529
Me too.

1155
01:34:58,229 --> 01:35:00,430
I hope you can be happy.

1156
01:35:03,869 --> 01:35:04,970
You too.

1157
01:35:07,909 --> 01:35:11,340
I'll try, for Eun Chong's sake.

1158
01:35:18,680 --> 01:35:19,819
I should go.

1159
01:35:29,659 --> 01:35:30,859
Jae Hee.

1160
01:35:31,460 --> 01:35:32,500
Eun Chong.

1161
01:35:32,699 --> 01:35:34,369
What are you doing here?

1162
01:35:36,899 --> 01:35:38,000
It's a bird.

1163
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:40,569
It flew from over there.

1164
01:35:40,640 --> 01:35:42,039
Did it?

1165
01:35:43,210 --> 01:35:44,640
It's cute.

1166
01:35:47,079 --> 01:35:49,649
Shall I give it a name?

1167
01:35:49,680 --> 01:35:50,750
Yes.

1168
01:35:52,079 --> 01:35:54,119
How about Eo Beong Yi?

1169
01:35:54,189 --> 01:35:55,449
I like Eo Beong Yi.

1170
01:35:55,960 --> 01:35:57,659
- It sounds cute.
- Does it?

1171
01:35:58,060 --> 01:35:59,359
Eo Beong Yi.

1172
01:36:00,060 --> 01:36:01,430
Eo Beong Yi.

1173
01:36:02,189 --> 01:36:04,899
I like Eo Beong Yi. Eo Beong Yi's cute.

1174
01:36:13,039 --> 01:36:14,770
Come get your eggs.

1175
01:36:15,109 --> 01:36:18,180
Large eggs straight from the farm.

1176
01:36:19,409 --> 01:36:22,479
Eggs, come and get your eggs.

1177
01:36:23,579 --> 01:36:26,250
There was a monster
that could never be saved.

1178
01:36:27,619 --> 01:36:30,420
The deity gave that monster emotions.

1179
01:36:31,220 --> 01:36:34,930
The deity answered your prayer.

1180
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,300
You're no longer...

1181
01:36:40,600 --> 01:36:41,800
a monster.

1182
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:19,770
In the end,

1183
01:37:22,039 --> 01:37:25,609
he died in excruciating pain and agony
while repenting for his sins.

1184
01:37:28,279 --> 01:37:30,449
(Jung Ba Reum)

1185
01:37:34,020 --> 01:37:35,250
Was he punished...

1186
01:37:36,420 --> 01:37:38,590
by the deity?

1187
01:37:39,529 --> 01:37:43,229
Or was he saved?

1188
01:38:12,289 --> 01:38:19,300
(Jung Ba Reum)

1189
01:39:00,210 --> 01:39:02,840
(Mouse)

1190
01:39:03,479 --> 01:39:06,010
(Thank you, Kim Yo Han and Pyo Chang Won,
for your special appearance.)

1191
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:45,680
(Thank you for watching Mouse.)
