(The animal scenes are CGI.)

11
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:12,010
Darn it. I needed offspring.

12
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:13,849
A junior, just like me.

13
00:01:14,349 --> 00:01:17,750
If that child grows up
to be like Han Seo Joon...

14
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,760
No. Don't.

15
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:43,810
You...

16
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,310
decided to keep it.

17
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:50,480
I'm afraid.

18
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,120
I saw a monster.

19
00:01:59,859 --> 00:02:00,959
If my child...

20
00:02:02,829 --> 00:02:04,659
becomes a monster like him,

21
00:02:05,329 --> 00:02:06,700
what then?

(Episode 19)

24
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,830
Look who's here.

25
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,030
Where is she?

26
00:02:41,469 --> 00:02:42,629
Tell me where she is.

27
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:50,069
Who?

28
00:02:50,509 --> 00:02:52,680
That detective has your grandson.

29
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,449
He said he'll kill him
if you don't give him his daughter.

30
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:57,819
Where is she? Give her to him!

31
00:02:58,419 --> 00:02:59,580
A grandson?

32
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,719
I don't have a grandson.

33
00:03:02,189 --> 00:03:03,960
You said you killed our Blessing.

34
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,520
With your own hands
as soon as he was born.

35
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,530
I'm sorry.

36
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:16,469
I wronged you.

37
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,969
Please. He said he'll kill Yo Han's son.

38
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,009
Tell him to do what he wants.

39
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,240
He can kill him or whatever.

40
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:29,379
Don't say that. Help me, please.

41
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,580
Please. I beg of you.

42
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,949
Tell me where his daughter is.

43
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:36,020
He's your blood.

44
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,960
He's my blood?

45
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,729
He has nothing to do with me.

46
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,000
What?

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,900
It's what the whole nation wants.

48
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:55,310
Save Jung Ba Reum's life.

49
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,449
My hands are getting stiff.

50
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,240
It's the music...

51
00:05:04,709 --> 00:05:07,310
I always played for my Blessing.

52
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,050
I need to check.

53
00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:16,920
Tell the prison director
I changed my mind.

54
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:41,980
Wait here.

55
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,420
I'm sorry, Yo Han.

56
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,589
You must feel so betrayed.

57
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:28,129
I let you grow up as that monster's son.

58
00:06:30,329 --> 00:06:32,699
If only I hadn't made that decision,

59
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:35,670
you and your family, everyone...

60
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:38,240
would've lived happily ever after.

61
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:40,399
You dare deceive me?

62
00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:42,610
A fool like you?

63
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:44,279
Jung Ba Reum.

64
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,649
I should've killed him myself.

65
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,680
But I thought that monster
was just a child himself.

66
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,480
I was out of my mind.

67
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:56,490
I knew it. It was Jung Ba Reum.

68
00:06:57,689 --> 00:06:59,620
Then I must save his life.

69
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,660
He is Han Seo Joon's junior.

70
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,740
I need a live brain.

71
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,939
What do you mean you need a live brain?

72
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,339
You didn't say so before.

73
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,939
Where are we to find a live brain now?

74
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:18,139
You know where.

75
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,079
I want Sung Yo Han's brain.

76
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,350
What?

77
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,649
His vitals are back to normal.

78
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,149
He is recovering.

79
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:30,250
Of all the people in the world,

80
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:33,189
those who wish for him to recover...

81
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,689
- are very few.
- But still.

82
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:37,560
He is your son.

83
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:40,899
Shouldn't he do one good deed?

84
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,939
My Yo Han...

85
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:47,100
would want to atone for what he did.

86
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:49,740
Still, how could you...

87
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:53,779
Then I'll call off this surgery.

88
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:56,750
No, wait.

89
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:11,899
You took... You took his brain...

90
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,230
when he was alive?

91
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,470
You killed Yo Han?

92
00:08:21,269 --> 00:08:24,540
You didn't know? You acted so maternally.

93
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,439
How did you not notice?

94
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,350
How...

95
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,889
Darn you!

96
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:39,659
You murderer! Bring him back!

97
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,730
Bring back my son!

98
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:44,730
Stop it. I did bring your son back.

99
00:08:44,929 --> 00:08:46,259
Jung Ba Reum.

100
00:08:50,269 --> 00:08:53,340
This is how I repaid you
for what you did to me.

101
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:57,639
Sung Ji Eun. You killed Sung Yo Han.

102
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:12,360
I'll kill you!

103
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,600
Before Na Chi Gook's incident,

104
00:09:21,629 --> 00:09:23,870
didn't you collect blood from the inmates
because of an HIV-positive inmate?

105
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:26,039
Yes. Why do you ask?

106
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:28,809
When Sung Yo Han came,
were the blood samples still here?

107
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,009
One minute.

108
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:32,809
That incident occurred on...

109
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:34,350
You're right.

110
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:36,549
The samples were sent out the day after.

111
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,519
Was Han Seo Joon's blood normal?

112
00:09:38,549 --> 00:09:39,779
Han Seo Joon?

113
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:41,850
Hold on.

114
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:45,419
The facility said some of the samples...

115
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:47,529
were too contaminated to examine.

116
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:49,429
And his blood was also on the list.

117
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:51,200
They couldn't examine the samples?

118
00:09:51,429 --> 00:09:53,500
Perhaps, they were contaminated
by foreign substances...

119
00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:55,269
or the amount of blood was insufficient.

120
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:59,470
Were you away the day
Sung Yo Han had come here?

121
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:03,240
Yes. But there was an emergency situation,
and I was away from my station.

122
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,039
He had come here
to collect Han Seo Joon's blood.

123
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,679
Sung Yo Han wasn't Han Seo Joon's son.

124
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,480
What is this?

125
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:16,289
He brought a strand of hair
and asked if the two were related.

126
00:10:17,389 --> 00:10:19,889
(The subjects are mother and son.)

127
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,470
Don't cry.

128
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,539
Don't cry.

129
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:40,879
"Jae Hee. In this world,"

130
00:10:41,049 --> 00:10:42,710
"it's just you and me."

131
00:10:44,149 --> 00:10:45,220
What?

132
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,750
"You are..."

133
00:10:47,889 --> 00:10:50,090
- "the only family I have left."
- The only family I have left.

134
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:53,789
It's just...

135
00:10:55,289 --> 00:10:56,629
you and me.

136
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,070
I have something...

137
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:04,500
I must do.

138
00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:08,570
Once I'm done,

139
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,580
I'll come back for you.

140
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,450
Let's live...

141
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:16,580
happily ever after.

142
00:11:19,549 --> 00:11:21,519
I do hope...

143
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:25,889
that Yo Han's nature
won't overpower yours.

144
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:28,830
I was...

145
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,600
I was Han Seo Joon's son.

146
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:37,399
And he was aware of this.

147
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,669
He took Yo Han's life in order to save me.

148
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:44,580
Did you implant that murderer
Sung Yo Han's brain in here?

149
00:11:48,549 --> 00:11:52,179
You must live a kind...

150
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:55,250
and righteous life.

151
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:57,789
My baby.

152
00:13:11,929 --> 00:13:13,029
You saw it.

153
00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:19,070
Poor you.

154
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,539
You dumped me.

155
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:26,009
Why would you suddenly show me affection?

156
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:29,909
Why are you here?

157
00:13:34,549 --> 00:13:35,990
Mr. Go...

158
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:40,590
seems to have found out
that you killed Kang Deok Soo.

159
00:13:41,929 --> 00:13:43,230
I came here to tell you that.

160
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,129
I came clean.

161
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:48,769
I see.

162
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,940
Then I shouldn't have come.

163
00:13:53,169 --> 00:13:54,509
That was why I was here.

164
00:13:56,539 --> 00:13:57,580
I'll get going then.

165
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,730
No.

166
00:14:53,929 --> 00:14:55,669
He can't be the only one...

167
00:14:56,799 --> 00:14:58,100
with a scar on his arm.

168
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:00,470
No. It can't be him.

169
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:02,309
No.

170
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:04,309
It can't be.

171
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:13,919
I saw a monster.

172
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:16,750
I saw him push...

173
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:19,759
his own mother out the window.

174
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:23,990
But I couldn't say anything.

175
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,860
I couldn't even report it.

176
00:15:28,169 --> 00:15:30,129
We must end it...

177
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:33,200
before more tragedies befall.

178
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:37,679
What do you mean?

179
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:46,980
Brace yourself.

180
00:15:48,549 --> 00:15:50,019
Keep an eye on my baby.

181
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,129
If you think he'll turn into a monster,

182
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,429
kill him.

183
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:06,940
Please...

184
00:16:08,169 --> 00:16:09,309
take good care...

185
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,240
of my baby.

186
00:16:13,409 --> 00:16:15,210
Yo Han...

187
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,360
Hello.

188
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:27,519
Goodness.

189
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,129
Did you find your baby?

190
00:16:30,259 --> 00:16:32,299
Sorry? What do you mean?

191
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:35,669
A baby. Did you receive any reports
about a missing baby?

192
00:16:35,769 --> 00:16:37,269
- A missing baby?
- Yes.

193
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,370
No.

194
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,309
Yesterday, a woman got into an accident
while carrying a baby.

195
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,110
May I check the CCTV?

196
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:51,450
Here. Please zoom in here.

197
00:16:59,289 --> 00:17:00,419
How's my baby?

198
00:17:00,889 --> 00:17:03,289
Don't worry. He's unscathed.

199
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:06,730
- Okay.
- But his guardian isn't doing too well.

200
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:11,299
She was gravely injured
while trying to protect him.

201
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:44,000
Mom.

202
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:46,940
Mom.

203
00:17:55,309 --> 00:17:56,380
I'm sorry.

204
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:59,819
I'm sorry, Mom.

205
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,500
Mom.

206
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,799
Mom, are you awake?

207
00:18:22,009 --> 00:18:23,069
Mom.

208
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,210
Mom, I'm sorry. I was wrong.

209
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,849
I...

210
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,779
I left Hyeon Seok...

211
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:34,750
there alone.

212
00:18:36,019 --> 00:18:37,349
Because I was scared.

213
00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:41,859
Because of me...

214
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,559
Because of me, he died.

215
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,470
I didn't think I could see you and Dad.

216
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,740
I missed you guys so much,
but I couldn't come to see you.

217
00:18:55,609 --> 00:18:56,640
Mom.

218
00:19:00,779 --> 00:19:01,809
Mom.

219
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:24,130
Hello?

220
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,970
I'm sorry, Ms. Choi.

221
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:29,210
Your baby... Your baby...

222
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,940
He took your baby.

223
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:32,779
Who did?

224
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:34,309
What?

225
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,410
My dad?

226
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:40,049
No. No.

227
00:19:57,069 --> 00:19:58,200
Eun Chong.

228
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:04,779
Are you the mother of this baby?

229
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:08,349
Yes, I am.

230
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:18,619
I'm sorry.

231
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:21,059
My wife...

232
00:20:21,859 --> 00:20:23,160
She's very sick.

233
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:25,900
I think that's why she took the baby.

234
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:28,900
I apologize.

235
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:35,410
If you want her to be punished...

236
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:38,940
I'll take the punishment instead.

237
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:52,589
Eun Chong.

238
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:02,130
Dad.

239
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:09,470
Eun Chong.

240
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:21,519
Sung Yo Han had gone there to get
Han Seo Joon's blood,

241
00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:23,049
not to kill Chi Gook.

242
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,089
If he's not the killer...

243
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:29,960
- We carried the box to the auditorium.
- Done.

244
00:21:30,029 --> 00:21:33,130
How did the killer carry
an unconscious, adult male...

245
00:21:33,529 --> 00:21:35,529
all the way to the box in the auditorium?

246
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:38,440
- We chatted and said goodbye.
- Do well. Don't be scared.

247
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,200
What if the box was here from the get-go?

248
00:21:41,339 --> 00:21:42,769
- Chi Gook left,
- See you later.

249
00:21:42,809 --> 00:21:44,269
and I carried the box in.

250
00:21:44,339 --> 00:21:46,440
What if this was where the killer put
Chi Gook inside the box?

251
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,450
There's a mirror
that's positioned diagonally.

252
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:54,079
A person will be hiding behind the mirror.

253
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:56,150
I have nothing else
but Ba Reum's statements.

254
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,119
I put it in this corner
as soon as I came in.

255
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,559
What if he lied to me?

256
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:02,160
Oh, I forgot that
I left once to have lunch.

257
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:04,660
But why would he? He has no reason to.

258
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:06,859
I was the one...

259
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:16,670
What if he was the one who did it?

260
00:22:22,779 --> 00:22:25,119
Kim Joon Sung said he had hacked
into Finance Team Three's system.

263
00:22:28,349 --> 00:22:29,519
Finance Team Three?

264
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:31,960
There are only two finance teams.

265
00:22:32,619 --> 00:22:33,859
Pardon?

266
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:38,099
What are you doing here?
You never came to a cafe.

267
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:42,329
I had no choice. The commissioner said
I should stay out of his sight...

268
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,529
and keep myself 100m away
from the police station.

269
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:46,240
You shouldn't have beat him up.

270
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,509
By the way...

271
00:22:50,339 --> 00:22:52,640
It's not Officer Jung, right?

272
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:58,009
I tried to view it
from a psychological perspective,

273
00:22:58,079 --> 00:22:59,849
but Officer Jung...

274
00:23:01,049 --> 00:23:02,319
There's no way he did it.

275
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:03,589
Hey, the thing is...

276
00:23:10,329 --> 00:23:11,329
Never mind.

277
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:15,029
Gosh. Why won't you finish
what you were saying? I hate that.

278
00:23:15,099 --> 00:23:16,970
- Shut it. Did you bring it?
- No, I didn't.

279
00:23:20,769 --> 00:23:22,970
You know that it's illegal
to take out evidence photos, right?

280
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:26,740
The election is just around the corner.
Well, my dad has no chance anyway.

281
00:23:29,609 --> 00:23:31,579
The sole is removed
just like in this photo.

282
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,579
And it's the same size.

(Resignation, Corporal, Lee Min Soo,

286
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,069
He quit? Through an email?

287
00:23:49,369 --> 00:23:51,069
What an impudent scumbag.
He even quit like that?

288
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:53,240
Seeing that Mu Chi caused that commotion,

289
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:55,240
and that Detective Lee resigned,

290
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:57,710
I think we should look into
Jung Ba Reum properly.

291
00:23:57,869 --> 00:24:01,240
Secretly check where Jung Ba Reum was
around the time of the murders...

Yes, sir.

00:24:11,019 --> 00:24:12,319
I wanted to see him so bad.

295
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:16,529
I really wanted to see Yo Han's baby.

296

I'm sorry.

297
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:21,799
You know, right?

298
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:25,069
What pain your son lived with.

299
00:24:27,869 --> 00:24:29,839
He even tried to end his own life...

300
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,480
only because he's Han Seo Joon's son.

301
00:24:33,309 --> 00:24:34,339
You know that well, right?

302
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:36,779
There's something you must know.

303
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:39,450
What is it?

304
00:24:39,549 --> 00:24:42,720
Han Seo Joon's son
is actually Jung Ba Reum.

305
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,029
What do you mean by that?

306
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:52,430
I saw Jung Ba Reum
wearing the baby clothes...

307
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,029
that my mother made by herself.

308
00:24:56,769 --> 00:24:58,029
How did that happen?

309
00:24:59,069 --> 00:25:00,400
I think their mothers...

310
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:04,240
You just watched Yo Han
living with pain every day.

312

I won't do that to my son.

313

I won't...

314
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:17,589
let my son live as a murder's child.

315
00:25:22,589 --> 00:25:23,859
I'll put everything back...

316

to where they belong.

317
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:51,619
I was sad that you left like that
last time.

I'm glad to see you again.

319

Oh, right. What happened to your baby?

320
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:01,900
Did your father kill him?

My dad isn't a monster like you.

322

I'm disappointed.

323
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:09,339
I guess your father is not like you.

00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:16,200
- No!
- How could you?

337
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,369
No!

338
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,170
I didn't do it.

339
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,339
How will you explain the victim's head
appearing from the snowman?

340
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,940
You should've killed me then.

341
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:38,319
Then Go Mu Chi
wouldn't have lost his mind,

342
00:28:38,619 --> 00:28:40,160
and your child...

343
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:42,930
would still have a father.

344
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:47,559
Don't you want to know
why I'm here to see you?

345
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,000
Han Seo Joon.

346
00:28:56,339 --> 00:28:57,740
I will kill you.

347
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:00,579
In the worst way possible.

348
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:05,319
How?

349
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:12,660
Look forward to it.

350
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,329
It'll be more than you imagine.

351
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,630
More than what I imagine?

352
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:31,980
Finance Team Three?

353
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,039
We only have Finance Teams 1 and 2.

354
00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:45,190
The first message.

355
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,259
Yo Han, it's Joon Sung.

356
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:49,160
The thing you asked me to look into.

357
00:29:49,259 --> 00:29:50,589
I'm scared.

358
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,299
I think I made a mistake.

359
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,660
It's a group called OZ.

360
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,069
(Codes and Hacking)

361
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,119
(All Books)

362
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:17,750
(Nyang Nyang...)

363
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:21,990
(Gluttony, envy)

364
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,829
(Sloth, ax)

365
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:28,869
(Shower facility, pride)

366
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,869
(I am the deity.)

367
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:30,900
(Wrath)

368
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:34,369
No. It can't be.

369
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,670
How could it be Jung Ba Reum?

370
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:38,740
He just happens to wear shoes
that are the same size.

371
00:30:39,509 --> 00:30:41,240
He's not the only person who does.

372
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:54,819
It's not right.

373
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,390
I just need to find proof it's not him.

374
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:00,730
I'll find it.

375
00:31:05,269 --> 00:31:08,740
Why did Sung Yo Han kill my grandma?

376
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:10,470
I think it was over a photo.

377
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:13,779
She held to it tight
until the moment she died.

378
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:15,450
A photo?

379
00:31:16,809 --> 00:31:19,549
Your grandma took a photo
from Sung Yo Han's home.

380
00:31:19,779 --> 00:31:22,589
It was a photo of Cho Mi Jeong's corpse.

381
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,269
Bong Yi.

382
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:44,069
Here it was.

383
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:46,180
Mu Chi took it.

384
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:47,680
Come in, Bong Yi.

385
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:07,960
What did you say you were looking for?

386
00:32:10,369 --> 00:32:13,769
When my grandmother died,

387
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:18,069
she was holding a photo.
I want to see that.

388
00:32:18,109 --> 00:32:19,180
Oh, that?

389
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,549
Here it is.

390
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,849
Mu Chi stared that this for ages too.

391
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:31,750
Your grandmother burned her hand
trying to hold onto this.

392
00:32:42,269 --> 00:32:44,599
Good. This will do.

393
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,369
This was why.

394
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:48,769
Grandma saw this button.

395
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:52,339
He was afraid she'd identify him.

396
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,339
The punk.

397
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,150
Why? What is it?

398
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:00,119
It's nothing.

399
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:03,890
Not just this but...

400
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,059
I didn't get Grandma's brooch back.

401
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:34,180
Get out here. Show yourself, you scumbag!

402
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:39,359
Jung Ba Reum. Jung Ba Reum!

403
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,199
Did you name the cat?

404
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,869
Yes. Toto.

405
00:34:56,929 --> 00:35:00,369
That's what Dorothy's dog is called
in "The Wizard of Oz".

406
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:04,170
If you have any questions about
raising cats, ask Nyang Nyang's Cafe.

407
00:35:04,739 --> 00:35:06,409
(Raising a child with a cat)

408
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,480
(Nyang Nyang's)

409
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:12,619
(Raising a child with a cat)

410
00:35:12,949 --> 00:35:15,320
Mom went to Grandma's.

411
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:17,150
Yes, Jeju Island Grandma.

412
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,059
(Jeju Oyster Gukbap)

413
00:35:23,489 --> 00:35:25,360
- Mom!
- Yes, Hoon Seok?

414
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,900
Ba Reum's here.

415
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:40,139
Hoon Seok, I want to talk to your mom.

416
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,880
We can play together later.

417
00:35:42,139 --> 00:35:44,349
- Let's play now.
- Hoon Seok.

418
00:35:45,619 --> 00:35:47,119
Go and play at Seung Ho's.

419
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:49,349
Okay.

420
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:52,219
Ba Reum, you can't go away.

421
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:54,690
You have to play with me later.

422
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,610
What are you?

423
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:18,179
Who are you?

424
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,449
Tell me!

425
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:23,989
Seung Ho's not at home.

426
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:47,409
What are you really?

427
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:50,179
I was...

428
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:54,619
a competitive fencer
and was hired by the company.

429
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,849
Through an in-depth interview,

430
00:36:57,090 --> 00:37:00,059
I found out about
a special group called OZ.

431
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:02,360
I volunteered.

432
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,929
My first job...

433
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:06,030
(Jung Jae Hoon)

434
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,400
was to watch you, Jae Hoon.

435
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,199
(Jung Jae Hoon)

436
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:35,929
Song Soo Ho was my predecessor.

437
00:37:36,929 --> 00:37:40,000
But he killed your family by mistake
while trying to protect you.

438
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,769
Plagued by guilt, he quit the job,

439
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,929
and I was hurriedly sent in.

440
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,739
Are you Jae Hoon?

441
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,050
You poor thing.

442
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:57,849
My nephew.

443
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,550
Who are you?

444
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:02,690
I'm your aunt.
I'm your mom's younger sister.

445
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:06,489
I heard the news late
because I was living in the US.

446
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:08,989
Aunt.

447
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:12,090
It pains me.

448
00:38:14,329 --> 00:38:15,530
Don't you worry.

449
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:19,369
Let's live together from now on, okay?

450
00:38:20,469 --> 00:38:24,309
It was my duty to keep an eye
on everything you did...

451
00:38:24,809 --> 00:38:25,940
and report it.

452
00:38:26,179 --> 00:38:28,579
You pretended to move me
to your family certificate...

453
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,409
then changed my social security number.

454
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:51,030
That's so hilarious.

455
00:38:51,699 --> 00:38:53,900
Are you sleepy?
You should go to bed first.

456
00:38:54,369 --> 00:38:57,070
- Okay. Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

457
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,039
I forced you to move out early
because I was terrified of you.

458
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:34,809
Then I got married and had Hoon Seok.
However...

459
00:39:34,909 --> 00:39:36,079
Buy it for me.

460
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:39,119
Never in my wildest dreams did I think...

461
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,050
- you'd meet my son.
- Who is he?

462
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:43,849
I rushed over to see my mom
because she was very ill.

463
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,420
When I found out
that Hoon Seok was with you,

464
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,889
I was terrified that you'd hurt him.

465
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:51,489
I immediately left home to get him.

466
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:55,300
My son is at Ba Reum's house.

467
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,769
I'm worried he might hurt him.

468
00:39:56,829 --> 00:39:58,869
No. If you go there right now,
you'll ruin everything.

469
00:39:58,969 --> 00:40:02,170
Have you gone crazy?
What if that monster kills my son?

470
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:03,269
I need to go.

471
00:40:03,409 --> 00:40:05,880
Let me go. Let go.

472
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:07,210
Mom.

473
00:40:07,309 --> 00:40:09,949
How could you come here
without telling me?

474
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,250
Don't you know
I've been looking everywhere for you?

475
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:15,179
That day, I quit my job.

476
00:40:16,219 --> 00:40:18,789
They told me to tell you
that I would be sent to the US.

477
00:40:19,989 --> 00:40:21,190
I was pretty much...

478
00:40:22,789 --> 00:40:24,130
Truman.

479
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:30,400
Did they run me over
when I was chasing Sung Yo Han...

480
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:34,070
so that I wouldn't meet him?

481
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:38,070
They later found out that Professor Lee
had spoken with Yo Han.

482
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:41,739
They believed everything would fall
through...

483
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,780
if Yo Han told you the truth.

484
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:45,849
That's why.

485
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:52,489
I had no idea and was after him.

486
00:40:53,059 --> 00:40:54,690
Even if you didn't try to kill him...

487
00:40:55,289 --> 00:40:56,789
or that detective didn't shoot him,

488
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:59,329
Yo Han would've died in their hands.

489
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:02,260
I overheard them reporting
about having arrived late.

490
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:05,869
They said they hurriedly fled the scene
after Yo Han was shot.

491
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:10,440
How could one be so odious?

492
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:13,809
That individual has a strong belief.

493
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:18,349
And there was a time
when I also believed it.

494
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,320
A belief?

495
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:41,869
(Bukyeong-gu)

496
00:41:50,449 --> 00:41:53,980
In the beginning, killers pick out victims
who live near their houses.

497
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:57,920
Then they gradually
go farther and farther.

498
00:41:58,619 --> 00:42:01,659
They even travel great distances
for their victims...

499
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:03,260
because their confidence grows.

500
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:05,559
This was where Ba Reum used to live
back then.

501
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:10,400
After the surgery, he lost his memory.

502
00:42:10,469 --> 00:42:13,639
He forgot the fact
that he was a serial murderer.

503
00:42:14,539 --> 00:42:17,070
But the killer instincts remained.

504
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:19,940
I must say, you've changed a lot.
You keep surprising me.

505
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:23,309
Honestly, before your head injury,

506
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:26,949
you didn't seem to be
cut out for this job.

507
00:42:27,019 --> 00:42:31,989
But now, you act as if you can see
deep inside a murderer's mind.

508
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:34,460
What if Sung Yo Han wasn't
the real killer?

509
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:37,429
If it wasn't him,

510
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:43,199
then I killed an innocent man.

511
00:42:43,329 --> 00:42:45,570
No. That can't be.

512
00:42:46,969 --> 00:42:48,940
Then why did he try to kill Ba Reum?

513
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,570
It was because Ba Reum was a witness.

514
00:42:52,579 --> 00:42:54,639
Why did he go to Ba Reum's?

515
00:42:57,079 --> 00:42:58,179
Where is Han Guk?

516
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:01,320
- Han...
- Yes, Han Guk.

517
00:43:01,550 --> 00:43:02,750
Where is he, punk?

518
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:06,219
He was trying to tell me something.

519
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:08,389
- What?
- Hwa...

520
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:10,190

00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:31,210
I'll call you back later.

529
00:43:34,349 --> 00:43:36,519
Did you confirm Ba Reum's whereabouts
on the day the incidents occurred?

530
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:39,250
Yes, his alibi checked out.
During Kang Deok Soo's incident,

531
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,159
he was home with his cousin.

532
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:42,929
But I'm not sure
about the other incidents.

533
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:45,389
- I bet he was home.
- You bet?

534

Do your job properly.

535

Check all the CCTV near his house
this instant.

Yes, sir.

537
00:44:03,809 --> 00:44:05,449
There's a CCTV here.

538

I'm pretty sure that one
will give me something.

539
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:11,349
No, it's illegal.

540
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:13,519
Right. The presidential election is
just around the corner.

is leading by far.

00:54:22,130 --> 00:54:23,130
Let me see him.

661
00:54:24,869 --> 00:54:26,900
Sang. Sang.

662
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,239
- Hey. Wait.
- Stop it.

663
00:54:30,639 --> 00:54:31,739
- Come with us.
- Stop it.

664
00:54:31,769 --> 00:54:33,780
Sang! Sang...

665
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:36,750
- Get him out of here.
- Sang.

666
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:41,050
- Stop it.
- Who did that? Who?

667
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:43,179
I asked who did it! Who was it?

668
00:54:43,219 --> 00:54:44,690
- Just calm down already.
- Stop it.

669
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:45,949
Who was it?

670
00:54:49,659 --> 00:54:50,659
Hey.

671
00:54:52,989 --> 00:54:57,030
At the murder scene of Corporal Shin,
belongings of Kang Deok Soo, Lee Jae Shik,

672
00:54:57,070 --> 00:54:58,300
- Kang Deok Soo's belonging?
- and Kim Byeong Tae...

673
00:54:58,530 --> 00:55:00,469
- Jung Ba Reum, that scumbag.
- were found.

674
00:55:00,639 --> 00:55:02,599
The police sent the items
to the National Forensic Service.

675
00:55:25,059 --> 00:55:26,960
Neither Inspector Bok nor I couldn't
answer his calls.

676
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:29,460
We were out of the city then.

677
00:55:34,269 --> 00:55:37,239
You found Kang Deok Soo's belonging
around Sang's body, right?

678
00:55:37,269 --> 00:55:38,510
We found Kang Deok Soo's lighter,

679
00:55:38,969 --> 00:55:41,639
Lee Jae Shik's ornamental button,
and Kim Byeong Tae's earring.

680
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:45,449
Jung Ba Reum, that scumbag.

681
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:47,050
I heard that Sang said he had a laptop
for forensics.

682
00:55:47,079 --> 00:55:48,150
But we didn't find it.

683
00:55:48,449 --> 00:55:50,150
Neither at the site
nor in Detective Shin's car.

684
00:55:53,090 --> 00:55:55,190
CCTV. Right, CCTV.

685
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:57,860
Let's check the CCTV. Let's do that.

686
00:55:58,130 --> 00:55:59,230
Let's check the CCTV.

687
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:01,659
Darn. Why won't he pick up?

688
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:04,599
Mr. Go?

689
00:56:04,769 --> 00:56:06,530
It's me, Ba Reum.

690
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:09,670
I got a lot of missed calls from you.

691
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:14,179
Where... Where are you now?

692
00:56:14,909 --> 00:56:17,280
I'm on my way home. Why did you call me...

693
00:56:25,050 --> 00:56:26,150
That was the reason.

694
00:56:26,989 --> 00:56:28,719
He was killed because of that laptop.

695
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,789
Why did Detective Shin have that?

696
00:56:31,030 --> 00:56:33,460
Yesterday, I told Detective Shin
to check...

697
00:56:33,559 --> 00:56:36,000
the CCTV cameras
around Jung Ba Reum's house.

698
00:56:36,659 --> 00:56:38,300
Jung Ba Reum, that scumbag.

699
00:56:38,329 --> 00:56:39,599
It wasn't Officer Jung.

700
00:56:40,539 --> 00:56:44,070
We checked his alibi. He was
on Jeju Island at the time of the crime.

701
00:56:44,239 --> 00:56:45,440
He came back this morning.

702
00:56:45,469 --> 00:56:47,039
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

703
00:56:47,139 --> 00:56:48,409
We confirmed his flight records,

704
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:50,150
and he was caught on CCTV cameras
at the airport.

705
00:56:51,679 --> 00:56:52,750
He's here.

706
00:56:53,849 --> 00:56:56,219
I thought you wouldn't go,
so I asked him to come.

707
00:56:56,349 --> 00:56:57,849
Let's get your hand looked at.

708
00:56:57,949 --> 00:56:59,820
- My hand's the least of our problems.
- Hey.

709
00:56:59,889 --> 00:57:01,960
- Inspector Bok!
- Get it looked at.

710
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:05,730
You can't control your emotions
because you keep taking these.

711
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:07,300
Why do you take these?

712
00:57:07,829 --> 00:57:08,900
What is that?

713
00:58:08,159 --> 00:58:10,829
I found them on the floor
of the Task Force office.

714
00:58:10,889 --> 00:58:11,929
They aren't yours?

715
00:58:14,230 --> 00:58:15,260
This is...

716
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:20,599
A total of 20 minutes.
At least 20 minutes. Over 20 minutes.

717
00:58:21,969 --> 00:58:23,710
Twenty minutes isn't enough.

718
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:26,840
Isn't this for headaches? A painkiller?

719
00:58:27,079 --> 00:58:29,440
That's what the bottle says,

720
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:30,949
but the contents are completely different.

721
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:33,510
That medication suppresses
serotonin secretion.

722
00:58:33,949 --> 00:58:34,849
Serotonin?

723
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:39,019
Serotonin is a brain secretion
that controls one's anger.

724
00:58:39,449 --> 00:58:41,260
If you lack serotonin,

725
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:44,489
you can't control your emotions
and you become aggressive.

726
00:58:45,559 --> 00:58:47,530
Why was Ba Reum taking this?

727
00:58:47,699 --> 00:58:50,530
- You can't go in there.
- I just want to ask a few questions.

728
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:52,429
I'm Go Mu Chi from Mujin Police Station.

729
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:57,570
Thank you.

730
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:03,039
Did you prescribe these?

731
00:59:05,309 --> 00:59:08,420
I prescribed these for Jung Ba Reum.

732
00:59:08,719 --> 00:59:10,250
He often complains of headaches.

733
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:11,849
Did he? That's strange.

734
00:59:12,019 --> 00:59:15,590
I heard these make you lose control
and become aggressive.

735
00:59:16,789 --> 00:59:19,690
That can't be. I prescribed painkillers.

736
00:59:20,130 --> 00:59:22,500
Do you think the patient himself...

737
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:24,070
swapped them out?

738
00:59:24,199 --> 00:59:28,039
Right? A doctor wouldn't
prescribe these to a patient...

739
00:59:28,099 --> 00:59:30,199
who just had brain surgery, right?

740
00:59:31,510 --> 00:59:33,710
Thank you. Have a good day.

741
00:59:43,579 --> 00:59:45,190
I forgot something.

742
00:59:46,219 --> 00:59:47,619
You were making a call.

743
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:50,559
I hung up.

744
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:55,329
By the way, can medication like this
be purchased without a prescription?

745
00:59:55,630 --> 00:59:57,769
I just got a call about a serious patient.

746
00:59:57,900 --> 00:59:58,969
Let's talk later.

747
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:29,699
Hello?

748
01:00:30,769 --> 01:00:33,099
No. I didn't make a call.

749
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:37,369
What?

750
01:00:38,039 --> 01:00:40,309
Did a detective come by?

751
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:44,750
I'm a detective. Tell me something.

752
01:00:45,449 --> 01:00:48,349
The pills inside are not
what the bottle says they are.

753
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:49,650
Who prescribed these?

754
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:51,250
It's Jung Ba Reum's.

755
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:53,789
These weren't given out
because they were prescribed.

756
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:55,920
The hospital director
brought them here himself.

757
01:00:56,260 --> 01:00:57,889
We just handed it to him.

758
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:02,900
Thank you.

759
01:01:09,639 --> 01:01:13,010
I'll send you a phone number.
Tell me which cell tower it pings from.

760
01:01:13,369 --> 01:01:16,579
It's a burner phone
and three cell towers show up.

761
01:01:17,179 --> 01:01:18,280
Three?

762
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:20,380
Which ones?

763
01:01:49,139 --> 01:01:50,309
(Warning, Cheongwadaero 1,
Sejong-ro, Jongno-gu)

764
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:18,739
Keep tracing the number for me.

765
01:02:59,309 --> 01:03:01,519
How did you find this place?

766
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:09,820
Not long ago, Daniel Lee
asked me to kill someone.

767
01:03:13,829 --> 01:03:15,000
The next target.

768
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:18,500
Consider it an apex predator.

769
01:03:19,329 --> 01:03:22,070
This was the address he gave me.
