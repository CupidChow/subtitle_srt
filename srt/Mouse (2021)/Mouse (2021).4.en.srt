11

Officer Jung's number is...

speed dial one.

(Mouse)

14
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:05,560
Sometimes, I go on an impromptu hunt.

15
00:02:07,329 --> 00:02:10,469
This unfortunate old woman
saw something she shouldn't have,

16
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:14,069
and just had to become my prey.

17
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,979
Until the moment they die,

18
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:20,039
prey must put up a desperate fight.

19
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,449
But this prey seems to lack...

20
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,319
any strength at all to fight.

21
00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:29,590
So this hunt was insignificant...

22
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:30,919
and boring.

23
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:34,030
One day, you will...

24
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,229

(My Bong Yi)

26
00:03:05,689 --> 00:03:07,460
Did they find anything?

27
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:09,860
Not yet.

28
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,569
Sung Yo Han says
this friend will testify...

29
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:16,729
he was at home the day
Professor Lee disappeared.

30
00:03:16,969 --> 00:03:18,740
- Meet him.
- Okay.

31
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:20,569
There's something about Sung Yo Han.

32
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,370
Kim Joon Sung?

33
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,639
Did you find anything?

34
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,139
No. It's clean.

35
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,009
Darn it.

36
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,810
We should've found it before it rained.

37
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,719
What about the finger from the wine?

38
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,080
It's Na Chi Gook's.

39
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,819
Then who does the other finger belong to?

40
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:36,449
Yes, sir.

41
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,960
Really? I'll come right over.

42
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,830
- What is it?
- I think we found the finger's owner.

43
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:46,969
Thanks a lot. Did you drive?

44
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:48,370
- Yes.
- Follow me.

45
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:08,150
This was a clothing factory
run by a religious organization...

46
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:09,520
until two years ago.

47
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:16,959
Why are you here?

48
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:19,730
What happened?

49
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:22,069
He's been dead for about 10 days.

50
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,899
He missed work for that long
and no one asked about him.

51
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:28,370
The world has gotten so cold.

52
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:31,310
There's something in his throat.

53
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,720
What is that?

54
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:40,920
I don't know. Decay is too advanced.

55
00:04:42,089 --> 00:04:44,490
Report of a murder. Report of a murder.

56

(I saw the girl's killer who was
on the news. What should I do?)

57
00:05:04,509 --> 00:05:08,009
Okay. Give me a call
as soon as Officer Jung wakes up.

58
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:11,220
I hope it's not too serious.

59
00:05:15,689 --> 00:05:16,689
What's wrong?

60
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,120
There's a schoolgirl.

61
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:24,060
Are you sick? Why are you there?

62
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,529
Can you give me a ride
just across the bridge?

63
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,000
Get in the car.

64
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:37,240
My gosh. You'll catch a cold.

65
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:51,660
Thank you.

66
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:56,660
I bought this car just last week.

67

You can never let leather seats get wet.

68
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,970
Hey. What's wrong with you?

69
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:04,939
Why were you out there in the rain?

70
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:07,470
My grandma didn't pick up.

71
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,040
So you stayed out there
in this dreadful rain?

72
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:12,709
You're not a kid.

73
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:26,120
- Please let me out here.
- Here?

74
00:06:28,829 --> 00:06:32,129
Wait a minute.
I have an umbrella in the trunk.

75
00:06:35,769 --> 00:06:36,870
Right.

76
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,699
Thank you.

77
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,240
Take this.

78
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,339
Make sure to keep an eye out.

79
00:06:46,579 --> 00:06:47,750
Go straight on home.

80
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,319
So she lives in this neighborhood.

81
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:57,019
Is she someone you know?

82
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,889
No, just go.

83
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:03,930
That umbrella is sold out everywhere.

84
00:07:04,029 --> 00:07:06,160
I should've asked for it back
when she was done.

85
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,300
I heard your parents conceived you
after trying for ten years.

86
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:12,300
I'm sure they were happy then,
not knowing you'd be this immature.

87
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,240
Anyway, who's the victim now?

88
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:21,350
Why isn't she picking up?

89
00:07:23,149 --> 00:07:24,420
Is she that angry with me?

90
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,430
Oh, hello.

91
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,160
Is there something going on
in our neighborhood?

92
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:40,829
We don't know either.
We just heard the sirens.

93
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,430
If there are that many police cars out,

94
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,240
I bet it's a murder.

95
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:48,339
After watching scary things all day
instead of studying, listen to him.

96
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:51,180
Are you really going to treat
the future Hitchcock like that?

97
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:54,310
I'm going to investigate
the fresh murder scene.

98
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:55,480
I'll see you at home.

99
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:56,480
Bye, Bong Yi.

100
00:07:56,509 --> 00:08:00,250
I can't believe I made him
delicious seaweed soup, for that.

101
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:03,350
Wait a minute.
Have you seen my grandmother?

102
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:04,660
I haven't.

103
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:08,389
Now that I think about it,
she's not out here.

104
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,930
Oh, she must've gone there.

105
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:14,899
You know she'll call my mosquito
incense a fire and come watch.

106
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,740
I'll try heading there.

107
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:19,339
You go ahead.

108
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,049
What a scumbag.

109
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,490
Now he's even gone after an elderly woman.

(Forensic Service)

111
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,320
There are signs that her hand was burned.

112
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:08,149
I think she put out the fire
with her hand.

113
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:15,230
Why did she hold onto this
so fiercely till the end?

114
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:19,929
My poor baby.

115
00:09:20,029 --> 00:09:21,870
It'll be all right, grandmother.

116
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:27,440
Mister, please tell them to take me.

117
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,779
They can take me instead
of my darling little one.

118
00:09:49,659 --> 00:09:51,029
Why did you follow me here?

119
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,759
This is awful.

120
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:56,299
What? What did you say?
Are you talking to me?

121
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,039
Are you calling me...

122
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,840
What's wrong?

123
00:10:00,539 --> 00:10:02,440
Is it someone you know?

124
00:10:04,509 --> 00:10:07,809
Why is it always the pitiful ones
who have to die?

125
00:10:14,419 --> 00:10:15,850
What a crazy fool.

126
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,519

168
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,759
That's how we'll catch that scum. Got it?

169
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,490
So...

170
00:13:12,529 --> 00:13:16,029
while the detectives and I
were down at the main station,

171
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:19,299
the grandmother kept calling me.

172
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:23,340
I didn't even know
until I got to the substation.

173
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:25,340
(You have 7 missed calls from
010-230-0627.)

174
00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:27,879
The person you have reached
is not available. Please leave...

175
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:33,179
I saw the murderer who was on the news.

176
00:13:33,649 --> 00:13:34,919
What should I do?

177
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,019
(You have a voicemail from 010-230-0627.)

178
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:37,620
You are being connected.

179
00:13:37,659 --> 00:13:39,919
Why aren't you picking up your phone?

180
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,659
My goodness.

181
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,159
I can't do a thing myself
because I'm too terrified.

182
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:49,000
Please come meet me at the General Store.

183
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,970
- I have a photo.
- Grandmother?

184
00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:53,639
- The general store was closed.
- Ma'am?

185
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,809
I called her back right away.

186
00:13:57,509 --> 00:14:00,110
The area's being redeveloped,
so it was deserted.

187
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:01,309
Grandmother?

188
00:14:02,149 --> 00:14:05,080
But I heard her cell phone ring
somewhere around there.

189
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,720
I thought it was strange.

190
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:10,549
Grandmother, are you here?

191
00:14:13,289 --> 00:14:15,990
Grandmother!

192
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:19,600
What about his face? Did you see his face?

193
00:14:19,629 --> 00:14:22,600
Who's there?

194
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:24,639
It was too dark, and he fled
so quickly, that I...

195
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:30,409
Is there anything else? Think.
You need to give us a lead.

196
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,179
- He was left-handed.
- Left-handed?

197
00:14:37,379 --> 00:14:39,450
I'm sure of it.

198
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,289
You said that perpetrator
was also left-handed.

199
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,490
The criminal is left-handed.

200
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:46,990
The knife is inserted at 1pm
on a clock face.

201
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:49,429
That's an angle made possible
by a left-handed stab.

202
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,889
I'm sure he's left-handed.

203
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:37,909
Anything else?

204
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:40,279
Is there anything else?

205
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:45,720
When I tussled with him,
I smelled something.

206
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,220
You smelled something?

207
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,350
What smell?

208
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:53,059
It smelled like mint.

209
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:08,370
Why are you here all of a sudden,
without getting in touch first?

210
00:16:08,809 --> 00:16:12,009
I went to a flower exhibit
and stopped by on my way home.

211
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:14,950
The housekeeper must be very meticulous.

212
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:17,009
The house seems so clean.

213
00:16:17,149 --> 00:16:20,120
Stop sending housekeepers. I'm
uncomfortable having a stranger in here.

214
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:22,190
You haven't eaten dinner yet, right?

215
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,620
Make sure you eat regular meals.

216
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:36,429
I put your clothes in the washer.

217
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,240
I guess you had an emergency patient
while leaving the hospital.

218
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:42,870
I don't understand why you chose
to be an ER doctor...

219
00:16:43,409 --> 00:16:46,940
out of all types of doctors. You always
get your clothes covered with blood.

220
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:53,779
I like the scent.

221
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:57,250
You never use any product with scent.

222
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:06,660
You must be dating someone now.

223
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:13,140
Are you considering marrying her too?

224
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:18,079
Great. I want to see a grandchild soon.

225
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:19,509
I'll help you raise your child.

226
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:21,509
The thought of it alone terrifies me.

227
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:24,049
What?

228
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,690
Imagine a grandchild of Han Seo Joon.

229
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:32,690
Yo Han.

230
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:41,869
Did you see that lady before that today?

231
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:45,099
Did she say or do anything unusual?

232
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,769
She had a quarrel with her granddaughter,

233
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:51,109
and got upset. That's all.

234
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,839
Didn't she say she would go anywhere?

235
00:17:54,109 --> 00:17:55,809
I think she said she would go home.

236
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,779
You think? Focus and try to remember
what she said!

237
00:17:59,049 --> 00:18:00,480
Don't answer me halfheartedly!

238
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,849
Why are you yelling at him when he's hurt?

239
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:08,430
- I was asking regarding an investigation.
- Hello, sir.

240
00:18:08,829 --> 00:18:11,160
I was told to move him to
a single room for witness protection.

241
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,930
Take care of yourself.
I'll come back later.

242
00:18:19,539 --> 00:18:21,410
Earlier at around 8pm,

243
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:24,210
a woman in her 70s was found
stabbed to death...

244
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:27,140
in an empty house in Gudong Village,
which is a redevelopment area.

245
00:18:27,579 --> 00:18:28,910
The police presume...

246
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:31,849
that it was committed by the serial killer
of the recent murders.

247
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,849
Also, another victim who is believed
to be killed by the same serial killer...

248
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,390
was found at a closed factory that was
run by a religious group...

249
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:40,190
10 days after the death.

250
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:43,930
The total number of the victims of
the serial murder case is now six.

251
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,329
You need to die.

252
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:47,930
You're a monster.

253
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:51,500
I shouldn't have had you.

254
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:54,609
I shouldn't have given birth to you.

255
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:10,049
How should I pay for all my sins?

256
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,069
The police officer who was hit by a car
while chasing the killer...

257
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:26,299
is being treated at a hospital now.

258
00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:39,119
I'm sorry, Auntie and Uncle.

259
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:45,420
I knew you weren't cut out for
being a police officer.

260
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,960
Honey, I'll stay with him tonight.

261
00:19:49,329 --> 00:19:50,990
Sure. Stay here with him.

262
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:53,930
That's okay. Dong Goo will come
and stay with me tonight.

263
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:57,269
I'm fine. You should go home now.

264
00:19:57,769 --> 00:20:00,269
All right then. I'll come back
tomorrow morning.

265
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:43,710
What should I make today?

266
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:16,180
Did he get hurt? He would never put on
a bandage with a cartoon character on it.

267
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:32,460
(No visitors allowed,
Thank you for your cooperation.)

268
00:22:07,099 --> 00:22:09,299
- You're not allowed in there.
- Move.

269
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:10,970
- I said, you can't go in there!
- Move!

270
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,069
- Hey!
- Ouch! Let go of me!

271
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:15,170
- Let go of me!
- Hey, let him go now.

272
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,140
You idiot, how can you call yourself
a police officer?

273
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:22,150
- Gosh, kid. Get out right now.
- Hands off.

274
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:24,410
Why... Why...

275
00:22:24,579 --> 00:22:26,779
Why didn't you answer
my grandma's calls? Why?

276
00:22:27,019 --> 00:22:28,950
Why didn't you pick up? Answer me.

277
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,890
She died because of you.

278
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:34,089
It's all your fault... Let go of me.

279
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,990
You must find that scum.

280
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,759
Find the scum...

281
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:40,400
who killed my grandma, you jerk.

282
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:48,109
Bring my grandma back to life.
Please, I'm begging you.

283
00:22:48,609 --> 00:22:49,710
Please.

284
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,910
My grandma...

285
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,779
Bring my grandma back to life.

286
00:22:56,049 --> 00:22:58,549
My grandma... My grandma...

287
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:07,920
My grandma...

288
00:23:16,769 --> 00:23:19,099
The nightmare of the Headhunter...

289
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:21,809
that drove the nation into fear
25 years ago has resurfaced.

290
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:25,180
In the past 2 months,
there have been 6 murders,

291
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,779
but the police haven't been able to
even get a hint on the killer,

292
00:23:28,849 --> 00:23:31,410
the fear and distrust of people
have gone to an extreme.

293
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,250
I've seen this somewhere.

294
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:40,460
On my way to church,
I saw a sudden flash of light.

295
00:23:41,059 --> 00:23:43,990
"A flash of light"? Like a camera flash?

296
00:23:54,569 --> 00:23:57,309
(Picture 2)

297
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:01,279
What a perverse psycho.

298
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:04,079
He kills people and takes photos?

299
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:08,589
Then where did that lady find this photo?

300
00:24:09,049 --> 00:24:10,549
What do you mean
there are no security cameras?

301
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,259
Since it's an old village
that will be redeveloped,

302
00:24:13,289 --> 00:24:16,630
only a few households are
still living there.

303
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:20,000
Then check the dashcam footage of the cars
parked in the neighborhood yesterday.

304
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:21,430
Find all the footage with the lady.

305
00:24:21,529 --> 00:24:24,730
There's no one who has a car
among the remaining residents.

306
00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:28,309
It's a dying village. We rarely see cars
from outside the village.

307
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:31,980
Oh, there. That's her. This lady.

308
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,380
Where did she get on the bus?

309
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,309
Hey, it's me.

310
00:24:35,579 --> 00:24:38,619
Check all the security footage in subways
and buses near Gudong Station.

311
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,819
Find the footage with the lady.

312
00:24:40,619 --> 00:24:41,990
There must be some.

313
00:24:46,859 --> 00:24:47,990
But it's too bright.

314
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:49,259
Hey, Officer Jung!

315
00:24:50,329 --> 00:24:51,390
Detective Go.

316
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:53,000
What are you doing here?

317
00:24:53,059 --> 00:24:54,500
I'm trying to find the killer.

318
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,700
Did you visit the bus company too?

319
00:24:57,769 --> 00:25:00,099
You're not well. Go home now.

320
00:25:00,369 --> 00:25:01,670
I must find him.

321
00:25:02,009 --> 00:25:04,640
He might've been caught on that camera.
I'll go and check it.

322
00:25:05,309 --> 00:25:06,980
Hey, hey! Officer Jung!

323
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:21,460
(Motel)

324
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,329
Where on earth did she go?

325
00:25:27,529 --> 00:25:30,269
(Mechanics)

326
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:33,769
I know the buildings are old,
but how are there no cameras at all?

327
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:36,740
I'll keep looking.
You go back to the hospital.

328
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:38,640
She died because of me.

329
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,839
I must catch her killer.

330
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,319
Hello, I'm with the police.

331
00:25:48,349 --> 00:25:49,589
Are there any cameras...

332
00:25:49,819 --> 00:25:50,990
Then did you...

333
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:52,859
I've never seen her.

334
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:57,390
Excuse me. I'm a policeman.

335
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:59,299
I don't know her.

336
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:03,069
Hello.

337
00:26:08,309 --> 00:26:09,470
I'm with the police.

338
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:11,140
I don't know her.

339
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:18,109
(Land of Helpers)

340
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:19,750
Welcome. Hello.

341
00:26:19,779 --> 00:26:21,990
Hi. I'm with the police.

342
00:26:22,619 --> 00:26:23,589
I see.

343
00:26:23,619 --> 00:26:27,190
Yesterday afternoon,
did this old lady come here?

344
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,829
What's the matter?

345
00:26:30,859 --> 00:26:33,599
Do you know someone
was murdered nearby last night?

346
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,700
Yes.

347
00:26:35,099 --> 00:26:38,299
Oh, dear. Is this old lady the dead woman?

348
00:26:38,339 --> 00:26:41,839
We checked cameras in the area
and she entered an alley close by.

349
00:26:43,309 --> 00:26:44,609
She wasn't here.

350
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:48,279
If anyone comes here...

351
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:51,920
and they recognize her,
please have them call the police.

352
00:26:55,289 --> 00:26:56,819
I know.

353
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,420
I can't report her for stealing
a few yogurt drinks.

354
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,789
Excuse me.

355
00:27:06,099 --> 00:27:07,230
Who just came by?

356
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:09,670
The news said someone was murdered nearby.

357
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:12,039
They came to ask if the old lady was here.

358
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,839
Really?

359
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:15,869
Oh.

360
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:19,279
Wait. This old lady...

361
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:22,450
- Is this her?
- Yes. Why?

362
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:26,119
It's the woman who took our yogurt drinks.

363
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:29,519
- I should call it in. My gosh.
- Are you crazy?

364
00:27:29,549 --> 00:27:33,089
What if they find out
we hire illegal immigrants?

365
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:36,559
Darn it. Just don't do anything.

366
00:27:37,059 --> 00:27:38,900
Don't cause any trouble.

367
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:41,829
- But someone died.
- Be quiet.

368
00:27:42,069 --> 00:27:43,569
Do you want to lose our business?

369
00:27:46,339 --> 00:27:47,940
Okay, fine.

370
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:53,210
Get in. I'll take you to the hospital.

371
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,549
What?

372
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:04,819
It's nothing.

373
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:06,460
It's dirty, isn't it?

374
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,859
Get in somehow.

375
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:10,029
Okay.

376
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:33,079
Your leg's not healed yet...

377
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:34,279
and you're helping out.

378
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:36,650
Thank you so much for coming by.

379
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:40,259
My gosh. She wanted her granddaughter
to marry him so badly,

380
00:28:40,289 --> 00:28:42,390
- and he's acting the part.
- Thank you.

381
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:45,799
He took care of every single detail
of the funeral.

382
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,799
When he can barely walk himself.

383
00:28:48,569 --> 00:28:51,329
I feel so sorry for Bong Yi.

384
00:28:51,369 --> 00:28:53,170
I don't think she has any other relatives.

385
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:17,690
We searched all the alleys,

386
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:19,559
but we could've missed something.

387
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:21,759
Team One, search the offices
in this building.

388
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:24,230
Team Two, knock on every door
in the alleys connected to this one.

389
00:29:24,269 --> 00:29:27,240
Team Three, knock on doors across
the main road at the end of this alley.

390
00:29:27,269 --> 00:29:28,769
- That's all.
- Yes, sir!

391
00:29:36,109 --> 00:29:37,150
(Keeping People Safe)

392
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,849
Can I look at the bottom screen?

393
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:42,150
Sure.

394
00:29:49,089 --> 00:29:51,759
I heard that you got Grandma buried.

395
00:29:54,529 --> 00:29:56,069
You could've cremated her.

396
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:57,900
This must've been expensive.

397
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,000
My parents.

398
00:30:02,069 --> 00:30:03,910
I threw their ashes in the sea.

399
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:08,339
So I have nowhere to go
when I feel like crying.

400
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:12,150
Were you afraid...

401
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:15,490
I'd have nowhere to go...

402
00:30:16,019 --> 00:30:17,690
when I miss Grandma?

403
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:35,410
She doesn't drink alcohol.

404
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:42,980
No.

405
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:47,150
My grandma...

406
00:30:48,019 --> 00:30:49,920
used to love makgeolli.

407
00:31:08,539 --> 00:31:09,640
The last thing...

408
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:14,180
I said...

409
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:18,950
to Grandma...

410
00:31:21,619 --> 00:31:24,089
It was something...

411
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,930
I should never have said.

412
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:34,430
I ended up in a mess like this
because I listened to you.

413
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:37,130
What... What did you just say?

414
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:39,339
If I hadn't been a good girl,

415
00:31:39,369 --> 00:31:41,470
I wouldn't have gone to
buy makgeolli for you.

416
00:31:41,569 --> 00:31:42,940
Then it wouldn't have happened...

417
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,509
Grandma.

418
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:55,720
I think I'll go crazy
whenever I think of that.

419
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:01,660
Grandma.

420
00:32:05,299 --> 00:32:09,769
Grandma. I'm... I'm so sorry.

421
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:13,099
I'm really sorry.

422
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:15,240
I'm sorry.

423
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,680
I'm sorry, Grandma.

424
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:27,950
I'm...

425
00:32:28,849 --> 00:32:30,690
I'm sorry.

426
00:33:09,259 --> 00:33:10,359
Don't worry.

427
00:33:11,029 --> 00:33:12,460
I had Dong Goo...

428
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,460
feed it every day.

429
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,420
Get some sleep.

430
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:38,049
Don't think of anything.

431
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:45,900
Go and sleep.

432
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,809
Are you pleased you stuffed your face?

433
00:33:56,839 --> 00:33:58,170
Don't you think I like meat too?

434
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,539
What shall I make for dinner?

435
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:01,279
- I won't eat dinner.
- You should eat dinner.

436
00:34:01,309 --> 00:34:02,880
Tell me what you're craving.

437
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:04,549
What do you want to eat for dinner?
Oh, right.

438
00:34:05,049 --> 00:34:07,680
- How about some boiled meat?
- I don't want to eat anything.

439
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,159
No, Bong Yi. It went bad.

440
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:16,289
- What are you doing?
- Let go of me.

441
00:34:16,329 --> 00:34:18,690
Bong Yi, don't. It's gone bad!

442
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:20,230
What are you doing? Bong Yi.

443
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,360
Stop it.

444
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,329
Don't. Don't eat it. Stop.

445
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,539
Let go.

446
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:49,760
Oh, dear.

447
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:58,130
What should I do about you?

448
00:34:58,670 --> 00:34:59,969
What should I do?

449
00:35:00,699 --> 00:35:03,070
I feel so sorry for you.

450
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:05,880
Grandma.

451
00:35:10,309 --> 00:35:11,510
Grandma.

452
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,489
My grandma.

453
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:24,190
Grandma.

454
00:36:09,739 --> 00:36:11,010
Grandma,

455
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:13,579
don't worry.

456
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:18,210
I have someone watching over me.

457
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:25,789
Why didn't you call me?

458
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,690
Yes.

459
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,590
Did you find anything out?

460
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:33,929
- Not yet.
- I even provided investigative support.

461
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:35,300
What was that?

462
00:36:36,099 --> 00:36:38,769
Did you provide
investigative support for him?

463
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:40,199
Stop bothering me.

464
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:42,510
Did you look into the licenses
from the detention center?

465
00:36:43,369 --> 00:36:46,980
Yes, I looked into everyone there
and all outside visitors,

466
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:49,250
- but no one suspicious came up.
- Are you sure?

467
00:36:49,309 --> 00:36:50,650
Did you double-check everyone?

468
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,150
You didn't miss anyone?

469
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,280
If you can't trust me,
double-check it yourself.

470
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:58,519
I just asked if anyone was missing?

471
00:37:00,059 --> 00:37:02,090
Why is he being so testy lately?

472
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,489
In the past, he used to be
such a brown noser.

473
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:08,300
Yes?

474
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:12,269
What, the CCTV? Did it get the lady?

475
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:15,239
Send it to me.

476
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:17,940
Did we get a clue?

477
00:37:19,579 --> 00:37:21,110
(CCTV: Getting on the bus;
CCTV: Getting off the bus)

478
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,630
I'm with the police.
Have you seen this person before?

479
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:38,230
No, I haven't.

480
00:37:52,409 --> 00:37:54,510
Excuse me, I'm with the police.

481
00:37:54,809 --> 00:37:56,050
Have you seen this granny before?

482
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:57,349
Where does she live?

483
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:05,920
Yo Han, the police are here.
What should I do?

484
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:07,920
Just say what I tell you to.

485
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:11,260
You're Kim Joon Sung, right?

486
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:14,099
I'll just ask you a few questions.

487
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:17,329
- Do you know Sung Yo Han?
- Yes, we're friends.

488
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:21,670
Where were you last Sunday,
from evening till the next morning?

489
00:38:22,469 --> 00:38:24,739
Last Sunday night,

490
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:29,610
Yo Han was very ill,
so I went to his house.

491
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,309
Mr. Sung Yo Han was ill.

492
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,289
Where is my cell phone?

493
00:38:36,449 --> 00:38:38,849
I guess I left it in the car again.

494
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:42,190
I'm so sorry, but could I borrow
yours for one phone call?

495
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:43,530
Sure.

496
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,860
Thank you.

497
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:48,429
This is the new model.

498
00:38:48,829 --> 00:38:51,800
I heard the specs on this are great.

499
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:55,639
(Call log: Yo Han)

500
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:00,639
(Calling Yo Han)

501
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:06,880
Is he gone?
You told them what I said, right?

502
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:16,530
He's not picking up.

503
00:39:16,929 --> 00:39:20,760
Maybe because this is a new model,
but the sound clarity is awesome.

504
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:24,969
I'll contact you right away
if I have more questions.

505
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,079
Yes, Yo Han?

506
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:40,050
No, I didn't call you.

507
00:39:43,449 --> 00:39:45,590
Detective Go, I think you were right.

508
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:47,659
Sung Yo Han's fishy. What should I do?

509
00:39:47,789 --> 00:39:51,230
You know what to do.
Get into his car and get dashcam footage.

510
00:39:51,329 --> 00:39:52,530
Figure out where he's been.

511
00:39:53,329 --> 00:39:54,929
That's illegal.

512
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:57,869
If something happens, it'll be over
for my dad's political career.

513
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,639
He's planning to run for
President next year.

514
00:40:00,969 --> 00:40:04,769
In that case, you shouldn't be
consulting with me.

515
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,579
I'm going to hang up since I'm busy
running an illegal investigation.

516
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:11,780
Hi, I'm with the police.

517
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:13,880
Have you seen this grandmother
around here before?

518
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:15,789
I'm with the police.

519
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:18,750
Have you seen this granny before?

520
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,559
- Are you with the police?
- Yes.

521
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:23,389
- Have you seen this person?
- This one?

522
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:40,840
- What is it?
- Where are you? Get here, now.

523
00:40:40,909 --> 00:40:43,010
- I'm busy.
- I'm telling you to come in, now.

524
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,980
My gosh.

525
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:11,210
I need to eat something.
Why is he yelling at me when...

526
00:41:11,269 --> 00:41:12,610
I'm skipping meals to investigate cases?

527
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,889
What? Why me?

528
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:27,360
Because the murderer scum
has left that message for you,

529
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:28,989
everyone's looking to you now.

530
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:31,329
The whole nation is looking to you.

531
00:41:40,269 --> 00:41:42,539
I thought I was fired.

532
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:43,969
I'm on standby right now.

533
00:41:44,039 --> 00:41:46,780
The Senior Inspector should reveal
the results of the case, not me.

534
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,110
I didn't think you were this stingy.
I'm so disappointed.

535
00:41:48,179 --> 00:41:50,079
I got my orders from above.
What can I do about it?

536
00:41:50,909 --> 00:41:52,519
Or do you want to get fired
for violence while on duty?

537
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:56,789
Why did you have to chatter on
about a serial killer on TV,

538
00:41:56,849 --> 00:42:00,059
becoming his target yourself?

539
00:42:01,489 --> 00:42:03,659
You have plenty of time until 8pm,

540
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:05,929
so organize the case files here
until then.

541
00:42:06,099 --> 00:42:07,329
Don't sneak off somewhere.

542
00:42:07,429 --> 00:42:10,230
- I haven't even eaten yet.
- I'll order you some food.

543
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:16,409
Go, Han Guk.

544
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:26,579
Mrs. Kim,

545
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:28,920
let's take a break,
then go on one more ride.

546
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:41,130
- Mom.
- What is it?

547
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:44,469
Can you buy me some of the Goatman bread?

548
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,000
I'm hungry.

549
00:42:47,269 --> 00:42:51,039
Just be a little more patient.
The broadcasting people said...

550
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,510
they'd buy us dinner later.

551
00:42:57,909 --> 00:43:00,250
Mrs. Kim, could you come
over here for a moment?

552
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,420
All right.

553
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:06,320
Stay right here. I'll be right back.

554
00:43:39,489 --> 00:43:43,059
Today, at 3pm, Kim Han Guk,
who was on "Hope for Children,"

555
00:43:43,159 --> 00:43:45,929
warming the hearts of everyone
in the entire nation,

556
00:43:46,059 --> 00:43:48,929
went missing during a shoot
at an amusement park.

557
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:07,079
Go Mu Chi, come here.

558
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:10,920
Come here, Mu Chi.

559
00:44:11,989 --> 00:44:15,420
All you have to do is read this.

560
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:17,489
The impression you leave
will be important.

561
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:20,860
No matter what the reporters say,
don't lose your temper. Okay?

562
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:23,800
Look at your hair. You slept a lot.

563
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:27,769
Don't make any mistakes.
This is live. Got it?

564
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:30,940
- Do you understand?
- Yes, I do.

565
00:44:31,639 --> 00:44:32,710
I'm hungry.

566
00:44:33,179 --> 00:44:34,780
Go ahead, lie back down.

567
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:01,039
Thankfully, at the scene
of the last victim's murder,

568
00:45:01,739 --> 00:45:04,340
in Gudong, where a woman
in her 70s was killed,

569
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:08,480
we have eyewitness testimony
and CCTV footage,

570
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:10,349
which are aiding in our investigation.

571
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:15,050
Based on the items
that belonged to the victims...

572
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:17,150
found at the greenhouse murder scene,

573
00:45:17,389 --> 00:45:20,619
we ruled the previously
mentioned cases as serial murder,

574
00:45:20,659 --> 00:45:21,920
and we're carrying out an investigation.

575
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:25,090
Considering the seriousness of the case,

576
00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:27,800
we're investigating in all directions...

577
00:45:27,829 --> 00:45:30,769
trying to figure out the motive,
the relationship with the victims,

578
00:45:30,969 --> 00:45:34,239
whether there's an accomplice
or someone who abetted the crime.

579
00:45:34,269 --> 00:45:37,610
Please understand that we can not reveal
any more information.

580
00:45:37,639 --> 00:45:40,380
Also, we won't take any questions...

581
00:45:40,409 --> 00:45:41,639
today.

582
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:43,579
We promise we'll do our best...

583
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:46,280
to catch the culprit as soon as possible
for the safety of the people.

584
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:47,380
That's all. Thank you.

585
00:45:47,519 --> 00:45:49,949
There have been 6 innocent victims
in the past 2 months.

586
00:45:49,989 --> 00:45:52,250
Did you make any progress
in the investigation?

587
00:45:52,289 --> 00:45:53,860
Didn't you just sit back and do nothing?

588
00:45:55,289 --> 00:45:58,760
Please understand that I can't answer that
as the investigation is ongoing.

589
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:01,599
I heard that the killer left a message
for you at the murder scene...

590
00:46:01,630 --> 00:46:03,530
of the college student.

591
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:05,730
Why did the killer leave that message
to a particular detective?

592
00:46:05,769 --> 00:46:07,300
You should ask that scum yourself.

593
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:08,670
I'm as curious as you are now.

594
00:46:08,739 --> 00:46:10,840
You said the victims were chosen
randomly by a psychopath.

595
00:46:10,909 --> 00:46:12,369
Do you still believe that?

596
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:16,409
You said there are six victims
of the serial murder.

597
00:46:16,449 --> 00:46:17,550
Aren't there seven victims?

598
00:46:17,579 --> 00:46:20,719
We got a tip-off that the same person
attempted to kill a prison officer too.

599
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:23,719
- For confidentiality reasons...
- The killer sneaked in there...

600
00:46:23,789 --> 00:46:26,519
to kill a prison officer. Can you say
the victims were randomly chosen?

601
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:29,090
Are you sure that there's no link
between the victims?

602
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:31,929
Could you be investigating the case
in the wrong direction?

603
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:34,260
We investigated thoroughly.

604
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:37,570
I can assure you
that there's no link between the victims.

605
00:46:46,210 --> 00:46:48,010
No link between the victims. But...

606
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:49,550
But what?

607
00:46:49,579 --> 00:46:52,210
If the killer has his own criteria
for choosing victims...

608
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:02,059
(Bingo!)

609
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,130
(Bingo!)

610
00:47:07,429 --> 00:47:08,860
(Blocked)

611
00:47:14,570 --> 00:47:15,639
Who are you?

612
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,269
Detective Go, you never let me down.

613
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:22,010
You were wrong about one thing,
but all in all, you did a great job.

614
00:47:22,679 --> 00:47:23,750
What?

615
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,179
- Are you saying...
- That's right.

616
00:47:26,219 --> 00:47:28,250
I have my own victim selection criteria.

617
00:47:28,349 --> 00:47:30,989
Then why did I choose that kid?

618
00:47:31,019 --> 00:47:33,059
- What?
- Why will that kid have to die?

619
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:35,360
- What did the kid do wrong?
- You little...

620
00:47:35,389 --> 00:47:37,389
Detective Go, you like
to be on a TV show, right?

621
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:40,300
What was the show where you blabbered
that I chose the victims randomly?

622
00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:43,699
Find out the reason why I chose
the kid on that show.

623
00:47:44,869 --> 00:47:46,699
Make sure you're sober.

624
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,000
Take this seriously.

625
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:50,039
A person's life is on the line.

626
00:47:50,210 --> 00:47:51,769
What did you say, you psycho?

627
00:47:51,969 --> 00:47:55,340
If you don't say the correct answer,
I will kill the kid...

628
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:58,010
when the show ends
in front of all people in the country.

629
00:47:58,809 --> 00:48:00,119
- I promise.
- Hey...

630
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:05,489
- Who was that?
- Whom did you call a psycho?

631
00:48:05,519 --> 00:48:07,389
- Whom did you just speak to?
- A statement please!

632
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:08,860
- Who was that?
- Was it the killer?

633
00:48:08,889 --> 00:48:10,760
- Tell us who it was!
- Did you speak to the killer?

634
00:48:10,929 --> 00:48:13,760
That's right. I have my own
victim selection criteria.

635
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:16,829
Then why did I choose that kid?

636
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:18,630
Why will that kid have to die?

637
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:20,000
What did the kid do wrong?

638
00:48:21,269 --> 00:48:23,539
Who on earth is he planning to kill?

639
00:48:26,909 --> 00:48:29,079
My gosh. What is going on?

640
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:30,650
On top of the serial murder,

641
00:48:30,679 --> 00:48:32,579
now the kidnapping? Gosh.

642
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:35,420
He came to Korea to find his father.

643
00:48:35,449 --> 00:48:39,019
As his story was revealed,
many people stepped up to help him out.

644
00:48:39,619 --> 00:48:42,719
No clues were found at the site.

645
00:48:42,889 --> 00:48:44,460
- The police...
- Could he be...

646
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:47,300
Then why did I choose that kid?

647
00:48:47,630 --> 00:48:49,059
Why will that kid have to die?

648
00:48:49,099 --> 00:48:50,500
What did the kid do wrong?

649
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:53,800
The kidnapper called Han Guk's mother...

650
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:55,340
and demanded money for his life.

651
00:48:55,940 --> 00:49:00,139
This is a typical kidnapping case
done for money.

652
00:49:04,579 --> 00:49:06,579
Wait. Did you call it
"money for his life"?

653
00:49:07,949 --> 00:49:09,650
Don't people call it a ransom?

654
00:49:09,789 --> 00:49:13,119
I know. I told you the exact words
that the kidnapper used.

655
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:14,659
How much did the kidnapper demand?

656
00:49:15,159 --> 00:49:19,289
The kidnapper hasn't told me the amount.

657
00:49:21,559 --> 00:49:22,900
You recorded the conversation, right?

658
00:49:25,269 --> 00:49:28,099
Prepare money for his life
by 11pm sharp on Friday.

659
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:30,909
Or else, Han Guk will be killed.

660
00:49:35,909 --> 00:49:37,650
11pm sharp on Friday?

661
00:49:40,579 --> 00:49:42,619
Detective Go, you like
to be on a TV show, right?

662
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:45,119
What was the show where you blabbered
that I chose the victims randomly?

663
00:49:45,989 --> 00:49:48,059
I will kill the kid when the show ends...

664
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:50,829
- Prepare money by 11pm on Friday.
- 11pm on Friday?

665
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:52,730
That's when "Sherlock Hong Ju" ends.

666
00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:56,199
Do you think it'll be helpful to be
on the show as he requested?

667
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:59,630
Saving the child's life is the most
important thing in this situation.

668
00:50:00,139 --> 00:50:02,769
I don't know. Could he still be alive?

669
00:50:03,070 --> 00:50:04,440
Definitely.

670
00:50:04,739 --> 00:50:08,610
He needs the child to be alive
to show off his existence.

671
00:50:08,679 --> 00:50:10,449
"Bind", "torture", and "kill".

672
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,679
Those are what he did to his victims.

673
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:14,880
He called himself "BTK killer".

674
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:17,889
Since 1974 when he murdered
a family of four,

675
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,159
he killed at least 10 people in 30 years.

676
00:50:20,190 --> 00:50:22,860
He also kept sending letters
and the victims' belongings...

677
00:50:22,889 --> 00:50:24,960
to a TV network
as if he was laughing at the police.

678
00:50:25,130 --> 00:50:28,929
Likewise, psychopaths
who commit serial murders...

679
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,230
tend to want to brag about
their brutal crimes,

680
00:50:31,269 --> 00:50:33,400
and let more people know his existence.

681
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,739
It's a kind of exhibitionism.

682
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:38,539
We must let the show air
in order to catch him.

683
00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:41,780
The BTK killer
who perfectly disguised himself...

684
00:50:41,809 --> 00:50:44,179
as an ordinary public servant
was caught after 30 years...

685
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:46,650
because of the letters he sent
to the media and the police.

686
00:50:46,679 --> 00:50:49,079
He left his DNA in those letters.

687
00:50:49,219 --> 00:50:50,949
He left his DNA in letters?

688
00:50:50,989 --> 00:50:54,820
It was not intentional. He made
a mistake while trying to show off.

689
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:58,559
He's right. I heard from Professor Lee
while preparing for the last episode...

690
00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:01,800
that psychopaths like him
tend to be too confident...

691
00:51:01,829 --> 00:51:03,900
and make a mistake
that they would never make.

692
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,570
Correct. That's why Han Seo Joon,
also known as the Headhunter, was caught.

693
00:51:07,869 --> 00:51:09,639
He killed more than 20 people
only in 1 year...

694
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:12,070
without leaving any clues or witnesses,

695
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:14,210
but when he attacked
a family of four in a camper...

696
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:24,590
He thought there were
only three people in there,

697
00:51:25,449 --> 00:51:29,360
and didn't kill the youngest son.
He ended up getting arrested.

698
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:33,199
He made a careless mistake
because he was too confident.

699
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:36,570
(He sent letters to
the TV network to get attention.)

700
00:51:36,599 --> 00:51:37,670
Next.

701
00:51:37,769 --> 00:51:40,440
(Bingo! I salute
Detective Go Mu Chi's deduction skills.)

702
00:51:40,469 --> 00:51:42,900
The killer's urge to show off his ability
has reached its climax.

703
00:51:43,039 --> 00:51:45,610
If I lure him into a trap
by going up on the stage as he wants,

704
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:46,940
there's a good chance he gets trapped.

705
00:51:47,010 --> 00:51:49,409
He will make a big,
careless mistake for sure.

706
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:51,679
While he's dreaming of a theatrical crime,

707
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:54,019
we'll carry out
a theatrical investigation.

708
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:55,980
Also, if we go up on the stage,

709
00:51:56,019 --> 00:51:57,690
we'll likely get some information...

710
00:51:57,719 --> 00:52:00,059
about the killer
that we haven't figured out.

711
00:52:00,090 --> 00:52:02,659
Therefore, this show will be
very helpful for our investigation.

712
00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:05,889
By the way, do you think
you can figure out the correct answer?

713
00:52:05,929 --> 00:52:08,130
You have only four days left.

714
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:10,829
I will figure out the answer
no matter what.

715
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,099
If we do it upon the killer's request,

716
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:14,800
we'll get serious criticisms.

717
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:15,900
True. That's why...

718
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:18,840
we must prepare this operation in secret.

719
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:22,880
Sir, please trust me and let me do this.

720
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:25,409
Sir, please.

721
00:52:34,619 --> 00:52:36,360
All right. Let's do this.

722
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,170
(Influenza Vaccination Promotion Division)

723
00:52:48,199 --> 00:52:51,170
What? The police commissioner
and the director of OBN?

724
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:54,610
Detective Kang is with them too.

725
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:07,989
- What's going on?
- What do you mean?

726
00:53:08,019 --> 00:53:09,889
Come on. Don't play dumb.

727
00:53:10,429 --> 00:53:12,829
Why did the director of OBN's current
affairs department come all the way here?

728
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:15,929
I saw him talking to the commissioner
with a serious look on his face.

729
00:53:16,570 --> 00:53:18,530
Do you think I'll be a mole for you?

730
00:53:18,599 --> 00:53:20,369
Find out whatever you want to know
by yourself!

731
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:24,869
Gosh. Wait, Detective Kang.

732
00:53:37,849 --> 00:53:38,989
(I finished editing the video.
Can you come and check?)

733
00:53:43,829 --> 00:53:44,860
(Sherlock Hong Ju)

734
00:54:15,489 --> 00:54:17,460
Seven people were killed
or attacked by him.

735
00:54:17,489 --> 00:54:19,590
He killed Song Soo Ho out of anger.
So, exclude him.

736
00:54:19,630 --> 00:54:21,659
And it's presumed that he killed
the lady at Gudong to prevent...

737
00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:24,199
his identity from being revealed
as she took a photo from him. Exclude her.

738
00:54:24,369 --> 00:54:27,639
I said that the killer randomly chose
the other five victims.

739
00:54:27,969 --> 00:54:29,170
But they weren't chosen randomly.

740
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:31,369
We must figure out why he chose them...

741
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:34,280
before the show airs.

742
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:37,949
Let's go to see the victims'
families and friends again.

743
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:40,619
You'll be able to find a similarity
of victims' characteristics.

744
00:54:41,679 --> 00:54:43,719
How long have you known Chi Gook?

745
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:45,190
We've been friends since high school.

746
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:46,690
Then you must know him well.

747
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:48,219
Tell me about him.

748
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:50,630
Anything would do.
Tell me anything you can think of.

749
00:54:52,090 --> 00:54:53,159
Why are you asking that?

750
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:55,260
Does it have anything to do
with catching the culprit?

751
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:58,369
- The thing is...
- Ba Reum.

752
00:54:59,769 --> 00:55:01,900
Oh, hello.
Detective, you should watch this.

753
00:55:03,170 --> 00:55:05,039
We'll let you hear the conversation...

754
00:55:05,110 --> 00:55:08,480
between Detective Go Mu Chi and the killer
that was found exclusively by SBC.

755
00:55:08,510 --> 00:55:10,309
We didn't edit the recording
to let you hear it as it is.

756
00:55:10,349 --> 00:55:11,750
Why will that kid have to die?

757
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:13,309
What did the kid do wrong?

758
00:55:13,650 --> 00:55:15,780
Detective Go, you like
to be on a TV show, right?

759
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:18,590
What was the show where you blabbered
that I chose the victims randomly?

760
00:55:19,219 --> 00:55:21,789
Find out the reason why I chose
the kid on that show.

761
00:55:23,159 --> 00:55:25,960
Make sure you're sober.
Take this seriously.

762
00:55:26,159 --> 00:55:28,159
Darn it.

763
00:55:28,929 --> 00:55:30,730
The shock doesn't end here.

764
00:55:30,969 --> 00:55:33,070
Mujin Police Station's
Special Task Force...

765
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:36,440
is preparing a broadcast in secret
and I just got a tip about it.

766
00:55:37,139 --> 00:55:40,039
Should the police
prepare a broadcast as...

767
00:55:40,139 --> 00:55:42,840
the serial killer demands,
all the while being dragged around?

768
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:44,309
The decision is for you to make.

769
00:55:44,409 --> 00:55:47,019
- Is the call true?
- Are you preparing a show?

770
00:55:47,079 --> 00:55:49,179
Is the police doing what a killer asked?

771
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:50,690
- Say something.
- Detective!

772
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:53,150
- What do you have to say?
- Any comments?

773
00:55:53,219 --> 00:55:55,420
- Give us a comment.
- What do you say?

774
00:55:55,489 --> 00:55:56,659
Detective!

775
00:55:56,730 --> 00:55:58,590
- Who's the killer?
- What's the plan?

776
00:55:58,659 --> 00:56:01,559
- Can you save the kid?
- Detective!

777
00:56:01,630 --> 00:56:02,659
Go Mu Chi.

778
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:12,670
Do you remember me?

779
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,409
Did you see the killer's face?

780
00:56:14,639 --> 00:56:17,380
Answer me! Did you or did you not?

781
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:18,880
I don't.

782
00:56:19,150 --> 00:56:20,420
Don't do the broadcast.

783
00:56:30,289 --> 00:56:31,889
Inspector Park Du Seok.

784
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:36,329
Why do you think
I'm still at this disgusting job?

785
00:56:37,929 --> 00:56:39,170
Han Seo Joon.

786
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:42,570
I will catch him and kill him myself.

787
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:45,440
He killed my mom and dad.

788
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:47,539
He killed your kids.

789
00:56:48,409 --> 00:56:51,250
To do that, I must catch and kill...

790
00:56:51,309 --> 00:56:53,849
a psycho like him to go where he is.

791
00:56:53,949 --> 00:56:57,519
Even if the whole world disagrees,
you shouldn't try to stop me.

792
00:56:59,449 --> 00:57:00,519
Han Seo Joon.

793
00:57:02,190 --> 00:57:04,190
Do you know why he killed my kids?

794
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:08,530
Because I didn't know him well,

795
00:57:08,730 --> 00:57:10,630
and I went on TV,

796
00:57:11,230 --> 00:57:12,929
and I got in his face.

797
00:57:14,070 --> 00:57:15,500
Don't you do the same.

798
00:57:15,869 --> 00:57:19,539
I think that this guy is no human being.

799
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:21,539
He's a monster.

800
00:57:22,409 --> 00:57:25,579
He's probably worse than Han Seo Joon.

801
00:57:26,679 --> 00:57:29,119
Is he? Good, then.

802
00:57:30,190 --> 00:57:32,789
A fight's worth it
if you're up against a worthy foe.

803
00:57:32,849 --> 00:57:34,320
Don't you get what I'm saying?

804
00:57:34,889 --> 00:57:37,730
You might lose
what's most important to you.

805
00:57:41,730 --> 00:57:43,500
What's most important to me?

806
00:57:45,030 --> 00:57:47,039
I lost it all when I was eight.

807
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:48,840
You saw it.

808
00:57:50,710 --> 00:57:52,309
I have nothing more to lose.

He tossed bait and the police took it.

810
00:58:05,619 --> 00:58:07,820
When a criminal demands a ransom,

811
00:58:07,889 --> 00:58:09,659
the police must never reciprocate.

812
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,630
A killer took a child hostage...

813
00:58:11,690 --> 00:58:14,800
and demands a broadcast
that reports why he killed?

814
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:17,730
The police did as he asked
and that is unforgivable.

815
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:20,030
But there's no other option at the moment.

816
00:58:20,199 --> 00:58:21,699
He wants them to answer him on TV.

817
00:58:21,769 --> 00:58:23,340
Can they guarantee
they'll find the answer?

818
00:58:23,469 --> 00:58:27,110
What if their conclusion is wrong?
Won't that put the child in worse danger?

819
00:58:27,179 --> 00:58:28,840
Is there anything
more important than life?

820
00:58:28,909 --> 00:58:30,849
They must find the correct answer...

821
00:58:30,909 --> 00:58:33,210
and save the child first.
That's what I think.

822
00:58:33,349 --> 00:58:35,179
They're listening to a psycho killer...

823
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:38,219
to play a game and solve a riddle
just to broadcast it on TV.

824
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:41,059
Is that truly the best our country...

825
00:58:41,159 --> 00:58:43,630
and authority can do to save a child?

826
00:58:43,989 --> 00:58:45,659
Cancel the broadcast!

827
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:47,500
- Cancel, cancel!
- Cancel, cancel!

828
00:58:57,639 --> 00:59:00,110
The commissioner wants us to drop it.

829
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:04,650
- But...
- As you know,

830
00:59:04,909 --> 00:59:06,250
the public sentiment is bad.

831
00:59:06,309 --> 00:59:09,079
If we go ahead with the broadcast
and the kid ends up dead,

832

there will be no way out.

About what?

902
01:03:34,349 --> 01:03:38,119
My first interview when I was on probation
was of a teenager who got an award.

01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:41,119
You're the teenager I interviewed.

904
01:03:42,159 --> 01:03:44,929
You refused to talk to me
and gave me such a hard time.

905
01:03:44,989 --> 01:03:46,960
He said he didn't do anything,
that it was all his friend.

906
01:03:47,059 --> 01:03:48,559
That's all he said in the interview.

I'm sorry, but we're here from the police.

966
01:06:45,110 --> 01:06:47,340
Byun Soon Young, early 30s.

967
01:06:47,710 --> 01:06:49,380
Worked in the kitchen
of a beef restaurant.

968
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:53,809
Park Jung Oh, mid-20s.

969
01:06:54,050 --> 01:06:55,849
Temporary worker at
a subcontracting company.

970
01:06:57,349 --> 01:06:58,719
I can wear this for a while.

971
01:06:59,449 --> 01:07:00,989
Do you know this person?

972
01:07:01,019 --> 01:07:03,320
Mr. Kim, estimated to be in his 50s.

973
01:07:04,059 --> 01:07:06,230
He's homeless, so his identity
has not yet been confirmed.

974
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:12,329
Cho Mi Jeong, college student
in her early 20s.

975
01:07:12,730 --> 01:07:14,340
She was active as a mukbang YouTuber.

976
01:07:16,639 --> 01:07:19,010
Na Chi Gook, mid-20s.

977
01:07:19,539 --> 01:07:21,179
An officer at the Mujin Detention Center.

978
01:07:21,679 --> 01:07:24,110
The sole survivor, he remains unconscious.

979
01:08:07,989 --> 01:08:09,219
That's right.

980
01:08:09,989 --> 01:08:12,929
It's not important to find out
how these people are related.

981
01:08:14,199 --> 01:08:18,229
I need to figure out how
he came to choose these people.

982
01:08:19,399 --> 01:08:21,199
You have to think from his perspective.

983
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:23,699
Think like him.

984
01:08:32,010 --> 01:08:34,220
The reason that scumbag chose this person.

985
01:08:42,390 --> 01:08:43,619
(Sherlock Hong Ju)

986
01:08:43,659 --> 01:08:45,960
Here we go, 5 seconds to air.

987
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:49,300
3, 2, 1.

988
01:08:49,699 --> 01:08:50,800
Cue.

989
01:08:52,970 --> 01:08:56,939
(Sherlock Hong Ju)

990
01:08:56,970 --> 01:08:59,010
(Fix your left collar, Ms. Choi.)

991
01:09:00,810 --> 01:09:02,909
I'm Choi Hong Ju, of Sherlock Hong Ju.

992
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:05,680
Today, on Sherlock Hong Ju,
as previewed last time,

993
01:09:05,779 --> 01:09:08,479
we had planned to investigate
the state of diet drugs,

994
01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:11,619
but we have a special live broadcast
on an urgent issue instead.

995
01:09:12,090 --> 01:09:15,060
I'm sure you all know...

996
01:09:15,460 --> 01:09:16,890
about the serial murders
that have shaken our country.

997
01:09:17,460 --> 01:09:21,460
The criminal requested this program
himself, risking his life.

998
01:09:22,029 --> 01:09:23,859
Many people were opposed,

999
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:26,729
and we were about to give up
on the program.

1000
01:09:27,539 --> 01:09:30,199
However, Han Guk's mother
made a plea to us,

1001
01:09:31,039 --> 01:09:33,909
a plea which we could not ignore.

1002
01:09:37,180 --> 01:09:40,920
Therefore, we have decided
to participate in his show.

1003
01:09:41,479 --> 01:09:44,949
Here is the detective
in charge of the case: Go Mu Chi.

1004
01:10:17,590 --> 01:10:19,520
I think it's been 3 or 4 days
since he passed away.

1005
01:10:38,239 --> 01:10:39,810
The 28th.

1006
01:10:41,939 --> 01:10:44,750
If it's 8:10pm on the 28th,

1007
01:10:45,979 --> 01:10:47,949
That's when Detective Go
was conducting his investigation.

1008
01:10:49,579 --> 01:10:51,449
Does that mean he killed Kim Joon Sung...

1009
01:10:58,289 --> 01:11:00,390
and called him from here?

1010
01:11:01,060 --> 01:11:03,430
I'll ask you frankly, Detective Go.

1011
01:11:03,930 --> 01:11:05,399
Have you found the answer?

1012
01:11:06,329 --> 01:11:08,970
Will we be able to save Han Guk?

1013
01:11:11,369 --> 01:11:12,640
Let me ask you once more.

1014
01:11:13,670 --> 01:11:16,510
Did you find the answer?

1015
01:11:18,710 --> 01:11:19,880
I did.

1016
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:29,119
In that case,

1017
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:32,390
how did the murderer choose his victims?

1018
01:11:34,829 --> 01:11:36,130
Before I tell you the answer,

1019
01:11:36,930 --> 01:11:38,170
I need to confirm one thing.

1020
01:11:42,170 --> 01:11:43,199
You're watching, aren't you?

1021
01:11:45,710 --> 01:11:48,979
You've asked me to identify
how you chose your victims.

1022
01:11:51,180 --> 01:11:52,579
If you want to hear it that badly,

1023
01:11:53,350 --> 01:11:55,420
you need to confirm if you're
really you, that you called,

1024
01:11:55,449 --> 01:11:57,119
asking for this broadcast,

1025
01:11:57,479 --> 01:11:59,890
and that Han Guk is still alive.

1026
01:12:02,319 --> 01:12:03,859
That way, the game is fair.

1027
01:12:06,289 --> 01:12:07,359
You have my number, right?

1028
01:12:08,399 --> 01:12:10,029
If you do that, I'll tell you...

1029
01:12:10,060 --> 01:12:12,729
exactly why you chose
the victims that you did.

1030
01:13:15,029 --> 01:13:17,659
(Mouse)

1031
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,970
The only reason I'm doing this show
is to save Han Guk.

1032
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:24,039
This show is the only way
we can save Han Guk.

1033
01:13:24,199 --> 01:13:27,140
They say an object confirmed
to be from the criminal...

1034
01:13:27,170 --> 01:13:28,609
has arrived at the studio.

1035
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:31,510
We request minors or those
who are weak of heart...

1036
01:13:31,810 --> 01:13:33,479
to refrain from watching
the following footage.

1037
01:13:33,550 --> 01:13:35,020
Na Chi Gook, Na Chi Gook.

1038
01:13:35,449 --> 01:13:36,979
It's not Na Chi Gook.

1039
01:13:37,579 --> 01:13:39,789
I got it. What the victims
all have in common.

1040
01:13:40,319 --> 01:13:41,460
Stop this already and reveal yourself.

1041
01:13:41,489 --> 01:13:42,420
(Officer Jung Ba Reum)

1042
01:13:44,159 --> 01:13:46,260
You're not even human.

1043
01:13:46,689 --> 01:13:48,859
Just a monster who can never
achieve salvation.

1044
01:13:48,899 --> 01:13:51,100
We've just received
information on Han Guk.

1045
01:13:51,430 --> 01:13:52,930
Let me go.

1046
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:55,100
Turn it off now, you crazy fool!

1047
01:13:55,140 --> 01:13:57,340
I'm disappointed you have
so little trust in me.

1048
01:13:57,739 --> 01:14:00,010
How about now? Do you trust me now?
