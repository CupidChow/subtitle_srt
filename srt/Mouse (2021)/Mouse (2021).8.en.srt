What did he say?

16
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,680
What's the matter?
Did something happen in there?

17
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:23,750
It's not Han Seo Joon.

18
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,379
What?

19
00:02:25,449 --> 00:02:27,250
Han Seo Joon didn't tie this knot.

20
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:29,789
- This knot.
- I never tied it,

21
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:32,590
learned it, or taught it...

22
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,129
to anyone.

23
00:02:34,189 --> 00:02:36,259
He said he never taught it, learned it,

24
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:37,500
or showed it to anyone.

25
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:40,500
Do you believe his lies? You're so naive.

26
00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:42,669
It's definitely not Han Seo Joon's knot.

27
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:45,270
The protruding part of the knot
was on the right.

28
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:49,409
But here, on this knot, it's on the left.

29
00:02:50,009 --> 00:02:51,680
There was a knot around the mouse's head?

30
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,650
Hey, Officer Kim!

31
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:56,550
Officer Kim!

32
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,219
What a freak.

33
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,620
What did he do to the mouse's head?

34
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,819
Look. The knot's tied to the right.

35
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:05,490
If it were tied by the same person,
even if they used a different knot,

36
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,289
it would finish on the same side.

37
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:10,729
All the records we have of Dr. Han's
surgeries are our teaching material.

38
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:12,530
He's left-handed.

39
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,800
Why are all his knots to the right?

40
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,199
Some doctors are like that.

41
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,439
There are right-handed baseball players...

42
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,710
who prefer to bat with their left hand.

43
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:23,069

(Noh Young Hoon, Head of Neurosurgery)

45
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:29,250
That means Han Seo Joon
didn't kill Inspector Park's daughter.

46
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:31,849
There are two possibilities.
It wasn't Han Seo Joon,

47
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,849
or Han Seo Joon's the killer
but someone else tied the knot.

48
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:36,319

54
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:42,949
There was a dent in this tree...

55
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:45,319
and the car's taillight was smashed.

56
00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:47,160
He faked an accident to lure her.

57
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,459
But don't you find it strange?

58
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:50,959
What is?

59
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:55,170
The taxi driver said he dropped off
Song Soo Jung here.

60
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:11,350
There was a public telephone at the time.

61
00:05:11,949 --> 00:05:14,850
Song Soo Jung
called her brother Soo Ho from it.

62
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:19,120
If he dragged her off,
he wouldn't have faked an accident.

63
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:22,459
How did he take her to where the car was?

64
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,000
Even if there was an accident,
it was past midnight.

65
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,470
It wouldn't be easy to follow a stranger.

66
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,699
Right. A woman on her own and in the snow.

67
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:33,870
What if it was...

68
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:37,540
not Han Seo Joon but someone
she didn't have to be wary about?

69
00:05:40,509 --> 00:05:41,850
He had an accomplice.

70
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,620
Let's visit the substation that
took the call. They might have a record.

71
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,019
(Crashed car found in a lot
150m from the trail entrance.)

72
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,089
What's this?

73
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:58,000
A witness? There was
no mention in the case file.

74
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,399
I didn't think a man
with a child in tow...

75
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:02,529
would go around
cutting off people's heads,

76
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,240
so I didn't report it.

77
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,899
A child?

78
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,970
Not many cars take this road.

79
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:11,279
But I saw one drive right in.

80
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:15,209
I know all the neighbors' cars
and I didn't recognize that one.

81
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:19,279
I couldn't see the driver
because of the headlights,

82
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:23,519
but I got a glimpse of a little boy
in the passenger seat.

83
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,389
A little boy?

84
00:06:25,689 --> 00:06:27,329
This one looks lousier...

85
00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:29,560
as if a young kid had tied it.

86
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:32,500
He looked like he was about 10 years old.

87
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:36,370
Han Seo Joon didn't have any kids then.

88
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:37,899
Right.

89
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,170
No boys of that age
were reported missing around that time.

90
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:44,279
Is this everyone
reported missing nationwide?

91
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:46,009
- No one's missing?
- No.

92
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:49,980
Do you think Han Seo Joon
really used a child to lure his victims?

93
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:53,790
If that kid grew up to be
a second Han Seo Joon...

94
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:56,889
Just the thought terrifies me.

95
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,189
It's just an inference.

96
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,360
Let's find a mutual male acquaintance
in his 30s between both victims.

97
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,860
(Kang Min Joo, Hong Na Ri)

98
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,560
(Cho Ho Young, aged 33)

99
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:07,829
Among the victims' acquaintances,
no one in their 30s...

100
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:11,540
is from an orphanage or could've
helped Han Seo Joon 25 years ago.

101
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,540
Not only that, Kang Min Joo
and Hong Na Ri...

102
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:15,970
can't be connected by job or school.

103
00:07:16,209 --> 00:07:17,779
I just don't get it.

104
00:07:18,339 --> 00:07:20,139
It was definitely someone they know.

105
00:07:20,709 --> 00:07:22,209
- Someone they know?
- Yes.

106
00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:23,920
We have Kang Min Joo on camera...

107
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,819
smiling like this
as she gets into the car.

108
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:29,189
And there were no signs of forced entry
into Kang Min Joo's home.

109
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,759
That means she opened the door.

110
00:07:30,819 --> 00:07:34,029
They both definitely knew their killer.

111
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,259
No.

112
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,430
The victims probably didn't know him.

113
00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:39,629
He definitely enjoyed committing
these murders.

114
00:07:41,269 --> 00:07:42,300
If I were him,

115
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,769
I'd never kill those
I'm acquainted with...

116
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,370
because I'd want to continue doing this
without getting caught.

117
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:48,910
You foolish kid.

118
00:07:48,939 --> 00:07:52,040
Would you get in a stranger's car...

119
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:54,509
while smiling like this?

120
00:07:54,579 --> 00:07:57,980
And would a woman who's living alone
welcome a stranger into her house?

121
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:00,949
- But...
- We're definitely failing to see...

122
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:03,189
the person who's linked
with both of them.

123
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:05,759
We need to start from the get-go
once again.

124
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,829
That's what we need to do
at times like this.

125
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:10,660
When we're stuck,
we need to start from the beginning.

126
00:08:17,899 --> 00:08:20,970
What? This was indeed tampered with.

127
00:08:21,009 --> 00:08:22,709
See? I told you.

128
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,250
There.

129
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,320
Who is that?

130
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:46,429
She had been reinstated
and has been waiting to be assigned.

Detective's Daughter Found Dead")

133
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:21,299
(Hong Na Ri, Kang Min Joo)

134
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:23,470
Why would you be looking into this?

135
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,990
I see you're well and healthy.

136
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:47,289
It's good to see you, Officer Jung.

137
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:52,330
Why do I feel a zap?

138
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:27,929
- Sorry. I wasn't trying to deceive you.
- Don't you know...

139
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:29,399
you're not supposed to touch
crime scene evidence?

140
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,399
We have you on CCTV,
so don't try to feign ignorance.

141
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:38,610
I saw wounds on Hong Na Ri's wrists
while looking through the photos.

142
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,309
It seemed like she had been tied up.

143
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,909
I had gone to her house to check.

144
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:46,019
That's where I overheard you
and Officer Jung speaking.

145
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,649
The MO is different from
Kang Min Joo's case.

146
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,649
The latter was kidnapped, killed,
and disposed in different places.

147
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,759
- I wanted to see the knot myself.
- And why would you do that?

148
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,230
Here.

149
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:09,870
Is it related to that?

150
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:17,279
Yes. I wanted to check
if the knots on these two victims...

151
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:20,720
coincided with the knot...

152
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,649
- on Inspector Park's daughter.
- How did you know?

153
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:25,889
How did you know
that the knots were similar?

154
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,860
While preparing for the documentary
on the death penalty,

155
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:32,029
I saw the knot on the girl
in the materials regarding the Headhunter.

156
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:34,000
I remembered it because the knot
was unique.

157
00:11:34,169 --> 00:11:36,799
I was looking into it because I had seen
a similar knot recently.

158
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,100
Don't be absurd.

159
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,340
A photo of Kang Min Joo being tied up
was released to the public...

160
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:41,840
but not the shape of the knot.

161
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:42,970
So how did you know?

162
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:45,509
Tell me the truth.

163
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:47,649
I didn't see her knot.

164
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:55,750
- She may not be the first victim.
- Gosh, you're so adorable.

165
00:11:55,789 --> 00:11:58,220
Perhaps, the killings may have had started
a month before then.

166
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:01,960
Well done, Doochi.

167
00:12:02,429 --> 00:12:03,559
Gosh.

168
00:12:04,629 --> 00:12:06,899
As soon as I had gotten reinstated,
a lady came to me.

169
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:09,399
She said her daughter
may have been murdered.

170
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,769
Oh, hello.

171
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:48,269
The police thought she had just run away.

172
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,009
- "Run away"?
- Yes.

173
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:53,740
When her dog was hanged?

174
00:12:53,909 --> 00:12:56,350
Kim Young Hee had been suffering
from severe depression.

175
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:59,419
The police believed her depression
had spiraled out of control...

176
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:01,590
and that she had killed her dog
then ran away.

177
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,320
They reported her disappearance
and closed the case.

178
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,360
They saw the knot, yet still deemed it so?

179
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:07,759
The knot wasn't placed here.

180
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:11,460
On the day of the crime,
a handcart had disappeared from the park.

181
00:13:13,129 --> 00:13:14,500
The killer probably didn't know...

182
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:17,870
that the dog had chewed on the knot
and loosened it.

183
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:21,039
It was found here.

184
00:13:21,139 --> 00:13:24,110
The police couldn't find it
because it was so far away from the park.

185
00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:26,779
You should've handed the knot
over to the police. Why did you keep it?

186
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:28,149
Give it to me.

187
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:32,279
I'll give it to you under one condition.

188
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,950
- What is it?
- I'm going to do an exclusive coverage.

189
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,350
I want to revive "Sherlock Hong Ju".

190
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,259
So share every single information
you retrieve...

191
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,860
from this case.

192
00:13:41,889 --> 00:13:43,059
No. I don't like working with you.

193
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:44,929
Do you think I do?

194
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,960
I can't just sit idly
until I get assigned.

195
00:13:47,929 --> 00:13:49,500
I refuse to get fired.

196
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,870
What's the real reason?

197
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,070
- What?
- I can see through you.

198
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,980
You want to catch him.

199
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,279
Why are you hell-bent on catching him?

200
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:07,549
Do you know a producer
called Choi Hong Ju?

201
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,220
Of course. She pretty much lived
at your house...

202
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,889
while you guys were tracking down
Sung Yo Han.

203
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:12,720
Do you remember her now?

204
00:14:16,529 --> 00:14:19,029
- Did I...
- Yes?

205
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,200
Gosh, just ask already. What is it?

206
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,240
Did I like her?

207
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:31,940
What? You?

208
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,480
Gosh, that's all you can think about?

209
00:14:34,809 --> 00:14:37,250
Hey, you shouldn't do that to Bong Yi.

210
00:14:37,379 --> 00:14:38,519
"Bong Yi"?

211
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:43,250
You mean Oh Bong Yi,
the girl you mentioned often?

212
00:14:43,289 --> 00:14:46,059
Yes. Oh Bong Yi. Look at you.

213
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:49,090
You remember Ms. Choi but not Bong Yi?

214
00:14:49,129 --> 00:14:50,860
That's not right.

215
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:53,500
Bong Yi was worried sick about you.

216
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,539
It's not like I don't want
to remember her.

217
00:14:58,570 --> 00:14:59,799
I just can't.

218
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,490
What was that memory?

219
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,879
Ba Reum.

220
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,879
- Hey.
- What are you looking for?

221
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,549
Some photo albums.

222
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,250
Perhaps, photos of me
back in kindergarten.

223
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,620
Why all of a sudden?

224
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,129
I think my memories from the past
are slowly coming back to me.

225
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:58,500
Is that so? I'm glad.

226
00:15:58,929 --> 00:16:01,669
I think I have a few back home.
I'll bring them over next time.

227
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,940
Really? Thank you.

228
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:07,600
- Aunt.
- Yes?

229
00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:09,470
What is this birdcage?

230
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:13,740
Before the accident, you had a pet bird.

231
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,679
I have a vague memory of it.

232
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:24,120
- But where's the bird?
- You didn't have dinner, did you?

233
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,059
I brought some cheonggukjang,
your favorite.

234
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,529
Cheonggukjang...

235
00:16:32,929 --> 00:16:34,429
What is it? Does it make you nauseous?

236
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,330
- Yes.
- I'll get rid of it.

237
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,139
I'm sorry.

238
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,009
By the way, your taste must have changed.

239
00:16:44,139 --> 00:16:47,139
Back then, you'd die
for some cheonggukjang.

240
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:52,850
Yes?

241
00:16:53,549 --> 00:16:54,990
Yes, that's me.

242
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:57,389
Redevelopment Office?

243
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:59,620
So you're saying
the same killer murdered...

244
00:16:59,659 --> 00:17:01,759
Kim Young Hee, Kang Min Joo,
and Hong Na Ri?

245
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:04,859
There could be some epithelial tissues,
so you should call the NFS.

246
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,259
Got it.

247
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,500
Let me catch this scumbag.

248
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:11,869
What kind of mess will you get into
this time around?

249
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:14,339
You're part of the Evidence Storage Team,
not the Serious Crime Team.

250
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:16,509
You know very well that I belong here.

251
00:17:16,539 --> 00:17:18,480
How long do I need to rot in that team?

252
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,509
I need to achieve something
in order to return here.

253
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,009
Give me one chance.

254
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:24,480
I'll bring him to your office.

255
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,250
Don't look at me like that.

256
00:17:30,289 --> 00:17:32,559
Fine, but only until the results come out.

257
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,289
Hey, what are you doing? Stop it.

258
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,759
It will be demolished before the election.

259
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:46,740
Hi, Eo Beong Yi.

260
00:19:04,349 --> 00:19:06,180
- No! Please don't!
- Bong Yi!

261
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:09,049
Oh Bong Yi. Bong Yi.

262
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:18,859
- Oh Bong Yi.
- Gosh.

263
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,170
I'm sorry.

264
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,339
Oh, my baby. My poor baby.

265
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,599
Officer Jung.

266
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,869
Can you check in on Bong Yi...

267
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:32,140
from time to time...

268
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,579
and see if she's doing okay?

269
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,589
She stopped coming to school
after what happened to her grandmother.

270
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:48,089
It's a shame. Graduation was
just around the corner.

271
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:56,369
I give in. I surrender.

272
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:58,400
Will you marry me, Bong Yi?

273
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:01,099
After you graduate,

274
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,069
marry me.

275
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,240
Where are you, Oh Bong Yi?

276
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:42,250
Stay here just for a while.

277
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:48,819
It must've been hard for you.

278
00:20:50,589 --> 00:20:52,660
But she'll need a comfortable place...

279
00:20:53,089 --> 00:20:55,160
to give birth.

280
00:21:04,369 --> 00:21:05,569
Wait a little while.

281
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,900
I'll make a pretty house for you.

282
00:21:10,609 --> 00:21:12,039
Wait just a little while.

283
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,240
I'll make it for you quickly.

284
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:31,190
Why did you call me out so early
in the morning?

285
00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:34,359
- Over there.
- What about it?

286
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:37,799
I took these photos around Kim Young Hee
and Kang Min Joo's houses last night.

287
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,150
Their houses and the neighborhood
seem quite old, right?

288
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:58,390
There are molds and cracks
on the walls and the ceilings.

289
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:01,690
- So?
- But...

290
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:06,000
Don't the window guards look new?

291
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,170
You're right.

292
00:22:15,109 --> 00:22:16,509
This one is new too.

293
00:22:18,339 --> 00:22:20,309
The employee who installed
the window guards.

294
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,480
That's why the victims weren't
suspicious of him,

295
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:24,150
and he's not their mutual acquaintance.

296
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:26,880
This model was provided
by the city government.

297
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:30,720
It was for women who lived alone
in the crime-prone areas.

298
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:32,059
Who installed them?

299
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,390
Some volunteers did.

300
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,289
It was a campaign conducted in association
with the member companies...

301
00:22:35,329 --> 00:22:36,559
of the Korea Crime Prevention Association.

302
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:37,660
Ma'am.

303
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,599
Does that dog live here?

304
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:42,130
Yes. It was an abandoned dog.
The volunteers take turns...

305
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,730
to look after it.

306
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,970
Detective Go, Kim Young Hee's dog
was white too, right?

307
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,140
Yes.

308
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:58,250
Inspector Bok, please check
if a different dog's fur is mixed...

309
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:01,549
with the dog fur
found on Kim Young Hee's hairband.

310
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:03,420
Can you tell us who installed
the window guards?

311
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:05,720
Since it was a temporary event,

312
00:23:05,789 --> 00:23:07,859
and a lot of people volunteered,

313
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:09,990
we didn't make a list of the volunteers.

314
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,670
Many of the volunteers are well-known
in different fields.

315
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:18,069
- There's a company CEO...
- It's hard to tell where that is...

316
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,339
since it's such a tight close-up shot.

317
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,039
Do you have the original file
of this photo?

318
00:23:21,769 --> 00:23:23,609
- This place is what?
- It's near Hong Na Ri's house.

319
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:25,710
What makes you sure of it?

320
00:23:26,109 --> 00:23:27,809
Here. Look at this.

321
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,009
I saw a storage cabinet in the veranda
of the house next to Hong Na Ri's.

322
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:32,819
And the same turtle stickers were
on the cabinet.

323
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,220
How did you know this?

324
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:37,619
When we came here,
I saw it on the way out.

325
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,519
- And you remember these stickers?
- Yes.

326
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:42,559
Did the brain surgery make you a genius?

327
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:46,500
You may be right. Dong Goo told me
that I wasn't so smart...

328
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,000
before the surgery.

329
00:23:48,529 --> 00:23:49,569
Exactly.

330
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:52,299
(Wise Women Stay Safe)

331
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,470
I'm Director Choi Hong Ju of OBN,
and I'm preparing...

332
00:23:55,539 --> 00:23:57,109
to make a documentary
about crimes against women.

333
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:01,009
My daughter in college lives alone.
It reminded me of her.

334
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:03,509
I have five daughters and no son.
When I hear about such crimes,

335
00:24:03,579 --> 00:24:06,019
- I feel as if it could happen to them.
- I thought of my daughter.

336
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:07,349
- That's why I applied for this.
- Isn't she pretty?

337
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:10,250
I found out that it's a girl.
Thinking that I'll be a father soon...

338
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:13,160
made me want to contribute
to making this world safer...

339
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:16,490
for all the daughters in the world.
So I decided to participate in it.

340
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,200
Thank you for your participation.

341
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:20,500
We prepared a little gift for you.

342
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:21,930
You didn't have to do this.

343
00:24:23,569 --> 00:24:24,839
Two of them are using their left hands.

344
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,970
Jeong Man Ho and Kim Baek Gi.

345
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,769
I think it's Jeong Man Ho.
His face seemed expressionless.

346
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:30,740
- I thought of my daughter.
- Hey.

347
00:24:31,009 --> 00:24:32,839
- You don't have a daughter.
- He lied too.

348
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:37,009
Why? What are you pondering on?

349
00:24:37,849 --> 00:24:40,720
He killed Kim Young Hee's dog brutally.

350
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,089
- So?
- Thank you.

351
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:44,519
Can we interview a few of them again?

352
00:24:44,619 --> 00:24:45,960
Mr. Kim Baek Gi and Mr. Jeong Man Ho.

353
00:24:46,019 --> 00:24:48,390
- Of course.
- And Mr. Woo Hyeong Cheol too.

354
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:49,660
Why did you ask for me?

355
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:53,099
Please wait here for a moment.
They're setting up the camera.

356
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,299
How cute.

357
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:59,299
They'll be here shortly. Please sit down.

358
00:25:08,509 --> 00:25:09,750
It's Jeong Man Ho as we expected, right?

359
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:12,180
I could see how much he hates dogs.

360
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:13,220
No.

361
00:25:14,819 --> 00:25:16,519
- Woo Hyeong Cheol?
- I'm sure of it.

362
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:17,950
Watch this.

363
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:21,319
Kim Baek Gi, Jeong Man Ho,
and all the other volunteers...

364
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:22,730
are using consistent hand gestures
while speaking.

365
00:25:23,259 --> 00:25:24,329
But...

366
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:27,329
Woo Hyeong Cheol is using
exaggerated hand gestures.

367
00:25:28,329 --> 00:25:29,400
Especially right here.

368
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:32,200
When he was saying that he wanted
to contribute...

369
00:25:32,269 --> 00:25:34,910
to making this world safer
for all the daughters in the world,

370
00:25:35,009 --> 00:25:37,440
he made big gestures
like an actor on stage.

371
00:25:37,509 --> 00:25:40,009
As if he was explaining
something that he couldn't understand.

372
00:25:40,109 --> 00:25:42,079
I think you jumped to a conclusion
only based on their gestures.

373
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:43,680
That's why I confirmed it again.

374
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,220
Can we interview a few of them again?

375
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:49,190
I petted the dog exactly the same way
in front of the three of them.

376
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:53,190
I petted it on its neck, sides,
and under its tail.

377
00:25:53,259 --> 00:25:54,420
In that same order.

378
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:57,990
Jeong Man Ho seemed uncomfortable
to even pet the dog.

379
00:25:58,059 --> 00:26:01,799
Kim Baek Gi and Woo Hyeong Cheol seemed
to pet it affectionally.

380
00:26:01,869 --> 00:26:04,730
However, Kim Baek Gi petted it
around its neck, sides,

381
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,200
and behind its ears,

382
00:26:06,269 --> 00:26:08,809
while Woo Hyeong Cheol petted it
around its neck, sides,

383
00:26:08,869 --> 00:26:10,839
and under its tail...

384
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:12,579
just as I petted in front of him.

385
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,710
- What does that mean?
- Most dogs...

386
00:26:15,009 --> 00:26:17,150
don't like being petted under their tails.

387
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:20,150
So those who like dogs would never
pet a dog under its tail.

388
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,890
- Then why did Woo Hyeong Cheol...
- Because of me.

389
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:26,190
I petted the dog under its tail
in front of all three of them.

390
00:26:26,289 --> 00:26:29,130
Woo Hyeong Cheol saw me doing it,

391
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:30,829
and petted it on exactly the same areas
including under its tail...

392
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:33,259
in the same order as I did.

393
00:26:33,329 --> 00:26:34,759
He copied me exactly.

394
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:37,799
He didn't pet the dog
because he really likes them.

395
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,500
In front of me, a policeman,
to pretend that he likes dogs,

396
00:26:40,539 --> 00:26:43,970
he stroked the dog
even under the tail, just for show.

397
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,240
It's definitely Woo Hyeong Cheol.

398
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:47,309
What about the knot?

399
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:49,279
He finished the knot on the right.

400
00:26:49,309 --> 00:26:53,180
He noticed long ago
that this interview is fake.

401
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,690
So instead of using his usual knot,

402
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,049
he used a different one.

403
00:26:57,089 --> 00:26:58,660
- Look at this.
- The bereaved...

404
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,589
This was when Woo Hyeong Cheol was on TV.

405
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,630
He hopes their wishes are respected...

406
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,890
Look. He's holding the pen
in his left hand.

407
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,400
He's left-handed.

408
00:27:06,859 --> 00:27:08,799
But he tied the knot to the right.

409
00:27:08,829 --> 00:27:10,400
To look like he's right-handed.

410
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:17,539
Hey. Did you study
psychopaths or something?

411
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,910
How are you so confident about this?

412
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,279
I just...

413
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:27,720
- I just know.
- Not that again.

414
00:27:27,849 --> 00:27:30,549
Did you have a look inside
a psychopath's head?

(Notary Office, 5th floor)

416
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,180
I heard that you were released.

417
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,710
I owe it to you, of course.

418
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,710
I'm very grateful.

419
00:27:56,849 --> 00:27:58,150
Don't say that.

420
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,119
I dropped your case
as soon as I heard what you'd done.

421
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:05,690
If you'd stayed on my case,
I could've gotten out sooner.

422
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:09,859
Why did you come to see me?

423
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:12,730
That girl.

424
00:28:13,529 --> 00:28:15,900
Do you know where she is now?

425
00:28:16,299 --> 00:28:17,430
What girl?

426
00:28:18,769 --> 00:28:21,299
- Are you...
- Don't get me wrong.

427
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,140
I want to kneel in front of her
and ask for forgiveness,

428
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:27,579
but my lawyer
refuses to tell me where she is.

429
00:28:28,009 --> 00:28:31,279
- I really want to apologize.
- I don't know.

430
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:34,349
I destroyed all the files
as soon as I resigned as your lawyer.

431
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,819
Even if I knew where she lives,
I can't tell you.

432
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:39,019
Too bad, then.

433
00:28:41,589 --> 00:28:43,390
With this on my leg,

434
00:28:43,859 --> 00:28:45,630
I can't go looking for her.

435
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:47,200
Unfortunately,

436
00:28:48,029 --> 00:28:50,130
I must stop looking for her.

Yes, sir.

Did you test the dog hair
on Kim Young Hee's hairband?

442
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,059
Yes. It's not from one dog but two.

443
00:29:14,089 --> 00:29:15,359
Two dogs?

444
00:29:16,859 --> 00:29:17,930
Okay.

- Officer Jung.
- Yes?

- He could tie you down.
- I would love that.

not Officer Jung now?

(March 8, 78W 8462, Woo Hyeong Cheol)

476
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:02,430
- Call me any time.
- Okay.

477
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:03,799
Get home safely.

478
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:05,539
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

479
00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:09,009
Hello. Come in.

480
00:31:15,579 --> 00:31:18,279
- Take a seat.
- Excuse me. Who was that?

481
00:31:19,019 --> 00:31:22,220
Mr. Woo consults
runaway teenagers for free.

482
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:25,960
You have a beautiful wife.

483
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:35,099
Do you go out to have fun
without your wife, then?

484
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:38,940
I didn't know you're a detective.

485
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,769
What is this about?

486
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:45,309
On March 8, you borrowed a car
to do some volunteer work.

487
00:31:45,509 --> 00:31:46,980
Where did you go?

488
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:50,009
He put up some window guards for me.

489
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:52,920
He's a lawyer who's often on TV,

490
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:54,079
so I remember him clearly.

491
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:57,690
Mu Chi. I checked them all
and they have alibis.

492
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,720
- Are you sure?
- What did I tell you?

493
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:00,990
Officer Jung's still sick.

494
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:03,289
You're saying that
Woo Hyeong Cheol's alibi is airtight.

495
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:05,089
Why didn't you listen to me?

496
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:09,299
Check Kim Baek Gi and
Jeong Man Ho's alibis for those days.

497
00:32:10,569 --> 00:32:13,500
Detective. Woo Hyeong Cheol's the killer.

498
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:14,740
As if he is.

499
00:32:15,539 --> 00:32:17,539
You got lucky once and I trusted you.

500
00:32:18,009 --> 00:32:21,140
Call all the people who asked for
window guards to be put in.

501
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:24,009
There might be more victims
other than Kang, Hong, and Kim.

502
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:27,819
(Notary Office, 5th floor)

503
00:32:27,849 --> 00:32:28,990
I'll call them.

504
00:32:34,289 --> 00:32:36,890
- Did you look up this guy?
- Yes.

505
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:41,359
He has slit eyes and a scar on his cheek.

506
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:50,009
What do you have?

507
00:32:50,309 --> 00:32:52,079
I was about to call you.

508
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,509
The hairs you got from the dog house.

509
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,180
It's different from the kind
found on Kim Young Hee hairband.

510
00:32:57,509 --> 00:33:00,220
Darn it. He got everything wrong.

511
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,750
Thanks.

512
00:33:04,789 --> 00:33:06,589
Hello? Mu Chi.

513
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:10,589
Around Hong Na Ri's time of death,
Jeong Man Ho's phone...

514
00:33:11,059 --> 00:33:12,559
pinged off a cell tower near her place.

515
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,400
Jeong Man Ho?

516
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:16,630
It really wasn't me.

517
00:33:17,299 --> 00:33:19,970
Why were you in the area
when Hong Na Ri was killed?

518
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,440
A friend owns a woodworking shop nearby.

519
00:33:22,539 --> 00:33:24,509
For a close friend's birthday present,

520
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:27,109
I wanted to make a toolbox,
so I went there.

521
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,440
Can someone confirm that?

522
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:31,549
The woodworking shop was closed that day.

523
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:33,519
You happened to be all alone that day.

524
00:33:33,549 --> 00:33:35,589
This is insane.

525
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,960
That's right. I took a photo of
the completed toolbox...

526
00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:40,220
and sent it to my friend.

527
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:41,720
Show me that photo.

528
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,329
I deleted it.

529
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:49,869
Your phone's memory
just happened to be full.

530
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,569
I'm telling the truth.

531
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:55,269
What's that thing called?
Do the forensic thing on my phone.

532
00:33:55,339 --> 00:33:56,869
Give me your friend's number.

533
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:59,210
- He must have the photo you sent.
- Right.

534
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:02,809
Do I have Jae Pil
saved as Hyeong Cheol's dad?

535
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:07,619
Jae Pil? Do you mean Woo Jae Pil?

536
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,489
What? Do you know him?

537
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:11,119
That's right.

538
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:14,489
He used to be
a serious crimes detective in Guryeong.

539
00:34:15,059 --> 00:34:16,059
(Detective Woo Jae Pil)

540
00:34:21,329 --> 00:34:22,429
He's not picking up.

541
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:26,739
Is anyone home?

542
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,550
Is anyone home?

543
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:49,329
Is anyone home?

544
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,239
Hi. Put Jeong Man Ho on.

545
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,699
- It's for you.
- Okay.

546
00:35:36,539 --> 00:35:37,639
Aren't I right?

547
00:35:37,769 --> 00:35:40,610
Jae Pil has the photo I sent, right?

548
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:43,050
Did Woo Jae Pil volunteer to...

549
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:45,110
put up window guards as well?

550
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,449
He wasn't on the list.

551
00:35:46,579 --> 00:35:47,880
No.

552
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:50,719
He did accompany Hyeong Cheol
when he was free,

553
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:52,489
but he's not a proper volunteer.

554
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:54,420
He accompanied him?

555
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:59,460
Who took the photo you posed for
outside Setbyeol Villa?

556
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:03,269
Jae Pil did. He was
the designated photographer.

557
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:06,440
1, 2, 3.

558
00:36:06,699 --> 00:36:08,039
That's lovely.

559
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:09,510
Shall we take one standing up?

561
00:36:10,869 --> 00:36:12,980
It was the father, not the son.

562
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:28,059
You're saying nothing strange happened?

563
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:30,630
Did you see anyone suspicious?

564
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,829
Okay. Thank you.

I've been looking everywhere for you.

I had no idea
you were in that neighborhood.

Where did this patient go?

Does the girl live in your neighborhood?

Of course not. She moved out
a long time ago.

632
00:47:21,639 --> 00:47:22,909
Would she have wanted to live here?

633
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:27,050
You could've just told me so.
Why would you yell at me?

634
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:29,920
Mom, shall I...

635
00:47:30,619 --> 00:47:31,949
visit you soon?

636
00:47:31,989 --> 00:47:33,219
Why would you come here?

637
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,389
Please let me live a quiet life now.

638
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:38,590
I'll pack some food
and go to see you, okay?

00:47:39,289 --> 00:47:43,429
Never come to this neighborhood.
Do you hear me?

640
00:47:49,809 --> 00:47:51,409
(Police)

641
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:59,349
Something's fishy about this old bag.

642
00:48:07,159 --> 00:48:08,289
Mr. Kim.

643
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:11,829
Tomorrow is your day off, right?

644
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:12,929
Yes.

645
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:16,199
Hey... Can you help me out?

646
00:48:20,969 --> 00:48:22,099
Did you tell him?

647
00:48:27,639 --> 00:48:30,150
Why are you guys standing here
looking all antsy?

648
00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:33,079
Hyeon Soo's killer has been caught.

649
00:48:42,690 --> 00:48:43,860
What did you just say?

650
00:48:44,789 --> 00:48:47,199
Well... The thing is...

651
00:49:04,809 --> 00:49:05,909
Jae Pil.

652
00:49:07,349 --> 00:49:08,480
It's not true, right?

653
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:13,889
My daughter Hyeon Soo...
It doesn't make sense.

654
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:17,429
It's true. I killed her.

655
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,599
Don't be ridiculous.

656
00:49:21,829 --> 00:49:22,900
It was...

657
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:25,670
Han Seo Joon who kidnapped her.

658
00:49:25,699 --> 00:49:27,369
During the search in Guryeong Mountain,

659
00:49:27,969 --> 00:49:30,570
actually, I found Hyeon Soo.

660
00:49:31,710 --> 00:49:35,280
Maybe she had run away.
She was sleeping curled up in the woods.

661
00:49:36,909 --> 00:49:38,110
What... What did you do?

662
00:49:39,110 --> 00:49:41,420
You always had
a better performance than me.

663
00:49:41,949 --> 00:49:44,889
And you acted like you were better
than me. So I hated you.

664
00:49:45,389 --> 00:49:48,960
To be honest, when I heard
that Han Seo Joon kidnapped your kids,

665
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,989
I thought you got what you deserved.

666
00:49:51,789 --> 00:49:54,329
I watched you crying
when Hyeon Seok was found...

667
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:57,369
and being unable to do your job
because of Hyeon Soo.

668
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:58,769
I liked watching you like that.

669
00:49:59,199 --> 00:50:01,300
But Hyeon Soo came back alive.

670
00:50:01,570 --> 00:50:04,940
So I just killed her even before I knew.

671
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,039
"Even if she's found later,"

672
00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:10,050
"people will think
that Han Seo Joon killed her."

673
00:50:11,409 --> 00:50:12,880
That's what I thought.

674
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:19,989
You scumbag!

675
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:22,159
You're not even human!

676
00:50:22,989 --> 00:50:25,760
Die. Just die, you scum!

677
00:50:25,789 --> 00:50:27,199
Die! Die!

678
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:29,730
Die!

679
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,099
You scum!

680
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:39,039
- Hands off!
- Let go!

681
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:47,750
I hope you fall into the fiery pit,
you scum.

682
00:51:50,679 --> 00:51:51,909
Why did you lie to him?

683
00:51:55,079 --> 00:51:58,250
You didn't kill Park Hyeon Soo.

684
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:07,599
No way.

685
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:13,639
Are you...

686
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,909
It's been found that the killer
of a detective's child...

687
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:26,579
wasn't Han Seo Joon,
but his fellow detective,

688
00:52:26,619 --> 00:52:28,179
which shocked the whole country.

689
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:29,989
According to...

690
00:53:07,719 --> 00:53:11,230
That old bag lied to me.

691
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,429
- Hey, Bong Yi.
- Ba Reum.

692
00:53:16,570 --> 00:53:18,769
You didn't forget about our plans
later in the evening, right?

693
00:53:18,829 --> 00:53:21,670
Of course not. I'll see you
at the movie theater at 6pm.

694
00:53:21,739 --> 00:53:23,610
Okay. Oh, right.

695
00:53:24,010 --> 00:53:25,969
I have a favor to ask of you.

696
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:27,110
Go ahead. What is it?

697
00:53:27,179 --> 00:53:30,750
My grandma was wearing
the brooch I made for her.

698
00:53:30,909 --> 00:53:32,409
And I haven't received it yet.

699
00:53:32,449 --> 00:53:33,550
Detective Go.

700
00:53:43,829 --> 00:53:44,829
(Evidence Storage Room)

701
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:50,900
(Restricted Area)

702
00:53:57,239 --> 00:53:58,409
2019...

703
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:02,139
Where is it?

704
00:54:10,590 --> 00:54:11,849
(Mujin Serial Murders)

705
00:54:20,730 --> 00:54:21,800
It's not in here.

706
00:54:22,329 --> 00:54:23,429
Let's check the other box.

707
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:40,219
This man...

708
00:54:47,019 --> 00:54:48,159
What was that?

709
00:54:48,489 --> 00:54:51,059
Why is the man killed by Sung Yo Han
in my memory?

710
00:54:52,389 --> 00:54:53,760
Hey, what are you doing there?

711
00:54:54,630 --> 00:54:56,130
Wait. How did you get in here?

712
00:55:31,969 --> 00:55:33,269
It's my baby's.

713
00:55:33,539 --> 00:55:36,599
It's my baby's.
Give it back. I want it back.

714
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:40,210
Give it back!

715
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:42,579
It's my baby's. Give it back.

716
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:44,280
Why are you asking about Song Soo Ho?

717
00:55:44,809 --> 00:55:46,250
Out of curiosity.

718
00:55:54,789 --> 00:55:56,090
He was burned.

719
00:55:57,829 --> 00:55:59,090
Was he beaten up...

720
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:02,199
You wouldn't know if he was burned.

721
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:05,099
No. He had every fracture possible.

722
00:56:05,329 --> 00:56:07,539
It was so bad,
his cartilage had fallen off.

723
00:56:07,969 --> 00:56:09,940
I bet he was beaten to within
an inch of his life.

724
00:56:17,349 --> 00:56:18,380
When did she leave?

725
00:56:18,449 --> 00:56:20,579
I was in the kitchen cooking and...

726
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:24,889
25 years ago, Guryeong was shaken...

727
00:56:24,949 --> 00:56:28,559
by the serial murders of
Headhunter Han Seo Joon.

728
00:56:28,590 --> 00:56:31,260
The then detective's daughter
was assumed to be his victim...

729
00:56:31,329 --> 00:56:34,460
- Ma'am. Are you all right?
- but another suspect surfaced.

730
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:36,800
- Where do you live?
- The actual killer is...

731
00:56:36,869 --> 00:56:38,900
in hospital due to poor health.

732
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:40,869
What's happening?

733
00:56:41,469 --> 00:56:44,340
Why do I have memories of people
that Sung Yo Han killed?

734
00:56:44,539 --> 00:56:46,809
Before you were attacked,

735
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,840
you must have read
his victims' files extensively.

736
00:56:49,909 --> 00:56:51,079
I would have.

737
00:56:51,150 --> 00:56:53,519
I heard I worked the case
with Detective Go.

738
00:56:53,579 --> 00:56:55,849
The contents of the case files
and photos you saw then...

739
00:56:56,349 --> 00:56:58,650
became embedded and
you mistook them for your memory.

740
00:57:00,719 --> 00:57:01,789
Don't worry.

741
00:57:02,090 --> 00:57:05,090
Soon, your real memories
and what you saw in the files...

742
00:57:05,159 --> 00:57:06,289
will separate.

743
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:08,030
Okay.

744
00:57:10,469 --> 00:57:11,500
Is that possible...

745
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:13,800
with memories from my childhood?

746
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:15,940
Kindergarten memories, for example.

747
00:57:16,269 --> 00:57:17,340
Of course.

748
00:57:17,409 --> 00:57:20,679
Things you read or saw in a movie
can be mistaken for reality.

749
00:57:24,909 --> 00:57:26,280
I see.

750
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:28,780
Are you taking your medication?

751
00:57:29,150 --> 00:57:30,190
Yes, of course.

752
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:32,619
Okay, then. Let's try another medicine.

753
00:57:32,690 --> 00:57:34,360
- Your prescription's ready.
- Thanks.

754
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:36,929
Take it three times a day,
30 minutes after each meal.

755
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:39,030
- Okay, thank you.
- Thank you.

756
00:57:44,969 --> 00:57:47,269
I saw pills just like this somewhere.

757
00:57:48,039 --> 00:57:51,110
Suspect A who is currently hospitalized
will be transported...

758
00:57:51,170 --> 00:57:53,369
by police tomorrow morning
for questioning.

759
00:57:53,579 --> 00:57:55,579
- It's now or never.
- Before then,

760
00:57:55,639 --> 00:57:57,150
complaints from the public...

761
00:57:57,210 --> 00:58:00,219
Detective. Sung Yo Han's victim
Cho Mi Jeong.

762
00:58:00,349 --> 00:58:01,849
Can I see the evidence from her case?

763
00:58:13,530 --> 00:58:16,699
They're her anorexia pills.
We found them in a drawer.

764
00:58:16,929 --> 00:58:20,070
Hello, ma'am. I'm Officer Jung Ba Reum.

765
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:23,139
I was going through the files
and had a question.

766
00:58:25,610 --> 00:58:27,340
Did your daughter...

767
00:58:27,539 --> 00:58:30,449
ever have brain surgery?

768
00:58:31,079 --> 00:58:32,210
She did.

769
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:36,079
Two years ago, she fell from a bike
and hurt her head badly.

770
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:38,119
Did she?

771
00:58:38,519 --> 00:58:41,889
Do you know the name of the doctor
who operated on her?

772
00:58:43,889 --> 00:58:45,460
Doctor Park Min Joon?

773
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:48,429
That's right. It wasn't anorexia.

774
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:49,800
It's a side-effect of brain trauma.

775
00:58:50,730 --> 00:58:53,800
She hurt the base of
the frontal lobe in the fall,

776
00:58:54,269 --> 00:58:55,440
and lost her sense of smell.

777
00:58:55,639 --> 00:58:57,570
That's why she lost so much weight.

778
00:58:58,469 --> 00:59:01,110
Sung Yo Han mistook it for anorexia.

779
00:59:01,739 --> 00:59:04,280
I felt so bad for her
when I saw it on the news.

780
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:09,280
Contrary to her condition,
can a brain injury...

781
00:59:09,619 --> 00:59:12,119
result in gaining a sense of smell
that one didn't have?

782
00:59:13,090 --> 00:59:14,159
Why do you ask?

783
00:59:16,190 --> 00:59:18,559
I was told that before my surgery,

784
00:59:18,630 --> 00:59:20,400
I loved cheonggukjang.

785
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:22,730
Now I can't even stand the smell.

786
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:26,329
Is that an after-effect
of my brain surgery?

787
00:59:27,039 --> 00:59:28,070
It's not.

788
00:59:28,139 --> 00:59:31,840
A brain injury can't bring upon
a sense of smell you didn't have.

789
00:59:33,409 --> 00:59:36,780
But there is one way.

790
00:59:37,510 --> 00:59:38,679
What is that?

791
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:43,320
Thank you, doctor. I'll see you again.

792
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:46,190
Ba Reum.

793
00:59:46,519 --> 00:59:48,690
Bong Yi. What are you doing here?

794
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:51,489
The doctor wanted to see my injury.

795
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:54,460
- What about you?
- I was over there.

796
00:59:54,530 --> 00:59:56,659
I came to see the doctor
who operated on me.

797
00:59:59,269 --> 01:00:01,900
He operated on you?

798
01:00:02,070 --> 01:00:03,940
- Yes.
- That's not him.

799
01:00:05,039 --> 01:00:06,110
That is him.

800
01:00:06,409 --> 01:00:09,239
It's not. Your doctor...

801
01:00:09,309 --> 01:00:11,750
was slightly older.

802
01:00:12,550 --> 01:00:13,719
What?

803
01:00:15,719 --> 01:00:17,019
How do you know that?

804
01:00:19,849 --> 01:00:20,960
Well...

805
01:00:47,679 --> 01:00:49,849
If he made it through this,

806
01:00:50,219 --> 01:00:52,050
he's very determined to live.

807
01:00:52,519 --> 01:00:54,320
It's a pity, but we have no choice.

808
01:00:54,489 --> 01:00:56,719
Anyway, Jung Ba Reum's surgery...

809
01:00:57,260 --> 01:00:58,789
must be a success.

(Mujin University Hospital,
Staff of Neurosurgery)

811
01:01:02,730 --> 01:01:04,570
That's odd. He's not here.

812
01:01:04,829 --> 01:01:05,900
Is he not?

813
01:01:06,699 --> 01:01:07,940
(Staff of Neurosurgery)

814
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,210
These are all the neurosurgeons
at this hospital.

815
01:01:11,469 --> 01:01:12,670
Hello.

816
01:01:13,070 --> 01:01:14,880
This lady seems to be lost.

817
01:01:15,510 --> 01:01:17,079
She might be a patient here.

818
01:01:23,019 --> 01:01:24,050
Hello?

819
01:01:25,050 --> 01:01:27,320
Yes. Where is she now?

820
01:01:28,389 --> 01:01:29,460
At Mujin Hospital?

821
01:01:34,130 --> 01:01:35,900
- Doctor.
- What now?

822
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:37,500
Well...

823
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:42,670
You operated on me, didn't you?

824
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:45,269
Yes, of course.

825
01:01:46,039 --> 01:01:48,780
Why would you suddenly ask me that?

826
01:01:50,449 --> 01:01:52,409
I was wondering if...

827
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:54,750
you worked with someone else.

828
01:01:54,820 --> 01:01:56,719
Of course, I did it all myself.

829
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:59,849
Not to brag,
but when it comes to my skill,

830
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:03,260
I'm considered one of the best
brain surgeons in the country.

831
01:02:03,659 --> 01:02:05,260
I'm proud and confident of that fact too.

832
01:02:06,690 --> 01:02:09,130
Okay. I apologize, doctor.

833
01:02:10,530 --> 01:02:13,030
- Goodbye. Take care.
- Bye.

834
01:02:24,010 --> 01:02:25,409
He's lying.

835
01:02:31,590 --> 01:02:33,389
I think Jung Ba Reum suspects something.

836
01:02:52,409 --> 01:02:54,340
Why is he lying?

837
01:02:56,679 --> 01:02:57,849
What for?

838
01:02:59,610 --> 01:03:01,320
Why would he lie?

839
01:03:15,699 --> 01:03:17,699
Code Red, Code Red.

840
01:03:17,769 --> 01:03:20,329
Mujin Hospital, first floor.
An armed man is causing a commotion.

841
01:03:20,539 --> 01:03:22,900
Any officer inside, come and assist.

842
01:03:22,969 --> 01:03:25,510
(Mujin University Hospital)

843
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:31,349
Wait, Han Seo Joon.

844
01:03:32,409 --> 01:03:34,550
I'll kill Woo Jae Pil
and then I'm coming for you.

845
01:03:45,690 --> 01:03:47,630
Go Mu Chi, what are you doing here?

846
01:04:15,289 --> 01:04:16,559
That's not him.

847
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:20,559
That doctor had a scar on his face.

848
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:22,699
On this side, and it was long.

849
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:23,929
A scar?

850
01:04:32,269 --> 01:04:34,380
What did he do to the mouse's head?

851
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:36,940
He used to be a famous neurosurgeon.

852
01:04:40,150 --> 01:04:41,579
It can't be.

853
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:43,579
He was in prison.

854
01:04:48,219 --> 01:04:51,030
Why does he have to be a neurosurgeon?

855
01:05:01,539 --> 01:05:02,699
Hi, Officer Kim.

856
01:05:04,269 --> 01:05:06,139
Yes, I'm fine.

857
01:05:06,769 --> 01:05:10,809
Can I get a recent photo of Han Seo Joon?

858
01:05:11,179 --> 01:05:13,550
I'm not allowed to give out
photos of inmates.

859
01:05:14,650 --> 01:05:17,179
A documentary team interviewed him.

860
01:05:17,449 --> 01:05:18,590
You can watch that.

861
01:05:19,489 --> 01:05:20,519
Oh, right.

862
01:05:32,099 --> 01:05:33,130
Wait.

863
01:05:33,699 --> 01:05:34,840
I'll tell them that I did it.

864
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:38,469
Please let me go to that scumbag,
Han Seo Joon.

865
01:05:38,809 --> 01:05:40,440
I'll avenge your kids.

866
01:05:40,909 --> 01:05:43,579
I'll take revenge on him on behalf
of his victims and their families.

867
01:05:44,349 --> 01:05:45,409
Okay?

868
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:54,860
I killed him. Arrest me.

869
01:05:55,460 --> 01:05:56,519
He's dead.

870
01:05:57,190 --> 01:05:58,289
Come on.

871
01:05:58,829 --> 01:05:59,960
Arrest him.

872
01:06:00,389 --> 01:06:01,659
(Police)

873
01:06:08,969 --> 01:06:10,539
He didn't do it.

874
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:12,940
He didn't.

875
01:06:14,639 --> 01:06:16,110
He didn't.

876
01:06:17,010 --> 01:06:18,280
He didn't.

877
01:06:18,349 --> 01:06:19,409
Mu Chi...

878
01:06:21,019 --> 01:06:23,449
is going to take revenge...

879
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:25,789
on our kids' murderer.

880
01:06:27,250 --> 01:06:29,489
I know this is terrible of me to say.

881
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:37,260
But let's just feign ignorance.

882
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:40,630
We didn't see anything.

883
01:06:41,969 --> 01:06:43,239
Let's turn a blind eye.

884
01:06:49,610 --> 01:06:50,909
Han Seo Joon's interview?

885
01:06:50,949 --> 01:06:52,079
Yes.

886
01:06:53,250 --> 01:06:56,179
I saw the documentary and noticed
that only his interview...

887
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:58,489
- was cropped out.
- Well...

888
01:06:59,519 --> 01:07:01,719
After it was aired, the bereaved families
were too against it,

889
01:07:01,820 --> 01:07:03,789
so we had to crop it out.

890
01:07:05,030 --> 01:07:06,090
But what's this about?

891
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:10,429
I was just curious.

892
01:07:12,099 --> 01:07:15,469
I'm just curious as to why Detective Go...

893
01:07:15,940 --> 01:07:17,139
was so enraged.

894
01:07:19,170 --> 01:07:20,639
- I'll look for it.
- Okay.

895
01:07:37,429 --> 01:07:40,429
Bong Yi, I just sent you a photo.

896
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:42,929
Can you check if it was him?

897
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:44,900
- A photo?
- It's a screenshot of footage,

898
01:07:44,929 --> 01:07:46,000
so it's a bit blurry.

899
01:07:46,199 --> 01:07:47,300
But take a close look.

900
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:05,389
You've grown up so beautifully,

901
01:08:06,289 --> 01:08:07,519
my baby.

902
01:08:09,889 --> 01:08:12,690
Yes, it's him.
He's the one who operated on you.

903
01:08:27,109 --> 01:08:28,640
What have you done...

904
01:08:29,739 --> 01:08:30,810
to my head?

905
01:08:34,819 --> 01:08:36,619
What did you put in here?

906
01:08:44,020 --> 01:08:45,430
Did you...

907
01:08:47,229 --> 01:08:50,460
implant that murderer
Sung Yo Han's brain in here?

908
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:53,569
Did you?
