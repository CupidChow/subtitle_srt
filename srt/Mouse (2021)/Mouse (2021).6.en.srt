Our Lord...

the Savior...

11
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:52,789
will...

12
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:55,789
save you.

13
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:16,510
Well?

14
00:01:17,019 --> 00:01:18,250
What do you think?

15
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:22,019
I asked you not to make me a monster.

16
00:01:22,989 --> 00:01:24,189
I begged.

17
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:28,689
But you disregarded my prayers.

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,230
What kind of a deity does that make you?

19
00:01:34,099 --> 00:01:35,769
Now I'm the deity.

20
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:39,400
Everyone who believes
the nonsense you teach.

21
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,409
I will judge them all.

22
00:01:54,049 --> 00:02:00,019
(I am the deity.)

(Episode 6)

25
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:53,280
Fa... Father Go.

26
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,490
Over here!

27
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,600
They're coming out.

28
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,470
It's a girl.

29
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:38,980
(911 Emergency)

30
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:53,860
Excuse me. Moving through.

31
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:55,060
Excuse me.

32
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,529
Mint.

33
00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:07,269
Excuse me.

34
00:06:16,579 --> 00:06:20,550
He already knew we'd rush over
to the Yirye-dong Church.

35
00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:31,730
(I am the deity.)

36
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,899
I think that this guy is no human being.

37
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:38,970
He's a monster.

38
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,639
You might lose
what's most important to you.

39
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,009
What's most important to me?

40
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,339
(I am the deity.)

41
00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:47,449
I lost it all when I was eight.

42
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:49,579
You saw it.

43
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,790
I have nothing more to lose.

44
00:06:55,389 --> 00:06:57,360
Mu Won.

45
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:01,829
- Mu Won.
- Hey, Mu Chi.

46
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:03,459
Hey, come here.

47
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,899
Mu Chi!

48
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:08,300
Come here.

49
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:11,970
Mu Won.

50
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,069
Come here.

51
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,209
Mu Chi.

52
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:44,439
We've just received the footage
from the killer.

53
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,800
Kim Han Guk can be seen...

54
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:49,069
in the three-minute-long footage.

55
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,910
After an urgent discussion,

56
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:54,379
we have decided to air this footage.

57
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:57,980
"When the farmer only fed
the donkey delicious food,"

58
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:00,019
"the goat became jealous."

59
00:08:01,149 --> 00:08:02,990
That boy took your place.

60
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,120
What do you think? Don't you hate him?

61
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:09,730
Don't you want him gone?

62
00:08:10,899 --> 00:08:12,000
Say it.

63
00:08:12,629 --> 00:08:14,600
Admit that you're jealous of him.

64
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:21,709
I brought him here
since you wouldn't give me an answer.

65
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,509
How does it feel to see him in person?

66
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:28,449
A good boy doesn't lie.

67
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,779
Just say the word,
and I'll get rid of him.

68
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,620
I'm not jealous of him.

69
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:38,620
So please send him back home now.

70
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,259
Those who do not envy
or get jealous are sinners.

71
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,799
I...

72
00:08:49,169 --> 00:08:50,970
pity you.

73
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:59,440
"The goat schemed a plan
so that the farmer..."

74
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,950
"would dislike the donkey."

75
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:04,250
"The goat whispered to the donkey."

76
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:08,120
"'Isn't it tiring to work all day long?'"

77
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:10,820
"'Pretend like you're sick and collapse.'"

78
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:13,419
"'If you do that, you'll be able
to rest in peace.'"

79
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:18,230
"The donkey did exactly that
and collapsed on the ground."

80
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:20,870
"While collapsing,
it bruised its entire body."

81
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,539
We found this piece of bread
where Han Guk went missing.

82
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,509
"Hansel and Gretel".

83
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:31,210
The wrath toward the witch
who ate children.

84
00:09:31,309 --> 00:09:34,210
The wrath toward his dad
who didn't look for him. The wrath.

85
00:09:34,409 --> 00:09:38,179
"Worried, the farmer went to the vet
and asked for a remedy."

86
00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:40,220
"The vet replied."

87
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:43,019
"Decoct the lungs of a goat."

88
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,519
"Then the donkey will regain its energy."

89
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,129
Goatman, make your choice.

90
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:51,759
If you want to live,
you must kill that donkey.

91
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:52,759
("The Donkey and the Goat")

92
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:56,370
If the donkey doesn't die, the goat will.

93
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:59,639
The reason why the kidnapper wants
to kill Han Guk is because...

94
00:09:59,669 --> 00:10:02,669
unlike the goat in the fairy tale,
"The Donkey and the Goat",

95
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:05,039
Han Guk is neither envious nor jealous.

96
00:10:05,309 --> 00:10:08,080
Meanwhile, we have confirmed...

97
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:11,450
that the other boy who was kidnapped
alongside Han Guk...

98
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,879
has returned home safely.

99
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:16,220
Experts have cautiously speculated...

100
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,690
that there is a low chance...

101
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,090
that Han Guk is still alive.

102
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:34,210
Where's Detective Go?

103
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:50,450
They injected
sedatives against his will...

104
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:52,220
and finally managed to bring him here.

105
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:26,059
It's time for us
to say our last farewell...

106
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:27,990
to Father Go Mu Won Marcellino.

107
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:30,799
To my beloved citizens.

108
00:11:30,929 --> 00:11:34,830
With a heavy heart, I am here today.

109
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:39,139
An innocent man was gruesomely murdered...

110
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,809
on camera.

111
00:11:42,509 --> 00:11:45,080
We would like to sincerely apologize...

112
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:48,110
to our citizens...

113
00:11:48,149 --> 00:11:50,950
who are still shocked and horrified.

114
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:55,590
In order to prevent any more lives
from being sacrificed,

115
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,690
we will focus on this case...

116
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,029
and do our best to apprehend
the killer as soon as possible.

117
00:12:02,059 --> 00:12:05,529
They've just found a body
that's presumably Professor Lee's.

118
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:08,070
Once again, I would like to tell...

119
00:12:08,169 --> 00:12:10,129
- Are you sure?
- You see,

120
00:12:10,269 --> 00:12:12,870
the body is badly decomposed
from having been underwater for so long.

121
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,870
In order to prevent
such tragic deaths from occurring again,

122
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,409
we promise to come up...

123
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,509
with a countermeasure
for violent crimes...

124
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:24,009
so that our citizens
will be able to live...

125
00:12:24,379 --> 00:12:26,980
in a crime-free society.

126
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:30,549
We pray that You'll show mercy on him
and allow him to rest in peace.

127
00:12:31,659 --> 00:12:32,720
Amen.

128
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:35,460
(Go Mu Won)

129
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,269
Detective Go.

130
00:12:44,539 --> 00:12:47,509
Open up. How long are you going
to keep this up for?

131
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:49,370
You'll starve to death at this rate.

132
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:51,879
Please open up.

133
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:54,279
Please, Detective Go.

134
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:57,620
At least show me your face.

135
00:13:05,019 --> 00:13:06,059
Yes?

136
00:13:08,129 --> 00:13:09,230
She's awake?

137
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,629
Neither your cornea
nor the nerve roots in your hand...

138
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:16,629
are seriously injured, so you'll be okay.

139
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:19,399
Did they...

140
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:21,909
catch him?

141
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,509
No.

142
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:30,980
Did you...

143
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,580
see his face?

144
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:37,690
I'm so stupid.

145
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:41,129
I should've checked his face first.

146
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,929
Then he would've killed you.

147
00:13:46,529 --> 00:13:49,330
Wait. Doctor.

148
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:53,870
Haven't we...

149
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,240
met?

150
00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:02,649
Bong Yi.

151
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:05,320
Hey, are you okay?

152
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,549
Yes.

153
00:14:08,649 --> 00:14:11,120
How could you be so foolishly fearless
and go there by yourself?

154
00:14:11,259 --> 00:14:13,190
The man who killed my grandma was there.

155
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,629
Still, you shouldn't have gone alone.

156
00:14:14,659 --> 00:14:15,830
Did you think
your trivial martial arts skills...

157
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,230
would've worked on him?

158
00:14:17,259 --> 00:14:19,299
- Is he a joke to you?
- Then what?

159
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:22,830
Should I have sit still
when he was about to kill Father Go?

160
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,399
Should I have done that?

161
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:27,440
If Grandma saw you right now,
she would be very...

162
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,210
What about Detective Go?

163
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,710
How is he?

164
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,480
How do you know him?

165
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:40,450
Are you okay?

166
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,419
Hello.

167
00:14:45,789 --> 00:14:47,059
Had we been a few seconds late,

168
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:48,590
It could've been much worse.

169
00:14:49,129 --> 00:14:51,529
We all were headed to Yirye-dong Church.

170
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,269
How did you know he was at Gudong Church?

171
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,899
Take me to Yirye-dong Church, quick.

172
00:14:58,539 --> 00:15:01,409
I was also heading to
Yirye-dong Church at first.

173
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:05,080
Grandma, I'm on my way to kill that scum.

174
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:10,809
I saw the same candlesticks
as the ones in my grandma's photo.

175
00:15:11,019 --> 00:15:12,779
The candlesticks in Gudong Church.

176
00:15:14,049 --> 00:15:17,019
Sir, please take me to Gudong Church.
Hurry up, please.

177
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,559
You should've called the police first.

178
00:15:18,789 --> 00:15:19,889
I did.

179
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,830
But the officer said that candlesticks
at every church look the same.

180
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:26,200
At least we were able to save you
because you reported it.

181
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:30,570
Did you see anything?

182
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:34,240
It was too dark.

183
00:15:35,669 --> 00:15:38,340
And I got candle wax in my eye.

184
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:42,450
So... you didn't see anything?

185
00:15:47,149 --> 00:15:48,289
By the way,

186
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:50,919
he was really strong.

187
00:15:51,289 --> 00:15:53,860
What else? Do you remember anything else?

188
00:15:54,289 --> 00:15:55,429
Anything would do.

189
00:15:58,899 --> 00:16:00,429
He wasn't left-handed.

190
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,370
Wait. He wasn't left-handed?

191
00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:08,610
That's odd. The man who attacked me
was definitely left-handed.

192
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,710
And the knife we found
on the roof of the church...

193
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,980
It was stuck into it
by a lefty for sure too.

194
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,779
No, he wasn't left-handed. I'm sure of it.

195
00:16:21,419 --> 00:16:23,389
Can you think of anything else?

196
00:16:26,659 --> 00:16:27,960
Well...

197
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,360
Give me some more time.

198
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:37,370
Sure. Let us know
if you remember anything.

199
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,470
Goodbye.

200
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:46,710
I'll go and check in on Chi Gook
since we're here.

201
00:16:54,049 --> 00:16:57,049
The person you have reached is not
available. Please leave a message.

202
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:00,889
Yo Han, I came to the hospital
to see you...

203
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,029
since I came to Mujin,
but you didn't pick up.

204
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,849
That must hurt.

205
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:33,519
How could he do this to a kid?

206
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:35,359
Stop it.

207
00:17:36,259 --> 00:17:37,390
It doesn't hurt.

208
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:42,099
I made a promise to your grandmother.

209
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,640
A promise?

210
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,109
She asked me...

211
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:52,109
to check in on you regularly
and see if you're okay...

212
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,710
if she couldn't be with you.

213
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,809
And I promised I'd do that.

214
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:58,380
So if anything bad happens to you,

215
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:00,980
I'd be too ashamed to face her when I die.

216
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:05,789
Get some sleep.

217
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:08,259
I'll go and bring some stuff
like toiletries.

218
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:14,670
Oh, right.

219
00:18:15,829 --> 00:18:18,440
I think I cut his arm.

220
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,839
Really?

221
00:18:21,569 --> 00:18:23,970
Are you sure? Did you really do it?

222
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,309
Well...

223
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,809
While he was grabbing my hair,

224
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:32,150
I kept swinging around a knife in my hand.

225
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,920
And I felt that it touched something.

226
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,289
Where? Which arm?

227
00:18:35,349 --> 00:18:37,960
I think... I was...

228
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:41,960
Left. I'm pretty sure it was his left arm.

229
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,259
- The left arm?
- Yes.

230
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:46,400
Okay. I'll tell Detective Kang.

231
00:18:46,829 --> 00:18:47,829
Rest up.

232
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:52,700
The left arm.

233
00:19:09,019 --> 00:19:10,789
Die. Just die.

234
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:14,220
You need to die. You're a monster.

235
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,660
I should have killed him then.

236
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,099
I should've done it.

237
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:24,069
Are you all right, ma'am?

238
00:19:30,309 --> 00:19:31,440
I'm fine.

239
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,049
Who was that?

240
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,880
I don't know.
She didn't seem to be feeling well.

241
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,450
- We're running late. Let's hurry up.
- Okay.

242
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:52,130
So this fake Han Guk is
Han Guk's stepbrother?

243
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:54,400
Did you meet this kid?

244
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,299
Yes, I did. But he didn't see anything.

245
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,000
He was playing in front of his house,
and someone covered his mouth.

246
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:01,069
And when he woke up, he was back
in front of his house. That's all.

247
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:06,609
By the way, didn't he leave anything
around Father Go's body?

248
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:09,910
He left something
around all the other victims'.

249
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:14,420
Come with me.

250
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:20,859
Did Detective Go see this too?

251
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,589
He was out of it when he was there.

252
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:26,059
I really don't know how I should
tell him about this.

253
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:31,799
I didn't know at first.

254
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:33,740
But then I noticed...

255
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:36,970
that something was weird about his body.

256
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:41,950
Detective Go hasn't
snapped out of it, right?

257
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:46,019
I'm worried he might fall ill
at this rate.

258
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:52,960
- Move.
- What are you doing?

259
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:55,460
- Darn it.
- Hey.

260
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,759
- Dong Goo.
- Gosh.

261
00:20:58,059 --> 00:20:59,630
- Dong Goo.
- Quiet down.

262
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:03,000
A thought popped in my head
while I was pooping.

263
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:08,039
He knew we were making a fake video...

264
00:21:08,569 --> 00:21:10,210
and made one too.

265
00:21:10,809 --> 00:21:12,039
How did he know?

266
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:14,680
My hunch like a genius detective's
is telling me...

267
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:17,710
- that he planted a wiretap.
- A wiretap?

268
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,019
Yes.

269
00:21:23,089 --> 00:21:26,359
On second thought, the wiretap must not
still be in this house.

270
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,059
You didn't come home for days
to attend to Bong Yi.

271
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:30,559
So he must've removed it already.

272
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:34,599
But how would the killer have known
where I live?

273
00:21:34,769 --> 00:21:37,029
That's easy. By following
Detective Go and Ms. Choi,

274
00:21:37,099 --> 00:21:38,470
he could've found your house easily.

275
00:21:38,769 --> 00:21:40,039
You're right.

276
00:21:42,309 --> 00:21:44,339
Hey, did you blabber about it?

277
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:46,339
Come on. What do you take me for?

278
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,079
Could it be...

279
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:51,210
Ms. Choi?

280
00:21:51,349 --> 00:21:53,049
None of us blabbered about it.

281
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:55,549
Think about it. We decided to
push forward with the broadcast...

282
00:21:55,619 --> 00:21:59,059
and made the fake video
only an hour before the show.

283
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,990
We didn't get a chance to meet
or talk to anyone else but each other.

284
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:05,529
Could he have listened in on us
just like he said?

285
00:22:13,539 --> 00:22:16,509
It's been 10 days since Kim Han Guk went
missing at an amusement park in Mujin,

286
00:22:16,569 --> 00:22:19,339
but Han Guk is still nowhere to be found.

287
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:23,410
Based on the video that the culprit sent,
the police have been carrying out...

288
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,119
a massive search around Simjeon Station
and Han Guk's birth father's house.

289
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,519
But there has been no progress.

290
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,539
He didn't even touch it.

291
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,769
I heard that if you keep drinking alcohol
on an empty stomach,

292
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:53,180
you might die of acute alcohol poisoning.

293
00:22:54,279 --> 00:22:55,849
We should make sure he eats something
by any means.

294
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:57,609
Gosh. What should I make for him?

295
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,279
It's so kind of you.

296
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:03,549
But he wouldn't eat anything
since he has no will to live.

297
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:06,220
Come on. Even so, we should make him
eat at least one bite.

298
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:11,329
What's this?

299
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,329
- This is it!
- What?

300
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:19,640
- Great.
- What was that?

301
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,009
I'm glad I found this.

302
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:49,869
Detective Go.

303
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,670
When we gathered at my place
to prepare for the broadcast,

304
00:23:54,069 --> 00:23:56,170
you enjoyed the japchae and food.

305
00:23:57,009 --> 00:23:58,539
That wasn't my food.

306
00:23:59,809 --> 00:24:00,839
That was...

307
00:24:03,849 --> 00:24:05,720
food that Father Go had brought.

308
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:08,950
In case you wouldn't eat it,

309
00:24:09,619 --> 00:24:11,150
I told a lie.

310
00:24:12,789 --> 00:24:17,130
I asked Father Go why he'd made so much.

311
00:24:18,259 --> 00:24:20,259
He said you like japchae,

312
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:22,599
so he wanted it to last.

313
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,670
He also said because
you don't like carrots,

314
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,769
he didn't put in any.

315
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:37,049
This is the last batch of it.

316
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:43,019
You can eat it or throw it out.
It's up to you.

317
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:59,569
Father Go really wouldn't want you to...

318
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,400
be like this.

319
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:13,049
Breaking news. The killer released
another video of Kim Han Guk.

320
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:03,130
This is what happens to Goat Man.

321
00:26:03,869 --> 00:26:07,269
Detective Go. What are you doing?

322
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:10,109
Will you give up on saving Han Guk?

323
00:26:12,809 --> 00:26:14,980
If you don't find me within three days,

324
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:19,519
the whole country
will see Han Guk missing his lungs.

325
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:25,660
You have until exactly midnight
of the third day from today.

326
00:26:27,259 --> 00:26:30,190
Han Guk. Han Guk!

327
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:31,329

You didn't accept it.

was you.

You talked to each other
more than once a day.

355
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,990
Why haven't you called him in a week?

356
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:48,420
When he last called me that day,
he said he'd go traveling.

I told you I was at home then.

361
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:03,069
Exactly. You were at home
when Professor Lee vanished,

362
00:30:03,369 --> 00:30:06,809
and you were at home
when your alibi Kim Joon Sung was killed.

I'd come back from the toilet...

To play it for Chi Gook.

- What?
- It's an heirloom from his dad.

412

His dad loved that singer a lot,

413
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:43,630
so he made the recording himself
when the singer performed in Korea.

that I chose the victims randomly?

491
00:39:15,889 --> 00:39:18,460
Find out the reason why I chose
the kid on that show.

492
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:24,030
Make sure you're sober.
Take this seriously.

493
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:26,070
A person's life is on the line.

494
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:29,570
Find out the reason why I chose
the kid on that show.

495
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:33,510
If you don't say the correct answer,
I will kill the kid...

496
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:35,880
when the show ends
in front of all people in the country.

497
00:39:48,059 --> 00:39:49,260
Han Seo Joon.

498
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:52,630
That scumbag killed my parents.

499
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:57,730
Was that not enough? How dare you,
his son, kill my brother as well?

500
00:40:09,849 --> 00:40:10,949
You wait there.

501
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:14,420
I'll kill you first, go to prison,

502
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:17,250
and slice your dad's neck as well.

503
00:40:23,789 --> 00:40:25,559
If none of the outsiders are suspects,

504
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:27,800
that means the accomplice
is on the inside.

505
00:40:27,929 --> 00:40:29,300
That's absurd.

506
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,070
Right.

507
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:34,440
No one would be reckless enough
to do that in their workplace.

508
00:40:36,409 --> 00:40:38,940
First, I'd like to meet
with Officer Na's colleagues.

509
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:40,510
Sure. This way.

510
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,309
- Ms. Choi.
- Officer Jung, why are you here?

511
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,820
I came to pick up Chi Gook's belongings.

512
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,619
- I see.
- Are you investigating?

513
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:52,820
Yes. None of the outsiders
were potential suspects,

514
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,789
so I want to meet with some officers.

515
00:40:54,889 --> 00:40:56,059
I see.

516
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:59,130
What about those who didn't sign
the visitor's book?

517
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:01,960
They would be turned away
from the entrance.

518
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:03,969
What? We got a free pass.

519
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:06,969
We didn't have our IDs,
so he drove us in his car.

520
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:09,940
My car's registered here so...

521
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:12,269
Those who ride the officers' cars...

522
00:41:12,309 --> 00:41:15,039
wouldn't need to sign the visitor's book.

523
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:18,050
We do check their IDs once again
in the reception room.

524
00:41:18,449 --> 00:41:20,719
But if they enter
through the restricted door,

525
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:21,880
then that is possible.

526
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:24,119
Let's check the visitor's book once again.

527
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:34,599
How strange.

528
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,929
Someone had visited
the dispensary that day.

529
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,300
Who?

530
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:40,900
That day when Officer Na was injured...

531
00:41:40,969 --> 00:41:43,869
Officer Na is seriously injured.
Please hurry to the auditorium.

532
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:45,739
Okay, I'll be there right now.

533
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:48,579
Someone got hurt. I'll be back.

534
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:51,510
I should get going as well.
It's almost time for my shift.

535
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:53,179
I'm certain someone was there.

536
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:54,679
Where's that doctor right now?

537
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:57,619
("Mujin Detention Center Finds Out That
One of Their Prisoner is HIV Positive")

538
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:08,630
Officer!

539
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:16,409
I... I can't breathe.

540
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:20,909
I've quit this gig a long time ago.

541
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:25,110
How could a detective make
an honest man do this?

542
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:28,519
You told me never to do this again
when you caught me.

543
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:30,550
You're saving a life here.

544
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,190
- Did it work?
- Yes.

545
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,130
Good. You may go now.

546
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:31,429
It looks like a zipper.

547
00:45:31,469 --> 00:45:32,840
We found it in the Ferris wheel car.

548
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:40,780
Here.

549
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:43,250
You went in there, didn't you?

550
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,250
Where?

551
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:45,280
To find this.

552
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:47,719
I bet you took it out of his house,
threw it out here,

553
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:48,980
and called me.

554
00:45:49,019 --> 00:45:50,320
- No, I didn't.
- Don't lie to me.

555
00:45:50,389 --> 00:45:51,849
Sung Yo Han is not that stupid.

556
00:45:51,889 --> 00:45:54,119
He would never throw out
solid evidence like this.

557
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:57,590
You know it won't be accepted as evidence
if you took it out without a warrant.

558
00:45:57,989 --> 00:46:00,429
Listen. From a psychological
point of view...

559
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,130
I said I didn't find it in his house,
you punk!

560
00:46:02,659 --> 00:46:04,369
Say no more and request a warrant now.

561
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,769
Detective Go, this is...

562
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:08,969
You punk, what if Han Guk is in there?

563
00:46:09,769 --> 00:46:11,610
What if we find him after he dies?

564
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:15,139
We're running out of time.
We have only one day left.

565
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:18,150
Fine. I'll do it.

566
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:20,750
I don't know.

567
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,889
Some criminals do stupid things.

568
00:46:23,389 --> 00:46:25,449
Like throwing out something that can be
crucial evidence at a place like this.

569
00:46:25,719 --> 00:46:27,090
Maybe he wanted to be caught.

570
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:33,059
Golden Boy... I mean,
Detective Shin, thank you.

571
00:46:33,099 --> 00:46:36,170
I'll vote for your father
when he runs for President.

572
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,500
Should I thank you?

573
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:41,900
Anyway, once it's confirmed
to be Daniel Lee's blood,

574
00:46:42,539 --> 00:46:44,070
we'll get a search warrant.

575
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:48,280
Right.

576
00:46:51,849 --> 00:46:53,250
You seem fine.

577
00:46:54,519 --> 00:46:56,079
Do you know Sung Yo Han?

578
00:46:56,949 --> 00:47:00,690
Pardon? How do you know Yo Han?

579
00:47:00,889 --> 00:47:02,190
Did he come here that day?

580
00:47:03,789 --> 00:47:06,360
On the day when the new prison officer
was attacked.

581
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:10,269
How did you know that?

582
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:11,369
Doctor.

583
00:47:13,269 --> 00:47:16,340
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but you have a visitor.

584
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:17,469
Okay.

585
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:19,579
Excuse me for a moment.

586
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:29,050
Sung Ji Eun...

587
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:32,050
That daring witch.

588
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:35,659
Someone came here on the day
of Officer Na Chi Gook's accident, right?

589
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:38,760
The thing is, my friend from college
came to see me.

590
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:42,860
He insisted on coming all the way here
saying he had something to tell me.

591
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:44,969
But he forgot to bring his ID,

592
00:47:45,099 --> 00:47:47,469
So I went to pick him up.
We came together in my car.

593
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,400
Why didn't you tell the police?

594
00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:53,710
Well... I forgot.

595
00:47:54,110 --> 00:47:56,849
But there's no way that
Yo Han is the culprit.

596
00:47:58,409 --> 00:47:59,510
Who?

597
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:01,949
Oh, his name is Sung Yo Han.

598
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:06,889
Sung... Sung Yo Han? Sung Yo Han...

599
00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:09,789
Isn't Sung Yo Han the doctor
who operated on Chi Gook?

600
00:48:09,889 --> 00:48:11,960
That's him. I heard he did it.

601
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:13,230
I'm scared.

602
00:48:14,659 --> 00:48:15,760
I'm scared.

603
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:19,840
Detective Kang, we found out that someone
was missing on the visitors' list...

604
00:48:19,869 --> 00:48:21,639
on the day when Chi Gook was attacked.

605
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:39,960
Detective Shin, did you get a warrant?

606
00:48:41,059 --> 00:48:42,920
What? Not yet?

607
00:48:44,059 --> 00:48:45,289
Darn it.

608
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:47,699
Okay.

609
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,070
What is Ms. Choi doing here?

610
00:49:30,309 --> 00:49:31,340
A wiretap?

611
00:49:31,369 --> 00:49:33,280
The wiretap must not
still be in this house.

612
00:49:33,309 --> 00:49:35,840
You didn't come home for days,
so he must've removed it already.

613
00:49:43,789 --> 00:49:44,920
I guess he threw it out.

614
00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:17,719
When did you come?

615
00:50:32,699 --> 00:50:33,840
Was it him?

616
00:50:34,639 --> 00:50:35,840
Sung Yo Han is...

617
00:50:36,369 --> 00:50:37,769
What will you do when you find him?

618
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:39,539
Are you going to hurt him
instead of Han Seo Joon?

619
00:50:39,909 --> 00:50:41,539
Do you really have to find his son?

620
00:50:41,639 --> 00:50:43,079
His son hasn't done anything wrong.

621
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:46,050
She knew who Sung Yo Han was.

622
00:50:53,619 --> 00:50:56,019
Is everything okay?
You didn't say you'd come.

623
00:50:56,860 --> 00:50:59,489
No reason. I just wanted to see you.

624
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:01,530
Let's go downstairs.

625
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:03,570
Okay.

626
00:51:09,809 --> 00:51:11,369
(Human Genetic Testing Laboratory)

627
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:14,579
(Human Genetic Testing Laboratory)

628
00:51:17,309 --> 00:51:20,420
(Human Genetic Testing Laboratory)

629
00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:47,309
- Drink it.
- Thank you.

630
00:51:53,719 --> 00:51:56,280
- Will you be free tomorrow evening?
- What?

631
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:59,820
Oh, I... I'll be free.

632
00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:01,659
Why? Do you have something to say to me?

633
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:04,889
I'll tell you everything tomorrow.

634
00:52:05,590 --> 00:52:06,659
Everything?

635
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:09,659
Okay.

636
00:52:11,469 --> 00:52:12,570
Let me get this.

637
00:52:17,309 --> 00:52:18,510
Detective Go, are you all right?

638
00:52:19,610 --> 00:52:21,179
- I'm busy right now...
- We just got a search warrant...

639
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:22,510
to search the suspect's home.

640
00:52:22,909 --> 00:52:24,050
A search warrant?

641
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:28,119
- Who is the suspect?
- They'll leave in 30 minutes.

642
00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:29,420
Hurry over if you want the exclusive.

643
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:33,519
I should go now.

644
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:35,079
I'm so sorry. I just got my license.

645
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:36,349
It's okay. You can go.

646
00:53:37,289 --> 00:53:39,219
Come on. Don't be like this.

647
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:41,889
Someone said the same thing
and reported me as a hit-and-run driver.

648
00:53:42,159 --> 00:53:44,530
Wait here. I called the police.
They'll be here shortly.

649
00:53:44,630 --> 00:53:46,329
I already said it's okay.

650
00:53:58,510 --> 00:53:59,570
Hello.

651
00:53:59,710 --> 00:54:01,280
- Hi.
- I didn't pay attention...

652
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:02,809
and bumped into his car.

653
00:54:03,349 --> 00:54:05,280
I don't mind. Can I go now?

654
00:54:05,349 --> 00:54:06,480
- I have urgent business.
- Okay.

655
00:54:07,579 --> 00:54:08,719
Excuse me.

656
00:54:09,219 --> 00:54:11,519
I heard a sound from the passenger seat.

657
00:54:11,619 --> 00:54:13,360
It sounded like a child groaning.

658
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:15,920
- A child?
- I think you should check.

659
00:54:16,019 --> 00:54:17,690
Considering what's
been happening recently.

660
00:54:20,059 --> 00:54:21,300
What's that?

661
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:25,369
I'm on my way to volunteer as a doctor.

662
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:28,639
They're my clothes and medical supplies.

663
00:54:28,869 --> 00:54:30,340
Can you take them out and show us?

664
00:54:33,039 --> 00:54:36,079
Why do you want to check my suitcase
when you're here for a traffic accident?

665
00:54:36,179 --> 00:54:39,349
As you know, we're on high alert
because of a serial killer.

666
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:41,150
- Please cooperate.
- I don't want to.

667
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:45,420
If you won't, we must take you in with us.

668
00:55:10,809 --> 00:55:13,050
She knew who Sung Yo Han was.

669
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:22,719
Why won't you answer your phone?

670
00:55:23,889 --> 00:55:25,530
Sorry. It's dead.

671
00:55:26,289 --> 00:55:28,130
- Where's the warrant?
- It was denied.

672
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:29,800
Denied? Why?

673
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:32,500
The blood on his shoe
isn't Professor Lee's.

674
00:55:32,630 --> 00:55:34,139
It's not Professor Lee's?

675
00:55:34,199 --> 00:55:36,670
No. They compared it with
all the other victims',

676
00:55:36,739 --> 00:55:37,809
and it's none of theirs.

677
00:55:39,010 --> 00:55:40,380
Then whose blood is it?

678
00:55:41,679 --> 00:55:44,809
There's no time. Let's break into
the basement and get Han Guk.

679
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,679
No, no, no.

680
00:55:47,579 --> 00:55:49,719
What if Han Guk's not there
and I'm wrong again?

681
00:55:52,449 --> 00:55:54,690
I already lost my brother
by acting rashly.

682
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,789
If we sneak in and he catches on,

683
00:55:59,489 --> 00:56:01,030
he might kill Han Guk before it's time.

684
00:56:01,099 --> 00:56:03,769
Plus, if before we save Han Guk,

685
00:56:03,929 --> 00:56:05,670
he cleans up all the evidence,

686
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:08,599
even if we arrest him,
he'll manage to get out.

687
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:10,110
Then what do we do?

688
00:56:10,170 --> 00:56:12,469
With the warrant denied,
there's no other option.

689
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:15,210
After today, there's nothing more...

690
00:56:16,909 --> 00:56:18,280
If we can't get inside,

691
00:56:19,409 --> 00:56:21,050
we'll make him bring Han Guk out.

692
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:22,920
What?

693
00:56:27,719 --> 00:56:28,789
Ms. Choi.

694
00:56:29,090 --> 00:56:31,590
We just got a warrant
to search the suspect's home.

695
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:34,699
They'll leave in 30 minutes.
Hurry over if you want the exclusive.

696
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:37,630
What was that about?

697
00:56:38,070 --> 00:56:39,130
You said...

698
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,840
your girlfriend lives nearby.

699
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,940
Tell her to bring her car quickly.
Let's cause a fender-bender.

700
00:56:53,050 --> 00:56:54,179
Be quick.

701
00:57:04,159 --> 00:57:07,000
Once we save Han Guk, I will kill you.

702
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:11,230
Han Seo Joon.

703
00:57:12,199 --> 00:57:13,769
I'll kill your son,

704
00:57:14,699 --> 00:57:16,369
then come to kill you.

705
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:44,570
- What?
- Han Guk's not here.

706
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:46,099
He's not in there.

707
00:57:46,530 --> 00:57:47,869
What? He's not there?

708
00:57:48,239 --> 00:57:49,300
Are we done?

709
00:57:49,969 --> 00:57:52,010
I'm busy. Can I go now?

710
00:58:01,650 --> 00:58:04,619
I think the sound came from the trunk.

711
00:58:05,590 --> 00:58:06,860
Open the trunk, please.

712
00:58:08,090 --> 00:58:09,420
Please cooperate.

713
00:58:39,989 --> 00:58:41,059
Are we done?

714
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:52,030
What happened?

715
00:58:53,269 --> 00:58:55,039

Quickly.

The epithelial on the band-aid...

723
01:02:00,889 --> 01:02:02,489
isn't Han Guk's.

724

But just in case, we're comparing it to
the other victims' DNA.

725
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:15,340
Detective Go, why did you lie?

726
01:02:15,570 --> 01:02:17,769
Why did you say you had a search warrant?

727

You.

728
01:02:20,139 --> 01:02:21,510
You knew all along, didn't you?

729
01:02:22,639 --> 01:02:24,380
That Sung Yo Han is Han Seo Joon's son.

730
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:28,019
That's why you said then...

731

- No, we're still looking.

here right now.

813
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:50,899
What?

814
01:13:51,170 --> 01:13:52,329
Where are you?

815
01:14:54,060 --> 01:14:55,100
Ba Reum.

816
01:15:10,739 --> 01:15:11,850
Ba Reum.

817
01:15:11,949 --> 01:15:13,010
Go, Bong Yi.

818
01:15:13,079 --> 01:15:15,119
No. Come with me.

819
01:15:15,180 --> 01:15:17,680
I will catch him. I'll do it myself.

820
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:21,260
I'll catch the scumbag
who killed your grandmother.

821
01:15:21,619 --> 01:15:24,529
- Still...
- Go and call the police.

822
01:15:26,229 --> 01:15:27,489
Go, quickly.

823
01:15:51,949 --> 01:15:53,090
Stop, stop.

824
01:15:58,729 --> 01:16:01,189
- Mr. Go! Mr. Go!
- Bong Yi.

825
01:16:01,529 --> 01:16:03,659
Go quickly. It's Ba Reum.

826
01:16:03,729 --> 01:16:05,000
Ba Reum...

827
01:16:06,369 --> 01:16:07,500
Come on.

828
01:16:32,029 --> 01:16:33,090
Mr. Go.

829
01:17:42,659 --> 01:17:43,659
(Hospital Pharmacy)

830
01:17:46,229 --> 01:17:49,739
(Emergency Medical Center)

831
01:19:38,750 --> 01:19:40,180
Finally, some quiet.

832
01:20:32,170 --> 01:20:34,800
(Mouse)

833
01:20:36,239 --> 01:20:37,270
Kang Deok Soo.

834
01:20:37,369 --> 01:20:40,310
If you do that once more, I will kill you.

835
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:41,779
Evidence Storage Team.

836
01:20:42,180 --> 01:20:44,180
We're given a gun too.

837
01:20:44,909 --> 01:20:46,250
Did you not find Han Guk?

838
01:20:47,409 --> 01:20:49,279
He must have swapped cars here.

839
01:20:50,420 --> 01:20:53,119
Even in death, you'll never be forgiven
for what you did.

840
01:20:53,189 --> 01:20:55,090
Then send more manpower.

841
01:20:55,260 --> 01:20:56,689
I can't do all this alone.

842
01:20:57,420 --> 01:20:59,090
Bring someone here yourself.

843
01:20:59,359 --> 01:21:01,390
You can't give up hope.
