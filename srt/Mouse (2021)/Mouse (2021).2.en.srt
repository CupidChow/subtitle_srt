No.

15
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:11,810
That day, did you see anything?

16
00:01:12,709 --> 00:01:14,950
No. I didn't see anything.

17
00:01:15,549 --> 00:01:16,680
Not a thing.

The higher being...

21
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,060
never answered my prayers.

22
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,730
I ended up becoming a murderer.

23
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,169
My first kill was clumsy,

24
00:02:14,669 --> 00:02:16,509
and I remember it being hard.

25
00:02:19,009 --> 00:02:21,750
But the thrill and excitement I felt...

26
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,780
never left my mind.

27
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,020
Early this morning,
at a boxing gym in Seokjin-dong,

28
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:31,020
the owner of the gym
was found burned to death.

29
00:02:31,389 --> 00:02:35,330
He was revealed to be a relative of
one of the victims of the Headhunter,

30
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:37,960
a killer that scared the nation
25 years ago.

31
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,099
Since that day,

32
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,199
my murders continued.

33
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:10,030
A mutated gene that was created
as society evolves.

34
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,159
The psychopath.

35
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:16,939
The top one percent are called predators.

36
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:20,710
A lion's instinct is to kill a rabbit.

37
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:24,080
To a predator, another human is prey.

38
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,080
A target to be hunted.

39
00:04:07,389 --> 00:04:08,789
I am a predator.

40
00:04:11,889 --> 00:04:14,330
That is how I was born.

41
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:27,470
(Mouse)

42
00:04:28,339 --> 00:04:30,509
Hey, you jerk! Stop right there!

43
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,379
Stop where you are, punk!

44
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:40,389
Come here!

45
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:42,889
You fool.

46
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,069
Stop.

47
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,889
You can keep quiet, hire a lawyer,

48
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:18,220
and everything you say
can be used against you in court.

49
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:22,129
What are you doing?
Are you going to shoot me?

50
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:25,060
You must have lost your mind.
Gosh, you're a police officer!

51
00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:28,529
You're right. I'm insane.
I'm totally insane.

52
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,910
Save me. Is there anyone here?

53
00:05:34,009 --> 00:05:36,310
- Save...
- Be quiet, you idiot.

54
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,079
You killed others and now
you want to be saved?

55
00:05:40,509 --> 00:05:43,649
Keep still. I'll finish it quickly.

56
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,019
Mu Chi, please. Don't do it.

57
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:51,120
You can't ruin your life because of him.

58
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,720
Get off me!

59
00:05:55,129 --> 00:05:56,129
Where are you going?

60
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:16,750
Come here.

61
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:22,050
Where will you go?

62
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:23,689
My gosh.

63
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:34,870
Hey, hey! Get down from there.

64
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,470
I'll feel so dejected if you fall and die.

65
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,569
Yes. Shoot me now.

66
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,170
Shoot and I'll just jump!

67
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:45,610
Who's shooting whom?

68
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,810
I just fooled around to scare you.

69
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:50,949
You fooled around? Aren't you that guy?

70
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:53,790
You shot from behind
to kill me as I ran away!

71
00:06:54,189 --> 00:06:56,420
You have a good memory.

72
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:59,060
Okay, then. Fine. I'll arrest you.

73
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:03,459
I'll arrest you. Get down from
the ledge. Let's arrest you.

74
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,399
I'll arrest you. Come over here.

75
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:07,670
Come on down.

76
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:09,899
But you better think carefully.

77
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,899
You sexually assaulted the sisters...

78
00:07:13,069 --> 00:07:15,439
and hammered them to death.
You get the picture.

79
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:19,939
But does our darn country execute people?
No, they don't.

80
00:07:20,209 --> 00:07:23,980
So what'll happen to you?
You'll rot in prison for eternity.

81
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:27,750
Guys with a pretty face like you...

82
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:31,290
Well, prisons are full of
all sorts of perverts.

83
00:07:32,589 --> 00:07:35,259
Even if you beg to be killed then,
there's nothing I can do.

84
00:07:37,829 --> 00:07:39,730
Hey! Darn you.

85
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,329
Are you really going to jump?

86
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:45,069
You're not getting the message.
Are your ears as tight as an anus?

87
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:48,269
Do you think I staked out
your lover's place for a year...

88
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:51,740
just to see you jump to your death?

89
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:52,980
Get down now!

90
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,910
If you jump, all the intestines
in your body will pop out.

91
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:58,480
Your body will just pop.
Think of who must clean that up!

92
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:59,779
You're so selfish.

93
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,790
Let's keep it nice and clean.

94
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:13,500
Okay, then. You stay right there.

95
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,870
I'll shoot from here.

96
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:18,699
Let's have you falling
as I shoot you and that'll be it, okay?

97
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,079
Okay.

98
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:28,910
My gosh.

99
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,519
I should quit drinking.

100
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:35,649
Where did he go?

101
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,289
Did he actually jump?

102
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:46,600
Darn it.

103
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,399
What a useless jerk!

104
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:30,840
Hello?

105
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:34,879
On my way to church at dawn,
I saw a flash.

106
00:09:34,909 --> 00:09:36,549
I came here to check it out.

107
00:09:37,549 --> 00:09:39,149
I can't believe this.

108
00:09:39,549 --> 00:09:42,649
She was struggling to
make ends meet as a single mom.

109
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:45,320
Do you smell alcohol?

110
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:54,870
Darn it.

111
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,809
What?

112
00:10:03,009 --> 00:10:04,440
She keeps moving.

113
00:10:05,539 --> 00:10:08,149
Stay still. Okay?

114
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,509
Stop right there.

115
00:10:11,379 --> 00:10:12,779
Hey, Mu Chi.

116
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:16,549
Hey. Did you see that?

117
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:18,519
The corpse keeps moving.

118
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:19,789
It's so fascinating.

119
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,029
Didn't I tell you that you'd pay...

120
00:10:22,059 --> 00:10:24,460
if you ever barged into
my crime scene while drunk?

121
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,330
That's hurtful. We're close colleagues.

122
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:31,669
Ki Hyuk, this is my case, not yours.

123
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,240
- Goodness.
- This is that scumbag's doing.

124
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:36,340
It's obvious, isn't it?

125
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,110
- You called him, didn't you?
- Well, he kept calling me...

126
00:10:42,149 --> 00:10:44,149
- I'll... I'll take him away.
- I know for sure it's that killer.

127
00:10:44,179 --> 00:10:45,720
- Mu Chi.
- Let me go.

128
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,389
- Do something.
- I said, let go.

129
00:10:47,419 --> 00:10:50,450
- Come here.
- That scumbag has killed again.

130
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:52,360
- How much did you drink?
- This is my case.

131
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:54,929
- Come over here.
- Hey.

132
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,330
No!

133
00:10:57,429 --> 00:10:59,230
This is new!
The price tag is still attached!

134
00:10:59,299 --> 00:11:00,700
Goodness.

135
00:11:01,129 --> 00:11:02,929
- Keep him with you.
- Yes, sir.

136
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:05,399
Ki Hyuk, I'm telling you!

137
00:11:05,769 --> 00:11:07,340
It's his doing!

138
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,840
- That scumbag's done it again!
- I'm sorry.

139
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:13,009
He kept threatening me to call him
whenever murder cases popped up.

140
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:18,049
He's being interviewed.

141
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:21,750
Stop him. Stop him from rambling!

142
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:26,220
I'm certain that the killer
who murdered that gym director...

143
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:29,059
is responsible for this murder as well.

144
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:31,360
That scumbag murdered her.

145
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,899
Perhaps, it's someone who's against
the big guy up there.

146
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:39,399
Or maybe it's the doings
of an attention-seeker.

147
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,470
The police believe that the one who killed
the gym director and the bar worker...

148
00:11:43,539 --> 00:11:46,879
is someone who's against
a certain religion.

149
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,379
They're currently carrying out
their investigation.

150
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,250
A flop once again?

151
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:01,460
I'll be long dead and gone at this rate.

152
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,929
I won't ever let that happen.

153
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:19,940
Has it been a year?

154
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,850
You said you'd kill the murderer
who killed those sisters...

155
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:27,620
then get incarcerated
so that you could kill me as well.

156
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:29,649
So why are you still out there?

157
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:31,860
What's the rush?

158
00:12:31,889 --> 00:12:33,190
You'll be dead anyway.

159
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:34,690
It won't take long.

160
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,429
Forget about the small fry.

161
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,100
I believe we're dealing
with a big catch this time.

162
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:42,470
Go Mu Chi.

163
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:45,000
You'll...

164
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:47,970
fail in the end.

165
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:49,870
What?

166
00:12:49,909 --> 00:12:51,440
You can't kill a person.

167
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,309
By looking at your eyes,
I can determine...

168
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:59,149
whether you're my kind
or just an ordinary human being.

169
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:04,519
I had no idea that you were an eye doctor,
not a neurosurgeon.

170
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:11,129
Someone who commits murder...

171
00:13:11,429 --> 00:13:13,460
has empty eyes.

172
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,070
But your eyes are full...

173
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:21,509
of rage, pain,

174
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:23,870
regret, sympathy,

175
00:13:25,379 --> 00:13:26,480
and love.

176
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,080
Cut that nonsense.

177
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,850
There's nothing you can do about it.

178
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:36,350
You're born with it.

179
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:38,490
So don't waste your energy.

180
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:42,289
Enough with this garbage.
Just wash your neck clean and wait for me.

181
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,559
It won't take long.

182
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:45,059
Sure.

183
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,129
I'll look forward to that day, kid.

184
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:05,679
Next time, slash me properly.

185
00:14:08,019 --> 00:14:09,190
Not here.

186
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:13,159
But here.

187
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,230
Recently,

188
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:23,730
I found a Bible at a murder scene.

189
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:26,039
There was this one verse that moved me.

190
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,740
And it gave me great enlightenment.

191
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,379
"Anyone who takes the life
of a human being is to be put to death."

192
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,610
"Anyone who takes the life
of someone's animal..."

193
00:14:36,649 --> 00:14:38,549
"must make restitution, life for life."

194
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,049
"Fracture for fracture,"

195
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,419
"eye for eye, tooth for tooth."

196
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:46,659
Leviticus, chapter 24, verses 17 to 20.

197
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:48,090
Amen.

198
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:51,230
Up until now,
I thought the big guy up there...

199
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:53,529
was delusional and
only demanded us to forgive,

200
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,029
so I badmouthed him quite a bit.

201
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:56,669
But I was wrong.

202
00:14:56,799 --> 00:14:59,669
So I'm going to listen to him.

203
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,340
I should pay back exactly what I got.

204
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:04,879
I shouldn't stop at slashing your throat.

205
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,409
I was enlightened.

206
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,850
Just like how you killed my mom
in front of my eyes,

207
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:12,649
I should kill you
in front of your kid as well.

208
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:15,590
That way, it'd be an eye for an eye,
a tooth for a tooth.

209
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:18,059
That's what he has taught us.
Don't you think so?

210
00:15:20,059 --> 00:15:21,289
What a shame.

211
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:24,330
I have no kids.

212
00:15:25,029 --> 00:15:27,769
What a shame. I saw your kid.

213
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,169
Don't try to fool me.

214
00:15:31,299 --> 00:15:33,639
I saw your kid next to your wife...

215
00:15:33,669 --> 00:15:35,909
with my own two eyes.

216
00:15:38,009 --> 00:15:40,610
The baby's dead. To be exact,

217
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:43,850
the baby was killed.

218
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:53,360
I heard a psychopath's love
for his children is incredible.

219
00:15:55,889 --> 00:15:56,889
What's wrong?

220
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:02,029
Do you not want your kid
to see your head getting sliced off?

221
00:16:02,299 --> 00:16:04,940
I understand. Your kid will remember it...

222
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:07,570
for a very long time.

223
00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:11,710
Such a memory stays with you forever.

224
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,850
Han Seo Joon, you just wait.

225
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,820
I'll make sure...

226
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:21,590
your kid goes through...

227
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,590
the same pain I experienced forever.

228
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:40,899
What a surprise.

229
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:44,169
I didn't expect to see you here.

230
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:51,009
How's Blessing?

231
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:54,250
You should've brought him. I was waiting.

232
00:16:57,019 --> 00:16:58,159
The baby's dead.

233
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,860
- What?
- To be exact,

234
00:17:04,029 --> 00:17:07,000
he was killed as soon as he was born.

235
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,000
I killed him myself.

236
00:17:11,769 --> 00:17:13,269
I came here to tell you that.

237
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,079
He had a striking resemblance to you.

238
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,339
That's why I did it.

239
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:24,250
I didn't want him to become
a wicked monster like you.

240
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:26,819
How dare you...

241
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:30,650
kill my baby?

242
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,759
How dare you, you little wench?

243
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,740
My son...

244
00:17:48,269 --> 00:17:49,940
is alive?

245
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:25,740
- Now, get rid of the thorns.
- Okay.

246
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:28,480
It's good to leave an additional stem.

247
00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:31,250
- She's really talented.
- That looks good.

248
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:34,450
People have been calling me dexterous
ever since I started learning from you.

249
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:35,589
Really?

250
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:43,490
They're called crape myrtles.

251
00:18:43,529 --> 00:18:44,500
(Go Mu Chi)

252
00:18:44,529 --> 00:18:47,630
Their meaning is
"to pine for someone who has left".

253
00:18:50,769 --> 00:18:52,039
Don't you remember me?

254
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,140
I've been to your house.

255
00:18:54,869 --> 00:18:55,940
My house?

256
00:18:56,769 --> 00:18:57,880
The snowman.

257
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,079
A snowman...

258
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,920
You...

259
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:09,990
Give me money.

260
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,490
What... What do you mean?

261
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:16,960
My elder brother had nine surgeries
thanks to your husband.

262
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:19,130
His next surgery is scheduled
for tomorrow.

263
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:22,500
But they won't do it if I don't pay
all the medical bills I haven't paid yet.

264
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:24,670
They will...

265
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,309
just leave him to die.

266
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,809
I'm sorry.

267
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:35,180
I... I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

268
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:39,119
You're sorry? I don't want your apology.

269
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,279
Just give me money as I said!

270
00:19:40,349 --> 00:19:42,049
- Hey.
- Give it now.

271
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:43,619
Give me money right now.

272
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:47,119
This isn't right.
Why must we live like this?

273
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:52,299
When you're living a happy life
as if nothing happened? Why?

274
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:55,829
Why? Why must we live in misery?

275
00:19:57,829 --> 00:19:59,339
Your husband
who turned out to be the Headhunter...

276
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,910
I heard he was a successful doctor.

277
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:03,839
Then he must have earned a lot of money.

278
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,380
Give me money. Give it now.

279
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,680
My brother will die
if he doesn't get that surgery!

280
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,809
Hey, let's...

281
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,720
Let's go somewhere else to talk.

282
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,250
Give me money.

283
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,619
Give me money
for my brother's surgery right now!

284
00:20:17,619 --> 00:20:18,759
Mom.

285
00:20:31,269 --> 00:20:32,839
Who is that idiot? Darn it.

286
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:38,609
I'm very sorry.

287
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,210
Got a death wish?

288
00:20:40,309 --> 00:20:43,950
I'm sorry. I think this bird hurt its leg.

289
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:46,880
Your car was coming, but it didn't move.
I ran into the road even before I knew.

290
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,750
You must've been startled.
I'm really sorry.

291
00:20:49,819 --> 00:20:52,390
You could've died
because of that stupid bird.

292
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,829
You're absolutely right.
I'm very sorry. I'm sorry.

293
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,109
I'm sorry. Drive safely.

294
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,240
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

295
00:21:12,309 --> 00:21:14,279
Is he nice or stupid?

296
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:31,829
Oh, right. I ran out of thread.

297
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:34,259
If I don't keep practicing,
my hands will get rusty.

298
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:39,240
Don't you know that thread is not allowed
in your prison cell?

299
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,609
Especially medical supplies can't be
provided upon an inmate's request.

300
00:21:44,809 --> 00:21:45,910
Just bring it.

301
00:21:46,339 --> 00:21:48,609
Your predecessors did as I asked
without complaining.

302
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,180
Do you think I studied so hard
preparing for the exam...

303
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:56,450
to become a prison officer
just to take care of you?

304
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:15,410
Don't get intimidated, Na Chi Gook.

305
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:22,410
Quiet! Quiet now!

306
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,750
You feel like a king since everyone
tiptoes around you, don't you?

307
00:22:27,849 --> 00:22:30,089
Wake up. However you're treated
by them in here,

308
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,390
you are a mere death row inmate.

309
00:22:35,589 --> 00:22:37,460
Your threats won't work on me.

310
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,200
So I told him,
"Your threats won't work on me."

311
00:22:43,269 --> 00:22:44,769
Then I left.

312
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:57,680
- What's this?
- You don't know because you're new.

313
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:00,079
Haven't you heard about the officers
who became disabled and retired...

314
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:02,019
because they got on Han Seo Joon's nerves?

315
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:04,690
He never does it by himself.
Other inmates do it for him.

316
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,960
Just give it to him
pretending you don't know anything.

317
00:23:11,529 --> 00:23:13,230
Where are you? Are you on your way?

318
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:17,430
You didn't bring your ID? Gosh.
Wait there. I'll go to let you in.

319
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,470
Hello.

320
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,940
(Repentance, Redemption,
Be Born Again with Sincerity)

321
00:23:21,509 --> 00:23:23,170
Please bring the costumes over here.

322
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,140
- Here you go.
- You packed everything, right?

323
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:28,349
- Of course.
- Cards too?

324
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:30,009
- Here they are.
- Good.

325
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,690
Gosh, here you go again.

326
00:23:37,819 --> 00:23:39,789
Are you Albert Schweitzer
of animals or something?

327
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,390
- Chi Gook is here.
- Guys!

328
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,430
- Hello.
- Hi, Chi Gook.

329
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,599
Hey, you look like a different person.

330
00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:54,240
- You look really great in that uniform.
- Thank you.

331
00:23:54,869 --> 00:23:57,809
Can't you throw out that knockoff watch?
Even I'm embarrassed.

332
00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:00,539
You two bought me this to congratulate me
on becoming a prison officer.

333
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:02,380
This is worth as much as
a genuine one to me.

334
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:06,549
It's my fault for letting
that fool buy the present.

335
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,549
He was fooled by a knockoff store
when he's a police officer.

336
00:24:09,619 --> 00:24:12,460
There's a dong on the eagle.
Couldn't you tell it was a fake?

337
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,660
And he couldn't tell "R" from "N" either.

338
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,490
I mean, what's "Anmani"?

339
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,559
He paid 1,000 dollars for that. Gosh.

340
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:21,400
Hey, it's not a dong. It's a leg.

341
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,230
Gosh, Dong Goo.
That's all you think about, right?

342
00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:24,839
This is why your nickname is
Porno Dong Goo.

343
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,670
If it's a leg, why does it have
only one leg?

344
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:28,269
Ba Reum, this is a dong, right?

345
00:24:28,339 --> 00:24:29,809
I just said it's not a dong.

346
00:24:29,869 --> 00:24:31,170
- Let go of me, you punk.
- Your reach is so short.

347
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,839
Hey, stop it.

348
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:37,049
Hey, how's work? Is it going well?

349
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:41,380
Well, I'm trying not to seem like
a pushover, but it's not easy.

350
00:24:41,849 --> 00:24:43,690
Ba Reum, did you bring a sewing kit?

351
00:24:44,019 --> 00:24:45,859
- Is it not in there? Oh, no.
- No.

352
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,119
I left it at home.

353
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:50,490
We can't perform
without a needle and thread.

354
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:52,259
- Look again.
- Gosh.

355
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:55,329
Would this work? It's for medical use.

356
00:24:55,529 --> 00:24:57,329
- Of course.
- Yes. It doesn't matter.

357
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:58,900
Thank goodness.

358
00:24:59,099 --> 00:25:01,809
By the way, have you seen Headhunter?
I heard he's here.

359
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,839
- Yes.
- Can you let me meet him just once?

360
00:25:05,009 --> 00:25:06,509
I joined his fan club too.

361
00:25:06,579 --> 00:25:10,579
What? I wondered what kind of thickheaded
idiots would do it. You did it?

362
00:25:11,049 --> 00:25:13,680
- "A thickheaded idiot"?
- You think serial killers are so cool...

363
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:15,420
because you watch only movies
like "Hannibal", right?

364
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:18,619
Scumbags like him keep committing crimes
because of losers like you.

365
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:20,160
Didn't you watch the news?

366
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:22,289
A single mother who had been
working hard to raise her daughter...

367
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:24,900
was stabbed 20 times and died. 20 blows.

368
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:29,230
Those scumbags act like they're some kind
of stars because of losers like you.

369
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:30,730
I understand. Let's drop it.

370
00:25:30,869 --> 00:25:33,839
That cowardly scum who hid like a rat
waiting to kill...

371
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:35,039
a fragile, weak woman.

372
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:37,470
I heard you! I won't ask you again!

373
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:40,079
You act like you're better than me
just because you became a prison officer.

374
00:25:41,109 --> 00:25:43,079
- Why that little...
- Hey, that's enough.

375
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:45,380
He gave up on becoming a public servant.

376
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:49,619
He started writing a movie script
to pursue his old dream.

377
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:53,119
He said that it's about a psychopath.

378
00:25:53,789 --> 00:25:56,160
He joined the fan club
just to learn about such people.

379
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:00,430
Is he dreaming to become
a movie director again?

380
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:04,299
He'll succeed.

381
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:09,109
Chi Gook, make up with him later
when we drink together, okay?

382
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:10,269
I'll do that.

383
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:13,910
Can you help me with something?

384
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,880
Lift it a little higher, Chi Gook.

385
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:21,119
It's so heavy. Why are we carrying this
when it has wheels on it?

386
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:25,019
It's because of the wheels.
If they're broken on this gravel path,

387
00:26:25,589 --> 00:26:27,460
we'll be in trouble
during our performance.

388
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:29,759
I'm sorry.

389
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:31,329
Let's take a break.

390
00:26:35,569 --> 00:26:37,769
- I guess it's exercise time.
- Yes.

391
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,710
You see,

392
00:26:43,809 --> 00:26:46,380
before I became a prison officer,
I thought...

393
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,549
that death row inmates would pray
for atonement for what they did...

394
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:52,480
to the victims every day
like a Buddhist monk...

395
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:55,150
locked up in an empty cell all alone.

396
00:26:55,789 --> 00:26:57,089
But it turns out...

397
00:26:58,119 --> 00:27:01,460
that they eat three meals a day
paid by taxpayers,

398
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:03,190
and idle away every day.

399
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:07,329
Watching those jerks made me wonder...

400
00:27:07,829 --> 00:27:10,930
how dumbfounded
the victims' families would be...

401
00:27:11,369 --> 00:27:14,670
if they see the criminals
living comfortably in here...

402
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:18,109
instead of repenting
for their wrongdoings...

403
00:27:18,779 --> 00:27:21,410
believing that they won't be executed
until the day they die.

404
00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:24,250
The bereaved must be
so furious and resentful.

405
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:29,390
However,

406
00:27:30,819 --> 00:27:32,390
earlier today, just for a moment,

407
00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:36,289
I got intimidated by a scum.
I'm ashamed of it.

408
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:38,190
What do you mean by that?

409
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:42,930
Actually, the needle and thread
I gave you earlier...

410
00:27:49,569 --> 00:27:50,609
That's him.

411
00:27:52,009 --> 00:27:53,309
He's Headhunter.

412
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:05,819
He looks like us.

413
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:09,559
Did you expect him to
look like Thanos or something?

414
00:28:10,829 --> 00:28:13,130
That means
there's a monster inside of him.

415
00:28:15,269 --> 00:28:18,400
(The Metamorphosis)

416
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:20,039
I'll take care of Na Chi Gook.

417
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,240
Find someone for me.

418
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:40,059
(Geumsin-dong bus stop,
village shuttle number 12 at midnight.)

419
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:44,829
(Byun Soon Young's house)

420
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:52,099
(Where Byun Soon Young's body was found)

421
00:30:04,509 --> 00:30:05,609
He has large feet.

422
00:30:15,019 --> 00:30:16,319
(North Mujin Police Station)

423
00:30:16,349 --> 00:30:18,960
What's taking him so long?

424
00:30:24,859 --> 00:30:27,660
Why are you ignoring my calls?
I texted you lots of times too.

425
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:31,900
Congratulations. You searched for him
high and low for a year...

426
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,440
and you finally caught
the sisters' killer.

427
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,269
I heard he killed himself.

428
00:30:35,309 --> 00:30:37,740
You still get the credit, don't you?

429
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:42,579
I'm so impressed. And to think
I looked down on such a great detective.

430
00:30:42,609 --> 00:30:45,150
You can brown-nose me all you want,
but I won't cooperate with you.

431
00:30:46,349 --> 00:30:48,279
I should congratulate you
on something else too.

432
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:50,049
You're the hottest person online.

433
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:51,960
"Did a drunk cop really do an interview?"

434
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:55,259
"Useless cops who drink
instead of catching criminals."

435
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:57,829
And your superiors said
you'd taken cold medication.

436
00:30:57,859 --> 00:30:59,000
Be quiet.

437
00:30:59,259 --> 00:31:01,700
Did I drive drunk?

438
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:04,369
I wasn't even on duty.

439
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:06,940
Can't a cop drink when he's off the clock?

440
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:16,710
You said it's
the same person who killed...

441
00:31:16,779 --> 00:31:18,349
- the gym director...
- I'm crazy when drunk.

442
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,980
I was just drunk and stupid.

443
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:22,720
You know that I never let go
like a pit bull terrier.

444
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,220
You weren't just being stupid.

445
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:26,920
On what grounds did you say that?

446
00:31:27,019 --> 00:31:29,329
I just can't think of any connection.

447
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:31,829
They're different neighborhoods
and different MOs.

448
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:34,730
What evidence made you say that?

449
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:40,500
What is it? What do you have? Tell me.

450
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,339
- Get lost.
- Hey!

451
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:46,410
Hey, hey. Detective Go...

452
00:31:50,109 --> 00:31:53,450
You jerk. Why did you show up there drunk?

453
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:56,019
- You should've gone home...
- I found some blood.

454
00:31:56,089 --> 00:31:57,750
- Have it tested.
- What were you thinking?

455
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:00,059
Are you listening to me?

456
00:32:00,289 --> 00:32:01,420
It's the same killer?

457
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:06,099
Why don't you just quit
being a cop to write novels?

458
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,359
I bet you'll become a bestselling author.

459
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,769
That familiar lullaby's making me sleepy.
I need to nap for a bit.

460
00:32:15,369 --> 00:32:16,869
What a troublemaker.

461
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:21,009
Let's not say anything.
I'm wasting my breath.

462
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:24,109
The less stressed out I am,
the less hair I lose.

463
00:32:26,549 --> 00:32:28,019
Why does he care about his looks?

464
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:31,289
(Go Mu Chi)

465
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:32,720
(Seokjin-dong Gym, Song Soo Ho's Death)

466
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:34,920
(Around 3am on Wednesday, October 23)

467
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,190
(Blood tested for DNA)

468
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:39,200
(Go Mu Chi)

469
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,730
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

470
00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:45,029
I'm the driver of Geumsin-dong's
number 12 village shuttle.

471
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,369
- Tell the truth!
- Darn it.

472
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,769
Someone saw you standing there.

473
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,309
Yes, that's him.

474
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,950
He was at the bus stop
when the woman got off.

475
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:56,980
Yes.

476
00:32:57,009 --> 00:32:59,150
I took note because I found it odd
he was there at that hour.

477
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,849
- I wanted to ask her out.
- I'm positive.

478
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,019
So I followed her.

479
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:03,819
But she freaked out and ran away.

480
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:05,890
I have pride, you know.

481
00:33:06,259 --> 00:33:09,160
I just went home. I swear!

482
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:13,859
Get him out of here.
And apply for a warrant.

483
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,700
But I didn't kill her.

484
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:18,299
I didn't kill her.

485
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:19,470
Come on out.

486
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,140
Let go of me! I really didn't kill her!

487
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:23,369
Will you get these off me?

488
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,509
- My gosh.
- I didn't kill her.

489
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,910
Hey. I saw you on the news.

490
00:33:28,309 --> 00:33:31,009
Detective. It really wasn't me.

491
00:33:31,049 --> 00:33:35,150
That gym director.
You said the same guy killed him too!

492
00:33:35,349 --> 00:33:38,119
- Stop saying you didn't do it.
- Let me go!

493
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:40,660
It wasn't him. His feet are too small.

494
00:33:40,819 --> 00:33:41,890
There's a witness.

495
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:43,460
The shuttle driver?

496
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:45,700
He saw him at the bus stop,
not the actual kill.

497
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:47,529
He has five records of assault and rape.

498
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:48,769
But none for murder.

499
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:51,000
He tried to rape her,
she fought back, he killed her.

500
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,299
There was no evidence of
attempted rape or resistance.

501
00:33:54,769 --> 00:33:56,970
- Go Mu Chi.
- What?

502
00:33:57,009 --> 00:33:58,240
Don't cross the line.

503
00:33:58,609 --> 00:34:00,710
Stick to your case.

504
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:02,779
You can't even find a suspect.

505
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:08,550
He's not the guy. You just won't listen.

506
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:09,989
Then who's the guy?

507
00:34:12,989 --> 00:34:14,090
You're still here?

508
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:15,760
Are you that bored?

509
00:34:16,059 --> 00:34:17,190
I'm really busy.

510
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,300
If you're that busy, go to work,
Ms. Choi the Producer.

511
00:34:22,329 --> 00:34:23,599
I am at work right now,

512
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:25,969
and you're being uncooperative,
Mr. Go the Detective.

513
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,599
I'm about to report on
the gym director's death,

514
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,010
but there's no suspect...

515
00:34:30,039 --> 00:34:32,440
and the detective in charge
is so darn uncooperative.

516
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,210
My show might get canceled.

517
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,750
Then report on something else.

518
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,849
Did I tell you to pick my case?

519
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:41,550
Who will you slander and
ridicule this time like when you...

520
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:42,989
reported the rooftop room sisters' case?

521
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:44,820
Are you trying to ruin me?

522
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:47,960
Switching to something else
would be humiliating.

523
00:34:47,989 --> 00:34:51,190
I won a prize for my work.
I can't do something like that.

524
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:52,400
Don't you think...

525
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:54,760
I should at least try to
poke you into cooperating?

526
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,170
Poke all you want.

527
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:05,780
I have no choice, then.

528
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:09,610
I'm about to lose my slot.
I'll report on something else.

529
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:11,980
Yes. You're doing the right thing.

530
00:35:12,179 --> 00:35:13,619
There are many other topics.

531
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:16,150
I'll be sure to
watch your program. Good luck.

532
00:35:17,889 --> 00:35:19,159
How about this, then?

533
00:35:20,489 --> 00:35:21,590
What?

534
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:25,429
A cop that's into illegal gambling.

535
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,500
Hey!

536
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:28,599
(Do not take photos in secret.)

537
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:29,769
You're hurting me.

538
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,940
A junior of mine is infiltrating
illegal gambling dens.

539
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:40,340
I was helping him edit his footage
and happened to come across that.

540
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:44,349
You're lucky my junior
doesn't know your face.

541
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:47,219
If this were to go on air, you'd be...

542
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,349
Darn it.

543
00:35:56,989 --> 00:36:00,960
Shall I report that you're a cop
who frequents illegal gambling dens,

544
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:02,269
or shall I...

545
00:36:02,329 --> 00:36:05,199
focus on the Seokjin-dong
gym murder like I was going to?

546
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,199
Make up your mind and call me.

547
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:15,280
Ms. Choi.

548
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:18,650
You disgust me. You're a leech.

549
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:22,690
Why are you so fixated on that case
out of all the others?

550
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:24,719
He's Song Soo Jung's brother.

551
00:36:24,989 --> 00:36:26,320
Isn't it just dreadful?

552
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,320
Both siblings were murdered.

553
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:32,630
I want to catch the killer
for their old mom at least.

554
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,829
Is that it?

555
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,500
Is it just out of pity?

556
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,400
It's not pity.

557
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:40,400
It's a sense of responsibility.

558
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:42,170
Responsibility?

559
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:48,010
Byun Soon Young disappeared from here
between midnight and 1am.

560
00:36:48,949 --> 00:36:50,079
From here?

561
00:36:50,309 --> 00:36:51,909
The news mentioned a drainpipe.

562
00:36:51,949 --> 00:36:55,179
Byun Soon Young took home
someone's leftovers to give her daughter.

563
00:36:55,219 --> 00:36:56,789
I found the bag here.

564
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,019
She was killed here.

565
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:01,019
I found a footprint here too.

566
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:02,929
A footprint?

567
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,389
- Then...
- Don't step on it.

568
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:05,960
Did you find anything?

569
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:07,360
He's no fool.

570
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,130
He'd cut off the bottom of his shoes.

571
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:11,000
So no one could trace him.

572
00:37:12,539 --> 00:37:14,900
Then why was the body
found in a drainpipe?

573
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:18,869
Was she initially attacked here,
then died there as she ran away?

574
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,039
Look at this.

575
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:23,309
There are scratch marks.

576
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,849
He murdered her here,

577
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,789
then dragged her around 100m.

578
00:37:33,059 --> 00:37:34,219
To the drainpipe.

579
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:38,360
Why?

580
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,699
I wonder why.

581
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,300
Why did he go through that much trouble?

Ta-da.

643
00:41:40,739 --> 00:41:41,900
- I should've known.
- Come on.

644
00:41:41,969 --> 00:41:44,570
- He's still in there.
- He's inside.

645
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,409
- Why is he still here? Let's do it again.
- No.

646
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,519
All right. He'll really disappear
this time around.

647
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:00,719
All right.

648
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:03,460
Let's open it.

649
00:42:07,829 --> 00:42:11,429
- One. Ta-da!
- Ta-da!

650
00:42:11,769 --> 00:42:13,769
- What?
- What happened?

651
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:16,340
- Is he...
- What happened?

652
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:17,909
- Goodness.
- What is that?

653
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:57,679
All right. Come behind me and look.

654
00:42:58,849 --> 00:43:02,380
When I got here, the victim's arms
were tied behind his back.

655
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:05,349
And his finger was also pointing upward.

656
00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:07,219
I thought his body was charred.

657
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,829
His entire body was burned,
but his finger was still raised.

658
00:43:09,889 --> 00:43:11,829
That means his phalange was dislocated.

659
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,530
On top of that, Song Soo Ho
never wore any rings.

660
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,699
The killer did it on purpose.

661
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:18,469
Now, look here.

662
00:43:22,469 --> 00:43:25,409
There's a skid mark underneath the ashes.

663
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,840
This means the victim's chair was moved
before he was burned.

664
00:43:27,909 --> 00:43:29,949
When I had arrived here,
that window was already open.

665
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:33,280
According to the gym members, they never
opened that window because it was broken.

666
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:34,880
So the killer did it?

667
00:43:36,019 --> 00:43:39,289
All right. Look where my finger
is pointing.

668
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:49,630
A cross.

669
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,010
Yes. The killer opened that window...

670
00:43:56,369 --> 00:43:59,710
and positioned the chair
so that the cross could be seen.

671
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:01,539
He was giving the finger.

672
00:44:02,179 --> 00:44:04,250
Then he set Soo Ho on fire...

673
00:44:04,349 --> 00:44:06,619
as if he wanted to show it to that cross.

674
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:10,289
These two cases have
another common factor.

675
00:44:10,489 --> 00:44:11,489
The killer's trophies.

676
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:13,789
Do you mean Byun Soon Young's toy ring
that disappeared?

677
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:16,590
Her daughter had bought it
as a birthday gift from a stationery shop.

678
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:19,760
But none of Soo Ho's belongings
were missing according to his case file.

679
00:44:19,829 --> 00:44:21,329
We had overlooked something.

680
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:24,599
There's something missing in here.
Look for it.

681
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,039
How?

682
00:44:31,639 --> 00:44:33,440
A precious item?

683
00:44:39,449 --> 00:44:40,650
Do you mean those gloves?

684
00:44:43,349 --> 00:44:45,150
Soo Ho sparred...

685
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:47,360
with those gloves on...

686
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:49,889
until the day before his death.

687
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:54,130
The day his sister bought them for him...

688
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:56,000
was the day she was killed
by the Headhunter.

689
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:59,570
Due to that reason,

690
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:02,440
he cherished those gloves greatly.

691
00:45:03,869 --> 00:45:05,570
Given the fact that the killer
took trophies,

692
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:09,380
indicates that the killer of the two
cases is a dangerous psychopath.

693
00:45:10,809 --> 00:45:13,849
The likes of him
consider murder as a hunt.

694
00:45:15,219 --> 00:45:18,090
He may be hunting someone else
as we speak now.

695
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:22,760
- Is he dead?
- What is going on?

696
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:25,659
What is happening?

697
00:45:29,699 --> 00:45:31,469
- What's going on?
- What is this?

698
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:32,769
Chi... Chi Gook!

699
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:34,800
- Goodness.
- What's going on?

700
00:45:36,469 --> 00:45:38,170
Please help us!

701
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:41,840
Officer Na is seriously injured.
Please hurry to the auditorium.

702
00:45:42,949 --> 00:45:44,809
Someone got hurt. I'll be back.

703
00:45:44,949 --> 00:45:46,150
What is going on?

704
00:45:46,949 --> 00:45:48,050
Help us!

705
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:51,190
- Look at him.
- Is he dead?

706
00:45:52,119 --> 00:45:53,760
Please turn on the lights!

707
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:57,460
- Turn on the lights!
- Call a doctor.

708
00:45:57,530 --> 00:46:00,000
- He's on his way.
- Which scumbag did this?

709
00:46:11,539 --> 00:46:13,210
- Chi Gook.
- Help us.

710
00:46:14,039 --> 00:46:15,739
- Hey!
- Gosh.

711
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:23,820
Bring me the thread and needle
you used for your magic trick.

712
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,349
Sorry? Okay.

713
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:41,000
That's him. He's Headhunter.

714
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:44,969
Don't touch him! Don't. Go away!

715
00:46:45,039 --> 00:46:46,980
Where's the doctor? Tell him to hurry.

716
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:49,210
- Over here!
- We're here.

717
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,309
- Hurry up.
- Hurry.

718
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:51,409
Excuse me.

719
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:55,179
We should take him to a bigger hospital.

720
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:58,519
His brainstem is losing too much blood.
He'll die if we don't treat him right now.

721
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:01,190
This isn't my specialty,
so I don't know what to do.

722
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:03,389
Then will you let him deal with this?

723
00:47:04,329 --> 00:47:07,900
Too bad then. I thought I could
brush up on my medical skills.

724
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:10,170
Please treat him.

725
00:47:12,369 --> 00:47:13,500
Father.

726
00:47:14,739 --> 00:47:16,769
Father, don't you know who he is?

727
00:47:21,079 --> 00:47:22,079
Let's ask him to do it.

728
00:47:22,679 --> 00:47:25,650
He's the only one...

729
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:27,750
who can save him.

730
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:38,789
Flip him over.

731
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:44,070
In the name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.

732
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:58,210
To sum up,

733
00:47:58,650 --> 00:48:00,079
a psychopath...

734
00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:02,750
who hates deities, religions,
and a cross...

735
00:48:03,050 --> 00:48:06,460
randomly chose Song Soo Ho
and Byun Soon Young as his preys?

736
00:48:06,889 --> 00:48:07,920
No.

737
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:10,690
The killer had a clear motive
to kill Song Soo Ho.

738
00:48:10,829 --> 00:48:11,889
A motive to kill him?

739
00:48:11,929 --> 00:48:13,599
Song Soo Ho was burnt to death.

740
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,800
But the autopsy report says that
multiple fractures were found...

741
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,739
all over his body from the skull
to the ribs and the thighbones.

742
00:48:23,139 --> 00:48:27,039
That means he was brutally
assaulted before his death.

743
00:48:28,679 --> 00:48:32,550
The killer hit the exact spots
where a human can feel the most pain.

744
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:35,849
Seeing that even
some pieces of cartilage fell out,

745
00:48:36,019 --> 00:48:37,750
it must have been unbearably painful.

746
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:40,690
Please...

747
00:48:40,789 --> 00:48:43,559
- It must've been so painful...
- Just kill me.

748
00:48:43,659 --> 00:48:45,530
that he begged the killer to kill him.

749
00:48:46,159 --> 00:48:48,929
But the killer didn't do as he asked.

750
00:48:51,130 --> 00:48:53,699
Until the victim breathed
his last in the agony,

751
00:48:53,739 --> 00:48:55,500
the killer watched him to the end.

752
00:48:57,869 --> 00:49:01,110
The motive to kill Song Soo Ho
was revenge.

753
00:49:01,409 --> 00:49:02,909
With utmost rage.

754
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:05,079
Revenge? Can you prove it?

755
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:07,519
I found a decisive clue.

756
00:49:24,099 --> 00:49:25,699
(Holy Bible)

757
00:49:31,039 --> 00:49:32,269
I had it tested,

758
00:49:33,039 --> 00:49:35,510
and it was saliva
mixed with Song Soo Ho's blood.

759
00:49:36,579 --> 00:49:38,880
That means it fell
from Song Soo Ho's mouth.

760
00:49:39,179 --> 00:49:42,349
Correct. The killer put it
on Song Soo Ho's knees.

761
00:49:43,389 --> 00:49:44,489
But why?

762
00:49:45,019 --> 00:49:47,690
Maybe to show
a particular verse to Song Soo Ho?

763
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,829
The killer might have made him
read it out loud.

764
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:55,099
"Wound for wound, eye for eye..."

765
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:02,599
This is the patient.

766
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:07,579
All right.

767
00:50:10,179 --> 00:50:11,179
The index finger of the right hand.

768
00:50:11,309 --> 00:50:12,610
The severed fingers are in there, right?

769
00:50:13,349 --> 00:50:14,449
The middle finger of the left hand.

770
00:50:14,579 --> 00:50:15,719
There's only one finger in there.

771
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:18,550
Two fingers have been severed.
You should find the other one too.

772
00:50:18,619 --> 00:50:19,719
I'll go and find it.

773
00:50:24,159 --> 00:50:27,599
After killing Song Soo Ho,
the killer put the bible back...

774
00:50:27,630 --> 00:50:29,159
on the bookshelf.

775
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:32,469
I'm sure it wasn't a mistake
to put it upside down.

776
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:34,269
The killer either wanted us to notice it,

777
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:37,110
or enjoyed watching us
wondering if we could see it.

778
00:50:41,139 --> 00:50:43,110
"Fracture for fracture".

779
00:50:43,679 --> 00:50:44,949
"Tooth for tooth".

780
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:51,349
If that's what he wanted to say,
it means the killer did the same thing...

781
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:53,360
that Song Soo Ho had done to the killer.

782
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:57,090
Did Song Soo Ho burn someone
related to the killer alive?

783
00:50:57,690 --> 00:50:58,789
I don't know.

784
00:50:58,829 --> 00:51:02,429
Everyone says that Song Soo Ho was
a person who couldn't even kill an ant.

785
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,769
You can never know a person completely.

786
00:51:06,869 --> 00:51:09,139
By the way, did you find
Han Seo Joon's son?

787
00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:11,039
What?

788
00:51:11,369 --> 00:51:12,539
I asked you a favor.

789
00:51:13,409 --> 00:51:15,679
Well... The thing is...

790
00:51:16,650 --> 00:51:20,179
I talked to the director,
but I was told to avoid sensationalism.

791
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:25,250
It's okay. I'm looking for him too.

792
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:27,889
What will you do when you find him?

793
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:30,329
Are you going to hurt him
instead of Han Seo Joon?

794
00:51:31,059 --> 00:51:34,329
I understand how you must feel,
but do you really have to find his son?

795
00:51:34,630 --> 00:51:36,130
His son hasn't done anything wrong.

796
00:51:38,199 --> 00:51:39,570
He hasn't done anything wrong?

797
00:51:41,199 --> 00:51:42,570
Then what have I done wrong?

798
00:51:43,409 --> 00:51:45,840
At least he has a dad who is a murderer.

799
00:51:46,110 --> 00:51:49,739
But my parents were upright and ethical.

800
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,210
What I'm saying is...

801
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:54,019
I'll make sure
his son lives with pain too.

802
00:51:54,050 --> 00:51:57,119
The same pain caused by the horrific
memory that I can never forget.

803
00:51:57,150 --> 00:51:58,719
I'll make his son live with that pain too.

804
00:51:58,750 --> 00:51:59,820
Only then, we'll be even.

805
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:02,090
That's what "eye for eye" means.

806
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:06,190
- Detective Go.
- Why?

807
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:09,360
You're saying that, but you could've
found him a long time ago.

808
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:10,900
You're not looking for him on purpose.

809
00:52:11,369 --> 00:52:14,639
If you kill Han Seo Joon in front of
his son, there will be another Go Mu Chi.

810
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,510
But you will still do it?

811
00:52:16,539 --> 00:52:18,340
Yes, I'll do it.

812
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:22,610
I want to know...

813
00:52:23,809 --> 00:52:25,449
where he lives and what he does.

814
00:52:39,789 --> 00:52:42,260
Why did you save me? Why?

815
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:46,400
You should've let me follow my son.
Why did you save me?

816
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:49,769
My dear Soo Ho...

817
00:52:51,739 --> 00:52:54,110
Soo Ho.

818
00:52:57,210 --> 00:53:00,820
If you really want to die,
cut right here deeply next time.

819
00:53:01,019 --> 00:53:03,889
It should be deeper than 2cm,
so you will not fail.

820
00:53:04,090 --> 00:53:05,789
Or you can cut an artery.

821
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:08,820
You can do that by cutting off your arm.

822
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:10,659
That way, you can kill yourself.

823
00:53:10,829 --> 00:53:11,960
Excuse me, Doctor.

824
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,429
I think you're being too harsh...

825
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,869
How can you say such a thing as a doctor?

826
00:53:16,929 --> 00:53:18,530
- Dong Goo, talk it out...
- Let go of me!

827
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:24,170
Apologize to her immediately, you punk.

828
00:53:25,809 --> 00:53:27,139
What must I apologize for?

829
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:29,110
- You little...
- Stop.

830
00:53:29,139 --> 00:53:31,380
No. Don't do that, Dong Goo.

831
00:53:31,679 --> 00:53:32,809
You shouldn't.

832
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:41,590
I wouldn't let it slide
if we weren't at a hospital.

833
00:53:45,829 --> 00:53:47,760
- Soo Ho.
- I'm sorry.

834
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:49,429
My dear son Soo Ho.

835
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:50,500
Who's the next patient?

836
00:53:50,530 --> 00:53:52,599
- He's from a car accident.
- My baby.

837
00:53:55,170 --> 00:53:56,610
Excuse me, ma'am.

838
00:53:58,070 --> 00:53:59,710
I don't know exactly.

839
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:03,449
But I'm sure the doctor
must have been very upset.

840
00:54:05,050 --> 00:54:07,949
I bet he said those things
because he wanted you...

841
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:10,090
to stay strong and hang in there.

842
00:54:10,119 --> 00:54:12,349
Excuse me. I brought Na Chi Gook's finger.

843
00:54:14,590 --> 00:54:16,190
Prepare Mr. Na Chi Gook for surgery.

844
00:54:16,219 --> 00:54:18,030
- Call neurology and orthopedics.
- Where did you find it?

845
00:54:18,159 --> 00:54:20,500
In the corner of the backstage.

846
00:54:20,829 --> 00:54:21,760
Thank you.

847
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,699
We need his guardian to sign
the consent form for his surgery.

848
00:54:23,730 --> 00:54:26,000
I signed the form on behalf of them
as they're on their way.

849
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:29,199
Sir, Dr. Park will need
another 30 minutes...

850
00:54:29,239 --> 00:54:31,309
to finish his surgery. What should we do?

851
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:33,269
It will be too late.

852
00:54:33,610 --> 00:54:34,909
Dr. Sung Yo Han.

853
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:36,579
Yes?

854
00:54:39,550 --> 00:54:43,250
We'll begin the surgery. Assist with it
until Neurology Chief arrives.

855
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,389
I'll prepare for the surgery.

856
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:49,059
Wait, Doctor. Is there any other doctor?

857
00:54:49,090 --> 00:54:51,659
He has operated on many patients
with brain damage. Don't worry.

858
00:54:54,599 --> 00:54:57,699
The killer is bold and meticulous
at the same time.

859
00:54:58,429 --> 00:55:00,900
Above all, the killer knows so much
about human body structure,

860
00:55:01,039 --> 00:55:03,440
and where to stab
to kill a person at once...

861
00:55:03,469 --> 00:55:05,340
or to make the person die slowly.

862
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:11,780
Just like someone who studied anatomy.

863
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:12,880
Scalpel.

864
00:55:16,519 --> 00:55:18,719
The killer is also very skillful
at using a knife.

865
00:55:31,429 --> 00:55:33,199

("The Youngest Surgeon To Pass
the Medical Licensing Examination")

867
00:55:49,150 --> 00:55:50,650
How is Chi Gook? Is he all right?

868
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:52,420
The surgery went well.

869
00:55:52,449 --> 00:55:55,159
But he was in a critical state
when he arrived. Let's wait for now.

870
00:55:56,090 --> 00:55:58,159
By the way, the emergency treatment
was done really well.

871
00:55:58,190 --> 00:55:59,460
Who is the doctor at the prison?

872
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:03,630
Actually, there was an inmate who used to
be a doctor at the scene.

873
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:05,769
His name is Han Seo Joon.

874
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:08,400
Han Seo Joon? Han Seo Joon...

875
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:10,510
You mean the notorious Headhunter?

876
00:56:11,039 --> 00:56:12,070
Yes.

877
00:56:12,239 --> 00:56:13,480
Was he at the scene?

878
00:56:14,739 --> 00:56:16,610
It could've been worse without him.

879
00:56:18,650 --> 00:56:24,489
(Patient: Na Chi Gook,
Nurse in charge: Kim Soo Hee)

00:56:24,519 --> 00:56:29,320
(Patient: Na Chi Gook,
Nurse in charge: Kim Soo Hee)

881
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:30,829
Ba Reum, they caught the culprit.

882
00:56:31,829 --> 00:56:34,559
Really? Who is that? Who did it to him?

883
00:56:35,059 --> 00:56:39,099
Well... It's one of the followers
of Han Seo Joon.

884
00:56:39,429 --> 00:56:42,469
He confessed that he planned it out
to teach Officer Na a lesson...

885
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:44,369
because he was
disrespectful to Headhunter.

886
00:56:44,909 --> 00:56:48,179
We're still trying to find out
if Han Seo Joon gave him a direct order.

887
00:56:51,349 --> 00:56:53,679
- What shall we do?
- How about a coin karaoke?

888
00:56:53,719 --> 00:56:56,079
- That's bad luck.
- Aren't you going to give me that?

889
00:56:57,849 --> 00:57:00,090
- Did you really think of it too?
- Of course.

890
00:57:17,309 --> 00:57:19,409
Come to pick me up. I think it'll pour.

891
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:23,380
Just hurry up.

892
00:57:30,590 --> 00:57:33,219
(Do Not Enter)

893
00:57:43,630 --> 00:57:45,369
(Do Not Enter, One Way)

894
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,000
Why won't she pick up?

895
00:57:53,739 --> 00:57:56,510
(One way)

896
00:58:10,059 --> 00:58:11,260
I'll just cross.

897
00:58:13,130 --> 00:58:15,460
(One way, No entry)

898
00:58:20,670 --> 00:58:23,570
(One way)

899
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:29,079
(One way, No entry)

900
00:59:19,829 --> 00:59:21,730
No! Please don't!

901
00:59:24,599 --> 00:59:26,230
- Who are you?
- Hands off!

902
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:28,940
- Lady! Lady!
- You evil man!

903
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,510
- Leave her alone!
- I'm Officer Jung!

904
00:59:30,570 --> 00:59:33,070
I'm Officer Jung! It's me, Officer Jung.

905
00:59:33,940 --> 00:59:36,280
What are you doing here?

906
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:41,780
Oh, my baby. My poor baby.

907
00:59:41,849 --> 00:59:44,389
Wake up. You're okay.

908
00:59:44,449 --> 00:59:47,719
My poor baby.

909
00:59:47,789 --> 00:59:49,820
- The puppy.
- What?

910
00:59:49,889 --> 00:59:51,730
- The puppy.
- Oh.

911
00:59:52,590 --> 00:59:56,130
I chased him off. Didn't I?

912
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:58,099
Everything's fine now.

913
00:59:58,170 --> 01:00:00,340
You are safe now.

914
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:03,969
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

915
01:00:04,539 --> 01:00:07,039
I'm sorry for coming late.

916
01:00:09,309 --> 01:00:11,150
Ma'am. Ma'am.

917
01:00:17,289 --> 01:00:19,690
What a brat.

918
01:00:22,019 --> 01:00:24,090
I'm sorry. I called out,
but she didn't hear me.

919
01:00:24,630 --> 01:00:26,760
I had no idea.

920
01:00:27,130 --> 01:00:28,929
I saw the blood on your clothes...

921
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,570
and got the wrong idea about you.

922
01:00:31,829 --> 01:00:33,940
You're not hurt, are you?

923
01:00:34,070 --> 01:00:35,639
No, I'm fine.

924
01:00:37,170 --> 01:00:39,110
You must be so worried.

925
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:41,679
Your friend will make a swift recovery.

926
01:00:42,110 --> 01:00:45,280
Try not to worry too much about it.

927
01:00:46,610 --> 01:00:47,679
I won't.

928
01:00:50,449 --> 01:00:52,250
Go on inside. I should go too.

929
01:00:52,989 --> 01:00:55,119
You can't leave looking like this.

930
01:00:55,190 --> 01:00:56,760
- Take a shower.
- No, thanks.

931
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:58,329
I can shower at home.

932
01:00:58,389 --> 01:01:01,599
You can't leave in this mess.

933
01:01:01,659 --> 01:01:04,769
If you meet any of the other old ladies,

934
01:01:04,829 --> 01:01:07,969
they might die of a heart attack.

935
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:09,940
- Come inside.
- No, it's fine.

936
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,469
- I'm fine.
- Take a shower.

937
01:01:11,539 --> 01:01:12,909
- No. Ma'am.
- Take this off.

938
01:01:12,969 --> 01:01:15,579
- Ma'am.
- Just come in and take a shower.

939
01:01:17,579 --> 01:01:19,309
Ma'am. I'll carry it for you.

940
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:20,480
Put it down.

941
01:01:20,679 --> 01:01:22,980
Gosh, this looks good. Thank you.

942
01:01:23,150 --> 01:01:24,550
Sit and eat.

943
01:01:25,389 --> 01:01:28,119
How many times must I say that...

944
01:01:28,190 --> 01:01:31,059
I was late helping the ladies make kimchi?

945
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:33,929
I bet you stayed late
to enjoy the free food.

946
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:37,099
How dare you speak like that?

947
01:01:37,469 --> 01:01:40,269
Yes! Your old granny
wanted some free meat,

948
01:01:40,329 --> 01:01:42,099
so I had some. So what?

949
01:01:42,170 --> 01:01:45,710
Are you pleased you stuffed your face?
Don't you think I like meat too?

950
01:02:01,219 --> 01:02:03,690
Why aren't you eating much?

951
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:06,059
Is it because of your friend?

952
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:09,300
You must eat extra well
at times like this.

953
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:12,530
Then your friend will get well soon.

954
01:02:12,929 --> 01:02:15,369
Have some of the rolled omelets.

955
01:02:15,469 --> 01:02:17,469
Just so you'd like it,

956
01:02:17,539 --> 01:02:20,309
I added lots of extra cheese.

957
01:02:21,579 --> 01:02:23,480
I don't like rolled omelets.

958
01:02:25,110 --> 01:02:27,150
My gosh. You eat with...

959
01:02:27,219 --> 01:02:29,820
such a sweet look.

960
01:02:30,449 --> 01:02:33,119
Everyone eats the same. No one's sweeter.

961
01:02:44,070 --> 01:02:45,130
Yes.

962
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:49,400
You're hurt?

963
01:02:52,570 --> 01:02:54,539
This looks bad. It must've hurt.

964
01:02:58,150 --> 01:03:00,110
It might fester.

965
01:03:01,719 --> 01:03:04,949
Let go! Why do you care
if I was hurt or not?

966
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:07,760
- I'm done eating.
- Bong Yi.

967
01:03:09,590 --> 01:03:11,929
You brat. Eat some more!

968
01:03:11,989 --> 01:03:13,900
- No!
- Darn her.

969
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:16,230
I hope you poop yourself to death.

970
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:19,300
You need to starve for days...

971
01:03:19,369 --> 01:03:21,469
until you realize what...

972
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,039
Never mind.

973
01:03:27,179 --> 01:03:28,409
So...

974
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:32,980
That's not the real her. Bong Yi acts out,

975
01:03:33,179 --> 01:03:35,150
but she's sweet and thoughtful.

976
01:03:35,179 --> 01:03:36,420
Of course.

977
01:03:36,519 --> 01:03:38,849
- You should eat some more.
- Okay.

978
01:03:39,619 --> 01:03:41,320
She's like that...

979
01:03:41,619 --> 01:03:44,159
because she's shy. That's all.

980
01:03:44,230 --> 01:03:46,429
She's shy. That's it.

981
01:03:47,159 --> 01:03:48,530
She's shy? Why?

982
01:03:49,199 --> 01:03:51,730
My gosh. It's because
the person she likes...

983
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:54,500
is sitting right before her, of course.

984
01:03:55,099 --> 01:03:58,309
The person she likes
just grabbed her hand.

985
01:03:58,570 --> 01:04:00,369
Wouldn't she feel shy?

986
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:03,579
Ma'am, I don't think
that's the case at all.

987
01:04:03,710 --> 01:04:04,780
What?

988
01:04:06,150 --> 01:04:09,349
Did you think about what I said?

989
01:04:10,889 --> 01:04:12,190
Ma'am.

990
01:04:13,050 --> 01:04:14,920
I'll be arrested. Do you understand?

991
01:04:15,019 --> 01:04:16,489
Will you stop kidding?

992
01:04:16,989 --> 01:04:20,929
All the elderly folk in the village
have the wrong idea about me.

993
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,360
- I am not kidding.
- Listen.

994
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:25,969
How old is Bong Yi?

995
01:04:26,530 --> 01:04:28,199
- I mean, she's only 18.
- Hey.

996
01:04:28,670 --> 01:04:30,769
Don't you play any tricks.

997
01:04:30,869 --> 01:04:33,869
She is 19 years old.

998
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:36,110
And my Bong Yi...

999
01:04:36,179 --> 01:04:38,610
may look thin and frail on the outside,

1000
01:04:38,849 --> 01:04:40,380
but she's a glamor girl.

1001
01:04:41,050 --> 01:04:43,119
- A drama girl?
- You know.

1002
01:04:43,449 --> 01:04:46,289
This, look, a glamor girl.

1003
01:04:46,489 --> 01:04:47,690
It's called an S-line.

1004
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:50,889
Things go in and out
where they're supposed to.

1005
01:04:51,889 --> 01:04:53,929
Thanks for the food. I should go now.

1006
01:04:54,460 --> 01:04:55,900
- I have to go.
- Okay.

1007
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:58,130
- Here you go.
- I'll take it. Thank you.

1008
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:02,070
I'm not speaking nonsense.

1009
01:05:02,170 --> 01:05:04,269
Think about it seriously.

1010
01:05:04,739 --> 01:05:05,769
- Okay?
- Yes.

1011
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:08,539
Let's say he killed Song Soo Ho
out of revenge.

1012
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:10,110
What about Byun Soon Young?

1013
01:05:10,510 --> 01:05:13,750
I sensed no emotion related to her murder.

1014
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:15,320
It was random.

1015
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:18,650
A 100-percent pure psychopath
like the Headhunter.

1016
01:05:19,590 --> 01:05:21,260
I think his instinct took over.

1017
01:05:22,519 --> 01:05:24,429
A psychopath...

01:05:24,489 --> 01:05:25,789

Daniel Lee?

1021
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:33,030
(Korean-born Daniel Lee Nominated for
Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine)

1022

(He was not to win the prize.)

1023
01:05:35,070 --> 01:05:38,570
Edmund Kemper shot
his grandparents in their heads,

1024
01:05:38,869 --> 01:05:40,980
then murdered them
gruesomely with a knife.

1025
01:05:41,079 --> 01:05:43,980
He said the only reason
behind it was that...

1026
01:05:44,210 --> 01:05:46,409
he wanted to know
how it felt to kill his grandparents.

1027
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:49,719
The first murder
woke his instinct to kill.

1028
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:53,619
Most psychopathic tendencies lie dormant,

1029
01:05:53,789 --> 01:05:56,559
then explode after a trigger or event.

1030
01:05:56,989 --> 01:06:00,030
The killer, for some reason yet unknown,

1031
01:06:00,090 --> 01:06:02,460
out of revenge, personal revenge,

1032
01:06:02,530 --> 01:06:04,030
killed the gym director.

1033
01:06:04,099 --> 01:06:06,230
That woke his killer instinct.

1034
01:06:06,599 --> 01:06:09,570
I would say he killed
the bar worker randomly.

1035
01:06:10,070 --> 01:06:11,969
The time between murders will shorten,

1036
01:06:12,110 --> 01:06:14,239
and he will become bolder.

1037
01:06:14,610 --> 01:06:16,409
I believe he's just getting started.

1038
01:06:17,380 --> 01:06:19,480
Other than these two victims,

1039
01:06:19,550 --> 01:06:21,719
there might already be others.

1040
01:06:42,869 --> 01:06:43,900
Lift that.

1041
01:06:52,179 --> 01:06:54,420
Last night, at a redevelopment site
in Guho-dong,

1042
01:06:54,519 --> 01:06:56,780
the body of a homeless person
in their 50s was found,

1043
01:06:56,849 --> 01:06:58,750
and the police are investigating the case.

1044
01:06:58,989 --> 01:07:01,489
The body was in advanced stages of decay,

1045
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:04,019
and is said to have been over 15 days old.

1046
01:07:04,090 --> 01:07:06,730
Before it's too late,
we must focus on this case...

1047
01:07:06,789 --> 01:07:08,929
without ruling out
the probability of serial murder.

1048
01:07:10,429 --> 01:07:11,929
The killing won't end.

1049
01:07:12,869 --> 01:07:15,099
If this truly was the act of a psychopath,

1050
01:07:16,099 --> 01:07:17,670
then even this moment,

1051
01:07:17,769 --> 01:07:20,269
he will be prowling, looking for prey.

1052
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:24,309
I'm not feeling too well.

1053
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:28,519
So today, I decided to find easy prey.

1054
01:07:31,690 --> 01:07:33,190
Someone small...

1055
01:07:33,349 --> 01:07:35,820
who obviously looks weak.

1056
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:39,159
That is ideal prey.

1057
01:07:39,230 --> 01:07:42,300
It is too hasty to say
the boxing gym director...

1058
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:46,070
and bar worker
were killed by the same person.

1059
01:07:47,070 --> 01:07:48,239
But...

1060
01:07:48,739 --> 01:07:51,469
if the person who killed
the Seokjin-dong gym director...

1061
01:07:51,510 --> 01:07:54,840
also killed the woman who was found
in a drainpipe in Geumsin-dong...

1062
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:57,750
and is indeed a psychopath,

1063
01:07:57,980 --> 01:08:00,710
we must stop the killer from taking...

1064
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:02,179
more innocent lives.

1065
01:08:04,519 --> 01:08:06,619
The Zodiac,
the serial killer of the century,

1066
01:08:06,820 --> 01:08:09,119
wrote this in his last letter...

1067
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:11,130
to the TV station.

1068
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:13,230
"Please help me."

1069
01:08:13,690 --> 01:08:15,500
"I can't stop myself."

1070
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:19,069
If this killer is indeed
a psychopath like him,

1071
01:08:20,130 --> 01:08:24,000
perhaps, they're desperately
wishing for our help.

- Good work.
- Good work.

Let's go.

1075
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:45,189
Zorro, where are you going?

1076
01:08:46,329 --> 01:08:47,500
Zorro, come here.

01:08:50,260 --> 01:08:52,369
Where did you go?

1078
01:09:00,340 --> 01:09:03,439
I don't think Officer Jung is
cut out for this job.

1079
01:09:03,479 --> 01:09:04,810
Tell me about it.

1080
01:09:05,250 --> 01:09:07,720
Don't you think the same killer
killed this cat as well?

1081
01:09:08,279 --> 01:09:09,449
It has no teeth.

1082
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:12,289
You're right. It looks like
it's been dead for a while.

1083
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:14,489
But the murder intervals
have become longer.

1084
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:15,960
Did he move or something?

1085
01:09:17,390 --> 01:09:19,859
- Officer Jung.
- Yes?

1086
01:09:22,329 --> 01:09:24,159
Judging by how you react to a dead cat,

1087
01:09:24,229 --> 01:09:26,630
you'll probably faint
if you see a dead body.

1088
01:09:26,670 --> 01:09:28,300
I'm sorry. I'll try harder.

1089
01:09:28,399 --> 01:09:30,039
It won't work.

1090
01:09:30,069 --> 01:09:33,369
There are leftover flyers in a cabinet
back at our office.

1091
01:09:33,409 --> 01:09:36,279
Go put them up
throughout the neighborhood.

1092
01:09:39,479 --> 01:09:41,619
You're like a sloth.

1093
01:09:41,649 --> 01:09:43,779
- Run!
- Yes, sir.

1094
01:09:44,949 --> 01:09:47,350
On the 13th, as Ms. A didn't
come back home from a walk,

1095
01:09:47,390 --> 01:09:49,460
her family reported her
missing to the police.

1096
01:09:49,489 --> 01:09:51,130
However, she was found dead...

1097
01:09:51,159 --> 01:09:54,329
- and...
- Goodness. Poor thing.

1098
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:58,399
You should come home early.

1099
01:09:59,270 --> 01:10:01,100
How could I do that when I'm a senior?

1100
01:10:01,340 --> 01:10:03,970
Look at you rambling nonsense.

1101
01:10:04,439 --> 01:10:07,409
Eat up and take a shower.
We'll be late for the mass.

1102
01:10:07,510 --> 01:10:10,640
Today is Father Go's
last day at our church.

1103
01:10:11,109 --> 01:10:13,409
He'll be moving to a church in Yirye-dong.

1104
01:10:13,649 --> 01:10:16,319
I'm busy.
I'm going to the library with my friend.

1105
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:17,789
Look at you.

1106
01:10:17,819 --> 01:10:21,319
You sound like
a top student in your class.

1107
01:10:21,489 --> 01:10:23,819
Gosh. And what if I become one?

1108
01:10:23,859 --> 01:10:25,829
Do you have enough money
to send me to college?

1109
01:10:25,989 --> 01:10:28,229
I see. Have you been purposely
coming last in class...

1110
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:30,460
because of me?

1111
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:33,970
My goodness.
What a considerate granddaughter I have.

1112
01:10:34,069 --> 01:10:36,199
You little brat.
I won't nag you about studying.

1113
01:10:36,239 --> 01:10:37,939
Just graduate high school...

1114
01:10:37,970 --> 01:10:40,140
and think of ways to marry Officer Jung.

1115
01:10:40,170 --> 01:10:41,079
I beg you.

1116
01:10:41,109 --> 01:10:44,979
Don't get all irritable in front of him.

1117
01:10:45,010 --> 01:10:48,420
Gosh, I'm so sick of you
talking about him!

1118
01:10:48,619 --> 01:10:51,319
Do you even know how big our age gap is?

1119
01:10:51,390 --> 01:10:53,689
- What?
- I'm not marrying a geezer.

1120
01:10:53,949 --> 01:10:56,689
"Geezer"? Don't be absurd.

1121
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:59,930
He's only around 25 years old.

1122
01:10:59,989 --> 01:11:02,130
- Yes. He is old.
- Look at you.

1123
01:11:02,159 --> 01:11:05,270
Let's be honest.
He's the best husband material.

1124
01:11:05,529 --> 01:11:08,470
He's like a little chestnut. Goodness.

1125
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:10,439
He's really good-looking.

1126
01:11:10,470 --> 01:11:11,770
A chestnut?

1127
01:11:11,810 --> 01:11:13,510
He looks so pale.

1128
01:11:13,539 --> 01:11:16,180
Guys like him are easy to defeat.

1129
01:11:16,210 --> 01:11:18,550
One hit like this,
and he'll be knocked out.

1130
01:11:18,710 --> 01:11:22,180
You little brat.
Is that all you can think about?

1131
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:24,180
You can look everywhere,

1132
01:11:24,220 --> 01:11:26,489
but you won't find another man like him.

1133
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:29,789
He's kind, handsome, and polite.

1134
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:32,590
And you heard that he even won...

1135
01:11:32,630 --> 01:11:34,560
a good citizen award too.

1136
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:36,829
While picking up waste paper, I fell.

1137
01:11:36,859 --> 01:11:38,430
Then he showed up,

1138
01:11:38,470 --> 01:11:41,439
put me on his back, and dashed away.

1139
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:42,869
If it wasn't for him,

1140
01:11:42,899 --> 01:11:45,770
I would be long dead and gone.

1141
01:11:45,810 --> 01:11:48,340
Why did he dash away?

1142
01:11:48,380 --> 01:11:50,439
He could've just called 911.

1143
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:54,350
Stupid people tend to do
more useless work.

1144
01:11:54,579 --> 01:11:56,020
You wicked brat.

1145
01:11:56,350 --> 01:11:59,350
Even dogs are allowed to eat in peace!
Why did you hit me?

1146
01:11:59,420 --> 01:12:01,689
At least dogs wag their tails...

1147
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:03,920
and greet you, you brat.

1148
01:12:06,430 --> 01:12:08,359
"Officer Jung this, Officer Jung that..."

1149
01:12:13,630 --> 01:12:14,899
(Police)

1150
01:12:14,939 --> 01:12:17,039
Eo Beong Yi.

1151
01:12:17,239 --> 01:12:18,739
Eo Beong Yi, wait.

1152
01:12:20,010 --> 01:12:21,939
Pronounce my name properly.

1153
01:12:21,979 --> 01:12:24,409
Or else, I'll rip off your tongue.

1154
01:12:24,609 --> 01:12:27,880
My name is Oh Bong Yi,
not Eo Beong Yi. Oh Bong Yi.

1155
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:30,850
Okay. Show this to your friends...

1156
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:33,189
and tell them to call the police
if they had witnessed anything.

1157
01:12:33,220 --> 01:12:34,520
Is this criminal still at large?

1158
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:37,520
We're wasting our tax money, aren't we?

1159
01:12:38,029 --> 01:12:39,859
This lunatic killed a cat
and pulled out its teeth.

1160
01:12:39,930 --> 01:12:42,460
And yet, you haven't been able
to catch this lunatic for months?

1161
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:43,829
We couldn't find any witnesses.

1162
01:12:45,829 --> 01:12:46,869
Oh, and this.

1163
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:50,800
(Sarang Pharmacy)

1164
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:52,170
It'll fester if you don't treat it.

1165
01:12:56,079 --> 01:12:58,180
Mind your own business, okay?

1166
01:12:58,850 --> 01:12:59,949
Hey.

1167
01:13:11,359 --> 01:13:12,430
- Hello, ma'am.
- Goodness.

1168
01:13:12,689 --> 01:13:15,600
What? Oh, it's my grandson-in-law.

1169
01:13:16,199 --> 01:13:17,659
Are you here to see me?

1170
01:13:17,699 --> 01:13:19,529
Yes. Hop on. I'll give you a ride.

1171
01:13:20,029 --> 01:13:22,939
But I don't think I'll be able
to attend the mass.

1172
01:13:23,270 --> 01:13:26,170
I need to go see Chi Gook
after dropping you off.

1173
01:13:27,069 --> 01:13:29,479
Father Go will be disappointed.

1174
01:13:29,510 --> 01:13:32,109
He cherishes you so much.

1175
01:13:32,149 --> 01:13:34,579
By the way, are you okay?

1176
01:13:34,619 --> 01:13:36,649
What? I'm fine.

1177
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:38,689
My leg is asleep.

1178
01:13:41,090 --> 01:13:42,989
Goodness. One minute.

1179
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:44,090
Gosh.

1180
01:13:47,630 --> 01:13:49,600
What? Ma'am.

1181
01:13:50,329 --> 01:13:51,470
What happened?

1182
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:55,840
You fell on your way
to pick up Bong Yi, didn't you?

1183
01:13:56,039 --> 01:13:57,439
That's why you were late.

1184
01:13:58,340 --> 01:14:01,840
- You see...
- She had no idea.

1185
01:14:02,479 --> 01:14:05,109
She thought you were late
because you were busy having meat.

1186
01:14:05,149 --> 01:14:07,850
Goodness. Promise me you won't tell her.

1187
01:14:08,119 --> 01:14:10,819
She'll get worried if
she finds out that I got hurt.

1188
01:14:11,020 --> 01:14:12,090
Okay?

1189
01:14:14,789 --> 01:14:18,390
Goodness. Ma'am, try moving it slowly.

1190
01:14:19,260 --> 01:14:20,359
Can you move it?

1191
01:14:20,460 --> 01:14:22,229
No. It hurts.

1192
01:14:22,260 --> 01:14:23,300
Okay.

1193
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:25,670
Thankfully, I don't think
you broke any bones.

1194
01:14:25,699 --> 01:14:27,130
I think you just pulled a tendon.

1195
01:14:28,739 --> 01:14:30,100
You injured this area as well.

1196
01:14:30,470 --> 01:14:34,010
Goodness. If you don't
treat this, it'll fester.

1197
01:14:35,609 --> 01:14:37,979
Gosh. You're breaking my heart.

1198
01:14:40,979 --> 01:14:42,079
This will sting.

1199
01:14:47,689 --> 01:14:49,060
- Isn't this cute?
- Yes.

1200
01:14:50,189 --> 01:14:53,060
He's the Goat Man. He's extremely popular.

1201
01:14:53,189 --> 01:14:54,600
Among kids, that is.

1202
01:14:55,359 --> 01:14:57,729
If you have this on you,

1203
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:00,399
you'll become a fashionista
in this neighborhood.

1204
01:15:00,930 --> 01:15:01,899
What?

1205
01:15:01,939 --> 01:15:04,770
A goat is going to make me become a what?

1206
01:15:04,909 --> 01:15:06,239
What is it going to do?

1207
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:11,850
From now on, I'll go.

1208
01:15:12,050 --> 01:15:14,510
What? Go where?

1209
01:15:14,619 --> 01:15:17,180
I'll pick Bong Yi up on rainy days.

1210
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:20,590
So just stay put at home.

1211
01:15:20,750 --> 01:15:25,430
Goodness. I can't let you do that.

1212
01:15:25,630 --> 01:15:27,899
I know you're busy with your own job.

1213
01:15:27,930 --> 01:15:29,760
Gosh, not at all.

1214
01:15:30,399 --> 01:15:32,300
Tending to our residents is my job.

1215
01:15:32,329 --> 01:15:34,640
Bong Yi is a resident, and so are you.

1216
01:15:35,770 --> 01:15:36,899
Is that so?

1217
01:15:37,140 --> 01:15:40,710
Then could you do me that favor...

1218
01:15:40,739 --> 01:15:42,640
just until I recover?

1219
01:15:42,739 --> 01:15:43,840
Sure.

1220
01:15:45,210 --> 01:15:49,279
By the way, why can't Bong Yi
cross bridges on rainy days?

1221
01:15:49,949 --> 01:15:53,020
What? Oh, that?

1222
01:15:53,420 --> 01:15:54,520
Well...

1223
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:57,859
Unlike how she seems on the outside,

1224
01:15:58,090 --> 01:16:00,960
she's actually very timid.

1225
01:16:00,989 --> 01:16:02,859
So every time it rains,

1226
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:06,670
she's terrified that she might
get swept away in the river.

1227
01:16:06,729 --> 01:16:08,170
That's why.

1228
01:16:08,199 --> 01:16:10,199
What? Goodness.

1229
01:16:11,770 --> 01:16:13,609
By the way...

1230
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:16,710
- The puppy.
- What?

1231
01:16:17,079 --> 01:16:19,010
I think she mentioned a puppy.

1232
01:16:19,050 --> 01:16:20,850
What was that about? What puppy?

1233
01:16:21,180 --> 01:16:24,079
Well... About that...

1234
01:16:24,550 --> 01:16:27,989
So... When Bong Yi was little,

1235
01:16:28,619 --> 01:16:30,960
she had lost her puppy...

1236
01:16:31,060 --> 01:16:34,159
and looked for it everywhere.

1237
01:16:35,260 --> 01:16:38,229
Goodness. We're going to be late.

1238
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:40,930
Okay. Let's go.

1239
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,439
You two are just the same!

1240
01:16:42,470 --> 01:16:44,369
How could you ask to save him?

1241
01:16:44,399 --> 01:16:47,869
Let him go. Don't blame it on him!

1242
01:16:47,909 --> 01:16:51,680
How could you say that
you forgave him on TV?

1243
01:16:51,750 --> 01:16:52,850
- Mom.
- How dare you?

1244
01:16:52,909 --> 01:16:54,680
Father. Are you all right?

1245
01:16:55,579 --> 01:16:57,680
Please comfort her for me.

1246
01:16:58,050 --> 01:17:01,090
- Yes.
- This isn't the time for forgiveness.

1247
01:17:01,390 --> 01:17:02,520
My gosh.

1248
01:17:02,590 --> 01:17:04,390
Do you believe in the Lord?

1249
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:11,670
I haven't seen you in a while, Bong Yi.

1250
01:17:11,899 --> 01:17:14,369
I asked if you believe in the Lord.

1251
01:17:15,069 --> 01:17:16,170
Of course, I do.

1252
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:18,970
When our hearts set in the Lord,

1253
01:17:19,439 --> 01:17:21,779
He hears our prayers.

1254
01:17:22,239 --> 01:17:23,979
When we are suffering,

1255
01:17:24,340 --> 01:17:26,779
He saves us.

1256
01:17:27,979 --> 01:17:31,279
That's not true. He didn't save me.

1257
01:17:35,220 --> 01:17:37,260
That's why that guy you believe in,

1258
01:17:38,689 --> 01:17:39,960
I hate with my guts.

1259
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:51,800
Where's my phone?

1260
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:58,739
What? It's my day off.

1261
01:19:01,479 --> 01:19:02,609
What?

1262
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:11,050
(Cash)

1263
01:19:12,220 --> 01:19:14,289
(Kang Deok Soo to be released next month)

1264
01:19:29,039 --> 01:19:30,170
Kid!

1265
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:32,710
I'll see you again!

1266
01:19:48,319 --> 01:19:49,590
You're Dr. Sung Yo Han, right?

1267
01:19:52,229 --> 01:19:53,930
Someone wishes to see you.

1268
01:20:35,970 --> 01:20:37,239
Song Soo Ho's gloves.

1269
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:39,069
Byun Soon Young's ring.

1270
01:20:41,109 --> 01:20:43,279
The homeless guy
was missing a shoe, right?

1271
01:20:43,340 --> 01:20:45,449
We checked and it's his.

1272
01:20:46,850 --> 01:20:48,109
Whose watch is this?

1273
01:21:02,529 --> 01:21:05,000
Inmate 4440, you have a visitor.

1274
01:21:10,699 --> 01:21:12,270
You asked to see me?

1275
01:21:19,779 --> 01:21:21,109
I wanted to know...

1276
01:21:22,750 --> 01:21:25,789
what my son has grown up to be.

1277
01:21:36,329 --> 01:21:39,430
There's neither a church nor a cross.

1278
01:21:40,829 --> 01:21:42,500
There's no sign of moving the body either.

1279
01:21:44,199 --> 01:21:45,409
Stop.

1280
01:22:10,159 --> 01:22:12,369
He cut a cross in her mouth...

1281
01:22:12,829 --> 01:22:14,770
and put her finger inside.

1282
01:22:21,369 --> 01:22:22,439
Take her away.

1283
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:51,970
(Bingo!)

1284
01:22:55,210 --> 01:22:58,479
(Bingo! I salute
Detective Go Mu Chi's deduction skills.)

1285
01:22:58,510 --> 01:23:01,979
(I pray! That you like my present.)

1286
01:23:12,529 --> 01:23:15,699
At the site, items belonging to
the dead gym director,

1287
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:18,159
bar worker,
and unidentified homeless person...

1288
01:23:18,229 --> 01:23:20,500
were found, shocking the community.

1289
01:23:20,829 --> 01:23:23,899
Police ruled these cases a serial murder,

1290
01:23:23,970 --> 01:23:27,010
and announced they'll put together
a special task force.

1291
01:23:29,340 --> 01:23:30,810
Mom said that...

1292
01:23:33,609 --> 01:23:37,119
there's a person other than me
who has the monster gene.

1293
01:23:37,180 --> 01:23:39,319
Other than belongings from
the four victims,

1294
01:23:39,390 --> 01:23:41,119
a man's wristwatch was found.

1295
01:23:41,189 --> 01:23:44,760
Police think there could be another victim
and are continuing the search.

1296
01:23:45,930 --> 01:23:47,859
I wondered all my life.

1297
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:52,199
What happened to that kid?

1298
01:23:59,439 --> 01:24:02,939
Did he become a predator like me?

1299
01:24:04,539 --> 01:24:08,350
Did he become
an ordinary person unlike me?

1300
01:24:34,970 --> 01:24:37,439
(Mouse)

1301
01:24:37,510 --> 01:24:39,779
Yesterday I... It's not that, Bong Yi.

1302
01:24:39,850 --> 01:24:42,119
Do you think it's because
I really like you?

1303
01:24:42,180 --> 01:24:44,149
- Bong Yi.
- If an adult male was inside,

1304
01:24:44,220 --> 01:24:45,550
it must've been quite heavy.

1305
01:24:45,649 --> 01:24:46,750
Go inside.

1306
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:49,489
Me? Okay.

1307
01:24:50,390 --> 01:24:52,630
Chi Gook's watch was found at
the site of a murder.

1308
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:54,260
What? It's whose watch?

1309
01:24:57,829 --> 01:25:01,229
I want to learn from you.
Can you include me in the investigation?

1310
01:25:01,300 --> 01:25:03,140
How did you know that?
We're investigating in secret.

1311
01:25:03,239 --> 01:25:04,670
Detective Go, what's this?
