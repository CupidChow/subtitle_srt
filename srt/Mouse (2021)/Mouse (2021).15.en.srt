(All characters, organizations,
places, and events are fictional.)

7
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,030
(COVID preventative measures were taken
and a child psychologist was hired.)

8
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:27,670
(The animal scenes are CGI.)

9
00:00:37,179 --> 00:00:38,439
Our Lord...

10
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:40,579
the Savior...

11
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:42,850
will...

12
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:45,520
save you.

13
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:55,759
Well? What do you think?

14
00:00:57,359 --> 00:00:59,600
I asked you not to make me a monster.

15
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,729
I begged.

16
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:06,000
But you disregarded my prayers.

17
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,540
What kind of a deity does that make you?

18
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,640
Now I'm the deity.

19
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:16,010
Everyone who believes
the nonsense you teach.

20
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,319
I will judge them all.

21
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:21,349
(I am the deity.)

22
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,319
(I am the deity.)

23
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:29,230
I am...

24
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:31,500
a predator.

25
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,599
I...

26
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:38,239
was a predator.

27
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:50,519
(Mouse)

28
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:10,870
(1 year ago)

29
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,370
Han Guk.

30
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:18,240
The detective didn't keep his word.

31
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,979
We should show him later on.

32
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:26,849
That I kept my word.

33
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,060
Those who do not envy or get jealous...

34
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:36,129
are sinners.

35
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,110
It was me.

36
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:03,560
It wasn't Sung Yo Han.

37
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,560
It was me.

38
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:10,229
Did you go to medical school?

39
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,060
How do you know all that?

40
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,270
It was all a lie.

41
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:22,409
Everything.

42
00:04:13,289 --> 00:04:14,830
Who is that idiot? Darn it.

43
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:18,600
I'm very sorry.

44
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,100
Got a death wish?

45
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:21,699
I'm sorry.

46
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,970
I think this bird hurt its leg.

47
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,600
Your car was coming, but it didn't move.
I ran into the road even before I knew.

48
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,709
You must've been startled.
I'm really sorry.

49
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:32,410
You could've died
because of that stupid bird.

50
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,250
You're absolutely right.
I'm very sorry. I'm sorry.

51
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:38,079
I'm sorry. Drive safely.

52
00:04:42,819 --> 00:04:44,360
Because of you,

53
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:48,290
I had to bow to the likes of him.

54
00:04:55,329 --> 00:04:56,899
I changed my mind.

55
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,370
You did wrong, didn't you?

56
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,509
To punish you for it,
I'll kill you slowly.

57
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:05,610
Very slowly.

58
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,720
I put on an act from start to finish.

59
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,699
- Hello, Auntie.
- You're up?

60
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,930
Yes.

61
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,699
Do you not hate your father
for abandoning you?

62
00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:05,100
No, I don't hate him.

63
00:06:05,569 --> 00:06:08,470
I'm sure he had his own reasons.

64
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,939
Your father might be watching this.

65
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,040
Are you Albert Schweitzer
of animals or something?

66
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:16,949
Isn't this cute? You'll become
a fashionista in this neighborhood.

67
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:20,319
I'll help them finish up.

68
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:24,220
All the acts I put on. The fake life.

69
00:06:26,089 --> 00:06:29,029
I mistook them for my real memories.

70
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,810
They were all my memories.

71
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,540
From the start,

72
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:48,279
none of them were Sung Yo Han's.

73
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:04,600
(Dong Goo)

74
00:07:08,069 --> 00:07:10,069
Ba Reum, Chi Gook woke up.

75
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,839
He regained his consciousness.

76
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:14,910
What?

77
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:20,649
He just woke up, so I don't know
how he is, but get here quick.

78
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,850
Okay?

79
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:36,990
(This residence will be demolished.
Please stay away.)

80
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:49,240
This blade wasn't always broken.

81
00:07:49,339 --> 00:07:52,079
Look at this.
We took these right after the incident.

82
00:07:52,209 --> 00:07:53,379
The blade's fine.

83
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:56,610
And Kang Deok Soo's blood was found
on this knife?

84
00:07:56,649 --> 00:07:59,949
So the one who killed him sneaked
into this place,

85
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,490
used this knife to kill him,
then put it back?

86
00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:05,420
Could this truly be revenge murder,

87
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:07,259
seeing how the killer took
Bong Yi's grandmother's knife?

88
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:09,160
How's it possible to steal this knife
from this place?

89
00:08:09,529 --> 00:08:13,230
- You should've taken proper care...
- It's possible if it was an insider.

90
00:08:13,329 --> 00:08:16,069
I'm telling you.
I told you it must've been an insider.

91
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,399
Then how could he have known
about the cigarette burns...

92
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:18,600
on Kang Deok Soo's body?

93
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,569
He came here, read Kang Deok Soo's file,

94
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,040
and took Bong Yi's grandmother's knife.

95
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:27,209
We checked the CCTV and saw no stranger.

96
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,209
He's right.

97
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:31,420
We also checked the CCTV
at the Mujin Metropolitan Police Agency...

98
00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:32,649
before and after the incident
and found nothing.

99
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,919
How's the progress
on Kang Deok Soo's case?

100
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:38,460
Not good.
We could find no leads or witnesses.

101
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,759
It's driving me crazy.
The higher-ups keep pressuring us.

102
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:42,830
The people don't want us to catch
someone who did the right thing.

103
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,629
They're refusing to stay still if we do.

104
00:08:44,659 --> 00:08:45,860
But the higher-ups are saying that...

105
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:47,129
this is a threat
against a law-governed country...

106
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,669
and want us to catch him
as soon as possible.

107
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,669
In any case,
I'm certain that it's an insider.

108
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,669
The fact that he took this knife means
he knew exactly what it was for.

109
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,870
He knew why that grandmother had it.

110
00:08:55,909 --> 00:08:58,340
Only the police know that. Only us.

111
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,009
This is terrible.

112
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,379
Does this mean
the killer is a police officer?

113
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:03,649
Where are you going?

114
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:07,080
I should report this
if the killer is a police officer.

115
00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:09,149
Just stay here for now.
We don't know that for sure.

116
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:10,960
Why are you in a rush?

117
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:12,120
He's right.

118
00:09:12,289 --> 00:09:14,590
Even if the killer took this knife,

119
00:09:14,659 --> 00:09:16,629
killed Kang Deok Soo, and put it back,

120
00:09:16,659 --> 00:09:18,460
we can't confirm
that he's part of the police.

121
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,100
Hundreds of people go in and out
of the police station.

122
00:09:21,129 --> 00:09:23,129
How did the killer know the passcode?

123
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:24,840
Do you leave the door open?

124
00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:27,870
I don't always close it.

125
00:09:28,009 --> 00:09:30,879
And the passcode is my birth date.

126
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,980
So pretty much everyone knows.

127
00:09:33,009 --> 00:09:35,809
Hey. Everyone in this country knows
your birth date. You caused...

128
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:41,750
If he really is an insider,
we need to be more cautious.

129
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:43,590
If we make it obvious,

130
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,490
he could hide.

131
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,889
We should investigate discreetly.

132
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,559
Detective Go.

133
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,360
Check the CCTV in here...

134
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:54,200
before and after
Kang Deok Soo was killed.

135
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:55,570
- Okay.
- Detective Kang.

136
00:09:55,669 --> 00:09:58,840
Find out if any of the workers
looked into his case.

137
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:02,009
So this is all the footage
from four days before the murder...

138
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,440
until four days after?

139
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:07,179
Yes. But the Special Task Force
already looked into this.

140
00:10:07,379 --> 00:10:08,549
Why bother watching them again?

141
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:09,809
You little...

142
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,649
Hey. Stop.

143
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,419
Rewind.

144
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:21,629
Isn't this part strange?

145
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,029
What is this? What's wrong with this?

146
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:25,230
Did you edit this?

147
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:28,399
No. After the Special Task Force took it,

148
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:29,730
no one looked at it again.

149
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,970
Give me the video file...

150
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:34,639
and the CCTV hardware
from the Mujin station. Hurry.

151
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,049
- Hey, porn boy.
- Catch it.

152
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,580
Porn boy.

153
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,750
Why aren't you welcoming your customer?

154
00:10:47,889 --> 00:10:49,149
Do you want to be unwelcome too?

155
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,919
I've turned over a new leaf
and have found a job as well.

156
00:10:52,059 --> 00:10:53,389
Why do you keep checking up on me?

157
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:56,259
Commit the same crime again,
and you won't be going to prison.

158
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:58,559
I'll cut your wrists off
and throw you into a pigsty.

159
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,659
Remember that.

160
00:11:00,299 --> 00:11:01,470
Look at this.

161
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:05,940
Someone cropped the footage.

162
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,070
Restore the lost footage
as soon as possible.

163
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:10,570
Let me know every time
you restore a part of it.

164
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,110
- Answer me.
- Okay.

165
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,009
He must be looking
for another criminal like me.

166
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,350
I wonder how raunchy this is.

167
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,720
You little punk.

168
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:29,590
I thought it'd be something interesting,
so I put my heart into it.

169
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:31,000
I guess he's already done.

170
00:11:31,529 --> 00:11:32,929
He sure is quick.

171
00:11:38,139 --> 00:11:42,940
(Here's the full footage.)

172
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,220
It's you.

173
00:11:54,889 --> 00:11:57,220
The fact that
he had been cropped out means...

174
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:59,220
that he's the culprit.

175
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:07,830
Gosh.

176
00:12:14,909 --> 00:12:16,009
What is that?

177
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,850
What's that paper?

178
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:26,279
What is that?

179
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,019
(Statement)

180
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:40,299
What? OZ.

181
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,299
You...

182
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:44,639
When was it?

183
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,340
This was the day I got hit in the head.

184
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,139
The parking lot.

185
00:12:54,309 --> 00:12:55,450
The parking lot.

186
00:13:01,149 --> 00:13:04,490
67D 6264.

187
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:07,529
Hurry.

188
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,769
Stop. Please zoom in.

189
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:17,899
Okay.

190
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:19,470
Where is that?

191
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,210
Okay. You filthy mugger.

192
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,980
You better not have thrown out
my family photo, or you're dead meat.

193
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,210
I got you.

194
00:13:27,309 --> 00:13:29,809
What? Is he still here?

195
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,549
This punk...

196
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:37,120
Has he been staying here for long?

197
00:13:47,429 --> 00:13:48,500
Excuse me.

198
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:50,299
What? Is no one in?

199
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:52,070
Excuse me.

200
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:57,909
What's going on?

201
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,539
(67D 6264)

202
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,149
Excuse me. Is anyone in?

203
00:14:01,409 --> 00:14:02,580
Darn it.

204
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:08,450
Gosh. Where did the car go?

205
00:14:14,429 --> 00:14:15,789
(Prison Officer Goo Dong Goo)

206
00:14:17,059 --> 00:14:18,129
Hello?

207
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:34,179
Are you okay? Are you all right?

208
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:41,250
On three.

209
00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:47,490
Put it down.

210
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:52,000
Wait.

211
00:14:52,299 --> 00:14:53,399
Let's rest for a minute.

212
00:14:53,429 --> 00:14:55,370
Gosh, you're so weak.

213
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:57,169
You just took a break.

214
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:59,799
Why are you already exhausted again?

215
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,870
How will you catch culprits?

216
00:15:03,539 --> 00:15:05,240
Work out. Please?

217
00:15:05,309 --> 00:15:07,809
I can't be bothered to do anything.

218
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:09,580
Let's take three.

219
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:18,460
Isn't this an MP3?

220
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:19,990
They still sell these?

221
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:23,759
My mom got it for me as a birthday gift.

222
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:26,230
It still works.
The audio quality is good too.

223
00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:28,600
I couldn't dare throw it away
because of her.

224
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,470
What is this music?

225
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:40,379
It's classical music,
but I don't know the title.

226
00:15:40,809 --> 00:15:43,080
I listen to this
when I need to concentrate.

227
00:15:44,649 --> 00:15:45,980
Every time I listen to this,

228
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,190
I calm down...

229
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,519
and can focus.

230
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,090
It's nice.

231
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,269
The magic show must be making you tense.

232
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,370
What is that?

233
00:16:11,009 --> 00:16:14,879
Oh, that? That's where the prisoners
used to shower after working out.

234
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:17,509
But after we built an indoor shower,

235
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,919
we haven't been using that
for quite some time.

236
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:23,019
So that's the outdoor shower.

237
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:25,720
I've always wanted to see one.

238
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:28,259
- Can I check it out?
- Hey.

239
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:44,110
The water is still working.

240
00:16:44,139 --> 00:16:46,580
Yes. It's still connected
to the waterworks.

241
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:47,879
Did you know?

242
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:49,350
Know what?

243
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:51,980
That you're despicable.

244
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,450
What?

245
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:56,289
What is this? Are you mimicking Dong Goo?

246
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,419
It doesn't suit you.

247
00:16:57,889 --> 00:16:59,990
Didn't we first meet in tenth grade?

248
00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:01,529
We were in the same class.

249
00:17:03,059 --> 00:17:06,059
I've been observing you ever since.

250
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:11,599
You're too humble.

251
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:14,839
You'd give me credit
for all the good deeds you did.

252
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:18,509
So? That's why I'm despicable?

253
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:22,109
Then I'll just keep being annoying.

254
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:26,049
That's when I started...

255
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,220
thinking of doing something.

256
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:29,650
Doing what?

257
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:36,289
Judging you.

258
00:17:51,609 --> 00:17:53,710
Why? Why?

259
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,680
One with no pride is a sinner, you jerk.

260
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,920
You said that scumbags like me...

261
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:09,059
act like they're like some kind of stars.

262
00:18:10,059 --> 00:18:11,400
You think I'm a cowardly scum...

263
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:14,630
who hides like a rat waiting to kill
fragile, weak women?

264
00:18:37,789 --> 00:18:40,220
Hey, Naked King.

265
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,829
It'll all spill out. What a mess. Darn.

266
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:31,440
Ba Reum.

267
00:19:34,809 --> 00:19:35,910
Hey, you look awful.

268
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:39,549
The visiting hours began. Let's go in.
Come on.

269
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,690
Dong Goo called me too. Let's go in now.

270
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:46,589
Come on in.

271
00:19:52,829 --> 00:19:55,400
Where are you going? Chi Gook is up.

272
00:19:55,869 --> 00:19:56,900
Let's go in.

273
00:20:00,069 --> 00:20:01,670
Come on. What's the matter?

274
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:03,039
Why are you so nervous?

275
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:04,779
Hurry up and go in there.

276
00:20:05,009 --> 00:20:07,240
Go. Come on. Let's go.

277
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,380
I...

278
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:50,289
- I was the one...
- Ba Reum.

279
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:04,430
Why are you standing here?
His arms must hurt.

280
00:21:14,579 --> 00:21:16,049
What's going on?

281
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:18,579
Why?

282
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:21,420
He clearly saw me.

283
00:21:28,859 --> 00:21:30,289
The visiting hours are over.

284
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:32,799
The patient needs to rest. Please leave.

285
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,809
She said Chi Gook needs to rest.
Let's get going.

286
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,660
He asked me why he was lying
in the hospital.

287
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,359
He doesn't seem to remember
what happened to him.

288
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:07,359
After a traumatic experience,

289
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:10,529
sometimes the brain blocks
the overwhelmingly stressful memory.

290
00:22:11,299 --> 00:22:13,740
Did you tell him what happened that day?

291
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,839
No, I didn't. I didn't want to shock him.

292
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:20,880
I lied that he got into
a major car accident.

293
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:23,009
He's still considerably unstable.

294
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:25,750
Although he regained his consciousness,

295
00:22:25,819 --> 00:22:27,549
his condition may worsen rapidly.

296
00:22:27,619 --> 00:22:29,549
We'll have to watch the progress for now.

297
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:36,059
Ma'am, please don't worry too much.

298
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:38,259
Doctors always say terrifying things.

299
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:41,630
They do that to avoid responsibility
in case things go wrong.

300
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:44,170
Chi Gook recognized Ba Reum, you know.

301
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,039
- He did?
- Yes.

302
00:22:46,369 --> 00:22:49,009
They hugged each other so affectionately
that it made me tear up.

303
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:50,970
Chi Gook didn't even look at me.

304
00:22:52,009 --> 00:22:53,839
Ba Reum, he didn't respond
until he saw you.

305
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,480
I'm so disappointed.

306
00:22:57,009 --> 00:22:59,079
It's a relief, Ba Reum.

307
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:04,250
Where are you going?

308
00:23:04,859 --> 00:23:08,329
Look at him. I guess he's so happy
that he's out of it.

309
00:23:08,829 --> 00:23:10,960
He and Chi Gook used to be like soulmates.

310
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,769
Yes, ma'am. Goodbye.

311
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,210
Generally speaking, it's true.

312
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:47,000
(Bong Yi)

313
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,599
(Bong Yi)

314
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:55,769
Is something wrong?

315
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:58,140
We found Chi Gook's clothes
and the murder weapon.

316
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:09,420
The person you have reached
is not available.

317
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,859
I saw the girl's killer
who was on the news.

318
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:18,130
What should I do?

319
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:23,170
Whom did she see when I'm here?
That senile old bag.

320
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:27,569
You have one new voice message.

321
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,170
Why aren't you picking up your phone?

322
00:24:30,509 --> 00:24:33,210
My goodness. I can't do a thing myself...

323
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,410
because I'm too terrified.

324
00:24:35,779 --> 00:24:39,220
Please come meet me at the General Store.

325
00:24:39,579 --> 00:24:41,279
I have a photo.

326
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:44,150
"A photo"? What is she talking about?

327
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:08,710
Ma'am. Ma'am, it's me, Officer Jung.

328
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,019
Officer Jung.

329
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,990
You scared the life out of me.

330
00:25:18,019 --> 00:25:19,589
- Be careful.
- Give me a second.

331
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:21,930
- Be careful.
- I was so scared.

332
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:26,259
By the way, what do you mean by that?
You have a photo?

333
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:29,569
Oh, that. I was working at this house.

334
00:25:29,869 --> 00:25:33,440
You know the girl who was killed
at a vineyard, right?

335
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,440
- Yes.
- I found that girl's photo...

336
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:38,710
in that house. Here. Take a look.

337
00:25:40,609 --> 00:25:42,549
I ran out of the place with this photo.

338
00:25:46,849 --> 00:25:48,079
Wait.

339
00:25:49,789 --> 00:25:53,390
That looks like the button
on Bong Yi's school uniform...

340
00:25:56,259 --> 00:25:57,690
Where did you get this photo?

341
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:37,730
My baby...

342
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,869
My baby...

343
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:44,210
What should I do about the poor thing?

344
00:26:45,609 --> 00:26:47,410
My baby...

345
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,710
You must find that scum.

346
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:52,579
Find the scum
who killed my grandma, you jerk.

347
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:55,619
Grandma. I'm...

348
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:58,859
I'm really sorry.

349
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:02,089
I'm sorry.

350
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:04,329
I'm...

351
00:27:50,069 --> 00:27:51,170
(I am the deity.)

352
00:27:52,579 --> 00:27:54,609
Do you think you're a deity?

353
00:27:55,109 --> 00:27:56,809
I've seen someone like you.

354
00:27:57,150 --> 00:28:00,450
You considered sinners as people
who didn't commit the seven sins,

355
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,849
and punished them yourself.

356
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:05,019
Too bad, though. You're not even human.

357
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:07,990
You are just a disgusting monster.

358
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,359
Just a monster who can never
achieve salvation.

359
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:12,660
You're worse than scum.

360
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:15,099
I pity you.

361
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:16,930
You're done for, you scum.

362
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:18,029
You think? You're wrong.

363
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:23,170
Too bad, Father.

364
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:26,740
Your brother got it wrong.

365
00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:29,480
I got it right. Where's the kid?

366
00:28:29,509 --> 00:28:31,680
Where is the kid, you scum?

367
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,789
He's the one who didn't commit wrath,
not Han Guk.

368
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:38,460
He's a sinner who didn't feel...

369
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:40,859
the wrath.

370
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:43,329
- Mu Won.
- I said I would kill him when...

371
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:45,599
the show ended
unless you figured out the answer.

372
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:47,400
- Mu Won.
- Does it make sense?

373
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:51,430
I mean, Headhunter killed his parents
by cutting off their heads,

374
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:54,500
and made him disabled.
But he forgave Headhunter.

375
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,609
It was disgusting.

376
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,680
I was wrong.

377
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:03,349
I shouldn't have acted up.
Please forgive me.

378
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:04,950
I'm sorry.

379
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:06,720
Kill me.

380
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,380
Kill me.

381
00:29:08,589 --> 00:29:10,089
I will die instead.

382
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:12,619
Let my poor brother go.

383
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:14,859
Let my brother go.

384
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:17,759
Mu Chi. I'm okay.

385
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:19,829
Whatever happens to me,

386
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:21,869
it's not your fault.

387
00:29:22,369 --> 00:29:23,430
Okay?

388
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,529
It's your last chance.

389
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:26,769
Be angry. Show fury.

390
00:29:26,869 --> 00:29:28,640
To the Headhunter who killed your parents.

391
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:30,609
To the world who let him live.

392
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:32,180
Let your anger explode.

393
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,450
Please. Mu Won.

394
00:29:41,779 --> 00:29:43,950
My dear brother.

395
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:46,920
I am...

396
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,630
so sorry.

397
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:55,230
Please, Mu Won. Mu Won.

398
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:58,569
I'm sorry.

399
00:30:05,779 --> 00:30:08,309
(I am the deity.)

400
00:30:09,609 --> 00:30:11,609
(I am the deity.)

401
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:17,420
You should've just let me die then.

402
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:20,190
The me back then...

403
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:25,299
wouldn't have felt the emotions
as if my limbs are being torn off.

404
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:28,730
Is this...

405
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:31,430
the punishment...

406
00:30:33,099 --> 00:30:34,269
you're giving me?

407
00:31:14,309 --> 00:31:15,910
The visiting hours are over.

408
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:18,349
The patient needs to rest. Please leave.

409
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,029
Something happened between the two.

410
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:32,660
Did they fight before his attack?

411
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:35,029
Even if they did...

412
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:39,940
Our Lord...

413
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,839
will...

414
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:45,480
save you.

415
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:50,980
Your victims...

416
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:56,019
Han Guk.

417
00:31:59,859 --> 00:32:01,019
(To be demolished. Do not enter.)

418
00:32:08,099 --> 00:32:10,630
The body will be damaged by
the bulldozers.

419
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,200
I must return him whole to his mother.

420
00:32:13,569 --> 00:32:14,799
That's the least I can do.

421
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,250
Where did it go?

422
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,650
What are you doing down there?

423
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,279
What happened to everything in here?

424
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:29,490
Get out of there.
We're tearing the place down.

425
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,890
- Get out.
- Where did you take everything?

426
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,089
No one took anything.

427
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,589
Just get out of there!

428
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:41,859
(To be demolished. Do not enter.)

429
00:32:43,829 --> 00:32:44,970
What happened?

430
00:32:50,509 --> 00:32:51,640
What happened to you?

431
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:53,339
Where is Han Guk's body?

432
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,210
Give it to me right now!

433
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:57,650
What do you mean? Han Guk?

434
00:32:57,710 --> 00:32:59,650
You hid Woo Hyeong Cheol's body too.

435
00:33:00,349 --> 00:33:01,549
Hand it over now.

436
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:04,220
I must return him to his mom.
Give it to me!

437
00:33:06,089 --> 00:33:07,420
Who is Han Guk?

438
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,359
Is he the kid Sung Yo Han kidnapped?

439
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:12,259
Why are you asking me about him?

440
00:33:15,099 --> 00:33:18,470
Did you really not hide his body?

441
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:20,539
How would I know where to find him?

442
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:24,440
Where is his body?

443
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,609
Did you remember...

444
00:33:27,609 --> 00:33:30,009
where Sung Yo Han hid the kid?

445
00:33:34,549 --> 00:33:36,750
If he didn't move the body, who did?

446
00:33:37,589 --> 00:33:40,119
Someone out there knows my identity.

447
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:41,720
Who is it?

448
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,259
Who and why...

449
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:01,410
Save me.

450
00:34:02,009 --> 00:34:04,480
Save me. Spare me.

451
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,819
Save me.

452
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:14,659
- Save me.
- Hey.

453
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:17,530
- Calm down. It's okay.
- Get off me!

454
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,460
No, no. I was here
with Goo Dong Goo and Officer Jung.

455
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,300
I'm a detective. I'm Go Mu Chi.

456
00:34:23,869 --> 00:34:26,199
I'm Detective Go Mu Chi.
Do you remember me?

457
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,340
Good.

458
00:34:30,539 --> 00:34:34,110
My gosh. Get back up on the bed.

459
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:44,789
You must've had a bad dream.

460
00:34:46,289 --> 00:34:48,590
You have nothing to worry about now.

461
00:34:48,829 --> 00:34:50,090
Your killer's dead.

462
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:53,230
Dead?

463
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:55,630
Who is dead?

464
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,369
The person who stabbed me is dead?

465
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:03,340
Your mother said
you don't remember anything.

466
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,969
What?

467
00:35:06,539 --> 00:35:08,340
My mom told me.

468
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:10,679
She told you you were in a car accident.

469
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:14,280
What? Oh... Well...

470
00:35:15,949 --> 00:35:17,550
"The person who stabbed me"?

471
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,659
My memory's beginning to return.

472
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:27,500
And? Do you remember what happened?

473
00:35:29,099 --> 00:35:30,230
Well...

474
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:32,800
I don't remember the guy's face.

475
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,769
Only that someone
attacked me in the shower.

476
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:38,980
I was attacked from behind,
so I didn't see his face.

477
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,679
In the shower facility?

478
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:45,250
So... Who was it?

479
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,550
Who's dead?

480
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:50,590
Instead of asking who attacked him,

481
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,389
he wants to know who's dead?

482
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:57,460
I'll have Officer Jung
bring you the info on the culprit.

483
00:35:59,829 --> 00:36:02,869
Why does he get so nervous
whenever I mention Officer Jung?

484
00:36:03,429 --> 00:36:04,570
Get some rest.

485
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:06,599
Try to relax.

486
00:36:18,349 --> 00:36:20,179
Is this shower a shared facility?

487
00:36:20,349 --> 00:36:21,820
Yes, that's right.

488
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:24,420
Oh, right.

489
00:36:24,619 --> 00:36:26,519
We have another shower
that's been closed down.

490
00:36:26,619 --> 00:36:27,860
Could that place be it?

491
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,329
- It's closed down?
- Yes.

492
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,260
Where is it?

493
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,250
When was this place closed down?

494
00:37:30,449 --> 00:37:31,550
About two years ago.

495
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,360
I put it in this corner
as soon as I came in.

496
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,989
So it wouldn't be in the way
of the members.

497
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:39,559
He said the magic box was
always in the waiting room.

498
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,429
It'd take around three minutes from here
to the auditorium.

499
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:48,599
The killer attacked Chi Gook
and put him in the magic box?

500
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:52,610
The killer carried the bloodied guy
all the way to the auditorium?

501
00:37:54,579 --> 00:37:56,110
That doesn't make any sense.

502
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:17,429
If I die...

503
00:38:18,769 --> 00:38:20,940
If I just feign ignorance,

504
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,309
she'll look for him until the day he dies.

505
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,050
Yes. I should tell her the truth.

506
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:31,880
Hello. This is my boy.

507
00:38:31,949 --> 00:38:34,449
- I should tell her.
- Please help me find him.

508
00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:35,650
Thank you.

509
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:38,820
Ma'am.

510
00:38:41,219 --> 00:38:42,489
Officer Jung.

511
00:38:42,929 --> 00:38:44,460
Are you all better now?

512
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:47,030
(Missing Child)

513
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,329
What brings you here?

514
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,139
Han Guk...

515
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,309
You should...

516
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:03,579
stop looking for him.

517
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:07,480
What... What do you mean?

518
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,650
I...

519
00:39:13,989 --> 00:39:16,460
- I...
- Breaking news.

520
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:20,730
Kim Han Guk, who had disappeared
a year ago and is presumed dead,

521
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:23,800
was found dead in an abandoned factory
in Gyeonggi Province.

522
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,440
Han Guk!

523
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,050
Han Guk!

524
00:39:36,409 --> 00:39:37,550
Han Guk!

525
00:39:41,219 --> 00:39:42,420
Han Guk!

526
00:39:42,619 --> 00:39:44,389
- Han Guk!
- Ma'am, no!

527
00:39:45,889 --> 00:39:47,219
Han Guk!

528
00:39:49,829 --> 00:39:51,230
How?

529
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:53,929
Who could have done this?

530
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,300
Who?

531
00:39:56,929 --> 00:39:58,730
It was Sung Yo Han, that son of a gun.

532
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,269
That scumbag killed him!

533
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:02,710
That psychopath.

534
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,840
How were we supposed to find him here?

535
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,539
It would've been impossible.

536
00:40:18,289 --> 00:40:19,719
Do you know the time of death?

537
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:23,190
He was drenched in formaldehyde,
so I'm not sure.

538
00:40:23,389 --> 00:40:25,489
We'll need an autopsy to be sure.

539
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:37,670
That watch...

540
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:40,610
We should show the detective later on...

541
00:40:40,809 --> 00:40:42,849
that I kept my word.

542
00:40:48,519 --> 00:40:50,289
You have until exactly midnight
of the third day from today.

543
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:52,449
Will you give up on saving Han Guk?

544
00:40:53,289 --> 00:40:55,489
If you don't find me within three days,

545
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:59,159
the whole country
will see Han Guk missing his lungs.

546
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:12,409
(Stab wound on neck)

547
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:15,610
At 12am last night, Han Guk's time was up.

548
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:18,480
Experts are expecting an ominous result.

549
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:29,530
Does he...

550
00:41:31,929 --> 00:41:33,059
His lungs.

551
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:35,199
Does he still have them?

552
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:40,400
That cruel son of a gun.

553
00:41:41,539 --> 00:41:43,039
How could he do this to a child?

554
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,840
I'm sorry.

555
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:51,780
I'm sorry, Han Guk.

556
00:41:55,449 --> 00:41:56,750
I killed him.

557
00:41:57,289 --> 00:41:58,719
I was busy drinking.

558
00:42:00,219 --> 00:42:01,590
I had given up on him.

559
00:42:03,389 --> 00:42:05,090
I had completely given up.

560
00:42:06,059 --> 00:42:07,300
I killed him.

561
00:42:07,929 --> 00:42:09,199
Mu Chi...

562
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:13,340
I'm sorry, Han Guk. I am.

563
00:42:30,889 --> 00:42:32,789
The boy's body was found
in an abandoned factory?

564
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:37,130
Where is Han Guk's body?

565
00:42:37,329 --> 00:42:38,730
Give it to me right now!

566
00:42:40,829 --> 00:42:42,800
I think his entire memory has come back.

567
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:44,800
I must stop him before he does anything.

568
00:44:03,079 --> 00:44:04,150
You.

569
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:08,679
Give me back my gun.

570
00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:12,190
Give it to me.

571
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:14,860
Why are you doing this? Why?

572
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:22,130
It was me.

573
00:44:24,329 --> 00:44:25,769
It was all me.

574
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:29,300
I was the murderer, not Sung Yo Han!

575
00:44:30,739 --> 00:44:33,440
Bong Yi's grandmother, Father Go,
Chi Gook, all of them.

576
00:44:34,179 --> 00:44:35,840
I killed them all.

577
00:44:36,849 --> 00:44:38,110
All of them.

578
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,219
Do you not get it?

579
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,889
Song Soo Ho, Byun Soon Young,
Cho Mi Jeong,

580
00:44:44,949 --> 00:44:47,190
Kim Sung Gyu, Park Jong Ho, all of them!

581
00:44:47,789 --> 00:44:50,429
I brutally killed...

582
00:44:50,489 --> 00:44:52,659
those kind and innocent people.

583
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:56,769
I'm not human.

584
00:44:57,230 --> 00:45:00,639
I'm a monster.

585
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:05,309
So don't stop me from killing myself.

586
00:45:05,639 --> 00:45:08,940
Don't bother killing yourself.
You don't have much time anyway.

587
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:32,230
Twenty-one years ago,
I had visited Korea to attend a seminar.

588
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:34,599
I was staying
at my colleague's laboratory.

589
00:45:35,139 --> 00:45:37,369
Then one day, I received a parcel.

590
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:39,039
It was sent from an anonymous individual.

591
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:40,840
Who sent me this?

592
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:09,610
That's when I found out that Han Seo Joon
had successfully done a brain transplant.

593
00:46:09,739 --> 00:46:13,179
He wanted to brag about it.

594
00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:19,010
I was curious about how
that mouse would turn out.

595
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:23,150
So I started writing an observation log.

596
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,320
Day three. It's in great condition.

597
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:28,590
It's very active and shows no problems.

598
00:46:28,989 --> 00:46:31,130
It has normal bowel movements
and eats well.

599
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:33,030
It weighs 120g.

600
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,429
Day ten. Inactive.

601
00:46:36,829 --> 00:46:39,329
It became notably inactive and slow.

602
00:46:40,099 --> 00:46:42,699
Not having good bowel movements.
Not eating well.

603
00:46:43,309 --> 00:46:45,969
It ate much less food
than it did on the fifth day.

604
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:48,780
Day 20. It's in very bad condition.

605
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:50,280
It barely moves.

606
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:52,920
It lost 70g after the 1st day.

607
00:46:53,150 --> 00:46:55,679
I didn't eat any food.
It became notably skinny.

608
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:04,730
Day 30. Dead.

609
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:08,199
Han Seo Joon failed after all.

610
00:47:08,829 --> 00:47:10,230
You will die too.

611
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:23,079
How could you hide it from me?

612
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:26,219
What else are you hiding from me?

613
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:28,519
Did you know all this from the get-go?

614
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:30,619
Did you know that I'm a predator too?

615
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:31,889
Calm down.

616
00:47:32,219 --> 00:47:34,659
I wouldn't have asked you
to work with me if I had known it was you.

617
00:47:34,989 --> 00:47:36,860
I was sure that it was Sung Yo Han.

618
00:47:36,929 --> 00:47:38,960
How? What made you so sure of it?

619
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:42,329
I ran the DNA test for the fetus
that Han Seo Joon's wife was carrying.

620
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:45,800
The test result said the baby in her womb
was a psychopath.

621
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:48,539
I went back to the UK
right after carrying out the test,

622
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:51,170
and I didn't hear any news
about Han Seo Joon's wife.

623
00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:53,579
But 25 years after that,

624
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:56,010
I got a call from a TV producer.

625
00:47:56,309 --> 00:47:58,250
Hello? Daniel Lee speaking.

626
00:47:58,349 --> 00:48:00,619
Hello. This is Choi Hong Ju.
I'm a TV producer.

627
00:48:00,849 --> 00:48:03,719
I've been covering the serial murders...

628
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:05,719
that happened recently in Korea.

629
00:48:05,789 --> 00:48:09,090
I'd like to ask you a few questions
about the psychopath genes.

630
00:48:09,389 --> 00:48:11,030
That reminded of that child.

631
00:48:11,059 --> 00:48:14,599
I hurried back to Korea
to find Han Seo Joon's child.

632
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,230
I asked around
and found out where she lived.

633
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:21,340
And there I saw a dog that seemed to have
been abused a long time before then.

634
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:24,670
One of the common behaviors of psychopaths
is abusing animals...

635
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:26,480
since they're little children.

636
00:48:26,579 --> 00:48:27,909
That worried me.

637
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:30,280
I went straight to the hospital
where her son worked at.

638
00:48:30,349 --> 00:48:31,380
Save him!

639
00:48:31,949 --> 00:48:33,349
I'm pretty good with knives too.

640
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:36,320
The carotid runs through here,
so blood will pour out like a fountain.

641
00:48:36,989 --> 00:48:38,789
I believe it'll be quite a spectacle.

642
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:41,489
Sung Yo Han showed
all the behavioral signs of a psychopath.

643
00:48:41,590 --> 00:48:43,230
It was beyond doubt.

644
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:46,800
You were wrong.

645
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:50,769
By the way, have you recalled everything?

646
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:52,170
Yes.

647
00:48:53,199 --> 00:48:54,369
Everything.

648
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,940
I remember every little detail so vividly.

649
00:49:00,179 --> 00:49:02,610
That's all the more reason why
you shouldn't just die irresponsibly.

650
00:49:02,909 --> 00:49:05,380
If you think about the victims you killed.

651
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:07,820
But what can I do?

652
00:49:08,349 --> 00:49:10,690
I was going to turn myself in,
but the body was gone.

653
00:49:10,719 --> 00:49:13,489
If I can't even die
when that's the only thing I can do...

654
00:49:13,519 --> 00:49:14,960
Do what you can do.

655
00:49:14,989 --> 00:49:16,289
Find other predators with...

656
00:49:16,429 --> 00:49:18,429
psychopath genes just like you,
and get rid of them.

657
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:22,429
So there won't be any more victims
like the ones you killed.

658
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:24,929
That's the only way you can atone
for your sins.

659
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:27,539
- Atone for my sins?
- Yes.

660
00:49:27,769 --> 00:49:29,869
Do you seriously think
that my sins can be forgiven?

661
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:32,170
That's total nonsense.

662
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:35,610
Are you going to kill yourself?

663
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:38,550
That'll be so easy.
You won't have to take responsibility.

664
00:49:38,579 --> 00:49:40,219
But if you die like this...

665
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:42,349
What about Sung Yo Han?

666
00:49:43,289 --> 00:49:46,460
He was wrongfully accused of being
a psychopathic murderer and got killed.

667
00:49:46,489 --> 00:49:47,789
Won't you prove his innocence?

668
00:49:48,019 --> 00:49:50,889
If you die like this,
the truth will be buried forever.

669
00:49:51,230 --> 00:49:54,559
Sung Yo Han will remain
as a notorious serial killer...

670
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:56,769
while you will be remembered
as a national hero.

671
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:59,599
There was something fishy about him too.
He was suspicious too.

672
00:50:00,099 --> 00:50:03,139
He didn't report me to the police.
He tried to kill me instead.

673
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:04,969
Besides, you said he had
psychopath genes as well.

674
00:50:05,039 --> 00:50:08,239
No, he had a genius' DNA,
the remaining one percent.

675
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:12,050
He had a good will that normal,
good people have.

676
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:15,349
Based on his behaviors and the fact
that he was Han Seo Joon's son,

677
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,090
I misjudged him.

678
00:50:18,519 --> 00:50:20,289
I thought he was a predator.

679
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:22,360
On what grounds?

680
00:50:23,159 --> 00:50:24,960
What makes you so sure of it?

681
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:26,190
You are the proof.

682
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:28,800
You are suffering from guilt.

683
00:50:28,829 --> 00:50:32,500
You wouldn't feel any pain
if Sung Yo Han was a psychopath.

684
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:34,369
A psychopath doesn't have feelings...

685
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,070
like guilt, pity, empathy, and regret.

686
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:38,769
But look at yourself.

687
00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:41,780
You feel pain. You are suffering.

688
00:50:42,679 --> 00:50:45,550
Looking back now, it wasn't your memory.

689
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:49,079
What Sung Yo Han's frontal lobe
took over wasn't your memory.

690
00:50:49,150 --> 00:50:50,449
It was your emotion.

691
00:50:50,519 --> 00:50:52,719
That's why you can feel...

692
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:55,019
the emotions you didn't have before.

693
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:02,929
I wish...

694
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:08,099
I wish I didn't have such feelings.

695
00:51:11,869 --> 00:51:14,239
Many people from across the country
have been visiting...

696
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:17,110
the commemorative place
for Kim Han Guk who was found...

697
00:51:17,179 --> 00:51:19,079
one year after he was abducted
by the serial killer Sung Yo Han.

698
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:21,880
A memorial altar has been prepared
at the amusement park...

699
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:24,250
- where he disappeared.
- Spare the boy first.

700
00:51:24,389 --> 00:51:25,949
Han Guk who's below your feet.

701
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:28,460
He knew that Han Guk was there.

702
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:30,760
He was wrongfully accused of being
a psychopathic murderer because of you...

703
00:51:30,789 --> 00:51:34,030
and faced a wrongful death.
Won't you prove...

704
00:51:34,329 --> 00:51:35,829
his innocence?

705
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:37,900
Right.

706
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:41,869
I shouldn't die before I clear his name.

707
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,110
Maybe...

708
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:47,639
that's what Sung Yo Han wanted to do...

709
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:50,010
when his brain got into my head.

710
00:51:56,690 --> 00:51:57,949
I'm sorry, Han Guk.

711
00:51:58,590 --> 00:52:00,690
I caught the culprit too late.

712
00:52:01,519 --> 00:52:03,630
I will catch all the psychopaths
in the world...

713
00:52:04,429 --> 00:52:07,599
to make sure there will be
no victims like you.

714
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:10,599
I promise you.

715
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:15,500
That's the least I should do
to earn your forgiveness.

716
00:52:20,210 --> 00:52:21,539
(May Han Guk rest in peace.)

717
00:52:25,449 --> 00:52:29,380
(May Han Guk rest in peace.)

718
00:52:29,579 --> 00:52:31,750
- I'll have iced Americano.
- Me too.

719
00:52:44,969 --> 00:52:46,300
When is the meeting?

720
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:47,639
This week...

721
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:50,769
I'll go and bring my phone.

722
00:52:54,710 --> 00:52:57,980
I thought things barely died down,
but the body was found.

723
00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:00,349
Don't let it bother you.

724
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,420
Okay.

725
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:09,119
Hello? Is Eun Chong fine?

726
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:12,460
Of course. Eun Chong is sleeping now.

727
00:53:12,989 --> 00:53:15,199
Oh, my. How adorable.

728
00:53:16,869 --> 00:53:18,769
That's okay. Take your time.

729
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:20,239
Okay.

730
00:53:20,599 --> 00:53:21,699
She'll be late.

731
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:24,769
It's your turn.

732
00:53:24,909 --> 00:53:27,639
Gosh. I feel sorry for the kid's mother.

733
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:30,150
Her kid was found dead after a year.

734
00:53:30,449 --> 00:53:33,519
That scum brutally killed a little child.

735
00:53:34,579 --> 00:53:37,650
So this baby is the son of that killer?

736
00:53:37,690 --> 00:53:38,789
That's right.

737
00:53:39,719 --> 00:53:41,260
I know that he hasn't done anything wrong.

738
00:53:41,619 --> 00:53:43,219
But I hate him.

739
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:46,329
I guess he'll grow up
just like his father.

740
00:53:46,730 --> 00:53:48,829
The apple doesn't fall far from the free,
you know.

741
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:50,000
Absolutely.

742
00:53:50,030 --> 00:53:52,070
- What? Did I miss it?
- Gosh.

743
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:55,599
Just go to sleep, you psycho.

744
00:54:00,010 --> 00:54:01,179
Isn't it just terrifying?

745
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:02,940
I bet she didn't know that about him.

746
00:54:03,110 --> 00:54:05,750
She wouldn't have had his child
if she had known.

747
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:08,420
Wouldn't it be terrifying for her
to see her own baby?

748
00:54:08,449 --> 00:54:09,550
I heard it's a boy.

749
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:11,789
By the way, is he really
Sung Yo Han's son?

750
00:54:14,219 --> 00:54:16,489
Who had Sung Yo Han's baby?

751
00:54:17,030 --> 00:54:18,429
Choi Hong Ju...

752
00:54:30,739 --> 00:54:32,510
(The woman who had a child
with Sung Yo Han)

753
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:45,349
He was sleeping soundly just until now.
I don't know what's wrong.

754
00:54:46,519 --> 00:54:49,190
I wonder whom he takes after.
He's so prickly.

755
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:50,960
I'm so tired.

756
00:54:50,989 --> 00:54:53,059
I'm sorry. Please take good care of him.

757
00:54:54,630 --> 00:54:55,760
I'll give you some extra money.

758
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:58,800
- I'm sorry.
- Thanks. Don't worry. I'm off.

759
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,469
Eun Chong, why were you crying? Why?

760
00:55:05,539 --> 00:55:06,639
Are you hungry?

761
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:09,079
Good.

762
00:55:09,179 --> 00:55:10,780
Here you go. Have some.

763
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:13,150
You don't want it?

764
00:55:13,719 --> 00:55:15,250
All right then.

765
00:55:16,219 --> 00:55:17,289
Lie down here.

766
00:55:20,090 --> 00:55:21,289
Okay, okay.

767
00:55:30,570 --> 00:55:31,800
What's with all the crying?

768
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:36,099
Mom will sing to you.

769
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:37,510
It's okay.

770
00:55:40,179 --> 00:55:42,840
Okay, okay. Baby.

771
00:55:43,949 --> 00:55:45,079
Go to sleep.

772
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:49,679
Three bears live in a house

773
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:53,719
Daddy bear, Mommy bear, Baby bear

774
00:55:54,119 --> 00:55:57,730
Daddy bear is fat

775
00:55:58,289 --> 00:56:01,829
Mommy bear is slim

776
00:56:03,099 --> 00:56:05,400
Will you stop crying?

777
00:56:05,469 --> 00:56:07,639
Stop crying, drink some milk,
and go to sleep.

778
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,039
I don't want it!

779
00:56:13,639 --> 00:56:15,039
If you don't listen,

780
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:17,579
the Headhunter monster will take you away!

781
00:56:17,650 --> 00:56:21,579
That's scary. When will Mom come home?

782
00:56:25,789 --> 00:56:29,690
When you're scared,
remember the song Mom sang to us.

783
00:56:30,630 --> 00:56:31,989
Shall we sing it together?

784
00:56:32,489 --> 00:56:34,400
Then you won't feel scared anymore.

785
00:56:35,159 --> 00:56:39,099
Three bears live in a house

786
00:56:39,530 --> 00:56:43,769
Daddy bear, Mommy bear, Baby bear

787
00:56:44,110 --> 00:56:48,239
Daddy bear is fat

788
00:56:48,579 --> 00:56:52,210
Mommy bear is slim

789
00:56:52,849 --> 00:56:57,690
Baby bear is oh, so cute

790
00:56:57,750 --> 00:57:01,820
Shrug, shrug, there you go

791
00:57:05,559 --> 00:57:06,860
Mom!

792
00:57:08,199 --> 00:57:09,730
Mom.

793
00:57:42,429 --> 00:57:45,230
They say cars slow down
when turning a corner.

794
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:49,269
Wait until then, and jump out
when I open the door.

795
00:57:49,539 --> 00:57:51,239
- Okay?
- Hong Ju.

796
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:52,840
I'm scared.

797
00:57:52,909 --> 00:57:56,239
It's okay. I'll hold your hand tight.

798
00:57:56,309 --> 00:57:57,449
Trust me.

799
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,130
- Help us!
- Help us.

800
00:58:20,239 --> 00:58:23,269
- Help us! Help us!
- Help us. Help us.

801
00:58:23,639 --> 00:58:25,210
Is anyone there?

802
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:41,690
Hong Ju, my feet hurt. They're bleeding.

803
00:58:42,219 --> 00:58:44,130
Can you bear with it just a bit longer?

804
00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:46,960
I won't go. I'm staying here.

805
00:58:47,030 --> 00:58:48,960
We have to go. Come on.

806
00:58:49,030 --> 00:58:50,159
I won't go.

807
00:58:55,570 --> 00:58:58,610
Stay here, then. And don't make a sound.

808
00:58:58,769 --> 00:59:01,579
Okay? I'll get the police.

809
00:59:02,110 --> 00:59:04,309
Hong Ju. Stay here. Don't go.

810
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:15,960
Hong Ju, don't. Take me with you.

811
00:59:55,630 --> 00:59:59,969
Three bears live in a house

812
01:00:01,199 --> 01:00:05,739
Daddy bear, Mommy bear, Baby bear

813
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:10,809
Daddy bear is fat

814
01:00:19,519 --> 01:00:21,889
Baby bear is oh, so cute

815
01:00:22,489 --> 01:00:25,289
You must be in a good mood.
You didn't get anything on yourself.

816
01:00:25,630 --> 01:00:28,329
Your face is so clean,
I don't need to wipe it.

817
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:29,960
I know.

818
01:00:30,030 --> 01:00:32,869
She doesn't wander about digging anymore.

819
01:00:34,539 --> 01:00:36,639
- She must've given up.
- My baby.

820
01:00:37,769 --> 01:00:39,139
She isn't in the ground.

821
01:00:40,739 --> 01:00:43,079
She comes here. To see me.

822
01:00:47,949 --> 01:00:49,050
I know.

823
01:00:56,860 --> 01:00:58,329
This is terrifying.

824
01:00:58,789 --> 01:01:01,400
No wonder why her baby seems unusual.

825
01:01:01,559 --> 01:01:04,469
The baby won't stop crying
once the crying starts.

826
01:01:41,269 --> 01:01:42,469
Where is it?

827
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:44,769
I'm sure I put it in my pocket.

828
01:01:49,010 --> 01:01:50,610
No. Not that too.

829
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:56,679
That's the only thing I have
that proves I'm the killer.

830
01:01:57,619 --> 01:01:58,889
I must find it.

831
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:01,519
The evidence that I'm the killer
and not Sung Yo Han.

832
01:02:23,510 --> 01:02:26,610
How did Sung Yo Han
have photos of the people I killed?

833
01:02:26,750 --> 01:02:28,849
He knew I was the culprit.

834
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:32,590
Why did he try to save Han Guk
instead of reporting me?

835
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:44,599
He tried to say something to me.

836
01:02:56,210 --> 01:02:58,909
- Hello, Ms. Choi.
- Is Bong Yi sick?

837
01:03:00,179 --> 01:03:02,980
- Why?
- She isn't at work and her phone's off.

838
01:03:03,550 --> 01:03:04,719
I'm worried.

839
01:03:05,550 --> 01:03:07,860
If you're not busy, can you check on her?

840
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:11,329
Sorry. I'm a bit busy right now.

841
01:03:16,099 --> 01:03:17,369
We shoot in the afternoon, right?

842
01:03:26,539 --> 01:03:29,039
I wondered if you're sick.
Your phone is turned off.

843
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:31,510
You look terrible.

844
01:03:32,710 --> 01:03:33,949
Bong Yi.

845
01:03:37,789 --> 01:03:38,920
No, right?

846
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:42,659
You and my grandma's killer.

847
01:03:44,590 --> 01:03:45,730
No, right?

848
01:03:49,099 --> 01:03:50,300
It's true.

849
01:03:52,230 --> 01:03:54,739
Is that why you gave me a job?

850
01:03:55,139 --> 01:03:57,639
Did you think you'd feel
a bit less guilty?

851
01:03:57,739 --> 01:04:00,010
- Bong Yi, it's not that.
- Who I am.

852
01:04:01,010 --> 01:04:02,840
You know that.

853
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:07,980
Sung Yo Han killed my grandma.
You knew that.

854
01:04:09,849 --> 01:04:11,190
How could you do this?

855
01:04:11,420 --> 01:04:12,989
How could you...

856
01:04:14,519 --> 01:04:18,489
Were you with him
the day he killed my grandma?

857
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:20,699
Bong Yi.

858
01:04:26,599 --> 01:04:27,800
The scumbag's kid.

859
01:04:29,570 --> 01:04:31,369
I will curse it forever.

860
01:04:55,559 --> 01:04:57,000
Nurse.

861
01:04:57,530 --> 01:04:59,099
Can you pass me my phone?

862
01:04:59,170 --> 01:05:05,739
(Prison officer attempted murder)

863
01:05:11,050 --> 01:05:12,449
Are the results out?

864
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:14,980
Yes. It's Na Chi Gook's blood.

865
01:05:15,179 --> 01:05:16,320
Where did you find it?

866
01:05:17,820 --> 01:05:20,389
So he was attacked in the shower.

867
01:05:55,090 --> 01:05:57,429
Sung Yo Han isn't the real murderer...

868
01:05:57,960 --> 01:05:59,389
of the Mujin Serial Murders.

869
01:06:02,230 --> 01:06:05,300
It's me, Jung Ba Reum.

870
01:06:06,730 --> 01:06:09,269
Yes, this mint smell.
It was you after all.

871
01:06:10,969 --> 01:06:12,769
I guess I killed the wrong person.

872
01:06:13,969 --> 01:06:17,110
No wonder Kim Joon Sung kept
his mouth shut until the end.

873
01:06:19,380 --> 01:06:20,510
It was because of you.

874
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:22,579
He wanted to save you.

875
01:06:24,150 --> 01:06:25,250
What an idiot.

876
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:29,789
Explain to me about the photo.

877
01:06:30,090 --> 01:06:31,829
How do you have it?

878
01:06:32,789 --> 01:06:34,130
Spare the boy first.

879
01:06:34,429 --> 01:06:37,159
- What?
- Han Guk who's below your feet.

880
01:06:39,670 --> 01:06:42,969
I see.
You're here to save him, aren't you?

881
01:06:44,269 --> 01:06:46,510
- And Bong Yi too?
- Let the boy go.

882
01:06:46,739 --> 01:06:47,840
I beg you.

883
01:06:49,010 --> 01:06:51,849
I'm sorry to say this, but it's too late.

884
01:06:52,849 --> 01:06:53,909
What?

885
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:57,789
Go Mu Chi lost the game.

886
01:06:58,019 --> 01:06:59,690
He passed the due time.

887
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:04,059
He must've been shocked to find stones
in his brother's stomach.

888
01:07:04,889 --> 01:07:07,730
That lame scumbag was too busy drinking
to look for the kid.

889
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:10,969
It's a shame. I agree.

890
01:07:11,769 --> 01:07:14,400
But what can I do? A promise is a promise.

891
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:19,170
I punished the kid
as soon as the time was up.

892
01:07:22,710 --> 01:07:24,710
Those who do not envy or get jealous...

893
01:07:25,449 --> 01:07:26,579
are sinners.

894
01:07:27,349 --> 01:07:29,179
You lunatic.

895
01:07:29,219 --> 01:07:31,150
That's it. That look.

896
01:07:32,489 --> 01:07:34,789
I love that look of rage.

897
01:07:36,190 --> 01:07:38,329
You are more than qualified...

898
01:07:39,289 --> 01:07:40,389
to serve me.

899
01:07:42,659 --> 01:07:43,829
By the way, are you here alone?

900
01:07:44,170 --> 01:07:45,369
No cops?

901
01:07:46,599 --> 01:07:49,570
- Why would you do that?
- To kill you with my own hands.

902
01:07:53,639 --> 01:07:55,539
Are you furious that I killed your friend?

903
01:07:56,010 --> 01:07:57,849
I know reporting you won't do anything.

904
01:07:58,550 --> 01:08:00,079
I must kill you with my own hands...

905
01:08:00,820 --> 01:08:03,320
before you do anything worse.

906
01:08:06,090 --> 01:08:07,250
What are you on about?

907
01:08:09,190 --> 01:08:10,320
Let me kill you.

908
01:08:12,130 --> 01:08:13,659
That's the best.

909
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:17,930
What's that look?

910
01:08:19,130 --> 01:08:20,229
You and I...

911
01:08:21,970 --> 01:08:24,000
are both pitiable.

912
01:08:25,539 --> 01:08:27,010
Pitiable?

913
01:08:27,739 --> 01:08:29,039
You pity me?

914
01:08:30,510 --> 01:08:31,680
Pitiable...

915
01:08:33,050 --> 01:08:34,520
You son of a...

916
01:08:44,529 --> 01:08:47,390
Say it again. You pity me?

917
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:55,670
I'm a deity. A deity.

918
01:08:56,569 --> 01:08:58,640
Why would you pity a deity?

919
01:08:59,239 --> 01:09:00,340
A deity?

920
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:04,310
You're a mere psychopath
with mutated genes.

921
01:09:52,689 --> 01:09:54,359
Die, you monster.

922
01:10:24,329 --> 01:10:26,029
- You and I...
- Sung Yo Han...

923
01:10:27,130 --> 01:10:29,560
was only trying to save
Han Guk and Bong Yi from me...

924
01:10:30,329 --> 01:10:32,170
when he was wrongfully killed.

925
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:36,170
So please stop pointing your fingers
at Sung Yo Han and his family.

926
01:10:41,380 --> 01:10:44,909
I don't know how to apologize
to the victims and their families.

927
01:10:45,779 --> 01:10:48,649
Please do not forgive me.

928
01:10:50,119 --> 01:10:52,920
Oh, deity. Please...

929
01:10:54,989 --> 01:10:56,960
don't forgive me.

930
01:11:20,649 --> 01:11:22,750
(It's me, Chi Gook.
Come visit me right now.)

931
01:11:26,590 --> 01:11:29,420
Many scars are visible
near this stab wound.

932
01:11:29,460 --> 01:11:30,989
Yes, and it's only that area.

933
01:11:31,590 --> 01:11:35,800
This means he resisted
while grabbing onto the knife.

934
01:11:36,029 --> 01:11:38,770
I was attacked from behind,
so I didn't see his face.

935
01:11:40,399 --> 01:11:41,470
It can't be.

936
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:44,640
He's lying.

937
01:12:05,329 --> 01:12:06,390
Chi Gook.

938
01:12:11,229 --> 01:12:12,699
How are you feeling?

939
01:12:20,869 --> 01:12:21,939
It was you.

940
01:12:30,149 --> 01:12:31,420
I want...

941
01:12:33,449 --> 01:12:35,390
I want to live happily with my mom.

942
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:37,989
That's all.

943
01:12:42,159 --> 01:12:43,229
So please...

944
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:46,399
turn yourself in.

945
01:12:47,939 --> 01:12:49,899
I pity that man, Sung Yo Han,

946
01:12:50,970 --> 01:12:52,109
who died instead of you.

947
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:56,140
I'm terrified.

948
01:12:58,010 --> 01:13:00,380
But I can't be selfish
and turn a blind eye to this.

949
01:13:00,909 --> 01:13:02,420
So you should do it.

950
01:13:03,250 --> 01:13:04,279
You.

951
01:13:06,250 --> 01:13:07,649
That way, we can all live.

952
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:24,869
Officer Jung.

953
01:14:35,079 --> 01:14:36,579
Chi Gook. Na...

954
01:14:39,350 --> 01:14:41,920
Doctor!

955
01:14:44,050 --> 01:14:46,050
Sir, are you okay?

956
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:07,069
Jung Ba Reum!

957
01:16:05,729 --> 01:16:09,899
(Next week, we'll look back on the murders
from Ba Reum's perspective as a predator.)

958
01:16:09,970 --> 01:16:12,310
(Please look forward to next week's
special episodes.)

959
01:16:13,369 --> 01:16:15,909
(Mouse)

960
01:16:15,979 --> 01:16:17,310
Open the door.

961
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:19,609
We should work together to find Han Guk.

962
01:16:22,649 --> 01:16:25,890
Gosh. It's not fun
since you're being like this.

963
01:16:25,949 --> 01:16:28,920
Come on out soon so I can have some fun.
