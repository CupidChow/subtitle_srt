It's too late for an abortion.

10
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:35,240
Then what? You want me to
give birth to a murderer?

11
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,379
It's for the best.

12
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,319
Kill me.

13
00:01:21,019 --> 00:01:22,390
Kill me quickly.

14
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:24,090
You're crazy.

15
00:01:30,859 --> 00:01:32,430
I'll kill you if that's what you want.

16
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:13,669
Why did you save me?

17
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,069
You should've left me.

18
00:02:17,539 --> 00:02:19,240
You should've let me die.

19
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,580
Why?

20
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,419
Give birth to that baby.

21
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,659
Why did you save me?

22
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:38,300
You should've let us both die.

23
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,729
- Another murder happened in Suseong.
- It's Suseong yet again.

24
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,199
Over the past 2 years,
10 serial murders...

25
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:46,199
The Suseong serial killer
was caught at last.

(Type O, cadmium detected, life sentence)

41
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:32,080
Why Bong Yi was released. You didn't ask.

42
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,949
Detective Shin found
the murder weapon right here.

43
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,259
It wasn't Bong Yi's knife,
but the real murder weapon.

44
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,219
The one used to castrate Kang Deok Soo.

45
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,129
That's why Bong Yi was cleared.

46
00:03:57,909 --> 00:03:59,439
- Yu Na?
- Yes.

47
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,210
He said he was sure
that she had seen something.

48
00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:04,650
What on earth did she see?

49
00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:06,949
There's no way she saw my face.

50
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,219
I have to make sure she won't meet Yu Na.

51
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,259
Hey, what brings you here?
We sent all the evidence.

52
00:04:13,729 --> 00:04:15,860
The clothes Bong Yi was wearing
when she was taken to the hospital...

53
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,329
are different from the ones she wore
in the dashcam footage of Ms. Choi's car.

54
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,199
Ms. Oh Bong Yi.

55
00:04:22,569 --> 00:04:23,939
Will you come to the police station?

56
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,310
What did you see?

57
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:32,740
It's you, isn't it?

58
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:48,589
Has Bong Yi said anything yet?

59
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:51,600
No. She's still refusing to say anything.

60
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,670
That will only put her at a disadvantage.

61
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:58,600
But we can't be sure
that her knife was the murder weapon.

62
00:04:58,769 --> 00:05:00,610
Shouldn't we keep looking
for more solid evidence?

63
00:05:00,769 --> 00:05:02,910
We searched everywhere around the river
but couldn't find anything.

64
00:05:03,009 --> 00:05:05,540
That day, there was a fast current
due to the heavy rain.

65
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:08,509
If something was swept away,

66
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:11,279
it probably moved along the outside bend
affected by centrifugal force,

67
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:14,649
and it might have stuck somewhere
down the river.

68
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:22,029
Yes, Mu Chi. I found it.

69
00:05:22,329 --> 00:05:24,029
It's hard to believe
that it was stuck here.

70
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:26,660
The universe helped us.

71
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:30,670
We found someone else's DNA
other than Kang Deok Soo's on that weapon.

72
00:05:31,769 --> 00:05:35,009
- Pardon?
- I just don't understand the result.

73
00:05:37,779 --> 00:05:40,279
I don't know what to think of this.

74
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,649
The DNA belongs to a prison inmate.

75
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:50,290
What? What do you mean by that?

76
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,819
The DNA found on the knife
used to stab Kang Deok Soo...

77
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,129
belongs to a person who is currently
serving time in prison.

78
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,160
Someone who's locked up in prison?

79
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:04,870
How is that even possible?

80
00:06:04,899 --> 00:06:08,209
That is why I'm baffled.

81
00:06:10,209 --> 00:06:11,980
I'm sure it was planted intentionally.

82
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:14,850
Intentionally?
You mean, the culprit did it? Why?

83
00:06:15,579 --> 00:06:16,649
You know why.

84
00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:18,480
He's mocking us.

85
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,319
By planting the DNA of a prison inmate...

86
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:25,589
who has an undeniable alibi,

87
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:30,230
he wanted to say, "You can't catch me
no matter how hard you may try."

88
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,899
I guess he wanted to show
his confidence to beat the police...

89
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:34,800
and make fun of us.

90
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,670
Do you really think...

91
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:42,069
that was the reason?

92
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:48,310
By the way, why do you care so much
about that bill?

93
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,819
No reason.

94
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,750
Bong Yi.

95
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,720
It's all over now.

96
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,160
You'll have only happy dreams from now on.

97
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,089
Oh, right. What is your dream?

98
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:03,759
My dream?

99
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:07,060
I haven't been able to have a dream
until now.

100
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,370
You should have one now.

101
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,899
One that excites you
and makes your heart quicken.

102
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,509
Did you always dream of becoming
a TV show director?

103
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:18,310
No. Someone else's dream...

104
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,910
became mine.

105
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:24,850
That being said, how about you
work on my team?

106
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,449
Me?

107
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:28,189
But...

108
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:30,990
I didn't even go to college.

109
00:07:31,019 --> 00:07:32,689
I couldn't even graduate
from high school either.

110
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,490
Your educational background
doesn't matter.

111
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:35,860
No.

112
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:37,759
I'm not qualified for it.

113
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,100
I can't do it.

114
00:07:41,569 --> 00:07:42,870
Call me if you change your mind.

115
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:48,740
I'll do that.

116

(Choi Hong Ju,
OBN's current affairs producer)

117
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:01,550
Why hasn't Yu Na come yet?

118
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:03,819
Did she go to the police?

119
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:07,259
No. I can't let that happen.

120
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:11,100
The phone is turned off.

121
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:13,329
There you are.

122
00:08:14,069 --> 00:08:15,470
I've been looking all over for you.

123
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,100
You see, I really need to see Yu Na.

124
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:20,439
But she... She's not here.

125
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:23,069
She moved to another house.

126
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:25,009
She moved out?

127
00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:30,550
She left a message for you.

128
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,919
Hi, Bong Yi.

129
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:35,120
I'm sorry for not saying goodbye
before leaving.

130
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:37,389
It's you, isn't it?

131
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,059
I saw this...

132
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:42,590
when you locked the door.

133
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:49,100
Thank you.

134
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:55,139
Had it not been for you,
I wouldn't be here now.

135
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,539
I would've died then.

136
00:08:59,809 --> 00:09:02,080
I'll keep the secret until I die.

137
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,019
I won't tell even my mom or Bong Yi.

138
00:09:07,549 --> 00:09:08,649
Pinky promise.

139
00:09:20,929 --> 00:09:22,830
I will forget everything.

140
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:26,169
Abracadabra.

141
00:09:29,309 --> 00:09:31,210
Thank you so very much.

142
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:55,299
I went to the police station to see you,

143
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:58,440
but the police officer said
I couldn't see you.

144
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,840
Mister, can I borrow your phone?

145
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,240
Hi, Bong Yi.

146
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,440
I'm sorry for not saying goodbye
before leaving.

147
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,549
I'm moving back to the neighborhood
I lived in before.

148
00:10:10,179 --> 00:10:11,250
Mom.

149
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,379
- I love my room.
- You do?

150
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,620
Yu Na, help me lift this up.

151
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,259
My mom promised me
that she will never drink again...

152
00:10:18,289 --> 00:10:20,360
and get treated for it.

153
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:23,289
- This one is yours...
- I'll go to school too.

154
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,759
I didn't have any dreams,
but I have one now.

155
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:29,230
When I grow up,
I will become like Oh Bong Yi.

156
00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:32,570
When I grow up,
I'll make sure to become like you.

157
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:35,509
Bong Yi is my forever hero...

158
00:10:35,539 --> 00:10:39,009
who is even greater than
Goat Man and Ladybug.

159
00:10:39,309 --> 00:10:41,980
- Bye, Bong Yi.
- Bye.

160
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,149
That's silly. I... I'm not a hero.

161
00:10:57,529 --> 00:11:00,360
I will become someone
that Yu Na can be proud of.

162
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:16,909
Do you call this a proposal?

163
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,879
What were you thinking?

164
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:22,120
Do your job properly as a newbie!

165
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:24,259
I'm sorry.

166
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,320
I tried my best, but...

167
00:11:28,289 --> 00:11:29,389
I'm sorry.

168
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,830
You can see a desk upon entering.

169
00:11:34,299 --> 00:11:35,500
That's where I work.

170
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:39,940
It stinks because it's right next to
the restroom.

171
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,710
So no one wants to sit there.

172
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,039
And it's always the newbie
that sits there.

173
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:49,309
Nevertheless, I love my desk.

174
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:51,149
Why?

175
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:53,620
Who cares it smells a little bad?

176
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:57,889
I'm just happy that I have a desk
at a TV station.

177
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:00,120
Are you that happy?

178
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,529
Of course.

179
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,629
It was my dream since I was a little girl.

180
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,200
To become a TV producer...

181
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,029
who is righteous,

182
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:12,240
always tells the truth,
and contributes to a fair society.

183
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,580
But I guess...

184
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,450
I won't be able to
make that dream come true.

185
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,279
That's not true.

186
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,950
We can get out of here alive.

187
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:31,990
Let's make it happen.

188
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:40,259
Let's do that.

189
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,669
Hyeon Soo, I promise you.

190
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,840
No matter what happens,

191
00:12:50,009 --> 00:12:51,840
I'll get you out of here.

192
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:58,220
I'm sorry.

193
00:12:59,419 --> 00:13:00,649
I wanted to...

194
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,620
make your dream come true for you.

195
00:13:05,289 --> 00:13:06,990
But I don't deserve to do that.

196
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:18,370
(Current Affairs Frame)

197
00:13:20,269 --> 00:13:21,409
Yes, Bong Yi.

198
00:13:21,669 --> 00:13:23,840
I'll do it. I'll take the job.

199
00:13:25,509 --> 00:13:27,440
I want to find a dream.

200
00:13:29,379 --> 00:13:30,580
What's with the long face?

201
00:13:31,049 --> 00:13:32,850
I thought everything was sorted out well.

202
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:37,720
I almost killed that little girl.

203
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,659
But you didn't.

204
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:43,360
That's because she promised me
she will never tell anyone.

205
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:47,730
That's just an excuse.

206
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:50,370
You couldn't kill her.

207
00:13:52,669 --> 00:13:54,210
I couldn't kill her?

208
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:00,379
I was sure you wouldn't kill her.

209
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:02,779
If you were going to kill her,

210
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,820
you'd have found a way.

211
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,190
Why?

212
00:14:08,789 --> 00:14:11,220
How were you sure I wouldn't kill Yu Na?

213
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:16,730
In your brain,
Jung Ba Reum and Sung Yo Han...

214
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:18,159
are still locked in battle,

215
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:21,269
but right now, your good nature is
suppressing the predator instinct.

216
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,039
I almost killed Hoon Seok.

217
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:31,179
And the cat I'm looking after.

218
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,350
That was the moment
your suppressed killer instinct awoke,

219
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:36,809
and it was the first time,
so you lost control.

220
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:39,279
You released that instinct to kill
through Kang Deok Soo.

221
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,149
Things will calm down for a while.

222
00:14:43,389 --> 00:14:44,690
"For a while"?

223
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:49,159
No one knows
when the next outburst will be.

224
00:14:52,929 --> 00:14:54,159
By the way,

225
00:14:55,299 --> 00:14:58,200
if it weren't to frame Bong Yi
for killing Kang Deok Soo,

226
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,669
why did you do what you did with him?

227
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:10,110
I wanted to punish him with the knife
Bong Yi's grandmother...

228
00:15:10,549 --> 00:15:11,980
had prepared to kill him with.

229
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:14,720
So I got it from
the Evidence Storage Room.

230
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,519
That's when I saw it.

231
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,730
(Leviticus Chapter 24)

232
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,940
"Anyone who takes
the life of a human being..."

233
00:15:36,009 --> 00:15:38,039
"is to be put to death."

234
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:41,080
"Fracture for fracture,"

235
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:44,519
"eye for eye, tooth for tooth."

236
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:48,750
The moment I read that,
I wanted to kill him the same way.

237
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,590
I think Sung Yo Han made gym director
Song Soo Ho read that before his death.

238
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,990
Those verses really stuck with me...

239
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,559
because of Sung Yo Han, right?

240
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,240
What ties did Sung Yo Han have
with Song Soo Ho...

241
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,809
that made him want to get revenge
in such a cruel manner?

242
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,610
He hit the man
until his cartilages wore out.

243
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:14,350
Then he burned him alive.

244
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:18,320
On top of that,
he put a knife through his heart.

245
00:16:26,659 --> 00:16:27,990
Did you talk to Lee Jae Shik?

246
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,259
Yes.

247
00:16:29,659 --> 00:16:32,129
He trembled and could barely speak.
Shock will do that to you.

248
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:36,600
His DNA was on the knife used to kill
Kang Deok Soo. He would be shocked.

249
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:37,940
Does he suspect anyone?

250
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,500
He could barely speak.

251
00:16:39,769 --> 00:16:41,000
But apparently,

252
00:16:41,539 --> 00:16:44,379
he shared a cell last year
with Kang Deok Soo.

253
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,009
Attention.

254
00:16:47,409 --> 00:16:50,279
Of all inmates
who had contact with Lee Jae Shik,

255
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:53,080
see if anyone who was released
is worth noting.

256
00:16:53,149 --> 00:16:56,320
There are inmates who shared cells with
Lee Jae Shik and Kang Deok Soo.

257
00:16:56,389 --> 00:16:59,220
See if any of them were released recently.

258
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,019
- Okay.
- Get to it.

259
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:06,130
- Your camera?
- Detective Kang said...

260
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,930
he'd return it by today.

(Muijin Serial Murders)

262
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,940
What's this? Why is she
putting this on air again?

263
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:26,980
I left it at the scene
while I helped Bong Yi.

264
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:29,490
The Special Task Force said...

265
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:32,119
they found nothing and said
they'd return the camera by today.

266
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,569
A car rushed at me without its headlights.

267
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:50,240
My bike fell down the bank
as I tried to avoid the car.

Officer Jung.

269
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:08,029
Detective Go. Why the sudden video call?

270
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,859
Well... Take a look at this for me.

271
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,960
You're always on a bike.

272
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,029
See what this is.

273
00:18:16,769 --> 00:18:18,170
What is this?

274
00:18:20,339 --> 00:18:23,539
That's a mini dashboard camera
GU Cam released.

275
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:27,480
It's really small,
so it's hot with the bikers.

276
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,480
But I don't think it's available yet.

277
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,549
So it's a dashboard camera for bicycles?

278
00:18:32,619 --> 00:18:34,619
- Yes.
- Got it.

279
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:41,329
Whose is it?

280
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,329
A bicycle?

281
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:11,920
Is it that bicycle?

282
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,420
If it had a dashboard camera,

283
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:16,990
it must've caught me.

284
00:19:30,309 --> 00:19:32,140
Hyung Shik. Get out here.

285
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,150
What do you want, Dad?

286
00:19:35,579 --> 00:19:38,119
He's asking about something on your bike.

287
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,279
What?

288
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,190
Are you the guy
who called about my listing?

289
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:44,819
I'm a power blogger, you see.

290
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:47,859
The manufacturer begged me to
test their product and comment on it.

291
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:50,460
The camera uploads footage
automatically, so it's really...

292
00:19:50,529 --> 00:19:53,200
- Where is it now?
- He's a detective.

293
00:19:53,529 --> 00:19:56,470
- Where is it?
- My bicycle's inside.

294
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:57,900
Come with me. This way.

295
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:17,390
Please find it for me.

296
00:20:17,789 --> 00:20:20,819
I bragged about it online, you see.

297
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,190
How did the thief know where I live?

298
00:20:23,259 --> 00:20:25,559
You saw it on your bike just an hour ago.

299
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:27,299
Yes, I did.

300
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,569
Did someone take it?

301
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,700
- Show me what you uploaded.
- Okay.

303

Anyone can tell it's this house.

304
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,819
Doesn't that look cool?

305
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,019
I'm also in a group of graffiti lovers.

306
00:20:48,089 --> 00:20:50,450
Are you trying to beg someone
to steal it from you?

307
00:20:50,619 --> 00:20:53,059
Are police allowed
to talk down to strangers like this?

308
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:56,660
If he stole it, he won't report it
even if it shows the killer's face.

309
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:59,500
What are you doing here?

310
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:03,329
Oh, I was... I was curious as well.

311
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,240
- You made it.
- Hello.

312
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:42,140
Will you join me to gather footage?

313
00:21:42,339 --> 00:21:43,369
Can I really?

314
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:57,390
Detective, did you catch
the dashboard camera thief?

315
00:21:57,589 --> 00:21:59,690
No. Darn it.

316
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:00,890
I knew it.

317
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,460
His guilty conscience is
stopping him from reporting the killer.

318
00:22:04,029 --> 00:22:06,230
Why did he steal that of all things?

319
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:12,000
What are you looking at?

320
00:22:12,069 --> 00:22:13,299
Lee Jae Shik's files.

321
00:22:13,769 --> 00:22:16,640
It's the inmate whose DNA we found on
Kang Deok Soo's murder weapon.

322
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:20,240
He assaulted and killed a man
who was about to...

323
00:22:20,509 --> 00:22:22,809
rape his daughter and got five years.

324
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:26,420
- Did he?
- Should he have just stood by...

325
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,619
while his kid got raped?

326
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:29,720
Our laws are stupid.

327
00:22:31,789 --> 00:22:34,289
They are. He must feel so wronged.

328
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:40,700
By the way, Lee Jae Shik
shared a cell with Kang Deok Soo.

329
00:22:41,529 --> 00:22:43,130
- What?
- He and Kang Deok Soo...

330
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,769
were both in Anyang Prison,

331
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:47,269
and six months ago,
he was transferred to Mujin Prison.

332
00:22:48,069 --> 00:22:52,210
But how is them sharing a cell...

333
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:55,380
related to Lee Jae Shik's DNA
being found on the murder weapon...

334
00:22:55,509 --> 00:22:56,750
of Kang Deok Soo?

335
00:22:57,079 --> 00:22:59,250
Kang Deok Soo was released
more than a year ago.

336
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:01,180
You have a point.

337
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,490
(Affidavit)

338
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:06,460
He graduated from a fashion school
and worked at a denim dyeing factory.

339
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:09,059
He worked hard.

340
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:11,660
How could they sentence him
to five years in prison?

341
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:15,329
But why did the killer plant his DNA?

342
00:23:16,769 --> 00:23:18,539
I think I should meet him in person.

343
00:23:21,869 --> 00:23:23,339
Detective Go, let me go with you.

344
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,980
Appeal for a new trial.

345
00:23:26,009 --> 00:23:29,150
That's possible only if you find
new evidence.

346
00:23:29,509 --> 00:23:31,349
I mean, the statute of limitations
has expired.

347
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,480
Why won't the real culprit
turn himself in?

348
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:35,089
So this wrongfully convicted man
can be freed.

349
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,950
(I am...)

350
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:43,059
I am fine now.

351
00:23:43,329 --> 00:23:45,000
You're not fine.

352
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,230
You said your daughter will get married
in a few days,

353
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,430
and that you were upset
that you won't be there.

354
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:50,529
Hey.

355
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:53,170
Inmate 5253, you have a visitor.

356
00:23:53,369 --> 00:23:56,839
Oh, right. People from a network
want to ask me about Kang Deok Soo.

357
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,339
I'll be back soon.

358
00:23:59,009 --> 00:24:01,710
- We're here to interview Lee Jae Shik.
- Just a moment.

359
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:05,380
Hey, Dong Goo.

360
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:08,890
Bong Yi, what are you doing here?

361
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:10,089
Dong Goo, have you been well?

362
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:13,660
- Ms. Choi, hello.
- I'm an assistant writer on her team.

363
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:14,829
Today is my first day.

364
00:24:14,859 --> 00:24:16,930
Really? How did you...

365
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:20,160
I get it. Ms. Choi helped you get the job.

366
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:22,700
I think you made a mistake.

367
00:24:22,829 --> 00:24:25,640
- She's only good at fighting.
- Got a death wish?

368
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:28,970
See? What kind of writer would use
such a vulgar expression?

369
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,869
Hey, I can knock you out with one blow.

370
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:32,809
You're dead meat.
You're not even good at fighting.

371
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:34,109
Are you here to cover a story?

372
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:35,849
Yes, I'm here to interview Lee Jae Shik.

373
00:24:36,009 --> 00:24:37,950
Oh, I see. Regarding Kang Deok Soo case?

374
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:40,680
That's right. Excuse me.
I have to fill out a form.

375
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,890
- Sure. Go ahead.
- Okay.

376
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:46,059
Dong Goo, what did that old man
come to prison for?

377
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,160
He looks like
a completely upright and ethical person.

378
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:52,859
- Well... The serial murders in Suseong...
- What?

379
00:24:53,299 --> 00:24:54,829
- Is he the killer?
- Quiet down.

380
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,029
My gosh. I got goosebumps. Look at this.

381
00:24:58,069 --> 00:24:59,200
It's not like that.

382
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,839
That's so unexpected.

383
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,910
- It's like "The Usual Suspects".
- Hey.

384
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:05,210
But why does he look like
such a kind person?

385
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,480
Bong Yi, it's time. Let's go.

386
00:25:06,509 --> 00:25:08,039
- Okay.
- Go on.

387
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:10,009
But... I'll call you later.

388
00:25:10,049 --> 00:25:11,079
Okay.

389
00:25:12,819 --> 00:25:13,880
- Bong Yi.
- Stop.

390
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,089
- Are you okay?
- No.

391
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:16,849
What's the matter?

392
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:18,789
What is it?

393
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:23,289
I'll carry this.

394
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:26,029
Let's go.

395
00:25:28,029 --> 00:25:29,829
Lee Jae Shik is an earnest man.

396
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,099
He has never caused any trouble
since he came here.

397
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,470
He's an exemplary prisoner.

398
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,069
He went through a lot.

399
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:37,769
He'll complete his sentence in a few days.

400
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:39,509
Can we meet him now?

401
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:41,980
Please wait a little while.

402
00:26:03,829 --> 00:26:05,539
He's doing an interview right now.

403
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,970
- An interview?
- I was shocked, obviously.

404
00:26:08,339 --> 00:26:10,839
I don't know why my DNA was on it.

405
00:26:11,109 --> 00:26:15,079
Right. I heard that Kang Deok Soo was
your cellmate.

406
00:26:15,109 --> 00:26:17,609
- Yes, just for a while.
- Hey, Oh Bong Yi.

407
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:19,450
- Oh, my. Mr. Go.
- Bong Yi.

408
00:26:19,779 --> 00:26:20,880
Ba Reum.

409
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:22,619
What are you doing here?

410
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:24,819
Actually, I started...

411
00:26:24,849 --> 00:26:26,059
Take Bong Yi out of here.

412
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:27,890
- Why?
- Wait outside.

413
00:26:34,299 --> 00:26:35,500
Why did she come here?

414
00:26:36,029 --> 00:26:37,599
She joined my team.

415
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:40,170
So you brought a kid into this place
full of criminals?

416
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,210
All right. Let's talk later.
I'm in the middle of an interview...

417
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,809
Did you put on this patch by yourself?

418
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,109
The one on your uniform.

419
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,849
Oh, that. Yes.

420
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,710
I went to a fashion school,

421
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,579
and I like making things like that.

422
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,619
Then did you also make the patch
on Kang Deok Soo's clothes too?

423
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:56,289
- I was interviewing him...
- I don't care about the show!

424
00:26:56,349 --> 00:26:58,720
Is that stupid show more important
than catching the murderer?

425
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:01,390
- You should keep your voice down.
- You're right about that patch.

426
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:04,829
I made the patch
on Kang Deok Soo's clothes.

427
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:07,059
I made a patch with some fabric scraps...

428
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:09,130
and put it on the clothes I bought
with the money kept in custody.

429
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:10,599
And he must have like it.

430
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,099
He kept coveting it.

431
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:15,109
Then he took it away from me
on the day he was released.

432
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:17,339
He said he would wear it on a special day.

433
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:18,910
On a special day?

434
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,509
So it was a special day for him?

435
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,980
That scum Kang Deok Soo.
I'm glad he got killed.

436
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:25,650
It should've been me who killed him!

437
00:27:25,819 --> 00:27:28,420
Why did Mr. Go get so mad?

438
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:32,890
It's because he cares so much about you.

439
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,059
He doesn't want you to see...

440
00:27:35,259 --> 00:27:37,130
the dark side of the world again.

441
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:41,700
Well... I'd like to ask you
about something.

442
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:43,730
What is it?

443
00:27:43,869 --> 00:27:45,299
It's about Mr. Go.

444
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,099
Did you like him before?

445
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:51,710
Well...

446
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,839
He held onto the clothes
that he took away...

447
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,849
from Lee Jae Shik
waiting for a special day.

448
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,210
He wore it for the first time that day.

449
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:59,420
That's why Lee Jae Shik's DNA
remained intact...

450
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:01,279
even when a year had passed.

451
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:04,190
And since he covered the knife he used
to stab Kang Deok Soo with the clothes,

452
00:28:04,289 --> 00:28:07,119
Lee Jae Shik's DNA was found on the knife.

453
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:09,059
It's possible if he stored it properly.

454
00:28:09,289 --> 00:28:12,630
But there's no trace of the killer
of Kang Deok Soo.

455
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:14,859
We're back to square one.

456
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:17,700
We wasted time
because of Lee Jae Shik's DNA.

457
00:28:25,309 --> 00:28:27,710
- I can't believe you're a writer.
- I wouldn't call myself that.

458
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:28,849
It's practically manual labor.

459
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,210
No one can beat you
when it comes to physical strength.

460
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:33,279
I'm sure you will win
all the awards given to a writer.

461
00:28:33,319 --> 00:28:36,849
If that's how it works, I would win
an award at the Academy Awards.

462
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:38,250
That sounds awesome too.

463
00:28:42,289 --> 00:28:44,730
By the way, that inmate...

464
00:28:44,829 --> 00:28:47,099
Did you see how worried he was
when he saw me falling?

465
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:49,569
I mean, I just got a scratch on my hand,

466
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:52,470
and bled a little, but he even teared up.

467
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,740
You bled? When did it happen?

468
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:58,579
- I'm fine.
- Gosh. Give me a break.

469
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:01,009
He said you reminded him of his daughter.

470
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:03,349
He also said that you look
so much like his daughter.

471
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:06,680
- Me?
- He asked me to check...

472
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,980
if you were fine.

473
00:29:08,019 --> 00:29:10,819
He was worried you might've thought of him
as a weird person.

474
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:14,190
He worries about how others think of him?

475
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,829
How could that kind of man
kill ten people?

476
00:29:16,859 --> 00:29:18,289
He didn't do that.

477
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:21,700
How can you be so sure
that he didn't do it?

478
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:24,299
Mr. Kim said...

479
00:29:25,569 --> 00:29:27,769
that he was tortured by the detectives,

480
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:29,809
so he had no choice but to make
a false confession.

481
00:29:30,109 --> 00:29:32,880
They told him to confess
to avoid the death penalty.

482
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:35,349
During his trial,
he revealed that he confessed...

483
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:37,880
as he was told
because of the harsh treatment.

484
00:29:38,049 --> 00:29:39,279
But that wasn't accepted.

485
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,880
Gosh. You're so gullible.

486
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,950
I mean, if he was actually innocent,

487
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,589
he could've appealed a motion
for a new trial.

488
00:29:44,619 --> 00:29:47,559
I heard that you can't do that
unless there's new evidence.

489
00:29:47,859 --> 00:29:49,660
It may be possible
if the case draws attention.

490
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:52,700
Who knows if new evidence surfaces?

491
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:56,569
Hey, Bong Yi, you should talk to people
at the network to air this case.

492
00:29:56,769 --> 00:29:59,539
If that's true, what did his family do?

493
00:29:59,569 --> 00:30:01,170
His daughter is his only family.

494
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,670
But he hasn't seen her in a long time.

495
00:30:02,869 --> 00:30:04,339
Don't you think she's too mean?

496
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:05,609
I mean, she's his daughter.

497
00:30:06,539 --> 00:30:07,779
It's because she's his daughter.

498
00:30:09,109 --> 00:30:11,349
She must've felt more betrayed
because she's his daughter.

499
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:14,720
She must have trusted him
more than anyone else.

500
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,400
I don't think those were fake tears.

501
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,069
I heard that you can't do that
unless there's new evidence.

Darn.

508
00:31:05,299 --> 00:31:08,369
We lost the story for next week
as the injunction request was granted.

509
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,009
Does anyone have an idea
for next week's episode?

510
00:31:11,509 --> 00:31:13,210
(Hello, Sherlock Hong Ju.)

511
00:31:14,579 --> 00:31:15,650
How about this one?

512
00:31:16,009 --> 00:31:18,250
This kid's classmate's grandmother...

513
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,220
has dementia... Dementia.

514
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:24,849
She was accused of killing
stray cats in the neighborhood.

515
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:26,859
Gosh. It's Great Detective Conan again.

516
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:28,390
Why doesn't this kid study?

517
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,289
The kid thinks of our website
as his own doodle book.

518
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:31,829
It's covered with his posts.

519
00:31:31,859 --> 00:31:33,230
Can you think of any other ideas?

520
00:31:43,339 --> 00:31:46,940
Then how about
the Suseong Serial Murder Case?

521
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:49,750
The man who claimed the police tortured
him to make him confess?

522
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:52,750
That's what the criminal says.

523
00:31:53,019 --> 00:31:54,450
Why did you bring that case up suddenly?

524
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:55,849
Do you have any particular reason?

525
00:31:56,119 --> 00:31:58,019
Well... No, it's not like that.

526
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:01,420
If he was falsely convicted
just as he claimed,

527
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:04,160
I hope that at least his daughter...

528
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:08,599
knows that her father is not a killer,

529
00:32:08,829 --> 00:32:10,269
but an innocent man.

530
00:32:10,329 --> 00:32:12,400
Is this show an online broadcast?

531
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:15,269
Do you think this network makes
shows for his daughter's sake?

532
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:18,140
I'm sorry.

533
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:22,180
All right. Let's take another day
to come up with an idea...

534
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:23,480
and discuss it again tomorrow.

535
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:24,650
Okay.

536
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,480
Thank you, everyone.

537
00:32:30,619 --> 00:32:31,750
I like the purpose of the show.

538
00:32:33,089 --> 00:32:37,190
"We want his daughter to know
that he's not the killer."

539
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:38,829
It's a good approach.

540
00:32:38,859 --> 00:32:40,660
- Really?
- But...

541
00:32:40,829 --> 00:32:44,170
How are you going to make her believe
that her father isn't the killer?

542
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:47,140
I'll find a way by any means.

543
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:49,369
Whatever it takes?

544
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:52,309
Okay. Whatever it takes?

545
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:54,710
- Tell me what you find.
- Okay.

546
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:02,849
I know she's a newbie,
but she knows no better.

547
00:33:03,019 --> 00:33:05,819
So what? I like how
she reminds me of when I started out.

548
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:10,990
1995...

549
00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:16,670
A rainy day.

550
00:33:26,579 --> 00:33:28,849
There's a limit
with the information that's online.

551
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:34,720
Is this where the evidence boxes are kept?

552
00:33:34,849 --> 00:33:35,920
Yes.

553
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:37,849
It's a huge room.

554
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:40,319
Are all the evidence from Korea in here?

555
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,390
It's not just evidence.

556
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:45,900
All the old handwritten case reports
are here too.

557
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:49,930
This place holds
the history of Korean crime.

558
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:53,799
Officer Jung, you have
a very important position.

559
00:33:54,569 --> 00:33:57,640
In what order are the boxes kept?

560
00:33:58,609 --> 00:34:00,910
They're shelved by year and case type.

561
00:34:01,009 --> 00:34:04,309
The serious crimes are over there,
and these are the familial murders.

562
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,279
And over here are the serials.

563
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,420
(Suseong Serial Murders 1,
Mujin Police Station)

564
00:34:13,019 --> 00:34:16,230
Bong Yi, we should go.
This is a restricted area.

565
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:20,929
I'm from Namu Station and would like to
show some evidence to a victim's family.

566
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,400
Let's see...

567
00:34:28,269 --> 00:34:29,309
My gosh.

568
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:31,309
Bong Yi.

569
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,880
- Were you here all night?
- Yes.

570
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:35,909
- And you read all these?
- Yes.

571
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,519
Hey. You need to get up.

572
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,150
- Wait.
- No.

573
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:44,889
- Something's strange.
- What's strange?

574
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:46,860
- The apple.
- What apple?

575
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,760
The expert said it was too familiar...

576
00:34:49,829 --> 00:34:51,429
for a first offense.

577
00:34:51,789 --> 00:34:55,300
But you said that first offenses
are bound to be clumsy.

578
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:58,699
- Yes.
- So I looked up all the murders...

579
00:34:58,769 --> 00:35:00,670
and attempted murders around Suseong.

580
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,000
And look at this.

581
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:04,440
Look at this.

582
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:06,139
This is an attempted murder
that happened...

583
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:07,880
in Guryeong two years before
the Suseong murders.

584
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:10,079
But if you look here,

585
00:35:10,579 --> 00:35:14,480
the culprit had captured a pregnant woman
and he ate an apple.

586
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:19,460
Apple pieces were found on
the bodies of the Suseong murder victims.

587
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:21,159
Well? Doesn't it sound similar?

588
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:23,829
Yes, it does.

589
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:27,400
But this guy was never caught.

590
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:29,230
No.

591
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:33,400
The Guryeong attempted murder suspect
could be the Suseong serial murders'...

592
00:35:33,469 --> 00:35:35,099
He could be the real killer.

593
00:35:36,369 --> 00:35:40,110
If that's true, then it's possible
Mr. Kim is innocent.

594
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:49,090
If he is innocent and was framed,

595
00:35:50,219 --> 00:35:51,349
do you want to correct it?

596
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,489
Isn't that obvious?

597
00:35:53,989 --> 00:35:57,460
He was in prison for over 20 years
for what he didn't do.

598
00:35:57,889 --> 00:35:59,599
Of course, he needs to get
released immediately.

599
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,909
If Inspector Park finds out
I let you have copies of the files,

600
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:13,039
he'll have me fired.

601
00:36:13,179 --> 00:36:16,949
You did a good thing
for a great cause. Good on you.

602
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:18,710
- My dear friend.
- Look at this.

603
00:36:19,179 --> 00:36:21,750
At the site of
the 10th Suseong serial murder,

604
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:24,420
they found five hairs
that didn't belong to the victim.

605
00:36:24,789 --> 00:36:26,860
The hairs were analyzed,

606
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:28,889
and they came out as type O.

607
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,590
They also detected
a large amount of cadmium.

608
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:35,059
At the time, the police focused on...

609
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:39,099
the nearby Seokpo smelting factory
that released large amounts of cadmium.

610
00:36:39,369 --> 00:36:42,039
They assumed
one of the workers was the killer.

611
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:45,610
At the time, Mr. Kim Bong Cheol...

612
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:47,710
worked at that factory.

613
00:36:48,179 --> 00:36:49,949
His blood is type O,

614
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:53,219
and his home was located within 10km...

615
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,550
of all the murder sites.

616
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:58,289
And all the killings
happened on the nights that...

617
00:36:58,349 --> 00:36:59,820
Kim Bong Cheol worked late.

618
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:03,929
But the National Forensic Service
wasn't as advanced then as it is now.

619
00:37:03,989 --> 00:37:05,599
We can't trust the results completely.

620
00:37:05,699 --> 00:37:07,960
Plus, is Mr. Kim the only type O guy...

621
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:09,670
who was exposed to cadmium?

622
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:11,769
Exactly. That's my point.

623
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:15,070
But Mr. Kim's confession
put the nail in his coffin.

624
00:37:15,809 --> 00:37:17,469
And he was given a life sentence.

625
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:21,039
He insisted in
his second and third trial...

626
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:25,309
that the police coerced him
into confessing,

627
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:27,050
but it wasn't accepted.

628
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:30,849
Basically, you need new evidence
to get him a retrial.

629
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:34,119
We have to find something new.

630
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:40,400
The Guryeong attempted murder.

631
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:43,170
If we're right, the victim of that case...

632
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:46,199
is the only survivor of
the Suseong serial murders.

633
00:37:46,769 --> 00:37:49,639
- Yes.
- Shouldn't we talk to her, then?

634
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,039
How?

635
00:37:51,909 --> 00:37:53,840
Ba Reum will find her.

636
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:56,079
I will? But that's...

637
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:59,650
an address from 26 years ago,
so she won't be easy to find.

638
00:38:03,719 --> 00:38:06,659
Okay. Let's start with that address.

639
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:08,389
- Thank you.
- Yes!

640
00:38:09,429 --> 00:38:11,630
Officer Jung!

641
00:38:20,739 --> 00:38:22,440
Hello.

642
00:38:23,809 --> 00:38:25,570
Are you Ms. Sung Jin Ah?

643
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:32,550
- Who are you?
- I'm from the TV station.

644
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:41,489
Just a moment.
My house is a mess. Wait here.

645
00:38:41,559 --> 00:38:42,659
Okay.

646
00:38:48,429 --> 00:38:49,769
Hello.

647
00:38:52,269 --> 00:38:53,869
You're so cute.

648
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:18,989
Why would someone from
a TV station visit me?

649
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:24,329
I was looking into something
and had a few questions.

650
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:26,139
If you don't mind,

651
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:30,869
could you tell me in detail
what happened to you in 1995?

652
00:39:31,769 --> 00:39:33,340
In 1995?

653
00:39:34,179 --> 00:39:37,909
You were abducted by a man.

654
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:39,780
That incident.

655
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:42,719
Why do you suddenly
want to know about that?

656
00:39:42,889 --> 00:39:46,559
Actually, I have doubts about...

657
00:39:46,989 --> 00:39:50,030
the Suseong serial murders
and am looking into it.

658
00:39:50,289 --> 00:39:52,500
The Suseong serial murders?

659
00:39:53,829 --> 00:39:55,969
Wasn't the killer caught long ago?

660
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,869
Yes, that's true.

661
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:02,739
Do you think
there's a connection between...

662
00:40:02,809 --> 00:40:06,579
the Suseong serial murders
and what happened to me?

663
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,710
Not exactly.

664
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:11,079
I just want to check a few things.

665
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:14,079
If you don't mind, could you...

666
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:16,150
explain in detail what happened to you?

667
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:27,800
At the time, I was nine months pregnant.

668
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:30,469
I was on my way home.

669
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,940
It's for the best.

670
00:40:35,369 --> 00:40:36,710
Kill me.

671
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:39,639
Kill me quick.

672
00:40:39,739 --> 00:40:41,039
You're crazy.

673
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,949
I'll kill you if that's what you want.

674
00:40:43,409 --> 00:40:44,610
That's all.

675
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:47,449
He was in a soldier's uniform,

676
00:40:47,619 --> 00:40:49,550
and he ate an apple.

677
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:54,489
Did you notice any other characteristics?

678
00:40:57,889 --> 00:40:59,659
No. Nothing else.

679
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:04,599
When I saw the news about
the Suseong murders,

680
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:08,039
I noticed the similarities
and wondered if my case was related.

681
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:10,710
So I told the police about it.

682
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:14,179
Did the Suseong case detectives visit you?

683
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:17,579
Yes. In case the perpetrator was
the same person,

684
00:41:17,909 --> 00:41:19,949
I told them everything I'd seen.

685
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:23,789
They said they understood,
but they never called back,

686
00:41:23,849 --> 00:41:27,119
so I assumed the cases were unrelated.

687
00:41:27,559 --> 00:41:29,289
They left out that detail on purpose.

688
00:41:29,489 --> 00:41:33,099
Did you find the person
who saved you that night?

689
00:41:34,199 --> 00:41:35,300
No.

690
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:37,670
He wasn't from our neighborhood.

691
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:41,840
He was from elsewhere
and was hard to find.

692
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:44,139
I told him to kill me quickly,

693
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:47,440
and he cursed me out and called me crazy.

694
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:49,909
Okay. Let's go with this.

695
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:51,579
I'll get our chief's permission.

696
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:54,780
Not bad, Oh Bong Yi.

697
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:56,219
Thank you.

698
00:41:57,449 --> 00:41:59,050
- Are you that pleased?
- Yes.

699
00:41:59,619 --> 00:42:02,630
I owe it to you. You found her for me.

700
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:07,130
- Why did she say that?
- Say what?

701
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:09,730
She was heavily pregnant and almost due.

702
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:12,300
Why did she ask to be killed?

703
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:14,699
Shouldn't a pregnant woman...

704
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:18,739
plead even more for her life
to save her unborn baby?

705
00:42:20,739 --> 00:42:21,940
Why did she say that?

706
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:27,320
Perhaps there's a reason
we don't know about.

707
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:29,250
Even so.

708
00:42:30,519 --> 00:42:32,690
I just don't get it.

709
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:34,960
Hello?

710
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,929
What? Sorry, Ba Reum.

711
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,599
Why? Why can't we do it?

712
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,900
It's a case from long ago
that was already ruled upon,

713
00:42:42,969 --> 00:42:46,570
and digging into it could upset the cops,
prosecutors, and court.

714
00:42:47,099 --> 00:42:49,809
He said we wouldn't be able
to handle that.

715
00:42:51,239 --> 00:42:52,909
What are they so afraid of?

716
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:56,809
If they're so confident, what's it to them
whether we cover this or not?

717
00:42:57,510 --> 00:43:00,079
The police, the prosecutors, the judges,

718
00:43:00,179 --> 00:43:02,849
and those in the showbiz are all the same.

719
00:43:03,019 --> 00:43:05,219
They only care
about their vested interests.

720
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:08,360
The innocent will suffer
all by themselves.

721
00:43:09,559 --> 00:43:10,690
Darn it.

722
00:43:11,059 --> 00:43:12,159
Is it that upsetting?

723
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:14,360
If it turns out that he's truly innocent,

724
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:16,670
I'd feel terrible...

725
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:18,269
for him.

726
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:24,210
Covering his story won't change anything.

727
00:43:24,969 --> 00:43:26,079
Still,

728
00:43:27,309 --> 00:43:30,679
at least his daughter would believe him.

729
00:43:41,659 --> 00:43:45,230
I promise to obtain more government funds
to treat the elderly...

730
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:46,630
who suffer from dementia.

731
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:49,630
The new mayor.
The mayor who brings about change.

732
00:43:49,869 --> 00:43:52,940
I'm number eight, Shin Sung Min.

733
00:44:07,949 --> 00:44:09,590
Gosh, please leave.

734
00:44:09,849 --> 00:44:11,219
No interviews here.

735
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:12,789
Why did you push me?

736
00:44:13,159 --> 00:44:15,860
Reporter Song, hello.

737
00:44:16,329 --> 00:44:19,289
Hey. You're that guy
who received brain surgery.

738
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:23,369
I did hear that you were working again,
but I didn't know it was here.

739
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,670
I'm in the Evidence Storage Team.

740
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:27,300
What brings you here?

741
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:30,639
I was wondering if you guys found
anything regarding Kang Deok Soo.

742
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:35,010
Did you hear anything?

743
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:39,280
While organizing the murder files,

744
00:44:39,619 --> 00:44:41,250
I did come across something.

745
00:44:42,219 --> 00:44:43,750
No way. Are you seeing this?

746
00:44:43,789 --> 00:44:45,349
The future daughter-in-law
of Candidate Shin Sung Min...

747
00:44:45,389 --> 00:44:47,519
turned out to be
the Suseong serial murderer...

748
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:49,389
Kim's daughter.

749
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:51,860
For 2 years from 1997,

750
00:44:51,889 --> 00:44:54,659
Kim had murdered ten women
in gruesome ways...

751
00:44:54,699 --> 00:44:57,869
and had put the entire country in fear.

752
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,230
Yes, I knew.

753
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:02,440
I had a crush on Da Seul
ever since we were in university.

754
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:06,079
Then one day, I asked her to marry me.

755
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,480
That's when she suddenly wanted
to break up.

756
00:45:09,579 --> 00:45:12,250
I begged and asked her why.

757
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,849
That's when she told me...

758
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:16,989
that her father...

759
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:20,360
was the one responsible
for the Suseong Serial Murders.

760
00:45:23,889 --> 00:45:25,460
Did your parents know as well?

761
00:45:25,929 --> 00:45:28,599
Yes. I tell my father everything,

762
00:45:28,929 --> 00:45:30,130
so he knows.

763
00:45:37,909 --> 00:45:39,780
That's his father.

764
00:45:40,539 --> 00:45:42,639
Yes, she is our future daughter-in-law.

765
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:44,210
What should I have done?

766
00:45:44,579 --> 00:45:46,880
Tell my son to leave her?

767
00:45:47,349 --> 00:45:49,150
She's a good, lovely kid.

768
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:51,320
The children are always innocent.

769
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:55,519
She's been in pain all this time.

770
00:45:56,090 --> 00:45:57,590
I don't ask for your blessing,

771
00:45:58,030 --> 00:45:59,800
but please don't bash her.

772
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,059
It's a go.

773
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:04,500
He said yes since the Suseong Murders
is the most-searched keyword...

774
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:06,400
and everyone is talking about how
the killer's daughter...

775
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:08,670
is the future daughter-in-law
of Candidate Shin.

776
00:46:09,539 --> 00:46:11,869
He promised to defend us
no matter the pressure.

777
00:46:11,969 --> 00:46:13,980
It's so hectic here
since we're preparing for the show.

778
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:18,280
I feel bad for Detective Shin,
but it is what it is.

779
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:20,150
His misfortune became a blessing to me.

780
00:46:20,179 --> 00:46:21,750
I'm glad. Congratulations.

781
00:46:22,889 --> 00:46:24,190
Good luck, Bong Yi.

782
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:41,239
Is the owner of the blue toothbrush...

783
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:43,010
your next target?

784
00:46:46,179 --> 00:46:48,079
I should brace myself
before Sung Yo Han's instincts...

785
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:49,849
awaken.

786
00:46:50,449 --> 00:46:52,579
Who in the world is he?

787
00:46:53,679 --> 00:46:56,489
How will I catch that rat?

788
00:46:57,820 --> 00:47:00,360
I need to catch him
before he kills someone else.

789
00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:14,000
(Case Report
on Kang Deok Soo's Castration)

790
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:17,610
(This case seems to be related
to Kang Deok Soo's mother's suicide.)

791
00:47:19,610 --> 00:47:21,110
(Suicide Case of Kang Deok Soo's Mother)

792
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:38,429
Yes. He took those pants from me.

793
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:42,659
What about this? This was Kang Deok Soo's.

794
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:44,570
I don't recognize that.

795
00:47:45,469 --> 00:47:49,070
I didn't sew that patch
on the back of the sleeve.

796
00:47:50,739 --> 00:47:51,809
What?

797
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:54,639
So the killer did plant the DNA.

798
00:47:54,679 --> 00:47:56,280
Today, we will talk...

799
00:47:56,309 --> 00:47:59,579
about a cold case from 26 years ago.

800
00:48:00,019 --> 00:48:02,579
This case had occurred
in Guryeong in 1995.

801
00:48:02,619 --> 00:48:04,250
It had occurred immediately
after Han Seo Joon,

802
00:48:04,289 --> 00:48:05,889
the Headhunter, was caught.

803
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,760
Han Seo Joon had caught
all of our attention,

804
00:48:08,789 --> 00:48:11,489
so no one was interested
in this cold case.

805
00:48:11,929 --> 00:48:14,760
First, let's listen to the testimony
of the survivor...

806
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:16,199
who had successfully escaped.

807
00:48:17,369 --> 00:48:21,739
I was wearing knee-high stockings
and socks on top.

808
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:23,239
He took them off...

809
00:48:23,269 --> 00:48:25,510
and tied my hands behind my back
with them.

810
00:48:25,739 --> 00:48:28,940
He took out an apple
and a pocket knife from his backpack...

811
00:48:29,010 --> 00:48:30,550
and ate it in front of me.

812
00:48:30,849 --> 00:48:33,519
He had cut them
into crescent-shaped pieces.

813
00:48:33,719 --> 00:48:37,590
I can still vividly remember the shape.

814
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:40,190
That's right. Stockings and apples.

815
00:48:40,219 --> 00:48:43,030
These signatures were found
with all ten victims...

816
00:48:43,059 --> 00:48:45,989
of the Suseong Serial Murders.

817
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:48,800
We've also found another signature...

818
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,300
that hadn't been revealed.

819
00:48:50,369 --> 00:48:52,530
Let's listen
to the medical examiner's testimony.

820
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:56,469
I remember the shape of the apple pieces
because it was unique.

821
00:48:56,769 --> 00:48:59,210
They were crescent-shaped pieces.
Every single one of them.

822
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:01,610
The shape of the apple pieces
the woman saw in Guryeong...

823
00:49:01,639 --> 00:49:02,980
were also crescent-shaped.

824
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:04,949
Coincidence?

825
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:06,750
Let's listen to her testimony again.

826
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:09,019
I told him to kill me quickly,

827
00:49:09,050 --> 00:49:10,789
and he cursed me out...

828
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,050
and called me crazy.

829
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:14,889
He also said he'd kill me
if that's what I wanted.

830
00:49:15,889 --> 00:49:18,590
Kim, who's incarcerated
after being found guilty...

831
00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:20,559
for the Suseong Serial Murders...

832
00:49:20,829 --> 00:49:23,599
was born deaf and has a speech impediment.

833
00:49:23,769 --> 00:49:27,570
But this culprit heard what she said
and called her crazy.

834
00:49:27,869 --> 00:49:29,869
He even said he'd do her the favor.

835
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:32,239
If he was deaf
and had a speech impediment,

836
00:49:32,269 --> 00:49:34,110
how could he have heard her...

837
00:49:34,139 --> 00:49:36,039
and replied?

838
00:49:36,309 --> 00:49:38,980
According to the witness
of the Guryeong cold case,

839
00:49:39,050 --> 00:49:41,719
the culprit was a man in his 20s
who wore a military uniform.

840
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:45,349
However, Kim was in his 40s at that time,

841
00:49:45,389 --> 00:49:46,519
so it doesn't match.

842
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:49,059
What if the culprit
of the Guryeong cold case...

843
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:52,289
and that of the Suseong Serial Murders
are the same person?

844
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:53,829
Why did you save me?

845
00:49:54,329 --> 00:49:55,659
You should've let me die.

846
00:49:55,730 --> 00:49:56,929
Who was he?

847
00:49:57,969 --> 00:49:59,199
Who was he...

848
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:03,000
that he saved me and just left?

849
00:50:03,039 --> 00:50:05,239
Based on our investigation,
the experts have stated...

850
00:50:05,269 --> 00:50:07,139
that the NFS report from back then...

851
00:50:07,179 --> 00:50:09,809
is full of errors and that Kim's hair...

852
00:50:09,849 --> 00:50:13,320
wasn't a match with the hair
found back then.

853
00:50:13,349 --> 00:50:16,420
It has been confirmed
that there were many factories,

854
00:50:16,449 --> 00:50:19,119
excluding the one Kim used to work at,

855
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:23,429
where cadmium could've been detected

856
00:50:23,889 --> 00:50:26,090
Near the fourth crime scene...

857
00:50:26,130 --> 00:50:30,230
and the seventh crime scene,
the smelting factory where Kim worked at,

858
00:50:30,469 --> 00:50:31,599
is an accessory factory.

859
00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:34,440
This other factory is distant
from the crime scene,

860
00:50:34,469 --> 00:50:36,969
but cadmium could be detected
from this factory as well.

861
00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:38,869
It was a jean-dyeing factory.

862
00:50:39,409 --> 00:50:41,409
Jean-dyeing factory.

863
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:43,280
Cadmium.

864
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:46,480
Current age, mid 40s?

865
00:50:49,050 --> 00:50:50,190
Let's see.

866
00:50:54,289 --> 00:50:56,630
Lee Jae Shik.

867
00:50:56,659 --> 00:50:57,659
(Affidavit)

868
00:50:57,690 --> 00:50:59,460
Suseong Serial Murders.

869
00:51:02,699 --> 00:51:04,670
Jean-dyeing factory.

870
00:51:09,769 --> 00:51:13,610
Even if Kim is found innocent
and the real killer is identified,

871
00:51:13,909 --> 00:51:15,579
- he will not be punished.
- What's this?

872
00:51:16,849 --> 00:51:18,809
That is because
the statute of limitations has expired.

873
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:22,179
Perhaps, the police, the prosecutors,
and the court...

874
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:24,349
gave the real killer extra time...

875
00:51:24,389 --> 00:51:26,519
- No way.
- by framing an innocent man...

876
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:30,030
- 112.
- and ultimately set him free.

877
00:51:30,929 --> 00:51:33,760
I wonder how much the reward is
if I handed this over...

878
00:51:33,829 --> 00:51:35,530
to the broadcast station.

879
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:37,530
Good work.

880
00:51:37,570 --> 00:51:40,000
- Good work.
- Good work.

881
00:51:40,199 --> 00:51:42,199
- They loved it.
- Good work.

882
00:51:42,369 --> 00:51:44,510
- Good job.
- You too.

883
00:51:49,110 --> 00:51:50,780
(Restricted Number)

884
00:51:52,349 --> 00:51:53,250
Yes?

885
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:56,320
Who?

886
00:52:00,719 --> 00:52:02,159
Mr. Go!

887
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,559
Bong Yi, what brings you here?

888
00:52:05,059 --> 00:52:06,530
Did you watch the show?

889
00:52:06,599 --> 00:52:09,000
I did. Officer Jung told me.

890
00:52:09,199 --> 00:52:10,300
I'm proud of you.

891
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:13,599
I didn't do anything.
It was all Ms. Choi's work.

892
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,469
Here.

893
00:52:16,639 --> 00:52:17,639
What is this?

894
00:52:17,739 --> 00:52:21,510
I heard you'll be hosting
Detective Shin's wedding.

895
00:52:21,710 --> 00:52:24,480
I was worried you'd wear that
to his wedding.

896
00:52:24,550 --> 00:52:26,010
What's wrong with this?

897
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:28,119
Why are you being so nice to me?

898
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:31,050
What do you mean?

899
00:52:31,449 --> 00:52:33,090
Just because.

900
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:36,219
Now that I got a job,
I'll be getting a salary.

901
00:52:36,929 --> 00:52:39,230
By the looks of it, I doubt
I'll be getting fired anytime soon.

902
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,800
So I just spent
a few months' worth of my pay.

903
00:52:42,730 --> 00:52:44,829
I was just grateful
for everything you've done.

904
00:52:44,969 --> 00:52:47,500
Gosh. My gosh.

905
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:48,900
Oh, no.

906
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:52,440
What do you think?
Don't I look better than Officer Jung?

907
00:52:52,769 --> 00:52:54,610
No. That's not true.

908
00:52:56,139 --> 00:52:58,079
You're totally crazy in love.

909
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:01,380
Bong Yi.

910
00:53:01,449 --> 00:53:04,820
Officer Jung seems to like you a lot.

911
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:09,289
I'm so relieved and reassured
that such a kind man is by your side.

912
00:53:10,159 --> 00:53:12,360
Your grandmother must've sent him to you.

913
00:53:15,630 --> 00:53:16,929
You deserve to be finally happy.

914
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:21,000
Only show her how happy you are.

915
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:22,469
Okay?

916
00:53:24,070 --> 00:53:25,110
Okay.

917
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:26,369
Good.

918
00:53:26,809 --> 00:53:29,710
Yes, she's...
Ms. Choi, can you answer this?

919
00:53:29,949 --> 00:53:31,510
- Okay.
- He has something to tell you.

920
00:53:31,579 --> 00:53:32,650
- Really?
- Yes.

921
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:35,550
Choi Hong Ju speaking.

922
00:53:37,289 --> 00:53:38,389
Really?

923
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:40,460
Then let's meet.

924
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:42,659
Can you give me your phone number?

925
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:45,429
Okay.

926
00:53:46,929 --> 00:53:48,630
Please come here by 7pm.

927
00:53:48,829 --> 00:53:50,329
I'll let the reception desk know.

928
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:53,300
He has a video regarding Kang Deok Soo...

929
00:53:53,369 --> 00:53:55,739
that'll turn the world upside down.

930
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,010
He says it's a scoop.

931
00:53:58,139 --> 00:54:00,380
I'll be running late today
because of an interview.

932
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:03,239
You should meet him instead.

933
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:06,409
Don't get your hopes up, though.
We often get calls like this.

934
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:09,920
The viewers loved our show.
How do you feel?

935
00:54:11,090 --> 00:54:13,119
It feels surreal,

936
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:16,760
but it does feel great
since they're interested.

937
00:54:16,829 --> 00:54:18,929
- Good work.
- Thank you.

938
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:20,159
No problem.

939
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:22,599
The police are giving a briefing.

940
00:54:27,139 --> 00:54:30,510
Your daughter must've watched the show.
She came to visit you right away.

941
00:54:32,869 --> 00:54:34,440
Don't be tense.

942
00:54:35,610 --> 00:54:37,650
Make sure you tell her that you love her.

943
00:55:15,550 --> 00:55:18,949
We carried out an internal investigation
and didn't find any flaws...

944
00:55:19,019 --> 00:55:20,760
in the investigation
of the Suseong Serial Murders.

945
00:55:21,519 --> 00:55:24,059
Despite there being no correlation
between the Guryeong cold case...

946
00:55:24,130 --> 00:55:27,329
and the Suseong Serial Murders,

947
00:55:27,530 --> 00:55:30,769
"Sherlock Hong Ju" made it seem like
they were connected...

948
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,130
and put the entire country into chaos.

949
00:55:32,170 --> 00:55:33,130
Therefore, we express our regrets.

950
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:35,900
We are willing
to reinvestigate the case...

951
00:55:35,969 --> 00:55:37,909
if we find any new evidence.

952
00:55:41,909 --> 00:55:44,010
He had worked here for about two years.

953
00:55:44,909 --> 00:55:47,980
The Suseong Serial Murders happened
around here.

954
00:55:48,579 --> 00:55:50,989
Don't get me started.
I was interrogated as well.

955
00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:52,320
What about him?

956
00:55:52,449 --> 00:55:54,119
He was one of the suspects,

957
00:55:54,190 --> 00:55:56,960
but we were both let go
because our blood types weren't a match.

958
00:56:02,130 --> 00:56:03,500
"While assaulting the man..."

959
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:04,969
"who had attempted to rape
his stepdaughter,"

960
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:06,199
"he accidentally..."

961
00:56:06,269 --> 00:56:07,539
(Lee regained consciousness
and called the police.)

962
00:56:07,639 --> 00:56:09,039
She's his stepdaughter?

963
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,510
(3-98 Miri-dong)

964
00:56:11,909 --> 00:56:13,440

965
00:56:18,010 --> 00:56:20,519
The person you have reached is not
available. Please leave a message.

966
00:56:24,949 --> 00:56:27,460
Hey, Sang. I have a favor to ask.

967
00:56:27,519 --> 00:56:30,960
Lee Jae Shik has a daughter.
Find out her home address.

968
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:37,369
You've gone through a lot.

969
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:38,969
Thank you, sir.

970
00:56:39,769 --> 00:56:41,539
Let's grab a drink
if we ever meet outside.

971
00:56:41,639 --> 00:56:44,170
I'd love that. Good luck.

972
00:56:44,869 --> 00:56:45,909
Thank you.

973
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:19,909
Late at night,
I woke up to go to the bathroom.

974
00:57:20,510 --> 00:57:21,940
You weren't home.

975
00:57:22,710 --> 00:57:24,280
I waited for you,

976
00:57:25,010 --> 00:57:27,079
and you came home a while after.

977
00:57:28,719 --> 00:57:30,789
Your entire body was drenched in blood.

978
00:57:31,619 --> 00:57:33,320
There was mud...

979
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:36,059
and grass on your pants.

980
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:39,829
The next day,

981
00:57:42,159 --> 00:57:43,869
I saw the news,

982
00:57:44,969 --> 00:57:47,199
and they said the tenth victim...

983
00:57:47,639 --> 00:57:48,969
was found near our house.

984
00:57:51,309 --> 00:57:52,409
I couldn't tell...

985
00:57:55,179 --> 00:57:56,610
anyone about it.

986
00:58:02,050 --> 00:58:03,150
Are you serious?

987
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:05,989
So if I tell the truth,

988
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:07,719
he'll stay incarcerated forever?

989
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:13,159
Does that mean we no longer need
to run away?

990
00:58:14,030 --> 00:58:15,059
That's right.

991
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,400
Lee Jae Shik was the one
who had attempted to rape me.

992
00:58:19,570 --> 00:58:21,940
The guy I had a fling with saw us...

993
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,469
and came to save me.

994
00:58:23,909 --> 00:58:25,010
And then...

995
00:58:25,170 --> 00:58:28,280
That punk hit him with a brick.

996
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:34,849
You should've told the truth sooner.

997
00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:36,250
I was terrified.

998
00:58:36,889 --> 00:58:39,889
He threatened to kill
my mom and me if I told the truth.

999
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:41,719
I was petrified.

1000
00:58:44,690 --> 00:58:46,789
Excuse me, but is Lee Jae Shik...

1001
00:58:47,199 --> 00:58:49,329
the real killer
of the Suseong Serial Murders?

1002
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:51,599
Dong Goo, where is Lee Jae Shik right now?

1003
00:58:51,730 --> 00:58:53,639
He was just released. Why?

1004
00:58:53,739 --> 00:58:55,269
Darn it!

1005
00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:00,010
Where could he have gone to?

1006
00:59:00,710 --> 00:59:01,880
Where?

1007
00:59:05,909 --> 00:59:08,519
Detective Shin,
wasn't there an undeveloped area...

1008
00:59:08,579 --> 00:59:09,679
among the crime sites
of the Suseong Serial Murders?

1009
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:11,019
Hold on.

1010
00:59:11,150 --> 00:59:14,920
Here it is. It's Jomyeong-ri Park
where the 8th and 10th victims were found.

1011
00:59:14,989 --> 00:59:16,889
- That place is still untouched.
- Jomyeong-ri Park?

1012
00:59:31,269 --> 00:59:34,409
He said he'd come by 7pm. Where is he?

1013
00:59:38,679 --> 00:59:40,719
Sir, have you seen Ms. Choi?

1014
00:59:40,849 --> 00:59:42,519
She left a while ago to cover a story.

1015
00:59:53,530 --> 00:59:54,599
Hello?

1016
00:59:55,429 --> 00:59:56,530
An accident?

1017
00:59:56,599 --> 00:59:58,469
He's being taken
to the Mujin University Hospital.

1018
00:59:59,230 --> 01:00:01,340
I see. Okay.

1019
01:00:05,969 --> 01:00:07,539
He's from our neighborhood.

1020
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:12,179
He has a video regarding Kang Deok Soo
that'll turn the world upside down.

1021
01:00:14,650 --> 01:00:15,880
Mr. Go?

1022
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:20,519
He was letting us know beforehand
that Lee Jae Shik was his next target.

1023
01:00:20,619 --> 01:00:22,289
That darn psychopath.

1024
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,159
This one.

1025
01:00:31,099 --> 01:00:32,469
He's a predator as well.

1026
01:00:34,139 --> 01:00:35,239
That's...

1027
01:00:38,170 --> 01:00:39,340
What's going on?

1028
01:00:39,739 --> 01:00:41,739
Detective Go is a predator?

1029
01:00:47,349 --> 01:00:48,420
What are you looking for?

1030
01:00:49,150 --> 01:00:52,019
The culprit's toothbrush
was in the list of evidence.

1031
01:00:52,389 --> 01:00:53,920
I can't find it.

1032
01:00:57,329 --> 01:00:58,360
Is that so?

1033
01:00:59,429 --> 01:01:00,460
What kind of case was it?

1034
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:02,000
Severe assault.

1035
01:01:02,329 --> 01:01:05,230
It's not a murder case,
but I must find it.

1036
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:08,340
Oh, I see.

1037
01:01:10,409 --> 01:01:11,909
I'll help you look for it.

1038
01:01:12,570 --> 01:01:14,440
It's a blue toothbrush.

1039
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:23,280
Is this it?

1040
01:01:23,949 --> 01:01:25,050
Did you find it?

1041
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:28,960
- Is this it?
- Yes, you're right.

1042
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:31,760
That's it. There it was.

1043
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:34,199
Thank goodness.

1044
01:01:34,630 --> 01:01:35,960
You saved me.

(Chunju Police Station)

1046
01:01:41,369 --> 01:01:43,969
If he had accidentally killed the man
while trying to save...

1047
01:01:44,039 --> 01:01:45,610
his stepdaughter from her rapist,

1048
01:01:46,210 --> 01:01:47,940
then he couldn't have been a predator.

1049
01:01:48,909 --> 01:01:52,909
In 1997, he moved to Suseong
after finding a job.

1050
01:01:53,110 --> 01:01:56,349
After living there for 8 years,
he moved to Chunju in 2005.

That's when Lee Jae Shik worked
in Suseong.

1061
01:02:25,650 --> 01:02:28,920
I feel bad that Mr. Kim
was wrongly accused and incarcerated.

1062
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:38,329
Dong Goo, can you get a strand
of Mr. Kim's hair?

1063
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:42,800
The NFS is re-examining
all the cold case evidence.

1064
01:02:43,159 --> 01:02:46,869
You said you didn't think
he was the real killer.

1065
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:51,239
That's why I wanted to submit
his DNA and the evidence.

1066
01:02:52,409 --> 01:02:54,510
Will this be enough?

1067
01:02:54,610 --> 01:02:56,440
I'll ask.

1068
01:02:56,780 --> 01:02:59,010
But I can't guarantee anything
since this isn't a cold case.

1069
01:02:59,909 --> 01:03:00,949
Okay.

1070
01:03:01,079 --> 01:03:04,090
By the way, did I leave my necktie here
when I was drunk?

1071
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:07,889
Oh, that? There were bloodstains,
so I took it to the dry cleaner's.

1072
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:09,360
I'll give it back tomorrow.

1073
01:03:09,389 --> 01:03:10,559
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

1074

- Let me know when the results are out.
- I will.

1075

Thanks!

1076
01:03:28,010 --> 01:03:29,079
Can you analyze this?

1077
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:37,690
This person has normal DNA.

1078
01:03:45,829 --> 01:03:48,360
Can you collect the DNA
from these bloodstains?

1079
01:03:49,059 --> 01:03:50,429
Please plant it here.

1080
01:04:04,110 --> 01:04:07,320
It took you long enough to get released.

1081
01:04:08,380 --> 01:04:10,150
Please spare me.

1082
01:04:10,789 --> 01:04:12,090
Spare you?

1083
01:04:13,050 --> 01:04:15,289
I'm sure all of your victims
said the same thing.

1084
