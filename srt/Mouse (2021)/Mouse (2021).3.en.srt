Yes.

13

But he was excluded right away.

14
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:55,590
Yes. Well, actually,
the kid was so suspicious,

15
00:00:55,659 --> 00:00:59,329
so unofficially, we did a polygraph.

16
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,929

don't show on polygraphs?

What? Are you saying
the kid's a psychopath?

Oh, I didn't mean that.

You failed to catch the culprit,

I saw you on TV a while back.

Yes. I was asked to give an interview,

44

Slashing the throat will be quicker
than stabbing the side.

The carotid runs through here,
so blood will pour out like a fountain.

92
00:08:28,149 --> 00:08:30,410
I visited her to ask about her son's case.

93
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:32,649
That's when I found her in the reservoir.

94

You're going to catch a cold.

Gosh, you're completely drenched.

96
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,639
She's stable now, but you do know...

97
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:59,980
that she has repetitively
attempted suicide, right?

98
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,980
She'll do it again soon.

99
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:05,250

100
00:09:08,049 --> 00:09:11,190
Thank goodness you found her.

101
00:09:11,389 --> 00:09:12,490
I don't need it.

102
00:09:13,389 --> 00:09:15,759
Why not? Does it stink?

103
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,399
- Yes.
- Really?

104
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,779
I've only worn it for two weeks.

105
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:36,110
Darn it!

106
00:09:36,149 --> 00:09:39,220
Make sure you have three meals a day.
And quit drinking.

107
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:53,759
Poor Soo Jung.

108
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:57,269

00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:12,750
Oh, dear.

111
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:29,029
You do know that she has repetitively
attempted suicide, right?

112
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,500
She'll do it again soon.

113
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:53,590

- Bye.

114
00:10:58,059 --> 00:11:00,000

115
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,370
- Did you go somewhere?
- Yes.

116
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,200
I couldn't attend your final mass.

117
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,340
So I visited the church,
but you weren't there.

118
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,870
Goodness.

119
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:12,039
It's obvious he dropped off
some food at his brother's.

120
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:14,350
The detective, right?

121
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,809
Right. How is Chi Gook doing?

122
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:19,049
Well, he's still unconscious.

123
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:23,049
The residents gathered and had
a group prayer session today,

124
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:24,419
so he will wake up.

125
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:26,259
Of course.

126
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:28,659
When will you move to Yirye-dong?

127
00:11:29,059 --> 00:11:30,159
Tomorrow.

128
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:33,529
I'll be coming here for a few more days
since I haven't packed up everything yet.

129
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,230
- Get on. I'll drop you off.
- Okay.

130
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:38,570
- Right. Officer Jung.
- Yes?

131
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,740
What was it again?
Didn't you need us to sign a form...

132
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:43,240
- for strengthening the patrol?
- Right.

133
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:46,340
My husband stays home on Sundays,
so go get his signature.

134
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,809
- Is he home?
- Yes.

135
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,110
He's not drunk, is he?

136
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,820
- Sit here. I'll be quick.
- Okay.

137
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:01,230
Mu Chi.

138
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,730
I told you not to leave this stuff.

139
00:12:05,299 --> 00:12:07,159
How many times do I need to tell you
that I've cut ties with you?

140
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,500
But we're brothers.

141
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,399
If Mom and Dad know about this...

142
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,340
How dare you mention them?

143
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:19,409
Mu Chi. Please.

144
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,409
I've thought about this...

145
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,450
countless times.

146
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,149
And I still can't understand you.

147
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,559
How could you forgive the scumbag...

148
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,559
who killed our parents
and made you disabled?

149
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:34,759
How?

150
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:37,429
You jerk.

151
00:12:37,899 --> 00:12:40,529
I hate you more than
that scumbag, Han Seo Joon.

152
00:12:41,629 --> 00:12:44,200
Won't you be too ashamed
to meet our parents again?

153
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,539
Other than the four items
that belonged to the victims,

154
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,669
a watch was also found at the crime scene.

155
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:51,840
The police believe
there is an additional victim.

156
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:53,379
Father. Father!

157
00:12:54,009 --> 00:12:55,080
It's not him.

158
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,750
What do you mean? It's not him?

159
00:12:57,779 --> 00:13:00,080
Chi Gook's watch was found at
the site of a murder.

160
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,220
You know, the vineyard murder scene.

161
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,720
What? Whose watch?

162
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:10,899
It's the one, isn't it?

163
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,970
How many times do I need to repeat myself?

164
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:25,379
I stabbed him because
he looked down on the Headhunter.

165
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,610
You stripped him naked
except for his underwear.

166
00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:28,850
What did you do with his clothes?

167
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:32,250
I said I burned them all.
I'm sure it's written in there.

168
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,720
And the weapon used?
You couldn't have burned that.

169
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,720
I won't tell you. Look for it yourself.

170
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:40,960
Let me see how competent the police are.

171
00:13:41,059 --> 00:13:43,190
I'm pretty sure you can't tell me...

172
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,960
since it wasn't your doing.

173
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,000
I said I stabbed him.

174
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,200
So you're saying you also killed
the gym director,

175
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:56,570
the female employee, the homeless person,
and the female university student?

176
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:59,809
That's impressive given the fact
that you're behind bars.

177
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:01,580
What are you talking about?

178
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:04,980
This watch, that belongs
to your victim, Na Chi Gook,

179
00:14:05,019 --> 00:14:06,980
was found on the student's wrist.

180
00:14:07,049 --> 00:14:09,250
How was that possible?

181
00:14:09,289 --> 00:14:10,789
Could this watch have legs?

182
00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:13,490
Hold on. Are these actually legs?

183
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:18,259
Did you think owning up
to something you didn't do...

184
00:14:18,299 --> 00:14:19,799
would win Han Seo Joon's favor?

185
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,730
Run along and kiss that monster's feet.

186
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:33,580
- Move the patient to a room.
- Yes, Doctor.

187
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:39,720
- Hello?
- Mr. Sung Yo Han?

188
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,149
Who is this?

189
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,419
You're Han Seo Joon's son, right?

190
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:48,190
I need to speak with you
regarding the recent cases.

191
00:14:53,929 --> 00:14:55,399
Sure, I'll see you then.

192
00:14:56,769 --> 00:14:57,870
Listen carefully.

193
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:01,470
We have yet to find the victim's clothes
and the weapon used.

194
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:03,570
Up until now, we only searched
the inside of the penitentiary.

195
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:05,440
But starting today, we will also search...

196
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:10,049
all the areas outside
where outsiders have access.

197
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,179
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

198
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:12,620
Let's go.

199
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:16,720
Detective, if outsiders were able
to come and go as they wished,

200
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,559
don't you think he would've taken
the weapon with him?

201
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:21,830
The security was strict
with what the outsiders carried,

202
00:15:21,889 --> 00:15:23,559
so I doubt that's the case.

203
00:15:24,059 --> 00:15:26,529
It's highly likely that it's still here.

204
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:28,730
I get why you want to get the weapon.

205
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:31,769
But why are you so adamant
about finding his clothes?

206
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:35,370
Up until now, he has never
stripped his victims.

207
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:37,610
The fact that he stripped
Na Chi Gook means...

208
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:40,279
there's crucial evidence on his clothes.

209
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:52,259
(Lead with Love)

210
00:15:55,889 --> 00:15:58,159
What? How did you do that?

211
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,570
There's a mirror
that's positioned diagonally.

212
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:04,399
A person will be hiding behind the mirror.

213
00:16:04,669 --> 00:16:08,669
But to the audience, the mirror
would look empty because...

214
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:12,639
I get it. So he appeared
where it should've been empty?

215
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:14,309
That means he was already
in there from the get-go.

216
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:17,210
If an adult male was inside,
it must've been quite heavy.

217
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,279
But you didn't notice?

218
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,980
This box itself is
quite heavy to begin with.

219
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,490
Even if a 100kg person was inside,

220
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,220
it'd still be easy to move the box...

221
00:16:25,259 --> 00:16:27,159
- The wheels are custom-made.
- Go inside.

222
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,990
Me? Okay.

223
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:38,470
1, 2, 3.

224
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:44,940
Done.

225
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,610
You'll come to see our performance, right?

226
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:48,549
No. I don't think I can make it.

227
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,750
I was asked to help with paperwork.

228
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:52,480
Dong Goo will probably feel bad.

229
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,720
Make up with him later, okay?

230
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:57,519
I'll do that. Good luck.
Don't get intimidated.

231
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:59,419
- All right. See you later.
- See you.

232
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,230
I think it was almost noon.

233
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:04,700
I put it in this corner
as soon as I came in.

234
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:06,730
So it wouldn't be in the way
of the members.

235
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,099
Did you ever leave it unattended?

236
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:11,670
Not once except when I was on stage.

237
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:13,940
But all the other members were
on the stage with me then.

238
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,069
Oh, I forgot that
I left once to have lunch.

239
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,339
Oh, right.

240
00:17:19,009 --> 00:17:20,480
Did everyone go?

241
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:23,309
Yes. I was told to hurry up...

242
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:26,180
because the cafeteria was about to
close, so I took everyone there.

243
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,720
I also checked if everyone was there.

244
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,049
How long were you gone?

245
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:32,819
About 30 minutes excluding the time
to walk there and come back.

246
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:35,259
We drank coffee too after eating lunch.

247
00:17:36,329 --> 00:17:38,660
Aren't there any security cameras in here?

248
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:41,869
This place is also used
as a dressing room for visitors.

249
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:43,200
So we received some complaints.

250
00:17:45,369 --> 00:17:46,470
Let me watch it.

251
00:17:46,539 --> 00:17:48,609
What time did the crew members
arrive at the cafeteria?

252
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:51,240
It was after the prison officers
finished eating lunch,

253
00:17:51,339 --> 00:17:53,210
- so I think it was around 1pm.
- There. Stop.

254
00:17:54,009 --> 00:17:56,009
It says 1:10pm. 1:10pm.

255
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:58,019
When did they leave?

256
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:03,750
Stop. Slowly.

257
00:18:05,589 --> 00:18:07,420
1, 2, 3...

258
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:12,299
Stop.

259
00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:14,869
1:40pm.

260
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,000
It took them 30 minutes to finish eating.

261
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,039
20 minutes from the auditorium
to the cafeteria and back.

262
00:18:26,109 --> 00:18:28,210
30 minutes for eating.
So it's 50 minutes in total.

263
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,950
That's long enough for him
to commit the crime...

264
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,279
and put the victim in the box.

265
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,769
We're looking for the victim's navy blue
inmate uniform and a knife.

266
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:08,410
What is he looking at?

267
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,519
Why are you still here?
I told you to leave a while ago.

268
00:20:13,619 --> 00:20:14,890
You said that the killer...

269
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:18,220
placed the body where you can see
a cross and gave it the finger...

270
00:20:18,289 --> 00:20:19,990
because the killer hates deities.

271
00:20:22,529 --> 00:20:23,930
But Chi Gook was different.

272
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:25,730
Why make an exception?

273
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:27,829
I don't understand that either.

274
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,450
Come on.

275
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:50,019
Hey, get back up. Come on.

276
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:52,619
Good.

277
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,349
What's wrong?

278
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:23,119
Are you all right?

279
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:43,440
I've heard a lot about you from Father Go.

280
00:21:43,509 --> 00:21:45,880
But I haven't met you in person before.

281
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:49,680
Do you think we haven't met before?

282
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,250
Pardon me?

283
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:52,779
What happened to that bird?

284
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:54,480
A bird?

285
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:56,319
Got a death wish?

286
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,450
Oh, it was you.

287
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,259
I'm sorry. You must've been startled.

288
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,190
That bird is still at my house.

289
00:22:03,259 --> 00:22:04,799
It will fully recover soon.

290
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,059
That's a darn lucky bird.

291
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,329
It would've died a long time ago
if it had been me who found it.

292
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,069
Oh, my.

293
00:22:13,569 --> 00:22:16,240
Father Go bragged about you so much.

294
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:18,740
He said that you are
such a great, righteous,

295
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:20,410
- and competent detective...
- Don't talk about him.

296
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:22,579
That being said,

297
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:25,950
I want to learn from you.

298
00:22:26,819 --> 00:22:29,420
- What?
- Can you include me in the investigation?

299
00:22:32,789 --> 00:22:35,630
I want to be of any help in catching
the man who hurt Chi Gook.

300
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:37,690
You said you're a police officer, right?

301
00:22:37,829 --> 00:22:40,829
Yes. I work at Gudong Substation.
I'm still new.

302
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:43,599
Do you think
that catching a serial killer...

303
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:46,869
is the same as patrolling
around a neighborhood?

304
00:22:47,339 --> 00:22:49,910
I know that it's not the same,
but whenever I think of Chi Gook,

305
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,980
I don't think I should just
sit around and do nothing.

306
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:55,480
Have you ever met a psychopath?

307
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,309
Pardon?

308
00:23:01,049 --> 00:23:03,019
They're beyond whatever you may imagine.

309
00:23:03,789 --> 00:23:07,759
They're terrifying monsters that
a naive man like you can't even imagine.

310
00:23:08,789 --> 00:23:10,690
A man like myself
who has nothing to lose...

311
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,259
and who is filled with rage
must handle that kind of scum.

312
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:28,450
(Gudong Martial Arts Gym)

313
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:35,920
Why are you so late?

314
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,019
You said you'd go to the library,
but you went to the comic book cafe?

315
00:23:43,829 --> 00:23:45,099
It's none of your business.

316
00:23:46,099 --> 00:23:47,829
How's your hand? Did you get better?

317
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:51,539
Why is your hand so cold?

318
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:53,700
Do you have a death wish?

319
00:23:55,869 --> 00:23:57,539
I can't let you go home like this.
Let's go.

320
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:58,910
To where?

321
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,980
- Just come with me.
- Where are you taking me? Let me go.

322
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:03,880
Can't you just follow me quietly?

323

- Darn it.
- What? You can't say it?

488
00:34:59,239 --> 00:35:00,699
Let's see.

489
00:35:00,869 --> 00:35:03,510
- What's trashy Reporter Yang's number?
- Fine, call him.

490
00:35:03,539 --> 00:35:04,840
Report all about it.

491
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,679
Where are you going?

492
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:07,909
To catch a psycho.

493
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:16,019
- Detective Go.
- Why aren't you on duty?

494
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:18,489
Chi Gook's mother needs to rest,

495
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:21,389
so Dong Goo and I relieve her
whenever we can.

496
00:35:26,699 --> 00:35:29,800
They think he lost his finger
trying to fend off his attacker.

497
00:35:30,269 --> 00:35:32,570
Two got sliced off and
they managed to sew one back on.

498
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,199
The other we retrieved too late.

499
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,739
We missed out on the timing.

500
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:44,949
Why would he show us Chi Gook's watch...

501
00:35:45,619 --> 00:35:47,980
and allow the police...

502
00:35:48,519 --> 00:35:49,690
to close in on him?

503
00:35:51,989 --> 00:35:52,989
I wonder.

504
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:55,019
Judging by the number
of injuries he suffered,

505
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:57,230
the killer must've thought he was dead.

506
00:35:57,289 --> 00:35:58,630
It's a miracle that he survived.

507
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:01,400
The doctor who had performed
the surgery will know the details.

508
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:03,400
Have you gotten in touch
with Dr. Sung Yo Han?

509
00:36:03,469 --> 00:36:05,300
No, not yet.

510
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:08,469
Give me a call when he comes in.

511
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,139
Sure.

512
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:18,679
Which room is Ms. Oh Mi Soon,
the one from yesterday, staying in?

513
00:36:31,829 --> 00:36:33,360
You demotivated me.

514
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:37,429
I'm jumping through hoops
to catch your son's killer,

515
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,570
so what is this?

516
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:48,010
I told you that
I'd catch him at all costs.

517
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:49,710
You should stay alive to witness it.

518
00:36:50,909 --> 00:36:52,010
So why...

519
00:36:53,349 --> 00:36:56,690
Do this one more time,
and I'll give up on catching him.

520
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:58,289
Would you like that?

521
00:37:02,289 --> 00:37:03,889
Catch him, Detective Go.

522
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,159
No, I won't.

523
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:09,469
I'll kill him.

524
00:37:10,969 --> 00:37:13,170
So don't try to kill yourself.

525
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:21,710
Okay. Kill him.

526
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,309
You must.

527
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:29,519
Good work today. I'll see you tomorrow.

528
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:31,519
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

529
00:37:31,889 --> 00:37:33,489
- I can't believe it.
- It's finally over.

530
00:37:33,559 --> 00:37:34,889
I'm so nervous.

531
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,829
- I'm so excited.
- Hey, she's sleeping again.

532
00:37:38,059 --> 00:37:40,000
- Again?
- My mom told me...

533
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,059
- not to hang out with her.
- Why?

534
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:43,730
It's obvious, isn't it?

535
00:37:44,699 --> 00:37:46,039
Anyway...

536
00:37:46,099 --> 00:37:48,139
- What do you want to eat?
- Let's have tteokbokki.

537
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:50,010
- Okay.
- I'm hungry.

538
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:51,309
- I'm hungry.
- I'm so excited.

539
00:37:51,539 --> 00:37:53,380
It's going to be awesome!

540
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:55,710
- We sync so well.
- I agree.

541
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:57,980
I'm so hungry.

542
00:38:02,349 --> 00:38:03,619
- Right.
- Right.

543
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:14,860
What?

544
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,170
Look at you.

545
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,920
Officer Jung brought it over.

546
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:34,719
He said you liked it.

547
00:38:35,789 --> 00:38:37,619
He's unbelievable.

548
00:38:37,789 --> 00:38:39,460
I never said such a thing.

549
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,690
Tell him to come back right away
and take that thing.

550
00:38:41,889 --> 00:38:44,230
It's already burdensome
to take care of myself.

551
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:47,329
That little brat
has such a horrible temper.

552
00:39:10,949 --> 00:39:13,559
What a clean freak.

553
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,059
Bong Yi, what brings you here?

554
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,659
Is this you?

555
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:22,670
Yes.

556
00:39:23,769 --> 00:39:25,800
Your mother is such a beauty.

557
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:36,880
Have you been getting bribes?

558
00:39:36,909 --> 00:39:38,610
How do you live in
such a huge house by yourself?

559
00:39:40,219 --> 00:39:42,820
I got it with my parents'
death insurance payout.

560
00:39:44,989 --> 00:39:46,219
Do you want something to drink?

561
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:53,559
Thanks for Eo Beong Yi.

562
00:39:55,429 --> 00:39:57,929
You seemed to like it so much
this morning.

563
00:39:59,869 --> 00:40:00,969
Be a good mother.

564
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:06,409
I'm sure you were very flustered
by what I said back at that restaurant.

565
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:10,550
What? Well...

566
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:12,179
I was just joking,

567
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:14,849
but I don't think you took it that way.

568
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,489
It was a joke, wasn't it?

569
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:18,550
I thought you seriously meant it.

570
00:40:18,619 --> 00:40:20,860
- I was afraid I had hurt you.
- Hurt?

571
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:22,929
Me?

572
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:25,090
Don't be ridiculous.

573
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:29,599
Anyway, I felt really bad about it.

574
00:40:30,329 --> 00:40:33,699
So I decided to cook something for you.

575
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,869
- You cooked this?
- Try it.

576
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:39,110
No, let me.

577
00:40:39,179 --> 00:40:41,639
I'm the one who made it for you,
so please just eat it.

578
00:40:42,809 --> 00:40:44,880
Ba Reum, open wide.

579
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:47,579
"Ba Reum"?

580
00:40:49,349 --> 00:40:50,590
Sure.

581
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,219
How is it?

582
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,730
- It's good.
- Is it?

583
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:00,199
- What is it?
- Isn't it obvious?

584
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,530
It's spicy stir-fried chicken.

585
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:03,869
- I see.
- Try it again if it's that good.

586
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:11,010
How's the meat so tender?
It's scrumptious.

587
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:13,280
- Right? Isn't Eo Beong Yi tasty?
- Yes.

588
00:41:13,809 --> 00:41:17,050
Not only is it cute,
but it's tender and tasty.

589
00:41:20,179 --> 00:41:21,519
Eo Beong Yi?

590
00:41:21,719 --> 00:41:24,989
What do you say? Aren't I just adorable?

591
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:40,940
Eo Beong Yi.

592
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,210
I told him the chicken was you,

593
00:41:44,269 --> 00:41:46,440
and that fool totally fell for it.

594
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:49,449
It felt great.

595
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:55,050
At times like that,

596
00:41:55,349 --> 00:41:58,820
I guess he looks a little bit cute.

597
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:03,530
Mu Chi! Where is he?

598
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:06,230
We're in huge trouble. Come here.

599
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:10,329
A police officer committed
an unbelievable act...

600
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,429
of eating away the crime scene evidence.

601
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:15,469
This evidence was found
at the vineyard murder scene.

602
00:42:15,539 --> 00:42:17,710
- Darn it. Who told them?
- It was found...

603
00:42:17,809 --> 00:42:19,340
- Who was it?
- alongside the belongings...

604
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:22,309
- Who ratted this out?
- of the other victims.

605
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,150
In addition, we also found out
that the police had attempted...

606
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:26,880
- to keep this a secret.
- "OBN..."

607
00:42:26,949 --> 00:42:29,690
"OBN News"? Doesn't Ms. Choi work...

608
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:35,420
You punk. Don't accuse someone
without any proof.

609
00:42:35,789 --> 00:42:37,030
She's not that type.

610
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:39,530
I never liked her ever since
she came and went by this place...

611
00:42:39,559 --> 00:42:41,059
as she wished.

612
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:44,070
Let's say she did.
But she's still not to blame.

613
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:46,769
It was wrong of us to try
to conceal it from the get-go.

614
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,769
That's why we have a bad reputation.

615
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,539
That... That little...

616
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:54,710
Gosh, he's the reason I'll go bald.

617
00:42:55,679 --> 00:42:59,579
How dare you report that
just because I didn't listen to you?

618
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:05,989
The person you have reached
is not available.

619
00:43:06,059 --> 00:43:08,219
So you won't pick up my calls?

620
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:32,579
What are you doing here?

621
00:43:37,519 --> 00:43:39,860
I was worried sick
because I couldn't get hold of you.

622
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:45,389
What is it? Is something wrong?

623
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:47,199
I'm scared.

624
00:43:48,699 --> 00:43:49,900
I'm scared.

625
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,039
- What is it?
- Wait.

626
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,539
Let's stay like this for a while.

627
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:15,159
Let's go on a date, Detective Go.

628
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:16,860
This is the murder scene
in the field of reeds in Seongjin-dong.

629
00:44:16,929 --> 00:44:18,889
- What?
- Let's date.

630
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:26,969
I've never seen a woman ask
a guy out at a crime scene before.

631
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:30,539
- No.
- No? Why not?

632
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:32,340
You're not my type anyway.

633
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:37,079
You just made me feel so small.
Am I not worth considering even for a bit?

634
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:38,309
No.

635
00:44:39,349 --> 00:44:40,719
You're terrible.

636
00:44:41,019 --> 00:44:42,280
You're good at identifying the culprits,

637
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,519
but you have no idea
what a great woman I am.

638
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:49,019
You're going to regret this for sure.

639
00:45:13,519 --> 00:45:15,320
Did you find Han Seo Joon's son?

640
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:17,449
I'll make sure
his son lives with pain too.

641
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:20,659
The same pain caused by the horrific
memory that I can never forget.

642
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,619
I'll make his son live with that pain too.

643
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,800
What are you pondering about?

644
00:45:34,139 --> 00:45:35,199
What is it?

645
00:45:59,059 --> 00:46:00,329
(Geumsin-dong, Byun Soon Young)

646
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:04,670
(Time of death: between midnight and 1am,

No, it's a murder case.

702
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:07,719
It's just that the body hasn't been found.

703

The higher-ups want to
keep it confidential.

The higher-ups?

705
00:49:11,019 --> 00:49:14,090
The missing person is
Professor Daniel Lee.

706
00:49:14,289 --> 00:49:16,190
You know him, right?
He was nominated for Nobel Prize.

707
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:19,230
He came to clean the area
before the opening time as always.

708
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:21,599
Everything else was turned off
except for this.

709
00:49:21,929 --> 00:49:24,070
Only this Ferris wheel was spinning.

710
00:49:31,639 --> 00:49:34,840
So he came closer to check it
and saw this mess.

711
00:49:36,179 --> 00:49:38,510
How did you find out
that this blood belongs to Professor Lee?

712
00:49:38,550 --> 00:49:41,219
We found a vehicle
near this amusement park.

713
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,750
It turned out to be the rental car
that Professor Lee rented...

714
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:45,550
that day through the hotel
he was staying at.

715
00:49:45,590 --> 00:49:48,090
So we compared the DNA
that we found in the driver's seat...

716
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:51,360
and the one in the blood we found here.
And they were a match.

717
00:49:51,389 --> 00:49:53,699
- But the body was gone?
- Correct.

718
00:49:57,570 --> 00:50:00,539
The fact that he was here
after the place closed means...

719
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,840
that he met someone here in secret.

720
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:08,579
What's this? It looks like a zipper.

721
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:10,179
We found it in the Ferris wheel car.

722
00:50:10,309 --> 00:50:11,909
I think it's a zipper on a jacket.

723
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:13,849
So we checked
the security footage at the hotel.

724
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:16,150
But Professor Lee was
wearing a suit that day.

725
00:50:16,219 --> 00:50:17,920
So I figure that it fell off
from the culprit's jacket.

726
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:19,320
Where's this hotel?

727
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:21,289
This way.

728
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:27,159
We checked everything,
but there was no sign of forced entry.

729
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:49,179
Can you rewind this for me?

730
00:50:54,159 --> 00:50:55,289

from school for bullying.

I'm begging you. So please...

746

- forgive her just this once...
- What are you doing now?

747
00:51:51,179 --> 00:51:53,179

Apologize to them sincerely.

- I don't want to eat anything.

for a change, and you don't want to eat?

You must be so nervous.

807
00:56:08,039 --> 00:56:09,769
Don't you worry.

808
00:56:10,639 --> 00:56:13,539
Granny will deal with it for you.

809
00:56:15,239 --> 00:56:17,750
The day you come out is the day you die.

810
00:56:21,619 --> 00:56:24,289
That's the last one, right? Take care.

811
00:56:26,190 --> 00:56:27,289
My gosh.

812
00:56:27,389 --> 00:56:29,860
Why are you helping out?

813
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:32,690
- You're not with the moving company.
- Of course, I should help.

814
00:56:33,289 --> 00:56:35,659
It's a pity to see you go.

815
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:38,630
I know. We're the last family...

816
00:56:38,699 --> 00:56:40,099
to leave this street.

817
00:56:40,769 --> 00:56:43,610
Thanks anyway. You must be
busy enough with your duties.

818
00:56:43,769 --> 00:56:45,269
I'll help them finish up.

819
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:46,940
- Thanks a lot.
- Sure.

820
00:56:47,139 --> 00:56:48,380
How nice of him.

821
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:50,579
Officer Jung.

822
00:56:51,409 --> 00:56:52,480
Ma'am.

823
00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:54,019
Hello.

824
00:56:55,019 --> 00:56:57,920
- Here. Drink this.
- Thanks.

825
00:56:59,219 --> 00:57:00,420
How's your leg?

826
00:57:01,789 --> 00:57:03,590
It's not as swollen.

827
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:05,989
- Do you use a hot pack often?
- Yes.

828
00:57:06,429 --> 00:57:09,030
I told you to replace
the band-aid every day.

829
00:57:09,099 --> 00:57:11,170
It heals quicker that way.

830
00:57:11,429 --> 00:57:12,429
Never mind.

831
00:57:12,530 --> 00:57:14,900
Is it a special day today?

832
00:57:14,969 --> 00:57:16,469
You're all dressed up.

833
00:57:16,699 --> 00:57:18,739
Oh? Well, yes.

834
00:57:19,210 --> 00:57:21,409
I went to Bong Yi's school.

835
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,980
You should dress like this every day.

836
00:57:26,050 --> 00:57:28,320
Your beauty is truly blinding.

837
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:32,389
This is the one flaw.

838
00:57:32,719 --> 00:57:34,920
I'll buy you a pretty one later on.

839
00:57:35,389 --> 00:57:37,960
Your eyeballs need fixing.

840
00:57:38,230 --> 00:57:41,000
I won't sell this for a million dollars.

841
00:57:42,429 --> 00:57:43,630
This was...

842
00:57:44,170 --> 00:57:46,599
a birthday present from Bong Yi.

843
00:57:47,170 --> 00:57:50,099
She made it when she was little.

844
00:57:51,469 --> 00:57:54,940
She must've been
really nice to you as a kid.

845
00:57:55,579 --> 00:57:58,250
"Granny" she'd call me.

846
00:57:58,309 --> 00:57:59,480
She'd jump into my arms,

847
00:57:59,650 --> 00:58:02,579
that's how sweet she was.

848
00:58:03,449 --> 00:58:04,519
Bong Yi?

849
00:58:05,719 --> 00:58:07,760
I can't imagine that.

850
00:58:12,590 --> 00:58:13,960
Officer Jung.

851
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:18,329
Can I ask you for...

852
00:58:18,730 --> 00:58:21,070
a favor?

853
00:58:32,409 --> 00:58:33,650
If you don't settle,

854
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:36,650
your granddaughter will go to prison
before she graduates.

855
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:39,750
(Land of Helpers, Workers needed)

856
00:58:42,690 --> 00:58:45,730
Even young people
can't find work these days.

857
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:48,960
Who would hire someone your age?

858
00:58:49,099 --> 00:58:50,369
They'd feel too uncomfortable.

859
00:58:50,429 --> 00:58:52,570
What? I may look...

860
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:56,340
really old because of my saggy skin,

861
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:59,039
but I'm actually not that old.

862
00:58:59,909 --> 00:59:03,210
I saw when you came in
and you have a weak leg.

863
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:04,449
That's because...

864
00:59:04,510 --> 00:59:07,280
I fell just now on the way up the stairs.

865
00:59:07,550 --> 00:59:10,719
I'll be just fine in no time.

866
00:59:10,889 --> 00:59:14,159
I'll take just half of
what other people are paid.

867
00:59:14,289 --> 00:59:17,190
Could you please find me a job?

868
00:59:17,630 --> 00:59:18,960
Drink this and then leave.

869
00:59:19,030 --> 00:59:20,659
Where are you going?

870
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:23,500
To the toilet. Leave when you're done.

871
00:59:32,309 --> 00:59:33,809
That's it.

872
00:59:34,809 --> 00:59:36,079
Fine, then.

873
00:59:47,590 --> 00:59:51,489
This works wonders
when Bong Yi's constipated.

874
00:59:52,590 --> 00:59:54,400
I'll borrow a few.

875
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:57,800
My goodness.

876
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:08,380
Hello? The boss lady went to poop...

877
01:00:10,610 --> 01:00:11,949
Is that so?

878
01:00:12,050 --> 01:00:14,449
I'll send someone right over.

879
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:18,489
What is the address?

880
01:00:18,590 --> 01:00:21,690
Yes. I'm listening.

881
01:00:22,289 --> 01:00:24,360
What? Okay.

882
01:00:25,090 --> 01:00:26,559
Yes.

883
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:38,210
Stop. Stop, stop.

884
01:00:38,269 --> 01:00:40,309
Stop, stop. That's it.

885
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:43,440
Let's call it a day.
You've really improved.

886
01:00:43,809 --> 01:00:45,050
Thank you.

887
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:50,420
It wasn't Eo Beong Yi, was it?

888
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:54,119
Did you come here to complain about that?

889
01:00:57,659 --> 01:01:00,090
Your grandma's worried you won't pick up.

890
01:01:00,530 --> 01:01:02,130
I said I'd look for you.

891
01:01:03,630 --> 01:01:06,670
Will you go home so she'll stop worrying?

892
01:01:08,239 --> 01:01:09,539
What a joke.

893
01:01:14,980 --> 01:01:16,610
You're a cop, so you can fight, right?

894
01:01:18,449 --> 01:01:20,280
That's perfect. Come up here.

895
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:22,320
What?

896
01:01:25,489 --> 01:01:28,260
Hey. Bong Yi. Bong Yi, Bong Yi.

897
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:32,690
Hey, Bong Yi.

898
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,070
Stop.

899
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:40,639
Bong Yi.

900
01:01:44,010 --> 01:01:45,039
Bong Yi.

901
01:01:47,809 --> 01:01:50,610
I give in. I surrender.

902
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:58,949
I feel sorry for
the residents on your beat.

903
01:01:59,449 --> 01:02:02,489
A weakling like you're
in charge of their safety.

904
01:02:03,090 --> 01:02:05,590
How did you become a cop
with stamina like that?

905
01:02:06,530 --> 01:02:09,030
Bong Yi. Do you know why...

906
01:02:09,429 --> 01:02:11,170
your grandma was late meeting you?

907
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:14,070
Why should I care?

908
01:02:14,969 --> 01:02:16,199
I don't want to know.

909
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:17,869
She was rushing,

910
01:02:19,409 --> 01:02:23,179
and she slipped in the rain
and sprained her ankle.

911
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:26,050
It was all swollen up.

912
01:02:28,150 --> 01:02:30,150
She's old already.

913
01:02:31,019 --> 01:02:33,860
You'll regret giving her a hard time
once she dies.

914
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:38,489
Be good to her while she's around
instead of regretting later on.

915
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:41,659
Officer Jung.

916
01:02:43,659 --> 01:02:45,329
Fend for your own self.

917
01:02:49,139 --> 01:02:50,239
Bong Yi.

918
01:02:56,679 --> 01:02:58,110
Do you really want to...

919
01:02:59,550 --> 01:03:00,750
marry me?

920
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:08,659
What a joke. Seriously.

921
01:03:14,099 --> 01:03:15,699
- Who are you?
- Who else?

922
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:17,300
I'm here to clean.

923
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:20,369
The usual cleaner said she's sick,

924
01:03:20,429 --> 01:03:22,400
so I'm here instead.

925
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:24,110
Lady.

926
01:03:27,409 --> 01:03:28,780
You have a guest.

927
01:03:29,739 --> 01:03:32,309
You don't have to mind me.

928
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:35,849
You can get back to your business.

929
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:38,650
I think Mom sent her.
She does that sometimes.

930
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:40,860
I should go.

931
01:03:41,690 --> 01:03:42,860
Okay, then.

932
01:03:44,730 --> 01:03:48,199
My gosh. What a spacious home this is.

933
01:03:49,230 --> 01:03:51,369
Do you pay monthly rent?

934
01:03:51,929 --> 01:03:54,239
You don't own it, do you?

935
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:58,710
I think Mom sent you.
I don't like it when someone else cleans.

936
01:03:59,170 --> 01:04:00,579
I'm sorry, but please leave.

937
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:02,710
I'll wipe every surface...

938
01:04:02,780 --> 01:04:05,480
so that it sparkles and shines.

939
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:07,820
It'll be so shiny you'll slip up.

940
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:09,679
Look forward to seeing what I do.

941
01:04:09,849 --> 01:04:11,590
You can do your thing.

942
01:04:11,690 --> 01:04:13,849
Don't you get in my way.

943
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:16,559
I'll go and get changed.

944
01:04:17,929 --> 01:04:20,059
Inspector Bok. Inspector Bok.

945
01:04:20,429 --> 01:04:22,630
Why must I submit all the evidence?

946
01:04:22,730 --> 01:04:23,760
How am I to investigate, then?

947
01:04:23,829 --> 01:04:26,500
I don't know. Submit it all first,
then check them out later.

948
01:04:26,570 --> 01:04:27,639
That doesn't make sense.

949
01:04:27,940 --> 01:04:29,599
Why are you taking it out on me?

950
01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:31,269
That jerk...

951
01:04:32,110 --> 01:04:33,809
What a troublemaker.

952
01:04:35,179 --> 01:04:36,980
Wake up and answer your phone!

953
01:04:37,610 --> 01:04:39,179
Inspector Bok...

954
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:40,579
(Senior Inspector's Office)

955
01:04:40,650 --> 01:04:41,820
Darn it.

956
01:04:47,420 --> 01:04:49,460
Troublemaker speaking.

957
01:04:49,519 --> 01:04:52,190
Mu Chi, I found out whom
Professor Lee spoke with on the phone.

958
01:04:52,630 --> 01:04:53,789
Really?

959
01:04:55,130 --> 01:04:56,699
Good work. Tell me the name.

960
01:04:58,199 --> 01:04:59,369
"Sung Yo Han"?

961
01:05:01,869 --> 01:05:02,900
"Sung Yo Han"?

962
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:05,210
The doctor who had performed
the surgery will know the details.

963
01:05:05,239 --> 01:05:06,739
Have you gotten in touch
with Dr. Sung Yo Han?

964
01:05:06,769 --> 01:05:08,480
Wasn't he the one who performed
the surgery on Na Chi Gook?

965
01:05:10,010 --> 01:05:11,150
Hello?

966
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:19,219
Why would the police be calling me?

967
01:05:22,789 --> 01:05:23,889
Okay.

968
01:05:32,769 --> 01:05:36,369
What? Goodness.

969
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:39,070
I must've dropped it while cleaning.
Let me have it.

970
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:42,639
Isn't it pretty?

971
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:45,150
My granddaughter...

972
01:05:45,809 --> 01:05:47,679
made it for me.

973
01:05:47,719 --> 01:05:49,579
This will be enough. You may leave now.

974
01:05:49,849 --> 01:05:52,550
What? Okay.

975
01:05:53,050 --> 01:05:56,389
Wait. Are you going to leave
dressed like that? No way.

976
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:58,829
It's very cold out.

977
01:05:58,860 --> 01:06:01,260
You should keep yourself warm. Here.

978
01:06:01,429 --> 01:06:03,130
Wear this.

979
01:06:03,199 --> 01:06:04,730
Here. Wear this.

980
01:06:04,929 --> 01:06:06,130
You should.

981
01:06:06,369 --> 01:06:08,699
Good. Goodbye.

982
01:06:12,409 --> 01:06:15,940
Goodness, he's so cold.

983
01:06:17,679 --> 01:06:18,750
What?

984
01:06:20,550 --> 01:06:21,650
Wait.

985
01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:25,019
There's so much. Goodness.

986
01:06:25,349 --> 01:06:27,619
This is a hefty sum.

987
01:06:27,690 --> 01:06:28,960
Goodness.

988
01:06:29,420 --> 01:06:31,929
He's rich and generous.

989
01:06:34,059 --> 01:06:35,460
If I work a bit more,

990
01:06:35,829 --> 01:06:38,929
I'll be able to make enough
to pay for the settlement fee.

991
01:06:44,639 --> 01:06:50,409
(Korea Martial Arts Association)

992
01:06:51,909 --> 01:06:53,050
Hello?

993
01:06:53,550 --> 01:06:55,280
Yes, that's me.

994
01:06:56,550 --> 01:06:57,690
Hello, sir.

995
01:06:58,090 --> 01:07:01,590
Mr. Na's amputated finger
wasn't stored, was it?

996
01:07:01,889 --> 01:07:03,860
The hospital probably still has it.

997
01:07:03,889 --> 01:07:06,559
I thought maybe it could have
the culprit's DNA,

998
01:07:06,789 --> 01:07:08,699
so I had asked them to keep it.

999
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:10,730
The Evidence Response Team says
that it's a piece of evidence...

1000
01:07:10,769 --> 01:07:12,769
and wants to take a look at it.

1001
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:14,099
I'll ask them right away.

1002
01:07:18,269 --> 01:07:19,340
Mr. Sung.

1003
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:28,280
Do you know Professor Daniel Lee?

1004
01:07:31,219 --> 01:07:33,219
I'm sure everyone does.

1005
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:35,289
But you don't know him personally?

1006
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:38,460
One minute. 010...

1007
01:07:45,329 --> 01:07:46,429
Pick that up.

1008
01:07:47,670 --> 01:07:49,940
Professor Lee had called this number.

1009
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:52,610
I did pick up a call
that was made by mistake.

1010
01:07:52,639 --> 01:07:55,739
Are you saying that
you spoke to a stranger...

1011
01:07:56,309 --> 01:07:58,610
for 3 minutes and 23 seconds?

1012
01:07:58,909 --> 01:08:00,250
I thought I hung up immediately.

1013
01:08:00,710 --> 01:08:01,920
But I guess I was wrong.

1014
01:08:02,750 --> 01:08:05,050
If we're done here, I'd like to leave.

1015
01:08:07,460 --> 01:08:09,019
What did you do on Monday?

1016
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:14,360
Oh, I was here regarding Mr. Na Chi Gook,

1017
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:15,960
but you weren't here.

1018
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,699
I called in sick.

1019
01:08:17,729 --> 01:08:19,029
I'm still on my sick leave.

1020
01:08:19,069 --> 01:08:21,439
- Then what about Sunday evening?
- I wasn't feeling well.

1021
01:08:21,470 --> 01:08:22,699
So what did you think I was doing?

1022
01:08:22,739 --> 01:08:23,899
I was resting.

1023
01:08:23,939 --> 01:08:25,340
Do you have an alibi?

1024
01:08:26,569 --> 01:08:27,880
What is this about?

1025
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:31,479
Professor Lee has gone missing.

1026
01:08:31,510 --> 01:08:33,550
And we believe it's a murder case.

1027
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:38,350
I was with a friend.

1028
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:41,659
Please write down
your friend's name and number.

1029
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:51,500
Please jot them down on the left side.

1030
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:15,720
If you have more questions,
file a subpoena.

1031
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:17,260
Mr. Sung.

1032
01:09:18,090 --> 01:09:19,229
Mr. Sung!

1033
01:09:21,199 --> 01:09:23,130
(Kim Joon Sung)

1034
01:09:26,569 --> 01:09:28,300
Thank you for keeping it safe.

1035
01:09:31,439 --> 01:09:34,279
What? This is strange.

1036
01:09:39,310 --> 01:09:40,449
Officer Jung.

1037
01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:44,350
- Detective Go.
- Where are you running off to?

1038
01:09:44,819 --> 01:09:47,789
This isn't Chi Gook's finger.

1039
01:09:48,859 --> 01:09:49,819
What?

1040
01:09:49,859 --> 01:09:52,130
A week before the incident,
we had gone fishing together.

1041
01:09:52,229 --> 01:09:54,430
And the fish hook got caught
in his finger.

1042
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:58,699
There should be a scar left on his finger,
but it's not there.

1043
01:09:59,729 --> 01:10:01,600
Are you saying
this is someone else's finger?

1044
01:10:08,340 --> 01:10:09,439
(Coffee)

1045
01:10:13,350 --> 01:10:15,319
So the killer left someone else's finger?

1046
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:16,880
Then what about Chi Gook's finger?

1047
01:10:18,449 --> 01:10:19,890
I'm not sure either.

1048
01:10:21,159 --> 01:10:22,760
There's a church
at the penitentiary, right?

1049
01:10:23,060 --> 01:10:24,460
- Yes.
- The cross.

1050
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:26,890
Detective Go!

1051
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:34,439
Tell me

1052
01:10:45,279 --> 01:10:47,579
What? What's that?

1053
01:10:51,949 --> 01:10:54,020
Yes. I should make sure...

1054
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:56,689
this entire house is squeaky clean.

1055
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:58,630
I need to win his favor...

1056
01:10:59,090 --> 01:11:01,659
if I want to work here for long.

1057
01:11:01,729 --> 01:11:02,800
Yes.

1058
01:11:02,899 --> 01:11:04,800
Gosh, it's steep.

1059
01:11:10,970 --> 01:11:12,039
Goodness.

1060
01:11:16,439 --> 01:11:18,680
Is it locked? What's this key?

1061
01:11:19,779 --> 01:11:21,449
How do I open this?

1062
01:11:40,529 --> 01:11:41,739
You're back.

1063
01:11:50,109 --> 01:11:51,109
What do you think?

1064
01:11:51,350 --> 01:11:54,079
Isn't your house squeaky clean?

1065
01:11:56,420 --> 01:11:58,390
Goodness. Oh, dear.

1066
01:11:58,789 --> 01:12:01,520
It's already so late.

1067
01:12:02,289 --> 01:12:04,289
I should get going.

1068
01:12:04,930 --> 01:12:06,090
Goodbye.

1069
01:12:09,329 --> 01:12:10,560
Oh, dear.

1070
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:18,810
You should take...

1071
01:13:19,170 --> 01:13:22,640
(Gudong 14)

1072
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:30,279
On the 13th, as Ms. A didn't
come back home from a walk,

1073
01:13:30,310 --> 01:13:32,310
her family reported her
missing to the police.

1074
01:13:32,350 --> 01:13:33,579
However, she was found dead...

1075
01:13:33,649 --> 01:13:35,149
Goodness.

1076
01:13:36,579 --> 01:13:38,520
Oh, dear.

1077
01:13:41,590 --> 01:13:42,720
Yes.

1078
01:13:43,390 --> 01:13:46,789
I should help my future grandson-in-law
with his performance record.

1079
01:13:48,199 --> 01:13:49,600
Goodness.

1080
01:13:55,369 --> 01:13:58,039
She slipped in the rain...

1081
01:13:58,069 --> 01:14:00,609
and sprained her ankle.
It was all swollen up.

1082
01:14:04,649 --> 01:14:05,810
Who is it for?

1083
01:14:05,850 --> 01:14:07,479
- Me.
- Is that so?

1084
01:14:07,579 --> 01:14:10,449
That one's nice. But how about this one?

1085
01:14:10,479 --> 01:14:12,920
- This one?
- That one.

1086
01:14:14,020 --> 01:14:15,159
How about this?

1087
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:17,760
She's old already.

1088
01:14:18,229 --> 01:14:20,989
You'll regret giving her a hard time
once she dies.

1089
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:23,529
- Be good to her while she's around.
- Goodbye.

1090
01:14:25,399 --> 01:14:26,800
How much is this?

1091
01:14:29,199 --> 01:14:30,340
I'll look over here.

1092
01:14:31,710 --> 01:14:33,869
Officer Jung, what's going on?

1093
01:14:33,909 --> 01:14:35,109
I'll tell you later.

1094
01:14:35,310 --> 01:14:36,310
But...

1095
01:14:45,390 --> 01:14:47,020
What are you looking for?

1096
01:14:50,619 --> 01:14:51,760
Father.

1097
01:14:52,359 --> 01:14:53,460
Hello, Father.

1098
01:14:53,630 --> 01:14:55,729
Officer Jung. Let's come back
after the service.

1099
01:14:55,829 --> 01:14:57,899
Detective. Let's come back
after the service.

1100
01:14:57,970 --> 01:14:59,470
We have no time to waste!

1101
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,130
Darn it.

1102
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:03,399
Who cares about mass
in these circumstances?

1103
01:15:03,470 --> 01:15:04,909
A person is dead!

1104
01:15:04,970 --> 01:15:06,539
They're trash! Will praying...

1105
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:08,510
make their crimes disappear?

1106
01:15:08,579 --> 01:15:10,579
- Will they go to heaven?
- You can't put it like that.

1107
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:12,310
How did I put it?

1108
01:15:12,409 --> 01:15:14,510
Will you please be quiet?

1109
01:15:14,579 --> 01:15:16,550
- This won't solve anything.
- Detective Go.

1110
01:15:16,619 --> 01:15:17,750
What?

1111
01:15:17,989 --> 01:15:19,149
What's this?

1112
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:31,729
Get a ladder.

1113
01:15:32,529 --> 01:15:33,930
Get a ladder, now.

1114
01:15:43,140 --> 01:15:45,909
All of you shall drink of this.

1115
01:15:46,310 --> 01:15:50,050
This is my blood which is
a new and everlasting covenant.

1116
01:15:50,850 --> 01:15:54,289
It is the blood that will be shed
to pardon the sins...

1117
01:15:54,350 --> 01:15:55,520
of you and many others.

1118
01:15:56,859 --> 01:15:58,729
- Remember me...
- Detective.

1119
01:15:58,859 --> 01:16:00,529
- and do as I bid.
- Detective Go.

1120
01:16:08,439 --> 01:16:10,770
What is it? Is there something up there?

1121
01:16:26,590 --> 01:16:31,020
(Na Chi Gook)

1122
01:16:37,859 --> 01:16:40,130
(Na Chi Gook)

1123
01:16:56,350 --> 01:16:59,390
(Gudong Village Entrance)

1124
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:07,890
(Fatty's General Store)

1125
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:10,600
(Closed)

1126
01:17:11,930 --> 01:17:14,069
Oh, dear. What should I do?

1127
01:17:17,039 --> 01:17:19,170
Hello? Fatty.

1128
01:17:19,739 --> 01:17:20,840
Fatty.

1129
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:22,779
Open up.

1130
01:17:23,710 --> 01:17:25,310
Oh, dear.

1131
01:17:45,399 --> 01:17:48,069
What? Did he follow me here?

1132
01:17:48,470 --> 01:17:50,739
What should I do?

1133
01:18:02,050 --> 01:18:03,279
Is something wrong?

1134
01:18:04,220 --> 01:18:05,319
Is it your friend?

1135
01:18:07,289 --> 01:18:09,590
We found Chi Gook's clothes
and the murder weapon.

1136
01:18:10,390 --> 01:18:12,159
Did you? Did they find anything?

1137
01:18:12,859 --> 01:18:15,529
I don't know yet.
They'll call with any results.

1138
01:18:21,670 --> 01:18:23,500
(Bong Yi's grandma, missed call)

1139
01:18:28,340 --> 01:18:31,579
The person you have reached
is not available. Please leave...

1140
01:18:38,789 --> 01:18:40,319
I need to go out.

1141
01:18:41,619 --> 01:18:43,920
(Fatty's General Store)

1142
01:18:49,529 --> 01:18:50,729
Ma'am!

1143
01:18:54,529 --> 01:18:55,699
Hello?

1144
01:18:57,470 --> 01:18:58,569
Ma'am!

1145
01:19:08,720 --> 01:19:09,779
Ma'am.

1146
01:19:26,699 --> 01:19:28,000
Ma'am. Are you here?

1147
01:19:31,170 --> 01:19:32,239
Ma'am.

1148
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:35,479
Ma'am.

1149
01:19:37,909 --> 01:19:39,250
Ma'am. Are you here?

1150
01:19:48,659 --> 01:19:51,689
Ma'am. What... Ma'am.

1151
01:19:55,359 --> 01:19:56,500
Who's there?

1152
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:50,380
- Oh, no!
- Who's that?

1153
01:20:50,579 --> 01:20:52,250
Oh, dear.

1154
01:20:52,319 --> 01:20:53,890
Someone got hit!

1155
01:20:54,250 --> 01:20:55,659
Call for help.

1156
01:20:55,819 --> 01:20:58,359
- Is he a policeman?
- Oh, dear.

1157
01:20:58,460 --> 01:21:00,130
Is he okay?

1158
01:21:00,189 --> 01:21:02,399
- Call someone.
- He needs help.

1159
01:21:03,229 --> 01:21:04,800
We need help.

1160
01:21:04,859 --> 01:21:06,369
- Call someone.
- What do we do?

1161
01:21:06,430 --> 01:21:08,539
Can you send an ambulance?

1162
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,470
Get here quick.

1163
01:21:12,770 --> 01:21:14,369
He got hit by a car.

1164
01:21:14,470 --> 01:21:16,310
Can someone do something?

1165
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:51,439
(Mouse)

1166
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:54,380
Are you sick? Why are you there?
Get in the car.

1167
01:21:54,449 --> 01:21:55,880
Did something happen in our village?

1168
01:21:56,050 --> 01:21:58,020
What a perverse psycho.

1169
01:21:58,149 --> 01:22:00,119
He kills people and takes photos?

1170
01:22:00,590 --> 01:22:02,090
Just say what I tell you to.

1171
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:05,729
I think you're right. Sung Yo Han's fishy.
What should we do?

1172
01:22:06,060 --> 01:22:09,659
Are you saying this serial killer's
also an exhibitionist psychopath?

1173
01:22:09,699 --> 01:22:10,560
(Patient Name: Jung Ba Reum)

1174
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:13,369
- The reason he chose them as victims.
- Go Mu Chi.

1175
01:22:13,569 --> 01:22:16,069
We must find out before the TV show airs.

1176
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:18,670
Who are you?
