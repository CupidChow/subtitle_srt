(The animal scenes are CGI.)

9
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:03,329
Mom. Why are you crying?

10
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,769
You monster. Die.

11
00:01:07,269 --> 00:01:08,409
Die!

12
00:01:10,579 --> 00:01:11,840
Just die.

13
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:27,689

Officer Jung.

16
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:52,019
Jung Ba Reum!

17
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,020
Doctor. What happened?

18
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,849
He died of a shock due to a heart attack.

19
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:30,020
No, that can't be.

20
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,659
- He was fine when we talked.
- My condolences.

21
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,599
He was fine.

22
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,370
Chi Gook, wake up, will you?

23
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:43,870
Chi Gook.

24
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:55,310
Hey. Chi Gook, wake up.

25
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:00,520
You said you wanted to live happily
with your mom, right?

26
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:03,189
You can't leave like this.

27
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:10,830
Chi Gook, wake up.

28
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:17,639
Please open your eyes, Chi Gook, please.

29
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:19,939
Chi Gook.

30
00:03:19,969 --> 00:03:21,169
Ba Reum.

31
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,530
What?

32
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:42,689
The shoes. Darn it.

33
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,460
What is it? Hey.

34
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,400
Ma'am!

35
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,069
Doctor!

36
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:17,430
I'll bring it back!

37
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,060
Hey! Stop!

38
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,199
Hey!

39
00:04:23,269 --> 00:04:24,800
What's his deal?

40
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:30,879
I did it. Yes, sir.

41
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:53,870
(Unmanned Hotel)

42
00:05:58,329 --> 00:05:59,300
(67D 6264)

43
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:10,480
(This is an unmanned hotel.)

44
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,980
(Minors not allowed)

45
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:24,860
Delivery.

46
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,730
Did you order food?

47
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:48,970
You killed Chi Gook, didn't you?

48
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:50,740
Why?

49
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,779
Why did you kill that poor kid?

50
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:56,050
That's rich coming from you,

51
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:57,750
you despicable scumbag.

52
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,850
That's right. I killed him, you monster.

53
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,550
I killed an innocent man because of you!

54
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:44,799
There has been an accident.

55
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:46,200
Please come quickly and clean up the mess.

56
00:08:51,139 --> 00:08:52,269
Stop!

57
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,289
Where did I see him?

58
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,700
What?

59
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,610
Did they remove the body?

60
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,240
In that short span of time?

61
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,110
This means
there are more than two of them.

62
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:51,129
Those men must've gotten rid
of Woo Hyeong Cheol and Han Guk as well.

63
00:09:59,539 --> 00:10:01,970
- Detective Go.
- Where are you?

64
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:03,309
Hello?

65
00:10:04,809 --> 00:10:06,509
I can't hear you.

66
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:07,509
Don't be ridiculous.

67
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,149
Where are you?

68
00:10:09,179 --> 00:10:11,320
Hello?

69
00:10:13,549 --> 00:10:14,690
Why can't I hear him?

70
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,110
What?

71
00:10:35,909 --> 00:10:37,440
What? This is...

72
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:40,850
This is where that OZ thief led me.

73
00:10:41,049 --> 00:10:42,179
Detective Go.

74
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,019
- Chi Gook...
- Hey, what's your deal?

75
00:10:46,049 --> 00:10:47,350
Why do you act so suspiciously?

76
00:10:47,389 --> 00:10:50,389
- What have you done to Chi Gook?
- He was murdered.

77
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,320
The guy confessed.

78
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:54,159
The guy?

79
00:10:54,429 --> 00:10:56,330
It's him. Him.

80
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,929
I can't see his face.

81
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:02,299
What about the parking lot CCTV?

82
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,139
We don't have any.

83
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:06,840
Most of our customers
don't want to be identified.

84
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:10,309
There's no way to identify him then.

85
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:13,610
How do they book a room
at an unmanned hotel?

86
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:15,809
They usually book online.

87
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:19,179
We also have a kiosk,
so they can book on the spot.

88
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,950
I'd like to see the payment history
for Room 802.

89
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:21,850
One minute.

90
00:11:22,889 --> 00:11:24,990
Room 802 is vacant.

91
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:28,090
- Sorry?
- It's been vacant for some time.

92
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:32,399
I'm sure that was the room.

93
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,299
I'm certain it was Room 802.

94
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:36,529
Let's check.

95
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,179
There was a laptop, two trays,
and a suitcase.

96
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:50,409
They were all here.

97
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,250
The moment he opened the door,

98
00:11:53,549 --> 00:11:55,350
I threw jjamppong broth at him.

99
00:11:55,389 --> 00:11:57,389
They even got rid of the stain...

100
00:11:57,659 --> 00:11:59,289
on this wall.

101
00:11:59,789 --> 00:12:02,159
How could they have done all that
in that short span of time?

102
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:03,929
The broth left a stain?

103
00:12:04,299 --> 00:12:05,460
I see nothing.

104
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,330
I'm telling you the truth.

105
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:14,169
Then look into his vehicle. 67D 6264.

106
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:16,870
That was his car.

107
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:19,409
Hold on. What did you just say?

108
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,279
- 67D 6264?
- Yes.

109
00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:26,919
67D 6264.

110
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,480
It really is jjamppong.

111
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:56,809
Right?

112
00:12:57,049 --> 00:12:58,549
You believe me now, right?

113
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,289
67D 6264.

114
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,389
It belongs to the petty thief who hit me
in the head and stole my wallet.

115
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:07,929
- What?
- It's that jerk's plate number.

116
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:11,299
I came to this motel
while searching for him.

117
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,429
It's him.

118
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,200
He killed Chi Gook.

119
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:21,610
Why? Why would a mugger kill Chi Gook?

120
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:37,090
That's rich coming from you,
you despicable scumbag.

121
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,320
That's right. I killed him, you monster.

122
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,860
I killed an innocent man because of you!

123
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:44,629
He knew who I really am.

124
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:46,860
He killed Chi Gook...

125
00:13:46,929 --> 00:13:48,929
- Then let's wrap up for now.
- because Chi Gook also knew who I am.

126
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,200
It's clean.

127
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,240
If you keep this up, you might
end up like "The Boy Who Cried Wolf".

128
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:58,840
Someone has been covering up
my murders actively.

129
00:13:59,179 --> 00:14:01,580
Who could that be? And why?

130
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:03,779
Did you take him to a hospital?

131
00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:07,590
This is the second time. He may have
a severe side effect of the brain surgery.

132
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,950
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

133
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,789
I just heard about the blood analysis.

134
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:16,230
No toxic chemicals were detected
in Chi Gook's blood.

135
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:23,000
But some toxic chemicals can't be detected
in blood tests.

136
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,340
Let's have an autopsy done
so that we can find out...

137
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,440
An autopsy can be performed when we can
prove that he was murdered.

138
00:14:28,509 --> 00:14:30,539
Or when his family makes a request for it.

139
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,539
I will... I will call his family.

140
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:37,049
A murder?

141
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:40,919
Yes. That's why Ba Reum said
that an autopsy is needed.

142
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:45,220
As you know, Officer Jung Ba Reum...

143
00:14:45,289 --> 00:14:47,990
has been showing symptoms
of delusional disorder after the surgery.

144
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:51,360
He once claimed
that he had killed someone,

145
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,129
but it was proved not to be true.

146
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:57,500
Your son was very unstable,
so we kept a close eye on him.

147
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:01,639
To a patient who wakes up
from unconsciousness like your son,

148
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:03,970
a heart attack happens often.

149
00:15:05,379 --> 00:15:07,909
If you still want to have it done,

150
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,480
we won't stop you.

151
00:15:10,179 --> 00:15:12,620
But as you must know, an autopsy...

152
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:14,919
wreak havoc on the body.

153
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:16,990
So if I were you...

154
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,259
If he were my son,

155
00:15:20,059 --> 00:15:22,190
I would let him go
without making him go through it.

156
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,220
Ma'am, you just have to sign here.

157
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:49,820
Let's stop this, Ba Reum.

158
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,190
It's not like
it can bring Chi Gook back to life.

159
00:15:54,259 --> 00:15:55,429
I know that, but ma'am,

160
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:57,659
Chi Gook didn't die of a heart attack.

161
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,330
We have to have an autopsy done
to find out who killed him...

162
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,669
I said, drop it!

163
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:05,139
Who would have killed Chi Gook?

164
00:16:05,769 --> 00:16:07,809
That murderer Sung Yo Han already died.

165
00:16:08,169 --> 00:16:09,240
Then who would have?

166
00:16:12,809 --> 00:16:13,879
I...

167
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:19,950
I don't want any more scars
on my son's body.

168
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,620
No more.

169
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:27,220
Let's...

170
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,889
let him go now.

171
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,059
Let's let him leave in peace.

172
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,799
But still...

173
00:17:00,259 --> 00:17:05,500
(Sung Yo Han isn't the real murderer
of the Mujin Serial Murders.)

174
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:10,500
(It's me, Jung Ba Reum.)

175
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:12,140
Now is not the right time.

176
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:13,740
I can't die just yet.

177
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,769
I'll catch those scums who killed Chi Gook
and kill them.

178
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:18,480
And then I'll kill myself.

179
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,750
Jung Ba Reum.

180
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,420
Don't be too disappointed.

181
00:17:31,819 --> 00:17:33,420
Let's find another way.

182
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:40,559
By the way,

183
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:43,170
why did you go to see Chi Gook?

184
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:45,740
It wasn't visiting hours yet.

185
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,809
Chi Gook asked me to visit him.

186
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:54,950
He did?

187
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,450
Why? What did he say?

188
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:04,220
He said he wanted to live happily
with his mother.

189
00:18:05,059 --> 00:18:06,089
What?

190
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,029
And...

191
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,730
It seemed like
someone was threatening him...

192
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,470
using his mother.

193
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:19,400
He was threatened?

194
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,480
Oh, right. That explains why he lied.

195
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,049
He lied?

196
00:18:28,109 --> 00:18:30,210
- Yes.
- But I don't remember the guy's face.

197
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:32,779
- I was attacked from behind, so...
- He said he was attacked from behind,

198
00:18:32,849 --> 00:18:34,920
so he couldn't see the face
of the man who stabbed him.

199
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:38,420
But the wounds on his body show
that he was attacked from the front.

200
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:41,230
I couldn't understand why he said
he didn't see the culprit's face.

201
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:43,859
It's understandable if he was threatened.

202
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,430
But there's still something
that doesn't make sense.

203
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,230
Only that someone
attacked me in the shower.

204
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,839
He was attacked in the shower facility
outside the building.

205
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:56,210
- In the shower facility?
- Yes.

206
00:18:56,609 --> 00:18:58,410
I found Chi Gook's blood there too.

207
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:02,480
However, he was found in the magic box
that was in the auditorium.

208
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:05,579
How did the culprit move his body
to the auditorium?

209
00:19:08,819 --> 00:19:11,559
I think I should go over his case
from the beginning.

210
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:33,980
(May the deceased rest in peace.)

211
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:45,420
I want...

212
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:47,930
I want to live happily with my mom.

213
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:52,660
So please...

214
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:55,900
turn yourself in.

215
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:58,700
But I can't be selfish
and turn a blind eye to this.

216
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:00,569
So you should do it.

217
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:02,470
That way, we can all live.

218
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:06,680
I'm sorry for not keeping my promise,
Chi Gook.

219
00:20:08,309 --> 00:20:09,910
I'm not turning myself in now.

220
00:20:12,019 --> 00:20:14,250
I'll kill that scum who killed you
with my own hands.

221
00:20:15,619 --> 00:20:16,990
Then I'll turn myself in.

222
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:23,789
By the way, I heard that I'll die soon.

223
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,559
I'll meet you there soon.

224
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:31,130
When you... When you see me there...

225
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:36,910
Dong Goo.

226
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:38,609
You're here.

227
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:01,099
Hello.

228
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,369
When I heard that Chi Gook woke up,

229
00:21:06,069 --> 00:21:08,509
I was so happy
as if Mi Jeong came back to life.

230
00:21:08,569 --> 00:21:10,470
Mi Jeong? Cho Mi Jeong?

231
00:21:10,539 --> 00:21:12,039
You came to the hospital to see him often.

232
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,079
- You also comforted...
- Song Soo Ho's mother?

233
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:17,150
My late brother Jong Ho will
warmly welcome him.

234
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:18,450
Park Jong Ho's sister?

235
00:21:18,579 --> 00:21:20,920
He won't be lonely, so don't worry.

236
00:21:21,849 --> 00:21:23,789
They're the families
of the people I killed.

237
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:32,859
Thank you.

238
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,700
Come with me.

239
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:42,210
Sit here.

240
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,420
You haven't eaten anything.
Eat this at least.

241
00:22:01,589 --> 00:22:03,529
Are you okay?
You must've burned yourself.

242
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:07,799
Hey.

243
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,869
Why won't you stop bothering me? Why?

244
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:13,200
I'm just...

245
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:16,740
- I'm just worried about you.
- Why would you worry about me?

246
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,210
- Why did you come here?
- You're here.

247
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:20,210
- Since when were you so close to him?
- Hey.

248
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:23,849
Why are you yelling at Bong Yi?
You should be thanking her.

249
00:22:24,049 --> 00:22:25,849
Hey... Ba Reum.

250
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:31,119
Move aside, Bong Yi.

251
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,519
I'll clean up.

252
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:35,029
You're all here.

253
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:38,500
Go home. Ba Reum just doesn't want you
to do hard work. He didn't mean it.

254
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:40,329
Go home now, okay?

255
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,609
Hey, Oh Bong Yi.

256
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:55,710
- Come and eat.
- Sure.

257
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:56,809
Okay.

258
00:23:41,059 --> 00:23:42,289
Die.

259
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,130
Die.

260
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:50,769
How did you become a cop
with stamina like that?

261
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,400
I give in. I surrender.

262
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,269
Her grandma is old
and won't live much longer.

263
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:58,339
That'll make her an orphan.

264
00:23:58,809 --> 00:24:00,839
She doesn't seem to have many friends.

265
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,279
Even if she notices what I am,
I can get rid of her easily.

266
00:24:05,549 --> 00:24:08,390
Yes. She's just perfect.

267
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:10,450
As the mother of my child.

268
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,259
Don't get sick.

269
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,190
I need you to be well...

270
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:18,029
for my child to be born healthy.

271
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,799
What should I do, Bong Yi?

272
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:24,230
What should I do?

273
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:40,519
Did you get the call?

274
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,920
Yes. I refused point blank.

275
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:45,720
She came to my house,

276
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:47,720
so I threw a bowl of salt at her.

277
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:48,960
I couldn't believe it.

278
00:24:51,329 --> 00:24:52,559
What call?

279
00:24:52,829 --> 00:24:55,029
I guess she didn't call you.

281

Yes. "A year after
the Mujin serial murders".

She's filming a documentary.

284
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,509
She wants to re-investigate
the case or something.

285
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:09,279
Why would she want to do that?

286
00:25:09,309 --> 00:25:12,079
Why do you think
she suddenly wants to do that?

287
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:15,450
She'll do anything to clear
her child's father's name.

288
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:20,390
Is the rumor true?

289
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,390
That Sung Yo Han had a child?

290
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,450
I guess she didn't call you.

- Why does it have only one leg?

- I just said it's not a dong.

- Your reach is so short.

It's the car that hit me that night?

330
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:35,670
We lost it here.

331
00:30:36,769 --> 00:30:38,140
We don't see it after this.

332
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:42,309
Shoot. Where did you go?

333
00:30:43,109 --> 00:30:47,119
The person who killed Chi Gook
hit me with a car a year ago?

334
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,150
Is this a coincidence?

335
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:50,250
I found it.

336
00:30:51,789 --> 00:30:52,960
Here.

337
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:54,420
- This number?
- Yes.

338
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:56,160
(Outside Gudong Station, Jung Ba Reum)

339
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,960
The number you called does not exist.

340
00:31:01,529 --> 00:31:03,170
Why do all the numbers not exist?

341
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,569
Can you run this person's identity?

342
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:07,069
Give me a moment.

343
00:31:12,009 --> 00:31:13,839
Why does someone else's license show up?

344
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,579
What's the matter?

345
00:31:16,609 --> 00:31:17,710
This can't be.

346
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:21,150
They must've run their ID
and checked then. What happened?

347
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:25,019
- What...
- Oh, they settled with your aunt.

348
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,759
If it's urgent, you could ask her.

349
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:30,289
Or call the insurance company.

350
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:32,529
There's no such incident.

351
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:37,970
The accident was registered in that name.

352
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,740
The offender settled with my aunt.

353
00:31:39,769 --> 00:31:40,799
Look at this.

354
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:43,140
Can you tell me the plate number again?

355
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:44,970
67D 6264.

356
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:47,940
It's probably categorized
as a pedestrian accident. I was injured.

357
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:51,109
No accidents have been registered
with that plate number.

358
00:31:52,019 --> 00:31:54,650
No way. At the police station...

359
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:57,750
What on earth happened?

360
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,029
- What are you looking at?
- How brazen.

361
00:32:04,259 --> 00:32:06,029
- Pardon?
- I'm talking about that wench,

362
00:32:06,099 --> 00:32:07,500
Choi Hong Ju.

363
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:09,500
You said you thought she was cool.

364
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,500
"Cool", my foot.

365
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:12,970
Why him out of all men?

366
00:32:13,269 --> 00:32:14,869
She posted that she's looking for
a babysitter...

367
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:17,410
on the online community
for moms living in my old neighborhood.

368
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,980
That poor boy Han Guk was found
without lungs.

369
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,650
How could she be so as brazen
to upload a post...

370
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:25,180
looking for a babysitter for her baby?

371
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:27,079
There's a lot of negative comments
on her post,

372
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:29,549
so I'm going to swear at her harshly too.

373
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:30,789
But I can't think of any swear words.

374
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:33,859
Eun Chong, here we go. Here we go.

375
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:37,059
- How cute. Yes?
- Hey, shake that toy for him.

376
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,759
- Okay.
- Eun Chong.

377
00:32:39,859 --> 00:32:42,369
Eun Chong.

378
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:45,339
(His previous babysitter is my relative.
She said he was unusually prickly.)

379
00:32:47,539 --> 00:32:50,809
(Babysitting her baby is the same as
raising a future murderer.)

380
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:56,779
- Hello?
- Is this Choi Hong Ju's phone?

381
00:32:57,009 --> 00:32:58,049
Yes, this is she.

382
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:03,950
(I just called that number.
It's Choi Hong Ju.)

383
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:06,460
(My gosh. She's so brazen.
How can she call herself human...)

384
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,559
What? Why?

385
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:10,630
It's not even worth writing a comment
like this.

386
00:33:11,029 --> 00:33:13,000
Don't give her any attention.

387
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:16,029
Don't read such comments.
It's not good for your mental health.

388
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:18,099
Just ring up for me.

389
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:21,339
(It's shocking. I'm speechless.)

390
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,910
(Such scums' information
must be disclosed,)

391
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:28,440
(and must be kept away from children.)

392
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:32,950
(I'd like to have an interview.
Here's my phone number.)

393
00:33:33,019 --> 00:33:35,890
(I'd like to have an interview.
Here's my phone number.)

394
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:47,130
Hello. I got the message you sent to me.

395
00:33:47,829 --> 00:33:50,529
I think I've seen you somewhere.
You look familiar.

396
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:54,000
I have a common face.

397
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,970
I get that a lot.

398
00:33:56,269 --> 00:33:58,109
I don't think you have a common face.

399
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:04,349
Have you ever babysat
someone else's child before?

400
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:07,680
I have never babysat
someone else's child.

401
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:11,590
But since I raised my son,

402
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:13,820
I'm sure I can do a good job.

403
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:15,190
I see.

404
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:18,190
Excuse me for a second.

405
00:34:22,929 --> 00:34:25,469
Are you hungry? Here.

406
00:34:26,269 --> 00:34:27,269
There you go.

407
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,639
Then do you live with your son now?

408
00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:31,969
No.

409
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,280
He died in an accident.

410
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:38,610
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked that.

411
00:34:40,349 --> 00:34:41,820
- What is it?
- Do you...

412
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,389
Do you have a plastic bag?

413
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:44,889
Let me check.

414
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:48,219
Here you go.

415
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:57,599
I did this whenever my son cried.

416
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:59,670
Magically, he stopped crying right away.

417
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:04,269
Also, he's not crying because he's hungry.

418
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:06,340
He's crying because he wants to have
his diaper changed.

419
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,780
- Okay.
- Come here.

420
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:11,380
I know, I know.

421
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:24,090
Can you start working tomorrow?

422
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:26,159
Of course.

423
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:32,369
Actually, the previous babysitter
did something...

424
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,500
Excuse me. Let me get this call.

425
00:35:36,539 --> 00:35:37,610
Yes, Writer Kang.

426
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:39,639
Really?

427
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:43,250
Okay. I'll call you back.

428
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:48,519
By any chance,
can you start working today?

429
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:50,190
Yes, of course.

430
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:53,420
I'll take good care of your baby.
Don't worry and go back to work.

431
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:55,960
Thank you.

432
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:07,199
You have his eyes.

433
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:09,369
And his nose.

434
00:36:27,989 --> 00:36:30,489
This is Soo Ho's mother.

435
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:33,360
I know. Have you been well?

436
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:37,300
I saw you stopping by my house yesterday.

437
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:41,369
Well... I went to see you...

438
00:36:41,469 --> 00:36:44,639
I heard
from the other victims' families...

439
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:46,940
that you're preparing a show.

440
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:50,010
I see.

441
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:51,849
I'll do it.

442
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,420
Pardon me?

443
00:36:53,579 --> 00:36:55,050
I'll do an interview.

444
00:36:56,019 --> 00:36:59,360
I have something I must say on TV.

445
00:37:00,489 --> 00:37:02,659
Okay. When will it be convenient for you?

446
00:37:02,789 --> 00:37:03,929
Shall I go to your house?

447
00:37:04,489 --> 00:37:05,829
Not at my house...

448
00:37:06,329 --> 00:37:08,730
I'll go to the TV station tomorrow.

449
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:11,300
Will you? All right.

450
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:12,739
I'll see you then.

451
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:17,440
What does she want to say?

452
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,409
He came in and went out alone.

453
00:37:24,579 --> 00:37:27,849
He daringly walked into this building
and receive something here.

454
00:37:29,349 --> 00:37:30,650
Who is that guy?

455
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,559
I think he handed a piece of paper to him.

456
00:37:35,989 --> 00:37:37,530
I'm pretty sure he's an insider.

457
00:37:39,699 --> 00:37:40,860
It's from Porn Boy.

458
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,599
He sent me another video clip.

459
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:45,599
(Deleted Part of the Video)

460
00:37:52,539 --> 00:37:53,880
That punk.

461
00:38:01,219 --> 00:38:02,320
Wait.

462
00:38:03,349 --> 00:38:05,960
Isn't that
Kang Deok Soo's mother's statement?

463
00:38:13,099 --> 00:38:14,699
- Hey, Golden Boy.
- Oh, my.

464
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,269
Mu Chi, I was going to go
to see you first.

465
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,840
Thank you for hosting my wedding ceremony.
I bought a small stone statue for you.

466
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,409
It's really cute.
I'll bring it to you later.

467
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:25,369
Hey, when did you say
you gave Detective Lee...

468
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:26,510
Kang Deok Soo's mother's statement?

469
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:30,210
On the shooting day of "Sherlock Hong Ju",
right after she gave it to me.

470
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:32,920
- Is that so?
- But he forgot to deliver it.

471
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,179
Does that make sense?

472
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:36,349
I mean, he's so thoughtless. Gosh.

473
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:38,590
Had he delivered it to Inspector Bok
right away,

474
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:41,389
you would've been released sooner
and Bong Yi wouldn't have been hurt.

475
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:44,090
There's only one good thing that happened
because he made that mistake.

476
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,389
That Kang Deok Soo died.

477
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:50,230
I'm just saying, you know.

478
00:38:50,969 --> 00:38:52,500
(Senior Inspector's Office)

479
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:53,599
Inspector Bok.

480
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:57,710
What time did Detective Lee give you
Kang Deok Soo's mother's statement?

481
00:38:57,909 --> 00:38:59,809
I don't know the exact time.

482
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:02,210
When I heard that Ki Hyuk let you go...

483
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,610
and yelled at him, Detective Lee gave it
to me saying he forgot about it.

484
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:07,880
He gave it to you
after I was released, right?

485
00:39:07,949 --> 00:39:09,119
Correct.

486
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,889
What? He said he even forgot
that I had given him that.

487
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:21,730
There's no way he showed it
to anyone else. That must not be it.

488
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:23,800
And he's even an outsider.

489
00:39:23,869 --> 00:39:25,800
Listen. Detective Lee...

490
00:39:25,869 --> 00:39:29,269
showed it to OZ at 8pm,
and he kept it after that.

491
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:31,170
Ki Hyuk, you released me at 10pm.

492
00:39:31,269 --> 00:39:33,340
Then he gave it to Inspector Bok. Why?

493
00:39:33,409 --> 00:39:36,349
Since I was released, he had no reason
to hide the statement any longer.

494
00:39:36,409 --> 00:39:40,019
This punk OZ who read the statement
tried to hit my car with a truck...

495
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:41,619
when I was on my way to Bong Yi.

496
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:43,690
I got into the accident
while trying to avoid the truck.

497
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:47,489
He hit me in the back of my head
when I got out of my car.

498
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,760
He took my wallet
to make it look like a robbery.

499
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:54,360
Are you saying that he knew
you would go to Bong Yi,

500
00:39:54,429 --> 00:39:56,829
so he was waiting for you on the way?

501
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,369
- Exactly.
- Why?

502
00:39:58,469 --> 00:40:01,000
If I had arrived there sooner,
Kang Deok Soo wouldn't have died.

503
00:40:01,099 --> 00:40:03,369
OZ and the killer of Kang Deok Soo
worked together.

504
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,269
OZ bought the killer time
to kill Kang Deok Soo.

505
00:40:08,409 --> 00:40:09,650
Don't you think you've gone too far?

506
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,349
Are you saying that Kang Deok Soo's killer
is Detective... Detective Lee?

507
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:19,190
Right. You said
the killer might be an insider.

508
00:40:19,389 --> 00:40:21,789
So we came here
and checked the CCTV footage.

509
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:23,929
No. I checked the CCTV footage again
just to be sure,

510
00:40:23,989 --> 00:40:26,329
but he was in this building
at the time of Kang Deok Soo's death.

511
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,230
True. He was with me.

512
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:29,800
Who is it then?

513
00:40:29,869 --> 00:40:32,699
We can just interrogate Detective Lee.
We'll find out something.

514
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,039
We must be cautious.

515
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:36,170
He might get rid of all the evidence
if we make a wrong move.

516
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:38,510
Keep an eye on Detective Lee.

517
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:40,809
And keep looking for the unregistered car,
67D 6264.

518
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,750
- I'll do that.
- Let's not tell anyone for now.

519
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:45,280
- Let's keep it between us.
- Okay.

520
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,989
By the way, I think
that the killer of Kang Deok Soo...

521
00:40:50,889 --> 00:40:53,460
also has something to do with
Na Chi Gook's murder.

522
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:56,230
- What?
- Na Chi Gook was murdered?

523
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:58,329
Yes. I don't have any evidence though.

524
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,829
Officer Jung said he saw something.

525
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:03,429
I think that the same person
killed Na Chi Gook too.

526
00:41:03,969 --> 00:41:05,570
Why would he kill Na Chi Gook?

527
00:41:06,099 --> 00:41:07,369
I think he was threatened.

528
00:41:07,869 --> 00:41:08,940
What do you mean by that?

529
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:16,579
The place where Sung Yo Han killed
Na Chi Gook...

530
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:18,210
is strange.

531
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:19,949
Why is it strange?

532
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:24,420
I didn't make a mistake, did I?

533
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:27,489
What do you mean? What mistake?

534
00:41:28,289 --> 00:41:29,489
What if it wasn't Sung Yo Han?

535
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:34,300
What if it wasn't Sung Yo Han
who attempted to kill Na Chi Gook?

536
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:38,699
Don't you remember the live show?

537
00:41:38,769 --> 00:41:40,840
Sung Yo Han mentioned Na Chi Gook.

538
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,340
He mentioned "The Emperor's New Clothes"
and punished him for being humble.

539
00:41:44,809 --> 00:41:48,909
But what if the caller wasn't Sung Yo Han?

540
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:52,409
What if he didn't commit
those serial killings in Mujin?

541
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:54,449
Come on. That's not true.

542
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:57,949
He crushed Officer Jung's skull.

543
00:41:57,989 --> 00:42:01,320
We even found a photo
of Byun Soon Young's body in his house.

544
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:02,590
Of course, it's him.

545
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:05,960
This is solid evidence. Solid evidence.

546
00:42:06,329 --> 00:42:08,099
Right?

547
00:42:11,099 --> 00:42:12,170
But...

548
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:16,269
something smells fishy.

549
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:38,889
It became squeaky clean
in a blink of an eye.

550
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,199
They must be professionals.

551
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:14,360
Please make it quick.

552
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:21,239
I ran it in our ex-convict database,
and he popped up right away.

553
00:43:21,269 --> 00:43:22,500
It was him?

554
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:34,320
Please come back later.

555
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:40,820
It was him.

556
00:43:41,389 --> 00:43:43,159
Who are you? Are you his family?

557
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:47,760
I work at an architecture firm, you know?

558
00:43:49,699 --> 00:43:50,800
It's my uncle.

559
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:57,710
I've found no record of a Park Min Sung
or a Lee Pil Seung having flown abroad.

560
00:43:59,739 --> 00:44:03,909
Then how about Kim Hee Jin
and Park Hoon Seok?

561
00:44:03,949 --> 00:44:06,280
They're my aunt and cousin.

562
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:07,920
I've found nothing.

563
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:10,349
I see.

564
00:44:14,119 --> 00:44:16,260
- Excuse me.
- That house is vacant.

565
00:44:16,929 --> 00:44:18,230
They moved.

566
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:19,829
Didn't Hoon Seok use to live here?

567
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:21,699
I'm his cousin,

568
00:44:21,829 --> 00:44:23,170
and I can't reach him.

569
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:25,630
I guess you didn't know they moved.

570
00:44:26,099 --> 00:44:29,139
But then again, they left in a hurry.

571
00:44:29,639 --> 00:44:31,510
It was as if they were running away.

572
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:34,510
I thought something had happened to them.

573
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:35,809
They seemed to be running away?

574
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,179
When did they move?

575
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:44,289
Let's see.
One time, Hoon Seok had gone missing.

576
00:44:44,719 --> 00:44:47,289
She panicked
and looked everywhere for him.

577
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:50,059
The next morning,
she had brought her son back home.

578
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:53,199
That day, the movers came...

579
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:54,400
and moved their belongings.

580
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,630
That's the day he slept over at my house.

581
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,769
Who lived here?

582
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,710
Hoon Seok and his mom.

583
00:45:04,239 --> 00:45:05,369
What about his dad?

584
00:45:05,409 --> 00:45:07,380
He doesn't have one.

585
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:09,780
They divorced when he was an infant.

586
00:45:09,809 --> 00:45:11,349
I heard he lives in the US.

587
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:16,219
Right. We always lived
in the same neighborhood.

588
00:45:17,219 --> 00:45:20,260
And after my surgery,
I moved closer to her home.

589
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:24,690
What do you think? Your uncle and I
worked like dogs to purchase this house.

590
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:26,860
It's more than 50 years old,

591
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:29,130
and we renovated the house ourselves.

592
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,599
It was exhausting.

593
00:45:31,099 --> 00:45:33,570
Leave it to me to fix your house.

594
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:36,840
I work at an architecture firm, you know?

595
00:45:36,869 --> 00:45:38,570
So trust me with it.

596
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:39,780
Okay.

597
00:45:40,409 --> 00:45:43,079
- Yes. Hoon Seok wasn't there.
- Let's eat.

598
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:44,010
It was just them two.

599
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:45,449
You don't remember Hoon Seok, do you?

600
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:48,349
You looked after him very often
when he was a baby.

601
00:45:50,389 --> 00:45:52,119
Was it all a lie?

602
00:45:53,159 --> 00:45:55,690
Was everything around me fake?

603
00:45:57,190 --> 00:45:59,389
This is
Mr. Kim Man Ho's family certificate.

604
00:45:59,429 --> 00:46:03,329
(Child: Kim Hee Jung)

605
00:46:04,469 --> 00:46:06,199
My mom never had a sibling.

606
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:15,480
Are you Jae Hoon?

607
00:46:21,519 --> 00:46:23,690
You poor thing.

608
00:46:23,949 --> 00:46:25,190
My nephew.

609
00:46:25,989 --> 00:46:27,059
Who are you?

610
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:31,190
Jae Hoon, I'm your aunt.

611
00:46:31,659 --> 00:46:32,900
I'm your mom's younger sister.

612
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:35,300
I heard the news late...

613
00:46:36,099 --> 00:46:37,500
because I was living in the US.

614
00:46:38,699 --> 00:46:41,769
I can't stand the strange looks
people give me.

615
00:46:41,969 --> 00:46:44,670
I should act like everyone else.

616
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:47,610
- Aunt.
- I don't need the attention.

617
00:46:48,679 --> 00:46:50,210
It pains me.

618
00:46:53,079 --> 00:46:54,219
Don't you worry.

619
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:58,289
Let's live together from now on, okay?

620
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,030
Come in.

621
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:09,769
This is your new house.

622
00:47:13,269 --> 00:47:14,340
Hey.

623
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,670
It's nice to meet you, Jae Hoon.
I'm your uncle.

624
00:47:18,269 --> 00:47:19,510
Hello.

625
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:23,909
Jae Hoon. I'll move your name
to our family certificate.

626
00:47:24,849 --> 00:47:27,449
Then I'd like to change my name as well.

627
00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:28,679
To what?

628
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:31,820
Ba Reum. "Righteousness".

629
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:33,559
Jung Ba Reum.

630
00:47:35,289 --> 00:47:38,429
What's the hourly pay? Not bad.

631
00:47:42,699 --> 00:47:45,230
I left all my stuff back at the office.

632
00:47:47,539 --> 00:47:49,269
I can't ask them to mail it to me.

633
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:53,840
Fine. I didn't do anything wrong.

634
00:47:54,139 --> 00:47:55,380
I'll get it myself.

635
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,280
Hey, I'm afraid I'm running late.

636
00:47:58,179 --> 00:48:01,050
Song Soo Ho's mother will be waiting
in the lobby.

637
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:02,519
Please escort her upstairs.

638
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:03,949
Sure. Got it.

639
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:05,989
Darn it.

640
00:48:06,719 --> 00:48:09,260
Where's our assistant? This is so hectic.

641
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:13,630
Bong Yi, what's your deal?
Why haven't you been picking up?

642
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,599
I'm sorry.

643
00:48:15,829 --> 00:48:19,230
- Actually...
- I don't want to hear it right now.

644
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:20,940
Pick up our guest from the lobby.

645
00:48:21,469 --> 00:48:24,340
I'm sorry, but I'm only here
to pick up my belongings.

646
00:48:24,369 --> 00:48:25,639
Look for Song Soo Ho's mother.

647
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:27,739
She's a bereaved family member
of the Mujin Serial Murders,

648
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:30,079
so mind your manners and be polite.
Got that?

649
00:48:30,309 --> 00:48:31,679
Mujin Serial...

650
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:33,650
Why is she here?

651
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:36,519
She agreed to be interviewed
for a special on that case.

652
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:38,449
Why are we suddenly doing that?

653
00:48:38,489 --> 00:48:39,789
Beats me.

654
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:42,590
It's like Ms. Choi is begging to be hated.

655
00:48:42,659 --> 00:48:44,630
Anyway, do as I told you. Got it?

656
00:48:48,429 --> 00:48:51,800
What? Was I not enough?

657
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:54,139
She's reaching out
to other bereaved families too?

658
00:49:02,139 --> 00:49:04,179
His fingerprints could still be there.

659
00:49:04,949 --> 00:49:06,619
Where is that statement?

660
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:09,119
Kang Deok Soo...

661
00:49:10,219 --> 00:49:11,389
Darn it.

662
00:49:18,590 --> 00:49:20,730
That darn punk.
I told you to organize them properly,

663
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:21,960
Ba Reum.

664
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:54,230
Hello, ma'am. It's me.

665
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:55,829
I have something to ask you.

666
00:49:55,929 --> 00:49:57,000
Where are you?

667
00:49:57,369 --> 00:49:59,369
I'm outside right now.

668
00:49:59,469 --> 00:50:00,469
Where?

669
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:03,869
I'm at the OBN station to do an interview.

670
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:05,269
An interview?

671
00:50:05,809 --> 00:50:07,710
Okay, I'll go there right now.

672
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:08,980
What's this about?

673
00:50:13,579 --> 00:50:16,179
Are you here to meet with Choi Hong Ju?

674
00:50:16,389 --> 00:50:18,820
- Yes.
- Don't do the interview.

675
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,420
Don't let her use you.

676
00:50:32,170 --> 00:50:34,139
I'm the granddaughter
of the grandmother in Gudong.

677
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:35,869
The one who was murdered by Sung Yo Han.

678
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:40,780
Choi Hong Ju knew
that I was a bereaved family member.

679
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,980
and kept her mouth shut and approached me.

680
00:50:45,010 --> 00:50:46,980
I think there's a misunderstanding.

681
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:49,750
- Ms. Choi's not a bad person.
- No.

682
00:50:50,119 --> 00:50:52,119
You don't know the truth.

683
00:50:54,059 --> 00:50:55,760
After Soo Ho died,

684
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:58,760
I tried many times to kill myself.

685
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:02,630
One day, I jumped into the water,

686
00:51:03,099 --> 00:51:05,599
and Ms. Choi jumped in and saved me.

687
00:51:06,469 --> 00:51:10,110
She could've drowned herself.

688
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:14,579
When I was in the hospital,
she cared for me all night.

689
00:51:14,809 --> 00:51:17,409
I guess she had
the conscience to feel bad.

690
00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:20,679
Do you know who Choi Hong Ju is?

691
00:51:21,349 --> 00:51:23,019
She's Sung Yo Han's ex-girlfriend.

692
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:26,659
Right now, she's raising his child.

693
00:51:28,119 --> 00:51:29,659
I know that. I heard.

694
00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:34,500
At the time, I wondered
why she cared so much about me.

695
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:39,530
I decided to think it was because of
her relationship with Sung Yo Han.

696
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:44,340
Sung Yo Han's the bad person.
Ms. Choi didn't do anything wrong.

697
00:51:45,539 --> 00:51:47,639
I'm sure she suffered as well.

698
00:51:48,110 --> 00:51:50,579
- We should understand...
- No.

699
00:51:50,849 --> 00:51:52,449
Choi Hong Ju is weird.

700
00:51:52,909 --> 00:51:55,780
She'll use anyone if it suits her needs.

701
00:51:57,090 --> 00:51:58,820
So don't let her use you.

702
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:01,320
Don't do the interview.

703
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:03,760
I called her.

704
00:52:04,030 --> 00:52:06,500
I said I'd do the interview.

705
00:52:10,699 --> 00:52:11,730
Why?

706
00:52:12,699 --> 00:52:14,739
There's something I want to say.

707
00:52:15,769 --> 00:52:17,869
Something that has been bothering me.

708
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:22,679
What's that?

709
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:27,250
Sung Yo Han.

710
00:52:28,679 --> 00:52:30,519
I don't think he's the killer.

711
00:52:32,849 --> 00:52:33,920
What?

712
00:52:41,230 --> 00:52:42,760
What are they all doing here?

713
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:51,010
Why are you still here?

714
00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:52,769
- Well...
- Let's go upstairs.

715
00:52:58,849 --> 00:53:00,019
Choi Hong Ju!

716
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:04,920
We refused the interview,
so you got Soo Ho's mother involved?

717
00:53:05,019 --> 00:53:07,289
- No, I called...
- We told you to pull the show.

718
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:09,019
Can't you get the message?

719
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:11,230
Why are you torturing us?

720
00:53:11,289 --> 00:53:12,960
I'm not taking sides.

721
00:53:13,030 --> 00:53:15,130
- I'll report the facts...
- The facts?

722
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:17,530
A passing dog would laugh at that.

723
00:53:18,269 --> 00:53:20,139
You're using Soo Ho's naive mom...

724
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:22,269
to paint your lover in a different light.

725
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:24,769
You're filming the show to clear his name.

726
00:53:25,039 --> 00:53:28,579
Because you want to say
your child's father isn't a killer!

727
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:29,880
Watch what you say.

728
00:53:29,949 --> 00:53:31,280
You shameless witch.

729
00:53:31,409 --> 00:53:33,550
Could you not find
any other man to sleep with?

730
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:35,380
Don't say something you'll regret.

731
00:53:35,449 --> 00:53:37,750
- What did you just say?
- Don't do this.

732
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:39,960
- You brat!
- Let go of her.

733
00:53:40,019 --> 00:53:42,019
- Cancel the show!
- Don't hurt us again.

734
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:44,489
- What are you doing? Stop it.
- Give it up!

735
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:46,030
- Ma'am.
- Drop the show!

736
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:48,400
- Pay the price!
- Bring my family back!

737
00:53:48,530 --> 00:53:51,469
Sung Yo Han.
I don't think he's the killer.

738
00:53:51,969 --> 00:53:53,070
Darn it.

739
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:55,000
At first,

740
00:53:55,739 --> 00:53:58,670
when I heard that
Sung Yo Han had killed my son,

741
00:53:59,269 --> 00:54:01,880
I was in too much shock to think.

742
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:06,579
But as time went by, I thought...

743
00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:09,820
it wasn't Doctor Sung.

744
00:54:10,590 --> 00:54:13,119
I wanted to tell her about...

745
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:16,829
the Doctor Sung I know.

746
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:19,760
What's that?

747
00:54:20,730 --> 00:54:22,460
I'll explain in the interview.

748
00:54:25,329 --> 00:54:26,369
Hang on.

749
00:54:27,099 --> 00:54:28,239
So,

750
00:54:29,170 --> 00:54:32,710
you believe that
Sung Yo Han isn't the killer?

751
00:54:33,809 --> 00:54:36,010
I fought him myself. In person...

752
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:37,280
Did you see his face?

753
00:54:38,210 --> 00:54:40,179
Was it Sung Yo Han for sure?

754
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:46,619
At the time...

755
00:54:48,519 --> 00:54:49,789
I didn't see him then,

756
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:54,400
but I saw him clearly when he tried to
hit Ba Reum in the head.

757
00:54:55,030 --> 00:54:57,500
The police found
photos of the victims in his house.

758
00:54:58,929 --> 00:55:00,869
I didn't get that either.

759
00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:04,809
That's why I was going to keep quiet.

760
00:55:06,409 --> 00:55:10,610
But I want to tell her what I saw myself.

761
00:55:11,079 --> 00:55:12,750
What is wrong with her?

762
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:15,050
She's so annoying.

763
00:55:16,550 --> 00:55:18,250
Why are you investigating this again?

764
00:55:20,090 --> 00:55:21,260
I just don't get it.

765
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:25,190
Is it really to clear Sung Yo Han?

766
00:55:27,159 --> 00:55:28,860
Don't do that, for me, at least.

767
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:36,969
Let's go. I'll take you home.

768
00:55:37,110 --> 00:55:39,070
- What about the interview?
- Come with me.

769
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,849
Why did you call me?

770
00:55:51,590 --> 00:55:54,159
I wanted to see
some old photos of your son.

771
00:55:54,889 --> 00:55:56,489
What for?

772
00:55:57,159 --> 00:55:58,460
I want to check something.

773
00:56:05,929 --> 00:56:07,000
That kid?

774
00:56:07,269 --> 00:56:09,139
He was so peculiar.

775
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:12,940
He got a mouse from somewhere
and threw it to the snake.

776
00:56:14,039 --> 00:56:15,610
- There's a mouse.
- It caused pandemonium.

777
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:18,610
His mom begged and pleaded,

778
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:20,880
so we barely let him graduate.

779
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:23,989
From what I heard,
even in elementary school,

780
00:56:24,050 --> 00:56:25,719
he caused other problems.

781
00:56:27,719 --> 00:56:30,360
I heard he went to
Guryeong Elementary School.

782
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:54,780
You can draw whatever you want today.

783
00:56:57,949 --> 00:56:59,719
Class President,
why are you scratching yourself?

784
00:57:02,289 --> 00:57:04,159
Stop drawing and go to the nurse's...

785
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:23,750
Why did you kill the rabbit?

786
00:57:26,349 --> 00:57:28,280
I wanted to see...

787
00:57:28,849 --> 00:57:30,719
if it was fat or pregnant.

788
00:57:31,849 --> 00:57:32,920
What?

789
00:58:38,849 --> 00:58:40,019
Who is this?

790
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,019
Jung Jae Hoon?

791
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:51,730
Jung Jae Hoon.

792
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,670
Mom. Mom.

793
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:03,739
- Come on!
- You're it!

794
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,110
Mom.

795
01:01:47,039 --> 01:01:48,309
It was me.

796
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:54,820
I...

797
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:58,250
I murdered my entire family.

798
01:02:35,619 --> 01:02:36,760
Mom.

799
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:41,500
Why are you crying?

800
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:47,340
You monster. Die!

801
01:02:52,670 --> 01:02:55,909
Die!

802
01:03:15,329 --> 01:03:16,699
Song Soo Ho?

803
01:03:21,570 --> 01:03:25,110
(We will remember your beautiful face.
Rest in peace, Cheon Jung Ha.)

804
01:03:39,219 --> 01:03:41,619
(Mouse)

805
01:03:42,889 --> 01:03:44,860
How long has he been tailing me?

806
01:03:44,889 --> 01:03:46,590
Sung Yo Han attempted to kill Chi Gook.

807
01:03:46,630 --> 01:03:48,159
The OZ thief killed Chi Gook.

808
01:03:49,059 --> 01:03:51,929
Money? I do this with a sense of duty.

809
01:03:52,769 --> 01:03:53,900
Who are you?

810
01:03:54,039 --> 01:03:55,570
Are you all psychopaths?

811
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:56,969
