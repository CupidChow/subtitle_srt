Do you think you're special?

23
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:09,090
Did you take on that persona
to kill people?

24
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:14,430
You're nothing but
a psychopathic serial killer!

25
00:03:17,469 --> 00:03:18,840
Don't hide. Come out!

00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,569
Come out, you punk!

five years for assaulting a rapist...

to save his step-daughter
resulting in his death...

29
00:03:43,129 --> 00:03:45,460
was found murdered
shortly after his release.

30
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:49,500
The man was sentenced to five years
for foul play in 2016...

31
00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:52,969
Our newsroom just received a video
from an anonymous sender.

32
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,110
The scenes can be shocking for some.

33
00:03:56,469 --> 00:04:00,449
But an even more shocking truth
is about to be revealed.

34
00:04:00,509 --> 00:04:03,349
Spare me. I did it.

35
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:04,979
I killed them all.

36
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:08,819
The women who died in Suseong.
I killed them all.

37
00:04:10,189 --> 00:04:14,560
The schoolgirl who went missing from
Suseong Middle School.

38
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:18,060
There's a large rock
on the mountain behind the school.

39
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,199
I buried her there.

40
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:23,970
The belongings of the women
from Suseong that I killed.

41
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,069
They're all buried there!

42
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:30,939
I confessed to everything now.

43
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:34,610
Please spare me. Don't kill me!

44
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,420
Spare me! Let me live!

45
00:04:41,589 --> 00:04:42,649
Mister.

46
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,459
No!

47
00:04:48,829 --> 00:04:49,889
Don't die.

48
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,560
Your innocence has finally been proved.
Why would you want to die?

49
00:05:05,709 --> 00:05:06,810
Bong Yi.

50
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:12,879
What's wrong, Bong Yi?

51
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:15,350
Tell me.

52
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,430
Do you think you're special?

53
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,959
Did you take on that persona
to kill people?

54
00:05:28,069 --> 00:05:31,170
You're nothing but
a psychopathic serial killer!

55
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:36,970
I'm a murderer.

56
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:39,810
I killed a man.

57
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,009
I'm...

58
00:05:45,149 --> 00:05:46,879
not the person you know.

59
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:56,459
Ba Reum.

60
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,899
They're the same shape as
the slices found on the Suseong victims.

61
00:06:36,069 --> 00:06:37,240
The number's right too.

62
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:42,040
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

63
00:06:43,339 --> 00:06:44,509
What happened?

64
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:51,649
I realized that I'd forgotten
to ask a question during the interview.

65
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,550
I heard of his release today,
so I went to see him.

66
00:06:54,949 --> 00:06:58,490
(Bus Stop, Mujin Prison)

67
00:07:09,269 --> 00:07:10,899
Ms. Choi, what brings you here?

68
00:07:11,069 --> 00:07:14,209
I came to interview another inmate
and saw you leave.

69
00:07:15,009 --> 00:07:17,110
- Did you just get released?
- Yes.

70
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:18,480
Where are you headed?

71
00:07:18,509 --> 00:07:20,550
I suggested I interview him nearby.

72
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:23,850
I'm going to Suseong.
I want to visit my mom's grave.

73
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,779
He asked me to take him
to his mom's grave.

74
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:28,819
I'm headed that way for research.
Get in. I'll give you a ride.

75
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,560
Great. Thank you.

76
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:33,319
I needed to interview him,

77
00:07:34,459 --> 00:07:36,829
so I had no choice but to say yes.

78
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,569
I heard that's where...

79
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:51,709
the 10th Suseong serial victim was found.

80
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:54,050
It's not this way.

81
00:07:54,449 --> 00:07:57,250
Is it not? I must've taken a wrong turn.

82
00:07:57,449 --> 00:07:58,550
Can we take a detour?

83
00:07:59,449 --> 00:08:01,550
Why not? I have time to kill.

84
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:06,689
Are you hungry? There's a bag
under your chair. Eat what you want.

85
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:10,560
Oh, nice. Thank you.

86
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:19,870
Why?

87
00:08:19,939 --> 00:08:22,839
Does it bring back memories?

88
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,079
What do you mean?

89
00:08:29,649 --> 00:08:31,220
It's you, punk.

90
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,289
Why did you go on your own?

91
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,149
How did you find out?

92
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,950
I tried to be a good person.

93
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:11,289
Why do people keep irritating me?

94
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,629
You tried to be good?

95
00:09:16,129 --> 00:09:18,700
That's hard to believe.

96
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:19,860
What?

97
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:22,870
How dare you?

98
00:09:37,549 --> 00:09:38,720
Did you see him?

99
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,789
I couldn't see anything.

100
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,649
I was gagged then.

101
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:46,120
And I was unconscious.

102
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:58,570
Hey, Officer Jung.
Lee Jae Shik will be released today.

103
00:09:58,669 --> 00:10:01,509
But I heard that it'll be put off
a little while because something came up.

104
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:04,980
I need to interview him.
Can you send me Dong Goo's number?

105
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:07,950
Sure. I'll send you his number right away.

106
00:10:22,129 --> 00:10:24,029
What if Ms. Choi gets in danger?

107
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,110
I should move up the time.

108
00:10:51,389 --> 00:10:54,759
It has been confirmed that the confession
of Mr. A in the video clip was true.

109
00:10:54,789 --> 00:10:58,000
The police found the victims' belongings
in the mountain...

110
00:10:58,029 --> 00:11:00,200
The video clip was sent by the killer
of Mr. A,

111
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:03,529
and it vindicated Kim Bong Cheol
who was wrongfully convicted.

112
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,740
As the killer of the real culprit
of Suseong serial murders...

113
00:11:06,769 --> 00:11:09,340
is called "Judging Man" and "Dark Hero"
by the public...

114
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:12,110
receiving a wildly positive response,
Cheong Wa Dae...

115
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:14,779
He said that personal revenge is
an unacceptable, serious crime...

116
00:11:14,909 --> 00:11:18,320
that can shake the foundation
of the constitutional state.

117
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,519
The President ordered the police...

118
00:11:20,549 --> 00:11:23,490
to devote all their might
to catch the culprit.

119
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:34,929
I'm feeling out of sorts.

120
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:38,539
Why am I getting downcast?

121
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:41,309
It felt great last time.

122
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,210
You're nothing but
a psychopathic serial killer!

123
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:00,830
I'm not the person you know.

124
00:12:01,289 --> 00:12:03,090
He did it because of me.

125
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,370
He did it for me.

126
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:10,470
It's about Mr. Go.

127
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,570
Did you like him before?

128
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:16,139
I asked him out.
I told him that I liked him.

129
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,210
But he rejected me in one second.

130
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,809
The timing wasn't right.

131
00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:24,980
It was right after Detective Go decided
to kill Han Seo Joon.

132
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:28,019
He pushed me away
because he didn't want to make...

133
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,350
my life miserable.

134
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:37,559
I'm sure that's how Ba Reum feels.

135
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,759
Just like Mr. Go.

136
00:13:01,289 --> 00:13:02,389
Get out for a second.

137
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:10,590
This is the neighborhood
I lived in when I was little.

138
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,830
Come with me.

139
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:30,850
Hold my hand.

140
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:37,049
Oh, my. What's all this?

141
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:41,990
I heard you had asked for your own hideout
for a Christmas gift.

142
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,059
What?

143
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,360
Your father made this
as a surprise Christmas gift for you.

144
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:51,000
The day you woke up late at night...

145
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,799
It was the night of Christmas Eve, right?

146
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,940
You said that your father had been
soaked with rain and sweat,

147
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:00,210
and his pants had been covered
with mud and grass.

148
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:03,750
This is the reason why he looked like that
that night.

149
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:07,950
Because he... Because he built this?

150
00:14:12,889 --> 00:14:14,490
I didn't even know that.

151
00:14:15,529 --> 00:14:18,929
My gosh. I'm so sorry to him.

152
00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:22,899
I feel so bad for my dad.

153
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,970
It's okay.

154
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,610
My poor dad.

155
00:14:28,669 --> 00:14:31,279
Now, the groom will enter.

156
00:14:31,379 --> 00:14:33,340
Please give him a warm round of applause
to congratulate him.

157
00:14:33,379 --> 00:14:35,009
Here comes the groom.

158
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:48,789
Look at you.

159
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:51,500
- Are you happy?
- Yes.

160
00:14:54,529 --> 00:14:58,899
And now, the bride, the star of the day,
will enter.

161
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:02,070
I heard that Detective Shin Sang
chased her for five years.

162
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:04,110
He's finally getting married to her today.

163
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:05,879
Here comes the bride.

164
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,600
I'm sorry, Dad.

165
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,769
Don't cry.

166
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,600
How did he come out?

167
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,909
I thought he could come out
after the trial ended.

168
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:11,679
He got a temporary release.

169
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:16,309
If it hadn't been for that person,
he wouldn't be here now.

170
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:19,019
Your innocence has finally been proved.
Why would you want to die?

171
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:23,789
Darn it.

172
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,860
(He...)

173
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,330
(confessed.)

174
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,769
Come on. Listen to me.

175
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:40,139
Look. Look what I wrote down there.
Mr. Kim, look.

176
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,610
(He confessed.)

177
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:46,940
Help!

178
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:51,419
He saved Mr. Kim.

179
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,820
He saved Mr. Kim and his daughter.

180
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:55,590
Whoever that is.

181
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,869
- Aunt.
- Hey.

182
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:14,839
I didn't come over just for a few days
and look at this mess.

183
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:17,240
What would you do without me?

184
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:19,579
Are you not mad at me anymore?

185
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,509
I hope you didn't scold Hoon Seok
too harshly.

186
00:17:24,779 --> 00:17:27,220
My husband has been transferred
to the office in the US.

187
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:28,549
I decided to go with him.

188
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,519
Oh, really?

189
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:32,720
That's great news. When will you move?

190
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:34,859
Apparently, he should start working there
right away.

191
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:38,799
I have so many things to do,
but I haven't done any of those.

192
00:17:38,859 --> 00:17:41,730
I should put my house out on the market
and pack our stuff.

193
00:17:42,869 --> 00:17:45,700
Anyway, I'm worried about you.

194
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,339
Don't worry about me. I'll be fine.

195
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:53,839
Oh, it's time already.

196
00:17:54,009 --> 00:17:55,779
- I should go now.
- Okay.

197
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,119
I left Hoon Seok
with my next door neighbor.

198
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:06,259
- Aunt.
- Yes?

199
00:18:06,589 --> 00:18:07,660
By any chance...

200
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:13,400
Can Hoon Seok raise that kitten?

201
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:16,200
He seemed to like it
when he came over the other day.

202
00:18:18,099 --> 00:18:19,200
Sure.

203
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:21,970
Hoon Seok will feel lonely
living in a foreign country.

204
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:24,779
- He could use some company.
- Yes.

205
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:54,910
(Bong Yi)

206
00:19:11,019 --> 00:19:13,890
The person you have reached
is not available.

207
00:19:17,029 --> 00:19:19,299
He pushed me away
because he didn't want to make...

208
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:21,000
my life miserable.

209
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,500
If he pushes me away, I'll pull him in.

210
00:19:38,849 --> 00:19:39,819
Bong...

211
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:55,730
(Bong Yi)

212
00:20:03,109 --> 00:20:04,710
(Bong Yi)

213
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,210
Hello?

214
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:10,779
I'm in Wonnam-dong to do some research,

215
00:20:10,849 --> 00:20:13,079
- and there's a killer burrito place.
- Hey.

216
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:16,789
Shall I get some?
Shall we have lunch together?

217
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:19,059
I'm busy. I'm elsewhere for work.

218
00:20:20,859 --> 00:20:21,990
When will you be back?

219
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:24,799
I don't mind. I have lots of time
and can wait.

220
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,700
Don't wait. I'll be late.

221
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:30,269
It's fine. I can wait.

222
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:33,539
It's not fine.

223
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:38,509
Okay, then. Bye.

224
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:42,980
But Ba Reum.

225
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:47,650
I don't care if
you're the person I know or not.

226
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:51,420
Whoever you are and whatever you're like,

227
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:54,019
I like you.

228
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,460
That's what I wanted to say.

229
00:21:02,269 --> 00:21:05,599
I wanted to say it to your face,
but I said it over the phone.

230
00:21:07,539 --> 00:21:08,839
Bye.

231
00:21:12,279 --> 00:21:13,509
Did you two fight?

232
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,849
What's wrong? You were so close
I couldn't stand the sweetness.

233
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:23,990
She'll become unhappy if she's around me.

234
00:21:25,089 --> 00:21:27,059
She shouldn't suffer anymore.

235
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:29,130
Why would you say that?

236
00:21:29,529 --> 00:21:31,630
Why would Bong Yi
become unhappy around you?

237
00:21:33,099 --> 00:21:35,400
She's waiting outside to see you.

238
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,710
I don't know why you got that idea,

239
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,980
but I once thought so.

240
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:51,819
What would've happened to me
if I'd accepted her advances?

241
00:21:52,619 --> 00:21:54,920
Would I be living a different life now?

242
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:59,559
Would I have a family,
a kid, plans for retirement,

243
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:01,220
and dreams of owning a house?

244
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:03,859
Would I be living like that?

245
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:07,529
Do you regret it?

246
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:09,700
Regret?

247
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:13,140
Regret...

248
00:22:14,769 --> 00:22:17,710
I can't stop now. I have to keep going.

249
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,240
I have nowhere to turn back to.

250
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,950
Don't do anything you'll regret.

251
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:33,990
Yes. Perhaps my life might change.

252
00:22:35,029 --> 00:22:37,859
If I'm with Bong Yi,
I might be able to go back to...

253
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,759
the real me, Jung Ba Reum.

254
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:58,150
- Ba Reum?
- Tomorrow evening.

255
00:22:59,349 --> 00:23:00,779
Shall we eat together?

256
00:23:03,789 --> 00:23:04,920
Aren't you busy?

257
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:08,559
I'm not busy from now on.

258
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:15,029
Let's go to the burrito place
you want to go to.

259
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,309
Go on home so you don't catch a cold.

260
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:38,490
I will get through this.

261
00:23:39,789 --> 00:23:42,529
Bong Yi. Give me strength.

262
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:45,130
Protect me.

263
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:02,650
Bong Yi. When you grow up, marry me.

264
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:21,970
(Sherlock Hong Ju,
Staff Writer Oh Bong Yi)

265
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,339
Thank you. I'll work really hard.

266
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:27,670
- Good luck.
- Gosh.

267
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:36,809
(Sherlock Hong Ju,
Staff Writer Oh Bong Yi)

268
00:24:40,849 --> 00:24:42,690
Hi, Ba Reum. You're here?

269
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:45,390
The traffic's bad. I'm ten minutes out.

270
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:47,220
Okay. Call me when you arrive.

271
00:24:48,259 --> 00:24:51,130
I knew it when you came to work
all dressed up.

272
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:53,200
I envy you.

273
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:56,430
Hello?

274
00:24:58,029 --> 00:24:59,240
Oh, a tip?

275
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,970
It's that kid again. The troublemaker.

276
00:25:02,269 --> 00:25:03,569
The troublemaker?

277
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:06,680
Great Detective Conan?
Hang up after a while.

278
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:11,109
That's not the right topic for our show.

279
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:13,349
Why don't you call "Animal Farm"?

280
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:17,650
What? It's late. Go home already.

281
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,859
Your mom will be worried.

282
00:25:20,289 --> 00:25:22,630
My gosh. He's in the lobby.

283
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:25,130
I guess he came to complain that
we blocked his ID.

284
00:25:26,029 --> 00:25:27,559
He's really brazen.

285
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:30,400
Great Detective Conan?

286
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:36,369
(Kang Deok Soo, Lee Jae Shik,
Killed By The Same Person?)

287
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:55,160
I made a bad choice.

288
00:25:58,059 --> 00:26:00,099
Is it right to use him like this?

289
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:07,569
Yes. It should be ended this way.

290
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,609
So, for classmate Kkot Nim's sake,

291
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,779
you want to help the old lady?

292
00:26:19,549 --> 00:26:22,390
Good for you.
You're a really great detective.

293
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:26,319
Since we're talking,
I'll tell you why I'm here.

294
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:29,990
- Why?
- I identified the cat killer.

295
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:33,599
Did you really? Well done, Detective.

296
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,269
Who is it?

297
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:38,869
How I found out
is more important than the who.

298
00:26:39,339 --> 00:26:40,799
That's the Conan spirit.

299
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:42,569
Okay, right. How did you find...

300
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,309
- How did you find out?
- I found evidence.

301
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:51,450
Crucial evidence. I have it.

302
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:52,849
The evidence?

303
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,319
But this is where it gets serious.

304
00:26:55,619 --> 00:26:57,920
The truth that's
more shocking than the cat killing.

305
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:59,420
There's only one truth.

306
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:00,789
Bong Yi.

307
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:02,990
Ba Reum.

308
00:27:06,329 --> 00:27:09,970
Say hello.
He is the Great Detective Conan.

309
00:27:10,299 --> 00:27:11,369
Hello.

310
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:13,400
You have a date?

311
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:17,569
I shouldn't get in the way, then.
See you again.

312
00:27:20,779 --> 00:27:21,750
Kid.

313
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:25,779
(Grade 5 Class 9, Myeong Go Nam)

314
00:27:26,049 --> 00:27:27,250
You forgot your bag.

315
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:31,150
Get home safely.

316
00:27:33,019 --> 00:27:34,059
Who was that?

317
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:35,890
He called with a tip.

318
00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:37,859
His classmate's grandmother is...

319
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:40,059
rumored to be going around killing cats.

320
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:42,599
So the kid's being bullied.

321
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:45,299
He said he identified the cat killer...

322
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:46,869
and even has evidence.

323
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,269
Excuse me.

324
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,779
Hello?

325
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,750
- I have dinner plans...
- It's important.

326
00:27:57,079 --> 00:27:58,079
Come here now.

327
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:00,549
What...

328
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:02,289
Hello?

329
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:06,220
Was it your office? Is it urgent?

330
00:28:08,089 --> 00:28:09,230
Yes.

331
00:28:09,589 --> 00:28:12,200
Then we can have dinner some other time.

332
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:15,369
I just had cake
and don't have an appetite.

333
00:28:15,869 --> 00:28:18,029
I think I have indigestion too.

334
00:28:22,769 --> 00:28:26,480
I didn't eat all day to eat with Ba Reum
and now I'm starving.

335
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:40,390
The rerun of "Amazing Saturday"
should be on.

336
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:48,829
Why is Shin Dong Yeob always so bad?

337
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:50,130
Are his ears accessories?

338
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:00,539
I have something to tell you.
Can we rendezvous tomorrow?

339
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:02,180
He's so cute.

340
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,980
(I'll wait outside your school
when you get out.)

341
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:22,269
- Make sure to come alone.
- Alone?

342
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:25,339
(Ba Reum)

343
00:29:29,069 --> 00:29:31,339
- Hi, Ba Reum.
- Are you feeling any better?

344
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,950
I'm fine now.
The upset stomach has gone away.

345
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:37,880
I'm relieved.

346
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:39,849
I'm sorry for today.

347
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:42,289
I'll treat you to a nice meal tomorrow.

348
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:44,490
Yes.

349
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:47,460
Make sure to eat something
before going to bed, okay?

350
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,460
Okay. Bye.

351
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,930
You have a date?

352
00:29:54,329 --> 00:29:56,900
I shouldn't get in the way, then.
See you again.

353
00:29:57,730 --> 00:29:59,339
What are you pondering on?

354
00:30:01,569 --> 00:30:03,039
Why did you ask for me?

355
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:09,549
Your next target.

356
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:13,420
You can just think of this person
as a top predator.

357
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,250
I've been thinking about this for a while.

358
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:21,160
Someone is helping you, right?

359
00:30:22,059 --> 00:30:25,059
Did that person bring you
this person's DNA...

360
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:26,630
and ask you to kill this person?

361
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,140
I heard that you had been adopted
by British parents when you were little,

362
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:33,400
and that you had been raised in the UK.

363
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,609
And you're officially dead now.

364
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:40,710
There's no way you could get
all this equipment and food.

365
00:30:42,609 --> 00:30:44,509
Who is helping you?

366
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:46,450
You don't need to know.

367
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,589
You're such a mysterious man.

368
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:53,059
I mean, you're
an internationally renowned geneticist.

369
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,759
I don't understand why you're hiding
at a place like this...

370
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:00,029
and why you faked your death.

371
00:31:04,299 --> 00:31:06,039
You're being chased by someone.

372
00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:08,400
Am I right?

373
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:11,410
You'll know everything
when the right time comes.

374
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:12,579
So wait.

375
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,579
The right time?

376
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:20,380
I don't know when that will be,

377
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,690
but I'll wait.

378
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:26,390
Don't give me a list like this anymore.

379
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:28,359
I'm the one to decide...

380
00:31:29,089 --> 00:31:30,359
my own target.

381
00:31:44,509 --> 00:31:45,680
Of course, I know him.

382
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:48,079
He's like a fixer of this school.

383
00:31:48,109 --> 00:31:50,650
He even caught the thief
who stole my money too.

384
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:53,380
But the classes are not over yet.

385
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:55,849
Oh, it's over.

386
00:31:56,019 --> 00:31:57,289
Hello.

387
00:31:57,549 --> 00:31:59,720
Hey, you're here. Just a second.

388
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,089
You always work too hard.

389
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:04,730
Why don't you take it easy?

390
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:09,569
See you later. Bye.

391
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:18,680
Oh, no. Ma'am, stop.

392
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,210
You should leave. Ma'am, stop.

393
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:21,880
Ma'am.

394
00:32:22,609 --> 00:32:23,880
Why?

395
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:26,220
Goodness. Ma'am.

396
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:28,250
You should leave.

397
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:38,660
Gosh, that writer.
I told her to come alone.

398
00:32:46,269 --> 00:32:48,099
Have his class ended already?

399
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,170
Why won't he pick up?

400
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:52,240
(Nari Elementary School)

401
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:54,839
Kid, do you happen to know Myeong Go Nam?

402
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,549
I saw him in the corridor on my way out.

403
00:32:57,049 --> 00:32:59,250
Oh, I see. Thank you.

404
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,960
Oh, hey, Go Nam, where are you?

405
00:33:18,369 --> 00:33:20,900
(No entry without permission)

406
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:22,309
Did I miss him?

407
00:33:25,009 --> 00:33:26,180
Move! Get out of the way!

408
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:27,710
My gosh. Go Nam.

409
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:29,210
Please be okay.

410
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:35,950
Four cats.

411
00:33:36,019 --> 00:33:39,160
Four cats.

412
00:33:40,789 --> 00:33:41,859
What...

413
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:47,400
No. This can't be happening.

414
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:53,339
Goodness gracious.

415
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,940
If Go Nam dies, I'll die too.

416
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:59,339
Today, I'm going to tell you...

417
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:02,079
about an unfortunate accident
that happened to a child detective...

418
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:05,950
who investigated a case to help to prove
his classmate's grandmother's innocence.

419
00:34:06,579 --> 00:34:08,750
The child detective was in the cafeteria.

420
00:34:08,789 --> 00:34:10,289
As the cabinet next to him swayed,

421
00:34:10,349 --> 00:34:13,719
the undiluted cleaning detergent
on top of it was poured on him,

422
00:34:14,289 --> 00:34:16,389
and he got chemical burns
all over his body.

423
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:20,960
The school didn't lock the cafeteria doors
in the first place.

424
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:24,599
Anyone could enter the cafeteria.

425
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:27,369
Nevertheless, the school is still...

426
00:34:27,469 --> 00:34:29,940
- avoiding taking responsibility.
- That's weird.

427
00:34:29,969 --> 00:34:31,409
- They're blaming the child...
- Pardon?

428
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,210
I don't think it's just an accident.

429
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,539
(The school where everyone is happy)

430
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:42,690
She said that this cabinet fell,
and the detergent poured out.

431
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:43,590
Yes.

432
00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:45,320
If that's the case,
it would've spread more widely...

433
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:47,119
because of the quantity of motion
of the cabinet.

434
00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:48,760
But look.

435
00:34:48,789 --> 00:34:50,559
The bleached area seems too small.

436
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:52,960
Did someone pour it over his head?

437
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,230
Someone poured it on that kid to kill him.

438
00:34:56,829 --> 00:34:59,699
What kind of scum
did such a horrible thing to a kid?

439
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,099
We should catch that scum.

440
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:03,670
Whoever that crazy scum is.

441
00:35:08,409 --> 00:35:09,550
Ma'am!

442
00:35:10,409 --> 00:35:11,849
Please stop, ma'am!

443
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:13,650
- Come on, ma'am!
- Oh, dear.

444
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:37,809
Hey, Bong Yi.

445
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,739
About the footage of the cafeteria
that aired.

446
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:41,909
When did you record it?

447
00:35:42,679 --> 00:35:44,809
The next morning of Go Nam's accident?

448
00:35:45,619 --> 00:35:46,679
Okay. Thank you.

449
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:51,320
- I'll go and check the CCTV.
- Okay.

450
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:54,820
Did anyone organize or clean up here...

451
00:35:55,019 --> 00:35:57,190
after the accident?

452
00:35:57,559 --> 00:35:59,800
No. This place was blocked off
right after that happened.

453
00:35:59,829 --> 00:36:02,929
No one touched anything in here
as the police said.

454
00:36:02,969 --> 00:36:04,099
I see.

455
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:05,670
Please excuse me.

456
00:36:10,369 --> 00:36:13,409
The culprit came by
after Ms. Choi came for the shoot.

457
00:36:14,579 --> 00:36:16,949
Why did the culprit come back
and touch the objects on the shelves?

458
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,940
It's mine.

459
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,769
That's evidence. You shouldn't touch it...

460
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,239
- Please give it to me.
- Hangs off. It's mine.

461
00:36:43,269 --> 00:36:44,269
Ma'am.

462
00:36:44,309 --> 00:36:45,309
Ma'am.

463
00:36:45,909 --> 00:36:48,179
How do we get to your house from here?

464
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,750
What? Officer Jung.

465
00:36:51,949 --> 00:36:54,280
It's been a long time.
Don't you remember me?

466
00:36:54,449 --> 00:36:56,250
We worked together at Gudong Substation.

467
00:36:56,849 --> 00:37:00,389
- Officer Kim?
- Oh, my. You remember me.

468
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:03,360
I heard that you lost your memory
because of the surgery.

469
00:37:03,389 --> 00:37:05,260
I've regained almost all of my memory.

470
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:07,460
- Except for my childhood.
- I'm glad to hear that.

471
00:37:09,699 --> 00:37:12,699
Ma'am, did you go to the school
with a lunch box again?

472
00:37:13,969 --> 00:37:16,769
She always says that her granddaughter
forgot her lunch box...

473
00:37:16,809 --> 00:37:19,340
and goes to her school every single day
with that empty lunch box.

474
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,380
I mean, kids eat school meals these days.

475
00:37:21,409 --> 00:37:23,750
Could you lead the way?
I don't know where she lives.

476
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:25,780
Let's go, ma'am. I'll take you home.

477
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:27,519
Let's go. This way.

478
00:37:28,349 --> 00:37:29,420
Let's go, ma'am.

479
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:37,159
Darn it. It's a fake camera.

480
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,630
Why would they hang it up there
when it doesn't even work?

481
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,179
The lady didn't seem quite lucid.

482
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:57,480
Not long ago, she walked around
the whole neighborhood...

483
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:59,519
holding a dead stray cat in her arms.

484
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:01,619
People called her a senile old lady,

485
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:04,849
and whispered that she had killed cats
by giving it pesticide.

486
00:38:04,889 --> 00:38:06,559
Oh, she's the lady...

487
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,530
- whom Go Nam talked about.
- Did you hear about her?

488
00:38:09,559 --> 00:38:11,789
However, I don't believe
that she did such a thing...

489
00:38:11,829 --> 00:38:13,960
just as Go Nam said.

490
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,329
Do you remember?

491
00:38:15,429 --> 00:38:18,329
There was a cat killer in Gudong
a while back.

492
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:20,139
He even pulled out their teeth.

493
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:28,739
I think he moved here.

494
00:38:28,809 --> 00:38:32,719
That cat she was carrying
had no teeth either.

495
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,250
It had no teeth?

496
00:38:35,619 --> 00:38:36,820
Attempted murder?

497
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,489
Check this out.

498
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:43,929
This spatter isn't accidental.
The culprit poured it over him.

499
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:46,900
See? You guys didn't carry out
a proper investigation, did you?

500
00:38:47,059 --> 00:38:49,269
What did you say? You little...

501
00:38:49,329 --> 00:38:52,670
Who are you to meddle in our jurisdiction?

502
00:38:52,739 --> 00:38:56,239
You should be apologizing.
How dare you raise your voice at me?

503
00:38:56,309 --> 00:38:59,780
- Darn it!
- All right. We'll check it out.

504
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:03,550
This is an attempted murder case,
so submit the evidence right away. Got it?

505
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:08,179
That little...

506
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:14,090
Didn't that old lady say...

507
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:16,760
that she saw him running away
from the cafeteria?

508
00:39:16,829 --> 00:39:18,960
Who's going to believe
a demented, old woman?

509
00:39:19,159 --> 00:39:21,500
There's no point in investigating.
It won't be accepted as evidence.

510
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:24,170
But she was sane when she told us.

511
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:25,940
Her testimony was very detailed as well.

512
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,070
Just let sleeping dogs lie, okay?

513
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:31,070
Do you think he'd do that to a kid?

514
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:33,380
He's a good, young man.

515
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:39,750
(Have You Witnessed This Assault?)

516
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:43,619
Four cats.

517
00:39:44,619 --> 00:39:47,159
All the objects are organized
to the right.

518
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,590
Officer Nam, who put up these flyers?

519
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:53,429
The Cat Dad.

520
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,460
The Cat Dad?

521
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:58,170
- Hello.
- Excuse me, sir.

522
00:39:59,139 --> 00:40:02,239
I'm with the police.
I'd like to ask you some questions...

523
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:03,369
about the incident
at Nari Elementary School.

524
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:06,110
I've already told the police everything.

525
00:40:06,309 --> 00:40:08,980
I'd like to hear it again.
Could you explain what had happened?

526
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:10,780
You see...

527
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:15,219
We deliver meat to that school.

528
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:20,019
That day, I was taking out the meat
from my truck as usual.

529
00:40:21,389 --> 00:40:23,260
I was startled and rushed over.

530
00:40:23,329 --> 00:40:25,630
- Go Nam.
- No! You'll hurt yourself!

531
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:27,800
I didn't want her to get a burn,

532
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:30,530
so I pushed her away
and covered him with my clothes.

533
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:32,230
Then I put him on my back and rushed out.

534
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,539
He runs a butcher shop
near the three-way intersection.

535
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,739
He's the one who put the boy on his back
and ran.

536
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:37,840
- Move aside!
- Don't die!

537
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:49,690
Hello. What would you like?

538
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:52,489
My friends and I are going to have
a barbecue party tonight.

539
00:40:53,289 --> 00:40:55,519
- I'm not sure what to buy.
- That's great.

540
00:40:55,929 --> 00:40:58,090
- Look around.
- Okay.

541
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:11,739
What is this cut?

542
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:13,510
It's chuck flap tail.

543
00:41:13,739 --> 00:41:16,550
It melts in your mouth.

544
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:19,980
But since it's a small cut,
it's a bit expensive.

545
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:22,119
If you're having a lot of friends over,
just buy pork.

546
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,090
It's actually tastier.

547
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:36,000
Hemispatial neglect?

548
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:38,269
What is that?

549
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:40,840
When the right side of your parietal lobe
is damaged,

550
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:44,210
you could become dull
regarding the other side's vision, touch,

551
00:41:44,269 --> 00:41:45,980
and hearing.

552
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:49,780
In severe cases, you may only eat
the food...

553
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,150
that's on the right side of a plate.

554
00:41:52,519 --> 00:41:55,650
You may also apply makeup or shave
only the right side of your face.

555
00:42:03,929 --> 00:42:04,960
Ma'am.

556
00:42:05,829 --> 00:42:06,829
- What a surprise.
- Hello.

557
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,130
Ba Reum, what brings you here?

558
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:09,800
Shouldn't you be working?

559
00:42:09,869 --> 00:42:11,429
I was investigating a case nearby...

560
00:42:11,469 --> 00:42:13,469
then decided to swing by
and visit Chi Gook.

561
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,539
I'm sorry
I haven't been coming here often.

562
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:19,010
That's okay. I know you're busy.

563
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:22,909
Chi Gook, Ba Reum's here.

564
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:35,219
Dong Goo and I got this CD
from the detention center.

565
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:39,130
He said Chi Gook's father
enjoyed this music.

566
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:41,360
That's right.

567
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:45,070
I guess you can even remember that.

568
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:48,170
You're all better now.

569
00:42:50,409 --> 00:42:51,469
Ma'am.

570
00:42:51,809 --> 00:42:54,480
Chi Gook will regain consciousness soon.

571
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:58,849
One minute.

572
00:43:06,789 --> 00:43:08,820
I need to pack some lunch...

573
00:43:09,559 --> 00:43:12,190
for my puppy.

574
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:25,309
Hey, old lady.

575
00:43:25,809 --> 00:43:28,239
I heard you told the police
that you saw me running away.

576
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,780
Why did you tell them such a thing?

577
00:43:32,579 --> 00:43:35,679
I'm nice enough to give you
extra fat every day.

578
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:39,719
How dare you tell on me?

579
00:43:40,519 --> 00:43:42,119
Meat.

580
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:46,360
Kkot Nim likes meat.

581
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:50,300
It's no use.

582
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:53,340
Who'll believe a demented, old woman?

583
00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:57,869
Give me that. I'll put this in there.

584
00:44:07,579 --> 00:44:09,050
So this is where it was.

585
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:13,320
I've been looking for this everywhere.

586
00:44:18,659 --> 00:44:19,860
(Needs Absolute Rest)

587
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:23,369
The nurse lent this to me.

588
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:28,739
Chi Gook.

589
00:44:29,639 --> 00:44:31,670
Do you remember this music?

590
00:44:33,739 --> 00:44:36,679
I'm slowly regaining my memories
from high school.

591
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:42,380
We played this music on repeat
during that camping trip.

592
00:44:44,889 --> 00:44:46,559
Dong Goo visited us yesterday...

593
00:44:46,889 --> 00:44:49,219
and said Chi Gook appeared in his dreams.

594
00:44:49,489 --> 00:44:51,889
He said that? What was it about?

595
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:55,460
Chi Gook had introduced his girlfriend
to him.

596
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:56,599
Okay.

597
00:45:34,670 --> 00:45:37,239
- Insecticide?
- Everyone claimed...

598
00:45:37,409 --> 00:45:39,739
that the demented woman had killed
those cats by feeding them insecticide.

599
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:42,139
This is the detergent
that was in the cafeteria.

600
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:49,550
These keys...

601
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:52,849
Did he take them from her?

602
00:47:00,789 --> 00:47:04,329
If he was rummaging through the shelves,
he was probably looking for something.

603
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:07,429
Was this it?

604
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:11,300
- What is this?
- That cat she was carrying had...

605
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,500
no teeth either.

606
00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:16,769
He said he identified the cat killer
and even has evidence.

607
00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:19,210
It's a cat's tooth.

608
00:47:19,639 --> 00:47:22,280
Go Nam knew that this was a cat tooth.

609
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,909
That's how he knew
that Kim Byeong Tae had killed them.

610
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:28,349
When Kim Byeong Tae found out,
he attempted to kill the boy?

611
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,650
He went so far as to kill the boy
solely because of those cats?

612
00:47:34,789 --> 00:47:36,659
What are these keys for?

613
00:47:50,570 --> 00:47:52,239
They were for this music box.

614
00:48:06,989 --> 00:48:08,090
What are these?

615
00:48:10,059 --> 00:48:11,590
What were they burning?

616
00:48:25,139 --> 00:48:26,710
(Child burned alive)

617
00:48:28,809 --> 00:48:30,050
(Is This the End?
Child Burned in Gasoline)

618
00:48:37,219 --> 00:48:39,019
(Victim identified
as 6-year-old Hwang Min Ji)

619
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:42,860
Six-year-old Hwang Min Ji.

620
00:48:43,429 --> 00:48:45,130
Died after suffering from burns
all over her body.

621
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:49,300
The victim's friend,
who had an intellectual disability,

622
00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:52,199
pointed at two men
who worked at a nearby gas station.

623
00:48:52,829 --> 00:48:56,039
But she wasn't found credible
due to her disability,

624
00:48:56,070 --> 00:48:57,369
and the men were excluded
from being suspects.

625
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:00,380
Before Min Ji had died,

626
00:49:00,409 --> 00:49:02,639
she had stated that the culprits
wore red clothes.

627
00:49:04,849 --> 00:49:07,619
Since there was no firm evidence
or motive...

628
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:09,119
that would prove Han Soo Cheol guilty,

629
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:11,090
he was removed as a suspect.

630
00:49:11,349 --> 00:49:12,949
It has remained a cold case.

631
00:49:13,619 --> 00:49:15,289
She was adopted at first.

632
00:49:15,659 --> 00:49:19,460
But after her testimony,
she was called to testify many times...

633
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:21,130
and was sent back.

634
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:25,469
The parents said it was because
she caused unnecessary trouble.

635
00:49:26,170 --> 00:49:29,039
She's been here ever since.

636
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:33,710
The file said
that she had an intellectual disability.

637
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:37,309
That's not true. Angela is deaf.

638
00:49:37,449 --> 00:49:39,780
She finds it difficult to pronounce words,

639
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:41,780
but her intelligence is fine.

640
00:49:42,019 --> 00:49:45,090
But due to the difficulty
in talking with her,

641
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:47,820
I guess the police concluded
that she had an intellectual disability.

642
00:49:53,059 --> 00:49:54,199
Angela.

643
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:05,369
It's not him. It's not my brother.

644
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,539
He didn't keep his promise.

645
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:11,380
- He will come. Don't you worry, okay?
- It's not my brother.

646
00:50:11,849 --> 00:50:13,780
It's just taking some time.

647
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:15,250
What's wrong?

648
00:50:17,219 --> 00:50:21,019
I think Mikaela is hurt.

649
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:22,960
- It's not him.
- Last year,

650
00:50:23,019 --> 00:50:25,630
her older brother had visited her twice.

651
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:29,460
During his second visit, he had promised
to take her home next time he came.

652
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:34,869
But I didn't expect it to be him.

653
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:35,969
Him?

654
00:50:37,239 --> 00:50:38,369
Never mind.

655
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:44,110
(Do you remember the testimony...)

656
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:46,449
(you had given to the police
a long time ago?)

657
00:50:47,849 --> 00:50:50,050
(Can you tell him?)

658
00:50:55,690 --> 00:51:00,559
(Is he a police officer?
They just won't believe me.)

659
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:01,659
Wait.

660
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:04,630
You can trust me.

661
00:51:05,030 --> 00:51:06,329
Trust me...

662
00:51:07,269 --> 00:51:08,599
and tell me what happened.

663
00:51:15,010 --> 00:51:17,610
When I was little...

664
00:51:17,650 --> 00:51:19,780
- I'm sorry.
- That was intentional, wasn't it?

665
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:21,619
- No.
- Do you not know numbers?

666
00:51:21,719 --> 00:51:23,320
- I do.
- Then...

667
00:51:23,889 --> 00:51:25,889
Hey, go work.

668
00:51:26,190 --> 00:51:27,889
You're unbelievable.

669
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:31,230
Goodness.

670
00:51:31,889 --> 00:51:34,130
- Sir, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

671
00:51:34,159 --> 00:51:36,099
My worker kept miscalculating.

672
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:38,000
I'll remember your face.

673
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:40,369
Next time you come,
I'll give you a free car wash.

674
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,769
I'm sorry, sir. Here.

675
00:51:44,469 --> 00:51:45,469
Two of them?

676
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:47,809
What kind of scumbags harm kids?

677
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:50,050
Those who do that are psychopaths.

678
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:52,980
Those who kill, sexually assault,
or abuse kids. All of them.

679
00:51:54,179 --> 00:51:56,119
They gave up being human.

680
00:51:56,449 --> 00:51:59,960
Two days ago,
A suffered from severe burns...

681
00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:03,090
when a bottle of detergent fell on him
in the school cafeteria.

682
00:52:05,289 --> 00:52:06,360
Darn it.

683
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:07,500
Go Nam.

684
00:52:08,099 --> 00:52:10,929
Had that wench not appeared,

685
00:52:10,969 --> 00:52:13,070
that kid would've been long dead.

686
00:52:24,110 --> 00:52:25,280
He'll wake up.

687
00:52:25,949 --> 00:52:27,150
Don't worry too much.

688
00:52:28,519 --> 00:52:29,719
Will he be okay?

689
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,789
They're both predators.

690
00:53:20,769 --> 00:53:21,840
Darn it.

691
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:39,090
That scumbag.

692
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:42,289
- That's...
- It's quite a severe burn.

693
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:44,960
He probably wouldn't have been able
to scream, right?

694
00:53:44,989 --> 00:53:46,599
Of course not.

695
00:53:46,630 --> 00:53:47,960
His respiratory tract
was completely damaged.

696
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:51,469
I heard him screaming from the cafeteria.

697
00:53:51,530 --> 00:53:53,539
That filthy scumbag.

698
00:54:05,809 --> 00:54:07,250
Who are you?

699
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:09,750
Let me go.

700
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:11,219
What are you doing?

701
00:54:11,949 --> 00:54:13,460
Do you want to steal all the fun?

702
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:17,260
- I should have fun too.
- You...

703
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:19,090
Help me!

704
00:54:19,230 --> 00:54:20,659
Help me!

705
00:54:20,699 --> 00:54:22,559
Go Nam was going around,

706
00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:25,170
trying to prove
his friend's grandmother's innocence.

707
00:54:26,599 --> 00:54:27,769
Then he saw this.

708
00:54:28,070 --> 00:54:32,139
And he instantly knew
that this was a cat's tooth.

709
00:54:33,170 --> 00:54:35,110
He told this to the police,

710
00:54:35,679 --> 00:54:38,380
but they didn't believe a little kid.

711
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:40,820
That's why he went to the TV station.

712
00:54:40,949 --> 00:54:43,449
Gosh, that writer.
I told her to come alone.

713
00:54:58,429 --> 00:55:02,440
(Bong Yi)

714
00:55:14,719 --> 00:55:17,349
The grandmother was fully sane
when she saw you...

715
00:55:17,389 --> 00:55:19,519
and when she gave her statement
to the police.

716
00:55:20,219 --> 00:55:21,590
Had the police...

717
00:55:22,090 --> 00:55:24,590
believed her and checked,

718
00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:26,429
you would've been arrested immediately.

719
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:28,760
Please spare me! Please!

720
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,429
But there's one thing I don't get.

721
00:55:31,769 --> 00:55:33,300
Why did you attempt...

722
00:55:33,329 --> 00:55:36,000
to kill that kid solely because
he found out...

723
00:55:36,070 --> 00:55:37,969
that you had killed those cats?

724
00:55:39,739 --> 00:55:42,909
Where in the world did that rat hide it?

725
00:55:46,719 --> 00:55:48,250
The secret behind these keys.

726
00:55:49,449 --> 00:55:50,690
That music box.

727
00:55:51,849 --> 00:55:53,190
The Pandora's box.

728
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:58,289
In 1999,

729
00:55:58,659 --> 00:56:00,929
a dog was burned to death...

730
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,429
near the school you
and Han Soo Cheol went to.

731
00:56:04,030 --> 00:56:05,800
They never found the culprit.

732
00:56:06,469 --> 00:56:08,269
The police didn't even bother
to investigate thoroughly...

733
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:10,440
because it was just an animal.

734
00:56:12,039 --> 00:56:13,980
So you became even bolder.

735
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:17,150
Killing animals became boring.
So this time,

736
00:56:17,710 --> 00:56:18,909
you targeted a human.

737
00:56:18,949 --> 00:56:21,079
Min Ji is my friend.

738
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:23,050
- A little girl at that.
- Min Ji.

739
00:56:23,079 --> 00:56:24,949
Then you two took this photo...

740
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:26,889
to remember the murder.

741
00:56:28,519 --> 00:56:31,159
But then, Go Nam took the keys...

742
00:56:32,659 --> 00:56:34,030
and saw these photos.

743
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,969
You had to kill him...

744
00:56:38,429 --> 00:56:41,769
before he could report it
to the TV station or the police.

745
00:56:48,409 --> 00:56:49,809
That was just one drop.

746
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:51,510
Is it already that painful?

747
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:53,980
Imagine how those kids must've felt.

748
00:56:54,349 --> 00:56:55,820
You can't fathom...

749
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:59,550
how their parents must've felt
after losing their kids, can you?

750
00:56:59,619 --> 00:57:02,260
A psychopath like you has no emotions.

751
00:57:02,289 --> 00:57:04,760
That's why you can't empathize
with anyone.

752
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:07,530
That's why you should get a taste
of your own medicine.

753
00:57:08,030 --> 00:57:09,230
An eye for an eye.

754
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,730
A tooth for a tooth.

755
00:57:14,199 --> 00:57:16,469
(Shinseon Wholesale Meats)

756
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:29,019
(Shinseon Wholesale Meats)

757
00:57:42,429 --> 00:57:43,460
Kim Byeong Tae.

758
00:58:45,590 --> 00:58:46,829
Kim Byeong Tae was killed.

759
00:58:47,130 --> 00:58:48,860
It's him.

760
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,969
He can't have gotten far.
Search all the alleys, quick.

761
00:58:52,099 --> 00:58:53,900
Kim, go that way. Park, this way.

762
00:58:53,969 --> 00:58:55,000
- Okay.
- Okay.

763
00:59:00,409 --> 00:59:03,280
You investigated a gasoline terror case
in May of 1999, right?

764
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:06,210
I just sent you a photo. Check it quick.

765
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:07,280
Was that your suspect?

766
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:09,179
- Yes, it's him.
- Who's the other guy?

767
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:11,650
He was a part-timer
at the gas station then.

768
00:59:12,190 --> 00:59:13,489
Han Soo Cheol's in danger too.

769
00:59:13,659 --> 00:59:16,360
Check if Han Soo Cheol's alive. Do it now!

770
00:59:18,230 --> 00:59:21,199
Wait. Will you hear me out first?

771
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:24,570
What did I do? What do you think I did?

772
00:59:24,670 --> 00:59:26,769
Who did I kill?

773
00:59:26,969 --> 00:59:28,840
Wait. It's not like that.

774
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,980
(A few days prior to
Kim Byeong Tae's murder)

775
00:59:48,789 --> 00:59:50,530
(Shinseon Wholesale Meats)

776
01:00:18,719 --> 01:00:21,019
- Hello?
- Who's this?

777
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:24,630
What? Who are you, then?

778
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:27,000
Are you Soo Cheol?

779
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:31,699
Kim Byeong Tae?

780
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:38,070
Why did you call me?

781
01:00:38,909 --> 01:00:40,210
Do you know my new number?

782
01:00:40,739 --> 01:00:41,739
Me?

783
01:00:44,210 --> 01:00:46,349
- I didn't call you.
- It's the truth.

784
01:00:46,510 --> 01:00:48,280
That's how we got in touch.

785
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:50,849
I said, "Let's meet up one day,"
and then we hung up.

786
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:52,949
Are you saying
you talked to a ghost, then?

787
01:00:53,019 --> 01:00:54,719
This is insane.

788
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:58,159
Oh, right. I can prove an alibi
for last night.

789
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:01,460
- Who's that?
- My gas station staff. Call and ask.

790
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:07,570
Hey.

791
01:01:09,469 --> 01:01:10,539
Yes?

792
01:01:14,239 --> 01:01:15,239
You're right.

793
01:01:16,010 --> 01:01:18,179
Your employee said he was with you.

794
01:01:19,949 --> 01:01:23,050
Then I'm in the clear, aren't I?

795
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:26,250
- Get these off me. Come on.
- Too bad, though.

796
01:01:27,219 --> 01:01:29,690
Your employee is mentally challenged.

797
01:01:30,289 --> 01:01:32,860
That means what? His statement won't help.

798
01:01:32,929 --> 01:01:35,929
You got off the hook many years ago
that way. What an irony.

799
01:01:36,199 --> 01:01:38,030
Now you're stuck with no way out.

800
01:01:38,699 --> 01:01:39,969
It wasn't me.

801
01:01:40,639 --> 01:01:41,940
It wasn't me!

802
01:01:46,469 --> 01:01:47,610
It was him.

803
01:01:48,179 --> 01:01:49,980
Lee Jae Shik and Kang Deok Soo's killer.

804
01:01:50,510 --> 01:01:53,880
It can't be.
All the evidence points to him.

805
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:57,449
Who kills a guy and leaves evidence
at his workplace?

806
01:01:58,289 --> 01:01:59,849
It was all set up.

807
01:02:01,659 --> 01:02:02,659
Was it?

808
01:02:03,489 --> 01:02:05,429
What I don't get is,

809
01:02:06,829 --> 01:02:08,429
why wasn't he killed too?

810
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:12,329
You're right.

811
01:02:20,710 --> 01:02:23,579
Kill him. Get rid of him.

812
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:28,050
He shows no remorse for burning
someone's child and you'll let him live?

813
01:02:28,949 --> 01:02:31,690
There'll be a way other than killing him
to make him pay.

814
01:02:34,889 --> 01:02:37,260
Sung Yo Han's vanishing from my mind.

815
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:41,530
I'm going back to being myself,
Jung Ba Reum.

816
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:44,070
Back then,

817
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:47,969
if someone. had killed Han Seo Joon
the same way,

818
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:50,639
what would've happened to me?

819
01:02:50,710 --> 01:02:52,110
(Suspect of butcher murder apprehended!)

820
01:02:52,239 --> 01:02:53,980
Would I be happier than I am now?

821
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:06,789
It's Mu Won's birthday.

822
01:03:10,219 --> 01:03:11,329
Ba Reum.

823
01:03:12,590 --> 01:03:13,659
Hello.

824
01:03:15,730 --> 01:03:16,960
What is it you want to say?

825
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:25,269
- Bong Yi.
- Yes?

826
01:03:26,739 --> 01:03:28,010
I'm...

827
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:31,449
a bit sick.

828
01:03:32,409 --> 01:03:34,820
Where? Is it bad?

829
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:40,789
But...

830
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:43,860
I think I can be cured.

831
01:03:45,489 --> 01:03:48,030
Today, I saw a glimmer of hope.

832
01:03:50,699 --> 01:03:52,730
So until I'm well,

833
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:55,739
can you wait?

834
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:00,170
I'll wait.

835
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:02,909
I can wait.

836
01:04:05,309 --> 01:04:08,650
It might take a very long time.

837
01:04:10,519 --> 01:04:11,789
I don't mind.

838
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:14,920
I'll wait for you
until my hair goes white.

839
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:20,090
So don't you go and dump me then
because I'm old.

840
01:04:28,369 --> 01:04:29,699
When I'm better,

841
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:31,869
shall we move to the countryside together?

842
01:04:33,010 --> 01:04:34,409
I can be a policeman there.

843
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:37,880
That sounds nice.

844
01:05:03,699 --> 01:05:06,070
Why come all the way here
when you must be busy?

845
01:05:06,469 --> 01:05:09,480
It'll be two years before I see you again.
I should say goodbye.

846
01:05:13,079 --> 01:05:15,019
Hoon Seok, did you name the cat?

847
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:17,019
Yes. Toto.

848
01:05:17,250 --> 01:05:21,460
That's what Dorothy's dog is called
in "The Wizard of Oz". Toto.

849
01:05:21,590 --> 01:05:22,659
Toto?

850
01:05:23,619 --> 01:05:25,230
That's a great name.

851
01:05:26,289 --> 01:05:28,900
Hoon Seok, if you have
any questions about raising cats,

852
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:31,800
there's "Nyang Nyang's Cafe". Say it.

853
01:05:32,030 --> 01:05:33,630
Nyang Nyang's Cafe?

854
01:05:33,699 --> 01:05:37,510
Yes. Ask Nyang Nyang's Cafe.
There's a lot of information there.

855
01:05:37,769 --> 01:05:41,309
Isn't Toto's mom sad that
she's losing a kitten?

856
01:05:45,449 --> 01:05:48,679
She knows you'll take good care of Toto.

857
01:05:48,949 --> 01:05:50,119
She'll be fine.

858
01:05:51,090 --> 01:05:53,820
We have to get on the bus.
Let's go, Hoon Seok. Take care.

859
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:03,030
Watch the steps.

860
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:09,099
- Mom, who is that man?
- What is it?

861
01:06:09,170 --> 01:06:12,110
It's nobody. Wave to Ba Reum.

862
01:06:22,619 --> 01:06:23,480
This just in.

863
01:06:23,519 --> 01:06:26,550
The child detective who had severe burns
after a cleaning solution...

864
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:28,659
was poured all over him...

865
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:31,789
at an elementary school in Mujin...

866
01:06:31,860 --> 01:06:35,329
miraculously got through the worst.

867
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:37,030
He is now in recovery.

868
01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:39,030
Meanwhile, the boy...

869
01:07:13,230 --> 01:07:14,699
Here you go.

870
01:07:39,590 --> 01:07:41,099
Are you having a party up there...

871
01:07:42,659 --> 01:07:43,929
with Mom and Dad?

872
01:07:46,429 --> 01:07:47,869
Without me?

873
01:07:48,670 --> 01:07:49,969
Let's never see each other again.

874
01:07:50,909 --> 01:07:52,769
Let's never see each other ever again.

875
01:07:52,909 --> 01:07:56,780
You jerk. I hate you more than
that scumbag, Han Seo Joon.

876
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:01,519
I'm sorry.

877
01:08:03,679 --> 01:08:05,219
I really am.

878
01:08:12,130 --> 01:08:13,559
I miss you.

879
01:08:15,659 --> 01:08:16,800
Mom.

880
01:08:19,170 --> 01:08:20,300
Dad.

881
01:08:21,970 --> 01:08:23,140
I miss you all.

882
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:36,479
Bong Yi.

883
01:08:38,390 --> 01:08:40,920
I made a reservation at a nice restaurant
for tomorrow's dinner.

884
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:43,060
Yes.

885
01:08:44,119 --> 01:08:46,930
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow. Goodbye.

886
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:02,340
What brings you here?

887
01:09:03,779 --> 01:09:04,850
Let's drink.

888
01:09:07,649 --> 01:09:08,819
Detective Go.

889
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:11,819
Is something wrong?

890
01:09:13,090 --> 01:09:14,420
Today's my brother's birthday.

891
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:20,090
I was drinking some soju...

892
01:09:21,130 --> 01:09:22,560
then realized how pitiful I looked.

893
01:09:23,529 --> 01:09:25,470
That's when I thought of you.

894
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:27,500
And here I am.

895
01:09:28,239 --> 01:09:29,340
I'm glad you came.

896
01:09:30,770 --> 01:09:35,010
I heard you treated my brother very well.

897
01:09:37,079 --> 01:09:38,409
I didn't do much.

898
01:09:38,649 --> 01:09:41,619
He cherished me a lot.

899
01:09:43,380 --> 01:09:47,520
He talked about you all the time.

900
01:09:49,590 --> 01:09:51,630
He cared about you a lot.

901
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:56,000
Do you know why I hated...

902
01:09:56,300 --> 01:09:57,729
and avoided him so much?

903
01:09:58,329 --> 01:10:01,569
That's because he wanted
to forgive Han Seo Joon.

904
01:10:01,699 --> 01:10:04,770
No. That was just an excuse.

905
01:10:06,539 --> 01:10:07,779
I couldn't take it.

906
01:10:09,210 --> 01:10:10,979
I was the reason why he got hurt.

907
01:10:12,079 --> 01:10:15,350
He was luring Han Seo Joon away
to save me.

908
01:10:17,220 --> 01:10:20,920
Seeing his disabled body drove me crazy.

909
01:10:21,060 --> 01:10:22,189
The guilt was too much to handle.

910
01:10:24,159 --> 01:10:25,689
That's why I avoided him.

911
01:10:26,359 --> 01:10:28,529
I was being selfish.
I only cared about myself.

912
01:10:32,029 --> 01:10:35,140
I'm sure he knew that it was all...

913
01:10:35,539 --> 01:10:36,899
out of guilt,

914
01:10:37,710 --> 01:10:39,310
not hatred.

915
01:10:46,710 --> 01:10:48,149
Do you want to see a photo of him
when he was little?

916
01:10:50,350 --> 01:10:52,350
Didn't he also have...

917
01:10:52,649 --> 01:10:55,590
Right. You had told me before
that he had the same one.

918
01:10:55,619 --> 01:10:59,289
Yes. He always wore it.

919
01:10:59,329 --> 01:11:00,960
My mom must've gotten two of them.

920
01:11:01,130 --> 01:11:02,930
I couldn't find his, though.

921
01:11:03,399 --> 01:11:05,329
It's a bit too small to see, but look.

922
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:06,630
That's him.

923
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:09,970
- Doesn't he look pretty?
- He does.

924
01:11:10,199 --> 01:11:12,109
He was always a nerd.

925
01:11:12,140 --> 01:11:13,909
He was really smart.

926
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:18,479
You two looked so alike...

927
01:11:18,579 --> 01:11:20,149
when you were little.

928
01:11:20,279 --> 01:11:21,619
Do you think so?

929
01:11:23,220 --> 01:11:25,090
You must share many memories.

930
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:28,619
I have no siblings.

931
01:11:29,619 --> 01:11:30,720
It's a bummer.

932
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:38,399
Hey, Officer Jung.

933
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:39,600
Yes?

934
01:11:39,729 --> 01:11:41,039
Do you want to be my brother?

935
01:11:41,939 --> 01:11:43,800
- Your brother?
- Yes.

936
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:47,170
I want to be the type of brother
Mu Won was to me.

937
01:11:48,579 --> 01:11:49,810
You have no siblings after all.

938
01:11:50,579 --> 01:11:51,680
Right.

939
01:11:56,979 --> 01:11:58,119
I'd like that.

940
01:11:58,720 --> 01:11:59,850
Brother.

941
01:12:00,619 --> 01:12:01,689
Nice.

942
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:03,359
You're Jung Ba Reum, my little brother.

943
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:04,890
Okay?

944
01:12:04,930 --> 01:12:08,300
Let's have a drink
to commemorate this day. Okay?

945
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:11,229
Let's drink up tonight. Cheers.

946
01:12:11,529 --> 01:12:13,170
- Cheers.
- Let's drink...

947
01:12:13,369 --> 01:12:15,100
to our deaths!

948
01:12:41,659 --> 01:12:42,930
Where's the bathroom?

949
01:12:44,060 --> 01:12:45,199
Bathroom...

950
01:12:53,310 --> 01:12:54,409
Darn it.

951
01:13:10,789 --> 01:13:13,789
That's strange. I can't find his necklace.

952
01:13:14,229 --> 01:13:16,130
Didn't he also have...

953
01:13:16,159 --> 01:13:19,130
He always wore it.

954
01:13:20,729 --> 01:13:22,770
Did it get mixed with other evidence?

955
01:13:36,119 --> 01:13:37,890
Did this knife always look like this?

956
01:13:44,529 --> 01:13:45,689
Isn't this blood?

957
01:14:10,050 --> 01:14:12,989
Gosh, he left something
extremely valuable.

958
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:18,590
I compared the blood with that
of Bong Yi's and Yo Han's.

959
01:14:18,689 --> 01:14:19,989
But neither was a match.

960
01:14:22,060 --> 01:14:23,260
Then whose blood is it?

961
01:14:23,699 --> 01:14:26,630
Please compare it to the database
in case there's a match.

962
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:35,380
Where is this scar from?

963
01:14:38,409 --> 01:14:40,210
Good morning.

964
01:14:40,909 --> 01:14:43,050
That's why I'd like to check the evidence.

965
01:14:46,119 --> 01:14:48,189
It's with the Evidence Storage Team?

966
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:49,989
Okay.

967
01:14:54,130 --> 01:14:55,529
- Bong Yi.
- Yes?

968
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:58,229
Can you meet with Inspector Park Du Seok
from the Evidence Storage Team?

969
01:14:58,270 --> 01:14:59,770
I'd like to check something with him
regarding the evidence found...

970
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:01,069
in the Kim Byeong Tae case.

971
01:15:01,539 --> 01:15:02,970
Sure. Got it.

972
01:15:03,239 --> 01:15:04,539
Did the result come out?

973
01:15:04,710 --> 01:15:07,409
It's strange. It's Kang Deok Soo's blood.

974
01:15:07,470 --> 01:15:09,409
What? Kang Deok Soo?

975
01:15:11,750 --> 01:15:13,680
Why would his blood be found
on that knife?

976
01:15:15,680 --> 01:15:16,779
Why would it...

977
01:15:24,159 --> 01:15:25,260
Hey, brother.

978
01:15:26,729 --> 01:15:27,789
Mu Chi.

979
01:16:15,939 --> 01:16:17,340
Ba Reum!

980
01:16:18,409 --> 01:16:19,510
Bong Yi.

981
01:16:22,279 --> 01:16:24,550
You... That...

982
01:16:25,149 --> 01:16:26,989
This? Do you remember?

983
01:16:27,020 --> 01:16:28,560
Before the accident, you gave it...

984
01:16:32,189 --> 01:16:33,329
Were you wearing this...

985
01:16:34,189 --> 01:16:36,100
on the day you met Go Nam?

986
01:16:38,470 --> 01:16:39,529
Yes.

987
01:16:39,569 --> 01:16:40,729
Only one?

988
01:16:41,670 --> 01:16:43,670
Wait. That's...

989
01:16:45,970 --> 01:16:47,710
This? Isn't it pretty?

990
01:16:47,739 --> 01:16:50,779
A guy I really like made it for me.

991
01:16:50,979 --> 01:16:52,109
A guy?

992
01:16:52,149 --> 01:16:54,310
Yes. Oh, there he is.

993
01:16:55,149 --> 01:16:56,279
Bong Yi.

994
01:16:56,449 --> 01:16:57,819
He knew...

995
01:16:59,489 --> 01:17:01,220
that this was a cat's tooth.

996
01:17:05,390 --> 01:17:07,460
Don't you think the same killer
killed this cat as well?

997
01:17:07,489 --> 01:17:09,300
- It has no teeth.
- Show this to your friends...

998
01:17:09,329 --> 01:17:11,300
and tell them to call the police
if they had witnessed anything.

999
01:17:12,229 --> 01:17:13,399
What's wrong?

1000
01:17:13,430 --> 01:17:16,100
Are you okay? Ba Reum. Ba Reum!

1001
01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:07,090
Why...

1002
01:18:08,159 --> 01:18:09,960
Why is this in my house?

1003
01:18:14,829 --> 01:18:16,359
They'll tear down all the houses there
starting tomorrow.

1004
01:18:18,029 --> 01:18:19,729
It'll be gone forever.

1005
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:29,140
No. You shouldn't. Don't.

1006
01:19:29,869 --> 01:19:31,369
Move. I said, move.

1007
01:19:56,760 --> 01:19:58,729
No. Don't open it.

1008
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:02,399
Do not open it. Please. No. Don't do it.

1009
01:21:50,609 --> 01:21:51,779
It was me.

1010
01:21:53,779 --> 01:21:55,119
It wasn't Sung Yo Han.

1011
01:21:57,319 --> 01:21:58,319
It was me.

1012
01:22:13,199 --> 01:22:17,640
(Dong Goo)

1013
01:22:21,369 --> 01:22:25,079
Ba Reum, Chi Gook woke up.
He regained his consciousness.

1014
01:22:27,250 --> 01:22:28,250
What?

1015
01:22:48,970 --> 01:22:51,399
(Mouse)

1016
01:22:51,710 --> 01:22:53,510
Chi Gook woke up. Let's go in.

1017
01:22:54,010 --> 01:22:55,239
What do you think?

1018
01:22:56,479 --> 01:22:58,609
I asked you not to make me a monster.

1019
01:23:00,050 --> 01:23:01,409
I begged.

1020
01:23:02,550 --> 01:23:05,420
But you disregarded my prayers.

1021
01:23:06,750 --> 01:23:08,920
What kind of a deity does that make you?

1022
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:11,489
Now I'm the deity.

1023
01:23:12,659 --> 01:23:15,359
Everyone who believes
the nonsense you teach.

1024
01:23:16,159 --> 01:23:17,899
I will judge them all.
