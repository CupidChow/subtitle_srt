11
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,649
You're due any day now.
Take a taxi here whenever labor starts.

12
00:00:47,649 --> 00:00:48,750
Okay.

13
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,460
Han Seo Joon was arrested a month ago,

14
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,289
and other than those of
the camping ground victims,

15
00:00:56,359 --> 00:00:59,659
police haven't found any more heads
and the investigation is slowing.

16
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,899
The man who killed at least 20 people...

17
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:06,569
and took their heads.
Han Seo Joon, the notorious Headhunter.

18
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,170
He still pleads the fifth
to remain silent,

19
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:11,280
as if to mock the police.

20
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:12,739
They've decided to no longer...

21
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:15,510
Hey. What are you doing?

22
00:01:15,579 --> 00:01:17,680
- What are you doing to the kid?
- Let go!

23
00:01:18,019 --> 00:01:20,120
- What are you doing?
- Stop it.

24
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:21,420
- Get off him.
- No.

25
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,290
- No!
- Get away from him.

26
00:01:23,489 --> 00:01:25,560
- No. No!
- Are you okay?

27
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,629
Come here.

28
00:01:34,099 --> 00:01:35,670
You got tested, right?

29
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:37,700
What will you do?

30
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,319
You can't have it.

31
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,250
You must not have the baby.

32
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,250
You must not. You can't have it.

33
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:56,890
- What are you doing? Let go!
- Don't have it.

34
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,719
You can't have the baby. You can't.

35
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:02,030
Don't have it! Don't!

36
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:04,099
She took drugs to kill them both.

37
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:07,329
What did the kid do wrong?
She should just kill herself.

38
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:17,379
When it's a fetus, it doesn't show signs.

39
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,439
Let's wait and see.

40
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:23,340
(Mouse)

41
00:03:24,509 --> 00:03:26,580
Mr. A, the suspect of the knot murders...

42
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:30,110
was attacked and killed by an acquaintance
while he was in the hospital.

43
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,250
We have no right to arraignment,

44
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,550
and the case is closed.

45
00:03:57,979 --> 00:03:59,240
What's this?

46
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:05,379
Are you all right?

47
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,150
Yes.

48
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,250
What happened to your hand?
Did you hurt it?

49
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:14,159
It got caught in a closing door.

50
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,830
Wash up, quick.

51
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,430
Did you cook?

52
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:20,970
Yes.

53
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,100
We could eat out.

54
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,439
It's fine.

55
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:27,470
Thanks a lot.

56
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:29,740
There's not much.

57
00:04:33,949 --> 00:04:35,079
It's good.

58
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:38,019
Hey, about yesterday.

59
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,649
Did we fight?

60
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:44,120
I remember walking up to this place,
but not after that.

61
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:49,160
You grabbed me by the collar
as soon as you saw me,

62
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,660
and threw a punch.

63
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,129
I had to control you. Sorry.

64
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,629
No, no. I should apologize instead.

65
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,839
I should quit drinking.

66
00:04:59,339 --> 00:05:01,839
Yes, you should. It could kill you.

67
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:05,379
I won't die.

68
00:05:05,709 --> 00:05:07,379
Not until I cut his throat.

69
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:12,750
I get how you feel,
but Han Seo Joon was sentenced to death.

70
00:05:12,819 --> 00:05:16,720
So what if he was? He's still alive.
He eats and sleeps just fine.

71
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:19,790
If the government won't kill him,
I should. Who else will do it?

72
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,360
My life blows. Why am I so unlucky?

73
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:29,930
I followed a guy for a year and
he jumped to his death in my presence.

74
00:05:30,069 --> 00:05:32,540
Then I shot a guy and
only got suspended for a year.

75
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,870
Then someone else got to a guy
who deserved to die.

76
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:36,939
Why is nothing working out?

77
00:05:37,009 --> 00:05:40,509
You're not unlucky.
Father Go is protecting you.

78
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:46,949
Memories of before my accident
are coming back.

79
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:49,720
The Father Go I remember...

80
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,120
always worried about you.

81
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:56,860
He was always upset and he felt for you.

82
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:05,740
Keep your hand dry or it'll get infected.

83
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,699
- Bong Yi.
- How is your hand? Is it okay?

84
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:36,399
Yes, it's fine.

85
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,759
No, don't kill him. You can't kill him.

86
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,160
Hit him. Hit him! Kill him!

87
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:03,290
Kill him. Hit him. Hit him!

88
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,129
- Kill him.
- No! No!

89
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,519
- Ba Reum.
- Bong Yi.

90
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,689
What happened to your hand?

91
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:32,920
Oh, this? My hand...

92
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:35,430
It got caught between a door.

93
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:39,199
Detective Go had
too much to drink, so I... I...

94
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:42,529
I was trying to help him and he fell.

95
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,740
You idiot! You should've
gone to a hospital first.

96
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:47,470
Let's see a doctor.

97
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:49,110
Remember what the doctor said.

98
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:51,639
Be careful until the bones set.

99
00:07:51,709 --> 00:07:52,879
I will.

100
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:00,519
A bad brain has been placed
in this mouse's head.

101
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,589
If you let it live,
it might bite you to death too.

102
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:05,360
A bad brain...

103
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:09,459
bites to death?

104
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:20,439
So, why is it still so quiet?

105
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,040
I thought that by now,
the world would be turned upside-down.

106
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,250
The world's first
successful brain transplant.

107
00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:30,550
In Jung Ba Reum's head...

108
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,889
is the brain of a serial killer.

109
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:41,330
Have you decided to keep your mouth shut?

110
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:46,159
I'm disappointed.

111
00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:50,639
I thought I'd gain
the world's attention like Daniel.

112
00:08:52,539 --> 00:08:53,909
I think...

113
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,070
there's a problem.

114
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:04,679
I almost killed someone.

115
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,250
What on earth...

116
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:11,860
is happening to me?

117
00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:14,990
Tell me.

118
00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:40,820
Into the head of a docile mouse,

119
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:44,490
I've implanted the frontal lobe
of an aggressive mouse in it.

120
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,830
Then the docile mouse...

121
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,669
gradually turned aggressive.

122
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,870
Then in the end...

123
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,049
Are you afraid...

124
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,580
that it'll happen to you as well?

125
00:10:12,549 --> 00:10:14,090
I'm also curious.

126
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:17,860
You're the first human experiment
I've ever performed.

127
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:22,230
But then again, I didn't replace
your entire frontal lobe.

128
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:25,230
I only replaced the damaged parts.

129
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,029
However, I do hope that Yo Han's nature...

130
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:33,470
won't overpower yours.

131
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:35,110
I mean it.

132
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:49,590
Detective Go, I'm sorry.

133
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:50,990
I must've been...

134
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:53,889
How did it go?

135
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,529
She is Jeong Man Ho's daughter.

136
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:56,789
It's not Hyeon Soo.

137
00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:01,100
Then...

138
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:03,370
Then where's my daughter? Where?

139
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:09,509
Sir.

140
00:11:11,139 --> 00:11:12,179
Sir.

141
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:13,909
Sir!

142
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,679
I've been getting
several visitations today.

143
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,480
I like protective custody.

144
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,990
They allow two visitations in one day.

145
00:11:23,389 --> 00:11:24,590
Why didn't you tell me?

146
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:27,690
Why didn't you tell me that
those remains weren't Hyeon Soo's?

147
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,860
I never confirmed that they were.

148
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:31,029
Where is she?

149
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:34,029
Where did you bury my daughter? No.

150
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,899
Where did you dispose of her?

151
00:11:38,169 --> 00:11:39,269
I'm not sure.

152
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:44,809
It happened years ago,
so I'm drawing a blank.

153
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,450
You can't remember? Seriously?

154
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:50,850
My wife is still living in the memories
from 25 years ago...

155
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,620
when you had kidnapped our children!

156
00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:56,019
So how dare you tell me
that you can't remember?

157
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,389
Before blaming me,

158
00:11:58,889 --> 00:12:01,460
you should've been more careful
with your words.

159
00:12:01,529 --> 00:12:02,590
You...

160
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:06,899
You're right. I'm sorry. No.

161
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,230
I'm sorry, sir. I've made a mistake.

162
00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:12,870
If you want me to rip out my tongue,
I'll do that.

163
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,340
Just please let me give my daughter...

164
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:18,509
a proper burial. Please.

165
00:12:19,909 --> 00:12:22,850
Darn it. I said I don't remember,

166
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:25,220
- so don't pester me.
- You dirtbag!

167
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:27,049
I'm going to kill you!

168
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,350
You... How dare you call yourself human?

169
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:31,120
Bring me back my daughter! Where is she?

170
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:33,889
Let me go! I said, let go! Hey!

171
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:36,389
Let me go! Let go! I'm going to kill him!

172
00:12:36,429 --> 00:12:39,299
Let me go! Let go!

173
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,830
- You scumbag!
- You'll regret...

174
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,370
shooting Yo Han.

175
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,840
You're right.

176
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:48,210
I'm already regretting it.

177
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:51,009
Had I known he was your son,

178
00:12:51,409 --> 00:12:54,080
I would've killed him after killing you.

179
00:12:54,379 --> 00:12:56,509
I am terribly and awfully...

180
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,080
regretting it.

181
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:04,190
I see no signs of immunorejection.

182
00:13:04,419 --> 00:13:05,789
Your brain seems to be doing fine.

183
00:13:06,789 --> 00:13:09,159
- Is there a problem?
- Well...

184
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,059
His memories keep popping up
in my head as if they're mine.

185
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,029
And I've become more aggressive.

186
00:13:17,539 --> 00:13:20,970
What if I end up turning into him?

187
00:13:23,409 --> 00:13:24,539
This is why...

188
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:29,409
I didn't want to tell you
who the donor was.

189
00:13:30,149 --> 00:13:31,549
Those symptoms started manifesting...

190
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:35,049
after you learned that you had received
his brain, right?

191
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,860
Yes.

192
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:41,490
- But...
- Oftentimes, patients believe...

193
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:45,100
their donors' personality and nature
have been implanted in them as well.

194
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:47,600
Moreover, in your case,
you've been given...

195
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,700
brain transplantation,
so it's more understandable.

196
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:54,340
I'll prescribe you some medication,
so make sure you take them.

197
00:13:55,309 --> 00:13:57,710
(Pyeongan Substation)

198
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:01,210
Here comes our country's very first
freelance police officer.

199
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:04,580
I understand that the chief told you
to take it slow, but isn't this too much?

200
00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:06,419
- Let me.
- Forget it.

201
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,190
Go plant those.

202
00:14:08,289 --> 00:14:10,549
We need a photo of our substation for PR.

203
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:12,490
The chief wants us to plant those
since the flower garden is too empty.

204
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:13,490
Yes, sir.

205
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,059
Right. Take that
to the Evidence Storage Team first.

206
00:14:17,259 --> 00:14:19,299
A piece of evidence
from Kang Min Joo's case was left behind.

207
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:21,000
- Really? Okay, then.
- Yes.

208
00:14:25,299 --> 00:14:26,840
- I'll be back.
- Bye.

209
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:32,940
Detective Go.

210
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:36,879
Inspector Park?

211
00:14:48,789 --> 00:14:50,690
This is evidence from Kang Min Joo's case.

212
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,779
(Sung Yo Han, murder)

213
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,679
(Sung Yo Han, murder)

214
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:24,159
It's merely psychological.

215
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:26,960
I'll be fine.

216
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:37,039
What are you doing?

217
00:15:42,549 --> 00:15:46,250
A piece of evidence
from Kang Min Joo's case was left behind.

218
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,389
So what were you doing on my computer?

219
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,620
I was looking
for Bong Yi's grandmother's brooch.

220
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:55,690
She had been wearing it
on the day of the incident,

221
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:57,259
but the police hadn't given it back.

222
00:15:58,059 --> 00:16:01,330
Bong Yi really wants it back.

223
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:06,899
I searched the evidence box,
but it wasn't in there.

224
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,240
So I decided to check the evidence list
on the computer.

225
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:13,940
- Her brooch?
- Yes.

226
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,149
I'll look for it.

227
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,980
Okay. I'll get going, then.

228
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,720
Please call me when you find it.

229
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,230
(Sung Yo Han, murder)

230
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,159
I see no brooch.

231
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,269
Here you go.

232
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,110
A, a former detective
and the suspect of the knot murders,

233
00:16:44,139 --> 00:16:46,309
worked at his friend's moving company
after his retirement...

234
00:16:46,379 --> 00:16:47,850
and had been raising
his son singlehandedly.

235
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:50,549
He was a well-spoken man.

236
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:54,850
What a crazy wench.

237
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,919
Why would you come back here
and trouble me?

238
00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:02,429
Can you please leave this neighborhood?

239
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,329
If you feel that uncomfortable,
you should move.

240
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,059
Do you think having a son like him
is something to brag about?

241
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:08,069
What did you say?

242
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:09,769
Get out of here this instant!

243
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:12,000
Let me go!

244
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,309
- Mr. Go.
- How dare you?

245
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,170
Sung Yo Han has been on my mind
these days.

246
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,109
"An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth."

247
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:22,650
Mistreat her like that again,
and I won't go easy on you.

248
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,349
Where are taking me?

249
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:46,000
Why did you lie to me?

250
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,269
You hurt my feelings.

251
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:49,140
Mom.

252
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,579
That wench...

253
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,750
grew up beautifully.

254
00:18:03,019 --> 00:18:04,119
Let go!

255
00:18:05,589 --> 00:18:06,789
Why are you here?

256
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:10,430
I heard you asked Officer Jung
to find your grandmother's brooch.

257
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:13,160
I went to the hospital to tell you.
Who said you could leave so soon?

258
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,230
Would it have been that terrible
to get a vitamin IV...

259
00:18:14,299 --> 00:18:15,529
and rest for a few days?

260
00:18:15,569 --> 00:18:17,670
Do you think I have the money to do that?

261
00:18:18,869 --> 00:18:21,170
So? Did you find her brooch?

262
00:18:21,509 --> 00:18:22,509
No.

263
00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:25,880
Seeing how it's not on the evidence list
either, she must've dropped it elsewhere.

264
00:18:27,309 --> 00:18:28,450
Really?

265
00:18:35,049 --> 00:18:36,390
What are you doing?

266
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,720
Don't you know Kang Deok Soo
has been released?

267
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:40,420
You shouldn't have come back here.

268
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,589
Of course, I know he was released.
Everyone does.

269
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,190
He lives only a few meters away.

270
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,930
He doesn't live here anymore.

271
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,200
But his mother does.

272
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:50,230
- He could come back anytime.
- So?

273
00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:52,069
Does that mean I should run away?

274
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,400
Where to this time?

275
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,910
Should I live on the streets?

276
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:00,680
Do you think I wanted
to come back to this neighborhood?

277
00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:02,710
My grandma and I fled
in the middle of the night...

278
00:19:02,779 --> 00:19:04,950
and lived in a vacant house
in a redevelopment area.

279
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:08,720
This is the only house that I can live in.

280
00:19:08,849 --> 00:19:10,619
My dad had built this house.

281
00:19:11,019 --> 00:19:12,890
Then stay at my house for now.

282
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:16,289
- Just bring the bare necessities.
- No. Why should I go there?

283
00:19:16,329 --> 00:19:18,599
Who are you? My dad?

284
00:19:21,329 --> 00:19:22,869
Right. I'm not...

285
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:24,869
your dad.

286
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,140
Are you even eating properly?

287
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,680
You're not eating ramyeon every day,
are you?

288
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:36,680
I'm eating well,

289
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,220
so you should eat properly as well.

290
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:47,619
I'm off, you brat.

291
00:19:50,259 --> 00:19:51,960
Wait. About Woo Jae Pil...

292
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:55,970
- Yes?
- Did he work at a moving company?

293
00:19:56,099 --> 00:19:57,400
I heard it on the news.

294
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:00,670
That's right. I heard that he worked
in a team at a moving company.

295
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:02,740
- Why?
- For a person...

296
00:20:02,809 --> 00:20:04,210
who was working as a mover,

297
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,579
he had hands that had been
well taken care of.

298
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:10,509
I mean, his hands were very soft.

299
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,150
I don't think he had been doing
manual labor.

300
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:15,750
Oh, one more thing.
When he covered my mouth,

301
00:20:15,819 --> 00:20:19,160
I felt something cold like metal.

302
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:21,490
- Metal?
- A ring?

303
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:23,960
Well... I'm not sure.

304
00:20:24,029 --> 00:20:26,630
Bong Yi said that his hands were soft.

305
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,500
But Woo Jae Pil had been working as
a mover since he quit being a detective.

306
00:20:30,569 --> 00:20:32,000
There's no way his hands were soft.

307
00:20:32,069 --> 00:20:34,609
I'm sorry, but can we talk about this
later? I should finish this within today.

308
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:36,440
You saw him up close.

309
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:39,509
You treated him so nicely
calling him a national hero,

310
00:20:39,579 --> 00:20:41,480
- and now you're making him do this?
- It's not like that.

311
00:20:41,549 --> 00:20:43,079
Do you want me to call reporters
so they can take photos of him?

312
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:45,819
Come on, Detective Go.
You're putting me in a difficult position.

313
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:48,250
I already have to tiptoe
around Officer Nam.

314
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:50,250
Did Officer Nam made you do this,
not the head of the substation?

315
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:53,220
- He should've been more considerate.
- Please don't.

316
00:20:53,289 --> 00:20:55,529
Please stop it. I said I was fine.
What's wrong with you?

317
00:20:55,789 --> 00:20:58,460
I'll do it for you. Sit there to rest.
I'll finish it quickly.

318
00:20:58,529 --> 00:20:59,799
I can finish it very quickly.

319
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:01,130
I just have to plant the flowers
here, right?

320
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,170
Why would they suddenly need flowers
in front of the building?

321
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,869
I hate it most when they do
things like this just for show.

322
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,210
Detective Go, do you have the photos?

323
00:21:14,509 --> 00:21:15,880
The photos of the scene...

324
00:21:16,049 --> 00:21:18,450
when Park Hyeon Soo, no, I mean,
Jeong Soo Jin's remains were found.

325
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:23,150
Woo Jae Pil confessed that he dug
a hole and buried her body...

326
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,259
all by himself, right?

327
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:28,329
Now look. Since I'm right-handed,

328
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:31,630
I hold the handle with my right hand and
support the lower part with my left hand.

329
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,099
Like this.

330
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:36,829
Then when the shovel touches the ground,
the left corner will have the most force.

331
00:21:37,099 --> 00:21:39,700
So the left side would be dug deeper
than the right side.

332
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:41,140
Look at the photo.

333
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:43,710
The direction should be the opposite
if he was left-handed.

334
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:45,809
But the direction is the same
as the hole I dug.

335
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,779
You're right. It should be
the opposite direction...

336
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:50,210
because Woo Jae Pil was left-handed
while you're right-handed.

337
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:52,450
Woo Jae Pil was left-handed for sure.

338
00:21:55,349 --> 00:21:57,319
Does that mean someone else dug the hole?

339
00:22:01,829 --> 00:22:04,289
I got it. The reason why it was dug
in the same direction as I did.

340
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,859
The cast.

341
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:10,000
He had to use his right hand because
he was wearing a cast on his left arm.

342
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:12,740
He must not have been able to tie the knot
with one hand though.

343
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:16,569
That means another left-handed person
tied the knot on Jeong Soo Jin's wrists.

344
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:19,779
Do you remember the knot
on Jeong Soo Jin's body?

345
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:23,109
- As if a young kid had tied this...
- He said it looked unskilled.

346
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:24,779
A young kid... A young kid...

347
00:22:27,819 --> 00:22:29,990
How old was Woo Hyeong Cheol at the time?

348
00:22:30,819 --> 00:22:33,619
He was 12 years old in 5th grade.

349
00:22:35,029 --> 00:22:37,529
But Woo Hyeong Cheol has...

350
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,759
a solid alibi at the presumed time
of Hong Na Ri's death.

351
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,700
We should figure that out.

352
00:22:43,069 --> 00:22:45,539
A the presumed time
of Hong Na Ri's death,

353
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:47,940
Woo Hyeong Cheol was installing
a window guard at that house.

354
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,779
Did you stay at home
while he was installing it?

355
00:22:57,349 --> 00:22:59,579
Of course. Hey, quiet down.

356
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:03,720
Oh, right. I stepped out briefly
to take my puppy to the vet.

357
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,990
Was Mr. Woo still here when you came back?

358
00:23:07,259 --> 00:23:08,960
He was wrapping it up.

359
00:23:10,059 --> 00:23:11,359
How long were you out?

360
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:13,829
Well... For about 20 minutes.

361
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:16,670
There's a vet right on the main street.

362
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:18,339
20 minutes.

363
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:19,900
What was the problem?

364
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,970
My puppy had a seizure.

365
00:23:22,269 --> 00:23:24,069
The vet said it was a hypoglycemic shock.

366
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,910
He asked me if I gave it
some food with xylitol.

367
00:23:27,009 --> 00:23:28,549
I gave it nothing but the dog food.

368
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:31,079
Maybe it ate something on the ground
while taking a walk.

369
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:40,259
I'm sure he gave the dog something.

370
00:23:41,089 --> 00:23:42,829
To make up an alibi.

371
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,930
Okay. It takes eight minutes by car...

372
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,029
from that villa to Hong Na Ri's house.
16 minutes to travel back and forth.

373
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,400
- Done? Okay. Next, the neck.
- Yes.

374
00:23:55,539 --> 00:23:57,069
- Here we go.
- Right.

375
00:23:57,309 --> 00:23:58,839
He's strangling her.

376
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:06,519
Too hard.

377
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:09,819
Hey, it's too hard.

378
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:13,589
Harder. Strangle him harder.

379
00:24:17,259 --> 00:24:18,660
Harder.

380
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:23,000
It must feel so good.

381
00:24:32,309 --> 00:24:33,980
Gosh, you crazy punk. Gosh.

382
00:24:34,309 --> 00:24:35,579
Have you lost your mind?

383
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,079
You could've just pretended.
Why did you actually strangle me?

384
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:42,950
- Hurry up and untie me.
- Okay.

385
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,450
Hurry.

386
00:24:46,859 --> 00:24:48,230
20 minutes have already passed.

387
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:51,730
I don't think it's impossible
to come here to kill her,

388
00:24:52,259 --> 00:24:53,660
and go back to that villa.

389
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:57,029
Are you okay?

390
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,039
Right. Are you all right, Detective Go?

391
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,940
- I almost died, you punk.
- I... I'm sorry.

392
00:25:04,809 --> 00:25:05,740
I'm so dizzy.

393
00:25:05,809 --> 00:25:08,779
16 minutes to go from that villa
to Hong Na Ri's house and back.

394
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:12,150
5 to 10 minutes to tie her up
and kill her.

395
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,380
It must've taken at least 20 minutes.

396
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,289
But Hong Na Ri must've fought back,
so it must have taken...

397
00:25:16,349 --> 00:25:18,390
more than 20 minutes to take her down
and clean up the scene.

398
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,359
20 minutes are not long enough.

399
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:28,630
You don't look well.

400
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:30,630
Eat up and go home to rest.

401
00:25:31,869 --> 00:25:32,869
Okay.

402
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:35,940
I must say, you've changed a lot.
You keep surprising me.

403
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:38,380
- What do you mean by that?
- Honestly,

404
00:25:38,779 --> 00:25:40,880
before your head injury,

405
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:44,779
you didn't seem to be
cut out for this job.

406
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,980
Or something like that. But now...

407
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:49,619
you act as if you can see...

408
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:51,349
deep inside a murder's mind.

409
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:54,059
It's hard to believe that you've
changed this way.

410
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:56,390
Maybe I should give a brain surgery a go.

411
00:25:57,329 --> 00:25:58,700
I haven't changed at all.

412
00:25:59,859 --> 00:26:01,000
Gosh, that was too hot.

413
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:03,130
Hey, that was a compliment.

414
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,200
You're being so sensitive.

415
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,309
I'm sorry, Detective Go.

416
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:10,769
I burned the roof of my mouth
because of you.

417
00:26:11,009 --> 00:26:12,779
- Go and get me a can of beer.
- Of course.

418
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,180
Gosh, that punk.

419
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,390
Here you go.

420
00:26:28,289 --> 00:26:30,359
Excuse me. Why isn't this beer cold?

421
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,599
I took beer cans out of the fridge...

422
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:35,700
to put in a large pot with ox bone soup
to cool down the soup.

423
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:37,970
- I just put them back in the fridge.
- What's this?

424
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:40,039
It's cool enough. Don't be so picky.

425
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,470
"Picky"?

426
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:44,109
Beer tastes good only when it's cold.

427
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:46,180
I'm not drinking this!
Put it back in there.

428
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:52,579
What a jerk.

429
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:53,950
What... What did you just say?

430
00:26:54,849 --> 00:26:57,950
Me? I... I didn't say anything.

431
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,490
I heard you complaining.

432
00:27:10,299 --> 00:27:11,329
Detective Go.

433
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:14,599
Detective Go, I figured it out.
The mystery of Woo Hyeong Cheol's alibi...

434
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:16,170
on the day of Hong Na Ri's death.

435
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:18,980
Have a good time.

436
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,309
It's cold. Go on in now.

437
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:28,890
Oh, my. Hello.

438
00:27:29,589 --> 00:27:30,690
Hello.

439
00:27:30,819 --> 00:27:32,460
Did you send off your father well?

440
00:27:33,019 --> 00:27:34,690
Well, yes. Thanks for your concern.

441
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:36,230
By the way, what brings you here?

442
00:27:36,759 --> 00:27:38,400
- Your hands are so soft.
- Pardon?

443
00:27:40,029 --> 00:27:43,230
You must be relieved that your father took
all the blame for your sins and died.

444
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:45,470
What are you talking about?

445
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:47,599
Your father was so naive...

446
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:50,269
to think that you would
come to your senses...

447
00:27:50,339 --> 00:27:52,109
if he died instead of you.

448
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,509
- Excuse me.
- But I'm sorry to disappoint you.

449
00:27:53,579 --> 00:27:55,450
I know your kind of people really well.

450
00:27:55,509 --> 00:27:58,150
Your kind of people can never stop
killing other people.

451
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:00,079
You can't control it with your will.

452
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:01,819
It's an addiction.

453
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:04,390
You psychopath.

454
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:09,160
Then you should break my alibi
at the time when the girl died.

455
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,490
Before more people will be killed
just as you said.

456
00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:13,559
You see, a few days ago,

457
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,170
I pooped blood.

458
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,940
Because I drank rotten milk.

459
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:22,109
That milk was in the fridge
and it hadn't expired.

460
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:23,509
Why had it gone bad?

461
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:27,309
And I drank that milk
at Hong Na Ri's house.

462
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:34,049
Yesterday, I bought a can of beer
at a store.

463
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:36,289
But the beer was lukewarm.

464
00:28:36,349 --> 00:28:39,559
I complained about it to the store owner.

465
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,759
She said she had taken out the beer
for a while...

466
00:28:41,829 --> 00:28:44,190
to put a large pot with ox bone soup in it
in the fridge.

467
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:48,329
And the smart Officer Jung here
figured it out when he saw that pot.

468
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:51,329
What shouldn't be in the fridge.

469
00:28:52,869 --> 00:28:55,670
It wasn't the day
when you killed Hong Na Ri.

470
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:22,670
You set the temperature
in the fridge to 1°C.

471
00:29:22,869 --> 00:29:25,240
And the temperature in the room was 27°C
because the windows were closed.

472
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,640
The body would've started deposing
the next day in that temperature.

473
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:32,109
But it didn't because you kept her body
in the fridge.

474
00:29:32,779 --> 00:29:34,240
In order to prove your alibi,

475
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:37,809
you chose the applicants who lived
nearest to Hong Na Ri's house.

476
00:29:38,049 --> 00:29:41,420
And you found out that she had a puppy
from her application.

477
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:44,150
You prepared something poisonous
to give the dog.

478
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,220
Mr. Woo, I have to go out!

479
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,720
Okay.

480
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:49,829
The tenant left with her dog as planned,

481
00:29:49,859 --> 00:29:51,490
and you went to Hong Na Ri's.

482
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:02,210
You took her body out of the fridge...

483
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,369
and contacted her separated husband,
asking him to come over.

484
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:05,740
Can you come over right now?

485
00:30:05,779 --> 00:30:07,839
Why? Because you needed an alibi.

486
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:11,279
You needed someone to find the body
before it started to decompose.

487
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:15,190
Then you rushed back
and put up the window guards.

488
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:18,960
Mr. Woo, I'm sorry.
My dog suddenly got sick.

489
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:21,619
- Is it okay?
- The day your alibi stuck,

490
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:25,259
you took Hong's body out of the fridge,
so you just needed five minutes.

491
00:30:25,529 --> 00:30:27,500
Three days before her body was found.

492
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:30,630
From 4pm to 6pm on the 5th,
your schedule was empty.

493
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:33,640
You left work at 4pm claiming
you were sick and would go home.

494
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:35,670
Your office is
a 30-minute drive from home.

495
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:37,339
Hong Na Ri's home is right in the middle.

496
00:30:37,369 --> 00:30:40,279
Security cameras caught your car
pulling in an hour later.

497
00:30:40,509 --> 00:30:41,950
That's 30 minutes unaccounted for.

498
00:30:42,109 --> 00:30:44,509
The exact 30 minutes
that it took you to...

499
00:30:44,549 --> 00:30:45,980
kill Hong Na Ri and hide her body.

500
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:52,059
Are you the Grimm brothers or something?

501
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:54,319
Why don't you write novels?

502
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:56,190
That seems to suit you much better.

503
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:57,460
Shall we, Officer Jung?

504
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:00,000
I prefer documentaries more than novels.

505
00:31:00,029 --> 00:31:01,160
So do I.

506
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,500
Shall we show him this?

507
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:06,069
The DNA found inside the fridge...

508
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:10,170
It's a 99-percent match to Hong Na Ri's.
See this?

509
00:31:10,769 --> 00:31:12,279
Do you have an arrest warrant?

510
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:16,380
Bring one first.

511
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,579
No thanks to you, I'm late for work.

512
00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:19,819
Excuse me.

513
00:31:19,849 --> 00:31:21,079
What's taking them so long?

514
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:22,720
Call and ask where the warrant is.

515
00:31:25,089 --> 00:31:26,990
I don't need a warrant, you punk.

516
00:31:30,259 --> 00:31:31,390
Are you looking for this?

517
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:33,400
Hey. When...

518
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,470
- I took them while you slept in the car.
- Give them back.

519
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:37,400
- Give them to me now.
- No!

520
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:38,569
- Give them back.
- Not these!

521
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:40,000
- Give them to me!
- No.

522
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:41,200
- I can't.
- Darn you.

523
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,440
Stop!

524
00:31:43,069 --> 00:31:44,170
- Hey!
- Detective!

525
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:52,680
We'll take you in as
the suspect of Kim Young Hee,

526
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,119
Kang Min Joo, and Hong Na Ri's murders.

527
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:57,650
- What you say can be used against you.
- How did you know to come here?

528
00:31:57,789 --> 00:31:59,089
How do you think?

529
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:01,160
You said you'd applied for
an arrest warrant but hadn't,

530
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,759
so I asked Detective Shin to get one.

531
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,660
You punk. Officer Jung!

532
00:32:07,529 --> 00:32:08,559
Detective.

533
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:10,930
This time again,

534
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:12,569
Father Go protected you.

535
00:32:18,009 --> 00:32:19,079
Another surgery?

536
00:32:19,109 --> 00:32:20,579
Yes, I want another surgery.

537
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,380
The pills aren't working.

538
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:23,549
That's impossible.

539
00:32:23,579 --> 00:32:26,720
Sung Yo Han happened to die just then,

540
00:32:26,849 --> 00:32:29,190
so we got his brain out
before the cranial nerves died.

541
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,720
There's no brain to transplant now.

542
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,420
There must be a way.

543
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:33,960
Find it, please.

544
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:36,789
I even hear voices now.

545
00:32:36,859 --> 00:32:38,430
I'm afraid something might happen.

546
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,529
I'm scared to death.

547
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:43,769
Even if we find a donor's brain,
you can't have another operation.

548
00:32:44,069 --> 00:32:46,700
If word of this were to get out,

549
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,369
all of us have too much to lose.

550
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,170
It's too dangerous.

551
00:32:52,309 --> 00:32:53,339
"All of us"?

552
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:55,240
Hey.

553
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:57,549
Do you think what you stand to lose
equals what I might?

554
00:32:57,779 --> 00:32:59,579
I could lose my whole self.

555
00:32:59,619 --> 00:33:02,549
That murderer Sung Yo Han could take over!

556
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,259
If something happens to me,
it's all on you people.

557
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,630
You'd better be prepared to
take responsibility.

558
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:30,380
A new suspect in the knot murders...

559
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:32,980
is currently being investigated
by the police.

560
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:36,750
The new suspect is the son of
the dead suspect A.

561
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:39,220
How the investigation will go...

562
00:33:39,259 --> 00:33:40,789
- is talk of the town.
- I understand, doctor.

563
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:45,230
Police applied for an arrest warrant
for the new suspect,

564
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:47,630
and decided to reopen the case of...

565
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,069
the knot serial murders.

566
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,240
It's Choi Young Shin.

567
00:33:56,069 --> 00:33:57,910
I need to ask for a favor.

568
00:33:58,779 --> 00:33:59,940
(General Store)

569
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,059
Hey, you. You're still a kid and...

570
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:19,599
you're getting too fat.

571
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:21,260
What's this?

572
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,469
Can you let me off just this once?

573
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:32,179
Take this and enjoy it.

574
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:39,679
Her mom's an alcoholic.

575
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:42,119
She's been drinking every day
since her divorce.

576
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:46,489
Does the kid live nearby?

577
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:49,030
Yes. She doesn't even go to school.

578
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:51,130
She stays close to her mom.

579
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,760
Since that monster got out of prison,

580
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,469
everyone with kids moved away long ago.

581
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:59,340
Her mom doesn't seem to know
he's here yet.

582
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:02,710
- Who's here?
- You didn't know?

583
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:05,210
My gosh. You didn't know.

584
00:35:05,539 --> 00:35:06,940
Kang Deok Soo's here.

585
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:09,610
Why didn't the police call?

586
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:12,519
Shouldn't they have told you
before anyone else?

587
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:15,719
I have to go.

588
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:19,960
(General Store)

589
00:35:21,059 --> 00:35:22,389
Hey, kid!

590
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,969
I won't take it from you.

591
00:35:31,269 --> 00:35:32,239
Here.

592
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,469
Eat it with this.

593
00:35:34,969 --> 00:35:36,309
You could get sick if you just eat bread.

594
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:45,349
What's your name?

595
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:46,750
Yu Na.

596
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,449
Yu Na. I'll walk you home.

597
00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:50,690
Let's go.

598
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:02,900
Yu Na.

599
00:36:05,699 --> 00:36:06,739
Yu Na.

600
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:10,969
Take this and eat it in your room.

601
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:12,239
Go on inside.

602
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:22,889
You should move.

603
00:36:23,449 --> 00:36:24,650
As soon as possible.

604
00:36:25,989 --> 00:36:27,019
Move?

605
00:36:27,289 --> 00:36:30,730
What are you to come here
and nag and talk rubbish?

606
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:32,929
Kang Deok Soo's back.

607
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:34,800
So what?

608
00:36:35,769 --> 00:36:37,929
I'll deal with my kid.

609
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:42,199
You can move if you want.

610
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:43,309
You're...

611
00:36:45,139 --> 00:36:46,340
You're her mom.

612
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:48,980
Aren't you worried about her?

613
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:53,250
I said I can take care of my kid.

614
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,550
How dare you lecture me, kid?

615
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,789
Who are you to tell me to move?

616
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:01,659
Why are you so nosy?

617
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:06,230
What if I was his victim?

618
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:10,329
Does that give me the right to be nosy?

619
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:14,639
You're Yu Na's guardian.

620
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:17,769
Protect her.

621
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:20,079
Don't just drink.

622
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:39,630
Ba Reum?

623
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:48,670
Ba Reum.

624
00:37:57,110 --> 00:38:00,449
Bong Yi. Will I be okay?

625
00:38:02,019 --> 00:38:05,320
I'll be okay, won't I?

626
00:38:11,929 --> 00:38:12,960
Of course.

627
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:15,670
You're okay.

628
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:18,469
Nothing will happen.

629
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:29,449
Why? What's the problem?

630
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,780
- Be quiet.
- Why was it rejected?

631
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:32,949
Be quiet, fool.

632
00:38:33,349 --> 00:38:34,480
It's lack of evidence.

633
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:38,019
What more do you need when we found
Hong Na Ri's DNA all over the fridge?

634
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:39,820
So what? It's what they say.

635
00:38:39,989 --> 00:38:41,889
They told us to bring solid evidence.

636
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,690
It is that dirtbag!

637
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:46,800
Darn it!

638
00:38:48,829 --> 00:38:51,829
The arrest warrant for A, the new suspect,

639
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:52,969
has been turned down.

640
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:55,739
The public is criticizing the police...

641
00:38:55,809 --> 00:38:57,369
for their rash coercive investigation.

642
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:10,150
Let's stop sulking
and find solid evidence.

643
00:39:13,289 --> 00:39:15,929
- What is that?
- A notebook from Kim Young Hee's mother.

644
00:39:15,989 --> 00:39:17,159
There's not much in it, though.

645
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:22,800
(I threw up after
drinking too much water.)

646
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:30,940
I've seen this woman
next to Kim Young Hee.

647
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,239
Where did I see her?

648
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,250
I can take this, right?

649
00:39:48,789 --> 00:39:49,889
Do you have something to say to me?

650
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:53,559
No.

651
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:57,929
I know you. What is it?

652
00:40:01,369 --> 00:40:02,570
It's nothing much.

653
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:07,510
Could you take someone in
for about a month?

654
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,880
- Who is it?
- It's someone I know.

655
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:12,550
Don't ask any more questions.

656
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,889
- No.
- If a month is too much,

657
00:40:15,949 --> 00:40:17,250
- then a week?
- I said, no.

658
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,130
Who could it be?

659
00:40:29,869 --> 00:40:31,769
He's not the type to ask for such favors.

660
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:39,409
My gosh.

661
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:13,239
(Ba Reum)

662
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:20,480
The person you have reached is not
available. Please leave a message.

663
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,139
Thank you.

664
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:43,730
Mr. Go, are you okay? Aren't you too quiet
for someone so well-built?

665
00:42:43,929 --> 00:42:45,599
I'm sorry. What should I do?

666
00:42:48,639 --> 00:42:49,969
Be gentle.

667
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:52,840
Woo Hyeong Cheol was let go.

668
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:54,340
Don't stay out too late.

669
00:42:54,409 --> 00:42:57,309
He wasn't that strong to begin with.

670
00:42:57,679 --> 00:42:58,710
Did you see what I was capable of doing?

671
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:01,579
You only trained yourself to fight
and didn't care about studying, did you?

672
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:08,260
Here.

673
00:43:08,889 --> 00:43:09,989
What is this?

674
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:17,630
Why is this woman, Sung Ji Eun,
wiring you so much money every month?

675
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:19,070
Are you a gigolo?

676
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,400
No. You don't have the looks to be one.

677
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:24,539
What's so wrong with my face?

678
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:28,079
You'll be able to get yourself
a one-bedroom studio with that money.

679
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,210
It'd be best if you moved
into my neighborhood.

680
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:32,010
I could help you look for a place.

681
00:43:33,349 --> 00:43:34,380
No, thanks.

682
00:43:34,849 --> 00:43:36,519
Why would I accept this from you?

683
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:38,750
Just take it. I'm lending it to you.

684
00:43:38,889 --> 00:43:40,690
- It's not my money anyway.
- Look.

685
00:43:41,659 --> 00:43:44,159
Running away won't solve anything.

686
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:46,659
I'm going to stay here and fight back.

687
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,469
Even if we run into each other,

688
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:53,570
I'm going to make him avoid me.

689
00:43:58,110 --> 00:44:00,980
Fine. But you're not making any sense.

690
00:44:01,909 --> 00:44:05,510
But if anything happens,
promise me you'll call me first.

691
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:07,179
Okay?

692
00:44:09,019 --> 00:44:10,019
Okay.

693
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:14,159
You're all grown up.

694
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:19,630
Wait. Is something going on...

695
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:21,730
with Ba Reum?

696
00:44:22,099 --> 00:44:25,400
- Why?
- He seems to be troubled.

697
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:28,400
He doesn't seem to be
in good condition lately.

698
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,210
He seems to be on edge.

699
00:45:03,769 --> 00:45:05,070
Please...

700
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,980
keep me safe.

701
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:11,909
Please don't let me...

702
00:45:13,579 --> 00:45:16,119
turn into that monster, Sung Yo Han.

703
00:45:21,159 --> 00:45:22,320
Please.

704
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:27,159
Please protect me, Lord.

705
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:40,710
Please.

(Pyeongan Substation)

708
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:20,250
Hello, Detective Shin. How may I help you?

709
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:23,849
I have some good news.

710
00:46:24,849 --> 00:46:27,019
I think you'll soon be transferred
to the Evidence Storage Team.

711
00:46:27,559 --> 00:46:29,590
Should I address you
as Detective Jung from now on?

712
00:46:29,659 --> 00:46:30,690
Is that so?

713
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:33,460
I should call Detective Go and thank him.

714
00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:36,500
No. You should thank
Detective Kang instead.

715
00:46:37,070 --> 00:46:38,570
Detective Kang?

716
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:42,139
He wants you to be by
Detective Go's side at all times.

717
00:46:43,610 --> 00:46:44,769
To be frank,

718
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:47,409
he cares about Detective Go the most.

719
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:50,309
Anyway, congratulations. Hold on.

720
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,019
Hello?

721
00:46:53,150 --> 00:46:55,820
Yes? A murder case?

722
00:46:56,150 --> 00:46:57,619
I'm on my way.

723
00:46:58,849 --> 00:47:01,320
He had called himself a deity.
Did he really resurrect or something?

724
00:47:02,690 --> 00:47:03,690
Officer Jung.

725
00:47:04,090 --> 00:47:06,900
Sung Yo Han's signature was found
at a murder scene.

726
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:09,500
- His signature?
- The finger and the cross.

727
00:47:09,869 --> 00:47:11,170
- I should get going.
- Sir.

728
00:47:11,230 --> 00:47:13,500
Let me tag along.
Can you text me the address?

729
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:30,250
What kind of psychopath mimicked this?

730
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:33,119
It didn't feel right when I heard
that Sung Yo Han had a fan club...

731
00:47:33,159 --> 00:47:34,420
after he died.

732
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:37,389
Look into those members
and identify this body.

733
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:38,530
Yes, sir.

734
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,400
The site's very stable.

735
00:47:49,239 --> 00:47:50,570
It's the work of an expert.

736
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:03,489
- I smell mint.
- When I tussled with him,

737
00:48:03,849 --> 00:48:04,989
it smelled like mint.

738
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,519
It's his scent.

739
00:48:07,159 --> 00:48:08,960
But how could it be here?

740
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:11,059
Could it be...

741
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:16,900
- Did they identify the victim?
- Yes. She was a 10th grader.

742
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:18,530
She lived with her grandfather.

743
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:20,170
- Did you do it?
- Yes.

744
00:48:20,769 --> 00:48:21,840
Listen up.

745
00:48:22,139 --> 00:48:24,010
- Are you the only ones here today?
- Yes.

746
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:27,909
We're going to brief today's incident
as an ordinary murder case,

747
00:48:28,010 --> 00:48:31,679
so make sure the press doesn't think
that Sung Yo Han has a copycat.

748
00:48:31,849 --> 00:48:33,250
But why?

749
00:48:34,849 --> 00:48:38,090
As you all know, the entire country
was traumatized...

750
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:39,349
after witnessing a live murder.

751
00:48:39,389 --> 00:48:40,860
It was only a year ago.

752
00:48:40,889 --> 00:48:42,590
People are finally starting to forget it.

753
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:45,860
So let's not stir up fear
by saying it's a copycat crime.

754
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:48,400
I got an order
to keep the case confidential.

755
00:48:48,429 --> 00:48:50,630
We can't let reporters find out.

756
00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:51,829
Make sure to keep your lips sealed,

757
00:48:51,869 --> 00:48:53,500
and tell those who aren't here too.

758
00:48:53,539 --> 00:48:54,699
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

759
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:01,039
Oh, right. The brooch.

760
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:08,849
Detective Go, did you find
Bong Yi's grandmother's brooch?

761
00:49:08,949 --> 00:49:09,989
It's not here.

762
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:11,449
I think she lost it somewhere else.

763
00:49:11,489 --> 00:49:12,719
I told Bong Yi too.

764
00:49:13,059 --> 00:49:15,920
Please show me the photos
of the basement of Sung Yo Han's house.

765
00:49:16,429 --> 00:49:18,630
- Why suddenly?
- Please hurry.

766
00:49:19,559 --> 00:49:20,860
Gosh, you brat.

767
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,500
Thank you.

768
00:49:32,269 --> 00:49:35,280
Please show me the video
that the killer sent us during the show.

769
00:49:39,349 --> 00:49:40,420
Okay.

770
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:43,019
Detective Go. What?

771
00:49:43,219 --> 00:49:44,650
Hey, what brings you here?

772
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:45,849
I see Officer Jung was here.

773
00:49:46,019 --> 00:49:47,420
I guess he already told you.

774
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:49,659
About what? What is with him?

775
00:49:50,329 --> 00:49:51,389
It looks different.

776
00:49:51,429 --> 00:49:53,929
Then the person who sent this video
might not be Sung Yo Han.

777
00:49:54,030 --> 00:49:57,099
And there's also a possibility
that Sung Yo Han wasn't the killer.

778
00:49:57,869 --> 00:50:00,070
Right. I only remember beating him,
not killing him.

779
00:50:00,139 --> 00:50:02,099
Just because he beat him up,
that doesn't mean he killed him too.

780
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:04,010
If Sung Yo Han wasn't the killer,

781
00:50:04,039 --> 00:50:06,269
the brain transplanted in my head isn't
a murder's brain.

782
00:50:06,309 --> 00:50:08,179
Hey, tell me the details. What signature?

783
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:10,980
Some crazy scum copied
Sung Yo Han's murders.

784
00:50:11,010 --> 00:50:12,409
I don't think it's a copycat crime.

785
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:15,050
I think someone else did this.

786
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:16,389
Take a look.

787
00:50:17,449 --> 00:50:18,949
These two basements look different, right?

788
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:21,519
This isn't the basement
of Sung Yo Han's house.

789
00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:23,429
They look different, I guess.

790
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:25,929
A basement looks different
when you just reposition the furniture.

791
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:28,699
Detective Go, please take a close look.
It's not just the furniture.

792
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:29,769
I guess you're right.

793
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:32,099
We couldn't find Bong Yi's
grandmother's brooch...

794
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:33,639
and Father Go's necklace.

795
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:37,010
Sung Yo Han always took the victims'
belongings after killing them.

796
00:50:37,039 --> 00:50:39,780
Then why weren't there
the brooch and the necklace?

797
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:41,610
Officer Jung has a point.

798
00:50:41,639 --> 00:50:43,550
Then what about Professor Lee and Han Guk?

799
00:50:43,679 --> 00:50:45,050
Their belongings weren't found either.

800
00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:46,949
It's possible that we couldn't find them
If he put them there.

801
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:48,619
- That's true, but...
- If Sung Yo Han wasn't the killer,

802
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:51,650
why were the photos of Byun Soon Young's
body found in his basement?

803
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:54,019
And why would Sung Yo Han have
smashed your head?

804
00:50:54,059 --> 00:50:56,730
Why did he hit you on the head
if he wasn't the killer?

805
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,059
Explain that, you punk.

806
00:50:58,230 --> 00:50:59,730
He's right about that.

807
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,860
- You have a wild imagination...
- You're right about that,

808
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:03,769
but you remember
the mint scent I told you about, right?

809
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:05,969
The scent I smelled when I tussled
with the killer of Bong Yi's grandmother.

810
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,199
I smelled the same scent
at this crime scene.

811
00:51:08,239 --> 00:51:11,239
Hey, there are tons of
mint scented products...

812
00:51:11,309 --> 00:51:12,309
in Korea.

813
00:51:12,369 --> 00:51:13,780
- But...
- Hey!

814
00:51:13,809 --> 00:51:16,010
Why do you seem to hope
that it wasn't Sung Yo Han?

815
00:51:16,110 --> 00:51:19,179
Are you saying that I shot
an innocent man with a gun?

816
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:20,550
Is that the conclusion you want?

817
00:51:20,849 --> 00:51:22,480
- That's not what I mean.
- Leave, you punk.

818
00:51:22,519 --> 00:51:23,820
Why did you come suddenly
and blabber such nonsense?

819
00:51:23,849 --> 00:51:25,789
Get lost. Hurry up and go back
to your substation.

820
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:28,059
- I think he has a point...
- You leave too. Get lost.

821
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:29,559
Go!

822
00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:37,630
Do they think
the Evidence Storage Team is a joke?

823
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,769
Gosh. He's here again.

824
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:43,710
You should've brought the evidence
as soon as you collected it.

825
00:51:43,739 --> 00:51:45,769
Must I come all the way here
to pick it up?

826
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:47,010
Where is it?

827
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:48,539
Is this it?

828
00:51:48,739 --> 00:51:49,880
Yes, that's it.

829
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:51,349
Are you sure this is all?

830
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:54,050
Gosh. I could hear you
making a fuss out in the hallway.

831
00:51:54,349 --> 00:51:56,690
Look at you getting all excited
about joining that team.

832
00:51:57,389 --> 00:51:58,420
(Statement of Opinion)

833
00:51:59,019 --> 00:52:00,460
Was the victim burned alive?

834
00:52:00,489 --> 00:52:02,260
No, her body was burned after the death.

835
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:10,730
(Pyeongan Substation)

836
00:52:10,769 --> 00:52:12,769
- I'm back.
- Hey.

837
00:52:27,019 --> 00:52:29,079
Hello? This is Officer Jung Ba Reum
of Pyeongan Substation.

838
00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:31,289
A suicide case?

839
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:33,989
Why aren't they here yet?

840
00:52:34,719 --> 00:52:37,289
I'll go and see if the paramedics arrived.
Stay here.

841
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:48,570
Mint?

842
00:52:54,210 --> 00:52:56,380
She hanged herself to end her life,

843
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:58,909
but she put her fingers under the rope
to prevent from being choked...

844
00:52:58,949 --> 00:53:00,679
and to get her head out of it.
That doesn't make sense.

845
00:53:01,719 --> 00:53:04,849
Then someone tied it around her neck,

846
00:53:04,989 --> 00:53:07,820
and she put her fingers under it
before it was tightened.

847
00:53:08,219 --> 00:53:09,260
She was killed.

848
00:53:11,030 --> 00:53:14,730
And all the fingers except for the middle
finger have been pulled out.

849
00:53:15,199 --> 00:53:16,360
The killer...

850
00:53:16,670 --> 00:53:20,269
pulled those fingers out intentionally
after she died.

851
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:22,670
Why? Why?

852
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:28,110
The victims' middle fingers
were bent towards the cross.

853
00:53:28,139 --> 00:53:29,210
No way.

854
00:54:15,889 --> 00:54:17,090
I think he's right about that.

855
00:54:18,159 --> 00:54:20,829
I've thought about it.
What Officer Jung said makes sense.

856
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:23,630
It doesn't make sense at all.
You gullible golden boy.

857
00:54:23,869 --> 00:54:25,030
I'm sick of being called that.

858
00:54:25,170 --> 00:54:27,800
I'm just saying that it wouldn't hurt
to hear him out.

859
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:29,769
Leave. You're distracting me.

860
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:34,409
Yes, Officer Jung.

861
00:54:35,179 --> 00:54:37,409
What? You found what?

862
00:54:37,449 --> 00:54:38,449
What is it?

863
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:39,949
It's true.

864
00:54:40,219 --> 00:54:43,750
Father Go's crucifix pendant and
Bong Yi's grandmother's brooch were here.

865
00:54:43,789 --> 00:54:45,550
But when I went to get Officer Nam,

866
00:54:46,349 --> 00:54:47,420
they had gone.

867
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:50,289
That's right. I ran back here
after hearing what he said,

868
00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:51,630
but they weren't here.

869
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:54,530
So Officer Jung is the only one...

870
00:54:54,630 --> 00:54:56,429
- who saw the necklace and the brooch.
- Yes.

871
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:59,170
And you hit your head on the chair
as you fell down.

872
00:55:00,469 --> 00:55:02,500
I saw them before I hit my head on it.

873
00:55:02,539 --> 00:55:05,409
Detective, I'm sure that the killer
took those items.

874
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:08,840
Are you saying that the killer displayed
them on the body and then took them away?

875
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:10,480
Why?

876
00:55:12,050 --> 00:55:15,019
Officer Jung, aren't you too fixated
that someone else killed...

877
00:55:15,050 --> 00:55:16,619
Sung Yo Han's victims?

878
00:55:16,650 --> 00:55:18,250
Detective Shin, they really were here.

879
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:20,119
You can check the CCTV footage.

880
00:55:21,090 --> 00:55:23,590
Do you go out to have fun
without your wife, then?

881
00:55:24,329 --> 00:55:25,789
Check the footage
of the CCTV at the entrance.

882
00:55:26,130 --> 00:55:28,900
I already did, but it was a fake camera.

883
00:55:28,929 --> 00:55:31,429
Please believe me. They were right here.

884
00:55:31,630 --> 00:55:32,929
Are you sure she was murdered?

885
00:55:33,739 --> 00:55:34,840
Did you identify her?

886
00:55:35,699 --> 00:55:37,670
- She worked at an illicit massage parlor?
- Sir.

887
00:55:38,170 --> 00:55:39,940
Please have someone tail Woo Hyeong Cheol.

888
00:55:39,969 --> 00:55:42,280
What? All you do
for an investigation is illegal.

889
00:55:42,309 --> 00:55:45,309
- No.
- Well... The thing is...

(911 Rescue Center)

891
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:50,219
You two search that side.

892
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,420
The killer is someone else.

893
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:56,559
Good. I'll catch that killer
to prove that the brain in my head...

894
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:59,489
is a normal person's brain,
not a murderer's.

895
00:56:01,329 --> 00:56:03,670
(Police)

896
00:56:08,539 --> 00:56:11,440
From the entrance to this point,
it takes three minutes...

897
00:56:12,010 --> 00:56:13,110
at an adult's walking speed.

898
00:56:13,739 --> 00:56:17,949
And the fact that he waited here
and dragged her...

899
00:56:18,650 --> 00:56:20,849
means that he knew
that Kim Jin Ah would pass by here.

900
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:24,820
Then he's someone who knew
where Kim Jin Ah lived,

901
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:27,559
someone who had been stalking
Kim Jin Ah for a long time,

902
00:56:27,590 --> 00:56:29,659
or someone who had visited her house
at least once.

903
00:56:34,030 --> 00:56:36,030
- Yes, Detective Go.
- Hey, where are you?

904
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:37,329
You're not at the substation.

905
00:56:37,570 --> 00:56:40,099
I stepped out to check something.

906
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:41,469
What is it?

907
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:43,510
I have something to tell you.

908
00:56:44,369 --> 00:56:45,769
Let's talk in person. Hurry back.

909
00:56:49,139 --> 00:56:51,710
What is this?
Does he have OCD or something?

910
00:56:52,610 --> 00:56:53,679
This makes me so uncomfortable.

911
00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:55,880
Things like this makes me uncomfortable.

912
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,329
He's working so hard...

913
00:57:11,369 --> 00:57:12,900
- to prove Sung Yo Han's innocence.
- They were...

914
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:14,369
getting along well with each other.

915
00:57:16,369 --> 00:57:19,869
And she got along well
with her daughter as well.

916
00:57:21,909 --> 00:57:24,150
That girl was close to Soon Young.

917
00:57:31,389 --> 00:57:32,789
That's her.

918
00:57:33,289 --> 00:57:36,090
Yes. When Young Hee quit working here,

919
00:57:36,389 --> 00:57:38,130
she recommended Hye Won.

920
00:57:38,489 --> 00:57:40,460
Where is Ms. Park Hye Won now?

921
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,960
It's been almost a year since she quit.

922
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,800
She had a hard time
after what happened to Soon Young.

923
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:48,599
- Then she said she'd get married.
- Getting married?

924
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:50,309
To whom?

925
00:57:50,809 --> 00:57:54,079
I think I heard that he was a lawyer.

926
00:57:54,110 --> 00:57:55,210
A lawyer?

927
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:58,710
She moved out about a year ago
and notified me via text message.

928
00:57:59,050 --> 00:58:02,880
She said she'd move overseas
and asked me to remove her belongings.

929
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:05,250
But she never asked me for the deposit.

930
00:58:05,289 --> 00:58:08,389
So I called her several times,
but couldn't get a hold of her.

931
00:58:08,789 --> 00:58:11,659
She was very meticulous with money
when she was living here.

932
00:58:11,690 --> 00:58:13,289
I got a text message from her.

933
00:58:13,530 --> 00:58:15,159
She said she was leaving Korea,

934
00:58:15,199 --> 00:58:16,599
and that she wouldn't be able to
call me for the time being.

935
00:58:16,929 --> 00:58:18,070
When was it?

936
00:58:18,469 --> 00:58:21,199
It's been almost a year, I think.

937
00:58:21,369 --> 00:58:22,469
Give me a second.

938
00:58:23,710 --> 00:58:24,840
Yes, I was right.

939
00:58:27,539 --> 00:58:29,139
But something was strange.

940
00:58:29,809 --> 00:58:33,050
She never wrote a text message
grammatically correct like this.

941
00:58:33,179 --> 00:58:35,019
It didn't sound like her.

942
00:58:36,949 --> 00:58:39,489
What? There's no record of her
leaving the country?

943
00:58:41,219 --> 00:58:42,360
Okay.

944
00:58:43,989 --> 00:58:45,130
This jerk.

945
00:58:46,530 --> 00:58:48,030
He killed Park Hye Won too.

946
00:58:48,659 --> 00:58:52,269
But how did Woo Hyeong Cheol know
Park Hye Won worked at that bar?

947
00:58:52,599 --> 00:58:53,670
Look at this.

948
00:58:54,070 --> 00:58:56,139
This was when Woo Hyeong Cheol was on TV.

949
00:59:06,510 --> 00:59:09,449
I think I should do some research...

950
00:59:09,519 --> 00:59:11,619
and relay the information.

951
00:59:34,809 --> 00:59:36,110
Yes.

952
00:59:36,610 --> 00:59:38,980
If she tried to break free from the rope,

953
00:59:39,710 --> 00:59:43,349
the rope wouldn't have left
just one clear mark in the dust.

954
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:46,389
That means she was hung
after she was killed,

955
00:59:46,449 --> 00:59:48,119
and the fingers were broken after that.

956
00:59:48,619 --> 00:59:50,789
They were arranged to look like a suicide.

957
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:53,530
She was strangled to death.

958
00:59:55,230 --> 00:59:56,530
Why did we miss this?

959
01:00:04,539 --> 01:00:06,909
Detective Shin, do you have
Kim Jin Ah's autopsy result?

960
01:00:07,010 --> 01:00:08,909
She was Woo Hyeong Cheol's fiancee?

961
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:11,349
She was an orphan,
so no one noticed she was missing.

962
01:00:11,409 --> 01:00:13,309
Everyone thought she moved abroad.

963
01:00:14,150 --> 01:00:15,550
Why did he kill Park Hye Won?

964
01:00:15,619 --> 01:00:19,349
Woo Hyeong Cheol represented
Sung Yo Han's victims.

965
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:23,619
He met Park Hye Won
who gave a statement on Byun Soon Young,

966
01:00:23,730 --> 01:00:27,260
and I think that's how he found out
Park Hye Won worked at the same bar.

967
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:29,099
Then what about Kim Young Hee?

968
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:31,929
Did he kill her because
she was Park Hye Won's friend?

969
01:00:32,570 --> 01:00:34,400
Kim Young Hee worked there first.

970
01:00:34,539 --> 01:00:36,469
She quit and recommended Park Hye Won.

971
01:00:36,599 --> 01:00:38,570
- That's why he killed her.
- What for?

972
01:00:38,769 --> 01:00:41,710
This scumbag is punishing women
whom he thinks,

973
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:44,409
by his twisted standard, are not chaste.

974
01:00:44,679 --> 01:00:48,179
He took Kang Min Joo for a gold-digger
when he saw her enter a motel with a guy.

975
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:52,119
He saw Hong Na Ri with another man
when she wasn't yet legally divorced.

976
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:54,519
Then why did he try to kill Oh Bong Yi?

977
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,860
Woo Hyeong Cheol
used to defend Kang Deok Soo.

978
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:59,889
Though he quit and
Kang Deok Soo got another lawyer.

979
01:01:00,090 --> 01:01:03,460
He must have all the details on
all of Kang Deok Soo's victims.

980
01:01:03,530 --> 01:01:05,400
Oh Bong Yi being Kang Deok Soo's victim...

981
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:07,469
and Woo Hyeong Cheol's standard
of picking victims.

982
01:01:07,539 --> 01:01:08,869
There's nothing in common.

983
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:13,210
But why weren't Park Hye Won
and Kim Young Hee's bodies displayed?

984
01:01:13,510 --> 01:01:15,110
He lacked confidence at first.

985
01:01:15,679 --> 01:01:18,780
Then he gradually grew bolder...

986
01:01:18,909 --> 01:01:20,920
and started to display the bodies.

987
01:01:23,619 --> 01:01:26,320
We must find Park Hye Won
and Kim Young Hee's bodies.

988
01:01:26,389 --> 01:01:28,019
Or the murder weapon.

989
01:01:28,690 --> 01:01:31,889
For now, that's the only way to get him.

990
01:01:40,269 --> 01:01:41,900
Let's start with
Woo Hyeong Cheol's close...

991
01:01:44,170 --> 01:01:45,139
Yes, ma'am.

992
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:51,449
I have to go.

993
01:01:55,820 --> 01:01:59,650
("Coerced Police Investigation
of the Knot Murders")

994
01:02:08,699 --> 01:02:10,730
- Can I have the prescription?
- Sure.

995
01:02:13,570 --> 01:02:15,769
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

996
01:02:21,809 --> 01:02:22,940
Let's go.

997
01:02:26,010 --> 01:02:27,150
Mr. Woo?

998
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:29,619
- Come in.
- Okay.

999
01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:37,190
It's been rough, hasn't it?

1000
01:02:37,530 --> 01:02:39,929
The police had to go after the wrong guy.

1001
01:02:41,199 --> 01:02:43,869
The iron supplements you asked for.
They were hard to get.

1002
01:02:44,599 --> 01:02:46,030
How's your wife's morning sickness?

1003
01:02:46,869 --> 01:02:48,599
It got much better.

1004
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:53,639
Your previous patient.
Wasn't that Choi Hong Ju the producer?

1005
01:02:53,710 --> 01:02:54,780
It was.

1006
01:02:55,239 --> 01:02:57,880
Really? I thought she was single.

1007
01:02:58,650 --> 01:03:00,880
There was a rumor after Sung Yo Han died.

1008
01:03:01,219 --> 01:03:03,750
That Choi Hong Ju and that murderer dated.

1009
01:03:04,019 --> 01:03:06,849
I actually gave the tip to
a reporter friend of mine.

1010
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:09,090
I heard it myself while having a drink.

1011
01:03:09,190 --> 01:03:11,289
There are so many other men.

1012
01:03:11,630 --> 01:03:12,929
Why did you pick him?

1013
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:17,170
Did you?

1014
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:21,000
You found acetone?

1015
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:24,469
Acetone evaporates very quickly,

1016
01:03:24,539 --> 01:03:26,940
so it can catch fire fast
even with a spark.

1017
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:30,909
It's not hazardous like hydrochloric acid,
and can be bought in bulk.

1018
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:34,980
Was the cause of death strangulation?

1019
01:03:36,019 --> 01:03:38,820
No. If she was strangled, however weakly,

1020
01:03:38,889 --> 01:03:41,389
her hyoid or cartilage would've snapped.

1021
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:43,119
This body has no fractures.

1022
01:03:43,489 --> 01:03:46,329
If she was strangled with something wide,

1023
01:03:46,389 --> 01:03:48,900
like a towel,
that could've left no fractures.

1024
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:54,440
Can you please check for congestion?

1025
01:04:05,079 --> 01:04:08,849
Officer Jung. Con... Conquestion?

1026
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:10,820
- Congestion?
- Yes. What's that?

1027
01:04:11,590 --> 01:04:14,860
Oh, that? When someone's strangled,

1028
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:16,389
pressure is put on the jugular,

1029
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:19,460
stopping blood from going to the heart
and turning one's face red.

1030
01:04:19,829 --> 01:04:22,000
The external carotid artery
around the head and face...

1031
01:04:22,059 --> 01:04:23,500
causes facial congestion.

1032
01:04:23,559 --> 01:04:26,000
Facial congestion
causes congestion in the skull,

1033
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:28,300
including on a bone
called the centrum that's in the skull.

1034
01:04:28,369 --> 01:04:31,170
The congestion on the bone
is crucial evidence.

1035
01:04:35,309 --> 01:04:36,980
Did you go to medical school?

1036
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:38,349
No, I didn't go to college.

1037
01:04:38,710 --> 01:04:41,480
What? Then how do you know all that?

1038
01:04:42,219 --> 01:04:44,190
Wasn't all that medical lingo?

1039
01:04:44,590 --> 01:04:45,849
Well...

1040
01:04:48,519 --> 01:04:49,920
I just knew.

1041
01:04:50,190 --> 01:04:51,230
You just knew?

1042
01:04:52,230 --> 01:04:53,590
You're smart.

1043
01:04:56,530 --> 01:04:58,699
Because Sung Yo Han was a doctor.

1044
01:04:59,670 --> 01:05:01,940
Jae Pil did nothing wrong...

1045
01:05:02,139 --> 01:05:03,400
and I killed him?

1046
01:05:03,570 --> 01:05:07,280
I'm pretty sure Woo Jae Pil knew
what his son was doing.

1047
01:05:07,610 --> 01:05:09,179
Why did Hyeong Cheol...

1048
01:05:09,809 --> 01:05:11,380
hurt my Soo Jin?

1049
01:05:12,809 --> 01:05:16,119
Do you have anything to tell me
about Woo Hyeong Cheol?

1050
01:05:16,179 --> 01:05:17,320
Anything that could be a clue?

1051
01:05:18,050 --> 01:05:21,559
Hyeong Cheol's mom tried to kill him
and take her own life.

1052
01:05:22,019 --> 01:05:24,659
Ambulances came to the neighborhood.
There was a huge ruckus.

1053
01:05:25,989 --> 01:05:28,230
What did he do to be called a murderer?

1054
01:05:28,699 --> 01:05:31,070
Oh. A short while before that,

1055
01:05:31,269 --> 01:05:34,739
Chang Soo took Hyeong Cheol's mom
to Guryeong Village.

1056
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:36,500
Chang Soo?

1057
01:05:36,639 --> 01:05:39,539
Hyeong Cheol's mom's brother.
They lived in the same area.

1058
01:05:39,639 --> 01:05:41,010
He should still be there.

1059
01:05:41,210 --> 01:05:42,210
(Laboratory Medicine)

1060
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:43,739
- Officer Jung.
- Hello.

1061
01:05:44,550 --> 01:05:45,750
You were right.

1062
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:48,920
It's faint, but there's congestion
on the centrum.

1063
01:05:49,420 --> 01:05:52,420
Like you said, this woman was strangled.

1064
01:05:52,849 --> 01:05:56,190
I found ash in her bronchial tubes,
so I didn't suspect strangulation.

1065
01:05:56,690 --> 01:05:58,289
I'd have missed it
if it hadn't been for you.

1066
01:05:58,889 --> 01:06:00,130
What's up, Officer Jung?

1067
01:06:01,059 --> 01:06:02,199
That's fascinating.

1068
01:06:02,929 --> 01:06:06,269
It snowed a lot that day.

1069
01:06:06,329 --> 01:06:08,400
It was some hotel.

1070
01:06:08,969 --> 01:06:10,940
I was waiting in the car.

1071
01:06:11,139 --> 01:06:12,440
Gosh, it's cold.

1072
01:06:13,539 --> 01:06:16,039
She met someone in the lobby.

1073
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:18,179
It looked like she was pleading.

1074
01:06:18,409 --> 01:06:21,750
My sister was very anxious
since that meeting.

1075
01:06:22,380 --> 01:06:25,019
She then asked me to
take her to Seoul one more time.

1076
01:06:25,090 --> 01:06:26,190
So I did.

1077
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:27,619
Was it to the same hotel?

1078
01:06:29,059 --> 01:06:32,059
It was some laboratory building.

1079
01:06:32,730 --> 01:06:36,630
Anyway, after she got back,
she totally lost it.

1080
01:06:36,699 --> 01:06:39,000
Then she tried to
drug Hyeong Cheol and herself.

1081
01:06:39,199 --> 01:06:40,699
She eventually jumped.

1082
01:06:42,269 --> 01:06:43,570
What are those flowers?

1083
01:06:46,610 --> 01:06:47,639
Hydrangeas.

1084
01:06:47,739 --> 01:06:50,480
My sister loved purple hydrangeas.

1085
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:52,880
Hyeong Cheol was a good boy.

1086
01:06:52,949 --> 01:06:55,880
He'd visit sometimes
to check on his mom's grave.

1087
01:06:58,289 --> 01:06:59,389
Not all of them...

1088
01:07:00,050 --> 01:07:02,219
are purple. Some of them are blue.

1089
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:04,789
To make the flowers turn purple,

1090
01:07:04,860 --> 01:07:07,230
you must sprinkle lime onto the soil.

1091
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:09,059
There's not enough, I guess.

1092
01:07:10,099 --> 01:07:13,869
If the hydrangeas are blue,
it means the soil is acidic.

1093
01:07:16,940 --> 01:07:18,969
Hang on, acidic soil?

1094
01:07:19,610 --> 01:07:21,440
That means there's a lot of iron.

1095
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:23,039
That's right.

1096
01:07:27,449 --> 01:07:29,550
What are you doing? Stop!

1097
01:07:29,719 --> 01:07:32,349
Stop! You're ruining the flowerbed!

1098
01:07:32,420 --> 01:07:33,449
Get off me.

1099
01:07:33,750 --> 01:07:37,360
Iron means metal. It could be the weapon.

1100
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:45,199
Excuse me.

1101
01:07:47,329 --> 01:07:48,440
I'm a police officer.

1102
01:07:49,199 --> 01:07:52,369
Did your granddaughter
ever run away from home?

1103
01:07:53,769 --> 01:07:57,039
Jin Ah left home a year ago.

1104
01:07:57,239 --> 01:07:59,949
She hung around some guys...

1105
01:08:00,050 --> 01:08:01,780
and stressed me out so much.

1106
01:08:01,949 --> 01:08:05,989
I thought she'd finally come home
to lead a normal life.

1107
01:08:08,219 --> 01:08:10,719
Sir. The reason your granddaughter...

1108
01:08:10,789 --> 01:08:12,730
decided to come back home.

1109
01:08:13,030 --> 01:08:17,159
Was it because someone
counseled her and helped her return?

1110
01:08:17,329 --> 01:08:19,529
Yes. There was this good man.

1111
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:22,170
He turned Jin Ah around
and brought her home.

1112
01:08:23,970 --> 01:08:25,170
Okay, so...

1113
01:08:26,010 --> 01:08:28,380
That good man.

1114
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:30,380
Is it him?

1115
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:32,850
Yes. That's him.

1116
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:37,079
- Call me any time.
- Who was that?

1117
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:40,520
Mr. Woo consults
runaway teenagers for free.

1118
01:08:40,550 --> 01:08:42,020
He convinced many to return home.

1119
01:09:49,460 --> 01:09:50,859
Where is Woo Hyeong Cheol right now?

1120
01:09:50,890 --> 01:09:52,090
Darn it.

1121
01:09:52,590 --> 01:09:54,500
I got into an accident and lost him.

1122
01:09:54,529 --> 01:09:57,670
Hey! I told you to keep an eye on him!

1123
01:09:58,069 --> 01:09:59,770
Put out an APB this instant...

1124
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:01,239
and track his phone and vehicle.

1125
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:06,210
From runaway teenagers to masseuses...

1126
01:10:07,369 --> 01:10:09,510
He killed those whom he believed...

1127
01:10:09,539 --> 01:10:11,510
were promiscuous.

1128
01:10:12,180 --> 01:10:13,279
Who could be his next target?

1129
01:10:13,750 --> 01:10:16,020
Why couldn't I reach you all day?

1130
01:10:16,119 --> 01:10:17,220
Dong Goo.

1131
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:21,489
I sent you the script for my wedding
tomorrow, but you didn't check.

1132
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:23,920
I called you to give you your suit,
but you didn't pick up.

1133
01:10:24,159 --> 01:10:26,729
Right. It's your wedding tomorrow.

1134
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:28,560
Right, I guess it is.

1135
01:10:29,829 --> 01:10:31,670
Do you want to die?

1136
01:10:31,699 --> 01:10:33,100
Hurry up and open the door.

1137
01:10:52,350 --> 01:10:54,119
("Girlfriend of a Heinous Serial Killer
Is a Famous Producer")

1138
01:10:57,390 --> 01:11:00,090
I got you an expensive one
since you didn't have any suits.

1139
01:11:01,060 --> 01:11:03,829
What a jerk. You forgot
the date of my wedding.

1140
01:11:04,470 --> 01:11:05,729
- I'm sorry.
- Let me see.

1141
01:11:06,699 --> 01:11:09,739
Gosh, you sure look different.

1142
01:11:09,970 --> 01:11:12,109
You look great in a suit.

1143
01:11:12,909 --> 01:11:14,739
- Let's see.
- Why would you take a photo?

1144
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:15,979
Stay still.

1145
01:11:17,039 --> 01:11:18,149
Okay.

1146
01:11:20,149 --> 01:11:22,680
Why hasn't Seul Gi been reading my texts?

1147
01:11:23,180 --> 01:11:24,590
She hasn't been picking up
my calls either.

1148
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:26,319
I told you, it's not too late.

1149
01:11:26,350 --> 01:11:28,890
Reconsider your decision to marry her.

1150
01:11:29,020 --> 01:11:31,659
She won't give up on her dream.

1151
01:11:33,430 --> 01:11:35,430
Where does she live? Where?

1152
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:43,399
Choi Hong Ju.

1153
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:49,039
What? How may I help you?

1154
01:11:49,539 --> 01:11:51,680
Dong Goo got in a fight...

1155
01:11:51,710 --> 01:11:52,909
and was taken to the police station.

1156
01:11:52,949 --> 01:11:54,250
What? Why?

1157
01:11:54,949 --> 01:11:56,979
Is he badly injured?
Where is he right now?

1158
01:11:57,020 --> 01:11:59,149
Let me go inside and explain.

1159
01:11:59,189 --> 01:12:00,220
Sure.

1160
01:12:02,590 --> 01:12:03,689
Come on in.

1161
01:12:14,270 --> 01:12:15,369
What is it?

1162
01:12:16,270 --> 01:12:17,300
I'm glad.

1163
01:12:18,310 --> 01:12:19,770
I...

1164
01:13:04,890 --> 01:13:07,189
Seul Gi! Are you in there?

1165
01:13:07,590 --> 01:13:09,859
Call 911 and get me a pair of pliers.

1166
01:13:10,159 --> 01:13:11,229
Hurry.

1167
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:25,630
Are you up?

1168
01:15:32,770 --> 01:15:34,399
I should've killed her,

1169
01:15:34,869 --> 01:15:36,170
but you ruined everything.

1170
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,609
I should encourage him to keep talking.

1171
01:15:38,869 --> 01:15:40,869
He won't kill me when he's talking.

1172
01:15:46,850 --> 01:15:48,020
You killed them all, didn't you?

1173
01:15:48,220 --> 01:15:50,619
Yes. I did.

1174
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:52,949
Why?

1175
01:15:53,750 --> 01:15:54,920
What's your reason?

1176
01:15:56,359 --> 01:15:57,390
"Reason"?

1177
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:03,500
I punished them.

1178
01:16:04,359 --> 01:16:05,899
Those promiscuous wenches.

1179
01:16:07,630 --> 01:16:08,640
All of them.

1180
01:16:10,039 --> 01:16:11,869
- Did you have fun today?
- Yes.

1181
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:14,810
You have such a pretty smile.

1182
01:16:16,279 --> 01:16:19,510
I wish I had a beautiful daughter
like you, Soo Jin.

1183
01:16:19,779 --> 01:16:21,380
Don't buy anything too sweet.

1184
01:16:21,420 --> 01:16:23,279
- Okay.
- Come visit whenever you want.

1185
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:25,590
- Thank you.
- No problem.

1186
01:16:30,020 --> 01:16:31,090
Soo Jin!

1187
01:16:31,260 --> 01:16:32,359
Dad!

1188
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:36,130
Hyeong Cheol, I'm a bit busy right now.
I'll call you back later.

1189
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:37,659
Dad!

1190
01:16:39,329 --> 01:16:43,199
I think... I think Soo Jin is dead!

1191
01:16:52,979 --> 01:16:54,510
- At Boy Scout,
- At Boy Scout,

1192
01:16:55,020 --> 01:16:56,920
- I learned how to make a rescue knot.
- I learned how to make a rescue knot.

1193
01:16:56,949 --> 01:17:00,750
- I made a mistake while practicing.
- I made a mistake while practicing.

1194
01:17:01,189 --> 01:17:02,560
- What should I do?
- What should I do?

1195
01:17:07,159 --> 01:17:09,159
I shed a few tears as well,
and they bought it.

1196
01:17:09,399 --> 01:17:11,829
Twist the rope slightly to the right
with the left hand.

1197
01:17:11,869 --> 01:17:13,529
Place the right hand on top.

1198
01:17:15,770 --> 01:17:17,600
I guess my acting was pretty realistic.

1199
01:17:19,710 --> 01:17:22,510
I'm sure your father just wanted
to believe that it was a mistake.

1200
01:17:24,340 --> 01:17:26,779
Honey, I think...

1201
01:17:27,380 --> 01:17:29,180
Hyeong Cheol...

1202
01:17:29,220 --> 01:17:31,350
What? He said it was a mistake!

1203
01:17:31,619 --> 01:17:33,350
What are you thinking?

1204
01:17:37,390 --> 01:17:38,289
(The Kid's Family Is Desperately Waiting
for Their Child)

1205
01:17:38,829 --> 01:17:42,359
The whole country was fixated on
the Headhunter case.

1206
01:17:42,430 --> 01:17:44,300
Your father came up with a plan.

1207
01:17:44,399 --> 01:17:46,329
He bought the same clothes
and shoes as Park Hyeon Soo's.

1208
01:17:46,630 --> 01:17:48,340
The detective on the case...

1209
01:17:48,399 --> 01:17:50,739
would've had no problem getting some DNA.

1210
01:17:51,039 --> 01:17:54,069
Even if the body was found,
to derail the investigation,

1211
01:17:54,140 --> 01:17:55,640
he made a Park Hyeon Soo.

1212
01:17:55,710 --> 01:17:57,310
No.

1213
01:17:57,680 --> 01:18:00,310
It wasn't my dad's idea. It was mine.

1214
01:18:00,380 --> 01:18:02,649
- It was my idea.
- You killed your mother, didn't you?

1215
01:18:05,189 --> 01:18:08,590
She'd given the now dead Daniel Lee
some of my hair.

1216
01:18:09,060 --> 01:18:10,359
He told her that...

1217
01:18:11,659 --> 01:18:13,460
I was born a psychopath.

1218
01:18:16,699 --> 01:18:18,130
Why did you kill Soo Jin?

1219
01:18:19,229 --> 01:18:20,569
Because she's like you.

1220
01:18:21,470 --> 01:18:23,340
She has dimples like you,

1221
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:25,810
and her pinkie is short, like yours.

1222
01:18:27,039 --> 01:18:28,310
She's your daughter, isn't she?

1223
01:18:29,479 --> 01:18:31,579
You cheated with Mr. Jeong and had her.

1224
01:18:32,979 --> 01:18:34,050
What?

1225
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:35,779
No?

1226
01:18:36,579 --> 01:18:37,680
Forget it, then.

1227
01:18:54,430 --> 01:18:57,500
Don't worry. I'll be right with you.

1228
01:19:05,310 --> 01:19:06,550
No!

1229
01:19:09,250 --> 01:19:10,619
No.

1230
01:19:10,819 --> 01:19:13,149
But Park Hye Won was just like my mom.

1231
01:19:13,220 --> 01:19:16,119
How dare she think of becoming my wife?

1232
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:19,529
So I killed them.
The obscene, debauched women.

1233
01:19:19,829 --> 01:19:21,699
I judged them in the name of the deity.

1234
01:19:21,829 --> 01:19:23,159
What about the others?

1235
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:25,329
Who?

1236
01:19:30,699 --> 01:19:31,810
Oh Bong Yi?

1237
01:19:35,939 --> 01:19:37,079
Don't you get it?

1238
01:19:39,479 --> 01:19:42,380
You son of a witch. How dare you say that?

1239
01:19:42,449 --> 01:19:44,020
What are you talking about?

1240
01:19:47,619 --> 01:19:49,119
Shut your dirty mouth.

1241
01:19:55,329 --> 01:19:58,000
Song Soo Ho, Kim Sung Gyu,
Byun Soon Young.

1242
01:19:58,329 --> 01:20:01,569
Cho Mi Jeong and Bong Yi's grandmother.
Why did you kill them?

1243
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:04,270
What are you talking about?

1244
01:20:04,369 --> 01:20:05,869
Those are the people Sung Yo Han killed.

1245
01:20:05,939 --> 01:20:07,539
Don't lie! You killed them all.

1246
01:20:07,609 --> 01:20:10,109
Like your father,
Sung Yo Han took the blame and died.

1247
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:13,079
So you wouldn't get caught,
you pretended that Sung Yo Han did it.

1248
01:20:13,149 --> 01:20:15,720
As if someone else had done it.
Right? Didn't you?

1249
01:20:15,819 --> 01:20:17,420
What are you on about?

1250
01:20:17,550 --> 01:20:19,890
I heard you got brain surgery.

1251
01:20:20,319 --> 01:20:21,819
You lost your mind completely.

1252
01:20:22,489 --> 01:20:25,060
Don't lie. It was all you.

1253
01:20:25,189 --> 01:20:28,600
Father Go's necklace and
Bong Yi's grandma's brooch. You left them.

1254
01:20:29,399 --> 01:20:30,460
Didn't you?

1255
01:20:31,130 --> 01:20:32,569
You lunatic.

1256
01:20:59,659 --> 01:21:01,329
It was Sung Yo Han.

1257
01:21:02,329 --> 01:21:03,600
It was him.

1258
01:21:14,939 --> 01:21:16,140
Over here.

1259
01:21:19,510 --> 01:21:20,680
Over here.

1260
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:30,989
Kill him. Kill him.

1261
01:21:31,319 --> 01:21:32,659
He deserves to die.

1262
01:21:36,760 --> 01:21:40,630
Yes. Harder. Harder, harder.

1263
01:22:18,909 --> 01:22:21,510
What now? I think he's dead.

1264
01:22:24,210 --> 01:22:25,310
How does it feel?

1265
01:22:31,689 --> 01:22:32,819
You.

1266
01:22:33,789 --> 01:22:35,119
Isn't it thrilling?

1267
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:37,119
The feel of a kill.
