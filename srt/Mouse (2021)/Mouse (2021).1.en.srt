(The animal scenes are CGI.)

11
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,020
Wow, this is cool.

12
00:00:44,149 --> 00:00:45,179
It stood up.

13
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:48,590
The black snake is the largest snake
that lives in our country.

14
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:49,820
What?

15
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,960
- Teacher, what do...
- Teacher, what do...

16
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,759
- black snakes eat?
- black snakes eat?

17
00:00:53,829 --> 00:00:57,159
Black snakes eat frogs,
sparrows, rodents...

18
00:00:57,829 --> 00:00:59,259
And they eat mice.

19
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:02,869
- They eat mice.
- They eat mice?

20
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:05,840
The black snake is the snake
you read about in old folk tales.

21
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:08,709
- It's so big, isn't it?
- Yes.

22
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:11,209
It's bigger than I thought.

23
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,079
It's a thousand times bigger.

24
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,909
I thought that...

25
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:17,219
- it would be small.
- There's a mouse.

26
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:19,420
- There's a mouse.
- There's a real mouse.

27
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,450
- Oh, no.
- No.

28
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:22,650
No.

29
00:01:23,859 --> 00:01:26,590
Will the mouse get eaten by the snake?

30
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:02,329
(Mouse)

31
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:08,469
(5 years later)

32
00:02:23,449 --> 00:02:24,719
It was the first time...

33
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,819
I'd come here myself.

34
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,199
I wanted to ask.

35
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,330
Do you think...

36
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,840
I look different too?

37
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:48,240
I was different from the start.

38
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:50,909
I was born different...

39
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:53,479
from the beginning.

40
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:13,770
(10 years ago)

41
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:24,580
(Episode 1)

42
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,389
Thank you.

43
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:10,389
Hi, Soo Ah. Where's Mom? Is she asleep?

44
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:13,289
It's snowing so hard that...

45
00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:15,460
the taxi can't go all the way.

46
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,660
What else could I do?

47
00:04:18,129 --> 00:04:20,899
I couldn't miss
the new employee welcome party.

48
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:24,500
No, don't come out.

49
00:04:24,569 --> 00:04:27,139
You have an exam tomorrow.
You need to be in good shape.

50
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,970
Okay. I'll be home soon.

51
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:32,279
Bye.

52
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,259
Ma'am.

53
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:51,199
Ma'am.

54
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,139
Hey, kid. What are you doing
out here at this hour?

55
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:07,850
Our car... It skidded...

56
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,750
and crashed into a tree.

57
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:14,790
And my dad...

58
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,220
Where is he?

59
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,220
Over there.

60
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,079
He'll be fine.

61
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,680
Hold this for a minute.

62
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,060
Sir.

63
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:57,060
Sir. Sir?

64
00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:06,470
Spare me.

65
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:09,370
No...

66
00:06:14,649 --> 00:06:16,610
Don't do that.

67
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,449
Please stop.

68
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:29,160
Let me explain it one more time.

69
00:06:29,329 --> 00:06:31,829
Check your gears after jumping in.

70
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,769
Remove the air
from your buoyancy control device...

71
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:36,199
and descend very slowly.

72
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,199
The water temperature is quite low,

73
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,740
so there's a high risk of an accident.

74
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:44,939
Make sure you stay with the group.
Understood?

75
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,779
Another headless body has been found.

76
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:22,680
This time, it was in the ocean.

77
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:25,779
- Hey!
- No, stop!

78
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:27,519
The DNA result showed that
the body belonged...

79
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:29,250
to a woman in her 20s named Song.

80
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:32,819
She was reported missing
on her way home one week ago.

81
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,290
Judging by the severity of the attack...

82
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:37,829
and a similar marking left behind,

83
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,899
the police believe it's the same killer,

84
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,829
and are currently investigating.

85
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:44,939
Headhunter, a perverted killer...

86
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,670
who murders their victims
and cuts off their heads,

87
00:07:47,709 --> 00:07:49,870
has now murdered a total of 18 victims.

88
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,709
For the past year,

89
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,050
the police hadn't made any progress.

90
00:07:54,149 --> 00:07:56,879
The public's fear has now turned
into rage.

91
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,350
The President canceled
all of his appointments...

92
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,889
and visited the National Police Agency.

93
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:04,490
This was Reporter Kang Mun Jin
of Modu Daily.

94
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:08,629
It is believed that the President
made this visit...

95
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,430
as a way of winning public sentiment...

96
00:08:10,459 --> 00:08:13,000
and making up for the decrease
in the approval rating.

97
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,199
During the briefing,

98
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:17,670
the President rebuked
the police's lack of competence...

99
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:21,939
upon hearing that the killer
hadn't been narrowed down.

100
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:25,439
He has announced that he himself
would come up with a countermeasure.

101
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,050
- During the past year...
- He also announced to the public...

102
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,620
that he would come up
with a countermeasure...

103
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,350
to stabilize public security...

104
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:35,950
and create a crime-free society.

105
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,820
So is it like distinguishing
the gender of the chicks?

106
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,289
That's a great analogy.

107
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,159
How was it verified
that it was the top one percent...

108
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,029
of a psychopath's genes?

109
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:45,330
Right here.

110
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,639
Charles Manson,

111
00:08:50,669 --> 00:08:54,970
who killed a total of 35 people
including actress Sharon Tate.

112
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,340
Edmund Kemper,

113
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:59,340
who killed, cut off the heads,

114
00:08:59,409 --> 00:09:02,610
and raped the corpses
of six teenage girls...

115
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:05,250
as well as his grandparents and mother.

116
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,580
Ted Bundy.

117
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:08,250
A serial killer...

118
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:12,389
who considered murder as a sport
and ate human flesh.

119
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,029
As a result of the British government...

120
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:18,559
and the US FBI's joint control test,

121
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,899
their genes and the psychopath's genes...

122
00:09:20,929 --> 00:09:24,799
I found were 100-percent identical.

123
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:28,340
It doesn't stop there. Sooner or later,

124
00:09:28,409 --> 00:09:29,769
there will be a world...

125
00:09:29,809 --> 00:09:32,379
where you can know in advance whether...

126
00:09:32,909 --> 00:09:35,750
the child in its mother's womb will be...

127
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:41,090
Charles Manson,
Edmund Kemper, or Ted Bundy.

128
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,690
Wow, but how?

129
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,320
Well, let's call it a day.

130
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,330
- Professor.
- Tell us more, professor!

131
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,860
- Yes, please tell us more!
- Come on.

132
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:55,899
Hello?

133
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,299
Okay.

134
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:02,570
Sorry.

135
00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:06,679
No classes next week.
I'll be gone for a while.

136
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,580
Has he arrived?

137
00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:10,210
He took half a day off?

138
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:13,649
Wait for him
and immediately escort him here.

139
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:16,950
This is quite a spectacle.

140
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,820
This is definitely going to turn the tide.

141
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,090
We must make it go through at all costs.

142
00:10:22,129 --> 00:10:23,529
The problem is the opposition party.

143
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:25,100
They won't agree to it that easily.

144
00:10:25,129 --> 00:10:26,860
The ruling party has made
its bid for victory.

145
00:10:26,929 --> 00:10:27,730
They're probably panicking.

146
00:10:27,769 --> 00:10:30,230
Their approval rating hit rock bottom.
They have their lame-duck as well.

147
00:10:30,269 --> 00:10:31,940
This is our golden opportunity.

148
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:33,769
- We must stop them at all costs.
- How?

149
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,610
They're going to mention human rights.

150
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:38,610
- "Human rights"?
- There was a similar case in England.

151
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,610
The government wanted to store...

152
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,980
every single civilian's DNA
in their system.

153
00:10:42,049 --> 00:10:43,750
They also wanted to find
potential killer's DNA...

154
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:45,379
and prevent the crimes from happening.

155
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,720
That's what they wanted to do.

156
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,190
- Was it approved?
- No.

157
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,320
Dear passengers,
our plane will soon land...

158
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,029
at Gimpo International Airport.

159
00:10:54,059 --> 00:10:55,559
Ladies and gentlemen,

160
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:58,029
we'll arrive
at Gimpo International Airport...

161
00:10:58,059 --> 00:11:00,460
The opposing side argued
about human rights.

162
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:03,029
They valued human rights
more than people's lives?

163
00:11:03,169 --> 00:11:05,769
Unbelievable. A fetus has no rights.

164
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,379
Hey, Seo Joon. I just arrived.

165
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,179
Okay. I'll see you right after work.

166
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:21,950
Okay.

167
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:24,720
Thank you.

168
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:32,730
The killer is extremely smart
and meticulous,

169
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,600
so they said it's going to be a long run.

170
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:36,970
Or rather, they might catch
the killer sooner than they think.

171
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:39,539
Psychopaths like this one
are too arrogant...

172
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:41,639
that they sometimes make dumb mistakes.

173
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:45,409
Psychopaths are created by mutated DNA...

174
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,940
as society evolves.

175
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:49,549
They're born with little MAOA genes...

176
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,850
which control human emotions.

177
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:56,919
The top one-percent psychopaths
who may end up as serial killers...

178
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,519
have no MAOA genes.

179
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,120
Through my study,

180
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:01,889
I found out that it's possible...

181
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:05,000
to distinguish the DNA
of potential psychopaths.

182
00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:07,159
In other words, it is possible
to determine which of them...

183
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,299
will become psychopaths,

184
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:12,070
or serial killers
even before they're born.

185
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,100
(Chairman Shin Sung Min)

186
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,909
This is the end of the presentation
about my new DNA project.

187
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:18,440
For more details, please look
at the materials I've handed out.

188
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:19,809
(Jung Joong Seok, Kim Woo Seon)

189
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,950
Therefore, the government
would like to create a bill...

190
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,809
that makes DNA tests
for fetuses mandatory.

191
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:26,080
And if the DNA matches that
of a potential psychopath's,

192
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,720
the government should be able
to abort the fetus...

193
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:32,490
for public safety
without the mother's consent.

194
00:12:33,289 --> 00:12:36,490
All right. We'd like to hear
from the assembly.

195
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,029
I'm for it.

196
00:12:38,059 --> 00:12:40,500
Had Headhunter never been born,

197
00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:43,830
18... No, dozens of innocent lives...

198
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,500
wouldn't have been lost in vain.

199
00:12:45,539 --> 00:12:47,070
Had Hitler never been born,

200
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,440
there would've been no world wars.

201
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:52,009
I believe this bill will offer...

202
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:55,250
an absolutely perfect measure
in preventing crimes.

203
00:12:55,549 --> 00:12:56,809
Professor Lee.

204
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,779
Is the DNA test accurate?

205
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,850
It's 99-percent accurate.

206
00:13:01,889 --> 00:13:03,320
99 percent?

207
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,960
What about the remaining one percent?

208
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,120
That would be a genius's DNA.

209
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:09,029
If you were to compare
a psychopath's DNA to a genius's,

210
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:12,500
they're extremely similar
that even I can't distinguish them.

211
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:15,570
So you're saying you could kill
a potential Mozart,

212
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:17,470
thinking he was a potential Hitler.

213
00:13:17,669 --> 00:13:21,210
Or you could kill a potential Einstein,
thinking he was a potential Headhunter.

214
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:24,340
Forget about everything.
This is a breach of human rights.

215
00:13:24,379 --> 00:13:26,240
"Human rights"? What rights?

216
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:28,250
How could a fetus
possibly have any rights?

217
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:31,350
Abortion is illegal in this country.

218
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,950
That law was created...

219
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,620
because we considered fetuses
as human beings...

220
00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:36,490
and believed it was murder!

221
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:40,490
Then will you just sit and watch
if you let a murderer be born...

222
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:42,190
and they end up killing people?

223
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:45,299
If you care so much
about fetuses' human rights,

224
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:47,600
why can't you do the same
for the victims' rights?

225
00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:49,429
If you care so much
about the victims' human rights,

226
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,740
why haven't you caught the Headhunter?

227
00:13:51,769 --> 00:13:53,440
Why have you resorted
to this cheap method?

228
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:55,340
"Cheap method"? Is that what you said?

229
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:56,740
Yes, it was. So what?

230
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:58,610
- Come on.
- How is this a cheap method?

231
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,480
- How is it not?
- That's enough.

232
00:14:01,809 --> 00:14:04,750
- How dare you?
- What are you talking about?

233
00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:05,850
- Are you serious?
- That's enough.

234
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:07,950
Are you done talking?

235
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,919
Let's take a break.

236
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:12,120
(Kim Woo Seon)

237
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:15,230
Now, we will vote
on whether to pass this bill or not.

238
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,330
The government proposed a bill
that'd make DNA tests mandatory...

239
00:14:20,429 --> 00:14:23,970
and abort all fetuses who have
potential psychopathic genes.

240
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,870
Who agrees with the bill?

241
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:29,740
You may put down your hands.

242
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:31,340
Who disagrees with the bill?

243
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:34,809
They're unbelievable.

244
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:36,980
That's a draw.

245
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,919
So I guess my vote
will be the casting vote.

246
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:49,559
My decision is...

247
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:06,539
Why do you think the murderer
cut off the heads of the victims?

248
00:15:06,809 --> 00:15:09,350
In my opinion, it's the murderer's
strategy to slow down...

249
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:10,879
the victim identification process
as much as possible.

250
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:12,220
For example, taking the victim's
clothes off...

251
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:13,750
Seo Joon, can you come and taste this?

252
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,620
Acts like this
fall into the same category.

253
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:22,690
Why did you make so much food
when your belly is so heavy?

254
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:24,029
There.

255
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,230
I wanted to do my best
since he's a special guest.

256
00:15:34,909 --> 00:15:37,570
By the way, he's been living
in the UK since he was a little boy.

257
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,610
I wonder if he likes Korean food.

258
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:42,149
Daniel.

259
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:50,120
I haven't seen you in a long time.
It's been seven years, right?

260
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,620
- Let's go in now. It's cold out here.
- Okay.

261
00:15:56,529 --> 00:15:57,730
Hello.

262
00:15:58,259 --> 00:15:59,299
It's nice to meet you.

263
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:03,299
It's an honor to meet
such a great person like you.

264
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,299
Without Seo Joon, I wouldn't be
who I am today.

265
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,970
I must repay him for the rest of my life.

266
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:09,940
Come on. That's not true.

267
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,740
I really wanted to attend your wedding.

268
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,309
But I was too busy with my research.

269
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,350
I'm sorry.

270
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:16,779
Don't worry about it.

271
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,080
By the way, I heard you moved
to the UK as a little boy,

272
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,750
but you speak Korean fluently.

273
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:25,820
My stepparents are Koreans, so they
made me speak only Korean at home.

274
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:28,690
Oh, right. Have you found
your younger sibling?

275
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:31,860
Well, I've been trying to,
but haven't succeeded yet.

276
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:36,830
Oh, right. This is from my mother to
congratulate you on your pregnancy.

277
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,399
She didn't have to do this.

278
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:40,100
Thank you so much.

279
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41,870
You must be very hungry.

280
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:45,080
Honey, can you show him around
while I'm preparing dinner?

281
00:16:45,139 --> 00:16:47,110
- I'll do that. Come this way.
- Okay.

282
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,109
What's all this?

283
00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:18,339
Ji Eun is a florist.

284
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:22,049
When we had this house built,
I built this place by myself...

285
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:23,880
as her own place in the house.

286
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:30,319
I'm so relieved that you seem happy.

287
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,160
This is the best Korean food
I've ever tried.

288
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,700
You're such a good cook.

289
00:17:42,769 --> 00:17:44,839
I'm glad you like my food.

290
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:47,400
- Please try this too.
- Okay.

291
00:17:53,009 --> 00:17:55,549
By the way, your house is so lovely.

292
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:58,079
It looks like a house in a fairy tale.

293
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:02,220
Seo Joon designed this house
and built it brick by brick.

294
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:05,819
Her dream was to live
in a suburban house like this.

295
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,630
Oh, right. Can I open the present now?

296
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:09,730
Sure. Go ahead.

297
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:18,900
My mother made it by herself.

298
00:18:19,869 --> 00:18:22,309
She adored Seo Joon more than me.

299
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:28,150
Oh, Seo Joon told me your baby's
fetal nickname is Blessing.

300
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:30,579
I told my mother that,
and she embroidered the name on it.

301
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,049
How thoughtful.

302
00:18:33,349 --> 00:18:34,890
Thank you so much.

303
00:18:35,349 --> 00:18:37,650
Please tell her that we're grateful
and will treasure this.

304
00:18:38,059 --> 00:18:39,490
Sure. I'll tell her that.

305
00:18:41,089 --> 00:18:42,089
It's so cute.

306
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,400
Hey, by the way, what brings you to Korea?

307
00:18:55,369 --> 00:18:56,740
Drive carefully.

308
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:59,180
It seemed like it'd stop snowing
soon when we left.

309
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:01,079
- Right?
- What's wrong?

310
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,910
Oh, gosh.

311
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,779
Why does it keep causing me trouble?

312
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,589
Gosh. No wonder Young Shik that punk
lent me this vehicle for free.

313
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:13,589
You should've borrowed a sedan.
You call this a camper? It's a bus.

314
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,259
I'm embarrassed. Right?

315
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:19,200
Young Shik put a lot of effort
to turned this into a camper.

316
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:21,000
Of course, you say that.

317
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:22,630
Oh, man. What should I do?

318
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,500
It's working now.

319
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,809
All right. Let's go.

320
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,380
So? How did it go?

321
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,019
The president got furious.

322
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:47,289
Why did you vote against it?

323
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:48,930
Don't tell me...

324
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:52,799
that you let the opposition party
change your mind.

325
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:00,869
I adjourned the meeting for a while.

326
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:03,710
And I got a call from my wife
during that time.

327
00:20:04,309 --> 00:20:05,680
She told me that she was pregnant.

328
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,180
My wife and I desperately wanted
a baby for 10 years.

329
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,019
If I were in that situation,

330
00:20:17,019 --> 00:20:20,490
I would never give up on my baby.

331
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:25,730
Congratulations.

332
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:30,000
- Congratulate your wife for me too.
- Thank you.

333
00:20:30,069 --> 00:20:31,740
But don't forget...

334
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:34,099
that you took the right to live...

335
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,309
in a world without wars and crimes...

336
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:40,710
from your unborn baby.

Rejected?

338
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,349
Daniel, what's your stance on it?

339
00:20:49,089 --> 00:20:52,619
I'm just a researcher.
I'm not on either side.

340
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:54,829
What's your opinion?

341
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:57,559
Of course, I'm in favor of the idea.

342
00:20:58,099 --> 00:20:59,930
I hope there will be
no such horrible criminals...

343
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,869
in the world that my baby will live in.

344
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:08,109
Honey, you look tired.
Why don't you go to bed now?

345
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,609
- Me?
- Right.

346
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:12,109
I'll catch up with Seo Joon
just a little longer and leave.

347
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:15,950
I'm fine. Since I got pregnant
at a late age,

348
00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:17,480
he must be worried.

349
00:21:17,549 --> 00:21:19,480
You look really tired.
I think you should rest.

350
00:21:19,549 --> 00:21:22,190
But I... I'm really fine.

351
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:25,859
I'm sorry, Mr. Lee. I'll go to rest
a little bit and come back.

352
00:21:26,089 --> 00:21:27,319
- Rest up.
- Okay.

353
00:22:18,309 --> 00:22:20,109
You're incredible.
You even won a Nobel Prize too.

354
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,049
You made your dream come true in the end.

355
00:22:22,109 --> 00:22:24,720
Stop it. I'm just a nominee yet.

caught yet, right?

What?

359

No.

Seven years have passed, you know.

361
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,500
I'm sorry.

362
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:49,539
Why would you apologize?

363
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,509
Listen. It broke my heart...

364
00:22:53,579 --> 00:22:56,579
to see you suffering
after what happened to Jennifer.

365

I was so happy for you
when I heard about your marriage.

Jennifer must be happy for you too.

Thank you for saying that.

370
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:29,480
Thank you for driving me here.
You should go home now.

371

Sorry, I can't see you off at
the airport because of the surgery.

When Blessing is born, I'll go to
the UK to see you with my family.

373

Sounds great. My mother will be happy too.

Did I take a wrong turn?

Aren't you sleepy, Mu Won?

I am, a bit.

Are we here?

00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:11,269

Young Shik said I didn't have to.

- Come here.

It's snowing so hard.

Mu Won, are you wearing gloves?

- Yes.
- I'm at the camping ground to fish smelt.

What? Okay.

397

Because of the heavy snow,
part of the ceiling caved in.

So they've been closed since yesterday.

We can stay here if we want.
They won't charge us.

401
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:47,039
But they locked the water tank,

402
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,849
- so we must get our own water.
- Forget it. We're leaving.

Yes. Even if we leave now,
we'll reach home around dawn.

488
00:33:56,369 --> 00:33:57,640
No, Mu Chi!

489
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,180
Mom!

490
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:09,389
Come here.

491
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:13,389
Be quiet.

492
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:51,429
Mu Chi...

493
00:34:51,789 --> 00:34:53,159
Be quiet...

494
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:09,750
What should I do?

495
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:30,530
Mu Chi.

496
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:19,880
Go Mu Won. Look into Mom's eyes.

497
00:37:20,409 --> 00:37:22,849
A big brother must look after
his younger brother.

498
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:24,710
Promise Mom.

499
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:23,139
(Police)

500
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:25,909
(Management Office)

501
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:29,150
Over there!

502
00:38:41,059 --> 00:38:46,000
(Byzantine Wedding)

503
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:13,460
- What happened?
- Why are you here? You shouldn't...

504
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:15,059
- get involved.
- I said, what happened?

505
00:39:19,059 --> 00:39:21,260
The owner of the campsite called.

506
00:39:21,329 --> 00:39:25,030
He had found them on his way
to unlock the water tank.

507
00:39:25,099 --> 00:39:27,139
The husband was killed at a nearby spring.

508
00:39:27,369 --> 00:39:29,139
The wife was killed at the campsite.

509
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,639
But there were no bodies.

510
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:35,639
- What about the kids?
- The first son is in surgery.

511
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:36,550
He's in a critical state.

512
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:38,210
The younger son is over there.

513
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:44,789
He must've witnessed his brother
and mom get attacked.

514
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:46,190
He doesn't look too good.

515
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:57,769
Hey, kid.

516
00:39:58,929 --> 00:40:00,500
Did you get to see the killer's face?

517
00:40:02,369 --> 00:40:03,409
Did you?

518
00:40:09,409 --> 00:40:12,679
Come to your senses! Did you see it?

519
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:14,380
That's enough. He almost got killed.

520
00:40:14,449 --> 00:40:15,889
Okay.

521
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,059
Kid.

522
00:40:27,829 --> 00:40:30,829
I need to catch that killer at all costs.

523
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:36,269
He took my daughter.

524
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,980
I don't even know
if she's still alive or not.

525
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:46,719
So...

526
00:40:48,349 --> 00:40:49,489
try to remember.

527
00:40:51,019 --> 00:40:52,389
Did you see the killer's face?

528
00:40:57,630 --> 00:41:00,030
Answer me! Did you or did you not?

529
00:41:00,099 --> 00:41:01,429
What are you doing?

530
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,869
- Please take him away right now!
- Come on.

531
00:41:03,099 --> 00:41:04,429
- Take him away.
- Hey.

532
00:41:04,969 --> 00:41:05,900
Let me go!

533
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,369
- I'm sorry. Are you okay?
- Hey.

534
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:09,340
If you didn't see his face,

535
00:41:10,139 --> 00:41:12,369
how big or tall was he?

536
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,179
Say something, will you?

537
00:41:15,849 --> 00:41:17,250
- Let me go!
- Hold him!

538
00:41:17,409 --> 00:41:18,710
- Hey.
- Hey!

539
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:21,449
Let me go. I said, let go, you scumbags!

540
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:22,989
That's enough.

541
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:25,219
Let go of me.

542
00:41:27,219 --> 00:41:28,860
Do you remember?

543
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:36,130
Are you okay?

544
00:41:39,869 --> 00:41:42,710
It's... It's that person.

545
00:41:42,769 --> 00:41:44,170
That man looks just like him.

546
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,719
When did he clean up?

547
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:34,659
He's never lazy.

548
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:50,710
You're up. Did you sleep well?

549
00:42:50,969 --> 00:42:54,440
You should've woken me up.
I couldn't even say goodbye to him.

550
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:55,639
Did he leave safely?

551
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:57,750
Yes, I dropped him off at the hotel.

552
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:01,849
- Would you like some tea?
- Sure.

553
00:43:15,829 --> 00:43:17,170
All right.

554
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:20,440
Bach's music is the best prenatal music.

555
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:32,449
What would I have done?

556
00:43:33,349 --> 00:43:34,420
What do you mean?

557
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:38,820
If my baby had psychopath genes.

558
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:42,260
My gosh. Don't say
such a terrifying thing.

559
00:43:43,429 --> 00:43:44,590
I'm just wondering...

560
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:48,760
how the mother would feel
when she finds out...

561
00:43:50,329 --> 00:43:52,300
that her baby will be born
as a psychopath.

562
00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:55,139
Oh, my. You silly lady.

563
00:43:55,570 --> 00:43:57,710
Blessing, cover your ears.

564
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:00,010
Your mom should think and talk
about only positive things now...

565
00:44:00,039 --> 00:44:01,340
for your sake.

566
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:03,449
Your mom is not doing it at all.
Am I right?

567
00:44:04,949 --> 00:44:06,349
I'm sorry, Blessing.

568
00:44:06,579 --> 00:44:08,150
I was wrong.

569
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:11,050
I promise I'll think about
only good things from now on.

570
00:44:14,659 --> 00:44:16,630
What's with the siren at such a late hour?

571
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:18,429
Did an accident happen nearby?

572
00:44:29,269 --> 00:44:30,769
They're stopping in front of our house.

573
00:44:31,369 --> 00:44:32,510
Stay inside.

- Yes, sir!

No, wait. What are you doing now?

What is this about? Answer me!

Calm down. Doctor!

Can we at least get
a search and seizure warrant?

How can we wait until tomorrow morning?

601

Will you take responsibility
if we lose the culprit?

602

Sir, don't you think
you came to a hasty conclusion...

after listening to that kid?

604

There is nothing I can't do right now.

- Honey! Seo Joon!
- Search every corner.

609

Find everything.

- Everyone, go inside!
- Yes, sir!

611

You can't barge into

What on earth is going on?

615

I don't know what's going on.

616

There must be a misunderstanding,
but everything will be fine.

How are you all going to
deal with the consequences?

I won't let this slide.

my friend Lawyer Hwang, right?

Hello?

Lawyer Hwang, this is Sung Ji Eun.

625
00:48:21,969 --> 00:48:23,539
- Gosh. We didn't find anything.
- What's there to find in there?

626
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,139
Why are we even here?

627
00:48:25,239 --> 00:48:26,639
- Gosh.
- We wasted our time again.

628
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:32,510
How many more times must we do this?

629

We couldn't find anything.

630
00:48:38,989 --> 00:48:41,590
I told you we should be more cautious.

631
00:48:41,619 --> 00:48:43,659
We're in trouble now because you
blindly trust what the kid said.

632
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:46,329
Does it make sense that a successful
doctor like him is a murderer?

633
00:49:08,019 --> 00:49:09,150
What was that?

634

- Die!
- Stop it. Gosh.

What's that?

637

- What's this?
- Go Mu Chi, I'll let it slide...

653
00:50:50,449 --> 00:50:52,750
of Dr. Han who turned out to be
Headhunter.

654
00:50:53,389 --> 00:50:55,119
The bodies they found are presumed
to be the couple...

655
00:50:55,159 --> 00:50:56,860
who were murdered at a campsite.

656
00:50:56,889 --> 00:50:58,989
An autopsy is being performed
by the National Forensic Service.

657
00:51:02,199 --> 00:51:04,030
- There he comes.
- They're coming.

658
00:51:04,530 --> 00:51:06,699
- Start filming.
- Please step aside.

659
00:51:06,969 --> 00:51:08,099
Make way.

660
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:10,570
- Watch your head.
- Bring my daughter...

661
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:12,170
- back to life!
- Do you admit to the charges?

662
00:51:12,369 --> 00:51:13,579
I didn't do it.

663
00:51:13,610 --> 00:51:16,849
Why did you hide the victim's
belonging in a snowman?

664
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:18,579
I didn't build that snowman.

665
00:51:19,050 --> 00:51:20,849
I do not even know...

666
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:24,420
how that snowman was built
in front of my house.

667
00:51:25,989 --> 00:51:27,119
We have breaking news.

668
00:51:27,159 --> 00:51:29,889
The court denied
an arrest warrant for Mr. Han,

669
00:51:29,929 --> 00:51:31,929
the primary suspect
of the Headhunter case.

670
00:51:32,159 --> 00:51:35,429
The court denied a warrant
and dismissed the case...

671
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:38,900
due to the lack of credibility
of the witness' testimony.

672
00:52:06,530 --> 00:52:07,829
What are you doing? Hey!

673
00:52:10,429 --> 00:52:12,469
Let go of me! He's the killer.

674
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:15,099
- We shouldn't let him go.
- Please try to be reasonable.

675
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:17,610
Hey, tell the truth. Tell me now!

676
00:52:17,710 --> 00:52:19,670
Where is my daughter, you scum?

677
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:23,309
There will be a consequence.

678
00:52:24,510 --> 00:52:25,750
Where is my daughter?

679
00:52:26,550 --> 00:52:28,880
- Hey. Hey.
- Stop him.

680
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:31,719
She's alive, isn't she?

681
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:35,219
I'm begging you. Please.

682
00:52:37,429 --> 00:52:38,530
Please.

683
00:52:41,929 --> 00:52:43,300
Please!

684
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:50,510
Professor Lee.

685
00:52:52,239 --> 00:52:53,710
Can a psychopath...

686
00:52:54,510 --> 00:52:56,139
love someone?

687
00:52:56,179 --> 00:52:59,309
No. A psychopath is born to love himself,

688
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:01,150
and not anyone else.

689
00:53:04,889 --> 00:53:08,219
Seo Joon genuinely loves you.

690
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:10,059
I know that.

691
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:13,400
- There he comes.
- He's coming out!

692
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:14,800
He's coming out.

693
00:53:14,929 --> 00:53:16,059
There he comes.

694
00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:18,769
(Police Serving People with Sincere)

695
00:53:19,329 --> 00:53:21,369
How did you get that scar on your face?

696
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:23,039
Did the police use violence
to coerce your confession?

697
00:53:23,070 --> 00:53:25,809
- Yes. The detective hit him...
- Stop.

698
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:26,940
Well...

699
00:53:28,739 --> 00:53:30,909
Since the detective is the family
of one of the victims,

700
00:53:30,949 --> 00:53:32,809
he couldn't control his emotion.

701
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,550
I hope the killer gets caught
as soon as possible.

702
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:38,949
I will pray that he finds his daughter.

703
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:41,590
Did you really not make the snowman
that was outside your home?

704
00:53:41,659 --> 00:53:42,989
No, I didn't.

705
00:53:43,730 --> 00:53:46,460
I'll say this again. I really...

706
00:53:46,530 --> 00:53:49,429
don't know how that snowman
appeared outside my house.

707
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:53,670
I sincerely hope that the Headhunter
who did something so dreadful...

708
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:56,610
outside my home is caught...

709
00:53:58,269 --> 00:53:59,269
Ji Eun.

710
00:54:00,210 --> 00:54:01,579
Let him through.

711
00:54:01,909 --> 00:54:03,650
Get out of the way. Move.

712
00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:05,409
Just a moment.

713
00:54:14,090 --> 00:54:15,920
It was hard on you, wasn't it?

714
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:18,289
I explained the misunderstanding.

715
00:54:18,929 --> 00:54:20,030
It was you.

716
00:54:24,099 --> 00:54:26,500
You made that snowman.

717
00:54:28,699 --> 00:54:30,440
- The snowman?
- What?

718
00:54:30,510 --> 00:54:32,739
- The snowman?
- Her story's different.

719
00:54:50,190 --> 00:54:53,360
Blessing. Daddy is making...

720
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:56,000
our family out of snowmen.

721
00:54:56,530 --> 00:54:58,170
Daddy snowman.

722
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:01,300
That's you, Blessing.

723
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:03,570
And that's Mommy.

724
00:55:18,989 --> 00:55:20,860
- This is a scoop.
- Call it in.

725
00:55:24,059 --> 00:55:25,460
What's happening?

726
00:55:25,730 --> 00:55:27,659
Did he make the snowmen?

727
00:55:28,329 --> 00:55:30,769
Does this make sense? What happened?

728
00:55:31,099 --> 00:55:32,530
Darn it.

729
00:55:34,239 --> 00:55:37,210
I'm almost home. Yes, Daniel.

730
00:55:37,409 --> 00:55:38,469
Sleep well.

731
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:53,219
Mister. Do you know where
Oseong Camping Grounds is?

732
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:56,760
Turn left over there and...

733
00:55:56,829 --> 00:55:58,360
drive on for 10 minutes.

734
00:55:58,429 --> 00:56:00,500
Thank you. Drive safely.

735
00:56:14,679 --> 00:56:16,949
It's perfect weather for a hunt.

736
00:56:18,610 --> 00:56:20,219
Get a good photo!

737
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:22,280
Han Seo Joon's the killer?

738
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:28,519
My dear wife really is smart.

739
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:34,400
Why did you marry me?

740
00:56:35,329 --> 00:56:36,659
A psychopath...

741
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,369
can't love anyone but himself.

742
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:42,099
They were born that way from the start.

743
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:45,739
Tell me. Why did you marry me?

744
00:56:47,210 --> 00:56:49,179
Why, if you didn't love me?

745
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:52,579
It was more like...

746
00:56:53,619 --> 00:56:55,480
to reproduce.

747
00:56:58,119 --> 00:56:59,719
I needed offspring.

748
00:57:00,590 --> 00:57:03,360
A junior, just like me.

749
00:57:06,289 --> 00:57:07,630
Hey!

750
00:57:07,699 --> 00:57:08,929
- Arrest him.
- You scumbag!

751
00:57:09,159 --> 00:57:10,429
You crazy punk!

752
00:57:10,570 --> 00:57:12,599
- Arrest him!
- Lock him up!

753
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,199
You monster!

754
00:57:35,989 --> 00:57:37,630
What are you doing? Open up.

755
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:39,090
- Get the key.
- Okay.

756
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:43,969
Open up!

757
00:57:44,199 --> 00:57:45,969
What's taking so long?

758
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,539
Is it not there?

759
00:57:48,039 --> 00:57:49,800
Get the key quick.

760
00:57:56,679 --> 00:57:59,679
Did you do it?

761
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:04,019
Did you kill her?

762
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:09,260
Did you kill my sister?

763
00:58:12,059 --> 00:58:14,929
Were you not robbed at the picnic?

764
00:58:17,070 --> 00:58:19,969
Did you kill her and
make it look like a robbery?

765
00:58:21,469 --> 00:58:22,769
No, right?

766
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:25,940
You didn't, did you?

767
00:58:33,619 --> 00:58:35,980
A human being's life...

768
00:58:36,719 --> 00:58:38,889
is hard to take, isn't it?

769
00:58:41,090 --> 00:58:43,019
Was it 20 odd blows?

770
00:58:43,730 --> 00:58:45,190
I stabbed her that much...

771
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:48,530
and she still ran,
dripping blood everywhere.

772
00:58:49,329 --> 00:58:50,869
It must've hurt so bad.

773
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:53,570
So I yelled.

774
00:58:54,199 --> 00:58:57,309
"Jennifer. If you don't
show yourself right now,"

775
00:58:57,369 --> 00:58:58,909
"I'll run to your home,"

776
00:58:58,969 --> 00:59:01,440
"tear your mom and brother to shreds,"

777
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:03,539
"and pick their flesh off their bones."

778
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:06,510
"The choice is yours."

779
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:09,150
"Show yourself right now,"

780
00:59:09,949 --> 00:59:11,989
"or see your shredded family..."

781
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:14,360
"with your own eyes."

782
00:59:15,690 --> 00:59:16,860
"One..."

783
00:59:19,329 --> 00:59:20,400
"two..."

784
00:59:25,099 --> 00:59:26,869
Before I got to three,

785
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:29,599
she crawled out...

786
00:59:29,670 --> 00:59:32,110
from behind the rocks all bloodied up.

787
00:59:32,170 --> 00:59:34,579
It was such a hilarious sight.

788
00:59:38,179 --> 00:59:39,780
Why on earth did you kill her?

789
00:59:40,110 --> 00:59:42,780
Why, when she loved you so much?

790
00:59:44,349 --> 00:59:46,550
She'd aborted my kid.

791
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:49,159
How dare she, without my permission?

792
00:59:49,889 --> 00:59:53,159
What? "I don't want to have kids"?

793
00:59:53,730 --> 00:59:55,059
How dare she...

794
00:59:55,630 --> 00:59:57,630
get rid of Han Seo Joon junior?

795
01:00:03,039 --> 01:00:04,570
What are you doing?

796
01:00:11,579 --> 01:00:14,420
Even as she was breathing her last,

797
01:00:16,449 --> 01:00:18,119
she told me to keep my word.

798
01:00:18,349 --> 01:00:21,190
She told me not to touch
her mom and brother.

799
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:26,059
The pleading look in her eyes was so sexy.

800
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:27,760
Shut your mouth.

801
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:07,840
A researcher I worked with
in the UK has a lab here.

802
01:01:08,969 --> 01:01:11,539
Do you want them to run the test?

803
01:01:24,849 --> 01:01:29,460
(Do Not Enter)

804
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:41,699
Hello. One minute.

805
01:02:44,929 --> 01:02:48,039
You can go straight down the hall.

806
01:02:53,980 --> 01:02:56,340
- Come inside.
- Okay.

807
01:02:57,780 --> 01:02:59,179
(DNA Analysis Report)

808
01:03:03,849 --> 01:03:05,690
Did the result come out?

809
01:03:19,199 --> 01:03:20,329
Don't tell me...

810
01:03:27,679 --> 01:03:28,809
Are you okay?

811
01:03:29,409 --> 01:03:32,050
Abort the baby. Please.

812
01:03:32,449 --> 01:03:33,809
I'm not a doctor.

813
01:03:33,849 --> 01:03:35,179
Also, I'm afraid it's too late...

814
01:03:35,579 --> 01:03:38,349
- for an abortion.
- Then what should I do?

815
01:03:38,550 --> 01:03:40,119
Should I just give birth to this killer?

816
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:41,289
Your baby might not be a killer.

817
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:43,019
Your tests are 99-percent accurate!

818
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:45,289
Are you telling me to place my bets
on the remaining one percent?

819
01:03:45,329 --> 01:03:47,090
It's Han Seo Joon's baby, for Pete's sake!

820
01:04:00,309 --> 01:04:03,210
Hello? Okay, I'll go down right now.

821
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:04,579
Bye.

822
01:04:11,090 --> 01:04:12,789
Ji Eun, I need to meet someone right now.

823
01:04:13,150 --> 01:04:14,690
I'll be back soon.

824

(DNA Analysis Report)

825
01:05:12,349 --> 01:05:13,849
You got tested, right?

826
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:18,090
I thought so,

827
01:05:18,590 --> 01:05:20,489
seeing how you were pregnant.

828
01:05:22,690 --> 01:05:23,889
Does that mean...

829
01:05:24,860 --> 01:05:28,699
My husband was a researcher in England
and had worked with the professor.

830
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:31,800
He wanted to help out.

831
01:05:33,099 --> 01:05:34,670
I was...

832
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:37,840
six weeks pregnant when I had signed up.

833
01:05:39,239 --> 01:05:41,309
A few days later, the result came out.

834
01:05:42,179 --> 01:05:44,210
My husband said the baby was fine.

835
01:05:45,679 --> 01:05:46,980
He said the baby was normal.

836
01:05:48,349 --> 01:05:49,349
I see.

837
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:51,219
But then,

838
01:05:52,219 --> 01:05:53,920
I found out that he had lied.

839
01:05:57,690 --> 01:05:58,860
This baby...

840
01:05:59,929 --> 01:06:02,099
has the DNA of a psychopath.

841
01:06:06,130 --> 01:06:07,739
He had hidden it from me...

842
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:10,570
because he knew I'd be shocked.

843
01:06:18,110 --> 01:06:19,750
How far along are you?

844
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:21,650
I'm...

845
01:06:22,719 --> 01:06:24,590
in my 23rd week.

846
01:06:27,719 --> 01:06:28,820
Thankfully,

847
01:06:29,889 --> 01:06:31,659
you can still get an abortion.

848
01:06:32,659 --> 01:06:36,329
And then, you can try again.

849
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:38,900
My husband...

850
01:06:40,199 --> 01:06:43,269
died last month due to an accident.

851
01:06:44,969 --> 01:06:46,409
He got hit by a car...

852
01:06:47,110 --> 01:06:49,380
after trying to save a little kid
who ran into the road...

853
01:06:50,780 --> 01:06:52,210
after a ball.

854
01:06:55,219 --> 01:06:58,320
I could've given my life to him.

855
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:01,489
This baby...

856
01:07:03,619 --> 01:07:06,059
is my only link with him.

857
01:07:09,099 --> 01:07:10,800
That's the kind of person he was.

858
01:07:12,429 --> 01:07:15,269
He cared more about others than himself.

859
01:07:15,969 --> 01:07:18,010
He was upright and ethical.

860
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:23,409
There's no way his baby...

861
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:27,449
is a psychopath...

862
01:07:28,550 --> 01:07:30,320
or a killer.

863
01:07:36,059 --> 01:07:37,389
I'm going to have my baby.

864
01:07:42,199 --> 01:07:43,760
And then, I'll prove...

865
01:07:45,570 --> 01:07:47,599
Professor Lee wrong.

866
01:07:51,809 --> 01:07:53,170
What about you?

867
01:08:04,119 --> 01:08:05,389
I wish you the best.

Han Seo Joon, dubbed Headhunter,
is a notorious killer...

869
01:08:46,430 --> 01:08:49,500
who murdered 20 innocent victims
and mutilated their bodies.

870
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:51,199
During the final trial,

871
01:08:51,229 --> 01:08:53,670
he was given the death penalty.

872
01:08:53,869 --> 01:08:57,000
His death penalty has been finalized.

- Me.

How are you preparing for the seminar?

It's going well thanks to you.

Thanks for lending me your lab.

It's my pleasure.
You helped me out a lot back in England.

This parcel is for you.

886

How did they know you were here?

887
01:10:06,270 --> 01:10:07,409
Could they be a die-hard fan?

888

No way.

889
01:10:09,340 --> 01:10:11,380
- I'll leave you to it.
- Okay. Thanks.

890
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:17,220
Who sent me this?

Black snakes eat frogs,
sparrows, and mice.

why are you scratching yourself?

895
01:12:25,409 --> 01:12:27,380
Stop drawing and go to the nurse's...

896
01:12:52,539 --> 01:12:53,569
Teacher.

897
01:12:54,310 --> 01:12:55,079
Teacher.

898
01:12:56,010 --> 01:12:57,239
Well...

899
01:12:57,909 --> 01:12:59,180
The rabbit is...

900
01:13:03,180 --> 01:13:05,090
Why did you kill the rabbit?

901
01:13:06,220 --> 01:13:08,020
I didn't mean to kill it.

902
01:13:09,020 --> 01:13:11,090
Why did you cut open its stomach?

903
01:13:11,630 --> 01:13:12,829
Because it was fat.

904
01:13:13,460 --> 01:13:14,699
What did you say?

905
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,869
I wanted to see...

906
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:20,369
if it was fat or pregnant.

907
01:13:21,569 --> 01:13:22,640
What?

908
01:13:22,939 --> 01:13:26,510
You wanted to find that out, so you...

909
01:13:29,380 --> 01:13:32,250
Why do you keep scratching your arm?

910
01:13:33,380 --> 01:13:35,279
The kids annoy me,

911
01:13:35,850 --> 01:13:37,680
but I can't hurt them.

912
01:13:38,220 --> 01:13:39,689
So I take it out on myself.

913
01:13:40,850 --> 01:13:42,489
There are no other kids right now.

914
01:13:46,729 --> 01:13:48,460
You're annoying me now.

915
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:51,430
You're giving me a weird look.

916
01:13:52,670 --> 01:13:53,729
I am?

917
01:13:59,539 --> 01:14:01,680
Okay, then. You can go.

918
01:14:30,439 --> 01:14:32,270
- He's weird.
- What's wrong with him?

919
01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:33,840
He's freaky.

920
01:14:35,109 --> 01:14:36,180
He's not right.

921
01:14:38,609 --> 01:14:41,850
His mom's busy with the store,
so I came instead.

922
01:14:44,550 --> 01:14:47,789
You know that Jae Hoon
wants to be a doctor, right?

923
01:14:48,090 --> 01:14:49,789
Yes. Apparently.

924
01:14:50,090 --> 01:14:52,630
We had the kids
take an IQ test last month.

925
01:14:52,689 --> 01:14:54,130
His IQ is over 160.

926
01:14:54,359 --> 01:14:55,500
Oh, I see.

927
01:14:58,470 --> 01:15:01,000
So, at home,

928
01:15:01,300 --> 01:15:03,069
are there any problems?

929
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:06,210
Pardon? Like what?

930
01:15:22,689 --> 01:15:24,220
Your son drew those.

931
01:15:24,859 --> 01:15:27,560
I asked to see you because
I think he needs urgent therapy.

932
01:15:28,430 --> 01:15:29,460
What therapy?

933
01:15:30,260 --> 01:15:32,170
Just because he draws weird stuff,

934
01:15:32,229 --> 01:15:35,800
are you treating him like a nutcase?

935
01:15:45,609 --> 01:15:48,180
Did you really cut open...

936
01:15:49,149 --> 01:15:50,180
the rabbit?

937
01:16:01,729 --> 01:16:04,300
Honey. Come home immediately.

938
01:16:04,930 --> 01:16:07,569
What? The store's not important right now.

939
01:16:08,270 --> 01:16:10,300
Do you know what your kid did?

940
01:16:11,239 --> 01:16:13,170
It was so humiliating.

941
01:16:18,010 --> 01:16:20,109
Let's eat.

942
01:16:27,850 --> 01:16:30,489
Choco. You cute little thing.

943
01:17:02,590 --> 01:17:03,960
What is that, Jae Hoon?

944
01:17:04,590 --> 01:17:05,729
It's ammonia.

945
01:17:05,859 --> 01:17:08,229
If you pour this in, it kills the fish.

946
01:17:08,630 --> 01:17:09,729
It kills them?

947
01:17:10,260 --> 01:17:12,829
Don't. Don't kill the fish.

948
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:14,199
Move.

949
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:18,810
Dad loves them a lot.

950
01:17:20,609 --> 01:17:22,079
That's why I'm killing them.

951
01:17:22,510 --> 01:17:24,949
Jae Hoon, don't do that.

952
01:17:25,609 --> 01:17:27,880
I feel sorry for the fish.

953
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:44,399
Don't tell Dad that I took Choco.

954
01:17:45,069 --> 01:17:46,500
And about the fish.

955
01:17:47,029 --> 01:17:50,670
Tattling is the worst thing in the world.

956
01:17:52,039 --> 01:17:53,109
Okay?

957
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:10,189
Jae Min, Jae Hee. Dad's home.

958
01:18:11,390 --> 01:18:12,460
Hi.

959
01:18:19,369 --> 01:18:20,369
What happened?

960
01:18:22,239 --> 01:18:24,699
What did you do? Tell me.

961
01:18:31,609 --> 01:18:34,750
Jae Min, you're a good boy.
Why are all the fish dead?

962
01:18:36,850 --> 01:18:38,590
What is that, Jae Hoon?

963
01:18:39,289 --> 01:18:40,520
It's ammonia.

964
01:18:40,649 --> 01:18:41,960
If you pour this in,

965
01:18:42,060 --> 01:18:45,159
it kills the fish.

966
01:18:46,229 --> 01:18:49,329
Don't. Don't kill the fish.

967
01:18:49,659 --> 01:18:52,270
Dad loves them a lot.

968
01:18:52,399 --> 01:18:55,039
That's why I'm killing them.

969
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:06,880
How dare you...

970
01:19:10,550 --> 01:19:11,619
What's that?

971
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,100
Darn it.

972
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:31,300
You fool. You nasty punk.

973
01:19:31,609 --> 01:19:33,539
Get up right now!

974
01:19:34,170 --> 01:19:35,779
Let go of me.

975
01:19:37,439 --> 01:19:38,949
Move.

976
01:20:10,310 --> 01:20:11,750
Shall we go and see Choco?

977
01:20:13,010 --> 01:20:14,149
Choco?

978
01:20:18,449 --> 01:20:20,489
You didn't get to say goodbye.

979
01:20:32,430 --> 01:20:33,729
Choco.

980
01:20:35,470 --> 01:20:37,000
Close your eyes and pray.

981
01:20:37,970 --> 01:20:39,640
Pray that he goes to paradise.

982
01:20:50,250 --> 01:20:51,750
I said it's bad to tattle.

983
01:20:52,449 --> 01:20:54,960
I didn't say anything.

984
01:20:55,489 --> 01:20:58,430
I didn't tell Dad.

985
01:20:58,489 --> 01:21:00,260
You lie too.

986
01:21:01,090 --> 01:21:02,500
You need to learn a lesson.

987
01:21:26,550 --> 01:21:27,850
Go home.

988
01:21:33,630 --> 01:21:35,659
Die. Just die.

989
01:21:36,399 --> 01:21:39,000
You need to die. You're a monster.

990
01:21:41,470 --> 01:21:42,939
I shouldn't have had you.

991
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:46,770
I shouldn't have given birth to you.

992
01:21:53,710 --> 01:21:54,750
Monster.

993
01:22:05,359 --> 01:22:07,090
Do you think...

994
01:22:08,090 --> 01:22:09,699
I look different too?

995
01:22:12,699 --> 01:22:14,569
I was different from the start.

996
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:19,640
I was born different from the beginning.

997
01:22:26,779 --> 01:22:28,079
I was...

998
01:22:29,649 --> 01:22:31,350
born a monster.

999
01:22:41,930 --> 01:22:43,060
That day,

1000
01:22:44,159 --> 01:22:45,729
I prayed to the higher being.

1001
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:48,800
I prayed...

1002
01:22:49,770 --> 01:22:51,710
that I wouldn't become a monster.

1003
01:22:54,810 --> 01:22:57,079
Early this morning, a female
college student's body...

1004
01:22:57,140 --> 01:22:58,880
was found in a vineyard
in Gyeonggi Province.

1005
01:22:58,909 --> 01:23:00,109
(15 years later, present time)

1006
01:23:00,149 --> 01:23:02,649
On the fifth, as Ms. A didn't
come back home from a walk,

1007
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:04,880
her family reported her missing
to the police.

1008
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:08,050
But she was found dead in the end.
Her family is in great sorrow.

1009
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:11,689
The police concluded that this case
is a serial murder case,

1010
01:23:11,729 --> 01:23:13,229
and decided to expand the investigation.

1011
01:23:16,359 --> 01:23:18,159
(Forsythia Daycare Center Fall Picnic)

1012
01:23:19,130 --> 01:23:20,470
The higher being...

1013
01:23:21,470 --> 01:23:23,600
never answered my prayers.

1014
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:26,869
I ended up...

1015
01:23:28,409 --> 01:23:29,909
becoming a murderer.

1016
01:24:34,439 --> 01:24:36,909
(Mouse)

1017
01:24:37,180 --> 01:24:38,949
- Hello.
- He has a good heart,

1018
01:24:38,979 --> 01:24:40,149
and a handsome face.

1019
01:24:40,180 --> 01:24:41,479
He's polite.

1020
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:45,949
And you heard that he even won
a good citizen award too.

1021
01:24:45,989 --> 01:24:47,920
- Ma'am, please. I can't...
- Come on in and take a shower.

1022
01:24:47,949 --> 01:24:49,119
Just come in and take a shower.

1023
01:24:49,159 --> 01:24:50,960
I'll be arrested. Do you understand?

1024
01:24:50,989 --> 01:24:52,560
I mean, she's only 18.

1025
01:24:52,590 --> 01:24:53,829
Eo Beong Yi, wait.

1026
01:24:53,989 --> 01:24:56,399
Or else, I'll rip off your tongue.

1027
01:24:56,430 --> 01:24:59,529
My name is Oh Bong Yi,
not Eo Beong Yi. Oh Bong Yi.

1028
01:24:59,569 --> 01:25:00,899
I'll finish it quickly.

1029
01:25:00,930 --> 01:25:02,039
Have you been drinking?

1030
01:25:02,699 --> 01:25:05,140
You must have lost your mind.
Gosh, you're a police officer!

1031
01:25:05,170 --> 01:25:08,039
You're right. I'm insane.
I'm totally insane.

1032
01:25:08,170 --> 01:25:11,210
If you jump, all the intestines
in your body will pop out.

1033
01:25:11,239 --> 01:25:12,449
Your body will just pop.

1034
01:25:14,510 --> 01:25:15,750
Did he actually jump?

1035
01:25:15,779 --> 01:25:17,050
Move!

1036
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:18,720
What must I apologize for?

1037
01:25:18,750 --> 01:25:19,989
- You little...
- Stop.

1038
01:25:20,319 --> 01:25:21,449
Don't do that.

1039
01:25:22,189 --> 01:25:24,689
You know that I never let go
like a pit bull terrier.

1040
01:25:26,130 --> 01:25:27,159
Get lost.

1041
01:25:28,289 --> 01:25:29,829
The fact that the killer took souvenirs...

1042
01:25:29,930 --> 01:25:33,329
indicates that the killer of the two
cases is a dangerous psychopath.

1043
01:25:33,369 --> 01:25:35,500
You will fail in the end.

1044
01:25:35,539 --> 01:25:37,470
- What?
- You can't kill a person.

1045
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:38,470
"Hunting"?

1046
01:25:38,510 --> 01:25:41,170
He may be hunting someone else
as we speak now.

1047
01:25:41,369 --> 01:25:42,609
(Repentance, Redemption)

1048
01:25:45,680 --> 01:25:48,750
There's neither a church nor a cross.

1049
01:25:49,119 --> 01:25:50,649
There's no sign of moving the body either.

1050
01:25:54,949 --> 01:25:57,119
That's him. He's Headhunter.

1051
01:25:57,390 --> 01:25:59,729
That means there's a monster
inside of him.
