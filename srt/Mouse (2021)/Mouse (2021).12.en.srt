(The animal scenes are CGI.)

9
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,500
There's a reason...

10
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:33,170
I take this route when there's a shortcut.

11
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:36,409
No one takes this path.

12
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,210
There's no one to disturb me.

13
00:00:39,909 --> 00:00:41,609
- I enjoy the time alone.
- Help me.

14
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:43,619
Please help me.

15
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:47,049
Please... Help me.

16
00:01:05,769 --> 00:01:07,239
There,

17
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,769
Help me.

18
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,510
I saw a child dying.

19
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,109
Save me.

20
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:21,819
I got annoyed.

21
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,390
I was distracted from
the game I was playing.

22
00:01:28,659 --> 00:01:30,530
News about that kid...

23
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:33,099
is on TV all evening.

24
00:01:34,269 --> 00:01:36,299
People are crying as they watch.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,500
Why on earth are they crying?

26
00:01:42,109 --> 00:01:47,250
(Mouse)

27
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,230
(Episode 12)

28
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,430
You were right.

29
00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:38,030
That if I don't accept it,

30
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:42,430
I'll end up killing my family
and those I love.

31
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,000
So? How do you feel?

32
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:48,139
Tortured?

33
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,409
It was exhilarating.

34
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:56,550
I feel refreshed.

35
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:01,150
I felt out of sorts,
and that feeling has gone now.

36
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,259
Detective Go.

37
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:09,560
Mu Chi, what took you so long?

38
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:11,300
At the hospital...

39
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,750
(Mom)

40
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:17,100
Such touching motherly love.

41
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:44,819
A woman in her 70s
was found hanging from a tree...

42
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,759
in Inho Park at around10pm tonight.

43
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:50,730
Many bruises were found on her body.

44
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:54,899
A handwritten letter was found
at the scene,

45
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,129
and the police are currently
identifying the body.

46
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,870
("Woman in Her 70s
Presumably Committed Suicide")

47
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:03,569
That's when I knew...

48
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,009
that Kang Deok Soo's mother...

49
00:05:06,709 --> 00:05:09,350
had written that dying letter...

50
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:14,490
and that she had given me
a resentful gaze.

51
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,790
Back then, it was too hectic to notice.

52
00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:19,560
Then I thought to myself.

53
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,889
"Why did she try to kill her own son?"

54
00:05:22,529 --> 00:05:26,160
That was her last resort
to stop her son from committing...

55
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:29,199
another crime.

56
00:05:29,569 --> 00:05:32,069
Those with psychopath genes this pure...

57
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,569
will commit the same crime at all costs.

58
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:37,879
Bong Yi.

59
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,629
Yu Na...

60
00:07:03,829 --> 00:07:06,560
Please... Please spare me.

61
00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:10,329
Please... Please spare me.

62
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,199
Please...

63
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:17,680
Someone, help!

65
00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:33,660
(Image 20)

66
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,319
- What's that?
- What?

67
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:09,930
We didn't touch anything yet
because forensics hasn't come.

68
00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:11,660
Mu Chi.

69
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,569
Hoon Seok, get up. Hurry.

70
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:22,240
Mom.

71
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:25,240
How could you come here
without telling me?

72
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:27,410
Don't you know
I've been looking everywhere for you?

73
00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:30,779
Aunt, he did nothing wrong.
I brought him here.

74
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,279
You had left your phone,

75
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,950
so I left a note on your fridge.
I guess you missed it.

76
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:36,090
I'm sorry.

77
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:37,289
- Let's go.
- Aunt.

78
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:42,330
Hoon Seok. Hoon Seok, I'm sorry.

79
00:08:45,629 --> 00:08:46,860
Hurry up.

80
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:50,669
Aunt, I'm sorry.

81
00:08:59,809 --> 00:09:02,909
This is driving me insane.

82
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:05,519
I truly don't remember.

83
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,549
I lied.

84
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,549
I wasn't drunk.

85
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,190
Please spare me. I'll never...

86
00:09:12,059 --> 00:09:14,230
I'll never do it again. Please...

87
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,759
You'll have no more chances anyway.

88
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:29,740
Bong Yi's grandmother waited ten years
for your release...

89
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,809
as she honed this knife.

90
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:34,350
If you die so soon, it'll be no fun.

91
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,620
That's why I pulled out
some of your teeth.

92
00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:40,590
I'm not a complete lowlife.

93
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,450
If I'm proven guilty, you may as well...

94
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:44,860
castrate me.

95
00:09:53,929 --> 00:09:56,429
"If anyone injures his neighbor,"

96
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,169
"whatever he has done
must be done to him."

97
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:02,740
Atonement.

98
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:05,710
"An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth."

99
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:09,149
Why am I reminded of that case?

100
00:10:16,789 --> 00:10:18,419
He's a psychopath.

101
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,009
Another psychopath like Sung Yo Han
has appeared.

102
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:59,000
Have some. You must be hungry.

103
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:11,309
Once you come to your senses,

104
00:11:11,809 --> 00:11:13,809
an immense amount of guilt
will consume you.

105
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:17,149
It will be extremely excruciating.

106
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:19,519
I'm sorry.

107
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,620
I'm truly sorry.

108
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,100
Kang Deok Soo has been murdered.

109
00:12:12,169 --> 00:12:14,909
At the crime scene of the incident
that happened 12 years ago,

110
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,980
he was found with his body parts severed.

111
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:27,690
Gosh. How could he do this to a kid?

112
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:30,350
A child in her neighborhood was
his target.

113
00:12:31,389 --> 00:12:35,059
The kid said that Bong Yi tried
to stop him from taking her away...

114
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,899
You should've stayed by Bong Yi's side
if you wanted to protect her.

115
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,500
Instead of chasing after Kang Deok Soo.

116
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:45,639
- Please forget about Han Seo Joon...
- Who are you to tell me what to do?

117
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:51,509
- It's not that I don't know how you feel.
- Do you?

118
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,909
You think you know how I feel?

119
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,299
I'm sorry I missed your call.

120
00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:18,039
I didn't hear the phone ring.

121
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,440
Did you see Bong Yi?

122
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:23,710
Not yet.

123
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,710
You'll be upset when you see her.

124
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:45,330
What's wrong?

125
00:13:50,669 --> 00:13:51,799
I don't know.

126
00:13:54,669 --> 00:13:55,809
I just felt...

127
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,710
What are you pondering on?

128
00:13:58,740 --> 00:13:59,879
What is it?

129
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,009
I feel sad.

130
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:05,549
The sunlight pouring through those leaves
makes me sad.

131
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,350
I'll get going now.

132
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,730
The kid said...

133
00:14:22,899 --> 00:14:25,700
that Bong Yi tried to stop him
from taking her away...

134
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,240
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

135
00:14:45,659 --> 00:14:46,919
Gosh. You startled me.

136
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,960
I'll stay with her. You can go now.

137
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:52,259
All right.

138
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,529
Okay. Let go of me.

139
00:14:56,169 --> 00:14:57,600
I said, let go. Gosh.

140
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:15,120
Gosh, that brat is so strong like Hulk.

141
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,860
Could he be jealous of me?

142
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,330
That punk.

143
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:31,070
- Yes, sir.
- Where are you? Come back now.

144
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:34,309
It has been found that the person
who reported to the police...

145
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:37,169
and got seriously injured while fighting
with Kang Deok Soo to save the child...

146
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,409
was the child victim of the crime
committed by Kang Deok Soo 12 years ago.

147
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,750
As the complacent action of the police
after receiving the report was revealed,

148
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:45,049
which stirred up controversy,

149
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,279
the police decided to put together
a special task force...

150
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:50,149
considering the seriousness of the case.

151
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,289
This is terrifying.

152
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,529
No wonder why her baby seems unusual.

153
00:16:00,129 --> 00:16:03,100
The baby won't stop crying
once the crying starts.

154
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,470
Ms. Choi, you're home.

155
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:12,539
Yes. I'll look after my baby.
You can go home to rest.

156
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,909
What? Oh, okay then.

157
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,519
I'm sorry.

158
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,919
I'm sorry, my baby.

159
00:16:34,529 --> 00:16:35,629
Thanks.

160
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:38,370
Unbelievable.

161
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:42,210
You gave him the key to get him fired.

162
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:45,539
And you just took the key and fled.

163
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:49,649
As the leader of the special task force,

164
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:51,250
you should've brought me here.

165
00:16:51,379 --> 00:16:54,919
You brought these two
and even Detective Lee, but not me.

166
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:56,049
That hurts.

167
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,460
Hey, if Kang Deok Soo's mother hadn't
brought us this statement,

168
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:00,519
you wouldn't have been just fired.

169
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:01,990
You should've gone to prison, you punk.

170
00:17:03,659 --> 00:17:05,960
I guess she hanged herself
right after bringing this to the station.

171
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:09,369
She seemed to have hurt her leg
and had some bruises.

172
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:11,099
I think Kang Deok Soo hit her.

173
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,900
How could he beat his mother?
He must've been a total lunatic.

174
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:16,240
Exactly, Golden Boy.
You should've brought this right away.

175
00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:18,440
Why did you deliver it too late
and make things complicated?

176
00:17:18,509 --> 00:17:20,880
I didn't. I gave it to Detective Lee
right after I received it.

177
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,150
That punk didn't deliver it
to Inspector Bok right away.

178
00:17:23,549 --> 00:17:25,180
I don't like that punk either.

179
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,349
You should let me join your team.

180
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,819
Based on her will, she must have
committed suicide because she knew...

181
00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:32,220
that he was after that kid.

182
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:35,259
She must've thought that he would stop it
out of guilt...

183
00:17:35,329 --> 00:17:36,930
if he knew that she killed herself
because of him.

184
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:40,059
I'm sure she thought that was the best way
to stop him.

185
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:45,039
But the likes of him never feel guilty.

186
00:17:45,269 --> 00:17:46,500
Aside from that...

187
00:17:46,569 --> 00:17:49,109
What did you do from last night
to this morning? You couldn't be reached.

188
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:50,369
Answer the question clearly.

189
00:17:50,509 --> 00:17:52,980
Or else, you'll be the first suspect
of the murder of Kang Deok Soo.

190
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:54,410
Well...

191
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:03,890
I was mugged.

192
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:07,619
You were mugged?

193
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,500
Bong Yi.

194
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,029
Are you awake?

195
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:22,839
- Don't get up.
- Yu Na. Is she okay?

196
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,980
Don't worry. She didn't get hurt.

197
00:18:25,109 --> 00:18:26,740
She's home with her mother.

198
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:37,250
Where... Where is Mr. Go?

199
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,119
I don't know.

200
00:18:42,029 --> 00:18:43,460
Kang Deok Soo...

201
00:18:44,829 --> 00:18:45,859
He's dead.

202
00:18:52,269 --> 00:18:53,569
Did you know?

203
00:18:55,109 --> 00:18:56,609
What? No.

204
00:18:58,109 --> 00:19:00,079
How would I have known that?
Of course, I just found out.

205
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:06,349
My gosh. I'm telling you the truth.

206
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:07,990
When I woke up, my wallet was gone.

207
00:19:08,049 --> 00:19:09,549
Who would rob anyone like that?

208
00:19:09,789 --> 00:19:12,420
It's not like your car is a luxury car.
It's a junk car.

209
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:15,130
He's right. I mean, the truck didn't chase
and hit your car from behind.

210
00:19:15,289 --> 00:19:17,430
I saw the truck coming toward me
in the heavy rain,

211
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:20,559
and it crossed the center line.
I turned the wheel to the left right away.

212
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:23,299
Then I saw a tree in front of me,
so I turned right.

213
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,069
My car stopped after spinning around
two and a half times.

214
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,099
My gosh. You don't believe me.

215
00:19:27,269 --> 00:19:29,369
Go and check the CCTV footage. Come on.

216
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,910
I need to find my wallet. There's
the only family photo I have left in it.

217
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,509
- All right. Leave now.
- Check it now.

218
00:19:33,579 --> 00:19:35,980
Just leave for now.
And behave yourself for the time being.

219
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,150
Don't forget that you're a suspect now.

220
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:39,420
I, too, wish I were the killer.

221
00:19:39,549 --> 00:19:41,920
I should've killed
that scum Kang Deok Soo myself.

222
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:44,619
But someone else did it.
I greatly regret letting it happen.

223
00:19:55,869 --> 00:19:58,240
Sir, you don't think he did it, do you?

224
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,440
It wasn't him.

225
00:19:59,869 --> 00:20:02,369
He said he killed the man when he didn't.

226
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:05,279
He would never deny it
if he actually killed Kang Deok Soo.

227
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,480
Mu Chi said that the killer was
a psychopath, right?

228
00:20:07,809 --> 00:20:10,180
Yes, he did. He said that the killer was
just like Sung Yo Han.

229
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:14,049
If he's right about that,
he'll probably catch and kill the killer.

230
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:16,349
So we should catch the killer...

231
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:18,259
before Mu Chi does. Understood?

232
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:21,529
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

233
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:24,599
What a jerk. How dare you steal my wallet?

234
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:26,700
That darn thief.

235
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,569
Who would rob anyone like that?

236
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:31,170
It's not like your car is a luxury car.
It's a junk car.

237
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,140
I mean, the truck didn't chase
and hit your car from behind.

238
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:34,940
Exactly.

239
00:20:36,009 --> 00:20:37,269
That's weird.

240
00:20:56,059 --> 00:20:57,289
"O, Z".

241
00:20:58,029 --> 00:21:00,230
Hey, why didn't you deliver
the statement right away?

242
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:02,269
You put me in a difficult position.

243
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,869
- Why didn't you deliver it yourself?
- What?

244
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:07,200
You were too excited
about being on the show to do it.

245
00:21:07,269 --> 00:21:08,470
I can't believe you.

246
00:21:09,069 --> 00:21:10,809
You punk, how could you forget
doing such an important thing?

247
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:13,279
Gosh. Forget it.

248
00:21:37,099 --> 00:21:38,099
Is it an unregistered car?

249
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,970
Darn it. Okay.

250
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:45,579
Then how am I going to find it?
It was the only family photo I had.

251
00:21:54,019 --> 00:21:55,619
I'm glad I still have this one.

00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,339
(Restricted Area)

254
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,910
(Predator Serial Murders 3,
Mujin Police Station)

255
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:58,119
Kang Deok Soo was killed 24 hours ago,

256
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:00,519
and the police have nothing on the killer,

257
00:23:00,549 --> 00:23:04,250
but the public wants
the Special Task Force disbanded.

258
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:07,319
There's even a petition
on Cheong Wa Dae's website...

259
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:10,460
saying his killer should not be punished.

260
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,710
You came in early.

261
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,410
Is something happening outside?

262
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:30,579
The atmosphere's a bit...

263
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:32,180
How do you feel?

264
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:35,319
Oh, I feel much better.

265
00:23:38,859 --> 00:23:40,460
What are you looking at?

266
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:42,289
I need to find Kang Deok Soo's killer.

267
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,799
The whole country seems to wish
he not be caught.

268
00:23:49,299 --> 00:23:52,140
They think there's some kind of
dark hero out there.

269
00:23:52,369 --> 00:23:53,670
Not knowing his identity.

270
00:23:54,539 --> 00:23:55,609
His identity?

271
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:57,069
He's a psychopath.

272
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,339
He's like Sung Yo Han.

273
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:06,079
I need to check a few more things.

274
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,920
Hey, kid, where's your evidence?

275
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,819
The case happened ages ago.

276
00:24:16,259 --> 00:24:19,329
Hey, you went way too far.

277
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:21,430
Would I let you off
because the President's there?

278
00:24:21,569 --> 00:24:23,970
Bring the evidence over... Hello?

279
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,740
He hung up on me?

280
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:30,410
I won't vote for his dad later.

281
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:31,980
Follow me with an empty box.

282
00:24:33,309 --> 00:24:34,339
Okay.

283
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:39,220
Don't you know all evidence should be
sent to the Evidence Storage Team?

284
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:47,589
I apologize.

285
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:49,930
The President's really here?

286
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:51,460
I told you so.

287
00:24:51,829 --> 00:24:53,299
I've never seen him in real life.

288
00:24:53,529 --> 00:24:56,529
He cut his jog short to hear about
the nation's favorite case.

289
00:24:56,569 --> 00:25:00,269
So, these are photos of Kim Yu Na
that was on Kang Deok Soo's phone.

290
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:04,710
Kang Deok Soo started photographing her
the day after he returned to his mother's.

291
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,740
We believe that's when he targeted her...

292
00:25:06,779 --> 00:25:09,049
and planned to go after the girl.

293
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:11,619
- Do you have a suspect?
- Yes, sir.

294
00:25:12,549 --> 00:25:14,680
This is a wound found on
the back of Kang Deok Soo's neck.

295
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,450
It's a mark left by a taser.

296
00:25:16,589 --> 00:25:19,420
If a taser's shock misses
instead of making direct contact,

297
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:22,029
they leave small burn marks such as this.

298
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:24,490
If the taser missed,

299
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,160
it's likely the suspect's a woman.

300
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,500
Yes, that's correct.

301
00:25:28,869 --> 00:25:30,329
On the taser found at the scene,

302
00:25:30,369 --> 00:25:34,099
we lifted the prints of Ms. Oh,
Kang Deok Soo's victim from 12 years ago.

303
00:25:34,269 --> 00:25:37,539
We also have Detective Shin's statement
that he gave Ms. Oh a taser.

304
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:40,779
- We believe it's a revenge murder...
- What are you doing?

305
00:25:41,509 --> 00:25:42,609
A revenge murder?

306
00:25:43,109 --> 00:25:45,680
That's not evidence
directly linked to the murder.

307
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,920
Yu Na said that...

308
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:48,549
Bong Yi fought Kang Deok Soo.

309
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:49,890
That's when he got tasered.

310
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,950
Didn't you see Bong Yi?

311
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:52,559
Was she in any state to kill someone?

312
00:25:52,589 --> 00:25:54,759
- Be quiet, Mu Chi.
- Stop it.

313
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:58,599
Okay, so here, here, and here.

314
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,599
As you can see,
the wounds on Kang Deok Soo's body...

315
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:06,569
seem to be a reenactment of
what Kang Deok Soo...

316
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,140
did to his victim 12 years ago,

317
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:10,339
- and the details match.
- You're barking up the wrong tree.

318
00:26:10,369 --> 00:26:12,480
It's a typical psychopathic murder.

319
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,109
I said be quiet.

320
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,509
A psychopath?

321
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:17,380
What's your proof of that?

322
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:20,349
Oh, I will explain what the proof is.

323
00:26:20,849 --> 00:26:24,589
Look at this wound here.
How do you explain this?

324
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,190
How do you think?

325
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,160
This wound was also...

326
00:26:28,289 --> 00:26:31,029
- identical to one from 12 years ago on...
- Yes.

327
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,430
However, all the other wounds were
inflicted while Kang was still alive,

328
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,269
but this was inflicted postmortem.

329
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,500
This is where an artery is.

330
00:26:38,539 --> 00:26:41,000
A stab here would've
caused a blood-spray and there's none.

331
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,009
He was stabbed here
after the heart stopped.

332
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:44,109
Speak politely.

333
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,740
The killer forgot this wound.

334
00:26:50,049 --> 00:26:51,049
Shoot.

335
00:26:52,619 --> 00:26:55,720
He realized he'd missed it
after the murder and returned.

336
00:26:56,549 --> 00:26:59,819
He came back and inflicted this wound
in the exact spot.

337
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,289
Can you pull up the photos of his thigh?

338
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:05,400
If you see here,
there's a burn mark caused by a lighter.

339
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:07,059
It's from a lighter.

340
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:08,630
Speak politely, Mu Chi.

341
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,099
If you're right,

342
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,529
12 years ago, the female victim...

343
00:27:11,569 --> 00:27:14,670
would've had the same wound
in the same place. Right, sir?

344
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:18,380
But the victim from 12 years ago
wasn't burned.

345
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:19,509
Why not?

346
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:20,940
Why...

347
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:23,549
Why did he do that?

348
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:25,650
I wonder. Why did he do that?

349
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,019
Now, if you look carefully,

350
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:30,789
beneath this burn is a wound.

351
00:27:30,819 --> 00:27:32,690
The killer did this by mistake.

352
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:34,519
This wound wasn't supposed to exist.

353
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:38,059
So he used a lighter to
try to burn it out.

354
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:40,859
As you would use an eraser
to rub out a writing error.

355
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:47,200
Is that enough to conclude
the killer's a psychopath?

356
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,569
The Unabomber, a well-known psychopath...

357
00:27:49,609 --> 00:27:51,240
who mass-murdered
random people with parcels...

358
00:27:51,339 --> 00:27:53,210
sent letters to the police and media,

359
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,809
and any mistake he made,
he scratched them out many times.

360
00:27:55,849 --> 00:27:57,680
Enough to tear through the paper.

361
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,920
It wasn't just about correcting a mistake.

362
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:02,720
It was as if he was trying to
erase the fact he made a mistake.

363
00:28:02,849 --> 00:28:05,890
That kind of psychopath is called
a power-control killer.

364
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,559
Kang Deok Soo's killer...

365
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:10,259
clearly has a kind of obsession...

366
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:12,829
that he must control every detail.

367
00:28:12,859 --> 00:28:14,630
He made this cut by mistake,

368
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,869
and he hastily tried
to erase it with fire.

369
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,970
Kang's previous victim
did not have this wound.

370
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,369
That's why the killer did not want...

371
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,569
this carbon copy to have this flaw.

372
00:28:23,609 --> 00:28:26,109
Now, other than the superficial wounds,

373
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:29,549
there are other internal injuries
like serious fractures.

374
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:31,349
He was assaulted to leave no bruising.

375
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,250
His bones are all broken.

376
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:35,319
Aim for places with no veins.

377
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,119
That way you leave no marks.

378
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:40,490
Kang was castrated while he was alive.

379
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:43,890
All these are sadistic actions
meant to cause...

380
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,829
Kang Deok Soo the most pain, and sadism...

381
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,759
is typical of a psychopathic killer.

382
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,470
Therefore, this is not the killing
of one who wants revenge...

383
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:52,269
but that of a psychopath.

384
00:28:52,299 --> 00:28:54,240
- We must...
- How was the killer...

385
00:28:54,269 --> 00:28:56,470
able to reenact a 12-year-old case?

386
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,839
- Only the victim herself...
- Other than the victim,

387
00:29:00,009 --> 00:29:01,950
the whole nation knows.

388
00:29:02,009 --> 00:29:04,450
The trashy press wanted more clicks,

389
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,250
so they revealed every single
terrible detail of the case.

390
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,349
Without caring at all for the victim!

391
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:11,220
There are details that weren't
released to the press.

392
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:12,519
Inspector Bok.

393
00:29:13,059 --> 00:29:16,230
This mark left by a burning cigarette.

394
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:19,130
This was something
only the investigative team knew.

395
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:21,359
It was a detail no one put online,

396
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:25,029
and it's mentioned only in
the case report that was written by hand.

397
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,069
What's going on?

398
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,069
It could've been an insider.

399
00:29:30,369 --> 00:29:31,470
How dare you...

400
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,579
Where is the handwritten case file now?

401
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:38,980
It's in the Evidence Storage Room
in our building.

402
00:29:39,019 --> 00:29:40,579
Check the file and report to me.

403
00:29:40,819 --> 00:29:42,619
- Yes, sir.
- I have plans for the afternoon.

404
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,859
Are you Candidate Shin's...

405
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:54,660
Yes.

406
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:58,170
I got a call from my wife.
She was pregnant.

407
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:01,269
My wife and I desperately wanted
a baby for ten years.

408
00:30:01,539 --> 00:30:03,710
You have a great father.

409
00:30:03,809 --> 00:30:06,180
I'm sure the apple
didn't fall far from the tree.

410
00:30:06,779 --> 00:30:07,839
Thank you.

411
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,150
You're Officer Jung Ba Reum,
the nation's hero.

412
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,779
Yes, sir. I'm Officer Jung
on the Evidence Storage Team.

413
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,519
It's good to see you healthy and well.

414
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,720
Thank you. I owe it to you.

415
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,289
Even if the victim deserved to die,

416
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,529
murder is still a grave crime.

417
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:28,500
A crime that breaks any law
cannot be justified.

418
00:30:28,769 --> 00:30:30,230
I trust in you.

419
00:30:30,269 --> 00:30:32,970
Find the killer soon
and show the nation that...

420
00:30:33,099 --> 00:30:34,339
the government works.

421
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:45,079
Du Seok, I need to see...

422
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:47,880
surveillance footage from your office.

423
00:30:49,549 --> 00:30:50,650
What's going on?

424
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:57,529
There's not much.

425
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:01,700
An insider? How dare you say that
in the President's presence?

426
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:04,670
Get Oh Bong Yi's debit card statement
and phone records,

427
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:08,299
and figure out her movements from
three nights ago up to Kang's death.

428
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:10,640
What a mess.

429
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:12,410
That wound.

430
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:15,849
Only the detectives
and doctor knew about it.

431
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,980
Was it really Bong Yi?

432
00:31:18,349 --> 00:31:19,619
That can't happen.

433
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:20,980
What if it was her?

434
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:23,390
What if Bong Yi did kill him?

435
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:24,720
Will you sit and do nothing?

436
00:31:24,789 --> 00:31:26,190
Will you let her get arrested?

437
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:29,089
No, I can't. The poor kid... Her life...

438
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:32,029
Then get a move on
before the Task Force Team does.

439
00:31:36,029 --> 00:31:38,029
Don't just stand there. Help him.

440
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,369
I'll sort stuff out here.

441
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,769
Okay.

442
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:47,240
I quit drinking
and have withdrawal symptoms.

443
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:51,809
I owe Bong Yi so much and I wronged her.

444
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:56,349
I felt so guilty that
I decided to quit drinking.

445
00:31:56,819 --> 00:31:58,319
I'll peel it for you.

446
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:03,990
I heard what you told the female officer.

447
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,130
But I'm still curious about something.

448
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,960
May I ask you a few more questions?

449
00:32:09,369 --> 00:32:11,299
- Let me record this.
- Okay.

450
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:18,210
You said you saw a pair of shoes
where you were hiding.

451
00:32:18,809 --> 00:32:20,180
Can you explain?

452
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:26,279
- Please spare me.
- I heard a sound.

453
00:32:47,269 --> 00:32:50,339
I was in a rush, so I went inside.

454
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,990
Someone locked the door?

455
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:05,759
Why didn't you scream?
It could've been Kang Deok Soo.

456
00:33:06,619 --> 00:33:08,160
It wasn't him.

457
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,500
But you didn't even see their face.
How are you so sure?

458
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,500
If it was that bad man,

459
00:33:16,529 --> 00:33:18,200
he would've opened the door
and dragged me outside.

460
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:20,170
They wouldn't have locked it.

461
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:23,210
You're quite smart. Good thinking.

462
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,740
And?

463
00:33:24,809 --> 00:33:27,410
I was too terrified,

464
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,450
so I stayed there.

465
00:33:30,779 --> 00:33:33,250
I don't know how much time had passed by,

466
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,890
but I heard someone unlocking the door.

467
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:42,559
But I was too scared to go out.

468
00:33:56,269 --> 00:33:57,910
A pair of shoes were there?

469
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:02,210
- Let me get a plate.
- No, let me.

470
00:34:03,509 --> 00:34:05,009
Think carefully.

471
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:08,989
By the way...

472
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,619
Is there something you want to say?

473
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:18,190
What? Me?

474
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:21,329
No. I have nothing to say.

475
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:26,139
Mom, I'm sleepy.

476
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:27,239
Okay.

477
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,369
She's tired. We should end this.

478
00:34:29,869 --> 00:34:31,239
I should let her sleep.

479
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:32,679
Okay.

480
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:39,750
- Isn't it strange?
- What?

481
00:34:40,449 --> 00:34:41,780
Oh, yes.

482
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:44,989
It doesn't make sense that a psychopath
protected a kid...

483
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:48,460
and was kind enough
to put her shoes outside.

484
00:34:52,059 --> 00:34:53,829
Could Bong Yi truly have killed him?

485
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,409
Yes?

486
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,480
What?

487
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,449
What's wrong? Detective Go.

488
00:35:12,349 --> 00:35:14,380
Your credit card statement showed
that you had bought a knife,

489
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,719
so we went to the shop to confirm.

490
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:19,460
- According to the owner of the shop...
- What are you doing?

491
00:35:19,889 --> 00:35:22,289
Why are you interrogating
an injured girl? I said it wasn't her.

492
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,889
- Take him outside.
- Hey.

493
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,699
Bong Yi, it wasn't you. Tell them so.

494
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,070
You didn't kill him. Bong Yi.

495
00:35:29,099 --> 00:35:30,869
- You should leave.
- Bong Yi.

496
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,469
You...

497
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:39,340
Why isn't Bong Yi denying it?

498
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,179
Why isn't she saying anything?

499
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:44,679
- Sir.
- I think it was her.

500
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:47,820
What?

501
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:52,019
She could've left some evidence behind,
so let's find and get rid of them.

502
00:35:52,289 --> 00:35:54,059
It'll be game over
once she confesses to it, so let's hurry.

503
00:35:54,289 --> 00:35:55,489
Why?

504
00:35:56,829 --> 00:35:59,599
- What?
- Why are you going this far for her?

505
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,659
She's not even your sister.

506
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:11,010
Had you been in my shoes,
you would've done the same thing.

507
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,440
Bong Yi has gone through so much.

508
00:36:13,739 --> 00:36:15,380
She even lost her grandmother.

509
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:18,179
She deserves to be happy.

510
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:22,550
Even if she confesses to killing him,
I support her all the way.

511
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:27,489
If you don't want to,
then you don't need to do it.

512
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:32,059
No. I'll join you.

513
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:36,699
I'll meet with the one who made the call.
You should meet with Hong Ju.

514
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,599
Sound her out without her noticing.

515
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:44,010
It was around midnight.
I had a drink with a friend...

516
00:36:44,139 --> 00:36:45,780
and was going home.

517
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:48,710
I called you several times,
but you never picked up.

518
00:36:48,809 --> 00:36:51,949
Detective Go was in jail,
so I knew he couldn't pick up.

519
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:55,320
I went to Bong Yi's, but she wasn't there.
I was looking for her...

520
00:36:55,449 --> 00:36:57,019
and even went under the bridge to check.

521
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:00,159
I found her there and took her
to the hospital.

522
00:37:03,059 --> 00:37:05,059
I was about to cross the bridge...

523
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:08,500
when a car with no headlights
raced toward me.

524
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:11,329
While trying to dodge,
my bicycle rolled down the bridge.

525
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:14,269
Hey! Drive properly, will you?

526
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:27,019
Something felt off,

527
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,489
so I revisited the area at dawn.

528
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:37,489
Did you see anything else?

529
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:40,900
No.

530
00:37:42,929 --> 00:37:44,030
Okay.

531
00:37:58,449 --> 00:38:00,849
I don't know how much time had passed by,

532
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:03,320
but I heard someone unlocking the door.

533
00:38:04,889 --> 00:38:07,260
It doesn't make sense that a psychopath
protected a kid...

534
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,260
and was kind enough
to put her shoes outside.

535
00:38:10,489 --> 00:38:11,690
Bong Yi, it wasn't you.

536
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,500
Tell them so. You didn't kill him.

537
00:38:14,829 --> 00:38:15,829
Bong Yi.

538
00:38:17,429 --> 00:38:18,429
Bong Yi...

539
00:38:41,289 --> 00:38:42,730
There are drag marks.

540
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:31,570
Officer Jung, I finally found out...

541
00:39:32,139 --> 00:39:34,110
how Kang Deok Soo was murdered.

542
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,280
Yu Na heard a sound.

543
00:39:36,309 --> 00:39:37,809
When Kang Deok Soo turned around,

544
00:39:37,849 --> 00:39:39,219
she said she threw some dirt at him.

545
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,280
That sound must've come from the culprit.
The one who murdered him.

546
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:07,340
Once Yu Na hid in this cabinet,

547
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,780
they locked it
so that she wouldn't come out.

548
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:11,880
Now, look here.

549
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,449
Here.

550
00:40:14,519 --> 00:40:15,920
They had moved this pipe.

551
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:33,699
After preparing everything,

552
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,369
they waited above the bridge
for him to appear.

553
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:40,639
Where did you go?

554
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:04,400
Where did you go?

555
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,840
Where did you go?

556
00:41:33,829 --> 00:41:35,760
Bong Yi had fractured ribs and wrist.

557
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:37,969
Are you saying that she pulled him
all the way to the top?

558
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,670
When she was 50kg and him, 70kg?

559
00:41:47,539 --> 00:41:51,179
The culprit is a well-built male
in his 20s or early 30s.

560
00:41:52,349 --> 00:41:54,550
Look here. Do you see the drag marks?

561
00:41:55,519 --> 00:41:57,119
He pulled him up by a rope.

562
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,420
Do you still suspect her?

563
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:00,860
That poor child.

564
00:42:03,159 --> 00:42:04,230
You're fine now.

565
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:06,260
The detectives won't harass you again.

566
00:42:07,059 --> 00:42:08,960
Thank you, Mr. Go.

567
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:10,329
Don't say that.

568
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:12,570
I can't believe they suspected
the wrong person.

569
00:42:14,139 --> 00:42:16,210
Get some rest. I'll leave you to rest.

570
00:42:34,159 --> 00:42:35,260
Oh, no.

571
00:42:57,949 --> 00:42:59,010
Yu Na.

572
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,590
Yu Na.

573
00:43:04,489 --> 00:43:05,590
Yu Na.

574
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:29,179
Yu Na.

575
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:54,269
Mr. Go?

576
00:44:13,719 --> 00:44:15,590
Today at 11am, the President paid...

577
00:44:15,619 --> 00:44:19,289
an unannounced visit to the special task
force at Mujin Metropolitan Police Agency.

578
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,400
During his unannounced visit,

579
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:25,030
the team gave a brief summary
of Kang Deok Soo case,

580
00:44:25,099 --> 00:44:27,599
and the President ordered
a thorough investigation...

581
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:29,840
and encouraged the detectives
in charge of the case.

582
00:44:56,199 --> 00:44:58,030
I clearly remember I put it here.

583
00:44:58,130 --> 00:45:00,400
(A few days before the incident)

584
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:09,909
It's my pay to kill.

585
00:45:10,809 --> 00:45:13,780
A kid gave it to me
and asked me to kill a bad guy.

586
00:45:14,179 --> 00:45:15,480
I'll take the job.

587
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:17,690
This is my pay.

588
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:25,429
Where did I drop it?

589
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:28,829
Then I heard a sound.

590
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:33,400
Officer Jung...

591
00:45:33,469 --> 00:45:34,639
Where's everybody?

592
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,409
What are you so excited about?

593
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:38,940
I'm glad that Bong Yi was
cleared of suspicion.

594
00:45:39,639 --> 00:45:43,280
By the way, doesn't Bong Yi
look a little like Da Seul?

595
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:45,349
Does she?

596
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:47,280
I guess she does.

597
00:45:47,949 --> 00:45:50,019
Da Seul is much prettier than her though.

598
00:45:50,590 --> 00:45:52,090
By the way, where is Officer Jung?

599
00:45:52,219 --> 00:45:53,519
I came here to give him
my wedding invitation.

600
00:45:53,690 --> 00:45:55,719
I wonder if he knows I won't accept
any wedding gifts.

601
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:56,960
Of course, he knows.

602
00:45:57,030 --> 00:45:59,630
It's the wedding
of the son of a presidential candidate.

603
00:45:59,699 --> 00:46:00,960
What else should I do?

604
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,559
I asked if we could put off our wedding
a little,

605
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:05,670
she got upset and said, "I don't want to
wear a wedding dress with a baby bump."

606
00:46:07,739 --> 00:46:09,969
Mu Chi, take a look at this.

607
00:46:10,070 --> 00:46:11,269
Look at this.

608
00:46:12,769 --> 00:46:14,210
My precious baby.

609
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:17,809
I can tell that my baby will become an FL.

610
00:46:17,909 --> 00:46:19,449
FL? What is that?

611
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:21,449
It's fashion leader, you old man.

612
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:22,750
Do you know what you are?

613
00:46:23,289 --> 00:46:24,550
You're an FT.

614
00:46:24,619 --> 00:46:26,690
- An FT?
- Fashion terrorist.

615
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:31,289
I want my baby to be a pretty girl
like her.

616
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:34,329
By the way, why are you watching
Yu Na's statement?

617
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,530
I told you to stay away from our case.

618
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:39,739
To be honest, I hope
that the culprit won't be caught.

619
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:42,840
I bet this kid wants that
more than anyone else.

620
00:46:46,639 --> 00:46:47,809
That's weird.

621
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:50,050
Why does Yu Na seem to be lying?

622
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:52,010
- What?
- Watch this.

623
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:54,280
She keeps covering her mouth
with her hand.

624
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:56,150
That's what kids usually do
when they tell a lie.

625
00:46:56,289 --> 00:46:58,389
Also, she keeps looking up to the right.

626
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:00,360
This is what kids usually do...

627
00:47:00,389 --> 00:47:02,190
when they think of petty tricks
or tell a lie.

628
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:03,590
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

629
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:05,960
I told you many times
that I majored in child psychology.

630
00:47:06,699 --> 00:47:09,929
- What about touching her nose?
- They do that too when lying.

631
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:13,039
The nose is itchy
because catecholamines are released...

632
00:47:13,070 --> 00:47:14,469
when they tell a lie.

633
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,940
I think she saw something.

634
00:47:18,539 --> 00:47:19,739
What... What did she see?

635
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:21,780
You saw something, didn't you?

636
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:24,909
Don't worry.

637
00:47:25,349 --> 00:47:27,250
The police officers will keep you safe.

638
00:47:27,519 --> 00:47:28,980
Police officers?

639
00:47:34,219 --> 00:47:35,320
Yes.

640
00:47:36,159 --> 00:47:38,360
I'm sure that Yu Na saw something,
but she won't tell me.

641
00:47:38,889 --> 00:47:40,159
Go and talk to Bong Yi.

642
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:41,829
She's the only person
who can make Yu Na talk.

643
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:44,630
Yu Na might be in danger,
so I'll stay here.

644
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:46,400
- Yu Na?
- Yes.

645
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:48,139
He said he was sure
that she had seen something.

646
00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:50,269
But she won't tell him anything.

647
00:47:50,639 --> 00:47:53,739
So he said, "You can tell me.
I'm a police officer."

648
00:47:53,909 --> 00:47:55,440
But that only made her not speak at all.

649
00:47:56,349 --> 00:47:57,409
Really?

650
00:47:58,179 --> 00:48:00,619
- Such a little girl...
- Did she see Mr. Go?

651
00:48:01,179 --> 00:48:02,550
I'm sure she saw me.

652
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:05,650
Yu Na... I can't let her tell the truth.

653
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:10,829
He said that you're the only person
who can convince Yu Na.

654
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,059
Yes, of course. I'll meet her.

655
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:14,800
Yu Na will tell me everything.

656
00:48:14,829 --> 00:48:16,230
Then I'll bring her here.

657
00:48:16,570 --> 00:48:18,300
Bong Yi, let's go to see her.

658
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:21,269
The doctor said that you could go home.

659
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:23,969
Right. That'd be better.
We'll go to see her.

660
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:26,039
- Then I'll tell Mu Chi.
- Okay.

661
00:48:27,739 --> 00:48:28,880
Wait here.

662
00:48:29,079 --> 00:48:30,849
I'll finish the discharge procedure
as quickly as possible.

663
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:31,909
Okay.

664
00:48:40,389 --> 00:48:43,559
What on earth did she see?
There's no way she saw my face.

665
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:46,829
What did she see?

666
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,300
She'll probably tell Bong Yi everything.

667
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:55,800
I have to make sure she won't meet Yu Na.

668
00:48:58,210 --> 00:49:00,639
Hey, what brings you here?
We sent all the evidence.

669
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:03,079
The thing is...

670
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:07,519
The clothes Bong Yi was wearing
when she was taken to the hospital...

671
00:49:08,019 --> 00:49:11,090
are different from the ones she wore
in the dashcam footage of Ms. Choi's car.

672
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:14,489
- Her clothes?
- I saw it while organizing the evidence.

673
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:17,760
Look here. They look different, right?

674
00:49:21,329 --> 00:49:22,400
Wait.

675
00:49:23,869 --> 00:49:24,969
What is this?

676
00:49:29,369 --> 00:49:30,610
That's the murder weapon.

677
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:42,250
Bong Yi, there's a lot of people
waiting here.

678
00:49:42,449 --> 00:49:43,849
It's almost done.

679
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:54,230
Hello? Is this Ms. Cho Mi Jeong's mother?

680
00:49:54,530 --> 00:49:56,570
I'm calling
because I'd like to interview you...

681
00:49:56,730 --> 00:50:00,840
for a special episode
about the serial murders in Mujin...

682
00:50:03,070 --> 00:50:05,440
I'm taking Eun Chong out for a walk.

683
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:28,760
Stop. Wait. I'll go.

684
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:30,369
- Okay.
- Okay.

685
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:36,670
Ms. Choi Hong Ju.

686
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:40,179
Where did you put them?

687
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:43,150
- What do you mean?
- Oh Bong Yi's clothes.

688
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,809
You let her change into similar clothes
at the parking lot of the hospital.

689
00:50:46,179 --> 00:50:48,119
We missed it because she was wearing
similar clothes.

690
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:52,389
The clothes covered with Kang Deok Soo's
blood and the knife in her hand.

691
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:53,889
Where did you hide them?

692
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:02,829
Bong Yi!

693
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:05,769
Are you all right?

694
00:51:42,539 --> 00:51:43,670
Hand them over.

695
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:45,869
You know how serious
destruction of evidence charges are.

696
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:48,510
The maximum sentence is
five years imprisonment.

697
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:53,079
Do you want this child to lose its mother?

698
00:52:23,139 --> 00:52:24,280
Ms. Oh Bong Yi.

699
00:52:24,610 --> 00:52:25,909
Will you come to the police station?

700
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:32,619
How many times did I say it's not her?

701
00:52:33,219 --> 00:52:37,030
Her clothes and the knife she bought
are covered in Kang Deok Soo's blood.

702
00:52:46,570 --> 00:52:49,170
Yu Na, I have to buy some trash bags.

703
00:52:49,239 --> 00:52:51,570
Put the books in there
and take the newspaper down.

704
00:52:51,639 --> 00:52:52,739
Okay.

705
00:53:13,159 --> 00:53:14,429
Are you moving away?

706
00:53:14,659 --> 00:53:15,599
Yes.

707
00:53:15,630 --> 00:53:19,400
Reporters keep coming by,
and Mom hates it.

708
00:53:21,369 --> 00:53:23,340
I'll help you.

709
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:28,010
Yu Na. You saw something that night.

710
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:33,420
What did you see?

711
00:53:36,949 --> 00:53:38,320
It's you, isn't it?

712
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:48,530
I saw this when you locked the door.

713
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,590
Eventually, Sung Yo Han...

714
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:55,730
will take over my brain completely.

715
00:54:59,869 --> 00:55:01,400
What then?

716
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:04,309
How will I handle that?

717
00:55:06,539 --> 00:55:07,909
I'm scared.

718
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:11,480
- I'm scared.
- What are you doing here?

719
00:55:17,550 --> 00:55:19,619
You're upset about Bong Yi.

720
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:28,900
I'm scared.

721
00:55:31,429 --> 00:55:32,900
I'm scared.

722
00:55:34,599 --> 00:55:37,010
I'm scared. I'm scared.

723
00:56:23,789 --> 00:56:25,789
Hang on. Where did they go?

724
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:37,530
Hello.

725
00:56:39,929 --> 00:56:41,039
What?

726
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:42,570
It's this, right?

727
00:56:43,469 --> 00:56:46,570
Why did you call me first?

728
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:50,909
In case it has Bong Yi's prints or DNA.

729
00:56:51,179 --> 00:56:52,309
What?

730
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:54,280
To be honest,

731
00:56:54,650 --> 00:56:57,190
even if she killed Kang Deok Soo,
I don't think she should be punished.

732
00:56:57,449 --> 00:56:59,619
I left 1,000 comments with my ID.

733
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:10,630
Here you go.

734
00:57:19,010 --> 00:57:20,070
What's this?

735
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,980
Detective Go. Bong Yi was released?

736
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:35,989
Ba Reum. Mu Chi.

737
00:57:37,730 --> 00:57:39,059
You pulled through.

738
00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:41,960
- Let's get something to eat.
- Okay.

739
00:57:44,199 --> 00:57:45,300
Hurry up.

740
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:49,639
I'm sorry. I had no choice.

741
00:57:56,980 --> 00:57:58,250
I have a kid.

742
00:57:59,579 --> 00:58:01,449
If something happens to me,

743
00:58:02,550 --> 00:58:05,789
I have no family or friends to take...

744
00:58:06,989 --> 00:58:08,389
in the kid.

745
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:13,059
I understand.

746
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:18,769
About what I asked you to do.

747
00:58:22,239 --> 00:58:23,340
Here you go.

748
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:32,449
Do you think...

749
00:58:33,949 --> 00:58:35,820
I killed him?

750
00:58:38,219 --> 00:58:39,449
I did at first.

751
00:58:39,690 --> 00:58:42,420
That's why I hid your clothes and knife.

752
00:58:43,829 --> 00:58:45,690
But then I realized it wasn't you.

753
00:58:48,199 --> 00:58:50,130
What made you realize that...

754
00:58:51,030 --> 00:58:52,800
it wasn't me?

755
00:58:54,469 --> 00:58:55,670
I just did.

756
00:58:56,769 --> 00:58:58,110
I just knew.

757
00:59:03,179 --> 00:59:04,210
Get some rest.

758
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:09,349
Thank you.

759
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:16,289
For letting him be.

760
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:02,670
Help me.

761
01:00:05,469 --> 01:00:08,039
Help me.

762
01:00:16,550 --> 01:00:18,289
He deserved to die.

763
01:00:33,469 --> 01:00:34,639
Why won't you get out?

764
01:00:44,610 --> 01:00:47,420
Don't you want to know
why Bong Yi was released?

765
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:54,420
You didn't ask.

766
01:00:56,789 --> 01:00:58,159
Why was she let go?

767
01:00:59,659 --> 01:01:03,059
Detective Shin found
the murder weapon right here.

768
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,570
It wasn't Bong Yi's knife,
but the real murder weapon.

769
01:01:09,239 --> 01:01:12,039
The culprit must've wrapped it
around a raincoat and tossed it in.

770
01:01:12,110 --> 01:01:13,409
It was pouring that day.

771
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:14,739
They must've thought
the strong water current...

772
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:17,050
would've carried it far away.

773
01:01:17,679 --> 01:01:20,110
But the deity up there
helped us once again.

774
01:01:20,650 --> 01:01:23,250
It got stuck here and was discovered.

775
01:01:23,679 --> 01:01:26,849
The blood found on the knife
and Kang Deok Soo's raincoat...

776
01:01:26,889 --> 01:01:29,860
had someone else's DNA as well.

777
01:01:30,289 --> 01:01:32,730
Bong Yi was released
because it wasn't hers.

778
01:01:34,829 --> 01:01:37,570
The culprit must've gotten injured
while stabbing him.

779
01:01:47,079 --> 01:01:48,139
But you know what?

780
01:01:50,550 --> 01:01:53,150
I just don't understand the result.

781
01:01:57,190 --> 01:01:58,289
I'm baffled.

782
01:02:00,119 --> 01:02:02,820
I don't know what to think of this.

783
01:02:45,730 --> 01:02:48,099
(Mouse)

784
01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:51,440
Jung Ba Reum
and Sung Yo Han's consciences...

785
01:02:51,469 --> 01:02:52,909
are fighting with each other.

786
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:56,010
But currently, your good conscience
is subduing the predator's.

787
01:02:56,309 --> 01:02:58,909
What about the Suseong Serial Murder Case?

788
01:02:58,949 --> 01:03:01,480
Officer Jung seems to like you a lot.

789
01:03:01,679 --> 01:03:02,980
You deserve to be finally happy.

790
01:03:04,449 --> 01:03:07,690
I should prepare myself
before Sung Yo Han's instincts awaken.

791
01:03:07,719 --> 01:03:10,690
Is the owner of the blue toothbrush
your next target?

792
01:03:10,789 --> 01:03:11,929
What's going on?

793
01:03:12,429 --> 01:03:14,460
Detective Go is a predator?
