Can you check if it was him?

19

Yes, it's him.
He's the one who operated on you.

How did Han Seo Joon operate on me?

32

The victim's age.

33
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:04,780
Then is the number after that
the order in which they died?

34

It's the abbreviation of
"subject of experiment"?

Experiment subject.

55
00:05:54,089 --> 00:05:57,430
There was no ear to punch,
so he punched her little finger instead?

To human beings...

57
00:06:02,069 --> 00:06:03,870
What did he experiment on them?

58
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,310
A brain injury...

59
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,639
can't bring upon
a sense of smell you didn't have.

60
00:06:12,709 --> 00:06:14,480
But there is one way.

61
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,009
It's possible if you transplant...

62
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:17,550
the frontal lobe that has
the olfactory bulb.

63
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,149
Transplant...

64
00:06:20,689 --> 00:06:23,350
- the frontal lobe?
- What did he do to the mouse's head?

65
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:30,230
If you let it live,
you'll end up like the snake.

66

Is that what you want?

67
00:06:32,129 --> 00:06:34,230
A bad brain has been placed
in this mouse's head.

"A bad brain"?

69
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:39,939
I think you've changed a bit.
You're not like before.

70
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,470
Did you have a look inside
a psychopath's head?

71
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:45,240
What is this feeling?

72
00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:50,550
That's why I have...

73
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,379
Sung Yo Han's memories.

74
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:01,629
Did you...

75
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,529
implant that murderer
Sung Yo Han's brain in here?

76
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,370
Did you?

77
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:16,610
You noticed sooner than
I thought. That's no fun.

78
00:07:19,209 --> 00:07:20,579
"Headhunter".

79
00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:24,220
The nickname that people gave me.

80
00:07:26,019 --> 00:07:27,449
I like it very much.

81
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,360
So the reason you killed people
and then took their heads...

82
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:36,689
Not always. Some heads,
I opened while they were still alive.

83
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:44,100
Everything was perfect.

84
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:47,509
The murders and the experiments.

85
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:51,110
Success was there, right before me, but...

86
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,250
That darn kid.

87
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,050
Die!

88
00:07:57,949 --> 00:07:59,519
What is it? What happened?

89
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:01,449
He was arrested on site
for Woo Jae Pil's murder.

90
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:02,790
He killed Woo Jae Pil?

91
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:05,389
Hey! You went and did it?

92
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:07,259
Are you insane? What will you do now?

93
00:08:07,329 --> 00:08:09,490
- What about your future?
- Ki Hyuk!

94
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:11,129
- Mu Chi. Mu Chi!
- Let him go.

95
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,529
Hey!

96
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,370
Ki Hyuk.

97
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:16,100
Mu Chi.

98
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:19,100
I ended up in here because of that kid.

99
00:08:21,069 --> 00:08:22,410
Don't give me that look.

100
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:24,480
For the good of mankind,

101
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,110
I sacrificed just a few human heads.

102
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:31,720
Every great accomplishment
incurs a trivial sacrifice.

103
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,919
- Don't you agree?
- "Trivial"?

104
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:36,720
Human lives are trivial?

105
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,889
Thanks to their sacrifices,

106
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,830
you are still alive and in that seat.

107
00:08:41,889 --> 00:08:43,490
No, it's a lie!

108
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:54,409
What happened? He killed Woo Jae Pil?

109
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,409
Let's talk outside.

110
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,850
He killed Woo Jae Pil
to get to Han Seo Joon?

111
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:09,490
To go into the detention center
Han Seo Joon is in?

112
00:09:11,389 --> 00:09:15,159
It always worried me,
and he crossed the line eventually.

113
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,100
That was the reason.

114
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,240
The reason he pushed you away.

115
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,750
He was going to kill Han Seo Joon
and become a murderer.

116
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,279
He knew he couldn't involve you...

117
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:39,850
I mean, he decided he shouldn't.

118
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:43,450
He was going to confess his love
for you that very day.

119
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,529
Your eyes might start bleeding soon.

120
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,100
Stop glaring.

121
00:09:55,129 --> 00:09:57,200
Hey, you have a nosebleed.

122
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:03,240
You're not studying for an exam, you know.

123
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,940
You haven't slept in three days.

124
00:10:05,009 --> 00:10:07,309
Get some sleep. I'll stand guard.

125
00:10:09,649 --> 00:10:11,120
Those sisters...

126
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,019
were sexually assaulted
and battered to death with a hammer.

127
00:10:14,289 --> 00:10:17,019
Can you really sleep, thinking about
how their parents must feel?

128
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,860
I'm going to put him behind bars
at all costs.

129
00:10:26,299 --> 00:10:28,529
What? What is this?

130
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:31,100
Darn it. Why would you look
inside my glovebox?

131
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:34,509
You're planning to ask Ms. Choi out,
aren't you?

132
00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:37,440
- No.
- Don't lie.

133
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,279
Everyone knows you have feelings for her.

134
00:10:41,309 --> 00:10:43,610
Darn it. Is it that obvious?

135
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,019
Yes. Terribly.

136
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,090
When will you do it?

137
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,289
Tomorrow. She's going to treat me
to dinner because I helped her...

138
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,860
with her investigation.

139
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,990
I think it's the best time to do it.

140
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:57,700
But what if I get rejected?

141
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:00,700
Ki Hyuk. To be honest,
I'm extremely nervous.

142
00:11:01,429 --> 00:11:02,500
Feel it.

143
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:08,440
There was never an ounce of fear in you
whenever you confronted killers.

144
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:11,779
Gosh, this must be the power of love.

145
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:15,850
Isn't she on air right now?

146
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:17,850
Don't turn it on. This is a stakeout.

147
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:19,250
Then don't watch.

148
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,049
(Han Seo Joon)

149
00:11:24,419 --> 00:11:25,659
I have found...

150
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:29,159
peace in my heart.

151
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,730
I am no longer tormented by nightmares.

152
00:11:34,029 --> 00:11:36,230
I've repented my sins to the Lord
and have been forgiven.

153
00:11:36,669 --> 00:11:38,970
I feel so much lighter.

154
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:43,440
These days, I even sleep so soundly.

155
00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:46,610
Come to think of it,

156
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,809
this dashcam will record everything.

157
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,980
We'll be punished for dereliction of duty.

158
00:11:54,889 --> 00:11:57,190
Right. Today is
the culprit's mother's death anniversary,

159
00:11:57,419 --> 00:11:58,690
so he might show up.

160
00:11:58,789 --> 00:12:01,259
He may be lurking around
this neighborhood,

161
00:12:01,289 --> 00:12:02,629
so I'll take a look.

162
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:10,029
I want...

163
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:14,570
the bereaved families of the victims
to find peace.

164
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:17,509
- I've been praying...
- You've found peace in your heart?

165
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,179
every day.

166
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,679
You're sleeping soundly now?

167
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:22,980
I am still...

168
00:12:23,649 --> 00:12:26,679
- living with so much pain every day.
- This killer...

169
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,320
- I'm living in a nightmare.
- has shocked the entire world.

170
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:30,620
- It's Han Seo Joon, the Headhunter.
- You scumbag.

171
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:33,519
After repenting to the Lord
and asking for forgiveness,

172
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:36,460
- he says he has found peace.
- Why are you still alive?

173
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:39,029
Why aren't you getting
your death sentence?

174
00:12:39,299 --> 00:12:40,830
Darn it.

175
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:43,500
Have the bereaved families
found peace as well?

176
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,309
We had requested an interview
with a bereaved family member.

177
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:50,539
If the government won't do it,
then I will.

178
00:12:51,179 --> 00:12:53,809
- Then we met Father Go Mu Won,
- I'm going to kill your myself.

179
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,210
a bereaved family member,

180
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,519
- I will kill you.
- and he told us something shocking.

181
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,789
Father Go Mu Won, who studied theology
at a comparatively older age,

182
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,659
filed a petition,
asking that Han Seo Joon...

183
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,590
not be given the death sentence.

184
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:10,559
Forgiveness brought salvation to him.

185
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,230
I'll let you go.

186
00:13:22,409 --> 00:13:23,309
Go.

187
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:25,179
Sorry?

188
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,679
Run.

189
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:28,779
Go on.

190
00:13:35,289 --> 00:13:37,120
Are you crazy?

191
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:39,889
- Have you gone insane?
- Move!

192
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,889
Snap out of it!
Come to your senses, Mu Chi!

193
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:48,000
If you stop me one more time,
I'll kill you first.

194
00:13:48,669 --> 00:13:50,370
You should've just fired him.

195
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,970
Why was he transferred to your team?

196
00:13:53,769 --> 00:13:57,940
Why was he transferred to a team
that allowed him to carry firearms?

197
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,080
It was intentional, wasn't it?

198
00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:04,480
You knew what he was planning to do.

199
00:14:04,549 --> 00:14:06,779
You were using that poor guy, weren't you?

200
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:10,450
You wanted him to avenge your daughter,

201
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:12,590
didn't you?

202
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,659
You lunatic. That's enough.

203
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:16,190
How dare you talk to him like that?

204
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:18,629
Gosh.

205
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,899
I'm sorry.
He's not a good drinker to begin with.

206
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:24,000
He's just upset about him.

207
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:26,570
What should I do about that poor guy?

208
00:14:53,299 --> 00:14:57,200
(Visitation Information)

209
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:05,840
Hello? He seems to be quite shocked.

210
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,019
(About 30 years ago)

211
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:20,090
Well, it's CP.

212
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,860
The location of the hemorrhage
must've been rather tricky.

213
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:24,399
But you did great work.

214
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:27,460
And the patient's current condition
is good as well.

215
00:15:27,629 --> 00:15:30,370
I understand she's a patient
of Dr. Gary's.

216
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,799
Precisely. 15 years ago,
when she was 5 years old,

217
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:36,370
she was diagnosed with CP by Dr. Gary.

218
00:15:36,409 --> 00:15:39,840
Well, you're in good hands now.
We'll take very good care of you.

219
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:42,580
If you need anything, anything at all,
don't hesitate to ask.

220
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,659
Are you the one reading this book?

221
00:16:04,299 --> 00:16:05,669
Levodopa?

222
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:09,110
This is a dopamine-deficiency supplement.

223
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:11,909
Who gave you this?

224
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:14,750
That's strange. Where did you get that?

225
00:16:15,049 --> 00:16:18,049
There was only a man
cleaning the rubbish bin.

226
00:16:18,379 --> 00:16:19,250
A cleaner?

227
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,879
I agree, Dr. Pattinson.

228
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,690
- It's extremely...
- No...

229
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,330
Do you know why the professor asked me
to do the surgery...

230
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,200
that you were supposed to do?

231
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:34,929
Your patient, Emma.

232
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:38,870
Nobody thinks she died
in a medical accident.

233
00:16:39,539 --> 00:16:40,940
You killed her, didn't you?

234
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:47,509
What do you mean?

235
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:49,809
Dr. Gary is investigating.

236
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:52,220
It's not long before the mask
you're wearing comes off.

237
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:58,559
You've noticed?

238
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:02,289
Was I too careless?

239
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:11,000
Should I give a real performance then?

240
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:28,150
You're refusing to believe it.

241
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:31,759
Fine, then. Go there yourself...

242
00:17:32,019 --> 00:17:33,859
and confirm it with your own eyes.

243
00:17:48,509 --> 00:17:51,680
As you know, this patient was diagnosed...

244
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:55,250
with cerebral palsy by Dr. Gary
at the age of five...

245
00:17:55,349 --> 00:17:57,950
and has lived, relying on a wheelchair.

246
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,579
From now on,

247
00:17:59,619 --> 00:18:04,660
I will show you the miraculous magic
of this lady getting up.

248
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:06,089
Impossible.

249
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,690
This patient considered herself...

250
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:44,089
to have cerebral palsy for 15 years.

251
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,230
Wait.

252
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:48,730
Are you implying that I misdiagnosed?

253
00:18:48,769 --> 00:18:49,869
That's right.

254
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,670
Misdiagnosis.

255
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,210
This patient has a rare disease...

256
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,670
with the lack of dopamine in the body...

257
00:18:57,769 --> 00:18:59,910
due to a GCH-1...

258
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:03,210
gene mutation located in chromosome 14.

259
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:05,950
It's called Segawa Syndrome.

260
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,720
"Segawa Syndrome"?

261
00:19:08,089 --> 00:19:10,250
I saw a book in the patient's room.

262
00:19:10,289 --> 00:19:13,289
The congenital CP patients also have...

263
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:15,390
intellectual disabilities.

264
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:18,660
But it wasn't shown from this patient.

265
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:22,369
The symptoms of CP have features
of worsening...

266
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,569
in the afternoon.

267
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:26,400
Accordingly, I made the patient...

268
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:29,440
take half of a levodopa pill
three times a day...

269
00:19:29,509 --> 00:19:32,609
to replenish the dopamine deficiency.

270
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,509
The results are as you can see.

271
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,650
Thank you, Seo Joon.

272
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,750
You gave me a new chance at life.

273
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,980
You're my savior.

274
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:43,920
I'm not the one you should be thankful to.

275
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,160
But, him.

276
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:56,000
Daniel is in charge of that ward.
He just got off.

277
00:19:57,829 --> 00:19:59,039
Daniel.

278
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,769
- Daniel.
- Jennifer.

279
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:03,569
What are you doing out here?

280
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:09,009
Daniel, I walked 400 steps
by myself today.

281
00:20:09,109 --> 00:20:10,480
Really? Good job.

282
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:12,279
Great. The medication is working.

283
00:20:13,019 --> 00:20:14,720
- Let's go in. Take your medication.
- Oh, right.

284
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:16,589
What happened to that patient?

285
00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:18,920
The one with the same disease as me.

286
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,460
I've been giving her these pills secretly.

287
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:26,799
Cerebral palsy, my foot.
Why can't those doctors see it?

288
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,329
- Let's go in. Be careful.
- Why don't you tell them?

289
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:47,480
He's the one who identified
that this patient...

290
00:20:47,549 --> 00:20:49,519
has Segawa syndrome.

291
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,490
If wasn't for him,

292
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:53,819
she would have been in a wheelchair...

293
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,529
for her lifetime.

294
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:59,799
Thanks to him, Dr. Gary
who was suspicious of me...

295
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,529
had to leave the hospital.

296
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:04,299
And I got to clear myself
of the suspicion...

297
00:21:04,369 --> 00:21:06,099
of killing a patient.

298
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:11,009
Excuse me.

299
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:16,910
I brought you a gift.

300
00:21:17,549 --> 00:21:19,220
I can't afford to buy you a nice gift.

301
00:21:19,819 --> 00:21:21,750
But there are a lot of rats
in my neighborhood.

302
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,390
Why are you giving me these...

303
00:21:23,549 --> 00:21:24,890
I got a call from the association.

304
00:21:25,059 --> 00:21:27,289
They offered me a job
at the genetics research center.

305
00:21:27,589 --> 00:21:29,789
I'll also get a full scholarship
to a university. I owe it all...

306
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,029
to you, Mr. Han.

307
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,630
Thank you.

308
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:38,099
I should be thanking you.

309
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,039
You were my best work that helped me...

310
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:44,369
hide my true colors.

311
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:49,380
I had my own lab.

312
00:21:50,349 --> 00:21:53,579
No one has found it yet.

313
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:58,819
Once you open that door,
you will open Pandora's box.

314
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:03,890
Hey, by the way, what kind of experiment
are you doing with those rats?

315
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:05,900
A brain transplant.

316
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:08,829
- Really?
- The brain...

317
00:22:09,069 --> 00:22:11,940
has a huge number of neural connections,

318
00:22:12,099 --> 00:22:14,269
so access to nerves alone is impossible.

319
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:17,940
I'm figuring out the complex connections
to reconnect the nerves.

320
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:21,650
I'm also trying to find a way
to prevent immune rejection...

321
00:22:21,809 --> 00:22:23,180
after a transplant.

322
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:26,079
Why on earth are you trying to do that?

323
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,559
The brain weighs only 1.4kg,

324
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:41,569
but it stores a person's whole life.

325
00:22:43,069 --> 00:22:44,200
Isn't it interesting?

326
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:47,700
And I could determine a person's life too.

327
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:50,670
That's what a deity does.

328
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,410
There's nothing special
about being a deity.

329
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,410
A deity?

330
00:22:58,079 --> 00:22:59,819
What about you? What's your dream?

331
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,650
Me? I want to...

332
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:05,190
find good genes.

333
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:07,890
I want to find a way to tell genes
for good-heartedness from the bad ones...

334
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,490
to create a peaceful world
without wars or crimes.

335
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:13,900
One of the senior researchers
at my research center is Korean.

336
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:16,599
He also wants to create
that kind of utopia.

337
00:23:16,829 --> 00:23:19,670
How about you find bad genes instead?

338
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,240
If you find people with crime genes,

339
00:23:22,309 --> 00:23:23,839
and prevent crimes,

340
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:26,440
the world will become crime-free
as you hope for.

341
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,210
You're right.

342
00:23:28,349 --> 00:23:31,150
Then I'm going to find bad genes.

343
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:33,819
Good. Let's make sure
to make our dreams come true.

344
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,990
I think he said it was around here.

345
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:47,500
Are you sure...

346
00:23:49,069 --> 00:23:50,500
you can handle the truth?

347
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:57,539
After killing Jennifer,
I moved back to Korea,

348
00:23:57,609 --> 00:23:59,440
and became the best neurologist in Korea.

349
00:24:00,339 --> 00:24:02,680
While indulging myself
in the title of star doctor,

350
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,119
I forgot about my dream.

351
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:07,220
("Professor Daniel Lee Finds
Psychopath Gene")

352
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,490
Until Daniel...

353
00:24:08,819 --> 00:24:11,759
turned the world upside down.

354
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:49,630
It was just a random idea.

355
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:53,599
How dare he invade my territory
of being almighty?

356
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:57,390
These won't work. They're useless.

357
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,250
You haven't eaten anything, have you?

358
00:26:16,609 --> 00:26:18,250
Would you like to have some meat with me?

359
00:26:18,549 --> 00:26:20,920
What? Meat? Sounds great.

360
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:22,619
I want charcoal grilled ribs.

361
00:26:24,019 --> 00:26:25,119
Let's go.

362
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:32,099
I needed brains.

363
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:35,130
- Human brains.
- Gross.

364
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:18,309
You may enter now.

365
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:27,579
Did something happen?

366
00:27:28,019 --> 00:27:30,349
- A statement, please!
- Detective, any comments?

367
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:33,559
How could a police officer
murder a person?

368
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:35,829
- Answer the question!
- How did you kill him?

369
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:37,329
- Say a few words, please!
- Say something!

370
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:39,000
- Mr. Go?
- A statement, please!

371
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,670
(Death to Headhunter!)

372
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:54,779
(Death to Headhunter!)

373
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:57,710
(Monster)

374
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:00,019
(Murderer)

375
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:05,259
Everything was perfect.

376
00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:09,029
I was about to succeed
in a brain transplant.

377
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:15,200
And my son...

378
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:17,700
was going to be born soon.

379
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:27,339
But then I got a call from Daniel.

380
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,750
He said he would visit Korea.

381
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,250
Wasn't it hard for you to live in the UK?

382
00:28:33,319 --> 00:28:34,950
It was hard to adjust
to the new environment.

383
00:28:35,019 --> 00:28:38,759
You were a mere prop for my performance.

384
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:43,559
I won't let you have...

385
00:28:44,029 --> 00:28:46,660
the almighty power
that I've been dreaming of.

386
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,769
I became impatient.

387
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:53,240
I needed prey immediately.

388
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,170
- I had one last experiment left.
- Do you know where it is?

389
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,549
2 and 3.

390
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:06,019
Three brains.

391
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:09,420
They were enough materials...

392
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:11,720
for my final experiment.

393
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:18,960
Let's go.

394
00:29:21,829 --> 00:29:22,900
Is it fast enough?

395
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,869
- Go faster.
- Where's the spring?

396
00:29:25,069 --> 00:29:27,269
Do you see that? It's up that way.

397
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:48,319
Don't kill me. Let me go.

398
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,730
Run away. Go, now!

399
00:29:56,869 --> 00:29:58,000
Darn you.

400
00:30:03,569 --> 00:30:05,009
Everything was perfect.

401
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:08,880
I'd killed almost 20 people over a year...

402
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:11,680
and had never made a mistake.

403
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:15,289
I'd thought it was a perfect murder.

404
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:22,789
Mom... Mom...

405
00:30:33,269 --> 00:30:35,740
Wait for me, Han Seo Joon.

406
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,289
Go Mu Chi killed
the suspect of the knot murders.

407
00:30:55,829 --> 00:30:56,990
Well done.

408
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:01,799
You did it, kiddo.

409
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:06,200
I guess I should make my neck extra clean.

410
00:31:13,579 --> 00:31:15,039
I must see her.

411
00:31:15,309 --> 00:31:16,710
I have something to say.

412
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,380
I have something to tell her.

413
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:20,019
- Please.
- You can't go inside.

414
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:33,430
How could you operate on me?

415
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,559
You're on death row.

416
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:36,799
I think it was
the day after your incident.

417
00:31:37,869 --> 00:31:39,099
I had a visitor.

418
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,599
I'm Officer Jung Ba Reum.

419
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:42,769
A very important visitor.

420
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:43,970
You remember me, don't you?

421
00:31:44,339 --> 00:31:46,539
I do, Officer Jung Ba Reum.

422
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:48,750
I was told that you got back to work.

423
00:31:48,849 --> 00:31:50,309
I'm glad to see you look well.

424
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:52,519
Why are you here?

425
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:55,450
You must have something to say to me.

426
00:32:00,259 --> 00:32:01,359
Get in my car.

427
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,529
This is your brain after the attack.

428
00:32:10,069 --> 00:32:12,470
And this is Sung Yo Han's brain.

429
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:15,170
Your frontal lobe was badly damaged.

430
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:19,039
We took Sung Yo Han's frontal lobe
and put that into your head.

431
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,940
How did you know
Han Seo Joon was capable of this?

432
00:32:22,109 --> 00:32:24,109
The day after you were attacked,

433
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:27,279
I received a tape
from an anonymous source.

434
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,690
Film from this angle
and make sure it's not shaky.

435
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,599
This video.

436
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,539
Where did you get it?

437
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:51,910
I will ask you point blank.

438
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,640
Did you succeed?

439
00:32:57,009 --> 00:32:59,650
Your son smashed in a young man's head.

440
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:03,650
His brain is so badly damaged,
there's nothing the doctors can do.

441
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:07,589
If a brain transplant were possible...

442
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,829
What if it were?

443
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:11,190
I plan to give it a go.

444
00:33:17,869 --> 00:33:21,269
I didn't think this of you,
but you're a very dangerous person.

445
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:24,640
How can you trust me with the surgery?

446
00:33:25,109 --> 00:33:28,339
It can't be that you don't know who I am.

447
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,210
He will die anyway if nothing is done.

448
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:32,880
What will you do for me?

449
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:37,420
If I do the surgery, or rather,

450
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,490
if I save the young man's life,

451
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,230
what will you do for me?

452
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,660
What do you want?

453
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,670
Give me freedom.

454
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:57,269
I was locked up for almost 30 years.

455
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,579
I feel suffocated.

456
00:34:00,339 --> 00:34:04,849
Letting someone with my skill
rot in a place like this...

457
00:34:05,779 --> 00:34:08,150
is a waste of national talent.

458
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:10,150
Don't you think?

459
00:34:12,059 --> 00:34:14,059
Then I'll bring the young man back.

460
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:19,829
Did you make sure security is tight?

461
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:22,300
This is a closed ward.

462
00:34:22,329 --> 00:34:23,800
Outsiders cannot come in.

463
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:27,170
The moment word of this gets out,
it's over for us all.

464
00:34:27,269 --> 00:34:28,400
Don't worry.

465
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:31,440
The minimum staff required,
prepared for the operation,

466
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:33,679
but they don't know
what the operation's for.

467
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:37,409
In return for reviving me,
you agreed to pardon him?

468
00:34:37,849 --> 00:34:38,980
No.

469
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:43,820
No? Why not?

470
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:47,389
I heard that
no president can go against you.

471
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,659
I'm just a chief secretary
that assists the president.

472
00:34:50,929 --> 00:34:54,429
Even if I had the power to pardon you,

473
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,329
I cannot accept your conditions.

474
00:34:59,539 --> 00:35:00,599
Fine, then.

475
00:35:01,769 --> 00:35:03,139
The negotiation's off.

476
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:06,880
Please do it.

477
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:12,380
Please.

478
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:16,019
Saving a young man's precious life.

479
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:20,519
This will be your only chance to
atone for what you did.

480
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:23,530
It's what the whole nation wants.

481
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:27,530
Save Jung Ba Reum's life.

482
00:35:35,369 --> 00:35:36,869
Atonement...

483
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,639
Atonement?

484
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:40,739
Atonement?

485
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:44,380
Do you think saving me means atonement?

486
00:35:47,449 --> 00:35:49,590
Why was it Sung Yo Han's brain?

487
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:53,590
Due to transport issues,
we couldn't use the brain we'd prepared.

488
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,219
Just then, we heard that...

489
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,559
Sung Yo Han had died of
acute respiratory failure.

490
00:35:57,690 --> 00:36:00,460
So under the consent of
Han Seo Joon, his father...

491
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,800
Is a criminal a guardian?

492
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:04,269
What you did was commit a crime.

493
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,599
If I must make an excuse,

494
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,239
it was because
I couldn't let down the public.

495
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:13,380
It was so you could stay in power.

496
00:36:13,409 --> 00:36:16,210
If I were to die, it would affect
the upcoming presidential election.

497
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:17,909
I can't help what you think,

498
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:20,250
but losing a good man like you...

499
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,590
felt like taking hope from the public
and that's sincerely how I saw it.

500
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:29,530
If it hadn't been for her courage,

501
00:36:29,559 --> 00:36:31,190
you'd be dead and gone.

502
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:33,000
Just so she could save you,

503
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:35,570
she went on her knees
in front of Han Seo Joon.

504
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,070
Do you think it's safe to let him go?

505
00:36:43,309 --> 00:36:45,880
- If he does something...
- He won't be able to tell.

506
00:36:46,179 --> 00:36:50,150
How could he tell the world that
a killer's brain is in his own head?

507
00:36:51,909 --> 00:36:53,449
About Han Seo Joon.

508
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,590
Why did he suddenly change his mind?

509
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:10,369
What should I atone for?

510
00:37:11,929 --> 00:37:15,710
I'm a lion that just ate a few mice.

511
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:26,420
After saying that,

512
00:37:27,849 --> 00:37:30,489
why did he decide to do the operation?

513
00:37:46,469 --> 00:37:49,110
This video. Where did you get it?

514
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:51,369
Someone sent it to me anonymously.

515
00:37:52,739 --> 00:37:54,510
You managed to stay alive.

516
00:38:06,489 --> 00:38:09,360
I saw the documentary and noticed
that only his interview...

517
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,829
was cropped out.

518
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:13,159
I was just curious.

519
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,500
What was he trying to check?

520
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:18,230
Was it...

521
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:22,469
No, he can't know.

522
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:30,750
I should've killed him then.

523
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:32,820
Back then.

524
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:36,449
(Correction Headquarters,
We do not use force or torture.)

525
00:38:41,489 --> 00:38:43,190
You have just ten minutes
for the interview.

526
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:47,429
(Correction Headquarters,
We do not use force or torture.)

527
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,019
Yes.

528
00:39:40,579 --> 00:39:41,949
It was her.

529
00:39:42,489 --> 00:39:43,989
Park Hyeon Soo.

530
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:46,519
So...

531
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:49,690
the reason why you made
that documentary...

532
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:52,860
was so that you could kill me?

533
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:56,329
How fascinating.

534
00:39:57,199 --> 00:39:58,829
Thanks to her documentary,

535
00:39:59,639 --> 00:40:01,699
a civil servant was sacrificed.

536
00:40:09,309 --> 00:40:10,510
Ba Reum!

537
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:13,679
- Bong Yi.
- What happened?

538
00:40:17,789 --> 00:40:19,760
I'm sorry. Something came up.

539
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:22,559
Did Mr. Go really kill that murderer?

540
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:25,960
What do you mean? He killed someone?

541
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:31,969
- Yes?
- Ms. Choi.

542
00:40:32,429 --> 00:40:35,869
What is this?
Detective Go killed Woo Jae Pil?

543
00:40:36,469 --> 00:40:37,710
He turned himself in.

544
00:40:37,739 --> 00:40:39,780
The other officers who were there
testified as well.

545
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:43,110
When they had arrived,
he was holding the murder weapon.

546
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:47,519
But something's strange.

547
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:48,980
What is it?

548
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:50,920
If he had brought a gun,
he should've used that.

549
00:40:51,289 --> 00:40:52,860
So why did he use a scalpel?

550
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:56,260
Where is the body?

551
00:41:07,369 --> 00:41:08,739
I see no defense wounds.

552
00:41:09,369 --> 00:41:12,579
If someone's attacking you,
you automatically defend yourself.

553
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:15,110
So why didn't he?

554
00:41:18,579 --> 00:41:20,920
I sense the rage in these wounds.

555
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:24,889
If Detective Go had really killed him,

556
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:26,559
it was to get locked up
alongside Han Seo Joon.

557
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:28,219
He never held a grudge
against Woo Jae Pil.

558
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:30,789
The wounds on the neck are the deepest.

559
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,599
That means the suspect
wanted this man to die.

560
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,260
Overkill.

561
00:41:34,329 --> 00:41:37,570
Woo Jae Pil had already died,
but the suspect kept stabbing him.

562
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:40,469
They were overcome with rage
to control themself.

563
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:44,610
Detective Go would've stabbed
his vital spot.

564
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,280
- Could you sign this, please?
- Okay.

565
00:42:18,769 --> 00:42:21,039
The police took all footage
of Detective Go.

566
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:24,510
Oh, we're here to check something else.

567
00:42:31,989 --> 00:42:34,260
What was that? Something sparkled.

568
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:35,590
I'll zoom in.

569
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:43,769
- Let's see.
- How did she come here?

570
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:46,199
I can't quite make it out.

571
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,309
Hold on. Let me check the other cameras.

572
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:06,360
I think I know who killed him.
I need to go.

573
00:43:11,829 --> 00:43:14,860
We're going to go see our baby.

574
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:16,869
We're going to go see our baby.

575
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:19,400
- Let's go. Come on.
- Honey.

576
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:20,739
Give me a minute.

577
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:23,309
Well...

578
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,510
We're on our way to turn ourselves in.

579
00:43:25,739 --> 00:43:27,809
If you arrest her here,
she'll be very terrified.

580
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,809
I was being dangerously greedy.

581
00:43:31,309 --> 00:43:34,820
I wanted Mu Chi to kill
our children's murderer.

582
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:37,119
I won't ask you to understand.

583
00:43:39,289 --> 00:43:40,559
Where is your daughter's grave?

584
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:45,889
I got you. Come on out.

585
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,000
- What do you mean?
- Just shut it and come out of there.

586
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:51,199
If it wasn't for Officer Jung...

587
00:43:52,099 --> 00:43:53,340
"Officer Jung"?

588
00:43:53,769 --> 00:43:56,039
Yes. He went to Inspector Park
in search of the killer.

589
00:43:56,269 --> 00:43:58,510
How did that kid know?

590
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:01,610
- About what?
- That his wife killed Woo Jae Pil.

591
00:44:02,579 --> 00:44:03,849
She did?

592
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:07,750
Jeong Man Ho!

593
00:44:17,659 --> 00:44:19,329
What are you doing
in front of my daughter's grave?

594
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:23,000
She's not your daughter.

595
00:44:24,199 --> 00:44:25,400
What do you mean?

596
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:30,269
The girl buried in here...

597
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:38,449
What in the world are you saying?

598
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:41,219
She's my daughter.

599
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,150
Mine.

600
00:44:46,619 --> 00:44:48,860
It's my dear Soo Jin.

601
00:45:06,039 --> 00:45:09,079
This man... Why is Jeong Man Ho...

602
00:45:39,579 --> 00:45:41,440
When Park Hyeon Soo was kidnapped
by Han Seo Joon,

603
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:43,880
two of the same hair tie
that she was wearing...

604
00:45:44,579 --> 00:45:46,420
were found.

605
00:45:46,449 --> 00:45:49,019
They did a DNA test
on the corpse's hair...

606
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:51,750
that was found in the hair tie,
and it was Park Hyeon Soo's.

607
00:45:51,989 --> 00:45:54,989
The moment Woo Jae Pil said...

608
00:45:55,059 --> 00:45:56,760
that he had killed Park Hyeon Soo,

609
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:59,929
Jeong Man Ho, a very close friend of his,

610
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,869
stabbed him with intense rage.

611
00:46:04,469 --> 00:46:05,630
Why?

612
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:09,539
Why did he kill...

613
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:11,909
Woo Jae Pil?

614
00:46:17,679 --> 00:46:19,409
Why did he?

615
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:22,119
I thought of my daughter.

616
00:46:22,179 --> 00:46:24,119
Hey. You don't have a daughter.

617
00:46:24,949 --> 00:46:28,420
What if he didn't lie?
What if he actually had a daughter?

618
00:46:29,059 --> 00:46:30,630
Guryeong in 1994.

619
00:46:30,730 --> 00:46:32,489
A girl had gone missing.

620
00:46:32,829 --> 00:46:34,030
Hold on.

621
00:46:34,599 --> 00:46:35,659
Here.

622
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:37,429
(Jeong Soo Jin, Father: Jeong Man Ho)

623
00:46:37,570 --> 00:46:39,500
Who are her parents?

624
00:46:39,739 --> 00:46:41,969
Only her father's name is here.
It's Jeong Man Ho.

625
00:46:43,809 --> 00:46:46,739
My poor Soo Jin...

626
00:46:49,579 --> 00:46:51,309
Soo Jin!

627
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:57,889
What... What are you doing?

628
00:46:57,989 --> 00:47:00,690
What is this about Jae Pil...

629
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:01,960
being the murderer?

630
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:04,429
Soo Jin!

631
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:05,889
Dad!

632
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:08,829
Why... Why is that...

633
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:28,920
This is an emergency situation.

634
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:31,619
Mujin Hospital, first floor.
An armed man is causing a commotion.

635
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:43,630
No, right?

636
00:47:43,829 --> 00:47:46,940
My daughter, Soo Jin... No, right?

637
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:48,739
Right?

638
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:50,809
So...

639
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:53,110
why was her necklace attached...

640
00:47:53,139 --> 00:47:54,739
- to the knife found at your house?
- Dad!

641
00:47:55,179 --> 00:47:57,409
Tell me. Why was it there?

642
00:47:57,849 --> 00:47:59,050
Explain.

643
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:07,590
Why are you closing your eyes? Open them.

644
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:10,230
Open them and talk to me.

645
00:48:11,559 --> 00:48:13,460
Right. I remember...

646
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:14,630
Please help me find my daughter.

647
00:48:14,659 --> 00:48:16,599
that you worked as hard as I did, no,

648
00:48:16,829 --> 00:48:19,599
even harder than I did
to find my daughter Soo Jin.

649
00:48:19,639 --> 00:48:20,670
Yes. Thank you.

650
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:23,809
The police are also trying everything
to find her. We'll find her soon.

651
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:25,570
I'll go up there and hand out the flyers.

652
00:48:25,610 --> 00:48:26,880
- Okay. Thank you.
- See you later.

653
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:31,650
I know you tried even harder than I did
to find Soo Jin.

654
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:33,349
Please tell me.

655
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,219
That the girl is not my daughter Soo Jin.

656
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:39,789
Please. I'm begging you.

657
00:48:52,199 --> 00:48:54,940
I'm sorry, Man Ho.

658
00:48:56,070 --> 00:48:57,139
What?

659
00:48:58,639 --> 00:49:01,539
What are you apologizing for?

660
00:49:02,909 --> 00:49:04,110
Tell me!

661
00:49:04,610 --> 00:49:07,179
I suffered from guilt my entire life.

662
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:09,789
Please believe that one thing.

663
00:49:11,150 --> 00:49:12,219
What?

664
00:49:13,059 --> 00:49:15,360
What did you just say, you scumbag?

665
00:49:16,329 --> 00:49:18,789
Die! Die! Just die!

666
00:49:18,829 --> 00:49:21,929
Die!

667
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:02,340
Soo Jin.

668
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:23,989
(North Mujin Police Station)

669
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:30,900
Well... About your daughter...

670
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:33,599
They'll run a DNA test again.

671
00:50:34,099 --> 00:50:35,500
We'll know when the result comes out...

672
00:50:35,869 --> 00:50:38,210
if the girl buried in that grave
is Hyeon Soo...

673
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:39,710
or Jeong Man Ho's daughter.

674
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:44,480
Anyway, you did a good job. Thanks.

675
00:50:44,679 --> 00:50:45,849
Please don't say that.

676
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:51,320
- Hey, by the way...
- Yes?

677
00:50:52,219 --> 00:50:54,389
How did you find out
that Jeong Man Ho did it?

678
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:56,090
Well...

679
00:50:57,429 --> 00:50:59,800
I saw him while watching the CCTV footage.

680
00:51:02,199 --> 00:51:03,300
Oh, I see.

681
00:51:03,570 --> 00:51:05,269
- See you around.
- Good day, sir.

682
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:12,909
(North Mujin Police Station)

683
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:21,650
If I tell them that I found this
at that place,

684
00:51:22,619 --> 00:51:25,619
the fact that I have Sung Yo Han's brain
in my head will also...

685
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:31,860
(Main Building)

686
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:34,429
Officer Jung.

687
00:51:35,230 --> 00:51:36,300
Oh, Ms. Choi.

688
00:51:37,869 --> 00:51:40,139
Thank you for catching the killer.

689
00:51:43,639 --> 00:51:45,739
Why are you thanking me?

690
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:51,849
Because it helped free Detective Go?

691
00:51:53,349 --> 00:51:56,150
I think he'll resent me for that though.

692
00:51:59,389 --> 00:52:00,619
I'll get going now.

693
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:11,130
Oh, wow. Officer Goo, you look like
a different person in that suit.

694
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:12,530
I carefully chose it.

695
00:52:13,469 --> 00:52:16,570
I'm going to have dinner
with my parents-in-law.

696
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:21,010
You already call them your parents-in-law
when you haven't even gotten married.

697
00:52:21,579 --> 00:52:23,039
You're in the prime of your life.

698
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:26,920
Oh, right. By the way, about Mr. Kim...

699
00:52:27,219 --> 00:52:28,949
I heard he was wrongfully convicted.

700
00:52:29,219 --> 00:52:31,920
I know. Everyone thinks that's true.

701
00:52:31,949 --> 00:52:35,059
But what can we do? His case has already
been decided by the Supreme Court.

702
00:52:35,559 --> 00:52:37,659
We have a situation at Room 28 in 3H.

703
00:52:37,690 --> 00:52:40,199
- An inmate is causing a ruckus.
- Room 28 in 3H?

704
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:41,900
Correctional Rapid Patrol Team,
respond to the scene.

705
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:44,599
You jerk.

706
00:52:47,139 --> 00:52:49,539
I told you not to side
with that scum, didn't I?

707
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:53,309
Why would you side with that jerk
who killed 10 innocent women?

708
00:52:53,739 --> 00:52:55,679
Put that down. Put it down now!

709
00:52:56,510 --> 00:52:58,179
Calm down, okay?

710
00:52:58,280 --> 00:52:59,920
- Be careful.
- I'll kill you.

711
00:53:00,449 --> 00:53:03,050
Everyone in the prison knows...

712
00:53:03,150 --> 00:53:05,050
that he didn't kill those people.

713
00:53:05,389 --> 00:53:08,519
Please stop harassing him!

714
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:09,860
I'm going to kill you!

715
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:12,730
Die, you scum!

716
00:53:13,090 --> 00:53:14,730
- Don't move!
- Stay still!

717
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,900
- I said, stay still!
- Don't move!

718
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,670
Thank you for catching the killer.

719
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:30,610
Did I really like her...

720
00:53:31,510 --> 00:53:33,050
without letting Dong Goo know?

721
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:35,320
Oh my gosh.

722
00:53:35,349 --> 00:53:36,989
Hey, my friend Jung Ba Reum.

723
00:53:37,019 --> 00:53:38,789
Gosh. You reek of alcohol.

724
00:53:39,519 --> 00:53:40,889
Hey, I had a bad day.

725
00:53:40,989 --> 00:53:42,489
It really was.

726
00:53:42,519 --> 00:53:44,559
Hey, why did you drink so much?

727
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:46,289
Did you fight with Seul Gi again?

728
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:50,230
Wait. What's this? Did you get hurt?

729
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:52,000
Oh, it was that minion.

730
00:53:52,199 --> 00:53:53,900
The minion of a gang boss
I told you about before.

731
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:56,570
Right. You said he kept harassing
his cellmate called Mr. Kim.

732
00:53:56,639 --> 00:54:00,179
He harassed Mr. Kim again,

733
00:54:00,309 --> 00:54:02,710
and cut another cellmate's arm
who tried to stop him.

734
00:54:04,179 --> 00:54:05,679
- Oh, it's his blood.
- Yes.

735
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:08,949
He was convicted of assault and battery,
but he's a good man.

736
00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:12,489
It happened while he was trying to
catch the man who raped his daughter.

737
00:54:13,519 --> 00:54:16,289
Oh, man. Is he injured badly?

738
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:18,260
Fortunately, it's not serious.

739
00:54:19,059 --> 00:54:22,530
Anyway, Mr. Kim, that old man,

740
00:54:22,699 --> 00:54:26,429
head-butted that gangster with a weapon
without hesitating.

741
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:28,699
What was I doing when it happened?

742
00:54:30,210 --> 00:54:31,340
Nothing.

743
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,110
I was so afraid...

744
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:38,250
I might get hurt.

745
00:54:38,349 --> 00:54:40,480
You're only human. Of course, you were...

746
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:45,389
Chi Gook wouldn't have been
a coward like me.

747
00:54:50,090 --> 00:54:51,389
Chi Gook.

748
00:54:57,199 --> 00:54:59,530
Gosh. I'm late.

749
00:54:59,570 --> 00:55:00,670
Why didn't you wake me up?

750
00:55:01,070 --> 00:55:02,170
I'm off.

751
00:55:02,199 --> 00:55:03,710
- Are you leaving already?
- Yes.

752
00:55:03,769 --> 00:55:04,769
Bye.

753
00:55:15,619 --> 00:55:16,690
Oh my...

754
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:19,090
In order to confirm the truth,
the police decided...

755
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:22,960
to collect DNA from the remains
with the consent of the bereaved,

756
00:55:22,989 --> 00:55:24,659
and send it
to the National Forensic Service.

757
00:55:24,929 --> 00:55:26,929
Everyone is wondering...

758
00:55:27,030 --> 00:55:29,199
if the remains in the grave
belong to the victim.

759
00:55:31,130 --> 00:55:33,800
He was going to kill Han Seo Joon
and become a murderer.

760
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:35,940
He knew he couldn't involve you...

761
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,739
I mean, he decided he shouldn't.

762
00:55:37,809 --> 00:55:41,010
He was going to confess his love
for you that very day.

763
00:55:50,519 --> 00:55:51,590
I'm sorry.

764
00:55:55,989 --> 00:55:58,929
When I asked you
to find Han Seo Joon's son,

765
00:55:59,659 --> 00:56:02,199
why did you pretend you didn't know
anything about him?

766
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:05,230
Were you afraid I might hurt your lover?

767
00:56:08,869 --> 00:56:12,710
If you cared about me even just
a little bit, you wouldn't have...

768
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:14,539
dated that scum, right?

769
00:56:16,949 --> 00:56:18,280
I'm sorry, Go Mu Chi.

770
00:56:21,579 --> 00:56:23,280
Why was it Sung Yo Han out of all people?

771
00:56:23,849 --> 00:56:27,190
I mean, there are so many other men.

772
00:56:27,690 --> 00:56:29,519
Then why did you pick him?

773
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:32,429
What made you so crazy about him?

774
00:56:33,159 --> 00:56:34,230
Because he was similar.

775
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:36,800
Similar? Similar to whom?

776
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:41,400
He was very similar to me.

777
00:56:42,269 --> 00:56:43,400
That's why I was attracted to him.

778
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:52,409
What on earth about him was
so similar to you?

779
00:56:53,679 --> 00:56:55,920
What is it? Did you kill someone
just like he did?

780
00:56:57,690 --> 00:56:58,889
Is that what you two have in common?

781
00:57:01,619 --> 00:57:03,789
Get lost. You're ruining my appetite.

782
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:10,300
Get your hands off of me!

783
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:12,969
Don't you dare touch me!

784
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:37,329
It has been found that the killer
of Suspect A of the knot murders...

785
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:41,030
wasn't the active detective,
but the suspect's close friend B.

786
00:57:41,530 --> 00:57:44,070
It is believed that Suspect A
murdered his friend B's daughter...

787
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:46,469
who went missing 26 years ago.

788
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:49,940
The police will investigate B
to find out his motive,

789
00:57:50,070 --> 00:57:52,340
and request for an arrest warrant.

790
00:58:01,650 --> 00:58:03,179
The victim almost died.

791
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:04,949
Why did you do that to your friend?

792
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:06,349
A friend?

793
00:58:06,619 --> 00:58:08,789
Who would make friends
with Headhunter's son?

794
00:58:10,059 --> 00:58:11,329
Whose son is he again?

795
00:58:14,599 --> 00:58:20,940
(Patient: Sung Yo Han, Nurse: Lee Sae Mi)

796
00:58:27,739 --> 00:58:29,610
No. Don't jump.

797
00:58:29,679 --> 00:58:31,449
Let go. Let go of me!

798
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:35,719
Do you feel worse than
the victims' families?

799
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:38,949
The families of
the people your dad killed.

800
00:58:41,519 --> 00:58:43,320
Even they manage to get by.

801
00:58:45,059 --> 00:58:46,389
Live and show them that...

802
00:58:47,630 --> 00:58:50,429
you're not like your father,
that you're a different person.

803
00:59:03,710 --> 00:59:04,750
Move it.

804
00:59:05,809 --> 00:59:07,449
- Careful.
- Be careful.

805
00:59:10,119 --> 00:59:13,389
She was bitten by a dog while
running away after filming a hidden cult.

806
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:15,260
You're insane.

807
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:17,289
- That hurts!
- It won't kill you.

808
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:21,099
You have no idea.
People have died from dog bites.

809
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:24,900
I saw you somewhere.

810
00:59:28,469 --> 00:59:29,670
Don't you remember me?

811
00:59:30,510 --> 00:59:32,769
You don't remember
your lifesaver? I'm hurt.

812
00:59:34,139 --> 00:59:36,980
I'm Choi Hong Ju,
OBN's current affairs producer.

813
00:59:49,789 --> 00:59:51,059
Thank you.

814
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:16,480
The killer of the suspect of
the knot murders...

815
01:00:16,550 --> 01:00:19,150
wasn't a detective
but the suspect's acquaintance...

816
01:00:19,219 --> 01:00:22,260
- I'm back.
- My goodness.

817
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:24,960
The people's hero,
Officer Jung. Well done.

818
01:00:25,090 --> 01:00:26,289
You caught the killer.

819
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:28,400
Well, I can't take the credit.

820
01:00:30,429 --> 01:00:31,599
Let me do it.

821
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:32,670
No way.

822
01:00:32,730 --> 01:00:34,739
Not the people's hero. I'll do it.

823
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:37,340
No, let me. I'll do it.

824
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:39,469
Excuse me.

825
01:00:40,909 --> 01:00:43,409
The man living upstairs
cursed my sister and...

826
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:44,980
followed her to our front door.

827
01:00:45,050 --> 01:00:47,519
What if he'd followed her inside?

828
01:00:47,650 --> 01:00:50,179
We sent officers out last time to check,

829
01:00:50,489 --> 01:00:52,719
and he said he was at home.

830
01:00:53,449 --> 01:00:55,719
Are you saying that I lied, then?

831
01:00:55,789 --> 01:00:57,360
Oh, of course not.

832
01:00:58,130 --> 01:01:00,360
There are cameras
you can put on your door.

833
01:01:00,429 --> 01:01:02,429
Why not put up a security camera?

834
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:05,699
How can we afford that
when we live from hand to mouth?

835
01:01:08,869 --> 01:01:11,840
We'll be sure to
patrol the area more often.

836
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:13,309
Right, Officer Jung?

837
01:01:14,639 --> 01:01:17,179
Yes. We'll do our best...

838
01:01:17,849 --> 01:01:19,079
to do that.

839
01:01:20,679 --> 01:01:23,219
Officer Jung, are you okay?
What are you doing?

840
01:01:27,190 --> 01:01:28,219
Excuse me.

841
01:02:39,159 --> 01:02:40,360
(I brought food. Eat regularly.)

842
01:02:40,429 --> 01:02:42,929
Your photo from kindergarten
that you asked for.

843
01:02:48,940 --> 01:02:50,510
It wasn't me.

844
01:02:55,010 --> 01:02:56,380
It wasn't my memory.

845
01:02:56,909 --> 01:02:58,349
It was Sung Yo Han's.

846
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:02,119
(Pyeongan Substation)

847
01:03:02,179 --> 01:03:03,989
- Hello.
- Hello.

848
01:03:04,150 --> 01:03:06,190
Is Officer Jung Ba Reum...

849
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:08,320
He didn't look too well,

850
01:03:08,389 --> 01:03:10,260
so our chief told him to go home.

851
01:03:10,989 --> 01:03:13,929
- Did he? Thank you.
- Sure. Bye.

852
01:03:34,619 --> 01:03:36,849
A bad brain has been placed
in this mouse's head.

853
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:39,920
If you let it live,
it might bite you to death too.

854
01:03:51,530 --> 01:03:53,130
A bad brain.

855
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:58,309
Sung Yo Han's brain in me...

856
01:04:01,710 --> 01:04:02,739
Be quiet.

857
01:04:04,150 --> 01:04:05,380
I said be quiet!

858
01:04:16,989 --> 01:04:18,989
Detective. Why are you here this late?

859
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:22,059
You punk.

860
01:04:23,030 --> 01:04:24,170
What are you?

861
01:04:25,230 --> 01:04:27,239
Tell me. What are you?

862
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:31,809
Why did you have so much to drink?

863
01:04:33,210 --> 01:04:34,280
Who...

864
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:36,809
Who told you to catch the killer?

865
01:04:37,610 --> 01:04:39,210
You idiot.

866
01:04:40,619 --> 01:04:43,550
Darn it. How long will you go on whining?

867
01:04:44,949 --> 01:04:46,489
That's so childish.

868
01:04:49,219 --> 01:04:50,260
What?

869
01:04:54,329 --> 01:04:55,829
What do you know?

870
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:58,030
Did you see your family die?

871
01:04:58,670 --> 01:05:01,340
Did your family die before your eyes?

872
01:05:17,289 --> 01:05:18,889
This is all your fault...

873
01:05:20,119 --> 01:05:21,519
Go Mu Chi.

874
01:06:21,050 --> 01:06:23,519
(Mouse)

875
01:06:23,579 --> 01:06:26,920
Father Go's crucifix pendant and
Bong Yi's grandmother's brooch were here.

876
01:06:27,019 --> 01:06:29,690
But when I went to get Officer Nam,
they had gone.

877
01:06:29,789 --> 01:06:30,789
Officer Jung.

878
01:06:30,889 --> 01:06:33,829
Aren't you too fixated that
someone else killed Sung Yo Han's victims?

879
01:06:34,260 --> 01:06:37,260
The congestion on the bone
is crucial evidence.

880
01:06:37,699 --> 01:06:39,570
Did you go to medical school?

881
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:42,670
What a jerk. You forgot
the date of my wedding.

882
01:06:43,539 --> 01:06:45,269
Why did I miss this?

883
01:06:45,610 --> 01:06:47,210
The site's very stable.

884
01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:49,079
It's the work of an expert.

885
01:06:49,409 --> 01:06:50,909
The killer is someone else.
