I see its head.

13
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:49,250
Push a little harder.

14
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,520
Push. Harder. Harder.

15
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:03,130
The baby. Is it okay?

16
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:06,540
Well done.

17
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:11,439
How does he look so much like me?

18
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,079
He's definitely Han Seo Joon junior.

19
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:19,750
Here. You should hold him too.

20
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:20,920
He's our son.

21

(Mouse)

22
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,969
Did you have a bad dream?

23
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,709
A bad dream?

24
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,680
Why are you here?

25
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:56,420
I went to your place
to give you a receipt.

26
00:01:57,189 --> 00:01:59,090
You're lucky I found you.

27
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:01,189
If not, things could've gotten really bad.

28
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:03,459
I thought of calling the police, but...

29
00:02:05,329 --> 00:02:07,670
He's your son, isn't he?

30
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,939
You got it wrong.

31
00:02:14,169 --> 00:02:17,810
You only saw him
trying to stop me from harming myself.

32
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,080
So you can't call the police.

33
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,879
Okay? You can't.

34
00:02:25,219 --> 00:02:26,949
Okay, then. Thank you.

35
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,490
My phone.

36
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:33,159
I have it.

37
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,689
Here you go.

38
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:42,870
(Mom)

39
00:03:03,219 --> 00:03:04,919
Ba Reum. Ba Reum.

40
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,159
Ba Reum.

41
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:09,689
Ba Reum, are you okay?

42
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:13,330
Ba Reum. Ba Reum, wake up. Ba Reum.

43
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:16,669
We have two people seriously hurt.
Send an ambulance, quick.

44
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:18,870
- The address is...
- Wake up.

45
00:03:19,469 --> 00:03:22,439
- Gudong-ro 356-4.
- Mr. Go.

46
00:03:22,509 --> 00:03:25,080
- Mr. Go, help him.
- Green gate, on the roof.

47
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,810
What should I do?

48
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,020
Where's Han Guk? Where is Han Guk?

49
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,719
- Han...
- Yes, Han Guk.

50
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,250
Where is he, punk?

51
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,330
What?

52
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,530
He's...

53
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,669
No.

54
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:51,099
You scumbag. Wake up!

55
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,669
Where is the boy?

56
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:56,909
Around 9pm today, a police officer
and the Mujin serial murderer...

57
00:03:56,979 --> 00:03:58,780
got into a brawl.

58
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:01,449
Both of them received severe injuries
and have been taken to the hospital.

59
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:04,120
Breaking news. The man in his 20s
who had gotten into a brawl...

60
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:07,689
with the Mujin serial murderer,
who called himself the deity,

61
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,389
was identified as Officer Jung Ba Reum
from Gudong Substation.

62
00:04:10,789 --> 00:04:12,189
You can't enter. Block her.

63
00:04:13,189 --> 00:04:14,330
Wait.

64
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:17,759
He needs surgery. Bring him in.

65
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,769
Mr. Jung Ba Reum is headed to the OR.

66
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:23,639
Officer Jung is in a critical state
after getting hit in the head...

67
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:25,500
by the killer.

68
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:27,910
He's the key witness of the Gudong
Elderly Woman Murder Case.

69
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,910
The police believe that the killer...

70
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:32,579
broke into his house to stop him
from testifying.

71
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,310
This is the frontal lobe.

72
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:38,250
There are serious compound
depressed skull fractures.

73
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:41,550
He's in such a critical state that
he can't even respond to pain.

74
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:43,220
I can't guarantee anything.

75
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:45,689
What about Sung Yo Han?

76
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:48,589
The bullet penetrated his abdomen.
His small intestine and other organs...

77
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,060
are critically damaged.

78
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,860
It's going to be a tough fight
for him as well.

79
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:56,100
Still, we should monitor them
post-surgery.

80
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:05,509
Sung Yo Han. Where is Sung Yo Han?

81
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:08,180
- Sorry?
- Where is my son?

82
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:11,819
He was in a critical state, so he had
to receive surgery immediately.

83
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,750
Please calm down, ma'am.
First, we need your signature.

84
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:16,990
How bad is his condition? How bad?

85
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,920
I'm afraid I can't say.

86
00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:33,300
Did you shoot him?

87
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:37,779
My poor son.

88
00:05:39,709 --> 00:05:41,379
Did you shoot...

89
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,750
my poor kid?

90
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:48,389
"Poor"?

91
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:50,990
Your son?

92
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,519
Then what about Officer Jung?

93
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:56,759
Your son crushed his skull and brain
with a hammer,

94
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,629
and he's about to die.

95
00:05:59,629 --> 00:06:01,199
And yet, you pity your son?

96
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:18,779
What was he thinking?

97
00:06:20,449 --> 00:06:21,620
What?

98
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:32,430
("Headhunter, the Murderer,
Like Father, Like Son?")

99
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:46,879
What about Han Guk?

100
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:48,579
Did you locate the boy?

101
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:55,649
- Did you?
- No.

102
00:06:56,089 --> 00:06:58,319
We searched Sung Yo Han's house
and all the areas around it,

103
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,060
but we couldn't find him.

104
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:04,500
He must've moved him elsewhere back then.

105
00:07:05,829 --> 00:07:06,959
Back when?

106
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,870
Detective Shin and I...

107
00:07:08,899 --> 00:07:11,399
stopped his car once
and searched his trunk.

108
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:12,800
But the boy wasn't there.

109
00:07:13,269 --> 00:07:14,439
I think I found him.

110
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,620
Gosh.

111
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,560
Give me that.

112
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:40,199
He must have swapped cars here.

113
00:07:40,329 --> 00:07:42,430
Locate the big road that this one
leads to and check the CCTV.

114
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:44,399
Let's look into all the cars
that were present during that time...

115
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:46,470
- and those that were bought illegally.
- Okay. Let's go.

116
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:50,509
Look into every single car
that came from this road.

117
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,810
This one too.

118
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,050
I found it.

119
00:07:54,209 --> 00:07:55,379
Let me see it on the big screen.

120
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,449
The license plate number is 10M 4219.

121
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,120
10M 4219.

122
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:04,620
Let's track it.

123
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,920
Please check all CCTV
that recorded that car.

124
00:08:09,329 --> 00:08:10,930
- That's where it disappeared.
- What is that?

125
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:12,560
Where is that? Let's see the map.

126
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:16,430
There's a nursing hospital
that was closed down 20 years ago.

127
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,550
Run.

128
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,279
Hurry.

129
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,850
Let's go.

130
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:18,429
Mu Chi, did you find something?

131
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,570
Those clothes were in the suitcase.

132
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:24,139
- This is the place.
- I'll tell the others.

133
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:36,750
What is this?

134
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:39,779
Mu Chi, come here quickly!

135
00:09:48,529 --> 00:09:49,590
Spray it.

136
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:00,539
Call the forensics team.

137
00:10:01,169 --> 00:10:03,940
Since he was with the kid,
he must've not gone far.

138
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,309
He could've disposed
the boy's body nearby.

139
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:09,450
Search the inside and the outside
of the building and also the woods.

140
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:13,049
While the key suspect
of the Mujin Serial Murders...

141
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,990
is undergoing surgery,

142
00:10:15,019 --> 00:10:18,889
the police are focusing
on locating Kim Han Guk, the missing boy.

143
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:21,429
(Isolation Unit,
Regional Emergency Center)

144
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,980
They're going to give a briefing
in the lobby! Hurry! Let's go!

145
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,809
Let's go!

146
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,519
Sung Yo Han's surgery was successful.

147
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:49,389
We've removed parts of his organs
that were severely damaged.

148
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,519
We performed peritoneal irrigation...

149
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:54,490
to cleanse the contaminated areas
and debridement.

150
00:10:54,629 --> 00:10:56,690
How is Officer Jung Ba Reum doing?

151
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,460
He had brain ischemia due to
the increase in intracranial pressure.

152
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:02,200
His frontal lobe and temporal lobe
are severely damaged.

153
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:04,899
His intracranial pressure continued
to increase.

154
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,809
We performed surgery on him immediately
to prevent brain herniation.

155
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,509
Due to the severity
of the cerebral hemorrhage,

156
00:11:09,539 --> 00:11:11,110
we left some
of the damaged brain tissues...

157
00:11:11,139 --> 00:11:12,639
and finished the surgery.

158
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,080
- How could this happen?
- No way.

159
00:11:20,419 --> 00:11:23,490
Your son crushed his skull and brain
with a hammer,

160
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,289
and he's about to die.

161
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:29,090
I felt sorry for you...

162
00:11:29,129 --> 00:11:31,000
since you were tormented
for being the son of a murderer.

163
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:34,470
Every time I saw you,
you had reminded me of myself.

164
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:37,600
That's why...

165
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,539
Even in death, you'll never be forgiven
for what you did.

166
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:49,179
This is the most I can do for you.

167
00:11:51,149 --> 00:11:53,419
While Kim Han Guk has yet to be found,

168
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,750
Officer Jung's surgery
had to be cut short...

169
00:11:55,789 --> 00:11:58,460
due to his critical condition.

170
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,830
Due to this incident, the public outrage
toward the government...

171
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,490
has grown immensely.

172
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:06,929
The survey showed
that the President's approval rating...

173
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,830
had dropped 40 percent
compared to last month.

174
00:12:10,299 --> 00:12:13,000
The biggest reason for this...

175
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:15,409
was due to how the government
handled the Mujin Serial Murders.

176
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,409
The ruling party's approval rating
is at an all-time low.

177
00:14:37,179 --> 00:14:38,620
With the presidential election
a year away,

178
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:40,879
the entire country is wondering
if the ruling party will...

179
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:43,690
keep its hold on power
or the opposition party will...

180
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,360
reclaim the power
as they've been hoping for long.

181
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:47,690
- It is believed...
- A delivery arrived...

182
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:49,090
for you.

183
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,460
Who sent it?

184
00:14:50,529 --> 00:14:52,960
Well... The sender's name is not
written on it.

185
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,340
This is why it's important
to keep up with the progress...

186
00:15:03,409 --> 00:15:05,779
and see how this will all pan out
for the next year.

187
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,149
(FPC, M16-389-EX)

188
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:14,220
The swelling in Officer Jung Ba Reum's
brain has subsided slightly.

189
00:15:15,889 --> 00:15:18,919
After a discussion with the neurologists,

190
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:23,289
we decided to go with another surgery.

191
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,440
- Where is my boy...
- You can't go in there.

192
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,169
I just want to ask him where my child is.

193
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,440
- Please come.
- No!

194
00:15:36,509 --> 00:15:38,379
- Come with us.
- Let go!

195
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,509
Please calm down.

196
00:15:58,929 --> 00:16:00,759
Ba Reum is dying.

197
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:02,799
But you survived?

198
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,480
Die. Just die, you scum!

199
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:29,590
(Ba Reum, I wish you happiness.)

200
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,570
(I want to become a police officer
like Uncle Ba Reum!)

201
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,970
(I hope you get well soon
and live a rosy life.)

202
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:43,809
(Mujin University Hospital)

203
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,710
The surgery was successful.

204
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:50,080
On top of the brain damage...

205
00:16:50,149 --> 00:16:52,120
caused by
compound depressed skull fractures,

206
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:54,019
the patient had signs
of secondary brain damage...

207
00:16:54,049 --> 00:16:55,590
due to increased intracranial pressure,

208
00:16:55,649 --> 00:16:57,190
and thus, he was in a critical condition.

209
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,659
We'll keep checking his condition
and carry out a few more surgeries.

210
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,830
That's all.

211
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:05,099
Now, it's out of our hands.

212
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:08,569
He needs everyone's sincere prayer
more than ever.

213
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,900
- What's the matter?
- Did the surgery go wrong?

214
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:14,440
Is Officer Jung's condition critical?

215
00:17:14,539 --> 00:17:16,809
Patient Sung Yo Han has died.

216
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:21,109
The immediate cause of his death is...

217
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:23,650
acute septic shock.

218
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:28,650
During his surgery,

219
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,049
we removed the contaminated parts
of the organs as much as possible,

220
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:33,859
but it is presumed that he had a shock
caused by an intra-abdominal infection,

221
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,359
which caused his death.

222
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,970
He should've told us where Han Guk is
before he died!

223
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:56,509
Officer Jung Ba Reum who underwent
three major surgeries...

224
00:17:56,579 --> 00:17:58,349
hasn't regained his consciousness
10 days after the last surgery.

225
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,880
The whole nation is worried.

226
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:04,660
While many people pray
that he will wake up soon,

227
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,559
and hold rallies to pray for him
across the country,

228
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:12,460
many have shared stories
of Officer Jung's good deeds.

229
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:15,200
(Wake up! Our dear public servant!)

230
00:18:15,269 --> 00:18:17,130
(How could this happen? Get well soon!
I hope you get well soon.)

231
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:19,069
(Officer Jung, thank you.)

232
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:23,940
Animals aren't allowed
in a hospital room in any circumstances.

233
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,609
But the director made an exception
for Officer Jung Ba Reum.

234
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,549
Ba Reum.

235
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,759
You can hear Eo Beong Yi, right?

236
00:18:40,089 --> 00:18:43,130
Eo Beong Yi is hoping
you wake up soon too.

237
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:49,269
Hear Eo Beong Yi chirping
and wake up soon.

238
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,170
Okay?

239
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,730
Mr. Go, I'm really fine.

240
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,269
You're not fine at all, you brat.

241
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:24,599
Look at yourself. You look like
you will collapse shortly.

242
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:26,470
I don't care if I collapse.

243
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,140
Because of me, Ba Reum is...

244
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:32,309
Ba Reum... Ba Reum...

245
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:36,180
Bong Yi.

246
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,119
It wasn't your fault.

247
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,220
So don't blame yourself.

248
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:43,250
The doctor said
that the surgery went well.

249
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,960
He'll wake up soon. All right?

250
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:52,430
Come on. Lie down. Take off your shoes.

251
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,630
- Yes.
- Excuse me.

252
00:20:07,509 --> 00:20:09,809
Get some sleep,
and don't think about anything.

253
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,920
- Mr. Go.
- Yes? Why?

254
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:22,789
Thank you.

255
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,559
Had it not been for you,

256
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,630
Ba Reum would have died.

257
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:30,970
And...

258
00:20:32,539 --> 00:20:34,670
for pulling yourself together.

259
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,910
Go to sleep, you brat.

260
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,119
(Sung Yo Han)

261
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:03,230
How should I pay for all my sins?

262
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,200
How?

263
00:21:46,309 --> 00:21:47,579
What? Ba Reum?

264
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,579
Where did Eo Beong Yi go?

265
00:21:58,619 --> 00:22:00,660
- I think it's dead. Poor thing.
- I feel bad for it.

266
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:03,559
- Mom!
- Mom!

267
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:05,259
Where... Where am I?

268
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:10,069
Ba Reum. Oh, my. Ba Reum.

269
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,640
Ba Reum.

270
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,819
How many fingers am I holding up?

271
00:22:34,089 --> 00:22:35,230
Two.

272
00:22:35,289 --> 00:22:37,390
How about now? How many in total?

273
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,029
10.

274
00:22:41,869 --> 00:22:42,970
What is this?

275
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,839
A ballpoint pen.

276
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,440
What is your name?

277
00:22:57,809 --> 00:22:59,019
My name...

278
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:01,119
How old are you?

279
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,529
Who is she?

280
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:30,710
Why can't he remember anything?

281
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:34,079
His brain injury was on
the frontal and temporal lobes.

282
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,990
Right by the temporal lobe
is the hippocampus.

283
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:40,759
If the hippocampus was damaged,
it could cause memory loss.

284
00:23:41,529 --> 00:23:43,960
He seems to be able to
process things ordinarily,

285
00:23:44,259 --> 00:23:47,500
so I think it's a temporary shock
caused by brain surgery.

286
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:50,430
Brain surgery is delicate and extensive,

287
00:23:50,569 --> 00:23:54,440
so it could take a while until
his brain can cope properly.

288
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:56,839
Ba Reum.

289
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,680
Do you really not remember me?

290
00:24:01,809 --> 00:24:02,980
Nothing at all?

291
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,049
Who is she?

292
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,150
Don't give me that strange look.

293
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,119
To me, you were...

294
00:24:14,829 --> 00:24:17,029
so sweet and kind.

295
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,670
I'm tired. I want to sleep.

296
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,980
To congratulate Officer Jung Ba Reum
on his discharge...

297
00:24:40,049 --> 00:24:43,920
after three brain surgeries after fighting
a serial killer who gravely injured him,

298
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:47,589
people from all over the country
gathered outside the hospital.

299
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:48,759
- That's him.
- He's here.

300
00:24:48,789 --> 00:24:50,359
- Officer Jung!
- He's coming out.

301
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:53,759
Thank you.

302
00:24:58,269 --> 00:24:59,339
I'm sorry.

303
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:01,369
Excuse us.

304
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,210
Thank you.

305
00:25:10,849 --> 00:25:11,950
Sit over there.

306
00:25:15,849 --> 00:25:17,089
Get some rest.

307
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:18,990
- I'll make some porridge.
- Okay.

308

I must've been a good person.

313
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,750
That's an understatement.

314
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:54,319
Since you were a kid, you were good
and you never caused any trouble.

315
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:56,190
You still are, Ba Reum.

316
00:25:56,329 --> 00:25:59,000
You're a good and upright person.

317
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:03,329
That's a relief.

That's your 100th-day photo.

320
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,420
Where's my mom?

321
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:24,019
When you were young,
she died in an accident on a rainy day.

322
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:31,460
How can I not remember a thing?

323
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,630
They say it's because
you had a few huge surgeries.

324
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:36,529
The doctor says you don't have to worry.

325
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:40,769
Your memory will come back slowly,
so you're not to be impatient.

326
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:43,910
Okay.

327
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,410
You should move soon.

328
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:49,650
You should've moved out already
because of the redevelopment.

329
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:56,019
I can't let you live alone
in that chilling house.

330
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:03,859
You must say you misfired.

331
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:06,160
You aimed for his leg and missed.

332
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,069
And you. Say you have a niece or nephew
Han Guk's age and thought of them.

333
00:27:10,099 --> 00:27:11,470
I don't have a niece or nephew.

334
00:27:11,569 --> 00:27:14,000
I'm a precious only child
that was born 10 years into the marriage.

335
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:15,509
Just say you have one.

336
00:27:15,539 --> 00:27:17,869
- It's to avoid getting penalized.
- Okay.

337
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:20,640
Did you have to go and do everything
this troublemaker told you to?

338
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,509
And acting up because your dad's powerful.

339
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:25,119
Come in.

340
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:31,420
I have a nephew that is Han Guk's age,

341
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:34,660
and I acted out because
I thought of him. I'm sorry.

342
00:27:36,289 --> 00:27:39,259
Detective Go Mu Chi, why didn't you
shoot the suspect's leg first?

343
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:41,799
The blank is a warning shot,
then you aim for the leg.

344
00:27:41,829 --> 00:27:43,299
Don't you know the rules?

345
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:52,740
The suspect was beating an officer
with a blunt weapon.

346
00:27:52,779 --> 00:27:54,640
If he'd stuck to the weapon manual,

347
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:57,049
Officer Jung Ba Reum would not be alive.

348
00:27:58,049 --> 00:27:59,779
Speak for yourself, Detective Go.

349
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,349
You misfired, right?

350
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:06,019
You aimed for his leg and missed.

351
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,630
It wasn't a misfire.

352
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:11,730
I shot with the intent to kill.

353
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,299
Investigate me for murder.

354
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:18,099
You crazy jerk...

355
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:22,470
Here's the ruling on
Sergeant Go Mu Chi's disciplinary hearing.

356
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:26,240
You discharged your weapon
in urgent circumstances to save a life.

357
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:28,980
You are cleared of suspicion.

358
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:31,609
What do you mean?

359
00:28:32,549 --> 00:28:35,319
- I killed a man.
- Mu Chi.

360
00:28:35,349 --> 00:28:36,990
I shot to kill.

361
00:28:37,089 --> 00:28:40,160
- Don't you get it? It was deliberate.
- What are you doing?

362
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:43,660
- I shot him to kill him!
- Sergeant Go is suspended for a year,

363
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:46,299
with docked pay for 6 months.
Corporal Shin, docked pay for 2 months.

364
00:28:46,329 --> 00:28:48,730
- This disciplinary committee's dismissed.
- No, wait. Wait!

365
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,730
- Wait.
- Mu Chi.

366
00:28:51,069 --> 00:28:53,369
- What are you doing?
- Send me to where he is.

367
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,839
- To where Han Seo Joon is.
- Stop it!

368
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:57,069
- I need to go there!
- Mu Chi.

369
00:28:57,109 --> 00:28:58,269
My gosh.

370
00:28:58,309 --> 00:28:59,980
- Sir!
- Are you all right?

371
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:03,009
He's bleeding.

372
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:04,450
Gosh. Father.

373
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,490
We'll begin the surgery.
Anesthetize her, please.

374
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:09,650
Raise your head.

375
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:14,920
Choi Hong Ju, the anesthetic is going in.

376
00:29:15,859 --> 00:29:17,960
I'm sorry, baby.

377
00:29:18,859 --> 00:29:20,930
In the basement of Sung Yo Han's home,

378
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,670
we found photos of the corpse
of Byun Soon Young, the second victim.

379
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,769
Also, around the times of death
of his victims,

380
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:30,009
Sung Yo Han's phones pinged from...

381
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:32,309
cell towers near the murder sites.

382
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:35,410
Add to that
the circumstantial evidence that...

383
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:37,480
he followed witnesses
Officer Jung Ba Reum...

384
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:39,920
and a teenage girl home to kill them,

385
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,819
we concluded that Sung Yo Han is...

386
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:46,319
the Mujin serial killer who claimed
the lives of seven victims.

387
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:49,960
Ba Reum.

388
00:29:51,059 --> 00:29:53,630
Yes. I'm coming.

389
00:29:57,599 --> 00:29:58,700
Hey.

390
00:30:00,339 --> 00:30:01,839
- I'll throw these away.
- Okay.

391
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,410
I'll take this book.

392
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,009
I'm studying the same subject.

393
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:12,250
I decided to try again
to work at a prison.

394
00:30:13,049 --> 00:30:14,619
- As a guard?
- Yes.

395
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:16,890
I promised Chi Gook.

396
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:19,920
That I'd be his colleague
when he wakes up.

397
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,190
Chi... Chi Gook?

398
00:30:23,859 --> 00:30:24,930
Chi...

399
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:30,400
Chi Gook, you and I
were the three musketeers.

400
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,839
See if you need to pack anything
from the backyard.

401
00:30:42,309 --> 00:30:45,519
- That's trash. Leave it outside.
- Okay.

402
00:30:45,779 --> 00:30:46,980
Thank you.

403
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,769
Shall I load this too?

404
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,680
You can leave that.

405
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:16,180
Then we're all done.

406
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:17,480
Come on out so we can leave.

407
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:25,819
However, because Sung Yo Han is deceased,

408
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:29,730
we will inform the prosecution
that we will not indict.

409
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:31,859
Even after this is done,

410
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,599
we will continue our search
for Kim Han Guk.

411
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:13,900
Bong Yi. When you grow up, marry me.

412
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:41,859
Kang Deok Soo's sentence was reduced to
10 years as he was drunk and incompetent,

413
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,369
and he will be discharged
from prison tomorrow.

414
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:45,269
The police have strengthened
public security...

415
00:32:45,339 --> 00:32:47,640
to prevent any more incidents.

416
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,410
Residents who live around his house,
Building A in Mujin,

417
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:52,809
are already tense.

418
00:32:53,009 --> 00:32:54,640
The police have been visiting often,

419
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:57,410
and the residents are expressing...

420
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:00,279
their concerns.

421
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:02,589
Kang Deok Soo should receive
the death penalty!

422
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:04,549
- Give him the death penalty!
- Give him the death penalty!

423
00:33:04,619 --> 00:33:06,859
Keep this community safe!

424
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,490
- Keep it safe!
- Keep it safe!

425
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:10,559
- Revise his sentence!
- Oh Bong Yi... I'm sorry.

426
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:12,529
- Revise it!
- Revise it!

427
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:14,400
Keep this community safe!

428
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,529
- Keep it safe!
- Keep it safe!

429
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:18,269
Kang Deok Soo should receive
the death penalty!

430
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:20,299
- Oh Bong Yi.
- Give him the death penalty!

431
00:33:20,369 --> 00:33:22,440
- I'm sorry.
- Keep this community safe!

432
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,309
- Keep it safe!
- Keep it safe!

433
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:27,640
I'm glad she's not here.

434
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:30,579
- We're against it!
- Keep this community safe!

435
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:32,579
- Keep it safe!
- Keep it safe!

436
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:35,990
- There he is!
- Hey!

437
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:38,190
- How could you call yourself human?
- You should die!

438
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:39,519
Kill him!

439
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:42,019
Give him the death penalty!

440
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:44,259
- Hey!
- You're not even human!

441
00:33:44,329 --> 00:33:46,029
- Hey!
- You should die!

442
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:47,930
Kang Deok Soo.

443
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:52,670
You should just die!

444
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:55,339
- Hey!
- You're not even human!

445
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:57,210
Hey!

446
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,480
Officer Go?

447
00:34:00,309 --> 00:34:01,480
You have a good memory.

448
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:05,180
You're right. It's me, the one
who put you behind bars.

449
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:07,880
Why are you here?

450
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:09,489
I'm here to warn you.

451
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,920
If you do that once more, I will kill you.

452
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:16,329
I'm sorry.

453
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:19,230
I will repent for what I've done...

454
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,059
until the day I die.

455
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,530
You see,

456
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:26,440
I'm dead set on killing someone right now.

457
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:28,469
You better not forget my warning.

458
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:31,909
I'll make sure...

459
00:34:32,409 --> 00:34:34,309
to make up for everything I've done.

460
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:38,050
Hey!

461
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,579
- You should die!
- Hey!

462
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,449
Kill him!

463
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:43,449
- Kill him!
- Where do you think you're going?

464
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:45,760
- Kill him!
- Hey!

465
00:34:46,289 --> 00:34:47,989
You should die!

466
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,590
Kill him!

467
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:52,900
Where did you disappear to, Bong Yi?

468
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:55,000
Repent!

469
00:34:56,369 --> 00:34:58,869
The presidential election campaign
for the 20th president...

470
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,940
will begin today.

471
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,440
Lee Kyung Seon from the ruling party,
Gukseon Party...

472
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:25,230
- Our Lee Kyung Seon
- Number one

473
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:26,960
- Number one, Lee Kyung Seon
- Hey!

474
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:29,030
- Let me sleep, will you?
- Our Lee Kyung Seon

475
00:35:29,269 --> 00:35:30,900
- Our Lee Kyung Seon
- Number one

476
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:34,869
- Lee Kyung Seon from Gukseon Party
- It's too early in the morning for this!

477
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:37,139
- We have prepared this for you
- Number one

478
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:40,139
- Number one, Lee Kyung Seon
- Lee Kyung Seon

479
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:43,579
Yap all you want.

480
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:46,280
I'm going to vote for the one
who brings back the death penalty.

481
00:35:56,329 --> 00:35:57,429
Yes?

482
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:59,429
Did you take a nice year-long vacation?

483
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:01,099
You have been appointed to a station.

484
00:36:01,929 --> 00:36:03,030
Where to?

485
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:11,039
Detective Shin, you've suffered so much,
being all cooped up in here.

486
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,610
Those cheap scumbags.

487
00:36:13,739 --> 00:36:17,409
It wasn't even intentional.
It was just the superintendent's chin.

488
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,550
How could they send me here for a year?

489
00:36:22,219 --> 00:36:24,920
Anyway, once I rejoin
the Serious Crime Team,

490
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:27,159
I won't need to wear this anymore.

491
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:30,760
Farewell, Pyeongan Substation.

492
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:36,730
Hello, I'll be working with you
from today on.

493
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,099
My name is Officer Jung Ba Reum.

494
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:41,170
Officer Jung.

495
00:36:41,539 --> 00:36:43,510
I did hear that you'd be replacing me.

496
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:44,940
- I hope we get along.
- Likewise.

497
00:36:45,909 --> 00:36:49,179
Our mascot is finally here.

498
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:54,820
Officer Nam, what are you doing? Bring it.

499
00:36:56,389 --> 00:36:58,150
You do know that the citizens
are rooting for you, right?

500
00:36:58,349 --> 00:37:01,360
Take your time to adjust.
Don't overwork yourself. Got it?

501
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,760
- I'll do my best.
- No, don't do that.

502
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,599
Drink this. It's herbal medicine.

503
00:37:08,929 --> 00:37:10,469
- Sit down.
- Yes, sir.

504
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,269
Put that down for now and follow me.

505
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,670
I have so much to teach you.

506
00:37:14,739 --> 00:37:17,139
No. Rest up. Sit down and drink that.

507
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:20,039
What are you doing?
I need to teach him before I leave.

508
00:37:20,139 --> 00:37:23,010
The higher-ups have told me
that he's not completely recovered.

509
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:25,650
- He needs more rest.
- What? I thought he recovered.

510
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:26,750
Then why is he here?

511
00:37:26,849 --> 00:37:28,849
The presidential election
is around the corner.

512
00:37:29,219 --> 00:37:32,289
The public desperately prayed
that he'd survive.

513
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:35,190
He needs to return to work...

514
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:37,789
and show everyone
that he's doing just fine.

515
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:40,659
Then the ruling party's approval rating
will skyrocket...

516
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:42,369
and remain that way.

517
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:44,570
I'm sorry to say this.

518
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:45,699
What is it?

519
00:37:45,769 --> 00:37:48,800
He shouldn't overwork himself,
so don't give him any work.

520
00:37:48,869 --> 00:37:50,010
Just let him be.

521
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:53,639
Let him do whatever he wants.
If he wants to go home, let him.

522
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:56,710
If he doesn't show up for work,
just ignore it. Please?

523
00:37:56,809 --> 00:37:58,780
What a comfortable life he'll have.

524
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:01,619
Officer Nam will be the only one
working like a dog.

525
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:04,750
Being loved by the public
sure has many privileges.

526
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:14,099
So have you regained all of your memory?

527
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,360
Yes.

528
00:38:15,429 --> 00:38:17,300
Some parts are a bit blurry,

529
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:19,340
but I remember most of them.

530
00:38:19,639 --> 00:38:22,070
That's a relief.
Then you must remember Detective Go.

531
00:38:24,039 --> 00:38:26,139
Dong Goo did tell me a lot about him.

532
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:28,639
But I haven't recalled anything just yet.

533
00:38:28,809 --> 00:38:31,380
Gosh. How could you not remember him?

534
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,949
He's definitely not normal.

535
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:35,989
- Sorry?
- What?

536
00:38:36,449 --> 00:38:38,750
I heard you live nearby.

537
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:42,090
Yes. I live behind that apartment.

538
00:38:42,329 --> 00:38:44,289
My aunt wanted me
to live somewhere near her.

539
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,659
So your aunt lives here as well.

540
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,630
By the way, I wonder if I've returned
to work too soon.

541
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,670
I'm worried I might become
an inconvenience.

542
00:38:54,869 --> 00:38:56,539
You're right.

543
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,570
I'll be leaving soon,

544
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:00,880
- but Officer Nam will be suffering...
- Wait.

545
00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:02,210
What is it?

546
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:04,079
Can you pull up over here?

547
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:08,550
(Shin Sung Min)

548
00:39:08,619 --> 00:39:10,489
Who did this?

549
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,789
Why would he run for president
and be humiliated like this?

550
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:15,730
I'm going to vote for him.

551
00:39:16,489 --> 00:39:18,889
- What?
- I had so much free time at home,

552
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:22,530
so I listened to all their speeches
and the promises they've made.

553
00:39:22,769 --> 00:39:25,269
I found him to be the only one
who sounded truthful...

554
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:28,300
and had a firm vision about our country.

555
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,469
He's such a respectable man.

556
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,480
Thanks.

557
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:36,579
Detective Shin, what are you doing?

558
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:38,380
Just stay still. You don't need to know.

559
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:39,980
What are you doing?

560
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:42,989
- Look!
- There he goes again.

561
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:44,489
- Thief!
- Stay in the car.

562
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:46,860
My bag! What should I do?

563
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,869
Come here!

564
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,739
Come here! Gosh.

565
00:40:01,239 --> 00:40:03,840
Come here! Hey!

566
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:06,039
What? Officer Jung!

567
00:40:06,309 --> 00:40:07,579
Don't rattle your brain!

568
00:40:10,179 --> 00:40:12,010
You should stop so that I can cuff you.

569
00:40:13,849 --> 00:40:14,780
Stop!

570
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:21,389
- What's going on?
- Shouldn't we catch him?

571
00:40:38,909 --> 00:40:41,309
- Stay still!
- Let me go!

572
00:40:47,349 --> 00:40:48,679
Help me!

573
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:57,530
What is this feeling?

574
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:06,869
Don't be idle.
We have a ton of work to do.

575
00:41:07,239 --> 00:41:08,340
Do you see all that?

576
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:11,110
Organize and categorize them.

577
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,849
You want me to do this all by myself?

578
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:19,579
Do you see anyone else here?

579
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:21,719
Are we the only people working here?

580
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:24,889
The Ministry of Justice
had told the press...

581
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:27,690
that they'd be forming more teams.

582
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,260
Don't you know that the higher-ups...

583
00:41:29,329 --> 00:41:31,590
set up teams just for show
whenever something big happens...

584
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:33,500
then disband it once
the public outrage dies down?

585
00:41:33,829 --> 00:41:36,170
I'll go to the Traffic Division
of the Civil Service Center.

586
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:38,530
You're here because they refused
to have you.

587
00:41:39,739 --> 00:41:40,869
Don't they know who I am?

588
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:43,769
They know you're a troublemaker
and a ticking bomb.

589
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:46,610
Simply put, no department wants you.

590
00:41:46,679 --> 00:41:48,710
So go on and work.

591
00:41:50,849 --> 00:41:52,179
I'll just resign then.

592
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:53,650
Don't you have work to do?

593
00:41:56,719 --> 00:41:57,719
What?

594
00:42:00,489 --> 00:42:01,789
Don't you know
that the Evidence Storage Team...

595
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:04,590
are also given weapons?

596
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:09,269
- But we work indoors.
- Who said that?

597
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:12,670
You're not going to spend all day in here,
organizing evidence.

598
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:14,570
At times, we need to go
to the crime scenes ourselves...

599
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:16,269
to collect evidence.

600
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:17,510
We'll be given weapons during those times.

601
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:22,110
This could be the perfect place
to get your chance.

602
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:27,780
I have a wife I need to take care of.

603
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,849
If it wasn't for her,
I would've done it myself.

604
00:42:31,789 --> 00:42:33,460
I would've done
what you're planning to do.

605
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:42,329
There's no wallet or cell phone.

606
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:44,530
It's definitely a robbery and murder.

607
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,039
No, it's not.

608
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:49,199
Whoever did this,
made it look like a robbery.

609
00:42:49,969 --> 00:42:52,610
Who are you? Why are you spewing
such nonsense?

610
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:55,739
Hey, how do you know it's nonsense?

611
00:42:55,909 --> 00:42:58,449
- What did you say? You little...
- What?

612
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,219
- How old are you?
- I'm old enough. Why?

613
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:03,090
Detective Kang, I found a tire mark here.

614
00:43:06,659 --> 00:43:07,860
Let's go.

615
00:43:21,769 --> 00:43:23,039
It starts here and ends over there.

616
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:24,510
- Can you see it?
- Yes.

617
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,980
The national hero Officer Jung was right.

618
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:34,019
I mean, there are a tire mark...

619
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,949
and a drag mark here.

620
00:43:36,019 --> 00:43:39,219
That means the killer drove here
with the body and moved it over there.

621
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:41,159
What kind of robber would kill a person...

622
00:43:41,289 --> 00:43:43,789
and then move the body and her purse?
Wouldn't you agree?

623
00:43:43,929 --> 00:43:46,000
- Stop spewing nonsense.
- Gosh, seriously.

624
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:47,159
He has a point.

625
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:50,800
The victim's belongings are gone, but
the killer thoroughly prepared tools,

626
00:43:50,829 --> 00:43:53,940
and took her phone and wallet
to make it look like a robbery.

627
00:43:54,099 --> 00:43:57,610
Exactly. Besides, the fact that the victim
was killed with her face down...

628
00:43:57,739 --> 00:43:59,309
means that the killer knew her well.

629
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:02,239
It must be a murder over grudge
or a revenge murder.

630
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,710
Identify the victim first,
and check the people around her.

631
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:05,880
You're wrong.

632
00:44:06,619 --> 00:44:07,920
It's not a revenge murder.

633
00:44:08,179 --> 00:44:11,320
Come on. Officer Jung, stop it.
I'll talk to him.

634
00:44:11,449 --> 00:44:13,460
He had a head injury. That's why.

635
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:16,429
He's the officer who fought
with Sung Yo Han and injured his head.

636
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:19,730
Just go and secure the area
to prevent contamination of evidence.

637
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:20,900
- But it's not...
- Come with me, Officer Jung.

638
00:44:20,929 --> 00:44:22,300
All right. I heard you.

639
00:44:30,809 --> 00:44:33,409
(Headhunter Serial Murders)

640
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:00,300
(My dear Mu Chi,)

641
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:01,340
(we bought this...)

642
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:14,119
My dear Mu Chi, we bought this
limited edition Hurricane action figure...

643
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:15,880
that you've been asking us for.

644
00:45:16,449 --> 00:45:20,420
You should know that your dad had to wait
in line early in the morning to buy this.

645
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:22,659
Mu Chi, happy birthday.

646
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:26,429
If anyone bullies you,
I'll teach them all a lesson.

647
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:32,070
(If anyone bullies you,
I'll teach them all a lesson.)

648
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:48,949
I don't want to.
Let's just stay here and camp.

649
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:51,090
Please, Mom?

650
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:53,820
Go Mu Chi. I'm letting you off
because it's your birthday.

651
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:06,139
Here. Organize this too.

652
00:46:08,199 --> 00:46:11,010
Gosh. Han Seo Joon's case was already
decided even by the Supreme Court.

653
00:46:11,039 --> 00:46:12,809
Why do we still keep the evidence here?

654
00:46:14,409 --> 00:46:17,809
The prosecutors were going to
dispose of it, but I brought it here.

655
00:46:18,909 --> 00:46:20,719
The evidence of Han Seo Joon's case...

656
00:46:20,849 --> 00:46:23,750
still helps police investigations greatly.

657
00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:27,519
Keeping and organizing evidence are not
the only duties of our team.

658
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:30,460
Our major job is to collect materials
for research on crimes.

659
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:34,159
What a way to take your job. I didn't know
it was such an important team.

660
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:36,769
Then send more manpower.

661
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,329
I can't do all this alone.

662
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:39,969
No one wants to join this team.

663
00:46:40,369 --> 00:46:42,099
Bring someone here yourself.

664
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:57,690
I hope that Chi Gook will wake up soon,

665
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:01,590
and become healthy again like you did.

666
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:03,460
I'm sure he'll wake up soon.

667
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:09,429
You can't give up hope.

668
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:16,610
Here's my wedding invitation.

669
00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:18,369
Obviously, you'll be the host
of the ceremony. You know that, right?

670
00:47:18,409 --> 00:47:19,539
I can't do that.

671
00:47:19,579 --> 00:47:21,179
Come on. Who else can do it?

672
00:47:21,409 --> 00:47:23,949
Chi Gook is sick. You should do it for me.

673
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,050
Today was my first day.

674
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:30,849
I realized how upset
Chi Gook must've been.

675
00:47:31,489 --> 00:47:32,590
Was it that hard?

676
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:35,619
There's this minion of a gang boss
in the area I'm in charge of.

677
00:47:35,659 --> 00:47:37,360
He wouldn't stop harassing his cellmate.

678
00:47:37,559 --> 00:47:39,360
I mean, he's old enough
to be his grandfather.

679
00:47:39,389 --> 00:47:43,170
I thought it was too much,
so I told him to stop it.

680
00:47:43,199 --> 00:47:45,230
And then he started harassing me too.

681
00:47:46,369 --> 00:47:48,099
He calls me "Idiot Dong Goo".

682
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,340
I've been called "Porno Dong Goo",
but this is way worse.

683
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:53,880
He looked down on me because I'm a rookie,

684
00:47:53,909 --> 00:47:56,579
- so I was going to teach him a lesson...
- Did you hit him?

685
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:58,179
Have you lost your mind?

686
00:47:58,210 --> 00:47:59,449
I read his palm.

687
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,849
He was born to be a criminal.

688
00:48:02,650 --> 00:48:05,119
Gosh, you punk. You and your jokes.

689
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:08,559
Hey, you should be careful.
You might get hurt.

690
00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:12,159
I want Bong Yi to come to my wedding too.

691
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:15,030
Where did that wench go?

692
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,099
Bong Yi?

693
00:48:18,769 --> 00:48:20,570
I guess you haven't recalled anything
about her yet.

694
00:48:25,409 --> 00:48:26,739
How was your day?

695
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:28,309
Tell me how you feel
about returning to work.

696
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:33,150
I saw a dead body.

697
00:48:33,179 --> 00:48:34,250
A dead body?

698
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:37,690
- Did you pee yourself?
- Stop joking around.

699
00:48:38,389 --> 00:48:41,090
How should I put it?
It felt a little strange.

700
00:48:41,789 --> 00:48:43,760
My heart started beating fast.

701
00:48:43,789 --> 00:48:44,989
Your heart beats fast?

702
00:48:46,599 --> 00:48:48,599
You must've been really shocked.

703
00:48:48,929 --> 00:48:51,000
I remember that you said the same thing...

704
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:53,070
when you saw a dead cat.

705
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:55,099
It wasn't like that.

706
00:48:55,269 --> 00:48:56,409
It was different.

707
00:48:56,510 --> 00:48:57,570
I'm sure it felt the same.

708
00:48:57,610 --> 00:49:00,679
You felt queasy
and threw up all day long that day.

709
00:49:01,010 --> 00:49:02,579
Don't worry. I'm sure it's nothing.

710
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:04,550
- Over here.
- Hello.

711
00:49:04,579 --> 00:49:06,849
- Hello.
- Hello.

712
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,179
- Hello.
- You're here.

713
00:49:08,219 --> 00:49:09,250
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

714
00:49:11,789 --> 00:49:12,849
All right.

715
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:14,989
This is my friend whom I worked with
in the film industry.

716
00:49:15,019 --> 00:49:17,889
And this is Lawyer Woo Young Chul
who gave me legal advice for my script.

717
00:49:18,590 --> 00:49:20,829
- You all know Ba Reum, right?
- Of course, we know him.

718
00:49:21,059 --> 00:49:23,969
And this is my fiancee Kim Seul Gi.

719
00:49:24,329 --> 00:49:26,230
She played the lead role in my short film.

720
00:49:27,139 --> 00:49:29,369
- Congratulations on your wedding.
- Thank you.

721
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:32,309
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.

722
00:49:39,579 --> 00:49:41,750
- I'm going to the ladies' room.
- Okay.

723
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:44,219
Be careful.

724
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:51,230
Dong Goo, I told you, it's not too late.

725
00:49:52,130 --> 00:49:54,230
Reconsider your decision to marry her.

726
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:55,800
Enough is enough, you punk.

727
00:49:55,929 --> 00:49:58,469
She won't give up on her dream.

728
00:49:58,630 --> 00:50:01,440
Do you really think she'll be happy
living as a public servant's wife?

729
00:50:04,139 --> 00:50:07,139
If she gets an offer for a lead role,
she'll betray you right away.

730
00:50:07,179 --> 00:50:08,380
Gosh, stop it!

731
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:11,679
- Gosh, you punk. I said, enough.
- Guys.

732
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:14,849
Calm down. Hey, stop it.

733
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,420
You shouldn't say such a thing
even when you're drunk.

734
00:50:17,449 --> 00:50:20,889
Listen. Do you know what her nickname is?

735
00:50:21,590 --> 00:50:24,059
The fairy who betrayed the woodcutter.

736
00:50:24,429 --> 00:50:26,289
Everyone in the industry knows that.

737
00:50:26,329 --> 00:50:28,300
He's the only one who doesn't know.
I'm so upset.

738
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:31,929
My, he's so naive.

739
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:34,099
Pushover Dong Goo.

740
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,369
Why you little...
You cross the line whenever you're drunk.

741
00:50:38,639 --> 00:50:39,809
- You punk.
- Hey, Dong Goo.

742
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:41,840
- Dong Goo, stop it.
- Gosh. Let go!

743
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:46,750
Ba Reum, are you okay? Are you...

744
00:50:47,179 --> 00:50:49,719
- Stop it.
- Let go of me. I said, let go.

745
00:51:29,289 --> 00:51:30,460
Are you okay?

746
00:51:31,059 --> 00:51:32,190
Are you hurt?

747
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:34,760
It's just a scratch. I'm fine.

748
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:36,570
Oh, man. You scraped your forehead.

749
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:44,670
Hey, by the way, since when
did you have such a hard punch?

750
00:51:46,369 --> 00:51:48,639
You always get the lowest score
in whack-a-mole game.

751
00:51:51,110 --> 00:51:53,880
The case we'll talk about
on "Sherlock Jane Doe" today is...

752
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:58,190
the suicide of
a female college student in her 20s.

753
00:51:59,519 --> 00:52:01,619
According to the result
of the digital investigation,

754
00:52:01,789 --> 00:52:04,989
she committed suicide in her room
because of financial difficulties.

755
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:07,559
This is the evidence of the murder
at Pyeongan-dong.

756
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:08,730
Did you eat dinner?

757
00:52:09,329 --> 00:52:10,900
That rude punk.

758
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:13,769
(Mujin Metropolitan Police Agency)

759
00:52:22,110 --> 00:52:23,510
(Complete List of Evidence)

760
00:52:30,949 --> 00:52:32,050
What?

761
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:34,420
Those punks.

762
00:52:36,389 --> 00:52:39,730
Hey, there are two items of evidence
are missing in this box.

763
00:52:39,789 --> 00:52:41,199
The knotted rope and murder weapon.

764
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:42,960
Bring that over.

765
00:52:43,030 --> 00:52:44,800
We don't have time to kill.

766
00:52:45,130 --> 00:52:46,739
Bored you can come and get it.

767
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,900
What? Bored...

768
00:52:51,110 --> 00:52:52,269
He hung up on me?

769
00:52:56,179 --> 00:52:57,409
Where is he?

770
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:02,679
This is the highwayman's hitch.

771
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:06,190
It's ideal for when you're climbing
and need to tie a quick knot.

772
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:09,320
Without actually tying anything,

773
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:10,789
you can fix it quick and securely.

774
00:53:11,190 --> 00:53:13,429
Then is this dagger a hiking tool as well?

775
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:14,599
Yes, it is.

776
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,769
Then we must look for an experienced hiker
among the victim's acquaintances.

777
00:53:18,670 --> 00:53:19,869
Hang on.

778
00:53:20,469 --> 00:53:22,699
This knot is slightly modified.

779
00:53:23,070 --> 00:53:25,610
This part here shouldn't be tied this way.

780
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:26,840
It's an odd knot.

781
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:30,280
It's either a deliberate modification of
the highwayman's hitch,

782
00:53:30,849 --> 00:53:33,010
or it's a mistake due to inexperience.

783
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:37,050
So this isn't 100-percent
the high-something knot?

784
00:53:37,150 --> 00:53:38,190
Correct.

785
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:43,360
Go Mu Chi, what are you doing?

786
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:46,929
What else?

787
00:53:47,699 --> 00:53:50,000
I came for it myself
because I was told to.

788
00:53:50,469 --> 00:53:53,599
Sign the documents again
if you want to take these back.

789
00:53:53,869 --> 00:53:55,539
My gosh.

790
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,010
What was the patrol division officer
talking about?

791
00:53:59,239 --> 00:54:00,780
That the killer's not an acquaintance.

792
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:02,309
It's nonsense. Don't mind it.

793
00:54:03,309 --> 00:54:05,380
He had brain surgery and isn't normal.

794
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:08,679
Is he the guy who got hit in the head
while fighting the serial killer?

795
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:10,389
Yes.

796
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:12,550
So you're back,

797
00:54:13,559 --> 00:54:14,690
Officer Jung.

798
00:54:19,829 --> 00:54:22,199
Pyeongan Substation is...

799
00:54:23,699 --> 00:54:25,030
It's somewhere here.

800
00:54:34,309 --> 00:54:35,679
What an idiot.

801
00:54:38,110 --> 00:54:39,280
Officer Jung?

802
00:54:41,349 --> 00:54:43,449
I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.

803
00:54:43,519 --> 00:54:46,250
I was putting out some trash
and it rolled into the street.

804
00:54:47,059 --> 00:54:48,159
You must've been startled.

805
00:54:48,289 --> 00:54:49,320
I'm sorry.

806
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:51,889
You're just the same, Officer Jung.

807
00:54:53,090 --> 00:54:54,230
Do you know me?

808
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:05,469
Are you crazy? Got a death wish?

809
00:55:05,710 --> 00:55:07,739
You could've died
because of that stupid bird.

810
00:55:07,809 --> 00:55:09,940
Why? Does your head hurt?

811
00:55:12,050 --> 00:55:13,079
Detective Go Mu Chi.

812
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:16,519
Detective Go.

813
00:55:17,949 --> 00:55:19,050
Detective.

814
00:55:24,989 --> 00:55:27,059
- This is all we have.
- Thank you.

815
00:55:28,429 --> 00:55:29,429
Are you okay now?

816
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:32,030
Yes. I'm much better now
after the inpatient treatment.

817
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:35,000
If I remember something about someone,

818
00:55:35,170 --> 00:55:38,539
memories related to that person
come back in succession.

819
00:55:38,869 --> 00:55:40,440
I'm grateful that you remembered me.

820
00:55:40,610 --> 00:55:42,309
I should've remembered you sooner.

821
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:44,110
How did you know I was here?

822
00:55:44,809 --> 00:55:45,849
Was it Detective Shin?

823
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:48,780
No. I overheard
the Serious Crimes fools...

824
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,250
- badmouthing you.
- What?

825
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:54,420
That you said some nonsense about
the killer not being an acquaintance.

826
00:55:58,260 --> 00:55:59,989
Will you take a look at this?

827
00:56:03,329 --> 00:56:04,329
Right here.

828
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:05,969
This knot here.

829
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:08,869
When tied like this,
the victim can move around a lot.

830
00:56:09,239 --> 00:56:11,710
And it looks pretty easy to undo.

831
00:56:13,039 --> 00:56:14,380
Yes. They said...

832
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:17,480
this knot is called the highway-something.

833
00:56:17,650 --> 00:56:20,219
So they're looking for a hiking expert
among her acquaintances.

834
00:56:20,619 --> 00:56:23,349
If an expert knows
this knot is easy to undo,

835
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:26,019
why would they use it to tie her wrists?

836
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:28,489
Look at this.

837
00:56:30,159 --> 00:56:33,130
It shows the victim moved around a lot.

838
00:56:33,289 --> 00:56:34,460
It does.

839
00:56:35,199 --> 00:56:37,670
- Why did he use this knot?
- He enjoyed it.

840
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:40,840
- What?
- He chose it to have fun.

841
00:56:41,969 --> 00:56:44,739
The victim had hope
that she could survive,

842
00:56:45,170 --> 00:56:47,380
so she'd have struggled to undo the rope.

843
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:51,010
The killer watched that.

844
00:56:51,210 --> 00:56:54,579
If he were watching her do that,
why stab her in the back?

845
00:56:56,949 --> 00:56:58,019
Look.

846
00:56:59,949 --> 00:57:01,420
The wound is shallow.

847
00:57:03,659 --> 00:57:05,829
He stabbed enough not to kill her,

848
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:08,800
enjoyed watching her suffer,

849
00:57:09,699 --> 00:57:12,769
and in the last moment, strangled her.

850
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:17,409
That's something
only a psychopath would do.

851
00:57:17,539 --> 00:57:18,840
It's not his first kill.

852
00:57:19,969 --> 00:57:22,039
- What?
- After the first kill,

853
00:57:22,110 --> 00:57:25,280
they're too flustered or distracted
to clean up the scene.

854
00:57:25,449 --> 00:57:27,219
If you look, the scene's too clean.

855
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:29,719
Fingerprints, hair, they found nothing.

856
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:33,019
If we don't catch him quick,
there will be another murder.

857
00:57:34,889 --> 00:57:36,090
How are you so sure?

858
00:57:38,329 --> 00:57:39,429
Just because.

859
00:57:41,630 --> 00:57:42,800
I feel it.

860
00:57:43,730 --> 00:57:45,030
You feel it?

861
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:47,940
Why?

862
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:51,469
I think you've changed a bit.

863
00:57:52,369 --> 00:57:53,980
You're not like before.

864
00:57:55,909 --> 00:57:56,909
Me?

865
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:04,719
The victim had hope
that she could survive,

866
00:58:04,889 --> 00:58:06,960
so she'd have struggled to undo the rope.

867
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:11,030
He enjoyed it.

868
00:58:11,130 --> 00:58:13,230
He chose it to have fun.

869
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,869
Inspector Kang's questioning the killer.

870
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:21,800
The owner of the pub confirmed it.

871
00:58:21,869 --> 00:58:24,170
That you'd been hitting on her
for a month.

872
00:58:26,139 --> 00:58:27,210
Is that him?

873
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:31,079
These are the tire tracks
found at the scene.

874
00:58:31,809 --> 00:58:34,719
And this is a photo of your car's tire.

875
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:38,320
I really never went there.

876
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:40,889
And is my car the only one with that tire?

877
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:43,519
I think it's not him.

878
00:58:44,059 --> 00:58:45,760
How does he look like a psychopath?

879
00:58:46,489 --> 00:58:48,530
We found these when we searched your home.

880
00:58:48,599 --> 00:58:51,500
- I really did not kill her.
- I don't think it's him.

881
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:53,530
- I just like her.
- Who says the killer's a psycho?

882
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:55,000
Are all men in love killers?

883
00:58:55,070 --> 00:58:56,139
- Don't go overboard.
- The day she died,

884
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:57,940
where were you at that time?

885
00:58:59,610 --> 00:59:00,639
Well...

886
00:59:01,239 --> 00:59:03,210
Inspector, the National
Forensic Service called.

887
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:06,309
The sperm found on Kang Min Joo
matches his DNA.

888
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:08,619
See? You're the one who's wrong.

889
00:59:20,659 --> 00:59:21,659
He felt it?

890
00:59:22,059 --> 00:59:25,500
You believed a kid who isn't right
after he had brain surgery?

891
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:29,070
My gosh. Mu Chi, Mu Chi...

892
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:34,610
KFD-2019.

893
00:59:34,679 --> 00:59:38,179
On the fifth, for the murder of
a pub part-timer A,

894
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:40,820
police arrested her stalker B...

895
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,250
as the most likely suspect.

896
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:44,420
He maintains
the intercourse was consensual...

897
00:59:44,489 --> 00:59:46,719
- That guy.
- and denies the charges.

898
00:59:46,789 --> 00:59:48,659
- It's not him.
- The conclusion...

899
00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:53,059
I brought evidence from
the Nojin-dong women's murder.

900
00:59:53,329 --> 00:59:54,599
Stop right there.

901
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:59,070
Did you leave out any items again?

902
00:59:59,969 --> 01:00:01,440
Did you or not?

903
01:00:01,670 --> 01:00:02,699
No.

904
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:08,010
Wait there until I'm done checking.

905
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:17,949
Hey, what's this mark on the wrists?

906
01:00:18,019 --> 01:00:19,719
Was there any rope or string?

907
01:00:20,119 --> 01:00:21,320
No.

908
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:24,460
- There wasn't?
- No.

909
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:27,599
Wait, I... Darn him.

910
01:00:56,159 --> 01:00:57,260
Nothing.

911
01:01:10,969 --> 01:01:14,309
Was she in the army or something?
Why is everything so organized?

912
01:01:25,150 --> 01:01:27,219
She hung up clothes
that weren't even washed?

913
01:01:51,349 --> 01:01:52,650
If we don't catch him quick,

914
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:56,719
there will be another murder.

915
01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:00,960
He was right.

916
01:02:13,969 --> 01:02:16,869
When we had found Hong Na Ri's body,
her front tooth was chipped,

917
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:18,340
and her forehead was bleeding.

918
01:02:18,710 --> 01:02:21,079
Judging by how this mirror is bloody,

919
01:02:21,110 --> 01:02:23,179
The killer must've smashed
her face against it.

920
01:02:23,210 --> 01:02:24,880
That's why her forehead split open
and her front tooth got chipped.

921
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:26,809
The door lock was intact.

922
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,980
She didn't try to escape.

923
01:02:29,019 --> 01:02:30,590
I'm sure they knew each other.

924
01:02:32,019 --> 01:02:33,119
Darn it.

925
01:02:37,090 --> 01:02:38,329
Is there water in here?

926
01:02:40,659 --> 01:02:41,730
What?

927
01:02:43,869 --> 01:02:44,900
(Milk)

928
01:02:49,099 --> 01:02:50,510
But get this.

929
01:02:51,039 --> 01:02:52,969
The MO is different from
Kang Min Joo's case.

930
01:02:53,110 --> 01:02:56,840
The latter was kidnapped, killed,
and disposed in different places.

931
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,409
But the former was found inside her home.

932
01:02:58,480 --> 01:02:59,909
The killer didn't even move her body.

933
01:02:59,949 --> 01:03:01,679
And he didn't even leave behind
the murder weapon.

934
01:03:01,719 --> 01:03:02,980
This case is different.

935
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:05,789
Unlike Kang Min Joo who was facing down,
she was lying on her side.

936
01:03:07,050 --> 01:03:08,360
Right.

937
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:11,929
You're right.

938
01:03:12,329 --> 01:03:13,760
Could this be a different killer?

939
01:03:13,789 --> 01:03:15,159
No, it's the same one.

940
01:03:15,329 --> 01:03:16,400
How are you so sure?

941
01:03:17,929 --> 01:03:19,070
The mirror.

942
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:23,699
The killer intentionally slammed her face
into this mirror.

943
01:03:23,739 --> 01:03:24,809
"Intentionally"?

944
01:03:25,269 --> 01:03:28,409
He wanted to observe her
writing in pain as she died.

945
01:03:33,650 --> 01:03:37,489
He wanted to observe her
writing in pain as she died?

946
01:03:37,519 --> 01:03:40,789
In order to watch her in pain
more closely...

947
01:03:41,289 --> 01:03:42,389
Here.

948
01:03:43,489 --> 01:03:44,929
This is where he killed her.

949
01:03:46,389 --> 01:03:48,960
Then her husband came and gave her CPR?

950
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,170
"CPR"?

951
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:53,800
Yes, she had been given CPR,

952
01:03:53,829 --> 01:03:55,039
and her husband has been arrested
as a potential suspect.

953
01:03:55,070 --> 01:03:56,699
They weren't on good terms
and were living separately.

954
01:03:56,739 --> 01:03:58,239
That's more than enough motive for murder.

955
01:03:58,340 --> 01:04:00,239
No, the killer must've given CPR to her.

956
01:04:00,539 --> 01:04:03,539
What? According to you,

957
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:06,849
this psychopath enjoyed
killing their victims.

958
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:08,219
So why did he try to revive her?

959
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:09,380
Why did he suddenly change his mind?

960
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:10,519
That's not it.

961
01:04:10,989 --> 01:04:13,090
He wanted to revive her
and kill her again.

962
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:17,389
He wanted to enjoy watching her in pain
for as long as possible.

963
01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:21,159
The method has become more aggravated.

964
01:04:21,199 --> 01:04:22,730
It's more gruesome.

965
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:24,369
It seems like he was experimenting...

966
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:26,000
to find out how to enjoy killing
for longer periods of time.

967
01:04:26,869 --> 01:04:28,400
If we don't catch them soon,

968
01:04:28,699 --> 01:04:30,769
countless more innocent lives
will be lost.

969
01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:33,309
How are you so sure?

970
01:04:33,469 --> 01:04:34,510
Just because.

971
01:04:34,739 --> 01:04:37,809
I put myself in the killer's shoes,

972
01:04:38,909 --> 01:04:41,449
and this is what comes to mind.

973
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,489
He didn't want the police
to find the rope...

974
01:04:45,519 --> 01:04:47,190
and link it to the previous murder.

975
01:04:47,690 --> 01:04:50,829
So he used this clothesline to kill her.

976
01:04:50,929 --> 01:04:53,659
After she died, he must've hung it back.

977
01:04:53,690 --> 01:04:57,429
Then he must've hung the clothes...

978
01:04:57,570 --> 01:05:00,170
extremely neatly.

979
01:05:00,199 --> 01:05:03,300
You're right. How did you know that?

980
01:05:03,340 --> 01:05:05,010
I just had that feeling.

981
01:05:05,110 --> 01:05:07,340
And I'm certain...

982
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:10,010
that the killer is a perfectionist.

983
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:11,380
Officer Jung.

984
01:05:12,949 --> 01:05:14,480
Help me catch the killer.

985
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:17,250
What? You're going to catch them?

986
01:05:18,389 --> 01:05:19,750
The Serious Crime Team should do it.

987
01:05:19,789 --> 01:05:22,190
No. Things have changed now.

988
01:05:22,489 --> 01:05:25,530
If what you said is true,
the killer has taken two lives already.

989
01:05:25,559 --> 01:05:27,300
But last time, you said...

990
01:05:27,460 --> 01:05:29,699
the killer could've committed
more murders in the past.

991
01:05:29,730 --> 01:05:31,670
That means there could be more victims.

992
01:05:31,699 --> 01:05:35,670
In that case, this scumbag
is a psychopath and a serial killer.

993
01:05:36,369 --> 01:05:37,510
Correct.

994
01:05:38,710 --> 01:05:42,480
You see, I need to catch a killer
who deserves to die.

995
01:05:42,510 --> 01:05:44,110
Last time, I failed.

996
01:05:44,579 --> 01:05:45,949
But this time, I'll succeed at all costs.

997
01:05:46,210 --> 01:05:47,579
You will help me, won't you?

998
01:05:51,349 --> 01:05:53,119
Thank you for the offer.

999
01:05:54,119 --> 01:05:55,690
But I have work to do
back at my substation.

1000
01:05:55,719 --> 01:05:57,659
- It's Pyeongan Substation.
- No.

1001
01:05:57,690 --> 01:05:59,630
You don't need to work there.

1002
01:05:59,789 --> 01:06:02,030
- What?
- Detective Shin told me.

1003
01:06:02,329 --> 01:06:04,929
You don't need to do anything there. Okay?

1004
01:06:05,469 --> 01:06:06,929
What do you mean?

1005
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,170
You don't even need to show up for work.

1006
01:06:08,940 --> 01:06:10,570
I don't need to show up for work?

1007
01:06:21,079 --> 01:06:23,150
What did I eat?

1008
01:06:27,219 --> 01:06:28,960
Gosh, my anus is going to be inflamed.

1009
01:06:39,030 --> 01:06:40,099
I'm pretty certain...

1010
01:06:41,769 --> 01:06:43,769
that the victims knew the killer.

1011
01:06:46,269 --> 01:06:49,039
But why do none of their acquaintances
overlap?

1012
01:06:51,579 --> 01:06:52,780
Mu Chi.

1013
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:55,349
What are you failing to see?

1014
01:06:56,420 --> 01:06:57,519
He enjoyed it.

1015
01:06:58,219 --> 01:07:00,519
He tied it loosely on purpose.

1016
01:07:12,369 --> 01:07:15,570
This... I saw this.

1017
01:07:20,570 --> 01:07:21,809
Let's see.

1018
01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:25,179

1021

Inspector Park's wife talked
about finding their kid.

1022
01:07:53,670 --> 01:07:57,449
- You see...
- That scum is a mutant and a monster...

1023
01:07:57,510 --> 01:07:58,949
who should never have been born.

1024
01:07:59,010 --> 01:08:01,219
What he said that day
was the source of trouble.

1025
01:08:02,179 --> 01:08:04,449
The killer broke into his house...

1026
01:08:04,719 --> 01:08:07,320
and took their kids.

1027
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:12,460
Early next morning,
Hyeon Seok got hit by a car...

1028
01:08:12,489 --> 01:08:14,199
on the road about 30km away from home.

1029
01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:17,529
He was running away from the killer
and jumped into the road.

1030
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,500
Do a thorough search.

1031
01:08:19,729 --> 01:08:21,800
The military and the police searched
for Hyeon Soo far and wide,

1032
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:23,300
but they still failed to find her.

1033
01:08:24,270 --> 01:08:25,770
About five years later,

1034
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:28,279
they were constructing a tunnel
in Mount Guryong.

1035
01:08:28,409 --> 01:08:29,579
- What is it?
- Over there!

1036
01:08:29,779 --> 01:08:31,779
The clothes and shoes found there...

1037
01:08:32,079 --> 01:08:35,279
matched with Hyeon Soo's
when she was kidnapped.

1038
01:08:36,119 --> 01:08:39,949
They carried out a DNA test
with the hair from the scene.

1039
01:08:39,989 --> 01:08:41,119
It was a match.

1040
01:08:41,590 --> 01:08:44,630
But they couldn't accept her death.

1041
01:08:45,130 --> 01:08:47,329
That's why his wife is still digging...

1042
01:08:48,060 --> 01:08:49,630
to find her body.

The MO is different
to that of Kang Min Joo's case.

1045
01:08:57,569 --> 01:09:00,909
The latter was kidnapped, killed,
and disposed in different places.

1046
01:09:00,939 --> 01:09:02,810
But the former was found inside her home.

Hello, Detective Shin.

1049
01:09:24,930 --> 01:09:27,840
It's about that part-timer
who used to work at a pub.

1050
01:09:28,239 --> 01:09:31,810
Could I see the knot that was tied
around Ms. Kang Min Joo's wrists?

1051
01:09:33,140 --> 01:09:34,409
The Evidence Storage Team?

1052
01:09:35,539 --> 01:09:38,779
You're right.
This is the highwayman's hitch.

1053
01:09:40,180 --> 01:09:42,579
I think it was tied
by the same individual.

1054
01:09:43,479 --> 01:09:46,949
But unlike this knot,
this one looks lousier...

1055
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:49,619
as if a young kid had tied it.

1056
01:09:57,460 --> 01:09:58,569
Is anyone here?

How did Han Seo Joon learn
to tie that knot?

1063
01:11:11,170 --> 01:11:14,310
Doctors generally know
how to tie surgical knots,

1064
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:16,010
but this type is for hiking.

1065
01:11:16,210 --> 01:11:18,350
He must've learned it from someone.

1066
01:11:18,479 --> 01:11:20,949
The person who taught him.

1067
01:11:20,979 --> 01:11:24,489
Or... Or he could've taught someone else.

1068
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:26,020
The person who learned from him.

1069
01:11:27,489 --> 01:11:30,560
Then this individual would be
the potential suspect.

1070
01:11:31,029 --> 01:11:32,390
We should meet him first.

1071
01:11:37,359 --> 01:11:38,069
What?

1072
01:11:38,430 --> 01:11:39,430
What is it?

1073
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:41,100
I think someone was here.

1074
01:11:41,539 --> 01:11:42,640
What?

1075
01:11:42,699 --> 01:11:45,170
This. It's not in the same spot
as when I came in.

1076
01:11:45,239 --> 01:11:46,939
- It's in the same spot.
- It's not.

Are you a genius? Smart enough
to remember a box was moved?

Come along. We must hurry
or visitation will be over.

1079
01:11:52,279 --> 01:11:54,180
- Hurry up.
- It was moved.

Han Seo Joon refused to see you.

1082
01:12:02,119 --> 01:12:03,159
What?

1083
01:12:04,159 --> 01:12:07,460
He doesn't want to see
the man who killed his son.

1084

But...

1085
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:39,289
You said you'd see me.

1086

It's you.

1087

I heard Yo Han almost killed you.

1088
01:12:53,010 --> 01:12:54,640
I wanted to apologize...

1089
01:12:55,739 --> 01:12:57,310
in my son's stead.

1090
01:13:01,050 --> 01:13:03,920
We met before, haven't we?

1091
01:13:04,689 --> 01:13:05,819
Me?

1092
01:13:10,390 --> 01:13:11,689
I'm disappointed that...

1093
01:13:12,260 --> 01:13:13,829
you don't remember me.

1094
01:13:15,159 --> 01:13:17,729
It seems your surgery
wasn't a complete success.

1095
01:13:18,930 --> 01:13:20,069
That's a pity.

1096
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:22,699
But...

1097
01:13:23,970 --> 01:13:25,710
compared to before the surgery,

1098
01:13:27,140 --> 01:13:29,079
the look in your eyes has changed.

1099
01:13:30,609 --> 01:13:31,880
Me?

1100
01:13:33,779 --> 01:13:36,279
You must not lose in the battle of wills.

1101
01:13:43,119 --> 01:13:44,390
Do you remember this?

1102
01:13:45,430 --> 01:13:49,359
It's the knot you tied around Hyeon Soo,
Detective Park's daughter's wrists.

1103
01:13:50,229 --> 01:13:52,670
It's similar to a knot used in
mountain search and rescue.

1104
01:13:53,130 --> 01:13:54,369
Who did you learn it from?

1105
01:13:54,670 --> 01:13:56,140
I never learned it.

1106
01:13:57,199 --> 01:13:58,270
Is that so?

1107
01:13:59,010 --> 01:14:01,210
Then you came up with the knot.

1108
01:14:02,140 --> 01:14:03,909
Did you teach it to someone?

1109
01:14:04,439 --> 01:14:05,949
I never taught it.

1110
01:14:09,180 --> 01:14:11,220
Then who saw you tie it?

1111
01:14:13,350 --> 01:14:14,590
No one.

1112
01:14:16,119 --> 01:14:17,760
Try to look back.

1113
01:14:18,590 --> 01:14:20,229
This is an important issue.

1114
01:14:20,729 --> 01:14:23,329
I never tied it, learned it,

1115
01:14:23,399 --> 01:14:27,229
or taught it to anyone.

1116
01:14:29,569 --> 01:14:30,939
Don't lie.

1117
01:14:33,569 --> 01:14:35,310
If you never taught it to anyone,

1118
01:14:35,479 --> 01:14:38,210
how could the same knot you used
to tie a child 25 years ago...

1119
01:14:38,310 --> 01:14:39,909
show up again?

1120
01:14:42,779 --> 01:14:44,550
Why are you asking me that?

1121
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:57,430
I didn't expect anything
from the likes of you.

1122
01:14:58,329 --> 01:15:00,369
And I won't accept the fake apology...

1123
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,470
you offered instead of your son.

1124
01:15:03,539 --> 01:15:05,939
I said it's not a lie
and you don't believe me.

1125
01:15:06,539 --> 01:15:09,380
Do you not get what I'm saying?

1126
01:15:27,590 --> 01:15:28,800
It's not him.

1127
01:15:29,930 --> 01:15:32,329
The person
who killed the child 26 years ago.

1128
01:15:35,239 --> 01:15:36,300
By the way,

1129
01:15:37,539 --> 01:15:39,539
you need to meet my friend.

1130
01:15:40,470 --> 01:15:44,310
Say hello. This is my little cellmate.

1131
01:16:28,420 --> 01:16:31,020
What is this? What is this memory?

1132
01:17:05,829 --> 01:17:08,430
(Mouse)

1133
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:10,930
A witness? There was
no mention in the case file.

1134
01:17:11,369 --> 01:17:14,029
Han Seo Joon's the killer
but someone else tied the knot.

1135
01:17:14,229 --> 01:17:15,270
An accomplice?

1136
01:17:15,399 --> 01:17:17,300
Did the brain surgery make you a genius?

1137
01:17:17,369 --> 01:17:18,869
Do you know a producer
called Choi Hong Ju?

1138
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:20,640
Did I like her?

1139
01:17:20,909 --> 01:17:22,079
That girl.

1140
01:17:22,909 --> 01:17:25,350
Do you know where she is now?

1141
01:17:25,479 --> 01:17:28,079
I see you're well and healthy.
It's good to see you, Officer Jung.

1142
01:17:28,250 --> 01:17:30,579
Why do I feel a zap?

1143
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:32,220
- Officer Jung.
- Yes?

1144
01:17:32,619 --> 01:17:33,689
Do you want to join my team?

1145
01:17:34,649 --> 01:17:35,659
Me?
