Who are you?

17
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,209
Why did you kill them?

18
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:13,140
My family.

19
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,590
Now you remember.

20
00:01:21,019 --> 00:01:22,489
That's a bit unfair.

21
00:01:22,689 --> 00:01:24,790
I never forgot you for a second.

22
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,730
I've been looking for you since that day.

23
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:30,829
I even became a cop
in case it would help finding you.

24

26
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:39,540

I refuse to live with him any longer.

He...

39
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,379
He buried his own brother.

40
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,949
I knew it the moment he killed
the goldfish and Choco.

41

44
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,969
Look at those eyes.

45
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,699
- How dare you...
- Honey.

46
00:03:53,539 --> 00:03:54,710

47
00:03:58,009 --> 00:03:59,710

What about Jae Min and Jae Hee?

51
00:05:21,129 --> 00:05:23,230
Dad took them to the amusement park.

52
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:37,540
Please don't misunderstand.

53
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,750
I wasn't trying to kill him.

54
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:43,509
He kept tattling on me,

55
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,649
so I just wanted to punish him.

56
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,050
I just wanted to teach him a lesson.

57
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:52,759
It's the truth, Mom.

58
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:56,829
Okay.

59
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,199

61
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:49,310
You monster. Die.

62
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,879
Die!

63
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:58,589
Just die.

64
00:07:07,329 --> 00:07:08,730

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,029
I'm sorry for not believing you.

71
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,560
Mom.

72
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,470
I had...

73
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:17,470
no choice.

74

Why just me?

78
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,820
No.

79
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,350
There's one more.

80
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,419
There's another child...

81
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:46,029
who's just like you.

82
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:52,700
My poor kid.

83
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:58,740
Mom, wake up.

84
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,409
Mom.

85
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:13,960
My son.

86
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,600
You're a good child, right?

87
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,840

88
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,139

91

- That's so gruesome.
- Oh, dear.

92
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:53,059
Oh, my.

93
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:55,259
Poor kid.

94
00:10:55,289 --> 00:10:58,399
- Luckily, he wasn't home.
- You're absolutely right.

95
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,500
- Poor kid.
- I know.

("Entire Family Murdered in Guryeong")

97
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:07,169
He lost his entire family
but hasn't shed a tear.

98
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,440
But still,
how could they do that to a child?

99
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,539
Do you remember anything from that day?

100
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:14,480
No. Nothing.

101
00:11:14,909 --> 00:11:16,480
How dare you murder my family?

102
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,950
I'm going to chase you
to the ends of the earth...

103
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:21,549
and pay back for what you've done.

104
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,330
This is revenge murder.

105
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,399
I'm taking revenge.

106
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:41,309
I'd like to borrow this.

107
00:11:41,669 --> 00:11:43,409
Why? What's this about?

108
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,779
I need to look into something.

109
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:46,409
I'll tell you next time.

110
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:50,309
Did he continue to box back then?

111
00:11:50,549 --> 00:11:53,720
No. After his sister's death,

112
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,419
he quit soon after.

113
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:00,759
He had worked at a company back then.

114
00:12:02,259 --> 00:12:03,529
A company? What kind of company?

115
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,029
It was some kind of
a bodyguard services company.

116
00:12:06,929 --> 00:12:09,129
He was having such a hard time back then.

117
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,539
So he went to this place...

118
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,539
called the national
counseling support center.

119
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:17,070
I think that someone there helped him
get the job...

120
00:12:17,139 --> 00:12:18,809
while taking counseling sessions.

121
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:22,009
He worked there for about ten years.

122
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,919
He worked hard and diligently,

123
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,120
but one night,

124
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:30,690
I heard him wailing in his room
all night long.

125
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:34,429
Soo Ho. Soo Ho, what's the matter?

126
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:37,090
I don't know what happened,

127
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:40,059
but I hadn't seen him
crying out loud since his sister died.

128
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:44,399
The next day, I found a receipt
from Guryeong Toll Gate...

129
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:49,009
in his clothes while cleaning his room.

130
00:12:49,409 --> 00:12:51,340
He quit his job right after that...

131
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:54,679
and started helping his friend
with work at his boxing gym.

132
00:12:55,809 --> 00:12:57,110
Guryeong...

133
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:00,350
Didn't he tell you what happened?

134
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:03,389
I subtly asked him once
but he wouldn't tell me.

135
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,490
Oh, right.

136
00:13:05,789 --> 00:13:09,830
A few days later,
a detective came to see Soo Ho.

137
00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:14,299
The detective asked Soo Ho
a few questions and just left.

138
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:16,299
A detective?

139
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,110
This is Guryeong Lake, right?

140
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,480
I didn't get the answer in the end.

141
00:13:25,509 --> 00:13:27,279
To why he killed my family.

142
00:13:30,049 --> 00:13:31,250
Was it a robbery?

143
00:13:31,649 --> 00:13:33,720
No. If that's the case,
he would've killed me too.

144
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:38,389
Why did he set our house on fire
after getting me out of there?

145
00:13:39,889 --> 00:13:41,129
Why just me?

146
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:03,149
This man...

147
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:06,419
He looks familiar.

148
00:14:18,429 --> 00:14:20,159
You should've let me die.

149
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,070
Why did you save me?

150
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:23,730
Why?

151
00:14:28,809 --> 00:14:31,539
No wonder why he looked familiar.

152
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:36,480
You shouldn't have saved me then.

153
00:14:37,379 --> 00:14:39,580
Then he wouldn't have been born.

154
00:14:43,889 --> 00:14:46,559
- But, why did he only save me?
- Why did he only spare me?

155
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:01,539
Sung Yo Han went to an elementary school
in Guryeong.

156
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,710
Then is this kid Sung Yo Han?

157
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:12,250
Right. That explains the connection
between Sung Yo Han and Song Soo Ho.

158
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:25,200
Who might you be?

159
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,799
I'm with the police.
There's something I need to check.

160
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,269
What would a police officer have to do
at this house?

161
00:15:36,809 --> 00:15:39,179
You're him, right?
The national hero Officer Jung.

162
00:15:41,549 --> 00:15:43,610
I saw you on the news.

163
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:47,220
You went through a lot
because of that darn scum.

164
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:53,059
I suppose you came here
because of Sung Yo Han.

165
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:55,629
Sung Yo Han?

166
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,029
I thought he was Jae Hoon at first.

167
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,129
I was totally shocked when I saw the news
that night.

168
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,769
What do you mean by that?

169
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:06,440
That day, that scum Sung Yo Han...

170
00:16:06,769 --> 00:16:09,610
looked at this house for a long while
and left.

171
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,710
Are you saying that he came here?

172
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,179
- When was it?
- You know.

173
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,379
That very day when he got shot.

174
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,549
He came in the afternoon
and looked at the house for a long while.

175
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:25,490
So I took a quick glance at him,

176
00:16:26,059 --> 00:16:28,559
and he seemed to be around Jae Hoon's age.

177
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:29,759
So I asked him,

178
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:33,899
"Are you Jae Hoon?"

179
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,830
Then he said that he's not Jae Hoon
and I was mistaken.

180
00:16:37,169 --> 00:16:39,639
He got all flustered and left.

181
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,970
Really?

182
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:43,340
Yes.

183
00:16:43,409 --> 00:16:44,509
Oh, right.

184
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:48,980
He turned around and came back
to ask about the daughter of that family.

185
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:51,080
About Jae Hee?

186
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:54,250
The youngest daughter went missing.

187
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:57,220
Only three dead bodies were found
in the house.

188
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:00,960
Everyone whispered...

189
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:04,630
that the eldest son probably killed
the whole family.

190
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:09,170
They all thought that he killed his sister
and hid her body too.

191
00:17:09,769 --> 00:17:12,869
You see, there was something really off
about Jae Hoon.

192
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,210
I wonder where he lives
and what he does now.

193
00:17:16,539 --> 00:17:18,339
I wonder if he lives a decent life.

194
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,119
I hope that he grew up to be a good man
just like you,

195
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:27,819
the national hero Officer Jung.

196
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,119
Thank you.

197
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,460
Why did he come here?

198
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,299
And how did he know Jae Hee?

199
00:17:39,529 --> 00:17:41,430
She went missing in 2005.

200
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:43,529
Her current age is 22.

201
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:45,799
Her name was Jung Jae Hee
when she went missing.

202
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:48,470
And she had savant syndrome.

203
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:49,970
She remembered everything she heard.

204
00:17:50,339 --> 00:17:54,480
We don't have any records
of a child with such characteristics.

205
00:17:56,579 --> 00:17:59,119
I'll ask the disabled persons
protection agency.

206
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,450
Thank you.

207
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:03,119
Please find my little sister.
I'm imploring you.

208
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:05,519
This kid is Jae Hoon from Class Three.

209
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:08,329
- He's not Yo Han.
- Jae Hoon?

210
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:10,789
Yes, his name is Jung Jae Hoon.

211
00:18:11,089 --> 00:18:13,900
Haven't you heard
about the Guryeong family murder case?

212
00:18:14,099 --> 00:18:15,500
He's the eldest son of the family.

213
00:18:17,269 --> 00:18:19,269
The Guryeong family murder case?

214
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,809
I found a receipt from Guryeong Toll Gate.

215
00:18:21,869 --> 00:18:23,640
I heard him wailing in his room
all night long.

216
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,240
A few days later,

217
00:18:25,579 --> 00:18:27,710
a detective came to see Soo Ho.

218
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:30,349
Then what happened to this kid?

219
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:32,849
I think I heard that his relative
took him under her wing.

220
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:35,420
Ask the police. That'll be faster.

221
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:37,190
Thank you.

222
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:44,289
That house is still
under the parents' names.

223
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:48,799
I see why it's still standing there
looking creepy without having been sold.

224
00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:51,900
Then what about the twin who went missing?

225
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:53,640
- You mean the daughter?
- Yes.

226
00:18:54,869 --> 00:18:56,109
We couldn't find her.

227
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:57,940
Hello.

228
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:00,880
Hey, Jung Ba Reum.

229
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:04,009
- Detective Go.
- I've been calling you all day.

230
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,690
I'm looking into something.
What brings you here?

231
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,589
I'm Detective Go Mu Chi
from Mujin Metropolitan Police Agency.

232
00:19:12,289 --> 00:19:14,289
Does the detective who was in charge of
the Guryeong family murder case...

233
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,930
still work here?

234
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:17,829
I was in charge of that case.

235
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,329
That's great.

236
00:19:20,099 --> 00:19:23,369
The kid in these photos...
You remember him, don't you?

237
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,440
He's the eldest son.

238
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,569
It was taken on the day
when I drowned and killed Choco.

239
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,569
Was this man also a suspect?

240
00:19:29,609 --> 00:19:31,710
Yes, for a while.

241
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,509
I remember going all the way
to Mujin to find him.

242
00:19:33,579 --> 00:19:34,650
And what happened?

243
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:37,609
Give me a second. I need to see the file.

244
00:19:40,049 --> 00:19:41,180
He's not in the file.

245
00:19:41,289 --> 00:19:44,490
As soon as I became a police officer,
I looked into all the suspects.

246
00:19:45,019 --> 00:19:46,160
But I didn't see him.

247
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:48,859
He's not here.

248
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:51,400
That's weird. Why was his record omitted?

249
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:53,900
I clearly remember
that I wrote a report on him.

250
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:55,730
Was it omitted?

251
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:58,099
This is so strange.
Who would have made such a mistake?

252
00:19:59,069 --> 00:20:02,039
We have the investigation report
on the eldest son though.

253
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:03,670
You mean this kid?

254
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:05,710
Was he a suspect too?

255
00:20:05,779 --> 00:20:07,339
But you said he's their son.

256
00:20:08,509 --> 00:20:10,950
Actually, he didn't seem to be sad
at all...

257
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,549
after such a terrible thing happened
to his family.

258
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,190
I mean, the kid was so suspicious,

259
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:19,190
so we even did a polygraph unofficially.

260
00:20:19,589 --> 00:20:21,289
- So?
- He seemed innocent.

261
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:23,960
There's no way an 11-year-old boy
killed his family.

262
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:26,029
We did that because we had no clue
and were frustrated.

263
00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:28,000
Do you happen to know
where this kid is now?

264
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:31,099
His aunt took him under her wing.

265
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,900
His aunt? Can I get her phone number?

266
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,269
Here it is.

267
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,109
(Contact Details, Guardian, Aunt)

268
00:20:48,349 --> 00:20:49,549
That number doesn't exist.

269
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:52,220
Can you bring up her identity?

270
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,720
Okay. Hold on.

271
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,029
(No results found)

272
00:20:58,099 --> 00:20:59,200
Why did nothing come up?

273
00:21:00,829 --> 00:21:01,970
That's weird.

274
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:03,869
I checked her ID at the time.

275
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,700
Can you run this kid's identity?

276
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,039
Give me a moment.

277
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:12,910
I'll show up as Jung Jae Hoon right away.

278
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,680
What should I do?

279
00:21:16,579 --> 00:21:18,650
His social security number was expunged.

280
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,680
- Expunged?
- Expunged?

281
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:24,220
That means he's dead or went abroad.

282
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,819
That's not my social security number.

283
00:21:26,259 --> 00:21:28,160
Aunt said she'd put me
on her family certificate.

284
00:21:29,029 --> 00:21:31,190
But instead of adopting me,
she had my identity expunged?

285
00:21:32,259 --> 00:21:34,529
Then how did I get
my current social security number?

286
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,440
What were you doing here anyway?

287
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,569
I was looking into Chi Gook's killer.

288
00:21:45,339 --> 00:21:48,750
I checked the case files to see
if Sung Yo Han had an accomplice.

289
00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:52,019
It turned out he used to live in Guryeong.

290
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,750
So I came over just in case.

291
00:21:57,089 --> 00:22:00,519
Where did you get that kid's photo?

292
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:03,289
From Song Soo Ho's photo album.

293
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,299
He had an OZ tattoo as well.

294
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,329
So I went to his place to check.

295
00:22:09,269 --> 00:22:12,640
I think he had something to do
with the death of this kid's family.

296
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:13,769
Song Soo Ho was in it too?

297
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:15,210
Song Soo Ho's mom said...

298
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,869
he cried all night
after returning from Guryeong.

299
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:20,240
That was around the time
that kid's family was massacred.

300
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:23,680
Anyway, the OZ group
that Song Soo Ho was a part of.

301
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:27,220
They're working with the psycho who killed
Deok Soo, Jae Shik, and Byeong Tae.

302
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:30,549
He's been quiet for a few days,
but he'll move again soon.

303
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:33,819
Psychopaths like that
can't stand not killing.

304
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:40,299
Let's get back before it gets too late.

305
00:22:50,009 --> 00:22:55,049
You have a special type of gene.

306
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:57,410
There's another child...

307
00:22:58,619 --> 00:23:00,920
who's just like you.

308
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:04,549
How on earth did Mom know that?

309
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:07,960
Special gene?

310
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:10,789
Did you know all this from the get-go?

311
00:23:10,829 --> 00:23:12,259
Did you know that I'm a predator too?

312
00:23:12,329 --> 00:23:14,730
I wouldn't have asked you
to work with me if I had known it was you.

313
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,529
- I was sure that it was Sung Yo Han.
- What made you so sure of it?

314
00:23:17,569 --> 00:23:20,940
I ran the DNA test for the fetus
that Han Seo Joon's wife was carrying.

315
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:45,599
Since when was I being followed?

316
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,309
Okay, then.

317
00:24:01,009 --> 00:24:04,609
If Song Soo Ho killed this kid's family,
this kid could want revenge.

318
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,150
But this kid isn't Sung Yo Han.

319
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:08,490
Sung Yo Han killed Song Soo Ho
out of revenge.

320
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:12,259
What happened?

321
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:15,190
Sung Yo Han tried to kill Na Chi Gook.

322
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:17,160
Na Chi Gook woke up
and was being threatened.

323
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,900
Na Chi Gook was killed by OZ.

324
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:23,930
This is insane.

325
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:26,470
Oh, right.

326
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:30,069
- Is this Sung Yo Han's evidence?
- Yes.

327
00:24:30,109 --> 00:24:31,210
Why are you going through it?

328
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:35,849
I can't just watch Mu Chi get anxious
that Sung Yo Han might not be the killer.

329
00:24:36,049 --> 00:24:38,450
I'll go through every piece of evidence...

330
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:41,279
and prove to him
that Sung Yo Han's the killer.

331
00:24:46,259 --> 00:24:47,319
Hey.

332
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:51,329
What about the prints
on Kang Deok Soo's mom's statement?

333
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:54,500
I checked and they did find
prints from a third person.

334
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:57,069
But it's not clear enough
to be identified.

335
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,539
Where's Detective Lee?

336
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,480
Am I doing the right thing?

337
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:16,789
Jennifer.

338
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:27,200
Hey, what's up? You didn't call ahead.

339
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,039
Did you dupe me?

340
00:25:33,069 --> 00:25:35,109
It's so annoying.

341
00:25:35,539 --> 00:25:37,970
- What is?
- The Security Team...

342
00:25:38,009 --> 00:25:41,809
keeps suspecting we damaged
the surveillance footage we checked.

343
00:25:41,849 --> 00:25:43,349
What do you mean it's damaged?

344
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:46,549
Mu Chi thought a chunk of it is missing,

345
00:25:46,579 --> 00:25:48,019
so he took it to check.

346
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:50,349
What are you talking about?

347
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:54,160
That I have a special gene.
That there's another kid like me.

348
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,130
How did my mom know that?

349
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,960
That was you?

350
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:00,829
You're Min Gyu's son?

351
00:26:01,029 --> 00:26:04,029
Park Min Gyu and Kim Hee Jung's son?

352
00:26:04,099 --> 00:26:06,470
Yes. My mom was Kim Hee Jung...

353
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,869
and my birth father was Park Min Gyu.

354
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:11,910
I was so sure that...

355
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:15,180
your mother had you aborted.

356
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,380
Aborted?

357
00:26:25,859 --> 00:26:26,960
Are you looking for this?

358
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,069
Where's Detective Lee?

359
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:36,529
Outside smoking, I guess.

360
00:26:39,369 --> 00:26:40,500
- Hey, kid.
- Yes?

361
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:45,109
When he returns, make a passing comment
that I restored the missing footage...

362
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,740
from the lobby surveillance video.

363
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:49,609
- What?
- His reaction.

364
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:52,049
I need to see it for myself.

365
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,779
Is this what you're looking for?

366
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:56,789
Are you afraid I got the clip
with your face on it?

367
00:26:57,319 --> 00:26:59,119
What are you talking about?

368
00:26:59,259 --> 00:27:01,259
Then why were you going through my things?

369
00:27:01,289 --> 00:27:02,529
Come with me.

370
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:06,259
What on earth are you doing?

371
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,869
Let's see your hands.

372
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:12,569
Shoot.

373
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:17,069
Here it is.

374
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:21,410
You were rushed, weren't you?

375
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,809
Were you getting anxious?

376
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:25,150
What are you lot? A group of psychopaths?

377
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,319
What are you?

378
00:27:26,349 --> 00:27:27,920
What on earth are you talking about?

379
00:27:28,019 --> 00:27:30,990
I'd tattooed my girlfriend's initials,
but we broke up, so I had it removed.

380
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:34,960
Fine. Then what about
the missing surveillance footage?

381
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:37,630
You showed
Kang Deok Soo's statement to OZ.

382
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:40,559
What are you saying I showed and to whom?

383
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:43,829
I got the footage restored.
I'll show it to you. Come with me.

384
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,400
Are you talking about that?

385
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:48,769
I dropped the statement in the lobby.

386
00:27:48,809 --> 00:27:50,569
Someone picked it up for me.

387
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:53,440
And I didn't cut out anything
from any video.

388
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,880
I know.

389
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,720
We policemen aren't paid nearly enough.

390
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,289
It's hard to get by.

391
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:07,490
Did those jerks pay you a lot?

392
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:11,230
What are you on about?

393
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:13,200
You're a two-timer.

394
00:28:21,769 --> 00:28:22,869
Money?

395
00:28:24,809 --> 00:28:26,640
I do it for a sense of duty.

396
00:28:34,619 --> 00:28:36,289
That idiot, stop.

397
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:47,829
Hey. What brand is this shirt?

398
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:49,529
- It looks nice.
- Hands off.

399
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:52,369
- Go away.
- Let me see the tag.

400
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,910
That's hot.

401
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,009
I'm so sorry.

402
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:58,910
- Take it off.
- Oh, dear.

403
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,380
- I'm sorry.
- Are you all right?

404
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:02,349
Detective Shin,
you should've been careful.

405
00:29:02,609 --> 00:29:04,380
I hope you're not burned.

406
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:06,750
The back of your neck is all red.

407
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,019
- I said I'm fine.
- Okay, then.

408
00:29:10,049 --> 00:29:12,019
It must be waterproof.

409
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:14,160
It smells of coffee, though.

410
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:15,730
Will you sell it to me for cheap?

411
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,900
- No, thanks.
- I said I'm sorry.

412
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,700
Did you get it?

413
00:29:22,069 --> 00:29:23,799
- Mu Chi.
- Hey.

414
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:25,140
It is a burner phone.

415
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,170
It pinged off the cell tower for
the Ministry of Science and ICT.

416
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,369
- Science and ICT?
- Yes.

417
00:29:28,609 --> 00:29:30,240
Shouldn't we have him looked up?

418
00:29:30,539 --> 00:29:32,640
For what? Getting rid of a tattoo?

419
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,210
Or for using a burner phone?

420
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,710
He deleted part of
our surveillance footage.

421
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:37,809
Nothing proves that he did it.

422
00:29:37,849 --> 00:29:39,319
The video alone...

423
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:42,250
isn't enough to prove
he's working with the OZ gang.

424
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:46,019
We might suffer a blow-back
if we go after him without enough proof.

425
00:29:46,059 --> 00:29:48,630
Why did you rile him up, then?
You just made things worse.

426
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:51,160
At least, now I'm convinced.

427
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:52,259
Let's watch him.

428
00:29:52,299 --> 00:29:55,029
- See who he meets and talks to.
- Okay.

429
00:29:55,529 --> 00:29:57,599
Are you still looking for
the unregistered 6264 car?

430
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:59,500
I am,

431
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:03,509
but unregistered vehicles are hard to find
unless they get into an accident.

432
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:06,680
Where's Officer Jung?
I haven't seen him all day.

433
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:09,980
Let's work on this
without him for a while.

434
00:30:10,009 --> 00:30:11,109
Why?

435
00:30:11,809 --> 00:30:13,880
Something doesn't feel right.

436
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:21,519
Your father was a researcher on my team.

437
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:24,289
In order to improve our studies,
he convinced your mother...

438
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,930
and let us test the fetus' DNA and...

439
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:30,930
The result showed
it had the psychopath gene.

440
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,509
I had no choice
but to tell them the truth.

441
00:30:36,539 --> 00:30:39,609
I suggested they have an abortion
and they agreed, so I assumed...

442
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,950
I had no idea they kept the baby.

443
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,890
You said a psychopath
cares only about themselves.

444
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,990
I attacked Song Soo Ho for revenge.

445
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:55,759
That means I had affection for my family.

446
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:59,099
It wasn't affection towards your family.

447
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:00,630
"How dare you touch what's mine?"

448
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,430
"How dare you invade my territory?"

449
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,200
That's why you punished him.

450
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,940
(Song Soo Ho)

451
00:31:16,579 --> 00:31:18,680
I killed an innocent man because of you!

452
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:23,089
I ran it in our ex-convict database,
and he popped up right away.

453
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,319
(Shoulder, finger, pubis)

454
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,529
- I'm your aunt.
- My mom never had a sibling.

455
00:31:30,589 --> 00:31:32,730
His social security number was expunged.

456
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,400
(Song Soo Ho, Uncle, Aunt)

457
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:51,079
A guy had witnessed the murder
and ran away.

458
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:04,359
I was determined to find and kill him.

459
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:05,700
Officer Jung!

460
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:09,299
- Detective Go.
- But I ran into Detective Go...

461
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,569
and failed to find the guy.

462
00:32:13,269 --> 00:32:16,839
However, his jacket reminded me
of that guy's jacket.

463
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,990
(Shinnara Dry Cleaning, Nam-gu, Mujin)

464
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:34,890
(Shinnara Dry Cleaning)

465
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:32,009
That's right.
I had taken Kim Joon Sung's laptop.

466
00:33:46,059 --> 00:33:48,359
I took photos of my victims
while they were still alive,

467
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,529
but these were taken after their death.

468
00:33:59,109 --> 00:34:01,380
It's the same photo I saw
at Sung Yo Han's house.

469
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:07,849
So he watched me kill them
and took the photos afterward?

470
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:09,449
And didn't call the police?

471
00:34:12,059 --> 00:34:13,260
He's definitely one of them.

472
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,530
(Uncle, Aunt, Sung Yo Han)

473
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:24,969
No.

474
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,800
He tried to kill me.

475
00:34:28,539 --> 00:34:31,969
Why wasn't he like the others
and tried to kill me?

476
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:37,780
Song Soo Ho killed my mom to save me.

477
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:40,679
So why did Sung Yo Han want me dead?

478
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,150
Spare the boy first.

479
00:34:42,489 --> 00:34:44,250
Han Guk who's below your feet.

480
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:46,659
He wanted to save Han Guk.

481
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:48,659
If he was also an OZ,

482
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,760
he should've gotten rid
of that boy's body...

483
00:34:50,789 --> 00:34:52,460
and covered up the murder.

484
00:35:03,469 --> 00:35:04,570
You and I...

485
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:08,079
You and I...

486
00:35:09,849 --> 00:35:11,079
What was he trying to say?

487
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,349
What did he say?

488
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:18,650
You and I...

489
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:21,820
You and I...

490
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:31,969
I need to find out.

491
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:40,679
(Song Soo Ho, Uncle, Aunt, Sung Yo Han)

492
00:35:40,809 --> 00:35:43,349
Who was the person
from this building he had called?

493
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:48,449
Could it have anything to do
with Kim Joon Sung, Yo Han's friend,

494
00:35:48,519 --> 00:35:51,090
having worked
at the Ministry of Science and ICT?

495
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,920
Does that mean Kim Joon Sung
was also part of OZ?

496
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:55,389
Nothing.

497
00:35:56,389 --> 00:35:57,389
Are you sure?

498
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:01,530
Officer Jung, thoroughly examining bodies
is my job.

499
00:36:01,929 --> 00:36:03,130
I would've remembered.

500
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:04,969
I found nothing.

501
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:08,369
Did you perform an autopsy
for Sung Yo Han as well?

502
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:10,809
No. His mother didn't want it.

503
00:36:16,309 --> 00:36:17,880
Was Kim Joon Sung not one of them?

504
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,389
Then what about Sung Yo Han?

505
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:36,969
- Officer Jung did?
- Yes.

506
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,500
He asked the same question you asked.

507
00:36:38,969 --> 00:36:42,099
About any lettering tattoos
on Kim Joon Sung's body.

508
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:47,039
What in the world is he investigating?

509
00:36:47,809 --> 00:36:49,309
I had no time to check
something like that.

510
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:52,210
I was busy treating
the gunshot wound in his stomach.

511
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,250
Could there have been anyone
who was close enough with him...

512
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,519
to know if he had any tattoos on his body?

513
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:57,789
He had no such friends.

514
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:00,690
He was cold
and unfriendly toward everyone.

515
00:37:05,829 --> 00:37:07,099
How can I find this out?

516
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,070
There is no recording of the surgery.

517
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:16,309
None?

518
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,769
I had received
the world's very first brain implant.

519
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,809
You must've recorded it as a record.

520
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:23,809
Han Seo Joon wanted it to be a secret.

521
00:37:23,949 --> 00:37:24,909
Not only did he forbid the recording,

522
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:27,519
but also forbade anyone but him
to enter the OR.

523
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,619
He didn't want anyone to learn
how to do it.

524
00:37:30,389 --> 00:37:33,559
I don't understand why. He's on death row.

525
00:37:33,989 --> 00:37:36,690
Such medical techniques
should be shared with others.

526
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:38,429
It's a shame.

527
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:42,329
Even if there was a recording,

528
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:43,730
it was a brain transplant.

529
00:37:44,099 --> 00:37:46,070
Yo Han's body
wouldn't have been recorded.

530
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,010
I understand.

531
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,469
Wait.

532
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:53,940
Have your headaches subsided?

533
00:37:54,579 --> 00:37:57,550
I'll prescribe some medication,
so stop by the pharmacy.

534
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:48,059
He's a lunatic.

535
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,630
I can't believe he succeeded.

536
00:38:50,869 --> 00:38:52,070
What a shame.

537
00:38:52,469 --> 00:38:55,670
Had he not been a murderer,
he would've been a world-renowned...

538
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:57,639
Perhaps,

539
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:00,480
he only succeeded since he was a murderer.

540
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,179
How ironic is that?

541
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,599
Don't bother killing yourself.

542
00:39:23,929 --> 00:39:26,940
You don't have much time anyway.
You'll also die eventually.

543
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,389
Ba Reum.

544
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:50,230
I'm tired.

545
00:39:51,559 --> 00:39:52,829
Why are you doing this?

546
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:57,199
You're really dense, aren't you?
Take a guess.

547
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,369
I don't like you anymore.
You make me feel uncomfortable.

548
00:40:02,909 --> 00:40:03,969
Go home.

549
00:40:04,539 --> 00:40:06,010
I know it's because of Kang Deok Soo.

550
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:08,539
I know everything.

551
00:40:13,019 --> 00:40:14,719
I know you killed him.

552
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:16,650
That's why you're avoiding me.

553
00:40:17,989 --> 00:40:19,159
How...

554
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:26,500
Ba Reum. I don't care.

555
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:30,900
He deserved to die.

556
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:34,670
If you didn't kill him,
Yu Na would've died instead.

557
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,409
- So...
- You're right.

558
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,840
I killed him.

559
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:44,179
It was because of you.

560
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:46,420
I killed him to keep you safe.

561
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:49,449
But look at what you've caused.

562
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:52,889
I should've just let him be.
You turned me into a murderer!

563
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:57,389
- Ba Reum.
- You remind me of that night.

564
00:40:57,929 --> 00:40:59,500
It's a horrific memory!

565
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,969
So please stay out of my sight.

566
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:05,869
Ba Reum.

567
00:41:07,369 --> 00:41:10,340
Listen. If you ever show up
in front of me again,

568
00:41:11,309 --> 00:41:14,079
I'll turn myself in for killing
Kang Deok Soo and go to prison.

569
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:17,179
If you don't want to see me
rot in prison for the rest of my life,

570
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:21,380
never show your face to me again.
Do I make myself clear?

571
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:42,269
I remembered everything.

572
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:46,679
Help me.

573
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:50,250
Please help me.

574
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:51,750
That day...

575
00:41:59,389 --> 00:42:00,460
Bong Yi.

576
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,559
Please...

577
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,260
Please help me.

578
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:07,599
That day, I...

579
00:42:09,269 --> 00:42:10,829
Please help me.

580
00:42:17,139 --> 00:42:19,139
What should I do, Bong Yi?

581
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:22,710
What do I do?

582
00:42:27,349 --> 00:42:30,449
If this kid is the killer,
not Sung Yo Han,

583
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:33,860
he threatened and killed Na Chi Gook
because he knew it.

584
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:38,059
Then why did Sung Yo Han try to kill
Officer Jung?

585
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:40,059
What about the victims' photos
at Sung Yo Han's house?

586
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:41,059
It doesn't make sense.

587
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:51,170
(There's a possibility that Song Soo Ho
was killed by the kid, not Sung Yo Han.)

588
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:53,179
(Kang Deok Soo, Lee Jae Shik,
Kim Byeong Tae)

589
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:54,940
(Kang Deok Soo's mother's statement?
A police insider)

590
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:56,980
(The black mid-size sedan, OZ!)

591
00:42:57,650 --> 00:43:00,050
(The unmanned motel located on the edge
of the motel village, easy to flee from)

592
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:01,179
Wait.

593
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:05,090
Maybe Ms. Choi found out something.

594
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:09,460
Why would she suddenly make a documentary
about the Mujin serial murders...

595
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:11,260
when the killer was already found?

596
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,500
What?

597
00:43:20,539 --> 00:43:22,940
Why are you preparing a show
about the Mujin serial murders again?

598
00:43:23,039 --> 00:43:24,309
You found out something, didn't you?

599
00:43:24,369 --> 00:43:25,610
No, I found out nothing.

600
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:28,639
I heard that the killer of Kang Deok Soo,
Lee Jae Shik, and Kim Byeong Tae...

601
00:43:28,679 --> 00:43:31,880
left a similar signature to the ones
found at Song Soo Ho's murder scene.

602
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:33,880
So I wanted to review the case
all over again.

603
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:35,679
She found something.

604
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:37,289
I'm sure of it.

605
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:38,849
All right then.

606
00:43:45,059 --> 00:43:47,030
Look, brother. I made this by myself.

607
00:43:47,059 --> 00:43:48,960
Make sure to hang it in your car, okay?

608
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:52,170
I wanted to make sure there would be
no other victim like you...

609
00:43:52,199 --> 00:43:53,699
who faced wrongful deaths.

610
00:43:55,269 --> 00:43:57,170
But I ended up...

611
00:44:16,059 --> 00:44:18,590
(Detective Go Mu Chi)

612
00:44:22,769 --> 00:44:25,769
Hello?

613
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:30,309
What was that? Who would call this late?

614
00:45:06,909 --> 00:45:07,940
Hello?

615
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:12,409
Keep it together. You'll be in trouble
if you lose this phone.

616
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:15,019
Oh, it was there. I was so out of it.

617
00:45:15,719 --> 00:45:17,519
Pardon? Hello?

618
00:45:17,789 --> 00:45:20,360
Well, I have something to do today.

619
00:45:20,389 --> 00:45:21,889
I'll stop by tomorrow to pick it up.

620
00:45:29,429 --> 00:45:32,630
It looks like Jung Ba Reum has been using
an unregistered phone.

621
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,500
Track down the phone.

622
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:36,139
And find out whom he meets.

623
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:39,369
He's leaving home for work now.

624
00:45:44,449 --> 00:45:46,050
He arrived at work.

625
00:45:47,449 --> 00:45:49,380
I've found the hideout too.

626
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,469
Welcome to my mouse trap, you rats.

627
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:13,480
Hello?

628
00:46:17,079 --> 00:46:19,079
- I can't hear you.
- Where are you?

629
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:20,320
Hello?

630
00:46:22,019 --> 00:46:23,190
Why can't I hear him?

631
00:46:26,019 --> 00:46:27,989
My phone has been copied.

632
00:46:28,019 --> 00:46:29,889
I suggested she should abort the baby
and she said she would do that.

633
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,230
That's why...

634
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:35,199
I had no idea she had the baby.

635
00:46:37,929 --> 00:46:40,369
You knew that my mom gave birth to me.

636
00:46:42,139 --> 00:46:44,409
If you ran a DNA test on my DNA,

637
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,940
and OZ has been following me
since I was little...

638
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:49,849
because they knew
that I had psychopath genes,

639
00:46:49,909 --> 00:46:52,179
that means you're working
with those people.

640
00:46:52,449 --> 00:46:55,250
Then I have to find out...

641
00:46:55,619 --> 00:46:58,050
why you're hiding in here.

642
00:46:58,789 --> 00:47:00,690
If OZ is looking for you,

643
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:03,190
I'll gladly use you as bait.

644
00:47:04,389 --> 00:47:06,559
The way to catch a rat.

645
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,530
Put food that a rat likes on a trap.

646
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:12,469
Oh, it was there. I was so out of it.

647
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:14,940
Well, I have something to do today.

648
00:48:18,829 --> 00:48:21,500
Tell me. Who are you guys?

649
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:23,010
You know me, right?

650
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:25,469
I'm sure you know that I'm a monster.

651
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:29,539
If you don't tell me,
I'll slit his throat, break open his head,

652
00:48:29,809 --> 00:48:31,980
and eat the whole brain.

653
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:33,980
One.

654
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,090
Two.

655
00:48:39,590 --> 00:48:41,119
- Three.
- Hey.

656
00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:45,230
Oh Bong Yi could be abducted
and found dead later.

657
00:48:45,429 --> 00:48:47,300
Or she could get out of the car
in one piece at her destination.

658
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:49,460
It's up to you.

659
00:48:50,570 --> 00:48:51,829
Darn it.

660
00:49:06,579 --> 00:49:07,820
He'll be fine, right?

661
00:49:11,449 --> 00:49:12,619
Okay.

662
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,099
Where did it go?

663
00:49:28,099 --> 00:49:29,199
I left it there.

664
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:33,309
I have to find it.

665
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:40,579
How did it go?

666
00:49:42,619 --> 00:49:43,690
I lost them.

667
00:49:47,789 --> 00:49:48,889
What is it?

668
00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:52,590
I think I left a photo there.

669
00:49:52,989 --> 00:49:54,159
A photo?

670
00:49:54,699 --> 00:49:55,829
What photo?

671
00:49:56,369 --> 00:49:58,530
My little sister Jennifer's photo.

672
00:49:58,869 --> 00:50:00,199
If they find it...

673
00:50:00,769 --> 00:50:01,900
I'll go and get it.

674
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:04,369
I'll bring it.

675
00:50:04,769 --> 00:50:05,840
Stay here for now.

676
00:50:07,739 --> 00:50:10,380
I'm sure of it. He's being chased by them.

677
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:13,579
They even know his family too.

678
00:50:33,199 --> 00:50:34,300
What is this?

679
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:39,269
(Call History)

680
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:51,190
(Professor Lee)

681
00:50:51,449 --> 00:50:52,949
Professor Lee?

682
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:57,690
(Calling)

683
00:50:58,389 --> 00:51:00,500
The first message.

684
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:02,559
Yo Han, it's Joon Sung.

685
00:51:02,829 --> 00:51:04,170
It's Sung Yo Han's phone?

686
00:51:04,670 --> 00:51:08,070
Daniel and Sung Yo Han
were in constant contact?

687
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:11,570
The thing you asked me
to look into. I'm scared.

688
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:13,510
I think I made a mistake.

689
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:16,809
It's a group called OZ.
I'll tell you in person.

690
00:51:20,949 --> 00:51:21,980
What's going on?

691
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:26,219
This means neither Sung Yo Han
or Kim Joon Sung is OZ.

692
00:51:40,269 --> 00:51:41,500
Why is this here?

693
00:51:47,539 --> 00:51:49,010
Then that day...

694
00:51:49,679 --> 00:51:52,010
Sit here for a bit.

695
00:52:17,809 --> 00:52:20,380
That's when I realized
my diary was missing.

696
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:30,150
(October 15, 2019)

697
00:52:30,219 --> 00:52:34,219
(Bloody body... His glare...
Hares, ducks, cats. A different level...)

698
00:52:36,989 --> 00:52:39,460
(Oh, at his gym,
I found something interesting...)

699
00:52:55,809 --> 00:52:58,949
October 17, sunny.
I sliced the rabbit's stomach.

700
00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:02,550
I wanted to see if it was fat
or if it was pregnant.

701
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:07,690
I'm no longer
the best student in my school.

702
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:09,590
"This certificate is to reward..."

703
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:14,000
"your remarkable grade
in the math competition."

704
00:53:17,829 --> 00:53:20,599
Because of the darned new kid
who pretends to be sweet.

705
00:53:25,269 --> 00:53:27,639
That kid is weird.

706
00:53:28,610 --> 00:53:32,110
Everyone else avoids me,
but he's different.

707
00:53:32,949 --> 00:53:34,550
That's why I hate him even more.

708
00:53:36,449 --> 00:53:39,920
But I want to become him.

709
00:53:41,389 --> 00:53:43,119
I want to become like him.

710
00:53:52,699 --> 00:53:54,369
The darned new kid.

711
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:57,010
So what if he's top of the school?

712
00:53:57,969 --> 00:54:00,780
He's an idiot who doesn't know
he's being followed.

713
00:54:02,409 --> 00:54:03,480
That's right.

714
00:54:04,210 --> 00:54:05,909
Someone followed that kid around.

715
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:09,719
He was being tailed and watched.

716
00:54:11,619 --> 00:54:12,820
Was it...

717
00:54:18,730 --> 00:54:21,500
The Mujin serial murders
happened a year ago already.

718
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:23,130
How are you doing?

719
00:54:23,769 --> 00:54:25,969
I'm doing pretty well.

720
00:54:31,269 --> 00:54:35,210
Actually, I tried to take
my own life many times.

721
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:37,710
I could barely breathe.

722
00:54:38,309 --> 00:54:40,980
What crime did I commit
in my previous life...

723
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:44,250
that I lost both my kids in such a manner?

724
00:54:45,590 --> 00:54:47,019
I'm fine now.

725
00:54:47,719 --> 00:54:50,829
I'm doing well.

726
00:54:51,489 --> 00:54:53,500
It's all thanks to him.

727
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,059
Who do you mean?

728
00:54:56,500 --> 00:55:01,070
A thankful person
who gave me the will to live again.

729
00:55:07,179 --> 00:55:08,309
Yes.

730
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:11,309
It was wrong of me to speak that way,

731
00:55:11,579 --> 00:55:13,750
so let's apologize just this time.

732
00:55:16,519 --> 00:55:18,619
You don't even live here.

733
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:20,460
- Why tie your dog...
- I'm sorry.

734
00:55:20,519 --> 00:55:22,420
I couldn't leave it alone at home.

735
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:24,559
My Bok Shil's usually calm.

736
00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:27,130
Take your dog out of here right now!

737
00:55:27,230 --> 00:55:29,360
My baby almost had a fit.

738
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:30,530
Because of your limping mutt.

739
00:55:30,599 --> 00:55:33,199
"A limping mutt?" That's way out of line.

740
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:36,139
- What?
- I thought you had a dirty mouth.

741
00:55:36,239 --> 00:55:37,309
You've got stuffed ears too.

742
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:40,809
We meet again.

743
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:43,980
I went back to see you the next day,

744
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:45,480
but you'd moved.

745
00:55:46,349 --> 00:55:47,519
I had my reasons.

746
00:55:47,619 --> 00:55:50,150
Make her leave with her dog now!

747
00:55:50,289 --> 00:55:51,489
What is wrong with you?

748
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:56,829
- How have you been?
- Take the dog and leave.

749
00:55:56,889 --> 00:56:00,199
She's the VP of the resident association,
and I don't want to upset her.

750
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:02,860
I'm sorry. The mom
I'm babysitting for is on her way.

751
00:56:02,929 --> 00:56:04,829
Can I wait for just 30 minutes?

752
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:07,139
No, you can't. Take the dog and leave.

753
00:56:07,199 --> 00:56:10,610
Then I'll walk Bok Shil for 30 minutes.

754
00:56:11,610 --> 00:56:13,239
Bok Shil, let's go for a walk.

755
00:56:13,510 --> 00:56:15,980
Thank you, Ms. Oh. Can you do that for me?

756
00:56:16,139 --> 00:56:18,050
The mom called to say she's on her way.

757
00:56:18,110 --> 00:56:19,250
Sure. Don't worry.

758
00:56:19,309 --> 00:56:20,420
Thank you.

759
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:25,949
Mister. Can you pass this on to...

760
00:56:26,019 --> 00:56:28,690
the resident of Unit 805?

761
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:30,260
- Unit 805?
- Yes.

762
00:56:31,159 --> 00:56:32,460
Come along.

763
00:56:39,869 --> 00:56:41,000
Bok Shil.

764
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:43,099
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

765
00:56:43,570 --> 00:56:44,840
Bok Shil, it's okay.

766
00:56:44,909 --> 00:56:47,440
- Shouldn't you see a doctor?
- No, I'm fine.

767
00:56:58,349 --> 00:57:00,289
Bok Shil, did you enjoy your walk?

768
00:57:01,059 --> 00:57:02,590
- Thank you.
- It's nothing.

769
00:57:02,659 --> 00:57:05,159
It's been a while since I had a stroll
and I enjoyed it.

770
00:57:05,690 --> 00:57:07,800
- Goodbye, then.
- Wait.

771
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:10,130
Come to my place for dinner.

772
00:57:10,530 --> 00:57:11,769
No, it's fine.

773
00:57:11,829 --> 00:57:15,400
I live nearby. I eat alone anyway.

774
00:57:15,469 --> 00:57:16,909
Join me if it's okay.

775
00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:21,809
You're so cute.

776
00:57:38,929 --> 00:57:41,599
I think it's the same dog.

777
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,170
Dinner's ready. Come over.

778
00:57:49,670 --> 00:57:50,710
Okay.

779
00:57:57,210 --> 00:57:59,349
There's not much to eat
because I live alone.

780
00:57:59,409 --> 00:58:02,079
Gosh, no. It's been a while...

781
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:04,250
since I had home-cooked food.

782
00:58:12,690 --> 00:58:13,760
So...

783
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:16,559
You said your son...

784
00:58:16,630 --> 00:58:19,329
found Bok Shil on a bridge.

785
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:21,900
Do you remember where that was?

786
00:58:23,809 --> 00:58:24,840
It was...

787
00:58:25,309 --> 00:58:26,610
a bridge in Ansin-dong.

788
00:58:27,309 --> 00:58:29,510
We briefly lived in Ansin-dong
a long time ago.

789
00:58:34,179 --> 00:58:36,519
Wasn't that around the time...

790
00:58:36,889 --> 00:58:40,860
when something happened
in the neighborhood?

791
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:44,260
That's right. The Kang Deok Soo assault.

792
00:58:45,289 --> 00:58:47,130
How do you know about that?

793
00:58:49,159 --> 00:58:51,099
Then that dog's...

794
00:58:52,130 --> 00:58:55,500
Your son. Where is he now?

795
00:58:58,309 --> 00:58:59,369
Well...

796
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:04,150
He died. In an accident.

797
00:59:15,019 --> 00:59:16,989
You were a great help today.
Thank you so much.

798
00:59:17,329 --> 00:59:20,190
- No. I should thank you for the meal.
- It was nothing.

799
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,460
- Get home safely.
- I will. Bye.

800
00:59:48,119 --> 00:59:49,159
Oh Bong Yi.

801
00:59:49,989 --> 00:59:51,030
Mister.

802
00:59:51,389 --> 00:59:53,699
Back then, after I was attacked.

803
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:56,900
Didn't you find me
and carry me to the hospital?

804
00:59:59,469 --> 01:00:02,170
I did carry you on my back.

805
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,409
But I didn't find you.

806
01:00:04,610 --> 01:00:05,909
I had gotten a call.

807
01:00:06,469 --> 01:00:08,010
Ansin-dong Substation.

808
01:00:08,039 --> 01:00:10,409
I'm underneath the Ansin-dong bridge.

809
01:00:10,449 --> 01:00:13,949
Hey, kid. Is someone hurt?

810
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:15,420
Please hurry!

811
01:00:15,449 --> 01:00:16,519
Be quick!

812
01:00:19,349 --> 01:00:21,190
Are you okay? Here.

813
01:00:26,659 --> 01:00:27,800
Are you all right?

814
01:00:36,639 --> 01:00:39,670
- Doctor, she's gravely injured.
- This way.

815
01:00:42,610 --> 01:00:44,579
Please bring a towel and a warm blanket.

816
01:00:44,610 --> 01:00:45,780
- Call an orthopedist too.
- Yes, doctor.

817
01:01:05,769 --> 01:01:08,369
Your grandmother and I took his uniform
and went to his school.

818
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,269
But no one stepped up and claimed it.

819
01:01:10,369 --> 01:01:11,570
We never found out.

820
01:01:12,039 --> 01:01:13,309
Why are you suddenly asking me about that?

821
01:01:16,679 --> 01:01:19,409
I met with that boy's mother.

822
01:01:19,849 --> 01:01:21,079
It was a coincidence.

823
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:22,449
Really?

824
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:25,119
Gosh, I guess it was fate.

825
01:01:25,719 --> 01:01:26,849
But...

826
01:01:27,789 --> 01:01:29,960
the boy had died.

827
01:01:31,389 --> 01:01:32,429
Oh, dear.

828
01:01:35,630 --> 01:01:37,230
- Hello?
- We found it.

829
01:01:37,269 --> 01:01:39,000
The car with the license plate 67D 6264.

830
01:01:39,030 --> 01:01:41,139
Okay. I'm sorry, but I have to go.

831
01:01:41,170 --> 01:01:42,800
(Main Building)

832
01:02:12,130 --> 01:02:13,130
(67D 6264)

833
01:02:17,769 --> 01:02:18,969
Did you identify him?

834
01:02:19,639 --> 01:02:20,909
We obtained his fingerprints...

835
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:22,809
because he neither had an ID card
nor a phone on him.

836
01:02:23,139 --> 01:02:24,409
Let me know once you identify him.

837
01:02:27,619 --> 01:02:29,650
The dashcam is missing.

838
01:02:30,650 --> 01:02:32,849
This was murder, not suicide.

839
01:02:43,059 --> 01:02:46,230
The phone is turned off.
Please leave a message.

840
01:02:53,639 --> 01:02:56,210
Detective Shin,
I'll be sending you a number.

841
01:02:56,239 --> 01:02:58,010
Please check it
as well as the base station.

842
01:03:11,730 --> 01:03:14,900
Why would he hang a personal item
in a car that didn't even belong to him?

843
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:22,670
What is this?

844
01:03:25,170 --> 01:03:27,210
There are two storage devices?

845
01:03:30,679 --> 01:03:32,079
What a smart guy.

846
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:34,480
He kept a backup just in case.

847
01:03:35,949 --> 01:03:38,449
You were that girl?

848
01:03:38,849 --> 01:03:42,389
Yes. I just confirmed it at the station.

849
01:03:43,929 --> 01:03:46,130
He found me there, dying.

850
01:03:47,030 --> 01:03:50,769
He reported it to the police
and carried me on his back.

851
01:03:51,670 --> 01:03:55,139
Your son saved my life.

852
01:03:57,170 --> 01:03:58,340
I see.

853
01:03:59,639 --> 01:04:00,880
My son...

854
01:04:02,010 --> 01:04:04,150
never told me about it,

855
01:04:04,550 --> 01:04:05,909
so I had no idea.

856
01:04:07,849 --> 01:04:09,019
Thank you.

857
01:04:09,550 --> 01:04:12,650
I should've thanked him much sooner.

858
01:04:14,389 --> 01:04:18,630
It would've been better
had I expressed my gratitude...

859
01:04:19,059 --> 01:04:20,429
to him.

860
01:04:22,159 --> 01:04:23,230
He was...

861
01:04:24,599 --> 01:04:26,570
He was that type of kid.

862
01:04:26,929 --> 01:04:28,739
He was such a kindhearted boy.

863
01:04:50,489 --> 01:04:52,489
Why did she remove the photos?

864
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:58,099
I think she removed his photo
last time as well.

865
01:04:59,929 --> 01:05:01,369
But why?

866
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:09,309
I'm sure there's a reason.

867
01:05:13,579 --> 01:05:16,420
I'm pretty sure it was around here.

868
01:05:18,050 --> 01:05:19,190
There it is.

869
01:05:38,510 --> 01:05:40,369
I think something was written here.

870
01:05:47,949 --> 01:05:49,449
I'm fine now.

871
01:05:49,650 --> 01:05:51,320
I'm doing well.

872
01:05:51,590 --> 01:05:53,090
I'm eating well as well.

873
01:05:53,590 --> 01:05:55,389
It's all thanks to him.

874
01:05:55,619 --> 01:05:56,760
Who do you mean?

875
01:05:57,260 --> 01:06:01,730
A thankful person
who gave me the will to live again.

876
01:06:03,829 --> 01:06:06,730
Doctor Sung Yo Han.

877
01:06:13,510 --> 01:06:15,340
(Murderer Sung Yo Han)

878
01:06:15,380 --> 01:06:16,480
What?

879
01:06:16,510 --> 01:06:18,679
(Murderer Sung Yo Han)

880
01:06:20,550 --> 01:06:24,389
Sung Yo Han was the one who saved me?

881
01:06:24,519 --> 01:06:27,150
(Murderer Sung Yo Han's house)

882
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:28,920
My lifesaver,

883
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:32,159
who even took in an injured puppy,

884
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:35,030
killed my grandmother?

885
01:06:36,630 --> 01:06:37,699
What?

886
01:06:39,969 --> 01:06:42,570
Right. He was a psychopath.

887
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:45,869
It could've all been an act.
He was pretending to be kind.

888
01:06:46,170 --> 01:06:47,639
That was it.

889
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:49,210
Please don't die.

890
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:51,050
Hang in there.

891
01:06:51,679 --> 01:06:52,710
Don't die.

892
01:06:53,780 --> 01:06:55,679
Think of your family.

893
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:59,820
Think about how heartbroken
your family will be if you die.

894
01:07:00,650 --> 01:07:02,860
Your mom, dad...

895
01:07:04,829 --> 01:07:06,329
Grandma...

896
01:07:11,130 --> 01:07:12,300
No.

897
01:07:13,869 --> 01:07:15,539
He wasn't acting.

898
01:07:17,070 --> 01:07:18,739
He was definitely sincere.

899
01:07:19,639 --> 01:07:21,539
(Murderer Sung Yo Han's house)

900
01:07:21,579 --> 01:07:23,610
How could a psychopath be that way?

901
01:07:24,210 --> 01:07:25,449
It just doesn't make any sense.

902
01:07:26,309 --> 01:07:28,449
But as time went by,

903
01:07:28,679 --> 01:07:30,989
I thought it wasn't Doctor Sung.

904
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:34,090
No. That can't be.

905
01:07:34,820 --> 01:07:35,920
No way.

906
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:38,829
There was solid proof.

907
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:42,400
He tried to kill Ba Reum.

908
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:46,429
He definitely smashed Ba Reum's head
with a hammer.

909
01:07:52,539 --> 01:07:53,969
If it wasn't him,

910
01:07:57,550 --> 01:07:59,750
who killed my grandma?

911
01:08:06,619 --> 01:08:09,190
Okay. The base station is...

912
01:08:09,820 --> 01:08:11,159
in Yongja-dong?

913
01:08:13,059 --> 01:08:14,130
Okay.

914
01:08:15,230 --> 01:08:16,359
I was right.

915
01:08:16,829 --> 01:08:19,430
He was killed last night
while trying to reach me.

916
01:08:51,569 --> 01:08:52,970
This must be him.

917
01:08:55,539 --> 01:08:57,539
Okay. Take a look.

918
01:08:57,670 --> 01:08:58,810
Thank you.

(Homeroom Teacher's Assessment:
Shows slight compulsive behavior)

926
01:09:25,069 --> 01:09:28,170
This "compulsive behavior." What was it?

927
01:09:28,340 --> 01:09:31,340
I'm not too sure. Teachers don't usually
comment on such things.

928
01:09:34,779 --> 01:09:37,680
Does his homeroom teacher still work here?

929
01:09:38,779 --> 01:09:39,850
What?

930
01:09:41,220 --> 01:09:43,050
Has he been tailing Officer Jung
all along?

931
01:09:44,149 --> 01:09:46,350
This is near the bridge
where Bong Yi was found.

Who might you be?

934

Oh, hello. You were Sung Yo Han's
homeroom teacher, right?

935
01:10:20,590 --> 01:10:21,689
I'm busy.

936
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:24,390
I'm busy helping the science club kids
prepare for a contest.

I'm sorry. I'm with the police.

Let me just ask you a quick question.

939
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:34,600
You wrote "compulsive behavior"
on his student record.

940
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,199
Do you remember?

941
01:10:40,270 --> 01:10:41,810
It's because Yo Han said...

942
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:44,279
that he thought that someone was
following him around.

943
01:10:44,579 --> 01:10:46,609
He kept telling me that.

944
01:10:46,779 --> 01:10:48,449
So he had psychotherapy too.

945
01:10:49,119 --> 01:10:52,619
Sung Yo Han was followed by someone
when he was a little boy just like me.

946
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:56,359
My students will be here shortly.

They're lab rats for the contest
