11
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:20,989
What are you looking at? Get lost.

12
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,609
It's a deep cut.

13
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:48,950
It must hurt.

14
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:53,989
I said get lost.

15
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,099
- What are you doing?
- Keep still.

16
00:02:41,169 --> 00:02:44,069
My mom said that
Asiatic pennywort is good for...

17
00:02:44,139 --> 00:02:45,569
cleaning wounds.

18
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,409
Aren't you scared of me?

19
00:02:50,979 --> 00:02:51,979
What?

20
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:55,580
Everyone avoids me
since I cut open the rabbit.

21
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,250
I can't leave behind someone who's hurt.

22
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:04,620
It's really bad to kill animals.

23
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,590
Don't do it again.

24
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:13,159
Why wasn't I born to be a kid like him?

25
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,000
There we go.

26
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:25,039
I want to be like this kid.

27
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,250
I want to...

28
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,379
be this kid.

29
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:37,689
(Mouse)

30
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,120
What now?

31
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,990
I think he's dead.

32
00:03:44,129 --> 00:03:45,199
How does it feel?

33
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,569
You.

34
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:54,939
Isn't it thrilling?

35
00:03:55,909 --> 00:03:57,280
The feel of a kill.

36
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,550
(Episode 11)

37
00:04:14,389 --> 00:04:15,560
What now?

38
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,660
What do I do?

39
00:04:19,129 --> 00:04:20,899
I killed someone.

40
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,000
A man.

41
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,339
No. No, I didn't kill him.

42
00:04:26,769 --> 00:04:27,810
Sung Yo Han.

43
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,610
Sung Yo Han. It's all because of him.

44
00:04:31,709 --> 00:04:33,209
Does that make you feel better?

45
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,389
Do you feel better if you blame me?

46
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:43,759
This is a hallucination.
It's a hallucination.

47
00:04:44,019 --> 00:04:45,689
It's a hallucination. I'm hallucinating.

48
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:48,829
However hard you deny it,
you're just a murderer.

49
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:50,560
A murderer.

50
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:53,129
It was self-defense. It was justified.

51
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:57,740
Yes. Woo Hyeong Cheol
tried to kill me first.

52
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,269
I had no choice.

53
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,009
Self-defense?

54
00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:05,610
Why not be more honest?

55
00:05:07,209 --> 00:05:09,449
The moment he stopped breathing.

56
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:11,319
You relished it.

57
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:17,560
When you strangled him, you felt ecstatic.

58
00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:21,459
No! No.

59
00:05:24,029 --> 00:05:26,360
I'm not like you. I'm different!

60
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:31,899
Look at the state of you.

61
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:36,269
Can you still say that?

62
00:05:39,779 --> 00:05:42,180
Get lost. Please, just get lost!

63
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,910
- This position here.
- Yes.

64
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:11,279
That's where we lost him.

65
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:14,180
- That's Ohchang Interchange.
- Ohchang Interchange is right ahead.

66
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,550
Kim Young Hee and Park Hye Won's bodies
were found here.

67
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,079
It's not far off.

68
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:19,779
Woo Hyeong Cheol's uncle lives here.

69
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,850
- I came to turn myself in.
- Slide a little to the right.

70
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,519
- It's not far away.
- I killed Woo Hyeong Cheol.

71
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,060
We lost the signal here.

72
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:30,329
I killed Woo Hyeong Cheol!

73
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,720
Stay here.

74
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:28,720
What's this?

75
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:31,959
Wait.

76
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,500
Where did he go?

77
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,069
Where did he go?

78
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:55,850
They're here. Stay there.

79
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:03,620
We found neither blood
nor their fingerprints.

80
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,220
This isn't a crime scene.

81
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:10,259
- Didn't you say he got brain surgery?
- Yes.

82
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,800
Apparently, the side effects
aren't predictable.

83
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,129
Hurry and take him to a hospital.

84
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:16,569
Okay. Thanks. Goodbye.

85
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,610
What did he say?

86
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:25,980
I'm telling you the truth.

87
00:08:26,379 --> 00:08:29,079
If not, why would I claim
to have killed someone?

88
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,550
- Officer Jung.
- Near the highway over there,

89
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:33,679
you'll find his car and the truck I drove.

90
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:35,649
Go check. Please check near the highway!

91
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:37,559
We've tracked Woo Hyeong Cheol.
He must've turned his phone on.

92
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:38,690
What?

93
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:40,320
Where is he?

94
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:48,970
It is him.

95
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,970
He's wearing a navy top,
long black pants, and a hiking hat.

96
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,370
That's exactly what he was wearing.

97
00:08:58,139 --> 00:08:59,179
It's him.

98
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:02,879
We looked around
but found no cars or trucks.

99
00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:05,820
No one reported
their trucks missing either.

100
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:12,360
(North Mujin Police Station)

101
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:17,830
Officer Jung, I found this
back at the house.

102
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,200
Your phone.

103
00:09:21,429 --> 00:09:23,899
Would you like me to come with you
to the hospital?

104
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,100
It's okay.

105
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:33,679
You knew, didn't you?

106
00:09:34,309 --> 00:09:37,179
That Woo Hyeong Cheol killed
the female student and the masseuse.

107
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,350
Did he come here?

108
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:43,419
Gosh, why are you asking me again?

109
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,759
The police already checked a while ago.

110
00:09:46,059 --> 00:09:48,789
- "A while ago"?
- That detective who was on TV.

111
00:09:48,929 --> 00:09:50,330
Whose brother died.

112
00:09:50,929 --> 00:09:52,159
Detective Go Mu Chi?

113
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,200
Yes, I knew.

114
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,600
After what you said, I panicked.

115
00:09:56,669 --> 00:09:58,669
I wondered if I had shot
an innocent, young man.

116
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,169
But Kim Jin Ah's body was a bit different.

117
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:03,340
The killer had set Song Soo Ho on fire
while he was still alive,

118
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,009
but she was set on fire
after she had already died.

119
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,009
But most importantly,

120
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:09,379
I found a pile of name cards
at the victim's place.

121
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:10,450
The killer must've taken it.

122
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,320
I spotted the same one on the floor
of Woo Hyeong Cheol's office.

123
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,750
So I ordered someone to tail him...

124
00:10:14,889 --> 00:10:16,649
so that we could arrest him
during his next crime.

125
00:10:16,789 --> 00:10:19,059
But that detective lost him.

126
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:22,190
You should've told me
if you had known already.

127
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,360
That was exactly why
I had gone to the substation.

128
00:10:24,429 --> 00:10:27,100
But after watching that video
of Park Hye Won on your computer,

129
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:29,429
I finally remembered where I saw her.

130
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:31,039
Anyway, we were able to find
Park Hye Won and Kim Young Hee...

131
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:32,669
thanks to you.

132
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:33,840
Good work.

133
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,809
Goodbye.

134
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:39,139
Wait.

135
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,850
Why were you so desperate
to clear Sung Yo Han's name?

136
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,019
You looked really desperate in my eyes.

137
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:54,690
Just because.

138
00:10:57,899 --> 00:10:58,929
Just because...

139
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,860
Hey.

140
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:27,320
How is she?

141
00:11:28,129 --> 00:11:29,929
Thankfully, she has no serious injuries.

142
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,269
Thanks, Ba Reum.

143
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,669
If it wasn't for you, she would've been...

144
00:11:43,009 --> 00:11:45,509
When I heard that you had killed
that scumbag,

145
00:11:47,009 --> 00:11:49,679
I didn't believe it
since you would never do such a thing,

146
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,450
but at the same time, I was relieved.

147
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,289
Scumbags like him...

148
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:00,460
deserve to die.

149
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,730
The real killer of the knot murders...

150
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:07,529
turned out to be the late A's son.

151
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,200
The police have assumed
that Woo Hyeong Cheol...

152
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,799
stowed away on a ship bound
for the Philippines...

153
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,940
and have requested a joint investigation.

154
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:15,570
If not, why would I claim
to have killed someone?

155
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,080
Officer Jung...

156
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:26,179
has been transferred to our team.

157
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:29,019
But he's still hasn't
completely recovered.

158
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:30,450
I'll only assign him desk work
for the time being.

159
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:33,860
I've already informed
Pyeongan Substation, so let him know.

160
00:12:34,429 --> 00:12:35,490
Yes, sir.

161
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,090
The Evidence Storage Team?

162
00:13:10,059 --> 00:13:11,460
Okay. Thank you.

163
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,100
But do you think I'll be okay?

164
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,769
What did the doctor say?

165
00:13:22,309 --> 00:13:23,769
He didn't find anything wrong
in particular.

166
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:26,480
He just said it could be stress-related.

167
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:28,649
Okay. Come to work tomorrow.

168
00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:30,480
Okay. See you tomorrow.

169
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:20,299
Nabi.

170
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,110
Nabi.

171
00:14:33,809 --> 00:14:35,080
Come out and eat.

172
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,080
I'm sorry.

173
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,120
I won't ever do that again.

174
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,149
Okay.

175
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:47,320
You're pregnant.
I'll put this here, so make sure to eat.

176
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,590
Finally, some quiet.

177
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:27,899
What was that?

178
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,240
Was that also an illusion?

179
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:34,539
Oh, that bird?

180
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:38,480
I had told your aunt about it.
I guess she didn't tell you.

181
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:40,639
My aunt?

182
00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:42,879
The kids at the children's ward...

183
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:44,519
found it in the flower garden.

184
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:47,019
They felt sorry for it
and bawled their eyes out,

185
00:15:47,049 --> 00:15:48,350
so we buried it in our backyard...

186
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:49,990
and even gave it a grave.

187
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,070
I killed it.

188
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:04,870
It was me.

189
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,340
Then did I kill Woo Hyeong Cheol as well?

190
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:34,929
You lunatic.

191
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,079
This was it.

192
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:24,880
It... It wasn't an illusion.

193
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:30,819
Then did someone cover it up for me?

194
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:02,019
(The day of the incident)

195
00:19:10,289 --> 00:19:13,089
I think he figured it out.
What do you want me to do?

196
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,500
This station is
North Mujin Police Station.

197
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,230
The next station is Dahong High School.

198
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,200
Please press the button before...

199
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,279
What do I do?

200
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:43,720
Even if I turn myself in,
they'll treat me like a lunatic.

201
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:49,160
No. I should still turn myself in.

202
00:19:54,099 --> 00:19:56,630
So? Are you turning yourself in?

203
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,970
- Pardon?
- Are you turning yourself in?

204
00:20:01,069 --> 00:20:02,269
Jung Ba Reum.

205
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,609
- Sir. Are you okay?
- Yes.

206
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:17,990
This isn't my phone.

207
00:20:20,089 --> 00:20:23,089
- Who are you?
- Do you want to know why...

208
00:20:23,329 --> 00:20:24,430
Woo Hyeong Cheol's corpse disappeared?

209
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:27,160
Who are you?

210
00:20:27,329 --> 00:20:30,630
Let's get into details in person.
But keep this in mind.

211
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,940
No one should know about this.

212
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:37,339
Everyone related to the brain surgery
including your aunt.

213
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:38,809
You must promise.

214
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:42,509
"Brain surgery"? "Aunt"?
He knows everything about me.

215
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,150
Who is this man?

216
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,150
Where shall we meet?

217
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:39,740
You're from the bus station...

218
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,279
(Daniel Lee)

219
00:21:53,349 --> 00:21:55,589
(Professor Lee's sister didn't go missing,
but was murdered.)

220
00:21:57,549 --> 00:21:59,690
("The Police Tentatively Concludes
Daniel Lee Was Murdered by Sung Yo Han")

221
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,559
Professor Lee?

222
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,529
You were killed by Sung Yo Han.

223
00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:11,940
There must be a bigger question
you want to ask.

224
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:15,269
How did Woo Hyeong Cheol's
corpse disappear?

225
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:20,339
Did you get rid of it, then?

226
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:26,650
I... I saw him...

227
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:27,980
getting on a smuggler boat.

228
00:22:28,049 --> 00:22:29,319
Did you check his face?

229
00:22:29,619 --> 00:22:31,859
- No, but his back, clothes, shoes...
- What if...

230
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:35,789
someone in Woo Hyeong Cheol's size
dressed like him...

231
00:22:35,859 --> 00:22:37,460
and caught on CCTV on purpose?

232
00:22:41,299 --> 00:22:44,400
- Does that mean...
- Technically, he did get on the boat.

233
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:45,640
With someone.

234
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:49,170
Of course, he's eaten by fish now.

235
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:50,470
Why...

236
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,210
Who on earth...

237
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:55,450
I'll cut to the chase
and get down to the point.

238
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:01,150
When you killed Woo Hyeong Cheol,
how did it feel?

239
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:06,420
Yes. It was a mistake.

240
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:10,490
He tried to kill me. It was self-defense.

241
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:12,230
Let's be honest.

242
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,500
When you killed Woo Hyeong Cheol,

243
00:23:17,099 --> 00:23:20,700
you probably felt pleasure
you've never felt before.

244
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:28,279
Unfortunately, the killer Sung Yo Han's
frontal lobe...

245
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:31,250
ate away most of your brain
over the last year.

246
00:23:31,549 --> 00:23:34,180
Even at this moment,
it's eating away your brain.

247
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,849
Eventually, your brain will be
completely eaten away...

248
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:39,089
by Sung Yo Han's brain.

249
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,829
What do you think will happen?

250
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,359
Murder is addictive.

251
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:47,859
By killing Woo Hyeong Cheol,

252
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,769
the impulse to kill inside you
has wakened up.

253
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,299
The switch is on.

254
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:55,269
The switch?

255
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:58,839
The impulse will get stronger
as time goes by.

256
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:02,079
Nothing can stop it. No will can.

257
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:14,359
How about you channel
your killing instinct into something else?

258
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,059
Just as you killed Woo Hyeong Cheol,
you can punish the predators,

259
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:19,759
the top one percent of psychopaths.

260
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,700
If you bring me the DNA,

261
00:24:23,769 --> 00:24:25,900
I'll tell you if they're a predator.

262
00:24:28,369 --> 00:24:31,680
Are you telling me to kill other people?

263
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:35,980
But thanks to you,

264
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:39,019
there won't be any more victims
of wrongful death.

265
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:44,289
You must be out of your mind.
You're insane!

266
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:47,660
I'll turn myself in.

267
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:51,230
I'll pay the price
for killing Woo Hyeong Cheol.

268
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:53,359
There's no body or evidence.
How will you do that?

269
00:24:53,829 --> 00:24:56,500
To make them believe
that you killed Woo Hyeong Cheol,

270
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:00,539
you'll have to reveal
that the murderer Sung Yo Han's brain...

271
00:25:00,569 --> 00:25:02,569
took over yours. Are you okay with that?

272
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:05,509
Even if you do, who would believe it?

273
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:08,039
Even if someone believes it,
you'll only live the rest of your life...

274
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:10,779
as a lab rat for scientists
or medical researchers.

275
00:25:10,849 --> 00:25:12,119
Would that be okay?

276
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:18,789
You don't have much time.

277
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:21,890
That switch in your brain will be...

278
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,130
turned on again soon.

279
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,799
You're insane.

280
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,099
You're completely insane.

281
00:25:30,369 --> 00:25:31,769
You'd better listen to me.

282
00:25:33,569 --> 00:25:36,710
Jung Ba Reum. Or else, you will...

283
00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:39,210
kill your family or the ones you love
before anyone else...

284
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,180
for sure.

285
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,630
- Hello?
- Did you get home?

286
00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:04,200
Are you feeling any better?

287
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:06,269
I dropped off some carp extract
at your house.

288
00:26:06,369 --> 00:26:08,509
I heard that it's the best
when you feel weak.

289
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:12,980
Why didn't you tell me
about Eo Beong Yi's death?

290
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:15,480
Ba Reum.

291
00:26:16,049 --> 00:26:18,319
You didn't even recognize me
when you woke up after the surgery.

292
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,549
How could I tell you that?

293
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:25,289
I understand.

294
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:45,480
"The switch will be turned on"?

295
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:53,049
No. That's nonsense. That won't happen.

296
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:59,920
Hey, Officer Jung. You're finally back.

297
00:27:00,089 --> 00:27:01,619
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

298
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:04,789
- Woo Hyeong Cheol's evidence.
- Okay.

299
00:27:06,029 --> 00:27:09,069
Are you going on a blind date?
You're all dressed up.

300
00:27:09,099 --> 00:27:11,630
Why would I go on a blind date
when I'm soon to be married?

301
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,640
Detective Go's going to be the MC.

302
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:14,900
You're getting married?

303
00:27:15,539 --> 00:27:17,440
I didn't give you an invitation.

304
00:27:17,609 --> 00:27:19,609
I'll bring yours
and Inspector Park's next time.

305
00:27:19,779 --> 00:27:20,779
Okay.

306
00:27:20,809 --> 00:27:22,509
Well? Don't I look good?

307
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:24,509
I'm going to be on TV,

308
00:27:24,579 --> 00:27:26,849
so I bought myself a new suit.

309
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,920
You'll be on TV?

310
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:31,720
Tonight at 10pm, Sherlock Hong Ju returns.

311
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:32,920
I'm the first guest of the first show.

312
00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:36,130
Mujin Police Station's hero,
Corporal Shin Sang.

313
00:27:37,529 --> 00:27:40,259
- Ms. Choi got her show back?
- Yes.

314
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,430
That's good to hear.

315
00:27:42,529 --> 00:27:44,299
Why are you doing this without Mu Chi?

316
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,440
- Do you need help?
- No, I can manage on my own.

317
00:27:46,869 --> 00:27:50,470
It would be terrible if I were to
get something on my new suit.

318
00:27:50,509 --> 00:27:52,309
Okay, then I'll get you a soda.

319
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:53,539
No, it's fine.

320
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,509
Is there any loose change lying about?

321
00:27:57,910 --> 00:28:00,250
Why did he stick this down here?

322
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:01,549
I'll buy the soda with this.

323
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:03,849
No, you won't. Freeze.

324
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,420
You drank the instant coffee mix
that was evidence,

325
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:08,490
and you still haven't learned a lesson?

326
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:10,960
Why would you touch this?

327
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:13,960
Is that evidence or something?

328
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:15,900
It's my pay to kill.

329
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,170
What? Your pay to kill?

330
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,440
Yes.

331
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:22,970
A kid gave it to me
and asked me to kill a bad guy.

332
00:28:23,269 --> 00:28:24,609
That's a deposit of sorts.

333
00:28:25,009 --> 00:28:27,579
Today, we looked into
one of the top three unsolved cases,

334
00:28:27,609 --> 00:28:29,750
the gasoline terror.

335
00:28:30,109 --> 00:28:33,579
This time next week, to mark
the first year of Kang Deok Soo's release,

336
00:28:33,619 --> 00:28:36,089
we'll investigate and analyze...

337
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:37,950
the current state of child sex crimes.

338
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,490
See you then.

339
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:41,960
Great job, everyone.

340
00:28:42,029 --> 00:28:44,460
- Great job. Thanks.
- Thank you.

341
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:47,700
Thank you.

342
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:50,069
- You did really well today.
- Not at all.

343
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,539
Next week's theme is child sex crimes.

344
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,609
I majored in child psychology.

345
00:28:56,009 --> 00:28:58,440
It wouldn't hurt for me to appear again.

346
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,880
Sounds good. I'll talk to the writer.

347
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,150
Yes.

348
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:04,250
Shall I come on with Mu Chi?

349
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:05,849
- Detective Go Mu Chi?
- Yes.

350
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:08,549
He put Kang Deok Soo behind bars.

351
00:29:08,589 --> 00:29:11,819
That's why, even now,
he's really close to the victim.

352
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:15,589
Could you take someone in
for about a month?

353
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,529
That's why he said that.

354
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:25,269
Once I find a new place to stay,
I'll come for you right away.

355
00:29:25,369 --> 00:29:27,940
Until then, be a good girl, okay?

356
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:30,670
Okay. Promise you'll come and get me.

357
00:29:32,609 --> 00:29:36,109
If you ever want to see me,
use this to call Bong Yi.

358
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:37,250
Okay?

359
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,420
Whenever you call,
I'll run over and put your mom on.

360
00:29:52,329 --> 00:29:54,000
Thank you. Come by again.

361
00:29:54,029 --> 00:29:55,299
Welcome.

362
00:29:55,369 --> 00:29:57,130
- What do you want? What shall we eat?
- Let's drink.

363
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,470
Welcome.

364
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,500
- Call me when you're ready.
- Okay.

365
00:30:01,539 --> 00:30:03,170
- Shall we order this?
- It's her.

366
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,109
- We're ready to order.
- Okay.

367
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,250
- What can I get...
- It's Oh Bong Yi, isn't it?

368
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:13,750
- I'm begging you...
- Stop it, Grandma.

369
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,460
Sign here.

370
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:32,569
Here's your tip.

371
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:36,339
Leave it, then.

372
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,839
I offered it out of pity.

373
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:44,079
- Are you here for Bong Yi?
- Yes.

374
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,990
Bong Yi.

375
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:53,890
Wake up. Oh Bong Yi.

376
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:56,259
Bong Yi.

377
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:01,859
Ba Reum. It's you, Ba Reum.

378
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:06,099
My dear Ba Reum.

379
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:09,069
You're too good and upright,
just like your name.

380
00:31:14,109 --> 00:31:16,349
So what if you're so good?

381
00:31:16,579 --> 00:31:19,549
You can't even remember
asking me to marry you.

382
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,849
You idiot. You're so stupid.

383
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:29,329
Excuse me. Why did she drink so much?

384
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:32,400
I think they knew each other from school.

385
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:34,930
They talked about some kind of incident...

386
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,430
and how pitiful she was,

387
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:39,240
and then they ended up
pulling each other's hair out in a fight.

388
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,140
An incident?

389
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:52,720
Oh, dear.

390
00:32:09,029 --> 00:32:13,700
My gosh. You eat with such a sweet look.

391
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,369
Good for you.

392
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,539
Grandma.

393
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:23,049
I miss you, Grandma.

394
00:32:44,099 --> 00:32:45,339
Isn't it delectable?

395
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:51,039
Don't you want to press down on her neck?

396
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:54,440
Press down on it.

397
00:32:57,579 --> 00:32:59,849
Feel how soft it is.

398
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:07,220
Feel it. Go on, feel it.

399
00:33:18,099 --> 00:33:19,500
Why are you hesitating?

400
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:24,039
Press. Press down, now.

401
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:33,579
You'd better listen to me.

402
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,690
Or else, you will...

403
00:33:36,089 --> 00:33:38,420
kill your family or the ones you love
before anyone else...

404
00:33:38,789 --> 00:33:40,160
for sure.

405
00:33:58,509 --> 00:33:59,910
Murder is addictive.

406
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:03,609
The impulse will get stronger
as time goes by.

407
00:34:03,809 --> 00:34:06,549
Nothing can stop it.

408
00:34:06,579 --> 00:34:07,650
No will can.

409
00:34:26,139 --> 00:34:27,900
So what if you're so good?

410
00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:31,070
You can't even remember
asking me to marry you.

411
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:34,909
That's so embarrassing.

412
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:43,320
Ba Reum. Your phone, Ba Reum.

413
00:35:01,139 --> 00:35:03,809
My phone. I left it at Bong Yi's.

414
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:18,690
Kang Deok Soo?

415
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:31,630
Are you all right?

416
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:44,710
That punk...

417
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,650
The little thing.

418
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,050
I sent her to get me alcohol.

419
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:54,860
That's when the dreadful thing
happened to her.

420
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,860
I deserve to die for that.

421
00:35:58,389 --> 00:36:00,159
- I deserve to die.
- Ma'am.

422
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,170
- I do.
- It wasn't on you. Don't blame yourself.

423
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:05,329
My poor baby.

424
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:07,599
My puppy.

425
00:36:09,369 --> 00:36:10,440
Officer Jung.

426
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:14,179
Please take good care of my Bong Yi.

427
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:15,679
Will you?

428
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,849
He lives in Bong Yi's neighborhood?

429
00:36:23,349 --> 00:36:25,590
If you bring me their DNA,

430
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:28,820
I'll tell you if they're a predator.

431
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:54,119
What did that man say to you?

432
00:36:56,289 --> 00:36:57,719
Nothing.

433
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:01,159
I just tripped because my shoe came off.

434
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,289
Bong Yi.

435
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,690
This isn't something to take lightly.

436
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,360
Are you here to interrogate me?

437
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:09,000
I know who you are. What is it?

438
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:12,000
Do you want to air this? Don't.

439
00:37:12,269 --> 00:37:15,400
All you care about are viewer ratings,
so you only look for stimulating stories.

440
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,269
You don't care about the victims.

441
00:37:17,539 --> 00:37:20,340
Don't feign righteousness.
That's even crueler.

442
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,550
In my eyes,

443
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:25,250
you and the assailants are just the same.

444
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:29,820
Don't take me the wrong way.
I'm not here to cover a case.

445
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:32,219
Detective Go has been
worried sick about you.

446
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:34,389
- He wanted you to stay at my place.
- Why...

447
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:37,559
Why me? Did I sin?

448
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,929
He's the sinner here,
so why must I run away every time?

449
00:37:41,829 --> 00:37:44,170
I'm no longer the weak girl I used to be.

450
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:48,469
I can hold my own.

451
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:50,210
So please leave.

452
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,039
Please leave this instant.

453
00:39:04,449 --> 00:39:06,820
Look for the psychopath gene.

454
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:10,519
Are you testing me?

455
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:17,860
Why isn't the newbie at work?

456
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,760
Where did he go all of a sudden?

457
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:21,599
Where'd you go?

458
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:25,869
He sure isn't all there just yet.

459
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,940
I should understand.

460
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:42,690
What is it?

461
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:47,420
Kang Deok Soo approached Bong Yi.

462
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:51,090
What? Where?

463
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:54,000
- At her neighborhood.
- He's back?

464
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,869
That scumbag...

465
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:58,530
This is my dashcam footage.

466
00:40:02,809 --> 00:40:05,170
That scumbag. Hey!

467
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,039
Why aren't you doing your job?

468
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:10,409
What's this about?

469
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,380
Kang Deok Soo approached his victim.

470
00:40:12,449 --> 00:40:15,250
He had moved to this area
and reported it a few days ago.

471
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,690
Then you should've kept a close eye on him
at all times!

472
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:19,760
He's currently in our jurisdiction.

473
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,420
This is completely legal.

474
00:40:21,559 --> 00:40:24,190
Are you saying it'd be fine
even if he threatened his victim...

475
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:25,460
since he's still inside this region?

476
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:27,329
Legally speaking, yes.

477
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:30,429
He wasn't given a restraining order
to begin with.

478
00:40:36,139 --> 00:40:37,269
Whose is this?

479
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:43,750
You don't need to know.

480
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:49,349
You must stop him.

481
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:52,420
Those with psychopath genes this pure...

482
00:40:52,489 --> 00:40:55,989
will commit the same crime at all costs.

483
00:40:58,530 --> 00:40:59,860
They will never stop.

484
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:09,269
He will commit even more heinous crimes...

485
00:41:09,539 --> 00:41:10,969
since the crimes
will only evolve with time.

486
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:15,780
(Kang Deok Soo)

487
00:41:24,289 --> 00:41:27,789
Don't you worry.
I'll catch that man no matter what.

488
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:32,429
After my dad passed away,

489
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:37,469
my grandmother started drinking heavily.

490
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:41,170
That night,
she had run out of makgeolli...

491
00:41:41,969 --> 00:41:43,639
and told me to buy some more.

492
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:44,739
Oh, dear.

493
00:41:45,639 --> 00:41:47,280
Is she drinking again at this hour?

494
00:41:47,739 --> 00:41:48,909
Unbelievable.

495
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:51,480
She's the daughter of Mr. Oh...

496
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,980
who fell to his death
at the construction site.

497
00:42:03,929 --> 00:42:04,960
You're going home already?

498
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:07,360
My mother is home alone.

499
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,159
Okay.

500
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:14,699
Someone had tied a puppy to a bridge,

501
00:42:15,969 --> 00:42:17,909
so I went over to set him free.

502
00:42:27,619 --> 00:42:29,519
The puppy.

503
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:31,150
The puppy.

504
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,889
So that's why.

of a Girl in Ansin-dong)

(Rape and assault, Oh Bong Yi)

508
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:55,409
No. Don't fall asleep.

509
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,579
Hey, kid. Don't fall asleep.

510
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:00,619
I'll catch that scumbag for you.

511
00:43:01,619 --> 00:43:02,719
Who is it?

512
00:43:10,889 --> 00:43:12,230
What are you doing?

513
00:43:12,329 --> 00:43:14,059
I was drunk.

514
00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:16,329
I don't remember a thing!

515
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,329
Defendant, please give
your final statement.

516
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:22,940
This is driving me insane.

517
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:26,110
I truly don't remember.

518
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:30,210
Even if I'm completely inebriated
and commit something absurd,

519
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:34,079
how could I ever think
of touching that little girl?

520
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:38,190
I'm not a complete lowlife.

521
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,090
If I'm proven guilty, you may as well...

522
00:43:42,619 --> 00:43:44,559
castrate me.

523
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:48,360
I'm truly innocent.

524
00:44:05,679 --> 00:44:07,579
Judging by the brutality of the crime...

525
00:44:07,619 --> 00:44:09,949
and the defendant has committed
a similar crime in the past,

526
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:11,449
he will be given severe punishment.

527
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:15,090
However, as he has claimed,
I will consider the fact...

528
00:44:15,159 --> 00:44:16,590
that he was inebriated.

529
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:20,360
Therefore, I sentence the defendant,
Kang Deok Soo, to 10 years in prison...

530
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:23,099
and 10 years of probation.

531
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:26,440
What? "10 years"?

532
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:29,369
You... You darn...

533
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:31,239
You scumbag!

534
00:44:31,469 --> 00:44:34,210
You... How could you? That's not right!

535
00:44:34,610 --> 00:44:37,110
What kind of ruling is this?

536
00:44:37,179 --> 00:44:38,550
He deserves to die!

537
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:40,949
That scumbag deserves to die!

538
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,869
Every time it rains, I think of you.

539
00:45:09,809 --> 00:45:11,449
Jung, will you marry me?

540
00:45:12,449 --> 00:45:13,679
I'll be good to you.

541
00:45:36,969 --> 00:45:38,070
What's this?

542
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:40,340
Do you want me to get revenge?

543
00:45:53,059 --> 00:45:56,059
Okay. When he comes out,

544
00:45:56,829 --> 00:45:57,929
I'll kill him for you.

545
00:46:39,099 --> 00:46:40,769
Yes. Keep running. Run.

546
00:46:40,869 --> 00:46:43,309
When I heard that you had killed
that scumbag,

547
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:46,309
I didn't believe it
since you would never do such a thing,

548
00:46:46,539 --> 00:46:48,340
but at the same time, I was relieved.

549
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,679
Scumbags like him deserve to die.

550
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:16,869
Detective, what brings you here?

551
00:47:17,039 --> 00:47:19,780
- What did you say to Bong Yi?
- Pardon?

552
00:47:19,909 --> 00:47:22,610
Don't think of lying to me. You were
caught on camera at the crosswalk.

553
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:26,619
I didn't say anything.

554
00:47:26,949 --> 00:47:29,480
- I just happened to run into her...
- You scumbag!

555
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:33,389
What did you say?

556
00:47:34,389 --> 00:47:35,460
Tell me now.

557
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:39,460
I really didn't say anything.

558
00:47:40,199 --> 00:47:43,230
All I did was greet her like this.

559
00:47:50,869 --> 00:47:53,110
You scumbag. You scum.

560
00:47:53,210 --> 00:47:55,940
I said I will kill you, didn't I?
You scum.

561
00:48:18,429 --> 00:48:21,000
He was going to shoot me.

562
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:22,539
I'm telling you the truth.

563
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:25,809
- I didn't do anything, but he...
- You didn't do anything?

564
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:27,510
Do you know what he said to Bong Yi?

565
00:48:27,539 --> 00:48:28,739
Inspector Bok, that scum...

566
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:30,710
I really didn't do anything.

567
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:34,619
Mom, tell them.

568
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:36,489
You saw everything.

569
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:40,489
It's true. My son didn't do
anything wrong.

570
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:42,590
- And that detective just...
- What's the point of asking her?

571
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:45,090
Of course, she's siding with her son.
It's pointless.

572
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:47,599
I think you're being too harsh.

573
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:50,869
I've been repenting for the past 10 years,

574
00:48:51,269 --> 00:48:53,500
and I plan to atone for my wrongdoings
for the rest of my life.

575
00:48:53,539 --> 00:48:55,900
Well... Please calm down for now.

576
00:48:56,170 --> 00:48:57,670
You can go home now.

577
00:48:57,710 --> 00:48:59,340
We'll be in touch.

578
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:00,579
Why would you let him go?

579
00:49:00,610 --> 00:49:02,780
- Mom, let's go.
- That scum is putting on an act.

580
00:49:04,610 --> 00:49:06,920
Stop acting, you punk.

581
00:49:07,050 --> 00:49:09,019
You can't let him go like this, sir.

582
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:12,420
- Sir! Sir!
- Gosh, seriously.

583
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,969
Detective Shin!
Detective Shin, come over here.

584
00:49:28,539 --> 00:49:31,539
- Why?
- Hey, I think I fell into his trap.

585
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:33,340
He provoked me intentionally.

586
00:49:33,579 --> 00:49:35,010
To keep me away from Bong Yi.

587
00:49:35,679 --> 00:49:37,179
I have a feeling that he'll do something.

588
00:49:37,210 --> 00:49:39,510
That's not possible.
He's wearing an electronic anklet too.

589
00:49:39,550 --> 00:49:41,750
You're wrong, you punk!
Bong Yi is in danger now!

590
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:43,250
Please let me go. I'm begging you.

591
00:49:43,289 --> 00:49:45,920
Where did Officer Jung go?
I told him to stay glued to Detective Go.

592
00:49:45,949 --> 00:49:47,619
- Fine. Then...
- Darn it.

593
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:49,420
Do me just one favor.

594
00:51:25,019 --> 00:51:27,659
(Last Will and Testament)

595
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:34,000
Hey, wake up.

596
00:51:34,159 --> 00:51:35,400
Wake up.

597
00:51:41,099 --> 00:51:42,170
I was wrong.

598
00:51:43,099 --> 00:51:45,010
Kang Deok Soo is not a psychopath.

599
00:51:46,210 --> 00:51:49,210
Even if he used to be one, not anymore.

600
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:51,050
He's been reformed.

601
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:53,250
He repents and atones for his sins.

602
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:05,360
Kang Deok Soo, the culprit
of Ms. Oh's case...

603
00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:07,599
attempted suicide.

604
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:11,530
While some say that he did it
due to social pressure,

605
00:52:11,699 --> 00:52:14,369
others think that there's a chance
that he'll commit a crime again...

606
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,869
considering that his sentence
was reduced...

607
00:52:21,409 --> 00:52:22,940
- Buy it for me.
- No!

608
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:24,780
- Buy it for me!
- Aunt.

609
00:52:24,909 --> 00:52:26,550
- Come on.
- Hi.

610
00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:28,619
- Ba Reum.
- Who is he?

611
00:52:28,650 --> 00:52:30,019
- Come on. Buy it for me.
- Right.

612
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:31,519
You don't remember Hoon Seok, do you?

613
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:34,289
You looked after him very often
when he was a baby.

614
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:37,389
- Please buy it for me. Come on.
- Hoon Seok.

615
00:52:37,429 --> 00:52:39,900
Hoon Seok, I'm your cousin.

616
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:42,829
I can't remember you
because I hurt my head. I'm sorry.

617
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:45,929
- Come on. I want one.
- He's asking for a cat.

618
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,539
He says he can raise it.

619
00:52:47,570 --> 00:52:50,010
- Why don't you let him?
- Come on. Buy it for me.

620
00:52:50,039 --> 00:52:53,010
I'll buy you a stuffed doll instead,
a stuffed cat.

621
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:55,179
No, I want a real cat.

622
00:52:55,309 --> 00:52:58,510
- How about I buy you something delicious?
- A real cat.

623
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:00,119
It's 27 dollars.

624
00:53:01,349 --> 00:53:03,690
Eat up. Hoon Seok.

625
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:07,420
I have a cat.
Do you want to see its photo?

626
00:53:08,289 --> 00:53:09,360
Here.

627
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:13,829
Cool. I want to go to your house
to see it. I'll go there.

628
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:14,900
Really?

629
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:17,670
Then come to see my cat
after she has babies, okay?

630
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:18,900
I'll call you.

631
00:53:18,929 --> 00:53:21,469
Really? Pinky promise.

632
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:22,969
Pinky promise.

633
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,570
Now, eat up.

634
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,809
Here. I bought this instead of a cat.

635
00:53:31,110 --> 00:53:32,280
Wow.

636
00:53:35,179 --> 00:53:37,320
Right. I can overcome it.

637
00:53:38,190 --> 00:53:40,360
I'll prove Professor Lee wrong.

638
00:53:41,219 --> 00:53:43,190
I'll never lose to Sung Yo Han.

639
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,829
- Hello.
- Hello.

640
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:51,929
Detective Go assaulted Kang Deok Soo
and got locked up in a holding cell.

641
00:53:52,369 --> 00:53:53,469
What?

642
00:53:55,170 --> 00:53:59,039
Here. He asked me to give you this
and tell you to carry it all the time.

643
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:11,989
This is the weather report.

644
00:54:12,019 --> 00:54:15,489
The high pressure over China
and the low pressure over Kyushu, Japan...

645
00:54:15,519 --> 00:54:19,360
will create a strong east wind
on the eastern coast.

646
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:23,300
As a result, starting this weekend,
it will rain in the inland areas...

647
00:54:23,329 --> 00:54:24,570
accompanied by lightning and thunder.

648
00:54:24,599 --> 00:54:25,730
Thank you for watching.

649
00:54:26,329 --> 00:54:27,469
Look forward to it.

650
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:29,539
I'll go to see you on a rainy day.

651
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:40,380
Gosh, it's raining cats and dogs.

652
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:41,420
I know, right?

653
00:54:41,449 --> 00:54:42,650
It's annoying.

654
00:54:42,719 --> 00:54:43,889
Whenever it rains...

655
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:48,789
Hey, is it raining? Is it raining now?

656
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:51,630
Let me... Let me out now.

657
00:54:51,730 --> 00:54:52,860
Ki Hyuk!

658
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:55,530
Hey, Golden Boy! Inspector Bok!

659
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:01,940
Oh, right. I should feed her.

660
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:08,539
Oh, your babies were born already.

661
00:55:14,449 --> 00:55:15,519
How cute.

662
00:55:16,650 --> 00:55:19,150
- Ba Reum.
- Hi, Hoon Seok.

663
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:21,059
Why are you answering her phone?
Where's your mom?

664
00:55:21,090 --> 00:55:23,489
Mom went to see Grandma.

665
00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:27,300
She left in tears
saying that Grandma is sick.

666
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:29,429
And she left her phone at home.

667
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:30,769
Your grandmother?

668
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,500
Yes, my grandma in Jeju Island.

669
00:55:33,670 --> 00:55:35,039
In Jeju Island?

670
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:38,139
Then are you alone now?

671
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:40,340
No. The helper is home too.

672
00:55:40,679 --> 00:55:43,340
She's taking a nap in her room.
She's snoring.

673
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:46,480
Hoon Seok, watch this.

674
00:55:48,579 --> 00:55:50,250
Oh, my. It's so cute.

675
00:55:50,349 --> 00:55:52,320
Ba Reum, I want to go to your house
to see it.

676
00:55:52,619 --> 00:55:55,360
- Do you want to come over?
- I want to see it.

677
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:56,929
Okay. I'll go and pick you up.

678
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,030
Get dressed.

679
00:55:58,289 --> 00:55:59,929
What's your address?

680
00:56:00,030 --> 00:56:01,800
- Hold on.
- Okay.

681
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:09,400
1-301, Mujin Apartment,

682
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:12,739
Mujin-dong, Mujin-si.

683
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:14,510
Okay. Got it.

684
00:56:17,710 --> 00:56:18,809
Mujin-dong?

685
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:21,050
Don't they live in Pyeongan-dong?

686
00:56:21,949 --> 00:56:23,019
That's odd.

687
00:56:23,219 --> 00:56:25,789
Yes. I'm on my way to the shoot.

688
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:29,389
Last time, my face was puffed up and ugly.

689
00:56:31,489 --> 00:56:33,599
I'll call you back later.

690
00:56:35,429 --> 00:56:37,230
Ma'am, why are you out here?

691
00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:39,769
Well...

692
00:56:41,199 --> 00:56:43,039
Can you let the detective go?

693
00:56:45,269 --> 00:56:47,440
Deok Soo lied.

694
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:49,710
- What?
- The detective...

695
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:51,780
came by and got angry,

696
00:56:52,309 --> 00:56:55,250
so my son got upset and lied.

697
00:56:56,349 --> 00:56:58,550
The detective did nothing wrong.

698
00:56:59,150 --> 00:57:00,289
Let him go.

699
00:57:00,989 --> 00:57:02,059
I'm...

700
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:05,659
I'm so sorry.
I did a terrible job raising my son.

701
00:57:07,099 --> 00:57:09,559
Here. Just in case,

702
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,400
I wrote a statement too.

703
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:22,579
Goodbye, then.

704
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:28,920
(The detective didn't mean to shoot.
My son lied. Deok Soo isn't remorseful.)

705
00:57:35,190 --> 00:57:36,590
Detective Lee.

706
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:40,090
Pass this to Inspector Bok.
I have a show to shoot. Thanks in advance.

707
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:49,369
Auntie, I'm taking Hoon Seok to my place.

708
00:57:49,739 --> 00:57:51,269
Call me when you see this.

709
00:58:06,519 --> 00:58:09,889
12 years ago today,
when the dreadful incident occurred,

710
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:11,030
it rained then too.

711
00:58:11,590 --> 00:58:14,730
Kang Deok Soo was released
one year ago today.

712
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:17,099
I'll ask you point blank.

713
00:58:17,429 --> 00:58:20,469
If an offender wears an electronic anklet,
are the children safe?

714
00:58:20,639 --> 00:58:23,440
Since Kang Deok Soo's offense,
the laws were revised,

715
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,170
and monitoring was strengthened.

716
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:27,440
Criminals who are
highly likely to re-offend...

717
00:58:27,610 --> 00:58:29,679
can be put on a personal watch.

718
00:58:30,309 --> 00:58:32,110
He has been out for a year,

719
00:58:32,179 --> 00:58:34,920
and nothing has happened so far,
but can we rest assured?

720
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:37,090
Everyone watches them carefully
for the first six months.

721
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:40,789
But like now, after a year or so,
people begin to let their guards down.

722
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:43,730
They think the criminal is
reformed and rehabilitated.

723
00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:46,760
But they're biding their time.

724
00:58:47,199 --> 00:58:50,730
When our guard is dropped,
they prepare to offend again.

725
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,769
That is when they are most dangerous.

726
00:58:58,909 --> 00:59:00,110
Slow down.

727
00:59:05,809 --> 00:59:07,380
They're so cute.

728
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:09,880
They're cute, aren't they?

729
00:59:13,989 --> 00:59:16,590
The cat must not like you.

730
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:20,400
No. It's because
it has babies and is wary.

731
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:24,170
Aren't you hungry?
I'll cook you something.

732
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:59,300
Yes, officer.

733
00:59:59,769 --> 01:00:01,699
I'm at a pharmacy.

734
01:00:02,139 --> 01:00:04,539
I'm out of the medicine
the hospital doctor...

735
01:00:04,969 --> 01:00:06,309
prescribed me.

736
01:00:06,369 --> 01:00:08,039
A sexual offender's movements...

737
01:00:08,579 --> 01:00:11,849
are monitored 90 percent of the time
solely by a phone call.

738
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:15,519
Is it good?

739
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:17,590
- Yes.
- Eat all you want.

740
01:00:18,119 --> 01:00:19,219
Okay.

741
01:00:35,099 --> 01:00:37,039
What's wrong? Do you feel sick?

742
01:00:41,079 --> 01:00:43,880
No, Hoon Seok. I'll cut up
some more food for you.

743
01:00:48,820 --> 01:00:51,889
I'll show you why
I trained so hard in martial arts.

744
01:00:53,289 --> 01:00:54,460
Kang Deok Soo.

745
01:01:08,369 --> 01:01:10,139
What's this? Shoot.

746
01:01:10,409 --> 01:01:13,780
It's the Probation Office Situation Room.
Kang Deok Soo's anklet is damaged.

747
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:14,909
Pick him up immediately.

748
01:01:16,539 --> 01:01:18,880
Kang Deok Soo's phone
is headed in the same direction.

749
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:21,119
He's exiting Muchang Interchange.

750
01:01:35,099 --> 01:01:38,869
A child sex offender Kang Deok Soo
who was released a year ago...

751
01:01:38,929 --> 01:01:41,070
cut off the electronic anklet
and ran away.

752
01:01:41,369 --> 01:01:43,000
The police traced him,

753
01:01:43,139 --> 01:01:45,610
and he's headed toward
Jeongsun in Gangwon Province.

754
01:01:45,670 --> 01:01:46,809
What? He ran away?

755
01:02:01,489 --> 01:02:02,960
You're watching Sherlock Hong Ju.

756
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:07,199
I'm a fan of Choi Hong Ju.

757
01:02:07,699 --> 01:02:09,500
I saw an interview somewhere.

758
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:12,030
She's an orphan, but she studied hard...

759
01:02:12,099 --> 01:02:13,630
and got where she is now.

760
01:02:14,199 --> 01:02:16,170
By the way, Yu Na was here.

761
01:02:16,699 --> 01:02:18,969
Yu Na? When?

762
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:22,610
Around dinnertime.
She bought some bread for her mom.

763
01:02:22,909 --> 01:02:25,349
- Child sex offenders like pedophiles...
- Yu Na...

764
01:02:25,579 --> 01:02:26,909
never change.

765
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:30,519
Their sole interest is young children.

766
01:02:32,389 --> 01:02:34,289
What is your name?

767
01:02:50,909 --> 01:02:54,409
Ba Reum, let's play.
Let's play with the cats.

768
01:02:54,739 --> 01:02:56,510
Hang on, Hoon Seok.

769
01:02:57,110 --> 01:02:59,679
Ba Reum, I want to play.

770
01:02:59,750 --> 01:03:01,719
Let's play hide and seek.

771
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:04,090
I want to play hide and seek.

772
01:03:08,219 --> 01:03:11,829
I'll hide. Count to 100 and look for me.

773
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:25,039
He's so noisy.

774
01:03:25,670 --> 01:03:26,940
It's annoying.

775
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:51,329
Good job.

776
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:53,570
I could've done better.

777
01:03:54,070 --> 01:03:55,099
Where's Detective Go?

778
01:03:56,139 --> 01:03:59,610
The thing is... He's locked up.

779
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:01,510
He's what?

780
01:04:05,650 --> 01:04:08,650
Hey, hey. Ki Hyuk. Ki Hyuk.

781
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:11,519
Let me out. Bong Yi's in danger.

782
01:04:11,590 --> 01:04:13,119
Bong Yi's in danger!

783
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:16,760
Ki Hyuk. Turn a blind eye just this once.
There's no one else here.

784
01:04:17,590 --> 01:04:19,630
I'll say I stole the key and escaped.

785
01:04:19,889 --> 01:04:21,699
I'll say I stole it.

786
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:29,570
Thanks a lot.

787
01:04:29,639 --> 01:04:32,769
The moment you use that to
get out to save Bong Yi,

788
01:04:33,139 --> 01:04:34,679
you will lose your job.

789
01:04:35,010 --> 01:04:37,750
Make up your mind.
Is it Han Seo Joon or Oh Bong Yi?

790
01:04:55,329 --> 01:04:57,900
You'd better hide.

791
01:04:58,130 --> 01:05:00,639
I can see your hair.

792
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:04,840
He's really bad at finding people.

793
01:05:05,110 --> 01:05:06,440
He's stupid.

794
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:17,849
Can rain be that switch?

795
01:05:18,719 --> 01:05:20,420
Yu Na! Yu Na!

796
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:24,059
Yu Na.

797
01:05:27,860 --> 01:05:30,670
Ma'am. Where's Yu Na?

798
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:14,409
If you ever want to see me,
use this to call Bong Yi.

799
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:18,809
(Recipient: Lee Jeong Ran)

801
01:06:21,820 --> 01:06:23,920
(This is Bong Yi.)

802
01:06:24,820 --> 01:06:25,889
It wasn't me.

803
01:06:26,489 --> 01:06:27,820
He was after Yu Na from the get-go.

804
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:33,860
Hello?

805
01:06:34,130 --> 01:06:36,260
This is 52 Ansin-dong.

806
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:38,599
Please hurry! Kang Deok Soo
has abducted a child!

807
01:06:48,280 --> 01:06:49,679
No. Yu Na.

808
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:52,449
Yu Na.

(Officer Jung Ba Reum)

810
01:07:19,510 --> 01:07:21,340
Why are you here at this hour?

811
01:07:21,380 --> 01:07:23,340
We received a call
about your missing child.

812
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:24,610
My daughter?

813
01:07:26,809 --> 01:07:28,349
She's sleeping over there.

814
01:07:29,519 --> 01:07:32,150
Who in the world made that prank call?

815
01:08:33,550 --> 01:08:34,579
Darn it!

816
01:08:35,220 --> 01:08:36,250
Hey!

817
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:56,859
Save Yu Na.

818
01:10:57,930 --> 01:11:00,689
Please save her.

819
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:05,869
Save... Save Yu Na. Save her.

820
01:11:24,949 --> 01:11:27,250
You'd better listen to me, Jung Ba Reum.

821
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:37,829
Or else, you will kill...

822
01:11:38,829 --> 01:11:41,170
your family or the ones you love
before anyone else...

823
01:11:41,470 --> 01:11:42,739
for sure.
