(The animal scenes are CGI.)

9
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm disappointed you have
so little trust in me.

10
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:36,210
How about now? Do you trust me now?

11
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:39,509
Don't forget.
You have until the end of the show.

12
00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:42,450
If you don't say
why this boy dies before then,

13
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,950
this boy will not be able to
return to his mother.

With permission from
their families, we'll release...

00:01:06,569 --> 00:01:07,810
the victims' faces and names.

(The Predator's Victims)

19
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:11,909
To save Han Guk and catch the culprit,

20
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:14,209
tips from the public are most important,

21
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,250
so the victims' families
made the difficult decision.

22
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,689
Kim, the homeless man,

23
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,989
has not yet been identified,
so we drew a composite based on...

24
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,459
the shape of his skull and statements...

25
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:29,189
from other homeless people.

26
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:39,739
Why did you go digging again?

27
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,609
Did you go up the mountain again?

28
00:01:47,709 --> 00:01:51,280
Ladies and gentlemen.
Even the smallest tip will do.

29
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:55,349
If you have any information,
do not hesitate to call us.

(The Predator's Victims)

31
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:57,890
Detective Go.

32
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,390
Don't these serial killings
have a certain characteristic?

33
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:03,799
They do. There was
a church cross nearby...

34
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:05,200
every murder scene.

35
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,569
The victims' middle fingers
were bent towards the cross.

36
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,969
The culprit detests the deity...

37
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:13,199
or has a very strong sense of repulsion.

38
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,439
You said...

39
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:17,080
I'm certain that the killer
who murdered that gym director...

40
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,479
is responsible for this murder as well.

41
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:22,479
You estimated gym director Song Soo Ho
and Byun Soon Young...

42
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,280
were murdered by the same person.

43
00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:26,780
- That turned out to be true.
- Yes.

44
00:02:26,889 --> 00:02:29,590
Song Soo Ho was killed
because of a grudge.

45
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,419
That woke his killer instinct.

46
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:34,259
I would say he killed
the bar worker randomly.

47
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,530
You also said
there would be more random killings.

48
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,659
Yes.

49
00:02:39,229 --> 00:02:42,300
Out of the seven victims,
other than Song Soo Ho...

50
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:46,069
and the Gudong woman in her 70s
who died because she saw the killer,

51
00:02:46,169 --> 00:02:48,810
the murders and attempted murder
of the other five victims...

52
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,210
were at first...

53
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,810
assumed to be random, unrelated incidents.

54
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:55,979
But then the suspect called you in person.

55
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,620
That's right. I have
my own victim selection criteria.

56
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,650
He told you himself that
these five incidents...

57
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:02,889
were not random.

58
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:04,520
Yes. After talking to the killer,

59
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:07,030
I looked through these cases again.

60
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:09,789
The victims' addresses, schools,
workplaces, hometowns, etc.

61
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,830
I searched thoroughly
to find a connection,

62
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,270
but I found nothing to tie them together.

63
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:19,069
Then I thought that maybe
I was focused too much on the cases.

64
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,139
I went back to learn more about
the victims' surroundings.

65
00:03:24,409 --> 00:03:27,949
Mr. Jang says he just wants one drink.

66
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:31,150
Do you know how many buildings he owns?

67
00:03:31,219 --> 00:03:33,349
Grin and bear with it
and sit next to him for just one drink.

68
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:35,949
- Just keep him in a good mood.
- I don't want to!

69
00:03:36,289 --> 00:03:38,990
Even if I starve, I won't do anything
that'll embarrass my Min Ji.

70
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,930
Fine, then. Save your virtue...

71
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,300
and starve to death.

72
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,770
Why are you bothering her
when she said no?

73
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,629
You're not the only one who'll starve.

74
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:51,699
- Your daughter will too!
- Get out of the kitchen.

75
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:16,060
After Byun Soon Young's husband died,

76
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:18,959
she worked in the kitchen of a bar...

77
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,100
and struggled to raise her daughter.

78
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,639
Park Jong Ho was a young man
without a stable job...

79
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,439
who worked day and night.

80
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:37,279
Hey.

81
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,420
We found a packet of
instant coffee at the scene.

82
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:44,019
To him, the instant coffee mix
wasn't just something he favored.

83
00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:46,790
It was a survival tool
he used to stay awake.

84
00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:51,160
The killer took his victims'
most important belongs like a trophy.

85
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,800
He'll have known very well
what coffee mix meant to Park Jong Ho.

86
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:55,970
(Too bad. He was my age.)

87
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:57,769
(A madman's killing people everywhere.)

88
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,199
(Get him quick.
Why can't you in this day and age?)

89
00:04:59,269 --> 00:05:00,810
(Is he going after the pitiful and poor?)

90
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:03,139
(There's no point in working.
Let's just play!)

91
00:05:03,209 --> 00:05:04,310
(RIP. He was so young.)

(Sherlock Hong Ju)

93
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,250
Prison officer Na Chi Gook,
the only survivor...

94
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:12,050
was nicer and kinder than most.

95
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,790
His acquaintances say...

96
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,949
he would never walk on
if he saw injustice.

97
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:20,459
As a teenager, he even saved a person
who was being beaten up.

98
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:23,529
(Ant Boy's Escape from the Bottom)

99
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:26,300
Kim the homeless man
who is yet to be identified...

100
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,800
was very popular among
his fellow homeless men.

101
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:32,600
He was a quiet man.

102
00:05:33,069 --> 00:05:36,509
And when he ever had some food...

103
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:39,740
We got an important call.
He wants to talk directly to you,

104
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:42,110
but he requested we change his voice.

105
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,350
He's afraid the killer will identify him.

106
00:05:44,649 --> 00:05:47,089
- And Cho Mi Jeong...
- Hello, I'm Mi Jeong.

107
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:50,959
was a frail university student
who weighed about 40kg.

108
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:53,930
She was poor,

109
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,329
so to make a living and earn her tuition,

110
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:59,300
she ate food for people to watch online.

111
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:02,399
As you see, all these victims...

112
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:06,540
were socially disadvantaged, good people.

113
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:13,439
We're getting a lot of calls.

114
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:14,980
Let's talk to a caller.

115
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,920
You have important information
on the case?

116
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,589
It's not about the case.

117
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:25,189
I have a question for Detective Go Mu Chi.

118
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,290
I'll ask point-blank.

119
00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:29,459
Detective Go Mu Chi.

120
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:32,560
Do you think you deserve to be on TV?

121
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:36,029
- If it's not about the case...
- There's talk that...

122
00:06:36,069 --> 00:06:37,670
you frequent gambling dens...

123
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:38,870
and take bribes from criminals.

124
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:40,939
Is that true?

125
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,939
I don't know where you heard that,
but those are groundless rumors.

126
00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:47,980
Let's say they are. Then...

127
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:51,050
what about the rumor
the Headhunter killed your family?

128
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,490
- Air his real voice.
- No.

129
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,920
- I promised I'd alter his voice.
- Something's not right.

130
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:02,689
- I'll take the blame. Air his voice.
- I asked a question.

131
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,930
Am I right?

132
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:07,230
What does that have to do with this case?

133
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,870
- That rumor must be true.
- Undo the voice-altering software.

134
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,569
I did undo it,

135
00:07:11,769 --> 00:07:13,970
but the caller's
altering his voice from his end.

136
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:18,339
The Headhunter
beheaded your mom in front of you.

137
00:07:20,779 --> 00:07:22,410
That must've traumatized you.

138
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,019
- Track the number.
- Not long ago,

139
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:26,149
a killer you chased jumped from a roof.

140
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:29,050
Did he really jump?

141
00:07:30,019 --> 00:07:32,420
Did you not push him?

142
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,259
I did not.

143
00:07:34,689 --> 00:07:37,329
I was kidding. Of course, you didn't.

144
00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:39,759
Would a detective kill someone?

145
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:44,000
But you wanted to deep inside,
hundreds and thousands of times, right?

146
00:07:45,269 --> 00:07:46,600
You can't answer.

147
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:49,870
- Silence is what? An affirmative.
- Is the detective crooked?

148
00:07:50,209 --> 00:07:52,079
Right? You're doing this...

149
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,350
to kill the serial killer, aren't you?

150
00:07:54,449 --> 00:07:57,750
You don't care what happens to
the missing boy, do you?

151
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:01,649
You're holding back pretty well.

152
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:05,790
I called you tonight because...

153
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,089
I'm worried about you.

154
00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:10,959
You can't control yourself
whenever you see a killer,

155
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,899
and you're on TV
trying to save someone's son.

156
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:16,269
You're worried?
Worry about yourself, you lunatic.

157
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,670
You son of a witch.

158
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,639
- Hang up.
- Did you just curse?

159
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,610
You got so riled up over
some honest advice from a viewer,

160
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:27,379
and you should be calmer than most
when you face a killer.

161
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:37,559
(He cursed on TV. That's huge.)

162
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:38,659
(Is he out of his mind?)

163
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:39,690
(I wish I hadn't heard that.)

164
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:41,960
- Is he crazy?
- What cop does that?

165
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:44,559
- What a mess.
- My gosh.

166
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,299
What a nutcase.

167
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,529
Detective Go, why didn't you say
your family was the Headhunter's victims?

168
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:01,509
Why did you curse on live TV?

169
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:04,250
People everywhere want you gone.

170
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:07,549
They say they don't trust you.
They think...

171
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,590
you'll get Han Guk in danger
and want you off the set.

172
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:12,559
We're about to explode here!

173
00:09:12,789 --> 00:09:14,690
What'll you do now?

174
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:17,759
Let's take a break.

175
00:09:18,629 --> 00:09:19,730
That's true.

176
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,700
I lost...

177
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,509
both my parents to
the much-talked-about Headhunter...

178
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,450
25 years ago.

179
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,480
If only I get the chance to,

180
00:09:37,549 --> 00:09:39,480
I want to kill the man
who killed my parents.

181
00:09:40,049 --> 00:09:41,620
That's honestly how I feel.

182
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,590
I understand why...

183
00:09:51,529 --> 00:09:54,330
you think I'm doing this show
for a personal grudge...

184
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,899
so I can catch and kill
people like the Headhunter.

185
00:09:58,039 --> 00:09:59,470
But please believe me.

186
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:02,570
The only reason I'm doing this show
is to save Han Guk.

187
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:05,679
This show is the only way
we can save Han Guk.

188
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:08,980
Please help me continue.

189
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,379
I apologize.

190
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:14,419
I won't let my emotions
get the best of me anymore.

191
00:10:15,419 --> 00:10:16,649
I promise you.

192
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:23,059
(Sherlock Hong Ju)

193
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,100
The delivery has arrived.

194
00:10:27,129 --> 00:10:30,429
They say an object confirmed
to be from the criminal...

195
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:31,970
has arrived at the studio.

196
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:32,769
(To Detective Go)

197
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:11,210
Okay. We've just watched
the footage in the flash drive...

198
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,779
that was presumably sent by the culprit.

199
00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:16,980
(Detective Go, please don't swear!)

200
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,750
We request minors or those
who are weak of heart...

201
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,820
to refrain from watching
the following footage.

202
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,019
(Call 1556-3556 to report.)

203
00:11:33,629 --> 00:11:34,899
Do you finally believe me?

204
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:38,169
The deadline is the time the show ends.

205
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,950
If you fail to tell me the reason why
this kid needs to die by then,

206
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:52,049
you'll see a spectacle
that you'll never forget.

207
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:55,720
We have yet to confirm whether
the sender is the real culprit.

208
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:57,559
That's because the kid is wearing a mask,

209
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:00,559
so we cannot confirm
whether or not it's Han Guk.

210
00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:06,399
That's it.

211
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:10,600
This kid is wearing
the same Goatman mask...

212
00:12:10,669 --> 00:12:13,340
- and outfit as Han Guk.
- Han Guk...

213
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:15,470
However, this isn't enough proof.

214
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:17,740
We'll confirm it with his mother.

215
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:19,879
Is this kid in the footage...

216
00:12:20,509 --> 00:12:21,879
your son?

217
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,480
Yes. It's Han Guk.

218
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,279
Are you sure?

219
00:12:28,049 --> 00:12:30,090
I can recognize my own son.

220
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:32,389
- I'm here to deliver a parcel.
- It is my son.

221
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:34,730
Detective Go has received another parcel.

222
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,480
What's wrong? What are they doing?

223
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:01,190
- Yes?
- That's not the one I sent.

224
00:13:01,419 --> 00:13:03,789
What? What do you mean?

225
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,919
(8pm, 2 hours before the airing)

226
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:11,629
It's 8pm, 2 hours before we go live.

227
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,559
We're done for.

228
00:13:34,049 --> 00:13:35,419
Let's do it.

229
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:40,320
- What?
- Let's gamble.

230
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,759
What have we got to lose?

231
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:45,230
I remember a killer being enraged
when the news reported his deeds...

232
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:48,299
as that of another killer's.

233
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:51,000
You're right. Killers like this one
are exhibitionists...

234
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:54,509
and can't stand it if someone else
takes the spotlight instead of them.

235
00:13:55,409 --> 00:13:57,909
Let's create a fake and provoke him.

236
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,809
A fake Han Guk.

237
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,779
(9pm, 1 hour before the airing)

238
00:14:01,809 --> 00:14:03,279
Doesn't he look exactly the same?

239
00:14:05,549 --> 00:14:08,990
Gosh, he looks exactly the same
with the clothes and the mask.

240
00:14:09,019 --> 00:14:10,549
Dong Goo, good going.

241
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:11,960
Where did you find that boy?

242
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:14,330
My girlfriend teaches
potential child actors.

243
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,659
My son is excellent
at pretending to be scared.

244
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:19,559
You know you should pay in cash, right?

245
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:24,740
Please keep this a secret.

246
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:28,139
Of course. My son's life is at stake.

247
00:14:28,809 --> 00:14:30,070
Will you be able to do it?

248
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,110
Once the footage is revealed,
I'll be asking you a question.

249
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:36,509
I just need to confirm
that it's my boy, right?

250
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:38,419
Correct.

251
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:40,279
Let's go. We only have an hour left.

252
00:14:41,019 --> 00:14:42,919
Here. You can do it, right?

253
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:44,190
Yes. Don't worry about it.

254
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,029
I'm disappointed you have
so little trust in me.

255
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,529
How about now? Do you trust me now?

256
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:01,639
He just left.

257
00:15:02,909 --> 00:15:04,139
(Mujin Police Station)

258
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,409
Why is he just standing there?

259
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,409
That's not the footage I sent.
It's a different one.

260
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:10,980
I knew something wasn't right.

261
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,090
(Call 1556-3556 to report.)

262
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,659
The delivery guy. It's that scumbag.

263
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,559
(Call 1556-3556 to report.)

264
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:25,059
Talk. Ms. Choi, hurry up.

265
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:27,500
- Gosh, what's going on?
- Okay.

266
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:30,100
We just watched the footage
that was presumably sent...

267
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:31,669
by the culprit.

268
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:35,070
Detective Go has left temporarily
to confirm it.

269
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:37,980
We'll continue to receive any reports.

270
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:13,610
You.

271
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,070
It's not me! I'm just a delivery guy!

272
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,340
Call my company and ask them.

273
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:43,210
Then why did you run away, you scumbag?

274
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,980
I was scared.

275
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:46,779
I saw the news.

276
00:16:46,809 --> 00:16:49,879
I didn't want to get involved in it.

277
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:50,980
You dirtbag.

278
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:56,019
- It's a burner phone.
- Sorry?

279
00:16:56,789 --> 00:16:59,019
Where did you pick up the parcel?

280
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:00,659
The sender had put it
in one of the storage lockers...

281
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:02,289
at Simjeon Station.

282
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,660
- "Simjeon Station"?
- Yes.

283
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:07,799
Now, may I go?

284
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,369
Let me confirm it first.

285
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:11,700
I'll go check the CCTV.

286
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:13,940
You should go back inside.
You're still on air.

287
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,940
- Will you be okay?
- I will.

288
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,210
- Go with him.
- Okay.

289
00:17:19,309 --> 00:17:20,440
Once you confirm it, let me know.

290
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,180
- We have received another call.
- Okay.

291
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:24,519
- Hello?
- Hello.

292
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:29,519
I'm not entirely sure
since it's only a sketch of his face.

293
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:31,490
But that homeless man...

294
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,460
looks like someone I know.

295
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:37,460
Is that so? Could you elaborate, please?

296
00:17:37,529 --> 00:17:41,130
He looks like the person
who sponsored our orphanage yearly.

297
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,329
He went through a terrible incident
a few years ago and vanished.

298
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,369
He donated his entire fortune.

299
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,069
Do you perhaps have a photo
that you two took together?

300
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:52,880
Yes, I did find a photo
that he took with our children.

301
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:54,140
Please send it over now.

302
00:17:54,579 --> 00:17:56,549
Hello, we just sent it.

303
00:17:56,579 --> 00:17:57,819
Please take a look at it.

304
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,460
We've confirmed his identity.

305
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:14,630
The homeless man
was Chairman Kim Sung Gyu...

306
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:16,470
who had owned
1 of the top 3 logistics company.

307
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,839
After losing his family five years ago,

308
00:18:18,869 --> 00:18:20,569
he had donated his entire fortune
to the society...

309
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,339
and disappeared.

310
00:18:22,369 --> 00:18:25,539
He was known to be generous and giving.

311
00:18:28,849 --> 00:18:29,950
Stop.

312
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,750
Thanks to our viewers,

313
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:37,019
- Send it to me this instant.
- we were able to identify him...

314
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:39,619
when the police had failed to do so.

315
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:43,630
Even the most trivial reports
may help us catch the culprit.

316
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:46,099
(I saw Han Guk with a man just now.
Please call me. 010-3737-258)

317
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,569
Someone has reported seeing Han Guk.

318
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:49,900
I'll put them through right now.

319
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,769
- You spotted the boy?
- Gosh, I finally got through.

320
00:18:53,869 --> 00:18:57,039
How dare you act so rudely
and hang up on me?

321
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:59,210
Why didn't you put me through?

322
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,680
You treat me like I'm drunk
and mentally insane.

323
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:04,380
- Look here.
- Detective Go.

324
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:06,049
Have you finally calmed down?

325
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:07,319
You should know you may be punished...

326
00:19:07,349 --> 00:19:09,349
- for making a prank...
- This is not a prank call.

327
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:11,920
Will I be punished for calling you
to ask a question?

328
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:15,259
The video of the kid you just showed
is fake, right?

329
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:17,390
I'm pretty sure it's fake.

330
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,700
That's ridiculous. It was sent
from the culprit.

331
00:19:20,829 --> 00:19:21,930
I don't believe you.

332
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:25,799
Think about it. Why would the culprit
put a mask on the kid's face...

333
00:19:25,869 --> 00:19:27,170
to cover his face?

334
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:30,369
It's because that kid isn't Han Guk.
Don't you think?

335
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,339
Fine. I'll prove...

336
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:34,779
that the video was sent from the culprit.

337
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:37,250
We just found CCTV footage
of the person...

338
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:39,549
who put the envelope with the video
in a locker at a subway station.

339
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:41,220
Watch this.

340
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:57,470
The culprit made Han Guk put
the envelope with the USB stick...

341
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:01,140
in the locker in order to prevent
his identity from being revealed,

342
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,539
and call a delivery service using
a burner phone to send me this envelope.

343
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,539
Do you still think it's fake? Answer me.

344
00:20:07,779 --> 00:20:09,480
Are you saying that it's not fake?

345
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:12,019
- It's my baby Han Guk.
- Ma'am.

346
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,190
- That's my baby right there.
- Ma'am, please calm down.

347
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:18,190
- Why didn't you say so?
- What are you guys waiting for?

348
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:19,890
- Take her out of there now!
- Why did you lie to me?

349
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,829
- Please calm down, ma'am.
- Ma'am.

350
00:20:22,059 --> 00:20:23,759
Han Guk...

351
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,029
- Ma'am.
- Oh, no.

352
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,759
Play an ad.

353
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:32,440
Please call an ambulance now.

354
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:39,279
I didn't see that coming.
I should've explained to her in advance.

355
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,549
You didn't have a chance to tell her.

356
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:44,210
What's wrong with her?

357
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:45,750
Thank you for your help.
Where's Officer Jung?

358
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:49,619
He's searching around Simjeon Station
with other officers to find a witness.

359
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,819
- Why didn't you join them?
- For the next Alfred Hitchcock,

360
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:53,890
this is a better place to learn
about cases like this.

361
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,559
How could you leave your injured friend
alone out there?

362
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,400
- Hong Ju.
- Hey, Min Jung.

363
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,869
About the victim, Byun Soon Young.

364
00:21:02,069 --> 00:21:05,369
I think we talked on the phone
with her daughter on our show.

365
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,970
A few months ago,

366
00:21:08,069 --> 00:21:10,970
the girl sent us her story
for the segment of our show.

367
00:21:12,509 --> 00:21:15,950
That explains the clock with the logo
of the network on it at her house.

368
00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:17,549
Right. We sent her a clock as a gift.

369
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:20,220
We got such high ratings
thanks to her story that day.

370
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,549
(The video clip was fake?)

371
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:22,990
In five seconds.

372
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:26,359
3, 2, 1. Cue.

373
00:21:26,589 --> 00:21:28,859
We had an unexpected situation.

374
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:32,299
Han Guk's mother became shocked
when she saw him...

375
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:33,730
in the CCTV footage.

376
00:21:34,099 --> 00:21:37,569
- She was taken to a hospital.
- Park Jong Ho.

377
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:40,539
- Park Jong Ho. Park Jong Ho...
- I'm sure that you all must be...

378
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:43,109
- feeling the same way as she does.
- He's a power blogger. Cho Mi Jeong.

379
00:21:43,509 --> 00:21:44,680
- She's a mukbang creator.
- We promise...

380
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:47,410
- that we'll do our best...
- Kim Sung Gyu, a company chairman.

381
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:48,849
to make sure that Han Guk will
return to his mother.

382
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:50,650
- Na Chi Gook. Na Chi Gook.
- In this situation,

383
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,519
- every little piece of information...
- Na Chi Gook.

384
00:21:52,579 --> 00:21:54,420
- from the viewers...
- Na Chi Gook.

385
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,390
- is crucial.
- Na Chi Gook is different.

386
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,789
There's a missing piece here.

387
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,660
We'll read every comment you upload...

388
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:04,460
- very carefully...
- I got it.

389
00:22:04,529 --> 00:22:06,730
- and find Han Guk.
- What the victims all have in common.

390
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:08,170
We promise you.

391
00:22:08,269 --> 00:22:10,730
It's time for Confession Time.

392
00:22:11,099 --> 00:22:12,400
Go ahead and make a confession.

393
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:16,869
Mom, thank you for raising me.

394
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:20,140
I will make a lot of money when I grow up.

395
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,250
I hope you live a long, healthy life.
I love you, Mom.

396
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:29,190
Her story touched
the viewers' hearts that day,

397
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,190
and it was talked about for a while.

398
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:34,930
Park Jong Ho was the power blogger
with the nickname Ant Boy...

399
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:36,190
who got 50,000 visitors.

400
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:39,160
He kept his blog public
so everyone could read his posts.

401
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:41,470
Cho Mi Jeong was a mukbang streamer...

402
00:22:41,529 --> 00:22:43,670
with 30,000 subscribers.

403
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:46,200
Mr. Kim, the homeless man, who turned out
to be Chairman Kim Sung Gyu...

404
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:48,369
donated all of his fortune five years ago,

405
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,640
which drew a lot of attention.

406
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:52,680
- Have you seen this child...
- Officer!

407
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,680
- Yes? What's the matter?
- I need you to come with me.

408
00:22:56,609 --> 00:22:58,380
On top of stealing CCTV footage,

409
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:00,650
now they're trying to
take the lockers apart.

410
00:23:01,019 --> 00:23:02,220
- Who?
- Hurry up.

411
00:23:02,289 --> 00:23:04,549
This is what the victims had in common.

412
00:23:04,619 --> 00:23:07,490
Except for Na Chi Gook, the prison guard.
However, I found out...

413
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:09,359
that Ms. Choi had the key.

414
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:12,500
That's right. I still remember it vividly
since it was my first interview.

415
00:23:12,829 --> 00:23:15,500
A student fell into a critical condition
after a mob violence.

416
00:23:15,569 --> 00:23:19,339
His doctor said that the student would've
died if he had been saved any later.

417
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:22,069
The student was able to survive
thanks to other students...

418
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,670
who saved his life.

419
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:26,539
And this person is one of the students
who saved his life.

420
00:23:28,549 --> 00:23:32,180
I was hesitating because I was scared,
but my friend ran to them to stop them.

421
00:23:34,549 --> 00:23:36,049
That friend of mine is the one
who should be called a hero.

422
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:38,519
I really don't deserve this award.

423
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,559
This is the prison officer Na Chi Gook.

424
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:45,359
I interviewed him eight years ago
when he received the Citizen Hero Award.

425
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:48,230
And this interview was on the news
later in the evening that day.

426
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:49,829
On the national news show.

427
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:52,299
Doctor, please wait.

428
00:23:52,769 --> 00:23:55,740
You know, the person who saved you
when you were in high school...

429
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,710
Hurry up! Help!

430
00:23:59,609 --> 00:24:01,910
That student was Chi Gook.

431
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:04,880
So please save Chi Gook's life in return.

432
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:07,779
Please. I'm begging you. Please save him.

433
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:13,890
If he's Headhunter's son,
that means he was born as a psycho too.

434
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:16,559
Don't you think he should be beheaded too?

435
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:18,759
Look at his eyes.

436
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,569
Those aren't human eyes.
They're the eyes of a monster.

437
00:24:32,809 --> 00:24:33,980
You're right.

438
00:24:35,579 --> 00:24:38,049
The killer's blood runs through my veins.

439
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,250
So don't provoke me.

440
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:43,349
Or else, I'll kill you guys first.

441
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:52,029
Gosh. You punk.

442
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:57,799
Guys, let's be heroes today. Kill him!

443
00:25:00,369 --> 00:25:02,069
Hey, stop it! Over here!

444
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,170
Over here! Help!

445
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:12,680
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

446
00:25:13,619 --> 00:25:15,619
What do we do? I think he's dead.

447
00:25:16,049 --> 00:25:17,089
Ba Reum.

448
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,390
No. He's still breathing.
Call an ambulance.

449
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,059
- Hurry, Chi Gook.
- Okay. Hello?

450
00:25:22,529 --> 00:25:23,559
There's a person...

451
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:25,829
Did you realize it?

452
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:28,099
Intentionally or unintentionally,

453
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,799
the victims' private lives were revealed.

454
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:33,799
Hiding in his room, the culprit
listened to the radio,

455
00:25:33,869 --> 00:25:36,309
searched through blogs,
watched online videos,

456
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:38,109
and explored news...

457
00:25:38,309 --> 00:25:40,210
to choose his targets.

458
00:25:46,619 --> 00:25:49,220
- We'll explain to you.
- Why did you lie to me?

459
00:25:49,349 --> 00:25:51,819
"Why did you lie to me?"
What Han Guk's mother said...

460
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:54,089
- stirred up a debate.
- What's that?

461
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:57,890
We received information that the video
they showed was fake,

462
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,130
and confirmed the fact urgently.

463
00:26:00,329 --> 00:26:03,029
We found some footage of Han Guk...

464
00:26:03,099 --> 00:26:04,799
from "Hope for Children",

465
00:26:04,869 --> 00:26:07,640
a documentary that aired on OBN
one month ago...

466
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:10,539
to compare it to the child in the video
claimed to be sent from the culprit.

467
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:14,509
Dad, I miss you.

468
00:26:16,009 --> 00:26:17,450
- I love you.
- While doing so,

469
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:19,450
we found something surprising.

470
00:26:19,549 --> 00:26:22,190
In the show that aired a month ago,

471
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:24,349
Han Guk had a burn scar...

472
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:27,920
that's about 1cm long on his neck.

473
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:31,759
But the child in the video that they said
was sent from the culprit...

474
00:26:31,829 --> 00:26:34,029
doesn't have the burn scar.

475
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:37,400
That child is not Han Guk.

476
00:26:38,269 --> 00:26:40,470
Then why did the kidnapper
who took Han Guk away...

477
00:26:40,769 --> 00:26:43,309
make a video of another child?

478
00:26:43,539 --> 00:26:47,410
The only possible explanation is
that the video was made by the staff.

479
00:26:47,579 --> 00:26:50,410
We'll give the "Sherlock Hong Ju" team
a chance...

480
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,150
to refute our opinion.

481
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:54,380
What is going on? Choi Hong Ju!

482
00:26:54,619 --> 00:26:56,289
Did you guys make a fake video?

483
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:57,990
Gosh, you punks.

484
00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:01,859
I'll refute what they're saying.
Connect me to them.

485
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,900
Do you want to refute what we said?

486
00:27:08,299 --> 00:27:10,900
The video we revealed really was
sent from the culprit.

487
00:27:11,269 --> 00:27:14,500
But we just proved that the child
in the video is not Han Guk.

488
00:27:14,569 --> 00:27:17,970
You must prove that you didn't edit
the video for your show first.

489
00:27:18,039 --> 00:27:20,079
Are you saying that you did not...

490
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,480
make the video you revealed on that show?

491
00:27:22,549 --> 00:27:25,279
That's correct. I already said
that it was sent from the culprit.

492
00:27:25,349 --> 00:27:27,450
Camera One, get a close-up shot
of Detective Go.

493
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:28,819
I see. All right.

494
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:32,319
We are connected
to a very important person right now.

495
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:34,119
We'll talk to the person. Hello?

496
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,190
The child wearing a mask...

497
00:27:36,259 --> 00:27:38,799
in the video is my son.

498
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:41,869
I got a call from his acting coach,

499
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:43,799
and took him there by myself.

500
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:46,900
I was told that it would be helpful
for finding Han Guk,

501
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:49,769
and agreed not to reveal this
until the show ends.

502
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:53,079
But still, I don't think
this is right, Detective.

503
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,349
I suppose you met Detective Go.
Am I right?

504
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:59,349
Of course, I met him.
The lady on the show was there too.

505
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:03,720
So you're saying
that Director Choi and Detective Go...

506
00:28:03,789 --> 00:28:06,220
asked your child to act in the video.

507
00:28:06,589 --> 00:28:08,759
That's what it means. Thank you.

508
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:12,099
Why on earth did you make a fake video...

509
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,960
and deceive the viewers?

510
00:28:14,029 --> 00:28:15,930
Why did you fake it?

511
00:28:16,369 --> 00:28:17,670
I said we never faked it!

512
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:20,039
Detective Go seems too emotional now.

513
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:22,609
I believe he's not able to speak
to us rationally.

514
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:24,710
- Wait.
- Thank you for your rebuttal.

515
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:26,480
- Darn it.
- Hey, wait.

516
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:28,549
- Don't disconnect it yet.
- Play an ad!

517
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,680
We'll be back after a commercial break.

518
00:28:31,549 --> 00:28:32,750
(Was it fake? "Sherlock Hong Ju" is over.)

519
00:28:32,819 --> 00:28:35,220
(I believe in Detective Go.
He must've had his own reasons.)

520
00:28:35,549 --> 00:28:37,990
I'll send you two videos.

521
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:41,160
The footage from the documentary
and the video we played. Verify them.

522
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,289
See if the same child was in both videos.

523
00:28:42,829 --> 00:28:46,460
That means that this video was not
sent from the culprit.

524
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:48,900
Then what do you think
happened to Han Guk?

525
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:51,269
Experts in kidnapping cases
usually believe...

526
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:54,599
that the kidnapped child is dead
after 48 hours.

527
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:57,109
Put me on the screen
after the commercial break.

528
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,440
In five seconds.

529
00:28:59,009 --> 00:29:02,880
3, 2, 1. Cue.

530
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:06,880
I admit it.

531
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,990
Like the child's father said,
we did make a fake video.

532
00:29:11,019 --> 00:29:12,720
(This is no joke. It's huge fun.)

533
00:29:13,019 --> 00:29:14,119
- What?
- What?

534
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:18,230
Because we were sure the killer
would call when we showed the fake video.

535
00:29:18,259 --> 00:29:19,960
It was a ruse to get the killer involved,

536
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,430
in case things didn't work out.

537
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:24,630
Detective Go Mu Chi
admitted to fixing the show.

538
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:27,339
But we did not play that fake video.

539
00:29:27,369 --> 00:29:28,640
To be exact,

540
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:32,640
before we even played the fake video,
the video from the killer arrived first.

541
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,910
The video we played
was definitely from the killer.

542
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:39,319
They shot a fake video but did not air it?

543
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,150
"I had a drink but did not drive drunk."

544
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:44,589
I get the picture.

545
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,759
We got our hands on more evidence.

546
00:29:46,819 --> 00:29:49,059
Yes, we did. Please watch this first.

547
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:53,200
This is the footage...

548
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:56,130
OBN aired saying it's Han Guk
putting the envelope into the locker.

549
00:29:56,769 --> 00:29:59,740
The security camera footage we just got...

550
00:30:00,099 --> 00:30:02,640
is of the courier collecting the envelope.

551
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:05,039
Han Guk put the envelope...

552
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:06,740
into locker number 14.

553
00:30:06,779 --> 00:30:09,980
But the locker the courier
took the envelope from...

554
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:12,319
is number 13.

555
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,849
Han Guk put the envelope
into locker number 14...

556
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:17,319
at 9:50pm.

557
00:30:17,349 --> 00:30:20,289
The time the courier arrived
and picked up his envelope...

558
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:22,559
is 20 minutes later at 10:10pm.

559
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:26,829
Then do we have the identity
of the person and the time...

560
00:30:26,859 --> 00:30:28,059
they put the envelope in locker 13?

561
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:31,430
As you can see,
10 minutes before Han Guk...

562
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:33,940
approaches the lockers, at 9:40pm,

563
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:35,809
both lockers 13 and 14 are empty.

564
00:30:36,009 --> 00:30:38,640
A short while later, a train arrives
and people mill around.

565
00:30:38,779 --> 00:30:41,740
We can't get a good look at the lockers.

566
00:30:42,349 --> 00:30:44,009
After the crowd clears,

567
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:47,150
the light shows locker 13 is in use.

568
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,450
Then...

569
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:52,819
do we know what was inside the envelope
Han Guk put in locker 14?

570
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:56,490
Unfortunately, the police
prevented us from...

571
00:30:56,529 --> 00:30:57,759
checking the contents.

572
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,500
How come the video
OBN produced was found at,

573
00:31:03,569 --> 00:31:06,440
and the place the killer
made Han Guk leave an envelope at...

574
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:08,299
were both Simjeon Station?

575
00:31:08,339 --> 00:31:10,009
And in neighboring lockers too.

576
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,140
Should we consider that a coincidence?

577
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:16,450
To summarize, the killer
found out OBN filmed a fake video...

578
00:31:16,509 --> 00:31:18,779
- and left it in the locker,
- Right.

579
00:31:18,819 --> 00:31:20,680
then made Han Guk...

580
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,250
leave another envelope
in the locker right next to it.

581
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:27,859
Could we take this to mean...

582
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:31,829
the killer did this to show the video...

583
00:31:31,859 --> 00:31:33,230
OBN aired was a fake?

584
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,569
Statistically, if you rile up a criminal
who took a hostage,

585
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,500
the likelihood of
the hostage's survival is very low.

586
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,769
I pray that Han Guk is still alive.

587
00:31:43,609 --> 00:31:45,240
We'll come back after a commercial break.

588
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,940
(This is not even funny.
Can we save Han Guk?)

589
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:11,099
- Yes, sir.
- The killer made a fake video...

590
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:13,900
- and sent that to us?
- I need to check but I think so.

591
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,910
Why would he do that? What for?

592
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:19,380
Perhaps this was
what he was after all along.

593
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,210
He wanted to stop us from airing.

594
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:24,549
He demanded we do a live show.
Why on earth would he do that?

595
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:27,150
Maybe the show itself
wasn't what he wanted.

596
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,589
He wanted to make things more dramatic...

597
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:33,220
to show that he exists.

598
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,660
If not that...

599
00:32:36,529 --> 00:32:37,660
If not, what?

600
00:32:40,259 --> 00:32:42,670
What if all this was his plan?

601
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:51,470
- Hey.
- Detective Go.

602
00:32:51,809 --> 00:32:55,349
I stopped the reporters from trying to
get into the locker next to number 13,

603
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:56,980
and there's a flash drive in there too.

604
00:32:57,009 --> 00:32:59,019
A flash drive? Check it immediately.

605
00:32:59,779 --> 00:33:00,819
(No access)

606
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:06,759
(No access)

607
00:33:07,289 --> 00:33:09,730
- What?
- I think the file's damaged.

608
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:10,960
Nothing's showing up.

609
00:33:11,059 --> 00:33:12,829
Take it to Mujin Police Station.

610
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:15,259
You're five minutes away by taxi.
Take a taxi and hurry.

611
00:33:17,099 --> 00:33:18,200
Thank you.

612
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:19,400
Pick up quick.

613
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,569
This is crazy.

614
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:22,609
Someone's bringing over another clip.

615
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,940
Restore it as soon as possible.
It must be done fast.

616
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,240
Bye.

617
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,109
Wrap up the show. The boss' orders.

618
00:33:30,809 --> 00:33:33,279
What do you mean?
We still have 15 minutes left!

619
00:33:33,319 --> 00:33:35,119
Everyone's complaining it's rigged.

620
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:36,549
The boss is furious!

621
00:33:36,819 --> 00:33:39,220
Don't complain and close up
after the commercial break.

622
00:33:39,589 --> 00:33:41,789
All cameras but the closing,
back up and shut down.

623
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,099
What are you doing?

624
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:48,430
Don't you want to get paid?

625
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,569
Do as you're told!

626
00:33:51,099 --> 00:33:52,539
Let's wrap up.

627
00:34:01,609 --> 00:34:02,779
Bye.

628
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,250
Can you go any faster?

629
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:17,530
I'll direct the rest.

630
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:19,000
Detective Go will host on his own.

631
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:21,530
Ms. Choi, go downstairs and wrap up.

632
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:22,769
We can't go on like this.

633
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,730
We're almost there. Help me out.

634
00:34:24,769 --> 00:34:27,300
Don't put me on the spot.
We have the boss' orders.

635
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:33,179
Honey. Let's think she's our daughter.

636
00:34:33,579 --> 00:34:36,110
Let's push on for our daughter's sake.

637
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,119
Oh, whatever.

638
00:34:42,449 --> 00:34:44,489
You support me if I get fired.

639
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:46,360
Thank you, Ms. Oh.

640
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:47,489
Thank you, director.

641
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:53,699
- What?
- We're restoring the video.

642
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,630
Okay. Do it as soon as possible.

643
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,469
I sent two comparison videos of Han Guk.

644
00:34:58,530 --> 00:34:59,739
Ask about those.

645
00:35:00,769 --> 00:35:02,670
What happened to
Han Guk's comparison videos?

646
00:35:02,869 --> 00:35:04,070
Oh, those?

647
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:05,710
We just finished comparing them.

648
00:35:05,739 --> 00:35:08,010
Hey! Open the door!

649
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:11,480
Open this door!

650
00:35:12,219 --> 00:35:14,650
Five seconds until we go live.
Focus, Go Mu Chi.

651
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:21,619
(Sherlock Hong Ju)

652
00:35:29,769 --> 00:35:31,199
We checked and...

653
00:35:32,739 --> 00:35:34,800
the boy in the video we aired...

654
00:35:35,369 --> 00:35:37,309
was not Han Guk.

655
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:44,010
But the video we aired
was definitely from the killer.

656
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,820
(Are you wasting taxpayers' money?)

657
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,179
(No wonder you're stalling!)

658
00:35:48,219 --> 00:35:50,190
(You lied about knowing the answer!)

659
00:35:50,219 --> 00:35:51,690
(Stop lying to the public
and shut it down.)

660
00:36:00,329 --> 00:36:01,400
Oh?

661
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:05,170
The reason the killer made a fake video...

662
00:36:05,539 --> 00:36:06,800
and made us air it...

663
00:36:07,139 --> 00:36:10,610
is probably a trap set
so he can watch us...

664
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:11,909
give up.

665
00:36:13,139 --> 00:36:14,280
Open the door quickly.

666
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:18,010
But I'll never give up.

667
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:20,780
I will stay on air until our time is up,

668
00:36:21,019 --> 00:36:22,250
and I'll save Han Guk.

669
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:24,320
Enlarge this part here.

670
00:36:27,289 --> 00:36:28,360
Do you see that?

671
00:36:28,389 --> 00:36:29,789
Stop this already and reveal yourself.

672
00:36:31,329 --> 00:36:34,530
If you're confident,
stop faking it and show up.

673
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:39,639
You have my number.

674
00:36:41,739 --> 00:36:43,070
Call me right now.

675
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:45,510
(Stop mocking us and stop the show now.)

676
00:36:45,539 --> 00:36:47,610
(Thanks for the rigged live show.)

677
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:56,489
(Officer Jung Ba Reum)

678
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,420
- I got it.
- Open it.

679
00:37:04,489 --> 00:37:06,230
- What are you doing?
- Sir.

680
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,260
- Are you trying to get fired?
- We're almost there.

681
00:37:08,329 --> 00:37:09,400
Drag them all out!

682
00:37:09,429 --> 00:37:11,170
- Take them out!
- Wait!

683
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,400
Sir!

684
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:22,650
I will kill the kid when the show ends.

685
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:29,750
(10:50pm, 10 minutes until the show ends)

686
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:36,289
Everyone.

687
00:37:37,329 --> 00:37:38,730
What does this look like?

688
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:42,570
It's too decomposed to be sure,

689
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:44,829
but it looks like an insect.

690
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,409
On the line is entomologist
Doctor Lee Pil Seong.

691
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:52,070
Doctor. What is this?

692
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:54,079
Take a close look.

693
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,110
Is it a locust?

694
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:59,579
Locusts have long wings
that reach beyond their abdomen.

695
00:37:59,619 --> 00:38:00,849
Then is it a bush cricket?

696
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:03,750
Bush crickets
have wings around that length,

697
00:38:03,789 --> 00:38:05,550
and bumps on their thorax.

698
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:07,789
That does not have any bumps.

699
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:08,889
Then is it...

700
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,030
a katydid?

701
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:15,829
I see the thorn.

702
00:38:15,929 --> 00:38:18,170
The border is a light brown color.

703
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:20,170
It's a Psyrana Japonica.

704
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,400
Thanks for your help.

705
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:25,340
Ladies and gentlemen. This is a katydid.

706
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,340
It was found in Park Jong Ho's throat.

707
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:30,909
The killer stuffed it down there
after killing him.

708
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:34,250
What comes to mind
when you think of a katydid?

709
00:38:35,849 --> 00:38:38,789
The fable about the
"The Ant and the Grasshopper".

710
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:42,429
All five deaths...

711
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:48,630
involve a child's story.

712
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:54,099
Detective, something's reflected in
the eye of the mask.

713
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,940
It's a wall.

714
00:38:55,969 --> 00:38:59,039
I see photos and newspaper cutouts...

715
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:00,210
but it's not clear.

716
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:02,849
There's a drawing too. Is it a cartoon?

717
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:05,079
Oh, it's not a cartoon.

718
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:06,949
I'll send you an enlarged clip.

719
00:39:15,659 --> 00:39:16,929
What is that?

720
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,340
Hold on.

721
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:35,880
Let's see.

722
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:40,349
Hello, sir.  Was Ms. Byun wearing a hat...

723
00:39:40,519 --> 00:39:41,619
when she had clocked out?

724
00:39:43,449 --> 00:39:44,650
She was?

725
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:49,289
What color was it?

726
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:54,429
Are you sure?

727
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,099
I got it.

728
00:40:01,469 --> 00:40:03,510
I finally know why Na Chi Gook
was stripped.

729
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:07,710
Ms. Byun was wearing a purple hat.

730
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:11,409
But when we had found her body,
she was wearing a red hat.

731
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,579
Unlike the other victims,

732
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:15,380
Mr. Na was found stripped.

733
00:40:15,449 --> 00:40:17,849
Up until now, I was certain that
it was because...

734
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,219
his clothes had traces
of the killer's DNA.

735
00:40:20,289 --> 00:40:23,429
However, that was never the case.

736
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:28,230
There's more.
At Chairman Kim's crime scene,

737
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:31,130
we found a hand axe
which was the murder weapon.

738
00:40:31,329 --> 00:40:33,940
The killer moved Ms. Cho's body10 km...

739
00:40:34,039 --> 00:40:37,670
and placed her in a vineyard greenhouse.

740
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:38,969
Why?

741
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,880
Listen carefully.
You're watching this, aren't you?

742
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:47,150
I'm about to tell you
why you chose them as your victims.

743
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:50,050
Byun Soon Young, "Little Red Riding Hood".

744
00:40:50,619 --> 00:40:52,820
Park Jong Ho,
"The Ant and the Grasshopper".

745
00:40:52,989 --> 00:40:55,219
Na Chi Gook, "The Emperor's New Clothes".

746
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,460
Kim Sung Gyu, "The Honest Woodcutter".

747
00:40:57,530 --> 00:40:59,360
Cho Mi Jeong, "The Fox and the Grapes".

748
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,159
You murdered these people...

749
00:41:02,199 --> 00:41:04,030
and dressed them
according to these fairy tales.

750
00:41:12,039 --> 00:41:13,110
(Restricted Number)

751
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:17,679
(Restricted Number)

752
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,519
- Bingo.
- We got a call.

753
00:41:22,019 --> 00:41:23,849
- Trace it.
- Yes, sir.

754
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:27,619
You're smarter than I thought.
I'm impressed.

755
00:41:28,059 --> 00:41:29,489
I'm glad you called,

756
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:31,559
but you should've called sooner.

757
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:33,460
It wasn't fun to blabber by myself.

758
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:35,030
I was quite frustrated,

759
00:41:35,099 --> 00:41:37,570
but I'm happy
that you're getting closer to the answer.

760
00:41:37,929 --> 00:41:39,570
I thought I should give you a compliment.

761
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,539
I thought you had no idea
and were just putting on a show.

762
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:45,539
Ms. Choi.

763
00:41:45,909 --> 00:41:48,780
You should've revealed the answer
had you already known what it was.

764
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:50,710
Tell me if Han Guk is safe or not.

765
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:52,449
He's doing great.

766
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:56,019
All right, then.  Let's hear your answer.

767
00:41:58,489 --> 00:42:02,320
I found something surprising
at the end of these fairy tales.

768
00:42:02,389 --> 00:42:04,389
They all had a moral at the end.

769
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:08,000
"The Ant and the Grasshopper"
is about the grasshopper's laziness.

770
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:12,869
"The Honest Woodcutter"
is about the woodcutter's greediness.

771
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:15,699
"The Fox and the Grapes"
is about the fox's gluttony.

772
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:17,909
All right. And "Little Red Riding Hood"?

773
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:20,239
It's about the wolf's filthy desire.

774
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,909
Sexual desire.

775
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:24,150
Then "The Emperor's New Clothes"?

776
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:27,519
The power-drunk emperor
wasn't aware that he was naked,

777
00:42:27,579 --> 00:42:29,150
and the book ridiculed his haughtiness.

778
00:42:29,219 --> 00:42:31,590
How interesting. So what's the conclusion?

779
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,389
"Little Red Riding Hood", lust.
"The Ant and the Grasshopper", sloth.

780
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:39,860
"The Emperor's New Clothes", pride.
"The Honest Woodcutter", greed.

781
00:42:39,929 --> 00:42:41,630
"The Fox and the Grapes", gluttony.

782
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:46,900
They're 5 of the 7 deadly sins
in Dante's "Inferno".

783
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,039
I've tracked his signal, sir.

784
00:42:50,369 --> 00:42:52,239
That's not bad.

785
00:42:52,809 --> 00:42:55,440
However, did my victims...

786
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:58,079
commit those sins? They didn't.

787
00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:00,119
So why did I kill them?

788
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:02,719
That's because you're...

789
00:43:02,849 --> 00:43:04,889
We got his signal.
You need to buy more time.

790
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,429
You do know...

791
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:13,000
that my parents were killed
by the Headhunter, right?

792
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:17,530
That's why I know very well
about psychopaths.

793
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,699
I studied quite a bit about them.

794
00:43:21,639 --> 00:43:23,440
They're extremely meticulous.

795
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:26,409
However, you were unlike them.

796
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:29,139
You left traces everywhere.

797
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,110
Guess where you left some.

798
00:43:32,409 --> 00:43:33,820
I'll give you a hint.

799
00:43:34,949 --> 00:43:36,489
It happened about two weeks ago.

800
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:39,090
Detective Go.

801
00:43:39,389 --> 00:43:42,989
Are you trying to buy time
so that you can track me?

802
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:46,630
Or are you just rambling
because you don't know the answer?

803
00:43:46,929 --> 00:43:48,659
The deadline is just around the corner.

804
00:43:48,929 --> 00:43:50,329
You better hurry
if you want to save the boy.

805
00:43:52,269 --> 00:43:54,500
I'm not done talking, you scumbag!

806
00:43:54,699 --> 00:43:55,840
We lost him.

807
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:01,440
Judging by how you hung up on me,
you must be anxious.

808
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:04,179
That's right. It's the woman
who just crossed your mind.

809
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:06,420
The very woman you let go of
about two weeks ago.

810
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:10,489
I got it. I finally know why Na Chi Gook
was stripped.

811
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:14,159
You should take this. It seems important.

812
00:44:16,889 --> 00:44:18,429
Hello? What is this about?

813
00:44:19,059 --> 00:44:20,559
I'm not entirely sure,

814
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:23,800
but I think it's him.

815
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:26,840
"Him"? Do you mean the killer?

816
00:44:27,369 --> 00:44:30,039
I used to part-time at a mart.

817
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:32,440
It happened about two weeks ago.

818
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:35,280
I was working late by myself.

819
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:42,989
Then suddenly, someone held...

820
00:44:43,719 --> 00:44:45,389
- a knife to my throat...
- Please spare me.

821
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:47,719
and told me to eat all the food.

822
00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:51,289
If not, he said I'd die.

823
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,699
So I stuffed my face...

824
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:57,599
and kept swallowing the food.

825
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:01,639
And then,

826
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:04,969
I glanced behind me.

827
00:45:05,639 --> 00:45:07,110
There was no one.

828
00:45:07,179 --> 00:45:08,780
Why didn't you report this sooner?

829
00:45:09,079 --> 00:45:10,380
I was afraid.

830
00:45:15,219 --> 00:45:16,320
How much do you weigh?

831
00:45:17,719 --> 00:45:20,389
38kg.

832
00:45:21,019 --> 00:45:23,329
Do you have social media?

833
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:25,489
No, I don't.

834
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:31,269
Were you ever on TV?
Did you do anything in public?

835
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:34,369
I'm an aspiring model,

836
00:45:34,639 --> 00:45:37,070
so I appeared in fashion magazines
a couple of times.

837
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:39,309
Magazines?

838
00:45:48,349 --> 00:45:51,449
Hey, Mr. Park. What did you find...

839
00:45:51,719 --> 00:45:53,190
in Cho Mi Jeong's stomach again?

840
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:54,619
Hold on.

841
00:45:54,989 --> 00:45:56,590
It was empty.

842
00:45:56,789 --> 00:45:59,530
She had traces of food in her esophagus.

843
00:45:59,829 --> 00:46:01,000
In her esophagus?

844
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:06,000
He killed her
because she had failed to swallow.

845
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:07,900
She had thrown up.

846
00:46:07,969 --> 00:46:10,369
We found this medicine
in Ms. Cho's drawer.

847
00:46:11,570 --> 00:46:13,340
This is something anorexics take.

848
00:46:13,639 --> 00:46:16,679
5 packages of ramyeon,
1 iron plate of tteokbokki,

849
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:18,050
and 2 chickens.

850
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:19,619
Goodbye.

851
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:25,289
She filmed mukbang videos to make money.

852
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:29,019
However, she'd vomit every time
because she was afraid of gaining weight.

853
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:31,460
She was suffering from anorexia.

854
00:46:31,530 --> 00:46:33,599
Gluttony? She had none.

855
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:36,769
That was your reason.

856
00:46:37,829 --> 00:46:39,429
You asked me why you killed them.

857
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:44,010
I don't know why, but you have
strong hatred toward the deity.

858
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:47,380
You murdered and made them
give the finger to the cross.

859
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,909
You? You chose...

860
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:53,019
to go against the deity.

861
00:46:53,349 --> 00:46:56,789
To you, those who didn't commit
those seven sins were sinners.

862
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:59,150
Those with no lust, sloth,

863
00:46:59,219 --> 00:47:01,320
pride, greed,

864
00:47:01,389 --> 00:47:03,590
gluttony, envy,

865
00:47:03,659 --> 00:47:04,860
or wrath!

866
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:07,360
Those are the seven sins to you!

867
00:47:07,429 --> 00:47:10,230
And that's why you punished them
as you pleased!

868
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:20,809
Someone's calling you.

869
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:25,550
- You better not hang up on me again.
- Bingo.

870
00:47:26,519 --> 00:47:28,480
You are indeed smart.

871
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:30,889
This is exactly why I'm your fan.

872
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:34,389
Buy some time.
Buy as much time as you can, okay?

873
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:37,260
Byun Soon Young. You killed her
for not being swayed by temptation...

874
00:47:37,329 --> 00:47:39,489
and for diligently raising her daughter.

875
00:47:40,059 --> 00:47:41,360
You blamed her for having no lust.

876
00:47:41,530 --> 00:47:42,659
What a foolish woman.

877
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:46,269
She was good-looking. What was the harm
in being a bit promiscuous?

878
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:48,739
You killed Park Jong Ho
for being hardworking...

879
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:51,570
and shoved a grasshopper down his throat!

880
00:47:51,909 --> 00:47:55,079
Had he been slightly lazier,
he wouldn't have died.

881
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:56,949
What's the point of him working so hard?

882
00:47:57,250 --> 00:48:00,019
He was a weak, little ant
that I could easily step on and kill.

883
00:48:00,679 --> 00:48:02,920
But he squirmed
until he took his last breath.

884
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:04,690
It was very enjoyable.

885
00:48:05,150 --> 00:48:07,260
- What did you just say?
- Don't get all worked up.

886
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:09,219
Just buy some more time. A bit more.

887
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:13,099
Why did you kill Cho Mi Jeong?

888
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:15,860
She'd stuff her face and vomit everything
once the camera was turned off.

889
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:18,570
She'd pretend as if
she just didn't gain any weight.

890
00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:20,639
As for Na Chi Gook...

891
00:48:20,969 --> 00:48:23,840
The moment I watched him
speak so humbly during an interview,

892
00:48:24,539 --> 00:48:27,739
I decided to quickly kill him off
and take his sin away.

893
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:33,050
Then... Then what about that poor grandma?

894
00:48:35,179 --> 00:48:36,650
Why did you kill her?

895
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:39,050
Why did you do it, you scumbag?

896
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:42,619
Oh, her? She was just unlucky.

897
00:48:42,989 --> 00:48:45,829
Do you think I had fun
killing that old granny?

898
00:48:45,929 --> 00:48:49,300
It's more fun when they put up a fight
and refuse to die.

899
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:50,829
She was boring.

900
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:54,570
How dare you say that?

901
00:48:55,269 --> 00:48:57,170
Have you ever thought
in her family's shoes?

902
00:48:58,570 --> 00:49:00,480
Are you even human?

903
00:49:02,809 --> 00:49:04,010
We've tracked him!

904
00:49:04,110 --> 00:49:06,010
Good work. Let's go right now!

905
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:06,880
They've tracked him.

906
00:49:07,179 --> 00:49:09,750
Stall him just a little longer.

907
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:13,159
He stopped at 123 Seongho-dong.

908
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:15,460
Thank goodness. We made it.

909
00:49:17,489 --> 00:49:19,829
That doesn't answer my question.

910
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,260
Time is almost up.

911
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:22,699
Why will this child die?

912
00:49:26,969 --> 00:49:29,670
We found this piece of bread
where Han Guk went missing.

913
00:49:32,769 --> 00:49:34,980
I'm sure you lured him with this bread.

914
00:49:35,239 --> 00:49:37,579
But Han Guk could not make it back home...

915
00:49:37,610 --> 00:49:40,050
when no birds ate the bread.

916
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:42,280
"Birds" Impressive.

917
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:46,519
Yes. You must've applied the sin you chose
to the ending of "Hansel and Gretel".

918
00:49:47,090 --> 00:49:48,590
So what is this child's sin?

919
00:49:49,289 --> 00:49:51,389
We're almost there.
We're surrounding the place.

920
00:49:52,159 --> 00:49:54,130
There are only 2 sins left
out of the 7 deadly sins.

921
00:49:54,159 --> 00:49:56,059
Envy and wrath.

922
00:49:56,099 --> 00:49:57,230
Play the video.

923
00:49:58,199 --> 00:50:01,300
Do you not hate your father
for abandoning you?

924
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,610
No, I don't hate him.

925
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:06,980
I'm sure he had his own reasons.

926
00:50:07,139 --> 00:50:09,750
Your father might be watching this,

927
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:11,809
so you can say whatever
you want to say to him.

928
00:50:12,179 --> 00:50:15,420
Dad, I miss you.

929
00:50:16,849 --> 00:50:17,949
I love you.

930
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:20,190
You watched this.

931
00:50:20,219 --> 00:50:21,320
So?

932
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:23,329
The ending of "Hansel and Gretel".

933
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:27,300
They kill the witch who ate children
by putting her in the cauldron.

934
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:29,059
With rage.

935
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:30,300
They are furious.

936
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:33,239
You wanted Han Guk to be mad
at his father for abandoning him.

937
00:50:33,269 --> 00:50:34,570
You wanted to see rage.

938
00:50:34,699 --> 00:50:35,800
We're here.

939
00:50:36,099 --> 00:50:37,969
You're trying to kill...

940
00:50:38,809 --> 00:50:41,010
an innocent child for a ridiculous reason.

941
00:50:43,650 --> 00:50:46,519
All Right. I got the correct answer.

942
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:49,550
So stop this madness and let the child go.

943
00:50:57,130 --> 00:50:58,260
The culprit is in there.

944
00:50:58,289 --> 00:51:00,929
We confirmed that he's on the phone
while watching TV.

945
00:51:01,030 --> 00:51:03,469
Keep him focused on you.

946
00:51:03,570 --> 00:51:05,469
You think you're some kind of deity,
don't you?

947
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:06,840
Good. Keep stalling him.

948
00:51:07,099 --> 00:51:10,340
You considered people who had never
committed deadly sins as sinners,

949
00:51:10,409 --> 00:51:11,809
and executed them...

950
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:15,340
with a delusion that you are a deity.

951
00:51:16,579 --> 00:51:17,710
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

952
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:21,079
You're not even human.

953
00:51:21,179 --> 00:51:23,590
You are just a disgusting monster.

954
00:51:24,389 --> 00:51:26,349
Just a monster who can never
achieve salvation.

955
00:51:27,219 --> 00:51:28,889
You're worse than scum.

956
00:51:29,719 --> 00:51:31,329
I pity you.

957
00:51:39,329 --> 00:51:40,769
Was it done by Headhunter too?

958
00:51:41,199 --> 00:51:42,800
Is the head cut off this time too?

959
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:47,510
The police haven't been able to catch
Headhunter in the past year,

960
00:51:47,539 --> 00:51:48,980
and many people
deeply distrust the police.

961
00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:50,449
Why do you think you can't catch him?

962
00:51:50,550 --> 00:51:53,079
Is the killer that superb?

963
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:56,079
"Superb"?

964
00:51:56,690 --> 00:51:58,090
You call that scum "superb"?

965
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:01,360
That scum is a mutant and a monster...

966
00:52:01,389 --> 00:52:03,460
who should never have been born.

967
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:06,530
He's worse than scum.

968
00:52:40,159 --> 00:52:41,159
Hyeon Seok.

969
00:52:41,699 --> 00:52:42,860
Hyeon Soo.

970
00:52:44,969 --> 00:52:46,030
There.

971
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:49,300
I've given you what you demanded
for the child's life.

972
00:52:50,469 --> 00:52:51,610
Keep your promise.

973
00:52:51,639 --> 00:52:53,639
The child is in there. Be careful.

974
00:52:53,679 --> 00:52:55,380
Make sure the child is safe.

975
00:52:55,409 --> 00:52:56,679
And catch the culprit alive.

976
00:53:03,619 --> 00:53:04,750
Don't move!

977
00:53:04,789 --> 00:53:05,989
Don't move! Get down!

978
00:53:06,019 --> 00:53:07,289
- Stay still!
- Don't move!

979
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:10,159
We caught him.

980
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:12,860
You're done for, you scum.

981
00:53:14,030 --> 00:53:16,599
You think? You're wrong.

982
00:53:18,469 --> 00:53:19,599
Why?

983
00:53:24,539 --> 00:53:27,739
Honey, what's wrong? What's going on?

984
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:30,110
- What's going on?
- Why are you doing this?

985
00:53:33,579 --> 00:53:35,320
You're running out of time.

986
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:37,449
Hurry up if you want to save the child.

987
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:49,760
- Detective Go, stay calm.
- It's "wrath".

988
00:53:50,199 --> 00:53:52,199
I got it right. Where's the kid?

989
00:53:57,469 --> 00:54:00,179
The video in the USB stick
found in the locker has been restored.

990
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,449
Where is the kid, you scum?

991
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:04,980
Reveal yourself right now.

992
00:54:19,559 --> 00:54:21,400
Hello? Hello?

993
00:54:21,559 --> 00:54:22,659
Put that on the screen.

994
00:54:23,769 --> 00:54:25,000
Now!

995
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:27,900
Have you lost your mind? No!

996
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:30,170
Put it on the screen now
if you want to keep your job!

997
00:54:30,469 --> 00:54:31,840
You crazy...

998
00:54:31,869 --> 00:54:33,070
- Hold her.
- Sir.

999
00:54:33,170 --> 00:54:34,309
Take her out of here!

1000
00:54:36,010 --> 00:54:37,880
Let go of me. Let go! I said, let go!

1001
00:54:37,949 --> 00:54:39,050
Where's the kid?

1002
00:54:39,179 --> 00:54:40,250
Look.

1003
00:54:46,190 --> 00:54:48,519
He's the one who didn't commit wrath,
not Han Guk.

1004
00:54:50,159 --> 00:54:52,690
He's a sinner who didn't feel the wrath.

1005
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:55,400
Mu Won.

1006
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,800
- Turn it off right now, you crazy fool!
- A close-up shot of Detective Go.

1007
00:55:04,369 --> 00:55:05,969
Father... Father Go.

1008
00:55:08,210 --> 00:55:11,380
I said I would kill him when the show
ended unless you figured out the answer.

1009
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:13,920
Time's up.

1010
00:55:20,059 --> 00:55:21,760
- Mu Won.
- Does it make sense?

1011
00:55:22,489 --> 00:55:25,659
I mean, Headhunter killed his parents
by cutting off their heads,

1012
00:55:26,090 --> 00:55:28,500
and made him disabled.

1013
00:55:29,130 --> 00:55:30,400
But he forgave Headhunter.

1014
00:55:31,199 --> 00:55:32,670
It was disgusting.

1015
00:55:33,199 --> 00:55:36,769
It was natural for me
to have a heart full of rage.

1016
00:55:37,010 --> 00:55:40,110
But I'm sure that rage
gave me the strength to go on...

1017
00:55:40,139 --> 00:55:42,079
and helped me survive.

1018
00:55:42,539 --> 00:55:46,010
However, once I decided to forgive him,

1019
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:48,050
everything changed.

1020
00:55:48,719 --> 00:55:52,750
I told myself to live each day harder
for my little brother.

1021
00:55:53,349 --> 00:55:57,030
On the day when I told Han Seo Joon
that I forgave him,

1022
00:55:57,659 --> 00:55:59,389
I slept like a rock.

1023
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:01,860
It was the first day...

1024
00:56:03,329 --> 00:56:04,900
I had slept peacefully since that day.

1025
00:56:05,230 --> 00:56:06,670
Mu Won!

1026
00:56:06,769 --> 00:56:08,300
You scum!

1027
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:10,440
I will kill you if you hurt my brother!

1028
00:56:10,469 --> 00:56:13,440
- You scum!
- Why is wrath a sin?

1029
00:56:13,909 --> 00:56:15,739
Not feeling wrath is a sin.

1030
00:56:16,579 --> 00:56:18,510
It's not too late for you
to get angry at him.

1031
00:56:18,710 --> 00:56:20,010
Unleash your anger.

1032
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:22,579
If you do that, I'll forgive your sin.

1033
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:26,119
Go on. Unleash your anger.

1034
00:56:27,519 --> 00:56:28,659
Come on.

1035
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,329
Mu Won, go ahead.

1036
00:56:32,730 --> 00:56:35,460
Get angry at that scum. Please.

1037
00:56:37,929 --> 00:56:39,630
That scum killed our parents.

1038
00:56:40,199 --> 00:56:43,639
You want to kill that jerk
Han Seo Joon too. Please.

1039
00:56:44,670 --> 00:56:45,840
Mu Chi.

1040
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:51,110
Then get angry at me instead.

1041
00:56:52,210 --> 00:56:53,349
Get angry at me.

1042
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:54,820
It's my fault.

1043
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:58,090
You wouldn't have been caught...

1044
00:56:58,349 --> 00:57:00,889
if I hadn't made a noise
while we were hiding in the camper.

1045
00:57:01,659 --> 00:57:03,420
When that scum was beating you up,

1046
00:57:03,559 --> 00:57:05,429
I just stood there watching it.

1047
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:08,730
Mu Won, I'm the one who made you disabled.

1048
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:11,500
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

1049
00:57:12,170 --> 00:57:14,340
You forgave that jerk because of me.

1050
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:16,539
So please get angry at me.

1051
00:57:16,639 --> 00:57:18,570
I'm begging you. Please.

1052
00:57:19,309 --> 00:57:22,340
Mu Chi, I have never...

1053
00:57:22,809 --> 00:57:24,650
resented you.

1054
00:57:25,010 --> 00:57:28,050
No. Don't say that. Resent me.

1055
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:30,489
Please resent me.

1056
00:57:30,789 --> 00:57:33,190
I don't want to see you hurt yourself...

1057
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:36,360
and destroy your own life...

1058
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:38,789
for your revenge.

1059
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:48,539
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1060
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:50,940
Please let my brother go.

1061
00:57:51,309 --> 00:57:52,840
Please forgive me.

1062
00:57:53,139 --> 00:57:54,380
Oh, no.

1063
00:57:55,639 --> 00:57:56,880
- Gosh. What's going on?
- He might be killed.

1064
00:57:57,650 --> 00:57:58,880
- That's horrible.
- I'm terrified.

1065
00:57:58,909 --> 00:58:00,420
I was wrong.

1066
00:58:00,449 --> 00:58:03,349
I shouldn't have acted up.
Please forgive me.

1067
00:58:03,519 --> 00:58:04,719
I'm sorry.

1068
00:58:05,019 --> 00:58:06,250
Yes. I see. Thank you.

1069
00:58:06,289 --> 00:58:06,960
Thank you.

1070
00:58:09,019 --> 00:58:10,159
Taxi.

1071
00:58:12,190 --> 00:58:15,360
Take me to Yirye-dong Church, quick.

1072
00:58:24,239 --> 00:58:26,769
Kill me. Kill me.

1073
00:58:27,210 --> 00:58:28,710
I will die instead!

1074
00:58:29,039 --> 00:58:30,409
I will die instead.

1075
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,809
Let my poor brother go.

1076
00:58:33,079 --> 00:58:35,219
Get my brother go.

1077
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:38,190
Mu Chi. I'm okay.

1078
00:58:38,590 --> 00:58:42,159
Whatever happens to me,
it's not your fault.

1079
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:44,659
- Okay?
- It's your last chance.

1080
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:47,530
Be angry. Show fury.

1081
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:50,000
To the Headhunter who killed your parents.

1082
00:58:50,059 --> 00:58:52,170
To the world who let him live.

1083
00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:54,269
Let your anger explode.

1084
00:58:54,539 --> 00:58:56,639
Please. Mu Won.

1085
00:59:02,179 --> 00:59:04,179
My dear brother.

1086
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:07,250
I am...

1087
00:59:10,489 --> 00:59:12,119
so sorry.

1088
00:59:12,789 --> 00:59:15,559
Please, Mu Won. Mu Won.

1089
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:18,989
I'm sorry.

1090
00:59:23,429 --> 00:59:27,099
No! No!

1091
01:00:51,889 --> 01:00:53,860
Do you think you're a deity?

1092
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:58,760
I've seen someone like you.

1093
01:01:01,429 --> 01:01:04,530
You considered sinners as people
who didn't commit the seven sins,

1094
01:01:04,599 --> 01:01:06,369
and punished them yourself.

1095
01:01:06,699 --> 01:01:09,840
You thought that you were a deity.

1096
01:01:21,550 --> 01:01:22,820
Too bad, though.

1097
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:25,349
You're not even human.

1098
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:31,059
You are just a disgusting monster.

1099
01:01:37,730 --> 01:01:39,969
Just a monster who can never
achieve salvation.

1100
01:01:47,639 --> 01:01:52,210
(I am the deity.)

1101
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:59,289
(I am the deity.)

1102
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:39,960
(Mouse)

1103
01:02:40,030 --> 01:02:42,130
He knew we were making a fake video...

1104
01:02:42,599 --> 01:02:44,329
and made one too.

1105
01:02:44,829 --> 01:02:46,030
How did he know?

1106
01:02:46,199 --> 01:02:48,139
Is he listening in on us?

1107
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:51,670
The last person Kim Joon Sung called
before he died, was you.

1108
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:53,010
Are you okay?

1109
01:02:53,739 --> 01:02:56,880
The day Officer Na was hurt,
someone was here, right?

1110
01:02:57,579 --> 01:02:58,650
Who?

1111
01:02:58,710 --> 01:03:00,849
Him. Was he caught?

1112
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:02,650
Did you see his face?

1113
01:03:02,949 --> 01:03:06,349
Bong Yi's grandmother's DNA
was found in the doctor's house?
