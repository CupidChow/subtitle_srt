Grandma,

89
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,319
I'm back.

90
00:03:58,479 --> 00:03:59,719
I heard you're sick.

91
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,159
Are you feeling better?

92
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:03,759
If I don't get sick,
you'll never come back, right?

93
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:06,680
For no reason at all,
you're not doing your job.

94
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,359
You've come back after a long time,

95
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:08,758
and you're not going

96
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:10,800
to take over our family's business.

97
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,840
You always wander around all day
without purpose.

98
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,040
Do you want to piss me off?

99
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,159
My goodness,

100
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:17,759
Grandma.

101
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:20,399
Don't be angry.

102
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,160
I'm back, aren't I?

103
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:24,040
Here,

104
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:26,000
have some tea

105
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,160
and calm down.

106
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:30,079
It's hot, be careful.

107
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,119
I've arranged for Mr. Du from LK Company

108
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,958
and his daughter, Du Anqi,

109
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:43,319
to come over for dinner tomorrow.

110
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,639
I heard that Ms. Du
has just returned from France

111
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:51,319
with a double master's degree
in economics and art.

112
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:55,040
I think she's more than qualified

113
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:56,879
to be your wife.

114
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:57,800
What?

115
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,160
You mean

116
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,560
you're going to set me up
on a blind date again?

117
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,130
(Screen projection cover)

118
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,879
That's my design proposal.

119
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:25,799
Simply put, traditions

120
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,999
need to be passed on

121
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,800
as well as innovated.

122
00:05:28,049 --> 00:05:30,328
Only a perfect blend of the two

123
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:32,000
can lead to new fashions.

124
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,920
Long Mengli's proposal is brilliant.

125
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:40,879
Next, Lin Miaomiao.

126
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:42,839
Director Qian,

127
00:05:43,765 --> 00:05:44,845
judges,

128
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,480
I'm sorry

129
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:48,160
that I can't participate
in the competition

130
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,079
because my design

131
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,680
has been plagiarized

132
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,160
by Ms. Long Mengli.

133
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,079
Lin Miaomiao,

134
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,959
do you have any evidence to prove

135
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:05,359
that Long Mengli plagiarized?

136
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,399
Of course, I do.

137
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,399
This is the draft of my design,

138
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,800
it's 80% similar

139
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,399
to the one Long Mengli just presented.

140
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:18,439
What's this if it's not a plagiarism?

141
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:20,920
Long Mengli,

142
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,399
what's going on?

143
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:26,839
This

144
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,759
is a premeditated frame-up.

145
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,198
Hey, what's going on?

146
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:33,599
You're the one who plagiarized,

147
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,480
so don't quibble.

148
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,680
Lin Miaomiao.

149
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,279
First,

150
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,198
my proposal is saved
on the company's computer.

151
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,000
That's what everyone knows.

152
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,079
I'm sure

153
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:43,518
there must be some kind of technique

154
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:44,879
that can open my computer.

155
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,800
So we don't know who plagiarized yet.

156
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:49,120
Second,

157
00:06:50,002 --> 00:06:51,559
everyone knows Lin Miaomiao

158
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,078
is my main rival.

159
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,278
Why would I take the risk

160
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:55,719
of ruining my career

161
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,719
when I know

162
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,959
I would be exposed right away?

163
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,319
Would I be that dumb?

164
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:01,758
I don't know

165
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:02,480
what you think.

166
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,439
Maybe you're just trying
to make a counter-argument

167
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:07,439
so you can clear your name.

168
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,159
That's a stupid way

169
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,079
to frame me.

170
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,199
Stop accusing me.

171
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:21,040
Enough.

172
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:23,920
This isn't the place for you to argue.

173
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,439
Long Mengli.

174
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,519
What you're saying may sound reasonable,

175
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,199
but it's all one-sided.

176
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,199
Unless you can find the proof,

177
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:32,399
we will not

00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:33,719

179
