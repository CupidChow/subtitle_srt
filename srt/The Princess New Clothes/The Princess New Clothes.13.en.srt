11
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,220
Hello, Bai Yu.

12
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:57,140
Mengli.

13
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:58,580
Are you still in the office?

14
00:00:58,980 --> 00:00:59,980
I'll come and pick you up.

15
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,300
It's so late now.

16
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,420
You should forget it.

17
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:06,020
What's wrong with your voice?

18
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,300
Are you unwell?

19
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:09,260
That's not it.

20
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:11,500
I'll get off work now.

21
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:16,460
Mengli!

22
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,140
Mengli, help!

23
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:19,660
Liu Mei fainted!

24
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:21,340
Where is she?

25
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:22,180
She's in the utility room.

26
00:01:25,475 --> 00:01:27,750
(Bai Yu)

27
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:30,340
That Mengli,

28
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,780
why isn't she answering the phone?

29
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,620
Liu Mei is inside this room.

30
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:38,340
Liu Mei?

31
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:44,140
Baihe!

32
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:45,820
Baihe, open the door!

33
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,740
Baihe!

34
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,620
Open the door!

35
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,300
Baihe!

36
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,100
Baihe!

37
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:02,620
Baihe!

38
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:04,900
Hey.

39
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,100
Good job.

40
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,340
You're my best friend indeed.

41
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:08,740
Well...

42
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,740
Nothing will happen to her, right?

43
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:11,100
Come on.

44
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,460
Don't worry.

45
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,780
I'm just locking her here for one night.

46
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:14,780
I'm just teaching her a lesson.

47
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:15,980
Baihe!

48
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,580
(Why are they together?)

49
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:29,700
(Something's off.)

50
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:45,980
Mengli?

51
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,380
Mengli?

52
00:02:58,700 --> 00:02:59,540
Mengli!

53
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:04,525
(Bai Yu)

54
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,460
Don't do it.

55
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,220
Mother,

56
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,060
(please don't leave me.)

57
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,660
Please don't leave me alone.

58
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,660
Someone!

59
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,580
No.

60
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,580
Mother,

61
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,260
please don't leave me!

62
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,820
(Please don't leave me alone!)

63
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,020
Mengli?

64
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:48,340
Mengli!

65
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:49,140
Mengli!

66
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:50,940
Mengli.

67
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:52,540
Mengli?

68
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,500
Mengli?

69
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,660
Bai Yu?

70
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:16,980
Let's talk outside.

71
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:23,740
How's the investigation?

72
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,020
Young Master,

73
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:25,860
I found out the truth.

74
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,420
Lin Miaomiao bribed Baihe to do it.

75
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,460
Moreover,

76
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,580
Director Qian has an unusual relationship
with Lin Miaomiao.

77
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,500
I wonder if she was instigated to do so.

78
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,660
Tell our men to investigate

79
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,020
every property
under the Lin family's name.

80
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,800
Tell the group's Brain Trust
to study and find a breakthrough point.

81
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:44,980
Young Master,

82
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:45,780
are you...

83
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:48,940
They have to pay the price

84
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,180
for messing with Mengli.

85
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:19,740
(Secretary Liu,)

86
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,940
I heard that you were close to Mengli.

87
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,220
No.

88
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,300
We're just ordinary colleagues.

89
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,100
Don't be nervous.

90
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,540
There are many misunderstandings

91
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,020
between me and Mengli

92
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:31,940
due to Miaomiao's matters.

93
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,500
That's why

94
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,420
I wish to find a chance
to explain myself to her.

95
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:37,420
Well,

96
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,380
I see.

97
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,060
Qian Cheng!

98
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,380
Qian Cheng.

99
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,740
This is a warning.

100
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,900
You better stay away from Long Mengli.

101
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,340
If she's hurt again,

102
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,980
I will show you no mercy!

103
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,300
I have a warning for you too.

104
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,700
Everyone has the right
to pursue their love.

105
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,900
You can like Long Mengli,

106
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,460
why can't I?

107
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,380
And

108
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,460
I forgot to tell you this.

109
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,860
I almost couldn't control myself

110
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,340
when I saw Mengli

111
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,540
lying on the sofa that day.

112
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,020
Qian Cheng.

113
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:25,660
Lu Qi.

114
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:25,980
Let's go.

115
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:38,540
Bai Yu,

116
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,180
you will pay

117
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,020
