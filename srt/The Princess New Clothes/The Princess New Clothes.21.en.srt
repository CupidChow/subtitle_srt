Thank goodness.

22
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:02,780
You're alive.

23
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,220
You're not dead.

24
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,060
I'm alive.

25
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:07,300
Your Highness.

26
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,180
I knew you would be safe and sound,

27
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,380
blessed by the heavens.

28
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:17,300
Your back...

29
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:18,980
Where's the wound on your back?

30
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,740
What are you talking about,
Your Highness?

31
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:23,980
I don't understand.

32
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,380
Where am I?

33
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:27,820
Your Highness,

34
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,740
we're in Shishang Town,

35
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:30,380
three hundred li away
from the capital of Northern Liang.

36
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,460
Northern Liang?

37
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,820
Shishang Town?

38
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,020
That means

39
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,860
we had a time travel
and returned together.

40
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,420
A time travel?

41
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:43,900
What does that mean?

42
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,460
It has been a full seven days

43
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,100
since you fell into a coma
due to poisoning.

44
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,740
All the physicians told me

45
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,220
there was no hope for you.

46
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,540
But I had faith that you would wake up.

47
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:54,420
I…

48
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,900
I was unconscious for seven days?

49
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,060
So everything was all a dream?

50
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,140
Were you raised by your grandmother?

51
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,780
How did you know, Your Highness?

52
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,020
But

53
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,700
she passed away three years ago.

54
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:17,740
Your…

55
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,300
Your Highness…

56
00:03:21,226 --> 00:03:22,146
What's this?

57
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:22,860
The…

58
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,220
The jade pendant

59
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:25,340
you gave me.

60
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,180
I'm asking you

61
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,260
why you kept it all this time.

62
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:32,100
Your Highness,

63
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:32,660
I…

64
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,380
I am aware of my lowly status.

65
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,060
I am unworthy of you.

66
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,460
But I swear I will love you
for a lifetime.

67
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,100
Only one lifetime?

68
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,060
I want you

69
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,380
in your next life,

70
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,780
and the one after that.

71
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,580
You'll always be mine.

72
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,260
Do you understand?

73
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:06,860
Yes.

74
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:12,860
Mengli,

75
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,580
whether those experiences

76
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:16,980
were real

77
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:17,900
or just dreams,

78
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:19,820
they no longer matter.

79
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,380
What matters is

80
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:23,980
you're still here.

81
00:04:51,650 --> 00:05:04,850
(Shishang Village)

82
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,380
This is more convenient.

83
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,980
We won't get separated.

84
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,180
Your Highness is right.

85
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,500
Where would you like to go today,

86
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,820
Your Highness?

87
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:30,620
I intend

88
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,660
to do an inspection of the town.

89
00:05:32,771 --> 00:05:34,011
I want to open a clothing store

90
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,580
and design clothes

91
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,780
for the people of Northern Liang.

92
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:38,820
You want to be a tailor?

93
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,060
How did Your Highness
become interested in tailoring?

94
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:42,620
What?

95
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,780
Do you have something against me

96
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,020
being a tailor?

97
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:46,860
No, no.

98
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,260
You can do whatever you want,

99
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,060
as long as it makes you happy.

100
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,460
That's more like it.

101
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,020
In fact, being a tailor…

102
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,060
In fact, being a tailor

103
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,500
isn't any easier than being a princess.

104
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,100
As for the details,

105
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,500
I'll tell you at a later time.

106
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,580
Where's Lu Qi?

107
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,180
Did he go the wrong way?

108
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,140
Let's go back and find him.

109
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:22,300
All right.

110
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:23,980
Sir,

111
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,540
please buy me.

112
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,220
I don't eat a lot, and I work hard.

113
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,020
I can do lots of things.

114
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,300
I can even make clothes.

115
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,940
You won't regret it if you buy me.

116
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,100
Please, sir.

117
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,500
I didn't say I wouldn't buy you.

118
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,460
Niu Qiang?

119
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:42,210
(Five years later,)

120
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:42,730
(the Emperor of Northern Liang
fell ill.)

121
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:44,290

the Empress reigned the court.)
