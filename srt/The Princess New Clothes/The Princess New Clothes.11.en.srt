Miaomiao,

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,960
stop crying.

13
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:43,799
I promise

14
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,520
this won't get out.

15
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:46,600
Well,

16
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:48,358
you can still be a designer
if you ask your dad

17
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:49,520
to get you a job at another company.

18
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:50,478
But

19
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:51,560
it's you who...

20
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,320
Why didn't you help me?

21
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,239
In that situation,

22
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,919
I could only sacrifice you
to defend myself.

23
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,798
Do you want me to lose Mr. Du's trust

24
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:01,799
and eventually get kicked
out of the company?

25
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:03,759
Would your dad approve of us
being together?

26
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,359
Of course not.

27
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:07,920
Even if I can't be a designer anymore,

28
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:10,680
I won't drag you into this.

29
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,000
Thank you, baby.

30
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,200
You're so good to me.

31
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:21,159
(Long Mengli,)

32
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:23,760

00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,839
(Long Mengli is just a country girl.)

34
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,239
(How did she get Du Anqi
to be her backer?)

35
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,078
(And that security guard named Bai Yu.)

36
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:33,120
(What's the relationship between them?)

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,480
Mengli,

38
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,760
congratulations on your promotion.

39
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,480
Please take good care of me
in the future.

40
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:40,920
Mengli,

41
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,759
are you familiar with

42
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,519
Ms. Du?

43
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,040
Excuse me.

44
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:47,680
I'm a bit thirsty.

45
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,760
What is she so proud of?

46
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,480
She's just a deputy team leader.

47
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:57,760
Gosh.

48
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:58,920
There, there, we're all colleagues.

49
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:00,879
(Bai Yu,)

50
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,079
how's my acting?

51
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:03,120
Not bad, right?

52
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:06,480
Yeah.

53
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,640
Not bad.

54
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:08,719
Hey,

55
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,839
you promised me

56
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,439
you'd pretend to be
in a relationship with me to fool my dad.

57
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,680
Can you be a little professional?

58
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,560
Or

59
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,599
did you really fall in love with me?

60
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:20,240
Did you?

61
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:25,120
Mengli.

62
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,599
Mengli.

63
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,520
Mengli.

64
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,280
Your Highness,

65
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,879
let me explain, okay?

66
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,799
Ms. Du Anqi and I...

67
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,759
You don't have to explain.

68
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:41,279
Ms. Du has helped me,

69
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,520
I should be grateful.

70
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,439
As for your personal affairs,

71
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,080
I have no right to ask.

72
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:51,840
I thought

73
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,879
you'd understand my feelings.

74
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,360
Looks like

75
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:00,599
it's just my wishful thinking.

76
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,239
But if you don't tell me,

77
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,520
how will I know?

78
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:08,439
Your Highness.

79
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,199
What did you say

80
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,240
about your feelings?

81
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,639

83

137

That's how you charmed him.

141
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,359
No wonder he's been a different man

142
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,039

(Three years?)

144

(It's been three years
since Bai Yu came to me.)

145
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:20,239
He even worked with that girl
from the Du family

146
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:20,920
(Could it be that...)

147
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,319
to deceive me.

148
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,399
The successor of the Bai family

149
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,199

150

If this matter gets out,

151
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:31,360

152
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:34,959
Mrs. Bai,

153
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:36,120
you've got it wrong.

154
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,199
Just tell me,

155
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:37,920
how much

156
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,480
do you want to leave him?

157
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:42,199
For three years,

158
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:43,318
Bai Yu

159
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,119
has lived

160
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,719
and eaten at my expense,

161
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,758
and received his wages from me.

162
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,679
Nonsense!

163
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,759
Believe it or not, it's up to you.

164
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:49,958
But there's one thing

165
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:51,199
I'd like to remind you of, Mrs. Bai.

166
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:54,279
If you really want to
separate me and Bai Yu,

167
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,720
it's not wise to use this method.

168
00:06:56,965 --> 00:06:58,325
You'll only push him further away.

169
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,839
Instead, it'll bring us closer together.
