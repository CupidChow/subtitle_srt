Grandma!

What are you doing?

15
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:43,820
Open the door!

16
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:44,660
Let me out!

17
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:45,620
Why?

18
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,260
So you can parade yourself on stage
in that frivolous and flamboyant manner?

19
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,420
Don't you realize

20
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,380
that your every word and action

21
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,140
represents the Bai family?

22
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:53,380
Why can't members of the Bai family

23
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:54,540
participate in shows?

24
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:55,300
Grandma,

25
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:56,860
how can you be even more closed-minded

26
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:57,900
than the people from the feudal society?

27
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,100
Open the door!

28
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,060
I'm not arguing with you.

29
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,580
Until this matter settles down,

30
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,300
you're not going anywhere.

31
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,580
You're going to stay at home
and reflect on yourself.

32
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,620
Stay here and keep watch.

33
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,940
No one is to let him out

34
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:10,940
without my orders.

35
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:11,900
Yes,

36
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:12,580
Mrs. Bai.

37
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:17,460
What is the meaning of this?

38
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:18,540
How did we get involved

39
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:19,660
in such a huge scandal all of a sudden?

40
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:20,420
Mr. Du,

41
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:20,940
please don't be anxious.

42
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:21,900
How can I not be?

43
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,380
It's over for this series.

44
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:25,460
Alas.

45
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,420
Everyone thinks that Long Mengli

46
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,180
is Young Master Bai's mistress,

47
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,420
and she even tortures her own father.

48
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:33,220
Goodness.

49
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,500
How is she going to get herself
out of this mess?

50
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,180
Mr. Du.

51
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,300
Actually,

52
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,100
she did plagiarize.

53
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:41,260
What?

54
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:44,820
Since it has come to this,

55
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,260
I'll tell you the truth.

56
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,580
I came up with the original designs

57
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:49,620
for the Dreaming Back
to Northern Liang series.

58
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:50,700
Long Mengli
wanted to use them as references.

59
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,660
I didn't expect that she would…

60
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,340
Why didn't you tell me about this?

61
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,460
She has Young Master Bai's support.

62
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,100
I'm just an ordinary designer.

63
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,700
I don't stand a chance
against the group.

64
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:03,700
This…

65
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:05,380
Right now. Immediately.

66
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,300
Fire

67
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,340
that Long Mengli.

68
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,780
Why was she fired so suddenly?

69
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,100
Is what they're saying
on the internet true?

70
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,100
I don't like the way
she always acts so pretentiously

71
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,260
and arrogantly,

72
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,980
but I don't think she'd stoop that low.

73
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:29,580
The higher-ups

74
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:30,620
don't care about the truth.

75
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,260
All they care about is the stock price.

76
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:35,780
Mengli.

77
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,900
Maybe you should ask Young Master Bai

78
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,180
for help.

79
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,740
His family is influential, right?

80
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:43,780
It's all right.

81
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:44,860
It will be fine.

82
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,060
Don't worry.

83
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:53,860
Let me go!

84
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,820
I'm going to fight those scum!

85
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,420
What do they mean
by a copycat's apprentice

86
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,220
is also a copycat?

87
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,020
They're the ones no better than animals!

88
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:00,940
Calm down.

89
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,700
You'll only make things worse.

90
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,060
Are you telling me
I should just stand idly by

91
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:07,660
and let my apprentice, Li,

92
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,540
be bullied,

93
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,020
and I can't do anything about it?

94
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,740
Why are you only hugging me now?

95
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,380
Do you know how sad I've been lately?

96
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,020
My bad.

97
00:03:22,866 --> 00:03:24,826
Young Master and Her Highness
can't just sit back and wait.

98
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,180
Don't feel bad.

99
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:27,940
All right?

100
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,340
That's right.

101
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,260
Li.

102
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,100
Are you all right?

103
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,140
I'm fine.

104
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:39,740
Weren't you…

105
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:40,780
Well…

106
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,100
It's nothing.

107
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:43,740
That's good.

108
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:45,540
Glad you're all right.

109
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,540
Where's Bai Yu?

110
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,660
Take me to him.

111
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,060
Okay.

112
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:54,900
Mrs. Bai,

113
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,620
Young Master still refuses to eat.

114
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:58,980
That boy…

115
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,900
He won't stop
until he infuriates me to death.

116
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,060
Lu Qi.

117
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,300
Why did you bring her here?

118
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,060
I…

119
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,300
I'm here to break up with Bai Yu.

120
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:11,820
What?

121
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,100
Is that so hard to understand?

122
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,860
I'm in deep trouble,

123
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,540
and he can't do anything to help me.

124
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:18,020
He isn't even anywhere to be found.

125
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,260
Where's Bai Yu?

126
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,860
Tell him to come out and talk to me.

127
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:22,900
Just as well.

128
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:23,980
Go

129
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,540
and get Young Master Bai.

130
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:26,420
Yes,

131
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,220
Mrs. Bai.

132
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,340
This way, Young Master.

133
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:47,380
Mengli.

134
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,020
How have you been, Mengli?

135
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,020
Let's not see each other

136
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:00,940
anymore.

137
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,060
I won't make

138
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,180
the same mistake twice.

139
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:05,620
Mengli?

140
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:07,300
Mengli!

141
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,500
Stop!

142
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,740
I'm surrounded by enemies.

143
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,060
Everything feels like
it's back to the beginning.

144
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,300
Just like that night.

145
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,540
Well?

146
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,140
Have you made up your mind?

147
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,500
If you can be my concubine

148
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:57,580
and hand over the tiger tally.

149
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,380
I promise,

150
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,940
I won't hurt your men.

151
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,940
You can have the tally.

152
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,660
But for me to be your concubine?

153
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,780
Never.

154
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,220
I was going to give you a chance

155
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,620
for the sake of us
being childhood friends.

156
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:25,900
Pity…

157
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:26,820
You don't care

158
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:27,980
about that!

159
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,140
The only reason you want me
to be your concubine

160
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:30,940
is because of

161
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,340
my reputation among the people.

162
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,300
Mengli,

163
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,980
do you know what your biggest flaw is?

164
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:39,613
You're too strong-headed.

165
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:42,340
Since we were young,
you've always shown your sharpness.

166
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,180
You've never concealed your abilities.

167
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,340
Sometimes,

168
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,620
showing weakness

169
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,420
is also a tactic.

170
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:11,620
You're here.

171
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:11,900
Yes.

172
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,300
Come in.

173
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,340
Ms. Du,

174
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:21,900
do you believe me?

175
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:23,500
Of course.

176
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,620
But it's useless
if I'm the only one who believes you.

177
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,260
Of course, it does.

178
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,220
I'm not the only one

179
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,740
this matter concerns.

180
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,260
It concerns the Du family

181
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,660
and the entire LK.

182
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,980
What do you mean?

183
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:35,820
Wait here.

184
00:07:36,453 --> 00:07:38,053
You'll know when you see this person.

185
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:44,260
She's here.

186
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,100
Lin Miaomiao?
