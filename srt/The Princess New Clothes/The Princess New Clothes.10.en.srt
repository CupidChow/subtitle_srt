11
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:49,359
Your Highness,
get some good rest tonight.

12
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,799
I'll pick you up in the morning.

13
00:00:51,129 --> 00:00:51,759
Let's just

14
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:52,799
stick to the plan.

15
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:53,280
Okay.

16
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,359
Well,

17
00:00:57,159 --> 00:00:58,039
I'm leaving now.

18
00:00:58,039 --> 00:00:58,640
Alright.

19
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,280
I'm really leaving.

20
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:02,240
Okay,

21
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,399
just leave.

22
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,280
Bye-bye.

23
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:07,680
Alright.

24
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,560
Bai Yu.

25
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:11,840
Your Highness.

26
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,280
It's

27
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,280
getting late.

28
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,319
It's been

29
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:20,599
a long day for you.

30
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,359
Yeah.

31
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:22,760
Why don't you

32
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,599
take this and eat it on your way back?

33
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:36,200
Thank...

34
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:37,560
Thank you, Your Highness.

35
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:41,200
I'll head back now.

36
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,159
Okay.

37
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,120
Baihe,

38
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,359
I've told you many times

39
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:52,719
you can't draft a design that way.

40
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,640
I'm sorry.

41
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,760
I'll fix it right away.

42
00:01:57,799 --> 00:01:58,760
Gosh,

43
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:01,560
I wonder who's messing up the company.

44
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:03,400
So it's my old classmate.

45
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,599
You haven't changed a bit

46
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,840
after all these years.

47
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,199
You like to bully people

48
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,360
with a few dimes
in your father's pocket.

49
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,080
You're right, Ms. Du.

50
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,039
Ms. Lin

51
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,520
is very good at bullying people.

52
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:22,400
Long Mengli,

53
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,800
what are you doing here?

54
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,719
Ms. Du invited me here.

55
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:27,159
That's right.

56
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:29,560
A new broom sweeps clean.

57
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,800
I'm going to investigate the plagiarism

58
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,960
on my first day on the job.

59
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:35,360
Ms. Du,

60
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,400
I think you must have misunderstood.

61
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,639
I'm the victim

62
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,800
in this matter.

63
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,960
I'll find out

64
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,400
if it's a misunderstanding.

65
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,360
What are you doing?

66
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:48,520
Don't you have to work?

67
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,120
Wow.

68
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:52,199
Ms. Du,

69
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,199
even though you're the VP,

70
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:56,639
you're not in charge of
the design department.

71
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,639
Does Mr. Du

72
00:02:58,639 --> 00:02:59,599
know about this?

73
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:03,439
Mr. Du has authorized Ms. Du

74
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,639
to handle all matters.

75
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:06,800
If you don't believe me,

76
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,800
you can ask him yourself.

77
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:20,719
I believe you.

78
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:21,919
Of course, I do.

79
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,960
Let's get started then.

80
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:27,599
In the interest of fairness,

81
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,879
we need an outsider to bear witness.

82
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:36,039
Why don't we

83
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:37,680
let him be the witness?

84
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:57,919
Ms. Lin, since you said

85
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,039
I plagiarized your design,

86
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:02,400
can you tell me

87
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,479
your inspiration,

88
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:05,120
design ideas,

89
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:06,960
or your references?

90
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,199
I have already

91
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,000
deleted them.

92
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,199
Then why do I have them?

93
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:19,040
Guys, please take a look at the folder
in front of you,

94
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,040
which contains all the design ideas

95
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,199
of my spring design this year,

96
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,720
including a few rejected drafts.

97
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,399
What can this explain?

98
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,480
You must have
intentionally deleted my drafts

99
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:35,759
and falsified them.

100
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,199
Yes.

101
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,879
That's possible.

102
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:42,600
It's really strange.

103
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,800
There are so many suspicious points,

104
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,040
but Director Qian

105
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,839
chose to believe the least probable one.

106
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:50,360
What do you know about design

107
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,319
as a watchdog?

108
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:53,480
Anyone with a brain

109
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,000
can see what's going on.

110
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,120
We don't need to know anything
about design.

111
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,079
You...

112
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,639
Alright.

113
00:04:58,639 --> 00:04:59,439
Stop it.

114
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,720
Go on.

115
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,639
(Certificate of Registration of Work)
What about this certificate?

116
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,839
Am I so powerful

117
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:12,680
that I can apply for Ms. Lin's design

118
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,759
before it's finished?

119
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,279
Qi!

120
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:24,839
Ms. Du,

121
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:25,879
he has already admitted to

122
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:26,639
secretly deleting

123
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,240
the surveillance footage of
the night before the competition.

124
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:31,199
Yu.

125
00:05:32,264 --> 00:05:33,480
Speak for yourself.

126
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,639
Ms. Lin gave me a lot of money.

127
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:38,759
I never saw that much money!

128
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,959
I can provide you
with the transfer records.

129
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:41,120
Nonsense!

130
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,439
You're the ones who set me up.

131
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,120
I'm going to get the best lawyer
and sue you!

132
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:48,680
Enough, Lin Miaomiao.

133
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,959
Don't you realize you've made a mistake?

134
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:54,680
Lin Miaomiao

135
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:56,040
is immediately fired

136
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:57,519
for plagiarizing

137
00:05:57,927 --> 00:05:58,680
and framing her colleague.

138
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:00,319
Long Mengli is reinstated

139
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:01,639
as

140
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,480
a deputy team leader.

141
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,800
Hey, wait a minute.

142
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:08,920
Ms. Lin,

143
00:06:09,525 --> 00:06:11,285
I'm responsible for this.

144
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,920
I'll explain it to Mr. Du personally.

145
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:13,879
If there's nothing else,

146
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:14,720
I'll take my leave.
