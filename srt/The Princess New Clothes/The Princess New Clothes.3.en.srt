11
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:08,359
Your Majesty.

12
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:14,120
Father has decided to pass the throne
to Second Brother.

13
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:16,319
Looks like we have to
make an earlier move.

14
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,439
Luckily, you wield military power.

15
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:19,760
Thus, we have a good chance of winning.

16
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:23,719
But...

17
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,799
Mengli,

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,480
we grew up together.

19
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,040
If you don't help me,

20
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:33,159
I will die a tragic death.

21
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:34,760
Once I ascend to the throne,

22
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,200
I will immediately crown you
as the Empress.

23
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,359
I will never forsake you.

24
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:40,040
Okay,

25
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:42,079
I will do my best to help you.

26
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,599
(Miss,)

27
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:53,439
are you alright?

28
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,799
Why are you here?

29
00:01:59,079 --> 00:01:59,760
Pretty lady,

30
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,719
do we know each other?

31
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,439
Well...

32
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:03,799
Don't you remember me?

33
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,520
I do now.

34
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:18,280
How charming.

35
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:19,639
Liu Mei,

36
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:20,840
who is he?

37
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:24,719
He is Qian Cheng,
the Chief Designer of LK.

38
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,840
You're here for an interview.

39
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,879
Don't tell me you don't know him.

40
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,039
Liu Mei,

41
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:30,840
I've got stuff to do.

42
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,039
I'll leave now.

43
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:32,719
What?

44
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,120
Are you not interviewing anymore?

45
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,360
Hey!

46
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:43,439
Young Master,

47
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,919
after ages of looking for the Princess,

48
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:46,280
why

49
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:48,159
did you stop and not meet her?

50
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,700
(Northern Liang Border Map)

51
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,520
You're here.

52
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:05,840
Your Highness,

53
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:07,599
the weather is getting cold.

54
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,439
Do keep yourself warm.

55
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,400
Bai Yu,

56
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,360
what do you think

57
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,240
about the invasion
of Northern Barbarians?

58
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:16,840
Most in the imperial court

59
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,360
advocate peace negotiations,

60
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,240
but I think

61
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,000
the group is extremely ambitious,

62
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,039
with a bottomless pit of desire.

63
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,879
If we back down,

64
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:27,319
it will only make them more arrogant.

65
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:28,319
You are right.

66
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,960
When there is no way back,

67
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,439
we can only get trampled on.

68
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,400
Only by defeating them

69
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,280
can we maintain the peace
and stability of Northern Liang.

70
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,120
I swear my loyalty to Your Highness.

71
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,800
Let's not talk about it.

72
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,960
Let's go.

73
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:51,759
Director,

74
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:52,479
did you ask for me?

75
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,159
What's the name

76
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,000
of that girl just now?

77
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:57,360
Well, she's Long Mengli.

78
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,800
She came for a designer job interview.

79
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,000
Okay,

80
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:01,840
that's all.

81
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,639
You may leave now.

82
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,120
Okay.

83
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:04,879
Fine.

84
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,639
Long Mengli.

85
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,039
Interesting.

86
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,439
Long Mengli,

87
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,439
are you going to back down

88
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:21,839
just because of a familiar face?

89
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,639
For now, even if that person
is standing in front of you,

90
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,839
you should not even frown.

91
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,439
Only this is worthy

92
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,040
of the title
of Northern Liang Warrior Princess.

93
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:45,839
Where's my design draft?

94
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:55,240
(I swear my loyalty to Your Highness.)

95
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:04,600
Bai Yu, leader of the Northern Liang
Imperial Guards Battalion,

96
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,920
is here to greet Your Highness.

97
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:09,759
Bai Yu?

98
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,959
It's weird.

99
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:13,759
Where is she?

100
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,240
Does this

101
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:17,439
belong to Long Mengli?

102
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,720
What?

103
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:19,959
Well.

104
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:20,759
Yes.

105
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:21,759
Do you know her?

106
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,360
I am her subordinate, Lu Qi.

107
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,360
Just hand it to me.

108
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:25,879
Okay.

109
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,160
Subordinate?

110
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,959
(Bai Yu,)

111
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,079
I remember
when I went against the barbarians

112
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:34,439
and accidentally got injured,

113
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:37,439
you had the same expression.

114
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,439
Your Highness,

115
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:41,800
I'd never be mad at you.

116
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm mad at myself
for not protecting you well.

117
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,319
Ever since I saw you

118
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:48,120
drink the poisonous wine

119
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,240
and fall in front of me,

120
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,680
I swear,

121
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:51,600
from now on,

122
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,160
I would not let you
suffer from any harm.

123
00:05:58,519 --> 00:05:59,439
Don't worry.

124
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,000
This kind of incident

125
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,639
won't happen again.

126
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:03,879
Yes.

127
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,279
By the way,

128
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,360
why are you here?

129
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,279
What about Lu Qi?

130
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,240
Your Highness,

131
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,639
we are working as security guards at LK.

132
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:16,319
Lu Qi is on duty now.

133
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,759
I see.

134
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:20,279
Presumably,

135
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,600
since both of you just arrived here,

136
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,920
you must still be getting used to it.

137
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,600
Yes.

138
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,639
Do you have a place to stay?

139
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:26,160
Your Highness,

140
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,439
the company has dormitories,

141
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:29,680
and the environment is pretty good.

142
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:31,439
Great.

143
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,399
By the way.

144
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,439
Now that we are no longer
in Northern Liang,

145
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:37,360
we can drop the formalities.

146
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:39,920
From now on,

147
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,959
just call each other by name.

148
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:42,879
Okay.

149
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:43,439
Your...

150
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,600
Mengli.

151
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:53,399
Bai Yu,

152
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,079
your ears turned red.

153
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,399
I remember that when you were
in Northern Liang,

154
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,639
many girls presented you
with their pouches.

155
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:03,800
Why are you still so shy?

156
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,800
Because

157
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,079
they are not you.

158
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:08,639
Wait, what did you say?

159
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:09,920
No, nothing.

160
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,560
By the way,

161
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:12,319
Your Highness.

162
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,680
Why did you come to this company?

163
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:15,240
To apply for
the fashion designer position.

164
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,399
Fashion designer?

165
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,959
This matter is a long story,

166
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:21,079
I will tell you slowly in the future.

167
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,680
In short,

168
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,839
I must get into this company.

169
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,199
No worries,

170
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,000
You could sort everything out.

171
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:32,000
You are right,

172
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:33,759
there's nothing I want to do

173
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,680
that can't be done.

174
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:38,879
Young Master,

175
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:39,959
why didn't you tell the Third Princess

176
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:40,920
who we really are?

177
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:42,519
As long as you give Mr. Du a call,

178
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:44,160
you can help her get into LK.

179
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,839
If she knows

180
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,519
my identity,

181
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,560
considering her character,

182
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,240
she will never agree
to preferential treatment.

183
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,439
By the way,

184
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:53,399
this is the design draft
the Third Princess left behind.

185
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:54,279
What should we do about it?

186
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:56,425
(To Long Mengli)

187
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:02,600
Lu Qi,

188
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,959
ask someone to call Mr. Du

189
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:05,000
in the name of the Bai family at once.

190
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:07,720
Didn't you say no special treatments
for the Third Princess?

191
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,279
Don't worry,

192
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:11,480
I have other plans.

193
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,759
