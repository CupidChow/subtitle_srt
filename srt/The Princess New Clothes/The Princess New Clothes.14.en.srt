Qian Cheng!

12

What should I do?

13
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,340
My family declared bankruptcy.

14
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:57,780
My dad said

15
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,500
I offended someone I shouldn't.

16
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:02,660
Qian Cheng,

17
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:03,420
I have nowhere to go.

18
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,020
So?

19
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,380
Why are you here?

20
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,100
I have nowhere to go now.

21
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,700
Qian Cheng, what should I do?

22
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,020
I'm sorry,

23
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:14,100
Ms. Lin.

24
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:15,220
I barely know you.

25
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:16,820
I am under no obligation

26
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,140
to provide you with accommodation.

27
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:21,540
Barely know me?

28
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,020
Qian Cheng,

29
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,940
don't be too outrageous.

30
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,380
How much money have I spent on you,

31
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,220
how many gifts have I given you,

32
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:32,180
and you've forgotten them all?

33
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,260
We simply take what we need.

34
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,860
Didn't you get a lot

35
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,420
from me too?

36
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,860
Not to mention a perfect boyfriend.

37
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:43,380
You're shameless.

38
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:47,380
Lin Miaomiao,

39
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,140
for me, Qian Cheng,

40
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,500
a worthless person

41
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,260
is no different from a dog.

42
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,260
Remember,

43
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,380
don't look for me again.

44
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,700
Qian Cheng,

45
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,380
you jerk!

46
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:06,740
Bai Yu,

47
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,380
about Lin Miaomiao...

48
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:09,980
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

49
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,540
I had to do that.

50
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,060
I couldn't take it anymore.

51
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,940
Did I say you did something wrong?

52
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,620
What goes around

53
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,260
comes around.

54
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,020
I was more vicious back then than you.

55
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,500
It's just that if this matter

56
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,140
gets to Mrs. Bai,

57
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,260
I'm afraid she will say

58
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,940
that I'm somewhat spoiled.

59
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:33,500
Don't worry.

60
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,580
Although Grandma
is prejudiced against you,

61
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:36,220
it is unlikely...

62
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,100
Unlikely what?

63
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:46,820
Well,

64
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,580
not only am I somewhat spoiled,

65
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,500
but I'm also vicious

66
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,540
and vengeful.

67
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,100
Anyone who dares hurt me

68
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,700
must pay the price.

69
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,460
Mr. Bai,

70
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:58,780
are you afraid?

71
00:02:59,340 --> 00:02:59,980
Not at all.

72
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,340
I'm not afraid of anything

73
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,540
except losing you.

What do you smell?

Boss,

91
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,340
you are a few years older than me,

92
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,180
drop the formalities.

93
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,380
Why?

94
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:54,500
Do you think I'm old?

95
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,420
Niu Qiang?

96
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:57,540
Why is she here?

00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:58,660
No, no.

98
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,820
I don't mean that.

99
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,300
Let's talk.

100
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,380
It's not impossible

101
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,900
if you want to get steamy.

102
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:08,740
Ouch!

103
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:14,260
I broke my leg and it hurts.

104
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,180
Let me tell you,

105
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,340
this place is monitored.

106
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,500
Don't try to blackmail me.

107
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,460
I'm holding on to you now.

108
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,300

Qi,

00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,580
do you see what this is?

111
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:33,700
Just accept your fate,

112
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,380
you won't be able to escape from me.

113
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:44,940
Mengli,

114
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,420
take two more days off

115
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:47,540
and rest at home.

116
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,420
Don't go back to work in a rush.

117
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:50,760
I can't.

118
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,300
It's less than a week

119
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,860
before the men's clothing launch.

120
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:55,860
But...

121
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:57,860
Hold on.

122
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:01,380
Hello.

123
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:02,820
Grandma?

124
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,220
I got it.

125
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,580
I will be back at once.

126
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:09,620
All right then.

127
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,100
If it is not possible,

128
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,060
you apply to the company

129
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,380
to draft the design at home.

130
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,020
With Niu Qiang around,

131
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,180
I feel more at ease.

132
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,460
Okay,

133
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:19,860
let me try.

134
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:20,660
Yes.

135
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:22,780
Well, I'm leaving.

136
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:24,180
Okay.

137
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:28,260
Hold on.

138
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:36,820
When you go back,

139
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,900
talk to your grandma nicely.

140
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,140
After all, she is the only elder
in your family.

141
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:43,140
Sure,

142
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,180
I got it.

143
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:53,540
I'm leaving now.

144
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:54,700
Okay.

145
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:57,340
(Kneel!)

146
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,860
For a girl from the countryside,

147
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,020
how dare you use our family resources

148
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,020
to suppress the Lin Group?

149
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:07,820
If you do this,

150
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,620
can you live up
to your great-grandfather,

151
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,540
who worked hard
to start the business back in the day?

152
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,980
Can you live up to the spirits

153
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,500
of your deceased parents in heaven?

154
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:17,780
Grandma,

155
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,860
Mengli is not some girl
from the countryside.

156
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,140
She is the love of my life.

157
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:23,540
Besides,

158
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,300
the Lin family is by no means kind.

159
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,140
Enough!

160
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,100
You are now bewitched.

161
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:30,860
You don't even know

162
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,340
what you're doing.

163
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,180
Liu Mei,

164
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:39,700
what brings you here?

165
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:40,620
Come in.

166
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,020
Mengli.

167
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:43,420
Yes?

168
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:44,620
I...

169
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,900
I heard that you were sick.

170
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,380
Yet, I was too busy with work.

171
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,580
I couldn't visit you in time,

172
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,100
so I asked Liu Mei to bring me here.

173
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:52,740
Mengli,

174
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,180
Director Qian came to apologize.

175
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,260
Just accept his apology for my sake,

176
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,220
okay?

177
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,180
Let's talk about it inside.

178
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,520
Mengli,

179
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,540
although I am also a victim

180
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,500
of Miaomiao,

181
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,060
I still want to apologize in person.

182
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:21,580
I'm sorry,

183
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,900
can you forgive me?

184
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,140
Don't mention it, Director Qian,

185
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,460
it's too much for me to hold.

186
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,300
You are still a newbie.

187
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,220
The fashion design industry
is not that huge.

188
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,780
We still have to
work together after this.

189
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,020
Having one more friend
is always better than

190
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,020
having one more enemy, right?
