Young Master,

12
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,679
madam said...

13
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,479
That's the case,

14
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:53,000
you know?

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,600
Grandma.

16
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,880
I'm sorry about today.

17
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,479
Please don't be offended,

18
00:00:58,479 --> 00:00:59,520
Ms. Long.

19
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,280
Mrs. Bai, it's not that serious.

20
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:00,759
Grandma.

21
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:01,759
As a junior,

22
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:03,079
it's only right for me to visit you.

23
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,319
Mengli?

24
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,599
Then I won't ask you to stay any longer.

25
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:09,280
Let's have a good chat some other time.

26
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,000
Sure.

27
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:17,719
Your Highness.

28
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,359
Your Highness.

29
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:24,000
Your Highness,

30
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:25,400
are you alright?

31
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:28,280
Bai Yu,

32
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,519
how much longer
were you going to lie to me?

33
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:32,760
Your Highness, I...

34
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,080
I knew you'd be here.

35
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:12,360
Your Highness,

36
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,039
I'm sorry.

37
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:17,360
I really didn't mean to lie to you.

38
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,159
Bai Yu.

39
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,520
We've been through so much together.

40
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,759
We've even been through
life and death as well.

41
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,639
Am I

42
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:33,039
not worthy of your trust?

43
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:34,960
Your Highness,

44
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:36,400
I'm sorry.

45
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:37,840
Please forgive me.

46
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,039
Get up.

47
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,800
I won't get up

48
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,520
until you forgive me.

49
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,719
(Bai Yu,)

50
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,039
(I'm not mad at you
for hiding your identity,)

51
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:51,919
(but I hate not being trusted.)

52
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:53,000
(Do you understand?)

53
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:55,199
(Your Highness,)

54
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:56,919
(it's not that I don't trust you.)

55
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,319
(It's just that I have no confidence
in myself.)

56
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:01,120
(I dare not bet on it.)

57
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:21,680
(Silly boy.)

58
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,159
(Whether in Northern Liang or here,)

59
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,680
(you're very important)

60
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,800
(to me.)

61
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,599
Jeez!

62
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:30,800
Ridiculous!

63
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,639
You're being ridiculous!

64
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,840
I thought you've done me a great honor

65
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:36,680
by handling the young master
of the Bai family.

66
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,840
Who knows that you get me
into so much trouble?

67
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,520
Dad,

68
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:42,000
do you have to be so mad?

69
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:43,599
It's just dismissing

70
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:44,840
a nouveau riche's daughter.

71
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,680
Why are you so worried?

72
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,319
Of course, I should be worried.

73
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,479
The Lin family is nothing.

74
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,560
I'm worried Mrs. Bai

75
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,560
will make trouble for us.

76
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,520
It seems that we can't keep

77
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:58,479
Long Mengli.

78
00:03:58,479 --> 00:03:59,479
We have to get rid of her
as soon as possible.

79
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,520
Dad,

80
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:04,400
you need to think this through.

81
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:07,520
Now, Mrs. Bai has the final say.

82
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:09,639
But in a few years,

83
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,400
it'll be Bai Yu has the final say.

84
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,919
If we fire his beloved woman

85
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,360
for no reason,

86
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:18,920
we'll get

87
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,000
even worse retaliation.

88
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,560
Well,

89
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,120
you have a point.

90
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:25,600
But what are we going to tell

91
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,639
Mrs. Bai?

92
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:30,240
Well,

93
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,439
you've been worrying about
men's clothing lately, haven't you?

94
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:32,959
Yes.

95
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:34,600
Why don't

96
00:04:34,998 --> 00:04:37,118
we leave this difficult task

97
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,040
to Long Mengli?

98
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,800
If she screws up,

99
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,680
we can ask her to resign

100
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,600
rightfully.

101
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,519
That way, we can explain

102
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,279
to Mrs. Bai.

103
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:49,399
(Mengli,)

104
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,040
I promised Grandma
I'd go to work for Bai Group,

105
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,879
so I won't be able
to dine with you anymore.

106
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,839
Am I so crippled

107
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:58,519
that I'll starve to death without you?

108
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,600
No.

109
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,680
It's me who can't leave you

110
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,040
and wants to be with you every day.

111
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,560
But Mrs. Bai said

112
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:11,360
I'm too lowly

113
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,199
to be a match for the young master
of the Bai family,

114
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,560
so she wants me

115
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,040
to leave you.

116
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:19,120
Your Highness.

117
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:22,120
So I made a bet with her.

118
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:27,600
Based on your looks and courage,

119
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:29,519
you're a good match

120
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,879
for Bai Yu.

121
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,720
However,

122
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:34,720
you're from a poor family.

123
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,920
A dragon can soar in the sky
even if it's stuck in the shallows.

124
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,879
How do you know

125
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:41,240
I won't make a name for myself?

126
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,279
Give me one year.

127
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,000
Within a year,

128
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,480
I'll make a name for myself
in the design industry.

129
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,560
If you can do that,

130
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,439
I'll accept you

131
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:53,560
as my granddaughter-in-law.

132
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:55,439
Deal.

133
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,319
I'll take a different approach
to solving the problem.

134
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,560
That's why I asked Ms. Du to help me.

135
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,839
But isn't that too risky?

136
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:05,120
Your Highness, don't worry.

137
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:06,480
Leave Grandma to me.

138
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,079
I'll never let her
make things difficult for you.

139
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:16,879
Well,

140
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:17,879
I am not doing it all for you.

141
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:19,680
My boss and I think

142
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,759
there's a huge demand
for men's clothing,

143
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:23,040
so it might be a good opportunity.

144
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,000
Well,

145
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:26,839
is there anything I can do to help?

146
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,480
Isn't the plot

147
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,279
developing too fast?

148
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,839
Move in with me.

149
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:48,879
What?

150
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,000
What?

151
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,480
I need a male model.

152
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:57,079
Well,

153
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,160
I see.

154
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,399
Bai Yu,

155
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,040
what did you have in mind?

156
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:04,959
Nothing.

157
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:06,199
