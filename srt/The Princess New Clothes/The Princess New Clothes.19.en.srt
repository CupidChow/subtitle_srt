11
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:48,060
Young Master,

12
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:48,900
you…

13
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:51,380
Bai Yu.

14
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:53,220
I know you're upset.

15
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,100
But you shouldn't
torture yourself like this.

16
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,660
I'm not torturing myself.

17
00:00:59,018 --> 00:01:01,138
I just want to eat more

18
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,180
to restore my strength.

19
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,980
Aren't you even the slightest bit upset?

20
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:08,940
Upset?

21
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:10,620
Why?

22
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,180
Mengli proposed to me.

23
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:13,380
- Proposed?
- Proposed?

24
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:13,860
Yes.

25
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:20,420
This is the betrothal gift.

26
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:22,260
She's going

27
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:23,900
to marry me.

28
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,900
But she just said

29
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,940
she wouldn't see you anymore.

30
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,540
According to the customs
of Northern Liang,

31
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,334
the bride and groom
shouldn't meet in private

32
00:01:32,334 --> 00:01:33,100
once they are betrothed.

33
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,100
Northern Liang?

34
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:36,460
Princess?

35
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,700
Betrothal gifts?

36
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,460
What are you guys talking about?

37
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:46,580
Grandma,

38
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,980
Mengli isn't some girl
from the countryside.

39
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,820
She's the beloved Third Princess
of the people of Northern Liang,

40
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,060
and also my savior.

41
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:56,420
What?

42
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,020
The board of directors is going
to make their move next week?

43
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,100
They're going to fire…

44
00:01:59,100 --> 00:01:59,860
Qian Cheng.

45
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,180
Senior?

46
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,220
It's been a while.

47
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:06,660
Tell me.

48
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,140
What will it take for you
to let Long Mengli go?

49
00:02:10,227 --> 00:02:11,227
What do you mean?

50
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:12,740
Oh.

51
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:16,060
She's your direct disciple.

52
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,300
What a fateful coincidence,

53
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,500
indeed.

54
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,180
I know

55
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,940
what schemes you're plotting.

56
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,740
You stole my design
and sold it to the rival,

57
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,180
and accused me of plagiarism back then.

58
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,300
Now, you're jealous
of Long Mengli's talent.

59
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,020
You want to get her kicked out
of the industry.

60
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,420
Liu Qiang.

61
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,460
I address you as senior

62
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,620
out of courtesy.

63
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,580
But that doesn't mean

64
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,980
you can slander me

65
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,140
without proof.

66
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,220
You and Long Mengli brought this

67
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,060
upon yourselves.

68
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,380
I had nothing to do with it.

69
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,380
Junior.

70
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,460
Li came from the countryside.

71
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,140
She doesn't have it easy.

72
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,820
Can't you show her

73
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,580
some mercy?

74
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:00,980
Sorry.

75
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,500
I'm busy.

76
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:15,940
I told you

77
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,660
he was too sly

78
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,940
to fall for that so easily.

79
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:20,780
It's fine.

80
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,340
I expected this.

81
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,140
We want to make him think

82
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,820
that we're at our wit's end,

83
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,820
so he lets his guard down

84
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,100
and makes it easier for us
to take him down in one strike.

85
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,740
Hey.

86
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,100
Brat.

87
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,260
Watch where you're going.

88
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,300
What's with that look in your eyes?

89
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,260
You…

90
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,140
Oh.

91
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,420
Sorry.

92
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,580
You two

93
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,460
are the security guards?

94
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:07,940
I won't bother you then.

95
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:09,340
See you.

96
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:10,700
Hey!

97
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:11,620
Talk.

98
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,460
What did you do to Long Mengli?

99
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:14,460
No...

100
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,700
Nothing…

101
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:16,420
I…

102
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,620
I haven't dared to approach her again.

103
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,540
You haven't.

104
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,860
But you've been
saying things you shouldn't,

105
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:23,740
making her life a mess.

106
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,340
You know that?

107
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:25,300
I…

108
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:26,660
I'll talk.

109
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,860
I'll tell you everything.

110
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:28,780
Someone…

111
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,140
Someone paid me.

112
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:31,860
They

113
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,860
forced me to say what they made up.

114
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:34,860
But I didn't…

115
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,820
Shut up.

116
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,100
Tell me everything.

117
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,140
Or

118
00:04:39,627 --> 00:04:41,547
I'll make sure you never speak again.

119
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,020
I'll talk.

120
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,300
I'll cooperate.

121
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,180
Mengli?

122
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,940
I found what you wanted.

123
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,420
Secretary Liu,

124
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,020
did you touch my things in my office?

125
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,100
Director Qian,
you shouldn't make accusations

126
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,540
without proof.

127
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:16,660
Why are you here?

128
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:21,180
Didn't you say
you were thinking of me and sleepless,

129
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,740
tossing and turning?

130
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,340
What?

131
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,100
Afraid to see me?

132
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,700
If you have something to say, say it.

133
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,660
Or I'm calling security.

134
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,780
You're a real scumbag, aren't you?

135
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:32,700
How was I so blind

136
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,140
to have fallen for you?

137
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:36,460
What do you mean?

138
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:37,820
Security.

139
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:38,820
Security.

140
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:41,820
Director Qian.

141
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,460
It's been a long time.

142
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,500
Why are you guys here?

143
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:48,500
I had them

144
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,540
come here.

145
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:50,500
Mr. Du?

146
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,020
Well, Qian Cheng.

147
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:53,900
For years,

148
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,180
you've been selling
the company's secrets.

149
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,660
It's all thanks to Mengli.

150
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:01,653
She gave me the contract
of you selling our company's designs

151
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:02,340
to our rivals.

152
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,420
You betrayed me!

153
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,580
I can explain.

154
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:06,860
This is all Long Mengli's scheme!

155
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,380
Shut up!

156
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,420
The Fashion Design Association
has decided

157
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,020
to remove your name permanently.

158
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,020
Director Qian,

159
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,980
your reputation
will be in pieces in no time.

160
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,620
Here's one last piece of advice for you.

161
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,700
Never underestimate women.

162
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:23,500
Right.

163
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,740
Never underestimate women.

164
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:25,460
Young Master Bai,

165
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:26,940
please throw him out.

166
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,140
Never let him set foot
in this office again!

167
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,060
Yes.

168
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,060
Mr. Du!

169
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:34,620
Let me explain!

170
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,420
Mr. Du!

171
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,620
Throw him out!

172
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:37,540
Long Mengli!

173
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,700
I'll get you for this!

174
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:40,820
Mengli,

175
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,500
I have you to thank for all of this.

176
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,420
I've decided

177
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,340
to appoint you
as the new director of design.

178
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,740
You can come back anytime.

179
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,940
I appreciate it, Mr. Du.

180
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,420
But

181
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,100
I have other arrangements.

182
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,100
I see.

183
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,100
Let me know if you ever need

184
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:55,620
my help.

185
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,380
Don't hold back.

186
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:57,660
Thank you.

187
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:58,420
All right.

188
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:01,740
Goodbye.

189
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,180
Water in place of liquor.

190
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:08,340
Congratulations.

191
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,580
You won both in love and career.

192
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,020
Mr. Du gave you a promotion?

193
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:17,300
Yes,

194
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,620
he did.

195
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,620
But I didn't accept it.

196
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,580
Why?

197
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,860
I've already made a decision.

198
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,500
I want to start

199
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,860
a fashion design studio with you.

200
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:27,780
A studio?

201
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:28,860
With me?

202
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,020
Master,

203
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,980
your talent shouldn't be wasted.

204
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,340
You have your dreams.

205
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,580
Let's start over.

206
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,020
But I…

207
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,140
Have you guys seen Young Master Bai?

208
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:43,780
Wasn't he with you?

209
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,740
I haven't been able to reach him
since last night.
