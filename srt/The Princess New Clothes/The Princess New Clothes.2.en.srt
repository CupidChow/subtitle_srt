Stop.

12
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:50,119
Attack!

13
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:03,840
Run!

14
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,519
Give chase!

15
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,200
Give chase!

16
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,919
(I finally understand)

17
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,200
(why that car accident
sent Lu Qi and me to this strange era.)

18
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:22,959
(It turns out it was all to meet you.)

19
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,760
Are you freaking out?

20
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:27,518
I'm still bleeding.

21
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:28,159
Oh.

22
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:29,239
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:40,719
Done.

24
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,840
What's your name?

25
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:49,640
My name is Bai Yu.

26
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:56,519
Take this jade pendant.

27
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,640
You shall be with me from now on.

28
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,039
(Your Highness.)

29
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,159
(I must find you.)

30
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,319
Fashion designer?

31
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,080
I guess it's like the person in charge
of the Imperial Apparel Department.

32
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,239
Momo Su who used to accompany me

33
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,080
once worked in
the Imperial Apparel Department.

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,360
I've heard of it.

35
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,280
These designs are beautiful,

36
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,718
but they lack something

37
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:46,400
that leaves a lasting impression.

38
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,319
(I'm into)

39
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:20,240
(handsome guys.)

40
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:21,519
(However,)

41
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,759
(it's a little awkward.)

42
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:24,759
Are you done staring?

43
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,199
(Long Mengli)
Excuse me.

44
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,800
I didn't know someone was in the car.

45
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,240
Hold on.

46
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:37,199
This document belongs to Long Mengli?

47
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:38,919
Yes.

48
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:39,840
So what?

49
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,800
Do you know her?

50
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:42,199
Can you take me to her?

51
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:46,638
I don't know her.

52
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:47,800
How can I take you to her?

53
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,438
Even if I know her,

54
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:50,599
I wouldn't take you to her.

55
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,080
You're a stranger.

56
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:53,038
What should I do

57
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:53,599
if you're a bad guy?

58
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,599
Do I look like a bad guy?

59
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:57,718
Bad guys

60
00:03:57,719 --> 00:03:59,719
won't show that they're bad.

61
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:05,520
Li.

62
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:06,439
Your parcel.

63
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,360
It seems to be from LK Company.

64
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,158
By the way,

65
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:12,478
I met a crazy person just now

66
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:13,599
who asked me if I knew you.

67
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:15,639
He asked me to take him to you.

68
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,759
(Resume of Long Mengli)
He didn't look like a good person.

69
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,025
(Education doesn't meet
the requirements. Eliminated.)

70
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,639
Could you have

71
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,519
had debts?

72
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,920
Was he the creditor?

73
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:25,959
Boss.

74
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:28,160
I have to take leave.

75
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:30,480
I'll put you in charge for now.

76
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,198
This girl is arrogant.

77
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:35,999
Am I the boss

78
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,920
or are you the boss?

79
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,278
What?

80
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,199
Why are you back?

81
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,638
Can I get my salary

82
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:42,399
in advance?

83
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:44,480
No way.

84
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:52,480
Well.

85
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,680
Alright.

86
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:54,559
Then,

87
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,600
I'll transfer it to you on my phone.

88
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:57,319
Is 500 yuan enough?

89
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,839
Thank you.

90
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:02,319
Oh my.

91
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,519
What are you doing?

92
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:15,800
Your Highness?

93
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:23,519
Hey.

94
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:28,959
You again?

95
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:31,159
Do you think you have free access here?

96
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,199
Leave.

97
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,920
Let go!

98
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:39,439
Can I go in now?

99
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,759
Sure.

100
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,599
Hello.

101
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,398
Daddy.

102
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,559
(LK Designer, Lin Miaomiao)
I'm here.

103
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,079
(LK Designer, Lin Miaomiao)
It's just an interview.

104
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,715
(LK Designer, Lin Miaomiao)
I'm the top student

105
00:05:54,715 --> 00:05:55,800
at Barov School of Design after all.

106
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:57,278
What?

107
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:59,120
You even contacted Mr. Du?

108
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,518
That was unnecessary.

109
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:01,399
Alright.

110
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,239
What's wrong with you?

111
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,278
I'm sorry.

112
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:05,119
Are you blind?

113
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,878
You dirtied my clothes.

114
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:06,878
I didn't mean it.

115
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:07,560
Or...

116
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,480
How about I make it up to you?

117
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:10,878
Make it up for me?

118
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:11,438
Yes.

119
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:12,360
How?

120
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,680
What a pauper.

121
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,518
Why are you scolding me?

122
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:17,560
Why wouldn't I?

123
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:19,160
I'll even hit you.

124
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,839
Who are you?

125
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,199
How dare you interfere in my affairs?

126
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,439
Do you know who my father...

127
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,759
You're oppressing others.

128
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:29,199
People like you

129
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,639
should be slapped.

130
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,240
Slap...

131
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,720
Slap?

132
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:38,040
Forget it.

133
00:06:38,358 --> 00:06:40,358
I'm at fault in this matter as well.

134
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,239
I'm willing to pay

135
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,079
for the dry cleaning.

136
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:44,639
Who cares?

137
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:45,959
It's decided.

138
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,679
My name is Liu Mei.

139
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,479
What's your name?

140
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,279
My name is Long Mengli.

141
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:51,839
I'm applying for the position
of fashion designer.

142
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,040
Long Mengli.

143
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,160
Just wait and see.

144
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:57,040
Ms. Lin.

145
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,160
What happened?

146
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,360
None of your business!

147
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:01,759
You're annoying.

148
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:04,278
Mengli.

149
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:05,638
I noticed that when you talk,

150
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:07,920
you make people feel awe and surrender.

151
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:09,079
I'm envious.

152
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:10,720
There's nothing to be envious of.

153
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,480
Oh, it hasn't even started.

154
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,600
They must be waiting for Director Qian.

155
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:15,719

156
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,639
