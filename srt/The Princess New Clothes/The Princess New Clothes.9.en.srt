11
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:42,380
Leave it here.

12
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:43,220
Let me do it.

13
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:44,100
You may leave.

14
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:45,340
Just leave it here.

15
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:46,100
You may leave.

16
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:47,820
Mrs. Bai, please have some tea.

17
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:49,860
Young Master Bai.

18
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:50,620
Have some tea.

19
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:54,340
We'll serve ourselves.

20
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,420
Have some tea.

21
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,740
Go ahead.

22
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:01,460
Have some tea.

23
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:03,660
Oh.

24
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:07,660
Gosh.

25
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:08,980
Young Master Bai

26
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,620
is truly good-looking

27
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,820
and talented.

28
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:14,100
Well.

29
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:14,940
Young Master Bai,

30
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,660
have we met somewhere before?

31
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,220
You look familiar.

32
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:19,100
You're mistaken.

33
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:19,900
Well.

34
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,060
That means we feel like
old friends at first meeting.

35
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,740
This must be fate.

36
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:27,060
Young Master Bai,

37
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,860
regarding the investment you said
on the phone...

38
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:31,100
We can talk about that in the future.

39
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,180
We're still discussing it.

40
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:33,300
Okay.

41
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:33,660
Sure.

42
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,380
No problem.

43
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:36,500
So,

44
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:37,460
Mr. Du,

45
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,380
your daughter
is an outstanding individual.

46
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,020
I'm sure she has plenty of admirers.

47
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:43,820
Goodness me.

48
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:44,580
Mrs. Bai,

49
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:45,700
to be honest,

50
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,380
Anqi is obedient and cute.

51
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:49,620
She has never

52
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,020
gotten into a relationship even now.

53
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:53,940
Am I right, my daughter?

54
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:54,860
Huh?

55
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,900
Yes, Mrs. Bai.

56
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,460
I don't have a boyfriend yet.

57
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,020
I see.

58
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,380
After the meal,

59
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,900
I'll let Bai Yu take you out
for a stroll.

60
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,620
Youngsters should spend more time

61
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,340
together.

62
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,340
Only then can you
develop feelings for each other.

63
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:11,380
Grandmother,

64
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:12,900
I have another meeting to attend later.

65
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:13,700
I'll make a move first.

66
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:14,700
You guys can go ahead.

67
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,220
Hey!

68
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:18,580
Mrs. Bai,

69
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,940
may I know where the washroom is?

70
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,660
I'll ask my servant to bring you there.

71
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:23,380
It's fine.

72
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,060
No need for the trouble.

73
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:24,780
I can get there myself.

74
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,340
Just head to the end of the corridor
and turn left.

75
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,940
You see,

76
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,580
youngsters nowadays are quite busy.

77
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,740
They're just busy.

78
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,420
Mrs. Bai,

79
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,060
here.

80
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,060
Have a banana.

81
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:35,780
Here you go.

82
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,260
Have this.

83
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:36,700
Don't stand on ceremony.

84
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,140
Eat up.

85
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:37,580
Here.

86
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,100
Take it.

87
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,060
You should have it.

88
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,380
Mind you, this is my home.

89
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,020
Oh.

90
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,020
I was confused for a second there.

91
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,220
Lu Qi,

92
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,740
I finally found you.

93
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,380
Hurry and follow me to the meeting room.

94
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,140
Mengli is...

95
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,140
What's wrong with Her Highness?

96
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:56,980
Just cut the crap!

97
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:57,940
Let's go.

98
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:00,860
What?

99
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:02,940
"Her Highness"?

100
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:07,940
Young Master Bai, please wait.

101
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,140
Do you need anything?

102
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,060
I could tell

103
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,740
that you didn't want to attend
the blind date either.

104
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,140
Why don't we

105
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,620
find a chance and escape together?

106
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:22,860
Hello?

107
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,180
Lu Qi?

108
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:26,980
I'll head there immediately.

109
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:27,900
Hey!

110
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,860
What do you want?

111
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,260
It's hard to get a cab here.

112
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:32,980
May I hitch a ride?

113
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:33,700
No.

114
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:34,580
Fine.

115
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,260
I'll head back and tell Grandmother
what's going on.

116
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,940
By then, you'll...

117
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:39,540
Come on.

118
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,700
Although this sounds pretty arrogant,

119
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,820
people like us who were born
into wealthy families

120
00:03:58,820 --> 00:03:59,820
are quite tragic.

121
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,660
Not only do we not get to decide

122
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,020
our own marriage,

123
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,620
but we also can't decide our own career.

124
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,780
I'm passionate about acting.

125
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:09,940
But my father

126
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,260
just had to drag me to LK Group

127
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,460
and make me a figurehead vice president.

128
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:13,940
LK?

129
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,140
Miss Du Anqi.

130
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:17,740
Yes?

131
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:20,020
Are you interested in
making a deal with me?

132
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,100
What?

133
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,100
You were framed for plagiarism too?

134
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:25,500
Don't tell me it was the work

135
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,380
of that scoundrel Qian Cheng again.

136
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,900
Master Niu Qiang, do you know him?

137
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:30,580
Li,

138
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,460
can you please don't
refer to me as Master?

139
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:33,420
You make me

140
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,340
sound like

141
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,620
an old monk who's going to die soon.

142
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,540
You can call me Boss,

143
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,380
just like what you did in the past.

144
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,100
However,

145
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,180
why did you say "again"?

146
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,220
Don't tell me he was the reason
why you left the design industry.

147
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,340
That scoundrel

148
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,500
was my junior.

149
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,220
Nonsense!

150
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,940
Were you the one who leaked our drafts
to our competitors?

151
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,300
Now, they're pressing charges against us
for plagiarism.

152
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,500
We're doomed!

153
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,540
Senior,

154
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,540
you mustn't malign me like that.

155
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,780
You're the legal person of the company.

156
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,514
Every contract
had to go through your review

157
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:07,540
before they were approved.

158
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,620
I'm just an assistant. I know nothing.

159
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:11,900
You rogue!

160
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,660
Did you think you would make it

161
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,620
to where you are without me?

162
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,780
Why are you doing this to me?

163
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,140
I'm sorry.

164
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,540
I didn't mean to do this.

165
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:26,660
It's just that the offer they gave me
was too lucrative to refuse.

166
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,340
I will regret it my entire life

167
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,260
if I don't take it.

168
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:33,540
Scram!

169
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:50,460
Alas.

170
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,620
I didn't know any better back then.

171
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,300
I trusted him.

172
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,020
I see.

173
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,420
It's no wonder Director Qian
didn't listen to my explanation.

174
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,180
He was sure that I plagiarized them.

175
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,220
Looks like he's related
to this incident.

176
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,620
I'm 100% sure it's his doing.

177
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,860
That leopard can never change its spots.

178
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:07,740
Your Highness,

179
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,300
I was late in protecting you.

180
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,500
I deserve to die.

181
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,460
What on earth is this?

182
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,100
"I was late in protecting you"?

183
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:15,980
"I deserve to die"?

184
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,820
That sounds so awkward.

185
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:22,620
You see,

186
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,380
we are accustomed to role-playing
in our daily lives.

187
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:26,700
Boss, please don't misunderstand us.

188
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,060
Youngsters like you
know how to have fun indeed.

189
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,620
Geez.

190
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,540
That was so mushy.

191
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:40,740
Qi,

192
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:41,540
who is she?

193
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:42,740
Is she your girlfriend?

194
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:43,820
No.

195
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,580
Liu Mei said she needed to look for Mengli
for something important.

196
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,700
That's why I bring her here.

197
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:47,980
Good.

198
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,180
Don't forget,
you already have a girlfriend.

199
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,140
You're not allowed to have an affair.

200
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,140
Since when did I...

201
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,340
You still owe me a favor, you know?

202
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,060
You want to play tricks now?

203
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:57,740
Enough.

204
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,460
Let's hear Liu Mei out first.

205
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:02,780
Mengli,

206
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:06,740
actually, Lin Miaomiao
and Director Qian are a couple.

207
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,700
They warned me

208
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,860
not to tell anyone about it.

209
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,260
If not, they'd fire me.

210
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,340
I knew it. The two were colluding
with each other.

211
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:14,620
Mengli,

212
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:18,260
one of my friends
is one of the executives at LK Company.

213
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,900
Maybe she can help us out.

214
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,060
Now,

215
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,460
our only choice is to expose
Lin Miaomiao's trickery entirely.

216
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,700
If not, I won't be able to establish
a foothold in the design industry

217
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,460
even with your friend's help.

218
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,860
Why don't I check
the surveillance footage?

219
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:34,580
Since he's daring enough to do it,

220
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,820
I assume he won't let us
get the goods over him.

221
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,300
So,

222
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,620
will a patent work?

223
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,940
A fall into the pit, a gain in your wit.

224
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,260
I had nothing to do anyway.

225
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,900
That's why I helped Li
to apply for a patent.

226
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,140
Of course, it does.

227
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,940
Boss, you've done us
a huge favor this time.

228
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,100
Qi,

229
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,660
you owe me another favor now.

230
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,060
