Mengli.

13
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,460
Also, as a director,

14
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:45,260
Director Qian came to apologize to you
in person.

15
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:45,700
Fine.

16
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:47,980
I accept your apology,

17
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:49,940
but the design of men's clothing

18
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,420
can only be in charge by myself,

19
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,340
and no one else can intervene.

20
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:54,980
Fine.

21
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:55,780
Not a problem.

22
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,460
I will talk to Mr. Du.

23
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,180
Mengli,

24
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,220
that would be great.

Liu Mei,

26
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:07,380
don't you have other tasks at hand?

27
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:08,340
Well,

28
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:08,860
yes.

29
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,780
Then I'll get back to work.

30
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,340
I'll leave you both

31
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,540

Mengli,

33
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,980
thank you for forgiving me.

34
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,940
Allow me to give you a sincere hug,

35
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:34,620
will you?

36
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,020
There's no need for that.

37
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:38,540
Director Qian,

38
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:39,900
if there's nothing else,

39
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,020
you may leave.

40
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,660
It seems that you still haven't accepted
my apology.

41
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,620
Can't you take it

42
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,820
as a superior caring
for his subordinate?

43
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:03,900
Can you leave now?

44
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:09,660
Get some rest.

45
00:02:10,066 --> 00:02:11,186
For the fashion design matter,

46
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,700
I will help you as soon as possible.

47
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,060
Why did you open a convenience store

48
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,860
after leaving the design industry?

49
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,900
This store

50
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,980
was opened by my best friend.

51
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:47,140
She is a poor wretch
who was destroyed by her dreams.

52
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,340
Destroyed by her dreams?

53
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,380

What is a dream?

56
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,060
A dream

57
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,220
is an obsession.

58
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,460
It's a hope to live.

00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,860
In the dreamland,

60
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,740
