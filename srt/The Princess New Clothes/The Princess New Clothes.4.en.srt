00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,079
Li,

12
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,277
who's the hunky guy

13
00:00:57,277 --> 00:00:59,119
who came to deliver something to you
that day?

14
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:00,159
What's your relationship?

15
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,320
Hunky guy?

16
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,560
You know,

17
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,840
he's tall,

18
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,920
muscular,

19
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:07,640
and cute.

20
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:09,200
Well.

21
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,799
You mean Lu Qi?

22
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:11,280
Yes.

23
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:13,359
He's my friend.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,719
You want to see me?

25
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,959
What brings you here?

26
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,840
Just give me a second.

27
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,640
I've got some work
to finish up over there.

28
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,719
We can leave after that.

29
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:37,959
Have you seen enough?

30
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,239
Take me to the storage room.

31
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,280
Okay,

32
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:41,239
this way.

33
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,920
How did you two know each other?

34
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:46,200
You have no idea.

35
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,599
It's a long story.

36
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:48,359
Look,

37
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,879
I brought you soup.

38
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:50,439
Let's go.

39
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,799
I made it the way
the old cook at your residence

40
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,200
used to make it.

41
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,680
Try it

42
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,640
and see if it tastes right.

43
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,000
Yeah,

44
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:07,359
it's good.

45
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:11,919
But did you leave out
the polygonatum odoratum?

46
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:15,439
You're indeed well-versed in medicine,
the Third Princess of Northern Liang.

47
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,719
You can even tell

48
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,159
it's missing an ingredient.

49
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,719
Actually, this soup

50
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,200
was created by my mother
when she was alive.

51
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,080
After she left,

52
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,400
it took me over ten years

53
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,120
to gather all the ingredients

54
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,759
to make this soup.

55
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,840
Of course, I remember
the taste of it very well.

56
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:34,840
By the way.

57
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,680
I've got good news for you.

58
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,039
I saw this at work today.

59
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,520
LK New Designer Competition.

60
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:46,159
No age or education restrictions?

61
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,599
Premium work wins the day.

62
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,639
Bai Yu,

63
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,000
you're a godsend to me.

64
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,960
You're the one who's lucky.

65
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,439
Everything turns out well for you.

66
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,902
But the requirement of this
is to participate

67
00:03:05,902 --> 00:03:06,919
with a ready-made garment.

68
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:08,960
We don't have sewing equipment

69
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,560
or a place to work,

70
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:12,599
so what can we do?

71
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:16,120
I have a place

72
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,919
to make garments.

73
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,840
You do?

74
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:21,120
But next time, can you talk in private

75
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,800
without walking so far away?

76
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:33,599
I used to be

77
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:35,360
a designer too.

78
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:36,759
I didn't expect

79
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:39,439
these things to come in handy one day.

80
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:05,120
Director Qian.

81
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:05,879
Yes?

82
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:07,586
Lin Miaomiao,
a newcomer to the design department,

83
00:04:07,587 --> 00:04:08,520
is here to report to you.

84
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,199
Did you miss me?

85
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:15,719
I think about you

86
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,920
all day and night.

87
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,279
I don't believe it.

88
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:20,680
Baby,

89
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,600
I will

90
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,839
prove it to you now.

91
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,720
Director Qian.

92
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,199
Who let you in?

93
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,160
Where's Qiqi?

94
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,720
I'm sorry, Director Qian.

95
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,879
Well, Qiqi

96
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:35,040
has been transferred
to another department.

97
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,199
I'm here to deliver
the competition sign-up sheets.

98
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,120
Leave them here.

99
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,000
(Application form of the competition)
(Long Mengli.)

100
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:47,279
Don't worry.

101
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:48,319
She won't say anything about us.

102
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,480
If there's nothing else,

103
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:51,160
well,

104
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,040
you can go out now.

105
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,560
Alright.

106
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:54,199
I...

107
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,160
I'll get going then.

108
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:01,480
Okay.

109
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,000
If you want to see me...

110
00:05:13,075 --> 00:05:13,900
(Venue of LK New Designer Competition)

111
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:16,720

(She didn't make it
through the primary?)

114
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:36,199
You're new here, aren't you?

115
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:37,959
Yes.

116
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:40,360
You should be out there patrolling.

117
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,399
Why are you slacking off here?

118
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,360
Do you even know the rules?

119
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,480
