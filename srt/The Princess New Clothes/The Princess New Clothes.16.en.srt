12
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:42,820
Mengli,

13
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:44,540
after tonight,

14
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,420
you and I
will be the rulers of this land.

15
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,900
We'll enjoy peace and prosperity,

16
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,140
and be remembered
for generations to come.

17
00:00:50,898 --> 00:00:51,860
It doesn't matter

18
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,780
if we're remembered
for generations in history.

19
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:54,500
I just hope

20
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,020
you can be a good emperor.

21
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,220
Don't worry.

22
00:00:58,780 --> 00:00:59,420
Remember

23
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:00,580
to execute the Empress,

24
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,700
the Second Prince and their cohorts,

25
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:03,820
leaving no one alive.

26
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:07,860
Be careful.

27
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,580
Why do you have to kill everyone?

28
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:11,820
You can just banish them.

29
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:12,780
Mengli,

30
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:14,900
don't you want to avenge
your mother's death?

31
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:17,020
I heard

32
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,220
that the Empress
was the one who poisoned

33
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:20,540
your mother.

34
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,420
It was her?

35
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:29,820
Later, I found out

36
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,180
that my mother's death
had nothing to do with the Empress.

37
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:40,620
It's all a ploy by the Fifth Prince
to use me to kill them.

38
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:42,780
Mengli,

39
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,420
I'm Bai Yu.

40
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:47,820
Try to believe me once more.

41
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:50,980
Just once, okay?

42
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:57,900
Really?

43
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,140
Yes.

44
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:08,660

Still no clue?

55
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,620
That's weird.

56
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,740
What's wrong with it?

57
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,860
Are you in too much of a hurry

58
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,340
that you've overlooked
the most basic things?

59
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,860
What?

60
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:08,300
Mengli,

61
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:09,980
do you remember what happened

62
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,340
before everyone in your residence
was wiped out?

63
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,180
I remember

64
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,860
that was when I first learned

65
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,820
that His Majesty wanted
to get rid of everyone around me.

66
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:24,420
Bai Yu,

67
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,460
take your men
and get out of my residence,

68
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:27,860
and don't ever come back!

69
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:28,660
I dare not

70
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,300
disobey your orders.

71
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,820
I just want you to tell me

72
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,260
what I've done wrong.

73
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,660
Are you questioning me?

74
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:35,780
I dare not.

75
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,260
I've long been displeased with you.

76
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,740
You've been pestering me shamelessly
like a dog

77
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:40,580
for the past three years,

78
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,580
and I can't get rid of you.

79
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,220
It's really annoying.

80
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,220
Your Highness,

81
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,500
you've gone too far.

82
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:46,420
Young Master has treated you...

83
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,100
Lu Qi,

84
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,100
shut up!

85
00:03:51,893 --> 00:03:53,013
In that case,

86
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,620
I'll leave immediately, Your Highness.

87
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,300
I'm sorry,

88
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:18,420
Bai Yu.

89
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:27,740
I'm sorry.

90
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,020
I was...

91
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,620
I was just desperate

92
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,660
to keep you out of it.

93
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,500
So I...

94
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:34,860
Did it ever occur to you

95
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,180
that I wouldn't be able
to stay out of this

96
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,020
after I found out the truth?

97
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,820
You might as well come clean,

98
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,860
and we'd fight
with everything we've got.

99
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,100
But I can't risk your life.

100
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,900
At that point,

101
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,700
you were already important to me.

102
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,100
If that's the case,

103
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,500
it's all the more reason for us
to trust each other

104
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,060
instead of pushing the other person away

105
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,020
to protect him or her.

106
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,180
Okay.

107
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,380
I'm sorry, okay?

108
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,380
But what's that got to do
with the design?

109
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,940
You're designing men's clothing.

110
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,500
So why don't you

111
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,180
put yourself in the shoes
of those who wear it

112
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,500
and think about their feelings?

113
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,460
I see.

114
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,820
I got it.

115
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,580
I've been

116
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,220
at your beck and call all day.

117
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,060
This should be considered an apology.

118
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,060
So you're apologizing?

119
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,420
I didn't know.

120
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:58,740
Wait,

121
00:05:58,740 --> 00:05:59,660
what did you say?

122
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:01,780
Yes.

123
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:02,700
Of course, it's an apology.

124
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,060
You've made such a big concession,

125
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,460
so you'll be the head of the family
from now on.

126
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,260
Of course.

127
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,580
What are you doing?

128
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,260
I'm carrying you back home

129
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,540
in my arms.

130
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,620
Good boy.

131
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:22,940
I allow it.

132
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:24,780
Let's go home.

133
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,140
Okay.

134
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,660
It's a deal, then.

135
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,420
When it's done,

136
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,260
I'll transfer the money to your account.
