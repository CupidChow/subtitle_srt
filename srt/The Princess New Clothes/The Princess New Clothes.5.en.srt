00:00:40,725 --> 00:00:43,020
(Venue of LK New Designer Competition)

12
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:43,560
Well,

13
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,719
I hereby announce

14
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:47,880
that Long Mengli
and all participants with an A

15
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,679
get to join the Spring Special Team

16
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:52,479
led by Director Qian himself.

17
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:54,079
Come on.

18
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:54,600
Guys,

19
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,679
applause.

20
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:01,399
Congratulations.

21
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,079
I am looking forward to working with you
in the future.

22
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,280
It's a great surprise
to find such talent

23
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:17,280
among the newbies.

24
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:31,959
Bai Yu,

25
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,200
are you freaking out?

26
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,200
Do you need me to give you a hand?

27
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:45,319
Mengli.

28
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:46,280
Fifth Brother,

29
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,799
what brings you here?

30
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:50,480
Are you alright?

31
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,159
Did you just come back
from studying abroad?

32
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,719
(To welcome
the new colleagues' arrival,)

33
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,719
I propose going out for dinner

34
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:18,520
after work today.

35
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,319
Is that okay?

36
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,319
That's a good idea.

37
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,520
I'll treat you all to hotpot.

38
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,280
Wow, great.

39
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,000
That's great.

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,400
Hey,

41
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:23,919
Mengli,

42
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:24,719
let's go together.

43
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm not going.

44
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,280
I've got work to do.

45
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,479
Come on, Mengli.

46
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:29,439
Why don't you join us?

47
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:30,639
Or it'll be a real bummer.

48
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,879
I really can't make it this time.

49
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:35,639
Long Mengli,

50
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:37,639
what are you so proud of?

51
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,680
You're being disrespectful.

52
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,360
Don't think you're a big shot

53
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,199
just because you made a splash
at the showcase.

54
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,080
Do you dare to make a bet with me?

55
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:58,800
What's the bet?

56
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:01,280
Let's bet on

57
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:03,520
whose spring design

58
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,520
will win.

59
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:07,319
The loser

60
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:08,439
will resign

61
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:09,960
and get out of the company.

62
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:13,919
Are you sure about this?

63
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:14,800
You're scared, aren't you?

64
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,039
But I'm

65
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:19,319
a magnanimous person.

66
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:21,840
I'll let it slide if you apologize

67
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,560
and admit you're wrong.

68
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:27,599
It's a deal.

69
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:29,560
We'll bet on it.

70
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,439
So, are we still having dinner together?

71
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:41,840
You wish!

72
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,319
Don't forget

73
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:12,400
that I was the one
who taught you martial arts.

74
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,240
Your Highness, you're amazing.

75
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,399
I give in.

76
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:24,519
Where have you been

77
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:26,040
these days?

78
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,639
I thought

79
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,800
you didn't want to see me.

80
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,279
Who said that?

81
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,240
These days, I've been very...

82
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,199
What I mean is that

83
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,079
you are the closest person to me

84
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:43,680
in this world.

85
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,079
So we should be there for each other.

86
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:50,240
Your Highness,

87
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,800
Director Qian

88
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:57,000
looks very similar to the Fifth Prince.

89
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,319
I think you've noticed that.

90
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,000
Sorry, I spoke out of turn.

91
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,079
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

92
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Get up.

93
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Don't let anyone see this.

94
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:08,079
Besides,

95
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:10,920
don't ever

96
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,800
mention that person's name

97
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,279
in front of me again.

98
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,040
Yes.

99
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,759
Whether or not I go back
to Northern Liang,

100
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,519
I won't have anything to do

101
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:22,160
with that person again.

102
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,120
I've already disregarded

103
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,600
such a treacherous

104
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,399
and untrustworthy person
without any regret.

105
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,399
Your Highness,

106
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:33,319
actually...

107
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:35,240
There's one more important thing
right now.

108
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:35,959
What's it?

109
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,560
Get up first.

110
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:43,759
The bet with Lin Miaomiao.

111
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:47,959
Your Highness,

112
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:50,199
there's someone
who can definitely help you.

113
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:53,120
What?

114
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,319
You want me to be your teacher?

115
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:55,279
Are you kidding me?

116
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:55,879
Niu Qiang.

117
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:56,639
Your real name is Liu Qiang.

118
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,000
You're the gold medalist

119
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,079
of the 23rd National Fashion
Designer Competition,

120
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:00,160
known as a rare talent.

121
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,160
You disappeared three years ago.

122
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:01,800
There's no trace back.

123
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,319
Awesome.

124
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:05,040
As you can even get to the bottom

125
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,079
of these long-ago stories,

126
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,199
you're really Qi who I admire.

127
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:08,360
Amazing.

128
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,480
In the hustle and bustle of the city,

129
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,439
I didn't expect you
to be an extraordinary person.

130
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,319
Extraordinary person?

131
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:14,800
I was just forced
to change my profession

132
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,000
because I couldn't stay
in the industry any longer.

133
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:17,800
Why?

134
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:18,920
Alas,

135
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,160
I don't want to talk about it.

136
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:21,360
Anyway,

137
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:23,160
I can't help you
because I've been out of the industry

138
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,160
for many years.

139
00:06:26,957 --> 00:06:27,800
Go.

140
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,639
Boss,

141
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,720
can you do me a favor?

142
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,399
So you

143
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:50,959
will owe me a favor?

144
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:52,879
And I can do whatever I want to you?

145
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,519
Alas.

146
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,399
Yes.

147
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,839
I was just teasing you.

148
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:01,480
You're so cool,

149
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,399
how dare I do that?

150
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:04,240
But I'll

151
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:05,560
do you this favor.

152
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,199
Li,

153
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,680
these

154
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,680
are the books of secrets
that I've been keeping for years.

155
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:15,560
The Nine Yin Manual and Kuihua Handbook
of the fashion design world,

they're

all yours.

158
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,360
It's up to you

159
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,240
