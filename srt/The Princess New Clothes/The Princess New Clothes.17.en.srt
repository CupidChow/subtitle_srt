=Episode 17=

11
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,180
What?

12
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,180
You want the three of us to be models?

13
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:46,460
How can that be?

14
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:47,740
Okay,

15
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:49,020
I'll do whatever you want.

16
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,180
I'll do what you say, Young Master.

17
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:57,860
Even if you can find models,

18
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:59,820
what about the main outfits?

19
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:01,940
(Thanks for the applause.)

20
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,420
As you can see,

21
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,900
the Italian brand, SC,
has already gotten

22
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,700
much attention and interest.

23
00:01:07,989 --> 00:01:10,709
So, what will the domestic brand, LK,

24
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,300
bring to us next?

25
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:16,220
Let's welcome them
with a round of applause.

26
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,260
What's going on?

27
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,060
Didn't they

28
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,460
have it all arranged?

29
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,020
There are no models or clothing.

30
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:33,460
She's not Sun Wukong,

31
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,620
what can she do?

32
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,900
Are we doomed?

33
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,020
What to do?

34
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,060
It's so embarrassing.

35
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,180
Will this affect
the entire design department?

36
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,260
Oh, no.

37
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:43,420
Wait.

38
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,060
Look, here they are.

39
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,140
This is...

40
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,820
Well, what's going on?

41
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,700
Qian Cheng is a very cunning man.

42
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,380
He can't be nice to me for no reason.

43
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,660
I knew he was up to something.

44
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,580
So I've prepared
the most important things

45
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:35,620
in advance.

46
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,980
Dad, look.

47
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,420
Not bad.

48
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,300
What's going on here?

49
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,500
Why is Bai Yu on stage?

50
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:16,780
Mrs. Bai,

51
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,460
don't leave yet.

52
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,100
Mengli!

53
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:43,700
Mengli!

54
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:47,940
Mengli!

55
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,180
Mengli.

56
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,140
There's good news.

57
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,700
The Dreaming Back to Northern Liang series
is on the trending now.

58
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,980
Everyone loves your designs so much.

59
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,460
Wow,

60
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,980
there's no end to the compliments.

61
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:06,260
Mengli, you've made a name
for yourself.

62
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:07,540
There are even some people who want

63
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,980
the designer and
the model to be together.

64
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,100
Do they judge people or clothing?

65
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,740
And there's a lot of speculation
about the identity of the male model.

66
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:14,820
Will his identity

67
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:15,860
be checked out?

68
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,060
Mengli,

69
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,420
I've heard that Mr. Du
has submitted this series of designs

70
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,540
to the board of directors
as LK's main collection

71
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,660
for the second half of the year.

72
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,580
If it's approved,

73
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,060
Mengli will be

74
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,820
the chief designer on par

75
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,260
with Director Qian.

76
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,420
Wow!

77
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:36,580
I'm sorry.

78
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:37,860
I was careless this time.

79
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,380
I promise this won't happen again.

80
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:41,820
Fine.

81
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,500
However,

82
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:47,060
Long Mengli is close to
the Bai family's young master.

83
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,780
We have to be careful.

84
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,540
Don't worry about this.

85
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:52,900
I already have a plan.

86
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:54,740
Okay.

87
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,260
We've worked together so many times,

88
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,220
of course, I trust you.

89
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,260
You'll be the general manager of LK

90
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,940
if you bring down Mr. Du.

91
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,060
Hello,

92
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:14,860
Reporter Li?

93
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,260
Have you seen today's trending?

94
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,220
Now

95
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,940
is the perfect time to break the news.

96
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:21,580
Don't worry.

97
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,420
I'll arrange for someone

98
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,140
from the Fashion Design Association
to work with you.

99
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:25,580
Besides,

100
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,660
send someone to Long Mengli's hometown.

101
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,740
