=Episode 7=

11
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:42,599
Bai Yu,

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,718
you're really smart.

13
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:45,639
You immediately understood
my intention that day

14
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,078
and brought people to see Qian
make a fool of himself.

15
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:48,358
You're more than capable

16
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:50,039
of dealing with him.

17
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,199
You must have had other plans in mind

18
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,479
when you contacted me.

19
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:54,478
Qian Cheng is lecherous and bold.

20
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:56,399
He's by no means a good person.

21
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,478
He won't let it slide

22
00:00:58,479 --> 00:00:59,158
after

23
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,960
he's suffered this.

24
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:03,479
Your Highness, don't worry.

25
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:04,719
I'm here for you.

26
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,920
Since when have you been
so disrespectful to me?

27
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:17,799
What?

28
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,680
Get on your knees.

29
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,119
To me, these dirty tricks

30
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,280
are just child's play.

31
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,200
Back then, there was even
more trickery in the imperial court.

32
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:34,798
How would I

33
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,760
care about his dirty tricks?

34
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,238
Hey, Liu Mei.

35
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:39,679
I dare you to bet

36
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,358
that Long Mengli

37
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:42,599
and Director Qian are having an affair.

38
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:43,639
Don't say that.

39
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,559
Mengli is not that kind of person.

40
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,718
Don't judge a book by its cover.

41
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:47,119
Keep your voice down.

42
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,999
I'm sorry, ladies.

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You can't go in there.

44
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:50,479
This room is temporarily closed

45
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,518
due to electrical problems.

46
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:53,399
Why don't you two go somewhere else?

47
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,279
What?

48
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,159
Okay.

49
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:58,279
(Miaomiao,)

50
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,438
you've got it wrong.

51
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:00,598
I don't have anything to do

52
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:01,799
with Long Mengli.

53
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,000
Humph.

54
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:05,280
But what happened that day
was so strange.

55
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,639
I don't believe you're practicing
some kind of self-defense

56
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,639
in your office.

57
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:09,918
Besides,

58
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,280
why haven't you
disclosed our relationship?

59
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:14,478
It's for your own good.

60
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:16,400
You want to get blamed by everyone?

61
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,080
Hmm?

62
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,359
To be honest,

63
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,080
Long Mengli tried to seduce me.

64
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,559
She wanted me to give her high scores

65
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,400
in the competition.

66
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,799
What a shameless woman.

67
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,638
So you...

68
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:30,198
Of course, I didn't say yes to her.

69
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,239
That's why she got angry

70
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,279
and hit me.

71
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,120
Look at the bruise.

72
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:37,479
She's gone too far.

73
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,239
What are you waiting for?

74
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,599
Just fire her.

75
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,438
I can't do that.

76
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:43,399
She was recruited

77
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,319
by Mr. Du himself.

78
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:46,960
We can't accuse her

79
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,800
without evidence.

80
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:52,919
Looks like

81
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:55,639
the only way is to beat her.

82
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:58,478
But it's not like you're in charge

83
00:02:58,479 --> 00:02:59,959
of the competition.

84
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,800
What if...

85
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,199
I've got a way to beat her.

86
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:13,159
Is this going to work?

87
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,919
Believe me.

88
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,800
Gosh,

89
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,840
the new uniform makes me look good.

90
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,439
Do I have to change my hairstyle?

91
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,840
Hey,

92
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,679
who are you?

93
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,559
You can't enter without an ID badge.

94
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:31,799
No.

95
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,360
Leave now.

96
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:33,478
I'm looking for Long Mengli.

97
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,519
Long Mengli is my daughter.

98
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,438
It's an emergency.

99
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:36,198
You can't get in to look for anyone.

100
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:36,918
Leave now.

101
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:37,279
Hey.

102
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,079
You can't enter without an ID badge.

103
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,519
Leave now.

104
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,039
No.

105
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,119
Hey, Long Mengli!

106
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,799
Come out!

107
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,478
Let go of me!

108
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:42,519
Who do you think you are?

109
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,239
You're just a security guard.

110
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,318
Security guard?

111
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:46,559
Believe it or not, I'll beat you up.

112
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,039
Let go of me!

113
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:49,800
Ms. Lin.

114
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,599
This is my friend.

115
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:53,680
What?

116
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:55,599
Go ahead and get busy.

117
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,120
I'll take care of this.

118
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:00,000
Alright.

119
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:02,459
(Long Mengli's Father)

120
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,758
(Long Mengli's Father)
Who are you?

121
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:05,680
I'm Mengli's colleague.

122
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:07,080
Please come with me.

123
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,039
Long Mengli,

124
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,519
look who's here.

125
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,720
How come it's only this much,

126
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:46,398
huh?

127
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:47,159
I...

128
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,079
I have to buy some textbooks this month.

129
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:49,920
I have to...

130
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:53,199
Give it to me.

131
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:56,879
I've worked so hard to raise you,

132
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:59,119
you should earn money
to fulfill my needs,

133
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,079
you know?

134
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,319
Take it.

135
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:12,519
(Third Princess,)

136
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,360
(I envied other people
for having a good father,)

137
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,360
(I envied other people
for being together as a family,)

138
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,920
(but I)

139
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,160
(couldn't do anything about it.)

140
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,920
Mengli.

141
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,600
What brings you here?

142
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:35,040
Your father came all the way
from the village to see you.

143
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:37,879
What an enviable love

144
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:39,319
between father and daughter.

145
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:41,878
Yeah,

146
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:42,639
Mengli.

147
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:43,958
Wow,

148
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:44,800
I can't believe

149
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,160
you work for such a high-class company.

150
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,719
I'm so happy for you.

151
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,240
Mr. Long, answer me.

152
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:51,719
What brings you here?

153
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,160
Wait.

154
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,638
What did you call me?

155
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:54,639
Mr. Long?

156
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:56,839
Well.

157
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,120
You're worried

158
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,079
that it's inconvenient
to talk here, right?

159
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,999
Then, let's talk outside.

160
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,800
It's alright.

161
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,560
Let's talk here.

162
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:06,839
(She's like a different person.)

163
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,318
Alright,

164
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:10,920
Mengli.

165
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:12,079
Here's the thing.

166
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,559
Our house is in disrepair

167
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,518
and needs to be renovated.

168
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:17,919
I borrowed some money from someone,

169
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,638
but recently they came to our door
to collect the debt.

170
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:21,480
What's it got to do with me?

171
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:22,720
Hey,

172
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:25,240
he's your father, after all.

173
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,879
How can you talk like that?

174
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,559
A person who despises their own parents

175
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,359
is worse than a dog.

176
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,360
Who do you think you are?

177
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:33,518
What do you have to do
with my family affairs?

178
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:33,999
I...

179
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Do not exhort others to do good

180
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,560
without experiencing their suffering.

181
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:38,719
Such a scum doesn't
deserve to be a father,

182
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,318
let alone receive support.

183
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,240
Mengli,

184
00:06:41,566 --> 00:06:43,120
you've gone too far.

185
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:45,559
I raised you so well.

186
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,838
Now you've become successful,

187
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:48,319
and you want to disown me?

188
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:49,799
Do you have a death wish?

189
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,680
Get lost!

190
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:52,360
Or I'll call the police.

191
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:53,759
