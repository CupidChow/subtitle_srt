Mengli,

12
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,438
Director Qian wants you
to go to his office.

13
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:46,719
You've got to be careful.

14
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,879
He seems to know

15
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,799
about the bet you made
with Lin Miaomiao.

16
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,560
I'll be alright.

17
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:27,120
Tell me,

18
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:29,200
why did you crown the legitimate daughter
of Duke Ying as the Empress?

19
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:31,319
Have you forgotten
your promise, Your Majesty?

20
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:33,200
Of course, I remember.

21
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:36,200
But the situation
is completely different now.

22
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:38,359
Only through the prestige of Duke Ying

23
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:40,280
can I get the ministers to submit to me.

24
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,079
For the sake of the country

25
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:44,359
and the people,

26
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,238
I have to bear the pain of losing you.

27
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:49,439

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,879

You've never known me well.

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,120
Alright.

38
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:13,479
Since you won't forgive me,

39
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:17,520
just kill me.

Director Qian, what do you want
to see me about?

55
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:48,360
Long Mengli,

56
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:49,718
has anyone ever told you

57
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:51,519
that you look good in ancient costumes,

58
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,439
that you have

59
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:53,919
a kind of noble sexiness?

60
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:56,119
You didn't call me here

61
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,960
to talk about my attire, right?

62
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,680
Long Mengli,

63
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,839
is there some kind of

64
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,519
misunderstanding between us?

65
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,758
It seems like

66
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:17,079
you have a lot of opinions about me.

67
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,519
No.

68
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,040
It's the best then.

69
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,439
If there is any,

70
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,680
I'll drink this

71
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,639

72
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,599
Let's

73
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,800
work together

74
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,759

75
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:58,680

76
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:00,319

78
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:15,360
I'm suddenly very dizzy.

79
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:16,959
Mengli,

80
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,920
I'll take you to the couch.

81
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,360
Okay.

82
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,160
Can you get me a glass of water?

83
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:33,920
Can you?

84
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,439
Sure.

85
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:44,278
Young Master,

86
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:45,519
you're in a good mood today.

87
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,319
Do your job

88
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:49,600

Qi,

90
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,920

91
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,079
So cool.

92
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:03,600

93

Yu.

94
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:13,639
Director Qian,

95
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,480
don't be like this.

97
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:24,439
if our colleagues see this,

98
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,360
it'll affect your reputation.

99
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:30,040
Mengli,

100
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,560
you're so cute and naive.

101
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:34,239
You've never heard of

102
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,279
the unspoken workplace rules?

103
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:38,239
What are

104
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,719
the unspoken workplace rules?

105
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,600
It's common for newbies
to be suppressed in the workplace.

106
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,878
It's easy to be ostracized

107
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:46,360
when you're so full of character.

108
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,839
Unless

109
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,439
your superior has your back.

110
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:50,920
Or

111
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,680
it will be hard for you
to do your job well.

112
00:06:58,519 --> 00:06:59,560
I got it.

113
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,480
As the saying goes,

114
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:05,279
the higher your rank,

115
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,759
the more you can suppress.

116
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,078
Is that the point?

117
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:11,559
Yes.

118
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,518

Director Qian,

121
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:19,039
The security department
received a report

122
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,240
that a pervert had infiltrated
the design department's office.

123
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:22,639
Are you alright?

124
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:24,920
I'm fine.

125
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,719
What are you doing here?

126
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,680
You don't have to work?

127
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:31,560
Well.

128
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,160
Are you sure

129
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,239
there's no one suspicious here?

130
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,680
No. Not at all.

00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:38,958
Mengli and I...

00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,359
Mengli is good at martial arts.

133
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,758
I was discussing it with her.

134
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:42,078
Right?

135
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,920
Isn't that right, Mengli?

136
00:07:44,016 --> 00:07:44,920
Mengli,

137
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,759
if there's nothing else,

138
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:47,959
