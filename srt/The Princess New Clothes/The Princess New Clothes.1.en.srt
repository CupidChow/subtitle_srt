=Episode 1=

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,118
(Long Mengli, Third Princess of Northern Liang)
Third Princess Long Mengli from Northern Liang

12
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:44,078
claims her martial arts skill
surpasses that of her master.

13
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,038
She seeks to usurp the throne.

14
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:48,158
(Fifth Prince of Northern Liang)
Seeing she once contributed to the nation,

15
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:49,438
she shall face execution

16
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:51,640
by poisoned wine.

17
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,000
Your Majesty.

18
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,279
Have you forgotten

19
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,640
how you secured the throne?

20
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,959
If I wanted to overthrow you,

21
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,920
why would I wait until now?

22
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,674
(Long Mengli,
princess of the fallen dynasty.)

23
00:01:12,675 --> 00:01:15,074
(Adopted by the late emperor
at a young age as his goddaughter,)

24
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,324
(she became the commander
of three armies with her bravery.)

25
00:01:17,325 --> 00:01:18,275
(Princess's Residence)

26
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,718
Your Majesty.

27
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:23,159
It's time to return to the palace.

28
00:01:39,775 --> 00:01:42,675
(Bai Yu, guard of the Third Princess
of Northern Liang)

29
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,879
Mengli!

30
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,000
Mengli!

31
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:02,640
Wake up.

32
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,560
Wake up.

33
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,040
(Who are you?)

34
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:10,039
I am Long Mengli from another world.

35
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,799
I know who you are.

36
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,599
If you want to return to Northern Liang,

37
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,360
you must realize my wish for me.

38
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:19,400
(A wish?)

39
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,319
(What wish?)

40
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:25,800
My wish

41
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:26,879
is...

42
00:02:28,725 --> 00:02:36,438
(Private Clinic)

43
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:37,840
Where am I?

44
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:48,318
It looks like

45
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,718
my face...

46
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:51,199
But something is different.

47
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,800
(Where am I?)

48
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,840
This is my design draft.

49
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,400
Director Qian won't see you.

50
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,478
Boss.

51
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:06,520
I'll be right back.

52
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:10,759
Hurry up.

53
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,360
Go back to your ward and lie down.

54
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,799
You are very fortunate

55
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,280
to have survived it.

56
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:18,119
And there are no serious wounds.

57
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:18,718
All right.

58
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:19,918
Get some good rest.

59
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:20,839
You can get discharged

60
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,879
two days after.

61
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:27,718
(Long Mengli!)

62
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:29,039
(You fool!)

63
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,319
My goodness.

64
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,119
What is this?

65
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,280
A concept ward?

66
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:39,360
Are you role-playing someone?

67
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,759
Insolence!

68
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,680
Who are you to raise your voice here?

69
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:43,718
(Niu Qiang,
owner of a convenience store)

70
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:44,638
You're yelling at me?

71
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:45,599
Do you want to get fired?

72
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,800
How dare you speak to me
with such rudeness!

73
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,240
Li.

74
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,718
Li?

75
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:55,158
What's wrong with you today?

76
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:56,638
The way you talk is so weird.

77
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:58,839
Did that accident hurt your brain?

78
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,359
You feel like a different person.

79
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,038
(Oh my.)

80
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:02,519
(She is not your servant.)

81
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,878
(She is my boss.)

82
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:05,359
(Do not get on her bad side.)

83
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,399
(Until we make it into LK,)

84
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,960
(we need her to survive.)

85
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,800
(Fine. I get it.)

86
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,680
Are you all right?

87
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,040
Li?

88
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,599
Mr. Liu

89
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,799
insisted on having you accompany him
to drink and eat barbecue

90
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,879
before he could supply
more stock to our shop.

91
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:23,920
So...

92
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,240
Is it possible...

93
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,120
I...

94
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,198
I am

95
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:31,480
not feeling well today.

96
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:34,439
We will discuss this another day.

97
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:35,399
Well...

98
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,878
You should rest.

99
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:37,639
Rest well.

100
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,639
(Remember.)

101
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,360
(It's my dream)

102
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,560
to make it into LK

103
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,879
and become an ace fashion designer.

104
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,639
If you want to return to the past,

105
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:59,639
you must fulfill my wish.

106
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:16,720
Mr. Liu could certainly hold his bottle.

107
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,160
A little drinking is nothing for me,
the Princess.

108
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,518
Princess?

109
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:23,159
You really are drunk.

110
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,360
Let's go home.

111
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:30,639
Young Master.

112
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,439
We've searched for
the Third Princess for so long.

113
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:35,919
We can't search for her aimlessly

114
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,920
forever.

115
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:37,878
Not to mention

116
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,959
she might have never arrived
in this era.

117
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,439
