HEARTBEAT

2
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,298
ALL CHARACTERS, NAMES,
ORGANIZATIONS, GROUPS, EVENTS,

3
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,383
AND SETTINGS ARE FICTITIOUS
AND ANIMAL SAFETY GUIDELINES WERE FOLLOWED

4
00:01:00,186 --> 00:01:01,937
I warned you, didn't I?

5
00:01:02,021 --> 00:01:04,648
It's dangerous
to be on the border of two beings.

6
00:01:05,608 --> 00:01:06,734
You're running out of time.

7
00:01:07,443 --> 00:01:10,070
You'll begin to experience
abnormal symptoms like today.

8
00:01:10,154 --> 00:01:11,489
You'll feel worse and worse.

9
00:01:19,455 --> 00:01:20,915
You're saying I'm going to die?

10
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:23,209
But...

11
00:01:24,293 --> 00:01:25,961
I haven't become human yet.

12
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:28,464
So get yourself together
if you don't want to die!

13
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:34,428
You said you want to experience love
that makes your heart beat.

14
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:38,098
You said you want to keep the promise
you made to Hae-sun.

15
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:41,227
So live at all costs.

16
00:01:41,936 --> 00:01:45,898
Brace yourself like when you decided
to spend 100 years in the hawthorn coffin.

17
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:47,024
You must

18
00:01:47,942 --> 00:01:48,943
live.

19
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:56,450
I can't die
without having lived a proper life.

20
00:02:02,081 --> 00:02:03,499
I must survive...

21
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,292
at all costs.

22
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:13,717
I saw it with my own two eyes.

23
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:15,803
He's not human.

24
00:02:26,564 --> 00:02:29,525
Why is he taking so long
to hand out rice cakes?

25
00:02:32,403 --> 00:02:34,738
I'm sure he's slacking off somewhere.

26
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:37,116
He's never any help.

27
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:38,534
I'm going to teach him a lesson.

28
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:44,748
What took you so...

29
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:52,923
Do-sik, you said you were busy.
What brings you here?

30
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:54,550
It's your opening day after all.

31
00:02:55,301 --> 00:02:56,594
It's been on my mind.

32
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:58,971
You didn't have to.

33
00:02:59,722 --> 00:03:00,764
Thank you.

34
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:02,850
Where's Mr. Seon?

35
00:03:03,142 --> 00:03:05,436
He went out to hand out rice cakes
and hasn't been back since.

36
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:10,399
In-hae, can we talk outside for a moment?

37
00:03:15,029 --> 00:03:17,531
What's this about?

38
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,245
I know what I'm about to say

39
00:03:23,913 --> 00:03:26,040
will sound extremely strange.

40
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:28,167
It's about Mr. Seon.

41
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:31,670
What about him?

42
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:34,423
Have you ever noticed
anything strange about him?

43
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:38,928
What do you mean?

44
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:43,933
I saw something odd
the day you invited me over

45
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:45,559
to this mansion.

46
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:50,272
There's no way
anyone can move at that speed.

47
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:51,982
It's been bothering me.

48
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:54,318
Do you know anything?

49
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:56,737
Oh, come on.

50
00:03:57,196 --> 00:03:59,615
Maybe you were seeing things.

51
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:02,409
We all drank quite a lot that day.

52
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:04,787
I don't think
it's something we should laugh off.

53
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:08,207
Do-sik.

54
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,961
I know Woo-hyeol can come off as unusual,

55
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,090
but he's not
as strange as you think he is.

56
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,342
I can vouch for that.

57
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:22,137
- In-hae.
- Don't worry.

58
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:25,474
I know him well enough,

59
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:28,227
so you don't need to worry too much.

60
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:34,775
HEARTBEAT
EPISODE 9

61
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,947
You know him well?

62
00:04:42,116 --> 00:04:44,660
Has it ever occurred to you
that you may not know everything?

63
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:49,748
Everyone has a side
that they'd rather hide.

64
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,293
Don't you?

65
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,354
Humans can't do this.

66
00:05:15,024 --> 00:05:16,358
He's a vampire for sure.

67
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:31,498
You're slacking off
on our first day of business?

68
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,876
I'm sorry.

69
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:38,213
Is something wrong?

70
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:40,966
You don't look well.

71
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:45,971
There's nothing wrong.

72
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:08,786
Did you sleep well?

73
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:10,788
No, I tossed and turned.

74
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:13,082
I'm a light sleeper, you see.

75
00:06:13,499 --> 00:06:14,792
It might be because the house is old,

76
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,502
but the stairs are creaky

77
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:18,921
and it gets on my nerves.

78
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:20,839
Is that so?

79
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,509
By the way, do you have any salad?

80
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:24,426
Sorry?

81
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:28,472
Breakfast is complimentary,
so I'm afraid this is all we have.

82
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,808
Shouldn't you take better care
of your long-term guests?

83
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:33,310
I can't eat those every morning.

84
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:34,812
Sure.

85
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:45,155
Who are you?

86
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:49,701
And who might you be?

87
00:06:57,668 --> 00:07:00,337
This is our staff member, Seon Woo-hyeol.

88
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:03,298
You saw the flyer yesterday, right?
He's the one who wrote it.

89
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:07,010
I haven't introduced you two
because he was away yesterday.

90
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,430
This is Ms. Hwang So-i,
a long-term guest in Room 201.

91
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:12,057
I see.

92
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,061
You are the first guest of Shaded Oasis.

93
00:07:16,812 --> 00:07:18,188
Welcome.

94
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:21,400
May you enjoy your time here.

95
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:22,985
Why do you talk like that?

96
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:31,660
Woo-hyeol.

97
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:34,496
Can we talk?

98
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,511
What's the matter?

99
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:51,430
Did something happen yesterday?

100
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:53,724
No.

101
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:57,394
Are you not feeling well then?

102
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:01,857
You don't have a fever.

103
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,860
Right, you can't have one.

104
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:08,739
Did something happen
while you were handing out rice cakes?

105
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,993
- No.
- Then why the long face?

106
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:14,203
What do you mean?

107
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,788
What long face?

108
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:18,248
I can tell.

109
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:19,625
Did you think I wouldn't know?

110
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:22,711
I have my eye on every action you take
and every face you make.

111
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:28,175
Isn't that

112
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:29,426
stalking?

113
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:31,595
Don't be ridiculous.

114
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:36,225
I'm just saying
that I'm concerned about you.

115
00:08:37,768 --> 00:08:40,854
So tell me if something's wrong, okay?

116
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:42,272
I should know.

117
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,149
I'm your boss,

118
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:46,026
and you're my...

119
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:48,570
employee.

120
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:53,158
So it's a master-servant relationship?

121
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:56,912
Let's call it
an employer-employee relationship.

122
00:08:57,246 --> 00:08:58,872
You work for me.

123
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:01,625
Speaking of which,
we should negotiate the terms.

124
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:04,878
DISTRIBUTION OF RESPONSIBILITIES

125
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:07,089
CUSTOMER SERVICE, BREAKFAST PREP,
ROOM CLEANING, CLEANING,

126
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:08,840
SUPPLIES MANAGEMENT,
WASH BEDDING, RECYCLING, MAKE BEDS

127
00:09:08,924 --> 00:09:11,301
We need to divide our work clearly.

128
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:13,887
Divide our work?

129
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:17,057
We need to clarify our responsibilities
so you don't slack off again.

130
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:19,184
Slack off?

131
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:21,144
I never slacked off.

132
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:24,523
If you disappear during working hours,
that's slacking off.

133
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:29,945
I'll be in charge of customer service

134
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:32,531
and preparing breakfast,
so don't worry about them.

135
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:36,493
Then we're left with
room cleaning, bathroom cleaning,

136
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,412
living room and kitchen cleaning,

137
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,956
supplies management,
washing the bedding, and recycling.

138
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,124
That's about it.

139
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:43,166
How should we do this?

140
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:47,629
I'll be in charge of room cleaning

141
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:49,881
and recycling.

142
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:51,717
Leave them to me.

143
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,552
You know I'm quite good at cleaning.

144
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,053
I see you're experienced.

145
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:57,764
You should also take charge of
supplies management.

146
00:09:57,848 --> 00:10:00,767
I'll clean the living room,
the kitchen, and the bathroom.

147
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:03,353
We can wash and change
the bedding together.

148
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:04,313
Deal?

149
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:05,272
Deal.

150
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:06,481
We'll split the profits 50-50.

151
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:08,108
It'll be deducted from your debt.

152
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:09,651
Wait, 50-50...

153
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:11,111
All right.

154
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:13,572
Negotiations are sealed with a handshake.

155
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:16,241
But 50-50...

156
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,124
Your hand is still cold.

157
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:29,963
I'll handle the guests most of the time,

158
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:32,090
so be careful not to reveal your identity.

159
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:35,594
I know that you're harmless,

160
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:38,889
but others may not think like me.

161
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,141
Do you understand me?

162
00:10:42,351 --> 00:10:43,268
Yes.

163
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:45,645
I didn't know

164
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:47,564
you cared about me so much.

165
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:49,358
I'm honored.

166
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:51,943
Right.

167
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:53,695
I have a question.

168
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:54,821
What is it?

169
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:55,864
Well...

170
00:10:56,615 --> 00:10:59,409
If we're working like this every day,

171
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:01,536
when do we rest?

172
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:04,331
We need to have some days off

173
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:08,126
so that you can go on dates with Do-sik.

174
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:09,669
What dates?

175
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:11,963
Why would I do that with him?

176
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:13,465
We're not in that kind of relationship.

177
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:14,508
Why not?!

178
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:15,801
Why...

179
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:19,054
Why aren't you guys
in that kind of relationship?

180
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:21,765
I thought things were going well.

181
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:27,312
My priority is the guest house,
not my relationship with him.

182
00:11:27,396 --> 00:11:29,648
How can we rest when we've invested
so much money in this?

183
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,525
We're going to work every day
for the time being.

184
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,193
- What?
- I'll get going then.

185
00:11:34,653 --> 00:11:35,654
What...

186
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,323
Things weren't going well?

187
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:50,877
What?

188
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:51,920
No!

189
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:54,339
What's going on? You can't do this!

190
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:56,591
Stop it!

191
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:58,218
What are you guys doing?!

192
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:02,222
It's illegal to operate a business here.
Didn't you know?

193
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:05,475
Still, how could you tear the place down
without letting me know?

194
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:06,726
We can. It's the law.

195
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:09,771
Article 61, Paragraph 1 of the Road Act.
Permission to Occupy and Use Roads.

196
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:11,398
You want me to keep going?

197
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:14,651
I didn't know.
Please let me off this once.

198
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:15,819
I need to make ends meet.

199
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:18,697
What do you mean you didn't know?
Look how many warnings you got.

200
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,323
You're lying through your teeth.

201
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:21,908
Whatever.

202
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:24,703
If you feel wronged, get a permit first.

203
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:25,787
Follow the law.

204
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:32,252
What are you doing? Tear it down.

205
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:34,212
Wait, hang on.

206
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:37,883
Make sure you tear it down completely.

207
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:43,305
WARNING

208
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,357
Here, drink this.

209
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:57,319
Hey, just let it go and drink up.

210
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,830
Do they know how much that tent cost?

211
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,124
On top of that,
they broke all my furniture.

212
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:14,336
I should sue them.

213
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:15,420
Hey.

214
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:18,507
You committed way more illegal acts.

215
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:20,717
You forged IDs and official documents.

216
00:13:21,343 --> 00:13:23,428
You should be thankful
that you didn't get caught.

217
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:25,055
If you did,

218
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:27,098
you'd be behind bars by now.

219
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,809
Now that this has happened,

220
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:31,645
why don't you learn a skill or two?

221
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:34,648
Seriously? There you go again.

222
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:36,983
This is my skill!

223
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:39,861
Stop hiding in the shade
and doing illegal activities.

224
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:43,114
Come out into the light
and live an upright life!

225
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:44,783
I'm saying this for you!

226
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:46,660
Why would a vampire come into the light?

227
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:48,703
I like being in the shade! It suits me!

228
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:49,955
When will you grow up?

229
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:52,207
You still can't see straight
after all this?

230
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:54,751
Goodness.

231
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,796
Who are you to say that to him?

232
00:13:58,463 --> 00:13:59,673
Hello, sir.

233
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:01,258
How can you be so relaxed?

234
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:05,136
The shop next door
is packed with customers,

235
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,305
yet you guys
are sitting around and chatting.

236
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:10,183
Your shop has been
doing poorly for a while now.

237
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:12,644
Can you even pay rent at this rate?

238
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,814
Do you want me to help you?

239
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:17,524
Sorry?

240
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:20,610
What's the point of holding on
to a failed business?

241
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:23,822
If it's difficult for you to quit,
I can help you.

242
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:25,031
What do you mean?

243
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:28,159
I've talked with the
owner of Vampire Tteokbokki

244
00:14:28,243 --> 00:14:29,661
and they're going to expand the shop.

245
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:31,079
- Hey, Vampire!
- Yes, sir.

246
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:32,205
Come on in.

247
00:14:32,581 --> 00:14:34,749
Take a look around.

248
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,042
- Okay.
- Go ahead.

249
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:38,169
Sir,

250
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:40,422
you're crossing the line.

251
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:41,590
What line?

252
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:44,509
There's no line in the jungle.

253
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:46,761
Your contract is up soon anyway.

254
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:49,306
Move out by next month, okay?

255
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:50,849
Hey, Vampire.

256
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:52,601
I'll get going.

257
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:56,271
I'm offended.

258
00:14:56,688 --> 00:14:58,106
I told you to get a haircut!

259
00:14:58,690 --> 00:14:59,691
You're stubborn as a mule!

260
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:02,527
You look horrendous.

261
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:10,702
Don't worry.

262
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:11,786
You look great.

263
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:14,539
I think you could use a haircut.

264
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:20,545
Ms. Joo,

265
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:22,380
congratulations on the opening.

266
00:15:22,631 --> 00:15:23,757
Ms. Na.

267
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:26,259
Thank you for coming. I know you're busy.

268
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:28,470
I wanted to come yesterday,
but I was busy.

269
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:35,143
They renovated the place beautifully.

270
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:37,354
It's nice.

271
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:42,442
The painting fits right in too.

272
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:46,780
By the way, where's Mr. Seon?

273
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:49,240
He went to the grocery store,
but he should be back soon.

274
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:50,867
Do you want some tea?

275
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:52,118
Sounds good.

276
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:05,507
If your families are acquainted,

277
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:09,010
were you and Mr. Seon like siblings
growing up?

278
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,683
We weren't that close.

279
00:16:16,518 --> 00:16:18,853
But he's someone I have to look out for.

280
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:23,358
What kind of person is he?

281
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,279
Was that too out of the blue?

282
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:31,408
I thought you'd know him well
since you live with him.

283
00:16:35,537 --> 00:16:36,538
He's...

284
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:40,083
a little odd and unusual.

285
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,043
Not a little. Very.

286
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:45,839
But that's his charm.

287
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:47,757
He's different from other men.

288
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:51,511
He lets my guard down.

289
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:56,433
It's comfortable and fun to be around him.

290
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:05,567
What do you think about Mr. Shin?

291
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,777
- Sorry?
- Why are you so surprised?

292
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:10,697
It was just too sudden.

293
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:13,992
It seems like he really cares about you.

294
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:16,369
So I was wondering what you think of him.

295
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:26,463
SHADED OASIS GUEST HOUSE

296
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:32,635
I owe Do-sik a lot.

297
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:34,929
If it weren't for him,

298
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:37,265
I wouldn't have even thought of
opening a guest house.

299
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:40,477
He helped me with everything
down to the smallest detail.

300
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:42,771
During the renovation--

301
00:17:42,854 --> 00:17:45,106
And you're still going to play dumb?

302
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:48,526
Will you keep turning a blind eye
when it's so obvious?

303
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:50,653
Well...

304
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:59,954
I think I should focus
on the guest house for now.

305
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:02,707
It's not the time to date.

306
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,918
To be honest,

307
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:07,504
I don't even feel like it.

308
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,381
Really?

309
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,185
Mr. Seon.

310
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:35,198
Ms. Na, what brings you here?

311
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,325
I wanted to see
your gratitude for my gift.

312
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:38,701
How do you like the car?

313
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,370
Why don't you take me for a ride?

314
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,416
As you can see, I'm working.

315
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:50,588
No, it's fine.

316
00:18:50,672 --> 00:18:51,589
You can go out.

317
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:55,134
We're not busy right now,
so I can handle it alone.

318
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:56,719
Take her for a ride.

319
00:19:05,562 --> 00:19:07,188
You're not like your usual self.

320
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:09,107
Is something up?

321
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:13,945
No,

322
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:15,780
nothing's up.

323
00:19:17,532 --> 00:19:18,867
Are you nervous

324
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,577
to be on a date with me?

325
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:27,876
The weather is so nice today.

326
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:30,378
Do you want to go somewhere far away?

327
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:34,757
Right.

328
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:37,093
Do you think Ms. Joo
will scold you for it?

329
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:39,470
Scold? Who is she to scold me?

330
00:19:39,971 --> 00:19:43,224
I've always been the one to scold others,
but never the other way around.

331
00:19:43,892 --> 00:19:46,060
You always seem to be
walking on eggshells around her.

332
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,443
I won't take up too much of your time.

333
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:56,529
You don't want to get on the bad side
of your boss from the start.

334
00:19:57,697 --> 00:20:00,742
It's been a while
since I've been this excited.

335
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:22,263
But that's his charm.

336
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:24,349
He's different from other men.

337
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:27,936
He lets my guard down.

338
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:32,732
It's comfortable and fun to be around him.

339
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:37,153
He's not just different
from other men, Ms. Na.

340
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:41,074
You'll pass out
when you find out he's a vampire.

341
00:20:53,336 --> 00:20:55,880
It feels like we're in a painting.

342
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:59,676
You're walking around this beautiful place
with a beautiful woman.

343
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,470
But why do you look so sad

344
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:04,514
as if you have sad memories of daffodils?

345
00:21:08,226 --> 00:21:10,019
When you look at beautiful things,

346
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:11,771
you're bound to become sad.

347
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:15,525
Seeing the flowers in full bloom

348
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:20,321
reminds me that they will soon fall.

349
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,866
I'm not sure how I feel.

350
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:25,660
Should I have been

351
00:21:26,244 --> 00:21:27,870
less beautiful then?

352
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:38,715
Look at them all you want
while we're here.

353
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,591
And breathe them in as well.

354
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:49,684
It was a long time ago

355
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:51,102
when I first saw that mansion.

356
00:21:51,561 --> 00:21:54,272
But I still vividly remember
how I felt then.

357
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,401
It wasn't just an old,
run-down house to me.

358
00:21:58,776 --> 00:22:03,614
It felt as if it had been waiting
for someone there for a long time.

359
00:22:06,284 --> 00:22:08,244
You remember our first encounter, right?

360
00:22:09,871 --> 00:22:12,290
A man who I'd never met before
hugged me out of the blue.

361
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:13,916
But oddly,

362
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,835
I wasn't frightened.

363
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:21,132
When I got back home that day,
I thought long and hard.

364
00:22:21,883 --> 00:22:22,800
"Who on earth

365
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:24,927
is this man?"

366
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,931
I just thought you were
interesting at first,

367
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:31,601
but then it hit me

368
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:36,022
that perhaps the reason why
I was so drawn to the mansion

369
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,274
for no particular reason

370
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:41,402
was to meet you.

371
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:48,576
You intrigue me, Mr. Seon.

372
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:51,329
And I want to know more

373
00:22:52,455 --> 00:22:54,123
about you.

374
00:23:09,347 --> 00:23:10,515
May I...

375
00:23:12,016 --> 00:23:13,184
hug you?

376
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:35,873
Please...

377
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,835
wait just a little longer.

378
00:23:40,962 --> 00:23:42,547
I have something I must sort out.

379
00:23:47,677 --> 00:23:49,053
After that,

380
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,974
I shall keep our promise.

381
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:56,227
No matter what.

382
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:02,066
Does Ms. Joo know about Seon Woo-hyeol?

383
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:04,652
I'm not sure.

384
00:24:06,154 --> 00:24:08,865
It felt as if she was
trying to protect him.

385
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,909
But I'm not sure if she knows
he's a vampire.

386
00:24:11,993 --> 00:24:13,452
What's your plan?

387
00:24:14,662 --> 00:24:16,831
Nothing serious has happened yet,

388
00:24:17,415 --> 00:24:20,001
but who knows what can happen?

389
00:24:23,004 --> 00:24:24,964
Please keep an eye on him
for the time being.

390
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:28,718
And see if there are other vampires
around him.

391
00:24:29,886 --> 00:24:31,971
Report back to me
down to every last detail.

392
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:33,055
Yes, sir.

393
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:44,358
Why do you always do as you please?

394
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:47,445
You stood me up and ignored my calls.

395
00:24:47,737 --> 00:24:48,738
What are you playing at?

396
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:53,743
What does he have to sort out?

397
00:24:57,622 --> 00:24:59,081
And what promise?

398
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:04,045
What's with you today?

399
00:25:04,378 --> 00:25:06,380
What did you do all day?

400
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:08,633
I'm so curious.

401
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,261
It's driving me crazy.

402
00:25:17,642 --> 00:25:18,643
Look into it for me.

403
00:25:19,352 --> 00:25:20,978
- Look into what?
- Seon Woo-hyeol.

404
00:25:21,062 --> 00:25:23,397
Look into him as fast as possible.

405
00:25:24,815 --> 00:25:25,816
What do you mean?

406
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,443
What he did in the past,

407
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,904
why he lives in that mansion
with Joo In-hae,

408
00:25:29,987 --> 00:25:32,823
and everything else that's related to him.

409
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,034
You can do it, right?

410
00:25:37,078 --> 00:25:38,454
Why aren't you answering?

411
00:25:41,249 --> 00:25:43,000
I'll pay you handsomely.

412
00:25:43,084 --> 00:25:44,335
I know you like money.

413
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,235
Are you just getting home?

414
00:26:13,823 --> 00:26:14,949
Where are you going?

415
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:22,290
You had fun all day, so it's time to work.

416
00:26:22,707 --> 00:26:24,208
You're in charge of recycling.

417
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:31,173
Okay.

418
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:34,176
What? Where are you going?

419
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,511
You need to take out the trash today.

420
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,722
Do I have to nag you
about every single thing?

421
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:47,898
What's wrong?

422
00:26:47,982 --> 00:26:49,817
Are you not in the mood to work

423
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,944
after having fun all day?

424
00:26:56,449 --> 00:26:57,408
Fun?

425
00:26:57,908 --> 00:27:00,995
Do I look like I'm having fun to you?

426
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:08,669
Do you know how I feel?

427
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:11,088
Do you know how I feel inside?

428
00:27:11,714 --> 00:27:14,383
You think I had fun today?

429
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:15,426
No.

430
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:19,513
My heart is in a million pieces.

431
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:24,101
It's not like I'm at ease either.

432
00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:29,231
I know how much you resent and loathe me
even without you making it obvious.

433
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:30,399
I can feel it.

434
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,486
You believe that I ruined it all

435
00:27:33,903 --> 00:27:35,529
because you couldn't
become human because of me.

436
00:27:36,906 --> 00:27:38,783
So the closer you become to Ms. Na,

437
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,910
the more you loathe me.

438
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:42,453
You're right.

439
00:27:43,537 --> 00:27:44,789
It's all your fault.

440
00:27:44,872 --> 00:27:46,040
This is all on you.

441
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:51,879
Everything is ruined

442
00:27:53,047 --> 00:27:54,173
because you woke me up.

443
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:55,216
It's all a mess!

444
00:27:56,258 --> 00:27:58,219
All because of you
and your poisonous blood.

445
00:28:03,724 --> 00:28:04,642
It's all over.

446
00:28:18,114 --> 00:28:20,991
LEE SANG HAE
PARK DONG-SEOP, MR. KO, BUTLER JOO

447
00:28:21,075 --> 00:28:23,411
Our last resort

448
00:28:24,078 --> 00:28:25,955
is to find the gold bars.

449
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:27,915
Hey, forget about the gold bars

450
00:28:27,998 --> 00:28:29,542
and go find a job.

451
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:32,002
We should see this to the end.

452
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:39,927
The only people who could freely enter
the house except for Mr. Ko

453
00:28:40,261 --> 00:28:41,929
were Butler Joo's family.

454
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:44,974
If they took the gold bars,

455
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:47,852
they would've quit being butlers
and gone abroad already.

456
00:28:47,935 --> 00:28:49,645
Why would they stay here?

457
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,021
Hey, put on your sunscreen!

458
00:28:52,648 --> 00:28:55,067
- Maybe things went wrong.
- What?

459
00:28:55,151 --> 00:28:58,696
Butler Joo wouldn't have opened the coffin

460
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:01,866
if she had inherited her duties properly.

461
00:29:02,283 --> 00:29:03,909
She should've known about Woo-hyeol

462
00:29:03,993 --> 00:29:06,954
and that the coffin wasn't supposed
to be opened.

463
00:29:07,037 --> 00:29:10,207
But she was clueless and opened it.

464
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:12,585
It's strange.

465
00:29:12,668 --> 00:29:13,627
You think so?

466
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:15,588
Hold on.

467
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:17,840
Here.

468
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:23,679
There's something fishy about her family.

469
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:27,975
Who is it at this hour?

470
00:29:30,561 --> 00:29:31,562
Woo-hyeol.

471
00:29:37,818 --> 00:29:39,862
Why would you buy something you can't eat?

472
00:29:44,992 --> 00:29:47,995
I just want to get drunk tonight.

473
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:52,875
- Woo-hyeol.
- Woo-hyeol.

474
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:54,376
Wait.

475
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,212
What are you doing? You can't.

476
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:57,213
Don't do it.

477
00:30:06,055 --> 00:30:08,390
Woo-hyeol, are you okay?

478
00:30:10,184 --> 00:30:11,393
Of course.

479
00:30:16,607 --> 00:30:18,025
You guys know

480
00:30:19,235 --> 00:30:20,569
how hard I tried

481
00:30:21,654 --> 00:30:23,239
to become human.

482
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:24,698
I...

483
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:27,785
I truly gave

484
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:29,870
my absolute best.

485
00:30:29,954 --> 00:30:31,372
Even if no one else knows,

486
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:32,831
we do.

487
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:35,793
How did things turn out this way?

488
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,802
It's all because of Butler Joo.

489
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:46,804
If it weren't for her,

490
00:30:47,388 --> 00:30:51,100
Hae-sun and I would be loving each other
with all our hearts.

491
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:54,103
I would've been

492
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:58,399
able to keep the promise
I made to Hae-sun.

493
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:03,654
How is it that...

494
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:06,991
I'm not even given the chance

495
00:31:07,908 --> 00:31:09,451
to live for the person I love...

496
00:31:11,579 --> 00:31:12,830
before I die?

497
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:18,210
Woo-hyeol, why would you die?

498
00:31:18,294 --> 00:31:21,547
You know we can't die.

499
00:31:22,423 --> 00:31:24,258
Things are rough for us too.

500
00:31:24,758 --> 00:31:27,928
My tarot tent got torn down,
and Seop got kicked out of his shop.

501
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,431
But we still need to pay our rent
and monthly expenses.

502
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:33,142
Humans are sucking us dry.

503
00:31:34,852 --> 00:31:35,936
You got kicked out?

504
00:31:36,687 --> 00:31:37,813
What do you mean?

505
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:40,065
Why would you tell him that?

506
00:31:40,149 --> 00:31:41,859
He's worried now.

507
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:49,575
As your leader,

508
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:51,660
it's my job to support you guys.

509
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:53,787
I'm sorry.

510
00:31:53,871 --> 00:31:55,539
Why are you saying that?

511
00:31:55,873 --> 00:31:57,374
Don't worry about us.

512
00:31:57,458 --> 00:32:00,085
You just focus on becoming human.

513
00:32:00,628 --> 00:32:01,962
Mr. Ko said

514
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:05,758
this is the most crucial
but the most dangerous time of your life.

515
00:32:11,764 --> 00:32:13,182
SHADED OASIS GUEST HOUSE

516
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:14,391
RESERVATIONS: 0

517
00:32:18,479 --> 00:32:20,022
It's all your fault.

518
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:21,523
This is all on you.

519
00:32:24,193 --> 00:32:25,819
Everything is ruined

520
00:32:26,362 --> 00:32:27,613
because you woke me up.

521
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:28,656
It's all a mess!

522
00:32:29,782 --> 00:32:31,825
All because of you
and your poisonous blood.

523
00:32:35,329 --> 00:32:36,246
It's all over.

524
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:02,231
Can I get a room?

525
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:03,607
Right.

526
00:33:03,857 --> 00:33:04,733
Yes,

527
00:33:05,067 --> 00:33:06,193
you can.

528
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:19,915
I didn't expect this place to be
so clean and spacious from the outside.

529
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:30,467
Goodness.

530
00:33:32,553 --> 00:33:34,263
You can stay in this room.

531
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:36,348
- Here's your key.
- Right.

532
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:37,683
Thank you.

533
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:39,768
Breakfast is served between 7 to 9 a.m.

534
00:33:39,852 --> 00:33:41,228
in the kitchen on the first floor.

535
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:44,398
You can help yourself
to toast, fried eggs, and cereal.

536
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:46,108
The bathroom is on the first floor.

537
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,653
If you need anything
or experience any inconveniences,

538
00:33:49,737 --> 00:33:51,321
feel free to let me know.

539
00:33:51,655 --> 00:33:52,906
Rest up then.

540
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:54,116
Hold on.

541
00:33:55,325 --> 00:33:56,952
Are you the owner?

542
00:33:57,786 --> 00:33:59,121
- Yes.
- I see.

543
00:33:59,997 --> 00:34:03,000
It must not be easy for a young lady
to run a guest house alone.

544
00:34:03,876 --> 00:34:05,043
It's admirable.

545
00:34:06,336 --> 00:34:09,131
Your parents did a good job raising you.

546
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:11,008
They must be proud.

547
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:15,387
Gosh, not at all.

548
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:17,347
I have a daughter

549
00:34:17,431 --> 00:34:18,682
and she's in high school.

550
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:20,726
She lives in the US with her mom.

551
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:24,772
She moved there in elementary school,
so it's been ten years already.

552
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,315
Time flies.

553
00:34:27,357 --> 00:34:30,944
She's a clever one,
so I sent her abroad when she was young.

554
00:34:31,028 --> 00:34:33,030
But it's no piece of cake to support her.

555
00:34:34,364 --> 00:34:35,741
Oh, I have a picture.

556
00:34:36,116 --> 00:34:37,785
She looks nothing like me.

557
00:34:37,993 --> 00:34:39,036
Take a look.

558
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,623
Goodness.

559
00:34:43,207 --> 00:34:46,168
I live alone,
so I usually have no one to talk to.

560
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:47,878
I apologize for being so chatty.

561
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:49,087
It's late, so please.

562
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:51,298
Okay.

563
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,425
Good night then.

564
00:34:53,509 --> 00:34:55,302
- Good night.
- Bye.

565
00:34:57,221 --> 00:34:58,680
Thank you.

566
00:35:38,804 --> 00:35:41,139
Woo-hyeol must've been really distressed.

567
00:35:41,223 --> 00:35:44,268
Look at all this human food he had.

568
00:35:45,269 --> 00:35:46,270
Tell me about it.

569
00:35:46,353 --> 00:35:48,522
He must've been so distressed.
Should we try some?

570
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:51,650
Look at him. He's fine.

571
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:53,151
So what if we get a little drunk?

572
00:35:53,235 --> 00:35:55,821
We're different from him.

573
00:35:55,904 --> 00:35:59,575
Come on. Let me drink
my problems away for once!

574
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:00,701
Isn't life hard for you too?

575
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:03,120
Then shall we?

576
00:36:03,203 --> 00:36:04,580
Should we try just one?

577
00:36:10,961 --> 00:36:13,130
This looks good.

578
00:36:22,723 --> 00:36:23,724
What?

579
00:36:26,226 --> 00:36:27,352
This is tastier than I...

580
00:36:37,154 --> 00:36:39,156
I only make this for my daughter.

581
00:36:40,908 --> 00:36:41,950
What is this?

582
00:36:43,285 --> 00:36:45,287
It's so soft and delicious.

583
00:36:45,913 --> 00:36:46,830
- It's good, right?
- Yes.

584
00:36:46,914 --> 00:36:48,206
I'm glad you like it.

585
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:52,419
Good morning, ma'am.

586
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,880
You're up early on the weekend.

587
00:36:54,963 --> 00:36:57,132
You wake up earlier as you get old.

588
00:36:58,467 --> 00:36:59,718
Do you want to try some?

589
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:01,845
Me? No, it's fine.

590
00:37:01,929 --> 00:37:03,055
Come on.

591
00:37:03,764 --> 00:37:04,890
Have a bite.

592
00:37:05,432 --> 00:37:08,852
I'm not great with other dishes,
but I'm great at making toast.

593
00:37:08,936 --> 00:37:11,480
It's much better
than what you get from stores, right?

594
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:12,564
Yes.

595
00:37:12,648 --> 00:37:15,442
This is the best food I've had
since I got here.

596
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:18,278
Try it.

597
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:20,781
Okay.

598
00:37:29,498 --> 00:37:30,791
It's delicious!

599
00:37:32,793 --> 00:37:34,044
How did you make this?

600
00:37:34,127 --> 00:37:36,004
I told you it's good.

601
00:37:37,506 --> 00:37:39,925
It's my secret recipe.

602
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:47,057
My daughter told me
my toast is the best in this world.

603
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,809
You always talk about your daughter.

604
00:37:49,226 --> 00:37:50,644
You must miss her a lot.

605
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:53,105
When did you last see her?

606
00:37:56,108 --> 00:37:57,109
It's been a while.

607
00:37:57,192 --> 00:38:00,028
Do you ever video call with your family?

608
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:03,365
There's a time difference,
and we're all busy.

609
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:05,784
I'm busy making money,

610
00:38:06,076 --> 00:38:08,453
and my wife is busy
looking after our child.

611
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:11,748
And I shouldn't take
my daughter's study time, right?

612
00:38:12,874 --> 00:38:14,751
Money might not be everything.

613
00:38:15,836 --> 00:38:19,589
She might want to eat your toast
more than she needs money.

614
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:45,991
He's still not home?

615
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:47,761
What happened was...

616
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,654
Cheer up, Seop.

617
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:12,160
Just wait until I find the gold bars.

618
00:40:12,869 --> 00:40:16,039
I'll open up a huge shop for you
right next to Vampire Tteokbokki.

619
00:40:16,123 --> 00:40:18,542
I'm sick and tired of tteokbokki.

620
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:22,504
By the way,

621
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:25,298
I wonder if Woo-hyeol got home safely.

622
00:40:25,799 --> 00:40:28,385
I hope Butler Joo
didn't tell him off again.

623
00:40:30,512 --> 00:40:31,429
What is this?

624
00:40:31,513 --> 00:40:32,472
Mr. Ko.

625
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:36,184
What's going on here?

626
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:38,937
- Did your shop go under?
- Yes.

627
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:41,231
Mr. Ko.

628
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:43,191
Aren't you being too harsh?

629
00:40:43,275 --> 00:40:45,986
Why would you bring tteokbokki
to a failed tteokbokki shop?

630
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:49,614
I heard this place has become popular
with a retro concept,

631
00:40:49,906 --> 00:40:51,908
so I thought it could inspire you.

632
00:40:51,992 --> 00:40:53,326
You should've tried harder.

633
00:40:56,496 --> 00:40:58,039
OUR GRANDMA'S TTEOKBOKKI

634
00:40:59,124 --> 00:41:00,917
Should I try the ones
made with flour first

635
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:02,794
or rice?

636
00:41:06,548 --> 00:41:07,549
- It's hot.
- Goodness.

637
00:41:08,008 --> 00:41:09,176
Let me dip it in the sauce.

638
00:41:22,314 --> 00:41:24,232
The pieces have to be big like this

639
00:41:24,774 --> 00:41:27,861
for the food to look appetizing.

640
00:41:28,278 --> 00:41:30,155
Too bad it's too late.

641
00:41:30,447 --> 00:41:31,698
They look appetizing, don't they?

642
00:41:33,158 --> 00:41:35,869
We can't eat it anyway.

643
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:39,581
We tried human food yesterday
with Woo-hyeol,

644
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:41,374
and we almost died.

645
00:41:42,209 --> 00:41:43,877
Seon Woo-hyeol had human food?

646
00:41:44,085 --> 00:41:44,920
Yes.

647
00:41:45,253 --> 00:41:48,423
Just like how humans drink
when they're frustrated,

648
00:41:48,798 --> 00:41:52,344
he brought a load of human food
and went on a binge.

649
00:41:52,636 --> 00:41:54,262
I asked him what was wrong,

650
00:41:54,346 --> 00:41:56,056
and he wouldn't answer.

651
00:41:56,139 --> 00:41:57,057
He's right.

652
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:00,727
He got drunk off of food
and kept going on about dying.

653
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:04,147
You guys didn't stop him
from eating human food?

654
00:42:04,439 --> 00:42:05,482
You only watched?

655
00:42:05,565 --> 00:42:07,275
Why? Is it bad?

656
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:09,945
He's not fully human yet,
so it can't be good.

657
00:42:11,947 --> 00:42:14,616
If he had human food in his condition,

658
00:42:15,075 --> 00:42:16,326
he must've been very distressed.

659
00:42:18,787 --> 00:42:20,747
What's wrong with his condition?

660
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:22,916
Is he unwell?

661
00:42:26,169 --> 00:42:28,171
Of course. He's heartbroken.

662
00:42:32,384 --> 00:42:33,927
I know it's hard for you too,

663
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:36,096
but take care of him.

664
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:38,348
You guys rely on him too.

665
00:43:10,297 --> 00:43:11,131
Jeez.

666
00:43:11,631 --> 00:43:13,174
How many times did I tell them

667
00:43:13,258 --> 00:43:15,719
anything stained with food
is regular trash?

668
00:43:21,641 --> 00:43:22,475
INCHEON TO CHICAGO

669
00:43:34,029 --> 00:43:36,489
Why are you drinking here alone?

670
00:43:38,158 --> 00:43:39,492
I wanted some air.

671
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:43,288
It's nice out here.

672
00:43:43,872 --> 00:43:44,873
And the moon is bright.

673
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:50,295
It is.

674
00:43:51,004 --> 00:43:53,757
Then enjoy your time.

675
00:43:54,174 --> 00:43:55,425
I'm sorry for interrupting you.

676
00:43:56,426 --> 00:43:57,677
My daughter...

677
00:43:58,887 --> 00:44:00,513
doesn't miss me.

678
00:44:12,525 --> 00:44:13,818
After some time,

679
00:44:14,903 --> 00:44:15,987
I felt like

680
00:44:16,738 --> 00:44:19,949
I'm no more than a machine
that sends her money.

681
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:22,911
My wife and I
have been drifting apart too.

682
00:44:23,703 --> 00:44:26,498
And it seems like they're not comfortable
with me visiting anymore.

683
00:44:27,415 --> 00:44:29,793
Even if I spend a fortune to visit them,

684
00:44:29,876 --> 00:44:31,628
they don't seem to welcome me anymore.

685
00:44:33,088 --> 00:44:36,674
So I just send them money instead.

686
00:44:43,473 --> 00:44:45,558
I had to use my deposit money

687
00:44:46,101 --> 00:44:48,061
to move to smaller places.

688
00:44:48,144 --> 00:44:49,270
And I think to myself,

689
00:44:50,063 --> 00:44:54,734
"Am I going to die
after getting sucked dry by my family?"

690
00:44:56,194 --> 00:44:57,570
I'm a parent,

691
00:45:00,949 --> 00:45:02,242
but I'm also a person.

692
00:45:04,077 --> 00:45:05,954
Part of me feels hurt by my daughter,

693
00:45:07,163 --> 00:45:09,582
and part of me wants to live
the way I want to.

694
00:45:10,417 --> 00:45:11,543
That's how I feel.

695
00:45:13,503 --> 00:45:16,506
Did Dad feel this way too?

696
00:45:17,674 --> 00:45:18,758
Oh, my.

697
00:45:20,218 --> 00:45:21,386
I'm sorry for ranting.

698
00:45:22,053 --> 00:45:24,097
Just pretend you didn't hear that.

699
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:26,015
Don't worry.

700
00:45:26,099 --> 00:45:28,435
I understand how you feel.

701
00:45:32,355 --> 00:45:36,067
I'm sure your family misses you.

702
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:40,113
It might be that they feel awkward
to express their feelings

703
00:45:41,573 --> 00:45:44,367
because you guys don't see other often.

704
00:45:47,662 --> 00:45:50,165
I've never said this to anyone before,

705
00:45:52,542 --> 00:45:54,878
but my dad...

706
00:45:56,337 --> 00:45:59,549
was missing for a long time

707
00:45:59,966 --> 00:46:01,926
and was recently declared legally dead.

708
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:08,016
No one knows if he's alive or dead.

709
00:46:09,392 --> 00:46:11,102
And I couldn't even hold a funeral.

710
00:46:12,896 --> 00:46:14,022
For a while,

711
00:46:14,564 --> 00:46:16,316
I resented him

712
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:19,152
thinking that he abandoned me.

713
00:46:22,655 --> 00:46:23,907
But I miss him.

714
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:28,203
And I hope he's alive somewhere.

715
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:34,083
Even if he did abandon me,

716
00:46:36,753 --> 00:46:37,921
he's still my dad.

717
00:46:40,924 --> 00:46:42,008
It must've been...

718
00:46:43,468 --> 00:46:45,553
really tough for you.

719
00:46:53,937 --> 00:46:56,356
Since you spoke your mind to me

720
00:46:56,439 --> 00:46:59,484
from a dad's perspective,

721
00:47:00,735 --> 00:47:03,780
I wanted to speak mine to you
from a daughter's perspective.

722
00:47:05,031 --> 00:47:07,325
I'm sure

723
00:47:07,408 --> 00:47:11,454
your family misses and cares about you

724
00:47:12,497 --> 00:47:14,082
much more than you think.

725
00:47:20,797 --> 00:47:21,798
Thanks for saying that.

726
00:47:23,383 --> 00:47:24,509
I want to thank you too.

727
00:48:07,594 --> 00:48:09,679
NEIGHBORHOOD PATROL

728
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:14,851
Why are you alone?

729
00:48:14,934 --> 00:48:15,852
Where's Mr. Ox Blood?

730
00:48:16,394 --> 00:48:19,480
Well, he has plans,
so he couldn't make it.

731
00:48:19,564 --> 00:48:20,940
We're an odd number of people then.

732
00:48:21,441 --> 00:48:23,318
He should've kept this promise.

733
00:48:23,401 --> 00:48:24,569
- Right?
- Of course.

734
00:48:24,652 --> 00:48:26,404
Why is he so irresponsible?

735
00:48:26,487 --> 00:48:30,074
Do you think we're all here
because we have nothing better to do?

736
00:48:30,158 --> 00:48:32,118
Wait, isn't that him?

737
00:48:38,875 --> 00:48:39,959
I apologize for being late.

738
00:48:41,836 --> 00:48:44,964
If you're late or absent without notice
from now on,

739
00:48:45,048 --> 00:48:47,508
you'll be fine so make sure to be on time.

740
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:51,179
I will.

741
00:48:53,014 --> 00:48:53,931
We're in pairs now.

742
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:56,351
Let's patrol our designated areas

743
00:48:56,434 --> 00:48:58,936
and meet back here.

744
00:48:59,437 --> 00:49:01,105
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

745
00:49:01,189 --> 00:49:02,315
- Here.
- Okay.

746
00:49:02,398 --> 00:49:04,901
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

747
00:49:08,363 --> 00:49:10,073
How could you leave without telling me?

748
00:49:10,156 --> 00:49:11,157
Who are you?

749
00:49:11,741 --> 00:49:12,784
Look here.

750
00:49:18,373 --> 00:49:19,415
I'm sorry.

751
00:49:20,833 --> 00:49:21,751
I thought about it,

752
00:49:22,585 --> 00:49:23,795
and I was a little harsh.

753
00:49:23,878 --> 00:49:24,796
No,

754
00:49:25,254 --> 00:49:26,506
very harsh.

755
00:49:28,424 --> 00:49:30,176
I know you didn't do it on purpose.

756
00:49:32,762 --> 00:49:33,721
I'm sorry.

757
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:36,891
How could you stay out all night
without telling your boss?

758
00:49:37,517 --> 00:49:39,227
That was an accident.

759
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:41,104
I got drunk on human food

760
00:49:41,187 --> 00:49:44,190
and passed out at my friends' place.

761
00:49:44,273 --> 00:49:45,775
Are you serious?

762
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,276
Why do you keep eating...

763
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:51,322
human food?

764
00:49:51,406 --> 00:49:52,990
What if something goes wrong?

765
00:49:53,366 --> 00:49:55,576
I couldn't help it
because I was too distressed.

766
00:50:04,377 --> 00:50:06,421
- I won't allow it from now on.
- What?

767
00:50:06,504 --> 00:50:09,632
I won't allow you to leave work
during working hours.

768
00:50:10,049 --> 00:50:12,844
I won't let you ditch work
even if it's for Ms. Na.

769
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:13,761
Got it?

770
00:50:16,973 --> 00:50:17,974
Okay.

771
00:50:19,726 --> 00:50:20,852
And when you stay out,

772
00:50:20,935 --> 00:50:23,062
tell me where you're going beforehand.

773
00:50:23,146 --> 00:50:24,480
Don't just disappear.

774
00:50:24,939 --> 00:50:27,608
I don't want another person
to disappear again.

775
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:32,280
I promise I'll do that.

776
00:50:39,495 --> 00:50:41,289
- Aren't you coming?
- I am.

777
00:51:22,163 --> 00:51:23,706
I didn't know there was such a place here.

778
00:51:28,002 --> 00:51:30,046
So this is where he's been hiding out.

779
00:52:13,005 --> 00:52:14,257
They look great.

780
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:19,345
You shouldn't stare at people.

781
00:52:19,428 --> 00:52:20,429
- What?
- Let's go.

782
00:52:20,513 --> 00:52:22,807
- Hurry up.
- I'm just...

783
00:52:26,811 --> 00:52:29,856
Don't you want to experience love
that makes your heart beat

784
00:52:29,939 --> 00:52:31,232
like the couple we just saw?

785
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,026
You're the one who said

786
00:52:34,902 --> 00:52:36,779
my blood is filled with poison.

787
00:52:39,448 --> 00:52:40,741
Love isn't for me.

788
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:43,911
You still had that on your mind?

789
00:52:44,245 --> 00:52:45,913
I'm sorry.

790
00:52:46,414 --> 00:52:47,248
No.

791
00:52:47,707 --> 00:52:50,293
I think it could be true.

792
00:52:52,003 --> 00:52:54,964
I admit that I lived
with only one thing on my mind.

793
00:52:56,507 --> 00:52:58,801
All I talked about was money

794
00:53:00,678 --> 00:53:03,556
as if it was something
that could solve all my problems.

795
00:53:05,433 --> 00:53:07,018
Of course money is great.

796
00:53:08,352 --> 00:53:09,228
But still,

797
00:53:09,896 --> 00:53:12,315
some things are more important than money.

798
00:53:14,984 --> 00:53:16,611
But I had no choice.

799
00:53:17,612 --> 00:53:21,365
Money was the most important thing
if I wanted to survive alone.

800
00:53:24,452 --> 00:53:25,578
Love?

801
00:53:28,497 --> 00:53:29,540
I'm not sure.

802
00:53:38,716 --> 00:53:40,509
Do you see that tree up there?

803
00:53:42,845 --> 00:53:44,889
The chances of me falling in love

804
00:53:45,306 --> 00:53:49,060
are equal to flowers blooming
on that dead tree.

805
00:53:51,145 --> 00:53:53,105
What do you mean by that?

806
00:53:53,189 --> 00:53:55,524
Have you ever seen
flowers blooming on a dead tree?

807
00:53:56,651 --> 00:53:59,737
I'm saying that it's close to impossible.

808
00:54:01,447 --> 00:54:03,699
Only those who have been in love
know how to love.

809
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:07,078
I've never been in love,

810
00:54:07,536 --> 00:54:09,497
so I have no love to give anyone.

811
00:54:10,998 --> 00:54:13,334
On top of that, I'm struggling
to even love myself right now.

812
00:54:16,671 --> 00:54:17,755
Let's go in.

813
00:54:42,613 --> 00:54:43,948
You're running out of time.

814
00:54:44,031 --> 00:54:46,701
You'll begin to experience
abnormal symptoms like today.

815
00:54:46,951 --> 00:54:48,369
You'll feel worse and worse.

816
00:55:20,651 --> 00:55:23,696
I greatly enjoyed my stay here
thanks to you.

817
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:26,574
I'm sure good things will come to you too.

818
00:55:28,034 --> 00:55:29,368
I actually

819
00:55:29,452 --> 00:55:30,619
run a toast shop.

820
00:55:43,966 --> 00:55:45,760
Me falling in love

821
00:55:45,843 --> 00:55:49,722
is the same as flowers blooming
on that dead tree.

822
00:55:55,853 --> 00:55:57,813
CEO SHIN DO-SIK

823
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:05,321
Here.

824
00:56:08,574 --> 00:56:09,700
What's this?

825
00:56:09,784 --> 00:56:11,744
- It's a gift.
- A gift?

826
00:56:11,827 --> 00:56:14,413
I bought it with the money we made
from the guest house.

827
00:56:16,123 --> 00:56:16,957
Right.

828
00:56:17,416 --> 00:56:20,044
I couldn't have opened
the guest house without you.

829
00:56:20,836 --> 00:56:23,631
I've been meaning
to express my gratitude to you,

830
00:56:24,006 --> 00:56:26,550
so I bought this as soon as I made money.

831
00:56:28,094 --> 00:56:29,553
Thank you so much, Do-sik.

832
00:56:31,138 --> 00:56:32,389
I'm honored.

833
00:56:32,973 --> 00:56:33,974
Thank you.

834
00:56:34,058 --> 00:56:37,228
I'll get you something better
when I make more money in the future.

835
00:56:57,957 --> 00:56:58,874
Mr. Shin!

836
00:57:03,087 --> 00:57:04,588
Mr. Shin!

837
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:09,176
It seems like a sudden cardiogenic shock.

838
00:57:10,344 --> 00:57:13,639
There were no problems found in the tests,

839
00:57:14,223 --> 00:57:16,183
so I can't seem to figure out the cause.

840
00:57:16,517 --> 00:57:20,563
I suggest that he rest for now.

841
00:57:21,188 --> 00:57:22,231
Thank you, Doctor.

842
00:57:34,285 --> 00:57:35,744
He doesn't know the cause, right?

843
00:57:37,413 --> 00:57:38,414
Mr. Shin!

844
00:57:39,790 --> 00:57:40,916
Are you okay?

845
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:45,838
I don't think I've ever shown you
this side of me before.

846
00:57:47,715 --> 00:57:49,049
Can I ask you for a favor?

847
00:58:13,616 --> 00:58:15,326
I brought what you asked for.

848
00:58:16,452 --> 00:58:17,620
Thank you.

849
00:58:17,870 --> 00:58:20,497
You've been keeping
this old book in your safe.

850
00:58:20,956 --> 00:58:21,999
That's right.

851
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:25,461
It's an important book
that's been passed down in my family.

852
00:58:26,629 --> 00:58:28,756
The only way to cure this cursed illness

853
00:58:30,174 --> 00:58:31,217
is written here.

854
00:58:32,801 --> 00:58:34,428
VAMPIRE RECORD BOOK

855
00:58:39,767 --> 00:58:42,937
Find the one who stands between
humans and vampires.

856
00:58:44,021 --> 00:58:47,775
The scar on their body
will reveal their true self.

857
00:58:48,692 --> 00:58:51,070
Take their heart out
and drink their blood.

858
00:58:51,445 --> 00:58:53,155
Then you will become immortal.

859
00:59:03,666 --> 00:59:07,253
Was this the reason
for your regular hospital visits?

860
00:59:09,797 --> 00:59:11,340
I know it's hard to believe,

861
00:59:12,132 --> 00:59:14,635
but the only way I can survive

862
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:17,012
is by following the instructions
in this book.

863
00:59:18,597 --> 00:59:21,141
I must find a half-vampire
with a scar on their body.

864
00:59:22,476 --> 00:59:23,811
Seon Woo-hyeol

865
00:59:24,603 --> 00:59:27,439
might prove to be important
in solving my long-standing problem.

866
00:59:38,951 --> 00:59:40,035
Are you just getting home?

867
00:59:40,995 --> 00:59:42,037
Did you

868
00:59:42,955 --> 00:59:44,623
put these up?

869
00:59:50,963 --> 00:59:52,756
I wanted to show you

870
00:59:55,384 --> 00:59:57,803
that flowers can bloom

871
00:59:58,012 --> 00:59:59,430
even on a dead tree.

872
01:00:00,931 --> 01:00:02,725
And likewise,

873
01:00:03,642 --> 01:00:07,354
you can love and be loved by someone.

874
01:00:26,665 --> 01:00:28,667
Can you tell me?

875
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:33,672
Tell me how you can become human.

876
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:37,509
If flowers can bloom on a dead tree,

877
01:00:37,593 --> 01:00:39,887
who's to say a vampire can't become human?

878
01:00:42,556 --> 01:00:44,099
Tell me if there's a way.

879
01:00:45,392 --> 01:00:46,602
I'll help you.

880
01:01:02,451 --> 01:01:03,577
I need your love.

881
01:01:24,348 --> 01:01:27,726
THANKS TO PARK IN-HWAN AND CHOI DAE-CHUL
FOR THEIR SPECIAL APPEARANCE

882
01:01:40,781 --> 01:01:43,784
HEARTBEAT

883
01:01:43,992 --> 01:01:46,245
What must one do
to have blood full of love?

884
01:01:46,328 --> 01:01:47,746
She put up a wall that can't be broken.

885
01:01:48,122 --> 01:01:49,164
Do-sik is what?

886
01:01:49,248 --> 01:01:51,959
It doesn't seem completely hopeless.

887
01:01:52,042 --> 01:01:53,127
Are you okay?

888
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:56,046
So this is how it feels
to have someone care about you.

889
01:01:56,255 --> 01:01:58,424
It feels like I'm looking at my past self.

890
01:01:58,632 --> 01:02:00,676
Do you recall something?

891
01:02:00,926 --> 01:02:02,386
I like this mansion.

892
01:02:02,678 --> 01:02:04,763
My life has seen more joy.

893
01:02:05,097 --> 01:02:08,434
It bothers and annoys me
that you live with In-hae.

894
01:02:08,976 --> 01:02:10,644
I'm asking you to leave Shaded Oasis.

895
