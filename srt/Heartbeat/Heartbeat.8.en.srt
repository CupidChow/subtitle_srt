I'm fine.

6
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,108
That's a relief.

7
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:51,153
You could've been badly hurt.

8
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:55,950
Mr. Seon.

00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,284
Mr. Seon!

EPISODE 8

11
00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:11,340
I don't know what just happened.

12
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:13,425
I'm sorry about all this.

13
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:16,512
Woo-hyeol usually sleeps when he's drunk,

14
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:18,639
so you don't have to worry.

15
00:02:19,557 --> 00:02:21,183
There's no need to apologize.

16
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:25,062
If it wasn't for him,
I would be in the hospital right now.

17
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,438
I'm grateful.

18
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:27,606
Exactly.

19
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,191
No one got hurt. That's what's important.

20
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:31,277
Don't feel too bad about it.

21
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:36,532
You must've been startled,
so I appreciate your understanding.

22
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:39,660
I'll do my best running the guest house.

23
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:41,120
I believe in you.

24
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,873
Everyone knows Do-sik has the magic touch,

25
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,125
and I'll help with anything you need.

26
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,919
Thank you.

27
00:02:58,304 --> 00:03:00,139
Thank you for coming today.

28
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:01,473
Have a safe trip home.

29
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:03,309
Okay. See you next time.

30
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:04,643
I'll call you.

31
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:39,720
How could he ignore all my prior warnings?

32
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:41,972
He always does as he pleases!

33
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:43,474
Hae-sun.

34
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:48,604
All you talk about is Hae-sun!

35
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:50,105
She left, damn it!

36
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:51,649
Hae-sun.

37
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:53,609
Hae-sun.

38
00:03:56,654 --> 00:03:57,821
Hae-sun...

39
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:17,466
How interesting.

40
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:33,232
Was I just seeing things?

41
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:51,625
I should stop thinking about it.

42
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,775
What the...

43
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:23,574
Where am I?

44
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:26,827
Here. People don't peel shrimp
for just anyone.

45
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:34,960
Hae-sun.

46
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,173
Oh, no!

47
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:41,633
I acted like a fool in front of Hae-sun.

48
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:42,801
My goodness.

49
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:46,889
Are you back to yourself now?

50
00:05:53,604 --> 00:05:56,648
Judging by the agony you're in,
you must remember something.

51
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:03,363
Why didn't you

52
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:07,576
knock me out or something to stop me?

53
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:09,036
I did.

54
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:13,207
My body remembers it.

55
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,420
I'm feeling sick
after eating so much human food,

56
00:06:18,504 --> 00:06:20,589
- so let me have some ox--
- As if!

57
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:25,594
What did I tell you?

58
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:27,930
First, do not speak of Hae-sun.

59
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:30,099
Second, do not make
abrupt physical contact with her.

60
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:32,309
Third, no staring.

61
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:36,355
I told you numerous times not to
do anything that'll reveal your identity!

62
00:06:36,772 --> 00:06:37,648
You did.

63
00:06:38,107 --> 00:06:40,400
How could you not keep a single promise?

64
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:41,568
Well...

65
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,239
Did I break all of them?

66
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:46,240
What would they think

67
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:48,700
now that you made a scene
without drinking a drop of alcohol?

68
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:53,038
I'm sorry.

69
00:06:53,956 --> 00:06:57,167
But how could I have said no to her
when she peeled the shrimp

70
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,086
just for me?

71
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:01,255
You call that an excuse?

72
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:04,174
From now on, human food
is off-limits! You got that?

73
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:06,760
Move!

74
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:12,766
Gosh.

75
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,434
My head is ringing.

76
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:17,896
Here's the evidence.

77
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,023
This is the evidence?

78
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:25,696
So you found a whisker
that you think belongs to Mr. Ko

79
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:29,158
in the basement of the mansion
where the gold was buried.

80
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:33,954
Therefore, you think
Mr. Ko stole the gold.

81
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,084
Don't you think
you're jumping to conclusions?

82
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:42,087
This is... How should I put it?

83
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:45,549
Right. Let's say we found
a long strand of hair here.

84
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:48,927
Won't it be the same as assuming

85
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:50,929
that Dong-seop has a girlfriend?

86
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:53,891
What did I do to get dragged into this?

87
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:56,101
It's an analogy.

88
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,729
A whisker alone isn't enough evidence.

89
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,399
I wasn't going to say this, but...

90
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:05,944
- What is it?
- Cats are known to steal things.

91
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:07,821
They go around stealing food all the time.

92
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,865
You're being ridiculous.

93
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:16,538
Speak of the cat.

94
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:19,750
Isn't it "speak of the devil"?

95
00:08:29,635 --> 00:08:30,677
Hey.

96
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:36,433
Business is slow today anyway, so enjoy.

97
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:41,980
Where's the soy sauce?

98
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:46,693
What the heck?

99
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,362
I gave that to a cat.

100
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:50,155
Who are you?

101
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:54,409
Nice to meet you. I'm Ko Yang-nam.

102
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:57,955
The Mr. Ko we've been hearing of?

103
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:00,249
- Mr. Ko?
- Mr. Ko?

104
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:14,513
Mr. Shin, you have a meeting
with a client this afternoon.

105
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:17,057
Yes, I'm aware of it.

106
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:21,228
Are you feeling unwell?

107
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,355
No, I'm okay.

108
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:29,027
Mr. Gu.

109
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:32,072
Yes, sir.

110
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,828
Do you perhaps

111
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:42,082
believe in ghosts or superstitions?

112
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:43,333
Superstitions?

113
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:44,501
I'm asking

114
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:50,048
if you believe in supernatural creatures
that you see in horror movies.

115
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:51,466
I'm not sure.

116
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:54,678
I've never come across one myself.

117
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:56,805
I see.

118
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,058
Of course.

119
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:04,062
How can you believe they exist
when you've never seen one?

120
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:08,317
Would you believe in them
if you happened to see one?

121
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,860
Of course.

122
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,528
I'd never doubt my own eyes.

123
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,322
You wouldn't doubt them?

124
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:15,741
I see.

125
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:17,868
Of course.

126
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:19,995
I should believe what I see.

127
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:21,955
What is this about?

128
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:23,540
Then

129
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,751
let me try trusting your eyes instead.

130
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:29,254
Here's the soy sauce.

131
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:36,887
Aren't you the one
who came by for a reading?

132
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:38,555
At least you're observant.

133
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,891
I knew you weren't just anybody.

134
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,019
You instantly figured out
my business secret.

135
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:52,986
All your business secrets
seem pretty lousy.

136
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,871
How would this put blood on the table?

137
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:04,873
And get a haircut!

138
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:07,793
What's wrong with this?

139
00:11:08,043 --> 00:11:09,586
Did the soy sauce go bad?

140
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,796
Now listen.

141
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:16,676
I'm going to ask you a question,

142
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,512
and you'll speak the absolute truth.

143
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:21,056
The gold in the basement of the mansion.

144
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:23,183
You took it, didn't you?

145
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:26,353
What are you talking about?

146
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:27,687
Here.

147
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:29,815
I even have evidence,

148
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:31,566
so don't think about denying it.

149
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:34,986
I have no idea what you're talking about.

150
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:37,572
You coaxed the innocent Woo-hyeol

151
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:40,200
into believing that he could become human
after sleeping for 100 years.

152
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:41,326
And while he was asleep,

153
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:44,037
you took all the gold in the basement.

154
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:47,332
This whisker proves that you were there.

155
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:53,755
You're right.

156
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:56,258
I was in the basement.

157
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,428
Sit down.

158
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:00,554
However,

159
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:03,682
the gold isn't what's important to me.

160
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:06,560
Seon Woo-hyeol.

161
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:10,439
I went down there to check on him.

162
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:25,162
Woo-hyeol is like a soft-boiled egg.

163
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:27,831
He's not entirely a vampire or human,

164
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:28,957
but something in between.

165
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,963
Didn't you sense something strange?

166
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:37,257
Woo-hyeol has always been strange.

167
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:40,677
There's nothing normal
about a vampire wanting to be human.

168
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:44,806
He's living the most crucial but also
the most dangerous time of his life.

169
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:47,559
And he needs your help.

170
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:51,188
Did something happen to him?

171
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:00,030
A soft-boiled egg
can end up a hard-boiled egg,

172
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:02,824
but a chick can't hatch from it.

173
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:06,203
A chick?

174
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:07,537
What is he saying?

175
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:10,624
What do you mean by that?

176
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:12,000
Why would he...

177
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:15,003
Did he say he wanted to be a chick?

178
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:17,422
How dare you speak that way
about Woo-hyeol?!

179
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:20,175
Stop being so dramatic and sit down.

180
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:21,760
Keep an eye on Woo-hyeol.

181
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,471
And let me know
if anything is out of the ordinary.

182
00:13:42,948 --> 00:13:44,991
I could've come to your office.

183
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:46,618
I'm cooped up in there all day.

184
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:48,245
I called you out to get some air.

185
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,332
Did you get home safely last night?

186
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:53,250
Yes.

187
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,167
Right.

188
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:56,461
How's Mr. Seon?

189
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,965
He was completely out of it
even though he barely had any alcohol.

190
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:01,883
I know.

191
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:05,387
I had no idea he'd get that wasted.

192
00:14:05,971 --> 00:14:07,597
Let me apologize on his behalf.

193
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:08,723
I'm sorry.

194
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:10,559
You're not the one who should apologize.

195
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:12,227
It wasn't your fault.

196
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,604
I guess.

197
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:17,983
It wasn't my fault.

198
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:20,235
Right.

199
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:23,780
I wanted to talk to you
about the remodeling.

200
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:24,906
I see.

201
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:27,742
I'll speed up the process

202
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:29,995
by putting together a crew of veterans.

203
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:32,622
But because the house is old,

204
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:35,292
it'll take a while to fix things up.

205
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:37,127
How long?

206
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:40,422
It'll probably take at least a week.

207
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:41,923
I see.

208
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,553
There's an apartment
the company is renting,

209
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:47,637
and it's vacant.

210
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:50,223
How about you stay there?

211
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:52,100
Well...

212
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:56,855
Sure, that sounds good.

213
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:57,939
Really?

214
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:01,192
Every penny counts these days.

215
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,362
I decided to turn to you for help,

216
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:05,947
so I'll do just that

217
00:15:06,031 --> 00:15:07,699
and make up for it later.

218
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:12,078
I'm happy to hear you say that.

219
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:14,998
I'll set things up for you then.

220
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,875
Thank you.

221
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:23,673
DAEBAK BUTCHER SHOP

222
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:24,883
Welcome.

223
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,222
I need ox blood to cure my hangover.

224
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:34,059
Please give me some ox blood.

225
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:37,937
I see you were binge drinking.

226
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:40,523
Hold on.

227
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:53,370
Have a good day.

228
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:01,378
How frugal.

229
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:03,380
I'd just buy myself
a bowl of ox blood soup.

230
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:27,654
Who shall this be?

231
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:30,615
I don't need to hear more
to know who it is.

232
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:34,452
It's me, Na Hae-won.

233
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:35,787
I see.

234
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:37,706
You seemed fairly drunk last night.

235
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:38,832
Are you all right?

236
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,835
Yes, I'm fine.

237
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:45,088
How did you get this number?

238
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:48,758
I'm not one to stay in debt,
so I asked Do-sik.

239
00:16:49,718 --> 00:16:50,885
You're in debt?

240
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:52,637
How much?

241
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:54,764
You saved my life yesterday.

242
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:56,057
Don't you remember?

243
00:16:56,141 --> 00:16:57,058
Right.

244
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,185
I only did what anyone would've done.

245
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:00,812
That being said,

246
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,440
I'd like to express my gratitude
with a gift.

247
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:04,607
Are you free tomorrow?

248
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,735
Hey.

249
00:17:10,447 --> 00:17:12,741
Yes, I'm free all day.

250
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:16,077
I'll text you the time and address.

251
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:16,995
See you tomorrow.

252
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:18,538
All right.

253
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:21,541
You get calls now?

254
00:17:22,751 --> 00:17:24,753
- It was Ms. Na.
- Ms. Na?

255
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:26,212
Why? What did she say?

256
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:29,340
She has a gift for me and wants to meet.

257
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:30,633
A gift?

258
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:31,926
Shall we?

259
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:33,219
What...

260
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:41,853
Is it true?

261
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,439
It wasn't you who called her?

262
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:46,608
She's the one who called you first?

263
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:47,650
Yes.

264
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:49,611
She thanked me for saving her yesterday.

265
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,697
She said she couldn't stand being in debt

266
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:54,574
and must repay me.

267
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:55,950
I see.

268
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:58,787
She's nothing like someone I know
who doesn't mind being in debt.

269
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:01,331
I hope you didn't forget about the IOU.

270
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,082
I'll pay you back, all right?

271
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,834
And until I do,

272
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:06,795
you'll make me work without paying me.

273
00:18:07,462 --> 00:18:08,963
I'm glad you're aware of it.

274
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:11,633
The renovation will begin tomorrow.

275
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:14,552
Do-sik will find us a place to stay
until it's over,

276
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:16,304
so pack what you need.

277
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:18,890
Me too?

278
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:20,767
We'll be staying together?

279
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:23,144
Do you have someplace else to stay?

280
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:26,689
I decline.

281
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:28,274
I'll be on my own.

282
00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:30,485
But you don't even have a place to stay.

283
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:32,987
Of course I do. I have plenty.

284
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,700
Don't tell me you're going to your friends
that I met last time.

285
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:39,118
Yes.

286
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:40,829
Well...

287
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:44,374
It'll be nice to catch up
since it's been a while.

288
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:45,875
I'll stay with them,

289
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:48,378
so don't worry about me

290
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:51,756
and enjoy some time alone with Do-sik.

291
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:53,883
Don't be ridiculous.

292
00:18:54,217 --> 00:18:56,344
It's not like I'm going there to party.

293
00:18:56,678 --> 00:18:59,639
If I had known,
I would've just opted to stay elsewhere.

294
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:02,517
Why won't you go
when I arranged everything for you?

295
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,812
Wouldn't it be more comfortable
without me around?

296
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:07,605
The same goes for me too.

297
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:12,443
Fine then.

298
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:14,988
Right.

299
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:18,283
And watch yourself in front of Ms. Na.

300
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:20,618
I won't forgive you if you mess up.

301
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:38,303
It's not like I wanted him to come.

302
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:41,723
What? Enjoy our time alone?

303
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:45,977
Says the guy who's over the moon
about receiving a gift.

304
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:56,946
Do you think we patrol because we want to?

305
00:19:57,155 --> 00:20:00,450
We wouldn't be doing this
if the area had been redeveloped.

306
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:02,869
That hideous mansion

307
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:04,787
has been causing everyone so much trouble.

308
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:07,582
There were talks of redevelopment?

309
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:10,585
Yes, but the owner of the mansion
adamantly refused to sell his property

310
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:11,502
so it never happened.

311
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:14,422
What's so special about this old house?

312
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:19,761
I wouldn't be this frustrated
if I at least knew

313
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:22,764
if you were dead or alive.

314
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:52,543
Why

315
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:56,172
do I only see my reflection
in Butler Joo's eyes?

316
00:20:58,341 --> 00:20:59,968
Could it have something to do

317
00:21:01,219 --> 00:21:02,595
with her opening the coffin?

318
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,415
- Hey.
- The weather's good.

319
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:32,041
How about we go for a drive?

320
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,042
I have plans.

321
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:34,335
What plans?

322
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:37,588
I have a date with a handsome lunatic.

323
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:39,424
A handsome lunatic?

324
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:40,383
Yes.

325
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:41,801
So don't call me today.

326
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:43,052
I'll be busy. Bye.

327
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:52,103
Strangely enough, he's been on my mind.

328
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:54,772
He must be good-looking.

329
00:21:55,023 --> 00:21:57,442
He lives in that mansion.

330
00:21:58,067 --> 00:21:59,318
Talk about coincidence.

331
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:01,571
Damn it.

332
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:17,670
Mr. Seon.

333
00:22:33,061 --> 00:22:34,103
Did you wait for long?

334
00:22:36,314 --> 00:22:37,482
No.

335
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:39,609
I just got here myself.

336
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:41,027
Shall we head inside?

337
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:02,548
It really is Seon Woo-hyeol.

338
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:09,555
Do you like paintings?

339
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:14,477
I love to paint,

340
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:16,354
but it's my first time

341
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:19,607
seeing other people's works.

342
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:21,526
Do you paint?

343
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,532
In my younger years,

344
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:29,826
I was told I was gifted.

345
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:32,328
Bees and butterflies

346
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:35,206
would gently rest on my paintings.

347
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:39,877
I'd love to see your paintings.

348
00:23:50,263 --> 00:23:51,389
Don't move.

349
00:23:58,187 --> 00:23:59,522
I told you not to move.

350
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:16,455
I've been meaning to ask,

351
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:20,835
but why do you look at me that way?

352
00:24:22,837 --> 00:24:26,132
Why do you look at me so longingly

353
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:29,802
as if I'm someone from your past?

354
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,394
There seems to be

355
00:24:39,729 --> 00:24:41,272
a misunderstanding.

356
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:43,691
You've been doing that ever since we met.

357
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:46,027
It bothers me.

358
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:56,954
I still don't see

359
00:24:57,788 --> 00:24:58,956
my reflection in her eyes.

360
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:03,252
Do I look like the woman named Hae-sun
that you keep mentioning?

361
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:07,465
No.

362
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:12,011
I'm often told

363
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:15,932
that I have expressive eyes.

364
00:25:18,935 --> 00:25:20,144
Please don't think much of it.

365
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:36,577
This is pretty.

366
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:43,751
Don't they look like stars in bloom?

367
00:25:52,718 --> 00:25:54,512
Doesn't it look like a star in bloom?

368
00:26:01,602 --> 00:26:04,146
I'd like to buy this for you as a gift.

369
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:08,943
Hang it somewhere appropriate
when the guest house is renovated.

370
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:12,113
I hope it fits the new place.

371
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:24,834
Do-sik,

372
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:26,669
how much does this place cost per...

373
00:26:29,005 --> 00:26:30,047
Forget it.

374
00:26:30,381 --> 00:26:33,426
I wouldn't be able to stay here if I knew,

375
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:34,677
so I won't ask.

376
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,512
Good. I like that attitude.

377
00:26:36,846 --> 00:26:39,056
It'll be vacant if not for you,

378
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,182
so don't feel burdened.

379
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:42,226
Okay.

380
00:26:42,852 --> 00:26:45,062
I'll wait in the lobby,
so join me after you unpack.

381
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:47,982
I made a reservation
at a restaurant nearby.

382
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:49,066
I see.

383
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,526
Okay, I'll be right down.

384
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:51,736
- All right.
- Yes.

385
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:09,545
It's so nice here.

386
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:24,810
Do-sik.

387
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:28,397
I've never eaten
at an expensive restaurant like this

388
00:27:28,481 --> 00:27:29,982
that serves tiny portions.

389
00:27:31,275 --> 00:27:32,109
Enjoy.

390
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:35,529
Thank you.

391
00:27:38,324 --> 00:27:39,575
By the way,

392
00:27:39,784 --> 00:27:42,286
will Mr. Seon really be all right?

393
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:44,663
He's staying with his friends.

394
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:47,291
I see.

395
00:27:48,209 --> 00:27:49,919
Will he stay at the guest house

396
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:52,171
even after it opens for business?

397
00:27:53,631 --> 00:27:54,548
Yes.

398
00:27:54,965 --> 00:27:57,843
That'll probably be the case
until things get sorted out.

399
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,555
The more I get to know him,
the more unusual he is.

400
00:28:02,473 --> 00:28:03,432
Sorry?

401
00:28:05,142 --> 00:28:06,936
Nothing. Let's eat.

402
00:28:11,482 --> 00:28:14,151
I'm not trying to scare you
before the guest house even opens,

403
00:28:14,819 --> 00:28:17,071
but it won't be easy dealing with people

404
00:28:17,154 --> 00:28:18,239
while running the place.

405
00:28:19,115 --> 00:28:20,199
I hope you're ready for that.

406
00:28:20,658 --> 00:28:21,951
Of course.

407
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:23,911
I've worked all kinds of part-time jobs.

408
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:25,538
You're right.

409
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:26,455
Do you remember?

410
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:30,376
I often ate at the restaurant
you worked at.

411
00:28:30,835 --> 00:28:33,170
You're right. I remember.

412
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:37,675
You came by with a different friend
almost every day.

413
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:38,759
I did.

414
00:28:41,262 --> 00:28:43,347
I envied you back then.

415
00:28:44,515 --> 00:28:46,267
Me? Why?

416
00:28:47,393 --> 00:28:50,604
You could afford to eat
the steak there almost every day.

417
00:28:51,147 --> 00:28:53,524
I assumed you were loaded.

418
00:28:55,693 --> 00:28:58,821
Was the steak that delicious?

419
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:00,364
To be honest, it was bad.

420
00:29:00,823 --> 00:29:02,366
I didn't even want to touch it in the end.

421
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:03,784
Really?

422
00:29:04,577 --> 00:29:05,995
Then why...

423
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:07,246
I went there to see you.

424
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:13,377
You didn't know?

425
00:29:14,837 --> 00:29:15,671
No way.

426
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:19,508
Why else would I have eaten
at that mediocre restaurant so often?

427
00:29:19,842 --> 00:29:20,718
You really didn't know?

428
00:29:21,469 --> 00:29:22,720
This is frustrating.

429
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:28,100
Do you remember attending to my wound
after I fell off my bicycle?

430
00:29:30,311 --> 00:29:32,188
Yes, I remember that.

431
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:37,151
You tried to hold me accountable
a few days later.

432
00:29:44,658 --> 00:29:45,743
You two go ahead.

433
00:29:51,749 --> 00:29:52,750
We meet again.

434
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:55,586
I'm the bicycle guy.

435
00:29:56,504 --> 00:29:57,505
Right.

436
00:29:58,672 --> 00:29:59,924
How's your hand?

437
00:30:01,884 --> 00:30:04,136
I think it's going to leave a scar.

438
00:30:04,762 --> 00:30:06,639
- I'll have to hold you responsible.
- Sorry?

439
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:09,099
Let's eat lunch together until it heals.

440
00:30:10,351 --> 00:30:11,769
Bring me a doctor's note then.

441
00:30:19,944 --> 00:30:21,612
You have no idea how embarrassed I was.

442
00:30:23,781 --> 00:30:26,367
You can be really scary
when you speak with a straight face.

443
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:27,910
Really?

444
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:30,037
I couldn't ask you out after that.

445
00:30:32,915 --> 00:30:35,000
CENTRAL LIBRARY

446
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:36,335
In-hae.

447
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:38,295
Hey, Do-sik.

448
00:30:38,379 --> 00:30:39,421
Let's go eat.

449
00:30:39,505 --> 00:30:40,381
It'll be on me.

450
00:30:40,464 --> 00:30:42,841
I have a part-time job to get to.

451
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:52,768
You have no idea how scary
your tone and expression were.

452
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:55,229
I still have nightmares.

453
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,148
Oh, come on.

454
00:31:02,278 --> 00:31:04,029
I didn't think I'd ever see you again.

455
00:31:05,781 --> 00:31:07,366
It's nice being here with you.

456
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:14,707
Reconnecting with you
sent me back in time.

457
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:18,002
I'm having fun, and I feel excited.

458
00:31:21,547 --> 00:31:24,008
I want to see you smile more.

459
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:27,386
I want to make it happen.

460
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:29,680
I mean it.

461
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:49,575
We should go for a drive out of town
if you're free tomorrow.

462
00:31:51,118 --> 00:31:52,953
You'd be bored cooped up inside.

463
00:31:53,704 --> 00:31:56,707
It'd be nice to get some fresh air
at a nice cafe.

464
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:57,625
What do you say?

465
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:00,210
Do-sik.

466
00:32:02,004 --> 00:32:04,048
You said earlier

467
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:07,676
that you want to see me smile more.

468
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:10,512
I feel the same way.

469
00:32:11,055 --> 00:32:12,890
I want the guest house to be a success

470
00:32:12,973 --> 00:32:15,684
so that you and Ms. Na can also be happy.

471
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,690
I understand your feelings for me,

472
00:32:21,774 --> 00:32:24,943
but I want to focus my time
on the guest house for now.

473
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:30,032
I think that's what I should do
to repay everyone for helping me.

474
00:32:35,496 --> 00:32:36,914
I didn't want anything in return.

475
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:40,918
But if that's how you feel...

476
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:43,045
All right, I hear you.

477
00:32:45,339 --> 00:32:47,174
You're quite ambitious, Ms. Joo.

478
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:48,884
It'll be a success,

479
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:50,552
and I'll keep helping.

480
00:32:52,346 --> 00:32:53,472
Thanks, Do-sik.

481
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:54,515
I mean it.

482
00:32:55,224 --> 00:32:56,266
Shall we go?

483
00:33:21,417 --> 00:33:23,627
I've been meaning to ask,

484
00:33:24,044 --> 00:33:25,838
but why do you look at me that way?

485
00:33:26,797 --> 00:33:30,134
Why do you look at me so longingly

486
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,804
as if I'm someone from your past?

487
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:40,936
Woo-hyeol.

488
00:33:43,856 --> 00:33:44,982
Are you just getting back?

489
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:47,317
Is something up?

490
00:33:48,861 --> 00:33:50,195
I'll have to put you out.

491
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:51,488
- What?
- What?

492
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,324
I'm glad you came.

493
00:33:54,408 --> 00:33:56,452
Make yourself at home,
and enjoy your stay.

494
00:33:56,744 --> 00:33:58,620
All right. Thanks, Dong-seop.

495
00:33:59,413 --> 00:34:03,000
Why did you have to come
to this tiny rooftop house?

496
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:07,588
Can you move?

497
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,634
It's cramped as is.

498
00:34:15,095 --> 00:34:16,305
I just had these washed.

499
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:19,933
Won't you be better off
staying at the place he provided?

500
00:34:20,142 --> 00:34:21,477
It'd be best for everyone.

501
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,061
You don't seem to understand.

502
00:34:23,145 --> 00:34:24,480
I need to be gone

503
00:34:24,855 --> 00:34:27,816
for the two of them
to spend more time alone.

504
00:34:31,028 --> 00:34:35,115
I wonder if that Do-sik guy
is making the right moves.

505
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:38,202
But it's not like I can ask him.

506
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:41,497
Anyway, how was it for you?

507
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:45,417
You met her
for the first time in 400 years.

508
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:49,171
She asked

509
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:51,965
why I kept looking at her so longingly.

510
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:56,220
But I couldn't tell her the truth.

511
00:34:57,054 --> 00:34:58,055
I couldn't say

512
00:34:58,972 --> 00:35:01,725
that I waited for her for 400 years.

513
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:08,023
Let's drink.

514
00:35:18,992 --> 00:35:20,661
Butler Joo told me

515
00:35:21,578 --> 00:35:23,664
not to see her as Hae-sun

516
00:35:24,373 --> 00:35:26,083
but as Hae-won who she is today.

517
00:35:27,835 --> 00:35:29,628
However, it's easier said than done.

518
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:31,380
That Butler Joo.

519
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:34,216
Who gives her the right
to tell you what to do

520
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:36,176
when she's the reason
you failed to become human?

521
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,219
Damn it.

522
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,807
I don't know if it's the right moment
to say this, but...

523
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,350
You're going to anyway.

524
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:44,476
We finally

525
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,979
got to see Mr. Ko in the flesh.

526
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:49,439
Mr. Ko?

527
00:35:49,523 --> 00:35:51,567
Although I did meet him before.

528
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,443
And he said

529
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:55,112
that you are currently

530
00:35:55,195 --> 00:35:58,031
in the most crucial
but dangerous moment of your life.

531
00:35:59,992 --> 00:36:01,660
He said that to you two as well?

532
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:05,289
Then again,

533
00:36:05,372 --> 00:36:07,708
I'm sure he's worried.

534
00:36:07,958 --> 00:36:10,711
He said we should keep an eye on you.

535
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:12,129
There's nothing wrong, is there?

536
00:36:12,963 --> 00:36:14,464
Everything's good. I'm fine.

537
00:36:16,717 --> 00:36:19,636
I apologize for making you two worry.

538
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:21,388
Please don't apologize.

539
00:36:21,471 --> 00:36:23,557
We just want you to become human
as soon as possible

540
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,309
so that you can be happy.

541
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:27,728
You know we're always on your side, right?

542
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:29,563
Come here.

543
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:30,689
What...

544
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:33,317
Not among vampires, damn it.

545
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,610
My brothers!

546
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:36,862
Boys, at least let me breathe.

547
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:40,157
- You... All right.
- My brothers.

548
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:41,742
I get it!

549
00:36:42,993 --> 00:36:43,911
Are you crying?

550
00:36:58,175 --> 00:37:00,344
I wonder how his date with Ms. Na went.

551
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:05,307
Does he actually have a place to stay?

552
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:10,354
Whatever.

553
00:37:10,437 --> 00:37:11,605
I'm sure he's fine.

554
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:31,541
These little punks.

555
00:37:37,631 --> 00:37:38,715
These little...

556
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:50,602
You must be doing fine.

557
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:57,442
Do-sik must've treated you
to a fine meal at a nice place,

558
00:37:57,734 --> 00:37:59,987
and now you're enjoying
each other's company.

559
00:38:01,822 --> 00:38:05,534
Your heart will soon
be bursting with love.

560
00:38:08,745 --> 00:38:09,788
Finally...

561
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:12,457
Finally.

562
00:38:14,418 --> 00:38:15,460
Finally.

563
00:38:33,103 --> 00:38:35,147
How did it go with Ms. Na today?

564
00:38:35,439 --> 00:38:36,815
I hope you didn't slip up.

565
00:38:55,042 --> 00:38:55,876
Are you asleep?

566
00:39:04,176 --> 00:39:05,594
BUTLER JOO

567
00:39:09,139 --> 00:39:10,057
Hello?

568
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:17,189
Hello?

569
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,691
Why aren't you saying anything?

570
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,234
Right.

571
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:23,737
Well...

572
00:39:25,572 --> 00:39:26,698
What are you up to?

573
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:28,158
Me?

574
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:30,744
I was about to go to sleep.

575
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:32,871
But I can't seem to
because I'm not used to the place.

576
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:35,457
Is the place all right for you?

577
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:37,375
Of course. It's amazing here.

578
00:39:37,459 --> 00:39:38,460
It's spacious and clean.

579
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:41,755
Do-sik must've pulled out
all the stops for you.

580
00:39:42,631 --> 00:39:45,133
You should've just come with me
when I asked.

581
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:46,843
Is your friends' place that nice?

582
00:39:46,927 --> 00:39:48,011
Here?

583
00:39:48,929 --> 00:39:50,889
It's great. The view is spectacular.

584
00:39:51,431 --> 00:39:53,975
I can see all of Seoul.

585
00:39:55,852 --> 00:39:56,853
Really?

586
00:39:58,146 --> 00:40:00,190
Your friends must live somewhere nice

587
00:40:00,273 --> 00:40:01,691
despite not seeming that well off.

588
00:40:01,775 --> 00:40:02,776
What?

589
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:05,987
It's not right
to judge a book by its cover.

590
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,867
So how did it go with Ms. Na?

591
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:12,953
Was there another mishap?

592
00:40:13,036 --> 00:40:13,954
Right.

593
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:16,540
Well...

594
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:21,169
I abided by all your rules.

595
00:40:21,545 --> 00:40:23,421
I didn't refer to her as Hae-sun,

596
00:40:24,047 --> 00:40:25,799
didn't make physical contact,

597
00:40:26,383 --> 00:40:28,760
didn't eat any human food,
and parted ways before dark.

598
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:30,971
Well done.

599
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:34,057
And here I was worried
about you slipping up again.

600
00:40:34,391 --> 00:40:35,433
What...

601
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:38,103
did you just say?

602
00:40:38,186 --> 00:40:39,229
What?

603
00:40:39,312 --> 00:40:41,648
That I was worried about you slipping up.

604
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:44,484
No, before that.

605
00:40:44,568 --> 00:40:45,527
Well done.

606
00:40:48,405 --> 00:40:49,489
That's nice to hear.

607
00:40:51,283 --> 00:40:53,285
I'm glad to hear...

608
00:40:54,244 --> 00:40:56,121
you're someplace nice.

609
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:59,082
One would think
I'll be staying abroad for months.

610
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:00,876
It's only been a day.

611
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:02,752
Time is a relative concept.

612
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:05,130
100 years could feel like a day

613
00:41:05,213 --> 00:41:07,632
while a day could feel like 100 years.

614
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:24,983
You're coming
to the mansion tomorrow, right?

615
00:41:25,609 --> 00:41:26,693
Of course.

616
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:30,989
I can't let them completely
knock down my perfectly fine house.

617
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:32,949
Good night then.

618
00:41:33,033 --> 00:41:33,909
I'll see you tomorrow.

619
00:41:34,242 --> 00:41:35,118
You too.

620
00:41:37,913 --> 00:41:38,788
Good night.

621
00:42:23,959 --> 00:42:25,085
You're here early.

622
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:29,923
My longing kept me up all night.

623
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:35,679
For the mansion, I mean.

624
00:42:38,181 --> 00:42:39,516
I've never been away from it.

625
00:42:39,933 --> 00:42:41,351
It must've grown on me too.

626
00:42:41,768 --> 00:42:44,646
Where I'm staying is nicer and cleaner,
but I had trouble sleeping.

627
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:46,690
I came as soon as I woke up.

628
00:42:57,826 --> 00:42:59,077
- What?
- What?

629
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:06,835
Excuse me.

630
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:09,379
Is this Mr. Seon Woo-hyeol's house?

631
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:11,256
Yes, I'm Seon Woo-hyeol.

632
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:13,508
Could you please sign
the change of ownership form?

633
00:43:14,884 --> 00:43:15,927
What's this?

634
00:43:16,011 --> 00:43:17,220
What change of ownership?

635
00:43:17,637 --> 00:43:19,556
What on earth are you taking over?

636
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:22,309
Here.

637
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:23,810
The painting is in the car.

638
00:43:24,227 --> 00:43:26,896
And the car is also a gift from Ms. Na.

639
00:43:32,444 --> 00:43:35,572
So the gift Ms. Na
was giving you was a car?

640
00:43:40,702 --> 00:43:41,745
Is it this?

641
00:43:42,579 --> 00:43:43,538
There it is.

642
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:48,168
The painting is the gift,

643
00:43:48,251 --> 00:43:49,294
and I guess the car...

644
00:43:50,712 --> 00:43:51,963
is a bonus.

645
00:43:53,465 --> 00:43:54,549
No way.

646
00:43:58,011 --> 00:43:59,012
Hello?

647
00:43:59,346 --> 00:44:01,848
Mr. Seon, did you get the gift I sent?

648
00:44:02,057 --> 00:44:04,059
The painting arrived in a car.

649
00:44:06,936 --> 00:44:09,773
You'll need a car to run a guest house.

650
00:44:09,856 --> 00:44:10,982
Please use it as needed.

651
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:12,817
Thank you.

652
00:44:13,193 --> 00:44:16,404
I feel reassured
to have such a supportive investor.

653
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,073
It's really nothing.

654
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:20,658
I'll stop by
once the renovation is complete.

655
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:21,993
Goodbye then.

656
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:24,496
This is insane.

657
00:44:24,954 --> 00:44:27,457
She might buy you a house
the next time you save her.

658
00:44:29,959 --> 00:44:31,586
Did I accept it too easily?

659
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:33,213
No, it's for the best.

660
00:44:33,963 --> 00:44:36,466
You can pay back your debt
by selling this.

661
00:44:37,092 --> 00:44:38,885
I guess I'll post it on Dangun Market.

662
00:44:39,594 --> 00:44:41,554
Sell what? No way.

663
00:44:42,138 --> 00:44:43,723
It was a gift from Hae-sun...

664
00:44:45,225 --> 00:44:46,351
How can you sell the car

665
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:49,771
our investor gave us
for the smooth running of the guest house?

666
00:44:50,271 --> 00:44:52,649
Simply owning a car isn't the end of it.

667
00:44:52,941 --> 00:44:56,820
You need to pay for gas, insurance, tax,
as well as other maintenance costs.

668
00:44:57,195 --> 00:44:59,072
How can we afford it all?

669
00:45:02,617 --> 00:45:03,910
Since it was a gift,

670
00:45:03,993 --> 00:45:06,413
I'll ask Ms. Na to take care of all that.

671
00:45:06,496 --> 00:45:07,664
Are you out of your mind?

672
00:45:08,665 --> 00:45:10,708
We need a car for the guest house

673
00:45:10,792 --> 00:45:13,670
if we're to go grocery shopping
or pick up guests.

674
00:45:14,337 --> 00:45:15,380
Also...

675
00:45:17,215 --> 00:45:18,091
I look great with it.

676
00:45:24,389 --> 00:45:25,515
All right then.

677
00:45:25,765 --> 00:45:27,016
Do you have a license?

678
00:45:28,351 --> 00:45:30,145
I had a car since 100 years ago,

679
00:45:30,228 --> 00:45:34,065
but it was Butler Joo
who drove it back then.

680
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:37,735
Cut the nonsense
and get a driver's license.

681
00:45:39,863 --> 00:45:41,614
Keep checking the rearview mirror.

682
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:44,033
- You're driving too close to the line.
- Right.

683
00:45:44,367 --> 00:45:46,536
- Stay in the center.
- In the center?

684
00:45:47,245 --> 00:45:48,830
You're worrying me.

685
00:45:49,164 --> 00:45:50,790
- Signal a right turn.
- Right.

686
00:45:51,332 --> 00:45:52,417
- The right?
- Yes.

687
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:55,086
DRIVING LESSON IN SESSION

688
00:46:16,399 --> 00:46:19,068
I suggest this for the guest house.

689
00:46:19,652 --> 00:46:22,822
You can design this separately, right?

690
00:46:22,906 --> 00:46:23,740
Yes, of course.

691
00:46:24,032 --> 00:46:26,075
As for...

692
00:46:30,997 --> 00:46:34,626
SHADED OASIS GUEST HOUSE

693
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:47,222
Are you sure you learned how to drive?

694
00:46:47,305 --> 00:46:48,389
Why do you look so uncomfortable?

695
00:46:48,473 --> 00:46:50,141
Of course I'm ready.

696
00:46:51,059 --> 00:46:53,853
It's just that cars these days
have a lot of buttons.

697
00:46:54,604 --> 00:46:58,024
Maybe you should slow down.
We're not in a hurry.

698
00:46:58,107 --> 00:47:01,277
Slow down? But I'm below the speed limit.

699
00:47:01,361 --> 00:47:02,695
As if.

700
00:47:02,987 --> 00:47:03,988
My gosh!

701
00:47:06,366 --> 00:47:09,118
Who slams down on the brakes like that?

702
00:47:09,202 --> 00:47:10,453
How else should one hit them?

703
00:47:11,287 --> 00:47:13,414
If you're not happy
with my driving, take over.

704
00:47:13,498 --> 00:47:15,625
I don't have a license!

705
00:47:16,417 --> 00:47:18,127
- Jeez.
- My goodness.

706
00:47:21,256 --> 00:47:23,550
You're doing fine.

707
00:47:24,509 --> 00:47:25,927
So...

708
00:47:26,594 --> 00:47:28,721
how does it feel
to drive after all these years?

709
00:47:28,805 --> 00:47:31,558
Well, I'm very comfortable.

710
00:47:31,641 --> 00:47:33,017
Absolutely comfortable.

711
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:36,479
I'm one of the best drivers out there.

712
00:47:37,021 --> 00:47:39,274
My goodness, you sound old-fashioned
even when you brag.

713
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:41,818
What about you then?

714
00:47:41,901 --> 00:47:44,696
How do you feel about finally
opening the guest house?

715
00:47:45,029 --> 00:47:46,114
- Me?
- Yes.

716
00:47:46,197 --> 00:47:47,574
I'm not sure.

717
00:47:47,657 --> 00:47:50,451
It hasn't really sunk in yet.

718
00:47:51,578 --> 00:47:52,704
What about you?

719
00:47:52,996 --> 00:47:55,623
- Running a business--
- Hang on. I'm getting a call.

720
00:47:58,042 --> 00:47:59,210
Hello?

721
00:47:59,419 --> 00:48:01,796
Hey, Do-sik. We're on our way back.

722
00:48:02,714 --> 00:48:04,340
Please. We owe it all to you.

723
00:48:17,312 --> 00:48:19,772
What a stylish transformation. I like it.

724
00:48:21,065 --> 00:48:22,483
Let's do well.

725
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:33,119
Let's get to work.

726
00:48:43,421 --> 00:48:46,215
SHADED OASIS GUEST HOUSE

727
00:48:54,974 --> 00:48:57,185
The renovation was disturbing
the whole neighborhood.

728
00:48:57,268 --> 00:48:58,978
Is it complete?

729
00:48:59,062 --> 00:49:00,021
It sure is.

730
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:02,565
Then can we take a look inside?

731
00:49:03,816 --> 00:49:04,817
Be my guest.

732
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:09,197
- Check out the sign. It's nice.
- Goodness.

733
00:49:09,572 --> 00:49:10,823
It'd look better at night.

734
00:49:17,497 --> 00:49:18,873
Oh, my.

735
00:49:19,248 --> 00:49:20,667
What do you think?

736
00:49:21,876 --> 00:49:23,086
Welcome.

737
00:49:23,336 --> 00:49:24,295
Here you go.

738
00:49:24,379 --> 00:49:25,838
I hope we continue to get along.

739
00:49:26,798 --> 00:49:28,049
You bought rice cakes?

740
00:49:28,466 --> 00:49:29,592
These look delicious.

741
00:49:30,176 --> 00:49:32,470
So the guest house is called Shaded Oasis?

742
00:49:33,221 --> 00:49:35,890
What a peculiar name.

743
00:49:37,016 --> 00:49:39,310
I want this place to be

744
00:49:39,769 --> 00:49:41,562
a shelter from the sun.

745
00:49:42,605 --> 00:49:43,690
Hence the name.

746
00:49:44,357 --> 00:49:45,441
I see.

747
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:47,652
What's with the name?

748
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:51,197
The concept is quite unique.

749
00:49:52,699 --> 00:49:54,867
Wait. Check out that antique.

750
00:49:55,368 --> 00:49:57,245
How old is this?

751
00:49:57,495 --> 00:49:58,830
Don't...

752
00:49:58,913 --> 00:50:01,708
Don't touch and just look.

753
00:50:01,958 --> 00:50:03,418
Everything here is of great value.

754
00:50:03,918 --> 00:50:07,046
I see no one sent flowers for the opening.

755
00:50:07,547 --> 00:50:10,174
- It feels a little empty here.
- You're right, it does.

756
00:50:10,925 --> 00:50:12,468
Connections are crucial
in running a business.

757
00:50:12,552 --> 00:50:13,845
I'm feeling generous.

758
00:50:14,178 --> 00:50:15,096
Let me get you one.

759
00:50:15,513 --> 00:50:16,472
Right.

760
00:50:16,889 --> 00:50:17,932
Is anyone home?

761
00:50:21,102 --> 00:50:22,603
- Are you Ms. Joo In-hae?
- Yes.

762
00:50:22,687 --> 00:50:25,022
Mr. Shin Do-sik sent this.
Where should I put it?

763
00:50:25,732 --> 00:50:27,608
Over there please.

764
00:50:27,692 --> 00:50:30,153
CONGRATULATIONS
ON THE OPENING OF SHADED OASIS

765
00:50:30,862 --> 00:50:32,864
I can't believe him.

766
00:50:32,947 --> 00:50:34,365
He shouldn't have.

767
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:38,035
There should at least be two of them
so it looks more complete.

768
00:50:38,119 --> 00:50:39,078
Right.

769
00:50:39,162 --> 00:50:40,621
Are Ms. Joo In-hae
and Mr. Seon Woo-hyeol here?

770
00:50:40,705 --> 00:50:41,914
Yes, that's us.

771
00:50:41,998 --> 00:50:43,750
This is from Ms. Na Hae-won.

772
00:50:44,709 --> 00:50:46,377
- Can I leave it here?
- Yes, please.

773
00:50:46,461 --> 00:50:48,296
Okay. Good luck with your business.

774
00:50:52,633 --> 00:50:54,594
It looks complete now, doesn't it?

775
00:50:56,095 --> 00:50:57,847
Let's get back to work.

776
00:50:57,930 --> 00:50:58,931
Right.

777
00:50:59,015 --> 00:51:00,933
Thanks for the rice cakes.

778
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:02,477
And congrats on the opening.

779
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,604
Thank you. Get home safely.

780
00:51:04,687 --> 00:51:05,772
Goodbye.

781
00:51:14,197 --> 00:51:17,492
Do-sik, thanks for the flowers you sent.

782
00:51:17,784 --> 00:51:21,037
Your consulting was more than enough,
but you also sent flowers.

783
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,413
Thank you so much.

784
00:51:22,747 --> 00:51:23,956
Don't mention it.

785
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:25,792
I'm glad I could help.

786
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:28,044
I'll stop by once I wrap things up.

787
00:51:28,753 --> 00:51:29,754
Congrats on the opening.

788
00:51:30,379 --> 00:51:31,339
I wish you the best.

789
00:51:50,024 --> 00:51:51,734
I know we aren't officially open yet,

790
00:51:51,818 --> 00:51:53,820
but how can absolutely no one show up?

791
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:55,863
Is this a bad sign?

792
00:51:56,656 --> 00:51:58,407
What did you expect on the first day?

793
00:52:00,076 --> 00:52:01,160
Let's be patient.

794
00:52:01,577 --> 00:52:03,037
One should know how to wait.

795
00:52:05,998 --> 00:52:07,875
I'll hand out the rest of the rice cakes,

796
00:52:07,959 --> 00:52:09,126
so get some rest.

797
00:52:09,335 --> 00:52:10,378
Okay.

798
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:12,880
Stop wiping the surfaces.
You'll wear them down.

799
00:52:13,589 --> 00:52:14,590
Rest up.

800
00:52:29,981 --> 00:52:31,774
Look into Mr. Seon for me.

801
00:52:32,525 --> 00:52:34,527
I need your objective opinion on him.

802
00:52:41,284 --> 00:52:42,994
Well, if it isn't Seon Woo-hyeol!

803
00:52:43,494 --> 00:52:45,705
- Man-hwi?
- I heard you were back.

804
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:47,707
Are you selling rice cakes now?

805
00:52:48,791 --> 00:52:52,211
I won't eat you if you give me some.

806
00:52:56,382 --> 00:52:57,383
Sure.

807
00:53:02,555 --> 00:53:03,639
Here you go.

808
00:53:03,723 --> 00:53:05,641
They say to love your enemies.

809
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:08,185
We're celebrating the guest house opening.

810
00:53:08,394 --> 00:53:09,353
A guest house?

811
00:53:10,229 --> 00:53:12,773
I guess you're not going anywhere
anytime soon.

812
00:53:15,151 --> 00:53:17,862
What has you chained to that house?

813
00:53:18,863 --> 00:53:20,197
Are you waiting for someone?

814
00:53:20,281 --> 00:53:21,407
You should go.

815
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:22,700
I have rice cakes to hand out.

816
00:53:23,117 --> 00:53:26,245
By the way,
you should beware of who you hug.

817
00:53:27,413 --> 00:53:29,624
If you keep it up,
I'll have no one to hang out with.

818
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:32,335
What do you mean by that?

819
00:53:32,418 --> 00:53:33,628
This is what you always do.

820
00:53:34,337 --> 00:53:36,714
You can't stand someone being by my side.

821
00:53:41,385 --> 00:53:43,346
Do you still think I'm the same guy

822
00:53:43,429 --> 00:53:45,431
who used to suck blood
in the corners of Shaded Oasis?

823
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,183
One can't tell by how you seem.

824
00:53:49,393 --> 00:53:52,188
Be good and stay out of trouble.

825
00:53:53,439 --> 00:53:55,483
You're just as stuck up as ever.

826
00:53:56,442 --> 00:53:58,903
Were you able to become human?

827
00:53:59,987 --> 00:54:02,198
Isn't that why you left
in the first place?

828
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,010
You failed yet again.

829
00:55:05,261 --> 00:55:06,762
You've gotten weaker.

830
00:55:38,711 --> 00:55:40,087
Welcome.

831
00:55:40,171 --> 00:55:42,089
- Do you have single rooms?
- Yes, we do.

832
00:55:42,548 --> 00:55:44,050
Do you take long-term guests?

833
00:55:44,467 --> 00:55:45,634
Long-term guests?

834
00:55:47,428 --> 00:55:49,430
What's wrong? Are they not allowed?

835
00:55:49,638 --> 00:55:50,514
Sorry?

836
00:55:50,598 --> 00:55:52,266
No, they're allowed.

837
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:54,643
It's just that this is our first day

838
00:55:55,019 --> 00:55:57,646
and we haven't thought
about long-term guests, so...

839
00:55:58,147 --> 00:56:00,691
How long do you wish to stay?

840
00:56:00,775 --> 00:56:01,859
Why so many questions?

841
00:56:02,693 --> 00:56:04,236
Can I stay or not?

842
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:06,030
You can. Of course you can.

843
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:09,033
How did you find out about this place?

844
00:56:09,492 --> 00:56:10,576
Social media?

845
00:56:15,915 --> 00:56:18,751
Shaded Oasis Guest House finally opens.

846
00:56:19,335 --> 00:56:21,587
Welcome, youngsters.

847
00:56:21,921 --> 00:56:24,340
We will be your oasis.

848
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:26,050
This...

849
00:56:26,133 --> 00:56:27,093
Isn't this the place?

850
00:56:27,927 --> 00:56:29,095
Let me show you to your room.

851
00:56:29,887 --> 00:56:30,846
This way.

852
00:56:47,238 --> 00:56:48,364
Here's your key.

853
00:56:52,451 --> 00:56:54,453
The bathroom is on the first floor.

854
00:56:55,162 --> 00:56:58,124
If you need anything or have questions,
please feel free to ask me.

855
00:56:59,208 --> 00:57:01,168
Is the security tight?

856
00:57:01,252 --> 00:57:02,378
Of course.

857
00:57:02,962 --> 00:57:04,213
You don't have to worry.

858
00:57:04,296 --> 00:57:05,798
If not, will I get my money back?

859
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:07,049
Sorry?

860
00:57:07,508 --> 00:57:08,717
Well...

861
00:57:09,635 --> 00:57:10,511
Of course.

862
00:57:12,179 --> 00:57:13,139
Okay.

863
00:57:13,222 --> 00:57:14,056
Right.

864
00:57:15,558 --> 00:57:16,767
Hurry with my luggage.

865
00:57:18,227 --> 00:57:19,854
Right.

866
00:57:19,937 --> 00:57:21,438
Please make yourself at home.

867
00:57:24,233 --> 00:57:26,485
I'll close the door for you.

868
00:57:39,331 --> 00:57:40,332
Security?

869
00:57:58,350 --> 00:57:59,810
I'm off to Gongcheon-dong.

870
00:58:00,019 --> 00:58:01,604
- Mr. Shin.
- Yes?

871
00:58:01,687 --> 00:58:03,147
There's something you must see.

872
00:58:16,577 --> 00:58:17,745
Mr. Ko.

873
00:58:19,872 --> 00:58:22,499
I didn't know Shaded Oasis
would make a comeback like this.

874
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:25,669
Congrats on the opening.

875
00:58:37,014 --> 00:58:38,974
What's with your condition?

876
00:58:40,851 --> 00:58:42,144
What on earth happened?

877
00:59:00,871 --> 00:59:01,830
What's wrong?

878
00:59:02,206 --> 00:59:03,666
You're running out of time.

879
00:59:06,335 --> 00:59:08,837
What do you mean by that?

880
00:59:08,921 --> 00:59:12,549
I told you it's dangerous
to be on the border of two beings.

881
00:59:15,844 --> 00:59:18,806
REFRESH REAL ESTATE CONSULTING

882
00:59:33,612 --> 00:59:35,322
I saw it with my own two eyes.

883
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:37,533
He's not human.

884
00:59:38,993 --> 00:59:40,077
I am Seon Woo-hyeol.

885
00:59:40,411 --> 00:59:42,162
Your hand is quite cold.

886
01:00:01,056 --> 01:00:02,516
SHADED OASIS GUEST HOUSE

887
01:00:12,276 --> 01:00:13,944
Right now,

888
01:00:14,778 --> 01:00:16,864
you're like a waning moon.

889
01:00:28,792 --> 01:00:30,002
Waning?

890
01:00:30,878 --> 01:00:32,296
What do you mean by that?

891
01:00:32,504 --> 01:00:35,090
Are you saying I'll disappear...

892
01:00:38,093 --> 01:00:40,262
like a moon on the wane?

893
01:00:42,514 --> 01:00:45,017
If you don't drink her blood

894
01:00:45,225 --> 01:00:47,144
until the night of the blood moon,

895
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:52,066
you will never get to see the moon again.

896
01:00:54,026 --> 01:00:55,486
You must hurry. There isn't much time.

897
01:00:56,445 --> 01:00:57,571
Mark my words.

898
01:00:57,654 --> 01:01:00,532
You must drink her blood
that's filled with love.

899
01:01:00,949 --> 01:01:02,284
If you don't, you'll...

900
01:01:03,702 --> 01:01:04,620
die.

901
01:01:14,546 --> 01:01:15,714
I'll die?

902
01:01:18,759 --> 01:01:19,843
Me?

903
01:02:00,509 --> 01:02:03,429
HEARTBEAT

904
01:02:03,512 --> 01:02:05,013
You're not like your usual self.

905
01:02:05,097 --> 01:02:06,098
Is something up?

906
01:02:06,181 --> 01:02:07,683
I just want to get drunk tonight.

907
01:02:09,143 --> 01:02:11,186
Report back to me
down to every last detail.

908
01:02:11,270 --> 01:02:13,230
So this is where he's been hiding out.

909
01:02:13,439 --> 01:02:14,606
It's about Mr. Seon.

910
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:17,401
It seems like a sudden cardiogenic shock.

911
01:02:17,484 --> 01:02:20,028
- Mr. Shin!
- She wouldn't have opened the coffin

912
01:02:20,112 --> 01:02:21,780
