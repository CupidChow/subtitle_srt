HEARTBEAT

2
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,298
ALL CHARACTERS, NAMES,
ORGANIZATIONS, GROUPS, EVENTS,

3
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,383
AND SETTINGS ARE FICTITIOUS
AND ANIMAL SAFETY GUIDELINES WERE FOLLOWED

4
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:51,570
Hae-sun.

5
00:01:52,071 --> 00:01:53,906
Just like how you only have one heart,

6
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:59,078
you can only truly love one person.

7
00:02:00,913 --> 00:02:01,997
I...

8
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:04,083
will come find you.

9
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:07,711
And when I do,

10
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,632
let's love each other with all our hearts.

11
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:15,636
Drink my blood...

12
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:20,140
and remember me.

13
00:02:32,278 --> 00:02:34,363
What...

14
00:02:34,864 --> 00:02:37,074
What are you doing?

15
00:02:38,576 --> 00:02:39,618
No way.

16
00:02:43,122 --> 00:02:44,832
Can you put me down first?

17
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:46,959
Right now!

18
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:49,920
Oh, right.

19
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:53,591
Slow and steady!

20
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:54,758
I'm scared!

21
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:01,473
Could you...

22
00:03:02,892 --> 00:03:03,809
truly be...

23
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:12,359
Hae-sun...

24
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:15,946
I knew it.

25
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,239
All that for a drop of blood?

26
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,742
Have you lost your mind?!

27
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:26,707
I definitely felt it.

28
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,210
Feel what, you pervert?!

29
00:03:37,635 --> 00:03:41,472
HEARTBEAT
EPISODE 4

30
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:51,941
I definitely felt Hae-sun

31
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,610
in her blood.

32
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,292
No.

33
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:12,086
There's no way.

34
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:39,530
My first kiss was with a vampire?

35
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:54,378
You drank her blood?

36
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:00,050
How?

37
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:01,427
Don't tell me...

38
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,816
No, it wasn't like that.

39
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:16,775
Then how?

40
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:23,991
From here.

41
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:30,164
Her lip was bleeding.

42
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:31,373
I couldn't help myself.

43
00:05:31,457 --> 00:05:32,332
Really?

44
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:33,834
Are you saying you kissed her?

45
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:38,130
Well, it wasn't my intention,
but yes, that's what happened.

46
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:39,173
No way.

47
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:41,175
Unbelievable.

48
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,427
How can he have more game
when he's only just woken up?

49
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,678
I've never kissed anyone.

50
00:05:44,762 --> 00:05:45,846
And you never will.

51
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:48,140
Don't be silly.

52
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:55,105
What is it? Is something up?

53
00:05:58,233 --> 00:05:59,109
Well...

54
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:00,986
Have you guys

55
00:06:01,487 --> 00:06:04,656
ever seen someone's past
or glimpses of their former life

56
00:06:05,491 --> 00:06:07,326
after drinking their blood?

57
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:09,703
This sounds awfully familiar.

58
00:06:09,787 --> 00:06:12,915
- Right.
- Don't you see that in TV shows?

59
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:15,459
Seeing the past and cracking cases
after drinking blood.

60
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:16,960
You're right.

61
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:18,837
But that's only fictional.

62
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:21,048
It's never happened to me. What about you?

63
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:23,133
Drinking blood alone
is a luxury I can't afford.

64
00:06:24,802 --> 00:06:25,677
Why do you ask though?

65
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:28,013
Did you sense something in her blood?

66
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:30,849
No, it's...

67
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:33,769
I was only wondering if it could happen.

68
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,190
It's been ages
since I last drank fresh human blood,

69
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:39,650
so I must be out of it.

70
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:45,280
Who is it at this hour?

71
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:46,698
- I'll get it.
- Okay.

72
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:57,084
Hey, customer. When will you pay up?

73
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:58,168
It's been months!

74
00:06:58,252 --> 00:06:59,128
Hey.

75
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:00,379
Get inside.

76
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,005
Let go!

77
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:03,382
Woo-hyeol, help me!

78
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:05,884
I told you to pay up. You're dead meat!

79
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:09,721
It's Seon Woo-hyeol.

80
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:11,974
No way!

81
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:16,812
Woo-hyeol, is it really you?

82
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,772
I can't believe it.

83
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:20,858
Did you become human
after your 100-year slumber?

84
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:23,861
Wait.

85
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,407
You don't smell human though.

86
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:32,035
I'm afraid that's how it is.

87
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:33,620
Why? What happened?

88
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:36,081
Rose, it's a long story.

89
00:07:36,165 --> 00:07:37,207
Then keep it short.

90
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:40,043
He's half-and-half.
Half-human, half-vampire.

91
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:45,841
Woo-hyeol,

92
00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:48,468
hang in there.

93
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:50,304
There's not much I can offer, but...

94
00:07:51,597 --> 00:07:52,931
Take this.

95
00:07:57,311 --> 00:07:59,771
This is Rh-negative. It's hard to come by.

96
00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:01,732
Hey, hands off.

97
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:05,068
If you don't pay up
by the end of next week,

98
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:08,030
you can kiss your deliveries goodbye.

99
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,867
Anyway, I have backed-up orders
to take care of,

100
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,452
so we'll catch up some other time.

101
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:15,287
- I'm off. Bye!
- Sure.

102
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,538
- Bye, Rose.
- Bye.

103
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:17,581
She just left?

104
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,375
That smells delicious.

105
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:39,394
I see that Rose

106
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:42,314
is just as feisty as ever.

107
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:44,233
She's too feisty for her own good.

108
00:08:44,316 --> 00:08:46,401
She still goes dancing every night.

109
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:49,947
What's wrong about doing what she loves
with the money she earns

110
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,698
from early-morning delivery jobs?

111
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:54,243
Early-morning delivery?

112
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:57,537
Right. These days,
when you order something,

113
00:08:58,497 --> 00:09:00,707
it's delivered to your door
the next morning.

114
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,798
While delivering packages for humans,

115
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,592
she's been dropping off
packs of blood for vampires.

116
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:13,136
Enjoy.

117
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:31,738
Why don't we get in
on this early-morning delivery service?

118
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:34,157
Are you hoping to crash a truck as well?

119
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:35,534
I don't think that's a good idea.

120
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:42,666
By the way, Woo-hyeol,
what will you do now?

121
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,751
- About what?
- You must be in a tight spot

122
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:46,670
after kissing her.

123
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,588
Why don't you stay the night here?

124
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:51,091
- Should I do that?
- Yes.

125
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:53,969
What are you talking about?

126
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:55,470
Why sleep here when you have a house?

127
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:57,222
I thought I had made myself clear.

128
00:09:57,306 --> 00:09:59,641
You are to secure that house
no matter what.

129
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:03,603
Get going, Woo-hyeol.
Go home and face it head-on!

130
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:04,604
Okay.

131
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:20,329
Be a man and tell her the truth.

132
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:23,081
"I hadn't seen fresh human blood
in so long

133
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:24,916
that I completely lost control."

134
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,126
"That's all."

135
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:29,046
"I don't have any feelings
for you whatsoever."

136
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:38,263
All right.

137
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:46,188
Where were you all night?

138
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:02,371
I was out getting some fresh air.

139
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:04,915
I see you're still awake.

140
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:06,541
How can I sleep?

141
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:09,503
I'm living with a vampire
who's out for my blood.

142
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:13,298
"Out for your blood"?

143
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:16,093
When have I been out for your blood?

144
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:17,552
Just for a drop of blood,

145
00:11:18,387 --> 00:11:21,431
you didn't hesitate

146
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:23,225
to put your lips on mine!

147
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:27,020
If that isn't you being
out for my blood, what is?

148
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:31,191
I apologize for that.

149
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:34,027
But it truly wasn't intentional.

150
00:11:35,404 --> 00:11:36,571
Then what?

151
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,660
Seeing blood right before my eyes,

152
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:43,745
I ended up losing control.

153
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:48,917
In no way was I making a move on you.

154
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:50,293
What?

155
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:52,212
I...

156
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:01,680
My heart has never beaten.

157
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:04,391
Romantic feelings are unknown to me.

158
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:08,562
I am not wired to experience love
that makes my heart beat like humans do.

159
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,523
All I have

160
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:14,151
is a desire to drink blood.

161
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,281
Same here.

162
00:12:19,865 --> 00:12:21,867
All I have is a desire to earn money.

163
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:26,288
We're good then.
I'll pretend a mosquito bit my lip.

164
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:27,497
What?

165
00:12:28,457 --> 00:12:29,374
What's wrong?

166
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,001
Isn't it better for us that way?

167
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,170
A "mosquito"?

168
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:34,880
That's a bit harsh.

169
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:36,715
Mosquitoes...

170
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:38,800
are pests!

171
00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:41,386
Would you prefer being called a tick?

172
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,263
A "tick"?

173
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:44,764
If you think about it,

174
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:45,807
I'm not entirely wrong.

175
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:48,602
Clinging on to others
and sucking their blood.

176
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:49,895
That's what ticks do.

177
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:52,898
- Hey!
- What?!

178
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:53,899
You little...

179
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:55,650
You...

180
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:02,991
If you want me to treat you like a human,

181
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:05,243
get out there and earn money.

182
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:06,745
You said you wanted to become human.

183
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:09,539
Then be prepared to live like one

184
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,458
and quit acting like a mosquito.

185
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:14,211
Why aren't you answering me?

186
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:15,795
Have you actually become a mosquito?

187
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:17,464
Understood, ma'am.

188
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,143
There's no way she's Hae-sun.

189
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:32,854
Absolutely not.

190
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,464
Please enter--

191
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:03,426
The door is unlocked.

192
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,886
The door is open.

193
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,143
VAMPIRE RECORD BOOK

194
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:19,568
This is a secret book
that has been passed down in our family.

195
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,781
Let it at least be you

196
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,533
who breaks this damned curse.

197
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:00,483
Two visits a year would suffice.

198
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:01,526
Coming by this often

199
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,486
will only fatten the hospital's pocket.

200
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:07,157
My chest feels tight,

201
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,868
and it's bothering me.

202
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:13,246
Is it because of your
family's medical history?

203
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:18,001
I understand.

204
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:20,587
Your father was healthy

205
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:24,382
until he passed away from a heart attack
before turning 40.

206
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:26,718
The same goes for your grandfather.

207
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:31,556
Multiple tests show
that you're perfectly healthy,

208
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,058
but you're experiencing symptoms.

209
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:35,393
I get why you're worried.

210
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:38,355
But still, try to take it easy.

211
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:41,608
Stress can affect your health.

212
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:53,578
I got word that Ms. Na
will be coming to Korea this week.

213
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:55,747
This week?

214
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:56,873
Yes.

215
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:03,046
I'll pick her up at the airport,
so adjust my schedule accordingly.

216
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:04,255
Yes, sir.

217
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:15,225
A mosquito? A tick?

218
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:17,018
Must she be that harsh?

219
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:19,104
She's the very reason
you ended up this way.

220
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:21,356
It's strange though.

221
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:22,399
What is?

222
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:25,568
First, she was able to open the coffin.

223
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:29,948
And now, the bite mark she left

224
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:33,076
throbs every time she's in danger,

225
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,536
as if we're connected somehow.

226
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:37,872
She bit you?

227
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:39,374
Woo-hyeol,

228
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:40,500
did she bite you?

229
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,335
- What?
- I mean,

230
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:44,295
how can a vampire get bitten by a human?

231
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:47,382
Well, she didn't exactly...

232
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:50,135
It wasn't that deep.

233
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:51,136
Where?

234
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:56,766
Here.

235
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:58,852
I don't see anything.

236
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:00,937
That can't be true.

237
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:07,068
Every time she was in danger,
the bite mark would throb, so I saved her.

238
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,779
- Is it really not there?
- Yes.

239
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:10,989
There's nothing.

240
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,492
That's odd.

241
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:17,454
Woo-hyeol,

242
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:20,331
is she the reason you asked
if drinking blood

243
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:22,709
could make you see the past
or former life of someone?

244
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:29,340
What on earth did you see
after tasting a drop of her blood?

245
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:31,593
Well,

246
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:33,553
you see...

247
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:37,515
I have an upset stomach.

248
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:39,142
What did you have for lunch?

249
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,483
What is she doing there?

250
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:47,734
What is it?

251
00:17:53,448 --> 00:17:54,616
Hello?

252
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:57,452
My gosh. You found hair in the tteokbokki?

253
00:17:57,535 --> 00:17:58,912
Goodness me.

254
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:01,372
I'm terribly sorry.
I'll have the order redelivered.

255
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:03,291
How could that have happened? I apologize.

256
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:05,084
My goodness.

257
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,922
I've been so stressed out
that I'm losing my hair.

258
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:12,717
Anyway, I'll go drop off the order
at the high school across the street.

259
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:13,802
Wait.

260
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,095
That one?

261
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:18,473
Yes. They found hair in the food.

262
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:19,974
Dong-seop.

263
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:22,101
Can I

264
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:24,145
deliver the food?

265
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:26,189
- You?
- Yes.

266
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:34,781
GONGCHEON HIGH SCHOOL

267
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:12,610
What the heck?

268
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,196
Am I seeing things now?

269
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:25,164
Please enjoy.

270
00:19:25,248 --> 00:19:28,209
You shouldn't run your business like that.

271
00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:29,836
Not when the food is for kids.

272
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:32,463
Oh, right.

273
00:19:35,425 --> 00:19:37,302
Take this to the dumpster on your way out.

274
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:38,803
We couldn't even eat it.

275
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:41,431
Do me a favor, will you?

276
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:52,150
This is just pure trash...

277
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:03,870
You can't call at the last minute
and say you can't come.

278
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:05,747
We're short-handed as is.

279
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:09,792
When you don't show up,
the workload falls on the rest of us.

280
00:20:11,586 --> 00:20:13,171
Whatever. I'm hanging up.

281
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:16,591
Look here, young man.

282
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:23,640
- Me?
- Hold on.

283
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:27,101
You can't just chuck this out here.

284
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:28,394
Haven't you heard of recycling?

285
00:20:29,187 --> 00:20:30,605
No, I haven't.

286
00:20:31,189 --> 00:20:32,190
What should be recycled?

287
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:34,525
Cans and plastic should be placed

288
00:20:34,609 --> 00:20:36,194
in their designated bins.

289
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:38,321
You can't just leave a heap of trash here.

290
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,573
Look what's in here.

291
00:20:42,784 --> 00:20:45,995
I only brought it here
because someone asked me to.

292
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:49,123
Trash shouldn't be thrown out like this.

293
00:20:49,207 --> 00:20:51,417
Anything stained with chili powder
can't be recycled,

294
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:53,336
but you people never listen.

295
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,421
- Get over here.
- Okay.

296
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:57,632
- Sit.
- Okay.

297
00:20:58,383 --> 00:21:00,677
I'll teach you how to recycle today,

298
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,845
- so put these gloves on.
- Okay.

299
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:05,431
- Watch closely.
- Okay.

300
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:06,599
This is regular trash.

301
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:10,019
As for cans...

302
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:11,104
- Right.
- Cans go in here.

303
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:12,730
Sort out the trash like so.

304
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:14,399
- Okay.
- Good.

305
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:15,650
Here.

306
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:19,153
Anyway,

307
00:21:19,237 --> 00:21:20,530
I don't think I recognize you.

308
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:22,657
Where do you belong?

309
00:21:26,244 --> 00:21:27,203
I'm on my own.

310
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,872
Gosh, don't joke around.
Who sent you here?

311
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:31,124
Dong-seop Snack Shop.

312
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,042
Just get back to work.

313
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:34,919
Okay.

314
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:38,256
By the way,

315
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:41,342
do you know someone
by the name of Joo In-hae?

316
00:21:41,426 --> 00:21:42,301
Joo In-hae?

317
00:21:43,094 --> 00:21:44,762
As in Ms. Joo, the school nurse?

318
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:57,817
Ms. Joo.

319
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:00,611
I tripped and hurt myself.

320
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:26,471
A school nurse
who tends to injured and sick students.

321
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:30,433
What an honorable occupation.

322
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:37,732
Can I help you, sir?

323
00:22:43,154 --> 00:22:44,864
- Go!
- Stop pushing me!

324
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:47,033
The school grounds aren't open
to just anyone!

325
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:49,077
- Hurry up and leave.
- "Just anyone"?

326
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:50,828
Look here.

327
00:22:50,912 --> 00:22:52,497
I was here to make a delivery...

328
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:55,625
If you want me to treat you like a human,

329
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,502
get out there and earn money.

330
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:01,214
Could there

331
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:03,966
perhaps be a job around here I could do?

332
00:23:05,218 --> 00:23:06,552
A job?

333
00:23:06,636 --> 00:23:07,804
What kind of job?

334
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:11,682
I used to teach at a night school.

335
00:23:11,766 --> 00:23:13,935
If I'm to teach students again,

336
00:23:14,352 --> 00:23:16,729
history seems like
the most suitable subject.

337
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:18,272
As a living witness of history,

338
00:23:18,356 --> 00:23:21,400
I can offer great insight to students.

339
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:24,612
What are you yapping on about?

340
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:28,449
There's nothing you can do at this school,

341
00:23:28,533 --> 00:23:30,201
so get lost.

342
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:32,954
- Get lost!
- It can be anything.

343
00:23:33,037 --> 00:23:35,039
- I told you to leave!
- I just need a job.

344
00:23:35,123 --> 00:23:37,333
- Go!
- All I want is a job.

345
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,794
Wait, it's the young man from earlier.

346
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:41,337
- Do you know him?
- Yes.

347
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:43,840
Are you looking for a job?

348
00:23:45,258 --> 00:23:46,467
Yes.

349
00:23:46,551 --> 00:23:48,719
Then follow me if you want.

350
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:11,742
I wasn't expecting a handsome
young man like you as a colleague.

351
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:16,747
My goodness.

352
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:19,834
Right. How may I help you, ladies?

353
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:21,544
Why does he sound so formal?

354
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:28,050
Would you like me to carry this?

355
00:24:31,512 --> 00:24:33,347
My goodness.

356
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,563
He's so handsome!

357
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:42,064
He's unbelievable!

358
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:44,400
- Seriously!
- No way.

359
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:47,403
- He's so hot!
- Can you believe this?

360
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,071
He's so good-looking!

361
00:24:50,907 --> 00:24:52,992
I've never seen someone so handsome.

362
00:25:13,596 --> 00:25:14,430
You.

363
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:20,853
Are you okay, ma'am?

364
00:25:22,063 --> 00:25:23,564
You're a sir, not a ma'am.

365
00:25:24,941 --> 00:25:26,651
You're the motorcycle guy.

366
00:25:27,235 --> 00:25:28,069
Dairyman?

367
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,990
Is this intentional?

368
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,493
Jumping from one women's job to another?

369
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:38,287
And do you keep attacking me on purpose?

370
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:41,540
Pick them all up this second!

371
00:25:41,624 --> 00:25:43,542
Isn't it your job to clean?

372
00:25:48,339 --> 00:25:49,340
That little...

373
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:56,639
TAROT, FORTUNE-TELLING

374
00:26:00,518 --> 00:26:01,811
It's another slow day.

375
00:26:06,274 --> 00:26:08,025
I haven't had a single customer for days.

376
00:26:15,825 --> 00:26:17,618
Are you here for a tarot reading?

377
00:26:26,961 --> 00:26:29,297
I am here to take a load off my heart.

378
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:32,425
Says the man who looks like a guru.

379
00:26:32,633 --> 00:26:34,927
What could be troubling you so much

380
00:26:35,011 --> 00:26:37,179
that brought you to such a humble place?

381
00:26:40,391 --> 00:26:43,644
I have a friend who has been living
his life fueled by one goal,

382
00:26:43,728 --> 00:26:45,271
and there's something I must tell him.

383
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:48,149
But I'm not sure how I should tell him

384
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:50,860
so that he can take it well.

385
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:52,778
I just can't figure it out.

386
00:26:52,862 --> 00:26:54,530
Right, I see.

387
00:26:54,989 --> 00:26:56,866
Anyway, you came to the right place.

388
00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:59,243
Let's take that load off your heart.

389
00:27:09,337 --> 00:27:10,629
You sure know what you're doing.

390
00:27:11,881 --> 00:27:17,219
Now, choose five cards
while thinking about your concern.

391
00:27:20,056 --> 00:27:21,390
Flip one of them.

392
00:27:23,726 --> 00:27:24,602
This is...

393
00:27:28,064 --> 00:27:29,106
Look at the card.

394
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:32,735
It shows a collapsing tower,
which symbolizes efforts in vain.

395
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:35,112
Do you see how the tower
is being struck by lightning?

396
00:27:35,696 --> 00:27:37,656
Talk about a bolt out of the blue.

397
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:42,370
Perhaps your friend has been
working on something for a long time,

398
00:27:42,453 --> 00:27:45,081
but that will all have been for nothing.

399
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:49,168
Or maybe not.

400
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:51,462
I guess the situation is somewhat similar.

401
00:27:51,545 --> 00:27:52,380
Right?

402
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,716
See? The cards always know.

403
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:02,681
What the...

404
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:04,767
Come on.

405
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:06,227
Stop that.

406
00:28:10,231 --> 00:28:12,233
Is it just me
or do these all look the same?

407
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:13,943
If you take a closer look,

408
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:15,694
the colors are slightly...

409
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,865
All is well as long as
the reading is correct.

410
00:28:19,949 --> 00:28:20,825
Trust me on that.

411
00:28:20,908 --> 00:28:22,410
This is the only one you can read, right?

412
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:24,036
Yes.

413
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,914
You're a lost cause.

414
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:29,166
What did you say?

415
00:28:31,127 --> 00:28:32,837
Talk about being rude.

416
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,672
Do you not feel bad

417
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:37,675
for cheating desperate people
out of their money?

418
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:41,387
Shouldn't you know better
after living for hundreds of years?

419
00:28:46,517 --> 00:28:47,351
Who the hell are you?

420
00:28:47,435 --> 00:28:49,103
Guess who I am, and I'll let it slide.

421
00:28:50,187 --> 00:28:51,188
This must be a crackdown.

422
00:28:54,275 --> 00:28:56,068
You pathetic fool.

423
00:28:56,652 --> 00:28:58,696
How do you expect
to put blood on the table?

424
00:29:00,698 --> 00:29:01,740
"Blood"?

425
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,456
I panicked, thinking you're human.

426
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:10,166
Cut a fellow vampire some slack.

427
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:11,500
As if.

428
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:13,169
You and I are different breeds.

429
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:14,670
Right, of course we are.

430
00:29:15,588 --> 00:29:17,882
Anyway, here you go.

431
00:29:17,965 --> 00:29:20,801
The prices are marked, so take your pick.

432
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:24,096
And don't forget to pay me
for the tarot reading.

433
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,264
It's 20 000 won.

434
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:35,774
Come in.

435
00:29:40,446 --> 00:29:42,156
I'm here to empty your trash can.

436
00:29:43,657 --> 00:29:45,117
What are you doing here?

437
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:47,077
Isn't it obvious?

438
00:29:47,161 --> 00:29:48,370
I'm emptying your trash can.

439
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:50,331
REGULAR TRASH

440
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:51,248
I got a job.

441
00:29:51,332 --> 00:29:52,875
Are you crazy?

442
00:29:53,334 --> 00:29:55,169
This is a school and my workplace.

443
00:29:56,003 --> 00:29:57,296
As of today,

444
00:29:57,379 --> 00:29:58,547
it's also mine.

445
00:29:58,631 --> 00:30:01,342
That's not what I meant.

446
00:30:02,218 --> 00:30:03,052
Quit immediately.

447
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:04,136
No.

448
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:06,138
You told me to earn money
if I wanted to be treated as a human.

449
00:30:06,639 --> 00:30:10,559
Also, cleaning turns out to be quite fun.

450
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:13,270
Wait.

451
00:30:13,854 --> 00:30:16,774
Why did you have to choose this school
of all places?

452
00:30:16,857 --> 00:30:19,068
Can't vampires come to school?

453
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:20,986
Of course not! It's filled with students.

454
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:22,863
I'm no threat to them.

455
00:30:22,947 --> 00:30:24,448
How can you guarantee that

456
00:30:24,532 --> 00:30:27,868
when you jumped on me
as soon as you saw me bleeding?

457
00:30:27,952 --> 00:30:29,745
Who knows what'll happen?

458
00:30:30,538 --> 00:30:31,539
Well, that--

459
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:33,207
Ms. Joo, my nose is bleeding.

460
00:30:35,918 --> 00:30:36,961
Please leave.

461
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,129
Right now!

462
00:30:53,561 --> 00:30:55,145
What does she take me for?

463
00:30:56,939 --> 00:30:59,191
The least she can do
is compliment me for working hard,

464
00:30:59,692 --> 00:31:01,527
but instead, she treats me
like I'm some monster.

465
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:04,405
Who says you can get me to quit?

466
00:31:04,488 --> 00:31:05,781
I won't quit!

467
00:31:06,991 --> 00:31:08,617
Woo-hyeol, please calm down.

468
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:11,287
I can't believe
I felt Hae-sun in her blood.

469
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,205
I must've been out of my mind.

470
00:31:13,289 --> 00:31:14,123
What?

471
00:31:14,999 --> 00:31:16,125
It's nothing.

472
00:31:17,585 --> 00:31:21,005
By the way, what are you wearing?
Did you get a job?

473
00:31:22,131 --> 00:31:23,882
Oh, this?

474
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,927
I got a job at the school.

475
00:31:27,011 --> 00:31:29,555
- I see. Congratulations.
- Thanks.

476
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:32,725
But please tell me
you made the delivery first.

477
00:31:35,269 --> 00:31:37,104
Right, of course.

478
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:38,230
I did.

479
00:31:39,273 --> 00:31:40,274
What a relief.

480
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:42,318
Thanks a lot.

481
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:44,111
- It's not much,
- Yes?

482
00:31:44,194 --> 00:31:46,155
but let me at least pay you
for delivering the food.

483
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:48,741
Gosh, forget it. That's not necessary.

484
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:50,034
Keep it.

485
00:31:50,117 --> 00:31:52,786
I got my job thanks to you, so we're good.

486
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:55,247
- But still.
- Don't.

487
00:31:56,457 --> 00:31:59,376
Break time is over. I should get back.

488
00:31:59,627 --> 00:32:01,670
Have a good day. I'm off.

489
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:04,173
But Woo-hyeol...

490
00:32:05,215 --> 00:32:06,342
I should've offered more.

491
00:32:12,014 --> 00:32:13,932
WINE BAR CONSTRUCTION COMPLETION REPORT

492
00:32:21,899 --> 00:32:24,902
In-hae, are you free this evening?

493
00:32:26,028 --> 00:32:28,530
If you are, maybe we can grab dinner.

494
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:45,172
Sounds good.

495
00:32:45,255 --> 00:32:46,632
Where should we meet?

496
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:57,434
Do-sik, I'm at the address you texted me.

497
00:32:58,018 --> 00:32:59,436
Are you sure this is the place?

498
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,397
Where are you? I'm on my way out.

499
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:03,774
- Do-sik.
- Hey, In-hae.

500
00:33:03,857 --> 00:33:05,943
- Gosh, that took me a while.
- This is the place.

501
00:33:06,694 --> 00:33:08,153
I was looking around everywhere.

502
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:09,863
Let's head in.

503
00:33:10,364 --> 00:33:13,867
SMALL TALK WINE BAR

504
00:33:13,951 --> 00:33:14,952
Here.

505
00:33:31,552 --> 00:33:32,678
Have a seat.

506
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:36,390
I didn't expect this
from what I saw outside.

507
00:33:38,392 --> 00:33:39,435
Thank you.

508
00:33:42,688 --> 00:33:44,481
Is it because it's remote?

509
00:33:44,565 --> 00:33:45,524
It's almost empty.

510
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:48,694
- It isn't officially open yet.
- Sorry?

511
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:50,904
It's the wine bar my company is opening.

512
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:52,781
The official opening is next week,

513
00:33:52,865 --> 00:33:54,491
but I wanted to bring you here
before that.

514
00:33:58,412 --> 00:34:01,248
It's been a while since we met,
and we haven't even had a meal together.

515
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,626
I probably lost
a lot of points as a friend,

516
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,211
but here's to making up for it.

517
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:11,258
Choose a dish,
and I'll recommend the wine.

518
00:34:13,135 --> 00:34:14,595
MAIN DISH

519
00:34:23,312 --> 00:34:26,565
I'm not familiar with these things,
so you can just order.

520
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,067
Is that so?

521
00:34:30,486 --> 00:34:31,612
Then first,

522
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:35,240
we'll have a cheese platter
and a bottle of Côtes-du Village.

523
00:34:35,324 --> 00:34:36,867
It's quite delicious.

524
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:37,910
Would you like to try it?

525
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,079
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

526
00:34:42,164 --> 00:34:43,707
Damn recycling.

527
00:34:44,917 --> 00:34:46,627
Goodness.

528
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:50,005
DAEBAK BUTCHER SHOP

529
00:34:50,964 --> 00:34:51,840
What's...

530
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:53,592
this smell?

531
00:34:55,469 --> 00:34:58,722
I'll get right to you
once I'm done with this.

532
00:35:19,827 --> 00:35:20,953
Teeth.

533
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:23,497
His teeth.

534
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:25,999
They're pointy.

535
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:32,840
Min-jae.

536
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:37,344
What did I say about
pointing fingers at people?

537
00:35:37,553 --> 00:35:39,888
- I hate you, Dad.
- I apologize.

538
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:41,807
It is all right.

539
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:47,354
How much is this?

540
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:49,523
Let's see.

541
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:51,108
Do you need ox blood?

542
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:52,776
Are you making soup?

543
00:35:54,194 --> 00:35:55,320
Hold on.

544
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:58,031
Didn't we meet
in front of the mansion the other day?

545
00:35:58,115 --> 00:35:59,992
You said you were the owner.

546
00:36:08,542 --> 00:36:10,627
- You do look familiar.
- I knew it.

547
00:36:11,128 --> 00:36:13,922
Did you get into the house all right?

548
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:18,510
Luckily, I managed to find the key.

549
00:36:20,596 --> 00:36:23,181
Aren't you the one who told me

550
00:36:24,057 --> 00:36:26,226
that my family will be blessed
for generations?

551
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:28,812
- Right?
- That crazy--

552
00:36:28,896 --> 00:36:31,189
You're the one
who resembles your ancestor.

553
00:36:31,273 --> 00:36:32,482
Right.

554
00:36:33,483 --> 00:36:35,110
Anyway, do you want some?

555
00:36:36,236 --> 00:36:37,321
Well...

556
00:36:39,323 --> 00:36:42,409
I'm afraid I forgot to bring any money.

557
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:44,202
Do you live around here?

558
00:36:44,286 --> 00:36:46,204
He does, in the huge mansion nearby.

559
00:36:46,288 --> 00:36:47,873
The one with the walls.

560
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,207
He lives in that mansion?

561
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:50,959
Yes.

562
00:36:51,043 --> 00:36:52,586
The haunted house?

563
00:36:53,045 --> 00:36:56,089
The place is off-limits to kids
because it's spooky as hell.

564
00:36:56,173 --> 00:36:57,424
Do you really live there?

565
00:36:57,925 --> 00:36:59,134
We thought it was empty.

566
00:37:02,095 --> 00:37:04,640
The house had been vacant for a long time,

567
00:37:05,641 --> 00:37:07,684
and I only just returned.

568
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:09,227
You returned?

569
00:37:11,355 --> 00:37:14,399
Would you perhaps
like to stay for a cup of coffee?

570
00:37:14,483 --> 00:37:15,651
No.

571
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:17,235
That is quite all right.

572
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:18,320
And the ox blood?

573
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:21,657
I shall return.

574
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:30,040
- He returned here?
- After a long time?

575
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:32,501
Daebak Real Estate,
Jeil Real Estate, or Woori Real Estate.

576
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:34,086
The house wasn't sold by any of them.

577
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:36,213
So when did he buy the place?

578
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:42,219
Why are they all so nosy?

579
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:57,901
Mr. Ko.

580
00:37:58,568 --> 00:37:59,403
Have you been well?

581
00:38:08,578 --> 00:38:10,038
You drank a drop of her blood?

582
00:38:11,832 --> 00:38:14,167
Yes, one thing led to another and...

583
00:38:14,251 --> 00:38:16,628
I told you to keep an eye on her,
not drink her blood.

584
00:38:20,757 --> 00:38:23,885
But I felt something strange

585
00:38:24,386 --> 00:38:25,721
from Butler Joo's blood.

586
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:27,639
What do you mean?

587
00:38:27,931 --> 00:38:30,642
I felt Hae-sun in her blood.

588
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:37,232
She's the one who sacrificed herself
for me a very long time ago.

589
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:49,161
Woo-hyeol.

590
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:56,168
Woo-hyeol.

591
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:08,013
Hae-sun.

592
00:39:19,483 --> 00:39:20,567
What's wrong?

593
00:39:22,319 --> 00:39:23,653
You must run away.

594
00:39:24,321 --> 00:39:25,781
The people found out.

595
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:28,241
They will come for you.

596
00:39:32,913 --> 00:39:34,206
It is all my fault.

597
00:39:35,415 --> 00:39:36,625
Because of me...

598
00:39:51,932 --> 00:39:54,101
Let's go together.

599
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:55,977
Let's run away together.

600
00:39:56,353 --> 00:39:58,647
That's the only way we can be together.

601
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:12,119
What is the meaning of this, Lord Shin?

602
00:40:12,202 --> 00:40:13,286
Step aside.

603
00:40:14,204 --> 00:40:15,580
He is a vampire.

604
00:40:15,789 --> 00:40:18,041
He is a dangerous being
who feeds on human blood.

605
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:19,042
No, he is not.

606
00:40:19,126 --> 00:40:21,628
He is the one who saved my life.

607
00:40:21,962 --> 00:40:24,714
He would never knowingly hurt a human.

608
00:40:25,715 --> 00:40:28,093
How is a lady of noble birth

609
00:40:28,385 --> 00:40:30,345
defending such a monster?

610
00:40:31,304 --> 00:40:33,265
Step aside while I give you the chance.

611
00:40:40,063 --> 00:40:41,231
If you do not,

612
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:44,359
we will have no other choice.

613
00:40:51,867 --> 00:40:53,952
She stood up for me in front of others.

614
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:58,582
She's the only person
who accepted me for who I am.

615
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:01,126
Even while sacrificing her life for me,

616
00:41:02,586 --> 00:41:04,671
she allowed me to drink her blood.

617
00:41:08,341 --> 00:41:09,759
It makes no sense.

618
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:12,762
From their looks to their conduct,

619
00:41:12,846 --> 00:41:15,140
they couldn't be more different.

620
00:41:17,893 --> 00:41:21,271
So how could I have felt Hae-sun
in Butler Joo's blood?

621
00:41:22,189 --> 00:41:25,567
When you miss someone deeply,
it can cause confusion.

622
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:28,195
On top of that, you hadn't had
fresh human blood in ages.

623
00:41:29,613 --> 00:41:30,989
Give me your hand.

624
00:41:33,575 --> 00:41:34,784
Sure.

625
00:41:45,754 --> 00:41:46,796
How peculiar.

626
00:41:47,547 --> 00:41:48,673
Is there something--

627
00:41:48,757 --> 00:41:51,051
Do not covet her blood again.

628
00:41:52,344 --> 00:41:54,387
Her blood is poison to you.

629
00:41:56,806 --> 00:41:57,849
"Poison"?

630
00:42:09,569 --> 00:42:11,363
Take water for instance.

631
00:42:12,072 --> 00:42:14,616
Water starts boiling at 100°C.

632
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:17,410
So what would happen
if it is removed from the heat at 99°C?

633
00:42:18,745 --> 00:42:20,997
It wouldn't boil.

634
00:42:21,081 --> 00:42:22,082
That's right.

635
00:42:22,165 --> 00:42:24,751
I don't know how she opened your coffin,

636
00:42:25,168 --> 00:42:27,128
but what she did was the equivalent

637
00:42:27,212 --> 00:42:29,673
of removing the water from the heat
just before it boiled.

638
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,344
To make the water boil,

639
00:42:34,427 --> 00:42:35,637
you need her blood.

640
00:42:37,597 --> 00:42:38,932
Her blood?

641
00:42:39,015 --> 00:42:40,475
You just said it was poison.

642
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:43,812
That's right. Her blood
is too cold for you right now.

643
00:42:44,396 --> 00:42:46,481
Rather than heating the water
to its boiling point,

644
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,608
it will cool it down.

645
00:42:54,531 --> 00:42:57,033
Have you ever seen a human in love?

646
00:42:57,909 --> 00:42:59,035
Of course.

647
00:43:03,248 --> 00:43:05,750
Rosy cheeks, flushed lips,

648
00:43:06,418 --> 00:43:09,337
and blood pumping wildly through the body
from the heart.

649
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:11,256
It's a marvelous sight.

650
00:43:12,132 --> 00:43:12,966
That's it.

651
00:43:13,049 --> 00:43:14,801
Her poisonous cold blood

652
00:43:15,468 --> 00:43:17,470
must be filled with passionate love.

653
00:43:19,556 --> 00:43:21,599
You must get her to fall in love.

654
00:43:22,475 --> 00:43:24,436
That is what you must do.

655
00:43:26,354 --> 00:43:27,647
Drink her blood

656
00:43:28,773 --> 00:43:30,191
after she falls in love,

657
00:43:31,484 --> 00:43:32,485
and you will

658
00:43:32,944 --> 00:43:34,487
become human.

659
00:43:43,163 --> 00:43:44,998
"Blood filled with passionate love"?

660
00:43:55,592 --> 00:43:56,676
How's your new place?

661
00:43:57,469 --> 00:43:58,511
Do you like it?

662
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:00,388
Well, kind of.

663
00:44:01,097 --> 00:44:02,223
It's not so bad.

664
00:44:02,474 --> 00:44:04,934
It must require maintenance
considering how old it is.

665
00:44:06,269 --> 00:44:08,271
I'll have to fix the issues as I go.

666
00:44:08,772 --> 00:44:10,315
Let me know if you need any help.

667
00:44:12,525 --> 00:44:13,777
Okay.

668
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:18,823
Thank you for the meal today.

669
00:44:18,907 --> 00:44:20,158
Get home safely.

670
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:21,409
Just a second.

671
00:44:25,789 --> 00:44:26,706
What's this?

672
00:44:27,624 --> 00:44:28,917
It's a housewarming gift.

673
00:44:29,876 --> 00:44:31,169
This really isn't necessary.

674
00:44:31,252 --> 00:44:32,796
It's nothing big. Open it.

675
00:44:44,516 --> 00:44:47,018
I noticed the other day that the alley
was rather dark and secluded.

676
00:44:47,102 --> 00:44:48,895
It must be scary to walk home alone.

677
00:44:51,106 --> 00:44:52,232
Thanks, Do-sik.

678
00:44:52,315 --> 00:44:54,401
Hopefully, you'll never get to use them,

679
00:44:54,776 --> 00:44:56,111
but just in case.

680
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:09,666
I'll get going then.

681
00:45:40,029 --> 00:45:42,323
Goodness, you reek of alcohol.

682
00:45:42,824 --> 00:45:43,908
You can smell it from there?

683
00:45:45,368 --> 00:45:46,953
We, vampires,

684
00:45:47,454 --> 00:45:49,581
have heightened senses compared to humans.

685
00:45:50,123 --> 00:45:52,834
We're sensitive to smell,
so please keep that in mind.

686
00:45:53,418 --> 00:45:54,711
Whatever you say.

687
00:45:55,044 --> 00:45:58,089
Also, it's not respectable

688
00:45:58,339 --> 00:46:00,341
to chat so loudly on the street.

689
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:02,510
Why would you eavesdrop?

690
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:04,512
I didn't.

691
00:46:04,596 --> 00:46:07,682
I just happened to hear it
while I was on the roof of my own house.

692
00:46:08,433 --> 00:46:10,435
As I said, I have heightened senses.

693
00:46:11,102 --> 00:46:12,437
That includes my hearing.

694
00:46:17,817 --> 00:46:19,068
By the way,

695
00:46:19,152 --> 00:46:21,112
quit your job at school.

696
00:46:22,363 --> 00:46:23,573
No.

697
00:46:24,157 --> 00:46:26,618
Or I'll expose your true identity.

698
00:46:26,951 --> 00:46:28,411
Do as you please.

699
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:39,839
I thought you wanted me to earn my keep.

700
00:46:39,923 --> 00:46:42,717
GONGCHEON HIGH SCHOOL

701
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,677
There's so much trash to sort out.

702
00:46:45,261 --> 00:46:47,597
CAFETERIA

703
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,642
I will take care of it, so do not worry.

704
00:46:50,725 --> 00:46:52,352
I hate to burden you like this.

705
00:46:55,438 --> 00:46:56,981
The boss shouldn't see you resting.

706
00:46:58,274 --> 00:46:59,108
Right.

707
00:46:59,776 --> 00:47:01,152
You should go to the nurse's office.

708
00:47:01,903 --> 00:47:03,112
Go rest there.

709
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:04,739
You have a bad leg as well.

710
00:47:05,031 --> 00:47:06,783
Thank you, young man.

711
00:47:23,049 --> 00:47:24,133
Come in.

712
00:47:37,021 --> 00:47:39,649
Your ankle is swollen and badly bruised.

713
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:41,442
Doesn't it hurt?

714
00:47:41,526 --> 00:47:45,655
I sprained my ankle while walking down
the stairs this morning.

715
00:47:48,366 --> 00:47:49,701
This might be a bit cold.

716
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:56,708
I recommend that you rest for a while.

717
00:47:56,791 --> 00:47:59,002
If you walk on this, it'll only get worse.

718
00:47:59,085 --> 00:47:59,919
Okay.

719
00:48:01,462 --> 00:48:02,714
Thank you, Ms. Joo.

720
00:48:03,923 --> 00:48:07,594
The young man
who recently joined the cleaning crew

721
00:48:07,802 --> 00:48:09,846
has been so considerate.

722
00:48:10,138 --> 00:48:12,640
I only came to see you
because he insisted.

723
00:48:13,558 --> 00:48:16,185
He even offered to fill in for me.

724
00:48:17,937 --> 00:48:19,230
He's not like people of this day and age.

725
00:48:19,314 --> 00:48:21,566
Well, he's not someone
from this day and age.

726
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,860
- What?
- Sorry?

727
00:48:24,652 --> 00:48:26,404
Oh, it's nothing.

728
00:48:26,487 --> 00:48:29,240
He doesn't mind carrying heavy things

729
00:48:29,324 --> 00:48:31,034
and respects his elders.

730
00:48:31,117 --> 00:48:32,577
He's been a huge help.

731
00:48:50,219 --> 00:48:52,597
Why is it that there's no end
to this so-called recycling?

732
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:53,681
Why?!

733
00:48:54,766 --> 00:48:55,600
Seriously.

734
00:49:15,453 --> 00:49:16,412
That little brat.

735
00:49:20,333 --> 00:49:22,126
Classes resumed ages ago.

736
00:49:23,336 --> 00:49:24,962
Where were they at?

737
00:49:33,638 --> 00:49:35,682
What were they up to back here?

738
00:49:39,143 --> 00:49:40,687
More recyclables, I see.

739
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:43,314
Goodness.

740
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:48,069
Woo-hyeol, where are you?

741
00:49:48,152 --> 00:49:49,112
I'll be right there!

742
00:50:03,835 --> 00:50:05,211
Is there a fire?

743
00:50:06,963 --> 00:50:08,214
What's with the fire trucks?

744
00:50:11,718 --> 00:50:13,136
There's a fire.

745
00:50:21,602 --> 00:50:23,730
- My gosh.
- How did this happen?

746
00:50:23,813 --> 00:50:24,897
Goodness.

747
00:50:24,981 --> 00:50:28,276
Make sure it doesn't spread
to the adjacent building!

748
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:30,361
- Oh, dear.
- My gosh.

749
00:50:30,862 --> 00:50:32,321
Who started it?

750
00:50:34,866 --> 00:50:36,117
Hurry.

751
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,411
- Oh, my.
- My goodness.

752
00:50:38,494 --> 00:50:41,205
- What's going on?
- The storage caught on fire.

753
00:50:41,289 --> 00:50:42,582
- Fire?
- That's right.

754
00:50:42,665 --> 00:50:44,834
What will we do? My goodness!

755
00:50:44,917 --> 00:50:46,419
- Oh, no!
- How...

756
00:50:46,502 --> 00:50:47,754
My goodness.

757
00:50:47,837 --> 00:50:49,380
What are we going to do?

758
00:50:49,464 --> 00:50:51,257
Oh, dear!

759
00:50:53,426 --> 00:50:55,803
I knew there would be a fire.

760
00:50:55,887 --> 00:50:57,722
- Gosh.
- I see there's a fire.

761
00:51:02,310 --> 00:51:03,770
- It wasn't me.
- What do we do?

762
00:51:03,853 --> 00:51:05,396
I told you not to smoke.

763
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:07,565
- Please step back.
- Oh, dear.

764
00:51:07,648 --> 00:51:08,691
I know what to do.

765
00:51:17,033 --> 00:51:20,203
A member of the cleaning crew
smoked behind the abandoned storage?

766
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:25,333
How thoughtless can you be?

767
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:27,960
Your job is to clean,
not smoke on school grounds!

768
00:51:28,836 --> 00:51:31,547
The entire school almost went up in flames
because of you!

769
00:51:33,382 --> 00:51:35,301
I never smoked.

770
00:51:35,384 --> 00:51:36,636
All I did was clean up the area.

771
00:51:37,386 --> 00:51:39,096
How dare you deny it?

772
00:51:39,347 --> 00:51:40,890
The kids saw you!

773
00:51:41,516 --> 00:51:44,727
They saw you smoke there,
so don't you dare deny it!

774
00:51:47,063 --> 00:51:48,648
Sir,

775
00:51:48,731 --> 00:51:50,691
there seems to be a misunderstanding.

776
00:51:50,983 --> 00:51:52,735
I've gotten to know him,

777
00:51:52,819 --> 00:51:55,822
and he's not one to blatantly lie.

778
00:51:55,905 --> 00:51:57,490
When he saw I hurt my leg,

779
00:51:57,573 --> 00:51:59,867
he sent me to the nurse
and filled in for me.

780
00:51:59,951 --> 00:52:02,370
You rested at the nurse's office
while on the job?

781
00:52:03,371 --> 00:52:06,749
How could you be resting
while on the clock?

782
00:52:07,708 --> 00:52:10,127
Just quit if you're going to slack off!

783
00:52:11,087 --> 00:52:14,382
Maybe it's about time
we switched cleaning companies.

784
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:18,344
Hey.

785
00:52:19,095 --> 00:52:20,471
How will you take responsibility for this?

786
00:52:20,555 --> 00:52:21,889
I won't let it slide.

787
00:52:21,973 --> 00:52:26,185
The school will officially
file for damages

788
00:52:26,269 --> 00:52:29,522
and have you compensate us, understood?!

789
00:52:31,274 --> 00:52:34,026
Instead of cleaning,
he was smoking on school grounds.

790
00:52:34,777 --> 00:52:36,237
What will the students learn?

791
00:52:36,654 --> 00:52:38,364
Who hired someone like that?

792
00:52:45,955 --> 00:52:47,623
- Sir.
- What's your problem?

793
00:52:47,707 --> 00:52:48,708
What is it?

794
00:52:54,213 --> 00:52:55,965
You have the wrong person.

795
00:52:58,968 --> 00:52:59,886
Smell his hand.

796
00:53:12,523 --> 00:53:14,358
- Why you...
- Didn't you know

797
00:53:14,442 --> 00:53:17,486
kids gather behind the abandoned storage
to smoke and drink?

798
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:20,281
Or did you knowingly turn a blind eye?

799
00:53:24,493 --> 00:53:26,245
In case you didn't know,
here's the evidence.

800
00:53:47,683 --> 00:53:48,684
You little...

801
00:53:50,353 --> 00:53:53,481
Let's not accuse the wrong person
when it's clear who's at fault.

802
00:53:53,564 --> 00:53:56,567
- Can you believe it?
- No way.

803
00:53:59,695 --> 00:54:03,074
Why would you hide there and smoke
when you should be studying?

804
00:54:03,532 --> 00:54:04,784
Have your parents come see me!

805
00:54:08,955 --> 00:54:10,957
Don't just stand there. You're dismissed!

806
00:54:16,379 --> 00:54:18,130
Get over here.

807
00:54:26,806 --> 00:54:30,226
Something's fishy.

808
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:31,978
What?

809
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:33,562
What do you mean?

810
00:54:33,646 --> 00:54:35,773
The guy who moved into the mansion.

811
00:54:35,856 --> 00:54:37,900
He gets on my nerves.

812
00:54:38,609 --> 00:54:40,569
He speaks a bit strangely,

813
00:54:40,653 --> 00:54:42,279
but he's tall and good-looking.

814
00:54:42,363 --> 00:54:45,157
Who cares about his looks?

815
00:54:45,241 --> 00:54:47,243
Did you already forget?

816
00:54:47,326 --> 00:54:49,537
The neighborhood was almost chosen
for redevelopment.

817
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:51,122
Yes, I remember that.

818
00:54:51,205 --> 00:54:53,457
There were talks,
but then it never happened.

819
00:54:53,541 --> 00:54:54,875
That's right.

820
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:57,878
And it's because of that mansion.

821
00:54:58,462 --> 00:55:00,756
The owner of the mansion back then

822
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:03,592
made a huge fuss
and refused to sell the place,

823
00:55:04,010 --> 00:55:05,136
so the project was squashed.

824
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:07,013
Is that so?

825
00:55:08,556 --> 00:55:12,059
The owner was adamant about
not selling the place.

826
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:15,438
So who's that man
and how is he living there?

827
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:19,442
I'm sure the owner had their reasons.

828
00:55:19,525 --> 00:55:21,902
You dimwit.

829
00:55:21,986 --> 00:55:24,989
This isn't a matter to take lightly.

830
00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:28,868
The mansion has to be taken down
for the area to be redeveloped.

831
00:55:28,951 --> 00:55:32,913
It's standing firm
and ruining our neighborhood image.

832
00:55:34,665 --> 00:55:37,251
That's why real estate prices
have been at a standstill.

833
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:38,461
So what?

834
00:55:38,794 --> 00:55:42,006
It's not like we can kick him
out of the house.

835
00:55:42,715 --> 00:55:43,674
First,

836
00:55:44,717 --> 00:55:48,429
we'll have to find out
why he moved in there.

837
00:55:49,055 --> 00:55:50,890
If things don't look good,

838
00:55:52,058 --> 00:55:54,935
we'll make him leave of his own accord.

839
00:56:09,617 --> 00:56:12,953
Let's not accuse the wrong person
when it's clear who's at fault.

840
00:56:13,162 --> 00:56:15,456
He is the one who saved my life.

841
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:18,626
He would never knowingly hurt a human.

842
00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:25,299
What on earth did you see
after tasting a drop of her blood?

843
00:56:27,134 --> 00:56:28,552
I definitely felt Hae-sun

844
00:56:29,678 --> 00:56:31,222
in her blood.

845
00:56:31,764 --> 00:56:32,807
I see myself...

846
00:56:33,808 --> 00:56:34,642
in your eyes.

847
00:56:34,975 --> 00:56:37,812
Are you not afraid of me?

848
00:56:38,646 --> 00:56:40,481
I'm not that afraid of you.

849
00:56:41,357 --> 00:56:43,651
You saved me from death.

850
00:56:44,819 --> 00:56:47,947
You're my one and only friend.

851
00:57:17,518 --> 00:57:19,270
Welcome, Ms. Na.

852
00:57:45,337 --> 00:57:46,505
What is it?

853
00:57:50,843 --> 00:57:51,844
What?

854
00:57:52,178 --> 00:57:53,012
What's wrong?

855
00:57:58,017 --> 00:57:58,976
Hae-sun.

856
00:58:15,993 --> 00:58:16,952
Drink my blood...

857
00:58:18,954 --> 00:58:20,372
and remember me.

858
00:58:34,428 --> 00:58:35,554
It's you, right?

859
00:58:37,389 --> 00:58:38,515
Have you been well?

860
00:59:34,613 --> 00:59:37,533
HEARTBEAT

861
00:59:37,616 --> 00:59:40,119
There was a woman
who sacrificed herself to save me.

862
00:59:40,202 --> 00:59:41,578
I keep thinking about it.

863
00:59:41,662 --> 00:59:42,913
As if it belonged to me.

864
00:59:42,997 --> 00:59:43,831
- Me?
- You're Hae-sun, right?

865
00:59:43,914 --> 00:59:45,958
Stop! My current life is exhausting as is,

866
00:59:46,041 --> 00:59:47,418
so stop yapping about my former life.

867
00:59:47,501 --> 00:59:49,336
Could I get her to fall in love?

868
00:59:50,462 --> 00:59:52,756
- Do you think I'll go with you?
- Yes.

869
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:55,050
Is he going on a date?

870
00:59:55,134 --> 00:59:58,095
Have you once thought about
how she ended up

871
00:59:58,178 --> 00:59:59,221
with such poisonous blood?

872
00:59:59,305 --> 01:00:00,389
No.

873
01:00:00,472 --> 01:00:02,725
Butler Joo,
did you get fired because of me?

874
01:00:02,808 --> 01:00:05,561
Are you competing with Mr. Seon
for the rights?

875
01:00:06,061 --> 01:00:07,938
If that's the case,
I might be able to help.

876
01:00:08,022 --> 01:00:10,524
You must touch her heart.

877
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:12,568
Although you were alone,
you stayed strong.

878
01:00:13,193 --> 01:00:14,445
You're doing great.

879
01:00:19,158 --> 01:00:21,160
