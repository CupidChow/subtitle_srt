00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:15,261
Haven't you sucked enough blood?

5
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:18,138
Now leave.

6
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:09,523
Let's...

7
00:03:09,607 --> 00:03:10,441
go home.

8
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:17,281
You crazy bastard!

9
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:24,872
If you come back in here
claiming to be a vampire again,

10
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:27,082
I'll make you pay.

11
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:32,588
If I take your hand,

12
00:03:34,465 --> 00:03:35,966
what will happen to me?

13
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:38,844
Are you here

14
00:03:39,637 --> 00:03:41,221
to save me?

15
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:42,806
Or...

16
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:45,851
catch me?

17
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:51,857
For now,

18
00:03:53,776 --> 00:03:55,319
let's say I'm here to save you.

19
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,457
Hey! Stop right there!

20
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,627
Where do you think you're going?

21
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:14,088
That ungrateful brat.

22
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:25,557
Stop running away!

23
00:04:30,104 --> 00:04:32,022
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

24
00:04:35,818 --> 00:04:38,153
That's not the problem, officers.
He's a crook.

25
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:39,446
He conned me.

26
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:40,948
You have to arrest him now!

27
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:42,408
Please save me.

28
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:44,827
Please take me to a safe place.

29
00:04:45,828 --> 00:04:48,330
Please hurry, officers.

30
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:51,792
Hurry.

EPISODE 3

INTELLIGENT CRIME INVESTIGATION TEAM

33
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,389
- Tell me the truth.
- I'm serious!

34
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,683
I slashed his face with my knife,

35
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:10,310
and the wound disappeared immediately.

36
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:12,146
So you used a knife?

37
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:13,564
And he was extremely strong.

38
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:16,900
He bent a steel pipe like it was rubber.

39
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:18,444
And a steel pipe?

40
00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:20,487
That bastard...

41
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:21,697
He's no human.

42
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,948
I saw everything.

43
00:05:23,032 --> 00:05:23,991
I know what he is.

44
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:26,118
What do you call it?

45
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,830
A vampire.

46
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:31,040
That bastard is a vampire.

47
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:35,002
Are you joking?

48
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:36,837
A vampire?

49
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,132
She saw him too!

50
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:42,509
Tell him what you saw.

51
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:44,887
You were there too!
What I said is true, isn't it?

52
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:48,849
Is it?

53
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:54,521
You better tell him the truth.

54
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:00,277
You damn crook.

55
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,029
Who are you to call him a vampire

56
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:04,364
when you've sucked me dry
by taking my money?

57
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:05,657
Give me back my deposit!

58
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:06,992
Give me back my money!

59
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:09,078
- Did you use it up already?
- No.

60
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:10,496
Give it back to me!

61
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:12,372
- I never took your money.
- There he is.

62
00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:14,458
- Over there!
- There he is!

63
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,562
The more I think about it,
the more upsetting it is.

64
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:38,649
I jumped through the hoops to save her,

65
00:06:39,108 --> 00:06:41,860
and she ditched me
without even thanking me?

66
00:06:43,946 --> 00:06:46,615
What a cold-hearted woman.

67
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:51,745
How did I end up
getting involved with someone like her?

68
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:07,678
And what was that about?

69
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:29,908
What is this place?

70
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:40,919
A waterfall inside a building?

71
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,098
Feel free to take a look around.

72
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:04,151
Wow, that jacket looks perfect on you.

73
00:08:04,443 --> 00:08:06,320
You look like a model.

74
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:09,323
I'm not surprised.

75
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,576
Would you like to try on a few more?

76
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,731
You look great.

77
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:45,901
- Would you like to purchase all of them?
- Sure, please--

78
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:48,070
Wait, I don't have money.

79
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,034
Will you pay it in full
or in installments?

80
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:55,202
I'll pay in full.

81
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:57,913
Right.

82
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:01,625
I forgot I had this.

83
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:03,961
I'll pay with this.

84
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,421
In installments?

85
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:08,298
I'll pay in full.

86
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:14,972
"Enjoy Korean food in style."

87
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,309
Where's the food though?

88
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:35,993
They're Bluetooth earbuds.

89
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:41,957
I'll pay in full.

90
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:50,632
I'll pay in full.

91
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:56,388
There are many victims,

92
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:58,682
and he'd rather serve time
than pay them back.

93
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:02,060
It won't be easy
to get your money back soon.

94
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:14,323
Wait. My wallet.

95
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:22,873
My phone's dead too.

96
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:27,586
This is driving me nuts.

97
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:49,358
This thing is incredible.

98
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:51,443
I can't believe

99
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,528
I can buy so much with just this.

100
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,867
Where should I go next?

101
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:14,216
Why are you getting home so late?

102
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:16,259
Hurry and open the door.

103
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:22,307
Hold on.

104
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:26,228
What are all those?

105
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:27,646
These?

106
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:32,484
Right.

107
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,371
- It's maxed out.
- Hey!

108
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:52,796
You were asleep for 100 years.

109
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:54,589
Do you even know how to use these?

110
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:56,758
I can learn.

111
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:00,637
What on earth is this?

112
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,013
That?

113
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:07,060
These are called Bluetooth earbuds.

114
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:09,771
If I put these in my ears,

115
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,982
I can listen to music.

116
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,568
I'm quite fond of music, you see.

117
00:12:15,444 --> 00:12:18,321
I thought I'd need these

118
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:20,115
when I buy my cell phone.

119
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:22,325
That's not what I was asking!

120
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:24,286
Who said you could use my card?

121
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:27,456
Why?!

122
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,169
You think I don't buy them
because I don't know about them?

123
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:36,381
I've been using these for years,
and one side even stopped working!

124
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:39,634
My gosh!

125
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:53,690
Can you bite me?

126
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:56,276
- What?
- You die if you get bitten

127
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:57,319
by a vampire, right?

128
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,405
Let's get it over with.

129
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:02,365
How dare you say that?

130
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,494
You want me to kill you after I saved you?

131
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,039
I have no reason to live.

132
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:11,708
Not only did I lose my money,

133
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,002
but there's a vampire living
in the house I inherited,

134
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:16,254
and that vampire maxed out my card.

135
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:22,677
I have no choice but to die.

136
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:24,596
Don't you agree?

137
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,182
I'd rather die.

138
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:30,936
Why would you die over just some money?

139
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:35,357
"Just some money"?

140
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:39,027
Say that again, will you?

141
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,571
Do you know how I've been living
because of that damned money?!

142
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,825
I've lived on expired food
from the convenience store to save money.

143
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:49,454
And people call me a tenacious bitch
for living such a life.

144
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,289
TO DISCARD

145
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:11,309
So don't you dare talk
about money like that.

146
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:13,144
Money is everything to me!

147
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,776
Why are you trying so hard to save up?

148
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:25,615
I don't have any family or friends,

149
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:27,158
and I never plan on getting married.

150
00:14:27,242 --> 00:14:29,786
I'll be on my own forever,
so I'm responsible for myself.

151
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:32,789
I despise inconveniencing others
or asking for help.

152
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,752
So the only way to protect myself
is by having money.

153
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:42,424
And you'll regret living like that
in your last moments.

154
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:44,968
I'm speaking from experience.

155
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,178
Even 100 years pass by
in the blink of an eye.

156
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:49,639
It feels like I didn't get
a wink of sleep.

157
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:53,184
So you should live your life
doing what you want.

158
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:56,396
Follow your heart.

159
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:58,231
Don't live for money.

160
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:02,527
Who are you to lecture me
after maxing out my card?

161
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,112
So what if you're a vampire?

162
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:05,947
So what?

163
00:15:07,324 --> 00:15:11,119
If I had known this would happen,
I should've told the cops the truth.

164
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:17,208
I will give you the money.

165
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:20,128
Do you think I went into that coffin

166
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:21,671
without any plans?

167
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:26,217
I made preparations
for circumstances like this.

168
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:31,640
I knew something like this would happen
so I prepared myself.

169
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:32,807
What does she take me for?

170
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:50,116
I almost burned them all away.

171
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:06,966
- Gosh.
- My goodness.

172
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:12,847
What are all these?

173
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:14,474
They belong to Mr. Seon.

174
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:19,729
It's for when I become human.

175
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:23,858
Times may change, but gold won't.

176
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,778
Why do you have so much?

177
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:28,905
If you sleep above this,
you'll get a rash.

178
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,574
Please put it down
before you get a rash on your side.

179
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:38,415
Such great foresight.

180
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,251
All right.

181
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:42,627
With this,

182
00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:44,462
I'll be able to live without any...

183
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:47,882
It's empty.

184
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,428
Where did they all go?

185
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:27,630
Well...

186
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:29,632
The thing is...

187
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,469
I had hidden some gold under the floor

188
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:35,847
for when I woke up.

189
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:39,601
But they all

190
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:41,895
vanished without a trace.

191
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:47,066
What did I expect?

192
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,068
I swear I put them...

193
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:50,320
Forget it.

194
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:51,362
Put this on.

195
00:17:56,785 --> 00:17:57,619
For what?

196
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:00,955
You want me to leave?

197
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,500
We should return and sell what we can

198
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,502
to make up for the money you've spent.

199
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:06,419
"Sell"?

200
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:08,254
You're going to sell this?

201
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:13,843
Do you really think there's anyone
who can pull this coat off like I do?

202
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:30,568
Right.

203
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:49,045
WRITE POST

204
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:53,299
TITLE: COAT FOR SALE

205
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:55,468
PRICE: 800 000 WON

206
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:00,640
THE PRICE IS NON-NEGOTIABLE!

207
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:08,147
The fact that she opened it and awoke you

208
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:09,899
tells me she is no ordinary human.

209
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:12,902
Keep her by your side
and keep an eye on her.

210
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:14,487
She might be the one holding the key.

211
00:19:17,949 --> 00:19:20,076
How on earth did she open it?

212
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:22,245
What did you say?

213
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:24,664
Nothing.

214
00:19:28,543 --> 00:19:29,961
And let me get this straight.

215
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:32,714
I have no intention of living
as some vampire's butler

216
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:35,300
just to keep a promise
made by my ancestor I don't even know.

217
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:36,342
Hold on.

218
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:40,930
If you do not wish to be my butler,

219
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:43,391
do you even have a place to stay?

220
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:45,977
What do you mean? This is my home.

221
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:49,480
This is a house
that I've rightfully inherited.

222
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:52,650
I cannot believe how shameless you are.

223
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:55,153
"Shameless"?

224
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:57,196
Who's calling who shameless?

225
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:01,784
If I sell this house without telling you,
do you even have a place to stay?

226
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:05,622
I'm warning you.

227
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,457
I can put up with everything else,

228
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,375
but don't you mess with this house.

229
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:11,628
And I can't put up with people
taking my money,

230
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:14,213
so work your ass off to pay me back.

231
00:20:23,598 --> 00:20:25,516
I'm messaging you regarding the coat.

232
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,352
Is this authentic?

233
00:20:27,602 --> 00:20:30,480
Of course, it's an authentic product
purchased at the department store.

234
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,523
May I see the receipt?

235
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:34,192
I don't have the receipt,

236
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:36,694
but it was only worn once,
so it's pretty much new.

237
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:39,489
I like the design and style, but...

238
00:20:40,615 --> 00:20:42,158
Is it because of the receipt?

239
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,953
I'm not sure if it'll suit me.

240
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:46,329
What the...

241
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:48,164
So will you buy it or not?

242
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:51,918
So you can sell things this way?

243
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:57,465
Then please think it over and let me know.

244
00:20:58,299 --> 00:20:59,217
I'll be honest.

245
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,552
I like the coat, but it's a bit expensive.

246
00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:03,096
Can I get a discount?

247
00:21:03,346 --> 00:21:04,180
I'm sorry.

248
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,348
You're stubborn like a mule.

249
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:07,767
What the...

250
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,936
Okay then. It's a deal. Let's meet up.

251
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:16,609
Go to Gongcheon Station
tomorrow at 2:00 p.m.

252
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:19,696
At 2:00 p.m.?

253
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:20,738
By myself?

254
00:21:22,532 --> 00:21:23,908
I have work tomorrow.

255
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,160
You bought it, so you sell it.

256
00:21:26,995 --> 00:21:27,954
Goodnight then.

257
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:30,206
I mean...

258
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,110
- Morning.
- Let's go.

259
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:01,612
DAEBAK BUTCHER SHOP

260
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,490
Hi.

261
00:22:04,574 --> 00:22:05,742
What?

262
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:08,161
Min-jae, who are you greeting?

263
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:11,831
Do you know her?

264
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:13,666
I don't think I've seen her before.

265
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:59,921
SCHOOL NURSE JOO IN-HAE

266
00:23:28,658 --> 00:23:29,784
Gongcheon Station at 2:00 p.m.

267
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:32,620
Find a man wearing a cap
and a long black puffer jacket.

268
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:35,123
Make sure he pays 800 000 won.

269
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:36,999
Do not give him a discount.

270
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:35,057
Excuse me.

271
00:24:35,892 --> 00:24:37,268
Dangun Market?

272
00:24:37,768 --> 00:24:38,769
- No.
- No.

273
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:52,950
What the...

274
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:56,078
They're all dressed the same.

275
00:25:01,042 --> 00:25:03,169
Dangun Market?

276
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:05,254
Dangun Market?

277
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:07,089
Dangun Market?

278
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,176
Dangun Market?

279
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,514
Dangun Market?

280
00:25:17,308 --> 00:25:19,977
Don't tell me he stood me up.

281
00:25:22,396 --> 00:25:23,606
Dangun Market?

282
00:25:24,815 --> 00:25:25,900
Yes, Dangun...

283
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,450
Woo-hyeol?

284
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:35,660
Sang-hae.

285
00:25:36,494 --> 00:25:37,453
What...

286
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:44,293
So something did happen.

287
00:25:45,962 --> 00:25:48,798
I thought you were avoiding us
because you became human.

288
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,593
Honestly, if I had become human,

289
00:25:53,636 --> 00:25:54,720
I would've avoided you.

290
00:25:55,388 --> 00:25:56,472
Woo-hyeol.

291
00:25:56,764 --> 00:25:59,225
How could you say that?

292
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:00,434
You're so harsh.

293
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:02,436
I was just kidding.

294
00:26:03,271 --> 00:26:05,940
You haven't changed a bit.

295
00:26:06,649 --> 00:26:08,567
And you still covet my clothes.

296
00:26:08,651 --> 00:26:11,654
I don't have money,
but I have a sense of fashion.

297
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:15,199
I'm not sure if I should say this, but...

298
00:26:15,283 --> 00:26:16,659
- Then don't.
- One, two, three.

299
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:18,077
I think I should.

300
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:22,790
Can you give me a discount?
I've wanted this coat for a long time.

301
00:26:23,416 --> 00:26:24,583
Never.

302
00:26:24,667 --> 00:26:27,128
She said I can't give you a discount.

303
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,297
Is she that scary?

304
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:36,012
Before that,
I'd like to ask you something.

305
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:38,472
What is it?

306
00:26:40,683 --> 00:26:41,934
- It's you, isn't it?
- What do you mean?

307
00:26:42,018 --> 00:26:44,103
The pieces of gold
buried beneath my coffin.

308
00:26:45,021 --> 00:26:46,022
You took them, didn't you?

309
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:50,109
What are you talking about?

310
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:51,777
It's okay.

311
00:26:52,236 --> 00:26:53,279
Just be honest.

312
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:55,906
- Is it really not you?
- What are you...

313
00:26:57,825 --> 00:26:59,952
saying right now?

314
00:27:00,328 --> 00:27:01,370
It's not me.

315
00:27:01,454 --> 00:27:04,081
I swear it's not me.

316
00:27:07,168 --> 00:27:08,878
Then who could it be?

317
00:27:11,047 --> 00:27:12,381
I doubt it was Dong-seop.

318
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:15,259
Butler Joo isn't the type
to do such a thing.

319
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:20,639
Why am I the only suspect here?

320
00:27:20,723 --> 00:27:22,224
Because you're suspicious.

321
00:27:22,767 --> 00:27:23,768
No way.

322
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,273
Look at you, the star of Gyeongseong,

323
00:27:29,357 --> 00:27:31,067
now selling secondhand items.

324
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,277
Seop will cry his heart out
if he sees you like this.

325
00:27:35,905 --> 00:27:39,200
"Woo-hyeol, how did you end up like this?"

326
00:27:41,786 --> 00:27:45,081
Woo-hyeol, how did you end up like this?

327
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:48,626
- Have you been well?
- Yes, as you can see.

328
00:27:50,503 --> 00:27:53,756
We visited the house on the day
you were supposed to wake up.

329
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:55,758
I can't believe you woke up one day early.

330
00:27:57,301 --> 00:27:58,177
Tell me about it.

331
00:27:58,677 --> 00:27:59,595
One second.

332
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:05,017
See? I told you.

333
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,455
You must be hungry.

334
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:27,706
Drink up.

335
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:32,545
What about me?
Is he the only vampire around here?

336
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:33,921
You're so petty.

337
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:42,721
I'm sorry, Woo-hyeol.

338
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:44,640
We should've checked up on you more,

339
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:45,975
but it's hard making ends meet.

340
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:49,395
Why should we apologize?
We're not the ones who opened the coffin.

341
00:28:51,105 --> 00:28:51,939
No, you're not.

342
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:53,983
Sang-hae is right.

343
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:56,193
You have no reason to apologize.

344
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:59,155
It's all my fault.

345
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:01,449
What are you, half-baked?

346
00:29:01,532 --> 00:29:04,034
I can't believe
you're half-human and half-vampire.

347
00:29:04,535 --> 00:29:05,828
What will you do now?

348
00:29:07,955 --> 00:29:10,374
As Mr. Ko said,

349
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,793
I will keep my eyes on her.

350
00:29:13,294 --> 00:29:14,503
There must be a way.

351
00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:17,923
Either way,
it's a relief that you're okay.

352
00:29:18,215 --> 00:29:20,301
I was worried sick about you.

353
00:29:21,135 --> 00:29:22,428
Thanks.

354
00:29:23,012 --> 00:29:24,847
The world has changed a lot

355
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:27,057
while you were in the coffin.

356
00:29:27,141 --> 00:29:29,185
Selling blood? It's been banned for ages.

357
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:30,895
Sucking human blood?

358
00:29:30,978 --> 00:29:32,313
You can't even dream of it.

359
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:34,607
CCTVs and dashcams are everywhere.

360
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:37,485
With scientific investigation,
they can even catch spirits.

361
00:29:38,027 --> 00:29:41,447
I've never sucked human blood
since the Third Battle of Seoul.

362
00:29:42,823 --> 00:29:45,868
How did the world become
such a harsh place?

363
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:48,204
It's all because of money.

364
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:51,665
People even give up on getting married
and having kids because it costs money.

365
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:53,918
The population is taking a nosedive.

366
00:29:55,336 --> 00:29:57,421
It's the worst famine in history for us.

367
00:29:57,505 --> 00:30:00,257
That pack of blood you drank
costs over 100 000 won.

368
00:30:00,341 --> 00:30:02,301
- Hey.
- 100 000 won?

369
00:30:03,052 --> 00:30:05,763
That's why you must be on your toes.

370
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:08,516
In this day and age,
vampires don't suck human blood.

371
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:11,560
Humans suck vampires dry.

372
00:30:11,644 --> 00:30:12,686
That's right.

373
00:30:13,229 --> 00:30:14,188
Speaking of which,

374
00:30:15,064 --> 00:30:18,734
do you have any money saved up
by any chance?

375
00:30:19,527 --> 00:30:21,028
- Money?
- Money?

376
00:30:21,111 --> 00:30:23,364
About five million won.

377
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:24,532
My gosh, Woo-hyeol.

378
00:30:28,202 --> 00:30:31,121
I have some money
I must pay back urgently.

379
00:30:31,205 --> 00:30:34,833
How could you already have a debt
when you just woke up?

380
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:36,335
And a whopping five million, at that.

381
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,837
Well, if five million is too much,

382
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,422
then how about a million?

383
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:43,634
I'm also neck-deep in debt
after starting this shop.

384
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:46,262
I almost forget.
I need to get back to cooking.

385
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:48,806
I've always been neck-deep in debt!

386
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:55,813
I see everyone has it rough.

387
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:59,650
REFRESH REAL ESTATE CONSULTING

388
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:03,696
We have purchased cheap old buildings
in deteriorated urban and industrial areas

389
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:06,115
and are giving them a makeover.

390
00:31:07,241 --> 00:31:09,493
With millennials and Gen Z
looking for new vibes,

391
00:31:09,577 --> 00:31:10,744
retro designs and...

392
00:31:11,245 --> 00:31:12,746
Do you have a place to stay?

393
00:31:13,998 --> 00:31:15,624
Yes, I do.

394
00:31:17,084 --> 00:31:18,669
Does she really have a place to stay?

395
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:21,630
The area doesn't have
much foot traffic yet,

396
00:31:21,714 --> 00:31:23,090
but the potential is high.

397
00:31:23,173 --> 00:31:26,427
It is certain to boom in the near future.

398
00:31:26,927 --> 00:31:28,929
They caught the crook
you mentioned last time.

399
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:31,390
They caught him?

400
00:31:48,157 --> 00:31:50,200
MISSING PERSON
NAME: JOO DONG-IL

401
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:12,723
Do-sik.

402
00:32:13,223 --> 00:32:16,310
I was in the area
to check on the construction.

403
00:32:19,897 --> 00:32:21,231
Are you packing up?

404
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:23,442
Yes.

405
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:26,987
Oh, come on in.

406
00:32:27,488 --> 00:32:28,572
Okay.

407
00:32:34,703 --> 00:32:36,372
I heard the crook got caught.

408
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:39,083
Yes, how did you know?

409
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:41,669
Well, I'm somewhat involved in the case.

410
00:32:42,336 --> 00:32:43,420
Anyway, it's a relief.

411
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:52,638
Go away!

412
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:57,476
There it goes again! Where is it?

413
00:32:57,559 --> 00:32:59,812
Where is it?

414
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:03,982
- Are you okay?
- Where...

415
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:09,780
I'm sorry.

416
00:33:10,698 --> 00:33:12,950
I'm not good with cockroaches.

417
00:33:13,784 --> 00:33:16,286
You knocked down a criminal,
but you're afraid of cockroaches?

418
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:18,414
I'm not the one who...

419
00:33:19,248 --> 00:33:20,332
I mean,

420
00:33:20,958 --> 00:33:23,711
all crooks must be punished.

421
00:33:24,294 --> 00:33:25,587
But don't do that next time.

422
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:27,756
You're more important than money.

423
00:33:28,132 --> 00:33:29,508
What if things went wrong?

424
00:33:32,136 --> 00:33:33,762
The taped boxes are good to go, right?

425
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,223
I got it, Do-sik.

426
00:33:36,473 --> 00:33:37,725
You needed a cab anyway.

427
00:33:39,143 --> 00:33:40,310
Just buy me coffee.

428
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:42,771
It's your lucky day.

429
00:33:57,828 --> 00:33:59,413
Are you sure you have time for this?

430
00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:01,707
I know you're busy.

431
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:02,875
That's not true.

432
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:06,170
- Sorry?
- I'm not as busy as you think.

433
00:34:07,713 --> 00:34:08,797
I'm my own boss.

434
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:14,511
I read your interview a while ago.

435
00:34:14,595 --> 00:34:16,597
Oh, you did?

436
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:20,517
"The newtro leader, CEO Shin Do-sik
of Refresh Real Estate Consulting."

437
00:34:22,478 --> 00:34:24,813
You're very popular.

438
00:34:25,439 --> 00:34:26,356
Not at all.

439
00:34:27,274 --> 00:34:28,192
You're embarrassing me.

440
00:34:29,485 --> 00:34:31,528
By the way,
how did you get your new place?

441
00:34:32,613 --> 00:34:35,657
I doubt you already got your money back
from that crook.

442
00:34:37,034 --> 00:34:38,076
Well...

443
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:42,039
I inherited it.

444
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:44,291
You inherited it?

445
00:34:54,176 --> 00:34:56,011
This is the place you inherited?

446
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:58,305
Yes, it's this house.

447
00:34:58,388 --> 00:35:00,390
It's more like a mansion.

448
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:03,101
I didn't know
such an old house like this still existed.

449
00:35:03,185 --> 00:35:04,228
It's cool.

450
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:07,189
Thank you for helping me today.

451
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:08,774
Don't worry about it.

452
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:10,901
I'll help you with the boxes.

453
00:35:10,984 --> 00:35:12,611
No, I got it. It's okay.

454
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:32,714
Drive safe.

455
00:35:33,215 --> 00:35:34,800
Thank you so much.

456
00:35:34,883 --> 00:35:35,968
Hey.

457
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:40,180
Butler Joo.

458
00:35:47,855 --> 00:35:48,730
Who is he?

459
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:51,483
- Well, he's--
- Greetings.

460
00:35:52,234 --> 00:35:54,611
What brings you to our house?

461
00:35:57,322 --> 00:35:59,491
Right, well...

462
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:01,952
He was acquainted with my ancestor.

463
00:36:02,953 --> 00:36:05,247
He's staying here for a while
due to personal reasons.

464
00:36:07,291 --> 00:36:10,252
Hello, I'm In-hae's college friend,
Shin Do-sik.

465
00:36:12,379 --> 00:36:13,630
I am Seon Woo-hyeol.

466
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,344
Why are you so surprised?

467
00:36:19,428 --> 00:36:20,554
Your hand...

468
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:22,472
is quite cold.

469
00:36:25,976 --> 00:36:27,603
Cold hypersensitivity!

470
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:29,438
That's what it is.

471
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:32,316
He must have poor blood circulation.

472
00:36:33,066 --> 00:36:35,694
I'm sure you're busy,
so you should get going.

473
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:36,945
Thank you.

474
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:39,740
Sure.

475
00:36:40,449 --> 00:36:41,450
I'll get going then.

476
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:43,243
Okay, goodbye.

477
00:37:04,181 --> 00:37:05,140
We'll talk inside.

478
00:37:07,893 --> 00:37:08,936
Why inside?

479
00:37:18,028 --> 00:37:19,154
- Listen--
- Here.

480
00:37:20,948 --> 00:37:21,782
Damn it.

481
00:37:21,865 --> 00:37:24,534
Why would you butt in there?

482
00:37:24,618 --> 00:37:25,661
"Butler Joo"?

483
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:26,745
Have you lost it?

484
00:37:27,663 --> 00:37:28,789
What did I do wrong?

485
00:37:29,206 --> 00:37:31,625
And what was that handshake for?

486
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:32,793
Are you running for office?

487
00:37:32,876 --> 00:37:35,045
What kind of vampire
loves attention so much?

488
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:38,465
Can't vampires love attention?

489
00:37:39,132 --> 00:37:41,385
In your opinion,
what should a vampire be like?

490
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:44,930
Hiding and avoiding people,

491
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:48,183
being isolated, lonely, depressed,
or something like that.

492
00:37:49,643 --> 00:37:50,894
Try getting as old as I am.

493
00:37:50,978 --> 00:37:52,813
How can anyone live in hiding,

494
00:37:52,896 --> 00:37:55,941
feeling isolated, depressed, and lonely
for so long?

495
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:08,370
- I am Seon Woo-hyeol.
- I wasn't asking for a handshake.

496
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:09,830
I want my money.

497
00:38:09,913 --> 00:38:12,082
The money you got after selling that coat.

498
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:13,208
Right.

499
00:38:14,334 --> 00:38:15,293
Fine.

500
00:38:29,683 --> 00:38:32,185
That's why you must be on your toes.

501
00:38:32,269 --> 00:38:34,855
In this day and age,
vampires don't suck human blood.

502
00:38:34,938 --> 00:38:37,899
Humans suck vampires dry.

503
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,288
There's 50 000 won missing.

504
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:52,289
What?

505
00:38:54,291 --> 00:38:57,169
That's not possible.

506
00:38:57,252 --> 00:38:59,379
Didn't you count the money
when you received it?

507
00:38:59,463 --> 00:39:01,048
Did you just take what they gave you?

508
00:39:02,591 --> 00:39:04,426
Sang-hae, that little brat.

509
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:06,887
Gosh, this is frustrating.

510
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:10,098
I was too distracted
to say this yesterday,

511
00:39:10,182 --> 00:39:11,641
but write me an IOU.

512
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:14,061
An IOU?

513
00:39:14,144 --> 00:39:15,437
For my card bill.

514
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,230
I get that you're a vampire,

515
00:39:17,314 --> 00:39:19,274
but that doesn't give you
the right to use my card.

516
00:39:19,775 --> 00:39:21,943
You think you can get away
with spending my money?

517
00:39:22,569 --> 00:39:23,403
Look here.

518
00:39:23,487 --> 00:39:25,781
I think we're even here.

519
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:28,033
Because you opened my coffin a day early--

520
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:29,493
How much time do you need?

521
00:39:29,576 --> 00:39:31,036
Three months? Six?

522
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:32,454
Fine, six months.

523
00:39:33,455 --> 00:39:35,040
Write it yourself.

524
00:39:38,502 --> 00:39:40,587
If only my gold
had still been there, I would--

525
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,923
Then go find it.

526
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,299
Go.

527
00:39:51,223 --> 00:39:52,349
Fine.

528
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:54,226
I'll write you an IOU.

529
00:39:54,935 --> 00:39:56,895
Bring me a brush and an inkstone.

530
00:39:56,978 --> 00:39:58,146
Just use a pen

531
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:00,023
before I hit you with an inkstone.

532
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,203
All right, Butler Joo.

533
00:40:14,037 --> 00:40:15,330
Here you go.

534
00:40:16,957 --> 00:40:21,837
I, Seon Woo-hyeol, will pay back
Joo In-hae within six months.

535
00:40:22,254 --> 00:40:23,922
Sure. Great handwriting.

536
00:40:25,882 --> 00:40:27,717
Anyway, keep your promise.

537
00:40:28,135 --> 00:40:31,304
Or else, I'll sell this house
and take off.

538
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,014
Never.

539
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:37,018
So make sure to pay me back at all costs.

540
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:49,573
Should I just bite her?

541
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,424
INTERNAL MEDICINE

542
00:41:09,259 --> 00:41:11,386
What brings you to our house?

543
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,597
He was acquainted with my ancestor.

544
00:41:14,264 --> 00:41:17,058
He's staying here for a while
due to personal reasons.

545
00:41:17,142 --> 00:41:18,602
- Hello.
- I am Seon Woo-hyeol.

546
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:21,438
Acquainted with her ancestor?

547
00:41:28,695 --> 00:41:31,573
TAROT, FORTUNE-TELLING

548
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:34,367
Pick one.

549
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:51,009
Based on the card you picked,

550
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:52,844
you're not the one keeping an eye on her.

551
00:41:52,928 --> 00:41:54,930
It's the other way around.

552
00:41:57,057 --> 00:42:00,018
She's going to sell the house
if I don't pay her back.

553
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:01,436
Oh, money?

554
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:03,939
Then you should make an ID first.

555
00:42:04,356 --> 00:42:05,190
An ID?

556
00:42:06,316 --> 00:42:07,192
Here.

557
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:09,402
You need something like this.

558
00:42:10,362 --> 00:42:13,406
Without an ID, you can't find work.

559
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:18,703
It seems like yesterday
that we used identification plaques.

560
00:42:18,787 --> 00:42:20,372
Times sure have changed.

561
00:42:22,499 --> 00:42:24,292
If I have an ID like yours,

562
00:42:25,585 --> 00:42:28,463
can I start using my cell phone?

563
00:42:29,422 --> 00:42:31,424
When did you buy this?

564
00:42:33,843 --> 00:42:35,178
Then let's take a photo first.

565
00:42:35,262 --> 00:42:36,554
All right.

566
00:42:46,648 --> 00:42:48,817
A little to the left, Woo-hyeol.

567
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,485
A little to the right. Stop.

568
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:51,945
Now squat down.

569
00:42:52,445 --> 00:42:57,075
Keep going.

570
00:42:57,158 --> 00:42:58,034
Stop.

571
00:43:00,412 --> 00:43:02,706
All right. Come on, smile.

572
00:43:03,206 --> 00:43:04,124
Never mind, don't smile.

573
00:43:04,207 --> 00:43:05,500
Here we go. One, two.

574
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:06,418
You little...

575
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:10,755
IDENTIFICATION CARD
SEON WOO-HYEOL

576
00:43:14,884 --> 00:43:17,512
Who knew you were good at something?

577
00:43:18,388 --> 00:43:20,015
How would you like to pay, sir?

578
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,101
You took my 50 000 won,
so let's call it even.

579
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:28,148
This costs at least 500 000 won!

580
00:43:28,231 --> 00:43:29,941
Then you shouldn't have scammed me.

581
00:43:34,571 --> 00:43:37,157
Have you thought about how to find work?

582
00:43:41,453 --> 00:43:42,287
I'm not sure.

583
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:44,372
Then follow me.

584
00:43:47,042 --> 00:43:48,043
To where?

585
00:43:53,298 --> 00:43:54,549
Where are we going?

586
00:43:56,176 --> 00:43:57,594
You said you have to make money.

587
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:01,890
Come on.

588
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:05,727
EMPLOYMENT AGENCY

589
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:16,279
Goodness, he's very good-looking.

590
00:44:19,616 --> 00:44:22,369
Would there be any work he can do?

591
00:44:22,452 --> 00:44:24,120
There's plenty.

592
00:44:24,704 --> 00:44:25,830
You have an ID?

593
00:44:34,297 --> 00:44:35,340
Here.

594
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,343
All right, let's see here.

595
00:44:39,219 --> 00:44:41,846
- What type of job are you looking for?
- Anything is fine.

596
00:44:42,806 --> 00:44:43,681
Right?

597
00:44:47,185 --> 00:44:48,520
If possible,

598
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:51,231
it'd be great if I could wear a suit.

599
00:44:53,108 --> 00:44:54,526
As you can see,

600
00:44:54,609 --> 00:44:56,403
I look great in suits.

601
00:45:07,831 --> 00:45:10,083
I feel dizzy

602
00:45:10,166 --> 00:45:12,127
from smelling the incense for hours.

603
00:45:12,919 --> 00:45:15,672
You wanted to work with a suit on
and you're doing exactly that.

604
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:27,308
Some more slices of pork please.

605
00:45:31,896 --> 00:45:33,565
Coming right up.

606
00:45:37,026 --> 00:45:37,944
Mister.

607
00:45:38,361 --> 00:45:39,362
Hurry and serve this.

608
00:45:39,779 --> 00:45:40,947
Hurry.

609
00:45:58,214 --> 00:45:59,507
Hold on.

610
00:46:00,884 --> 00:46:03,553
Why isn't he cleaning up with me?
Where did he go?

611
00:46:26,075 --> 00:46:27,368
Are you guys even human?

612
00:46:27,619 --> 00:46:28,745
Get lost this instant!

613
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:34,626
Woo-hyeol.

614
00:46:35,293 --> 00:46:36,711
I know you were exhausted,

615
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:39,088
but how could you sleep
in someone else's coffin?

616
00:46:39,506 --> 00:46:42,675
They say lacquer coffins are nice,
so I wanted to give it a try.

617
00:46:43,718 --> 00:46:45,136
Will you ever make any money?

618
00:46:47,889 --> 00:46:50,016
Is there any other type of work I can do?

619
00:46:50,767 --> 00:46:52,435
Rather than smelling incense all day,

620
00:46:52,519 --> 00:46:54,896
I'd love to be outdoors,
getting some fresh air.

621
00:46:56,272 --> 00:46:57,232
My gosh.

622
00:46:58,066 --> 00:46:59,817
You're unbelievable.

623
00:47:20,296 --> 00:47:21,631
What is that thing?

624
00:47:22,924 --> 00:47:23,967
A vehicle.

625
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:26,511
A vehicle?

626
00:47:29,597 --> 00:47:32,475
- Woo-hyeol, this is great.
- It is indeed.

627
00:47:34,394 --> 00:47:36,604
We normally don't hire men for the job,

628
00:47:36,688 --> 00:47:39,983
but you gentlemen look so friendly,
so I'm making an exception.

629
00:47:40,066 --> 00:47:41,484
- Hello.
- Good luck.

630
00:47:42,110 --> 00:47:43,486
DAIRY DRINK

631
00:48:03,047 --> 00:48:05,258
Excuse me. One dairy drink please.

632
00:48:08,428 --> 00:48:09,429
Bless you.

633
00:48:20,356 --> 00:48:21,190
Oh, no.

634
00:48:21,482 --> 00:48:22,609
Goodness.

635
00:48:22,692 --> 00:48:23,735
Oh, no, the cooler.

636
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:24,819
Goodness.

637
00:48:28,615 --> 00:48:29,991
Are you okay, ma'am?

638
00:48:31,326 --> 00:48:32,160
What?

639
00:48:33,828 --> 00:48:35,163
You're a sir, not a ma'am.

640
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:38,833
You're laughing?

641
00:48:40,168 --> 00:48:41,210
You little brat.

642
00:48:41,628 --> 00:48:43,379
Hurry up and pick these up. Now!

643
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:52,513
I don't want to.

644
00:48:54,557 --> 00:48:56,017
This little brat.

645
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:02,148
That little brat.

646
00:49:03,274 --> 00:49:04,233
Hey, you!

647
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:13,868
Goodness.

648
00:49:17,538 --> 00:49:18,998
What's wrong with you?

649
00:49:20,166 --> 00:49:22,377
I got you a job at a funeral service,
and he slept inside a coffin.

650
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:24,170
I pleaded with the dairy company

651
00:49:24,253 --> 00:49:26,881
and got you a job delivering dairy drinks,
and he messed that up as well.

652
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:28,966
He's still adjusting, so...

653
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:33,179
I'm about to get fired because of you!

654
00:49:33,262 --> 00:49:34,138
Please calm down.

655
00:49:34,222 --> 00:49:35,640
You know me, sir.

656
00:49:35,723 --> 00:49:37,934
Could you please give us one last chance?

657
00:49:38,017 --> 00:49:39,852
Never! Dream on!

658
00:49:40,353 --> 00:49:42,313
Who knows what you'll do next?

659
00:49:42,397 --> 00:49:43,272
Wait.

660
00:49:43,356 --> 00:49:45,483
What about the money
for the hours we worked?

661
00:49:45,566 --> 00:49:47,527
Money? What money?

662
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:49,904
You should be relieved
that I'm not filing for damages!

663
00:49:50,196 --> 00:49:51,197
Damn it!

664
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,865
- Wait.
- Goodness.

665
00:49:52,949 --> 00:49:54,325
Sir.

666
00:50:06,671 --> 00:50:08,131
Is he meditating or what?

667
00:50:08,214 --> 00:50:10,383
It's cold. He should go home.

668
00:50:10,633 --> 00:50:12,510
Why is he sitting out in this cold?

669
00:50:12,593 --> 00:50:13,886
Is this some kind of performance?

670
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:19,976
It can't be.

671
00:50:22,979 --> 00:50:24,439
This isn't the time to sit back.

672
00:50:39,245 --> 00:50:40,163
Gosh.

673
00:50:43,541 --> 00:50:44,542
Goodness.

674
00:50:53,301 --> 00:50:54,385
Goodness.

675
00:50:56,262 --> 00:50:58,181
Why do you look so tired?

676
00:50:59,348 --> 00:51:02,059
I tried this and that to make money,

677
00:51:02,727 --> 00:51:04,020
but it's not easy.

678
00:51:04,103 --> 00:51:05,062
Of course not.

679
00:51:05,146 --> 00:51:06,564
Making money is no easy feat.

680
00:51:06,898 --> 00:51:09,025
Be ready to sell your soul to make money.

681
00:51:12,653 --> 00:51:14,071
You sound like the Devil.

682
00:51:14,155 --> 00:51:15,615
You're scaring me.

683
00:51:16,616 --> 00:51:17,617
Here, take this.

684
00:51:18,242 --> 00:51:19,327
I'll help you make money.

685
00:51:22,997 --> 00:51:24,123
All right.

686
00:51:24,207 --> 00:51:25,708
Let's begin cleaning.

687
00:51:25,792 --> 00:51:27,960
If you help me,
I'll forget about the 50 000 won.

688
00:51:28,753 --> 00:51:30,630
- Cleaning?
- Shall we begin?

689
00:51:31,506 --> 00:51:32,757
Where do we start?

690
00:51:33,341 --> 00:51:34,509
What are you talking about?

691
00:51:35,134 --> 00:51:36,844
Shall we start with these?

692
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:52,944
Butler Joo.

693
00:52:12,588 --> 00:52:14,006
Let's uncover the rest.

694
00:52:17,051 --> 00:52:20,096
What are you doing?
Stop standing in the middle of the dust.

695
00:52:47,957 --> 00:52:49,458
Hold on.

696
00:52:50,293 --> 00:52:52,086
- Change into slippers.
- What?

697
00:52:53,421 --> 00:52:54,255
Here.

698
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:55,756
Change into these.

699
00:52:56,424 --> 00:52:57,300
What are these?

700
00:52:57,383 --> 00:52:58,509
Hurry up.

701
00:53:32,418 --> 00:53:34,503
The house looks much better
now that it's clean.

702
00:53:36,297 --> 00:53:37,214
Good job today.

703
00:53:40,343 --> 00:53:41,510
You too.

704
00:53:41,594 --> 00:53:42,553
Well done.

705
00:53:46,432 --> 00:53:49,060
How long have you lived here?

706
00:53:51,187 --> 00:53:53,814
Well, this area used to be a forest

707
00:53:54,899 --> 00:53:57,610
a long time ago.

708
00:53:59,111 --> 00:54:00,821
And this place

709
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:03,616
was a small hut.

710
00:54:04,992 --> 00:54:06,535
Since then,

711
00:54:07,453 --> 00:54:09,080
it's been around 400 years.

712
00:54:09,872 --> 00:54:10,706
Really?

713
00:54:11,082 --> 00:54:12,124
That long?

714
00:54:21,801 --> 00:54:23,219
Why did you settle here?

715
00:54:24,053 --> 00:54:26,973
I'm sure there were other houses
that were fancier and had a better view.

716
00:54:32,186 --> 00:54:33,604
I'm waiting for someone.

717
00:54:34,814 --> 00:54:36,107
You're waiting for someone?

718
00:54:39,694 --> 00:54:40,653
This used to be

719
00:54:41,487 --> 00:54:42,697
our secret hideout

720
00:54:43,197 --> 00:54:44,448
that only the two of us knew.

721
00:54:52,581 --> 00:54:53,582
Hold on.

722
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:02,550
Here.

723
00:55:02,633 --> 00:55:03,509
Thanks.

724
00:55:07,513 --> 00:55:08,514
It's well-cooked.

725
00:55:15,021 --> 00:55:16,105
It's delicious.

726
00:55:26,115 --> 00:55:27,116
What was that?

727
00:55:32,872 --> 00:55:34,081
I believe that they'll come back...

728
00:55:35,624 --> 00:55:36,667
no matter what.

729
00:55:50,556 --> 00:55:51,557
By the way,

730
00:55:52,975 --> 00:55:53,809
are you

731
00:55:55,269 --> 00:55:56,145
not afraid of me?

732
00:55:59,315 --> 00:56:01,609
I'm more afraid of humans than vampires.

733
00:56:02,985 --> 00:56:04,403
Didn't you see last time?

734
00:56:04,737 --> 00:56:07,656
On top of taking my money,
that jerk even attempted to kill me.

735
00:56:12,286 --> 00:56:14,205
I'm not that afraid of you.

736
00:56:15,456 --> 00:56:18,042
If you wanted to kill me,
you would've done so already.

737
00:56:18,751 --> 00:56:20,169
But you didn't.

738
00:56:21,337 --> 00:56:23,339
Rather, you saved me from death.

739
00:56:28,427 --> 00:56:30,304
How did you find me that day?

740
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:32,098
- Sorry?
- How did you know

741
00:56:32,181 --> 00:56:34,809
I was there?

742
00:56:38,187 --> 00:56:39,105
Right.

743
00:56:43,651 --> 00:56:44,527
I just...

744
00:56:45,319 --> 00:56:46,195
felt it.

745
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:50,116
No need to stare at me like that.

746
00:56:51,117 --> 00:56:54,161
Let's just say I saved you in return
for the noodles you bought me last time.

747
00:57:00,501 --> 00:57:01,627
Noodles?

748
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:04,755
Are you saying that my life
is worth a cup of noodles?

749
00:57:37,163 --> 00:57:38,164
Are you...

750
00:57:39,999 --> 00:57:41,292
not afraid of me?

751
00:57:42,251 --> 00:57:44,420
You saved me from death.

752
00:57:47,214 --> 00:57:48,299
But still.

753
00:57:50,217 --> 00:57:51,177
I'm...

754
00:57:52,136 --> 00:57:53,470
not human.

755
00:57:55,222 --> 00:57:56,182
I'm a vampire.

756
00:57:58,392 --> 00:58:01,020
You're not a monster, Woo-hyeol.

757
00:58:01,937 --> 00:58:04,648
You're my savior

758
00:58:05,774 --> 00:58:07,610
and my one and only friend.

759
00:58:50,402 --> 00:58:52,154
What is this doing here?

760
00:58:59,995 --> 00:59:01,330
Dad, don't go.

761
00:59:04,166 --> 00:59:06,752
I won't be too long.

762
00:59:12,508 --> 00:59:13,384
Here.

763
00:59:15,177 --> 00:59:16,262
Hold on to this.

764
00:59:16,345 --> 00:59:17,680
I will come back for you.

765
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:20,474
Keep it safe until then, okay?

766
00:59:29,775 --> 00:59:30,776
All right.

767
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:32,861
I'll be back.

768
00:59:44,081 --> 00:59:45,374
Sometimes, it took a day.

769
00:59:46,041 --> 00:59:47,459
Sometimes, it took a week.

770
00:59:48,168 --> 00:59:49,712
And sometimes, it took a month.

771
00:59:52,506 --> 00:59:54,717
Every time my dad left
after giving me this pocket watch,

772
00:59:55,217 --> 00:59:57,803
he came back without fail.

773
01:00:02,641 --> 01:00:03,934
I believe that they'll come back.

774
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:40,614
HEARTBEAT

775
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:41,907
Have you lost your mind?!

776
01:01:42,324 --> 01:01:45,160
Her lip was bleeding.
I couldn't help myself.

777
01:01:45,244 --> 01:01:46,870
No way. Are you saying you kissed her?

778
01:01:46,954 --> 01:01:49,665
I felt Hae-sun in Butler Joo's blood.

779
01:01:49,748 --> 01:01:51,500
Hae-sun allowed me to drink her blood.

780
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,086
We're good then.
I'll pretend a mosquito bit my lip.

781
01:01:54,169 --> 01:01:55,170
- Hey!
- What?!

782
01:01:55,254 --> 01:01:57,256
From their looks to their conduct,

783
01:01:57,339 --> 01:01:58,882
they couldn't be more different.

784
01:01:58,966 --> 01:02:00,342
- Why?!
- I can't believe I felt

785
01:02:00,426 --> 01:02:01,468
Hae-sun in her blood.

786
01:02:01,844 --> 01:02:03,303
Welcome, Ms. Na.

787
01:02:04,179 --> 01:02:05,764
Is it because of your
family's medical history?

788
01:02:05,848 --> 01:02:07,057
Let it at least be you

789
01:02:07,141 --> 01:02:08,809
who breaks this damned curse.

790
01:02:08,892 --> 01:02:11,520
Drink her blood after she falls in love,

791
01:02:12,271 --> 01:02:14,606
and you will become human.

792
