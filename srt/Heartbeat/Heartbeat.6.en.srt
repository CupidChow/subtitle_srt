00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:45,296
HEARTBEAT

2
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,298
ALL CHARACTERS, NAMES,
ORGANIZATIONS, GROUPS, EVENTS,

3
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,383
AND SETTINGS ARE FICTITIOUS
AND ANIMAL SAFETY GUIDELINES WERE FOLLOWED

4
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:19,705
Butler Joo?

5
00:01:20,331 --> 00:01:21,707
What are you doing down here?

6
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:23,667
You startled me.

7
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:25,878
I didn't hear you come in.

8
00:01:26,796 --> 00:01:28,923
Must I knock when entering my room?

9
00:01:30,382 --> 00:01:31,884
What are you doing here?

10
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:34,637
I'm sorry.

11
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,639
So what happened was...

12
00:01:44,647 --> 00:01:45,815
Is this her?

13
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:48,776
The woman you're waiting for?

14
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,825
Yes, it is.

15
00:02:14,927 --> 00:02:16,095
What would happen...

16
00:02:19,265 --> 00:02:20,391
What would happen

17
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:24,520
if I really was her in my former life?

18
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,733
Would you fall in love with me?

19
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,799
Why do you ask when
your current life is exhausting enough

20
00:02:53,883 --> 00:02:55,593
and you can't be bothered with past lives?

21
00:02:57,136 --> 00:02:58,637
Did you have a change of heart?

22
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:02,266
No, I still stand by what I said.

23
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,435
But she's gorgeous.

24
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:05,519
She is.

25
00:03:05,603 --> 00:03:08,522
No wonder you've been chasing her
for centuries.

26
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:13,611
Just out of curiosity,

27
00:03:13,903 --> 00:03:15,821
what about me reminds you of her?

28
00:03:15,905 --> 00:03:17,656
The woman in the drawing, I mean.

29
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,741
I already told you.

30
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:21,785
From head to toe,
you have nothing in common.

31
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:27,207
You asked if I'd love you

32
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:29,293
if you really were her.

33
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:32,296
Here's my answer.

34
00:03:34,757 --> 00:03:35,925
It won't happen.

35
00:03:36,634 --> 00:03:37,968
Because you're not Hae-sun.

36
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:43,933
But you said you felt something
in my blood.

37
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:45,517
You're changing your stance.

38
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:47,186
You seem upset to hear

39
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:49,313
that it won't happen.

40
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:52,483
It's nothing like that.

41
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:55,861
You keep changing your mind,
so I just want to clarify things.

42
00:03:58,197 --> 00:03:59,198
Fine.

43
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:02,534
I did sense Hae-sun in your blood,

44
00:04:02,618 --> 00:04:05,746
but there was one thing
that was certainly different.

45
00:04:06,622 --> 00:04:07,665
Which is?

46
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:13,504
Your blood...

47
00:04:16,382 --> 00:04:17,383
Forget it.

48
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,426
Jeez, what is it?

49
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,970
Finish your sentence.

50
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:25,015
Your blood...

51
00:04:29,228 --> 00:04:30,646
is full of poison.

52
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:34,608
What?

53
00:04:34,692 --> 00:04:36,944
It's far too poisonous

54
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:39,113
even for a vampire to drink.

55
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:42,533
There isn't any warmth to it.

56
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:44,118
None whatsoever.

57
00:04:44,702 --> 00:04:45,703
That's why

58
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,496
you're not Hae-sun.

59
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:49,832
So don't even dream about it.

60
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:55,045
Hold on.

61
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:56,255
People have told me

62
00:04:57,715 --> 00:05:00,300
that I can be as tough as nails,

63
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:03,178
but never have I heard
of my blood being full of poison.

64
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:06,265
I haven't come across
blood like yours before either.

65
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:09,643
Fine. It's for the best.

66
00:05:09,727 --> 00:05:13,147
My blood is too poisonous for a vampire,
so that'll keep me safe from you.

67
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,356
"Safe from me"?

68
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:17,234
I don't go around
blindly drinking human blood.

69
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,528
See? You're changing your stance again.

70
00:05:19,737 --> 00:05:21,864
You sensed something in my blood.

71
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:23,240
You said so yourself!

72
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,035
Right.

73
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:29,955
I apologize for that.

74
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:33,417
Old habits die hard.

75
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:36,295
- What?
- My blood is poisonous?

76
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:38,797
Says the one who sucked on my blood
like a mosquito.

77
00:05:40,466 --> 00:05:41,467
Hold on.

78
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:44,011
Why are you home already?

79
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:45,471
Shouldn't you be at work?

80
00:05:46,722 --> 00:05:47,848
I quit.

81
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:50,017
Why?

82
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:52,102
You liked your job.

83
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:56,273
There was a contract school nurse,

84
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:58,358
but I already kicked her out.

85
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:00,027
Don't worry.

86
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:02,404
I'll have her hired no matter what,

87
00:06:02,488 --> 00:06:04,573
so tell her not to worry
about the interview.

88
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,368
There's no need to thank me.

89
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:11,080
What are friends for?

90
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:17,836
Who the hell did that?

91
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:20,881
You!

92
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:24,468
Hey, you!

93
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:26,261
Have you lost your mind?

94
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,764
How could you dump water on him?

95
00:06:31,517 --> 00:06:32,893
Should I not have done it?

96
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:36,230
If you were going to do it,
you should've dumped toilet water.

97
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:43,070
That's disgusting.

98
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:44,113
Serves him right.

99
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:46,615
You seem to have a thing
for disgusting things.

100
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:49,785
I can't believe
you thought of that. No way.

101
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:59,461
Right, well...

102
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:02,673
I admit what you did feels good and all,

103
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:06,510
but what do we do from here?

104
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:11,306
We can't both be jobless.

105
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:13,308
Tell me about it.

106
00:07:15,561 --> 00:07:17,855
I miss my Shaded Oasis days.

107
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:20,107
Sorry?

108
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:26,029
- Shaded Oasis.
- What's that?

109
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:30,659
This mansion

110
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:32,119
was once a place

111
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,538
for men and women to get together and...

112
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:40,210
People these days
would've called it a "hot spot."

113
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,171
That's what it used to be.

114
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,383
Back in the day, I ran the place

115
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:48,218
and made quite a lot of money.

116
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:52,806
I wonder how a hotshot ended up like this.

117
00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:04,109
HEARTBEAT
EPISODE 6

118
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:11,491
What would happen

119
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:15,329
if I really was her in my former life?

120
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:19,208
Would you fall in love with me?

121
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:24,463
You must be out of your mind.

122
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,598
RÉSUMÉ

123
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:37,851
Because you're not Hae-sun.

124
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:39,394
Your blood...

125
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,399
is full of poison.

126
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:52,824
Why am I being bothered by this?

127
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:55,285
As if that's important right now.

128
00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:56,745
Just focus on getting a job.

129
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:20,852
Would you fall in love with me?

130
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:29,111
No.

131
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:31,363
That would never happen.

132
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,714
Yes, Attorney Park.

133
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:53,802
So only the property
was inherited with no debts?

134
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:00,976
All right, good work.

135
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:11,862
INTERVIEW ROOM

136
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,954
I see you worked at Gongcheon High School.

137
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:22,956
- Yes.
- The principal there

138
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,291
is a college friend of mine.

139
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:26,752
JUHYEON HIGH SCHOOL

140
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:27,753
WE REGRET TO INFORM YOU

141
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:29,713
THAT YOU FAILED THE INTERVIEW

142
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:32,966
I will do my best for the students
as the school nurse.

143
00:10:36,345 --> 00:10:39,222
Do you always look so serious, Ms. Joo?

144
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:43,060
- Sorry?
- With that look on your face,

145
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:45,354
students wouldn't feel comfortable
visiting you.

146
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:47,356
HAESOO HIGH SCHOOL

147
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:48,815
WE REGRET TO INFORM YOU

148
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:50,734
THAT YOU FAILED THE FINAL INTERVIEW

149
00:11:08,043 --> 00:11:09,211
Hey, Do-sik.

150
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:13,090
Right now?

151
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:19,846
She's not an easy one.

152
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:23,392
It might be faster for you to become human
by going in the hawthorn coffin

153
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:24,893
for another 100 years.

154
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:29,731
Mr. Ko told me not to rely on luck.

155
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,359
I need to touch her heart.

156
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:37,489
That being said,

157
00:11:38,115 --> 00:11:39,950
do you think there would be a job for me?

158
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:43,412
Nothing works better than money

159
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:45,914
to touch her heart.

160
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:48,375
I'll get the job done this time
without any hiccups.

161
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:50,252
- Woo-hyeol.
- Yes?

162
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:52,921
You should know
that trust is key to everything.

163
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,881
How can you ask me to get you a job

164
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:57,843
when you caused
all that trouble last time?

165
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:01,304
Because of you,
I completely lost their trust!

166
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:04,391
To be honest,

167
00:12:05,142 --> 00:12:08,145
I thought we'd be financially better off
once you woke up.

168
00:12:08,854 --> 00:12:12,482
Because you are our leader and boss.

169
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:15,986
But it turns out, I was wrong.

170
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:19,614
How can you have it worse than us?

171
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:21,450
We even had to lend you our clothes.

172
00:12:24,286 --> 00:12:26,705
What happened to the great Seon Woo-hyeol

173
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:28,206
who reigned over Gyeongseong?

174
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,752
Goodness, tell me about it.

175
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:35,172
What's going on?

176
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:41,761
Is something going on?

177
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:46,016
Seop!

178
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:47,767
What's going on?

179
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:49,686
- Please enjoy.
- What the...

180
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:51,396
Who's next?

181
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,148
Here you go.

182
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:54,608
Thank you. Please come again.

183
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:55,984
Next.

184
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:06,912
VAMPIRE TTEOKBOKKI

185
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:09,956
The spiciest level please.

186
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:12,125
- Of course.
- Thank you.

187
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:13,210
- Thank you.
- Please enjoy.

188
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:14,920
Dong-seop Snack Shop is better.

189
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:16,296
- Stop it.
- Thank you.

190
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:28,266
- This place is great.
- We have levels one to three.

191
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:30,519
- Level one?
- Sure.

192
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,271
We have levels one to three.

193
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:38,068
This is just wrong, damn it.

194
00:13:40,362 --> 00:13:42,531
Woo-hyeol, how does this make sense

195
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:45,075
when a real vampire is right here?

196
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,577
Vampire Tteokbokki opened right next door.

197
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:49,955
Hold on. What are you upset about?

198
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:52,541
Are you upset that they opened
Vampire Tteokbokki

199
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:54,084
when you're the real vampire

200
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,711
or that they opened a snack shop
in the same building as yours?

201
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:00,632
Both!

202
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:03,969
To win over youngsters these days,
you need a good concept.

203
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:06,221
Vampire Tteokbokki.

204
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:07,806
How cool is that?

205
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:11,476
Meanwhile, there's Dong-seop Snack Shop.

206
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:13,144
It's so tacky.

207
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:15,146
You put zero thought into the name.

208
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,190
But you said snack shops
were meant to be tacky

209
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:18,817
and it would help me blend in.

210
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:20,527
You thought it was nostalgic.

211
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,531
Don't you know there's a fine line
between retro and tacky?

212
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:28,201
I meant retro, but you made it tacky.

213
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:29,202
What, you punk?

214
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:35,500
Guys, that's enough.

215
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:38,795
What's the use of arguing among us?

216
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:43,216
When a franchise bakery opened
a few months ago,

217
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,760
all the local bakeries shut down.

218
00:14:46,595 --> 00:14:47,554
I guess it's my turn.

219
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:50,515
If you wanted to make money,
you should've gone with a franchise too.

220
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:52,017
Think before you speak.

221
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,519
It costs money to open a franchise store.

222
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:56,855
Whose fault was it
that I lost all my money?!

223
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:58,773
Why you little...

224
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:00,734
Damn it.

225
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:03,111
- Why are you taking your anger out on me?
- Guys!

226
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:06,448
As if you have the time
to slack off like this.

227
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:09,284
The tteokbokki will stick to the pan.

228
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:12,454
Hello, sir.

229
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:14,873
I was actually about to call you.

230
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:16,374
- What for?
- I mean,

231
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:19,753
how can there be two tteokbokki shops
in one building?

232
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:22,130
How can small stores manage

233
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:24,299
against franchise stores like that?

234
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:26,092
Why are you asking me that

235
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:28,637
when it's your problem as the owner?

236
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,389
But sir, this is a violation
of business ethics.

237
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:33,433
Business ethics, my foot.

238
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:35,769
Don't you know the law of the jungle?

239
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:37,937
Only the strong survive.

240
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:40,899
If that bothers you,
try beating your competition.

241
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,234
If your tteokbokki is tastier,

242
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:45,695
people will come to your shop instead.

243
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:46,905
Am I wrong?

244
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:50,909
You can't cut corners in life.

245
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:53,453
You must work your ass off.

246
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:57,540
Also, would it kill you to get a haircut?

247
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,377
Just look at you.
It makes one lose their appetite.

248
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,878
No wonder business is slow!

249
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:04,673
And with a face like that?

250
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:06,174
Who'd eat your tteokbokki?

251
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:07,759
Get a haircut.

252
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:29,489
REFRESH REAL ESTATE CONSULTING

253
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:40,417
You must've been at job interviews.

254
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,964
Did they go well?

255
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,342
Not really. They didn't go as planned.

256
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:52,387
And now I've run out of options.

257
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:58,059
By the way, the office is really nice.

258
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:00,019
Really?

259
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:03,523
Actually, I asked to see you

260
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:07,318
to talk to you
as a potential business partner.

261
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:09,320
A business partner?

262
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:11,281
- Me?
- Yes.

263
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:16,244
Are you offering me a job here?

264
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:18,997
No.

265
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:23,001
What do you think about running a business
with the mansion you live in?

266
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:24,586
Business?

267
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:26,337
I know that sounds grand,

268
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:29,299
but it's nothing more
than renting out the vacant rooms.

269
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,676
Like a shared house or guest house.

270
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:33,636
I see.

271
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,430
The place is spacious enough,

272
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:39,934
and we could give it a unique concept
by renovating it a bit.

273
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:46,566
I'm not asking for an answer on the spot.

274
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,611
Just consider the idea
since it's a viable option.

275
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:51,404
Okay.

276
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:54,282
I don't give advice
to just anyone, you know.

277
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:56,326
I'm telling you because it's you.

278
00:17:57,619 --> 00:17:59,829
I want you to be happier than anyone.

279
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,166
You deserve it.

280
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:07,837
When my blood is apparently
full of poison?

281
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:09,756
- What?
- What?

282
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:11,966
Oh, it's nothing.

283
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:19,724
Wouldn't it be better for you
to have others around the house?

284
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:22,977
Right, of course.

285
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:26,606
If you're interested,
I'll help in any way I can.

286
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,735
My company's not so bad, you know.
We're good at what we do.

287
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:53,383
CREDIT CARD BILL 3 100 000 WON

288
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:54,926
PHONE BILL 64 390 WON
HEALTH INSURANCE 35 240 WON

289
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:56,386
JEUNGSAN MECHANICAL TECHNICAL HIGH SCHOOL

290
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:57,470
WE REGRET TO INFORM YOU

291
00:18:57,554 --> 00:18:59,430
THAT YOUR APPLICATION
HAS NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL

292
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:12,694
A guest house?

293
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:16,197
What's that?

294
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:18,324
To put it simply,

295
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:20,869
we'll be renting out our spare rooms.

296
00:19:20,952 --> 00:19:22,078
I see.

297
00:19:22,871 --> 00:19:26,457
It must be the modern-day version
of a tavern or inn.

298
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,543
A guest house. GH for short.

299
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:32,422
- Never in a million years.
- Why not?

300
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:33,464
It's a no.

301
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:35,675
Why are you against it?

302
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:39,470
We have spare rooms anyway.

303
00:19:39,554 --> 00:19:43,558
Don't you think it's inefficient
to have this big house all to ourselves?

304
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:46,603
How else will you pay me back my money?

305
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:51,274
I told you I was waiting for someone.

306
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:54,736
I'm not suggesting we sell the house.

307
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:57,488
A hot spot.

308
00:19:57,739 --> 00:20:00,074
Let's turn it into a hot spot
like Shaded Oasis once was.

309
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:04,078
We can call it Shaded Oasis Guest House.

310
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:07,123
You said you once ran a popular joint.
Give that another try.

311
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:10,418
I said no.

312
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,171
Who knows?

313
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:14,422
If the place takes off,

314
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:17,133
there's a higher chance
that Hae-sun will come here.

315
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:32,899
Hae-sun...

316
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,361
Hae-sun...

317
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:38,947
might come?

318
00:20:39,614 --> 00:20:40,865
That's a possibility.

319
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:45,328
Do-sik is a prominent figure
in this line of work,

320
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:47,080
and he's willing to help.

321
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:49,374
- Why would he help?
- What?

322
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:51,376
Well...

323
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,711
Because we're college friends?

324
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:58,466
Anyway, I'm not fond
of receiving help from others,

325
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:00,426
but I'm in no place to decline.

326
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:03,179
I have my credit card bill
and inheritance tax to pay next month,

327
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,472
and I'm out of options.

328
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:07,016
This house can be seized
if I fail to pay the tax in time.

329
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:09,686
Seized?

330
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:12,563
- That can't happen.
- Exactly.

331
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:14,732
So do as I say if you don't want that.

332
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:16,734
As of right now, this is our best option.

333
00:21:23,366 --> 00:21:25,910
DAEBAK BUTCHER SHOP

334
00:21:25,994 --> 00:21:26,995
Are you heading home?

335
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:28,788
Yes.

336
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:29,706
Goodness.

337
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:31,791
Staying late doesn't guarantee customers.

338
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,419
I'm better off saving money
on electricity.

339
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:38,715
All that sells is ox blood,
which makes no money.

340
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:42,260
Still, you're lucky to have
Mr. Ox Blood as a customer.

341
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:43,803
Lucky, my ass.

342
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:45,263
Watch your language, will you?

343
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:49,976
By the way, when is the upcoming
neighborhood patrol?

344
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:53,479
I believe it's this week. Why?

345
00:21:53,563 --> 00:21:55,481
- Really? Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

346
00:21:55,565 --> 00:21:57,442
I should teach them a lesson

347
00:21:57,525 --> 00:22:00,528
that living in this neighborhood
won't be all that great.

348
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:05,074
Let's go.

349
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:09,120
The guy is quite famous.

350
00:22:16,419 --> 00:22:17,879
He's so handsome.

351
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:20,131
Can't you introduce him to me?

352
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:21,382
Why? So you can feed on him?

353
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:23,509
Don't be ridiculous.

354
00:22:23,718 --> 00:22:25,720
"Every place he touches
turns into a hot spot."

355
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:28,639
"Man with the Midas touch, CEO Shin Do-sik
of Refresh Real Estate Consulting."

356
00:22:28,723 --> 00:22:30,224
- So this man
- Yes?

357
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:34,604
will help you transform the mansion
into a guest house?

358
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:36,439
- Yes.
- How nice of him.

359
00:22:37,648 --> 00:22:40,902
This isn't him being nice.
I think he likes her.

360
00:22:41,903 --> 00:22:44,322
Offering help
without wanting anything in return?

361
00:22:44,405 --> 00:22:45,615
That's a sign of love.

362
00:22:46,074 --> 00:22:48,034
The way I see it,

363
00:22:48,326 --> 00:22:49,869
I'm certain that Shin Do-sik likes her.

364
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:56,793
I'll get going then.

365
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:00,713
That's right.

366
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:04,759
Butler Joo also wasn't acting
like her usual self.

367
00:23:05,468 --> 00:23:06,469
Really?

368
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:08,846
They must like each other.

369
00:23:10,264 --> 00:23:12,141
Then I must get them together.

370
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:15,478
All will be well
if she falls in love with him.

371
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:19,440
They'll get together often
to discuss the guest house,

372
00:23:19,524 --> 00:23:21,359
so just be a good wingman.

373
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:48,678
Did they go well?

374
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,889
Not really. They didn't go as planned.

375
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:53,933
And now I've run out of options.

376
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:58,479
She rarely speaks of her hardships.

377
00:24:14,912 --> 00:24:16,664
4. CHECK THE SURROUNDING AREA!
AVOID ISOLATED AREAS!

378
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:18,499
5. STAY CLOSE TO OTHER GUEST HOUSES!

379
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:23,796
START A GUEST HOUSE
WITH THE HELP OF OUR TEAM!

380
00:24:29,886 --> 00:24:30,928
Do-sik,

381
00:24:31,554 --> 00:24:35,266
I thought about the proposition you made
regarding the guest house.

382
00:24:41,022 --> 00:24:45,026
Can we meet up and talk
when you have time?

383
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:54,869
DO-SIK

384
00:24:58,164 --> 00:24:59,290
Hey, Do-sik.

385
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:00,374
So tell me.

386
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:02,668
Have you thought about it?

387
00:25:04,212 --> 00:25:06,005
I hope I didn't call too soon.

388
00:25:06,756 --> 00:25:09,592
It's all right.
I was just about to contact you.

389
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:15,514
I'd like to take your advice
and open up a guest house.

390
00:25:16,474 --> 00:25:17,516
Really?

391
00:25:20,061 --> 00:25:20,937
I'm glad.

392
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:26,108
But I know nothing about this field.

393
00:25:26,734 --> 00:25:28,861
I've been doing some research myself,

394
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:33,241
but I'd appreciate it
if you could help me out.

395
00:25:33,324 --> 00:25:34,909
How can I not when you're asking?

396
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:36,869
I'll help to the best of my ability.

397
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,663
Thank you.

398
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,791
While we're at it,
why don't we meet up today?

399
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:43,626
Today?

400
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:47,964
Bring me all the data we have
on guest houses.

401
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:50,049
Sorry? Why all of a sudden--

402
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:51,008
No, wait.

403
00:25:51,092 --> 00:25:53,427
Let's put together a task force first.

404
00:25:53,803 --> 00:25:56,013
Get them ready for a guest house project.

405
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,517
- Mr. Shin--
- We don't have time.

406
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,811
The client will be here at 4 p.m.,
so hurry.

407
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:06,065
Get moving.

408
00:26:06,941 --> 00:26:08,401
Yes, sir.

409
00:26:22,123 --> 00:26:24,166
REFRESH REAL ESTATE CONSULTING

410
00:26:30,715 --> 00:26:32,258
Are you here to see Mr. Shin?

411
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:34,719
Oh, yes.

412
00:26:34,802 --> 00:26:35,678
Please follow me.

413
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:51,193
You're here.

414
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,697
Do-sik, what on earth is going on?

415
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,408
I thought of a concept
for your guest house.

416
00:26:57,742 --> 00:26:58,909
This is a bit much.

417
00:26:58,993 --> 00:27:00,911
- Don't feel burdened.
- But I do!

418
00:27:01,996 --> 00:27:02,913
Take a seat.

419
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:16,761
I will now begin the presentation
on the conception plan

420
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:18,346
for the guest house in Gongcheon-dong.

421
00:27:19,889 --> 00:27:21,766
While retaining
the hanok style and structure,

422
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:24,018
we transformed it
into a more modernized guest house

423
00:27:24,101 --> 00:27:26,896
with practical
and modern interior designs.

424
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:30,858
The unused space was turned into
a laundry and utility room

425
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:33,027
to accommodate the guests.

426
00:27:33,611 --> 00:27:35,780
The elegant features
of the century-year-old mansion

427
00:27:35,863 --> 00:27:37,156
will be kept intact while...

428
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:43,037
How was it today?

429
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:48,626
You came up with so many ideas
in such a short time.

430
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:50,378
I was surprised.

431
00:27:50,711 --> 00:27:52,838
When I offer my help, I go all out.

432
00:27:54,382 --> 00:27:57,093
Thanks to you,
I feel less burdened about all this.

433
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:58,052
Thank you.

434
00:27:58,135 --> 00:28:00,513
I need to check out the structure
and measure the space.

435
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:02,431
When can I visit?

436
00:28:02,765 --> 00:28:04,475
Oh, the house?

437
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:08,771
I'll discuss it when I get home
and let you know.

438
00:28:09,939 --> 00:28:11,357
Oh, of course.

439
00:28:14,068 --> 00:28:14,902
All right.

440
00:28:15,486 --> 00:28:16,404
Let me know.

441
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:17,655
Okay.

442
00:28:34,797 --> 00:28:36,841
Thank you so much for today.

443
00:28:37,133 --> 00:28:39,468
Sure. Call me if you have any questions.

444
00:28:39,677 --> 00:28:40,928
Okay, I will.

445
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:42,138
Head on inside then.

446
00:28:57,445 --> 00:28:59,905
Offering help
without wanting anything in return?

447
00:28:59,989 --> 00:29:01,198
That's a sign of love.

448
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:04,034
The way I see it,

449
00:29:04,118 --> 00:29:05,619
I'm certain that Shin Do-sik likes her.

450
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,164
Right.

451
00:29:09,373 --> 00:29:11,500
I can only become human
by drinking Butler Joo's blood

452
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:13,127
after she falls in love.

453
00:29:15,713 --> 00:29:17,214
Let's focus on that for now.

454
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:39,320
SEON WOO-HYEOL

455
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:45,284
- What is it?
- Come downstairs so we can talk.

456
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:46,577
What--

457
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:55,836
Why did you call me when you were home?

458
00:30:00,049 --> 00:30:01,717
I didn't want to risk it

459
00:30:02,051 --> 00:30:03,469
by knocking on your door.

460
00:30:05,888 --> 00:30:08,724
- What's up?
- I contemplated long and hard

461
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:12,645
about that guest house you mentioned.

462
00:30:13,896 --> 00:30:16,273
Go ahead with it.

463
00:30:17,191 --> 00:30:18,692
It's already in motion.

464
00:30:19,902 --> 00:30:21,946
- Already?
- Also, Do-sik wants to

465
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:23,656
visit the mansion someday.

466
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:24,823
When is convenient for you?

467
00:30:26,659 --> 00:30:27,785
Is this a situation

468
00:30:28,536 --> 00:30:32,164
where I should give you two some space?

469
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:33,374
What?

470
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:39,421
What are you getting at?
It's nothing like that!

471
00:30:39,505 --> 00:30:40,714
Why are you getting defensive?

472
00:30:41,382 --> 00:30:45,219
I was only worried
about my identity getting revealed.

473
00:30:45,803 --> 00:30:49,306
What inappropriate thought
is running through your head?

474
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,934
Forget it. You can stay home.

475
00:30:53,102 --> 00:30:54,270
My goodness.

476
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:57,898
Also, can you stop speaking in that way?

477
00:30:57,982 --> 00:30:59,358
I shall try my best.

478
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:02,778
What's with him?

479
00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:05,781
Whatever. Why do I even bother?

480
00:31:18,085 --> 00:31:21,714
Do-sik, you can come by the mansion
at your convenience.

481
00:31:22,298 --> 00:31:23,882
IN-HAE

482
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:32,099
Mr. Gu.

483
00:31:32,933 --> 00:31:33,976
Yes, Mr. Shin.

484
00:31:35,561 --> 00:31:38,939
Are we busy this Friday?

485
00:31:42,026 --> 00:31:43,694
You have a meeting
with a construction company

486
00:31:43,777 --> 00:31:45,654
and a site visit scheduled.

487
00:31:45,738 --> 00:31:46,739
If they're not urgent,

488
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:49,199
can we push them back to next week?

489
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:50,367
Sorry?

490
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:52,661
All of a sudden?

491
00:31:52,953 --> 00:31:54,872
Something urgent just came up.

492
00:31:54,955 --> 00:31:57,541
That urgent business that suddenly came up

493
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:00,169
must be related to the guest house.

494
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:01,587
I'm not sure.

495
00:32:05,633 --> 00:32:06,634
All right.

496
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:17,561
MS. NA HAE-WON

497
00:32:18,729 --> 00:32:19,730
Hello, Ms. Na.

498
00:32:27,071 --> 00:32:27,946
Sang-hae.

499
00:32:28,781 --> 00:32:30,032
I have a job for you.

500
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,576
- What is it?
- Shin Do-sik.

501
00:32:33,327 --> 00:32:34,745
Look into him for me.

502
00:32:34,828 --> 00:32:36,580
What exactly are you worried about?

503
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:39,625
Before I do anything,

504
00:32:40,209 --> 00:32:42,878
I want to make sure he is a decent fellow.

505
00:32:43,587 --> 00:32:46,006
Look into his love life, financials,

506
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:47,424
drinking habits,

507
00:32:47,508 --> 00:32:49,259
and anything else
you can find out about him.

508
00:32:49,635 --> 00:32:51,553
Are you looking out for her?

509
00:32:51,637 --> 00:32:53,347
Don't be ridiculous.

510
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:55,140
You're acting like a worried big brother.

511
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:56,850
That's not it.

512
00:32:59,812 --> 00:33:01,438
As if.

513
00:33:07,027 --> 00:33:08,153
Why would you park...

514
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:12,616
What are you doing?

515
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:13,742
Lee...

516
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:16,120
Lee Man-hwi.

517
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:18,914
I may look younger than you,

518
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,374
but I'm way older.

519
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:22,084
Show some respect.

520
00:33:23,252 --> 00:33:25,963
- What brings you here?
- I'd like to ask that myself.

521
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,967
What are you taking photos of
hiding like a rat?

522
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:32,636
"A rat"? What are you talking about?

523
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,514
I was just intrigued
by this hot spot, that's all.

524
00:33:45,315 --> 00:33:46,233
Sang-hae.

525
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:49,987
- Until when will you live like this?
- What do you mean?

526
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:52,781
We're forced to live for centuries,

527
00:33:53,282 --> 00:33:57,119
so when will you stop living like a loser?

528
00:33:58,871 --> 00:34:01,290
Woo-hyeol is back,
so things will probably get better.

529
00:34:05,753 --> 00:34:07,588
What did you just say?

530
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:09,506
Seon Woo-hyeol is back?

531
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:12,676
I'll tell him you said hi.

532
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,594
Goodbye then.

533
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:26,023
Ms. Na.

534
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:30,360
It's tough to see you these days.

535
00:34:31,028 --> 00:34:32,112
Sorry about that.

536
00:34:32,196 --> 00:34:33,906
I had urgent business to attend to.

537
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:37,284
The mansion in Gongcheon-dong I mentioned.

538
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:39,036
I was hoping to buy it.

539
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:40,496
Oh, that?

540
00:34:42,206 --> 00:34:45,125
The one who inherited the place
is a college friend.

541
00:34:45,334 --> 00:34:47,252
- Is that so?
- But I'm afraid

542
00:34:47,795 --> 00:34:51,256
purchasing the property isn't an option
due to her current situation.

543
00:34:51,757 --> 00:34:55,135
Instead, we've been discussing
utilizing it as a potential guest house.

544
00:34:55,552 --> 00:34:56,845
A guest house?

545
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:04,520
The noodle seasoning
does seem to add more flavor.

546
00:35:06,146 --> 00:35:08,023
This piquant smell

547
00:35:08,232 --> 00:35:09,358
that tickles my nostrils.

548
00:35:16,198 --> 00:35:17,032
Seop.

549
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:18,325
Yes?

550
00:35:18,742 --> 00:35:20,452
Until when must we live like this?

551
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:23,956
I thought Woo-hyeol's return
would turn things around,

552
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:26,041
but instead,
he only has me spy on someone.

553
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,292
What is it now?

554
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:31,255
Lee Man-hwi is as annoying as ever.

555
00:35:32,506 --> 00:35:33,549
You ran into him?

556
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:37,803
I don't know who he's mooching off now,
but he's dripping with luxury.

557
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:39,221
He even has his own car.

558
00:35:39,972 --> 00:35:41,014
Hey.

559
00:35:43,267 --> 00:35:46,311
He may not have his teeth
in someone's neck,

560
00:35:46,395 --> 00:35:48,438
but it's the same as sucking human blood.

561
00:35:48,522 --> 00:35:51,650
All he does is cause trouble
while mooching off someone rich.

562
00:35:52,943 --> 00:35:55,279
Don't let yourself be fazed by this.

563
00:35:55,362 --> 00:35:57,656
Nothing beats hard-earned money.

564
00:35:57,739 --> 00:35:59,741
What's the point of slaving away?

565
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:00,868
Unbelievable.

566
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,036
Could there be another way?

567
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,454
Like what?

568
00:36:04,538 --> 00:36:07,165
If only we had those gold bars.

569
00:36:07,249 --> 00:36:09,001
- Darn.
- Gold bars?

570
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:11,295
The ones we buried
under Woo-hyeol's coffin.

571
00:36:11,378 --> 00:36:13,463
Wait. Didn't you take them?

572
00:36:13,547 --> 00:36:14,882
It wasn't me!

573
00:36:14,965 --> 00:36:17,593
- I thought it was you!
- How many times must I tell you

574
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:19,970
that it wasn't me who took it?

575
00:36:20,721 --> 00:36:21,889
All right.

576
00:36:21,972 --> 00:36:25,517
I'm going to find those gold bars
just to clear my name.

577
00:36:26,602 --> 00:36:29,855
If we had those gold bars,
our lives would've turned out differently.

578
00:36:31,982 --> 00:36:34,192
Where did they go though?

579
00:36:34,276 --> 00:36:35,360
Should we look for them?

580
00:36:35,569 --> 00:36:39,072
Don't waste time on something useless

581
00:36:39,656 --> 00:36:41,158
and learn a skill or two.

582
00:36:41,241 --> 00:36:44,077
I hear excavator operators
earn quite a lot.

583
00:36:44,161 --> 00:36:46,955
I don't have a driver's license,
so why would you suggest that?

584
00:36:48,916 --> 00:36:50,626
It must be the landlady.

585
00:36:52,794 --> 00:36:55,839
- Goodness, hello. Come on out.
- Hello.

586
00:36:55,923 --> 00:36:58,008
What on earth is that smell?

587
00:36:58,091 --> 00:37:00,177
- Ventilate, will you?
- Okay.

588
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,220
And let some light in
from time to time as well.

589
00:37:02,304 --> 00:37:03,388
Okay.

590
00:37:03,472 --> 00:37:06,224
I was trying out a new recipe. I'm sorry.

591
00:37:06,475 --> 00:37:09,728
Anyway, I came by to say
I'm increasing the deposit next month.

592
00:37:09,811 --> 00:37:11,313
What? The deposit?

593
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:12,606
Why are you so surprised?

594
00:37:13,023 --> 00:37:15,233
This is the cheapest place around here.

595
00:37:15,317 --> 00:37:17,152
I guess, but...

596
00:37:17,486 --> 00:37:18,987
This is all too sudden.

597
00:37:19,655 --> 00:37:21,907
Ma'am, things are tight for us these days.

598
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,784
That's not any of my concerns.

599
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:25,994
Anyway, that's what I came to tell you.

600
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:31,500
What now?

601
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:34,252
What else can we do?
We have only one option.

602
00:37:34,461 --> 00:37:35,796
- What?
- Seop.

603
00:37:37,047 --> 00:37:38,465
Let's find those gold bars.

604
00:37:49,518 --> 00:37:50,686
I should just quit.

605
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:54,731
I've had enough.

606
00:38:07,244 --> 00:38:09,246
Is there a vampire in this day and age

607
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:11,832
who isn't aware of the consequences
of biting humans?

608
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:17,295
What the hell?

609
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:31,018
Damn it!

610
00:38:33,979 --> 00:38:35,272
Who the hell are you, old man?

611
00:38:50,412 --> 00:38:51,747
Lead a good life.

612
00:38:52,456 --> 00:38:54,875
When times change,

613
00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:57,335
so should you.

614
00:38:59,004 --> 00:39:00,297
Heed my warning.

615
00:39:28,158 --> 00:39:29,201
What the hell?

616
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:03,318
Are you all right?

617
00:40:04,361 --> 00:40:06,780
Yes, I'm fine.

618
00:40:12,869 --> 00:40:14,871
All you had to do was ask for help.

619
00:40:14,955 --> 00:40:16,289
Why do you always do things alone?

620
00:40:16,373 --> 00:40:18,250
I'm not used to doing that.

621
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:21,378
When you live alone for so long,
you forget how to ask for help.

622
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:25,090
Yet asking for help on the guest house
came easily.

623
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,095
It wasn't just to benefit me.

624
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:32,430
Then what?

625
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:42,774
You're waiting for someone here.

626
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:45,485
What if we end up losing the house

627
00:40:45,569 --> 00:40:47,487
because we can't pay the tax?

628
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:49,573
If you're to meet that woman again,

629
00:40:49,656 --> 00:40:52,033
this house needs to stay
in our possession.

630
00:40:52,826 --> 00:40:53,827
Am I wrong?

631
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:11,970
I knew it.

632
00:41:12,053 --> 00:41:12,929
What?

633
00:41:13,013 --> 00:41:13,930
Stunning.

634
00:41:23,732 --> 00:41:24,649
Your eyes...

635
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:34,409
I'm talking about
my reflection in your eyes.

636
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:35,702
What?

637
00:41:39,122 --> 00:41:40,248
In your eyes...

638
00:41:42,459 --> 00:41:43,418
What the...

639
00:41:48,757 --> 00:41:50,008
Hey, Do-sik.

640
00:41:52,427 --> 00:41:53,803
I just wanted to see my reflection.

641
00:41:58,558 --> 00:41:59,809
This evening?

642
00:42:00,477 --> 00:42:02,270
Yes, I'm free.

643
00:42:02,354 --> 00:42:04,814
There's someone I'd like you to meet.

644
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:06,316
We'll talk over dinner.

645
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:07,859
I'll text you the address.

646
00:42:08,485 --> 00:42:10,153
Oh, okay.

647
00:42:10,237 --> 00:42:11,488
I'll see you later then.

648
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:30,715
Hello.

649
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:35,262
There should be a reservation
under the name Shin Do-sok.

650
00:42:35,345 --> 00:42:36,263
Just a moment please.

651
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:41,017
- Please follow me.
- Okay.

652
00:42:48,108 --> 00:42:49,150
In-hae.

653
00:42:49,234 --> 00:42:50,151
Hey, Do-sik.

654
00:42:51,027 --> 00:42:52,028
Have a seat.

655
00:42:54,447 --> 00:42:55,782
Hello.

656
00:42:56,533 --> 00:42:57,534
Hi.

657
00:42:58,076 --> 00:43:00,495
This is CEO Na Hae-won of Baderich.

658
00:43:00,745 --> 00:43:02,998
She runs a real estate investment company.

659
00:43:03,623 --> 00:43:05,333
This is Joo In-hae,
my friend from college.

660
00:43:05,417 --> 00:43:07,669
It's good to meet you, In-hae.
I've heard a lot about you.

661
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:09,504
I heard you're preparing
to open a guest house.

662
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:11,089
Yes, that's right.

663
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:13,466
I told her in advance.

664
00:43:16,052 --> 00:43:17,887
It seems tough,
but I'm willing to give it a try.

665
00:43:17,971 --> 00:43:20,473
I'm not sure how this will sound
considering we just met,

666
00:43:20,557 --> 00:43:23,143
but I was hoping
to invest in that guest house.

667
00:43:26,021 --> 00:43:28,356
You want to invest?

668
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:30,817
I don't know if Mr. Shin told you,

669
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,403
but I've been interested
in that mansion for a while.

670
00:43:33,653 --> 00:43:35,363
I see.

671
00:43:36,197 --> 00:43:40,076
But it was built over 100 years ago,
so it's pretty worn out.

672
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,536
That's what I like about it.

673
00:43:43,455 --> 00:43:44,706
I'm curious.

674
00:43:45,332 --> 00:43:49,169
For what reason has it managed
to stand firm all these years?

675
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:54,591
It's as if the mansion is talking to me.

676
00:43:58,011 --> 00:43:59,888
Did I sound like a lunatic just now?

677
00:44:03,308 --> 00:44:04,851
We'll discuss it more over our meal.

678
00:44:04,934 --> 00:44:05,852
Sure.

679
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:22,577
She seemed familiar.

680
00:44:26,331 --> 00:44:28,750
Hey, did you have a good time?

681
00:44:29,334 --> 00:44:30,418
What did Do-sik say?

682
00:44:30,627 --> 00:44:32,629
Since when did you call him
by his first name?

683
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:35,173
You barely even know him.

684
00:44:35,256 --> 00:44:37,592
Because you always do.

685
00:44:38,468 --> 00:44:40,637
"Do-sik."

686
00:44:41,096 --> 00:44:42,555
So it rubbed off on me too.

687
00:44:44,641 --> 00:44:45,600
So?

688
00:44:46,142 --> 00:44:48,395
We might receive an investment.

689
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:51,064
- An investment?
- Do-sik introduced me

690
00:44:51,147 --> 00:44:53,942
to a CEO of an investment company,

691
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:56,194
and she wants to invest in our guest house

692
00:44:56,277 --> 00:44:57,487
because she's fond of the place.

693
00:45:00,407 --> 00:45:02,492
She has good taste.

694
00:45:02,575 --> 00:45:04,828
She's also beautiful and rich.

695
00:45:05,286 --> 00:45:06,287
Is that so?

696
00:45:06,371 --> 00:45:09,874
She asked to see the mansion,
so I told her it could be arranged.

697
00:45:09,958 --> 00:45:11,584
She's our investor,

698
00:45:11,668 --> 00:45:14,712
so showing her around
is the least we can do, right?

699
00:45:16,047 --> 00:45:17,799
Then it's decided.

700
00:45:21,386 --> 00:45:22,429
So?

701
00:45:23,012 --> 00:45:25,306
What happened with Do-sik?

702
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:28,518
Here.

703
00:45:28,601 --> 00:45:32,772
Shin Do-sik is a workaholic
who spends most of his time at work.

704
00:45:33,148 --> 00:45:35,692
From the office to meetings,
and then back home. Day in, day out.

705
00:45:35,775 --> 00:45:37,694
Nothing was out of the ordinary. The end.

706
00:45:39,446 --> 00:45:41,114
Okay. Good job.

707
00:45:41,406 --> 00:45:42,323
By the way,

708
00:45:43,158 --> 00:45:45,452
do you know who I met while tailing him?

709
00:45:45,535 --> 00:45:46,995
- Who?
- Lee Man-hwi.

710
00:45:48,163 --> 00:45:50,290
He was startled to hear about your return.

711
00:45:50,623 --> 00:45:52,000
Is he doing well?

712
00:45:53,293 --> 00:45:54,878
I bet he's better off than any of us.

713
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:56,045
Rich and all.

714
00:45:56,713 --> 00:45:58,298
- Is that so?
- Which brings me to this.

715
00:45:58,798 --> 00:46:01,426
Seop and I are thinking of
looking for the gold bars.

716
00:46:02,051 --> 00:46:03,511
- The gold bars?
- Yes.

717
00:46:03,595 --> 00:46:05,221
You already took them.

718
00:46:05,305 --> 00:46:06,681
It wasn't me!

719
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:10,185
I already told you!
Why won't you believe me?

720
00:46:10,268 --> 00:46:13,021
I'm going to find them
just so that I can clear my name.

721
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:15,356
It really wasn't you?

722
00:46:17,317 --> 00:46:18,735
If I find it, we'll divide it equally.

723
00:46:19,027 --> 00:46:20,695
- Deal?
- What do you mean?

724
00:46:21,654 --> 00:46:22,739
We divide it three ways.

725
00:46:25,366 --> 00:46:26,409
In half.

726
00:46:51,643 --> 00:46:53,144
Do-sik, you're here early.

727
00:46:53,228 --> 00:46:55,271
I came straight from my previous schedule.

728
00:46:55,355 --> 00:46:56,856
- Come on in.
- May I?

729
00:47:04,614 --> 00:47:06,783
Wow, this is nice.

730
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:10,370
It's well-kept for a mansion this old.

731
00:47:12,789 --> 00:47:14,874
Hey, there. Welcome.

732
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:16,626
Hello.

733
00:47:16,709 --> 00:47:17,710
We meet again.

734
00:47:17,794 --> 00:47:18,920
We do.

735
00:47:19,003 --> 00:47:20,088
Pleasure to work with you.

736
00:47:20,463 --> 00:47:22,257
Pleasure's all mine.

737
00:47:23,258 --> 00:47:24,717
I'll give you a tour.

738
00:47:24,801 --> 00:47:25,802
- Follow me.
- Okay.

739
00:47:34,435 --> 00:47:35,728
We'll swap out this painting.

740
00:47:35,812 --> 00:47:39,482
And we should get new wallpapers
rather than painting over them.

741
00:47:39,566 --> 00:47:43,403
That sounds good.
The wallpaper extends to this hallway.

742
00:47:43,486 --> 00:47:45,947
Don't you think the chandelier's
hanging too low compared to your height?

743
00:47:47,365 --> 00:47:48,366
A bit.

744
00:47:49,075 --> 00:47:50,285
Has the place been cleaned?

745
00:47:50,368 --> 00:47:52,453
Yes, we cleaned it thoroughly.

746
00:47:52,537 --> 00:47:54,122
I bet it took days.

747
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:58,209
- Who knew she could giggle like that?
- No, but it took a whole day.

748
00:47:58,835 --> 00:48:00,253
So those are the rooms

749
00:48:00,336 --> 00:48:01,629
- on the second floor.
- Right.

750
00:48:01,713 --> 00:48:04,549
I thought that the rooms on this side
could be for single guests.

751
00:48:04,632 --> 00:48:06,593
- There are rooms that way that--
- Hold on.

752
00:48:19,188 --> 00:48:20,315
Thanks, Do-sik.

753
00:48:20,398 --> 00:48:22,191
- Would you like to check over here?
- Sure.

754
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:31,993
Let's see.

755
00:48:32,076 --> 00:48:33,411
There's a car.

756
00:48:36,164 --> 00:48:38,791
The place has been getting
a lot of visitors these days.

757
00:48:40,501 --> 00:48:42,420
Are there talks about redevelopment?

758
00:48:50,595 --> 00:48:52,513
The house is more spacious than I thought.

759
00:48:52,597 --> 00:48:54,307
- Is it?
- Yes.

760
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:56,643
There are more than enough rooms,

761
00:48:56,726 --> 00:48:59,437
so it'll be a great fit for a guest house
after some minor renovations.

762
00:49:00,021 --> 00:49:01,022
I'm glad to hear that.

763
00:49:04,025 --> 00:49:05,276
What's over there?

764
00:49:05,735 --> 00:49:06,736
Well...

765
00:49:06,819 --> 00:49:09,614
That's just the basement
we use for storage.

766
00:49:09,697 --> 00:49:10,907
Basement storage?

767
00:49:11,324 --> 00:49:12,450
Can I take a look?

768
00:49:12,533 --> 00:49:15,787
Actually, no.
I didn't get around to cleaning it.

769
00:49:17,038 --> 00:49:18,915
Did you enjoy your tour?

770
00:49:19,165 --> 00:49:20,124
I did.

771
00:49:21,084 --> 00:49:23,002
The structure's old,
but there's an elegance to it.

772
00:49:23,836 --> 00:49:26,255
You seem to have better taste
than I thought.

773
00:49:26,881 --> 00:49:27,715
Sorry?

774
00:49:28,591 --> 00:49:30,927
Woo-hyeol, don't you have things to do?

775
00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:32,095
I don't.

776
00:49:32,762 --> 00:49:33,680
In-hae.

777
00:49:34,138 --> 00:49:36,057
If it's okay, could I get a cup of tea?

778
00:49:37,308 --> 00:49:38,810
Oh, of course.

779
00:49:44,232 --> 00:49:45,608
Would you like to have a seat?

780
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:47,068
Sure.

781
00:49:57,870 --> 00:49:59,872
There's something
I've been wanting to ask.

782
00:50:00,123 --> 00:50:03,126
May I ask about
your relationship with In-hae?

783
00:50:04,711 --> 00:50:07,088
I heard your ancestors were acquainted,

784
00:50:07,296 --> 00:50:09,048
but what's the exact nature of it?

785
00:50:11,843 --> 00:50:13,386
Our ancestors did know each other.

786
00:50:14,262 --> 00:50:15,221
And that's all.

787
00:50:16,514 --> 00:50:17,765
If it's not too much to ask,

788
00:50:18,099 --> 00:50:20,560
may I ask you to spell it out for me?

789
00:50:22,145 --> 00:50:25,022
Are you that curious?

790
00:50:25,231 --> 00:50:26,691
- I am.
- Why?

791
00:50:27,442 --> 00:50:30,862
How can I not be curious when
a man and a woman are living together?

792
00:50:31,112 --> 00:50:32,780
The fact that I'm living with her

793
00:50:34,323 --> 00:50:35,950
must really bother you.

794
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:37,410
I'd be lying if I said it didn't.

795
00:50:44,542 --> 00:50:46,294
I also have something to ask.

796
00:50:47,211 --> 00:50:48,921
Butler Joo, I mean...

797
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:52,925
What do you think of In-hae?

798
00:50:53,259 --> 00:50:54,218
In-hae?

799
00:50:55,845 --> 00:50:56,929
Well...

800
00:50:58,306 --> 00:50:59,682
I think of her as a good friend.

801
00:50:59,766 --> 00:51:00,933
Is that all?

802
00:51:01,392 --> 00:51:02,977
What answer are you looking for?

803
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,437
A manlier one.

804
00:51:05,104 --> 00:51:06,189
A manlier answer?

805
00:51:06,272 --> 00:51:09,108
One that is more certain and reliable.

806
00:51:09,192 --> 00:51:10,443
You know what I mean.

807
00:51:11,736 --> 00:51:12,820
In that case,

808
00:51:15,948 --> 00:51:17,700
she's the woman I wish to protect.

809
00:51:18,493 --> 00:51:19,952
How's that for an answer?

810
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:38,054
Here you go.

811
00:51:38,554 --> 00:51:39,472
Thanks.

812
00:51:45,728 --> 00:51:46,729
It has a nice aroma.

813
00:51:47,438 --> 00:51:48,689
It's jasmine tea.

814
00:52:03,704 --> 00:52:05,164
Thank you for today, Do-sik.

815
00:52:05,248 --> 00:52:06,749
It was my pleasure.

816
00:52:10,002 --> 00:52:11,003
See you next time.

817
00:52:12,964 --> 00:52:14,048
Have a safe trip back.

818
00:52:16,175 --> 00:52:18,052
- I'll get going.
- Okay. Get home safe.

819
00:52:29,939 --> 00:52:31,649
What did you talk about while I was gone?

820
00:52:32,024 --> 00:52:33,568
It better not have been anything weird.

821
00:52:35,570 --> 00:52:38,281
You must be happy to have
so many people who protect you.

822
00:52:39,657 --> 00:52:40,616
What?

823
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:47,415
Do you know what he said?

824
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:53,170
"She's the woman I wish to protect."

825
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:57,008
"How's that for an answer?"

826
00:52:57,717 --> 00:52:58,718
That's what he said.

827
00:53:00,094 --> 00:53:01,220
How manly of him.

828
00:53:05,057 --> 00:53:06,517
What's with your face though?

829
00:53:07,852 --> 00:53:09,270
What? Why?

830
00:53:09,812 --> 00:53:11,105
What about my face?

831
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:12,231
You seem angry.

832
00:53:14,442 --> 00:53:15,484
I'm not.

833
00:53:16,527 --> 00:53:17,486
Woo-hyeol.

834
00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:19,822
Don't worry. It's pretty much done.

835
00:53:19,906 --> 00:53:21,741
You don't even have to play matchmaker.

836
00:53:21,824 --> 00:53:23,576
All you have to do is wait.

837
00:53:23,659 --> 00:53:24,660
Congratulations.

838
00:53:38,966 --> 00:53:39,967
Yes?

839
00:53:47,516 --> 00:53:48,684
You scared me.

840
00:53:49,101 --> 00:53:50,061
What...

841
00:53:51,729 --> 00:53:53,940
What the...

842
00:53:55,816 --> 00:53:58,653
What are you doing here at this hour?

843
00:53:58,861 --> 00:54:01,405
Didn't you get the notice?

844
00:54:02,114 --> 00:54:03,199
What notice?

845
00:54:03,282 --> 00:54:06,285
We're supposed to go
on neighborhood security patrol today.

846
00:54:07,036 --> 00:54:08,788
Security patrol?

847
00:54:10,289 --> 00:54:11,332
Is that a thing?

848
00:54:11,415 --> 00:54:12,625
- Of course.
- Absolutely.

849
00:54:15,294 --> 00:54:17,546
As long as you live in this neighborhood,

850
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:19,632
you must patrol the area
on designated days.

851
00:54:19,715 --> 00:54:21,008
- Right?
- Of course.

852
00:54:21,092 --> 00:54:22,301
The alleys are secluded,

853
00:54:22,385 --> 00:54:24,971
and the police substation isn't nearby,
so our neighborhood...

854
00:54:25,054 --> 00:54:26,889
- It is ours to protect.
- Exactly.

855
00:54:27,348 --> 00:54:29,058
Right, I see.

856
00:54:30,977 --> 00:54:33,688
But that doesn't mean

857
00:54:33,938 --> 00:54:37,358
you can come by my house unannounced
at this hour.

858
00:54:37,775 --> 00:54:39,318
- My gosh!
- You startled me!

859
00:54:40,236 --> 00:54:41,362
What is this about?

860
00:54:41,696 --> 00:54:42,863
You startled us.

861
00:54:50,413 --> 00:54:53,082
What brings you to our house?

862
00:54:53,332 --> 00:54:55,835
Mr. Ox Blood, I'm glad you're here.

863
00:54:56,127 --> 00:54:57,753
Get ready for tonight's patrol.

864
00:54:59,088 --> 00:55:00,256
Here you go.

865
00:55:03,634 --> 00:55:04,635
You heard them.

866
00:55:06,554 --> 00:55:09,974
You will patrol your areas
in groups of two

867
00:55:10,057 --> 00:55:12,268
- and meet back here.
- Got it.

868
00:55:12,351 --> 00:55:14,770
- You know your areas, right?
- Yes.

869
00:55:14,854 --> 00:55:15,896
Good luck then.

870
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:17,481
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

871
00:55:24,905 --> 00:55:25,906
Over there.

872
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:28,117
- Over there?
- Right.

873
00:55:28,367 --> 00:55:29,744
Turn that on first.

874
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:32,204
Shall we?

875
00:55:38,544 --> 00:55:39,754
Don't you think

876
00:55:40,296 --> 00:55:43,841
we should cut those youngsters some slack?

877
00:55:44,425 --> 00:55:46,135
They're still our neighbors.

878
00:55:46,761 --> 00:55:48,054
Think of the real estate prices.

879
00:55:48,137 --> 00:55:49,889
Right, the real estate prices.

880
00:55:50,264 --> 00:55:52,391
Let's see how long they hold out.

881
00:55:52,808 --> 00:55:54,310
- Come on.
- Let's go.

882
00:55:58,814 --> 00:56:01,108
I haven't patrolled a neighborhood before.

883
00:56:02,610 --> 00:56:04,612
I've done it countless times.

884
00:56:05,613 --> 00:56:06,739
Neighborhood patrol?

885
00:56:08,908 --> 00:56:11,869
I guess you can say
I protected humans every night.

886
00:56:12,703 --> 00:56:16,791
I checked every night to see if any humans
were attacked by vampires.

887
00:56:18,042 --> 00:56:19,460
You did?

888
00:56:20,086 --> 00:56:21,629
Why? Is it hard to believe?

889
00:56:24,048 --> 00:56:25,925
It wasn't for the humans though.

890
00:56:26,592 --> 00:56:28,302
It was for our sake.

891
00:56:29,178 --> 00:56:30,596
I didn't want to be hunted again.

892
00:56:32,223 --> 00:56:33,224
Hunted?

893
00:56:35,684 --> 00:56:38,521
There were humans
who were after vampire blood.

894
00:56:39,688 --> 00:56:40,898
Vampire blood?

895
00:56:41,482 --> 00:56:44,068
Hae-sun died in the hands
of those hunters for me.

896
00:56:45,778 --> 00:56:48,447
And I've been waiting
for her ever since...

897
00:56:50,574 --> 00:56:52,785
without being able to turn human
because of someone.

898
00:56:55,246 --> 00:56:56,372
Talk about holding grudges.

899
00:57:19,311 --> 00:57:20,396
Earlier,

900
00:57:21,230 --> 00:57:22,773
when Do-sik came by,

901
00:57:24,483 --> 00:57:26,569
you didn't seem all that happy.

902
00:57:29,113 --> 00:57:30,114
Me?

903
00:57:31,782 --> 00:57:33,993
I thought about it,

904
00:57:34,493 --> 00:57:36,704
and I could understand why.

905
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:41,584
You kept the house intact for centuries,

906
00:57:42,334 --> 00:57:46,005
but I swooped in
wanting to fix it here and there.

907
00:57:47,173 --> 00:57:48,757
I felt bad.

908
00:57:50,843 --> 00:57:54,346
A hundred years ago
must seem like yesterday to you,

909
00:57:55,598 --> 00:57:59,435
so if everything disappears overnight,
you'd feel empty.

910
00:58:03,689 --> 00:58:05,065
I'm sorry.

911
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:08,986
I didn't think that far
into how you'd feel.

912
00:58:22,791 --> 00:58:23,834
You had dust in your hair.

913
00:58:27,213 --> 00:58:28,047
Right.

914
00:58:29,465 --> 00:58:30,591
Thank you.

915
00:58:43,145 --> 00:58:45,064
I guess patrolling isn't so bad.

916
00:58:45,356 --> 00:58:47,274
It wasn't.

917
00:58:54,114 --> 00:58:55,574
Ms. Na?

918
00:59:08,837 --> 00:59:11,257
What brings you by at this hour?

919
00:59:11,715 --> 00:59:14,593
I was nearby, so I thought I'd stop by.

920
00:59:14,843 --> 00:59:18,430
I see. Why don't you come in for some tea?

921
00:59:32,111 --> 00:59:33,112
Hae-sun.

922
01:00:00,556 --> 01:00:03,225
THANKS TO PARK IN-HWAN
FOR HIS SPECIAL APPEARANCE

923
01:00:14,862 --> 01:00:17,865
HEARTBEAT

924
01:00:19,116 --> 01:00:20,868
Are you suspecting Butler Joo right now?

925
01:00:20,951 --> 01:00:22,036
Gold Bar Search Party!

926
01:00:22,661 --> 01:00:25,080
Would there be any clues left
after all this time?

927
01:00:26,832 --> 01:00:28,417
Just focus on becoming human.

928
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:31,170
Be a man and push forward!

929
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:33,422
It's Hae-won, not Hae-sun.

930
01:00:33,505 --> 01:00:34,340
Na Hae-won.

931
01:00:34,423 --> 01:00:38,260
Don't think of her as the Hae-sun
who only lives in your memories.

932
01:00:38,344 --> 01:00:40,220
Think of her as the Hae-won she is now.

933
01:00:40,304 --> 01:00:41,889
Mr. Seon, why aren't you eating anything?

934
01:00:41,972 --> 01:00:45,017
- Be careful not to...
- "...expose myself as a vampire."

935
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:46,810
So this is what shrimp tastes like?

936
01:00:46,894 --> 01:00:48,312
The world may flip upside down,

937
01:00:48,395 --> 01:00:51,357
but those who are meant to be
will end up together.

938
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:53,650
Nobody remembers their past lives.

939
01:00:56,904 --> 01:00:58,906
