HEARTBEAT

00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,298
ALL CHARACTERS, NAMES,
ORGANIZATIONS, GROUPS, EVENTS,

3
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,383
AND SETTINGS ARE FICTITIOUS
AND ANIMAL SAFETY GUIDELINES WERE FOLLOWED

4
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:40,619
I'll go talk to her.

5
00:02:40,703 --> 00:02:41,537
Okay.

6
00:02:51,255 --> 00:02:52,548
Ms. Na, wait!

7
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:58,262
Do you have something to tell me?

8
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:00,097
I think there's a misunderstanding--

9
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,265
What misunderstanding?

10
00:03:01,724 --> 00:03:04,268
Actions speak louder than words.

11
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,522
Do I look stupid to you?

12
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:09,857
Everyone in there

13
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,068
probably thought the same thing.

14
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:15,654
The look in your eyes and your expressions

15
00:03:16,614 --> 00:03:18,157
aren't something you can fake.

16
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:23,120
You have feelings for Mr. Seon, don't you?

17
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:28,500
Thank you for your answer.

18
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:33,923
You got the wrong idea. Please listen...

19
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:37,885
Do you think you're somebody
because you're now

20
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:39,470
running this lousy business?

21
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:42,765
You messed with something
you shouldn't have.

22
00:03:43,766 --> 00:03:46,602
Let me teach you your place
once and for all.

23
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:50,898
I don't think she deserves
to hear that from you.

24
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:53,359
Please apologize.

25
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:54,276
Apologize?

26
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,403
She's the one who should apologize.

27
00:04:01,367 --> 00:04:04,286
It must feel great to have
so many men protecting you.

28
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:06,288
You've crossed the line.

29
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:15,214
Ms. Na.

30
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:17,091
Ms. Na!

31
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:19,677
Why are you acting like this?

32
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,637
We're in the middle of a party.

33
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:24,473
I should be the one saying that.
How could you do this to me?

34
00:04:25,391 --> 00:04:27,309
What about everything you said to me?

35
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:30,521
You asked me to wait just a little longer.

36
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:32,773
You said you'd keep your promise
no matter what.

37
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:36,193
I'm leaving.

38
00:04:36,527 --> 00:04:37,987
I'm not fit to be a third wheel.

39
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:50,791
Let's end the party here.

40
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:53,669
I'm sorry, Do-sik.

41
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:54,670
It's okay.

42
00:04:55,838 --> 00:04:57,923
Not everything in life
goes according to plan.

43
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:00,801
You should go in and wrap things up.

44
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,221
Okay.

45
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:21,071
Can we have a word?

46
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:29,872
What's your intention?

47
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:31,874
What do you mean?

48
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:34,710
You put In-hae in a tough spot
by acting rashly.

49
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:36,336
I didn't.

50
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,505
I got her out of a tough spot.

51
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:41,091
What?

52
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:43,093
Everyone was calling for her,

53
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:44,887
so I couldn't leave her standing there.

54
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:45,846
Also,

55
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,141
I don't understand
why I should be criticized

56
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:51,018
for dancing with a woman at a party.

57
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:52,269
In fact, I'm baffled.

58
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:53,979
Look what happened as a result of that.

59
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:56,982
You know why Ms. Na came to the party.

60
00:05:58,067 --> 00:06:00,069
You're the one who ruined this party.

61
00:06:01,487 --> 00:06:03,530
You said you'd leave
once you get what you want.

62
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:05,199
Is this what you want?

63
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,702
Don't sway In-hae

64
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:10,913
and leave quickly.

65
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:13,123
This is your last warning.

EPISODE 11

67
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,911
How dare he play with me?

68
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:00,504
Oh, come on!

69
00:07:00,838 --> 00:07:03,340
I didn't even get a sip!

70
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:05,300
- Do you have more?
- Darn it.

71
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:07,928
My blood pressure is dropping

72
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,555
after DJing all day.

73
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,390
Am I your blood bank or what?

74
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:12,808
I don't have any either!

75
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:20,607
It was the first party
at Shaded Oasis in 100 years.

76
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:23,193
What a bummer to end it so abruptly.

77
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:25,154
The party certainly brought back memories.

78
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:26,196
I had a great time.

79
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,614
Same here.

80
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:29,158
Oh, right.

81
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:32,619
Woo-hyeol had an intense look
in his eyes while he was dancing earlier.

82
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:33,871
Didn't you guys notice it?

83
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:36,039
I did think he was an attention seeker.

84
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:38,167
"Everyone, look how cool I am."

85
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,585
"I'm Seon Woo-hyeol."

86
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:42,087
No, that's not what I meant.

87
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:45,674
He had this peculiar look in his eyes.

88
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:47,301
Something's up for sure.

89
00:07:48,594 --> 00:07:52,514
Right, Ms. Na had
a pretty intense look in her eyes too.

90
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:55,642
She's the one who looks like Hae-sun
from the past, right?

91
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:57,102
I think so.

92
00:07:57,186 --> 00:07:58,145
Really?

93
00:07:58,228 --> 00:07:59,563
She's the one?

94
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:00,856
Woo-hyeol's first love?

95
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,526
She was so charismatic.

96
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:06,987
Even Woo-hyeol's first love
is extraordinary.

97
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,740
She's not the typical
pure and innocent type.

98
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,117
She knocked over all the glass
and everything.

99
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,536
Damn, she's so cool.

100
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,789
She seemed quite scary.

101
00:08:17,873 --> 00:08:19,625
Honestly, I got a little scared.

102
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,293
I understand why she did that though.

103
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:24,880
Woo-hyeol was dancing passionately
with another woman right before her eyes.

104
00:08:35,641 --> 00:08:36,850
You should go home.

105
00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:38,518
Thank you for helping us clean up.

106
00:08:38,602 --> 00:08:39,937
Of course we should.

107
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:42,022
Thank you all for your help today.

108
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:45,901
This isn't much,
but I wanted to express my gratitude.

109
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:49,655
- You didn't have to.
- Thank you.

110
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:51,073
Thank you so much.

111
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,783
Get home safely.

112
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:55,202
Please let us know if you need help.

113
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:57,079
We're always available.

114
00:08:57,579 --> 00:08:59,581
I'd also like to express my gratitude.

115
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:02,084
Goodness.

116
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:04,544
We'll get going then.

117
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:06,421
- All right.
- Darn you.

118
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:07,422
We'll get going.

119
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:15,430
Butler Joo.

120
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:21,186
Good work today.

121
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:24,147
You too.

122
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:43,375
Butler Joo.

123
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:49,506
I apologize

124
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,467
- if I put you in a tough spot.
- I think

125
00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:55,595
you should apologize to Ms. Na, not me.

126
00:09:57,055 --> 00:10:01,268
She had every reason to feel upset.

127
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:04,062
She was looking forward to the party
more than anyone.

128
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:08,650
To be honest,

129
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:12,237
she asked me to help her

130
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:14,239
express her feelings to you.

131
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:17,326
But things turned out this way.

132
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,329
That's not your fault.

133
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,541
I'm the one who dragged you
onto the dance floor.

134
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:27,169
I know you were only trying to help

135
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:29,129
because I was standing there awkwardly.

136
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:32,966
But it might've
come across differently to Ms. Na.

137
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:37,596
The one you should worry about
isn't me, but Ms. Na.

138
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:38,930
I mean,

139
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,224
Hae-sun.

140
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:44,478
Right.

141
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:47,606
But strangely enough,

142
00:10:49,358 --> 00:10:50,942
I was only worried about you.

143
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:58,492
I'm not sure what it is,

144
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:02,329
but I've never felt this way before.

145
00:11:03,914 --> 00:11:05,540
I now know what it feels like

146
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:07,667
to dance while looking
into the other person's eyes.

147
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:11,004
Even though I've lived so long,

148
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,006
I've never felt this way before.

149
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,594
I understand what you're trying to say.

150
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:21,348
I apologize for putting you
in an awkward position.

151
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:23,850
I will sort it out with Ms. Na,

152
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:25,435
so do not worry.

153
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:32,192
I'll go upstairs then.

154
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:33,985
Rest up.

155
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:54,297
The look in your eyes and your expressions
aren't something you can fake.

156
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:57,300
You have feelings for Mr. Seon, don't you?

157
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:04,599
Why did I not answer her?

158
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:09,813
I should've denied it immediately
instead of just standing there.

159
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:14,443
This is driving me nuts.

160
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:38,300
What on earth are you thinking?

161
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:40,886
Do you think this is
the time to dance around?

162
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:43,430
I told you there isn't much time
and you must hurry!

163
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:46,808
You saw everything?

164
00:12:46,892 --> 00:12:50,103
You may not be aware,
but I'm always watching you.

165
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:54,774
I'm not sure
why I'm behaving like this either.

166
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,737
She's constantly on my mind.

167
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:04,242
It's funny because all I need from her
is her blood that is full of love.

168
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:07,871
I just want her to be happy.

169
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,248
That's how I feel.

170
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:17,547
Did you forget
why you wanted to become human?

171
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:21,259
Mr. Ko.

172
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:29,434
I made a promise.

173
00:13:30,185 --> 00:13:31,603
That we would meet again

174
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:35,440
and love each other with all our hearts.

175
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:38,944
I haven't forgotten.

176
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:45,742
Why do you think I told you the secret
to becoming human?

177
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:47,244
Didn't you tell me last time?

178
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:51,331
You said my desperation moved you.

179
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:55,627
And I shared your desperation.

180
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:04,177
An arrow with a silver arrowhead

181
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:07,055
and a shaft made of hawthorn wood.

182
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:10,350
Little did I know

183
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:13,395
that the arrow I inadvertently mentioned

184
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,730
would pierce countless vampires' hearts.

185
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:25,991
And that some would lose their loved ones
as a result of that...

186
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:27,826
No!

187
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:30,870
...and end up longing for them
for the rest of their lives.

188
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:34,749
If I had known all this,

189
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,711
I would never have made such a decision.

190
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:41,506
Are you saying you're the reason

191
00:14:42,591 --> 00:14:43,925
Hae-sun died?

192
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:46,428
That's why I wanted to help you

193
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:49,097
by any means possible.

194
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:51,725
So please become human

195
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:53,435
and live a happy life.

196
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:57,022
When I finally see you experience
love that makes your heart beat,

197
00:14:57,314 --> 00:14:59,941
I'll finally be able to ease my guilt
to some extent.

198
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:03,236
Guilt?

199
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:08,325
Are you saying

200
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:11,202
you told me the secret to becoming human

201
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:14,748
and have watched me all this time

202
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:17,792
because of your guilt?

203
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:20,378
I'm sorry.

204
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:53,495
I'm certain that Seon Woo-hyeol's friends
are also vampires.

205
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:00,710
What's this?

206
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:04,756
I'm afraid it's going to take more time

207
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:08,176
to find a half-vampire
with a scar on their body.

208
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:11,388
It's important to check for a scar,

209
00:16:12,097 --> 00:16:15,934
but a half-vampire must be
different from a vampire in some way.

210
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:19,521
A half-vampire is supposed to be
more human-like than an ordinary vampire.

211
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:21,773
It seems like blood packs

212
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:24,526
are being distributed illegally
within the vampire community.

213
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:27,404
I will get in touch with other vampires
through that route.

214
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:28,363
Okay.

215
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:31,116
Even vampires must need money to survive.

216
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:36,079
It might be a good idea
to hire a vampire who can give us intel.

217
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:37,414
Yes, sir.

218
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:40,667
You talked to Ms. Na beforehand, right?

219
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,211
Yes, she's waiting for you
in her penthouse.

220
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:06,025
You seem to be very patient.

221
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:08,319
Am I the only one

222
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:10,989
who sensed something unusual
from their dance yesterday?

223
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,658
Are you not bothered at all?

224
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:16,286
I thought you'd thank me.

225
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:17,954
It's not that I'm being patient.

226
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:19,956
I'm being polite.

227
00:17:20,582 --> 00:17:22,167
I'm showing respect for the person I like.

228
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,962
It's disrespectful to act on emotions.

229
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,632
In that sense, your behavior yesterday

230
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:32,093
was rather immature.

231
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:33,887
Are you taking Ms. Joo's side?

232
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,889
Yes, I am.

233
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:38,266
The world has changed.

234
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,226
There are many eyes on you.

235
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:42,312
So please show some respect.

236
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:44,189
Is that what you're here to tell me?

237
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:51,029
I don't think
anyone can say this to you except for me.

238
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:02,123
Hey.

239
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:10,715
You can go first.

240
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:16,971
By the way,

241
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:19,557
why is your face so red?

242
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:25,480
Because it's hot.

243
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:28,399
I don't think it's that hot.

244
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,112
You guys were on fire
on the dance floor last night.

245
00:18:33,905 --> 00:18:34,989
I smell something.

246
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:36,366
I smell love in the air.

247
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:37,909
It's not like that.

248
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:39,077
I don't smell anything.

249
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:41,996
She smells what in the air?

250
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,125
In-hae,

251
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:48,002
can we talk in my office?

252
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:49,546
It's something important.

253
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:52,590
Do-sik wants to talk in his office.

254
00:18:52,674 --> 00:18:54,425
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

255
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:07,272
Respect for the person you like?

256
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,315
Wake up, Mr. Shin.

257
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:12,610
You'll have her taken away

258
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:14,487
while holding on to your decency.

259
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:20,660
Hey.

260
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:21,661
You're here.

261
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:24,372
I haven't been here in a while.

262
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:26,499
Should we go for lunch?

263
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,878
Sorry, but I have to go back soon.
Woo-hyeol is alone.

264
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:38,428
I met Ms. Na this morning.

265
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:42,432
It seems like she got the wrong idea
about your relationship with Mr. Seon.

266
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:45,685
I explained things to her.

267
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:49,606
But to be honest, I was curious too.

268
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:51,983
About what?

269
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:53,902
By any chance,

270
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,489
are the two of you
interested in each other?

271
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,574
Sorry?

272
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:01,743
Of course not.

273
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:06,706
I'm sure Woo-hyeol
was just trying to liven up the party.

274
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:07,874
I'm not asking about him.

275
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:11,002
I'm curious about how you feel.

276
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:12,253
Sorry?

277
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:14,631
You seem to treat him differently.

278
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:16,591
I do?

279
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,135
You said you know him well, right?

280
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:36,444
Did you know this about him?

281
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:48,206
What about everything you said to me?

282
00:20:48,957 --> 00:20:50,833
You asked me to wait just a little longer.

283
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:53,002
You said you'd keep your promise
no matter what.

284
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,356
I couldn't believe it at first, but--

285
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:14,482
Do-sik.

286
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:17,235
You didn't show this to anyone

287
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:19,612
other than me, did you?

288
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,197
No.

289
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,117
Let's keep this between us for now.

290
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:28,955
I'll explain everything later.

291
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:31,124
You knew about this?

292
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:39,465
I'm sorry for not being honest last time.

293
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,803
If you knew, how could you--

294
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:46,973
He's not a man
who's as dangerous as you think he is.

295
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:48,182
A "man"?

296
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,852
You call him that after seeing this?

297
00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:54,605
You don't know him.

298
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:58,151
You have no idea

299
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:01,446
what he's been through
and how he wants to live his life.

300
00:22:05,158 --> 00:22:06,868
Why should I?

301
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:11,205
I don't understand
why you're protecting this monster.

302
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:13,374
Ever since I found out about him...

303
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:17,003
No, ever since I found out
that a man was living with you,

304
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:18,671
you've been my biggest concern.

305
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:23,509
Have you ever thought
about why I'm doing this?

306
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:27,263
Have you ever tried to understand me
like you did him?

307
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:33,394
I'm sorry, Do-sik.

308
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:37,148
- In-hae.
- I have nothing more to say.

309
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:39,358
I'm sorry.

310
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:06,344
He's right.

311
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:10,348
Why do I keep worrying about Woo-hyeol?

312
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:33,621
What's all that noise?

313
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:44,132
Woo-hyeol, are you...

314
00:23:45,383 --> 00:23:46,843
What's going on?

315
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:48,136
Did we get robbed?

316
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:50,596
The scroll is gone.

317
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,973
What?

318
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:53,474
The scroll?

319
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:55,643
I've searched everywhere,

320
00:23:56,144 --> 00:23:57,311
and it's gone.

321
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:01,190
Are you sure
you didn't put it somewhere else?

322
00:24:01,524 --> 00:24:03,734
Think carefully.
When was the last time you saw it?

323
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:06,445
I was too careless.

324
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:08,197
I should've kept better care of it.

325
00:24:09,699 --> 00:24:12,743
Did you ask your friends
who came yesterday?

326
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:21,711
Hi, Woo-hyeol.

327
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:24,463
A scroll?

328
00:24:24,547 --> 00:24:26,132
No, I haven't seen it.

329
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:27,508
Hold on.

330
00:24:27,592 --> 00:24:30,011
Sang-hae, did you see a scroll
at Woo-hyeol's house?

331
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:31,679
What scroll? I haven't seen it.

332
00:24:32,263 --> 00:24:33,764
Sang-hae hasn't seen it either.

333
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:35,850
Is something wrong?

334
00:24:36,601 --> 00:24:37,560
Nothing's wrong.

335
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:39,103
I'll call you again.

336
00:24:41,272 --> 00:24:42,982
What's wrong? A scroll went missing?

337
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:45,443
Yes, that's what he said.

338
00:24:45,902 --> 00:24:47,820
It must be something precious.

339
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:50,281
Why do things always
disappear from that house?

340
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:51,490
The gold bars did too.

341
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:54,827
Now it's become clear.

342
00:24:54,911 --> 00:24:57,371
- What do you mean?
- There's a thief in that house.

343
00:25:00,917 --> 00:25:03,211
Your friends haven't seen it either?

344
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:09,425
Where on earth did it go?

345
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:15,181
You don't need to worry about it.

346
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:18,517
I didn't even know it was gone.

347
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:23,314
This is all

348
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,733
my fault.

349
00:25:26,234 --> 00:25:27,944
Don't be like that.

350
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:30,404
Let's search for it together.

351
00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:40,998
SEON WOO-HYEOL

352
00:25:41,624 --> 00:25:42,708
Seon Woo-hyeol.

353
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:46,587
You didn't call me once
after I left like that.

354
00:25:55,513 --> 00:25:56,597
Damn it.

355
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,106
What the...

356
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:16,951
You didn't say you were coming over.

357
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:19,912
You never pick up my calls anyway.

358
00:26:20,246 --> 00:26:22,248
Get lost if you're to pick a fight.

359
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:23,916
I'm not in the mood.

360
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:27,044
Is this about Seon Woo-hyeol again?

361
00:26:35,303 --> 00:26:37,805
I've never seen you like this before.

362
00:26:39,432 --> 00:26:40,599
What is it?

363
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,853
Do you really love him or something?

364
00:26:46,272 --> 00:26:49,400
I thought you were different
from people who cry over love.

365
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:51,235
But apparently, I was wrong.

366
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:53,112
You're really getting on my nerves
these days.

367
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:54,697
You keep crossing the line.

368
00:26:56,032 --> 00:26:57,366
I quit.

369
00:26:57,825 --> 00:27:01,078
I was only putting up
with your nonsense for money.

370
00:27:01,996 --> 00:27:05,124
But you're not paying me enough
for my services.

371
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:07,460
- What?
- It's no fun

372
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:09,378
hanging out with you anymore.

373
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:14,008
If you want money, do your job properly.

374
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:16,761
This wouldn't have happened
if you had done your job properly.

375
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:19,847
Everything would've ended well
if you had gotten me that mansion

376
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:21,724
when I told you to.

377
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:25,186
You shouldn't demand money
without doing your job properly.

378
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:27,897
I told you to look into Seon Woo-hyeol,

379
00:27:28,189 --> 00:27:29,982
and all you brought me was a scroll.

380
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,693
Yet you're asking me for more money?

381
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:36,238
Making money is no child's play, Man-hwi.

382
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:45,414
Do you have any idea

383
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:49,043
how much that scroll
means to Seon Woo-hyeol?

384
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:51,545
- What?
- The woman in the scroll

385
00:27:51,629 --> 00:27:53,130
who looks just like you

386
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:55,633
is his first love.

387
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:59,053
She's the reason
why he wants to become human.

388
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:01,138
You're not making sense.

389
00:28:01,222 --> 00:28:02,264
If you're curious,

390
00:28:05,142 --> 00:28:06,477
pay me good money.

391
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,520
Hey.

392
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:10,648
Lee Man-hwi.

393
00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:21,075
The reason why he wants to become human?

394
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:26,622
Is he saying he's not human or what?

395
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:30,167
Have you closed already?

396
00:28:31,252 --> 00:28:33,295
Staying open won't give me more customers.

397
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:34,713
It's just a waste of electricity.

398
00:28:35,673 --> 00:28:38,175
Goodness, my kid is growing by the day,

399
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:40,636
but I make less by the day.

400
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:43,013
But it's fun watching your kid grow up.

401
00:28:43,097 --> 00:28:45,975
Of course, Min-jae is such a sweetie.

402
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:49,311
But I feel bad for him.

403
00:28:50,438 --> 00:28:52,565
I also feel bad
for my father and grandfather.

404
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:56,026
My dream was to pass my shop on to my son,

405
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,279
but I'm barely keeping it alive.

406
00:28:58,362 --> 00:29:00,698
Don't say that in front of your kid.

407
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:02,658
You might not think so,
but kids know everything.

408
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:05,161
Of course, I know that.

409
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:06,537
Excuse me.

410
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:07,621
My goodness.

411
00:29:10,374 --> 00:29:11,375
What is it?

412
00:29:11,459 --> 00:29:15,629
Is there anything you know
about the mansion over there?

413
00:29:15,713 --> 00:29:16,881
Why do you ask?

414
00:29:18,382 --> 00:29:20,009
And who are you?

415
00:29:22,887 --> 00:29:24,138
I'm someone

416
00:29:26,015 --> 00:29:27,558
who's curious about the mansion.

417
00:29:28,017 --> 00:29:31,479
Do you know anyone
who used to frequent the mansion

418
00:29:31,562 --> 00:29:34,398
before the current residents moved in?

419
00:29:34,482 --> 00:29:35,649
Well...

420
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:38,986
He must be talking
about the owner of the mansion

421
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:40,738
who was against the redevelopment.

422
00:29:40,821 --> 00:29:42,156
Do you know anything about that person?

423
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:43,699
Not really.

424
00:29:44,408 --> 00:29:46,035
But I've seen him a few times.

425
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:47,453
- Do you know anything?
- No.

426
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:49,163
I don't know anything.

427
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:53,083
All I know is that he had a suit
tailored for a man a long time ago,

428
00:29:53,334 --> 00:29:54,877
and that man recently picked it up.

429
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,670
- He did?
- Yes, it's Mr. Ox Blood.

430
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,091
What is this about?

431
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,927
Did something happen to him?

432
00:30:03,928 --> 00:30:05,804
He's been missing for some time now.

433
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:07,806
- Missing?
- Missing?

434
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:09,934
What happened?

435
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:12,228
I wouldn't be here if I knew that.

436
00:30:13,521 --> 00:30:14,605
Could it be...

437
00:30:16,857 --> 00:30:17,858
Why is this...

438
00:30:17,942 --> 00:30:21,195
I saw a fancy car
that I'd never seen before

439
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:22,988
parked in our neighborhood,

440
00:30:23,489 --> 00:30:25,491
and it caught my attention.

441
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:28,994
I don't know if the owner was drunk,
but he could barely stand up straight.

442
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,330
He's completely wasted.

443
00:30:33,082 --> 00:30:35,918
At that time, I simply thought
that someone came to pick him up

444
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:37,378
because he was drunk.

445
00:30:37,461 --> 00:30:40,214
But I don't think
I've seen him ever since.

446
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:44,802
It's unsettling
to know that he went missing.

447
00:30:45,094 --> 00:30:47,263
Could it be that he was kidnapped?

448
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:48,222
Kidnapped?

449
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,101
Interesting.

450
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:57,356
Thank you for your valuable information.

451
00:31:00,651 --> 00:31:02,319
What on earth is going on?

452
00:31:08,951 --> 00:31:10,869
- Hey.
- Be quiet!

453
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:17,293
You're distracting me! Just sit down!

454
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:19,712
I can't. I have a hunch.

455
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:20,838
Hunch, my foot.

456
00:31:21,922 --> 00:31:23,799
He was loyal enough

457
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:26,343
to get Woo-hyeol's suit tailored
even before he woke up.

458
00:31:26,427 --> 00:31:29,013
But he suddenly stopped showing up.

459
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:32,057
According to the witness who saw him last,

460
00:31:32,141 --> 00:31:35,019
someone picked him up and drove off.

461
00:31:35,853 --> 00:31:38,772
Are you saying Butler Joo's father
was really kidnapped?

462
00:31:39,106 --> 00:31:40,983
Then who took those gold bars?

463
00:31:41,984 --> 00:31:43,402
Probably the kidnapper.

464
00:31:43,611 --> 00:31:46,155
They must have kidnapped
Butler Joo's father for the gold bars.

465
00:31:48,699 --> 00:31:50,409
I guess you have a point.

466
00:31:50,701 --> 00:31:53,120
We should tell
Woo-hyeol about this, right?

467
00:31:53,329 --> 00:31:54,371
Let's think about it.

468
00:31:54,455 --> 00:31:56,832
He must be stressed out as is

469
00:31:57,041 --> 00:31:58,584
about becoming human.

470
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:01,795
We shouldn't add to his worries.

471
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:23,317
Jeez, the scroll couldn't have
vanished into thin air.

472
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,902
Where on earth did it go?

473
00:32:58,936 --> 00:32:59,895
Are you okay?

474
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,273
Thank you. Since when were you here?

475
00:33:03,774 --> 00:33:04,775
I just came.

476
00:33:05,234 --> 00:33:06,443
Can you put me down?

477
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:08,362
Right.

478
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:15,160
What were you doing?

479
00:33:16,286 --> 00:33:17,788
I was looking for the scroll.

480
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:21,291
I said you don't have to.

481
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,878
But it means a lot to you.

482
00:33:29,883 --> 00:33:31,260
Why are you looking at me like that?

483
00:33:32,219 --> 00:33:33,303
I'm grateful.

484
00:33:35,723 --> 00:33:37,057
Thank you for your concern.

485
00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:56,910
Do you have any idea

486
00:33:56,994 --> 00:33:59,747
how much that scroll
means to Seon Woo-hyeol?

487
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:02,207
- What?
- The woman in the scroll

488
00:34:02,291 --> 00:34:05,419
who looks just like you is his first love.

489
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:10,591
Is this related
to that woman named Hae-sun?

490
00:34:12,134 --> 00:34:13,302
So why did you break up?

491
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:14,678
We didn't break up.

492
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:18,891
She passed away a long time ago.

493
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:20,809
And it was my fault.

494
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:23,562
When you and I first met,

495
00:34:24,146 --> 00:34:26,607
it felt as though
Hae-sun had come back to life.

496
00:34:27,191 --> 00:34:28,400
That's why I...

497
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:32,654
Am I Hae-sun?

498
00:34:45,042 --> 00:34:48,212
I don't know
if this can be any consolation,

499
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:53,050
but it's just a drawing after all.

500
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:55,719
The person you're looking for

501
00:34:55,803 --> 00:34:58,889
is the one who made you dream of love
that makes your heart beat.

502
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:02,935
What's important is your love for her.

503
00:35:04,228 --> 00:35:05,187
Don't you think so?

504
00:35:08,941 --> 00:35:09,942
You're right.

505
00:35:11,193 --> 00:35:13,570
It's just a drawing.

506
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:16,281
But I still feel bad.

507
00:35:17,658 --> 00:35:19,618
Not because I lost it,

508
00:35:20,369 --> 00:35:22,204
but because I wasn't even aware
that it was gone.

509
00:35:23,914 --> 00:35:26,124
It feels like I've wronged Hae-sun.

510
00:35:27,751 --> 00:35:30,754
Even if you don't end up finding it,

511
00:35:31,255 --> 00:35:33,340
don't be too disheartened.

512
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:36,885
I feel so devastated
about losing a mere drawing.

513
00:35:40,389 --> 00:35:42,307
I can't imagine
how you must feel not knowing

514
00:35:42,391 --> 00:35:44,017
whether or not your father is alive.

515
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:49,356
I'm always grateful to your ancestors.

516
00:35:51,608 --> 00:35:54,778
I feel greatly indebted
to those who protected this mansion

517
00:35:55,112 --> 00:35:56,572
while I was asleep.

518
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:59,032
And that includes your father.

519
00:36:01,034 --> 00:36:02,286
I'm grateful to all of them.

520
00:36:14,047 --> 00:36:14,923
Hello?

521
00:36:15,007 --> 00:36:16,133
Seon Woo-hyeol.

522
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:18,302
Who do you think you are?

523
00:36:19,136 --> 00:36:22,931
Who are you to drive me crazy?

524
00:36:24,266 --> 00:36:26,059
You asked me to wait.

525
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:28,729
How much longer

526
00:36:30,272 --> 00:36:32,941
do I have to wait for you?

527
00:36:34,818 --> 00:36:35,861
Ms. Na.

528
00:36:36,236 --> 00:36:37,821
- How much longer...
- Hello?

529
00:36:38,447 --> 00:36:39,364
Hello?

530
00:36:41,575 --> 00:36:42,701
What's going on?

531
00:36:43,452 --> 00:36:46,413
Ms. Na sounds quite drunk.

532
00:36:47,623 --> 00:36:49,207
Do you think you should go?

533
00:37:05,015 --> 00:37:06,016
Ms. Na.

534
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:09,937
Are you okay?

535
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,813
Oh, it's Seon Woo-hyeol.

536
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,942
Did you rush over as soon as I called you

537
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,736
because you were worried about me?

538
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:20,822
You're drunk. Let me take you home.

539
00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:22,115
Why?

540
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:23,867
I'm completely fine.

541
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:26,286
Do you want to have a drink with me?

542
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:30,082
No, thank you. I can't drink.

543
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:33,794
Why are you being like that?

544
00:37:45,973 --> 00:37:47,099
Mr. Seon.

545
00:37:47,975 --> 00:37:50,060
I thought you liked me.

546
00:37:51,645 --> 00:37:54,189
Stop confusing me.

547
00:37:56,191 --> 00:37:58,360
I'm going to be really angry

548
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:02,322
if you keep confusing me.

549
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:09,037
You don't want to see me angry.

550
00:38:11,707 --> 00:38:12,708
Where do you live?

551
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:13,959
I'll take you home.

552
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:31,893
He's late.

553
00:38:56,418 --> 00:38:57,461
Ms. Na.

554
00:38:59,004 --> 00:39:00,005
Ms. Na.

555
00:39:02,591 --> 00:39:03,508
All right.

556
00:39:04,384 --> 00:39:05,260
Here.

557
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,220
Sit down.

558
00:39:10,766 --> 00:39:13,018
Ms. Na, wake up.

559
00:39:15,479 --> 00:39:16,521
Don't go.

560
00:39:19,066 --> 00:39:20,901
You said you missed me.

561
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:24,488
You said not a day went by
without thinking of me.

562
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:28,533
Don't go anywhere

563
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:30,702
and stay with me.

564
00:39:33,747 --> 00:39:35,290
Stay by my side.

565
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:53,892
What's going on?

566
00:39:54,351 --> 00:39:55,435
Why do I smell blood?

567
00:40:03,819 --> 00:40:05,403
I have...

568
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:07,531
a bad feeling about this.

569
00:40:38,228 --> 00:40:40,689
He stayed out again without telling me?

570
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:52,159
The phone is turned off.

571
00:40:52,242 --> 00:40:54,119
You will be connected to voicemail.

572
00:41:01,293 --> 00:41:03,962
It's just a drawing.

573
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:06,798
I feel bad not because I lost it,

574
00:41:08,133 --> 00:41:10,051
but because I wasn't even aware
that it was gone.

575
00:41:11,303 --> 00:41:13,346
It feels like I've wronged Hae-sun.

576
00:41:17,058 --> 00:41:19,769
I'm sure he'll come back.

577
00:41:36,745 --> 00:41:37,996
Gosh, my head.

578
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:53,595
Are you feeling okay?

579
00:41:57,432 --> 00:41:59,351
Why did you drink so much?

580
00:41:59,726 --> 00:42:01,519
You couldn't even walk.

581
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:03,813
I had no choice.

582
00:42:03,897 --> 00:42:06,483
I couldn't stay sober.

583
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:11,071
I found out

584
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:13,114
about everything.

585
00:42:16,451 --> 00:42:17,535
I know

586
00:42:18,411 --> 00:42:20,413
why we met again like this.

587
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:31,299
Why is this...

588
00:42:33,593 --> 00:42:34,594
What's wrong?

589
00:42:34,678 --> 00:42:36,263
Are you surprised that I have this?

590
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,599
You didn't even seem to know
that it was gone.

591
00:42:41,434 --> 00:42:42,394
That's not--

592
00:42:42,477 --> 00:42:44,688
The things that you said to me
with me in your arms

593
00:42:44,771 --> 00:42:46,773
the day we first met
in front of the mansion.

594
00:42:47,399 --> 00:42:49,109
The look in your eyes and your expression.

595
00:42:50,777 --> 00:42:53,822
This drawing alone explains everything.

596
00:42:56,116 --> 00:42:57,284
This woman...

597
00:43:00,412 --> 00:43:01,538
is me, isn't she?

598
00:43:11,172 --> 00:43:12,549
Did this

599
00:43:13,425 --> 00:43:15,093
remind you of anything?

600
00:43:15,802 --> 00:43:18,680
Is there anything you want to ask me?

601
00:43:18,888 --> 00:43:20,223
So what happens now?

602
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,101
If I am

603
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:25,729
the woman in this drawing,

604
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:29,274
then what does that make you

605
00:43:29,649 --> 00:43:31,568
who has waited for this woman
for centuries?

606
00:43:33,028 --> 00:43:35,113
The fact that you've lived that long

607
00:43:35,697 --> 00:43:37,407
without aging or dying

608
00:43:38,283 --> 00:43:40,243
means that you're no ordinary human.

609
00:43:42,954 --> 00:43:44,497
Are you really

610
00:43:44,581 --> 00:43:45,874
not human?

611
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:15,987
It's beautiful.

612
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:21,743
You said she died for you.

613
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:26,081
Then shouldn't you be treating me better?

614
00:44:26,998 --> 00:44:28,291
First off,

615
00:44:28,375 --> 00:44:30,335
move out of that beat-up mansion.

616
00:44:31,127 --> 00:44:34,923
I can't bear to see you
live with Joo In-hae anymore.

617
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:40,887
I can't do that.

618
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:43,306
- What did you say?
- That mansion...

619
00:44:45,558 --> 00:44:47,060
is a place that holds

620
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:50,105
many precious memories
between me and Hae-sun.

621
00:44:51,272 --> 00:44:53,608
I have no intention of leaving it.

622
00:44:54,901 --> 00:44:55,860
That's great.

623
00:44:56,653 --> 00:44:59,072
Then all we have to do
is kick Joo In-hae out.

624
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:02,367
Anyway,

625
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:04,619
this obviously belongs to me,

626
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:06,079
so I'll keep it.

627
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:09,332
You didn't forget, did you?

628
00:45:09,416 --> 00:45:11,334
You said you'd keep our promise
no matter what.

629
00:45:12,669 --> 00:45:14,045
I'll return this to you

630
00:45:14,379 --> 00:45:16,631
when you do.

631
00:45:21,845 --> 00:45:25,515
It's just a drawing after all.

632
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:27,892
The person you're looking for

633
00:45:27,976 --> 00:45:31,146
is the one who made you dream of love
that makes your heart beat.

634
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:33,857
What's important is your love for her.

635
00:45:34,441 --> 00:45:35,316
Don't you think so?

636
00:45:36,526 --> 00:45:37,527
No.

637
00:45:40,071 --> 00:45:41,865
You don't need to return it.

638
00:45:42,866 --> 00:45:43,908
Why not?

639
00:45:52,834 --> 00:45:54,085
It's nothing more...

640
00:45:56,171 --> 00:45:57,213
than a drawing.

641
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:06,222
The person I'm waiting for...

642
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:11,978
is the one who taught me
what it's like to be loved

643
00:46:13,563 --> 00:46:15,899
and made me dream
of love that makes my heart beat,

644
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:18,776
not someone who simply looks like Hae-sun.

645
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:29,162
One more thing.

646
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:34,959
It's wrong to covet

647
00:46:36,294 --> 00:46:37,962
someone else's precious memories.

648
00:47:07,784 --> 00:47:10,578
We will meet again.

649
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:12,705
I will

650
00:47:13,414 --> 00:47:14,749
come find you.

651
00:47:15,959 --> 00:47:17,210
And when I do,

652
00:47:17,794 --> 00:47:19,379
let's love each other with all our hearts.

653
00:47:23,132 --> 00:47:24,175
Hae-sun.

654
00:47:24,676 --> 00:47:26,636
Me coming to this mansion,

655
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:28,513
the fact that I met you here...

656
00:47:29,097 --> 00:47:30,557
Welcome to Shaded Oasis.

657
00:47:31,015 --> 00:47:33,226
...and the way you look and talk to me.

658
00:47:33,643 --> 00:47:34,561
What is all this?

659
00:47:35,728 --> 00:47:38,022
Who are we to each other?

660
00:47:38,273 --> 00:47:40,775
People don't peel shrimp for just anyone.

661
00:47:41,234 --> 00:47:42,110
What do you think?

662
00:47:42,193 --> 00:47:44,153
This will be our secret hideout.

663
00:47:44,737 --> 00:47:47,782
Perhaps the reason why
I was so drawn to the mansion

664
00:47:48,283 --> 00:47:50,451
was to meet you.

665
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:53,413
You intrigue me, Mr. Seon.

666
00:47:53,788 --> 00:47:55,164
This is pretty.

667
00:47:55,957 --> 00:47:57,500
Doesn't it look like a star in bloom?

668
00:47:59,669 --> 00:48:01,713
Don't they look like stars in bloom?

669
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,301
Do you recall something?

670
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:08,636
Why do you look at me that way?

671
00:48:09,345 --> 00:48:12,640
As if I'm someone from your past.

672
00:48:39,292 --> 00:48:40,960
- Let's go.
- Why is it that moments like this

673
00:48:41,044 --> 00:48:42,670
always get interrupted?

674
00:48:44,589 --> 00:48:46,883
I'm leaving.
I'm not fit to be a third wheel.

675
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:50,219
You don't want to see me angry.

676
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:52,180
What's wrong?

677
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:54,015
Are you surprised that I have this?

678
00:48:54,432 --> 00:48:56,601
You didn't even seem to know
that it was gone.

679
00:48:57,143 --> 00:48:59,604
Then all we have to do
is kick Joo In-hae out.

680
00:49:04,776 --> 00:49:06,194
Where in the world

681
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:08,071
am I supposed to go now?

682
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:16,788
SHADED OASIS GUEST HOUSE

683
00:49:55,493 --> 00:49:56,619
Woo-hyeol!

684
00:50:10,049 --> 00:50:11,134
Why are you smiling?

685
00:50:11,843 --> 00:50:13,219
Your phone was off,

686
00:50:13,553 --> 00:50:15,179
and you didn't call me once!

687
00:50:16,848 --> 00:50:18,641
Do you know how worried I was?

688
00:50:20,184 --> 00:50:22,729
Where on earth were you?

689
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:36,784
What's wrong?

690
00:50:37,118 --> 00:50:38,995
Woo-hyeol.

691
00:50:39,829 --> 00:50:40,830
Woo-hyeol!

692
00:50:43,374 --> 00:50:44,208
Woo-hyeol.

693
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:45,877
Woo-hyeol, what's wrong?

694
00:50:46,169 --> 00:50:47,920
Wake up, Woo-hyeol.

695
00:50:48,004 --> 00:50:48,838
Woo-hyeol!

696
00:50:51,966 --> 00:50:54,218
Woo-hyeol, can you hear me?

697
00:50:57,847 --> 00:50:59,265
Should we hire a private detective

698
00:51:00,016 --> 00:51:02,268
to find Butler Joo's father?

699
00:51:02,351 --> 00:51:04,979
They're experts,
so they must be better than us.

700
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:06,230
Do you have money?

701
00:51:06,773 --> 00:51:08,274
We're barely making a living right now.

702
00:51:10,985 --> 00:51:12,111
Woo-hyeol!

703
00:51:12,195 --> 00:51:13,821
Wake up, Woo-hyeol!

704
00:51:17,158 --> 00:51:18,951
Hang on.

705
00:51:19,869 --> 00:51:20,828
Let me see.

706
00:51:25,458 --> 00:51:27,460
No, I can't take him to the hospital.

707
00:51:28,669 --> 00:51:29,670
What do I do?

708
00:51:30,797 --> 00:51:31,839
Woo-hyeol.

709
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:35,843
Woo-hyeol!

710
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:38,513
- Over here! Hurry!
- What happened?

711
00:51:39,263 --> 00:51:41,098
Woo-hyeol, wake up!

712
00:51:42,266 --> 00:51:43,392
Woo-hyeol!

713
00:51:49,524 --> 00:51:50,566
Goodness.

714
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:54,821
What on earth is happening?
How can a vampire collapse?

715
00:51:58,449 --> 00:52:01,244
Thank you for getting him here.

716
00:52:01,327 --> 00:52:02,370
Don't mention it.

717
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:04,622
He's our family.
We should be thanking you.

718
00:52:06,791 --> 00:52:07,625
Sang-hae.

719
00:52:07,708 --> 00:52:09,210
Let's give him this.

720
00:52:18,678 --> 00:52:20,805
Where did you get that blood pack?

721
00:52:21,097 --> 00:52:22,431
It's none of your business.

722
00:52:22,723 --> 00:52:26,561
I should know what to do
if this happens again.

723
00:52:28,062 --> 00:52:31,107
These are hard to come by,
so don't even dream of it.

724
00:52:34,819 --> 00:52:37,572
Does this happen often to him?

725
00:52:38,948 --> 00:52:42,618
No, he got drunk on human food
a few times,

726
00:52:42,702 --> 00:52:45,288
but I've never seen him
collapse like this.

727
00:52:47,206 --> 00:52:48,207
Why?

728
00:52:48,291 --> 00:52:49,625
Is it serious?

729
00:52:49,876 --> 00:52:53,838
Well, it's not normal
for a vampire to be laying in bed unwell.

730
00:52:54,755 --> 00:52:57,258
This is happening
because he's half-human and half-vampire.

731
00:53:00,595 --> 00:53:03,556
His complexion is improving
after drinking blood.

732
00:53:05,474 --> 00:53:07,852
- Woo-hyeol.
- Seop, let him rest.

733
00:53:07,935 --> 00:53:09,854
- Okay.
- Leave him alone.

734
00:53:18,029 --> 00:53:19,405
He'll be fine, right?

735
00:53:20,948 --> 00:53:22,742
Mr. Ko told us to keep an eye on him.

736
00:53:24,827 --> 00:53:26,203
It's been bothering me.

737
00:53:26,287 --> 00:53:27,330
I know.

738
00:53:27,413 --> 00:53:30,166
What if something terrible happens?

739
00:53:31,083 --> 00:53:34,921
We'd feel a lot better
once he becomes human.

740
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:37,715
I think

741
00:53:37,798 --> 00:53:40,468
- we should move into Shaded Oasis.
- What?

742
00:53:40,551 --> 00:53:42,345
It's dangerous
for a human woman to be alone.

743
00:53:42,428 --> 00:53:44,388
And who's to say he won't collapse again?

744
00:53:44,472 --> 00:53:45,473
Right.

745
00:53:45,556 --> 00:53:47,183
Plus, they're raising our house deposit.

746
00:53:47,558 --> 00:53:48,851
We can't afford it.

747
00:53:49,393 --> 00:53:50,353
You're right.

748
00:53:56,609 --> 00:53:58,819
You don't know him.

749
00:53:59,195 --> 00:54:00,655
You have no idea

750
00:54:01,405 --> 00:54:04,867
what he's been through
and how he wants to live his life.

751
00:54:05,785 --> 00:54:08,079
Just what does he mean to her?

752
00:54:18,464 --> 00:54:19,340
Mr. Shin,

753
00:54:20,174 --> 00:54:21,676
you have a guest.

754
00:54:22,802 --> 00:54:23,886
A guest?

755
00:54:33,187 --> 00:54:35,022
You have a great office.

756
00:54:35,106 --> 00:54:35,982
Who are you?

757
00:54:41,654 --> 00:54:45,241
I'm here to offer my help.

758
00:54:45,533 --> 00:54:46,617
Help?

759
00:54:46,867 --> 00:54:49,370
I heard you were looking
for a half-vampire.

760
00:55:04,218 --> 00:55:05,803
It must've been tough for him.

761
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:33,122
Once when I was little,

762
00:55:34,206 --> 00:55:36,083
I had

763
00:55:36,584 --> 00:55:38,335
a bad cold.

764
00:55:39,879 --> 00:55:41,505
My mom told me...

765
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:45,593
it was part of growing up.

766
00:55:47,553 --> 00:55:51,098
That I would have grown much bigger
by the time I recovered.

767
00:55:53,726 --> 00:55:56,854
Everything will be fine once you recover.

768
00:56:00,149 --> 00:56:02,026
I'll stay by your side.

769
00:56:04,153 --> 00:56:05,780
Take your time

770
00:56:06,989 --> 00:56:08,449
to get better

771
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:10,785
and get back on your feet.

772
00:56:57,957 --> 00:56:58,874
Woo-hyeol,

773
00:56:59,458 --> 00:57:00,292
are you okay?

774
00:57:05,256 --> 00:57:08,134
Were you here all night?

775
00:57:08,509 --> 00:57:11,303
There was nothing I could do

776
00:57:11,387 --> 00:57:13,013
except stay by your side.

777
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:16,684
I know what to do when people are sick,

778
00:57:16,767 --> 00:57:20,855
but I have no idea what to do
when you're sick.

779
00:57:24,024 --> 00:57:25,734
I got scared

780
00:57:27,653 --> 00:57:29,530
that something might happen to you.

781
00:57:30,948 --> 00:57:32,199
I was scared

782
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:36,662
that I might not be
able to see you again...

783
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:40,916
like my mom and dad.

784
00:57:44,712 --> 00:57:46,088
I want you

785
00:57:47,131 --> 00:57:48,549
to stay by my side for a long time

786
00:57:49,717 --> 00:57:52,595
and never go anywhere.

787
00:57:54,263 --> 00:57:56,223
I think I'd be devastated

788
00:57:57,725 --> 00:57:59,435
if you weren't in this world.

789
00:58:03,272 --> 00:58:05,024
I know there's only one person

790
00:58:05,524 --> 00:58:07,693
in your heart.

791
00:58:08,861 --> 00:58:09,987
But even then,

792
00:58:10,779 --> 00:58:11,822
I think

793
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:14,950
I should tell you

794
00:58:15,743 --> 00:58:17,995
because I've never felt like this before.

795
00:58:21,207 --> 00:58:22,791
I think...

796
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:30,466
I have feelings for you, Woo-hyeol.

797
00:59:30,901 --> 00:59:33,904
HEARTBEAT

798
00:59:34,113 --> 00:59:36,991
Love is about doing everything together.

799
00:59:37,241 --> 00:59:39,576
When you see something funny

800
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:42,037
or eat something delicious,
you want to share it with that person.

801
00:59:42,246 --> 00:59:44,248
Are you really going to
give me your blood?

802
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:46,917
You said you can become human
if you drink it.

803
00:59:47,001 --> 00:59:48,085
Does this mean you'll become human now?

804
00:59:48,168 --> 00:59:49,211
Why do I have to watch them

805
00:59:49,295 --> 00:59:51,338
be in love in the guest house
that I invested in?

806
00:59:51,422 --> 00:59:53,048
I'll make sure it never happens.

807
00:59:53,132 --> 00:59:56,093
Between you and Butler Joo,
only one can live.

808
00:59:56,302 --> 00:59:57,845
Why is my heart beating so fast?

809
00:59:57,928 --> 00:59:58,846
What do you think you're doing?!

810
00:59:59,096 --> 01:00:00,806
Are you really
going to kill her or something?

811
01:00:01,098 --> 01:00:02,099
To become human,

812
01:00:02,641 --> 01:00:05,102
you must suck her dry of her blood.

813
01:00:09,231 --> 01:00:11,233
