00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:45,296
HEARTBEAT

2
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,298
ALL CHARACTERS, NAMES,
ORGANIZATIONS, GROUPS, EVENTS,

3
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,383
AND SETTINGS ARE FICTITIOUS
AND ANIMAL SAFETY GUIDELINES WERE FOLLOWED

4
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:04,815
Ms. Na?

5
00:01:08,444 --> 00:01:10,696
What brings you by at this hour?

6
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:13,949
I was nearby, so I thought I'd stop by.

7
00:01:14,325 --> 00:01:15,284
I see.

8
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:18,037
If that's what suits you, then go ahead.

9
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:24,960
Hae-sun.

10
00:01:26,629 --> 00:01:27,755
You found me...

11
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:31,842
just as you promised.

12
00:01:40,059 --> 00:01:41,143
No way.

13
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:44,855
I missed you.

14
00:01:46,816 --> 00:01:47,983
Not a day went by

15
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,028
without thinking of you.

16
00:02:13,843 --> 00:02:15,302
Thank you

17
00:02:15,386 --> 00:02:16,679
for finding me

18
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,681
as you promised.

19
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:21,267
Thank you so much, Hae-sun.

20
00:02:25,563 --> 00:02:26,397
By the way...

21
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:28,774
have we met before?

22
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:34,572
There's no way I don't remember
someone this handsome.

23
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:36,532
Hae-sun.

24
00:02:38,242 --> 00:02:39,285
It's me.

25
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:42,872
Do you really not remember me?

26
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:50,337
Seon Woo-hyeol.

27
00:02:51,422 --> 00:02:53,507
He's joking, right?

28
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:56,385
Joking?

29
00:02:57,011 --> 00:02:59,555
I've desperately longed for you, Hae-sun.

30
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:01,140
You got my name wrong.

31
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,601
It's Hae-won, not Hae-sun.

32
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:04,560
Na Hae-won.

33
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:08,105
I'm sorry, Ms. Na.

34
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,273
He must've startled you.

35
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,359
He's lived too long, so...

36
00:03:12,735 --> 00:03:16,030
I mean, he lived abroad for too long,

37
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,657
so he can go a bit overboard sometimes.

38
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:21,577
Please understand.

39
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:25,247
Woo-hyeol,

40
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:27,333
you crossed the line there.

41
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:31,420
Calm down, okay?

42
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:33,422
Hey, calm down.

43
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:37,509
Mr. Seon Woo-hyeol, right?

44
00:03:38,344 --> 00:03:41,722
But really, have we met before?

45
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:49,688
You're as attractive as this mansion.

46
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:51,732
It was a pleasure meeting you.

47
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:53,567
See you again.

48
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:04,870
Woo-hyeol.

49
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:13,629
My apologies.

50
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:18,509
I was delighted to see you,
so I overstepped my boundaries.

51
00:04:20,386 --> 00:04:21,345
See you again.

52
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:36,777
HEARTBEAT
EPISODE 7

53
00:04:45,411 --> 00:04:46,412
Hae-sun.

54
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:49,915
How can someone

55
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:54,169
wait and long for another for so long?

56
00:05:09,727 --> 00:05:10,769
We...

57
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:13,022
will meet again.

58
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,691
I will

59
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:17,151
come find you.

60
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:20,779
And when I do,

61
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,615
let's love each other with all our hearts.

62
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:31,957
Is it okay...

63
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,543
if I come in?

64
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,024
Are you okay?

65
00:06:02,071 --> 00:06:04,406
She really does look a lot like her.

66
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:09,203
No wonder she seemed familiar.

67
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:11,872
Hae-sun

68
00:06:12,331 --> 00:06:14,041
kept the promise she made to me.

69
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,795
She said she'd come find me.

70
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:21,131
Meanwhile,

71
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,383
I failed to become human.

72
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:27,096
I'm sorry.

73
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:34,269
What can I do?

74
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:38,732
It is what it is.

75
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:45,781
You think Ms. Na
is a reincarnation of Hae-sun, right?

76
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:47,574
It felt

77
00:06:48,826 --> 00:06:50,452
as if Hae-sun came back.

78
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:54,540
That's why I couldn't help myself.

79
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:58,127
I understand how you feel,

80
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:02,714
but she might've felt flustered.

81
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:06,510
Nobody remembers their past lives.

82
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:11,390
Try to put yourself in her shoes.

83
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:22,776
I missed you.

84
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:26,196
Not a day went by

85
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:29,241
without thinking of you.

86
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:32,661
What an unusual person.

87
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:54,808
The world may flip upside down,

88
00:07:56,018 --> 00:07:59,354
but those who are meant to be
will end up together.

89
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,738
The moon is shining brightly tonight.

90
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:13,994
DONG-SEOP SNACK SHOP

91
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:19,750
There were only three people who knew

92
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:23,003
that the gold bars were hidden
beneath the coffin.

93
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,963
Me, you,

94
00:08:25,047 --> 00:08:26,048
and Butler Joo.

95
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:27,841
So?

96
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:29,885
What do you mean?

97
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:31,803
Neither of us took the gold bars,

98
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:33,055
so who's the one left?

99
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:35,265
Are you suspecting Butler Joo right now?

100
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:38,602
He's been dead for decades.
That doesn't make any sense.

101
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:39,811
Why doesn't it make sense?

102
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:43,106
They say you can never truly know
everything about someone.

103
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,858
I definitely still don't know you.

104
00:08:44,942 --> 00:08:47,027
Are you saying
we dig up Butler Joo's grave?

105
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:47,986
Have you lost it?

106
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:51,114
He would've been crazy
to take all the gold into his grave.

107
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:53,825
I'm sure he hid them somewhere
for his descendants

108
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:56,495
who have to live as vampire butlers
for generations.

109
00:08:56,954 --> 00:08:58,538
What's the point of doing that

110
00:08:58,622 --> 00:09:00,707
when Woo-hyeol would find out
when he wakes up anyway?

111
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,126
"Have you seen my gold bars?"

112
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:05,963
"No, I haven't."
They just need to play dumb.

113
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,631
Look at the current butler.

114
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:10,550
She insists that the mansion is hers.
Don't you see it?

115
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:12,678
It's strange, isn't it?

116
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,513
Think about it.

117
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:16,265
Don't speak ill of the dead.

118
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:18,934
Goodness.

119
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:20,018
You're here.

120
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:21,520
Damn you.

121
00:09:24,273 --> 00:09:26,483
Butler Joo fulfilled his duty admirably

122
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:29,736
by not selling the house
and holding on to it.

123
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,949
It was his job to keep the gold safe too.

124
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:35,284
Gosh.

125
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:39,913
They stole your gold
and opened the coffin too soon.

126
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:41,581
What's wrong with the Joo family?

127
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:43,166
Are they holding a grudge against you?

128
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:47,963
You never should've left the gold
with a complete stranger.

129
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:49,131
If you had left them with us--

130
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:51,550
We would've spent everything.

131
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:52,759
That sounds likely.

132
00:09:57,222 --> 00:10:00,183
I'm here to tell you guys something.

133
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,188
Hae-sun

134
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:06,398
came to the house.

135
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:16,491
So you just let her go?

136
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:20,954
Woo-hyeol.

137
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,421
This isn't what I had in mind.

138
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:32,966
I thought...

139
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,511
I would be human

140
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,930
and Hae-sun would recognize me.

141
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:44,936
And I thought we would love each other
with all our hearts.

142
00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:52,027
Woo-hyeol, you're almost there.

143
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:55,072
You've held out until now
for that one goal.

144
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:56,740
When you become human by drinking

145
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,617
that woman's blood
after she falls in love,

146
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,494
you'll be able to love
with all your heart.

147
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:04,623
He's right. Don't think too much.

148
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:07,000
Just focus on becoming human.

149
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:11,421
As for the gold, I was out of line,

150
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:12,714
but we'll take care of it.

151
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:14,257
Yes, don't worry.

152
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:16,426
- Lighten up.
- Please.

153
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,285
Woo-hyeol.

154
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:47,207
Where have you been?

155
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,043
Just out.

156
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:54,047
I have a lot on my mind.

157
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:56,883
Do you have something to say?

158
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:59,136
Well, no.

159
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:01,930
You were gone all day,
so I was wondering where you were.

160
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,100
Rest up.

161
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:30,959
You make these yourself?

162
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:33,044
They're not for sale.

163
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:36,715
Why did you bail out yesterday?

164
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:40,218
You should report back after your patrol.

165
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,097
I'm sorry.

166
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:45,932
Participate in the patrol

167
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:48,059
even if I don't ask you from now on.

168
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:50,145
It's on the second and fourth Monday
of the month for an hour.

169
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:52,272
That often?

170
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:55,567
Why? If you're not up for it,
you can't live in this neighborhood.

171
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:58,945
Things like this should be voluntary.
You can't force people to--

172
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:02,324
Do you think we patrol because we want to?

173
00:13:02,908 --> 00:13:06,411
We wouldn't be doing this
if the area had been redeveloped.

174
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:08,538
That hideous mansion

175
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:10,916
has been causing everyone so much trouble.

176
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,627
There were talks of redevelopment?

177
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:16,755
Yes, but the owner of the mansion
adamantly refused to sell his property

178
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:17,672
so it never happened.

179
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:21,760
Have you ever seen him?

180
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:26,723
Yes, but it was when there were
talks about the redevelopment.

181
00:13:27,516 --> 00:13:28,683
So it's been a while.

182
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:30,227
Why do you ask?

183
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,771
Oh, it's nothing.

184
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:34,648
Let me ask you a question.

185
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:38,777
Is there a reason why
you're living in that run-down house?

186
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,530
A guest house?

187
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:47,619
They're going to open up a guest house
in that mansion?

188
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:48,995
That's what she said.

189
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:51,206
Come on, that's ridiculous.

190
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:53,875
Who would want to stay
in that haunted house?

191
00:13:56,628 --> 00:13:57,504
Tell me about it.

192
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:00,423
Maybe it's a good thing.

193
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:03,677
I bet they'll throw in the towel
after a few months.

194
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,179
You're right. There's not much
to this neighborhood anyway.

195
00:14:06,263 --> 00:14:07,639
Don't say that.

196
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,684
Right, I have to pay you
for the pork cutlet.

197
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:11,726
Forget it.

198
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,520
- I should still pay you.
- Forget it.

199
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:15,480
- Here.
- I'm leaving.

200
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:17,274
Goodbye, ma'am.

201
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:18,483
Bye, sweetie.

202
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:22,237
Enjoy the pork cutlet.
I'll make more for you again.

203
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,531
- Thank you.
- All right.

204
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,241
Thanks.

205
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:29,119
- Freeze it if you don't eat it right away.
- We'll eat it right away.

206
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:50,098
Woo-hyeol.

207
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:52,392
Have this.

208
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:54,144
What's gotten into you?

209
00:14:57,147 --> 00:14:59,899
You seemed down,
so I wanted to make you feel better.

210
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:07,741
I've given it some thought.

211
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:10,952
How about we invite Ms. Na over?

212
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:12,329
Ms. Na?

213
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,080
Yes, the one you saw the other day.

214
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:18,209
She's the one who wants to invest
in our guest house.

215
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,258
You should try to get to know her

216
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:27,260
and also make up
for what you did last time.

217
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:32,307
What's wrong?

218
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:34,225
I've given it some thought.

219
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:36,978
And I think you're right.

220
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:38,438
About what?

221
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,776
She's living a good life
without having any idea

222
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:44,277
about her former life.

223
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:48,365
Showing up out of the blue
and confusing her

224
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:49,616
is the last thing I want to do.

225
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:54,579
I'm not sure

226
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:59,959
if I'm doing her any good
by showing up in front of her.

227
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:02,712
Above all else,

228
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,090
it pains me to face her

229
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:08,927
when I failed to become human

230
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:12,013
and am still half-vampire.

231
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:15,183
Don't think of her as Hae-sun.

232
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,396
As I said,
no one remembers their past lives.

233
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:24,275
Don't think of her as the Hae-sun
who only lives in your memories.

234
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:26,820
Think of her as the Hae-won she is now.

235
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:31,199
They say true feelings always
find their way.

236
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:33,535
You've been waiting for her
for such a long time.

237
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:35,704
If you're true to her,
then she'll feel it too.

238
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,459
I'll help you.

239
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:44,337
You?

240
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:46,131
Help me?

241
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:02,981
Goodness.

242
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:06,985
The moon is bright tonight,

243
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:09,487
there's a shadow cast on your face.

244
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:11,489
Mr. Ko.

245
00:17:11,573 --> 00:17:13,074
You seem troubled.

246
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:31,050
Hae-sun appeared before me.

247
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:34,179
You knew?

248
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:38,391
When you live as long as I do,
there's little that you don't know.

249
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,895
I've lived for so long,

250
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,980
but I'm still clueless.

251
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:46,149
You seem laid-back.

252
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,818
- Sorry?
- If Hae-sun showed up,

253
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:50,528
you should become human
as fast as you can.

254
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:52,572
There's no time for you
to be indulging in sadness.

255
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:56,951
You said you want to experience love
that makes your heart beat.

256
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:00,872
Isn't that what you told me a century ago?

257
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,375
Yes, I did.

258
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:08,463
It's dangerous to be
on the border of two beings.

259
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:12,300
So hurry and get her to fall in love
so you can drink her blood

260
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:13,885
and become human.

261
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,055
Go experience love
that makes your heart beat.

262
00:19:04,936 --> 00:19:07,689
REFRESH REAL ESTATE CONSULTING

263
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,488
- Hello?
- Hello?

264
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:18,616
Mr. Seon?

265
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,993
Are you busy?

266
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:21,870
Yes, a bit.

267
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:23,746
What's going on?

268
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:25,665
Will you leave her like this?

269
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:27,917
Sorry? What do you mean?

270
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:29,460
You said you wanted to protect her.

271
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:33,131
Shouldn't you share her burdens?

272
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:38,011
I'm not sure if I understand.

273
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:40,555
I'm talking about Joo In-hae.

274
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:42,515
She's been stressed out all day

275
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:44,058
doing research for the guest house.

276
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:48,479
You know she's not one to ask for help.

277
00:19:49,564 --> 00:19:51,900
If you offered to help,
shouldn't you follow through?

278
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:58,072
But why would you tell me this?

279
00:20:00,575 --> 00:20:03,411
It was frustrating
to see her that way all day.

280
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:05,163
Goodbye then.

281
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:17,967
It's dangerous to be
on the border of two beings.

282
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:21,930
So hurry and get her to fall in love
so you can drink her blood

283
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:23,640
and become human.

284
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,112
Hi, Do-sik.

285
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:39,197
Hey, In-hae.

286
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:44,202
Do you want to go look at furniture
and appliances for the guest house today?

287
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:45,370
Really?

288
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:47,330
I was doing some research online,

289
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:49,415
but I wanted to see them in real life.

290
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:51,668
It'd be great if you could help me.

291
00:20:52,043 --> 00:20:53,836
They'll rip you off
if you look inexperienced.

292
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:56,297
Let's go together and pick out some stuff.

293
00:20:56,381 --> 00:20:58,341
- Okay, see you later.
- Okay.

294
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:07,642
Hello. We just opened.

295
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:10,645
- Hello.
- Please take a look.

296
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:16,401
What the heck?

297
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,653
How ridiculous.

298
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:19,779
My goodness.

299
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:23,950
Are you here to eat tteokbokki?

300
00:21:24,534 --> 00:21:25,410
- Yes.
- Yes.

301
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:26,703
Come this way.

302
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,287
Excuse me.

303
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:31,249
What's wrong with him?

304
00:21:35,378 --> 00:21:36,462
Seop!

305
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:38,381
Are you crazy?

306
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:45,388
I've been watching them,

307
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:47,932
and people seem to love these things.

308
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:49,892
So I also gave it a try.

309
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:51,394
Who on earth would like that?

310
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,479
Are you trying to go out of business?

311
00:21:53,563 --> 00:21:55,690
You should attract customers,
not scare them away.

312
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:58,276
Tell me about it. He's hopeless.

313
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:01,612
People only like fake vampires.
Real ones freak them out.

314
00:22:01,696 --> 00:22:02,905
It'll be chaos.

315
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:05,033
You're right.

316
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:07,744
I was blinded by my greed for money

317
00:22:08,036 --> 00:22:09,454
and couldn't think straight.

318
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:16,169
This is why we should
hurry and find the gold bars.

319
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:18,087
Gold bars?

320
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,840
What's going on?
Is it like a treasure hunt?

321
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:22,300
It's none of your business.

322
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:23,468
Why not?

323
00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:25,595
I love gold too. Bling-bling.

324
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:28,222
How can we find them
when we don't even know who took them?

325
00:22:30,433 --> 00:22:32,226
We even get to play detective?

326
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:34,145
So someone stole them?

327
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:35,480
I said it's none of your business!

328
00:22:35,563 --> 00:22:38,483
What do you mean?
What's been stolen must be reclaimed.

329
00:22:39,317 --> 00:22:41,903
What are you doing? Get moving.

330
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:45,782
Too bad I have to work.

331
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:49,118
Everybody, return to the scene first.

332
00:22:49,452 --> 00:22:50,411
Hurry up.

333
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:53,039
- Move!
- Move!

334
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:54,916
- What about my shop?
- Business is slow anyway.

335
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:56,542
Let's go. Where do we go though?

336
00:23:09,097 --> 00:23:11,849
Mr. Shin,
I cleaned the car inside and out.

337
00:23:11,933 --> 00:23:13,059
Thank you.

338
00:23:14,352 --> 00:23:16,187
Please get in. Let me drive you.

339
00:23:16,771 --> 00:23:17,772
Mr. Gu.

340
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:20,233
I have someone
I want to drive myself today.

341
00:23:20,942 --> 00:23:23,069
I'm going to Gongcheon-dong.

342
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:25,613
Right.

343
00:23:42,964 --> 00:23:43,840
Where are you going?

344
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:47,093
Do-sik is helping me choose furniture
and appliances for the guest house.

345
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:48,970
Oh, is that right?

346
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,681
Will you be home late today?

347
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:53,766
Well, I don't know.

348
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:56,185
Anyway, I'll be back.

349
00:23:56,894 --> 00:23:58,146
All right.

350
00:24:04,277 --> 00:24:05,903
He's following my order very well.

351
00:24:07,655 --> 00:24:08,781
This is great.

352
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:12,702
I need her to fall in love
so I can become human.

353
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:15,121
Yes, this is good.

354
00:24:15,705 --> 00:24:18,416
Be a man and push forward!

355
00:24:22,295 --> 00:24:23,379
Push forward.

356
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:30,094
All right, the width is 850.

357
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,805
The length is 1 600.

358
00:24:32,889 --> 00:24:35,183
The table is perfect for four people.

359
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:36,726
Sit down and check the height.

360
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:37,894
Okay.

361
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:41,647
The height is 730.

362
00:24:41,731 --> 00:24:43,357
We have newer products too.

363
00:24:43,441 --> 00:24:45,860
No wonder. These look a bit outdated.

364
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:46,986
This is it.

365
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:49,697
This goes well with that furniture.

366
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:52,033
You're right.
This is what's on that chair, right?

367
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:53,034
It is.

368
00:24:53,117 --> 00:24:55,244
Then I'll take about eight of these.

369
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:56,579
How much is it?

370
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:58,206
I'll give you wholesale prices.

371
00:24:58,289 --> 00:24:59,498
- Really?
- Of course.

372
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:01,834
How about this one?

373
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:05,046
Do-sik, wouldn't this go well
with the wood interior?

374
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:06,797
- They all look great.
- Really?

375
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:08,382
Which one is better?

376
00:25:08,633 --> 00:25:10,134
- Isn't this one better?
- This?

377
00:25:10,218 --> 00:25:12,929
- These might come in handy.
- They're good to have.

378
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:15,139
- A spoon rest?
- Yes.

379
00:25:15,473 --> 00:25:16,390
I like...

380
00:25:16,891 --> 00:25:18,559
Maybe these two are better.

381
00:25:18,643 --> 00:25:20,895
- Do-sik, what about this?
- Cotton...

382
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:21,938
This?

383
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:23,564
Oh, it's nice.

384
00:25:23,898 --> 00:25:24,857
It's nice, isn't it?

385
00:25:24,941 --> 00:25:26,859
- It is.
- It's popular among newlyweds these days.

386
00:25:26,943 --> 00:25:30,071
Oh, we're not married.

387
00:25:31,072 --> 00:25:31,989
No?

388
00:25:37,328 --> 00:25:39,288
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

389
00:25:39,747 --> 00:25:40,915
This looks so good.

390
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:43,626
I'm famished from all the walking.

391
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:45,378
- Same. Let's eat.
- Okay.

392
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:48,506
- Enjoy.
- Enjoy.

393
00:25:55,388 --> 00:25:56,514
It's so good!

394
00:25:57,932 --> 00:25:59,016
Eat up.

395
00:26:01,018 --> 00:26:02,144
Back in college,

396
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:04,981
whenever you saw me eating
food from the convenience store,

397
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:08,234
you'd take me to a restaurant.

398
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:10,736
Do you remember that place
near our school?

399
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,029
- The budaejjigae restaurant.
- The budaejjigae restaurant.

400
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:15,741
Of course, I remember.
We used to go there all the time.

401
00:26:16,659 --> 00:26:17,910
I wonder if it's still there.

402
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:19,245
Should we go next time?

403
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:27,920
Thank you.

404
00:26:28,004 --> 00:26:29,088
GRILLED FISH AND PORK BELLY

405
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:30,798
In-hae, wait here for a bit.

406
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:32,258
I'll go get the car.

407
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:34,010
- Okay.
- All right.

408
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:38,889
Give it to Daddy. It's heavy.

409
00:26:38,973 --> 00:26:41,642
It's okay. I can carry this much.

410
00:26:42,727 --> 00:26:45,104
Goodness, look how strong my girl is.

411
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:47,773
Slow down. Be careful.

412
00:26:47,857 --> 00:26:48,983
Good job.

413
00:26:49,066 --> 00:26:51,444
I'm so proud of you.

414
00:26:58,326 --> 00:27:00,494
Get in. I'll load them.

415
00:27:00,578 --> 00:27:02,371
Let me help.

416
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:05,458
Come in.

417
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:09,003
Is it okay for us to come in?

418
00:27:09,086 --> 00:27:10,338
It's fine.

419
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:12,506
No one's home. Come on in.

420
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:24,977
This feels so nice.

421
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:30,691
I've been cooped up
in my tiny rooftop house,

422
00:27:30,775 --> 00:27:31,942
but now I can finally breathe.

423
00:27:32,026 --> 00:27:33,944
It's been so long
since we last gathered here.

424
00:27:38,324 --> 00:27:39,909
He's going through male menopause again.

425
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:42,036
I've lost count.

426
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:45,081
I think it's his 16th one.

427
00:27:46,499 --> 00:27:47,917
It's all my fault.

428
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:51,253
I should've taken better care of you
as your leader.

429
00:27:51,504 --> 00:27:52,922
I'm sorry.

430
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,048
Don't apologize.

431
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,095
Which brings us to this.

432
00:28:00,388 --> 00:28:01,347
I present to you,

433
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:02,598
Gold Bar Search Party!

434
00:28:02,932 --> 00:28:05,726
Get rid of the magnifying glass.
I don't want to see your face enlarged.

435
00:28:09,063 --> 00:28:12,066
Would there be any clues left
after all this time?

436
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:13,943
We'll know after investigating.

437
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:16,445
Let's head to the scene first.

438
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:28,874
Is anything even there?

439
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:34,547
Gosh, my eyes.

440
00:28:35,256 --> 00:28:37,508
You can see everything with the naked eye.

441
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:38,426
Stop making a fuss.

442
00:28:38,843 --> 00:28:40,344
Just hold on.

443
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:42,221
I'm going to find something.

444
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:43,973
All right.

445
00:28:51,272 --> 00:28:53,691
- There's nothing.
- Goodness.

446
00:28:58,529 --> 00:28:59,738
Wait, don't move!

447
00:29:05,286 --> 00:29:06,203
Found it.

448
00:29:14,879 --> 00:29:16,046
Hey.

449
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:19,049
- What's with you?
- Jeez.

450
00:29:22,803 --> 00:29:24,680
Goodness.

451
00:29:26,307 --> 00:29:27,600
I know what this is.

452
00:29:29,435 --> 00:29:30,644
It's a cat whisker!

453
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:33,355
- Cat whisker?
- Cat whisker?

454
00:29:34,982 --> 00:29:36,066
Then could it be...

455
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:39,904
Mr. Ko?

456
00:29:41,572 --> 00:29:45,284
Who told you you could become human
by sleeping in the hawthorn coffin?

457
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:48,287
Mr. Ko.

458
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:49,663
Who's the only one

459
00:29:49,747 --> 00:29:52,958
who knew you were sleeping here
other than the two of us and Butler Joo?

460
00:29:53,042 --> 00:29:53,959
Mr. Ko!

461
00:29:54,043 --> 00:29:57,338
The only being who can be a cat one moment
and a human the next.

462
00:29:57,421 --> 00:29:59,340
- Who is it?
- Mr. Ko!

463
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:01,091
- He's the one!
- He's the one!

464
00:30:01,175 --> 00:30:02,718
He stole the gold bars.

465
00:30:06,263 --> 00:30:07,431
Is someone talking about me?

466
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:10,518
I'm going to get some makgeolli.

467
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:12,019
Bravo.

468
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:17,483
No, it can't be.

469
00:30:18,067 --> 00:30:20,277
Then how will you explain this?

470
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:22,947
Well, that's...

471
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:26,283
Mr. Ko is a spiritual being

472
00:30:26,617 --> 00:30:29,745
who is above all material possessions.

473
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:32,831
He would never be blinded
by some gold bars.

474
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:35,584
We'll see about that.

475
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:40,422
But we don't know for sure
if that cat whisker belongs to him.

476
00:30:41,549 --> 00:30:43,384
Exactly.

477
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:44,969
Let's find out.

478
00:30:54,645 --> 00:30:57,314
Do-sik, can I ask you something?

479
00:30:57,398 --> 00:30:58,816
Of course.

480
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:01,652
What kind of person is Ms. Na?

481
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:02,736
Ms. Na?

482
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:05,781
Well...

483
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:07,199
She's just as she seems.

484
00:31:07,908 --> 00:31:09,994
The only daughter of a wealthy family.

485
00:31:11,287 --> 00:31:13,706
She's the type that always gets her way.

486
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:18,919
Do you know her ideal type by any chance?

487
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,462
Ideal type?

488
00:31:22,131 --> 00:31:23,173
I'm not sure.

489
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:26,969
We've only ever talked about work
so I don't know anything about that.

490
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:28,387
I see.

491
00:31:29,346 --> 00:31:30,389
Why do you ask?

492
00:31:31,015 --> 00:31:32,683
Do you want to set her up with someone?

493
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:35,352
No, I'm just curious.

494
00:31:36,979 --> 00:31:38,814
It seems like she lives

495
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:41,775
in a completely different world than mine.

496
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,237
It's funny I'm comparing myself to her.

497
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:51,869
Just pretend you didn't hear that.

498
00:31:55,289 --> 00:31:56,707
Right.

499
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:59,335
I'm thinking of inviting Ms. Na over soon.

500
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:01,837
You're welcome to join us if you're free.

501
00:32:02,296 --> 00:32:05,424
You're a proper businesswoman now,
aren't you?

502
00:32:05,758 --> 00:32:07,134
You're inviting people over?

503
00:32:08,969 --> 00:32:10,179
That's a good idea.

504
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:12,556
She'll be a great help
once you get to know her.

505
00:32:13,057 --> 00:32:15,225
- Let me know when it's decided.
- Okay.

506
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:24,693
All right.

507
00:32:25,069 --> 00:32:27,154
The ox blood here is good.

508
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:30,407
Gosh, it's so fresh.

509
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:36,497
We're enjoying a meal together
after finding our prime suspect.

510
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,040
It's all great,

511
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,959
but wouldn't it be awkward
if that woman walks in on us?

512
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,961
I'm worried.

513
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:45,297
Why would it be awkward?

514
00:32:45,381 --> 00:32:46,674
This is Woo-hyeol's house.

515
00:32:46,757 --> 00:32:47,716
Right?

516
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,887
Of course!

517
00:32:52,221 --> 00:32:53,514
Make yourselves at home.

518
00:32:53,931 --> 00:32:56,433
Seon Woo-hyeol, you've still got it!

519
00:33:15,369 --> 00:33:16,328
What's going on?

520
00:33:20,374 --> 00:33:21,333
Well...

521
00:33:22,376 --> 00:33:24,420
Meet my friends.

522
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:25,838
Introduce yourselves.

523
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:29,550
Hi, I'm Woo-hyeol's friend, Lee Sang-hae.

524
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:33,345
- Friends?
- I'm Park Dong-seop.

525
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:34,930
What?

526
00:33:35,472 --> 00:33:38,767
Are you from the snack shop
in front of the school?

527
00:33:39,143 --> 00:33:40,436
- You are, right?
- Yes.

528
00:33:42,396 --> 00:33:45,899
Wait, then these people here...

529
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:48,944
No, I mean, these things are...

530
00:33:50,404 --> 00:33:51,447
vampires?

531
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:52,531
These "things"?

532
00:33:53,574 --> 00:33:55,576
They're kind and hard-working.

533
00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:57,953
They don't suck human blood.

534
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:00,372
That's right.
I have a lot of human friends.

535
00:34:00,456 --> 00:34:01,915
I'm pretty outgoing.

536
00:34:01,999 --> 00:34:03,625
My Myers-Briggs Type Indicator is ENFP.

537
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:06,295
- He's the opposite of me.
- I'm an ISTJ.

538
00:34:06,587 --> 00:34:07,796
I'm...

539
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,047
SWH.

540
00:34:09,131 --> 00:34:10,549
Why are you suddenly saying

541
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:11,842
your initials?

542
00:34:11,925 --> 00:34:13,260
You don't know
what Myers-Briggs Type Indicator is?

543
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:15,554
That's not it?

544
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:17,264
It doesn't matter.

545
00:34:17,347 --> 00:34:18,807
Why are you guys all here?

546
00:34:18,891 --> 00:34:22,060
Is there a problem
hanging out at our friend's place?

547
00:34:22,144 --> 00:34:23,020
He's right!

548
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,605
Of course there is!

549
00:34:25,105 --> 00:34:27,608
Woo-hyeol isn't the only one
living in this house.

550
00:34:27,691 --> 00:34:30,444
You can't have random people over
without asking me first!

551
00:34:32,446 --> 00:34:34,323
Are we "random people"?

552
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:35,616
Let's get this straight.

553
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:38,911
We lived in this house
a lot longer than you have!

554
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:41,705
- That's right!
- He's right.

555
00:34:42,456 --> 00:34:43,582
What did you say?

556
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:46,460
On top of waking him up
with a day left until 100 years,

557
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:47,920
you're trying to steal this house?

558
00:34:48,128 --> 00:34:50,881
Your ancestors would be
turning in their graves right now!

559
00:34:50,964 --> 00:34:52,049
Darn you!

560
00:34:55,803 --> 00:34:56,762
Dong-seop.

561
00:34:56,845 --> 00:34:58,806
Let's calm down.

562
00:34:59,473 --> 00:35:00,641
Can we come over from time to time?

563
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:01,892
- No!
- Okay.

564
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:04,978
All right.

565
00:35:05,062 --> 00:35:06,939
I don't know if you heard,

566
00:35:07,022 --> 00:35:09,608
but this place will become a guest house.

567
00:35:09,691 --> 00:35:12,152
So please refrain from visiting
from now on.

568
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:14,822
I don't want this place
to be a vampire hideout.

569
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:17,199
- What?
- What did you...

570
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:19,284
Are we clear? Everyone leave now.

571
00:35:20,077 --> 00:35:21,578
I hope we don't see each other again.

572
00:35:21,662 --> 00:35:23,831
Goodness, I don't believe this.

573
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:25,833
- Listen, Butler Joo!
- What?

574
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:28,001
Do you want to leave with them?

575
00:35:32,256 --> 00:35:33,215
Let's go out.

576
00:35:34,967 --> 00:35:36,593
Hurry up. Let's go.

577
00:35:37,261 --> 00:35:38,720
- Let's eat outside.
- Woo-hyeol.

578
00:35:42,808 --> 00:35:43,642
We're going.

579
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:45,519
I'll see them off.

580
00:36:04,705 --> 00:36:06,456
Having one vampire around is scary enough.

581
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:08,876
But now he has friends?

582
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,885
Who is it?

583
00:36:17,968 --> 00:36:20,470
Butler Joo, may I come in?

584
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:23,724
Give me a second.

585
00:36:36,987 --> 00:36:38,864
Man-hwi, hug me.

586
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:40,657
- All of a sudden?
- Now.

587
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:48,123
Not like that. Hold me more tightly.

588
00:36:50,459 --> 00:36:52,628
People are looking. What's with you?

589
00:37:10,771 --> 00:37:12,272
It's not the same.

590
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:13,482
As what?

591
00:37:15,192 --> 00:37:17,235
I went to Gongcheon-dong the other day.

592
00:37:18,028 --> 00:37:20,822
A man saw me in front of the mansion

593
00:37:21,198 --> 00:37:22,574
and hugged me right away.

594
00:37:22,783 --> 00:37:25,118
What a lunatic. So what happened?

595
00:37:26,036 --> 00:37:28,789
I tried to recall where I saw him,

596
00:37:29,373 --> 00:37:30,916
but I couldn't.

597
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:32,209
But...

598
00:37:33,043 --> 00:37:35,921
strangely enough, he's been on my mind.

599
00:37:38,215 --> 00:37:40,842
He must be good-looking.

600
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:42,719
He is.

601
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,056
But the look in his eyes...

602
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:48,767
It's hard to explain.

603
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:52,813
But there was something about it.

604
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,272
What's going on?

605
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:57,734
You seem hung up on him.

606
00:37:57,818 --> 00:38:00,320
He lives in that mansion.

607
00:38:00,946 --> 00:38:02,197
Talk about coincidence.

608
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:11,915
How could you lure other vampires here
the moment I went away?

609
00:38:14,084 --> 00:38:15,627
What do you mean "lure"?

610
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:18,547
We were just reminiscing
about our good old days

611
00:38:19,006 --> 00:38:20,674
in this mansion.

612
00:38:20,757 --> 00:38:22,092
Goodness.

613
00:38:22,509 --> 00:38:24,344
I'm sorry. Don't be angry.

614
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:30,934
Anyway, how did it go today?

615
00:38:31,018 --> 00:38:32,102
What do you mean?

616
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:33,562
With Do-sik.

617
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:34,521
What?

618
00:38:35,147 --> 00:38:36,189
What about him...

619
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:37,941
- Right.
- Yes.

620
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:40,193
Things are pretty much ready.

621
00:38:40,694 --> 00:38:43,196
I'm going to invite him this weekend.
Is that okay?

622
00:38:44,156 --> 00:38:45,157
Well...

623
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,536
Will Hae-sun...

624
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:52,330
No, I mean...

625
00:38:52,414 --> 00:38:54,249
Will Ms. Na be here too?

626
00:38:54,458 --> 00:38:56,543
I was going to give her a call.

627
00:38:56,626 --> 00:38:58,170
Should I call her now?

628
00:39:00,297 --> 00:39:01,256
Yes.

629
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:04,968
It weighed on my mind
that you had to leave like that last time.

630
00:39:05,177 --> 00:39:06,803
I'd like to invite you over
on the weekend.

631
00:39:06,887 --> 00:39:08,555
Will you be available?

632
00:39:09,139 --> 00:39:11,433
That sounds great. I'm free this weekend.

633
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:13,810
How does Saturday afternoon sound?

634
00:39:15,771 --> 00:39:16,605
Sounds good.

635
00:39:17,314 --> 00:39:18,440
I'm excited.

636
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:19,608
I'll see you Saturday.

637
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:21,109
I'll see you then.

638
00:39:27,074 --> 00:39:27,991
Sorry.

639
00:39:30,911 --> 00:39:32,287
Is Saturday afternoon okay?

640
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,331
Yes.

641
00:39:34,414 --> 00:39:37,000
This is your chance, so good luck.

642
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:40,712
All right.

643
00:39:44,466 --> 00:39:47,469
First, do not speak of Hae-sun.

644
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:48,804
Repeat after me.

645
00:39:51,348 --> 00:39:53,475
"Do not speak of Hae-sun."

646
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:55,602
If you're going to call her,
call her Ms. Na.

647
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,357
I can't call Hae-sun by her name?

648
00:40:00,816 --> 00:40:02,234
That's ridiculous.

649
00:40:02,526 --> 00:40:05,362
Second, do not make
abrupt physical contact with her.

650
00:40:05,445 --> 00:40:08,323
"Do not make
abrupt physical contact with her."

651
00:40:09,282 --> 00:40:10,283
But...

652
00:40:11,076 --> 00:40:12,077
what do you mean by physical contact?

653
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,996
What I'm saying is, you can't hug her
out of the blue like last time.

654
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:16,248
I see.

655
00:40:16,665 --> 00:40:19,417
Also, don't make her uncomfortable
by looking at her.

656
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:22,504
It's rude to stare at someone.

657
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:24,589
- It makes them uncomfortable.
- Come on.

658
00:40:25,215 --> 00:40:26,591
I can't even call her by her name,

659
00:40:26,675 --> 00:40:28,343
hug her, or look at her.

660
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:30,178
Isn't that too harsh?

661
00:40:30,262 --> 00:40:32,222
If possible, don't do anything.

662
00:40:32,556 --> 00:40:35,308
It's in your best interest
to keep your mouth closed.

663
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,733
Finally, and this is the most important.

664
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:46,945
Be careful not to
expose yourself as a vampire.

665
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:51,700
"Be careful not to
expose myself as a vampire."

666
00:40:52,284 --> 00:40:53,743
That's a given.

667
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:57,706
You can't do anything
that would give yourself away, okay?

668
00:40:57,789 --> 00:40:59,332
You took the words out of my mouth.

669
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:01,501
That's it.

670
00:41:02,169 --> 00:41:03,211
How do you feel?

671
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:05,630
You seem a little nervous.

672
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:08,758
Nervous, my foot.

673
00:41:09,885 --> 00:41:10,760
I'm not.

674
00:41:11,303 --> 00:41:12,804
I think you are.

675
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:14,973
Is your heart racing with excitement?

676
00:41:19,728 --> 00:41:20,979
I don't know how that feels.

677
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:24,733
I don't know how it feels
to have my heart race.

678
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:29,821
I've never felt it once.

679
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,116
If that's the case,

680
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:36,745
then how did you wait for her
for such a long time

681
00:41:37,871 --> 00:41:41,208
when you don't even know
what it's like to have your heart race?

682
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,172
Are you stupid?

683
00:41:47,964 --> 00:41:51,009
Thinking about and waiting for
one person for a long time.

684
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:52,510
That's love.

685
00:41:54,262 --> 00:41:57,724
A racing heart and excitement
aren't the only signs of love.

686
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:04,981
Anyway, don't forget
what I told you today.

687
00:42:05,065 --> 00:42:07,734
One mistake can blow everything
including the investment.

688
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:10,195
- Okay?
- Okay.

689
00:42:11,029 --> 00:42:12,030
Butler Joo.

690
00:42:14,658 --> 00:42:16,868
Thank you for looking out for me.

691
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:33,343
REFRESH REAL ESTATE CONSULTING
DEVELOPMENT PROGRESS

692
00:42:35,345 --> 00:42:37,847
How is the preparation
for the guest house going?

693
00:42:38,098 --> 00:42:39,224
It's going well.

694
00:42:39,307 --> 00:42:40,684
We'll keep most of the structure

695
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:43,144
and only fix up the old facilities.

696
00:42:46,398 --> 00:42:48,108
You seem to care about her a lot.

697
00:42:48,692 --> 00:42:49,651
Sorry?

698
00:42:52,112 --> 00:42:53,154
I'm talking about In-hae.

699
00:42:55,115 --> 00:42:56,574
I tend to catch on quickly.

700
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:00,245
She's my dear friend.

701
00:43:00,537 --> 00:43:03,748
And since you're interested
in this project, I should do my best.

702
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:06,584
My expectations are high.

703
00:43:07,002 --> 00:43:07,836
Right.

704
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:09,713
In-hae invited you over
this weekend, right?

705
00:43:09,796 --> 00:43:10,672
Yes.

706
00:43:11,381 --> 00:43:13,341
I'm so curious about the interior.

707
00:43:15,468 --> 00:43:16,761
Honestly, I was quite surprised

708
00:43:16,845 --> 00:43:20,348
when you said you wanted to invest
in the guest house.

709
00:43:21,224 --> 00:43:24,394
I thought you were
only interested in purchasing it.

710
00:43:26,813 --> 00:43:29,316
People tell you to forget
things that you can't have.

711
00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:31,609
But I have a good memory.

712
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:48,793
Are you stupid?

713
00:43:49,711 --> 00:43:52,964
Thinking about and waiting for
one person for a long time.

714
00:43:53,381 --> 00:43:54,632
That's love.

715
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:58,887
A racing heart and excitement
aren't the only signs of love.

716
00:44:43,056 --> 00:44:44,599
Doesn't it look like a star in bloom?

717
00:44:48,937 --> 00:44:50,063
It's beautiful.

718
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:23,012
Goodness.

719
00:45:57,881 --> 00:45:58,840
Hey.

720
00:46:04,971 --> 00:46:05,972
What?

721
00:46:06,055 --> 00:46:07,640
Nothing.

722
00:46:10,185 --> 00:46:11,394
Hold on.

723
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:22,197
All done.

724
00:46:26,743 --> 00:46:27,660
Thanks.

725
00:46:31,915 --> 00:46:34,250
Fine, I'll make an exception today.

726
00:46:34,709 --> 00:46:36,085
Look at yourself all you want.

727
00:46:41,508 --> 00:46:42,634
So?

728
00:46:42,717 --> 00:46:44,177
What do you think?

729
00:46:48,515 --> 00:46:49,516
Beautiful.

730
00:46:50,433 --> 00:46:51,476
Your eyes.

731
00:47:00,151 --> 00:47:01,653
They must be here.

732
00:47:01,736 --> 00:47:02,570
Right.

733
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,118
Hello.

734
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:11,079
I'm finally here.

735
00:47:11,371 --> 00:47:12,580
Thank you for inviting me.

736
00:47:12,664 --> 00:47:14,666
Please. Thank you for coming.

737
00:47:14,916 --> 00:47:16,459
- Come on in.
- Let's go in.

738
00:47:36,354 --> 00:47:37,397
Welcome.

739
00:47:39,816 --> 00:47:41,276
Is this for me?

740
00:47:44,571 --> 00:47:46,614
It's gorgeous.

741
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:52,870
I apologize for the other day.

742
00:47:54,247 --> 00:47:55,290
What about me?

743
00:47:57,667 --> 00:47:59,419
You've been here before.

744
00:48:00,295 --> 00:48:01,546
You're asking for too much.

745
00:48:04,299 --> 00:48:06,259
You should show Ms. Na around the house.

746
00:48:06,509 --> 00:48:08,219
Sure. Gladly.

747
00:48:12,849 --> 00:48:13,933
I brought a gift.

748
00:48:14,017 --> 00:48:15,184
Thank you.

749
00:48:15,268 --> 00:48:16,436
Let me take your jacket.

750
00:48:16,519 --> 00:48:17,812
Thank you.

751
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:20,106
This way.

752
00:48:24,235 --> 00:48:25,403
- Come here.
- Okay.

753
00:48:31,701 --> 00:48:33,119
How do you feel to be in here?

754
00:48:34,579 --> 00:48:36,789
The house looks gorgeous from the outside,

755
00:48:37,123 --> 00:48:38,499
but it's much more so on the inside.

756
00:48:40,126 --> 00:48:41,836
Do you have to renovate the place?

757
00:48:42,795 --> 00:48:44,589
I think it's better to keep it this way.

758
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:49,093
We're on the same page.

759
00:48:51,471 --> 00:48:53,348
It's a pity those ignorant human beings

760
00:48:53,598 --> 00:48:55,141
keep attempting to change everything.

761
00:48:56,392 --> 00:48:57,852
Let's go. I'll give you a hand.

762
00:49:02,482 --> 00:49:05,068
I saw that the mansion
is under Ms. Joo's name.

763
00:49:05,485 --> 00:49:07,153
How did you end up living with her?

764
00:49:08,446 --> 00:49:09,572
Well...

765
00:49:09,781 --> 00:49:12,742
It's a very long story.

766
00:49:14,827 --> 00:49:18,498
Simply put, I used to know her ancestor...

767
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:20,583
I mean,

768
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:24,295
I guess you could say
our families are acquainted.

769
00:49:24,629 --> 00:49:26,923
In that case,

770
00:49:28,174 --> 00:49:30,760
has it been arranged
that you marry her or something?

771
00:49:32,053 --> 00:49:33,721
What a terrifying thing to say.

772
00:49:33,805 --> 00:49:35,431
That isn't the case at all.

773
00:49:47,276 --> 00:49:48,236
What is it?

774
00:49:49,737 --> 00:49:51,114
Why are you looking at me like that?

775
00:49:53,366 --> 00:49:54,367
It's nothing.

776
00:49:55,076 --> 00:49:56,077
This way.

777
00:50:02,417 --> 00:50:03,835
I'll set the table.

778
00:50:04,168 --> 00:50:07,213
It's okay, I'll do it. Go take a seat.

779
00:50:07,547 --> 00:50:10,633
As Mr. Seon said,
you don't have to treat me like a guest.

780
00:50:11,509 --> 00:50:13,052
Relax, it's fine.

781
00:50:18,558 --> 00:50:20,810
It looks like
you prepared quite a lot for today.

782
00:50:22,061 --> 00:50:23,104
It's nothing.

783
00:50:23,438 --> 00:50:26,065
The kitchen here is not fit to cook,

784
00:50:26,357 --> 00:50:28,025
so I had everything ordered in.

785
00:50:30,278 --> 00:50:32,405
I'm sure we'll enjoy it.

786
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:33,740
Let's get ready.

787
00:50:33,823 --> 00:50:34,657
Okay.

788
00:50:40,371 --> 00:50:42,707
It's not much, but please enjoy.

789
00:50:42,915 --> 00:50:43,875
Thank you.

790
00:50:45,251 --> 00:50:46,544
It has a nice aroma.

791
00:50:47,879 --> 00:50:49,172
It looks expensive.

792
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:50,339
Of course.

793
00:50:50,715 --> 00:50:53,134
Expensive wines
are for occasions like this.

794
00:50:54,302 --> 00:50:56,179
Mr. Shin, please pour everyone a glass.

795
00:50:56,262 --> 00:50:57,221
Sure.

796
00:51:07,523 --> 00:51:10,109
Woo-hyeol can't drink.

797
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:11,778
Really?

798
00:51:11,861 --> 00:51:13,321
That's a shame.

799
00:51:13,404 --> 00:51:16,866
I've been saving this one
to drink with the people I like.

800
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,493
Then...

801
00:51:19,535 --> 00:51:20,411
I'll have a glass.

802
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:28,252
I wish I could,

803
00:51:29,045 --> 00:51:33,174
but I get drunk
just by walking past a wheat field.

804
00:51:33,716 --> 00:51:35,051
I'm basically a teetotaler.

805
00:51:36,302 --> 00:51:37,762
A teetotaler?

806
00:51:39,555 --> 00:51:41,057
How do you even know that word?

807
00:51:41,432 --> 00:51:44,852
Well, I'm quite old-fashioned.

808
00:51:48,064 --> 00:51:49,941
I'll pour you one anyway.

809
00:51:50,024 --> 00:51:51,317
You don't have to drink it though.

810
00:51:52,985 --> 00:51:53,903
All right.

811
00:52:05,206 --> 00:52:06,582
Shall we?

812
00:52:27,311 --> 00:52:29,063
Mr. Seon, why aren't you eating anything?

813
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:30,731
Aren't you hungry?

814
00:52:31,023 --> 00:52:31,941
Right.

815
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:34,485
Are you okay?

816
00:52:35,695 --> 00:52:36,696
Are you okay?

817
00:52:38,197 --> 00:52:39,240
I'm okay.

818
00:52:41,117 --> 00:52:42,577
You should eat something.

819
00:52:42,827 --> 00:52:45,162
You haven't even touched anything.

820
00:52:46,122 --> 00:52:48,291
Right.

821
00:52:48,374 --> 00:52:49,959
You didn't think I was watching, right?

822
00:52:50,668 --> 00:52:51,878
I'm keeping my eye on you.

823
00:52:59,468 --> 00:53:00,428
Here.

824
00:53:01,387 --> 00:53:04,056
People don't peel shrimp for just anyone.

825
00:53:06,475 --> 00:53:08,269
That shrimp...

826
00:53:10,521 --> 00:53:12,398
Is it okay if I eat it?

827
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:14,191
Sorry?

828
00:53:17,153 --> 00:53:18,654
I just love

829
00:53:19,614 --> 00:53:21,157
shrimp so much.

830
00:53:21,616 --> 00:53:22,825
I'll eat it.

831
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:25,578
In-hae, let me peel one for you.

832
00:53:25,661 --> 00:53:26,954
No, there's no need.

833
00:53:27,371 --> 00:53:28,331
Look at you.

834
00:53:28,414 --> 00:53:30,458
I've never seen this side of you.

835
00:53:31,292 --> 00:53:32,418
Sorry?

836
00:53:32,501 --> 00:53:34,253
Nothing. You're so sweet.

837
00:53:35,963 --> 00:53:38,883
Mr. Seon, eat it quickly
before she takes it.

838
00:54:04,408 --> 00:54:07,411
I've never eaten anything so chewy before.

839
00:54:13,084 --> 00:54:14,502
It's as if the sea is in my mouth.

840
00:54:15,211 --> 00:54:17,004
So this is what shrimp tastes like?

841
00:54:19,715 --> 00:54:21,092
Are you okay?

842
00:54:21,634 --> 00:54:23,761
I've never had something
so delicious before.

843
00:54:27,306 --> 00:54:28,391
In-hae, here.

844
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:33,604
Is it okay if I eat this?

845
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:36,607
What's with you? It's mine.

846
00:54:38,609 --> 00:54:39,568
It's mine.

847
00:54:42,863 --> 00:54:43,990
You can have it.

848
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:55,584
So this is shrimp?

849
00:55:02,258 --> 00:55:04,093
You really love shrimp, don't you?

850
00:55:09,807 --> 00:55:11,434
In-hae, are you feeling ill?

851
00:55:12,435 --> 00:55:13,728
Sorry?

852
00:55:15,146 --> 00:55:16,022
No.

853
00:55:24,864 --> 00:55:26,073
I need some air.

854
00:55:26,824 --> 00:55:28,075
He seems pretty drunk.

855
00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:31,245
He gets drunk just by smelling alcohol.

856
00:55:43,382 --> 00:55:44,300
Hae-sun.

857
00:55:45,801 --> 00:55:46,844
I...

858
00:55:46,927 --> 00:55:48,971
- What's with you, Woo-hyeol?
- Do you know how much...

859
00:55:49,055 --> 00:55:50,723
I'm sorry. Please excuse us.

860
00:55:50,806 --> 00:55:52,850
- To meet you again...
- He seems drunk.

861
00:55:53,893 --> 00:55:57,021
- I wanted to experience love that...
- Why did you drink so much?

862
00:55:57,772 --> 00:55:58,689
I really...

863
00:56:00,608 --> 00:56:02,651
Try to sober up.

864
00:56:02,735 --> 00:56:05,613
- Please get a hold of yourself.
- Shrimp.

865
00:56:05,696 --> 00:56:07,907
- Hold on!
- Wake up.

866
00:56:08,824 --> 00:56:11,118
- Hae-sun is going to give me shrimp.
- No, you can't.

867
00:56:11,202 --> 00:56:12,912
- You can't go inside.
- Hae-sun is going to...

868
00:56:12,995 --> 00:56:15,164
Can you please be quiet?

869
00:56:15,247 --> 00:56:16,499
- The shrimp!
- I'm not doing this

870
00:56:16,582 --> 00:56:17,792
because I hate you, okay?

871
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:19,251
I'm going to hit you just once.

872
00:56:19,335 --> 00:56:20,294
I'm sorry!

873
00:56:28,761 --> 00:56:29,845
Did that wake you up?

874
00:56:33,099 --> 00:56:34,141
Butler Joo.

875
00:56:37,228 --> 00:56:38,729
Look at me, Woo-hyeol.

876
00:56:39,063 --> 00:56:40,689
Did you forget the promise we made?

877
00:56:41,023 --> 00:56:43,692
Why would you eat so much
when you get drunk off of just noodles?

878
00:57:01,836 --> 00:57:02,837
Hey.

879
00:57:03,963 --> 00:57:05,172
Woo-hyeol.

880
00:57:08,884 --> 00:57:10,010
Are you okay?

881
00:57:11,095 --> 00:57:14,140
Let me stay like this for a moment.

882
00:57:35,035 --> 00:57:36,245
Will they be okay?

883
00:57:36,787 --> 00:57:38,289
I've never seen anyone so drunk before.

884
00:57:40,624 --> 00:57:41,542
Cheers.

885
00:57:49,216 --> 00:57:50,426
It was a good idea to come today.

886
00:57:50,759 --> 00:57:51,677
It was.

887
00:57:52,011 --> 00:57:53,512
I saw a new side of you.

888
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:58,309
And I got to know someone interesting.

889
00:57:58,934 --> 00:58:00,060
It's fun.

890
00:58:00,561 --> 00:58:01,520
Tell me about it.

891
00:58:04,899 --> 00:58:07,234
I love it here.

892
00:58:14,533 --> 00:58:16,827
It's work. Please excuse me.

893
00:58:19,371 --> 00:58:20,456
Hello, sir.

894
00:58:22,958 --> 00:58:24,877
Hey, Woo-hyeol.

895
00:58:25,461 --> 00:58:27,796
Sober up and get up now.

896
00:58:28,255 --> 00:58:30,257
They're waiting for us inside.

897
00:58:32,968 --> 00:58:34,053
Woo-hyeol.

898
00:58:53,614 --> 00:58:54,782
Butler Joo.

899
00:58:58,827 --> 00:58:59,870
I'm sorry.

900
00:59:01,497 --> 00:59:04,041
I made a mistake.

901
00:59:08,504 --> 00:59:09,672
I'll go in first.

902
00:59:37,741 --> 00:59:38,867
Yes, sir.

903
00:59:40,619 --> 00:59:41,578
Yes.

904
00:59:42,329 --> 00:59:43,664
Yes, it takes about that long.

905
00:59:43,747 --> 00:59:45,833
The construction takes about two weeks.

906
01:00:49,146 --> 01:00:52,024
HEARTBEAT

907
01:00:52,316 --> 01:00:53,942
Did you get the gift I sent?

908
01:00:54,026 --> 01:00:55,527
I had a car since 100 years ago,

909
01:00:55,611 --> 01:00:57,237
but it was Butler Joo who drove it.

910
01:00:57,321 --> 01:00:58,614
- Signal a right turn.
- Right.

911
01:00:59,531 --> 01:01:01,867
I have a date with a handsome lunatic.

912
01:01:01,950 --> 01:01:02,868
Hae-sun.

913
01:01:02,951 --> 01:01:04,411
All you talk about is Hae-sun!

914
01:01:04,495 --> 01:01:06,497
Hae-sun...

915
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:08,749
If you keep it up,
I'll have no one to hang out with.

916
01:01:09,917 --> 01:01:11,627
I saw it with my own two eyes.

917
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:12,878
He's not human.

918
01:01:12,961 --> 01:01:14,213
- Mr. Ko?
- Mr. Ko?

919
01:01:14,296 --> 01:01:17,007
He's living the most crucial but also
the most dangerous time of his life.

920
01:01:17,091 --> 01:01:18,217
These little...

921
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:19,802
He needs your help.

922
01:01:20,094 --> 01:01:22,054
I couldn't ask you out after that.

923
01:01:22,137 --> 01:01:24,223
You will never get to see the moon again.

924
