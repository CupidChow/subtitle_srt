HEARTBEAT

00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,298
ALL CHARACTERS, NAMES,
ORGANIZATIONS, GROUPS, EVENTS,

3
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,383
AND SETTINGS ARE FICTITIOUS
AND ANIMAL SAFETY GUIDELINES WERE FOLLOWED

4
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:22,833
Woo-hyeol,

5
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:24,293
are you okay?

6
00:01:29,298 --> 00:01:32,051
Were you here all night?

7
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:35,221
There was nothing I could do

8
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:36,972
except stay by your side.

9
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,684
I know what to do when people are sick,

10
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:44,855
but I have no idea what to do
when you're sick.

11
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:49,819
I got scared

12
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:53,531
that something might happen to you.

13
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:56,200
I was scared

14
00:01:57,076 --> 00:02:00,663
that I might not be
able to see you again...

15
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:04,959
like my mom and dad.

16
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:10,047
I want you

17
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:12,591
to stay by my side for a long time

18
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:16,595
and never go anywhere.

19
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:20,182
I think I'd be devastated

20
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,435
if you weren't in this world.

21
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:29,066
I know there's only one person

22
00:02:29,525 --> 00:02:31,694
in your heart.

23
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:34,154
But even then,

24
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:35,656
I think

25
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,784
I should tell you

26
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:41,996
because I've never felt like this before.

27
00:02:45,249 --> 00:02:46,792
I think...

28
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:54,925
I have feelings for you, Woo-hyeol.

29
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:36,425
It almost feels like my heart is beating.

30
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:42,973
Don't worry.

31
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:44,975
I won't go anywhere

32
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:46,560
and stay by your side

33
00:03:47,645 --> 00:03:49,146
for a long time.

HEARTBEAT
EPISODE 12

35
00:04:38,404 --> 00:04:40,072
Why is my heart beating so fast?

36
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:43,575
I might die at this rate.

37
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:02,553
How peculiar.

38
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:04,888
Why did I do that?

39
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:19,153
And why can't I stop grinning?

40
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:43,385
I heard you were looking
for a half-vampire.

41
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:47,556
So you're saying you're a vampire

42
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:50,392
and you can help me find

43
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:52,311
a half-vampire?

44
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:56,398
No wonder you grew a successful business.

45
00:05:58,317 --> 00:05:59,443
I find it odd

46
00:06:00,486 --> 00:06:02,780
that a vampire would help a human.

47
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:06,950
Human or vampire.
What difference does that make?

48
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:08,118
All I value is money.

49
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:11,038
But why are you searching
for a half-vampire?

50
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:12,664
Is that important?

51
00:06:13,332 --> 00:06:14,416
All you value is money.

52
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,170
You're my kind of man.

53
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:23,425
I look forward to our partnership.

54
00:07:01,547 --> 00:07:03,048
Did something happen last night?

55
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,299
Sorry?

56
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:05,884
No.

57
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:08,095
Absolutely nothing happened.

58
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:10,389
I heard you pacing up and down
until late last night.

59
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:12,641
I didn't do that.

60
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:13,767
Okay then.

61
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:18,897
It's not like you
to have makeup on in the morning.

62
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:19,857
What?

63
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,441
No, I didn't put any makeup on.

64
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:23,360
Who are you trying to fool?

65
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,237
You did.

66
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,615
Don't be ridiculous.
I don't have any makeup on.

67
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:32,202
You're practically in full makeup
if you put on lipstick and blush.

68
00:07:32,578 --> 00:07:33,787
Why are you denying it?

69
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:42,337
I'm going for a jog to loosen up a bit.

70
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:43,505
- Okay.
- Sure.

71
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:46,717
Be safe out there.

72
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:05,110
Did you get some rest?

73
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:08,155
You must've been tired
from looking after me all night.

74
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:12,951
Yes, I slept really well
for the first time in a while.

75
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:19,208
You look pretty.

76
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,005
How are you feeling?

77
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:29,134
Thanks to you, I'm as good as new.

78
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:33,430
Things would've been bad last night
had it not been for your friends.

79
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:36,141
Give them a call later.
They must be worried.

80
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,184
I will.

81
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:38,518
Also,

82
00:08:38,602 --> 00:08:41,480
I forgot to ask you last night
with everything going on.

83
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:46,026
But what happened with Ms. Na?

84
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:49,321
Oh, that.

85
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,615
I'm not interrogating you or anything.

86
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:54,493
I just don't want to get the wrong idea.

87
00:08:55,786 --> 00:08:56,787
I'm sorry.

88
00:08:57,496 --> 00:09:00,290
But something did happen.

89
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,543
Can I ask what it was?

90
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,006
The scroll I had lost

91
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:11,218
was with her.

92
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:12,761
What?

93
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:20,644
It's nothing more...

94
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:23,063
than a drawing.

95
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:25,649
The person I'm waiting for

96
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:28,443
is the one who taught me
what it's like to be loved

97
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:32,239
and made me dream of love
that makes my heart beat,

98
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:35,534
not someone who simply looks like Hae-sun.

99
00:09:37,703 --> 00:09:38,996
This woman...

100
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,415
is me.

101
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:51,216
How is that possible?

102
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:55,304
I don't know how the scroll
ended up in her hands,

103
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:56,847
but I know one thing for sure.

104
00:09:57,681 --> 00:09:59,599
The Ms. Na I saw yesterday

105
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:03,520
was nothing like the Hae-sun I know.

106
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:08,275
I felt lost.

107
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:11,528
Just like I was
when I woke up after 100 years.

108
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,954
I didn't know where to go.

109
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:27,252
But that's when you found me.

110
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:28,754
Woo-hyeol!

111
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:32,132
When you called out for me,

112
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:35,886
it felt like I was being rescued

113
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:38,722
from a dark pit.

114
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,103
I was elated and relieved to see you.

115
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:50,609
Knowing that someone was waiting for me

116
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:52,110
and the fact

117
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,321
that it was you

118
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,240
overwhelmed me.

119
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,877
Thank you for being by my side.

120
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:28,146
Woo-hyeol!

121
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,690
- Woo-hyeol!
- My goodness!

122
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:32,526
- Woo-hyeol.
- Are you all right?

123
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,112
Guys.

124
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:38,198
Get off me, you brats!

125
00:11:38,407 --> 00:11:40,075
Please calm down.

126
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:41,660
What brings you by in the morning?

127
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:44,454
What do you mean? We came
because we were worried about you.

128
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:46,123
- He looks fine.
- Right.

129
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,708
I needed to see you with my own eyes
to be certain.

130
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,962
I was so shocked yesterday
that I couldn't get a wink of sleep.

131
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:54,131
Right. I'm sorry about that. Now leave.

132
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:55,549
- That being said...
- Yes?

133
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,217
Take a seat.

134
00:11:57,926 --> 00:11:59,761
- Should I say it?
- Go ahead.

135
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:02,848
Well, we have something to tell you.

136
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,689
You want to live and work here?

137
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:11,857
Yes.

138
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,775
That's out of the blue.

139
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:16,862
Who knows

140
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:18,989
when you'll collapse again?

141
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:21,366
It's best that we stay close.

142
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:22,284
Wouldn't that...

143
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:24,077
- We'd be more at ease.
- Right.

144
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:26,538
What would you have done
if not for us yesterday?

145
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:30,000
You do have a point.

146
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:34,796
But a guest house

147
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,924
with more vampires than humans?

148
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:43,096
We're low on guests,
so I can't pay you right now.

149
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:49,811
Is there really no way
for us to live here?

150
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:55,567
All right then.

151
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,278
Woo-hyeol isn't in the best condition,

152
00:12:58,487 --> 00:13:00,822
and the basement is his space,

153
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:02,240
so I won't stop you from moving in.

154
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:03,325
Okay.

155
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:06,369
But I'll dock the rent from your pay.

156
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:09,623
- Of course. Go ahead.
- Sure thing.

157
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:12,542
- We have a conscience, you know.
- We sure do.

158
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:16,338
Thanks, Butler Joo.

159
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:23,720
- She's no pushover, is she?
- I know. She's young, but she's scary.

160
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:25,680
Docking the rent from our pay?

161
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:28,141
- I almost showed my fangs.
- I'm proud you held back.

162
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:29,643
I barely managed to.

163
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:30,685
You two.

164
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,521
We need to talk.

165
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,065
Follow me.

166
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:48,787
How could you do this without telling--

167
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,038
We're sorry, Woo-hyeol.

168
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:52,707
But even if you didn't approve,

169
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:54,543
we were going to insist.

170
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,628
A vampire losing consciousness

171
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:59,005
isn't something to take lightly.

172
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:02,634
But Woo-hyeol,

173
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:04,803
can you get blood filled with love
anytime soon?

174
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,142
There's something

175
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,645
I must tell you.

176
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:14,771
What is it?

177
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:15,939
I think

178
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:18,400
Butler Joo is in love.

179
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:21,653
Really?

180
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:23,947
Does this mean you'll become human now?

181
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,115
That's right.

182
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:27,867
Congratulations, Woo-hyeol!

183
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:30,912
You finally made it happen! Great job!

184
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:32,622
- Guys, hold on.
- Wait.

185
00:14:32,998 --> 00:14:36,835
Shouldn't we have a small party
before the big day comes?

186
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:39,212
Since when did we love parties so much?

187
00:14:39,296 --> 00:14:40,755
I'm getting tired of them.

188
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:42,841
He's finally becoming human!

189
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:44,384
We need to celebrate it properly!

190
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:48,638
But it's me.

191
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:50,515
- Yes!
- Woo-hyeol!

192
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:55,186
What is?

193
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:58,648
The one Butler Joo is in love with.

194
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:00,859
It's me.

195
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:02,277
What?

196
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:04,446
She has feelings for me.

197
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:06,781
My gosh.

198
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:09,701
Goodness.

199
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:11,328
Are you okay?

200
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:12,621
Damn it.

201
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:27,969
REFRESH REAL ESTATE CONSULTING

202
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:29,262
Mr. Shin.

203
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:33,475
Lee Man-hwi

204
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:35,935
is the man in the video.

205
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:37,729
And he seems to know Seon Woo-hyeol.

206
00:15:40,065 --> 00:15:41,524
I don't have a good feeling about him.

207
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:45,528
He must've approached me
after eavesdropping on our conversation.

208
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,948
And it seems he'll do anything for money.

209
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,450
I'll keep tabs on him.

210
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:54,245
He does seem dangerous
but could be of use while on a leash.

211
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,915
Money seems to be his objective,

212
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:59,376
so let's approach it as a business deal.

213
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:00,835
Yes, sir.

214
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:12,055
Do you have time to talk?

215
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:23,316
I appreciate the advice you gave me.

216
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:24,943
It got me thinking.

217
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:28,530
But I was left wondering.

218
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:30,824
It's about the mansion.

219
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,869
Do you know how it is?

220
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:36,204
I'm not sure.

221
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:38,456
I don't know the exact number,

222
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,500
but it's at least over a century old.

223
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:43,753
Why do you ask? Is there an issue?

224
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:45,839
What if

225
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:48,508
someone older than the mansion
is currently living there?

226
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,930
I'll ask you point-blank.

227
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:56,766
Do you know what Seon Woo-hyeol is?

228
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:03,940
I don't know how to answer that.

229
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:06,776
You won't believe what I say.

230
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,027
I must know for sure.

231
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:10,655
I must know what Seon Woo-hyeol is,

232
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:13,908
why he hasn't aged or died for centuries,

233
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:18,329
and why he's living with Joo In-hae
like it's the natural order of things.

234
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:21,875
If you know anything, please tell me.

235
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:28,548
Would you believe me if I said

236
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:30,383
he was a vampire?

237
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:34,429
A vampire?

238
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,946
The woman in the scroll
who looks just like you

239
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:53,656
is Seon Woo-hyeol's first love.

240
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:57,535
She's the reason
why he wants to become human.

241
00:17:57,619 --> 00:17:58,495
Hae-sun.

242
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:01,664
You found me just as you promised.

243
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,125
The look in his eyes...

244
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:06,044
It's hard to explain.

245
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:09,547
But there was something about it.

246
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:12,050
Mr. Seon, why aren't you eating anything?

247
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,468
Aren't you hungry?

248
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:15,970
Then what does that make you

249
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:18,056
who has waited for this woman
for centuries?

250
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:21,893
There isn't a better place
to wait for someone.

251
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:23,812
Here, you can long for that person

252
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:26,981
without realizing that time is passing by.

253
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:28,858
Do you paint?

254
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:30,151
In my younger years,

255
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,529
I was told I was gifted.

256
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:34,656
Bees and butterflies

257
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:37,617
would gently rest on my paintings.

258
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,702
Please...

259
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:42,831
wait just a little longer.

260
00:18:44,249 --> 00:18:45,708
I have something I must sort out.

261
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:01,808
Oh.

262
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:05,019
Hello, what brings you by?

263
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:08,690
I have to make my way to a funeral.

264
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:11,025
- And?
- And there's no one to babysit.

265
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:13,403
- Sorry?
- Min-jae, come here.

266
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:16,823
Gi-suk at the butcher shop

267
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:18,950
is at the hospital for a checkup.

268
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:20,910
I'm sorry to ask,

269
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:23,371
but could you look after him for a while?

270
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,582
Well, the thing is...

271
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:30,086
But this is a guest house,
not a daycare center.

272
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,296
You can't just--

273
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:33,882
Right, I'm well aware of that.

274
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:35,758
But kids can also be guests.

275
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:38,845
There's no one else to watch over him.
Please help me out this once.

276
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:42,223
But this is way too sudden.

277
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:43,600
Hold on.

278
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:48,229
- Here you go.
- What...

279
00:19:48,313 --> 00:19:49,314
- But...
- Min-jae, come this way.

280
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:51,566
I'll pick him up in the evening.

281
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:54,569
It may not seem that way,
but he isn't a bother at all.

282
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:57,447
Even at home, he's a complete bookworm.

283
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:02,410
Min-jae, you need to behave well, okay?
I'll be back soon.

284
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:03,494
- Okay.
- All right.

285
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:06,664
I'll owe you big time.

286
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:11,085
Min-jae, have fun with In-hae.
I'll be right back.

287
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:12,086
- All right.
- Okay?

288
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:14,213
- I'll get you jellies on my way back.
- Okay.

289
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:16,007
Thanks for this.

290
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:17,634
Mr. Kim, wait!

291
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:19,093
Mr. Kim!

292
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,653
Do you accept kids as guests?

293
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:40,615
Do we accept kids as guests?

294
00:20:52,502 --> 00:20:53,544
Right.

295
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:56,798
I think it was this house.

296
00:20:59,634 --> 00:21:00,510
What?

297
00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:02,595
What the...

298
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:04,889
Man-hwi?

299
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:21,656
Min-jae...

300
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:24,117
Are you hungry?

301
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,120
Then...

302
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:29,622
These guys behind me...

303
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:31,582
These uncles...

304
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:35,837
Would you like to play ball
with these men?

305
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,590
I heard you were a bookworm,

306
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:41,509
but there isn't anything here
for you to read.

307
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:42,593
Oh, right.

308
00:21:42,844 --> 00:21:44,429
How about we watch some videos together?

309
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:46,723
I wonder what you like.

310
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:54,605
Is there anything you'd like to do?

311
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:56,149
Amusement...

312
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:57,608
What was that?

313
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:00,111
I want to go to an amusement park.

314
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:04,574
Gosh, something must be wrong with me
because I'm having trouble hearing you.

315
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:06,659
He wants to go to an amusement park.

316
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:10,246
An amusement park.

317
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,165
I see.

318
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:15,293
You want to go to an amusement park.

319
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:20,006
But I'm afraid
we can't leave the house empty.

320
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:21,090
We'll house-sit for you.

321
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:22,467
We will.

322
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:25,011
Go with Woo-hyeol and consider it a date.

323
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,097
A date? Don't be ridiculous.

324
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:29,515
It's not like that.

325
00:22:30,808 --> 00:22:33,394
We're supposed to be working,
so forget it.

326
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:44,530
Would it kill you to take the boy
when he wants to go so badly?

327
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:48,034
We can call it a date.

328
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:57,710
Welcome.

329
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:01,672
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

330
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:04,258
Welcome.

331
00:23:05,802 --> 00:23:07,136
Welcome.

332
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:09,347
Welcome.

333
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:11,432
So this is what an amusement park is.

334
00:23:11,516 --> 00:23:12,600
What's amusing here?

335
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:13,976
Quite a few things.

336
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,686
Let's head that way first.

337
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:25,613
I didn't know such a place existed.

338
00:23:26,364 --> 00:23:28,449
Should we try those hairbands on?

339
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:30,576
They're animal ears.

340
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:33,204
You put this on your head like a hat.

341
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:36,624
Butler Joo, you too.

342
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:38,793
There.

343
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:41,212
Who's the kid here, for crying out loud?

344
00:23:44,841 --> 00:23:45,883
How about this one?

345
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:49,971
Like this?

346
00:23:55,393 --> 00:23:56,352
Min-jae.

347
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:57,895
One, two, three.

348
00:24:00,398 --> 00:24:01,691
One, two, three.

349
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,113
- Here you go. Enjoy.
- Thank you.

350
00:24:07,321 --> 00:24:08,406
Min-jae, try some.

351
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:10,366
Hold it.

352
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:11,450
That's it.

353
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:18,624
Min-jae, can I have a bite?

354
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:22,044
I want to go on that ride.

355
00:24:24,755 --> 00:24:27,466
That one's kind of scary.
Will you be okay?

356
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:29,260
It's quite scary.

357
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,346
Are you kidding me?

358
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:35,057
I'm a vampire.

359
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:37,393
How could that scare me when I can fly?

360
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,729
You'll think differently
once you're on it.

361
00:24:42,064 --> 00:24:45,568
- No way.
- Come on, let's go.

362
00:24:48,905 --> 00:24:50,990
By the way,
why aren't you two holding hands?

363
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:51,949
- What?
- What?

364
00:24:52,033 --> 00:24:56,329
You should hold hands in crowded areas
so you don't get lost.

365
00:24:56,579 --> 00:24:58,831
Shouldn't grown-ups know that?

366
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:05,254
You'll get lost if you let go, so don't.

367
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:07,548
Now, come on!

368
00:25:10,718 --> 00:25:12,637
What a commendable little boy.

369
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:16,641
- Let's go.
- Okay.

370
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:23,064
Yes, you're tall enough.

371
00:25:23,147 --> 00:25:24,982
Should we measure your height?

372
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:28,486
Please stand up straight.

373
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:31,322
I'm sorry, but maybe next time.

374
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:33,908
FOR SAFETY REASONS,
RIDERS MUST BE 110CM OR TALLER

375
00:25:34,242 --> 00:25:35,284
It's okay, Min-jae.

376
00:25:35,368 --> 00:25:36,577
We'll go on a different ride.

377
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:40,873
This is a piece of cake.

378
00:25:40,957 --> 00:25:41,999
Are you sure about this?

379
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:43,709
Yes, I'm totally fine.

380
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:52,218
This doesn't seem so bad.

381
00:26:06,649 --> 00:26:07,692
Are you all right?

382
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:13,698
How can you be scared of that
when you can fly?

383
00:26:13,948 --> 00:26:16,909
Well, that's also a boat in a sense,

384
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:18,995
so I got seasick.

385
00:26:19,704 --> 00:26:21,414
I need to rest for a while.

386
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:24,542
We need to get our money's worth.

387
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:25,668
Let's keep going.

388
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:27,628
I thought you didn't want to come.

389
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:29,672
I didn't, but I'm having fun
now that I'm here.

390
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:31,048
- Come on.
- What?

391
00:26:32,008 --> 00:26:32,925
Do we have to?

392
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:35,386
My gosh!

393
00:26:38,848 --> 00:26:41,475
A haunted house
should be a piece of cake for you.

394
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:43,144
This one is right up my alley.

395
00:26:43,227 --> 00:26:46,397
I used to tussle with ghosts all the time
while stuck in the coffin for 100 years.

396
00:26:46,981 --> 00:26:48,065
Follow my lead.

397
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:49,650
Let's go.

398
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:57,158
As I said, this one is right up my alley.

399
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:00,911
They did a good job
with the decorations and all.

400
00:27:00,995 --> 00:27:02,121
It's not too shabby.

401
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:03,581
- Aren't you scared, Min-jae?
- No.

402
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:12,798
That got you, didn't it?

403
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,303
It's quite long.

404
00:27:20,514 --> 00:27:21,724
Butler Joo, I'm scared too.

405
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:22,933
What?

406
00:27:39,367 --> 00:27:40,910
Woo-hyeol, are you all right?

407
00:27:43,621 --> 00:27:45,414
I hate ghosts.

408
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:56,175
Let's take a break over here.

409
00:27:56,384 --> 00:27:58,803
- Have a seat.
- Then wait for me here.

410
00:27:58,886 --> 00:28:00,346
I'll get us some snacks.

411
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:01,889
Okay.

412
00:28:01,972 --> 00:28:02,932
Hurry back.

413
00:28:09,647 --> 00:28:11,190
Aren't you too young to sigh?

414
00:28:11,941 --> 00:28:15,236
Uncle Woo-hyeol, do you know what love is?

415
00:28:15,653 --> 00:28:17,405
What about you? Do you know what it is?

416
00:28:17,488 --> 00:28:20,574
Love is about doing everything together.

417
00:28:21,242 --> 00:28:23,744
When you see something funny

418
00:28:23,828 --> 00:28:26,163
or eat something delicious,
you want to share it with that person.

419
00:28:26,414 --> 00:28:28,207
That's what love is.

420
00:28:30,084 --> 00:28:32,169
You're quite mature for your age.

421
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:34,171
Being here...

422
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:36,966
reminds me of Ga-hyeon.

423
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:40,010
If only she could be here too.

424
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:43,556
We can bring her next time.

425
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:46,892
- Hey.
- Let's eat.

426
00:28:51,105 --> 00:28:51,939
Oh, right.

427
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:53,774
Woo-hyeol.

428
00:28:55,276 --> 00:28:56,318
Here you go.

429
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:01,740
- What's this?
- I brought it from home.

430
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:02,783
It's ox blood.

431
00:29:02,867 --> 00:29:05,494
It's not nice being left out
when we're all eating.

432
00:29:07,037 --> 00:29:08,038
Thanks.

433
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:17,089
Let's finish this and go on more rides.

434
00:29:17,465 --> 00:29:18,466
Again?

435
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:20,426
I looked into Lee Man-hwi,

436
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:22,303
but nothing was out of the ordinary.

437
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:26,515
But it seems more vampires
have been hired to Shaded Oasis.

438
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,686
MR. GU HYEONG-MAN

439
00:29:33,731 --> 00:29:35,399
What has In-hae gotten herself into?

440
00:29:41,822 --> 00:29:43,741
Finding a half-vampire is crucial,

441
00:29:44,617 --> 00:29:46,327
but the same goes for In-hae's safety.

442
00:29:46,869 --> 00:29:50,498
Please keep in mind
that she's surrounded by vampires.

443
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,754
Seon Woo-hyeol tried to become human?

444
00:29:56,837 --> 00:29:59,590
He tried all methods available
for hundreds of years.

445
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:03,093
I doubt he has given up on it.

446
00:30:04,053 --> 00:30:05,304
He's known to be persistent.

447
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:07,932
Why does an immortal vampire

448
00:30:08,015 --> 00:30:09,600
want to become human?

449
00:30:09,683 --> 00:30:11,936
That's why he was deemed insane.

450
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,814
He wants to experience love
that makes his heart beat or something.

451
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:17,650
Love that makes his heart beat?

452
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:22,071
He did seem off during our last encounter.

453
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:35,042
You failed yet again.

454
00:30:35,793 --> 00:30:37,419
You've gotten weaker.

455
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:39,630
There was definitely
something off about him.

456
00:30:40,631 --> 00:30:43,509
It's as if his vampire abilities
had diminished.

457
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:45,427
That alone doesn't confirm anything.

458
00:30:45,636 --> 00:30:47,179
I must see his scar.

459
00:30:49,098 --> 00:30:51,183
The scar that proves he's a half-vampire.

460
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:53,978
Only then will I pay you.

461
00:30:59,108 --> 00:31:00,109
By the way,

462
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:02,945
where did you learn about a half-vampire

463
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:04,446
that even I wasn't aware of?

464
00:31:07,283 --> 00:31:09,618
Must I share that information with you?

465
00:31:13,581 --> 00:31:15,207
I keep crossing the line.

466
00:31:15,291 --> 00:31:16,375
How unprofessional of me.

467
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:18,419
There isn't much time, so please hurry.

468
00:31:18,502 --> 00:31:20,129
I didn't see you as the impatient type.

469
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:21,213
All right.

470
00:31:21,297 --> 00:31:22,965
I'm not one to drag things out anyway.

471
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,990
One, two... Smile.

472
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:49,199
Hi!

473
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:50,868
Cheese.

474
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:52,286
Wave at your dad.

475
00:31:57,499 --> 00:31:58,792
Isn't this fun?

476
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:04,340
Hi!

477
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:15,434
It's so pretty, isn't it?

478
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:20,230
It is.

479
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:26,236
I finally get why people say
life is like a merry-go-round.

480
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:30,574
It keeps going round and round,
up and down.

481
00:32:31,367 --> 00:32:33,494
It may seem slow and boring,

482
00:32:33,577 --> 00:32:37,206
but when you look back,
it's filled with dazzling moments.

483
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:56,850
He must've been tired.

484
00:32:57,685 --> 00:32:59,311
It must've been a long day
for you as well.

485
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:03,023
Thanks to this little boy,

486
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:04,733
I also had fun.

487
00:33:04,817 --> 00:33:05,734
Tell me about it.

488
00:33:06,193 --> 00:33:08,028
It was bothersome at first,

489
00:33:08,112 --> 00:33:09,780
but it turned out to be fun.

490
00:33:21,417 --> 00:33:22,626
I don't want you to get lost.

491
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:41,186
Nice, Min-jae.

492
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:43,272
- Min-jae!
- It's fun, isn't it?

493
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:45,357
Min-jae!

494
00:33:45,441 --> 00:33:47,776
- What? Aunt Gi-suk!
- Min-jae.

495
00:33:48,986 --> 00:33:51,363
- Aunt Gi-suk.
- Hello.

496
00:33:51,655 --> 00:33:53,490
Min-jae's dad called.

497
00:33:53,741 --> 00:33:55,534
He apologized for running late

498
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:57,244
and asked me to pick him up.

499
00:33:57,995 --> 00:33:59,246
Min-jae, did you have fun?

500
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:01,749
- I had a great time!
- Goodness.

501
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,334
Here you go.

502
00:34:06,336 --> 00:34:08,130
It must've been tiring
to look after him all day,

503
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:09,298
so enjoy it together.

504
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:10,215
Thank you.

505
00:34:10,299 --> 00:34:12,426
Thank you for today.

506
00:34:13,343 --> 00:34:14,553
Min-jae, let's go.

507
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,513
Here's your backpack.

508
00:34:16,597 --> 00:34:17,639
Say bye.

509
00:34:17,723 --> 00:34:20,225
- Goodbye!
- Bye.

510
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:22,227
Let's go.

511
00:34:23,771 --> 00:34:25,022
Gosh.

512
00:34:25,105 --> 00:34:26,106
Excuse me.

513
00:34:26,857 --> 00:34:27,858
You over there.

514
00:34:28,484 --> 00:34:31,028
Aren't you the detective
who came by a few days ago?

515
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:35,407
Gosh, you have a good memory.

516
00:34:35,491 --> 00:34:37,242
You have a memorable face.

517
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:40,037
Is this where you're staying?

518
00:34:40,788 --> 00:34:43,749
Yes, I am.

519
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:45,083
How odd.

520
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:47,461
Anyway, enjoy your evening.

521
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:49,129
- I'll get you ox blood some other time.
- Okay.

522
00:34:49,213 --> 00:34:50,172
- Take care.
- Sure.

523
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:51,715
- Bye.
- Let's go.

524
00:34:51,799 --> 00:34:53,383
Dad will be home soon.

525
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:55,886
What was that?

526
00:34:56,178 --> 00:34:57,387
Are you a detective?

527
00:34:57,763 --> 00:34:58,806
That's right.

528
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:09,149
We should talk.

529
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:10,567
Follow me.

530
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:19,952
A detective? What's going on?

531
00:35:20,953 --> 00:35:22,329
You tell him.

532
00:35:24,665 --> 00:35:28,752
I've been interviewing the neighbors
regarding the missing gold,

533
00:35:28,836 --> 00:35:31,129
and there's definitely something fishy

534
00:35:31,213 --> 00:35:32,840
about Joo Dong-il, Butler Joo's father.

535
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:37,469
At first, I was convinced
he had taken off with the gold.

536
00:35:37,845 --> 00:35:40,973
But now I'm wondering
if he was in fact kidnapped

537
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:42,975
because of the gold.

538
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:45,811
- Right.
- Kidnapped?

539
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:49,273
Apparently, an unidentifiable vehicle
in the neighborhood took him.

540
00:35:50,023 --> 00:35:52,234
I'll have to look into it more,

541
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:54,403
but it's been giving me an odd feeling.

542
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:57,531
- Right?
- Right.

543
00:35:57,614 --> 00:35:58,657
Something isn't right.

544
00:35:59,575 --> 00:36:02,703
Let's keep this from Butler Joo for now.

545
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,205
We don't want her to worry for no reason.

546
00:36:05,289 --> 00:36:06,832
- Right.
- Of course.

547
00:36:09,001 --> 00:36:11,461
OUR GRANDMA'S TTEOKBOKKI

548
00:36:25,267 --> 00:36:26,560
What are you doing out here?

549
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:31,273
I felt bad eating it alone inside,

550
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:33,191
so I came out to eat
and also to get some air.

551
00:36:38,447 --> 00:36:39,865
Why are you eating that?

552
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,078
I'm giving myself a special treat today.

553
00:36:45,621 --> 00:36:46,538
What?

554
00:36:50,167 --> 00:36:52,502
Woo-hyeol, wait. Stop.

555
00:36:52,586 --> 00:36:54,504
What if you collapse again?

556
00:36:54,588 --> 00:36:55,547
Stop.

557
00:36:56,465 --> 00:36:57,591
You can't!

558
00:36:57,674 --> 00:36:59,051
My goodness!

559
00:37:00,928 --> 00:37:02,763
It's good. I approve.

560
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,391
Wait. That's enough.

561
00:37:06,475 --> 00:37:08,060
Please stop eating.

562
00:37:08,268 --> 00:37:09,937
Stop!

563
00:37:21,615 --> 00:37:23,075
The moon is bright,

564
00:37:23,659 --> 00:37:25,118
and I'm tipsy from the food.

565
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:28,497
It feels great.

566
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:31,625
I can't believe you.

567
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:35,003
Are you sure you want to
become human to experience love

568
00:37:35,087 --> 00:37:37,547
and not because you want to
eat human food?

569
00:37:38,507 --> 00:37:40,384
I'd be lying if I denied that.

570
00:37:46,306 --> 00:37:47,349
Right.

571
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:51,895
So how about we settle on a date?

572
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:54,815
A date?

573
00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:56,316
Blood filled with love.

574
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,277
You said you can become human
if you drink it.

575
00:38:00,112 --> 00:38:01,405
When will be good for you?

576
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:02,864
Are you...

577
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:07,577
really going to give me your blood?

578
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:10,831
It's something you desperately desired.

579
00:38:11,707 --> 00:38:13,792
Turning human and experiencing love
that makes your heart beat.

580
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:19,256
I'd love to be of help.

581
00:38:19,339 --> 00:38:21,383
You'll let a vampire suck your blood?

582
00:38:21,842 --> 00:38:25,137
Have you no fear of vampires at all?

583
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:31,059
People used to tell me
I can make their blood run cold.

584
00:38:31,143 --> 00:38:32,811
So why would I fear vampires?

585
00:38:34,438 --> 00:38:35,689
You're right.

586
00:38:35,772 --> 00:38:36,773
For a moment,

587
00:38:36,857 --> 00:38:39,943
I forgot that you are a tough woman
who can bite vampires when needed.

588
00:38:43,196 --> 00:38:44,948
Then...

589
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:48,869
how about on the 100th day
from when we first met?

590
00:38:49,578 --> 00:38:53,623
I'll invite your friends over that day
and throw you a birthday party.

591
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:55,625
A birthday party?

592
00:38:55,709 --> 00:38:56,585
Yes.

593
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:59,379
You'll be reborn as a human being.

594
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:02,841
We'll buy a cake and blow out candles.

595
00:39:03,258 --> 00:39:04,676
What do you say?

596
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:07,804
Sounds good.

597
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:18,106
Won't you have any regrets?

598
00:39:18,315 --> 00:39:19,149
About what?

599
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:23,153
If you become human,
you will no longer be immortal.

600
00:39:24,071 --> 00:39:25,072
Not at all.

601
00:39:26,323 --> 00:39:27,991
As a mortal,

602
00:39:28,075 --> 00:39:29,534
I'll have warmer hands,

603
00:39:30,285 --> 00:39:32,871
enjoy delicious human food,

604
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:38,168
and experience love
that makes my heart beat.

605
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:53,433
Why does an immortal vampire

606
00:39:53,517 --> 00:39:55,352
want to become human?

607
00:39:55,936 --> 00:39:58,105
That's why he was deemed insane.

608
00:39:59,231 --> 00:40:02,109
He wants to experience love
that makes his heart beat or something.

609
00:40:52,534 --> 00:40:54,119
- Please.
- Please spare my life.

610
00:40:56,705 --> 00:40:58,790
Please spare my life.

611
00:40:59,583 --> 00:41:00,584
Please...

612
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:13,430
- Please spare my life.
- Please spare my life.

613
00:41:13,513 --> 00:41:14,973
- Please.
- Please spare my life.

614
00:41:15,056 --> 00:41:16,641
- Please.
- Please spare my life.

615
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:19,060
Don't worry.

616
00:41:19,311 --> 00:41:22,397
Why would I kill my feeding source?

617
00:41:26,318 --> 00:41:28,737
- Please spare my life.
- Please don't kill me.

618
00:41:46,713 --> 00:41:48,006
I don't want you to get lost.

619
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:04,397
Here you go.

620
00:42:06,483 --> 00:42:07,442
All right.

621
00:42:09,236 --> 00:42:11,279
Since we have a bigger staff now,

622
00:42:11,363 --> 00:42:13,490
let's put it to use
and clean up the place.

623
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:16,368
Dong-seop, you'll mostly be working
in the kitchen,

624
00:42:16,451 --> 00:42:18,203
so clean up over there.

625
00:42:18,286 --> 00:42:20,330
Sang-hae, you're in charge
of the living room.

626
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,123
Unbelievable.

627
00:42:22,666 --> 00:42:23,583
What is it?

628
00:42:23,667 --> 00:42:24,918
Do you have a problem?

629
00:42:25,168 --> 00:42:27,671
I didn't say that.

630
00:42:27,754 --> 00:42:30,298
But it's just that the house
is clean enough.

631
00:42:30,382 --> 00:42:32,050
Is a big cleanup necessary?

632
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:36,763
Cleanliness can make or break
a guest house.

633
00:42:37,514 --> 00:42:40,809
Woo-hyeol, you'll clean the rooms with me
and wash the bedding.

634
00:42:41,017 --> 00:42:41,935
Just the two of us?

635
00:42:44,521 --> 00:42:46,940
Who are these people?

636
00:42:47,023 --> 00:42:48,108
Oh, right.

637
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:51,653
They're the new members of our staff.

638
00:42:52,612 --> 00:42:54,781
Park Dong-seop and Lee Sang-hae.

639
00:42:54,864 --> 00:42:57,033
Guys, say hello.

640
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:02,247
How does this place
have more staff members than guests?

641
00:43:09,629 --> 00:43:10,755
Get to work.

642
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:17,554
Hello?

643
00:43:18,388 --> 00:43:21,182
How did you get my number?

644
00:43:23,852 --> 00:43:25,353
Hang up, you bastard!

645
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:28,523
If you call me again, I'll call the cops!

646
00:43:56,301 --> 00:43:57,844
What was that?

647
00:43:57,927 --> 00:43:59,846
When will we get through all of this
at this pace?

648
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:01,139
How's this?

649
00:44:09,439 --> 00:44:10,774
Join me.

650
00:44:16,988 --> 00:44:19,699
By the way, aren't you the one
in charge of the laundry?

651
00:44:19,783 --> 00:44:21,576
No, we agreed to do it together.

652
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:24,537
We're supposed to wash and change
the bedding together.

653
00:44:24,621 --> 00:44:25,789
Changing it too?

654
00:44:26,331 --> 00:44:27,540
Sure.

655
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:33,838
What are you...

656
00:44:38,635 --> 00:44:39,886
Sorry about that.

657
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:41,930
How does that taste? Do you like it?

658
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:44,808
- That was payback.
- It was.

659
00:44:44,891 --> 00:44:46,184
- Let me wipe it off.
- Okay.

660
00:45:08,123 --> 00:45:09,290
Let's continue.

661
00:45:12,585 --> 00:45:14,379
- Are you all right?
- I'm good.

662
00:45:15,046 --> 00:45:16,506
Get up, will you?

663
00:45:16,589 --> 00:45:17,924
You guys look great.

664
00:45:21,511 --> 00:45:22,887
I'm sorry to interrupt,

665
00:45:22,971 --> 00:45:24,848
but can I have a word with Ms. Joo?

666
00:45:39,154 --> 00:45:40,280
Why didn't you tell me?

667
00:45:40,947 --> 00:45:43,116
- Sorry?
- How long have you known

668
00:45:43,533 --> 00:45:44,909
that Seon Woo-hyeol is a vampire?

669
00:45:47,996 --> 00:45:49,330
Why are you surprised?

670
00:45:49,414 --> 00:45:50,582
Did you think I wouldn't know?

671
00:45:51,833 --> 00:45:52,792
Well...

672
00:45:55,211 --> 00:45:58,256
You probably know this,

673
00:45:58,673 --> 00:45:59,716
but Woo-hyeol isn't--

674
00:45:59,799 --> 00:46:02,719
Do you think you know him that well?

675
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:05,180
Then

676
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,433
you must know that I'm the Hae-sun
he's been waiting for.

677
00:46:10,185 --> 00:46:13,480
Don't you feel bad for him when he has
waited for one woman for centuries?

678
00:46:14,981 --> 00:46:16,524
The least you could do is help him.

679
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:20,570
Get out of his life while I ask nicely.

680
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:31,247
I don't want to do that.

681
00:46:32,665 --> 00:46:34,417
Whatever Woo-hyeol is,

682
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:37,545
and whether or not you're Hae-sun,

683
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:41,049
I'm going to follow my heart.

684
00:46:42,217 --> 00:46:45,512
And that's not something
one can have a say over.

685
00:46:47,305 --> 00:46:48,264
Right.

686
00:46:48,848 --> 00:46:50,391
I appreciate your honesty.

687
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:52,602
If that's how you feel,

688
00:46:52,685 --> 00:46:54,854
I'll have to follow my heart as well.

689
00:46:57,732 --> 00:46:58,608
Wait and see.

690
00:47:19,629 --> 00:47:22,131
Will you lose your woman
to someone who isn't even human?

691
00:47:22,632 --> 00:47:24,425
Are you scared because he's a vampire?

692
00:47:24,634 --> 00:47:26,678
Would it be different if he were human?

693
00:47:27,804 --> 00:47:29,264
What answer are you looking for?

694
00:47:29,347 --> 00:47:31,849
Are you going to let them
stay in the same house?

695
00:47:31,933 --> 00:47:33,101
Why do I have to watch them

696
00:47:33,184 --> 00:47:35,061
be in love in the guest house
that I invested in?

697
00:47:35,144 --> 00:47:36,145
Calm down.

698
00:47:36,646 --> 00:47:39,440
An emotional approach
won't do you any good.

699
00:47:39,524 --> 00:47:41,234
Things only got this bad

700
00:47:41,317 --> 00:47:43,027
because you were sitting on your hands.

701
00:47:43,111 --> 00:47:45,071
- Am I wrong?
- Ms. Na.

702
00:47:47,532 --> 00:47:51,411
I won't sit by and let them
blossom their romance in that mansion.

703
00:47:51,494 --> 00:47:53,830
In fact, I'll make sure it never happens.

704
00:47:54,956 --> 00:47:59,294
You should also get it together
if you don't want to lose Joo In-hae.

705
00:48:12,181 --> 00:48:14,058
Is this all the sunscreen we have?

706
00:48:14,142 --> 00:48:15,101
Here's more.

707
00:48:16,853 --> 00:48:20,106
I hate having to pack every time we move.

708
00:48:20,356 --> 00:48:22,066
We lucked out though.

709
00:48:22,275 --> 00:48:25,320
Once we move into Shaded Oasis,
we'll stay there for good.

710
00:48:25,403 --> 00:48:27,155
Anyway, where's Rose at?

711
00:48:28,531 --> 00:48:29,490
I'm here.

712
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:32,368
Speak of the devil.

713
00:48:32,619 --> 00:48:35,371
Why do you need a truck
when you barely have any stuff?

714
00:48:35,455 --> 00:48:36,831
It's not like we can teleport them.

715
00:48:37,373 --> 00:48:39,208
Get rid of some stuff while you're at it.

716
00:48:39,292 --> 00:48:40,585
It's all junk anyway.

717
00:48:41,377 --> 00:48:43,546
I didn't expect Butler Joo
to accept you guys though.

718
00:48:43,963 --> 00:48:46,132
Woo-hyeol collapsing worked in our favor.

719
00:48:46,215 --> 00:48:47,675
Also, they--

720
00:48:47,759 --> 00:48:48,676
Dong-seop.

721
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:51,346
- Nothing.
- It's nothing.

722
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:54,182
While you're there,
take good care of Woo-hyeol.

723
00:48:56,351 --> 00:49:00,063
By the way, I recently came across a house
while working that gave me the chills.

724
00:49:00,897 --> 00:49:03,483
And Man-hwi came out of it.

725
00:49:04,317 --> 00:49:05,735
- Lee Man-hwi?
- Yes.

726
00:49:07,153 --> 00:49:09,864
God knows what he's up to.

727
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:11,157
Did you go inside?

728
00:49:11,532 --> 00:49:13,743
Are you insane? Why would I go in?

729
00:49:13,993 --> 00:49:16,079
Enough with the nonsense.

730
00:49:16,329 --> 00:49:17,455
Let's get going.

731
00:49:18,915 --> 00:49:19,916
Where's the truck?

732
00:49:19,999 --> 00:49:20,958
- Out front.
- Out front?

733
00:49:21,042 --> 00:49:22,418
- Come on.
- Meet me out front.

734
00:49:22,794 --> 00:49:24,545
Hurry up, will you?

735
00:49:33,846 --> 00:49:35,390
How are you feeling?

736
00:49:49,821 --> 00:49:52,448
I'm still in a manageable state.

737
00:49:54,117 --> 00:49:55,368
That's good to hear.

738
00:50:01,457 --> 00:50:04,460
You don't seem too good yourself either.

739
00:50:05,545 --> 00:50:08,172
How could I be at ease
after dropping that bomb?

740
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:10,883
I deserve it.

741
00:50:16,681 --> 00:50:19,225
What's the point of blaming someone
after all this time?

742
00:50:20,852 --> 00:50:22,854
It's all in the past.

743
00:50:23,396 --> 00:50:26,023
And it's not like the truth
can change anything.

744
00:50:27,608 --> 00:50:28,985
So please don't let it get to you.

745
00:50:32,155 --> 00:50:33,531
I appreciate your understanding.

746
00:50:39,078 --> 00:50:40,204
Still,

747
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:42,498
thanks to you,

748
00:50:42,874 --> 00:50:45,418
I was given the opportunity
to become human.

749
00:50:51,257 --> 00:50:52,258
And now,

750
00:50:53,885 --> 00:50:55,136
I'm almost there.

751
00:50:57,388 --> 00:50:58,473
Is that so?

752
00:50:59,849 --> 00:51:01,601
Is the blood of the one
who opened the coffin

753
00:51:02,018 --> 00:51:03,561
filled with love?

754
00:51:05,521 --> 00:51:06,564
Yes.

755
00:51:08,399 --> 00:51:10,318
Finally, your dream will come true.

756
00:51:15,865 --> 00:51:17,200
When I become human,

757
00:51:18,493 --> 00:51:20,286
Butler Joo will also be happy, right?

758
00:51:22,371 --> 00:51:23,956
What did you just say?

759
00:51:27,418 --> 00:51:29,712
That Butler Joo will be happy.

760
00:51:31,881 --> 00:51:32,924
What is it?

761
00:51:33,007 --> 00:51:34,383
What do you mean by that?

762
00:51:34,967 --> 00:51:36,636
Why would you say that

763
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:38,596
when you must sacrifice her
to become human?

764
00:51:43,601 --> 00:51:44,977
What are you saying?

765
00:51:58,241 --> 00:51:59,534
What brings you here at this hour?

766
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:02,411
I have intriguing information.

767
00:52:03,204 --> 00:52:06,249
Do you have an update on the half-vampire?

768
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:09,669
Not exactly.

769
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:13,756
I thought I made myself clear.

770
00:52:15,591 --> 00:52:17,760
It concerns a woman named Joo In-hae.

771
00:52:31,774 --> 00:52:33,359
Why would you say that

772
00:52:33,442 --> 00:52:35,278
when you must sacrifice her
to become human?

773
00:52:38,197 --> 00:52:39,282
I mean,

774
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:42,577
offering a few drops of blood

775
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:44,161
isn't that big of a sacrifice, is it?

776
00:52:48,875 --> 00:52:50,334
What is it?

777
00:52:50,418 --> 00:52:52,086
Butler Joo can't be happy.

778
00:52:54,046 --> 00:52:55,464
What do you mean?

779
00:52:55,548 --> 00:52:58,175
That's the fate of humans
who open a vampire's coffin.

780
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:01,429
They must either die
after giving up their blood

781
00:53:02,471 --> 00:53:04,140
or kill that vampire in order to live.

782
00:53:06,309 --> 00:53:07,518
Between you and Butler Joo,

783
00:53:08,352 --> 00:53:10,062
only one can live.

784
00:53:11,731 --> 00:53:13,107
To become human,

785
00:53:14,567 --> 00:53:16,736
you must suck her dry of her blood.

786
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:11,040
What do you think you're doing?!

787
00:54:13,459 --> 00:54:15,127
What are you going to do to In-hae?

788
00:54:23,844 --> 00:54:24,845
Yes?

789
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:27,390
What is it?

790
00:54:33,604 --> 00:54:35,064
How are you here?

791
00:54:38,234 --> 00:54:39,318
How have you been?

792
00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:44,115
Did you think I wouldn't find you

793
00:54:44,657 --> 00:54:46,033
if you hid in a place like this?

794
00:54:46,701 --> 00:54:48,953
You can run, but you can't hide from me.

795
00:54:51,038 --> 00:54:52,957
Come with me while I ask nicely.

796
00:54:53,457 --> 00:54:55,042
Let go of me!

797
00:54:55,126 --> 00:54:56,252
I'll call the cops!

798
00:54:56,335 --> 00:54:57,962
They don't bother with romantic affairs!

799
00:54:58,921 --> 00:55:00,756
You and I will talk this out.

800
00:55:06,137 --> 00:55:09,098
Tell me why you're hanging around In-hae.

801
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:12,435
I know what you are.

802
00:55:13,811 --> 00:55:16,605
I also know what you're trying to get
by staying here.

803
00:55:25,114 --> 00:55:26,824
Don't shoot your mouth off

804
00:55:27,783 --> 00:55:29,118
about things you don't know.

805
00:55:33,122 --> 00:55:34,957
Are you really
going to kill her or something?

806
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,133
Love that makes your heart beat?

807
00:55:45,968 --> 00:55:48,554
Do you believe
that a blood-sucking vampire

808
00:55:48,804 --> 00:55:50,931
could ever fall in love?

809
00:55:57,897 --> 00:55:59,190
You're a monster.

810
00:56:02,818 --> 00:56:04,236
- Let go of me!
- Come on!

811
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:05,488
Let go!

812
00:56:06,113 --> 00:56:07,031
Damn it!

813
00:56:07,114 --> 00:56:08,991
- Let me go!
- What do you think you're doing?

814
00:56:09,658 --> 00:56:10,576
What the hell?

815
00:56:12,495 --> 00:56:15,081
What are you doing? She said, let go.

816
00:56:15,956 --> 00:56:18,709
There seems to be a misunderstanding,
but I'm her boyfriend.

817
00:56:19,085 --> 00:56:20,961
This doesn't concern you,
so stay out of it.

818
00:56:21,921 --> 00:56:23,130
Boyfriend, my ass.

819
00:56:23,214 --> 00:56:25,800
Things ended ages ago, you stalker!

820
00:56:25,883 --> 00:56:26,967
Shut up!

821
00:56:27,051 --> 00:56:28,469
- You need to--
- Damn it!

822
00:56:45,569 --> 00:56:46,737
You bastard.

823
00:56:47,154 --> 00:56:48,364
Let go of me!

824
00:56:48,447 --> 00:56:50,866
This wouldn't have happened
if you had followed me quietly!

825
00:56:51,951 --> 00:56:53,661
Let me go!

826
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:55,621
It hurts!

827
00:56:55,704 --> 00:56:56,831
Let go of her!

828
00:56:56,914 --> 00:56:58,374
Why you...

829
00:57:07,258 --> 00:57:08,300
Stop.

830
00:57:08,384 --> 00:57:09,927
Get lost, you bastard!

831
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:11,512
Why you...

832
00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:23,732
Butler Joo.

833
00:57:24,316 --> 00:57:25,401
She's in danger.

834
00:57:35,035 --> 00:57:38,080
I see you both have a death wish.

835
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:50,342
Butler Joo, are you all right?

836
00:58:07,109 --> 00:58:09,445
Hey, stop right there!

837
00:58:16,452 --> 00:58:17,786
Woo-hyeol.

838
00:58:45,731 --> 00:58:46,774
Stay away from her!

839
00:58:48,484 --> 00:58:49,568
In-hae.

840
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:50,986
In-hae.

841
00:58:51,654 --> 00:58:52,571
In-hae, are you all right?

842
00:58:53,239 --> 00:58:54,073
In-hae.

843
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:02,373
Stay with me.

844
00:59:03,832 --> 00:59:05,751
Stay with me, In-hae.

845
00:59:06,168 --> 00:59:08,003
In-hae.

846
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:52,339
HEARTBEAT

847
00:59:52,423 --> 00:59:54,967
Don't even think about coming near her.

848
00:59:55,217 --> 00:59:56,343
Just get lost.

849
00:59:56,427 --> 00:59:58,846
I want to follow where my heart leads me.

850
00:59:58,929 --> 01:00:00,014
Come to your senses!

851
01:00:00,431 --> 01:00:03,017
Vampires at a guest house for humans?

852
01:00:03,642 --> 01:00:05,769
Pay back the investment
and the penalty for breach of contract.

853
01:00:05,853 --> 01:00:07,563
You were lying there bleeding.

854
01:00:07,855 --> 01:00:11,025
I can't forgive myself for letting
my instincts get the best of me.

855
01:00:11,108 --> 01:00:13,027
You want to find Butler Joo's father?

856
01:00:13,235 --> 01:00:15,404
She shouldn't be alone and lonely.

857
01:00:16,113 --> 01:00:17,197
I must leave.

858
01:00:17,531 --> 01:00:18,991
So that I don't become a monster.

859
01:00:19,074 --> 01:00:20,659
Capture Seon Woo-hyeol alive for me.

860
01:00:20,909 --> 01:00:23,454
Just be ready to pay a generous fee
for my services.

861
01:00:24,705 --> 01:00:26,790
You're going to die, Woo-hyeol!

862
01:00:30,336 --> 01:00:32,338
