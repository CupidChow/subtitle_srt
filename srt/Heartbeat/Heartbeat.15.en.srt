HEARTBEAT

2
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,298
ALL CHARACTERS, NAMES,
ORGANIZATIONS, GROUPS, EVENTS,

3
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,300
AND SETTINGS ARE FICTITIOUS
AND ANIMAL SAFETY GUIDELINES WERE FOLLOWED

4
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:57,558
He couldn't suck you dry
of your blood to become human,

5
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:00,352
so he went to die alone.

6
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:04,064
No, Woo-hyeol.

7
00:01:17,787 --> 00:01:18,746
Woo-hyeol.

8
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:22,208
How can you leave like this?

9
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:33,010
How can my heart ache so much

10
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:36,972
when it can't even beat?

11
00:01:46,065 --> 00:01:47,066
Woo-hyeol.

12
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:49,610
I'm sorry.

EPISODE 15

14
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:09,755
Excuse me.

15
00:02:09,839 --> 00:02:12,174
Can you track a phone for me?

16
00:02:12,258 --> 00:02:13,968
There's someone I have to find.

17
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:15,219
Right.

18
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:19,640
I'm afraid that'll be difficult
unless you're the owner of the device.

19
00:02:19,974 --> 00:02:20,850
I'm sorry.

20
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:28,649
Where on earth is he?

21
00:02:30,568 --> 00:02:31,569
Hey, Sang-hae!

22
00:02:38,284 --> 00:02:39,326
Have you found Woo-hyeol?

23
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:46,584
Not yet?

24
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,087
What do we do?

25
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:54,258
I asked everyone that I know to tell me

26
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:55,926
if and when they see Woo-hyeol.

27
00:02:56,594 --> 00:02:57,720
Thanks, Rose.

28
00:02:57,803 --> 00:02:59,263
Not at all. Of course I should help out.

29
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:03,225
How will we find him
when he left to go die?

30
00:03:03,309 --> 00:03:04,894
Who says he's dying?

31
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:08,689
We found him even when he hid
in the cave to become human.

32
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:10,900
We'll find him this time too.

33
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:12,109
No matter what.

34
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,819
- Keep searching.
- Let's go, Sang-hae.

35
00:03:38,344 --> 00:03:40,346
The device you reached is turned off.

36
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:42,264
You will be connected to voicemail.

37
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:46,852
Happy Blood Day.

38
00:03:46,936 --> 00:03:50,356
You'll drink blood filled with love
and become human.

39
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:53,108
I don't think that's the best idea.

40
00:03:53,359 --> 00:03:57,404
Why not? Don't you want
to become human as soon as possible?

41
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:01,241
I want to protect you
for as long as I can.

42
00:04:07,081 --> 00:04:08,582
So that's why he said that.

43
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:12,211
He was going to leave.

44
00:04:23,806 --> 00:04:26,642
The redevelopment of this neighborhood

45
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:28,644
should've been carried out
a long time ago.

46
00:04:29,228 --> 00:04:30,896
It's such a shame.

47
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,898
It's still not too late.

48
00:04:32,982 --> 00:04:36,151
Of course not.
We're always ready for redevelopment.

49
00:04:36,652 --> 00:04:37,695
But you see,

50
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,447
there's one thing that worries me.

51
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:42,032
Something that worries you?

52
00:04:42,116 --> 00:04:43,158
Shaded Oasis.

53
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:45,828
Shaded Oasis Guest House?

54
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,037
What about that place?

55
00:04:51,834 --> 00:04:55,838
I heard a strange rumor about that house.

56
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,256
A strange...

57
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:58,507
Rumor?

58
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:01,427
Gi-suk.

59
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,722
Gi-suk!

60
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:07,474
Gosh, you startled me!

61
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,812
What were you thinking about
that you didn't even notice me come in?

62
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:13,313
I could've been a customer.

63
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:14,815
It's about yesterday.

64
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:17,735
What that woman told us
has been on my mind.

65
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:21,655
Oh, about a vampire
living in that mansion?

66
00:05:21,739 --> 00:05:22,614
Yes.

67
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:24,825
Gosh, a vampire? That's absurd.

68
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:28,537
She looked normal, but maybe she isn't.

69
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,915
Mr. Ox Blood is the one who's not normal.

70
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:33,333
What makes you say that?

71
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:36,211
He always comes to buy ox blood,

72
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:37,337
and he talks funny too.

73
00:05:38,047 --> 00:05:39,298
He's definitely not normal.

74
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:42,092
Come on,
maybe he just loves ox blood soup.

75
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:43,761
Don't jump to conclusions.

76
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:47,556
We'll see about that.

77
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,778
Tell me why you need
a half-vampire's blood,

78
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:03,739
and I'll tell you what I know.

79
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:10,996
To escape an inevitable fate.

80
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:12,247
Fate?

81
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:16,710
I need a half-vampire's blood
to escape the fate of dying young

82
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:19,171
that has been passed down in my family.

83
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,928
Humans don't change, do they?

84
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:33,102
Prepare a weapon
made of hawthorn wood and silver.

85
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:35,104
A knife would be best

86
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,481
to kill him once and for all.

87
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:42,569
The scar that only half-vampires have.

88
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:46,406
If you stab deep into that scar,

89
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,493
you'll be able to get what you want.

90
00:07:00,546 --> 00:07:01,588
Mr. Shin.

91
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:04,174
About the house
that you told me to look into...

92
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:05,175
Yes.

93
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:06,552
Did you find out anything?

94
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,928
It seems like Lee Man-hwi

95
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,556
had been locking up humans there

96
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,182
and sucking their blood.

97
00:07:13,392 --> 00:07:15,018
- What?
- And...

98
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:18,105
Ms. Joo In-hae's missing father

99
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,816
was confined in that house
and was recently released.

100
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:34,037
You kidnapped and locked up live humans
and sucked their blood.

101
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:35,205
Are you out of your mind?

102
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,875
I had to survive somehow.

103
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,793
- But still, how could you--
- Damn it!

104
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:43,088
What's with you?

105
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:46,592
You and I both need
someone else's blood to live.

106
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:55,434
I only did what Na Hae-won hired me to do.

107
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:57,811
Ms. Na?

108
00:07:57,895 --> 00:08:00,731
I don't know what came over her,
but she was hung up on that mansion.

109
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,774
And she told me
to bring it to her at all costs.

110
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:04,860
You know how she can be.

111
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,906
Because the owner of the house
was so adamant about not selling it,

112
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:12,993
I guess she wanted him dead.

113
00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:17,372
That's why I kept him.

114
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:19,625
You kidnapped a person for a mansion?

115
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,293
Is that how you guys do things?

116
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:22,294
What's wrong?

117
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:27,841
Are you upset
because I messed with Joo In-hae's father?

118
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:29,551
Are you two together or something?

119
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:31,720
Do you still not understand?

120
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:36,475
You destroyed a family
by kidnapping and confining him!

121
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:37,726
Exactly.

122
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:41,355
He should've sold the house
when I told him to do so nicely.

123
00:08:42,064 --> 00:08:44,775
He's the one who blew things
out of proportion by being stubborn.

124
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:46,360
This is where it ends.

125
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:48,403
I don't want
anything to do with you anymore.

126
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:51,156
Do you think you can capture
Seon Woo-hyeol without me?

127
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,992
You're the one
who told me you had him when you didn't.

128
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:56,453
Damn it.

129
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:00,082
Seon Woo-hyeol.

130
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:03,252
I should've ended it with him back then.

131
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:07,047
I'll do this on my own.

132
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,303
Be my guest.

133
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:16,014
It's not going to be easy.

134
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:48,422
I ask that you leave the mansion alone.

135
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:51,925
Butler Joo found her father
and is finally about to be happy.

136
00:09:52,718 --> 00:09:55,595
Putting her through such difficulty again
is too cruel.

137
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:59,725
Please let go of your greed
for that mansion.

138
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,853
She said she inherited the mansion.

139
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:06,898
No way.

140
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:10,444
Did her dead father
come back to life or something?

141
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:19,369
Ms. Na,

142
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:21,079
do you know a man named Lee Man-hwi?

143
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,082
Why do you ask?

144
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,418
But how do you know him?

145
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:28,253
I don't think that's what's important.

146
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:30,714
Is what he said true?

147
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:33,800
Did you order him
to kidnap and lock up In-hae's father?

148
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:35,177
What did you say?

149
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:37,387
Is that what he told you?

150
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:40,057
Her father was just released
from Lee Man-hwi's house.

151
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:44,519
In-hae inherited the mansion
because he had been declared legally dead.

152
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:49,399
You faked his disappearance
when he's been alive all along.

153
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:51,193
Did you have to take it this far

154
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:52,694
because of some mansion?!

155
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:56,281
You really believe such nonsense?

156
00:10:56,365 --> 00:10:57,532
Kidnapping and confinement?

157
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,285
Do you think I'm crazy?

158
00:11:00,786 --> 00:11:02,412
You said it yourself

159
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:05,832
that you always get your way.

160
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:10,921
I heard your company is planning
the redevelopment of Gongcheon-dong.

161
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:14,591
If Shaded Oasis is what you're after,

162
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:16,093
you'd better stop now.

163
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:17,052
No.

164
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:19,388
I have no intention of doing so.

165
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:22,808
I have to finish what I started.

166
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,450
I didn't expect you to call me.

167
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:41,618
You.

168
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,912
What kind of rumors
are you spreading about me?

169
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:45,163
What are you talking about?

170
00:11:45,247 --> 00:11:47,374
What's with all the kidnapping
and confinement?

171
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:50,043
Why are you putting the blame on me
for what you did?

172
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:53,296
You called me for the first time
in ages to say that?

173
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:57,426
I told you to buy the mansion,
not kidnap a person.

174
00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:00,345
You said to bring it to you at all costs.

175
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:02,389
I did what I was told to do.

176
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:03,306
What?

177
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:05,058
Are you crazy?

178
00:12:05,142 --> 00:12:07,477
I'm about to go crazy, so leave me alone.

179
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:10,856
Do you know the state I'm in
because of Seon Woo-hyeol?

180
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:13,191
Hang up.

181
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:39,676
In-hae, have you had dinner yet?

182
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:10,165
In-hae.

183
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:13,460
Is something wrong?

184
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:17,380
Dad.

185
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:20,008
Woo-hyeol is gone.

186
00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:22,135
What do you mean?

187
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:24,221
He left this mansion...

188
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:27,766
for good.

189
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,187
I should be there for him.

190
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:38,652
He was always there for me
when things were tough.

191
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:46,910
What am I supposed to do
when he left without a word?

192
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,996
How am I supposed to live on?

193
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:53,583
In-hae.

194
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:54,751
I'm the reason...

195
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:58,046
he couldn't become human.

196
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:02,133
I opened the coffin a day early.

197
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:05,053
This is all my fault.

198
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:06,763
I'm the one to blame.

199
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:12,102
He might die if we leave him on his own.

200
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:13,562
What are you saying?

201
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:16,147
What do you mean he's going to die?

202
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:22,654
I have to find him no matter what.

203
00:14:24,823 --> 00:14:26,866
I can't let him die all alone.

204
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:32,289
What do I do, Dad?

205
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:37,335
What do I do if he dies like this?

206
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:41,339
In-hae.

207
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:43,508
By any chance,

208
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:44,926
do you have

209
00:14:45,594 --> 00:14:46,761
feelings for him?

210
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:03,695
I'm not sure if we should
suddenly show up like this.

211
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:06,781
I'm not only doing this for my sake.

212
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:10,076
It's for everyone's sake.

213
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:12,537
That's true, but...

214
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:16,583
We can't blow this chance

215
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,376
after waiting for so long.

216
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,669
Of course not.

217
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:31,514
Hello, what is this about?

218
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:37,354
We're here to share some information

219
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,439
about the redevelopment of Gongcheon-dong.

220
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:41,358
Wait, hold on.

221
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:43,360
Aren't you the one

222
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,820
who asked me to make a suit
for Mr. Seon Woo-hyeol

223
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,281
a long time ago?

224
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:49,824
Gosh, hello.

225
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:51,076
Right.

226
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:52,369
It's been a while.

227
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:54,788
What happened?

228
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:58,083
It seemed like you had gone missing
and people were looking for you.

229
00:15:58,792 --> 00:15:59,959
Right.

230
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:01,628
I had some business to take care of.

231
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,381
Anyway,

232
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:05,882
what brings you here?

233
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,884
Right, this.

234
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:11,429
REDEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT

235
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:14,474
You're not going to get in the way of it

236
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:17,268
by refusing
to sell the house again, are you?

237
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:20,814
Think carefully.

238
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:24,401
An opportunity like this
might not come again in your lifetime.

239
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:27,195
She's right. It's now or never.

240
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:31,074
So please persuade your daughter, okay?

241
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:32,951
This redevelopment

242
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:36,371
will bring you more profit
than running a guest house.

243
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:38,707
- Right?
- Of course, there's no doubt about it.

244
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:42,293
If you find it uncomfortable
to discuss it with her yourself,

245
00:16:42,377 --> 00:16:45,422
should we meet with her
and try to persuade her?

246
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:48,591
That's okay. My daughter
hasn't been feeling well,

247
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:50,927
so I'll talk to her later.

248
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:52,554
Okay then.

249
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:55,515
- Gi-suk, can you...
- Right, by the way,

250
00:16:57,142 --> 00:16:58,435
can I ask you a question?

251
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:00,061
Sure, go ahead.

252
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:04,190
Rumor has it that the man living
in this house is a vampire.

253
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:05,483
Is it true?

254
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:07,694
Goodness.

255
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,905
I can't believe I just said that.

256
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:15,118
- Goodness.
- A vampire? No way.

257
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:18,121
They must be joking, right?

258
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:22,500
Someone must be spreading rumors
because of the redevelopment.

259
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:25,086
I guess this is a sign
that things will work out.

260
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,467
Tell me about it. A vampire?

261
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,843
That's just absurd.

262
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:33,595
It's not true at all.

263
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:34,721
Right?

264
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:36,473
I knew it.

265
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,975
We'll get going then.

266
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:42,353
Please sign this agreement

267
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:44,147
and bring it to Daebak Butcher Shop.

268
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,064
Okay.

269
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:46,941
If she's not there,

270
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:48,860
you can come
to Osio Tailor Shop next door.

271
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:51,112
- I will.
- Come to Daebak or Osio.

272
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:53,698
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

273
00:17:58,453 --> 00:18:00,163
REDEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT

274
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:13,009
Dad, I'm heading out.

275
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:15,762
Are you going out
to look for Mr. Seon again?

276
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:18,598
I want some fresh air too.

277
00:18:19,224 --> 00:18:20,225
In-hae.

278
00:18:22,227 --> 00:18:24,979
Can we have a word?

279
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:27,941
Take a seat.

280
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:41,454
I don't know if I deserve to say this,

281
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:45,458
but I feel I must as your dad.

282
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:49,379
I'm thankful...

283
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:53,174
that Mr. Seon left.

284
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:55,969
Dad...

285
00:18:56,719 --> 00:19:00,765
I'm sure he didn't want to see you
blame yourself and suffer.

286
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:04,936
That may be why he chose to leave quietly.

287
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:09,148
In-hae.

288
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:13,152
You mean more to me
than anything else in the world.

289
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,739
I want you to date someone ordinary

290
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:18,616
and live happily.

291
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:22,203
It breaks my heart to see you suffer

292
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:24,831
because of Mr. Seon.

293
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:32,881
Let's sell the house and leave.

294
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:36,467
Let's not be held back
by vampires and whatnot any longer.

295
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:38,052
We'll go somewhere quiet and--

296
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:39,178
Dad.

297
00:19:39,262 --> 00:19:41,180
I have no intention of selling this house.

298
00:19:42,557 --> 00:19:43,516
In-hae.

299
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:46,185
I made so many memories in this house.

300
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:49,355
I'm going to wait for Woo-hyeol here.

301
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,191
I have to protect it no matter what.

302
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:08,207
PRE-FEASIBILITY REDEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT...

303
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:11,544
BADERICH SUPPORTS THE REDEVELOPMENT

304
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:14,339
THE NEW BEGINNING OF GONGCHEON-DONG

305
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:16,507
She turned the whole neighborhood
upside down.

306
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,468
What's her plan?

307
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:20,553
Shaded Oasis
will be affected by this, right?

308
00:20:22,305 --> 00:20:24,057
I should speak to In-hae.

309
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,199
Mr. Gu, I'm getting off here.

310
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:42,825
Here?

311
00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:49,540
In-hae.

312
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:54,671
Do-sik.

313
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:00,259
What brings you here?

314
00:21:01,052 --> 00:21:03,972
I see the neighborhood is in a mess
due to the redevelopment.

315
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:06,808
In-hae.

316
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:11,312
Why don't you sell the mansion?

317
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:13,940
No.

318
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:18,653
Some neighbors showed up

319
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:21,739
and asked my dad to sign
the redevelopment agreement.

320
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:25,243
But I don't intend on selling the mansion.

321
00:21:25,702 --> 00:21:26,869
I'm going to protect it.

322
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:31,040
I don't want you to suffer
because of it anymore.

323
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,043
You won't be able to handle
what will come next.

324
00:21:34,544 --> 00:21:37,005
I'm ready.

325
00:21:38,548 --> 00:21:39,799
But Do-sik,

326
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:42,510
I have to stay in that mansion.

327
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:46,389
Is it because of Seon Woo-hyeol?

328
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:49,058
You might die.

329
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:56,107
I will somehow find a way.

330
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:25,136
I think I'd be devastated

331
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:27,513
if you weren't in this world.

332
00:22:28,598 --> 00:22:30,016
I want you

333
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:32,477
to stay by my side for a long time

334
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:36,981
and never go anywhere.

335
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:54,207
But Do-sik...

336
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,794
I have to stay in that mansion.

337
00:23:00,254 --> 00:23:03,341
I will somehow find a way.

338
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:17,105
What is it?

339
00:23:17,188 --> 00:23:19,357
I said I didn't want
anything to do with you anymore.

340
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:24,153
I thought I should do you one last favor
before we part ways.

341
00:23:24,821 --> 00:23:25,905
What do you mean?

342
00:23:26,364 --> 00:23:27,406
I'll kill...

343
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:29,200
Seon Woo-hyeol for you.

344
00:23:30,535 --> 00:23:32,662
You said you have to
drink his blood to live.

345
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:34,872
So I'll kill him for you.

346
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:48,261
Come right over.

347
00:23:48,803 --> 00:23:51,514
I'm going to sweep this place up tonight.

348
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:57,061
Hey.

349
00:24:53,201 --> 00:24:54,911
Are you looking for a room?

350
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:57,371
Yes.

351
00:24:57,872 --> 00:24:59,874
I don't have a reservation,

352
00:24:59,957 --> 00:25:01,375
but do you have a room available?

353
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:03,544
Yes, please come in.

354
00:25:04,962 --> 00:25:06,631
How long will you be staying?

355
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:08,090
Before that,

356
00:25:09,467 --> 00:25:12,220
there's someone I want to meet.

357
00:25:13,721 --> 00:25:14,639
Sorry?

358
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:16,265
His name is Seon Woo-hyeol.

359
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:19,310
Is he not here?

360
00:25:37,578 --> 00:25:38,871
Who are you?

361
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:41,332
Why are you doing this to me?

362
00:25:41,415 --> 00:25:43,751
I told you I'm here
to meet Seon Woo-hyeol.

363
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:46,254
So tell me.

364
00:25:47,255 --> 00:25:49,757
Tell me where the hell Seon Woo-hyeol is!

365
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,133
I want to know too!

366
00:25:51,592 --> 00:25:53,302
I don't know anything!

367
00:25:53,386 --> 00:25:55,179
I have no idea where he is

368
00:25:55,263 --> 00:25:57,306
or what he's up to!

369
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:04,772
Go away.

370
00:26:06,649 --> 00:26:07,775
Go.

371
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:39,765
You think that can hurt me?

372
00:27:17,178 --> 00:27:18,137
How have you been?

373
00:27:22,058 --> 00:27:23,642
How dare you mess with her?

374
00:27:25,353 --> 00:27:27,396
Are you pissed
because I messed with your girl?

375
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:51,962
I thought you'd be weak
since your days are numbered,

376
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:53,547
but you've still got it.

377
00:27:56,967 --> 00:27:58,511
Even if I die when I do,

378
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:01,555
I'm taking you with me.

379
00:28:01,931 --> 00:28:03,432
That won't be easy.

380
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,836
No.

381
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:38,509
Butler Joo...

382
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:25,181
What the hell?

383
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:27,516
Where does his strength come from?

384
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,321
I'll be back to kill you.

385
00:30:12,061 --> 00:30:13,229
Woo-hyeol.

386
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:29,286
Where are you going again?

387
00:30:31,956 --> 00:30:34,875
You promised not to disappear
without telling me.

388
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:53,852
I'm sorry.

389
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:39,648
What's wrong? What happened?

390
00:31:40,524 --> 00:31:42,151
- I saw it.
- Saw what?

391
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:44,528
I clearly saw it with my own eyes.

392
00:31:44,612 --> 00:31:47,072
What is it that you saw?

393
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:52,536
The rumors were true.

394
00:31:52,995 --> 00:31:55,414
That mansion is a vampire den.

395
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:56,749
Vampire?

396
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:07,843
You don't even have anywhere to go.
Where were you?

397
00:32:15,643 --> 00:32:16,810
I was scared.

398
00:32:17,895 --> 00:32:20,814
While wandering the streets
looking for you,

399
00:32:22,483 --> 00:32:25,361
I was afraid
that I wouldn't be able to see you again.

400
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:29,907
When that guy attacked me earlier,

401
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,452
I kept thinking that you might appear.

402
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:38,165
Butler Joo.

403
00:32:38,749 --> 00:32:39,792
Why did you leave?

404
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:42,711
It's because of me, isn't it?

405
00:32:43,796 --> 00:32:46,090
You were going to die somewhere
where no one could find you.

406
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:48,133
Did you think I wouldn't know?

407
00:32:50,052 --> 00:32:52,012
I heard you can only become human

408
00:32:52,346 --> 00:32:54,098
if you suck me dry of my blood.

409
00:32:56,517 --> 00:32:58,435
Or else you'll die.

410
00:33:05,943 --> 00:33:06,902
I'm sorry.

411
00:33:10,114 --> 00:33:12,366
I didn't want you to suffer.

412
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:14,159
What...

413
00:33:15,536 --> 00:33:17,037
How can you say that?

414
00:33:18,872 --> 00:33:20,833
I've lived long enough.

415
00:33:22,668 --> 00:33:25,087
And because I met you,

416
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:28,549
I've been happier than ever.

417
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:31,343
Did you think
I'd thank you for doing that?

418
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:33,470
Don't you think this is selfish?

419
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:35,848
Has it ever occurred to you

420
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:38,267
that I might long for you
for the rest of my life

421
00:33:38,684 --> 00:33:40,060
just like you did?

422
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:47,985
I'm sorry.

423
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:55,743
Woo-hyeol.

424
00:33:57,327 --> 00:33:59,204
Let's find a way together.

425
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:01,498
Forget about dying.

426
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:04,126
I can't let you go like this.

427
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:12,551
Okay.

428
00:34:13,844 --> 00:34:14,803
I'll...

429
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:17,681
never leave you.

430
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:20,267
I promise.

431
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:23,312
Pinky promise.

432
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:32,279
Keep your word this time.

433
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:34,823
I will.

434
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:39,495
I want a copy of this promise.

435
00:34:46,043 --> 00:34:47,044
A copy?

436
00:34:54,927 --> 00:34:56,720
Let's head inside now.

437
00:34:57,346 --> 00:34:59,014
Everyone has been waiting for you.

438
00:35:02,935 --> 00:35:04,686
- Come on.
- Okay.

439
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:25,874
- Woo-hyeol!
- Woo-hyeol!

440
00:35:25,958 --> 00:35:28,001
How did you find him?

441
00:35:28,085 --> 00:35:29,837
How could you leave without a word?

442
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,505
We were worried sick.

443
00:35:32,798 --> 00:35:33,882
I'm sorry.

444
00:35:34,341 --> 00:35:35,884
You always say that.

445
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:39,388
We were so worried
that it was driving us crazy.

446
00:35:40,264 --> 00:35:41,306
I'm sorry.

447
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:45,143
I feel 100 years older because of you.

448
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:47,312
Look how much weight Seop has lost.

449
00:35:47,396 --> 00:35:48,605
Can you believe it?

450
00:35:50,566 --> 00:35:51,733
It's not true.

451
00:35:52,109 --> 00:35:54,069
But we can't live properly

452
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:57,364
if you leave us like that.

453
00:35:58,490 --> 00:35:59,700
I'm sorry.

454
00:36:01,577 --> 00:36:02,619
Woo-hyeol.

455
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:06,331
Anyway, I'm relieved you're back.

456
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:32,649
Dad?

457
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:35,777
Dad.

458
00:36:38,155 --> 00:36:39,698
In-hae.

459
00:36:41,909 --> 00:36:42,951
What's wrong?

460
00:36:43,452 --> 00:36:47,372
That man followed me here.

461
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:50,500
The vampire that locked me up

462
00:36:50,584 --> 00:36:52,711
came here to kill me.

463
00:37:01,845 --> 00:37:05,515
Dad, it's okay now. It's all over.

464
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:07,517
I don't think

465
00:37:08,352 --> 00:37:10,938
I can live in this house anymore.

466
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:42,511
Mr. Shin.

467
00:37:43,136 --> 00:37:44,304
Why are you drinking?

468
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:46,056
Do you want to join?

469
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:06,618
It's been over five years
since you joined the company, right?

470
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,454
You remember that?

471
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:14,710
How have you been putting up with
a boring boss like me all this time?

472
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:17,546
You know...

473
00:38:18,672 --> 00:38:20,257
that I'm always thankful, right?

474
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:23,010
That's what I should be saying.

475
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:27,014
You're the one

476
00:38:27,556 --> 00:38:30,017
who reached out to me and offered me a job

477
00:38:30,726 --> 00:38:32,102
when I was lost.

478
00:38:34,271 --> 00:38:36,606
You're right, I did.

479
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:39,484
I'm always willing to help you,
so just let me know.

480
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:42,738
It's reassuring to hear that.

481
00:38:43,363 --> 00:38:45,073
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

482
00:38:54,416 --> 00:38:55,459
Mr. Shin.

483
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:58,587
Is everything all right?

484
00:39:01,381 --> 00:39:03,759
I know that all this talk about vampires

485
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:05,469
must've been hard to believe.

486
00:39:07,429 --> 00:39:09,389
But your hard work

487
00:39:11,141 --> 00:39:12,225
has been a great help.

488
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:14,352
It's because you believed in me.

489
00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:17,773
I simply did what I had to do.

490
00:39:24,404 --> 00:39:25,739
Seon Woo-hyeol will die...

491
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:31,328
unless he sucks In-hae dry of her blood.

492
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,039
Sorry?

493
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:39,127
I think the time has come.

494
00:39:41,505 --> 00:39:42,464
Mr. Shin.

495
00:39:43,799 --> 00:39:45,759
It's something I have to put an end to.

496
00:39:54,351 --> 00:39:57,145
A total lunar eclipse takes place
when the moon is completely covered

497
00:39:57,229 --> 00:39:58,855
by the Earth's shadow.

498
00:39:58,939 --> 00:40:01,525
According to the astronomical observatory,

499
00:40:01,608 --> 00:40:06,655
a total lunar eclipse
is expected to occur in a week,

500
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:10,117
accompanied by a blood moon.

501
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,161
The day is finally here.

502
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,848
I've lived long enough.

503
00:40:33,306 --> 00:40:34,349
And...

504
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,853
because I met you,

505
00:40:39,146 --> 00:40:40,856
I've been happier than ever.

506
00:40:42,983 --> 00:40:44,442
He'll keep his promise.

507
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:58,665
Did you think
I'd thank you for doing that?

508
00:40:58,748 --> 00:41:00,792
Don't you think this is selfish?

509
00:41:01,168 --> 00:41:02,919
Has it ever occurred to you

510
00:41:03,003 --> 00:41:05,338
that I might long for you
for the rest of my life

511
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:07,257
just like you did?

512
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,106
Woo-hyeol,

513
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:24,399
are you feeling okay?

514
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:28,486
I'm afraid not.

515
00:41:29,779 --> 00:41:33,116
My heart aches more than I expected.

516
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:36,411
Serves you right.

517
00:41:37,287 --> 00:41:39,748
Hey, why would you say that?

518
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:42,834
Did you expect to be fine
after breaking our hearts?

519
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:44,669
What were we supposed to do

520
00:41:46,046 --> 00:41:47,297
after you left like that?

521
00:41:49,883 --> 00:41:50,717
Yes.

522
00:41:51,593 --> 00:41:52,469
You're right.

523
00:41:54,137 --> 00:41:55,555
It must've been tougher

524
00:41:56,723 --> 00:41:58,975
for you two and Butler Joo than me.

525
00:41:59,893 --> 00:42:01,853
I know how you must've felt.

526
00:42:02,395 --> 00:42:03,772
I do understand.

527
00:42:05,899 --> 00:42:07,150
But Woo-hyeol,

528
00:42:07,234 --> 00:42:08,860
it really hurts us

529
00:42:10,195 --> 00:42:11,655
if you disappear like that without a word.

530
00:42:15,617 --> 00:42:16,660
I'm sorry.

531
00:42:18,161 --> 00:42:19,246
It's fine.

532
00:42:20,163 --> 00:42:22,999
But you should give us time
to prepare ourselves

533
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,377
and accept everything.

534
00:42:54,364 --> 00:42:55,615
You're up early.

535
00:42:58,910 --> 00:42:59,828
Yes.

536
00:43:00,537 --> 00:43:03,707
I have a lot on my mind.

537
00:43:04,666 --> 00:43:06,209
You must be exhausted.

538
00:43:06,293 --> 00:43:07,460
Why didn't you get more sleep?

539
00:43:11,131 --> 00:43:13,967
I also have a lot on my mind.

540
00:43:16,553 --> 00:43:17,554
Right.

541
00:43:18,847 --> 00:43:20,265
I never got to thank you

542
00:43:21,391 --> 00:43:22,767
for the suit.

543
00:43:24,644 --> 00:43:26,104
Thank you for doing that.

544
00:43:27,314 --> 00:43:29,065
I really like it.

545
00:43:29,774 --> 00:43:31,568
I'm glad you like it.

546
00:43:33,486 --> 00:43:35,905
Thank you for yesterday.

547
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:40,118
In-hae would've been in danger
if it weren't for you.

548
00:43:41,036 --> 00:43:42,370
Don't mention it.

549
00:43:42,454 --> 00:43:43,705
I did what I had to do.

550
00:43:44,998 --> 00:43:48,293
I was reminded of what I'd been through
as soon as I saw him,

551
00:43:49,002 --> 00:43:50,503
so I couldn't do anything.

552
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:54,090
I understand.

553
00:43:55,508 --> 00:43:57,010
Don't blame yourself.

554
00:43:57,886 --> 00:44:00,430
Fortunately, Butler Joo is safe.

555
00:44:01,056 --> 00:44:02,515
I'm Butler Joo.

556
00:44:04,684 --> 00:44:08,021
All of this is my fault

557
00:44:08,104 --> 00:44:11,608
as I couldn't carry out my duties properly
as the last butler.

558
00:44:15,153 --> 00:44:19,074
Please let me leave this place
with my daughter.

559
00:44:20,867 --> 00:44:24,704
In-hae has no obligation
to carry out her duties as a butler.

560
00:44:33,922 --> 00:44:35,048
I don't need...

561
00:44:36,299 --> 00:44:38,176
a butler anymore.

562
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:42,972
Our 100 years are up,

563
00:44:45,767 --> 00:44:47,727
and I don't expect anything more from you,

564
00:44:47,811 --> 00:44:49,479
who sacrificed everything
to keep the promise.

565
00:44:51,898 --> 00:44:53,274
You have done enough.

566
00:44:54,901 --> 00:44:56,194
Thank you for everything.

567
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:05,078
I'm sorry to ask,

568
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:10,375
but could you do me one last favor?

569
00:45:13,837 --> 00:45:15,004
Please...

570
00:45:17,549 --> 00:45:18,800
stay in the mansion.

571
00:45:20,343 --> 00:45:22,095
My days are numbered.

572
00:45:24,013 --> 00:45:27,225
I want to spend my last moments...

573
00:45:29,853 --> 00:45:31,354
with In-hae.

574
00:45:44,659 --> 00:45:45,952
What's going on?

575
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:49,622
Attention.

576
00:45:50,206 --> 00:45:52,208
Attention, everyone!

577
00:45:54,169 --> 00:45:59,674
Gongcheon-dong is finally
going to be redeveloped.

578
00:46:00,341 --> 00:46:04,471
But that mansion
is getting in our way again.

579
00:46:06,306 --> 00:46:08,933
I know it's hard to believe
but in that house...

580
00:46:15,148 --> 00:46:16,274
In that house...

581
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:20,236
A non-human lives in that house.

582
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,655
- What are you saying?
- That's nonsense.

583
00:46:22,739 --> 00:46:24,491
- Don't be ridiculous.
- What do you even mean?

584
00:46:24,574 --> 00:46:26,493
Were you seeing things?

585
00:46:26,576 --> 00:46:29,454
I clearly saw it with my own eyes.

586
00:46:29,537 --> 00:46:30,413
That house...

587
00:46:31,664 --> 00:46:33,416
is a vampire den.

588
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:36,252
- Goodness. Vampires don't exist.
- Goodness.

589
00:46:36,336 --> 00:46:38,588
- Don't be ridiculous.
- That's absurd.

590
00:46:38,671 --> 00:46:40,965
Let's say you spotted a cockroach
in your house.

591
00:46:41,049 --> 00:46:42,383
That means your house is already

592
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:44,219
full of cockroaches.

593
00:46:44,302 --> 00:46:47,055
I already saw two of those things,
I mean, two men...

594
00:46:48,306 --> 00:46:49,766
Anyway, two of them!

595
00:46:50,058 --> 00:46:53,520
- What are you talking about?
- You're being ridiculous.

596
00:46:53,603 --> 00:46:55,230
All right, quiet down.

597
00:46:57,315 --> 00:46:59,609
Gongcheon-dong is faced with

598
00:46:59,692 --> 00:47:03,029
the greatest opportunity and danger
at the same time right now.

599
00:47:03,112 --> 00:47:06,407
Are you going to let vampires
ruin the redevelopment plans

600
00:47:06,491 --> 00:47:09,702
and have our neighborhood
labeled as haunted?

601
00:47:09,786 --> 00:47:12,121
- We can't let that happen!
- No way!

602
00:47:12,205 --> 00:47:14,415
If the house prices drop
and we lose our customers,

603
00:47:14,499 --> 00:47:16,543
how will we make ends meet?

604
00:47:16,626 --> 00:47:18,711
- You're right.
- Gosh!

605
00:47:18,795 --> 00:47:21,297
Then let's go and see for ourselves

606
00:47:21,381 --> 00:47:23,049
whether it's a vampire or human.

607
00:47:23,132 --> 00:47:24,884
- Right? We should find out, shouldn't we?
- Yes.

608
00:47:24,968 --> 00:47:27,428
- We should.
- Yes, we should.

609
00:47:27,512 --> 00:47:29,514
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

610
00:47:29,597 --> 00:47:32,225
- Follow me!
- Let's go!

611
00:47:32,308 --> 00:47:33,309
- This way.
- Come on.

612
00:47:33,393 --> 00:47:35,645
Let's make this redevelopment happen!

613
00:47:35,728 --> 00:47:38,106
- Let's go find out.
- Redevelopment!

614
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:40,108
- We'll see for ourselves.
- Let's check.

615
00:47:40,191 --> 00:47:42,110
- Let's go.
- Goodness.

616
00:47:50,201 --> 00:47:51,327
Woo-hyeol.

617
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:53,871
Are you feeling okay?

618
00:47:55,081 --> 00:47:57,125
- Yes.
- Should I get you some ox blood?

619
00:48:00,962 --> 00:48:02,922
Woo-hyeol, are you okay?

620
00:48:05,425 --> 00:48:06,342
Woo-hyeol!

621
00:48:12,724 --> 00:48:14,434
I need some rest.

622
00:48:14,976 --> 00:48:17,270
Okay, we'll take you inside.

623
00:48:17,937 --> 00:48:18,855
All right.

624
00:48:33,286 --> 00:48:36,205
I'll ask Rose to bring some blood packs.

625
00:48:36,664 --> 00:48:37,624
Thank you.

626
00:49:12,533 --> 00:49:13,826
This scar...

627
00:49:20,416 --> 00:49:22,627
Is he in critical condition?

628
00:49:28,675 --> 00:49:29,926
Butler Joo.

629
00:49:30,009 --> 00:49:30,968
She's in danger.

630
00:49:31,928 --> 00:49:33,096
Woo-hyeol,

631
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:34,472
I'm right here.

632
00:49:43,606 --> 00:49:45,108
I'm okay.

633
00:49:55,535 --> 00:49:56,577
What a relief.

634
00:49:57,995 --> 00:49:58,996
It was a dream.

635
00:50:00,206 --> 00:50:01,582
Don't worry.

636
00:50:03,584 --> 00:50:05,253
I'll stay by your side.

637
00:50:20,685 --> 00:50:22,437
Mr. Ox Blood, come outside!

638
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,105
Come outside!

639
00:50:24,188 --> 00:50:26,315
- Come out!
- Come on!

640
00:50:26,399 --> 00:50:28,484
- Someone's coming out.
- Who is she?

641
00:50:29,861 --> 00:50:31,112
What's going on?

642
00:50:31,571 --> 00:50:33,448
Is Mr. Ox Blood in there?

643
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:34,949
If he is, tell him to come outside.

644
00:50:35,616 --> 00:50:37,410
Why all of a sudden?

645
00:50:37,493 --> 00:50:38,578
We need to check something.

646
00:50:41,622 --> 00:50:44,584
I'm afraid he can't.
He's not feeling well today.

647
00:50:44,667 --> 00:50:45,960
Please leave.

648
00:50:50,298 --> 00:50:52,467
Are you saying a vampire is sick?

649
00:50:57,513 --> 00:51:01,058
Don't tell me you didn't know
Mr. Ox Blood's true identity.

650
00:51:03,978 --> 00:51:06,481
What on earth are you saying?

651
00:51:06,564 --> 00:51:07,482
Look at her.

652
00:51:07,565 --> 00:51:09,984
We know everything.
Don't try to play dumb.

653
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:11,194
Will you admit it...

654
00:51:12,153 --> 00:51:14,864
if I tell everyone what I saw yesterday?

655
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,242
Come out if you have nothing to hide!

656
00:51:18,326 --> 00:51:19,994
Why can't he come out?

657
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:23,790
Why are you the only one
against the redevelopment?

658
00:51:23,873 --> 00:51:25,249
- It's strange!
- Exactly!

659
00:51:25,333 --> 00:51:27,210
- Don't you agree?
- You're right!

660
00:51:27,293 --> 00:51:29,921
- What are you hiding?
- Tell him to come outside.

661
00:51:30,004 --> 00:51:32,215
Please stop disturbing our business

662
00:51:32,632 --> 00:51:33,883
and leave for today.

663
00:51:35,218 --> 00:51:38,262
- That rude little...
- My goodness.

664
00:51:38,346 --> 00:51:40,097
- My gosh.
- Unbelievable.

665
00:51:40,181 --> 00:51:43,309
Gi-suk, let's go home for today.

666
00:51:43,392 --> 00:51:44,936
Mr. Ox Blood is unwell.

667
00:51:45,019 --> 00:51:46,395
Let's come back some other time.

668
00:51:46,729 --> 00:51:49,857
We can't have a vampire among us.

669
00:51:49,941 --> 00:51:51,901
Leave this neighborhood!

670
00:51:51,984 --> 00:51:53,152
Because of you,

671
00:51:53,236 --> 00:51:55,738
the redevelopment fell through
and our house prices dropped!

672
00:51:55,822 --> 00:51:57,281
Darn it.

673
00:51:57,865 --> 00:51:59,325
Calm down.

674
00:51:59,408 --> 00:52:01,869
Everyone, let's leave for today.

675
00:52:01,953 --> 00:52:03,120
We can come back some other time.

676
00:52:03,204 --> 00:52:04,747
Come on, let's go.

677
00:52:04,831 --> 00:52:06,916
- Goodness me.
- Let's leave.

678
00:52:06,999 --> 00:52:08,543
- My gosh.
- We'll be back!

679
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:10,628
- How could she?
- She has no manners.

680
00:52:10,711 --> 00:52:12,880
How can she make us come back?

681
00:52:20,346 --> 00:52:22,098
Gi-suk, calm down.

682
00:52:22,557 --> 00:52:23,683
Come on.

683
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:26,102
How will we kick them out?

684
00:52:27,061 --> 00:52:29,730
I should've filmed yesterday's incident
on my phone.

685
00:52:29,814 --> 00:52:31,482
They can't lie if we have evidence.

686
00:52:31,566 --> 00:52:32,650
You're right.

687
00:52:32,733 --> 00:52:36,904
But based on
our interactions with him until now,

688
00:52:36,988 --> 00:52:40,741
Mr. Ox Blood didn't seem like a bad guy.

689
00:52:40,825 --> 00:52:42,577
Min-jae loves him too.

690
00:52:44,412 --> 00:52:46,581
Are you siding with a vampire?

691
00:52:46,664 --> 00:52:48,624
No, of course not!

692
00:52:48,708 --> 00:52:51,377
Get yourself together.
Min-jae might've been deceived.

693
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:04,015
Why did you want to see me?

694
00:53:04,223 --> 00:53:05,224
Are you okay?

695
00:53:05,892 --> 00:53:08,603
It seems like you're in trouble
because of the redevelopment.

696
00:53:10,062 --> 00:53:12,315
You can only hide the truth for so long.

697
00:53:12,732 --> 00:53:14,066
You should've been more careful.

698
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:19,280
The whole neighborhood knows now.
What will you do?

699
00:53:20,114 --> 00:53:23,200
I will never hand over the mansion.

700
00:53:24,535 --> 00:53:25,536
Really?

701
00:53:26,704 --> 00:53:28,789
Let's see how long you can hold out.

702
00:53:29,498 --> 00:53:30,499
Was it you?

703
00:53:31,959 --> 00:53:33,127
You told them?

704
00:53:33,544 --> 00:53:35,046
I told you to wait and see.

705
00:53:35,755 --> 00:53:36,923
Did you not take me seriously?

706
00:53:38,758 --> 00:53:40,885
No matter what you do,

707
00:53:41,636 --> 00:53:44,013
I'm going to protect this mansion
and Woo-hyeol.

708
00:53:54,941 --> 00:53:57,693
What do we do now?
The whole neighborhood knows.

709
00:53:59,028 --> 00:54:00,112
I think...

710
00:54:01,739 --> 00:54:03,157
we should leave.

711
00:54:04,325 --> 00:54:05,743
Why should you?

712
00:54:06,077 --> 00:54:07,745
It's not like you harmed anyone.

713
00:54:07,828 --> 00:54:10,164
You shouldn't be kicked out
just because you're vampires.

714
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:13,793
Are you sure we don't have to leave?

715
00:54:14,293 --> 00:54:17,964
We don't want to cause you trouble.

716
00:54:18,464 --> 00:54:20,174
This is a place of business after all.

717
00:54:20,633 --> 00:54:22,760
No one will want to stay here
if the word spreads.

718
00:54:23,719 --> 00:54:25,846
We'll find a way.

719
00:55:12,435 --> 00:55:14,478
What can I do for Butler Joo

720
00:55:15,604 --> 00:55:18,065
before I leave her?

721
00:55:34,457 --> 00:55:35,875
Why are you calling me so late?

722
00:55:42,048 --> 00:55:43,090
Okay.

723
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:45,718
Where should we meet?

724
00:56:29,428 --> 00:56:30,346
What is this about?

725
00:56:31,305 --> 00:56:33,182
Why did you want to meet at this hour?

726
00:56:33,516 --> 00:56:35,184
How far will you take this?

727
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:37,645
I saw everything

728
00:56:38,646 --> 00:56:40,314
that happened here.

729
00:56:41,857 --> 00:56:43,567
In-hae almost died because of you.

730
00:56:44,527 --> 00:56:45,986
How do you know about that?

731
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:47,863
How much longer
are you going to trouble her?

732
00:56:49,615 --> 00:56:50,950
Don't you feel bad?

733
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:55,371
What can you even do for her?

734
00:56:56,330 --> 00:56:58,207
You're a blood-sucking vampire.

735
00:56:58,290 --> 00:56:59,667
What can you do for her?

736
00:57:00,376 --> 00:57:01,460
Yes.

737
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:05,339
You're right.

738
00:57:07,049 --> 00:57:08,717
There's nothing I can do...

739
00:57:10,553 --> 00:57:12,429
for Butler Joo.

740
00:57:12,513 --> 00:57:14,181
- That's why--
- I'm glad you know.

741
00:57:27,987 --> 00:57:29,029
Then die.

742
00:57:41,584 --> 00:57:43,627
I understand...

743
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:48,757
your feelings for Butler Joo.

744
00:57:49,967 --> 00:57:52,219
But I can't die just yet.

745
00:57:53,846 --> 00:57:55,890
I must keep my promise to her.

746
00:58:53,447 --> 00:58:54,531
Woo-hyeol.

747
00:59:37,032 --> 00:59:39,952
HEARTBEAT

748
00:59:40,035 --> 00:59:43,080
Seon Woo-hyeol is going to die
because of you! What will you do now?

749
00:59:43,163 --> 00:59:44,999
How is that In-hae's fault?

750
00:59:45,082 --> 00:59:47,209
Why do you think I'm in this state?

751
00:59:47,293 --> 00:59:48,585
It's all your fault!

752
00:59:48,669 --> 00:59:50,421
You're willing to sacrifice your life

753
00:59:50,504 --> 00:59:52,172
for the human you love.

754
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:54,258
Take good care of Butler Joo.

755
00:59:54,633 --> 00:59:56,677
Why do you have this?

756
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:58,387
Does In-hae not know?

757
00:59:58,929 --> 01:00:01,974
I want to ride the cable car with you
at Namsan

758
01:00:02,057 --> 01:00:05,311
and take a walk in the first snow
holding hands with you.

759
01:00:07,104 --> 01:00:08,981
In-hae, I love you.
