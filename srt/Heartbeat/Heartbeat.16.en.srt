HEARTBEAT

2
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,298
ALL CHARACTERS, NAMES,
ORGANIZATIONS, GROUPS, EVENTS,

3
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,383
AND SETTINGS ARE FICTITIOUS
AND ANIMAL SAFETY GUIDELINES WERE FOLLOWED

4
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:53,721
Woo-hyeol.

5
00:01:02,021 --> 00:01:03,189
What's going on?

6
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:05,149
It's late.

7
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:12,490
Right.

8
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:17,453
I was asking him

9
00:01:18,621 --> 00:01:20,414
to take good care of the guest house.

10
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:21,874
No,

11
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:23,626
I'm the one who asked him to meet.

12
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:28,506
I was asking him to stop
putting you in danger and to leave.

13
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:37,348
Do-sik.

14
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,226
You have it all wrong.

15
00:01:42,186 --> 00:01:44,063
I don't know what this is about,

16
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:46,315
but it's late, so you should head home.

17
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:50,277
We'll talk some other time.

18
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:54,532
Let's go, Woo-hyeol.

19
00:02:09,672 --> 00:02:13,175
Why did you agree to meet him at this hour
when you're not even feeling well?

20
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:19,223
I panicked thinking you disappeared again.

21
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:20,391
I promised you...

22
00:02:22,226 --> 00:02:23,435
that I wouldn't leave you.

23
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:30,109
Don't let what Do-sik said get to you.

24
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:32,987
He's not wrong.

25
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:36,240
I did put you in danger.

26
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:37,825
That's absurd.

27
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:41,453
Do-sik

28
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:44,290
may not know me well,

29
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:49,336
but his feelings for you seem genuine.

00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:56,927
HEARTBEAT
FINALE

31
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:03,309
We haven't been able
to step outside since yesterday.

32
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:06,020
This is bad. We're also out of ox blood.

33
00:03:07,438 --> 00:03:10,649
What did we do so wrong
that we have to be stuck at home?

34
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:15,029
By the way, how are you feeling?

35
00:03:17,031 --> 00:03:20,117
I'm good. You don't need to worry.

36
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:24,622
You're not in the best condition,
but this just had to happen.

37
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:43,349
LEE MAN-HWI

38
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:46,101
What is it?

39
00:03:46,185 --> 00:03:47,186
Na Hae-won.

40
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,272
You still haven't given up
on that mansion, have you?

41
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:51,941
You're so persistent.

42
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:53,901
I give you that.

43
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:55,903
Mind your own business, will you?

44
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:57,988
This doesn't concern you anymore.

45
00:03:58,072 --> 00:03:59,239
It seems like

46
00:03:59,323 --> 00:04:02,743
the whole neighborhood is talking
about a vampire living in that mansion.

47
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:04,244
Were you the source?

48
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:06,080
The neighbors have a right to know.

49
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:08,207
The same goes for you.

50
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:09,833
You also have a right to know.

51
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:11,961
Go ahead. What is this about?

52
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:14,254
Seon Woo-hyeol will die soon.

53
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:18,801
What are you talking about?

54
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,803
Seon Woo-hyeol will die soon?

55
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:26,809
There are rumors in the neighborhood
about Seon Woo-hyeol's identity.

56
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:28,435
His identity?

57
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:30,854
Ms. Na seems to be the source.

58
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:35,567
What should we do?

59
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:37,820
Set up a meeting with her.

60
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,030
I'll go to her office tonight.

61
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:41,240
Yes, sir.

62
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:46,870
Sir, are you all right?

63
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:48,706
Yes, I'm fine.

64
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:50,332
I'll go get your medicine.

65
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:57,756
Gi-suk, are you going
to Shaded Oasis again?

66
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:00,426
I'll go every day until they move away.

67
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:02,886
We'll see who wins.

68
00:05:03,429 --> 00:05:06,223
While we're at it,
should we cover their front yard

69
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,100
with a truckload of garlic?

70
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:11,186
But are you sure Mr. Ox Blood

71
00:05:12,271 --> 00:05:14,690
is a vampire?

72
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:16,150
Do you not believe me?

73
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:18,944
I saw him with my own two eyes.

74
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:30,748
Do you have a moment?

75
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,460
You... It's true, isn't it?

76
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:37,880
You're that thing I saw, aren't you?

77
00:05:38,881 --> 00:05:40,632
- You're right.
- What the...

78
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:42,342
It was true!

79
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:44,178
I told you so.

80
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:49,391
But I'm not

81
00:05:49,475 --> 00:05:51,393
the monster you think I am.

82
00:05:51,477 --> 00:05:52,436
What?

83
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:57,608
I have lived in this neighborhood
longer than anyone

84
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,444
and love this place more than anyone.

85
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:03,197
The tailor shop that's been there
for generations

86
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:05,449
and the newly opened butcher shop

87
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:07,910
are all fond memories to me.

88
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,997
You have given me such precious memories

89
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:16,877
and protected this neighborhood.

90
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:20,089
So I'm truly grateful.

91
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,384
So?

92
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:27,846
What is it you want to say?

93
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:33,268
I'll be...

94
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:36,230
leaving the mansion soon.

95
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,857
Really?

96
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:40,317
So...

97
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:43,654
please...

98
00:06:45,114 --> 00:06:47,991
don't give the others a hard time
because of me.

99
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:53,330
Please.

100
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:58,752
Where's Seon Woo-hyeol?

101
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:00,879
What brings you here?

102
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,256
Why are you looking for him?

103
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:04,341
Is he in the basement?

104
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,968
What do you think you're doing?

105
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,386
Move.

106
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:08,637
He isn't here.

107
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,596
He went out.

108
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:16,562
Is it...

109
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:18,814
true?

110
00:07:19,398 --> 00:07:21,567
Do you have to die for him to live?

111
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,945
Do you have to die
for him to become human?

112
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:28,365
Will he die if he doesn't become human?

113
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,200
Is that all true?

114
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:37,499
So what now?

115
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,628
Seon Woo-hyeol is going to die
because of you! What will you do now?

116
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:44,506
The one

117
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:48,135
who's causing Woo-hyeol more pain

118
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:50,721
is you, not me.

119
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:53,390
- What?
- You're trying to take away

120
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,892
this mansion, which is all he has.

121
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:59,521
You made his life unbearable
by telling everyone he's a vampire

122
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:04,026
so that you could have your way.

123
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:08,363
I can't sit by
and watch him suffer anymore.

124
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:12,409
I'm ready to risk my life to protect him,

125
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:15,078
so don't come back here ever again.

126
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:18,332
You don't have the right to love him.

127
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:42,481
I know everything.

128
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:45,359
You must drink Joo In-hae's blood

129
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,486
to become human.

130
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:51,657
One must die for the other to live.

131
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:54,952
Joo In-hae said

132
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,204
she would risk her life

133
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,248
to protect you.

134
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:03,168
But love can't come before your life.

135
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,379
You must be alive to love.

136
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:07,256
It means nothing if you're dead.

137
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,304
There's love...

138
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:18,267
that one is willing to die for.

139
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:22,354
Live.

140
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,189
No matter what it takes.

141
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:28,026
Drink Joo In-hae's blood and become human.

142
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:52,801
Ms. Na was just here.

143
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:54,219
I know.

144
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:56,138
I ran into her on my way in.

145
00:09:57,139 --> 00:09:58,181
What did she say?

146
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,600
Did she say something to you?

147
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:05,022
I don't care what others say.

148
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:07,899
Because nothing matters more to me

149
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:10,277
than you right now.

150
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:17,576
If people keep bothering you,

151
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,579
how about you move away?

152
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:23,165
You can't go on like this.

153
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,923
I'm the owner of this mansion

154
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:33,550
and also the guest house.

155
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:36,762
You don't have to worry about anything.

156
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,482
Are you the one

157
00:10:49,358 --> 00:10:50,901
who revealed Mr. Seon's identity?

158
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,737
- What if I did?
- In addition to In-hae's father--

159
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,614
I told you I had nothing to do with that.

160
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:58,033
Are you now going after In-hae too?

161
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,870
I'm going to do whatever I can

162
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:04,539
since Woo-hyeol matters to me the most.

163
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,627
Do you think love
is a piece of property you can obtain

164
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,170
by persistently chasing after it?

165
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:12,923
Seon Woo-hyeol might die
because of Joo In-hae.

166
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,133
So how can I just sit back?

167
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:16,635
How is that In-hae's fault?

168
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:21,306
Unlike a certain someone,
I don't give up easily.

169
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:23,225
Do you believe that's love?

170
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:26,228
What's so great about love anyway

171
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:28,230
that makes you want to die for it?

172
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:36,446
Would you look at this?

173
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:38,615
Here we all are.

174
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:39,866
What are you doing here?

175
00:11:43,245 --> 00:11:46,790
You should pay up
for my high-quality intel.

176
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:48,583
Where's my money?

177
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:50,752
Have you lost your mind?

178
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:59,636
I told you Seon Woo-hyeol is going to die
unless he drinks Joo In-hae's blood.

179
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,267
You're the one who told her?

180
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:07,894
What are you playing at again?

181
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,229
That's right.

182
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:12,149
Seon Woo-hyeol has been
screwing up things for me lately.

183
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:18,029
Cut the crap and leave.

184
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,323
You kept me close when I was useful,

185
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:24,411
but now that you don't need me,
you want me gone. Is that it?

186
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:25,871
You're one to talk.

187
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:28,748
You're ready to follow anyone's orders

188
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,500
as long as you get paid.

189
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:39,509
Even worthless humans look down on me now.

190
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:40,844
You should leave.

191
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:44,181
You called off our deal as you like.

192
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:46,892
Why? Do you also not need me anymore?

193
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:50,187
Hold on.

194
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,688
What is he talking about?

195
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:53,607
What deal?

196
00:12:54,316 --> 00:12:56,359
Oh, you didn't know?

197
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:59,196
He's out for Seon Woo-hyeol's blood.

198
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:06,536
He needs the blood of a half-vampire
to escape the fate of dying young

199
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:11,541
that has been passed down in his family
or something.

200
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,338
Right?

201
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:18,590
Is that true?

202
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:23,220
Leave while I ask nicely.

203
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,096
Humans.

204
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:30,769
You swallow what's sweet
and spit out what's bitter.

205
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:35,315
You attribute your good fortune
to yourselves

206
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:37,609
and blame others for your misfortune.

207
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:39,361
You're the one who blew your chance.

208
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,292
Why do you think I'm in this state?

209
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,712
It's because you two complicated my life.

210
00:13:58,338 --> 00:13:59,381
What?

211
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:00,966
If it weren't for you,

212
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:05,053
I wouldn't have gotten involved
with Seon Woo-hyeol.

213
00:14:07,556 --> 00:14:10,183
This happened
because I tried to capture him for you.

214
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:12,686
It's all your fault!

215
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:18,733
Lee Man-hwi.

216
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:27,909
Look closely.

217
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:30,203
This is who I really am.

218
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:45,510
You...

219
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:32,641
What was that?

220
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:34,476
That's what vampires are like.

221
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:40,106
Even Seon Woo-hyeol
isn't all that different from him.

222
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:48,448
You should leave

223
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,575
before things get uglier.

224
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:16,059
Oh, you didn't know?

225
00:16:16,393 --> 00:16:18,687
He's out for Seon Woo-hyeol's blood.

226
00:16:44,546 --> 00:16:45,880
Gi-suk!

227
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:48,550
Did you hear the news?

228
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:49,634
What news?

229
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:51,594
The redevelopment...

230
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:53,763
is going to be canceled.

231
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:56,349
What?

232
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,268
Why? By whom?

233
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,812
I need to talk to Ms. Na.

234
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:02,439
Call her.

235
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:05,608
We still have some time
with those agreement forms, don't we?

236
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:06,776
Yes, we do.

237
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:12,031
Your call cannot be connected.
You will be redirected to voicemail.

238
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:14,534
- You will be charged after...
- Is she not picking up?

239
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:16,035
What now?

240
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:22,083
Excuse me.

241
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:33,803
For generations,
my family had the duty of protecting

242
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:36,181
that mansion.

243
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:41,311
I was hoping to take this opportunity
to finally sell the property and move on,

244
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:45,774
so to think that we caused
the redevelopment to fall through again

245
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:48,234
makes my heart heavy.

246
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:50,361
There's no need to rub it in.

247
00:17:50,862 --> 00:17:51,905
I'm truly sorry.

248
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:57,452
There may be no point
in saying this to you now,

249
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,288
but I wanted to clear up
any misunderstandings

250
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:01,956
you have about Mr. Seon.

251
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,792
Misunderstandings? There are none.

252
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:06,169
If it weren't for Mr. Seon,

253
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,004
I wouldn't be alive right now.

254
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,509
Another vampire had kidnapped me
and kept me in confinement,

255
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,053
and it was Mr. Seon who saved my life.

256
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:16,137
You...

257
00:18:16,888 --> 00:18:18,389
You were kidnapped?

258
00:18:18,473 --> 00:18:19,516
That's right.

259
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:21,768
What you saw that day

260
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:25,647
was Mr. Seon rescuing my daughter
from danger.

261
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:29,526
Mr. Seon isn't a monster.

262
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:34,322
One could say he's a vampire
who's more humane than humans themselves.

263
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:01,850
Woo-hyeol.

264
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:04,102
What are you doing?

265
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:17,198
Sang-hae, this is for you.

266
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:20,785
And Dong-seop, this is for you.

267
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:24,497
No, Woo-hyeol. I don't need it.

268
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:27,041
Right. You look way better in this coat.

269
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:28,126
No.

270
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:31,838
Everything in this room...

271
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:34,799
is now yours.

272
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:40,638
Thank you for everything.

273
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:57,030
Hello?

274
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:17,634
Have you been waiting long?

275
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:19,260
No, I just got here.

276
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:28,728
I'm leaving for the US today.

277
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:33,483
I'll probably be gone a while
this time around.

278
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:37,612
So I asked you here to say goodbye.

279
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:40,073
You could've just left,

280
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:43,993
but you came to say goodbye.

281
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:50,583
I really enjoyed my time in Korea

282
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:54,837
thanks to you.

283
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:58,841
Just looking at you made me happy.

284
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:02,929
Maybe that's why I couldn't give up

285
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:05,723
on the mansion and you.

286
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:09,352
But...

287
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:14,774
things didn't go my way,
and it tortured me.

288
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:19,862
You may still be
too young to realize this,

289
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:22,448
but you'll eventually learn...

290
00:21:24,534 --> 00:21:28,830
that things don't always go your way.

291
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,334
And that it's better that way.

292
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:38,965
I can't say the words bring any comfort.

293
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:47,265
I believed I had everything
I had ever wanted,

294
00:21:48,725 --> 00:21:50,977
but I envied someone
for the first time in my life.

295
00:21:52,854 --> 00:21:54,313
Loving someone so much

296
00:21:55,273 --> 00:21:58,067
that you'd even sacrifice your life
to protect them.

297
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:02,655
I hope...

298
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,241
I'll get to experience that

299
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:07,618
at least once in my life.

300
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:08,953
I'm sure...

301
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,123
you will.

302
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:16,836
Mr. Seon,

303
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:18,921
listen carefully to what I'm about to say.

304
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:23,885
Shin Do-sik is after your blood.

305
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:27,138
He needs the blood of a half-vampire

306
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:29,432
to escape the fate of dying young.

307
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:32,935
Watch out for him.

308
00:22:37,774 --> 00:22:40,693
I can't believe
I'm still concerned about you.

309
00:22:42,737 --> 00:22:43,863
Thank you.

310
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:46,657
I appreciate your concern.

311
00:22:50,495 --> 00:22:51,662
That's all...

312
00:22:53,206 --> 00:22:54,665
I have to say,

313
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:56,209
so I'll get going.

314
00:22:58,086 --> 00:22:59,170
Take care.

315
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:14,936
Goodbye.

316
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:22,527
- Mr. Shin.
- Yes?

317
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:23,820
Seon Woo-hyeol is here.

318
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:26,280
Seon Woo-hyeol?

319
00:23:37,792 --> 00:23:38,960
What a surprise.

320
00:23:39,961 --> 00:23:42,213
REFRESH REAL ESTATE CONSULTING

321
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:43,381
What brings you by?

322
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:47,260
I've always wanted to come here

323
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:49,303
and see for myself

324
00:23:50,847 --> 00:23:52,515
how successful you are.

325
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:08,906
Actually,

326
00:24:10,158 --> 00:24:12,451
I came by to confirm something.

327
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:14,954
Confirm what?

328
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:16,664
I heard

329
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:20,376
you were seeking the blood
of a half-vampire.

330
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:23,087
Is that true?

331
00:24:42,857 --> 00:24:45,026
You're really running out of time now.

332
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:54,827
Are you still angry with me?

333
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:02,001
- No.
- It was foolish of me.

334
00:25:03,753 --> 00:25:04,795
I apologize.

335
00:25:05,463 --> 00:25:08,299
I just came by to say goodbye.

336
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:11,761
Don't tell me

337
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:14,972
you were going to leave
without saying goodbye to me.

338
00:25:20,937 --> 00:25:22,146
Thank you for everything.

339
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:26,442
I was only able to make it this far
thanks to you.

340
00:25:28,486 --> 00:25:29,820
I owe it all to you.

341
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:32,406
I now know

342
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,743
why people prefer cats

343
00:25:36,911 --> 00:25:38,037
over dogs.

344
00:25:52,843 --> 00:25:55,513
You were...

345
00:25:56,806 --> 00:25:58,349
like a father to me.

346
00:26:00,101 --> 00:26:01,227
Thank you.

347
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:04,563
There's one thing

348
00:26:05,648 --> 00:26:07,358
I must say to you.

349
00:26:09,318 --> 00:26:10,528
You should know

350
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:16,075
that I have never met a vampire
more humane than you.

351
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:19,578
I'm saying I'm truly impressed.

352
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:23,332
You risked your own life

353
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:26,752
by lying inside a hawthorn coffin
for 100 years

354
00:26:27,003 --> 00:26:29,088
just to experience love
that makes your heart beat.

355
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:31,173
And now, you're willing
to sacrifice your life

356
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,510
for the human you love.

357
00:26:37,847 --> 00:26:39,515
I have lived 1 000 years,

358
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:43,102
but you taught me such love could exist,

359
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:45,855
and I am grateful.

360
00:26:49,025 --> 00:26:50,026
No.

361
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,572
I should be thanking you.

362
00:27:30,066 --> 00:27:31,484
Can I come in?

363
00:27:33,903 --> 00:27:34,862
Sure.

364
00:27:43,621 --> 00:27:45,456
How are you feeling?

365
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:49,251
I'm good.

366
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:52,296
I'm glad things worked out
for Shaded Oasis.

367
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:56,634
All I need to do now
is focus on running it well.

368
00:28:00,513 --> 00:28:03,557
There's something you must do before that.

369
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:04,934
Which is?

370
00:28:05,393 --> 00:28:06,435
Let's...

371
00:28:08,229 --> 00:28:09,271
go on a trip.

372
00:28:11,774 --> 00:28:13,192
A trip?

373
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,078
Dad, I'll get going.

374
00:28:24,412 --> 00:28:25,788
Please watch over Shaded Oasis.

375
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:26,956
All right.

376
00:28:27,665 --> 00:28:30,709
Don't worry about things here
and have a good time.

377
00:28:32,253 --> 00:28:33,629
And...

378
00:28:35,256 --> 00:28:37,800
call me right away if anything happens.

379
00:28:38,509 --> 00:28:39,552
I'm not a kid.

380
00:28:39,969 --> 00:28:41,053
Don't worry.

381
00:28:41,137 --> 00:28:42,471
All right. See you later then.

382
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:44,598
- I'm off.
- Okay.

383
00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:02,825
I'll get going.

384
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:05,744
Right, Woo-hyeol.

385
00:29:05,828 --> 00:29:06,704
All right.

386
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:08,789
Are you heading out?

387
00:29:11,292 --> 00:29:12,585
I should before the sun sets.

388
00:29:12,668 --> 00:29:13,961
Right.

389
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:20,259
Aren't you going to say goodbye?

390
00:29:23,471 --> 00:29:25,222
Seop, don't just stand there.

391
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:27,099
Woo-hyeol's leaving.

392
00:29:27,183 --> 00:29:29,101
Look him in the eye and say goodbye.

393
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:35,733
But he's leaving

394
00:29:36,734 --> 00:29:38,068
and never coming back.

395
00:29:44,658 --> 00:29:46,744
Even after 100 years or 200,

396
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:50,789
he won't ever come back.

397
00:29:57,171 --> 00:29:59,173
I really didn't want to cry.

398
00:29:59,256 --> 00:30:00,090
I...

399
00:30:02,676 --> 00:30:06,305
I was going to send him off with a smile,
but you ruined it.

400
00:30:12,228 --> 00:30:13,312
Sang-hae.

401
00:30:14,522 --> 00:30:15,731
Dong-seop.

402
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:17,358
I believe...

403
00:30:18,651 --> 00:30:20,528
you two will do well without me.

404
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:24,031
Just like you did

405
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:26,492
while I was asleep for 100 years.

406
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:28,786
I believe in you.

407
00:30:30,788 --> 00:30:31,872
You'll do well.

408
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,918
Woo-hyeol, there's something
I never got to tell you.

409
00:30:37,211 --> 00:30:38,254
I was

410
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:43,217
deeply touched by how you tried
to become human for so long

411
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:45,844
and even risked your life for it.

412
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:48,597
I mean it.

413
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:52,309
I will always love and admire you.

414
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:58,190
Even in my absence,

415
00:31:00,901 --> 00:31:02,486
take good care of Butler Joo.

416
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:09,868
Thank you, guys.

417
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:19,772
Who knew I'd come to a beach with you?

418
00:32:21,315 --> 00:32:22,358
Tell me about it.

419
00:32:23,901 --> 00:32:25,486
It's nice being here with you.

420
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:29,156
Since we came to a beach this time,
why don't we go to the mountains next?

421
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:33,369
There are so many things
I want to do with you.

422
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:37,206
I want to ride the cable car with you
at Namsan,

423
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:40,626
travel abroad with you,

424
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:44,463
and take a walk in the first snow
holding hands with you.

425
00:32:50,636 --> 00:32:51,637
What is it?

426
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:54,390
I'm just happy.

427
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:56,725
I'm happy...

428
00:33:00,521 --> 00:33:01,897
to be here with you.

429
00:33:04,108 --> 00:33:06,443
Then how about this?

430
00:33:40,853 --> 00:33:42,187
Is that supposed to be me?

431
00:33:45,149 --> 00:33:46,817
Yes, it's you.

432
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:50,195
Why? You don't like it?

433
00:33:54,408 --> 00:33:56,744
What on earth are you drawing?

434
00:33:57,536 --> 00:33:59,246
It's not done yet.

435
00:34:00,873 --> 00:34:01,999
Well, this...

436
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:10,758
I'll draw it again.

437
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:13,802
Let me back up a bit.

438
00:34:14,595 --> 00:34:16,013
I'll draw you again as well.

439
00:34:30,152 --> 00:34:31,403
Let's take a photo together.

440
00:34:32,321 --> 00:34:34,615
- A photo?
- To commemorate our first trip.

441
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:40,829
Here.

442
00:34:42,706 --> 00:34:44,124
One, two, three.

443
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:53,008
Do you want to see them?

444
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:54,468
Sure.

445
00:35:29,378 --> 00:35:32,339
I thought about it thousands of times.

446
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:37,511
What would've happened
had I not opened the coffin

447
00:35:37,928 --> 00:35:38,971
one day early?

448
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:42,766
If you had become human,

449
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:46,687
you wouldn't be suffering right now.

450
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:52,568
If that were the case,

451
00:35:53,944 --> 00:35:55,654
we wouldn't have met.

452
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,449
I felt angry

453
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:01,952
and wronged at first.

454
00:36:03,453 --> 00:36:04,913
But come to think of it,

455
00:36:05,372 --> 00:36:08,000
it was all for the best.

456
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:12,588
If you hadn't woken me up

457
00:36:13,881 --> 00:36:14,965
and if we hadn't

458
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:18,218
had the chance to spend time together,

459
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:23,348
I wouldn't have learned about love.

460
00:36:26,268 --> 00:36:28,228
You're the one who saved me.

461
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:31,189
Thanks to you,

462
00:36:31,273 --> 00:36:33,567
I'm living a life
that makes my heart beat.

463
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,571
Likewise.

464
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:39,907
Thanks to you,

465
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:42,409
I now know what love
that makes your heart beat feels like.

466
00:36:44,912 --> 00:36:45,871
Thank you.

467
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:51,251
Thank you.

468
00:36:53,003 --> 00:36:55,213
Thank you for showing up in my life.

469
00:36:57,257 --> 00:37:00,135
For teaching me what it means to love

470
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:02,054
and be loved.

471
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:08,769
In-hae,

472
00:37:10,854 --> 00:37:11,897
I love you.

473
00:37:17,694 --> 00:37:19,237
I love you too, Woo-hyeol.

474
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,220
Why don't we go see the stars?

475
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:45,055
The stars?

476
00:37:45,138 --> 00:37:48,225
There's a stargazing spot
not far from here.

477
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:56,608
Woo-hyeol, are you all right?

478
00:38:06,493 --> 00:38:07,494
I'm fine.

479
00:38:08,829 --> 00:38:09,830
Let's go.

480
00:38:12,082 --> 00:38:15,168
No, let's call it a day for now.

481
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:17,087
Come on.

482
00:38:19,339 --> 00:38:20,382
Watch your step.

483
00:38:47,034 --> 00:38:48,118
Woo-hyeol.

484
00:38:49,244 --> 00:38:51,496
Stop hurting and wake up.

485
00:39:14,895 --> 00:39:17,481
Drink my blood and remember me.

486
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:23,403
I will come find you.

487
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:30,869
Are you not afraid of me?

488
00:39:32,037 --> 00:39:34,081
I'm not that afraid of you.

489
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:37,501
If you wanted to kill me,
you would've done so already.

490
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:40,253
Rather, you saved me from death.

491
00:39:40,337 --> 00:39:41,338
What would happen

492
00:39:41,421 --> 00:39:45,050
if I really was her in my former life?

493
00:39:46,843 --> 00:39:47,969
Hae-sun.

494
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:51,348
Would you fall in love with me?

495
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,036
It was you.

496
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,168
You found me.

497
00:41:02,377 --> 00:41:03,420
In-hae.

498
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:06,298
Be happy.

499
00:42:01,937 --> 00:42:03,563
I'm sorry I couldn't keep my promise.

500
00:42:40,016 --> 00:42:41,268
Does everyone

501
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:44,854
feel the same way in the face of death?

502
00:42:47,023 --> 00:42:48,024
Mr. Seon.

503
00:43:00,537 --> 00:43:03,123
Where's In-hae?

504
00:43:03,707 --> 00:43:04,791
She's asleep...

505
00:43:06,251 --> 00:43:07,335
back at the lodge.

506
00:43:07,419 --> 00:43:09,004
Does she not know...

507
00:43:10,672 --> 00:43:12,590
that today is the day?

508
00:43:14,759 --> 00:43:16,428
Before the blood moon rises,

509
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:17,929
take my life

510
00:43:18,888 --> 00:43:20,056
and drink my blood.

511
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:25,186
If my blood can free you of the curse,

512
00:43:27,814 --> 00:43:28,940
then go ahead.

513
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:36,114
I've lived for very long,

514
00:43:39,326 --> 00:43:42,454
and I've witnessed countless deaths.

515
00:43:44,998 --> 00:43:46,124
However,

516
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:50,211
I've never thought about my own death.

517
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:54,215
Dying this way...

518
00:43:57,385 --> 00:43:59,262
won't be too bad of a death.

519
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:05,185
All I want

520
00:44:06,394 --> 00:44:07,395
is for Butler Joo,

521
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:09,147
I mean, In-hae

522
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:11,983
to be happy.

523
00:44:14,611 --> 00:44:15,945
Even when I'm gone,

524
00:44:17,447 --> 00:44:18,740
I hope

525
00:44:20,158 --> 00:44:21,493
she will always

526
00:44:23,244 --> 00:44:25,497
be surrounded by people
who love and care about her.

527
00:44:26,831 --> 00:44:28,583
That's the last thing...

528
00:44:31,211 --> 00:44:32,796
I can do for her

529
00:44:34,756 --> 00:44:35,840
before I leave.

530
00:44:42,514 --> 00:44:43,640
Please take good care

531
00:44:44,933 --> 00:44:46,142
of In-hae.

532
00:44:47,977 --> 00:44:49,312
In-hae was right.

533
00:44:50,563 --> 00:44:51,564
You're...

534
00:44:52,649 --> 00:44:53,775
a good man.

535
00:45:09,791 --> 00:45:11,084
There isn't much time.

536
00:45:13,461 --> 00:45:14,546
Let's begin.

537
00:45:51,291 --> 00:45:52,333
Woo-hyeol!

538
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:13,271
No.

539
00:46:15,607 --> 00:46:16,941
No!

540
00:46:20,069 --> 00:46:21,905
Woo-hyeol!

541
00:46:21,988 --> 00:46:23,031
Woo-hyeol...

542
00:46:23,448 --> 00:46:25,366
Woo-hyeol, why?

543
00:46:28,411 --> 00:46:29,496
In-hae.

544
00:46:32,624 --> 00:46:36,252
I really wanted to be by your side
for a long time.

545
00:46:38,296 --> 00:46:41,174
You can't leave me like this.

546
00:46:44,219 --> 00:46:45,261
Woo-hyeol!

547
00:46:46,054 --> 00:46:47,222
Woo-hyeol, no.

548
00:46:47,639 --> 00:46:49,807
You can't die like this.

549
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:52,727
Stay with me, Woo-hyeol.

550
00:46:58,399 --> 00:47:00,276
We'll be able to meet again.

551
00:47:04,113 --> 00:47:06,032
And I'll be the one to find you this time.

552
00:47:27,804 --> 00:47:30,723
Woo-hyeol...

553
00:47:34,811 --> 00:47:36,396
Woo-hyeol...

554
00:47:36,896 --> 00:47:38,273
Woo-hyeol!

555
00:47:39,065 --> 00:47:40,525
No, Woo-hyeol!

556
00:47:41,401 --> 00:47:42,527
Woo-hyeol!

557
00:47:43,194 --> 00:47:45,822
You promised to stay by my side!

558
00:47:46,239 --> 00:47:48,116
No, Woo-hyeol.

559
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:50,618
Please wake up.

560
00:47:51,953 --> 00:47:53,663
Wake up...

561
00:47:58,501 --> 00:48:00,253
Woo-hyeol, no!

562
00:48:15,685 --> 00:48:17,020
"Seon Woo-hyeol."

563
00:48:18,396 --> 00:48:20,398
"He was our good friend."

564
00:48:22,275 --> 00:48:25,028
"He was our leader."

565
00:48:26,446 --> 00:48:28,031
"After his slumber of 100 years,

566
00:48:28,948 --> 00:48:32,327
he gladly offered us guidance again

567
00:48:32,535 --> 00:48:34,370
as our big brother."

568
00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:40,084
"Even though his desperate wish
to become human never came true,

569
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:44,380
he lived on this earth as a vampire
who was more humane than humans."

570
00:48:49,427 --> 00:48:51,262
"Even though he is no longer with us,

571
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:53,431
we will...

572
00:48:56,017 --> 00:48:58,102
remember him forever."

573
00:49:03,441 --> 00:49:04,400
Seop.

574
00:49:05,985 --> 00:49:07,904
How will we live without him?

575
00:49:08,404 --> 00:49:11,282
We will wait for his return

576
00:49:12,909 --> 00:49:15,203
for many centuries to come.

577
00:49:16,371 --> 00:49:17,538
Woo-hyeol,

578
00:49:18,247 --> 00:49:19,248
don't worry.

579
00:49:19,916 --> 00:49:22,460
I'll take good care of these losers,

580
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,880
so don't worry and rest in peace.

581
00:49:28,633 --> 00:49:29,717
You should say a few words

582
00:49:30,802 --> 00:49:32,387
before saying goodbye to him.

583
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:40,353
Thank you

584
00:49:41,187 --> 00:49:43,314
for bringing me

585
00:49:44,065 --> 00:49:45,108
back together with In-hae.

586
00:49:46,359 --> 00:49:48,528
I hope you will be reborn

587
00:49:48,611 --> 00:49:50,613
as a human with a beating heart
in your next life

588
00:49:51,823 --> 00:49:56,119
and love to your heart's content.

589
00:50:00,623 --> 00:50:01,791
Woo-hyeol.

590
00:50:06,796 --> 00:50:09,382
Thank you for coming into my life.

591
00:50:19,767 --> 00:50:21,394
When you called out for me,

592
00:50:22,812 --> 00:50:24,689
it felt like I was being rescued

593
00:50:25,314 --> 00:50:26,941
from a dark pit.

594
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,988
Knowing that someone was waiting for me

595
00:50:32,321 --> 00:50:34,657
and the fact that it was you

596
00:50:35,992 --> 00:50:37,368
overwhelmed me.

597
00:50:41,414 --> 00:50:42,790
Because I met you,

598
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:46,002
I've been happier than ever.

599
00:50:49,172 --> 00:50:50,173
In-hae,

600
00:50:53,301 --> 00:50:54,385
I love you.

601
00:50:57,764 --> 00:50:59,724
I will cherish

602
00:51:00,516 --> 00:51:02,602
our memories forever.

603
00:51:08,483 --> 00:51:09,567
I love you.

604
00:52:02,286 --> 00:52:03,287
Welcome.

605
00:52:03,371 --> 00:52:04,705
Are you looking for a room?

606
00:52:13,005 --> 00:52:14,674
I came by to deliver something

607
00:52:14,757 --> 00:52:16,259
on Seon Woo-hyeol's behalf.

608
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:18,845
Seon Woo-hyeol?

609
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:35,528
Who are you

610
00:52:36,237 --> 00:52:38,447
and why do you have this?

611
00:52:38,739 --> 00:52:40,032
I watched over Woo-hyeol

612
00:52:40,741 --> 00:52:42,743
for a long time.

613
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:47,540
When there were talks of redevelopment
a while ago,

614
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:50,793
many people seemed
to have their eyes on this mansion.

615
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:53,129
So I hid the gold someplace safe.

616
00:52:54,046 --> 00:52:56,173
You're the one who stole all the gold?

617
00:52:56,716 --> 00:52:58,467
What do you mean stole?

618
00:52:58,885 --> 00:53:01,470
I just hid it someplace
out of other people's reach.

619
00:53:01,971 --> 00:53:03,097
Whatever you say.

620
00:53:04,974 --> 00:53:07,018
Anyway, I left the gold at--

621
00:53:12,231 --> 00:53:13,691
What are you doing?

622
00:53:16,694 --> 00:53:19,155
Tell me later.

623
00:53:20,114 --> 00:53:21,532
After I become human.

624
00:53:21,782 --> 00:53:22,909
What? Why?

625
00:53:24,076 --> 00:53:25,161
Right now,

626
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:29,206
I need a reason to stay with Butler Joo.

627
00:53:30,875 --> 00:53:32,627
Once I pay off my debt,

628
00:53:33,753 --> 00:53:36,714
I will have no excuse to be with her.

629
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:47,433
My gosh, Woo-hyeol.

630
00:53:48,392 --> 00:53:51,437
And with this,
he has finally paid off his debt.

631
00:54:19,882 --> 00:54:21,092
Please enjoy.

632
00:54:21,175 --> 00:54:23,803
Wow. I haven't seen
these retro-style dishes in forever.

633
00:54:23,886 --> 00:54:24,845
Right?

634
00:54:26,347 --> 00:54:28,099
This tastes just like it did
in the old days.

635
00:54:28,182 --> 00:54:29,225
- Really?
- Yes.

636
00:54:29,475 --> 00:54:31,727
Would you like some more pickled radish?

637
00:54:31,811 --> 00:54:36,732
OUR GRANDMA'S TTEOKBOKKI

638
00:54:36,816 --> 00:54:38,317
- Thank you.
- Please enjoy.

639
00:54:38,567 --> 00:54:40,194
- Let me know if you want more.
- Okay.

640
00:54:45,032 --> 00:54:46,033
Dong-seop.

641
00:54:47,576 --> 00:54:49,078
You have so many customers.

642
00:54:49,912 --> 00:54:51,372
You're doing much better than before.

643
00:54:51,455 --> 00:54:53,124
- I know.
- Right?

644
00:54:53,582 --> 00:54:54,917
- This is nice.
- It is.

645
00:54:55,001 --> 00:54:57,545
Then again, who doesn't miss
their grandma's cooking?

646
00:54:58,045 --> 00:55:01,132
This is all thanks to the gold
Woo-hyeol left us.

647
00:55:01,924 --> 00:55:05,469
Sang-hae, don't just spend your money.

648
00:55:05,553 --> 00:55:07,096
You should save up and live diligently.

649
00:55:07,179 --> 00:55:09,765
I don't want you whining in 100 years
about not having enough money

650
00:55:09,849 --> 00:55:11,058
to pay the Red Cross.

651
00:55:12,852 --> 00:55:14,270
You and your nagging.

652
00:55:14,353 --> 00:55:15,855
Watch it. I have customers.

653
00:55:20,985 --> 00:55:22,194
I miss Woo-hyeol.

654
00:55:23,112 --> 00:55:25,448
He would've been proud to see us

655
00:55:25,531 --> 00:55:26,657
make a decent living.

656
00:55:29,076 --> 00:55:30,578
I miss Woo-hyeol too.

657
00:55:30,828 --> 00:55:33,372
Imagine how hard
it must be for Butler Joo.

658
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:39,378
REFRESH REAL ESTATE CONSULTING
DONATION FOR CARDIAC SURGERY

659
00:55:39,462 --> 00:55:40,921
200 000 000 WON

660
00:55:50,056 --> 00:55:51,766
His donations so far

661
00:55:51,849 --> 00:55:55,352
have given new lives
to over 100 children with heart disease.

662
00:55:55,728 --> 00:55:58,064
Could you say a few words
to those children?

663
00:55:58,522 --> 00:55:59,523
Well...

664
00:56:00,441 --> 00:56:02,818
I'm glad I was able

665
00:56:02,902 --> 00:56:06,030
to be of help to young cardiac patients.

666
00:56:06,322 --> 00:56:07,948
I hope they will grow up

667
00:56:08,449 --> 00:56:10,367
to be healthy and kind adults

668
00:56:10,451 --> 00:56:12,787
who can have a good influence on society.

669
00:56:13,037 --> 00:56:15,831
"A good influence on society."
What a nice thing to say.

670
00:56:16,999 --> 00:56:18,209
Is there someone

671
00:56:18,292 --> 00:56:21,337
who has been a good influence on you?

672
00:56:26,175 --> 00:56:29,762
I once knew someone
who sacrificed everything they had

673
00:56:30,596 --> 00:56:32,348
for the person they loved.

674
00:56:35,101 --> 00:56:37,520
As I don't know when my life will end,

675
00:56:38,104 --> 00:56:41,816
I'm trying to love others
and be more generous every day.

676
00:56:43,776 --> 00:56:45,361
The second floor is even better.

677
00:56:45,444 --> 00:56:48,114
- It's so luxurious.
- Wow.

678
00:56:48,489 --> 00:56:49,657
Is that an oil painting?

679
00:56:50,616 --> 00:56:52,118
This must be our room.

680
00:56:53,327 --> 00:56:55,454
- You'll be in Room 203.
- Okay.

681
00:57:30,906 --> 00:57:32,616
SHADED OASIS GUEST HOUSE

682
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:35,161
Gosh, this is nice.

683
00:57:35,578 --> 00:57:37,121
It feels like a picnic every time.

684
00:57:37,204 --> 00:57:38,873
It's a party for the whole neighborhood.

685
00:57:38,956 --> 00:57:39,790
- Gi-suk.
- Yes?

686
00:57:39,874 --> 00:57:41,083
What did you bring today?

687
00:57:41,292 --> 00:57:43,335
Today? I made us kimchi jeon.

688
00:57:43,419 --> 00:57:44,837
Kimchi jeon?

689
00:57:49,341 --> 00:57:50,718
Please enjoy.

690
00:57:55,639 --> 00:57:57,057
- Please enjoy.
- Thank you.

691
00:57:57,141 --> 00:57:58,184
Hello.

692
00:57:59,351 --> 00:58:01,270
- Would you like one?
- Thanks.

693
00:58:01,687 --> 00:58:03,772
Min-jae will love it. We'll enjoy.

694
00:58:03,856 --> 00:58:06,108
- I'll leave these here. Help yourself.
- All right.

695
00:58:06,942 --> 00:58:08,652
Min-jae, let's eat.

696
00:58:09,987 --> 00:58:11,071
So-i!

697
00:58:11,405 --> 00:58:13,741
I'm not here to hide this time,
but to have fun.

698
00:58:15,868 --> 00:58:17,203
This place is packed.

699
00:58:17,661 --> 00:58:19,246
I've been working my butt off.

700
00:58:20,331 --> 00:58:22,875
You still have a vacant room
for me though, right?

701
00:58:22,958 --> 00:58:23,959
Of course.

702
00:58:24,293 --> 00:58:26,295
- Help yourself to some food first.
- Okay.

703
00:58:26,587 --> 00:58:27,588
- I'll catch you later.
- All right.

704
00:58:27,671 --> 00:58:29,673
Makgeolli should be enjoyed in these.

705
00:58:29,757 --> 00:58:30,925
You're right.

706
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:34,595
I'm glad I found drinking buddies
who live close by.

707
00:58:34,678 --> 00:58:36,013
- Hello.
- Hello.

708
00:58:36,096 --> 00:58:38,307
- Hello.
- I don't think we've met.

709
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:41,101
Right, I was the first-ever guest
at Shaded Oasis.

710
00:58:41,769 --> 00:58:43,354
- Shall we raise our glasses?
- Sure.

711
00:58:47,191 --> 00:58:50,069
A hot spot in the neighborhood
for those who love

712
00:58:50,152 --> 00:58:51,528
the night more than the day.

713
00:58:57,785 --> 00:58:58,786
Ms. Joo!

714
00:58:59,286 --> 00:59:01,497
- Goodness.
- Gosh, hello.

715
00:59:01,997 --> 00:59:03,999
- Hey.
- Come on in.

716
00:59:04,083 --> 00:59:06,126
- Hello, everyone.
- Hello.

717
00:59:07,127 --> 00:59:08,087
Min-jae, what's this?

718
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:11,090
Woo-hyeol, you're not with us anymore,
but Shaded Oasis is still blooming.

719
00:59:17,388 --> 00:59:18,514
Are we the only ones eating?

720
01:00:23,912 --> 01:00:25,831
Woo-hyeol, just like you once did,

721
01:00:26,749 --> 01:00:29,043
I'm also waiting for the one I love

722
01:00:30,002 --> 01:00:32,254
here at Shaded Oasis.

723
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:49,313
Come on. Let's drink.

724
01:00:49,396 --> 01:00:52,107
Goodness, I'll get drunk at this rate.

725
01:02:48,891 --> 01:02:50,893
THANK YOU FOR YOUR HEARTFELT SUPPORT
