HEARTBEAT

00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,298
ALL CHARACTERS, NAMES,
ORGANIZATIONS, GROUPS, EVENTS,

3
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,383
AND SETTINGS ARE FICTITIOUS
AND ANIMAL SAFETY GUIDELINES WERE FOLLOWED

4
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:07,693
Seon Woo-hyeol.

5
00:01:08,486 --> 00:01:10,112
Are you really going to die?

6
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,031
Really?

7
00:01:13,908 --> 00:01:14,825
Seriously?

8
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:21,457
I'll gladly die when my time comes,

9
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:23,125
but I'll never let you

10
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:25,419
have your way.

11
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,965
I hope we never meet again.

12
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:32,051
I hate

13
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:33,469
seeing you.

14
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:43,187
Who the hell is it?

EPISODE 14

16
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:15,970
Where's Woo-hyeol?

17
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:17,221
Where is he?!

18
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:30,109
- Seop!
- Dong-seop!

19
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:31,026
Seop!

20
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,404
Seop, are you all right?

21
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:38,701
How did you find this place?

22
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,454
I expected no less
from Woo-hyeol's minions.

23
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:46,750
No wonder the place reeked of blood.

24
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,379
Are you still sucking human blood?

25
00:02:51,547 --> 00:02:54,216
I see Woo-hyeol
didn't knock enough sense into you.

26
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,270
You'd better watch your mouth.

27
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:13,444
Lee Man-hwi!

28
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:22,578
Don't you lay a hand on her.

29
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:26,790
Are you okay?

30
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:32,671
Guys!

31
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,180
Hurry down there.
We'll take care of things here.

32
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:42,222
Got it.

33
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:44,516
- Be careful.
- Okay.

34
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,643
Woo-hyeol!

35
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:46,936
Are you sure about this?

36
00:03:49,647 --> 00:03:50,689
Woo-hyeol!

37
00:03:52,775 --> 00:03:54,443
Rose.

38
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,071
What the hell?

39
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:16,298
Come on out.

40
00:04:16,382 --> 00:04:17,466
Hurry.

41
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:21,303
Woo-hyeol, let's go.

42
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:24,807
- What is it?
- Hold on.

43
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:32,690
We'll buy you time, so get out of here.

44
00:04:36,527 --> 00:04:37,736
Thank you.

45
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:39,279
Wait.

46
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,492
Please be careful.

47
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:52,501
Sang-hae!

48
00:04:57,715 --> 00:04:58,757
Seop.

49
00:04:59,008 --> 00:05:00,968
Look how weak you've become

50
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,429
after drinking expired blood packs
all these years

51
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:04,972
instead of feeding on humans.

52
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:09,101
Vampires like you are the reason
the rest of us are treated like monsters!

53
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:11,895
What do you mean?

54
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:14,940
What are vampires

55
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:18,193
if not monsters?

56
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:28,203
We're...

57
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,755
nothing like you.

58
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:39,256
Woo-hyeol!

59
00:05:41,717 --> 00:05:42,718
Woo-hyeol...

60
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:59,568
You're the monster
who locks humans up and sucks their blood.

61
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:02,321
Not us.

62
00:06:03,072 --> 00:06:03,947
Sang-hae!

63
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:06,533
Lift it up.

64
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,285
Come on.

65
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:20,297
Woo-hyeol!

66
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:36,188
Woo-hyeol, where are you?

67
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,607
Please call me
as soon as you get this text.

68
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,167
Don't you dare

69
00:06:58,085 --> 00:06:59,294
lay a finger on Woo-hyeol.

70
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:27,489
Soon,

71
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:31,577
your gang will be a thing of the past.

72
00:07:34,872 --> 00:07:36,498
- Lee Man-hwi!
- Rose, don't.

73
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,042
How can we let him go?

74
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:40,252
Stay put.

75
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:41,628
Damn it.

76
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:43,922
- Woo-hyeol!
- Woo-hyeol.

77
00:07:44,173 --> 00:07:45,090
Woo-hyeol!

78
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:46,758
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

79
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:48,802
Woo-hyeol.

80
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:51,096
I'm okay.

81
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,015
My gosh.

82
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:55,809
You're far from okay.

83
00:07:55,893 --> 00:07:57,895
Your wounds aren't healing!

84
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:00,606
- What's wrong with you?
- Rose...

85
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:02,858
- What's going on with you?!
- Come on.

86
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:04,484
Woo-hyeol, for now...

87
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:05,611
Mr. Seon.

88
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,079
I don't know if you recognize me,

89
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,999
but I'm Joo Dong-il.

90
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:27,090
You're...

91
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:30,302
I don't know how to thank you.

92
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,846
Thank you so much.

93
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:34,598
Not at all.

94
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:36,391
I should be thanking you.

95
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:38,227
I'm so relieved

96
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:40,020
that you're still alive.

97
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:43,565
Your daughter will also be delighted.

98
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:46,944
My daughter?

99
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:50,864
Come with me.

100
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:13,804
What?

101
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:15,931
Where is everyone?

102
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:31,506
How could you come here alone
in your state

103
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,091
without telling us?

104
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:35,761
What if something had happened to you?

105
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:40,932
Man-hwi lured me to this place.

106
00:10:41,183 --> 00:10:44,353
We were lucky Rose felt something strange
from this place on her delivery route.

107
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:46,229
Things could've been bad.

108
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:47,397
Tell me about it.

109
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:50,817
The place reeked of blood,
and I had a bad feeling about it.

110
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:55,572
I'm sorry.

111
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,490
Woo-hyeol.

112
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:00,494
Can you stop apologizing to us?

113
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:03,497
You always take action on your own
and only apologize afterward.

114
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:07,000
- Sang-hae.
- Hey, he's hurt. Don't be so harsh.

115
00:11:07,793 --> 00:11:09,836
I'm just upset.

116
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:24,434
SHADED OASIS GUEST HOUSE

117
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:26,645
I had no idea

118
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:29,523
I'd be back here.

119
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:35,779
Please don't tell In-hae
about what happened

120
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:38,407
at that place.

121
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:41,535
She might be shocked.

122
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:45,497
She must've had a rough time
being all alone,

123
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:48,166
and I don't want to worry her.

124
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,753
All right.

125
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:56,800
Shall we?

126
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:03,932
Woo-hyeol, where were you?

127
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:05,851
Well...

128
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:15,610
In-hae.

129
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:29,124
You must have a lot to talk about,

130
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:30,667
so I'll give you some space.

131
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:58,945
Thank you, In-hae,

132
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:02,449
for growing up to be

133
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:04,534
such a healthy young woman.

134
00:13:08,163 --> 00:13:09,164
I should've

135
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:12,417
come back sooner.

136
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:17,130
I'm sorry I took so long.

137
00:13:21,343 --> 00:13:23,720
I thought you were dead and long gone.

138
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,263
But you came back in one piece.

139
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,354
Why are you here?

140
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:35,607
You should've just stayed dead.

141
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:39,444
Why did you appear out of the blue?

142
00:13:40,904 --> 00:13:42,531
I wanted to reach out,

143
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:45,825
but I couldn't.

144
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:48,119
I'm not interested in your excuses,
so leave.

145
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:50,205
In-hae.

146
00:13:51,957 --> 00:13:53,625
You shouldn't have shown up.

147
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:57,587
You should've lived a good life
after abandoning your family.

148
00:13:58,213 --> 00:14:00,340
How am I supposed to react
after all this time?

149
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:03,134
Did you think I'd thank you
for staying alive?

150
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:05,345
I didn't abandon you and your mom.

151
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:06,721
It wasn't like that.

152
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:09,266
- I--
- I don't need a dad like you!

153
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,726
So leave if you're done talking.

154
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:12,978
And don't ever come back here.

155
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:36,418
Why do something I didn't ask you to do?

156
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:39,212
I never asked you to find my dad.

157
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:41,590
He's not just your father.

158
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:46,261
He's also the man I must thank
for protecting this mansion for so long.

159
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:49,264
You might want to thank him, but I don't.

160
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:53,351
He's a selfish jerk
who abandoned his family.

161
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:56,229
He's your only family.

162
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:00,650
He was concerned about you.

163
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:03,403
That you must've had it rough.

164
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:09,075
Blood is thicker than water.

165
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,455
Your father must've missed you dearly.

166
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:18,627
How about

167
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:21,212
you forgive him now?

168
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:24,924
It's too late.

169
00:15:27,344 --> 00:15:28,762
I'll never forgive him.

170
00:15:40,065 --> 00:15:41,066
Hey, In...

171
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:04,547
Woo-hyeol might die?

172
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:10,553
He eventually will unless
he sucks Butler Joo dry of her blood.

173
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:14,015
You're lying.

174
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:16,768
Why would he die?

175
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,395
It's not true, is it?

176
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:19,938
You're messing with me, right?

177
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:26,111
Wait.

178
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,155
You're not joking?

179
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:33,243
Then...

180
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,162
was finding Butler Joo's father

181
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,624
his way of settling his affairs?

182
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:41,543
So that she won't be lonely after he dies?

183
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:43,253
Enough about him dying!

184
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:44,629
I won't let it happen.

185
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:47,006
And how exactly are you going to do that?

186
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:48,591
What can we possibly do about it?

187
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:53,471
Poor Woo-hyeol.

188
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,351
You guys better stay strong.

189
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:04,441
What are you going to do now?

190
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:06,609
This happened because you taught him
how to become human.

191
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:09,195
What will you do
if something happens to him?

192
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:19,289
Woo-hyeol...

193
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:23,376
is doing everything he can.

194
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:27,255
And I've decided to respect

195
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:30,049
his choice.

196
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:38,016
It may be difficult,

197
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:42,645
but do your best
to protect him until the very end.

198
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:15,470
You can stay here.

199
00:18:16,221 --> 00:18:17,388
The bathroom is downstairs.

200
00:18:19,808 --> 00:18:21,810
Let me know if you need anything.

201
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,603
I don't know...

202
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:27,732
if I should stay here.

203
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:29,859
It may take some time,

204
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:31,611
but all will be well.

205
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:33,988
She missed her father dearly.

206
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:38,618
By the way,

207
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:42,121
didn't you go into a slumber for 100 years
to become human?

208
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:44,332
From what I gathered,

209
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:46,459
you seemed to have failed to become one.

210
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:48,169
Did something happen?

211
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:51,881
It turned out that way.

212
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:55,927
That's too bad.

213
00:18:57,846 --> 00:18:59,347
Although I failed to become human,

214
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,391
I don't regret it at all.

215
00:19:02,225 --> 00:19:04,853
I gained something
more precious than that.

216
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:07,981
And I owe it all to your family.

217
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:11,276
It was only possible
because you protected me

218
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:12,360
and this mansion.

219
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:16,906
It truly is amazing
to finally meet the person

220
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,450
who has been talked about in my family
for generations.

221
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:23,121
I have always been curious about you,

222
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:26,833
and you brought me to my daughter.

223
00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:29,586
Thank you so much.

224
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:39,888
I apologize for what you had to
go through there.

225
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:42,140
Not all vampires are like that,

226
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:45,310
so please don't get the wrong idea.

227
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:49,230
Get a good night's rest then.

228
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:32,982
In-hae.

229
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:35,985
What on earth has he been through?

230
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:56,005
LEE MAN-HWI

231
00:20:59,968 --> 00:21:01,469
What are you playing at?

232
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:04,514
His minions showed up,
so I had to let him go.

233
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:05,431
What?

234
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:07,517
I even had my hideout compromised

235
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,519
while trying to capture him.

236
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:11,270
Those little bastards.

237
00:21:11,521 --> 00:21:13,523
Your hideout? What was going on there?

238
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,441
What have you been doing--

239
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:16,609
That's none of your concern.

240
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:18,569
You'd better refrain
from reckless behavior.

241
00:21:18,653 --> 00:21:20,947
- What?
- Act rationally.

242
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:23,032
Seon Woo-hyeol's blood comes first.

243
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:24,951
If you want the job done,

244
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:26,577
choose your actions wisely.

245
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:28,746
Okay. Just you wait.

246
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:31,582
I will capture Seon Woo-hyeol
with my own hands no matter what.

247
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:18,838
How are you feeling?

248
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:23,301
Good, thanks to you.

249
00:22:24,177 --> 00:22:25,178
I'm glad.

250
00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:28,139
But you see,

251
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:30,683
it seems like I hurt In-hae deeply,

252
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:33,603
and I don't know what to do about it.

253
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,772
Clear up any misunderstandings

254
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:39,984
and ask her for forgiveness
for the things you've done wrong.

255
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:44,030
She may have been staying at this mansion

256
00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:48,618
in hopes of you coming back here one day.

257
00:22:50,203 --> 00:22:52,246
Do you really think so?

258
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:59,796
It was around the time redevelopment
of this neighborhood was being discussed.

259
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:03,716
Lee Man-hwi approached me

260
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,594
and suggested
I sell the mansion for a price.

261
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:10,181
I held my ground
refusing to sell the property

262
00:23:10,264 --> 00:23:13,810
to keep the promise
that was made by my bloodline.

263
00:23:17,188 --> 00:23:18,523
REDEVELOPMENT BRIEFING FOR RESIDENTS

264
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:19,649
Darn it.

265
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:22,777
What's so special
about that beat-up house anyway?

266
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:24,487
Tell me about it.

267
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,656
What a selfish man. How frustrating.

268
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:28,866
- The redevelopment...
- When redevelopment

269
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:31,077
was about to fall through because of me,

270
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:34,247
the neighbors started resenting me.

271
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:38,543
I had a lot of debt,

272
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:41,963
so I'd be lying if I said
I wasn't swayed by the offer.

273
00:23:43,256 --> 00:23:46,008
However, I wanted to protect this mansion.

274
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:52,723
I believed that protecting this house
as its last butler

275
00:23:53,391 --> 00:23:55,726
was the way to protect my family

276
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:57,854
and my one and only daughter.

277
00:23:59,856 --> 00:24:01,691
I had made up my mind,

278
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:03,985
but then he paid me another visit.

279
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:07,989
As I told you numerous times,

280
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:09,407
the mansion isn't for sale.

281
00:24:09,991 --> 00:24:11,284
So please go back.

282
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:18,624
And that night,

283
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:21,127
something unexpected happened.

284
00:24:23,421 --> 00:24:25,590
How did you get in here?

285
00:24:25,673 --> 00:24:27,925
I can do anything if I put my mind to it.

286
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:29,844
Get out.

287
00:24:30,428 --> 00:24:31,387
Leave this instant.

288
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:39,228
What the hell are you?

289
00:24:49,906 --> 00:24:52,575
I told you to go easy on the alcohol.

290
00:25:10,218 --> 00:25:12,637
What on earth are you doing?

291
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:14,055
Where am I?

292
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,643
See?

293
00:25:19,477 --> 00:25:21,896
This wouldn't have happened
had you obeyed.

294
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:26,067
What's so special
about that beat-up mansion anyway?

295
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:29,111
Protecting it

296
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:32,156
won't bring back Seon Woo-hyeol.

297
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:36,285
I gave you a chance.

298
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:39,247
And you're the one who blew it.

299
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:49,423
Open this! Hey!

300
00:25:49,924 --> 00:25:51,676
Get me out of here!

301
00:25:51,926 --> 00:25:54,053
Hey! Open this!

302
00:25:54,136 --> 00:25:55,471
Open it!

303
00:25:56,264 --> 00:25:57,348
There was nothing

304
00:25:58,057 --> 00:26:01,602
I could possibly do in there.

305
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,521
All I could do

306
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:07,984
was hang on for dear life
while letting him feed on me.

307
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:12,905
With death drawing near,

308
00:26:16,951 --> 00:26:18,160
only my family

309
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:20,830
came to mind.

310
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:28,879
I couldn't die leaving In-hae all alone,

311
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:34,385
because I promised her I'd come back.

312
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:38,639
I was a lousy dad

313
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:41,350
who had done nothing

314
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:43,561
for his daughter.

315
00:26:45,229 --> 00:26:46,272
That's why...

316
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,860
I at least wanted to keep my word

317
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,238
and come back to her at all costs.

318
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:23,017
It won't be easy for her to gather
that much money in a short time.

319
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:24,518
Then let the law handle it.

320
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:27,521
Isn't that your job?

321
00:27:29,065 --> 00:27:31,901
The one who lacks money
will give in first.

322
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:33,069
Yes, ma'am.

323
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:36,947
By the way, while we're at it,

324
00:27:37,198 --> 00:27:39,658
let's resume the redevelopment
in Gongcheon-dong.

325
00:27:39,742 --> 00:27:40,826
In Gongcheon-dong?

326
00:27:41,744 --> 00:27:43,996
We'll strongly push for it this time.

327
00:27:44,372 --> 00:27:46,916
Put together a redevelopment association.

328
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:48,542
Consider it done.

329
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:53,089
All right.

330
00:27:53,506 --> 00:27:54,548
I'll see you later.

331
00:28:03,724 --> 00:28:05,267
I even had my hideout compromised

332
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:06,727
while trying to capture him.

333
00:28:07,228 --> 00:28:09,271
What's yours is mine.

334
00:28:09,772 --> 00:28:11,023
We're in the same boat.

335
00:28:12,983 --> 00:28:14,151
Just you wait.

336
00:28:14,485 --> 00:28:16,987
I will capture Seon Woo-hyeol
with my own hands no matter what.

337
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,448
Will it be all right?

338
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:23,702
Mr. Shin.

339
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:25,913
You should see this.

340
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:27,832
What is it?

341
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:31,377
Ms. Na is withdrawing her investment
in the guest house.

342
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:33,504
What?

343
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,134
LETTER OF WITHDRAWAL OF INVESTMENT

344
00:29:14,795 --> 00:29:16,547
You look like a different person.

345
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:32,229
Oh, there you are.

346
00:29:35,566 --> 00:29:36,609
What do you think?

347
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:38,861
He got a haircut and is dressed up.

348
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:40,738
Doesn't he look great?

349
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:49,371
Don't leave your post
during business hours.

350
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:16,607
I couldn't die leaving In-hae all alone,

351
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:21,654
because I promised her I'd come back.

352
00:30:26,075 --> 00:30:29,078
In-hae, may I come in?

353
00:30:31,914 --> 00:30:33,207
I'm coming in.

354
00:30:45,219 --> 00:30:46,178
In-hae.

355
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:52,476
You must...

356
00:30:55,104 --> 00:30:56,355
hate me a lot.

357
00:31:00,568 --> 00:31:01,569
All this time,

358
00:31:02,945 --> 00:31:04,905
you've had it rough all on your own.

359
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:09,743
I'm sorry.

360
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:13,330
I truly am.

361
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:19,420
I didn't

362
00:31:20,337 --> 00:31:22,590
abandon you or your mom.

363
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,260
I wanted to return to you,

364
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:28,387
but I couldn't.

365
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:31,515
But still,

366
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:35,978
I prayed over and over again

367
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:39,773
for one last chance to see you.

368
00:31:42,318 --> 00:31:43,861
And I'm relieved

369
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:46,864
that we got to see each other again.

370
00:31:48,365 --> 00:31:49,491
Now I can die

371
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:51,952
without any regrets.

372
00:32:01,211 --> 00:32:02,838
Who says you can die?

373
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:10,804
I resented and loathed you.

374
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:16,101
Do you know how scary it was
to be left all alone?

375
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:23,525
Do you know how much I missed you?

376
00:32:31,659 --> 00:32:33,035
I'm sorry.

377
00:32:34,328 --> 00:32:35,454
I'm sorry.

378
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,836
Thank you for holding out.

379
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,715
Thank you

380
00:32:47,341 --> 00:32:49,426
for keeping your promise
and coming back to me.

381
00:32:52,846 --> 00:32:54,056
I'm sorry, Dad.

382
00:33:10,114 --> 00:33:11,657
I'm sorry, Dad.

383
00:33:13,033 --> 00:33:15,327
I'm so sorry for being harsh.

384
00:33:25,796 --> 00:33:27,464
I was flustered by the news.

385
00:33:27,548 --> 00:33:29,216
That's what I should be saying.

386
00:33:29,842 --> 00:33:31,260
Vampires at a guest house?

387
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:32,678
How does that make sense?

388
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:34,388
It doesn't, and I know that.

389
00:33:34,888 --> 00:33:36,932
But you should be trying
to eliminate the problem,

390
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,392
not withdrawing your investment.

391
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:41,895
If you do this when the guest house
only recently opened,

392
00:33:41,979 --> 00:33:43,021
the investee will--

393
00:33:43,105 --> 00:33:45,566
What's the issue
with withdrawing my own money?

394
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,485
It's already been reviewed by my lawyer,

395
00:33:48,569 --> 00:33:49,737
and everything's by the book.

396
00:33:50,404 --> 00:33:52,364
Ms. Joo also agreed to comply.

397
00:33:52,865 --> 00:33:54,450
What? She did?

398
00:33:55,826 --> 00:33:56,994
It's already decided.

399
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:59,997
No, this should've been discussed
with me, not In-hae.

400
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:01,999
The guest house was my idea,

401
00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:04,334
which means I'm responsible
for the investment money.

402
00:34:04,835 --> 00:34:05,919
Mr. Shin,

403
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:08,380
have you always been this unprofessional?

404
00:34:08,464 --> 00:34:10,424
I'd like to ask you the same thing.

405
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:13,552
You're acting on your emotions.

406
00:34:16,764 --> 00:34:18,140
I'm disappointed.

407
00:34:19,266 --> 00:34:22,478
If this is how it'll be,
I'll have to reconsider

408
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:24,062
all my other investments.

409
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:42,790
Mom worried about you
even in her last moments.

410
00:34:45,167 --> 00:34:47,503
I was scared at the time

411
00:34:48,045 --> 00:34:51,340
because I didn't know
what to do when a person died.

412
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:53,801
I also felt bad for Mom.

413
00:34:56,804 --> 00:35:01,725
I should've done everything I could
to stay with you and your mom.

414
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:11,735
Here.

415
00:35:16,824 --> 00:35:19,868
Have you been holding on to this?

416
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:23,872
I found it while cleaning the place.

417
00:35:24,373 --> 00:35:25,624
You remember it, right?

418
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,418
Whenever you went out,

419
00:35:28,502 --> 00:35:30,629
you had me keep it safe for you.

420
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,590
Of course I remember it.

421
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:38,345
It holds

422
00:35:39,346 --> 00:35:40,722
my most precious treasure inside.

423
00:36:03,871 --> 00:36:06,456
Did you put these up?

424
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:08,417
Yes.

425
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,503
I wanted to show you

426
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:16,258
that flowers can bloom

427
00:36:16,592 --> 00:36:17,926
even on a dead tree.

428
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,470
And likewise,

429
00:36:20,554 --> 00:36:24,474
you can love and be loved by someone.

430
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,562
Even in my absence,

431
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:31,315
I hope you never forget.

432
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:34,151
That you are someone

433
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:37,029
who can love and be loved.

434
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:45,871
Thank you

435
00:36:46,496 --> 00:36:47,831
for rescuing my dad.

436
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,252
No, don't.

437
00:36:53,337 --> 00:36:55,130
I cried too much.

438
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:58,258
I'd rather talk like this.

439
00:37:08,268 --> 00:37:09,311
You did well.

440
00:37:10,479 --> 00:37:11,605
I know it wasn't easy for you.

441
00:37:14,191 --> 00:37:15,275
Good job.

442
00:37:19,112 --> 00:37:20,155
Thank you.

443
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:25,577
I always seem to be
thanking you for things.

444
00:37:29,122 --> 00:37:31,166
Why are you so good to me?

445
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:35,921
I ruined everything for you
by opening the coffin a day early.

446
00:37:40,968 --> 00:37:42,219
What can I do about it?

447
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:46,056
I'll let it slide
since I'm handsome and kind.

448
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:47,349
My goodness.

449
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:07,369
Since this is how it is,

450
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:09,287
why don't we move things up?

451
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,085
Happy Blood Day.

452
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:19,131
You'll drink blood filled with love
and become human.

453
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:21,550
Right.

454
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:24,553
What is it?

455
00:38:27,431 --> 00:38:30,017
I don't think that's the best idea.

456
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:34,396
Why not? Don't you want
to become human as soon as possible?

457
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,528
I want to protect you
for as long as possible.

458
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:45,949
But you can do that
even after becoming human.

459
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:47,993
Well...

460
00:38:50,912 --> 00:38:53,790
The scar that alerts me
when you're in danger

461
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:57,919
will be gone once I become human.

462
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:01,631
I want to protect you for as long as I can

463
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:05,427
before it disappears.

464
00:39:16,605 --> 00:39:17,939
No way!

465
00:39:18,607 --> 00:39:20,650
Gi-suk!

466
00:39:20,734 --> 00:39:21,943
Did you hear the news?

467
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:23,361
What news?

468
00:39:23,445 --> 00:39:24,654
What do I do with you?

469
00:39:24,738 --> 00:39:25,697
Check this out.

470
00:39:25,781 --> 00:39:27,699
They're getting our signatures

471
00:39:27,783 --> 00:39:29,785
to start up
the redevelopment project again.

472
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:30,911
Really?

473
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:32,496
That's right. Look.

474
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:35,332
Our patience is finally going to pay off.

475
00:39:35,415 --> 00:39:36,500
REDEVELOPMENT CONSENT FORM

476
00:39:36,917 --> 00:39:38,043
You weren't kidding.

477
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:40,962
Of course I wasn't. Check it out!

478
00:39:42,172 --> 00:39:43,673
- Finally!
- Finally!

479
00:39:43,757 --> 00:39:46,468
- This is great!
- I know!

480
00:39:48,678 --> 00:39:49,805
Goodness.

481
00:39:54,351 --> 00:39:56,728
Don't worry about me and help yourself.

482
00:39:56,812 --> 00:39:58,647
I doubt you had proper meals there.

483
00:39:59,356 --> 00:40:01,858
Tell me if there's anything you want.
I'll buy it for you.

484
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:07,989
Did everyone else go somewhere
without having dinner?

485
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,991
Right.

486
00:40:10,075 --> 00:40:12,744
They're eating out
to give us some time to ourselves.

487
00:40:13,954 --> 00:40:14,996
Eating out?

488
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:19,751
It's a thing.

489
00:40:20,293 --> 00:40:21,461
Let's eat while it's still warm.

490
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:24,965
Let me try.

491
00:40:29,094 --> 00:40:31,388
- It tastes so rich.
- It has black hoof mushrooms in it.

492
00:40:31,471 --> 00:40:32,389
Have some.

493
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:39,938
You were scammed out of your deposit?

494
00:40:40,647 --> 00:40:41,648
Yes.

495
00:40:41,982 --> 00:40:43,942
I had nowhere to go,

496
00:40:44,234 --> 00:40:46,695
so I ended up living here.

497
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:48,321
In hindsight, it was for the best.

498
00:40:48,864 --> 00:40:51,241
Thanks to Woo-hyeol,
I got to see you again.

499
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:55,120
But...

500
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:59,207
wasn't it uncomfortable
to live with him under the same roof?

501
00:41:02,711 --> 00:41:04,546
It was nice

502
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:07,299
to have him here.

503
00:41:08,675 --> 00:41:09,676
I see.

504
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:22,939
In-hae.

505
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,067
Do you perhaps...

506
00:41:31,281 --> 00:41:32,365
Never mind.

507
00:41:33,533 --> 00:41:34,784
That's a relief.

508
00:41:35,202 --> 00:41:37,829
It would've been scary
to live in an old house by yourself.

509
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:39,539
You're right.

510
00:41:39,915 --> 00:41:42,417
I wouldn't have managed without him.

511
00:42:04,147 --> 00:42:06,191
Have you thought of a way
to capture Seon Woo-hyeol?

512
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:07,651
There is a way.

513
00:42:08,985 --> 00:42:10,070
Which is?

514
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:12,489
Why should I tell you?

515
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:19,829
I'll double the payment.

516
00:42:21,581 --> 00:42:22,999
But money isn't everything.

517
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:25,627
My life will also be on the line.

518
00:42:26,503 --> 00:42:29,047
Are you worried
that I might kill you or something?

519
00:42:31,383 --> 00:42:33,593
It's just that I don't trust humans.

520
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:38,431
All right.

521
00:42:38,515 --> 00:42:39,683
This is where it ends.

522
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,559
The deal is off.

523
00:42:41,643 --> 00:42:42,644
You can go.

524
00:42:43,144 --> 00:42:46,189
As a human, you're inferior
to vampires in every aspect.

525
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:49,442
Do you really think
you can capture him yourself?

526
00:42:53,196 --> 00:42:55,115
A half-vampire isn't like us,

527
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:58,159
and it'll take a special way
to capture one.

528
00:43:00,036 --> 00:43:03,331
If you tell me how I can
get the blood of a half-vampire,

529
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,792
I'll provide all that is needed.

530
00:43:11,131 --> 00:43:12,549
Fine, here's how it'll be.

531
00:43:15,427 --> 00:43:19,931
Tell me why you need
a half-vampire's blood,

532
00:43:20,473 --> 00:43:21,641
and I'll tell you what I know.

533
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:28,440
Is Ms. Joo In-hae here?

534
00:43:28,732 --> 00:43:30,191
She's our boss. Why do you ask?

535
00:43:30,275 --> 00:43:32,485
A registered mail was sent from the court.

536
00:43:32,569 --> 00:43:33,486
- The court?
- Yes.

537
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:34,738
What's going on?

538
00:43:34,821 --> 00:43:36,990
A registered mail was sent to you
from the court.

539
00:43:41,077 --> 00:43:42,454
Please sign right here.

540
00:43:42,537 --> 00:43:43,997
Okay. Here you go.

541
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:46,333
Thank you. Have a good day.

542
00:43:46,416 --> 00:43:47,709
You too.

543
00:43:52,047 --> 00:43:53,423
Did you get into trouble?

544
00:43:53,506 --> 00:43:54,466
What? Trouble?

545
00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:56,593
No, it's nothing like that.

546
00:43:56,843 --> 00:43:58,511
- Absolutely not.
- This is weird.

547
00:43:58,595 --> 00:44:00,680
Then why are you getting mail
from the court?

548
00:44:15,278 --> 00:44:16,696
ORDER OF PAYMENT

549
00:44:21,618 --> 00:44:26,247
It's an order of payment
issued by the court.

550
00:44:29,459 --> 00:44:32,670
I might have to relinquish
this house to Ms. Na.

551
00:44:33,922 --> 00:44:36,216
What do you mean
you'll have to relinquish it?

552
00:44:41,221 --> 00:44:42,222
The thing is,

553
00:44:43,223 --> 00:44:47,143
Ms. Na came by recently
and asked to return the investment money.

554
00:44:49,145 --> 00:44:51,815
Why is she suddenly
withdrawing her investment?

555
00:44:54,859 --> 00:44:57,028
Because she found out you're a vampire.

556
00:45:01,533 --> 00:45:03,535
She can't allow any at the guest house.

557
00:45:24,973 --> 00:45:26,141
SEON WOO-HYEOL

558
00:45:37,444 --> 00:45:38,903
It isn't like you to call me first.

559
00:45:39,362 --> 00:45:40,238
What is this about?

560
00:45:41,156 --> 00:45:42,449
Are you free today?

561
00:45:43,116 --> 00:45:44,367
I'd like to have a word.

562
00:45:44,951 --> 00:45:45,869
Sounds good.

563
00:45:46,703 --> 00:45:47,829
Can we meet at my place?

564
00:45:48,705 --> 00:45:50,331
Sure, I'll be there.

565
00:45:56,129 --> 00:45:58,798
Money sure talks.

566
00:46:03,511 --> 00:46:06,514
INVESTMENT CONTRACT

567
00:46:23,323 --> 00:46:25,241
If you're doing this because of me, stop.

568
00:46:26,284 --> 00:46:27,702
All I have to do is leave.

569
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:28,912
I'll leave, so the mansion--

570
00:46:28,995 --> 00:46:32,248
No, it should be her who should leave.

571
00:46:33,041 --> 00:46:35,084
She's the one who got in between us.

572
00:46:35,835 --> 00:46:38,129
She must leave
for us to have a happy ending.

573
00:46:38,213 --> 00:46:39,255
Ms. Na.

574
00:46:41,174 --> 00:46:42,509
Do you still not get it?

575
00:46:42,884 --> 00:46:45,887
What I want is the mansion and you.

576
00:46:46,262 --> 00:46:49,098
All will be solved once Joo In-hae leaves.

577
00:46:49,849 --> 00:46:50,850
Do you get it?

578
00:46:53,895 --> 00:46:57,440
I ask that you leave the mansion alone.

579
00:46:58,733 --> 00:46:59,651
What?

580
00:46:59,734 --> 00:47:02,362
To you, it may be just another mansion
you'd like to possess,

581
00:47:02,862 --> 00:47:06,074
but some people have risked their lives
to keep their promise to protect it.

582
00:47:07,992 --> 00:47:10,828
Butler Joo found her father
and is finally about to be happy.

583
00:47:11,496 --> 00:47:14,332
Putting her through such difficulty again
is too cruel.

584
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:18,670
Please let go of your greed
for that mansion.

585
00:47:18,753 --> 00:47:20,380
I don't know what story that house holds,

586
00:47:20,463 --> 00:47:22,465
but I doubt I should be concerned.

587
00:47:36,896 --> 00:47:38,773
Do you have a moment?

588
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:40,567
I'd like to ask you something.

589
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:44,112
What is it about?

590
00:47:54,122 --> 00:47:58,626
Since you managed this house for so long,
you should know better than anyone.

591
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:01,796
Did you visit the basement at times?

592
00:48:02,714 --> 00:48:04,382
Yes, I went down there occasionally

593
00:48:04,465 --> 00:48:06,342
to brush the dust off the coffin

594
00:48:06,426 --> 00:48:08,970
and make sure there was no mold.

595
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:10,638
Is there something wrong?

596
00:48:10,722 --> 00:48:12,390
No, nothing's wrong.

597
00:48:12,473 --> 00:48:15,351
So you made frequent visits
to the basement.

598
00:48:16,561 --> 00:48:17,562
Then...

599
00:48:18,563 --> 00:48:22,066
do you know anything about the gold
that was in the basement?

600
00:48:22,734 --> 00:48:23,776
Sorry?

601
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:25,361
Gold?

602
00:48:27,947 --> 00:48:30,283
There was gold in the basement?

603
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,246
I need you to answer me honestly.
Are you saying this is news to you?

604
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:37,874
I never heard anything about it.

605
00:48:38,166 --> 00:48:39,334
I see.

606
00:48:40,293 --> 00:48:41,919
Then this conversation never happened.

607
00:48:52,096 --> 00:48:54,891
Who in the world took the gold?

608
00:48:56,100 --> 00:49:02,398
LAW OFFICE SEONJIN

609
00:49:02,482 --> 00:49:05,568
According to the contract,
there seem to be no legal issues.

610
00:49:05,818 --> 00:49:07,612
If you can't pay back
the investment money,

611
00:49:07,695 --> 00:49:10,573
I suggest you meet
with the investor to settle.

612
00:49:21,209 --> 00:49:22,210
Hello?

613
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:25,421
What?

614
00:49:50,154 --> 00:49:51,280
Have you been well?

615
00:49:55,868 --> 00:49:56,869
Do-sik,

616
00:49:57,578 --> 00:50:00,707
what happened with the investment money?

617
00:50:01,541 --> 00:50:02,542
You didn't even tell me.

618
00:50:04,043 --> 00:50:06,504
I know you would've been
struggling with it alone.

619
00:50:08,214 --> 00:50:10,466
It was my idea to open the guest house.

620
00:50:11,592 --> 00:50:13,761
I only helped you
because I felt somewhat responsible.

621
00:50:18,725 --> 00:50:22,103
I'm not happy about you living
with Seon Woo-hyeol in that mansion,

622
00:50:23,104 --> 00:50:25,022
but I couldn't sit by and watch you

623
00:50:26,232 --> 00:50:27,525
get kicked out.

624
00:50:33,406 --> 00:50:35,158
I don't know what I feel anymore.

625
00:50:37,869 --> 00:50:38,911
I'm a businessman,

626
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:43,124
but I can never think straight
when you're involved.

627
00:50:46,294 --> 00:50:47,795
This is me burdening you.

628
00:50:50,298 --> 00:50:52,008
I still feel the same way.

629
00:51:08,107 --> 00:51:09,275
What do you think you're doing?

630
00:51:10,485 --> 00:51:11,486
What do you mean?

631
00:51:11,569 --> 00:51:13,362
You paid back
the investment money yourself.

632
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:16,365
As I said last time,

633
00:51:16,449 --> 00:51:18,409
I suggested opening the guest house

634
00:51:18,493 --> 00:51:20,453
so I'm also responsible
for the investment money.

635
00:51:20,536 --> 00:51:22,997
So? You're going to help the vampire out?

636
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,708
No one should get their lives
turned upside down

637
00:51:25,958 --> 00:51:27,919
just because someone
gives and takes as pleases.

638
00:51:29,587 --> 00:51:30,588
What?

639
00:51:31,923 --> 00:51:34,759
I'm all for acquiring
what you want with money.

640
00:51:35,718 --> 00:51:39,680
But it's wrong
to cause trouble for others using money.

641
00:51:43,184 --> 00:51:45,061
If you did this to help Joo In-hae,

642
00:51:45,144 --> 00:51:46,813
you made the wrong choice.

643
00:51:47,522 --> 00:51:48,981
You should tear her and Woo-hyeol apart.

644
00:51:49,065 --> 00:51:51,984
Until when are you going to
act as her benefactor?

645
00:51:52,652 --> 00:51:53,778
You should leave.

646
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:56,823
There's no way I'm backing off.

647
00:51:57,365 --> 00:51:59,283
You should also brace yourself
for what's coming.

648
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:24,725
Do you still not get it?

649
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:28,437
What I want is the mansion and you.

650
00:52:28,521 --> 00:52:31,274
All will be solved once Joo In-hae leaves.

651
00:52:47,498 --> 00:52:48,541
Woo-hyeol.

652
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:52,461
Woo-hyeol, are you all right?

653
00:52:52,795 --> 00:52:53,921
Let me help you up.

654
00:53:01,804 --> 00:53:02,972
What happened to your arm?

655
00:53:04,599 --> 00:53:06,809
Why has this been going on?

656
00:53:06,893 --> 00:53:08,436
There's something wrong with you, right?

657
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:12,356
Don't worry about me.

658
00:53:14,358 --> 00:53:15,401
I'm fine.

659
00:53:16,235 --> 00:53:18,988
Woo-hyeol!

660
00:53:20,281 --> 00:53:21,240
Oh, no.

661
00:53:32,501 --> 00:53:34,295
Why does this keep happening?

662
00:53:42,428 --> 00:53:43,763
I'm the reason, aren't I?

663
00:53:45,306 --> 00:53:48,476
He needs my blood to get better, right?

664
00:53:52,313 --> 00:53:54,523
We don't know the details.

665
00:53:54,607 --> 00:53:57,652
You should ask Woo-hyeol when he comes to.

666
00:54:30,726 --> 00:54:32,353
He's not okay.

667
00:54:33,521 --> 00:54:35,189
He collapsed seconds after saying that.

668
00:54:38,985 --> 00:54:40,611
We can't postpone it any longer.

669
00:54:42,196 --> 00:54:43,698
Once he wakes up,

670
00:54:44,407 --> 00:54:46,200
I'll have him drink my blood
and become human.

671
00:54:52,623 --> 00:54:54,250
They'll go through
with it this time, right?

672
00:54:54,667 --> 00:54:55,626
Of course.

673
00:54:55,710 --> 00:54:57,545
Rumors have been spreading

674
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,464
that the whole neighborhood
will be redeveloped,

675
00:55:00,548 --> 00:55:02,341
and mixed-use buildings will be built.

676
00:55:04,218 --> 00:55:05,553
If that happens,

677
00:55:05,636 --> 00:55:07,847
I'll close down my shop and travel around.

678
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:11,809
Maybe I should open a fried chicken place
with the compensation I get.

679
00:55:11,892 --> 00:55:13,811
A fried chicken place?
That's out of the blue.

680
00:55:13,894 --> 00:55:15,521
You should open a jeweler's

681
00:55:15,604 --> 00:55:17,565
since your name has "jade" in it.

682
00:55:17,648 --> 00:55:18,941
You're right.

683
00:55:19,567 --> 00:55:20,735
It'll be a success.

684
00:55:23,738 --> 00:55:24,822
Are you here to buy meat?

685
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:27,742
No.

686
00:55:29,035 --> 00:55:30,619
I'm here to purchase the neighborhood.

687
00:55:30,995 --> 00:55:31,912
Sorry?

688
00:55:46,469 --> 00:55:47,470
Mr. Shin.

689
00:55:49,972 --> 00:55:51,182
I have it ready for you.

690
00:55:53,726 --> 00:55:54,727
Good work.

691
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:59,440
It's a knife made of hawthorn wood
and silver as you requested.

692
00:56:59,375 --> 00:57:00,459
Woo-hyeol.

693
00:57:00,543 --> 00:57:01,502
Let me help you up.

694
00:57:01,585 --> 00:57:03,337
What happened to your arm?
There's something wrong with you, right?

695
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:04,463
I'm fine.

696
00:57:05,172 --> 00:57:06,048
Woo-hyeol.

697
00:57:06,132 --> 00:57:07,800
Since this is how it is,

698
00:57:08,175 --> 00:57:09,927
why don't we move things up?

699
00:57:10,136 --> 00:57:11,470
Happy Blood Day.

700
00:57:12,721 --> 00:57:16,225
You'll drink blood filled with love
and become human.

701
00:57:23,399 --> 00:57:26,402
SHADED OASIS GUEST HOUSE

702
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:39,748
Woo-hyeol, are you feeling better?

703
00:58:12,406 --> 00:58:14,241
Your call cannot be completed
at this time.

704
00:58:14,325 --> 00:58:16,327
You will be redirected to voicemail.

705
00:58:19,205 --> 00:58:20,956
What's going on?

706
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:32,092
Have you seen Woo-hyeol?

707
00:58:32,176 --> 00:58:33,219
He isn't in the basement.

708
00:58:33,677 --> 00:58:34,720
Woo-hyeol is gone.

709
00:58:35,471 --> 00:58:37,640
What do you mean he's gone?

710
00:58:38,474 --> 00:58:40,100
He left the house.

711
00:58:43,646 --> 00:58:44,855
He went to die.

712
00:58:45,064 --> 00:58:46,774
Sang-hae, shut it!

713
00:58:47,316 --> 00:58:48,400
What are you talking about?

714
00:58:48,484 --> 00:58:49,443
But I'm right.

715
00:58:50,444 --> 00:58:52,196
Butler Joo should know the truth.

716
00:58:52,279 --> 00:58:55,074
Should we pretend otherwise
when Woo-hyeol's dying?

717
00:58:58,953 --> 00:59:00,204
Why is Woo-hyeol dying?

718
00:59:01,038 --> 00:59:01,956
Damn it.

719
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:10,673
He couldn't suck you dry
of your blood to become human,

720
00:59:11,507 --> 00:59:13,259
so he went to die alone.

721
00:59:13,342 --> 00:59:14,885
No, Woo-hyeol.

722
00:59:28,274 --> 00:59:29,275
Woo-hyeol.

723
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:32,778
How can you leave like this?

724
01:00:39,011 --> 01:00:41,930
HEARTBEAT

725
01:00:42,014 --> 01:00:43,807
We can't have a vampire among us.

726
01:00:43,891 --> 01:00:45,267
Leave this neighborhood!

727
01:00:45,351 --> 01:00:46,769
Let's see how long you can hold out.

728
01:00:47,186 --> 01:00:49,605
Let's sell the house and leave.

729
01:00:49,688 --> 01:00:51,523
I'm going to wait for Woo-hyeol here.

730
01:00:51,774 --> 01:00:53,650
