HEARTBEAT

2
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:46,964
ALL CHARACTERS, NAMES,
ORGANIZATIONS, GROUPS, EVENTS,

3
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,258
AND SETTINGS ARE FICTITIOUS
AND ANIMAL SAFETY GUIDELINES WERE FOLLOWED

4
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:05,316
Long ago,

5
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:07,902
immortal beings lived on this land.

6
00:01:09,153 --> 00:01:12,907
And there were greedy humans
who sought to obtain immortality

7
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,909
by drinking their blood.

8
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:16,494
Get them! Over there!

9
00:01:18,496 --> 00:01:19,580
Do not let them get away!

10
00:01:43,813 --> 00:01:44,814
Let's go.

11
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:54,406
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

12
00:02:30,276 --> 00:02:32,319
My lord, I brought what you requested.

13
00:02:33,404 --> 00:02:36,824
The arrowhead is made of silver,
which is deadly to vampires,

14
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:39,034
and the shaft is made of hawthorn wood.

15
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,201
Woo-hyeol.

16
00:03:26,457 --> 00:03:27,499
Are you okay?

17
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:30,419
Oh, no.

18
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:31,629
That must hurt.

19
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:40,220
You should run. Hurry.

20
00:03:42,056 --> 00:03:43,057
You have to.

21
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:46,060
They will never stop chasing you
now that they know what you are.

22
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:49,188
I'll be fine, so you should go.

23
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:50,814
Hurry!

24
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:05,329
No...

25
00:04:47,705 --> 00:04:49,832
What are you doing? Shoot him down!

26
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:02,302
Bring him down!

27
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:03,887
Capture that monster!

28
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:23,092
No!

29
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:52,579
"Seon Woo-hyeol."

30
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:55,749
"He was our good friend."

31
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,212
"We will never forget him."

32
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:04,216
"He was our leader."

33
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:07,302
"A good-looking and fashionable leader."

34
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:11,473
"Despite being surrounded by women
all the time,

35
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:13,475
he was ungrateful and..."

36
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:14,768
What?

37
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:21,608
"He was a very friendly person."

38
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:24,403
"Even if he leaves us,

39
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:28,949
the memories of him
will forever remain in our hearts

40
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:31,410
and long for him."

41
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:34,204
"Therefore,

42
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:38,375
I plan on keeping
one of his favorite coats

43
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,502
so that I can remember him forever."

44
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:43,505
- Seop, you choose one too.
- I'm good.

45
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:45,841
Didn't you say Woo-hyeol's hat was cool?

46
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:48,051
That's only because he was wearing it.

47
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,387
My head is too big for it.

48
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,222
Who cares?

49
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:54,266
Just take it and worry about that later.

50
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:56,560
No, I'm really good. Hats aren't for me.

51
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,478
Then take it and give it to me later.

52
00:07:58,562 --> 00:08:00,272
That seems a little unnecessary.

53
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:02,232
- Then...
- I asked for a memorial ceremony,

54
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:03,609
but you're plotting treason?

55
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:05,944
When did you fly over there?

56
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,115
Woo-hyeol, you shouldn't be sitting there.

57
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:11,992
We haven't gotten
to the most important part.

58
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:13,785
You.

59
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:17,873
Will you sell this house once I'm gone?

60
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,210
You're hurting my feelings.

61
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,795
Woo-hyeol, it's me, Lee Sang-hae.

62
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:26,381
You and I go back more than 130 years.

63
00:08:26,465 --> 00:08:28,217
- Do you still not trust me?
- No.

64
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,385
I see. Forget it then!

65
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:31,511
Don't pick it up!

66
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:34,139
Do you know how much effort
I put into this eulogy?

67
00:08:34,223 --> 00:08:37,100
I even got a nosebleed
staying up for three days to write this!

68
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:39,186
I put my soul into each and every letter.

69
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:41,188
How can you do this to me?

70
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:45,692
Butler Joo.

71
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,194
He ignored me.

72
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:50,656
You're the only one
I can trust with this house.

73
00:08:58,622 --> 00:08:59,706
Please take good care of it.

74
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,962
Consider it done, sir.

75
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,838
I am forever at your service.

76
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:10,217
Let go. Woo-hyeol.

77
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,969
Let me ask you something.

78
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:14,263
I've been curious since day one.

79
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:16,390
Why are you so desperate to become human?

80
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:18,558
You're asking me that now?

81
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:21,103
Answer me.

82
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:24,147
Why are you trying so hard
to become human?

83
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,322
That's because...

84
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,535
Butler Joo.

85
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,126
I'll tell you once I become human.

86
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:46,920
Come on. I'm dying to know!

87
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:48,839
I really don't think this will work.

88
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,966
- We are vampires.
- What is the matter with you?

89
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:54,803
We must drink human blood to survive.

90
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:57,180
People fear us.

91
00:09:58,307 --> 00:09:59,308
But...

92
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:01,518
we aren't much different from these guys.

93
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:06,648
Mosquitoes don't suck people's blood
until they die.

94
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:10,193
Similarly, we don't suck people's blood

95
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:11,653
until they die.

96
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:23,081
This much is all we need.

97
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,090
Consuming less also extends your lifespan.

98
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,770
We hate the sun,

99
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:47,522
but we sometimes do go outside
during the day.

100
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:09,419
Exposure to the sun

101
00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:11,088
increases blood consumption.

102
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:14,466
So we need to drink blood more often.

103
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:22,182
Do we have superpowers?

104
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:25,977
We can fly and are strong.

105
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:27,479
But we don't use our powers outside

106
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,981
since we have to blend in.

107
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:34,569
Why can't he clean with us?
He's so annoying.

108
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,449
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

109
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:45,122
Our powers do come in handy when cleaning.

110
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:50,544
All right.

111
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:54,464
Goodness, you look exquisite.

112
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:56,883
You have such a well-proportioned body.

113
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,344
You love looking in the mirror, don't you?

114
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:01,012
Do you like the suit?

115
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:02,347
How would I know?

116
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:05,725
Unfortunately,

117
00:12:06,268 --> 00:12:08,812
we can't see our reflection

118
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,523
in the mirror.

119
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:12,858
I love it.

120
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:17,195
Thank you.

121
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:38,008
As time went by,
vampires were forgotten by humans.

122
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,261
Therefore, we were able
to blend in with humans

123
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:44,097
and carry on with our lives.

124
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:45,682
He's so handsome.

125
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,142
Look at him.

126
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:51,938
He's so handsome.

127
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:57,027
- He's so good-looking.
- He looked at me.

128
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:01,031
I'm just too popular.

129
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,407
They aren't looking at you.

130
00:13:02,908 --> 00:13:04,534
Woo-hyeol and I aren't too different.

131
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:06,161
We both have two eyes and a nose.

132
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:09,206
But the arrangement is different.

133
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:10,332
Arrangement?

134
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:11,917
You're ugly.

135
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:22,928
Please.

136
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,643
Butler Joo, can we make it in time?

137
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:36,274
We can.

138
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:39,402
That person might come today.

139
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:25,782
They will come one day.

HEARTBEAT
EPISODE 1

141
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:38,795
Shaded Oasis.

142
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:42,299
The most popular spot in Gyeongseong

143
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,050
that means "a shelter from the sun."

144
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,596
Those who love the night more than the day

145
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:50,056
gather here night after night.

146
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:49,491
Look at those moves!

147
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:52,577
Vampire hunters are no more.

148
00:15:52,661 --> 00:15:55,997
But vampires still exist
living among humans,

149
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:58,750
under everyone's nose.

150
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:15,517
Butler Joo, I need a strong drink.

151
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,685
A strong one.

152
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:19,354
A soft cocktail.

153
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:23,608
A strong cocktail.

154
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,194
The woman killer.

155
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:27,779
Don't mix them up.

156
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:40,083
Have a drink.

157
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:44,003
I think I'm a bit drunk.

158
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:45,588
That's even better.

159
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:47,716
It makes the night more enjoyable.

160
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:49,134
Sorry?

161
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:50,802
It's nothing. Drink up.

162
00:16:56,975 --> 00:16:58,309
Is there a girl?

163
00:16:58,393 --> 00:16:59,978
Do I have a girlfriend?

164
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:02,063
Believe it or not, I'm single.

165
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:04,441
- My girlfriend is...
- That's not what I meant.

166
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:07,068
The owner.

167
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:14,242
Don't mind him.

168
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:16,661
We can go somewhere quiet and...

169
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,457
Let's go out. Give me a...

170
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,752
Stop bothering me like a dung fly
and get lost, will you?

171
00:17:23,835 --> 00:17:24,878
A dung fly?

172
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:27,213
- If I'm a dung fly, then you must be dung!
- What?

173
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:28,882
- Dung?
- You smell like it!

174
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:30,258
- What?
- Hey!

175
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:32,343
Stop slacking off and get back to work.

176
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:34,262
- That hurts.
- Does it?

177
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,097
Excuse me.

178
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:37,474
- Follow me.
- You have no eyes for men!

179
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:42,604
Sir.

180
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:47,525
How are you so handsome?

181
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:49,235
How can you be so perfect?

182
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:50,403
Do you have a girlfriend?

183
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:54,032
If you'll excuse me, ladies.

184
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:10,215
They didn't come today either.

185
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:31,986
What are you doing?

186
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:33,780
I clearly told you

187
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:36,449
that it's forbidden to suck human blood
at Shaded Oasis.

188
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:43,790
I didn't kill him.
I just had a little taste.

189
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:57,470
It's forbidden to suck human blood

190
00:18:58,388 --> 00:18:59,389
at Shaded Oasis.

191
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:03,977
Has Seon Woo-hyeol not given up yet?

192
00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:07,522
Becoming human? Jeez.

193
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:13,194
He even stopped drinking fresh blood.

194
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:16,114
A vampire who doesn't drink human blood?

195
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:18,700
How ridiculous.

196
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,423
How dare you talk about
Woo-hyeol that way?

197
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:36,843
Run your mouths again,

198
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:38,678
and I'll knock your fangs out.

199
00:20:16,007 --> 00:20:17,425
- Are you cold?
- I'm okay.

200
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:28,937
My long-time hobby is observing

201
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:30,688
humans in love.

202
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:34,359
- Here.
- Oh, my.

203
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:39,656
Thank you.

204
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:43,117
The flushed cheeks.

205
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:45,161
The red lips

206
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:46,788
that whisper love.

207
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:49,248
It's pretty.

208
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,127
Thump, thump.

209
00:20:55,213 --> 00:20:56,923
Your heart races,

210
00:20:58,132 --> 00:20:59,801
pumping blood

211
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:04,430
throughout your entire body.

212
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:08,726
It's fascinating.

213
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:28,079
My heart...

214
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:30,540
has never beaten once.

215
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,169
Because I've never been human,

216
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:37,755
I have never died,

217
00:21:39,382 --> 00:21:41,134
nor have I ever

218
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:43,052
actually lived.

219
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:45,304
They say that
just like how you only have one heart,

220
00:21:45,388 --> 00:21:47,473
you can truly only love one person.

221
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:53,354
What do you think true love is?

222
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:00,737
If your heart flutters,

223
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:03,489
does that mean it's true love?

224
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:08,286
If your heart flutters?

225
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:24,510
If your heart doesn't beat,

226
00:22:25,303 --> 00:22:27,764
does that mean you can't experience love
that makes your heart beat?

227
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:36,731
I wanted to know

228
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:40,151
what love that makes your heart beat

229
00:22:41,903 --> 00:22:42,945
felt like.

230
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,492
Since then,

231
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:50,787
I've tried everything to become human.

232
00:22:54,624 --> 00:22:57,001
I want to become human!

233
00:22:57,085 --> 00:23:01,589
- I want to become human!
- Woo-hyeol! Have you lost your mind?

234
00:23:03,758 --> 00:23:05,259
- Are you crazy?
- No!

235
00:23:05,343 --> 00:23:06,886
- It's so hot!
- Human!

236
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:10,348
Despite everyone calling me crazy,
I kept on going.

237
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:25,780
- Gosh, Woo-hyeol!
- Woo-hyeol!

238
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:27,615
Woo-hyeol! Seriously.

239
00:23:27,698 --> 00:23:29,700
- What's wrong with you?
- Come on!

240
00:23:29,784 --> 00:23:33,371
- Spit it out!
- Woo-hyeol! Why would you eat that?

241
00:23:34,288 --> 00:23:35,414
- Goodness.
- Gosh.

242
00:23:35,498 --> 00:23:38,417
- Why would you go this far?
- Is this really necessary?

243
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:22,879
Woo-hyeol, the Buddha must feel
uncomfortable. Stop it.

244
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:24,839
He should get some rest too.

245
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:26,924
Let's just pretend you became human.

246
00:24:27,008 --> 00:24:29,010
- You seem human enough now.
- You do.

247
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:35,266
Nothing was able to make me human.

248
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:56,287
You must've been really hungry.

249
00:24:58,789 --> 00:24:59,874
Do you like it?

250
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:04,253
Do you have makgeolli?

251
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:23,439
My taste has changed.

252
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:25,399
Do you like makgeolli?

253
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:27,944
- Mak...
- I'm Yang-nam.

254
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:30,821
Ko Yang-nam, as in "cat man."

255
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:44,418
Sure.

256
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:46,921
DUMPLINGS AND STEAMED BUNS

257
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:48,005
Cheers.

258
00:25:55,513 --> 00:25:57,014
You want to become human?

259
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:03,271
Yes, I want to become human.

260
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,439
Please tell me how.

261
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:07,817
You're almost 1 000 years old.

262
00:26:08,109 --> 00:26:10,653
Since you found out
how a cat becomes human,

263
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:14,156
you must also know
how a vampire becomes human.

264
00:26:15,533 --> 00:26:19,620
Why would you ask a cat about that?

265
00:26:20,121 --> 00:26:21,539
I'm just a cat.

266
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:23,791
A 1 000-year-old cat.

267
00:26:26,002 --> 00:26:29,088
Now I know why humans prefer dogs to cats.

268
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,464
What was that?

269
00:26:30,548 --> 00:26:31,716
I'll be going then.

270
00:26:33,676 --> 00:26:35,511
Why?

271
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:39,098
Why do you want to become human?

272
00:26:41,517 --> 00:26:43,978
- What do you care?
- So I can tell you how.

273
00:26:51,569 --> 00:26:52,695
Because of love.

274
00:26:54,572 --> 00:26:56,574
I want to experience love
that makes my heart beat.

275
00:26:57,074 --> 00:26:58,743
- Love?
- Yes.

276
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:05,458
I made a promise.

277
00:27:07,835 --> 00:27:09,253
That we would meet again

278
00:27:11,881 --> 00:27:13,466
and love each other with all our hearts.

279
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:24,393
Hae-sun.

280
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:31,442
I'm okay.

281
00:27:32,485 --> 00:27:33,736
I'm okay, Woo-hyeol.

282
00:27:35,237 --> 00:27:37,490
Just like how you only have one heart,

283
00:27:38,908 --> 00:27:42,453
you can only truly love one person.

284
00:27:44,372 --> 00:27:45,373
We...

285
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:48,459
will meet again.

286
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:54,924
I will come find you.

287
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:58,594
And when I do,

288
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:02,473
let's love each other with all our hearts.

289
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:06,519
Drink my blood...

290
00:28:09,772 --> 00:28:11,065
and remember me.

291
00:29:02,992 --> 00:29:04,326
Hawthorn coffin.

292
00:29:05,286 --> 00:29:06,287
What?

293
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,123
If you sleep

294
00:29:09,957 --> 00:29:13,085
in a hawthorn coffin for 100 years,
then you can become human.

295
00:29:18,841 --> 00:29:20,718
By hawthorn, do you mean...

296
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:24,638
That's right.
It's just as fatal to vampires as silver.

297
00:29:26,724 --> 00:29:29,226
Telling me to sleep in a hawthorn coffin
for 100 years

298
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:31,228
is the same as telling me to die.

299
00:29:31,312 --> 00:29:32,771
- Die.
- Sorry?

300
00:29:32,855 --> 00:29:34,064
Die.

301
00:29:34,857 --> 00:29:37,610
Die!

302
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:43,866
Only those who are ready to face death
will be given a new life.

303
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:47,620
Did you really think
you could become human that easily?

304
00:30:00,382 --> 00:30:02,927
Woo-hyeol, it's not a year or a decade.

305
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:05,721
It's a whole century.
Will you really be okay?

306
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,682
If I can really become human,

307
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:11,894
I would stay in there for 1 000 years.

308
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:13,521
You'll get bedsores.

309
00:30:13,771 --> 00:30:15,189
You talk too much.

310
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:17,942
From now on, think for three seconds

311
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:20,277
before you say something.

312
00:30:21,028 --> 00:30:22,071
Woo-hyeol.

313
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:23,822
I wasn't going to say this, but...

314
00:30:23,906 --> 00:30:24,907
Then don't.

315
00:30:25,199 --> 00:30:26,992
One, two, three. I think I should.

316
00:30:27,785 --> 00:30:29,161
Do you really believe that?

317
00:30:29,245 --> 00:30:31,413
A vampire becoming human
after sleeping for 100 years?

318
00:30:31,497 --> 00:30:32,873
It doesn't make any sense!

319
00:30:37,378 --> 00:30:38,504
I want to believe it.

320
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:43,342
As of now,

321
00:30:44,218 --> 00:30:45,636
this is the only way.

322
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,641
Also,

323
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:54,436
we'll see whether or not

324
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:56,272
it makes any sense.

325
00:30:58,566 --> 00:31:00,609
I'm immortal anyway.

326
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:03,904
What difference does it make
if I waste 100 years?

327
00:31:03,988 --> 00:31:05,864
That's a long time.

328
00:31:10,536 --> 00:31:11,579
Butler Joo.

329
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:14,123
Sang-hae, let's add more flowers.

330
00:31:15,165 --> 00:31:17,585
You won't be here when I wake up.

331
00:31:18,711 --> 00:31:20,879
I'm sorry I won't be
able to attend your funeral.

332
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:23,048
Have a good life.

333
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:25,217
Do not worry, sir.

334
00:31:25,718 --> 00:31:28,220
My descendants will continue
to protect this house.

335
00:31:29,096 --> 00:31:31,640
Even after I die,
my children, and their children,

336
00:31:31,724 --> 00:31:33,434
and their children, and their children...

337
00:31:35,144 --> 00:31:37,771
and their children
will protect this place.

338
00:31:39,023 --> 00:31:40,107
Thank you.

339
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:56,248
Woo-hyeol, hold on. Is this really it?

340
00:31:58,292 --> 00:31:59,418
I should go before the sun goes down.

341
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:00,586
Then that coat...

342
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:02,463
Never mind.

343
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:08,218
You even look ugly from up here.

344
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:09,637
Woo-hyeol.

345
00:32:10,179 --> 00:32:12,389
Don't you see Seop next to me?

346
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:14,433
Right. Dong-seop, give me a mirror.

347
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:15,601
Sure.

348
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:16,685
Here you go.

349
00:32:18,479 --> 00:32:19,647
Thanks, Butler Joo.

350
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:22,191
What do you need a mirror for?

351
00:32:24,652 --> 00:32:26,904
I'll look in the mirror
the moment I wake up.

352
00:32:28,072 --> 00:32:29,573
To see how good-looking I am.

353
00:32:29,657 --> 00:32:30,908
You'll be shocked.

354
00:32:34,036 --> 00:32:35,371
It's time.

355
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:38,457
I trust you, Butler Joo.

356
00:32:51,178 --> 00:32:53,597
See you in 100 years, my friends.

357
00:33:05,818 --> 00:33:06,819
Woo-hyeol.

358
00:33:08,112 --> 00:33:10,280
How are we going to live without him?

359
00:33:36,098 --> 00:33:37,516
Gosh, it's cold.

360
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,741
HEATER
ERROR

361
00:34:47,044 --> 00:34:50,714
SHAMAN

362
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:05,187
What is that?

363
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:07,731
Hold on.

364
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:11,985
The heater is broken again.

365
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:14,613
Don't you see I'm working?

366
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:15,823
We can talk later.

367
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:18,200
Later when? It's been days.

368
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:19,993
What if I catch a cold?

369
00:35:20,077 --> 00:35:21,537
Will you pay for my medical bill?

370
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,789
Fine. I get it.

371
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:25,082
For now,

372
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:28,669
go to the bathhouse with this money.

373
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:30,087
We'll talk again later.

374
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,006
I have to get back to work.

375
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:34,424
If my deity gets angry,

376
00:35:34,508 --> 00:35:35,759
I'll lose power.

377
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:40,806
Seriously.

378
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,809
Why is this all crumpled up?

379
00:35:46,562 --> 00:35:50,023
GONGCHEON HIGH SCHOOL

380
00:35:57,698 --> 00:35:59,241
Who the hell are you?

381
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:01,201
Hold on! Who are you?

382
00:36:01,285 --> 00:36:02,536
Why are you doing this?

383
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:04,037
What do you mean why?

384
00:36:04,121 --> 00:36:06,039
- Please let go!
- You.

385
00:36:06,123 --> 00:36:08,250
- Ma'am!
- You messed with the wrong person.

386
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:11,128
- Please let go!
- Gosh, that hurts!

387
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:13,589
What's going on?

388
00:36:14,006 --> 00:36:15,215
Goodness.

389
00:36:22,973 --> 00:36:24,850
She asked her to remove the gum
from her hair,

390
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:27,769
and look what she has done
to my daughter's hair!

391
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,272
What's a nurse's office for?

392
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:32,649
It's your job to clean up after the kids.

393
00:36:32,733 --> 00:36:34,026
Can't you do your job properly?

394
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:35,777
Ma'am, please calm down.

395
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:37,487
How can I calm down?

396
00:36:37,571 --> 00:36:39,656
Look at her hair!

397
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:41,575
I'm sorry, ma'am.

398
00:36:41,909 --> 00:36:44,244
Ms. Joo, apologize right now!

399
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:49,625
What should I apologize for?

400
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:53,921
- What?
- Ms. Joo!

401
00:36:54,004 --> 00:36:57,549
Also, the nurse's office isn't there
to clean up after the kids.

402
00:36:57,883 --> 00:37:01,261
It's there to educate the well-being of
the students and teachers by...

403
00:37:01,345 --> 00:37:03,263
You're not even a real teacher.

404
00:37:03,347 --> 00:37:05,766
You're a temp on a two-year contract.

405
00:37:06,642 --> 00:37:08,518
How dare you try to lecture me?

406
00:37:09,478 --> 00:37:12,522
If you messed up my dear daughter's hair,

407
00:37:12,606 --> 00:37:14,483
the first thing you should do
is apologize!

408
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:16,443
How dare you talk back to me?

409
00:37:17,277 --> 00:37:18,820
She's a sensitive adolescent right now,

410
00:37:18,904 --> 00:37:20,739
so I barely convince her to go to school.

411
00:37:20,822 --> 00:37:22,741
I told you that's not it!

412
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,995
You don't know anything.

413
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:34,252
I guess you aren't aware

414
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:36,755
that your dear daughter
is being bullied at school.

415
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,306
HEALTH TEACHER JOO IN-HAE

416
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:49,017
Na-rae came to see me recently.

417
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:55,607
I didn't ask her what happened.

418
00:37:57,317 --> 00:37:58,819
I didn't want to hurt her any further.

419
00:38:09,246 --> 00:38:10,789
That's why I cut her hair.

420
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:13,041
I thought her parents should know.

421
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,252
And that you'd pay her some attention.

422
00:38:18,922 --> 00:38:21,174
I'm relieved that you've found out.

423
00:38:21,675 --> 00:38:24,094
I apologize for messing up her hair.

424
00:38:24,428 --> 00:38:27,431
I was trained to be a nurse,
not a hairdresser.

425
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:29,975
Why didn't she tell me?

426
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:33,103
School violence
is such a big problem these days.

427
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:36,815
The school will do its best to prevent it,

428
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:39,860
but the parents should also
take interest in their kids.

429
00:39:19,149 --> 00:39:20,233
Perfect.

430
00:39:21,485 --> 00:39:24,488
DONG-SEOP SNACK SHOP

431
00:39:26,198 --> 00:39:27,324
Goodness.

432
00:39:29,576 --> 00:39:30,660
Hello, sir.

433
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:32,079
Look at this place.

434
00:39:33,622 --> 00:39:35,457
Still no customers?

435
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:37,417
That's right.

436
00:39:39,336 --> 00:39:40,629
You know what today is, right?

437
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:43,381
Of course, my rent is due today.

438
00:39:43,465 --> 00:39:45,634
I'll go to the bank later and pay in cash.

439
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:48,512
Just wire it. Cash is a hassle.

440
00:39:48,595 --> 00:39:51,640
Okay, sir.
I'll wire it to you later today.

441
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:52,933
Wire it by 6:00 p.m.

442
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:54,643
If you're even a minute late,

443
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:57,229
I'll rip that griddle out.

444
00:39:57,312 --> 00:39:59,397
Of course. You can rest assured.

445
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:02,025
Six o'clock, okay?

446
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:07,364
Goodbye, sir.

447
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:12,786
Goodness, money talks.

448
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:17,457
It makes you grovel to someone
who's still wet behind the ears.

449
00:40:17,541 --> 00:40:19,209
It's sad to watch.

450
00:40:21,795 --> 00:40:23,463
This is all because of you.

451
00:40:25,173 --> 00:40:28,635
If only you hadn't spent so much money
on gambling and failed businesses.

452
00:40:29,136 --> 00:40:31,513
If Woo-hyeol were to find out,
he'd jump out of his coffin.

453
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:34,224
Come on, let bygones be bygones.

454
00:40:34,307 --> 00:40:37,477
You can't move forward
if you remain stuck in the past.

455
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:39,938
- What did you say?
- I'm thirsty.

456
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:43,400
I have nothing to give you.
Even if I did, you'd have to pay.

457
00:40:45,152 --> 00:40:48,238
I don't even have money to pay my fees
to the Red Cross, let alone to buy blood.

458
00:40:49,531 --> 00:40:51,575
Gosh, you're so stingy.

459
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:56,746
I miss the good old days.

460
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:59,291
Without CCTVs and dash cams,

461
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:01,418
sucking human blood was a piece of cake.

462
00:41:01,501 --> 00:41:04,713
I don't even remember
what fresh blood tastes like.

463
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:09,634
Who knew we'd have to pay for blood?

464
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:13,889
Sang-hae, you should quit flipping cards

465
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:15,807
and learn something practical.

466
00:41:15,891 --> 00:41:18,560
It's not flipping cards.
I'm a tarot reader.

467
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:19,769
I told you already.

468
00:41:20,103 --> 00:41:23,815
To be blunt, I'd rather flip cards
than stir around food that no one wants.

469
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:28,862
You and I are both
an embarrassment to Woo-hyeol.

470
00:41:29,154 --> 00:41:31,072
He'll be so disappointed
to see us like this.

471
00:41:31,156 --> 00:41:32,824
What's wrong with us?

472
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:35,619
I doubt Woo-hyeol would have done
any better in this day and age.

473
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:39,789
If I knew this would happen,
I would've gone in a coffin too.

474
00:41:40,207 --> 00:41:41,208
Hold on.

475
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:44,336
Hey, there are only two days left.

476
00:41:45,712 --> 00:41:46,880
Do you think he's human now?

477
00:41:46,963 --> 00:41:49,216
Fat chance.
He's lucky if he didn't get bedsores.

478
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:02,812
Goodness, you startled me!

479
00:42:03,188 --> 00:42:04,564
Are you going somewhere?

480
00:42:04,648 --> 00:42:05,732
What?

481
00:42:06,233 --> 00:42:07,234
Well...

482
00:42:08,985 --> 00:42:11,029
I'm going out of town on business.

483
00:42:11,988 --> 00:42:13,198
On business?

484
00:42:13,281 --> 00:42:16,409
I often perform rituals in other regions.

485
00:42:16,493 --> 00:42:17,661
It'll take a few days.

486
00:42:18,078 --> 00:42:19,329
What about my heater?

487
00:42:21,081 --> 00:42:22,374
Oh, that?

488
00:42:22,999 --> 00:42:25,210
The handyman will come tomorrow morning.

489
00:42:26,169 --> 00:42:27,754
So please hang in there.

490
00:42:28,004 --> 00:42:30,257
Starting tomorrow,
you'll be able to live in warmth.

491
00:42:30,632 --> 00:42:31,967
Here, I promise.

492
00:42:32,509 --> 00:42:34,135
I pinky promise. Come on.

493
00:42:34,386 --> 00:42:35,845
Sealed.

494
00:42:36,721 --> 00:42:37,931
Can I trust you?

495
00:42:39,099 --> 00:42:40,183
My deity says yes.

496
00:42:42,352 --> 00:42:43,520
Have a safe trip.

497
00:43:24,978 --> 00:43:28,189
At least tell me
whether you're alive or not.

498
00:43:33,528 --> 00:43:34,946
Gosh, it's cold.

499
00:43:40,577 --> 00:43:42,287
REFRESH REAL ESTATE CONSULTING

500
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:44,956
CEO SHIN DO-SIK

501
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,583
This man is capable of

502
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:48,877
bringing any dying neighborhood
back to life.

503
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:51,629
May I touch your hand?

504
00:43:51,921 --> 00:43:52,922
Sorry?

505
00:43:53,006 --> 00:43:55,467
He really has the Midas touch.

506
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:58,428
Every place he touches
turns into a hot spot.

507
00:43:59,429 --> 00:44:00,889
You're truly extraordinary.

508
00:44:01,181 --> 00:44:03,391
People are saying

509
00:44:03,475 --> 00:44:05,643
that a doctor saves dying patients

510
00:44:05,727 --> 00:44:08,438
while Refresh Real Estate Consulting
saves dying neighborhoods.

511
00:44:08,938 --> 00:44:10,148
What do you think?

512
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:12,192
My work isn't comparable to saving lives,

513
00:44:12,484 --> 00:44:14,027
but I feel honored to hear that.

514
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:19,115
It feels rewarding that I can
make people happy by doing what I love.

515
00:44:19,199 --> 00:44:20,867
That's not all.

516
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:22,577
We also heard through the grapevine

517
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:27,082
that you've been supporting children
with heart disease for seven years now.

518
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:28,500
Well, that's...

519
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:31,544
I think our society can
take a step toward goodness

520
00:44:31,628 --> 00:44:34,339
when more people use their influence
to help others.

521
00:44:39,344 --> 00:44:41,012
Was that the last interview?

522
00:44:41,096 --> 00:44:42,138
Yes, sir.

523
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:45,392
Did the results come in?

524
00:44:45,475 --> 00:44:46,893
They found nothing wrong.

525
00:44:46,976 --> 00:44:49,562
Your blood tests and CT scan
came out fine.

526
00:44:50,063 --> 00:44:51,564
Then what's wrong with me?

527
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:54,192
I don't feel well.

528
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,861
You barely got any sleep
with the store opening and all.

529
00:44:56,945 --> 00:44:58,238
It makes sense you're tired.

530
00:44:58,822 --> 00:45:01,699
Right, did you purchase the house
in Sebuk-dong?

531
00:45:01,783 --> 00:45:04,327
Yes, we finalized the purchase
a few days ago,

532
00:45:04,411 --> 00:45:06,246
and we're scheduling
the renovation right now.

533
00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:08,581
Make sure to purchase
all the valuable land nearby.

534
00:45:08,665 --> 00:45:11,584
It's important to acquire the land
before the area gets developed.

535
00:45:11,668 --> 00:45:12,669
Yes, sir.

536
00:45:26,266 --> 00:45:27,267
What?

537
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:28,435
Why is this door locked?

538
00:45:30,645 --> 00:45:31,646
Hello?

539
00:45:32,355 --> 00:45:33,731
Is someone in there?

540
00:45:34,524 --> 00:45:35,525
Hello?

541
00:45:38,445 --> 00:45:40,947
Hello? Is someone in there?

542
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:46,244
Are you here to fix the heater?

543
00:45:46,327 --> 00:45:47,704
- Come on in.
- Sorry?

544
00:45:48,288 --> 00:45:50,206
Did your landlord not tell you?

545
00:45:50,498 --> 00:45:51,666
We're tearing this place down.

546
00:45:52,125 --> 00:45:53,209
What?

547
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:03,761
REAL ESTATE OFFICE

548
00:46:12,103 --> 00:46:15,982
TEMPORARILY CLOSED

549
00:46:16,357 --> 00:46:17,400
LANDLORD

550
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:27,785
Your call cannot be completed
at this time.

551
00:46:27,869 --> 00:46:29,704
You will be redirected to voicemail.

552
00:46:37,754 --> 00:46:39,297
Eight previous convictions of fraud.

553
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:42,884
He's a habitual offender.

554
00:46:45,178 --> 00:46:46,262
This is him, right?

555
00:46:48,723 --> 00:46:49,891
He's no joke.

556
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:53,394
He pretended to be a pastor, monk, priest,

557
00:46:53,478 --> 00:46:55,063
and now a shaman.

558
00:46:55,355 --> 00:46:57,398
He once even shaved his head
to look like a monk.

559
00:46:57,774 --> 00:46:59,192
Is he a son of God or what?

560
00:47:00,693 --> 00:47:02,529
What about my money?

561
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,155
What about my deposit?

562
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:07,367
We have to catch him before anything.

563
00:47:07,867 --> 00:47:09,494
But it's not easy.

564
00:47:10,078 --> 00:47:12,121
What are you talking about?

565
00:47:12,205 --> 00:47:15,375
Even if we catch him,
if he says he doesn't have the money,

566
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:17,377
there's not much we can do.

567
00:47:19,337 --> 00:47:21,214
- I mean...
- You should go home for now.

568
00:47:21,297 --> 00:47:23,091
We'll look into it and let you know.

569
00:47:25,301 --> 00:47:27,637
I have no home to return to.

570
00:47:32,267 --> 00:47:36,604
SEOHAN BANK

571
00:47:41,067 --> 00:47:44,529
Unfortunately, you don't have
a guarantee insurance.

572
00:47:44,612 --> 00:47:47,282
So there's not much we can do to help you.

573
00:47:48,908 --> 00:47:51,619
Would it be possible
to take out another loan?

574
00:47:52,412 --> 00:47:54,414
I'll have to pay a deposit

575
00:47:54,497 --> 00:47:56,249
if I were to find another place to stay.

576
00:47:57,458 --> 00:47:59,919
My salary is paid into this account.

577
00:48:00,503 --> 00:48:02,422
And this bank is the main one I use.

578
00:48:02,839 --> 00:48:04,507
Is there a way?

579
00:48:13,808 --> 00:48:15,059
I'm sorry, ma'am.

580
00:48:15,143 --> 00:48:18,229
You've already reached your loan limit
with your previous loan,

581
00:48:18,313 --> 00:48:19,814
so I'm afraid there isn't.

582
00:48:32,619 --> 00:48:33,703
Ma'am.

583
00:48:35,747 --> 00:48:36,831
Here.

584
00:48:39,834 --> 00:48:41,002
Thank you.

585
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:48,051
BEWARE OF HOUSING FRAUDS...

586
00:48:57,810 --> 00:49:00,813
THE NEWTRO LEADER, CEO SHIN DO-SIK
OF REFRESH REAL ESTATE CONSULTING

587
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:04,192
REFRESH REAL ESTATE CONSULTING

588
00:49:08,905 --> 00:49:11,032
- Hello?
- Is this Ms. Joo In-hae?

589
00:49:11,115 --> 00:49:13,201
Yes. Did you catch him?

590
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:16,621
Sorry?

591
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:23,544
According to the will
left by Mr. Joo Dong-il,

592
00:49:23,628 --> 00:49:24,921
I will execute his will.

593
00:49:25,755 --> 00:49:27,507
Mr. Joo Dong-il, your father,

594
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:29,217
has been declared legally dead

595
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:30,843
after five years of being missing.

596
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:33,930
His assets will be inherited by you,

597
00:49:34,263 --> 00:49:35,723
his only heir.

598
00:49:41,437 --> 00:49:43,398
If I'm inheriting his assets,

599
00:49:44,732 --> 00:49:46,943
does that also include debt?

600
00:49:47,402 --> 00:49:49,737
My financial situation
isn't great right now.

601
00:49:49,821 --> 00:49:51,447
Oh, don't worry.

602
00:49:52,323 --> 00:49:54,325
He doesn't have any debt.

603
00:49:54,409 --> 00:49:59,706
He has some money deposited in the bank
as well as an old mansion in his name.

604
00:50:18,057 --> 00:50:19,392
HOLOGRAPHIC WILL

605
00:50:19,475 --> 00:50:22,520
I LEAVE MY ASSETS
TO MY DAUGHTER, JOO IN-HAE...

606
00:50:24,355 --> 00:50:26,399
DATE: DECEMBER 20TH, 2015
TESTATOR: JOO DONG-IL

607
00:55:31,746 --> 00:55:33,414
What is this?

608
00:56:01,275 --> 00:56:02,318
What the...

609
00:56:36,227 --> 00:56:37,269
What was that?

610
00:56:40,231 --> 00:56:41,357
What's going on?

611
00:56:58,249 --> 00:56:59,375
Don't come near me!

612
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:01,836
Don't come near me! Stay away!

613
00:57:09,802 --> 00:57:10,803
Hey.

614
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:27,987
Descendant of Butler Joo.

615
00:57:28,487 --> 00:57:29,864
Do not be frightened.

616
00:57:29,947 --> 00:57:31,240
I am now human.

617
00:57:33,784 --> 00:57:34,827
Stop!

618
00:57:34,910 --> 00:57:38,038
Stop right there.
You can talk from where you're standing.

619
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:43,252
What did you just say?

620
00:57:43,836 --> 00:57:45,546
Butler? Descendant?

621
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:47,339
What does all that mean?

622
00:57:51,135 --> 00:57:53,721
Don't tell me you don't know about me.

623
00:57:53,804 --> 00:57:54,847
Who are you?

624
00:57:56,974 --> 00:57:58,434
Seon Woo-hyeol.

625
00:57:58,976 --> 00:58:01,770
- That is my name.
- I'm not asking for your name.

626
00:58:01,854 --> 00:58:05,524
I'm the true owner of this house.

627
00:58:06,317 --> 00:58:07,401
What are you saying?

628
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,570
I met with a lawyer and checked
the certified copy of the register.

629
00:58:09,653 --> 00:58:10,696
What is your name?

630
00:58:12,198 --> 00:58:13,866
- Joo In-hae.
- Joo In-hae.

631
00:58:14,241 --> 00:58:16,243
- You've done a good job.
- Sorry?

632
00:58:16,327 --> 00:58:18,037
Thank you for protecting this house

633
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:21,081
while I was asleep for 100 years.

634
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,337
I was able to become human
thanks to Butler Joo

635
00:58:26,879 --> 00:58:29,423
and his children,
and their children, and their children,

636
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:31,926
and their children,
and their children, and their children...

637
00:58:32,801 --> 00:58:34,553
and their children.

638
00:58:37,139 --> 00:58:38,140
All right.

639
00:58:38,224 --> 00:58:39,308
Tell me.

640
00:58:39,391 --> 00:58:42,895
I will grant you a wish
to celebrate my becoming human.

641
00:58:42,978 --> 00:58:44,688
- Please get out.
- What?

642
00:58:44,772 --> 00:58:47,650
Get out of this house
before I call the cops!

643
00:58:48,234 --> 00:58:49,360
Hold on!

644
00:58:49,777 --> 00:58:50,778
What?

645
00:59:04,333 --> 00:59:05,542
You crazy bastard!

646
00:59:11,674 --> 00:59:13,550
This shouldn't be happening.

647
00:59:13,884 --> 00:59:14,885
What?

648
00:59:17,304 --> 00:59:18,305
Mirror.

649
00:59:18,389 --> 00:59:19,515
I need to look in a mirror.

650
00:59:22,434 --> 00:59:23,519
Hey!

651
00:59:39,868 --> 00:59:40,869
What?

652
00:59:49,461 --> 00:59:51,005
Why is he being so creepy?

653
00:59:56,844 --> 00:59:57,845
Why?

654
00:59:58,429 --> 00:59:59,763
What happened?

655
01:00:02,766 --> 01:00:04,560
- It can't be...
- Listen!

656
01:00:05,019 --> 01:00:07,730
Why do you keep touching me?

657
01:00:09,023 --> 01:00:10,649
- What's the date today?
- What?

658
01:00:11,025 --> 01:00:14,153
Isn't today December 9th, Year 4355,
of the Dangun calendar?

659
01:00:14,236 --> 01:00:16,030
It's not the ninth, but the eighth!

660
01:00:18,991 --> 01:00:20,075
The eighth?

661
01:00:28,292 --> 01:00:29,752
It hasn't been 100 years then.

662
01:00:31,587 --> 01:00:32,796
I'm one day short.

663
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:37,718
I woke up a day early.

664
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:52,983
Hello? Is this the police?

665
01:00:53,067 --> 01:00:55,361
I'd like to report a break-in
in Gongcheon-dong.

666
01:00:55,444 --> 01:00:56,695
A pervert...

667
01:00:59,114 --> 01:01:00,157
Seriously?

668
01:01:00,491 --> 01:01:01,825
What do you think you're doing?

669
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:04,536
What's your deal?

670
01:01:06,372 --> 01:01:08,040
Why did you wake me up?!

671
01:01:11,418 --> 01:01:14,880
Why are you yelling at me?

672
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:16,131
You...

673
01:01:17,091 --> 01:01:18,342
broke the promise.

674
01:01:18,425 --> 01:01:19,510
What promise?

675
01:01:22,596 --> 01:01:23,722
Do you know...

676
01:01:25,265 --> 01:01:26,475
how much I suffered...

677
01:01:27,184 --> 01:01:28,811
in that coffin?

678
01:01:30,479 --> 01:01:32,231
You ruined everything.

679
01:01:36,944 --> 01:01:38,153
It's all your fault.

680
01:01:40,614 --> 01:01:42,449
You will be punished

681
01:01:44,493 --> 01:01:45,619
for waking me up.

682
01:02:09,393 --> 01:02:12,563
THANKS TO PARK IN-HWAN, PARK CHUL-MIN,
AND KIM BA-DA FOR THEIR SPECIAL APPEARANCE

683
01:02:29,246 --> 01:02:32,082
HEARTBEAT

684
01:02:32,624 --> 01:02:34,209
Reacting to food that isn't blood?

685
01:02:34,293 --> 01:02:36,378
Don't tell me you're drunk.
You're drunk on noodles?

686
01:02:36,462 --> 01:02:38,213
My instinct to suck blood still remains.

687
01:02:38,672 --> 01:02:40,883
I can't believe how one can spew
such detailed nonsense.

688
01:02:40,966 --> 01:02:42,801
You're neither a vampire
nor a human being.

689
01:02:42,885 --> 01:02:44,178
Darn it!

690
01:02:44,261 --> 01:02:45,679
I said, get lost!

691
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:47,014
I woke up after 100 years

692
01:02:47,681 --> 01:02:49,433
but haven't been able to drink
a drop of blood.

693
01:02:49,516 --> 01:02:50,601
I feel so weak.

694
01:02:50,684 --> 01:02:52,060
What if someone gets hurt?

695
01:02:52,144 --> 01:02:53,353
Can I hold you accountable?

696
01:02:53,437 --> 01:02:54,480
Are you okay?

697
01:02:54,730 --> 01:02:56,064
Do-sik?

698
01:02:56,523 --> 01:02:57,941
Stop right there!

699
01:02:58,275 --> 01:02:59,735
Something must've happened.

700
01:02:59,818 --> 01:03:01,069
Shouldn't we look for him?

701
01:03:01,153 --> 01:03:03,030
Keep her by your side
and keep an eye on her.

702
01:03:03,113 --> 01:03:04,490
She might be the one holding the key.
