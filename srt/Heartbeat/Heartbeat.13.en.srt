ALL CHARACTERS, NAMES,
ORGANIZATIONS, GROUPS, EVENTS,

3
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,383
AND SETTINGS ARE FICTITIOUS
AND ANIMAL SAFETY GUIDELINES WERE FOLLOWED

4
00:00:52,428 --> 00:00:55,347
I see you both have a death wish.

5
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:07,818
Butler Joo, are you all right?

6
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,879
Hey, stop right there!

7
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:34,804
Woo-hyeol.

8
00:02:02,498 --> 00:02:03,582
Stay away from her!

9
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:06,335
In-hae.

10
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:08,003
In-hae.

11
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:09,421
In-hae, are you all right?

12
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:11,006
In-hae.

13
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:12,132
Stay with me.

14
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:14,593
In-hae.

EPISODE 13

16
00:03:03,726 --> 00:03:04,894
Woo-hyeol...

17
00:03:39,345 --> 00:03:40,679
Love that makes your heart beat?

18
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:43,265
Do you believe
that a blood-sucking vampire

19
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:45,935
could ever fall in love?

20
00:03:46,477 --> 00:03:47,645
You're a monster.

21
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:21,762
I can't harm Butler Joo.

22
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:25,557
Never.

23
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:35,234
What happened to this place?

24
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:38,320
We just cleaned up,
and it's already become a mess.

25
00:04:38,404 --> 00:04:39,321
Woo-hyeol!

26
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:40,614
Butler Joo!

27
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:43,575
Where did they go
after making such a mess?

28
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:46,328
You don't think
they fought or anything, do you?

29
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:48,414
What are you talking about?

30
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:50,916
No way.

31
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:18,402
In-hae.

32
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:21,321
Are you okay?

33
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:24,199
Do-sik?

34
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:28,328
What happened?

35
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:33,375
You have a mild concussion.

36
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:36,253
You should rest for a few days
just in case.

37
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:38,297
Thank you, Do-sik.

38
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:39,882
Where's Woo-hyeol?

39
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:47,681
You're looking for him
even in this situation?

40
00:05:49,475 --> 00:05:51,685
Do you not remember
the way he was looking at you earlier?

41
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:53,854
What do you...

42
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:55,272
You almost died.

43
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:58,192
He tried to drink your blood.

44
00:06:01,737 --> 00:06:03,030
That can't be.

45
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:06,241
He would never do that.

46
00:06:06,784 --> 00:06:08,327
- In-hae.
- If he wanted to kill me,

47
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,661
he would've done so already.

48
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:12,539
Trust me.

49
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:14,541
You're mistaken.

50
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:15,459
No.

51
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:17,711
I'm telling you what I saw.

52
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:19,505
Now that I've seen it,

53
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:21,131
I can't just sit back.

54
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,841
Do-sik.

55
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:25,219
It's dangerous to be by his side.

56
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,888
You must leave the mansion.

57
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:28,972
I'll help you.

58
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:05,092
I still haven't heard anything from her.

59
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:08,846
I'm worried.

60
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:55,559
SEON WOO-HYEOL

61
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:15,954
Hello?

62
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:19,249
Why are you calling at this hour?

63
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:21,460
I was

64
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,004
getting worried.

65
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:27,507
She needs absolute rest,
so please don't call her.

66
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:29,509
Can you at least tell me
which hospital she's in?

67
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:32,179
- In case--
- You can't be serious.

68
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:33,764
Not after I found out what you are

69
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:36,225
and what you want from In-hae.

70
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:40,520
Don't even think about coming near her.

71
00:08:40,896 --> 00:08:41,730
Just get lost.

72
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:53,951
SEON WOO-HYEOL
DELETE

73
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:12,344
So how about we settle on a date?

74
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:15,264
A date?

75
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:16,765
Blood filled with love.

76
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,726
You said you can become human
if you drink it.

77
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:21,645
When will be good for you?

78
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:24,314
Are you really
going to give me your blood?

79
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,609
It's something you desperately desired.

80
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:30,988
Turning human and experiencing love
that makes your heart beat.

81
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:35,951
I'd love to be of help.

82
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:40,289
Between you and Butler Joo,

83
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:43,083
only one can live.

84
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:45,043
To become human,

85
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:47,587
you must suck her dry of her blood.

86
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:04,813
If we can't be together

87
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:07,983
and one of us has to die...

88
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:15,407
It has to be...

89
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:19,286
me.

90
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:37,471
I have to kill who?

91
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,848
I know how difficult this is for you.

92
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:41,350
- But--
- But what?

93
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:44,311
Are you telling me
to suck her dry of her blood

94
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:46,438
and become human?

95
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:48,440
- Are you--
- I wanted to become human

96
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,817
and experience love
that makes my heart beat.

97
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:54,196
But I can't take someone else's life
to do that.

98
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:55,739
Especially if that person

99
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:57,741
is Butler Joo.

100
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:01,411
Listen.

101
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,456
How long do you think
I'll be able to help you?

102
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:08,335
Let's not make any more mistakes
that can't be undone.

103
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:12,297
Nothing you say

104
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:14,549
will change my mind.

105
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:17,177
Don't come to see me again.

106
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:35,779
I'm to blame for all this.

107
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,832
How will I pay for what I've done?

108
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,689
Woo-hyeol, what are you doing there?

109
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:14,109
Hey.

110
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:18,113
I couldn't fall asleep.

111
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:23,910
What was with the mess yesterday?

112
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:25,120
Did something happen?

113
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:27,956
You didn't get into a fight
with Butler Joo, did you?

114
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:30,917
There was an incident.

115
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:35,046
A man broke in and made a scene.

116
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:37,841
What happened to Butler Joo?

117
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:41,678
She's in the hospital.

118
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:49,728
Shouldn't you be with her?

119
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,024
Do-sik is taking good care of her.

120
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:54,941
I see.

121
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:56,401
But still...

122
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:01,907
- Dong-seop.
- Yes?

123
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:03,825
What do you think...

124
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:06,995
would have happened

125
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:11,791
if I had woken up a human?

126
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:14,252
Can I be honest?

127
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:15,587
Please.

128
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:20,592
I would've been happy

129
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:24,137
but sad at the same time.

130
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,515
Why?

131
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:28,391
I'd be thrilled because you'd be able to

132
00:13:28,934 --> 00:13:31,686
experience love that makes your heart beat

133
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:33,438
like you've always wanted.

134
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:35,941
But if you become human,

135
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:38,610
you aren't immortal anymore.

136
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:40,487
And that means when you grow old

137
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:43,156
and eventually leave us,

138
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,910
I won't be able to see you again.

139
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:53,333
Then you should thank Butler Joo,

140
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:54,543
not blame her,

141
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:57,921
for waking me up one day too early.

142
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:00,298
Sure, I guess so.

143
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:02,509
What is it? Are you having regrets?

144
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:03,885
No.

145
00:14:05,971 --> 00:14:07,097
I'm glad.

146
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:09,516
If she hadn't woken me up,

147
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,311
I wouldn't have met her.

148
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:17,607
Then I would never have felt

149
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:19,776
the way I do now.

150
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:32,289
Woo-hyeol.

151
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:34,416
Goodness.

152
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:36,459
All right.

153
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:41,256
Isn't it too early to be hugging?

154
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:43,758
All right.

155
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:48,054
- Woo-hyeol.
- Goodness.

156
00:14:58,273 --> 00:15:00,483
Do you not remember
the way he was looking at you earlier?

157
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,277
You almost died.

158
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:04,696
He tried to drink your blood.

159
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:07,907
No.

160
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:11,286
It can't be.

161
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:27,093
In-hae.

162
00:15:29,304 --> 00:15:31,723
Do-sik, thank you for taking care of me.

163
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:33,933
I'm going to head back home.

164
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:35,226
What do you mean?

165
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:36,686
You're a patient who needs rest.

166
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,104
I'm okay.

167
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:39,064
I'm completely fine.

168
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:40,774
You're not.

169
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:41,941
You don't look fine at all.

170
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:44,361
Are you seriously going to go back there?

171
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:47,280
- Do-sik.
- I can't let you go back.

172
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:49,115
I told you it's dangerous.

173
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,075
No.

174
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:52,702
I don't intend on leaving that house.

175
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:01,044
Are you really

176
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:04,297
in love with a vampire or something?

177
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:09,302
That monster is after your blood
to become human.

178
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:14,391
You're being deceived by him.

179
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:17,060
He doesn't love you.

180
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:19,979
He's using you to become human.

181
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:22,148
He has to suck you dry of your blood
to become human.

182
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:23,483
Watch what you say.

183
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:26,236
You don't know him.

184
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,488
You're the one who doesn't.
Come to your senses!

185
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:37,288
I'm not asking you to like me.

186
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:40,291
It doesn't have to be me.

187
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:42,752
But not Seon Woo-hyeol.

188
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,504
You'll be in danger.

189
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:48,174
I'm sorry, Do-sik.

190
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:54,222
I've lived my life
only caring about myself until now.

191
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:59,477
I never had the luxury
of having feelings for someone.

192
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,315
I understand your concern.

193
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:08,862
And I know you're saying this for me.

194
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:11,239
- But--
- That's enough.

195
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,950
I like being with Woo-hyeol.

196
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,160
In-hae.

197
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:17,370
He's not the one who needs me.

198
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,415
I need him.

199
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:25,336
I've been living as if I'm dead until now.

200
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:29,549
But I'm not going to
live like that anymore.

201
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:33,720
I want to follow

202
00:17:34,763 --> 00:17:35,889
where my heart leads me.

203
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:17,764
I got scared

204
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,683
that something might happen to you.

205
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,353
I was scared

206
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:27,816
that I might not be
able to see you again....

207
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:29,901
like my mom and dad.

208
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:35,114
I want you to stay by my side
for a long time

209
00:18:35,907 --> 00:18:38,701
and never go anywhere.

210
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:42,247
I think I'd be devastated

211
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,583
if you weren't in this world.

212
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:56,553
Come out for a second.

213
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:05,478
I'm here to give this back to you.

214
00:19:06,437 --> 00:19:08,648
I don't think I should keep it.

215
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:10,567
May I ask

216
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:13,111
why?

217
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,238
I can't bear to look at it.

218
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:20,660
It stirs such heavy emotions in me.

219
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,122
So I'm returning it to you.

220
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:29,836
My life has been turned upside down

221
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:32,589
ever since I met you.

222
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:35,842
It feels as if

223
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:39,262
a sudden gust of wind ruined everything

224
00:19:39,554 --> 00:19:41,264
when I didn't even do anything.

225
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:45,476
I can't stop thinking
about the way you looked at me

226
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:49,981
and how you embraced me when we first met,

227
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:54,110
and it's driving me crazy.

228
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:58,448
Why can't it be me?

229
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:01,284
I'm Hae-sun.

230
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:06,122
Why are you drawn to someone else

231
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:08,583
when you've been waiting for me for ages?

232
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:11,753
I'm sorry.

233
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:16,674
I never meant to make you feel this way.

234
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:22,764
What do I have to do?

235
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:26,059
What can I do

236
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:28,519
to make you look at me again?

237
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:30,563
Tell me.

238
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:32,774
What was Hae-sun like?

239
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:35,818
What can I do to win your heart back?

240
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:41,824
Don't try to become her.

241
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:45,536
You did nothing wrong.

242
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:47,664
I tried to...

243
00:20:49,624 --> 00:20:51,000
I tried to find her

244
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:53,503
in you.

245
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:58,091
Blame me.

246
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,593
This is all

247
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:02,470
my fault.

248
00:21:11,229 --> 00:21:12,397
You were the first.

249
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,028
You were the first one
to look at me that way.

250
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:21,906
You were the first one

251
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:25,076
to make me feel loved.

252
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,705
That's why I don't want to let you go.

253
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:33,001
I want you to keep looking at me that way.

254
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:40,216
I hope

255
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:43,928
you will someday be loved that way.

256
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:47,223
That's all I can say.

257
00:21:49,434 --> 00:21:50,518
Goodbye.

258
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:08,953
You're being deceived by him.

259
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,997
He doesn't love you.

260
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,041
He's using you to become human.

261
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:15,168
He has to suck you dry of your blood
to become human.

262
00:22:16,586 --> 00:22:19,005
No, that can't be it.

263
00:22:19,422 --> 00:22:20,590
- My blood?
- I'm not saying

264
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:22,008
I'm going to take your life.

265
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:25,219
I only wish for your poisonous blood

266
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:29,265
to be warmed up and filled with love.

267
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:33,019
And I ask that you share
your warmth with me

268
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:37,356
since I was one day short
of becoming human.

269
00:22:44,489 --> 00:22:46,074
He needs my blood

270
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:49,702
to become human and to experience love
that makes his heart beat.

271
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:51,621
I have to help him.

272
00:22:52,497 --> 00:22:54,916
I'll make sure he fulfills his wish.

273
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:17,188
If I leave,

274
00:23:18,523 --> 00:23:20,274
she will be left alone again.

275
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:36,958
I must leave

276
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:39,627
for her sake.

277
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:45,133
I want you

278
00:23:46,217 --> 00:23:49,095
to stay by my side for a long time.

279
00:23:51,389 --> 00:23:54,350
So that I don't become a monster.

280
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,707
Let's stay like this for a second.

281
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:22,336
Let's not think about anything else

282
00:24:24,172 --> 00:24:25,339
and just stay like this.

283
00:24:28,301 --> 00:24:29,510
You could have tripped.

284
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:32,013
Are you feeling okay?

285
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:35,641
How could you not call me once
when you were this worried?

286
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:37,518
You didn't even visit.

287
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:40,730
I told you

288
00:24:41,606 --> 00:24:43,399
to stay by my side.

289
00:25:13,638 --> 00:25:15,264
Why are you two coming home together?

290
00:25:15,348 --> 00:25:17,725
Shouldn't you stay in the hospital?
Are you okay? Were you startled?

291
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:20,228
Did you guys fight so badly
that she had to be hospitalized?

292
00:25:20,311 --> 00:25:21,520
Are you okay? Were you startled?

293
00:25:21,938 --> 00:25:23,731
I came home quickly

294
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:25,358
so you guys don't slack off.

295
00:25:27,318 --> 00:25:29,695
You should learn to trust your employees.

296
00:25:30,071 --> 00:25:31,614
Did you clean the bathroom?

297
00:25:31,906 --> 00:25:33,324
Did you water the plants?

298
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:37,245
You came in
when we were just about to do them.

299
00:25:40,498 --> 00:25:43,292
Don't worry about work today
and just rest.

300
00:25:43,376 --> 00:25:44,627
Come on, let's go.

301
00:25:48,381 --> 00:25:49,674
Rest up.

302
00:25:49,757 --> 00:25:50,841
Have you eaten yet?

303
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:53,094
Stop it.

304
00:25:56,847 --> 00:25:57,682
Guys,

305
00:25:58,057 --> 00:25:59,892
I'd like a word with you later.

306
00:26:07,608 --> 00:26:08,651
Ms. Joo.

307
00:26:19,704 --> 00:26:20,705
I'm sorry.

308
00:26:21,205 --> 00:26:23,165
You got hurt because of me.

309
00:26:23,374 --> 00:26:24,959
Why would you be sorry?

310
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:27,086
That man was the one who caused trouble.

311
00:26:27,378 --> 00:26:28,504
Don't say that.

312
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,470
Are you doing okay?

313
00:26:38,848 --> 00:26:40,558
I've been feeling anxious to go outside

314
00:26:42,226 --> 00:26:45,730
since being questioned
at the police station.

315
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:48,858
I should've visited you at the hospital.

316
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:52,653
I really didn't expect him
to follow me here.

317
00:26:53,154 --> 00:26:56,032
I ran away from my house at night
and even changed my number.

318
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,659
I thought it was all over.

319
00:26:58,743 --> 00:26:59,744
But he shows up again.

320
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,172
You must've been really scared.

321
00:27:17,887 --> 00:27:20,056
But it's a relief
things didn't get too serious.

322
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:22,224
Thank you.

323
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:25,019
You must've been scared too.

324
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:28,773
You even hurt yourself
while trying to help me.

325
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,692
Gosh, I'm so sorry.

326
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:33,611
I'm really okay.

327
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,739
I know it's easier said than done.

328
00:27:37,198 --> 00:27:39,909
Most people turn a blind eye
when they see violence on the street

329
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:41,369
and just pass by.

330
00:27:42,495 --> 00:27:44,080
But you stepped in

331
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:46,999
and made me feel I wasn't alone.

332
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:48,709
Thank you so much.

333
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:52,129
I was so scared.

334
00:27:56,967 --> 00:27:58,552
You're not alone, So-i.

335
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:02,431
You have us.

336
00:28:05,935 --> 00:28:07,144
So don't be scared.

337
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:09,522
And don't cry because of that jerk.

338
00:28:11,357 --> 00:28:12,775
I'll be by your side.

339
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:22,827
Attorney Park,

340
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:23,911
I need to see you.

341
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,213
I will return everything
to its rightful place.

342
00:28:37,967 --> 00:28:39,760
You want to find Butler Joo's father?

343
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:41,679
Yes.

344
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:44,390
We want to find him as much as you do.

345
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:47,643
He probably knows
the whereabouts of the gold bars.

346
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,019
But let's face it.

347
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:52,982
He went missing five years ago
and was declared legally dead.

348
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:55,151
How on earth can we find him?

349
00:28:56,986 --> 00:28:58,612
We have to do something.

350
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:00,656
A person went missing,

351
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,616
and he might've been kidnapped
as you said,

352
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,993
so we can't just sit on our hands.

353
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:08,747
Why don't we look for more witnesses?

354
00:29:09,123 --> 00:29:09,999
By the way,

355
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:13,002
why do you want to find him
all of a sudden?

356
00:29:14,295 --> 00:29:15,379
Well...

357
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:19,633
Just because.

358
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:23,095
She shouldn't be alone and lonely.

359
00:29:24,013 --> 00:29:25,139
Woo-hyeol,

360
00:29:25,222 --> 00:29:27,349
she won't be since you'll be with her.

361
00:29:27,975 --> 00:29:30,519
Anyway, shouldn't you start getting ready?

362
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:31,770
For what?

363
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:33,355
Come on.

364
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,524
You know what I mean.

365
00:29:35,816 --> 00:29:38,152
Her blood is full of love now.

366
00:29:38,235 --> 00:29:40,154
You should get ready to become human.

367
00:29:41,655 --> 00:29:45,993
Your condition is getting worse,
so I think you should hurry.

368
00:29:46,452 --> 00:29:47,495
So?

369
00:29:47,578 --> 00:29:49,413
Did you talk to her about it?

370
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:54,835
As I said,

371
00:29:55,419 --> 00:29:58,672
I want to find her father first.

372
00:30:01,634 --> 00:30:02,676
Right!

373
00:30:03,219 --> 00:30:05,721
Now I understand
why you want to find her father.

374
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:06,931
Give and take.

375
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:10,017
You're going to find her father
in return for her blood full of love.

376
00:30:11,644 --> 00:30:12,603
I get it.

377
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:21,028
BUTLER JOO

378
00:30:21,111 --> 00:30:22,530
Meet me in the backyard.

379
00:30:50,391 --> 00:30:52,101
Why are you so down?

380
00:30:55,062 --> 00:30:56,063
No.

381
00:30:57,273 --> 00:30:58,315
I'm not down.

382
00:30:59,984 --> 00:31:01,902
I think you are.

383
00:31:02,278 --> 00:31:04,238
What is it? Tell me.

384
00:31:08,409 --> 00:31:09,660
I feel bad...

385
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:12,997
seeing you.

386
00:31:15,249 --> 00:31:17,418
You were lying there bleeding.

387
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:21,005
I hated myself

388
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,091
for reacting to your blood.

389
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:29,179
I haven't changed at all.

390
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:31,181
I can't forgive myself...

391
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:37,813
for letting my instincts
get the best of me.

392
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:46,697
I'm not sure

393
00:31:47,448 --> 00:31:49,366
if I deserve to dream of love.

394
00:31:51,285 --> 00:31:52,828
Do I really

395
00:31:53,454 --> 00:31:55,873
deserve to become human
and experience love

396
00:31:57,666 --> 00:31:58,792
that makes my heart beat?

397
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:07,259
If I were Hae-sun, I would've told you

398
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:09,678
not to feel bad.

399
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:14,933
I would've been relieved to know
that you would remember me

400
00:32:15,017 --> 00:32:16,477
by drinking my blood.

401
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:20,439
I would've been glad that I could help you

402
00:32:21,398 --> 00:32:22,524
with my blood.

403
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:25,194
That's how Hae-sun would've felt.

404
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:41,043
So don't doubt yourself.

405
00:32:42,211 --> 00:32:44,713
You deserve to be in love.

406
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:01,313
Is Ms. Joo okay?

407
00:33:07,403 --> 00:33:08,320
That little...

408
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,080
I like being with Woo-hyeol.

409
00:33:18,789 --> 00:33:21,166
He's not the one who needs me.

410
00:33:21,542 --> 00:33:23,168
I need him.

411
00:33:33,554 --> 00:33:35,889
What are you doing in my office?

412
00:33:42,062 --> 00:33:44,148
What's yours is mine.

413
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:46,191
We're in the same boat.

414
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:58,495
So...

415
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:00,789
did you find my information useful?

416
00:34:05,002 --> 00:34:06,336
I'll pay you as promised.

417
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,422
She must mean a lot to you,

418
00:34:09,089 --> 00:34:10,340
seeing how you rushed out.

419
00:34:11,258 --> 00:34:12,760
Right, sorry.

420
00:34:13,844 --> 00:34:15,471
I keep crossing the line.

421
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:20,350
Let's see.

422
00:34:20,684 --> 00:34:23,312
What's our next step?

423
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:25,105
I need a half-vampire's blood.

424
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:27,274
Blood?

425
00:34:28,317 --> 00:34:31,487
I want to know
how to capture a half-vampire.

426
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,949
There's a scar on Seon Woo-hyeol's neck.

427
00:34:38,285 --> 00:34:40,829
I knew it.

428
00:34:42,164 --> 00:34:45,417
Serves him right
for recklessly trying to become human.

429
00:34:50,506 --> 00:34:52,508
I'll pay you more money.

430
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:55,010
Capture him alive for me.

431
00:34:57,763 --> 00:34:58,972
This is interesting.

432
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:03,060
There were people like you in the past.

433
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:07,231
They were in search of beings
who stood between humans and vampires.

434
00:35:08,649 --> 00:35:11,443
I didn't know such people still existed.

435
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:12,903
How fascinating.

436
00:35:18,242 --> 00:35:19,243
Make it fast.

437
00:35:19,827 --> 00:35:21,411
We have to take action

438
00:35:21,495 --> 00:35:23,497
before Seon Woo-hyeol attacks In-hae.

439
00:35:24,957 --> 00:35:25,833
All right.

440
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:29,002
Just be ready to pay a generous fee
for my services.

441
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:36,134
Woo-hyeol, the fliers are ready.

442
00:35:37,219 --> 00:35:38,053
Right.

443
00:35:39,221 --> 00:35:40,138
Take a look.

444
00:35:40,222 --> 00:35:41,974
All right, thanks.

445
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:45,352
LOOKING FOR WITNESSES

446
00:35:45,853 --> 00:35:47,437
Do you think this will work?

447
00:35:47,521 --> 00:35:48,772
It's been too long.

448
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:51,400
We should at least try.

449
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:54,736
It seems like he was last seen
here in Gongcheon-dong.

450
00:35:55,028 --> 00:35:56,154
So let's start here.

451
00:35:56,238 --> 00:35:58,740
He has to be alive
if we were to find the gold bars.

452
00:35:59,575 --> 00:36:01,702
Human lives
are much more valuable than gold.

453
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:05,038
Didn't I tell you to think
for three seconds before you talk?

454
00:36:05,956 --> 00:36:08,667
Well, I'm just saying.

455
00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:13,005
You stay home while I distribute
the fliers with Sang-hae.

456
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:17,217
After the recent incident,

457
00:36:17,718 --> 00:36:19,344
I don't want to leave Butler Joo alone.

458
00:36:19,428 --> 00:36:21,054
Sure thing.

459
00:36:21,138 --> 00:36:22,097
Thank you.

460
00:36:22,556 --> 00:36:23,557
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

461
00:36:25,893 --> 00:36:27,311
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

462
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:31,315
- Welcome.
- Please read this.

463
00:36:31,398 --> 00:36:32,608
LOOKING FOR WITNESSES

464
00:36:38,447 --> 00:36:40,365
Could you please take a look at this?

465
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:42,993
What's this?

466
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:50,125
- I haven't seen him.
- Who is this?

467
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:53,086
- He went missing?
- I'm sorry, we haven't seen him.

468
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:00,469
Hey.

469
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:13,482
Gosh, it's hot.

470
00:37:14,191 --> 00:37:16,193
- It's Uncle Woo-hyeol.
- Where?

471
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:18,028
Uncle Woo-hyeol!

472
00:37:18,111 --> 00:37:19,988
Hey, Min-jae!

473
00:37:20,781 --> 00:37:22,324
Goodness, hey.

474
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:24,034
How have you been?

475
00:37:24,618 --> 00:37:26,954
- Hello.
- Hello.

476
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:29,539
I heard you took him to the amusement park

477
00:37:29,623 --> 00:37:31,249
on the day I asked you to babysit him.

478
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:33,752
He loved it.

479
00:37:33,961 --> 00:37:36,338
I never got to thank you for that day.

480
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:38,840
- Did you have fun?
- Yes.

481
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:41,301
I had a good time thanks to him.

482
00:37:42,636 --> 00:37:45,222
Come by my shop sometime,

483
00:37:45,305 --> 00:37:47,099
and I'll make you a suit at half price.

484
00:37:48,642 --> 00:37:49,685
Thank you.

485
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:51,979
I also want a suit.

486
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:55,399
What's that? "Looking for witnesses"?

487
00:37:55,482 --> 00:37:58,026
- Oh, here you go.
- What is that?

488
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:02,280
Are you looking for the missing person
you mentioned last time?

489
00:38:02,364 --> 00:38:03,490
Yes.

490
00:38:03,907 --> 00:38:05,033
But...

491
00:38:06,368 --> 00:38:08,745
I know it's been a while,

492
00:38:08,829 --> 00:38:10,497
but I had to do something.

493
00:38:10,706 --> 00:38:13,375
A picture would have helped.

494
00:38:13,834 --> 00:38:16,003
Would this be enough information?

495
00:38:16,086 --> 00:38:18,088
Well, who knows?

496
00:38:18,422 --> 00:38:22,134
If you ask long-time neighbors like you,
they might know something.

497
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:24,845
- Think about the house prices.
- Jeez.

498
00:38:25,846 --> 00:38:28,515
Please ask around

499
00:38:28,598 --> 00:38:30,517
and let us know if you recall something.

500
00:38:31,268 --> 00:38:32,102
Ask around?

501
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:36,189
Please ask the members
of the neighborhood patrol too.

502
00:38:36,732 --> 00:38:38,817
You can hand these out next Monday.

503
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,736
Yes, that's a good idea.

504
00:38:41,153 --> 00:38:43,363
I will, but could you hand them out first?

505
00:38:43,447 --> 00:38:45,699
We're in a rush here.

506
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:48,493
Give us a call.

507
00:38:48,577 --> 00:38:49,786
- I'll give you a few more.
- It's okay.

508
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:52,205
- Maybe you can put it up at your shop.
- I don't think so.

509
00:39:00,422 --> 00:39:01,465
Welcome...

510
00:39:09,473 --> 00:39:12,559
I told you I'd follow my heart as well,
didn't I?

511
00:39:21,318 --> 00:39:22,944
INVESTMENT WITHDRAWAL REQUEST

512
00:39:27,032 --> 00:39:29,618
Technically speaking,
this is a breach of contract.

513
00:39:30,118 --> 00:39:33,371
You deceived me while knowing
the real identity of Seon Woo-hyeol.

514
00:39:33,622 --> 00:39:37,042
But you also know he's not dangerous.

515
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:39,336
How can you be so sure?

516
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:41,797
That's not how you do business.

517
00:39:42,172 --> 00:39:44,800
A vampire at a guest house for humans?

518
00:39:45,759 --> 00:39:48,804
Will you take responsibility
if someone finds out?

519
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:54,518
- That's--
- If I had known, I wouldn't have invested.

520
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:56,436
Mr. Shin and I are both victims.

521
00:39:56,895 --> 00:39:59,147
You tricked me out of money,

522
00:39:59,773 --> 00:40:00,941
so you'll pay for it.

523
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:03,652
Pay back the investment
and the penalty for breach of contract

524
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:04,569
before I take things further.

525
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:08,198
How am I supposed
to pay you back right now?

526
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:10,534
The guest house only just opened.

527
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:13,453
Or you can give me this mansion.

528
00:40:14,871 --> 00:40:15,872
What did you say?

529
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:21,962
If you leave this mansion,
I'll let things slide.

530
00:40:22,546 --> 00:40:23,839
No strings attached.

531
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:26,466
Think carefully about what's best

532
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:27,968
for Seon Woo-hyeol.

533
00:40:30,846 --> 00:40:32,472
This isn't what's best for him.

534
00:40:33,223 --> 00:40:35,016
It's to satisfy your own greed.

535
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:39,229
What?

536
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:43,483
I'll return your investment
one way or another.

537
00:40:43,817 --> 00:40:45,986
But I'm never going to give up this house.

538
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:49,447
It means a lot to Woo-hyeol.

539
00:40:53,869 --> 00:40:55,495
I'll do everything it takes to protect it

540
00:40:55,829 --> 00:40:57,080
for him.

541
00:41:01,501 --> 00:41:02,919
Be my guest.

542
00:41:04,296 --> 00:41:05,422
You have a week.

543
00:41:14,431 --> 00:41:15,515
Leaving already?

544
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:23,940
What's going on?

545
00:41:24,524 --> 00:41:27,319
Why is everyone so angry? Jeez, how scary.

546
00:41:29,946 --> 00:41:31,489
INVESTMENT WITHDRAWAL REQUEST

547
00:41:32,199 --> 00:41:33,909
Where will I find so much money?

548
00:42:20,205 --> 00:42:21,206
It seems like

549
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:23,833
things will work out smoothly.

550
00:42:32,425 --> 00:42:33,718
You're back.

551
00:42:34,511 --> 00:42:35,470
Hey.

552
00:42:41,851 --> 00:42:43,520
How did it go with the fliers?

553
00:42:44,521 --> 00:42:45,480
It went all right.

554
00:42:46,439 --> 00:42:49,276
We received three tips just today,

555
00:42:49,526 --> 00:42:52,320
although they all turned out
to be useless.

556
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:56,491
Right, Ms. Na was just here.

557
00:42:58,326 --> 00:42:59,160
She was?

558
00:42:59,244 --> 00:43:01,037
Yes, but things seemed quite tense

559
00:43:01,371 --> 00:43:04,833
between Butler Joo and her.

560
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:19,180
If you leave this mansion,
I'll let things slide.

561
00:43:19,472 --> 00:43:21,433
Think carefully about what's best

562
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:22,809
for Seon Woo-hyeol.

563
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:30,900
Butler Joo, are you in there?

564
00:43:32,861 --> 00:43:33,945
Give me a second.

565
00:43:37,657 --> 00:43:38,658
Come on in.

566
00:43:45,707 --> 00:43:47,083
I heard Ms. Na came by.

567
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:49,294
Oh, yes.

568
00:43:51,296 --> 00:43:52,255
What was it about?

569
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:55,383
She was in the area, so she dropped by.

570
00:43:58,094 --> 00:44:01,097
- I see.
- It's nothing, so don't worry.

571
00:44:05,268 --> 00:44:07,228
Where were you?

572
00:44:07,437 --> 00:44:08,897
I haven't seen you all day.

573
00:44:11,775 --> 00:44:12,776
Right.

574
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:17,280
Sang-hae wanted me to help him
find someone.

575
00:44:17,614 --> 00:44:19,240
I see.

576
00:44:23,286 --> 00:44:24,371
By the way,

577
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:27,082
if...

578
00:44:27,749 --> 00:44:29,751
your father comes back alive,

579
00:44:30,627 --> 00:44:32,045
how do you think you'll feel?

580
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:35,965
What do you mean all of a sudden?

581
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:40,845
How would you feel

582
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:45,809
if he's been alive this whole time
and comes back?

583
00:44:54,567 --> 00:44:55,819
It's already too late.

584
00:44:56,903 --> 00:44:59,531
I don't need him anymore.

585
00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:05,453
I'm fine.

586
00:45:06,621 --> 00:45:09,374
I have you, and that's enough.

587
00:45:24,013 --> 00:45:25,098
You know what?

588
00:45:26,141 --> 00:45:28,268
I'm getting tired of ox blood.

589
00:45:30,854 --> 00:45:33,398
A pack of blood would hit the spot.

590
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:34,482
At least we have this.

591
00:45:34,941 --> 00:45:35,942
You should be grateful.

592
00:45:37,527 --> 00:45:38,987
By the way,

593
00:45:40,405 --> 00:45:41,990
I hope Butler Joo won't kick us out

594
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:44,117
when Woo-hyeol becomes human.

595
00:45:44,325 --> 00:45:46,995
Even if she does,

596
00:45:48,413 --> 00:45:50,165
Woo-hyeol will protect us.

597
00:45:50,915 --> 00:45:52,709
You guys have to protect him.

598
00:45:52,792 --> 00:45:55,253
You startled me! I spilled everything.

599
00:45:55,962 --> 00:45:58,798
Can you stop sneaking up like that?

600
00:45:59,215 --> 00:46:02,010
It's been a while, Mr. Ko.
How have you been?

601
00:46:04,012 --> 00:46:05,638
Can't you see for yourself?

602
00:46:07,098 --> 00:46:08,516
I haven't been well.

603
00:46:10,393 --> 00:46:13,480
I'm gravely concerned
about Seon Woo-hyeol.

604
00:46:14,481 --> 00:46:15,773
Why?

605
00:46:18,443 --> 00:46:20,778
When that moon fades,

606
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:22,614
darkness will fall.

607
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,578
What are we to do?

608
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,249
Why state the obvious?

609
00:46:33,333 --> 00:46:35,627
Woo-hyeol is getting ready
to leave you guys.

610
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:56,523
- Woo-hyeol.
- Woo-hyeol.

611
00:47:02,987 --> 00:47:03,988
Woo-hyeol.

612
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,158
How could you do this to us?

613
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:08,952
What are you talking about?

614
00:47:09,035 --> 00:47:10,954
Mr. Ko just told us everything.

615
00:47:11,412 --> 00:47:14,457
Why didn't you tell us?
What were you thinking?

616
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:17,293
Telling you guys won't change anything.

617
00:47:18,753 --> 00:47:20,213
I didn't want to make you worry.

618
00:47:21,422 --> 00:47:23,925
What are you talking about?

619
00:47:24,592 --> 00:47:27,595
You're going to die, Woo-hyeol!

620
00:47:30,515 --> 00:47:31,683
I'm okay.

621
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:35,895
I have no regrets.

622
00:47:37,313 --> 00:47:38,690
I've lived a long life

623
00:47:39,983 --> 00:47:42,694
and I've been lucky enough to have
great brothers like you two.

624
00:47:43,653 --> 00:47:45,446
Although I failed to become human,

625
00:47:46,281 --> 00:47:48,157
I met someone special

626
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:50,159
who taught me what love is.

627
00:47:50,994 --> 00:47:52,412
I couldn't ask for more.

628
00:47:53,121 --> 00:47:54,497
What are we to you?

629
00:47:55,415 --> 00:47:57,041
Do you not care about us at all?

630
00:47:57,959 --> 00:47:59,294
You did this 100 years ago too.

631
00:47:59,794 --> 00:48:02,547
"I can become human if I spend
100 years in a hawthorn coffin."

632
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:03,631
"Goodbye."

633
00:48:03,965 --> 00:48:05,049
You went into your slumber

634
00:48:05,717 --> 00:48:08,636
without saying anything to us first.

635
00:48:09,137 --> 00:48:11,889
And this time, you decided to die

636
00:48:13,474 --> 00:48:14,851
without saying anything to us.

637
00:48:16,561 --> 00:48:18,062
This isn't right, Woo-hyeol.

638
00:48:20,565 --> 00:48:21,482
Dong-seop.

639
00:48:24,861 --> 00:48:25,862
Woo-hyeol.

640
00:48:25,945 --> 00:48:28,698
As we told you last time,
I mean, 100 years ago,

641
00:48:28,781 --> 00:48:30,658
we can't live without you.

642
00:48:31,993 --> 00:48:34,078
We need you.

643
00:48:38,333 --> 00:48:39,250
Sang-hae.

644
00:48:55,183 --> 00:48:58,311
SHADED OASIS GUEST HOUSE

645
00:49:02,607 --> 00:49:04,317
I'm stepping out for a bit.

646
00:49:06,027 --> 00:49:07,070
All right.

647
00:49:12,325 --> 00:49:13,159
Hey.

648
00:49:26,005 --> 00:49:27,006
Hey.

649
00:49:43,314 --> 00:49:47,110
Customer number five,
please come to window number three.

650
00:49:47,568 --> 00:49:50,029
Hello, ma'am. How can I help you?

651
00:49:50,113 --> 00:49:52,365
I'd like to look into
small business loans.

652
00:49:52,448 --> 00:49:53,950
Did you bring your ID?

653
00:49:54,033 --> 00:49:54,951
Yes.

654
00:49:58,871 --> 00:50:01,457
We won't know for sure
until the screening process is over,

655
00:50:01,541 --> 00:50:03,209
but because of your previous house loan,

656
00:50:03,418 --> 00:50:05,169
you won't be able to take out a lot.

657
00:50:06,212 --> 00:50:08,172
I will contact you after the screening.

658
00:50:09,882 --> 00:50:11,884
Where will I find so much money?

659
00:50:16,055 --> 00:50:18,349
DAEBAK BUTCHER SHOP

660
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:20,852
Is something up at your house?

661
00:50:22,228 --> 00:50:24,188
- Sorry?
- Mr. Ox Blood

662
00:50:24,272 --> 00:50:27,650
was distributing fliers
to look for a missing person.

663
00:50:29,569 --> 00:50:30,611
You didn't know?

664
00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:55,052
Hello?

665
00:50:55,344 --> 00:50:56,304
Hello.

666
00:50:57,346 --> 00:51:00,516
I'm calling you
after seeing the missing person flier.

667
00:51:02,143 --> 00:51:04,353
I think I've seen him.

668
00:51:04,687 --> 00:51:05,938
I know where he is.

669
00:51:07,899 --> 00:51:08,983
Where is he?

670
00:51:11,652 --> 00:51:12,695
Okay.

671
00:51:21,662 --> 00:51:22,830
Please spare my life.

672
00:51:33,341 --> 00:51:34,383
You're back.

673
00:51:34,801 --> 00:51:35,802
Where's Woo-hyeol?

674
00:51:35,885 --> 00:51:37,011
He went out a while ago.

675
00:51:37,345 --> 00:51:38,638
You don't know where he went?

676
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:40,973
If you're curious, call him.

677
00:51:43,392 --> 00:51:46,437
Did you know
he's been distributing these fliers?

678
00:51:46,729 --> 00:51:48,064
LOOKING FOR WITNESSES

679
00:51:53,903 --> 00:51:57,031
Why is he slacking off when he should
be busy with the guest house?

680
00:51:57,406 --> 00:51:58,324
Hold on.

681
00:52:00,284 --> 00:52:02,036
That's a little rude of you.

682
00:52:02,370 --> 00:52:05,998
It's your father he's looking for,
so how can you say he's slacking off?

683
00:52:06,082 --> 00:52:07,708
I never asked him to.

684
00:52:07,792 --> 00:52:10,253
Do you think he's doing this
because he has nothing better to do?

685
00:52:10,336 --> 00:52:11,337
When he's gone...

686
00:52:16,259 --> 00:52:17,343
Forget it.

687
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:20,888
Talk to Woo-hyeol if you have a problem.

688
00:52:40,116 --> 00:52:43,119
SEON WOO-HYEOL

689
00:52:47,874 --> 00:52:49,667
Your call cannot be completed
at this time.

690
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:51,586
You will be redirected to voicemail.

691
00:52:58,009 --> 00:53:00,261
There's so much to worry about as is.

692
00:53:01,971 --> 00:53:04,265
What on earth is he up to?

693
00:53:12,648 --> 00:53:14,275
LOOKING FOR WITNESSES

694
00:54:00,154 --> 00:54:01,280
I smell blood.

695
00:55:01,048 --> 00:55:02,675
How could someone do this to humans?

696
00:55:25,031 --> 00:55:25,990
Lee Man-hwi.

697
00:55:31,412 --> 00:55:32,371
How do you like it?

698
00:55:33,122 --> 00:55:34,707
The smell of fresh human blood.

699
00:55:35,791 --> 00:55:36,792
You...

700
00:55:37,043 --> 00:55:39,086
still suck human blood?

701
00:55:41,005 --> 00:55:42,381
I didn't kill them.

702
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:45,885
I just had a little taste.

703
00:55:47,762 --> 00:55:48,888
You must be hungry.

704
00:55:49,555 --> 00:55:50,639
Help yourself over there.

705
00:55:55,436 --> 00:55:57,229
How could you lock up live humans

706
00:55:57,313 --> 00:55:59,523
and suck their blood?

707
00:55:59,607 --> 00:56:02,026
They're all good-for-nothings anyway.

708
00:56:02,318 --> 00:56:04,361
Alcoholics, homeless people,

709
00:56:04,445 --> 00:56:06,405
and runaway criminals.

710
00:56:07,239 --> 00:56:09,325
I carefully chose
those who no one would miss

711
00:56:09,408 --> 00:56:10,785
even if they disappeared.

712
00:56:11,911 --> 00:56:15,372
If anything, I should be credited
for collecting trash.

713
00:56:15,456 --> 00:56:17,124
Have you lost your mind?!

714
00:56:17,333 --> 00:56:18,542
You're the one

715
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:21,087
who's lost your mind, Seon Woo-hyeol.

716
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:29,136
You ended up a half-vampire
while trying to become human.

717
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:32,223
Anyway,

718
00:56:32,765 --> 00:56:34,141
it all worked out well

719
00:56:34,225 --> 00:56:36,727
since I'll be making a fortune
thanks to you.

720
00:56:38,229 --> 00:56:39,480
What do you mean?

721
00:56:39,688 --> 00:56:42,274
There's someone
looking for a half-vampire's blood,

722
00:56:42,358 --> 00:56:43,400
so I'm handing you over.

723
00:56:43,943 --> 00:56:45,027
What?

724
00:56:45,694 --> 00:56:48,114
It's not easy to find a partner
who's both rich and agreeable.

725
00:56:48,531 --> 00:56:49,698
But I guess I was lucky.

726
00:56:58,833 --> 00:57:00,209
LEE MAN-HWI

727
00:57:05,131 --> 00:57:05,965
Hello.

728
00:57:06,048 --> 00:57:07,800
I have Seon Woo-hyeol.

729
00:57:09,218 --> 00:57:10,219
Really?

730
00:57:10,302 --> 00:57:12,054
If you don't believe me,
come see for yourself.

731
00:57:12,138 --> 00:57:13,055
Lee Man-hwi!

732
00:57:15,516 --> 00:57:16,433
I'll be right there.

733
00:57:17,184 --> 00:57:18,102
Where are you?

734
00:57:19,854 --> 00:57:21,814
I'll text you the address.

735
00:57:23,399 --> 00:57:25,109
You don't want to miss a show like this.

736
00:57:36,996 --> 00:57:38,706
It seems like you've finally become human

737
00:57:39,331 --> 00:57:41,000
after wanting to become one so badly.

738
00:57:42,918 --> 00:57:44,128
The mighty Seon Woo-hyeol

739
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:46,338
can't even escape this?

740
00:58:08,277 --> 00:58:09,403
Seon Woo-hyeol.

741
00:58:10,237 --> 00:58:11,739
Are you really going to die?

742
00:58:12,865 --> 00:58:13,908
Really?

743
00:58:16,285 --> 00:58:17,119
Seriously?

744
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:25,127
I'll gladly die when my time comes,

745
00:58:25,586 --> 00:58:26,670
but I'll never let you

746
00:58:28,088 --> 00:58:29,173
have your way.

747
00:58:31,258 --> 00:58:32,301
Too bad.

748
00:58:33,427 --> 00:58:35,137
I'm not ready to die just yet.

749
00:58:35,554 --> 00:58:36,972
I was so happy

750
00:58:37,306 --> 00:58:39,016
during the 100 years you were gone.

751
00:58:39,683 --> 00:58:41,268
So I intend to live happily ever after

752
00:58:41,352 --> 00:58:43,562
in a world without you.

753
00:58:50,361 --> 00:58:52,071
I hope we never meet again.

754
00:58:53,072 --> 00:58:54,114
I hate

755
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:55,991
seeing you.

756
00:58:59,703 --> 00:59:02,081
LOOKING FOR WITNESSES

757
00:59:06,794 --> 00:59:10,047
If your father comes back alive,

758
00:59:11,090 --> 00:59:12,508
how do you think you'll feel?

759
00:59:16,011 --> 00:59:18,305
I was wondering
why he asked me such a question.

760
00:59:20,307 --> 00:59:22,893
He was going to find my dad.

761
01:00:19,783 --> 01:00:22,786
HEARTBEAT

762
01:00:23,162 --> 01:00:24,163
Just you wait.

763
01:00:24,246 --> 01:00:26,665
I will capture Seon Woo-hyeol
with my own hands no matter what.

764
01:00:26,749 --> 01:00:29,793
If you tell me how I can get
the blood of a half-vampire...

765
01:00:29,877 --> 01:00:32,546
It's a knife made of hawthorn wood
and silver as you requested.

766
01:00:32,755 --> 01:00:34,173
Happy Blood Day.

767
01:00:34,423 --> 01:00:36,258
Why don't we move things up?

768
01:00:36,592 --> 01:00:38,969
She must leave
for us to have a happy ending.

769
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:41,680
What happened to your arm?

770
01:00:41,764 --> 01:00:43,098
Woo-hyeol!

771
01:00:43,182 --> 01:00:45,601
Woo-hyeol might die?

772
01:00:45,684 --> 01:00:48,437
He couldn't suck Butler Joo dry
of her blood to become human.

773
01:00:48,771 --> 01:00:49,855
Woohyeol is gone.

774
01:00:50,439 --> 01:00:51,774
He went to die.

775
01:00:52,066 --> 01:00:53,734
How can you leave like this?

776
01:00:57,780 --> 01:00:59,782
