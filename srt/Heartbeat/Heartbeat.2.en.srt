HEARTBEAT

00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,298
ALL CHARACTERS, NAMES,
ORGANIZATIONS, GROUPS, EVENTS,

3
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,383
AND SETTINGS ARE FICTITIOUS
AND ANIMAL SAFETY GUIDELINES WERE FOLLOWED

4
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:52,261
- What's the date today?
- What?

5
00:00:52,762 --> 00:00:55,848
Isn't today December 9th, Year 4355,
of the Dangun calendar?

6
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:57,725
It's not the ninth, but the eighth!

7
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:01,687
The eighth?

8
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:08,694
The eighth?

9
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:11,572
It hasn't been 100 years then.

10
00:01:13,324 --> 00:01:14,575
I'm one day short.

11
00:01:16,786 --> 00:01:19,538
I woke up a day early.

12
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:32,718
Hello? Is this the police?

13
00:01:32,802 --> 00:01:35,346
I'd like to report a break-in
in Gongcheon-dong.

14
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:36,555
A pervert...

15
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:39,517
Seriously?

16
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,976
What do you think you're doing?

17
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:43,312
What's your deal?

18
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:45,689
Why did you wake me up?!

19
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:52,446
Why are you yelling at me?

20
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,864
You...

21
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:56,075
broke the promise.

22
00:01:56,158 --> 00:01:57,159
What promise?

23
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,080
Do you know...

24
00:02:02,498 --> 00:02:03,666
how much I suffered...

25
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:06,043
in that coffin?

26
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:09,880
You ruined everything.

27
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:13,968
It's all your fault.

28
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:18,055
You will be punished

29
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:21,016
for waking me up.

30
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:55,009
Hey.

31
00:02:56,302 --> 00:02:57,386
Are you okay?

32
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:09,273
Hey.

33
00:03:13,986 --> 00:03:15,029
Hey!

34
00:03:26,165 --> 00:03:27,291
What...

EPISODE 2

36
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:43,891
...three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

37
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:46,143
Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

38
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,312
Two, three, four, five, six, seven,

39
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:51,148
- eight, nine, ten, eleven.
- Oh, no.

40
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,984
- One, two, three, four...
- I wish he would stop.

41
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:57,029
- One, two, three, four...
- It hurts this time around.

42
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:59,073
- five, six...
- Please stop.

43
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:03,035
Two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten.

44
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:22,179
Time of death, 20:48.

45
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:30,479
Dead?

46
00:04:36,527 --> 00:04:37,987
- This can't be.
- Are you all right?

47
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,030
- Could you please come this way?
- No...

48
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:41,949
No way.

49
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,576
What... How...

50
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,537
How do you know the patient?

51
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,663
He got hit.

52
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:49,540
- By a brick?
- Yes.

53
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:50,624
- Please have a seat.
- Here.

54
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:57,131
Where am I?

55
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:04,263
This smell.

56
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:07,433
Hand me the glove.

57
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:08,767
All right.

58
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:26,118
Nurse Kim, let's stop the bleeding.

59
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:28,954
Hold on.

60
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,831
Right.

61
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:32,124
I failed to become human.

62
00:05:33,042 --> 00:05:35,335
Darn it!

63
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:02,654
For now, I will return home.

64
00:06:07,326 --> 00:06:10,412
DONGWOO UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

65
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,293
Are you sure you're okay?

66
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,878
Do you not need to take further tests?

67
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,254
I said I was fine.

68
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:20,506
Are you sure?

69
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:22,674
Are you sure you're okay?

70
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:24,802
I said we should head home.

71
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:28,055
Just a second. Let me go pay first.

72
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:31,892
- Hello.
- Hello.

73
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:33,268
- Do you have the number?
- Here.

74
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:35,437
"Self-service kiosk"?

75
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:43,821
The amount you have to pay today
is 310 600 won.

76
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,615
What the...

77
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:48,617
Why is it so expensive?

78
00:06:49,118 --> 00:06:52,121
We failed to identify the patient,

79
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:54,039
so the fee can't be covered by insurance.

80
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:56,500
TOTAL AMOUNT
310 600

81
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,210
Would you like to proceed?

82
00:06:58,794 --> 00:07:01,046
- Oh, sure.
- All right.

83
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:04,299
Will you pay it in full
or in installments?

84
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:05,717
I'll pay in full.

85
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:11,682
Please insert your card.

86
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:14,685
CARD

87
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:29,867
I paid your medical bill,

88
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:33,245
and since you refused additional tests,
I'm not responsible for anything anymore.

89
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:34,746
Don't say otherwise later on.

90
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:37,082
Got it?

91
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:43,672
Fainting after being bitten by a human?
How humiliating.

92
00:07:45,007 --> 00:07:47,176
You should've been
arrested for a break-in,

93
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:49,094
not taken to the hospital.

94
00:07:49,178 --> 00:07:50,262
Lead the way.

95
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,055
Let us head home for now.

96
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:54,975
We shall discuss the matter
of you waking me up.

97
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:57,728
What are you talking about?
We can just go our separate ways.

98
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:02,441
The world changed immensely
during my slumber.

99
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,651
I feel quite lost, so lead the way.

100
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:07,779
Are you still half asleep?

101
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:11,533
Also, why do you keep
speaking casually to me?

102
00:08:11,617 --> 00:08:12,868
I told you.

103
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:16,371
I signed a contract with Butler Joo,
your ancestor, 100 years ago,

104
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:18,498
which was to expire once I turn human.

105
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,628
However, with just one day left...

106
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,630
With just one day left
before I turned human,

107
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:27,299
you woke me up again.

108
00:08:28,217 --> 00:08:29,676
Not this again.

109
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,554
As I said, I know nothing about this.

110
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:34,973
Check with my ancestor
if you don't believe me!

111
00:08:35,057 --> 00:08:36,058
Why you...

112
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:38,060
How dare you glare at me!

113
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:43,106
Fine, I'll rise above it.

114
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,108
You avoid poop because it stinks,
not because it's scary.

115
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:46,235
What? Poop?

116
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:47,819
Hey!

117
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:51,323
Have you ever seen poop this handsome?

118
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:54,243
Handsome or not, poop is poop.

119
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:56,328
Get lost.

120
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:58,747
I said, get lost!

121
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,209
What the...

122
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,588
What a rowdy young lady.

123
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:09,633
Wait.

124
00:09:10,092 --> 00:09:11,510
Sir, please hurry.

125
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:12,594
Hold on a second!

126
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:18,308
What a crazy bastard.

127
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,686
Where are you going? Take me with you!

128
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:23,230
Where to, ma'am?

129
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:47,754
Everything is a mess.

130
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:51,633
Where on earth am I?

131
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:57,139
The world has become
a completely different place.

132
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:20,454
I see a blurry reflection of myself,

133
00:10:22,164 --> 00:10:23,999
but my instinct to suck blood
still remains.

134
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,879
Perhaps I am...

135
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:34,551
somewhere between a human and a vampire.

136
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:54,196
Where are these people going?

137
00:11:09,044 --> 00:11:11,129
A world where there is no distinction
between day and night.

138
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,549
Even at night, it is as bright as day.

139
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:16,093
It's almost blinding.

140
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,281
I see.

141
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:47,290
What the...

142
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:21,825
I am sure there will be a way.

143
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:26,413
For now, I must return to my mansion.

144
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:46,683
It's a mess in here.
We should've come by often.

145
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,351
Gosh.

146
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,061
Should we have gotten a bigger cake?

147
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:51,188
Just choose one already.

148
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:53,773
These are pretty. I love it.

149
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:55,317
Must we go this far though?

150
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:57,652
He's waking up after 100 years.

151
00:12:57,736 --> 00:13:01,364
We should congratulate him
the moment midnight strikes.

152
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:04,367
Says the man who never offered me
a drop of blood on my birthdays.

153
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:06,786
Okay, I hear you.
Anyway, you came prepared.

154
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,080
No way. This is so cool!

155
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:10,624
- It's for me.
- Is it?

156
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,005
Why is it open?

157
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:21,843
What the...

158
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:25,430
This is the mirror I gave him.

159
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,308
Something must've happened.

160
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:31,228
A shattered mirror?

161
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,063
What the hell happened?

162
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:40,779
Maybe he was gravely shocked
after seeing his reflection.

163
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:42,614
- What?
- He found his face

164
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:45,408
far uglier than he had expected.

165
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:47,661
- No way.
- I'm sure of it!

166
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:49,746
He saw his face after turning human

167
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,415
and was shocked by how ugly he is.

168
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:55,669
Then he ran off
screaming at the top of his lungs

169
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:57,712
all the while regretting becoming human.

170
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:02,676
"I want to go back!"

171
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:07,472
Let's head back.

172
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:09,015
Shouldn't we look for him?

173
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:10,225
Forget it.

174
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:13,103
Would he associate himself with us
now that he's human?

175
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:15,689
Woo-hyeol isn't like that!

176
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:19,609
Where could he be
out in this dangerous world?

177
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:24,281
I'm famished.

178
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:27,492
My gosh.

179
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:30,078
Gosh.

180
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:32,247
Goodness me.

181
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:39,921
KOREAN RED CROSS

182
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,550
BLOOD DONATION CENTER

183
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:55,604
No, I should head home first.

184
00:14:56,313 --> 00:14:57,522
Home first.

185
00:14:58,523 --> 00:14:59,691
Home...

186
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,153
Right.

187
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:05,030
Good.

188
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:10,285
Excuse me, could you
give me some directions?

189
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:13,788
How can I get to Shaded Oasis?

190
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,252
Look here. I am talking to you.

191
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:21,838
- Hey, I'm sorry I'm late.
- You're here.

192
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,423
- It's okay. Let's go.
- Okay.

193
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:33,892
RESERVED

194
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,143
What?

195
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:39,272
VACANT

196
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:41,441
Right.

197
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:43,860
I can get into one of those.

198
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:52,702
What do you think you are doing?

199
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,537
I'm the one who called this cab.

200
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:56,915
What?

201
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:58,917
What the...

202
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,835
What an insolent man!

203
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:16,059
Mr. Ko?

204
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:24,484
Mr. Ko!

205
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:27,320
Wait...

206
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:35,578
TO BE DEMOLISHED

207
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:41,042
TO BE DEMOLISHED

208
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:51,469
TO BE DEMOLISHED

209
00:17:41,853 --> 00:17:43,396
It's not like I have anywhere else to go.

210
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:00,914
Mr. Ko.

211
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:05,835
Wait for me.

212
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:18,598
Mr. Ko, where are you going?

213
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:21,392
Wait up.

214
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:23,603
Mr. Ko?

215
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:27,482
Mr. Ko?

216
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:31,027
Mr. Ko?

217
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:34,823
What?

218
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,367
He's not Mr. Ko?

219
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:54,425
As if waking me up
a day early wasn't enough.

220
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:55,802
How could she abandon me?

221
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:01,057
I'm going to teach her a lesson.

222
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,101
I won't let this slide!

223
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,061
Unbelievable.

224
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:06,813
What did you just say?

225
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,441
Were you yelling at the cat?

226
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:17,824
Well...

227
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:22,412
We saw you following the cat
down the road.

228
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:25,665
That's not it.

229
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:27,584
I only followed the cat here

230
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,419
thinking that he was Mr. Ko.

231
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:31,671
Mr. Ko is a cat I know.

232
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:33,590
I mean, a person I know.

233
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:34,799
- What is he saying?
- What?

234
00:19:34,883 --> 00:19:37,552
Stop pestering the poor cat
and move along.

235
00:19:38,303 --> 00:19:39,304
Aren't you leaving?

236
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:42,140
Get going already.

237
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:46,102
You seem like decent people
who look out for helpless cats.

238
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:49,564
Would you also be willing to help me?

239
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:55,987
SHADED OASIS

240
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,573
NO RESULT FOUND

241
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:00,033
There's no Shaded Oasis.

242
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:04,537
Do you remember any shops around it?

243
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:11,961
Until next time then.

244
00:20:15,173 --> 00:20:16,174
OSIO RASA

245
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:17,467
Osio Rasa.

246
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:19,636
Otherwise known as Osio Tailor Shop.

247
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:21,721
- "Osio Tailor Shop"?
- "Osio"?

248
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:23,640
I used to be a regular there.

249
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:25,183
OSIO TAILOR SHOP

250
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:26,768
There is one!

251
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:28,186
It'll take 15 minutes on foot.

252
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:29,729
It's close by.

253
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:37,153
DAEBAK BUTCHER SHOP, OSIO TAILOR SHOP,
CURRENT LOCATION

254
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:47,997
What the...

255
00:20:48,957 --> 00:20:50,708
Thank you for keeping the business alive.

256
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:53,336
You look just like your ancestor.

257
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:56,673
Your family
will be blessed for generations.

258
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:03,388
What the hell?

259
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:06,683
What was that?

260
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:08,476
Well...

261
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:12,647
Some crazy guy told me
my family will be blessed for generations.

262
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,857
- What?
- He came out of nowhere and...

263
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:16,567
Unbelievable.

264
00:21:16,818 --> 00:21:19,529
He may be crazy, but that's nice of him.

265
00:21:20,154 --> 00:21:22,281
- Shouldn't you get going?
- I should.

266
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:25,576
Couldn't he say something nice to me too?

267
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,203
Don't be silly.

268
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:46,347
Look at you

269
00:21:47,849 --> 00:21:49,434
standing tall after all these years.

270
00:23:12,225 --> 00:23:13,518
Now is not the time for this.

271
00:23:25,196 --> 00:23:27,907
If I spend one more day
in the hawthorn coffin...

272
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:30,118
That's right.

273
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:29,719
Why are you back?

274
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:32,388
- You.
- Have you seriously lost your mind?

275
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:36,100
Did you think

276
00:24:37,351 --> 00:24:38,644
I wouldn't be able to find you?

277
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:43,691
Whatever.

278
00:24:43,774 --> 00:24:46,068
I'm done talking to you,
so leave before I call the cops.

279
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:48,613
Why would I leave when this is my home?

280
00:24:48,696 --> 00:24:49,739
You leave.

281
00:24:54,744 --> 00:24:56,370
How dare you glare at me again?

282
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:58,164
As if that'll do you any good.

283
00:25:07,882 --> 00:25:10,176
- Can you back it up?
- Back what up?

284
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:12,720
Can you prove that the house is yours?

285
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:14,680
You must have a contract or something.

286
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:18,851
The key to the house.

287
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:22,480
Why do you have it
if you aren't Butler Joo's descendant?

288
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,065
This?

289
00:25:24,649 --> 00:25:25,733
That's right.

290
00:25:26,067 --> 00:25:28,277
That is the key I gave Butler Joo

291
00:25:28,611 --> 00:25:31,697
to signify that he was in charge
of managing the house in my absence.

292
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,826
I can't believe how one can spew

293
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:37,662
- such detailed nonsense.
- What?

294
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:40,248
My day has been hard enough
because of you.

295
00:25:40,331 --> 00:25:43,417
Your medical bill and my cab fare
weren't chump change.

296
00:25:43,501 --> 00:25:46,754
If I sue you for mental distress...

297
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:52,843
So please, let this be over
when I ask nicely.

298
00:25:55,263 --> 00:25:59,183
Aren't you curious about why I was asleep
in a coffin in the basement

299
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,104
and about the relationship I had
with your ancestor?

300
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:05,106
Not at all.

301
00:26:06,774 --> 00:26:08,192
Oh, come on!

302
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:11,153
I stayed in that coffin to become human,

303
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:12,697
but you ruined everything!

304
00:26:13,114 --> 00:26:14,991
Because you woke me up a day early...

305
00:26:16,534 --> 00:26:19,787
Do you know what I had to endure
in that coffin?

306
00:26:28,713 --> 00:26:30,881
I couldn't change positions
even though my back ached.

307
00:26:31,674 --> 00:26:33,843
I had to endure bugs and insects
going in and out

308
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:35,845
of every hole in my body.

309
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:44,145
Spirits haunted me
whenever the seasons changed.

310
00:26:48,691 --> 00:26:49,692
You startled me.

311
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:50,776
I'm not human.

312
00:26:51,485 --> 00:26:52,486
So get lost.

313
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:54,447
Wait, you're not human?

314
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:57,950
Do you have any idea
how excruciating it was?

315
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,081
Sure.

316
00:27:04,665 --> 00:27:06,917
So you're a vampire

317
00:27:07,668 --> 00:27:10,796
and you were inside a coffin
to become human.

318
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,548
With a day left until 100 years,

319
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:15,634
you failed to become human
because I opened the coffin.

320
00:27:19,764 --> 00:27:21,390
Finally, we're on the same page.

321
00:27:23,517 --> 00:27:25,853
Cut the nonsense, will you?

322
00:27:25,936 --> 00:27:27,646
If that were true,

323
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:29,857
you should've locked the coffin

324
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,526
or written a warning saying,
"Do not open."

325
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:33,652
Damn it!

326
00:27:34,737 --> 00:27:35,780
Why you...

327
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:42,620
Where on earth is your father?

328
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,081
How could he not have told you anything?

329
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:46,624
I must hold him accountable!

330
00:27:46,707 --> 00:27:48,334
I don't even know if he's dead or alive!

331
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,419
He abandoned his family
because of money issues.

332
00:27:50,503 --> 00:27:53,255
This is all he left me,
so I should at least take it.

333
00:27:53,798 --> 00:27:56,550
I'm not in a situation to be picky.

334
00:27:58,469 --> 00:27:59,470
Goodness!

335
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:02,098
My goodness.

336
00:28:06,477 --> 00:28:07,478
Since this is the case,

337
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,064
I will have no choice
but to reveal my true self.

338
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:13,401
How? Are you going to show me
your fangs or something?

339
00:28:17,822 --> 00:28:19,615
You better brace yourself.

340
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:33,337
Is that it?

341
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:51,313
- Get out.
- Hold on!

342
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:17,131
Is that it?

343
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:24,430
Is that it?

344
00:29:32,188 --> 00:29:33,189
Is that it?

345
00:29:43,073 --> 00:29:44,408
Will this not work either?

346
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:50,915
Look straight into my eyes.

347
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:53,250
Hypnosis?

348
00:29:54,668 --> 00:29:56,837
Sure. Have at it.

349
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:05,971
What?

350
00:30:11,185 --> 00:30:12,311
I see myself...

351
00:30:15,898 --> 00:30:17,149
in your eyes.

352
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,336
You crazy bastard!

353
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:39,672
- Hold on.
- Get out.

354
00:30:39,922 --> 00:30:41,131
What?

355
00:30:42,258 --> 00:30:45,219
If you come back in here
claiming to be a vampire again,

356
00:30:45,302 --> 00:30:47,179
I'll make you pay.

357
00:30:48,931 --> 00:30:49,974
What?

358
00:30:52,142 --> 00:30:53,143
Hey.

359
00:30:53,227 --> 00:30:55,104
Open up.

360
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:58,023
This is my home.

361
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:00,526
Open the door.

362
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:03,654
My gosh.

363
00:31:03,988 --> 00:31:05,864
I woke up after 100 years

364
00:31:05,948 --> 00:31:07,783
but haven't been able to drink
a drop of blood.

365
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:10,035
I feel so weak.

366
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:13,831
I couldn't even fight

367
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,375
a human girl.

368
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:23,799
My goodness.

369
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:27,636
Anyway,

370
00:31:28,846 --> 00:31:30,556
where in the world

371
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:33,392
are Dong-seop and Sang-hae?

372
00:31:54,705 --> 00:31:57,333
Why did Dad keep a house like this?

373
00:33:23,293 --> 00:33:24,878
I hope he doesn't come back.

374
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:40,686
DELICIOUS CUP NOODLES

375
00:34:23,854 --> 00:34:25,355
That's right. Mr. Ko.

376
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:28,817
Mr. Ko?

377
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:36,158
The trash?

378
00:34:38,035 --> 00:34:40,537
What is he doing there?

379
00:34:48,003 --> 00:34:49,046
Damn it!

380
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,966
Oh, gosh.

381
00:34:54,468 --> 00:34:56,011
Did our eyes meet?

382
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:58,388
I hope not.

383
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:02,768
Is he gone? He has to be.

384
00:35:03,185 --> 00:35:04,353
He's gone.

385
00:35:28,502 --> 00:35:29,670
Go ahead.

386
00:35:30,254 --> 00:35:32,506
You must still feel weak after fainting.

387
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:35,342
Have this instead of digging up the trash.

388
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,637
I have an extra.

389
00:35:45,936 --> 00:35:48,272
Never have I smelled anything
so flavorful before.

390
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:51,859
DELICIOUS CUP NOODLES

391
00:36:02,578 --> 00:36:04,246
Reacting to food that isn't blood?

392
00:36:05,122 --> 00:36:08,000
Could I truly be close to becoming human?

393
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:23,891
No way.

394
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,312
I can taste the flavors.

395
00:36:28,729 --> 00:36:31,815
Goodness. Could it be any tastier?

396
00:36:32,316 --> 00:36:35,027
It's 100 times, no 1 000 times,

397
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,821
no 10 000 times better than blood.

398
00:36:38,906 --> 00:36:40,032
Oh, my god.

399
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:48,916
Isn't it hot?

400
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:53,587
It is.

401
00:37:05,474 --> 00:37:06,892
That was insane.

402
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:13,607
That tasted insane!

403
00:37:14,024 --> 00:37:16,652
What are you doing? Everyone's looking!

404
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:17,945
Sit.

405
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,197
I'm sorry.

406
00:37:23,033 --> 00:37:24,534
What's wrong? Are you okay?

407
00:37:24,785 --> 00:37:26,495
Something this tasty...

408
00:37:27,704 --> 00:37:28,747
Have humans...

409
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:33,460
Have humans been enjoying this
all by themselves?

410
00:37:38,382 --> 00:37:39,424
What's going on?

411
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:42,386
Are you all right?

412
00:37:44,513 --> 00:37:45,722
If...

413
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:50,644
If I had stayed in the coffin
for one more day,

414
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:55,357
I would've become human.

415
00:37:56,358 --> 00:37:57,818
I would've enjoyed delectable food.

416
00:37:58,860 --> 00:37:59,903
But you!

417
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:02,906
You...

418
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:04,908
You ruined everything!

419
00:38:05,325 --> 00:38:08,537
You woke me up a day early.

420
00:38:08,954 --> 00:38:10,372
You ruined it all.

421
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:12,666
You ruined everything.

422
00:38:14,835 --> 00:38:16,336
So set it straight!

423
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:18,630
Set it straight!

424
00:38:18,714 --> 00:38:20,549
I want to be human too.

425
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:22,217
Until I become human...

426
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,387
Take care of me until I become human.

427
00:38:25,721 --> 00:38:27,556
What's his problem?

428
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:30,934
What?

429
00:38:31,018 --> 00:38:32,102
Hey.

430
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:33,937
Are you okay?

431
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:36,481
You're messing with me, right?

432
00:38:37,232 --> 00:38:38,233
Right?

433
00:38:39,693 --> 00:38:41,278
Don't tell me you're drunk.

434
00:38:42,446 --> 00:38:44,364
You're drunk on noodles?

435
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:46,950
Unbelievable.

436
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:50,162
You can't be like this here.

437
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:51,246
Get up.

438
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:52,914
Get up already!

439
00:39:06,303 --> 00:39:07,387
Hae-sun.

440
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:10,432
What are you doing?

441
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:17,022
Hae-sun, wait for me.

442
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:20,901
Wait for me.

443
00:39:22,736 --> 00:39:23,820
Woo-hyeol.

444
00:39:27,491 --> 00:39:28,533
Hurry.

445
00:39:41,671 --> 00:39:42,881
What do you think?

446
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:45,801
This will be our secret hideout.

447
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:46,885
Isn't it great?

448
00:39:49,179 --> 00:39:53,225
Look. We'll stack firewood here
and light a fire.

449
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:55,894
We will bake sweet potatoes, potatoes,

450
00:39:55,977 --> 00:39:57,104
and grill pheasant...

451
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:01,483
All I talked about was food.

452
00:40:04,236 --> 00:40:06,988
Are you sure we can do that here?

453
00:40:11,368 --> 00:40:12,869
You can't sleep here.

454
00:40:13,453 --> 00:40:15,539
Excuse me. You can't sleep here.

455
00:40:15,622 --> 00:40:17,332
Please get up.

456
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,300
You can't sleep here.

457
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:34,641
Where did the lady here go?

458
00:40:34,724 --> 00:40:36,184
How should I know?

459
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:38,228
Clean up before you leave.

460
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:52,617
Again?

461
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,245
She abandoned me yet again.

462
00:40:55,579 --> 00:40:57,164
She's so heartless.

463
00:40:58,206 --> 00:40:59,291
Goodness.

464
00:41:04,004 --> 00:41:05,088
Mr. Ko...

465
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:10,135
As if I'd be fooled again.

466
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:15,056
Why is it so steep?

467
00:41:19,728 --> 00:41:22,314
You should greet a cat when you see one.

468
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:28,570
Where are your manners?

469
00:41:29,529 --> 00:41:30,530
Seriously.

470
00:41:32,574 --> 00:41:33,783
Mr. Ko.

471
00:41:40,248 --> 00:41:42,083
- Have you been well?
- Yes.

472
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:44,127
It's been a while.

473
00:41:48,298 --> 00:41:51,426
I see that you failed to become human.

474
00:41:56,181 --> 00:41:59,059
Yes, I'm afraid I woke up a day too early.

475
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:09,152
You're neither a vampire
nor a human being.

476
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,696
How could this be?

477
00:42:21,456 --> 00:42:24,209
I tried to go back
into the coffin to sleep, but...

478
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:26,628
You would've turned into charcoal
if you had.

479
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:28,755
How did you know that?

480
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:30,966
The coffin had already
turned into charcoal.

481
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:34,469
Without its owner,
a coffin loses its purpose.

482
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:37,931
It spent all its power
sucking the vampire energy from you.

483
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:41,059
It did its job, so nature ran its course.

484
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:44,354
So where do I go from here?

485
00:42:44,938 --> 00:42:46,273
Is there another way?

486
00:42:48,525 --> 00:42:52,070
What did you hear
when the coffin was shut?

487
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:57,450
- Screech and then thud.
- Yes, it was a dud.

488
00:42:58,034 --> 00:42:59,953
- Sorry?
- Would it have killed you

489
00:43:00,036 --> 00:43:02,038
to hold it out for one more day?

490
00:43:02,956 --> 00:43:05,083
I wouldn't be frustrated
if I had opened it myself.

491
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:07,544
Some girl opened it and woke me up.

492
00:43:07,794 --> 00:43:10,338
My blood still boils
when I think about it.

493
00:43:10,422 --> 00:43:11,589
Hold on.

494
00:43:11,673 --> 00:43:12,882
What did you just say?

495
00:43:14,801 --> 00:43:16,970
A female human being opened the coffin?

496
00:43:18,221 --> 00:43:19,306
Yes.

497
00:43:20,265 --> 00:43:21,433
Is there something wrong?

498
00:43:22,017 --> 00:43:25,228
Well, the coffin can't be easily opened.

499
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:45,665
Hello?

500
00:43:47,917 --> 00:43:48,960
What?

501
00:43:51,796 --> 00:43:53,798
Just a second!

502
00:43:53,882 --> 00:43:55,133
Stop!

503
00:43:56,301 --> 00:43:58,219
What on earth are you doing?

504
00:43:58,303 --> 00:44:00,096
You can't do this without fair warning!

505
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:02,390
All my stuff is still in there!

506
00:44:02,474 --> 00:44:04,476
You should've moved them sooner.

507
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:06,519
How can one move out in a day?

508
00:44:06,603 --> 00:44:08,772
The man who conned me
took off with all my money.

509
00:44:08,855 --> 00:44:11,441
Look, I get that the situation
isn't ideal for you,

510
00:44:11,524 --> 00:44:13,068
but that isn't on us.

511
00:44:13,485 --> 00:44:14,861
We have a job to do as well.

512
00:44:15,278 --> 00:44:16,654
- Move.
- Let's get to work.

513
00:44:16,738 --> 00:44:18,990
You can't! I won't budge.

514
00:44:19,074 --> 00:44:20,367
I'm staying right here!

515
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:21,868
What's going on?

516
00:44:21,951 --> 00:44:25,330
We're busy people
and can't accommodate your sob story.

517
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:27,415
- Move.
- No, I won't budge.

518
00:44:27,499 --> 00:44:29,459
- Goodness. Toss everything out!
- I won't!

519
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:32,087
Toss out all her belongings!

520
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:33,380
- Please move.
- You can't!

521
00:44:33,463 --> 00:44:34,547
- Hurry!
- You can't!

522
00:44:34,631 --> 00:44:35,632
- Move her things.
- My gosh.

523
00:44:35,715 --> 00:44:37,509
- My goodness! Wait.
- Toss them out.

524
00:44:37,592 --> 00:44:40,011
You can't throw out my things like this.

525
00:44:40,095 --> 00:44:41,304
Wait.

526
00:44:41,971 --> 00:44:44,682
Just give me some time!

527
00:44:44,891 --> 00:44:48,561
Okay, I'll move everything out,
so at least give me the time to do so.

528
00:44:48,645 --> 00:44:50,230
Seriously?

529
00:44:51,648 --> 00:44:53,525
Come on!

530
00:44:53,608 --> 00:44:56,736
Give me some time to move out!

531
00:44:58,154 --> 00:44:59,572
What are you doing?

532
00:44:59,656 --> 00:45:02,033
Goodness, you're here, sir.

533
00:45:03,576 --> 00:45:04,577
What is this about?

534
00:45:04,661 --> 00:45:07,539
The tenant is hindering the demolition,
but it'll be over soon.

535
00:45:09,374 --> 00:45:11,209
Is this how you do business?

536
00:45:11,584 --> 00:45:13,586
- Sorry?
- It's the 21st century.

537
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:15,588
What if someone gets hurt?

538
00:45:15,672 --> 00:45:18,508
Can I hold you accountable if the company
suffers a blow to its image?

539
00:45:18,591 --> 00:45:21,052
That's not it, sir.
I was just trying to expedite things.

540
00:45:22,137 --> 00:45:23,263
Stop everything this instant.

541
00:45:27,392 --> 00:45:28,435
Are you okay?

542
00:45:32,856 --> 00:45:33,940
Are you...

543
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:36,151
Joo In-hae?

544
00:45:39,988 --> 00:45:41,281
Do-sik?

545
00:45:49,456 --> 00:45:51,416
NURSING FOR WOMEN'S HEALTH 1

546
00:46:04,262 --> 00:46:05,263
Watch out!

547
00:46:12,437 --> 00:46:13,480
I'm sorry.

548
00:46:13,938 --> 00:46:14,981
Are you all right?

549
00:46:16,566 --> 00:46:17,692
Are you hurt?

550
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:21,863
Your hand is bleeding.

551
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:45,637
JOO IN-HAE

552
00:46:57,524 --> 00:46:58,733
You're good.

553
00:46:59,484 --> 00:47:01,110
- Thank you.
- It's nothing.

554
00:47:01,402 --> 00:47:02,946
You only got hurt swerving out of my way.

555
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:06,032
It could scar, so go see a doctor.

556
00:47:30,932 --> 00:47:33,351
It's been a while. We haven't seen
each other since graduation, right?

557
00:47:35,228 --> 00:47:36,437
Probably.

558
00:47:37,689 --> 00:47:39,440
I'm sorry we met
under these circumstances.

559
00:47:40,817 --> 00:47:42,068
Housing fraud?

560
00:47:42,735 --> 00:47:43,945
I feel terrible.

561
00:47:45,446 --> 00:47:48,491
I haven't been too aware
of the work my employees do.

562
00:47:49,534 --> 00:47:50,743
I'm sorry.

563
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:53,830
Don't be. You have no reason to be.

564
00:47:54,289 --> 00:47:56,833
The one to blame is the crook
who took off with my money.

565
00:48:01,004 --> 00:48:02,380
Do you have a place to stay?

566
00:48:05,133 --> 00:48:06,843
Yes, I do.

567
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:09,804
I'm glad to hear that.

568
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:14,851
Is there anything I can help you with?

569
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:17,604
I feel responsible in a way.

570
00:48:18,021 --> 00:48:20,607
No, it's all right.
Please don't feel burdened.

571
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:23,276
- But still...
- I'll take care of it.

572
00:48:25,278 --> 00:48:27,739
And I'll move my things out
by the end of the week.

573
00:48:30,491 --> 00:48:31,534
You haven't changed at all.

574
00:48:32,702 --> 00:48:34,245
You're still reluctant to accept help.

575
00:48:41,377 --> 00:48:43,087
Take care, Do-sik.

576
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:50,219
Call me if anything happens.

577
00:48:51,304 --> 00:48:53,765
- Okay.
- Promise that you will.

578
00:48:54,724 --> 00:48:55,975
Don't take it all on yourself.

579
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:12,325
CEO SHIN DO-SIK
REFRESH REAL ESTATE CONSULTING

580
00:49:20,667 --> 00:49:22,085
- Mr. Gu.
- Yes, sir.

581
00:49:22,168 --> 00:49:25,546
Can we look into the housing fraud
that recently occurred?

582
00:49:25,922 --> 00:49:27,256
Of course, sir.

583
00:49:57,578 --> 00:49:59,664
Where on earth did she go?

584
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:08,089
No human can open a coffin
occupied by a slumbering vampire.

585
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:11,718
The fact that she opened it and awoke you

586
00:50:12,468 --> 00:50:14,137
tells me she is no ordinary human.

587
00:50:15,847 --> 00:50:17,765
Keep her by your side
and keep an eye on her.

588
00:50:19,058 --> 00:50:21,519
She might be the one holding the key.

589
00:50:27,191 --> 00:50:28,234
Butler Joo.

590
00:50:29,444 --> 00:50:30,570
Butler Joo.

591
00:50:31,237 --> 00:50:32,405
Who are you?

592
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:36,367
No one lives in this house.

593
00:50:36,451 --> 00:50:37,493
What is this about?

594
00:50:42,373 --> 00:50:43,958
I am the owner of this house.

595
00:50:44,709 --> 00:50:45,793
What?

596
00:50:47,003 --> 00:50:48,045
You see,

597
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:52,008
due to a personal matter,
I had to vacate the house for some time.

598
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:55,887
Anyway, I am the rightful proprietor
of this place.

599
00:50:56,387 --> 00:50:59,182
Why does a young man
talk in such an old-fashioned way?

600
00:51:00,016 --> 00:51:02,435
Is this what's trending these days?

601
00:51:03,352 --> 00:51:05,813
Anyway, what brings you by?

602
00:51:06,355 --> 00:51:08,816
I've lived in this neighborhood
for 20 years,

603
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:10,735
and your face isn't one I recognize.

604
00:51:12,236 --> 00:51:14,906
Why can't you enter
when it's supposedly your place?

605
00:51:18,618 --> 00:51:21,078
Someone took the key.

606
00:51:21,162 --> 00:51:22,205
Who?

607
00:51:22,288 --> 00:51:24,874
I run a butcher shop down the road.

608
00:51:24,957 --> 00:51:26,959
Why don't you come by for some coffee
while you wait?

609
00:51:27,043 --> 00:51:29,212
No, I decline.

610
00:51:30,338 --> 00:51:31,380
Very well then.

611
00:51:49,607 --> 00:51:50,650
WHERE LOVE BEGINS

612
00:51:50,733 --> 00:51:52,944
- Good girl.
- Thank you so much.

613
00:51:53,027 --> 00:51:54,695
Thank you. I wish you happiness.

614
00:51:56,072 --> 00:51:57,824
Enjoy a day of happiness.

615
00:51:59,408 --> 00:52:01,160
Let's help our neighbors.

616
00:52:01,244 --> 00:52:03,246
Let's share love.

617
00:52:03,329 --> 00:52:04,497
Let's share...

618
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:06,582
You.

619
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:09,627
Right.

620
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:12,880
- Right.
- Right.

621
00:52:12,964 --> 00:52:14,048
It's you.

622
00:52:14,715 --> 00:52:17,260
- I see.
- Where are you going, you crook?

623
00:52:17,343 --> 00:52:18,845
Are you stealing donations this time?

624
00:52:18,928 --> 00:52:21,973
Why are you harassing me at my workplace?

625
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:23,891
Damn it.

626
00:52:23,975 --> 00:52:26,018
Hey! Stop right there, you bastard!

627
00:52:26,102 --> 00:52:27,103
Damn it.

628
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:30,690
How dare you take off
with my money, you bastard!

629
00:52:30,773 --> 00:52:31,774
Just wait until I catch you.

630
00:52:31,858 --> 00:52:35,444
If I do, you'll be dead meat!

631
00:52:42,952 --> 00:52:44,328
Damn you!

632
00:53:01,762 --> 00:53:02,763
I'm sorry.

633
00:53:13,941 --> 00:53:15,693
- What the hell?
- Stop right there!

634
00:53:27,496 --> 00:53:28,497
Damn it!

635
00:53:32,919 --> 00:53:35,004
Stop right there, you crook!

636
00:53:38,925 --> 00:53:39,967
Stop!

637
00:53:41,969 --> 00:53:43,554
Gosh, go away.

638
00:53:45,264 --> 00:53:46,724
I told you to stop!

639
00:53:51,062 --> 00:53:53,147
Stop right there! Stop!

640
00:53:53,648 --> 00:53:54,690
No!

641
00:53:55,816 --> 00:53:57,443
Would you stop if you were me?

642
00:54:02,406 --> 00:54:03,491
Where did he go?

643
00:54:51,122 --> 00:54:54,000
I sensed her around here.

644
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:14,437
- This is...
- You probably haven't had

645
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,230
a single drop of blood since you woke up.

646
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:18,190
You won't last in that state.

647
00:55:19,734 --> 00:55:22,778
You must hold out at all costs
until you become human.

648
00:55:25,364 --> 00:55:26,449
Keep this in mind.

649
00:55:26,532 --> 00:55:28,409
If anything bad happens to her,

650
00:55:29,577 --> 00:55:31,370
all will have been for nothing.

651
00:55:32,997 --> 00:55:36,042
You must keep her by your side
and protect her.

652
00:56:50,324 --> 00:56:51,992
I finally managed to shake her off.

653
00:56:52,368 --> 00:56:53,369
You.

654
00:56:56,622 --> 00:56:59,708
Stop chasing me, you leech!

655
00:57:00,793 --> 00:57:03,379
Give me back my money!

656
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:06,090
Stop right there!

657
00:57:07,591 --> 00:57:08,926
Let's see how long you can run.

658
00:57:09,009 --> 00:57:11,178
I'll catch you today at all costs

659
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:12,930
and get back my money!

660
00:57:41,834 --> 00:57:43,460
Where did this weasel hide?

661
00:57:50,593 --> 00:57:53,721
You're one tenacious bitch.

662
00:57:53,804 --> 00:57:56,265
I shouldn't have taken you in as a tenant.

663
00:57:56,348 --> 00:57:59,351
- Give me back my money.
- Shut up! As if I have any.

664
00:57:59,602 --> 00:58:01,353
Give me the money you stole from me.

665
00:58:01,604 --> 00:58:03,647
Or I'll sue you for today's incident too.

666
00:58:03,731 --> 00:58:04,732
Hey.

667
00:58:04,815 --> 00:58:07,234
You talk too much!

668
00:58:08,235 --> 00:58:09,236
What?

669
00:58:32,176 --> 00:58:34,220
Damn it. What the hell?

670
00:58:38,224 --> 00:58:40,309
Who the hell are you?

671
00:58:58,285 --> 00:59:00,788
Kids shouldn't play with these things.

672
00:59:12,007 --> 00:59:15,010
What are you, a circus strongman?

673
00:59:16,762 --> 00:59:17,763
Hey.

674
00:59:33,404 --> 00:59:35,739
You're...

675
00:59:35,823 --> 00:59:37,241
You're a monster.

676
00:59:38,742 --> 00:59:40,494
Die, you monster!

677
01:00:08,897 --> 01:00:09,982
Are you okay?

678
01:00:10,524 --> 01:00:11,567
Was it...

679
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:13,694
Was it true?

680
01:00:14,945 --> 01:00:16,071
Are you really...

681
01:00:17,364 --> 01:00:18,574
a vampire?

682
01:00:21,577 --> 01:00:23,620
Do you believe me now?

683
01:00:31,879 --> 01:00:32,880
Let's...

684
01:00:33,547 --> 01:00:34,631
go home.

685
01:01:20,386 --> 01:01:23,305
HEARTBEAT

686
01:01:23,389 --> 01:01:24,598
I'll pay in full.

687
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:26,100
Who said you could use my card?

688
01:01:26,183 --> 01:01:28,102
Why?!

689
01:01:28,185 --> 01:01:29,728
Do you have any money saved up?

690
01:01:30,104 --> 01:01:32,398
Work your ass off to pay me back.

691
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:34,817
I got you a job at a funeral service.

692
01:01:35,275 --> 01:01:36,819
I got you a job delivering dairy drinks.

693
01:01:37,236 --> 01:01:38,779
Get lost this instant! Damn it!

694
01:01:39,238 --> 01:01:40,823
He's no human.

695
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:43,742
He's a vampire. She saw him too!

696
01:01:43,826 --> 01:01:45,202
Your hand is quite cold.

697
01:01:45,285 --> 01:01:46,286
Cold hypersensitivity!

698
01:01:46,829 --> 01:01:49,206
Are you not afraid of me?

699
01:01:49,498 --> 01:01:51,458
I'm not that afraid of you.

700
01:01:51,542 --> 01:01:53,419
But I'm not human.

701
01:01:54,086 --> 01:01:55,087
I'm a vampire.
