00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:45,296
HEARTBEAT

2
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,298
ALL CHARACTERS, NAMES,
ORGANIZATIONS, GROUPS, EVENTS,

3
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,383
AND SETTINGS ARE FICTITIOUS
AND ANIMAL SAFETY GUIDELINES WERE FOLLOWED

4
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:57,433
I need your love.

5
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:00,728
Your love.

6
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:03,397
Your love

7
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:07,193
can help me become human.

8
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:10,112
My love?

9
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:13,282
Did you say "love"?

10
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:14,325
That's right.

11
00:01:15,493 --> 00:01:18,746
Only your blood that is full of love

12
00:01:20,164 --> 00:01:21,832
can turn me into a human being.

13
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:25,085
My blood?

14
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:35,554
HEARTBEAT
EPISODE 10

15
00:01:40,184 --> 00:01:41,268
Why though?

16
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:43,270
Why must it be my blood?

17
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:45,439
Because you awoke me.

18
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:49,235
No human

19
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,363
can open a coffin occupied by a vampire.

20
00:01:53,656 --> 00:01:55,908
However, you managed the impossible.

21
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:00,704
On top of that,

22
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:02,998
you also bit me.

23
00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:10,214
I think that's when it started.

24
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:14,301
After that moment,
a link formed between us.

25
00:02:15,094 --> 00:02:16,470
A link?

26
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:20,599
My wound throbs whenever you're in danger.

27
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:23,519
It's like you're sending me a signal.

28
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:26,814
And most importantly,

29
00:02:30,109 --> 00:02:31,151
your eyes.

30
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:35,614
I can only see my reflection in your eyes.

31
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:40,411
You said before

32
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:42,913
that my blood is full of poison.

33
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:46,417
That it's far too poisonous
even for a vampire to drink.

34
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:48,878
So why are you saying that
after all this time?

35
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:50,880
If you had told me sooner--

36
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:52,089
You would've left me.

37
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:57,595
Because people are afraid of vampires.

38
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:01,932
Would you have remained by my side
knowing that I needed to drink your blood

39
00:03:03,309 --> 00:03:04,727
in order to become human?

40
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:13,193
Then where do we go from here?

41
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:16,071
You need my blood.

42
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:18,616
- Does that mean I'll die?
- Don't jump to conclusions.

43
00:03:19,742 --> 00:03:21,702
I'm not saying
I'm going to take your life.

44
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:24,955
I only wish for your poisonous blood

45
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:29,084
to be warmed up and filled with love.

46
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:32,922
And I ask that you share
your warmth with me

47
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:37,051
since I was one day short
of becoming human.

48
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:41,180
Woo-hyeol,

49
00:03:42,473 --> 00:03:45,935
human blood
is classified as type A, B, or O.

50
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:49,772
Blood full of love?

51
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:52,358
I don't get it.

52
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:53,984
I know nothing of the sort.

53
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:07,206
I must find a half-vampire
with a scar on their body.

54
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,000
It's the only way to lift

55
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:12,252
this damn curse.

56
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:14,713
It won't be easy though.

57
00:04:15,506 --> 00:04:19,134
Both my father and grandfather
failed miserably.

58
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:23,305
And I don't know
how much time I have left.

59
00:04:23,514 --> 00:04:25,349
You don't need to say more.

60
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:28,143
I will end the curse in any way I can.

61
00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:30,854
And I'll help in any way I can.

62
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:57,089
Mr. Ko.

63
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,468
You look like a dead man walking.

64
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,595
I guess things aren't going well.

65
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:06,265
Could you please refrain
from talking about death around me?

66
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:07,224
Right.

67
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:09,101
Sorry about that.

68
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:18,027
I ended up telling her everything.

69
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:21,989
I told her that I need blood full of love

70
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:25,159
to become human.

71
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:27,161
Is that so?

72
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:28,662
How did she respond?

73
00:05:28,746 --> 00:05:29,788
She didn't believe me.

74
00:05:29,872 --> 00:05:31,665
What do you mean by that?

75
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:33,834
She said she doesn't believe
one can have blood that is full of love

76
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:36,045
and that she knows nothing of the sort.

77
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:40,466
I guess it can be difficult
for humans to understand.

78
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:48,098
Only those who have been in love
know how to love.

79
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:51,518
I've never been in love,

80
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:53,395
so I have no love to give anyone.

81
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:57,399
On top of that, I'm struggling
to even love myself right now.

82
00:05:58,317 --> 00:06:01,737
And I asked someone like that
for blood full of love.

83
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,618
Flowers that bloom on a dead tree.

84
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:09,536
How pitiful.

85
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:14,875
What's this?

86
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:17,711
Brace yourself before opening it.

87
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:20,214
What in the world is it?

88
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:35,145
See?

89
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:36,438
What did I tell you?

90
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:38,398
He's a total lunatic.

91
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:42,319
This is what Seon Woo-hyeol had?

92
00:06:42,778 --> 00:06:45,030
I found a hidden space
in the basement of Shaded Oasis.

93
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:47,241
I went down there following a hunch

94
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:49,118
and stumbled on this.

95
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:56,542
Why does he have something
that looks centuries old?

96
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:05,259
It feels like I'm looking at my past self.

97
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:10,556
I must find out

98
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,765
who this woman is.

99
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:13,350
I may not know for sure,

100
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:15,811
but I bet it'll blow your mind.

101
00:07:17,146 --> 00:07:18,272
What do you mean by that?

102
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:20,440
Do you know something more?

103
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:28,490
Pay for my services first.

104
00:07:47,593 --> 00:07:49,469
Did you sleep well last night?

105
00:07:49,553 --> 00:07:51,513
How could I after hearing all that?

106
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,558
Then you must be tired.

107
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:59,021
I thought all night about what you said.

108
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:00,230
And?

109
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:02,482
I'm afraid it won't happen.

110
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:04,693
I see.

111
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:08,530
I wouldn't mind giving you my blood at all

112
00:08:08,614 --> 00:08:10,199
since it's the same as blood donation.

113
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:13,410
But what you want is blood full of love.

114
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:17,247
What must one do
to have blood full of love?

115
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,791
Can that even happen?

116
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:22,044
Rather than saying you can't,

117
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:23,670
why don't you give it a try?

118
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:25,422
I'll try my best as well.

119
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,424
No amount of effort
can change one's blood.

120
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:31,595
Just don't get your hopes up

121
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:34,139
since it's not something I can control.

122
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,391
All right.

123
00:08:44,316 --> 00:08:45,442
Hello?

124
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:47,861
What?

125
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,572
Hold on. Do-sik is what?

126
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,741
Right.

127
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:54,159
Thank you for letting me know.

128
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:56,787
Did something happen to Do-sik?

129
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,247
He collapsed and is in the hospital.

130
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,998
- I'm heading out.
- Okay.

131
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,630
She seems quite concerned about him.

132
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:15,180
Judging by her reaction,
it doesn't seem completely hopeless.

133
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:27,859
GUKIL JUNGANG MEDICAL CENTER

134
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:31,446
Come in.

135
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:38,620
In-hae, how did you...

136
00:09:38,704 --> 00:09:39,997
Are you okay?

137
00:09:41,123 --> 00:09:42,040
What?

138
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,042
Right, well...

139
00:09:47,838 --> 00:09:49,715
I didn't want you to see me like this.

140
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:51,550
That's what you're worried about?

141
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:54,136
What did the doctor say?
Are the test results back?

142
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,263
I heard you suddenly collapsed.

143
00:09:57,723 --> 00:09:59,224
Why are you laughing?

144
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:01,018
There's nothing funny about the situation.

145
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:02,728
There's that scary expression of yours.

146
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:03,770
Do-sik.

147
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:06,815
My tests came back clean. I'm fine.

148
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:08,900
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

149
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,531
If I had known,

150
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,075
I would've gotten you supplements
rather than a necktie.

151
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,119
This is much better than a gift.

152
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:21,830
You visiting me in the hospital

153
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:23,957
and worrying about me.

154
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:28,295
So this is how it feels
to have someone care about you.

155
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,475
I see you were outside.

156
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:45,270
What brings you by at this hour?

157
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:47,773
Isn't it obvious? I'm here to see you.

158
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,859
Didn't you miss me?

159
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:53,028
You never called me
after saying such things.

160
00:10:56,782 --> 00:10:58,784
Check the bags under my eyes.

161
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:00,952
Your words kept me curious all night.

162
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:05,040
I apologize. It wasn't my intention.

163
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:07,417
Is Ms. Joo inside?

164
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:08,627
Well...

165
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:11,880
She hurried out after hearing
that Do-sik was in the hospital.

166
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:13,340
Mr. Shin?

167
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:15,258
Is he ill?

168
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:17,719
I'm not aware of the details.

169
00:11:19,805 --> 00:11:22,474
Then why don't we talk first?

170
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:28,772
Come in.

171
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:46,957
I found a hidden space
in the basement of Shaded Oasis.

172
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,128
What did you have to say?

173
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:56,383
I've been wondering for some time.

174
00:11:57,259 --> 00:11:58,677
What's over there?

175
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:00,053
Can I take a look?

176
00:12:10,272 --> 00:12:11,857
It's fine if you feel uncomfortable.

177
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:17,946
It's all right.

178
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,073
You can go take a look.

179
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:30,500
Oh, my.

180
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,378
This is where you're staying?

181
00:12:36,882 --> 00:12:38,008
How fascinating.

182
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:40,886
It's like I'm in a different world

183
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,473
as if time has stopped in this room
a long time ago.

184
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:51,188
Goodness.

185
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:53,732
It's so cool.

186
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:57,277
You seem to like the space.

187
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,361
I really do.

188
00:13:00,489 --> 00:13:02,199
They say one's room

189
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:04,659
reflects who that person is.

190
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:08,079
It's like I'm seeing who you are inside.

191
00:13:18,507 --> 00:13:19,925
But for some reason,

192
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:21,760
it looks a bit lonely.

193
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:29,559
Isn't it lonely to be alone
in such a secret space?

194
00:13:32,938 --> 00:13:36,483
There isn't a better place
to wait for someone.

195
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:38,860
Here, you can long for that person

196
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:42,280
without realizing that time is passing by.

197
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:45,367
Is this related
to that woman named Hae-sun?

198
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:49,037
You told me
when we first met outside the mansion

199
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:51,540
that not a day went by
without thinking of her.

200
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,545
You obviously loved her enough
to embrace me the second you saw me.

201
00:13:57,796 --> 00:13:59,172
So why did you break up?

202
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,510
We didn't break up.

203
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:07,597
She passed away a long time ago.

204
00:14:08,557 --> 00:14:09,599
And it was my fault.

205
00:14:12,811 --> 00:14:14,271
When you and I first met,

206
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:17,148
it felt as though
Hae-sun had come back to life.

207
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:18,775
That's why I...

208
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:27,951
I apologize.

209
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:30,328
I shouldn't have said anything.

210
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:32,581
Please forget what I said.

211
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,126
Would you like to see what's here?

212
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:40,714
You must've loved her a lot.

213
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:46,386
Hearing about your ex should upset me,

214
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:50,640
but I can't be angry or sad.

215
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:55,103
It feels odd.

216
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:57,606
I wonder why.

217
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:01,443
Everything feels odd.

218
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:11,661
Everything that concerns you.

219
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:14,789
Me coming to this mansion,

220
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:16,833
the fact that I met you here,

221
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:20,712
and the way you look and talk to me.

222
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:22,505
What is all this?

223
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:25,675
Who are we...

224
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:27,677
to each other?

225
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:37,937
Do you...

226
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,357
recall something?

227
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:53,370
Woo-hyeol.

228
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:55,789
Are you home?

229
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:03,046
Why is it that moments like this
always get interrupted?

230
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:09,094
Hey.

231
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:13,848
Ms. Joo, you're back.

232
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,267
I came by to talk to Mr. Seon.

233
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:17,852
I see.

234
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:18,895
Gosh.

235
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,772
It's like you caught us
doing something we shouldn't have.

236
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:21,731
It's not like that.

237
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:24,693
No, that's not what I thought at all.

238
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:26,528
I'm only kidding.

239
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:28,279
You're a tough one to joke around with.

240
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:31,074
I'll get going then.

241
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:36,037
Let's continue our chat some other time.

242
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:38,748
Sure.

243
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:58,727
Were you two talking about
something important?

244
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:02,105
- No.
- I know you were.

245
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:05,567
Otherwise, you wouldn't have been
down in the basement.

246
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:10,363
You don't like having people
in your space.

247
00:17:10,447 --> 00:17:11,948
You won't even let me clean it.

248
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:17,620
Did you tell her about Hae-sun today?

249
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,249
Why would I

250
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,544
when she doesn't even
remember her former life

251
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:28,047
and I failed to become human?

252
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:30,759
Former lives and reincarnations.

253
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:33,595
She wouldn't even believe all that.

254
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:35,013
You don't either.

255
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:39,476
You said you don't believe
that blood can be full of love.

256
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:44,355
Right.

257
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:47,650
How's Do-sik? Is he all right?

258
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:50,236
Yes. Fortunately, he's doing fine.

259
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:56,743
Are you okay?

260
00:17:57,452 --> 00:17:58,453
You seem exhausted.

261
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,458
I guess being back at the hospital

262
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,502
made me tense up a little.

263
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:10,423
My mom was unwell
and was in the hospital for a long time.

264
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:15,136
So seeing patients in their gowns

265
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,679
reminds me of that time.

266
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:18,848
It was a bit much to handle.

267
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:22,185
You must miss your mother a lot.

268
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:24,270
Yes, I do.

269
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:29,651
She wanted to stay by my side
for as long as she could.

270
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:40,745
Why are you looking at me with such pity?

271
00:18:42,664 --> 00:18:43,790
I wasn't.

272
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,292
I was just thinking.

273
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:49,337
I was wondering

274
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:52,966
if people would also miss me
after I leave this world.

275
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:56,803
Why would you think that
when vampires are immortal?

276
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:00,473
Right.

277
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:03,852
I don't know why that came to mind.

278
00:19:05,562 --> 00:19:06,688
Head inside then.

279
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:08,523
I'm going to go get some fresh air.

280
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:25,290
Have you lost your mind?

281
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:28,126
Why would you tell her everything?

282
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:32,130
I also think it was careless of you.

283
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:37,594
I only told her because she asked
how I can become human.

284
00:19:39,262 --> 00:19:41,890
But I guess it's easier said than done.

285
00:19:41,973 --> 00:19:46,060
Wasn't she getting closer
to her male friend from college?

286
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:47,812
That's what I thought,

287
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:49,022
but I was wrong.

288
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:54,068
She won't open her heart to him easily.

289
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:57,488
It's safe to say that her heart
doesn't have a door that can be opened.

290
00:19:57,947 --> 00:19:59,824
She put up a wall that can't be broken.

291
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:03,745
Whose fault is it
that you didn't become human?

292
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:05,872
Does she have no conscience?

293
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:08,958
She should be trying her best
to repair the damage.

294
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,793
I heard her story,

295
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:13,546
and it seems like
she had a rough upbringing.

296
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:16,841
Her mother passed away when she was young,

297
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:18,718
and her father went missing.

298
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,596
So forget about love.
Surviving must've been hard enough.

299
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,431
I didn't know that

300
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,643
and kept pushing her into falling in love.

301
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:27,936
Hold on.

302
00:20:28,353 --> 00:20:30,438
Did you say her father went missing?

303
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:31,356
Yes.

304
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:33,524
Although I never got to meet him,

305
00:20:33,608 --> 00:20:36,235
he must've been Butler Joo's descendant

306
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:37,862
who protected me and the mansion.

307
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,656
I felt terrible.

308
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:41,908
- So he's missing.
- Yes.

309
00:20:42,784 --> 00:20:44,619
I smell something fishy.

310
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:46,829
I know. It's been
bothering me the whole time.

311
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:47,956
You didn't wash your feet, did you?

312
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:49,374
My goodness, are you serious?

313
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:50,541
As if that's anything new.

314
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:52,710
What are you doing? Hey.

315
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:54,379
- Seriously?
- It's fragrant.

316
00:20:56,881 --> 00:21:00,134
Seeing how your bills have been piling up

317
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:02,929
tells me you won't be able to
pay me on time yet again.

318
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:04,555
Pour fuel on the fire, will you?

319
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:06,391
- What's wrong?
- Damn it.

320
00:21:06,975 --> 00:21:07,934
What is it?

321
00:21:09,227 --> 00:21:10,311
What's going on?

322
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:13,398
Listen up.

323
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:15,692
Nothing is for free.

324
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:18,820
Life is all about give and take.

325
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:21,572
To get what I want,

326
00:21:21,656 --> 00:21:24,409
you must give what the other wants.

327
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:27,036
You need her blood that is full of love.

328
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,579
But would she hand it over for free?

329
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:30,331
I know I wouldn't.

330
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:31,499
I see.

331
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:32,458
What?

332
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:35,962
So what will you do for her

333
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:39,215
if she gives you her blood
that's full of love?

334
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:43,511
What could I possibly do...

335
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:45,805
for her?

336
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:49,017
Think long and hard
about what she needs the most.

337
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,309
You'll find your answer.

338
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:10,496
How can I help him
when I don't know what I can do?

339
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:14,709
What does one have to do
to have blood full of love?

340
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,924
What are you doing out here?

341
00:22:22,884 --> 00:22:23,926
Are you drinking alone?

342
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:26,471
Where's your boyfriend?

343
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:27,597
What?

344
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,099
I don't have a boyfriend.

345
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:32,852
The guy who talks funny.
Isn't he your boyfriend?

346
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:33,770
What?

347
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:34,771
Gosh, no.

348
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:36,689
Our relationship is strictly professional.

349
00:22:37,065 --> 00:22:38,858
What do you take me for?

350
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:40,276
Relax.

351
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,778
There's no need to get all defensive.

352
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:43,446
- Sorry?
- Jeez.

353
00:22:45,073 --> 00:22:46,908
Wait, So-i.

354
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:01,589
Have you been in a lot of relationships?

355
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:04,842
That hit a raw nerve.

356
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:09,806
Have you heard of the term
"trash collector"?

357
00:23:10,181 --> 00:23:12,100
- "Trash collector"?
- Yes.

358
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:13,184
What's that?

359
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:16,854
It means that I keep dating men
who are trash.

360
00:23:19,649 --> 00:23:20,525
What about you?

361
00:23:21,109 --> 00:23:22,568
Have you been in many relationships?

362
00:23:22,652 --> 00:23:24,987
Me? Well...

363
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:28,741
Don't tell me you've never been in one.

364
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:32,537
Sorry? Well, I guess...

365
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:34,914
Life has been busy for me.

366
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:37,834
As if. You're always here at the mansion.

367
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:43,881
You're right.

368
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:48,052
To be honest,
I'm not sure whether it's that

369
00:23:48,803 --> 00:23:50,721
I'm choosing not to or I can't.

370
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:55,685
I don't seem to be
gifted in relationships.

371
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:57,019
Unbelievable.

372
00:23:57,311 --> 00:24:00,064
People like you try to learn
about romance from books.

373
00:24:00,398 --> 00:24:02,733
Why must one be gifted
in order to like someone?

374
00:24:02,817 --> 00:24:04,110
If you like them, that's that.

375
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:07,905
If thinking of them puts a smile
on your face and you miss them

376
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:09,407
and want to be with them,

377
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:11,200
that's love.

378
00:24:13,411 --> 00:24:15,413
Let go of the fantasies you have about it.

379
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:17,081
It's not as grand as you think.

380
00:24:32,013 --> 00:24:34,307
Why must one be gifted
in order to like someone?

381
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:35,766
If you like them, that's that.

382
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:39,395
If thinking of them puts a smile
on your face and you miss them

383
00:24:39,604 --> 00:24:40,730
and wish to be with them,

384
00:24:41,564 --> 00:24:43,191
that's love.

385
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:54,535
Are you all right?

386
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:55,953
I'm fine.

387
00:24:56,037 --> 00:24:57,246
Goodness.

388
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:02,919
Have you been drinking again?

389
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:04,545
You smell like alcohol.

390
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:07,340
I didn't drink that much.

391
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:13,930
Think long and hard
about what she needs the most.

392
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:15,431
You'll find your answer.

393
00:25:17,058 --> 00:25:18,059
By the way...

394
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:23,356
So...

395
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:28,653
I'd like to propose something

396
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:31,614
that'll help you make up your mind.

397
00:25:32,073 --> 00:25:33,324
As in?

398
00:25:37,245 --> 00:25:38,829
For there to be a deal,

399
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:41,832
we must agree to the conditions.

400
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:46,712
I wasn't asking for your blood for free.

401
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:50,549
If you give me your blood full of love,

402
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:53,678
I will pay you back
in a way that is fitting.

403
00:25:53,761 --> 00:25:55,638
Really? How?

404
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:57,431
Well,

405
00:25:57,682 --> 00:26:01,686
I'm sure you want this as much as

406
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:04,313
I want to become human.

407
00:26:07,692 --> 00:26:08,859
Go ahead.

408
00:26:08,943 --> 00:26:10,486
What could I desperately want?

409
00:26:13,864 --> 00:26:14,865
I will...

410
00:26:16,284 --> 00:26:17,660
leave the mansion.

411
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:21,497
If you just give me
your blood that's full of love,

412
00:26:21,706 --> 00:26:24,792
the mansion will be entirely yours.

413
00:26:26,127 --> 00:26:28,337
What do you say? Does that intrigue you?

414
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:34,051
Do you mean that?

415
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:35,886
Of course.

416
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,888
Vampires never make empty promises.

417
00:26:37,972 --> 00:26:39,890
That's not what I mean.

418
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:44,645
Were you going to leave the mansion
after you drink my blood and become human?

419
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:46,022
Why?

420
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:47,940
Is there something wrong with that?

421
00:26:51,152 --> 00:26:51,986
I see.

422
00:26:52,987 --> 00:26:56,490
Of course I'm going to pay back
the money I owe you.

423
00:26:56,782 --> 00:27:00,077
I'm not one to just leave
without paying back what I owe,

424
00:27:00,161 --> 00:27:02,121
so you don't have to worry.

425
00:27:07,043 --> 00:27:08,210
So what do you say?

426
00:27:08,836 --> 00:27:09,920
Are you up for it?

427
00:27:16,719 --> 00:27:18,137
I've been wondering

428
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:20,056
what you'd give me in return for my blood.

429
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:23,225
So you'll move out of this house.

430
00:27:23,434 --> 00:27:24,435
Yes.

431
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:27,897
Okay, I hear you. Let me think it over.

432
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:30,775
What...

433
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:40,284
Did I do something wrong?

434
00:27:44,872 --> 00:27:46,165
We didn't break up.

435
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:48,167
She passed away a long time ago.

436
00:27:49,085 --> 00:27:50,086
And it was my fault.

437
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:52,171
It doesn't make any sense.

438
00:27:52,546 --> 00:27:55,049
Exactly. This doesn't make any sense.

439
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:56,926
What?

440
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,637
I thought you knew how much I like money.

441
00:28:00,137 --> 00:28:02,348
But is this all you're paying me?

442
00:28:03,391 --> 00:28:05,518
What I brought you
is worth way more than this.

443
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:09,355
The designer clothes you wear
and the car you drive.

444
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:11,315
Who paid for them?

445
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:12,525
Have you forgotten that?

446
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:14,777
This is a separate matter.

447
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:19,782
Do you not want to work with me?

448
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:21,283
I'm being professional.

449
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:23,577
I want a fair reward for my work.

450
00:28:24,161 --> 00:28:27,164
If that's too much for you,
we'll go our separate ways.

451
00:28:27,248 --> 00:28:29,125
- Are you done?
- I have more to say,

452
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:31,293
but I won't since I'm busy.

453
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,220
What are you looking at?

454
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:42,847
JOB OPENINGS

455
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:45,141
How about working the night shift
at a delivery service company?

456
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:46,475
Working nights will be good.

457
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:47,476
We'll ruin our health.

458
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,854
Is that worth it
when we can barely afford blood?

459
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:51,397
You think so?

460
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,107
Then what about a convenience store?

461
00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:56,819
Are you sure you can handle drunk people
making a scene at night?

462
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:00,114
All right.

463
00:29:00,698 --> 00:29:02,700
Then let's wash dishes at a restaurant.

464
00:29:02,783 --> 00:29:05,035
You expect me to wash dishes

465
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:06,787
with these soft and delicate hands?

466
00:29:07,163 --> 00:29:08,622
You don't want to do anything.

467
00:29:08,706 --> 00:29:10,249
Are you kidding me?

468
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:12,418
You must read the current trend

469
00:29:12,877 --> 00:29:14,962
even when it comes to part-time jobs.

470
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:16,547
Current trend, my ass.

471
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:17,882
Let's see.

472
00:29:17,965 --> 00:29:20,259
What's a job that's less exhausting

473
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:22,761
and pays a decent amount by the day?

474
00:29:23,888 --> 00:29:24,847
This is it!

475
00:29:36,317 --> 00:29:37,318
Do I look all right?

476
00:29:38,486 --> 00:29:40,237
This sure is fascinating.

477
00:29:40,571 --> 00:29:42,072
I have my emotions in control today.

478
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:45,576
Seop, background acting
is better than people think.

479
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:49,330
All you have to do is show reactions
that fit the scene.

480
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:50,706
And they pay good money too.

481
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:52,833
It's a sweet job for people like us.

482
00:29:55,419 --> 00:29:57,421
All right. Listen up, everyone.

483
00:29:58,214 --> 00:30:01,842
You'll sit here enjoying your noodles

484
00:30:01,926 --> 00:30:03,260
but run away

485
00:30:03,344 --> 00:30:06,013
as soon as the main character
enters the room, okay?

486
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:08,349
- Got it.
- Excuse me. Must I eat the jjajangmyeon?

487
00:30:08,432 --> 00:30:11,644
Eating your jjajangmyeon is the most
important element of this scene.

488
00:30:11,894 --> 00:30:14,897
You have to enjoy it
as best as you can. Got it?

489
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,273
Goodness.

490
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,108
What do we do?

491
00:30:18,192 --> 00:30:19,944
But we're ready to show emotions.

492
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:22,446
Enjoy it as best as you can.

493
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:27,826
GUKIL JUNGANG MEDICAL CENTER

494
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:32,748
It's good to have you back, sir.

495
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:34,833
Don't you have something to tell me?

496
00:30:36,377 --> 00:30:37,211
Right.

497
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:39,547
Actually, I was going to...

498
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:41,257
- Thank you.
- Sorry?

499
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:42,675
For calling her on my behalf.

500
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:46,220
No problem.

501
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:49,557
What about the thing I asked you?

502
00:30:52,476 --> 00:30:53,602
Here you go.

503
00:30:55,396 --> 00:30:57,439
There are a few people
in Seon Woo-hyeol's life

504
00:30:57,523 --> 00:30:59,191
who are a bit suspicious.

505
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:01,193
I'll need to further look into it.

506
00:31:05,406 --> 00:31:06,740
Should we head to the office?

507
00:31:07,575 --> 00:31:08,534
No.

508
00:31:09,285 --> 00:31:11,870
There's something I must do before that.

509
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:22,715
Hey.

510
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:25,509
This is a surprise.

511
00:31:25,843 --> 00:31:27,344
Why did you want to see me?

512
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:29,513
Are you feeling better?

513
00:31:29,847 --> 00:31:31,307
I'll ask point-blank.

514
00:31:32,725 --> 00:31:34,602
How long are you going to
stay at the guest house?

515
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,146
What do you mean by that?

516
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:38,981
I'm asking you to leave Shaded Oasis.

517
00:31:40,149 --> 00:31:42,234
It bothers and annoys me

518
00:31:42,318 --> 00:31:43,861
that you live with In-hae.

519
00:31:44,361 --> 00:31:45,821
How rude of you.

520
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,281
Who are you to tell me to leave?

521
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:49,491
If you don't have a place to stay,

522
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:51,702
I'll set you up.

523
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:53,912
I can also find you a job if you want.

524
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,627
Once I get what I want,

525
00:32:00,377 --> 00:32:03,589
I will leave the house of my own accord,
so do not worry.

526
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,136
And what is it that you want?

527
00:32:10,554 --> 00:32:11,722
I'll get you whatever you need.

528
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:15,684
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

529
00:32:17,061 --> 00:32:18,896
This conversation never happened.

530
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:38,040
SHADED OASIS GUEST HOUSE

531
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:39,541
RESERVATIONS: 0

532
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:45,005
MS. NA HAE-WON

533
00:32:48,217 --> 00:32:49,426
Hello, Ms. Na.

534
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:50,552
Ms. Joo,

535
00:32:50,636 --> 00:32:53,263
if you're free, could we meet up and talk?

536
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:54,848
Today?

537
00:32:58,102 --> 00:33:01,313
I asked to meet outside because I felt
I was visiting the guest house too often.

538
00:33:01,397 --> 00:33:02,439
I hope that's all right.

539
00:33:02,523 --> 00:33:03,357
It is.

540
00:33:04,066 --> 00:33:06,068
So how has it been
running the guest house?

541
00:33:07,027 --> 00:33:10,572
Actually, we're not getting as many guests
as I thought we would,

542
00:33:11,407 --> 00:33:12,616
so things haven't been easy.

543
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,618
But I'm going to try harder.

544
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:18,747
Simply trying harder
won't guarantee success.

545
00:33:19,832 --> 00:33:22,042
Not with all the guest houses
you can find in Seoul.

546
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:24,628
PR during the early stages is key
if you want to make a mark.

547
00:33:24,962 --> 00:33:26,797
Right, of course.

548
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:29,550
I actually have a good idea.

549
00:33:29,842 --> 00:33:31,260
Would you be open to helping me?

550
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:32,261
What do you mean?

551
00:33:32,553 --> 00:33:34,722
How about you throw a party
at Shaded Oasis?

552
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:36,724
A party?

553
00:33:36,807 --> 00:33:39,435
We'll invite random people
to the guest house

554
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:41,228
and let them enjoy a party together.

555
00:33:41,603 --> 00:33:44,189
If we make it a retro theme
and have everyone dress accordingly,

556
00:33:44,273 --> 00:33:46,191
I'm sure it'll blow up on social media.

557
00:33:46,692 --> 00:33:47,693
What do you think?

558
00:33:48,819 --> 00:33:51,280
It does sound like a good idea, but--

559
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:55,200
Right? Don't worry about expenses
and make it as grand as possible.

560
00:33:55,284 --> 00:33:56,285
You know what I mean, right?

561
00:33:59,163 --> 00:34:00,414
Your role is most important.

562
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,876
I want to get closer to Mr. Seon.

563
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:07,004
I'm planning to dress up for the party
and ask him out.

564
00:34:08,005 --> 00:34:09,173
Can I count on your help?

565
00:34:27,775 --> 00:34:29,860
Only your blood that is full of love

566
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:32,279
can turn me into a human being.

567
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:35,699
Hae-sun.

568
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:38,577
I want to get closer to Mr. Seon.

569
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:41,121
I'm planning to dress up for the party
and ask him out.

570
00:34:41,205 --> 00:34:42,289
Can I count on your help?

571
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:48,504
A party?

572
00:34:49,046 --> 00:34:53,258
Ms. Na suggested it
to promote the guest house.

573
00:34:53,634 --> 00:34:54,718
She did?

574
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:02,976
But why don't you seem excited?

575
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:06,021
It's like someone is forcing you to do it.

576
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,566
Throwing a party is a lot of work.

577
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:12,903
From preparing the food
to setting up the place...

578
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:16,198
I agreed with her on the spot, but...

579
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:17,699
Don't worry.

580
00:35:17,783 --> 00:35:19,993
I'm an expert when it comes to parties.

581
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:22,955
Allow me to work my magic.

582
00:35:23,497 --> 00:35:25,874
You can take care of it
if you're that confident then.

583
00:35:26,208 --> 00:35:27,626
I'll stay out of it.

584
00:35:48,272 --> 00:35:49,940
Once I get what I want,

585
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:53,777
I will leave the house of my own accord,
so do not worry.

586
00:35:58,699 --> 00:36:00,325
What is it that he wants?

587
00:36:07,124 --> 00:36:08,292
Hello, Ms. Na.

588
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:09,585
Are you feeling better?

589
00:36:11,879 --> 00:36:12,796
Right.

590
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,548
Yes, I am.

591
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:16,550
I appreciate your concern.

592
00:36:17,009 --> 00:36:18,010
That's a relief.

593
00:36:19,136 --> 00:36:22,055
Anyway, I called because there will be
a party at Shaded Oasis this weekend.

594
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:23,515
Can you make it?

595
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:24,725
A party?

596
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:26,435
It's to promote the guest house.

597
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:28,687
I thought it'd be fun
to throw a retro-themed party.

598
00:36:30,272 --> 00:36:31,607
Well, PR is important.

599
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:32,983
It is,

600
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,612
but I'm also hoping
to get closer to Mr. Seon.

601
00:36:37,154 --> 00:36:37,988
Sorry?

602
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:41,742
You should be more forward
with Ms. Joo that day as well.

603
00:36:42,242 --> 00:36:43,160
Who knows?

604
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:45,454
The event could serve
as a good opportunity.

605
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:47,331
Right.

606
00:36:47,414 --> 00:36:49,041
Anyway, dress nicely.

607
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:50,042
I'll see you then.

608
00:37:15,776 --> 00:37:18,111
Ms. Joo, how are the preparations
for the party coming along?

609
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:33,001
This is a horrendous color.

610
00:37:34,378 --> 00:37:36,964
Is this one supposed to
look like a carrot or what?

611
00:37:38,048 --> 00:37:39,383
Goodness me.

612
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:41,927
This...

613
00:37:42,844 --> 00:37:45,347
used to be one of my favorites,
but it's worn out.

614
00:37:50,352 --> 00:37:52,729
What you wear to a party
is of utmost importance.

615
00:37:53,563 --> 00:37:55,732
I can't show up in these.

616
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:01,780
Osio Rasa.

617
00:38:02,364 --> 00:38:05,617
That's right. I'll get myself
a brand-new custom suit.

618
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:14,918
Welcome.

619
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:18,088
Mr. Ox Blood, what brings you by?

620
00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:21,591
I'm in need of something
to wear this weekend.

621
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,844
Would it be possible
to get it custom-made by then?

622
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:25,303
- This weekend?
- Yes.

623
00:38:25,929 --> 00:38:28,932
I'll take your measurements
for a new custom suit,

624
00:38:29,016 --> 00:38:31,226
but for this weekend,
I'll lend you something I have.

625
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,770
- What's your name?
- It's Seon Woo-hyeol.

626
00:38:34,021 --> 00:38:35,272
Seon what?

627
00:38:35,522 --> 00:38:36,732
Seon Woo-hyeol.

628
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:39,026
- Seon Woo-hyeol?
- Yes.

629
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:42,154
That's a rare name you have.
Mr. Seon Woo-hyeol.

630
00:38:43,405 --> 00:38:44,489
Hold on.

631
00:38:44,573 --> 00:38:45,490
Seon Woo-hyeol?

632
00:38:46,283 --> 00:38:48,660
Your name is Seon Woo-hyeol?

633
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,078
Yes.

634
00:38:56,543 --> 00:39:00,297
Here is the custom suit that was made
to the measurements you provided.

635
00:39:06,887 --> 00:39:07,846
This is incredible.

636
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,097
Thank you.

637
00:39:10,057 --> 00:39:11,975
This will be a great gift.

638
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:14,561
Oh, it must be for someone else.

639
00:39:15,312 --> 00:39:16,313
However,

640
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,816
it may take a while for him to pick it up.

641
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:22,069
Could you keep it here until then?

642
00:39:22,152 --> 00:39:23,153
Sure thing.

643
00:39:23,236 --> 00:39:24,404
I can do that.

644
00:39:28,909 --> 00:39:32,329
Then he said I should give this suit
to a man named Seon Woo-hyeol

645
00:39:32,412 --> 00:39:34,206
should he ever visit.

646
00:39:34,456 --> 00:39:36,166
Try it on and see if it fits.

647
00:39:38,335 --> 00:39:39,461
That man

648
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,756
used to come by now and then
to pay for storing the suit,

649
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:44,883
but I haven't seen him in a while.

650
00:39:45,342 --> 00:39:48,386
I couldn't throw it out
since someone could claim it one day,

651
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:50,388
so it was left in storage.

652
00:39:50,472 --> 00:39:52,974
Finally, the gift has been claimed
by its owner.

653
00:39:54,309 --> 00:39:57,687
Do you know who asked you
to keep this suit here?

654
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:01,483
I'm not sure. He never told me his name.

655
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,361
That reminds me.

656
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:08,990
He said you would know
if I told you he managed the old mansion.

657
00:40:15,497 --> 00:40:18,333
So Butler Joo's father who went missing

658
00:40:18,667 --> 00:40:21,002
had the store keep this suit for you?

659
00:40:21,086 --> 00:40:22,838
- Yes.
- Are there suits for us too?

660
00:40:25,382 --> 00:40:27,759
Would it have killed him
to get us new suits as well?

661
00:40:27,843 --> 00:40:29,052
That brat.

662
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:32,889
He used to come by regularly
to pay the storage fee

663
00:40:33,473 --> 00:40:35,725
but suddenly stopped coming by.

664
00:40:35,809 --> 00:40:38,436
It could mean
that something happened to him.

665
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:39,855
He probably

666
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:42,858
found the gold and took off with it.

667
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:44,192
No way.

668
00:40:44,818 --> 00:40:46,611
That doesn't sound like someone

669
00:40:46,695 --> 00:40:48,613
who was thoughtful enough to have a suit
made in advance for me.

670
00:40:48,697 --> 00:40:50,490
I'm sure something
must've happened to him.

671
00:40:50,574 --> 00:40:52,868
Does Butler Joo not know anything?

672
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:55,537
Right. I should go talk to her and...

673
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:57,539
Why did you come here anyway?

674
00:40:57,622 --> 00:40:59,166
Did you come to flaunt your new suit?

675
00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:00,709
Right.

676
00:41:01,293 --> 00:41:03,295
I have a favor to ask.

677
00:41:04,546 --> 00:41:07,174
There will be a party
at Shaded Oasis this weekend.

678
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:08,717
- A party?
- A party?

679
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,845
Dance, music, alcohol, and romance.

680
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:14,306
Just like Shaded Oasis
from back in the day,

681
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:16,433
there's no better place
for love to blossom.

682
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:20,312
I'm planning on making Butler Joo

683
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:21,938
the main focus of the party.

684
00:41:24,608 --> 00:41:27,694
This will be more than enough
for over 30 people.

685
00:41:29,196 --> 00:41:30,614
Right, I'll take it.

686
00:41:30,906 --> 00:41:31,865
All of it?

687
00:41:34,201 --> 00:41:35,035
This is new.

688
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:37,287
All you ever buy is ox blood.

689
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:41,166
We're having a party
at the guest house this weekend.

690
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:44,127
If you're free, you should come by.

691
00:41:45,253 --> 00:41:48,131
I don't want to spoil the fun
for youngsters.

692
00:41:48,215 --> 00:41:50,884
Just make sure
you don't make noises late at night.

693
00:41:50,967 --> 00:41:53,220
Okay. We won't be a nuisance.

694
00:41:53,762 --> 00:41:54,721
I'll give you some extra.

695
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:56,556
Thank you.

696
00:42:09,319 --> 00:42:11,071
You should've asked me to join you.

697
00:42:12,405 --> 00:42:13,448
Why carry these yourself?

698
00:42:14,574 --> 00:42:16,243
You were nowhere to be seen.

699
00:42:17,827 --> 00:42:18,954
What's that?

700
00:42:19,496 --> 00:42:20,664
Is that a suit?

701
00:42:22,791 --> 00:42:23,792
Don't tell me...

702
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:26,878
It's not like that. This was a gift.

703
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:29,214
A gift from whom? Ms. Na?

704
00:42:32,384 --> 00:42:34,427
What? What is it?

705
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:36,137
Who was it from?

706
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,685
Are you really not going to tell me?

707
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,896
Are you that curious?

708
00:42:45,772 --> 00:42:49,317
Well, you returned home
with an unexpected gift.

709
00:42:52,946 --> 00:42:53,780
Your father.

710
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,157
What?

711
00:42:59,286 --> 00:43:02,747
Your father had this custom-made for me.

712
00:43:03,957 --> 00:43:05,250
My dad?

713
00:43:11,965 --> 00:43:14,467
OSIO TAILOR SHOP

714
00:43:33,737 --> 00:43:36,656
Apparently, he ordered it
about four to five years ago.

715
00:43:37,532 --> 00:43:39,492
Does it give you any clues?

716
00:43:41,745 --> 00:43:42,829
Not at all.

717
00:43:44,164 --> 00:43:47,000
I even passed out flyers and whatnot
to find him,

718
00:43:48,418 --> 00:43:49,711
but it was all in vain.

719
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:53,923
I worried about him and then resented him.

720
00:43:55,425 --> 00:43:57,761
But now I feel nothing toward him.

721
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:04,934
Haven't you thought of the possibility
of him being alive?

722
00:44:08,438 --> 00:44:11,358
One day, it just hit me

723
00:44:12,359 --> 00:44:15,737
that if my father were alive,

724
00:44:16,905 --> 00:44:18,990
he might not want to be found.

725
00:44:20,116 --> 00:44:21,910
Maybe he wanted to move on

726
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:24,704
erasing the memories of me and my mom.

727
00:44:26,956 --> 00:44:30,585
He never showed up
during my mom's final days.

728
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:33,004
Maybe something kept him from showing up.

729
00:44:55,735 --> 00:44:56,778
DO-SIK

730
00:45:03,743 --> 00:45:06,496
In-hae, I heard there's going to be
a party at Shaded Oasis tomorrow.

731
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:08,373
Ms. Na called.

732
00:45:08,581 --> 00:45:10,291
Gosh, I totally forgot.

733
00:45:13,086 --> 00:45:15,213
I was actually going to call you.

734
00:45:15,505 --> 00:45:17,257
How are you feeling?

735
00:45:18,633 --> 00:45:20,510
Thanks to you, I'm recovered now.

736
00:45:21,177 --> 00:45:22,429
I appreciate your concern.

737
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:24,681
Don't overexert yourself.

738
00:45:24,764 --> 00:45:26,850
And drop by the party
if you're feeling all right.

739
00:45:27,767 --> 00:45:29,102
All right, see you tomorrow.

740
00:46:05,054 --> 00:46:07,390
This is going to take us forever.

741
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:10,185
We need to set the tables
and prepare the food.

742
00:46:10,268 --> 00:46:11,769
There's so much to do.

743
00:46:11,853 --> 00:46:14,105
That's why I called for help in advance.

744
00:46:14,481 --> 00:46:15,523
What?

745
00:46:19,068 --> 00:46:20,737
- Woo-hyeol.
- Woo-hyeol.

746
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:21,654
Wait.

747
00:46:22,238 --> 00:46:23,281
You people...

748
00:46:29,037 --> 00:46:30,079
We meet again.

749
00:46:31,372 --> 00:46:32,749
They won't bite.

750
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:36,753
We can't possibly
have a party without them,

751
00:46:37,086 --> 00:46:38,046
so I called them over.

752
00:46:38,379 --> 00:46:41,132
We were short-handed,
so they'll be of good use.

753
00:46:41,633 --> 00:46:43,718
Hi, we haven't met before.

754
00:46:44,052 --> 00:46:45,428
I'm Rose.

755
00:46:46,513 --> 00:46:48,765
We're only here for Woo-hyeol,
so don't get any ideas.

756
00:46:49,557 --> 00:46:51,434
There's a lot to do, so let's get to it.

757
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:54,938
Excuse us then.

758
00:46:59,734 --> 00:47:01,361
You should've talked to me about this.

759
00:47:01,444 --> 00:47:03,530
Would you have allowed it if I had?

760
00:47:04,239 --> 00:47:06,908
It's better to ask for forgiveness
than permission.

761
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:07,992
What?

762
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:09,869
I apologize.

763
00:47:12,539 --> 00:47:13,498
Let's get to work!

764
00:47:15,291 --> 00:47:16,334
One, two, three.

765
00:47:19,337 --> 00:47:20,505
Do humans do this all the time?

766
00:47:20,588 --> 00:47:22,215
- Why is this...
- My goodness.

767
00:47:30,974 --> 00:47:32,392
Have you thrown a party here before?

768
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:34,269
What? No.

769
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:36,396
There's nothing much to it.

770
00:47:36,479 --> 00:47:38,815
Just prepare food
for about 100 people and...

771
00:47:40,149 --> 00:47:41,359
Did you say 100 people?

772
00:47:43,653 --> 00:47:45,154
That's the bare minimum.

773
00:47:45,238 --> 00:47:47,198
But I bought meat
enough for only 30 people.

774
00:47:47,991 --> 00:47:49,325
This is so heavy.

775
00:47:49,409 --> 00:47:50,994
You've got to hand it to humans.

776
00:47:54,539 --> 00:47:56,916
SHADED OASIS

777
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,459
I can't believe you still had this.

778
00:48:02,338 --> 00:48:03,548
It reminds me of old times.

779
00:48:04,674 --> 00:48:07,468
It feels different
to see it after 100 years.

780
00:48:07,802 --> 00:48:08,970
Those were the good days.

781
00:48:09,304 --> 00:48:10,346
Don't you agree, Woo-hyeol?

782
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:13,725
I'm doing pretty well now too.

783
00:48:14,225 --> 00:48:15,852
I still have you guys, don't I?

784
00:48:18,313 --> 00:48:19,606
And a good day like this

785
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:22,692
wouldn't be complete without some music.

786
00:48:23,067 --> 00:48:24,777
- Turn it up.
- Here comes the music.

787
00:48:25,945 --> 00:48:26,863
Yes!

788
00:48:32,201 --> 00:48:33,620
Rose, bring it on.

789
00:48:47,258 --> 00:48:49,802
He said I should give this suit
to a man named Seon Woo-hyeol

790
00:48:49,886 --> 00:48:51,596
should he ever visit.

791
00:49:08,529 --> 00:49:09,739
What are these?

792
00:49:10,365 --> 00:49:11,991
Did you forget about the dress code?

793
00:49:12,241 --> 00:49:13,618
Rules are rules.

794
00:49:14,577 --> 00:49:16,996
You can't only look good yourself.

795
00:49:17,622 --> 00:49:19,499
What about her?

796
00:49:19,832 --> 00:49:21,459
Don't just stand there.
Go give these to her.

797
00:49:22,377 --> 00:49:24,170
- Go on.
- All right.

798
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:33,930
Here.

799
00:49:34,889 --> 00:49:36,516
What are these?

800
00:49:37,392 --> 00:49:39,310
The attire is what completes a party.

801
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,854
Let's dress up today and have fun.

802
00:49:44,357 --> 00:49:45,441
Thank you.

803
00:49:46,359 --> 00:49:48,486
Rose is the one you should thank.

804
00:49:49,112 --> 00:49:51,197
I just delivered it.

805
00:49:51,781 --> 00:49:54,033
I was thanking you for what you just said.

806
00:49:55,576 --> 00:50:00,498
I think you're the first person
to ever tell me to have a good time.

807
00:50:03,042 --> 00:50:04,377
That's nothing to be grateful for.

808
00:50:06,796 --> 00:50:07,714
Get changed then.

809
00:50:09,132 --> 00:50:11,259
Can I ask you something?

810
00:50:14,429 --> 00:50:17,557
Why do you want to be in love?

811
00:50:18,266 --> 00:50:21,644
What's so special about love
that makes your heart beat?

812
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:27,316
Someone once said,

813
00:50:28,985 --> 00:50:30,570
"Just like how you only have one heart,

814
00:50:31,904 --> 00:50:33,114
you can only truly love one person."

815
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:36,617
One true love.

816
00:50:37,535 --> 00:50:39,287
Only loving one person...

817
00:50:40,913 --> 00:50:43,708
until my heart finally stops beating.

818
00:50:46,919 --> 00:50:49,255
I simply want to experience
that kind of love.

819
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:52,216
That's all.

820
00:51:09,525 --> 00:51:11,694
I don't feel like myself.

821
00:51:29,879 --> 00:51:30,922
Why are you grinning?

822
00:51:31,756 --> 00:51:32,715
Does it not suit me?

823
00:51:38,596 --> 00:51:41,474
You look better in vintage clothes
than you do in modern-day clothes.

824
00:51:42,183 --> 00:51:43,309
What's that supposed to mean?

825
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:45,353
Is that a compliment?

826
00:51:45,686 --> 00:51:46,646
You look pretty.

827
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:48,105
The dress suits you.

828
00:51:53,694 --> 00:51:54,737
Shall we?

829
00:52:03,371 --> 00:52:05,289
SHADED OASIS GUEST HOUSE

830
00:52:05,915 --> 00:52:07,458
This is totally new to me.

831
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:10,545
Come on in, everyone!

832
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:14,090
- We're heading in.
- What's that?

833
00:52:14,423 --> 00:52:15,883
Here you go. All good.

834
00:52:16,717 --> 00:52:19,011
I used to have a suit just like yours.

835
00:52:19,262 --> 00:52:20,930
Right, head on in.

836
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:22,306
Next.

837
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:25,810
Here you go. Have a good time.

838
00:52:25,893 --> 00:52:27,436
- Sure.
- This is crazy.

839
00:52:32,316 --> 00:52:34,110
I didn't expect a huge turnout like this.

840
00:52:34,193 --> 00:52:35,736
The event is an utter success.

841
00:52:36,237 --> 00:52:37,196
Tell me about it.

842
00:52:38,447 --> 00:52:39,448
Mr. Seon.

843
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,420
Welcome to Shaded Oasis.

844
00:52:56,007 --> 00:52:56,966
How do I look?

845
00:52:59,427 --> 00:53:01,012
You look like a beautiful flower.

846
00:53:02,305 --> 00:53:04,765
Thank you for suggesting
the party, Ms. Na.

847
00:53:04,849 --> 00:53:06,142
There's no need to thank me.

848
00:53:13,399 --> 00:53:14,483
Ms. Joo.

849
00:53:16,152 --> 00:53:18,195
You did a great job
putting the party together.

850
00:53:19,989 --> 00:53:21,115
You know what to do, right?

851
00:53:21,616 --> 00:53:22,450
I'm counting on you.

852
00:53:27,538 --> 00:53:30,625
Woo-hyeol, let's take photos over there.

853
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:32,376
Sure. Let's do that.

854
00:53:46,557 --> 00:53:47,516
In-hae.

855
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,435
Hi, Do-sik.

856
00:53:50,519 --> 00:53:52,688
I don't think I've ever seen you
like this before. It suits you.

857
00:53:53,439 --> 00:53:54,899
You look great as well.

858
00:53:56,025 --> 00:53:57,568
Wait here for a second.

859
00:53:57,652 --> 00:53:59,028
I'll get you a drink.

860
00:53:59,278 --> 00:54:00,196
Okay.

861
00:54:03,574 --> 00:54:04,659
Here.

862
00:54:04,742 --> 00:54:05,952
Enjoy your party.

863
00:54:53,499 --> 00:54:54,792
- Here!
- Hey.

864
00:54:55,209 --> 00:54:56,711
- Thank you.
- Please enjoy.

865
00:54:56,794 --> 00:54:58,004
Thank you.

866
00:55:06,178 --> 00:55:07,179
Are you okay?

867
00:55:11,225 --> 00:55:12,143
Yes.

868
00:55:18,524 --> 00:55:19,817
You seem to have had a lot.

869
00:55:20,026 --> 00:55:22,236
It's all right.
Although it's getting a little hot.

870
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:23,904
Would you like some more?

871
00:55:23,988 --> 00:55:25,406
- I'd like that. Thanks.
- All right.

872
00:55:53,392 --> 00:55:54,393
Jackpot.

873
00:55:54,477 --> 00:55:55,352
Here, Rose.

874
00:55:55,561 --> 00:55:56,645
Sang-hae, here.

875
00:55:56,729 --> 00:55:57,772
Sang-hae.

876
00:55:57,855 --> 00:55:58,773
Cheers!

877
00:56:06,072 --> 00:56:07,490
Hey, there. Let's drink.

878
00:56:07,573 --> 00:56:08,532
Sorry?

879
00:56:08,616 --> 00:56:09,533
Oh, right.

880
00:56:10,034 --> 00:56:11,869
- Here you go.
- Right.

881
00:56:19,085 --> 00:56:21,337
- Can I get a glass of that wine?
- Sorry?

882
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:24,465
What's with this wine?
It must've gone bad.

883
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:27,468
No wonder.

884
00:56:27,551 --> 00:56:29,887
- Sorry about that.
- But this is also fine liquor.

885
00:56:30,346 --> 00:56:31,639
Can I serve you this instead?

886
00:56:49,824 --> 00:56:50,783
What are you doing?

887
00:56:53,577 --> 00:56:55,496
I was getting some fresh air.

888
00:56:57,248 --> 00:56:59,125
Weren't you enjoying the party?

889
00:56:59,208 --> 00:57:01,544
I came out for some fresh air as well.

890
00:57:04,755 --> 00:57:07,091
You're impressive, Woo-hyeol.

891
00:57:08,259 --> 00:57:09,093
What do you mean?

892
00:57:09,176 --> 00:57:12,012
You did everything for love.

893
00:57:13,889 --> 00:57:15,474
You built this mansion

894
00:57:15,933 --> 00:57:17,309
and have been hosting parties.

895
00:57:18,269 --> 00:57:20,980
I admire that about you.

896
00:57:24,108 --> 00:57:25,651
You just realized that now?

897
00:57:27,653 --> 00:57:29,572
It's impossible to compliment you.

898
00:57:30,281 --> 00:57:33,868
Ever since I met you at this mansion,

899
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:36,203
my life has seen more joy.

900
00:57:38,289 --> 00:57:41,250
It's like my dad
brought me here to meet you.

901
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:46,964
I like this mansion.

902
00:57:48,924 --> 00:57:50,009
Actually,

903
00:57:50,551 --> 00:57:52,845
I like this place because you're here.

904
00:57:56,307 --> 00:57:58,726
So reconsider the terms of our deal.

905
00:57:59,685 --> 00:58:01,979
Offer something else
that doesn't involve you leaving.

906
00:58:15,951 --> 00:58:17,620
- Ms. Joo!
- Ms. Joo!

907
00:58:17,870 --> 00:58:19,580
- Ms. Joo!
- Ms. Joo!

908
00:58:19,872 --> 00:58:21,457
- Ms. Joo!
- Ms. Joo!

909
00:58:21,916 --> 00:58:23,459
- Ms. Joo!
- Ms. Joo!

910
00:58:23,542 --> 00:58:25,544
- Ms. Joo!
- Ms. Joo!

911
00:58:25,878 --> 00:58:27,421
- Ms. Joo!
- They're asking for you.

912
00:58:28,214 --> 00:58:29,965
- Ms. Joo!
- Ms. Joo!

913
00:58:30,049 --> 00:58:31,675
- Ms. Joo!
- Ms. Joo!

914
00:58:32,551 --> 00:58:34,220
Woo-hyeol, behind you.

915
00:58:34,303 --> 00:58:37,389
- Ms. Joo!
- Ms. Joo!

916
00:58:37,806 --> 00:58:39,808
- Ms. Joo!
- Let's go.

917
00:58:39,892 --> 00:58:41,310
- Ms. Joo!
- Ms. Joo!

918
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:50,986
What are you doing?

919
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:54,490
You can't ruin the mood
when they're calling out for you.

920
00:58:54,990 --> 00:58:56,867
But this is too sudden.

921
00:58:58,369 --> 00:58:59,703
Just follow my lead.

922
00:59:46,709 --> 00:59:49,295
I don't think
I've ever seen him dance before.

923
00:59:49,503 --> 00:59:50,546
Tell me about it.

924
00:59:50,796 --> 00:59:52,798
I've seen him surrounded by women before,

925
00:59:52,881 --> 00:59:54,883
but never have I seen him
dancing with one.

926
00:59:55,092 --> 00:59:56,635
He's so hot.

927
01:00:17,823 --> 01:00:19,742
- Seon Woo-hyeol is my name.
- Joo In-hae.

928
01:00:19,825 --> 01:00:21,744
You avoid poop because it stinks,
not because it's scary.

929
01:00:21,827 --> 01:00:23,245
What a rowdy young lady.

930
01:00:23,454 --> 01:00:25,914
My day has been hard enough
because of you.

931
01:00:28,167 --> 01:00:30,336
Let's go home.

932
01:00:40,929 --> 01:00:43,640
I don't know what more I can do now.

933
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:49,104
I like this place because you're here.

934
01:01:06,455 --> 01:01:08,415
Looks like things are
going to get complicated.

935
01:01:40,989 --> 01:01:42,032
I also...

936
01:01:43,033 --> 01:01:44,660
like this mansion because you're here.

937
01:02:20,654 --> 01:02:23,574
HEARTBEAT

938
01:02:23,657 --> 01:02:26,034
Is there anything you know
about the mansion?

939
01:02:26,118 --> 01:02:28,495
But I don't think
I've seen him ever since.

940
01:02:28,579 --> 01:02:30,914
I have a bad feeling about this.

941
01:02:30,998 --> 01:02:33,041
You have feelings for Mr. Seon, don't you?

942
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:36,170
You guys were on fire
on the dance floor last night.

943
01:02:36,253 --> 01:02:37,379
I smell love in the air.

944
01:02:37,838 --> 01:02:40,048
He's not a man
who's as dangerous as you think he is.

945
01:02:40,132 --> 01:02:41,216
A "man"?

946
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:44,845
It might be a good idea
to hire a vampire who can give us intel.

947
01:02:44,928 --> 01:02:47,764
You're the reason Hae-sun died?

948
01:02:47,848 --> 01:02:49,600
You said you missed me.

949
01:02:49,683 --> 01:02:50,809
Don't go.

950
01:02:51,393 --> 01:02:53,896
Then all we have to do
is kick Joo In-hae out.

951
01:02:54,271 --> 01:02:57,107
I think I have feelings for you,
Woo-hyeol.

952
01:02:57,191 --> 01:02:59,276
Woo-hyeol!

953
