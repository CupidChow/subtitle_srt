00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:45,296
HEARTBEAT

2
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,298
ALL CHARACTERS, NAMES,
ORGANIZATIONS, GROUPS, EVENTS,

3
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,383
AND SETTINGS ARE FICTITIOUS
AND ANIMAL SAFETY GUIDELINES WERE FOLLOWED

4
00:00:54,472 --> 00:00:55,473
Hae-sun.

5
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:02,396
It's you, right?

6
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:11,155
What is this about?

7
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:12,615
What on earth are you saying?

8
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,367
Were you dreaming?

9
00:01:24,043 --> 00:01:25,044
Hae-sun.

10
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:39,058
Don't get cute with me!

11
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:40,893
My eyes!

12
00:01:42,228 --> 00:01:43,354
"Capsaicin"?

13
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:46,273
I guess it works on vampires too.

14
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:54,031
This is amazing.

15
00:01:59,662 --> 00:02:03,499
HEARTBEAT
EPISODE 5

16
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:18,889
You approached me all of a sudden,
so I got scared.

17
00:02:19,932 --> 00:02:21,100
I'm sorry.

18
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:30,359
Will you make me shed tears of blood
next time I scare you?

19
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:36,782
So tell me.

20
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:40,327
Why did you knock on my door at this hour?

21
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:42,413
You better have a good reason.

22
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:48,836
It's quite a tear-jerking story.

23
00:02:49,712 --> 00:02:50,796
Are you ready?

24
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:01,390
Long ago,

25
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:04,935
there was a woman

26
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:06,979
who sacrificed herself to save me.

27
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:11,150
Is her name

28
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:12,526
Hae-sun?

29
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:17,281
But why did you call me by her name?

30
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,867
Do we look alike?

31
00:03:20,451 --> 00:03:22,202
No, not at all!

32
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:23,329
Not one bit.

33
00:03:24,622 --> 00:03:25,623
What the heck?

34
00:03:33,339 --> 00:03:35,257
Before Hae-sun died, she said

35
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:37,468
that she'd come find me

36
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:40,763
and we'd love each other
with all our hearts.

37
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,475
That's why I wanted to become human.

38
00:03:46,602 --> 00:03:48,145
I wanted to experience love

39
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:51,190
that makes my heart beat with her.

40
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:56,487
So when you opened my coffin

41
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,030
with a day left until 100 years,

42
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:00,783
it made my blood boil.

43
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,702
I'm sorry about that.

44
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:07,623
It wasn't intentional,

45
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:08,874
but because of me--

46
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:11,210
Yes, it was all you.

47
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:18,342
I think the coffin opened

48
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:21,095
because it was you.

49
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:23,514
What do you mean?

50
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:25,683
For a moment,

51
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:29,478
I thought you could be Hae-sun.

52
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:32,731
Me?

53
00:04:33,691 --> 00:04:34,775
Me?

54
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:39,446
That would explain

55
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:42,408
why you were able to open the coffin

56
00:04:42,992 --> 00:04:45,744
and why I was able to know
every time you were in danger.

57
00:04:45,828 --> 00:04:47,538
You're delusional.

58
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,748
You said I was your butler's descendant,

59
00:04:49,832 --> 00:04:51,709
and now I used to be your lover
in my former life?

60
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:54,545
I died trying to protect you?

61
00:04:57,756 --> 00:05:00,467
Don't look at me like that.
It makes me uncomfortable.

62
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:03,554
If she and I don't even look alike,
what gave you that idea?

63
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:07,182
The other day...

64
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:11,603
when I tasted a drop of your blood
from your lips,

65
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:15,399
I felt Hae-sun.

66
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:17,151
Are you talking about

67
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:21,905
past lives, reincarnation,
and whatnot right now?

68
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:22,948
Are you serious?

69
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,826
- Yes.
- Don't be ridiculous!

70
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:27,494
You must be kidding me.

71
00:05:27,578 --> 00:05:30,497
My current life is exhausting as is,
so stop yapping about my former life.

72
00:05:31,582 --> 00:05:34,585
And even if I were that woman,

73
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:37,880
shouldn't you let me live my life
if I died for you in my former life?

74
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:41,800
You've been following me around
for multiple lifetimes.

75
00:05:41,884 --> 00:05:43,761
That's considered a crime these days.

76
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:45,054
It's called stalking.

77
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:46,972
"Stalking"?

78
00:05:47,056 --> 00:05:48,807
Yes, stalking.

79
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:51,477
What you're doing isn't love.
It's obsession.

80
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,936
It's an illness.

81
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:56,899
How could you obsess over
one person for centuries?

82
00:05:57,483 --> 00:05:58,859
That's so creepy.

83
00:05:58,942 --> 00:05:59,818
"Creepy"?

84
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:05,866
All right.

85
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:07,951
As long as you really are Hae-sun,

86
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,788
I can put up with anything you say to me.

87
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:14,374
- You're Hae-sun, right?
- Stop! I told you I'm not!

88
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,294
Past lives? I couldn't care less.

89
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,046
Reincarnation? It appalls me.

90
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:22,841
I'll consider this life
my first and last one,

91
00:06:23,092 --> 00:06:24,802
so don't drag me into your nonsense!

92
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:26,386
- Hae...
- My gosh.

93
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,194
Me?

94
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:58,377
I can't believe she said that.

95
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:01,630
I didn't see that coming.

96
00:07:02,506 --> 00:07:03,924
If she meant what she said,

97
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,094
there's no point in me becoming human.

98
00:07:07,386 --> 00:07:08,762
She wants to be free.

99
00:07:12,558 --> 00:07:13,809
Let her go.

100
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:15,769
There are many women out there.

101
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:19,106
But none of them like me.

102
00:07:19,982 --> 00:07:21,483
I beg to differ.

103
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:24,778
You don't know anything for sure yet.

104
00:07:25,404 --> 00:07:28,157
She may not be the woman
who you've been waiting for.

105
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:31,201
- What?
- You said from their conduct to looks,

106
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:33,328
they couldn't be more different.

107
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:35,789
And most importantly,

108
00:07:35,873 --> 00:07:38,917
her blood is extremely poisonous.

109
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:41,378
But the woman you're waiting for
wouldn't have such blood.

110
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:43,213
You're right.

111
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:46,884
To become human, you need to drink
her blood after she falls in love.

112
00:07:47,718 --> 00:07:49,845
So focus on achieving that goal first.

113
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:52,639
All right.

114
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:54,850
You're right.

115
00:07:56,727 --> 00:07:57,811
But...

116
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:02,107
- could I get her to fall in love?
- Sorry?

117
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:06,820
I don't see the problem here.
Just make her fall for you.

118
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:08,739
- Fall for me?
- You're the mighty Seon Woo-hyeol.

119
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,657
You're not one to worry about women.

120
00:08:10,741 --> 00:08:12,117
He's right.

121
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:14,828
You used to make women shed
quite some tears. What's gotten into you?

122
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:21,960
This time, she made me cry.

123
00:08:22,044 --> 00:08:23,086
Sorry?

124
00:08:24,588 --> 00:08:26,173
Oh, it's nothing.

125
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:27,799
Never mind.

126
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:32,012
But...

127
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:34,473
to be honest, I feel a little hurt.

128
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:35,432
Why?

129
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,516
You never told us

130
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,769
why you wanted to become human
when we asked.

131
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,395
But you already told her everything.

132
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,941
We go back centuries
while you only just met her.

133
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:46,526
Does our friendship
mean that little to you?

134
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:48,487
Does it?

135
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:54,368
I'm sorry.

136
00:08:55,244 --> 00:08:58,372
I didn't want to show you guys
that side of me.

137
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:02,251
And it's also a painful memory for me.

138
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:08,173
You wouldn't have understood if I told you
that I wanted to become human

139
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:11,051
to experience love
that makes my heart beat.

140
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:12,844
Woo-hyeol.

141
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:14,304
Hey, why would you...

142
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:16,139
This is why

143
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:18,684
I like Woo-hyeol.

144
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:19,726
What?

145
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:22,145
He's tall, handsome, and fashionable.

146
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:23,438
He's too good to be true.

147
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:26,191
But there's always
this lingering sadness about him.

148
00:09:26,692 --> 00:09:29,653
It makes me want to embrace him.

149
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,321
- Don't you agree?
- I do.

150
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:33,991
He couldn't be manlier on the outside,

151
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:37,119
but he's all soft and warm on the inside

152
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:38,495
like soft tofu.

153
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:42,874
You always seem to make food analogies.

154
00:09:45,711 --> 00:09:47,337
Thank you for understanding.

155
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:50,048
I don't know
if I should be saying this, but--

156
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:51,925
There you go again. Don't say it.

157
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:54,428
One, two, three. I think I should.

158
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,055
This lady named Hae-sun...

159
00:09:57,139 --> 00:09:58,223
Is she pretty?

160
00:09:58,307 --> 00:10:00,309
If you have a photo of her,
can I take a look?

161
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:03,061
Hold on. She's too old
for there to be any photos of her.

162
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:06,648
How about a drawing?

163
00:10:06,982 --> 00:10:08,567
This is why I can never trust you.

164
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:11,361
- What's wrong with being curious?
- Stop it.

165
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:13,864
Anyway Woo-hyeol, don't worry too much.

166
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,491
- We'll try our best to help.
- We will.

167
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,327
Thanks, guys.

168
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:22,122
Bring it in!

169
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:24,166
- We can do this!
- Let's do this!

170
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,254
We can do this, Woo-hyeol.

171
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:34,051
I didn't expect you
to pick me up yourself.

172
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:35,344
I'm touched.

173
00:10:37,346 --> 00:10:39,181
Then my plan worked.

174
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:41,641
Thank you. I know you're busy.

175
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:44,311
I can always make time for you.

176
00:10:46,605 --> 00:10:49,107
But what brings you to Korea
all of a sudden?

177
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:52,402
There's an old mansion that I once saw.

178
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:53,987
And I keep thinking about it.

179
00:10:54,363 --> 00:10:55,697
As if it belonged to me.

180
00:10:55,781 --> 00:10:58,116
I'd love to know more
about your new obsession.

181
00:10:59,785 --> 00:11:01,745
It's in Gongcheon-dong.

182
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:04,164
Gongcheon-dong?

183
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,291
Are you familiar with that area?

184
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,669
Well, I've been there a few times.

185
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,048
That's why I came to Korea.

186
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:15,467
I can't seem to get it off my mind.

187
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:24,453
I told you not to move.

188
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:41,970
I don't want to.

189
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:44,806
- You ask her.
- What's wrong with you?

190
00:12:45,307 --> 00:12:47,100
- Hurry up.
- Come on.

191
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:48,727
Go and ask her.

192
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:50,353
- Please.
- Stop it.

193
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,274
What do you want to ask me?

194
00:12:56,318 --> 00:12:57,277
Ask away.

195
00:12:57,569 --> 00:12:58,487
You ask her.

196
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:02,741
If you need to talk in private,
you can come to my office later.

197
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,579
Are you dating the handsome custodian?

198
00:13:08,163 --> 00:13:10,207
- What?
- There are rumors going on

199
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,541
that the two of you are dating.

200
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:14,002
Who said that?

201
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:15,879
- Is it true?
- It's not, right?

202
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:19,049
- No, it's not true at all.
- Is it?

203
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,592
- Ms. Joo, wait!
- Wait up!

204
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:23,220
- Wait!
- Tell us!

205
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:29,559
Excuse me.

206
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:32,896
This is for you.

207
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:40,946
Thanks.

208
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,801
What is it now?

209
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:11,017
- Have some snacks.
- Why are you giving these to me?

210
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:14,813
I told you I wasn't your lover
in my former life.

211
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:17,065
- I know.
- Then why are you doing this?

212
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:20,735
I can't eat these anyway.

213
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,697
And sweets make people happy.

214
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:25,949
Mr. Seon Woo-hyeol, do you like me?

215
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:27,325
What?

216
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:30,996
Haven't you heard the rumor?

217
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,206
What rumor?

218
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:36,585
That there's something going on
between you and me.

219
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:40,297
Like what?

220
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:42,799
I mean...

221
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:44,843
People think...

222
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:48,221
we're dating or something!

223
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:49,556
How ridiculous!

224
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,099
Who in the world...

225
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:54,686
Excuse me. I, too, hate
to be associated with you.

226
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:58,481
I'm stressed out as is
with my upcoming contract renewal.

227
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:00,859
What contract renewal?

228
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:03,320
Forget it. It's none of your business.

229
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,156
Those ridiculous rumors
aren't worth our time.

230
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:09,451
So don't be affected by it

231
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:11,369
and focus on doing your job.

232
00:15:11,453 --> 00:15:12,746
And don't bring me stuff like this.

233
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:14,831
What are all these?

234
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:18,335
Lollipops, chocolate, jellies...

235
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:21,046
They're full of sugar.

236
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:23,298
Too much sugar causes diabetes.

237
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:25,133
I was just--

238
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:27,510
Are you trying to kill me
so you can take over the house?

239
00:15:27,886 --> 00:15:30,513
Dream on. I'm going to live long.

240
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:32,515
Take it and leave.

241
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:34,267
Go.

242
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:39,147
No. I've given it to you,
so you do whatever you want with it.

243
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:43,652
What's with him?

244
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:55,580
How am I supposed to make
a woman like her fall in love?

245
00:15:57,707 --> 00:16:01,211
Make her feel loved.

246
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:04,172
They say one needs to be loved
before they can love.

247
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:05,340
The same goes for her.

248
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,635
Make her feel
that there's someone who loves her

249
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:11,304
and is rooting for her.

250
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:14,557
How?

251
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:21,648
Anonymous love letters.

252
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:34,536
This is my heartfelt gift to you.

253
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:53,805
You're more beautiful than a flower.

254
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:55,932
I hope you have a good day.

255
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:03,273
You were born to be loved.

256
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:06,192
I'm always rooting for you.

257
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:26,838
So it's a flower basket this time?

258
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,467
You must be very popular, Butler Joo.

259
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,885
Hello, is this the police?

260
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:33,678
I'd like to report a stalker.

261
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:36,931
Some lunatic has been leaving
flowers and notes on my doorstep every--

262
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,226
- What are you doing?
- What do you think?

263
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,770
I'm filing a police report.

264
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:43,313
Exactly.

265
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,398
Why are you reporting this to the police?

266
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:46,524
Can't you see?

267
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:49,110
Someone's been leaving these
on the doorstep every day.

268
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:51,321
But...

269
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:53,448
you should consider
this person's feelings.

270
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:56,659
I hate people who do this
without revealing their identity.

271
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:00,121
When you receive these,

272
00:18:00,205 --> 00:18:02,749
aren't you supposed to feel loved

273
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:05,126
and get excited?

274
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:07,253
Excited, my foot.

275
00:18:07,337 --> 00:18:10,006
It creeps me out because
it feels like someone's watching me.

276
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,591
Well, that didn't work.

277
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:13,301
What did you say?

278
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:14,594
Nothing.

279
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:22,560
She almost had the police
come to the house.

280
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:24,145
What?

281
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,400
That's odd. It works most of the time.

282
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:31,653
As if! Things could've been bad.

283
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:33,404
Is that all you have to say?

284
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:36,574
Since she's never been in love
or a romantic relationship,

285
00:18:36,658 --> 00:18:38,034
even if someone is nice to her,

286
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,870
she must assume
there's an ulterior motive.

287
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:43,665
An ulterior motive?

288
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:49,921
Woo-hyeol. How about you try
audiovisual training?

289
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,048
Audiovisual training?

290
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:53,216
Yes.

291
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,093
When she sees couples that are in love,

292
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:57,387
she might be able to feel something.

293
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:19,117
Goodness, you're being very distracting.

294
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:21,703
What is it? Do you have something to say?

295
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:27,000
Are you free tomorrow by any chance?

296
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:28,585
Why?

297
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:29,544
Well...

298
00:19:32,714 --> 00:19:33,840
Look here.

299
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:36,259
I got these.

300
00:19:37,552 --> 00:19:39,053
"Movie tickets"?

301
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:41,890
Where did you get them?

302
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:47,812
Do you know the tteokbokki shop
in front of the school?

303
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:50,732
I won a prize there.
It's called Dong-seop Snack Shop.

304
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,568
- Tteokbokki shop?
- Yes.

305
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:55,028
But you can't eat tteokbokki.

306
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,116
Well...

307
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:03,578
I was running an errand
for my fellow cleaning ladies.

308
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,205
Your fellow cleaning ladies?

309
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:09,042
Anyway.

310
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:13,296
Do you want to go with me?

311
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:16,674
As you know, I was asleep for 100 years,

312
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:19,344
so I haven't had the chance
to engage in new cultural activities.

313
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:22,805
And I don't know how to use these tickets.

314
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:25,600
Do you think I'll go with you?

315
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:26,517
Why not?

316
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:28,728
Do you not like going to the movies?

317
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:31,356
It's not that I don't like
going to the movies.

318
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:33,983
When a man and woman go to the movies,
it means they're on a date...

319
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,569
What I mean is...

320
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:40,031
Anyway, you don't go to the movies
just to watch movies.

321
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:42,158
What do you mean?

322
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:46,037
Who is that?

323
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:54,879
Who are you?

324
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:59,550
I thought that young man
was the only one who lives here.

325
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:02,220
- Well, that's...
- Anyway,

326
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:04,013
I came by to drop this off.

327
00:21:08,226 --> 00:21:09,227
What's wrong?

328
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:11,104
That...

329
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:14,023
- That...
- What is it?

330
00:21:16,526 --> 00:21:17,944
What brings you here?

331
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:19,654
So you were home.

332
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:21,739
You wanted to buy ox blood the other day.

333
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:23,950
- Right.
- I had some leftovers.

334
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:26,244
You can have it if you want.

335
00:21:26,703 --> 00:21:28,037
It's still fresh.

336
00:21:30,665 --> 00:21:31,749
Why would you smell that?

337
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:38,589
Thank you. I really appreciate it.
You'll be blessed.

338
00:21:38,673 --> 00:21:39,966
You definitely will.

339
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:42,176
Why are your hands so cold?

340
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:45,430
Cold hypersensitivity!

341
00:21:46,389 --> 00:21:48,141
That's why.

342
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:50,476
He has poor blood circulation.

343
00:21:51,561 --> 00:21:52,854
By the way,

344
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:54,397
how come you guys live together?

345
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:55,648
Are you newlyweds?

346
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:58,818
No! Never.

347
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:00,403
If not,

348
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:02,780
why would a young man and woman
live under the same roof?

349
00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:05,450
That's because...

350
00:22:07,577 --> 00:22:09,203
Haven't you heard of shared housing?

351
00:22:09,871 --> 00:22:10,913
- What?
- What?

352
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:12,290
Shared housing.

353
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:14,375
People live together and split the rent

354
00:22:14,459 --> 00:22:17,295
because housing prices
are so high these days.

355
00:22:17,754 --> 00:22:20,006
It's a trend among young people.

356
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:22,800
- I guess you didn't know.
- What a ridiculous trend.

357
00:22:23,718 --> 00:22:26,929
You can just say you're living together.
What's with the complicated explanation?

358
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:28,181
Because that's not it!

359
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:30,725
We strictly use
separate areas of the house.

360
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:33,561
It's really not what you think.

361
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:35,229
All right, whatever you say.

362
00:22:35,313 --> 00:22:37,023
But I'm telling the truth.

363
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:37,982
I'm done here.

364
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:38,983
- I'll get going.
- Okay.

365
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:40,860
Go back inside.

366
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:42,195
- Wait.
- Go on.

367
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:43,821
- Goodbye.
- It's not what you...

368
00:22:53,915 --> 00:22:55,792
You're quite the social butterfly.

369
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:58,878
When did you become friends
with the butcher shop owner?

370
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:01,214
I'm a vampire, not a butterfly.

371
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:03,633
A very sociable one, at that.

372
00:23:07,095 --> 00:23:11,182
Weird rumors will spread throughout
the whole neighborhood now.

373
00:23:13,476 --> 00:23:16,896
Aren't you the one who said
those rumors weren't worth our time?

374
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:20,650
Don't tell me...

375
00:23:23,528 --> 00:23:26,989
Are you not going to the movies with me
because of the rumors?

376
00:23:27,698 --> 00:23:30,201
What are you saying?

377
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:31,244
You know,

378
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:33,996
the lady thinking
we're newlyweds and whatnot.

379
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:35,748
Is that the reason why?

380
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:39,210
Fine, I'll go!

381
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:41,921
As I said, those stupid rumors
aren't worth our time!

382
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:43,506
Exactly.

383
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:46,092
Let's not worry about what others think.

384
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,553
But still, be careful.

385
00:23:48,636 --> 00:23:51,472
If you do anything even vaguely weird,
I'll just leave you there.

386
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:53,391
Like what?

387
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:58,521
What are you trying to imply?

388
00:23:59,981 --> 00:24:02,942
You're the one who's...

389
00:24:03,985 --> 00:24:05,111
I get it.

390
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:07,905
I'll see you
at the fourteenth hour tomorrow.

391
00:24:08,531 --> 00:24:09,824
- Fourteenth hour?
- Yes.

392
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:15,037
All right, then I'll meet you here
at 2:00 p.m.

393
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:24,714
What?

394
00:24:27,175 --> 00:24:28,551
I'm going to my room.

395
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:41,105
Oh, my!

396
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:43,941
Then Woo-hyeol, are you going on a date

397
00:24:44,275 --> 00:24:46,152
with that human woman?

398
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:49,030
It's more of a task than a date.

399
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:52,033
It's his desperate attempt
to become human.

400
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:55,453
Have you decided what movie to watch?

401
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:56,913
Decide?

402
00:24:57,788 --> 00:24:58,956
Is there more than one movie?

403
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:02,251
Action, comedy, romance, horror.
There are many genres to choose from.

404
00:25:02,335 --> 00:25:05,213
Since the goal is to teach her
about love, go for romance.

405
00:25:05,963 --> 00:25:07,965
A sweet love story.

406
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:11,177
Romance!

407
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:16,349
However, what's more urgent
than choosing a movie

408
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:17,850
is choosing my outfit.

409
00:25:17,934 --> 00:25:21,229
That's right.
What you wear is extremely important.

410
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:23,314
I haven't been to the movies
in a long time,

411
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:26,359
so I have no idea what to wear.

412
00:25:27,318 --> 00:25:29,987
I only feel satisfied
when I choose my outfit

413
00:25:30,071 --> 00:25:33,324
according to
the place, time, and occasion.

414
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:36,953
You're not going to a film festival.
You're going to the movies.

415
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:38,204
Don't go overboard.

416
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:40,915
Don't go what?

417
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:43,501
Woo-hyeol.

418
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:46,671
Just wear casual clothes like these.

419
00:25:46,963 --> 00:25:48,130
It'll be enough.

420
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,092
That's not a good idea.

421
00:25:52,718 --> 00:25:54,971
It'll only be uncomfortable
if you get suited up.

422
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:57,598
Just go for the effortlessly chic look.

423
00:25:58,266 --> 00:25:59,976
- What?
- Effortlessly chic.

424
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:02,603
- Effortlessly what?
- Go for the effortlessly chic look.

425
00:26:02,687 --> 00:26:03,729
Go where?

426
00:26:03,813 --> 00:26:05,398
Just do as I say.

427
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:06,565
Go for the effortless look.

428
00:26:06,649 --> 00:26:09,151
Woo-hyeol, there's this thing
called the effortlessly chic look.

429
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:12,530
It means that you should look good
without trying too hard.

430
00:26:13,281 --> 00:26:15,283
Hold on. Do you want me to help?

431
00:26:15,533 --> 00:26:18,119
When it comes to men's clothes,

432
00:26:18,703 --> 00:26:20,121
you should trust women's opinions.

433
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:21,205
Sure.

434
00:26:21,664 --> 00:26:23,082
Please assist me.

435
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:25,960
Let's see.

436
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:28,379
- This one.
- This is perfect.

437
00:26:28,462 --> 00:26:30,464
- This is it.
- No, next.

438
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:34,260
Are you entering a talent show? Next.

439
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:36,887
Goodness, look how great he looks.

440
00:26:36,971 --> 00:26:38,014
You paid for that?

441
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:39,015
I did.

442
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:40,641
Oh, my gosh.

443
00:26:40,725 --> 00:26:41,684
Effortlessly chic?

444
00:26:42,143 --> 00:26:43,519
Are these all you have?

445
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:46,689
Sang-hae, remember
that coat I sold to you?

446
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:47,690
Where is it?

447
00:27:20,348 --> 00:27:23,267
You did a good job dressing
like someone from this generation.

448
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:27,646
So? How do I look?

449
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:29,857
Well, you look pretty good.

450
00:27:30,775 --> 00:27:33,027
But where did you get these clothes?

451
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:36,113
Well...

452
00:27:38,032 --> 00:27:39,867
That tteokbokki shop.

453
00:27:40,242 --> 00:27:41,911
I won a prize there again.

454
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:44,789
Does a tteokbokki shop
usually give prizes like these?

455
00:27:47,917 --> 00:27:48,751
Let's go.

456
00:27:49,377 --> 00:27:50,378
Okay.

457
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:02,848
What on earth is their relationship?

458
00:28:03,099 --> 00:28:06,644
They're neither strangers nor lovers.

459
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,507
Butler Joo.

460
00:28:48,853 --> 00:28:50,020
Are you upset?

461
00:28:51,856 --> 00:28:53,357
You enjoyed the movie, didn't you?

462
00:28:56,277 --> 00:28:58,529
After telling me not to do anything weird,

463
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,990
how could you snore at the movies?

464
00:29:01,991 --> 00:29:03,409
I almost died of embarrassment.

465
00:29:04,827 --> 00:29:07,413
I didn't get much sleep last night.

466
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:10,416
Didn't I tell you to go to bed early?

467
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:12,710
Did the thought of
going to the movies with me

468
00:29:13,377 --> 00:29:15,838
- keep you from sleeping?
- How did you know...

469
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:17,756
I mean...

470
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,842
I just couldn't fall asleep!

471
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:21,844
I'm never going anywhere with you again!

472
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,515
What is he even saying?

473
00:29:26,849 --> 00:29:28,976
How ridiculous.

474
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:37,568
Wow.

475
00:29:40,154 --> 00:29:42,406
- Look who it is.
- You've lost a lot of weight.

476
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:45,201
With Na Hae-won, my soulmate, so far away,

477
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:47,161
I felt lonely and empty.

478
00:29:47,244 --> 00:29:48,871
Soulmate, my foot.

479
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:50,623
Aren't we business partners?

480
00:29:51,332 --> 00:29:52,333
That's harsh.

481
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:54,835
How can you say that?

482
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:56,420
We have unfinished business.

483
00:29:57,421 --> 00:29:58,464
Which is?

484
00:29:59,215 --> 00:30:01,175
Haven't you heard the news about
Gongcheon-dong?

485
00:30:04,178 --> 00:30:07,473
Right, are you talking about the mansion?

486
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:08,724
Yes.

487
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:11,185
I think I'm hooked.

488
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:12,269
I can't seem to give up on it.

489
00:30:13,229 --> 00:30:14,939
You want it that badly?

490
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:18,442
There's nothing you can't do
if you set your mind to it.

491
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:37,670
It's not easy, is it?

492
00:30:39,922 --> 00:30:40,965
Mr. Ko.

493
00:30:41,382 --> 00:30:45,135
Did you think it'd be easy to turn
poisonous blood into blood full of love?

494
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:50,891
Sweets and romantic movies won't cut it.

495
00:30:51,225 --> 00:30:53,435
It'd be a miracle if those tricks worked.

496
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:57,314
As expected, you already know everything.

497
00:30:57,606 --> 00:31:00,276
You need to make genuine efforts.

498
00:31:00,693 --> 00:31:01,735
Genuine efforts?

499
00:31:02,945 --> 00:31:04,572
Pay more attention to her.

500
00:31:05,114 --> 00:31:07,741
Have you once thought about
how she ended up

501
00:31:07,825 --> 00:31:09,285
with such poisonous blood?

502
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:11,537
- No.
- Goodness.

503
00:31:14,164 --> 00:31:16,667
Turning poisonous blood
into blood full of love

504
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,335
is no easy feat.

505
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:21,380
It's as hard as sleeping inside
a hawthorn coffin for a century.

506
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:24,633
Perhaps it's even more difficult
than that.

507
00:31:25,801 --> 00:31:27,136
Goodness.

508
00:31:28,262 --> 00:31:29,638
You must touch her heart.

509
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:32,391
Feelings, not tricks.

510
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:43,027
GONGCHEON HIGH SCHOOL

511
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,778
You won't renew my contract?

512
00:31:44,862 --> 00:31:48,282
It was decided
at the school board meeting.

513
00:31:48,365 --> 00:31:50,200
But the contract isn't up yet.

514
00:31:51,118 --> 00:31:52,077
This is too sudden.

515
00:31:52,161 --> 00:31:54,705
It wasn't an easy decision.

516
00:31:56,582 --> 00:31:59,710
There are rumors going around about you.

517
00:32:00,294 --> 00:32:02,254
From cutting a student's hair

518
00:32:02,338 --> 00:32:03,631
to the recent fire...

519
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:10,846
Are you blaming me for those incidents?

520
00:32:12,014 --> 00:32:14,516
You should've let sleeping dogs lie.

521
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,935
Do you know how much trouble
you caused us?

522
00:32:17,645 --> 00:32:19,938
All I had to do was fire that custodian,

523
00:32:20,189 --> 00:32:21,607
so why did you have to butt in?

524
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:25,402
Anyway, we have no intention
of renewing your contract,

525
00:32:25,486 --> 00:32:27,071
so prepare to hand over your duties.

526
00:32:33,661 --> 00:32:36,121
Oh, have you heard
about Ms. Joo, the school nurse?

527
00:32:36,747 --> 00:32:38,624
Her contract won't be renewed.

528
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:42,086
She shouldn't have stood up
for that custodian.

529
00:33:02,773 --> 00:33:04,024
What brings you here?

530
00:33:15,536 --> 00:33:16,537
Butler Joo.

531
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:19,456
By any chance,

532
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:22,960
did you get fired because of me?

533
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:24,086
Who said that?

534
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,922
I heard people talking.

535
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:31,927
They said you got fired
because you stood up for me.

536
00:33:32,219 --> 00:33:34,388
I didn't stand up for anyone.

537
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:38,100
I only said what I saw.

538
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,233
It's not because of you.

539
00:33:46,984 --> 00:33:48,777
This has nothing to do with you.

540
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,781
The principal always disliked me.

541
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:00,080
I'm serious.

542
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:04,793
He hates people
who say everything that's on their minds

543
00:34:04,877 --> 00:34:08,172
and butt into other people's business.

544
00:34:10,841 --> 00:34:11,967
Goodness.

545
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:14,511
I should be the one getting comforted.

546
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:34,132
She must've liked it.

547
00:35:43,392 --> 00:35:45,060
MAIN DISH

548
00:35:45,769 --> 00:35:48,146
We'll have a cheese platter
and a bottle of Côtes-du Village.

549
00:35:52,276 --> 00:35:53,610
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

550
00:35:57,656 --> 00:36:00,200
Can I have a cheese platter

551
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:02,369
and a bottle of Côtes-du Village?

552
00:36:02,452 --> 00:36:03,620
Sure.

553
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:13,899
I'd like to pay.

554
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:16,735
Ma'am, we're doing a lucky draw
to celebrate the opening of our bar.

555
00:37:17,194 --> 00:37:18,528
Would you like to participate?

556
00:37:30,207 --> 00:37:31,750
It says, "Free pass."

557
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:35,087
What does it mean?

558
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,129
Congratulations.

559
00:37:36,713 --> 00:37:39,216
Everything you ordered today
is on the house.

560
00:37:42,052 --> 00:37:43,762
- It's free?
- Yes.

561
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:46,890
It's your lucky day. Congratulations.

562
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:50,852
Thank you.

563
00:38:08,829 --> 00:38:09,830
Should we drive her home?

564
00:38:11,123 --> 00:38:12,082
No.

565
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:14,751
There are days when you want to be alone.

566
00:38:16,128 --> 00:38:19,131
It'd be insensitive of me
to approach her now.

567
00:38:57,002 --> 00:38:59,337
It's late. Why isn't she home yet?

568
00:39:04,051 --> 00:39:05,594
What do I care?

569
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:24,321
Guys, stop!

570
00:39:24,404 --> 00:39:26,073
Gosh, can you...

571
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:33,705
Do-sik.

572
00:39:34,081 --> 00:39:35,165
Are you okay?

573
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:38,251
Yes, I'm fine.

574
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:45,634
What brings you here?

575
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:46,635
What?

576
00:39:47,177 --> 00:39:49,846
Right, I was just passing by.

577
00:39:50,055 --> 00:39:51,056
I see.

578
00:39:51,431 --> 00:39:53,683
Anyway, did something happen today?

579
00:39:54,476 --> 00:39:56,061
Why did you drink so much?

580
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:04,069
I'm out of work.

581
00:40:04,778 --> 00:40:06,363
The school didn't renew my contract.

582
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:12,869
I was feeling down,
so I wanted to drink a little.

583
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:16,456
But it's okay.

584
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:20,252
Why do you always say things are okay?

585
00:40:23,463 --> 00:40:24,631
Don't drink alone next time.

586
00:40:25,215 --> 00:40:26,133
I'll drink with you.

587
00:40:36,226 --> 00:40:38,061
You'll catch a cold. You should head home.

588
00:40:38,645 --> 00:40:39,771
Okay.

589
00:40:49,865 --> 00:40:50,866
Bye.

590
00:41:06,882 --> 00:41:11,678
FREE PASS

591
00:41:25,442 --> 00:41:26,651
Is everything okay, sir?

592
00:41:27,736 --> 00:41:29,070
Sorry? Why?

593
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:33,909
You seem to be happy
and in good condition these days.

594
00:41:34,784 --> 00:41:36,286
Is there something going on
that I'm unaware of?

595
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:41,291
- Does it seem that way?
- I've known you for a long time,

596
00:41:42,292 --> 00:41:43,960
and you've been acting differently lately.

597
00:41:44,044 --> 00:41:45,420
Like what you did at the bar earlier.

598
00:41:47,172 --> 00:41:48,715
Pretend you never saw that.

599
00:41:48,924 --> 00:41:50,842
Okay. Don't worry, sir.

600
00:41:51,927 --> 00:41:53,637
Anyway, I'm glad you look happy.

601
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:54,971
I am.

602
00:41:55,764 --> 00:41:58,308
It feels like
I'm an innocent college student again.

603
00:42:05,065 --> 00:42:07,234
Butler Joo,
don't you know what time it is?

604
00:42:08,568 --> 00:42:10,862
Gosh, you reek of alcohol.

605
00:42:11,988 --> 00:42:13,531
You're completely wasted,

606
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:15,200
and you bought more alcohol?

607
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:16,576
So what?

608
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:19,287
I can't even drink when I want to?

609
00:42:19,371 --> 00:42:22,457
I need to relieve my stress
one way or another.

610
00:42:36,388 --> 00:42:39,015
You said you wanted to become human
to experience love

611
00:42:39,099 --> 00:42:40,642
that makes your heart beat, right?

612
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:43,687
- Yes.
- But you know,

613
00:42:44,938 --> 00:42:46,815
the reality isn't

614
00:42:47,315 --> 00:42:50,902
as beautiful or romantic as you think.

615
00:42:51,444 --> 00:42:52,946
Love that makes your heart beat?

616
00:42:57,784 --> 00:43:00,161
My heart only beats once every two years.

617
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:07,168
Why is that?

618
00:43:07,544 --> 00:43:10,422
My contracts renew every two years.

619
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:13,675
Both my house contract

620
00:43:14,634 --> 00:43:17,637
and my employment contract.

621
00:43:18,722 --> 00:43:23,101
So every two years,
I worry if I'll get kicked out of my house

622
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:26,313
or get fired from my job.

623
00:43:26,855 --> 00:43:29,441
It makes...

624
00:43:29,899 --> 00:43:31,234
my heart go...

625
00:43:37,657 --> 00:43:39,242
It makes my heart beat like crazy.

626
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:44,622
Are you saying...

627
00:43:45,498 --> 00:43:47,334
you've never experienced love

628
00:43:48,585 --> 00:43:50,420
that makes your heart beat?

629
00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:56,634
I had no time to.

630
00:44:01,765 --> 00:44:03,683
My mom was very sick.

631
00:44:04,351 --> 00:44:07,604
And debts were piling up
because of her hospital bills.

632
00:44:08,021 --> 00:44:11,483
My dad moved from place to place
looking for work

633
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:13,610
and running away from the creditors.

634
00:44:14,069 --> 00:44:16,863
At some point, he lost touch,

635
00:44:16,946 --> 00:44:19,115
and he didn't even come
to my mom's funeral.

636
00:44:33,588 --> 00:44:35,799
I think that's when I realized,

637
00:44:36,883 --> 00:44:37,842
"Right,

638
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:40,804
I'm alone."

639
00:44:42,055 --> 00:44:43,932
"I need to survive at all costs."

640
00:44:45,392 --> 00:44:48,061
I couldn't even dream of dating.

641
00:44:48,978 --> 00:44:51,481
Even the thought of dating
was a luxury to me.

642
00:45:01,658 --> 00:45:04,661
But look where I've ended up
even after working so hard.

643
00:45:07,914 --> 00:45:10,792
All my blood, sweat, and tears

644
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:13,169
went right down the drain.

645
00:45:19,384 --> 00:45:22,137
I don't know what more I can do now.

646
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:42,282
You're doing great.

647
00:45:44,701 --> 00:45:46,870
Although you were alone,
you stayed strong.

648
00:45:50,165 --> 00:45:51,374
It's admirable.

649
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:53,793
I'm proud of you.

650
00:46:23,907 --> 00:46:25,450
I must be drunk.

651
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:32,957
I'm going to my room.

652
00:46:33,833 --> 00:46:34,834
Okay.

653
00:46:35,835 --> 00:46:37,253
What's wrong with me?

654
00:46:58,149 --> 00:46:59,776
What a pleasant morning.

655
00:47:13,915 --> 00:47:15,124
Butler Joo.

656
00:47:20,129 --> 00:47:21,381
Butler Joo.

657
00:47:25,051 --> 00:47:28,137
She's not one to sleep in till this late.

658
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:30,515
Butler Joo.

659
00:47:35,603 --> 00:47:36,729
Butler Joo?

660
00:47:39,816 --> 00:47:41,150
Are you still sleeping?

661
00:47:50,994 --> 00:47:54,372
Butler Joo,
I'm not trying to do anything weird here,

662
00:47:54,706 --> 00:47:56,416
so don't use that spray thing again, okay?

663
00:48:00,253 --> 00:48:01,629
Butler Joo?

664
00:48:03,131 --> 00:48:04,924
Don't spray anything.

665
00:48:06,384 --> 00:48:07,427
Butler Joo.

666
00:48:09,512 --> 00:48:10,805
Goodness.

667
00:48:11,097 --> 00:48:13,600
How can you still be asleep?

668
00:48:14,767 --> 00:48:16,894
Butler Joo, don't you know what time...

669
00:48:19,856 --> 00:48:20,773
Butler Joo.

670
00:48:21,608 --> 00:48:22,442
Butler Joo.

671
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:25,903
She's burning up.

672
00:48:26,279 --> 00:48:27,322
Are you not feeling well?

673
00:48:27,655 --> 00:48:28,656
I'm okay.

674
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:31,159
What do you mean you're okay?
You look like you're dying.

675
00:48:52,972 --> 00:48:55,975
But look where I've ended up
even after working so hard.

676
00:48:57,226 --> 00:49:00,021
All my blood, sweat, and tears

677
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:02,398
went right down the drain.

678
00:49:06,152 --> 00:49:08,905
I don't know what more I can do now.

679
00:49:28,925 --> 00:49:29,926
Right.

680
00:49:31,302 --> 00:49:32,220
This is it.

681
00:49:36,849 --> 00:49:41,646
DONGUI BOGAM

682
00:49:42,438 --> 00:49:43,481
Goodness.

683
00:49:56,828 --> 00:49:57,870
Excuse me.

684
00:49:59,247 --> 00:50:01,290
Hello, we've met before.

685
00:50:01,374 --> 00:50:02,875
I'm Shin Do-sik, In-hae's college friend.

686
00:50:05,336 --> 00:50:06,212
And?

687
00:50:06,295 --> 00:50:08,423
Is In-hae home?

688
00:50:10,967 --> 00:50:13,761
Yes, but I'm afraid she's sick in bed.

689
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:15,596
I see.

690
00:50:16,389 --> 00:50:18,433
Then can you give this to her?

691
00:50:19,934 --> 00:50:20,935
What is this?

692
00:50:22,437 --> 00:50:25,148
She seemed to be coming down
with a cold, so I got worried.

693
00:50:25,982 --> 00:50:27,275
How did you know?

694
00:50:29,902 --> 00:50:30,862
"Ssanghwa-tang"?

695
00:50:31,237 --> 00:50:33,740
The ssanghwa-tang
from Dongui Bogam that's made from

696
00:50:33,823 --> 00:50:35,616
white woodland peony,
broomrape, and cnidium.

697
00:50:37,535 --> 00:50:39,162
You can get hold of it so easily now.

698
00:50:41,831 --> 00:50:43,082
Goodbye then.

699
00:51:03,728 --> 00:51:06,314
Here. I made this ssanghwa-tang myself.

700
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:08,441
Why would you make it?

701
00:51:08,524 --> 00:51:12,445
Medicine is only effective
when prepared with care.

702
00:51:12,653 --> 00:51:14,155
Drink up.

703
00:51:34,967 --> 00:51:36,511
You must've been tired.

704
00:51:36,594 --> 00:51:37,512
Right.

705
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:45,520
You look better.

706
00:51:46,395 --> 00:51:48,439
The ssanghwa-tang you made was a big help.

707
00:51:57,281 --> 00:52:00,409
Did I make any mistakes last night?

708
00:52:00,493 --> 00:52:01,828
In fact, you did.

709
00:52:02,161 --> 00:52:05,456
You went on and on about
how your heart beats every two years.

710
00:52:06,332 --> 00:52:07,875
What are you talking about?

711
00:52:09,836 --> 00:52:13,130
Seeing how you're raising your voice,
you must feel better now.

712
00:52:15,299 --> 00:52:18,302
Anyway, thank you for caring for me.

713
00:52:19,428 --> 00:52:21,264
I only ever looked after sick people,

714
00:52:21,347 --> 00:52:24,392
but I never had someone take care of me
when I was sick.

715
00:52:26,644 --> 00:52:27,812
It feels nice.

716
00:52:30,022 --> 00:52:32,108
Well, it's nothing.

717
00:52:42,785 --> 00:52:44,245
I'm getting a call.

718
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:46,914
Hello?

719
00:52:46,998 --> 00:52:48,124
Do-sik?

720
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:54,297
Here are your drinks.

721
00:52:54,714 --> 00:52:55,923
Thank you.

722
00:53:06,475 --> 00:53:07,476
Here.

723
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:08,394
Thank you.

724
00:53:11,022 --> 00:53:13,274
I didn't force you to come out
when you're still unwell, did I?

725
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:15,276
Are you really okay?

726
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:16,694
Yes, I'm okay.

727
00:53:17,278 --> 00:53:18,905
I took medicine, so I'm feeling better.

728
00:53:20,156 --> 00:53:21,198
That's a relief.

729
00:53:21,991 --> 00:53:24,035
Are you in a better mood as well?

730
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:25,578
Yes.

731
00:53:25,661 --> 00:53:27,663
That's good.
You should take care of yourself.

732
00:53:33,628 --> 00:53:35,880
How is it staying in that mansion?

733
00:53:36,589 --> 00:53:38,549
The house is big so it must feel empty.

734
00:53:39,634 --> 00:53:40,551
Considering how old it is,

735
00:53:40,635 --> 00:53:42,720
I'm sure there are issues
with insulation and heating.

736
00:53:42,803 --> 00:53:44,096
There must be bad drafts too.

737
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:45,765
That's true.

738
00:53:47,058 --> 00:53:49,518
But I don't really have a choice.

739
00:53:49,894 --> 00:53:52,521
Still, it's important to live
in a decent place.

740
00:53:52,939 --> 00:53:55,524
I think it'd be better for you to live
in a warmer and cozier place.

741
00:53:55,858 --> 00:53:58,027
Have you considered moving?

742
00:54:00,321 --> 00:54:01,864
For now,

743
00:54:01,948 --> 00:54:04,575
I don't think that's possible.

744
00:54:04,659 --> 00:54:08,537
Are you competing with Mr. Seon
for the rights?

745
00:54:08,621 --> 00:54:10,414
If that's the case,
I might be able to help.

746
00:54:10,498 --> 00:54:12,124
No, that's not it.

747
00:54:12,959 --> 00:54:15,211
It's a personal matter.

748
00:54:15,628 --> 00:54:16,462
Sorry?

749
00:54:16,545 --> 00:54:18,923
I think I have to live there
for the time being.

750
00:54:39,986 --> 00:54:42,655
SCHOOL NURSE JOO IN-HAE

751
00:54:52,915 --> 00:54:55,376
It's admirable. I'm proud of you.

752
00:54:57,545 --> 00:54:59,755
Although you were alone,
you stayed strong.

753
00:55:08,014 --> 00:55:09,140
Ms. Joo!

754
00:55:15,604 --> 00:55:18,941
I've been meaning to tell you this
for a long time.

755
00:55:21,736 --> 00:55:23,904
Thank you for what you did that day.

756
00:55:24,238 --> 00:55:25,781
Thank you for paying attention to me.

757
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:44,008
Na-rae, you stayed strong.

758
00:55:45,217 --> 00:55:46,844
It's admirable, and I'm proud of you.

759
00:55:49,847 --> 00:55:51,599
Good luck
with the rest of your school years.

760
00:55:52,099 --> 00:55:54,185
If you ever end up in a similar situation,

761
00:55:54,268 --> 00:55:56,145
let your parents know.

762
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,105
They're always on your side.

763
00:55:59,398 --> 00:56:00,399
Okay?

764
00:56:01,108 --> 00:56:01,942
Okay.

765
00:56:59,208 --> 00:57:00,709
I'm really jobless now.

766
00:57:01,836 --> 00:57:05,172
How will I pay my card bills
and taxes next month?

767
00:57:07,133 --> 00:57:08,509
What do I do?

768
00:57:16,892 --> 00:57:19,019
Nothing seems to be going my way.

769
00:57:30,072 --> 00:57:32,199
Come to think of it,

770
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:35,244
I haven't been down here
since my first day.

771
00:58:11,155 --> 00:58:14,783
Gosh, I was too distracted back then
to notice anything.

772
00:58:15,284 --> 00:58:17,453
So this is what the basement is like.

773
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:57,243
Butler Joo?

774
00:58:57,910 --> 00:58:59,245
What are you doing down here?

775
00:58:59,828 --> 00:59:01,163
You startled me.

776
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:03,374
I didn't hear you come in.

777
00:59:04,375 --> 00:59:06,585
Must I knock when entering my room?

778
00:59:07,795 --> 00:59:09,338
What are you doing here?

779
00:59:11,215 --> 00:59:12,132
I'm sorry.

780
00:59:12,216 --> 00:59:14,176
So what happened was...

781
00:59:22,393 --> 00:59:23,519
Is this her?

782
00:59:24,478 --> 00:59:26,897
The woman you're waiting for?

783
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:34,738
Yes, it is.

784
00:59:54,383 --> 00:59:55,718
What would happen...

785
00:59:58,762 --> 00:59:59,847
What would happen

786
01:00:00,431 --> 01:00:04,143
if I really was her in my former life?

787
01:00:07,313 --> 01:00:09,148
Would you fall in love with me?

788
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:04,703
HEARTBEAT

789
01:01:04,912 --> 01:01:07,748
What do you think about running a business
with the mansion you live in?

790
01:01:07,831 --> 01:01:09,500
A guest house? Never in a million years.

791
01:01:09,583 --> 01:01:11,377
A hot spot like Shaded Oasis.

792
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:13,670
There's a higher chance
that Hae-sun will come here.

793
01:01:13,754 --> 01:01:14,630
Go ahead.

794
01:01:14,922 --> 01:01:16,090
You want to invest?

795
01:01:16,173 --> 01:01:17,174
I'm curious.

796
01:01:17,257 --> 01:01:19,510
For what reason has it managed
to stand firm all these years?

797
01:01:19,593 --> 01:01:21,387
She seemed familiar.

798
01:01:21,470 --> 01:01:23,680
I can only become human
by drinking Butler Joo's blood

799
01:01:23,764 --> 01:01:24,681
after she falls in love.

800
01:01:24,765 --> 01:01:25,933
Let's focus on that for now.

801
01:01:26,016 --> 01:01:28,727
It's pretty much done. You don't even
have to play matchmaker.

802
01:01:28,811 --> 01:01:30,145
What's with your face though?

803
01:01:30,229 --> 01:01:31,563
What? Why?

804
01:01:31,647 --> 01:01:33,649
What do you think of In-hae?

805
01:01:33,732 --> 01:01:35,442
She's the woman I wish to protect.

806
01:01:35,526 --> 01:01:38,821
The fact that I'm living with her
must really bother you.

807
01:01:38,904 --> 01:01:40,489
I'd be lying if I said it didn't.
