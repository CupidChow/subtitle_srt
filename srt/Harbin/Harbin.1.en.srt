1
00:02:08,515 --> 00:02:09,516
It's been over a month.

2
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:12,140
January 17, 1909, Russian Federation.

3
00:02:12,185 --> 00:02:14,396
What do you think, Chang-sup?

4
00:02:25,907 --> 00:02:27,993
If he's not back by now...

5
00:02:31,705 --> 00:02:34,207
...I think it's safe to say he's dead.

6
00:02:36,001 --> 00:02:38,462
He'll come back to us alive.

7
00:02:38,545 --> 00:02:40,422
If he does,

8
00:02:41,548 --> 00:02:44,217
it'll mean the Japanese
have made a spy out of him.

9
00:02:54,686 --> 00:02:56,313
Look here, Chang-sup.

10
00:02:57,939 --> 00:03:00,651
Let's not make any accusations
without any proof.

11
00:03:00,734 --> 00:03:06,031
Have you forgotten who it was
who got our comrades slaughtered?

12
00:03:06,114 --> 00:03:07,699
He had no choice!

13
00:03:07,783 --> 00:03:11,078
It was an idiotic choice
without an ounce of foresight!

14
00:03:11,203 --> 00:03:13,372
Chang-sup is right.

15
00:03:14,873 --> 00:03:16,583
There is no good excuse

16
00:03:17,167 --> 00:03:19,503
for siding with Ahn Jung-geun.

17
00:03:45,821 --> 00:03:47,531
Are you okay?

18
00:03:48,073 --> 00:03:50,200
Is it true you set
the enemy commander free?

19
00:03:50,909 --> 00:03:54,121
Did anyone return alive?

20
00:03:56,373 --> 00:03:58,625
They're waiting for you.

21
00:04:22,024 --> 00:04:23,317
Ahn.

22
00:04:23,525 --> 00:04:24,735
You're alive.

23
00:04:24,943 --> 00:04:27,821
I knew you'd come back.

24
00:04:28,989 --> 00:04:30,741
What...

25
00:04:32,576 --> 00:04:35,537
What's happened to you?

26
00:04:37,581 --> 00:04:39,082
Are you okay?

27
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,754
It's good to see you alive.

28
00:04:45,672 --> 00:04:47,299
Please have a seat.

29
00:04:53,972 --> 00:04:56,099
How dare you show your face around here?

30
00:04:56,224 --> 00:04:58,101
Watch it, Chang-sup.

31
00:04:58,185 --> 00:05:03,649
Whatever that man says,
I have no intention of forgiving him.

32
00:05:04,232 --> 00:05:06,568
I'm not here to ask for forgiveness.

33
00:05:10,364 --> 00:05:12,574
I'm here because
there's still more for me to do.

34
00:05:14,087 --> 00:05:16,245
40 days ago Gyeongheung,

35
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,606
North Hamgyong Province.

36
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,975
How is it looking?

37
00:05:38,058 --> 00:05:39,977
Looks like an advance party.

38
00:05:40,143 --> 00:05:42,145
Approximately 150 men.

39
00:05:43,313 --> 00:05:45,857
That's 70 more than us.

40
00:05:46,566 --> 00:05:47,943
This is not good.

41
00:05:48,568 --> 00:05:51,947
You don't win a fight with numbers.
We just have to take on two men each.

42
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:53,824
I get what you mean.

43
00:05:53,991 --> 00:05:58,036
But we really are at a disadvantage.
They have better weapons.

44
00:05:58,996 --> 00:06:00,330
What about guard posts?

45
00:06:00,414 --> 00:06:02,749
Two on the south, two on the north.

46
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:06,461
Then I'll attack from the south
with my squad.

47
00:06:06,545 --> 00:06:09,339
I'll strike from the north with Kim.

48
00:06:12,592 --> 00:06:16,805
In that case,
I'll hit the guard post first.

49
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,809
I'll draw their fire,
and you'll ambush them from both sides.

50
00:06:21,226 --> 00:06:24,229
Chang-sup, wait for my signal.

51
00:06:25,772 --> 00:06:26,606
Understood.

52
00:07:13,278 --> 00:07:14,112
Now!

53
00:07:27,542 --> 00:07:29,795
Get it together! Keep moving!

54
00:12:06,154 --> 00:12:10,993
Suzuki, stop crying. Die like a soldier.

55
00:12:12,119 --> 00:12:15,080
Suzuki, die like a soldier.

56
00:12:16,707 --> 00:12:17,916
Who are you?

57
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:19,209
Who are you?

58
00:12:19,292 --> 00:12:23,296
I'm Major Mori Tatsuo of
the Imperial Japanese Army.

59
00:12:23,547 --> 00:12:24,840
Who are you?

60
00:12:24,923 --> 00:12:27,968
Major Mori Tatsuo. Who are you?

61
00:12:28,593 --> 00:12:31,847
I'm Lt. General Ahn Jung-geun
of the Korean Independence Army.

62
00:12:32,472 --> 00:12:33,932
Anything to say?

63
00:12:34,224 --> 00:12:36,810
I'm Lt. General Ahn Jung-geun
of the Korean Independence Army.

64
00:12:38,186 --> 00:12:41,690
I followed my orders as a soldier.

65
00:12:42,274 --> 00:12:43,775
I feel no shame for my actions.

66
00:12:44,359 --> 00:12:45,235
However,

67
00:12:46,194 --> 00:12:49,323
I wish to die with honor as
an Imperial Japanese Army soldier.

68
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:51,450
Please allow me to take my own life.

69
00:12:51,533 --> 00:12:55,495
A man who knows no shame
is no better than a beast,

70
00:12:55,579 --> 00:12:58,040
you filthy animal.

71
00:12:59,374 --> 00:13:03,837
After all the innocent Koreans
you people slaughtered?

72
00:13:04,588 --> 00:13:06,506
You son of a bitch.

73
00:13:07,007 --> 00:13:09,301
- Woo.
- Let go. I'm gonna kill these assholes.

74
00:13:27,486 --> 00:13:28,904
Do you have a family?

75
00:13:30,489 --> 00:13:31,782
Do you have a family?

76
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:38,163
A wife and two sons.

77
00:13:39,164 --> 00:13:41,083
He's got a wife and two sons.

78
00:13:45,045 --> 00:13:48,799
I release you as prisoners of war,
so go treat the wounded soldiers.

79
00:13:48,882 --> 00:13:50,717
- What the hell?
- Comrade Ahn!

80
00:13:52,177 --> 00:13:55,138
You're released as prisoners of war,
so go treat the wounded soldiers.

81
00:13:58,517 --> 00:14:01,061
I've failed as a commander.
I'm too ashamed to live.

82
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:03,522
Allow me to protect my honor.

83
00:14:03,605 --> 00:14:05,774
I've failed as a commander.
I'm too ashamed to live.

84
00:14:06,233 --> 00:14:07,859
Let me die with honor.

85
00:14:09,444 --> 00:14:10,779
Major Mori.

86
00:14:12,447 --> 00:14:15,701
Don't let your kids be orphans.
Go home a living man.

87
00:14:15,784 --> 00:14:17,452
Ahn!

88
00:14:17,911 --> 00:14:20,122
Don't turn your kids into orphans.
Go home a living man.

89
00:14:21,707 --> 00:14:23,875
What's gotten into you?

90
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:25,919
Don't you fear the consequences?

91
00:14:26,712 --> 00:14:27,754
If you release them,

92
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,590
they'll only regroup and attack us again.

93
00:14:30,674 --> 00:14:33,260
If we take their weapons
and free them after we're gone,

94
00:14:33,343 --> 00:14:34,428
that won't be a problem.

95
00:14:34,511 --> 00:14:36,680
Freeing them will sow conflict
within the troops.

96
00:14:37,931 --> 00:14:40,684
Look at our dead comrades over there.

97
00:14:41,476 --> 00:14:42,477
Huh?

98
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:45,605
You think our men will stand for this?

99
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,245
I understand how you feel.

100
00:15:01,288 --> 00:15:07,294
But international law dictates
prisoners of war must not be executed.

101
00:15:10,672 --> 00:15:11,882
This is barbarism!

102
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,762
A single cannon is stronger
than 1,000 international laws.

103
00:15:17,554 --> 00:15:19,890
Those empty words you spew

104
00:15:22,017 --> 00:15:25,062
will let our comrades' deaths be in vain.

105
00:15:25,937 --> 00:15:29,399
Is it your goal to kill
all 40 million Japanese people?

106
00:15:30,692 --> 00:15:34,196
My goal is to restore
our nation's sovereignty.

107
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:38,241
If killing them all is what it'll cost
to free our nation,

108
00:15:38,617 --> 00:15:40,160
I wouldn't hesitate to do it.

109
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,499
Attempting to kill them all
will get all of us killed.

110
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,418
Don't you know that?

111
00:15:54,633 --> 00:16:00,514
You'll take full responsibility
for this decision.

112
00:16:08,658 --> 00:16:12,958
Hoeryong, North Hamgyong Province.

113
00:16:29,418 --> 00:16:32,379
Do you think I made the wrong decision?

114
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:38,593
Chang-sup left with the squad.

115
00:16:39,261 --> 00:16:41,680
And we've suffered massive losses.

116
00:16:43,015 --> 00:16:47,144
Returning to Yanchihe
across the Tumen River won't be easy.

117
00:16:55,068 --> 00:16:59,698
Woo, are you still upset with me?

118
00:17:00,741 --> 00:17:02,617
No use in being upset.

119
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:10,792
Damn it.

120
00:17:10,876 --> 00:17:13,712
I'll go down to the village
and see if I can get some food.

121
00:17:13,794 --> 00:17:15,379
I'll join you.

122
00:17:15,464 --> 00:17:17,299
Stay here and get some rest.

123
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,760
I'll be back soon.

124
00:17:21,845 --> 00:17:24,306
Grab some booze if you can.

125
00:17:27,267 --> 00:17:30,771
We should drink to our fallen comrades.

126
00:17:35,192 --> 00:17:36,735
Let's do that.

127
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:53,585
Prepare the cannon.

128
00:18:07,182 --> 00:18:09,851
How could you release an enemy leader,

129
00:18:11,895 --> 00:18:14,982
blinded by your sentimentality?

130
00:18:15,565 --> 00:18:19,820
If you were to capture
that Japanese officer again,

131
00:18:20,946 --> 00:18:22,406
would you make the same choice?

132
00:18:23,198 --> 00:18:24,157
Ahn Jung-geun.

133
00:18:25,325 --> 00:18:26,410
Answer him.

134
00:19:32,934 --> 00:19:35,687
He must be held responsible
for destroying our troops!

135
00:19:35,771 --> 00:19:38,607
- Absolutely!
- Yes! He must take responsibility!

136
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:40,734
Say something, goddamnit!

137
00:19:46,823 --> 00:19:49,660
- Prove your loyalty!
- You should resign!

138
00:19:50,535 --> 00:19:52,037
My dear comrades.

139
00:19:53,538 --> 00:19:57,668
Let's hear what he has to say
before we hold him accountable.

140
00:19:57,751 --> 00:19:59,336
Choi!

141
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,215
How can you take that man's side?

142
00:20:03,298 --> 00:20:06,218
Chang-sup, am I wrong?

143
00:20:22,484 --> 00:20:23,318
Comrade Ahn.

144
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:27,739
Why didn't you return immediately?
Answer that for me.

145
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:34,079
I took refuge in Hoeryong
and tried to cross the river,

146
00:20:35,998 --> 00:20:37,582
but I was faced with adversity.

147
00:20:40,262 --> 00:20:44,721
Tumen River, North Hamgyong Province.

148
00:21:07,988 --> 00:21:10,991
I was crossing the Tumen River,
going to Yanchihe,

149
00:21:12,409 --> 00:21:14,911
but I wasn't sure I could
make it back alive.

150
00:21:23,587 --> 00:21:27,716
The screams of dead comrades
wouldn't stop ringing in my ears,

151
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:32,137
and corpses with missing limbs

152
00:21:34,014 --> 00:21:37,017
floated before my eyes.

153
00:21:59,956 --> 00:22:03,085
I had lost my way.

154
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:09,216
Countless comrades had died
as a consequence of my principle.

155
00:22:09,341 --> 00:22:12,594
I couldn't think of a reason to go on.

156
00:22:15,973 --> 00:22:19,643
So I decided to give up on
everything and die.

157
00:22:21,019 --> 00:22:23,981
But at that very moment,
I had a realization.

158
00:22:31,029 --> 00:22:35,617
That my life belonged to my dead comrades.

159
00:22:38,495 --> 00:22:43,500
That I am living in place
of those fallen comrades.

160
00:22:44,209 --> 00:22:48,964
And I knew what I had to do.

161
00:23:05,647 --> 00:23:08,567
INDEPENDENCE FOR KOREA

162
00:23:12,112 --> 00:23:16,366
The leader of the Japanese wolves
ravaging all of Korea...

163
00:23:19,828 --> 00:23:21,997
I must kill that old wolf

164
00:23:23,832 --> 00:23:25,292
at all costs.

165
00:23:26,428 --> 00:23:28,628
Ito Hirobumi

166
00:23:28,962 --> 00:23:32,591
Considering the close ties
between Japan and Korea,

167
00:23:33,884 --> 00:23:36,428
to secure mutual happiness

168
00:23:36,511 --> 00:23:41,975
and establish permanent peace
in East Asia,

169
00:23:44,811 --> 00:23:49,775
we are convinced of the need
for Japan to absorb Korea,

170
00:23:50,901 --> 00:23:57,824
and thus we conclude
this treaty of annexation.

171
00:23:59,785 --> 00:24:03,622
42nd year of Meiji, October 16.

172
00:24:16,854 --> 00:24:21,526
Dalian, China, October 17, 1909.

173
00:24:23,569 --> 00:24:25,369
October 18th,
Ito Hirobumi arrives in Dalian

174
00:24:25,393 --> 00:24:26,593
26th at Harbin Station, Russia

175
00:24:26,617 --> 00:24:29,864
Discussing the Annexation of Korea by
Japan and the Korea-Japan Treaty of 1918.

176
00:24:51,837 --> 00:24:57,634
The ship carrying Ito Hirobumi will
arrive at Dalian Port at eight o'clock.

177
00:24:59,594 --> 00:25:00,929
Here's a Japanese ID.

178
00:25:07,644 --> 00:25:09,396
Your tickets, please.

179
00:25:22,743 --> 00:25:26,413
When you arrive at Dalian Port,
go to the store on the second floor.

180
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:31,043
Tell the owner you came from Vladivostok,
and he'll give you a gun.

181
00:25:32,294 --> 00:25:34,671
Did you write to your families?

182
00:25:45,849 --> 00:25:47,768
When the operation's over,

183
00:25:48,935 --> 00:25:52,064
go to the Daedong Gazette
office in Vladivostok.

184
00:25:52,814 --> 00:25:55,817
Mr. Choi Jae-hyung
will wait for you there.

185
00:25:58,278 --> 00:25:59,780
I wish you luck.

186
00:26:15,003 --> 00:26:17,756
They weren't dressed
like first-class passengers.

187
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:20,592
And I heard them speak Korean.

188
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:25,889
My hometown...

189
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,645
Must have been 20 years
since my mother died.

190
00:26:31,728 --> 00:26:33,605
Oh my.

191
00:26:34,147 --> 00:26:36,149
Then who'd you write to?

192
00:26:39,027 --> 00:26:40,487
A secret wife and child?

193
00:26:44,282 --> 00:26:46,284
I wish that were true.

194
00:26:48,745 --> 00:26:53,125
To live with a pretty wife and a child...

195
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:54,876
Would fate allow it?

196
00:26:57,254 --> 00:27:00,465
You can change your luck,
but not your fate.

197
00:27:02,092 --> 00:27:04,303
I'm not meant to have a family.

198
00:27:05,554 --> 00:27:07,222
Even so,

199
00:27:09,558 --> 00:27:14,438
a man must find a good partner
and start a family.

200
00:27:14,521 --> 00:27:16,273
Right.

201
00:27:16,356 --> 00:27:19,568
Is that why you abandoned your family
to come here?

202
00:27:22,654 --> 00:27:25,991
You got me there. I'm ashamed to admit it.

203
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:30,120
But what can I do?

204
00:27:31,663 --> 00:27:33,540
This is our fate.

205
00:27:48,138 --> 00:27:49,306
Are you Japanese?

206
00:27:50,349 --> 00:27:51,224
Yes.

207
00:27:54,186 --> 00:27:55,062
Your IDs?

208
00:28:35,018 --> 00:28:36,395
Where'd you come from?

209
00:28:36,478 --> 00:28:38,689
- From Fengtian.
- I'm asking him.

210
00:28:39,481 --> 00:28:40,774
Answer me.

211
00:28:41,775 --> 00:28:44,403
- Where'd you come from?
- We're together.

212
00:28:45,112 --> 00:28:46,697
We all came from Fengtian.

213
00:28:48,991 --> 00:28:50,450
Oda Gonnosuke.

214
00:28:52,202 --> 00:28:53,370
What is your destination?

215
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:55,080
Your age and profession?

216
00:29:01,962 --> 00:29:02,796
Come here.

217
00:29:37,706 --> 00:29:39,666
This way! Quickly!

218
00:29:40,417 --> 00:29:41,585
You go ahead.

219
00:29:42,836 --> 00:29:43,795
Go!

220
00:29:44,588 --> 00:29:45,464
Over here!

221
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:48,258
Clear the way!

222
00:29:53,013 --> 00:29:56,141
They planned to assassinate
His Excellency Ito at Dalian Port.

223
00:29:56,224 --> 00:29:59,019
- Koreans?
- Yes, they're all Koreans.

224
00:29:59,102 --> 00:30:02,272
Ahn Jung-geun is said to be among them.

225
00:30:03,106 --> 00:30:04,816
- Ahn Jung-geun?
- Yes, sir.

226
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,526
- Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.

227
00:30:21,259 --> 00:30:25,649
Vladivostok, Russia.

228
00:31:19,474 --> 00:31:21,643
Speak of the devil.

229
00:31:21,727 --> 00:31:23,562
Look who's here.

230
00:31:24,062 --> 00:31:26,189
What are you doing here?

231
00:31:26,273 --> 00:31:28,525
Have a seat, Comrade Ahn.

232
00:31:35,157 --> 00:31:36,867
Must have been through hell.

233
00:31:37,701 --> 00:31:39,661
I'm so sorry.

234
00:31:42,622 --> 00:31:44,833
Have comrades Woo and Kim arrived?

235
00:31:45,125 --> 00:31:47,586
Not yet. Haven't heard from them either.

236
00:32:16,156 --> 00:32:18,033
I had to evade the Japanese soldiers.

237
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,285
Are you hurt?

238
00:32:20,661 --> 00:32:23,538
I'm fine. What about Comrade Woo?

239
00:32:24,247 --> 00:32:26,166
Haven't heard from him.

240
00:32:28,669 --> 00:32:33,173
That's enough for the reunion,
let's plan our next move.

241
00:32:34,341 --> 00:32:38,679
Ito will board in Lushun,
travel through Dalian and Fengtian,

242
00:32:38,762 --> 00:32:41,932
and arrive in Changchun on the 25th.

243
00:32:42,724 --> 00:32:45,310
And he will make another transfer here.

244
00:32:45,602 --> 00:32:46,895
In Changchun?

245
00:32:47,479 --> 00:32:49,272
Changchun is the last station.

246
00:32:49,856 --> 00:32:52,109
From Lushun to Changchun
is the Japanese railway,

247
00:32:52,192 --> 00:32:55,612
and the one from Changchun to Harbin
belongs to Russia.

248
00:32:56,113 --> 00:32:59,116
Because the width of
the railways is different,

249
00:32:59,199 --> 00:33:01,368
a special train will be sent from Russia.

250
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:05,497
Then he'll arrive here
in Harbin on the 26th.

251
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:08,083
Yes, in a week.

252
00:33:08,625 --> 00:33:09,876
Good.

253
00:33:11,378 --> 00:33:13,046
We'll take him out in Harbin.

254
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:15,048
What are you doing?

255
00:33:17,634 --> 00:33:21,638
As far as I'm aware,
Ahn is the leader of this operation.

256
00:33:22,222 --> 00:33:23,807
Look, Comrade Kim.

257
00:33:24,808 --> 00:33:28,103
Jung-geun has already
been exposed to the enemy.

258
00:33:29,271 --> 00:33:33,650
You really think he is fit
to be leading this operation?

259
00:33:35,444 --> 00:33:37,446
Lee has a point there.

260
00:33:37,529 --> 00:33:41,199
Chang-sup should be
in charge of the operation now.

261
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:45,996
Ahn, what do you think?

262
00:33:50,417 --> 00:33:51,710
I understand.

263
00:33:54,046 --> 00:33:58,550
Thank you for saying that.
My heart is more at ease.

264
00:34:00,594 --> 00:34:03,847
Also, there's something
I'd like you to take care of.

265
00:34:07,601 --> 00:34:09,311
Find us explosives.

266
00:34:12,814 --> 00:34:15,066
You may be one hell of a shot,

267
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:17,611
but it'll be impossible to kill Ito
with just a gun.

268
00:34:18,653 --> 00:34:20,113
Isn't that right?

269
00:34:22,949 --> 00:34:24,993
Find us those explosives,

270
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,372
I'll finish Ito with my own hands.

271
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:32,699
7 days before the event.

272
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,635
Lushun, China.

273
00:34:35,211 --> 00:34:38,340
It is an honor to accompany you to Harbin.

274
00:34:38,798 --> 00:34:41,218
I heard there was an incident.

275
00:34:42,218 --> 00:34:43,679
My apologies.

276
00:34:44,554 --> 00:34:47,265
One of the most capable officers
of the Kanto Provincial government

277
00:34:47,932 --> 00:34:49,476
is investigating the matter.

278
00:34:51,728 --> 00:34:53,522
Who is after me?

279
00:34:53,604 --> 00:34:55,065
We are looking into it.

280
00:34:55,857 --> 00:35:00,862
And we have heightened our security
just in case.

281
00:35:01,905 --> 00:35:05,158
We've also canceled the greeting event
at Harbin Station.

282
00:35:05,492 --> 00:35:08,078
It would be better
if you arrived unannounced.

283
00:35:08,662 --> 00:35:09,496
No.

284
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:12,958
We'll hold the event as planned.

285
00:35:13,625 --> 00:35:14,501
Sir?

286
00:35:17,504 --> 00:35:21,925
Opting out of these events
is exactly what these men want from me.

287
00:35:23,051 --> 00:35:26,722
We will proceed as planned.

288
00:35:29,182 --> 00:35:30,475
Yamada.

289
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:31,977
Yes, Your Excellency?

290
00:35:32,978 --> 00:35:37,941
You know why I've always been
skeptical about annexing Korea?

291
00:35:39,735 --> 00:35:43,322
For centuries,
the nation of Korea has been...

292
00:35:44,489 --> 00:35:51,330
ruled by foolish kings
and corrupt scholars.

293
00:35:53,165 --> 00:35:58,962
But Korea's common people
are the most troublesome.

294
00:36:00,922 --> 00:36:03,216
Even for a nation
that's given them nothing,

295
00:36:04,051 --> 00:36:07,929
in times of national crisis,
they wield a strange power.

296
00:36:10,891 --> 00:36:12,517
300 years ago,

297
00:36:13,644 --> 00:36:19,149
Hideyoshi's invasion was stopped by men
who volunteered to fight for the nation.

298
00:36:21,985 --> 00:36:27,658
The same is happening today in Manchuria.

299
00:36:30,952 --> 00:36:37,959
We have poured so much money into Korea.

300
00:36:41,797 --> 00:36:48,470
But the grassroots are still
hostile towards Japan.

301
00:36:53,058 --> 00:36:55,185
I'm not sure what to do.

302
00:36:56,770 --> 00:36:59,314
300 years ago,
there was Admiral Yi Sun-sin.

303
00:37:00,148 --> 00:37:03,819
I'm not sure such a hero
lives today in Korea.

304
00:37:29,428 --> 00:37:30,554
Thank you, ma'am.

305
00:37:30,637 --> 00:37:32,764
I won't forget your kindness.

306
00:37:33,724 --> 00:37:35,726
Follow me.

307
00:37:41,273 --> 00:37:43,400
Let's stay here for now.

308
00:37:44,234 --> 00:37:49,364
And keep this place
a secret from our comrades.

309
00:37:50,407 --> 00:37:53,827
Vladivostok may be on Russian soil,

310
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:56,455
but the Japanese have eyes
all over the place.

311
00:37:57,456 --> 00:38:03,712
And don't be too let down
about Chang-sup being the leader.

312
00:38:07,132 --> 00:38:09,176
You think Woo is okay?

313
00:38:10,093 --> 00:38:11,511
Let's wait.

314
00:38:12,512 --> 00:38:14,973
Wait just a bit longer.

315
00:38:18,477 --> 00:38:20,937
How will you get the explosives?

316
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:30,280
I think we need the help of Ms. Gong.

317
00:38:31,323 --> 00:38:32,574
Ms. Gong...

318
00:38:33,742 --> 00:38:36,453
Yes, I heard she had connections
with Chinese warlords.

319
00:38:37,412 --> 00:38:39,289
Might not be so hard after all.

320
00:38:39,873 --> 00:38:41,541
Have you seen her recently?

321
00:38:42,376 --> 00:38:43,835
Not since three years ago.

322
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:48,423
That's when she lost her husband.

323
00:38:49,091 --> 00:38:51,718
You fought with him in Musan, correct?

324
00:38:52,886 --> 00:38:54,596
She fought alongside us too.

325
00:38:55,681 --> 00:38:57,724
If it weren't for her,

326
00:38:58,684 --> 00:39:01,687
even more comrades
would have lost their lives.

327
00:39:04,398 --> 00:39:07,192
We should've at least secured his body.

328
00:39:23,041 --> 00:39:25,544
I've heard news about you
from time to time.

329
00:39:26,712 --> 00:39:28,797
You were in Yanchihe.

330
00:39:29,381 --> 00:39:32,259
The wind's been taking me here and there.

331
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:35,595
I'm sure you're here for a reason.

332
00:39:37,723 --> 00:39:41,059
I need enough explosives
to destroy a train car.

333
00:39:42,436 --> 00:39:46,315
It's difficult to find
that much in Vladivostok.

334
00:39:47,858 --> 00:39:49,484
I'll need a few days.

335
00:39:50,986 --> 00:39:52,487
There's no time.

336
00:39:55,532 --> 00:39:59,911
Then tomorrow,
come with me to Sangmok Village.

337
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:04,291
Comrade Park Jeom-chul is there.

338
00:40:05,542 --> 00:40:07,252
Jeom-chul is here?

339
00:40:08,545 --> 00:40:10,881
He's become a bandit now.

340
00:40:12,049 --> 00:40:15,844
Our agents say it's a small
newspaper company in Vladivostok.

341
00:40:15,927 --> 00:40:18,430
The newspaper was launched
by a Korean named Choi Jae-hyung,

342
00:40:18,513 --> 00:40:22,225
but he is of Russian nationality,
so we must be cautious.

343
00:40:22,309 --> 00:40:25,520
Vladivostok is ruled by Russia,
so to move on anti-Japanese forces,

344
00:40:25,604 --> 00:40:28,398
we need the Russians' cooperation.

345
00:40:29,399 --> 00:40:30,901
What is this newspaper called?

346
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:33,195
The Daedong Gazette.

347
00:40:34,071 --> 00:40:35,739
When you land in Vladivostok,

348
00:40:35,822 --> 00:40:37,699
cooperate with the Russian army.

349
00:40:38,408 --> 00:40:39,618
Very well, sir.

350
00:40:49,086 --> 00:40:50,587
I'm off the booze.

351
00:40:53,465 --> 00:40:55,300
You've given up alcohol?

352
00:40:55,884 --> 00:40:57,803
Like a dog would give up eating shit.

353
00:41:00,347 --> 00:41:04,059
When we finally get our independence,
I'll have a drink with you.

354
00:41:11,942 --> 00:41:14,403
You think we'll survive that long?

355
00:41:25,998 --> 00:41:27,457
If I go first,

356
00:41:29,418 --> 00:41:34,381
pour a glass on my grave.

357
00:41:37,426 --> 00:41:40,304
I doubt I'll live any longer.

358
00:41:41,722 --> 00:41:43,140
Have a drink.

359
00:42:00,407 --> 00:42:02,617
- Woo, you're alive.
- Ahn?

360
00:42:05,329 --> 00:42:06,705
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

361
00:42:07,748 --> 00:42:08,957
Just starving.

362
00:42:10,125 --> 00:42:11,960
Let's get something to eat first.

363
00:42:21,303 --> 00:42:24,181
Why do you still look like
you've seen a ghost?

364
00:42:25,307 --> 00:42:26,600
Don't make this weird.

365
00:42:32,356 --> 00:42:34,316
That hit the spot.

366
00:42:34,858 --> 00:42:38,028
But what are you doing here, Lee?

367
00:42:39,196 --> 00:42:42,407
Lee will be in charge of this operation
from this point on.

368
00:42:43,075 --> 00:42:44,660
What?

369
00:42:45,327 --> 00:42:46,328
I gotta say,

370
00:42:47,663 --> 00:42:49,581
I don't know how I feel about that.

371
00:42:49,998 --> 00:42:51,124
It's already decided.

372
00:42:51,875 --> 00:42:55,003
But Comrade Ahn started this.

373
00:42:57,130 --> 00:42:59,883
He should be the one to see it through.

374
00:43:00,592 --> 00:43:04,137
I wouldn't be here if he could.

375
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:05,847
That's fine and all,

376
00:43:06,765 --> 00:43:09,851
but where on earth have you been?

377
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:17,192
Don't get me started.

378
00:43:18,902 --> 00:43:21,071
I took the wrong train.

379
00:43:22,447 --> 00:43:25,534
I meant to take the train
to Vladivostok at Caijiagou Station,

380
00:43:26,243 --> 00:43:28,370
but I ended up on a train to Changchun.

381
00:43:29,329 --> 00:43:30,706
So I ran a bit late.

382
00:43:31,999 --> 00:43:33,709
Can't believe you survived.

383
00:43:37,379 --> 00:43:38,296
What the...

384
00:43:39,506 --> 00:43:41,299
What's that supposed to mean?

385
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:46,221
Woo, you must be tired.
You should get some rest.

386
00:43:46,471 --> 00:43:48,348
Show him to his room, Kim.

387
00:43:49,308 --> 00:43:50,976
All right.

388
00:43:52,352 --> 00:43:54,104
Let's go, then.

389
00:43:57,691 --> 00:43:59,985
Kim, let's have a drink before turning in.

390
00:44:01,528 --> 00:44:03,030
Aren't you tired?

391
00:44:04,781 --> 00:44:07,909
I'll need a drink to fall asleep.

392
00:44:12,331 --> 00:44:16,209
Let's leave Woo out of this operation.

393
00:44:17,169 --> 00:44:19,212
What do you mean?

394
00:44:20,422 --> 00:44:22,132
Do you really think we can trust Woo?

395
00:44:22,716 --> 00:44:26,053
You don't think he's become a spy, do you?

396
00:44:26,637 --> 00:44:27,929
Don't you think

397
00:44:28,764 --> 00:44:31,767
the Japanese could have
caught him on the run?

398
00:44:33,518 --> 00:44:35,103
Let's not jump to conclusions.

399
00:44:38,231 --> 00:44:39,650
Listen, Chang-sup.

400
00:44:41,693 --> 00:44:44,321
Don't go throwing around wild accusations

401
00:44:45,197 --> 00:44:47,240
without a shred of evidence.

402
00:44:48,784 --> 00:44:51,870
The same naivety led you
to free the enemy commander.

403
00:44:52,454 --> 00:44:53,955
Listen, Jung-geun.

404
00:44:55,248 --> 00:45:00,629
The independence movement
is not child's play.

405
00:45:01,213 --> 00:45:02,547
Grow up.

406
00:45:05,175 --> 00:45:07,844
What do you two think?

407
00:45:09,096 --> 00:45:11,556
If Woo is out, I'm out too.

408
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,308
Ahn Jung-geun!

409
00:45:16,019 --> 00:45:18,480
Don't let your feelings
interfere with the operation.

410
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,192
If you can't trust your comrades,

411
00:45:23,402 --> 00:45:26,154
this operation will never succeed.

412
00:45:28,448 --> 00:45:29,783
Kim.

413
00:45:32,828 --> 00:45:34,496
You think we'll get our independence?

414
00:45:38,834 --> 00:45:42,337
If Japan writes history,
no one will remember us.

415
00:45:53,557 --> 00:45:57,019
We gotta punch above our weight.

416
00:46:00,022 --> 00:46:03,275
Even if I die, I want my name to live on.

417
00:46:05,777 --> 00:46:07,988
You're an ambitious one, aren't you, Kim?

418
00:46:11,283 --> 00:46:12,951
Are you not?

419
00:46:16,121 --> 00:46:18,749
I don't give a crap about that.

420
00:46:19,374 --> 00:46:20,917
When you're dead, you're dead.

421
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:24,504
Who cares if anyone remembers us?

422
00:46:27,049 --> 00:46:29,426
Then why fight for independence?

423
00:46:32,137 --> 00:46:34,389
When I was young,

424
00:46:36,933 --> 00:46:39,478
all these nobles would
treat me like crap all the time,

425
00:46:41,063 --> 00:46:45,233
and I'd always curse the nation,
wishing it'd all go to shit.

426
00:46:48,153 --> 00:46:49,946
But I had no idea

427
00:46:50,989 --> 00:46:52,699
that it actually would.

428
00:46:59,164 --> 00:47:01,917
Now I wish I'd watched my damn mouth.

429
00:47:04,294 --> 00:47:05,337
Woo.

430
00:47:07,881 --> 00:47:11,093
You don't really think
you cursed the country to shit, do you?

431
00:47:25,232 --> 00:47:26,858
Thank you.

432
00:47:28,026 --> 00:47:29,361
What for?

433
00:47:30,904 --> 00:47:33,281
I wouldn't be here sitting with you

434
00:47:34,783 --> 00:47:38,036
if you didn't save my ass
in the Battle of Shinasan.

435
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:46,044
Would have done the same
for any of our comrades.

436
00:47:47,921 --> 00:47:49,673
I'm still grateful.

437
00:48:00,851 --> 00:48:05,063
If that's how you feel,
you can pay me back by saving my life.

438
00:48:10,193 --> 00:48:11,611
I will.

439
00:48:12,362 --> 00:48:13,739
You have my word.

440
00:48:15,949 --> 00:48:18,493
I'll save your life one of these days.

441
00:48:19,294 --> 00:48:21,654
5 days before the event.

442
00:48:22,257 --> 00:48:24,567
Fengtian, China.

443
00:48:25,751 --> 00:48:28,211
Any word about the men targeting me?

444
00:48:29,171 --> 00:48:34,176
As I've said, sir, Lt. General Mori
is working hard on the investigation.

445
00:48:34,676 --> 00:48:36,178
You haven't caught them?

446
00:48:37,721 --> 00:48:39,014
I'm afraid not.

447
00:48:43,852 --> 00:48:45,729
What fools.

448
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:52,069
In my three years here,

449
00:48:53,362 --> 00:48:56,073
Korea has seen more development

450
00:48:56,156 --> 00:49:00,619
than it ever would have in centuries
under Confucian rule.

451
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:08,585
And they dare attack me?

452
00:49:31,191 --> 00:49:33,235
How have you been, Ms. Gong?

453
00:49:34,111 --> 00:49:35,946
Long time no see, Comrade.

454
00:49:38,281 --> 00:49:40,450
This is Comrade Kim Sang-hyun.

455
00:49:40,534 --> 00:49:42,661
Pleasure to meet you. I'm Kim Sang-hyun.

456
00:49:43,203 --> 00:49:45,163
I've heard a lot about you.

457
00:49:46,289 --> 00:49:48,250
Let's get going, shall we?

458
00:50:13,784 --> 00:50:18,422
Manchuria, China.

459
00:52:23,488 --> 00:52:25,949
How much further to Sangmok Village?

460
00:52:26,283 --> 00:52:29,077
We'll arrive by early evening tomorrow.

461
00:52:32,914 --> 00:52:37,461
Is Jeom-chul really a bandit now?

462
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:43,884
He leads the largest ring
of bandits in Jilin.

463
00:52:48,889 --> 00:52:54,561
He was fuming about the plot of land
the Japanese stole from him.

464
00:52:56,146 --> 00:52:58,190
How did he end up a bandit?

465
00:52:59,483 --> 00:53:03,820
I used to look up to the guy.

466
00:53:04,404 --> 00:53:07,908
Long ago,
all of this land used to be ours.

467
00:53:10,202 --> 00:53:11,578
So much for that now.

468
00:53:12,412 --> 00:53:14,581
There's not a patch of land
we can rest easy on.

469
00:53:16,291 --> 00:53:18,543
That's old news.

470
00:53:22,464 --> 00:53:24,299
It's quite chilly, isn't it?

471
00:54:15,434 --> 00:54:17,185
So good to see you.

472
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:28,280
Ito has come to Manchuria.

473
00:54:28,947 --> 00:54:31,491
He's here to seal the deal
on the annexation.

474
00:54:32,075 --> 00:54:35,454
We couldn't just sit and watch.

475
00:54:36,455 --> 00:54:37,914
Speaking of...

476
00:54:39,207 --> 00:54:41,418
We need some explosives.

477
00:54:41,877 --> 00:54:42,919
Yes.

478
00:54:43,628 --> 00:54:48,550
If you give us enough
to blow up a train car,

479
00:54:49,217 --> 00:54:51,136
I think we can eliminate Ito.

480
00:54:51,219 --> 00:54:52,346
Jeom-chul.

481
00:54:53,513 --> 00:54:55,432
It's for the independence of our nation.

482
00:54:57,142 --> 00:54:58,977
You and I...

483
00:55:03,357 --> 00:55:04,608
fought alongside...

484
00:55:09,988 --> 00:55:12,115
my brother in Musan.

485
00:55:14,826 --> 00:55:17,412
How many more deaths will it take?

486
00:55:29,257 --> 00:55:32,344
It's good to see old comrades.

487
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:35,847
I feel like a real saint.

488
00:55:42,521 --> 00:55:43,563
Very well.

489
00:55:48,402 --> 00:55:50,112
Let's make a bet.

490
00:55:51,321 --> 00:55:52,364
So...

491
00:55:53,657 --> 00:55:55,492
this is a game

492
00:55:56,410 --> 00:55:58,745
the Russians call "roulette."

493
00:56:03,166 --> 00:56:04,918
You put the gun to your head.

494
00:56:06,044 --> 00:56:07,295
And you and the opponent...

495
00:56:09,214 --> 00:56:12,843
take turns pulling the trigger.

496
00:56:13,677 --> 00:56:18,140
If you survive roulette,
I'll give you the explosives.

497
00:56:18,932 --> 00:56:19,891
Jeom-chul...

498
00:56:19,975 --> 00:56:21,226
What do you think?

499
00:56:23,812 --> 00:56:25,522
Give it a go, Jung-geun.

500
00:56:26,273 --> 00:56:27,190
Well?

501
00:56:29,026 --> 00:56:30,986
How about you, Woo?

502
00:56:31,445 --> 00:56:33,113
- Well?
- Calm down, Jeom-chul.

503
00:56:33,822 --> 00:56:36,867
What about Mr. Meek over here?

504
00:56:42,205 --> 00:56:44,374
I thought you were freedom fighters.

505
00:56:45,584 --> 00:56:47,127
Where are your balls?

506
00:56:52,299 --> 00:56:54,343
What a fat load of crap!

507
00:56:57,095 --> 00:56:59,598
I'll be damned if you boys succeed.

508
00:57:03,310 --> 00:57:06,063
Even my good eye is getting blurry.

509
00:57:07,856 --> 00:57:09,399
I guess it won't be long

510
00:57:12,235 --> 00:57:14,905
until I don't have to see
this filthy world anymore.

511
00:57:15,489 --> 00:57:18,533
- Jeom-chul.
- Park Jeom-chul, you bastard!

512
00:57:22,245 --> 00:57:26,875
Don't let your comrades' deaths
be in vain.

513
00:57:29,670 --> 00:57:35,384
How long will you sit here
drinking your life away?

514
00:57:36,677 --> 00:57:37,928
In Musan,

515
00:57:39,596 --> 00:57:40,806
I lost an eye...

516
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:44,393
and my brother.

517
00:57:48,522 --> 00:57:54,236
Don't you hear the wailing
of your dead comrades?

518
00:58:06,123 --> 00:58:08,542
I'm sorry I couldn't save your husband.

519
00:58:13,672 --> 00:58:14,840
I wish...

520
00:58:16,258 --> 00:58:18,093
I was the one who died

521
00:58:19,344 --> 00:58:21,388
and my brother had lived.

522
00:58:25,559 --> 00:58:26,935
Jeom-chul.

523
00:58:29,313 --> 00:58:30,981
Please give us the explosives.

524
00:58:40,407 --> 00:58:44,953
It seems I've lost my way.

525
00:59:01,595 --> 00:59:04,556
Give them the explosives.

526
00:59:43,979 --> 00:59:46,509
3 days before the event.

527
00:59:47,232 --> 00:59:50,265
Vladivostok,
Daedong Public Relations Office.

528
00:59:54,189 --> 00:59:55,732
The Russian soldiers are here.

529
00:59:56,358 --> 00:59:57,693
- Stand by.
- Yes, sir.

530
01:00:03,407 --> 01:00:05,242
Where should we take the explosives?

531
01:00:05,325 --> 01:00:06,702
To Harbin.

532
01:00:06,785 --> 01:00:08,954
Ito arrives in Harbin in three days.

533
01:00:09,246 --> 01:00:10,914
Security in Harbin will be airtight.

534
01:00:11,039 --> 01:00:15,127
It'd be easier to strike in Changchun,
where Ito will transfer.

535
01:00:15,210 --> 01:00:16,920
Kim is right.

536
01:00:17,671 --> 01:00:19,006
Let's go to Changchun.

537
01:00:19,089 --> 01:00:21,425
Ito will be in Changchun in two days.

538
01:00:21,508 --> 01:00:23,760
It'd take two days for us to get there.

539
01:00:24,511 --> 01:00:26,847
We won't have time
to prepare in Changchun.

540
01:00:27,848 --> 01:00:29,224
We have three days.

541
01:00:29,308 --> 01:00:32,060
I'm set on Harbin.
Let's just stick to the plan.

542
01:00:32,185 --> 01:00:34,313
Look for Kim Seong-baek
once you get to Harbin.

543
01:00:34,438 --> 01:00:35,522
Who is that?

544
01:00:35,605 --> 01:00:38,900
Head of the Korean Association there.
He said he'd accommodate us.

545
01:00:39,526 --> 01:00:41,820
Why don't you stay behind, Ms. Gong?

546
01:00:42,571 --> 01:00:45,365
You've done your part.
We have the explosives.

547
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:49,286
I will come with you to Harbin.

548
01:00:49,953 --> 01:00:52,331
It's an unnecessary risk for you to take.

549
01:00:52,789 --> 01:00:53,957
Stay here.

550
01:00:54,041 --> 01:00:56,376
Harbin is under Russian jurisdiction.

551
01:00:56,543 --> 01:00:59,171
Does anyone here speak
Russian better than I do?

552
01:00:59,755 --> 01:01:01,214
She's right.

553
01:01:01,298 --> 01:01:05,594
Mr. Choi must stay here,
so it's better for her to join us.

554
01:01:08,305 --> 01:01:12,100
Let's move.
There's a train for Harbin in an hour.

555
01:01:12,726 --> 01:01:14,603
Let's go.

556
01:01:36,124 --> 01:01:37,376
Shall we strike now?

557
01:01:37,668 --> 01:01:38,835
Wait.

558
01:01:39,503 --> 01:01:41,421
I don't see Ahn Jung-geun yet.

559
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:47,636
It's an ambush.

560
01:01:47,719 --> 01:01:49,596
- Certainly.
- I saw it too.

561
01:01:53,934 --> 01:01:57,229
We'll cover you. Take Ms. Gong with you.

562
01:01:57,354 --> 01:01:58,271
Jung-geun.

563
01:02:04,987 --> 01:02:06,947
You started this operation.

564
01:02:17,958 --> 01:02:19,543
I'll strike first.

565
01:02:20,085 --> 01:02:21,670
I'll hit them from the other side.

566
01:02:21,837 --> 01:02:23,839
And I'll cover you from above.

567
01:02:23,922 --> 01:02:25,841
Ms. Gong will drive the carriage.

568
01:02:25,924 --> 01:02:27,259
I'll cover you from behind.

569
01:02:27,342 --> 01:02:28,510
Very well.

570
01:03:59,851 --> 01:04:00,936
Lt. General.

571
01:04:01,019 --> 01:04:03,021
We caught one of them.

572
01:04:50,986 --> 01:04:52,821
Where is Ahn Jung-geun?

573
01:04:53,697 --> 01:04:57,576
Talk, and I'll spare your life.

574
01:04:57,659 --> 01:04:59,161
Where is Ahn Jung-geun?

575
01:04:59,244 --> 01:05:02,414
If you tell us where he is,
we'll spare your life.

576
01:05:04,666 --> 01:05:06,001
Morons.

577
01:05:28,065 --> 01:05:29,941
Where is Ahn Jung-geun?

578
01:05:31,443 --> 01:05:33,153
Don't you remember me?

579
01:05:35,697 --> 01:05:41,078
I wanted to kill you,
but Jung-geun spared your life.

580
01:05:43,121 --> 01:05:45,165
I should've killed you then.

581
01:05:51,546 --> 01:05:52,839
I'll ask again.

582
01:05:54,966 --> 01:05:56,718
Where is Ahn Jung-geun?

583
01:05:59,846 --> 01:06:01,223
Ahn Jung-geun...

584
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:04,476
Ahn Jung-geun, Ahn Jung-geun.

585
01:06:07,479 --> 01:06:10,691
You just can't stop talking
about Ahn Jung-geun.

586
01:06:13,026 --> 01:06:13,986
I know.

587
01:06:15,487 --> 01:06:18,532
You don't give a crap
about Ito's assassination.

588
01:06:19,491 --> 01:06:22,160
You just want to catch Ahn Jung-geun.

589
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:25,914
Figures.

590
01:06:28,125 --> 01:06:32,129
You had to beg
someone beneath you for your life.

591
01:06:33,088 --> 01:06:35,257
No wonder you want to kill him.

592
01:06:39,094 --> 01:06:41,096
But guess what?

593
01:06:42,597 --> 01:06:47,060
Ahn Jung-geun is
a thousand times more virtuous

594
01:06:47,144 --> 01:06:48,645
than a piece of shit like you.

595
01:06:57,321 --> 01:06:59,323
So you knew.

596
01:07:07,247 --> 01:07:08,707
You moron.

597
01:07:32,689 --> 01:07:34,650
What happened to the others?

598
01:07:36,610 --> 01:07:38,570
They've all scattered.

599
01:07:39,196 --> 01:07:40,906
I think we have a mole.

600
01:07:41,740 --> 01:07:43,909
They waited for us
to get the explosives to attack.

601
01:07:43,992 --> 01:07:45,577
To catch all of us.

602
01:07:46,328 --> 01:07:47,537
Listen, Jung-geun.

603
01:07:49,581 --> 01:07:53,210
Let's cancel this operation
and seek another opportunity.

604
01:07:54,711 --> 01:07:57,839
No, we can't stop now.

605
01:07:57,923 --> 01:08:00,467
With a mole in the midst,
there's no way we can succeed.

606
01:08:00,550 --> 01:08:02,844
We must continue.

607
01:08:04,096 --> 01:08:06,431
Your comrades' lives
rest on your decision!

608
01:08:06,515 --> 01:08:09,059
There's no guarantee
Ito will ever return to Manchuria.

609
01:08:09,142 --> 01:08:11,436
You could get all of us killed!

610
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:14,940
We'll have gotten nothing done
if we don't see this through!

611
01:08:37,212 --> 01:08:38,755
So many...

612
01:08:45,137 --> 01:08:48,223
So many of our comrades have died.

613
01:08:52,853 --> 01:08:56,605
I'm scared we'll lose even more.

614
01:09:01,945 --> 01:09:05,073
Yes, so call this off.

615
01:09:05,741 --> 01:09:06,616
Nobody...

616
01:09:07,909 --> 01:09:09,994
Nobody will point their finger at you.

617
01:09:18,253 --> 01:09:21,172
But what about our dead comrades?

618
01:09:31,433 --> 01:09:32,809
Sir.

619
01:09:36,938 --> 01:09:38,899
If we don't draw blood,

620
01:09:40,150 --> 01:09:42,569
no one will remember them.

621
01:10:09,691 --> 01:10:12,284
2 days before the event.

622
01:10:23,902 --> 01:10:25,612
I come from Vladivostok.

623
01:10:26,071 --> 01:10:27,280
I'm Kim Seong-baek.

624
01:10:33,169 --> 01:10:37,826
Harbin, Safe house.

625
01:10:50,095 --> 01:10:51,722
What happened to Ahn?

626
01:10:53,181 --> 01:10:55,642
- I don't know.
- And the explosives?

627
01:11:07,946 --> 01:11:09,614
Change of plans.

628
01:11:09,698 --> 01:11:13,452
We're going to Caijiagou Station,
not Harbin.

629
01:11:14,161 --> 01:11:16,747
We'll take the train.

630
01:11:18,457 --> 01:11:20,042
And Ahn?

631
01:11:21,335 --> 01:11:22,669
Where is he?

632
01:11:24,004 --> 01:11:25,839
He's waiting at Caijiagou Station.

633
01:11:26,757 --> 01:11:28,508
Listen, Mori.

634
01:11:28,592 --> 01:11:31,345
We don't have much to do here.

635
01:11:31,428 --> 01:11:34,389
Harbin is under Russian jurisdiction.

636
01:11:35,307 --> 01:11:36,808
And on the day Ito arrives,

637
01:11:37,309 --> 01:11:40,228
the Russian Army will swarm over
Harbin Station like bees.

638
01:11:40,312 --> 01:11:41,772
That's not enough.

639
01:11:41,855 --> 01:11:43,815
Close every train station
he passes through,

640
01:11:43,899 --> 01:11:45,734
and bar any civilian entry.

641
01:11:45,817 --> 01:11:47,069
Actually,

642
01:11:47,152 --> 01:11:50,072
Ito himself has
issued orders regarding that.

643
01:11:50,155 --> 01:11:51,365
All scheduled events

644
01:11:51,448 --> 01:11:53,158
will proceed as planned.

645
01:11:53,241 --> 01:11:54,326
Consul.

646
01:11:54,409 --> 01:11:56,411
Are you certain those were his orders?

647
01:11:56,495 --> 01:11:58,205
How many times must I say it?

648
01:11:58,288 --> 01:12:00,916
Besides, canceling His Excellency's plans

649
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:03,293
because of one Korean man?

650
01:12:03,377 --> 01:12:06,254
That doesn't make much sense, does it?

651
01:12:09,216 --> 01:12:12,469
You planted a mole?

652
01:12:12,844 --> 01:12:13,679
Yes.

653
01:12:16,473 --> 01:12:19,393
The Short Finger Alliance...

654
01:12:22,145 --> 01:12:23,647
What was his name again?

655
01:12:24,398 --> 01:12:25,691
Ahn Jung-geun.

656
01:12:29,111 --> 01:12:34,616
This isn't just about
catching Ahn Jung-geun.

657
01:12:34,700 --> 01:12:36,702
I understand.

658
01:12:37,786 --> 01:12:40,872
We'll be sure to eliminate
the entire group.

659
01:12:50,424 --> 01:12:51,591
They're here.

660
01:13:48,690 --> 01:13:49,941
Which carriage?

661
01:13:51,485 --> 01:13:53,070
Number two.

662
01:13:57,449 --> 01:13:59,743
Ito arrives in Harbin tomorrow.

663
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:02,788
To succeed, we must find the mole.

664
01:14:03,705 --> 01:14:07,292
There will definitely be a meeting.
Did you tell them the location?

665
01:14:08,210 --> 01:14:11,213
I told all three the operation
was to take place in Caijiagou.

666
01:14:14,758 --> 01:14:19,012
Let's wait and see which one the mole is.

667
01:17:50,682 --> 01:17:52,517
Are you sure it's at Caijiagou Station?

668
01:17:53,268 --> 01:17:54,102
Yes.

669
01:17:55,437 --> 01:17:56,521
And Ahn Jung-geun?

670
01:17:57,230 --> 01:18:00,359
He's waiting at Caijiagou Station.

671
01:18:19,586 --> 01:18:20,587
Get him!

672
01:18:21,129 --> 01:18:22,214
Stop or we'll shoot!

673
01:18:23,173 --> 01:18:24,424
Get him!

674
01:19:08,093 --> 01:19:09,636
Where is Ahn Jung-geun?

675
01:19:11,054 --> 01:19:12,472
I don't know.

676
01:19:13,932 --> 01:19:17,477
We agreed to meet up in Vladivostok.

677
01:19:31,116 --> 01:19:33,368
Save me.

678
01:19:36,455 --> 01:19:37,664
Please.

679
01:19:38,832 --> 01:19:43,086
I'll do whatever you want.

680
01:20:02,606 --> 01:20:03,523
Eat.

681
01:20:09,946 --> 01:20:10,989
I said, eat.

682
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:27,756
Taste good?

683
01:20:34,054 --> 01:20:35,305
Then tell me.

684
01:20:38,850 --> 01:20:40,352
Where is Ahn Jung-geun?

685
01:20:42,771 --> 01:20:44,022
I really don't know.

686
01:20:44,439 --> 01:20:45,607
I did as I was told.

687
01:20:46,483 --> 01:20:50,070
It's not my fault you couldn't get him.

688
01:20:53,323 --> 01:20:55,325
Where in Harbin will you meet?

689
01:20:55,909 --> 01:20:57,953
We're to look for a Kim Seong-baek.

690
01:20:59,454 --> 01:21:00,288
Really?

691
01:21:01,915 --> 01:21:03,166
Who is that?

692
01:21:04,543 --> 01:21:06,545
The head of Harbin's Korean Association.

693
01:21:07,170 --> 01:21:08,922
Will all of you meet there?

694
01:21:14,678 --> 01:21:15,929
Go to Harbin.

695
01:21:25,105 --> 01:21:26,356
It's not looking good for him.

696
01:21:29,693 --> 01:21:31,903
Will Ahn Jung-geun really go to Harbin?

697
01:21:32,446 --> 01:21:34,614
He will never give up.

698
01:21:35,198 --> 01:21:39,453
Go to Harbin
and find out what he's planning.

699
01:21:42,581 --> 01:21:43,832
I will.

700
01:21:56,928 --> 01:21:57,929
Eat.

701
01:23:04,496 --> 01:23:05,706
Hey, Kim.

702
01:23:07,749 --> 01:23:09,209
How much longer to Caijiagou?

703
01:23:12,754 --> 01:23:14,172
About an hour.

704
01:23:17,009 --> 01:23:18,593
Where did Ms. Gong go?

705
01:23:21,179 --> 01:23:23,098
She got off at Wujia.

706
01:23:24,933 --> 01:23:27,019
She won't take part in this operation.

707
01:23:27,102 --> 01:23:29,771
You know, her husband...

708
01:23:30,897 --> 01:23:34,609
fought alongside Ahn in Musan.

709
01:23:37,654 --> 01:23:41,033
They never even recovered his body.

710
01:23:41,116 --> 01:23:42,492
After all that,

711
01:23:44,953 --> 01:23:47,289
we can't lose Ms. Gong too, can we?

712
01:24:22,658 --> 01:24:24,284
Did you find the mole?

713
01:24:27,287 --> 01:24:28,330
Yes.

714
01:24:30,123 --> 01:24:31,249
Who is it?

715
01:24:31,541 --> 01:24:33,627
Kim Sang-hyun.

716
01:24:37,214 --> 01:24:39,132
What will you do with him?

717
01:24:41,927 --> 01:24:44,471
Comrade Woo will deal with him.

718
01:24:46,565 --> 01:24:49,382
1 day before the event.

719
01:24:51,979 --> 01:24:53,146
Who are they?

720
01:24:55,732 --> 01:24:57,359
Railroad guards.

721
01:24:57,859 --> 01:24:59,987
Russian soldiers
take shifts guarding the place.

722
01:25:00,529 --> 01:25:01,905
Where's Ahn?

723
01:25:02,864 --> 01:25:04,074
Follow me.

724
01:25:22,926 --> 01:25:24,136
How did it go?

725
01:25:24,219 --> 01:25:27,222
The operation will take place
in Caijiagou instead.

726
01:25:28,932 --> 01:25:29,850
Caijiagou?

727
01:25:30,392 --> 01:25:33,061
It's the transfer point between
the East and South railways.

728
01:25:33,145 --> 01:25:35,522
His Excellency's carriage
will have to stop

729
01:25:35,605 --> 01:25:37,441
in the railyard for some time.

730
01:25:37,983 --> 01:25:38,984
And Ahn Jung-geun?

731
01:25:39,526 --> 01:25:41,111
He's waiting at Caijiagou Station.

732
01:25:41,194 --> 01:25:42,070
Is that for certain?

733
01:25:42,154 --> 01:25:43,363
Yes.

734
01:25:45,449 --> 01:25:47,075
What took you so long?

735
01:25:49,453 --> 01:25:53,123
The train was late.
Nothing I can do about it.

736
01:25:54,082 --> 01:25:55,375
Let's go.

737
01:26:36,166 --> 01:26:37,501
Sit.

738
01:27:19,876 --> 01:27:22,004
The special train sent by Russia

739
01:27:22,379 --> 01:27:25,090
departed from Changchun yesterday
with Ito on board.

740
01:27:26,049 --> 01:27:29,803
It will arrive here at 6 a.m.

741
01:27:30,887 --> 01:27:33,265
Are you sure the train will stop here?

742
01:27:34,057 --> 01:27:37,769
This is the transfer point between
the East and South railways.

743
01:27:38,270 --> 01:27:40,981
So they'll have to stand by
in a double-track facility.

744
01:27:43,233 --> 01:27:44,776
How much time will we have?

745
01:27:56,705 --> 01:27:58,332
Fifteen minutes.

746
01:28:00,083 --> 01:28:04,129
It'll stop for 15 minutes
before it departs for Harbin.

747
01:28:08,300 --> 01:28:09,968
Where is Comrade Ahn?

748
01:28:11,553 --> 01:28:13,180
He'll arrive soon.

749
01:28:31,281 --> 01:28:32,824
It holds eight rounds.

750
01:28:33,241 --> 01:28:35,369
But you'll have to get very close.

751
01:28:35,952 --> 01:28:38,038
That puts me within
ten steps of the target.

752
01:28:38,121 --> 01:28:39,581
So escape's not an option.

753
01:28:42,793 --> 01:28:43,960
I know.

754
01:28:46,963 --> 01:28:49,549
Go with Kim Sang-hyun to Caijiagou.

755
01:28:50,342 --> 01:28:52,344
For this plan to succeed,

756
01:28:52,886 --> 01:28:55,055
you must be caught by Mori in Caijiagou.

757
01:28:56,515 --> 01:28:58,350
So you'll use me as bait?

758
01:28:59,685 --> 01:29:00,769
Are you up for it?

759
01:29:07,192 --> 01:29:09,111
What about Kim Sang-hyun?

760
01:29:11,279 --> 01:29:12,864
What would you prefer?

761
01:29:17,077 --> 01:29:19,246
Turncoats must be executed.

762
01:29:36,722 --> 01:29:38,682
Kim, why did you do it?

763
01:29:47,482 --> 01:29:49,985
Why would you become a mole?

764
01:30:15,302 --> 01:30:18,013
Is killing Ito going to
get us independence?

765
01:30:19,264 --> 01:30:23,393
If I talk to Mori, I can save you, Woo.

766
01:30:25,020 --> 01:30:27,022
We can get out of here alive, okay?

767
01:30:29,733 --> 01:30:32,694
You want to betray our comrades
so we can live?

768
01:30:33,945 --> 01:30:35,614
Would you rather we all die?

769
01:30:36,573 --> 01:30:40,452
We'll all die like dogs
and nobody will remember us!

770
01:30:50,128 --> 01:30:51,129
Kim Sang-hyun.

771
01:30:57,052 --> 01:30:58,845
Did you forget that I saved you?

772
01:31:03,725 --> 01:31:07,104
You promised to save my life once.

773
01:31:09,022 --> 01:31:11,525
And now you're going to shoot me?

774
01:31:15,445 --> 01:31:16,363
Do it.

775
01:31:18,448 --> 01:31:20,075
Do it, goddamnit.

776
01:31:21,284 --> 01:31:23,203
Shoot!

777
01:32:03,076 --> 01:32:04,411
They're in the station.

778
01:32:15,630 --> 01:32:16,965
I'm sorry.

779
01:32:19,134 --> 01:32:20,177
I just...

780
01:32:23,472 --> 01:32:25,098
wanted to live.

781
01:32:42,532 --> 01:32:46,328
We live in place of our dead comrades.

782
01:32:50,207 --> 01:32:51,750
Never forget that.

783
01:33:36,169 --> 01:33:37,879
Where is Ahn Jung-geun?

784
01:33:50,934 --> 01:33:52,728
Where is Ahn Jung-geun?

785
01:34:00,986 --> 01:34:02,029
Answer me!

786
01:34:02,988 --> 01:34:03,822
Answer me!

787
01:34:04,114 --> 01:34:04,948
Let go!

788
01:34:09,619 --> 01:34:10,454
Answer me!

789
01:34:16,209 --> 01:34:18,170
Where is Ahn Jung-geun?

790
01:34:29,890 --> 01:34:30,891
Harbin.

791
01:34:32,565 --> 01:34:37,093
Harbin Station, October 26, 1909.

792
01:35:21,608 --> 01:35:22,943
When Ito arrives,

793
01:35:23,735 --> 01:35:27,698
he'll meet the Russian Finance Minister,
Kokovtsov, on the train.

794
01:35:34,371 --> 01:35:36,581
"Long live Korea."

795
01:35:36,999 --> 01:35:38,667
How do you say that in Russian?

796
01:35:39,960 --> 01:35:41,920
Why do you want to know?

797
01:35:44,381 --> 01:35:48,719
Harbin is under Russian jurisdiction,
so I should say it in Russian.

798
01:35:54,516 --> 01:35:55,851
"Korea Ura."

799
01:35:57,269 --> 01:35:59,313
Korea Ura...

800
01:36:00,856 --> 01:36:02,774
Korea Ura.

801
01:36:05,068 --> 01:36:06,445
Will they understand?

802
01:36:06,945 --> 01:36:07,988
Yes.

803
01:36:08,864 --> 01:36:10,073
They'll understand you.

804
01:36:26,214 --> 01:36:27,758
I guess this is goodbye.

805
01:36:39,102 --> 01:36:44,399
Our fallen comrades
will help you from the heavens.

806
01:36:46,318 --> 01:36:47,486
Thank you.

807
01:36:58,705 --> 01:37:01,667
Welcome to Russia, Prime Minister.

808
01:37:07,130 --> 01:37:14,137
As I'm sure you're aware,
Harbin used to be Qing territory.

809
01:37:15,138 --> 01:37:19,726
Russia has only ruled over it briefly.

810
01:37:19,810 --> 01:37:21,436
Am I wrong?

811
01:37:31,488 --> 01:37:35,325
And Korea? Whose territory is that?

812
01:37:42,124 --> 01:37:43,625
Whose territory

813
01:37:44,459 --> 01:37:46,545
do you think it will become?

814
01:39:23,809 --> 01:39:24,643
Out of the way!

815
01:40:32,961 --> 01:40:34,463
Korea Ura!

816
01:40:35,255 --> 01:40:37,049
Korea Ura!

817
01:40:37,924 --> 01:40:39,926
Korea Ura!

818
01:40:40,427 --> 01:40:42,262
Korea Ura!

819
01:41:13,210 --> 01:41:14,252
How did it go?

820
01:41:17,422 --> 01:41:18,507
He succeeded.

821
01:41:21,593 --> 01:41:25,263
We must write an article
to let the world know.

822
01:41:29,226 --> 01:41:30,435
What should we open with?

823
01:41:39,861 --> 01:41:41,613
Here's how it'll go.

824
01:41:43,407 --> 01:41:46,994
"On October 26, 1909, in Harbin,

825
01:41:47,995 --> 01:41:51,832
Lt. General Ahn Jung-geun of
the Korean Independence Army

826
01:41:53,458 --> 01:41:54,668
fired a gun

827
01:41:56,753 --> 01:41:57,796
at Ito Hirobumi,

828
01:42:00,507 --> 01:42:01,842
exterminating him."

829
01:42:05,684 --> 01:42:10,195
Lushun Prison, China, March 26, 1910.

830
01:44:01,545 --> 01:44:03,255
Where have you been lately?

831
01:44:05,132 --> 01:44:06,550
Wandering here and there.

832
01:44:07,384 --> 01:44:10,345
Did you forget why
I let you go at Caijiagou?

833
01:44:13,265 --> 01:44:17,269
If it weren't for me,
you would have rotted in jail for life.

834
01:44:18,729 --> 01:44:19,980
Don't forget that.

835
01:44:21,106 --> 01:44:22,399
I'll always remember.

836
01:44:25,444 --> 01:44:28,488
And we have a new assignment for you.

837
01:44:32,576 --> 01:44:34,077
Do you know about Kim Ku?

838
01:44:36,413 --> 01:44:38,665
He's a big headache for us.

839
01:44:40,751 --> 01:44:42,252
Your mission...

840
01:44:47,132 --> 01:44:49,343
is to make contact with Kim Ku.

841
01:44:52,554 --> 01:44:53,555
Take this.

842
01:44:57,726 --> 01:44:59,019
Take it.

843
01:45:07,486 --> 01:45:11,365
And Woo was released from prison.

844
01:45:12,282 --> 01:45:14,493
He swore to find and kill me.

845
01:45:16,787 --> 01:45:18,413
Have you heard anything?

846
01:45:20,666 --> 01:45:24,294
He's coming to Harbin tomorrow
to meet Choi Jae-hyung.

847
01:45:26,129 --> 01:45:28,382
There's a safe house in Harbin.

848
01:45:30,968 --> 01:45:32,302
What's the address?

849
01:46:24,313 --> 01:46:26,023
We'll let Kim Sang-hyun live.

850
01:46:29,901 --> 01:46:32,321
Turncoats must be executed.

851
01:46:32,404 --> 01:46:33,488
Woo.

852
01:46:35,490 --> 01:46:37,659
Give him another chance.

853
01:46:38,285 --> 01:46:40,203
Right now, he's shaking in fear,

854
01:46:40,787 --> 01:46:42,831
but I believe he'll overcome it.

855
01:47:36,677 --> 01:47:40,889
The darkness will deepen,
and the wind will blow stronger.

856
01:47:42,933 --> 01:47:44,434
But we must keep the fire burning.

857
01:47:45,769 --> 01:47:47,229
People will gather.

858
01:47:47,896 --> 01:47:49,231
And when people gather,

859
01:47:50,190 --> 01:47:53,652
we will take the light
and walk through the darkness together.

860
01:47:55,696 --> 01:48:00,951
Whatever may confront us,
we will never back down.

861
01:48:02,285 --> 01:48:04,705
If we do not succeed this year,
we will try again the year after.

862
01:48:05,330 --> 01:48:08,583
Whether it takes one, two, ten,
or a hundred more years,

863
01:48:09,501 --> 01:48:15,215
we will stop only when
Korea's independence is restored.

864
01:48:16,216 --> 01:48:21,805
By advancing, falling back,
proceeding quickly and then slowly,

865
01:48:22,889 --> 01:48:26,601
preparing for tomorrow, the next day,
and all that lies before us,

866
01:48:27,686 --> 01:48:31,148
we will achieve our goal
one day for certain.

867
01:48:32,983 --> 01:48:35,652
We must keep going
until that day is upon us.

868
01:48:36,653 --> 01:48:41,033
Carrying the fire into the darkness.

869
01:48:51,882 --> 01:48:54,630
After Ito Hirobumi's death,
the Japanese government

870
01:48:54,655 --> 01:48:56,874
carried out special
powers and influence.

871
01:48:59,139 --> 01:49:05,059
The independence fighters continued
their fight to the end without giving up.

872
01:49:06,855 --> 01:49:12,295
After 36 years we finally
achieved independence.

873
01:49:13,779 --> 01:49:18,162
HARBIN
