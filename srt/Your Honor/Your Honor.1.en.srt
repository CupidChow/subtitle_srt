00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,600
She was always on his side.

169
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:54,700
He got good grades, was a model student.

170
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,500
That's probably why.

171
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,800
You always hate me.

172
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,600
You're going to have a terrible life!

173
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,720
Say that again.

174
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,700
Why did I give birth to you?

175
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,000
I wish I only had your older brother!

176
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,200
Huh?

177
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,600
Stop crying!

178
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,300
It hurts.

179
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,300
I was sad, lonely, and scared.

180
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,500
In middle school,

181
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,400
I learned how to take revenge.

182
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,600
Forget studying.

183
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,200
Let's get into fights.

184
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:49,200
You didn't think to study harder, prove her wrong?

185
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,200
Did you ever come first in the country?

186
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,500
First in the school?

187
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,300
No, first in the country.

188
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:59,000
He would be first in the country
at every exam he took.

189
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,200
With my grades, I couldn't win.

190
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,800
I hated him so much...

191
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,700
but one day, I saw him get beaten up.

192
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,800
Kick him.

193
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,900
Hey, get out of the way.

194
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,600
I'll make a pretty picture.

195
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,600
Even so, that was just wrong.

196
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,600
On that knife...

197
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,100
were only my fingerprints.

198
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,800
It's important that you tell the truth.

199
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,900
Did you see him take out the knife?

200
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,000
No.

201
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,800
I didn't.

202
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
That was your knife!

203
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,000
No!

204
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,100
Mom!

205
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
My mom said...

206
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,700
your brother would never lie.

207
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,000
So...

208
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,300
Hyung is telling the truth.

209
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,200
The day he got into college, first in the country...

210
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,800
I went to jail.

211
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,900
But my so-called brother

212
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,400
never came to visit once, not even the day I got out.

213
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,700
When I saw my mom cry

214
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,800
that felt so good.

215
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,500
But when she keeps crying

216
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,600
it doesn't feel good anymore.

217
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,800
Are you going to stop when I die?

218
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,100
If I died, will you stop?

219
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:11,000
But she'd never say sorry, my mom.

220
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:15,600
I just wanted to hear, I'm sorry.

221
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,600
But I'm the one who felt bad.

222
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,500
I got sick of it all.

223
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,100
My mom crying.

224
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,100
Living the way I did.

225
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:35,100
I was late, but I started studying.

226
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,700
But a friend from jail came to visit

227
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:42,900
and told me he would pay me
if I collected 10 won coins.

228
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,100
I asked him if that was illegal

229
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,100
but he said, he's running an arcade.

230
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,200
He promised it wasn't anything bad.

231
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,100
I didn't know anything.

232
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,300
Even if you didn't know, it's still a crime.

233
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,100
That's not fair!

234
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I...

235
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,800
I didn't know!

236
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,100
I didn't know it was a crime.

237
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:36,600
Everyone has their own wounds.

238
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:40,200
Successful people exaggerate them

239
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,100
and failed people do, too.

240
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,800
Both of them are fools.

241
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:50,700
Our past wounds don't make up all of our present.

242
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,200
Are any wounds really of the past?

243
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,400
All wounds are of the present.

244
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,400
I keep remembering and going crazy.

245
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,700
Do they go away if I hide them?

246
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,900
What about you? Does that work for you?

247
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,300
This is not a wound. It's a scar.

248
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,800
Let's get started.

249
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,300
Your testimony to the police,
is that what happened?

250
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,100
This is unfair.

251
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,500
Prosecutor!

252
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,600
Soo Ho!

253
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,500
Why did you come without notice?

254
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,300
You could've just called.

255
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,300
It's nothing.

256
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,800
Why does your face look so rough?

257
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,300
Do you have that much work every day?

258
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,600
Go back.

259
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,800
I'm on duty, I can't go home tonight.

260
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,400
I'll see you at grandfather's rites.

261
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,200
If you're busy, you don't have to come.

262
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,100
Soo Ho...

263
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,900
Mom.

264
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,600
I have a trial. I'm late.

265
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,400
Your brother Kang Ho...

266
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,000
Can we talk about this later?

267
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,200
Stop bringing me all this food!

268
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,400
I can't even finish them.

269
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:07,000
There's jangjorim, and galbijjim that you like...

270
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:10,000
Leave them with security. Thanks.

271
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,300
Good work.

272
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,200
So he's saying he didn't know anything...

273
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,500
You idiot.

274
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,800
Assume Jin Wook Tae was the
main perpetrator. He's vicious.

275
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,700
Beat him down a bit first.

276
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,300
I'll treat you after this.

277
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,000
Go ahead.

278
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,400
Yes.

279
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,100
You're here with a pretty girl tonight.

280
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,600
She's not a girl.

281
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,500
She's a new prosecutor.

282
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,900
A prosecutor lady.

283
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,800
Good work.

284
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,500
You need to be gutsy to do bigger jobs.

285
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,700
That's enough.

286
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,800
What's enough?

287
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,800
I don't drink much.

288
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,400
Start now.

289
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,300
It's your first time, right?

290
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,600
Pardon?

291
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,700
Interrogation, it was your first.

292
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,000
Oh, yes.

293
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,000
It was my first.

294
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:55,000
Alright... to Trainee Song

295
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,600
and her successful first time.

296
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,300
The interrogation was interesting.

297
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:22,100
You told them you didn't know
anything and I did it all?

298
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,800
You want me to be in solitary, right?

299
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,300
You're the main character.

300
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,000
I'm just a supporting actor.

301
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,400
See you when we get out.

302
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,000
I'll make you the main character of a tragedy.

303
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:37,100
I'll get six months, max.

304
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,300
You'll get a year at least.

305
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:41,500
Want to see who gets out first?

306
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,300
You know how much my lawyer cost?

307
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,600
1335!

308
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,200
Get inside.

309
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,600
[ Manslaughter, robbery, injury, blackmail ]

310
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,800
Look at that a**hole.

311
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,000
In front of his elders

312
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,200
lifting his chin like he's all that.

313
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,100
Crawl over here.

314
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,000
Hey, lower your eyes.

315
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,900
He's stressing me out.

316
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,560
Hey.

317
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,000
Aren't you Dang Jin's Sa Ma Ryong hyungnim?

318
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:24,430
Who's reading someone else's family tree?

319
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,600
It's Kang Ho, Hyungnim.

320
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,100
Han Kang Ho.

321
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,000
You don't remember?

322
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,500
Is it really Kang Ho? Huh?

323
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,000
Angry.

324
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Han Kang Ho.

325
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:49,700
You didn't recognize my face.

326
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,400
I almost got so sad, Hyungnim!

327
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,600
You changed your hair completely.

328
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,100
I didn't recognize you at all.

329
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,300
Right.

330
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,600
My Kang Ho.

331
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,100
Oh, Hyungnim!

332
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,300
Get him.

333
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,800
Who is this, Hyung?

334
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:23,600
You know... He's like fine dust pollution.

335
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,990
Tiny...

336
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,200
but fatal.

337
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,200
Get him good.

338
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,800
Did you decide where you'll go after graduation?

339
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,200
Oh, yes.

340
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,100
I'm thinking of the court, or prosecution.

341
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,900
Prosecutors are the flowers of the court.

342
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,700
Judges are old men in the back room.

343
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,200
If you're going to be a lawyer,

344
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:02,000
might as well go into low-level government service.

345
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:06,800
Yes. But my grades are sort of on the line.

346
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:10,300
I need to improve my scores
before making a decision.

347
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,300
Even if your grades aren't great

348
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:16,500
there is a way to ensure being
confirmed as a prosecutor.

349
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,400
Is there such a way?

350
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,400
I write the recommendation
at the end of your training.

351
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,800
Depends on what I write on there

352
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:30,000
you could get extra credit, or you
could get points taken off.

353
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:34,400
Whether you become a prosecutor or not

354
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,400
is up to this.

355
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:42,600
Yes. Thank you.

356
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,600
Prosecutors never ask favors from others.

357
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,300
You take care of your own things.

358
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,000
Yes. I'll do my best.

359
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,100
How?

360
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,600
Work hard...

361
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,700
Do it well...

362
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,400
Drink.

363
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,300
I've had enough.

364
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,200
The prosecution is an organization.

365
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,200
In an organization, you follow orders.

366
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,700
Trainee Song.

367
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,100
Yes.

368
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,600
You're talented. Be a prosecutor.

369
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,900
Thank you.

370
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,100
Just with words?

371
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:02,300
You want to go sleep with me?

372
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,200
I'm recording you.

373
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,700
Could you say that again?

374
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,800
I'll write a good recommendation.
Apply to be a prosecutor.

375
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,900
You're very determined. You'll do well.

376
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,600
You've had a bit to drink.

377
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,300
Go home and get some sleep.

378
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:45,700
We don't really pressure
employees to go out for drinks.

379
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,300
Are you okay, Your Honor?

380
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:11,900
Hey!

381
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,100
Leave it. She reeked of alcohol.

382
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,100
Geez.

383
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,600
What kind of people are you letting in?
