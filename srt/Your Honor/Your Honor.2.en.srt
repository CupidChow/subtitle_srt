[ So Eun ]

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,100
I'll see you at a less crowded bar next time.

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,900
Bring a lot of change, it's going to be a big game.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,100
Sure. I'll see you later.

6
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:30,000
Hey, do you think I close the door for some

7
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,400
green judge bast*** because I'm weak?

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,300
- How dare you be on your phone!
- I'm sorry.

9
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,300
You think you can inherit the firm with that attitude?

10
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,270
I told you not to show weaknesses!

11
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,200
I got it, Father.

12
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,100
Let's go prepare for the trial.

13
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,200
Unni, no!

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,200
Stop!

15
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,800
Oh, no!

16
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,700
What's going on that you asked for advice?

17
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,700
My mentor, Prosecutor Hong Jung Soo

18
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:12,700
forced me to go to a bar and drink
with him at 8 o'clock last night

19
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:15,120
and asked me to sleep with him.

20
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,100
That's it?

21
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,600
Yes.

22
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,700
So what?

23
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,600
I want to report him to the disciplinary committee

24
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,200
and charge him to the fullest extent of the law.

25
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,200
- Did you sleep with him?
- Excuse me?

26
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,700
I said, did you sleep with him?

27
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,200
No.

28
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,600
So what's the problem?

29
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,400
I'm saying...

30
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,400
the event I just told you about is the problem.

31
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,590
Why is that a problem? It's a compliment.

32
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:48,000
He's saying you're pretty, smart, and attractive
that he wants to sleep with you.

33
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,400
I would, too.

34
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,400
Of course, it might've been too much,

35
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,600
but a compliment is never too much, no?

36
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,900
Get back to work.

37
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,800
I...

38
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:06,000
believe this was sexual harassment, due to our ranks.

39
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,500
What you just said to me as well, legally...

40
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,600
Hey!

41
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,450
You must be crazy.

42
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:18,230
A mere trainee bringing up the law in front of me?

43
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,400
What's your name?

44
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,990
The head of the Judicial Training
Institute is my sunbae, b****.

45
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:26,230
You think you have the right to be
in law with that attitude?

46
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,610
Hey!

47
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,500
Yes.

48
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,100
- Call Hong Jung Soo.
- Okay.

49
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,600
A trainee lecturing a deputy prosecutor about the law?

50
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,670
I'm sorry.

51
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:41,520
You think I have time to be lectured by some trainee?

52
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,800
- I'll take care of it.
- Did you ask her to sleep with you?

53
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,900
That did not happen.

54
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,600
- I heard you did.
- From whom?

55
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,000
So what happened?

56
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,500
- You said it clearly at the bar-
- She did well yesterday, so I bought her a drink.

57
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,300
She must have been drunk.

58
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,780
At the end of our drinks, she seemed unhappy

59
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,800
and said she was recording us.

60
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,700
- Please check.
- You have a recording?

61
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,500
- That...
- Yes or no?

62
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,900
I said, you've had a bit to drink, go get some sleep.

63
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,300
Maybe she misunderstood that as let's sleep together.

64
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,100
Stop talking.

65
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,100
Play it.

66
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,200
You've had a bit to drink.
You should go get some sleep.

67
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:33,400
We don't really pressure
employees to go out for drinks.

68
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,500
Play it!

69
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,000
There is...

70
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,800
no recording.

71
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,090
Give me your phone.

72
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,680
We might be family, but a personal
phone without a warrant...

73
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,670
Get a warrant and get that idiot's phone.

74
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:53,380
If she deleted the recording, recover it
and figure out the truth.

75
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:57,170
You step down and go into lawyering,
or put her behind bars for libel.

76
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:59,570
A humiliated prosecutor is not a prosecutor.

77
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:01,370
I'm her mentor.

78
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:02,960
I'll give her a talk.

79
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,800

80
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,000
What? Who are you, b****?

81
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,500
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

82
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,900
How did this garbage get in here?

83
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,500
Get out!

84
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,700
Hey, Song.

85
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,000

You know what to do, right?

87
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,200
Yes.

88
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,300
Review the police report

89
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,400
and prepare background checks for the defendant.

90
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,560
No. That's what the prosecutor does.

91
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Just update the records.

92
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,200
For your level, that's more appropriate.

93
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,700
Your petition...

94
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,000
should be about fifty pages.

95
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,920
Am I writing a novel?

96
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,600
A judge handles more than a hundred cases a day.

97
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,500
How many letters do you think they get?

98
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,090
The pages should feel like a novel.

99
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:47,810
With your full heart in it, tearjerking to the reader.

100
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:50,580
Giving him a sentence in prison feels bad somehow.

101
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,660
Why?

102
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:54,580
Because the judge is also human.

103
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,200
Now! Let's go!

104

105
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,800
Stop.

106
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
- Is the judge honorable to you?
- I...

107
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,700
Besides General Yi Sun Shin and
Kim Yuna, no one is honorable to me.

108
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,820
The judge knows you don't think that.

109
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:17,550
But every letter says, "Your Honor."

110
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,430
Does he read it? No.

111
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,370
It's a lie from the very first line.

112
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,100
Write this down.

113
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,300
Dear Judge.

114

116

It's just a nice saying.

117
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,600
Write it down.

118
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:41,500
Dear... Judge.

119
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,900

120
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,900
writing this?

121
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,200
Shouldn't you write it for me?

122

- Dude.

Dear Judge.

128
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:10,100
I lost my parents at a young age,

129
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,330
and grew up with a stepmom

130
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:15,450
who did not raise me well...

131
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,800
Thinking about my mom

132
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,800
makes me tear up from the first page.

133
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,400
This might be more than a hundred pages.

134
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,300
Huh? Write.

135
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,200
You know what my dream was, right?

136
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,300
- To be a killer.
- Yeah.

137
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,300
I wanted to be a killer

138
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,400
but I didn't know how.

139
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,500
You messed up and got yelled at?

140
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,580
No.

141
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,700
I got yelled at for following the law.

142
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,600
By your mentor?

143
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,400
Nothing.

144
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,700
You were at a bar in Seochodong the other night, right?

145
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,800
Did something happen there?

146
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,250
I said nothing.

didn't you answer your phone?

149

No.

151
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,200
I'm worried you'll turn into a killer.

152

Then what?

153
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,000
It's illegal to be a killer.

154
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:16,800
Something really unfair happened, but legally,
there's a big disadvantage.

Would this person want to lean on the law

On the lawyer. That's what the job is for.

You can lean on me, too.

Give this support to Soo Ho.

169

Aren't we going home?

170
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,900
Sit.

171
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,300
Why sit?

172
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,800
Just sit here a bit.

173
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,800
The tics will kill you. We can talk at home.

174

Go home after sundown.

175
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:21,200
If you run into neighbors during
the day, it's embarrassing.

176
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Were you ever not embarrassed by me?

177

What are you embarrassed about now?

178
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,900
I don't care. You can wait until night.

179

Look.

180
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,850
If you do this and press this, you get a flashlight.

181
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:54,080
Don't fall over at night, making me
come and go. Have the light on.

182
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,200
You did the full six months, huh?

183
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,600
I missed you, waiting for you.

184
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,700
I still have one hand.

185

Let's review.

186
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:48,130
I gave you 100 million won, right?

187
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,700
To change into coins.

188

- So?
- Where did they all go?

189
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,460
I changed half of it to coins and gave them to you.

190
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,600
The rest... the police took for evidence.

191
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,400
Why did you lose the money I gave you?

192
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,900
Give my money back. 50 million won.

193
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,300
Sue me.

194

Hey, hey!

195
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,400
I don't want to be tied up with
you, never come here again.

196

Yes. I'm getting ready.

Where's the meat?

202
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,800
Are you a vegetarian now?

You can't tell?

Are you sick anywhere?

206
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:45,200
I'm not hurt anywhere, why
would I be sick anywhere?

207

Go to your dad's grave tomorrow.
You should say hello.

208

How would a dead guy know if I came by or not?

209

Give your brother a call, too.

210

Without your dad, your brother is
the head of the household.

Oh, I'm Kang Ho's friend.

I already called the police, you don't have to.

Hey, they're saying five weeks treatment
for where you hit me earlier.

219

You know for more than three weeks,
it's plenty for imprisonment?

Doctor's note for the police.

The complaint.

222
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,600
The letter of a fulfillment of monetary
obligation for 50 million won.

223
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,000
Hospital bills... here's a settlement letter.

224
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,600
This is... a letter to drop all charges.

225
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,100
If you sign the letter of a fulfillment of
monetary obligation, I'll drop the charges.

226

do you have to show me?

You're going to see your brother, right?

Why would I visit that bastard?

go see him, you'll ruin his future.

Don't make him worry about you.

00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,410
Your Honor, your robe!

335
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:25,300
The robe, right.

336
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,400
- You should go with him.
- Yes.

337
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,300
- Your tie!
- My tie.

338
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,300
Here!

339
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:38,600
Everyone else needs to be sent to the
press room immediately after the trial.

340
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:41,360
The press judge will give a briefing to the reporters.

341
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:45,200
If you need a separate press
release, you can let them know.

342
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,900
All rise.

343
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,800
You may take your seats.

344
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,900
The sentencing.

345
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,700
Let's begin.

346
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:09,200
♫ I live another weary day  ♫

347
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,000
♫ Is it okay if I lean on you?  ♫

348
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,100
♫ You brought me small comfort in my life  ♫

349
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,500
♫ Like a giant  ♫

350
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:23,800
♫ The world is so much bigger...  ♫
