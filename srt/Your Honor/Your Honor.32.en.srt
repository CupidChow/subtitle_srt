Defendant, closing statement, please.

170
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:50,770
Someone I know

171
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:54,970
said that he "messed" with the law.

172
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,220
I didn't know what that meant.

173
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,210
He...

174
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:05,350
also wanted to "avenge" the law.

175
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:10,530
I did not understand
what that meant, either.

176
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:16,190
Only after being here, a spot I thought
I would never be standing on,

177
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:21,190
I understand why he said those things.

178
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:26,450
But if I saw him again,

179
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,820
I want to...

180
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:33,970
tell him that the law is always
on the side of the truth.

181
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:40,240
Right now, the only thing I trust

182
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,680
is just that one thing.

183
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,730
That's all.

184
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,840
I will announce the sentence
next Thursday.

185
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,780
All rise.

What?

188
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:13,750
- I have a favor to ask.
- Don't.

189
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,490
Write a letter of appeal.

190
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,350
- I'm hanging up.
- Hey, Han Soo Ho.

191
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,350
I don't ask you for favors.

192
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:22,300
- So you don't ask me, either.
- Fine.

193
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:26,080
Let's say I did a hundred
wrong things to you.

194
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,240
I apologize for all of them.

195
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,000
They were all my fault.

196
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,780
I sincerely apologize.

197
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,230
No need.

198
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:36,360
If my being born was my fault,

199
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,320
I acknowledge and
apologize for that, too.

200
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,630
I'm busy. I can't talk.

201
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:43,530
Hold on, hold on. Just one second.

202
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:47,500
Hyung!

203
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:52,040
Please help me just this one time.

204
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,620
Please.

205
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:07,260
Tell me briefly what this is about.

[ Defendant Song So Eun ]

208
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,300
As you already know,

209
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:21,310
I called for cross-examining because
there is an additional witness.

210
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:24,860
If nothing special comes up, I will
announce the sentence in the afternoon.

211
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,320
First...

212
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,880
I have a couple of questions for the victim about
the letter of appeal that was submitted.

213
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,050
Yes.

214
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:35,190
The disciplinary committee for Han Soo Ho,
Judge for the Seoul District Court Criminal Branch.

215
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:37,600
You were asked to be on it
as an external member?

216
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,810
I was.

217
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:40,970
Before the disciplinary hearing started,

218
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:42,900
in front of the hearing room,

219
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:47,170
did you see the defendant
with Judge Han Soo Ho?

220
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:48,510
I did.

221
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:51,860
Do you remember what you said
to the defendant at that moment?

222
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,430
Trainee Song,

223
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:55,570
you've gotten even prettier.

224
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,890
Gained some curves.

225
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:59,820
Looks good.

226
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:04,210
I remember it as an ordinary greeting.

227
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:06,960
"Gained some curves," "If a woman is
too skinny, not attractive,"

228
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,660
"Sexy," et cetera.

229
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:11,080
Did you say anything that could be
misconstrued as sexual harassment?

230
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,430
I did not.

231
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:15,430
Judge Han Soo Ho wrote this
letter of appeal himself.

232
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:17,500
Are you saying a former judge

233
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,320
is lying?

234
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,890
I do not have a memory
of saying such things.

235
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:24,480
Do you not have memories,
or do you not have facts?

236
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,350
I... don't remember very well.

237
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,890
Try.

238
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:31,010
It wasn't that long ago.

239
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:34,000
I do not remember.

240
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,890
Yes.

241
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:38,040
If you can't, nothing can be done.

Yes.

Is that you?

246
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:29,130
It is.

247
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:33,950
Take your witness oath.

248
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,460
I swear

249
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:42,120
that I will tell the truth, the whole truth

250
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,010
and nothing but the truth

251
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:45,860
under pains and penalties of perjury.

252
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:48,120
So help me God.

253
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,170
Witness Han Kang Ho.

254
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,150
What is your relationship to the defendant?

255
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:04,700
When I was being interrogated
for damaging currency,

256
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,000
she was the prosecution
trainee in charge.

257
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,150
According to the defendant's
testimony, when she was a trainee,

258
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:13,140
her mentor prosecutor sexually harassed her.

259
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,810
- Did you witness that yourself?
- Yes.

260
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:18,520
Could you describe what you saw?

261
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,910
The trainee did the initial interrogation,

262
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:24,650
and the person who appeared to be
her mentor entered the interrogation room.

263
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,520
The real culprit is Jin Wook Tae.

264
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,290
He's a vicious one.

265
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:35,640
Make him feel defeated.

266
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,000
After you're done, I'll buy you a drink.

267
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,760
Did you clearly see that happening?

268
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,270
Yes.

269
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:48,320
Please identify that trainee.

270
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,870
She is sitting there.

271
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:01,380
Could you clearly point her
out with your finger?

272
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:04,140
It's not nice to point at people.

273
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,100
I see.

274
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:08,860
It's the person sitting in the
defendant's seat, correct?

275
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,430
Correct.

276
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:15,370
Then, who was the person who
appeared to be the prosecutor?

277
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:17,220
Could you point him out?

278
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,290
Yes.

279
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:24,180
That moron over there.

280
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,090
Objection!

281
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:29,930
He is a serial criminal with five records.

282
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:31,560
His testimony has no credibility.

283
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,840
Overruled.

284
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,790
The witness has a record of
being interrogated by the victim.

285
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:39,120
He could be trying to sabotage the victim.

286
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,570
He is not a credible witness.

287
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:41,980
Overruled.

288
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,320
Have a seat.

289
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,070
Prosecution,

290
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:58,930
given the content of Judge
Han Soo Ho's letter of appeal,

291
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:01,350
should Judge Han Soo Ho and
Prosecutor Hong Jung Soo

292
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:03,760
be cross-examined?

293
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:10,490
A letter of appeal cannot
serve as evidence in court.

294
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:12,530
I do not think further
investigation is necessary.

295
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:16,600
We are adjourned.

296
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,500
I will sentence this afternoon.

297
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:34,560
All rise.

298
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:41,810
Please be seated.

299
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:52,260
Defendant Song So Eun,

300
00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:01,140
your testimony has been consistent
throughout the investigation and in court.

301
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,150
Holding it up against the
witness testimony,

302
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:08,080
it appears that acts causing
you humiliation did occur.

303
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:12,430
Therefore, it is hard to determine
that your charges were fabricated.

304
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:15,880
The defendant did not demand
money from the victim,

305
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:19,880
and there is no evidence to
suggest a motivation for libel.

306
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,700
I conclude that the
defendant's charges

307
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,950
were not fabricated out
of maliciousness.

308
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:28,820
Therefore, I declare the
defendant not guilty.

309
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,700
We are adjourned.

310
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,260
All rise.

311
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,180
What is this?

312
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:30,500
Angle? What is that?

313
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:34,200
It's an angel. How can you
call it an angle?

314
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,760
This will last your entire life.
What are you going to...

315
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,430
What are you going to do?

316
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:57,550
How did you fool me so well?

317
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:59,130
I'm sorry.

318
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:03,520
When you lie like that, isn't it scary?

319
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,820
I was going to run away.

320
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,140
You couldn't because of me?

321
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:14,630
It's my fault.

322
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:18,380
I should have known when you told me
to summarize the main points.

323
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:22,840
I should have suspected it when
you handed over all your rulings.

324
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,240
When you told me to fix the
Chinese character...

325
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,480
I should have realized.

326
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:30,540
But...

327
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:33,870
thank you for finding my sister.

328
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:36,300
Oh, it's nothing.

329
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:39,140
What else do I need to thank you for?

330
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:43,660
I'm a trial researcher now.

331
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:46,520
I know.

332
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,090
I have a lawyer license too.

333
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:52,100
I have a culinary license.

334
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,270
Korean cuisine and Western cuisine.

335
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:56,220
Make me a meal, then.

336
00:26:57,610 --> 00:27:00,450
At least once. You promised.

337
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:03,200
What do you like?

338
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,940
What are you good at?

339
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:08,310
Anything.

340
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:11,180
Then make me anything.

341
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:13,790
Let's talk over food.

342
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,720
When you are no longer in pain

343
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,910
this will break.

344
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:35,170
♫ The world has never
listened to my story ♫

345
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:45,140
♫ I speak and I speak, but it
all just comes back as a low echo ♫

346
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:54,000
♫ We all live weary days, is it
okay to lean on each other? ♫

347
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:01,700
♫ Your small comfort gave me
shadows in my life, like a giant ♫

348
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:08,710
♫ My everything, all of it... ♫
