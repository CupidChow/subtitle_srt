1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:04,300
I've never seen this much money
before in my life.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,410
This is crazy.

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:06,940
Where should I spend this?

4
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,310
Wherever you want.

5
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:10,320
Can I do anything with it?
This much money?

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,930
It's not that much, thinking
about your future, Your Honor.

7
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,270
Then I'll be extravagant.

8
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,300
First, I'm buying clothes.

9
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,440
Shoes.

10
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,310
An imported car.

11
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,180
A trip abroad.

12
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,850
Entertainment. No.

13
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:29,560
I need to buy some land.

14
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,580
If I take this much out to buy land...

15
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,330
then nothing's left.

16
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,400
A billion won isn't that much after all.

17
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,380
So little.

18
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:46,610
Did I upset you somehow?

19
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:48,240
No.

20
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:53,100
I like how you think.
Money buys everything.

21
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,000
So honest and earnest.

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,170
They say it's dirty to like money,

23
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:58,830
but I don't agree.

24
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:01,970
So why are you acting like...

25
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,730
It's just that

26
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,810
I hate you guys.

27
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:10,450
If you tell me what I did wrong,

28
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:12,320
I will fix the misunderstanding.

29
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,880
There's someone I really like right now.

30
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,570
Is there someone you like, ahjussi?

31
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:21,960
I am married.

32
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,680
Having a family is good.

33
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,380
Try not to like anyone.

34
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,400
Do not like your wife.

35
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,300
Or your son or daughter.
Don't like anyone.

36
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,190
Ever.

37
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:35,800
A bad guy

38
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,370
does not have the right to like someone.

39
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,290
Your Honor!

40
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,550
What was that?

41
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,770
Long time no see, Your Honor.

42
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:13,680
Park Jae Hyung?

43
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,020
Yes.

44
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:18,280
- Are you here to kidnap me again?
- Yes.

45
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,570
You got the wrong person.

46
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:21,530
I...

47
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,200
His twin brother must be somewhere.

48
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,640
He's not.

49
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,830
I've looked around here for hours.

50
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:31,750
Hurry up.

51
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:58,000
This kind of thing is my specialty.

52
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:08,200
What's it like to be on the
other side of judgment?

53
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,410
Let's share our names first.

54
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,570
You're that kind of guy.

55
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:18,460
No matter how much I cried and shouted,

56
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,310
you didn't know who I was.

57
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,560
I'm Bang Woo Jung,

58
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,640
Jae Ho's fiancé.

59
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,430
Nice to meet you.

60
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,790
Bang Woo Jung?

61
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:32,370
I...

62
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:35,130
am Judge Han Soo Ho's brother,

63
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:37,620
Han Kang Ho.

64
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,690
What?

65
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,290
You don't know this, but

66
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:43,050
we're twins.

67
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:46,030
My brother is a judge, and I am me.

68
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,030
I know you are twins.

69
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,480
We followed you out of court.

70
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:04,490
Is everyone who comes
out of court a judge?

71
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,310
Do you want to live that badly?

72
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:21,490
My work is done.

73
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,860
It's not me.

74
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:37,810
Apologize to Jae Ho.

75
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,580
Apologize and

76
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,050
die.

77
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:45,310
My f***ing brother did it!

78
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:48,330
The whole world wanted Jae Ho dead.

79
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,210
But the judge should have said no.

80
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,090
[ This is Judge Han Soo Ho. Let's talk. ]
You are the law.

81
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,900
You should not have.

82
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,580
I'm Han Kang Ho.

83
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,280
I'm not Han Soo Ho!

84
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,520
Wait!

85
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,240
Hello?

86
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,760
Who are you?

87
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,180
Seoul Central Court Criminal Division

88
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,310
Judge Han Soo Ho.

89
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,250
I'd like to meet up.

90
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,330
With Bang Woo Jung, too.

91
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:29,290
You pick the time and place.

92
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:31,570
I'll call you back. Wait.

93
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:34,600
What? Who was that?

94
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,610
Judge Han Soo Ho.

95
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:48,940
What are you going to do?

96
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,660
I need to get him.

97
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:53,590
Kill one or kill both.

98
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:20,620
I heard about the case.

99
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,140
Are you going to kill Soo Ho?

100
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,150
After you kill him, what will you do?

101
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:30,400
What are you going to do with me?

102
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,650
You can kill Soo Ho, but

103
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm an innocent citizen.

104
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,100
I...

105
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:39,260
Hey!

106
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,730
If you do this kind of thing, later...

107
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:15,850
The call is not going through.
After the beep...

108
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:23,360
Your Honor, what's up?

109
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,000
Okay! I'm glad you caught him!

110
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,780
Look, that's Han Soo Ho!

111
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,740
Ask him if that's true or not!

112
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:40,510
Untie this and let's talk.

113
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:41,930
Don't get it twisted.

114
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:44,190
We didn't meet you to talk.

115
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,500
Who is Han Soo Ho? Be clear.

116
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,150
I am Han Soo Ho.

117
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:51,320
That's right! A judge does not lie!

118
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,980
If you want to prove it further,

119
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:55,360
take off his shirt.

120
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,920
On his right arm.

121
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:03,290
Hey, hey, hey!

122
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:08,440
Judges usually do not get tattoos.

123
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,960
Don't think about it too hard.

124
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,840
Let's kill Han Soo Ho first

125
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,590
and deal with the rest later.

126
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:29,550
Apologize to Jae Ho first.

127
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,560
Then you'll die.

128
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,810
It's true that Park Jae Ho killed his mother.

129
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:44,370
Whether he had a low IQ,
whatever his intent was,

130
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:48,080
the act of killing another human being

131
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,180
does not change.

132
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:53,400
I chose a sentence that is
fitting for that act.

133
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,350
You're lying!

134
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:59,290
The criminal intent shown
in the media was not the problem.

135
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:01,370
I just went by the law according to the act.

136
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,340
Do you know my brother?

137
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,240
What do you know?

138
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,110
How is someone like you the law?

139
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,470
Huh?

140
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:15,530
Hey!

141
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,670
Send me home!

142
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:22,080
I had nothing to do with it!

143
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,890
How can you say that when
your brother is about to die?

144
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,290
If it weren't for that bastard,
I wouldn't be here.

145
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:29,740
If it's hard to kill him, let me know. I'll help.

146
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,890
Shut up and stay still

147
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:34,200
before I kill you first.

148
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,260
Is that your apology?

149
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,790
An unfortunate upbringing.

150
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:47,750
A developmental disability.
Taking those into consideration,

151
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:50,510
I could have sentenced about ten years.

152
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,570
But...

153
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:57,890
I wanted to end the trial quickly...

154
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:01,270
and there were some agreements.

155
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:04,450
Who agrees with whom
about such a thing?

156
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:06,240
A year...

157
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,090
or ten. You should have
figured out the truth.

158
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:13,160
How could you rule like that?

159
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,880
It's my fault.

160
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,340
But...

161
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:22,350
it does not change the fact
that he killed his mother.

162
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,120
Jae Ho...

163
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:33,300
listens to everyone he likes.

164
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,410
He said his mother asked him to.

165
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:40,320
He has no idea what life or death is.

166
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,530
Did you research the visitation logs?

167
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,310
Has it occurred to you that
he might have died

168
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:48,500
because you told him to?

169
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,100
I messed up the trial.

170
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,730
You messed up your words.

171
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:59,920
We are accomplices.

172
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,710
If this is really for Park Jae Ho,

173
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:06,150
get a retrial.

174
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,410
I did nothing wrong.

175
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:15,290
I did nothing wrong.

176
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:20,000
This is all...

177
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,040
your fault!

178
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,540
Let's stop right there!

179
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:06,090
You call yourself a judge?

180
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:10,950
I am going to tell mom about
everything that happened today.

181
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:13,840
She always says you are the best,

182
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,770
but I am so curious what
her reaction will be.

183
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:25,900
It's okay.

184
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:34,160
Park Jae Ho's case was
pushed to the forefront

185
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,030
to cover up a drug case involving
the sons of powerful families.

186
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:39,380
He knew that, and still

187
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:42,220
that so-called judge sentenced
the death penalty.

188
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:48,400
If you really want revenge, appeal

189
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,030
and put that guy on the stand.

190
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,700
Make him say he was wrong

191
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,270
on the witness stand.

192
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:58,150
Make him repent.

193
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,660
And if he doesn't,

194
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,190
still forgive him.

195
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,940
Even if I die,

196
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,740
our mom will live.

197
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:14,420
But if Hyung dies, our mom will die.

198
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,860
Our mom...

199
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,720
only cares about Hyung.

200
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:20,850
We lost everything

201
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:22,930
and you want everything.

202
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:25,210
I have nothing anyway.

203
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:30,550
No money, no family.

204
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,810
Our mom...

205
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:38,340
removed me from the family
register when I was young.

206
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,510
I have five criminal records.

207
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:42,760
She says that my coming
home is embarrassing.

208
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,660
I can't know

209
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:48,140
what you two are feeling.

210
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,270
And even if you cannot forgive

211
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:52,250
my stupid hyung,

212
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,210
please don't kill him.

213
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:57,940
I beg you.

214
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,470
Did you use me as bait?

215
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:19,870
They kidnap me, you show
up and act all smart?

216
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:22,420
You volunteered to be bait.

217
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:25,580
Wow. You're so-called hyung.

218
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:28,610
That is so you. You really are Han Soo Ho.

219
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:30,950
Extremely annoying.

220
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:33,700
I don't care if you die, so

221
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,110
watch your own neck.

222
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,890
I know I don't deserve to be a judge.

223
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:32,130
A few days ago,

224
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,030
I resigned.

He's a great lawyer.

226
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:44,450
If you contact him, he'll help with the retrial.

227
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,340
I will be a witness.

228

Come see me anytime.

229
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:55,290

230

I'm going to go in tomorrow and pack up.

Don't you dare come near the court.

How are you going to run a trial?

241

It's the last ruling my trainee
wrote, so I have to read it.

You know each other by
face and name, right?

247
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,950
I apologize for fighting
Han Young unintentionally.

248

We are always following Ohdaeyang's power.

249

So old-fashioned.

250
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,720
I heard that these days, you should get to the
point first and save the small talk for later.

251
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,230
Why don't you discuss how much you'll
pay me for this blind date?

252
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:41,520
The bidding on the government
land looks promising, yes?

253
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,370
We are hoping for a smart
decision by the government.

254
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:46,950
If O Sung loses the bid,
according to the process,

255
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:49,150
we will file an administrative lawsuit.

256
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:51,730
There are no problems with the process.

257
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:55,650
The announcement should have been confirmed
before the final deadline, fourteen days ago,

258
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:57,670
but it was changed thirteen days ago

259
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:00,950
in case O Sung loses, to use as retaliation.

260
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:03,640
You're here to make waves.

261
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,840
Is this Ohdaeyang's doing?

262
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,000
This is an 11 trillion won project.

263
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,200
We are not willing to hand it
off to Han Young.

264

Let's join forces.

266

Would your father let that happen?

267
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,710
My father will be arrested
along with Lee Ho Sung.

268
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:29,530
In the olden days, grownups were scary.

269

But these days, young people are scarier.

270
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,510
What are your terms?

271
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:35,540
An ongoing partnership.

272
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:38,810
If not, we have no reason to abandon O Sung.

273

It's unlike him.

Is he sick, or did he get into an accident?

That can't be, right?

279

Maybe you should go to his house.

280
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,970
If we had a trial or something, I would.

281
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:16,680

there's no urgent matter.

That's personal information, so I can't.

335
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,970
Mom?

336
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:47,370
Come home this weekend
with your brother.

337
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:48,860
I'm busy.

338
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,000
Speak to your brother and
come down together.

339
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,630
I can't see you two like that anymore.

340
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:56,200
You said I should never see you again.

341
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,800
What changed your mind?

342
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:01,870
I have something to tell you. Come
together this weekend. No matter what.

343
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:04,490
If not, I'm coming up there.

344
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:10,240
My sons are coming.

345
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,740
You have the good stuff you hide away
in the fridge, right? I'll take that.

346
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:32,790
Geez, they hit the back of my head.

347
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,550
So Eun, it's me.

348
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:59,900
I'm okay.

349
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,910
Where are you? Are you off work already?

350
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:29,020
So Eun, it's me!

351
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,480
I'm sorry.

352
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,110
You were worried, right?

353
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,660
No.

354
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,790
I fell down on my way home.

355
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:09,710
I kind of cracked the back of my head.

356
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:12,740
So I have a big headache.

357
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:16,420
I meant to go to sleep, and passed out...

358
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,810
I'm so sorry I didn't call.

359
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:20,400
I mean...

360
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,990
Did you get hurt badly?

361
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,850
A little.

362
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:30,490
You told me you would let
me know if you got hurt.

363
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,720
Is something wrong?

364
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:45,440
Someone from the administration came.

365
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:50,040
He took all the records except
the one for the trial tomorrow.

366
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,240
Why?

367
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,000
Why did they take my stuff?

368
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,420
Because Your Honor, you resigned.

369
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:04,130
- I meant to tell you.
- When?

370
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:07,400
Before or after you resigned?

371
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,170
I'm sorry I didn't tell you before.

372
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:13,570
You said you would stay with
me until I finished.

373
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,960
I'm sorry.

374
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:24,470
Although I have fewer than
ten days of training,

375
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,760
it seems you're quitting.

376
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:32,520
See you tomorrow.

377
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,090
I came to see your face.
I thought you might be worried.

378
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:39,420
I worried all day.

379
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:43,250
Why am I so worried about you?

380
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:46,380
I was worried about myself

381
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,700
since I couldn't do anything but worry.

382
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:52,790
Hey, let it go.

383
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:56,480
After you're done training,
I'll come by with flowers.

384
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,770
I'll get the biggest bouquet.

385
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:01,670
You're not my mentor judge anymore.

386
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:04,280
Yes.

387
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:09,310
We don't have a work relationship.

388
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:12,300
I have nothing to report to you.

389
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:14,750
Yes.

390
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,020
You're not my superior anymore, either.

391
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,590
I've never thought of us that way.

392
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:30,830
Anyway...

393
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:34,720
we're no longer trainee and judge.

394
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:55,030
I'm leaving.

395
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:56,450
See you tomorrow.

396
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,210
Stay over.

397
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:24,670
♫ Story, my story ♫

398
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:32,150
♫ Your shouts can't heal my wounds ♫

399
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:38,670
♫ I don't want to be without you ♫

400
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:45,460
♫ I remember the times we had together ♫

401
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:55,930
♫ Story, my story ♫

402
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:59,530
♫ No matter how much I shout... ♫
